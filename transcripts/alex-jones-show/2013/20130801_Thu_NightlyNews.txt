[00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:23.800]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.661]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.923]  It's Thursday, August the 1st, 2013, and here are our top stories.
[00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:36.268]  Tonight, the Pentagon is giving Al Qaeda contracts in Afghanistan.
[00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:40.691]  Putin refuses Eric Holder's extradition request for Snowden.
[00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:47.395]  And InfoWars Nightly News has a chance to talk to the winner of the Operation Paul Revere contest.
[00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:51.278]  All this and more tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.801]  Well, do you remember when Rachel Maddow ridiculed Alex Jones for pointing out the connections between the U.S.
[00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:02.861]  government and Al Qaeda?
[00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:05.182]  You saw them stage Fast and Furious.
[00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:06.742]  Folks, they staged Aurora.
[00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.163]  They staged Sandy Hook.
[00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:09.563]  The evidence is just overwhelming.
[00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:15.344]  He also says the evidence is overwhelming that President Obama is now personally the global head of Al Qaeda.
[00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:17.625]  See, folks, the evidence is just overwhelming.
[00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:18.665]  Do I have to spell it out for you?
[00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:19.585]  Are you blind?
[00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:22.886]  Well, no one is more blind than those who refuse to see.
[00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.667]  Now, this is a story from Prison Planet.
[00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.275]  But this is also a story from Bloomberg.
[00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:35.658]  Bloomberg is not known to be a small government advocacy outlet.
[00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:38.599]  So this is what Bloomberg reported.
[00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.680]  I am deeply troubled that the U.S.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.742]  military can pursue, attack, and even kill terrorists and their supporters, but that some of the U.S.
[00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:47.583]  government believe we cannot prevent these same people
[00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:50.505]  From receiving a government contract.
[00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:57.110]  Now that is a quote from Joe Sopko, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.
[00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.613]  So we have Bloomberg quoting an Inspector General of the U.S.
[00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:07.338]  government saying, even though these people are terrorists, we can't stop them from getting a government contract.
[00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:13.239]  And he goes on to say, they may be enemies of the United States, but that's not enough to keep them from getting government contracts.
[00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:28.643]  He said, while the Obama administration is funding, equipping, and training al-Qaeda extremists in Syria to overthrow the Assad government, it is also awarding contracts to al-Qaeda after a decade-plus long war against the quote-unquote terrorists in Afghanistan.
[00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:30.224]  Well, this is nothing new.
[00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.190]  Rachel Maddow can read this in the headlines today.
[00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.810]  She could have read it in the headlines a long time ago.
[00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.291]  The government created Al Qaeda to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
[00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:50.214]  Bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki were CIA assets and they continue to fund them as well as run a massive drug war operation out of Afghanistan.
[00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:56.736]  It has been pointed out in the past by other news outlets, although we reported it here as well, that
[00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:06.931]  Worldwide poppy production out of Afghanistan was only 10% of the worldwide poppy production, and now it has risen to over 90% after the U.S.
[00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:10.353]  military went there to assist them in doing that function.
[00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:12.714]  So it's a part of the drug war story as well.
[00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:17.756]  But now, the real aid to Al-Qaeda is going to happen after we leave, perhaps.
[00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:19.077]  Big aid to them.
[00:03:19.637 --> 00:03:26.080]  Also reported from Infowars, NATO leaves live munitions behind at abandoned Afghan Air Force bases.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:36.265]  The U.S.-led military coalition in Afghanistan has agreed to do a better job of cleaning up deadly unexploded munitions from its bases and firing ranges as it closes them down after the U.N.
[00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:39.847]  accused the coalition of leaving dangerous explosives behind.
[00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:47.774]  So-called explosive remnants of war have emerged in the past few months as an increasing danger to civilians, in particular children.
[00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:52.599]  In the first half of the year nearly 150 people were killed or injured when such munitions detonated.
[00:03:52.619 --> 00:04:05.571]  Well right now they're just talking about carelessly left behind unexploded ammunition, but we have seen as the government has pulled out of one country after the other after their war that they leave behind massive military bases filled with all kinds of equipment
[00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:10.373]  And usually, after we leave a country, the people that we were there to fight usually take over.
[00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:14.875]  So, of course, that's going to be Al-Qaeda, but then we kind of put them in power to start with.
[00:04:16.075 --> 00:04:17.876]  But it's not just the wars that we know about.
[00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:20.357]  The Pentagon has secret wars.
[00:04:20.437 --> 00:04:22.598]  This is a story that was broken by the New American.
[00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:27.280]  Pentagon's secret wars, you don't even have a right to know.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.742]  When asked by senators to identify the groups being fought, the Pentagon said, it's a secret.
[00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:39.104]  If the organizations are infiltrated enough to be targeted with military force, why can't they be mentioned publicly?
[00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:45.587]  There's a countervailing, very important interest in the public knowing who the government is fighting against in its name.
[00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:49.730]  And that's a quote from Jack Goldsmith of Harvard University Law School.
[00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:58.074]  Now, another study done by another Harvard professor and by a professor from UCLA is titled, How Many Wars is the U.S.
[00:04:58.154 --> 00:04:58.874]  Fighting Today?
[00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.556]  And they estimate in their study that the U.S.
[00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:07.639]  government is fighting at least five, quote, unannounced and undeclared wars around the world.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.740]  Well, we know that the U.S.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.603]  government helped to fund and create Al Qaeda, but who is really controlling the U.S.
[00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:16.023]  government?
[00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:22.177]  We've all heard of the free Obama phone.
[00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:27.223]  We know that Obama used the free Obama phone to reach more people during the campaign.
[00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:40.767]  Did you know to get a free Obama phone, all you have to do is income qualify?
[00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:43.748]  And you don't really have to necessarily show proof.
[00:05:44.268 --> 00:05:51.990]  They say you're supposed to get food stamps, some kind of government assistance, or be on welfare, but a lot of times people can get a phone without any proof at all.
[00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.531]  Like all good ideas, they start off great.
[00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:58.472]  Then the government gets a hold of it, loads it up, and then it gets out of control.
[00:05:59.252 --> 00:06:01.893]  The Obama Phone Program is called Lifeline.
[00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:15.198]  It's provided by Safelink Wireless, which is a program for income-eligible households, provided by Tracfone Wireless, owned by America Movil, which belongs to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.
[00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:29.563]  So Mexico is funding Obama's campaign through the Obama phone and the tax you pay on your cell phone goes back to Mexico so that they can provide phones and service to the enslaved welfare recipients so that they can continue to vote to keep their free phones.
[00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:33.406]  I'm Gigi Ornette with an InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
[00:06:35.606 --> 00:06:38.928]  Well there's been new developments in the crimes committed by the NSA.
[00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:44.072]  That's right, this is not a story about Edward Snowden or where he's going or where he's going to stay.
[00:06:44.372 --> 00:06:49.195]  This is about the crimes committed by the NSA and some people at the Black Hat Conference understand that.
[00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:55.860]  Our nation takes stopping terrorism as one of the most important things.
[00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:57.401]  Freedom!
[00:06:58.362 --> 00:06:58.902]  Exactly.
[00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:01.324]  Don't say they don't trust you!
[00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:14.020]  Well, General Alexander has read the Constitution.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.641]  He just doesn't care what it says.
[00:07:16.282 --> 00:07:21.025]  And when he says this is about freedom, he's lying about that as well, just as he lied to Congress.
[00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:26.709]  Now, the Black Hat Conference is a place where both hackers and the government go
[00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:27.249]  We're good to go.
[00:07:51.621 --> 00:08:00.990]  Now there was another hacker that everybody expected to be presenting there, Barnaby Jack, and he has in past years shown some remarkable things at Black Hat.
[00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.655]  He was going to talk about how easy it is to hack into medical devices and to even kill people.
[00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:15.283]  But of course, that's a multi-billion dollar industry, medical devices, and it would not serve a lot of people's interest to have that information get out.
[00:08:16.104 --> 00:08:18.987]  He died just before the conference under mysterious circumstances.
[00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:28.375]  Now the mainstream media will cover the story of Edward Snowden and they'll kind of turn it into a Where's Waldo type of story, but it's about a lot more than that.
[00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:32.839]  Snowden's father calls out Obama on Nuremberg crimes.
[00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:43.515]  This is written by Bruce Fine and Snowden's father, and it says, These, I protest, are not mere second-class rights, but belong in the category of indispensable freedoms.
[00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:52.798]  Among deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual, and putting terror in every heart.
[00:08:53.499 --> 00:09:01.462]  Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government.
[00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:03.718]  That's what's going on, folks.
[00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:12.428]  This is how tyrants work, and this is why it is expressly forbidden in the Constitution, in the Fourth Amendment, and others.
[00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:22.599]  The types of things that we're seeing on a daily basis in many, many areas, but especially with this NSA story, with the dragnet that they're doing, they have to go before a judge
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:31.664]  And explain the reason why they are going to search someone, or search someone's things, or their papers, or their personal property, or their writings.
[00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:35.485]  That has to be put before a judge, and a judge has to agree.
[00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.887]  But instead they have done that to every American citizen.
[00:09:38.967 --> 00:09:41.748]  And it doesn't matter what degree they have done it to.
[00:09:42.028 --> 00:09:42.528]  They've done it.
[00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:43.769]  It breaks the law.
[00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:49.311]  Now the same people that broke the law are now asking that Edward Snowden be extradited out of Russia.
[00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:50.472]  And Russia says,
[00:09:51.232 --> 00:09:55.494]  That they've rejected out of hand Holder's extradition request for Snowden.
[00:09:56.354 --> 00:09:59.076]  And this is not just a partisan thing.
[00:09:59.616 --> 00:10:05.039]  This is something that former leaders of both parties have come out in opposition to this.
[00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:10.201]  Former President Jimmy Carter says, America now has no functioning democracy.
[00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:13.603]  And on the GOP side, former Senator
[00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:23.551]  Gordon Humphrey from New Hampshire wrote a very eloquent piece to Snowden himself and to The Guardian, which reported it.
[00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:28.695]  He said, I object to the monumentally disproportionate campaign being waged by the U.S.
[00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:42.726]  government against Edward Snowden while no effort is being made to identify, remove from office, and bring to justice those officials who have abused power seriously and repeatedly violating the Constitution of the U.S.
[00:10:42.907 --> 00:10:43.387]  and the rights
[00:10:43.407 --> 00:10:43.807]  We're good to go.
[00:11:13.198 --> 00:11:21.303]  It's incredible what we're seeing here in terms of ignoring the Constitution and breaking the law and allowing that to happen.
[00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:22.964]  They're not even concerned with that.
[00:11:23.244 --> 00:11:29.768]  They just want to make this about shutting down whistleblowers who are going to expose further criminal activity from them.
[00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:33.150]  Now we have a quote here from Henry David Thoreau.
[00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.553]  He says, Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty.
[00:11:37.273 --> 00:11:39.394]  The obedient must be slaves.
[00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:45.217]  Well, Thoreau was heavily quoted in that letter written by Bruce Fine to Obama and to Eric Holder.
[00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:53.180]  Now, coming up after the break, we have an interview with the grand prize winner from Operation Paul Revere, the $100,000 prize winner.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.101]  So stay tuned.
[00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.802]  We want to hear all about his film and how he made it and why.
[00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:06.424]  Now you can watch Alex Jones live at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:12:06.584 --> 00:12:11.686]  You'll find links to all of our content there and a free 15-day trial for Prison Planet TV.
[00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:19.968]  You can also browse the network, the Infowars Nightly News, and over 60 movies and documentaries all together in one place.
[00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:23.169]  You can watch the Alex Jones Radio Show live as it happens.
[00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:26.830]  So check it out, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:34.645]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:40.150]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:47.776]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:50.178]  From compulsory state education
[00:12:50.458 --> 00:12:57.323]  To the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:12:57.423 --> 00:13:04.388]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:13:04.608 --> 00:13:07.490]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:14.375]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:15.896]  Oh, there's another one.
[00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:17.238]  Another plane just hit.
[00:13:17.258 --> 00:13:18.079]  State of Mind.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.762]  Because there's a war on.
[00:13:19.922 --> 00:13:20.683]  For your mind.
[00:13:20.963 --> 00:13:24.969]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:30.236]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[00:13:34.332 --> 00:13:40.057]  Well, although three months is a very short time to do a film, it seems like it's been a long time reviewing these.
[00:13:40.137 --> 00:13:46.523]  I tell you, we've really been overwhelmed with both the quantity and the quality of the entries that came in.
[00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:52.588]  But there's one that stands out, and that's The Purge, the $100,000 grand prize winner.
[00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:56.031]  And I've got the filmmaker on the line with us right now.
[00:13:56.091 --> 00:13:57.292]  It's Michael Dorman.
[00:13:57.893 --> 00:13:59.114]  Michael, congratulations.
[00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.631]  Thank you so much.
[00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:06.214]  This has been so much fun from the very beginning all the way here to the announcement yesterday.
[00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:07.695]  It has been fabulous.
[00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:09.095]  That's great.
[00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:11.397]  Tell us how you found out about the Operation Paul Revere contest.
[00:14:11.997 --> 00:14:17.840]  Well, I'm a daily listener of Alex Jones, so obviously he announced it probably, what was it, back in January?
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.381]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:24.164]  So we started to get ideas about it then and started planning there on out.
[00:14:24.404 --> 00:14:24.944]  Super, super.
[00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:26.065]  So you decide you're going to get in it.
[00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:27.886]  What's the first thing you do when you're going to make a film?
[00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:35.244]  You gotta get the ideas together and so my brother has like a stack of different articles that he likes to collect and I do too.
[00:14:35.764 --> 00:14:44.426]  And so we started looking through those and you know at that time frame in January, February you had a lot of articles, you guys had a lot of articles about the DHS.
[00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:49.107]  And so you had the paper targets coming out then sometime around there.
[00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:54.188]  You had the tanks being announced, the 2700
[00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.469]  That's right.
[00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:13.131]  Yeah, and that's the key.
[00:15:13.151 --> 00:15:24.584]  I've got to tell you, there were so many fine entries, production values very good, and they were also on Target, and they covered a variety of topics, and that was a really important thing, too, about Operation Paul Revere.
[00:15:24.604 --> 00:15:26.185]  But, you know, it's just like
[00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:33.329]  When Alex saw that, it just hit home because he's been talking for so long about how they're holding these meetings.
[00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:34.490]  I mean, this goes way back.
[00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.151]  They've been doing this type of thing for a very long time.
[00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.492]  We've been talking about it for a very long time.
[00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:53.479]  And when you acted it out, when he saw your film production, your dramatization of what's actually going on in these meetings that we've been talking about, we've been showing the notes from the meetings, we've been showing even some clips from the meetings when you actually acted this out.
[00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:55.500]  That really hit home with him.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.460]  That's what pushed it over the top, I believe.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.742]  Yeah, you even showed the video of the DHS guy.
[00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:01.882]  What was it in the meeting?
[00:16:02.082 --> 00:16:04.743]  Yeah, George Washington is the terrorist.
[00:16:05.143 --> 00:16:07.744]  And so you see that, oh, we've got to do a movie about this.
[00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:08.644]  That's great.
[00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:11.265]  Well, tell us what you're going to do with the money now.
[00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:21.662]  I'm getting a little low on the tangy tangerine, so I think I'm going to hit the InfoWars website store and get a little bit of the tangy tangerine too.
[00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:22.522]  That's great.
[00:16:22.823 --> 00:16:27.086]  Get a copy of, what's your new video?
[00:16:27.126 --> 00:16:28.267]  The State of Mind.
[00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:28.988]  State of Mind, yeah.
[00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:29.808]  I haven't seen that yet.
[00:16:29.848 --> 00:16:30.549]  I got to get that.
[00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.492]  Probably get, say, Infidel Body Armor.
[00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:35.253]  Look good.
[00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:38.736]  I don't have a Pro1 Propeller yet, so I'll probably get one of those.
[00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:45.000]  I tell you what, that Infidel body armor, I keep seeing these unannounced no-knock SWAT raids, and it's like, man, they could break in on anything.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.642]  They don't have to have a reason, they just break in and start shooting if they think you're suspicious.
[00:16:48.702 --> 00:16:50.943]  I mean, it's almost like everybody should have that.
[00:16:50.983 --> 00:16:51.744]  It's about the only way.
[00:16:52.004 --> 00:16:58.788]  You know, you can't get them to get the fluoride out of the water, you can't get them to get the cops under control, but at least you can get a filter and get body armors about anything.
[00:16:58.808 --> 00:16:59.428]  You never know.
[00:16:59.749 --> 00:17:00.209]  That's right.
[00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:00.629]  You never know.
[00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:02.630]  Well, what are you going to do with the film projects now?
[00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:05.172]  What's next up on your slate for films?
[00:17:05.732 --> 00:17:06.953]  Have you got something under production now?
[00:17:07.438 --> 00:17:09.359]  No, I don't have anything on a production now.
[00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:20.046]  I do want to talk to you guys because I would love to investigate this more as far as, you know, let's look at other corruption that we could really get into their offices.
[00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:28.612]  We can really get into their mindset and see the discussions between the White House and the Illuminati, the DHS, the NSA.
[00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:29.932]  What are they really talking about?
[00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:31.834]  So I'd love to do a full
[00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:33.515]  We're good.
[00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:55.945]  She's got a breaking report about Obama and the connection with the Obamaphone and the telecom billionaire out of Mexico, the world's richest man.
[00:17:56.005 --> 00:18:01.710]  So, you know, we talk about the presidents being just puppets of international globalist corporations.
[00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.733]  I mean... So we see that conversation.
[00:18:05.773 --> 00:18:07.675]  That's the kind of narrative I'd like to get into.
[00:18:07.695 --> 00:18:08.596]  That's what we did with Purge.
[00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.957]  And people seem to like it.
[00:18:09.997 --> 00:18:10.938]  So let's go further.
[00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:11.498]  That's right.
[00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.940]  You know, we tell people about what's happening in the news.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.323]  We can put together documentaries that spread it out and give them a broader context.
[00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:20.165]  But those are all didactic.
[00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:27.370]  And it seems like when you act out something and people can see that interaction, then it really clicks in a different way.
[00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.811]  It wakes them up in a different way.
[00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:34.095]  And then they're ready to go back and explore farther with the documentaries, with the news articles.
[00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:37.138]  But it's really got to click with them on a visceral level.
[00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:42.602]  And I think that's what your film and other films that people have acted this stuff out, I think that's what's really important about that.
[00:18:42.983 --> 00:18:44.844]  Yeah, and look at what The Enemy is doing.
[00:18:44.964 --> 00:18:48.467]  Now we got a TV series on Hillary Clinton is coming out.
[00:18:48.687 --> 00:18:50.008]  Why are they doing that?
[00:18:50.068 --> 00:18:51.870]  Well, it's for the reasons you just stated.
[00:18:52.315 --> 00:19:00.119]  Well, you mentioned that, and there's a breaking news story that was on The Hollywood Reporter about the chilling history of how Hollywood helped Hitler.
[00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:02.320]  And Alex talked about this a little bit yesterday.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.861]  It's really amazing.
[00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:06.142]  It says, drawing on archival documents in the U.S.
[00:19:06.182 --> 00:19:15.687]  and Germany, he reveals the shocking extent in this book to which Hollywood cooperated and collaborated with the Nazis during the decade leading up to World War II to protect its business.
[00:19:15.968 --> 00:19:18.169]  And they point out they didn't do any critical
[00:19:18.849 --> 00:19:19.430]  We're good to go.
[00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:36.549]  Absolutely.
[00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:42.037]  And if we're going to be in the Infowar, then we've got to be offensive with film.
[00:19:42.378 --> 00:19:44.240]  And you guys have done a great job.
[00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:47.045]  You're encouraging the rest of us Infowarriors to get involved.
[00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:49.729]  And I believe there's a lot of things we could do.
[00:19:50.452 --> 00:19:55.016]  Well, tell us a little bit about yourself, your background in filmmaking, your movie company.
[00:19:55.036 --> 00:19:58.119]  I know you've got a film I saw on Amazon, Renegade.
[00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:00.941]  It's a PG Western, and I liked the film reviews there.
[00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:02.403]  There's a couple of Amazon reviews.
[00:20:02.683 --> 00:20:08.368]  This one said it's true grit meets lonesome dove, fun for the whole family, great message, superb score, quality acting.
[00:20:08.388 --> 00:20:10.750]  Another one said great faith-based film for families.
[00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.732]  Tell us a little bit about that and some of your other work.
[00:20:13.223 --> 00:20:15.165]  Yeah, well, I'm originally from Tucson, Arizona.
[00:20:15.185 --> 00:20:16.086]  That's where I am now.
[00:20:16.106 --> 00:20:17.487]  That's where the film company is now.
[00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:22.111]  And yeah, I got going into film back in 2003.
[00:20:22.151 --> 00:20:28.978]  My first short film was about the devil and a day that you see in the devil kind of like the satire guy you guys have done.
[00:20:28.998 --> 00:20:33.222]  So I really should show some clips of that for you sometime.
[00:20:33.262 --> 00:20:38.106]  But that was kind of my first and then I probably done 15 or so short movies.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.060]  about that.
[00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:54.030]  Oh, all kinds of ones.
[00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.591]  You mentioned the film about the devil.
[00:20:55.791 --> 00:20:57.973]  We took a lot of heat from that from a lot of people.
[00:20:58.433 --> 00:21:00.354]  I kind of wonder if C.S.
[00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:03.256]  Lewis got heat for doing screw-type hunters from people.
[00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:04.997]  Oh, I'm sure, but it's powerful.
[00:21:05.177 --> 00:21:13.383]  I mean, when you start to see what is the devil really talking about with his demons and such, and then why does he do what he does?
[00:21:13.543 --> 00:21:14.904]  Why is he so hateful?
[00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:16.425]  Where did that come from?
[00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:18.546]  And so I would love to do a feature film
[00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:28.094]  It would take a lot of money to do, but where you actually see the devil in heaven, and then you see the fall, and then you see why he is why he is, what is he really after here on earth?
[00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:29.015]  Right.
[00:21:29.115 --> 00:21:31.957]  Is it just because he said, no, no, no, there's a reason to it all.
[00:21:32.437 --> 00:21:35.340]  So, you know, I think it's a powerful piece if we could do it.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.704]  Renegade, yeah, it's a family film about a movie about God, gold, and guns.
[00:21:41.164 --> 00:21:44.286]  The tagline is, the good and the bad shall be revealed.
[00:21:44.967 --> 00:21:47.749]  And yeah, go on chosenfilmworks.com.
[00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:48.629]  That's my website.
[00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:49.450]  You can buy it through that.
[00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.471]  And it's on Amazon, too.
[00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:54.654]  But yeah, I think your audience would really enjoy it.
[00:21:54.674 --> 00:21:55.454]  That's great.
[00:21:56.015 --> 00:22:01.038]  So, I forget, did you say that you're already working on another film right now?
[00:22:01.098 --> 00:22:02.860]  Or do you have an active project that's going on?
[00:22:03.504 --> 00:22:07.246]  No, I got a lot of different things in development I'd like to get going.
[00:22:07.266 --> 00:22:09.447]  So no, I'm not working on anything officially right now.
[00:22:09.467 --> 00:22:10.808]  I have a comedy that I'd like to do.
[00:22:10.848 --> 00:22:15.310]  I like the movie about the devil, but now would be a good time.
[00:22:15.351 --> 00:22:18.692]  And I really feel we are at a critical, critical time in history.
[00:22:18.732 --> 00:22:23.275]  If we're going to do this, if we're going to really ante up and come after the globalists,
[00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:24.815]  Yeah, get on the offensive.
[00:22:24.835 --> 00:22:25.296]  Now's the time.
[00:22:25.496 --> 00:22:28.337]  So if we're going to do it, we've got to start talking and planning here this fall.
[00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:39.853]  That's right, yeah.
[00:22:40.013 --> 00:22:41.554]  And that's basically the time frame we're looking at.
[00:22:41.594 --> 00:22:47.257]  Right now, we've got a documentary that's under production, and it's after that that Alex is going to start rolling these things out.
[00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:53.301]  And that was one of the key things that we needed to do, was to be able to turn around things that were very, on a very short time basis.
[00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:57.863]  Tell us about some of the other films that were in Paul Revere that maybe you liked, some of your competition.
[00:22:58.123 --> 00:22:58.824]  What stood out to you?
[00:22:59.957 --> 00:23:01.659]  A Healthy Distrust was awesome.
[00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:02.680]  Great interviews.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.023]  They had great information that they passed along.
[00:23:06.805 --> 00:23:09.167]  Dream Revered was fantastic.
[00:23:09.207 --> 00:23:12.891]  Yeah, that was almost, you know, that was really kind of in our top four.
[00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:18.056]  You know, I mean, it was very difficult as to, you know, what to put for the third place winner.
[00:23:18.096 --> 00:23:19.217]  It was really, really close.
[00:23:19.237 --> 00:23:20.919]  That was an excellent documentary.
[00:23:20.939 --> 00:23:21.540]  I really liked that.
[00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:25.314]  Look at American Drone, that might as well be on network TV.
[00:23:25.334 --> 00:23:27.317]  There was Endgame, the production value.
[00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:33.932]  We're good to go.
[00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:55.556]  Film festivals, and they all rejected it because of subject matter.
[00:23:55.596 --> 00:23:57.356]  They don't want to talk about that, right?
[00:23:57.697 --> 00:24:01.558]  So there's a self-censorship that's going on, even if it isn't coming from the top.
[00:24:01.598 --> 00:24:04.540]  They don't want to get into certain types of controversies.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:20.107]  They have no trouble jumping into other types of controversies, but when it comes to really looking at what happened on September 11th, which is fundamental to the way, you know, this country has been transformed on the basis of the official narrative of 9-11.
[00:24:21.307 --> 00:24:33.498]  So that's something we should all look at very carefully just as we should all look at very carefully the official rationale for transforming the world based on the perception of climate change and the causes, the perceived causes of climate change or whatever.
[00:24:33.878 --> 00:24:46.950]  So they come up with these narratives and they use these narratives to completely restructure society and government and even create a world government and yet we're not allowed to question or even look at these fundamental assumptions.
[00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:53.725]  Yeah, but you know, just take it one brick at a time, build it up, build it up.
[00:24:53.925 --> 00:25:10.440]  One of my favorite books is Oleg Mandino's The Greatest Salesman in the World, and it talks about if you're going to be a success at anything, you just have to, you know, you may take, if you're going to chop down a tree and you got your axe, the first blow may not cause even a tremor in the wood, but from childhood swipes, if you just keep on it,
[00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:13.522]  Keep on going, the oak will eventually tumble.
[00:25:13.863 --> 00:25:19.947]  It's like anything, you just gotta just keep going, keep going, keep going, and then hopefully you hit those points of critical mass.
[00:25:20.788 --> 00:25:25.351]  Especially in the Infowar, where things do begin to snap.
[00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:26.752]  What was it?
[00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:31.356]  Summer 2012, HSBC or something admitted that they laundered the money for it?
[00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:31.856]  Yeah.
[00:25:46.613 --> 00:25:49.274]  Well, you have situations like the Snowden case, for example, right now.
[00:25:49.774 --> 00:25:56.035]  There were whistleblowers right after September 11th that talked about precisely what he's talking about, the dragnet that went out there.
[00:25:56.095 --> 00:25:57.516]  These were people who were on the inside.
[00:25:57.576 --> 00:25:59.336]  They went through the entire internal process.
[00:25:59.896 --> 00:26:01.296]  Then they went open with it.
[00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:02.637]  The government came after them.
[00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:07.338]  But it took Edward Snowden leaking the same information that these insiders had been
[00:26:07.938 --> 00:26:08.178]  I think so.
[00:26:28.084 --> 00:26:29.445]  And you did a great job.
[00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:44.598]  I know you're very happy winning and we just want to tell the other people who participate in this that we're going to be looking at all of their work and it's a talent search as part of this and we had a lot of really fine work out there but we're interested in talking to you some more and you'll be hearing back from us I'm sure.
[00:26:45.518 --> 00:26:46.739]  All praise and glory to God.
[00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:47.580]  Thank you so much.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.601]  It was wonderful.
[00:26:49.241 --> 00:26:50.743]  All my people involved, thank you.
[00:26:50.763 --> 00:26:56.328]  They're so excited, so proud, and hopefully we can do an annual event.
[00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.830]  Yeah, I love it.
[00:26:59.170 --> 00:26:59.751]  Thank you very much.
[00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:01.272]  Congratulations, Michael.
[00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:10.460]  Well, congratulations to Michael Dorman, the producer of The Purge, the $100,000 grand prize winner in Operation Paul Revere.
[00:27:11.414 --> 00:27:12.735]  And we want you to go check that out.
[00:27:12.755 --> 00:27:17.038]  We didn't play any clips of it, so we want you to go check that out at Operation Paul Revere site.
[00:27:17.078 --> 00:27:19.920]  That's InfoWars.com forward slash Paul.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.061]  And you can see all the entries there.
[00:27:22.542 --> 00:27:25.884]  Not just the finalists, not just the winners, but there's a lot of stuff there.
[00:27:25.964 --> 00:27:29.526]  And you're all winners for participating in it, and we're serious about that.
[00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:30.467]  You've had an effect.
[00:27:32.403 --> 00:27:51.298]  Communication from one of the finalists saying that he had tried for years to wake up his family and once he became a finalist he got his mom to go take a look at the movies at the site and she was up till late in the morning looking at all these different films and it really woke her up on a variety of topics.
[00:27:51.934 --> 00:27:56.435]  So it's a great outreach, and we want you to use that as a resource.
[00:27:56.935 --> 00:27:59.815]  I think you'll be entertained, and it's a great way to wake people up.
[00:28:00.215 --> 00:28:03.916]  We're going to try to do the things that the mainstream media and that Hollywood won't do.
[00:28:03.976 --> 00:28:10.777]  As we talked about in the interview, Hollywood was actually helping the Germans as Hitler rose to power.
[00:28:11.377 --> 00:28:14.338]  And we see the same sort of thing happening in Washington now.
[00:28:14.378 --> 00:28:20.259]  They're working hand in glove with the government, working to establish new boundaries for society.
[00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:26.693]  Working to establish an authoritarian centralized government and we need to push back against that in every way possible.
[00:28:27.093 --> 00:28:31.456]  Now the new edition of InfoWars Magazine just came out.
[00:28:31.736 --> 00:28:33.437]  That's another way that you can reach people.
[00:28:33.517 --> 00:28:35.659]  It's another way that we're committed to get the information out.
[00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:39.201]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:39.602 --> 00:28:43.724]  You can support all of our operations there and help us to fund this operation.
[00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:45.986]  Help us to do things like Operation Paul Revere.
[00:28:46.852 --> 00:28:49.894]  It was a huge amount of money for a video contest.
[00:28:50.394 --> 00:28:58.660]  There are not very many contests out there that have a $100,000 prize, and we can do that with your support, with your purchases at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.820]  It's a win-win situation.
[00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:05.924]  It helps us to get the information out there, and Alex is committed to funding this information war.
[00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:07.305]  Well, that's it for tonight.
[00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.727]  We'll be back at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[00:29:09.827 --> 00:29:10.748]  Eastern, tomorrow night.
[00:29:10.788 --> 00:29:11.288]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:22.536]  Now you can watch the Alex Jones Show live as it happens at InfoWars.com slash show.
