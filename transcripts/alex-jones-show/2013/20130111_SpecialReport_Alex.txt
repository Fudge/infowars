[00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:12.040]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.124]  We're here at the Texas Capitol to ask people how they feel about gun control.
[00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:29.896]  I'm here to not only talk about voting no on some of the legislation that is loosening up registration and re-registration of gun owners, but more importantly to ban assault weapons.
[00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:32.078]  An assault weapon is
[00:00:32.853 --> 00:00:40.017]  A weapon full automatic is allowed only the military and police.
[00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:47.161]  It's only for the military and police and for a special trust where you can get where you can buy a class-free weapon.
[00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:54.246]  I don't think that taking away a person's right to bear arms is the answer but I do believe that there should be restrictions.
[00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:59.829]  I have a clean record so technically I could go to a gun show and purchase as many guns as I want to
[00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:01.290]  Have them in my house.
[00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.671]  I have a four-year-old daughter.
[00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:04.792]  Why should I have an assault rifle?
[00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:06.393]  A gun show, a shooting range.
[00:01:06.413 --> 00:01:07.934]  You never see mass shootings there.
[00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:11.317]  There's all kinds of ammo and guns and people walking all around them.
[00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:13.698]  Yeah, I don't support the assault weapon ban.
[00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.762]  What I do believe is a good alternative would be like my colleague here mentioned is a
[00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.312]  Stronger restrictions when it comes to evaluating the people's mental health.
[00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:26.093]  Psychiatrist exam or something.
[00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:30.997]  Now what about in China where a gentleman, I believe is around the same time, slashed 20 children with a knife?
[00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:33.018]  What do you say to people who may bring that up?
[00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:46.527]  Well, I can tell you that I'm a citizen of America and in America we're a civilized people and as civilized people we need to set our own rules in place to govern our country.
[00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:50.773]  What do you say to people who say, well, maybe the Sandy Hook guy had a gun, but this guy had a knife?
[00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.538]  A person with a knife is a lot easier to subdue.
[00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:56.904]  What do you think about gun-free zones at schools?
[00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.689]  Free massacre zone!
[00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:02.256]  You know, say the principal had a gun in her office.
[00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:06.359]  Would she have had time to even pull it out, take off the safety and use it?
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.702]  And to that extent, so I don't think that's a good argument.
[00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.204]  How long did they have to wait until someone got there to stop this guy?
[00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:18.789]  Because no one in this quote unquote safe school zone or no gun zone was there to defend the children.
[00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.534]  Obama's kids, they go to a school with 11 guards.
[00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:28.938]  Now besides assault weapons, are you for any other type of legislation such as
[00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.762]  Yes, but I think the core of it is to get rid of the weapons.
[00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:42.845]  You know, it's just another incremental step.
[00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.546]  I mean, okay, is it ten rounds today?
[00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:46.347]  Is it five rounds next week?
[00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:51.511]  One of the alternatives I really, really would push for would be raising the price on bullets.
[00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.213]  Raising the price on bullets, raising the taxes on bullets.
[00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:59.257]  Okay, you realize that a deer rifle or an AR-15 are basically the same thing, just one looks spookier than the other?
[00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:03.340]  Well, it should be a weapon that shoots one bullet at a time.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.963]  The federal government recently just spent, you know, just purchased $1.6 billion.
[00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:09.385]  I believe it was in the past calendar year.
[00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:13.722]  Well, if it's the federal government purchasing it, then it's probably going to go to our law enforcement.
[00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:17.066]  And I think that's something that our law enforcement people need.
[00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:23.754]  Not too long ago, the Empire State Building, where the police opened fire on one guy and hit eight or nine other people who were not their intended target.
[00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:25.997]  So, what do you say to that?
[00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.131]  Well, I mean, we can have no comment on that.
[00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.992]  Don't you want to defend yourself against tyranny?
[00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:34.772]  Yes, sir, I do.
[00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:40.914]  Somebody that wants you put down like this, wants to make you a slave, isn't that the freedom of the Second Amendment?
[00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:45.035]  No, as far as the Second Amendment, it has the right to a well-regulated militia.
[00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:48.337]  Do you think a well-regulated militia could use something like assault weapons?
[00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:51.357]  And the Second Amendment is the right to bear arms.
[00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:52.618]  And it also has for
[00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.986]  A well-regulated militia, that's also in there as well, miss.
[00:03:56.046 --> 00:04:01.430]  Well, it's our military is our militia, not our common everyday citizens.
[00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:09.117]  Now, sir, there are people out there that say, why do you need a semi-automatic rifle such as the one allegedly used in the Sandy Hook shooting?
[00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:12.100]  Well, just once again, it's not about my need.
[00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:13.862]  It's about my right.
[00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:20.768]  Miss, if I can ask you a question, talking about the blood of children on our hands, the Obama administration, and it went back to Bush as well,
[00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.270]  I'm not going to comment on that.
[00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.911]  When seconds count, police are only minutes away.
[00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.991]  And I carry a 1911 because policemen's too heavy.
