[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.230]  Just came on cable access and hung out, or what your actual employment was?
[00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.090]  I come on public access and hang out.
[00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.111]  I'm on 24 hours a day, they say.
[00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:09.571]  Yeah, pretty close.
[00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.252]  Well, I can assure you I don't make any money off public access.
[00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:14.832]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:15.993]  Well, you guys have a good one.
[00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:18.213]  Hey, appreciate that call.
[00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:18.733]  Hello, Cole.
[00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.174]  Are you on the air?
[00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:20.614]  Yes, Alex.
[00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:21.374]  How you doing?
[00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:21.874]  Pretty good.
[00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:25.075]  I was just kind of curious if it's true that
[00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:40.344]  The police can have laser or infrared beams, if you want to call it, and they can project those into your house to basically... Yeah, the Austin Police Department, last time I heard, has 20 units with infrared.
[00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:44.307]  If you have enough of a heat source in your house, it'll pick up the heat source and show a signature.
[00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:46.048]  It's called FLIR.
[00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:47.569]  It's infrared or heat signature.
[00:00:49.785 --> 00:01:04.570]  And we didn't play all of the cut from the Lear News Hour, but it says, yes, black helicopters are being used for surveillance of the public by sheriff's departments and police departments around the country.
[00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:16.328]  So, that's real, and I'm going to play that tomorrow night from 8.30 on past 10 on my AXIS television show that's actually my show proper, just as an entertainment show.
[00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:33.777]  And I'm going to have a tax expert on, so you'll see the Laird News Hour, short little cut for news reasons, that'll show you Laird News Hour saying, yeah, here's the black helicopters, the military has sold them to the police departments all over the country, they've got thousands of them, they've got thousands of tanks and armored personnel carriers now, and
[00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:42.057]  They don't say, by the way, all these people that have been kooks for 10 years telling you about it, now they're admitting they have black helicopters.
[00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:42.579]  It's a fact!
