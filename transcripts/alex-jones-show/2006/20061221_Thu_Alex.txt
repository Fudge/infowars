[00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:06.094]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:07.815]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:09.676]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.097]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:12.718]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.703]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:41.838]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:51.323]  Welcome to all of you listening across the United States and worldwide, as well as the ships at sea, our military forces in foreign lands.
[00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:52.664]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:54.292 --> 00:01:05.536]  Now already on this Thursday edition, the 21st day of December 2006, I'm going to attempt to control myself today and take a lot of your phone calls in the first hour and a half.
[00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:14.900]  Then we are scheduled to have one of the main anthropologists live in studio who worked on the film Apocalypto with Mel Gibson.
[00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:31.970]  And it'll be the last time I talk about Apocalypto at any length, but I interviewed her Sunday, and it was just amazing, but in the hour we had, only 40 minutes of that radio time on the new Sunday show I do, we were unable to get into all the facets I wanted to cover.
[00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.691]  And it's not just about Apocalypto, or the Aztecs, or the Mayans.
[00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:46.293]  It's about the mindset of the professors, the anthropologists at major universities that came out and said that human sacrifice is, quote, valid,
[00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.653]  That it is something that is basically good.
[00:01:51.673 --> 00:02:03.362]  I have the quotes here, and this is the attitude out of what I guess you'd call the mainline left, that every culture is good but Western culture.
[00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:10.807]  Well, I think every culture is independent of itself, but basically similar in that we have a blood lust.
[00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:17.311]  There is a wish for carnage and destruction and bloodletting.
[00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.575]  It doesn't matter if you're an Asian.
[00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:37.563]  in Mesoamerica, and that's what those folks are and were, or whether you are a Germanic tribe in the hills of Deutschland, or if you are a Druid in England, or the Romans with their form of human sacrifice in the arena.
[00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:41.684]  Why does this run through the course of human history?
[00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:49.066]  We'll be talking to a preeminent anthropologist on this subject who speaks fluent ancient Mayan
[00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:58.448]  And she'll be in the studio with us, and she'll also talk about some of her interactions with Mel Gibson in the post-production of the film.
[00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.349]  But that is in the second half.
[00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.271]  In the first half, any news story, any item, any question, any comment, you've got.
[00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:08.372]  You're welcome.
[00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:09.592]  We don't string your calls.
[00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:12.573]  You can come on board with us anytime you wish at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:14.854]  I want to first, after the break, get into the Iraq War some.
[00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:20.976]  I'm sure you've already heard.
[00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:24.340]  Now they want $99.7 billion.
[00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:29.787]  They want almost $100 billion in supplemental spending package.
[00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.693]  That will be $170 billion allotted for the war next year alone.
[00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:35.814]  Just for the war.
[00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:51.144]  We now have a defense budget that in the last six years has ballooned from $500 billion to $800 plus billion dollars a year.
[00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:56.805]  Now when you hear on the news, you'll hear that the main spending is $600 billion.
[00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:07.007]  But then when you add in all the other supplementals, we are getting very, very close to $1 trillion dollars a year.
[00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:21.180]  One trillion dollars a year, and of course, most of that goes into no-bid contracts and scams, and the final juice is being sucked out of the country.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.383]  The New World Order spider is basically finishing off our innards.
[00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:34.649]  My main goal is that when the Depression comes, when the massive crash comes, the globalists will be dancing around, posing as your saviors yet again,
[00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:40.736]  I want you at that point to at least know your enemy and know who did it to you.
[00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:43.357]  They've already knocked us over, okay?
[00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.958]  They've already hit us and hit us hard.
[00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:59.182]  But most Americans are delusional and don't know that, so we're here so that as things become more apparent to you, you will then become completely enraged and join us in the fight against the new world order.
[00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.709]  It's here!
[00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.713]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:17.759]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.485]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:32.790]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.288]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:41.149]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.490]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.751]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:05.869]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.254]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:24.022]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:28.785]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:34.048]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.191]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:47.237]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:01.167]  It's a fact.
[00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:05.790]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:11.435]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:14.937]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[00:07:15.177 --> 00:07:22.303]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:29.845]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:32.106]  We also do credit restoration.
[00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:38.828]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:07:39.128 --> 00:07:42.929]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:45.830]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.690]  to 5 p.m.
[00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.251]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:49.731]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.752]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.585]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:24.882]  Modern mainline so-called conservative talk radio is there to neutralize conservatives
[00:08:25.723 --> 00:08:34.955]  To control your political energies and ensure that you don't get in the way of America going into receivership to the global crime syndicate.
[00:08:36.257 --> 00:08:42.265]  And I was driving into the work this morning and doing a few errands around town so I listened to talk radio about 30 minutes.
[00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:49.786]  And I heard two different national talk show hosts, as I was skipping around on the dial, saying, you're going to love this!
[00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:50.486]  Get ready!
[00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:52.326]  You're going to love this!
[00:08:52.907 --> 00:09:00.188]  And then they would come back with some horrible news about what they call liberals, you know, what they're out doing to the country.
[00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.149]  You see, we don't love it.
[00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:05.650]  We don't say, you're going to love this!
[00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:10.868]  Like we get all excited and upset about it, but they never give you any solutions.
[00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:12.050]  That's what they do.
[00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.372]  We try to give you solutions.
[00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:16.697]  It just makes me so sick.
[00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:41.501]  Or, while they've got you all horrified of Kwanzaa, which wouldn't even get any traction if they didn't give it so much attention, or while they've got you worried about the boogeymen that the Muslims are going to get you, they say nothing about how the government, both Republican and Democrat, are doing everything they can to get rid of our borders and bring in unlimited amounts of third world populations from every corner of the globe.
[00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:47.400]  And I started the show with this yesterday and I'm going to do it again.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.543]  I was on a national talk show with Lars Larson and he was defending the North American Union now.
[00:09:55.103 --> 00:10:08.068]  I'm a liberal conspiracy theorist because I'm against it and it's for the security of America and it's free market and let's just hand our infrastructure over to foreign companies.
[00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:11.870]  Of course it wasn't selling
[00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:16.752]  Every caller that called in while I was on agreed.
[00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:27.836]  They couldn't find callers that disagreed with me, so they just stopped going to calls, and then later in the show, the callers all agreed with me after I was gone.
[00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:35.639]  And that's because we've actually won the fight for the hearts and minds of the American people.
[00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:42.946]  I mean, I could start the show today with the fact that the Pentagon wants a supplemental funding of $99.7 trillion.
[00:10:42.966 --> 00:10:43.166]  $99.7 trillion.
[00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:43.766]  Excuse me, $99.7 billion.
[00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:44.867]  That's $99,700,000,000 added to what they're doing.
[00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:16.953]  And we can talk about how the war's wrong and how it's designed to give America a bad name, how we're being used by the globalists to do their dirty work.
[00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:18.613]  We can talk about that all day long.
[00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.074]  But what's the point?
[00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:33.417]  In major polls, it's almost 80 percent, I keep saying 70 percent, it's almost 80 percent that want the war to end, that want our
[00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:34.901]  We're good to go.
[00:11:53.951 --> 00:12:09.180]  So actually, we call the American people dumb, to a certain extent they're not dumb, they're just not totally informed, and they know the war is a fraud, they know we were lied to war, they know it's bad for the troops, they know the CIA assessment states that our troops being there makes it worse.
[00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:14.183]  So why should I sit here and address the 22-23% of Americans?
[00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:30.224]  Or the 30% of the troops that want to stay in a foreign land so defense contractors can make a bunch of money and so the oil won't flow so the oil companies can try to keep the price of oil high.
[00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:43.227]  Because I was all ready to go on the air and, you know, give an impassioned diatribe against the war and go over the evidences, but the people know a lot of the evidence.
[00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:44.487]  They know it's a bad war.
[00:12:46.801 --> 00:13:06.676]  So really the only illusion there is in the delusional 22-23 percent who are listening out there who don't care what the American people want, don't care what the Constitution says, don't care if we were lied to war, for them they've got to have quote, victory!
[00:13:08.658 --> 00:13:12.561]  It's a ego thing and you can tell them,
[00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:16.122]  Here's the Pentagon plan.
[00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:17.323]  Here's the Israeli plan.
[00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:18.984]  They plan to stay there decades.
[00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:20.706]  Victory is not what they wanted.
[00:13:20.886 --> 00:13:28.272]  They could have gone in, kept the police apparatus in place, and left in just six months.
[00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:30.313]  They could have gotten the water and power on.
[00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:31.654]  The generals weren't allowed to.
[00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:39.281]  Our government has been caught with its agents staging bombing attacks on the British, the U.S., and the Israelis to stir up sectarian violence.
[00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:43.264]  Do you understand it's a meat grinder into which our troops are being crammed?
[00:13:44.952 --> 00:13:48.573]  What you call victory isn't going to be allowed.
[00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:56.317]  And they still look at you and go, well I heard you say all this was going to happen, and you're right about it.
[00:13:56.618 --> 00:14:00.600]  A lot of these conservatives, if they want to be called conservatives, fine, you're a conservative.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.503]  I call you phony conservatives, brainwashed conservatives, mixed up conservatives.
[00:14:08.203 --> 00:14:10.645]  I mean, there's not one of you out there that can say I was wrong.
[00:14:10.685 --> 00:14:11.966]  I told you exactly what would happen.
[00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:12.667]  It wasn't hard.
[00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:14.689]  It was an official battle plan.
[00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:18.192]  Again, it wasn't hard.
[00:14:18.412 --> 00:14:21.215]  Just read what the CFR and the New World Order said was going to happen.
[00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:23.337]  Just read what the Pentagon said the plan was.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.363]  But in the final equation, it doesn't matter if this is a republic.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.841]  And this is a nation of laws.
[00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:35.023]  The Congress never voted for the war.
[00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:37.024]  The Congress never declared war.
[00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:43.830]  And I hear these neocons on talk radio saying, how dare congressmen go on fact-finding missions to the Middle East?
[00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.513]  How dare congressmen question the war?
[00:14:47.613 --> 00:14:48.573]  We're in a war.
[00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:51.816]  You've got to support the executive and not question him.
[00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:52.677]  What?
[00:14:53.217 --> 00:14:54.878]  Congress levies war.
[00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:56.980]  Congress prescribes war.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.282]  Congress writes up a declaration.
[00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:20.303]  But no, that's why they don't declare wars anymore, and they've gone from 50 years ago, every American knew the President prosecuted a war, and did what Congress said, executed the war, till today, even most liberals think you're not supposed to question the President, or that he's the one that wages war.
[00:15:21.764 --> 00:15:24.646]  He's the guy that decides how the war is going to be run.
[00:15:25.407 --> 00:15:28.529]  That's why there's an Armed Services Committee in the House and Senate.
[00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:29.370]  They
[00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:34.721]  Make the decisions and the President executes them!
[00:15:35.161 --> 00:15:37.143]  Now go read the Constitution!
[00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.644]  Go read the subsections!
[00:15:38.864 --> 00:15:40.265]  We've read them here on air before.
[00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:53.815]  So you got 78% of Americans in major polls, 78 or 77 depending on which poll, scientific polls against the war,
[00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:57.097]  The troops, seventy percent, want to come home.
[00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:03.219]  The government's own assessments, that they don't like to publicize, but our public, say our troops being there makes it worse.
[00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:18.103]  Pentagon battle plan saying, break it in three parts, sectarian war, build permanent bases, de-industrialize, spread civil war into the entire region, get the Arabs all killing each other, and it's working like a charm.
[00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:20.784]  People say Bush has failed, the war is a disaster,
[00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:24.820]  Well, it's a disaster for you when your son doesn't come home.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.022]  It's a disaster for you when your son's going to get lung cancer from DU.
[00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:34.504]  And you're sitting there, you'll probably finally wake up then when his guts are pouring out on those sheets.
[00:16:38.505 --> 00:16:39.386]  Out there, out there.
[00:16:40.686 --> 00:16:41.346]  Orifices.
[00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:45.708]  You'll finally, finally hit your knees and throw up.
[00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:50.956]  And repent to God for the fraud that you've helped empower.
[00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:52.938]  Support the troops.
[00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:54.139]  Victory!
[00:16:56.481 --> 00:17:13.414]  When the government said from the start, victory was decades of war, never leaving, millions of dead Iraqis, 654,000 in the last three and a half years, that's victory.
[00:17:13.614 --> 00:17:15.716]  And America demonized worldwide
[00:17:17.722 --> 00:17:21.305]  The biggest media owner in the world, news-wise, is News Corp.
[00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:27.531]  Their newspapers, their television stations demonize America from Australia to Germany to England.
[00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:33.055]  But here domestically, it's so two-sided, folks.
[00:17:34.376 --> 00:17:39.161]  We, the American people, have gone from the most loved to the most hated by design.
[00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:42.123]  The very same globalists tried this with the Vietnam War.
[00:17:43.044 --> 00:17:44.345]  Fifteen-year war from 1960
[00:17:46.194 --> 00:17:53.482]  To 1975, officially kicked off, but still no declaration, in 1964 with another staged event, Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:17:56.565 --> 00:18:02.211]  And so even those of you out there that support the war, do you support the will of the American people?
[00:18:03.032 --> 00:18:04.714]  Almost 80% are against it.
[00:18:06.296 --> 00:18:07.477]  The troops are against it.
[00:18:08.385 --> 00:18:12.428]  The troops have been ordered to re-up repeatedly with stop-loss.
[00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:15.731]  They're being drafted, as you deny there's even a draft.
[00:18:17.232 --> 00:18:21.576]  They're being used like birdcage liner and toilet paper by the globalists.
[00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:26.660]  So do you have any respect even for the American people?
[00:18:27.321 --> 00:18:28.101]  No, no, no.
[00:18:28.142 --> 00:18:29.683]  It's like a football game for you.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.264]  No, we've got to win, and then the government can't even tell you what winning is.
[00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:38.646]  But if you want to go read what their actual... It's like the drug war.
[00:18:39.087 --> 00:18:46.052]  The cops will tell you, well yeah, there's more drugs than ever, and more people in prison, and more problems, but we're going to win this war.
[00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:47.974]  We just got to get rid of the whole Bill of Rights.
[00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:55.027]  The war was never meant to be won according to the stated goals of eradicating narcotics.
[00:18:55.488 --> 00:19:14.763]  The narcotics trafficking corporations that had a monopoly into this country had lost their monopoly and prohibition had ended so they lost that cash cow and so they lobbied to make narcotics illegal and to create federal police and arm them to go after drug dealers and that was back in the twenties and it's never going to end!
[00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.263]  It'll be here in a hundred years!
[00:19:21.705 --> 00:19:25.147]  And it doesn't matter if drug use has more than doubled in the last ten years?
[00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:29.270]  It doesn't matter if every five years the War on Drugs funding doubles?
[00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:32.772]  None of that matters!
[00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:35.333]  And it's never going to matter to you!
[00:19:35.353 --> 00:19:37.495]  You just like war!
[00:19:39.975 --> 00:19:44.219]  And you're so foolish, you don't know the wars against you.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:52.787]  You're cheering for a war that's against the Bill of Rights and Constitution by a pack of criminals.
[00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:02.138]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:07.001]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:14.964]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.224 --> 00:20:20.607]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:27.790]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.432]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.672 --> 00:20:38.393]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:38.754 --> 00:20:46.336]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.696 --> 00:20:52.937]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.258 --> 00:20:56.778]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.118 --> 00:21:00.019]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:03.420]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.641]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:13.182]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:21:13.562 --> 00:21:22.471]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:21:22.671 --> 00:21:26.314]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:21:26.594 --> 00:21:31.639]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:38.626]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:21:39.116 --> 00:21:39.777]  What about you?
[00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:45.782]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:21:47.003 --> 00:21:48.904]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.811 --> 00:22:03.355]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:08.461]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[00:22:08.862 --> 00:22:15.130]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[00:22:15.691 --> 00:22:16.171]  We're good to go.
[00:22:33.104 --> 00:22:33.524]  516-8736.
[00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:39.429]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:46.274]  Just call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:47.315]  It's free.
[00:22:47.395 --> 00:22:50.818]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[00:23:03.364 --> 00:23:05.325]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:05.825 --> 00:23:08.247]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.027 --> 00:23:17.450]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:18.411 --> 00:23:23.273]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:23:23.948 --> 00:23:33.935]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:36.737]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:38.759]  For more information call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:38.819]  702-953-0267.
[00:23:47.503 --> 00:23:51.665]  I mean, this is a supposed free country with the will of the people, right?
[00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:21.488]  97% don't want existing roads being seized and turned into toll roads.
[00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:34.232]  99% don't like Supreme Court rulings saying private interest can take your property if they lobby local governments openly says they can pay them off.
[00:24:34.693 --> 00:24:35.913]  90% don't want open borders.
[00:24:37.954 --> 00:24:39.695]  You can go right down the line.
[00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:43.056]  Americans don't like what our government's doing.
[00:24:44.042 --> 00:24:47.965]  Almost 80% don't like the war, but it doesn't matter.
[00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:59.632]  So I just want the people that are pro-war, who think they're running things, and think they're part of the system, and I want you to really think about the fact that it doesn't matter what you think.
[00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:01.213]  It could be 100% of us.
[00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:04.995]  The New World Order is going to continue on with what they're doing.
[00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:07.497]  They do not care.
[00:25:08.453 --> 00:25:10.674]  And so I want you to consciously understand that.
[00:25:11.054 --> 00:25:19.258]  Because so many of these people who go along with the New World Order and make excuses for it, they think they're part of the power structure.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:28.623]  They're associating their whole identity with George Bush.
[00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:34.054]  George Bush, Hillary, Chuckie Schumer, Reid, they're all for the war.
[00:25:34.394 --> 00:25:36.836]  They're not just for leaving the troops like they were.
[00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:39.838]  Oh no, no, no, Bush has said he doesn't want more troops.
[00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:42.040]  They're saying we want even more.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.922]  Which is exactly what the Pentagon was actually calling for.
[00:25:46.643 --> 00:25:56.830]  And now they're Shanghaiing, we've confirmed this, they're Shanghaiing regular Navy and regular Air Force out.
[00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:24.763]  of their services that they signed up for enforcing them into ground forces and they've got four carrier groups that have been in the Gulf for a month the Persian Gulf and we told you that was a threat in Iran well now the White House says I have the AP right here that this is a threat to Iran and again you got good old boys out there but it doesn't matter that you're there supporting it they don't even need you let's just be clear about that
[00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:28.268]  But still, it's important to look at your psychology, that 22%.
[00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:31.269]  You think it's manly.
[00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:34.730]  You think it's manly to attack another country.
[00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.891]  You think it's cool.
[00:26:37.231 --> 00:26:45.174]  At a primitive level, you're with Team America, Tribe America, and you're standing firm with great courage.
[00:26:45.374 --> 00:26:48.775]  In fact, you probably get off on the fact that you're this tiny minority.
[00:26:49.195 --> 00:26:52.377]  You know, you're the only ones that understand what it takes to be American.
[00:26:52.937 --> 00:26:53.557]  American!
[00:26:54.835 --> 00:27:02.159]  The people running our country have bankrupted our dollar, bankrupted our governments by design.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.061]  They're dismantling the country.
[00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:06.262]  They've brought us into the North American Union.
[00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:09.084]  Do you think the war is any different?
[00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:16.988]  It is a direct assault on our good name, a direct assault on the dollar, a direct assault on the flower of our youth.
[00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:20.951]  Still, you don't care.
[00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.832]  You like propaganda simple.
[00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:28.289]  You're good, stick a plastic flag on your car, feel good, and just go into the night.
[00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:47.745]  Meanwhile, there is a growing group of Americans who are true warriors who are here defending the Republic in its last minutes of light as night falls and as the true assault builds up inside and outside our walls.
[00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:51.008]  And I will repeat, I am here
[00:27:52.825 --> 00:27:59.969]  Yelling as loud as I can from my rooftop, from my hilltop, that the enemy is at the gates and within the gates.
[00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:12.377]  And the enemy within the gates, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Republican and Democratic parties, are doing everything they can to lower that drawbridge to let the even larger force in.
[00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:21.603]  And I am sitting here trying to grab and stab and bayonet neocons in the Infowar off of the levers
[00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:32.051]  As they do everything they can, just screaming with hatred right now, everything they can, tooth and nail, to lower that drawbridge and open those gates.
[00:28:33.592 --> 00:28:38.894]  And they're screaming that we're traitors, telling the undecided in the crowd, Help us!
[00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:40.375]  Help us open the drawbridge!
[00:28:40.415 --> 00:28:41.876]  We're going to let friends in!
[00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:52.342]  I have the clips here, and we've written articles about it, where there have been calls for Matt Damon to be arrested,
[00:28:53.382 --> 00:28:58.585]  There have been calls for Keith Oberman to be arrested and put in concentration camps.
[00:28:59.106 --> 00:29:06.711]  The neocons now in unison for Michael Savage to Rush Limbaugh to Fox News to Michael Gallagher to Laura Ingraham.
[00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:10.933]  They're now openly calling us American Al Qaeda and saying we all need to be arrested.
[00:29:14.295 --> 00:29:21.060]  I've had old friends who I've protested, you know, with going back ten years ago
[00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.651]  Walk up to me and tell me that I need to be arrested.
[00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:33.674]  Because we're trying to stop them from opening the gates.
[00:29:37.455 --> 00:29:41.897]  So, we're going to come back and go to David, Bill, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:29:41.917 --> 00:29:46.919]  And we'll continue to try to man the gates here.
[00:29:51.682 --> 00:29:52.702]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.102 --> 00:29:54.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:58.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.022 --> 00:30:04.363]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:06.624]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.784 --> 00:30:13.908]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:14.108 --> 00:30:22.693]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:30:22.773 --> 00:30:22.853]  Yes!

[00:31:01.832 --> 00:31:05.814]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:09.597]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:31:09.857 --> 00:31:13.939]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:31:14.219 --> 00:31:15.160]  I was so amazed.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.241]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:31:18.442 --> 00:31:20.323]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:31:20.703 --> 00:31:25.886]  SoliWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:31:26.366 --> 00:31:32.270]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:31:32.551 --> 00:31:34.272]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:31:34.532 --> 00:31:37.714]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:41.797]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:43.579]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:31:43.879 --> 00:31:48.522]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit soleilwellness.com.
[00:31:49.423 --> 00:31:49.703]  I think so.
[00:32:13.803 --> 00:32:14.143]  I think so.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.520]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.006 --> 00:33:27.893]  We know that this war was designed to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year for the defense contractors on top of what they were making
[00:33:40.114 --> 00:33:43.837]  In a black hole, no-bid contract, nightmare land.
[00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:48.141]  We know it was designed to make the world hate us.
[00:33:48.241 --> 00:33:53.946]  We know it was designed to break up Iraq and hurt those people and commit genocide against them.
[00:33:54.186 --> 00:33:55.828]  The STATED PLAN!
[00:33:57.989 --> 00:34:01.713]  We know it was about destabilizing the entire region.
[00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:06.757]  To have widening, even worse, conflicts in the future.
[00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:13.465]  We know the American people, close to 80% are against it!
[00:34:14.726 --> 00:34:20.088]  But you watch, we'll be there in 2 years, in 5 years, in 10 years, in 20 years!
[00:34:22.249 --> 00:34:26.811]  The New World Order doesn't like a war where we go in there with a line of tanks and take over the enemy and
[00:34:29.036 --> 00:34:32.657]  Just take over the government and set up a central bank and then get the resources.
[00:34:32.917 --> 00:34:34.658]  That makes a fraction of the money.
[00:34:35.078 --> 00:34:39.540]  That gets a fraction of the control that just keeping a perpetual war does.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:49.424]  And the people that say you support the troops by going along with this plan, a killing field, it's shameful.
[00:34:50.804 --> 00:34:53.205]  It is absolutely 110% shameful.
[00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:02.094]  But listen, the people out there that support the war shouldn't worry.
[00:35:02.114 --> 00:35:03.415]  You're going to get what you want.
[00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:05.077]  Okay?
[00:35:05.097 --> 00:35:06.939]  You're going to get your heart's desire.
[00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:11.003]  A lot of you at a sick subconscious level want to bury your kids.
[00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:14.086]  You want to be out there with the 21-gun salute and a bugler.
[00:35:18.573 --> 00:35:29.857]  You want to stick stickers all over your car and tell everybody how you're in the military, and how your children are in it, and you're big warriors, and man, you're over there fighting them dirty Arabs?
[00:35:38.439 --> 00:35:39.019]  So fine!
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.861]  I mean, just do not think for a minute that you're going to draft any of my family.
[00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:47.522]  Do not think for a minute I'm going to go breathe your uranium.
[00:35:48.522 --> 00:35:52.145]  Do not think for a minute that I'm going to be part of this in any way.
[00:35:53.126 --> 00:36:03.435]  And for the rest of the American people who aren't for all of this and who have seen at least enough to know it's wrong, I salute you, I thank you for being sane.
[00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:09.681]  And now we have to recognize what we're living in.
[00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:15.585]  On every issue, the government is doing the opposite of what the American people want.
[00:36:15.605 --> 00:36:20.889]  They have national polls on the New Freedom Initiative, even with the polls spinning it to make it look good.
[00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:30.737]  Forced psychological testing, forced drugging, for everyone ages 4 to 18, 90 plus percent in major polls were against it.
[00:36:30.757 --> 00:36:40.005]  90 plus percent in major polls, they ran the gamut, they were all above 90, were against the Real ID Act.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.401]  Of last year.
[00:36:44.903 --> 00:36:49.046]  That the illegal aliens, by the way, now reported by the Associated Press, are exempt.
[00:36:49.066 --> 00:36:50.667]  I already knew it was exempt.
[00:36:50.707 --> 00:36:56.011]  I've been told by people in industry and in the DPS, state police, but now it's in the news.
[00:36:56.051 --> 00:36:56.571]  They're exempt!
[00:36:56.591 --> 00:37:00.274]  90 plus percent are against that.
[00:37:01.235 --> 00:37:02.295]  Government doesn't care.
[00:37:02.696 --> 00:37:05.158]  Because our government is bought and paid for.
[00:37:05.198 --> 00:37:08.460]  And when I say that, I mean it's really bought and paid for.
[00:37:09.637 --> 00:37:13.421]  And so let them act like dictators, let them be dictators.
[00:37:14.282 --> 00:37:17.726]  Like Patrick Henry said, my friends, the war has already begun.
[00:37:18.086 --> 00:37:19.527]  Why stand we here idle?
[00:37:23.532 --> 00:37:25.674]  So it had to get bad before it was going to get better.
[00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:40.850]  And so now we have to set about showing the American people how their will, but not just their will, what is constitutional is being ignored at every step of the way.
[00:37:42.651 --> 00:37:48.555]  The Democrats put out all that lip service about ending the war and getting our troops out of there.
[00:37:48.595 --> 00:37:50.696]  That's because they knew the American people wanted that.
[00:37:50.776 --> 00:37:52.317]  They won by a landslide.
[00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:56.160]  It looks like election fraud kept it from being a total takeover.
[00:37:58.362 --> 00:37:59.482]  A lot of evidence of fraud.
[00:38:01.623 --> 00:38:06.144]  And now they come in and it turns out they're even more hawkish than Bush.
[00:38:08.565 --> 00:38:11.745]  It's like they want to attack Serbia.
[00:38:12.085 --> 00:38:13.406]  That's what's so amazing about this.
[00:38:13.526 --> 00:38:18.327]  Our government, the criminals that run it, hire Al-Qaeda, hire Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:21.228]  These are a Senate Republican report, 1999.
[00:38:24.549 --> 00:38:25.769]  To attack the Serbs.
[00:38:26.866 --> 00:38:30.188]  I mean, we're talking Al-Qaeda blowing up school buses, attacking schools.
[00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.350]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:33.911]  Go after the young.
[00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:36.953]  That will always get people hopping mad.
[00:38:37.754 --> 00:38:39.595]  The Serbs pour into their South.
[00:38:40.876 --> 00:38:45.599]  They drive out the KLA, and here comes the US of A. Always on the wrong side.
[00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:47.120]  Always doing evil.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.781]  Always supporting evil.
[00:38:49.562 --> 00:38:51.143]  Always helping the New World Order.
[00:38:57.387 --> 00:38:59.088]  Always trying to break up countries.
[00:39:03.432 --> 00:39:04.032]  It's amazing.
[00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:07.554]  It's unbelievable.
[00:39:08.475 --> 00:39:10.457]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls and I'm going to do that now.
[00:39:11.497 --> 00:39:12.238]  It's just AP.
[00:39:12.278 --> 00:39:14.680]  Pentagon wants $99.7 billion.
[00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:24.387]  The Pentagon wants the White House to seek an additional $99.7 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan according to information provided by the AP.
[00:39:25.242 --> 00:39:33.691]  The military's request, if embraced by the President and approved by Congress, would boost this year's budget for those wars to about $170 billion.
[00:39:33.711 --> 00:39:38.636]  That is above the $600 plus billion in the 2007 John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:39:47.896 --> 00:39:52.917]  Military planners assembled the proposal at a time when Bush is developing new strategies for Iraq.
[00:39:53.197 --> 00:39:54.418]  They're the exact same strategies.
[00:39:54.438 --> 00:40:00.679]  Again, they have the Iraq Study Group appointed by him, run by his daddy's people, comes out and proposes the exact same stuff.
[00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:06.681]  Bush comes out and attacks it to fool the left in this country to think if Bush is attacking it, it must be a good plan.
[00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:08.821]  Oh, please don't throw me in the Briar Patch!
[00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:13.382]  Well, that's exactly where Br'er Rabbit wants to be thrown away.
[00:40:13.582 --> 00:40:14.703]  You ever heard the children's tale?
[00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:16.083]  The, uh,
[00:40:17.395 --> 00:40:19.776]  What is it, the farmer catches Briar Rabbit by the ears?
[00:40:19.816 --> 00:40:20.496]  He's going to eat him?
[00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:21.696]  He's going to stew him?
[00:40:22.036 --> 00:40:24.697]  And Briar Rabbit says, please don't throw me in the briar patch!
[00:40:25.777 --> 00:40:34.119]  And the stupid antagonist throws him in the briar patch where he lives, where he can't be caught.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.240]  Bush comes out, please don't boost the troops!
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.761]  Please don't keep us there!
[00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:46.182]  Please don't put it into a non-politicized process so it can go on forever!
[00:40:48.707 --> 00:40:50.248]  Oh yeah, we'll show you, Bush!
[00:40:52.430 --> 00:41:00.595]  Now Democrats are swaggering around, going, well, we've taken control of the process, now we're doing what's right in the war, well now the war's okay.
[00:41:05.418 --> 00:41:08.520]  Overall, the war in Iraq has cost about $350 billion.
[00:41:09.061 --> 00:41:14.604]  Combined with the conflict in Afghanistan and operations against terrorism elsewhere, the cost has topped $500 billion.
[00:41:14.644 --> 00:41:15.625]  It's actually much higher than that.
[00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:18.227]  According to the Nonpartisan Congressional Research Service,
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:27.403]  The additional funds approved would push this year's cost of the war in Iraq to about $50 billion over last year's record of $70 plus billion.
[00:41:29.644 --> 00:41:37.926]  A description of the Pentagon request was provided by a person familiar with the proposal who asked for an anonymity because the person was unauthorized to release the information.
[00:41:38.426 --> 00:41:45.909]  So we've got that right there and we have top Democrats coming out
[00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:48.428]  Who want to increase trip levels.
[00:41:49.509 --> 00:41:55.193]  And that means trips that have been there three and a half years will start their fifth tours in about six months.
[00:41:55.793 --> 00:42:00.496]  Imagine you sign up for three years, you're going to be there four years later.
[00:42:00.857 --> 00:42:02.618]  In World War II, one tour.
[00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:04.219]  In Vietnam, one tour.
[00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:06.240]  In Korea, one tour.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.102]  And still people were basket cases in most cases.
[00:42:09.703 --> 00:42:14.846]  No matter how macho you are, your glands just can't supply the juice that long.
[00:42:17.028 --> 00:42:18.888]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:42:18.908 --> 00:42:29.671]  Not too good from the way you're talking it here it sounds, but I wanted to open the call with a story about how they might hide things in plain sight
[00:42:45.464 --> 00:42:52.127]  I was watching a movie about two cops that work in Miami in the vice unit and there was an interesting thing that I saw.
[00:42:52.187 --> 00:42:57.310]  I saw the character who played the big bad drug dealer sitting on his bed and guess what he was watching?
[00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.450]  The stock market.
[00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.011]  So that kind of tells me that he has interest in that avenue.
[00:43:01.752 --> 00:43:13.057]  And also another frame of the show fixated on this large eyeball that stayed there for about five seconds and kind of drifted into the street level overview.
[00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:16.659]  No point to the movie of that being any kind of relevant.
[00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:24.420]  They just had a big ol' eyeball on the front of the TV just looking at you for five or eight seconds and I was just... I found that kind of interesting.
[00:43:25.441 --> 00:43:26.781]  So anyway, going to a question.
[00:43:27.761 --> 00:43:39.384]  With all the corruption, with all the knowledge of corruption, with all this long-term, dirty dealing, decade of decadence, when will these people be held accountable in serious measures?
[00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:43.153]  Well this is how corruption works, and the corrupt know this.
[00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:47.356]  Either they go for broke and take everything over, or they finally collapse and lose.
[00:43:47.676 --> 00:43:51.879]  So it's built in, it's incentivized for them to bring in total tyranny.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.522]  And so it may just continue and continue and get worse and worse and worse.
[00:43:55.982 --> 00:43:59.344]  And they're changing all the laws to take your property, to take your guns.
[00:44:00.045 --> 00:44:01.786]  They'll twist it and say it's conservative.
[00:44:02.046 --> 00:44:04.868]  They're now saying it's for security to have a North American Union.
[00:44:05.148 --> 00:44:07.190]  So all the neocons are saying we must have it.
[00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.492]  You're American Al-Qaeda if you aren't for it.
[00:44:10.512 --> 00:44:11.673]  We've got to take your kids.
[00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:12.714]  It's for America.
[00:44:13.014 --> 00:44:14.715]  We've got to raid your house.
[00:44:14.755 --> 00:44:15.616]  It's for America.
[00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:18.478]  We've got to force vaccines on you to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:18.778 --> 00:44:20.739]  Just let us run your life.
[00:44:20.799 --> 00:44:21.600]  It's for your own good.
[00:44:22.105 --> 00:44:30.089]  Here's the reality, you and many others are standing together shoulder by shoulder with the members proving it, that we're trying to expose these people.
[00:44:30.509 --> 00:44:35.852]  People are coming out, people are talking, they're not shutting up, they're not afraid to be an American and stand up for this country.
[00:44:36.514 --> 00:44:37.876]  That's right.
[00:44:53.252 --> 00:44:54.052]  That will stand up.
[00:44:54.132 --> 00:45:01.173]  So they're busy getting the 20% ready to physically fight with the police and military against the American people.
[00:45:01.193 --> 00:45:03.474]  That's why there's all the talk of FEMA camps are good.
[00:45:03.754 --> 00:45:05.054]  We should put Americans in them.
[00:45:05.354 --> 00:45:06.774]  Yeah, let's arrest everybody.
[00:45:06.994 --> 00:45:16.016]  Because the criminal tiny 1% and their 20% moron minions are going to try to physically make us be their slaves.
[00:45:16.596 --> 00:45:19.377]  And I'm doing everything I can to avert that physical violence.
[00:45:19.777 --> 00:45:21.157]  But they're chomping for a fight.
[00:45:21.277 --> 00:45:21.797]  They want it.
[00:45:22.313 --> 00:45:27.316]  The show is called Infowars and that's the greatest title you can possibly put on it because it is an information war.
[00:45:27.836 --> 00:45:37.141]  I was talking to friends and family about Skull and Bones and how our president and John Kerry are the Skull and Bones and there's many people inside the high elite societies that are coming from this
[00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:38.240]  Good to go.
[00:45:54.517 --> 00:45:55.218]  We're good to go.
[00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.090]  Well, guess what?
[00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:12.631]  It's not going to stay that way forever.
[00:46:12.671 --> 00:46:13.692]  People are going to believe.
[00:46:14.092 --> 00:46:17.253]  People are going to look at the facts and go with it and run with it.
[00:46:17.353 --> 00:46:17.774]  That's right.
[00:46:17.794 --> 00:46:18.714]  I appreciate your call.
[00:46:19.374 --> 00:46:25.097]  International Russian Television is here right now videotaping the show, our operations.
[00:46:25.277 --> 00:46:27.899]  They're doing a show on Bohemian Grove.
[00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:34.482]  I've had Dutch and Japanese TV contact me this week about Bohemian Grove.
[00:46:35.822 --> 00:46:37.163]  So, yes, the word is getting out.
[00:46:37.243 --> 00:46:38.604]  Bill and Tennessee are on the air.
[00:46:38.644 --> 00:46:39.024]  Go ahead.
[00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:44.062]  When am I going to be getting my national ID card in the mail?
[00:46:44.082 --> 00:46:48.944]  Okay, is this, is this, is this Troy?
[00:46:49.024 --> 00:46:50.324]  My name's Bull!
[00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:52.285]  Pardon me?
[00:46:52.305 --> 00:46:53.925]  My name's Bull!
[00:46:55.665 --> 00:46:56.706]  It sounds like Troll.
[00:46:56.786 --> 00:46:59.767]  Hey Bull!
[00:46:59.807 --> 00:47:00.867]  Seriously, call her.
[00:47:01.127 --> 00:47:04.348]  When am I going to be getting my national ID card?
[00:47:05.617 --> 00:47:06.718]  So I get your joke.
[00:47:07.318 --> 00:47:09.338]  You think it's going to say National ID Card on it?
[00:47:09.418 --> 00:47:10.199]  Yeah!
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.060]  Okay.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:22.503]  Starting in 1993 in a pilot test under a Bill Clinton executive order, they began standardizing IDs around the country.
[00:47:22.663 --> 00:47:24.464]  When am I going to get mine?
[00:47:25.184 --> 00:47:26.684]  You have one right now in your wallet.
[00:47:26.704 --> 00:47:31.746]  If you have a Tennessee driver's license, it has been federally standardized.
[00:47:33.407 --> 00:47:33.867]  Okay.
[00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:36.624]  All right, thank you for the call.
[00:47:36.804 --> 00:47:37.264]  Very funny.
[00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:39.706]  That's another thing they do.
[00:47:39.746 --> 00:47:46.831]  I've been on national talk shows, local talk shows, and the host will say, what's this on your website about national ID cards?
[00:47:47.732 --> 00:47:49.193]  There's no national ID card.
[00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.674]  I've got a state driver's license.
[00:47:50.694 --> 00:47:52.275]  I've got a California driver's license.
[00:47:53.496 --> 00:47:55.598]  And I say, no, it's a federal ID card.
[00:47:55.938 --> 00:47:57.499]  No, it says California.
[00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:59.701]  Now, they know full well it's a national ID.
[00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:01.902]  Their job is to lie to their listeners.
[00:48:03.343 --> 00:48:03.964]  Let me say it again.
[00:48:04.927 --> 00:48:14.230]  Starting in 93 with Texas as the beta test, they began taking a digital face scan photo and a biometric thumbprint.
[00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:19.692]  By 95, a majority of states had it.
[00:48:19.972 --> 00:48:30.315]  By 2000, all but two states were taking biometrics and had already federally standardized with a barcode, a magnetic strip,
[00:48:32.347 --> 00:48:35.049]  So what they do is they put it in place, then they make a law.
[00:48:35.649 --> 00:48:39.872]  Like Bush was already spying on American citizens, then he gets in trouble and tries to pass a law.
[00:48:40.152 --> 00:48:44.114]  Or he's already grabbing citizens and sending them to torture camps, then he passes the law.
[00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:44.475]  H.R.
[00:48:44.495 --> 00:48:45.495]  6166, see?
[00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:46.636]  Once he gets in trouble.
[00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:53.620]  So, through highway funds, and through funded and unfunded mandates, they had the states adopt it.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.561]  Texas was first.
[00:48:57.683 --> 00:49:00.625]  California and Texas and New York and a few others are the bellwethers.
[00:49:03.115 --> 00:49:04.336]  And so they put it in place.
[00:49:05.457 --> 00:49:18.747]  Then, in 2005, they passed the REAL ID Act that, under federal law, all states had to adopt federal standards and be integrated into the database.
[00:49:19.647 --> 00:49:21.669]  Well, most states had already done it.
[00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:28.922]  But, just like, here's an example, they have a regional Sports Illustrated.
[00:49:29.243 --> 00:49:31.283]  Well, they've got like ten different brands of Sports Illustrated.
[00:49:31.663 --> 00:49:37.265]  Basically the same articles inside, you're buying it from Sports Illustrated, but it has your regional look, your regional teams.
[00:49:38.326 --> 00:49:39.366]  And so you think it's local.
[00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.907]  Alright, well it's the same thing with the national ID card.
[00:49:43.388 --> 00:49:46.229]  And they'll argue with you all day, no, no, this is a driver's license.
[00:49:46.649 --> 00:49:47.269]  No it's not!
[00:49:47.389 --> 00:49:49.270]  Federal law, it's a national ID card.
[00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:52.471]  Finally the media is announcing it, what, a few weeks ago we played a
[00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:55.451]  K-X-A-N piece here?
[00:49:56.572 --> 00:49:57.692]  No, it's a K-V-U-E.
[00:49:58.072 --> 00:49:58.992]  It was an ABC piece.
[00:49:59.192 --> 00:50:02.433]  Hey, can you dig that piece up, John, from two, three weeks ago?
[00:50:03.754 --> 00:50:06.114]  Yeah, see if you can find it of the thousands of things in the computer.
[00:50:06.714 --> 00:50:10.075]  It was like two, maybe three weeks ago, actually.
[00:50:10.095 --> 00:50:12.056]  Because people don't believe me.
[00:50:12.536 --> 00:50:20.358]  How about you just hear the newscast telling you ten years after I warned you?
[00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:23.219]  Ten years.
[00:50:25.293 --> 00:50:39.438]  Ten years ago, I went into the state driver's license facility in North Austin with over a hundred great Americans, and I laid out and gave a speech and said everything that was going to happen and held up the executive order and read it.
[00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.119]  It's in America Destroyed by Design.
[00:50:43.179 --> 00:50:45.160]  Now available on DVD, I would add, finally.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.680]  And now it's here!
[00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:50.021]  Now it's here!
[00:50:52.242 --> 00:50:52.522]  Okay?
[00:50:54.528 --> 00:50:56.909]  And they're going to give you a national sales tax now with that baby.
[00:50:57.469 --> 00:50:58.429]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:50:58.449 --> 00:51:05.111]  It's here.
[00:51:05.311 --> 00:51:10.072]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.452 --> 00:51:18.074]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.812 --> 00:51:25.856]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:37.662]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.982 --> 00:51:41.484]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.964 --> 00:51:43.845]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:48.047]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:04.273]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.593 --> 00:52:09.514]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking a hot shower than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.774 --> 00:52:14.115]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.415 --> 00:52:23.337]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.537 --> 00:52:27.158]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.458 --> 00:52:32.487]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.787 --> 00:52:39.479]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.986 --> 00:52:40.626]  What about you?

[00:53:57.188 --> 00:53:59.811]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:15.538 --> 00:54:18.359]  Yeah, that's what it comes down to.
[00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:53.262]  The government has its cannons pointed at you, the police are militarized, are arrogant, have been trained to be against us.
[00:54:54.302 --> 00:55:01.245]  The military has been trained to take our guns, to put us in camps, and now we didn't have Alex Jones warning you about secret concentration camp programs.
[00:55:01.986 --> 00:55:10.349]  It's professors, it's talk show hosts, it's all these people can talk about and they lick their lips and go, one more attack and you're all going in camps.
[00:55:11.098 --> 00:55:25.171]  Here's a local newscast, and when I saw this newscast, I knew of course it would be on every other ABC newscast in the country, because they produce these nationally, then send the video down locally, so it gives it the illusion of local, but it's the same message.
[00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:27.393]  You must all take vaccines, it's the law.
[00:55:27.773 --> 00:55:29.795]  There is no more mercury in the vaccines, it's the law.
[00:55:30.876 --> 00:55:32.698]  The mercury's in the vaccines, it's good for you.
[00:55:34.118 --> 00:55:36.599]  You know, the national ID card is here, it's good for you.
[00:55:37.419 --> 00:55:39.440]  It's this unified message.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.141]  Here it is, telling you about your new national ID card right here in Texas.
[00:55:44.501 --> 00:55:50.803]  Tonight we're tracking massive changes that are coming for anyone with a Texas driver's license or state ID.
[00:55:51.003 --> 00:55:55.584]  If you thought you could avoid the lines of the DMV and renew by mail or perhaps the internet,
[00:55:56.204 --> 00:55:56.784]  Think again.
[00:55:56.924 --> 00:55:59.225]  We've been doing some checking on a new federal law.
[00:55:59.265 --> 00:56:03.666]  And you'll love it as reporter Nancy Holland has discovered it'll cost you time and money.
[00:56:04.886 --> 00:56:06.186]  Twenty-four.
[00:56:06.306 --> 00:56:07.386]  Twenty-five.
[00:56:07.426 --> 00:56:10.567]  Five million people a year get driver's licenses in Texas.
[00:56:10.707 --> 00:56:11.427]  Twenty-six.
[00:56:11.547 --> 00:56:15.908]  But even after a holiday, the line is nothing compared to what people here expect.
[00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:16.989]  Twenty-seven.
[00:56:17.049 --> 00:56:18.969]  You'll expect it around the building.
[00:56:20.416 --> 00:56:21.317]  I'm not going to play all of it.
[00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.378]  We posted it on Infowars.com a few weeks ago.
[00:56:23.438 --> 00:56:27.240]  But notice, they don't talk about the story like, do you want a national ID card?
[00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:57.195]  It's just, oh, it's going to cause big lines, but don't worry, the feds are being told by the state to give them some money.
[00:56:58.256 --> 00:57:08.382]  Oh, it isn't face-scanning cameras going up everywhere bad, tracking everything you do and where you go, it's that, oh, sometimes they give false IDs, we need to fix that and then it's okay.
[00:57:09.023 --> 00:57:10.824]  You see, to give the illusion of
[00:57:11.952 --> 00:57:20.337]  Non-partisanship or the illusion of not having an angle, they will create a false debate that isn't the central issue.
[00:57:20.397 --> 00:57:25.640]  Just another tactic, you know, all written in New York by the psychological warfare experts.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.281]  Most of them on government payroll.
[00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:29.902]  Oh, again, we told you that over a decade ago.
[00:57:29.943 --> 00:57:31.323]  Now it's been all over the news.
[00:57:31.583 --> 00:57:33.745]  1.6 billion just in one year of fake news.
[00:57:34.065 --> 00:57:35.486]  Then Bush made those numbers secret.
[00:57:35.646 --> 00:57:36.887]  He was told it was totally illegal.
[00:57:36.907 --> 00:57:38.047]  Of course, he didn't start it.
[00:57:38.067 --> 00:57:39.188]  It's been going on for 50 years.
[00:57:40.655 --> 00:57:48.059]  Yeah, a lot of your top editors are CIA, Defense Intelligence, National Security Agency, or they're part of other big private think tanks that get government funding.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.240]  And they're there!
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:50.980]  They're on a team.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.361]  They get all the sweetheart deals.
[00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:53.922]  They get all the great investment tips.
[00:57:53.962 --> 00:57:55.082]  They get to do whatever they want.
[00:57:56.663 --> 00:58:02.126]  They get to be above the law, like Sandy Berger, caught red-handed stealing ultra-secret documents, and he doesn't get in trouble.
[00:58:03.406 --> 00:58:03.947]  But you!
[00:58:04.707 --> 00:58:05.728]  You're going to be kept in line.
[00:58:05.768 --> 00:58:07.088]  You're going to be told how to jump.
[00:58:07.408 --> 00:58:08.389]  Before I end this hour,
[00:58:09.557 --> 00:58:15.578]  I want to encourage everybody to get my original seven films that I've never gotten on DVD to get them.
[00:58:15.598 --> 00:58:16.338]  They're now available.
[00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:20.999]  All three of my police state films on three DVDs in a box set $34.95.
[00:58:21.319 --> 00:58:23.360]  That's almost half off.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.420]  That's available right now.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:30.501]  America Destroyed by Design, The Masters of Terror, The Matrix of Evil, The Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed.
[00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:32.402]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:34.767 --> 00:58:38.188]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:58:38.428 --> 00:58:39.468]  Check an hour straight ahead.

[00:58:45.929 --> 00:58:46.349]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.509 --> 00:58:47.130]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:52.911]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.331 --> 00:58:55.851]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.855 --> 00:59:04.756]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:09.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.601 --> 00:59:13.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:28.199]  Just in the news today, Maryland five-year-old accused of pinching a teacher's behind, being charged with sex crimes.
[00:59:29.227 --> 00:59:31.569]  Four-year-old accused of improperly touching teacher.
[00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:33.891]  It says for hugging the teacher.
[00:59:35.893 --> 00:59:38.636]  Draw a picture of a gun in art class, you get arrested.
[00:59:39.336 --> 00:59:47.544]  It's all about taking behavior that is innocent and criminalizing instead of someone getting in trouble for hugging or something like that.
[00:59:48.265 --> 00:59:50.747]  Now it's about maximum enforcement.
[00:59:52.444 --> 01:00:01.990]  Criminalizing speech, criminalizing expression, criminalizing hugging, criminalizing tag, dodgeball, getting everyone into the system.
[01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:03.572]  We'll be going over that.
[01:00:03.612 --> 01:00:12.658]  We have a guest in studio, one of the main anthropologists on the film, Apocalypto, to talk about just humans' bloodlust, why this runs through all cultures, and about the film some.
[01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:19.019]  But I've always been into the Aztecs and what happened down there and the Mayan culture overall.
[01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:20.640]  So that's, you know, you've heard me talk a lot about it.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.701]  That's why we're covering this on a few shows.
[01:00:23.962 --> 01:00:28.904]  Also, Freightliner plans Mexico Factory despite layoffs elsewhere.
[01:00:28.924 --> 01:00:40.229]  In the U.S., Daimler Chrysler's Portland-based Freightliner unit will build a $300 million truck plant in Mexico, but then lay off 4,000 North American employees.
[01:00:41.756 --> 01:00:42.036]  U.S.
[01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:42.657]  employees.
[01:00:43.217 --> 01:00:46.058]  Look at this, Detroit police sergeant tasered by cops.
[01:00:46.839 --> 01:00:48.160]  Wait till we tell you about that.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.981]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:55.664]  Mark in Georgia, then John, Louis, Danny, Skip, and Anders.
[01:00:55.704 --> 01:00:56.284]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:00:57.124 --> 01:01:07.250]  Yes, Alex, this is Mark, and I'd like to go ahead and let you know this is Mark Clayton for anybody out there who thinks that you should be ashamed to associate with Alex Jones.
[01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.211]  I am proud to be on this show.
[01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:21.263]  I'm proud to have gotten through today to be able to talk to you, Alex, and I want to thank you personally for one of the most important pieces of journalism in exposing the Bohemian Grove in American history.
[01:01:22.904 --> 01:01:37.016]  I worked with the late William J. Gill in our last small and ignominious push to try to halt our march into a complete and total free trade empire, which we are now in and there is no retreat from.
[01:01:38.877 --> 01:01:48.739]  He personally knew people for years who went to the Bohemian Grove, and he never knew anything about this Moloch idol worship.
[01:01:49.479 --> 01:01:53.660]  I told him about that, and I brought your video in, and I showed that to him.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:02:06.943]  Incidentally, just in case you're wondering, he's the man who is mainly behind influencing Pat Buchanan to abandon the neoconservative free trade ideology, and then come out with his protectionist stance for his 1990
[01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:12.132]  ... for his first presidential run.
[01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:23.336]  So, when I showed him your video, Alex, he said... Now, this is a man who had a who's who of the people he knew in American history.
[01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:29.379]  He had a whole stack of biographies, a whole bookcase full of biographies of people he knew.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:38.043]  He said, when he saw that, he said, this would explain all of the insanity I've been dealing with for all these years.
[01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:52.665]  He personally worked for Richard Mellon Scaife, one of the financiers of the conservative movement of our lifetime, and Richard Mellon Scaife went out to the Bohemian Grove quite often, according to Bill Gill.
[01:02:53.145 --> 01:03:05.770]  Now, it's no small wonder that Bill Gill was not invited to the Bohemian Grove, because Bill Gill is a patriot, and he would never sell out his country for a bunch of garbage, moloch, idol worship.
[01:03:07.532 --> 01:03:12.174]  Well, and it's not just the bizarre drunkenness and the sex and the Moloch stuff.
[01:03:12.535 --> 01:03:18.958]  It's also, we've gotten transcripts of the Lakeside Chats, which are all New World Order in nature, get rid of U.S.
[01:03:18.998 --> 01:03:21.199]  sovereignty, bring in one world government.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.721]  Well, I really appreciate everything that you've done, Alex.
[01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:28.323]  I've started a website with my cousin.
[01:03:28.383 --> 01:03:30.724]  I've had seriously... Fire the website out.
[01:03:30.744 --> 01:03:31.224]  We're out of time.
[01:03:31.984 --> 01:03:34.286]  Okay, it's governmentnews.org.
[01:03:35.006 --> 01:03:36.507]  Hey, that's a good website.
[01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:36.987]  Thank you.
[01:03:37.699 --> 01:03:38.741]  That's a good address name.
[01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:40.245]  Thank you, GovernmentNews.org.
[01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:42.209]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:44.514]  It's the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:47.380]  Straight back to your calls on the news, on the other side.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:56.780]  It's here!
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.783]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.144 --> 01:04:09.809]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:17.533]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:24.798]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:29.331]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.651 --> 01:04:33.172]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.632 --> 01:04:35.513]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:39.794]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.819 --> 01:04:58.103]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:58.323 --> 01:05:00.404]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:00.644 --> 01:05:07.769]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:07.889 --> 01:05:19.437]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:05:19.817 --> 01:05:21.098]  Its multi-voltage capability
[01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:21.618]  We're good to go!
[01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:55.992]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:56.492 --> 01:05:59.815]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:06:00.175 --> 01:06:03.137]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:09.783]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:06:09.863 --> 01:06:14.266]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:06:14.486 --> 01:06:18.848]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:21.609]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:24.410]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:27.411]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:31.713]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:32.593]  Treasury bonds.
[01:06:32.873 --> 01:06:37.517]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:06:37.697 --> 01:06:39.338]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:39.358 --> 01:06:40.919]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:06:57.777 --> 01:06:58.437]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.097 --> 01:07:00.158]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:01.998]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:03.438]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:05.239]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.759 --> 01:07:09.719]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:36.508 --> 01:07:38.108]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:38.508 --> 01:07:41.349]  Let's go ahead and go straight back to your phone calls.
[01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.071]  Let's talk to John in New York.
[01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:44.911]  John, you're on the air.
[01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:45.571]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:45.591 --> 01:07:46.331]  Hi, Alex.
[01:07:46.351 --> 01:07:46.692]  How are you?
[01:07:47.012 --> 01:07:47.352]  Good, sir.
[01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:49.553]  I just wanted to say that I love you and that
[01:07:51.205 --> 01:07:55.226]  You work harder than anybody else that I've ever seen, but I have three questions, quick questions.
[01:07:55.706 --> 01:08:02.747]  Number one, there's so much evidence covering 9-11 from every angle, exposing it as an inside job and nothing's happening.
[01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:05.988]  Nobody's getting arrested, nobody's getting impeached, no jail.
[01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:09.969]  Number two, Bush just came out and said he needs more troops.
[01:08:10.389 --> 01:08:11.449]  Does that mean a draft?
[01:08:11.849 --> 01:08:14.610]  And number three, what happened to Scholars for 9-11 Truth?
[01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.430]  And I'll hang up and wait for your answer.
[01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:16.750]  Thank you.
[01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:20.231]  Okay, the first question, I got so busy thinking about the
[01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:22.515]  A second two.
[01:08:22.655 --> 01:08:25.936]  Oh yeah!
[01:08:26.476 --> 01:08:36.059]  84% of Americans in a New York Times, ABC News poll, Angus and Reed, very scientific, very respected, believe they're being lied to about the official 9-11 story.
[01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:45.622]  36% of Scripps Howard News Service, Ohio University, extremely respected, believe it is a total inside job, with 68% believing there's a cover-up.
[01:08:46.869 --> 01:08:58.035]  So, any way you cut it, the majority think they're being lied to, and a large portion of the public, when they get a cold phone call, and that's a scary call, how do you think the government did it?
[01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:00.796]  Yes.
[01:09:00.816 --> 01:09:00.796]  36%.
[01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:12.722]  Studies show in polling data, that if it's a really controversial question, people will err on the side of conservatism, and I don't mean on the classical sense, I mean, you know, they'll say what's more mainstream to their mind.
[01:09:13.163 --> 01:09:14.643]  So it's probably actually double that.
[01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:15.804]  But still,
[01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:20.720]  All these prominent people have gone public on 9-11, more and more every day, every week.
[01:09:22.141 --> 01:09:23.963]  We've had a 9-11 whitewash commission.
[01:09:23.983 --> 01:09:37.715]  You know, first Bush didn't want an investigation, because he knew it would become kind of a Warren report, like with Kennedy, which the whitewash itself would be a road map to show the lies and the fraud.
[01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:42.033]  And so he appointed Henry Kissinger as the chairman.
[01:09:42.073 --> 01:09:44.375]  Everybody freaked out, you know, calling him independent.
[01:09:45.176 --> 01:09:54.403]  It now has come out that for at least four years Kissinger has been at the White House every week advising Rove and Bush on the most minute details.
[01:09:55.144 --> 01:10:01.489]  So imagine, Kissinger's running the White House and then he's going to be appointed chairman of the, quote, independent commission.
[01:10:01.589 --> 01:10:01.729]  Ha!
[01:10:01.949 --> 01:10:02.089]  Ha!
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:03.410]  Yeah, it's independent.
[01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:06.413]  And that's, again, another insult to our intelligence.
[01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:17.047]  And so they go ahead and have Hamilton Commission, the Keene-Hamilton Commission, two big insiders, just as big as Kissinger, just less known.
[01:10:19.368 --> 01:10:21.429]  They put out a 400 and something page lie.
[01:10:22.569 --> 01:10:23.250]  It doesn't work.
[01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:27.432]  And so in the court of public opinion, they've been convicted of 9-11.
[01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:44.386]  But the problem is, the establishment is so corrupt, so many of the judges are corrupt, so many of the police are corrupt, so many of the grand juries are just rubber stamps who are told what to do, because they never research what their real role is, that this corruption just goes on.
[01:10:45.447 --> 01:10:53.532]  I mean, 20 years ago, people went to prison for no-bid, secret contracts to companies that their wife was a board member of.
[01:10:54.072 --> 01:10:56.814]  Vice President does it now, nothing's done.
[01:10:57.572 --> 01:10:59.273]  Years ago, people would go to prison.
[01:10:59.313 --> 01:11:04.817]  The whole government would be overthrown for almost $4 trillion at the start of 2001.
[01:11:05.078 --> 01:11:07.079]  It was only $1.9 trillion.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.682]  Two days after it breaks in the Associated Press, 9-11 happens.
[01:11:12.243 --> 01:11:12.843]  Just admit it.
[01:11:12.903 --> 01:11:13.744]  Trillions missing.
[01:11:14.124 --> 01:11:15.425]  It comes out in congressional hearings.
[01:11:15.485 --> 01:11:16.866]  Rumsfeld says, I don't know where it is.
[01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:17.767]  We're not going to discuss it.
[01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.469]  Trillions missing!
[01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:24.819]  Nobody goes to jail, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:11:25.119 --> 01:11:34.443]  The American people get mad about Enron and Global Crossing and a few things, so they send Martha Stewart to prison for doing absolutely nothing.
[01:11:34.683 --> 01:11:43.627]  It's like she's got a crooked toenail and they're busy basically axe-murdering our society, but she goes to jail for the crooked toenail.
[01:11:45.707 --> 01:11:46.888]  Kinlay gets convicted.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:58.268]  And rightfully so, but he was just a front man for a big drug cartel, big money laundering op, and big intelligence op, and he dies conveniently.
[01:11:58.328 --> 01:11:59.329]  I mean, come on!
[01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.852]  So, another illustration.
[01:12:02.892 --> 01:12:03.992]  Again, what I said last hour.
[01:12:04.012 --> 01:12:17.163]  90 plus percent don't want the toll roads on existing roads, don't want North American Union, don't want national ID cards, don't want forced psychological testing and drugging, don't like airport screening, don't like any of this!
[01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:28.487]  But the government is going to continue to push it, the media is going to continue to push it, because they're owned by the big private banks, they're owned by the defense contractors that own big pharma.
[01:12:28.687 --> 01:12:32.368]  You know, I have a friend, a good friend who works for Continental Airlines in security.
[01:12:32.388 --> 01:12:34.208]  He said I could say that, just don't say his name.
[01:12:35.628 --> 01:12:42.490]  He's at the Austin-Berkshire Airport, and he saw News 8 Austin earlier this year.
[01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:47.052]  Interview, he said it had to be over 40 people.
[01:12:47.312 --> 01:12:49.453]  A huge line of people that were walking by.
[01:12:49.813 --> 01:12:52.154]  They were interviewing him, had the permission of the airport.
[01:12:53.615 --> 01:12:55.276]  Of course, because it was going to be a puff piece.
[01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.136]  That's another way control works.
[01:12:57.216 --> 01:12:59.857]  If they don't do a puff piece, they can't come back and shoot later.
[01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:02.439]  See, that's where arbitrary press control is bad, too.
[01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:05.600]  Because it allows government to hand it out like lollipops.
[01:13:08.441 --> 01:13:11.382]  And he saw, after about 40 people, he was sitting there counting them.
[01:13:11.702 --> 01:13:12.203]  What did he say? 45.
[01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:17.017]  This little old lady comes up and says she loves the new screening procedures.
[01:13:17.057 --> 01:13:22.278]  They just started some even more harsh ones and she just thought it was wonderful and she loved being searched to keep her safe.
[01:13:22.838 --> 01:13:25.438]  And he said he knew right then it'd be on News 8.
[01:13:26.539 --> 01:13:27.639]  He got home that night.
[01:13:27.839 --> 01:13:29.499]  I'm also friends with his brother, that's how I know him.
[01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.340]  He turns it on and boom!
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.000]  Who do you see on the news?
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.961]  The little old lady and the news reporting that everybody loves it.
[01:13:42.495 --> 01:13:45.117]  Now, that should scare everybody.
[01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:53.442]  The fact that they get on the TV and radio, and I know I've been beating this drum a little because it's important, and tell you it's the law, you gotta take vaccines.
[01:13:54.042 --> 01:13:54.462]  No law.
[01:13:57.104 --> 01:13:59.846]  It's the law, you gotta let cops search you without a warrant now.
[01:14:00.026 --> 01:14:01.447]  No law, what they're doing is illegal.
[01:14:03.168 --> 01:14:05.870]  Oh, everyone loves being searched in more security.
[01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:09.832]  The truth is they had to interview 45 people before it happened.
[01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:14.601]  The truth is, is 145th liked it.
[01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:30.434]  And so it's all the neocons and the fake liberal media all together telling us we're the minority, telling us we're bad, telling us we're conspiracy theorists, telling us we're kooks, telling us all this.
[01:14:30.775 --> 01:14:35.058]  And so if you expect some judge to order, you know, the
[01:14:36.343 --> 01:14:42.484]  Investigation, or to call in a grand jury, or some district attorney to, and for indictments to be handed down.
[01:14:42.964 --> 01:14:43.825]  Go hold your breath.
[01:14:43.865 --> 01:14:53.007]  And you know, I don't expect us to go after Bush and his handlers right off the bat for running the attacks.
[01:14:53.027 --> 01:14:55.327]  You know, that happens once you indict them, once you arrest them.
[01:14:55.967 --> 01:14:56.287]  No, no, no.
[01:14:56.327 --> 01:15:02.109]  You get them on ordering FBI agents off the trail of who the government claims were the hijackers.
[01:15:02.429 --> 01:15:03.629]  We have them in triplicate.
[01:15:04.795 --> 01:15:12.859]  From Arizona to Illinois, to Texas, to Miami, to California, to Minnesota.
[01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:21.603]  The code breakers, the interpreters, the FBI agents, up on the news saying,
[01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:28.281]  Up on the housetop, on the National Press Club saying, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[01:15:28.561 --> 01:15:30.082]  Here's the letter from John Ashcroft.
[01:15:30.442 --> 01:15:34.604]  All I can tell you is, and then the Bush's vacation with the Bin Laden's.
[01:15:37.905 --> 01:15:41.387]  See that's an FBI agent, that's Robert Wright, who won't sell out.
[01:15:41.427 --> 01:15:47.049]  Who won't just make an excuse and go along and get a bigger paycheck and move up the ladder and get big cash bonuses.
[01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:51.671]  That's somebody upset about 3,000 dead Americans.
[01:15:55.327 --> 01:15:58.008]  But, I mean, let's say that's too hard to go after Bush for.
[01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.129]  How about the trillions missing from the Pentagon?
[01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:01.030]  And get Bill Clinton, too.
[01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.670]  He was involved.
[01:16:03.051 --> 01:16:03.911]  You see, they're buddies.
[01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:04.832]  They work together.
[01:16:05.452 --> 01:16:06.593]  It's them against us.
[01:16:12.755 --> 01:16:17.098]  And then your other comment... John, do you remember what his other two points were?
[01:16:18.178 --> 01:16:19.119]  He had two other questions?
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.201]  Yeah, that scholar kind of dribbles one.
[01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:23.821]  That was another one.
[01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:29.444]  The other question was, uh, Scholar for 9-11 Truth.
[01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:39.227]  You know, I try not, just like I said the other day, other shows that are unfortunately failures, almost all the other Patriot shows aren't, I mean, are not even 1-10th.
[01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:42.467]  In fact, there's no show even 1-10th the audience of this one.
[01:16:44.728 --> 01:16:51.950]  And I wish that wasn't the case, but it's because people don't like to tune in and constantly hear gossip and dirty laundry being aired.
[01:16:53.175 --> 01:17:04.721]  I do not agree with Jim Fetzer on his Directed Energy Weapons Space Beam business, but I'm not trying to get in a fight with people.
[01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:19.368]  And I don't agree, and I think that Professor Jones is acting like a gentleman, and has had some things done to him that aren't right.
[01:17:23.024 --> 01:17:25.346]  But, what does it mean?
[01:17:26.327 --> 01:17:28.849]  I mean, you're talking about legends in people's own minds.
[01:17:28.889 --> 01:17:32.532]  I mean, if I thought I was the end-all be-all of 9-11 Truth, I'd be a legend in my own mind.
[01:17:34.294 --> 01:17:40.018]  You get a bunch of scholars together, 400 and something of them, and you're going to have fights, and you're going to have power struggles.
[01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:42.060]  That happens in any society.
[01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:49.927]  And so now it's broken up, and Jones is starting a new organization that will be peer-reviewed and have a board.
[01:17:50.757 --> 01:17:53.298]  And be transparent and have voting by all members.
[01:17:55.359 --> 01:17:58.199]  And I support that, and that's the way I think things should be done.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.720]  But that's not my fight.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.101]  I don't have a dog in that fight.
[01:18:03.781 --> 01:18:10.043]  Really, the news here isn't about of the... well if it's 84%, I mean we're talking about 230-something million people
[01:18:19.324 --> 01:18:20.785]  Who believe we're being lied to about 9-11?
[01:18:21.565 --> 01:18:23.226]  So why should it be about two individuals?
[01:18:23.246 --> 01:18:27.587]  See, when I talk about 9-11, it isn't, I'm the only one you can trust.
[01:18:28.087 --> 01:18:29.448]  All the other researchers are bad.
[01:18:30.048 --> 01:18:30.728]  Listen to me.
[01:18:30.849 --> 01:18:31.669]  Make me king.
[01:18:32.309 --> 01:18:33.249]  It's, I'm not your leader.
[01:18:33.289 --> 01:18:34.030]  Go out and be leaders.
[01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:35.070]  That's how we're going to win.
[01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.651]  I'm trying to win the war.
[01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:38.271]  Teamwork here.
[01:18:39.012 --> 01:18:43.734]  So, if some people on the sidelines are having fights with each other, I'm not worried about them.
[01:18:43.954 --> 01:18:44.754]  I'm on the field.
[01:18:46.201 --> 01:18:46.422]  Hut!
[01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:46.783]  Hut!
[01:18:46.904 --> 01:18:47.125]  Hut!
[01:18:47.225 --> 01:18:47.988]  Come on, let's go!
[01:18:48.148 --> 01:18:49.272]  Let's move it down the field!
[01:18:49.312 --> 01:18:49.794]  Come on!
[01:18:50.095 --> 01:18:50.817]  Get in the game!
[01:18:53.297 --> 01:18:53.738]  Gold.
[01:18:54.078 --> 01:18:55.379]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:18:55.639 --> 01:19:01.725]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:01.906 --> 01:19:05.729]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:07.972]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:19:08.012 --> 01:19:10.314]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:17.241]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[01:19:17.261 --> 01:19:18.462]  We're good to go.
[01:19:32.298 --> 01:19:38.946]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:19:39.266 --> 01:19:41.889]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.092 --> 01:19:48.196]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:19:48.357 --> 01:19:49.378]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:54.579]  We're good to go!
[01:20:13.908 --> 01:20:15.188]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:20:15.268 --> 01:20:21.149]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:26.430]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:35.432]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:20:35.692 --> 01:20:40.553]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:56.141]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.421 --> 01:21:05.427]  Did you know that the Lennon School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[01:21:06.167 --> 01:21:11.650]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation Chapter 13.
[01:21:13.098 --> 01:21:23.102]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:31.085]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:34.428 --> 01:21:35.048]  Call now.
[01:21:35.068 --> 01:21:37.650]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:53.195]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:21:53.255 --> 01:21:54.056]  What's wrong?
[01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.357]  I am so tired.
[01:21:55.417 --> 01:21:57.918]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.119]  I have tried everything.
[01:21:59.179 --> 01:22:00.940]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.241]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:22:02.361 --> 01:22:04.663]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:22:04.823 --> 01:22:06.384]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:22:06.624 --> 01:22:08.666]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[01:22:08.786 --> 01:22:11.007]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:11.708]  The what?
[01:22:11.988 --> 01:22:14.049]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:19.513]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[01:22:19.693 --> 01:22:20.934]  You can see it at BedFan.com.
[01:22:21.814 --> 01:22:22.935]  How well are you sleeping?
[01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:24.816]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[01:22:25.196 --> 01:22:29.519]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:22:29.759 --> 01:22:33.062]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:36.444]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[01:22:36.804 --> 01:22:37.685]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[01:22:37.905 --> 01:22:39.125]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:22:39.146 --> 01:22:42.388]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:43.929]  The BedFan is the answer.
[01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:45.550]  Visit BedFan.com.
[01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:49.112]  That's Bed F A N dot com.
[01:23:15.515 --> 01:23:29.797]  Yeah, a lot of people would think that if I came out and said, this group's good, that group's bad, all the years I've been savaged and attacked by different organizations, or when other people were fighting with each other, that that somehow is a good thing.
[01:23:31.179 --> 01:23:45.410]  And overall it isn't because it actually just gives more attention to it and then sends people to the negative bilge instead of busy getting informed on what they can prove for themselves and then going out and proselytizing and waking up others.
[01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:49.172]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next here?
[01:23:50.453 --> 01:23:52.655]  Lewis in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:23:53.991 --> 01:23:54.992]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:23:55.232 --> 01:23:55.552]  You bet.
[01:23:55.872 --> 01:23:58.214]  I just wanted to... I just had three items.
[01:23:58.234 --> 01:24:00.335]  I wanted to just run them off real quick.
[01:24:01.096 --> 01:24:12.083]  I just wanted to let you know I was looking into the whole vaccine issue myself and called Merck and I was actually transferred to their National Service Center, they said, for legal reasons.
[01:24:12.764 --> 01:24:13.444]  Whatever that is.
[01:24:14.952 --> 01:24:24.357]  And that they, yeah, like you say, claim that the vaccines no longer have mercury in them, except for one, they've got the guy said, one adult vaccine.
[01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:29.322]  Okay, well I read the AP last week where they admit all the vaccines have it.
[01:24:29.342 --> 01:24:31.623]  What they did was make available lots that don't.
[01:24:31.683 --> 01:24:32.784]  So it's a lawyer lie.
[01:24:32.804 --> 01:24:34.904]  They go, no, no, no, the vaccines don't have mercury.
[01:24:35.224 --> 01:24:46.688]  Well, yes, they have some available in small lots that aren't, but then the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration get sued by families asking them to take the mercury out and they say no.
[01:24:47.408 --> 01:24:54.830]  And then I have the AP reporting they've increased the amount of mercury, and then I have newscasts saying mercury is good for your brain, it's in the vaccines, keep taking it!
[01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:59.392]  Well, regardless, I've made the decision not to vaccinate, Mike, I have a one-year-old.
[01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:13.896]  Hey, look, sir, when you're there looking at the vaccines, just ask the doctor, how dare you ask, let me see the ampule, let me see it before you load it into an injector, into a syringe, and it'll say thimerosal, if it says thimerosal, that is mercury.
[01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:15.610]  Okay, yes, yes.
[01:25:16.471 --> 01:25:17.312]  Just two other points.
[01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:20.077]  I wanted to ask just your quick advice.
[01:25:20.197 --> 01:25:24.544]  I understand, you know, that you're not an expert in my question.
[01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:25.638]  Real estate.
[01:25:25.778 --> 01:25:30.342]  What is a good position to be in as far as that with the expected coming crash?
[01:25:30.502 --> 01:25:33.604]  I can't really give advice on real estate because I own very little myself.
[01:25:33.664 --> 01:25:37.067]  I just have listened and read what the experts have said and have been proven right over time.
[01:25:37.087 --> 01:25:39.069]  You see, I don't just believe somebody when they first say something.
[01:25:39.129 --> 01:25:41.531]  I look at people long term and see their history.
[01:25:42.072 --> 01:25:43.313]  And real estate is so complex.
[01:25:43.373 --> 01:25:45.835]  It depends on your region, where you live, what state.
[01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.024]  It depends on your finances.
[01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:50.106]  It's a very complex situation.
[01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:53.930]  But the establishment a year ago started saying, get out of real estate, get out of real estate, get out.
[01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:55.371]  It's going to bust, it's going to bust.
[01:25:55.691 --> 01:26:03.918]  They were trying to destroy a dollar sink, which was a place where people could put dollars that are being devalued rapidly.
[01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:08.342]  And sure, it's overinflated, but still there was some value in real estate.
[01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:11.065]  So that's why they were trying to destroy a place
[01:26:11.545 --> 01:26:12.285]  I just wanted to ask, or
[01:26:40.382 --> 01:26:45.386]  Ask you, please, explain what keeps you going in the fight.
[01:26:45.486 --> 01:26:49.469]  I know that, like you said before, sometimes you have those spells of depression, knowing what you know.
[01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:55.094]  And also, just give some insight into your source of spiritual power.
[01:26:55.114 --> 01:26:55.194]  Okay.
[01:26:56.975 --> 01:26:57.816]  Sure, thank you for the call.
[01:26:57.836 --> 01:26:59.097]  Those are all interesting questions.
[01:27:00.058 --> 01:27:01.179]  All important questions.
[01:27:01.419 --> 01:27:02.840]  People say, what keeps me going in the fight?
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.081]  Why do I work so hard so much?
[01:27:05.497 --> 01:27:07.620]  I'm committed to winning this fight against the New World Order.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.002]  I know we can defeat them.
[01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:13.447]  It doesn't mean the world's going to be a perfect place, but if you just give in to corruption, it's going to run all over you.
[01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:18.573]  Bullies always tell you you don't have a hope or prayer to beat them.
[01:27:18.873 --> 01:27:22.738]  And more times than not, if you actually just start swinging, they're going to end up going down.
[01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:24.557]  That's my life experience.
[01:27:24.577 --> 01:27:26.678]  It's the same thing with these corrupt people running our government.
[01:27:27.038 --> 01:27:30.940]  They always tell you you don't have any power, because they're a small group that took power.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.082]  And so they know that small groups of people do have power.
[01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.683]  They're actually scared to death of us.
[01:27:35.703 --> 01:27:39.125]  That's why they try to dumb down whole societies.
[01:27:39.165 --> 01:27:43.827]  But more than just trying to win this fight and loving my family, I'm at the point of no return, folks.
[01:27:43.867 --> 01:27:45.128]  It's kind of like I'm in a little boat.
[01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:46.929]  I'm going to the new world.
[01:27:47.369 --> 01:27:49.430]  I've gotten 70% of the way there.
[01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:50.851]  The wind's blowing in the right direction.
[01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:52.692]  I don't have food or water to go back.
[01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:55.643]  So I've reached my point of no return a long time ago.
[01:27:56.843 --> 01:27:59.404]  The safest thing for me to do is stay out in front.
[01:27:59.964 --> 01:28:01.365]  Out in front of everybody.
[01:28:02.105 --> 01:28:04.306]  Out there reaching out to the general population.
[01:28:04.686 --> 01:28:05.946]  Getting other people to wake up.
[01:28:06.026 --> 01:28:10.448]  I mean, the most dangerous position for Alex Jones would be for me to stop doing what I'm doing.
[01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:11.348]  Stop writing books.
[01:28:11.368 --> 01:28:12.288]  Stop making films.
[01:28:12.889 --> 01:28:13.869]  Not being involved.
[01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:17.330]  You know, these whistleblowers all the time think they're safe when they do it in secret.
[01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:18.811]  No, you're dead meat when you do that.
[01:28:20.051 --> 01:28:22.152]  You're safe when you go public.
[01:28:22.292 --> 01:28:22.792]  Or safer.
[01:28:24.068 --> 01:28:34.617]  And overall, as a society, as a species, we're safer when we grow backbones, when we get a spinal transplant, and just go ahead and go into this fight 110%.
[01:28:35.178 --> 01:28:35.498]  Okay?
[01:28:35.878 --> 01:28:36.499]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:40.542]  I'm scared of not fighting these bullets, because I know they're gonna win if I don't fight them.
[01:28:40.802 --> 01:28:41.984]  At least I've got a fighting chance.
[01:28:43.745 --> 01:28:44.646]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:46.748]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.648 --> 01:28:50.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.498 --> 01:28:59.620]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.601]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.881 --> 01:29:08.145]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.445 --> 01:29:14.568]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.828 --> 01:29:16.669]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:29:16.929 --> 01:29:17.349]  I think so.
[01:29:39.444 --> 01:29:40.466]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:42.969]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.989 --> 01:29:43.189]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.209 --> 01:29:43.269]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.115 --> 01:29:54.096]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:29:54.176 --> 01:29:58.939]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:29:59.119 --> 01:30:06.924]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:30:07.184 --> 01:30:12.547]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:30:12.768 --> 01:30:19.732]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:30:20.032 --> 01:30:25.375]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:30:25.635 --> 01:30:30.358]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:30:30.698 --> 01:30:38.282]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:44.888]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:48.732]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:49.072 --> 01:30:49.953]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:52.476 --> 01:30:54.758]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:30:54.838 --> 01:30:57.160]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.685]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:31:02.325 --> 01:31:08.791]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:21.543]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:31:21.983 --> 01:31:25.767]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:31:26.187 --> 01:31:32.248]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer!
[01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:33.089]  Honest!
[01:31:33.469 --> 01:31:38.710]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:41.931]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[01:31:42.311 --> 01:31:43.471]  That's Wristease.
[01:31:43.891 --> 01:31:48.592]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[01:31:48.732 --> 01:31:51.213]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:31:56.002 --> 01:32:02.026]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:02.647 --> 01:32:05.629]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:17.578]  In the last 24 hours, the big telecommunications lobbying consortium globally has announced a bunch of different plans to openly begin shutting down the web.
[01:32:18.678 --> 01:32:21.105]  Good old John McCain, Mr. Keating 5.
[01:32:21.566 --> 01:32:23.431]  Again, he's anti-corruption because he's such a big criminal.
[01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:27.160]  The guy we can trust has come out with a plan to basically start shutting down the web.
[01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.589]  So I thought I'd play this little three-minute clip.
[01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:37.635]  It's audio of an informative video we have up on PrisonPlanet.com that is titled, Save the Internet.
[01:32:37.655 --> 01:32:39.276]  And then I'll quickly go to Danny and skip.
[01:32:39.296 --> 01:32:41.577]  I know we've got a bunch of other callers, but you've been holding the longest.
[01:32:41.838 --> 01:32:47.381]  And we're going to go for the rest of the broadcast to our esteemed guest, who I got a chance to interview Sunday on The Syndicated Show.
[01:32:47.421 --> 01:32:50.443]  I wanted to have her back for more questions because it was so interesting.
[01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:55.707]  And that is Barbara McLeod, anthropologist who worked on Apocalypto.
[01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:59.612]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the Save the Internet.
[01:32:59.652 --> 01:33:00.072]  Here it is.
[01:33:01.332 --> 01:33:06.954]  The way the Internet works today, everyone is connected to each other through the same level playing field.
[01:33:07.714 --> 01:33:11.755]  But a handful of phone and cable companies want to change all that.
[01:33:15.536 --> 01:33:21.798]  They want to lock down parts of the web and make sites pay them more money to use it.
[01:33:22.878 --> 01:33:24.939]  Everyone else will get the slow lane.
[01:33:29.054 --> 01:33:29.935]  How will they do that?
[01:33:31.557 --> 01:33:34.200]  By killing one of the Internet's founding principles.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.902]  Net neutrality.
[01:33:38.424 --> 01:33:39.946]  So what is net neutrality?
[01:33:40.326 --> 01:33:43.029]  I'm not even sure what net neutrality means.
[01:33:46.893 --> 01:33:50.477]  You connect to the web through pipes owned by telephone and cable companies.
[01:33:50.945 --> 01:33:55.406]  But the deal is, they're not allowed to mess with what's inside those pipes.
[01:33:55.666 --> 01:34:01.287]  Whether it's Google or Yahoo, Lonely Girl or Bill O'Reilly, everyday citizens or business tycoons.
[01:34:01.887 --> 01:34:05.528]  Everybody's website gets the same speed and quality.
[01:34:06.268 --> 01:34:08.549]  That's called net neutrality.
[01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:10.249]  So, what's the debate?
[01:34:10.289 --> 01:34:11.510]  That actually seems quite fair.
[01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:13.670]  Yes, almost too fair.
[01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:17.391]  It's as though the richer companies get no advantage at all.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:24.344]  The companies want to set up a restricted fast lane on the internet, but only for their partners and services.
[01:34:24.905 --> 01:34:30.589]  Only sites who pay them a huge fee would be allowed to use it, making them gatekeepers.
[01:34:36.613 --> 01:34:47.221]  This is really a debate over monopoly versus the ideas of even the smallest person being given access to every person in our country.
[01:34:48.234 --> 01:34:49.515]  That's what the genius of the Internet was.
[01:34:49.756 --> 01:34:54.780]  That it made the first amount of a living document again for millions of Americans for whom it had lost its meaning.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.624]  But this wide open access could be slipping through our fingers.
[01:34:59.044 --> 01:35:02.247]  It happened, remember, to television, radio, and cable.
[01:35:02.788 --> 01:35:04.289]  It could happen to the Internet.
[01:35:12.757 --> 01:35:15.818]  Protestors are asking for help to defend internet freedom.
[01:35:16.018 --> 01:35:20.220]  The group SaveTheInternet.com delivered thousands of signed petitions.
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.621]  With a single refrain, save our internet.
[01:35:23.981 --> 01:35:32.825]  Every day as more and more citizens learn about the issue of net neutrality, they realize that the internet as they know it is very much at risk.
[01:35:33.465 --> 01:35:36.466]  SaveTheInternet.com is turning the tide in this battle.
[01:35:36.926 --> 01:35:41.148]  Exploding to over 800 groups from across the political spectrum.
[01:35:43.965 --> 01:35:53.308]  Artists, internet celebrities, and over 1 million internet users like us who petitioned Congress to protect net neutrality.
[01:35:53.988 --> 01:36:01.050]  Together we blocked an attack in the Senate in 2006 and sent dozens of internet freedom fighters to the new Congress.
[01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:07.612]  But the gatekeepers are launching a counterattack on Washington and on your state legislature.
[01:36:07.773 --> 01:36:12.374]  We need to raise the alarm now to make neutrality the law in our new Congress.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.383]  Man the battle stations at SaveTheInternet.com.
[01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:28.768]  To sign the petition, call your congresspeople, and share this message with friends.
[01:36:29.169 --> 01:36:34.234]  And stay tuned for our plan to build a faster, more open, and accessible internet in 2007.
[01:36:35.375 --> 01:36:38.518]  Use the internet to save the internet at SaveTheInternet.com.
[01:36:44.088 --> 01:36:50.210]  And yes, man your battle stations, man the guns in the info war, as I have said over and over again.
[01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:53.251]  Understand, you pay exorbitant prices.
[01:36:53.411 --> 01:36:56.913]  I mean, it's huge profits when you connect with your internet service company.
[01:36:57.493 --> 01:37:00.914]  They then pay for all the bandwidth that they send out.
[01:37:00.974 --> 01:37:02.134]  They're sending out your data.
[01:37:02.154 --> 01:37:03.415]  They're paying for all of that.
[01:37:04.133 --> 01:37:05.635]  And then it goes on down the line.
[01:37:05.655 --> 01:37:07.576]  They're paying that phone company to tie in.
[01:37:07.817 --> 01:37:08.678]  They're making money.
[01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:13.863]  The phone companies get up and lie and say, we need to start shutting this down and not let people do this.
[01:37:13.943 --> 01:37:18.927]  And their other big scam is the Internet's dying because there's too much traffic on it.
[01:37:19.948 --> 01:37:27.476]  But at their actual big consortium meetings in Chicago and Austin and London in the last three years, and we've covered their minutes each year, just typing the Internet is dead.
[01:37:27.516 --> 01:37:28.477]  That's what they always announce.
[01:37:29.424 --> 01:37:38.915]  They say they're going to shut down the hubs, shut down the systems, and make the old internet, the real internet, fail and then force you on the internet too.
[01:37:39.295 --> 01:37:42.258]  So they've got a bunch of different strategies in here to do this.
[01:37:42.298 --> 01:37:49.186]  To charge for emails, to charge if you're able to get around on the internet, just to go through their hubs when you're already paying for it.
[01:37:49.958 --> 01:37:54.502]  But also, just to start, it's kind of like they built toll roads right next to the existing roads.
[01:37:55.062 --> 01:38:03.969]  And just like in the real toll road agreements here in Texas with Sintra, they have agreements where if they don't make enough money on their new toll roads, they can shut down our roads to force them to use their roads.
[01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:05.730]  Well, that's what they're doing here.
[01:38:06.711 --> 01:38:08.492]  And we raised this alarm many years ago.
[01:38:08.572 --> 01:38:09.633]  People finally get it.
[01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:11.454]  They finally know.
[01:38:11.474 --> 01:38:14.637]  I mean, we write articles two, three years ago saying they're attacking the net.
[01:38:14.657 --> 01:38:15.377]  They want to shut it down.
[01:38:15.397 --> 01:38:17.419]  People are like, sure, Jones, sure.
[01:38:17.739 --> 01:38:18.500]  Just like when I
[01:38:20.413 --> 01:38:21.834]  Broke the Building 7 story.
[01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:24.215]  We were always talking about it since the afternoon of 9-11.
[01:38:24.856 --> 01:38:27.157]  And then some folks found the clip and put it on a little website.
[01:38:27.177 --> 01:38:27.818]  We picked it up.
[01:38:27.978 --> 01:38:29.439]  It went supernova on the web.
[01:38:29.739 --> 01:38:34.922]  And I remember other talk show hosts on Genesis calling me and going, This Building 7, we don't know.
[01:38:35.062 --> 01:38:36.203]  Alex, you're out on a limb.
[01:38:36.263 --> 01:38:37.583]  You know, you're being uncredible.
[01:38:37.824 --> 01:38:40.385]  And now it's just accepted knowledge that they blew up Building 7.
[01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:43.367]  And Silverstein's quote is what he said.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:50.102]  And so we try to trailblaze here, and I'm not tooting my horn, hey we trailblazed on this, we trailblazed on that.
[01:38:50.582 --> 01:38:52.562]  I'm just telling you folks, you should really listen to us.
[01:38:53.102 --> 01:38:54.623]  I mean, it's as bad as we're saying.
[01:38:55.083 --> 01:38:56.383]  Okay, I don't have words.
[01:38:56.403 --> 01:39:01.765]  I mean, do you think they're just going to let us make the newspapers go out of business?
[01:39:01.865 --> 01:39:04.525]  Do you think they're just going to let us destroy national television?
[01:39:04.545 --> 01:39:08.126]  Do you think they're just going to let us take over mainstream radio?
[01:39:08.627 --> 01:39:09.307]  Because we are.
[01:39:10.487 --> 01:39:10.987]  No, no, no, no.
[01:39:11.267 --> 01:39:13.668]  The existing order is fighting back.
[01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:14.988]  All right?
[01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:17.170]  We're all for free market.
[01:39:17.210 --> 01:39:22.514]  We think they should be able to be on the web, do what they want, unobstructed, because we believe in the market of ideas we can win.
[01:39:22.614 --> 01:39:23.975]  We're ready to actually play.
[01:39:24.396 --> 01:39:25.817]  But see, they want to tie our hands.
[01:39:25.837 --> 01:39:33.923]  It's like a football game where they go, okay, now we're going to break one of your feet, we're going to tie one of your hands behind your back, and now you can get on the field and play with us.
[01:39:34.284 --> 01:39:34.444]  No!
[01:39:36.118 --> 01:39:37.238]  All right, I said I'd go to these calls.
[01:39:37.278 --> 01:39:38.579]  My guest is sitting here patiently.
[01:39:39.359 --> 01:39:41.979]  Let's just very quickly go to two callers that I promised I'd go to.
[01:39:41.999 --> 01:39:44.260]  Then we'll go to our guests for the rest of the transmission.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.220]  Let's talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:46.800]  You're on the air.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:47.221]  Go ahead.
[01:39:47.241 --> 01:39:48.701]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:49.561]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:39:49.581 --> 01:39:53.242]  I'd like to start off just by saying happy birthday to my mom.
[01:39:53.262 --> 01:39:54.262]  I'm a five-year listener.
[01:39:54.522 --> 01:39:55.102]  Fantastic.
[01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:55.582]  Good.
[01:39:56.042 --> 01:39:56.803]  Happy birthday, Mom.
[01:39:57.643 --> 01:39:58.783]  Thanks, man.
[01:39:59.043 --> 01:40:02.704]  Also, I wanted to just ask for more people in Hollywood.
[01:40:03.248 --> 01:40:11.631]  If they know what's going on, you know, if they're aware of what's going on and have questions about 9-11 to come out, you know, start a group for, you know, Hollywood for 9-11 Truth or something.
[01:40:11.751 --> 01:40:12.972]  It's come out all at once.
[01:40:14.032 --> 01:40:17.534]  Then, two quick questions in closing, if you could touch on these, Alex.
[01:40:18.694 --> 01:40:23.516]  One was about Boeing, how these debunkers are trying to use Boeing of the columns.
[01:40:23.536 --> 01:40:26.517]  They're trying to debunk, you know, like loose change.
[01:40:26.537 --> 01:40:30.539]  You know, I've seen a debate with Burmess, Avery, and Mark Roberts.
[01:40:31.553 --> 01:40:36.177]  And he tried to attack, like, Steven Jones and, you know, the whole idea of Thermite and all that.
[01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:38.398]  I was wondering if you could touch on that real quick.
[01:40:39.139 --> 01:40:42.201]  And also, I was wondering whatever happened with Laurel Chavez.
[01:40:42.962 --> 01:40:43.962]  It was very interesting.
[01:40:43.982 --> 01:40:45.243]  You had him come out once.
[01:40:45.764 --> 01:40:46.945]  He was an interesting guest.
[01:40:47.505 --> 01:40:50.227]  And then he got slammed and attacked and he didn't want to go public anymore.
[01:40:50.667 --> 01:40:52.229]  Let me answer your other question quickly.
[01:40:52.249 --> 01:40:52.909]  I've got to let you go.
[01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:55.631]  You were asking about...
[01:40:57.325 --> 01:41:00.527]  The popular mechanics type people and others that come out.
[01:41:00.927 --> 01:41:02.928]  First the government said fire made the steel melt.
[01:41:03.608 --> 01:41:07.430]  Then they said fire weakened the steel and made it buckle and fall and pancake.
[01:41:08.031 --> 01:41:09.191]  But they don't ever want to talk about Building 7.
[01:41:10.112 --> 01:41:16.895]  Underwriting laboratories that underwrote the buildings looked at Tower 1, 2, and 7 and said that fire couldn't do that.
[01:41:17.255 --> 01:41:23.899]  The firefighters on record, and we have video of it, said it was like a foundry, pools of molten steel gushing
[01:41:24.665 --> 01:41:25.967]  Now, you think jet fuel does that?
[01:41:26.047 --> 01:41:26.427]  It doesn't.
[01:41:26.467 --> 01:41:29.891]  It burns at well below a thousand degrees what it takes to even weaken steel.
[01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:40.583]  You have people standing in the holes where the hottest fires were burning, and they're not melting, but giant four-foot-round steel columns are melting to where it was like a foundry.
[01:41:40.603 --> 01:41:44.407]  The firefighters said it was columns just gushing liquid steel.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.120]  Okay?
[01:41:46.461 --> 01:41:47.722]  It doesn't start melting.
[01:41:48.322 --> 01:41:55.948]  Steel doesn't start melting till 2,754 degrees to 3,300, depending on the type of steel.
[01:41:56.108 --> 01:41:58.430]  Just type steel melt temp into Google.
[01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:01.252]  You'll get University Studies.
[01:42:02.093 --> 01:42:02.373]  Okay?
[01:42:02.693 --> 01:42:04.014]  2,700 and something to 3,300.
[01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:05.876]  That's the range!
[01:42:06.196 --> 01:42:07.557]  Not 1,800 jet fuel.
[01:42:08.097 --> 01:42:10.539]  Okay, then they claim pancake, and they said, well, it weakened the steel.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.882]  Oh, and caused it to all explode and be sheared off perfectly and to melt.
[01:42:14.455 --> 01:42:15.196]  It's impossible.
[01:42:15.456 --> 01:42:23.744]  Then you got seven hit by no plane, hit by no building, and just magically with a CIA based in it, blows up and falls perfectly.
[01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:24.785]  Okay?
[01:42:25.386 --> 01:42:27.628]  Quickly, skip in California, then we go to our guest.
[01:42:27.648 --> 01:42:28.069]  Go skip.
[01:42:30.051 --> 01:42:37.198]  Yes, I have a... I don't know how to make a webpage myself, but I have an idea and everyone I told it to thinks it needs to be out there.
[01:42:37.398 --> 01:42:38.159]  Okay, what's your idea?
[01:42:38.988 --> 01:42:47.353]  Alright, there should be a webpage out there that basically, in layman terms, breaks down everything, all the executive orders, like 1100 or 1010990 that
[01:42:52.136 --> 01:42:53.117]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.558]  Yes.
[01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:57.199]  Well, it says in plain language.
[01:42:57.219 --> 01:42:58.340]  You can read the executive order.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.262]  We can put you in FEMA camps, put you in slave labor camps.
[01:43:01.282 --> 01:43:02.583]  I mean, it's all in the executive orders.
[01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:10.968]  Well, my idea is to have something there that breaks it down really simple for anybody to see and then has a link to the page where you can see it for yourself.
[01:43:11.128 --> 01:43:15.991]  I've actually written an article and others have written articles where they do show executive orders and break them down.
[01:43:16.531 --> 01:43:17.232]  That's been done.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.181]  Well, what about something that hits everything?
[01:43:21.221 --> 01:43:22.482]  The Military Commissions Act?
[01:43:22.682 --> 01:43:23.623]  I'd love to hit everything.
[01:43:23.763 --> 01:43:24.363]  I'd love to.
[01:43:24.903 --> 01:43:26.024]  No, I'm not saying you.
[01:43:26.084 --> 01:43:28.665]  Any listener out there, put something together.
[01:43:28.685 --> 01:43:30.586]  Someone that does know how to make a webpage.
[01:43:31.727 --> 01:43:38.090]  Yeah, no, you can put a lot of the stuff out there, but new things happen faster than you could ever even read them, much less analyze them and post them.
[01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:40.311]  That's the problem with tens of millions of laws.
[01:43:40.612 --> 01:43:41.192]  Great idea.
[01:43:41.272 --> 01:43:41.912]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:41.952 --> 01:43:42.573]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:44.761 --> 01:43:52.640]  The reason I've spent a couple of segments on different shows talking about this is because I'm just a minor buff, you know, been down to
[01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:57.511]  Some of the Mayan and Aztec ruins in Southern North America.
[01:43:57.991 --> 01:44:00.132]  Watch the Discovery Channel shows like everybody else.
[01:44:00.532 --> 01:44:01.713]  Read a few books on the subject.
[01:44:01.733 --> 01:44:02.613]  My mom took history.
[01:44:02.653 --> 01:44:03.453]  She studied some of it.
[01:44:03.813 --> 01:44:06.314]  So when I was a kid, I got drug around quite a few of these.
[01:44:06.774 --> 01:44:14.517]  And I remember the tour guides and the archaeologists and the people and the books I read, you know, saying they sacrificed tens of thousands depending on which tribe it was.
[01:44:15.217 --> 01:44:24.361]  Saying that this went on for thousands of years, and reporting how they skinned people and ripped their jaws out and tortured them, and how they took hallucinogenic drugs and did all this stuff.
[01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:32.324]  And then Mel Gibson makes Apocalypto, and for condensing all these different cultures together into two and a half hours, I thought it was pretty darn accurate.
[01:44:32.344 --> 01:44:33.665]  It certainly wasn't perfect.
[01:44:34.185 --> 01:44:38.567]  And then I saw crazy articles, like this one out of the Statesman, but there were a lot of them.
[01:44:38.587 --> 01:44:39.267]  This was in Austin.
[01:44:39.667 --> 01:44:42.408]  Apocalypto is an insult to Mayan culture, one expert says.
[01:44:42.888 --> 01:44:44.089]  And then she gives no evidence.
[01:44:44.958 --> 01:44:51.405]  It's this Julia Guernsey, I guess you pronounce it, and we find one of the crazier quotes here.
[01:44:51.425 --> 01:44:54.168]  It says, you just hate the movie, the reporter said.
[01:44:54.308 --> 01:44:54.729]  I hate it.
[01:44:55.309 --> 01:44:56.050]  I despise it.
[01:44:56.150 --> 01:44:56.991]  That's very intellectual.
[01:44:57.972 --> 01:44:58.893]  I think it's despicable.
[01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:00.375]  Three ad homonyms.
[01:45:01.135 --> 01:45:03.876]  It's offensive to Mayan people, not the ones we've talked to, folks.
[01:45:04.216 --> 01:45:12.758]  It's offensive to those of us who try to teach cultural sensitivity and alternative worldviews that might not match our own 21st century Western ones, but are nonetheless valid.
[01:45:12.798 --> 01:45:13.718]  It's nonetheless valid.
[01:45:14.178 --> 01:45:16.219]  And then I actually pulled out her three quotes here.
[01:45:17.479 --> 01:45:22.841]  She said that the human sacrifice was valid, pious act, and done with solemnity.
[01:45:24.441 --> 01:45:24.721]  Okay.
[01:45:25.746 --> 01:45:30.853]  I'm not against Mesoamerican people, but I'm not against Romans of today either.
[01:45:32.535 --> 01:45:35.857]  By the end of it, I mean, sometimes thousands of people in a week would die.
[01:45:35.877 --> 01:45:38.778]  They would just run the circus, you know, 12 hours a day.
[01:45:38.798 --> 01:45:41.559]  And this was more of a stylized murder.
[01:45:41.959 --> 01:45:49.002]  And by the end, they were throwing babies, women into wild animals, just mass killing, burning people on pyres, burning Christians.
[01:45:49.803 --> 01:45:53.745]  Sometimes they'd conquer a city, salt the earth, and kill half the population.
[01:45:53.785 --> 01:45:56.806]  I mean, those are real, written-down Josephus accounts.
[01:45:57.583 --> 01:46:03.088]  And so if I talk about the barbarous behavior of what humans do over and over again, this is the norm, not the exception.
[01:46:03.369 --> 01:46:13.398]  Mass sacrifice, fires, burning, war, murder, piles of dead bodies, bloodletting, hallucinating, priests, sacrificing animals, guts spilling out everywhere.
[01:46:13.418 --> 01:46:15.780]  I mean, that is the norm.
[01:46:16.201 --> 01:46:20.665]  Humans have this desire, have this taste, have this drive, and so when I talk about
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:27.542]  The bog people of Ireland, they find all the nobles with their brains bashed out and their throats slit in the peat bogs.
[01:46:27.822 --> 01:46:31.563]  When I talk about all of that, I'm not bashing the Irish.
[01:46:32.063 --> 01:46:39.064]  But boy, you talk about the Mayan, you talk about the Aztecs, you talk about these different cultures down there, they will get mad.
[01:46:39.104 --> 01:46:43.045]  They will get mad in a hurry because you're not allowed to talk about this.
[01:46:43.065 --> 01:46:44.486]  You're just an evil right-winger.
[01:46:44.546 --> 01:46:45.406]  You're just a racist.
[01:46:45.466 --> 01:46:45.746]  No, no, no.
[01:46:46.026 --> 01:46:48.947]  The Nazis had a culture of killing and murdering and skulls and death.
[01:46:49.634 --> 01:46:53.937]  And I can say I disagree with that culture and think it was pretty darn out of control and decadent and evil.
[01:46:54.557 --> 01:46:58.920]  And whenever they come at me with that, I come back at them with the Nazi thing and they go, oh yeah.
[01:46:59.541 --> 01:47:02.363]  So I just don't get her vicious attack on Mel Gibson.
[01:47:02.383 --> 01:47:05.945]  She says, first he went after the Jews, now he's done with them, he's going after the Mayans.
[01:47:06.405 --> 01:47:09.668]  Though this film had a lot of Mayans in it, Mayans that have seen it like it.
[01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:14.911]  We've got, and we're going to break and come right back to her, Barbara McLeod on with us.
[01:47:16.636 --> 01:47:16.796]  I think?
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.381]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.960]  Oh, no, no, that's great.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:55.541]  That's good.
[01:47:55.721 --> 01:48:02.362]  When you came into the KLBJ studio for the Sunday Syndicated Show from 4 to 6, I didn't know that you actually listened to the show.
[01:48:02.663 --> 01:48:08.264]  I mean, I knew you'd emailed us some comments about Apocalypto defending it that we posted last week, but I didn't know.
[01:48:08.284 --> 01:48:10.765]  I was kind of being, well, you know what we do here, kind of.
[01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:11.985]  I didn't want to scare you off.
[01:48:12.005 --> 01:48:14.206]  And then, no, no, you are a listener.
[01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:15.766]  She knows what you do here.
[01:48:19.188 --> 01:48:19.608]  You bet!
[01:48:21.230 --> 01:48:24.273]  What are some of the things we can talk about in the next hour and ten minutes when we get back?
[01:48:24.534 --> 01:48:38.249]  Well, you've already kicked it off with the idea of human bloodlust, and I would like to zero in on how some of that bloodlust is channeled into rights of animal sacrifice and human sacrifice, which are also very, very common.
[01:48:38.849 --> 01:48:41.290]  In religions around the world, including our own.
[01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:53.354]  And I think we should talk about just types of sacrifice and how different cultures deal with this and how that ties into how the Aztecs and the Maya chose to deal with it.
[01:48:54.155 --> 01:49:00.417]  And to maybe push it ahead into an idealization of how do we deal with this bloodlust?
[01:49:00.457 --> 01:49:05.759]  How do we channel it in a way that creates peace and harmony and contains it?
[01:49:06.717 --> 01:49:08.858]  And I have some ideas about that.
[01:49:09.118 --> 01:49:13.139]  Also, you've got some of the speeches from the film.
[01:49:13.339 --> 01:49:13.640]  I do.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.380]  We'll read them in English and then in, is it Yucatec?
[01:49:16.641 --> 01:49:17.881]  This is Yucatec Maya.
[01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:20.662]  It's a language that in the past I've spoken fluently.
[01:49:20.682 --> 01:49:23.803]  I'm a little rusty at it now, but my pronunciation is still good.
[01:49:23.863 --> 01:49:25.003]  I've taught it for 10 years.
[01:49:25.344 --> 01:49:29.025]  I've taught bare bones beginners to speak this language quite well.
[01:49:29.985 --> 01:49:33.830]  And I've got some speeches here from Apocalypto because I worked on it.
[01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:36.153]  We'll also tell some Mel Gibson stories that are pretty interesting.
[01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:38.415]  On the other side, folks, stay with us.
[01:49:38.595 --> 01:49:40.417]  Barbara McLeod is our guest.
[01:49:40.998 --> 01:49:43.561]  We're honored to have us here in studio with us today.
[01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:49.868]  Coast to coast, border to border, talking about interesting subjects, trying to inform the population about the nature of man.
[01:49:49.888 --> 01:49:50.329]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.636 --> 01:49:59.777]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.137 --> 01:50:02.058]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:10.120]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:17.843]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.243 --> 01:50:25.125]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:29.640]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.501]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.921 --> 01:50:35.862]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.182 --> 01:50:40.123]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:59.728 --> 01:53:02.790]  Barbara McLeod is our guest here in studio.
[01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:07.092]  Out of the gates, I want to talk about what you did on the film so people get an idea about that.
[01:53:07.192 --> 01:53:14.777]  First off, I was just thinking, not only is Mel Gibson and myself, anybody that talks about the Mayans doing human sacrifice, the Aztecs,
[01:53:15.365 --> 01:53:17.106]  You know, either it doesn't exist or we're evil.
[01:53:17.127 --> 01:53:17.747]  We'll talk about it.
[01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:27.915]  I've had the modern occultists, I guess kind of the druid type folks, the pagans, email me, call me and go, there was no human sacrifice in Europe either.
[01:53:27.955 --> 01:53:28.856]  You're lying.
[01:53:29.396 --> 01:53:30.417]  It's a Christian lie.
[01:53:31.018 --> 01:53:31.518]  No, no, no, no.
[01:53:31.558 --> 01:53:32.579]  They admit all this.
[01:53:32.599 --> 01:53:35.041]  They dig up the bodies.
[01:53:35.401 --> 01:53:36.362]  In Europe, it's admitted.
[01:53:36.602 --> 01:53:38.704]  Humans did this all over the world.
[01:53:39.124 --> 01:53:42.087]  Why do you think human sacrifice is global?
[01:53:43.228 --> 01:53:44.629]  Well, I think first of all,
[01:53:45.569 --> 01:53:47.890]  Humans as a species do have a bloodlust.
[01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:53.712]  And there are various ways in which that can be expressed and channeled in the community.
[01:53:53.752 --> 01:53:55.813]  And it's one of the issues for every culture.
[01:53:55.833 --> 01:54:00.335]  How to channel it in such a way that it doesn't backfire on the community itself.
[01:54:00.415 --> 01:54:02.235]  Now it's sports and war.
[01:54:02.375 --> 01:54:04.196]  Sports and war are one way to do it.
[01:54:04.316 --> 01:54:07.377]  You know, if you've got somebody to go to war with, then you've got a way to channel it.
[01:54:08.718 --> 01:54:14.220]  But whether or not you've got somebody to go to war with, there have to be other ritualized ways of channeling it.
[01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:24.170]  And one of the more common ones that I won't say it's absolutely universal, but it's common in cultures around the world that have to our knowledge have had no contact with each other.
[01:54:25.504 --> 01:54:45.509]  It's the idea of scapegoating someone or picking someone of the community or something in the community on which all the sins of the community can be heaped and then that is ritually sacrificed as an offering to God or the gods and it helps to purge the community of sin.
[01:54:45.609 --> 01:54:46.950]  That's what they do at Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:52.011]  They do a mock sacrifice and they say we're putting all our cares, all our problems on this voodoo doll.
[01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:55.813]  Right, and that idea is a very common one.
[01:54:55.893 --> 01:54:58.533]  I would say it's one of those archetypal motifs.
[01:54:58.573 --> 01:55:02.274]  Why do you think those old men at Bohemian Grove, I was in the crowd, they were taking it very serious.
[01:55:02.294 --> 01:55:05.215]  They were very solemn and, yeah, kill them, get them, get them.
[01:55:05.235 --> 01:55:07.576]  It was just an effigy, but they were getting off on it.
[01:55:08.136 --> 01:55:17.458]  Well, they've, I assume, I mean you were there, so I can only guess that they've already been drawn into the ritual atmosphere that
[01:55:18.513 --> 01:55:20.214]  Ritual creates sacred space.
[01:55:21.594 --> 01:55:30.658]  One goes into that sacred space in a formal way and you put certain aspects of yourself aside and you take on certain other aspects of yourself.
[01:55:31.599 --> 01:55:32.819]  You take on a new identity.
[01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:37.481]  You may put on a robe or put on those Boy Scout uniforms or whatever it is that they're wearing.
[01:55:39.417 --> 01:55:49.841]  And you take on a new personality and so solemnity, if that's part of the ritual, solemnity is going to be, you know, it's going to be consolidated by the community in that sacred space.
[01:55:49.901 --> 01:55:52.482]  So it literally spreads from person to person, the attitude.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:53.721]  Absolutely.
[01:55:53.941 --> 01:56:05.234]  Yeah, it's something that they're also trained to do, that they learn in the process of becoming initiated into that, that they set aside certain aspects of themselves as they go into that sacred space.
[01:56:05.274 --> 01:56:09.279]  Yeah, Mike Hanson was going, oh, I like this, and we're all looking at him, and Mike was like, oh, this is nice!
[01:56:09.859 --> 01:56:12.520]  I was like, Mike, no, no, look, they're all real serious.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:12.900]  Right.
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.120]  Amazing.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.521]  Okay, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:28.924]  We have plenty of time coming up in the next segments, but just give us an idea of your training first, and then we'll come back, talk about how you got involved in Apocalypto, and then go into the film itself, then into the wider aspects of anthropology.
[01:56:29.628 --> 01:56:31.949]  Well, I have a PhD in Anthropology.
[01:56:32.029 --> 01:56:35.769]  I've been studying the Maya for about 35 years.
[01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:40.350]  And I did my initial training at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:47.292]  I wasn't a Mayanist at that time, but while I lived in Seattle, I made my first trip down to the Maya area to explore caves.
[01:56:47.812 --> 01:56:51.032]  I was very seriously into cave exploring for many years before that.
[01:56:51.993 --> 01:56:57.994]  And so I jumped into cave exploring in Belize and started finding Maya artifacts in all the caves.
[01:56:58.474 --> 01:56:59.135]  We're good to go!
[01:57:13.777 --> 01:57:27.561]  Went back, finished up my degree in anthropology, went into the Peace Corps, and was hired by the Archaeology Department of the country to study caves and to help develop national park programs as well as... Stop right there!
[01:57:27.601 --> 01:57:30.442]  We'll finish up when we get back and then get into Apocalypto with our guest.
[01:57:33.443 --> 01:57:38.464]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.432 --> 01:57:50.073]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.733 --> 01:57:51.774]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.494 --> 01:57:53.595]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.256 --> 01:57:55.096]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.837 --> 01:57:56.737]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.757 --> 01:58:01.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.581 --> 01:58:05.684]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.504 --> 01:58:12.028]  Barbara McLeod is our guest in this third and final hour today on this Thursday edition.
[01:58:12.048 --> 01:58:13.089]  We'll be live tomorrow.
[01:58:13.549 --> 01:58:15.571]  We'll be live Christmas Eve on the Sunday show.
[01:58:16.727 --> 01:58:26.529]  We're talking about the film Apocalypto and the Mayanists, that's the people that study it, I guess the subdivision of anthropology, who got upset by the film and then claim that the Mayan didn't like it.
[01:58:26.569 --> 01:58:30.150]  Though, the Mayans we've talked to and that my guests have talked to did like the film.
[01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:41.012]  And it's as accurate as you can get trying to condense all these different cultures into, I guess you could say, a two and a half hour film.
[01:58:44.074 --> 01:58:47.297]  And Barbara McLeod, who's an anthropologist, is here with us.
[01:58:47.317 --> 01:59:06.551]  She was telling us how she got into caving, how she got into anthropology, and she was continuing and then leading up to getting involved in Apocalypto, what she did there in the post-production, trying to make sure that they got the language just right, and later she'll be speaking in that language with us.
[01:59:06.571 --> 01:59:07.292]  So please continue.
[01:59:08.291 --> 01:59:18.499]  Okay, well, I think that I got into the Maya through my very strong interest in caving and my exposure to these wonderful caves down in Belize.
[01:59:19.339 --> 01:59:23.943]  And I came back after that first trip down there as a Peace Corps volunteer.
[01:59:24.623 --> 01:59:30.988]  My job was to study the caves for the archaeology department, help them develop a national parks program,
[01:59:31.924 --> 01:59:36.727]  And also report back to the archaeology department about the artifacts that I was finding in caves.
[01:59:37.288 --> 01:59:39.029]  So that was a wonderful exposure.
[01:59:39.609 --> 01:59:46.134]  And it also allowed me to have firsthand evidence for human sacrifice, because the caves are full of it.
[01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:56.771]  So after five years of this kind of work, I moved to Austin and went to graduate school and got a master's degree and then a PhD in anthropology.
[01:59:57.632 --> 02:00:05.542]  And I started out in archaeology, but I actually slid over onto the linguistic side of the fence because I've always been very, very interested in languages and
[02:00:06.175 --> 02:00:08.016]  The Mayan languages fascinated me.
[02:00:08.096 --> 02:00:11.537]  I had a lot of exposure to different speakers of Mayan languages in Belize.
[02:00:11.577 --> 02:00:15.238]  Haven't you pioneered a lot of discoveries and developments now with your knowledge of the language?
[02:00:15.518 --> 02:00:16.298]  I have.
[02:00:17.018 --> 02:00:21.380]  Not only in the studies of the languages, but also in the studies of the hieroglyphs.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:27.542]  Because I was one of the early pioneers in the linguistic approach to hieroglyphic decipherment.
[02:00:27.942 --> 02:00:32.123]  Identifying the little bits and pieces of affixes
[02:00:32.571 --> 02:00:35.494]  That's been what's most fascinated me.
[02:00:53.322 --> 02:01:03.208]  I'm, of course, very, very interested in what they said, but it's how they said it that really excites me the most, because that's my frontier, and that's my major contribution.
[02:01:03.288 --> 02:01:07.911]  Who is this art teacher at UT that's so mad at Mel Gibson?
[02:01:08.491 --> 02:01:09.672]  Well, you know her, you told me.
[02:01:09.692 --> 02:01:11.693]  I do know her, actually, and she's a friend of mine.
[02:01:12.174 --> 02:01:19.178]  We haven't had a chance to talk about Apocalypto, and sparks might fly if we did, but I suppose maybe there'll be an opportunity in the future.
[02:01:20.293 --> 02:01:22.756]  No, she's very serious about her study of the Maya.
[02:01:22.776 --> 02:01:23.897]  She's got a lot of experience.
[02:01:24.318 --> 02:01:25.299]  She's an art historian.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:34.751]  She was a graduate student here at UT and she's kind of come up through the ranks and studied with a lot of well-known expert people and now she's a professor here at UT.
[02:01:35.749 --> 02:01:39.212]  But it seems what she's saying is, I just don't like the view this gives.
[02:01:39.232 --> 02:01:41.453]  She doesn't really say anything he's doing is inaccurate.
[02:01:41.573 --> 02:01:47.298]  Oh, well, a cave drawing they show is from an earlier period with a head being chopped off and blood spewing.
[02:01:47.518 --> 02:01:50.020]  She doesn't deny it isn't from that whole culture down there.
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:55.644]  She just nitpicks, you know, how he took, he had to condense these cultures together in two and a half hours.
[02:01:55.684 --> 02:02:00.027]  You know, I mean, you can't show 3,000 years of history in two and a half hours.
[02:02:00.919 --> 02:02:06.682]  Well, you can't even take a chronological slice of history all from one period and show it all in two and a half hours.
[02:02:06.722 --> 02:02:07.862]  There's just too much to do.
[02:02:08.702 --> 02:02:20.047]  And I think my sense of it, not having talked to Julia directly, is that what she's most reacting to, her knee-jerk reaction, is to the violence, that she personally can't stomach it.
[02:02:20.868 --> 02:02:26.710]  But that's like the pagans who call me and say there wasn't human sacrifice in Europe.
[02:02:27.391 --> 02:02:30.152]  Our religion doesn't have that at its roots, and I'm sorry it does.
[02:02:30.934 --> 02:02:32.275]  And I'm just tired of denial.
[02:02:32.315 --> 02:02:34.117]  And this is childlike denial.
[02:02:34.157 --> 02:02:35.038]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:35.098 --> 02:02:35.898]  Long segment coming up.
[02:02:35.919 --> 02:02:37.320]  Plenty of time to get into Apocalypto.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.963]  Mel Gibson, deeply involved in the film, obviously.
[02:02:41.003 --> 02:02:43.105]  She'll tell you some behind-the-scenes stories as well.
[02:02:48.234 --> 02:02:48.694]  It's here!
[02:02:48.914 --> 02:02:53.697]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.057 --> 02:03:01.721]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.381 --> 02:03:09.445]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.845 --> 02:03:16.689]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.222 --> 02:03:21.286]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.566 --> 02:03:25.049]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.529 --> 02:03:27.431]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.791 --> 02:03:31.715]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.694 --> 02:04:46.955]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:04:46.975 --> 02:04:49.395]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:04:49.455 --> 02:04:53.977]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.

[02:05:46.423 --> 02:05:52.468]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:56.111]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.674 --> 02:06:05.980]  Governments of men and women, more often than not, engage in mass human sacrifice by war, by the great arena.
[02:06:07.427 --> 02:06:10.512]  ...by huge prisons and public executions.
[02:06:11.153 --> 02:06:12.315]  That's a form of sacrifice.
[02:06:12.335 --> 02:06:17.423]  There is no doubt the Iraq War, and I've said this many times, is a form of sacrifice.
[02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:20.147]  In fact, I've read, going back to the Hundred Year War between the French and British...
[02:06:20.726 --> 02:06:28.174]  Where the Royals are all cousins and they're riding to each other saying, we've got problems with our economy, we've got uprisings, let's have a war.
[02:06:28.554 --> 02:06:36.642]  Where it's spelled out they're having wars, as George Orwell said in 1984, really against their own populations more than it is against a neighbor.
[02:06:36.682 --> 02:06:40.326]  It's a way of unifying the tribe, getting their minds off ideas,
[02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:44.728]  Because elites know that the average person wants to wage war, even subconsciously.
[02:06:44.908 --> 02:06:45.768]  Wants to move up.
[02:06:46.048 --> 02:06:46.908]  Wants to take over.
[02:06:47.128 --> 02:06:48.029]  Wants to be dominant.
[02:06:48.249 --> 02:06:49.309]  Some people more than others.
[02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:54.751]  And so they use wars as a way to channel that energy out of the country against a foreign enemy.
[02:06:54.951 --> 02:07:09.317]  In fact, you were telling me off air last time we spoke about you guys talking to Mel Gibson, talking and, you know, discussions of, this is just like, and he also said that on national television, this is like human sacrifice over in Iraq and what's happening there.
[02:07:10.549 --> 02:07:16.471]  Well, he did express that opinion several times as we were going through the work in the sound studio.
[02:07:17.231 --> 02:07:27.795]  We didn't have an opportunity to talk about it at length because we're just taking short breaks, but he truly believes that the war in Iraq is a kind of profane mass sacrifice.
[02:07:29.838 --> 02:07:30.879]  Well, and look at our leaders.
[02:07:30.899 --> 02:07:32.419]  Look at Bush and Skull and Bones.
[02:07:32.539 --> 02:07:33.700]  This is serious ritual.
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.740]  Look at Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:39.722]  In fact, I have a mainstream news article today about huge secret societies that are now discovering all over the western world.
[02:07:39.983 --> 02:07:48.886]  Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, wrote in his autobiography, Men and Powers, that, oh, I do rituals at a grove in Germany, but I love doing the rituals in California.
[02:07:48.906 --> 02:07:49.947]  That's my favorite place.
[02:07:50.487 --> 02:08:04.316]  Why do you think there's this need, especially in people that seek real power, to be involved in so much ritual, i.e., even if it's like Anton LaVey, I was watching a video clip of him the other day, and he said, oh, we don't really kill people here at the Church of Satan, we do mock sacrifices.
[02:08:05.156 --> 02:08:05.857]  Very interesting.
[02:08:06.877 --> 02:08:14.422]  Well, I think whether you do mock sacrifices or real sacrifices, one of the primary purposes of ritual is to consolidate power.
[02:08:15.737 --> 02:08:17.459]  I mean, you do it through magic.
[02:08:17.819 --> 02:08:30.431]  You do it through bringing power in from elemental sources, and you use magic to consolidate and concentrate it and channel it toward the desires of the community.
[02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:33.734]  Well, I mean, that's my point, and that's why you're here and we appreciate you being here.
[02:08:33.774 --> 02:08:35.195]  It's not just about Apocalypto.
[02:08:35.536 --> 02:08:45.205]  Mel Gibson, you know, in his films, tries to point out real things that have happened or, you know, to take real things and consolidate them into, you know, some type of fantasy realm so it's more easily understood.
[02:08:45.785 --> 02:08:55.895]  But sacrifice and mock sacrifice and all enrichable runs our society, but somehow in modern Western culture, you're laughed at like you're crazy if you even talk about it existing.
[02:08:57.119 --> 02:09:06.264]  Well, I think it's clear that it did exist worldwide and that in large measure human sacrifice does seem to have faded.
[02:09:06.925 --> 02:09:08.906]  I can't promise that it's not going on somewhere.
[02:09:09.586 --> 02:09:17.751]  But we have a lot of evidence that in times past, a century ago, and certainly a thousand years ago, there was a lot of it going on.
[02:09:18.611 --> 02:09:21.733]  And I mentioned one purpose of it and another purpose of it
[02:09:22.848 --> 02:09:30.596]  I think it's just simply that a lot of people conceive of the relationship with God or gods as being one of giving and taking.
[02:09:30.997 --> 02:09:35.522]  That if they ask the deities for something, they give something in return.
[02:09:36.743 --> 02:09:41.609]  And a lot of people do believe that that something has to be something precious and valuable
[02:09:41.994 --> 02:09:46.896]  And the closer it is to one's own flesh and blood, the better, the more valuable it is.
[02:09:46.936 --> 02:09:49.457]  Well, it's like I'm a Christian and every night before dinner we say a prayer.
[02:09:49.537 --> 02:09:50.738]  I'm thanking God for the food.
[02:09:50.878 --> 02:09:51.358]  That's right.
[02:09:51.438 --> 02:09:54.679]  Well, I think that that is a spiritualization of that relationship.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:59.981]  What I'm talking about in sacrifice, we're talking about, I think, two concepts.
[02:10:00.481 --> 02:10:03.503]  One is concrete and the other is spiritual.
[02:10:03.803 --> 02:10:06.504]  You concretize something or you spiritualize something.
[02:10:06.804 --> 02:10:09.905]  You're going to have a concretization of this relationship.
[02:10:10.185 --> 02:10:11.786]  You physically give something.
[02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:14.971]  So it's making the spiritual realm real.
[02:10:15.111 --> 02:10:16.412]  It's bringing it into the real world.
[02:10:17.392 --> 02:10:18.793]  And I guess giving your own blood.
[02:10:18.913 --> 02:10:19.874]  Giving your own blood.
[02:10:19.994 --> 02:10:24.157]  I mean, here's an example from the Native American traditions is the Sundance.
[02:10:24.237 --> 02:10:25.237]  You might be familiar with it.
[02:10:25.297 --> 02:10:26.338]  The Lakota Sundance.
[02:10:26.358 --> 02:10:26.598]  Yes.
[02:10:26.938 --> 02:10:31.841]  Where they dance around the pole, hook themselves by the chest with eagle talons.
[02:10:31.861 --> 02:10:32.542]  And get hauled up.
[02:10:32.722 --> 02:10:33.703]  Dance around the poles.
[02:10:33.723 --> 02:10:38.606]  They either get hauled up or they just simply dance and pull back on the pole until the claw pulls loose.
[02:10:38.726 --> 02:10:42.028]  Or they take strips of flesh off their arms.
[02:10:42.475 --> 02:10:48.480]  And it's an offering of one's own flesh, blood, and suffering to God for the sake of the community.
[02:10:48.521 --> 02:10:50.382]  It's a purification, isn't it?
[02:10:50.462 --> 02:10:54.126]  It is a type of purification, but it's for the benefit of the whole community.
[02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:57.909]  Don't they stop it once they have an hallucination or a vision?
[02:10:58.209 --> 02:10:59.130]  Not necessarily.
[02:10:59.691 --> 02:11:01.032]  I don't know the whole detail of it.
[02:11:01.092 --> 02:11:04.735]  First of all, women don't participate in it, but I have known some dancers.
[02:11:04.795 --> 02:11:06.417]  I've talked to some dancers about it.
[02:11:07.297 --> 02:11:16.800]  And I mean, one of the reasons that they did it during the Vietnam War was so that their own Indian people who were over there in Vietnam could come home safely, not be killed.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:20.281]  That they did it in order to have blessings upon their soldiers.
[02:11:20.661 --> 02:11:23.682]  So they use it for all kinds of reasons to serve the community.
[02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:32.044]  Now this is something that I say, you know, if you're going to give something of yourself, well, that's a different story than taking the life of something else.
[02:11:33.176 --> 02:11:34.778]  But they share a commonality.
[02:11:35.018 --> 02:11:36.800]  It's this idea of giving something precious.
[02:11:37.381 --> 02:11:43.047]  And so I think human sacrifice and animal sacrifice originated with this idea of giving something precious.
[02:11:43.548 --> 02:11:50.716]  If you look at the story of Abraham and Isaac, for example, Abraham was asked by God to give the most precious thing of all.
[02:11:50.936 --> 02:11:51.737]  And that was his son.
[02:11:51.957 --> 02:11:52.718]  His firstborn son.
[02:11:54.929 --> 02:12:01.132]  And it was a test, because when push came to shove, then a substitution was made.
[02:12:01.152 --> 02:12:06.834]  There was a ram caught in a thicket, and Abraham was told by an angel that the ram would serve as a substitution.
[02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:12.973]  I think that that was the charter for animal sacrifice in the ancient Hebrew tradition.
[02:12:13.233 --> 02:12:19.799]  We were talking earlier about Jesus on the cross really ending what we think of as, at that point, modern human sacrifice.
[02:12:19.819 --> 02:12:22.722]  Then it was modern, with his final sacrifice.
[02:12:23.182 --> 02:12:26.565]  Well, in the ritual sense of human sacrifice, yes, absolutely.
[02:12:26.646 --> 02:12:30.269]  I think that people who become Christians and who truly embrace
[02:12:31.178 --> 02:12:40.905]  Jesus Christ as their Savior and really, really transfer that bloodlust that they have to that expiation that goes with Christ's death on the cross.
[02:12:41.726 --> 02:12:45.289]  No longer have that bloodlust or want to channel it toward human sacrifice.
[02:12:45.349 --> 02:12:57.078]  Now, this may be stepping on a few toes, but if you look at the Crusades or you look at the Inquisition, you can see that even a church built around this very pure and beautiful idea
[02:12:57.523 --> 02:13:03.468]  Well, I think it's about the cult of power that Orwell writes about in 1984, where O'Brien's torturing Winston, and he says, we are the priests of power.
[02:13:03.568 --> 02:13:06.190]  And really, I think human sacrifice, once it grew from just
[02:13:24.384 --> 02:13:24.805]  We're good to go.
[02:13:40.802 --> 02:13:47.404]  Well, and I still think that there's an important line to be drawn between giving something directly of oneself, one's own person, one's own body.
[02:13:47.884 --> 02:13:49.564]  You can do it through ascetic practices.
[02:13:49.604 --> 02:13:59.347]  You can do it through the sweat lodge, for example, which is something I've participated in where you go and sit with the community people and just sweat and sweat and sweat until you can hardly stand it anymore.
[02:13:59.667 --> 02:14:01.207]  And you pray and smoke the pipe.
[02:14:01.688 --> 02:14:04.908]  And there is a tradition within the sweat lodge of giving flesh as well.
[02:14:04.948 --> 02:14:07.069]  I've never done that, but I understand it.
[02:14:08.271 --> 02:14:13.772]  I think that that's on one side of the line and taking the life of something else is on the other side.
[02:14:14.153 --> 02:14:17.133]  And yet I do see that there's a bridge between them psychologically.
[02:14:17.513 --> 02:14:21.014]  And I understand how one is a step away from the other.
[02:14:21.394 --> 02:14:28.496]  How did it develop from all your studies from the societies 4 or 5 thousand years ago in Mesoamerica?
[02:14:28.776 --> 02:14:32.317]  How did it grow up to the Aztecs sacrificing thousands at a pop?
[02:14:32.765 --> 02:14:40.067]  Well, I can only guess that it's just, you know, when bloodlust still exists and it cannot be spiritualized.
[02:14:40.127 --> 02:14:55.030]  In other words, the tradition is simply to maintain it concretized and as the population grows and as the need grows, and here we have a situation of a very large population, in the case of the Aztecs, an expansionist population.
[02:14:55.070 --> 02:14:57.451]  I mean, they were, you know, they were into empire building.
[02:14:58.058 --> 02:14:59.359]  They wanted to conquer territory.
[02:14:59.399 --> 02:15:00.560]  They wanted to conquer other people.
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.522]  And empires tend to be the most bloody societies.
[02:15:02.542 --> 02:15:07.766]  They wanted to take tribute from everywhere that they could conquer or make their influence known.
[02:15:08.766 --> 02:15:11.028]  And so their needs grew as well.
[02:15:11.949 --> 02:15:20.536]  And in the case of very large populations, who are very dependent upon sunshine and rain to grow their crops.
[02:15:20.576 --> 02:15:26.140]  Friendly relationships between themselves and the supernatural is more and more vital.
[02:15:26.559 --> 02:15:32.904]  As the population gets larger and larger, because they become more vulnerable to any failure of those things.
[02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:47.696]  So if you have, for example, a drought and too much sun, the crops dry up, and you don't look at it as a scientific issue, but you look at it as a out of balance supernatural issue, then you're going to have to come up with some solution that propitiates the gods.
[02:15:47.756 --> 02:15:49.117]  And I really think that it's got to be
[02:15:49.955 --> 02:15:51.656]  Tied into that in some way.
[02:15:51.716 --> 02:15:59.439]  Sounds like global warming being caused by the sun, but they're going to tell us it's being caused by cars and give us a global tax, which has nothing to do with stopping global warming.
[02:16:00.459 --> 02:16:14.205]  Well, my personal view about global warming, and I don't consider myself an expert, is that there must be a very strong natural underpinning to it, but there's no doubt that we also contribute to it as human beings, because
[02:16:14.972 --> 02:16:19.295]  Human beings are, you know, we're... But a lot more than cars is just impervious cover.
[02:16:20.016 --> 02:16:20.216]  Yep.
[02:16:20.236 --> 02:16:22.398]  I mean, the heat sink of concrete.
[02:16:22.698 --> 02:16:23.198]  Absolutely.
[02:16:23.278 --> 02:16:24.720]  And that's just scientific studies.
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:42.013]  And it's also what we do to our rivers, you know, just as an aside from global warming, it's what happens in the way that we develop rivers such that when we do get a lot of rain, then those rivers are out of control because the rainwater doesn't have a chance to soak into the surrounding
[02:16:42.978 --> 02:16:43.759]  We're good to go.
[02:16:59.151 --> 02:16:59.711]  Absolutely.
[02:16:59.731 --> 02:17:01.152]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[02:17:01.172 --> 02:17:04.955]  When we get back, let's get into Apocalypto, what you did, making sure that the language is correct.
[02:17:04.975 --> 02:17:09.218]  I want to go over some of that language, and then I know there's several other issues you want to discuss.
[02:17:09.598 --> 02:17:12.680]  Also, I want to talk about the Mayans that did see this film.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:18.244]  Mel Gibson showed it to Mayan groups, he showed it to Native American groups, he showed it to diverse groups, and they liked it!
[02:17:19.044 --> 02:17:21.366]  And didn't seem bad.
[02:17:21.406 --> 02:17:22.847]  Didn't think it was showing them as bad.
[02:17:23.687 --> 02:17:28.871]  You know, just thought that it was showing a culture and then showing different elements of that culture.
[02:17:29.311 --> 02:17:32.673]  And then we'll discuss the parts that are accurate, the parts that you think are inaccurate.
[02:17:33.053 --> 02:17:36.555]  On the other side of this, quick break with Barbara McLeod, our guest.
[02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:39.197]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:39.217 --> 02:17:42.979]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:45.490 --> 02:17:50.953]  Ted Anderson for Midas December 21st 2006 gold 621 21 ounce gold coins are at 640 76 322 93 for half 161 47 for quarter ounce coins at 640 76 322 93 and 161 47
[02:18:00.978 --> 02:18:02.839]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[02:18:02.919 --> 02:18:03.739]  Fiat currency.
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:08.361]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:18:08.681 --> 02:18:10.562]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:18:11.302 --> 02:18:15.304]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:18:15.324 --> 02:18:17.324]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:18:17.504 --> 02:18:20.906]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:18:20.926 --> 02:18:26.308]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:18:26.468 --> 02:18:27.768]  Could government let this happen?
[02:18:27.888 --> 02:18:29.849]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:18:30.129 --> 02:18:37.174]  Midas has Nick Bereshef's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold oil relationship.
[02:18:37.194 --> 02:18:38.935]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[02:18:38.995 --> 02:18:40.156]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[02:18:40.176 --> 02:18:40.476]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.859 --> 02:18:46.620]  Terrorism!
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.520]  Terrorism!
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:53.685]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:18:53.945 --> 02:18:55.546]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:18:55.786 --> 02:18:58.268]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:18:58.668 --> 02:19:13.238]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:13.258 --> 02:19:13.579]  government.
[02:19:13.759 --> 02:19:15.540]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.845]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:21.985 --> 02:19:26.469]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:19:48.679 --> 02:19:54.226]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism?
[02:19:54.246 --> 02:20:02.837]  That our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America and one day we would wake up and have socialism communism and not even know how it happened?
[02:20:03.613 --> 02:20:08.054]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[02:20:09.034 --> 02:20:13.655]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism, communism, and don't even know it.
[02:20:14.256 --> 02:20:16.036]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.
[02:20:16.676 --> 02:20:24.398]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:44.904 --> 02:20:46.506]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:20:46.826 --> 02:20:55.437]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:20:55.777 --> 02:21:01.504]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:21:01.904 --> 02:21:09.331]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:21:09.672 --> 02:21:15.037]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.

[02:22:03.223 --> 02:22:14.246]  Before this hour ends, in about 36 minutes, we will take just a few calls that are specifically about Apocalypto, or about anthropology at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:15.286 --> 02:22:18.427]  But specifically on topic, on issue, please, callers.
[02:22:18.947 --> 02:22:20.767]  Barbara McLeod, anthropologist, worked on Apocalypto.
[02:22:20.807 --> 02:22:23.548]  Let's get into Apocalypto, and let's get into some of the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[02:22:24.548 --> 02:22:28.569]  Okay, well, first of all, I worked on Apocalypto this fall.
[02:22:29.592 --> 02:22:37.114]  My first trip to Los Angeles was in the middle of September, and my fourth trip was at the beginning of November.
[02:22:37.914 --> 02:22:48.237]  And I know they wrapped up all of their post-production stuff about the middle of November, and I was on call here in Austin during that period, until they actually turned it all over to Disney, who distributed it.
[02:22:48.298 --> 02:22:49.578]  So they went right up to the wire.
[02:22:49.718 --> 02:22:53.319]  They sure did, and I think that they would have liked to have more time.
[02:22:53.746 --> 02:23:01.508]  So they were really scrambling during that last phase, and we were doing 10-12 hour days during that period, because there was just so much to be done.
[02:23:01.828 --> 02:23:06.349]  They brought in all the principal actors, brought them in from all over.
[02:23:06.869 --> 02:23:15.591]  A lot of them were living in Canada or elsewhere in the United States, and they had everybody in, including Rudy Youngblood, who is the star of the film.
[02:23:16.031 --> 02:23:17.232]  And he's from Texas.
[02:23:17.292 --> 02:23:18.812]  He's originally from Belton, Texas.
[02:23:19.272 --> 02:23:20.612]  Now he's living in Los Angeles.
[02:23:20.753 --> 02:23:22.553]  Most of the folks are from Mexico.
[02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:26.495]  Uh, there's a lot of them from Mexico, but there's several of them who are living in Canada.
[02:23:26.555 --> 02:23:28.716]  Toronto's... Like Zero Wolf, a really scary guy.
[02:23:28.776 --> 02:23:31.117]  He's, uh... Rahul Trujillo lives in Toronto.
[02:23:31.377 --> 02:23:32.358]  I'm pretty sure it's Toronto.
[02:23:32.638 --> 02:23:33.618]  He's really, he's good.
[02:23:33.818 --> 02:23:34.599]  He's very good.
[02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:37.700]  He's been in a number of other films playing Native American people.
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:44.443]  He was in New World, and he was in Black Robe, which was a really interesting film that came out about, I don't know, 20 years ago now.
[02:23:45.543 --> 02:23:47.784]  And, uh, and, you know, they're all really great people.
[02:23:47.824 --> 02:23:52.886]  I had a great interaction with all the principal actors, and I really like and respect them all.
[02:23:54.063 --> 02:24:00.468]  Then they brought in a lot of other actors, people that just, you know, hired for a show to come in and do voiceovers.
[02:24:00.648 --> 02:24:03.831]  And this is Mel Gibson going back and trying to get the language just right.
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:07.260]  Doing the best he can to get the language just right.
[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:17.803]  Now, I was there to try to nitpick about the language, and if it had been my druthers, I would have nitpicked a little more, but we were dealing with a serious time constraint.
[02:24:18.303 --> 02:24:28.865]  But my job, since they were doing overdubs anyway, and the main reason was not so much that the language wasn't pronounced correctly, but that they had bad audio from the original production.
[02:24:29.614 --> 02:24:37.282]  And some of it had to do with the fact that there was just distortion or noise on top of the dialogue that they couldn't get out.
[02:24:37.442 --> 02:24:38.163]  They were out in the jungle.
[02:24:38.203 --> 02:24:45.310]  They had a speedboat nearby in one case when they were filming some of the critical dialogue and they just couldn't, they couldn't wipe it out.
[02:24:45.350 --> 02:24:46.131]  They couldn't get rid of it.
[02:24:47.232 --> 02:24:53.438]  Or they just had bad audio or in some cases they didn't feel, Mel didn't feel that they had adequate emotion.
[02:24:54.088 --> 02:25:01.496]  In the voice that he was really I was fascinated with his attention to the emotional quality of this film in every respect.
[02:25:02.076 --> 02:25:08.002]  And he was very, very, very on top of everything that was said and how it was said.
[02:25:08.083 --> 02:25:13.808]  And, you know, and we would sit there and go through these scenes or watch these scenes 10, 15, 20 times.
[02:25:15.751 --> 02:25:20.372]  Well, the actors would overdub those lines again and again and again.
[02:25:21.313 --> 02:25:24.334]  And first of all, they would have to lip-sync them.
[02:25:24.354 --> 02:25:31.336]  And there's a method in ADR, Automatic Dialogue Replacement, where they cue you so that you know when you start.
[02:25:31.896 --> 02:25:35.277]  And it's visual and auditory, the method that they use to cue people.
[02:25:35.317 --> 02:25:39.358]  Of course, people that have a lot of acting experience are good at lip-syncing.
[02:25:39.918 --> 02:25:43.441]  But then they can digitize it and lock it in more precisely.
[02:25:43.481 --> 02:25:45.562]  It's very interesting to have audio digital and video digital.
[02:25:45.582 --> 02:25:46.063]  Yeah, you can't tell.
[02:25:46.083 --> 02:25:46.763]  They did a great job.
[02:25:46.963 --> 02:25:47.864]  They did a great job.
[02:25:47.904 --> 02:25:48.424]  They really did.
[02:25:48.484 --> 02:25:52.967]  But what he wanted to see and feel was the emotion in the voice.
[02:25:53.448 --> 02:25:57.471]  And that was the primary reason that we repeated and repeated and repeated.
[02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:01.013]  Is that he was just there thinking, hmm, that's too flat.
[02:26:01.273 --> 02:26:02.534]  Or that's too loud.
[02:26:02.654 --> 02:26:04.576]  Or that doesn't quite fit with the
[02:26:06.832 --> 02:26:10.653]  Emotional tenor of... Listen, I don't think Stanley Kubrick could have made this film.
[02:26:10.753 --> 02:26:11.994]  It is extremely powerful.
[02:26:12.034 --> 02:26:12.874]  I took some friends to it.
[02:26:12.894 --> 02:26:13.854]  I've seen it twice now.
[02:26:13.874 --> 02:26:16.175]  And they said, yes, this was total immersion.
[02:26:16.755 --> 02:26:19.236]  And plus it's shot in this new super high digital quality.
[02:26:19.496 --> 02:26:20.416]  It's not film, folks.
[02:26:20.796 --> 02:26:23.557]  And I mean, you really get... Yeah, you really get immersed in this.
[02:26:24.426 --> 02:26:35.795]  So, I was there giving linguistic cues and helping people, since we were overdubbing anyway, helping people improve the pronunciation, get some of those glottalized consonants in there.
[02:26:36.216 --> 02:26:37.817]  And also, we were adding some lines.
[02:26:39.198 --> 02:26:41.180]  There were a number of lines that were added off camera.
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:48.406]  If actors were not facing the camera, then we could have them saying new things that kind of helped to fill in some gaps in the story.
[02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:53.529]  And I should also say that I was working with a young Yucatec man who lives in Los Angeles.
[02:26:53.889 --> 02:26:55.310]  His name was Nicolás Pot.
[02:26:56.091 --> 02:26:58.772]  And Nicolás and I, I think we became friends.
[02:26:58.832 --> 02:26:59.413]  We hit it off.
[02:26:59.453 --> 02:27:00.854]  We really liked working together.
[02:27:01.354 --> 02:27:03.535]  And so, I consider us a team.
[02:27:03.555 --> 02:27:06.437]  It was Barb McLeod and Nicolás Pot, or vice versa.
[02:27:06.757 --> 02:27:10.820]  We were the Yucatec language consultant team for the ADR.
[02:27:11.664 --> 02:27:12.305]  Well, stay there.
[02:27:12.325 --> 02:27:32.579]  We're going to break, and I want to come back, and you're going to read two different scenes or sub-parts of scenes directly from the script in English, then in Yucatec, and this is amazing stuff, and then some more behind-the-scenes stories about the post-production of the film Apocalypto, still number one in the theaters, last time I checked, going into its third week.
[02:27:35.561 --> 02:27:36.461]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.942 --> 02:27:38.443]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.438 --> 02:27:42.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.924 --> 02:27:52.349]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:52.769 --> 02:27:57.533]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:57.913 --> 02:28:00.556]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:01.036 --> 02:28:04.379]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:05.197 --> 02:28:09.520]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:13.143]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?

[02:32:28.174 --> 02:32:38.869]  All my interviews in studio, like the one you're hearing right now, all the local TV shows, my book, Paul Watson's book, all 15 of my films, in super high bandwidth down to low bandwidth for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:32:39.169 --> 02:32:40.551]  Be sure and take advantage of that now.
[02:32:42.003 --> 02:32:50.247]  Going back to my guest, and then we do have a few callers here that we'll be able to go to who are on topic as well, Demetrius and Bill and others.
[02:32:50.467 --> 02:33:04.794]  Let's continue with getting into the film, and then also some of the criticisms by some of the liberal anthropologists, if you want to call them that, criticizing Gibson, saying it's too violent, it's scary, when in your letter you wrote to us,
[02:33:05.314 --> 02:33:09.836]  Countering them, you said he didn't show them ripping people's jaws off in ritual torture.
[02:33:09.896 --> 02:33:12.456]  He didn't show, you know, a lot of the things.
[02:33:13.257 --> 02:33:17.858]  I mean, is it accurate that they stuck people's heads on these poles, Barbara?
[02:33:18.618 --> 02:33:22.100]  Well, there certainly is some evidence that they did things like that, that they piled them up.
[02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:28.142]  I mean, we've got archaeological evidence of platforms that are completely embellished with carved skulls.
[02:33:29.742 --> 02:33:32.203]  And I've seen, from the work that I've done in caves,
[02:33:32.779 --> 02:33:37.243]  Piles of skulls that were undoubtedly decapitation sacrifices.
[02:33:38.204 --> 02:33:39.805]  And you can see that in the vertebra of the chop.
[02:33:40.025 --> 02:33:40.546]  Absolutely.
[02:33:40.826 --> 02:33:41.367]  Absolutely.
[02:33:42.087 --> 02:33:46.271]  And you find the rest of the body with no head lying around in the cave elsewhere.
[02:33:46.331 --> 02:33:48.072]  I've seen some places like this.
[02:33:48.153 --> 02:33:53.177]  In fact, in the case of that cave, I was the first person to see all of this stuff and document it.
[02:33:53.669 --> 02:33:56.970]  I actually found the pile of skulls that they had walled off in the corner.
[02:33:57.130 --> 02:34:01.090]  Now you told a story Sunday on the show about Mel Gibson sitting there getting his hair cut.
[02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:03.691]  He's about to go to a TV interview and there's a young girl cutting his hair.
[02:34:03.711 --> 02:34:06.592]  She didn't get sick seeing the heart chopping thing over and over again.
[02:34:06.612 --> 02:34:07.132]  Tell that story.
[02:34:07.332 --> 02:34:11.853]  Well, he had to get his hair cut before the first Diane Sawyer interview.
[02:34:12.773 --> 02:34:14.773]  It looked fine to me, but he felt it was too long.
[02:34:14.893 --> 02:34:19.734]  So he had his personal hair cutter come into the studio while he was doing his directing.
[02:34:20.634 --> 02:34:21.955]  We did not take a break for it.
[02:34:22.355 --> 02:34:23.495]  He just kept right on working.
[02:34:24.133 --> 02:34:27.354]  And she showed up and came in with all her toolkit.
[02:34:28.234 --> 02:34:30.875]  And the first thing he does is start strutting around.
[02:34:30.915 --> 02:34:33.056]  He has a hard time sitting still anyway.
[02:34:33.116 --> 02:34:34.236]  He's just a high-energy guy.
[02:34:34.656 --> 02:34:40.938]  He takes off his shirt with a flourish and struts around in the studio with his shirt off, which I thought was just great, you know?
[02:34:41.118 --> 02:34:42.019]  He's about to get his hair cut.
[02:34:42.059 --> 02:34:43.179]  Yeah, he's about to get his hair cut.
[02:34:43.219 --> 02:34:46.460]  And she has this lovely black cape that makes me think of Zorro.
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:51.822]  And so he grabs this cape and wraps it around himself as he's strutting around and the cape is floating.
[02:34:52.486 --> 02:34:54.228]  Floating and swirling and swishing.
[02:34:54.688 --> 02:35:03.857]  And then he sits down in the chair and she's cutting his hair as we are working through the scene with the high priest upon the temple ripping people's hearts out.
[02:35:04.838 --> 02:35:08.681]  And of course in that scene you don't actually see the cut.
[02:35:08.962 --> 02:35:11.104]  What you see is the knife falling.
[02:35:11.524 --> 02:35:14.127]  You hear the victim gurgling and screaming.
[02:35:14.147 --> 02:35:15.888]  You know the media called this the most violent ever.
[02:35:15.928 --> 02:35:16.589]  This is nothing!
[02:35:17.338 --> 02:35:22.201]  They certainly could have made it worse, and there's a lot of Hollywood stuff out there that is visually much more shocking.
[02:35:22.221 --> 02:35:24.642]  Oh yeah, where they show the apocalypto.
[02:35:25.222 --> 02:35:35.167]  I think they really toned it down, and as you mentioned, there are cases of ritual torture that we know about that are documented for the ancient Maya that were not shown in the film at all.
[02:35:35.207 --> 02:35:37.469]  They could have made it a lot more graphic than they did.
[02:35:37.749 --> 02:35:41.591]  Well, the point I'm making though, from that story, is that the young girl cutting his hair didn't get upset.
[02:35:42.797 --> 02:35:45.920]  She certainly didn't miss a step in what she was doing.
[02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:47.321]  She was watching what was going on.
[02:35:47.381 --> 02:35:58.470]  She's also looking obviously at Mel's head, so she doesn't do a bad job, but she was completely exposed to the whole thing and just carried on.
[02:35:58.690 --> 02:36:00.532]  Can we tell the story about the parrot?
[02:36:01.332 --> 02:36:03.794]  Don't say what he said, or maybe we shouldn't.
[02:36:04.055 --> 02:36:05.136]  He didn't make the film.
[02:36:05.476 --> 02:36:07.658]  There was going to be a parrot in the film.
[02:36:07.678 --> 02:36:10.100]  There is a parrot in the film, actually, but all he does is go...
[02:36:10.856 --> 02:36:11.977]  Or something like that, you know.
[02:36:12.017 --> 02:36:16.379]  But he was going to say something else that is connected to the arrest.
[02:36:16.439 --> 02:36:17.079]  And I'm not sure.
[02:36:17.359 --> 02:36:20.681]  I can tell you what it was in Yucatec that the parrot was going to say.
[02:36:20.701 --> 02:36:23.022]  And that anybody out there that knows Yucatec could figure out what it was.
[02:36:23.042 --> 02:36:23.122]  Okay.
[02:36:23.142 --> 02:36:23.682]  The word is Ch'hook'eem.
[02:36:23.702 --> 02:36:23.942]  Ch'hook'eem.
[02:36:23.982 --> 02:36:30.145]  And it was going to go, Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[02:36:30.205 --> 02:36:30.985]  Chooking!
[02:36:31.346 --> 02:36:31.926]  Chooking!
[02:36:51.134 --> 02:36:53.836]  Um, Mel said, well, you know, you didn't see any of this stuff.
[02:36:53.877 --> 02:36:56.118]  This was, uh, this was all, you know, secret stuff.
[02:36:56.158 --> 02:37:02.924]  And I kind of chimed in and said, yeah, right, you didn't see any, any heads rolling down the steps or hearts being offered to the gods and things like that.
[02:37:02.964 --> 02:37:03.904]  And she just kind of laughed.
[02:37:03.964 --> 02:37:05.406]  And then we all laughed about it.
[02:37:05.446 --> 02:37:07.147]  Everybody that was in the room laughed about it.
[02:37:12.398 --> 02:37:21.603]  I mean, it's no secret that Mel Gibson, his dad, has been on the show and the family's come to some of the events.
[02:37:21.663 --> 02:37:27.306]  I've met a lot of the family, but obviously Mel Gibson in a Playboy interview on The Tonight Show talked about the New World Order.
[02:37:27.326 --> 02:37:28.947]  He's made films about the New World Order.
[02:37:29.427 --> 02:37:32.229]  I mean, Mel Gibson knows all about the New World Order, but not just Mel Gibson.
[02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:37.172]  You said that on the set there was a lot, you know, just in the side discussions about the New World Order.
[02:37:37.799 --> 02:37:38.560]  There was a little bit.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:41.082]  There wasn't time for a lot of anything.
[02:37:41.102 --> 02:37:43.204]  I guess the stories you told me sounded like a lot.
[02:37:43.604 --> 02:37:50.029]  There wasn't a lot, but it was enough to get a sense of how Mel feels about things.
[02:37:50.510 --> 02:38:06.663]  One of the other things that I contributed to, which ended up not being in the film, was that after the captives were taken and tied to those bamboo poles so they could be marched, do that forced march through the forest for a couple of days, I suggested that maybe we should have them shouting
[02:38:07.267 --> 02:38:12.910]  Curses and things at these people are obviously, you know, out to really screw them over.
[02:38:13.111 --> 02:38:15.632]  I mean, they've already devastated the village, killed half the people.
[02:38:16.212 --> 02:38:29.280]  And so I helped, Nicolas and I kind of collaborated and came up with a bunch of curses, you know, things that mayas say to one other when they're, either when they're joking around or when they're truly angry at one another.
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:31.982]  And so we cooked up a bunch of these things in Yucatec.
[02:38:33.204 --> 02:38:39.909]  Before we read these, I also wanted to ask about the different screenings that were shown to Mayim.
[02:38:39.929 --> 02:38:44.733]  Just to wrap it up, I think that once they laid the score down, they decided that they couldn't really use that material.
[02:38:45.934 --> 02:38:57.144]  There were other things that I helped to develop that ended up not being used, and I really think it has to do with just the competition with the score, and they decided that the score should just dominate.
[02:38:57.304 --> 02:38:58.625]  And it's already a jam-packed movie.
[02:38:59.085 --> 02:38:59.946]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:59.986 --> 02:39:02.887]  I mean, it's just sumptuous visually and auditorily.
[02:39:03.267 --> 02:39:06.989]  There's no empty space in it at all.
[02:39:07.690 --> 02:39:16.194]  And that's one of the things that's so stimulating about it, and I think that's one of the things that has, in fact, angered the people who don't like it, is because they still are sucked into it.
[02:39:16.374 --> 02:39:17.775]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:17.855 --> 02:39:22.497]  I mean, I've been on my TV show, and we've been talking about the Aztecs cutting out hearts, the Mayans.
[02:39:22.537 --> 02:39:23.958]  I get a call going, you're a liar!
[02:39:23.978 --> 02:39:25.539]  That's colonial propaganda!
[02:39:25.859 --> 02:39:36.841]  They didn't do that, but I've been to Chichen Itza with a ball playing court with hundreds of skulls carved in, and the Mayan, you know, archaeology professor who's giving the big tour says, oh yes, of course they killed, blah, blah, blah.
[02:39:37.021 --> 02:39:40.122]  But then you get up here and there's almost like a cover-up going on.
[02:39:40.502 --> 02:39:48.444]  Well, I haven't read Julia's article in a while, it's been a few days, but she does mention, I believe... No, no, no, she doesn't.
[02:39:48.464 --> 02:39:49.504]  I'm talking about other people.
[02:39:49.524 --> 02:39:52.665]  But there are other people, I mean, I know there are people out there who try to deny it.
[02:39:54.326 --> 02:39:55.007]  What can I say?
[02:39:55.027 --> 02:40:03.733]  But then you've got a t-shirt from a big meeting you guys had and I mean it's got heart chopping right on the cover with some green demon coming out.
[02:40:03.893 --> 02:40:08.696]  This is straight out of one of the Maya Screenfold books from the post-classic.
[02:40:08.756 --> 02:40:10.197]  Can you hold it more that way for the camera, thanks.
[02:40:10.418 --> 02:40:10.878]  How's that?
[02:40:11.458 --> 02:40:12.039]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[02:40:12.099 --> 02:40:13.300]  A little bit lower, more that way.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:14.100]  There you go.
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:14.400]  Alright.
[02:40:14.701 --> 02:40:14.941]  Got it?
[02:40:15.501 --> 02:40:16.042]  We do, yes.
[02:40:16.062 --> 02:40:16.362]  Thank you.
[02:40:16.662 --> 02:40:20.885]  Okay, well this is a scene straight out of one of the Screenfold books from the post-classic.
[02:40:20.945 --> 02:40:22.206]  The books that are called Codices.
[02:40:22.856 --> 02:40:28.390]  And it shows an altar with a sacrificial victim bent over it, all tied, hands and feet tied.
[02:40:29.102 --> 02:40:33.344]  And his belly torn open because that's the way they actually got to the heart.
[02:40:33.364 --> 02:40:34.724]  They didn't go to the ribcage.
[02:40:35.024 --> 02:40:35.905]  They went underneath.
[02:40:36.345 --> 02:40:42.087]  And then out of the gaping hole in his chest grows a tree with a bird sitting on it.
[02:40:42.107 --> 02:40:46.408]  And that motif is actually found from the pre-classic all the way down through the post-classic.
[02:40:46.869 --> 02:40:51.310]  And it's a manifestation of this idea of giving something and getting something back.
[02:40:51.370 --> 02:40:53.291]  Talk about ink blots.
[02:40:53.511 --> 02:40:54.892]  To me that looks like a big green demon.
[02:40:54.932 --> 02:40:55.672]  Now I know it's a tree.
[02:40:56.152 --> 02:40:57.513]  Right, it's a tree, exactly.
[02:40:57.613 --> 02:41:03.856]  It's probably a ceiba tree, which is one of the most important and dominant trees in the forest there.
[02:41:04.316 --> 02:41:11.260]  And that bird, we call him the principal bird deity, he's found throughout Maya history that we are able to document.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:19.003]  And the murals, in fact, you made reference to the pre-classic murals that are somewhat copied in the film as they walk through the tunnels.
[02:41:19.684 --> 02:41:21.925]  There's a recent discovery of some just amazing
[02:41:22.597 --> 02:41:25.339]  Preclassic murals from northeastern Guatemala.
[02:41:25.379 --> 02:41:26.839]  The site is called San Bartolo.
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:31.142]  Anybody that's interested in the Maya should definitely check out San Bartolo.
[02:41:31.182 --> 02:41:33.543]  Just Google it and you'll find some of that stuff.
[02:41:33.623 --> 02:41:37.005]  Were the Aztecs in massive decline when Cortes arrived?
[02:41:37.705 --> 02:41:38.346]  No, they weren't.
[02:41:38.406 --> 02:41:41.107]  They were in the process of building their empire.
[02:41:41.147 --> 02:41:42.648]  They'd conquered their neighboring people.
[02:41:42.788 --> 02:41:44.429]  What about the whole civilization itself?
[02:41:44.929 --> 02:41:52.093]  Well, you know, I think that as far as I can tell, you know, you look at the scale on which they practiced human sacrifice,
[02:41:52.625 --> 02:42:04.557]  And you look at the concentrations of people, I can't say that they were in a state of environmental decline that's depicted in the Apocalypto, because they seem to have it pretty well together as far as I know.
[02:42:05.178 --> 02:42:12.085]  But they were also definitely conquering people all over Mexico and down into Central America.
[02:42:12.105 --> 02:42:15.929]  Before we run out of time, let's go through this in Ucatec.
[02:42:16.633 --> 02:42:21.435]  Okay, well, what I have here is the text of the speech of the high priest.
[02:42:21.475 --> 02:42:24.777]  This is the sacrificing priest up on the temple in Apocalypto.
[02:42:25.197 --> 02:42:27.719]  And it'll give you some idea of what the rationale is.
[02:42:28.139 --> 02:42:37.223]  Now, this isn't taken straight from a Maya document, but I know that there were Maya people and a Maya archaeologist involved in writing this piece of text.
[02:42:37.403 --> 02:42:44.547]  I was not involved in writing it, but I was involved in helping the actor pronounce it again when we did the overdubs.
[02:42:45.253 --> 02:42:49.776]  But just let me read part of it quickly to you in English and then I'll give you the Yucatec.
[02:42:50.136 --> 02:42:51.977]  These are the days of our great lament.
[02:42:52.578 --> 02:42:53.958]  The land thirsts.
[02:42:54.579 --> 02:42:57.341]  A great plague infests our crops.
[02:42:58.061 --> 02:43:01.723]  The scourge of sickness humiliates us at whim.
[02:43:02.384 --> 02:43:07.867]  They say this painful thing has made us weak, that we have become empty.
[02:43:08.408 --> 02:43:10.029]  They say that we rot.
[02:43:10.589 --> 02:43:13.831]  Great people of the banner of the sun, I say we are strong.
[02:43:14.281 --> 02:43:15.221]  We are chosen.
[02:43:15.661 --> 02:43:18.202]  Chosen to be the masters of time.
[02:43:18.942 --> 02:43:21.683]  And so, this is the beginning of this prayer.
[02:43:21.723 --> 02:43:23.184]  Let me just read it to you in Yucatec.
[02:43:23.224 --> 02:43:26.805]  Now, he's saying this to the people.
[02:43:26.825 --> 02:43:29.005]  There's a throng of thousands of people down below.
[02:43:29.425 --> 02:43:31.466]  But he's also saying it to the God.
[02:43:31.506 --> 02:43:36.427]  And the God who's named here in a little bit is Ukulkan, the Feathered Serpent.
[02:43:36.968 --> 02:43:39.748]  Bechlai Ukinilob, Yahiawatob.
[02:43:40.609 --> 02:43:41.709]  Ukahluma.
[02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:43.089]  They say we rot.
[02:43:43.109 --> 02:43:44.490]  That's what that means.
[02:44:09.659 --> 02:44:11.162]  We are the chosen ones.
[02:44:11.442 --> 02:44:13.806]  Chosen to be the masters of time.
[02:44:22.444 --> 02:44:28.650]  Now there's also some things in the film, and Mel's going to talk about this publicly, that are personal things that happened to him.
[02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:33.054]  Like one of the bad guys in the film is somebody he's attacking.
[02:44:33.114 --> 02:44:40.101]  He's calling him Almost, because the star, Jaguarpaw, almost beats him at the first of the film in a fight.
[02:44:40.121 --> 02:44:41.583]  So he tells him, you're almost.
[02:44:41.923 --> 02:44:45.646]  That's a very common device or expression of storytellers to put part of their story
[02:45:01.799 --> 02:45:06.382]  Unless they're doing a documentary and trying to make it as objectively scientific as possible.
[02:45:06.442 --> 02:45:07.342]  Yeah, sure, the nitpickers.
[02:45:07.382 --> 02:45:12.225]  I mean, he just took a lot of real stuff, combined it in, and even put some of his own, you know, life experiences in.
[02:45:12.425 --> 02:45:13.205]  What's this next one?
[02:45:13.225 --> 02:45:15.646]  I mean, this is a good scene in the movie about not having fear.
[02:45:15.686 --> 02:45:16.067]  I like it.
[02:45:16.867 --> 02:45:18.248]  Have we got time to... Yeah, we got time.
[02:45:18.288 --> 02:45:18.528]  Let's do it.
[02:45:18.548 --> 02:45:20.969]  Okay, this is... I did this on Sunday.
[02:45:20.989 --> 02:45:24.271]  I'm happy to do it again because it's really my favorite piece of the script.
[02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:35.979]  But this is the scene early on when Jaguar Paw and his friends and his father encounter a group of people passing through that part of the forest.
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:38.221]  And they're obviously on the run.
[02:45:38.281 --> 02:45:39.382]  They look terrified.
[02:45:39.942 --> 02:45:41.023]  Men, women and children.
[02:45:41.423 --> 02:45:43.205]  They've obviously been through some kind of
[02:45:43.772 --> 02:45:55.007]  Battle and they're trying to ask permission to pass through that part of the forest and then as they as they depart, they've traded to meet with some for some fish.
[02:45:56.087 --> 02:46:00.628]  As they depart, they say, our lands were ravaged, and then they pass on through the forest.
[02:46:00.648 --> 02:46:05.690]  Actually, they say, our lands were ravaged, and then Jaguar Paw comes back with, your lands were ravaged?
[02:46:06.090 --> 02:46:08.871]  And they say, yes, we're going to go and, you know, seek a new beginning.
[02:46:09.531 --> 02:46:18.134]  And at that point, Jaguar Paw's father calls him back, because he does not want him to go ahead and engage these people in this conversation.
[02:46:18.234 --> 02:46:22.275]  And hear about all the scary stuff, and then bring it back to the village.
[02:46:22.335 --> 02:46:25.136]  So now he gives him this lecture about fear.
[02:46:25.891 --> 02:46:30.373]  So, he says, and I'll give it to you, I'll give the English inter-linearly here.
[02:46:30.813 --> 02:46:33.434]  Teche, cap el chaha na tukul.
[02:46:34.074 --> 02:46:35.074]  You are trouble again.
[02:46:35.574 --> 02:46:37.075]  Le makob te kasho.
[02:46:37.515 --> 02:46:38.655]  Vash tawila tiob.
[02:46:39.136 --> 02:46:41.436]  Those people in the forest, what did you see on them?
[02:46:42.477 --> 02:46:43.157]  Sakhki.
[02:46:44.057 --> 02:46:44.477]  Fear.
[02:46:45.278 --> 02:46:47.138]  Tam kak a sakhki.
[02:46:47.558 --> 02:46:49.099]  Deep, rotting fear.
[02:46:49.519 --> 02:46:51.460]  Le tiob utsaya tiob le lo.
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:52.160]  Tawila?
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:53.901]  They were infected by it.
[02:46:54.121 --> 02:46:54.561]  Did you see?
[02:46:58.157 --> 02:46:59.577]  Fear is a sickness.
[02:47:02.998 --> 02:47:04.479]  It will crawl into the soul.
[02:47:04.499 --> 02:47:06.559]  It has tainted your peace already.
[02:47:06.579 --> 02:47:08.260]  I did not raise you to see you with fear.
[02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:09.460]  Strike it from your heart.
[02:47:24.841 --> 02:47:26.222]  Do not bring it into the village.
[02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:30.526]  At first light, we will gather with the elders at the sacred hill of our fathers.
[02:47:30.927 --> 02:47:33.589]  There we will call on our spirits to guide us.
[02:47:47.307 --> 02:47:52.452]  Well, I mean, it's important to study human history, because if you don't know it, the old cliche goes, you'll be doomed to repeat it.
[02:47:52.952 --> 02:47:57.436]  And this is a major artery, not a thread, running through human history.
[02:47:57.857 --> 02:48:01.660]  And people need to face up to what societies and establishments, i.e.
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:02.741]  governments, have done.
[02:48:03.081 --> 02:48:04.423]  They always become abusive.
[02:48:04.463 --> 02:48:06.204]  They always become insane.
[02:48:06.524 --> 02:48:08.887]  They always become completely dominating.
[02:48:09.327 --> 02:48:12.890]  And our own elite today is doing horrible, evil things right out in the open.
[02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.671]  But just like
[02:48:14.091 --> 02:48:20.757]  Aztecs or Mayans during this whole period, the general public just accepts it because we've been raised up in it.
[02:48:21.117 --> 02:48:23.159]  And that's why I think history itself is important.
[02:48:23.179 --> 02:48:35.369]  And I think Mel Gibson has really given us a window into a lot of things that were happening just south of us that most people on this planet, most even Mexicans in Mexico aren't aware of.
[02:48:35.649 --> 02:48:40.974]  We'll come back and quickly talk to Demetrius and Bill with their quick questions on the other side in the final segment.
[02:48:48.277 --> 02:48:48.737]  It's here!
[02:48:48.958 --> 02:48:53.741]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.101 --> 02:49:01.767]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.447 --> 02:49:09.512]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.892 --> 02:49:16.777]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.273 --> 02:49:21.316]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.617 --> 02:49:25.240]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:27.481]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.842 --> 02:49:31.765]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:45.801]  Terrorism!
[02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:46.701]  Terrorism!
[02:49:46.801 --> 02:49:52.866]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:49:53.126 --> 02:49:54.727]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:49:54.967 --> 02:49:57.429]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:49:57.829 --> 02:50:12.399]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:12.439 --> 02:50:12.760]  government.
[02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:14.721]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:50:15.101 --> 02:50:21.003]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:21.163 --> 02:50:25.624]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:51:50.053 --> 02:51:51.194]  Trust your government.
[02:51:51.214 --> 02:51:51.595]  It's good.
[02:51:51.635 --> 02:51:52.175]  It's loving.
[02:51:52.195 --> 02:51:53.837]  The government wouldn't hurt you.
[02:51:54.577 --> 02:51:55.098]  What do you mean?
[02:51:55.118 --> 02:52:01.463]  I mean, it's just always government and elites murdering and killing and sacrificing and warring and enslaving.
[02:52:01.483 --> 02:52:05.967]  And we're so naive to not think that, you know, it's somehow changed today.
[02:52:06.608 --> 02:52:09.870]  Demetrius of South Carolina, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:52:10.251 --> 02:52:11.512]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:52:12.232 --> 02:52:12.513]  Thanks.
[02:52:12.533 --> 02:52:13.534]  I appreciate everything.
[02:52:13.554 --> 02:52:14.635]  Alex, I love your show.
[02:52:14.655 --> 02:52:17.317]  I just started listening like three weeks ago.
[02:52:18.067 --> 02:52:26.412]  And everything you say is scary, but I'm glad to hear it, because I do believe that our government, you know, doesn't always look out for our best interests.
[02:52:27.032 --> 02:52:32.756]  And I kind of had this in the back of my head, but everything you hear makes more sense, especially the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:52:33.156 --> 02:52:36.718]  And a lot of people in my community and that I know are real ignorant about it.
[02:52:37.238 --> 02:52:45.423]  But regarding anthropology in general, there was a book I read by the author Eric Fromm, and he analyzes, like,
[02:52:45.970 --> 02:52:49.293]  The psychological side of politics and just human nature in general.
[02:52:49.953 --> 02:53:12.190]  And I would like to ask the doctor, what does she make of, like, different cultures that had killed an animal like a bear, or had did sacrifices, but at the same time, after they had performed the sacrifice, they actually did a ritual to, like, kind of honor the animal that they killed, as if they were... Yeah, Dr. McCloud, I mean, specifically, what is the question?
[02:53:14.545 --> 02:53:30.680]  I mean, I know that human nature, you know, she said that there's a bloodlust, you know, but is there something, you know, from studies of ancient cultures that shows that there's also like a side of human nature that really doesn't want to kill?
[02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.261]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:53:32.281 --> 02:53:34.203]  Well, obviously there's a side of human nature that doesn't want to.
[02:53:34.223 --> 02:53:35.064]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:35.424 --> 02:53:36.946]  Hey, thanks, Demetrius.
[02:53:37.266 --> 02:53:38.988]  Yeah, I see where you're going with that.
[02:53:39.864 --> 02:53:44.966]  My experience with that is mostly from Native American peoples of both North America and Central America.
[02:53:45.006 --> 02:53:56.270]  There is this idea that if we have to hunt, and we do because we are meat eaters, you know, we are biologically programmed to be omnivores.
[02:53:56.910 --> 02:54:02.432]  And so we do kill, we do take life, and a lot of the Native American people have a ritual.
[02:54:02.472 --> 02:54:03.813]  In fact, the ritual takes place
[02:54:04.443 --> 02:54:05.983]  Not only after, but before.
[02:54:06.023 --> 02:54:08.224]  The ritual begins as the hunt begins.
[02:54:08.264 --> 02:54:09.484]  They do a ritual for the hunt.
[02:54:09.524 --> 02:54:10.484]  And then they thank the deer.
[02:54:10.544 --> 02:54:15.965]  And they ask permission to take an animal's life, or even to take a tree down.
[02:54:16.025 --> 02:54:16.225]  Sure.
[02:54:16.425 --> 02:54:17.166]  We've got to move quick.
[02:54:17.206 --> 02:54:18.086]  Bill in Ohio.
[02:54:18.346 --> 02:54:19.506]  You're on the air last caller.
[02:54:19.546 --> 02:54:20.346]  Go ahead Bill, quickly.
[02:54:20.546 --> 02:54:21.406]  Bill in Chicago.
[02:54:22.287 --> 02:54:31.128]  What about the arrow correction with about three days at the end of the Mayan calendar, and I think it's ironic that it ends a month before, after Hillary's
[02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:36.492]  Before Hillary's term will be up.
[02:54:37.812 --> 02:54:41.375]  Well, I think it's really interesting that it's tied in with the winter solstice, too.
[02:54:41.435 --> 02:54:43.876]  I mean, I think that's the most interesting part of it.
[02:54:43.936 --> 02:54:50.901]  There's actually a two day correction to the calendar, and it has to do with the way in which the correlation was developed.
[02:54:51.608 --> 02:55:02.853]  And it was corrected when people... But let's be clear, you don't believe things end on 2012, and the actual Mayan documents that you've read from the stone shows that they just mean a new cycle begins.
[02:55:03.133 --> 02:55:09.096]  Well, I'm one of the people that's involved in deciphering the phrase from the last time it happened, back in 3113 B.C.
[02:55:09.536 --> 02:55:16.979]  So I know what they say there, and they say, we'll change, or we'll be changed
[02:55:17.506 --> 02:55:20.027]  The hearth at the mouth of the sky.
[02:55:20.528 --> 02:55:23.909]  And I know from other studies of my iconography... That means culture.
[02:55:24.049 --> 02:55:32.313]  They conceive of the sky as a house, as a deified house, and the hearth is the heart of culture.
[02:55:33.334 --> 02:55:43.799]  Yeah, so people running around saying, even if you believe what the Mayans are saying, and again, we don't, it's their religion, it doesn't end in 2012.
[02:55:43.859 --> 02:55:44.379]  No, it doesn't.
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:46.541]  Something changes in 2012, but things don't end.
[02:55:47.964 --> 02:55:49.004]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:55:49.685 --> 02:55:51.565]  Dr. McLeod, I want to thank you for coming in.
[02:55:51.605 --> 02:55:53.566]  Any websites, any things we should check?
[02:55:54.386 --> 02:56:01.048]  Well, MezoWeb, M-E-S-O-W-E-B, is a great source for scholars and laypeople alike.
[02:56:01.508 --> 02:56:02.629]  Just Google it.
[02:56:02.709 --> 02:56:04.509]  You also teach flying lessons here in town.
[02:56:04.569 --> 02:56:04.969]  That's right.
[02:56:04.989 --> 02:56:07.510]  You're going to take us up to videotape the Trans-Texas Corridor soon.
[02:56:07.530 --> 02:56:08.130]  Tell us where you're at.
[02:56:08.651 --> 02:56:09.471]  I'm based at
[02:56:10.786 --> 02:56:15.810]  At Bergstrom, the south end of Bergstrom, Atlantic Flight Support, and I'm with the University Flying Club.
[02:56:16.330 --> 02:56:18.052]  All right, so fantastic.
[02:56:18.232 --> 02:56:19.333]  Well, listen, thank you for coming in.
[02:56:19.773 --> 02:56:20.274]  You're welcome.
[02:56:20.354 --> 02:56:20.834]  That was great.
[02:56:21.254 --> 02:56:23.076]  All right, folks, see you back tonight, see you back tomorrow.
[02:56:23.096 --> 02:56:23.536]  God bless.
