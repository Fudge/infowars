[00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:06.241]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:07.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:09.823]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.263]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:12.924]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:17.226]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.848]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:39.686]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:42.908]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:51.814]  It is the fifth day of January 2006, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:59.640]  Larry Silverstein has now gone public, at least through the government he has,
[00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:22.647]  With a ridiculously simple and flimsy excuse for his statements on PBS television about giving the order to have the building pulled, which is the demolition definition or terminology for imploding or a controlled demolition.
[00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.733]  The controlled destruction of a building.
[00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:31.193]  So, coming up in this hour, I am going to play the clip of Silverstein.
[00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:32.674]  The infamous clip.
[00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:34.454]  We're going to also play from the same documentary.
[00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:41.496]  Clips where it shows them demolishing other buildings later that had not completely imploded.
[00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:46.617]  And as they blow them up, they say, getting ready to pull building 6.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.505]  That's what the individual, the head demolition foreman actually says on the video.
[00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:59.206]  So, in the documentary it's all about destroying buildings.
[00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:04.390]  And all about how Tower 1 and 2 and 7 fell that day and then how they demolished the other buildings.
[00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.634]  So, here's Silverstein saying, we pulled the building and then it cuts next to somebody going, getting ready to pull number 6.
[00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:17.218]  And then millions of dollars of ads were running New York saying, answer the question Silverstein.
[00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:18.699]  He wouldn't and I probably called his office.
[00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.209]  Twenty times.
[00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.571]  And of course, Building 7, clearly from all the video, was blown up.
[00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:25.932]  You see the ejection ports.
[00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:27.612]  You see the blast points.
[00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:30.313]  You see the squibs, as they're called.
[00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:33.995]  The little ejections of gas and dust.
[00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:41.778]  As right on the girder support points, where they hook into the superstructure.
[00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:44.158]  I mean, it was like clockwork.
[00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:47.860]  It was like watching a hotel get blown up in Las Vegas.
[00:02:49.557 --> 00:02:51.459]  So, just amazing.
[00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.521]  We're going to go back over this, but I'll tell you what he has to say.
[00:02:55.662 --> 00:03:06.251]  And he has done this through one of the surrogate groups in the executive branch of the federal government that has been actively demonizing myself and many others in the past.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:16.866]  Silverstein answers WTC7 building charges, says Pullet meant to evacuate firefighters, but there were no firefighters in the building.
[00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:21.929]  FEMA's own report says that, even Popular Mechanics' own hit piece against it says that.
[00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:32.596]  The New York Fire Department says that, that they had been out since Giuliani was told to evacuate in the morning because, quote, the towers are going to come down.
[00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:48.244]  Oh, by the way, I told you, Scott, to pull the three clips of Silverstein saying, blow it, pull it, and then the same documentary describing pull it as meaning demolition, and then Dan Rather saying it looks like dynamite to bring the building down.
[00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:59.931]  See if that, in that whole plethora of clips you've got, see if you can find, it's been a while, probably six months since we've played this, there's also Giuliani.
[00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:12.815]  And if you go to our WTC7 section on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, in our whole analysis page, there's probably about 75 links on there to audio and video and firefighters saying bombs were in there.
[00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:18.150]  See if you can find that clip where it's Giuliani talking about getting the warning to leave the building.
[00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.032]  Oh yeah, and find the edited clip we've got.
[00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:22.672]  We have to edit it.
[00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:24.614]  It's got a lot of profanity on it.
[00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:29.837]  You can go to the website and watch the unedited profanity-laced one if you'd like, but we have to follow some rules here.
[00:04:29.857 --> 00:04:31.238]  Or at least we try to.
[00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:36.321]  Only the F-words and S-words have been cut out to protect the innocent.
[00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:40.123]  Find the one with the firefighters going, It was like they had detonators!
[00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:41.804]  Boom, boom, boom!
[00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:44.914]  So, we'll get into this.
[00:04:45.114 --> 00:04:46.334]  There's a bunch of other big news.
[00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:50.576]  Obviously, Ariel Sharon hanging on by his fingernails to life.
[00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:57.899]  And so much more when we get back on the other side of this quick break.
[00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:05.477]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.737 --> 00:05:07.319]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.324]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.664 --> 00:05:19.411]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.731 --> 00:05:21.712]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.912 --> 00:05:24.753]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:29.514]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:34.096]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:41.578]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.259]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.140]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.515]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:07.797]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:10.799]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:17.562]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.762 --> 00:06:20.766]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:23.370]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:33.504]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chlorofluoride.
[00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:34.604]  M-T-B-E.
[00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:35.264]  Radon 222.
[00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:37.705]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:42.966]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:50.867]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:08.736]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:21.809]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.791]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:27.414]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:31.477]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:36.701]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:07:38.943 --> 00:07:42.906]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:06.845]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:08.586]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:10.408]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.028 --> 00:08:11.849]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.111]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:18.114]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:22.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:31.085]  I'm sure a lot of you have heard the fake conservative neocon talk shows out there.
[00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:49.334]  Talking about how yesterday in France, hundreds of French commuters on a train had a large gang of North African hoodlums robbing them and attempting to rape them.
[00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:58.979]  And this was all caught on tape, of course, and the big police state, France, can't keep their citizens safe, and they've predominantly confiscated their guns.
[00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:11.766]  I mean, imagine in a free society with a concealed carry here in Texas, if you went on a train trying to rape people, I mean, guaranteed, you'd get your head blown off real fast if there wasn't already police on board that train.
[00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:16.028]  But, now the neocons
[00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:22.051]  Can get up on the radio and say, see, all Muslims want to kill us.
[00:09:22.652 --> 00:09:23.973]  They want to attack us.
[00:09:24.893 --> 00:09:26.195]  They're out to get us.
[00:09:26.235 --> 00:09:28.757]  This is absolute proof of a total jihad.
[00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:30.238]  They're all evil.
[00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.439]  They all want to take over.
[00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:32.740]  They all want to destroy America.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.701]  Well, okay, let's just say that's true.
[00:09:35.122 --> 00:09:37.364]  It's not true, but let's just say it's true.
[00:09:38.084 --> 00:09:55.469]  I don't want to hear about how we've got to stay behind the war in Iraq, and how we've got to beat them over there instead of over here, and how they're this ultimate threat when Bush is bringing in record levels of Middle Eastern and Central Asian immigrants to this country, both low-tech and high-tech.
[00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.670]  Record levels!
[00:10:01.811 --> 00:10:06.793]  Now, quite frankly,
[00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:23.179]  To get down to brass tacks on this situation, there are some Muslim groups that really do want to jihad, that really do want to quote take over the world and proselytize.
[00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:30.277]  But at the same time, even most, quote, Muslim nations allow and leave Christians and Jews alone.
[00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:34.439]  Take Iran, a huge Jewish population, a huge Christian population.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.183]  They've even got Zoroastrians, you know, an ancient dog-worshipping and star-worshipping cult.
[00:10:41.444 --> 00:10:42.824]  I'm not kidding, that's what they worship.
[00:10:44.846 --> 00:10:46.867]  And, I guess there's worse things to worship.
[00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:50.029]  I'm being sarcastic, I like dogs, but I sure wouldn't worship them.
[00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:51.930]  I digressed.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.905]  The point is, is that by going into Iraq, that certainly does lend credence and stir up the radical elements of Islam.
[00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:10.052]  And at the same time, our own government, and I had a former CIA commander on yesterday who led CIA operations in Afghanistan, folks.
[00:11:12.494 --> 00:11:13.415]  What, Mr. Brinson?
[00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:18.024]  And he admitted that our government helped radicalize Islam in the fifties and sixties.
[00:11:18.064 --> 00:11:28.131]  He admitted our government carried out terrorist attacks to blame it on leaders of Islamic countries that were not Islamicist, who were really pro-Western.
[00:11:28.552 --> 00:11:32.755]  Now, I talked about Mosaddegh and how our government carried out terror bombings to blame it on him.
[00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:39.440]  And the CIA commander, that's what MSNBC calls him, said, yes, it's true.
[00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:41.821]  So,
[00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:54.546]  This threat, whether it's real, or manufactured, or partially manufactured, and still there's some real threat there, it's only being exacerbated.
[00:11:54.566 --> 00:12:05.109]  You see, the very people that get on the air, I heard Neil Borch driving in this morning, the very people that get on the air and say, all the muzzles want to kill us, it's a jihad, we gotta get them.
[00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.770]  I mean, he was actually saying that.
[00:12:08.871 --> 00:12:12.832]  But he'll never go further and say, oh, by the way, Bush is a piece of filth,
[00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:18.906]  For having our borders totally wide open and bringing in record levels of immigrants from every corner of the planet.
[00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:36.017]  Or that Bush has openly, that's openly, ordered our own intelligence agencies and the CIA and FBI, I mean there's hundreds of articles about this, scores of instances of it,
[00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:45.680]  It's been covered from every angle to, quote, leave the Al-Qaeda network alone, to, oh, you're the dean of the Defense Language School.
[00:12:46.941 --> 00:12:51.023]  You don't like it that you're training people that you think are terrorists.
[00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:56.045]  Well, they're government operatives, and you're going to give them the top-secret training, Mohammed Adda and others.
[00:12:56.065 --> 00:13:05.870]  I mean, that's the Defense Language School dean, Monterey, California, teaching classes, complaining before, quietly, and then after, and saying in the newspaper, and the
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.764]  San Jose Mercury News that quote, our government was behind 9-11 and remember you never heard from him again.
[00:13:16.944 --> 00:13:22.288]  And the same terrorists, who were really government agents, were trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[00:13:22.328 --> 00:13:29.872]  They were trained in many other different forms of espionage when they were trying to come back into the U.S.
[00:13:30.513 --> 00:13:31.133]  and the U.S.
[00:13:31.193 --> 00:13:37.837]  embassies were trying to block them from their Malaysian and other summits in Saudi Arabia
[00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:43.970]  The heads of the embassies, we've interviewed several of them, were told leave them alone.
[00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.591]  These are government operatives.
[00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.774]  It's their cover that they're terrorists.
[00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:58.281]  So we have it in concrete that even the supposed hijackers were clearly trained U.S.
[00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:04.286]  spies of criminal elements that are in control of our government.
[00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:07.689]  And so when you hear about Muslim gangs
[00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:24.376]  On a train, after a month-long orgy of burning and beating people up, and it was racial, it was sectarian, that's how humans operate.
[00:14:25.437 --> 00:14:26.598]  I mean, that's what happens.
[00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:32.143]  That's why throughout history, on average, a bunch of different groups of people
[00:14:33.144 --> 00:14:34.505]  Don't get along with each other.
[00:14:34.565 --> 00:14:39.810]  I mean, there are even revolutions in Mexico between the different states.
[00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.232]  They don't even get along down there.
[00:14:41.272 --> 00:14:46.416]  I mean, look at four different groups of white people killing each other in the Balkans.
[00:14:47.117 --> 00:14:48.238]  This is the way it is.
[00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:50.180]  It's the way it's always been.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.425]  Empires try to use sports and other events as false unifiers.
[00:14:56.323 --> 00:15:05.108]  To get cities to unify, no matter what color the people are in the city, you know, behind the horns or behind the Trojans.
[00:15:05.868 --> 00:15:13.692]  And Caesar wrote about it, the Romans openly talked about it, that the Greek philosophers discussed it.
[00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:18.915]  It was part of the mechanism of government when you had a big unwieldy empire.
[00:15:19.947 --> 00:15:22.449]  To use sports as a false unifier.
[00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:28.534]  It's not even that I'm against the Rose Bowl or UT's fabulous win yesterday.
[00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:35.119]  In and of itself, it's just that I know it is a psychological tool of control.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:46.427]  And last night, well, before I get into the Rose Bowl, let me just go back and what happened in downtown Austin last night that I was a witness to, unfortunately.
[00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:48.089]  I'm just total bedlam.
[00:15:50.527 --> 00:15:53.950]  Back to the Michael Savages and the Boardsters of the World.
[00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:00.495]  They'll tell you all about the Muslims, and then tell you the solution is going over there and attacking their countries and killing them and going after them.
[00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:16.908]  Well, there's several problems with that on the surface, but then they leave out of the equation, half of the equation or more, that our own government has helped radicalize the Muslims, helped put them into power, the more radical elements, and helped stir them up, and is bringing them in at record levels.
[00:16:18.048 --> 00:16:19.508]  So, on its face, it's a fraud.
[00:16:19.868 --> 00:16:21.029]  And then we look at Iraq.
[00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:34.671]  We look at Iraq with Saddam Hussein, who was a secular leader, where had more freedom for Christians and Jews and other groups than any other country in the Middle East or Central Asia.
[00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:40.372]  Just absolute freedom compared to other countries.
[00:16:40.472 --> 00:16:46.873]  Sixty percent, back in 1990 numbers, of the people graduating were women, including doctors.
[00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.590]  And now look at it.
[00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.671]  And that was the Israeli plan in 1983.
[00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:54.091]  It's been in the Haratz and Jerusalem Post.
[00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:56.171]  We've written articles about it.
[00:16:57.212 --> 00:16:58.052]  We've covered it here.
[00:16:58.412 --> 00:17:08.574]  Israel said the plan is to have the Americans go in, break it up in three or four different parts, and have different Islamist sects over different sectors.
[00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:15.275]  Have the Kurds, have the Shiites, maybe have two different groups of Shiites, have the Sunnis,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:23.943]  And then have a weak central government, and just control the pipelines in the region, and then use it as a military base to invade Iran and Syria.
[00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:32.926]  And then you read the PNAC documents of 2000, the particular Rebuilding America's Defenses, September 19th document, September 20th, excuse me.
[00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:35.307]  Didn't get enough sleep last night.
[00:17:35.907 --> 00:17:39.489]  And when you read it, it says the exact same thing.
[00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:41.089]  When you read Brzezinski, the same thing.
[00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:43.270]  Because it's all going off the same playbook.
[00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.133]  And then you realize that, I mean, they're putting the burkas on the women right now in Iraq.
[00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:51.455]  I mean, they're stoning the women again.
[00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:53.977]  Because she talked to a guy on the street.
[00:17:54.637 --> 00:17:56.319]  They are killing the women.
[00:17:56.699 --> 00:18:01.983]  They are, they are, the most radical elements are taking over and our government just thinks it's absolutely wonderful.
[00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:07.047]  Folks, it was all designed, and, oh, you don't believe me?
[00:18:07.067 --> 00:18:14.052]  Just type P2, that's just the letter P, and then the number 2, not T-W-O, just
[00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:24.316]  P, the number 2, O, G. P-2-O-G.
[00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:29.977]  And you'll get EPI, AP, Pentagon documents, you'll get it all.
[00:18:31.257 --> 00:18:40.380]  Where they say Rumsfeld has six billion bucks a year funded to actually create terrorists and to stir them up and to kill innocent Muslims to get them to attack us.
[00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:46.616]  That's their one big desire other than confiscating our guns or domestically and bankrupting us and taking our pension funds.
[00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:47.778]  That's the big plan.
[00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:49.820]  And you'll soon get to enjoy that.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.482]  Don't worry, it'll be right in front of your eyeballs.
[00:18:51.522 --> 00:18:52.344]  You can deny it all day.
[00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:53.225]  You can run, but you can't hide.
[00:18:53.605 --> 00:18:57.190]  You will be raped by the New World Order and then you will wake up and you will fight them and we will beat them.
[00:18:58.071 --> 00:18:58.271]  You see?
[00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:04.183]  You can deny reality all day and stick your head in the Rose Bowl, it isn't going away.
[00:19:04.463 --> 00:19:07.044]  And really, that's why I got upset last night.
[00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:10.665]  I got off the TV about 9, did some work at the studio until about 10.
[00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:21.069]  A friend of mine is moving to Los Angeles, plus we had some business to discuss, so I was up in his high-rise apartment with he and his girlfriend, helping him move some heavier stuff that she couldn't help him move.
[00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:29.012]  And I'm up there, and he's a Hollywood producer, he's a producer at Penthouse.
[00:19:29.742 --> 00:19:32.184]  And I'm up there moving the stuff around with him.
[00:19:32.624 --> 00:19:35.106]  He's just getting ready for the movers that are coming in a couple days.
[00:19:36.086 --> 00:19:36.947]  Why does that even matter?
[00:19:36.987 --> 00:19:38.748]  Why do I always tell stories and so much to tell?
[00:19:39.689 --> 00:19:42.391]  And I'm up there and it's midnight and UT wins.
[00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.453]  And we went up on the roof and watched it.
[00:19:45.613 --> 00:19:51.317]  And it was very interesting and I will describe to you what the people were doing.
[00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:53.678]  And why it was so upsetting to me.
[00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:55.620]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.080]  Stay with us.

[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.080]  The real money, folks.
[00:21:10.382 --> 00:21:12.303]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:12.803 --> 00:21:13.684]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:13.724 --> 00:21:14.324]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:14.364 --> 00:21:14.684]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:21.638 --> 00:21:27.563]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[00:21:27.663 --> 00:21:30.886]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:31.647 --> 00:21:33.989]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:21:34.009 --> 00:21:37.271]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:37.892 --> 00:21:40.914]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:22:20.888 --> 00:22:21.408]  I don't know.

[00:23:07.728 --> 00:23:10.370]  Today we're talking about guilt-free, healthy coffee.
[00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:13.273]  Yes, it is possible to enjoy healthy coffee.
[00:23:13.553 --> 00:23:16.096]  And on today's episode, we're going to tell you how.
[00:23:16.316 --> 00:23:17.357]  More after this break.
[00:23:18.268 --> 00:23:22.029]  It's time to wake up and start your day on a healthy note with Gano Coffee.
[00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:32.993]  What makes Gano Coffee so special is the addition of high-quality Ganoderma from the amazingly nutritious red reishi mushroom that provides energy and helps expel toxins from the body.

[00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:40.476]  Welcome back to Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:44.018]  I'm Joe Java with news that you can enjoy guilt-free coffee.
[00:23:44.118 --> 00:23:51.342]  Just visit our website, coffeeontheair.com or call us directly at 866-271-3653.

[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.062]  Alright, what's coming up is I'm going to play this David Letterman piece where he attacks Bill O'Reilly.
[00:24:16.322 --> 00:24:19.703]  And, frankly, this is a total shell operation.
[00:24:19.723 --> 00:24:35.469]  I mean, David Letterman, who I happen to like, by the way, I think he's very talented, very funny guy, still is not in the position as the most powerful comedian in America with the biggest audience for one of those nightly shows, late shows, out there because he's stupid.
[00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:45.267]  And so he attacks O'Reilly but creates a false paradigm and really shifts people into a controlled box.
[00:24:46.228 --> 00:24:51.171]  And so he may be doing it on purpose, I tend to think he is, or at the same time he may just be regurgitating.
[00:24:53.003 --> 00:24:58.108]  The false political map that he's been given through the mainstream news.
[00:24:58.168 --> 00:25:03.072]  But it's also somewhat entertaining and O'Reilly was squirming in his chair.
[00:25:03.112 --> 00:25:04.112]  He's such a bully.
[00:25:04.152 --> 00:25:10.638]  I mean, I've seen him scream at people on Fox television, on clips I see on the web, where somebody argues with him.
[00:25:10.658 --> 00:25:12.379]  Well, Donahue, you just shut up!
[00:25:12.499 --> 00:25:14.441]  Shut up or I'll kick you out of here right now!
[00:25:15.709 --> 00:25:19.551]  I mean, if he can't debate you, he'll talk over you and just shut your microphone off.
[00:25:19.591 --> 00:25:25.273]  I mean, you think I'm bad sometimes when I'm debating somebody, where they get like 40% of the time and I get 60.
[00:25:25.853 --> 00:25:26.313]  Oh, no, no.
[00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:27.234]  You might get 5%.
[00:25:27.674 --> 00:25:43.721]  You know, the time that Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, that was suing the government for involvement in 9-11, back before it was popular and cool, three years ago, you can see a clip of that in Masters of Terror, one of my better films,
[00:25:45.652 --> 00:25:49.473]  He's on Hannity and Combs, and Hannity would not let him talk.
[00:25:50.014 --> 00:25:52.314]  I mean, he just... Hannity talked the entire time.
[00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:56.176]  He literally couldn't get three words out edgewise, and he put a clip of that in the film.
[00:25:56.736 --> 00:25:59.157]  But, um... I'm already digressing.
[00:25:59.477 --> 00:26:08.280]  We'll cover all that and get into the latest major Larry Silverstein developments concerning the controlled demolition of Building 7 and Tower 1 and 2.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.422]  He's now, finally, three years into our expose of him trying to spin it.
[00:26:13.462 --> 00:26:14.442]  He's gone into overdrive.
[00:26:15.405 --> 00:26:17.607]  Working with the State Department of all groups.
[00:26:17.647 --> 00:26:23.872]  But before we do that, last night I was helping a friend move, and he lives downtown.
[00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:30.117]  And quite frankly, the game was on in the background.
[00:26:30.137 --> 00:26:39.224]  And just because there's such mindless worship of UT, and because it's such a distraction, I was jokingly rooting for USC.
[00:26:40.376 --> 00:26:47.321]  But when we had it on the background, and we were talking shop, talking about the New World Order, talking about mind control, and then the game ended.
[00:26:48.082 --> 00:26:53.386]  And within about two minutes, you started hearing beep, beep, beep, beep, and started hearing a roar.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.642]  And his place is down on 8th Street.
[00:26:57.822 --> 00:26:59.083]  6th Street is right by it.
[00:26:59.123 --> 00:27:04.147]  There was screaming, yelling, honking going on there all around the building.
[00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:05.588]  And he had big windows.
[00:27:05.628 --> 00:27:08.510]  We had them open looking down onto the crowd.
[00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.813]  Started mashing on every major downtown street.
[00:27:13.374 --> 00:27:22.741]  And then we saw the UT Tower up north from him, just about a mile, half mile or so, turn orange.
[00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:24.402]  And I call it the Tower of Death.
[00:27:25.163 --> 00:27:34.512]  It's a Masonic-style tower, but also it's where, back in the early 60s, the famous Marine Corps sniper went up there and shot a whole bunch of people.
[00:27:34.972 --> 00:27:49.626]  So I call it the Tower of Death, Cirith Ungul, and so it turned red, as they do whenever there's a championship won, and then you can hear the screaming from a mile away, much louder than the screaming right down below,
[00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:56.343]  And then for about another 30 minutes, I left and drove home.
[00:27:56.363 --> 00:28:18.139]  You know, I was down at Hellbent and Peck, and I'm driving home, having to navigate the screaming, the yelling, the hook-em-horns, and they were running through the streets as I was walking to the parking meter of my car, and they were doing hook-em-horns, hook-em-horns, and I wouldn't hook-em-horns back, and they looked crazed and didn't know why, just running past me mindlessly.
[00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:19.800]  And then I thought about,
[00:28:20.894 --> 00:28:39.398]  When Andrew Jackson beat the British, beat Lord Wellington's force that had never been defeated, not by Napoleon, not by the Indians of India, not by any force, Lord Wellington had beaten numbers 3, 4, 5, in some cases, in one battle in India about 10 times his number.
[00:28:39.778 --> 00:28:42.439]  I said on TV last night, like 6 times, actually 10 times I looked it up.
[00:28:43.206 --> 00:28:47.069]  And you know, modern army with German commanders with bigger cannons than he had.
[00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:52.433]  Well, they came to meet Andrew Jackson, old hickory, Brigadier General Jackson.
[00:28:53.193 --> 00:28:55.695]  The country song calls him Colonel Jackson, but that was his nickname.
[00:28:56.272 --> 00:28:57.432]  He was a Brigadier General by then.
[00:28:57.892 --> 00:29:07.614]  And the people did come out and yell and scream and beat drums and celebrate all over the country when we won a major victory against those that want to enslave us.
[00:29:07.954 --> 00:29:24.097]  But no, you'll never hear that, you'll never see that, you'll never see... I mean, listen, if we threw the Federal Reserve out, if the people knew what was good for them and what to celebrate, there should be ten days of celebration and rolling around screaming in delight on the ground.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.682]  Because that would be real, that would be a real victory.
[00:29:27.702 --> 00:29:34.488]  But we have this surrogate warfare, this surrogate tribalism that just isn't real.
[00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:37.050]  It's just hot air.
[00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:44.437]  And I just see people so just, I can die happy now, my horns won.
[00:29:45.778 --> 00:29:50.562]  Meanwhile, the government's kidnapping children and putting them in slave camps and it's public and nobody wants to help them.
[00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:55.129]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.650]  It's the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.591]  Often imitated, never duplicated by carpetbaggers.
[00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:32.156]  Down here in Central Texas.
[00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:33.757]  But this is the real deal.
[00:33:33.797 --> 00:33:34.697]  The real McCoy.
[00:33:34.757 --> 00:33:35.737]  Telling it like it is.
[00:33:35.797 --> 00:33:36.637]  Getting the word out.
[00:33:37.837 --> 00:33:38.838]  I am so excited.
[00:33:39.738 --> 00:33:42.798]  In fact, next week they've got to give me a list of all the new affiliates.
[00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:44.419]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:46.419]  Just all over the place.
[00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:48.439]  Southern California.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.120]  Southern Arizona.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.001]  Southern Texas.
[00:33:54.281 --> 00:33:55.161]  Corpus Christi, Texas.
[00:33:55.181 --> 00:33:55.841]  That's a big town.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:17.061]  More, another station in Illinois, another station in Missouri, just we're getting a lot of new affiliates right now and it's really exciting and the stations just get bigger and bigger and better because what we're talking about is just getting more and more mainstream.
[00:34:17.927 --> 00:34:26.570]  I mean, you tune in five years ago and Alex Jones was talking about the NSA spying on you, and FEMA camps, and torture, and how they're training the military to torture, and how they're training to confiscate your guns.
[00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:33.932]  And now, it's really just becoming accepted and mainstream.
[00:34:35.453 --> 00:34:42.375]  So, in a way, as the New World War gets more and more along in its plans, it's easier for us to wake people up.
[00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.616]  I mean, frankly, I don't like being a trailblazer.
[00:34:45.736 --> 00:34:47.377]  I wish we were not in this position.
[00:34:48.468 --> 00:34:51.771]  But now that the enemy is showing their hand, it's getting a lot easier.
[00:34:52.232 --> 00:35:00.800]  The scary things we talk about are public enough now that it's more and more kosher to carry this broadcast.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:12.030]  We're going to play this David Letterman clip from two nights ago here in just a minute or so, and then I'll get into Larry Silverstein and some big new developments there, and then also some great news in New Hampshire.
[00:35:12.754 --> 00:35:23.441]  They're about to pass a law, it looks like it will probably pass, banning gun confiscation, banning illegal search and seizure during a disaster, and saying that it's a felony.
[00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:26.363]  Now, really, it's already on the books that it's a felony.
[00:35:26.443 --> 00:35:28.524]  It's like these politicians don't know what the laws are.
[00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:45.907]  But, simply that New Hampshire, oh by the way, I saw an article, Arizona's talking about reintroducing that law from five years ago, where quote of the government begins gun confiscations or declares a new world order, they'll secede, well that's now being brought forward again.
[00:35:45.967 --> 00:35:51.949]  So, a lot of different things are happening right now, so that's some good news as well.
[00:35:53.289 --> 00:36:02.477]  Former presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, Michael Vadnarik, joining us in studio, coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:36:03.018 --> 00:36:11.125]  And then in the third hour, we are working on getting one of those state reps home from New Hampshire fighting the gun confiscation.
[00:36:12.057 --> 00:36:19.583]  You see, in the past we told you they were coming for your guns, and now there's legislatures introducing laws to stop the feds from taking your guns.
[00:36:20.064 --> 00:36:21.825]  You see, that's how real the threat is.
[00:36:21.905 --> 00:36:24.327]  This is really what they're trying to do.
[00:36:24.347 --> 00:36:30.092]  You don't think they train the military and tell them it's for America over and over again for decades for nothing, do you?
[00:36:30.612 --> 00:36:31.893]  I mean, really.
[00:36:32.253 --> 00:36:40.580]  While you're busy worrying about Muslims, you know, Nosferatu-ing you, meanwhile the New World Order is the real threat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:41.531 --> 00:36:43.652]  But we will get more into that.
[00:36:44.493 --> 00:36:49.315]  Now listen to this clip we're about to play of David Letterman and Bill O'Reilly two nights ago.
[00:36:49.335 --> 00:37:05.504]  Listen to it carefully, because you think that David Letterman is attacking O'Reilly, and he certainly stands up to the arrogant sop who, again, is not a conservative, folks, and is very dishonest.
[00:37:05.544 --> 00:37:09.026]  That's been proven extremely so, and a bullet to boot.
[00:37:09.739 --> 00:37:15.300]  And he thinks that SUVs should be banned, or there should be a tax on them, and that all militia members should be put in camps.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.761]  So, I mean, I've heard him, I've seen him say it, so I'm tired of hearing it.
[00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:28.323]  Basically, he speaks at a very low-grade moron level, and he acts very confident, so that fools a lot of people.
[00:37:28.383 --> 00:37:29.743]  I'd love to get on his show.
[00:37:29.763 --> 00:37:31.804]  I'd clean his clock.
[00:37:32.024 --> 00:37:33.244]  Guaranteed.
[00:37:33.824 --> 00:37:35.584]  He'd shut my mic off and kick me out.
[00:37:36.005 --> 00:37:39.825]  Because he just likes getting little wimps on there that he can berate and bully.
[00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:43.006]  But I digress.
[00:37:43.026 --> 00:37:44.066]  We're about to play this clip.
[00:37:45.086 --> 00:37:48.267]  In this clip... Go ahead and pot that down for a second.
[00:37:48.287 --> 00:37:50.247]  We're not going to play it quite yet.
[00:37:50.328 --> 00:37:58.049]  But in this clip, you will notice that he says, well, I know we've got to support the troops.
[00:37:58.429 --> 00:37:59.669]  Well, I agree with that.
[00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.110]  But what does supporting them mean?
[00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.990]  Good medical care.
[00:38:02.734 --> 00:38:08.456]  Getting them out of a bad situation, making them wear protective gear around DU, not giving them deadly vaccines.
[00:38:08.696 --> 00:38:10.317]  You know, that's just a simple term.
[00:38:10.637 --> 00:38:15.579]  Supporting the troops now means supporting a criminal, lying government, feeding them into a meat grinder.
[00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:20.781]  So then he attaches supporting the troops with, we're going to be there for many, many years.
[00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:24.403]  What country has this government ever invaded that we ever leave?
[00:38:24.723 --> 00:38:25.383]  The Philippines?
[00:38:26.357 --> 00:38:37.789]  Japan, Germany, we're in what, 122 or 120 depending on current deployments, but it hovers right around 120 or so countries.
[00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:44.717]  And I say we never leave, it's really not we, it's the New World Order really never leaves.
[00:38:45.838 --> 00:38:46.958]  And it's a joke.
[00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:49.619]  I mean, this is a global empire, and it's not for our interest.
[00:38:49.879 --> 00:38:50.879]  We're losing our jobs.
[00:38:50.919 --> 00:38:52.119]  We're losing our industrial base.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.921]  They're jacking up our taxes on a hundred fronts while cutting one tax for smoke and mirrors.
[00:38:57.441 --> 00:38:59.721]  You know, what America is, is evaporating.
[00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:03.762]  We're being sucked dry like a spider sucks a big fat caterpillar dry.
[00:39:04.262 --> 00:39:07.163]  The New World Order police state is just the spin of rats.
[00:39:08.004 --> 00:39:09.225]  We're good to go.
[00:39:25.043 --> 00:39:34.110]  And then they let them kind of rot a little bit and let their enzymes seep through the tissue so it's all one delicious kind of Capri Sun drink.
[00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.372]  Kind of like putting a straw in one of those little packets.
[00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:43.457]  So see now they've got us all, they've insanguinated us, but not completely.
[00:39:43.497 --> 00:39:49.241]  The sucking of the fluids is now beginning and some people are seeing the spider for what it is.
[00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:53.224]  They're going, wait a minute, that spider's got fancy PR, but it's still a spider.
[00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:56.426]  Do you really want me to do the spider imitation?
[00:39:59.968 --> 00:40:05.771]  So, he then talks about how, well, I'm against you O'Reilly, but we do need to be there for years and years.
[00:40:05.891 --> 00:40:09.653]  So see, that's a hollow victory, and that's what the Democrats do.
[00:40:09.914 --> 00:40:15.817]  Well, you're an idiot how you handled this Bush, but I agree, we should be there for another ten years, and we should go into Iran.
[00:40:16.797 --> 00:40:17.618]  That's liberal?
[00:40:20.747 --> 00:40:31.031]  But it is fun to see O'Reilly get put in his place, though Letterman did it in a more gentlemanly fashion, because he's obviously got about five times the intellect of Mr. Bully Boy.
[00:40:31.051 --> 00:40:39.534]  And then he makes this comment about how, oh, I'm sure you're smarter than I am, but it just seems to me about 60% of what you say is baloney.
[00:40:39.914 --> 00:40:41.034]  So go ahead and roll that clip.
[00:40:44.075 --> 00:40:45.616]  This is Letterman.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.322]  And with O'Reilly.
[00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:49.062]  Do we have the clip now?
[00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:53.586]  Okay.
[00:40:54.147 --> 00:40:56.369]  You know, you've got to love computers, folks.
[00:40:56.689 --> 00:40:57.409]  We didn't download it.
[00:40:57.429 --> 00:40:58.570]  Are we just attempting to stream it?
[00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:08.679]  We actually have computers that were designed by Mr. Watson, the founder of IBM.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.201]  We have computers that were used in the 1940s.
[00:41:16.093 --> 00:41:17.093]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:41:17.193 --> 00:41:18.133]  Okay, now we'll try again.
[00:41:18.173 --> 00:41:19.094]  Here it is.
[00:41:19.254 --> 00:41:21.294]  The soldiers and Marines are noble.
[00:41:21.774 --> 00:41:22.734]  They're not terrorists.
[00:41:23.354 --> 00:41:30.096]  And when people call them that, like Cindy Sheehan called the insurgents freedom fighters, we don't like that.
[00:41:31.716 --> 00:41:37.157]  It is a vitally important time in American history, and we should all take it very seriously.
[00:41:37.317 --> 00:41:38.577]  Be very careful with what we say.
[00:41:38.977 --> 00:41:41.438]  Well, and you should be very careful with what you say also.
[00:41:51.187 --> 00:41:58.692]  How can you possibly take exception with the motivation and the position of someone like Cindy Sheehan?
[00:41:59.693 --> 00:42:03.495]  Because I believe she's run by far-left elements in this country.
[00:42:03.515 --> 00:42:05.596]  I feel bad for the woman.
[00:42:05.676 --> 00:42:07.918]  Have you lost family members in armed conflict?
[00:42:07.938 --> 00:42:08.518]  No, I have not.
[00:42:08.558 --> 00:42:10.219]  Well, then you can hardly speak for her, can you?
[00:42:10.399 --> 00:42:11.160]  I'm not speaking for her.
[00:42:15.809 --> 00:42:17.350]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.110]  Let's go back to your little red and green stories.
[00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.871]  This is important.
[00:42:20.891 --> 00:42:21.651]  This is important.
[00:42:24.492 --> 00:42:27.673]  Cindy, she lost her son, a professional soldier in Iraq, correct?
[00:42:28.393 --> 00:42:30.014]  She has a right to grieve any way she wants.
[00:42:30.034 --> 00:42:31.614]  She has a right to say whatever she wants.
[00:42:32.454 --> 00:42:34.035]  When she says to the public,
[00:42:34.907 --> 00:42:37.008]  That the insurgents and terrorists are freedom fighters.
[00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:46.412]  How do you think, David Letterman, that makes people who've lost loved ones, by these people blowing the hell out of them, how do you think they feel?
[00:42:47.032 --> 00:42:48.752]  What about their feelings, sir?
[00:42:49.573 --> 00:42:51.794]  Well, what about why are we there in the first place?
[00:42:52.554 --> 00:42:52.954]  We're there...
[00:42:58.246 --> 00:43:04.448]  The President himself, less than a month ago, said we are there because of a mistake made in intelligence.
[00:43:04.908 --> 00:43:06.148]  Well, whose intelligence?
[00:43:07.368 --> 00:43:09.089]  Somebody got off a bus and handed it to him?
[00:43:09.529 --> 00:43:13.370]  No, it was the intelligence gathered by his administration.
[00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.551]  So why are we there in the first place?
[00:43:15.571 --> 00:43:18.551]  I agree with you that we have to support the troops.
[00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:19.832]  They are there.
[00:43:19.892 --> 00:43:22.352]  They are the best and the brightest of this country.
[00:43:22.372 --> 00:43:24.473]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:43:27.236 --> 00:43:31.278]  And I also agree that now we're in it, it's going to take a long, long time.
[00:43:31.338 --> 00:43:34.920]  People who expect it to be solved and wrapped up in a couple of years, it's unrealistic.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.001]  It's not going to happen.
[00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:44.366]  However, however, that does not eliminate the legitimate speculation and concern and questioning of why the hell are we there to begin with?
[00:43:44.866 --> 00:43:53.091]  If you want to question that and then revamp an intelligence agency that's obviously flawed, the CIA, okay?
[00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:53.611]  But remember,
[00:43:54.307 --> 00:43:56.508]  M16 in Britain said the same thing.
[00:43:57.008 --> 00:44:01.549]  Putin's people in Russia said the same thing, and so did Mubarak's intelligence agency in Egypt.
[00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:07.870]  They all make it alright that the intelligence across the board makes it alright that we're there?
[00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:14.091]  I'm very concerned about people like yourself who don't have nothing but endless sympathy for a woman like Cindy Sheehan.
[00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.152]  Honest to Christ!
[00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:15.672]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:44:15.692 --> 00:44:17.632]  Honest to Christ!
[00:44:17.712 --> 00:44:21.573]  No way you're gonna get me.
[00:44:23.197 --> 00:44:27.079]  No way that a terrorist who blows up women and children... Do you have children?
[00:44:27.259 --> 00:44:27.699]  Yes, I do.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.460]  And it's on the same age as yours.
[00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:34.403]  No way a terrorist who blows up women and children is going to be called a freedom fighter on my program.
[00:44:41.247 --> 00:44:49.651]  I'm not smart enough to debate you point to point on this, but I have the feeling... I have the feeling... About 60% of what you say is crap.
[00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:56.640]  Okay, so we're done with that clip.
[00:44:57.561 --> 00:45:04.684]  Now, if you listen to that clip, you notice that they talk about mistakes at the CIA.
[00:45:04.724 --> 00:45:07.166]  They talk about how it was the CIA that did it.
[00:45:07.766 --> 00:45:11.928]  Number one, Dick Cheney made, what, 12 trips to the CIA.
[00:45:11.948 --> 00:45:12.749]  Never before happened.
[00:45:13.689 --> 00:45:20.713]  I mean, a vice president might visit the CIA once during an administration for a press conference or to thank them, but I mean, he was there.
[00:45:21.486 --> 00:45:24.268]  And openly ordering them to produce false intelligence.
[00:45:24.308 --> 00:45:25.529]  That's part of the public record.
[00:45:26.469 --> 00:45:28.250]  Again, that is not debatable.
[00:45:28.791 --> 00:45:35.255]  And they wouldn't do it, so they created their own little intelligence group within the CIA that reported it to the Vice President.
[00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:46.102]  And they had another group reporting, a group of neocons intimately connected with war profiteering in the Pentagon, who would all basically get told what to say by Dick Cheney and the indicted Scooter Libby.
[00:45:46.682 --> 00:45:50.064]  And then they would then churn that back out to the media.
[00:45:50.184 --> 00:45:52.926]  So, number one, the CIA lied on purpose.
[00:45:53.206 --> 00:46:01.231]  Number two, it wasn't the general CIA that did it, but a compartmentalized group of shysters.
[00:46:01.772 --> 00:46:03.873]  So that's a fraud right there.
[00:46:05.094 --> 00:46:08.136]  And then, as Letterman says, we've got to stay there for a long, long time.
[00:46:09.068 --> 00:46:12.251]  And then he says that Cindy Sheehan says she loves the terrorists.
[00:46:12.712 --> 00:46:13.853]  Well, who are the terrorists?
[00:46:13.893 --> 00:46:21.020]  I mean, is somebody who doesn't want to be occupied, who is simply fighting tanks with a rifle, is he a terrorist?
[00:46:22.104 --> 00:46:22.665]  Okay.
[00:46:23.465 --> 00:46:29.989]  If somebody actually blows up a group of Iraqi soldiers and then kills some women, are they a terrorist?
[00:46:30.089 --> 00:46:31.509]  I would say, yeah, that's terrorizing.
[00:46:31.529 --> 00:46:33.771]  That's evil form of warfare.
[00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:35.792]  But what do you think we did to Dresden?
[00:46:35.812 --> 00:46:38.013]  What do you think we did to Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
[00:46:38.033 --> 00:46:41.055]  What do you think those jets and helicopters do right now?
[00:46:41.615 --> 00:46:44.937]  I mean, it's over 100,000 dead Iraqis just since this conflict.
[00:46:45.297 --> 00:46:47.279]  Well, when that happens, oh, it's collateral damage.
[00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:48.440]  It's not terrorism.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.785]  All she said is that, compared to the numbers of dead in America, that this regime is terrorizing Iraq.
[00:46:55.825 --> 00:46:57.126]  And Iraq is under terror.
[00:46:57.467 --> 00:47:08.756]  More torture, more rape rooms than Saddam ever dreamed of, more dead, more power being off, universities shut down, you know, rationing of food.
[00:47:10.457 --> 00:47:10.997]  Everything!
[00:47:12.178 --> 00:47:12.719]  Everything!
[00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:14.380]  It's massive!
[00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:21.486]  So, I mean, by every indice, by every indicator, it is worse.
[00:47:21.586 --> 00:47:22.347]  It is not better.
[00:47:23.448 --> 00:47:29.034]  So, I could make a lot of other points about this, but I'm not going to because we are short on time.
[00:47:29.054 --> 00:47:30.255]  We've got a guest coming up here.
[00:47:30.515 --> 00:47:31.957]  Let's get into Larry Silverstein right now.
[00:47:32.237 --> 00:47:34.720]  This is a great article written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:47:36.008 --> 00:47:39.309]  Silverstein answered WTC Building 7 charges.
[00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:45.312]  Says, Pullet meant to evacuate firefighters, but there were no firefighters in the building.
[00:47:45.672 --> 00:47:55.556]  After nearly two years of steadfast silence, Silverstein Properties have finally responded to questions about what Larry Silverstein meant when he told PBS documentary
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:01.205]  The WTC7 building was pulled in the late afternoon of September 11, 2001.
[00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:07.691]  Building 7 occupied a city block immediately north of the World Trade Center complex.
[00:48:07.711 --> 00:48:10.193]  Photos taken minutes before its collapse showed small fires.
[00:48:10.853 --> 00:48:18.681]  On two or three floors, Building 7 became only the third steel building in history, before or since 9-11, to collapse from fire damage.
[00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:22.024]  The other two are the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center.
[00:48:22.837 --> 00:48:27.479]  Any building that was not owned by Silverstein Properties strangely remained upright.
[00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:41.924]  Photo and video evidence of the collapse shows classic indications of how a controlled demolition, the standard crimp in the center left top of the building, and the subsequent squibs or squips of smoke as it collapses clearly represent
[00:48:42.484 --> 00:48:43.825]  Explosive demolition.
[00:48:43.945 --> 00:48:44.445]  Classic.
[00:48:44.485 --> 00:48:45.385]  Beautiful demolition.
[00:48:45.705 --> 00:48:48.446]  I mean, most controlled demolitions that are public, they don't do it this well.
[00:48:48.746 --> 00:48:49.587]  Tiny pile.
[00:48:49.647 --> 00:48:51.027]  The building fell inward on itself.
[00:48:51.307 --> 00:48:52.228]  Didn't damage buildings.
[00:48:52.248 --> 00:48:53.208]  25 feet away.
[00:48:53.448 --> 00:48:54.108]  I've been there, folks.
[00:48:54.168 --> 00:48:54.749]  It's amazing.
[00:48:55.029 --> 00:48:56.269]  The good job the government did.
[00:48:56.709 --> 00:48:58.610]  Even Dan Rather commenting on the collapse.
[00:48:58.650 --> 00:48:59.750]  We have all these clips coming up.
[00:49:00.031 --> 00:49:06.293]  For CBS News, said that the collapse was reminiscent of those pictures we all saw too much of on television before.
[00:49:06.972 --> 00:49:12.722]  Where a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:18.592]  And then you can also click on the website for about a 30-minute analysis I did personally of it on TV.
[00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:32.228]  Questions about the highly suspicious nature of the building collapse remained comparatively mute until January 2004 when PBS documentary America Rebuilds, originally broadcast in September 2002, received attention across the internet.
[00:49:32.508 --> 00:49:38.593]  The documentary was made infamous for one comment made by Larry Silverstein on the subject of 9-1-1.
[00:49:38.633 --> 00:49:44.197]  Silverstein states, I remember getting a call from the Air and Fire Department telling me that they were not sure they could save the building.
[00:49:44.497 --> 00:49:50.103]  We're going to be able to contain the fire and I said, that's a misquote, let me just, let me just, why read it?
[00:49:50.143 --> 00:49:51.124]  We can just play the clip.
[00:49:51.465 --> 00:49:52.326]  We'll play it when we get back.
[00:49:52.866 --> 00:49:56.731]  And then the next clip is that we know that pull it means to bring down a building.
[00:49:57.412 --> 00:50:16.988]  Because we have a clip from the same show, where a month later they're destroying the buildings that didn't collapse or fall, and they go, getting ready to pull Building 6, and then it cuts to a guy going, when we destroy a building with a controlled demolition, we do this, and he explains that that's what pull it means.
[00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:26.896]  But, you know, I'm trying to hurry through this, and I'm going to end up not having time to do it, because we have a guest coming up, but let me just attempt to here.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:34.643]  For the following year and a half, the Internet and alternative talk of radio was aflame with talk of Building 7 and Silverstein's apparent admission.
[00:50:35.023 --> 00:50:37.784]  For many, it is now the central issue of 9-11.
[00:50:37.984 --> 00:50:41.985]  In June of 2005, this website reported Silverstein's only response to date.
[00:50:42.326 --> 00:50:45.627]  It was an ambiguous comment made to the New York Post journalist Sam Smith.
[00:50:45.987 --> 00:50:53.250]  Silverstein told Smith that he meant something else by pullet comment, but mysteriously refused to elaborate any further.
[00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:59.415]  Silverstein Properties has finally provided a detailed explanation of what Silverstein meant about Building 7 being pulled.
[00:50:59.615 --> 00:51:01.537]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[00:51:02.878 --> 00:51:05.761]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.468 --> 00:51:07.749]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.969 --> 00:51:13.712]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.972 --> 00:51:19.235]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.515 --> 00:51:23.677]  Brace yourselves, as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.857 --> 00:51:27.639]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.899 --> 00:51:32.502]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.602 --> 00:51:38.844]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.904 --> 00:51:40.785]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:41.225 --> 00:51:43.305]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.

[00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.011]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:03.636 --> 00:52:14.908]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:52:15.128 --> 00:52:21.575]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:21.815 --> 00:52:23.096]  To below detectable levels.
[00:52:23.376 --> 00:52:27.318]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:27.539 --> 00:52:34.062]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:34.283 --> 00:52:39.766]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:40.006 --> 00:52:46.932]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:00.423]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.927 --> 00:53:03.267]  I think so.
[00:53:18.152 --> 00:53:18.812]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.688 --> 00:53:50.771]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.951 --> 00:53:56.897]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.082 --> 00:54:07.647]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.009 --> 00:54:21.658]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, we're going to have Michael Bachnerik, who had a really good campaign against the Republican and Democratic candidates as a presidential candidate back in the 2004 election.
[00:54:23.099 --> 00:54:39.072]  He's running against Michael McCaul, the dark horse who appeared out of Tom DeLay's bizarre redistricting, and won here in Austin, Texas, and in the rest of his district, stretching up into Williamson County and south of us.
[00:54:40.237 --> 00:54:46.918]  And I certainly will be supporting Michael Bagnerik against Mr. Michael McCaul, so that is really exciting.
[00:54:46.938 --> 00:54:51.919]  He'll be with us for the full next hour, but I'm going to get in and talk about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, for people that don't know him.
[00:54:51.979 --> 00:54:58.100]  He's really an expert on that, and I think that's more of a compelling reason to vote for him than to hear all of his policies here locally.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:05.581]  I mean, if you're a constitutionalist, then you know automatically that they're going to follow the right policy, but we'll give Michael Bagnerik a chance to talk about some of that as well.
[00:55:05.601 --> 00:55:08.222]  But it'd be good to have another Ron Paul up there in Congress.
[00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:08.622]  That would be
[00:55:09.382 --> 00:55:12.465]  Two of them from Texas, the dynamic duo.
[00:55:13.827 --> 00:55:18.411]  We'll have to see if he'd be as good as Ron Paul, but I'd take something close to Ron Paul.
[00:55:18.431 --> 00:55:22.595]  It would be wonderful, of course, if Ron Paul were a guest with us monthly here on the air.
[00:55:23.015 --> 00:55:25.177]  Larry Silverstein has now responded.
[00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:29.081]  He has finally, after years of not talking, come out.
[00:55:35.473 --> 00:55:52.477]  ...are now saying, through the State Department, the same group that's demonized this show and others on this network, as part of their pathetic efforts to debunk 9-11 research, has posted the response from Silverstein's spokesperson, Dara McQuillan, on its website.
[00:55:52.497 --> 00:55:53.517]  It reads as follows.
[00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:57.478]  Seven World Trade Center collapsed at 5.20 p.m.
[00:55:57.538 --> 00:55:59.059]  on September 11, 2001, after burning for seven hours.
[00:56:01.539 --> 00:56:11.928]  There were no serious casualties thanks to the heroism of the fire department and the work of Silverstein Properties employees who evacuated tenants from the building.
[00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:18.354]  The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, conducted a thorough investigation of the collapse of all the World Trade Center buildings.
[00:56:18.674 --> 00:56:27.021]  The FEMA report concluded that the collapse of World Trade Center 7 was a direct result of fires triggered by debris from the World Trade Center Tower 1.
[00:56:29.269 --> 00:56:31.230]  Break that down in the third hour and disprove all of that.
[00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.551]  We're going to go back into this in the third hour.
[00:56:32.571 --> 00:56:38.834]  On the afternoon of September 11th, Mr. Silverstein spoke to the fire department commander on the site of 7 World Trade Center.
[00:56:39.155 --> 00:56:44.438]  The commander told Mr. Silverstein that there were several firefighters in the building working to contain the fires.
[00:56:44.838 --> 00:56:53.543]  Mr. Silverstein expressed his view that the most important thing was to protect the safety of those firefighters, including if necessary, to have them withdrawn from the building.
[00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:57.284]  Later in the day, the fire commander ordered his firefighters out of the building.
[00:56:57.584 --> 00:56:59.385]  At 5.20 p.m., the building collapsed.
[00:56:59.445 --> 00:57:02.946]  No lives were lost at 7 World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
[00:57:05.026 --> 00:57:11.688]  The State Department website then comments, as noted above, Mr. Silverstein was recounting these events for a television documentary.
[00:57:11.708 --> 00:57:14.829]  He stated, I said, you know, he has a terrible loss of life.
[00:57:15.089 --> 00:57:16.630]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:23.472]  Mr. McQuillan has stated that by it, Mr. Silverstein meant the contingent of firefighters remaining in the building.
[00:57:24.032 --> 00:57:31.554]  The insurmountable problem with this explanation of Silverstein's statement is that there was no firefighters inside WTC7.
[00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:42.658]  Dr. Sham Sunder of the National Institutes of Standards and Technologies, NIST, which investigated the collapse of WTC7, is quoted by Popular Mechanics
[00:57:43.317 --> 00:57:45.259]  Remember, give me a call from the fire department commander.
[00:58:11.408 --> 00:58:13.949]  Telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:58:13.969 --> 00:58:17.551]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:20.532]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:58:21.932 --> 00:58:23.473]  And they made that decision to pull.
[00:58:23.793 --> 00:58:26.874]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[00:58:29.796 --> 00:58:33.957]  And when we come back, we will play the clip of Dan Rather saying it looked like bombs.
[00:58:34.037 --> 00:58:37.859]  And we'll play the clip in the very documentary where they say pull it means blowing a building up.
[00:58:38.179 --> 00:58:39.219]  Then we'll come back in for news.
[00:58:39.259 --> 00:58:40.320]  We've got Michael Bagnerick on.
[00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:46.524]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.254 --> 00:59:02.436]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:03.097 --> 00:59:03.897]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.658 --> 00:59:05.558]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.578 --> 00:59:09.821]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:14.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.723 --> 00:59:25.109]  Alright, for stations that are just joining us in the last hour, we'll talk about a host of issues, including Larry Silverstein through the State Department.
[00:59:25.129 --> 00:59:26.290]  Isn't that fitting through the
[00:59:27.319 --> 00:59:30.442]  known CIA echelon.
[00:59:30.462 --> 00:59:33.644]  I mean, the State Department's even really above that.
[00:59:34.004 --> 00:59:55.981]  But through the highest runes of power in the federal government, Larry Silverstein, the owner of the World Trade Center complex, where a mysterious implosion of three buildings, never before happened, never happened since, he now, years after we've exposed him, years after he slipped up on TV and said that he blew up the building, he said, we pulled it.
[00:59:56.557 --> 01:00:02.701]  And the firefighters are on record saying that as well.
[01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:05.964]  Saying that there were clearly bombs in the buildings.
[01:00:06.004 --> 01:00:09.106]  And all of that evidence, I've made whole films about it.
[01:00:10.013 --> 01:00:11.394]  We've covered this in great detail.
[01:00:11.755 --> 01:00:14.937]  Now, through the State Department, they're saying he meant pull firefighters.
[01:00:15.358 --> 01:00:16.178]  But there's a problem.
[01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:27.407]  The New York Fire Department says, the federal government says, the different agencies that studied the collapse have all said in their reports, firefighters never attempted to put the fires out.
[01:00:27.688 --> 01:00:29.649]  They never entered the building.
[01:00:29.689 --> 01:00:32.251]  It was seen as secondary from the other collapses.
[01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:33.792]  They were in crisis mode.
[01:00:33.813 --> 01:00:39.297]  They didn't even fight the fires in the immediate area in any of seven buildings.
[01:00:39.677 --> 01:00:39.838]  I think?
[01:00:56.633 --> 01:00:59.954]  fell and hit it and knocked out its central support column.
[01:00:59.974 --> 01:01:02.755]  But we have the official video of it collapsing.
[01:01:02.795 --> 01:01:12.118]  We have the official even 9-1-1 commission pattern that's in my film, Martial Law, where they show where the debris fields fell.
[01:01:12.618 --> 01:01:14.279]  Nothing but dust hit Building 7.
[01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:17.860]  I mean, if you've been to downtown Manhattan, it's way down the street, folks.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.080]  I mean, it's far away.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.782]  Buildings like Millennium Hilton and Bankers Trust right up against the towers.
[01:01:24.623 --> 01:01:29.933]  We're either not damaged, or if they had a tower fall on them, it would burn, but nothing collapsed.
[01:01:30.013 --> 01:01:32.598]  I mean, we've been there, we videotaped it, we made a film about it.
[01:01:33.038 --> 01:01:36.104]  So this is all a complete and total fraud.
[01:01:38.509 --> 01:01:39.690]  It just boggles the mind.
[01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:44.831]  So coming up in the third hour, we will get into a lot of detail on this, but we already played Silverstein saying that they pulled it.
[01:01:45.392 --> 01:01:51.594]  Now let's play a clip of Dan Rather, as it collapses, saying that it looks like it's controlled demolition and well-placed dynamite.
[01:01:51.614 --> 01:01:52.034]  Here it is.
[01:01:52.314 --> 01:01:54.475]  Again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[01:01:56.355 --> 01:02:00.197]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:02:00.257 --> 01:02:02.377]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:02:07.582 --> 01:02:10.583]  It's amazing.
[01:02:11.884 --> 01:02:13.984]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:25.689]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:02:29.022 --> 01:02:29.943]  So there's that clip.
[01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:34.145]  Now this next clip is from the same PBS documentary where Silverstein says they pull the building.
[01:02:34.545 --> 01:02:39.308]  This is a month later, when they were pulling down the other buildings that hadn't collapsed.
[01:02:39.608 --> 01:02:45.191]  They're talking about one of the other buildings, and when they have a controlled demolition of it, they call it pulling the building.
[01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:45.812]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:02:46.152 --> 01:02:52.015]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:02:52.516 --> 01:02:52.636]  Hello?
[01:02:58.278 --> 01:03:00.019]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull Building 6.
[01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:05.100]  We have to be very careful how we demolish Building 6.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:14.103]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:03:15.103 --> 01:03:18.624]  And so then they go on to brag how they blew it up just right, and they call it pulling it.
[01:03:19.124 --> 01:03:25.726]  And in the Dictionary of Engineering and Controlled Demolition, pulling means a controlled demolition.
[01:03:26.006 --> 01:03:27.787]  We're going to pull the building.
[01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:35.160]  And in fact, pullet is a subset of doing it with precision to not damage other nearby buildings.
[01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:39.063]  A pullet operation is the most complex.
[01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:40.485]  Which Building 7 was.
[01:03:41.105 --> 01:03:43.247]  Central column is blown, it falls in on itself.
[01:03:43.727 --> 01:03:46.930]  Neat little pile in one nice little pile.
[01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:52.574]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with Michael Bagnerik, presidential candidate, who's now running for Congress.
[01:03:52.894 --> 01:03:53.295]  Stay with us.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.003]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.263 --> 01:03:59.844]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.185 --> 01:04:04.849]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.189 --> 01:04:09.613]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:14.258]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:17.301]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:19.883]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:26.649]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:34.116]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.356 --> 01:04:36.798]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:16.902]  It's Radon 222 and much, much more.
[01:05:17.222 --> 01:05:22.164]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:22.504 --> 01:05:26.506]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:26.706 --> 01:05:31.487]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.

[01:05:54.065 --> 01:05:56.027]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[01:05:56.087 --> 01:05:58.970]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:04.556]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:06:04.797 --> 01:06:06.298]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:06:06.358 --> 01:06:08.601]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:12.345]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:06:12.665 --> 01:06:14.686]  And they can do it without due process.
[01:06:14.746 --> 01:06:18.208]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries.
[01:06:18.329 --> 01:06:21.671]  And now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:27.574]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:35.259]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property or make it look like you own no property and a whole lot more.
[01:06:35.299 --> 01:06:38.301]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.142]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.261 --> 01:07:10.043]  Alright, coming up in the next hour, I want to get into New Hampshire.
[01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:22.131]  They're moving to pass state laws to bar gun confiscation by the federal or local governments in the aftermath of Katrina in New Orleans with the federal gun confiscation operation led by the U.S.
[01:07:22.191 --> 01:07:24.092]  military and the FBI.
[01:07:24.852 --> 01:07:35.179]  We'll also get into Larry Silverstein to the State Department responding to his comments about destroying WTC7 with controlled demolition with a classic pullet.
[01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:37.187]  Uh, controlled demolition.
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:40.612]  So we will get into those huge revelations.
[01:07:40.652 --> 01:07:47.056]  Also, Errol Sharon is in critical condition right now from a second massive stroke.
[01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:50.618]  Also has a hole in his heart and is really playing to life right now.
[01:07:50.638 --> 01:07:57.682]  The 77-year-old hard-charging old war chieftain is holding on by his fingernails.
[01:07:58.002 --> 01:08:05.727]  And some researchers, like Barry Hamish, who's really proven to be very accurate in the past, one of our Israeli friends, says it looks like it may be foul play.
[01:08:06.394 --> 01:08:13.345]  Though I can imagine being overweight at 77 years old and running around working 16 hours a day would also kill you.
[01:08:14.407 --> 01:08:19.035]  I am really honored to have Michael Bagnerik in studio with us for several reasons.
[01:08:20.507 --> 01:08:25.329]  I've known Michael, I guess, about eight, nine years, and he's really been involved in local politics.
[01:08:25.389 --> 01:08:28.290]  He's helped teach Constitution classes for free.
[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.750]  He really knows the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[01:08:31.351 --> 01:08:34.212]  He's done a lot of different local TV shows, radio shows.
[01:08:34.252 --> 01:08:35.612]  He's been involved in the community.
[01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:41.554]  He's helped a lot of people that have had trouble with the corrupt government and the police being out of control.
[01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:58.071]  And then, he came from nowhere, really, just on his eloquence and his understanding of our form of government, and was able to beat out some formidable opponents for a highly contested libertarian presidential nomination.
[01:08:58.571 --> 01:09:03.413]  I mean, this is the guts of what Americana is all about.
[01:09:03.453 --> 01:09:13.056]  I mean, I'm almost calling Jacksonian in that, you know, this guy, grassroots coming from nowhere, and he really injected a lot of important information into the national debate.
[01:09:13.156 --> 01:09:21.259]  And the Libertarian Party really is the only real third party, the only serious one that doesn't, you know, flash in the pan or comment across the night.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.362]  I agree with most of the policies and views of the Libertarian Party.
[01:09:26.402 --> 01:09:31.066]  I'm more of a conservative Libertarian if you had to use the popular lexicon's terms.
[01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:36.749]  I don't think terms are too wide to ever be able to really name an individual with all the diversity.
[01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:44.655]  But he's now running against one of the worst congressmen there is, who was literally installed, and that's Michael McCaul.
[01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:52.146]  Who, of course, is married to the owner of Clear Channel's daughter, and who just so happens to own the voting machines, but we're not going to get off into all that today.
[01:09:53.047 --> 01:09:57.730]  And he's right here running for District 10 against Michael McCall.
[01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:03.575]  We've also had Stahl on, who's running for the State Senate against the corridors and the toll roads and all that.
[01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:06.317]  So we're trying to really... I mean, Texas is the front line.
[01:10:06.657 --> 01:10:10.600]  We are under massive attack, and everything that's happening here is coming to your area.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.442]  So this affects everybody in the country.
[01:10:12.982 --> 01:10:15.224]  And Michael Bagnerik, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:10:15.484 --> 01:10:16.284]  Thanks so much, Jack.
[01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:17.385]  It's good to see you again.
[01:10:18.025 --> 01:10:18.385]  You bet.
[01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:24.327]  It is really exciting to have you here in studio with us today.
[01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:41.413]  Why don't you, Michael, just kind of recap what happened during the Libertarian presidential campaign, and then I want to go through some of your personal views and policies on the toll roads in Texas and the Supreme Court ruling on private property, and then I want to just get into the Constitution itself and the true role of government.
[01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:47.909]  Well, let me first say that I'm honored and very privileged to have been nominated.
[01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:52.992]  There was nobody on the convention floor more surprised than I was.
[01:10:54.013 --> 01:11:00.437]  I had done my best to bring libertarians into the party to help push the ideas forward.
[01:11:01.638 --> 01:11:07.842]  We participated in the presidential debate that Saturday night and the first vote
[01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:17.691]  Gary Nolan, Aaron Russo, and I split the vote, 33% each, and it was very, very dramatic and exciting.
[01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:24.598]  After I won the nomination, John Earhart and I traveled about 75,000 miles by air.
[01:11:25.219 --> 01:11:33.427]  We visited 42 states, I believe, trying to do, I think we totaled up to 400 interviews during that time.
[01:11:34.279 --> 01:11:44.194]  And one thing that was not known, David Cobb of the Green Party and I are both legitimate candidates for legitimate political parties.
[01:11:44.615 --> 01:11:46.718]  We were both arrested in St.
[01:11:46.758 --> 01:11:49.462]  Louis attempting to attend the presidential debate.
[01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.827]  They handcuffed us.
[01:11:52.887 --> 01:11:53.467]  I remember that.
[01:11:53.487 --> 01:11:58.770]  Well, Alan Teese was on the list back in 96 of Republican presidential candidates.
[01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.131]  He was getting about 12% at the time, so they were afraid of him.
[01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:06.574]  They actually kidnapped him, drove him around for an hour, and threw him out in a crack-infested neighborhood.
[01:12:07.394 --> 01:12:08.195]  Did that happen to you?
[01:12:08.315 --> 01:12:08.515]  No.
[01:12:08.675 --> 01:12:10.476]  What they did was, they were very polite.
[01:12:10.896 --> 01:12:12.317]  Once we got through the police line,
[01:12:12.717 --> 01:12:17.199]  They arrested us, handcuffed us, put us into a police van, and left us there.
[01:12:17.319 --> 01:12:23.581]  Well, about 20 minutes later, a police officer came up and said, which one of you guys is a presidential candidate?
[01:12:24.182 --> 01:12:30.964]  And I said, well, we are both presidential candidates, we are at a presidential debate, and you have us in handcuffs.
[01:12:31.024 --> 01:12:32.385]  I said, can you explain that to me?
[01:12:33.129 --> 01:12:35.010]  The guy says, let me get back to you on that.
[01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.972]  Well, Alan Keyes was even on the list.
[01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:42.355]  In fact, they had Nader on and then pulled him just because the Republicans said so and then nothing ever happened.
[01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:43.596]  He wasn't even allowed to be in the audience.
[01:12:43.696 --> 01:12:43.936]  Right.
[01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:47.218]  Well, that's basically what we were trying to do is to be in the audience.
[01:12:47.419 --> 01:12:49.860]  I also was acting as a process server.
[01:12:50.441 --> 01:12:55.924]  The third debate in Arizona was on paid for by tax money on a
[01:12:57.526 --> 01:13:12.575]  tax-funded campus and so the Arizona Libertarians filed a lawsuit and said you either have to let Michael in the debate or shut down the debate and we had this court order that I was going to try to present to the... Oh, that's right!
[01:13:12.615 --> 01:13:15.577]  You even get the courts ordering it and they still ignore it.
[01:13:15.597 --> 01:13:17.358]  That's the thing about the government now.
[01:13:17.398 --> 01:13:18.299]  They just do whatever they want.
[01:13:18.799 --> 01:13:21.302]  I never really got a chance to present that paperwork.
[01:13:21.402 --> 01:13:27.808]  So, the interesting thing as far as I'm concerned... Well, my point is that it had been in the news that you guys had the order.
[01:13:27.928 --> 01:13:29.429]  They knew and they just didn't care.
[01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:31.912]  And, well, it was never advertised.
[01:13:31.952 --> 01:13:36.536]  The fact that David and I had been arrested was only broadcast on my blog and his blog.
[01:13:36.656 --> 01:13:37.337]  We covered it here.
[01:13:37.577 --> 01:13:38.978]  Oh, that's excellent, thank you.
[01:13:39.078 --> 01:13:41.941]  So, we were trying to get that information out.
[01:13:41.961 --> 01:13:46.365]  But you'd think that would be newsworthy, because all over the country they were talking about how they were shutting everybody out of the debate.
[01:13:46.706 --> 01:13:51.130]  How are we going to have a legitimate third party if we can't ever even get people in the debate?
[01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:52.431]  There should be ten guys up there.
[01:13:52.691 --> 01:13:53.232]  Absolutely.
[01:13:53.712 --> 01:13:57.196]  So, it was a very interesting and exciting process.
[01:13:57.296 --> 01:14:00.459]  I'm, again, honored to have been able to represent the Libertarian Party.
[01:14:01.159 --> 01:14:10.082]  And this year, in order to continue lighting the fires of liberty, we've decided the best thing for me to do is to run for Congress in 2006.
[01:14:12.223 --> 01:14:15.024]  Well, that's exciting, and I want to talk about later why you're doing that.
[01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:22.067]  Just out of the gate, I don't think most Americans realize that when we've been saying 6,000 miles of toll roads, it's now 8,000 miles of toll roads.
[01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:22.707]  This is official.
[01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:25.532]  And the whole country only has 7,000 miles of toll roads.
[01:14:25.552 --> 01:14:28.214]  We're going to have transponders and all the inspection stickers.
[01:14:28.554 --> 01:14:30.135]  We narrowly beat that bill last year.
[01:14:30.195 --> 01:14:31.316]  That was going to start this year.
[01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:37.221]  But TxDOT's still moving ahead with this program to turn basically all major roads into toll roads.
[01:14:38.122 --> 01:14:39.363]  It's just massive.
[01:14:39.923 --> 01:14:43.866]  What would you do as a Libertarian Congressman?
[01:14:44.327 --> 01:14:48.570]  I mean, Ron Paul says he's against these tax and track toll roads.
[01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:49.050]  What would you do?
[01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:50.932]  I'm also against them.
[01:14:51.672 --> 01:14:56.236]  Libertarians in general would like to privatize issues.
[01:14:56.556 --> 01:15:09.946]  We don't want to eliminate the decision, we just want to move the decision-making process from Washington, or the state government, into the local county governments, or better, for education, back into the individual homes.
[01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:12.567]  So see, they advertise this as privatization, but it's not.
[01:15:12.928 --> 01:15:20.211]  It's like in Russia, when they pay off the president, and then he just gives an industry to some robber baron, or they call them oligarchs over there.
[01:15:20.571 --> 01:15:30.176]  Then they just, oh, here, you're a foreign Spanish company, we're going to give you our existing roads, and then let you run them and tax people to use them, acting basically as a government entity.
[01:15:30.217 --> 01:15:35.379]  So, I see modern privatization really as simply corporations becoming government.
[01:15:35.419 --> 01:15:36.900]  You don't see that as privatization, do you?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.660]  No, I don't see that as privatization.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:44.502]  And what they generally do is they take a word and then change the definition and then feed it back to you.
[01:15:44.522 --> 01:15:53.583]  So would privatization be if a group of investors got together and bought right-of-ways and built their own toll road and said, if you want to use it, pay us 50 cents?
[01:15:53.643 --> 01:15:54.084]  That's right.
[01:15:54.644 --> 01:15:56.524]  It had to be an investment.
[01:15:56.864 --> 01:16:01.245]  It's not simply the lack of fact that you've elected any of these people.
[01:16:01.883 --> 01:16:15.431]  You know, these people, if the government is giving this monopoly to a particular company, just because you haven't voted for the corporation heads, that doesn't mean that that's a privatized entity.
[01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:23.515]  Then there's the whole mode of how they're going to tax us with a transponder, and they admit that they'll even give you tickets when you speed from radio reader to radio reader.
[01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:27.338]  They admit that they'll be able to track where you're going and what you're doing.
[01:16:27.358 --> 01:16:27.978]  What do you think about that?
[01:16:27.978 --> 01:16:30.819]  Yeah, I think that's an invasion of our privacy.
[01:16:31.479 --> 01:16:36.541]  It is very much that one world order that you're telling people about.
[01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:46.624]  Well, the good news is the majority of Texas counties have now passed resolutions against it and are moving to file lawsuits and block it, so that's good news.
[01:16:46.724 --> 01:16:47.605]  That is good news.
[01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:55.536]  Very, very lucky because I think that the toll road is supposed to pass right through District 10.
[01:16:55.896 --> 01:16:56.137]  Yes.
[01:16:56.397 --> 01:17:01.238]  And the government is going to be using eminent domain to abscond with people's property.
[01:17:01.258 --> 01:17:02.418]  And that goes into my next question.
[01:17:02.478 --> 01:17:10.260]  Yes, the main artery, the main central trunk or hub is I-35 from Mexico up into Canada right through Minneapolis-St.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.660]  Paul, as you know, Michael.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:18.322]  And yes, they're saying that ten miles on each side, they can just take it and then not even pay you just compensation.
[01:17:18.502 --> 01:17:20.443]  That's the new spin in the New London thing.
[01:17:20.483 --> 01:17:24.745]  Not just they're saying, if some private group wants to pay off a politician to take your land, we can take it.
[01:17:25.145 --> 01:17:27.946]  Now it's that we give you what we say the value is.
[01:17:28.206 --> 01:17:28.426]  Right.
[01:17:29.086 --> 01:17:32.328]  And this is one of the things that I debate with people on.
[01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:38.110]  They tell me that the Constitution, specifically the Fifth Amendment, allows eminent domain
[01:17:38.763 --> 01:17:42.825]  But it's the question of, you know, what is just compensation?
[01:17:42.845 --> 01:17:43.885]  And who decides that?
[01:17:44.345 --> 01:17:48.767]  If you're buying something from me, you know, I decide what the cost is.
[01:17:48.787 --> 01:17:50.188]  Best use to demonstrate.
[01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:52.248]  And then you can decide whether you want to pay them.
[01:17:52.308 --> 01:17:53.089]  But they're not even doing that.
[01:17:53.129 --> 01:17:56.410]  They condemn your house and then say, OK, it's only worth the lot value.
[01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:00.952]  Even though you've got a $300,000 house on the books, we're just going to give you lot value.
[01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:10.668]  Within a few weeks of the Supreme Court decision on Kelo versus New London, I got about a dozen anonymous phone calls from across the country.
[01:18:11.429 --> 01:18:17.272]  People know that I'm a constitutional scholar and they were calling to ask, the Supreme Court can't do that, can they?
[01:18:17.953 --> 01:18:20.934]  And realistically, these people already know the answer.
[01:18:20.974 --> 01:18:24.574]  They're just calling me so that I would confirm what they already know.
[01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:27.055]  Let's talk about that in detail and get into the Constitution.
[01:18:27.075 --> 01:18:32.136]  I'm going to spend the bulk of our time together, and if you can today, spend a few minutes into the next hour because we've got you started a little bit later.
[01:18:32.436 --> 01:18:34.736]  Set up some cameras so we can put this on the TV show, Michael.
[01:18:35.057 --> 01:18:42.058]  But I want to specifically, because it's one thing to say the federal government or the state government, and they want to build a hospital or a road, can make you sell.
[01:18:43.139 --> 01:18:46.665]  For a good value of the property.
[01:18:46.925 --> 01:18:49.650]  But what about when private corporations want your land?
[01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.932]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:50.952 --> 01:18:51.333]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.016 --> 01:18:58.460]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:18:58.741 --> 01:19:02.324]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:19:02.464 --> 01:19:10.592]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:19:10.852 --> 01:19:16.478]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:19:16.778 --> 01:19:22.021]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:19:22.281 --> 01:19:24.362]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:19:24.622 --> 01:19:36.788]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:19:37.008 --> 01:19:41.432]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:19:41.653 --> 01:19:42.593]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:19:42.794 --> 01:19:44.415]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:19:44.535 --> 01:19:46.337]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:19:46.597 --> 01:19:47.058]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:47.278]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:19:54.056 --> 01:20:00.278]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:00.738 --> 01:20:08.500]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:16.722]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:17.022 --> 01:20:21.763]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:22.103 --> 01:20:26.807]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:27.327 --> 01:20:31.190]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:32.691]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:32.771 --> 01:20:36.854]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:20:37.274 --> 01:20:41.678]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:20:42.178 --> 01:20:44.680]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:20:53.513 --> 01:21:02.142]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:21:02.362 --> 01:21:13.633]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:21:13.853 --> 01:21:16.496]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:16.836 --> 01:21:23.298]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:21:23.458 --> 01:21:25.318]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:21:25.519 --> 01:21:31.540]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.442]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:57.057]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:57.297 --> 01:21:57.618]  Why?
[01:21:57.638 --> 01:22:00.580]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:05.603]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:22:20.913 --> 01:22:21.313]  We're good to go!
[01:22:42.173 --> 01:22:47.617]  Call 877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com for more information.
[01:22:47.717 --> 01:22:49.378]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:22:49.518 --> 01:22:52.320]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:22:57.968 --> 01:22:59.869]  Alright, we're back with Michael McNairick.
[01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:02.130]  Of course, he was a Libertarian presidential candidate.
[01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:03.150]  Gave him a good run.
[01:23:03.731 --> 01:23:07.212]  And he's now running for Congress, District 10, right here deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:10.734]  Imagine having another Ron Paul, both of them from Texas.
[01:23:11.634 --> 01:23:14.735]  Is Paul's district still called 14 after they rewrote it?
[01:23:14.836 --> 01:23:15.996]  As far as I know, yes.
[01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:20.338]  Yeah, they really wrote it to beat him, but he's saying it's not going to work.
[01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:22.009]  I mean, his own party.
[01:23:22.049 --> 01:23:28.052]  Imagine Ron Paul's own party, the Republicans, riding the district up to give it to the Democrats over him.
[01:23:28.092 --> 01:23:28.292]  Yeah.
[01:23:28.772 --> 01:23:33.454]  And I think they were a little bit surprised when the Democrats did not run a candidate in 2004.
[01:23:33.714 --> 01:23:37.275]  Ron Paul was unopposed, fortunately.
[01:23:37.975 --> 01:23:44.118]  And so we're a little bit interested to see who's going to be running against him in 2006.
[01:23:45.138 --> 01:23:45.798]  Absolutely.
[01:23:46.979 --> 01:23:47.659]  Who's the Democrat?
[01:23:47.679 --> 01:23:48.920]  Who are they trying to run against McCaul?
[01:23:50.893 --> 01:24:02.460]  Against McCaul, we have five Democrats that have recently registered, and they're going to have to go through their primary to decide which of their candidates is going to be the nominee.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.021]  You know, I mean, this is just my advice.
[01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:05.982]  I know Ron Paul would win in Central Texas.
[01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:09.343]  Isn't there any way you can kind of brand yourself as a Ron Paul libertarian?
[01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:10.864]  I'm certainly hoping to.
[01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:13.806]  I want people to know that I'm a Ron Paul with attitude.
[01:24:14.166 --> 01:24:15.727]  I want to go to Washington, D.C.
[01:24:16.087 --> 01:24:17.428]  and really stir things up.
[01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:18.837]  I'd love it.
[01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:20.758]  I mean, Michael, you know what?
[01:24:21.218 --> 01:24:23.219]  Nobody needs to be beaten worse than Michael McCaul.
[01:24:23.239 --> 01:24:24.759]  I don't think people really know his record.
[01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:38.084]  Instead of bashing him all day, our listeners know he's bad news, but I mean, Janet Reno's toady on Waco and a bunch of other horrible stuff, Chinagate, protecting the Chi-Coms, and then now he's this little anti-terror czar up in Congress.
[01:24:38.144 --> 01:24:38.964]  I mean, he's a nightmare.
[01:24:39.264 --> 01:24:41.485]  Well, we're going to be working very, very hard in District 10.
[01:24:42.485 --> 01:24:48.449]  We're beginning a listening tour this month where we're going to go out and talk to the voters.
[01:24:48.609 --> 01:24:51.751]  We want to know what the voters think about Washington government.
[01:24:52.071 --> 01:24:58.315]  What they think about the Texas corridor and all the issues here in Central Texas.
[01:24:58.335 --> 01:25:03.758]  Well I think having a successful presidential candidate, I mean you were successful, got a lot of attention, got a lot of information out to people.
[01:25:03.819 --> 01:25:07.761]  I think that really adds an entree to you and plus you're from right here in Austin.
[01:25:07.961 --> 01:25:12.205]  Well, I think what sets me apart is the fact that I am willing to work so hard.
[01:25:13.005 --> 01:25:18.450]  We have an office staff already who we're putting in 10 to 12 hours a day, and this is just the beginning of the campaign.
[01:25:19.551 --> 01:25:25.336]  We have every intention of walking the district, shaking hands, and meeting as many of the constituents as possible.
[01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:25.997]  Well, we know this.
[01:25:26.037 --> 01:25:29.119]  We know the Democrats are all a bunch of pro-war mongering idiots.
[01:25:29.139 --> 01:25:30.741]  We know they're for big government, gun control.
[01:25:31.361 --> 01:25:32.623]  Michael Bagnerik isn't, are you?
[01:25:32.843 --> 01:25:33.044]  No.
[01:25:33.344 --> 01:25:34.085]  No, absolutely.
[01:25:34.766 --> 01:25:37.009]  Again, we want to reduce the size of government.
[01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:44.118]  If we got rid of the IRS and you got to keep your money, you'd probably do something really silly like spend it.
[01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:47.942]  And do we have small businesses springing up all over the place?
[01:25:47.962 --> 01:25:58.404]  Well, Mike, when this country had a 20% growth rate a year, a hundred and something years ago, we didn't have an income tax and the government had some puny tariffs that were meant just to protect our industries.
[01:25:58.624 --> 01:25:59.045]  That's right.
[01:25:59.105 --> 01:26:00.185]  Why can't we go back to that?
[01:26:00.485 --> 01:26:01.485]  Well, I think that we can.
[01:26:01.765 --> 01:26:05.366]  And that's what I would like to do.
[01:26:05.506 --> 01:26:11.568]  Whatever your job is, you make 100% of your pay and the government takes a certain percentage of it.
[01:26:11.588 --> 01:26:13.108]  And that percentage keeps getting larger.
[01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:17.429]  Well, either you can take your money home, or you can give it to the government.
[01:26:17.929 --> 01:26:19.589]  Who spends your money better?
[01:26:19.749 --> 01:26:22.750]  You, or the government that's supposed to represent you?
[01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:31.172]  Well, the thing is, the government, even in major studies they've had over the last 30 years, that they really get more into their treasury when they lower taxes.
[01:26:31.212 --> 01:26:32.272]  People go, how does that work?
[01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:33.913]  Because the economy speeds up so fast.
[01:26:33.933 --> 01:26:39.814]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50%, and the treasury in one year, the amount of receipts coming in, doubled.
[01:26:40.214 --> 01:26:42.054]  Well, then why do they want to jack them up even more?
[01:26:42.175 --> 01:26:43.355]  It's about control.
[01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:45.335]  They're trying to control the economy.
[01:26:45.695 --> 01:26:51.037]  And if the Federal Reserve can print more money, why do they need to take your taxes if they could just print more?
[01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:52.117]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:26:52.137 --> 01:26:55.878]  The Federal Reserve right now, Michael, is going into overdrive.
[01:26:55.938 --> 01:27:05.240]  The new chairman is saying he's going to print money even faster than Greenspan, and inflation is really at about 10%, but even if it's 5% like they claim it is,
[01:27:06.381 --> 01:27:11.183]  If growth in the economy is 3.4, over a decade you're losing a lot of money.
[01:27:11.204 --> 01:27:12.764]  That is actually recessionary.
[01:27:13.305 --> 01:27:13.845]  Your comments?
[01:27:14.966 --> 01:27:15.426]  I agree.
[01:27:15.446 --> 01:27:19.208]  I think that people need to understand that a little bit more.
[01:27:19.549 --> 01:27:25.973]  But I think that as soon as you start talking about the Federal Reserve, most people on the sidewalk just kind of their eyes glaze over.
[01:27:26.013 --> 01:27:29.135]  It's a little bit too complicated for them as the first thing to talk about.
[01:27:29.235 --> 01:27:33.317]  Maybe you should just tell them the Federal Reserve doesn't like Vince Young.
[01:27:35.296 --> 01:27:39.257]  Well, I just want to tell them that we're going to let them spend their money.
[01:27:40.018 --> 01:27:44.059]  And, you know, let them decide the best way to improve their life.
[01:27:44.099 --> 01:27:46.680]  We get the economy going again, that's good for everybody.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.822]  But I mean, maybe we should just boil it down to like, ugging and grunting, and just say that
[01:27:52.409 --> 01:27:54.891]  Well, I think that the American public is figuring it out.
[01:27:54.992 --> 01:27:58.675]  As I said earlier, after the Supreme Court decision on Kelo v. New London,
[01:28:08.985 --> 01:28:12.908]  We were going to talk about that, now we've got a break again, but I want to get into that when we get back.
[01:28:12.948 --> 01:28:15.731]  What are we going to talk about with that, of the Kelo?
[01:28:15.811 --> 01:28:23.617]  I was just going to point out that people, that decision brought people into the political arena that had never been concerned about politics before.
[01:28:23.878 --> 01:28:25.039]  Oh, you're saying it was a wake-up call?
[01:28:25.079 --> 01:28:31.184]  It was a wake-up call, absolutely a wake-up call, and I think that in the long run that's going to be very helpful to it.
[01:28:31.564 --> 01:28:34.106]  Well, let's go through just your 101 when we get back.
[01:28:34.146 --> 01:28:35.928]  Let's see, you had 5-10 minutes with a group of
[01:28:36.608 --> 01:28:38.871]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:38.891 --> 01:28:40.634]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.364 --> 01:28:56.725]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.966 --> 01:29:00.808]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:01.949]  Read the labels.
[01:29:02.389 --> 01:29:06.511]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:06.731 --> 01:29:10.914]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:11.294 --> 01:29:16.157]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:16.537 --> 01:29:20.119]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:20.319 --> 01:29:25.663]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.923 --> 01:29:28.664]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.965 --> 01:29:29.865]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:29:53.925 --> 01:30:00.150]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:06.475]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.755 --> 01:30:15.182]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.442 --> 01:30:22.448]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.748 --> 01:30:27.571]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.

[01:31:56.504 --> 01:32:02.048]  Okay, I want to now, with Michael Bagnerich, get into the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:03.289 --> 01:32:07.353]  About five, six years ago, he did a video presentation, which I've got to get a copy of.
[01:32:07.373 --> 01:32:15.379]  I ought to call my friend Chris Athanas and get a copy of that that he produced for local TV and maybe even sell it out of the office or something once I approach him about it, but we never did anything.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.602]  It's just an hour-long program where Michael Bagnerich
[01:32:19.262 --> 01:32:26.368]  is sitting there in the backyard at a table going through the Constitution, but then Christopher Annis built all these graphics to explain it and how it works.
[01:32:26.428 --> 01:32:31.333]  And at the end of it, I mean, just a layman will really understand how beautiful it is, how important it is.
[01:32:31.973 --> 01:32:46.766]  Red Beckman, in years past, one of the granddaddies of this movement for liberty, rediscovering liberty, you know, he had like four or five hour seminars he would go over explaining, you know, the role of the people above the government, not the people below the government.
[01:32:47.487 --> 01:32:50.569]  In a situation where you're a slave, the government is above you.
[01:32:51.009 --> 01:32:53.631]  And they're officials, they're authorities.
[01:32:54.251 --> 01:32:57.013]  And then down here, we're their minions.
[01:32:57.053 --> 01:33:00.236]  But in a free society, they're servants, and we're the sovereigns.
[01:33:00.396 --> 01:33:03.478]  But we'll talk about that in a few minutes before we go back to Michael Bagnerik.
[01:33:03.518 --> 01:33:09.382]  And later, he's going to be with us some into the next hour, and we'll take a few phone calls if you'd like to talk to him at 1-800
[01:33:11.807 --> 01:33:12.287]  259-9231.
[01:33:13.448 --> 01:33:15.890]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:20.752]  But before we go back to Michael Bagneri, this is the last few days.
[01:33:21.133 --> 01:33:24.214]  On Sunday, we're going to take the specials down.
[01:33:24.835 --> 01:33:27.936]  You can get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:33:28.077 --> 01:33:33.620]  All 14 of my films, all my weekly TV reports, all my special interviews that we're doing here in studio.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.322]  Not only now will you get the weekly TV reports we do,
[01:33:38.474 --> 01:33:44.260]  But you'll also get at least every week at least one person we're going to interview in studio.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:51.366]  You'll get the video of that with documents and with information posted within that little mini documentary.
[01:33:51.586 --> 01:33:54.589]  In fact, we're videotaping this with a two-camera shoot right now.
[01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:57.471]  That's going to be on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:57.952 --> 01:34:04.558]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other books and videos we've posted and authorized to post.
[01:34:05.258 --> 01:34:06.899]  It's normally 15 cents a day.
[01:34:07.039 --> 01:34:08.580]  You can get a monthly subscription for $5.95.
[01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:11.182]  But we have yearly subscriptions.
[01:34:11.482 --> 01:34:14.043]  Well, right now you get 5 plus months.
[01:34:14.063 --> 01:34:16.265]  5.3 months is what it comes out to.
[01:34:16.965 --> 01:34:19.106]  Free when you get a yearly subscription.
[01:34:19.126 --> 01:34:22.748]  That's only going for about 3 or 4 more days.
[01:34:22.868 --> 01:34:24.869]  So go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a membership.
[01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:27.451]  Or, if you want a hard copy,
[01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:35.512]  Of my new film, Martial Law, that exposes who was really behind 9-11, and what the Globalist Master Plan is, and the latest police state developments.
[01:34:35.572 --> 01:34:39.113]  It's a mini-series, three hours long, on one DVD or one VHS.
[01:34:39.493 --> 01:34:43.914]  Now we've got specials running on that until next week, the first of next week.
[01:34:44.214 --> 01:34:46.975]  We have specials on my new film, The Order of Death.

[01:34:52.836 --> 01:34:55.357]  Two films on one DVD for one price.

[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.120]  It's all up on Infowars.com.

[01:35:15.844 --> 01:35:22.767]  So you're really contributing to the frontline fight against the globalists and their world government program of enslavement.
[01:35:23.127 --> 01:35:29.355]  So again, InfoWars.com to get hard copies, or PrisonPlanet.tv, or call toll free to get my documentaries at 1-888-

[01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:35.871]  That's 888-253-3-1-3-9.
[01:35:35.891 --> 01:35:41.035]  Please take advantage of that.
[01:35:41.355 --> 01:35:44.578]  Michael Bagnerik, again, former presidential candidate on the Libertarian ticket in 2004.
[01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:48.181]  Their last major candidate, one of their most successful.
[01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:49.822]  Now running for Congress.
[01:35:49.842 --> 01:35:52.544]  I think he has a shot at it against Michael McCaul, District 10.
[01:35:53.204 --> 01:35:56.387]  And that's up, you know, from Georgetown down south of Austin.
[01:35:57.428 --> 01:35:59.250]  It is the Central Capital District.
[01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:00.852]  He'd be another Ron Paul.
[01:36:00.892 --> 01:36:04.095]  His policies are excellent up there on the Hill.
[01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:04.896]  We need him.
[01:36:05.157 --> 01:36:17.090]  Before we get into the Constitution, and you really are a constitutional scholar and you teach those classes, which makes you the right man for the job, tell us about your website, your campaign, how folks get involved.
[01:36:17.965 --> 01:36:19.205]  The website is very easy.
[01:36:19.286 --> 01:36:21.146]  It's badnarik.org.
[01:36:21.306 --> 01:36:25.628]  B-A-D-N-A-R-I-K dot O-R-G.
[01:36:26.468 --> 01:36:32.810]  And you can go there, find out our address, our phone number.
[01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:34.430]  Our phone number is 512-637-6860.
[01:36:34.450 --> 01:36:39.292]  And if you live... Well, we are making this a nationwide campaign.
[01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.896]  We want people to call in from all 50 states.
[01:36:49.817 --> 01:36:57.622]  Ron Paul gets contributions from all 50 states, and we're hoping to do very close to the same thing.
[01:36:57.762 --> 01:37:03.005]  Well, it's going to take money to go after the Chi-Com's operative, Michael McCall.
[01:37:05.387 --> 01:37:07.969]  Give that website out again, and please give us that phone number again.
[01:37:08.509 --> 01:37:11.391]  The website is badnarek.org, B-A-D-N-A-R-E-K.
[01:37:13.312 --> 01:37:18.313]  N A R I K dot O R G and the phone number is 512-637-6860.
[01:37:18.573 --> 01:37:30.736]  And we've got a link to it up on InfoWars.com, but will you spell out Bagnart for us?
[01:37:31.156 --> 01:37:36.577]  Yes, B as in boy, A, D as in dog, N A R I K.
[01:37:37.688 --> 01:37:41.690]  Folks, you need to go to Infowars.com if you didn't write that down or if you missed that address.
[01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:47.953]  We have a big link to it right there in the guest section on the front page to Michael Bagnerik's website.
[01:37:48.793 --> 01:37:51.114]  Now, we've got some time in this segment.
[01:37:51.154 --> 01:37:54.916]  Let's go through, for those that don't know, I know most of our audience is pretty well educated,
[01:37:55.476 --> 01:38:16.971]  I mean, there's so much to know about the Founding Fathers, the struggle, why America was different, what a republic is, and then maybe talk about the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, some of the things that are really under attack right now, and where Washington has gone wrong, because Washington just announces itself as God, and so many people think, well, if they say they're God, they must be.
[01:38:17.451 --> 01:38:20.073]  Well, I think the best thing to do is to go back to the beginning.
[01:38:21.143 --> 01:38:23.845]  We have a problem with, you know, which came first, chicken or the egg.
[01:38:24.106 --> 01:38:28.489]  But we do not have a problem with which came first, the people or Congress.
[01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:30.891]  Obviously, the people came first.
[01:38:31.211 --> 01:38:32.672]  We invented Congress.
[01:38:33.172 --> 01:38:40.878]  And Article 1, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution says that all powers herein granted
[01:38:41.798 --> 01:38:45.661]  The power that Congress has is granted to them by the people.
[01:38:46.461 --> 01:38:48.202]  Government has privileges.
[01:38:48.363 --> 01:38:50.564]  We, the people, have rights.
[01:38:51.064 --> 01:38:52.125]  And you need to know the difference.
[01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:57.229]  Anyone who denies that need only look to the preamble of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.949]  Right.
[01:38:58.369 --> 01:39:03.493]  We have the right to alter or abolish any government that is violating our rights.
[01:39:04.273 --> 01:39:05.494]  But we're also compelled.
[01:39:05.534 --> 01:39:06.095]  It's our duty.
[01:39:06.455 --> 01:39:09.317]  Yes, later in the Declaration it does say that.
[01:39:11.319 --> 01:39:17.491]  The foundation of my Constitution class is the difference between rights and privileges.
[01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:21.800]  A right is something that you can do without asking for permission.
[01:39:22.521 --> 01:39:27.504]  A privilege, on the other hand, is something that someone of a higher authority allows you to do.
[01:39:27.885 --> 01:39:33.248]  So a right is organic and springs from the wellspring of human life and this planet.
[01:39:33.788 --> 01:39:35.490]  I mean, we have the right to not be slaves.
[01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:37.871]  We have the right to defend ourselves if someone's trying to kill us.
[01:39:37.991 --> 01:39:38.612]  Absolutely.
[01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:43.635]  We have the right to not go be slaves in the military.
[01:39:43.775 --> 01:39:45.996]  Well, to put it simply, we have the right to be left alone.
[01:39:46.457 --> 01:39:46.637]  Yes.
[01:39:47.277 --> 01:39:49.578]  So, we the people have rights.
[01:39:49.698 --> 01:39:53.419]  We gave certain limited privileges to the government.
[01:39:53.439 --> 01:39:55.579]  The government works for us, not the other way around.
[01:39:56.119 --> 01:39:59.780]  They have limited powers that they've been delegated by us, their bosses.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:00.561]  Absolutely.
[01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:04.742]  Now, you and I both know that they haven't paid attention to the Constitution.
[01:40:04.762 --> 01:40:05.722]  I doubt that they've read it.
[01:40:06.374 --> 01:40:12.818]  They've usurped it aggressively and are now trying to perfect a total despotism.
[01:40:13.098 --> 01:40:13.658]  Absolutely.
[01:40:14.199 --> 01:40:16.520]  So, simple examples.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:22.183]  I will wager none of your listeners has a church permit.
[01:40:23.364 --> 01:40:30.008]  Nobody within the sound of our voice has filled out a government form that allows them to exercise their religion.
[01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:34.597]  Because religion is... we have a right to freedom of religion.
[01:40:35.178 --> 01:40:39.524]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:40:39.704 --> 01:40:40.385]  Absolutely.
[01:40:40.846 --> 01:40:44.712]  And if you ask somebody for their church permit, they look at you like you've grown another head.
[01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.071]  Well, that's the way the First Amendment works.
[01:40:47.251 --> 01:40:56.196]  Well, if that's true, then why do you or I have to get a concealed carry permit in order to exercise our right to keep and bear arms?
[01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:56.876]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:40:56.896 --> 01:41:01.258]  We think it's a victory to get a concealed carry, and after two years, crime in every state drops by around 20%.
[01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:02.079]  You know, some states 18, some 25.
[01:41:02.119 --> 01:41:02.819]  Florida's like 25, we're about 20%.
[01:41:06.141 --> 01:41:22.829]  People think, well, at least crime's going down, I can carry a gun, but wait a minute, they've now turned a right into a privilege, you're acquiescing, and by color of law, possession is nine-tenths of the law, by the basic custom, you are now creating a false common law that it is a privilege.
[01:41:22.869 --> 01:41:23.249]  That's right.
[01:41:23.389 --> 01:41:27.111]  It's kind of a de facto law, it's just the way everybody assumes that it is.
[01:41:27.572 --> 01:41:30.473]  I guess I could have just shortened my whole diagraph and said color of law.
[01:41:30.593 --> 01:41:30.813]  Yeah.
[01:41:33.899 --> 01:41:39.341]  One of the big things that happened last year was the Supreme Court decision on Kelo versus New London.
[01:41:39.982 --> 01:41:47.965]  The whole purpose of the Constitution and the government that it creates is to protect your life, your liberty, and private property.
[01:41:48.525 --> 01:41:56.288]  And the Kelo decision basically struck that down, reversed everything, and said the government can take your property pretty much for anything it wants.
[01:41:57.271 --> 01:42:06.404]  And as I said earlier, I had about a dozen anonymous phone calls, people calling me up to confirm that, I mean, the Supreme Court's not supposed to be able to do that.
[01:42:07.045 --> 01:42:09.948]  Well, they do it because they can get away with it.
[01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:14.655]  We the people need to stand up and we need to, we need to understand the Constitution.
[01:42:15.296 --> 01:42:24.044]  We need to understand what privileges we have given the government so that when the government violates those privileges, we can call them to task.
[01:42:24.424 --> 01:42:25.125]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:42:25.145 --> 01:42:27.627]  I mean, a citizen's rulebook, and you've got one right here.
[01:42:27.727 --> 01:42:31.251]  You've got the United States Constitution, you know, right here.
[01:42:31.831 --> 01:42:32.752]  It's so simple.
[01:42:32.812 --> 01:42:34.393]  I mean, this is what America is.
[01:42:35.294 --> 01:42:35.854]  Absolutely.
[01:42:36.215 --> 01:42:45.079]  And the average person, they know all about Vince Young's passing record, they know all about the Dallas Cowboys, which, fine, if you want to know about that, know about it.
[01:42:45.399 --> 01:42:49.801]  Why I get angry is, though, they know nothing about the playbook of America.
[01:42:50.061 --> 01:42:50.701]  That's right.
[01:42:50.981 --> 01:43:00.525]  But they'll tell you they've got rights all day, they'll tell you it's a free country, but then I know, because I've researched this in depth, and you know because you've researched it, they're totally violating it.
[01:43:00.545 --> 01:43:01.446]  I mean, the new London
[01:43:02.319 --> 01:43:05.281]  Supreme Court ruling for those that don't know, and I want you to elaborate on this.
[01:43:05.961 --> 01:43:07.402]  But we've interviewed the parties involved.
[01:43:07.442 --> 01:43:14.926]  The big secret is, as I said earlier, they don't just take your property, they then don't even give you what it says on the tax rolls it's worth.
[01:43:15.226 --> 01:43:20.189]  And normally, best use could be anywhere from three to ten times what the tax roll says.
[01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:27.073]  But $300,000 houses, $307,000 in one case, they go, well we'll give you $50,000 because of a lot price.
[01:43:27.493 --> 01:43:35.838]  But if you fight us in court, this happened five years ago, we're then going to charge you back taxes on rent of your own property and you won't get anything.
[01:43:36.138 --> 01:43:40.621]  And we'll actually put a lien on you for taxes and say you owe us money.
[01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:43.503]  So you're going to owe us money because we're going to take your house.
[01:43:43.523 --> 01:43:44.543]  These are nice homes.
[01:43:45.564 --> 01:43:47.405]  And the New London case specifically,
[01:43:48.431 --> 01:44:11.690]  said that if a local politician wants to just give your land or say they're going to give your land to some local private developer because he can do something better with it and quote pay more taxes that goes back to the Queen saying I'm gonna take your noble lands and give it to another noble because he says he can do more for me I mean that is that not classical feudalism?
[01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:12.551]  Absolutely!
[01:44:13.051 --> 01:44:13.571]  Absolutely.
[01:44:13.851 --> 01:44:17.233]  And again, once people start to recognize that, and I think they are.
[01:44:17.533 --> 01:44:19.013]  That's why I'm optimistic.
[01:44:19.494 --> 01:44:28.997]  I think the average person on the street is starting to understand just how vast the usurpation of government power has been.
[01:44:29.017 --> 01:44:31.818]  I mean, your listeners have been following you for a long time.
[01:44:31.878 --> 01:44:33.499]  They know most of these details.
[01:44:33.979 --> 01:44:36.640]  The thing is that your average person on the street
[01:44:37.288 --> 01:44:43.254]  is starting to pick up on that and... But we've now got about ten new affiliates in the last two weeks, so we've got a lot of new listeners.
[01:44:43.294 --> 01:44:44.315]  Boil it down for them.
[01:44:46.076 --> 01:44:49.459]  The purpose of the Constitution and the government is to protect your property.
[01:44:49.819 --> 01:44:50.340]  They're not.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.842]  They're taking your property, they're not even paying you for it.
[01:44:54.083 --> 01:45:02.311]  We just had the President admit on television not long ago that, oh yes, we are spying on people inside the United States and well
[01:45:02.731 --> 01:45:08.855]  We didn't get a warrant because that was really kind of a nuisance for us, but it was in your best interest, so just trust me.
[01:45:08.875 --> 01:45:11.776]  But then I had a problem with the FISA Court where they can come back in a month.
[01:45:11.816 --> 01:45:13.397]  That isn't even really a real warrant either.
[01:45:13.517 --> 01:45:14.338]  I understand that.
[01:45:14.498 --> 01:45:16.359]  Now rubber stamps aren't even good enough.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.821]  It is absolutely horrendous.
[01:45:18.901 --> 01:45:25.945]  I think the American people are waking up to all this, and I am hoping that the system starts to
[01:45:26.765 --> 01:45:28.166]  Expose itself for what it is.
[01:45:28.366 --> 01:45:39.333]  Why do you think the elite right now, Michael Bagner, that own the Republicans and Democrats, like so much change in their pocket, why do you think they're even dispensing with, you know, they kind of left some of the trappings of America there.
[01:45:39.413 --> 01:45:40.794]  We all knew it was already gone.
[01:45:41.094 --> 01:45:43.155]  Now we're trying to restorate, get it back.
[01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:43.515]  Right.
[01:45:44.196 --> 01:45:45.356]  I've heard you say that many times.
[01:45:45.757 --> 01:45:49.419]  How then, I mean, why is the elite just so arrogant right now?
[01:45:50.635 --> 01:45:51.476]  I don't know that.
[01:45:51.736 --> 01:45:55.659]  I wish I did understand why they think the things they do.
[01:45:55.719 --> 01:45:59.021]  I think it would help us to defeat them at the polls.
[01:46:00.122 --> 01:46:04.285]  My job right now is just to take this message to the people in District 10.
[01:46:05.246 --> 01:46:08.248]  Again, we are going to be walking the district, shaking hands with people.
[01:46:08.388 --> 01:46:12.731]  I want to get to know what people think, get an opportunity to talk to them.
[01:46:12.931 --> 01:46:14.232]  This is not rocket science.
[01:46:14.272 --> 01:46:15.673]  This is really simple stuff.
[01:46:16.034 --> 01:46:17.895]  Why do they think they can get away with it?
[01:46:18.641 --> 01:46:25.746]  I guess they've gotten away with so much more in the past that... I don't know, but I'm not going to let them do it.
[01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:28.708]  I'm going to basically, you know, win this election.
[01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:31.330]  I'm going to become the first Libertarian in Congress.
[01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:33.372]  I'm going to be there to back up Ron Paul.
[01:46:34.232 --> 01:46:39.976]  And I think that when I win, this is going to shake up the political community.
[01:46:40.457 --> 01:46:46.381]  Americans across the nation are going to understand that they do have a choice that Libertarians can win.
[01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:53.128]  And I think that this is going to be the beginning of restoring the republic that you and I love so much.
[01:46:54.665 --> 01:46:58.248]  Well, I tell you, I mean, all over the country people are ready.
[01:46:58.528 --> 01:47:03.293]  I mean, there are a bunch of states introducing legislation to secede right now in the North, the South.
[01:47:03.313 --> 01:47:05.294]  I mean, there's wild stuff happening.
[01:47:05.314 --> 01:47:14.743]  We need to make sure that serious professional people like yourself are leading this instead of the buffoons the media tries to so often focus in on.
[01:47:15.083 --> 01:47:16.724]  What about the Second Amendment, Michael?
[01:47:16.744 --> 01:47:21.629]  We saw actual gun confiscation of even the undamaged areas, the unflooded areas,
[01:47:22.309 --> 01:47:29.355]  The Army's first mission, with the FBI leading them, and this is all on national news, was to come in and go into rich people's homes, even.
[01:47:29.395 --> 01:47:32.277]  I say that because, you know, the poor folks are usually who they do this to.
[01:47:32.578 --> 01:47:39.403]  Now it's, we're going into the million-dollar houses, we're going to put you down in the dirt, take your guns, and then let you stay in your house where you can't defend yourself.
[01:47:39.443 --> 01:47:42.366]  What would you do as a congressman if you saw that happening?
[01:47:42.506 --> 01:47:47.630]  Well, I would make the announcement that 20,000 gun laws in the United States are unconstitutional.
[01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:52.552]  Because they infringe on your right to self-defense and the right to defend your children.
[01:47:54.173 --> 01:47:57.094]  Self-defense is a natural right.
[01:47:57.454 --> 01:48:00.675]  Everybody has... It is the most base right.
[01:48:00.815 --> 01:48:02.696]  Only slaves are not allowed to defend themselves.
[01:48:02.716 --> 01:48:03.096]  That's right.
[01:48:03.696 --> 01:48:07.718]  And one of the reasons that I left California and moved to Texas
[01:48:08.058 --> 01:48:17.384]  It was because the California legislature passed 18 anti-gun laws, six of which would turn me into a felon overnight.
[01:48:17.444 --> 01:48:18.725]  That was a decade ago or so.
[01:48:18.745 --> 01:48:20.366]  That was about February and March of 1997.
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:31.947]  You know, I have always said that I am not going to turn over my guns to any state or federal authority, period.
[01:48:32.367 --> 01:48:37.232]  We need to retain the right to defend ourselves and the right to defend our country.
[01:48:37.953 --> 01:48:42.678]  And any government official that is trying to take your guns away from you is trying to make you a victim.
[01:48:44.207 --> 01:48:45.328]  Well, I mean, it's crazy.
[01:48:45.688 --> 01:48:48.570]  I mean, imagine going to the cops and telling them, give us your guns.
[01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:49.371]  We're not saying that.
[01:48:49.411 --> 01:48:50.712]  They should be able to defend themselves.
[01:48:51.072 --> 01:48:52.293]  Why do they want my guns?
[01:48:52.373 --> 01:48:58.318]  I know most police say they don't want our guns, but I mean, we saw in New Orleans and now in L.A., they're banning a lot of guns.
[01:48:58.338 --> 01:48:59.679]  San Francisco's outright banned them.
[01:48:59.939 --> 01:49:03.902]  We have Republican governors from Schwarzenegger to Pataki going after guns.
[01:49:03.922 --> 01:49:06.464]  We have Mayor Bloomberg saying he's declared war on guns.
[01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:11.013]  And I mean, how does that keep me safe when the cop pulls me over and has to search my car for guns?
[01:49:11.033 --> 01:49:11.874]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:12.814]  It is a joke.
[01:49:13.315 --> 01:49:22.482]  And statistically, any time you have strong gun control, such as Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, you also have high crime and murder.
[01:49:23.087 --> 01:49:32.381]  In all the places where people are allowed to carry guns and defend themselves, the crime rate is very low or drops precipitously as soon as they pass the law.
[01:49:32.441 --> 01:49:33.222]  Well, exactly.
[01:49:33.262 --> 01:49:37.989]  In England, after they confiscated guns about a decade ago,
[01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:41.293]  Every year the crime rate doubles until now.
[01:49:41.693 --> 01:49:45.396]  In international statistics, they have a much higher crime rate than America.
[01:49:45.416 --> 01:49:47.158]  They're number one industrialized Asians.
[01:49:47.458 --> 01:49:48.479]  We're number 14.
[01:49:49.059 --> 01:49:50.981]  Only Switzerland is safer than the U.S.
[01:49:51.301 --> 01:49:53.203]  But the mainstream media won't tell you those numbers.
[01:49:55.024 --> 01:50:02.386]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.667 --> 01:50:07.408]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.628 --> 01:50:13.270]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:18.011]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.251 --> 01:50:25.412]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.432 --> 01:50:26.212]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:29.953]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.133 --> 01:50:32.654]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.874 --> 01:50:39.575]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:39.815 --> 01:50:45.080]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:45.520]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.931 --> 01:51:01.437]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.718 --> 01:51:12.647]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.887 --> 01:51:14.709]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:51:14.969 --> 01:51:18.292]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:51:18.632 --> 01:51:29.081]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:51:29.381 --> 01:51:29.881]  That's right!
[01:51:30.061 --> 01:51:37.165]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:37.465 --> 01:51:41.587]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:51:41.747 --> 01:51:46.209]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:46.269 --> 01:51:46.710]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.879 --> 01:51:56.199]  I think so.
[01:52:11.104 --> 01:52:11.764]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.702]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.882 --> 01:52:49.886]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.909 --> 01:53:00.052]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.733 --> 01:53:03.094]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:04.075 --> 01:53:08.938]  Former presidential candidate, Libertarian Party, really one of the only serious third parties out there.
[01:53:10.067 --> 01:53:12.948]  And now the third largest office-holding party in the country.
[01:53:14.528 --> 01:53:21.489]  He's now running for District 10 right here in Central Texas against Michael McCaul, who really is one of the worst Congressmen we have.
[01:53:21.529 --> 01:53:30.591]  He is a horrible police state minion, maven, pusher, pimp, whatever you want to call him, and he's really got to be stopped.
[01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:35.352]  And so be sure to go to InfoWars.com and link through to Bagnerik.
[01:53:36.781 --> 01:53:42.604]  We're going to start the third hour here in a few minutes and we're going to take calls.
[01:53:43.164 --> 01:53:45.545]  Jason, Stuart, Tim, Joe, Pat and many others.
[01:53:45.926 --> 01:53:47.486]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:47.506 --> 01:53:51.629]  We're going to cycle through your calls quickly.
[01:53:51.849 --> 01:53:56.571]  We hit that break and you were still going about, because you don't have your headset on yet.
[01:53:56.671 --> 01:53:58.312]  We'll do that when you take the calls.
[01:53:59.244 --> 01:54:04.747]  We hit that break and you were still going about the Second Amendment and using the Kennesaw, Georgia example?
[01:54:04.847 --> 01:54:05.107]  Right.
[01:54:05.728 --> 01:54:06.808]  I was just contrasting.
[01:54:06.869 --> 01:54:10.250]  All the cities that have gun control have high crime.
[01:54:11.031 --> 01:54:14.173]  Kennesaw, Georgia is a small town just northwest of Atlanta.
[01:54:15.294 --> 01:54:21.138]  And several years ago, they passed a law that requires a homeowner to have a gun.
[01:54:21.198 --> 01:54:32.026]  Now, they've never arrested anybody for not having a gun, but it was interesting that as soon as they passed this law saying that, you know, homeowners have to have a gun, home invasions in that city dropped by 90%.
[01:54:33.547 --> 01:54:36.909]  Nobody's crawling through anybody's window anymore because you could get hurt.
[01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:41.973]  By the way, I've had their police chief on, I've had their mayor on, and that's true.
[01:54:41.993 --> 01:54:42.914]  It was actually, I believe, 92%
[01:54:45.277 --> 01:54:50.600]  So it's even better, and the only reason I know that is because we have a section on the website about it.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:57.864]  But imagine, they were having a crime wave because all the crime was coming in from Atlanta, and now it's non-existent.
[01:54:57.904 --> 01:54:58.665]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:54:59.425 --> 01:55:00.306]  Take Texas here.
[01:55:01.158 --> 01:55:03.959]  The criminals go into the inner city areas where they know people aren't armed.
[01:55:04.439 --> 01:55:08.160]  They would never try to just go into somebody's house when people are there.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.340]  It's very rare because you do that, you die.
[01:55:10.661 --> 01:55:11.181]  Absolutely.
[01:55:11.421 --> 01:55:21.103]  I mean, you know, right here in this safe next to me, I've got it's a safe so nobody can get into it but me, I mean right now somebody comes in here and tries to harm me or my staff, it's bye-bye.
[01:55:21.763 --> 01:55:23.924]  And that's not a bad thing, that's good.
[01:55:24.224 --> 01:55:24.964]  It's a good thing.
[01:55:25.284 --> 01:55:27.465]  Everybody has a survival instinct.
[01:55:28.286 --> 01:55:32.809]  I talked to women who say they would do anything to protect their children.
[01:55:33.389 --> 01:55:41.253]  And I said, well, if you have someone crawling through the window at 2 o'clock in the morning with a bloody machete, would you take a gun and use it to protect your children?
[01:55:41.493 --> 01:55:43.314]  They said, oh no, that's dangerous.
[01:55:43.715 --> 01:55:47.417]  Well then, clearly, you would not do anything to protect your children.
[01:55:47.477 --> 01:55:53.640]  Why would you give up the one tool that would allow you to protect your children efficiently and safely?
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.121]  Well, that's the crazy thing.
[01:55:55.161 --> 01:55:57.062]  There was the famous case five years ago.
[01:55:57.082 --> 01:56:01.484]  These cases we see every week, but I interviewed some of the family and people involved as they cried on air.
[01:56:01.905 --> 01:56:05.367]  Remember the pitchfork murderer in Central California?
[01:56:05.387 --> 01:56:08.368]  He was the next-door neighbor, but he went crazy in a middle-class neighborhood.
[01:56:09.369 --> 01:56:11.890]  And the 14-year-old girl was a championship shooter.
[01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.250]  Yes.
[01:56:12.951 --> 01:56:14.091]  She was getting ready for the Olympics.
[01:56:14.512 --> 01:56:16.033]  They were grooming her for that.
[01:56:16.053 --> 01:56:18.114]  She was 100 yards, bullseye every time.
[01:56:18.874 --> 01:56:21.896]  And he ran around for like 30 minutes with a blunt
[01:56:22.716 --> 01:56:24.278]  It wasn't even a sharp pitchfork.
[01:56:24.378 --> 01:56:26.599]  Stabbing the toddler and stabbing the five-year-old.
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:31.583]  She tried to get into the safe, but under the law, she wasn't allowed to have the safe number.
[01:56:31.683 --> 01:56:33.264]  Under the law, it had to be locked up.
[01:56:33.684 --> 01:56:35.806]  And it was in a big safe, and she didn't know the code.
[01:56:36.406 --> 01:56:38.448]  And she was in an instant access pitchfork safe.
[01:56:38.488 --> 01:56:39.428]  I can get in there in three seconds.
[01:56:39.468 --> 01:56:41.690]  Well, she couldn't get in, and she had to leave.
[01:56:41.710 --> 01:56:43.451]  And I think he killed her three siblings.
[01:56:43.551 --> 01:56:43.792]  Right.
[01:56:44.012 --> 01:56:47.654]  And she went next door to a neighbor, I believe, and got help from the neighbor.
[01:56:47.854 --> 01:56:48.075]  Yes.
[01:56:48.795 --> 01:56:54.643]  But, again, the government tries to pass laws that are, you know, one size fits all.
[01:56:55.204 --> 01:56:59.570]  And as individuals, we all know that, you know, we don't all fit the same mold.
[01:57:00.484 --> 01:57:02.786]  Well, you've got to really be domesticated to be afraid of guns.
[01:57:03.046 --> 01:57:07.230]  I mean, that was the norm in this country, and now people are scared to death of them.
[01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:17.138]  Well, our country, the United States, started in 1775 when the King's police officers came to confiscate our guns at Lexington and Concord.
[01:57:17.158 --> 01:57:21.722]  And the Texas Revolution started it, and Gonzales over gun confiscation.
[01:57:21.742 --> 01:57:22.422]  Absolutely.
[01:57:22.583 --> 01:57:27.787]  The Mexican army tried to take our cannon, and we wrote up a quick flag that said, come and take it.
[01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.615]  And we kicked their behind.
[01:57:30.835 --> 01:57:31.875]  So, we'll be right back.
[01:57:31.915 --> 01:57:32.256]  We've got a break.
[01:57:32.276 --> 01:57:33.236]  We're short of the third hour.
[01:57:34.136 --> 01:57:38.038]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.378 --> 01:57:39.178]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:39.198 --> 01:57:39.719]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:40.779]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.819 --> 01:57:41.920]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:47.082]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.202 --> 01:57:49.643]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.414 --> 01:58:02.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.597 --> 01:58:06.679]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:29.076 --> 01:58:30.517]  Well, hello ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:30.537 --> 01:58:34.961]  We're back live, now in the third and final hour, and in a few minutes we're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:58:34.981 --> 01:58:41.966]  We're talking to a man who's running against the installed Republican, Michael McCaul, who's Republican in name only.
[01:58:41.986 --> 01:58:43.267]  I think they call those rhinos.
[01:58:43.307 --> 01:58:47.470]  He was Janet Reno's confidante, her attack dog, her minion who protected her on Chinagate.
[01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:52.251]  Waco, and just so many other horrible things.
[01:58:52.511 --> 01:59:03.694]  And Constitutional Scholar Michael Bagnerica is running against him in place 10, to be another Ron Paul for us, hailing from the great state of Texas.
[01:59:04.234 --> 01:59:08.695]  So he is here with us in studio now for another 20 minutes or so.
[01:59:08.715 --> 01:59:17.217]  I want to go to these calls, but Michael, any other points or issues you want to cover on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and where America is going right now?
[01:59:19.058 --> 01:59:22.260]  I just think that people need to read the Constitution and understand it.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.022]  I've written a book to make that all easier.
[01:59:25.082 --> 01:59:27.063]  The name of the book is Good to be King.
[01:59:27.723 --> 01:59:30.145]  You can get that at Amazon.com and other bookstores.
[01:59:30.585 --> 01:59:32.987]  It lays out things in very simple terms.
[01:59:33.047 --> 01:59:34.167]  To show how I'm out of the loop.
[01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:34.808]  I want that.
[01:59:34.828 --> 01:59:36.189]  Can I get a big discount and carry it?
[01:59:36.329 --> 01:59:36.849]  Absolutely.
[01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:38.610]  I mean, I've got a video on Bookstore right here.
[01:59:38.730 --> 01:59:39.270]  Absolutely.
[01:59:39.931 --> 01:59:40.471]  Get me a copy.
[01:59:40.511 --> 01:59:41.292]  I'm sure it's excellent.
[01:59:42.493 --> 01:59:43.634]  Tell us about Good to Be King.
[01:59:44.615 --> 01:59:46.436]  It starts out with just the basic premise.
[01:59:46.476 --> 01:59:47.517]  It starts out with Mel Brooks?
[01:59:47.677 --> 01:59:48.897]  No, no, no.
[01:59:49.017 --> 01:59:50.598]  I've never seen the tie.
[01:59:50.618 --> 01:59:52.019]  Well, I did see the Mel Brooks movie.
[01:59:52.099 --> 01:59:53.040]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:53.540]  I'm joking.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.141]  Go ahead.
[01:59:55.221 --> 01:59:58.183]  The idea is, why do we need any government at all?
[02:00:01.286 --> 02:00:07.794]  Did the Founding Fathers get together and say, you know, the birds are singing, the crops are good, and everything is... It was a limited government just to protect our property.
[02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:08.575]  Absolutely.
[02:00:09.055 --> 02:00:10.317]  So... From other governments.
[02:00:10.357 --> 02:00:13.741]  We go through, what, why this form of government?
[02:00:13.961 --> 02:00:18.086]  Why not communism, or socialism, or some other version?
[02:00:18.487 --> 02:00:20.349]  Why a constitutional republic?
[02:00:21.096 --> 02:00:27.241]  And so once we understand why they wrote the Constitution, then the Constitution is not quite so mystifying.
[02:00:27.281 --> 02:00:29.323]  It is not a living document.
[02:00:29.703 --> 02:00:32.365]  The only people who call it a living document are the people who are trying to sell it.
[02:00:32.385 --> 02:00:33.106]  Well, it's real simple.
[02:00:33.506 --> 02:00:36.369]  Bush gets up and says, I'm Commander-in-Chief so I can rob banks.
[02:00:36.389 --> 02:00:40.372]  He gets up and says, I can have martial law, I can spy on you, I'm Commander-in-Chief because they say I am.
[02:00:40.692 --> 02:00:49.735]  He's only commander-in-chief when they declare war with a specific enemy name and a specific conflict and then they still levy the money and control him during that executive process.
[02:00:49.755 --> 02:00:55.497]  The Legislative is supposed to be the strongest branch of government according to the stuff I've read, what the Founding Fathers wrote and debated.
[02:00:56.017 --> 02:00:57.698]  But then you go look at it, what, Article 2?
[02:00:57.998 --> 02:00:59.319]  Is it Section 2 of Article 2?
[02:00:59.599 --> 02:01:02.481]  Where it says the Commander-in-Chief has to follow the Constitution.
[02:01:02.741 --> 02:01:03.982]  It's not domestically.
[02:01:04.442 --> 02:01:06.823]  He can't violate any of the Bill of Rights.
[02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:11.326]  It's so limited, but the average person doesn't know what Article 2, Section 2 is.
[02:01:11.666 --> 02:01:24.954]  Well, when the President or anybody else, any other government agent, takes an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, they don't go to the National Archive, you know, once a month and stand in front of the document and make sure nobody gets a smudge mark on it.
[02:01:26.048 --> 02:01:28.471]  What they are defending is not the physical piece of paper.
[02:01:28.771 --> 02:01:31.414]  They are defending the ideals.
[02:01:31.494 --> 02:01:32.536]  Your private property.
[02:01:32.556 --> 02:01:35.639]  That's the purpose of taking that oath of office.
[02:01:35.859 --> 02:01:36.920]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:01:36.961 --> 02:01:37.781]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:01:37.862 --> 02:01:38.142]  Period.
[02:01:38.775 --> 02:01:44.639]  So, and as soon as more and more of our friends and fellow Americans wake up to that fact, I do.
[02:01:44.759 --> 02:01:46.000]  I am very optimistic.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.321]  I see things changing.
[02:01:48.481 --> 02:01:50.423]  People are starting to understand.
[02:01:51.683 --> 02:01:55.946]  And we're going to work very, very hard to win this election in District 10.
[02:01:56.427 --> 02:01:57.988]  Well, you know, I've been a pessimist.
[02:01:58.068 --> 02:01:59.368]  I've been doing this now for 12 years.
[02:01:59.669 --> 02:02:02.991]  I've been a pessimist in the past, the last four or five years, and now even more and more.
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.642]  I am really, it's always dark as before the dawn, for every action there's an equal or greater reaction.
[02:02:08.682 --> 02:02:10.143]  All those cliches play in here.
[02:02:11.103 --> 02:02:18.046]  I mean, literally my message, because it's genuine, it's backed up with fact, everything we cover every day is on the website.
[02:02:18.486 --> 02:02:20.527]  But still, I'm not even the best at delivering a message.
[02:02:21.907 --> 02:02:26.309]  I likened it to selling a life wrap to somebody who's in freezing waters.
[02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:29.651]  My usual analogy is snow cones in hell.
[02:02:30.131 --> 02:02:32.012]  I mean, people really are starting to get it.
[02:02:32.152 --> 02:02:32.652]  Yes, they are.
[02:02:33.292 --> 02:02:35.433]  And I'm very hopeful for that.
[02:02:35.653 --> 02:02:39.014]  I want to get your prediction of when we're going to really overturn this corrupt system.
[02:02:39.334 --> 02:02:40.815]  Or will it be more of a gradual thing?
[02:02:41.055 --> 02:02:42.636]  And we'll take your calls, I promise.
[02:02:42.696 --> 02:02:44.977]  On the other side, stay with us right here on GCN.
[02:02:47.253 --> 02:02:50.117]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.357 --> 02:02:51.939]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:56.966]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.306 --> 02:03:04.035]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.355 --> 02:03:06.337]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.537 --> 02:03:09.399]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.479 --> 02:03:14.143]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.343 --> 02:03:18.746]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:19.007 --> 02:03:26.232]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.628 --> 02:03:52.131]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:52.472 --> 02:03:56.555]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.855 --> 02:03:57.415]  We listened.
[02:03:57.715 --> 02:04:02.699]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.979 --> 02:04:03.460]  We listened.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.882]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:07.302 --> 02:04:07.843]  We listened.
[02:04:08.303 --> 02:04:12.364]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:12.744 --> 02:04:13.224]  We listened.
[02:04:13.564 --> 02:04:18.785]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:19.225 --> 02:04:20.585]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.945 --> 02:04:28.327]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:28.707 --> 02:04:32.168]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling

[02:04:37.631 --> 02:04:38.752]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.059 --> 02:04:53.140]  People continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:58.382]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:04:58.702 --> 02:05:06.603]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.763 --> 02:05:13.805]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:14.025 --> 02:05:15.246]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:15.386 --> 02:05:18.769]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:18.829 --> 02:05:19.950]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:21.512]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:21.712 --> 02:05:28.538]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:28.678 --> 02:05:31.120]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:05:34.321 --> 02:05:35.322]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:35.382 --> 02:05:36.623]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:36.663 --> 02:05:38.263]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.995 --> 02:05:58.638]  Michael Bagnerik, he was a presidential candidate for the Libertarians.
[02:05:58.878 --> 02:06:09.045]  One of their more fiery elections in 2004 was basically kidnapped in one of the debates just for even being near the sacred building trying to get in.
[02:06:10.025 --> 02:06:13.288]  And they are the only real big third party in this country.
[02:06:13.548 --> 02:06:16.270]  How many elected public servants
[02:06:17.655 --> 02:06:19.657]  Who are Libertarians are in high office right now?
[02:06:20.097 --> 02:06:23.181]  Well, we have 650 I think nationwide.
[02:06:23.661 --> 02:06:26.044]  I'm very excited about the 2006 election.
[02:06:26.164 --> 02:06:33.411]  It's an unofficial number, but I think we're going to have about 187 Libertarian candidates on the ballot in Texas.
[02:06:34.012 --> 02:06:35.113]  And it just keeps growing.
[02:06:35.133 --> 02:06:37.496]  I mean, you guys are, it's almost exponential.
[02:06:37.596 --> 02:06:38.136]  Yes, it is.
[02:06:38.337 --> 02:06:39.578]  And I'm very excited about that.
[02:06:40.535 --> 02:06:41.716]  Well, I'm excited about it, too.
[02:06:41.756 --> 02:06:43.257]  And, you know, libertarians are a diverse crowd.
[02:06:43.277 --> 02:06:47.621]  They run the gamut from what you could call liberal libertarians to very conservative libertarians.
[02:06:47.841 --> 02:06:48.902]  What would you call a Ron Paul?
[02:06:48.962 --> 02:06:51.304]  I'd call him kind of a conservative libertarian.
[02:06:52.641 --> 02:06:53.882]  I just call him a libertarian.
[02:06:54.002 --> 02:07:00.744]  I mean, he ran as a Republican, but he is a strict constitutional libertarian.
[02:07:01.525 --> 02:07:06.767]  He votes no on any legislation which violates the Constitution.
[02:07:06.867 --> 02:07:11.109]  And his nickname in Congress, as your listeners probably know, is Dr. No.
[02:07:13.144 --> 02:07:24.276]  I believe there were over 200 bills where 434 people voted in favor of it and one person, Ron Paul, voted against it.
[02:07:24.476 --> 02:07:27.579]  No, he really does do that because we don't need more laws.
[02:07:27.619 --> 02:07:29.321]  How many millions of laws are there?
[02:07:30.802 --> 02:07:35.447]  I mean, I could see 200 years ago saying ignorance of the law is no excuse because there was only a couple hundred laws.
[02:07:35.947 --> 02:07:37.289]  And it was pretty common sense stuff.
[02:07:37.329 --> 02:07:39.150]  Don't steal, don't rape, don't embezzle.
[02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:42.774]  Now, no one can follow all the laws.
[02:07:43.434 --> 02:07:45.957]  Quite frankly, when I ran, just for a few weeks for Congress,
[02:07:46.898 --> 02:07:50.319]  I don't know that it's impossible, but it is definitely difficult.
[02:07:50.339 --> 02:07:52.740]  And we have somebody on our campaign whose job it is to just read and understand the FEC rules.
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:14.362]  So, you know, we have one person dedicated to keeping us out of trouble.
[02:08:14.562 --> 02:08:18.545]  And up on infoawards.com is a link to the website, and he needs national support for this.
[02:08:18.965 --> 02:08:24.227]  Another congressman like Ron Paul, and McNair has got a good record, folks, so I think you should support him.
[02:08:24.548 --> 02:08:27.489]  Jason in Maryland, you're on the air with Michael McNair.
[02:08:27.529 --> 02:08:27.829]  Go ahead.
[02:08:27.849 --> 02:08:29.630]  Hello, Alex.
[02:08:29.730 --> 02:08:30.091]  Thanks.
[02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:31.571]  And hello, Michael.
[02:08:31.611 --> 02:08:37.514]  I was wondering if you could speak about the more serious charges, if you are aware of them.
[02:08:37.815 --> 02:08:38.435]  I'm sure you are.
[02:08:39.076 --> 02:08:48.434]  um... against this administration uh... specifically the charges of taking the country to war under false pretense and fabricated intel
[02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:53.529]  Yeah, it's part of the record that they fabricated the intelligence, that they premeditatedly lied.
[02:08:53.549 --> 02:08:54.650]  They've been caught red-handed.
[02:08:54.690 --> 02:08:55.570]  What's your take on that?
[02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:59.211]  Well, we haven't had a declared war since World War II.
[02:08:59.911 --> 02:09:02.192]  And there's a reason, because they've got to follow rules when they do that.
[02:09:02.212 --> 02:09:02.632]  That's right.
[02:09:02.852 --> 02:09:08.594]  So, Korea, Vietnam, all of these aggressions are outside the Constitution.
[02:09:08.614 --> 02:09:10.194]  They're police actions.
[02:09:10.254 --> 02:09:12.075]  We just watched the Rose Bowl last night.
[02:09:12.095 --> 02:09:18.617]  What do you think would have happened if the referee had given somebody a touchdown when their feet were outside, you know, the boundaries?
[02:09:18.937 --> 02:09:20.758]  I mean, there would have been a national riot.
[02:09:20.778 --> 02:09:21.919]  There would have been a riot.
[02:09:22.179 --> 02:09:25.261]  Because if you're going to play football, you've got to play by the rules.
[02:09:25.661 --> 02:09:29.323]  Well, if you're going to play international country, you have rules to live by.
[02:09:29.443 --> 02:09:30.784]  And that's called the U.S.
[02:09:30.824 --> 02:09:31.305]  Constitution.
[02:09:31.345 --> 02:09:34.507]  And the minute, I mean, if some banana republic doesn't follow a rule, that's one thing.
[02:09:34.527 --> 02:09:40.710]  The whole world is saying, we can preemptively attack people, we can torture, we can break the law, we can spy on people.
[02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:46.654]  Instead of being a beacon of light now, China's going, hey, we're going to have more Tiananmen Squares than they just did a month ago, because you're having them.
[02:09:47.054 --> 02:09:47.334]  Yeah.
[02:09:47.715 --> 02:09:54.640]  So, you know, what I want is I want our representatives in Washington to follow and understand the Constitution.
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:57.262]  Well, I understand all of that.
[02:09:57.282 --> 02:09:59.904]  Would you move for Lord Bush's impeachment if you were in Congress?
[02:10:00.384 --> 02:10:00.644]  Hello?
[02:10:01.165 --> 02:10:02.246]  Yes, Jason, we hear you.
[02:10:02.326 --> 02:10:08.791]  Yes, all of this is well said, but I'm speaking specifically about the charges filed by
[02:10:09.795 --> 02:10:16.991]  Prosecutor in Chicago about, you know, the foreknowledge and fabricated intel and the
[02:10:19.150 --> 02:10:21.070]  Not the whole 9-11, everything Alex is exposed.
[02:10:21.090 --> 02:10:22.031]  Sir, that's not true.
[02:10:22.091 --> 02:10:26.852]  People, that's disinfo that there's been all these indictments filed against Bush and people for that.
[02:10:26.892 --> 02:10:27.432]  It's not true.
[02:10:27.452 --> 02:10:28.792]  That's definitely not true.
[02:10:29.272 --> 02:10:30.113]  Yes, it's not true.
[02:10:30.493 --> 02:10:31.053]  Oh, okay.
[02:10:31.093 --> 02:10:31.453]  Thank you.
[02:10:31.853 --> 02:10:32.253]  You bet.
[02:10:32.473 --> 02:10:33.453]  I appreciate the call.
[02:10:33.553 --> 02:10:43.396]  I mean, I just, you know, we watch that, we watch those people make those claims, and now I'm just sure, and I was sure of it at the time when we said it, but I mean, it's just... No, Scooter Libby's been indicted.
[02:10:44.216 --> 02:10:45.996]  Scooter Libby has been indicted.
[02:10:46.797 --> 02:10:48.077]  No one else has been indicted.
[02:10:49.355 --> 02:10:52.637]  Well, other than like Abramoff, but that's a separate situation.
[02:10:52.697 --> 02:10:53.958]  He's pled guilty to conspiracy.
[02:10:54.398 --> 02:10:55.839]  Government's doing things wrong, Michael?
[02:10:59.884 --> 02:11:00.684]  I have to laugh.
[02:11:01.184 --> 02:11:06.426]  I mean, the whole idea of the government telling the truth is kind of a surprise anymore.
[02:11:07.106 --> 02:11:12.867]  Well, it gets attention when congressmen or women get up there and call for impeachment or call for people to get in trouble.
[02:11:12.927 --> 02:11:15.548]  I mean, what should our Iraq exit strategy be?
[02:11:15.588 --> 02:11:16.908]  What would your Iraq policy be?
[02:11:18.128 --> 02:11:22.209]  I would try to bring our soldiers home as safely and quickly as possible.
[02:11:22.869 --> 02:11:24.950]  We really shouldn't have been there in the first place.
[02:11:25.929 --> 02:11:30.551]  The longer we stay there, the higher our terrorism threat goes up.
[02:11:31.511 --> 02:11:36.673]  I would not make a plan to pull them out in one day, because that's physically impossible.
[02:11:37.574 --> 02:11:43.796]  If I were president, I would give my military commanders the instructions to... A controlled exit!
[02:11:43.836 --> 02:11:45.457]  We could be totally out of there in two months!
[02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.518]  You know, and let's do it.
[02:11:47.538 --> 02:11:51.960]  We've got to get out, we've got to stop tampering with the Middle East.
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:55.402]  Well, let's face it, they're building six giant permanent bases.
[02:11:56.084 --> 02:11:58.565]  The size of small cities, and then nobody's leaving.
[02:11:58.586 --> 02:11:59.626]  We'll be there in 50 years.
[02:11:59.646 --> 02:11:59.886]  Right.
[02:11:59.906 --> 02:12:01.787]  I mean, Cheney said 20 years.
[02:12:02.228 --> 02:12:07.731]  Well, World War II has been over with for over 50 years, and we don't have an exit strategy for Germany or Japan.
[02:12:07.831 --> 02:12:09.292]  Notice how they keep lying, too.
[02:12:09.332 --> 02:12:12.073]  They just keep going, well, it'll be another year, it'll be another year.
[02:12:12.093 --> 02:12:13.874]  They told the troops, you'll be home by Christmas.
[02:12:14.094 --> 02:12:15.295]  The road to home is Baghdad.
[02:12:15.535 --> 02:12:18.317]  By the way, in World War II, they'd only make you do one tour 11 months.
[02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:19.938]  Vietnam, 11 months.
[02:12:19.958 --> 02:12:20.878]  They knew you'd break down.
[02:12:20.938 --> 02:12:21.839]  Napoleon knew that.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:24.661]  Hitler knew that, and that's why he finally failed.
[02:12:24.681 --> 02:12:26.363]  He tried to make his soldiers do three tours.
[02:12:26.903 --> 02:12:32.448]  Some are starting their fourth tour, because some were there a year before the invasion, and that's very stressful.
[02:12:32.469 --> 02:12:41.577]  But we've got three tours coming up, three 11s, almost three years coming up here very soon, and now there's debate.
[02:12:41.597 --> 02:12:44.820]  Well, the soldiers are wimps having post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:49.813]  I mean, this is serious low-intensity conflict, raiding houses every day.
[02:12:49.873 --> 02:12:53.395]  I mean, imagine if the SWAT team had to do ten raids a day for three years.
[02:12:53.875 --> 02:12:57.377]  I mean, the SWAT team can't do two raids a week without having post-traumatic stress.
[02:12:58.758 --> 02:13:00.959]  No one has ever flushed our troops down the toilet like this.
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:08.744]  I feel so strongly for our troops, and we need to bring them home so they can be with their families for the holidays and stuff.
[02:13:09.144 --> 02:13:09.745]  I agree.
[02:13:09.845 --> 02:13:10.745]  Stewart in Texas.
[02:13:10.765 --> 02:13:11.426]  Stewart, go ahead.
[02:13:11.906 --> 02:13:12.106]  Great.
[02:13:12.146 --> 02:13:13.748]  Three quick comments and I'll hang up.
[02:13:14.728 --> 02:13:17.971]  Michael, you mentioned ending the IRS, but that's not the answer.
[02:13:18.011 --> 02:13:21.494]  They're just going to bring in something more controlling and worse.
[02:13:21.514 --> 02:13:23.756]  Yeah, a dual sales tax along with it will be just as bad.
[02:13:24.436 --> 02:13:24.997]  I agree.
[02:13:25.077 --> 02:13:28.740]  It was just an example of what you could do with the money if the government wasn't taking it.
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:29.761]  Okay.
[02:13:29.921 --> 02:13:36.766]  And the McCall family, I've met these individuals and well, their family owns the voting machines.
[02:13:37.647 --> 02:13:39.829]  And as a frustrated libertarian,
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:45.322]  I don't know if you need to get together with the Democrats that are running and kind of point that out.
[02:13:45.342 --> 02:13:46.323]  Yeah, they're part of it, see?
[02:13:46.343 --> 02:13:47.564]  They want to keep all that quiet.
[02:13:47.824 --> 02:13:52.646]  Okay, last thing is... Because in some areas, they control those little special machines.
[02:13:53.127 --> 02:13:54.247]  Right, and I guess that's true.
[02:13:54.427 --> 02:13:56.228]  By the way, folks, that's really true.
[02:13:56.288 --> 02:13:57.809]  His family really does own the machines.
[02:13:58.509 --> 02:14:01.571]  That, what, 90% of his votes will be... But you know what?
[02:14:01.931 --> 02:14:04.873]  If somebody wins by such great numbers, they still can't even pull a monkey.
[02:14:07.567 --> 02:14:13.431]  Okay, and I've taken your Constitution class.
[02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:14.891]  I've got your book.
[02:14:14.991 --> 02:14:16.292]  It's great.
[02:14:16.392 --> 02:14:18.493]  I recommend it for everybody listening.
[02:14:18.634 --> 02:14:20.134]  It's just terrific stuff.
[02:14:20.194 --> 02:14:25.377]  My frustration with the Libertarians is they won't speak out on the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:14:25.397 --> 02:14:30.040]  They won't speak out on the 9-11 cover-up and the inside job going on there.
[02:14:31.101 --> 02:14:34.803]  We keep just running around the same stuff and it's all good, but we're not
[02:14:35.339 --> 02:14:40.025]  Americans are shallow people for the most part when it comes to the Constitution.
[02:14:42.267 --> 02:14:44.530]  Are you going to speak out on 9-11 in Oklahoma?
[02:14:44.590 --> 02:14:46.572]  I think I'll put it this way, and thanks for the call, Stuart.
[02:14:46.592 --> 02:14:47.213]  I'll put it this way.
[02:14:47.293 --> 02:14:53.460]  We had the CIA commander of the Afghanistan operations on yesterday.
[02:14:54.625 --> 02:14:59.671]  And, you know, the headline on MSNBC is, CIA Commander Was Blocked From Capturing Bin Laden.
[02:15:00.092 --> 02:15:05.538]  And he admitted that our government, in the 1950s, carried out terror attacks to blame it on Mosaddegh and take over Iran.
[02:15:06.139 --> 02:15:07.841]  So, the Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[02:15:07.861 --> 02:15:08.922]  That's now declassified 100%.
[02:15:10.231 --> 02:15:12.493]  I mean, people may have known 30 years ago, but now it's public.
[02:15:13.073 --> 02:15:14.054]  All of that's out there.
[02:15:14.114 --> 02:15:16.976]  Will you ever discuss those issues or talk about those issues?
[02:15:17.016 --> 02:15:21.319]  Because Ray McGovern will come on, Chief CIA Advisor to Ronald Reagan and say it.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.762]  The former CIA head will come out and say stuff like this now.
[02:15:26.483 --> 02:15:27.984]  NSA people are going public.
[02:15:28.064 --> 02:15:29.305]  So many prominent people.
[02:15:30.285 --> 02:15:35.108]  Paul Craig Roberts, who was number two at Treasury, the chief economist for Bush.
[02:15:35.909 --> 02:15:42.132]  This current Bush, in his last administration, has been on Morgan Reynolds and talked about 9-11 clearly being an inside job.
[02:15:42.773 --> 02:15:49.116]  I mean, obviously, you talk about that here on air, they can use that against you on TV, but any signal to the people out there?
[02:15:49.136 --> 02:15:57.141]  I'm going to be going and talking with the people, shaking hands with them and letting them know that when I give you an answer, it is not political rhetoric.
[02:15:57.765 --> 02:15:59.626]  I want to go to Washington D.C.
[02:15:59.686 --> 02:16:03.828]  and represent not only the people in District 10, but the people in the United States.
[02:16:03.848 --> 02:16:07.110]  But let's say the Defense Department sets off a nuke tomorrow and starts arresting everybody.
[02:16:07.190 --> 02:16:09.611]  Do you realize how close we are?
[02:16:09.892 --> 02:16:10.912]  Michael, this is not a joke.
[02:16:11.412 --> 02:16:15.375]  I do understand that things are critical, but I'm also very optimistic.
[02:16:15.435 --> 02:16:19.877]  People are understanding that the government is not following the Constitution.
[02:16:19.917 --> 02:16:22.098]  They are abusing their authority.
[02:16:22.919 --> 02:16:27.101]  So you're saying they've lost so much trust now that you think they're losing even more control?
[02:16:28.298 --> 02:16:41.065]  I think that the people, specifically, you know, across the United States, but hopefully in District 10, have lost confidence in the government, and that they are at the point where they are willing to vote for someone other than a Democrat or Republican.
[02:16:41.565 --> 02:16:46.587]  I don't think that they're going to feel like they are wasting their vote when they cast a ballot for me.
[02:16:46.607 --> 02:16:51.650]  But the question is, let's say you go to a meeting here in Austin, and I know half the people bring up 9-11 inside a job to you.
[02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:57.633]  If people bring that up, are you going to say, my constituents are concerned about the cover-up of 9-11 and want a real investigation?
[02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:02.171]  If my constituents tell me that they're concerned about that, yes, I'll bring it up.
[02:17:02.211 --> 02:17:07.053]  Maybe you could start a committee up there and call the people in.
[02:17:07.113 --> 02:17:09.894]  It could be, have you ever or are you ever involved in 9-11?
[02:17:09.974 --> 02:17:10.234]  Yeah.
[02:17:11.534 --> 02:17:16.516]  What I'm really trying to do is just get the base support from, you know... I understand.
[02:17:16.536 --> 02:17:17.497]  You're trying to get step one.
[02:17:17.537 --> 02:17:18.257]  You're trying to win.
[02:17:18.457 --> 02:17:18.637]  Right.
[02:17:19.392 --> 02:17:20.413]  I mean, look, it's like Ron Paul.
[02:17:20.433 --> 02:17:33.483]  I've got him here on the show, and he'll say everything up to that point, and he won't say that, because they've already had TV ads with his head floating around Jupiter saying, he's from outer space, he's a... Just wink at me, and you'll know it's true.
[02:17:34.084 --> 02:17:34.984]  Oh, we got him!
[02:17:35.385 --> 02:17:37.306]  All right.
[02:17:37.566 --> 02:17:38.967]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:17:39.608 --> 02:17:41.609]  Listen, do one more five-minute segment with me.
[02:17:41.649 --> 02:17:44.252]  I know you've got to go, but one more, because I've got a few more calls here for you.
[02:17:44.272 --> 02:17:44.592]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.287 --> 02:17:51.653]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[02:17:52.114 --> 02:17:58.583]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[02:17:59.062 --> 02:18:01.223]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[02:18:01.623 --> 02:18:07.644]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[02:18:08.205 --> 02:18:27.530]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[02:18:38.095 --> 02:18:38.295]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:18:38.375 --> 02:18:39.096]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:39.296 --> 02:18:39.996]  One and the same.
[02:18:56.047 --> 02:19:00.028]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:00.048 --> 02:19:02.109]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:02.129 --> 02:19:02.629]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:02.669 --> 02:19:04.170]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:04.450 --> 02:19:04.930]  Here is reality.
[02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:07.371]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:07.411 --> 02:19:10.232]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:26.027 --> 02:19:29.768]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:30.208 --> 02:19:33.929]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[02:20:35.183 --> 02:20:36.624]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:20:36.684 --> 02:20:38.306]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:20:38.326 --> 02:20:39.487]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:20:39.507 --> 02:20:39.567]  Yes.
[02:20:39.587 --> 02:20:39.927]  You neglect me.
[02:20:40.107 --> 02:20:41.308]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:20:41.328 --> 02:20:42.149]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:20:42.229 --> 02:20:43.070]  I'm getting sick.
[02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:46.212]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:21:02.226 --> 02:21:02.707]  Wait a minute.
[02:21:02.807 --> 02:21:04.429]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:21:04.649 --> 02:21:13.239]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:21:13.679 --> 02:21:19.166]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:21:19.386 --> 02:21:21.769]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:21:21.929 --> 02:21:26.590]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:28.471]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:21:28.651 --> 02:21:31.971]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[02:21:58.624 --> 02:22:04.771]  Alright, I'm going to get into building 7 and I'm going to the new developments there, big developments, and a bunch of other news.
[02:22:04.791 --> 02:22:06.773]  In the last 30 minutes, we won't even take calls.
[02:22:06.853 --> 02:22:10.517]  Well, I might take a few that have been holding, but there's a lot coming up.
[02:22:10.537 --> 02:22:12.679]  But we've kept Michael Bagnerik for one more segment.
[02:22:12.939 --> 02:22:13.981]  We really appreciate him.
[02:22:14.021 --> 02:22:15.963]  And I've been cornering him during the breaks.
[02:22:16.647 --> 02:22:19.791]  I'm just talking to his campaign manager saying, I'm telling you, toll roads.
[02:22:19.871 --> 02:22:22.335]  And obviously he's against them, you heard that in the last hour.
[02:22:22.375 --> 02:22:24.818]  But toll roads, toll roads, toll roads.
[02:22:24.878 --> 02:22:30.466]  And the campaign manager was telling me about our good friend Jimmy Vaughn, who's a great friend of the show and a great American who's been fighting it.
[02:22:30.846 --> 02:22:32.889]  You know, the toll roads are even going to take part of his ranch.
[02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:38.085]  And you know, he was telling me how Jimmy was giving him this hour-long tour of Corridor Watch and Stahl's campaign.
[02:22:38.545 --> 02:22:40.506]  I think you guys need to link up, man.
[02:22:40.786 --> 02:22:47.668]  I mean, I understand you're for the whole Constitution, but I think, I mean, you talk about contributions, support, my two cents.
[02:22:47.728 --> 02:22:52.630]  And I know you're saying you're going to do whatever your constituents are telling you they're most concerned about constitutionally.
[02:22:53.010 --> 02:22:55.971]  I mean, are you getting the feedback that the toll roads of the zeitgeist?
[02:22:56.051 --> 02:22:57.351]  We haven't gotten that feedback yet.
[02:22:57.551 --> 02:23:00.594]  We're going to be starting our... You're just starting, you're rolling, you're just rolling.
[02:23:00.614 --> 02:23:02.115]  Yeah, we've been building the infrastructure.
[02:23:02.135 --> 02:23:05.198]  We've got office space, we've got staff members, we've got bumper stickers.
[02:23:05.458 --> 02:23:07.080]  I know how it is, you've got to build the infrastructure.
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:08.621]  We've got the infrastructure built.
[02:23:08.941 --> 02:23:14.366]  I couldn't wait to come back from Christmas break to really get into the campaign.
[02:23:14.386 --> 02:23:15.487]  And now we've got 10 months.
[02:23:15.688 --> 02:23:17.970]  We've got, well, just, yeah, 10 months.
[02:23:18.090 --> 02:23:19.411]  We've been working really hard.
[02:23:19.831 --> 02:23:24.273]  My staff works about 10 to 12 hours a day, and this is early in the campaign.
[02:23:24.293 --> 02:23:27.814]  Well, just up front, I'm lobbying you, and you're going to get used to this when you're in Washington.
[02:23:27.834 --> 02:23:28.614]  I'm grabbing your hand.
[02:23:28.634 --> 02:23:29.254]  Give me your hand.
[02:23:29.274 --> 02:23:29.855]  Give me your hand.
[02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:32.435]  Now, Congressman, I just really need this done.
[02:23:32.535 --> 02:23:34.216]  Listen, I don't want those toll roads.
[02:23:34.276 --> 02:23:35.837]  I want the King of Spain kicked out of here.
[02:23:35.857 --> 02:23:37.057]  I want him kicked out of here.
[02:23:37.077 --> 02:23:38.237]  Alright, alright, that's good.
[02:23:38.578 --> 02:23:40.818]  Here, let me take a few calls here.
[02:23:40.838 --> 02:23:43.939]  Now, out of all these callers, who's up next for our guest?
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.161]  Tim in Florida, you're on the air, and then Andy.
[02:23:47.381 --> 02:23:48.361]  Go ahead, Tim, quickly, sir.
[02:23:49.205 --> 02:23:50.185]  Hey, great show, Alex.
[02:23:50.565 --> 02:23:54.086]  Mike, I want to ask you, are you an attorney?
[02:23:54.886 --> 02:23:55.767]  I am not an attorney.
[02:23:56.247 --> 02:23:57.307]  You've never been an attorney?
[02:23:57.627 --> 02:23:59.487]  I have no desire to be an attorney.
[02:24:00.008 --> 02:24:00.688]  Excellent, okay.
[02:24:00.988 --> 02:24:02.328]  Are you a member of the Square?
[02:24:02.348 --> 02:24:04.769]  He wants to know if you're a Mason.
[02:24:05.969 --> 02:24:08.730]  Oh, I didn't even know what he was talking about.
[02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:10.030]  No, I'm not a member of the...
[02:24:11.431 --> 02:24:13.832]  Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
[02:24:13.852 --> 02:24:13.892]  No.
[02:24:15.033 --> 02:24:16.933]  Have you ever been visited by aliens?
[02:24:16.953 --> 02:24:27.157]  Tooth fairies, leprechauns... I've been a Boy Scout, a Scoutmaster, an Advanced First Aid Instructor for the Red Cross, but I've never joined any meetings.
[02:24:27.177 --> 02:24:29.358]  Hey, seriously, anything else, Tim?
[02:24:29.958 --> 02:24:30.938]  That's all I wanted to know.
[02:24:31.658 --> 02:24:32.499]  Well, I hope you'll support him.
[02:24:32.519 --> 02:24:33.119]  Are you going to support him?
[02:24:34.105 --> 02:24:35.846]  I don't vote because I'm not in the system.
[02:24:53.281 --> 02:24:54.021]  Is the way to go.
[02:24:54.081 --> 02:24:58.222]  It's like Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[02:24:58.242 --> 02:25:00.003]  Alright, let's go ahead, and that's me.
[02:25:00.283 --> 02:25:02.743]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Washington.
[02:25:02.803 --> 02:25:04.404]  Andy, last caller for our guest, go ahead.
[02:25:04.884 --> 02:25:14.146]  Hi Alex, you justly comment on the abuses of the police in this country, and I've been wanting to bring this up for you for a while, but it seems like a perfect time today considering your guest's constitutional background.
[02:25:15.026 --> 02:25:21.188]  I'm from Washington State and wanted to make a quick comment on the constitutionally protected right to bear arms.
[02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:37.053]  In my state constitution article 1, which is our declaration of rights part, section 24, it briefly states, the right to bear arms, the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be construed
[02:25:38.184 --> 02:25:52.601]  Yeah, that's because you're a territory, so you're one of the few states that doesn't have it, but under the federal law you do, and under organic law you do, and so, you know, you've got maximum rights.
[02:25:53.161 --> 02:25:57.544]  Well, and the point that I'm bringing up here, all police in this state work for corporations.
[02:25:57.564 --> 02:25:58.685]  Cities are incorporated.
[02:25:58.765 --> 02:26:03.729]  No, I know, their very law trying to restrict you from having a second amendment actually restricts them.
[02:26:04.069 --> 02:26:04.990]  Michael, you want to comment on that?
[02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:05.710]  I agree.
[02:26:06.351 --> 02:26:13.136]  During the presidential campaign, I was in Missouri, and someone wanted me to confirm or deny that the Missouri Constitution
[02:26:14.533 --> 02:26:17.375]  allowed or didn't allow concealed carry weapons.
[02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:26.839]  I said, I don't know what the Missouri Constitution says, but if it tries to limit your right, then the Missouri Constitution is a violation of your rights and is unconstitutional.
[02:26:27.119 --> 02:26:30.660]  Yeah, see, they can't even change the Constitution and then declare that we don't have rights.
[02:26:30.761 --> 02:26:35.803]  In Article 9, in 10, it just keeps restating, no, it comes from you.
[02:26:36.123 --> 02:26:37.964]  We're just codifying it.
[02:26:38.064 --> 02:26:38.304]  Right.
[02:26:38.744 --> 02:26:43.047]  We can alter or abolish any government which is in violation of our rights.
[02:26:43.127 --> 02:26:47.370]  So, you know... I mean, let's say Adolf Hitler beat America and took over.
[02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:51.733]  I would, you know, I'm sure our forefathers would have been fighting him from the fence rows.
[02:26:52.193 --> 02:26:57.436]  Just because it's government, you don't have to kneel down and go, oh, oh, oh, and start worshipping it.
[02:26:57.717 --> 02:26:58.057]  That's right.
[02:26:59.138 --> 02:27:02.201]  We need to use your individual thoughts and processes.
[02:27:02.261 --> 02:27:04.863]  Understand that every individual has rights.
[02:27:05.263 --> 02:27:07.966]  You need to respect other people's rights and then defend your own.
[02:27:08.226 --> 02:27:11.749]  And you need to get that... You're absolutely right about these cities.
[02:27:12.129 --> 02:27:18.094]  You have these incorporated cities that aren't even really lawful now trying to absorb the counties that are supreme.
[02:27:18.932 --> 02:27:19.132]  Yes.
[02:27:19.192 --> 02:27:19.733]  And the Sheriff.
[02:27:20.333 --> 02:27:23.876]  Michael, we've got to get you back in here before the campaign ends in ten months.
[02:27:24.016 --> 02:27:26.137]  We'll be watching it, so will the rest of the country.
[02:27:26.157 --> 02:27:26.798]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:27:26.838 --> 02:27:27.558]  Thank you so much, Al.
[02:27:27.779 --> 02:27:28.079]  You bet.
[02:27:28.099 --> 02:27:33.303]  Michael Bagnerik, now running for Congress against Demon McCall in place ten, deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:27:33.323 --> 02:27:33.903]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.585 --> 02:27:37.486]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.986 --> 02:27:39.587]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.607 --> 02:27:43.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:41.278 --> 02:30:55.088]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.108 --> 02:30:58.651]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:05.629 --> 02:31:25.974]  Well, it was great having Michael Bagnerik here in studio with us, and I want to go to a couple of callers that have been holding who did not specifically want to talk to Michael Bagnerik, Joe in Wisconsin, and a few others, but I really need to spend some time right now getting into some of the good things
[02:31:27.069 --> 02:31:37.576]  that are happening and right now in New Hampshire a bill has been introduced that aims to prevent Katrina-style gun seizures.
[02:31:37.616 --> 02:31:41.619]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:31:42.159 --> 02:31:53.867]  Concerned by perceived abuses of federal power during the Katrina crisis, New Hampshire state reps are reviewing a bill which would criminalize certain weapon seizures even if the perpetrators
[02:31:54.773 --> 02:32:02.096]  Our federal officers, House Bill 1639FN, this is such good news, criminalizing your criminal behavior.
[02:32:02.116 --> 02:32:04.596]  It's already criminal, but let's just restate that.
[02:32:05.137 --> 02:32:18.241]  Prohibits the classification of lawfully owned and lawfully carried firearms during a state of emergency, making a felon of any law enforcement officer, peace officer, public servant, who attempts to seize any firearm during a disaster.
[02:32:19.742 --> 02:32:23.383]  The bill was sponsored by Representative Paul Hopvergraten,
[02:32:24.295 --> 02:32:37.104]  At the request of local free staters, members of the group trying to recruit freedom lovers in New Hampshire and turn it into an even more libertarian state than it already is at freestateproject.org.
[02:32:37.144 --> 02:32:46.490]  The bill reads, any law enforcement officer, a person acting as a law enforcement officer, or other public official, how about public servant, get it straight,
[02:32:47.256 --> 02:33:01.960]  You're such free staters, you should know that, who confiscates or attempts to confiscate lawfully carried or lawfully owned firearms in the state during a declared state of emergency shall be charged with a class A felony.
[02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:05.321]  And I gotta tell you, I totally agree with that.
[02:33:05.741 --> 02:33:11.203]  I mean, if you're engaged in mass gun confiscation operations, then you should go to jail.
[02:33:11.283 --> 02:33:11.683]  It's simple.
[02:33:12.242 --> 02:33:13.823]  Well, we need to protect ourselves.
[02:33:13.943 --> 02:33:15.984]  It's so dangerous going in and taking guns.
[02:33:16.244 --> 02:33:22.087]  It's so dangerous not bringing food and water to people, and instead refusing to do that and tromping around trying to get their guns.
[02:33:22.307 --> 02:33:26.289]  And that's why FEMA botched the whole thing on purpose and jammed communications and did that.
[02:33:26.890 --> 02:33:38.295]  And the chaos following Hurricane Katrina's various government agencies, including federal marshals, made systematic attempts to sweep New Orleans of guns, even if that meant entering the homes of law-abiding gun owners.
[02:33:38.355 --> 02:33:41.137]  Well, high and dry areas in the suburbs and million-dollar houses.
[02:33:41.821 --> 02:33:44.729]  The move did not cause widespread outage in most states.
[02:33:46.534 --> 02:33:54.121]  uh... outrage in most states, excuse me, but New Hampshire residents reacted by burning a FEMA flag in front of a local federal building.
[02:33:54.421 --> 02:34:00.746]  They also circulated a petition pledging resistance if such a move were ever attempted in the live free or die state.
[02:34:01.267 --> 02:34:04.149]  How about live like a slave or grovel on your knees state?
[02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:13.998]  I mean, you know, America's now land of the dumb and home of the slaves, a place where guns are part of the culture and gun laws are the second loosest in the nation next to Vermont.
[02:34:14.678 --> 02:34:26.970]  Activists say whether it passes or not, the gun protection bill is one more small thing they can do to try to protect themselves from the disarmament at the hands of the government during a time when they believe they will need their weapons most.
[02:34:27.390 --> 02:34:37.360]  Yeah, if there's a nuke goes off or bio-attack... I remember talking to a Louisiana state trooper about three years ago off-air.
[02:34:38.208 --> 02:34:39.449]  And he sent me some information.
[02:34:39.529 --> 02:34:43.432]  He said they were being told by FEMA, we're going to be hit by a bow attack.
[02:34:43.592 --> 02:34:44.813]  This is exactly how it went.
[02:34:44.833 --> 02:34:47.995]  And when I talked about it on air, people called in and said, oh yeah, my brother's a cop.
[02:34:48.015 --> 02:34:48.675]  He said the same thing.
[02:34:49.296 --> 02:34:52.418]  And when there's an attack, we've got to confiscate the guns.
[02:34:52.518 --> 02:34:58.242]  During a breakdown of society, there's going to be rioting and we can't have people owning guns.
[02:34:58.362 --> 02:35:06.148]  No, you want the police to team up with the law-abiding citizens and deal with always the small minority that is running around looting.
[02:35:06.733 --> 02:35:08.115]  That's what we always did in the past.
[02:35:08.175 --> 02:35:10.497]  It's even what Switzerland does and what England used to do.
[02:35:10.537 --> 02:35:14.482]  But see, now governments are criminal, so they team up with the other crooks.
[02:35:14.542 --> 02:35:16.584]  It's the same kind of mindset and saying, no, no, no.
[02:35:16.905 --> 02:35:18.186]  We're not going to bring you food.
[02:35:18.727 --> 02:35:19.848]  We're not going to bring you water.
[02:35:20.228 --> 02:35:23.752]  We're going to block all that and we're going to have a big war game here and come take your guns.
[02:35:24.913 --> 02:35:26.936]  So it is just amazing.
[02:35:28.457 --> 02:35:31.318]  Now, let's get into Larry Silverstein now.
[02:35:31.398 --> 02:35:32.138]  Well, you know what?
[02:35:32.158 --> 02:35:37.999]  Did you cue that up where, on ABC News, the troops are confiscating the citizens' guns?
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:39.240]  Oh, you have that?
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:39.400]  Yeah.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:42.480]  Let's just, because I normally don't play clips ten times.
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:49.042]  It's probably my fifth time, but this one's so important, I want you to hear it one more time.
[02:35:49.082 --> 02:35:49.842]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:35:51.062 --> 02:35:57.644]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion, sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[02:35:58.982 --> 02:36:01.324]  Instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[02:36:02.405 --> 02:36:04.027]  We say guns will be taken.
[02:36:04.067 --> 02:36:05.308]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:36:05.569 --> 02:36:06.550]  We will take all the weapons.
[02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:12.215]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[02:36:14.137 --> 02:36:15.979]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[02:36:16.459 --> 02:36:19.603]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[02:36:20.103 --> 02:36:22.906]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[02:36:24.648 --> 02:36:29.389]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:34.070]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:34.370]  Okay.
[02:36:34.471 --> 02:36:36.591]  They had to leave a note because they couldn't... That's enough.
[02:36:36.611 --> 02:36:40.312]  Yeah, like it feels uncomfortable when you're robbing a bank, I'm sure.
[02:36:40.352 --> 02:36:48.074]  It probably feels uncomfortable the first time you're a serial killer and you go pick up some poor woman who's a hitchhiker and go chop her head off after you rape her.
[02:36:48.712 --> 02:36:51.573]  I'm sure it feels uncomfortable the first time you smoke crack cocaine.
[02:36:51.613 --> 02:36:55.073]  I bet it feels uncomfortable when you're drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels every day.
[02:36:55.113 --> 02:36:58.674]  It probably feels uncomfortable if you punch your wife in the face and knock her teeth out.
[02:36:58.894 --> 02:37:00.294]  Because you're not supposed to be doing it!
[02:37:00.454 --> 02:37:01.195]  That's why!
[02:37:01.215 --> 02:37:03.835]  I mean, you people are unbelievable!
[02:37:04.155 --> 02:37:05.475]  You disgrace your forefathers.
[02:37:05.495 --> 02:37:06.736]  You disgrace this country.
[02:37:07.016 --> 02:37:08.316]  You're the lowest form of filth!
[02:37:10.416 --> 02:37:11.197]  But that's okay.
[02:37:11.217 --> 02:37:13.057]  Our new freedom is to go watch the Rose Bowl.
[02:37:14.088 --> 02:37:16.430]  Understand, folks, I've been to the training drills.
[02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:17.790]  I've been talking about this forever.
[02:37:17.810 --> 02:37:18.731]  It's why I get so mad.
[02:37:20.032 --> 02:37:21.613]  They've been waiting for an excuse.
[02:37:21.653 --> 02:37:23.034]  That was a beta test.
[02:37:23.094 --> 02:37:26.636]  The military has trained to take your guns.
[02:37:26.656 --> 02:37:27.697]  Who do you understand?
[02:37:27.737 --> 02:37:29.098]  They want to do it.
[02:37:30.058 --> 02:37:30.959]  It could be tomorrow.
[02:37:31.339 --> 02:37:32.500]  It could be two years from now.
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:33.761]  It could be a decade from now.
[02:37:33.781 --> 02:37:37.163]  A nuke goes off and it's over, folks.
[02:37:37.243 --> 02:37:39.304]  And people will be going, well, why aren't they helping us?
[02:37:39.364 --> 02:37:40.645]  The economy's breaking down.
[02:37:40.685 --> 02:37:43.107]  Why are there just troops demanding if we want food,
[02:37:43.954 --> 02:37:45.616]  That we've got to bring our guns out to them.
[02:37:46.036 --> 02:37:48.318]  Folks, listen to my shows from 10 years ago.
[02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:50.921]  Listen to the other intelligence officers we interviewed 10 years ago.
[02:37:51.381 --> 02:37:52.742]  They were in the briefings.
[02:37:52.782 --> 02:37:53.964]  That's why they went public.
[02:37:54.004 --> 02:37:55.145]  That was always the plan.
[02:37:55.805 --> 02:38:01.691]  When there's a disaster, the government's going to do everything it can, and the compartmentalized people in it aren't going to ask why they're doing it.
[02:38:02.331 --> 02:38:14.419]  But we have the documents to make it worse, to have a breakdown so you don't have food and water, so you've got to be then processed, quote, through the relocation centers and can have your guns taken and be relocated.
[02:38:14.899 --> 02:38:18.021]  Out of this crisis, they re-engineer America.
[02:38:18.341 --> 02:38:20.322]  They re-engineer the world.
[02:38:21.763 --> 02:38:24.264]  This is what they're doing.
[02:38:24.745 --> 02:38:28.267]  This is really happening right now.
[02:38:29.736 --> 02:38:32.638]  I cannot believe some people don't understand this.
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:36.101]  Who's up first here in the calls?
[02:38:36.121 --> 02:38:37.162]  I'll just take a few of them.
[02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:39.923]  Joe in Wisconsin, thanks for holding.
[02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:40.344]  Go ahead.
[02:38:40.364 --> 02:38:41.304]  Hi Alex.
[02:38:41.725 --> 02:38:43.586]  I think you were looking for U.S.
[02:38:43.746 --> 02:38:49.410]  Code 50 when you were saying that the President has to follow certain procedures when he's going to war.
[02:38:50.014 --> 02:38:56.097]  I mean, if you read through that... Well, they have a code attached to the Constitution, but I don't even go off the code.
[02:38:56.137 --> 02:38:56.938]  I go off the Constitution.
[02:38:57.518 --> 02:38:57.738]  Okay.
[02:38:58.158 --> 02:39:02.641]  But anyway, I wanted to discuss how China got the most favored nation status.
[02:39:03.021 --> 02:39:06.443]  That was under Carter, and that was 1980.
[02:39:07.243 --> 02:39:13.487]  What I was wondering is, how in the world they could have gotten that if they knew about the human rights violations back then?
[02:39:14.487 --> 02:39:17.149]  And are they setting us up for the same treatment?
[02:39:17.854 --> 02:39:22.297]  If we're not supposed to care about what goes on over there, maybe we shouldn't care about what's going on over here.
[02:39:22.577 --> 02:39:25.259]  Well, I think your point is absolutely central.
[02:39:25.299 --> 02:39:34.445]  If we have a government that, through the United Nations, gives China awards and says, you are the model, you are the best.
[02:39:34.726 --> 02:39:41.470]  If you watch the CFR meetings on C-SPAN or read their bi-monthly publications, they worship, they lavish, they fawn
[02:39:45.178 --> 02:40:06.056]  All over China, in mobile execution vans, melting down dead prisoners for collagen, killing hundreds of innocent farmers who don't want to go up their land, police in black riot gear, same black Darth Vader outfits our police have, mowing them down with machine guns, all of our industry moving over there, our global corporations saying they're the future.
[02:40:06.536 --> 02:40:11.160]  Yes, sir, they're going to use the slaves of China to leverage out the whole world.
[02:40:12.173 --> 02:40:15.996]  Well, even Mexico's losing most of its jobs now because of China.
[02:40:16.657 --> 02:40:21.141]  And now India's coming online with major industrialization at slave level.
[02:40:21.661 --> 02:40:24.804]  I mean, literally, they don't even have cardboard boxes to live in in most Indian cities.
[02:40:24.824 --> 02:40:27.806]  They just use the bathroom on the street and wander around.
[02:40:28.026 --> 02:40:36.674]  And then the next cast up from that, it works for subsistence level, you know, answering the phones, building the widgets.
[02:40:37.214 --> 02:40:44.863]  I mean, it is a hellish system, and so if we have any questions, in the past our government would at least pay a little lip service criticizing China.
[02:40:45.183 --> 02:40:48.567]  Now they don't say a word, because that's the model, baby.
[02:40:49.048 --> 02:40:53.272]  What I was thinking is, if they wanted just a rubber stamp, they should have just used Gerald Ford.
[02:40:53.673 --> 02:40:55.094]  They knew he was disposable.
[02:40:55.195 --> 02:40:56.376]  He wasn't going to be re-elected.
[02:40:56.929 --> 02:40:59.070]  So all they'd have to do is... But we weren't ready.
[02:40:59.470 --> 02:41:01.251]  We weren't domesticated enough now.
[02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:04.492]  They've done their litmus test and they think we're retarded pigs.
[02:41:05.153 --> 02:41:05.513]  Okay?
[02:41:05.773 --> 02:41:07.114]  You know, for lack of a better term.
[02:41:07.134 --> 02:41:13.216]  Just gibbering, foaming, just bleeding, bug-level people.
[02:41:13.757 --> 02:41:19.019]  And so they've done the test and they see the population and they think they can move against us.
[02:41:19.379 --> 02:41:21.000]  The problem is they haven't gotten all of us.
[02:41:22.042 --> 02:41:22.202]  Yeah.
[02:41:22.502 --> 02:41:23.542]  Alright, hang in there.
[02:41:23.883 --> 02:41:24.663]  Alright, I appreciate it.
[02:41:25.203 --> 02:41:26.863]  I'm out of control today, I understand that.
[02:41:27.564 --> 02:41:31.185]  That's what happens when you have a record cedar count at 6,000.
[02:41:31.385 --> 02:41:37.146]  In Austin, I've never had allergies, and I have them now, the last few years.
[02:41:37.926 --> 02:41:39.667]  And everybody's getting them.
[02:41:39.687 --> 02:41:40.947]  People that never had them are getting them.
[02:41:40.967 --> 02:41:43.148]  I think it's something else combined with it.
[02:41:43.843 --> 02:42:02.014]  They say chemicals in the body at higher levels can trigger allergies, but it's cedars at like 6,000, it's totally dry, there's dust blowing around everywhere, and if I don't take a Sudafed 12-hour, it's the only thing that works for me, I wouldn't even be here right now, folks.
[02:42:02.055 --> 02:42:10.920]  I've been having headaches so bad, I wake up at 3 in the morning, just, they're not migraines, they're just pounding, and so I take Sudafed 12-hour, and let's be quite frank,
[02:42:13.129 --> 02:42:18.231]  You drink a cup of coffee with that, and I am basically like I've strapped a rocket onto my hind end.
[02:42:18.271 --> 02:42:25.153]  I don't like how I feel right now, but frankly, this feels better than being in the bed with a sinus headache.
[02:42:25.854 --> 02:42:35.777]  And I have no idea why speed, which I don't like, makes the headache go away and makes the sinuses clear.
[02:42:37.938 --> 02:42:39.238]  Well, all I can say is thank God for it.
[02:42:39.258 --> 02:42:42.499]  This is better than...better than... When is it going to rain around here?
[02:42:43.159 --> 02:42:45.360]  It's like 85 degrees right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:49.201]  And the dust is...I'm looking out the window, there's dust blowing.
[02:42:50.341 --> 02:42:54.422]  My car every day is like green with the cedar all over it.
[02:42:55.182 --> 02:42:56.683]  And I've got to talk about Larry Silverstein.
[02:42:56.723 --> 02:42:58.443]  Why am I talking about my allergies?
[02:43:00.445 --> 02:43:01.225]  Oh my goodness.
[02:43:02.046 --> 02:43:10.989]  Larry Silverstein, through the State Department, has now released a statement saying that there were firefighters in the buildings and that's what his bullet meant.
[02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:23.473]  The problem is, we have scores of publications, government reports, the fire department, the police department, the official 9-11 report saying firefighters were never in it, they never decided to battle it.
[02:43:23.794 --> 02:43:25.594]  Giuliani got a call and was told to get out.
[02:43:25.614 --> 02:43:27.615]  He told Peter Jennings that before it even set fire.
[02:43:28.757 --> 02:43:32.120]  Then they say the building tower, the north tower, fell on it.
[02:43:33.441 --> 02:43:35.222]  That is not true officially.
[02:43:35.403 --> 02:43:36.363]  Only dusk hit it.
[02:43:36.864 --> 02:43:37.804]  That is a total lie.
[02:43:37.825 --> 02:43:41.768]  They claim that the north tower fell and knocked out its central support column.
[02:43:42.248 --> 02:43:43.549]  Folks, the building was untouched.
[02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:45.431]  That is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:43:45.671 --> 02:43:53.878]  You do see the central support column blown right before the blast points begin appearing down the side of the structure and then it falls into a perfect little pile.
[02:43:54.638 --> 02:44:01.844]  And earlier we played the clip of Silverstein saying they gave the order to pull it, which is the definition of a controlled demolition.
[02:44:02.224 --> 02:44:11.411]  Then we played a clip of where they were destroying other buildings later in the rebuilding, and they call it pulling it when they pull Building 6 and destroy what's left of Building 6 that has not collapsed.
[02:44:12.352 --> 02:44:15.834]  Then we have another clip of Dan Rather saying it looks like a controlled demolition.
[02:44:16.555 --> 02:44:21.919]  Did you get the clip of the firefighters where they're saying it looked like detonators and bombs in the building?
[02:44:23.351 --> 02:44:24.672]  And again, this is an edited clip.
[02:44:24.772 --> 02:44:30.818]  If you want to watch the unedited clip, it is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the WTC7 sections.
[02:44:30.838 --> 02:44:33.921]  The only thing that's cut out is the S word.
[02:44:34.401 --> 02:44:36.163]  We always like to tell you that up front.
[02:44:36.864 --> 02:44:39.166]  Let's play the firefighters first.
[02:44:39.786 --> 02:44:42.128]  And then we'll replay those Silverstein clips.
[02:44:42.148 --> 02:44:43.149]  This is a big deal.
[02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:44.671]  They're being forced to respond.
[02:44:44.731 --> 02:44:45.872]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:44:46.423 --> 02:44:48.264]  We made it outside, we made it about a block.
[02:44:48.644 --> 02:44:52.486]  We made it at least two blocks, and we started running.
[02:44:52.626 --> 02:44:54.767]  Floor by floor, instead of popping out.
[02:44:54.827 --> 02:44:56.048]  It was just, it detonated.
[02:44:56.088 --> 02:44:57.749]  Yeah, it detonated.
[02:44:57.769 --> 02:44:59.170]  We planned to take down a building.
[02:44:59.250 --> 02:45:00.590]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:01.251]  All the way down.
[02:45:01.271 --> 02:45:02.691]  I was watching it, and I ran.
[02:45:02.711 --> 02:45:03.592]  I just ran up west.
[02:45:03.612 --> 02:45:06.733]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of teeth went down.
[02:45:06.833 --> 02:45:08.014]  I could not run it.
[02:45:08.114 --> 02:45:09.255]  I could not run it.
[02:45:09.275 --> 02:45:09.815]  So what'd you do?
[02:45:09.855 --> 02:45:12.937]  I jumped behind a battalion car, I hit up to the car, I was waiting to die.
[02:45:14.408 --> 02:45:18.793]  Okay, and again, to even do this justice, I guess we should add to this article that Paul wrote.
[02:45:18.813 --> 02:45:20.334]  He did a good job in just a few hours writing it.
[02:45:20.634 --> 02:45:27.321]  We should add that the UL underwriters did tests with models and said it was absolutely impossible, still doesn't weaken until 3,000 degrees.
[02:45:27.701 --> 02:45:30.504]  Jet fuel burns at around 1,200 to 1,400.
[02:45:31.364 --> 02:45:32.425]  Paper burns even lower.
[02:45:33.627 --> 02:45:35.008]  None of the buildings should have collapsed.
[02:45:35.028 --> 02:45:38.071]  There were clear squibs blowing up down the sides, the blast points.
[02:45:39.341 --> 02:45:43.185]  Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise, but we were meant to think it was the Arabs.
[02:45:43.205 --> 02:45:57.518]  You know, it's the same thing over and over and over again, and we then have Silverstein taking out record insurance policies two months before it happens, buying out the towers from the Port Authority, which is a Rockefeller front, and then
[02:45:58.519 --> 02:46:00.320]  Magically, they all blow up and collapse.
[02:46:00.641 --> 02:46:08.826]  We have firefighter engineering saying there was a cover-up of the debris, and that it looked like bombs were probably in there, and there's a big cover-up going on, and what happens is impossible.
[02:46:08.846 --> 02:46:12.388]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[02:46:12.709 --> 02:46:19.693]  And then the 9-11 committee with Tower 1 and 2, which were also blown up by controlled demolitions, we even have the blast points.
[02:46:19.733 --> 02:46:22.255]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, just like in Las Vegas, and then it collapses.
[02:46:23.092 --> 02:46:30.234]  The buildings fell, in some cases faster than gravity, which can only happen faster than a lead bowling ball, folks, can fall.
[02:46:30.634 --> 02:46:35.935]  Because that can only happen if whole floors are simply evaporated, which was all that dust.
[02:46:36.215 --> 02:46:37.636]  Massive explosives in there.
[02:46:38.016 --> 02:46:47.598]  Then we had molten steel for over a month at over 3,000 degrees, which only thermite bombs can create.
[02:46:48.218 --> 02:46:56.305]  And we have the top physicist in engineering there at Brigham Young University saying the same thing.
[02:46:56.345 --> 02:46:58.207]  But oh, let's just ignore the scientists.
[02:46:58.687 --> 02:47:04.893]  Then we have the head of the mining and demolition school in New Mexico go public and say, clearly, bombs.
[02:47:04.973 --> 02:47:06.254]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:47:06.534 --> 02:47:11.579]  It takes them weeks, in some cases months, to do a controlled demolition as good as they did in Building 7.
[02:47:11.959 --> 02:47:14.061]  I mean, it is a textbook beauty.
[02:47:15.871 --> 02:47:17.612]  It is a textbook beauty.
[02:47:17.972 --> 02:47:20.194]  And then he slips up and says, we gave the order to pull it.
[02:47:20.454 --> 02:47:21.655]  You know why he had to say that?
[02:47:22.195 --> 02:47:24.177]  Because it was on NPR radio that day.
[02:47:25.257 --> 02:47:27.539]  They may just demolish the building to save others.
[02:47:27.639 --> 02:47:28.359]  What does that mean?
[02:47:28.399 --> 02:47:31.401]  And even if that was true, it takes weeks to plant the bombs.
[02:47:32.062 --> 02:47:36.445]  You see, because some people on the ground were talking, so the spin, things kind of got out of control.
[02:47:36.485 --> 02:47:38.886]  So they say, oh yeah, yeah, we might blow it to save the buildings.
[02:47:39.266 --> 02:47:39.927]  Oh, okay.
[02:47:40.896 --> 02:47:42.817]  As if three little fires was going to make it fall.
[02:47:43.038 --> 02:47:48.181]  But now the State Department, the same one that's attacked this network, attacked talk show hosts on this network.
[02:47:49.042 --> 02:47:58.589]  They had a big State Department thing about the conspiracy theories and the dangerous groups that are taking over America and how we're convincing everyone and how we're very crafty and very sneaky.
[02:47:59.109 --> 02:48:01.031]  Why, we say China sells organs.
[02:48:02.213 --> 02:48:08.315]  And then, on their own State Department website, somebody who isn't a propagandist, there's a whole section about how they do sell organs.
[02:48:08.715 --> 02:48:15.837]  And then now it's come out in all the big mainstream papers that they have huge ad campaigns to come get, quote, healthy, fresh organs.
[02:48:15.917 --> 02:48:17.398]  It translates in English, fresh.
[02:48:17.878 --> 02:48:18.958]  Look, we have fresh produce.
[02:48:19.418 --> 02:48:23.900]  And it's been all over the news about the melted down dead slaves being used in the collagen for your lips.
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:27.081]  For your arrogant preening wife.
[02:48:28.441 --> 02:48:30.582]  So, your decadent scumbag wife.
[02:48:32.083 --> 02:48:33.126]  So, I don't want to hear it.
[02:48:33.146 --> 02:48:34.609]  I mean, oh, it's a conspiracy?
[02:48:34.649 --> 02:48:35.672]  They're selling organs?
[02:48:35.692 --> 02:48:38.198]  I mean, it's in the New York Times and Washington Post!
[02:48:38.438 --> 02:48:41.285]  I mean, we get attacked for reporting the sun comes up in the morning!
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:43.401]  I'm sorry we see straight!
[02:48:43.581 --> 02:48:44.862]  We know you're murdering criminals!
[02:48:44.982 --> 02:48:45.983]  We're gonna expose ya!
[02:48:46.464 --> 02:48:47.965]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:48.145 --> 02:48:51.247]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.368 --> 02:48:55.271]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.311 --> 02:48:59.554]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.894 --> 02:49:03.657]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.818 --> 02:49:05.759]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.819 --> 02:49:09.122]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:09.162 --> 02:49:10.243]  The medical bills!
[02:49:11.844 --> 02:49:13.865]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:14.005 --> 02:49:17.046]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:17.226 --> 02:49:20.128]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.588 --> 02:49:26.711]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:27.231 --> 02:49:31.033]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:31.433 --> 02:49:32.793]  Order your video today.

[02:49:46.042 --> 02:49:49.946]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:50.166 --> 02:49:55.591]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:55.871 --> 02:50:06.241]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:06.421 --> 02:50:10.745]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:10.865 --> 02:50:11.726]  We're good to go!
[02:50:30.729 --> 02:50:34.935]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[02:50:47.358 --> 02:50:47.799]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:03.300]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.176 --> 02:51:35.257]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.437 --> 02:51:41.358]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:47.240 --> 02:51:49.961]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.981 --> 02:51:53.862]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:01.221 --> 02:52:05.082]  A few of the little tidbits here, but I said I'd go to Steve and Cliff, so just quickly.
[02:52:05.142 --> 02:52:06.582]  Steve in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[02:52:06.602 --> 02:52:06.962]  Go ahead.
[02:52:08.723 --> 02:52:09.603]  Good to talk to you, Steve.
[02:52:09.623 --> 02:52:10.183]  You're on the air.
[02:52:13.304 --> 02:52:14.504]  Well, that's an exciting phone call.
[02:52:14.524 --> 02:52:15.985]  Let's go to Cliff in Utah.
[02:52:16.005 --> 02:52:16.745]  Cliff in Utah.
[02:52:16.765 --> 02:52:17.265]  You're on the air.
[02:52:17.305 --> 02:52:17.905]  Go ahead, Cliff.
[02:52:18.085 --> 02:52:18.625]  How you doing?
[02:52:18.665 --> 02:52:19.546]  Kudos to you, Alex.
[02:52:19.586 --> 02:52:20.486]  Kudos to you, my friend.
[02:52:20.726 --> 02:52:25.167]  I tried to get in so hard to talk to Michael because he's an astute guy on the Constitution.
[02:52:25.985 --> 02:52:33.314]  Okay, the next time he's on, ask him about the 7th Amendment right to a jury trial at historical case law.
[02:52:34.095 --> 02:52:36.398]  The reason is because if you can get a trial...
[02:52:36.946 --> 02:52:40.007]  That way, you don't have to follow what the judge said.
[02:52:40.047 --> 02:52:41.688]  He has to follow historical case law.
[02:52:41.708 --> 02:52:42.448]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:52:42.488 --> 02:52:45.949]  You see, instead of following the Constitution, they go, oh, we'll have a U.S.
[02:52:46.029 --> 02:52:47.309]  Code that codifies it.
[02:52:47.390 --> 02:52:50.331]  Then they can change the Constitution without getting amendments.
[02:52:50.711 --> 02:52:51.791]  That way, it's the same thing.
[02:52:52.251 --> 02:52:53.592]  They change the courts.
[02:52:53.932 --> 02:52:58.893]  They change the nature of its officers and how it works until, look at the grand juries.
[02:52:58.953 --> 02:52:59.514]  Rubber stamps.
[02:52:59.554 --> 02:53:00.174]  Look at juries.
[02:53:00.214 --> 02:53:00.794]  Rubber stamps.
[02:53:01.094 --> 02:53:02.134]  You're absolutely right.
[02:53:02.154 --> 02:53:03.375]  And see, cops and people
[02:53:03.975 --> 02:53:06.057]  Well, I don't think this is all the lawful system.
[02:53:06.137 --> 02:53:08.458]  No, it's a, it's a, it's a counterfeit.
[02:53:08.798 --> 02:53:17.444]  And also, too, that if you refuse to give your name, you know, when they ask you and tell them you're not going to give out any information like that, they can't proceed right then.
[02:53:18.465 --> 02:53:21.387]  Your name has to be listed on the docket and right before the court.
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:24.822]  That's a really good stalling tactic.
[02:53:24.882 --> 02:53:27.084]  You can pay a lawyer $10,000 to do it each time.
[02:53:27.585 --> 02:53:28.426]  No, no, no.
[02:53:28.446 --> 02:53:29.207]  You do it yourself.
[02:53:29.227 --> 02:53:29.887]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:53:29.927 --> 02:53:30.648]  Or you can do it yourself.
[02:53:30.868 --> 02:53:38.497]  But you don't have to follow, go under equity law, administrative or statutory rule if you do it historically wise under the 7th Amendment.
[02:53:38.857 --> 02:53:44.640]  Well, the problem is a lot of that is accurate and works a lot of times, but some of these judges and people are just going so rogue and so criminal.
[02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:45.380]  That's correct.
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:58.906]  You know, they'll go, there's not even a law, I'm just going to hold you for a year and a half in contempt, and even though the charge is six months in contempt, six months, just bye-bye, we're not going to force drug you while you're at it, you'll be a, you'll be a lobster head by the time we're done with you.
[02:53:59.186 --> 02:54:05.429]  But the next time Michael gets on there, ask him his opinion and he'll tell you the same thing, but he knows the Constitution very well.
[02:54:06.058 --> 02:54:06.838]  Well, he's a good guy.
[02:54:06.858 --> 02:54:12.220]  We need to get him to be a little more hardcore, but I know he's listening right now, driving to wherever else he's going, but he's a great guy.
[02:54:12.521 --> 02:54:12.941]  You bet.
[02:54:12.961 --> 02:54:13.881]  Well, you take care, Alex.
[02:54:13.921 --> 02:54:14.221]  You bet.
[02:54:14.281 --> 02:54:16.282]  No, I've known back there for a long time.
[02:54:16.362 --> 02:54:19.223]  He really is a good patriot and knows all about the New World Order.
[02:54:19.803 --> 02:54:23.465]  It's just that, you know, I personally, my strategy,
[02:54:24.085 --> 02:54:25.727]  And of course, I'm not in the arena like he is.
[02:54:25.747 --> 02:54:27.609]  It wouldn't just be, hey, I'm the alternative.
[02:54:27.969 --> 02:54:30.052]  It would be, hey, we need to have a revolution in this country.
[02:54:30.072 --> 02:54:31.033]  We need to change things.
[02:54:31.273 --> 02:54:33.936]  They're violating our Bill of Rights and Constitution, which he is going to do.
[02:54:34.256 --> 02:54:35.798]  But you notice how simple some people are.
[02:54:35.838 --> 02:54:37.219]  Well, I'm not worried about the simple Simons.
[02:54:37.239 --> 02:54:38.581]  A lot of them don't even vote.
[02:54:38.621 --> 02:54:43.246]  There are a lot of informed, dynamic, intelligent people, especially in Central Texas.
[02:54:44.107 --> 02:54:45.849]  And they'd like to vote for somebody real.
[02:54:46.992 --> 02:54:47.813]  So that's exciting.
[02:54:47.893 --> 02:54:50.855]  A scary thing about state-sponsored medical terrorism in Texas.
[02:54:50.875 --> 02:54:55.960]  Authorities arrest parents, kidnap their teenage daughter and force her through chemotherapy against her will.
[02:54:56.900 --> 02:54:57.940]  This is happening again.
[02:54:57.980 --> 02:54:59.541]  We had their parents on.
[02:54:59.961 --> 02:55:11.704]  Months after a Texas teenager was diagnosed with cancer, state authorities have finally decided to let her return home to her family after a long legal battle in which Texas officials, not the girl's parents, attempted to determine the course of the treatment for her disease.
[02:55:11.924 --> 02:55:14.024]  Her cancer was gone, but they tried to keep it going.
[02:55:14.504 --> 02:55:15.625]  Just a nightmare case.
[02:55:15.665 --> 02:55:17.925]  I need to get them back on the show.
[02:55:18.385 --> 02:55:20.426]  Errol Cherone is hanging on by his fingernails.
[02:55:21.406 --> 02:55:29.353]  Barry Hamish is saying, a great Israeli writer over there, he's saying, a Jewish writer, he's saying it looks like it may be foul play by people even more extreme than him.
[02:55:30.834 --> 02:55:33.436]  People more extreme than Ariel Sharon.
[02:55:34.937 --> 02:55:36.899]  We are, frankly, out of time.
[02:55:36.919 --> 02:55:39.621]  There's an NSA whistleblower asked to testify.
[02:55:39.641 --> 02:55:41.722]  And of course,
[02:55:43.783 --> 02:55:44.844]  That's the story about Bill Gertz.
[02:55:44.864 --> 02:55:47.105]  That's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:47.605 --> 02:55:52.587]  There is only a few days left to get almost half a year free on a yearly subscription.

[02:56:11.496 --> 02:56:15.059]  Commit to coming in and joining us for the big win against the Globalist.
[02:56:15.460 --> 02:56:17.581]  Get involved in something that really matters, folks.
[02:56:17.621 --> 02:56:18.782]  Join a real team.

[02:56:21.625 --> 02:56:22.826]  Death to the New World Order?
[02:56:22.906 --> 02:56:24.006]  God bless you all!
