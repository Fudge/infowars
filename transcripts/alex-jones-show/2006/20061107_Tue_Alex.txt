[00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.506]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.247]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.067]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:11.508]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:13.149]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.510]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:29.995]  It's been a massive success.
[00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:36.637]  It's aired now four separate times nationally and internationally on Home Box Office, HBO.
[00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:41.178]  She'll be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:00:41.338 --> 00:00:50.500]  Bev Harris, who was behind making the film, Hacking Democracy, will be joining us with this exclusive Election Day interview.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.941]  I'm told she's not doing any other interviews on radio, but she'll be joining us for a full hour in the third hour.
[00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.366]  Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com with his excellent analysis as well as he tracks the election fraud with his team.
[00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:12.092]  We'll be joining us from Hawaii in the second hour, riding shotgun with me into the third.
[00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:17.417]  We will also have wide open phones specifically on the election.
[00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.219]  I'm not going to screen your calls, I never do.
[00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.140]  But I would like to hear you comment on what's happening with the election.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.000]  And you can piggyback any other comments you'd like onto that.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.021]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:28.101]  800-259-9231.
[00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:28.601]  It is November 7, 2006.
[00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:29.561]  Super Tuesday.
[00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:30.041]  It is Election Day.
[00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:33.502]  And in every major battleground state where Republicans are battling to maintain control,
[00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.802]  Voting machines are flipping votes.
[00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:54.062]  They are freezing.
[00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:57.083]  They are frying coast to coast.
[00:01:57.143 --> 00:02:00.624]  They're doing what they were designed to do.
[00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:07.026]  Also, the GOP has revealed themselves by coming out on the GOP
[00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:08.808]  We're good to go.
[00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:45.300]  But the neocons on their website say that, oh no, in the last two elections, no exit polls have been wrong.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.527]  Well, yes, since you've been engaging in massive coast-to-coast fraud.
[00:02:51.727 --> 00:03:04.825]  There are so many thousands of stories of election fraud and engineers that work for the companies going public and saying they were hired to engage in fraud and other engineers going public saying it's easily hacked and other outside engineers and computer experts demonstrating the hacks.
[00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:08.390]  The computers are designed to be remotely and secretly accessed.
[00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:10.536]  And that is now happening.
[00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:12.998]  One of their favorite tactics is to simply flip votes.
[00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:17.202]  That's been happening in early voting in Travis County and also down in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:26.970]  And in Austin, Texas, people I know personally, who are very computer savvy, say that it's flipping their votes, they're voting Democrat, they're voting third party, and it's telling them that they voted for Republicans.
[00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:34.098]  But the big news here is the Republicans have the nerve to come out preemptively and say, don't trust the exit polls!
[00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:42.002]  Yeah, don't trust all the other polls, scientific polls, that show a massive Democratic and anti-incumbent sweep.
[00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.183]  There are also some Democratic incumbents being thrown out.
[00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:51.026]  And in every case, the polls are showing a massive Democratic landslide, which is a good thing.
[00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:53.048]  We're not saying the Democrats are going to save us.
[00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:54.709]  They're just the other arm of the New World Order.
[00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.111]  But it will cause a separation of powers.
[00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.772]  The founding fathers called for it.
[00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:04.116]  It will break up the monopoly of the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary that President Bush has.
[00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:11.762]  It will allow a move towards impeachment hearings that will damage this criminal regime to a great extent and hopefully put their move
[00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:17.806]  Uh, to set up an imperial dictatorship here domestically on ice and their move to attack Iran.
[00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:21.648]  Of course, you have Hillary and Lieberman and others calling for an attack on Iran.
[00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:29.374]  So we have to understand that wing of the Democratic Party will still be in control of any revolution the Democrats are able to bring forward.
[00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:34.737]  Nancy Pelosi will be there to ride herd over the small Democratic majority that may be coming into the House.
[00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:41.782]  It would be a huge landslide, but they're fighting to steal and abscond and destroy the electoral process.
[00:04:42.342 --> 00:04:49.949]  In this Constitutional Republic, we're witnessing the third straight election in a row being stolen, being blocked.
[00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.672]  But it's a big job to block a landslide.
[00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.273]  They may still fail.
[00:04:54.573 --> 00:04:55.294]  We'll track it.
[00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:56.535]  We'll chronicle it.
[00:04:56.975 --> 00:04:57.396]  Election 2006!
[00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:07.715]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:09.975]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:18.037]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:25.778]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:33.020]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:37.579]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.342]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:43.743]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.123 --> 00:05:48.046]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:07.578]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:14.002]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:07:13.137 --> 00:07:19.222]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:06.250]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.932]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.013 --> 00:08:14.695]  Alright, it is election day 2006.
[00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:26.523]  Bev Harris behind the big HBO special that has aired several times the last few days since Thursday, Hacking Democracy.
[00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:27.742]  I think so.
[00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:48.976]  We did find Hacking Democracy up on Google and YouTube video.
[00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:55.158]  We have links to it up on JonesReport.com, and I'd grab it and host it on your server while you can.
[00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:56.518]  I don't think it'll be up there long.
[00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:04.121]  Plus, a censored parts of a Simpsons, that I'm now being told was censored, that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:07.142]  I guess Rupert Murdoch didn't like the parallels with the war.
[00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:14.229]  Tying it into War of the Worlds, in a type of satirical spoof.
[00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:22.611]  So a lot of information you need up on PrisonPlanet.com, but you can go grab the Hacking Democracy up on JonesReport.com.
[00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:34.254]  We have a detailed report up there about Diebold, that we wrote and put together, tried to block, the big voting machine company tried to block the release of that film last week.
[00:09:35.034 --> 00:09:36.415]  So this is the type of stuff we deal with.
[00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:37.875]  Speaking of films being blocked,
[00:09:39.727 --> 00:09:44.848]  And then I'm going to go directly into massive election fraud, massive quote malfunctions.
[00:09:46.108 --> 00:09:49.029]  Big Boo Boo, the GOP, have been caught in here.
[00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:53.289]  The hubris, their hubris is giving them away.
[00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:54.590]  That's coming up in just a minute or two.
[00:09:54.610 --> 00:10:07.192]  I told you last week that I wanted to reserve judgment concerning Barnes & Noble and Borders Books and other big chains around the country.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:33.068]  How it was very strange that we knew they'd taken delivery, many of these outlets, of thousands or hundreds of videos, depending on the outlet, and that there was some type of weird censorship going on, and even stores that we confirmed through the distributor had taken delivery, physically, at their outlets, not just their warehouses, that they were not putting them on store shelves.
[00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:34.688]  My new film, Terror Storm.
[00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:37.309]  We have confirmed that.
[00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:51.601]  We have confirmed that places like Netflix, when you try to go order it to have it delivered to your door to rent it, when you try to put it into your queue, as it's called, of films you want sent to you, that it tells you a very long time until you get it.
[00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:57.484]  And that's because they quickly sold out the 500 copies that they had.
[00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:02.088]  And last time I checked, they weren't reordering.
[00:11:02.268 --> 00:11:04.209]  Oh, so what if something instantly sells out?
[00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:06.189]  We don't want to order more.
[00:11:06.369 --> 00:11:09.630]  Or, so what if people are here showing up wanting it?
[00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.990]  We're not going to put it on our shelves.
[00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:19.452]  And at the very same time, Amazon.com, we rushed to number 9.
[00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:20.552]  I saw number 9.
[00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:21.433]  I'm told it went to number 8.
[00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:22.733]  We didn't get a screenshot of it.
[00:11:23.053 --> 00:11:24.653]  But I physically saw it at number 9.
[00:11:24.993 --> 00:11:26.654]  The lowest screenshot we got was it at 17.
[00:11:28.524 --> 00:11:33.027]  That is, you know, my staff was here Friday and took a screenshot of it at 17.
[00:11:33.808 --> 00:11:35.509]  But I did see it at 9.
[00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:39.692]  Again, I'm told by someone I trust they saw it at 8 Friday night.
[00:11:41.713 --> 00:11:42.714]  Or was it Saturday night?
[00:11:42.754 --> 00:11:43.474]  I don't remember now.
[00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:46.536]  The point is that we know it went into the top 100.
[00:11:46.897 --> 00:11:47.577]  It's still in the top 100.
[00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:52.881]  It's been in the top 100 since last Wednesday, peaking over the weekend at number 9.
[00:11:54.876 --> 00:12:07.340]  And we know for a fact that Amazon did order an amount, did sell out by Thursday, two days after posting it, but instead of saying ships today, it would say ships in six to twelve days.
[00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:18.639]  Well now if you click through to order it says four to six weeks when we know that they reordered on Friday and it takes two days for the warehouse to ship it to their three warehouses.
[00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:21.902]  So it should say it takes four days to ship.
[00:12:21.962 --> 00:12:23.964]  Now it should say in stock.
[00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:26.046]  It is now in stock at Amazon.
[00:12:26.567 --> 00:12:31.972]  I made the call this morning and confirmed it but they're still saying on their main page six to
[00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:33.173]  We're good to go.
[00:12:58.746 --> 00:13:01.227]  So there is clear monkey business going on.
[00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:11.852]  As you know, Google admits in a press release that they erased our total tally numbers off of the 20 plus versions of Terror Storm people had uploaded to Google Video.
[00:13:11.872 --> 00:13:17.054]  So we already had that working against us that, you know, they count the one video as what's the highest ranking.
[00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:18.495]  It's like, you know, if you had
[00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:30.493]  Twenty horses in the race, you own them all, you tallied it all together, you won every place, but it's over now, six million, I quit counting a few weeks ago, downloads, and they admitted that they had erased them.
[00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:36.637]  They admitted that they had gone in, but it was an accident, over and over again doing it.
[00:13:37.938 --> 00:13:39.439]  So without a shadow of a doubt,
[00:13:40.894 --> 00:13:45.837]  There is a concerted effort to frustrate you in the purchase of TerrorStorm.
[00:13:46.298 --> 00:13:50.300]  There is an effort to knock it out of the top 100, where most people will find it and watch it.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.322]  You stay in the top 100, stay in the top 20 or so of Amazon.
[00:13:57.032 --> 00:13:59.893]  Again, garnered that much more exposure.
[00:14:00.213 --> 00:14:12.158]  The stores decide what they're going to order off of Amazon as one of their key, I'm told V-key with video, indices, indicators that is used by the big distributors and purchasers and chains.
[00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.719]  We know that Google is doing everything they can to erase our numbers and knock us out of the top 100.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.722]  And we know that, I mean again, they tried to block, Diebold tried to block the release of the
[00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.320]  A film about electronic voting machine fraud?
[00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:29.501]  At every level!
[00:14:30.682 --> 00:14:39.506]  You could have people like Colonel Craig Roberts, best-selling author, three books in the best-seller list of the New York Times, sold millions of copies of one, an all-time best-seller in non-fiction.
[00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:48.151]  I mean, it's in the top, you know, of all-time best-sellers, One Shot, One Kill, and, uh, you know, Marine Corps Sniper in Vietnam.
[00:14:48.831 --> 00:14:54.514]  Well, he writes other books that I think, frankly, are much better, and they're very, and he's told by every publisher in New York,
[00:14:55.635 --> 00:15:01.779]  We're CIA controlled, and that letter came out in Senate hearings, Operation Mockingbird, and you're not allowed to publish this.
[00:15:01.819 --> 00:15:06.742]  So he self-publishes, and people even want it, and you have to go in and special order it.
[00:15:06.802 --> 00:15:10.364]  You see, this is how they operate.
[00:15:10.424 --> 00:15:14.047]  They won't let us on the playing field, because we'll kick their butts.
[00:15:14.607 --> 00:15:16.308]  Excuse my mild French there.
[00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.731]  And I know we can beat them!
[00:15:19.992 --> 00:15:23.715]  That's why they're moving to block non-net neutrality.
[00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:25.697]  That's why they're moving to shut down the web.
[00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:27.539]  It's happening right now, piecemeal.
[00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:30.101]  A finger, then an arm, then a leg.
[00:15:30.942 --> 00:15:33.364]  Now they're cutting into the basic organs of the internet.
[00:15:33.824 --> 00:15:35.386]  And it's because we're winning.
[00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:45.185]  There's all these big mainstream news articles every day, panicking, saying, we're losing, we're imploding, the Internet's taking over, the new media, they're killing us, oh!
[00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:50.766]  Eighteen year old kids have websites bigger than major papers in a month, oh!
[00:15:50.886 --> 00:15:52.326]  Well, you just won't tell the truth!
[00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.767]  You just won't give people real information!
[00:15:55.907 --> 00:16:00.048]  And so you're going to try to keep us off the field, because you're a bunch of cheaters!
[00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.149]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.631]  We want our country back!
[00:16:06.871 --> 00:16:08.071]  We want our planet back!
[00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:10.752]  We don't want your stinkin' foreign-owned toll roads.
[00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:13.393]  We don't want your stinkin' militarized police.
[00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:26.078]  We don't want your stinkin' pervert Republicans snortin' their methamphetamine and with their gay prostitutes when they're not having their Monday morning prayer meeting with Bush, the limp-wristed commie.
[00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:29.380]  We're sick of you!
[00:16:30.268 --> 00:16:43.578]  We know you're criminals, and we're tired of it, and you go ahead and try to block the web, and you go ahead and try to block TerrorStorm, and you go ahead and call the theater chains and call TV stations and threaten them not to interview Aaron Russo or carry his film.
[00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:44.459]  We've got it.
[00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:46.700]  We're carrying American freedom to fascism.
[00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:54.026]  Believe me, folks, you know you're hitting the nerve when you've got the big guns trying to silence you and the big guns trying to block you.
[00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:00.699]  And that's why every one of our AM and FM affiliates is so precious.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:11.487]  I thank every one of you, whether it's WBCR, or KCXL, or Stations in Ohio, or Upstate New York, or Florida, or Texas, or California, all of you, thank you!
[00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:18.391]  And I want listeners to support those affiliates, that growing list of affiliates, by the way, and I want you to support their sponsors.
[00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:20.853]  If you've got a local business, I want you to sponsor them.
[00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:29.167]  Because it's such a special thing to not just be on the internet, but to be on mainstream AM and FM, live stations like KLBJ 590 here in Austin.
[00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:31.988]  You know, the point is, we are mainstream.
[00:17:32.008 --> 00:17:33.149]  We're taking the mainstream.
[00:17:33.189 --> 00:17:34.230]  We're taking over.
[00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.031]  We're going to win.
[00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:39.573]  We're going to kick you in the hind end, New World Order.
[00:17:39.853 --> 00:17:40.894]  We're not stopping.
[00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:43.255]  And I hope you realize that.
[00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:45.597]  Alright, here's the news.
[00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:47.958]  And I got Paul Watson on this right now, writing a big article.
[00:17:48.238 --> 00:17:49.359]  It'll be up in the next two hours.
[00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:49.799]  Get it.
[00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:51.140]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:17:52.063 --> 00:18:19.672]  We are seeing systematic election fraud, the exact same pattern we witnessed in 2000, 2002, 2004, but more so the same pattern, the exact same pattern, it's similar to 2000, but exact same, 2002, 2004, where votes are being flipped, where you go into precincts and it's a completely wrong election, it's the previous election, we're now confirming that just happened in Austin,
[00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:23.446]  Got our witnesses coming on here, lining them up right now.
[00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:28.949]  We are confirming coast-to-coast in key battlegrounds.
[00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:33.671]  If you take the states, and these articles don't point it out, you have to go then pull up the maps of the battleground states.
[00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:44.916]  Every state, especially in the Northeast, the Midwest, the West, every key battleground state where Democrats were 5, 10, 12 points ahead, and where every poll was showing they were going to win,
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.361]  This is where the machines are crashing.
[00:18:47.381 --> 00:18:48.702]  This is where they're flipping the votes.
[00:18:49.082 --> 00:18:52.523]  This is where computer-savvy people are going in and saying, that thing flipped my vote.
[00:18:53.184 --> 00:18:56.105]  It's happening in key battleground cities around the country.
[00:18:57.426 --> 00:19:04.769]  Even in red state strongholds, where you have little blue pockets, the malfunctions are only in those areas.
[00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.951]  I spent an hour this morning comparing the maps.
[00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:15.784]  I hope Paul Watson will go pull up the maps that show the battleground states when he writes this article, and then show how it's in those battleground states.
[00:19:15.824 --> 00:19:17.646]  I saw the pattern this morning.
[00:19:17.706 --> 00:19:19.167]  No one else seems to be getting it.
[00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:24.973]  Oh, they're reporting there's all these problems, but not that it's everywhere where there's a contested race.
[00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:29.039]  Voting machines woes cause early delays.
[00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:29.860]  This is AP.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:40.188]  Voting machines began wreaking havoc the minute the polls opened Tuesday, delaying voters in dozens of Indiana and Ohio precincts, and leaving some in Florida with little choice but to turn to paper ballots instead.
[00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.251]  I've got like 20 articles.
[00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:45.091]  It's all over the country.
[00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:45.832]  It's the same thing.
[00:19:46.733 --> 00:19:48.974]  And we'll get to the really big news on the other side.
[00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:52.437]  The GOP revealing themselves.
[00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:54.146]  Keep it locked in!
[00:19:54.246 --> 00:20:06.911]  Infowars.com PrisonBlinded.com Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:09.832]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:10.632 --> 00:20:18.995]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:24.883]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:35.529]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:36.009 --> 00:20:38.330]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.331]  For more information call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:40.391]  702-953-0267.

[00:20:53.076 --> 00:20:55.179]  That's www.lazmedinc.com.
[00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.691]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:21:02.751 --> 00:21:03.511]  Today is November 7th, 2006.
[00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:04.052]  Gold opened at $6.26.
[00:21:04.092 --> 00:21:06.413]  And one ounce gold coins could be purchased for $6.52.80 and $3.27.42 for half ounce coins.
[00:21:06.453 --> 00:21:06.814]  That's $6.52.80 and $3.27.42.
[00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:13.098]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:21:29.569 --> 00:21:32.830]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.711]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:21:36.771 --> 00:21:39.792]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:21:40.252 --> 00:21:43.033]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:21:43.293 --> 00:21:43.733]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:43.813 --> 00:21:45.213]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.

[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.161]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:04.666]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.247 --> 00:22:11.813]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[00:22:12.573 --> 00:22:17.738]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:19.152]  We're good.
[00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:39.035]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:02.576]  Terrorism!
[00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:03.496]  Terrorism!
[00:23:03.596 --> 00:23:09.661]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:11.502]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:23:11.742 --> 00:23:14.224]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:23:14.624 --> 00:23:29.194]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:23:29.234 --> 00:23:29.535]  government.
[00:23:29.715 --> 00:23:31.516]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:23:31.876 --> 00:23:37.801]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:42.425]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:14.163]  Looking at Austin, Texas as a microcosm of the rest of the country, a Democrat stronghold
[00:24:28.399 --> 00:24:33.763]  We are confirming that when you go into Vote Democratic, it flips it and votes Republican.
[00:24:34.283 --> 00:24:38.486]  We've also just talked to Vicki Karp, who's going to try to get a line in so we can get a quick report from her.
[00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:41.708]  She heads up the big vote rescue here in Austin, Texas.
[00:24:41.728 --> 00:24:42.949]  They're doing parallel elections.
[00:24:43.329 --> 00:24:46.572]  They're doing exit polling, doing a great job with volunteers out there.
[00:24:46.992 --> 00:24:52.556]  Today, in one of the suburbs of Austin, it's actually the last election in the computers.
[00:24:54.105 --> 00:25:04.153]  I mean, it's not just the fraud of these computers, it's that they're so shoddily built and designed to be entered by a backdoor, and that it's all proprietary, and you're not even allowed to know how it operates.
[00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:07.635]  Many of the companies have wireless internet cards hooked into them secretly.
[00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:15.842]  People bought them, you know, claiming that they're a precinct, claiming that they're a municipality, and then they've done tests, and it's designed for fraud.
[00:25:16.943 --> 00:25:20.025]  The codes, two different voting machines have been put up on the internet.
[00:25:21.097 --> 00:25:45.947]  Inadvertently by companies and they've admitted that it's accurate because they get real mad about it later and claim that it's proprietary and start suing people and it's designed for fraud and then all over the country all over the nation from Florida to Ohio to Pennsylvania the reports of machines having problems and again it's called problems
[00:25:46.784 --> 00:25:50.765]  I guess, you know, if you catch a bank robber robbing the bank, you just tell the cops, well, I was having a problem!
[00:25:51.546 --> 00:25:53.606]  I came in and pointed a gun and robbed the teller.
[00:25:53.967 --> 00:25:54.907]  It was just a problem.
[00:25:54.947 --> 00:25:55.667]  It was an accident.
[00:25:55.727 --> 00:25:57.588]  No, it's not an accident in many cases.
[00:25:57.628 --> 00:26:01.529]  In some cases, it is if they're so shoddily built and no oversight is allowed.
[00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:04.750]  Even the municipalities aren't allowed to know how the machines work.
[00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.051]  It's just, oh, trust us!
[00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:12.013]  Never mind the fact that all the major companies are run by former CIA directors or former NSA directors or deputy directors.
[00:26:13.624 --> 00:26:14.324]  This is AP.
[00:26:14.384 --> 00:26:16.786]  Voting machine woes cause early delays.
[00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:27.312]  Voting machines began wreaking havoc the minute the polls opened today, delaying voters in dozens of Indiana and Ohio precincts and leaving some in Florida with little choice but to turn to paper ballots instead.
[00:26:27.872 --> 00:26:36.817]  In Cleveland, voters rolled their eyes as election workers fumbled with new voting machines that they couldn't get to start properly.
[00:26:37.617 --> 00:26:40.319]  We got five machines, one of them's got to work, said,
[00:26:41.582 --> 00:26:47.825]  Willett Shoelink, a troubleshooter from the Chattanooga County, Ohio election boards.
[00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:58.669]  Election officials in Delaware County, Indiana, plan to seek a court order to extend voting after an apparent computer error prevented voters from casting ballots in 75 precincts.
[00:26:59.149 --> 00:27:06.672]  Delaware County Clerk Karen Wernger said the cards that activate the machines were programmed incorrectly.
[00:27:07.053 --> 00:27:10.514]  We were working with precincts one by one over the telephone to get the problem fixed.
[00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:28.845]  Lernger said, with a third of Americans voting on new equipment, again as I said about 35%, and voters navigating new registration databases and changing ID rules, election watchdogs worried about polling problems even before the voting began Tuesday.
[00:27:29.688 --> 00:27:38.514]  Although turnout is generally lower in midterm elections, this year was the deadline for many of the election changes enacted in the wake of the Florida balloting chaos of 2000.
[00:27:38.554 --> 00:27:40.476]  Yeah, that wasn't chaos.
[00:27:40.496 --> 00:27:41.636]  That was election theft.
[00:27:41.656 --> 00:27:43.077]  That was scams going on.
[00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:45.679]  And then they claimed, oh, it's the butterfly ballots.
[00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:48.441]  But it was in precincts that didn't have that in Florida and other areas.
[00:27:48.741 --> 00:27:53.645]  And we saw the same thing in 2004 in Ohio and New Mexico and other key battleground states.
[00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:59.970]  And these malfunctions are taking place in key battleground states right now.
[00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:05.274]  It is so transparent, it is so incredibly obvious.
[00:28:05.314 --> 00:28:11.819]  Now, if you go to GOP.org website, we have links to up on our websites,
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:18.523]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, and all of them have different election coverage.
[00:28:18.543 --> 00:28:21.185]  Some of them have the same stories, but I've got different people working on it.
[00:28:21.485 --> 00:28:28.009]  There's so many news articles at different sites of different stories, so to get a full picture, look at them all today, and other sites as well.
[00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:30.370]  Beware of exit polls.
[00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.592]  This is what the Republicans are saying in a press release this morning.
[00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:40.136]  Biased and inaccurate predictions have led to poor GOP exit poll showings in the past three national elections.
[00:28:40.822 --> 00:28:47.385]  And again, exit polls were always seen as extremely accurate until the new magic machine started going in in the last three elections.
[00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:52.047]  And so, oh, suddenly, suddenly, oh, those are wrong!
[00:28:52.087 --> 00:28:55.809]  It shows the Democrat 1 by 10 points, but the machine doesn't say so.
[00:28:56.809 --> 00:29:00.051]  And they go on to say, fast facts on exit polling.
[00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:01.812]  So this is their spin.
[00:29:02.272 --> 00:29:07.835]  Don't believe the exit polls, which have always mirrored the scientific polls, that have always been trustworthy.
[00:29:08.115 --> 00:29:16.959]  But now suddenly the rules of the election process showing that exit polls and scientific polls are very accurate, down to just a few percentage points, that's all thrown out.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.582]  Does it matter if polls show a Democrat's going to win by 10, 12, 15 or more points?
[00:29:23.022 --> 00:29:24.483]  The machines do the voting.
[00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:26.524]  It takes all the trouble away.
[00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:35.365]  National exit polls will skew in favor of Democrats this year due to large numbers of uncontested Democratic seats in the House of Representatives, the Republicans say.
[00:29:35.805 --> 00:29:36.906]  We'll tell you more about this.
[00:29:36.926 --> 00:29:44.171]  We'll try to get a report here from Austin with the local vote rescue folks.
[00:29:44.671 --> 00:29:45.872]  We've got Ben Harris coming up.
[00:29:45.892 --> 00:29:47.133]  We've got Michael Rivero coming up.
[00:29:47.193 --> 00:29:48.594]  And we've got your calls coming up.
[00:29:48.854 --> 00:29:49.355]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:52.877]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:54.859]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:58.636]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.497 --> 00:30:04.919]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:08.741]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:12.042]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:12.322 --> 00:30:18.706]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.786 --> 00:30:23.188]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:23.408 --> 00:30:27.772]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:27.932 --> 00:30:30.554]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:30.574 --> 00:30:33.337]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.797 --> 00:30:36.339]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:40.643]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:40.703 --> 00:30:41.524]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.824 --> 00:30:46.447]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:46.627 --> 00:30:48.268]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:48.288 --> 00:30:50.470]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:31:01.764 --> 00:31:05.328]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.368 --> 00:31:05.889]  are located?
[00:31:06.089 --> 00:31:09.474]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.694 --> 00:31:14.420]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.707]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:20.307]  We're good to
[00:31:39.594 --> 00:31:44.135]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:31:44.155 --> 00:31:46.356]  Globalists are concerned with what's good
[00:32:14.858 --> 00:32:15.278]  We're good.
[00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:32.047]  I think so.
[00:33:27.054 --> 00:33:44.692]  Whether you live in Oregon, Texas, New York, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, all points in between, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming,
[00:33:46.582 --> 00:33:47.503]  I want to hear from you.
[00:33:47.523 --> 00:33:50.085]  I want to know what your local papers are reporting.
[00:33:50.246 --> 00:33:55.851]  Every county, every city, every major city I look at, every state I look at is having, quote, problems.
[00:33:55.891 --> 00:33:58.053]  The machines aren't working, they're crashing, they're flipping.
[00:33:58.774 --> 00:34:04.179]  But in key battleground states is where we see, I would say, 80 plus percent of it centering.
[00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:07.502]  And that's what you'd expect with fraud.
[00:34:09.275 --> 00:34:12.517]  And we have been talking to local vote rescue Vicki Karp.
[00:34:13.037 --> 00:34:14.338]  We talked to her about 30 minutes ago now.
[00:34:14.358 --> 00:34:15.418]  We're unable to get in touch with her.
[00:34:15.438 --> 00:34:17.860]  As soon as she is done, she's a local realtor.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.920]  She may be busy doing that.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.281]  I doubt she's working today.
[00:34:21.121 --> 00:34:23.302]  I know she's out there running the vote rescue operation.
[00:34:23.683 --> 00:34:26.324]  As soon as she can, I'm sure she's putting in an actual report right now.
[00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.345]  She works with Bev Harris and many others.
[00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:31.367]  The Brad Blog and others that are really leaders in tracking all of this.
[00:34:31.747 --> 00:34:35.449]  As soon as she's able, I'd like her to call the back line or maybe she was given the wrong back line.
[00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.650]  We gave her the back line and she never called in.
[00:34:39.364 --> 00:34:43.225]  So I'd ask her to call my office and get that back line again if she's having problems.
[00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:45.766]  Let's do this.
[00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:49.347]  Let's go to your calls, and then I'm going to recap.
[00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:53.028]  The Republicans are saying in a press release, don't trust the exit polls!
[00:34:53.408 --> 00:34:55.148]  And don't trust scientific polls!
[00:34:55.648 --> 00:35:00.210]  Does it matter if everybody says they're voting for Democrats, the third party, or other candidates, or anti-incumbents?
[00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.270]  We're really winning!
[00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:02.830]  We're winning!
[00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.351]  The machines are coming through for us!
[00:35:06.824 --> 00:35:17.755]  It's like in New Hampshire and other key battleground states, the polls showed more than 10% lead for the more anti-establishment candidate.
[00:35:20.057 --> 00:35:23.040]  I was thinking he's still establishment, but they certainly didn't like him.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.904]  Howard Dean, who could have really gone up against Bush.
[00:35:27.384 --> 00:35:31.088]  And then magically, everywhere Diebold was in place in those key New England states,
[00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:38.505]  Everywhere that it was being used, it had Kerry winning by about 3 or 4 points in the Democratic primary in 2004.
[00:35:39.826 --> 00:35:40.366]  Remember that?
[00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:43.527]  And everywhere it wasn't in place, well, guess what?
[00:35:44.067 --> 00:35:51.730]  The poll numbers matched the exit polls, and the poll numbers matched the scientific polls, showing that Dean was leading by about 10 points.
[00:35:52.991 --> 00:35:53.611]  Remember that?
[00:35:55.063 --> 00:35:55.483]  You see?
[00:35:55.884 --> 00:35:57.765]  There's so many levels of fraud to this.
[00:35:57.785 --> 00:35:59.126]  And then, of course, Kerry took a dive.
[00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:09.752]  You can't just steal the election because the person you're running against could contest it if it's a real person, a real candidate, like in Mexico, and you end up with burning police stations and bombs going off.
[00:36:10.132 --> 00:36:15.475]  Now they're several months into civil war in many areas of Mexico.
[00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.198]  Let's go to the calls right now.
[00:36:19.258 --> 00:36:22.199]  Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Florida.
[00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:22.940]  Patrick, welcome.
[00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.411]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:24.891]  Hello.
[00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:26.453]  I'm here in Central Florida.
[00:36:26.493 --> 00:36:28.235]  We had paper ballots, believe it or not.
[00:36:28.255 --> 00:36:38.425]  I held my nose and voted for some of the third party and or non-incumbents who are probably socialists as well, but just trying to shake things up a bit.
[00:36:40.307 --> 00:36:46.153]  But I also wanted to bring up one thing as far as a social security number for babies.
[00:36:48.364 --> 00:36:48.824]  I tried.
[00:36:49.104 --> 00:36:50.685]  Didn't get a social security number.
[00:36:50.745 --> 00:36:54.487]  The nurses at the hospital looked at me like I was Hitler.
[00:36:55.948 --> 00:36:56.949]  Plus, I didn't get any vaccine.
[00:36:56.989 --> 00:36:59.390]  But just a few years ago, they didn't push you to get it.
[00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.653]  You didn't get a social security number until you got a job when you were 14 years old, like I read.
[00:37:04.173 --> 00:37:05.334]  But not anymore.
[00:37:05.734 --> 00:37:08.635]  And they look at you like you're a space alien if you don't want shots either.
[00:37:09.076 --> 00:37:09.416]  Correct.
[00:37:09.556 --> 00:37:13.698]  And, you know, I told them, look, my baby doesn't even have a wallet yet.
[00:37:13.758 --> 00:37:15.219]  Why does he need a social security number?
[00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:16.260]  But here's the problem.
[00:37:17.173 --> 00:37:23.194]  I can't claim him as a tax deduction, and they say, unless I have a social security number, and that's news to me.
[00:37:23.214 --> 00:37:24.955]  Yeah, it'll cost you a couple thousand dollars.
[00:37:25.195 --> 00:37:28.235]  Yeah, it cost me $1,700 last year.
[00:37:28.835 --> 00:37:33.596]  Do you know of any way I can get around it by sending them birth certificates or whatever?
[00:37:33.796 --> 00:37:34.437]  They don't care.
[00:37:34.497 --> 00:37:36.997]  They want to make sure your child is pledged.
[00:37:37.457 --> 00:37:38.437]  This isn't an urban legend.
[00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:40.158]  We had Joseph Stiklis on and he discussed it.
[00:37:40.638 --> 00:37:45.739]  The resources, the people, it's what we call human resources, are pledged to the debt as chattel.
[00:37:46.497 --> 00:38:00.107]  And so they take that birth certificate that they already have, and they tie it into the health departments, and they have an illegal DNA database for the last 34 years of everybody born in a hospital, and the quote, blood tests they give, and that's been admitted.
[00:38:00.127 --> 00:38:06.892]  I've had congressmen on to talk about the DNA databases in North Carolina and Michigan, or two of the big ones, the federal databases.
[00:38:08.013 --> 00:38:12.636]  And I don't know of a way to do that, sir, but the income tax itself is a fraudulent
[00:38:13.214 --> 00:38:19.783]  Yes, I understand that, but you know, the social security numbers, okay, just like the vaccinations, they claim that by law you have to get them, which is a lie.
[00:38:29.966 --> 00:38:48.494]  But, you know, it's not by law you have to get a social security number, so why do you have to have it to claim... And under federal law, under the 1986 Privacy Act, it is only to be used in the administration of the Social Security Act and the Social Security Program.
[00:38:48.894 --> 00:38:56.978]  But you notice they demand it when you buy a car, they demand it when you do any banking, they demand it illegally everywhere.
[00:38:57.618 --> 00:39:05.806]  Well, you know, I just wanted to get your thoughts on that, Alex, because, you know, everywhere Americans are just, you know, they're bootlicking.
[00:39:05.886 --> 00:39:08.048]  You know, anything the government says, I'm going to do.
[00:39:08.168 --> 00:39:10.631]  Let me just say, if you're worried about a Social Security brother,
[00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:37.411]  number you better worry about your cell phone tracks you if they use computers to listen to you all the new computers listen to you Google admits they're using the microphones and cameras to watch you yes I'm not kidding folks I mean so the surveillance is so past that now it's even it just it's mind-blowing well thanks for your time today Alex I'll let other callers get through yeah I appreciate your call let's go ahead and take another call here let's
[00:39:39.426 --> 00:39:40.627]  Talk to Edward in Florida.
[00:39:40.707 --> 00:39:42.308]  Edward, another call from Florida.
[00:39:42.928 --> 00:39:43.408]  Hey Alex.
[00:39:43.768 --> 00:39:44.629]  Hi.
[00:39:45.489 --> 00:39:50.812]  Yeah, I've watched a couple of these documentaries lately and I'm just so sad for this country.
[00:39:52.313 --> 00:39:57.336]  Anyway, down here in Florida, it looks like we've got some voting machine frustrations.
[00:39:57.816 --> 00:40:06.941]  At Precinct 2002 in West Palm Beach, a couple voters hit one candidate and another candidate's name was checked off.
[00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:10.622]  If you go to palmbeachpost.com, there's a couple of stories.
[00:40:10.682 --> 00:40:13.224]  Exactly, palmbeachpost.com.
[00:40:13.264 --> 00:40:14.466]  I saw that we're going to be on that.
[00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:16.968]  I believe that's already posted on prisonplanet.com.
[00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:19.611]  And exactly, quote, malfunctions.
[00:40:20.592 --> 00:40:28.479]  But notice, I've been looking at it, it's the establishment candidates, it's the incumbents, it's the neocons, and close races.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.442]  Magically, it's flipping the vote.
[00:40:31.943 --> 00:40:32.003]  Oh!
[00:40:32.543 --> 00:40:38.568]  Yeah, and you know, Katherine Harris doesn't stand a chance against Bill Nelson, who's, I mean, he might as well be a Republican.
[00:40:38.808 --> 00:40:38.888]  Ugh.
[00:40:39.609 --> 00:40:45.253]  But look, I just wanted to take a moment to encourage that guy, Troy, that called in yesterday to disagree, you know.
[00:40:45.273 --> 00:40:51.558]  I just want to encourage him to go to PrisonPlanet.com and read through all the data pages that you have on there.
[00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:53.540]  Just, you know, research.
[00:40:54.241 --> 00:40:57.463]  Ignorance may be bliss, but knowledge will definitely set us free.
[00:40:57.583 --> 00:41:02.067]  And it's encouraging to see that he's at least calling into your show and listening to your show.
[00:41:02.748 --> 00:41:06.930]  And, you know, I wish half these neocons would do the same thing.
[00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:14.615]  And also, just real quick, everybody out there, get healthy, start exercising, eat good foods, because this is it, guys.
[00:41:16.876 --> 00:41:19.637]  You know, I'm going to a gun show later on this week.
[00:41:19.657 --> 00:41:20.938]  I'm going to get armed.
[00:41:22.439 --> 00:41:24.060]  You know, I'm ready to defend my republic.
[00:41:24.901 --> 00:41:25.401]  Absolutely.
[00:41:25.682 --> 00:41:28.024]  Well, buying a gun is half of it.
[00:41:28.044 --> 00:41:29.005]  You need to go out and shoot it.
[00:41:29.305 --> 00:41:30.126]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:41:30.166 --> 00:41:31.647]  All of us need to get out.
[00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:41.095]  I've been so busy the last few years, I never have a chance to go shooting or hunting, and my skills have dropped from just absolutely superb, as good as it gets, down to just good.
[00:41:41.115 --> 00:41:43.877]  And I'm very upset about it, so I'm going to be doing some more shooting.
[00:41:44.478 --> 00:41:45.078]  Yeah, me too.
[00:41:45.218 --> 00:41:47.761]  And, you know, I was a big liberal Air America listener.
[00:41:48.221 --> 00:41:51.504]  I called in and asked Mike Malloy what he thought about the Democrats winning.
[00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.651]  And he's a lot more optimistic than I am, that's for sure.
[00:41:55.011 --> 00:41:55.912]  But not anymore.
[00:41:55.932 --> 00:41:58.513]  I mean, I'm pro-Second Amendment now.
[00:41:58.533 --> 00:41:59.693]  I mean, get out there, guys.
[00:41:59.753 --> 00:42:00.354]  Get healthy.
[00:42:01.194 --> 00:42:08.277]  These people that we're up against, you know, these are Army guys that have full, you know, combat armor on.
[00:42:09.638 --> 00:42:10.518]  You know, just get ready.
[00:42:11.178 --> 00:42:11.519]  Get ready.
[00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.039]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.021]  You know, this is what this broadcast has been able to do.
[00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:21.083]  And of course, others get credit as well, but I'm really proud of the work we've done.
[00:42:21.915 --> 00:42:32.817]  Imagine Democrats, over the last 20 years, who were aware of the corruption of the Republican Party, and they would hear Republicans run around and defend it and lie about the corruption and say it didn't exist.
[00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:40.079]  And so, they bought into the Democratic Party and thought, yeah, you don't need a gun, it's violent, it's bad, it hurts the children.
[00:42:41.419 --> 00:42:45.920]  But what's happened is, real conservatives, real libertarians, real truth seekers,
[00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:50.609]  Have illustrated, hey, they're building FEMA camps.
[00:42:50.989 --> 00:42:52.750]  Hey, they're shutting up the dictatorship.
[00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.851]  They're militarizing the police.
[00:42:55.212 --> 00:42:56.653]  They're abolishing the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:56.693 --> 00:42:58.554]  They're saying they'll use the army against us.
[00:42:59.414 --> 00:43:02.757]  Now do you understand, liberals, why we need guns?
[00:43:03.517 --> 00:43:05.458]  And they're not even what you'd call a liberal anymore.
[00:43:05.498 --> 00:43:07.380]  They're going, yes, both parties are controlled.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.601]  Yes, we need to buy guns.
[00:43:10.223 --> 00:43:11.384]  Yes, we need to get ready.
[00:43:11.824 --> 00:43:14.685]  Yes, we understand communism was created by the big banks.
[00:43:15.566 --> 00:43:25.311]  I'm telling you, I'm really proud of what you'd call liberals, because they wouldn't wake up to Bill Clinton's crimes, they couldn't believe it, but over time, they did wake up.
[00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:29.613]  And conservatives, to some extent, have woken up to the fact that Bush is a phony.
[00:43:30.293 --> 00:43:33.995]  I mean, when another 10 or 15 top preachers and top Republicans, it turns out,
[00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:39.353]  You know, or gay, or pedophiles, or into drugs.
[00:43:39.873 --> 00:43:42.155]  I mean, you're going to find out that it's actually a guild.
[00:43:42.215 --> 00:43:42.895]  It's a club.
[00:43:42.955 --> 00:43:45.417]  You have to be into that to even join the club.
[00:43:45.437 --> 00:43:47.358]  How many years have I been saying that?
[00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:51.221]  What's happening is the liberals are now learning about this.
[00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:52.802]  And they're not liberals.
[00:43:52.842 --> 00:43:54.082]  They're now just Americans.
[00:43:54.102 --> 00:43:55.223]  They're constitutionalists.
[00:43:55.303 --> 00:43:58.806]  And they now realize, oh, I see what the Second Amendment's about.
[00:43:59.686 --> 00:44:00.807]  I understand now.
[00:44:01.787 --> 00:44:06.210]  And every liberal I know has bought assault rifles, handguns, shotguns.
[00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.671]  They're out shooting them.
[00:44:08.491 --> 00:44:08.971]  And they're ready.
[00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:10.132]  They're not going to a FEMA camp.
[00:44:11.213 --> 00:44:12.894]  And by the way, I want to tell the liberals, don't worry.
[00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:19.257]  Most of the troops, especially the older ones, the young gang member types who like to just kill people, they're going to be cops.
[00:44:19.297 --> 00:44:25.081]  But you've got to understand that a lot of them are just going to go work in business or at the car dealership.
[00:44:25.856 --> 00:44:26.556]  You know, wherever.
[00:44:27.096 --> 00:44:29.557]  And they know exactly what's going on.
[00:44:29.697 --> 00:44:38.119]  And let me just tell you, there are special forces, former special forces, not just troops, but not just regular military, all over the country, just waiting.
[00:44:39.019 --> 00:44:40.979]  Waiting for military to come down their street.
[00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:42.800]  Waiting for people to try to take their guns.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.320]  I mean, folks, there are bunkers built everywhere.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:50.501]  There are militias, the smart ones that are quiet and aren't infiltrated everywhere.
[00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.862]  I mean, we are an armed camp.
[00:44:54.142 --> 00:44:59.066]  And I just feel sorry for any military units or any police units that try anything.
[00:44:59.086 --> 00:45:01.948]  I mean, you'll be completely destroyed.
[00:45:02.768 --> 00:45:04.129]  And I think you know that, don't you?
[00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:08.592]  So if you think you're going to... That's why they're acing the whole of those 30 million illegal aliens.
[00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:13.796]  The globalists, if a rebellion kicks off, they will give the orders through their capos
[00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:18.847]  through the leftist organizations controlled by the Ford Foundation to torch every U.S.
[00:45:18.907 --> 00:45:19.207]  city.
[00:45:19.707 --> 00:45:25.230]  Then conservatives and liberals alike will see that and will stand down when the military occupies.
[00:45:27.351 --> 00:45:28.171]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:45:28.251 --> 00:45:34.213]  When the military then goes into phase two of gun confiscation, it's kind of like Katrina.
[00:45:34.354 --> 00:45:40.016]  They on purpose locked down the city, wouldn't let people escape, blocked the firemen and police and good police and military.
[00:45:41.036 --> 00:45:44.001]  Early on State Guard from coming in to aid.
[00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.525]  They jammed the police communications as the storm hit.
[00:45:46.806 --> 00:45:48.348]  Cut down their communications lines.
[00:45:48.468 --> 00:45:52.415]  Police are on records and they had to guard them with armed troops because of FEMA.
[00:45:56.661 --> 00:46:03.324]  You know, even there, that was a microcosm laboratory test of, okay, well, if we say it's an emergency, will they accept gun confiscation?
[00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:05.565]  And gun owners at first couldn't believe it.
[00:46:05.585 --> 00:46:13.529]  When it was in the New York Times, New York Times reporting happily that all guns were to be turned in in the entire area of Louisiana, and the gun confiscation crews were coming.
[00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:14.950]  Food and water wasn't being delivered.
[00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.171]  No, no, no, no.
[00:46:16.491 --> 00:46:23.014]  Flatback trucks with FBI SWAT teams leading hordes of regular Army and local police were coming.
[00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:30.750]  And people saw those images of old women being drugged out and rich people's houses being drugged out and... I just... Shame on you.
[00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.550]  Shame on you.
[00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.951]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Connecticut, then Brett and others.
[00:46:34.991 --> 00:46:35.551]  Go ahead, Eric.
[00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:36.451]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:36.471 --> 00:46:37.372]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:46:37.512 --> 00:46:37.752]  Hi.
[00:46:38.192 --> 00:46:42.653]  My next letter is going to be, um, exhorting people to watch Freedom to Fascism.
[00:46:43.453 --> 00:46:46.734]  I'm also trying to get my local theater to play that and Terror Storm.
[00:46:47.194 --> 00:46:49.115]  By your next letter, what, do you write letters to the editor?
[00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:49.675]  Yes.
[00:46:50.235 --> 00:46:52.296]  I wrote... I read you a letter from, uh, last month.
[00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:52.836]  That's right.
[00:46:52.856 --> 00:46:53.236]  I remember.
[00:46:54.036 --> 00:46:55.117]  I have two questions, Alex.
[00:46:55.697 --> 00:47:04.401]  The first one is, have there been any latest developments on the matter regarding Ron Paul and the NRA treachery, and your take on that, your further take on the NRA treachery?
[00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:11.964]  And also, I'm reading a book by Bill Cooper named Behold a Pale Horse, and there's a section in there that's entitled, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[00:47:12.164 --> 00:47:13.425]  Was that a legitimate document?
[00:47:13.805 --> 00:47:16.266]  Oh yeah, that's a public document by Colonel Alexander.
[00:47:16.927 --> 00:47:17.547]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:47:17.587 --> 00:47:19.948]  I read that and I was doing a slow burn and I'm thinking,
[00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:23.107]  This is what these inbred cockroaches think of us.
[00:47:23.147 --> 00:47:23.547]  That's right.
[00:47:23.627 --> 00:47:26.848]  Huge microwave guns mounted on police armored vehicles frying us.
[00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:28.569]  Huge sound cannons everywhere.
[00:47:28.649 --> 00:47:29.529]  Total surveillance.
[00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.769]  The cities as surveillance grids.
[00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.290]  Huge open prisons.
[00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.131]  They refer to us as cattle, Alex.
[00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:39.692]  And they also say that the lower classes, us cattle basically,
[00:47:40.233 --> 00:47:46.257]  We have to be subjected to an inferior education because we're not smart enough to be the elite.
[00:47:46.278 --> 00:47:47.458]  No, no, that's real.
[00:47:48.059 --> 00:47:50.561]  He just wrote about it before it was declassified.
[00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:52.282]  Also, wasn't he murdered?
[00:47:52.742 --> 00:47:54.444]  Yes, he was gunned down by a SWAT team.
[00:47:55.945 --> 00:47:57.766]  Well, I'll just leave it at this, Alex.
[00:47:57.906 --> 00:48:02.049]  I'm going to keep an eye on my local elections and this whole matter with the NRA and Ron Paul.
[00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.091]  I am ashamed of the NRA.
[00:48:05.288 --> 00:48:07.312]  Absolutely and completely ashamed of that.
[00:48:07.332 --> 00:48:18.912]  For those who don't know, they endorsed the Democratic candidate, a big implantable animal ID activist, pro toll roads, pro NAFTA highway activist, absolute sniveling worm.
[00:48:19.845 --> 00:48:28.170]  And they said that Ron Paul is anti-gun and endorsed the other candidate when Ron Paul is an A-plus by every other gun group, state and national.
[00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.352]  And it has the best voting record period of any congressman.
[00:48:31.692 --> 00:48:32.592]  And that's how they play.
[00:48:32.612 --> 00:48:33.573]  They play hardball.
[00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:38.316]  It could be safely said, Alex, that the NRA is the nation's largest gun control organization.
[00:48:38.496 --> 00:48:40.677]  They got the 68 Gun Control Act passed.
[00:48:41.037 --> 00:48:41.597]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:48:41.757 --> 00:48:42.058]  Thank you.
[00:48:42.078 --> 00:48:43.098]  And I like Charlton Heston.
[00:48:43.118 --> 00:48:46.000]  You know, I've interviewed him before he retired from Alzheimer's.
[00:48:47.232 --> 00:48:51.635]  But did you know I have the video tape somewhere around here where he campaigned for the 1968 Gun Control Act?
[00:48:52.636 --> 00:48:56.338]  And I do have him on record saying we should, you know, restrict people having semi-autos.
[00:48:56.418 --> 00:48:59.720]  So, again, they come as a man of peace.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.321]  They come as the good guy.
[00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:03.562]  They come... It's sick.
[00:49:04.743 --> 00:49:06.224]  Wolves in sheep's clothing is what it's called.
[00:49:06.904 --> 00:49:09.706]  Of course, you can believe the facts or you can give up your guns.
[00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:13.108]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brett.
[00:49:13.148 --> 00:49:14.029]  Brett, where are you calling us from?
[00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:15.807]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:16.108 --> 00:49:18.289]  I'm calling from Delaware County, Indiana.
[00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:20.831]  It seems we made national headlines today.
[00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:22.892]  That's right, with all the machine problems.
[00:49:23.053 --> 00:49:24.994]  Yeah, I just want to give a couple reports.
[00:49:25.014 --> 00:49:27.396]  A lot of people were turned away.
[00:49:27.616 --> 00:49:31.298]  They were told that the machines were down and they were out of the paper ballots also.
[00:49:32.639 --> 00:49:40.565]  And the judge here did rule that the polls could stay open an extra two hours and 40 minutes to make up for that lost time this morning.
[00:49:42.142 --> 00:49:46.109]  Meanwhile, the media is telling us, oh, we'll tell you the national results early.
[00:49:46.129 --> 00:49:48.172]  But we'll know by 6 o'clock tonight.
[00:49:48.293 --> 00:49:49.174]  Bull, they will.
[00:49:49.475 --> 00:49:52.580]  Yeah, I guess people in Indianapolis told him he couldn't do it.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.485]  He said that he was the judge and he could do whatever he wants.
[00:49:57.725 --> 00:49:58.785]  Well, this is what they do.
[00:49:58.825 --> 00:50:00.306]  In every election now, they tell you about 6, 7.
[00:50:01.146 --> 00:50:02.567]  Okay, Republicans won.
[00:50:02.927 --> 00:50:03.667]  Go back to sleep.
[00:50:03.687 --> 00:50:07.909]  Don't bother voting on the West Coast when it's 4 o'clock, when everybody can still go vote.
[00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:12.110]  They just hear, oh, it's already decided, and everybody goes to sleep.
[00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:19.213]  Yeah, I'm sure a lot of people won't know that they were turned away this morning that the polls will stay open later, so they probably just won't even bother voting.
[00:50:19.693 --> 00:50:23.014]  And there'll be big lines 10 times worse at 5, 6 o'clock at night.
[00:50:23.584 --> 00:50:28.346]  Yeah, and probably what happened in Ohio, and people won't get the vote at all.
[00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:34.869]  Well, you know, the big report here, and I do have it here in the Palm Beach Post and other publications, is they're flipping the votes.
[00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:44.092]  He wrote for the Democrat, and they say, uh-uh, Diebold, Hardener Civics, ES&S, Sequoia, we're gonna make that vote for you.
[00:50:44.132 --> 00:50:44.773]  How's that sound?
[00:50:45.073 --> 00:50:49.014]  If you don't like it, we'll call in some cops, billy clubs, to knock your teeth out.
[00:50:49.315 --> 00:50:50.175]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.892 --> 00:51:05.297]  It's here!
[00:51:05.497 --> 00:51:10.261]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.642 --> 00:51:18.248]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.962 --> 00:51:26.025]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.405 --> 00:51:37.809]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.149 --> 00:51:42.091]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.111 --> 00:51:44.031]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:48.153]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.083 --> 00:52:04.124]  The war on terrorism.
[00:52:04.444 --> 00:52:07.226]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:07.506 --> 00:52:11.648]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.909]  So what do you do?
[00:52:13.229 --> 00:52:17.792]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:18.274 --> 00:52:20.395]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:20.895 --> 00:52:35.581]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:54:23.099 --> 00:54:25.361]  We went to number 9 over the weekend.
[00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:28.703]  I want to push TerrorStorm to number 1 on the Amazon charts.
[00:54:29.023 --> 00:54:31.685]  The number 1 indicator used around the country.

[00:55:13.284 --> 00:55:16.286]  By the way, I learned that they've aired C-SPAN two more times.
[00:55:17.227 --> 00:55:17.847]  I didn't know that.
[00:55:17.968 --> 00:55:19.008]  Six times they've aired that.
[00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:24.152]  The most requested, most watched C-SPAN program in history, C-SPAN has reported.
[00:55:24.844 --> 00:55:26.965]  So, the highlights of that are on the film as well.
[00:55:27.005 --> 00:55:27.866]  Please get Terrorist Form today.
[00:55:27.926 --> 00:55:37.190]  I'm going to have her with us in this segment and the next, and Michael Rivero joins us, and Beth Harris in the third hour with the big HBO films and in shockwaves across the country, Hacking Democracy.
[00:55:37.691 --> 00:55:46.035]  But right now, we are joined by the editor of the book, she also wrote some of the sections in it, Hacked!
[00:55:46.095 --> 00:55:47.456]  High Tech Election Theft in America.
[00:55:47.876 --> 00:55:53.819]  She runs the local group here, Vote Rescue, she's Vicky Karp.
[00:55:55.129 --> 00:55:58.292]  And Vicki, when we were trying to get her on about 30 minutes ago, was in there voting.
[00:55:58.312 --> 00:55:58.953]  She just got out.
[00:55:58.973 --> 00:55:59.693]  She's in her car.
[00:55:59.833 --> 00:56:08.241]  Vicki, we've got reports from Vote Rescue coming in right now from three separate precincts, three separate problems from some of your sources.
[00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:11.484]  Tell us about what's happening in Travis County, where Austin resides.
[00:56:12.565 --> 00:56:14.286]  Okay, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[00:56:14.327 --> 00:56:21.353]  Well, at Precinct 364 in the Westlake area, Valley View Elementary School, they had machines breaking down and they were asking voters
[00:56:21.946 --> 00:56:23.727]  To vote on the sample ballots.
[00:56:24.027 --> 00:56:27.549]  Not sure how that's working out, but we're trying to send crews over there to investigate.
[00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:38.996]  Then at the Pan Am Rec Center on East 3rd Street, we have our parallel election team over there, and the power went out over there, which means the machines are just down.
[00:56:40.577 --> 00:56:41.097]  Completely.
[00:56:41.137 --> 00:56:42.578]  I don't know how long that's going to last.
[00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:47.621]  And then we had one report from Williamson County where their wrong ballot was being
[00:56:48.314 --> 00:57:09.322]  I'm not sure if it was being given to people by hand, I don't know which systems they're voting on in that section of Williamson County, or if it's the wrong ballot coming up on the machine, which is what we, you know, we have ballots coming up on the screen here in Travis County, so we're trying to find out what's going on there, but our vote rescue rep in Cedar Park, Joe Rogers, called the Secretary of State's office and they said, well, we can't help you
[00:57:09.775 --> 00:57:14.498]  You need to call the county and they're trying to call Williamson County Election Office and no one's answering over there.
[00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:19.141]  So we don't need to go to San Antonio where they're flipping votes, that's even been in the newspaper.
[00:57:19.461 --> 00:57:23.744]  We don't need to go to Austin where they've been flipping them in the last few weeks, though we're in Austin.
[00:57:24.084 --> 00:57:28.928]  We're seeing right now, here in Central Texas, every type of problem you can imagine.
[00:57:29.748 --> 00:57:31.870]  Oh, my phone is ringing off the hook.
[00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:34.311]  I just, I mean, I have 12 calls backed up.
[00:57:34.371 --> 00:57:36.813]  I'm sure I'll have more for you later if you want me to call back.
[00:57:38.162 --> 00:57:50.450]  Jeff Kantoff called in and said he asked for a paper ballot and they're supposed to have paper ballots... And Jeff Kantoff works with me on the TV show, good friend, very, very neurotic about being exactly accurate, so he's a great source.
[00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.051]  What did Jeff Kantoff tell you?
[00:57:52.632 --> 00:58:01.538]  Well, he said that he asked for a paper ballot to vote on and they only allow those for emergencies if the machines are going down and the machines were not down where he was voting, so they refused to give him one.
[00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:08.639]  And he said that they offered him the ability to file a complaint with the Secretary of State's office in writing.
[00:58:08.939 --> 00:58:15.929]  I think they had a form for that, so he said for me to mention that when I could and ask people to do that if they had a few minutes to fill out that form.
[00:58:15.949 --> 00:58:18.773]  Yeah, they need to get thousands of reports complaining.
[00:58:19.568 --> 00:58:20.349]  Right, exactly.
[00:58:20.369 --> 00:58:22.950]  So we can show that the people don't like these machines.
[00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.671]  Of course, the polls show that too.
[00:58:24.711 --> 00:58:26.613]  Vicki Carver, I've got a few more questions for you.
[00:58:27.193 --> 00:58:29.415]  Hold there one minute while we start the second hour.
[00:58:29.935 --> 00:58:32.977]  Then Michael Rivero joins us and we're going to get to your calls as well.
[00:58:33.137 --> 00:58:35.919]  Alex and Rob and Robert and Joe and many others.
[00:58:36.759 --> 00:58:39.541]  A massive election coverage of the election fraud.
[00:58:39.581 --> 00:58:40.522]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.943 --> 00:58:46.165]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.546 --> 00:58:58.188]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:59.933]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.635 --> 00:59:01.759]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.421 --> 00:59:03.183]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.974 --> 00:59:04.835]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.515 --> 00:59:09.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.717 --> 00:59:13.799]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:38.713]  Continual national coverage of the 2006 New World Order stolen election this morning.
[00:59:38.733 --> 00:59:42.054]  I spent a full hour looking at the different national maps.
[00:59:42.095 --> 00:59:54.580]  Some of them vary a little bit, but they agree predominantly that the Republicans, according to scientific polls, will lose at least 17 House seats and probably 2 to 4, depending on the analysis you look at.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.621]  This is even by people like Robert Novak, who's pretty darn good at it.
[00:59:57.641 --> 00:59:59.242]  He's a big Republican, big neocon.
[01:00:00.903 --> 01:00:03.105]  17 House, 2-4 Senate seats.
[01:00:03.586 --> 01:00:15.020]  And if you look at the maps, the Wall Street Journal and CNN and others have of contested races, you notice that that's where the vote flipping, the machine crashing, the machine shutdowns are happening.
[01:00:15.781 --> 01:00:18.084]  It's happening from Palm Beach,
[01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:22.507]  Florida to Austin, Texas to Ohio.
[01:00:22.527 --> 01:00:23.668]  It's just happening everywhere.
[01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:29.214]  And we've got Bev Harris coming up in the third hour with about the big HBO special, Hacking Democracy.
[01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:31.617]  We've got Michael Rivera with his analysis joining us in a few minutes.
[01:00:31.637 --> 01:00:37.503]  We'll open phones with your reports of election fraud and quote problems in every contested area.
[01:00:37.543 --> 01:00:39.865]  Of course, it's mainly popping up there, very obvious.
[01:00:40.626 --> 01:00:41.147]  But right now,
[01:00:42.012 --> 01:00:56.758]  The head of Vote Rescue right here in Austin, Texas, Vicky Karp, who for the last 3-4 years has really been making big inroads, exposing the fraudulent nature of the electronic, no-paper ballot systems, getting reports of big problems pouring in.
[01:00:57.298 --> 01:01:05.861]  Yeah, Vicky, please, I know as we talk to you, you're getting dozens of calls, as you said, from your poll watchers and people out there reporting problems.
[01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:15.508]  Evie Wood, check in with us at the end of this hour and the end of the next hour with little five-minute reports of, just as a microcosm, what's happening here in Austin, Texas in Travis County.
[01:01:16.428 --> 01:01:17.029]  That would be great.
[01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.609]  I'd love to.
[01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:26.155]  I want to caution voters against voting a straight party ticket because there are manipulations that tend to occur or have occurred in the past with these hard-ender civic machines.
[01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:31.819]  In the presidential election, strangely enough, only one vote flipped and that was from Kerry to Bush.
[01:01:32.478 --> 01:01:34.279]  When people try to vote a straight Democratic ticket.
[01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:39.662]  That's right, they go into the box and in fact from the research they found that's what some of the other companies do.
[01:01:39.682 --> 01:01:48.946]  The quote, hack malfunction is it takes the straight party ticket and flips that so you're giving them those numbers of votes a grouping to do that with.
[01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:56.390]  Exactly and a lot of people don't go back and properly check their ballot before they hit that cast ballot button and that's where we lose votes that way.
[01:01:57.012 --> 01:02:01.354]  And yeah, I'm looking at some reports that have come in from around the country, too.
[01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:03.114]  I've got a couple of good ones, just real quick.
[01:02:03.134 --> 01:02:04.815]  A couple of headlines from Bradblog.
[01:02:05.435 --> 01:02:10.897]  San Diego County Registrar Assigns High School Students as Touchscreen Inspectors.
[01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:11.597]  That's one.
[01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:13.889]  And here's another good one.
[01:02:13.969 --> 01:02:17.751]  Florida candidate finds unattended voting machines in Pinellas County.
[01:02:18.891 --> 01:02:23.293]  And then reports of massive vote flipping from Democrat to Republican.
[01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:26.715]  I think that's somewhere in California on a radio station was reporting.
[01:02:26.755 --> 01:02:28.476]  I don't know the exact location.
[01:02:28.656 --> 01:02:33.719]  What about 840 special federal helpers dispatched by Bush?
[01:02:35.399 --> 01:02:36.580]  I know I'll sleep better tonight.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.180]  How about you?
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.642]  Yeah, they're out there making sure everything's okay for us.
[01:02:41.394 --> 01:02:41.674]  Right.
[01:02:42.154 --> 01:02:48.376]  And of course, Pinellas County is where some of the more famous openly where they got caught election fraud took place.
[01:02:49.276 --> 01:02:54.637]  Yeah, I think Bev may have been down there when she was doing her Volusia County investigations last year.
[01:02:54.717 --> 01:02:55.977]  I'm so glad you're having her on today.
[01:02:56.017 --> 01:03:00.118]  That HBO special, if people haven't watched it yet, I'm sure you're already promoting it.
[01:03:00.138 --> 01:03:01.999]  Thank goodness you are and others are.
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:09.094]  It's been a real eye-opener for those Americans that still have not realized or believed that we have electronic vote theft going on.
[01:03:09.134 --> 01:03:10.534]  Well, Vicki Karp, they told us... Every day.
[01:03:10.814 --> 01:03:11.215]  Exactly.
[01:03:11.235 --> 01:03:12.335]  They told us we couldn't win.
[01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.576]  They told us we couldn't fight back.
[01:03:13.616 --> 01:03:15.157]  They told us we were three-headed monsters.
[01:03:15.457 --> 01:03:16.258]  That we were kooks.
[01:03:16.618 --> 01:03:21.401]  Now, 90-plus percent of Americans know us for fraud, and we're going to defeat them on this issue, too.
[01:03:21.701 --> 01:03:22.981]  And you were there from the start.
[01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:25.643]  You were there telling them that you weren't going to go along with the fraud.
[01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:31.306]  And it's because I was listening to your show, and I heard you interviewing Bev Harris, so I got involved in this.
[01:03:31.326 --> 01:03:32.607]  I still want to thank you for that, Alex.
[01:03:33.149 --> 01:03:38.954]  Now I want to thank you for hearing the call and getting with us on the front line, side by side, against the New World Order.
[01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:44.919]  Check in with us in the last five minutes of this hour if you can, Vicki Karp, and check in with us at the end of the third hour.
[01:03:44.999 --> 01:03:45.759]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:46.900]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.561]  Appreciate it.
[01:03:47.601 --> 01:03:47.901]  Bye-bye.
[01:03:48.021 --> 01:03:48.381]  You bet.
[01:03:48.401 --> 01:03:49.282]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:50.343]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.346 --> 01:03:56.806]  It's here!
[01:03:57.006 --> 01:04:01.767]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.167 --> 01:04:09.829]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.509 --> 01:04:17.550]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.951 --> 01:04:24.872]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:29.349]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.669 --> 01:04:33.190]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.551]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:39.853]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:58.805]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.085 --> 01:05:03.231]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.672 --> 01:05:04.493]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:09.380]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.861 --> 01:05:11.982]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:06:00.852 --> 01:06:09.336]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:06:09.496 --> 01:06:10.657]  You can order everything you need
[01:06:10.657 --> 01:06:10.997]  We're good to go.
[01:06:27.102 --> 01:06:27.502]  I don't know.
[01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:56.191]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.772 --> 01:06:59.572]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:19.238 --> 01:07:30.382]  A toll-free number to join us with reports from around the country of election fraud, of flipping votes, of machines crashing, of special federal helpers being on scene when it happens.
[01:07:30.822 --> 01:07:37.004]  I've looked at maps of the key battleground states, the key battleground congressional seats up for grabs.
[01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:43.326]  Even mainline neocons say the Republicans should lose at least 17 House seats, 2 to 4 Senate seats.
[01:07:43.346 --> 01:07:44.587]  That's what Novak's saying.
[01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:47.851]  But Roe's saying they're not going to lose anything.
[01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:49.553]  In fact, they might have a landslide.
[01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:52.997]  And you notice, and again I started noticing this morning, I was looking at it, I was going, wait.
[01:07:53.729 --> 01:07:55.910]  Machine problems in Connecticut.
[01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.430]  Machine problems in Florida.
[01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.670]  Machine problems in Ohio.
[01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:59.871]  Machine problems in Pennsylvania.
[01:08:00.151 --> 01:08:01.391]  Machine problems in Texas.
[01:08:01.431 --> 01:08:02.851]  Machine problems in California.
[01:08:03.231 --> 01:08:04.412]  Machine problems in Oregon.
[01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:05.772]  Machine problems in New Mexico.
[01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:08.333]  All the same key battleground areas.
[01:08:09.533 --> 01:08:11.273]  Now there's some problems in other areas as well.
[01:08:11.493 --> 01:08:13.294]  And some of this is because there's no oversight.
[01:08:13.314 --> 01:08:16.235]  These machines are fraud based and you know they just don't care.
[01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.095]  Because there's no oversight.
[01:08:18.115 --> 01:08:19.255]  But a lot of it is fraud.
[01:08:19.275 --> 01:08:21.216]  And we're having big fraud and problems
[01:08:22.083 --> 01:08:28.506]  It's a mix of it here in Travis County where Austin is, where I'm broadcasting from, in the geographical heart of Texas, in the geographic heart of Texas.
[01:08:29.886 --> 01:08:30.587]  So it's real.
[01:08:31.067 --> 01:08:31.927]  It's happening again.
[01:08:32.247 --> 01:08:41.631]  Thirty-five percent of the country has the new machines that the government paid for with the Help Americans Vote Act of Chuckie Schumer and George Bush.
[01:08:41.731 --> 01:08:45.152]  They both sponsored it and wrote it together, the White House and Chuckie Schumer.
[01:08:47.134 --> 01:08:48.575]  dual citizen of Israel.
[01:08:48.635 --> 01:08:52.156]  I mean, we're a totally dominated and controlled nation.
[01:08:53.957 --> 01:09:00.540]  And this is why you see the arrogance of government where polls show that 97% don't want toll roads.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.240]  They just do it.
[01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:08.199]  99% don't like the New London Kilo decision to let private interest grab your private property and pay off local politicians.
[01:09:08.239 --> 01:09:08.980]  It actually shows that.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:09.780]  They don't care.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.761]  They laugh at us.
[01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:17.125]  90% don't want open borders and want sovereignty and don't want the SPP.gov world government system.
[01:09:17.525 --> 01:09:18.365]  North American Union.
[01:09:18.466 --> 01:09:19.086]  They don't care.
[01:09:21.327 --> 01:09:25.750]  For political news junkies who've been watching this for years, we're seeing a new attitude out of government.
[01:09:26.451 --> 01:09:27.191]  Despotism.
[01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:28.072]  A smirk.
[01:09:29.052 --> 01:09:30.153]  And it's because they know.
[01:09:31.218 --> 01:09:34.361]  That they are taking total control and they've got the will to do it.
[01:09:34.761 --> 01:09:38.164]  But I don't think they estimated how many of us would have the will to resist them.
[01:09:38.604 --> 01:09:40.385]  And all of their illusion is imploding.
[01:09:40.405 --> 01:09:46.070]  Before we go to Michael Rivero, I just want to tell you, you need to visit WhatReallyHappened.com every day.
[01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.092]  It's one of the four sites I visit repeatedly daily.
[01:09:49.132 --> 01:09:50.813]  He's got some of the best election coverage.
[01:09:51.494 --> 01:10:00.201]  Quite frankly, that's one of the places we go to grab stories that he's found and his listeners have found to post at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:01.258 --> 01:10:02.639]  And he just does a great job.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.864]  He also graciously last week put a link to Amazon.com where you can buy my new film, Terror Storm, for $11.19.
[01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:14.909]  We priced it so low, folks, that I basically make about $0.45 a piece on them.
[01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.511]  It's about getting the info out.
[01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:19.413]  It's why I put it out for free on Google Video.
[01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:27.820]  But Amazon did sell out of them, and then they have changed the link that everybody linked to, to where you went to other products.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.562]  A lot of weirdness that my distributor says he's never seen before.
[01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:46.703]  So just like Google censored us and erased repeatedly and admitted they erased, accidentally of course, our viewer tallies, which push us to the top of the 100, every time we get up into the top 20 or so they would erase us because that's where most people do their video viewing is in the Google Top 100.
[01:10:47.463 --> 01:10:49.763]  Millions of potential new viewers are found there.
[01:10:51.184 --> 01:10:59.906]  So they're trying to stop us right now and I'm asking you, even if you've already ordered TerraStorm, buy it as a gift for your spouse or your neighbor or buy it and donate it to the library locally.
[01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:02.609]  That's a good idea, isn't it?
[01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:05.751]  Or give it to your professor, or your school teacher, or your best friend.
[01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:08.752]  You've got a birthday coming up next week for your neighbor, or your son or daughter.
[01:11:09.413 --> 01:11:12.615]  Go to Amazon.com and order it.
[01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.517]  By the way, they've got it in stock.
[01:11:15.557 --> 01:11:16.837]  They took delivery yesterday.
[01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:18.999]  They never say four to six weeks for delivery.
[01:11:19.279 --> 01:11:22.821]  When they sold out last week, they were saying four to six weeks, which is keeping people from ordering it.
[01:11:24.131 --> 01:11:26.232]  Every trick in the book, and you'd think they'd want to make money.
[01:11:26.832 --> 01:11:33.114]  In publishing and in filmmaking, well look, Diebold tried to block Hacking Democracy, Bev Harris' new book, I mean new video.
[01:11:34.634 --> 01:11:35.975]  They're doing everything they can.
[01:11:36.555 --> 01:11:40.556]  They called theaters around the country openly and threatened them not to carry Aaron Russo's film.
[01:11:40.576 --> 01:11:44.317]  They called ABC and said, don't interview Aaron Russo on Good Morning America.
[01:11:44.597 --> 01:11:46.398]  They called radio stations up and blocked him.
[01:11:46.498 --> 01:11:47.518]  I deal with this all the time.
[01:11:47.878 --> 01:11:49.919]  Oh, we were going to have you on, but we've been told not to have you on.
[01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:52.920]  Sometimes they're truthful, sometimes they just say, oh no, we're not going to do it now.
[01:11:53.616 --> 01:11:54.957]  Don't let them have their way.
[01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:57.960]  Push it to number 1 on Amazon.com.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.100]  We got to number 9.
[01:11:59.461 --> 01:12:00.341]  I saw it at number 9.
[01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:01.142]  I'm told it went to number 8.
[01:12:01.863 --> 01:12:03.244]  Let's push it up there to number 1.
[01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:04.865]  Then I can say we hit number 1.
[01:12:05.165 --> 01:12:06.967]  It's a great way to hype it and get others to get it.
[01:12:08.148 --> 01:12:13.412]  People who order it around the country, different chains, use that as their number 1 indicator on what to order.
[01:12:14.207 --> 01:12:16.649]  And then after it goes to number one, I will shut up about it.
[01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:19.092]  But now is the time to drive it back to number one.
[01:12:19.612 --> 01:12:22.375]  It's still in the top 100, but a long way from number one.
[01:12:22.475 --> 01:12:23.015]  Help us!
[01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.398]  If you can afford it, go buy 20 copies.
[01:12:25.418 --> 01:12:26.659]  You've never heard me talk like this.
[01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:27.740]  I'm asking you for your help.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.941]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[01:12:28.961 --> 01:12:34.426]  He's going to be with us for the balance of the broadcast, riding shotgun into the next hour with Bev Harris, who's extremely busy.
[01:12:34.466 --> 01:12:35.808]  We're honored to have her joining us.
[01:12:36.248 --> 01:12:37.910]  We're going to have Vicki Karp locally with
[01:12:39.196 --> 01:12:44.678]  Vote Rescue with massive evidence of, quote, problems and fraud pouring in in Central Texas.
[01:12:44.698 --> 01:12:48.000]  She'll be popping in with five-minute reports at the end of this hour and the next hour.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.260]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.542]  We'll be taking her calls as well each segment with continual coverage.
[01:12:53.622 --> 01:12:56.883]  There's one guy I wanted to have on, and that's Michael Rivero.
[01:12:56.903 --> 01:13:03.306]  I'm glad his monthly interview date just happened to fall on this date because I was already planning to shut him up last week until I noticed he was already set up.
[01:13:03.386 --> 01:13:07.388]  I said, shut him up for November 7th, and Kevin, my producer, said he's already set up.
[01:13:08.248 --> 01:13:10.189]  Michael Rivero, thank you for joining us.
[01:13:11.049 --> 01:13:14.671]  Well, thank you for having me again, especially on such an important day.
[01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:20.013]  Well, it's always great to have you, Mike, and you're one of the most favorite guests with our listeners.
[01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:27.155]  Give us, you've got the floor for six minutes, give us your analysis of what's coming in around the country and what you see happening.
[01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:36.759]  Well, before I do that, I just wanted to back up to TerrorStorm real quick because something that your readers may want to do, under the rules by which cable TV companies are allowed to operate in the U.S.,
[01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:50.114]  They have a thing called Public Access Channels, and you can go in there with a copy of a DVD of Terror Storm or anything else you feel is an important thing the community should see, and they have to let you put it on the air.
[01:13:50.474 --> 01:14:01.558]  And you might want to even put a note on your little website saying, Authorized for Showing on Community Access Cable TV Channels, and that way people around the country could get a copy of it, they can go to the cable TV company, they can get it aired.
[01:14:01.894 --> 01:14:13.738]  The first time I saw the video, the Clinton Chronicles was on a public access channel here in Hawaii, and it floored me to go out and get, yeah, and so that's an important venue for people to take Terror Storm into.
[01:14:14.019 --> 01:14:28.264]  Now, having gotten that, we're seeing all kinds of reports of vote problems, long lines, machines not working, oh my goodness we forgot the power cords, and at the same time we're starting to see a flood of articles hit the mainstream press
[01:14:28.772 --> 01:14:32.878]  Sort of pre-explaining away why the Republicans are going to do well in this election.
[01:14:33.319 --> 01:14:38.165]  One of the most bizarre came out about an hour ago, basically saying that scientists had...
[01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:51.015]  It's proven somehow that rainy weather was going to keep the Democrats indoors, but Republicans would go out and vote anyway, and therefore anywhere it's raining we should expect to see a Republican plurality vote.
[01:14:51.035 --> 01:14:58.117]  So we see a preparatory move saying don't trust exit polls, the rainy weather kept the Democrats, oh it wasn't going to be a landslide.
[01:14:58.317 --> 01:15:01.617]  They're now explaining to us why the Republicans aren't going to lose.
[01:15:02.517 --> 01:15:03.678]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:15:03.718 --> 01:15:05.398]  It's a pre-spin going on there.
[01:15:06.008 --> 01:15:13.470]  And even though there are supposedly no exit polls, the Wall Street Journal just now put up an article saying Republicans see edge from early voting.
[01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:15.531]  See, we're winning already, guys!
[01:15:15.771 --> 01:15:21.533]  And Drudge and Limbaugh and Bortz and all their disinformation officers have been spouting the same line for two weeks.
[01:15:22.353 --> 01:15:30.255]  Yeah, and it really is, and yet the independent, reliable polls that we can get are continuing to show Democrat gains.
[01:15:30.315 --> 01:15:32.596]  Zogby Mason Dixon.
[01:15:33.484 --> 01:15:33.764]  Yes.
[01:15:34.485 --> 01:15:43.113]  And frankly, as much as I would love to see a change in the administration and the Congress, I do feel that we're heading for another massive vote theft.
[01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:45.315]  I would love to be proven wrong on this one.
[01:15:45.815 --> 01:15:51.440]  And unfortunately, there's almost a dual-edged sword going on here.
[01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:54.823]  Because there are so many reports of vote fraud and problems.
[01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:58.967]  If the GOP loses massively this election,
[01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:02.972]  Bush could turn around and say, well, look at all the election fraud we had going on.
[01:16:03.012 --> 01:16:04.533]  It was those darn Democrats.
[01:16:04.633 --> 01:16:08.676]  And, you know, might do something dramatic like even declare the election invalid.
[01:16:08.876 --> 01:16:12.139]  But if he steals it, it's going to cause a revolution.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.061]  I would tend to agree with you.
[01:16:15.121 --> 01:16:19.224]  I mean, we're seeing, you know, the mainstream media is trying to ignore what's going on in Mexico.
[01:16:19.545 --> 01:16:21.786]  But there were three bombings in Mexico City today.
[01:16:22.107 --> 01:16:26.390]  And all of this, you know, really goes back to that fraudulent presidential election.
[01:16:26.846 --> 01:16:29.868]  The Mexicans are just not going to stand to have their government stolen.
[01:16:29.908 --> 01:16:31.129]  They've been taking over cities.
[01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:40.337]  Yeah, and they stand a good chance of winning because even people within the government realize that, you know, they've lost the moral high ground on that one.
[01:16:42.278 --> 01:16:43.559]  Greg Powell disagrees with you.
[01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.841]  He wrote an article last night saying how the 2006 midterm was stolen.
[01:16:48.766 --> 01:16:51.408]  Yeah, and I'm afraid he's right.
[01:16:51.728 --> 01:17:07.678]  I hope the American people will get angry about it because it is inexcusable that a nation that is one of the most technologically advanced on Earth, that put men on the moon, built space stations, that we can't make a voting system that is tamper-proof and honest and transparent.
[01:17:08.058 --> 01:17:09.539]  I don't believe that, not for a moment.
[01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:18.685]  Especially when you have some of our voting machines are made by the same company that makes automated teller machines that don't lose a penny from one end of this country to the other.
[01:17:19.165 --> 01:17:21.766]  And yet they can't make a voting machine that can keep track of the votes?
[01:17:22.247 --> 01:17:22.747]  I don't buy that.
[01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:25.211]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:17:26.171 --> 01:17:29.173]  Just the arrogant aplomb that we're witnessing now.
[01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:41.422]  If the Republicans only lose ten seats and maybe one Senate seat, that'll be called a loss, but that will be evidence of a fraud because they don't have total control in every precinct or every congressional district in the country.
[01:17:41.842 --> 01:17:48.306]  So, would you say that we can dub it fraud because all the polls show that the Republicans should have a massive landslide loss?
[01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:52.009]  It's still going to be a fraud, even if they have a moderate loss.
[01:17:53.354 --> 01:18:00.117]  Yeah, I would say that at this point we can pretty much conclude fraud is taking place regardless of the outcome of the election.
[01:18:00.577 --> 01:18:12.761]  What is the sole cause for hope is that enough people are going to get out and vote and it's going to be such a landslide that the vote fraud won't be able to overcome it because vote fraud only works with close races.
[01:18:13.882 --> 01:18:17.203]  It only works where there's only a few percentage points change needed.
[01:18:18.078 --> 01:18:20.678]  Or it becomes too obvious and people know there's a fraud.
[01:18:21.019 --> 01:18:27.140]  And if there's going to be a fraud, we need to force them to have, you know, a 10% difference in exit polls and scientific polls.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.480]  This will be the third time.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.020]  It will be proven to everyone.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.460]  They stole the last two.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.381]  That evidence that we had, vote fraud, they do it a third time.
[01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.221]  I think it's going to be the coup de grace.

[01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:55.981]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:56.661 --> 01:20:08.944]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful, one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[01:20:09.831 --> 01:20:13.515]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:20.521]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[01:20:21.162 --> 01:20:28.869]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:57.732]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:58.212 --> 01:20:58.873]  One and the same.
[01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:03.593]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:03.613 --> 01:21:05.674]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.194]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:07.735]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:08.496]  Here is reality.
[01:21:08.516 --> 01:21:10.957]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:10.977 --> 01:21:13.778]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:29.591 --> 01:21:33.354]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:21:33.774 --> 01:21:37.496]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:21:39.057 --> 01:21:39.258]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.388 --> 01:21:53.950]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:56.272]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:15.171]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:23:15.211 --> 01:23:17.473]  Michael Rivera, writing Shotgun for The Balance, the broadcast.
[01:23:17.513 --> 01:23:17.934]  Beth Harris.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.482]  Expert on election fraud, tracking and chronicling, writing books on it, and now a big HBO special that's aired multiple times in the last week.
[01:23:25.862 --> 01:23:26.582]  She'll be joining us.
[01:23:26.982 --> 01:23:28.303]  Right now, let's go to some calls.
[01:23:28.343 --> 01:23:32.544]  Callers, please have your questions or comments about the election quick and succinct so we can get to everybody.
[01:23:33.064 --> 01:23:33.984]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:23:34.364 --> 01:23:35.905]  Alex in Connecticut, welcome.
[01:23:36.525 --> 01:23:37.885]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:23:37.945 --> 01:23:38.185]  Fine.
[01:23:38.465 --> 01:23:38.686]  Good.
[01:23:39.046 --> 01:23:45.247]  I just voted today and just wanted to know about the machines, if this is good.
[01:23:45.988 --> 01:23:47.588]  We had a paper ballot and it's
[01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:48.581]  I don't know.
[01:24:00.051 --> 01:24:00.792]  That's it.
[01:24:00.912 --> 01:24:05.578]  Those are better than the new machines because the new machines have no record, no way to prove it.
[01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:10.804]  Coast to coast with the old machines they still computerize them, but then people can pay for recounts.
[01:24:10.844 --> 01:24:17.712]  The problem is the same county clerks or election officials that ran the original fraud can then just refeed them and come up with the same fraud.
[01:24:18.432 --> 01:24:25.474]  Uh, yet again, so we need to go back to pure paper, then you find out the next day, but it's hard to centralize it.
[01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:34.317]  The reason the new machines are even worse than the Scantron computerized paper ballot is because before, locals had to steal it and cheat it normally.
[01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:41.020]  Yeah, the problem is that you need to design a system up front that prevents these kind of frauds, but what we're seeing are systems in which
[01:25:01.207 --> 01:25:04.488]  Uh, the means to commit these kind of frauds are very clearly built in.
[01:25:04.508 --> 01:25:05.108]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:14.211]  The issue, yeah, the issue of being able to load the memory cards with software that gets run only on election day, that's been documented.
[01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:20.113]  The ability to preload the cards with non-zero votes to swing the election has been documented.
[01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:25.243]  It is clearly a system that is really wide open to all kinds of fraud and tampering.
[01:25:25.483 --> 01:25:29.586]  And by the way, with the big four companies, you see the very same things being built in.
[01:25:29.606 --> 01:25:31.428]  I mean, these aren't back doors.
[01:25:31.468 --> 01:25:33.109]  These are giant city gates.
[01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:34.590]  I mean, these things are made.
[01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:42.535]  Engineers who have bought the machines and then reverse engineered them, it sometimes takes minutes for them to break in and shut it up for fraud.
[01:25:42.575 --> 01:25:43.936]  They are designed for fraud.
[01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:47.879]  Yeah, it is really very easy to tamper them.
[01:25:47.999 --> 01:25:49.400]  Certain features of the machines
[01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:56.696]  Clearly indicate a desire to allow them to be changed on the fly without notice during election day.
[01:25:56.996 --> 01:26:16.845]  What you were saying before about the same people doing the recounts that did the original elections, we had a contested election here in Hawaii some years ago and it was a governor's race and was highly contested and the governor basically who had won re-election said I will resign if fraud is proven
[01:26:17.304 --> 01:26:21.726]  But then they turned around and said, well, before we do an actual recount, let's just have the machines checked.
[01:26:22.126 --> 01:26:31.250]  And then they went back to the company, ES&S, that had provided the machines and said, you check these machines for us, and if it turns out there's a problem, you don't get the money that we promised to pay you.
[01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:34.892]  So they asked the weasel... ES&S came back and said, you know, they work.
[01:26:35.172 --> 01:26:38.733]  And the governor said, well, we don't need a recount, and that was kind of the end of the issue.
[01:26:38.953 --> 01:26:42.835]  So they go back to the weasel to do an investigation at the hen house.
[01:26:43.721 --> 01:26:47.262]  Absolutely, and there is no outside oversight.
[01:26:47.982 --> 01:26:57.464]  As I talk to people about the issue of vote fraud, they are stunned to find out that the company that does the vote counting on national elections, that it is a company.
[01:26:57.544 --> 01:26:58.685]  It's not a government agency.
[01:26:58.725 --> 01:26:59.765]  It's not a citizen's group.
[01:27:00.145 --> 01:27:05.106]  It is a company that is owned by the major media, TV networks and key newspapers.
[01:27:05.686 --> 01:27:09.907]  It's a private company, and nobody is looking at what they're doing.
[01:27:10.287 --> 01:27:11.308]  Nobody's keeping track.
[01:27:11.328 --> 01:27:12.508]  Nobody's checking up on them.
[01:27:12.873 --> 01:27:14.734]  And most Americans are completely unaware of this.
[01:27:16.235 --> 01:27:16.976]  Alright, Alex.
[01:27:17.036 --> 01:27:18.156]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:18.196 --> 01:27:18.997]  Let's go to one more.
[01:27:19.077 --> 01:27:20.358]  Rob in Pennsylvania.
[01:27:20.398 --> 01:27:20.778]  Welcome.
[01:27:21.899 --> 01:27:22.719]  Aloha, Michael.
[01:27:22.739 --> 01:27:23.600]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:24.981]  Good, sir.
[01:27:25.001 --> 01:27:25.261]  Go ahead.
[01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:27.182]  Yeah, I just wanted to confirm.
[01:27:27.202 --> 01:27:38.769]  I had to hold my nose and listen to the local Clear Channel station here last week in my car because, unfortunately, we don't get you on the air, but I heard one of the most farcical things last week.
[01:27:38.969 --> 01:27:40.190]  Limbaugh was saying that
[01:27:41.641 --> 01:27:54.646]  The early voting was going to benefit the Republicans, and therefore, they would not be able to give any meaningful exit polling data, because the Republicans already had it won.
[01:27:54.926 --> 01:28:08.051]  Sure, it shows that Democrats are going in droves, almost 2 to 1 in some areas of the country, in early voting, falsely believing that that stops the tampering when they still just feed those into machines.
[01:28:09.523 --> 01:28:20.486]  And again, the story, Michael, that you brought up about the Republicans tend to come out in the rain, that's just got to be one of the most laughable things I've ever heard.
[01:28:20.566 --> 01:28:21.706]  I got a laugh out of that one.
[01:28:22.166 --> 01:28:22.447]  Yeah.
[01:28:22.947 --> 01:28:23.947]  But thanks, guys.
[01:28:24.027 --> 01:28:26.768]  Congratulations on the hard work you're doing, and we're winning!
[01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:28.688]  We are going to win this thing, yeah.
[01:28:29.608 --> 01:28:35.030]  The key here is the pre-spin off talking points that Michael Rivera was just talking about.
[01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:37.784]  Where they're saying, oh, don't believe the exit polls.
[01:28:37.885 --> 01:28:38.745]  Oh, the rain.
[01:28:38.905 --> 01:28:41.127]  Oh, ignore all those scientific polls.
[01:28:42.367 --> 01:28:43.268]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.748 --> 01:28:45.369]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.290 --> 01:28:48.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.692 --> 01:28:59.114]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:04.255]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:29:04.675 --> 01:29:07.296]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:29:07.796 --> 01:29:11.197]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:29:11.978 --> 01:29:16.299]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:29:16.739 --> 01:29:19.920]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.361]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:29:24.139 --> 01:29:26.280]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.080]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.

[01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:32.262]  Ask for George.
[01:29:51.883 --> 01:30:00.150]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:04.753]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:05.054 --> 01:30:13.961]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:30:18.084 --> 01:30:23.114]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:23.414 --> 01:30:30.107]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.261]  What about you?
[01:30:31.921 --> 01:30:37.267]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:32:31.957 --> 01:32:50.884]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[01:32:54.045 --> 01:32:56.265]  My sweetest friend
[01:32:58.881 --> 01:33:08.225]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[01:33:09.045 --> 01:33:12.046]  And you could have it all.
[01:33:13.367 --> 01:33:19.489]  My empire of dirt.
[01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:22.510]  I will let you down.
[01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:25.811]  I will make you hurt.
[01:33:40.423 --> 01:33:50.210]  I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair.
[01:33:51.290 --> 01:34:00.356]  Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
[01:34:01.577 --> 01:34:05.059]  Beneath the stains of time
[01:34:06.883 --> 01:34:10.105]  The feelings disappear.
[01:34:12.526 --> 01:34:15.448]  You are someone else.
[01:34:18.329 --> 01:34:23.112]  I am still right here.
[01:34:23.172 --> 01:34:25.814]  What have I become?
[01:34:30.223 --> 01:34:35.945]  It's sad to see what our country has turned into.
[01:34:36.205 --> 01:34:48.531]  Most analysts, most constitutional scholars officially say the Republic is dead, officially, with the signing of the Defense Authorization Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, signed the same day that Bush signed the evil twin
[01:34:49.796 --> 01:34:52.418]  The Military Commissions Act, H.R.
[01:34:52.438 --> 01:34:59.523]  6166, continual coverage of the election, clear evidence of the same pattern in every key battleground area where neocons are going to lose.
[01:35:00.243 --> 01:35:02.105]  We're seeing, quote, massive problems.
[01:35:02.165 --> 01:35:05.787]  We know these companies have stolen the elections the last three times.
[01:35:05.807 --> 01:35:09.029]  They're doing it yet again in front of everyone.
[01:35:09.610 --> 01:35:12.732]  But in the past, Americans couldn't bring themselves to believe this.
[01:35:12.752 --> 01:35:14.073]  And now people have been educated.
[01:35:14.113 --> 01:35:16.414]  Now it's even a watered-down version, I have to say.
[01:35:16.735 --> 01:35:17.655]  I've seen it now.
[01:35:17.675 --> 01:35:18.636]  It's been on HBO.
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:20.320]  It's pretty darn good.
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:30.364]  The people now are being able to face the horror, not just that horror, but the lie of the Iraq War, the lie of 9-11, the lies about the economy, everything.
[01:35:31.024 --> 01:35:39.066]  Michael Rivero, give us your analysis, not just on this election today as we track it, but what you see happening in the next few weeks.
[01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:44.248]  I mean, will Bush, if he's able to steal this election again or minimize Republican losses,
[01:35:45.511 --> 01:35:50.536]  With his allied Democrats in there, do you think you'll see this as a green light for Israel to go back into Lebanon?
[01:35:50.556 --> 01:35:51.777]  They're saying they may go back into Lebanon.
[01:35:52.017 --> 01:35:52.678]  They may strike.
[01:35:53.538 --> 01:36:03.287]  Haratz is reporting today, as well as the Jerusalem Post, I know this is a side of whatreallyhappened.com, that they may go ahead and go into Syria or attack Syria out of the blue.
[01:36:05.369 --> 01:36:07.931]  Or if they lose, will they see it as a green light?
[01:36:08.171 --> 01:36:09.052]  What do you see happening there?
[01:36:10.292 --> 01:36:19.097]  Well, I'm afraid that the outcome of today's election is not likely to have much of an impact at all on the overall war agenda for the Mideast.
[01:36:19.517 --> 01:36:24.319]  I think, if anything, it might have a significant effect on the timetable.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:33.944]  If, in fact, Bush loses control of both houses of Congress, he's still got two months to do basically anything he wants to with the current Congress.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:40.844]  And certainly it appears that a major military operation is already being prepared, probably for Iran.
[01:36:42.124 --> 01:36:48.468]  Israel certainly wants Syria gotten rid of and basically Balkanized.
[01:36:49.329 --> 01:36:51.390]  So I think that is still going to go on.
[01:36:51.810 --> 01:36:57.053]  After the first of the year with a new Congress, it's going to become more and more difficult for Bush to pursue the war agenda.
[01:36:57.586 --> 01:37:05.369]  So if there is a loss of Congress for Bush today, I would expect the invasion of Iran to be happening within a few days at most.
[01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:10.931]  We do have to wait, of course, for the various legal challenges that are inevitably going to... So you think that... Cover that in a minute.
[01:37:10.951 --> 01:37:13.091]  I want to go back to something you just said, because I agree with you.
[01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:21.114]  You think it may actually corner the rat even further to strike out if they lose, because they know that will then trigger impeachment hearings.
[01:37:22.475 --> 01:37:30.380]  Well, even without impeachment hearings, and of course I'm appalled by Nancy Pelosi saying that there will be no impeachment hearings even if the Democrats win.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.880]  Well, who is she to say that?
[01:37:31.981 --> 01:37:34.242]  She may not be able to control them.
[01:37:35.403 --> 01:37:39.785]  Well, she may not be able to, but I think it's still a very, very terrible thing for her to be saying.
[01:37:40.225 --> 01:37:46.609]  But even without impeachment, which is going to be very hard to come about because they're all kind of complicit in what's been going on,
[01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:57.513]  With a Democratic Congress basically saying we don't want to go any further on this military action, you know, it's going to bring the war agenda basically to a standstill.
[01:37:57.533 --> 01:38:02.678]  And as far as I'm concerned... So you're saying he may want to launch the attack before the Democrats and the new Congress organize it?
[01:38:03.399 --> 01:38:05.160]  Absolutely he would want to do that.
[01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:07.223]  And it may be more than just Iran.
[01:38:07.263 --> 01:38:10.486]  If they've got four or five different countries they want to attack,
[01:38:11.196 --> 01:38:13.577]  We're probably going to see a major escalation in the Mideast.
[01:38:13.877 --> 01:38:19.360]  There may be some false flag attacks to try and kick it off and regain the support of the American people.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.501]  I don't think Americans are going to fall for that.
[01:38:22.161 --> 01:38:32.706]  The poll numbers in terms of Americans trusting the government, believing the official story about Iraq, or believing the official story about 9-11 for that matter, the numbers continue to go against Bush.
[01:38:33.286 --> 01:38:38.569]  So I think it's just going to be a case of blustering his way through from now until the new Congress is seated.
[01:38:39.176 --> 01:38:43.281]  Michael Rivero, so many of your predictions, so much of your analysis has come true.
[01:38:43.321 --> 01:38:47.846]  I really can't think of a time when you've been wrong, and unfortunately I tend to agree with much of what you're saying.
[01:38:48.427 --> 01:38:49.188]  I don't like it.
[01:38:49.508 --> 01:38:52.011]  I don't like the fact... I mean, do you feel like you've been robbed?
[01:38:52.031 --> 01:38:54.394]  That you'd be living another life?
[01:38:54.414 --> 01:38:58.819]  I mean, I'm just sick of this, and it just disgusts me to see it getting worse and worse.
[01:39:00.635 --> 01:39:14.278]  Well, yeah, we can all sit and speculate about what life would be like had we managed to derail a lot of what was going on when it started becoming apparent this was the direction the nation was going, you know, about 14, 15 years ago.
[01:39:15.138 --> 01:39:27.141]  But it's kind of a, you know, it's kind of a waste because we are where we are and what we need to really focus on is what's going on today and what can we do to change the course for what's going to happen tomorrow.
[01:39:27.597 --> 01:39:29.581]  We are in a very perilous situation.
[01:39:31.486 --> 01:39:38.000]  Bush has become the dictator he used to joke about in the face of rigged and phony elections.
[01:39:39.193 --> 01:39:44.256]  The American people have lost control of their own government, and of course that is an extraordinarily dangerous situation.
[01:39:44.336 --> 01:39:53.562]  So you agree with the analysis, it's pretty much unanimous, that Bush has now announced the power of a dictator, but the question is, will he be able to implement it?
[01:39:53.982 --> 01:40:02.647]  And out of hubris, he may go ahead and drive through with the sheer power of his own inertia, but it's just horrible.
[01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:08.270]  Well, under the existing laws that have been written to cover national emergencies,
[01:40:08.803 --> 01:40:18.868]  All Bush needs is a crisis of some kind and he could, under laws already in effect, he could suspend the Constitution and the Congress and make himself President for life.
[01:40:18.928 --> 01:40:24.831]  Now, I don't see him doing that because of the simple fact that I really don't think the American people
[01:40:25.213 --> 01:40:33.582]  Absolutely, and I think that's one of the reasons we've seen the neocons in the last few weeks really start to turn on Bush.
[01:40:49.142 --> 01:40:59.128]  It may be that they're simply saying, okay, we've used up the Republicans as much as we can, let's start making nice-nice with the Democrats and start using them for our plans for the next few years.
[01:40:59.148 --> 01:41:00.909]  Yeah, the whole Lieberman-Hillary wing.
[01:41:01.749 --> 01:41:02.870]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:08.893]  Now Rupert Murdoch believes in global warming and the global tax, now he believes in Hillary, now he's financing Al Gore.
[01:41:10.594 --> 01:41:13.916]  Yeah, absolutely, and I think it's just a case of
[01:41:14.757 --> 01:41:18.879]  The Republicans and the Democrats are really just two faces of the same corruption.
[01:41:19.499 --> 01:41:21.460]  And they just flip them off every once in a while.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.882]  So we're allowed to feel like we're really making a choice.
[01:41:25.242 --> 01:41:28.103]  But it reminds me of the old game that babysitters used to play.
[01:41:28.844 --> 01:41:32.285]  You know, they'd be taking care of a little person and they'd say, I will give you a choice.
[01:41:32.705 --> 01:41:35.547]  You can either go to bed at eight o'clock or at 830.
[01:41:35.927 --> 01:41:37.648]  And the kid would say, Oh, well, I want to go to bed at 830.
[01:41:38.653 --> 01:41:45.915]  And the child would then go to bed without fuss and argument at 8.30, thinking he had a choice, when the real agenda was to get the kid asleep by 9 o'clock.
[01:41:47.115 --> 01:41:47.996]  Exactly.
[01:41:50.056 --> 01:41:50.516]  No, I agree.
[01:41:50.556 --> 01:41:51.737]  That's a great analogy.
[01:41:51.817 --> 01:41:54.177]  It's the false choice paradigm.
[01:41:54.937 --> 01:41:55.878]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:56.478 --> 01:42:04.220]  And the Republican versus Democrat is a false paradigm, because ultimately they all have the same agenda, which is ruling the country.
[01:42:05.785 --> 01:42:09.214]  Extracting as much taxes as they can from us by any means that they can.
[01:42:09.615 --> 01:42:12.363]  And just to keep the party going on as long as possible.
[01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:15.347]  There's a problem, though.
[01:42:15.548 --> 01:42:38.676]  The elite isn't as hard-working as the David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger old guard, and I've talked to many analysts who've studied Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, CFR, Club of Rome, International Affairs, that the new crop that is now rising to total control are a bunch of crazy playboys, are a bunch of drug addicts, are a bunch of
[01:42:39.296 --> 01:42:43.799]  Yeah, I agree with you and I think it's a common feature throughout history
[01:43:05.598 --> 01:43:23.349]  That every time that there is a major change in the way a nation operates, the first people in there worked hard to make it happen, and they have a great deal of respect for what it took to get there, right or wrong, and they will attempt to take care of the situation that they've created.
[01:43:23.809 --> 01:43:31.874]  But as the new generation comes along and they simply inherit the wealth and power, they don't have any respect for what it took to get there, and they tend to treat it like
[01:43:32.259 --> 01:43:33.403]  Anything else they've inherited.
[01:43:33.503 --> 01:43:35.630]  It's just something that's there for them to play with and use.
[01:43:37.822 --> 01:43:38.283]  Oh boy.
[01:43:38.783 --> 01:43:44.307]  So from a sociological perspective, it's not just the elite degenerating, the general population is degenerating.
[01:43:44.327 --> 01:43:45.068]  That's a large group.
[01:43:45.108 --> 01:43:46.308]  A large group is waking up.
[01:43:46.649 --> 01:43:49.351]  We see a renaissance always in a decadent cycle.
[01:43:49.751 --> 01:43:59.198]  Near the bottom of the decadent cycle, we see the genesis, the rebirth of those that will then be the new leaders of the society and set it back on the right course.
[01:43:59.498 --> 01:44:02.320]  How long do you think it will take for us to dig out of this deep pit?
[01:44:05.949 --> 01:44:16.253]  My favorite outcome for what's going on will be that the current US government is going to collapse of its own decadence and rot and death the way the former USSR did.
[01:44:16.714 --> 01:44:28.278]  And there will be a little bit of confusion and chaos and then we'll form a new nation by the American people, for the American people, and not working for a foreign government.
[01:44:29.058 --> 01:44:33.660]  And free from all that accumulated debt, we'll probably do very well for ourselves.
[01:44:35.193 --> 01:44:43.935]  Certainly, if you look at the Russian Republic today, financially, they've paid off all their debt, their economy is booming, and they're doing quite well.
[01:44:44.435 --> 01:45:03.819]  In this country, one of the things that is really working against a speedy rebound is that we've allowed so much of our manufacturing to go away and to go to foreign countries, and we've been losing manufacturing for 30 years, and it could take as long as 30 years to really get back world leadership in high-technology manufacturing.
[01:45:04.284 --> 01:45:12.536]  But it's a road that we're going to have to travel if we're ever going to get the respect and moral authority of this country back again.
[01:45:14.418 --> 01:45:15.139]  I agree with you.
[01:45:16.903 --> 01:45:18.604]  I want to go to some calls right now.
[01:45:18.724 --> 01:45:22.625]  Let's take calls, then we'll get into more of the election fraud as it begins to develop.
[01:45:22.645 --> 01:45:28.788]  We're going to get a little check-in from Vicki Karp with Austin Central Texas Vote Rescue, and Bev Harris joins us in the next hour.
[01:45:28.808 --> 01:45:33.150]  Right now, let's talk to Robert in California, then Chris, and many others.
[01:45:33.190 --> 01:45:33.790]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.730]  Yes.
[01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:35.570]  Good morning, sirs.
[01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:36.151]  How are you doing?
[01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:36.451]  Good.
[01:45:37.091 --> 01:45:37.791]  Okay.
[01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:39.092]  Just a little reporting.
[01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:41.833]  My boss called in, said she's going to be a little late.
[01:45:41.893 --> 01:45:43.394]  Now, she votes out in Riverside.
[01:45:44.844 --> 01:45:46.284]  They're having problems with their polls.
[01:45:46.685 --> 01:45:47.945]  Machines are breaking down.
[01:45:48.045 --> 01:45:48.725]  Yeah, everywhere.
[01:45:48.945 --> 01:45:51.566]  They're basically breaking down in every county, every city.
[01:45:52.246 --> 01:45:53.347]  Now, my other question is this.
[01:45:54.087 --> 01:45:57.888]  Over these last three elections, we have some facts and numbers.
[01:45:57.908 --> 01:46:05.611]  Is somebody going to put all this together showing that, you know, in hard facts, this fraud that's been going on?
[01:46:06.994 --> 01:46:11.376]  A congressman in Gore Vidal wrote a book detailing it for the 2004 election.
[01:46:11.396 --> 01:46:12.777]  The New York Times wouldn't review it.
[01:46:13.197 --> 01:46:17.658]  Detailed analysis have been done, proving that all the rules of voting have been broken.
[01:46:17.698 --> 01:46:23.981]  In the past, exit polls were very trustworthy, scientific polls were very trustworthy, between 2 and 3 percentage points.
[01:46:24.461 --> 01:46:34.305]  Now we see people who are anti-incumbent, anti-establishment, who are going to win by 10, 15 points, losing to establishment or incumbents, who are showing that they're going to lose.
[01:46:35.601 --> 01:46:38.744]  And this gets more and more pronounced each election cycle.
[01:46:39.404 --> 01:46:45.368]  And so we're just seeing an exact repeat, but even more pronounced than what we saw in the last three elections.
[01:46:45.428 --> 01:46:46.068]  Michael Rivera?
[01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:54.654]  Yeah, we're seeing this incredible disparity between what people seem to be talking about in the streets and the final official results.
[01:46:54.694 --> 01:47:04.400]  And of course, this year, they're not allowing any exit polls to get out early because they're afraid of leaks to blogs saying thus and so is winning in a particular contest.
[01:47:06.459 --> 01:47:17.988]  That's just the excuse, because what they're in effect doing is they're going to hold the exit polls until they know what the official results are supposed to be, so they can say, our exit polls show this, and by golly, weren't we accurate this year?
[01:47:18.509 --> 01:47:32.840]  But the reality is that we are going to see a lot of very questionable outcomes, and even if we don't look at the issue of the outcomes of who wins, with this many problems being reported across the country, people unable to vote, machines
[01:47:33.731 --> 01:47:41.955]  The bottom line is that this entire election is simply not credible because we don't know what the results really were.
[01:47:42.275 --> 01:47:51.339]  And every time we get one of these reports of election fraud, we will inevitably get the mainstream media saying, well yes, there was a problem, but it doesn't change the final outcome.
[01:47:51.759 --> 01:47:52.960]  How can they know?
[01:47:53.516 --> 01:48:02.238]  Because if you have one case of vote fraud you have discovered in a particular precinct, you cannot rule out the fact that there's other vote fraud you have completely missed.
[01:48:02.638 --> 01:48:07.619]  Therefore, you cannot state that the vote fraud you have discovered doesn't change the final outcome.
[01:48:07.739 --> 01:48:09.119]  It's an impossible statement to make.
[01:48:09.179 --> 01:48:19.581]  Well, plus, there's just the hubris we're witnessing where the people are against all the policies of globalization and the New World Order, but for the first time in modern history, the establishment just thumbs their nose and giggles.
[01:48:19.962 --> 01:48:21.962]  That shows that they're not worried about the voter.
[01:48:22.637 --> 01:48:35.728]  Yeah, they absolutely are not, and it's one of the reasons why all these anti-war protests and all these petitions that we've been doing for the last couple of years are completely ineffective, because in a country with honest elections,
[01:48:36.269 --> 01:48:43.652]  A politician would look out the window and every protest sign he saw and every name on a petition was a vote for his rival.
[01:48:43.952 --> 01:48:51.054]  And that's seen as, and by the way, a petition signature is seen as between 100 and 200 potential votes, just like any phone call is.
[01:48:51.435 --> 01:48:52.715]  Finish up what you wanted to say, Robert.
[01:48:53.395 --> 01:48:56.096]  Yeah, well, pretty much it's just like you said.
[01:48:56.656 --> 01:49:00.938]  They know the outcome because they say it so, and they're pretty, you know,
[01:49:01.763 --> 01:49:03.605]  Most of the news is pre-written anyway.
[01:49:03.745 --> 01:49:06.627]  It's like Mike always says, make a dictator act like a dictator.
[01:49:07.527 --> 01:49:09.129]  This is a losing game they're playing.
[01:49:09.749 --> 01:49:10.289]  Yes it is.
[01:49:10.409 --> 01:49:19.256]  And it's hard to see because my family has been in this country for way over 200 years on one side and the other half were waving the boats in on the first half.
[01:49:19.816 --> 01:49:23.839]  And it's hard to see this country just go down the hill.
[01:49:25.618 --> 01:49:26.719]  It is sad, my friend.
[01:49:26.779 --> 01:49:35.542]  Michael Rivero is our guest, giving us continual in-depth analysis of election fraud, New World Order, crime syndicate takeover 2006.
[01:49:35.642 --> 01:49:39.244]  We'll get a check-in here with Vicki Karp.
[01:49:39.284 --> 01:49:40.425]  Continue with your phone calls.
[01:49:40.985 --> 01:49:43.766]  Then, eight minutes in the next hour, Bev Harris will be joining us.
[01:49:43.846 --> 01:49:47.848]  She's the star of the new HBO special, Hacking Democracy.
[01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:49.108]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:49.168 --> 01:49:50.269]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:55.316 --> 01:49:55.756]  It's here!
[01:49:55.976 --> 01:50:00.759]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.119 --> 01:50:08.803]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.463 --> 01:50:16.527]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.927 --> 01:50:23.771]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:24.286 --> 01:50:28.327]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.647 --> 01:50:32.148]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.608 --> 01:50:34.509]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.869 --> 01:50:38.790]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:46.313]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:51:06.892 --> 01:51:18.415]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:51:18.795 --> 01:51:26.200]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for a flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[01:51:43.592 --> 01:51:44.512]  That's toll-free,
[01:51:48.715 --> 01:51:49.435]  We're good to go.
[01:52:11.025 --> 01:52:11.505]  I think so.
[01:52:28.114 --> 01:52:28.434]  I think so.
[01:52:52.743 --> 01:52:55.525]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:56.066 --> 01:52:59.408]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.630 --> 01:53:04.713]  We have America freedom to fascism in stock.
[01:53:04.813 --> 01:53:11.438]  You get it for $19.95, proving the Federal Reserve is private run for profit, hijacking our country, passing the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:53:12.159 --> 01:53:14.440]  Passing the Income Tax Act fraudulently.
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.301]  It gets into the whole control grid.
[01:53:16.441 --> 01:53:20.163]  Such an important film by the famous Hollywood director and producer Aaron Russo.
[01:53:20.503 --> 01:53:23.824]  You can get Terror Storm for $9.95 from Infowars.com.
[01:53:24.304 --> 01:53:32.368]  Lowest price you'll find it anywhere, even lower than Amazon.com, when you get it with American Freedom from Fascism, or by American Freedom from Fascism by itself if you wish.
[01:53:32.868 --> 01:53:38.152]  We're trying to drive TerrorStorm to number one on the Amazon video bestseller list.
[01:53:38.192 --> 01:53:39.113]  It's very important.
[01:53:39.473 --> 01:53:47.920]  It'll mean that distributors and suppliers and chains all over the country will make a big move to Terria in the front of their stores instead of hiding one or two copies in the back of every store.
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:54.290]  Please get TerrorStorm via Amazon.com and get America Freedom to Fascism, which is not available on Amazon.
[01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:58.877]  It's only available a few places and one of them is Infowars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:03.852 --> 01:54:04.752]  They can steal elections.
[01:54:04.792 --> 01:54:06.193]  They can pull all sorts of frauds.
[01:54:06.553 --> 01:54:08.774]  They can even try to shut down the Internet with Internet 2.
[01:54:09.315 --> 01:54:13.837]  But they cannot stop you from getting the DVD of Terror Storm and making copies of it.
[01:54:13.877 --> 01:54:15.317]  So please take action.
[01:54:15.357 --> 01:54:21.400]  Please go to InfoWars.com or JonesReport.com and it links directly to where you can get it at Amazon.com.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:25.962]  Mike, that's weird how Amazon changed the link we had to where it didn't go to the video.
[01:54:26.042 --> 01:54:27.103]  And I talked about Distributor.
[01:54:27.123 --> 01:54:27.923]  They never do that.
[01:54:29.113 --> 01:54:37.178]  Yeah, and well, I think what they're trying to do is simply they saw the huge number of hits coming in there and said, well, let's, you know, we don't have the DVD.
[01:54:37.198 --> 01:54:39.260]  Let's try and get these people to buy something different.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.583]  So I think it was taking unfair advantage of all the publicity that the terror storm was getting.
[01:54:44.903 --> 01:54:48.666]  And I'm not sure if it's actionable or not.
[01:54:48.686 --> 01:54:50.187]  You need to talk to a lawyer about that.
[01:54:50.207 --> 01:54:51.968]  But it's definitely, I think, unethical.
[01:54:52.678 --> 01:54:56.619]  They should have put the link simply to a page saying, we are in the process of getting new copies.
[01:54:56.939 --> 01:55:05.622]  Well, I mean, it takes two days for the regional warehouses to get it to them, and then normally all they do is say, you know, that it'll take a few extra days to get it.
[01:55:05.982 --> 01:55:07.943]  And they do have it now, by the way, folks.
[01:55:08.343 --> 01:55:10.223]  We're trying to make them change it to say they do.
[01:55:10.243 --> 01:55:11.484]  I mean, it's just sick!
[01:55:13.785 --> 01:55:15.105]  Look, it shows we're having an effect.
[01:55:16.337 --> 01:55:17.398]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:17.778 --> 01:55:23.461]  You know, anytime that you're over the target, you're going to be drawing flack, as some of my readers like to say.
[01:55:24.101 --> 01:55:32.665]  And when you see this kind of game playing going on, you need to look at the owners of the company in question and say, what is their political affiliation?
[01:55:32.725 --> 01:55:34.146]  What is their political agenda?
[01:55:34.646 --> 01:55:37.728]  Because one of the unfortunate aspects you will find is
[01:55:38.484 --> 01:55:50.309]  When you get to people who have very large amounts of money and they're not worried about making next month's mortgage payment, they start occupying themselves by saying, well, I'm going to reshape the world according to my particular set of beliefs.
[01:55:50.869 --> 01:55:56.091]  And very often we have seen in this society where people will use the companies they own
[01:55:56.590 --> 01:56:25.705]  to try and affect the world and we're not just talking mainstream media we're talking about companies like the PayPal scandal where PayPal just suddenly started freezing the accounts of websites like mine and saying we're going to hold on to your money for six months while we make sure that nothing illegal has been done and just inflicting minor irritations like that because of the political biases of the ownership of the company so if you're getting this kind of treatment it means as you say you're being effective
[01:56:26.621 --> 01:56:27.701]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:56:27.761 --> 01:56:30.902]  Chris in New Jersey, then Brad, Dave, or Brandy, Dave, and others.
[01:56:30.962 --> 01:56:32.402]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Chris.
[01:56:32.782 --> 01:56:34.342]  Hey, Alex, Mike, how you doing?
[01:56:34.482 --> 01:56:35.823]  Good, go ahead.
[01:56:36.023 --> 01:56:39.824]  I just wanted to report, I'm voting in the 5th District here in Warren County.
[01:56:41.244 --> 01:56:45.305]  I'd like to say that nothing happened out of the ordinary, which is great.
[01:56:45.945 --> 01:56:49.005]  You just went in and, now, did you vote on an old-fashioned machine or the new fancy?
[01:56:49.025 --> 01:56:49.745]  No, it was a touchscreen.
[01:56:49.765 --> 01:56:51.786]  It was a touchscreen, yeah.
[01:56:52.086 --> 01:56:52.886]  Everything went off great.
[01:56:53.718 --> 01:56:59.822]  Now, you have to understand though, just because it shows who you've really voted for, doesn't mean that's not manipulated inside the computer.
[01:56:59.842 --> 01:57:01.803]  Oh yeah, I understand that.
[01:57:01.823 --> 01:57:06.306]  The second point I wanted to bring up was a gentleman earlier talked about arming yourself.
[01:57:06.706 --> 01:57:06.926]  Yes.
[01:57:06.946 --> 01:57:08.587]  That's a good part about gun shows.
[01:57:08.647 --> 01:57:10.968]  That's probably the best place to buy any kind of things.
[01:57:10.988 --> 01:57:12.089]  You don't want to go to Walmart.
[01:57:12.129 --> 01:57:13.710]  You don't want to go to Cabela's.
[01:57:14.090 --> 01:57:16.031]  You want to send information right to the government.
[01:57:16.391 --> 01:57:16.712]  I agree.
[01:57:16.732 --> 01:57:18.573]  You want to do a private purchase
[01:57:19.193 --> 01:57:24.996]  You won't get as big a selection, but you can do a private purchase with the folks walking around with two or three guns in their hands, selling them.
[01:57:25.356 --> 01:57:27.276]  That is a gun that's totally untraceable.
[01:57:28.197 --> 01:57:29.117]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:57:29.137 --> 01:57:31.258]  Uh, no, just... Okay, thank you, thank you.
[01:57:32.139 --> 01:57:36.040]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.241]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:48.288 --> 01:57:52.391]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:53.973]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.693 --> 01:57:55.614]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.275 --> 01:57:59.917]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.438 --> 01:58:04.561]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.663 --> 01:58:10.726]  Already into our number three continual election coverage.
[01:58:11.747 --> 01:58:17.452]  We'll have even more news for you tomorrow that'll be a very important broadcast, because then we'll have
[01:58:18.815 --> 01:58:32.762]  The meat and potatoes evidence of what's been going on, but it's following all the same indicators we've seen in the past of massive concerted election fraud being conducted in key battleground congressional districts by the neocon forces and key senate races.
[01:58:33.262 --> 01:58:34.603]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:58:34.663 --> 01:58:36.724]  Michael Rivero riding shotgun with us in the shower.
[01:58:36.764 --> 01:58:38.304]  Bev Harris coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:39.065 --> 01:58:41.046]  Brad in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:58:41.086 --> 01:58:41.746]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:44.688 --> 01:58:47.690]  Brandy, I can't seem to read this right.
[01:58:47.730 --> 01:58:48.731]  Brandy, sorry, go ahead.
[01:58:49.551 --> 01:59:05.941]  Yeah, I was just calling to report that I thought that in 04, the election of 04, I was on the ground doing the Video Army, Video the Vote documentation, and because of all of this disenfranchisement in 04, I think that's affected the turnout of 06.
[01:59:06.301 --> 01:59:10.184]  I mean, yes, it was a presidential election, but I also feel that this election has been
[01:59:10.888 --> 01:59:21.667]  Publicize as being just as important in a lot of other ways and so I think a lot of people who would have voted if they'd felt their voices have been heard in Ohio in 2004 would have come out again this year and I don't think they're coming out for that.
[01:59:21.707 --> 01:59:23.671]  Yeah, you think people are giving up.
[01:59:24.238 --> 01:59:24.698]  Yeah, I do.
[01:59:24.758 --> 01:59:25.758]  I absolutely believe that.
[01:59:25.798 --> 01:59:33.781]  But I'll tell you, I mean, I haven't given up because I'm here talking to millions of people, but I'm not voting here in Travis County because I really believe there's no voting here.
[01:59:34.681 --> 01:59:36.881]  The county clerk, I've said she steals elections.
[01:59:36.921 --> 01:59:38.342]  She got caught in 98 doing it.
[01:59:38.382 --> 01:59:39.262]  It was even in the paper.
[01:59:39.802 --> 01:59:43.183]  Double counting ballot boxes, falsifying signatures, breaking safety seals.
[01:59:43.663 --> 01:59:47.244]  There were complaints to the state board and they said, well, she did all this, but it was an accident.
[01:59:47.844 --> 01:59:49.925]  That's kind of like robbing a bank is an accident.
[01:59:49.965 --> 01:59:50.625]  Michael Rivera,
[01:59:51.804 --> 01:59:59.890]  Yeah, the problem is the system as a whole because on the few times they catch somebody red-handed the investigations get stopped.
[02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:12.278]  There was a very good book written a few years back called Vote Scam by two brothers named Collier and this goes back to the pre-electronic machines and they uncovered massive vote fraud in Florida
[02:00:12.699 --> 02:00:21.946]  And they took all the evidence into the Secretary of State, who basically blocked any investigation at that point, and I believe that was Janet Reno at the time.
[02:00:22.287 --> 02:00:26.450]  So, the problem is, it's like the old saying about none dare call it treason.
[02:00:27.126 --> 02:00:34.632]  The government is not going to do anything about vote fraud, because everybody in the government, or most everybody in the government, got where they got by that vote fraud.
[02:00:34.652 --> 02:00:36.193]  So they're not going to do anything to change that.
[02:00:36.353 --> 02:00:38.214]  And I'm ashamed of the fact that I'm not voting.
[02:00:38.394 --> 02:00:44.759]  Even if it's a fraud, I should, to force them to flip it, so I can be involved in exit polls, which nobody ever seems to see.
[02:00:44.779 --> 02:00:47.080]  I mean, I think you should still vote, folks.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.943]  I'm just so busy fighting the new world order that... And I do vote sometimes.
[02:00:51.163 --> 02:00:52.464]  I just... Who knows?
[02:00:52.504 --> 02:00:53.625]  Maybe I will go vote today.
[02:00:53.685 --> 02:00:54.666]  Maybe I've still got time.
[02:00:55.246 --> 02:00:59.247]  I'm just going to be so busy researching the election fraud that when I get off air, I write articles about it.
[02:01:00.428 --> 02:01:01.648]  Mike, are you voting?
[02:01:02.508 --> 02:01:08.330]  Yes, absolutely, because first of all, there may not be somebody I want to vote for, but there's always somebody I want to vote against.
[02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:12.071]  And second, I'm just going to make those vote riggers work that much harder.
[02:01:13.211 --> 02:01:13.771]  Absolutely.
[02:01:13.791 --> 02:01:14.852]  You know, it is important to vote.
[02:01:14.872 --> 02:01:17.052]  In fact, I need to go vote.
[02:01:17.932 --> 02:01:19.593]  Okay, anything else, Brandy?
[02:01:20.583 --> 02:01:25.232]  I just wanted to thank you for getting the information out to as many people as you can.
[02:01:25.993 --> 02:01:31.945]  Your program is a diamond in the rough and it's very important that a lot of people get to hear this information because they can't hear it anywhere else.
[02:01:33.208 --> 02:01:33.768]  Well, thank you.
[02:01:33.808 --> 02:01:36.530]  I'd rather hear that I'm a diamond, but I'll take diamond in the rough.
[02:01:37.371 --> 02:01:39.412]  I probably am a diamond in the rough.
[02:01:39.933 --> 02:01:42.775]  Okay, thank you so much for your comments, Brandy.
[02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:45.417]  We'll break and come back with Bev Harrison and get to more of your calls.
[02:01:45.777 --> 02:01:50.640]  Toll-free number to report on what you're seeing locally in your precinct, your area, your congressional district, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:50.700]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:53.622]  If you ever miss that number, it's posted on GCN Live.
[02:01:59.426 --> 02:02:02.287]  Michael Rivera will be riding shotgun with us through the rest of this hour.
[02:02:03.048 --> 02:02:12.591]  55 minutes left, but it is important to get out there and take part in the process, just so you can witness what's happening, just so you can report back to what you saw.
[02:02:12.631 --> 02:02:14.592]  It's very important to be involved in exit polls.
[02:02:15.012 --> 02:02:17.653]  It's very important to volunteer for the elections.
[02:02:18.113 --> 02:02:22.795]  You know, I saw Pat Buchanan winning, I have to say, 60% of the vote in the Republican primary in 1996.
[02:02:23.755 --> 02:02:27.216]  But then that night, he only got 8% of the vote in Travis County.
[02:02:27.997 --> 02:02:28.517]  And I saw it.
[02:02:29.168 --> 02:02:29.970]  I saw the ballots.
[02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:30.611]  I read them.
[02:02:30.691 --> 02:02:31.151]  I looked at them.
[02:02:31.212 --> 02:02:32.474]  I talked to others who were looking at them.
[02:02:32.974 --> 02:02:37.562]  So I've actually publicly, you know, announced that I think Dana DuBois steals elections.
[02:02:38.143 --> 02:02:39.705]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:02:40.166 --> 02:02:40.586]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.006 --> 02:02:47.446]  It's here!
[02:02:47.666 --> 02:02:52.408]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.808 --> 02:03:00.490]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.170 --> 02:03:08.213]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.613 --> 02:03:15.475]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:15.976 --> 02:03:20.017]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.337 --> 02:03:23.818]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.298 --> 02:03:26.179]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.559 --> 02:03:30.480]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:56.357 --> 02:04:58.418]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism
[02:05:14.462 --> 02:05:14.942]  We're good to go.
[02:05:48.465 --> 02:05:49.085]  Big Brother.
[02:05:49.765 --> 02:05:50.825]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:51.526 --> 02:05:52.646]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:53.306 --> 02:05:54.106]  You want answers?
[02:05:54.867 --> 02:05:55.707]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.407 --> 02:06:00.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.608 --> 02:06:04.730]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.970 --> 02:06:10.631]  Alright, Beth Harris is not doing any radio interviews today, but she decided to come on this broadcast.
[02:06:10.691 --> 02:06:11.332]  I'm very honored.
[02:06:11.352 --> 02:06:12.672]  I know she's a very busy lady.
[02:06:14.446 --> 02:06:16.527]  The new HBO film debuted last Thursday.
[02:06:16.547 --> 02:06:17.648]  It's aired several times.
[02:06:17.968 --> 02:06:19.989]  I haven't had a chance to watch it on the web.
[02:06:20.009 --> 02:06:21.790]  You can see it at JonesReport.com.
[02:06:21.810 --> 02:06:23.931]  We have a link to the Google video.
[02:06:25.211 --> 02:06:26.452]  Hacking Democracy.
[02:06:27.292 --> 02:06:32.635]  The voting machine documentary Diebold didn't want you to see is the article we wrote about this yesterday.
[02:06:32.675 --> 02:06:34.396]  Erin Dykes did a great job writing.
[02:06:34.416 --> 02:06:36.677]  Shotgun with us is Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:06:36.717 --> 02:06:37.898]  He'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:06:38.278 --> 02:06:40.099]  Beth will be with us until the end of this segment.
[02:06:40.119 --> 02:06:41.239]  She's got to get on her cell phone.
[02:06:41.259 --> 02:06:42.260]  She drives downtown.
[02:06:43.432 --> 02:06:45.854]  And she'll be on via cell phone with us until about 45 after.
[02:06:45.874 --> 02:06:48.495]  We'll also be taking your calls in between.
[02:06:49.275 --> 02:06:50.676]  Bev Harris, thank you for coming on.
[02:06:51.276 --> 02:06:53.238]  Well, you know, I'd always come here for you, Alex.
[02:06:53.638 --> 02:06:54.378]  Oh, you're so nice.
[02:06:55.259 --> 02:07:02.803]  I want to get into the new film and the great effect it had, but before we do that, you've been analyzing what's coming in preliminary.
[02:07:03.183 --> 02:07:05.924]  The Republicans are running around telling us, don't listen to exit polls!
[02:07:05.944 --> 02:07:08.566]  They've always been right in the past, but ignore them!
[02:07:09.126 --> 02:07:12.328]  And, oh, the rain's going to keep the Democrats out, so we see them pre-spinning
[02:07:13.008 --> 02:07:18.593]  I think ahead of stealing the election, or at least trying to block a total landslide for the Democrats.
[02:07:18.633 --> 02:07:19.673]  And again, I hate the Democrats.
[02:07:19.733 --> 02:07:20.414]  I'm nonpartisan.
[02:07:20.434 --> 02:07:21.495]  I used to be a big Republican.
[02:07:21.835 --> 02:07:24.457]  It's just clearly the Republicans are predominantly the ones stealing.
[02:07:24.797 --> 02:07:27.079]  We know some Democrats are, from your great analysis and others.
[02:07:27.119 --> 02:07:29.341]  But give us an overview of what you see coming in today.
[02:07:29.961 --> 02:07:31.863]  Oh man, you know, it is really scary.
[02:07:31.883 --> 02:07:35.305]  There's some stuff that's just... They're not even being sneaky about it now.
[02:07:36.106 --> 02:07:38.908]  Cuyahoga County, again, that's Cleveland.
[02:07:38.968 --> 02:07:41.370]  It was the one in the film that was always having problems.
[02:07:42.367 --> 02:07:47.330]  I'm sorry, they're doing things that there's no legitimate explanation for that I can think of.
[02:07:47.630 --> 02:08:01.258]  For example, they're saying, at the polling place, they're not allowed to give the results out, or look at the results at the polling place, or tell anyone the results, or write them down.
[02:08:02.375 --> 02:08:06.861]  Now, what legitimate reason is there to hide the results at the polling place?
[02:08:07.282 --> 02:08:08.623]  Well, they've already removed the paper.
[02:08:08.704 --> 02:08:10.566]  They've already removed the power to recount.
[02:08:10.606 --> 02:08:13.790]  It's to ensure that fraud can be done in the dark.
[02:08:14.071 --> 02:08:15.032]  Well, there you go.
[02:08:15.092 --> 02:08:20.039]  Because it's really important to compare what happens at the polling place with what shows up at headquarters.
[02:08:20.652 --> 02:08:26.836]  You know, so in other words, they're going to transport it all to headquarters and only then, when they release it, can people see.
[02:08:26.876 --> 02:08:27.577]  That's crazy.
[02:08:27.597 --> 02:08:29.878]  In the past, there was always precinct reporting.
[02:08:30.078 --> 02:08:33.400]  That's how they caught them in election fraud two months ago in Mexico.
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:34.241]  Right, right.
[02:08:34.341 --> 02:08:36.622]  Precinct reporting is a key check and balance.
[02:08:37.163 --> 02:08:41.325]  And they're having to go through all kinds of problems to get that in most of the country, but it gets worse.
[02:08:41.826 --> 02:08:48.270]  Victoria Lovgren, she runs Ohio Vigilance, it's an organization.
[02:08:48.877 --> 02:08:55.823]  She called up, she didn't know, you know, she called up some of the people working at the polls and said, why don't you jot down the results there so that we can compare them.
[02:08:56.363 --> 02:09:01.147]  And she is being brought up on criminal charges today for doing that, for interfering with an election.
[02:09:01.828 --> 02:09:07.633]  So now, something that was always done, what the press always did in this country, the neocons are saying it's illegal.
[02:09:08.193 --> 02:09:08.393]  Right.
[02:09:09.154 --> 02:09:10.535]  I mean, this is shocking.
[02:09:10.655 --> 02:09:14.378]  And then I'm getting reports out of Los Angeles that are just ridiculous.
[02:09:15.059 --> 02:09:17.681]  In Beverly Hills, of all places.
[02:09:18.383 --> 02:09:24.046]  They've got, you know, they go to vote, there's nobody there 15 minutes after the polls are supposed to open.
[02:09:24.066 --> 02:09:26.848]  There's nobody there 45 minutes after they're supposed to open.
[02:09:27.328 --> 02:09:34.572]  Then they're given a ballot and somebody says, well, we'll just mark a green pen line through this so that we'll know what precinct you're supposed to be in.
[02:09:34.592 --> 02:09:36.853]  Of course, that invalidates it with the optical scan.
[02:09:37.394 --> 02:09:41.176]  And then one of the poll workers says, well, no, don't do that because that'll invalidate it.
[02:09:41.196 --> 02:09:43.097]  The guy comes over and says, shh, don't tell him that.
[02:09:43.838 --> 02:09:46.882]  I mean, you're at the tip of the spear.
[02:09:46.902 --> 02:09:48.684]  You're getting reports in from all over the country.
[02:09:48.724 --> 02:09:49.666]  Oh, these are bad.
[02:09:49.686 --> 02:09:58.436]  In neighboring Hollywood precinct, people are told every time they put their ballot in that it gets kicked back out because it's no good, no matter how many times they try to do the ballot.
[02:10:00.194 --> 02:10:03.998]  Okay, you did it three times, it kicked it out three times, too bad, so sad, go home.
[02:10:04.098 --> 02:10:07.822]  And it's not just one person, at the same time other people this is happening to.
[02:10:07.862 --> 02:10:10.945]  So now they're just not allowing people to vote and keeping it closed.
[02:10:10.965 --> 02:10:14.908]  We've got in Ohio, in Indiana, the polls are closed.
[02:10:15.029 --> 02:10:21.335]  Oh my gosh, Indiana, tell me how this happens, that every single voting machine in an entire county decides to go on the fritz at once.
[02:10:22.596 --> 02:10:23.237]  I mean, you know...
[02:10:24.692 --> 02:10:25.633]  I just have a question.
[02:10:25.673 --> 02:10:28.974]  I don't see that happening too often in an entire county.
[02:10:28.994 --> 02:10:31.995]  You can't even get all the traffic lights to go out in an entire county at once.
[02:10:32.315 --> 02:10:36.236]  Bev Harris, continue please with the other info you've got.
[02:10:36.376 --> 02:10:39.978]  I mean, we're here trying to track the news right now as it pours in.
[02:10:40.258 --> 02:10:43.019]  We're posting it all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:43.039 --> 02:10:45.620]  I know at BlackBoxVoting.org you are as well.
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:48.901]  I mean, this is like trying to drink out of a fire hose set on high.
[02:10:49.460 --> 02:10:58.844]  Well, I'll tell you what, I'm not posting a lot of what I'm getting in, because I'm going to be doing some special things with it afterwards, but there may be some surprises coming down the pike here.
[02:10:58.864 --> 02:11:02.066]  But I will tell you that let's even now look ahead to what we should expect.
[02:11:02.106 --> 02:11:03.946]  Well, let us in, let us in for a moment.
[02:11:04.226 --> 02:11:06.147]  Well, hold on, let us in on some of the surprises.
[02:11:06.748 --> 02:11:16.692]  Well, you know, the real... Oh, well, you know, I've been getting a lot of interesting reports that are very diagnostic, and I know exactly the serial numbers of the machines that happened with.
[02:11:17.210 --> 02:11:27.253]  And so, in the public records request this time, we're going to be able to compare what they give us with very specific information with dates, times, and serial numbers of the machines.
[02:11:27.433 --> 02:11:29.254]  That way they don't just give you some other machine.
[02:11:29.554 --> 02:11:32.935]  Oh yeah, and it better match, because they don't know which ones we have the photographs of.
[02:11:34.615 --> 02:11:40.157]  But, you know, this is the tip of the iceberg, because I'll tell you what, when the polls close is when the fun really begins.
[02:11:41.197 --> 02:11:43.878]  And we're going to see tonight around the country
[02:11:44.594 --> 02:11:45.935]  Uh, memory cards go missing.
[02:11:45.995 --> 02:11:47.676]  Remember, those are the ballot boxes.
[02:11:48.216 --> 02:11:53.139]  In Cleveland, in the primary election this year, 70 of those went missing.
[02:11:53.942 --> 02:12:02.064]  How many times with hand-counted paper ballots did we hear of 70 ballot boxes going missing, and they never did account for them, and people go, oh well, it's a glitch.
[02:12:02.144 --> 02:12:05.085]  Yeah, I mean, LBJ got caught red-handed just stealing one ballot.
[02:12:05.105 --> 02:12:05.985]  Yeah, I know!
[02:12:06.005 --> 02:12:07.465]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:12:07.805 --> 02:12:08.846]  But we're going to see that again.
[02:12:08.886 --> 02:12:13.027]  We see it in every election, where these memory cards, P.E.B.s, what have you, go missing.
[02:12:13.367 --> 02:12:16.488]  We're going to see more votes than voters, again.
[02:12:16.988 --> 02:12:18.028]  It happens every election.
[02:12:18.993 --> 02:12:29.296]  One thing you want to watch for, if you've got a county elections division that's putting results up as they go, is we saw in Memphis, Tennessee, the vote totals going down as the precinct count went up.
[02:12:30.476 --> 02:12:31.157]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:31.197 --> 02:12:32.937]  What area of Tennessee was that?
[02:12:32.957 --> 02:12:34.057]  That was Memphis.
[02:12:35.118 --> 02:12:35.698]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:35.718 --> 02:12:39.339]  I want to bring Michael Rivero in, who's one of our analysts here today.
[02:12:39.719 --> 02:12:42.800]  Mike, I know you've probably got some important questions that I haven't raised for Bev Harris.
[02:12:44.230 --> 02:12:46.614]  Well, actually what I have is a comment.
[02:12:46.654 --> 02:12:56.708]  First of all, Bev, my congratulations and sincere respect and admiration for blackboxvoting.org and I link to your site on a regular basis and try and send some traffic.
[02:12:58.123 --> 02:13:07.747]  Getting back to Hacking Democracy, HBO is running it a very great amount of times today, and I just put a link at my site going to HBO's schedule.
[02:13:07.827 --> 02:13:10.067]  So if people haven't seen it, they can get in.
[02:13:10.368 --> 02:13:11.788]  It is a wonderful documentary.
[02:13:11.868 --> 02:13:14.109]  I can understand why Diebold was upset about it.
[02:13:15.435 --> 02:13:18.576]  And yes, when the polls close tonight is when the fun is going to begin.
[02:13:18.656 --> 02:13:18.977]  That's right.
[02:13:18.997 --> 02:13:21.158]  Tomorrow is going to be the really important broadcast, folks.
[02:13:21.238 --> 02:13:23.980]  Be sure and join us, Bob, and maybe Bev Harris can pop in then again.
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:29.063]  Bev, talking about the film, they really tried to block its release, so they wanted a disclaimer.
[02:13:29.203 --> 02:13:33.645]  HBO, home box office, told them to take a hike or go fly a kite.
[02:13:34.866 --> 02:13:37.167]  Give us any inside intel.
[02:13:37.668 --> 02:13:40.149]  You're one of the prime movers behind the film, one of the central people in the film.
[02:13:40.449 --> 02:13:43.111]  Tell us about some of their attempts to block its release.
[02:13:43.391 --> 02:13:46.032]  Oh yeah, well HBO is one of the American heroes in this too.
[02:13:46.072 --> 02:13:49.493]  Remember, this was a dangerous film that no one wanted to air.
[02:13:49.533 --> 02:13:51.714]  There were multiple attempts to kill this film.
[02:13:52.214 --> 02:13:55.775]  And it was made by a couple of independent filmmakers out of Great Britain.
[02:13:55.795 --> 02:13:57.375]  They had no money, no financing.
[02:13:57.856 --> 02:14:02.437]  And HBO stepped in and said, we believe in this film and we are going to air it.
[02:14:02.924 --> 02:14:04.345]  And they stood up to Diebold.
[02:14:04.385 --> 02:14:05.245]  Diebold, get this.
[02:14:05.346 --> 02:14:09.888]  They send in their lawyers and demand that HBO pull it from the schedule.
[02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:13.350]  They list this whole list of supposed factual errors.
[02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:15.992]  Then it turns out that none of those things were even in the film.
[02:14:16.072 --> 02:14:16.993]  It was straw men.
[02:14:17.173 --> 02:14:19.034]  So it was straw men.
[02:14:19.554 --> 02:14:20.295]  Yeah.
[02:14:20.375 --> 02:14:22.416]  And then they managed to get press.
[02:14:22.856 --> 02:14:28.379]  The press that doesn't check anything dutifully reports that the film is full of errors.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.521]  It turns out nothing that they reported was even in the film.
[02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:39.093]  But this is the kind of games that are played by... Yeah, they built Trump and Popular Mechanics did that to me and others.
[02:14:39.733 --> 02:14:41.614]  They claim that I said things I never said.
[02:14:42.014 --> 02:14:42.194]  Right.
[02:14:42.534 --> 02:14:46.376]  And it's so frustrating because they get depressed for the thing that you never said.
[02:14:46.476 --> 02:14:47.416]  But here's the deal, Bev.
[02:14:47.576 --> 02:14:48.797]  They don't have any credibility.
[02:14:48.897 --> 02:14:51.478]  Newspaper circulation is rocketing downwards.
[02:14:51.638 --> 02:14:53.359]  Our credibility is exploding.
[02:14:53.399 --> 02:14:58.861]  You and I, when I first started interviewing you, what, five years ago, I've been covering this for over ten years,
[02:14:59.281 --> 02:15:02.382]  You were a corporate crime investigator when you started investigating it.
[02:15:02.742 --> 02:15:04.042]  Most people thought we were nuts.
[02:15:04.062 --> 02:15:08.803]  Now in major polls, 90 plus percent believe there's election fraud being orchestrated from the highest levels.
[02:15:08.823 --> 02:15:09.483]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:15:09.823 --> 02:15:17.724]  I mean, you know the thing is, when there is a power grab, the thing that always knocks them down is they underestimate the people.
[02:15:18.384 --> 02:15:20.425]  They think people are dumb, and guess what?
[02:15:20.485 --> 02:15:21.525]  People are not dumb.
[02:15:21.565 --> 02:15:23.925]  They have amazing creativity and common sense.
[02:15:25.386 --> 02:15:26.366]  Absolutely.
[02:15:26.806 --> 02:15:27.886]  I'm sorry, go ahead Mike.
[02:15:28.658 --> 02:15:47.982]  Yeah, I wanted to insert a comment here about getting the mainstream media, the TV news networks, and newspapers to objectively report on hacking democracy is really impractical, because if you think about it, they are the owners of the Voters News Service, or whatever they're calling themselves this year, so they've got a hidden agenda at work there.
[02:15:48.002 --> 02:15:52.643]  They're not going to want to talk about anything that points out voter fraud, because they're part of the problem.
[02:15:52.683 --> 02:15:53.083]  That's right.
[02:15:53.163 --> 02:15:57.604]  In fact, Bev Harris, tell folks about the new incarnation of Voter News Services.
[02:15:58.755 --> 02:16:02.139]  Well, you know, I'm not sure there is an incarnation.
[02:16:02.179 --> 02:16:09.828]  They tried to turn it over to Battelle Memorial Labs for a while, and then they bailed out because they, I don't know, they flubbed the 2002 election.
[02:16:09.868 --> 02:16:14.253]  These are just secretive groups that tell us what the results are and it's always proven to be a fraud.
[02:16:14.533 --> 02:16:17.036]  Yeah, it's like, why do people just think that
[02:16:17.316 --> 02:16:20.619]  Because someone says it, that it's true, but they keep doing it.
[02:16:20.719 --> 02:16:29.307]  Actually, it's kind of funny now, because you watch it with the Democrats and the Republicans, and they go, well, the Democratic poll says they're going to win, and the Republicans go, no, our special members say we are.
[02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:31.689]  And you think, well, why does anybody believe anything?
[02:16:31.849 --> 02:16:33.831]  And the press doesn't ask where Roe gets the numbers.
[02:16:33.931 --> 02:16:36.133]  NPR finally did, and he said they were secret.
[02:16:38.595 --> 02:16:41.435]  Well, so that could mean anything, couldn't it?
[02:16:41.695 --> 02:16:46.297]  In other words, it could be a cover story for you're going to do something bad at the polls, which really is happening to you.
[02:16:46.337 --> 02:16:47.197]  This is no joke.
[02:16:47.257 --> 02:16:49.398]  I'm getting really sick of these guys.
[02:16:49.818 --> 02:16:57.860]  Bev, what do you think about the pre-spin that the rain's going to keep Democrats from voting or third parties, and that don't listen to exit polls, they're not accurate?
[02:16:58.641 --> 02:17:03.322]  Well, there's pre-spin on the whole business, and then there's post-spin.
[02:17:03.762 --> 02:17:05.983]  And I think we have to, as citizens,
[02:17:06.894 --> 02:17:13.636]  Look for the fact, and separate the wheat from the chaff, and just, you know, tune this stuff out.
[02:17:14.036 --> 02:17:15.156]  Look at it like advertising.
[02:17:15.196 --> 02:17:22.278]  Bottom line, they're saying, just trust us, let us use secret machines, when their own engineers have quit and gone public saying they were hired to run frauds.
[02:17:22.898 --> 02:17:29.080]  Right, I mean, just trust us is what you do in a communist or fascist country, not in a republic like we have.
[02:17:29.793 --> 02:17:32.055]  Bev Harris, Michael Rivero, stay with us.
[02:17:32.116 --> 02:17:39.103]  We'll reconnect with Bev during this break right now via her cell phone and talk to her as she multitasks driving downtown to do some business.
[02:17:39.403 --> 02:17:40.024]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:44.902]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:44.982 --> 02:17:49.765]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:17:49.925 --> 02:17:57.748]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:17:57.988 --> 02:18:03.371]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:03.571 --> 02:18:10.554]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:18:10.854 --> 02:18:16.201]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:18:16.441 --> 02:18:21.188]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:18:21.528 --> 02:18:29.118]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:18:29.458 --> 02:18:35.702]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:18:36.022 --> 02:18:37.664]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.944 --> 02:18:40.445]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:40.565 --> 02:18:51.853]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[02:18:52.653 --> 02:18:57.617]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[02:18:58.337 --> 02:19:04.324]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[02:19:05.025 --> 02:19:13.455]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.
[02:19:14.196 --> 02:19:21.884]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[02:19:42.003 --> 02:19:47.087]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:47.147 --> 02:19:54.434]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:19:54.594 --> 02:20:05.221]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:20:05.421 --> 02:20:10.004]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:10.264 --> 02:20:15.227]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:20:15.467 --> 02:20:18.389]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:18.629 --> 02:20:28.476]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:20:35.861 --> 02:20:37.322]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:20:45.496 --> 02:20:48.797]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:20:49.177 --> 02:20:52.138]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:20:52.399 --> 02:20:58.761]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:20:58.841 --> 02:21:03.262]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:21:03.502 --> 02:21:07.844]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:21:08.004 --> 02:21:13.386]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of US debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:21:13.866 --> 02:21:16.408]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:21:16.448 --> 02:21:20.710]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:21.631]  Treasury bonds.
[02:21:21.891 --> 02:21:26.514]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:21:26.694 --> 02:21:28.335]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:21:28.355 --> 02:21:29.936]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:21:53.152 --> 02:21:56.834]  Michael Rivero, Bud Harris with us.
[02:21:57.054 --> 02:21:58.135]  Dave in Minnesota.
[02:21:59.255 --> 02:22:01.717]  Welcome to the airwave, sir, during election fraud 2006.
[02:22:01.777 --> 02:22:02.097]  Hey, everyone.
[02:22:05.666 --> 02:22:18.433]  Um, I just want to say that, you know, we really need to get everyone out there to vote, and while they're voting, even if, like, we're having problems with the polls, people need to take pictures with their cell phones, people need to record this stuff, and, like, demand the right to vote.
[02:22:18.933 --> 02:22:21.174]  There's no way we can hold them accountable if we have no evidence.
[02:22:21.621 --> 02:22:23.002]  Hold them accountable after your election.
[02:22:23.202 --> 02:22:25.343]  Everyone just really needs to go out there and vote.
[02:22:25.364 --> 02:22:27.325]  Sure, more evidence is needed, but we've already caught them.
[02:22:27.345 --> 02:22:32.408]  It's like if you've caught somebody with five dead bodies, and you think they're the suspect in the next killing.
[02:22:32.448 --> 02:22:34.129]  I mean, we've caught them.
[02:22:34.149 --> 02:22:36.091]  Now it's about educating people about the fraud.
[02:22:36.611 --> 02:22:40.313]  People are now watching and listening, and they're seeing fraud on a massive scale today.
[02:22:40.373 --> 02:22:41.094]  Michael Rivero?
[02:22:42.175 --> 02:22:43.235]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:43.455 --> 02:22:47.318]  The fraud is an established fact, especially through Beth Harris's website.
[02:22:47.734 --> 02:22:54.878]  We need to educate the American people that it's happening, and more to the point, we need to educate them that they need to do something about it.
[02:22:54.938 --> 02:23:00.981]  They can't sit there and wait for somebody to come and fix the problem for them, and obviously they can't vote the problem away.
[02:23:01.661 --> 02:23:06.924]  And it's going to take activism, it's going to take direct action to get our voting system back under control.
[02:23:08.621 --> 02:23:12.784]  That's something a lot of Americans don't want to hear, but that's, you know, what has to happen next.
[02:23:12.864 --> 02:23:23.492]  And we've already left the hurdle of getting people to believe and be educated and informed with the facts that there is orchestrated election fraud by the big four companies and others right now.
[02:23:23.512 --> 02:23:24.973]  Go ahead and finish up, Dave.
[02:23:24.993 --> 02:23:26.113]  I'm going to go back to Beth Harris.
[02:23:26.594 --> 02:23:31.978]  Yeah, I just wanted to tell everyone who finds problems, please report to CNN, even if they aren't reporting it and they're saying they're going to.
[02:23:31.998 --> 02:23:34.579]  And yeah, that's pretty much it.
[02:23:34.659 --> 02:23:35.120]  I mean,
[02:23:36.226 --> 02:23:36.746]  Go vote!
[02:23:37.327 --> 02:23:37.727]  Thank you.
[02:23:38.588 --> 02:23:43.571]  You should also not just report to Mainstream Outlets, you should call into radio talk shows and talk about what happened to you.
[02:23:43.611 --> 02:23:44.812]  Not just this one, but other ones.
[02:23:45.373 --> 02:23:48.335]  Neocon, liberal, you know, freedom, it doesn't matter.
[02:23:48.635 --> 02:23:52.858]  You should also report to Bev Harris and Vote Rescue in Austin and form your own group.
[02:23:52.898 --> 02:23:54.699]  You know, do what Vicki Karp did here in Austin.
[02:23:55.019 --> 02:24:02.185]  Bev Harris, how important is it for people to not see you or me or Mike as the leaders, but for them to go out and form their own groups?
[02:24:02.725 --> 02:24:04.086]  I'm so glad to hear that.
[02:24:04.690 --> 02:24:06.331]  Because that is exactly it.
[02:24:06.372 --> 02:24:08.473]  We can't wait for someone else to do it.
[02:24:08.493 --> 02:24:10.155]  This is too big of a problem.
[02:24:10.555 --> 02:24:11.316]  It's systemic.
[02:24:12.157 --> 02:24:15.580]  And it's unrealistic to think that any one person can fix it.
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:20.724]  And if they could, that would be dangerous, because all you'd have to do is get rid of that one person.
[02:24:21.665 --> 02:24:26.870]  Well, we have, exactly, we have the cat out of the bag of orchestrated fraud going on by this criminal elite.
[02:24:27.997 --> 02:24:29.638]  Their hubris shows they're just going to go.
[02:24:29.738 --> 02:24:31.119]  People say, well, will they steal it again?
[02:24:31.139 --> 02:24:32.599]  Well, of course, that's why they're in control.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:39.523]  Where do you see this collision as the people wake up and the establishment just doesn't give a rat's behind?
[02:24:40.043 --> 02:24:44.445]  What do you see happening in that titanic, colossal, juggernauts colliding?
[02:24:45.446 --> 02:24:53.309]  Well, one of the secret weapons we have in the toolkit that we have online, we have a citizen toolkit at blackboxvoting.org.
[02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:54.430]  What we know
[02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:58.261]  That toolkit shows people how to engage with their government.
[02:24:58.821 --> 02:25:01.603]  But what we know is they're going to hit a brick wall.
[02:25:02.664 --> 02:25:10.369]  That's the hidden part of that toolkit, is they're going to try to step out and discover just how much control they've lost.
[02:25:10.749 --> 02:25:14.392]  They're going to see the guiltiness and the corruption and the threats.
[02:25:14.432 --> 02:25:16.093]  They're going to find out what we've learned.
[02:25:16.593 --> 02:25:16.833]  Yeah.
[02:25:17.894 --> 02:25:20.055]  And you know, sometimes you just can't tell people.
[02:25:20.135 --> 02:25:20.796]  I'm like that.
[02:25:20.816 --> 02:25:22.517]  Someone tells me and it's like, show me.
[02:25:23.901 --> 02:25:25.242]  You've got to be baptized in it.
[02:25:25.302 --> 02:25:26.042]  That's a key point.
[02:25:26.062 --> 02:25:33.606]  You need to become veterans of the fight, whether it's for land rights, the Second Amendment, the borders, the electronic voting machines, the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:25:34.126 --> 02:25:34.666]  That's a key.
[02:25:34.726 --> 02:25:36.647]  Mike, you want to comment on what she just raised?
[02:25:37.768 --> 02:25:42.930]  Yeah, we're basically at a point in time where we need more citizen activists.
[02:25:43.571 --> 02:25:46.732]  And everyone says, well, you know, who's going to fix all this thing?
[02:25:46.772 --> 02:25:47.412]  I say, you are.
[02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:48.793]  You're going to have to fix it.
[02:25:49.355 --> 02:25:51.216]  Yeah, there's no Lone Ranger coming.
[02:25:51.597 --> 02:25:54.819]  Batman is just a fictional character.
[02:25:54.899 --> 02:25:56.780]  Superman's a guy in a tight costume.
[02:25:57.041 --> 02:25:58.402]  There are no heroes coming.
[02:25:58.522 --> 02:26:01.564]  If you're going to make the world a better place, you have to do it.
[02:26:02.264 --> 02:26:03.265]  You have to start today.
[02:26:03.305 --> 02:26:04.886]  Yeah, change starts in the mirror.
[02:26:06.568 --> 02:26:06.728]  Right.
[02:26:07.526 --> 02:26:09.347]  You know, he hit it on the head.
[02:26:09.407 --> 02:26:09.867]  I like that.
[02:26:09.908 --> 02:26:11.408]  I'm going to steal his little quote.
[02:26:13.970 --> 02:26:15.451]  Well, you are welcome to it.
[02:26:15.491 --> 02:26:16.432]  You don't have to steal it.
[02:26:16.472 --> 02:26:16.972]  It's all yours.
[02:26:17.352 --> 02:26:18.853]  Well, that's where change starts.
[02:26:19.213 --> 02:26:22.315]  And again, we've left the big hurdle here.
[02:26:22.435 --> 02:26:29.700]  The most 90 plus percent in major polls, some are 95, some are 92, some are 91, show people don't believe these machines.
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:33.122]  I mean, we've won the battle at waking people up.
[02:26:33.142 --> 02:26:34.783]  Now, how do we get these zombies moving?
[02:26:35.330 --> 02:26:36.670]  Yeah, and we have to be careful.
[02:26:36.930 --> 02:26:40.131]  You can't wave a magic democrat over it, you know?
[02:26:40.431 --> 02:26:44.733]  You can't pass a special legislative package and just make it better.
[02:26:44.753 --> 02:26:48.874]  This, the missing ingredient, is citizens!
[02:26:49.774 --> 02:26:52.195]  You have to oversee your own government, folks!
[02:26:53.535 --> 02:27:04.578]  Well that's really it, and it's also an indicator of just how corrupt this current elite oligarchy is, that they've got the chutzpah, the nerve, the will to engage in orchestrated massive frauds.
[02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:06.129]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:06.149 --> 02:27:08.431]  They don't even try to hide it sometimes, you know.
[02:27:10.492 --> 02:27:10.692]  Yup.
[02:27:11.073 --> 02:27:14.235]  It's their hubris that's gonna undo them and they're underestimating the people.
[02:27:14.275 --> 02:27:15.615]  Final segment with Beth Harris.
[02:27:15.936 --> 02:27:17.136]  Warrior call straight ahead.
[02:27:17.176 --> 02:27:19.218]  Michael Rivero going through the bitter end with us.
[02:27:19.658 --> 02:27:20.419]  Stay the course.
[02:27:20.459 --> 02:27:23.280]  We got 30 minutes left in this Election Day coverage.
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:25.462]  A lot of coverage tomorrow as well.
[02:27:26.022 --> 02:27:28.804]  You'll wanna be sure and keep it locked into this same station.
[02:27:29.184 --> 02:27:29.805]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:34.244 --> 02:27:37.228]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:40.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.164 --> 02:27:50.289]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:50.509 --> 02:27:52.271]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:52.551 --> 02:27:58.838]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:27:59.118 --> 02:28:05.245]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.505 --> 02:28:07.227]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:28:07.247 --> 02:28:07.507]  We're good.
[02:28:31.290 --> 02:28:34.251]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 that's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:44.689]  Terrorism!
[02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:45.609]  Terrorism!
[02:28:45.709 --> 02:28:51.774]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:28:52.035 --> 02:28:53.616]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:28:53.876 --> 02:28:56.338]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:28:56.738 --> 02:29:11.310]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:29:11.350 --> 02:29:11.670]  government.
[02:29:11.851 --> 02:29:13.632]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:29:14.012 --> 02:29:19.917]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:29:20.057 --> 02:29:24.561]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:30:17.853 --> 02:30:18.133]  I'm good.
[02:31:06.869 --> 02:31:21.921]  Welcome back!
[02:31:21.961 --> 02:31:23.622]  We're trying to defend the Republic.
[02:31:23.682 --> 02:31:24.363]  Resurrected.
[02:31:24.403 --> 02:31:25.104]  It's on the gurney.
[02:31:25.144 --> 02:31:29.667]  We're trying to use defibrillating shock paddles to get the heart going again.
[02:31:29.727 --> 02:31:31.689]  Only you can save the country with God's help.
[02:31:32.871 --> 02:31:33.532]  Welcome back.
[02:31:33.552 --> 02:31:38.556]  We're going to let Bev Harris go here in just a moment because she's in monsoon-type weather, driving down the highway.
[02:31:38.576 --> 02:31:43.460]  I don't want her to wreck and die here without the New World Order, you know, having to get her themselves.
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:45.241]  Yeah, we don't want to do the New World Order's work for it.
[02:31:45.722 --> 02:32:01.895]  So we're going to let her just finish up with about a five-minute comment, and then we're going to go back to Michael Rivero, let him have a final question for her, and then just continue taking calls from the loaded phone lines and recap some of the top stories as the clear pattern of election fraud orchestrated by the White House, and some Democrats control their own areas and are doing it too.
[02:32:02.495 --> 02:32:03.676]  The retaliation is increasing.
[02:32:03.696 --> 02:32:09.642]  We just mentioned about the Ohio professor that they were trying to arrest for checking the results.
[02:32:09.662 --> 02:32:15.888]  We now have an elections official in Utah that was fired because he had the machines checked.
[02:32:28.713 --> 02:32:37.498]  Stephen Heller, the gentleman in Los Angeles who is so courageous, allegedly leaking documents that were very devastating to people.
[02:32:37.538 --> 02:32:47.284]  He is now facing up to five years in jail, despite the fact that Daniel Ellsberg himself says that the leak of those documents was as important as the Pentagon Papers.
[02:32:48.045 --> 02:32:53.828]  We actually had a guy in Colorado who was arrested for throwing a tea bag at a voting machine.
[02:32:56.502 --> 02:32:58.123]  I think there's going to be more of the same.
[02:32:58.143 --> 02:33:04.624]  One of our directors, Board of Directors, was arrested for trying to watch the vote count in San Diego.
[02:33:06.005 --> 02:33:15.988]  You know, it's not... I don't want to intimidate people, because you need to get involved, but there's probably going to be a phase where it gets very uncomfortable.
[02:33:18.149 --> 02:33:28.014]  Well yeah, we're going up against a criminal system that's trying to steal our right to vote and give us all the tyranny that comes along with a society where the people have no control.
[02:33:28.074 --> 02:33:29.755]  And your phone was cutting out on that first one.
[02:33:29.815 --> 02:33:34.437]  Recap the person being criminally charged for simply trying to get exit polls.
[02:33:34.477 --> 02:33:35.238]  Tell us their name.
[02:33:35.518 --> 02:33:36.278]  Give us the details.
[02:33:36.298 --> 02:33:37.379]  We're going to write this up, Bev.
[02:33:37.399 --> 02:33:39.620]  Her name's Victoria Lovegren.
[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:42.461]  She runs OhioVigilance.org.
[02:33:43.182 --> 02:33:44.722]  And it wasn't exit polls.
[02:33:44.802 --> 02:33:47.824]  She was simply trying to find out the results on the poll tape.
[02:33:48.718 --> 02:33:52.219]  I mean, that's really what exit polls have always... I mean, that's a type of exit poll.
[02:33:52.239 --> 02:33:56.320]  By that I mean the precincts have always released how the votes are going.
[02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:57.261]  This is standard.
[02:33:58.001 --> 02:33:58.241]  Yeah.
[02:33:58.721 --> 02:34:13.866]  Now, with all this retaliation going on, what we have going for us is that we're still pretending we're this lovely democracy, as we call it, and we're telling the rest of the world we've got this lovely election system.
[02:34:14.246 --> 02:34:17.587]  And as long as they have that image going, we have leverage.
[02:34:20.043 --> 02:34:22.224]  Well, again, there has been a major wake-up call.
[02:34:22.404 --> 02:34:25.166]  Is there any other intimidation we should know about?
[02:34:25.206 --> 02:34:26.826]  I know you've been intimidated quite a bit.
[02:34:26.866 --> 02:34:31.349]  Diebold tried to threaten HBO to not show the big film you're hacking, Democracy.
[02:34:31.889 --> 02:34:33.830]  You've had some intimidation in the past as well.
[02:34:34.890 --> 02:34:38.152]  Yeah, I have had as well, that's true.
[02:34:38.492 --> 02:34:47.676]  I don't talk about it a lot, but perhaps the scariest thing was they were... Well, actually, I got a death threat this past week when the HBO thing came on.
[02:34:47.817 --> 02:34:48.657]  What did they say to you?
[02:34:50.382 --> 02:34:53.706]  I hope you die a horrible, awful, slow and painful death.
[02:34:53.986 --> 02:34:54.867]  We're going to get you.
[02:34:54.927 --> 02:34:55.608]  That kind of stuff.
[02:34:55.648 --> 02:34:57.190]  But it's always anonymous.
[02:34:57.570 --> 02:34:58.071]  Cowardly.
[02:34:59.261 --> 02:35:00.002]  No, I understand.
[02:35:00.022 --> 02:35:01.263]  I've enjoyed that as well.
[02:35:01.323 --> 02:35:06.668]  In fact, a lot of times I'll be tired, don't want to work 18 hours a day and I get a death threat and I go, that's it!
[02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:12.474]  Or I see their propaganda and it just actually empowers me and all the COINTELPRO hit pieces.
[02:35:12.754 --> 02:35:15.356]  They also have people acting like they're in our movement.
[02:35:15.376 --> 02:35:18.740]  I've noticed they've been attacking you, myself, Mike Rivero and others.
[02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:21.742]  They have a lot of COINTELPRO operatives posing as good people.
[02:35:22.303 --> 02:35:23.124]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:35:23.144 --> 02:35:24.245]  There's actually a guy
[02:35:24.724 --> 02:35:26.305]  You know, there's another John Dean.
[02:35:26.365 --> 02:35:28.207]  There's John Dean of Watergate fame.
[02:35:28.227 --> 02:35:31.009]  But there's a John Dean, a different guy, named the same thing.
[02:35:31.489 --> 02:35:37.494]  And he has made it his business to track down these phonies who are infiltrating the movement.
[02:35:37.654 --> 02:35:39.456]  And he's actually made some headway.
[02:35:39.576 --> 02:35:50.725]  He was able to help us identify one guy, a guy by the name of Rob Pelche, who is actually working for Diebold, but he's running around the internet under a whole bunch of assumed names
[02:35:51.423 --> 02:35:55.844]  Opposing libel against all kinds of voting activists.
[02:35:56.585 --> 02:35:58.705]  You know, it's easy.
[02:35:58.745 --> 02:36:04.167]  They just put on fake names, give themselves five or six of them, and say whatever they want.
[02:36:04.827 --> 02:36:06.248]  Well, I mean, it's like Jeff Gannon.
[02:36:06.268 --> 02:36:09.509]  They even put these fakes up with fake names in press conferences.
[02:36:09.849 --> 02:36:14.850]  And again, a lot of them pose as activists that are on our side, but it's not working anymore.
[02:36:16.151 --> 02:36:16.391]  Right.
[02:36:16.511 --> 02:36:19.752]  This is what's so great about the fact that lots of different groups
[02:36:20.385 --> 02:36:20.846]  I think so.
[02:36:38.129 --> 02:36:39.571]  Yeah, that was actually Diebold.
[02:36:40.612 --> 02:36:41.954]  It was a guy that worked for Diebold.
[02:36:41.974 --> 02:36:43.375]  We finally followed him to work.
[02:36:43.455 --> 02:36:47.460]  He was so stupid, he called himself the HTML Ninja, or the Diebold Ninja.
[02:36:47.821 --> 02:36:53.728]  And he actually caught himself on his wife's webcam, posting libel against Black Box Voting.
[02:36:54.188 --> 02:36:58.253]  We went to his house, because he put a picture of his house on his personal website.
[02:36:58.866 --> 02:37:01.947]  And following the people.
[02:37:02.367 --> 02:37:04.388]  You know, that's racketeering and harassment.
[02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:05.988]  Why don't you sue these bastards?
[02:37:06.028 --> 02:37:09.369]  Are you so busy fighting them on other levels, you just don't have the time?
[02:37:09.649 --> 02:37:16.031]  Yeah, there's X amount of time in the day, and a lawsuit, to do it right, you've got to spend a lot of time on it.
[02:37:16.391 --> 02:37:18.414]  Well, you know, that's something else other activists can do.
[02:37:18.454 --> 02:37:21.378]  When you get COINTELPRO to harass, you can sue them.
[02:37:21.418 --> 02:37:22.700]  That's a job for other people to do.
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:29.949]  I've had to sue a few people, and won each time, and somebody's even gone to prison over it here locally, and another person's about to go to prison over it.
[02:37:30.810 --> 02:37:34.015]  That's put in the paper, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, so we'll send you to prison.
[02:37:34.475 --> 02:37:41.721]  Don't worry, you're going to be going to prison, and it's going to take just a few more of their people going public about how they were hired for fraud.
[02:37:41.982 --> 02:37:45.104]  They're very close to going under, that's why they're getting so desperate.
[02:37:45.364 --> 02:37:48.067]  I want to let Michael Rivero ask you any final questions.
[02:37:48.087 --> 02:37:49.028]  We're going to let you go, Bev.
[02:37:49.628 --> 02:37:49.908]  Alright.
[02:37:50.909 --> 02:37:57.755]  Okay, not really a question, but a story that broke today, and it's on my website, is the parent company of Diebold,
[02:37:58.603 --> 02:37:59.164]  Or Diebold.
[02:37:59.284 --> 02:38:00.324]  I hear it both ways.
[02:38:01.005 --> 02:38:12.992]  But basically, the company that makes the safes in the ATM machines is seriously considering closing their voting machine division because there's been so much negative publicity that it's harming their overall corporate brand.
[02:38:13.173 --> 02:38:15.514]  But what they'll do is sell it to a subsidiary.
[02:38:15.694 --> 02:38:17.275]  We've got to expose that one, too.
[02:38:18.716 --> 02:38:21.518]  Yeah, or maybe we can buy ourselves and fix all the problems.
[02:38:23.119 --> 02:38:23.639]  Exactly.
[02:38:23.699 --> 02:38:24.440]  No, no.
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:25.520]  That is fabulous news.
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:26.401]  Bev, comment on that.
[02:38:27.409 --> 02:38:29.850]  Well, you know, that's fabulous news.
[02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:31.611]  We do need to vote them off the island.
[02:38:32.192 --> 02:38:39.176]  But, we've still got election systems and software out there, which has managed to escape pretty much unscathed.
[02:38:39.736 --> 02:38:45.219]  And they need our hard work, as do the other major manufacturers, Hardener, Civic, and Sequoia.
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:46.920]  Who is the worst?
[02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:49.662]  Who is the worst of the big four, big five companies?
[02:38:49.722 --> 02:38:50.963]  It's really hard to say.
[02:38:51.323 --> 02:38:54.285]  I have a nasty feeling that Siebold is the best of three.
[02:38:56.306 --> 02:39:00.169]  So really, they may just be the best known, but not the worst.
[02:39:00.209 --> 02:39:03.691]  So it's kind of a motley crew of piratical characters.
[02:39:04.091 --> 02:39:11.677]  But I will let you know here on your show, Alex, that I have now got a hold of the software of the other three major vendors and will be releasing it.
[02:39:12.557 --> 02:39:14.218]  Oh, is that an exclusive you're giving us?
[02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:16.481]  It is!
[02:39:16.601 --> 02:39:18.304]  I haven't said it on the radio yet.
[02:39:18.364 --> 02:39:19.365]  I've said it privately.
[02:39:19.805 --> 02:39:20.346]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:20.386 --> 02:39:22.429]  You've now gotten the software of the other big three.
[02:39:22.549 --> 02:39:23.710]  Do you want to say the names?
[02:39:23.771 --> 02:39:28.637]  Yeah, Lexus Systems and Software, Sequoia, and Heart InterCivic.
[02:39:30.023 --> 02:39:33.146]  You now have the code of the other Big Three.
[02:39:33.226 --> 02:39:34.868]  Okay, the Big Four are now exposed.
[02:39:35.108 --> 02:39:36.149]  Bev Harris, I salute you.
[02:39:36.169 --> 02:39:38.612]  I want to get you back on this week for just a little 10-minute report.
[02:39:39.172 --> 02:39:40.273]  Tomorrow, if we can.
[02:39:40.373 --> 02:39:41.735]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:39:42.255 --> 02:39:43.717]  Where are you going downtown right now?
[02:39:44.297 --> 02:39:46.780]  Oh, I'm going to be on CNN shortly here, I guess.
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:47.701]  Okay.
[02:39:48.041 --> 02:39:49.062]  Bev, we'll be watching.
[02:39:49.082 --> 02:39:49.643]  God bless you.
[02:39:50.143 --> 02:39:50.484]  Thank you.
[02:39:50.564 --> 02:39:50.824]  Bye-bye.
[02:39:51.765 --> 02:39:52.166]  Thank you.
[02:39:52.406 --> 02:39:55.588]  Folks, you're getting the best coverage here with Michael Rivero, Bev Harris, all the callers.
[02:39:55.608 --> 02:39:56.669]  We're about to go back to the calls.
[02:39:57.990 --> 02:40:14.022]  Yeah, I mean, I think her point is so central that you need to do the things on their checklist to go down and just ask questions politely and be treated like a criminal to discover how criminal this system is and think about the intimidation and diabol with their spooks out there attacking people that stand up against them.
[02:40:14.362 --> 02:40:17.505]  I mean, this is mafia tactics, Michael Rivero.
[02:40:18.667 --> 02:40:24.332]  Yeah, but always remember, you know, because we went through the same thing back when we were trying to get the Vietnam War shut down.
[02:40:25.193 --> 02:40:31.518]  The first few people who stood up, yes, they got arrested, they got thrown in jail, but soon there were so many people standing up, they can't arrest them all.
[02:40:31.819 --> 02:40:44.730]  They don't have enough people, they don't have enough jail cells, and the bottom line is, and I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but as long as we tolerate liars and cheaters in government, we will always have a government that lies and cheats.
[02:40:45.177 --> 02:40:56.100]  And the only way we're going to stop it is when we the people will walk into our government buildings, grab the people we've caught lying and cheating, and kick them out onto the street hard enough to bounce twice.
[02:40:56.750 --> 02:41:00.273]  And make the cost of cheating and lies outweigh the benefit.
[02:41:00.513 --> 02:41:03.455]  When we do that, the lying and cheating will go away.
[02:41:03.555 --> 02:41:04.876]  Well, you're right.
[02:41:05.216 --> 02:41:08.099]  And some people think that if you just ignore corruption, oh, it's normal.
[02:41:08.459 --> 02:41:08.799]  No, no, no.
[02:41:08.839 --> 02:41:09.900]  Corruption grows.
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:14.223]  And you end up with $4 trillion almost missing from the Pentagon in the last eight years.
[02:41:14.924 --> 02:41:16.905]  You end up with FEMA camps.
[02:41:16.925 --> 02:41:19.928]  You end up with bid rigging and no-bid contracts and corruption.
[02:41:20.308 --> 02:41:22.430]  I mean, folks, it isn't just election fraud.
[02:41:22.450 --> 02:41:24.231]  It's all the tyranny that comes with it, Mike.
[02:41:25.322 --> 02:41:26.603]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:26.823 --> 02:41:45.057]  Unfortunately, when a government starts to go bad, it will eventually go all bad, because everybody's trying to get their cronies in, they don't want the whistleblowers around, laws get tougher and harder to find crooks in government, and we get to a situation like we have right now, where the people are afraid of the government, and it really should be the other way around.
[02:41:45.097 --> 02:41:46.718]  The government should be afraid of the people.
[02:41:46.999 --> 02:41:48.400]  That's what keeps the people free.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:54.104]  But the first and foremost thing is, we've got to get honest elections back, because without honest elections,
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:56.901]  Nothing else we do will really make a difference.
[02:41:56.941 --> 02:42:06.445]  All the protesting, all the peace marches, all the ribbons tied to our car antennas, none of it will work if we don't have a system of honest, verifiable elections in this country.
[02:42:06.865 --> 02:42:24.112]  And I want to end with a comment that I put on my website all the time, which is that if a government cannot prove the accuracy and honesty of the elections by which it claims authority over the people, then the people are neither legally nor morally obligated to obey that government or to pay its bills.
[02:42:24.736 --> 02:42:25.336]  Say that again.
[02:42:25.356 --> 02:42:26.676]  Okay.
[02:42:27.296 --> 02:42:40.379]  If a government cannot prove the accuracy and honesty of the election by which it claims authority over the people, then the people are neither legally nor morally obligated to obey that government or to pay its bills.
[02:42:40.639 --> 02:42:48.840]  And for 20 years, as we exposed the election fraud, myself for 12, you for more than 12, Bev for 5, they called us kooks and conspiracy terrorists.
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:50.301]  Now everything we've shed has been proven.
[02:42:50.321 --> 02:42:51.961]  Now we've won the hearts and minds of the people.
[02:42:52.731 --> 02:42:55.335]  Now, will we be able to wrest control away from these criminals?
[02:42:55.375 --> 02:42:59.180]  But I am seeing some of the arrogance drain out of their faces.
[02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:02.224]  I'm seeing fear now by the people in government.
[02:43:02.264 --> 02:43:05.989]  I mean, look at the neocons jumping ship and now stabbing Bush in the back.
[02:43:07.452 --> 02:43:13.718]  Well, fear is good on one hand and on the other it's bad because a cornered animal is the most dangerous animal.
[02:43:14.179 --> 02:43:17.502]  Like I said, my highest hope is that the U.S.
[02:43:17.542 --> 02:43:21.266]  government is simply going to fall apart the way the USSR did.
[02:43:21.326 --> 02:43:25.590]  That's the best possible option, you know, with the least amount of upset and bloodshed.
[02:43:26.011 --> 02:43:28.293]  I think there's a very good possibility it's going to happen.
[02:43:29.127 --> 02:43:35.015]  If it doesn't, it's inevitable there's going to be a collision between the government and the people, and it's going to be a violent one.
[02:43:35.055 --> 02:43:39.020]  And by the way, the mainstream media keeps it very quiet, but it's in major regional papers.
[02:43:39.982 --> 02:43:42.886]  Three states right now are seriously looking at secession.
[02:43:43.755 --> 02:43:45.837]  And look, the Feds seceded from the U.S.
[02:43:46.378 --> 02:43:54.166]  I want to have the states secede, then in a new federation, reconstitute the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, culture.
[02:43:54.587 --> 02:43:59.992]  And I think that things are getting so bad, Mike, that we need to move towards breaking up the country to reconstitute it.
[02:44:01.213 --> 02:44:02.895]  Yeah, that may definitely happen.
[02:44:02.915 --> 02:44:06.339]  We may see it actually balkanize into three or four smaller
[02:44:06.955 --> 02:44:14.380]  Uh... countries uh... but the bottom line is that the path that we're on right now cannot last forever that we're heading toward a crisis of some sort.
[02:44:25.337 --> 02:44:28.740]  And he talked about how the globalists are seizing the roads.
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:30.401]  This is part of the New World Order.
[02:44:30.441 --> 02:44:31.182]  It is defunded.
[02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:33.924]  The trans-NAFTA highways.
[02:44:34.264 --> 02:44:35.965]  We are going into receivership.
[02:44:36.025 --> 02:44:36.966]  We are bankrupt.
[02:44:37.246 --> 02:44:38.627]  They have doubled the money supply.
[02:44:38.647 --> 02:44:39.828]  They're about to double it again.
[02:44:41.269 --> 02:44:42.330]  A bunch of foreign governments.
[02:44:42.350 --> 02:44:46.854]  The Canadian press today is real mad, saying they're giving them fake job numbers, fake stock market numbers.
[02:44:47.154 --> 02:44:50.597]  I mean, even the world is now recognizing that it's all fake!
[02:44:51.077 --> 02:44:52.078]  How long can this
[02:44:52.914 --> 02:44:56.035]  I mean, the real estate market bubble is starting to implode.
[02:44:56.515 --> 02:45:02.556]  How long can this illusion, this vapor, this projection by these projectors continue?
[02:45:03.797 --> 02:45:07.778]  Well, they're continuing it mostly by deception.
[02:45:08.118 --> 02:45:17.380]  There was an article that came out this morning where long-term financial strategists are saying that the official government figures on unemployment
[02:45:17.791 --> 02:45:23.176]  Are being revised so much and and and and so often that they're no longer trustworthy.
[02:45:23.356 --> 02:45:23.876]  Exactly.
[02:45:23.916 --> 02:45:25.017]  They're not trustworthy.
[02:45:25.678 --> 02:45:26.338]  It's nonsense.
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:35.546]  And that basically means that the numbers that we're all looking at to base our decision on how well things are going, they cannot be relied upon anymore.
[02:45:35.966 --> 02:45:44.994]  Certainly we know that one of the most important numbers for economic understanding, the M3 cash aggregate, they stopped publishing it entirely a few months back.
[02:45:45.362 --> 02:45:52.745]  Which means that the average American investor, business owner, homeowner, doesn't know how much total cash is in circulation.
[02:45:53.066 --> 02:45:56.427]  And that is a direct measure of how much inflation is really going on.
[02:45:56.507 --> 02:46:02.670]  And the last announcement we had was, is a doubling in the last six years, and a doubling in the next two, and then Bernanke made it secret.
[02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:03.030]  Go ahead.
[02:46:04.191 --> 02:46:13.475]  Yeah, basically what it is, is it's very common for an incumbent government to flood the economy with lots of easy cash, going into an election to try and make things look good.
[02:46:13.965 --> 02:46:20.228]  And it was possible to do this because we had this exploding real estate market that was acting as a cash sink.
[02:46:20.649 --> 02:46:34.076]  So the cash would flow out from the Federal Reserve, would circulate through the economy, was being dumped into these new real estate purchases that people were doing, and so we didn't see the signs of inflation because we didn't have too much cash chasing too few goods and services.
[02:46:34.176 --> 02:46:41.200]  And now, despite that cash inflation, we have a 17.4% in the last period drop in overall prices of real estate.
[02:46:42.313 --> 02:46:50.477]  Yeah, and when that cash sink is no longer available, all that excess cash is going to really catch up with us, and we're going to see a real major leap.
[02:46:50.497 --> 02:47:00.101]  Now you notice, exactly, you notice three weeks ago when they announced that the real estate had dropped, you notice that suddenly the stock market jumped, because that's the last cash sink left.
[02:47:00.441 --> 02:47:09.565]  You actually have a currency devalued by more than half, chasing the selected Dow 30, which is staged at another level, and so the stock market's really now below $6,000.
[02:47:11.666 --> 02:47:12.487]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:12.527 --> 02:47:14.407]  The stock market has become the new cash sink.
[02:47:14.427 --> 02:47:27.413]  They're running up as high as they can, not only to absorb the surplus cash, but also because it's been a favored political banner of the economy going back to the Clinton years.
[02:47:27.593 --> 02:47:31.574]  Let's go to a quick one-minute report from Vicki Karp here in Austin with Vote Rescue.
[02:47:31.834 --> 02:47:34.235]  Vicki, what's the new intel you've got on the problems?
[02:47:34.255 --> 02:47:37.297]  I don't have too much more in Austin right now.
[02:47:37.337 --> 02:47:40.138]  I do have a few more bits for you regarding around the country.
[02:47:41.442 --> 02:47:48.848]  In terms of numbers of complaints filed so far within certain states, I've got in Pennsylvania, 841.
[02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:50.810]  New York, 399.
[02:47:50.910 --> 02:47:51.510]  Michigan, 313.
[02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:53.752]  North Carolina, 239.
[02:47:53.992 --> 02:47:55.674]  And on and on it goes.
[02:47:56.734 --> 02:47:59.937]  Two hour delays in Utah using electronic machines.
[02:48:00.495 --> 02:48:11.065]  We've got votes flipping in Missouri, and then we have a right-wing talk show host, Laura Ingram, telling her callers to jam the Democratic voter complaint line with crank calls.
[02:48:12.085 --> 02:48:23.336]  So we have open, now we know they have fake calls, harassing calls, acting like Democrats, by computers being made, total racketeering, totally illegal, now Ingram is engaging in illegal activity on the radio?
[02:48:23.356 --> 02:48:24.717]  It sounds like it.
[02:48:25.974 --> 02:48:27.655]  Okay, Vicki Karp, stay there.
[02:48:27.675 --> 02:48:31.077]  I want to briefly get a little more recap on what's happening in Austin.
[02:48:31.477 --> 02:48:33.058]  Michael Rivero going with us to the end.
[02:48:33.299 --> 02:48:35.860]  Help us push TerrorStorm to number one on the Amazon charts.
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:37.861]  Buy it right now at Amazon.com.
[02:48:37.961 --> 02:48:39.682]  Get TerrorStorm right now.
[02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:40.423]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.384 --> 02:48:50.545]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.905 --> 02:48:52.805]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:53.205 --> 02:49:00.867]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.527 --> 02:49:08.588]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.989 --> 02:49:15.870]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:16.388 --> 02:49:20.429]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.729 --> 02:49:24.209]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:26.630]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:30.871]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.284 --> 02:49:49.509]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:49.649 --> 02:49:57.736]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:57.996 --> 02:50:05.062]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:05.222 --> 02:50:06.502]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:06.582 --> 02:50:12.483]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:12.663 --> 02:50:17.764]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:17.864 --> 02:50:26.746]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[02:51:48.356 --> 02:51:50.456]  I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:51:50.696 --> 02:51:54.637]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:51:55.537 --> 02:52:02.199]  Even your emotions haven't let go in so much space.
[02:52:03.059 --> 02:52:09.120]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah I was out of touch.
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:11.001]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:52:14.754 --> 02:52:18.098]  Thank you for joining us today.

[02:52:28.627 --> 02:52:30.488]  Please help us drive TerrorStorm to number one.
[02:52:30.528 --> 02:52:32.209]  It's getting close to leaving the top 100.
[02:52:32.250 --> 02:52:33.630]  They've been playing all sorts of tricks.
[02:52:34.171 --> 02:52:35.652]  Get in there, buy a couple copies.
[02:52:36.072 --> 02:52:36.192]  It's $11.
[02:52:37.833 --> 02:52:39.735]  You can't beat it.
[02:52:40.055 --> 02:52:39.735]  $11.19.
[02:52:40.675 --> 02:52:42.476]  It's my new film, Government Sponsored Terror.
[02:52:42.516 --> 02:52:43.337]  Totally documented.
[02:52:43.377 --> 02:52:44.638]  Available at Amazon.com.
[02:52:44.678 --> 02:52:46.019]  Links on InfoWars.com.

[02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:49.341]  We have it in stock.
[02:52:49.621 --> 02:52:51.062]  And get TerrorStorm for $9.95 with it if you choose.
[02:52:52.811 --> 02:52:59.236]  Also available at Infowars.com by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:52:59.336 --> 02:53:03.659]  Real quick, Vicki Karp, recapping what happened, what's happening, the reports you're getting here in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:03.679 --> 02:53:04.820]  I'm going to take three final calls.
[02:53:06.281 --> 02:53:22.252]  Yes, we had a report of some machines that, it turned out that they were machines that never would start up in a Westlake district this morning, and apparently they just set the machines aside, and to the credit of our county, they did not allow Hart to come in and fix them, as far as I know.
[02:53:22.796 --> 02:53:24.999]  That's against their policy.
[02:53:26.321 --> 02:53:37.576]  In Williamson County they were handing out the wrong ballots, or the wrong ballots were appearing on the screen at Cedar Park High School, and we had a total power outage at the Pan American Rec Center.
[02:53:38.098 --> 02:53:41.360]  On East 3rd Street, where we have one of our parallel election tables.
[02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:43.121]  I still haven't received that update.
[02:53:43.201 --> 02:53:48.043]  Well, the few places you've got your parallel exit polling system, they're just not going to allow anything to happen there.
[02:53:48.283 --> 02:53:50.584]  We'll talk to you tomorrow and on other shows here on Genesis.
[02:53:50.844 --> 02:53:51.785]  Thank you, Vicki Carb.
[02:53:52.545 --> 02:53:55.006]  Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Kentucky.
[02:53:55.047 --> 02:53:55.967]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:00.429]  Yes, Alex.
[02:54:00.649 --> 02:54:01.110]  Yes, hurry.
[02:54:01.310 --> 02:54:05.892]  They told us on AM radio last week, two weeks ago, to expect
[02:54:06.543 --> 02:54:10.724]  glitches due to federal law for all machines to be touch screened.
[02:54:12.125 --> 02:54:15.946]  I'm saying we're in a tight race here in the 2nd Congressional District.
[02:54:16.366 --> 02:54:28.390]  I hope Bev checks both this district and the 3rd Congressional District where I believe we both have tight races and I believe there's going to be some stuff going on here.
[02:54:29.571 --> 02:54:30.971]  I'm saying stay out of it.
[02:54:31.591 --> 02:54:33.452]  Both parties have failed to protect us.
[02:54:34.908 --> 02:54:37.489]  In the 90s and with 9-11.
[02:54:38.029 --> 02:54:38.669]  Thank you, Patrick.
[02:54:38.689 --> 02:54:39.790]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:42.890]  You know, Michael Rivero, look at right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:43.891]  There's all these problems.
[02:54:43.931 --> 02:54:45.631]  I mean, it's not just around the country.
[02:54:45.831 --> 02:54:46.471]  It's everywhere.
[02:54:47.632 --> 02:54:50.212]  Yeah, and it's absolutely shameful.
[02:54:50.492 --> 02:54:51.913]  And again, we get back to this issue.
[02:54:52.233 --> 02:54:54.213]  We're a technologically advanced nation.
[02:54:54.554 --> 02:54:56.554]  And these machines are very, very expensive.
[02:54:56.854 --> 02:54:59.755]  And yet we can't make them as reliable.
[02:55:02.015 --> 02:55:10.277]  I'm getting letters right now from people who are saying that not only the touchscreens, but even the optical ballot scanner machines are shutting down.
[02:55:10.938 --> 02:55:17.640]  And that's the October surprise, it's just frying the vote everywhere, coast to coast, and they just tell you who the winner is through ES&S.
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:20.701]  Let's go, and through Voter News Service, Paul in Florida.
[02:55:20.741 --> 02:55:21.381]  Go ahead, quickly.
[02:55:22.649 --> 02:55:29.992]  Uh, hello, I just got, I voted this morning over in Polk County, Florida, and I was suspicious, so I was watching everything.
[02:55:30.012 --> 02:55:32.013]  It was one of those fill-in-the-dot things.
[02:55:32.913 --> 02:55:38.155]  I ran a straight party ticket, and I took a look at the machine that you feed it into.
[02:55:38.235 --> 02:55:42.657]  It's got a little display screen, and one of the things it displays is how many ballots it's counted.
[02:55:43.558 --> 02:55:46.419]  It was early in the morning, and mine said 84.
[02:55:46.959 --> 02:55:49.300]  So I stuck in my straight party ticket,
[02:55:50.632 --> 02:55:53.373]  And it stayed 84, but took the cheat.
[02:55:53.493 --> 02:55:56.634]  And I figure, well, maybe it was just the counter was broken.
[02:55:56.734 --> 02:55:59.915]  So I stepped aside and let other people feed in their cheats.
[02:56:00.815 --> 02:56:02.956]  And with every one of them, the counter advanced.
[02:56:03.076 --> 02:56:06.397]  I told the lady at the desk, and she says, oh, you must have been wrong.
[02:56:06.437 --> 02:56:07.757]  You've seen the number wrong.
[02:56:08.157 --> 02:56:09.578]  Oh, yes, you saw the number wrong.
[02:56:09.598 --> 02:56:10.238]  We're out of time.
[02:56:10.278 --> 02:56:11.518]  I apologize to Bill in Iowa.
[02:56:11.538 --> 02:56:12.278]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:12.298 --> 02:56:14.659]  I want everybody to call me with your election stories tomorrow.
[02:56:14.959 --> 02:56:17.660]  Michael Rivero, I salute your work at WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:18.020]  Thank you.
[02:56:18.954 --> 02:56:19.255]  Thank you.
[02:56:19.295 --> 02:56:19.915]  Talk to you next month.
[02:56:20.116 --> 02:56:20.456]  You bet.
[02:56:20.596 --> 02:56:22.338]  Go get Terror Storm right now, folks.
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:28.586]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
