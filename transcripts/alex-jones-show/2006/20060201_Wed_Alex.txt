[00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:06.546]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.247]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.088]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:11.549]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.250]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.672]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:22.175]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:33.222]  Well, I'm gonna try to control myself today in this Indy 500 Info War and not, uh, not blow an engine or spin out and crash.
[00:00:34.694 --> 00:00:40.096]  Because it's days like these that I'm chomping at the bit, literally.
[00:00:41.096 --> 00:00:45.417]  In fact, I had three guests scheduled today, but I canceled two of them.
[00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:53.019]  We still have an important guest coming on in the third hour to talk about some very important issues.
[00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.501]  I'll tell you about that later, but I canceled a couple of other guests because I gotta have some time.
[00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:07.488]  To get into the unbelievable lies of the State of the Union speech last night.
[00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:17.435]  I watched half of it from my home, got in the car to drive over to the studio because I was going to be doing some late night work and listen to it in the car.
[00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:29.964]  And then I went back and read the transcript last night and I just, I could spend three hours on how everything Bush said was a fabricated lie and
[00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:35.225]  Just so incredibly crafted to be deceptive.
[00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:45.093]  I mean, I could talk for an hour about one paragraph that I'm looking at, and it actually makes the temples throb.
[00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:50.897]  My heart rate actually accelerates because I get angry.
[00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.198]  I know the average American.
[00:01:53.067 --> 00:02:04.545]  Unfortunately, is an expert on football and how to act cool, but knows absolutely nothing about how our government works, about our history, and they will just suck it up!
[00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.589]  I am so tired of it!
[00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:09.424]  I mean, I thought Bill Clinton was a liar.
[00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:11.406]  I just... Bush!
[00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:17.570]  The speechwriters, Karl Rove obviously had the talking points on this and some speechwriter packaged it.
[00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:29.339]  This stuff makes Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, it makes his work look like middle school literature compared to Shakespeare.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.683]  It's just one giant, bent fraud.
[00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:43.497]  So, we'll get past the hyperbole and get into just some of the lies, and believe me, I can't spend all day on this, because all the news today is earth-shattering and massive.
[00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:58.020]  I mentioned an AP article yesterday about how Halliburton's getting to start off $380-something million to build FEMA camps, and they say it's for illegal aliens, but then they say for natural disasters or, you know, civil emergencies.
[00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:02.184]  And Halliburton runs the camps, many of them in Iraq.
[00:03:02.744 --> 00:03:05.705]  Halliburton is just unbelievably evil.
[00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:11.066]  And these are the concentration camps being built right in front of our eyes.
[00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:12.507]  And again, they're going to be private.
[00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:15.207]  And everything is going to be private.
[00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:19.809]  It's all about public-private partnerships, not privatization.
[00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.709]  It is where
[00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:42.835]  Corporations that are bigger than most governments pay off your government, and then the government signs government power to them, and then they, well, it's like old sharecroppers who are, in many cases, actual slaves, or where you're a coal miner and you owe your soul to the company's store, you never get out of debt, and, you know, the coal mine manager rapes your wife at his leisure.
[00:03:43.495 --> 00:03:49.177]  I mean, that's the type of world we're living, and it's openly owned by the Dutch and British royal families,
[00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:54.335]  I heard Joan V. on, on Derry Brownfield's show here on the Genesis Network earlier today.
[00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:55.275]  I'm gonna try to get her on.
[00:03:55.295 --> 00:03:56.156]  She's coming back from Davos.
[00:03:56.476 --> 00:04:06.380]  And she was saying everything we already know, but I mean, she was there seeing it again, where it's all how Prince Charles designed it all, and it just, they come in, they buy the government, the government hands everything over to them!
[00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.541]  I mean, it's real simple!
[00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:18.986]  And they train the police to be attack dogs that hate the people, they simultaneously brainwash the public to love being slaves, and it's just, it's just unbelievably bad.
[00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:27.833]  And, uh, it... Again, I'm already starting to jabber and jibber because I... My head spins.
[00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:33.176]  My head spins when I just... You ought to see the news I've got here in front of me.
[00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:34.657]  We're going to try to go through all of it.
[00:04:37.438 --> 00:04:46.423]  The Daily Show host did one of the most astute, piercing, important reports I've ever seen on mainstream television.
[00:04:46.443 --> 00:04:48.164]  In fact, probably the most piercing.
[00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.027]  Just amazing.
[00:04:51.047 --> 00:04:53.250]  We're going to play a clip of that.
[00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:56.353]  There's so much coming up today.
[00:04:56.814 --> 00:04:58.115]  Ultramassive broadcast.

[00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:27.224]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.484 --> 00:05:32.065]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:38.447]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:40.368]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:10.018]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:07:10.238 --> 00:07:12.059]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.479]  That's one in four adults.
[00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.760]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it,
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.884]  The American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.444]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:15.128]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:22.413]  We're going to spend a little bit of time today dissecting just a few of the
[00:08:23.587 --> 00:08:33.997]  Manifest frauds that the puppet-in-chief, the petty nobody, was spewing last night worldwide on television, the radio and the internet.
[00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:41.124]  I mean, seriously, I could spend the entire broadcast on this and I'm not going to do it.
[00:08:41.164 --> 00:08:42.545]  We are going to open the phones up.
[00:08:43.303 --> 00:08:54.607]  I'd like to hear from first-time callers or folks that don't call on a routine basis today to give others a chance to get involved on air and to get your take on the State of the Union or on any other news item you wish.
[00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:56.407]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:59.288]  But we will get into some of the audio clips of the speech.
[00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:05.830]  I've got about ten of them, but I think I'm just going to air a couple in the interest of time.
[00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:14.102]  And then I want to get into really serious news.
[00:09:14.122 --> 00:09:15.904]  Halliburton building concentration camps.
[00:09:16.384 --> 00:09:17.785]  It's just hidden in plain view.
[00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:19.967]  Houston Chronicle, Associated Press.
[00:09:20.047 --> 00:09:25.891]  Oh, there are emergency centers for illegal aliens and political dissidents during crises.
[00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:27.812]  And it's going to be a private FEMA camp.
[00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:29.193]  It's so good.
[00:09:29.233 --> 00:09:40.542]  And so Paul Watson has written a great article for PrisonPlanet.com listing all the mainstream news articles about one million man FEMA camps and Halliburton camps and all the things they're setting up and doing.
[00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:45.537]  And it sounds like a petty issue, but it's really important.
[00:09:46.317 --> 00:09:58.702]  Oprah Winfrey's made a big deal, really she's been hyping it, about how she was lied to concerning some pathetic book, what, A Million Little Pieces, that is another manifest scam or fraud.
[00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:05.964]  And the media is all shocked that someone would lie and that we've all been betrayed.
[00:10:06.504 --> 00:10:10.946]  And they're really muckraking, they're really doing some investigative journalism for you.
[00:10:11.886 --> 00:10:23.575]  And Jon Stewart did something piercing a few days ago with The Daily Show that has more serious news than what you'd call serious news.
[00:10:25.077 --> 00:10:30.641]  And he pointed out that, look at how the media ignores all the amazing lies of government.
[00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:32.843]  Democrats, Republicans, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:32.863 --> 00:10:40.349]  Look at how that's just accepted now, but then they'll all freak out and just go crazy over some author lying.
[00:10:41.972 --> 00:10:48.555]  And the reason I'm so excited about this piece that Jon Stewart did is that is exactly the page I'm on.
[00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:50.336]  This is how they control us.
[00:10:51.077 --> 00:10:57.720]  They'll spend months on some sports figure who's been using cocaine, or they'll spend years on O.J.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:05.844]  Simpson, or they'll spend months on Michael Jackson, or really years, or they'll endlessly talk about one woman kidnapped in Aruba.
[00:11:05.884 --> 00:11:06.364]  God bless her.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:17.048]  But then they'll totally ignore Alma Burton, who's going to run your concentration camps now, it's Associated Press, kidnapping children and women and using them in slave camps and sex slave camps.
[00:11:17.068 --> 00:11:27.497]  I mean, it can even be in major publications, but it's back of the paper and just kind of, yeah, they kidnap and they got lobbyists in Washington for the kidnapping rings and actual lobbyists were kidnappers.
[00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:30.908]  And so, again, they set the agenda.
[00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:40.856]  And that's because the New World Order knows that you want an investigation, you want some gumshoeing, some sleuthing, you know, murder, whodunit.
[00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:47.762]  They know that people are into real muckraking and investigations, so they give you some petty issue that doesn't matter.
[00:11:48.483 --> 00:11:50.905]  So the media can finally tell the truth.
[00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:54.868]  I mean, they'll tell the truth on how to bake a cake, or how to roast a turkey, or
[00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:57.698]  You know, get O.J.
[00:11:57.778 --> 00:11:59.839]  Killer with a knife, or was he innocent?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.462]  I mean, they'll really get into debt there.
[00:12:02.802 --> 00:12:03.703]  That's why they like it.
[00:12:03.963 --> 00:12:07.967]  Because if it's some petty issue, they don't have to lie and twist and spin all day.
[00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:09.388]  They can just actually go out and report.
[00:12:11.053 --> 00:12:14.734]  And so that is so much of what happens in society today.
[00:12:14.774 --> 00:12:24.917]  So coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play that clip from The Daily Show, where Jon Stewart just does an incredible job pointing this out.
[00:12:25.097 --> 00:12:25.677]  Finally!
[00:12:25.957 --> 00:12:27.017]  Paradigm shift!
[00:12:27.077 --> 00:12:30.218]  Because when I see something like that, I automatically tune out.
[00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:33.679]  When they tell me to focus on Aruba, I tune out.
[00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:37.500]  When they tell me to focus on how Bush is the great leader, I tune out.
[00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:38.841]  Because it's not true.
[00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:39.601]  He's a total puppet.
[00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.213]  They don't set my agenda.
[00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:44.695]  I set my own agenda.
[00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:53.944]  Now obviously they're trying to set the agenda right now that the State of the Union is so important and Bush is our leader and he's actually running something.
[00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:55.406]  The buck stops with him.
[00:12:56.312 --> 00:13:04.436]  And the elite does that so that he'll take all the blame or the praise for the New World Order operation, and then the whole system just moves on.
[00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:06.397]  And handbooks were written about this.
[00:13:06.457 --> 00:13:07.737]  Cecil Rhodes wrote them.
[00:13:08.117 --> 00:13:09.518]  A big server of the British Empire.
[00:13:09.718 --> 00:13:10.838]  Had a whole country named after him.
[00:13:10.878 --> 00:13:11.419]  Rhodesia.
[00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:13.300]  Started the world.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.100]  Died of a monopoly.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.241]  Major professors, political scientists, have written about it.
[00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:23.244]  Empires about 150 years ago started running into real opposition.
[00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:40.883]  And they found that if they would just remove, say, the local British governor who was a white guy, and if they would put one of the locals in, whether he was Arab, or Persian, or whether he was Malaysian, it didn't matter.
[00:13:41.583 --> 00:13:49.145]  If they would just put their puppet in, the people, on average, they would have formulas, would take about four times the abuse.
[00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:50.406]  Okay?
[00:13:51.670 --> 00:14:02.479]  And then they'd even have newspapers that they owned, and other handbills handed out, where the British government would attack their own minion, but on petty issues.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:12.847]  And then, my gosh, if the evil Brits, who still, of course, owned everything in the countries, and controlled everything, why, if they're attacking him, he must be good.
[00:14:13.308 --> 00:14:19.493]  And then everyone would rally around the thug, or it could even be a group of thugs, oligarchs, a collection of them.
[00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:21.814]  And really, the British didn't invent this.
[00:14:21.854 --> 00:14:22.915]  I mean, I talk a lot about it.
[00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:25.676]  It's a book that isn't even hard reading.
[00:14:25.876 --> 00:14:30.019]  It's The Battle for Gold, a collection of letters to the Senate by Julius Caesar.
[00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:51.687]  And in there, he talks about how he manipulates Gribbs, how he plays Germans off against Germans, or Visigoths and Austrogoths, and how he manipulates the Gauls, the French today, and how he would put in puppet leaders over them, and then even act like he didn't like the puppet leader to make the locals then think the puppet leader was good.
[00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:54.169]  I mean, this is all 101 Empire stuff.
[00:14:54.947 --> 00:14:55.227]  Okay?
[00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:59.470]  And they were so arrogant, they wrote books about it, laughing at their slaves.
[00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.133]  And they would even publish it in Rome, knowing that most people couldn't read even there.
[00:15:07.214 --> 00:15:13.218]  Or the Romans themselves would just snicker about the Empire manipulating those dumb hillbillies, those dumb barbarians.
[00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:17.921]  But at the same time, they were just as enslaved or more in Rome itself, in the city of Rome or in Italy.
[00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:21.023]  So, this is what makes me so angry.
[00:15:21.183 --> 00:15:21.603]  It's just...
[00:15:23.104 --> 00:15:24.325]  It's like Shake and Bake.
[00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:29.127]  You go and you buy pancake mix and you mix it up and you make pancakes.
[00:15:30.548 --> 00:15:35.931]  This is a Shake and Bake Lego set that even says it on the box.
[00:15:36.191 --> 00:15:40.974]  How to enslave, how to terrorize and bring tyranny in for total control.
[00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:45.977]  And they're following the exact directions on the Tyranny Shake and Bake box.
[00:15:46.537 --> 00:15:54.359]  And the general public is still so dumbed down, they don't even have any idea what's going on, and that's why I'm angry.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.320]  Of all these clips, here's one of the sickest.
[00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:11.504]  Now, again, we've had CIA officers on, we have had local sheriffs on, we've had local investigators on from Arkansas, DEA, you name it.
[00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:18.982]  Bill Clinton was chosen at the age of 17 to go into a deep-cover Central Intelligence Agency program.
[00:16:19.002 --> 00:16:24.025]  He then went to the Rhodes Scholar, Cecil Rhodes Institute for Imperial Rule.
[00:16:24.245 --> 00:16:27.267]  That's what it is, the state of the name, Global Imperial Rule.
[00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:36.632]  He was trained, and he became a protege of George Herbert Walker Bush, back when he was Central Intelligence Agency head in the early 1970s.
[00:16:39.776 --> 00:16:43.859]  And Bill Clinton has always been good friends with George Bush, Sr.
[00:16:43.979 --> 00:16:47.241]  They met 11 times in 1990 and 1991.
[00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:49.303]  They staged that whole election.
[00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:56.928]  I mean, I've interviewed the CIA officers, folks, and it was well known George Bush and Bill Clinton had a narcotics deal going right through me in Arkansas.
[00:16:57.068 --> 00:16:57.728]  This is public!
[00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.529]  Public!
[00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:00.435]  And people couldn't believe that.
[00:17:00.455 --> 00:17:05.378]  Well, now you can with Barbara calling Clinton her son, and Bush loves him.
[00:17:06.478 --> 00:17:11.140]  They get up on TV and praise each other at press conferences for 15 minutes, a piece first.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.460]  I timed it one time.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.101]  Bush Sr.
[00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:16.302]  worshipped Bill Clinton for 15 minutes, and then Clinton did it for about 5.
[00:17:16.442 --> 00:17:18.523]  I mean, just actual worship.
[00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:24.134]  They vacationed together, they've always vacationed together, and it was always minor footnotes.
[00:17:24.174 --> 00:17:30.198]  Well, last night in the speech, this is what George Bush had to say about the two people that his father loves most.
[00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:36.041]  Not Jeb, or Neil, or any of the other little crooks, or Marvin, who ran security in the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:44.086]  No, he loves Bill Clinton, and he loves his cokehead son, George W. Go ahead and roll it.
[00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:49.416]  We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending or entitlements.
[00:17:51.198 --> 00:17:59.584]  This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turned 60, including two of my dad's favorite people, me and President Clinton.
[00:18:05.068 --> 00:18:07.070]  This milestone is more than a personal crisis.
[00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.271]  Yeah, I mean, this is sick, folks.
[00:18:09.892 --> 00:18:10.792]  This is totally sick.
[00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:15.805]  And I told the Democrats, you should love George Bush.
[00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:20.367]  Gun control, open borders, more taxation and spending than you can ever imagine.
[00:18:20.607 --> 00:18:29.371]  Oh, he'll have some smoke and mirrors little tax cut over here, and then through different mandates from the states and other taxes, it's a massive increase at the end of the day.
[00:18:30.123 --> 00:18:34.165]  Around a 15% total national, on average, increase through the Feds.
[00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:37.227]  Stack that up against a 5 or 6% cut.
[00:18:37.287 --> 00:18:38.668]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:18:38.848 --> 00:18:46.573]  Then you have the dollar devalued by 40-plus percent, so then you compare that to a 5% cut, you begin to realize the type of fraud that we're hearing.
[00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:48.014]  And then these are the numbers.
[00:18:48.054 --> 00:18:49.294]  These aren't my opinion.
[00:18:49.655 --> 00:18:52.496]  I mean, this is the official, real hard numbers.
[00:18:52.556 --> 00:18:55.278]  Not the Koch numbers they gave you where, I don't remember, two years ago.
[00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:56.521]  Remember?
[00:18:56.961 --> 00:19:00.122]  Bush actually said that fast food is manufacturing.
[00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.283]  So it's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:19:03.323 --> 00:19:05.583]  And then he got into the really deceptive stuff.
[00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.685]  When we get back from break, I will get into some of these.
[00:19:09.885 --> 00:19:13.886]  But just very deceptive.
[00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:17.827]  He's also talking about how it's our job to take over the world to bring freedom.
[00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:22.168]  But that's diametrically opposed to what George Washington said.
[00:19:24.002 --> 00:19:27.264]  That's diametrically opposed to what the Constitution says.
[00:19:28.264 --> 00:19:32.686]  But according to Bush, that's the bedrock of Americana.
[00:19:34.847 --> 00:19:37.208]  He's gone from the most loved country in the world to most hated.
[00:19:38.749 --> 00:19:44.371]  But when we get back, just what he had to say about ending tyranny in the world.
[00:19:45.332 --> 00:19:52.595]  Now by every yardstick, by every measurement, the globalists that control our government and the puppet Bush
[00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:57.059]  Are setting up worldwide tyranny.
[00:19:57.639 --> 00:19:58.600]  There's no debating that.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.240]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:04.842]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:20:05.082 --> 00:20:07.122]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:20:07.263 --> 00:20:14.425]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:20:14.585 --> 00:20:23.188]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:21:02.807 --> 00:21:05.089]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:08.111]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:14.746]  It includes the history of U.S.

[00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:05.250]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.511]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:12.531]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.132]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:22:15.312 --> 00:22:23.954]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:22:24.154 --> 00:22:25.514]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:22:25.694 --> 00:22:29.855]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:30.636]  We're good to go!
[00:22:49.198 --> 00:22:50.862]  Screams and stagnant ponds.
[00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:53.908]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:23.012 --> 00:23:27.774]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:23:28.054 --> 00:23:31.835]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:37.057]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:23:51.945 --> 00:23:52.486]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[00:24:18.888 --> 00:24:20.550]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.250]  until 2 p.m.
[00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.231]  Central Standard Time.
[00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.131]  We're here live, folks.
[00:24:23.492 --> 00:24:24.952]  And, of course, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:24:25.813 --> 00:24:35.880]  But just listen to, listen to just a little segment, or I'll just read it, from Bush's speech last night, State of the Union.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.881]  This is the fifth paragraph.
[00:24:38.902 --> 00:24:44.625]  And he says, abroad, our nation is committed to a historic long-term goal.
[00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:49.625]  We seek to end tyranny in our world.
[00:24:50.666 --> 00:24:52.428]  So now it isn't about WMDs.
[00:24:52.528 --> 00:24:54.670]  Now it isn't about fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.692]  Now it's ending tyranny.
[00:24:56.792 --> 00:25:00.476]  But then we look at what's actually happening in Afghanistan.
[00:25:00.516 --> 00:25:03.059]  They've put in a similar tyranny.
[00:25:03.749 --> 00:25:17.119]  And in Iraq, they put most of the Ba'athists back in, and they don't allow free newspapers, and it's an absolute hellhole, and that was the Pentagon's actual plan, was to break Iraq up into three or four parts, and now they're finally openly admitting that in the press.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.801]  So, that's a fraud on its face.
[00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:20.722]  But listen to this.
[00:25:21.842 --> 00:25:25.385]  Abroad, our nation is committed to a historic, long-term goal.
[00:25:25.725 --> 00:25:29.268]  We seek the end of tyranny in our world.
[00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:45.984]  Like, warrantless spying, the military spying on peace activists, innocent individuals being charged as terrorists, homeless people sleeping on the side of the street being charged as terrorists, when you go to get a bank loan, Homeland Security checks you out.
[00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.946]  I mean, all the things we've heard about.
[00:25:49.062 --> 00:25:52.484]  Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.
[00:25:52.564 --> 00:25:57.327]  In reality, Bush says, the future security of America depends on it.
[00:25:57.387 --> 00:25:57.667]  Really?
[00:25:57.687 --> 00:26:11.196]  The Pentagon's own $6 billion a year plan, titled P-2-O-G, said they want to stimulate terrorist attacks, that the war on terror is meant to actually stimulate real terror attacks to then widen the war.
[00:26:11.856 --> 00:26:14.577]  But ignore what Rumsfeld wrote in a public document.
[00:26:14.617 --> 00:26:17.878]  You know, when he says that they want to make things worse, and he says it?
[00:26:18.258 --> 00:26:19.018]  Just ignore it.
[00:26:19.058 --> 00:26:20.938]  I'm sure it's liberal propaganda.
[00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:35.102]  On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state, 7,000 miles away, could bring murder and destruction to our country.
[00:26:36.975 --> 00:26:44.758]  Dictatorships shelter terrorists and feed resentment and radicalism and seek weapons of mass destruction.
[00:26:45.538 --> 00:26:54.921]  Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of our citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror.
[00:26:55.061 --> 00:27:01.584]  Every step towards freedom in the world makes our country safer, so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.
[00:27:02.804 --> 00:27:05.165]  Now, let's just stop there for a minute.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.761]  He implies that, in that paragraph, that Iraq attacked us.
[00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:20.184]  We saw on 9-11 what happened when a state 7,000 miles away attacked us.
[00:27:20.444 --> 00:27:22.864]  But it's nebulous.
[00:27:22.884 --> 00:27:25.005]  You don't know if he's talking about Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:27:25.265 --> 00:27:28.906]  So knowingly, he's making the two foggy.
[00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:33.207]  Then he goes on to talk about Iraq and a dictatorship.
[00:27:34.995 --> 00:27:41.418]  So he's still mixing the two, and now he says, the seeking of WMDs, you need to be invaded.
[00:27:41.718 --> 00:27:47.980]  Not that he didn't get up there and pass it to the unions and say, we know he has WMDs, we know we will find them.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.641]  Now he's not even saying that.
[00:27:49.941 --> 00:27:55.283]  Now it's, if we think you're seeking them, we're going to have to invade you.
[00:27:56.411 --> 00:28:01.434]  And remember, PNAC, written by Dick Cheney, September 2000 document, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[00:28:01.714 --> 00:28:03.155]  It's online, it's in published books.
[00:28:03.175 --> 00:28:04.395]  I mean, they're proud of it.
[00:28:04.435 --> 00:28:07.177]  Dick Cheney's own group's website has it on their site.
[00:28:07.217 --> 00:28:11.619]  It's not like it's on Infowars.com and, well, that could be what Alex claims Cheney wrote.
[00:28:11.639 --> 00:28:13.140]  I mean, you can go read what the guy wrote.
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:22.485]  And he says, no, Saddam's not a threat, but he'll be a convenient pretext to invade and use Iraq as a military base to attack Iran and Syria and for the resources.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.421]  Now that's paraphrased, but that's almost exact.
[00:28:25.461 --> 00:28:26.301]  I've got a pretty good memory.
[00:28:26.562 --> 00:28:27.142]  You can go read it.
[00:28:27.182 --> 00:28:30.643]  In fact, I think that's almost an exact repeat for you.
[00:28:30.663 --> 00:28:31.884]  I do have that skill.
[00:28:33.705 --> 00:28:43.730]  So Dick Cheney says, you know when Treasury Secretary O'Neill went public and said that he was in meetings day one and it was all about invading Iraq right when Bush was elected in January of 2001?
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.882]  And then Bush says he never said it's all a lie.
[00:28:48.142 --> 00:28:51.566]  Then we get the Energy Task Force documents, some of them, and it proves all of that.
[00:28:51.606 --> 00:28:57.611]  And then Bush's own biographer says, oh yeah, in 99 he said he was going to invade Iraq, because you can't question a war president.
[00:28:58.812 --> 00:29:01.895]  Or Richard Clarke says it, but then, oh, he's a liberal, ignore him.
[00:29:01.975 --> 00:29:02.996]  Well, forget it!
[00:29:03.036 --> 00:29:04.738]  Again, the media focuses on all those guys.
[00:29:05.018 --> 00:29:06.700]  What about Dick Cheney saying it?
[00:29:09.005 --> 00:29:10.365]  What about the Downing Street Memo?
[00:29:10.726 --> 00:29:16.027]  Where they're going, well, they're already going to invade, they're going to make up fake data about WNDs, we've got to go ahead and get behind them.
[00:29:17.687 --> 00:29:20.168]  I mean, that's declassified, that's admitted.
[00:29:21.268 --> 00:29:25.730]  So, it's not a debate that they lied about all of this.
[00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.211]  They premeditatedly did it.
[00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:31.171]  It's not like they screwed up either.
[00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:35.112]  But, I mean, that's just an example of all the deception.
[00:29:35.472 --> 00:29:38.233]  It's just everything in there is a twisting.
[00:29:39.053 --> 00:29:41.496]  So he's still implying Iraq attacked us on 9-11.
[00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:47.462]  He's still saying that now they were seeking WMDs.
[00:29:48.503 --> 00:29:49.224]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:49.625]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:50.506]  A lot more coming up.
[00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:53.168]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.629 --> 00:29:55.251]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:58.835]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.894 --> 00:30:02.995]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:30:03.315 --> 00:30:05.116]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.617]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:30:06.758 --> 00:30:07.038]  Yes.
[00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:08.199]  You neglect me.
[00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:10.340]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:30:12.121 --> 00:30:13.182]  You're the cheapest gas.
[00:30:13.502 --> 00:30:14.383]  I'm getting sick.
[00:30:14.723 --> 00:30:16.885]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:30:17.946 --> 00:30:18.426]  Wait a minute.
[00:30:18.507 --> 00:30:20.128]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:28.938]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:30:29.399 --> 00:30:34.865]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:37.488]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:30:37.628 --> 00:30:42.290]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.171]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:47.673]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[00:30:47.853 --> 00:30:51.695]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.

[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.102]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:05.402 --> 00:31:10.325]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.585 --> 00:31:14.947]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:15.247 --> 00:31:24.152]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:24.372 --> 00:31:27.974]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:28.274 --> 00:31:33.297]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.597 --> 00:31:40.320]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.801 --> 00:31:41.341]  What about you?
[00:31:42.097 --> 00:31:47.461]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:31:50.603 --> 00:31:56.027]  For thousands of years, the secret of vitality, strength, virility, and endurance was kept by the ancient Incas, until now.
[00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:26.362]  Maka, a tuberous plant that only grows in one area of the Andes Mountains, is a functional food and it contains no cholesterol, is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, five natural sterols, and seven of the nine essential amino acids.
[00:32:27.023 --> 00:32:33.268]  The folks at Vitamere have now made Maka available in powder form so that you can experience its nutritional benefits.
[00:32:33.948 --> 00:32:35.229]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Maka today.
[00:32:39.128 --> 00:32:44.610]  Maca also contains tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids not found in other foods.
[00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.312]  Try Maca, and you'll know the secret of the ancient Incas.
[00:32:48.712 --> 00:32:48.992]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:32:49.032 --> 00:32:51.253]  That's 877-817-9829, and order your Maca today.
[00:32:51.273 --> 00:32:51.513]  Maca.
[00:32:51.573 --> 00:32:52.753]  Now, you'll know the secret.
[00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:08.608]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:11.649]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:26.515]  Now keep in mind that State of the Unions were a simple report by the executive that was subservient in most respects to the legislative.
[00:33:27.552 --> 00:33:37.037]  Because the Founding Fathers said there were more people in the legislative branch, and more of a separation of powers was inherent in that branch, and so it was to be the dominant branch.
[00:33:37.478 --> 00:33:42.540]  The legislative, the executive, and the judiciary being the weakest branch.
[00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:48.083]  And believe me, folks that work in my office know, in my spare time, all I do is read history books.
[00:33:48.103 --> 00:33:49.224]  I just cannot get enough of them.
[00:33:49.524 --> 00:33:54.627]  I mean, I've read the debates, I've read the Federalist Papers, I know of what I speak.
[00:33:57.148 --> 00:34:01.850]  And so, again, the President didn't even go and give an address to Congress.
[00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:15.878]  And then, by the late 1800s, some Presidents wanted to do it, and it was looked down on as grandstanding, and they would make fun of Presidents that wanted to do it and say, oh, he's a would-be emperor.
[00:34:16.918 --> 00:34:17.579]  Seriously!
[00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:25.943]  So, now, it is about, oh, the leader, he comes in, everyone's around him, and he's running things.
[00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:35.536]  It's a total illusion, so that as you are ground under this global governance, globalism, you will blame George Bush.
[00:34:35.896 --> 00:34:40.279]  Folks, they admit he takes two naps a day on average, one of them three hours long.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.183]  He exercises from two to four hours a day.
[00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:52.869]  The guy goes around getting manicures and his hair cut and just prances around, basically.
[00:34:53.746 --> 00:35:01.871]  Prances around, dodging all of the gay porn stars that are visiting, that are in and out of the White House on a daily basis.
[00:35:02.332 --> 00:35:02.932]  Oh, don't believe me?
[00:35:02.952 --> 00:35:05.314]  Just go see my film, The Order of Death.
[00:35:05.434 --> 00:35:06.494]  Get yourself a copy of that.
[00:35:06.534 --> 00:35:10.237]  All the mainstream news about all the gay prostitutes, porn stars.
[00:35:10.257 --> 00:35:10.877]  They just can't.
[00:35:10.917 --> 00:35:12.198]  Because it's Christian conservatism.
[00:35:12.218 --> 00:35:14.720]  Of course, I'm there at the White House.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.722]  But all of that, again, is a side issue.
[00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:20.764]  We're not going to get into how the White House is like Brokeback Mountain.
[00:35:21.642 --> 00:35:25.044]  But boy, is it Brokeback Mountain in every way up there.
[00:35:26.084 --> 00:35:28.465]  Of course, Clinton liked women, that's why he's very evil.
[00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:31.367]  And I'm now being sarcastic here, folks.
[00:35:31.407 --> 00:35:35.409]  I really shouldn't digress off into just how sick these people are.
[00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:39.491]  Sick in the fact that they are total hypocrites.
[00:35:40.332 --> 00:35:42.956]  At every single level.
[00:35:43.437 --> 00:35:54.715]  And they've got everybody fooled because their puppet, not everybody, less and less people are fooled, because their puppet prances around with that fake Texas accent and that ridiculous cowboy hat.
[00:35:56.111 --> 00:36:01.756]  And I'll never get over the fact that a few years ago, Vicente Fox, who actually has a 40 plus thousand acre ranch.
[00:36:01.796 --> 00:36:03.397]  They're real cowboys in Mexico.
[00:36:03.417 --> 00:36:05.319]  In fact, cowboys come from Argentina.
[00:36:05.819 --> 00:36:07.020]  We just copied them up here.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.643]  A real cowboy, I mean, Vicente Fox really does like to rope and ride.
[00:36:11.484 --> 00:36:13.905]  He's rich, but that's what the richy-riches do down there.
[00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:18.669]  He comes up here and says, OK, you gave me a saddle, you did some stuff, let's go riding.
[00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.812]  I want to blow off some steam, go jump in some fence rows.
[00:36:21.852 --> 00:36:24.274]  And Bush said, I'm afraid of horses.
[00:36:25.197 --> 00:36:26.477]  Again, a side issue, folks.
[00:36:26.818 --> 00:36:31.999]  Just to show you how fake it all is.
[00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:35.760]  How ridiculous it is.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.421]  It is a total joke.
[00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:47.824]  I mean, folks, I know how to rope a little bit and ride a little bit, and I've tackled hundreds of steers, and I've had horses kick me, and I wasn't a real cowboy.
[00:36:48.724 --> 00:36:49.004]  Okay?
[00:36:49.770 --> 00:37:03.117]  I mean, I've been in a corral with 500 wild cows that have never even been vaccinated, who are being brought in to be dehorned, and they're all trying to kill you, and I'm in there with a cattle prod.
[00:37:03.337 --> 00:37:04.398]  And I'm not a real cowboy.
[00:37:04.618 --> 00:37:11.241]  And imagine what it's like for me to have to sit there and look at George Bush making my state look bad.
[00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:14.163]  He's a carpet-bagging piece of trash.
[00:37:15.106 --> 00:37:15.506]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:15.607 --> 00:37:15.847]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:16.367]  He's a puppet.
[00:37:16.407 --> 00:37:17.008]  I remember that.
[00:37:17.028 --> 00:37:18.189]  I just, I'm so sick of him.
[00:37:18.729 --> 00:37:21.452]  And by the way, folks, I don't care if you're from up north and you live down here.
[00:37:22.093 --> 00:37:28.058]  If I was to move up to New York and start telling you how to do things and making New York look bad, I'd be a carpetbagger.
[00:37:28.539 --> 00:37:33.543]  All it means is, is somebody from out of your region coming in and trying to take advantage of you.
[00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:37.807]  And there are a lot of dirty carpetbaggers.
[00:37:38.668 --> 00:37:39.709]  And I'm sick of them.
[00:37:40.305 --> 00:37:42.046]  Alright, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:37:42.106 --> 00:37:45.167]  See, I'm digressing, and I'm getting angry, and I apologize.
[00:37:48.048 --> 00:37:59.611]  Look, I'm just going to play one more clip of Bush, and this is where he's talking about Iraq, and talking about how evil Bin Laden is, and how Bin Laden is going to get us an amendment.
[00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:04.173]  And I'm going to go back and play a clip where he says he doesn't want Bin Laden, and isn't worried about Bin Laden.
[00:38:04.193 --> 00:38:06.994]  But let's go ahead and play another clip of Lord Bush last night.
[00:38:07.034 --> 00:38:07.334]  Here it is.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.341]  No one can deny the success of freedom.
[00:38:12.981 --> 00:38:14.842]  But some men rage and fight against it.
[00:38:16.562 --> 00:38:20.043]  And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam.
[00:38:21.364 --> 00:38:26.645]  The perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.
[00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:31.026]  Terrorists like Bin Laden are serious about mass murder.
[00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:36.188]  And all of us must take their declared intentions seriously.
[00:38:38.018 --> 00:38:45.423]  They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.
[00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:53.548]  Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world.
[00:38:55.149 --> 00:39:07.778]  Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear when they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters
[00:39:08.536 --> 00:39:21.046]  Alright, so every one of the instances he named were government-sponsored terror events, signed, certified, 110% proven, no debate, orgy of evidence, unbelievable amounts of evidence, sloppy jobs.
[00:39:36.286 --> 00:39:42.753]  I mean, I could have, again, John Loftis, former head of counterterrorism for the FBI on, to go, yeah, SWAT's MI6, yeah, looks like the government did it.
[00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.938]  I mean, he's got to get a national ABC radio show.
[00:39:47.378 --> 00:39:48.179]  I had him on, he said it.
[00:39:49.702 --> 00:39:50.242]  How many other?
[00:39:50.863 --> 00:39:54.405]  A few weeks ago, I had on those two top CIA guys, and one of them ran the hunt for Bin Laden.
[00:39:54.445 --> 00:39:57.287]  I go, did our government carry out terror attacks and I ran to blame it on Mossadegh?
[00:39:57.327 --> 00:39:57.968]  Well, yes, they did.
[00:39:58.008 --> 00:39:58.608]  That's admitted.
[00:39:59.148 --> 00:40:00.870]  Well, did our government do this with the Gulf of Tonkin?
[00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.810]  Well, yes, that's admitted.
[00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.132]  It's all admitted, and I'm sick of it!
[00:40:04.352 --> 00:40:05.913]  You're the ones that live off fear!
[00:40:06.073 --> 00:40:13.218]  You're the ones constantly trying to scare the daylights out of us on the news, and issuing terror alerts whenever you get caught with your hand in a Halliburton cookie jar!
[00:40:13.758 --> 00:40:18.582]  Don't sit there and tell me about how the terrorists are going to get us and how they use fear.
[00:40:18.622 --> 00:40:19.662]  You guys use fear.
[00:40:19.702 --> 00:40:20.763]  You are the terrorists.
[00:40:22.004 --> 00:40:24.286]  Your bosses are the terrorists.
[00:40:25.587 --> 00:40:29.189]  Now here's Bush who's telling us how Bin Laden is going to get us any minute and how evil he is.
[00:40:29.489 --> 00:40:31.291]  Here he is just a year or so ago.
[00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:35.073]  I've got a whole bunch of these clips saying he's not worried about them and doesn't care where he is.
[00:40:35.093 --> 00:40:35.654]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:40:37.878 --> 00:40:42.362]  Well, as I say, we hadn't heard much from him.
[00:40:42.882 --> 00:40:47.186]  And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure.
[00:40:48.286 --> 00:40:50.148]  And, you know, again, I don't know where he is.
[00:40:50.168 --> 00:40:55.712]  I repeat what I said.
[00:40:55.772 --> 00:40:57.494]  I truly am not that concerned about him.
[00:40:57.574 --> 00:40:58.534]  I know he is on the run.
[00:40:58.574 --> 00:41:01.697]  I was concerned about him when he had taken over a country.
[00:41:03.777 --> 00:41:10.825]  I was concerned about the fact that he was basically running Afghanistan and calling the shots for the Taliban.
[00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:21.398]  But once he set out the policy and started executing the plan, we shoved him out more and more on the margins.
[00:41:22.108 --> 00:41:25.269]  He has no place to train his Al Qaeda killers anymore.
[00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:26.269]  Okay, there you go.
[00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:31.831]  But then when the NSA is spying on us, it's because, hey, Bin Laden wants to get us and I'm doing everything I can to bring him to justice.
[00:41:32.131 --> 00:41:34.752]  Meanwhile, we get CIA reports going, we don't want to capture him.
[00:41:34.972 --> 00:41:37.052]  Well, no kidding, you don't want to capture your asset.
[00:41:37.872 --> 00:41:41.333]  And again, it's public record that the guy was trained by the U.S.
[00:41:41.614 --> 00:41:42.954]  and worked for him and still does.
[00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:47.140]  I mean, imagine how bizarre that is.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.782]  It's known that the Bushes, quote, vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:41:50.882 --> 00:41:54.204]  FBI agent Robert Wright, C-SPAN National TV, 2002.
[00:41:55.644 --> 00:41:57.005]  I mean, imagine how weird that is.
[00:41:57.045 --> 00:42:14.794]  It just so happens that they sit on the board, the Bin Ladens, the Bushes, and the Queen of England, of Carlisle Group, and it just so happens that, uh, some of the Bin Ladens just so happens to have been CIA, and it just so happens that they always tell the troops not to capture them when they're about to, and it just so happens that they told NORAD to stand down,
[00:42:15.034 --> 00:42:21.359]  And it just so happens they were running drills at the exact same time that the exact same attacks happened at the exact same places in every case.
[00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:26.343]  And it just so happens that they called all these public officials and told them about the flight to New York the night before.
[00:42:26.623 --> 00:42:31.527]  And it just so happens on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:42:31.607 --> 00:42:39.614]  And it just so happens that the people controlling our government have the motive to carry out terror so they can then tell us to shut up and go ahead with their agenda.
[00:42:39.634 --> 00:42:42.095]  We're going to go to your calls in a minute.
[00:42:42.115 --> 00:42:42.536]  It's just
[00:42:44.168 --> 00:42:45.048]  It's just amazing.
[00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:48.789]  It's amazing to see this happening.
[00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:50.910]  Meanwhile, every day I see articles in the U.S.
[00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:54.511]  and England where all protesters are being watched by the Army.
[00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:55.972]  They're registering you.
[00:42:56.012 --> 00:42:57.332]  They're videotaping us.
[00:42:57.372 --> 00:42:58.672]  They're putting us in these systems.
[00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:01.373]  Halliburton is going to build concentration camps.
[00:43:01.813 --> 00:43:03.714]  That is mainstream news.
[00:43:04.274 --> 00:43:05.455]  Of course they're for your safety.
[00:43:06.935 --> 00:43:07.455]  Halliburton.
[00:43:07.475 --> 00:43:09.056]  The same ones that run the camps in Iraq.
[00:43:09.076 --> 00:43:10.776]  The same ones involved in child kidnapping.
[00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:11.736]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:43:11.936 --> 00:43:13.437]  I mean, these are evil people, folks.
[00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:20.192]  I mean, do you think Haliburton and these guys just let... I mean, I know there's a lot of people listening right now that go, that guy's nuts, he's just making that up.
[00:43:20.352 --> 00:43:27.414]  Do you really think they let me get up here, on what is it now, like 80-something AM and FM stations, and sit here and say all this if it isn't true?
[00:43:27.434 --> 00:43:29.014]  Do you know how the world works?
[00:43:29.214 --> 00:43:32.055]  If I said anything that wasn't true, I'd be sued out of existence!
[00:43:32.355 --> 00:43:34.896]  Everything I talk about is documented and preplicate!
[00:43:37.057 --> 00:43:40.418]  So don't just sit there, because you're lazy, and say, what I'm saying isn't true.
[00:43:40.678 --> 00:43:41.358]  It is true!
[00:43:42.893 --> 00:43:44.474]  Believe me, I wish it wasn't.
[00:43:44.814 --> 00:43:46.434]  And I'm sorry this stuff's scary.
[00:43:46.854 --> 00:43:48.115]  Look, I didn't make it this way.
[00:43:48.335 --> 00:43:49.815]  I didn't go out and do this.
[00:43:49.855 --> 00:43:52.476]  It's not my fault that I'm here warning you.
[00:43:53.216 --> 00:43:54.837]  It'd be like if the dam had just broke.
[00:43:57.018 --> 00:43:59.638]  Some huge dam above a little town of 10,000 down in the valley.
[00:44:00.919 --> 00:44:05.980]  And I jumped on the community loudspeaker system and said, there's a wall of water a hundred feet tall coming your way.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.781]  You got five minutes to get to high ground.
[00:44:10.968 --> 00:44:14.211]  And then the water hit and covered the town up and killed a bunch of people.
[00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:21.037]  And then 20 years later, somebody else did it and the dam broke again.
[00:44:21.057 --> 00:44:22.018]  This is a bad analogy.
[00:44:22.038 --> 00:44:24.761]  And then the people said, well, you know what?
[00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:27.684]  We're mad at you because you told us that the dam broke.
[00:44:27.924 --> 00:44:31.327]  You see, because I didn't just say it broke and then you don't know if it broke.
[00:44:31.487 --> 00:44:32.428]  I can prove it broke.
[00:44:32.508 --> 00:44:35.431]  I can prove it's already swallowed us up many, many times.
[00:44:38.755 --> 00:44:40.877]  I said I'd air this, so we'll air this.
[00:44:41.777 --> 00:44:44.279]  This digresses, but at the same time it doesn't.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.002]  Because finally, Jon Stewart's done something that is near and dear to my heart.
[00:44:49.263 --> 00:45:00.491]  Why is the media so upset about this book, A Million Little Pieces, and the guy lying, but then they act like it's no big deal when the government lies.
[00:45:00.791 --> 00:45:03.293]  You see, they can't go expose a real government lie
[00:45:04.959 --> 00:45:08.681]  Because that would then actually affect something and it might actually wake the people up.
[00:45:08.721 --> 00:45:08.901]  No!
[00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:15.983]  They'll have a big fake investigation about some little petty nothingness and then Oprah Winfrey will puff herself up and act all angry.
[00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:18.264]  And I'm telling you folks, this is all stage for publicity.
[00:45:20.325 --> 00:45:26.687]  And then that's a big nightly news issue that some books are live and we're all upset about that and it's top news story for a week.
[00:45:27.228 --> 00:45:27.848]  Meanwhile,
[00:45:28.712 --> 00:45:32.875]  The government is engaged in mass crimes on a gargantuan scale.
[00:45:33.055 --> 00:45:36.578]  I mean, ask Oprah why she won't talk about the Dinecore and Halliburton kidnapping rings.
[00:45:38.479 --> 00:45:38.799]  Ask her!
[00:45:38.939 --> 00:45:39.299]  Come on!
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.300]  Come on!
[00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:43.262]  Go ahead and roll it and then we'll take calls.
[00:45:44.883 --> 00:45:45.684]  The big fish.
[00:45:46.405 --> 00:45:49.646]  And now some dramatic allegations about a celebrated author.
[00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.686]  The man who conned Oprah.
[00:45:51.746 --> 00:45:55.807]  Tonight there is an explosive controversy over a book promoted by Oprah Winfrey.
[00:45:55.867 --> 00:46:03.008]  Now there are accusations that this searing piece of self-confession is actually in large part a work of fiction.
[00:46:03.709 --> 00:46:11.290]  I say to you today that this nation will not stand for the misclassification of its literature.
[00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:14.031]  We will not stand.
[00:46:14.331 --> 00:46:14.911]  Vote for me.
[00:46:15.825 --> 00:46:20.668]  Yes, by now you know, author James Fry has been ripped into, oh, I'd say numerous pieces.
[00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:25.292]  Over revelations he lied in his memoir, A Million Little Pieces.
[00:46:25.632 --> 00:46:31.696]  All of those encounters where there are the big fights and chairs and you're Mr. Bravado, tough guy.
[00:46:32.697 --> 00:46:36.119]  When you're making that up, I really feel duped.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.480]  I feel duped.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.563]  But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed
[00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:43.331]  Millions of readers.
[00:46:43.871 --> 00:46:45.572]  In other words, you don't get a car!
[00:46:45.872 --> 00:46:47.933]  You don't get a car!
[00:46:48.654 --> 00:47:01.762]  By the way, don't you think, if I may say, don't you think it's going to be one entertaining hour of television when Oprah realizes Dr. Phil is full of s***?
[00:47:02.002 --> 00:47:07.365]  That's going to be a good hour of television.
[00:47:07.605 --> 00:47:12.008]  So, within the confines of Oprah's book club, truth prevails.
[00:47:12.682 --> 00:47:18.926]  And the following news cycle was dominated by the scandal and the larger lessons for all of us.
[00:47:19.506 --> 00:47:20.747]  Do not piss off Oprah.
[00:47:20.987 --> 00:47:22.989]  Oprah's power is undeniable, so is her anger.
[00:47:23.049 --> 00:47:27.231]  Boy, I'll tell you what, she took James Fry to the woodshed on live television today.
[00:47:27.251 --> 00:47:32.135]  And in the world according to Oprah, for people who fib, there are consequences.
[00:47:37.978 --> 00:47:39.799]  Consequences for those who fib.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.101]  Reporters were stunned!
[00:47:44.116 --> 00:47:47.277]  That someone investigated a lie and declared it to be untrue.
[00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:53.018]  You see, in the news world, TV interviews work more like this.
[00:47:53.038 --> 00:47:56.638]  Do you have fair shake in media on the economy?
[00:47:56.658 --> 00:47:58.979]  Isn't the economy kind of an underrated story?
[00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:00.419]  Isn't it?
[00:48:00.879 --> 00:48:05.220]  But for people who lie in Oprah's world, there are consequences.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.020]  In this world, apparently, gift baskets.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.680]  Again, Oprah's world.
[00:48:09.001 --> 00:48:11.261]  You know, since that time, I've struggled with, uh,
[00:48:12.452 --> 00:48:13.733]  The idea of it.
[00:48:13.753 --> 00:48:15.054]  No, the lie of it.
[00:48:16.155 --> 00:48:16.836]  That's a lie.
[00:48:16.856 --> 00:48:18.437]  Not an idea, James.
[00:48:18.657 --> 00:48:20.378]  That's a lie.
[00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:21.379]  The news world.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.621]  You are the president.
[00:48:24.642 --> 00:48:31.948]  When you stand up there on that balcony and look out and see the Washington Monument, as a president, how does that feel?
[00:48:32.949 --> 00:48:37.573]  I view it as an American thing.
[00:48:38.193 --> 00:48:39.294]  Let's go back to Oprah's world.
[00:48:40.071 --> 00:48:43.592]  Was your description of how she died true?
[00:48:43.892 --> 00:48:47.773]  She committed suicide, yes.
[00:48:47.833 --> 00:48:48.393]  She hung herself.
[00:48:48.973 --> 00:48:53.874]  I mean, that was one of the details I altered about her.
[00:48:57.354 --> 00:48:58.775]  Let's go back to our world!
[00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:03.836]  Alright, so you and Dick Cheney aren't the torture guys that the New York Times says you are.
[00:49:03.936 --> 00:49:04.936]  Goodness gracious.
[00:49:09.862 --> 00:49:11.383]  I mean, gee willikers!
[00:49:12.723 --> 00:49:15.684]  Why does James Fry get tougher treatment than our government?
[00:49:16.944 --> 00:49:17.785]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:49:17.845 --> 00:49:19.185]  Because he misled us.
[00:49:20.005 --> 00:49:22.486]  Into a book we had no business getting into.
[00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:23.666]  So thank you, Oprah.
[00:49:24.407 --> 00:49:29.328]  For giving us a glimpse into the world of personal accountability.
[00:49:30.448 --> 00:49:33.529]  And punishing the one unforgivable sin in our society.
[00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.590]  Forcing Americans to read.
[00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:38.751]  When they didn't really have to.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.561]  We'll be right back.
[00:49:41.301 --> 00:49:42.863]  Would you read another James Fry book?
[00:49:47.047 --> 00:49:48.869]  Lily, would you read another book by James Fry?
[00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:51.552]  Lily, if you can hear me, are you there?
[00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:53.214]  I think that's Lily from the actual book.
[00:49:59.216 --> 00:50:01.277]  So the point is they're all acting real serious.
[00:50:01.337 --> 00:50:02.238]  An analysis.
[00:50:02.378 --> 00:50:03.259]  Is it true?
[00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:04.760]  Was he in a drug rehab?
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.140]  Did the girl die?
[00:50:06.481 --> 00:50:09.002]  Tonight, massive coverage with our analyst.
[00:50:09.062 --> 00:50:10.243]  It's so important.
[00:50:10.443 --> 00:50:11.384]  He lied.
[00:50:11.444 --> 00:50:12.404]  Everyone's upset.
[00:50:12.865 --> 00:50:21.330]  Meanwhile, almost everything you see on the news is a twisted or spun or just outright fabrication.
[00:50:22.213 --> 00:50:29.284]  I mean, and you can verify its lies in about 10 seconds, because there's two different groups of news, and there's subsections of all of those.
[00:50:29.524 --> 00:50:37.076]  There's the real news and the news wires and the documents and the trade publications that never gets wide circulation, that's there for everybody, who's an analyst.
[00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:39.973]  And then there's the stuff that's on the nightly news.
[00:50:40.013 --> 00:50:43.236]  And it's all just about stupid little books and did this guy a lot.
[00:50:43.677 --> 00:50:48.941]  Because they can only talk about corruption and expose corruption that is petty and isolated and doesn't matter.
[00:50:49.222 --> 00:50:51.504]  That's why they couldn't go after Clinton for missile secrets.
[00:50:51.524 --> 00:50:55.688]  They had to go after him for sex because that was the only thing he was doing that was isolated.
[00:50:56.008 --> 00:50:58.890]  Everybody else was dirty so they couldn't go after anything big.
[00:50:59.171 --> 00:51:00.232]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[00:51:00.252 --> 00:51:00.612]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:05.800]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.661]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:12.664]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.005 --> 00:51:19.749]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:22.051]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:25.094]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.194 --> 00:51:29.858]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.058 --> 00:51:34.462]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.702 --> 00:51:41.929]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:52:02.794 --> 00:52:05.777]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:06.137 --> 00:52:14.946]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:15.286 --> 00:52:19.951]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:20.411 --> 00:52:27.133]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:27.533 --> 00:52:39.317]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:39.797 --> 00:52:44.259]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:44.419 --> 00:52:46.879]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.561]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:03.556 --> 00:53:03.856]  Thank you.
[00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:19.342]  I think so.
[00:53:38.919 --> 00:53:39.179]  I think so.
[00:54:03.062 --> 00:54:08.125]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll play Bush talking about spying.
[00:54:08.385 --> 00:54:11.147]  And again, it's all a provable, verifiable lie.
[00:54:12.788 --> 00:54:16.090]  And we've got writings of Colin Powell and others saying it's illegal.
[00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.051]  Ashcroft even warning him that it was illegal.
[00:54:18.551 --> 00:54:19.712]  You can find all of this.
[00:54:20.292 --> 00:54:22.354]  But Bush gets up there and admits he did it.
[00:54:22.674 --> 00:54:25.275]  Then his other surrogates say, oh no, we didn't spy.
[00:54:25.335 --> 00:54:28.437]  So, I mean, pick a lie, any lie, and just jump in.
[00:54:28.497 --> 00:54:29.738]  But again, Bush is just a puppet.
[00:54:30.658 --> 00:54:36.484]  Jim, Ed, and Ida and others, we're going to be going to your calls and open phones the whole next hour.
[00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:38.566]  And I've got several other audio clips.
[00:54:38.606 --> 00:54:43.791]  I've got this little Bush the Emperor comedy piece done by the animator Mark Fiore.
[00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:45.052]  He's always very talented.
[00:54:45.332 --> 00:54:47.054]  We're going to play that coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:47.094 --> 00:54:52.579]  And the really scary news, we've saved the worst for the middle of the show, the private
[00:54:54.136 --> 00:54:54.756]  FEMA camps.
[00:54:55.017 --> 00:54:55.477]  FEMA camps.
[00:54:55.497 --> 00:54:57.538]  Just, you know, we're building some camps for you.
[00:54:57.838 --> 00:54:59.339]  Houston Chronicle, AP.
[00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:00.279]  Hey!
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.620]  Halliburton's going to run them.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:02.821]  Hey!
[00:55:02.841 --> 00:55:08.404]  And a known death squad founder and commander, Negroponte, is orchestrating it all.
[00:55:08.444 --> 00:55:08.804]  Hey!
[00:55:08.884 --> 00:55:09.564]  All right!
[00:55:10.325 --> 00:55:13.406]  So that is coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:55:15.207 --> 00:55:17.649]  President is announcing that he has dictatorial power.
[00:55:18.978 --> 00:55:22.706]  Is now giving his private cronies private family camps.
[00:55:22.827 --> 00:55:24.350]  It's really nice.
[00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:28.480]  But before I go to Jim and Ed and everybody else that's patiently holding
[00:55:29.153 --> 00:55:34.315]  Just briefly here, folks, I want you to get my documentary films, and I want you to do something very important.
[00:55:34.736 --> 00:55:36.056]  Make copies of them.
[00:55:36.216 --> 00:55:50.983]  In that act of getting my films, you support what we're doing, you get powerful, informative, dynamic documentaries, some of the best out there, bar none, give you wide-spectrum data info on the New World Order program and its architecture and how to bring them down, how to stop them, how to smash them.
[00:55:52.145 --> 00:55:55.887]  But then you're also able to make copies and force multiply the information.
[00:55:55.927 --> 00:55:58.548]  The power of you doing that is unbelievable.
[00:55:58.568 --> 00:56:01.830]  So I want to salute, commend, thank all those that have in the past.
[00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:05.251]  Go to InfoWars.com and look at all the specials that are up there.
[00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:08.113]  I mean, we just continue to come out with better and better specials.
[00:56:08.793 --> 00:56:11.474]  We've got that Synthetic Terror book special along with Martial Law.
[00:56:12.074 --> 00:56:14.195]  One of my newest and best films together for $29.95.
[00:56:16.115 --> 00:56:16.995]  What is that, like a $15 discount?
[00:56:17.076 --> 00:56:17.876]  I mean, normally the film's $24.95.
[00:56:17.936 --> 00:56:19.377]  You get like a 500 plus page book basically for $5.
[00:56:19.537 --> 00:56:19.857]  It's up on...
[00:56:27.418 --> 00:56:42.163]  It's up on InfoWars.com via the secure online shopping cart or call toll free right now 1-888-253-3139 to order at an incredible activist center PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:42.543 --> 00:56:47.365]  All 14 of my films, dozens of other great films, we've been authorized to post, like Loose Change 2.
[00:56:47.885 --> 00:56:48.465]  Oh, it's good!
[00:56:48.865 --> 00:56:49.565]  By Dylan Avery.
[00:56:49.965 --> 00:56:51.346]  Go there, get a membership and you can
[00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:55.927]  Hey Alex, you were saying about how most guys are stupid and only know about football.
[00:57:22.386 --> 00:57:25.387]  Maybe if we want to reach these guys we should try to reach them on their level.
[00:57:26.827 --> 00:57:35.030]  A guy named Dan Modia, he wrote a book called Interference about how the NFL fixes games and how the owners all have like mafia connections.
[00:57:35.971 --> 00:57:41.652]  And he was saying most of the owners are like Catholic, Masonic, Knights of Malta and they all have diplomatic immunity.
[00:57:42.413 --> 00:57:49.015]  He was just saying it's just one big mafia organization and that they script like, you know, all the storylines and everything they do in the NFL.
[00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:53.053]  And I bet you're going to tell me that Pete Rose bet on baseball.
[00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:54.836]  No, it's totally clean.
[00:57:55.277 --> 00:57:56.320]  Don King's clean.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.362]  Boxing's clean.
[00:57:57.402 --> 00:57:58.184]  Everything's fine.
[00:57:58.915 --> 00:58:02.237]  Yeah, he was on Coast to Coast one time, but he didn't talk about how football was fixed.
[00:58:02.737 --> 00:58:05.699]  Well, I mean, I don't think that football is fixed to that level.
[00:58:05.719 --> 00:58:06.619]  I've actually studied it.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.201]  Let me tell you, what is fixed is most of the lotteries.
[00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:12.883]  I mean, that is totally staged, folks, the big ticket.
[00:58:13.263 --> 00:58:20.047]  But as for the Catholics controlling it, I mean, it's like there's been a rash of calls the last two weeks about
[00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:22.232]  There's Catholics behind everything.
[00:58:22.252 --> 00:58:23.993]  And I'm not a Catholic, but I've got a lot of Catholic friends.
[00:58:24.013 --> 00:58:25.234]  I've researched it.
[00:58:26.334 --> 00:58:27.495]  I'd like to see your proof.
[00:58:27.875 --> 00:58:33.879]  Maybe I should interview that guy that the Catholic Church controls the National Football League.
[00:58:34.819 --> 00:58:35.180]  Oh boy.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.180]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:36.541]  Stay with us.
[00:58:36.561 --> 00:58:40.843]  It's the second hour coming up.
[00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:46.186]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.851 --> 00:58:58.512]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.172 --> 00:59:00.213]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.933 --> 00:59:02.034]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.675 --> 00:59:03.515]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.256 --> 00:59:06.197]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.217 --> 00:59:09.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:14.123]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.905 --> 00:59:20.508]  Well, Cindy Skehan got arrested last night and up on InfoWars.com.
[00:59:21.429 --> 00:59:25.152]  Right now we're posting, um, she just got, you know, basically out of the hush cow.
[00:59:25.512 --> 00:59:26.853]  We're posting what happened to her.
[00:59:27.876 --> 00:59:29.238]  She's wearing a t-shirt they didn't like.
[00:59:29.538 --> 00:59:31.140]  Didn't matter if a congressman brought her there.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.564]  It just shows you the police state level we're talking about.
[00:59:34.584 --> 00:59:37.588]  It doesn't matter how bad PR was for Bush, they still did it.
[00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:41.853]  Halliburton is going to run concentration camps in America.
[00:59:41.893 --> 00:59:43.035]  That's mainstream news.
[00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:46.319]  We're going to play some more clips of the State of the Union by The Puppet.
[00:59:46.986 --> 00:59:52.008]  You know, these world leaders and stuff, I think people of the Christian faith, they need to sign prior to the abominations of this world.
[00:59:52.028 --> 00:59:53.448]  They need to be meek and humble about this.
[01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:18.458]  We need to pray for our enemies.
[01:00:19.018 --> 01:00:19.839]  Love our enemies.
[01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:21.180]  As Jesus said.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.844]  But you know, there's something in the sky where people need to think about it because it's been hit by the government.
[01:00:27.664 --> 01:00:29.105]  It's in Revelation Chapter 8.
[01:00:29.245 --> 01:00:31.667]  It goes over this.
[01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:32.827]  It's verse 11.
[01:00:32.867 --> 01:00:36.890]  And the name of the star is called Wormwood, which in the Greek is Calamity.
[01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:42.194]  And the third part of the waters became Wormwood, which is Calamity.
[01:00:42.254 --> 01:00:45.656]  And many men died at the bitter waters because they were made bitter.
[01:00:46.516 --> 01:00:47.817]  There's something in the sky.
[01:00:48.157 --> 01:00:52.840]  It was discovered in 1982 called Planet X. Oh, please.
[01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:53.981]  And it's coming.
[01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:57.864]  It's heading towards Earth and will pass by the Earth soon.
[01:00:58.424 --> 01:00:59.705]  The government knows about this.
[01:00:59.725 --> 01:01:01.226]  They're keeping a hit from the people.
[01:01:02.107 --> 01:01:04.028]  And this is the truth that I say.
[01:01:04.048 --> 01:01:07.951]  You say the truth also, Mr. Jones, and I tell the truth also.
[01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:09.672]  A warning to the people.
[01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:12.938]  They need to be ready and take cover from this.
[01:01:20.714 --> 01:01:27.601]  A couple books came out guaranteeing that Planet X was going to either hit the Earth or go right by it three years ago.
[01:01:27.881 --> 01:01:29.042]  They said in three years it would happen.
[01:01:29.062 --> 01:01:30.123]  It didn't happen.
[01:01:30.143 --> 01:01:36.409]  And then I predicted when it didn't happen they'd say it was the Gregorian calendar and it was really a three year difference and then it didn't kill us.
[01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:39.412]  Do meteorites hit the Earth?
[01:01:39.472 --> 01:01:41.995]  Do small planetoids collide with other heavenly bodies?
[01:01:42.435 --> 01:01:42.775]  Yes.
[01:01:42.915 --> 01:01:43.936]  Have we had calamities?
[01:01:44.017 --> 01:01:44.337]  Yes.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.300]  Have they found a 10th, 11th, 12th?
[01:01:47.381 --> 01:01:51.381]  They found a bunch of rocks bigger than Pluto out past now.
[01:01:52.002 --> 01:01:57.743]  And they even named a 10th planet last year, but they're not in an elliptical orbit, and they're not killing us.
[01:01:58.463 --> 01:02:03.164]  And I'm not saying that isn't going to happen, but it's just really kind of the wrong show.
[01:02:04.684 --> 01:02:06.665]  Because, I mean, here's an example.
[01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:09.745]  I'll get calls every week about the imaginary concentration camps.
[01:02:10.186 --> 01:02:11.946]  I heard from a truck driver who saw one.
[01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:17.225]  But I don't know the truck driver's name, or I heard from a truck driver who talked to a guy who talked to a guy who saw one.
[01:02:17.585 --> 01:02:24.489]  But I've got on PrisonPlanet.com an article today, Paul Watson put together, with a whole bunch of mainstream news articles admitting camps for you and your family.
[01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:26.770]  I've been and watched the military train to put you in them.
[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.912]  But somehow there's a disconnect where people will not focus on that.
[01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:38.717]  I mean, where we've got the government planning to do it, it's just kind of like a disassociative people kind of turn away from it.
[01:02:40.342 --> 01:02:49.809]  And yeah, saying there's going to be a go off to Mars, saying there's going to be earthquakes, or saying that all of this stuff's going to happen, it's very interesting, it's intriguing, it gets ratings.
[01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.412]  I don't knock those that decide they want to talk about this.
[01:02:53.912 --> 01:02:57.095]  And the comeback I get from these people is, well, it could happen.
[01:02:58.296 --> 01:03:07.583]  Well, yeah, and my garden gnome could come alive and grow 100 foot fangs and climb a stairway to heaven before he pogo sticks down the drain.
[01:03:09.174 --> 01:03:15.657]  Toucan Sam could come flying out of a Froot Loops box and bite me on the nose, but it's not going to happen, folks.
[01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:16.757]  Okay?
[01:03:17.598 --> 01:03:22.880]  And I'm not saying that we won't be hit by asteroids.
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.441]  I'm not saying that that's not going to happen.
[01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:32.664]  But to say Planet X, the purveyors of this, who put all this out, haven't been held to account.
[01:03:33.284 --> 01:03:37.206]  They're back now with new books selling them, saying it's going to hit us in three years again.
[01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:43.215]  And, uh, this broadcast is about credibility.
[01:03:44.717 --> 01:03:49.221]  Everything we talk about is documented.
[01:03:50.523 --> 01:03:51.364]  No chubacabras.
[01:03:54.415 --> 01:04:01.819]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:06.801]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:07.021 --> 01:04:12.664]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.904 --> 01:04:17.428]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.648 --> 01:04:24.813]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:29.377]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.537 --> 01:04:32.039]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:32.279 --> 01:04:38.984]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:04:39.224 --> 01:04:44.471]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:44.911]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:54.329 --> 01:05:03.397]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.637 --> 01:05:14.887]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:15.227 --> 01:05:20.932]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:21.172 --> 01:05:27.815]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.035 --> 01:05:34.859]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.900]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.201]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:05:39.421 --> 01:05:41.122]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.

[01:05:53.768 --> 01:05:58.210]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:02.071]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:10.315]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:16.238]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:06:16.518 --> 01:06:21.781]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:24.102]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:06:24.382 --> 01:06:36.529]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:06:36.769 --> 01:06:41.191]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:06:41.391 --> 01:06:42.351]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.152]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.392]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:06:45.412 --> 01:06:45.672]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:06:45.692 --> 01:06:46.212]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:06:46.233 --> 01:06:49.014]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:49.094 --> 01:06:50.574]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:02.793 --> 01:07:14.362]  I want to continue with your phone calls, play some more clips of the State of the Union that is all designed to make you think the President is running something so that he'll take the blame for what the elite is doing.
[01:07:14.402 --> 01:07:22.148]  I want to get into Halliburton and mainstream news with its FEMA camps, concentration camps, for your safety of course though, and so much more.
[01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:26.632]  Before I go to Ida and Don and Brian and Mike and Mike and many others,
[01:07:28.266 --> 01:07:29.587]  I just want to mention something.
[01:07:30.007 --> 01:07:37.772]  I was driving along listening to local talk radio last night and heard the talk show host, and I commend him, talking about Aspartame.
[01:07:38.332 --> 01:07:55.963]  And I, I mean years ago, I probably did 20, 30 shows, more than that, with medical doctors, brain surgeons, people that study the brain, just, I guess you call them neurologists, all of these incredible experts.
[01:07:58.363 --> 01:08:04.488]  And I covered hundreds of studies on air, and for years I just kind of, okay, I'm moving on from that.
[01:08:05.189 --> 01:08:08.511]  I did probably 50 shows on sodium and stannous fluoride.
[01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:15.897]  But I was listening to the talk show host, and he was reading documents that I've covered on air, and it was reminding me.
[01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:22.903]  It was actually George Gordon, who does a pretty good job on his radio show.
[01:08:23.718 --> 01:08:26.579]  But he was going over admitted documents, and I remember reading them.
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:41.887]  Did you know back in 1971 to 1973 at the University Medical Center there in Wisconsin, at the big John F. Kennedy Medical Ward, this top scientist, well, what was his name?
[01:08:42.367 --> 01:08:46.769]  I mean, I just heard him talk about it last night, and it reminded me of all the documents I'd read years ago.
[01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:48.330]  My memory's good, but not that good.
[01:08:49.483 --> 01:09:10.884]  Wiseman, this top scientist Wiseman, Monsanto, at that time Sherrill was the name, they changed names, they went and hired him and thirteen other studies at the same time, to go and study primates, monkeys, being given aspartate.
[01:09:12.328 --> 01:09:26.996]  And in one of the studies, they gave seven infant healthy rhesus monkeys, whose metabolisms are very similar to Homo sapiens sapiens, that's us folks, humans, very similar in the metabolism.
[01:09:28.485 --> 01:09:32.086]  They gave them low levels of it with their mother's milks.
[01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:36.787]  They were getting all the vitamins and nutrients they needed from the mother's milk, and they added just low levels in it.
[01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:45.949]  One died, and another five had grand mal seizures, clenching teeth, flopping around, and had holes in their brains.
[01:09:47.009 --> 01:09:51.930]  So he brought this to them, but one monkey, because some of it was really tough, one monkey did okay.
[01:09:53.206 --> 01:09:56.327]  Actually, the study showed he was a little bit sick, but he didn't have bad seizures and didn't die.
[01:09:56.808 --> 01:10:00.369]  And so they actually used that, went to the FDA, and said, look, one of them lived, so it's okay.
[01:10:00.389 --> 01:10:01.950]  They only used that monkey out of the study.
[01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:08.152]  And then they had 13 other studies done, and even the FDA said, oh no, this stuff kills.
[01:10:08.633 --> 01:10:09.573]  This stuff is toxic.
[01:10:09.653 --> 01:10:17.957]  It's basically wood alcohol held inside of another molecule structure, and it breaks off into wood alcohol and another form of acid.
[01:10:18.937 --> 01:10:20.978]  That that form of acid itself eats holes in the brain.
[01:10:22.621 --> 01:10:23.141]  It's real simple.
[01:10:23.161 --> 01:10:24.622]  You drink white alcohol, you go blind, folks.
[01:10:24.942 --> 01:10:26.622]  But see, toxins aren't addictive.
[01:10:26.642 --> 01:10:36.385]  Almost universally so, if not taken in... You know, there are whole tribes of people in the South Pacific and Africa, all over, who are addicted to snake venom.
[01:10:36.725 --> 01:10:37.305]  Did you know that?
[01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:43.427]  Some of the Mayans and some of the Toltecs and Aztecs would actually take snake venom and enemas.
[01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:47.729]  I don't want to get off too much in that, but arsenic is a heavy metal.
[01:10:48.029 --> 01:10:48.729]  Very addictive.
[01:10:50.968 --> 01:10:52.888]  So why did Searle do this?
[01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:55.589]  Well, their own documents show they know it's addictive.
[01:10:56.009 --> 01:11:01.991]  So that's why your family member will smirk at you, even though they're going blind and having all these health problems, and they were in good shape.
[01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:05.872]  They'll smirk and slurp their diet coke, but now it's in 9,000 plus foods.
[01:11:05.892 --> 01:11:08.492]  And that was years ago I checked, and now I've heard it's in more.
[01:11:08.512 --> 01:11:11.213]  Because the patent ran out on it, so it's been widely distributed.
[01:11:11.993 --> 01:11:13.193]  And it's just deadly poison.
[01:11:14.274 --> 01:11:18.374]  And their own studies show that it kills primates.
[01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:20.215]  And
[01:11:21.172 --> 01:11:21.873]  I got family.
[01:11:22.274 --> 01:11:25.259]  I got family who've got multiple degrees and are smart as a whip.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.401]  Sharp as a tack.
[01:11:27.663 --> 01:11:29.787]  And they'll smirk at me and drink a Diet Coke.
[01:11:30.368 --> 01:11:32.451]  And they just aren't going to listen.
[01:11:32.672 --> 01:11:33.393]  And they don't care.
[01:11:33.533 --> 01:11:34.655]  And it's bad for them.
[01:11:35.586 --> 01:11:42.228]  And look, they're old mountain men who can drink a bottle of Jack Daniels every day and smoke three packs of cigarettes and they'll be alright.
[01:11:42.508 --> 01:11:45.869]  Some people can drink this stuff and be okay, but it'll kill most of us.
[01:11:46.249 --> 01:11:47.169]  And let me tell you something.
[01:11:47.509 --> 01:11:51.531]  Aspartame is a lot more dangerous from the studies I've seen than tobacco.
[01:11:52.131 --> 01:11:53.671]  And tobacco is real bad, folks.
[01:11:53.991 --> 01:11:57.852]  Especially when you smoke a whole lot of it or chew a whole lot of it.
[01:11:58.153 --> 01:11:58.933]  Believe me, I like it.
[01:11:59.233 --> 01:12:00.453]  And it's hard for me to stay away from it.
[01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:15.813]  Again, I've just spent five minutes on this, and I've got all this other news and your calls I want to cover, but what is it in the human condition that people just don't want to listen?
[01:12:16.074 --> 01:12:26.040]  Now, the good news is that people are, by and large, a large portion of them, are refusing to drink the aspartame soft drinks, but then it doesn't matter because it's in all the foods now.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.440]  Basically, all the foods have it.
[01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:29.982]  They'll disguise it under the term artificial sweetener.
[01:12:31.761 --> 01:12:34.923]  But they moved to Splenda, and now there's all these studies on Splenda.
[01:12:35.424 --> 01:12:38.185]  And the question is, there are artificial sweeteners that are not toxic.
[01:12:38.345 --> 01:12:40.127]  Why are they always pushing stuff that's toxic?
[01:12:40.607 --> 01:12:42.388]  Because it's addictive.
[01:12:43.069 --> 01:12:44.530]  There's money in drugs.
[01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:48.112]  You don't think Big Pharma, by the way, Searle is Big Pharma.
[01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:49.733]  Monsanto is Big Pharma.
[01:12:50.874 --> 01:12:52.095]  All of these companies are Big Pharma.
[01:12:52.115 --> 01:12:58.699]  The same ones pushing Ritalin and Prozac on you, and trying to get laws passed to make half the kids in school take them, New Freedom Initiative.
[01:13:01.634 --> 01:13:02.274]  Don't you understand?
[01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:06.996]  They're going to camouflage other things as sweeteners and they're really drugs.
[01:13:08.237 --> 01:13:10.938]  And they're the most old-fashioned drugs that get the job done.
[01:13:11.078 --> 01:13:11.798]  They're poison!
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:22.403]  I mean, you go read what the old shaman or the old witch doctor or the old witch would do, it doesn't matter what culture, is they'd go eat some poisonous plant and have hallucinations.
[01:13:23.103 --> 01:13:24.744]  I mean, that's what poison is.
[01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:26.304]  People poison themselves.
[01:13:26.585 --> 01:13:29.726]  Pharmakeia, pharmacies, is where you get that term.
[01:13:31.383 --> 01:13:35.807]  And, uh, it's just so destructive.
[01:13:36.848 --> 01:13:42.372]  And to know that it eats holes in your brain, to know, and it's so sick.
[01:13:43.273 --> 01:13:48.097]  We know sodium and tannous fluoride hurt small mammals, young mammals, worse than adult mammals.
[01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:54.422]  We know that aspartame, it's much worse for small children.
[01:13:54.442 --> 01:14:00.047]  And so when you go look at Pedialyte and all the stuff at the baby stores, it's all, ooh, aspartame for your child.
[01:14:00.839 --> 01:14:01.981]  And it's high levels of it.
[01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:07.650]  And you go, oh look, a fluoridated water for kids.
[01:14:08.331 --> 01:14:10.915]  I know they've got a big report out, oh your kids need more fluoride.
[01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:13.798]  And then fools go, well, fluoride is naturally occurring.
[01:14:13.818 --> 01:14:14.158]  You need it.
[01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:16.839]  You need calcium fluoride.
[01:14:17.139 --> 01:14:19.719]  Totally different from stannous fluoride.
[01:14:19.739 --> 01:14:28.661]  You know, the head dentist in Canada, who 15 years ago, we've interviewed him, got fluoride authorized because the Canadians didn't want to do it.
[01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:29.821]  They were a little bit more informed.
[01:14:30.321 --> 01:14:32.882]  And he did a national big crusade saying it was great.
[01:14:33.342 --> 01:14:40.123]  Well, he's now gone public, reversed himself, apologized, and said he didn't know they were using stannous fluoride
[01:14:40.883 --> 01:14:46.068]  From the toxic waste facilities of aluminum manufacturing plants.
[01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:56.456]  You see, at the end of World War II, so many planes, so many vehicles were made out of aluminum.
[01:14:57.037 --> 01:15:00.860]  They had hundreds of millions of tons, it was reported.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.201]  It was everywhere.
[01:15:03.486 --> 01:15:07.311]  A bunch of big rivers in Tennessee, remember, in the late 40s died.
[01:15:08.393 --> 01:15:14.581]  Humans were poisoned because some of the fluoride got spilt just a few big containers into rivers.
[01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:16.203]  I mean, it's that deadly.
[01:15:16.624 --> 01:15:17.865]  And there's no way to get rid of it.
[01:15:18.786 --> 01:15:19.367]  What did they do?
[01:15:19.387 --> 01:15:21.330]  They just said, we're going to put it in the water.
[01:15:23.234 --> 01:15:37.765]  And by the way, I've read the official, I mean, there are official Pulitzer Prize winning World War II books, books about World War II, that have the documents that the Nazis put it in their slave camp water, in the water of the population to make you docile.
[01:15:38.185 --> 01:15:48.552]  That particular chemical, that particular compound, element, fluoride, makes you docile, whereas arsenic has an amphetamine effect.
[01:15:48.572 --> 01:15:50.654]  See, they all have different effects in the body.
[01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:56.873]  And so they took it and they stuck it in the water and they knew and then this is admitted.
[01:15:56.893 --> 01:15:57.694]  You understand folks?
[01:15:57.914 --> 01:15:59.194]  This is not my opinion.
[01:15:59.814 --> 01:16:01.015]  You can go check out what I'm saying.
[01:16:01.035 --> 01:16:01.935]  You can take it to the bank.
[01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:02.496]  It's true.
[01:16:04.596 --> 01:16:05.957]  DU, same thing.
[01:16:06.057 --> 01:16:09.679]  They have thousands and thousands and thousands and more than that.
[01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:10.719]  It's just a massive amount.
[01:16:10.759 --> 01:16:12.860]  I forget the actual statistic of DU.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:32.179]  Because for any ounce of real, purified, particular isotope of uranium that they purify out for a bomb or a plant or a submarine, power plant, whatever it is, whatever the case may be, there were just giant facilities of this stuff!
[01:16:32.259 --> 01:16:32.980]  Well, what do you do?
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.503]  Well, it's great for making the tanks impregnable!
[01:16:36.261 --> 01:16:42.082]  Just normal, you know, you fire a steel rod to sabot at it, it just bounces off the Abrams M1A1.
[01:16:42.503 --> 01:16:50.084]  So you make the top turret out of it, you make the front out of it, the side out of it, you make some of the thinner areas out of it.
[01:16:50.444 --> 01:16:55.146]  And then, oh, let's put it in the Vulcan cannons of the A-10 Warthog.
[01:16:55.526 --> 01:16:56.846]  Oh, let's put it in the Bradley fighting vehicle.
[01:16:56.886 --> 01:17:00.107]  Oh, let's put it in the ammo of the M16s and the .50 cals.
[01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:00.867]  Oh, let's put it in the
[01:17:02.057 --> 01:17:17.047]  And then their own manuals say, the Army's manuals, and the National Atomic Energy Agency, and our own Federal Atomic Agency, all the document types, stacks of them, official, says it's deadly poisonous, not just radioactive, and that if you breathe any of it, you're going to die.
[01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:20.070]  And what do they do?
[01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:23.392]  Then they just tell the troops, just use it all over the world, use it in the U.S.
[01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:27.415]  at proving grounds, at the firing ranges, the testing ranges, and they just do it.
[01:17:27.455 --> 01:17:27.715]  You see,
[01:17:28.425 --> 01:17:31.767]  This goes to the very nature of the elite we're talking about.
[01:17:32.328 --> 01:17:37.151]  I've seen Dick Cheney on TV, on C-SPAN, while he's sitting there waiting to give a speech, he's drinking a Diet Coke.
[01:17:38.632 --> 01:17:44.235]  It was Rumsfeld who got Aspartame approved, when he was on the head of Monsanto, when they bought Searle.
[01:17:46.016 --> 01:17:47.697]  Or when they merged with Searle, to be precise.
[01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:57.884]  He's the guy who got the Terminator genes for the plants approved, now taking over entire species of plants and jumping across species, creating massive problems.
[01:17:58.453 --> 01:18:02.295]  He's the guy that gave the nuclear reactors to South Korea, the bio-weapons and chemical weapons to Saddam.
[01:18:02.335 --> 01:18:02.995]  It's always him.
[01:18:03.035 --> 01:18:05.296]  It's like he's Darth Sidious or something.
[01:18:05.356 --> 01:18:16.681]  I mean, I just... When you really start to look at him, it's like... Dick Cheney goes over there and he goes into bases and spends the night in Iraq, and bases, you can go look at it, that were bombarded by DU.
[01:18:16.781 --> 01:18:17.982]  Why is he breathing it?
[01:18:18.242 --> 01:18:21.143]  It's like they just love death themselves!
[01:18:23.024 --> 01:18:27.866]  You almost gotta commend them that they all do it themselves.
[01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:30.334]  It's been admitted that Bush Sr.
[01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:31.114]  is on Prozac.
[01:18:32.735 --> 01:18:33.795]  That stuff is so toxic.
[01:18:34.015 --> 01:18:35.056]  By the way, it's fluoride based.
[01:18:35.756 --> 01:18:36.997]  It's main molecule is fluoride.
[01:18:39.358 --> 01:18:41.519]  So, we'll come back, I promise.
[01:18:41.539 --> 01:18:43.580]  We'll talk to Ida, Don, Brian, Mike, Mike and others.
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.161]  I promise we'll go right to your calls and back.
[01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:48.783]  I'm just, I'm so blown away by this.
[01:18:48.863 --> 01:18:50.143]  It's just, what are they doing?
[01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:51.364]  What's wrong with these people?
[01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.564]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.185 --> 01:18:59.985]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.106 --> 01:19:08.988]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.228 --> 01:19:11.849]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:11.829 --> 01:19:13.250]  's patented methodology.

[01:22:03.897 --> 01:22:05.097]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:22:05.437 --> 01:22:06.858]  Now's the time to fight back.

[01:23:04.871 --> 01:23:06.352]  Halliburton Concentration Camps.
[01:23:06.772 --> 01:23:07.512]  It's all coming up.
[01:23:09.413 --> 01:23:09.774]  That's right.
[01:23:09.794 --> 01:23:11.414]  They're not just going to rip you off for your money.
[01:23:11.434 --> 01:23:12.775]  No, they're going to run your life.
[01:23:13.675 --> 01:23:15.696]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ida in Nebraska.
[01:23:15.796 --> 01:23:16.577]  Ida, thanks for holding.
[01:23:16.677 --> 01:23:16.997]  Welcome.
[01:23:17.357 --> 01:23:18.157]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:23.460]  I've got a copy of the Reader's Digest in front of me from April 1993.
[01:23:26.604 --> 01:23:27.547]  Thanks for watching!
[01:23:33.533 --> 01:23:39.275]  Surprisingly, that's not ever covered by our so-called media, but boy whoop-de-doo from the princely!
[01:23:39.655 --> 01:23:46.317]  Well, I mean, if you go to the Davos Switzerland Forum, or you go read the transcripts, it's all, thank you Prince Charles for the plan, thank you for the direction.
[01:23:46.697 --> 01:24:03.162]  You go read Smart Growth, any of it, they literally own half the planet, but they, the tabloids, in many cases owned by them, no kidding, the Queen's youngest son actually owns a large portion of them, they badmouth themselves and make themselves look like a joke on purpose.
[01:24:03.602 --> 01:24:04.843]  Yep, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:06.064 --> 01:24:18.633]  The other day I was watching the History Channel, and it was a show on Hitler, and he made the comment, it's a good thing for the government that people don't know how to think, and that's exactly what we've got in this country.
[01:24:19.234 --> 01:24:20.795]  They're taking pointers from Hitler.
[01:24:21.235 --> 01:24:31.723]  Also, I've always wondered, how come with Bush's state of the Union, why don't they call it the state of the plantation, the state of his kingdom, or the state of his serfdom?
[01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:35.767]  Well, I saw Kelly Hutchinson's Chief of Staff.
[01:24:37.123 --> 01:24:42.548]  Last night I took my wife and children to a restaurant, and he comes in and sits down and he goes, Hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:24:42.568 --> 01:24:43.509]  And I didn't know him.
[01:24:43.809 --> 01:24:45.270]  He goes, Yeah, yeah, we've seen the show.
[01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:45.811]  How's it going?
[01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:49.133]  And I said, Aren't you going to rush back and go see the Emperor's speech?
[01:24:49.854 --> 01:24:51.335]  And he and his wife started laughing.
[01:24:51.695 --> 01:24:56.219]  And I said, No, you know what John Yoo and others have been saying in the White House, that he has dictatorial power.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.021]  We know, Alex.
[01:24:58.441 --> 01:25:02.344]  But see, they're just friendly little people, and everything's fine.
[01:25:02.405 --> 01:25:05.187]  I mean, really, this is happening, folks.
[01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:11.829]  Well, Alex, the one thing I've got to say with the FEMA camps, I hope when they haul me off, they put me in the same camp with you.
[01:25:11.849 --> 01:25:13.029]  We're going to have a lot of fun.
[01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.970]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.551]  You bet.
[01:25:15.991 --> 01:25:16.371]  You know what?
[01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:17.251]  I'm going to be frank with you.
[01:25:17.271 --> 01:25:19.833]  I think if it gets to that point, they're probably going to beat me to death.
[01:25:20.473 --> 01:25:22.654]  That's usually how they do it.
[01:25:22.994 --> 01:25:23.654]  It'll be good for me.
[01:25:23.674 --> 01:25:26.056]  They'll probably get overly excited and kill me out of hand.
[01:25:27.036 --> 01:25:30.177]  And then I'll punch you out of all this.
[01:25:30.898 --> 01:25:31.718]  It really won't matter.
[01:25:31.758 --> 01:25:33.279]  I think if we go to that point,
[01:25:34.456 --> 01:25:36.358]  That's really the kind of stuff they do.
[01:25:37.259 --> 01:25:46.748]  If they're able to go full bore and really pull their whole nine yards, they'll be grabbing so many people they won't even have time.
[01:25:47.688 --> 01:25:51.451]  To create false charges or frame you.
[01:25:52.592 --> 01:25:56.175]  They'll just send by a squad and if you resist, they'll kill you.
[01:25:56.816 --> 01:26:03.822]  And then if they get you in custody, they'll hand you over to folks and send you to a camp where it's federal prison guards who have rap sheets.
[01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:04.582]  And that's admitted.
[01:26:04.863 --> 01:26:05.623]  Again, mainstream news.
[01:26:05.643 --> 01:26:12.089]  They hire for the different torture camps guys who like to rape and kill people and who've been fired from federal prisons.
[01:26:12.689 --> 01:26:15.692]  And then it's better to die than to fall into their hands.
[01:26:15.732 --> 01:26:17.874]  And they've got thousands of these Ted Bundy types.
[01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:22.578]  Look, smart Ted Bundys today don't go out, you know, killing randomly.
[01:26:22.598 --> 01:26:23.619]  They go join the government.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.022]  And it's a happy hunting ground of fun.
[01:26:28.755 --> 01:26:30.277]  And they get to enjoy themselves.
[01:26:30.737 --> 01:26:37.644]  And then again, one of the chief counsels of the White House, John Year, says they can torture children in front of their parents and crush their genitalia.
[01:26:38.204 --> 01:26:39.065]  That's mainstream news.
[01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:41.588]  So there's your Christian leaders for you.
[01:26:42.068 --> 01:26:45.892]  Let's go ahead, and many Christians, I would imagine, would be praising that.
[01:26:46.272 --> 01:26:47.874]  They love the torture of so-called Christians.
[01:26:48.908 --> 01:26:52.489]  Of course, they worship somebody that's got horns and a forked tail, but they think that's Jesus now.
[01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:54.110]  It's a great deception.
[01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:55.811]  Don and KC, you're on the air.
[01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:56.271]  Go ahead.
[01:26:56.591 --> 01:26:57.151]  Yes, Alex.
[01:26:57.191 --> 01:26:58.452]  You know, it's true.
[01:26:58.472 --> 01:27:01.653]  These people, these world elites, are very insane.
[01:27:01.793 --> 01:27:14.038]  They do love death, and I think we're living in a time where the Bible refers to as the time when the transgressors will come to the full, meaning that evil would be perfected to an art form or a science.
[01:27:14.784 --> 01:27:16.785]  It's what they're pursuing, and it's insane.
[01:27:17.246 --> 01:27:25.111]  Yeah, people say that, you know, corruption and evil is nothing new, it's always been there, and that's true, but now, it is being scientifically perfected.
[01:27:25.331 --> 01:27:25.832]  Exactly.
[01:27:26.412 --> 01:27:29.234]  And this is why it's so hard for the average person to see through it.
[01:27:29.274 --> 01:27:30.875]  First of all, their agenda is insane.
[01:27:31.616 --> 01:27:33.397]  And they're so evil, they can't even relate to it.
[01:27:33.617 --> 01:27:36.879]  I got a call from a friend of mine, a dear friend, who's down in Houston.
[01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:42.223]  He's at a conference, a Christian conference on, you know, getting the wealth of the wicked in the last days, type stuff.
[01:27:43.072 --> 01:27:54.537]  And I guess some speaker got up and told the story about how someone handed a book to Laura Bush that was so impressed her and affected her that she got the baptism of the Holy Spirit and gave it to her husband.
[01:27:55.177 --> 01:28:00.719]  This happened last October and yet a month later, he's in that meeting cursing the Constitution.
[01:28:00.739 --> 01:28:04.941]  And I'm looking at an article right now by Doug Thompson of Capitol Hill Blue.
[01:28:04.981 --> 01:28:09.203]  He wrote this over a year and a half ago, talking about the President's erratic behavior.
[01:28:09.983 --> 01:28:27.907]  And he said that he would go from quoting the Bible and talking about doing God's will to these expletives, tirades against the Democrats, the media, and telling his aides to F over anybody they consider to be an opponent.
[01:28:28.607 --> 01:28:31.728]  And this guy's like a modern-day Caligula, you know?
[01:28:32.388 --> 01:28:37.830]  I mean, George Bush goes to a meeting every year where they bus in gay porn stars.
[01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:39.410]  I mean, that's New York Post, so...
[01:28:40.334 --> 01:28:41.416]  I guess that's Christian.
[01:28:42.217 --> 01:28:42.798]  Okay, fine.
[01:28:44.059 --> 01:28:44.961]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.461 --> 01:28:47.064]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.985 --> 01:28:50.668]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.255 --> 01:28:56.196]  You need your cup of coffee each morning, right?
[01:28:56.496 --> 01:28:58.257]  But you're not sure if it's right for your health.
[01:28:58.597 --> 01:28:59.838]  Now there's Gano Coffee.
[01:29:00.158 --> 01:29:04.840]  Gano Coffee is the new low-acid, low-caffeine, naturally healthy coffee.
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:13.324]  What makes Gano Coffee special is the secret ingredient Ganoderma, a concentration of red reishi mushroom, also known as the miraculous king of herbs.

[01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:43.856]  That's 860-567-7744.
[01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:45.037]  We don't need no education.
[01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:11.019]  It's not my opinion that George W. Bush is part of a hereditary death cult.
[01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:15.900]  You all know about Skull and Bones, but we have the annals of Bohemian Grove.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.080]  I've been inside.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.501]  I've shot hidden video.
[01:32:18.541 --> 01:32:22.221]  We've now had an employee of the facility who contacted us who shot video inside.
[01:32:22.582 --> 01:32:28.343]  We have the sacrificial altars, the deity where they do the mock human sacrifice, the effigies of children they burn.
[01:32:30.198 --> 01:32:41.966]  And I saw on eBay yesterday another Bohemian Grove animal up for sale and they had photos there of all these owls and skulls and death and they had all these weird death chants in them.
[01:32:42.327 --> 01:32:47.130]  And I have Washington Times articles about all the gay prostitutes being shipped in.
[01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:48.551]  They don't really want women.
[01:32:48.611 --> 01:32:52.894]  It's the Christian conservative leaders predominantly that go there, our great Christian leaders,
[01:32:53.636 --> 01:33:03.958]  You know, when they're not out owning racehorses or gambling millions in a night, they are there frolicking with the finest male prostitutes money can buy.
[01:33:04.778 --> 01:33:07.459]  And there's no evidence of Bush being with these people.
[01:33:07.659 --> 01:33:12.619]  He just goes to a meeting where Richard Nixon, we have the audio clip of him in the Harper's interview.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.060]  For years Nixon was in the Harper's interview talking about how it's a big gay orgy.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.761]  He used a different, he said, GD homosexual orgy.
[01:33:23.235 --> 01:33:26.236]  We could air the clip, but there's mild profanity, so we're not going to.
[01:33:26.257 --> 01:33:28.217]  Well, I don't think it's that mild, but you know what I mean.
[01:33:29.018 --> 01:33:30.998]  It's not the F-word, but we're not going to air it.
[01:33:31.118 --> 01:33:35.100]  You can type Richard Nixon's Bohemian Grove clip into Google and you'll get it everywhere.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:44.864]  But now, Harper's a few years ago released the actual interview, the whole interview, and then we got that clip specifically out of the Harper's interview.
[01:33:46.761 --> 01:33:47.802]  That's what they do there.
[01:33:48.202 --> 01:33:55.665]  And then I have spy magazine articles, I have a whole bunch of other mainstream news articles admitting that they just bus them in.
[01:33:56.706 --> 01:33:58.446]  And I talked to the employee who worked there.
[01:33:58.686 --> 01:34:02.408]  He got hit on quite a bit, being a younger man by these guys.
[01:34:03.268 --> 01:34:13.173]  And again, they pose as Christian conservatives, but in reality, they are big government promoting, New World Order loving, and by and large, homosexuals.
[01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:25.457]  And, look, it isn't just Jeff Gannon, aka Guckard, aka whatever his real name is, you know, who's this big male madam running male whores in and out of the White House.
[01:34:25.477 --> 01:34:26.378]  It wasn't just him.
[01:34:26.438 --> 01:34:30.940]  If you read even into the mainstream reports, you can see about other male prostitutes going in.
[01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:34.022]  He also, again, was in porno movies.
[01:34:35.043 --> 01:34:43.108]  And there is video and photos, and I put it in my film, The Order of Death, of Bush comes over, whispers in his ear, and rubs the back of his neck.
[01:34:43.795 --> 01:34:48.900]  And let me tell you something, when I see my uncle or a cousin who's a male, I'll hug them.
[01:34:49.801 --> 01:34:55.286]  But I don't rub their neck and put my cheek up against their neck.
[01:34:55.306 --> 01:34:58.389]  I mean, frankly, what Bush did is what I do to my wife.
[01:34:59.275 --> 01:35:05.057]  When nobody's around and, you know, I come home, hey baby, I'll kiss her and run my hand up along her neck.
[01:35:05.437 --> 01:35:06.037]  That's what you do.
[01:35:06.057 --> 01:35:07.477]  I mean, it's clearly sexual.
[01:35:07.877 --> 01:35:12.559]  Bush is, oh yeah, ooh, baby, ooh, the Christian-ness.
[01:35:13.219 --> 01:35:15.339]  And people just ignore all this.
[01:35:15.659 --> 01:35:22.121]  And then Gannon, the male whore, is in there over a hundred times, half the time after midnight.
[01:35:22.481 --> 01:35:26.502]  He shows up at 10, leaves at 1 a.m., prancing out the front gates.
[01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:28.663]  Whole squads of them.
[01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:32.863]  And just the male prostitutes packing in the middle of the night?
[01:35:33.623 --> 01:35:34.484]  No big deal.
[01:35:34.504 --> 01:35:39.627]  I mean, if your preacher had known male prostitutes prancing out at 1am, would you think anything?
[01:35:39.947 --> 01:35:41.768]  You'd go, no, it's of the Lord.
[01:35:42.889 --> 01:35:46.290]  And my point here is they claim they're Christian conservatives.
[01:35:47.991 --> 01:35:49.052]  It's just amazing.
[01:35:51.476 --> 01:36:00.658]  And all these so-called Christians freak out over Bill Clinton and Lewinsky and all, and that is gross with the cigar, and I don't want to get into it, but I mean, it is bad.
[01:36:01.239 --> 01:36:10.861]  But why are they freaking out about that when they're not freaking out about stuff ten times more deviant?
[01:36:12.794 --> 01:36:23.138]  I mean, male prostitutes, folks, and somebody's... I mean, I've got that old compilation of mainstream TV reports where they even make the jokes and comment, ooh, having some fun in there.
[01:36:24.698 --> 01:36:26.659]  And see, that's what they use to hold over Bush.
[01:36:26.679 --> 01:36:33.081]  You'll do exactly what we say, or we're going to expose what you and Roe and others are reportedly doing in there.
[01:36:33.261 --> 01:36:35.002]  But all of that aside,
[01:36:35.743 --> 01:36:37.404]  He's praying at a Shinto shrine.
[01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:38.505]  He's praying at a mosque.
[01:36:38.545 --> 01:36:39.886]  He's praying at a Catholic church.
[01:36:39.906 --> 01:36:41.487]  He's praying at a Protestant church.
[01:36:41.527 --> 01:36:42.508]  He's a chameleon.
[01:36:42.868 --> 01:36:46.911]  But what does Bush do when the lights are low and he's on vacation?
[01:36:47.211 --> 01:36:50.373]  He puts on a black robe and engages in a mock human sacrifice.
[01:36:50.634 --> 01:36:52.235]  And I'm sorry if that sounds crazy.
[01:36:52.555 --> 01:36:53.195]  It's true!
[01:36:54.636 --> 01:36:56.178]  My new film is called The Order of Death.
[01:36:56.238 --> 01:36:57.619]  It's one of my best documentaries.
[01:36:57.719 --> 01:36:58.619]  Very professional.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:05.224]  And on the same DVD you get the re-edited, remastered, updated 2000 Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:07.142 --> 01:37:12.523]  We updated it about, what, three or four months ago and released it in December of last year.
[01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:13.923]  So it's just a few months old.
[01:37:14.363 --> 01:37:24.626]  So you get the new updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, our original infiltration, updated with the new film, with the new footage inside and all the stuff about the homosexual prostitutes and all of it.
[01:37:25.646 --> 01:37:26.626]  Show it to your church!
[01:37:28.146 --> 01:37:30.087]  And ask them, I mean, is this of the Lord?
[01:37:30.307 --> 01:37:31.067]  Is this good?
[01:37:31.747 --> 01:37:33.647]  You will see photos of Bush and Bush Sr.
[01:37:33.667 --> 01:37:34.668]  standing in front of the owl.
[01:37:35.068 --> 01:37:36.188]  You will see all of it.
[01:37:37.141 --> 01:37:38.002]  And this is admitted!
[01:37:38.963 --> 01:37:47.653]  And, of course, we're now carrying Dylan Avery's great documentary, the Loose Change video about government involvement in 9-11.
[01:37:47.673 --> 01:37:48.774]  A lot better than Loose Change 1.
[01:37:49.014 --> 01:37:49.935]  It's excellent.
[01:37:49.955 --> 01:37:50.756]  That's why we're carrying it.
[01:37:51.176 --> 01:37:54.280]  And, by the way, all my films are available at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.361]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:57.203]  There are monthly subscriptions there.
[01:37:58.406 --> 01:38:00.447]  And you can also go and get a yearly subscription.
[01:38:00.467 --> 01:38:02.949]  When you get a yearly subscription, you get three months for free.
[01:38:03.089 --> 01:38:04.009]  Fifteen cents a day, folks.
[01:38:04.329 --> 01:38:07.811]  A cup of coffee costs a dollar at the gas station, two bucks at Starbucks.
[01:38:08.512 --> 01:38:12.814]  I mean, you get a whole week plus for the price of a cup of coffee.
[01:38:13.334 --> 01:38:16.156]  You get a whole month for the cost of maybe three cups of coffee.
[01:38:16.476 --> 01:38:18.057]  You get a whole year for what?
[01:38:18.077 --> 01:38:20.078]  The cost of... What is it?
[01:38:20.138 --> 01:38:21.939]  Something like 15, 20 cups of coffee?
[01:38:23.271 --> 01:38:29.640]  Yes, and you can download burn copies of the videos, my best audio interviews from the radio show, my best of Austin TV show.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:31.263]  I mean, it's won Best of Austin in the Reader's Bowl.
[01:38:31.283 --> 01:38:32.584]  It's a pretty good TV show.
[01:38:32.604 --> 01:38:34.247]  Been on the air for now almost 12 years.
[01:38:34.687 --> 01:38:36.931]  And then there's also my weekly TV reports.
[01:38:36.951 --> 01:38:39.214]  I'm now doing in-studio at least one interview a week.
[01:38:40.064 --> 01:38:45.827]  About to go up today is going to be the Tex Mars interview, because it takes time to edit it together and add documents and stuff.
[01:38:45.847 --> 01:38:48.469]  We could just throw the raw stuff up there, but we make it even better for you.
[01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:52.151]  And the David Stoll National Toll Road Control Grid interview.
[01:38:52.191 --> 01:38:54.212]  That's going to be going up to PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:38:54.472 --> 01:39:00.135]  And we've got Celica Stillo, top DEA agent in Latin America, watch government drug dealing and murders going on.
[01:39:00.775 --> 01:39:02.916]  And he'll be joining us Friday for two hours.
[01:39:02.956 --> 01:39:04.377]  That'll be edited down to about an hour.
[01:39:04.657 --> 01:39:06.318]  That'll be up for you as well as members.
[01:39:06.378 --> 01:39:08.739]  So, so much at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.882]  It just gets better and better and loose change is there right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.800]  Along with so much more.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:26.923]  But get hard copies of all my films, or other films and books we carry, at the video and book store at InfoWars.com or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:39:27.183 --> 01:39:29.123]  But people, really the theme's been the last week.
[01:39:29.523 --> 01:39:32.284]  Tons of calls about God and the Devil and the New World Order.
[01:39:32.544 --> 01:39:33.644]  More than we normally get.
[01:39:34.384 --> 01:39:37.345]  And even if you don't believe in God, the elite does.
[01:39:37.385 --> 01:39:38.745]  I mean, they really are into the occult.
[01:39:39.305 --> 01:39:45.827]  Every decision Reagan made was according to his astrologer, down to what minute he gave a speech to what color tie he wore.
[01:39:47.305 --> 01:39:48.966]  I mean, Nancy Reagan's talked about that.
[01:39:49.006 --> 01:39:50.046]  That's out of her own mouth.
[01:39:50.726 --> 01:39:51.787]  To me, that's crazy.
[01:39:52.747 --> 01:39:53.867]  I don't believe in astrology.
[01:39:53.907 --> 01:39:54.948]  I believe it's total kookdom.
[01:39:54.968 --> 01:39:56.608]  If that offends you, I'm sorry.
[01:39:56.648 --> 01:40:02.930]  I just don't believe in a science that says that the world is the center of the universe and that the sun orbits us.
[01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:04.611]  It's not a science.
[01:40:04.691 --> 01:40:05.431]  It's mindlessness.
[01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:09.903]  But that ought to concern you.
[01:40:09.923 --> 01:40:15.585]  Well, the stuff Nancy Reagan was into is nothing compared to what the Bushes and others are.
[01:40:15.985 --> 01:40:18.146]  And I don't know why so many Christians are in denial.
[01:40:18.766 --> 01:40:23.787]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Pennsylvania, then Mike, and Mike, and Chris, and others.
[01:40:23.827 --> 01:40:24.528]  Go ahead, Brian.
[01:40:25.648 --> 01:40:26.028]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:26.088 --> 01:40:26.508]  How are you doing?
[01:40:26.648 --> 01:40:26.868]  Good.
[01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:29.729]  Two things I want to bring to your attention.
[01:40:29.749 --> 01:40:33.671]  You know, in the 33rd chapter, when he was called by God to, you know,
[01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:46.672]  He was called to dig, and he dug, and he dug, and he dug, and he... God told him to open up, and he looked inside, and he saw the abominable, deathful things that the rulers thought that people would never find out.
[01:40:46.712 --> 01:40:50.695]  Yeah, what he did was he went to the temple, and he dug a hole through the wall to see what they were doing inside.
[01:40:50.715 --> 01:40:51.676]  What they were doing, right.
[01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:55.359]  And that's the same thing that you're doing, and that all of us are called to do.
[01:40:55.899 --> 01:41:04.826]  And the second thing is, it really blew my mind, when you had your George Miller interview, um, back, you know, when you exposed the Bohemian Grove back in March, um,
[01:41:05.882 --> 01:41:15.326]  I think it was March 12th or whatever, when they had the Dark Secrets Inside of a Human Girl, when you exposed that on George Newell, remember back in March of 2004?
[01:41:16.787 --> 01:41:18.268]  Yeah, that was on 3.3.
[01:41:18.728 --> 01:41:26.051]  Yeah, I taped your program that whole night, and it was funny how you said they needed control of the mind, the weather, and the religion.
[01:41:26.552 --> 01:41:28.793]  And that was like a time when I was just starting to wake up to it.
[01:41:28.813 --> 01:41:34.035]  It was kind of really deep and over my head, but as more of the evidence has come out, that's the truth.
[01:41:34.574 --> 01:41:35.895]  And that's the hardest thing of people.
[01:41:36.216 --> 01:41:40.300]  When you come up to the average person, they won't control the mind, the weather, the religion.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.624]  That's because whether you believe it or not, they believe it.
[01:41:44.585 --> 01:41:47.348]  Well, they're total control freaks.
[01:41:47.368 --> 01:41:47.748]  Well, it is.
[01:41:47.788 --> 01:41:49.470]  They're total and complete control freaks.
[01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:50.551]  Good to hear from you, Brian.
[01:41:50.852 --> 01:41:51.973]  Who's up next here in order?
[01:41:55.991 --> 01:41:58.915]  Okay, Mike in Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:41:58.935 --> 01:42:00.777]  Hey Alex, nice to hear from you.
[01:42:00.857 --> 01:42:01.899]  You've got a great show.
[01:42:02.019 --> 01:42:04.382]  I just have two things I want to see if I can get your opinion.
[01:42:05.883 --> 01:42:14.254]  One thing, looking at acquiring, buying a gun, and you know, I'm not too thrilled about the requirement licensing and all that sort of thing.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.402]  Is there any suggestions that you would give me as far as getting one?
[01:42:18.822 --> 01:42:23.325]  Yeah, you don't have the so-called gun show loophole law, I believe, in Louisiana.
[01:42:23.605 --> 01:42:25.126]  Just go to a gun show and buy a gun there.
[01:42:25.146 --> 01:42:25.847]  It won't be on record.
[01:42:26.327 --> 01:42:26.947]  Okay, cool.
[01:42:27.067 --> 01:42:28.869]  There'll be private sellers there.
[01:42:29.269 --> 01:42:29.849]  Okay, great.
[01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.690]  Great.
[01:42:31.110 --> 01:42:42.397]  And the next question is, I've heard a lot about Iran and the upcoming decision for them, I think, to sell their oil but to denominate it in euros rather than dollars.
[01:42:44.493 --> 01:42:47.794]  That follows a move by Europe and by China and many others.
[01:42:48.175 --> 01:42:48.695]  Okay, great.
[01:42:48.735 --> 01:42:54.858]  And what that does, I guess, and that's why our leaders are angry, is that it takes the control away from us, I guess.
[01:42:55.218 --> 01:42:56.319]  Could you elaborate a little bit on that?
[01:42:56.339 --> 01:42:59.900]  I just want to kind of understand a little bit more of the ramifications of that, and I'll just hang up and listen.
[01:43:00.101 --> 01:43:04.663]  Okay, let me try to... I mean, again, with economics, it's all very complex.
[01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:10.013]  It's very simple at one level, but then when you... It's simple what they're doing, what their goal is.
[01:43:10.073 --> 01:43:12.174]  Criminal consolidation, it's not free market.
[01:43:12.414 --> 01:43:18.998]  They'll use fascism, they'll use communism, they'll use socialism, they'll use privatization, anything to unfairly consolidate wealth.
[01:43:20.099 --> 01:43:24.661]  But, actually, the globalists running America want the dollar to be weak.
[01:43:24.761 --> 01:43:30.445]  Bush has actually done things to make the dollar weak, and going back four years ago, he's been saying he wants the weak dollar.
[01:43:30.965 --> 01:43:33.086]  And then claiming it'll help domestic manufacturing.
[01:43:33.126 --> 01:43:34.027]  Well, it hasn't helped.
[01:43:34.944 --> 01:43:37.565]  But it doesn't matter, he said in his speech it has, so it must be true.
[01:43:39.765 --> 01:43:42.406]  So, Bush is a puppet.
[01:43:42.426 --> 01:43:50.848]  The Republicans and Democrats are bought and paid for by the same financial elite that owns Europe and that predominantly owns most of the central banks of the world.
[01:43:50.888 --> 01:43:54.189]  The elite of the world don't just make money, they actually physically print it.
[01:43:55.009 --> 01:43:56.850]  And so what they're after is real assets.
[01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:58.331]  They control the fiat currency.
[01:43:58.371 --> 01:44:00.893]  That's just a vehicle of domination.
[01:44:00.913 --> 01:44:15.362]  I mean, imagine if you literally owned the money machines, you gave your private company the name Federal Reserve, and the people accepted it, and then you just set about creating an economic climate where people went bankrupt, but did it in an orderly fashion, so you could consolidate and basically own everything.
[01:44:16.263 --> 01:44:17.864]  I mean, that's how the Monopoly game works.
[01:44:19.005 --> 01:44:23.608]  And so, what I don't think Webster Tarpley gets, and a few people get, is that
[01:44:24.230 --> 01:44:49.567]  Is that it really is a monopolar, we already have a global government, they just have to play off different blocks of the world government against itself to give the people the illusion of some type of internal struggle so that the people don't wake up to the fact that there is an all-powerful that is socio-economically elite that is seeking to consolidate their foothold against the general population itself.
[01:44:50.863 --> 01:44:53.485]  And so I think we're going to see a slow slide of the dollar.
[01:44:53.986 --> 01:44:56.988]  Then I predicted many years ago that we'll then see the Euro go down.
[01:44:57.349 --> 01:45:01.112]  And they'll claim that there's too much fluctuation in global currencies.
[01:45:01.492 --> 01:45:10.480]  And so we're all going to go to one global currency to stop all of the speculation and gyrations that that causes.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.984]  They did that at a local level in the U.S., claiming that, you know, they'd give us a Federal Reserve and it would end all recessions.
[01:45:16.004 --> 01:45:17.926]  Then we had a big depression, which they engineered.
[01:45:19.267 --> 01:45:33.036]  So, that's really their plan, but in the short term, a weakening dollar, and that's mainly to debase our middle class, which is any independent group is always a threat to an elite.
[01:45:33.416 --> 01:45:37.278]  I've got to get into Halliburton and the concentration camps, but let's go to Mike in North Carolina.
[01:45:37.318 --> 01:45:37.979]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:45:38.019 --> 01:45:38.319]  Welcome.
[01:45:38.559 --> 01:45:38.919]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.261]  I had a few little quick questions I wanted to ask.
[01:45:42.341 --> 01:45:46.424]  I'm a shortwave listener, and I've had some problems hearing your rebroadcast at night.
[01:45:47.136 --> 01:45:49.998]  I was wondering if maybe you had changed the shortwave frequencies?
[01:45:50.699 --> 01:45:55.902]  You know, off the top of my head, I guess you don't have a computer?
[01:45:56.343 --> 01:45:57.443]  No, I'm not on a computer right now.
[01:45:57.744 --> 01:45:59.405]  Well, I mean, do you have a computer?
[01:45:59.565 --> 01:46:00.766]  Yeah, but I'm on dial-ups.
[01:46:00.846 --> 01:46:02.167]  I can't really listen to it at night.
[01:46:02.847 --> 01:46:04.849]  Sure, that's not... I was just asking if you had a computer.
[01:46:05.509 --> 01:46:10.132]  There on the listen page, I believe they have all the current shortwave frequencies there for you.
[01:46:10.633 --> 01:46:14.375]  It's one frequency in the first hour, and then 3210 in the second and third hour.
[01:46:16.094 --> 01:46:19.016]  And so I don't really remember the frequency in the first hour.
[01:46:19.036 --> 01:46:23.540]  I think it's like... 5.475 or something?
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:25.982]  I believe it's 5.765.
[01:46:26.402 --> 01:46:27.763]  Okay, 7.765.
[01:46:28.103 --> 01:46:28.404]  Alright.
[01:46:29.084 --> 01:46:32.427]  My second question... Well, I called you about two and a half years ago.
[01:46:32.487 --> 01:46:33.107]  I'm a teacher.
[01:46:33.988 --> 01:46:39.212]  What I do is I show my students your movies as an extra credit and stuff like that to kind of get them thinking outside the box.
[01:46:39.772 --> 01:46:44.456]  And this semester I have a really successful segment in my class called News That Makes Mike Mad.
[01:46:45.151 --> 01:47:01.165]  And it's a really kind of non-partisan effort where I pull up, you know, documents from your website and PrisonPlanet.com, WhatReallyHappened.com, just to try to get my students thinking outside the box because a lot of them are very conditioned into, you know, the standard paradigm.
[01:47:01.965 --> 01:47:07.910]  A really successful unit that we did, we had about a three-day discussion on Bohemian Grove that went really well.
[01:47:08.150 --> 01:47:13.455]  And whenever I bring up the Grove, like, their ears perk up because it's that kind of, you know, just
[01:47:13.916 --> 01:47:14.256]  I don't think so.
[01:47:33.254 --> 01:47:34.695]  I thought that was really cool, too.
[01:47:34.715 --> 01:47:42.844]  Well, Morals and Dogma, that sells for a couple hundred dollars a lot of times on Amazon and eBay.
[01:47:43.484 --> 01:47:46.247]  And yes, you can go to estate sales and stuff and buy that.
[01:47:46.727 --> 01:47:53.234]  And you can read Albert Pike, the Supreme Grand Mason, saying that he's possessed by Lucifer and that Lucifer is their god.
[01:47:53.694 --> 01:47:57.118]  But you tell the average Mason that, he doesn't know because he's a low-level Mason.
[01:47:57.682 --> 01:48:01.685]  Yeah, yeah, so I just thought that was really cool and that was kind of what prompted me to give you a call today.
[01:48:01.745 --> 01:48:08.070]  It's been a while since I've called your show, but I thought that... Well, you made a pretty good little acquisition there, because I bet you'd get about a hundred bucks for that book.
[01:48:08.511 --> 01:48:13.034]  Yeah, it's a little damaged, but they didn't even actually bother putting it in their collection.
[01:48:13.074 --> 01:48:15.596]  I guess it was just, you know, something from the state sale, they said.
[01:48:16.137 --> 01:48:20.580]  And they sell the books for fifty cents, but all I had was a dime on me, so they said, ah, just take it.
[01:48:21.861 --> 01:48:25.104]  And yeah, that's like probably, that was just a great find that
[01:48:25.683 --> 01:48:33.888]  I just felt like calling and sharing, and maybe if you had a little bit of time in this segment, you could just tell the readers a little more about the Freemasons for new listeners.
[01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:36.270]  Sure, I'll try to do that, and thanks for what you're doing with your class.
[01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:37.611]  They're blessed to have a teacher like you.
[01:48:37.631 --> 01:48:38.471]  They're really lucky.
[01:48:40.272 --> 01:48:44.435]  Look, I have a lot of old family members, most of them deceased now, who were Masons.
[01:48:44.455 --> 01:48:45.376]  They're not evil people.
[01:48:45.816 --> 01:48:49.218]  They were low-level Masons, and it's just a fraternal order at that level.
[01:48:51.668 --> 01:48:57.190]  Into the higher orders, 33 degree and above, and most Masons don't even know there's a degree above 33, which I think is honorary.
[01:48:58.150 --> 01:48:59.511]  It is openly satanic.
[01:49:00.711 --> 01:49:07.394]  And, uh... I mean, I knew about this when I was a kid, because my dad told me about it, because, you know, he had great-uncles and people that were high-level Masons.
[01:49:08.334 --> 01:49:13.396]  And it is, uh... It is... It is a Babylon Mission Religion cult.
[01:49:13.436 --> 01:49:15.176]  That's what Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove are.
[01:49:15.557 --> 01:49:16.737]  They are chapters of it.
[01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:20.450]  And really, that's all secret societies are.
[01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:23.231]  That was the old term for intelligence agencies.
[01:49:24.052 --> 01:49:30.654]  But because they go back so far in time, they have religious overtones, and they predate Christianity, so they are pagan.
[01:49:32.555 --> 01:49:34.856]  They would look at it as, no, we're not Luciferian, we're pagan.
[01:49:34.916 --> 01:49:37.297]  But their leaders actually worship Lucifer.
[01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:40.899]  They just think Lucifer's good, and that Jesus is really bad.
[01:49:41.599 --> 01:49:44.160]  It's some weird stuff, let me tell you.
[01:49:44.813 --> 01:49:45.694]  And that's what they believe.
[01:49:45.734 --> 01:49:47.714]  That's what our leaders predominantly believe.
[01:49:48.155 --> 01:49:49.315]  They are Satanists.
[01:49:49.896 --> 01:49:53.357]  But they believe Satan is good.
[01:49:54.978 --> 01:49:57.819]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.079 --> 01:49:59.660]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:50:05.023 --> 01:50:11.746]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.066 --> 01:50:14.048]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.248 --> 01:50:17.090]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:21.854]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.054 --> 01:50:26.457]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.697 --> 01:50:33.923]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:10.442 --> 01:52:11.102]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.975 --> 01:52:43.057]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.217 --> 01:52:49.160]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.884 --> 01:52:57.385]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.845 --> 01:52:59.386]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:02.648]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.048 --> 01:53:05.749]  I fell into a burglary of fire.
[01:53:05.789 --> 01:53:08.531]  Government has absolutely no accountability
[01:53:09.404 --> 01:53:12.206]  For their actions like drunks running free in the streets.
[01:53:12.687 --> 01:53:13.848]  Free speech in America.
[01:53:14.448 --> 01:53:19.572]  I bet Cindy Shan woke a few people up yesterday with her being arrested.
[01:53:19.672 --> 01:53:21.553]  More freedom fighters on the way.
[01:53:21.573 --> 01:53:24.696]  That's an instant message I got on my Yahoo instant messenger.
[01:53:24.736 --> 01:53:30.841]  And yes folks, I'm reading your instant messages as they pour in and try to read quite a few of them a day now here on the broadcast.
[01:53:30.861 --> 01:53:35.364]  You know, I've got a guest coming up and I'm just pushing them back 20-30 minutes in the next hour.
[01:53:35.384 --> 01:53:37.866]  I already canceled two guests today because I have so much news I want to
[01:53:38.524 --> 01:53:39.165]  I want to cover.
[01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:55.798]  Again, I try to detail everything and end up just hyperventilating on air because there's so much information going on, but let me right now get into this and then we'll get back into more news in the next hour and take your call and talk more about what happened to Cindy Sheehan, just another indicator of the police state.
[01:53:56.879 --> 01:54:03.004]  Halliburton detention camps for political subversives.
[01:54:03.044 --> 01:54:07.388]  And this is an article by Paul Joseph Watson, but every claim we make
[01:54:08.203 --> 01:54:10.788]  In the article, it has a hyperlink to a mainstream news article.
[01:54:10.828 --> 01:54:18.361]  It was announced in the Houston Chronicle, the Associated Press, and a bunch of other places yesterday that Halliburton is going to run the new emergency camps!
[01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:20.023]  The camps are needed!
[01:54:21.019 --> 01:54:47.968]  In another shining example of modern-day corporate fascism, it was announced recently that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root, and that's the same subsidiary involved in the kidnapping, Chicago Tribune, kidnapping, mass kidnapping, slave camps, had been awarded a $385 million contract by Homeland Security to construct detention and processing facilities in the event of a national emergency.
[01:54:48.628 --> 01:55:03.201]  The language of the preamble to the agreement veils the program with talk of temporary migrant holding centers, but it is made clear that the camps will also be used as the development of a plan to react to a national emergency.
[01:55:04.802 --> 01:55:14.250]  And again, they're going to legalize all illegal aliens, but then if the illegal aliens don't come in and get their new certification cards, then they will be put in these holding facilities and shipped out, but that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:15.932]  You read deeper, it is for the general public.
[01:55:17.501 --> 01:55:22.542]  Discussions of Federal Concentration Camps is no longer the rhetoric of paranoid Internet conspiracy theorists.
[01:55:22.562 --> 01:55:23.602]  It is mainstream news.
[01:55:24.043 --> 01:55:27.243]  Under the enemy combatant designation, anyone at the behest of the U.S.
[01:55:27.303 --> 01:55:28.804]  government, even if they are a U.S.
[01:55:28.844 --> 01:55:31.724]  citizen, can be kidnapped and placed in an internment facility.
[01:55:32.204 --> 01:55:34.005]  Again, another link to a mainstream news article.
[01:55:34.045 --> 01:55:35.565]  Everything we claim is documented.
[01:55:36.065 --> 01:55:37.926]  Forever without trial, by the way.
[01:55:37.986 --> 01:55:43.347]  Jose Padilla, an American citizen, has been spent over four years in a Navy brig and is just now getting to trial.
[01:55:44.564 --> 01:55:50.847]  In 2002, FEMA sought bids for major real estate and engineering firms to construct giant internment facilities.
[01:55:50.887 --> 01:55:58.211]  That's the headline in the case of a chemical, biological, or nuclear attack or natural disaster.
[01:55:58.231 --> 01:56:04.013]  It continues, Alex Jones has attended numerous military urban warfare training drills across the U.S.
[01:56:04.554 --> 01:56:10.336]  where role players were used to simulate arresting American citizens and taking them to internment camps.
[01:56:11.037 --> 01:56:13.818]  The move towards the database state in the U.S.
[01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:31.691]  In the UK, where every offense is arrestable and DNA records of every suspect are taken, even if later proven innocent, are permanently kept on record, there's only one tool necessary to create a master list of subversives that will be subject to internment in a manufactured time of national emergency.
[01:56:32.271 --> 01:56:47.425]  The National ID Card System is also intended to be used for this purpose, just as the Nazis used the IBM computer punch technology, that's what the tattoo was for, to catalog the list of homosexuals, gypsies, Jews, before the roundups began.
[01:56:47.945 --> 01:56:54.752]  Section 4-4 of the Terrorism Act in Britain enables police to obtain name and addresses and details of anyone they choose.
[01:56:54.992 --> 01:56:57.614]  That happened to me for asking questions on people on the street.
[01:56:57.935 --> 01:57:01.958]  Whether they are acting suspiciously or not, those details remain in the database forever.
[01:57:02.539 --> 01:57:10.967]  To date, 119,000 names of political activists have been taken, and this is a figure that will skyrocket once the Post 7-7 figures are taken into account.
[01:57:12.216 --> 01:57:15.998]  At the height of the Iraq War, protesters, around a million, marched across the country.
[01:57:16.038 --> 01:57:26.863]  However, most of these people were taking part in political protest for the first time, and again, it's all a big chilling effect, and it gets into the private Bechtel running the camps in New York for the RNC.
[01:57:28.603 --> 01:57:31.185]  We'll cover more when we start the third hour and take your call.
[01:57:31.205 --> 01:57:31.785]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.566 --> 01:57:38.448]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.012 --> 01:57:50.652]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.312 --> 01:57:52.393]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.093 --> 01:57:54.193]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.853 --> 01:57:55.653]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.433 --> 01:57:57.374]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.974 --> 01:58:01.875]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:06.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:19.931 --> 01:58:23.733]  Chuck and Bertrand and Evelyn, your calls are coming up here.
[01:58:24.714 --> 01:58:42.624]  After this quick break, that's in about five minutes, last hour I was getting into a whole bunch of mainstream news articles about how Kellogg Brown and Root, the subsidiary of Halliburton, that was in the Chicago Tribune in the kidnapping range, involved, and they actually just go around the whole villages and use them as slaves or sell them.
[01:58:43.636 --> 01:58:44.696]  Sex slavery, all of it.
[01:58:45.757 --> 01:58:50.598]  Mainstream news, they are going to run domestic FEMA camps for quote, during national emergencies.
[01:58:51.738 --> 01:59:01.561]  They've got all the police dressed up in these Darth Vader outfits to intimidate us, and they're trying to turn the police into these attack dogs, telling them it's macho, but a lot of cops, thank God, aren't buying into it.
[01:59:02.281 --> 01:59:04.902]  And I want to get into how this is so fascistic.
[01:59:05.582 --> 01:59:07.242]  You know, how controlling this is.
[01:59:08.263 --> 01:59:13.244]  We'll do that after the break, and how they arrested Sidney Sheehan last night, just another indicator of this police state.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:18.863]  And I want to play some more clips of Bush's speech and just how it's all complete fraud.
[01:59:19.783 --> 01:59:27.188]  And we have also a guest coming up about how they're trying to pass laws at the state and federal level where if you don't vaccinate you could ever get sick and they charge you as a criminal.
[01:59:27.748 --> 01:59:33.371]  But then they give vaccine liability protection to the companies.
[01:59:34.312 --> 01:59:35.432]  It's very frightening.
[01:59:35.973 --> 01:59:37.133]  Let's just go to calls right now.
[01:59:37.233 --> 01:59:38.334]  Chuck in California.
[01:59:38.374 --> 01:59:39.015]  You're on the air.
[01:59:39.055 --> 01:59:39.415]  Welcome.
[01:59:40.035 --> 01:59:40.836]  Oh, hello Alex.
[01:59:40.916 --> 01:59:43.077]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for many weeks here.
[01:59:44.306 --> 01:59:47.287]  I have kind of like probably an off-the-wall question.
[01:59:47.807 --> 01:59:57.309]  Okay, a friend of mine's in the Navy, okay, and he's telling me all our ships are painted with lead-based paint, and yet it's been outlawed in America.
[01:59:57.349 --> 02:00:07.931]  And my question was, does lead-based paint provide a resistance against some radiation fallout that they don't want us to have that protection?
[02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:12.632]  Well, lead-based paint, number one, I don't know if the Navy still uses lead-based paint.
[02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:16.194]  Number two, it just lasts a lot longer.
[02:00:16.514 --> 02:00:23.318]  It's a metal, so it lasts, what do they say, like three times longer than a lot of these paints they use today.
[02:00:24.338 --> 02:00:32.002]  And I have also heard that sensors have a little bit more trouble going through heavy lead-based paint.
[02:00:32.987 --> 02:00:33.447]  I don't know.
[02:00:33.868 --> 02:00:36.209]  So I'm ignorant of that, so I really can't answer your question.
[02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:43.353]  Okay, but if you would maybe check into it sometime and get back to us on air later, I would definitely appreciate it, and thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:43.573 --> 02:00:43.914]  You bet.
[02:00:43.934 --> 02:00:45.234]  I appreciate your call, Chuck.
[02:00:45.294 --> 02:00:46.695]  You sound like a smart guy to me.
[02:00:46.755 --> 02:00:48.316]  I bet you can find out for me.
[02:00:48.977 --> 02:00:49.877]  No, I'm serious.
[02:00:49.937 --> 02:00:50.517]  I don't know how.
[02:00:50.537 --> 02:01:00.583]  No, I'm going to try because, you know, I'm into Oshkod work with hospitals and stuff like that, so I may be able to.
[02:01:00.723 --> 02:01:01.504]  If I can, I will.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:05.502]  I don't have security clearances and contacts like you do.
[02:01:05.602 --> 02:01:06.582]  Well, thank you Chuck.
[02:01:06.602 --> 02:01:07.663]  I appreciate the call.
[02:01:07.683 --> 02:01:08.704]  I'll try to answer that.
[02:01:09.524 --> 02:01:11.545]  Listen, I know this.
[02:01:11.625 --> 02:01:15.367]  The governments of the world are the biggest polluters, bar none.
[02:01:16.127 --> 02:01:22.651]  And I know that basically Area 51 has a lot more to do with toxic waste than it does with ray guns.
[02:01:23.231 --> 02:01:26.533]  I mean, they admit that there's just masses of toxic waste dumped out there.
[02:01:28.434 --> 02:01:30.455]  And so that's a big part of it.
[02:01:31.513 --> 02:01:37.020]  But then it's the government that's going to take all your rights to keep you safe from environmental degradation.
[02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:39.544]  Oh, we'll take your ranch and build a hotel on it.
[02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:40.946]  That will save Mother Earth.
[02:01:40.986 --> 02:01:47.616]  But meanwhile, we'll let Monsanto go around planting genetically engineered crops that then take over the entire biosphere.
[02:01:49.258 --> 02:01:52.941]  It doesn't matter if all these top scientists say it's totally deadly and dangerous.
[02:01:53.241 --> 02:01:54.061]  We'll just do that.
[02:01:54.101 --> 02:01:58.284]  Or, you know, the Russian government's all for Kyoto Protocol, but they don't have to make any cuts.
[02:01:58.645 --> 02:02:05.069]  And they routinely dump nuclear reactors in major bodies of water in their country that are used as reservoirs.
[02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:07.651]  Again, it's craziness.
[02:02:07.911 --> 02:02:10.132]  Here, let's just throw an old reactor in a lake.
[02:02:11.453 --> 02:02:12.354]  And then we'll drink it.
[02:02:14.091 --> 02:02:17.653]  It's like our government using DU when they know it's radioactive and deadly poison.
[02:02:17.693 --> 02:02:18.934]  I mean, deadly, deadly, deadly.
[02:02:19.094 --> 02:02:27.318]  And they use it knowing it's going to... From the first Gulf War, the birth deformities are triple what it is in any other population.
[02:02:28.399 --> 02:02:31.440]  And now the numbers are coming out three years into Iraq.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.301]  It's even worse!
[02:02:33.662 --> 02:02:36.863]  So, again, it's a crazy disconnect.
[02:02:38.144 --> 02:02:42.827]  We'll come back after this quick break.
[02:02:42.847 --> 02:02:43.167]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.743 --> 02:02:47.223]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.403 --> 02:02:50.504]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.624 --> 02:02:54.525]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.585 --> 02:02:58.786]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.166 --> 02:03:02.927]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.067 --> 02:03:04.928]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.048 --> 02:03:08.389]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.409 --> 02:03:09.489]  The medical bills!
[02:03:11.110 --> 02:03:13.131]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.291 --> 02:03:16.333]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.493 --> 02:03:19.375]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.856 --> 02:03:25.960]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:30.304]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.704 --> 02:03:32.066]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.446 --> 02:03:33.467]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.487 --> 02:03:35.769]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.829 --> 02:03:37.070]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:45.078 --> 02:03:48.559]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.819 --> 02:03:52.339]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.419 --> 02:03:56.360]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:02.741]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.141 --> 02:04:11.063]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.463 --> 02:04:16.824]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:04:16.964 --> 02:04:20.745]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.105 --> 02:04:22.946]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:04:23.026 --> 02:04:25.187]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.427 --> 02:04:30.688]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.728 --> 02:04:36.129]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:43.191]  That's 808-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:44.151 --> 02:04:45.632]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:04:45.972 --> 02:04:49.913]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:04:50.313 --> 02:04:53.814]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:04:54.214 --> 02:04:57.755]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:04:58.156 --> 02:05:03.017]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:05:03.337 --> 02:05:09.140]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:13.162]  I now wear my Tri-Vibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:05:13.502 --> 02:05:15.583]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:05:15.923 --> 02:05:21.686]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:05:22.106 --> 02:05:23.306]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:05:23.627 --> 02:05:24.727]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:05:24.827 --> 02:05:30.229]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[02:05:30.449 --> 02:05:33.910]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:35.491]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[02:05:35.531 --> 02:05:35.811]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:05:46.434 --> 02:05:48.635]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.195 --> 02:05:52.036]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.136 --> 02:06:00.538]  Let me talk a little bit more about Halliburton and its FEMA camps.
[02:06:02.878 --> 02:06:12.701]  And then we'll go to Bertrand and Evelyn and I think that'll probably be it for calls today because I've got a guest coming up in about 12 minutes or so and I want to air a couple audio clips here as well.
[02:06:13.872 --> 02:06:26.253]  But at the end of the last hour, I read the article, Halliburton Detention Camps for Political Subversives by Paul Joseph Watson from PrisonPlanet.com, but it actually says that in the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press in the articles that we got this from.
[02:06:26.313 --> 02:06:26.674]  It says,
[02:06:27.435 --> 02:06:29.536]  Oh, to deal with illegal aliens, to put them in it.
[02:06:29.576 --> 02:06:31.397]  But we know Bush wants total blanket amnesty.
[02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:32.597]  It's what he called for last night.
[02:06:32.917 --> 02:06:44.182]  His guest worker program is total amnesty, but he says we must reject amnesty and have the guest worker program, which was written by the Democrats, and which admittedly is total amnesty.
[02:06:44.222 --> 02:06:45.202]  We've read the bill on air.
[02:06:46.402 --> 02:06:54.906]  But it's like the NSA chief at the National Press Cup last week saying, no, the Fourth Amendment does not say probable cause.
[02:06:54.946 --> 02:06:55.506]  No, it doesn't!
[02:06:56.132 --> 02:06:57.353]  And then you go read it, and it does.
[02:06:58.173 --> 02:07:01.654]  That they just count on you not going and checking it out.
[02:07:03.295 --> 02:07:10.558]  But what's so scary about Halliburton doing this is its subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, has been in the foreign press and in the Chicago Tribune of all places.
[02:07:11.238 --> 02:07:12.939]  Even the governor of Illinois has criticized them.
[02:07:13.719 --> 02:07:15.780]  They have a lobbyist in D.C.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:25.584]  lobbying to keep the Pentagon from enforcing existing law against their contractors engaged in white slavery in Europe and Asia and Central Asia and the Middle East.
[02:07:27.435 --> 02:07:31.658]  The same people involved in this, see, it just can't happen over there.
[02:07:31.698 --> 02:07:32.718]  It's going to happen over here.
[02:07:32.798 --> 02:07:34.480]  That's just all a training camp over there.
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:35.800]  That's all a big simulation.
[02:07:36.021 --> 02:07:36.881]  That's a laboratory.
[02:07:36.901 --> 02:07:38.142]  They call Iraq a laboratory.
[02:07:38.162 --> 02:07:39.583]  They call Serbia a laboratory.
[02:07:42.104 --> 02:07:44.986]  And yes, you didn't tune into the outer limits of the Twilight Zone.
[02:07:45.106 --> 02:07:49.109]  Yes, I said concentration camps run by people that run child kidnapping ranks.
[02:07:50.882 --> 02:07:54.926]  And yes, I'll be here saying it, God willing, tomorrow and a month from now, just like I was saying it five years.
[02:07:55.206 --> 02:07:56.207]  And how do I get away with it?
[02:07:56.247 --> 02:07:57.128]  Just because you don't believe it?
[02:07:57.228 --> 02:07:58.029]  Because it's true.
[02:07:58.089 --> 02:07:58.570]  That's why.
[02:07:59.390 --> 02:08:00.692]  Because the truth stands.
[02:08:01.372 --> 02:08:03.775]  That's the absolute defense to libel and slander.
[02:08:05.036 --> 02:08:07.959]  That's why I was here twelve years ago, and God willing, I'll be here in twelve years.
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:12.363]  And the only reason I say that is because I know some of you are just going, that ain't true.
[02:08:12.803 --> 02:08:13.864]  Because you're a new listener.
[02:08:13.964 --> 02:08:15.406]  Believe me, Jack, it's true.
[02:08:16.602 --> 02:08:20.984]  The veneer of civilization is very, very thin.
[02:08:21.505 --> 02:08:23.586]  Life is extremely cheap.
[02:08:24.786 --> 02:08:29.409]  There's six and a half billion people on the face of the globe right now.
[02:08:29.449 --> 02:08:32.851]  And every time I say that I get an email going, it's six billion, two hundred million.
[02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:33.591]  That's old numbers.
[02:08:33.651 --> 02:08:35.092]  It's six and a half billion now.
[02:08:35.112 --> 02:08:35.952]  That's the official numbers.
[02:08:36.253 --> 02:08:36.873]  Probably higher.
[02:08:38.238 --> 02:08:40.839]  And some say it could be really near 7 billion.
[02:08:40.899 --> 02:08:41.919]  It's that many people.
[02:08:42.419 --> 02:08:44.440]  And life is the cheapest thing out there.
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:52.783]  And folks, the globalists openly have written a hundred policy reports plus I've read on air where they say they're going to use terrorism to hurt us in the compact cities.
[02:08:53.063 --> 02:08:55.264]  They're going to have controlled plagues and they're going to exterminate us.
[02:08:55.284 --> 02:08:57.864]  And they're going to use one child policy and other things to do it.
[02:08:58.845 --> 02:08:59.465]  And they mean it.
[02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:07.051]  And this isn't a joke, and believe me, this is the real world, and I'm sorry, brutal, cold-blooded killers are in control.
[02:09:07.231 --> 02:09:13.572]  They're in control because they are ruthless, and because you, and our forefathers, have become gullible and soft.
[02:09:13.872 --> 02:09:25.575]  You know, when I'm at the mall, or I'm in a store, I was in a store last night, and I was just looking at how self-centered, and happy, and goofy, and simple 45-year-old men were.
[02:09:29.844 --> 02:09:32.322]  And you can stop and try to talk to him.
[02:09:33.169 --> 02:09:39.354]  It's just all they're thinking about is how to act cool and how to have status and they're like in their own little bubbles.
[02:09:39.714 --> 02:09:44.998]  They don't know how raw and brutal and savage the world is.
[02:09:45.038 --> 02:09:50.362]  They don't know all of our forefathers and foremothers who fought and died to have a little bit of freedom.
[02:09:50.563 --> 02:09:55.046]  They don't know about how freedom is always a struggle and fought for bloodily.
[02:09:55.727 --> 02:09:57.428]  It's blood, sweat, and tears.
[02:09:57.488 --> 02:10:01.051]  I mean, just struggles, back-breaking struggles.
[02:10:02.634 --> 02:10:03.855]  To have a little bit of freedom.
[02:10:03.915 --> 02:10:04.836]  How rare it is!
[02:10:05.918 --> 02:10:07.619]  And people just don't know.
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:09.922]  They just don't know.
[02:10:09.942 --> 02:10:13.826]  And they're so gullible.
[02:10:13.846 --> 02:10:14.987]  They're so childlike.
[02:10:15.027 --> 02:10:16.048]  They're so innocent.
[02:10:17.249 --> 02:10:18.671]  They're so simple-minded.
[02:10:18.731 --> 02:10:22.455]  They can't even fathom how evil the elite is.
[02:10:22.855 --> 02:10:24.277]  How bloodthirsty they are.
[02:10:25.518 --> 02:10:30.241]  Because a normal person couldn't be in these elite positions and do the evil things they do and survive.
[02:10:30.281 --> 02:10:31.342]  You would self-destruct.
[02:10:31.682 --> 02:10:34.103]  A normal person would fall apart if you have a conscience.
[02:10:34.143 --> 02:10:34.884]  If you're normal.
[02:10:35.184 --> 02:10:36.545]  If you're connected in with God.
[02:10:36.565 --> 02:10:39.327]  If you're connected in with decency and love and beauty.
[02:10:39.347 --> 02:10:41.068]  If you have a soft heart.
[02:10:42.774 --> 02:10:45.675]  No, the elite actually enjoy what they do.
[02:10:46.015 --> 02:10:54.657]  And listen to me, you know in your guts out there listening, unless you've totally been blinded, unless your heart's totally hard, you know what I'm saying is true.
[02:10:54.897 --> 02:10:58.478]  I want you to go check out the facts of what I'm claiming and find out it is true for yourself.
[02:10:58.878 --> 02:11:04.220]  But you already know in your guts, in your soul, in your heart, in that hidden place deep down,
[02:11:05.302 --> 02:11:14.909]  Deep down, police officers, military, school teachers, bureaucrats, doctors, lawyers listening right now, you already have seen enough of what I'm saying for yourself.
[02:11:14.969 --> 02:11:16.089]  You already can feel it.
[02:11:16.450 --> 02:11:20.032]  Already your human instinct for survival is telling you, listen to him.
[02:11:20.392 --> 02:11:21.613]  Listen to Alex Jones.
[02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:23.014]  He's warning you.
[02:11:23.094 --> 02:11:24.295]  He speaks the truth.
[02:11:24.795 --> 02:11:26.376]  You know there's Veritas.
[02:11:28.958 --> 02:11:32.741]  So I beg you to do more than just sit there idly by.
[02:11:34.039 --> 02:11:35.740]  It happens to so many civilizations.
[02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:37.722]  It happens to the majority of countries.
[02:11:38.042 --> 02:11:41.005]  In fact, it happens to all of them over time.
[02:11:41.505 --> 02:11:42.106]  Guaranteed!
[02:11:42.386 --> 02:11:44.768]  Evil takes over and mass murders and does horrible things.
[02:11:45.068 --> 02:11:45.428]  Why?
[02:11:45.488 --> 02:11:46.649]  Because that's the nature.
[02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:48.911]  Because evil is a real thing.
[02:11:49.171 --> 02:11:51.894]  Because control freaks love to do bad things.
[02:11:52.194 --> 02:11:57.178]  Because smart serial killers team up together to feed on us.
[02:11:58.919 --> 02:12:00.641]  They have organizations
[02:12:02.436 --> 02:12:03.556]  They work together.
[02:12:03.936 --> 02:12:05.937]  Donald Rumsfeld is a psychopath.
[02:12:06.037 --> 02:12:06.957]  He's a killer.
[02:12:07.837 --> 02:12:09.038]  He gets off on it.
[02:12:09.958 --> 02:12:14.439]  You can see him when he talks about torture, the smirk, the smile, the licking of the lips.
[02:12:14.819 --> 02:12:16.300]  He's on a power trip.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:18.280]  The man is darkness.
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:19.120]  He is evil.
[02:12:19.401 --> 02:12:21.701]  He's one of the most evil people I've ever looked at.
[02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:22.941]  He radiates evil.
[02:12:23.182 --> 02:12:24.562]  But I don't have to go off of his looks.
[02:12:24.882 --> 02:12:25.942]  Oh, the looks do match.
[02:12:26.442 --> 02:12:28.483]  There are some people who are evil who radiate the opposite.
[02:12:29.694 --> 02:12:30.714]  It's his actions.
[02:12:30.794 --> 02:12:33.035]  The man is a wrecking ball.
[02:12:36.856 --> 02:12:38.616]  They love it.
[02:12:39.697 --> 02:12:44.538]  And when you start understanding that, when you realize, you know, why do serial killers do what they do?
[02:12:44.578 --> 02:12:45.858]  Why do evil people do what they do?
[02:12:45.878 --> 02:12:47.119]  Because they're evil!
[02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:48.199]  That's what they do!
[02:12:48.259 --> 02:12:49.199]  That's who they are!
[02:12:54.039 --> 02:13:10.353]  So we have Halliburton now, in a first installment, $385 million a year to build and refurbish and expand emergency centers all over the United States for national emergencies.
[02:13:12.035 --> 02:13:13.816]  And again, who's going to run the camps?
[02:13:14.717 --> 02:13:17.900]  The very divisions of Kellogg, Brown, and Root
[02:13:19.150 --> 02:13:20.152]  I mean, God help us.
[02:13:20.172 --> 02:13:20.593]  And it's people.
[02:13:20.613 --> 02:13:21.715]  These divisions are people.
[02:13:32.526 --> 02:13:41.574]  By the jail guards that have washed up, the jail guards that got fired, the jail guards that like to abuse, the jail guards who were so bad they got written up or lost their job.
[02:13:41.775 --> 02:13:42.856]  They're all being recruited.
[02:13:43.196 --> 02:13:47.760]  They're having sergeants bars slapped on their arms and heaven help us.
[02:13:48.281 --> 02:13:49.762]  These are Mingolas.
[02:13:50.723 --> 02:13:57.109]  Mingolas who have grown fat on the blood of people overseas and they want to do it here.
[02:13:58.857 --> 02:14:01.158]  And I'm not trying to scare you folks, it's happening.
[02:14:01.619 --> 02:14:04.140]  And the whole economy is being handed over to their cronies.
[02:14:05.201 --> 02:14:09.303]  Death Squad commanders are being made the heads of the federal agencies.
[02:14:10.423 --> 02:14:13.005]  Negroponte, Chertoff, others.
[02:14:13.045 --> 02:14:15.306]  These men, these men are literal ringwraiths.
[02:14:15.326 --> 02:14:17.007]  These men are dark generals.
[02:14:17.127 --> 02:14:17.988]  These men are evil incarnate.
[02:14:26.883 --> 02:14:27.804]  Palpable evil.
[02:14:27.884 --> 02:14:29.507]  I look at them and I shiver.
[02:14:29.687 --> 02:14:30.888]  I know our enemy.
[02:14:31.329 --> 02:14:31.910]  You can look at them.
[02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:33.932]  They are energized with power.
[02:14:34.393 --> 02:14:35.675]  Dark power.
[02:14:37.356 --> 02:14:38.717]  They can't wait.
[02:14:38.877 --> 02:14:40.337]  You are the target.
[02:14:40.437 --> 02:14:42.798]  Do not make any mistake.
[02:14:42.939 --> 02:14:49.641]  Everywhere they go, they slaughter, they rape, they murder, they target the innocents, and they're trying to give you their taste.
[02:14:49.862 --> 02:15:04.368]  They're trying to take the cops and the military and the media, and they go on TV and say we can torture children, and the sitcoms and the dramas all promoted in unison together, trying to sell us on the climate they want to live in.
[02:15:05.555 --> 02:15:08.076]  They're trying to turn our world into hell.
[02:15:08.816 --> 02:15:11.597]  Because that's what they like, because that's what they are.
[02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.077]  They're from hell.
[02:15:14.278 --> 02:15:15.538]  Do you understand that?
[02:15:16.098 --> 02:15:17.999]  And they're scared of you getting involved.
[02:15:18.179 --> 02:15:24.141]  And they're scared of you being powerful and bringing them to justice.
[02:15:26.041 --> 02:15:29.142]  You think we have a shiver when we look at them and know what they are?
[02:15:29.182 --> 02:15:31.263]  They shiver when they see us.
[02:15:32.103 --> 02:15:33.864]  Because we're the opposite of them.
[02:15:34.918 --> 02:15:49.245]  And for everything that's beautiful, and everything that's sweet, and everything that's dear, and everything that's innocent, and everything that is wholesome, and everything that is pure, and everything that is dynamic, and creative, and vibrant, and wonderful.
[02:15:49.666 --> 02:15:51.947]  Everything good is in the balance.
[02:15:52.227 --> 02:15:57.390]  They are raping and destroying the very fabric of life on the planet with genetic engineering.
[02:15:57.710 --> 02:15:59.531]  They are warping the human species.
[02:15:59.791 --> 02:16:00.951]  They are poisoning.
[02:16:01.192 --> 02:16:02.492]  They are diseasing.
[02:16:02.512 --> 02:16:03.693]  It is their nature!
[02:16:05.865 --> 02:16:19.733]  And if you won't ride out on the field, in your one life to live, in that vapor that vanishes in the dawn that is life, if you won't be counted now, you are going to be fed to this machine.
[02:16:20.393 --> 02:16:31.620]  Let me tell you something, the people that serve it, the people that make jokes about it, the people that say, you know, it's not true, the people who don't stand up against evil, you're the first that are going into the furnace.
[02:16:32.936 --> 02:16:34.937]  And I don't mean when you die some hell.
[02:16:35.118 --> 02:16:37.659]  I mean in the tyranny of today.
[02:16:37.679 --> 02:16:42.062]  And let me tell the minions of this system, those that willingly serve it.
[02:16:43.363 --> 02:16:44.143]  I've looked at history.
[02:16:44.203 --> 02:16:44.724]  I've studied it.
[02:16:45.164 --> 02:16:47.345]  You are in the greatest danger.
[02:16:47.405 --> 02:16:50.507]  You think you're safe under the black wings of your king.
[02:16:51.188 --> 02:16:55.090]  You think you're safe under the towers of the New World Order.
[02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:58.813]  You think you're safe in your dark regalia.
[02:16:59.807 --> 02:17:01.588]  You are the first to be used!
[02:17:01.608 --> 02:17:04.190]  You are the first to be mistrusted by your masters!
[02:17:04.470 --> 02:17:05.390]  You are the first!
[02:17:05.510 --> 02:17:08.472]  It is the elite's pleasure to crush their servants!
[02:17:10.018 --> 02:17:18.062]  They are afraid of you even more than they're afraid of me because they know that you'll stab them in the back in a minute just to get power.
[02:17:18.562 --> 02:17:20.943]  They know that you don't want to be their apprentice.
[02:17:21.363 --> 02:17:23.885]  They know that you don't want to go along with them.
[02:17:24.065 --> 02:17:28.207]  So let me tell you something evil psychopaths out there listening to me right now.
[02:17:28.887 --> 02:17:30.448]  You're the first to go.
[02:17:30.768 --> 02:17:33.489]  So you just huddle up underneath those black wings.
[02:17:33.749 --> 02:17:35.590]  You be part of that little brood.
[02:17:36.170 --> 02:17:37.351]  You think you're safe?
[02:17:38.323 --> 02:17:41.324]  Let me tell you something, you're gonna pay in this life!
[02:17:41.665 --> 02:17:43.205]  It's a 110% guaranteed!
[02:17:46.047 --> 02:17:50.028]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:53.930]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[02:17:54.390 --> 02:17:57.612]  Cardivite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[02:17:58.012 --> 02:18:02.594]  Made from seven herbs, Cardivite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[02:18:02.974 --> 02:18:04.575]  Here's what one person has to say.
[02:18:04.895 --> 02:18:08.578]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[02:18:08.738 --> 02:18:12.582]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[02:18:12.802 --> 02:18:13.983]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[02:18:14.183 --> 02:18:14.704]  It didn't do.
[02:18:14.804 --> 02:18:16.805]  The only thing that worked was your Cardivite.
[02:18:17.186 --> 02:18:19.508]  If you believe Cardivite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.
[02:18:19.568 --> 02:18:20.008]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:18:20.028 --> 02:18:21.209]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[02:18:32.939 --> 02:18:37.283]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[02:18:37.663 --> 02:18:41.306]  Cartabyte is an all-natural supplement, so call today!
[02:18:41.326 --> 02:18:42.507]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:18:46.350 --> 02:18:50.033]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:50.434 --> 02:18:55.858]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:56.319 --> 02:18:57.399]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:18:57.439 --> 02:19:01.483]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:02.123 --> 02:19:15.427]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:15.447 --> 02:19:21.248]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:21.528 --> 02:19:27.350]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:19:28.172 --> 02:19:29.514]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.654 --> 02:19:34.199]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.241]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.301 --> 02:19:37.463]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:19:37.483 --> 02:19:37.543]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.976 --> 02:19:47.597]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:47.737 --> 02:19:51.859]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.979 --> 02:19:54.861]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.941 --> 02:20:01.624]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.684 --> 02:20:01.784]  Yes.
[02:20:01.824 --> 02:20:04.826]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:05.047 --> 02:20:07.428]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.568 --> 02:20:17.716]  Like murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aftazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:20:17.916 --> 02:20:27.044]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:20:27.184 --> 02:20:35.131]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:35.151 --> 02:20:35.391]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:35.472 --> 02:20:37.133]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:45.487 --> 02:20:52.593]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[02:20:53.233 --> 02:20:54.014]  I'm Tex Mars.
[02:20:54.434 --> 02:20:58.637]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.
[02:20:58.657 --> 02:21:02.220]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[02:21:02.761 --> 02:21:11.608]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[02:21:12.188 --> 02:21:15.834]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[02:21:16.115 --> 02:21:17.537]  Their mysterious symbols.
[02:21:17.878 --> 02:21:19.400]  Their hidden language.
[02:21:20.021 --> 02:21:20.903]  Encyclopedic.
[02:21:21.483 --> 02:21:22.104]  Documented.
[02:21:22.385 --> 02:21:26.492]  Codex Magicka unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.
[02:21:27.256 --> 02:21:36.527]  Please order your personal copy of Codex Magicka on the internet at PowerOfProphecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[02:21:36.547 --> 02:21:36.807]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[02:21:52.113 --> 02:21:52.833]  We're good to go.
[02:22:21.337 --> 02:22:26.881]  A few callers I said I'd get to, like Bertrand and Evelyn, and we'll get to you guys before this hour ends if you want to hold.
[02:22:26.921 --> 02:22:30.003]  If not, you can make the jump into hyperspace.
[02:22:30.063 --> 02:22:35.166]  But I canceled two guests today, and then I kind of pushed this one back, and I apologize.
[02:22:35.186 --> 02:22:39.269]  I just was Halliburton openly announcing that they're going to have domestic concentration camps.
[02:22:39.389 --> 02:22:40.570]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[02:22:42.151 --> 02:22:43.151]  I had to talk about that.
[02:22:43.171 --> 02:22:44.372]  There's so much happening.
[02:22:47.168 --> 02:22:49.870]  Eileen Dannemann has a long bio here.
[02:22:49.930 --> 02:22:50.771]  She does a lot of great work.
[02:22:50.791 --> 02:22:52.572]  We'll tell you about some of their websites and what they do.
[02:22:53.673 --> 02:22:59.118]  She's the director of the National Coalition of Organized Women and co-founder of ProgressiveConvergence.com.
[02:23:00.799 --> 02:23:03.521]  She gets into how there's all these different factors.
[02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:10.246]  She was talking about an Iowa bill trying to basically force you to take vaccines and some of the other things that are happening.
[02:23:10.647 --> 02:23:15.550]  So I wanted her to give you an update on some of the other police state things that are developing going on.
[02:23:16.876 --> 02:23:18.328]  It's nice to have you on with us.
[02:23:18.752 --> 02:23:19.075]  Hello.
[02:23:20.758 --> 02:23:23.939]  You heard me just mention Halliburton's concentration camps.
[02:23:23.959 --> 02:23:24.839]  Were you aware of that?
[02:23:25.179 --> 02:23:25.499]  No, no.
[02:23:25.519 --> 02:23:26.959]  Give me a little rundown on that.
[02:23:26.999 --> 02:23:31.040]  Is that where the wires are going inward so people can't get out?
[02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:38.862]  Well, I mean, it's in the Houston Chronicle and AP and other publications that they're going to build emergency, national emergency camps to keep us all safe in.
[02:23:38.902 --> 02:23:40.922]  And yeah, Kellogg, Brown and Root's going to run that.
[02:23:41.182 --> 02:23:42.763]  Is that for the flu pandemic?
[02:23:42.823 --> 02:23:43.523]  Oh, what's that one for?
[02:23:43.703 --> 02:23:45.963]  Whatever it's for, but it just isn't this great!
[02:23:46.123 --> 02:23:48.964]  Well, did you see the New York Times on Sunday?
[02:23:50.414 --> 02:23:51.855]  Uh, what particular article?
[02:23:51.915 --> 02:24:07.059]  Well, it was by this, uh, by, it was New York Times Magazine, and it was about the, uh, the flu, uh, the avian flu virus that, that the CDC, um, dug up the body and recreated the actual Spanish flu that killed millions of people.
[02:24:07.299 --> 02:24:12.460]  Sure, I knew they'd dug it up five years ago, and then, of course, magically now it's threatening us, but I didn't know the New York Times had reported on it.
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:13.241]  Big, big time.
[02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:18.262]  New York Times and, and what it said, basically, to give you the layman's version of it, okay?
[02:24:18.917 --> 02:24:42.877]  is that they dug it up okay they recreated it and now they're experimenting with it by merging it with a ordinary flu okay now this supposedly Spanish flu that kills millions of people cannot jump really to human species and what really caused it was the eating of chickens
[02:24:43.795 --> 02:24:49.637]  And because it's sort of like AIDS, it has to go through like fluids, you know, and carcasses and such.
[02:24:50.217 --> 02:24:58.259]  But what the CDC is doing with their reconstruction is it's actually merging two viruses, the Spanish flu... Well, I was aware of what they were doing.
[02:24:58.279 --> 02:24:58.699]  I should have known.
[02:24:58.719 --> 02:24:59.659]  I've been in the New York Times.
[02:24:59.699 --> 02:25:02.400]  New York Times, Sunday, big time, great article.
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:11.182]  And then, of course, the big Republican Party strategy document that's been circulating around says they need terror attacks or a major disaster to get their agenda back on job.
[02:25:11.822 --> 02:25:16.547]  Oh yeah, well you know, we've got in March, you know, I do astrology and I'm thinking March is the day.
[02:25:16.888 --> 02:25:27.299]  I don't know whether, you know, we're going to see a bombing of the Super Bowl and then we can like level Iran, you know, or we're going to see now, Joyce Riley just told me that chickens
[02:25:28.126 --> 02:25:32.268]  They've actually accepted that we're going to accept chickens from China.
[02:25:32.649 --> 02:25:34.430]  I mean, I'm thinking, oh, that's really great.
[02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:35.670]  Chickens from China.
[02:25:36.011 --> 02:25:39.653]  We can, like, maybe stick the baby on flu and the chicken from China.
[02:25:39.673 --> 02:25:43.235]  We've got to give up all of our liberties and freedoms.
[02:25:44.923 --> 02:25:46.444]  But we're going to take chickens from China.
[02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:58.672]  Specifically, I wanted to get you on about House Bill 368 limits religious freedom and how they're going to try to force people to take vaccines.
[02:25:58.692 --> 02:25:59.973]  Okay, I've got to alert your people.
[02:25:59.993 --> 02:26:02.214]  This is what's happening deep, deep, deep, deep, okay?
[02:26:02.554 --> 02:26:04.456]  And this is going in other states and everything.
[02:26:04.756 --> 02:26:06.557]  Okay, what is really going on here?
[02:26:06.577 --> 02:26:08.458]  I spend a lot of time in Washington, D.C.
[02:26:08.739 --> 02:26:11.280]  What's really going on here is that
[02:26:12.816 --> 02:26:23.138]  The healthcare megaplex, which would be the pharmaceuticals and the healthcare industry and the Congress and all that, they're going to be creating a protocol.
[02:26:23.877 --> 02:26:41.302]  That if you don't, like say, for instance, you're 65 years old, you say, I don't want to take the flu shot, they say, if you don't take the flu shot, okay, we're going to, and they're doing this already, we're listing this on your record, and we're going to inform your health insurance company, and you're going to lose your health insurance.
[02:26:41.602 --> 02:26:44.503]  So what they're doing is... So it's going to be all color of law coercion.
[02:26:44.803 --> 02:26:45.543]  Yes, totally.
[02:26:45.603 --> 02:26:47.044]  It's like fascist health care.
[02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:51.325]  Okay, now, everyone is afraid they're going to get sick.
[02:26:51.738 --> 02:26:54.963]  Okay, and rightfully so with the situation on the earth today.
[02:26:55.323 --> 02:26:57.546]  And so they're very, very much afraid of losing their health insurance.
[02:26:57.806 --> 02:27:09.382]  So they're using that kind of leverage that if you don't get this shot... Hey, listen, if they can inject all the children with 22 vaccines by the time they're two years old, why not inject the grown-ups?
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:11.321]  Well, that's new freedom.
[02:27:11.501 --> 02:27:12.762]  Forced psychological testing.
[02:27:12.822 --> 02:27:14.082]  Forced drugging.
[02:27:14.182 --> 02:27:15.343]  When we get back, I'll talk about that.
[02:27:15.383 --> 02:27:16.404]  That's my big issue.
[02:27:16.844 --> 02:27:17.164]  Sure.
[02:27:17.364 --> 02:27:21.206]  And then, of course, their own documents out of Ohio, and one of their own people quit and released it.
[02:27:21.287 --> 02:27:21.547]  Sad.
[02:27:21.587 --> 02:27:22.567]  The drug company bragged.
[02:27:23.088 --> 02:27:24.508]  Yeah, we wrote up this whole plan.
[02:27:24.528 --> 02:27:26.229]  We'll get half the kids on drugs with this.
[02:27:26.930 --> 02:27:28.150]  It's openly a business plan.
[02:27:28.170 --> 02:27:30.612]  Just openly to force you to take their Prozac.
[02:27:31.152 --> 02:27:31.813]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.833 --> 02:27:32.233]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.315 --> 02:27:37.236]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.696 --> 02:27:39.217]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.226 --> 02:27:42.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.585 --> 02:27:52.947]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.167 --> 02:27:58.169]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.489 --> 02:28:06.412]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.552 --> 02:28:13.594]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.814 --> 02:28:15.036]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:15.176 --> 02:28:18.581]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.641 --> 02:28:19.742]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:20.043 --> 02:28:21.304]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:28.354]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:28.474 --> 02:28:30.918]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:34.099 --> 02:28:35.060]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:45.996 --> 02:28:52.220]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:58.523]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.824 --> 02:29:07.249]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.489 --> 02:29:14.513]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.813 --> 02:29:19.636]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.856 --> 02:29:25.260]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:28.682]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:29.023 --> 02:29:36.988]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.028 --> 02:29:37.608]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.813 --> 02:29:47.974]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?
[02:29:48.254 --> 02:29:54.177]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation.

[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:05.081]  Your child will listen to you again.

[02:30:10.743 --> 02:30:10.803]  1-800-373-0402.
[02:30:10.923 --> 02:30:22.870]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:24.411]  We got immediate results.
[02:30:24.911 --> 02:30:27.013]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[02:30:27.453 --> 02:30:35.758]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.

[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:40.820]  Eileen Danneman is our guest.
[02:30:40.860 --> 02:30:48.184]  We've got the new documentary, Loose Change 2, a great 9-11 video exposing government involvement.
[02:30:48.264 --> 02:30:50.965]  And, uh, Dylan Everett was gracious enough to, uh,
[02:31:05.535 --> 02:31:06.356]  Well, we're carrying it.
[02:31:06.636 --> 02:31:07.536]  We bought a bunch from him.
[02:31:08.157 --> 02:31:12.580]  And we have hard copies of that on DVD only available at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:15.902]  But we also have it up on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:31:16.502 --> 02:31:18.323]  Four members got it up there yesterday.
[02:31:19.384 --> 02:31:25.768]  All my films, a bunch of other great documentaries, my weekly TV reports, video interviews in studio here of the radio show.
[02:31:26.489 --> 02:31:28.630]  My book, Paul Watson's book, 15 cents a day.
[02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:34.254]  You can go for $5.95 a month, get a monthly membership, download, burn everything to disk, and then not have a membership anymore.
[02:31:35.638 --> 02:31:37.579]  Our goal is to just get the material out.
[02:31:37.619 --> 02:31:45.360]  So you can be an activist right now saying Australia, Japan, Germany, South Texas, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Canada.
[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.260]  Just start downloading now.
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:49.201]  You know, we have a lot of trouble getting my videos into Canada.
[02:31:49.221 --> 02:31:50.641]  There's real secret police up there.
[02:31:51.141 --> 02:31:52.021]  Russia is easier.
[02:31:53.842 --> 02:32:01.743]  Well, what's to stop you up there while you still can getting a membership and just downloading it all and burning it all to DVD or CD and giving it to people?
[02:32:02.685 --> 02:32:09.492]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, or 1-888-253-3139 to get the films.
[02:32:09.893 --> 02:32:20.263]  Okay, co-founder of ProgressiveConvergence.com, director of the National Coalition of Organized Women, and she's doing a great job all over the map fighting all this tyranny.
[02:32:20.343 --> 02:32:21.645]  Nothing to do with terrorists, just
[02:32:22.305 --> 02:32:27.850]  Big companies come lobby and say, force them to take 35 vaccines a year, and then up to 40 vaccines.
[02:32:27.890 --> 02:32:29.512]  We want to make adults take it.
[02:32:30.312 --> 02:32:35.357]  If you don't give your kid a vaccine and they get sick, anywhere down the line, we're going to criminally charge you.
[02:32:35.397 --> 02:32:42.083]  Then we have all the studies and reports of vaccines killing people, so the government says, we'll just give you total blanket liability protection.
[02:32:42.663 --> 02:32:43.724]  And then we've got new freedom.
[02:32:43.924 --> 02:33:00.594]  But before we get into new freedom that passed last year and now being implemented at the state level, Eileen, you've got some great analysis on this Iowa situation where they're going after religious freedoms and trying to force vaccination and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:33:00.614 --> 02:33:01.234]  Tell us about that.
[02:33:01.575 --> 02:33:04.636]  Yeah, so at the hearing yesterday,
[02:33:05.997 --> 02:33:23.682]  It is against the Christian scientists and myself and a few others was the AMA and the American Pediatrics and blah blah blah blah blah and I can say this to anybody who's listening who might be having this in their own state where they're actually trying to take out the religious exemptions
[02:33:24.381 --> 02:33:28.882]  Um, is to take the tact of constitutional freedom.
[02:33:29.702 --> 02:33:31.083]  Uh, the freedom of religion.
[02:33:31.323 --> 02:33:32.363]  That's the only thing that works.
[02:33:32.543 --> 02:33:42.806]  As much as we like to say, you know, there's been, uh, you know, hundreds and thousands and thousands of deaths by medicines, the only thing that appears to work is the idea that, um,
[02:33:43.445 --> 02:33:45.005]  Or what we call the freedom of religion?
[02:33:45.025 --> 02:33:49.047]  The government's own number is 350 plus thousand a year by malpractice.
[02:33:49.367 --> 02:33:51.347]  Hundreds of times the death rate from guns.
[02:33:51.947 --> 02:33:53.808]  Many times the rate from automobile accidents.
[02:33:53.828 --> 02:33:55.108]  And I'm not even knocking doctors.
[02:33:55.188 --> 02:33:58.709]  It's just that the system itself is so riddled with fraud.
[02:33:58.989 --> 02:34:05.851]  And look, if somebody's got a broken leg, a compound fracture, and the Christian Scientist parents don't want to get it mended, I think that's weird.
[02:34:05.891 --> 02:34:09.192]  And I almost lean on letting the local sheriff come grab the kid and fix the leg.
[02:34:10.152 --> 02:34:12.055]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:34:12.295 --> 02:34:18.883]  These vaccines are so deadly on the face of it, governments so corrupt throughout history, I'm against the government having the power.
[02:34:19.284 --> 02:34:19.464]  Right.
[02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:29.983]  Well, the thing is, is that what we call the Freedom of Religion Clause in the Bill of Rights, which we'd like to honor, is really an expression of a much deeper principle, and that is freedom of conscience.
[02:34:30.043 --> 02:34:31.404]  You know, we have to respect the individual.
[02:34:31.784 --> 02:34:34.926]  The freedom of conscience is one of the founding principles of our democracy.
[02:34:35.226 --> 02:34:42.931]  And hey, our democracy was found on freedom of religion, and they have the nerve to say that we can't have a religious excuse not to take this garbage?
[02:34:43.405 --> 02:34:48.029]  Well, I mean, imagine telling the founding fathers that, you know, you have to inject your children with things.
[02:34:48.069 --> 02:34:50.431]  I mean, the Republic is not about that.
[02:34:50.811 --> 02:34:53.213]  But, I mean, specifically, you were there at the state hearing.
[02:34:53.253 --> 02:34:54.974]  Tell them what they're trying to do.
[02:34:54.994 --> 02:34:56.635]  And this is happening all over the country.
[02:34:56.735 --> 02:35:01.799]  What they're trying to do is that, in the Iowa Criminal Code, there is this religious exemption.
[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:11.347]  And what they're trying to do is take it out, which means, basically, that if a child dies under your parent's care, the parent
[02:35:11.812 --> 02:35:22.800]  Will be automatically taken up for criminal charges if they did not give the child quote-unquote appropriate treatment.
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:27.283]  And then these private industries write what appropriate treatment is and that's 35-40 vaccines.
[02:35:27.303 --> 02:35:28.264]  But let me add this.
[02:35:28.864 --> 02:35:32.066]  I have the federal government Health and Human Services own numbers from 2002.
[02:35:32.947 --> 02:35:36.549]  I haven't looked them up since then but I'm told it's gotten worse than everything else.
[02:35:37.050 --> 02:35:41.353]  Do you know how many times more likely you are to die in government foster care custody?
[02:35:42.077 --> 02:35:46.520]  Five times more likely in government foster care than in the parents' care.
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:52.563]  So, who are they, five times worse on average than us, to be saying they set the parameters?
[02:35:52.863 --> 02:35:56.445]  Yeah, and there's only, like, I can't even find how many people die on natural medicines.
[02:35:56.526 --> 02:35:57.786]  I can't even find the statistics.
[02:35:57.806 --> 02:35:58.527]  There's, like, one.
[02:35:59.637 --> 02:36:01.318]  Well we've proven, we've proven this.
[02:36:15.723 --> 02:36:19.645]  Sudden Fetal Death Syndrome, and then they blame the parents for shaking the baby.
[02:36:19.965 --> 02:36:31.391]  They've directly linked it in a whole bunch of post-mortem autopsies that the little kid has in a reaction to mercury, dies in their crib, and then the cops come and arrest you when the government killed your kid!
[02:36:31.531 --> 02:36:31.991]  Exactly.
[02:36:32.031 --> 02:36:37.934]  I spend a lot of time in Washington with the vaccine specialists in the know who have kind of crossed the line on our side, you know?
[02:36:38.374 --> 02:36:41.956]  And who have been spending a lot, a lot of time for many, many, many years with the CDC.
[02:36:42.236 --> 02:36:44.077]  Now I've got a breaking news for you, Alex.
[02:36:45.788 --> 02:36:47.911]  Something that you haven't ever heard before.
[02:36:48.251 --> 02:36:48.571]  Okay.
[02:36:48.812 --> 02:36:49.072]  Okay?
[02:36:49.412 --> 02:36:58.603]  You know, of course, of the 20 years that the Centers for Disease Control, you know, has actually injected directly into our bloodstream, 20 years so far, to kids
[02:36:59.178 --> 02:37:06.405]  Between the ages of 12 hours old and 2 years old, at least 22 vaccines, 15 of which have high, high levels of mercury, okay?
[02:37:06.705 --> 02:37:16.073]  Now, we know that this atrocity, this epidemic of ADHD, ADD, ADD, is caused by... By the way, by the way, that isn't Eileen Dannemann's opinion.
[02:37:16.374 --> 02:37:17.795]  The CDC documents
[02:37:18.235 --> 02:37:18.836]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:18.876 --> 02:37:20.097]  That's an exact quote.
[02:37:20.177 --> 02:37:21.478]  Dig with the cover-up.
[02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:22.658]  This is the thing, okay?
[02:37:22.678 --> 02:37:24.860]  So they're covering up, okay?
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.483]  And this is all documented on my website, on VaccineInfo, you name it, it's all documented.
[02:37:28.503 --> 02:37:28.883]  Okay.
[02:37:28.903 --> 02:37:33.627]  What the cover-up is here, let me just read this here to you because I wrote it so well, okay?
[02:37:47.938 --> 02:37:52.018]  Anyway, of course this has caused untold damage to the entire generation.
[02:37:52.158 --> 02:37:52.319]  Now...
[02:37:53.206 --> 02:37:59.390]  Because the CDC will not admit to their culpability for fear of legal action, but yet, they're reducing the mercury out.
[02:37:59.610 --> 02:37:59.890]  Why?
[02:37:59.910 --> 02:38:02.712]  You ask them, well, how come if it's not a problem, are you reducing it out?
[02:38:02.992 --> 02:38:05.153]  And they say, oh, well, precautionary principle.
[02:38:05.213 --> 02:38:06.954]  Well, why all of a sudden is there a precautionary principle?
[02:38:07.194 --> 02:38:10.636]  So meanwhile, they're reducing it out, but they won't admit that it's a problem.
[02:38:10.676 --> 02:38:13.678]  So therefore, parents can say, yay, what's the matter with my kid?
[02:38:13.698 --> 02:38:15.359]  Is it a little personality dysfunction?
[02:38:15.539 --> 02:38:16.460]  The kid can't cope?
[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:17.981]  Oh, there's something wrong with the kid.
[02:38:18.041 --> 02:38:18.861]  Okay, so fine.
[02:38:19.081 --> 02:38:21.723]  Now, what's happening is this, in the deep, dark,
[02:38:22.363 --> 02:38:39.197]  ...of the CDC with conversation between some people I know and some people I know, is that the CDC knows that in 2008 to 2014, there's going to be a peak crisis of these children who have been injected with the mercury.
[02:38:39.764 --> 02:38:41.446]  Now, these children are very aggressive.
[02:38:41.486 --> 02:38:47.432]  It's not like, you know, Idiot Savant, you know, Dustin Hoffman gentleness.
[02:38:47.552 --> 02:38:48.893]  It's very aggressive.
[02:38:49.874 --> 02:38:58.303]  Dr. Mark Geyer and David Geyer have found out that testosterone levels are very, very high with these children and they're very, very aggressive.
[02:38:58.323 --> 02:39:00.365]  So the CDC knows that between 2008 and 2014 there will be a big
[02:39:02.512 --> 02:39:03.333]  Well, I've heard that.
[02:39:03.353 --> 02:39:07.536]  I think that may be a shill and then a shill, but that is an interesting new angle.
[02:39:07.597 --> 02:39:09.538]  And you've heard that from people inside the CDC?
[02:39:28.283 --> 02:39:32.526]  I've heard it from people talking inside the CDC to people outside the CDC.
[02:39:32.666 --> 02:39:35.688]  Let me just give people the official government numbers.
[02:39:35.948 --> 02:39:39.490]  24 years ago, 1 in 25,000 children was autistic.
[02:39:39.570 --> 02:39:43.012]  Now it's 1 in 166 in 04 numbers.
[02:39:43.832 --> 02:39:44.893]  05 numbers are about to come out.
[02:39:44.913 --> 02:39:45.974]  They always come out a year late.
[02:39:46.254 --> 02:39:48.575]  And it looks like it's going to be a 1 in 65.
[02:39:48.876 --> 02:39:50.136]  And that's not over diagnosis.
[02:39:50.196 --> 02:39:51.617]  I mean, these are kids who are gone.
[02:39:52.138 --> 02:39:53.538]  I went on vacation last week.
[02:39:53.558 --> 02:39:54.419]  I just went down to the beach.
[02:39:55.726 --> 02:39:56.147]  I don't think so.
[02:40:15.928 --> 02:40:18.451]  I said, when did your son become autistic?
[02:40:18.492 --> 02:40:20.134]  She said, it's the same story always.
[02:40:20.534 --> 02:40:21.375]  Oh, he was just fine.
[02:40:21.395 --> 02:40:23.298]  He was talking, giggling, running, laughing.
[02:40:23.838 --> 02:40:28.985]  And we went in, and when he was 18 months old, it just one day, it just started after a doctor's visit.
[02:40:29.025 --> 02:40:32.910]  I said, oh, he got his last round of vaccines, and then it happened a day later?
[02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:33.511]  She said, yes.
[02:40:34.171 --> 02:40:39.793]  And now all he does is sit there and twiddle his fingers in front of his face, which they knew 100 years ago was mercury poisoning.
[02:40:40.413 --> 02:40:45.695]  And she said, yeah, I'm part of the big autism group, and yeah, they all say it's that now.
[02:40:45.795 --> 02:40:55.718]  And now at public schools, where 20 years ago there wasn't one autistic kid in the whole city, now in major high schools there are whole rooms per grade of these kids.
[02:40:56.158 --> 02:40:57.399]  And imagine when it's 1 in 60!
[02:40:59.063 --> 02:41:00.424]  And I mean, just imagine!
[02:41:00.484 --> 02:41:02.025]  And they know!
[02:41:02.125 --> 02:41:02.666]  They know!
[02:41:02.766 --> 02:41:06.028]  And by the way, you know they didn't really take the mercury out of the vaccines.
[02:41:06.348 --> 02:41:06.989]  I know that.
[02:41:07.149 --> 02:41:09.711]  It's been a quote, unquote, reduced.
[02:41:09.871 --> 02:41:13.493]  Gerberding, you know, the CDC director, I saw her at a hearing.
[02:41:13.533 --> 02:41:16.335]  She actually said, full flame, this is a totally fraud.
[02:41:16.355 --> 02:41:19.718]  She said this, we have removed
[02:41:22.156 --> 02:41:26.039]  Thimerosal as a preservative in all children's vaccines.
[02:41:26.059 --> 02:41:26.900]  This is in a hearing.
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:28.542]  Now what does that mean to you, most people?
[02:41:28.582 --> 02:41:32.565]  We have removed thimerosal as a preservative in all children's vaccines.
[02:41:32.765 --> 02:41:34.186]  Now they're calling it a stabilizer.
[02:41:34.267 --> 02:41:35.408]  No, no, exactly.
[02:41:35.428 --> 02:41:41.012]  The caveat is we have removed thimerosal as a preservative, but it's still in there.
[02:41:41.112 --> 02:41:43.334]  Well, I even have an Associated Press report about that.
[02:41:43.354 --> 02:41:46.177]  Did you know in some vaccines they actually increase the level?
[02:41:47.397 --> 02:41:49.978]  In the flu shot, they went to 250 times safe level.
[02:41:50.018 --> 02:41:51.739]  Like, you guys don't want to take your shot?
[02:41:51.899 --> 02:41:52.999]  You think you're going to escape?
[02:41:53.039 --> 02:41:54.119]  INCREASE THE LEVEL!
[02:41:54.139 --> 02:42:04.303]  Well, you know what the conspiracy consciousness about that one is, is that in California now, when they reduced the Bactrimerosol, and I do say reduced, okay, it is in the trace minerals.
[02:42:04.343 --> 02:42:08.304]  And I've been following all the, and helping all the laws in all the states.
[02:42:08.672 --> 02:42:10.314]  Which they play us like fiddles, by the way.
[02:42:10.614 --> 02:42:18.581]  What they did in Illinois, for instance, and they didn't show me the bill before I went, and so therefore I couldn't alert them to it, but they put this little DOD caveat.
[02:42:18.621 --> 02:42:27.770]  You know, the DOD caveat with the BioShield bill, they have this new little thing they run with, and that is, if it's a potential emergency, not even emergency, if it's a potential emergency,
[02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:32.255]  We're allowed to inject every human being, you know, men, women, and children.
[02:42:32.275 --> 02:42:34.678]  A threat of a threat of a threat of a threat.
[02:42:34.698 --> 02:42:35.319]  That's page 7.
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:46.113]  Now in Illinois, in the Mercury Bill that passed, you know, the American Pediatric Association and the power to be, they just let us get what we want, what they think we should have.
[02:42:46.758 --> 02:42:48.579]  And what they put in there was this emergency thing.
[02:42:48.839 --> 02:43:02.168]  So in Illinois, actually prior to the passage of the bill, the Health Megaplex there actually had planned already in a memo in the meetings, had already planned to execute that clause.
[02:43:03.976 --> 02:43:06.459]  Well, I mean, the whole government's run by, quote, emergencies.
[02:43:06.479 --> 02:43:07.200]  I just want the cops listening.
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:10.705]  You know, you serve this government, you serve this system, you trust your leaders.
[02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:20.161]  Okay, don't listen to me.
[02:43:20.321 --> 02:43:21.462]  You've got a good chance.
[02:43:21.482 --> 02:43:31.529]  You give that little girl that's on the way, that little boy on the way, you go ahead and give them the shots, and then watch when they hit 18 months and it builds up to critical mass after the third round, and say bye to your son and daughter.
[02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:35.131]  And then I want you to remember, I warned you, that I was your friend.
[02:43:35.532 --> 02:43:40.555]  And I want you to know that it's your government, that's your God, that you worship, that did this to you.
[02:43:40.896 --> 02:43:45.659]  And I'm sorry, Eileen, I'll tell you, the government's doing this on purpose.
[02:43:46.139 --> 02:43:56.214]  This is all, the DU, the Mercury, it is all done because these Nazis love to hurt us and they love to hurt us into their hospitals.
[02:43:56.334 --> 02:43:57.556]  And they want to keep their job.
[02:43:59.727 --> 02:44:01.368]  They'll do anything to keep their jobs!
[02:44:01.588 --> 02:44:11.113]  Well, Aldous Huxley, who was a big globalist, wrote Brave New World, and he gave a speech in 1962 at Berkeley saying that everything he wrote in that book is what the government was planning to do.
[02:44:11.353 --> 02:44:15.815]  And in it, they would poison certain classes of children to make them dumb.
[02:44:17.516 --> 02:44:17.997]  Yep, yep.
[02:44:18.497 --> 02:44:26.725]  And you know, really putting the consciousness here that the teen screening program, the New Freedom Commission, is actually a secondary cover-up, okay?
[02:44:27.026 --> 02:44:40.159]  And that they're seeking to find these children, to isolate them, to dumb them down, and I want to just tell your audience, who probably already know, about the effect of the Ritalin, the Adderall, the Zol, the Paxil, the Zolexy, the Zyprexa, the Luvox.
[02:44:40.791 --> 02:44:43.675]  So, um, just to give you a few little, uh, examples.
[02:44:43.715 --> 02:44:47.980]  Chris Pittman, you know, age 12, was on Zoloft when he killed his grandparents and burned down their house.
[02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:57.251]  Eric Harris of the Columbine... We've never seen a mass shooting, uh, uh, Kip Kinkle, uh, the kid up in Minnesota, we've never seen one where they weren't on it.
[02:44:57.451 --> 02:44:57.892]  Exactly.
[02:44:58.172 --> 02:45:01.755]  How about that Leslie Deminuk, the one who was accused of killing her four-year-old twins?
[02:45:02.055 --> 02:45:02.996]  She had been taking Zoloft.
[02:45:03.016 --> 02:45:05.679]  What about the woman that drowned her four kids in Houston?
[02:45:05.739 --> 02:45:06.479]  Yeah, same.
[02:45:06.639 --> 02:45:09.222]  Or the woman in Fort Worth that cut the toddler's arms off?
[02:45:09.362 --> 02:45:11.063]  I've never seen it where they weren't on it!
[02:45:11.083 --> 02:45:12.524]  Well, yeah, what's up with it?
[02:45:12.925 --> 02:45:14.166]  And the thing is, this is what it does.
[02:45:14.186 --> 02:45:17.909]  When you take these drugs, people have to know what it really does, because I actually saw this happen.
[02:45:17.989 --> 02:45:21.712]  The molecule is an LSD molecule with a few other molecules added.
[02:45:21.973 --> 02:45:23.634]  It puts you into a mesmerized state.
[02:45:23.794 --> 02:45:25.476]  Exactly, and who patented the LSD?
[02:45:26.236 --> 02:45:27.177]  Who?
[02:45:27.397 --> 02:45:28.137]  C.I.A.
[02:45:28.197 --> 02:45:30.398]  Eli Lilly created that.
[02:45:30.598 --> 02:45:32.459]  Eli Lilly patented it in 1957.
[02:45:32.539 --> 02:45:34.440]  They created and patented L.S.B.
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:39.382]  It came from Abby Hoffman's wife who was doing agricultural research.
[02:45:40.542 --> 02:45:41.743]  L.S.B., yeah, right.
[02:45:42.725 --> 02:45:43.245]  Did you know that?
[02:45:43.325 --> 02:45:46.426]  By the way, I want cops to know this who are listening, because I want to convince you guys.
[02:45:46.466 --> 02:46:01.152]  I want you to go online and just type molecule of hallucinogens, and you'll see different molecules of peyote, different molecules of LSD, molecules of mescaline, psilocybin, mushrooms, and then molecule of serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil.
[02:46:01.472 --> 02:46:06.454]  And look at it, and look, it's classified as a hallucinogenic psychotropic.
[02:46:06.934 --> 02:46:09.675]  Yeah, and tell them to go to the movies, too, and see Jacob's Ladder.
[02:46:11.164 --> 02:46:12.965]  You know that movie with Tim Robbins in it?
[02:46:13.245 --> 02:46:15.226]  Yeah, they admittedly tested that stuff on the troops.
[02:46:15.626 --> 02:46:19.188]  Of course, they threw Olsen out the window.
[02:46:19.208 --> 02:46:21.189]  I mean, where does it all go?
[02:46:21.229 --> 02:46:24.371]  These people are just totally psychopathic.
[02:46:25.071 --> 02:46:27.293]  And we've got to start trusting ourselves.
[02:46:27.373 --> 02:46:29.714]  I mean, they're using our public schools now.
[02:46:29.754 --> 02:46:31.575]  This is the Teen Scream program, the New Freedom Commission.
[02:46:31.875 --> 02:46:39.341]  Are using our public schools to seek out these children and to use it as a marketing tool for big pharma.
[02:46:39.361 --> 02:46:40.922]  Well remember, that's not your opinion.
[02:46:41.022 --> 02:46:52.691]  Two years ago, two years ago, one of their execs up in Ohio got mad, had a conscience, released their own corporate minutes where they were laughing, going, we're going to go from 10% of kids on this to half.
[02:46:52.931 --> 02:46:54.272]  But now we're going to go to the adults.
[02:46:54.292 --> 02:46:59.536]  This whole thing with what's going on with this 368 that's going on now, I haven't investigated yet.
[02:46:59.596 --> 02:47:00.417]  I'm on the throes of it.
[02:47:01.157 --> 02:47:06.581]  This is a thing called American Legislative Council.
[02:47:06.742 --> 02:47:09.964]  Alex in Washington, D.C.
[02:47:10.004 --> 02:47:10.584]  A-L-E-C.
[02:47:10.705 --> 02:47:17.550]  American Legislative... Yeah, they write the main legislation template and lobby the states to pass it.
[02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:18.170]  Exactly.
[02:47:18.250 --> 02:47:19.771]  I've seen it all over the country.
[02:47:20.072 --> 02:47:23.794]  Now what you said, if you want insurance, you want anything, you've got to take all this stuff.
[02:47:23.814 --> 02:47:25.776]  It's not a law, you've just got to do it.
[02:47:25.976 --> 02:47:26.696]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:47:26.776 --> 02:47:27.876]  And they're doing the fear thing.
[02:47:27.956 --> 02:47:28.917]  It's basically fear.
[02:47:28.937 --> 02:47:30.697]  If you don't take it, you lose your health insurance coverage.
[02:47:30.957 --> 02:47:38.359]  Now, Bush said last night that we have to take self-responsibility.
[02:47:38.379 --> 02:47:40.339]  So we have to pay for everything, right?
[02:47:40.359 --> 02:47:41.380]  Social Security.
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:43.740]  We have to lose our own money.
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:50.922]  We feel a little safe that they have Social Security and that they know the players and they know Greenspan.
[02:47:50.942 --> 02:47:51.822]  They know what's going on.
[02:47:51.962 --> 02:47:55.343]  We feel safe that we're going to get some Social Security at the end of it that we don't have to worry about.
[02:47:55.703 --> 02:48:05.426]  Now they want to do the IRA thing like this, and they want to do the Social Security thing like this, and now they want to do the health thing like this, that we pay for our own health insurance, but they're going to tell us what to do.
[02:48:05.446 --> 02:48:06.947]  You're going to pay for your own health insurance?
[02:48:06.967 --> 02:48:08.147]  You're going to take responsibility?
[02:48:08.447 --> 02:48:11.948]  Yes, but you can't choose what kind of health care system you want.
[02:48:11.988 --> 02:48:12.648]  You can't choose.
[02:48:12.708 --> 02:48:14.009]  No, no, it's pure fascism.
[02:48:14.049 --> 02:48:18.250]  It's just like giving Halliburton the camps.
[02:48:18.330 --> 02:48:20.711]  They just say, you're going to do this.
[02:48:21.091 --> 02:48:22.492]  That's about the quarantining, huh?
[02:48:22.532 --> 02:48:23.412]  Of the pandemic flu?
[02:48:24.890 --> 02:48:26.192]  They're just saying we're building camps.
[02:48:26.512 --> 02:48:27.153]  Doing it for what?
[02:48:27.894 --> 02:48:28.675]  Just because we love you.
[02:48:28.695 --> 02:48:30.356]  We're the government and we're building camps right now.
[02:48:30.397 --> 02:48:31.097]  Everything's fine.
[02:48:31.758 --> 02:48:33.040]  I'll try to make it to you any minute.
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:35.422]  But that's what privatization is.
[02:48:36.584 --> 02:48:38.346]  We're going to tell you what to do with your money.
[02:48:38.366 --> 02:48:39.587]  You're going to give it to our cronies.
[02:48:40.047 --> 02:48:41.609]  They're all a bunch of crooks like Abramoff.
[02:48:41.629 --> 02:48:42.751]  They're just a bunch of crooks.
[02:48:42.951 --> 02:48:44.633]  A bunch of dirty, murdering crooks.
[02:48:47.156 --> 02:48:49.998]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.258 --> 02:48:51.839]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.179 --> 02:48:56.862]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.203 --> 02:49:03.947]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:06.248]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.448 --> 02:49:09.289]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.389 --> 02:49:14.050]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.250 --> 02:49:18.651]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.891 --> 02:49:26.094]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.374 --> 02:49:28.794]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.955 --> 02:49:30.535]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:49:31.296 --> 02:49:36.864]  Call 1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[02:49:36.924 --> 02:49:37.865]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:38.046 --> 02:49:40.269]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:46.181 --> 02:49:53.704]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:53.964 --> 02:50:04.889]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.370 --> 02:50:10.551]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:10.871 --> 02:50:21.316]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:21.636 --> 02:50:22.136]  That's right!
[02:50:22.316 --> 02:50:29.418]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:29.718 --> 02:50:33.840]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.461]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:38.501 --> 02:50:38.961]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:48.400]  I think so.
[02:51:03.505 --> 02:51:03.885]  I think so.
[02:51:23.677 --> 02:51:26.578]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.105 --> 02:51:55.206]  I'm totally overwhelmed here.
[02:51:55.226 --> 02:51:58.489]  I've got all these emails and instant messages coming in by the hundreds.
[02:51:58.549 --> 02:52:02.132]  I've got Eileen Dannemann here.
[02:52:02.172 --> 02:52:03.893]  I want to get back on the show sometime.
[02:52:04.013 --> 02:52:07.216]  I promise I'll go to these two final calls from Bertrand and Evelyn.
[02:52:07.256 --> 02:52:08.237]  I just want to go to you.
[02:52:09.338 --> 02:52:15.443]  Eileen, I've got to get you back up in the future because we're both frantic on air and everything you're talking about is documented.
[02:52:15.483 --> 02:52:16.624]  I'm finishing your sentences.
[02:52:16.644 --> 02:52:17.525]  You're finishing mine.
[02:52:18.405 --> 02:52:19.266]  We've never talked before.
[02:52:19.326 --> 02:52:21.047]  It's because this is what's really going on.
[02:52:21.427 --> 02:52:22.627]  It is diabolical.
[02:52:23.268 --> 02:52:27.009]  In closing, any other key things real fast we need to be aware of?
[02:52:27.049 --> 02:52:29.451]  No, you're covering the whole nine yards.
[02:52:29.511 --> 02:52:33.052]  Have people go to my website for the documentation, ProgressiveConvergence.com.
[02:52:33.112 --> 02:52:36.214]  And if you haven't had Ken Kramer on from the psych search, you should.
[02:52:36.234 --> 02:52:37.634]  That's a teen screen thing.
[02:52:37.754 --> 02:52:39.055]  And you're covering all the bases.
[02:52:39.095 --> 02:52:39.835]  And thank you so much.
[02:52:40.256 --> 02:52:42.297]  Thank you for coming on and God bless and God speed.
[02:52:42.317 --> 02:52:42.697]  Take care.
[02:52:43.664 --> 02:52:44.184]  You bet.
[02:52:44.204 --> 02:52:45.104]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:52:45.124 --> 02:52:47.085]  All right, Bertrand in Canada.
[02:52:47.105 --> 02:52:47.645]  You're on the air.
[02:52:47.705 --> 02:52:48.145]  Go ahead.
[02:52:49.045 --> 02:52:49.726]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:50.666 --> 02:52:52.306]  Alex, it's a privilege.
[02:52:52.786 --> 02:52:54.407]  Oh, please dispense with that.
[02:52:54.467 --> 02:52:55.967]  I mean, I'm honored that you called us.
[02:52:56.007 --> 02:52:56.387]  Go ahead.
[02:52:56.407 --> 02:53:02.429]  Yeah, I would just like to say a couple of things here and get your opinion.
[02:53:04.169 --> 02:53:06.950]  You said earlier in the show that you like to study history, right?
[02:53:07.725 --> 02:53:08.305]  Somewhat, yes.
[02:53:08.365 --> 02:53:11.647]  I mean, it's so big, nobody can know all the history, but I know just a little bit.
[02:53:12.028 --> 02:53:21.953]  Well, you know, I really respect your work, but I personally believe that there's a big piece of the puzzle that you just haven't figured out yet.
[02:53:22.093 --> 02:53:30.058]  But anyways, I really highly recommend you read a book by an American historian by the name of Leo H. Lehman, I believe I'm pronouncing it right.
[02:53:30.078 --> 02:53:31.299]  The book was published in 1942.
[02:53:31.379 --> 02:53:35.061]  It's entitled, Behind the Dictators.
[02:53:36.574 --> 02:53:37.816]  I think I've heard of that book.
[02:53:38.436 --> 02:53:43.382]  Yeah, you need to read that because it makes a connection that I just don't think you've figured out yet.
[02:53:44.823 --> 02:53:48.387]  I'd just like to ask you a couple of questions real fast before you hang up on me.
[02:53:51.417 --> 02:54:02.184]  You believe that the suppressed historical evidence that the Vatican is responsible for... You know, I said first callers today, and you used a fake name.
[02:54:02.304 --> 02:54:03.705]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:04.465 --> 02:54:06.507]  You called, what was it, Friday or was it yesterday?
[02:54:06.927 --> 02:54:07.848]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:54:07.888 --> 02:54:10.689]  I don't understand why we can't let new callers call.
[02:54:10.729 --> 02:54:11.410]  That's not fair.
[02:54:12.482 --> 02:54:16.106]  You know, I don't scream what you can say on the show, but it gets old, sir.
[02:54:17.086 --> 02:54:18.027]  Let's talk to Evelyn.
[02:54:18.508 --> 02:54:20.549]  Evelyn, you're our last caller from South Carolina.
[02:54:20.589 --> 02:54:21.030]  Go ahead.
[02:54:21.430 --> 02:54:22.031]  Praise the Lord.
[02:54:22.791 --> 02:54:24.513]  Do you come on the radio in South Carolina?
[02:54:25.414 --> 02:54:27.295]  I do not have an affiliate in South Carolina.
[02:54:27.315 --> 02:54:28.776]  You have to listen on the internet or shortwave.
[02:54:29.057 --> 02:54:34.241]  Okay, but I've got four tapes that someone gave me, but then they called and wanted back as much.
[02:54:34.261 --> 02:54:35.182]  I'm going to have to order some more.
[02:54:35.746 --> 02:54:37.647]  And I'm putting the message out because this is the warning.
[02:54:37.667 --> 02:54:39.148]  We've got to warn just like Noah did.
[02:54:39.428 --> 02:54:40.989]  If they don't believe, we've still got to warn.
[02:54:41.309 --> 02:54:45.131]  And we cannot be afraid just like Daniel wasn't afraid to do what he believed in doing.
[02:54:45.171 --> 02:54:46.411]  We have to stand for the truth.
[02:54:46.991 --> 02:54:48.032]  And that's what I want to say.
[02:54:48.272 --> 02:54:54.015]  And I want you to help me to help warn the people, because I can't afford to pay all this money for all this stuff, you know.
[02:54:54.255 --> 02:54:58.897]  But I've got to get it out, and I'm getting some of it out now, these four videos, and I'm putting them on DVDs in a number of places.
[02:54:59.277 --> 02:54:59.517]  Good!
[02:54:59.537 --> 02:54:59.637]  Good!
[02:54:59.657 --> 02:55:03.139]  Well, you know, join with... I'm going to have to get them tomorrow, so now I've got to get them more.
[02:55:03.159 --> 02:55:04.960]  So, the day I call your place,
[02:55:05.627 --> 02:55:09.432]  Um, and they have four on the blowout, blowout special.
[02:55:09.912 --> 02:55:14.358]  American dictator, and uh, martial law, dark secret, etc, etc.
[02:55:14.718 --> 02:55:17.822]  So I'm going to be putting the money order in because I don't believe in this system.
[02:55:17.842 --> 02:55:18.823]  This system is not right.
[02:55:19.104 --> 02:55:23.409]  I'm politically incorrect, but I'm politically correct just like Noah was, and you are too.
[02:55:24.039 --> 02:55:28.963]  I hear you ma'am, and it's good to have you on board with us from South Carolina, Evelyn.
[02:55:29.764 --> 02:55:33.447]  Listen, we let people make copies of the videos for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:55:34.007 --> 02:55:35.929]  I also let you download it all up the website.
[02:55:35.949 --> 02:55:36.890]  A lot of it's there for free.
[02:55:36.930 --> 02:55:41.494]  We can't give it all away for free, and I'm honored that you're going to buy them and support us.
[02:55:42.054 --> 02:55:44.516]  But frankly, if I saw you on the street, I'd just give you the videos.
[02:55:44.956 --> 02:55:46.497]  But join with a few of your friends.
[02:55:46.537 --> 02:55:49.420]  You guys get together and say, just get Martial Law, one video.
[02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:51.201]  And then make copies of that.
[02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:55.304]  If people like you, Evelyn, stand up, the New World Order doesn't have a prayer.
[02:55:55.704 --> 02:55:56.165]  Take care.
[02:55:56.225 --> 02:55:56.885]  Good hearing from you.
[02:55:56.905 --> 02:55:58.186]  I'm sorry that we're out of time.
[02:55:59.247 --> 02:56:03.310]  And as for the caller before, Bertrand, with the fake name,
[02:56:04.510 --> 02:56:07.693]  You know, when I say first-time callers or people who haven't called in a while, I mean it.
[02:56:07.753 --> 02:56:12.156]  Because people who are first-time callers never get a chance to call in because some people try to monopolize that.
[02:56:12.176 --> 02:56:17.099]  I'd be more than happy to battle it out with you about who the real boogeyman is in the New World Order.
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:21.202]  But you need to call on the days when we have open lines.
[02:56:21.762 --> 02:56:23.363]  Alright, back to 9-9 at midnight.
[02:56:23.624 --> 02:56:25.085]  God bless you all.
[02:56:26.125 --> 02:56:30.348]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
