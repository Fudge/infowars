[00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.408]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:08.154]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:09.939]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:11.424]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:12.989]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.042]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:35.629]  Boy, I tell ya, this year is just hurtling past us, and I guess we're hurtling along with Father Time.
[00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.230]  Already Wednesday, the 24th day of May, 2006.
[00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.311]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:48.538]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast and get into masses of vital news and information.
[00:00:48.558 --> 00:01:05.130]  We also have an author joining us to talk about where all that Nazi capital went, the looted capital of Europe, where it went after World War II and Nazi influences in our culture today and some of the stay-behind networks the Nazis left in this country, i.e.
[00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.250]  the Bush family.
[00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:09.893]  So that is coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:12.775]  We will have open phones, as I said, throughout the broadcast.
[00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:23.728]  I promised you yesterday that we would have a detailed report about the documented evidence that FEMA in 13,000 plus counties, almost every U.S.
[00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:24.109]  county,
[00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:40.432]  Is brainwashing and conditioning and swearing in basically hiring the pastors in your town to covertly preach from the pulpit to never question the government, to turn your guns in, to go into quarantine, to go into relocation camps.
[00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:45.995]  We've got a bunch of the training manuals and internal training manuals up on the website that one of them is like
[00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.920]  I don't know, 30-something pages long.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.743]  We're busy scanning that in right now to add it to the article that Paul Watson has written.
[00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:54.724]  Talk about burning the candle with both ends.
[00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:55.865]  He did a great job yesterday.
[00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.527]  I think he wrote three articles, updated the site, and he's working on a book.
[00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:00.808]  At the same time, he knows the time is short.
[00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:02.529]  The globalists know the time is short.
[00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.331]  We are fighting them at point-blank range here in the Info War.
[00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:08.153]  That's up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:09.514]  More details on that today.
[00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:21.222]  It's up to you now, the listeners, to go get the article, to email it to everyone, to print it off with the documents, to put a folder together, to take it to your pastor, and say, are you part of this program?
[00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.203]  Are you involved in this?
[00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:24.464]  Have you signed up for this?
[00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.988]  Are you preaching what the government tells you to preach?
[00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:31.251]  I mean, this is so un-American from every angle.
[00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:34.094]  It is so clearly authoritarian.
[00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:35.755]  It is so clearly despotic.
[00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:42.101]  It is so clearly a serious signpost on the road to total and complete tyranny.
[00:02:42.502 --> 00:02:45.665]  I just can't even describe with words how textbook
[00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.994]  Dictatorship, textbook Soviet Nazi block this is.
[00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:55.516]  I'm just speechless, but it's par for the course in the new America.
[00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:58.437]  Vicente Fox is up in Utah.
[00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:02.758]  The Utah leaders are calling for total open borders and the end of sovereignty.
[00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:06.799]  Lou Dobbs admits it's part of the Oslo Plan to get rid of the United States.
[00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.520]  Yes, now even Lou Dobbs has covered it.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.301]  His ratings will only continue to explode to number one, of course.
[00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:15.722]  Number one in his time slot right now because he tells a little bit of the truth.
[00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.811]  You see, people want the truth.
[00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:21.734]  This is not that radical of a broadcast.
[00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:24.617]  We just cover the facts.
[00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:28.341]  I'm sorry, the facts are they're building FEMA camps for all of us.
[00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:34.567]  The facts are they're training the BATF to confiscate guns nationwide with local Tattletail squads and the police.
[00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:39.933]  The truth is we have a corrupt, criminally insane elite running things.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.941]  Also coming up, some really good news here.
[00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:50.403]  One of the inventors of the net headline, Web Inventor Warns of Dark Net, and No, It's Not Al Gore.
[00:03:51.183 --> 00:03:57.145]  The web should remain neutral and resist attempts to fragment it into different services.
[00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:03.047]  Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee has said, we're going to try to get him on,
[00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:12.169]  Recent attempts in the US to try to change from different levels of online access web were not part of the internet model he said in Edinburgh.
[00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.889]  Now for those that don't know this is BBC.
[00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.391]  The net within a year and a half could be completely shut down.
[00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:29.354]  Now you can ignore me like most people in mainstream do and then later pull your hair out and scream that I was right or you can fight this now.
[00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.342]  They are already doing it.
[00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:32.903]  Okay?
[00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:34.823]  And I keep saying I want to get into more details on this.
[00:04:34.863 --> 00:04:35.743]  We'll do that after the break.
[00:04:36.303 --> 00:04:38.344]  We'll get into all the new Iran information.
[00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:41.885]  The internet is about to die.
[00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:43.845]  The gun is to its head.
[00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:47.966]  The hammer is cocked.
[00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:50.347]  The finger is tightening on the trigger.
[00:04:52.287 --> 00:04:53.147]  I'm not joking.
[00:04:54.768 --> 00:04:58.309]  You will not be able to access my websites very soon.
[00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.649]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:05.393]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:07.214]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:12.237]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:19.302]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:21.604]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:24.647]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:29.411]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.631 --> 00:05:34.015]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:41.482]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.164]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:05.159]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.921]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.962]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:19.344]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:27.647]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:33.431]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:37.354]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:39.556]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:39.636 --> 00:06:41.798]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:42.038 --> 00:06:46.981]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:52.746]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:59.792]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:07:00.793 --> 00:07:02.634]  Gas prices are out of control.
[00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:07.038]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.923]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[00:07:12.103 --> 00:07:16.527]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using
[00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:17.027]  I think so.
[00:07:36.153 --> 00:07:36.814]  I think so.
[00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:10.117]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:11.598]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:13.219]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.823]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:22.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:31.213]  We have the author of Nazi Hydra in America joining us in the next hour.
[00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:39.466]  Nazis stay behind networks and capital in the Western world, predominantly in the United States after World War II.
[00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:40.227]  That's coming up.
[00:08:41.007 --> 00:08:42.187]  I want to get into Iran.
[00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:47.050]  Sources are reporting that Iran believes Israel to strike within the year.
[00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.271]  Tehran planning retaliation against U.S.
[00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:50.331]  and British interest.
[00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:52.412]  We'll get into that report.
[00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:56.734]  Iranian President promises historic slap to ending attacker.
[00:08:57.214 --> 00:08:58.535]  I say, how dare him!
[00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:07.690]  If 200 plus sites are bombed, including with many nukes, I say they lay there and thank us for it and send us flowers.
[00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.310]  If they don't, they're evil.
[00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.691]  Can you imagine someone saying they'll fight back if they're attacked?
[00:09:12.731 --> 00:09:15.772]  These people are the scum of the earth.
[00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.253]  It's unbelievable.
[00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:20.253]  They are so bad.
[00:09:20.273 --> 00:09:26.955]  And they don't run white slavery kidnapping rings like the Israelis, the Saudis, the Turks, all of our best allies.
[00:09:27.395 --> 00:09:28.515]  That's why they're bad too.
[00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:31.659]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:40.642]  Iran's certainly not perfect, but compared to our allies in Egypt and other places, Saudi Arabia, Israel, they are as pure as the driven snow.
[00:09:42.062 --> 00:09:43.042]  We'll get into that later.
[00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:54.006]  Also, we have a big report out about how preachers in 13,000 plus counties all over the country have been secretly signed on to FEMA to then give dissertations during their
[00:09:55.234 --> 00:10:07.032]  During their Sunday and Wednesday services to tell their flock to turn their guns in, to submit to FEMA, to go into the camps, to turn... I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:10:07.072 --> 00:10:09.015]  We'll be getting into that report.
[00:10:09.055 --> 00:10:10.757]  We have the documents as well.
[00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:19.265]  There was a big fear-mongering operation yesterday about how there was human-to-human transmission in Indonesia.
[00:10:19.305 --> 00:10:20.326]  We were all dead.
[00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.949]  Only martial law would keep us safe.
[00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:31.358]  And within hours of that report, don't worry, the scientists that reported this will get big world health organization funding now, like they always do for these hoaxes.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.801]  But it helps heighten all the fear.
[00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:45.009]  Within just a few hours, it was reported that they tested the individuals, and indeed, it's not human-to-human transmission of the vaunted, the deadly, the dastardly bird flu.
[00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:54.555]  Of course, almost all flus on the planet that humans are able to contract actually comes from birds to begin with, and Asia is the main breeding ground for this.
[00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:59.098]  But now, for time immemorial, we'll endlessly be in fear of the wicked bird flu.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.820]  This is Reuters.
[00:11:01.301 --> 00:11:03.962]  No sign of bird flu mutation in Indonesia case.
[00:11:04.422 --> 00:11:14.266]  World Health Organization says limited human-to-human transmission of bird flu might have occurred in an Indonesian family, but there is no evidence the virus has mutated to allow it to pass easily among people.
[00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:22.530]  The World Health Organization said fears of human-to-human transmission pushed down European shares and boosted demand for safe haven bonds.
[00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:28.813]  On Wednesday, Lifting Benchmark booned futures to their highest in more than six weeks.
[00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:30.954]  The dollar rose against the yen.
[00:11:31.014 --> 00:11:32.556]  Oh, the dollar finally rose a little.
[00:11:33.036 --> 00:11:40.402]  Concerns have been growing about the case in North Sumatra, in which seven family members from a village died this month.
[00:11:40.422 --> 00:11:43.224]  The case is the largest family cluster known to date.
[00:11:43.524 --> 00:11:45.846]  The World Health Organization reported.
[00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:52.891]  And then I have other reports here about how they quarantined thousands, and we'll be getting into that as well.
[00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:54.052]  But before I go any further,
[00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.254]  Let me just read to you a few paragraphs from the BBC today.
[00:11:59.274 --> 00:12:02.997]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:06.340]  Web Inventor Warns of Dark Net.
[00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:08.182]  That's the headline.
[00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:17.920]  The normal customary headline, I've literally seen it probably, I don't know, 15, 20 times in the last three years, is the Internet is dead, the net is dead, the web is dead.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:25.946]  Just type that into Google and you'll read them, chortling and having little victory celebrations at the Internet2 meeting, what, three years ago in Austin?
[00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:30.389]  No, three years ago in England, two years ago in Austin, and then I think it was in Chicago last year.
[00:12:31.756 --> 00:12:48.488]  And they say we're going to shut the web down and the CEOs actually get up and say we're going to force everyone to only use our systems and they're going to pay hundreds of dollars a month just to get on the web and we'll be able to block out most of the internet and only send people to the establishment sites.
[00:12:48.528 --> 00:12:51.451]  This is the official stated plan with the U.S.
[00:12:51.511 --> 00:12:52.531]  government setting it up.
[00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:54.593]  Of course the U.S.
[00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:58.896]  and British and European governments developed it as the ARPANET, the DARPANET back in the 60s, 70s and 80s.
[00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:03.877]  No one person can say they invented it.
[00:13:04.237 --> 00:13:11.368]  Al Gore in the early 90's as a Senator, right before he got elected Vice President in what, 1993?
[00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:20.403]  Did help put through funding that opened it up to the general public on a wider scale.
[00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:28.211]  Before it was kind of, I guess, the VBS systems, kind of the web posting systems, which I never even got into or knew how to use.
[00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:32.495]  I remember people like my father and others who were on it, you know, back in the early 1990s and even before.
[00:13:35.345 --> 00:13:45.372]  But the gentleman who is speaking out, if anybody can be called the father of the Internet, he really is the individual who set up the modern architecture that we all use today.
[00:13:45.452 --> 00:13:51.317]  So you can certainly call him one of the chief progenitors of the Internet.
[00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:55.220]  Web inventor warns of dark net.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.604]  The web should remain neutral and resist attempts to fragment it into different services.
[00:14:01.824 --> 00:14:03.886]  Web inventor, Sir Tim
[00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:12.691]  Burns Lee has said, or Sir Tim Berners Lee has said, recent attempts in the U.S.
[00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:22.495]  to try to change for different levels, or charge for different levels, of online access web were not part of the internet model, he said in Edinburgh.
[00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:25.276]  He warned that if the U.S.
[00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:30.759]  decided to go ahead with the two-tier internet, or Internet2 network, would enter a dark period.
[00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:35.469]  Sir Tim was speaking at the start of a conference on the future of the web.
[00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:40.354]  What's very important from my point of view is that there is one web, he said.
[00:14:40.774 --> 00:14:45.739]  Anyone that tries to chop it into two will find that their piece looks very boring.
[00:14:46.568 --> 00:14:47.849]  An equal net, he said.
[00:14:47.869 --> 00:14:53.814]  The British scientist developed the web in 89 as an academic tool to allow scientists to share data.
[00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:57.136]  Since then, it has exploded into every area of life.
[00:14:57.436 --> 00:15:02.820]  However, as it has begun to grow, there have been increasingly diverse opinions on how it should evolve.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.943]  That is, global corporate crime interests are openly taking it over and saying they are.
[00:15:07.504 --> 00:15:14.749]  The World Wide Web Consortium, of which Sir Tim is the director, believes in an open model, or internet neutrality.
[00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:15.830]  We'll break that down in a moment.
[00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:27.345]  This is based on the concept of network neutrality, where everyone has the same level of access to the web, and that all data moving around the web is treated equally.
[00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:39.688]  Now to explain that, remember about, I don't know, six, seven months ago, about 40% of people on the web for two weeks couldn't get to InfoWars.com and thousands of other sites?
[00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:44.029]  That was because Level 2 and Cogent, two big peer-to-peer
[00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:53.753]  Just command-and-control hubs, to boil it down to layman's terms, decided to have a war with each other.
[00:15:54.974 --> 00:16:06.599]  And one of the companies simply shut off its feeds to Cogent, and the two were supposed to send traffic back and forth across to each other, peer-to-peer.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.721]  This is very similar to what the Spanish are doing in Texas.
[00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:12.402]  The Spanish government's backed Centra.
[00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:19.476]  They have paid off the politicians and are openly seizing control by fiat of 8,000 miles of roads.
[00:16:19.496 --> 00:16:29.518]  That's the majority of the roads in Texas and they're going to place a $3 a gallon, that's what it equals out to, a gallon tax on all mobility.
[00:16:29.998 --> 00:16:40.181]  That's what they say it's going to start at and it's now beginning and the corresponding laws are traveling through the legislature right now to put transponders and all inspection stickers and taxes via wireless systems.
[00:16:40.681 --> 00:16:42.041]  The internet are roads.
[00:16:43.012 --> 00:16:56.977]  And it's the equivalent of every time you get to a city or to a mix master, to an exchange, there is a massive toll road set up that's going to charge you, say, $15, as they do in some areas of the East.
[00:16:56.997 --> 00:16:57.457]  $10 to even $15.
[00:16:57.777 --> 00:17:03.539]  Now they've raised some of the tolls to go across bridges and through tunnels from $8 to $12 to even $15 in some cases.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.680]  So it's very similar.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.501]  They just seize control of these hubs
[00:17:08.101 --> 00:17:20.072]  And then they just say, sorry, we're only going to give preferential treatment to Time Warner, ABC, Cap Cities, Fox, all of these groups.
[00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:23.495]  And when you go read what Internet2 is saying, this is what they're doing.
[00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:29.701]  Forty corporations, and it was fifty, and now I'm told they've expanded it.
[00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:39.049]  Academic institutions, that's how the government conduits tens of billions of dollars through those institutions, and the universities build the hubs, and it's basically given to the corporations.
[00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.033]  And they say, don't worry, on internet too, it'll be like MySpace.
[00:17:43.053 --> 00:17:46.936]  That's why we wrote the article, MySpace Trojan Horse for taking over the net.
[00:17:48.137 --> 00:17:51.360]  That did get picked up, by the way, by Time Magazine and even the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.143]  That's how good that article was that Paul and I put out.
[00:17:54.804 --> 00:18:02.469]  I'm proud of our research, but they even had to quote us and had to respond and say, wow, this is really true because of you, the listeners, getting that article and getting it out.
[00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:03.930]  It really woke up a lot of people.
[00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:04.490]  I'm proud of that.
[00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.011]  But again, I digress.
[00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:08.773]  Let me get back to what I was going to cover here.
[00:18:10.314 --> 00:18:19.840]  What happens is, is as the traffic goes down the web, they're going to say, well, you get to have, say, Time Warner slash InfoWars slash Com or whatever.
[00:18:20.988 --> 00:18:25.673]  And then you sign an agreement to be on their platform and their advertising is on it.
[00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:34.162]  They have keyword robots and spiders, that's what those programs are called, that block out certain postings, certain videos, certain statements, just like China has.
[00:18:34.663 --> 00:18:37.486]  Just like Google and Yahoo and others have done in China with their government.
[00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:40.148]  Understand, this is not my opinion.
[00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:41.590]  They're saying this.
[00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:43.552]  And they're saying that
[00:18:44.697 --> 00:18:46.019]  No more net video.
[00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:48.061]  No more email for free.
[00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:50.924]  And again, you pay for that with your web subscription.
[00:18:50.944 --> 00:18:55.549]  You pay $60, $70 a month for cable, cable modem.
[00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:59.513]  You pay $35 or $50 depending on where you are for DSL.
[00:18:59.794 --> 00:19:01.335]  You pay $10 for dial-up.
[00:19:01.756 --> 00:19:02.236]  Uh-uh!
[00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:03.798]  You see, that pays for it.
[00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:06.421]  The net has held up the telecommunications industry.
[00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:15.684]  The net has been the only thing in our economy still operating since the dot-com bust, and now the net is bigger financially than it was before the bust of 2000-2001.
[00:19:16.344 --> 00:19:18.185]  So we're paying our way.
[00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:22.206]  By the net remaining free, we mean the flow of information.
[00:19:23.006 --> 00:19:32.829]  And so they're going to go in and build dams everywhere they are, and they're going to literally, and they said this five years ago, I remember first reading this in industry documents, they're going to shut down
[00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:37.453]  All the major switching hubs, not upgrade them, shut them down.
[00:19:37.493 --> 00:19:38.153]  This is official.
[00:19:38.973 --> 00:19:39.814]  I want to keep repeating that.
[00:19:39.854 --> 00:19:40.754]  This is official.
[00:19:41.434 --> 00:19:53.079]  And the net just will not be there, and then, oh, you can come pay, we're talking about $80 to $100 to begin with, for this new premium net, and then you'll get your video and your free email and everything else, but it won't be free.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.382]  And how many of you will pay $100 to be able to go to InfoWars.com?
[00:19:58.422 --> 00:19:59.042]  Now you understand.
[00:20:02.037 --> 00:20:03.658]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:20:03.778 --> 00:20:07.920]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.902]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:17.705]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:20.887]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:23.468]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:28.251]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:20:28.251 --> 00:20:28.991]  We're good to go!
[00:20:53.301 --> 00:20:55.283]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:56.464]  One and the same.
[00:20:56.624 --> 00:21:07.672]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.638 --> 00:21:24.760]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.861]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:29.942]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.483 --> 00:21:32.704]  Here is reality.
[00:21:33.064 --> 00:21:36.646]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:40.808]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:43.949]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:49.274]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:49.614 --> 00:21:50.796]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:51.036]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.785 --> 00:22:05.307]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.847 --> 00:22:11.150]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:18.015]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:21.497]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:22:22.117 --> 00:22:33.327]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:47.273]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:48.354 --> 00:22:52.536]  And request your free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:53.236]  Call now.
[00:22:53.396 --> 00:22:56.238]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:01.954 --> 00:23:07.923]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:16.493 --> 00:23:16.793]  We're good.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.060]  This is from the BBC concerning Internet 2.
[00:24:14.924 --> 00:24:18.125]  They come right out and admit that you will have to pay.
[00:24:18.566 --> 00:24:24.228]  It says the two-tier system would mean that people would only have full access to those portions of the Internet that they pay for.
[00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:25.348]  You'd have to select those.
[00:24:25.368 --> 00:24:28.429]  You'd never even be able to discover the entire Internet.
[00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.031]  And that some companies would be given priority over others.
[00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:44.356]  And then again, you have to sign agreements waiving your free speech rights when you sign up to be on the mainline Internet that the general public is actually even able to access.
[00:24:45.416 --> 00:24:47.557]  This is so unbelievable.
[00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:52.519]  The government built the net, they designed the net, they handed it over to industry.
[00:24:53.279 --> 00:25:05.244]  Do you think the New World Order likes it that when you type 9-11-9-slash-1-1-1 into a search engine that all of the first links that come up are the government did it, the government was involved, here's all the evidence?
[00:25:05.864 --> 00:25:08.005]  Do you like the fact that you type globalism in?
[00:25:08.989 --> 00:25:12.430]  And the first links that come up are exposing the New World Order.
[00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:17.891]  Folks that aren't savvy to this, that means that's what's getting the most traffic.
[00:25:18.991 --> 00:25:34.715]  In fact, what the media calls conspiracy, what we call alternative real news, is now on the verge of surpassing pornography that for the last ten years has been the most dominant type of content on the Internet.
[00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.033]  We are currently number two, about to be number one.
[00:25:39.214 --> 00:25:45.039]  Every day hundreds of new Patriot truth-telling websites go up globally.
[00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:48.542]  The establishment cannot allow this to happen.
[00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:56.950]  Last year we learned from Jim Tucker and Daniel Estalon and others that got documents out of Bilderberg from some of the employees and others.
[00:25:57.771 --> 00:26:03.214]  We're working inside was they're very upset about the internet and want to tax it and regulate it.
[00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:11.800]  They're talking about a penny an email that will kill email internet list, that will kill Yahoo list, that will kill that out of hand.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.062]  They're attacking every baseline of the web now.
[00:26:16.122 --> 00:26:18.824]  Notice how the media, mainstream media, constantly demonizes it.
[00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:20.745]  Talks about how dangerous it is.
[00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:22.166]  Talks about how dangerous it is to
[00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:23.586]  Spend money on it.
[00:26:23.626 --> 00:26:25.687]  Talks about how it needs to be regulated.
[00:26:25.947 --> 00:26:30.248]  But statistically, you look at the facts, it isn't the Internet that's doing this.
[00:26:30.668 --> 00:26:33.368]  It's the government selling data to private corporations.
[00:26:33.428 --> 00:26:35.989]  Bank of America losing 3 million customers.
[00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:38.909]  26 million vets having their data stolen.
[00:26:39.469 --> 00:26:45.450]  All of that is happening via employees and corrupt individuals and hackers going directly into systems.
[00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:47.891]  It is much safer to buy something
[00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:49.692]  This is in the news.
[00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:56.975]  If you go read the industry publications, it's much safer to buy things off the web than it is to give somebody your credit card at a gas station.
[00:26:57.015 --> 00:27:06.599]  You know, somebody from Bangladesh who then makes a copy of your card number, faxes it to Bangladesh, and his brother then goes to, you know, stealing your bank account.
[00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:08.319]  That is the majority of it.
[00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:11.461]  But again, the mainstream media won't tell you that.
[00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:17.243]  They're setting the net up for a fall, and they're openly announcing that they're going to do it.
[00:27:18.835 --> 00:27:20.578]  It is so dastardly.
[00:27:20.878 --> 00:27:21.980]  But they have to do it.
[00:27:22.761 --> 00:27:24.043]  They have to attempt to do it.
[00:27:24.103 --> 00:27:30.252]  The good news is the internet is so wildly popular and getting more popular by the day.
[00:27:32.052 --> 00:27:54.847]  And the old line media, I mean, when newspaper circulation is down the last, what, 9 years by 60 plus percent on average, TV viewership down by over 40 percent in the last 5 years, when they're losing all credibility, when new start-up, alternative news websites become bigger than major papers in just 12 months, and we see this happening every year now,
[00:27:55.567 --> 00:28:15.200]  They have to come in and regulate and try to shut it down, but the good news is there is such a force of people that now have a hunger for alternative information and the truth that they're going to try to shut it down and try to restrict it and they're going to have some success, but even the inventor of the internet in this BBC article says they will fail.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.544]  The people, by their sheer mass, will knock down the firewalls, will knock down the gates,
[00:28:21.964 --> 00:28:23.866]  We'll get the alternative information.
[00:28:23.906 --> 00:28:27.050]  In fact, when they try to restrict it, that'll make it even hotter.
[00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:32.035]  So understand, you need to appreciate alternative information.
[00:28:32.055 --> 00:28:33.336]  This didn't come to you easy.
[00:28:33.396 --> 00:28:34.157]  This is hard.
[00:28:34.177 --> 00:28:41.184]  A lot of blood, sweat, and tears, and research, and danger that we have put ourselves into bringing you this.
[00:28:41.384 --> 00:28:42.906]  Please appreciate.
[00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:53.077]  The information you get at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net
[00:28:54.255 --> 00:28:59.017]  Please appreciate it and know that it is in grave danger.
[00:28:59.417 --> 00:29:02.378]  It is hurting the globalists grievously.
[00:29:02.798 --> 00:29:04.019]  They are in trouble.
[00:29:04.499 --> 00:29:06.380]  They are launching attacks on it now.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:13.662]  I don't like to give them attention, but we have certified official government attacks weekly.
[00:29:14.302 --> 00:29:15.963]  Unbelievable stuff goes on.
[00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:20.885]  Unbelievable amounts of money have to be spent to counter man-ness and block it.
[00:29:21.105 --> 00:29:22.065]  But we don't care.
[00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:23.526]  We see that
[00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:28.007]  As a sign and a signal of our effectiveness.
[00:29:28.047 --> 00:29:31.130]  And of course, they're just probing and testing their own systems right now.
[00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.033]  They can out of hand shut us down any time they want, but it'll be too obvious.
[00:29:35.354 --> 00:29:42.380]  They have to do it through foils, through screens, through fencers, through these other operatives, but they will fail.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:49.306]  And as the globalists try to shut the web down, it's going to rally people to fight for it, and that's a wake-up call in and of itself.
[00:29:49.606 --> 00:29:50.807]  Stay with us, more news right ahead.
[00:29:51.781 --> 00:29:54.864]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.705 --> 00:29:58.488]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:10.220]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.262]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:13.603]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.973 --> 00:30:20.058]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:30:20.338 --> 00:30:24.000]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:31:01.832 --> 00:31:08.055]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.215 --> 00:31:14.358]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.658 --> 00:31:23.102]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.323 --> 00:31:30.346]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.666 --> 00:31:35.489]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.709 --> 00:31:41.113]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.453 --> 00:31:44.515]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.856 --> 00:31:52.761]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.952]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[00:32:13.273 --> 00:32:20.916]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.217 --> 00:32:28.080]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.661]  There are no side effects!

[00:32:58.254 --> 00:33:16.068]  Bob, we're going to get into some of your calls coming up later in this segment also.
[00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:21.469]  What's happening with Iran, the saber-rattling really intensifying right now.
[00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:26.435]  More on the latest bird flu hysteria and hoaxing that's going on.
[00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:28.377]  We'll be covering it all.
[00:33:28.817 --> 00:33:34.123]  Just want to remind you we've got a big 9-11 conference exposing that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:33:35.104 --> 00:33:41.727]  The biggest of its kind coming up in downtown Los Angeles at the Sheraton on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:33:41.767 --> 00:33:44.788]  Get your tickets now before they're gone.
[00:33:44.848 --> 00:33:48.110]  We're exactly a month away from this kicking off now.
[00:33:49.073 --> 00:33:51.595]  And the tickets are going quickly at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:51.615 --> 00:34:06.747]  We're going to have surprise guests there, Dylan Avery of Loose Change 2 with some new video he's going to be showing, my new film Terror Storm will debut there, Professor Steven Jones, Professor Jim Fetzer, Hero of 9-11 William Rodriguez, Jimmy Walter.
[00:34:07.187 --> 00:34:09.729]  We're going to have, of course, Webster Griffin Tarpley,
[00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:11.850]  And many, many others.
[00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:13.371]  Coming up the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:21.537]  You can get your tickets at infowars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:28.222]  Before I get back in the news and your calls, I want to spend a few minutes with a great American.
[00:34:29.562 --> 00:34:33.685]  Again, here on this broadcast we don't sell magical cures to cancer.
[00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:37.348]  We don't sell magical creams that will make your cellulite go away.
[00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:42.153]  We don't sell the type of smoke and mirrors jokes.
[00:34:42.794 --> 00:34:43.734]  I'm into real things.
[00:34:43.774 --> 00:34:44.755]  I'm into credibility.
[00:34:44.855 --> 00:34:45.736]  I'm into facts.
[00:34:47.017 --> 00:34:49.078]  I relish giving you a good deal.
[00:34:49.198 --> 00:34:50.840]  I relish finding good deals.
[00:34:53.402 --> 00:34:54.702]  I enjoy being credible.
[00:34:55.243 --> 00:35:01.588]  And two years ago, Marty Schachter was already a sponsor on the Genesis Network, and he sent me a
[00:35:02.566 --> 00:35:03.586]  Your supply of soap.
[00:35:03.607 --> 00:35:08.709]  And my wife, who already buys organic soaps, which are very expensive, said, how much is this stuff?
[00:35:08.729 --> 00:35:11.870]  And I said, it's 85% off what supermarkets are.
[00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:19.333]  And she goes, this is better than the, you know, $8 a bottle organic stuff I buy, which is twice as much as the toxic chemical stuff.
[00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:22.455]  How is this so much cheaper than even the toxic stuff?
[00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:26.216]  And it's been around since 1947, almost 60 years.
[00:35:26.737 --> 00:35:28.277]  Marty's father started it now.
[00:35:28.357 --> 00:35:29.558]  Marty and his son run it.
[00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:32.290]  It's made in America, you save 85%.
[00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.513]  It's just like with the big Berkeys.
[00:35:35.613 --> 00:35:37.275]  It's made in America, the best water filter.
[00:35:37.295 --> 00:35:44.503]  You can go read all the mainstream reviews, university reviews, and it's a hundred bucks cheaper on average than some Indian or Chinese knockoff.
[00:35:44.563 --> 00:35:47.426]  So you save money buying made in America, and it's better.
[00:35:48.267 --> 00:35:51.150]  But this is organic soap before you had to say it was organic.
[00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.752]  Back when stuff was just still organic.
[00:35:53.357 --> 00:35:54.117]  Totally organic.
[00:35:54.937 --> 00:35:55.738]  This is not a joke.
[00:35:56.218 --> 00:35:59.518]  The bars of soap smell so good that staff members were laughing at me.
[00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:03.279]  I'd get it out and smell it, and I had one in my car.
[00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:14.722]  We went out to Crawford late last year to cover Sidney Sheehan, and I was in the car driving along smelling a bar of it, and they were laughing at me, and they smelled it, and they said, my gosh, it smells better than the best cologne.
[00:36:15.302 --> 00:36:17.343]  And it's the cherry oil, the almond oil.
[00:36:17.663 --> 00:36:18.403]  It's from plants.
[00:36:19.308 --> 00:36:21.769]  You know, nuts, vegetables, and citrus.
[00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:25.770]  And they've got everything, and it's totally good, and you're nuts if you don't buy it.
[00:36:26.511 --> 00:36:28.992]  And you'll save money, and it's made in America, family-owned.
[00:36:29.452 --> 00:36:30.912]  And of course, it's not on store shelves.
[00:36:31.052 --> 00:36:32.593]  I remember being in nicer hotels.
[00:36:32.613 --> 00:36:34.834]  In fact, Slick Eisen in the office pointed this out.
[00:36:34.854 --> 00:36:36.434]  He goes, I've seen this in a nice hotel before.
[00:36:37.054 --> 00:36:40.235]  Hospitals, hotels for almost 60 years have been using this.
[00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:41.256]  Rich people use it.
[00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:44.217]  I know some rich people who are like, oh yeah, I've known about that for years.
[00:36:44.757 --> 00:36:46.077]  So, this is a big secret.
[00:36:46.157 --> 00:36:52.059]  I bet you money this is in the Rockefeller or the Mellon's house and of course they're paying almost nothing for it.
[00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.239]  Alright, I've said enough.
[00:36:53.279 --> 00:36:54.079]  I gotta go quick here.
[00:36:54.419 --> 00:37:01.861]  Marty, I just can't say enough about your product and people are insane if they don't call and get a free catalog or call and get the $14 sampler pack.
[00:37:03.401 --> 00:37:04.541]  Good to hear from you, Alex.
[00:37:04.941 --> 00:37:05.881]  Good to have you on with us.
[00:37:06.462 --> 00:37:08.142]  I gotta tell you what happened yesterday.
[00:37:09.082 --> 00:37:12.483]  I got a website order from EJ in Oregon
[00:37:14.284 --> 00:37:26.772]  for a one-year supply and a message on the order said, Husband heard about your ad on the Alex Jones Show and ordered the sample monthly package.
[00:37:27.292 --> 00:37:27.973]  We liked it.
[00:37:28.493 --> 00:37:35.037]  The soap works great for our two-year-old daughter who has extremely sensitive skin.
[00:37:35.678 --> 00:37:39.200]  Thanks for the wonderful soap, Mrs. E.J.
[00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:43.463]  This is just an example of the many hundreds
[00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:46.120]  Of great comments we are receiving.
[00:37:48.762 --> 00:37:50.563]  Sounds like a B-2 bomber is landing.
[00:37:50.943 --> 00:37:52.364]  Marty, tell folks... It is!
[00:37:52.524 --> 00:37:54.165]  It is landing right here in my backyard!
[00:37:54.345 --> 00:37:55.846]  Oh my God!
[00:37:56.206 --> 00:37:57.487]  Tell us about your company.
[00:37:57.827 --> 00:37:59.769]  Tell us about the different packages you offer.
[00:38:00.289 --> 00:38:05.492]  Well, to start off, let me save... Let me solve the high price of gas.
[00:38:06.012 --> 00:38:10.315]  We're paying $3.50 to $4 a gallon a year in Northern California.
[00:38:10.939 --> 00:38:16.684]  Now, 20% of your grocery store expense is for cleaning detergents.
[00:38:17.184 --> 00:38:17.885]  I can prove that.
[00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:22.269]  I got statistical evidence which I could send out anywhere, anyhow.
[00:38:22.729 --> 00:38:32.317]  Now, if it's $100 a week for your food supply, 20% of that is going for cleaning detergents.
[00:38:32.357 --> 00:38:33.378]  That's like $20 a week.
[00:38:34.019 --> 00:38:36.401]  We can cut this down to $3 a week.
[00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:50.619]  52 weeks times $3 is $156 for delivering a one-year supply of all-natural, earth-friendly, triple-concentrated, pure soap.
[00:38:50.699 --> 00:38:53.962]  It's a gigantic box for 156 smackers.
[00:38:54.502 --> 00:38:56.163]  Yeah, that includes everything.
[00:38:56.283 --> 00:38:58.125]  Freight, tax, whatever you have.
[00:38:58.975 --> 00:39:02.136]  I mean, I buy the groceries maybe once a month.
[00:39:02.156 --> 00:39:03.296]  My wife goes twice a week.
[00:39:03.316 --> 00:39:04.357]  You know, that is with the family.
[00:39:04.977 --> 00:39:06.737]  But literally, I've seen what it costs.
[00:39:06.757 --> 00:39:16.680]  When she gives me a list, and there's all this food, I'd say I spend more in the past than 20% on the chemicals.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:23.603]  And now I buy nothing but organic, or try to, and it's got to be 40% until we started totally, I guess about a year ago.
[00:39:23.623 --> 00:39:24.723]  Well, not totally.
[00:39:24.763 --> 00:39:27.204]  I'd say about 90% of the stuff we use is Calvin Presso.
[00:39:27.504 --> 00:39:28.524]  It has saved us so much money.
[00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:38.210]  Well, a savings from $1,000 to $156 will more than cover the high price of gas plus everything else.
[00:39:38.611 --> 00:39:39.871]  So that's our deal.
[00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:51.239]  A one-year supply, which is a 65-pound box of triple concentrated pure soaps, and we guarantee it, will last a family of four.
[00:39:52.003 --> 00:39:54.644]  Anywhere from 12 to 24 months.
[00:39:54.784 --> 00:40:05.388]  Now Marty, I've made the point that I'll lather myself up in the shower and every once in a while I leave soap under my arms or between my legs or wherever and you know, horrible rash, burning, I'd have to go home, take a shower.
[00:40:06.528 --> 00:40:09.389]  But if I leave soap on myself with this, it doesn't hurt me.
[00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:14.371]  I mean, there's no animal products in this, there's no chemicals in this.
[00:40:14.391 --> 00:40:16.531]  What is in the bar soap?
[00:40:16.572 --> 00:40:17.552]  Why does it smell so good?
[00:40:18.052 --> 00:40:19.112]  It's 20% coconut oil.
[00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:39.959]  This is the highest grade USP, which means United States Pure, and 80% vegetable oils of all the safe vegetables, blended together with a few drops of pure almond oil, and you've got a bar that will last five times longer than any bar in the marketplace!
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.220]  It's pure soap.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:47.084]  We designed it originally for hospitals, for schools, for commercial enterprises,
[00:40:47.626 --> 00:40:51.367]  And this has been our business for over 50 years.
[00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:56.729]  We also have the little dispensers you send with them and we use the hand soap.
[00:40:57.149 --> 00:41:00.191]  What comes in the $14 pack, the sampler pack?
[00:41:00.511 --> 00:41:01.991]  Oh, this is very, very generous.
[00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:03.092]  It's our loss leader.
[00:41:03.552 --> 00:41:12.155]  It's got four bars of our pure soap, 16 ounces in a dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated shampoo,
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:22.726]  16 ounces in a dispenser bottle of our liquid cream pure soap for hand wash of dishes, pots and pans, windows, floors, everything.
[00:41:23.167 --> 00:41:41.140]  It's got 18 ounces in a little jar of our triple concentrated laundry soap, not a detergent, a soap, a little tiny measuring scoop to measure out the soap, a book of instructions covering all the products and all the different uses of the products.
[00:41:41.681 --> 00:41:49.585]  All put together in a 9 inch by 11 inch tote bag and then we put it in a box and we unite it parcel to your door.
[00:41:49.785 --> 00:41:54.107]  It's $14 plus united parcel delivered to your door.
[00:41:54.228 --> 00:41:54.968]  It's a bargain.
[00:41:55.504 --> 00:41:57.785]  It'll give you the taste of what we're talking about.
[00:41:57.865 --> 00:41:59.706]  Marty, folks need to call you right now.
[00:41:59.766 --> 00:42:03.428]  They need to get the $14 sampler, or at least get the free catalog.
[00:42:03.468 --> 00:42:06.789]  Believe me, folks, I only promote real things.
[00:42:07.709 --> 00:42:09.250]  This is such a great deal.
[00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.110]  You'll save money.
[00:42:10.451 --> 00:42:11.331]  It's non-toxic.
[00:42:11.351 --> 00:42:13.412]  We've got to start living our lives differently.
[00:42:13.712 --> 00:42:19.795]  And plus, you're not giving your money to the big chemical companies that are big oil, that are raping the living daylights out of everybody.
[00:42:20.155 --> 00:42:21.896]  Marty, give folks the toll-free number.
[00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:21.936]  800-340
[00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:25.410]  7-0-9-1.
[00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.281]  Some people use 1 in front of the 800, but it's 1-800...
[00:42:32.277 --> 00:42:41.145]  1-800-340-7091 or www.CalvinPureSoap.com.
[00:42:41.205 --> 00:42:46.069]  Up on www.InfoWars.com, we've got a banner on the left-hand side, over to www.CalvinPureSoap.com.
[00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:47.390]  Give Marty a call right now.
[00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:48.390]  Write it down.
[00:42:48.811 --> 00:42:49.732]  Husbands, write it down.
[00:42:49.772 --> 00:42:50.712]  Bring it home to your wife.
[00:42:51.093 --> 00:42:54.315]  Let her, you know, get a free catalog, investigate it.
[00:42:54.335 --> 00:42:57.918]  800-340-7091 or www.CalvinPureSoap.com.
[00:42:58.339 --> 00:42:59.860]  Marty, I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:43:00.646 --> 00:43:02.967]  I thank you for your wonderful endorsements.
[00:43:03.308 --> 00:43:04.068]  Oh no, listen.
[00:43:04.088 --> 00:43:12.113]  I only endorse what I hardly believe in, and I use your soap, and I love it, and I love sticking it to the New World Order chemical companies.
[00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:13.053]  You take care, my friend.
[00:43:13.073 --> 00:43:13.734]  Thank you.
[00:43:14.074 --> 00:43:14.434]  You bet.
[00:43:15.114 --> 00:43:16.675]  Folks, seriously.
[00:43:17.736 --> 00:43:20.678]  I believe in this, and it's awesome, and you need to have it.
[00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.599]  800-340-7091 or calvinpearsoap.com.
[00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:22.759]  Okay.
[00:43:25.433 --> 00:43:27.794]  Now, let me get into the news, then we'll go to some of your calls.
[00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:30.916]  The number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:43:31.417 --> 00:43:36.120]  I spent about 20 minutes of the first half hour just on the attempt to shut down the Internet.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.621]  That's how the globalists operate.
[00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:39.782]  They're monopoly men.
[00:43:40.322 --> 00:43:41.663]  They dominate markets.
[00:43:41.703 --> 00:43:43.624]  They come into already existing systems.
[00:43:43.644 --> 00:43:44.685]  They buy them up.
[00:43:45.065 --> 00:43:49.948]  They use government regulators to shut them down and to only allow you to purchase from them.
[00:43:51.582 --> 00:43:52.783]  It's the same thing with the soap.
[00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:55.225]  Marty can't get his soap on store shelves.
[00:43:55.305 --> 00:43:56.787]  It's just a few big conglomerates.
[00:43:57.147 --> 00:43:57.968]  They dominate it.
[00:43:58.008 --> 00:44:02.311]  They do payoffs, incentives, whatever to make sure you don't have access to this.
[00:44:03.192 --> 00:44:04.573]  This is how they operate.
[00:44:05.034 --> 00:44:06.575]  This is what they do.
[00:44:07.016 --> 00:44:08.837]  This is what they're all about.
[00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:12.720]  And it disgusts me to see this happening.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.363]  And they do this on a hundred times a hundred fronts.
[00:44:16.889 --> 00:44:19.270]  It's just like they're going after the gun manufacturers.
[00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.930]  They have trouble getting more gun laws passed.
[00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:24.732]  The federal government and others start funding lawsuits.
[00:44:25.112 --> 00:44:29.573]  The state government starts suing the gun manufacturers so you can't get your guns.
[00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.974]  I mean, how many gun companies?
[00:44:32.034 --> 00:44:32.715]  It's in the hundreds.
[00:44:33.175 --> 00:44:35.195]  We used to have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds more companies.
[00:44:35.936 --> 00:44:38.456]  In Austin, Austin has doubled in the last 10 years.
[00:44:38.897 --> 00:44:39.697]  And there are what?
[00:44:39.957 --> 00:44:41.297]  I was talking to a gun shop the other day.
[00:44:41.317 --> 00:44:44.479]  I think there are half the gun shops in Austin there were when we were 400,000 people.
[00:44:45.999 --> 00:44:49.021]  Now we're over a million metro, and half of them are gone?
[00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:50.702]  Is it more than half?
[00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.484]  Again, I'm getting off into other issues here.
[00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:58.626]  It's just, this is how they operate.
[00:44:59.426 --> 00:45:03.629]  It's like they're restricting the importation of ammunition right now, and it's causing a run on ammo.
[00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:11.473]  There's so many things that these monopoly men do, and this is how they control society.
[00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:25.642]  Speaking of the Monopoly men, whether it's Tamiflu, or whether it's Cipro for anthrax, or whether it's a drug for SARS, it's always some fat cat in the Bush administration making the lion's share of the money.
[00:45:26.022 --> 00:45:28.705]  Well, Tamiflu, last time I checked, it made $5 billion extra.
[00:45:29.346 --> 00:45:34.329]  In the last eight, nine months off the bird flu scare, they swore it would kill billions.
[00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:35.250]  Remember the headlines?
[00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.392]  By this time, it hasn't happened.
[00:45:38.452 --> 00:45:42.975]  It's like 130 people now that they think may have died from the bird flu.
[00:45:42.995 --> 00:45:46.056]  Well, that's where that's where flus come from is birds, folks.
[00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.418]  Again, it's all this fear mongering.
[00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:58.956]  And yesterday they come out and they say, oh my gosh, Indonesia, seven people dead, human-to-human bird flu, and within hours they had retracted it.
[00:45:59.276 --> 00:46:02.358]  No sign of bird flu mutation in the Indonesia case.
[00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:13.124]  World Health Organization states, limited human-to-human transmission of bird flu might have occurred in an Indonesian family, but there is no evidence that the virus has mutated to allow it to pass easily among people.
[00:46:13.464 --> 00:46:14.945]  The World Health Organization said,
[00:46:15.485 --> 00:46:25.631]  Fears of human-to-human transmission pushed down European shares and boosted demand for safe haven bonds on Wednesday, lifting benchmark boom futures to the highest level in more than six weeks.
[00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:26.791]  The dollar rose against the yen.
[00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:27.552]  That's a rarity.
[00:46:28.272 --> 00:46:37.197]  Concern has been growing that the case in North Sumatra, in which seven family members from a village died this month, the case is the largest family cluster known to date.
[00:46:37.297 --> 00:46:38.318]  The WHO has reported
[00:46:39.665 --> 00:46:49.730]  The WHO and Indigenous health officials are baffled over the source of the infection, but genetic sequencing has shown that H5N1 bird flu virus has not mutated in the U.N.
[00:46:50.210 --> 00:47:00.094]  Agency Settlements website WHO.ITINT on Tuesday, nor was there any sign of the virus spreading among other villagers.
[00:47:00.915 --> 00:47:07.818]  And of course it turns out these guys were raising chickens and geese right there on their property, living in it, breathing it.
[00:47:09.049 --> 00:47:16.052]  Continuing here, getting into Iran, and this is a report out of WorldNetDaily.
[00:47:16.132 --> 00:47:19.593]  Sources, Iran believes Israel to strike within the year.
[00:47:19.613 --> 00:47:22.955]  I think that's definitely very probable.
[00:47:23.255 --> 00:47:25.175]  I'd have to say 75% chance.
[00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:29.797]  Tehran planning retaliation against U.S.-British interest.
[00:47:30.578 --> 00:47:31.598]  Can you believe it?
[00:47:33.707 --> 00:47:35.211]  The wickedness of the Iranians.
[00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:39.360]  They're saying if they get hit, and our government is saying they may use nukes, that they may fight back.
[00:47:40.422 --> 00:47:43.569]  I've never heard of just barbaric
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.342]  Vicious, evil, terroristic statements like this.
[00:47:47.462 --> 00:47:54.506]  Imagine if Russia said, we're going to attack you, we're going to hit you in the next six months, and if our government said we will fight back.
[00:47:55.346 --> 00:47:56.207]  I would leave America.
[00:47:56.307 --> 00:47:57.147]  I would expatriate.
[00:47:57.207 --> 00:48:05.112]  I would roll around in the street flopping around screaming in shame that our government would dare say it would fight back.
[00:48:06.573 --> 00:48:06.993]  Wow!
[00:48:07.113 --> 00:48:07.473]  Man!
[00:48:08.794 --> 00:48:10.235]  Man, these people are evil in Iran.
[00:48:10.795 --> 00:48:12.516]  Iran believes Israel will strike within a year.
[00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:25.123]  Iran estimates Israel will strike Tehran's nuclear facilities within a year, and has been planning retaliatory strikes against Israel and America in British interest according to senior Lebanese political sources.
[00:48:25.543 --> 00:48:32.227]  The sources, speaking to World Net Daily on condition of anonymity, said Iran believes Israel has been practicing rage in Iraq.
[00:48:32.267 --> 00:48:32.908]  Well, that's admitted.
[00:48:33.208 --> 00:48:34.829]  Our government has special forces there now.
[00:48:35.518 --> 00:48:47.161]  They said, Tyran has held a series of meetings with leaders of Hezbollah terror group based along Lebanon's border with Israel about attacking the Jewish state in the event of any Israeli strike against Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:48:49.381 --> 00:48:52.422]  I just can't believe that Iran's actually talking about defending itself.
[00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:53.282]  This is unprecedented.
[00:48:54.322 --> 00:48:56.343]  I mean, that'd be like if we fought back against Hitler.
[00:48:56.383 --> 00:48:56.963]  It'd be horrible.
[00:48:58.043 --> 00:49:02.704]  The sources said, while Iran is expecting lone Israeli military action,
[00:49:03.795 --> 00:49:07.938]  Iranian intelligence estimates the Jewish state is coordinating a planned attack with the U.S.
[00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:08.578]  Well, of course.
[00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:31.313]  What'll happen is the Israelis will hit 200 sites, Iran will shoot fire cruise missiles into two different areas, blow up a bunch of ships, the globalists will have some PR firm showing people throwing babies out of incubators, and then they'll nuke Tehran and blow the whole place up, and there'll be celebrations in the streets, neocons roll around enjoying themselves.
[00:49:32.859 --> 00:49:46.728]  I've talked to liquor store owners and pizza delivery people, I've talked to both, and they say that during attacks, it didn't 4th of July, it didn't New Year's, record pizza and liquor sales in the Super Bowl.
[00:49:47.449 --> 00:50:01.458]  It's the days before the attack and the attack, and these people think it's manly to sit there with giant pot bellies, drinking aspartame-laced drinks, watching television, and literally getting off on buildings blowing up.
[00:50:02.719 --> 00:50:03.700]  Man, I've talked to them, too.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.541]  They just turned them into a parking lot.
[00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:06.281]  Chill!
[00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:07.122]  I'm manly!
[00:50:09.343 --> 00:50:16.607]  Meanwhile, the government's stealing your pension funds, scamming you, gonna put toll roads in to scam you, getting rid of our borders, destroying America.
[00:50:18.568 --> 00:50:20.509]  You're not part of the elite, Dumbo.
[00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.912]  You people stick George Bush or Bill Clinton or Al Gore or Hillary stickers on your cars.
[00:50:25.972 --> 00:50:28.574]  I see you driving around feeling like you're part of the system.
[00:50:29.354 --> 00:50:30.275]  You're a joke.
[00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:32.582]  You're a joke!
[00:50:33.643 --> 00:50:35.925]  You love being sappy and stupid!
[00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:39.788]  I was listening on my wife's XM radio.
[00:50:39.808 --> 00:50:41.029]  She's got it in her car last night.
[00:50:41.049 --> 00:50:42.410]  I was using her car because mine's in the shop.
[00:50:43.231 --> 00:50:44.252]  Oh, I'll tell you the story after the break.
[00:50:44.272 --> 00:50:45.053]  I'm gonna take a few calls.
[00:50:45.533 --> 00:50:46.474]  Got a big guest coming up.
[00:50:47.755 --> 00:50:50.998]  And, uh... No, I'll just finish the story when we get back.
[00:50:52.339 --> 00:50:54.141]  And I was listening to this station.
[00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:57.744]  It's a station called, uh... called America.
[00:50:58.783 --> 00:51:01.345]  And it is the worst propaganda I've ever heard in my life.
[00:51:01.845 --> 00:51:08.669]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.989 --> 00:51:10.370]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:12.771]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.931 --> 00:51:15.012]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.293 --> 00:51:20.215]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.556 --> 00:51:24.578]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.838 --> 00:51:26.619]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.679 --> 00:51:37.345]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.486 --> 00:51:39.387]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.587 --> 00:51:43.469]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.

[00:52:09.002 --> 00:52:19.928]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.188 --> 00:52:21.989]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.269 --> 00:52:25.570]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:36.353]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.673 --> 00:52:37.173]  That's right!
[00:52:37.353 --> 00:52:44.455]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.755 --> 00:52:48.877]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:54:11.588 --> 00:54:19.093]  Yesterday at the end of the broadcast, I played a two and a half minute clip of an army ranger talking about how they threaten to blow people's children's heads off in front of them.
[00:54:19.133 --> 00:54:21.275]  They do blow their heads off in Iraq in these houses.
[00:54:21.895 --> 00:54:24.197]  They fondle the women to get the men to answer questions.
[00:54:24.217 --> 00:54:25.618]  And this is all in White House memos.
[00:54:25.938 --> 00:54:26.779]  Torturing children.
[00:54:27.179 --> 00:54:27.860]  We've gone over it.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.541]  But, I mean, this is going on.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.464]  And I do not support that.
[00:54:31.524 --> 00:54:32.346]  Do you understand?
[00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:36.338]  Supporting the military doesn't mean turning them into a bunch of pig Nazis.
[00:54:36.599 --> 00:54:36.899]  Okay?
[00:54:37.802 --> 00:54:38.103]  Simple.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.922]  And I listened last night, driving to the office, driving back home at like 2 a.m.
[00:54:43.402 --> 00:54:44.503]  I listened to a bunch of these songs.
[00:54:44.523 --> 00:54:46.784]  There was one I think called, Thanks to You, and it sounded real good.
[00:54:46.804 --> 00:54:50.586]  You know, thanks to you the troops, the heroes aren't on the stage, it's you.
[00:54:50.686 --> 00:54:51.667]  Oh, you're so good.
[00:54:51.687 --> 00:54:53.307]  Oh, America's so good.
[00:54:53.347 --> 00:54:54.608]  We're standing up for freedom.
[00:54:55.108 --> 00:54:57.530]  Oh, we have our freedoms because of this war.
[00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.251]  We do not have our freedoms because of this war.
[00:55:00.611 --> 00:55:07.675]  The people attacking Iraq and about to attack Iran are taking our freedoms and waging war against us and getting rid of our borders.
[00:55:10.368 --> 00:55:12.269]  Yeah, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.231]  I'll play this clip when our guest is on with us in the next hour.
[00:55:15.671 --> 00:55:16.632]  I promise to go to calls.
[00:55:16.712 --> 00:55:17.332]  We'll play it later.
[00:55:17.352 --> 00:55:19.913]  And I'm also getting the song, Thanks to You, if I Can Find It.
[00:55:19.933 --> 00:55:20.774]  I think that's the name of it.
[00:55:22.054 --> 00:55:24.196]  Bob in Nevada, then Scott, Ron, and others.
[00:55:24.236 --> 00:55:24.736]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:55:24.796 --> 00:55:25.096]  Hello.
[00:55:25.256 --> 00:55:25.897]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:26.237 --> 00:55:27.918]  I have a question.
[00:55:28.038 --> 00:55:29.138]  I have a ton of stuff.
[00:55:29.539 --> 00:55:35.462]  I just returned from South America, but I really have a question I really want to see if you have any information on.
[00:55:35.502 --> 00:55:39.504]  I've been reading the Jeff French website for years now.
[00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:52.698]  And I've read various articles about, now that our deficit is going like crazy intentionally, there's a law that says the government can take all the assets of Americans
[00:55:53.337 --> 00:55:55.700]  Citizens to pay off a foreign debt.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.801]  Yeah, no, no, sir.
[00:55:56.901 --> 00:55:57.922]  We are pledged.
[00:55:57.982 --> 00:56:00.745]  The national parks, our pensions, our taxes.
[00:56:00.886 --> 00:56:02.007]  We are pledged, sir.
[00:56:02.047 --> 00:56:02.748]  That is official.
[00:56:02.988 --> 00:56:04.189]  Our homes, everything.
[00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:06.612]  It's in the executive orders.
[00:56:06.692 --> 00:56:07.974]  It's in the loan guarantees.
[00:56:08.034 --> 00:56:08.514]  It's in it all.
[00:56:09.075 --> 00:56:11.738]  And they have been signing agreements.
[00:56:11.758 --> 00:56:13.300]  I have moved most of my
[00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:27.669]  Sir, what's happened is the foreign countries are holding dollars, that's why the Chinese and the Iranians, not mainly the Iranians, the folks in the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, that's why they're buying everything up, sir.
[00:56:28.289 --> 00:56:41.117]  I've moved most of my money and my assets, my money, into European banks because I knew the dollar was going down, but I understand the government has signed agreements with foreign countries.
[00:56:41.653 --> 00:56:43.797]  Including the Czech Republic, they just did.
[00:56:44.017 --> 00:56:46.001]  Yes, they've signed agreements to take your money.
[00:56:46.241 --> 00:56:48.365]  They've signed agreements to take your money out of those countries.
[00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:55.517]  And any concept, anything you could do, the only thing, there's no agreement with Russia, but I think...
[00:56:56.024 --> 00:56:57.004]  You know, that's about it.
[00:56:57.044 --> 00:56:59.885]  They've also steamrolled agreements with Switzerland.
[00:56:59.905 --> 00:57:01.105]  That happened two years ago.
[00:57:01.145 --> 00:57:02.105]  That's unprecedented.
[00:57:02.545 --> 00:57:06.446]  They have steamrolled agreements with Spain, with the Caribbean nations.
[00:57:07.046 --> 00:57:12.747]  There is basically nowhere to hide your money but in precious metals, or in real estate, and they can still take that.
[00:57:13.027 --> 00:57:14.967]  Yeah, precious metals, you can't move with it.
[00:57:15.007 --> 00:57:16.588]  You can't go across the border with it.
[00:57:17.508 --> 00:57:21.448]  Well, you can't get across the border with your house and your money isn't safe in the banks.
[00:57:21.468 --> 00:57:22.649]  No, yeah, that's right.
[00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:24.689]  And the money I've moved, but I mean,
[00:57:25.907 --> 00:57:27.528]  Welcome to slavery, sir.
[00:57:27.568 --> 00:57:40.293]  The best thing you can have, the most valuable thing you can have, is friends and family you can trust, and skills, like dentistry, carpentry, barber, you know, all the skills they can't take from you.
[00:57:40.633 --> 00:57:45.694]  I don't have any of that, and all my relatives still tend to trust Bush.
[00:57:46.655 --> 00:57:47.115]  It's pathetic.
[00:57:47.135 --> 00:57:47.615]  Well, good for them.
[00:57:47.635 --> 00:57:49.096]  They're going to get financially destroyed.
[00:57:49.156 --> 00:57:49.776]  I'll pay them for that.
[00:57:50.976 --> 00:57:52.357]  They can go down with the Titanic.
[00:57:52.884 --> 00:58:19.376]  By the way, in Brazil I talked to someone who told me that in 1964 there was a plot to blow up the tank farm on the inner side of Rio and it would have gone through except for one of the military who was going to do it squealed and the whole thing was planned and backed by the CIA and everybody in Brazil heard about it.
[00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:30.112]  Well, sir, the CIA has overthrown over 50 countries, and their favorite tactic is to carry out terror attacks and blame it on their enemies.
[00:58:30.152 --> 00:58:35.753]  Yeah, we're going to blame it on the Communists, but this fits right in with the Northwoods and all those.
[00:58:35.793 --> 00:58:36.353]  I know.
[00:58:36.393 --> 00:58:37.253]  I've got to end this hour.
[00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:37.693]  Thank you.
[00:58:38.093 --> 00:58:38.653]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:38.693 --> 00:58:39.153]  Good caller.
[00:58:41.374 --> 00:58:46.035]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.658 --> 00:58:58.278]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.959 --> 00:59:00.000]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.821]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:03.302]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.062 --> 00:59:04.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.624 --> 00:59:09.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.806 --> 00:59:13.909]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.049 --> 00:59:19.833]  We're going to take some more calls right now, continue with calls throughout the hour and cover a ton of vital news.
[00:59:20.574 --> 00:59:24.897]  Glenn Yadin, author of The Nazi Hydra in America, will be joining us after this break.
[00:59:25.532 --> 00:59:26.773]  Let's move quickly to your call.
[00:59:26.913 --> 00:59:27.753]  Scott in Texas.
[00:59:27.813 --> 00:59:28.634]  Scott, you're on the air.
[00:59:28.714 --> 00:59:29.174]  Go ahead.
[00:59:30.435 --> 00:59:31.636]  Alex, I'm not in Texas.
[00:59:31.676 --> 00:59:32.736]  I'm in upstate New York.
[00:59:33.217 --> 00:59:33.757]  Well, whatever.
[00:59:33.797 --> 00:59:35.978]  They told me Texas, so we'll just say Texas.
[00:59:36.278 --> 00:59:38.159]  Hey, I might see you over there in Canada.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.901]  Real quick, I'll go through as quickly as I can.
[00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:42.402]  Thanks for being on, number one.
[00:59:42.482 --> 00:59:44.343]  Thanks for lighting a fire under me again.
[00:59:47.194 --> 00:59:53.356]  Firstly, I heard Michael Savage on the radio, and he might be coming around a little bit, so some callers can get through to him.
[00:59:53.396 --> 00:59:55.597]  He's starting to talk about this world takeover.
[00:59:56.017 --> 00:59:58.018]  I was shocked to hear it, but it's true.
[00:59:58.158 --> 00:59:59.198]  Well, the election's over.
[00:59:59.238 --> 00:59:59.979]  Bush is in.
[01:00:00.039 --> 01:00:00.939]  Everything's fine.
[01:00:01.279 --> 01:00:02.419]  They always do that.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.041]  But then we've got to attack the Arabs, though, to fight the world takeover, right?
[01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:06.421]  True.
[01:00:06.681 --> 01:00:10.102]  He doesn't have it all, but perhaps he's coming around.
[01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:10.902]  He's not stupid.
[01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:12.123]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:15.764]  He promotes the globalist agenda while claiming he fights the globalists.
[01:00:16.124 --> 01:00:19.166]  You know better than I do, so I concede to what you just said.
[01:00:19.206 --> 01:00:22.028]  You know he was the top beatnik organizer in the 60s.
[01:00:22.889 --> 01:00:23.529]  I knew that.
[01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:27.071]  I don't want to say on air what he's written in books about other men.
[01:00:27.632 --> 01:00:28.793]  I'm just going to leave it at that, sir.
[01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:33.916]  Let's just say he's real conservative, about as conservative as Hillary Clinton.
[01:00:34.571 --> 01:00:36.512]  Okay, I'm glad you straightened me out.
[01:00:36.592 --> 01:00:37.413]  Look, look, look.
[01:00:37.473 --> 01:00:39.634]  These commies learned how to fool people.
[01:00:40.014 --> 01:00:40.274]  Okay?
[01:00:40.294 --> 01:00:42.815]  They have to pose as us to destroy us.
[01:00:43.696 --> 01:00:48.939]  I concede to you, because you know more than I do about the characters that are talking about this.
[01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.319]  No question about it.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.981]  One other thing I'd like to bring up, your American Yardstick.
[01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.042]  It's a book written by Hamilton A. Byrd Long.
[01:00:56.382 --> 01:00:57.103]  Try to get it.
[01:00:57.263 --> 01:00:59.644]  It's great on the Constitution of the United States.
[01:00:59.684 --> 01:01:00.305]  Sounds good.
[01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:03.026]  And I'm going to give you a copy when I see you.
[01:01:04.258 --> 01:01:05.859]  It's very difficult to get these books.
[01:01:06.979 --> 01:01:10.700]  And the third thing is Cardinal Mahoney.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:18.322]  I want everyone to know in the movement that we're in to save this country, that this man is not a Catholic.
[01:01:18.362 --> 01:01:23.363]  That the Catholic Church has been taken over by modernists who destroyed it.
[01:01:23.483 --> 01:01:28.384]  Remember, the Catholic Church forbid anyone to become a Mason.
[01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:31.500]  That was a law of the Catholic Church.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.883]  Today the Catholic Church allows its laity to become Freemasons.
[01:01:37.943 --> 01:01:40.584]  Not only the laity, it's in the priesthood itself.
[01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:54.170]  So please, there's a difference between true traditional Catholics like myself and these people, the millions that claim to be Catholics, who really are being fooled by the infiltrators of the Catholic Church that happened in the 60s.
[01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:57.370]  All right, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:57.911]  Thank you.
[01:01:58.311 --> 01:01:59.612]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:01:59.772 --> 01:02:00.532]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:02:01.573 --> 01:02:02.133]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:02.574 --> 01:02:04.015]  I'm going to digress for just a moment.
[01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:11.079]  As far as Savage is concerned, people should know that he and the beat poet Ginsberg used to take trips to Fiji in the late 1960s.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.121]  So I think that tells you really the truth about his foundation.
[01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:15.482]  Yeah, let's leave it right there.
[01:02:15.522 --> 01:02:19.285]  People can read Savage's own words about the love affair.
[01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:20.185]  I just want to leave it there.
[01:02:20.585 --> 01:02:24.308]  That's correct, and I'm going to move forward to another topic more exigent and relevant.
[01:02:24.969 --> 01:02:27.471]  Cameras, cameras everywhere, more cameras.
[01:02:28.131 --> 01:02:39.578]  New York City, using of course federal funds provided through various Homeland Security grants, your government at work, is going to put multiple cameras on public buses plus, plus microphones.
[01:02:40.222 --> 01:02:42.604]  Just in case there's a terrorist or a criminal on the bus.
[01:02:42.624 --> 01:02:45.286]  Yeah, Austin already has it, and they're putting it in the school buses.
[01:02:45.406 --> 01:02:46.407]  Everything's a prison.
[01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:48.789]  America will be a prison, is a prison.
[01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:50.350]  Well, doesn't even stop there.
[01:02:50.571 --> 01:02:57.236]  The famous, nationally famous Rutgers University will install 700 cameras, of course, only for your safety.
[01:02:57.757 --> 01:02:59.018]  It's always for your safety.
[01:02:59.058 --> 01:03:00.419]  They put a noose around your neck.
[01:03:00.979 --> 01:03:04.080]  They kick the chair out from under you, and they tell you it's for your safety.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.441]  You know, well, we're preventing you from suffering a greater fate at the hands of an alien.
[01:03:08.481 --> 01:03:09.241]  Well, what do the Nazis say?
[01:03:09.281 --> 01:03:11.742]  We're taking you to a concentration camp for your safety.
[01:03:11.802 --> 01:03:12.762]  Your safety, that's right.
[01:03:12.803 --> 01:03:14.803]  That's what they told most of the people that they eliminated.
[01:03:14.843 --> 01:03:17.844]  It was for their safety, because the general population might attack them.
[01:03:18.388 --> 01:03:22.170]  They pull the trucks up to the pits to shoot them and say this is for your safety.
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:24.432]  This is a lie that's come down to the ages.
[01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:27.854]  People would march into those pits with their children for their safety.
[01:03:28.114 --> 01:03:29.995]  Now in play here in the United States.
[01:03:30.315 --> 01:03:31.236]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:03:31.276 --> 01:03:33.857]  Ron, I'll hold you over and after we go to the guests a little bit I'll go back to you.
[01:03:34.238 --> 01:03:35.338]  I've just got to add this.
[01:03:36.199 --> 01:03:37.920]  Romans 13 says obey your government.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:44.864]  So I guess the people, if you believe the way they interpret that, marching into those pits were obeying the Lord.
[01:03:45.324 --> 01:03:47.946]  Of course that's not the truth, but so what?
[01:03:48.863 --> 01:03:49.924]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.566 --> 01:03:57.408]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.249]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:04:04.592 --> 01:04:11.336]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.656 --> 01:04:13.638]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.838 --> 01:04:16.680]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:21.444]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.644 --> 01:04:26.047]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:04:55.242 --> 01:04:56.283]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.603 --> 01:04:59.386]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:03.811]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:05.072]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.392 --> 01:05:09.957]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:12.562]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:06:27.568 --> 01:06:27.988]  I think so.
[01:06:54.685 --> 01:07:00.709]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:04.351]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.452 --> 01:07:08.353]  Alright, we're going to take calls in this hour.
[01:07:08.533 --> 01:07:09.894]  I know the phones are loaded up.
[01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:13.736]  Call for your number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:07:14.456 --> 01:07:18.859]  And interspersed throughout the calls, we're going to be talking about the Nazi Hydra in America in this book.
[01:07:20.279 --> 01:07:34.684]  But I promised last hour, when we started this hour, I would play, before we go to our esteemed guest, this edit down of a 22-minute clip we've got up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com from video of a U.S.
[01:07:34.824 --> 01:07:41.366]  Army Ranger, highly decorated, talking about what they do on these night raids all over Iraq.
[01:07:42.107 --> 01:07:46.868]  Now, this is in the White House memos, John Yoo, Attorney General Albuquerque Gonzalez memos.
[01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:48.429]  It's in the Army Doctrine.
[01:07:49.521 --> 01:07:51.462]  And they torture children in front of their parents.
[01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:52.223]  This is on record.
[01:07:52.263 --> 01:07:54.624]  White House counsel has said on the record they do this.
[01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.465]  The troops are told to do this.
[01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:57.905]  They blow children's heads off.
[01:07:58.386 --> 01:07:59.566]  They fondle lives.
[01:07:59.606 --> 01:08:03.468]  I mean, this is like the bad guys in some spaghetti western.
[01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:07.750]  Last night I got on the exercise bike and I watched for a few dollars more.
[01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:11.312]  And you know, it's got the bad guys doing mean things to someone's wife.
[01:08:11.372 --> 01:08:14.574]  And you know, this is the worst person in a fictitious movie.
[01:08:14.874 --> 01:08:18.796]  You know, to build them up as a bad guy, they do bad things to women and children.
[01:08:19.326 --> 01:08:21.069]  Well, that's what our government does.
[01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:25.577]  I mean, with the My Lai Massacre, people went to jail for this.
[01:08:25.637 --> 01:08:28.663]  Now it's doctrine, and no one gets in trouble.
[01:08:30.043 --> 01:08:41.231]  I mean, even the Nazis didn't publicly admit all this, so I want to play this little two-minute clip, and again, the whole clip's up on the website, from the video where he talks about what they do.
[01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:49.037]  And again, this has been in a bunch of other news articles, but here is a Ranger on record talking about how he signed up to fight elite troops.
[01:08:49.657 --> 01:08:53.021]  He didn't sign up to blow children's heads off.
[01:08:53.061 --> 01:08:54.262]  Listen, he first says they threaten them.
[01:08:54.282 --> 01:09:00.969]  He says in some cases they go ahead and shoot them and do things sexually to the wives in front of the whole families.
[01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:03.492]  This is what the good guys do.
[01:09:03.972 --> 01:09:04.833]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:09:09.919 --> 01:09:11.200]  Well, that's an exciting clip.
[01:09:13.329 --> 01:09:14.910]  I'll tell you Murphy's Law with these computers.
[01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:17.531]  Ted uses computers built in the 1930's.
[01:09:17.891 --> 01:09:18.772]  That's a joke folks.
[01:09:18.812 --> 01:09:19.312]  The network.
[01:09:19.772 --> 01:09:21.953]  And for some reason that clip played fine yesterday.
[01:09:21.973 --> 01:09:22.713]  It didn't play today.
[01:09:23.113 --> 01:09:24.014]  This is all very exciting.
[01:09:24.754 --> 01:09:25.595]  Is it working now?
[01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.076]  We'll try it over and over again here.
[01:09:28.096 --> 01:09:35.459]  After the debriefing they had us go out and cut out the bunkers.
[01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:37.860]  After the Air Force bombed the crap out of them.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.981]  So we had to go in there and make sure everything in there was dead still.
[01:09:41.587 --> 01:09:47.989]  So, um, whether it was women, children, whatever, if they weren't dead, we'd be ready to finish them off and drag their bodies out.
[01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:56.251]  And a lot of times, you know, like, the intelligence on it, a lot of times, I don't even think, you know, that they, I think they knew there were no insurgents in there.
[01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:00.032]  I think, you know, they just, they just said that.
[01:10:00.592 --> 01:10:10.915]  We were doing the night raids in houses, and, um, we would pull people out, and we'd have them all, like, on their knees and zip-tied.
[01:10:11.764 --> 01:10:14.747]  And we'll ask the guy questions, the whole family.
[01:10:15.347 --> 01:10:17.009]  The man in the house questions.
[01:10:18.009 --> 01:10:22.553]  And if he didn't answer, the way we would like to, you know, we'll shoot his youngest kid in the head.
[01:10:22.993 --> 01:10:26.456]  And we'll keep going, because this is our interrogation.
[01:10:26.476 --> 01:10:27.557]  He could be innocent, you know.
[01:10:27.797 --> 01:10:31.000]  He could just be an average Joe just trying to support his family.
[01:10:32.181 --> 01:10:38.026]  And if he didn't give us a satisfactory answer, we'll start killing off his family until we told us something.
[01:10:38.849 --> 01:10:43.632]  If he didn't know anything, you'd guess he was SOL, you know, and would suck, you know.
[01:10:43.652 --> 01:10:44.353]  I didn't feel that.
[01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:45.854]  I just wanted to do my job.
[01:10:45.974 --> 01:10:48.176]  I wanted to be a good ranger, you know.
[01:10:48.196 --> 01:10:48.896]  I wanted to lead the way.
[01:10:49.356 --> 01:10:51.158]  We just have to scare them first, you know.
[01:10:51.178 --> 01:11:02.706]  Like, we would beat them up or kick them or hit their wife or like a couple of guys would fondle on their wives, you know, just to piss them off, try to get them to say something.
[01:11:03.606 --> 01:11:04.407]  And they didn't do it.
[01:11:05.247 --> 01:11:05.968]  We'll do that to, like,
[01:11:06.932 --> 01:11:08.612]  Maybe several houses.
[01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:11.453]  Multiple houses.
[01:11:11.733 --> 01:11:14.913]  Slaughtering, you know, 30-40 people a night sometimes.
[01:11:15.033 --> 01:11:16.914]  They're doing the houses, women and children.
[01:11:16.934 --> 01:11:20.534]  I didn't sign up to kill women and children, you know.
[01:11:21.014 --> 01:11:26.135]  I was trained, you know, in all the ranger school and 18 months of that crap, you know.
[01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:27.576]  I didn't want to kill.
[01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.716]  I wanted to challenge, you know.
[01:11:29.196 --> 01:11:30.856]  I wanted to fight other elite soldiers.
[01:11:30.896 --> 01:11:31.816]  Go out and be, you know.
[01:11:32.716 --> 01:11:34.477]  But I had to go fight kids.
[01:11:35.437 --> 01:11:35.897]  And women.
[01:11:36.795 --> 01:11:38.656]  Innocent people that don't know how to fight.
[01:11:42.957 --> 01:11:44.537]  I really got disappointed in my country.
[01:11:44.697 --> 01:11:47.558]  I got disappointed in my government.
[01:11:49.379 --> 01:11:56.421]  For those that don't know, we have another clip from Frontline where they find a family taking a few pieces of wood out of a field.
[01:11:56.861 --> 01:12:02.243]  So they machine gun the car, they laugh, and then they run over the car with an Abrams tank and say, this is your punishment.
[01:12:02.967 --> 01:12:05.029]  So we have stuff like this on video, but imagine.
[01:12:05.509 --> 01:12:06.990]  Imagine the troops came to your house.
[01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:09.772]  Somebody in the neighborhood was an insurgent.
[01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.554]  And so they said, we're going to question you now.
[01:12:12.574 --> 01:12:14.896]  And they hogtied everybody with the plastic handcuffs.
[01:12:14.916 --> 01:12:15.617]  You're all on the ground.
[01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:16.998]  And they're there.
[01:12:17.678 --> 01:12:18.339]  You're the husband.
[01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:19.700]  Your sons and daughters are there.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.821]  They have big families in Iraq.
[01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:22.242]  The average family has four children.
[01:12:22.802 --> 01:12:26.205]  And imagine your wife sitting there while they rip her clothes off, while they grab on her.
[01:12:27.256 --> 01:12:30.437]  And then they just take the five-year-old, line him up, and boom!
[01:12:30.557 --> 01:12:31.777]  Brains all over the wall.
[01:12:31.797 --> 01:12:33.477]  And we've talked to the troops on air about this.
[01:12:33.937 --> 01:12:38.358]  Imagine a little boy, dead, blood just pouring out of the head.
[01:12:38.658 --> 01:12:40.559]  Brains all over the wall, the family.
[01:12:41.059 --> 01:12:43.919]  We've seen the photos of little toddlers just screaming.
[01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:46.040]  I've never seen looks of pain.
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.100]  Remember those AP photos?
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.860]  Just blood all over them.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.241]  And the troops are going, Yeah!
[01:12:50.301 --> 01:12:50.841]  World leader!
[01:12:50.901 --> 01:12:51.181]  Team!
[01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:51.441]  Team!
[01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:53.022]  Oh yeah, we're good.
[01:12:53.182 --> 01:12:53.622]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:53.822 --> 01:12:55.122]  And they're all coming back here.
[01:12:55.423 --> 01:12:59.404]  They're all coming out here to command FEMA and take your guns and put you in camps.
[01:12:59.604 --> 01:13:01.165]  Houston Chronicle, they built camps.
[01:13:01.785 --> 01:13:03.166]  And they're all coming back here.
[01:13:03.506 --> 01:13:05.287]  The ones that like it are being promoted.
[01:13:05.307 --> 01:13:07.587]  We're going to have death squads in America.
[01:13:09.068 --> 01:13:12.309]  And then we got all these sappy songs about America's good.
[01:13:12.349 --> 01:13:13.470]  We're doing good.
[01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.311]  Defending our freedom and our right.
[01:13:16.411 --> 01:13:17.131]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:17.391 --> 01:13:18.532]  Got a song I'm going to play later.
[01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:20.390]  We're not defending anything.
[01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:24.192]  The people destroying Iraq are taking your freedom right now here in America.
[01:13:25.292 --> 01:13:28.493]  So, if you want to sign on to this, you go ahead and sign up with Satan.
[01:13:28.513 --> 01:13:33.515]  Let me tell you, you're just as guilty as the troops blowing little kids' heads off in front of their mommies and daddies.
[01:13:33.795 --> 01:13:38.276]  I want you to think about people coming into your house hog-tying you and blowing your kids' head off in front of you.
[01:13:38.537 --> 01:13:41.978]  I want you, you scumbag neocon pieces of trash.
[01:13:42.358 --> 01:13:44.439]  I want you to image that.
[01:13:45.019 --> 01:13:47.039]  I want you to get it through your heads.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.560]  I want you to face it.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:54.105]  I've had Marine Master Sergeants, Marine Captains on, talking about similar things.
[01:13:54.465 --> 01:13:55.706]  This is what's going on.
[01:13:55.726 --> 01:13:58.269]  Alright, I apologize to our guests, but I promise to play that.
[01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:00.631]  And your calls are coming up.
[01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:03.514]  By the way, go find that old clip of them running over the tank.
[01:14:03.594 --> 01:14:04.675]  I mean, the tank running over the car.
[01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:05.496]  I'm going to play that later.
[01:14:05.516 --> 01:14:09.260]  I'm going to play this sick song later where they twist it all.
[01:14:11.262 --> 01:14:12.123]  Our guest is Glenn
[01:14:12.862 --> 01:14:15.024]  Yadin, he's author of the Nazi Hydra in America.
[01:14:15.044 --> 01:14:17.827]  We've got links to how you can get it off on Infowars.com.
[01:14:17.867 --> 01:14:21.790]  And this gets into the Nazi state-of-the-art networks in the U.S., their financing.
[01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:23.592]  Of course, the Bushes are all involved in this.
[01:14:23.652 --> 01:14:25.634]  I covered it in my film, Martial Law.
[01:14:26.915 --> 01:14:33.141]  Glenn, sorry you had to sit through that, but were you aware that they're torturing and blowing children's heads off in front of their parents?
[01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:37.405]  Yes, I read that here a couple days ago when it first came out on the web.
[01:14:38.476 --> 01:14:40.938]  I guess we're all feeling pretty proud of ourselves right now.
[01:14:42.318 --> 01:14:49.203]  Yeah, I can't say that I was surprised by that, frankly, given this administration.
[01:14:49.223 --> 01:15:01.830]  You know, the people that don't go over to pure evil when they do this are all going to break down and be time bombs in this country, but I'd say 40% of them are going to like it, and they're going to be secret police here in America.
[01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:04.992]  Iraq is a huge laboratory to produce these people.
[01:15:05.232 --> 01:15:06.933]  Oh, I agree with you on that.
[01:15:07.113 --> 01:15:08.134]  If you look at it,
[01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:11.617]  What was the first thing that Bush did when he came into office?
[01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:14.897]  He wanted the Serviceman Protection Act passed.
[01:15:16.978 --> 01:15:22.398]  Basically, it called for the invasion of the Netherlands if any U.S.
[01:15:22.438 --> 01:15:26.219]  serviceman found himself at the Hague on war crimes.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.100]  Sir, tell us about yourself and tell us about your research that went into Nazi Hydra.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:36.281]  Okay, well, the Nazi Hydra started out here
[01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:39.511]  About ten years ago, I started researching it.
[01:15:40.572 --> 01:15:51.738]  It basically traces the history of fascism in this country from, oh, starting in about the 1920s to about the 1950s at this point in time.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.581]  The Bushes definitely played a big role in that.
[01:15:57.681 --> 01:16:05.406]  It didn't start out to be an anti-Bush book, but when you got Grandpa Prescott being Hitler's
[01:16:06.836 --> 01:16:17.001]  Yeah, there's a lot of negative things in there on the Bush family and their relationship to the Nazis, and they still continue that relationship.
[01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:27.725]  The one thing about American fascism is it's very tightly wound about a few elite families in this country.
[01:16:28.426 --> 01:16:29.086]  Tell us about it.
[01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:29.846]  Go through your book.
[01:16:31.869 --> 01:16:39.991]  The basic one, the first thing that you can really point to is the attempted assassination of Roosevelt, or an attempted coup on him.
[01:16:40.431 --> 01:16:48.973]  And by the way, that is in the Congressional testimony, and in the record, General Smedley Butler, a Marine Corps General, went public and they tried to hire him for a coup.
[01:16:49.513 --> 01:16:50.294]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:16:51.054 --> 01:16:57.175]  It involved a large number of, well, blue bloods, if you will.
[01:16:58.155 --> 01:16:59.496]  The Morgans were involved in it.
[01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:01.635]  The American Legion
[01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:38.650]  And by the way, the very same progeny, the very same grandchildren of these people are now setting up a dictatorship in America.
[01:17:41.112 --> 01:17:58.924]  Incidentally, George DePoppi here, I just ran across it, he wrote an introduction to a German-American discussion forum that's connected up to the Tysons yet.
[01:18:01.728 --> 01:18:04.309]  George specifically, who?
[01:18:04.329 --> 01:18:05.329]  Poppy.
[01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:07.210]  You're talking about the former president?
[01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.710]  Right.
[01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:09.310]  That's his nickname is Poppy?
[01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:10.711]  That's what I call him.
[01:18:12.991 --> 01:18:17.773]  Before we got a break and come back and cover more of this, tell the listeners about yourself, Glenn Yadin.
[01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:22.074]  Well, basically I was raised, educated as a chemist.
[01:18:23.194 --> 01:18:24.795]  My degree was in chemistry.
[01:18:26.843 --> 01:18:31.165]  I was working on a doctorate in environmental chemistry before I had to give it up because of finances.
[01:18:33.647 --> 01:18:34.087]  I don't know.
[01:18:34.107 --> 01:18:36.968]  I always had an interest in World War II.
[01:18:38.449 --> 01:18:39.270]  A deep interest in it.
[01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:44.352]  And so like so many people, you just began researching World War II and wow, found out about the Nazi Americans.
[01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:45.553]  Stay there, sir.
[01:18:45.593 --> 01:18:46.573]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:18:46.613 --> 01:18:48.194]  Your calls are coming up as well, folks.
[01:18:48.514 --> 01:18:50.095]  And a bunch of other key audio clips.
[01:18:50.415 --> 01:18:51.256]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:18:53.433 --> 01:18:55.034]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.394 --> 01:19:01.138]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[01:19:53.883 --> 01:19:57.807]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:58.007 --> 01:20:10.298]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:11.118]  The U.S.
[01:20:11.178 --> 01:20:16.763]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:17.144 --> 01:20:19.366]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:22.267]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:22.307 --> 01:20:25.148]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:25.268 --> 01:20:31.310]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:31.711 --> 01:20:35.072]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:20:57.267 --> 01:21:06.816]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:21:07.887 --> 01:21:17.434]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:21:18.455 --> 01:21:23.978]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.670]  He's an author of Nazi Hydra in America.
[01:22:58.710 --> 01:22:59.871]  It's a very well-researched book.
[01:23:00.031 --> 01:23:04.276]  It's put out by the same publisher that put out Tarpley's 9-11 Synthetic Tear.
[01:23:04.676 --> 01:23:05.917]  Made in the USA that we carry.
[01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.359]  I might be carrying Nazi Hydra.
[01:23:07.379 --> 01:23:08.961]  I haven't read it all yet, but it's excellent.
[01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:11.183]  What I have read is exactly on target.
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:13.401]  I've done extensive research.
[01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.541]  I've made a film about this.
[01:23:14.581 --> 01:23:19.424]  The last 45 minutes of Martial Law, my three-hour film, covers the Nazi Hydra.
[01:23:19.444 --> 01:23:20.384]  It's a good term for it.
[01:23:20.845 --> 01:23:25.587]  For those who don't know, eugenics, American financiers, it all really started here.
[01:23:25.607 --> 01:23:36.093]  They actually went and funded Hitler with the British, set him all up kind of as a wind-up toy, and when that faction failed, they went underground with hundreds of billions of funds, and that went into the CIA.
[01:23:36.113 --> 01:23:40.235]  They brought Nazis here to run our rocketry, to set up our CIA, basically everything.
[01:23:40.735 --> 01:23:46.061]  And now we've got an army that goes around blowing small children's heads off in front of their parents to get them to talk.
[01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:46.942]  This is the new freedom.
[01:23:47.723 --> 01:23:49.885]  Going back to our guest...
[01:23:51.308 --> 01:23:51.868]  Glenn Yadin.
[01:23:51.908 --> 01:23:54.590]  Glenn, let's go back to Nazi financiers, the funding.
[01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:58.873]  Where did all the billions in diamonds and gold and the rest of it go?
[01:23:58.893 --> 01:24:03.176]  We know a lot of it went to Switzerland, but a lot of it went to Central and South America and to the United States.
[01:24:03.216 --> 01:24:04.397]  Tell us about that part of your book.
[01:24:04.577 --> 01:24:12.062]  Okay, well, the best research on that was done by the Seagraves in their Gold Warriors book.
[01:24:12.843 --> 01:24:16.265]  That covered the Japanese treasure, the Golden Lily.
[01:24:17.826 --> 01:24:19.227]  Most of it, a lot of it,
[01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:24.302]  German gold ended up in Argentina.
[01:24:25.382 --> 01:24:35.884]  Martin Bormann started as early as 1943, spiriting German assets out of Germany into foreign countries.
[01:24:37.304 --> 01:24:45.546]  Not only did he spirit the gold out, he spirited patents and technicians out.
[01:24:48.986 --> 01:24:50.067]  Diamonds, art?
[01:24:50.547 --> 01:24:52.128]  Yeah, everything, basically.
[01:24:54.089 --> 01:25:09.655]  Once Hitler and the Germans knew that the war was lost, they sped it up and they allowed the SS to go ahead and carry their gold out, and a lot of it ended up invested in the U.S.
[01:25:09.695 --> 01:25:10.116]  companies.
[01:25:12.457 --> 01:25:13.637]  Let's go over some of that.
[01:25:16.406 --> 01:25:17.447]  Can you speak to some of that?
[01:25:17.467 --> 01:25:20.608]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:35.556]  It was invested through Argentina and the same two firms that were basically behind building Hitler's war machine, and that would be Sullivan and Cromwell and Brown Brothers and Harriman.
[01:25:36.276 --> 01:25:39.518]  A lot of the investments were arranged through them.
[01:25:41.194 --> 01:25:45.656]  And then, of course, also Thiessen, which you still see on most of the elevators.
[01:25:45.716 --> 01:25:48.417]  Thiessen was a big part of that, until they finally got busted.
[01:25:48.437 --> 01:25:52.199]  There was a little bit of a bust in 5051, wasn't there?
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:56.221]  Yeah.
[01:25:57.001 --> 01:26:00.143]  That came through Thiessen's bank in Holland.
[01:26:00.163 --> 01:26:10.007]  A lot of it filtered back through, back to Union Bank, which Prescott Bush was the director of.
[01:26:11.191 --> 01:26:17.635]  uh... basically he was uh... one of the uh... well Hitler's Baghdad really.
[01:26:17.655 --> 01:26:19.777]  He was on the board of directors, one of the chief people.
[01:26:20.317 --> 01:26:25.601]  You know, you were just researching World War II when you started discovering this as I and many others did.
[01:26:25.621 --> 01:26:28.863]  What was it like to discover this was part of the historical record?
[01:26:30.944 --> 01:26:32.545]  It was rather eye-opening.
[01:26:32.605 --> 01:26:40.110]  I thought I understood some of this but the more I researched the more I found the less I understand and even today
[01:26:40.768 --> 01:26:44.710]  There's a lot of stuff that I still don't have a full understanding of.
[01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:48.652]  What are some of the things that are just so amazing, they're enigmas?
[01:26:49.752 --> 01:27:00.478]  The amazing thing is, to me was, I got headlines from a couple of defunct New York papers during, I think it was the 36th election.
[01:27:01.978 --> 01:27:09.082]  They're headlining, one headlines, how the Republican Party hired no Nazis to manage their campaigns.
[01:27:11.006 --> 01:27:17.792]  The other one, the headline was that the Republican Party was financing the Nazi broadcasts out of New York.
[01:27:20.614 --> 01:27:28.300]  They couldn't have denied that they didn't know it was Nazi.
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:31.122]  I mean, Fritz Kuhn was one of the speakers.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.181]  Featured on the headline.
[01:27:33.341 --> 01:27:40.124]  In fact, in 1939, they had the huge Nazi party rally that filled Madison Square Garden.
[01:27:40.404 --> 01:27:40.705]  Yeah.
[01:27:43.126 --> 01:27:50.830]  And a lot of that, the other thing was the amount of Nazi intrigue in American elections during the 30s.
[01:27:54.412 --> 01:28:00.675]  During the 1940 election, Goring agreed to a front
[01:28:01.593 --> 01:28:05.314]  Five million dollars towards the election to defeat Roosevelt.
[01:28:07.334 --> 01:28:16.677]  Five million may not be much in the presidential campaign today, but at that time, it represented somewhere around a third of the total money spent in the election.
[01:28:17.317 --> 01:28:20.458]  A third of the money spent, an equivalent of about 50-60 million today.
[01:28:20.478 --> 01:28:20.738]  Yeah.
[01:28:22.018 --> 01:28:27.759]  And of course it would be even more because in the aggregate they didn't spend as much on elections then as they do now.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.100]  So it represents an even larger portion.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.100]  I agree with your analysis.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:31.980]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.801]  We'll get into any other facets of your book you'd like to discuss.
[01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:37.042]  And go to phone calls out there.
[01:28:37.782 --> 01:28:39.742]  Get to know the past, understand the future.
[01:28:40.302 --> 01:28:41.863]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[01:28:41.903 --> 01:28:42.323]  Check it out.
[01:28:43.943 --> 01:28:44.844]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.324 --> 01:28:46.924]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:50.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.979 --> 01:29:00.842]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:13.908]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.088 --> 01:29:15.889]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.069 --> 01:29:19.530]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:19.810 --> 01:29:23.592]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:23.852 --> 01:29:28.814]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[01:29:31.054 --> 01:29:35.016]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[01:29:55.944 --> 01:30:06.647]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:11.549]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:22.953]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.553 --> 01:30:30.398]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.798 --> 01:30:32.939]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.403]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[01:30:53.456 --> 01:30:53.827]  We're good.
[01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:56.231]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:58.272]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[01:30:58.472 --> 01:31:01.614]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:31:01.954 --> 01:31:02.514]  What did you do?
[01:31:02.634 --> 01:31:03.435]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:03.535 --> 01:31:04.275]  No, John.
[01:31:04.335 --> 01:31:05.516]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:05.796 --> 01:31:11.319]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:11.619 --> 01:31:17.863]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:18.203 --> 01:31:20.404]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:20.684 --> 01:31:22.005]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:31:24.346 --> 01:31:24.746]  Whoa!
[01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:26.347]  What was that website again?
[01:31:26.427 --> 01:31:29.929]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:31.330]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:35.772]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:35.912 --> 01:31:36.513]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:36.773 --> 01:31:37.973]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:38.374 --> 01:31:39.054]  Check, please.
[01:31:40.815 --> 01:31:42.276]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:31:42.756 --> 01:31:43.356]  Sure, John.
[01:31:43.576 --> 01:31:47.959]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:48.239 --> 01:31:49.940]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:50.340]  Deal.
[01:31:58.522 --> 01:31:59.523]  You know, I can't help it.
[01:31:59.603 --> 01:32:03.988]  I love to sing along with it.
[01:32:04.088 --> 01:32:07.392]  Another rag tag band.
[01:32:07.572 --> 01:32:08.994]  Declaring independence.
[01:32:09.394 --> 01:32:18.164]  The United States is not about shooting children in the head in front of their parents to make the parents answer questions.
[01:32:19.272 --> 01:32:19.933]  I don't think so.
[01:32:36.909 --> 01:32:39.771]  Freedom is not the military pension funds being looted.
[01:32:39.891 --> 01:32:44.493]  Freedom is not police in black riot gear, Darth Vader outfits stomping around.
[01:32:44.574 --> 01:32:48.036]  Freedom isn't a million four children grabbed by the government every year.
[01:32:48.376 --> 01:32:51.838]  Freedom isn't new freedom initiatives for forced drugging of half our population.
[01:32:52.258 --> 01:32:53.999]  Freedom isn't national ID cards.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.981]  They can try to claim it's freedom, but it isn't.
[01:32:58.262 --> 01:33:03.765]  And of course the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the Dutch Prince, the Crown Prince, was a Nazi general.
[01:33:04.836 --> 01:33:08.562]  And, uh, he was first a colonel in the SS, then became a general in the last months of the war.
[01:33:09.263 --> 01:33:12.048]  So we see this Nazi's thread running through things.
[01:33:12.088 --> 01:33:15.413]  And anybody that tries to deny it is living in la-la land.
[01:33:15.453 --> 01:33:16.174]  This is real.
[01:33:16.214 --> 01:33:16.996]  This is going on.
[01:33:18.308 --> 01:33:19.788]  We're going to take some calls here in a few minutes.
[01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:26.171]  We're talking to Glenn Yadin, author of the Nazi Hydra, and we have links to the web page that has the book available.
[01:33:26.211 --> 01:33:26.931]  It's an excellent book.
[01:33:26.951 --> 01:33:28.291]  I haven't read it all, but I've read quite a bit of it.
[01:33:28.711 --> 01:33:43.076]  The introduction, the preface in Chapter 1, what fascism is and isn't, is how it starts, and then it gets into Chapter 3, Corporate Law and History, Constitutional Law, Supreme Court cases, and Bibliography.
[01:33:44.036 --> 01:34:06.751]  It gets into Chapter 4, The Roaring Twenties and the Roots of Fascism in America, Chapter 5, The Thirties and Nazi Parading on Main Street, Chapter 6, The War Years, Chapter 7, A Pledge Betrayed, and then it just goes through Chapter 8, Nazi Gold, and the Ratlines, the CIA, and the Nazis, and it goes on and on.
[01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:12.133]  I want to take a few calls here, sir, but Glenn, give us a synopsis.
[01:34:12.493 --> 01:34:22.339]  Run through the history of the Nazis, the Nazis in America, and what the Nazi progeny are doing today and what their goals are.
[01:34:23.079 --> 01:34:26.321]  Well, it's basically coming down to corporate rule.
[01:34:28.223 --> 01:34:30.264]  The progeny wants to rule the world.
[01:34:33.985 --> 01:34:37.987]  The grandson of the progeny is in the Oval Office currently.
[01:34:40.688 --> 01:34:44.790]  The history of it was spread all throughout.
[01:34:46.591 --> 01:34:49.632]  It gets into almost every facet of life that there is.
[01:34:50.293 --> 01:34:57.156]  One of the sickest areas that I've found that it got into is child abuse through mind control.
[01:35:03.399 --> 01:35:19.125]  The betrayal chapter is probably pivotal because the Nazis did have a well-defined and well-financed comeback plan and it was depending on their supporters in the United States to help them out on that.
[01:35:20.506 --> 01:35:27.488]  Their plan basically involved trying to provoke a war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
[01:35:28.029 --> 01:35:31.210]  and while we were fighting each other
[01:35:32.277 --> 01:35:38.040]  We'd be too busy to interfere with the Nazis taking back over Germany.
[01:35:38.181 --> 01:35:51.788]  One of the last things Hitler told his secretary, and she's on record, and one of the last things he told an SS officer before he blew his own head off in the bunker there in Berlin, they said, who do we fight for after you're gone?
[01:35:51.828 --> 01:35:53.569]  He said, you fight for the coming man.
[01:35:53.649 --> 01:35:55.030]  He said, we're going to re-emerge.
[01:35:56.411 --> 01:35:58.432]  And regardless of whether that's happened or not,
[01:35:59.290 --> 01:36:02.292]  Bush has set up Homeland Security, that's what they called it in Nazi Germany.
[01:36:02.332 --> 01:36:04.173]  He's attacking the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[01:36:04.493 --> 01:36:06.474]  He is building emergency FEMA camps.
[01:36:06.834 --> 01:36:11.777]  They are brainwashing the pastors for, quote, gun confiscation and martial law.
[01:36:11.817 --> 01:36:14.819]  Big report out on that on PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:36:15.619 --> 01:36:23.841]  I mean, all the parallels to fascism, the corporate takeover, government handing over the assets to them, the global empire, the invasion of countries.
[01:36:24.241 --> 01:36:29.822]  It really is going on, but then you have the labor Zionists and the Israelis, though, tied into this, supporting it all.
[01:36:29.902 --> 01:36:31.863]  It's a very sick amalgamation.
[01:36:32.443 --> 01:36:38.324]  Yeah, it is, because if you look at it, some of the financing Hitler had came through Jewish channels.
[01:36:39.464 --> 01:36:41.645]  Warburg's and
[01:36:43.587 --> 01:36:45.928]  The Rothschilds were all involved in this.
[01:36:46.068 --> 01:36:47.188]  And this is all on the record.
[01:36:47.608 --> 01:37:03.654]  People need to understand that it is on the record that the Labor Zionist wrote magazine articles, the head of the Labor Zionist in Germany, supporting Hitler up until even 1942, and saying that they would not allow Jews to leave if they wouldn't go to Palestine.
[01:37:03.694 --> 01:37:05.274]  If they would, Hitler would let them go.
[01:37:05.594 --> 01:37:06.355]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:06.395 --> 01:37:10.596]  The Zionists were trying to promote travel to Israel.
[01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:20.491]  And our Palestine at the time, and they were supporting Hitler, basically forced all the other Jews into one choice.
[01:37:21.552 --> 01:37:26.776]  And even top Jewish scholars at major universities have documented this, and there's even some best-selling books on it now.
[01:37:26.836 --> 01:37:30.779]  So, as strange as it sounds, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:37:30.839 --> 01:37:31.739]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.583]  Well, there was actually one of the ones, the Zionists that promoted Hitler,
[01:37:37.313 --> 01:37:42.755]  And helped load the trains from Hungary, was actually hung in Israel later on after he immigrated.
[01:37:44.016 --> 01:37:44.756]  So it's on record.
[01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:46.417]  It's unbelievable.
[01:37:46.657 --> 01:37:52.780]  And now the very progeny of those Jews are some of Bush's top lieutenants.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.641]  I mean, the very grandsons, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:55.661 --> 01:38:00.063]  I mean, you couldn't write a fiction book this bizarre.
[01:38:00.163 --> 01:38:02.484]  No one would believe it, Mr. Yadin.
[01:38:02.884 --> 01:38:04.005]  Yeah.
[01:38:04.125 --> 01:38:05.966]  It's unbelievable what you find in there.
[01:38:07.245 --> 01:38:08.165]  It's all documented.
[01:38:10.887 --> 01:38:13.508]  How this stuff gets there.
[01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:27.274]  One of the things I am still working on is to figure out how some of these people that was in the army, in charge of the military government afterwards, how they got their position.
[01:38:27.314 --> 01:38:28.995]  Who assigned them that position?
[01:38:29.615 --> 01:38:35.257]  There was a Colonel Pope that was assigned to the decartelization of Germany.
[01:38:37.205 --> 01:38:46.167]  He was former, before he was in the Army, he was a director and executive officer of several IG Farben cartels.
[01:38:49.371 --> 01:38:53.314]  Unbelievable how he got assigned to that position to take apart a cartel when he was part of it.
[01:38:53.754 --> 01:38:58.678]  Well, we have one of the founders, one of the main members of Bohemian Grove, Thomas Watson, the owner of IBM.
[01:38:58.718 --> 01:39:00.239]  That's what the tattoos were for, folks.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.481]  Those numbers were entered into the IBM machines.
[01:39:02.921 --> 01:39:07.665]  IBM technicians were in the camps right through the war administering those computers.
[01:39:07.845 --> 01:39:08.406]  Exactly.
[01:39:09.807 --> 01:39:14.791]  When the troops landed on D-Day, Thomas Watson knew where every one of his machines were.
[01:39:16.355 --> 01:39:18.237]  Because they got updated.
[01:39:19.197 --> 01:39:26.984]  It's a big myth that the American corporations didn't have contact with their German branch during the war.
[01:39:27.104 --> 01:39:30.306]  Well, there were also hundreds of sites in Germany that were not allowed to be bombed.
[01:39:30.687 --> 01:39:40.495]  Ford plants, and of course the Opel plants, you have the GM plants, building the Panzers, the artillery shells, all of it, they couldn't bomb them!
[01:39:40.955 --> 01:39:44.718]  Exactly, because that was one of the things I touched on in the book.
[01:39:46.623 --> 01:39:55.025]  80% of the housing in Germany was destroyed, but at the end of the war, Germany still had 80% of its factory capacity left.
[01:39:56.746 --> 01:40:03.808]  Well, it's just like Vietnam where we weren't allowed to bomb Hanoi and the main industries, or couldn't bomb the ships bringing in weapons from China and Russia.
[01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:07.449]  This is a business, they want to keep it going as long as possible.
[01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.609]  Exactly.
[01:40:09.429 --> 01:40:11.430]  The Ford plant, actually in Cologne,
[01:40:12.342 --> 01:40:17.743]  Cologne was the first town with a thousand bombers launched against it.
[01:40:19.104 --> 01:40:24.625]  The only damage it ever had was an artillery shell through the roof in the final standoff.
[01:40:27.446 --> 01:40:28.606]  Unbelievable!
[01:40:29.506 --> 01:40:40.249]  The IT Farben office in Berlin was used by the Allies in the Occupation Army because it was fully intact.
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:44.840]  I don't think people realize this.
[01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:48.341]  What about occult aspects?
[01:40:48.361 --> 01:40:55.282]  We know the Nazis were heavy into the occult, that's mainstream admitted, and there was a big connection with the Nazis to Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones.
[01:40:56.042 --> 01:40:58.303]  We know German money actually founded Skull and Bones.
[01:40:58.323 --> 01:40:59.103]  You want to comment on that?
[01:41:01.583 --> 01:41:05.564]  Yes, I think the Skull and Bones is very deeply involved in it.
[01:41:05.704 --> 01:41:08.664]  It was through the Tools Society.
[01:41:10.785 --> 01:41:11.605]  I haven't really
[01:41:14.042 --> 01:41:18.444]  Dived into a lot of the religious or spiritual or whatever aspects of the Nazis.
[01:41:18.464 --> 01:41:21.446]  Well that's the thing, this is so wide, there's so many facets.
[01:41:21.846 --> 01:41:29.070]  Yeah, now there is a very good evidence that the Vatican Church was deeply involved with the Nazis.
[01:41:32.372 --> 01:41:41.037]  They were the ones that gave Hitler money before he came to power, the future Pope did.
[01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:45.318]  And they set up the rat lines afterwards.
[01:41:46.058 --> 01:41:46.978]  No question on that.
[01:41:47.979 --> 01:41:49.440]  No question on that.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.600]  Let's take a few calls.
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:42:00.065]  They'll be all over the map, but it all speaks to fascism, what Mussolini said should probably be termed corporatism, which I say should be properly termed modern neo-mercantilism.
[01:42:00.505 --> 01:42:02.526]  Let's go ahead and go back to Ron in New York.
[01:42:02.606 --> 01:42:06.768]  Ron, go ahead and finish up, then we'll go to James, Brooke, Joe, David, and others.
[01:42:06.808 --> 01:42:07.109]  Go ahead.
[01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.889]  You're on the air, Ron.
[01:42:10.529 --> 01:42:12.490]  He's got his radio on in the background.
[01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:14.891]  Put him on hold, he'll be ready in a few minutes.
[01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:16.852]  Let's go to James in Maryland.
[01:42:16.892 --> 01:42:18.252]  James, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:42:18.272 --> 01:42:29.377]  Hello, I was wondering if you could speak to the media's complicity in hiding all these things for decades from the American people?
[01:42:29.986 --> 01:42:31.207]  And I'll take my answer out there.
[01:42:31.367 --> 01:42:31.887]  Well, thank you.
[01:42:31.907 --> 01:42:42.835]  If you know where to look, you can find it in mainstream news, but you're right, it never hits the big news cycle like Michael Jackson or some other stupid thing, some girl kidnapped in Aruba does.
[01:42:43.135 --> 01:42:45.457]  Comments there for the listener?
[01:42:49.159 --> 01:42:56.024]  The Hearst newspaper chain actually hired Mussolini to write a column for him.
[01:42:56.044 --> 01:42:58.526]  He turned around after getting Mussolini signed up
[01:42:59.113 --> 01:43:00.613]  Tried to sign up Hitler as well.
[01:43:02.394 --> 01:43:07.956]  Hitler wouldn't write the article or the column, but he did make a deal with Hearst.
[01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:16.999]  And once Hearst had the deal, his paper became pro-Nazi to the extreme.
[01:43:17.739 --> 01:43:23.681]  Almost all the major chains, newspaper chains, during the 30s and 40s, early 40s,
[01:43:25.126 --> 01:43:27.427]  We're pro-Nazi.
[01:43:27.467 --> 01:43:32.410]  The Patterson chain, the McCormick chain, it was all taking the fascists' lives.
[01:43:32.671 --> 01:43:33.631]  Even the loose chain.
[01:43:34.172 --> 01:43:39.935]  In Dallas, my grandfather, he told the story, lived across the street growing up in high school.
[01:43:40.956 --> 01:43:42.477]  Then of course, World War II came.
[01:43:43.137 --> 01:43:47.440]  But he knew, even before the war, one of the inventors of air conditioning.
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:49.701]  And the guy was extremely rich.
[01:43:49.821 --> 01:43:51.202]  Obviously, he was a German-American.
[01:43:51.838 --> 01:43:57.423]  And they're pure German folks, and the Nazis sucked every dime out of him or threatened to kill his family in Germany.
[01:43:57.463 --> 01:44:03.508]  So for all the sickos out there that act like Hitler's some hero and fought the New World Order, you're totally full of baloney.
[01:44:03.908 --> 01:44:11.955]  I have this directly from my grandfather, and my grandfather even did some work for this man, and how they sucked him dry.
[01:44:12.856 --> 01:44:15.458]  And they did that type of extortion all over the country, didn't they?
[01:44:15.839 --> 01:44:17.320]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:44:18.104 --> 01:44:22.387]  They were exploiting German-Americans for everything they could get out of them.
[01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:31.574]  Most of the German-Americans tried to stay loyal to America, but there were a few that turned over.
[01:44:32.535 --> 01:44:38.579]  My grandfather saw some of that just because he was a German-American and witnessed some of that.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.521]  Let's take another call.
[01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:42.202]  Let's go back and see if Ron's there now.
[01:44:42.322 --> 01:44:43.143]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:44:43.183 --> 01:44:43.483]  Go ahead.
[01:44:45.504 --> 01:44:46.224]  Okay, he's not there.
[01:44:46.244 --> 01:44:46.965]  We've got to let him go.
[01:44:46.985 --> 01:44:49.326]  I can hear the radio on in the background.
[01:44:49.386 --> 01:44:52.728]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Texas.
[01:44:52.808 --> 01:44:53.688]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:44:53.748 --> 01:44:54.068]  Welcome.
[01:44:54.528 --> 01:44:55.049]  How are you doing?
[01:44:55.369 --> 01:44:55.609]  Good.
[01:44:55.829 --> 01:45:00.551]  I actually called in to speak about something I heard on KTRH in Houston the other day.
[01:45:00.571 --> 01:45:00.852]  That's okay.
[01:45:00.872 --> 01:45:01.212]  Go ahead.
[01:45:01.592 --> 01:45:03.033]  But first of all, a comment.
[01:45:03.073 --> 01:45:04.333]  My father was in World War II.
[01:45:04.433 --> 01:45:07.875]  I had two other uncles in World War II.
[01:45:08.776 --> 01:45:11.597]  If they knew what they fought for and what they did,
[01:45:12.871 --> 01:45:16.874]  I've asked my uncle this and sometimes they wonder, you know, why they did it.
[01:45:17.495 --> 01:45:22.378]  Seeing what's happened and your guest book is, I looked it up on the website, looks very interesting.
[01:45:22.799 --> 01:45:35.548]  I was in Houston for a funeral over the weekend and on Monday the funeral, I woke up to KTRH because I'd been listening to Coast to Coast the night before and the first thing I heard on the radio was a big report about the new immunization shot
[01:45:36.215 --> 01:45:36.755]  I think so.
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.641]  And they're talking about trying to make it mandatory.
[01:45:53.661 --> 01:45:56.262]  There are like 35 vaccines they try to make you take.
[01:45:56.822 --> 01:45:58.723]  And all of these are very, very dangerous.
[01:45:59.063 --> 01:46:00.624]  And KTRH was all over it.
[01:46:00.684 --> 01:46:04.046]  They had a doctor come on from the medical center down there in Houston.
[01:46:04.186 --> 01:46:05.827]  And they were just glowing about this.
[01:46:05.867 --> 01:46:09.428]  Well, folks, you know that it is a radiated cancer virus.
[01:46:09.568 --> 01:46:11.909]  And that stuff is still able to infect you.
[01:46:11.929 --> 01:46:16.331]  And if you give it to your daughter, you'll wonder why in five years she dies of cancer.
[01:46:16.351 --> 01:46:16.771]  But go ahead.
[01:46:16.812 --> 01:46:17.452]  Kill your children.
[01:46:17.492 --> 01:46:17.792]  Go ahead.
[01:46:18.012 --> 01:46:31.204]  Well, I just wanted to let you know that, you know, it's Clear Channel and they're, you know, you know they're on the team and the opposite team and just want to let you know that that report was... Well, call into those talk shows and say, yeah, I heard that news.
[01:46:31.224 --> 01:46:33.326]  You know, these vaccines are really dangerous.
[01:46:33.346 --> 01:46:35.268]  Well, I'm in Austin.
[01:46:35.768 --> 01:46:36.349]  No, I understand.
[01:46:36.369 --> 01:46:37.590]  You know what happens a lot of time?
[01:46:38.996 --> 01:46:43.079]  There's actually money being paid to stations to run news reports, but they're not really news reports.
[01:46:43.099 --> 01:46:43.860]  They're paid for.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.882]  You want to comment on Big Pharma?
[01:46:45.922 --> 01:46:49.464]  That's tied into the Nazis as well, Mr. Yadin.
[01:46:49.725 --> 01:46:51.326]  Right.
[01:46:51.626 --> 01:46:56.590]  Almost all your pharma is tied back to IG Pharma.
[01:46:57.431 --> 01:46:58.572]  They was the big firm.
[01:47:00.173 --> 01:47:02.575]  The Germans was leading the chemistry industry at the time.
[01:47:02.615 --> 01:47:03.376]  Bayer, all of them.
[01:47:03.816 --> 01:47:03.996]  Yep.
[01:47:04.797 --> 01:47:07.039]  Bayer... Well, IG Pharma was...
[01:47:09.208 --> 01:47:14.633]  It's unbelievable.
[01:47:15.153 --> 01:47:16.955]  Anything else there, Joe?
[01:47:17.175 --> 01:47:18.516]  I look forward to reading this material.
[01:47:18.536 --> 01:47:23.020]  It looks very interesting and it's what we've known all along.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.142]  It's just a good organization, it looks like.
[01:47:25.442 --> 01:47:25.822]  Thank you.
[01:47:25.862 --> 01:47:26.883]  I appreciate the call.
[01:47:27.984 --> 01:47:29.485]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave.
[01:47:29.505 --> 01:47:30.706]  Dave, where are you calling us from?
[01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:35.891]  David, you're not there.
[01:47:35.911 --> 01:47:35.991]  Okay.
[01:47:37.374 --> 01:47:39.174]  Let's go ahead and talk to Laura in Texas.
[01:47:39.214 --> 01:47:39.955]  Laura, go ahead.
[01:47:40.915 --> 01:47:41.175]  Alex?
[01:47:41.515 --> 01:47:41.755]  Yes.
[01:47:42.855 --> 01:47:44.776]  I have something to talk about.
[01:47:46.056 --> 01:47:47.876]  Have you ever heard of Hugo Turetti?
[01:47:47.916 --> 01:47:56.678]  He was a psychiatrist who invented electroshock, and he was practicing in fascist Italy, by the way, when he invented that.
[01:47:56.718 --> 01:47:58.518]  Yeah, the Nazis were real into that too, yeah.
[01:47:59.318 --> 01:48:04.560]  Lobotomies, sterilization, it's all the same stuff we hear out of the Dr. Piankas of the world.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:06.760]  Yes, because
[01:48:07.259 --> 01:48:14.861]  I mean, electroshock causes brain damage, and it actually has been shown to lower IQs.
[01:48:14.941 --> 01:48:16.401]  Well, of course it does.
[01:48:16.441 --> 01:48:20.882]  They run high voltage across the cerebral lobes, the cerebral cortex.
[01:48:20.942 --> 01:48:24.243]  But listen, that happens to tens of thousands of Americans a year, and it's horrible.
[01:48:24.463 --> 01:48:29.085]  It's nothing compared to two-thirds plus of foster children on an average of seven drugs.
[01:48:29.625 --> 01:48:30.685]  The drugs do the same thing.
[01:48:31.846 --> 01:48:45.954]  Yeah, I've also heard a psychiatrist speaking on 60 Minutes and he actually claimed that some people benefit from having their IQs lowered and you wonder what kind of interest those psychiatrists might be
[01:48:47.119 --> 01:48:49.900]  How big a part did psychiatry play in Nazi Germany, sir?
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.041]  There was a large part of it.
[01:49:15.834 --> 01:49:21.656]  The brainwashing to keep everybody in line was probably the biggest part of their job.
[01:49:22.716 --> 01:49:27.178]  Well, the Germans spent massive amounts of money, not just on propaganda, but what they call mind science.
[01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:27.738]  Uh-huh.
[01:49:28.758 --> 01:49:30.139]  Yeah, we were using that.
[01:49:30.459 --> 01:49:39.062]  A lot of the German scientists that was brought into this country were mind scientists or mind control.
[01:49:40.279 --> 01:49:43.120]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with our final segment for our guest.
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:45.961]  We'll cover news and take a lot of calls in the third hour.
[01:49:46.281 --> 01:49:47.002]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:47.022 --> 01:49:47.422]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.265 --> 01:49:57.106]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.868 --> 01:49:59.150]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.350 --> 01:50:05.098]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.378 --> 01:50:10.645]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:10.926 --> 01:50:12.548]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[01:50:12.688 --> 01:50:14.189]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:50.352 --> 01:50:52.434]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.758 --> 01:50:57.641]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.881 --> 01:51:03.326]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.586 --> 01:51:13.974]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:18.458]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.658 --> 01:51:19.439]  We're good to go!
[01:51:47.597 --> 01:51:48.237]  I think so.
[01:52:10.405 --> 01:52:11.066]  We're good to go.

[01:52:53.624 --> 01:52:55.445]  In the third hour,
[01:53:24.053 --> 01:53:26.375]  I've got a giant stack of news here I'm going to cover.
[01:53:27.356 --> 01:53:38.203]  And I want to discuss with you, the listeners, the tape we played of Army Ranger Jesse McBeth talking about how they kill children in front of their parents to get them to answer questions.
[01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:43.047]  Now this is again in the White House memos and legal opinions, so we know that they've ordered it.
[01:53:44.088 --> 01:53:47.010]  But this makes the Abu Ghraib torture look like nothing.
[01:53:47.862 --> 01:53:48.802]  So we'll be going over that.
[01:53:48.822 --> 01:53:52.824]  We'll also play a clip of the type of propaganda that's being pushed.
[01:53:52.844 --> 01:54:11.831]  And then some good news with Lou Dobbs admitting the Oslon movement trying to take over the United States, which strangely enough, again, the Nazis really set up back in World War I, they cooked this up, tried to implement the plan of San Diego to have Mexicans attack the Southwest.
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.981]  They did get it launched in 1918.
[01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:27.508]  By the way, I've only read a few chapters of your book, it's excellent, but does your book get into how the Nazis in World War I and II, and I know there were Nazis in World War II folks, I know the Nazis weren't founded until the 20s, but the same crowd, the same mindset.
[01:54:27.768 --> 01:54:32.911]  Were you aware, sir, that they actually successfully got Mexicans to launch attacks on the U.S.?
[01:54:32.931 --> 01:54:34.492]  No, I wasn't on that.
[01:54:34.912 --> 01:54:36.553]  It's called the Plan of San Diego.
[01:54:37.705 --> 01:54:39.366]  Might be an interesting area of research for you.
[01:54:39.726 --> 01:54:41.107]  May I make one more comment on that?
[01:54:41.127 --> 01:54:42.188]  Am I in control?
[01:54:42.228 --> 01:54:42.848]  Before I forget it?
[01:54:42.908 --> 01:54:43.608]  Yes, let's do that.
[01:54:44.749 --> 01:54:53.594]  You know, the Nazis used fluoride in the water for the concentration camps because they believed that it pacified inmates.
[01:54:57.817 --> 01:54:58.477]  Please continue.
[01:54:59.057 --> 01:54:59.978]  That was it, right there.
[01:55:00.718 --> 01:55:02.119]  I mean, and then what do we do?
[01:55:02.159 --> 01:55:03.120]  We adopt fluoride?
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:05.201]  Or fluoridation?
[01:55:06.198 --> 01:55:30.385]  Actually, Edward Bernays, the father of public relations, wrote in his own book, he wrote two of them, but in one book he mentioned, it's in my new film, that he headed up the PR campaign to put the poison in the water, and it's even in mainstream World War II history books, that the Nazis did indeed use stannous fluoride as a cumulative toxic sedative.
[01:55:30.765 --> 01:55:32.185]  Uh-huh, yeah, a pacifier.
[01:55:32.205 --> 01:55:34.906]  The reason I was getting at it,
[01:55:35.550 --> 01:55:43.797]  That was because, well, if you remember the 60s, if Nixon did any of this stuff that Bush has done, we would have hung him from the Oval Office.
[01:55:44.818 --> 01:55:49.722]  But for some reason, everybody seems pacified at this point in time.
[01:55:50.082 --> 01:55:52.525]  Well, there's a lot of factors, but fluoride's a big one.
[01:55:52.625 --> 01:55:54.306]  Sir, I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:55:54.346 --> 01:55:57.589]  You're Glenn Yadin, author of The Nazi Hydra in America.
[01:55:57.929 --> 01:56:01.752]  We have links to your publisher where folks can get the book, and we look forward to talking to you in the future.
[01:56:02.353 --> 01:56:02.693]  Thank you.
[01:56:03.053 --> 01:56:03.554]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:04.326 --> 01:56:05.386]  He's done great research.
[01:56:06.347 --> 01:56:15.089]  Before I end this hour and come back and take a bunch of calls and then get into more news and play these audio clips, I want to encourage you to stop waiting.
[01:56:15.149 --> 01:56:16.849]  We need to expose these murderers now.
[01:56:16.949 --> 01:56:26.851]  In Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, my book Descent to Tyranny, my books and videos that I've written and published and the films I've made are the best out there.
[01:56:27.432 --> 01:56:28.952]  Many listeners and viewers agree.
[01:56:29.868 --> 01:56:36.131]  That seems to be the consensus, and I hope you'll get my videos and make copies of them, give them to people, know it's having a huge effect.
[01:56:36.652 --> 01:56:37.952]  We can stop these people.
[01:56:37.972 --> 01:56:39.853]  Stuff's going to be bad in this country, that's clear.
[01:56:40.374 --> 01:56:43.595]  It's going to get worse, but how bad will it get is up to you.
[01:56:43.715 --> 01:56:45.156]  We can back these people off.
[01:56:45.957 --> 01:56:51.940]  They're totally freaked out right now that national polls show a majority believe the government's covering up or was involved in 9-11.
[01:56:53.567 --> 01:56:54.667]  They're having to respond.
[01:56:55.147 --> 01:56:56.308]  We've got them off balance.
[01:56:56.348 --> 01:56:58.428]  They know that we're not buying into what they're doing.
[01:56:59.028 --> 01:57:00.068]  This is life and death.
[01:57:00.188 --> 01:57:00.968]  Get the videos.

[01:57:38.211 --> 01:57:38.491]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.178 --> 01:57:52.259]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.959 --> 01:57:54.040]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.701 --> 01:57:55.521]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.282 --> 01:57:57.202]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.863 --> 01:58:01.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.026 --> 01:58:06.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.831 --> 01:58:11.713]  We are now into hour number three.
[01:58:13.237 --> 01:58:15.198]  I want to take a lot of your calls in this third hour.
[01:58:15.218 --> 01:58:18.119]  We're going to go through them quickly and in rapid succession.
[01:58:18.719 --> 01:58:20.200]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:34.806]  I've seen a lot of independent articles where reporters have sat right next to US and British troops as they shoot women in the head, as they walk with their child.
[01:58:35.567 --> 01:58:39.328]  We have the reports confirmed, the Army's own report of raping and torturing of children.
[01:58:40.009 --> 01:58:40.729]  We have the
[01:58:42.831 --> 01:58:44.636]  White House memos that get into all of this.
[01:58:44.696 --> 01:58:45.739]  We know that's confirmed.
[01:58:45.759 --> 01:58:50.009]  We've been playing a clip that's been reported to be Jesse McBeth in Army Ranger.
[01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:55.930]  Talking about how they shoot people and torture people basically to get them to answer questions in those nighttime raids.
[01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:59.571]  And we know some of this has gone on, but we're looking into it being a fake.
[01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:03.612]  Steve Watson just instant messaged me and said that there's some evidence it could be.
[01:59:03.992 --> 01:59:06.232]  Probably put out by the government to then discredit everything else.
[01:59:06.292 --> 01:59:07.813]  It's called a honeypot, they'll do that.
[01:59:08.393 --> 01:59:10.933]  But we know what's going on in Iraq, but I hope it's a fake.
[01:59:11.334 --> 01:59:12.554]  I hope things aren't this bad.
[01:59:13.974 --> 01:59:17.075]  I certainly hope that's the case, but I'm not convinced of that.
[01:59:18.548 --> 01:59:20.069]  They tell us everything's an urban legend.
[01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:24.070]  I mean, the White House says it's an urban legend that they ever said there were WMDs in Iraq.
[01:59:24.951 --> 01:59:25.711]  But we know the truth.
[01:59:26.151 --> 01:59:35.355]  We're going to get into Iran, the new developments there, a bunch of new scientific developments, the new hurricane report for this year, and so much more.
[01:59:36.096 --> 01:59:38.056]  But right now, let's go to Nick in New York.
[01:59:38.116 --> 01:59:38.897]  Nick, thanks for holding.
[01:59:38.937 --> 01:59:39.217]  Welcome.
[01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:40.590]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:59:40.670 --> 01:59:47.273]  I just want to say that, you know, you're doing a great job, and I credit you personally for waking me up to the hidden truth behind 9-11 and the New World Order.
[01:59:47.453 --> 01:59:48.714]  Well, I'm honored.
[01:59:48.734 --> 01:59:49.074]  Thank you.
[01:59:49.894 --> 01:59:56.137]  What I'm wondering is, if you plan on doing a 9-11 truth symposium in New York maybe next year, seeing as how you're doing one in L.A.
[01:59:56.157 --> 01:59:59.558]  this year, maybe you could do, like, an annual thing and come to New York next year.
[02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:04.589]  Also, my other question is, have you seen Aaron Russo's film, Freedom to Fascism?
[02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.910]  What are your thoughts on it?
[02:00:06.171 --> 02:00:07.312]  No, I know Aaron Russo.
[02:00:07.332 --> 02:00:08.953]  I've supported and promoted his new film.
[02:00:08.993 --> 02:00:09.753]  I've seen the trailer.
[02:00:09.773 --> 02:00:15.858]  I didn't attend it a few months ago when they showed it in Austin, but I certainly support it.
[02:00:15.998 --> 02:00:19.721]  And as for a 9-11 conference, I may never have another one.
[02:00:19.821 --> 02:00:21.062]  I might, but probably not.
[02:00:21.743 --> 02:00:22.263]  Oh, come on.
[02:00:22.303 --> 02:00:23.404]  You've got to come to New York.
[02:00:23.504 --> 02:00:24.184]  We need you right here.
[02:00:24.204 --> 02:00:28.828]  I know, but if I just globetrot, which is what everybody else does, I won't get all the work done.
[02:00:29.702 --> 02:00:32.724]  I know, I know, but you've got to come to the epicenter of 9-11.
[02:00:33.004 --> 02:00:35.646]  Well, I've been to New York twice since 9-11.
[02:00:35.666 --> 02:00:36.687]  I've been to Ground Zero.
[02:00:37.047 --> 02:00:38.608]  I made a film about it, Martial Law.
[02:00:39.829 --> 02:00:40.969]  But I'd love to meet you, sir.
[02:00:40.989 --> 02:00:41.830]  I'd love to come to New York.
[02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.971]  Why don't you come to L.A.?
[02:00:43.011 --> 02:00:44.452]  Why don't you come to L.A.?
[02:00:44.992 --> 02:00:47.434]  I would, but I'm only a law school student.
[02:00:47.454 --> 02:00:48.094]  I don't have the funds.
[02:00:48.114 --> 02:00:49.275]  I understand, my friend.
[02:00:50.037 --> 02:00:51.618]  But thank you again, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:00:51.898 --> 02:00:52.198]  You bet.
[02:00:52.238 --> 02:00:52.618]  Thank you.
[02:00:52.639 --> 02:00:53.779]  I appreciate those comments.
[02:00:54.359 --> 02:00:56.040]  Let's talk to Kevin in Mass.
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:56.801]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:00:56.861 --> 02:00:57.201]  Go ahead.
[02:00:57.721 --> 02:00:58.102]  Hi.
[02:00:58.142 --> 02:00:59.142]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:00:59.883 --> 02:01:01.483]  And thank you for today's topic.
[02:01:01.544 --> 02:01:03.425]  I had a couple of quick questions.
[02:01:03.465 --> 02:01:11.829]  I wanted to touch on Reinhardt, Galen, and the CIA, and Demore and Scheldt, who handled Oswald's connections with the Nazis.
[02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:18.113]  And if anyone has any doubts about the effect of these Nazis coming in,
[02:01:18.982 --> 02:01:35.891]  Having great effect right now in today's politics, I'd ask them to Google or Yahoo or search somehow on the Navy SEAL base in San Diego called the SEAL's Lair, which the aerial photographs of look like the whole base is formed in one large swastika.
[02:01:35.971 --> 02:01:37.652]  It's a perfect swastika.
[02:01:39.593 --> 02:01:41.434]  It's nothing to be alarmed about.
[02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:45.015]  It's just a coincidence and anyone who thinks differently must be crazy.
[02:01:46.996 --> 02:01:47.857]  Well, what we know
[02:01:49.033 --> 02:01:50.813]  People think it can't happen here, but it can if they let it.
[02:02:19.475 --> 02:02:20.776]  Look at what's happening every day.
[02:02:20.856 --> 02:02:21.457]  I agree with you.
[02:02:21.537 --> 02:02:22.237]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:22.978 --> 02:02:24.299]  More calls on the other side.
[02:02:24.319 --> 02:02:28.182]  We're going to take a whole bunch of them.
[02:02:28.202 --> 02:02:28.502]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:29.343 --> 02:02:37.870]  I want to take 20 calls in the next hour and cover a large spectrum cross-section of the news, but I love to hear whatever topics and angles and news items you bring up.
[02:02:38.230 --> 02:02:39.071]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:39.131 --> 02:02:39.871]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:39.891 --> 02:02:43.094]  This is Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:02:46.812 --> 02:02:49.674]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.935 --> 02:02:51.496]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.856 --> 02:02:56.540]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:03:03.626]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.926 --> 02:03:05.907]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.107 --> 02:03:08.948]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:13.709]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.909 --> 02:03:18.310]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.570 --> 02:03:25.773]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.033 --> 02:03:28.453]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.613 --> 02:03:30.394]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:03:30.414 --> 02:03:30.474]  1-888-253-3139
[02:03:35.475 --> 02:03:48.698]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:49.018 --> 02:03:51.798]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:52.078 --> 02:03:56.219]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.639 --> 02:03:57.479]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.799 --> 02:04:02.360]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.847 --> 02:04:04.968]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.469 --> 02:04:20.159]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:27.324]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:27.624 --> 02:04:30.766]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:32.447 --> 02:04:34.529]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:35.310]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:36.892]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.723 --> 02:04:51.707]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[02:04:52.107 --> 02:04:54.769]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:54.929 --> 02:04:59.552]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[02:04:59.712 --> 02:05:04.536]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[02:05:04.716 --> 02:05:09.459]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[02:05:09.679 --> 02:05:12.341]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:12.581 --> 02:05:15.483]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[02:05:16.743 --> 02:05:17.764]  Looking for profits?
[02:05:17.824 --> 02:05:19.204]  Looking for safety and security?
[02:05:19.565 --> 02:05:22.766]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:05:22.806 --> 02:05:30.089]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[02:05:30.449 --> 02:05:33.970]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:35.711]  Secure your position today.
[02:05:36.011 --> 02:05:37.191]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:37.271 --> 02:05:37.511]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:45.836 --> 02:05:51.497]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.698 --> 02:05:58.059]  We're rampaging, blitzing through your calls in this third hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:05:58.079 --> 02:06:06.641]  I'm going to go through your calls very quickly, then I'm going to get more into Iran, what this war could look like.
[02:06:07.021 --> 02:06:13.042]  Then some interesting technology news, Japan boffins build breakthrough brain-machine interface.
[02:06:14.327 --> 02:06:15.508]  And a lot more.
[02:06:16.208 --> 02:06:19.190]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York.
[02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.970]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:21.351]  It's been a couple of years, Alex.
[02:06:21.471 --> 02:06:22.192]  How are you doing?
[02:06:22.352 --> 02:06:23.092]  Good.
[02:06:23.432 --> 02:06:24.093]  Welcome to the show.
[02:06:24.113 --> 02:06:24.933]  Nice talking to you again.
[02:06:24.993 --> 02:06:27.214]  You know, Lou Dobbs, he's so exasperated.
[02:06:27.555 --> 02:06:34.338]  He's the only one reporting the things that are really happening in the right way and everything he's taking.
[02:06:34.358 --> 02:06:35.959]  But he's exasperated.
[02:06:35.979 --> 02:06:37.440]  He says, I don't know what's going on.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.201]  It's terrible.
[02:06:39.561 --> 02:06:41.222]  They're crazy, etc.
[02:06:41.362 --> 02:06:42.383]  You know, paraphrasing.
[02:06:43.734 --> 02:06:51.839]  Who is he and why isn't he really, he's not allowed to really state what is actually taking place, what you're saying and others are saying.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.101]  Well, I can look at O'Reilly.
[02:06:55.201 --> 02:06:58.984]  I knew back eight years ago he would do shows in the New World Order, the Illuminati.
[02:06:59.644 --> 02:07:02.966]  His ratings exploded, he went from nothing to something.
[02:07:03.026 --> 02:07:07.649]  Then, the last three years he's turned into a total neocon, now he's lost popularity.
[02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:11.692]  Okay, so what's happened with Lou Dobbs and even Oberman
[02:07:12.817 --> 02:07:16.420]  They've gotten top ratings because they'll talk about real issues.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:20.224]  They'll expose the NSA chief as a liar, now to be the CIA chief.
[02:07:20.704 --> 02:07:22.246]  They'll talk about the open borders.
[02:07:23.166 --> 02:07:30.253]  And Dobbs, you know, went into the corporate world, had some trouble during the dot-com bust, came back out, went to CNN.
[02:07:30.893 --> 02:07:33.035]  You can tell he is not a pure elitist.
[02:07:33.055 --> 02:07:34.337]  You can really look at him.
[02:07:34.697 --> 02:07:35.738]  It's not acting, I can tell.
[02:07:37.293 --> 02:07:39.575]  He is trying to get away with as much as he can.
[02:07:39.956 --> 02:07:41.297]  You can tell he's on a short leash.
[02:07:41.317 --> 02:07:42.959]  You can tell he wants to say a lot more.
[02:07:42.979 --> 02:07:47.103]  And you can tell whenever he has to have the other side on some Mexican
[02:07:48.933 --> 02:07:51.936]  Ambassador up there lying that he can't stand it.
[02:07:52.556 --> 02:08:00.003]  But more than that, CNN allows him to tell a little bit of the truth because they know that's where the American people are.
[02:08:00.563 --> 02:08:04.106]  They're being forced to do this or lose all credibility.
[02:08:04.566 --> 02:08:10.631]  They are no longer even part of the game, no longer even matter if they don't do this.
[02:08:10.711 --> 02:08:15.395]  Anyone that doesn't talk about real issues is basically being ignored.
[02:08:15.435 --> 02:08:17.397]  In fact, would you like me to play that Lou Dobbs clip?
[02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.329]  Sure.
[02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:20.111]  Okay, Ron, thanks for the call.
[02:08:20.171 --> 02:08:21.111]  It was good hearing from you.
[02:08:21.572 --> 02:08:28.297]  This is from CNN last night as he talks about Vicente Fox up in Utah.
[02:08:29.218 --> 02:08:33.081]  And again, I'm not here attacking Mormons, folks, but give me a break.
[02:08:33.521 --> 02:08:36.003]  The Mormon Church is promoting the New World Order.
[02:08:36.698 --> 02:08:38.739]  They're promoting everything Bush is doing.
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:41.061]  Senator Hatch promotes a draft.
[02:08:41.541 --> 02:08:43.602]  Promotes all these police state measures.
[02:08:43.642 --> 02:08:45.103]  He's promoted gun control.
[02:08:45.503 --> 02:08:48.885]  He's promoted bills, federally, to give free tuition to illegal aliens.
[02:08:49.285 --> 02:08:50.186]  Social Security.
[02:08:50.366 --> 02:08:50.946]  All of this.
[02:08:52.607 --> 02:08:59.551]  And openly, Salt Lake City, even though it's very conservative, is advertising itself as a haven city.
[02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:01.873]  And that's why Fox went there.
[02:09:02.433 --> 02:09:03.774]  And so here is this piece about it.
[02:09:03.834 --> 02:09:04.474]  But then, then,
[02:09:06.403 --> 02:09:13.711]  On top of all of this, Lou Dobbs' reporter admits the whole Oslon takeover plan, they say some radicals are involved in it.
[02:09:13.731 --> 02:09:14.972]  No, it's not some radicals.
[02:09:15.573 --> 02:09:21.118]  I'd have to say of the Reconquistas, about 80% are La Raza, Mecha, or the Mexico movement.
[02:09:21.719 --> 02:09:26.324]  And man, I've been to their rallies, I've been to their websites, we've had them on, we've played clips.
[02:09:27.434 --> 02:09:30.715]  Of Jose Gutierrez, UT Chicano studied, Arlington.
[02:09:31.155 --> 02:09:33.656]  I mean they say that all whites must be killed.
[02:09:33.716 --> 02:09:36.017]  It was all white males 16 and older.
[02:09:36.077 --> 02:09:39.378]  Now all of us must die and the media is covering this up.
[02:09:39.418 --> 02:09:46.580]  Can you imagine if the media made it in the nightly news that the leaders of the Chicano movement are saying all whites must die?
[02:09:47.406 --> 02:10:05.007]  And this is slandering great Hispanic Americans who are very patriotic and even some of these illegal aliens who don't have this view aren't complete maniacs but they have bullied and through pride whipped a lot of these people into supporting this and I mean it is a racial surge just like the globalists used the Nazis to break down America.
[02:10:05.347 --> 02:10:07.550]  So go ahead and play this Lou Dobbs clip and we'll go back to your calls.
[02:10:08.383 --> 02:10:17.246]  Utah's dominant religion, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, teaches that a lost tribe of Israelites are the ancestors of indigenous people in Latin America.
[02:10:17.607 --> 02:10:23.489]  Mormons have converted a million Mexicans to their faith, and many welcome them to Utah with no regard for legal status.
[02:10:24.029 --> 02:10:27.470]  Utah's Minutemen plan to protest Fox's presence in their state.
[02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:34.393]  It seems the only thing he does is continue to push people towards America to help offset
[02:10:35.214 --> 02:10:37.536]  The cost of these people in his country.
[02:10:38.256 --> 02:10:44.801]  And he hasn't really come up with an economic plan in Mexico to help alleviate those very problems.
[02:10:45.041 --> 02:10:49.705]  It's estimated Utah has about 100,000 illegal aliens and the number is growing rapidly.
[02:10:50.145 --> 02:10:55.129]  Utah is also a part of the territory some militant Latino activists refer to as Oslon.
[02:10:55.409 --> 02:10:58.952]  The portion of the Southwest United States they claim rightfully belongs to Mexico.
[02:11:00.347 --> 02:11:03.168]  You could call this the Vicente Fox Aslan Tour.
[02:11:03.468 --> 02:11:11.310]  Since the three states he'll visit, Utah, Washington, and California, are all part of some radical group's vision of the mythical indigenous homeland.
[02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:12.151]  Lou?
[02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:13.971]  Casey, thank you very much.
[02:11:14.852 --> 02:11:24.835]  I was just struck by the idea that the Church of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon Church, seems to be looking south just as avidly and
[02:11:26.475 --> 02:11:32.138]  And aggressively, as the Catholic Church, to add a few folks to those pews.
[02:11:32.859 --> 02:11:33.379]  Absolutely.
[02:11:33.439 --> 02:11:37.101]  As we reported, a million Mormons now in the country of Mexico.
[02:11:37.121 --> 02:11:41.503]  It's one of the fastest growing, in fact, not the fastest growing religious group in the country.
[02:11:41.523 --> 02:11:43.904]  The Mormon Church has opened 12 temples there, Lou.
[02:11:44.725 --> 02:11:45.785]  That's aggressive indeed.
[02:11:46.126 --> 02:11:48.087]  Or successful, depending on your perspective.
[02:11:49.787 --> 02:11:51.108]  And it makes me very angry.
[02:11:52.589 --> 02:11:54.430]  It makes me extremely angry.
[02:11:55.194 --> 02:11:56.315]  to see this going on.
[02:11:56.395 --> 02:11:57.576]  Look, it's globalism.
[02:11:57.636 --> 02:11:59.157]  It's in the CFR's own document.
[02:11:59.197 --> 02:12:00.498]  Lou Dobbs has read it on air.
[02:12:01.118 --> 02:12:06.062]  The CFR says, no borders, unlimited illegals, China, Russia, Mexico, it doesn't matter.
[02:12:06.702 --> 02:12:08.944]  I feel bad, you know, but I have to cover the facts.
[02:12:09.084 --> 02:12:21.493]  I owe it to everybody, including all, even the illegal alien listeners, because I know that this creates divides and hurts people's feelings, but this is part of this master plan, and it's got to be exposed.
[02:12:22.487 --> 02:12:25.429]  And I don't like having to cover this and get into this.
[02:12:26.729 --> 02:12:28.930]  What I feel bad about is we always talk about Mexicans.
[02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:33.112]  It's just that Mexicans are 75 to 80 percent of the illegals in this country.
[02:12:33.613 --> 02:12:36.014]  And folks, there's a million illegal aliens in Utah.
[02:12:36.054 --> 02:12:36.754]  That's state numbers.
[02:12:36.814 --> 02:12:37.114]  It's not 100,000.
[02:12:37.195 --> 02:12:39.676]  CNN and all the rest of them do that.
[02:12:40.036 --> 02:12:41.837]  It's not 12, 14, 20 million.
[02:12:41.857 --> 02:12:43.097]  It's 25 plus mil.
[02:12:44.418 --> 02:12:46.779]  And it's the end of this country.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:47.960]  Period.
[02:12:48.689 --> 02:12:49.809]  And they teach at UT.
[02:12:49.829 --> 02:12:51.050]  They teach everywhere in the country.
[02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:53.871]  The white, the black professors teach that America's bad.
[02:12:53.891 --> 02:12:55.352]  The Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[02:12:56.232 --> 02:12:56.972]  And it's happening.
[02:12:57.592 --> 02:12:59.053]  Of course, the Mexicans won't get anything.
[02:12:59.633 --> 02:13:02.334]  They'll just be slaves like they are in Mexico, along with the rest of us.
[02:13:02.814 --> 02:13:04.595]  The globalists want to break this country down.
[02:13:04.615 --> 02:13:05.235]  They're doing it.
[02:13:06.436 --> 02:13:08.356]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:13:09.977 --> 02:13:14.199]  Up next, I guess, is Joe in Virginia.
[02:13:14.259 --> 02:13:15.059]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:13:16.889 --> 02:13:18.070]  He's got his radio on too.
[02:13:18.130 --> 02:13:20.351]  See, just let him go.
[02:13:21.732 --> 02:13:22.693]  This is what's happened.
[02:13:23.033 --> 02:13:29.718]  You listen to other talk radio shows, very rarely do you go to the callers and you hear the radio on in the background.
[02:13:30.839 --> 02:13:31.439]  Very rarely.
[02:13:31.659 --> 02:13:36.582]  Here, I don't beat your head in with it, I don't get mad at you, and you just do it.
[02:13:37.583 --> 02:13:39.785]  Now I understand sometimes when people hold for 30 minutes.
[02:13:39.805 --> 02:13:40.545]  We're not doing that now.
[02:13:40.565 --> 02:13:41.666]  I'm going to your calls quickly.
[02:13:42.626 --> 02:13:44.967]  Like, three calls last hour didn't get on air because of this.
[02:13:45.087 --> 02:13:46.808]  Listen over the telephone.
[02:13:47.508 --> 02:13:49.849]  If you don't, we're just going to let you go when I hear that radio.
[02:13:50.269 --> 02:13:51.429]  Megan in California.
[02:13:51.469 --> 02:13:52.330]  Megan, you're on the air.
[02:13:52.810 --> 02:13:53.730]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:56.751]  It's Reagan in Sacramento, and I got away from the computer.
[02:13:56.831 --> 02:13:57.552]  I'm in my kitchen.
[02:13:57.592 --> 02:13:58.652]  I'm on the phone with you.
[02:13:58.732 --> 02:13:59.512]  I didn't go near it.
[02:13:59.532 --> 02:14:00.333]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:14:00.373 --> 02:14:00.733]  Go ahead.
[02:14:01.073 --> 02:14:02.173]  Okay, two things.
[02:14:02.253 --> 02:14:11.817]  What I did was just as I was reading, I've been reading up about everything you've been talking about, and I went on the net and found something that directly applies to people in California
[02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:15.126]  Working as California Estate Employees.
[02:14:15.246 --> 02:14:16.168]  It's CALPERS.
[02:14:16.849 --> 02:14:22.540]  CALPERS is the acronym for California Public Employee Retirement System.
[02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:25.005]  It's owned by the Carlisle Group.
[02:14:26.303 --> 02:14:32.768]  Well, I knew Karloff Group was buying up movie studios, movie theaters, TV... I didn't know that, and I wanted your listeners.
[02:14:32.808 --> 02:14:40.354]  The other thing I... Well, you know the majority owner, and I know Kelper's got in trouble a few years ago with some investments that got out of control.
[02:14:41.855 --> 02:14:44.577]  You know who the majority owner of the Karloff Group is, right?
[02:14:45.117 --> 02:14:49.240]  I'm not... I hear it's Rockefeller or the... I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:50.621]  No, no, this is in the Times of London.
[02:14:50.701 --> 02:14:52.323]  It's official financial filings.
[02:14:52.343 --> 02:14:52.903]  Okay.
[02:14:53.383 --> 02:14:54.024]  Queen of England.
[02:14:55.806 --> 02:14:56.306]  Bushes.
[02:14:56.927 --> 02:14:57.567]  Bin Laden's.
[02:14:58.287 --> 02:14:58.668]  Okay.
[02:14:58.708 --> 02:14:59.888]  The Queen of England's the biggest.
[02:14:59.928 --> 02:15:00.609]  Next, the Bushes.
[02:15:00.689 --> 02:15:01.429]  Next, the Bin Laden's.
[02:15:01.829 --> 02:15:02.229]  Okay.
[02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:07.612]  The other thing I heard that relates that is very similar to what happened to the Twin Towers.
[02:15:07.672 --> 02:15:09.013]  It was on the news the other night.
[02:15:09.513 --> 02:15:12.995]  The Trojan power plant in Rainier, Oregon.
[02:15:13.495 --> 02:15:15.496]  It was a model for the Simpsons cartoon.
[02:15:16.016 --> 02:15:18.958]  They blew it up with 230 pounds of explosives.
[02:15:19.358 --> 02:15:21.759]  Guess how long it took to hit the ground?
[02:15:22.299 --> 02:15:23.000]  Ten seconds.
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:25.281]  Same amount of time it took the Twin Towers.
[02:15:25.663 --> 02:15:28.264]  Does that sound familiar to anybody, like 9-11?
[02:15:29.665 --> 02:15:31.766]  Well, we know 9-11 was a controlled demolition.
[02:15:31.786 --> 02:15:35.168]  We have the firefighters, the police, the blast points, the owner saying he blew it up.
[02:15:36.349 --> 02:15:44.293]  There's a video on Google where the firefighters, it's been videotaped, the firefighters are saying they got the word to get out of there.
[02:15:44.353 --> 02:15:45.953]  They found bombs in there.
[02:15:46.154 --> 02:15:47.734]  Yeah, well there's about a hundred videos.
[02:15:47.794 --> 02:15:48.995]  I'm not exaggerating on that.
[02:15:49.015 --> 02:15:49.475]  I believe it.
[02:15:49.515 --> 02:15:50.736]  We just posted a new one this week.
[02:15:51.414 --> 02:15:53.475]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:15:53.575 --> 02:15:54.756]  I'd love to talk to you.
[02:15:55.096 --> 02:15:55.957]  Thank you, Regan.
[02:15:56.437 --> 02:15:57.978]  Regan, it's great hearing from you.
[02:15:58.899 --> 02:15:59.639]  Who's up next?
[02:15:59.679 --> 02:16:00.620]  We'll just do it this way.
[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:01.340]  Who's up next?
[02:16:02.601 --> 02:16:04.042]  Keith in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:04.542]  Go ahead.
[02:16:04.562 --> 02:16:09.005]  Hi, I had a question.
[02:16:09.365 --> 02:16:16.570]  I've been looking at your website and some of the movies that you made, and it's pretty interesting, and I've showed a couple people.
[02:16:17.650 --> 02:16:18.431]  Two questions I had.
[02:16:19.578 --> 02:16:20.939]  How did you get started in all this?
[02:16:21.479 --> 02:16:28.183]  And the other one was, since you're basically a thorn in the New World Order's side... Why am I still alive?
[02:16:29.404 --> 02:16:30.024]  Exactly!
[02:16:30.765 --> 02:16:31.725]  How long have you been listening?
[02:16:32.366 --> 02:16:44.753]  Well, I just started listening today, but I've been looking at your videos, I watched them all, and I looked at Bohemian Grove, and I looked at Washington, D.C., and how there's an owl right under the U.S.
[02:16:44.793 --> 02:16:45.133]  Senate.
[02:16:45.916 --> 02:16:48.318]  And I was just like, I can't believe this stuff is real.
[02:16:48.338 --> 02:16:51.241]  Like you said, truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:16:52.202 --> 02:16:55.225]  Well, let me answer the question of how I got started.
[02:16:55.245 --> 02:16:56.246]  I was in college.
[02:16:56.306 --> 02:16:59.089]  They were teaching us that world government was good and that guns were bad.
[02:17:00.109 --> 02:17:06.671]  And then I would turn on CNN and they would say, world government doesn't exist, insane terrorists say it does.
[02:17:06.731 --> 02:17:08.531]  And I went, but wait, I'm learning it in college.
[02:17:09.311 --> 02:17:10.511]  And I'd read a lot of history books.
[02:17:10.571 --> 02:17:12.872]  I knew governments engaged in subterfuge and lies.
[02:17:13.292 --> 02:17:16.353]  But then my professors told me governments were only good and never did bad.
[02:17:16.393 --> 02:17:17.333]  You could only trust them.
[02:17:18.313 --> 02:17:19.514]  And I thought, well, that's a lie.
[02:17:20.334 --> 02:17:26.015]  And then I got an access TV show 12 years ago, a radio show 10 years ago, a syndicated show eight and a half, nine years ago.
[02:17:26.795 --> 02:17:28.336]  And I started making films in 1997.
[02:17:30.490 --> 02:17:39.337]  Which is nine years ago and I started websites nine years ago and that's basically it.
[02:17:39.377 --> 02:17:40.038]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:40.058 --> 02:17:43.000]  I'll answer your question about why I'm still alive when we get back.
[02:17:47.065 --> 02:17:51.569]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.909 --> 02:17:55.993]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.293 --> 02:17:56.854]  We listened.
[02:17:57.154 --> 02:18:02.138]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.419 --> 02:18:02.899]  We listened.
[02:18:03.279 --> 02:18:06.322]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.742 --> 02:18:07.263]  We listened.
[02:18:07.723 --> 02:18:11.805]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.186 --> 02:18:12.666]  We listened.
[02:18:13.006 --> 02:18:18.249]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.669 --> 02:18:20.030]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:27.774]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:28.154 --> 02:18:31.296]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[02:18:41.787 --> 02:18:48.492]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.893 --> 02:18:54.377]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.957 --> 02:18:55.457]  That's right.
[02:18:55.778 --> 02:18:58.059]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:05.545]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.084 --> 02:19:13.793]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.214 --> 02:19:19.020]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.694 --> 02:19:25.119]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.499 --> 02:19:29.643]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.023 --> 02:19:30.264]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.284 --> 02:19:32.225]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.285 --> 02:19:32.586]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:32.906 --> 02:19:33.166]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.151 --> 02:19:48.672]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.152 --> 02:19:53.394]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[02:19:53.975 --> 02:19:59.617]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[02:20:00.197 --> 02:20:06.320]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?

[02:20:46.357 --> 02:20:48.438]  What has been deemed the healthiest oil on the earth?
[02:20:48.998 --> 02:20:50.138]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[02:20:50.438 --> 02:20:52.819]  What did Woman's Day Magazine call the miracle oil?
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:54.420]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:21:00.242]  Why have people reported increased energy, reduction in food craving, and an easier time losing weight?
[02:21:00.702 --> 02:21:02.003]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[02:21:02.323 --> 02:21:03.283]  The answer is clear!
[02:21:03.643 --> 02:21:06.444]  It's time to switch to Virgin Coconut Oil by Nourishing Planet.
[02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:12.606]  Made from organic coconuts, Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil is produced in the pristine Fiji Islands.
[02:21:12.626 --> 02:21:14.467]  Using coconuts within hours of opening,
[02:21:14.827 --> 02:21:21.993]  Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil retains more of the nutrition, including the tocotrienols, which are powerful vitamin E antioxidants.
[02:21:22.354 --> 02:21:27.278]  The minimally processed coconuts allow for delightful taste and the aroma of fresh coconuts.
[02:21:27.838 --> 02:21:32.362]  Order your Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil by visiting ecoviva.com.

[02:21:36.286 --> 02:21:37.727]  Or call 1-866-VIRGIN-COCONUT-OIL.
[02:21:38.097 --> 02:21:38.638]  680-8484 That's 1-866-680-8484
[02:21:48.718 --> 02:21:49.178]  Don't worry.
[02:21:49.679 --> 02:21:51.219]  This show is documented.
[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:54.461]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.901 --> 02:21:58.403]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:58.824 --> 02:22:02.926]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:22:03.466 --> 02:22:05.387]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:22:06.028 --> 02:22:15.753]  Alright, to answer the question that I get from everybody who's a new listener, I've said I should have a little hotkey here on the computer where I have a canned answer for it, but your questions are important.
[02:22:16.599 --> 02:22:17.919]  Number one, God's in control.
[02:22:18.519 --> 02:22:19.840]  Number two, I've done my work.
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:20.700]  I've put it out there.
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:22.480]  If they kill me, they'll just make me a martyr.
[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:32.462]  They're more apt to just demonize me and try to discredit me and make stuff up, which they do on a routine basis with controlled opposition and mainstream attack pieces from above and below at every level.
[02:22:33.822 --> 02:22:35.683]  And there's too many of us.
[02:22:36.243 --> 02:22:37.663]  We have to get past fear.
[02:22:37.763 --> 02:22:41.024]  So many of us that get into the truth movement live in fear, are paranoid.
[02:22:41.364 --> 02:22:43.284]  When you act like that, trouble comes on to you.
[02:22:44.033 --> 02:22:44.793]  I mean, I'm here.
[02:22:44.913 --> 02:22:45.474]  I'm committed.
[02:22:45.574 --> 02:22:46.194]  I'm doing this.
[02:22:46.354 --> 02:22:48.455]  I ask God for guidance and protection.
[02:22:48.815 --> 02:22:49.515]  I believe that.
[02:22:49.655 --> 02:22:50.296]  I have faith.
[02:22:50.956 --> 02:22:52.116]  And I've counted the cost.
[02:22:52.177 --> 02:22:56.678]  I'm willing to give my life up for freedom and to protect those that can't defend themselves.
[02:22:56.698 --> 02:22:57.899]  That's what a warrior does.
[02:22:58.319 --> 02:22:59.440]  It's what a man does.
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:00.500]  I'm not a slave.
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:03.261]  I've not turned my face away from my fathers.
[02:23:04.022 --> 02:23:06.523]  And I am doing, historically, what a man is supposed to do.
[02:23:06.863 --> 02:23:09.564]  And the elite is so evil and so wicked, we've got to fight them.
[02:23:10.146 --> 02:23:11.047]  So there's your answer.
[02:23:11.327 --> 02:23:16.171]  I'm told Stuart disagrees, so he'll go to the head of the line from New York, then Sasha, Taylor, Rick, and others.
[02:23:16.211 --> 02:23:16.972]  Go ahead, Stuart.
[02:23:17.392 --> 02:23:27.281]  Okay, Alex, I have to disagree with your assessment of the Pentagon issue that I just read on your website, where you feel that it could be a poison pill issue.
[02:23:28.502 --> 02:23:30.363]  It's kind of like unringing a bell to me.
[02:23:30.844 --> 02:23:31.404]  It's too late.
[02:23:31.524 --> 02:23:33.406]  They could manufacture a crystal clear
[02:23:36.127 --> 02:23:52.641]  Well, sir, you can't un-ring that bell for you or myself, but for the general public.
[02:23:52.942 --> 02:23:55.984]  Sir, I'm telling you what I believe the government's doing, what they're up to.
[02:23:56.024 --> 02:23:57.485]  I've been predicting they'd do this.
[02:23:57.766 --> 02:23:58.847]  What a surprise!
[02:23:58.867 --> 02:24:02.370]  Sir, the new video is meant to heighten the debate.
[02:24:02.770 --> 02:24:03.751]  It's meant to increase it.
[02:24:04.381 --> 02:24:05.281]  That's all I've been saying.
[02:24:05.361 --> 02:24:06.962]  I've been saying we should look out for this.
[02:24:07.462 --> 02:24:10.042]  Oh, I wouldn't put that past them, but thank God.
[02:24:10.142 --> 02:24:11.963]  Okay, well then we agree.
[02:24:12.503 --> 02:24:17.644]  But thank God, I don't think they're going to get away with it because of the evidence that you've turned up.
[02:24:18.064 --> 02:24:24.326]  I know, my only point about the Pentagon is I think we should look at it, but we should also not let the media only get us to focus on that.
[02:24:24.346 --> 02:24:25.266]  We should look at everything else.
[02:24:25.916 --> 02:24:27.537]  Okay, on that I would have to agree with you.
[02:24:27.697 --> 02:24:33.741]  If you look at the hundreds of points that show an inside job, let's say a third of them are wrong, and of course a third of them aren't wrong.
[02:24:34.342 --> 02:24:37.324]  Still, if 10% was right, it shows it's an inside job.
[02:24:37.924 --> 02:24:38.544]  Absolutely.
[02:24:39.625 --> 02:24:40.105]  Absolutely.
[02:24:40.165 --> 02:24:44.048]  Gosh, I sure wish I could go to California to see your events.
[02:24:44.768 --> 02:24:46.149]  Well, maybe we'll have one in New York.
[02:24:46.189 --> 02:24:47.330]  We're having a lot of requests for that.
[02:24:47.370 --> 02:24:48.371]  That would be great.
[02:24:49.632 --> 02:24:51.133]  You'd pack the place in no time.
[02:24:51.293 --> 02:24:52.293]  Thanks for the call, Stuart.
[02:24:52.974 --> 02:24:54.535]  Sasha in Missouri, go ahead.
[02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.390]  Hello?
[02:24:57.610 --> 02:24:57.810]  Yes.
[02:24:58.390 --> 02:24:59.111]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:24:59.371 --> 02:24:59.711]  Welcome.
[02:25:01.972 --> 02:25:07.674]  I can't agree enough with a lot of what you're saying here, but I wanted to go to a specific incident that's been going on in Washington.
[02:25:08.454 --> 02:25:10.855]  Ehud Olmert gave a speech today.
[02:25:11.175 --> 02:25:11.996]  I don't know if you caught that?
[02:25:12.016 --> 02:25:13.896]  The Israeli Prime Minister?
[02:25:14.296 --> 02:25:14.657]  Indeed.
[02:25:15.757 --> 02:25:17.157]  No, I didn't catch his speech.
[02:25:17.458 --> 02:25:19.898]  Every day he says they may attack Iran, the U.S.
[02:25:19.918 --> 02:25:21.979]  needs to attack Iran for Israel.
[02:25:22.019 --> 02:25:22.900]  Was it a repeat of that?
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:25.320]  It was, and it actually went a little bit further.
[02:25:25.701 --> 02:25:26.121]  It said that
[02:25:27.079 --> 02:25:36.928]  That they would be able to enforce what is, in essence, a furthering of an imperialist agenda by resetting the borders because of an instability in the Palestinian government.
[02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:45.235]  Now that Hamas and Palestine are going at it tooth and nail, we can't really expect Israel to do anything but that, can we?
[02:25:47.097 --> 02:25:48.458]  Is that what Olmert said?
[02:25:49.019 --> 02:25:53.643]  Well, he basically is using this as, I want to say, sort of an excuse
[02:25:54.471 --> 02:25:58.528]  To re-establish a border system to maybe push his walls out even further.
[02:26:00.811 --> 02:26:02.132]  Well, I mean, it's on record.
[02:26:02.212 --> 02:26:05.675]  Israel says they wanted us to go into Iraq and break it in three to four pieces.
[02:26:05.735 --> 02:26:06.316]  That's happened.
[02:26:06.956 --> 02:26:08.377]  Balkanization is the plan.
[02:26:08.778 --> 02:26:09.999]  Officially, that's what they call it.
[02:26:10.059 --> 02:26:11.220]  Balkanizing the Middle East.
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:16.124]  They want to Balkanize Persia, what's known as Iran today, into three to four parts as well.
[02:26:16.644 --> 02:26:17.065]  And U.S.
[02:26:17.105 --> 02:26:26.753]  Special Forces and Israeli Special Forces are confirmed by Seymour Hersh and others of being in Iran for a year now, picking targets and lazing targets.
[02:26:27.414 --> 02:26:29.015]  And they're going ahead with it, it looks like.
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:34.402]  It does, and I suppose we're just going to sit by and watch another war get waged in our name.
[02:26:36.643 --> 02:26:38.883]  Well, not without a government-sponsored terror attack.
[02:26:38.943 --> 02:26:40.064]  It's wildly unpopular.
[02:26:40.084 --> 02:26:47.607]  They're not getting Russia and China on board yet, but they weren't on board for the year built up to the Iraq War and finally got on board, or at least neutral.
[02:26:47.667 --> 02:26:48.307]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:49.341 --> 02:26:50.842]  We're going to go ahead and go to break here.
[02:26:50.862 --> 02:26:54.303]  We'll come back and talk to Taylor, Stewart, and others.
[02:26:54.323 --> 02:26:55.503]  I'm going to take a lot of your calls.
[02:26:55.543 --> 02:26:57.104]  I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[02:26:57.144 --> 02:26:58.224]  I'm going to take a whole bunch of them.
[02:26:58.684 --> 02:27:02.005]  I love how callers bring up different issues, different angles, different items.
[02:27:02.626 --> 02:27:07.007]  If you disagree with me, if you agree, if you have a question, a comment, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:07.027 --> 02:27:07.067]  800-259-9231.
[02:27:13.161 --> 02:27:23.027]  And yes, we do have a big 9-11 symposium with the best experts in the world there, exposing it as an inside job, coming up June 24th and 25th in Los Angeles.
[02:27:24.448 --> 02:27:25.368]  I hope to see you there.
[02:27:25.388 --> 02:27:27.410]  I'm personally inviting you.
[02:27:27.470 --> 02:27:32.313]  Learn details at InfoWars.com, get tickets online, or call our toll-free number and get them.
[02:27:32.773 --> 02:27:33.814]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.854 --> 02:27:34.434]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.335 --> 02:27:37.256]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.736 --> 02:27:39.217]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.243 --> 02:27:42.984]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.885 --> 02:27:50.327]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:27:50.587 --> 02:27:54.188]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:27:54.328 --> 02:28:02.451]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:28:02.711 --> 02:28:08.333]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:28:08.633 --> 02:28:13.876]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:28:14.136 --> 02:28:16.238]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:28:16.498 --> 02:28:28.645]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:28:28.865 --> 02:28:33.309]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:28:33.509 --> 02:28:34.470]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:34.651 --> 02:28:36.272]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:28:36.392 --> 02:28:38.194]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:28:38.454 --> 02:28:38.915]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:28:38.955 --> 02:28:39.135]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:28:46.218 --> 02:28:47.839]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.959 --> 02:28:52.082]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.202 --> 02:28:55.064]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.164 --> 02:29:01.889]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.069 --> 02:29:05.071]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.271 --> 02:29:07.673]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.793 --> 02:29:12.516]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.756 --> 02:29:13.536]  We're good to go!
[02:29:36.988 --> 02:29:37.429]  803-4438.
[02:29:37.489 --> 02:29:37.870]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.950 --> 02:29:39.352]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:29:46.403 --> 02:29:48.745]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:48.985 --> 02:29:51.027]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:51.167 --> 02:29:58.212]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:58.492 --> 02:30:07.019]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:30:58.325 --> 02:31:02.847]  We're about to go right back to your calls.
[02:31:04.767 --> 02:31:14.510]  We've got 14 different specials on Infowars.com right now on the secure online safe shopping cart.
[02:31:15.655 --> 02:31:16.695]  Fourteen different specials.
[02:31:16.735 --> 02:31:20.477]  We've got deals where you get four DVDs at basically half off.
[02:31:20.937 --> 02:31:24.498]  We've got deals where you get three DVDs and save, I don't know, like $15.
[02:31:24.558 --> 02:31:27.899]  We've got deals where you get two books and save something like 30%.
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:30.120]  We've got a whole bunch of specials.
[02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:34.622]  We've got specials where some of my films are as low as $5.95 a piece.
[02:31:35.322 --> 02:31:37.323]  All of this, we have t-shirts where they're $9.95 a piece.
[02:31:38.943 --> 02:31:39.424]  We're good to go.
[02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:01.802]  Just go check it out.
[02:32:01.842 --> 02:32:03.204]  Watch trailers of the films.
[02:32:03.264 --> 02:32:05.568]  Watch large segments of the films for free.
[02:32:06.048 --> 02:32:10.536]  You can watch Martial Law for free, the entire film, on my website.
[02:32:10.596 --> 02:32:11.197]  The whole thing!
[02:32:11.838 --> 02:32:17.601]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day membership and get the high quality downloads.
[02:32:18.061 --> 02:32:19.302]  It's a great activist tool.
[02:32:19.382 --> 02:32:31.488]  All 14 of my films, dozens of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my two weekly TV reports, video interviews in studio, my new films weeks before they even are officially released on DVD.
[02:32:32.149 --> 02:32:35.791]  Everything there for you at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:36.191 --> 02:32:36.751]  15 cents a day.
[02:32:37.151 --> 02:32:38.032]  A monthly membership is $5.95.
[02:32:40.925 --> 02:32:45.519]  A cup of coffee is $1 at the gas station, $1.50 at Starbucks, $2 at Starbucks.
[02:32:45.901 --> 02:32:48.428]  It's the cost of 3 or 4 cups of coffee at the gas station.
[02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:51.730]  Two or three cups of coffee at Starbucks.
[02:32:51.930 --> 02:32:53.051]  That's the analogy here.
[02:32:53.211 --> 02:32:54.171]  It's analogous to that.
[02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:55.511]  I mean, this is such a good deal.
[02:32:55.611 --> 02:33:00.812]  PrisonPlanet.tv and then you fund all our bandwidth and the webmasters and what we're doing here.
[02:33:00.852 --> 02:33:03.713]  Your purchases, your support makes it all possible.
[02:33:03.753 --> 02:33:08.274]  But there's nothing like getting an original DVD or VHS copy of Order of Death.
[02:33:08.294 --> 02:33:14.515]  When you order that video, you get free the updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the same DVD or VHS tape.
[02:33:14.995 --> 02:33:17.037]  And the quality is so much better than the internet.
[02:33:17.537 --> 02:33:19.459]  Get them, make copies, get them out to people.
[02:33:19.499 --> 02:33:20.380]  It is so effective.
[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:23.203]  My new film, of course, Martial Law, is excellent.
[02:33:23.563 --> 02:33:24.263]  You need these.
[02:33:24.444 --> 02:33:29.048]  Infowars.com or call toll free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:29.068 --> 02:33:31.570]  Again, that number if you missed it, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:42.410]  People gripe at me.
[02:33:42.431 --> 02:33:43.691]  I never give the mailing address out.
[02:33:43.751 --> 02:33:50.395]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:33:52.816 --> 02:33:55.598]  So PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[02:33:57.019 --> 02:34:02.662]  You can go to all those sites and buy them off the shopping cart or get memberships at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:02.902 --> 02:34:04.643]  Now let's go through your calls quickly here.
[02:34:05.763 --> 02:34:10.647]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Mass is up first.
[02:34:10.667 --> 02:34:11.528]  Rick, go ahead.
[02:34:11.768 --> 02:34:12.729]  Mr. Jones, how are you?
[02:34:12.769 --> 02:34:14.290]  And it's Richard from Massachusetts.
[02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:14.931]  How are you doing?
[02:34:14.951 --> 02:34:17.593]  Well, we haven't gotten one name right today, so that's good.
[02:34:17.973 --> 02:34:21.236]  When I go to the calls, I'm just going to say, Caller from Mass.
[02:34:21.276 --> 02:34:21.817]  From Massachusetts.
[02:34:21.837 --> 02:34:22.357]  That doesn't matter.
[02:34:22.377 --> 02:34:23.678]  You're the caller from Mass.
[02:34:23.698 --> 02:34:25.119]  We'll just give up the number.
[02:34:25.139 --> 02:34:25.700]  No, hold on.
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:26.721]  No more names.
[02:34:26.861 --> 02:34:27.802]  You're the caller from Mass.
[02:34:27.822 --> 02:34:28.162]  Go ahead.
[02:34:28.462 --> 02:34:28.922]  I don't know.
[02:34:28.962 --> 02:34:35.767]  Yeah, Prime Minister of Israel did speak today, and he did say that we must act now in order to stop Iran from acquiring.
[02:34:35.868 --> 02:34:44.034]  He said it's best to stop them while they're in the process of acquiring instead of having them get a nuclear weapon and then having them, you know, go to the process.
[02:34:44.074 --> 02:34:45.815]  But he did say that we must act now.
[02:34:46.388 --> 02:34:49.850]  And it's kind of strange to see a bunch of people rounding up in Washington, D.C.
[02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:54.413]  You got Prime Minister Tony Blair coming down tomorrow and speak to the President.
[02:34:54.693 --> 02:34:55.713]  You got Vicente Fox.
[02:34:55.753 --> 02:35:00.036]  You see a lot of these bigwigs in town for, I'm pretty sure it's going to be a special event.
[02:35:00.296 --> 02:35:10.562]  And also, the Istanbul fire that happened today in Turkey, you hear Fox News, you know, putting all their fear propaganda, talking about 9-11, terrorism, Osama Bin Laden.
[02:35:10.582 --> 02:35:12.163]  They even threw in the whole bird flu.
[02:35:12.944 --> 02:35:18.661]  The Zogby Poem as well was like this whole fear propaganda of
[02:35:19.711 --> 02:35:22.392]  Osama Bin Laden tape being released, almost 24 hours.
[02:35:22.812 --> 02:35:24.113]  I found that quite ironic.
[02:35:25.154 --> 02:35:28.815]  And the movement, when are we going to start making these mass arrests of these people?
[02:35:29.075 --> 02:35:32.597]  There's 70 million people that disagree with the official government story.
[02:35:32.637 --> 02:35:36.459]  Why not round up 5 million of these 70 million in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:36.519 --> 02:35:37.619]  and start making these arrests?
[02:35:37.759 --> 02:35:39.980]  Well, we always hear that in a primitive level.
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:42.841]  That's the old pitchforks going to the palace.
[02:35:42.901 --> 02:35:44.122]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:46.283 --> 02:35:47.083]  It would work, really.
[02:35:47.464 --> 02:35:48.264]  What do you think would happen?
[02:35:48.846 --> 02:35:56.530]  Well, I'm pretty sure that they might have the National Guard there, they might declare martial law, but it's just to show the rest of the world what's going on here in America.
[02:35:56.930 --> 02:35:58.531]  I can guarantee that it will work.
[02:35:58.611 --> 02:36:08.156]  Once we kick down the door of the Congress and start arresting these people, and start charging them with these acts of terrorism that they're conducting here on American soil, as well as overseas, I'm pretty sure we can
[02:36:09.577 --> 02:36:14.021]  I mean, it's not something that will go down without plan or without merit.
[02:36:14.061 --> 02:36:15.562]  I'm pretty sure something like this can be.
[02:36:15.663 --> 02:36:21.568]  And you think the government, while we plan this 5 million man army... I mean, I'm speaking hypothetically.
[02:36:21.588 --> 02:36:26.632]  It doesn't necessarily have to be 5 million, but I mean, like you've had previous callers that say, yeah,
[02:36:27.613 --> 02:36:32.476]  The police officers in their towns now starting to wake up to the truth and why not get these police officers?
[02:36:32.496 --> 02:36:35.737]  We have the power to make some civil arrest ourselves.
[02:36:36.078 --> 02:36:50.745]  I mean the radicals did it when I was taught in elementary school about the Constitution back in the 17-1800s how the radicals went into Congress when they disagreed with the government, boarded up Congress and started kicking everybody out and this lasted for over 48 hours and it worked.
[02:36:50.825 --> 02:36:52.426]  I mean they had their voices heard.
[02:36:52.826 --> 02:36:53.927]  Why not have our voices?
[02:36:54.912 --> 02:36:56.954]  By making this mass demonstration.
[02:36:57.394 --> 02:36:59.877]  Are you talking about a mass demonstration?
[02:37:00.497 --> 02:37:06.824]  A mass demonstration can be the preemptive way of starting it and then kicking down the doors and beginning the arrest.
[02:37:07.285 --> 02:37:08.426]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:37:09.066 --> 02:37:11.950]  Try that and see what happens to you.
[02:37:12.310 --> 02:37:14.012]  We are not the people we were 200 years ago.
[02:37:15.788 --> 02:37:19.551]  We are fat, we are soft, we are decadent, most Americans.
[02:37:19.991 --> 02:37:23.233]  I mean, they can get 5 million illegal aliens to demonstrate in major U.S.
[02:37:23.273 --> 02:37:27.636]  cities because the government's behind it, the media's behind it, Bush PR firm's behind it.
[02:37:28.197 --> 02:37:38.184]  Any type of anti-war or pro-Second Amendment or pro-rights of any type demonstration has provocateurs in it, has the media demonizing it day one.
[02:37:39.136 --> 02:37:43.420]  The farmers back in the seventies, a few hundred thousand of them, peacefully tried to go into D.C.
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:48.465]  They had police climb up in the cabs and punch fathers right in the face with billy clubs.
[02:37:49.846 --> 02:37:51.788]  Certainly, I think big demonstrations are good.
[02:37:51.808 --> 02:37:54.911]  What we need is grand juries to start indictments.
[02:37:55.411 --> 02:37:56.973]  What we need is the rule of law.
[02:37:57.493 --> 02:38:04.300]  The globalists could probably even use a phony counter-revolution to have a storm and take over and then put something even worse in.
[02:38:06.061 --> 02:38:09.122]  I mean, I've always heard this, the million man armed march to D.C.
[02:38:09.162 --> 02:38:12.323]  and Alex, why won't you shut it up and why won't you do it?
[02:38:13.063 --> 02:38:15.704]  Number one, we don't have the media power to do that.
[02:38:15.964 --> 02:38:22.046]  If we sat here for a year and tried to organize some march to D.C., we might get a hundred thousand.
[02:38:22.306 --> 02:38:22.606]  Okay?
[02:38:22.626 --> 02:38:24.347]  Because we're individualists.
[02:38:24.387 --> 02:38:26.267]  We don't have these collectivists.
[02:38:26.347 --> 02:38:26.647]  Okay?
[02:38:26.667 --> 02:38:27.608]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:38:27.648 --> 02:38:30.048]  Where are the demonstrations against the illegal aliens?
[02:38:31.229 --> 02:38:31.489]  You see?
[02:38:32.575 --> 02:38:41.762]  So, you know, always we have this Rambo-Schwarzenegger mindset of we're going to take over everything in one fell swoop.
[02:38:43.204 --> 02:38:46.406]  The New World Order didn't take over in a day, we're not going to take it back in a day.
[02:38:46.466 --> 02:38:47.187]  Why don't you try?
[02:38:47.207 --> 02:38:49.789]  You see, 60% of people focus on federal elections.
[02:38:51.087 --> 02:38:53.649]  You could go, seize Washington today, nothing would happen.
[02:38:54.049 --> 02:39:02.055]  The states, the counties are run by strong men, King Ranch, boss hog types, who will run their scams if the New World Order is taken out of the equation.
[02:39:02.335 --> 02:39:03.856]  They'll just get a bigger piece of the pie.
[02:39:04.857 --> 02:39:06.518]  Corruption is endemic.
[02:39:07.526 --> 02:39:09.627]  It is pandemic to our society.
[02:39:09.687 --> 02:39:13.990]  Why do 8% get involved in local elections and 60% in national?
[02:39:14.290 --> 02:39:16.191]  We need you to get involved locally now.
[02:39:16.731 --> 02:39:19.953]  The revolution is at the electronic voting box level.
[02:39:20.213 --> 02:39:24.915]  We have to remove those by lawsuits and education and paper ballot recalls.
[02:39:26.216 --> 02:39:31.539]  There's a hundred solutions out there, sir, and we could always have this pie in the sky.
[02:39:31.559 --> 02:39:35.201]  Alex or somebody else lead us to a military victory.
[02:39:36.261 --> 02:39:37.661]  They would love to spin that.
[02:39:37.722 --> 02:39:44.844]  They would have provocateurs in the crowd that would set off bombs, claim we did it, troops would then open fire on us with .50 caliber machine guns.
[02:39:44.884 --> 02:39:45.304]  Guaranteed!
[02:39:45.824 --> 02:39:46.244]  Guaranteed!
[02:39:47.004 --> 02:39:48.305]  And I don't think you're a Fed, sir.
[02:39:48.325 --> 02:39:49.165]  I think you mean well.
[02:39:49.765 --> 02:39:53.266]  But some of the Patriot leaders, let me tell you something.
[02:39:53.286 --> 02:40:03.090]  If somebody is allowed to get on radio and say that kind of stuff year in, year out, and say we should kill people, and say we should do this and that, they're Feds, folks.
[02:40:03.650 --> 02:40:04.550]  There's no debating it.
[02:40:05.783 --> 02:40:13.887]  If you're not a Fed and you fight the New World Order, they will have provocateurs who try to get you, say, at a restaurant at some meeting, to just agree with them.
[02:40:13.907 --> 02:40:15.487]  They'll say, you know, we ought to do something violent.
[02:40:16.088 --> 02:40:18.709]  And then you follow them out with their car, and it's an unmarked police car.
[02:40:19.409 --> 02:40:21.630]  You know, I mean, I've been through this, folks.
[02:40:22.050 --> 02:40:22.471]  Okay?
[02:40:22.511 --> 02:40:23.951]  That's why I'm still here on the air.
[02:40:24.251 --> 02:40:25.432]  I'm trying to wake people up.
[02:40:25.492 --> 02:40:26.592]  I'm trying to be serious.
[02:40:27.193 --> 02:40:28.833]  Not just, hey, we're invincible!
[02:40:28.853 --> 02:40:29.674]  We're taking over!
[02:40:29.694 --> 02:40:30.554]  Whoop-de-doo!
[02:40:30.774 --> 02:40:30.974]  Oh, boy.
[02:40:35.626 --> 02:40:36.207]  It's amazing.
[02:40:36.767 --> 02:40:39.389]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Well, I'm not going to say his name.
[02:40:39.449 --> 02:40:41.030]  Let's talk to the caller in Texas.
[02:40:41.130 --> 02:40:42.051]  Caller, you're on the air.
[02:40:42.792 --> 02:40:43.672]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:40:43.873 --> 02:40:44.133]  Good.
[02:40:45.154 --> 02:40:50.498]  Listen, I read a BBC op-ed written by Paul Reynolds of the BBC.
[02:40:50.678 --> 02:40:59.385]  He wrote a little piece about the Pentagon video, basically saying that it explains everything, and he went on to pretty much
[02:41:00.121 --> 02:41:07.523]  Yes, this new blurry video where you can see nothing is conclusive.
[02:41:07.943 --> 02:41:12.324]  Yes, where a UFO smacks the Pentagon or whatever.
[02:41:13.904 --> 02:41:27.107]  Anyway, I wrote him a little letter basically saying that I was disappointed in his flippant dismissal of all of these conspiracy ideas and his kind of kowtowing to the official story.
[02:41:27.745 --> 02:41:36.490]  And I asked him basically if he was a media lapdog at this point because in the past I've been, you know, pretty happy with the things he's written but this really kind of disappointed me.
[02:41:36.890 --> 02:41:40.372]  He just sent me back a very simple response that said, yes, I am a lapdog.
[02:41:40.412 --> 02:41:41.853]  I am a lapdog to the truth.
[02:41:41.873 --> 02:41:50.798]  I just thought it was funny that he would take the time to write that and then, you know, it's hard for me to believe that
[02:41:52.045 --> 02:41:54.827]  You know, that he understands what truth must mean.
[02:41:55.107 --> 02:41:57.910]  Well, look, a lot of people in the media aren't government agents.
[02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:59.671]  Quite a few are, and that's mainstream news.
[02:41:59.711 --> 02:42:03.674]  Now, admit it, remember ten years ago I talked about it, I was a loon, now it's mainstream news.
[02:42:04.035 --> 02:42:14.163]  But they start the ball rolling with the official story, the agents do, the paid-off people, and then these editors and producers, they pick people who are like-minded.
[02:42:14.563 --> 02:42:21.769]  They go out and find people that buy into the establishment line, and then a lot of these people really do believe the things they talk about.
[02:42:22.719 --> 02:42:39.467]  Yeah, well, you know, this guy, I had thought he was a pretty good cat, because, you know, he has, in the past, he's, you know, called a neocon when he sees them, and, you know, he's kind of pointed out some, you know, previous, I guess... Well, you know, that's another thing.
[02:42:39.507 --> 02:42:42.669]  We can't expect everybody to totally agree with everything we say.
[02:42:43.069 --> 02:42:46.831]  I mean, we have a lot of different, disparate opinions in our movement.
[02:42:47.589 --> 02:42:50.430]  And I appreciate your call, and I understand your frustration.
[02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:52.751]  Let's talk to a caller in Arizona.
[02:42:52.831 --> 02:42:53.892]  Caller, you're on the air.
[02:42:53.912 --> 02:42:56.853]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:57.253 --> 02:42:57.813]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:42:57.833 --> 02:42:58.394]  You're on the air.
[02:42:58.714 --> 02:42:59.694]  Okay, real quick.
[02:42:59.854 --> 02:43:01.435]  I just got back from a trip to New York.
[02:43:01.455 --> 02:43:03.256]  I wanted to report on three things I saw there.
[02:43:03.276 --> 02:43:06.337]  Number one, they had a news report.
[02:43:06.737 --> 02:43:11.559]  They just came on real quick and said, oh, by the way, there was a report that you can get canceled by drinking tap water.
[02:43:11.579 --> 02:43:13.480]  And they just moved on to the next story.
[02:43:14.682 --> 02:43:17.203]  Number two, there's a big sign on the highway there.
[02:43:17.223 --> 02:43:19.844]  It says, Ride the Beast.
[02:43:20.024 --> 02:43:21.665]  That's the circle line that goes around the city.
[02:43:21.725 --> 02:43:22.765]  The Taurus will go on us.
[02:43:24.386 --> 02:43:25.546]  I missed what you just said.
[02:43:26.526 --> 02:43:27.827]  Ride the Beast, it's what?
[02:43:28.227 --> 02:43:31.848]  There's a big sign on the west side highway where the circle line is.
[02:43:31.868 --> 02:43:35.130]  The circle line is a big boat that goes around Manhattan that all the Taurus go on.
[02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:35.550]  Sure.
[02:43:35.570 --> 02:43:37.190]  The sign says, Ride the Beast.
[02:43:39.091 --> 02:43:40.431]  Then it says, Circle Line, underneath.
[02:43:40.932 --> 02:43:41.592]  Wow, okay.
[02:43:42.283 --> 02:43:46.285]  Third thing is that there are now checkpoints in Midtown Manhattan.
[02:43:46.365 --> 02:43:49.647]  I, myself, got pulled over driving down on Lexington Avenue.
[02:43:49.667 --> 02:43:54.629]  They set up the wooden horses in a box and randomly pulled people over there.
[02:43:54.689 --> 02:43:56.950]  Oh yeah, they're calling it a ring of steel.
[02:43:57.371 --> 02:43:59.071]  They're calling it martial law.
[02:43:59.532 --> 02:44:00.952]  They're going to increase the police.
[02:44:00.972 --> 02:44:02.833]  They're going to randomly search everyone.
[02:44:03.253 --> 02:44:05.194]  It is literally like living in the Soviet Union.
[02:44:06.615 --> 02:44:08.016]  Well, I just wanted to report that to you, Alex.
[02:44:08.656 --> 02:44:10.537]  What was it like when you came to this checkpoint?
[02:44:11.756 --> 02:44:21.100]  Uh, it was a little bit of unbelief, a little bit, uh, uh, a little bit scary.
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:25.422]  And notice they got armed police there for you, but not armed National Guard on the border.
[02:44:25.602 --> 02:44:26.322]  Oh no!
[02:44:27.182 --> 02:44:29.603]  Not for the illegals, but for you, everything.
[02:44:29.623 --> 02:44:31.424]  They're gonna give you the full treatment.
[02:44:32.122 --> 02:44:33.342]  And every other major U.S.
[02:44:33.362 --> 02:44:35.903]  city is going to have random shakedowns on the side of the street.
[02:44:36.263 --> 02:44:37.863]  They're going to search people in malls.
[02:44:37.943 --> 02:44:39.024]  It's just hell on earth.
[02:44:39.084 --> 02:44:40.384]  Just put your hands up!
[02:44:40.524 --> 02:44:41.784]  Everybody up against the wall!
[02:44:41.864 --> 02:44:43.205]  It's freedom time!
[02:44:44.165 --> 02:44:46.286]  New York already feels like a police state now, Alex.
[02:44:46.306 --> 02:44:52.167]  They have laws now where if you drink on the subway, you drink a soda pop, you can get a ticket for that.
[02:44:52.347 --> 02:44:53.367]  What did you say to them?
[02:44:53.827 --> 02:44:54.688]  What did they do?
[02:44:54.708 --> 02:44:55.948]  You drive up, there's a checkpoint.
[02:44:55.968 --> 02:44:56.468]  What did they do?
[02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:59.729]  They said, I mean, if you drive with a license.
[02:45:01.294 --> 02:45:02.055]  Show them the driver's license.
[02:45:02.075 --> 02:45:02.756]  Papers, please.
[02:45:02.816 --> 02:45:02.916]  Okay.
[02:45:02.936 --> 02:45:04.498]  I said, where are you going?
[02:45:04.518 --> 02:45:06.821]  I said, oh, uh, we're going downtown.
[02:45:06.841 --> 02:45:08.623]  We're going to get something neat.
[02:45:08.643 --> 02:45:09.124]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:09.144 --> 02:45:11.487]  Well, then they gave me directions and they were nice and said goodbye.
[02:45:11.687 --> 02:45:13.189]  But see, that's the freedom at first.
[02:45:13.249 --> 02:45:13.990]  It's all nice.
[02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:15.571]  Hey, let me see your ID.
[02:45:15.612 --> 02:45:16.753]  Hey, where are you going?
[02:45:17.113 --> 02:45:18.295]  Hey, this is freedom.
[02:45:18.355 --> 02:45:19.076]  How do you like it?
[02:45:20.959 --> 02:45:22.800]  Can you believe this is happening in America?
[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:24.681]  I mean, that's right out of Havana, Cuba, folks.
[02:45:24.982 --> 02:45:26.583]  Driving along and there's checkpoints.
[02:45:27.043 --> 02:45:34.427]  Now, now, it was probably a normal beat cop there at the checkpoint where there's some guys a few feet away on the sidewalk with the riot helmets and machine guns.
[02:45:35.528 --> 02:45:36.809]  No, they're just regular cops.
[02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:46.615]  Because the photos I saw a month ago when they announced the Ring of Steel is not just random searches on the subways, but all over the city and it showed guys with the, you know, the black helmets and the rest of it.
[02:45:47.450 --> 02:45:52.493]  And the sad thing, Alex, is I was trying to talk to a lot of my friends about it over there, and they think it's good.
[02:45:53.974 --> 02:45:54.755]  They see nothing wrong with it.
[02:45:55.935 --> 02:45:56.496]  That's right.
[02:45:56.576 --> 02:45:57.276]  Keep you safe.
[02:45:57.316 --> 02:46:01.379]  You see, first it's checkpoints at the airport, and now checkpoints on the street.
[02:46:01.959 --> 02:46:03.860]  But the border's wide open, thanks for the call.
[02:46:04.501 --> 02:46:05.582]  Let's talk to Joe.
[02:46:05.762 --> 02:46:06.922]  Oh, I'm sorry, I said his name.
[02:46:07.143 --> 02:46:08.383]  Caller from Wisconsin.
[02:46:08.984 --> 02:46:09.724]  Go ahead, caller.
[02:46:10.124 --> 02:46:11.065]  Alex, question for you.
[02:46:11.125 --> 02:46:15.648]  Do you think that when they start this Iran war, they're going to force the draft also?
[02:46:16.192 --> 02:46:17.573]  Then they're going to tank the economy.
[02:46:17.733 --> 02:46:22.415]  Then when it's tanked, they're going to say, hmm, cash isn't good anymore because the money is worthless.
[02:46:22.435 --> 02:46:24.015]  We're going to have to give you guys chips.
[02:46:24.215 --> 02:46:25.196]  So we'll put all the money in the chip.
[02:46:25.216 --> 02:46:27.417]  Well, first it's going to be a tracker chip in the ID.
[02:46:27.457 --> 02:46:30.958]  That's the official law that is read from 200 plus feet away.
[02:46:31.618 --> 02:46:33.419]  And yes, that's exactly what they're going to do.
[02:46:33.439 --> 02:46:39.522]  They're going to stage some terror attack on the US or Europe, bring in the three draft bills they've got, 18 to 49, hell on earth.
[02:46:40.822 --> 02:46:44.685]  But build the value of the dollar so that your cash won't be worth anything.
[02:46:44.725 --> 02:46:47.648]  You could have a wheelbarrow full and they'll say, oh well that's not good anymore.
[02:46:47.688 --> 02:46:48.549]  That's already happening.
[02:46:48.569 --> 02:46:50.210]  But don't worry, there'll be plenty of checkpoints.
[02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:51.151]  Oh no, thank you.
[02:46:51.891 --> 02:46:53.493]  I'll talk to you later and thank you very much.
[02:46:53.653 --> 02:46:55.394]  You better submit to the checkpoint.
[02:46:55.414 --> 02:46:57.016]  That checkpoint's freedom.
[02:46:58.065 --> 02:46:59.446]  Uh, I don't want that much freedom.
[02:46:59.466 --> 02:46:59.986]  Thank you, Noel.
[02:47:00.947 --> 02:47:01.527]  I'll pass on that.
[02:47:01.607 --> 02:47:02.147]  Take care.
[02:47:02.627 --> 02:47:04.929]  I mean, it's just about humiliation.
[02:47:04.969 --> 02:47:07.170]  It's about letting you know you're a slave.
[02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:11.952]  And notice it's a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more.
[02:47:11.972 --> 02:47:13.693]  Hey, we don't need warrants anymore.
[02:47:13.713 --> 02:47:15.514]  Hey, we can search your house without a warrant.
[02:47:15.534 --> 02:47:18.175]  Hey, you know, we need to take your guns.
[02:47:18.235 --> 02:47:19.956]  Hey, we need to brainwash your preachers.
[02:47:21.229 --> 02:47:31.578]  We're going to go to break, come back with a final segment, take three or four more calls, jam them all in, but we did do that big report as promised right out of Ohio and 13,000 plus counties in the U.S.
[02:47:32.259 --> 02:47:38.104]  openly training the preachers to tell their flocks that gun confiscation is good, going to FEMA camps is good,
[02:47:39.004 --> 02:47:40.986]  You need to be medicated if you disagree.
[02:47:41.567 --> 02:47:43.308]  Taking people's land is good.
[02:47:43.709 --> 02:47:45.731]  Martial law is the term that was used.
[02:47:45.811 --> 02:47:46.531]  It's coming.
[02:47:46.932 --> 02:47:51.456]  It's needed to fight the American terrorists that want to overthrow America.
[02:47:52.327 --> 02:47:55.610]  That report is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:47:56.130 --> 02:47:57.651]  We have the documents along with it.
[02:47:57.671 --> 02:47:59.613]  We went to a lot of trouble to put this together for you.
[02:48:00.013 --> 02:48:00.694]  Please get it.
[02:48:00.814 --> 02:48:02.015]  Email it out to everyone.
[02:48:02.475 --> 02:48:07.419]  Bring it to your pastor this Sunday and say, Hey, are you part of that FEMA program for emergencies?
[02:48:07.439 --> 02:48:12.423]  And if they say yes, say, You need to research this and you need to get out of this or I'm leaving your church, buddy.
[02:48:12.863 --> 02:48:17.507]  And if they refuse, you hand out a hundred of those to every practitioner there.
[02:48:17.527 --> 02:48:19.208]  Is that the right term?
[02:48:19.228 --> 02:48:20.389]  To every member of the church?
[02:48:21.209 --> 02:48:27.532]  And every member of the flock, boy are they sheep to the goat's slaughter, to the Judas goat's slaughter.
[02:48:28.112 --> 02:48:29.333]  I mean, it's really happening.
[02:48:29.473 --> 02:48:37.057]  Every earmark, every signature, every tell-tale sign of ultra-tyranny, of ultra-enslavement is now upon us.
[02:48:37.117 --> 02:48:39.378]  It doesn't intimidate me, it makes me angry.
[02:48:39.738 --> 02:48:41.519]  Final segment coming up, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:46.736 --> 02:48:54.104]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.384 --> 02:48:59.129]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.350 --> 02:49:04.996]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.236 --> 02:49:09.757]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.977 --> 02:49:17.139]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.159 --> 02:49:17.939]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:17.979 --> 02:49:21.680]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:24.360]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:31.302]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:49:31.542 --> 02:49:36.811]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.831 --> 02:49:37.232]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.945 --> 02:49:51.167]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.307 --> 02:49:59.410]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.650 --> 02:50:06.712]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.892 --> 02:50:08.173]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:08.253 --> 02:50:14.157]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:19.421]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.541 --> 02:50:28.427]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:50:28.687 --> 02:50:31.990]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:46.661]  At a certain level,
[02:51:51.261 --> 02:51:56.522]  I don't enjoy chronicling all this evil, but at another level I do because I know it's good to lance the boil.
[02:51:57.383 --> 02:51:58.183]  To get it all out.
[02:51:58.203 --> 02:51:59.903]  To let you know just how serious it is.
[02:52:00.303 --> 02:52:01.264]  We're not exaggerating.
[02:52:01.284 --> 02:52:02.024]  We're not joking.
[02:52:02.044 --> 02:52:02.744]  This is serious.
[02:52:03.244 --> 02:52:04.965]  This stuff is really going on.
[02:52:06.385 --> 02:52:08.366]  All of this crazy, creeping tyranny.
[02:52:08.666 --> 02:52:10.466]  It's time to get mad and say NO!
[02:52:11.907 --> 02:52:13.347]  And start exposing these crooks.
[02:52:13.387 --> 02:52:19.088]  We have a criminal elite that thinks they own us that's trying to put enforcers in to make sure we understand that.
[02:52:19.849 --> 02:52:20.969]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[02:52:21.673 --> 02:52:23.814]  Three final calls, Gary, Eddie, and Kelly.
[02:52:24.054 --> 02:52:25.955]  Gary in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:52:26.515 --> 02:52:28.937]  Okay, good afternoon, Alex, and thanks for your efforts.
[02:52:29.077 --> 02:52:29.857]  Thank you, go ahead.
[02:52:30.337 --> 02:52:37.401]  I'm like you, I'm kind of a student of past history and compare it to current events, and they're so similar, it's just outstanding.
[02:52:37.721 --> 02:52:45.525]  I read across something when I was surfing about four weeks ago, and it's kind of stuck in my mind, it's something known as the Phoenix Project.
[02:52:46.625 --> 02:52:47.806]  Yeah, that was in Vietnam.
[02:52:48.066 --> 02:52:48.486]  Yeah.
[02:52:48.546 --> 02:52:50.127]  Torturing, killing, all of it, yeah.
[02:52:50.583 --> 02:52:51.103]  That's right.
[02:52:51.123 --> 02:52:57.206]  They decided not to play fair no more, you know, and just built the little camps out in the jungle, and you would just disappear.
[02:52:57.967 --> 02:53:02.249]  And I think, to me, the Patriot Act is nothing but the Phoenix Project on a large scale.
[02:53:03.870 --> 02:53:07.171]  Sir, the people that ran the Phoenix Projects are now the head of all U.S.
[02:53:07.231 --> 02:53:07.772]  intelligence.
[02:53:07.792 --> 02:53:08.932]  They're now running the country.
[02:53:09.312 --> 02:53:10.933]  Yeah, okay, I figured you knew about it.
[02:53:10.993 --> 02:53:13.034]  They took every sicko and... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:53:13.634 --> 02:53:14.715]  Okay, well thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:53:15.310 --> 02:53:16.031]  Thank you, Gary.
[02:53:16.371 --> 02:53:16.691]  No, no, no.
[02:53:16.791 --> 02:53:20.014]  I mean, I know about a lot of stuff I don't know a lot, so never think I know it all.
[02:53:20.695 --> 02:53:21.916]  I know how much I don't know.
[02:53:22.656 --> 02:53:24.738]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eddie in Georgia.
[02:53:24.798 --> 02:53:25.439]  Eddie, go ahead.
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:26.600]  Alex?
[02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:27.321]  Yes?
[02:53:27.861 --> 02:53:33.206]  Real quick, like, I'm a member of your PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:53:33.926 --> 02:53:35.328]  PrisonPlanet.TV, yes, sir.
[02:53:35.588 --> 02:53:36.449]  No, not TV.
[02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:40.332]  I went to PrisonPlanet.com, and when I tried to get on
[02:53:40.882 --> 02:53:42.245]  Prison Planet TV.
[02:53:42.346 --> 02:53:43.929]  I thought I bought the subscriber thing.
[02:53:44.270 --> 02:53:46.436]  It wouldn't accept my username or password.
[02:53:47.302 --> 02:53:49.443]  Okay, I can't really do the customer service.
[02:53:49.503 --> 02:53:50.763]  A few people have trouble.
[02:53:50.843 --> 02:53:53.764]  Some folks aren't very computer savvy, and we try to help you.
[02:53:53.784 --> 02:53:55.965]  You can call my office, sir, and get assistance.
[02:53:55.985 --> 02:53:56.766]  Let me give you that number.
[02:53:56.786 --> 02:53:57.726]  Okay, thank you.
[02:53:58.026 --> 02:53:58.306]  Sure.
[02:53:58.626 --> 02:54:01.367]  In fact, we're going to put you on hold, and we're going to give you that number off air.
[02:54:01.607 --> 02:54:07.349]  I really can't do technical advice live on the air because, number one, I'm not very technical.
[02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:09.010]  Let's go ahead.
[02:54:09.250 --> 02:54:11.331]  That's what happens when you don't screen calls, which is fine.
[02:54:11.371 --> 02:54:13.672]  We get, every once in a while, a technical call.
[02:54:14.772 --> 02:54:16.754]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kelly in Texas.
[02:54:16.794 --> 02:54:17.494]  Kelly, go ahead.
[02:54:17.935 --> 02:54:20.036]  Alex, a quick comment and then a quick question.
[02:54:20.357 --> 02:54:27.302]  In regards to the NSA and the wiretapping of phones, the precedent that they may cite is Smith v. Maryland.
[02:54:27.322 --> 02:54:27.942]  It's a 1979 case.
[02:54:27.982 --> 02:54:32.746]  The Supreme Court decided in favor of Maryland that it was not unconstitutional to
[02:54:33.308 --> 02:54:34.749]  To monitor his phone conversations.
[02:54:34.769 --> 02:54:35.489]  That's all I'll say on that.
[02:54:35.509 --> 02:54:36.870]  You can look that up in detail later.
[02:54:37.430 --> 02:54:38.651]  Congress says it's illegal.
[02:54:38.671 --> 02:54:40.152]  The federal law says it's illegal.
[02:54:40.172 --> 02:54:40.692]  I agree with you.
[02:54:40.732 --> 02:54:44.795]  I'm just saying the precedent in the Supreme Court level, that is the precedent as far as what they may claim.
[02:54:45.715 --> 02:54:51.058]  The question I have goes back to the Watergate days, and is there possibly of a smoking gun on the tapes?
[02:54:51.459 --> 02:55:00.824]  When Haldeman released his book, and there were many references to him cryptically referring to the Bay of Pigs, meaning the Kennedy assassination,
[02:55:02.286 --> 02:55:24.988]  In one of their meetings, they decided to kick around the idea of letting the public realize that Johnson also had bugged the Republicans, and in that meeting, Haldeman said, we already ran that up a flagpole, and Johnson's guys, and this was on Nightline, Johnson's guys said this, if you guys play around with this, then I'll release, and then the next three lines were redacted for national security, and I'm wondering if there's any way to get a freedom of information
[02:55:25.715 --> 02:55:28.498]  Are those Watergate tapes as deep-sixed already?
[02:55:28.558 --> 02:55:29.059]  Thank you.
[02:55:29.079 --> 02:55:29.940]  Yeah, they're deep-sixed.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:31.282]  They've all been edited.
[02:55:32.243 --> 02:55:35.466]  Look, I've had LBJ's personal lawyer on.
[02:55:36.808 --> 02:55:39.611]  The father of the former White House Press Secretary, Bob McClellan.
[02:55:39.631 --> 02:55:43.596]  I mean, LBJ told him he had Kennedy killed.
[02:55:44.497 --> 02:55:45.378]  I mean, there's no debating it.
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:49.901]  I've interviewed LBJ's widow, or not his widow, his mistress.
[02:55:49.982 --> 02:55:51.002]  She died a few years ago.
[02:55:51.562 --> 02:55:52.423]  Madeline Duncan Brown.
[02:55:52.763 --> 02:55:53.503]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:53.603 --> 02:55:55.364]  Ladies and gentlemen, great broadcast today.
[02:55:55.404 --> 02:55:56.604]  Thank you so much for joining us.
