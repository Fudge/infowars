[00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:07.718]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio that will be revealed to you like no other.
[00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:09.678]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.159]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.180]  Defending our borders.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.561]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:17.241]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.042]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.383]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:24.364]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:27.734]  Call Alex now toll free 877-590-5525.
[00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:29.875]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:30.915]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:47.595]  Welcome listeners out there across the country on this 26th day of November 2006.
[00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.176]  It is Sunday.
[00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:54.680]  I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving weekend listening here in Texas and around the country.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.663]  This is of course a syndicated broadcast from the studios of MS Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.405]  A lot of affiliates have signed on.
[00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.527]  The show is about a month and a half old and a lot of other stations piling on
[00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:07.268]  To carry the broadcast Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:09.709]  or to rebroadcast it later in the evening.
[00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.410]  We'll have open phones for the full two hours as we customarily do.
[00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.291]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525, 877-590-KLBJ and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:33.112]  I'd already been planning in the last few months to do a show or part of a broadcast on the police state in America and worldwide.
[00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:37.280]  Of course, that's always a staple here, one of the big issues we cover.
[00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:46.157]  But driving down after Thanksgiving, I had Thanksgiving with my family and then drove down that afternoon to Port Aransas, Texas.
[00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:53.365]  I had the enjoyment of being on I-37 and being pulled over by the state police.
[00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.268]  So I will be telling that story later in the broadcast.
[00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.730]  I know there are state police out there listening.
[00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.290]  I do speak occasionally.
[00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.430]  A few of them have pulled me over.
[00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.973]  Frankly, I've even in my first film, Made in 97, America Destroyed by Design, talked about how professional the Texas State Police are.
[00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:11.453]  I'm friends with a lot of state police.
[00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:13.734]  A lot of people high level in the state police.
[00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:16.374]  Of course, this being Austin, I'm involved in politics.
[00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:23.316]  I'm good friends with the Capitol Police from dozens and dozens of rallies and demonstrations over the years and they're big fans of the show.
[00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:25.517]  I like the Texas State Police.
[00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.982]  But I did not like the young lady that pulled me over.
[00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.243]  And, I mean, she was crazed.
[00:02:33.063 --> 00:02:33.364]  Crazed.
[00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:36.525]  She was driving so recklessly that my wife said, are they coming after us?
[00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:37.285]  And I said, no.
[00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:41.767]  There's been a fatal accident, or somebody drove off with gas, or there's been a robbery.
[00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:43.267]  They're not coming after us.
[00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:45.648]  Well, they were coming after us.
[00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.463]  And I do speed sometimes, but not with my children in the car, not with my wife.
[00:02:49.484 --> 00:02:51.965]  And when I do speed, it's usually 6-7 miles over the speed limit.
[00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:54.928]  That's probably why I usually get a warning, because I'm not going 10 miles over.
[00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:56.509]  I'm told that's customary.
[00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.450]  Most of the time you get a warning.
[00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.213]  Well, number one, I got a ticket that was incorrect.
[00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:05.035]  That's because I had cruise control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:07.537]  My wife sits there and makes sure it's exact.
[00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.623]  Okay, I drive in the slow lane with all the cars passing me.
[00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:13.045]  Everybody else going 15 miles over the speed limit.
[00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:15.207]  Banditos driving 90 miles an hour.
[00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:19.551]  In fact, literally, after we got pulled over, here come five banditos going about 90 miles an hour.
[00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.593]  I'm sure the state police won't pull them over.
[00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:24.275]  It's easier to pick on a family with an SUV.
[00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:26.437]  And what they did to my children is outrageous.
[00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:33.784]  And I don't have time to make it a personal vendetta and sue people and go after people.
[00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:35.698]  I've done that in the past.
[00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:38.260]  I've won every time, but it's a big hassle.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.401]  I'm not a litigious person, by the way.
[00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.583]  That's to be on record.
[00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:51.189]  There's people here in town right now behind bars from my latest foray, my latest, I guess you could call it,
[00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:54.466]  Invasion against tyranny.
[00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:57.971]  People sitting behind bars right here in Austin, Texas right now because of it.
[00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:01.736]  But I am going to talk about it and that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:04.820]  In fact, I'll start the story before the second hour begins.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.764]  I'm going to lead up to it with all the news from around the world.
[00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:10.647]  And a bunch of other police state news and information.
[00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:16.293]  And by the way, a police state has nothing to do with individual police officers.
[00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.015]  And most Americans are dumbed down now.
[00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:22.440]  Most Americans, police included, don't know what a police state even means.
[00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.583]  A police state is Nazi Germany.
[00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:26.505]  A police state is China today.
[00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:28.207]  A police state is Cuba today.
[00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.707]  A police state is Vietnam today.
[00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:33.868]  A police state is much of America today.
[00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.528]  It's when you don't have due process.
[00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:37.389]  It's when the government is God.
[00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.169]  It's when the people can be secretly arrested, have their property seized.
[00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.650]  It's when due process is erased.
[00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.931]  So we'll be discussing a police state today here on the transmission.
[00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:54.052]  Some of the other news we'll be going over.
[00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.954]  Iraq War has now lasted longer than World War II.
[00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:02.096]  This out of the Associated Press.
[00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:03.078]  We'll be going over that.
[00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:07.262]  There are more riots and more Mexican cities burning right now.
[00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:08.984]  There was election fraud down there.
[00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.386]  Frankly, I gotta hand it to the Mexican people.
[00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:13.808]  They don't like being slaves as much as Americans do.
[00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:17.211]  But see, they've never really had freedom, so they're not as naive.
[00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:21.975]  We're very naive because you don't know what you've lost until it's gone.
[00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.298]  Imagine when Americans find out what peons they are.
[00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:35.779]  Imagine what happens when Americans find out just how enslaved, when they take your pension funds, when they belly up the stock market, when they do all the things they have been setting up.
[00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:40.781]  But see, putting the police state in place first so you can't struggle when they do it.
[00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.822]  So we'll be going over that report.
[00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:45.403]  Also, it sounds like a headline I would write.
[00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:49.125]  In fact, when I first saw the headline on PrisonPlanet.com, I thought it was one of my writers.
[00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:51.837]  It sounds like one of our headlines.
[00:05:51.857 --> 00:05:57.480]  In fact, I think I've written headlines similar to this, but I clicked on it and it was the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:06.024]  You know, we have links, and we'll have the title, and I have no idea what paper or publication it's going to be, so I clicked on it, and it wasn't a subpage of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:06.404 --> 00:06:11.387]  It was the Chicago Sun-Times headline, Charles Rangel Thinks He Owns You.
[00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:15.038]  I've interviewed the Congressman three times in the last year.
[00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:22.022]  I think I'll get him back on either this week or next week, this week on my syndicated show, weekdays, or maybe even next Sunday for you.
[00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:28.246]  We'll see if we can wrangle that, pun intended, with Mr. Wrangle.
[00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:29.767]  It just came to me.
[00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:30.967]  I had to do it.
[00:06:31.748 --> 00:06:36.170]  So we'll get the police state maven on for you, my friends.
[00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:38.472]  Representative Tancredo.
[00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.266]  Says that Bush wants to merge U.S.
[00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:42.266]  with Mexico and Canada.
[00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:45.687]  Excuse me, Congressman, it's already been done.
[00:06:45.987 --> 00:06:47.968]  They're just now announcing it to you.
[00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:50.509]  We'll continue with that report as well.
[00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:54.270]  And he goes on to say that Bush doesn't think America should be an actual place.
[00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.530]  That's an actual quote.
[00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:03.753]  And Steve Watson, one of my UK writers in the UK Bureau that we have in London, England,
[00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:11.980]  Last Tuesday I saw Casino Royale and it had all these 9-11 illusions in it and it indeed did.
[00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:21.929]  Wednesday night I was going to stay up late to go on Coast to Coast AM with George Norris and I saw a 10 o'clock showing of it and certainly it does have a lot of connections to 9-11.
[00:07:22.714 --> 00:07:24.915]  The big one I'll go ahead and give away now, but more later.
[00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:32.817]  Oh my gosh, the CIA almost stopped 9-11 because of the insider trading, but it was too late and they weren't able to.
[00:07:33.637 --> 00:07:37.058]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was in the major British and German and even in a few U.S.
[00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:38.238]  papers, then it got shut down.
[00:07:38.698 --> 00:07:42.299]  It was the CIA doing the insider trading!
[00:07:43.142 --> 00:07:45.725]  And FBI agents went to jail over it!
[00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:47.306]  Because they were involved, too!
[00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:51.249]  I mean, people said they couldn't hide something that big if the government was involved.
[00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.250]  They didn't hide it!
[00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:53.111]  We do know!
[00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:56.714]  84% of the American people in scientific polls believe there's a cover-up.
[00:07:57.034 --> 00:08:01.438]  A majority of that majority believe it's a total inside job, and you're not going to stop the truth from getting out.
[00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:06.623]  Oh, by the way, last week, Planet Man-Cow debuted on Fox, and their producers called us
[00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:16.048]  Wednesday, before we all left town, and said, hey, this thing got such good ratings, we're going to, unprecedented, Fox doesn't do this, re-air it next Sunday!
[00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:23.912]  So that little hit, I couldn't go to Fox Studios, I sent my radio producer, Kevin Smith, he did an out of the ballpark job.
[00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:27.788]  And I guess they like getting beat so bad that they're going to re-air it.
[00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:32.251]  It was a big 10 minute plus segment and William Shatner is on the show too.
[00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:35.814]  That's coming up tonight at 8 o'clock Central, 9 o'clock Eastern on Fox.
[00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.116]  They're on the Fox Propaganda Channel.
[00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:39.898]  That'll be there for you.
[00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:41.839]  Oh, by the way, I'm excited.
[00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:48.745]  I don't know when TalkFest is going to be this year yet, but George Norrie gave me a call and told me that I'm going to be in studio with him again here.
[00:08:49.787 --> 00:08:52.929]  The only problem is I schedule a vacation in the middle of January.
[00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:53.869]  I never used to take vacation.
[00:08:53.889 --> 00:08:54.430]  I do it now.
[00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.971]  Family is the most important thing.
[00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:58.652]  So I need to find out when TalkFest is.
[00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:01.214]  In fact, if Mark calls back in to talk to you about something, please ask him.
[00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:02.534]  Because I've been wanting to know that.
[00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:03.275]  Great.
[00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:05.096]  Mark's the head honcho.
[00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:06.897]  Kind of the Darth Vader around here.
[00:09:07.057 --> 00:09:07.697]  I'm joking.
[00:09:08.118 --> 00:09:08.638]  I'm joking.
[00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:09.859]  I'm having fun.
[00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:11.319]  I know he's listening.
[00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:11.960]  That's why I said it.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.841]  If he's Darth Vader, I'm the Emperor.
[00:09:13.941 --> 00:09:14.321]  Okay?
[00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:15.622]  What does that make you?
[00:09:15.682 --> 00:09:17.323]  Viceroy Gunray, Frey?
[00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:20.109]  That's right.
[00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:27.233]  Oh man, I tell you, taking off three days of radio like I did this week, it's just unreal to take off three days.
[00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:33.216]  I just am so rejuvenated, refreshed, effervescent.
[00:09:34.497 --> 00:09:35.497]  I am feeling good.
[00:09:35.557 --> 00:09:36.017]  And you know what?
[00:09:36.037 --> 00:09:37.138]  I'm going to blow my top today.
[00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:39.039]  Yeah, it's coming up.
[00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.120]  Okay, that's some of the news that we'll be going over.
[00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:44.922]  The big police state extravaganza, what happened to me.
[00:09:45.842 --> 00:09:47.084]  But not just what happened to Alex Jones.
[00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:48.265]  What's going on in this country?
[00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:51.369]  You want me to run through it for you in machine gun fashion?
[00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:53.912]  I'll do it all on the other side of this quick break.
[00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:58.358]  Stay with us on this worldwide transmission on Sunday evening.

[00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:05.008]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:12.102]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.302 --> 00:11:15.024]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:15.084 --> 00:11:16.204]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:22.148]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:23.068 --> 00:11:30.333]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:34.375]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:39.990]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.231]  Call for your copy today.
[00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:44.692]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:45.753 --> 00:11:51.595]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:52.716]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.756 --> 00:11:52.956]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.661]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.182]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[00:12:06.502 --> 00:12:08.203]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.

[00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:25.750]  We've learned verbiage from the Total Transformation program, and it's almost like magic.
[00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.531]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:33.893]  Defiance, back talking, lying, acting on in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.

[00:12:48.658 --> 00:12:54.080]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:07.367]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:24.526]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:27.829]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:30.571]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:31.832]  NSA spies.
[00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.331]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:40.132]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.533]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:13:42.873 --> 00:13:46.774]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:14:16.872 --> 00:14:18.812]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[00:14:23.934 --> 00:14:31.996]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:14:35.037 --> 00:14:43.220]  Back when I was introducing some of the stories and topics I wanted to go over on this live Sunday broadcast, I knew I was forgetting something.
[00:14:44.215 --> 00:15:13.287]  The big jewel in the crown today is the story that broke over the week, and that was the fact that Mothers Against Drunk Driving is lobbying the car manufacturers, the federal government, the state governments, to make it mandatory that breathalyzers be built in, not to drunk drivers' cars, not to first offenders' cars, but into everyone's cars, and that we be guilty until proven innocent.
[00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:19.670]  And I heard one caller to talk radio this week say, that's like making all men register as sex offenders.
[00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:28.074]  Just, okay, it's a baby, it's a baby boy, he's an hour old, let's register him as a sex offender.
[00:15:28.754 --> 00:15:30.415]  And then a lot of police state toadies
[00:15:30.854 --> 00:15:35.916]  We'll argue that, well, you know, it's a privilege to drive.
[00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:50.201]  And by the way, I was talking to a concealed carry permit holder this weekend down at the coast, and he was telling me that he's very proud of the fact that it's a privilege to have his gun, and it's a privilege to have his concealed carry.
[00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:56.825]  No, they've turned your right into a privilege and gotten you to contractually waive your rights.
[00:15:56.865 --> 00:16:02.988]  We need Vermont concealed carry style laws that basically make violent crime non-existent.
[00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:15.656]  What you have with the police in this country and those that control them, the social architects, is a military force that has its own domestic propaganda arms and its own lobbyists.
[00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:24.782]  Who have basically indemnified themselves against liability and are God-men and women walking the face of the earth.
[00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:29.786]  It's just right back to England where the Lords can do whatever they wanted and the people are slaves.
[00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:33.369]  Let me tell you how the totem pole works in America.
[00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:42.636]  You've got the big bankers at the top, then you've got the politicians, then you've got the police, then you've got the illegal aliens, and then you've got the American people below that.
[00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:45.421]  And I rest my case with this piece of evidence.
[00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:57.814]  Two weeks ago the Associated Press reported that over 500 major lenders in the United States don't ask for social security numbers or even IDs of illegal aliens and they just give it to them.
[00:16:58.154 --> 00:17:00.317]  They just give them the housing loans.
[00:17:00.357 --> 00:17:01.658]  Just give them the apartments.
[00:17:01.963 --> 00:17:03.463]  Just give them the bank accounts!
[00:17:03.763 --> 00:17:08.464]  Of course, I already knew this a few years ago because I've been in banks and watched it.
[00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:15.726]  Citizens, black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter, are all sitting there in line for an hour, and I just kept watching illegal aliens walk in.
[00:17:15.766 --> 00:17:17.806]  You know, hard-working folks, not saying they're bad people.
[00:17:17.986 --> 00:17:23.167]  They're little cowboy hats, and they go over, and there's a Spanish-speaking person, and boom, I keep watching.
[00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:24.448]  I'm a very observant person.
[00:17:24.628 --> 00:17:25.408]  Where's the ID?
[00:17:25.468 --> 00:17:26.568]  Where's the information?
[00:17:27.028 --> 00:17:27.748]  No!
[00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:28.568]  No!
[00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:29.429]  Well, you know what?
[00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:31.689]  People couldn't believe me when I said I had observed that.
[00:17:32.398 --> 00:17:34.719]  Then, good family friends of ours.
[00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:36.240]  I've known this lady since I was three years of age.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.301]  Friends of my parents.
[00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:40.142]  She manages the biggest apartment complex in Austin.
[00:17:40.402 --> 00:17:44.044]  She managed multiple complexes, but she's cut back over the years.
[00:17:45.129 --> 00:18:11.359]  And she, about three years ago, was at a big, it was three or four, I forget, let me see, it was four Christmases ago, they were at the big Dallas meeting in mid-December, where this national company's based, and they said, the federal government is paying us incentives to help house these wonderful immigrants, and they say it's good for the economy, but it's a secret program, so don't tell anyone that, let as many as they want stay in the apartment, but if any other citizen does, go ahead and kick them out or fine them.
[00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:15.575]  Okay, this is what's going on in America.
[00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:17.899]  This is what's happening.
[00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:25.350]  I'm sure you've heard the reports where illegal aliens and immigrants get more tuition than out-of-state U.S.
[00:18:25.391 --> 00:18:27.474]  citizens at state colleges around this country.
[00:18:28.661 --> 00:18:42.599]  It's designed to suck in the foreigners, to drive down the wages, to balkanize the nation, and to get ignorant third world populations in here to pull the lever, to push the buttons in the voting booths, to abolish the Bill of Rights and Constitution!
[00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:47.585]  But how did I already digress off into this, off into this labyrinthine maze?
[00:18:48.959 --> 00:19:12.512]  The police will tell you you've got to follow the letter of every law, cross every T, dot every I, lick boots properly, prostrate yourself before government, be a good slave, but the illegal aliens, the corrupt police, the corrupt politicians, they can basically get away with bloody murder in front of everyone because the establishment wants it that way.
[00:19:12.793 --> 00:19:13.173]  And I'm
[00:19:13.693 --> 00:19:14.914]  Frankly, sick and tired of it.
[00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:16.855]  In fact, I feel the rant coming on right now.
[00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.998]  And I want to go to Mike and Lucas and Richard and many others.
[00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:22.380]  The toll-free number to join us all over the country.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.982]  We get calls from Canada, Spain, Australia, you name it.
[00:19:26.002 --> 00:19:26.462]  877-590-KLBJ.
[00:19:26.482 --> 00:19:26.643]  877-590-5525.
[00:19:26.703 --> 00:19:27.924]  Or here locally in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:19:27.944 --> 00:19:29.685]  If you're listening to the Mothership Station, 590 AM.
[00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:44.797]  You are welcome to call in again at 512-836-0590.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:54.491]  But again, I shrink almost from getting into the police state issue because I want to spend time on it.
[00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:56.767]  I want to take my time on it.
[00:19:57.187 --> 00:20:00.390]  I want to kind of do what Rush Limbaugh does sometimes when he talks for an hour and doesn't take a call.
[00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.411]  Well, I'll do that on my weekday show sometimes.
[00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:03.492]  Two hours, folks.
[00:20:03.512 --> 00:20:09.936]  I may do it once a month, but I mean, I could easily talk for two hours and never cover all the evidence.
[00:20:09.956 --> 00:20:13.479]  So what I'm going to do is just hit some of the... No, I don't want to put my case on yet.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.361]  It's coming up towards the end of this hour, end of the next.
[00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:17.782]  I'll do it.
[00:20:17.802 --> 00:20:20.503]  I mean, look at this news right here.
[00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:21.404]  Rangel.
[00:20:21.524 --> 00:20:24.206]  Charles Rangel thinks he owns you.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.804]  Congressman backs a public service draft.
[00:20:29.844 --> 00:20:39.512]  Now, I remember when Bill Clinton was in office and they set up AmeriCorps, and then Bush gets in, the same program's expanded, a subdivision, Secure Corps, was in mainstream newspapers five years ago.
[00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:44.817]  It said they're going to train the high school students to carry machine guns and aid the police.
[00:20:45.137 --> 00:20:47.238]  In warrantless searches of whole neighborhoods?
[00:20:47.418 --> 00:20:49.019]  I mean, talk about Hitler youth, folks!
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.062]  When the black, scheme-ass cops start recruiting the youth and they're stomping around?
[00:20:53.342 --> 00:20:54.683]  Brother, you're in East Germany!
[00:20:54.943 --> 00:20:56.524]  Brother, you're in Nazi Germany!
[00:20:56.784 --> 00:20:59.005]  I mean, this is tech's book!
[00:20:59.406 --> 00:21:02.427]  I mean, this is the purebred, real McCoy!
[00:21:02.447 --> 00:21:05.029]  This is gonna win the Westminster Dog Show!
[00:21:05.109 --> 00:21:08.071]  If the police state was a dog show, baby, you're getting best in show!
[00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:10.652]  You're talking you-the-new-but-champion here!
[00:21:10.992 --> 00:21:11.353]  Okay?
[00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:13.674]  I mean, baby, that is the purebred!
[00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:16.936]  That is the perfect to poise everything.
[00:21:17.397 --> 00:21:19.558]  And I'm telling you, the government's just going right down the line.
[00:21:19.698 --> 00:21:21.019]  Everything that's a police state.
[00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:22.400]  Abolishing the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:22.861]  They did it.
[00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:24.001]  Two months ago.
[00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:24.802]  Middle of October.
[00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:25.623]  October 16th.
[00:21:26.383 --> 00:21:27.244]  Abolishing the borders.
[00:21:27.304 --> 00:21:28.765]  Abolishing the country itself.
[00:21:28.845 --> 00:21:29.365]  It's gone!
[00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:32.487]  Lou Dobbs, Congressman Tom Ted Crio, Ron Paul tell you.
[00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:34.029]  I mean, we're in the North American Union.
[00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:35.290]  Does the average American know?
[00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.930]  They don't know.
[00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.572]  They're sucking their thumb driving down the road right now.
[00:21:39.355 --> 00:21:41.857]  And I'm just that nut man who's freaked out about it!
[00:21:42.137 --> 00:21:44.558]  Oh sure, let's all have breathalyzers on our cars!
[00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:46.460]  Alright, again, I'm mixing it here.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.401]  I'm mixing apples and oranges.
[00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:49.802]  It just makes me sick.
[00:21:51.203 --> 00:21:54.305]  I am, I'm like a... Let's just keep the dog analogy going.
[00:21:54.425 --> 00:21:55.906]  I'm like a dog in a butcher shop.
[00:21:55.966 --> 00:21:57.947]  I mean, there's, and I've got stuff to cover.
[00:21:58.007 --> 00:21:59.748]  It's just, it's just, there's just everything.
[00:21:59.828 --> 00:22:01.689]  All these different cutlets hanging up everywhere.
[00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.911]  There's an endless hallway of meats here.
[00:22:06.028 --> 00:22:06.949]  Yeah, entrails.
[00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:11.551]  I mean, I just... I can't... I don't know where to start here!
[00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:12.372]  It's so bad!
[00:22:12.732 --> 00:22:18.536]  It's like I'm on the deck of a ship that's exploding and sinking, and I'm the radio operator, and the shore is asking me, what's wrong with the ship?
[00:22:18.576 --> 00:22:19.656]  And I go, what is it?
[00:22:19.977 --> 00:22:21.998]  I mean, it's on fire going down!
[00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:27.061]  There's people dancing around in black ski masks, having a good time, telling us what a great job they've done.
[00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:30.163]  Government shipping in narcotics faster than ever.
[00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:33.885]  Alright, Charles Rangel thinks he owns you.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.022]  And this bill is for men and women.
[00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:38.983]  The government's setting it up.
[00:22:39.163 --> 00:22:40.544]  They've got Rangel floating it.
[00:22:41.204 --> 00:22:43.525]  But covertly, they've set up the draft boards, everything.
[00:22:43.786 --> 00:22:45.787]  And this new draft... Oh, man.
[00:22:46.327 --> 00:22:46.787]  Oh, man.
[00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:47.868]  It's bad.
[00:22:48.368 --> 00:22:55.933]  I'll briefly get into the new national draft, which they're going to spring just as soon as the Fed boys blow up something here in this country and tell you some guy with a turbine did it.
[00:22:56.213 --> 00:22:57.034]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:57.054 --> 00:22:57.494]  Stay with me.

[00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:04.935]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:08.557]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:12.119]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:24:12.446 --> 00:24:15.707]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:24:15.727 --> 00:24:21.188]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:30.850]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.311]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:37.752]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:42.692]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:24:42.712 --> 00:24:44.134]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:29.893]  I think so.
[00:25:54.929 --> 00:25:55.649]  We're good to go.
[00:26:12.369 --> 00:26:18.454]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:27:12.552 --> 00:27:14.112]  Agree or disagree?
[00:27:15.193 --> 00:27:19.314]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[00:27:19.394 --> 00:27:24.415]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:27:26.416 --> 00:27:27.096]  Welcome back!
[00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:30.677]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on the 26th day of November 2006.
[00:27:32.682 --> 00:27:42.348]  Ben and Georgetown, Patrick and Las Vegas, Richard and Phoenix, Lucas and Corpus Christi, Mike and Marilyn, we're going to get to everybody here in just a moment or two.
[00:27:44.049 --> 00:27:56.177]  But when I talk about being like a dog in a butcher shop, turning this way and that, literally, it's like my Boston Terrier, when I've got a little piece of meat in my hand and my wife does, he just gets all excited and starts looking from side to side.
[00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:58.899]  I don't know what to cover today, there's so much.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.581]  They are moving forward with a draft.
[00:28:03.144 --> 00:28:04.465]  Rangel is their front man.
[00:28:04.965 --> 00:28:06.706]  They've got different bills introduced.
[00:28:06.786 --> 00:28:07.887]  They're setting it up.
[00:28:08.247 --> 00:28:09.568]  They need a national draft.
[00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:10.929]  But they're not going to call it a draft.
[00:28:11.209 --> 00:28:13.291]  They're going to call it national conscription.
[00:28:13.311 --> 00:28:15.232]  They're going to call it national service.
[00:28:15.272 --> 00:28:16.173]  So I want to get into that.
[00:28:17.153 --> 00:28:22.477]  Also, this country has spent more time in Iraq now than we've spent in World War II.
[00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:31.263]  And we'll continue by getting into Mothers Against Drunk Driving, who wants everyone to be guilty until proven innocent.
[00:28:31.872 --> 00:28:33.273]  Everyone to be treated like a criminal.
[00:28:33.293 --> 00:28:41.438]  And again, that's like making every man in America, and woman for that matter, register as a sex offender at birth.
[00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:44.480]  Because you might be a sex offender.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.061]  And I don't know how people can defend this.
[00:28:46.421 --> 00:28:49.023]  Radio, TV, everywhere.
[00:28:49.263 --> 00:28:50.864]  The talking heads in unison.
[00:28:51.344 --> 00:28:55.247]  And most of them don't get talking points, they just know to parrot whatever they've been told.
[00:28:55.707 --> 00:28:56.808]  Most people in life
[00:28:57.395 --> 00:29:03.663]  decide to be parrots and repeat whatever the establishment says and that they'll move up the ranks of power.
[00:29:04.668 --> 00:29:07.450]  Okay, this is how unofficial talking points work.
[00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:19.419]  And then the government's just got to have a few key PR people and a few key positions, and then that's what the CIA called the declassified program that got declassified in the 70s, Operation Mockingbird, Operation Mockingbird.
[00:29:19.819 --> 00:29:31.928]  They had a few thousand key reporters, key editors, key national newscasters, who were in the employ of the government, who would put out propaganda, and then the Mockingbirds would just copy what, quote, the big shots do.
[00:29:32.708 --> 00:29:33.509]  Well, I don't do that.
[00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:38.282]  You can mockingbird all day that the police aren't out of control in this country.
[00:29:38.582 --> 00:29:43.744]  You can mockingbird all day that open borders and unlimited illegal aliens is good.
[00:29:43.764 --> 00:29:44.804]  The people know it isn't.
[00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:53.487]  You can mockingbird all day that the toll roads on existing roads run by a foreign company are good and transponders to taxis down the road are good.
[00:29:53.507 --> 00:29:55.808]  The people are against it, 97%.
[00:29:56.748 --> 00:29:59.089]  You can mockingbird till the cows come home.
[00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:03.272]  You're not going to sell your police state any longer.
[00:30:03.312 --> 00:30:14.461]  You can mockingbird all day that 9-11 was carried out by people in a cave, that they could make NORAD stand down, that they could have CIA drills of flying planes in the buildings at the exact same time that morning.
[00:30:15.342 --> 00:30:16.303]  The exact same targets.
[00:30:16.643 --> 00:30:27.192]  You can mockingbird all you want, but all the New World Order's horses and all the New World Order's men cannot put your stinking New World Order back together again.
[00:30:28.547 --> 00:30:30.008]  Let's go ahead and go to calls here.
[00:30:30.688 --> 00:30:33.710]  And listen, the lines are loaded every time we do this show.
[00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.712]  And so I'm going to run through them quickly so we have time to get to your calls.
[00:30:37.752 --> 00:30:39.093]  I'm not going to be mean to each caller.
[00:30:39.613 --> 00:30:47.537]  I just want to have a chance to get to the next person and still have time to cover the news I've been mentioning and then get into my police state story that happened to me personally.
[00:30:47.917 --> 00:30:50.819]  But right now, let's talk to Ben in Georgetown.
[00:30:51.339 --> 00:30:53.981]  You're on the radio worldwide, my friend.
[00:30:54.021 --> 00:30:54.381]  Go ahead.
[00:30:56.362 --> 00:30:57.182]  Yes, Alex.
[00:30:57.443 --> 00:30:58.063]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[00:30:59.956 --> 00:31:15.069]  I disagree with you on several things, but I did want to thank you for standing up against what Sergeant Sam was saying earlier this week about having the breathalyzers in each car.
[00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:25.557]  He didn't bring up at all what additional costs that would be to all of us who are innocent or guilty until proven innocent.
[00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:27.479]  I just wanted to thank you for
[00:31:28.583 --> 00:31:31.285]  Well, if you ain't got nothing to hide, what's wrong with you?
[00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:36.527]  And then I said, well, why don't you then just put cameras in every home?
[00:31:36.547 --> 00:31:38.188]  And he said, that's ridiculous.
[00:31:38.308 --> 00:31:44.711]  And then one of the other hosts chimed in and said, wait a minute, last week you were saying that the helicopters should be able to look through our walls.
[00:31:44.971 --> 00:31:50.554]  Listen, the Houston police chief six months ago, Houston Chronicle, said that every home needs a camera in it.
[00:31:50.754 --> 00:31:53.816]  These people, it's like Invasion of the Pod people.
[00:31:54.276 --> 00:31:57.798]  They think we're weird because we don't want cameras in every home?
[00:31:58.018 --> 00:32:01.599]  Because we don't want every man to have to be registered as a sex offender?
[00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:02.619]  Every man in America?
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.600]  Because we don't want cameras in our houses?
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.762]  Google has announced they're going to use the built-in cameras that are on all the new Macs.
[00:32:09.342 --> 00:32:11.083]  They're going to... My wife just bought one.
[00:32:11.123 --> 00:32:12.423]  It's got a camera built into it.
[00:32:13.224 --> 00:32:16.965]  They're going to... I'm so mad I can't even talk.
[00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:18.186]  Oh, I don't blame you.
[00:32:18.246 --> 00:32:22.287]  And Google just announced, we don't care what you want, we're going to watch you without asking?
[00:32:22.687 --> 00:32:23.868]  I mean, that really happened!
[00:32:24.713 --> 00:32:25.413]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:32:26.394 --> 00:32:28.655]  No, that's outrageous.
[00:32:28.715 --> 00:32:35.659]  I've wondered about that myself, when that would be coming on, or coming into play.
[00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:39.621]  Well, you heard the exchange with a local host here from the station we broadcast from.
[00:32:39.641 --> 00:32:41.742]  What did you think of the exchange?
[00:32:42.683 --> 00:32:46.065]  Oh, I was very glad you called in.
[00:32:46.085 --> 00:32:51.768]  I mean, everybody's against that, except he's so gung-ho for
[00:32:52.615 --> 00:32:58.560]  I've seen what some of the police have done around here.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:18.215]  There was a guy down on 6th Street who was kind of drunk at once, and a cop raised a baton, and just a natural reflex, the guy put his arm up, you know, the block being hit on the head, and the cop said, oh, you're trying to hit an officer, huh?
[00:33:19.645 --> 00:33:20.146]  No, I know.
[00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.686]  In fact, I've seen that famous video.
[00:33:21.706 --> 00:33:25.528]  That actually happened to a pretty big rock band.
[00:33:25.548 --> 00:33:26.468]  In fact, I interviewed them.
[00:33:27.929 --> 00:33:28.489]  I can't remember their name.
[00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:29.370]  Is it Oza Motley?
[00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.730]  Yeah, it's Oza Motley.
[00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.031]  I actually went and interviewed them.
[00:33:32.071 --> 00:33:33.011]  That was like two years ago.
[00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:33.851]  And there's the video.
[00:33:34.792 --> 00:33:42.775]  Listen, I've got film in my documentary, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, of a naval veteran, no criminal record, farming wife, okay?
[00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:46.797]  I mean, we're talking basically Amish, okay, but not officially Amish.
[00:33:47.443 --> 00:33:53.386]  And she's driving back to her place in Rockmount, Virginia, and the state police have a checkpoint.
[00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:59.008]  And she says, and they're randomly searching cars, she goes, violation Fourth Amendment, you can't do this.
[00:33:59.048 --> 00:34:01.809]  And now we have a video out of the squad car, and they got the little microphones.
[00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.410]  It's a double-edged sword.
[00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:09.153]  And they grab her, she doesn't even touch him, she's smart and goes limp, and they call it going limp assault.
[00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:13.955]  Look, it's like this guy out there at UCLA, and he's gonna end up owning that university now.
[00:34:15.537 --> 00:34:18.759]  They're tasering in, we've timed it out, every 15 seconds on average.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:25.085]  Well, police will tell you, even a big strong man is disabled and can't walk or move usually for about 60 seconds.
[00:34:25.565 --> 00:34:26.906]  And that's in police training manuals.
[00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:34.232]  I went and pulled them up online and we wrote an article about it last week and it got millions of reads on the internet because it was a common sense article.
[00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:40.396]  And we showed, they're saying, get up, get up, get up, and then zap, zap, zap, zap.
[00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:42.076]  You can hear it, you know, ticking off the volts.
[00:34:42.636 --> 00:34:45.577]  And then the guy will wake back up after a minute and start screaming again.
[00:34:45.617 --> 00:34:47.578]  They go, now go ahead and get up.
[00:34:48.698 --> 00:34:52.359]  Well, you can't get up 15 seconds after you've been tasered.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.741]  And finally, he just passes out after they're now admitting over six shocks.
[00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:58.781]  And they just drag him out of there.
[00:34:59.241 --> 00:35:00.102]  And then the police,
[00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:29.237]  put out the manual of the university saying well we call it pain compliance well that's a fancy term for torture and I know that Jack Bauer and and all the big TV shows propagandize you that the big hero tortures children and torturing children's good and this is what America's got to do but see you're not going to run into any real terrorists so but they're all amped up and a lot of them are on steroids so they're going to go ahead and torture your kid now the good news is it's getting so bad they're torturing cops kids
[00:35:29.921 --> 00:35:40.107]  You know, cops send their 18-year-old daughter off to, you know, in one famous case in Miami, and it was a Texas police chief, and they beat the tar out of that guy's daughter.
[00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:41.648]  And so something happened there.
[00:35:41.908 --> 00:35:43.689]  Oh, you heard of God's Child?
[00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:54.375]  I can't tell you how many women I know in Austin where, you know, they pull the good-looking woman over, and they say, come on over here in the bushes, you're going to need to do something here.
[00:35:54.755 --> 00:35:55.875]  And I don't want to hear it.
[00:35:56.075 --> 00:35:58.637]  When I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, outside Dallas,
[00:35:59.278 --> 00:36:01.940]  Everybody knew the sheriff dealt the cocaine and the marijuana.
[00:36:02.821 --> 00:36:03.201]  Okay?
[00:36:03.722 --> 00:36:05.383]  And I wasn't even a druggie, folks.
[00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:06.524]  I didn't even like drugs.
[00:36:07.124 --> 00:36:09.526]  I smoked marijuana a few times and didn't like the way it made me feel.
[00:36:09.806 --> 00:36:14.530]  But everybody knew, oh, the sheriff, yeah, you go buy the drugs from the sheriff's deputies.
[00:36:15.231 --> 00:36:15.791]  Well, guess what?
[00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:18.833]  Jack McWhorter finally got caught and went to prison for that.
[00:36:19.394 --> 00:36:20.335]  So, see, there's a reason.
[00:36:20.455 --> 00:36:23.597]  Oh, oh, by the way, I'm afraid I have the Justice Department's own numbers.
[00:36:23.617 --> 00:36:25.479]  They don't like to publicize, but are public.
[00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:28.301]  And that's that police are twice
[00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.088]  As likely to be involved in all forms of crime.
[00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:33.810]  That's averaged in.
[00:36:34.431 --> 00:36:37.233]  They're over eight times more likely to be involved in prostitution.
[00:36:37.754 --> 00:36:42.318]  CPS is five times more likely to be involved in all forms of crime.
[00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:44.861]  And child molestation, it goes off the chart.
[00:36:45.622 --> 00:36:48.004]  And I'm sorry, those are official numbers.
[00:36:48.124 --> 00:36:49.786]  The numbers convict you.
[00:36:49.826 --> 00:36:50.787]  It's like illegal aliens.
[00:36:51.522 --> 00:36:56.835]  They're involved in more in the Southwest than half of the DWIs and car wrecks.
[00:36:57.116 --> 00:37:00.083]  We'll be right back with the next segment and more of your calls.
[00:37:00.103 --> 00:37:00.564]  Stay with me.
[00:37:01.158 --> 00:37:02.779]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:03.640]  What's wrong?
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.861]  I am so tired.
[00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:07.383]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:37:07.523 --> 00:37:08.624]  I have tried everything.
[00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:10.446]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:37:10.586 --> 00:37:11.727]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:14.169]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:15.890]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.192]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[00:37:18.272 --> 00:37:20.514]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:21.194]  The what?

[00:39:53.982 --> 00:39:55.864]  To Northern Voice Bookstore, P.O.
[00:39:55.904 --> 00:39:59.967]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[00:40:00.347 --> 00:40:02.428]  Investments and securities involve the risk of loss.
[00:40:02.669 --> 00:40:04.870]  You may not think of yourself as being affluent.

[00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:10.875]  But it doesn't matter what kind of car you drive or the home you live in.
[00:40:11.235 --> 00:40:11.535]  I'm good to go.
[00:40:29.121 --> 00:40:29.541]  I think so.
[00:40:52.176 --> 00:40:53.176]  Pick up the phone now.

[00:41:15.802 --> 00:41:17.923]  It's about right versus wrong.

[00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:30.933]  You're my only hope.
[00:41:34.415 --> 00:41:35.897]  Okay, Trey added that.
[00:41:35.937 --> 00:41:36.957]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:41:37.478 --> 00:41:40.520]  So, uh... Stop it.
[00:41:41.801 --> 00:41:42.862]  He says he's very bored.
[00:41:43.102 --> 00:41:44.542]  Yeah, I bet you are having a good time.
[00:41:45.263 --> 00:41:48.044]  Alright, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:41:48.104 --> 00:41:48.844]  And I was just joking.
[00:41:48.864 --> 00:41:49.545]  Pretty good job there.
[00:41:50.025 --> 00:41:51.726]  Okay, let's run through a whole bunch of calls.
[00:41:52.106 --> 00:41:54.307]  I said I'd go quickly and I didn't.
[00:41:54.927 --> 00:41:59.369]  Let's go ahead and talk to another John here in the Austin area.
[00:41:59.449 --> 00:42:00.870]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:01.310]  Welcome.
[00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:01.710]  Go ahead.
[00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.631]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:04.111]  Good, sir.
[00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:05.872]  Please make it quick because I want to get to everybody else.
[00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:24.292]  Okay, well when you're talking about police corruption, you being an Austinite, could you explain to everyone out there in Austin, Texas, how many police officers in the past 20 years who have been convicted of child molesting, prostitution running, and also major criminal activity?
[00:42:25.013 --> 00:42:30.336]  Well, I would say that's a testament that Austin isn't completely corrupt, but so many of them have gone to prison.
[00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:33.077]  And this is very delicate, I want to be clear here.
[00:42:33.524 --> 00:42:36.406]  Okay, I'm not against the individual police.
[00:42:36.526 --> 00:42:37.746]  I'm against the system.
[00:42:37.846 --> 00:42:45.370]  And whereas in the past, all over the country, they would prosecute bad cops to try to, you know, have a clean organization.
[00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:58.597]  Now, nationwide and worldwide, we see the opposite happening, where the corrupt are protected, and then you end up with a big city, you know, corrupt mafia type system, where the government basically is taken over by the mafia.
[00:42:58.617 --> 00:43:02.459]  But yes, Austin is very well known for the fact that
[00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:12.753]  Most of the horrors are run, or at least having to pay payoffs to their pimps, which are the Detective Squad, yes.
[00:43:12.853 --> 00:43:13.993]  Yes, Device Squad.
[00:43:14.013 --> 00:43:14.654]  Device Squad.
[00:43:14.694 --> 00:43:17.974]  Remember 20, 25 years ago, Alex, you used to actually trust a cop?
[00:43:18.014 --> 00:43:18.715]  Now you can't.
[00:43:19.275 --> 00:43:25.036]  Because it would rather bust you for watering your lawn on the wrong day than bust the crack outs across the street.
[00:43:25.854 --> 00:43:29.818]  Well, sir, for those that are ignorant, you see, I'm kind of getting ahead of myself.
[00:43:30.379 --> 00:43:32.782]  It's wrong for me to talk about this without taking my time.
[00:43:33.222 --> 00:43:36.546]  I actually wrote, this weekend, four pages.
[00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:40.430]  Four pages, right here, of just notes, okay?
[00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:42.292]  Let me give people some meat and potatoes.
[00:43:45.095 --> 00:43:58.680]  56 black people, no criminal records, no drugs found, one racist cop who went from town to town, who would then double as the informant, getting these big cash reward payoffs for sending innocent people to prison.
[00:43:59.141 --> 00:43:59.521]  Okay?
[00:44:00.301 --> 00:44:01.842]  Take Houston two years ago.
[00:44:02.002 --> 00:44:03.362]  Police chief had to step down.
[00:44:03.802 --> 00:44:05.063]  Thousands of cases.
[00:44:05.123 --> 00:44:07.404]  The drug lab wouldn't even do tests.
[00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:09.485]  The crime lab wouldn't even do tests.
[00:44:09.945 --> 00:44:11.285]  Everyone was found guilty.
[00:44:11.325 --> 00:44:13.086]  They would just always certify it.
[00:44:13.547 --> 00:44:19.173]  As drugs, or they would certify they found the blood, or they found the hair, or the fibers.
[00:44:19.853 --> 00:44:20.534]  Take Dallas.
[00:44:20.574 --> 00:44:23.477]  Let's just take Texas examples, okay?
[00:44:23.497 --> 00:44:25.198]  It gets a lot worse in other parts of the country.
[00:44:25.278 --> 00:44:33.426]  Dallas, they would pull over nice cars, and throw bags of chalk in the back, and say it was cocaine, and seize the car and the house without due process.
[00:44:33.446 --> 00:44:36.810]  Now let me ask you as Americans, how do they take your car and your house,
[00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.451]  Without due process.
[00:44:38.671 --> 00:44:40.232]  Asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:44:40.712 --> 00:44:42.053]  Totally unconstitutional.
[00:44:42.333 --> 00:44:43.313]  Totally un-American.
[00:44:43.373 --> 00:44:45.634]  It's like something an African dictator would do.
[00:44:46.915 --> 00:44:51.758]  In fact, it's come out in the Seattle Times, Seattle Post-Intelligence, and Seattle Weekly.
[00:44:52.258 --> 00:44:56.060]  Big reports I've had city council members on, ACLU on.
[00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:01.073]  In some areas of the city, the majority of bars are owned by the police.
[00:45:01.153 --> 00:45:01.714]  Why is that?
[00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:04.856]  Because only cops are allowed in an unofficial rule to own bars.
[00:45:05.257 --> 00:45:05.897]  And why is that?
[00:45:06.257 --> 00:45:09.920]  Cops sell COPS COCAINE in the bar bathroom!
[00:45:10.281 --> 00:45:15.645]  They don't even have an informant prep somebody up now and sell it to somebody.
[00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:17.126]  And then they grab the bar.
[00:45:17.426 --> 00:45:23.468]  I'm talking about multi-million dollar bars with, you know, brass and marble tables and big screen TVs.
[00:45:23.669 --> 00:45:30.091]  And then they would allow it to be, quote, auctioned off in closed auctions to the police in New Orleans.
[00:45:30.412 --> 00:45:34.113]  I mean, excuse me, I was thinking of another city where they did the same thing, in Seattle.
[00:45:35.154 --> 00:45:36.654]  So, so, oh, and then New Orleans.
[00:45:36.714 --> 00:45:37.635]  It's the worst in the country.
[00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:39.756]  That's a whole, that's next on my list.
[00:45:41.591 --> 00:45:45.616]  Again, the Founding Fathers said it over and over and over again.
[00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:47.478]  You cannot trust the government.
[00:45:47.718 --> 00:45:49.200]  You've got to keep it small.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.982]  You've got to keep control of it.
[00:45:51.202 --> 00:45:53.545]  Because there are so many criminals in society.
[00:45:54.186 --> 00:45:58.070]  Smart criminals aren't out breaking into your window at night to steal your stereo.
[00:45:58.411 --> 00:46:00.153]  Smart criminals go to college.
[00:46:00.495 --> 00:46:02.176]  They get a badge, they get a gun.
[00:46:02.196 --> 00:46:04.718]  Now listen, cops aren't even the worst.
[00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:08.281]  In fact, cops statistically are low level for crime.
[00:46:09.122 --> 00:46:11.484]  These are official federal numbers.
[00:46:13.505 --> 00:46:15.787]  Go take criminology, just go study it.
[00:46:16.447 --> 00:46:17.408]  These are mainstream numbers.
[00:46:17.748 --> 00:46:21.451]  Police are twice as likely to be involved in all forms of crime.
[00:46:22.808 --> 00:46:28.873]  But most of those numbers are driven up because of drug dealing, prostitution, things they come in contact with.
[00:46:28.893 --> 00:46:31.015]  You know, it's hard for an immoral society.
[00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.536]  And we're turning into scum, folks.
[00:46:32.576 --> 00:46:33.617]  Our police are going to be scum, too.
[00:46:34.232 --> 00:46:41.355]  But the problem is, you see, they are able to get away with more and more and more and more because they have that officialdom.
[00:46:41.555 --> 00:46:43.616]  Because they investigate themselves.
[00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:47.518]  It's like mosquitoes breed in stagnant water.
[00:46:47.778 --> 00:46:49.439]  Well, government is stagnant water.
[00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:52.960]  Crime breeds where it can't be rooted out.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.922]  Where there's no sunshine that is the best disinfectant, okay?
[00:46:58.001 --> 00:47:01.603]  CPS, and this was on the cover of Time Magazine, what, six years ago?
[00:47:01.663 --> 00:47:03.224]  And since then, the number has even gone up higher.
[00:47:03.264 --> 00:47:12.549]  Child Protective Services, nationally, are five times more likely to abuse and rape children.
[00:47:13.449 --> 00:47:13.910]  Don't believe me?
[00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:14.750]  Just type it into Google.
[00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.351]  You'll get mainstream news, okay?
[00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:20.013]  But again, back of the paper, average of five times
[00:47:20.572 --> 00:47:23.054]  Now, there's a group even higher for molestation.
[00:47:23.394 --> 00:47:24.435]  Truancy officers.
[00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:27.798]  And if you don't like it, clean up your industry.
[00:47:28.218 --> 00:47:29.459]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[00:47:30.481 --> 00:47:31.241]  But again, think about it.
[00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:36.443]  If you're a pervert, if you're a pedophile, you want to be in a position around children.
[00:47:36.503 --> 00:47:40.504]  It's just like you're many times more likely to be a pedophile if you want to be a scout leader.
[00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:45.025]  Or if you want to be involved in something where you're around children.
[00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:49.047]  Now, that looks bad for other good scout leaders, and still most of them are good.
[00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:53.788]  That looks bad for cops, it looks bad for truancy officers, it looks bad for CPS.
[00:47:54.068 --> 00:47:55.249]  Well, I'm sorry!
[00:47:55.429 --> 00:47:57.129]  It's just a fact.
[00:47:57.269 --> 00:47:59.670]  Also, it's the psychology.
[00:48:00.842 --> 00:48:04.087]  There are different types who join the police force, okay?
[00:48:04.508 --> 00:48:07.012]  And get into government positions of power, period.
[00:48:08.133 --> 00:48:12.260]  You got the individual who really wants to help somebody, and that's the majority of police.
[00:48:12.921 --> 00:48:23.907]  Then you've got another group that is a large portion who got out of the military, don't want to work with the Postal Service, don't want to work as a jail guard, their daddy was a cop, they're going to go be a cop.
[00:48:23.927 --> 00:48:34.672]  To them it's just a job, it's a culture, and they try to help people, but really they're just thinking about the weekend, living for the weekend, to go out to the country bar and pick up a jilly.
[00:48:35.292 --> 00:48:36.413]  That group I can deal with.
[00:48:36.593 --> 00:48:39.294]  And then you've got the criminals.
[00:48:40.135 --> 00:48:42.056]  And that's a small group, but still,
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.044]  I mean, depending on the numbers, we're talking 6, 7, 8 percent.
[00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:47.866]  Some areas of the country, much higher.
[00:48:48.126 --> 00:48:52.272]  That are just criminals who want to be able to carry out crime operations, okay?
[00:48:52.952 --> 00:48:55.656]  Then, you've got the really bad group.
[00:48:56.261 --> 00:48:58.443]  And that is the control freak bullies.
[00:48:58.804 --> 00:49:15.241]  I mean, I remember guys, I saw the tattoos all over them on roids, you know, who were 19 years old at the gym, who were starting fights at the gym, and my gosh, I saw them a few years later on 6th Street, shaking people down in black gloves, stomping around in uncontrolled roid rages.
[00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:20.094]  I mean, I've had one of these guys pull over one of my good friends, who's a manager at Home Depot.
[00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:30.903]  He is paralyzed, chest down, and one of these cops in a Roid Rage, and he has arms the size of my thigh, and I've got pretty big thighs, and he goes, what are these?
[00:49:30.923 --> 00:49:32.144]  He goes, these are hand controls.
[00:49:32.184 --> 00:49:32.824]  Get out of the car.
[00:49:32.965 --> 00:49:33.445]  I can't.
[00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:35.126]  My wife's got to get my chair out.
[00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:35.807]  You liar!
[00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:37.128]  He drags him out, beats him up.
[00:49:37.408 --> 00:49:38.429]  That guy gets promoted!
[00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:39.490]  Okay?
[00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.631]  And they, even in the trial, even got the tape of it.
[00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:44.834]  And they said, well, he didn't, you know, he's a god.
[00:49:45.552 --> 00:49:45.852]  Okay.
[00:49:46.813 --> 00:49:48.575]  In tyranny, you're a slave.
[00:49:48.775 --> 00:49:50.476]  In tyranny, you have no recourse.
[00:49:50.516 --> 00:49:51.637]  You have no due process.
[00:49:51.677 --> 00:49:52.999]  How does the IRS take your house?
[00:49:53.039 --> 00:49:53.719]  Take your bank account?
[00:49:53.939 --> 00:49:54.800]  There was no trial.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.601]  There was no judge.
[00:49:55.621 --> 00:49:56.362]  There was no jury.
[00:49:57.062 --> 00:49:59.344]  How does CPS take your child without due process?
[00:49:59.384 --> 00:49:59.965]  No trial.
[00:50:00.465 --> 00:50:01.486]  Nothing's being alleged.
[00:50:01.526 --> 00:50:02.947]  They just do it themselves.
[00:50:03.007 --> 00:50:03.648]  It's called tyranny.
[00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:06.553]  Do they just take your boat?
[00:50:06.633 --> 00:50:07.313]  Take your home?
[00:50:07.593 --> 00:50:08.574]  No drugs found?
[00:50:08.594 --> 00:50:11.474]  You know the famous case up in Waco, state police.
[00:50:11.854 --> 00:50:12.955]  Remember that a few years ago?
[00:50:13.035 --> 00:50:16.155]  Pull over an eighty-something year old woman who had five grand in her purse?
[00:50:16.435 --> 00:50:17.295]  They just took it.
[00:50:18.436 --> 00:50:20.696]  They just took it from her and of course they got in trouble.
[00:50:20.756 --> 00:50:22.897]  You hear about a few of the cases.
[00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:26.017]  Well you just shouldn't have cash in your purse.
[00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:27.217]  You see?
[00:50:27.517 --> 00:50:30.618]  Well that's how old-timers are because they're not as stupid as the young generation.
[00:50:30.838 --> 00:50:32.098]  They don't trust credit cards.
[00:50:32.338 --> 00:50:35.139]  They don't... when they go on a trip they carry some money with them.
[00:50:35.822 --> 00:50:36.222]  All right.
[00:50:37.323 --> 00:50:38.324]  I'm already digressing.
[00:50:39.104 --> 00:50:40.485]  I'm totally out of control here.
[00:50:40.925 --> 00:50:42.906]  Let's go ahead and jam one call in.
[00:50:43.887 --> 00:50:45.968]  Let's talk to Judy N. Bastrop.
[00:50:46.008 --> 00:50:48.510]  Judy, you're on the air calling in to KLBJ 590.
[00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:49.190]  Go ahead.
[00:50:50.951 --> 00:50:51.651]  Okay, Alex?
[00:50:51.811 --> 00:50:52.192]  Move quick.
[00:50:52.212 --> 00:50:53.112]  I've got to break here in a second.
[00:50:53.452 --> 00:50:53.893]  Okay.
[00:50:54.353 --> 00:50:55.594]  I'm grateful you're back.
[00:50:55.874 --> 00:50:57.375]  I'd haven't known where you were.
[00:50:57.395 --> 00:51:02.558]  I want to know how to succeed Texas from the Union.
[00:51:02.658 --> 00:51:03.138]  Succeed?
[00:51:03.718 --> 00:51:04.419]  Succeed.
[00:51:05.968 --> 00:51:06.608]  My mood.
[00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:08.049]  Yes, I understand.
[00:51:09.009 --> 00:51:13.031]  Well, Texas truly opted into the union.
[00:51:13.051 --> 00:51:17.253]  It's known as the Lone Star State because it has a contract to opt out.
[00:51:17.473 --> 00:51:22.616]  But really, that designation is false because New Hampshire has Article 10.
[00:51:22.796 --> 00:51:25.157]  Just type New Hampshire Constitution into Google.
[00:51:25.237 --> 00:51:26.637]  Look at Article 10, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:27.098 --> 00:51:29.979]  Yes, I even know other states' constitutions.
[00:51:30.579 --> 00:51:31.540]  Hey, it's good to hear from you.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.140]  I appreciate it.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:32.740]  You know what?
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.601]  I'll answer that question when we get back on the other side.
[00:51:35.327 --> 00:51:36.568]  And I am for secession.
[00:51:37.169 --> 00:51:40.271]  But not some Johnny Reb shout will rise again.
[00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:43.414]  I'm talking about... Well, I'll tell you what I'm talking about when we get back.
[00:51:44.715 --> 00:51:46.417]  We'll get through all your calls when we start the next hour.
[00:51:46.677 --> 00:51:48.719]  Then I'll rant about what happened to me this weekend.
[00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:49.460]  The police state.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:49.880]  Stay with us.
[00:51:50.618 --> 00:51:51.798]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:51.898 --> 00:51:56.700]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.721]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:03.842]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:10.185]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[00:52:10.365 --> 00:52:11.925]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:11.965 --> 00:52:14.346]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:21.724 --> 00:52:22.744]  Looking for profit?
[00:52:22.804 --> 00:52:24.165]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:24.525 --> 00:52:27.366]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:27.766 --> 00:52:35.008]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.408 --> 00:52:38.809]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:52:39.149 --> 00:52:40.669]  Secure your position today.
[00:52:40.989 --> 00:52:42.210]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.470]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:53.283 --> 00:52:59.666]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:52:59.826 --> 00:53:01.627]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:53:02.627 --> 00:53:04.108]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.308 --> 00:53:05.148]  Defending our borders.
[00:53:05.708 --> 00:53:07.509]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:07.709 --> 00:53:09.170]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.231]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.411 --> 00:53:13.512]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:53:14.092 --> 00:53:16.333]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:17.222 --> 00:53:21.784]  Call Alex now toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:33.751]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:33.851 --> 00:53:40.435]  Part of a larger national police state move by the federal government has turned our states into little puppet dictatorships.
[00:53:41.755 --> 00:53:44.917]  Mothers Against Drunk Driving wants
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:50.422]  Everyone to be treated as if they're criminals, as if they've proven innocent with breathalyzers built into all cars.
[00:53:50.842 --> 00:53:52.883]  By the way, they're the front group for all of this.
[00:53:53.423 --> 00:53:57.624]  I saw stories 5, 6, 7 years ago, the automakers saying they were going to do this.
[00:53:57.984 --> 00:54:01.806]  By the way, new cars will all have cameras mounted, also watching you.
[00:54:04.438 --> 00:54:06.800]  I mean, it makes 1984 look like child's play.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.501]  We'll be talking about that as part of a larger discussion.
[00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:15.065]  I'm going to spend about 20 minutes or two segments or so on the police state in America and where it's all going.
[00:54:15.105 --> 00:54:23.290]  But right now, let's get some of these callers I've been holding a while out of the way, because I really always enjoy hearing from you in all the different directions that you take us in.
[00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.071]  Patrick, calling in from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:54:26.111 --> 00:54:26.792]  Thanks for holding.
[00:54:27.092 --> 00:54:28.012]  Welcome here on the air.
[00:54:28.733 --> 00:54:29.653]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:30.314]  Hello, sir.
[00:54:30.334 --> 00:54:31.915]  I wanted to talk about
[00:54:32.816 --> 00:54:44.253]  The statement that the Chancellor of UCLA made about the incident, he actually said that, okay guys, let's not jump to conclusions about what happened.
[00:54:44.273 --> 00:54:46.396]  The video that you see is...
[00:54:47.552 --> 00:54:48.813]  It doesn't really show everything.
[00:54:49.153 --> 00:54:50.974]  And this is kind of like, you know, strange to me.
[00:54:50.994 --> 00:54:55.096]  Now, for those that have been hiding under a rock, let's be clear.
[00:54:56.056 --> 00:55:05.120]  Somebody with a camera phone shot video that went on for many, many minutes, longer than what National News showed you, but it is online at YouTube.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.361]  We have it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:07.021 --> 00:55:18.388]  Of this student who was trying to leave, who didn't want to be in Nazi Germany and show his ID as part of the new freedom, you know, line up and show us your IDs, and now it's going to be on the streets of America, not just in your cars or airports or schools.
[00:55:18.688 --> 00:55:19.649]  They want to do the same thing.
[00:55:19.929 --> 00:55:27.494]  So they tasered him, and then because he didn't submit, and they call it, you know, basically pain submission, their word for torture,
[00:55:28.363 --> 00:55:33.486]  That they kept shocking him, even when he couldn't get up 15 to 20 seconds, depending on which shock.
[00:55:34.386 --> 00:55:37.168]  Some of them were 30 seconds average, but the average was about 15 seconds.
[00:55:37.468 --> 00:55:39.069]  I mean, obviously he was incapacitated.
[00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:42.110]  They were still shocking him for their central power trip.
[00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:45.732]  These are weak people who always wanted power, were bullies.
[00:55:45.752 --> 00:55:47.333]  You know, they beat up smaller children.
[00:55:47.573 --> 00:55:50.155]  Then the smaller children's brother would come beat them up.
[00:55:50.395 --> 00:55:55.278]  They swore to defeat the actual strong people, and now they get to be in that position to do it.
[00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:55.958]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:56.678 --> 00:56:11.945]  Yeah, it's just like, you know, now that you see that the, you know, the school's administration is trying to spin the story just like, you know, a police chief would try to spin the story of, you know, the, you know... Well, they tried to spin Padilla being right for two hours with a broomstick.
[00:56:13.266 --> 00:56:14.587]  With blood pouring out everywhere.
[00:56:14.607 --> 00:56:17.989]  I mean blood pouring out, raping some innocent, totally innocent it turned out.
[00:56:18.249 --> 00:56:19.410]  Just all it's routine.
[00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:22.272]  And then finally out of hundreds of police that saw it.
[00:56:22.832 --> 00:56:25.574]  This was in the middle of the New York City substation.
[00:56:25.854 --> 00:56:28.595]  Hundreds of cops were in there, screaming for hours.
[00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:29.696]  Folks, it was admitted.
[00:56:30.076 --> 00:56:32.158]  I mean how do you torture someone for hours?
[00:56:32.798 --> 00:56:34.179]  With a broken broomstick?
[00:56:35.139 --> 00:56:36.340]  And they tried to spin that.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.342]  You cannot spin raping someone with a broomstick.
[00:56:41.212 --> 00:56:49.120]  Yeah, it's just, you know, I don't think that we can even trust the administration of these schools to even protect the students now.
[00:56:49.661 --> 00:57:01.874]  There's actually a video on YouTube as well showing a rally in Santa Monica College and the cops basically told one of the students that was filming, you can't film us and you can't film the rally going.
[00:57:02.276 --> 00:57:04.297]  Even though, I mean, it's a public college.
[00:57:04.337 --> 00:57:10.982]  And again, that's all color of law, and then they never arrest you for saying no to the filming and going ahead and filming.
[00:57:11.302 --> 00:57:14.164]  They then assault you, in the old days you just got beat up.
[00:57:14.504 --> 00:57:16.966]  Then they charge you on top of it.
[00:57:17.206 --> 00:57:21.128]  But the good news is they're getting caught over and over and over again framing people.
[00:57:21.148 --> 00:57:27.733]  And they think it's so normal to frame somebody, they even turn in the squad car videos that are then shown in court to prove it.
[00:57:28.273 --> 00:57:30.955]  Now again, the corrupt establishment that owns this country,
[00:57:31.417 --> 00:57:39.304]  The foreign banks that own this country want thugs in power, so they encourage it, they don't support good cops, they promote bad cops.
[00:57:39.964 --> 00:57:45.649]  And so, whereas you've got bad people in society, when they get into government, they cannot be restrained.
[00:57:45.809 --> 00:57:47.130]  That's called tyranny.
[00:57:47.492 --> 00:57:50.175]  Tyranny always happens.
[00:57:50.315 --> 00:57:53.179]  We always had tyranny in this country.
[00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:55.021]  It was just against blacks or somebody else.
[00:57:55.381 --> 00:57:57.283]  A limited group had a limited freedom.
[00:57:57.564 --> 00:58:02.189]  And look at all the freedom and all of the wealth that was produced because of that.
[00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:04.742]  Now, that's disappearing.
[00:58:05.202 --> 00:58:07.263]  Now, that's being erased.
[00:58:07.444 --> 00:58:15.428]  And then, again, you've got the Dudley Do-Right cops that think it's their right to do this, and some of them are the worst, because they think they're making you get in line.
[00:58:15.468 --> 00:58:17.269]  They're showing you who's in boss.
[00:58:17.289 --> 00:58:24.113]  You know, they were drill sergeants in the military, and now you're a young recruit, and you're going to be shown.
[00:58:24.173 --> 00:58:26.034]  You're going to be made to pay.
[00:58:27.665 --> 00:58:33.447]  And by the way, I've had police tell me to turn cameras off when I'm... And I don't get 20 feet up when they're searching some car.
[00:58:33.467 --> 00:58:35.588]  I'll be 50 yards, 60 yards away.
[00:58:35.608 --> 00:58:37.049]  I don't get in their area.
[00:58:37.129 --> 00:58:38.470]  I don't interfere with what they're doing.
[00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:40.470]  And I'll have them come over and go, turn that off.
[00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:41.311]  And I say, no.
[00:58:42.451 --> 00:58:43.512]  And they say, turn it off.
[00:58:44.492 --> 00:58:45.753]  And they start pulling their gun out.
[00:58:45.773 --> 00:58:46.413]  And I go, listen.
[00:58:46.969 --> 00:58:49.652]  I know the law, and you can beat the rat, but you won't beat the ride.
[00:58:49.732 --> 00:58:58.040]  I will sue you, and I won't stop, and you're not immune when you step outside the Constitution, and you want to go ahead and engage in official arrest, and I don't get mad.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.582]  I say it very coldly.
[00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:04.427]  A lot of you have seen the video of when I do this, and I got cold with this female state trooper.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.241]  And boy, her partner was just, he walked off and they were arguing back there.
[00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:09.281]  I could hear it.
[00:59:09.541 --> 00:59:10.821]  Saying, leave this guy alone.
[00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:16.002]  Because he was older than what, it was some stupid, looked like a rookie state trooper.
[00:59:16.402 --> 00:59:18.463]  And I tell you, you did the best thing in your life.
[00:59:19.043 --> 00:59:21.723]  The best thing in your life, leaving my family alone, you witch.
[00:59:22.443 --> 00:59:24.744]  Because I'll own you, okay?
[00:59:25.304 --> 00:59:26.004]  I'll own you.
[00:59:26.404 --> 00:59:30.125]  Because I am the type of vindictive person that will take you to court.
[00:59:30.749 --> 00:59:33.692]  Okay, that will take out ads in the newspaper.
[00:59:33.972 --> 00:59:35.673]  You mess with my family.
[00:59:35.974 --> 00:59:38.235]  You see, I don't worship the state like you do.
[00:59:38.576 --> 00:59:39.577]  I love my family.
[00:59:40.437 --> 00:59:42.839]  And it was sick, folks.
[00:59:42.899 --> 00:59:43.680]  It was sick.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.884]  And again, words can't even describe just the insanity of it.
[00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:50.286]  But I will be telling you about that a little bit later.
[00:59:50.326 --> 00:59:51.006]  Thank you for the call.
[00:59:51.507 --> 00:59:53.809]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:59:54.669 --> 00:59:57.091]  Let's talk to Mike in Maryland, holding like a trooper.
[00:59:57.131 --> 00:59:57.772]  Mike, welcome.
[00:59:58.584 --> 00:59:59.925]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:04.827]  I sensibly wanted to ask you about the best way to spread the truth about 9-11.
[01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:07.388]  We have a 9-11 Truth Group here, if I may plug it, in the D.C.
[01:00:07.428 --> 01:00:13.891]  area, dc911truth.org, and I hand out videos to people.
[01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:20.293]  The attack of the police state and our attack on civil liberties is multitudinous.
[01:00:20.313 --> 01:00:26.416]  I try to tell people about the American Community Survey, about Codex Alimentarius,
[01:00:27.086 --> 01:00:28.826]  About the New Freedom Initiative?
[01:00:29.447 --> 01:00:33.027]  About, you know, just the Enemy Combatant Act?
[01:00:33.487 --> 01:00:36.388]  Some people, believe me, some people just walk away and leave.
[01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:36.848]  Well, yeah.
[01:00:36.888 --> 01:00:39.449]  I mean, I have the official laws signed.
[01:00:40.049 --> 01:00:41.429]  America is dead.
[01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:51.191]  And still, the general public is so cowardly and so pathetic that they deny the reality when it's in their face.
[01:00:51.991 --> 01:00:55.252]  I walk up to Total Strangers, and we've got a guy here that
[01:00:56.093 --> 01:01:00.537]  I'm sure you remember, before Katrina struck the Delta Coast, they had a docudrama on the cable channels.
[01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:24.842]  That almost mirrored exactly what happened.
[01:01:24.862 --> 01:01:26.663]  Well, Negan the Mayor was even in it.
[01:01:27.304 --> 01:01:35.448]  You know, I don't know, there are coincidences in this world, but so many times it's really scary.
[01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:47.675]  I mean, take the Fox TV special where the government hijacks a jet with people on it by remote control to crash it in the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan to invade.
[01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:50.137]  That aired, what, five and a half months before 9-11?
[01:01:51.374 --> 01:02:06.104]  And in the Fox TV show, Lone Gum, and it was the pilot episode, spent off of the X-Files, in that program, the government runs a drill of hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center to confuse the rest of the government so they can get away with it.
[01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:09.586]  The exact thing happened on the morning of 9-11.
[01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:14.469]  Associated Press, USA Today, two months after I reported on it, broke the story.
[01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:15.550]  Quote, broke it.
[01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.551]  That's the kind of Pentagon sources I have.
[01:02:19.046 --> 01:02:20.186]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[01:02:20.206 --> 01:02:30.749]  When we get back, Lucas, Richard, Juan, and many others, I'm going to get to you, but I need to spend a segment and a half or so getting into the police state, telling the story of what happened to me with the state police.
[01:02:31.629 --> 01:02:40.551]  It was actually on Thanksgiving afternoon, end of the evening, driving down to Port Aransas to, well, let my children build sandcastles.
[01:02:41.445 --> 01:02:44.146]  And it was just indicative of what this country's turned into.
[01:02:44.566 --> 01:02:46.907]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:02:47.267 --> 01:02:50.187]  We'll be right back from deep in the heart of Texas, going out worldwide.
[01:02:51.828 --> 01:02:55.869]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:59.490]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:03.131]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:03:03.402 --> 01:03:06.643]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:03:06.663 --> 01:03:12.144]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:03:12.164 --> 01:03:21.806]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:03:21.926 --> 01:03:23.207]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:03:23.247 --> 01:03:28.708]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:03:29.102 --> 01:03:33.644]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:03:33.664 --> 01:03:35.085]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:03:35.265 --> 01:03:39.287]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.228]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:03:53.266 --> 01:03:54.308]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:03:54.708 --> 01:04:00.215]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:04:00.776 --> 01:04:01.277]  That's right.
[01:04:01.597 --> 01:04:03.880]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:11.370]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:19.609]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:24.856]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:30.532]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:31.332 --> 01:04:35.453]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:36.073]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:36.113 --> 01:04:38.034]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:04:38.114 --> 01:04:38.394]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:38.714 --> 01:04:38.974]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:52.057 --> 01:04:55.799]  Are rising gas prices flattening your wallet?
[01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:58.321]  Try Royal Purple high-performance motor oil.
[01:04:58.341 --> 01:04:58.441]  What?
[01:04:58.701 --> 01:04:59.141]  How's that?
[01:04:59.202 --> 01:05:05.746]  Yes, independent tests by respected universities show Royal Purple reduces fuel consumption by as much as 5%.
[01:05:07.447 --> 01:05:12.190]  That means Royal Purple can deliver better gas mileage for a fatter wallet.
[01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.171]  Go to RoyalPurple.com for details.
[01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:19.354]  That's Royal Purple, the high-performance motor oil that outperforms
[01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:23.150]  Oil is oil.
[01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:24.771]  Don't kid yourself!
[01:05:24.931 --> 01:05:28.073]  Technology makes better oils possible, like Royal Purple.
[01:05:28.233 --> 01:05:31.395]  Royal Purple reduces friction and increases film strength.
[01:05:31.716 --> 01:05:37.720]  Go to RoyalPurple.com and you'll find independent test results from North Carolina and Oklahoma states.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.501]  Not hype, just facts.
[01:05:39.781 --> 01:05:40.521]  What's in it for you?
[01:05:40.662 --> 01:05:45.365]  Superior protection, fewer oil changes, more horsepower, torque, and better gas mileage.
[01:05:45.505 --> 01:05:51.108]  Find Royal Purple at Napa, O'Reilly's, your local high-performance center, and RoyalPurple.com.
[01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:51.709]  Today!
[01:05:52.169 --> 01:05:55.754]  It's here!
[01:05:55.975 --> 01:06:00.721]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:06:01.102 --> 01:06:08.672]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:06:09.443 --> 01:06:16.486]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:06:16.886 --> 01:06:28.291]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:32.133]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:34.494]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:34.854 --> 01:06:38.616]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:51.143]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:59.749]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:06.594]  Alex Jones is deep in the heart of Texas, and he wants to talk to you.
[01:07:07.234 --> 01:07:10.816]  Toll free at 877-590-5525.
[01:07:13.398 --> 01:07:15.639]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.263]  Alright, let me go over the police state.
[01:07:21.283 --> 01:07:24.204]  Again, I could have spent hours on this, but we just don't have time.
[01:07:24.244 --> 01:07:26.606]  We'll cut a break, come back, and get into more of your calls.
[01:07:28.797 --> 01:07:37.884]  A police state is where there's no due process, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, where the government and its functionaries are absolute rulers over the people.
[01:07:38.164 --> 01:07:41.947]  Now, in every society, in human culture, this is always the norm.
[01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:45.650]  Liberty is almost unknown.
[01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:47.612]  The title weight of tyranny
[01:07:48.152 --> 01:07:50.914]  The consolidation of power always takes place.
[01:07:51.255 --> 01:07:53.016]  Countries always go bad.
[01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:55.698]  I mean, Americans know that in Mexico the police are corrupt.
[01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:57.259]  They shake you down for money.
[01:07:57.519 --> 01:07:58.780]  They shake their own people down.
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.041]  They shoot protesters.
[01:08:00.301 --> 01:08:03.024]  They work for the mafia, which is the government.
[01:08:03.044 --> 01:08:03.304]  Okay?
[01:08:03.344 --> 01:08:05.285]  We know that the police are corrupt in Russia.
[01:08:05.566 --> 01:08:06.987]  We know they're corrupt in China.
[01:08:07.247 --> 01:08:09.969]  We know they're corrupt because as Americans we've studied this.
[01:08:10.289 --> 01:08:10.990]  We've read about it.
[01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:12.451]  But our media will tell us about it.
[01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:15.173]  Foreign countries, but never our own, okay?
[01:08:15.945 --> 01:08:18.606]  Let's go back to Rome 2,000 years ago.
[01:08:19.026 --> 01:08:27.928]  Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon with his legions, goes into Rome, destroys the Republic, and then puts in his puppet dictatorship.
[01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:33.389]  Now, fast forward several hundred years to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in 410.
[01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:39.951]  Basically what happened is, you would have the Praetorian Guard that guarded Caesar.
[01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:46.026]  You would have, basically, the legion that was in Rome that enforced for him.
[01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:50.128]  Well, rather quickly, the police chief, that's why police wear blue today.
[01:08:50.368 --> 01:08:51.869]  The Victorian Guard wore blue.
[01:08:52.329 --> 01:09:04.856]  The police chief started figuring out, hey, if I just kill Caesar, or if I just exile him, I'll just claim he did something, or I'll just go kill him, or I'll just take over, and I'll say I'm Caesar, and I'll make bribes to my lieutenants not to kill me.
[01:09:05.336 --> 01:09:09.979]  Well, pretty soon, in some cases, you had a new Caesar every week, okay?
[01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:15.122]  And then they started splitting Rome up and saying, well there's the Caesar of the East and the Caesar of the West.
[01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:18.764]  And literally everything broke down because why should people produce?
[01:09:19.045 --> 01:09:20.686]  Why should people own businesses?
[01:09:20.726 --> 01:09:21.886]  Why should they own farms?
[01:09:22.427 --> 01:09:27.330]  If the Caesars and their minions were so corrupt that they would take whatever they wanted.
[01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:29.211]  They beat people up, they enslaved them.
[01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:36.255]  Rome didn't have the gladiators and the mass executions and all that stuff in its first years, when it was built up and strong.
[01:09:36.435 --> 01:09:37.575]  I mean, they had laws.
[01:09:37.835 --> 01:09:41.156]  If the police did one thing wrong, they were the ones getting hung.
[01:09:41.516 --> 01:09:41.837]  Okay?
[01:09:42.557 --> 01:09:55.661]  And the magistrates, even though it was quote, centralized and tyrannical, it was well-oiled, and people to have businesses, and to join the military, and to be citizens was encouraged.
[01:09:55.681 --> 01:09:58.602]  And man, they were the Roman Empire, and they took over the known world.
[01:10:00.052 --> 01:10:02.374]  Against, in many cases, armies ten times their size.
[01:10:02.694 --> 01:10:08.099]  But they became corrupt, and no amount of gold and treasure could buy off their enemies.
[01:10:08.139 --> 01:10:16.927]  And the Germans, the German barbarians, and the Austriagoss, the Austrians, and the Gauls, the French, just came in and looted the place in 410, led by Alaric.
[01:10:17.187 --> 01:10:21.831]  Because they were a bunch of corrupt, perfumed twits prancing around in their blue uniforms.
[01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:23.512]  And the Caesar would wear blue.
[01:10:23.832 --> 01:10:24.513]  I wear blue!
[01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:25.554]  I'm the head cop!
[01:10:26.033 --> 01:10:26.313]  Okay?
[01:10:26.513 --> 01:10:27.733]  That's your police state!
[01:10:27.893 --> 01:10:34.475]  They take over in every country, they set themselves up as gods, and they shove machine guns down your throat!
[01:10:35.035 --> 01:10:35.555]  Okay?
[01:10:35.755 --> 01:10:36.856]  That's what's now happened.
[01:10:37.116 --> 01:10:43.177]  But again, they've gotten more sophisticated in society today, and believe me, the system is very afraid of their people.
[01:10:43.417 --> 01:10:53.560]  So when I say cops, today it's CIA, FBI, it's Congress, it's these politicians, they've set themselves up as the kings, as the masters,
[01:10:53.976 --> 01:11:01.358]  They've abolished much of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and they got all this endless PR with our tax money.
[01:11:01.398 --> 01:11:02.959]  It's an armed military.
[01:11:03.099 --> 01:11:04.659]  The local police have been militarized.
[01:11:04.959 --> 01:11:08.300]  They've been federalized through the grants, through the agreements, through the training.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.661]  They brainwashed the police, and I've got to be careful about this.
[01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:13.201]  In fact, I've heard things in the last hour.
[01:11:13.882 --> 01:11:15.062]  I frankly have hurt the country.
[01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:20.869]  I haven't hurt the country as much as the shows that lick the police boots have, but I haven't been as effective as I could.
[01:11:21.089 --> 01:11:23.971]  Because if I just get up here and attack police, that helps the New World Order.
[01:11:24.251 --> 01:11:24.571]  Why?
[01:11:24.651 --> 01:11:25.852]  Oh, they got handbooks on it!
[01:11:26.354 --> 01:11:29.275]  They know the public gets madder and madder as police become corrupt.
[01:11:29.295 --> 01:11:30.275]  They've done it over and over again.
[01:11:30.515 --> 01:11:31.255]  Hitler did this.
[01:11:31.736 --> 01:11:35.657]  So then they go back to the SS, back to the SA, in Germany's case, and go, see?
[01:11:36.037 --> 01:11:36.777]  They hate you.
[01:11:36.837 --> 01:11:38.378]  You've got to stick together even more.
[01:11:38.398 --> 01:11:39.238]  It's like the Mafia.
[01:11:39.298 --> 01:11:40.178]  It's mob psychology.
[01:11:40.478 --> 01:11:42.439]  The Mafia lives together, vacations together.
[01:11:42.639 --> 01:11:43.379]  They intermarry.
[01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.119]  This is how organized crime works.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.060]  You see, they're all against you.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.001]  They're really bad out there.
[01:11:49.241 --> 01:11:50.301]  And you're not with them.
[01:11:50.361 --> 01:11:51.481]  The thin blue line.
[01:11:51.501 --> 01:11:53.762]  Then it's the thin black ski mask line.
[01:11:55.314 --> 01:12:02.796]  Again, the Inquisitors, the Executioners, all throughout history, they were the ones that covered their faces.
[01:12:02.996 --> 01:12:05.157]  They start covering their badges.
[01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:07.778]  This lady who pulled me over wouldn't give me her name or badge number.
[01:12:07.998 --> 01:12:11.159]  And then everything on the ticket is readable, but her name.
[01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:12.739]  Awww.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.381]  You should just notice that she just couldn't seem to get that.
[01:12:16.421 --> 01:12:18.481]  But it doesn't matter, we had a video camera on her.
[01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:20.702]  It took her a while to figure it out, and she panicked.
[01:12:21.222 --> 01:12:21.923]  Once she did.
[01:12:22.323 --> 01:12:24.985]  And so you can do wonders with the old video camera.
[01:12:25.005 --> 01:12:25.945]  I'm pausing it.
[01:12:25.985 --> 01:12:28.927]  In fact, I just got back from the beach a few hours ago.
[01:12:29.527 --> 01:12:31.609]  I haven't had time to put the video on the web.
[01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:33.030]  We did get some of it, the latter part.
[01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:34.611]  It'll be up on the web in the next few days.
[01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:36.152]  I'm going to write a report about it.
[01:12:36.412 --> 01:12:37.513]  And I haven't gotten to that story yet.
[01:12:37.533 --> 01:12:38.273]  I will after the break.
[01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:40.454]  But there's so much history.
[01:12:40.474 --> 01:12:41.375]  See, that's the problem.
[01:12:41.435 --> 01:12:44.497]  Am I against the low-level Roman centurion?
[01:12:44.557 --> 01:12:44.777]  No.
[01:12:46.038 --> 01:12:49.160]  If Rome goes bad, you've got as much to lose as I do.
[01:12:49.813 --> 01:12:57.156]  Okay, I mean, I go deer hunting with cops, a bunch of my family are police, but I'm not naive, and you're not naive either.
[01:12:57.416 --> 01:13:12.783]  And all this propaganda about how you're perfect, and the TV shows where you're all perfect, and, oh, you're so good, and you're... No, that's hurting the image of police, because when bad cops are protected and promoted, it then lets the system get worse and worse for the good police officers.
[01:13:12.983 --> 01:13:15.204]  When you get punished for reporting a bad cop,
[01:13:15.884 --> 01:13:17.606]  That isn't your being a little snitch.
[01:13:17.646 --> 01:13:18.287]  You deserve it.
[01:13:18.567 --> 01:13:23.612]  You were reporting something bad to keep a good image and now you're being punished for it.
[01:13:24.312 --> 01:13:25.654]  That's gang mentality.
[01:13:25.854 --> 01:13:30.138]  You know, yesterday he went and he read it out what you were doing.
[01:13:30.378 --> 01:13:32.120]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.701]  It's a gang mentality.
[01:13:33.902 --> 01:13:36.664]  Go read your own gang psychology.
[01:13:36.964 --> 01:13:38.906]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are used.
[01:13:39.187 --> 01:13:40.488]  But why do I talk about police?
[01:13:40.888 --> 01:13:42.509]  That's where the rubber meets the road.
[01:13:42.609 --> 01:13:50.993]  If we go into full board tyranny, which every signpost, every road marker, every indicator, we are going to something the worst we've ever seen on the planet Earth.
[01:13:51.113 --> 01:13:54.494]  I mean, this sucker's big and mean and bad, and boy, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:13:54.915 --> 01:13:58.256]  I mean, my wife, after this, what happened a few days ago, just wants to leave.
[01:13:58.556 --> 01:13:59.797]  And it wasn't even that big of a deal.
[01:13:59.817 --> 01:14:06.100]  It was just kind of like a cherry on top to see how serious all of this has gotten.
[01:14:07.205 --> 01:14:09.766]  And so number one, police, you're totally brainwashed, okay?
[01:14:09.786 --> 01:14:10.667]  You need to understand that.
[01:14:10.827 --> 01:14:14.209]  Number two, the beat cop and the traffic cop is separate.
[01:14:15.049 --> 01:14:18.731]  I see them changing tires, a little old lady, not as much as when I was a kid, but I still see it.
[01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:20.132]  I know a lot of you are good.
[01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:23.454]  Frankly, state police, others, I probably get pulled over twice a year.
[01:14:24.474 --> 01:14:29.557]  I forget and go off cruise control because some car pulls in front of me and I've got to slow down and then I forget to put it on.
[01:14:29.577 --> 01:14:30.938]  I have bad luck.
[01:14:30.998 --> 01:14:34.099]  I'm usually going seven, eight miles over the speed limit and they get me and they go,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:43.765]  I've had other state police tell me, oh yeah, I talked to my buddy who pulled you over in Temple and you were so nice, he thought you'd be mean, he just let you go.
[01:14:43.785 --> 01:14:45.026]  I am nice!
[01:14:45.667 --> 01:14:47.248]  I don't have anything against you!
[01:14:47.888 --> 01:14:50.450]  In fact, I'll tell you a story I don't think I've ever told before.
[01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:55.213]  When I was 19 years old, going to college, I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[01:14:55.753 --> 01:14:58.075]  Okay, I had this instinctive need to protect people.
[01:14:58.435 --> 01:15:01.217]  I don't like bullies, beat up my fair share of them growing up.
[01:15:02.032 --> 01:15:02.872]  I didn't know what to be.
[01:15:02.892 --> 01:15:06.593]  I wasn't that good at the studies.
[01:15:06.873 --> 01:15:11.795]  Some classes I had a 95 and others I was making a C-.
[01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:17.276]  And so I said to my dad, I said, Dad, maybe I should become a police officer.
[01:15:17.756 --> 01:15:18.576]  And he said, you know what?
[01:15:18.636 --> 01:15:21.917]  I got a good friend who is about to graduate.
[01:15:21.957 --> 01:15:26.158]  He was like the head federal marshal for a whole region.
[01:15:26.918 --> 01:15:28.819]  And he set up a meeting a week later with that guy.
[01:15:29.562 --> 01:15:32.443]  And he walked right in, and guess what he told me?
[01:15:32.483 --> 01:15:35.185]  I'll tell you what he told me when we get back.
[01:15:35.825 --> 01:15:36.185]  Okay?
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:38.366]  Stay with us.
[01:15:38.386 --> 01:15:41.188]  And I'll tell you the actual story of what developed as well.
[01:15:41.368 --> 01:15:41.868]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:56.523]  The Japanese have used magnetic therapy for thousands of years, and it's more popular today than ever before.

[01:20:22.289 --> 01:20:26.992]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:32.155]  Alright, I want to get into some more news and finish up with all your great phone calls here.
[01:20:32.175 --> 01:20:35.477]  We've only got about 25 minutes left here on the Sunday edition.
[01:20:37.011 --> 01:20:46.379]  But to make a long story short here, Americans have gone from the most intelligent, most informed, wealthiest people to really the most ignorant.
[01:20:46.419 --> 01:21:04.195]  I mean, folks in Germany and Russia and Mexico, they know police are corrupt, they know common sense, but here we believe our own propaganda and all the media just constantly worshipping police, when in reality, they have the highest instances of drug abuse, alcoholism,
[01:21:05.399 --> 01:21:06.900]  On average, more than double.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.420]  And that's when they get caught.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.041]  The system protects them of being involved in crimes.
[01:21:11.981 --> 01:21:18.902]  I mean, this is the group of civil servants that statistically is totally untrustworthy.
[01:21:19.143 --> 01:21:20.703]  But then everybody else is a criminal.
[01:21:20.783 --> 01:21:22.243]  None of us can be trusted.
[01:21:22.803 --> 01:21:27.364]  All of the American people are bad and have to lose our freedoms.
[01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:33.586]  But illegal aliens and police and people in government, they're first class citizens and they've got all their rights.
[01:21:34.272 --> 01:22:02.912]  I frankly am tired of it, but just to tell you the story, and to do it as briefly as possible, you've heard me on air many times at Men on Speed, and there are police out there listening over the years who pulled me over, and if I've been speeding I don't argue about it, but I'm driving along, and I've got my cruise control set on, it might have been 71, it's just right above 70, and yeah, nighttime 65, and I'm sitting there in the fast lane, there's no cars around me, and I'm just driving along,
[01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:06.997]  And all of a sudden there's this wide median.
[01:22:07.377 --> 01:22:12.578]  And normally the state police will sit off behind some trees or where it's narrow in a spot parked.
[01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:13.338]  No, no, no.
[01:22:13.378 --> 01:22:17.519]  This car, it appeared, was driving on the other side of the highway.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.220]  It's cherries come on.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:23.561]  It comes just accelerating through some type of gully.
[01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:27.302]  Fish tailing wildly with it's cherries on them.
[01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:28.842]  My wife says, are they coming after us?
[01:22:28.862 --> 01:22:29.542]  And I said, oh no.
[01:22:29.883 --> 01:22:31.523]  Somebody drove off with gas or
[01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:32.211]  There's
[01:22:51.047 --> 01:22:52.609]  Again, it's hard to get the name.
[01:22:52.649 --> 01:22:58.196]  It's G-A-L-V-O-N or V-A-N, Galvan or Galwan.
[01:22:58.237 --> 01:23:02.682]  I mean, she wrote it where you can't even hardly read it, but we do have the name tag, but that, too, is a little bit blurry.
[01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:05.286]  ID number 9883.
[01:23:05.326 --> 01:23:06.828]  I'm talking about a god here on Earth.
[01:23:07.228 --> 01:23:11.510]  Again, they've got to put cameras up and watch us and announce all our names, but don't put a camera on them.
[01:23:11.571 --> 01:23:12.631]  Don't announce who they are.
[01:23:13.111 --> 01:23:15.213]  This is blasphemy here, folks.
[01:23:15.493 --> 01:23:17.334]  We've got to learn to worship our Praetorian Guard.
[01:23:17.694 --> 01:23:29.060]  I was in Region 3, District 13, Area 4, G-A-L-W-A-N, Galvin, and I asked her name.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.222]  She said you can get it off the ticket, but you can't really read it on here.
[01:23:32.242 --> 01:23:34.763]  We're trying to piece it together with what's on her shirt.
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:47.943]  And I'm supposed to go visit with Judge Biden, so not only did she give me 77 miles an hour when I wasn't, then she walks up and I go, yes, good evening.
[01:23:49.464 --> 01:23:50.584]  License and insurance.
[01:23:50.864 --> 01:23:54.865]  And then there's another one looking constantly, as they do, with the spotlight.
[01:23:54.885 --> 01:23:57.206]  Didn't happen 20, 30 years ago, but now it's a new America.
[01:23:57.926 --> 01:24:00.207]  Again, got to leave the borders open, have illegals running around.
[01:24:00.598 --> 01:24:06.064]  Getting bank accounts and housing loans with no ID, but you, you've got to be watched real careful.
[01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:09.147]  And literally, banditos are driving by at 90 miles an hour.
[01:24:10.248 --> 01:24:18.056]  As all this is happening, and there I am sitting there, and my wife's digging around, takes her about 20 seconds, and she goes, where is it?
[01:24:18.377 --> 01:24:19.118]  Where's your insurance?
[01:24:19.138 --> 01:24:20.299]  Well, I've got to find it.
[01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:22.261]  You know, whose apartment isn't full of papers.
[01:24:22.992 --> 01:24:25.493]  And then she comes back, and they just keep looking.
[01:24:25.773 --> 01:24:30.455]  And literally, folks, it's like when a pit bull runs up to your child, it's growling.
[01:24:30.475 --> 01:24:31.876]  I mean, she was literally growling.
[01:24:32.336 --> 01:24:35.157]  I've got this woman, wild-eyed, okay?
[01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:38.978]  Wild-eyed at my window, and I'm thinking, did we fit a description or something?
[01:24:39.559 --> 01:24:42.880]  And she's sitting there with these flashlights, just looking at my children, who are both asleep.
[01:24:43.496 --> 01:24:43.796]  Okay.
[01:24:44.257 --> 01:24:45.337]  Little, you know, small children.
[01:24:45.697 --> 01:24:49.480]  And they're both, you know, the most expensive, best seats.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.921]  My wife doesn't even trust me to put them in.
[01:24:51.961 --> 01:24:55.924]  Goes to the fire department, and she says, Who installed these car seats?
[01:24:56.604 --> 01:24:58.345]  And I said, Well, my professionals did.
[01:24:58.365 --> 01:25:00.006]  And she goes, Oh!
[01:25:00.046 --> 01:25:00.746]  She starts interrogating.
[01:25:00.766 --> 01:25:02.568]  What do you mean, professionals installed it?
[01:25:02.768 --> 01:25:03.008]  Who?
[01:25:03.928 --> 01:25:06.652]  And I said, well, I said, who was it, the dealer out here?
[01:25:06.672 --> 01:25:07.313]  Was it the fireman?
[01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:09.555]  She said, oh yeah, somebody else installed them.
[01:25:09.595 --> 01:25:10.917]  And I started looking back.
[01:25:10.937 --> 01:25:11.738]  My kids were asleep.
[01:25:11.758 --> 01:25:14.582]  They're both in the, you know, the crash harnesses.
[01:25:15.603 --> 01:25:22.172]  And I'm sitting there and I look back at her and I, because every once in a while my daughter will try to wiggle out and slip out of one.
[01:25:22.509 --> 01:25:25.170]  And I look at her, and I said, you just asked me, and I just told you.
[01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:31.872]  Now, see, up until the point, and this went on for about five minutes, her griping at us, she wasn't saying anything was wrong, and then she just kept heavy breathing.
[01:25:31.972 --> 01:25:35.133]  I mean, it was like a, my wife said, it was like a wolf was at our window.
[01:25:35.413 --> 01:25:38.654]  Heavy breathing, standing there with a flashlight going, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[01:25:38.874 --> 01:25:51.398]  Sitting there, off and on, baring her teeth, looking at my kids, and then my instincts are just, I mean, if a dog would have done it, a crazy homeless person would have done it, but no, this is somebody in a uniform, with a gun, and now the other one's gone back, and is just standing back there,
[01:25:52.188 --> 01:26:01.214]  And she goes back, and I can hear him saying, no, no, and they're sitting there having a conversation, and she comes back, and she goes, and I'm just going, what's going on with these car seats?
[01:26:01.254 --> 01:26:21.467]  And I said, listen, you're basically being rude to us, you drove recklessly coming across the median there, and I said, I want your name, and I want your badge number, and she said, no, you can get it off the ticket, and then she came back and gave me a ticket, and again, big spectacular story, it's not spectacular, it's that
[01:26:22.128 --> 01:26:24.130]  I've been pulled over by state police and they're nice.
[01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:25.971]  Or they're just like a robot.
[01:26:26.732 --> 01:26:28.193]  That's fine with me, okay?
[01:26:28.233 --> 01:26:32.436]  And I'm usually quote, so nice, I've been told by state police, I'm letting you go.
[01:26:34.198 --> 01:26:35.899]  This was hyperventilating.
[01:26:35.979 --> 01:26:46.507]  This was... You know, I mean, if I saw this... If I saw this woman in plain clothes on a street corner, I would think that she was some type of crazed homeless person.
[01:26:47.588 --> 01:26:48.429]  You know, literally
[01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:54.236]  And I'm sorry that maybe daddy wasn't nice to you.
[01:26:54.396 --> 01:26:55.777]  I'm not your daddy, lady.
[01:26:56.898 --> 01:26:57.779]  This is psychology.
[01:26:57.819 --> 01:26:58.940]  This is why a lot of them get into it.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.323]  I'm sorry that things in your life weren't perfect.
[01:27:02.563 --> 01:27:04.064]  I'm sorry you're broke.
[01:27:04.084 --> 01:27:05.526]  I'm just speculating here.
[01:27:05.926 --> 01:27:07.027]  I'm sorry that
[01:27:07.893 --> 01:27:14.958]  Your neighbor was rude to you, or you got out of the wrong side of the bed one morning, but you're not God!
[01:27:15.118 --> 01:27:19.501]  I pray to Jesus every night, and I'm never going to pray to you!
[01:27:20.582 --> 01:27:26.746]  And, you know, the point here is that she was hyped up
[01:27:28.456 --> 01:27:34.002]  Hopped up on power, whatever, literally breathing hard, bugging your eyes out at us, aggressively.
[01:27:34.042 --> 01:27:38.527]  I mean, if I came up to you, looking at you the way she was looking at me, you'd probably put your fist up.
[01:27:38.547 --> 01:27:39.849]  You know, it's body language.
[01:27:39.869 --> 01:27:40.830]  That's the thing she was saying.
[01:27:41.525 --> 01:27:44.526]  And she didn't say... It was just crazy!
[01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:45.647]  It was crazy!
[01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.848]  And I don't know how many black SUVs are out there.
[01:27:47.868 --> 01:27:52.970]  I was later going, well maybe we put a description or something, but it seemed like the other one didn't want any part in it.
[01:27:53.290 --> 01:28:00.593]  But just having this woman breathing hard, and I would look back and she was staring at my kids, and I mean, she looked like she was out of her gourd!
[01:28:01.453 --> 01:28:02.374]  I mean, and I'm sorry!
[01:28:02.454 --> 01:28:03.714]  I can't worship you!
[01:28:03.734 --> 01:28:08.196]  I know statistically you're involved in more crime than the general public!
[01:28:08.806 --> 01:28:09.906]  I know statistically.
[01:28:10.127 --> 01:28:12.407]  I grew up with Sheriff Jack McWhorter.
[01:28:12.447 --> 01:28:16.109]  The Sheriff was the cocaine and marijuana dealer, and he went to prison for it.
[01:28:16.549 --> 01:28:17.689]  I know criminology.
[01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:19.790]  So I can't get down and lick your boots.
[01:28:20.551 --> 01:28:23.212]  I know they told you we're all criminals, so none of us can be trusted.
[01:28:23.412 --> 01:28:25.753]  No, statistically, you can't be trusted.
[01:28:25.913 --> 01:28:37.397]  You're either mentally, uh, about police in general, unstable and on a power trip, or you're a good cop in with a bunch of bad ones who can't do anything, and just goes along with it, which makes you a bad cop.
[01:28:38.178 --> 01:28:39.459]  Or, you're a criminal!
[01:28:40.059 --> 01:28:45.723]  And that's history, and that's the facts, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what nobody has the will and the nerve to say.
[01:28:46.444 --> 01:28:47.564]  What happened to Americans?
[01:28:47.745 --> 01:28:48.805]  Who are we as a people?
[01:28:48.845 --> 01:29:07.558]  But to finish my story from earlier... So, I'm 19, and I'm handsome, athletic, smart, and I'm thinking, well, I want to go into the military, I want to go be a school teacher, do I want to be a police officer, do I want to... I don't think I'm smart enough to do an engineering degree, so I was trying to look at the, you know,
[01:29:08.433 --> 01:29:10.094]  Policing, like a lot of people just look at it.
[01:29:10.414 --> 01:29:11.295]  My dad was real smart.
[01:29:11.375 --> 01:29:13.316]  He said, let me talk, let me have you talk to somebody.
[01:29:13.356 --> 01:29:14.257]  He's told me stories about it.
[01:29:14.277 --> 01:29:21.022]  So he has this long time patient who is, you know, this super high level, which is as high as it gets in a region.
[01:29:21.582 --> 01:29:22.743]  It was for several states.
[01:29:24.284 --> 01:29:24.504]  U.S.
[01:29:24.544 --> 01:29:24.884]  Marshal.
[01:29:25.605 --> 01:29:26.425]  I'm out of time again.
[01:29:27.186 --> 01:29:31.128]  And I'll tell, I promise I'm not doing this on purpose.
[01:29:31.489 --> 01:29:34.971]  I'll tell the other side and we'll go to Lucas, Richard, Juan, Emily.
[01:29:36.666 --> 01:29:38.453]  Oh, I'm just having it out of control today.
[01:29:39.236 --> 01:29:40.380]  But I'll finish the story on the other side.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:40.721]  Stay with me.
[01:29:51.997 --> 01:29:52.537]  Hey, Emily!
[01:29:52.817 --> 01:29:53.718]  Wow, you look great!
[01:29:54.078 --> 01:29:54.878]  I feel great!
[01:29:55.118 --> 01:29:57.059]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:57.720]  Really?
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.360]  What is it?
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:58.960]  How does it work?
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:05.543]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:30:05.663 --> 01:30:07.924]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:30:08.105 --> 01:30:13.227]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:30:13.547 --> 01:30:14.008]  That's it?
[01:30:14.248 --> 01:30:15.849]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:30:16.049 --> 01:30:16.750]  It is easy.
[01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:23.596]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:25.217]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:30:25.418 --> 01:30:26.198]  That's amazing!
[01:30:26.519 --> 01:30:31.863]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:30:32.123 --> 01:30:32.444]  Wow!

[01:30:56.206 --> 01:31:00.189]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.

[01:31:51.953 --> 01:31:57.977]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:57.997 --> 01:32:00.179]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.650]  I think so.
[01:32:20.418 --> 01:32:20.878]  We're good to go.
[01:32:47.391 --> 01:32:54.373]  This country is filled with millionaires living the good life.
[01:32:54.573 --> 01:32:55.173]  And you know what?
[01:32:55.353 --> 01:32:57.174]  Those millionaires are just like you.
[01:32:57.194 --> 01:32:58.794]  Hi, this is Dolph DeRoos.
[01:32:59.054 --> 01:33:03.715]  And I should know, without a single penny, I bought my first property at the age of only 17.
[01:33:04.035 --> 01:33:07.276]  Since then, I've become a real estate millionaire living the good life.
[01:33:07.556 --> 01:33:11.697]  I've created a proven system to real estate buying that can make anyone a millionaire.
[01:33:11.957 --> 01:33:17.478]  Now I want to share my secrets with as many people as possible, so I've put together a powerful tape giving you the basics.

[01:33:28.781 --> 01:33:30.221]  It's absolutely true.
[01:33:30.541 --> 01:33:34.062]  Even if you don't own a home, you still have what it takes to become rich.
[01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:35.023]  Very rich.
[01:33:35.203 --> 01:33:36.663]  And my system will prove it to you.

[01:33:41.646 --> 01:33:41.706]  1-800-600-1738.
[01:33:41.726 --> 01:33:41.786]  It?
[01:33:41.806 --> 01:33:44.828]  Thank you for listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:34:04.032 --> 01:34:05.594]  Agree or disagree?
[01:34:06.695 --> 01:34:10.818]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:15.942]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:34:17.303 --> 01:34:20.886]  The United States was different and was loved because we didn't have a police state.
[01:34:20.967 --> 01:34:22.067]  Everywhere else does!
[01:34:22.928 --> 01:34:24.630]  And it allows elites to be very corrupt.
[01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:25.791]  You're being used, police.
[01:34:26.851 --> 01:34:29.033]  The system is almost terminal right now.
[01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:31.035]  And I didn't know this when I was
[01:34:32.115 --> 01:34:33.016]  18, 19 years old.
[01:34:33.216 --> 01:34:37.640]  And so here's this big six foot four, you know, handsome older gentleman about to retire.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:38.641]  He was just about to retire.
[01:34:38.661 --> 01:34:40.442]  And he called me in my dad's office.
[01:34:41.803 --> 01:34:43.505]  My dad was his physician.
[01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:46.207]  And my dad set this meeting up and he came in to talk to me.
[01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:48.449]  And I'm sitting there and he goes, well, why do you want to be a police officer?
[01:34:48.489 --> 01:34:49.790]  I said, well, I've never liked bullies.
[01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.812]  And, you know, I like sports and stuff.
[01:34:51.872 --> 01:34:53.433]  And I just think it'd be good to help people.
[01:34:53.493 --> 01:34:55.935]  And my dad always stops to help people change tires.
[01:34:55.975 --> 01:34:57.216]  It was almost annoying when I was a kid.
[01:34:57.236 --> 01:34:58.577]  And I like to help people.
[01:34:58.637 --> 01:34:59.498]  And I mean, I really do.
[01:35:00.416 --> 01:35:01.556]  And, you know, there's that instinct.
[01:35:01.596 --> 01:35:02.797]  Most cops get into it for that.
[01:35:02.817 --> 01:35:05.038]  I'm not saying you're all bad, but the system's bad.
[01:35:05.578 --> 01:35:06.638]  He goes, let me just tell you something.
[01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:10.680]  He said, he goes, well, let me ask you a question.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:17.002]  He goes, police, especially at the federal level, are a lot like criminals today.
[01:35:17.562 --> 01:35:20.383]  Would you be willing, and I didn't know later, this is an old cop question,
[01:35:20.905 --> 01:35:25.629]  Back in the day, when they were trying to test youngsters, because the East is so corrupt, things would just break down.
[01:35:25.649 --> 01:35:27.631]  I mean, literally working for the Mafia.
[01:35:27.851 --> 01:35:30.293]  That new film, The Deceased, is very accurate.
[01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:35.597]  That's based on a true story, where the FBI was running murder for hire on the East Coast, okay?
[01:35:36.238 --> 01:35:44.324]  And he said to me, and this is a high-level federal marshal, he said, Alex, 20, 30 years ago, I might have said something different, but he said, listen, it's criminals now.
[01:35:44.565 --> 01:35:47.987]  He goes, the good guys are few and far between.
[01:35:48.007 --> 01:35:49.849]  He goes, don't get into law enforcement.
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:51.280]  And he said, don't do it.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.841]  And he goes, I'm friends with your father.
[01:35:52.921 --> 01:35:53.602]  I know you.
[01:35:53.802 --> 01:35:55.102]  I can tell you're a good young man.
[01:35:55.402 --> 01:35:56.523]  He goes, pick something else.
[01:35:57.604 --> 01:36:01.025]  Okay, now, I mean, I even knew the sheriff where I grew up was a dope dealer.
[01:36:01.405 --> 01:36:03.667]  But I guess I hadn't put total two and two together yet.
[01:36:03.887 --> 01:36:06.788]  So my only point is, you don't give us a benefit of the doubt.
[01:36:07.008 --> 01:36:10.490]  You don't treat me and my wife and my family with respect.
[01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:12.391]  I'm not going to give you any respect!
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:23.828]  And you're lucky that other state police officer kept you for making a big mistake, because I'd let you do whatever you were going to do, but I would sue you and expose you until hell freezes over!
[01:36:25.529 --> 01:36:30.133]  And more people need... you know, I don't have time to go down there and fight this ticket, but I think I need to.
[01:36:30.153 --> 01:36:32.555]  I think I'm going to take cameras, make a big issue out of it.
[01:36:33.155 --> 01:36:36.478]  I'm going to be there with cameras when she comes in to give her testimony.
[01:36:36.558 --> 01:36:37.399]  I'm going to...
[01:36:38.521 --> 01:36:39.262]  But I've got to weigh it.
[01:36:39.282 --> 01:36:40.522]  I've got so many other things I need to do.
[01:36:40.722 --> 01:36:45.085]  And listen, Trey, really nice young man, runs the show, about to graduate from UT this year.
[01:36:46.325 --> 01:36:47.186]  High in his class.
[01:36:47.546 --> 01:36:48.126]  Great guy.
[01:36:48.166 --> 01:36:49.767]  I've got him doing some work for me on the side.
[01:36:50.407 --> 01:36:51.428]  He never told me this story.
[01:36:51.508 --> 01:36:55.450]  He just popped up with his story because they now have roving SWAT teams in Austin.
[01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:56.710]  I said, well, where did this happen?
[01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:59.111]  He said, Austin, tell the story and I'm going to take some final calls.
[01:36:59.512 --> 01:37:00.552]  I was just right in front of St.
[01:37:00.592 --> 01:37:02.493]  Edward's University doing about maybe 42 and a 35.
[01:37:04.594 --> 01:37:06.775]  They pulled me over and I just had a smile on my face.
[01:37:06.855 --> 01:37:11.876]  Just wanted to be, you know, just wanted to get out of there.
[01:37:12.096 --> 01:37:15.077]  I had them in my face telling me, oh, you think this is so funny?
[01:37:15.137 --> 01:37:19.098]  I bet you think it was funny if we pulled you out of this car and threw you on the ground.
[01:37:19.218 --> 01:37:20.098]  Smiling's bad!
[01:37:20.178 --> 01:37:20.958]  Frowning's bad!
[01:37:21.138 --> 01:37:21.658]  Exactly.
[01:37:22.398 --> 01:37:23.519]  Because these are mental patients.
[01:37:23.939 --> 01:37:25.679]  And it was just all out from there.
[01:37:25.719 --> 01:37:26.499]  There were four of them.
[01:37:26.519 --> 01:37:28.420]  But let me guess, the commander was a woman.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.820]  And I'm not, listen, I don't know what it is about women cops.
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:32.821]  I've never had problems in my life with cops.
[01:37:33.201 --> 01:37:34.081]  But with women cops.
[01:37:34.442 --> 01:37:36.983]  I had four guys assault me.
[01:37:37.343 --> 01:37:38.963]  This was political, telling me to shove about 9-11.
[01:37:39.584 --> 01:37:40.664]  This was in 1998.
[01:37:41.244 --> 01:37:46.947]  And these two male cops show up real nice, and a woman shows up, starts threatening to arrest me as blood's pouring out of my face.
[01:37:47.087 --> 01:37:52.989]  It was three males in the group, and all the males were big, you know, swole up, old, you know, they looked like ex-football players.
[01:37:53.069 --> 01:37:54.450]  But they were following the Queen Bee?
[01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:56.650]  Oh, they let the woman do the talking.
[01:37:56.710 --> 01:38:00.172]  I mean, she was the one telling me that she wanted to yank me out of the car.
[01:38:00.772 --> 01:38:05.258]  When they found out I worked in radio, I said, well, I'm just on my way to work, you know, I'm just trying to catch up.
[01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:11.646]  They started just telling me, oh, I suppose you're just going to tell about how horrible the police department is.
[01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:12.868]  But you never did, but now you are.
[01:38:12.888 --> 01:38:16.112]  Well, I wasn't going to, you know what I mean, but I just got harassed.
[01:38:16.152 --> 01:38:16.973]  I mean, I had my mouth shut.
[01:38:16.993 --> 01:38:18.475]  You shouldn't talk about your God that way.
[01:38:19.105 --> 01:38:23.328]  I had my mouth shut the entire time, and this was all coming from me and not from them, you know.
[01:38:23.448 --> 01:38:27.091]  What they do is they randomly run around looking for drugs, and by the way, I'm so sick of it.
[01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:37.698]  I've interviewed, what, five or six former top CIA people, I've interviewed DEA, FBI, all on record, who were there unloading and shipping the cocaine back and forth between these countries.
[01:38:38.278 --> 01:38:43.042]  The government ships in the majority of the narcotics, and any cartel they bust wasn't paying its cut.
[01:38:43.262 --> 01:38:47.966]  They ship it in, so they have an excuse to grade our houses instead of a police state.
[01:38:48.146 --> 01:38:49.707]  And I don't use your filthy drugs!
[01:38:49.727 --> 01:38:51.488]  In fact, young people NEVER use them!
[01:38:51.849 --> 01:38:54.631]  Don't drink, because that's their excuse to get you in their system there.
[01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:58.334]  Don't smoke their cigarettes, because then they want to charge you for taxes.
[01:38:59.154 --> 01:39:03.117]  MTV and the culture tells you drugs are cool, so you'll go and rebel and use them.
[01:39:03.317 --> 01:39:04.318]  Don't use them!
[01:39:04.658 --> 01:39:07.020]  Don't let these people get you in their clutches!
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:07.881]  Never touch them!
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.801]  Oh, it makes me sick!
[01:39:10.521 --> 01:39:15.745]  I guess the cops in Dallas were good framing all those hundreds of people throwing bags of chalk in their car just randomly.
[01:39:16.006 --> 01:39:17.727]  You know, it starts out framing drug dealers.
[01:39:17.747 --> 01:39:18.948]  Well, they're bad, so we framed them.
[01:39:19.188 --> 01:39:20.149]  Next, it's families.
[01:39:21.029 --> 01:39:22.911]  And then the cops end up driving their cars.
[01:39:24.572 --> 01:39:25.233]  Anything else, Craig?
[01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:29.336]  No, I mean, it was just a horrifying experience.
[01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:35.981]  I mean, I just, you know, I just... I don't even know what to do next time I get pulled over just because I don't know what kind of attitude I'm going to be met with, you know?
[01:39:38.053 --> 01:39:38.513]  I don't know.
[01:39:38.533 --> 01:39:40.875]  I haven't gotten a ticket since.
[01:39:40.995 --> 01:39:46.720]  I've got to tell you, the state police have always been the most professional at events and protests, and I'm friends with the Capitol Police.
[01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:49.403]  Genuinely, they know all about the show and tell me about it.
[01:39:50.624 --> 01:39:52.025]  Frankly, it's probably not fair.
[01:39:52.305 --> 01:39:56.930]  I had a really bad wreck out in Fredericksburg, and it was like they had the red carpet for me.
[01:39:58.111 --> 01:40:00.313]  That is not the case with women cops.
[01:40:03.777 --> 01:40:06.118]  You know, it's like saying pit bulls bite people.
[01:40:06.399 --> 01:40:07.979]  Oh, you're being prejudiced against pit bulls.
[01:40:07.999 --> 01:40:09.240]  I've heard pit bull owners say that.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.742]  Well, I mean, it's always pit bulls attacking kids.
[01:40:12.022 --> 01:40:14.003]  Well, it's always these crazy women cops.
[01:40:14.643 --> 01:40:20.567]  I mean, they're crazy to me, sitting there, bugging their eyes out and baring their teeth and acting all weird to my kids.
[01:40:20.607 --> 01:40:21.227]  I mean, you know.
[01:40:21.527 --> 01:40:22.768]  I wanted to treat you with respect.
[01:40:22.828 --> 01:40:29.812]  I respect women in jobs like that, you know, who have a bad, you know, with a bad... But see, what type of woman wants to go be especially a SWAT cop?
[01:40:30.132 --> 01:40:31.473]  One that's got something to prove.
[01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:33.771]  One that's got something to prove.
[01:40:33.991 --> 01:40:35.292]  Wants to shove men around.
[01:40:35.972 --> 01:40:37.393]  Daddy wasn't nice to her.
[01:40:38.414 --> 01:40:39.114]  You got a chance.
[01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:40.395]  Yeah, it's sick.
[01:40:40.435 --> 01:40:41.376]  Let's take a few final calls.
[01:40:41.416 --> 01:40:42.537]  I apologize to the callers.
[01:40:42.837 --> 01:40:44.378]  Got to a lot of you today, but not as many as I should.
[01:40:44.758 --> 01:40:47.820]  Lucas, make it quick, Commander, from Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.221]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:54.064]  I want to thank you for all your hard work and for having the hoo-hahs to stand up like nobody else does, actually.
[01:40:54.344 --> 01:40:55.825]  But I had a quick statement I wanted to make.
[01:40:56.185 --> 01:41:00.028]  I want to say friends, brothers, people of all genders, colors, and walks of life,
[01:41:00.373 --> 01:41:01.513]  This is a call to action.
[01:41:01.773 --> 01:41:05.074]  A call for everyone who knows the real truth about 9-11 to come forth.
[01:41:05.494 --> 01:41:08.235]  Come forth and be heard in a singular deafening voice.
[01:41:08.675 --> 01:41:11.495]  Band together with me to crush the lies and expose the truth.
[01:41:11.855 --> 01:41:16.056]  It's time we stop whispering to each other about the truth and start waking up.
[01:41:16.076 --> 01:41:17.736]  9-11's an inside job, baby!
[01:41:17.877 --> 01:41:20.317]  Go watch Terry Gorman for free at Google Video!
[01:41:20.837 --> 01:41:28.919]  I implore you, if you have even the smallest shred of decency as an American, you will look for the statement I put out on January 1st on 911blogger.com.
[01:41:30.475 --> 01:41:34.098]  Well, I will issue instructions on how to get involved in this amazing idea.
[01:41:34.518 --> 01:41:35.359]  My name is Lucas.
[01:41:35.479 --> 01:41:38.962]  Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and meet me at 911blogger.com.
[01:41:39.102 --> 01:41:41.925]  Alright, lavish plug for yourself, but it is a great website.
[01:41:41.945 --> 01:41:45.508]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, we routinely link to that fine site.
[01:41:45.548 --> 01:41:47.770]  Let's talk to Richard.
[01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:48.731]  Welcome, sir.
[01:41:48.831 --> 01:41:50.212]  You're calling from Phoenix.
[01:41:50.892 --> 01:41:51.473]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:51.613 --> 01:41:51.993]  Hello.
[01:41:52.154 --> 01:41:53.294]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:41:53.975 --> 01:41:57.138]  And I just want to let you know all my family and friends are getting terrorist stormed.
[01:41:58.093 --> 01:42:00.154]  I ordered them last week and they're on the way.
[01:42:00.374 --> 01:42:05.777]  Yes, sir, and it spent three weeks in the top 100 going as high as number eight on Amazon.com.
[01:42:05.937 --> 01:42:07.758]  Yeah, maybe we can get that up to number one, huh?
[01:42:08.338 --> 01:42:08.779]  Who knows?
[01:42:08.859 --> 01:42:10.860]  It goes back and forth like a pogo stick.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:11.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:19.044]  Hey, I have a question for you, and I don't know a lot about this, but I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Brandon Corey story.
[01:42:20.044 --> 01:42:23.246]  I guess Brandon Corey was reporting on Dick Cheney and
[01:42:24.352 --> 01:42:31.074]  He's vanished and I think it's reported something to do... Yeah, I've seen the story and I can't confirm it.
[01:42:31.114 --> 01:42:33.394]  Again, I'm going to have to do more research on that.
[01:42:34.074 --> 01:42:35.735]  It's David Icke type stuff.
[01:42:36.735 --> 01:42:37.975]  Let's talk to Jared.
[01:42:38.095 --> 01:42:39.416]  Jared, welcome.
[01:42:39.436 --> 01:42:43.216]  I guess you're calling into KLBJ here in Austin.
[01:42:43.236 --> 01:42:43.857]  Go ahead, Jared.
[01:42:44.237 --> 01:42:46.057]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:46.557 --> 01:42:49.718]  I just want to get to the point real quick because I don't have a lot of time.
[01:42:50.734 --> 01:42:53.196]  People have seemed to have forgotten about Sepico.
[01:42:53.676 --> 01:42:54.777]  He was a real person.
[01:42:54.817 --> 01:42:56.138]  You know, that movie... No, no, no, no.
[01:42:56.218 --> 01:42:58.059]  Cops that are against drug dealing are evil.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.002]  They need to learn to enjoy the drug cash and roll in it.
[01:43:02.262 --> 01:43:12.590]  But again, the average American doesn't even know the... I mean, listen, beat cops are good, by and large, unless they're nutcases, or weird, or having a bad day, or think you're somebody else other than you are.
[01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:15.392]  But when you get up in high levels, folks, most of them are gangsters.
[01:43:15.432 --> 01:43:15.952]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:16.508 --> 01:43:16.748]  Right.
[01:43:17.029 --> 01:43:17.789]  Oh no, it's okay.
[01:43:18.009 --> 01:43:22.393]  I'm from Houston originally, and cops are a lot more corrupt overall in Houston.
[01:43:22.453 --> 01:43:23.153]  Oh yeah, baby.
[01:43:23.354 --> 01:43:23.654]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:24.034 --> 01:43:25.035]  It's like most big cities.
[01:43:25.155 --> 01:43:27.837]  And I just want to tell people that Seperco was based on a real story.
[01:43:27.877 --> 01:43:30.199]  It wasn't a movie based on fiction.
[01:43:30.239 --> 01:43:32.181]  It was based on real life.
[01:43:32.401 --> 01:43:34.182]  They kill cops all the time.
[01:43:34.222 --> 01:43:36.244]  Cops kill cops all the time.
[01:43:36.805 --> 01:43:37.305]  That's right.
[01:43:37.405 --> 01:43:41.608]  So people have to realize, police corruption is real, no matter if they experience it or not.
[01:43:42.577 --> 01:43:44.059]  They don't get this stuff out of fiction.
[01:43:44.099 --> 01:43:46.201]  The best stuff, you know, comes from real life.
[01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:47.442]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:43:47.482 --> 01:43:52.167]  So people need to realize and keep their minds open that police corruption is very real, like government corruption is.
[01:43:52.567 --> 01:43:53.228]  Absolutely!
[01:43:53.288 --> 01:43:57.972]  Listen, the Mafia, that's a true story by the way, but they changed the names so they wouldn't get sued.
[01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:02.857]  Because I read it in the mainstream newspapers 6, 7, 8 years ago when it first started breaking in Boston.
[01:44:03.178 --> 01:44:05.400]  You know, the new film with Jack Nicholson in it.
[01:44:06.298 --> 01:44:08.139]  And Matt Damon, excellent film.
[01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:13.261]  That's a true story where the mafia gets their people into the highest levels of the detectives.
[01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:19.003]  I mean, yeah, the film's ain't departed.
[01:44:19.023 --> 01:44:23.024]  I was just thinking about whether I should tell the stories when I work for a carpet cleaning company.
[01:44:23.044 --> 01:44:26.245]  And you're like, cops' houses are like two million dollar houses?
[01:44:26.926 --> 01:44:29.666]  I mean, come on, man.
[01:44:29.887 --> 01:44:30.887]  That's right here in Austin.
[01:44:31.385 --> 01:44:32.006]  God bless you.
[01:44:32.026 --> 01:44:32.828]  See you next week.
[01:44:33.188 --> 01:44:34.470]  I've broken another taboo.
[01:44:34.531 --> 01:44:36.374]  I've talked about our God.
[01:44:36.514 --> 01:44:37.416]  I've thrown down an idol.
[01:44:37.856 --> 01:44:39.159]  No king but King Jesus!
[01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:39.700]  God bless ya!
[01:44:41.969 --> 01:44:46.211]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.
