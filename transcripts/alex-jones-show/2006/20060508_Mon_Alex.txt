[00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:06.067]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:07.808]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:09.569]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.090]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.712]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:17.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:21.658]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:35.207]  Yeah.
[00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.994]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:41.714 --> 00:00:45.916]  It's Monday, already the eighth day of May 2006.
[00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:51.239]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.279 --> 00:01:04.064]  We have a great guest lined up for you that I'll tell you about later in this hour concerning September 11th and some new developments in the fight to expose what really happened almost five years ago.
[00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:04.905]  That's right, the
[00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:11.391]  Fifth anniversary is just about four months away.
[00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.535]  Four months and three days away.
[00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:18.014]  Iran's leader writes to President Bush.
[00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.094]  We'll tell you what he had to say.
[00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:24.235]  And we'll get into the whole General Michael V. Hayden controversy.
[00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:44.279]  Most Americans have never heard of the head of the National Security Agency, who stepped down late last year and became number two over the 16 intelligence agencies run by John Negroponte, the great death squad Fajah, the great death squad Vader, the father of the death squads.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.122]  And why has Porter Goss stood down?
[00:01:48.162 --> 00:02:08.252]  Well, it's connected to the Watergate Hotel, and some individuals under investigation and under indictment, and some who pled guilty, like Duke Cunningham, the congressman who admittedly stole $800 million for only a payment of $2.4 million, at these parties of the poker, the fine cigars, and the fine hookers.
[00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:16.083]  And so, that has now come out in the mainstream news concerning the involvement of Porter Goss.
[00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:21.667]  Now, we don't know if he was involved with the hookers, but we know he was at the parties where the payoffs were flowing.
[00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:25.369]  And so, in comes Michael V. Hayden.
[00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.412]  What a piece of work this gentleman is.
[00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:35.136]  And remember, a few months ago, we played the clip where he confronts the reporter and says, no, there's nothing about
[00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:37.275]  Probable cause in the Fourth Amendment?
[00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:38.275]  No, no, no.
[00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:43.498]  Believe me, if there's one thing I know, it's the Fourth Amendment, and you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:49.161]  So we'll play that clip again and get back into this multi-layered controversy.
[00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.842]  I don't normally just get into mainstream media controversies.
[00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:53.403]  They're normally distractions or diversions.
[00:02:53.763 --> 00:02:58.545]  But this is a very serious issue and multi-tiered, multi-layered.
[00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:04.348]  And I figured when I heard Friday that Bush was probably going to nominate him, and he has officially nominated him this morning,
[00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:10.438]  That he would just sail through, but even Republican leaders are saying he lied to Congress.
[00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:15.922]  He told us Bush wasn't engaging in warrantless wiretapping with the NSA echelon system.
[00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:18.863]  Hayden doesn't know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:20.104]  Hayden's not good!
[00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:27.249]  Now is this another bait-and-switch where Roe puts somebody out there who'll fall on their face and then someone even worse is put in the position?
[00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:27.989]  It doesn't matter.
[00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.511]  Whoever goes in those positions is going to be evil.
[00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:37.896]  At that level, you know they're new world order, you know they're bad for this country, you know they're destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:42.005]  This entire agenda is anti-American, anti-freedom.
[00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:46.354]  So we'll get into that as well.
[00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:49.555]  Also, Iran wants oil markets in the Euros.
[00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:54.316]  We've talked a lot about this in the past, but here it is finally in the Associated Press with some new developments.
[00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:54.976]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:57.757]  Also, currency reserves jump in Russia.
[00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:00.797]  Interesting towards the value of the dollar.
[00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:04.018]  Another very interesting report here.
[00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.339]  This out of London Independent today.
[00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.979]  Electronic smog.
[00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.832]  The cause of the mobile phone age.
[00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:14.014]  The curse of the mobile phone age.
[00:04:14.514 --> 00:04:24.319]  Around your home there are countless gadgets whose electronic fields, scientists now warn, are linked to depression, miscarriage, and cancer.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.522]  So we'll get into this article by Jeffrey Lean, Environment Editor.
[00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:33.645]  And I don't normally get into government waste, fraud, and abuse.
[00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:35.486]  The little stuff.
[00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:37.587]  Oh, this politician
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.004]  ...paid for his phone calls with government money, or this politician did this or that.
[00:04:44.405 --> 00:04:46.306]  I try to focus in on the big issues.
[00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.029]  Well, this one is a big issue.
[00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.172]  Guess how much Bush's new Marine One helicopter costs?
[00:04:54.813 --> 00:04:56.534]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[00:04:56.594 --> 00:04:58.856]  It's an example of the crazy spending.
[00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:08.130]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.831]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:12.232]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:14.453]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:19.676]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:24.038]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:26.059]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:36.783]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:38.823]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:42.905]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the info war.
[00:05:43.005 --> 00:05:44.566]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:45.066]  That's 888-2533139.

[00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:09.457]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:20.961]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.782]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.162 --> 00:06:30.629]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.671]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:38.877]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:44.803]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.123 --> 00:06:49.049]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:49.770]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.491]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:04.117]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:06.399]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:13.604]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:22.431]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:07.599]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:27.951]  A report out of Popular Science today tells us that the scientific research to produce
[00:08:28.897 --> 00:08:33.025]  The new Marine One Presidential Helicopter
[00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:41.389]  is 6.1 billion dollars or 6,100,000,000 dollars.
[00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.431]  The President's new helicopter by Jonathan Keats.
[00:08:46.031 --> 00:09:02.520]  After decades of upgrades to a fleet of notoriously cramped Sikorsky VH-3 Sea Kings, the White House has tasked Lockheed Martin with a dramatic 6.1 billion makeover of Marine One, the presidential helicopter, starting this summer.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.082]  The goal to fit a mobile oval office into the tight quarters of a chomper.
[00:09:08.562 --> 00:09:12.483]  The new fleet will consist of 23 VH-71 aircraft.
[00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:17.705]  Each will have 200 square feet of cabin, nearly double the Sea King's 116.
[00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:32.750]  And the birds will cost $110 million apiece when they're delivered, but most of the $6.1 billion goes into research and development just to produce, just to have the design for the helicopter.
[00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:38.475]  I mean, how many giant buildings could they construct?
[00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:39.795]  How many schools?
[00:09:40.216 --> 00:09:41.356]  How many dams?
[00:09:43.238 --> 00:09:48.201]  In fact, this is the equivalent of a moon mission.
[00:09:50.395 --> 00:09:51.156]  6.1 billion.
[00:09:51.176 --> 00:09:52.897]  I mean, you talk about a scam.
[00:09:53.397 --> 00:09:58.621]  You talk about $500 hammers and $800 toilet seats.
[00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:00.122]  Remember that back during the 80s?
[00:10:00.503 --> 00:10:06.087]  Thousands and thousands of orders for $400, $500 hammers.
[00:10:06.107 --> 00:10:07.768]  $750 something dollars if you want to be precise.
[00:10:09.169 --> 00:10:10.030]  Toilet seats.
[00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:14.373]  This is how payoffs are made.
[00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.942]  This is how it's done.
[00:10:18.322 --> 00:10:20.522]  And of course, Sikorsky isn't getting the contract.
[00:10:20.622 --> 00:10:22.663]  Lockheed Martin is.
[00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:27.104]  And guess whose wife sits on the board of directors of Lockheed Martin?
[00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:29.305]  His name is Dick Cheney.
[00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.025]  Her name is Lynn Cheney.
[00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:34.746]  And she sits on the board of Lockheed Martin.
[00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:41.324]  And this is just a 21st century version of $700 plus toilet seats.
[00:10:41.404 --> 00:10:42.725]  That's all this is.
[00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:45.888]  And this is really nothing compared to the other corruption.
[00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:52.534]  I mean, we know that Halliburton will get $15 million in one case to put up a blue tarp and call it a building.
[00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:56.110]  We know that at every level, they're war profiteering.
[00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.192]  We know that over $3 trillion is missing from the Pentagon.
[00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:06.256]  They've sucked many of the pension funds and many of the investment funds that the Pentagon had made over 50 years.
[00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:08.277]  They've sucked many of those dry.
[00:11:08.797 --> 00:11:11.819]  So just rampant, wild corruption going on.
[00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.460]  And obviously, again, I'm non-partisan.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.181]  The Democrats did this as well.
[00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:16.262]  It's just getting worse.
[00:11:16.822 --> 00:11:33.256]  And worse, and more and more arrogant, and more and more just pell-mell, helter-skelter, and it's indicative of a government completely over the edge, a freight train out of control, just wildly doing whatever they want, Marie Antoinette, let the meat take.
[00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:48.627]  So there you have it, $6.1 billion to design the new helicopter that is for use just by the executive branch, and then to pay on top of that $110 million per bird, and they're buying a fleet of these.
[00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:58.354]  Amazing, absolutely amazing to see this happening.
[00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:02.557]  Alright, now let's get into General Hayden.
[00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:07.341]  Michael V. Hayden, then we'll get into what's happening with the oil bores, the Iranian oil bores.
[00:12:07.881 --> 00:12:11.404]  Now, finally in the Associated Press, years after we've been talking about it.
[00:12:13.217 --> 00:12:15.058]  We have General Hayden.
[00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:19.899]  Now remember, this is the guy, and actually in my new film I have clips of this, the new film I'm working on.
[00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:28.902]  We spent a few minutes on Hayden himself, so we're somewhat informed on him, but now the world is becoming aware of the former head of the NSA who stepped down late last year.
[00:12:29.262 --> 00:12:36.084]  He then went to the National Press Club, part of a speaking tour he did, telling everyone that we don't need judges anymore.
[00:12:36.104 --> 00:12:37.664]  I actually have him on tape saying this.
[00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:39.425]  We don't need judges anymore.
[00:12:39.445 --> 00:12:39.765]  No, no, no.
[00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:48.410]  The Pentagon decides, and the Justice Department decides, and he said, don't worry, we have a group of colonels.
[00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:56.735]  We have a group of colonels who are at the NSA, and they decide who gets to be spied on and who doesn't.
[00:12:57.015 --> 00:13:06.100]  Don't worry, they're very well trained, and we don't need those pesky judges, or even the FISA Court, which itself is a horrible rubber stamp.
[00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:09.733]  And then people say, well this is to keep us safe from terrorists.
[00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:11.914]  There is no real terrorist threat.
[00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.036]  The former Delta Force Commander has gone public.
[00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:16.157]  Members of Congress have gone public.
[00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:18.639]  Members of the CIA have gone public.
[00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:20.980]  And remember, our borders are wide open.
[00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:29.967]  Terrorism predominantly, that is any sophisticated attacks that we've seen in modern history in the last hundred years, have been governmental in nature.
[00:13:30.487 --> 00:13:31.768]  Are there real suicide bombings?
[00:13:31.808 --> 00:13:33.068]  Are there real suicide stabbings?
[00:13:33.108 --> 00:13:34.709]  Are there real suicide shootings?
[00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:39.531]  Yes, that stuff goes on in the Middle East, Central Asia, Europe, and sometimes even the Western world.
[00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:46.954]  But any of these massive coordinated attacks, these are staged events to scare the population into submission.
[00:13:47.274 --> 00:13:49.515]  But right now, let's just go ahead and play a clip.
[00:13:50.442 --> 00:14:01.258]  of Hayden from a few months ago when the reporter confronts him and then Hayden comes back and says that the Fourth Amendment never talks about probable cause.
[00:14:01.278 --> 00:14:02.019]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:04.352]  Isn't that an exciting clip?
[00:14:22.922 --> 00:14:26.303]  Uh, protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:27.764]  That's what it says.
[00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:30.185]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:32.545]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:34.146]  But does it not say probable... No.
[00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:37.507]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:39.368]  The legal standard is probable cause.
[00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:47.510]  Just to be very clear, okay, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the fourth.
[00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:48.951]  Right?
[00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:52.172]  And it is a reasonable standard in the fourth amendment.
[00:14:53.496 --> 00:15:03.489]  To quote the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in its entirety, the one the General and the NSA folks are so familiar with and know is about reasonableness and not about probable cause, quote,
[00:15:04.053 --> 00:15:23.981]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[00:15:25.282 --> 00:15:27.743]  Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[00:15:28.852 --> 00:15:32.237]  Yes, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[00:15:32.297 --> 00:15:36.263]  And this is the type of lawyer word games they play.
[00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:41.051]  It's like state police across the nation have been given federal guidelines, have been given federal seminars.
[00:15:41.678 --> 00:15:48.822]  Where they have taught them over the last six, seven years that, oh, yes, you can randomly search any cars you want.
[00:15:48.842 --> 00:15:54.466]  You can shut down whole highways and search everyone as long as you don't discriminate.
[00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:56.247]  As long as you just randomly search.
[00:15:56.327 --> 00:16:00.329]  Or they say, oh, if you think it's reasonable, it's okay.
[00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:21.310]  But if you read the Fourth Amendment, it defines what reasonable is, and that's probable cause, and it defines probable cause as a witness sworn in on the record testifying specifically to the things that are going to be searched, the people that are going to be searched, the places, the papers, what they're going after, the effects.
[00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:24.352]  That's the bottom line.
[00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:35.093]  But now, from Miami to New York City, we see cases every week in the news, on the different law sites, where they're having secret dockets.
[00:16:35.133 --> 00:16:39.275]  They arrest people and say, well, we can't let any press or any witnesses in.
[00:16:39.295 --> 00:16:40.655]  This is a secret drug case.
[00:16:40.995 --> 00:16:43.636]  We can't let the drug dealers know who our informants are.
[00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:47.718]  And so, you're not even going to get your day in court.
[00:16:48.338 --> 00:17:05.381]  Or, I'm sure you heard of the case a few weeks ago when they said, oh we've arrested some people, we haven't even charged them or indicted them for having drugs yet, but part of asset forfeiture seizure, we're going to take their cars, their houses, and we're going to pull their gold fillings out, their gold crowns out of their mouth.
[00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:15.163]  The first stop before they even went to jail was to the dentist office, but by then the lawyer had been alerted and the dentist was questioning this so it didn't happen.
[00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:17.183]  But it shows the craziness
[00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:20.620]  The craziness of this system.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.703]  Now, let's get into Hayden.
[00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:28.725]  Hayden would be wrong person for CIA post New York Daily News.
[00:17:28.785 --> 00:17:31.027]  I was pleased once I started hearing this yesterday.
[00:17:31.907 --> 00:17:34.209]  I heard on Friday afternoon that he would be the nominee.
[00:17:34.269 --> 00:17:38.692]  Bush has now nominated him to be the head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:44.496]  And right away, Republican and Democrat members of Congress said, Hey, wait a minute!
[00:17:45.755 --> 00:18:04.304]  Members of Congress have charged him, I don't mean criminally, that they have made the charge that Mr. Hayden lied to Congress, because before he went around giving those speeches and before Bush went public saying, okay, I authorize warrantless searches, that's now admitted, Hayden went before Congress and said, that's ridiculous, we always use warrants.
[00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:09.206]  Bush had gone on TV, we played those clips, saying we always use warrants.
[00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:12.708]  And then once they get caught, they say, we don't need no stinking warrants.
[00:18:13.228 --> 00:18:14.749]  We don't need no stinking badges.
[00:18:15.905 --> 00:18:20.156]  Hayden would be wrong person for the CIA post lawmakers say.
[00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:28.218]  The general presumed to be President Bush's choice to head the CIA could be in for a tough confirmation process leading Republicans and Democrats said Sunday.
[00:18:28.238 --> 00:18:34.143]  At issue for Republicans is whether a career military man like Air Force General Michael Hayden should head the agency at this time.
[00:18:47.182 --> 00:18:52.244]  Bottom line, I do believe he's the wrong person, the wrong place, at the wrong time.
[00:18:52.424 --> 00:19:08.171]  Peter Hoekstra, Republican Michigan, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Fox News Sunday, we should not have a military person leading a civilian agency at this time.
[00:19:08.812 --> 00:19:13.214]  Again, that gets into posse comitatus, and Bush is the only president since
[00:19:17.384 --> 00:19:24.166]  Our founding father, George Washington, to march around in a military uniform, and Washington didn't even do that after he was elected president.
[00:19:24.506 --> 00:19:31.848]  You could argue that the rough rider did, but he liked to wear his old military uniforms when he was out hunting Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:19:32.888 --> 00:19:33.908]  So that doesn't really count.
[00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:44.371]  Regardless of how good Mike is, putting a general in charge is going to send the wrong signal, said the Republican congressman who added that relations between the CIA and the Department of Defense have been strained.
[00:19:45.382 --> 00:19:49.585]  We'll come back and get into the dirt on Hayden and the dirt on Porter Goss.
[00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:54.829]  White Gossy resigned Friday, which shocked many.
[00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.290]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.413]  InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com are the websites.
[00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:04.082]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.422 --> 00:20:07.203]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.483 --> 00:20:11.626]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:12.886]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.206 --> 00:20:17.769]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:20.370]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:35.575]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:35.615 --> 00:20:42.737]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:21:01.124 --> 00:21:02.104]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.204 --> 00:21:06.966]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:14.948]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:20.570]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:27.752]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:33.394]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.654 --> 00:21:38.376]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:46.299]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:52.903]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.223 --> 00:21:56.746]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.086 --> 00:21:57.646]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.766 --> 00:22:03.610]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:10.955]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:22:12.135 --> 00:22:14.377]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:21.461]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:30.467]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:39.353]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:41.694]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800
[00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:43.726]  516-8736.
[00:22:43.746 --> 00:22:44.406]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:44.647]  Call now.
[00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:47.028]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:00.874 --> 00:23:02.737]  Gas prices are out of control.
[00:23:02.957 --> 00:23:07.104]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[00:23:07.484 --> 00:23:12.011]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:16.698]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using
[00:23:16.758 --> 00:23:17.719]  We're good to go!
[00:23:36.255 --> 00:23:36.916]  I think so.
[00:24:04.187 --> 00:24:06.671]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:09.915]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:13.320]  What does that liner signify?
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.082]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:24:16.124 --> 00:24:17.566]  Evil always fails in the end.
[00:24:17.586 --> 00:24:19.789]  It always falls of its own weight and treachery.
[00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.422]  We have the facts.
[00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:22.423]  We have the evidence.
[00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:23.644]  We understand what's going on.
[00:24:23.664 --> 00:24:25.465]  We're going to educate the American people.
[00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:26.847]  We're going to take this country back.
[00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:36.435]  You know, KLBJ 590 AM, just a marquee station, one of the most successful in the state of Texas, formerly owned by President Johnson, now owned by Emmes Communications.
[00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:41.667]  They, of course, are trying to figure out a way to pick up my syndicated show.
[00:24:41.707 --> 00:24:47.809]  The problem is I'm on up against Rush Limbaugh, who they carry, so they're trying to look at ways to carry it at night before George Norrie comes on.
[00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.431]  So they said, hey, why don't you come by and do a Sunday show just to get to know the folks?
[00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:59.374]  I mean, I've co-hosted a Coast to Coast AM with George Norrie before out of the same studio when he was here in town, but they wanted me to come by and meet the folks again.
[00:24:59.394 --> 00:25:01.455]  And there I was.
[00:25:01.515 --> 00:25:03.236]  I took 30 calls in the second hour.
[00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:05.997]  I took 15 calls in the first hour.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.921]  And no one called in disagreeing.
[00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:10.501]  They said they'd never seen that.
[00:25:11.201 --> 00:25:15.882]  And almost all the calls with comments to the board operator and the producer were positive.
[00:25:15.902 --> 00:25:19.643]  There was one person that was being a little bit negative about me being on the air.
[00:25:19.963 --> 00:25:22.244]  And there I was, again, mainstream radio.
[00:25:22.744 --> 00:25:30.446]  This show's on mainstream AM and FM affiliates right now, but on a big establishment station, a blue-chip station, and no one calling in to disagree.
[00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:33.967]  And I talked to Mark Caesar after the show, and he was just amazed by it.
[00:25:34.027 --> 00:25:35.187]  I told him, I said, listen,
[00:25:35.879 --> 00:25:37.980]  And he said, I bet you'll get people calling and disagreeing here.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.001]  And I said, I bet I don't.
[00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:42.722]  Now, you're always welcome to call in and disagree with me.
[00:25:42.742 --> 00:25:47.405]  I mean, normally it's, you know, Alex, you don't hate Jews, so we don't like you.
[00:25:48.045 --> 00:25:50.746]  Or Alex, you don't hate blacks, so we don't like you.
[00:25:50.786 --> 00:25:53.808]  I mean, that's about as much disagreement as I get.
[00:25:54.736 --> 00:26:04.262]  Just that I'm not radical enough, or I don't believe the Pope runs everything, and I won't have a certain author on and say that they're basically God.
[00:26:04.922 --> 00:26:06.303]  That's the type of disagreement I get.
[00:26:06.503 --> 00:26:15.829]  But I don't get disagreement about the fact that we're going into a world government, that they're getting rid of our borders, that the dollar's been devalued, that our government's tyrannical, that our government's staged terror attacks in the past.
[00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:24.679]  The main premise of this broadcast, that government's tyrannical and out of control, and has to be brought to heel, is not debated.
[00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:35.813]  And to see the change in the last 11-12 years, since I started my own little personal crusade, has been extremely fulfilling, extremely gratifying, and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.
[00:26:37.114 --> 00:26:39.179]  I really have, and we have the momentum.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.161]  The momentum.
[00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:44.231]  We feel like we're the minority out here, but we're not the minority.
[00:26:44.351 --> 00:26:46.235]  Now, General Hayden
[00:26:47.142 --> 00:26:50.005]  This guy is a real piece of work.
[00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:52.688]  And here's an article that Steve Watson and I put together this weekend.
[00:26:52.728 --> 00:26:53.709]  He did the lion's share of the work.
[00:26:53.729 --> 00:26:54.349]  He did a great job.
[00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.693]  Next, CIA head back spying on citizens.
[00:26:58.173 --> 00:27:02.198]  Doesn't understand Fourth Amendment, the domination of Negroponte's right-hand man.
[00:27:02.778 --> 00:27:10.246]  To have the CIA signifies a further crackdown on civil liberties and the forging ahead of the semi-secret Total Information Awareness Program.
[00:27:11.076 --> 00:27:29.664]  General Michael V. Hayden is the favorite and now has been nominated to step up to take the head position at the CIA after the resignation of Porter J. Goss who stepped down in advance of the revelations that he and a top aide may have attended Watergate poker parties where brimes and hookers were provided to corrupt congressmen.
[00:27:30.262 --> 00:27:31.343]  Now, we know he went to the parties.
[00:27:31.363 --> 00:27:35.786]  We don't know if he took bribes or took of the hookers.
[00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:42.451]  Hayden is National Intelligence Director John Negroponte's senior deputy, number two over, quote, all intelligence.
[00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:43.472]  What a spooky title.
[00:27:44.693 --> 00:27:56.862]  Negroponte's job is to coordinate the work of 16 different intelligence agencies, including the CIA and the giant National Security Agency, which eavesdrops on international communications, as well as the Energy Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
[00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:59.610]  That'll be good for them to be able to control all that.
[00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:02.072]  They want to stop the drugs.
[00:28:02.152 --> 00:28:03.032]  Sure they do.
[00:28:03.613 --> 00:28:19.743]  The role was created immediately after 9-11 and ties in with the Defense Department's Total Information Awareness Program, which seeks to gather lifetime paper trail, every purchase, everything you do, on all citizens and centralizes the information on a giant grand database.
[00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:26.165]  The coordination of all intelligence gathering services by Negroponte is the first step of the nightmarish Orwellian police state.
[00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:30.508]  It's also meant so intelligence agencies can't stop terror at the globalist stage.
[00:28:30.828 --> 00:28:31.609]  It's one of the big reasons.
[00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.553]  They have a problem with agencies stopping terror over and over again, stopping other branches of the government's ops.
[00:28:38.493 --> 00:28:41.675]  The excuse for all of this is, of course, the war on terror.
[00:28:41.775 --> 00:28:47.419]  It has been claimed that Porter Goss was out of his depth as CIA head and was merely a puppet who failed to toe the line.
[00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:55.544]  According to some intelligence officials, he had been standing up for the CIA as an autonomous agency and was holding firm against micromanagement.
[00:28:55.604 --> 00:29:05.210]  Tensions came to a boil when Negroponte decided that many analysts from the CIA should be centralized and move to the new National Counterterrorism Center.
[00:29:05.828 --> 00:29:11.130]  Negroponte is a neocon stalwart who has been lurking in the shadows as long as Cheney and Rumsfeld.
[00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.532]  He was a key figure behind the invasion of Iraq, having served as ambassador there.
[00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:24.936]  So you're welcome to talk about Hayden and the rest of it, and how Republicans are freaking out over Posse Comitatus, which I'm pleased to see, as well as Democrats.
[00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:26.217]  Toll free number 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:30.922 --> 00:29:33.944]  Iran's leader, Vice President Bush, will tell you what he had to say later.
[00:29:34.324 --> 00:29:41.247]  We'll get more into the Iranian oil boreshitting, the Associated Press, and some interesting police state news here domestically, and a lot more.
[00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:45.669]  Michael Berger of 9-11 Truth will be joining us as well with some big announcements.
[00:29:46.049 --> 00:29:46.510]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.552 --> 00:29:51.452]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.932 --> 00:29:53.513]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.533 --> 00:29:57.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:13.854 --> 00:31:17.357]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:21.839]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:26.041]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:26.281 --> 00:31:32.804]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:38.506]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:38.746 --> 00:31:45.668]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:01.698]  Come on, Bill.
[00:32:01.918 --> 00:32:07.079]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[00:32:07.419 --> 00:32:08.900]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.802]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:17.082 --> 00:32:23.344]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:23.664 --> 00:32:25.865]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:26.185 --> 00:32:29.026]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[00:32:29.546 --> 00:32:32.988]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[00:32:33.008 --> 00:32:33.689]  Whoa!
[00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:35.230]  What was that website again?
[00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.792]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:40.212]  Now write this down, John.
[00:32:40.352 --> 00:32:44.635]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:32:44.795 --> 00:32:45.375]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:32:45.656 --> 00:32:46.856]  I'm going there right now.
[00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:47.897]  Check, please!
[00:32:49.662 --> 00:32:51.145]  Uh, you got this one right, Bill.
[00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:52.227]  Sure, John.
[00:32:52.447 --> 00:32:56.835]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:58.839]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:32:58.979 --> 00:32:59.260]  Deal?
[00:33:15.623 --> 00:33:22.890]  Mark, John, Leslie, Ken, Peter, others, your calls are coming up so remember to join us 800-259-9231.
[00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:39.407]  Before I get back to your calls and then get into more news concerning Iran, several big developments there, we've already sold a tenth of the tickets to my big 9-11 event I'm going to have in Los Angeles, California.
[00:33:40.524 --> 00:33:45.926]  Coming up on the 24th and 25th of June next month at the Sheraton Downtown.
[00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:49.708]  We've already sold a tenth of the tickets.
[00:33:50.648 --> 00:33:53.530]  Seriously folks, do not procrastinate.
[00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.451]  It is very important.
[00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:58.872]  The hall holds a thousand people.
[00:33:58.932 --> 00:34:01.133]  It holds a little more than that, but we're going to try to keep it to a thousand.
[00:34:01.153 --> 00:34:03.874]  If it goes over, we can get more seats in there.
[00:34:04.654 --> 00:34:06.055]  Do not procrastinate.
[00:34:06.869 --> 00:34:14.573]  Because we launched this Friday and then as of this morning we had already sold 100 tickets roughly.
[00:34:14.653 --> 00:34:15.933]  I think it's actually more than that.
[00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:27.559]  So 10% of the tickets gone and we've got 40 something days until the event that is coming up again in late June.
[00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.592]  So, my friends, you seriously do not want to miss this.
[00:34:34.152 --> 00:34:37.393]  Professor Stephen Jones, BYU, is confirmed.
[00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:46.356]  Bob Bowman, Dr. Bob Bowman, Colonel Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program when it was secret, under Jimmy Carter, will be there talking about 9-11 minute inside job.
[00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:48.256]  I just talked to Ray McGovern this morning.
[00:34:48.276 --> 00:34:49.417]  There's a good chance he'll be there.
[00:34:49.437 --> 00:34:52.798]  He's still conferring with his wife over some family things they're doing.
[00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:58.333]  We've got Dylan Avery coming to show Loose Change 2nd Edition and also some treats, some new stuff for you.
[00:34:58.353 --> 00:35:01.535]  We're going to be showing my new film that doesn't even have a name yet.
[00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:04.477]  I've got the name, but I haven't announced that yet.
[00:35:04.777 --> 00:35:06.018]  It'll be done right around that time.
[00:35:06.678 --> 00:35:09.760]  Whether it's totally done or partially done, it's going to be done.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.941]  It's almost done now.
[00:35:11.261 --> 00:35:12.882]  We're going to be premiering that there.
[00:35:13.463 --> 00:35:16.925]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming, Professor Jim Fetzer coming.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:38.926]  It is just going to be a wonderful event, and it's going to go Saturday from about 11 in the morning until about 8 or 9 at night, and then Sunday from 10 in the morning until 8 or 9 at night, and we're going to show at least one film every day, probably two films every day, and then have speakers and question and answers and roundtable discussions.
[00:35:40.987 --> 00:35:46.749]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com, and up at the top of the main page there's a banner to it, or there's a banner on InfoWars.com
[00:35:48.204 --> 00:35:55.046]  And we have the website AmericanScholarsSymposium.com.
[00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:59.668]  And you definitely want to go visit the site and get your tickets now.
[00:35:59.708 --> 00:36:08.270]  AmericanScholarsSymposium.org.
[00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:11.731]  And we've got some of the itinerary up there.
[00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:16.233]  We're going to be putting the full program up in the next few days.
[00:36:17.214 --> 00:36:24.021]  And it's going to be unlike any other 9-11 meeting, 9-11 event that you have seen to date.
[00:36:24.702 --> 00:36:29.547]  And it will be the first that I have orchestrated or sponsored or created.
[00:36:30.515 --> 00:36:33.058]  I'm also going to be at a 9-11 event in Chicago.
[00:36:33.078 --> 00:36:34.720]  We'll be talking about that in the next hour.
[00:36:35.221 --> 00:36:43.571]  Coming up the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th up in Chicago is being put on by 9-11 Truth and some of their folks are also going to be at my event.
[00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:49.337]  So just a lot of things happening and this is going to be great because we're going to videotape it and make a documentary out of it.
[00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:56.589]  The LA Conference, and we're also going to have the national media there.
[00:36:56.609 --> 00:37:03.493]  I mean, I've had calls from people like 60 Minutes in the last week, and organizations like that are probably going to be at the event.
[00:37:03.874 --> 00:37:06.155]  Big media risers, they can put all their cameras up.
[00:37:06.816 --> 00:37:15.261]  And we're billing it as the American Scholars Symposium, 9-11, the Neocon Agenda, National Education Research Conference.
[00:37:15.902 --> 00:37:17.743]  And it's two days of 9-11 truth.
[00:37:17.963 --> 00:37:19.084]  Face the facts.
[00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.951]  Two days of 9-11 truth, face the facts.
[00:37:22.971 --> 00:37:27.311]  We're going to throw the gauntlet down to the mainstream media and tell them, you need to face the facts.
[00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:32.552]  We're also going to get into Iraq and the ongoing neocon agenda and what's happening with Iran.
[00:37:34.533 --> 00:37:40.133]  I understand about 25-30% of our audience doesn't like computers, doesn't buy things over computers.
[00:37:41.014 --> 00:37:48.995]  We have a secure online, tix.com, you know, one of the biggest online ticketing services, a secure server that we're linked to that's selling the tickets.
[00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:49.879]  I think so.
[00:38:12.617 --> 00:38:13.158]  I think so.
[00:38:27.882 --> 00:38:36.008]  And it is built onto a modern major shopping mall with an entire food court and, I'm told, five separate restaurants.
[00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:42.473]  So there's a whole food court of dozens of restaurants, you know, the little food courts with pizza and hamburgers and salads and all that stuff.
[00:38:42.773 --> 00:38:51.619]  And then there's, I'm told, five other major restaurants in the hotel, well, in the mall attached to the hotel itself.
[00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:53.841]  So that's five, six, seven,
[00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:55.170]  Eight.
[00:38:55.630 --> 00:39:00.493]  Eight major restaurants and then the food court and there are a bunch of other restaurants all around it.
[00:39:00.553 --> 00:39:01.754]  It's in downtown LA.
[00:39:02.154 --> 00:39:05.656]  There's only 400 and something rooms there in the hotel.
[00:39:06.457 --> 00:39:13.921]  450, but there are hotel rooms, just hotels all around it of different price ranges.
[00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:20.605]  There's a major highway that runs right by it that has scores of La Quintas and Best Westerns and
[00:39:21.355 --> 00:39:24.796]  Extended stays, I mean, it's just anything you can imagine.
[00:39:24.856 --> 00:39:33.157]  It's all there for you, whether you want to spend $50 on a hotel room a night or $300 on a hotel room a night, whatever your fancy is, you can do that.
[00:39:33.998 --> 00:39:38.559]  It's normally about, what, $170 something dollars a night in the Sheraton.
[00:39:38.819 --> 00:39:44.120]  Our members of this conference get it for, I think, $126 a night.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:49.601]  There's a special number you call to get that if you do want to stay in the hotel.
[00:39:51.261 --> 00:39:54.583]  About that, it's just very exciting, and it's coming up.
[00:39:54.683 --> 00:39:57.404]  We've already sold one-tenth of the tickets.
[00:39:57.484 --> 00:39:59.985]  Ten percent of the tickets are gone.
[00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:05.888]  They're going to go quick, and you're going to be very upset that you didn't get your tickets.
[00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:10.930]  I'm encouraged that a hundred tickets are already gone in three days.
[00:40:12.351 --> 00:40:16.633]  Well, it'll be three days at the end of the show, because I announced it at the end of the third hour Friday.
[00:40:17.838 --> 00:40:20.359]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Boston.
[00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:21.460]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:21.920]  Go ahead.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:22.940]  Hello, Alex.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.561]  Hi.
[00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:31.223]  In light of the recent release of the Flight 93 movie, I have a 9-11 related question.
[00:40:31.564 --> 00:40:31.864]  Okay.
[00:40:32.584 --> 00:40:45.229]  My question is, you know, we've all heard the recordings of people, well, we've all heard, all have heard the recordings of the cockpit of gentlemen saying something to the effect of
[00:40:45.956 --> 00:40:46.837]  Uh, is that it?
[00:40:47.317 --> 00:40:48.378]  Shall we put it down?
[00:40:48.398 --> 00:40:50.980]  Uh, things, things are not light.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.564]  Do you take that as proof that Flight 93 was therefore hijacked?
[00:40:58.268 --> 00:41:02.892]  Well, there's a whole area here that has to be discussed and investigated.
[00:41:02.952 --> 00:41:15.021]  Number one, we have a government that admittedly manufactured false intelligence on Iraq, and we have the memos where they said they were premeditatedly manufacturing the evidence and that Saddam didn't have WMDs.
[00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:27.071]  Now, we have Cheney in September of 2000 in the PENAC document saying, Saddam isn't a threat, but is a convenient pretext to get the resources and use Iraq as a military launch base to project power into Iran and Syria.
[00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:32.993]  Then we have the government, almost four years ago, releasing the Fat Bin Laden tape.
[00:41:33.433 --> 00:41:36.874]  They did voice print according to Bin Laden's real voice, which is 100%.
[00:41:36.934 --> 00:41:42.215]  They voice printed the Fat Bin Laden, and it was not Bin Laden.
[00:41:42.235 --> 00:41:46.697]  Then linguists in France, the US, and Canada at major universities listened to the voice.
[00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:50.638]  It was someone who was Arabic, but who had been raised in the US.
[00:41:51.358 --> 00:41:58.921]  So we had heavy Canadian, US, North American, English overtones.
[00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:03.522]  And then they did face prints off of the video.
[00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:06.563]  They tried to turn the lights down so you couldn't tell, but they still did it.
[00:42:06.603 --> 00:42:08.124]  The nose was completely different.
[00:42:08.544 --> 00:42:10.184]  The cheekbones were completely different.
[00:42:10.524 --> 00:42:12.465]  It was a made-up take.
[00:42:13.283 --> 00:42:15.744]  Just like these Zakari outtakes.
[00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:16.965]  I believe he's a government stooge.
[00:42:17.005 --> 00:42:17.905]  Many others have said that.
[00:42:17.945 --> 00:42:20.406]  Even people in our own government have gone public saying that.
[00:42:20.446 --> 00:42:25.189]  I believe they did the little stupid outtakes of him not knowing how to shoot the machine gun by design.
[00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:28.790]  We have a government who said they wanted to paint up an American plane like a U.N.
[00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.852]  plane and get it shot down to blame it on Iraq.
[00:42:32.692 --> 00:42:36.034]  We have a government that has computer programs
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.402]  Where they could show Alex Jones robbing a bank.
[00:42:39.942 --> 00:42:41.703]  They could put my head on somebody else.
[00:42:41.763 --> 00:42:45.245]  They could engineer the whole thing in just a few hours now.
[00:42:45.305 --> 00:42:53.350]  In the past it would take weeks or months with a special effects expert to do it where you couldn't tell it was manufactured.
[00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.392]  But now it just takes a few hours, sir.
[00:42:56.952 --> 00:42:59.694]  In fact, if we wanted to, we could fake stuff.
[00:43:00.394 --> 00:43:02.475]  Those programs are now out on the open market.
[00:43:02.596 --> 00:43:02.956]  Also,
[00:43:05.552 --> 00:43:14.154]  Every two years, technology systems and databases and their ability to compress is roughly doubling, and that's exponential.
[00:43:15.114 --> 00:43:31.057]  So, back when 9-11 took place, Mark, you could go buy a very expensive computer program, a proprietary program, but you could pay for it, and you could pay tens of thousands of dollars for it, and then you could talk into a speaker,
[00:43:31.917 --> 00:43:38.203]  And that would, or into a microphone, and then it would go into the computer and real-time record it in someone else's voice.
[00:43:38.243 --> 00:43:44.228]  As long as you had a sampling of the other individual's voice, real-time it can fake it.
[00:43:44.928 --> 00:43:50.333]  So, we know that their official story, and do you guys put him on hold until I go back to him?
[00:43:50.353 --> 00:43:52.855]  That way we don't just have an open line with noises in the background?
[00:43:52.895 --> 00:43:53.176]  Thanks.
[00:43:56.198 --> 00:43:57.980]  Let me just go back to what I was saying, excuse me.
[00:43:59.986 --> 00:44:00.648]  Let me explain this.
[00:44:01.029 --> 00:44:04.056]  Their official story has been proven to be a fraud.
[00:44:04.096 --> 00:44:08.828]  The government's official story has been proven to be a fraud at every level, at every fashion.
[00:44:09.716 --> 00:44:23.606]  From end to end, up one side and down the other, we know what they officially tell us about the two flights that hit the World Trade Centers, about the supposed flight that hit the Pentagon, and the Shanksville, Pennsylvania crash of Flight 93.
[00:44:24.006 --> 00:44:25.967]  We know their official stories are a lie.
[00:44:26.268 --> 00:44:28.029]  We know they planted evidence before.
[00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:34.233]  We know they planted passports at three locations, North and South Towers and Pennsylvania.
[00:44:34.253 --> 00:44:35.454]  It gets more and more ridiculous.
[00:44:36.067 --> 00:44:42.808]  We know that on top of it they claim that cell phone calls were made, and I don't mean the in-flight phones, okay?
[00:44:42.828 --> 00:44:43.949]  I'm not talking about those.
[00:44:44.869 --> 00:45:00.252]  They, in their official story, whenever they had the Solicitor General go on TV within hours and say that he got calls from his wife and others, and that's where the stories of the calls first came from.
[00:45:00.612 --> 00:45:05.793]  Then months and months later they announced they had the calls, and then now they've released tiny clips of calls.
[00:45:06.867 --> 00:45:15.714]  And you cannot, after 1,500 feet, people have done this test, it's admitted, a normal cell phone does not work.
[00:45:16.254 --> 00:45:21.277]  I've tested it, many of my friends have tested it, but the airlines admit it does not work.
[00:45:21.578 --> 00:45:24.260]  Now these are calls at 20,000 to 33,000 feet.
[00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:26.561]  It's a joke.
[00:45:26.621 --> 00:45:34.587]  Now we hear about federal regulators trying to change the law and allow companies to develop technology with cell phones that will work in flight.
[00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:40.688]  And they're saying it just won't work, because the towers project out only to about 2,000 feet.
[00:45:41.028 --> 00:45:41.909]  They're angulated.
[00:45:41.949 --> 00:45:43.510]  They're basically microwave towers.
[00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.510]  It does not work.
[00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:46.891]  So how did those calls work?
[00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:49.832]  Then you can say, well, what about the cockpit tapes?
[00:45:50.133 --> 00:45:51.813]  The FAA was ordered to shred the tapes.
[00:45:52.273 --> 00:45:55.735]  The FBI ordered firefighters to give them the black boxes at Ground Zero.
[00:45:55.755 --> 00:45:58.036]  Three of them that were found undamaged to ship them off.
[00:45:58.076 --> 00:45:59.117]  And then they said they never had them.
[00:45:59.437 --> 00:46:01.137]  It's just all lies, sir.
[00:46:01.478 --> 00:46:03.679]  To try to chronicle the lies makes my head spin.
[00:46:03.699 --> 00:46:04.439]  You go ahead now, Mark.
[00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.043]  I guess, in other words, your answer is no.
[00:46:08.283 --> 00:46:09.323]  It's not plausible.
[00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:13.044]  My follow-up to that would be a simple question.
[00:46:13.584 --> 00:46:29.029]  Is it plausible to believe that literally dozens of family members could be fooled by pre-recorded, I suppose, conversations and so forth, and to have that work in real time?
[00:46:30.729 --> 00:46:31.910]  What is the possibility?
[00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.610]  It seems to me
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.221]  That the possibility of that is extraordinary for that to happen.
[00:46:37.301 --> 00:46:41.122]  Well, Mark, do you off the top of your head remember how many calls were made total?
[00:46:41.602 --> 00:46:42.663]  Off the top of my head, I do not.
[00:46:43.223 --> 00:46:45.584]  I believe it's only five calls.
[00:46:45.964 --> 00:46:46.864]  Now that's from memory.
[00:46:48.144 --> 00:46:51.945]  And I just told you that the official story is a fraud.
[00:46:52.365 --> 00:46:54.086]  And you can't debate any of those points I made.
[00:46:54.961 --> 00:47:06.366]  And you've called before and you just sit there and you disagree, which I think is great because I'd like to be able to argue this with you, but you never respond to any of the points I bring up.
[00:47:06.566 --> 00:47:17.670]  Sir, are you denying that it is admitted fact, scientific, incontrovertible fact, that cell phones do not work over 1,500 feet in moving aircraft?
[00:47:19.466 --> 00:47:20.927]  Well, I myself, two points.
[00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:23.510]  A, I literally don't know the answer to that.
[00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:24.090]  No, that's good.
[00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:24.751]  I'm sure you don't.
[00:47:25.131 --> 00:47:28.894]  Well, listen, I mean, we're not all as well... Put him on hold for a second.
[00:47:29.775 --> 00:47:31.817]  Sir, I know, we're not all as informed as me.
[00:47:31.857 --> 00:47:36.120]  Let's be patronizing and act like I'm an elitist and try to get some weak minds on your side.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.103]  We're dealing with a really bad person right now, folks.
[00:47:39.143 --> 00:47:40.964]  I want you to know I've assessed this individual.
[00:47:41.865 --> 00:47:42.766]  Let me tell you something, Mac.
[00:47:43.869 --> 00:47:51.111]  You called two or three times in the last few months, and you brought this up before Memory Serves, and I've argued the phone calls with you.
[00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:55.092]  Now I demand you go do a Google search and research this.
[00:47:55.432 --> 00:47:57.912]  Cell phones do not work over 1,500 feet.
[00:47:58.552 --> 00:48:00.173]  The maximum they've ever been found to work is 2,000.
[00:48:00.613 --> 00:48:03.054]  So I don't want to hear it from you.
[00:48:03.574 --> 00:48:05.994]  Now I want you to respond specifically.
[00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:07.875]  You say, what's my opinion?
[00:48:07.975 --> 00:48:08.935]  I give you facts.
[00:48:09.745 --> 00:48:13.067]  Okay, and then you don't respond to that.
[00:48:13.448 --> 00:48:15.869]  Now I'm asking you, are you next time you call?
[00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:17.530]  You can call back tomorrow.
[00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:18.751]  I'll have you on as a guest tomorrow.
[00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:32.458]  Will you go, Mark, and will you go research if cell phones work and then find out that the majority, I think three of the five calls they say, came from regular cell phones at over 30,000 feet?
[00:48:32.518 --> 00:48:35.939]  Now, will you or will you not face that and deal with that with me?
[00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:37.099]  Go ahead.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.901]  Well, of course, that's a fair challenge and I look forward to doing that.
[00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:42.162]  Yeah, I bet you will.
[00:48:44.483 --> 00:48:46.664]  I tell you what, do you have a computer in front of you right now?
[00:48:46.964 --> 00:48:47.744]  In front of me, I do not.
[00:48:48.354 --> 00:48:49.935]  Okay, when are you going to call back in?
[00:48:49.955 --> 00:49:02.224]  I want to hear when you are going to call back in and present to me, because don't you agree that if cell phones don't work at 30,000 feet as some of the calls were made, 30,000 plus, that then the official story is impossible?
[00:49:03.045 --> 00:49:04.386]  Well, of course, that's a fair conclusion.
[00:49:04.406 --> 00:49:11.812]  If they can't, if they scientifically simply cannot be made at that altitude, then of course they have to have been manufactured.
[00:49:11.872 --> 00:49:12.092]  Yes.
[00:49:13.106 --> 00:49:15.367]  Yes, that's a fair challenge, and I look forward to doing it.
[00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:21.268]  My only other question is, how do we know what altitude 93 was flying at?
[00:49:22.248 --> 00:49:25.249]  Well, it was tracked, and the other aircraft were tracked.
[00:49:25.369 --> 00:49:26.449]  You didn't know that?
[00:49:26.469 --> 00:49:29.930]  You thought their altitudes were all registered?
[00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:34.951]  I thought their transponders were off, and therefore the information giving their altitudes.
[00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:38.135]  Anyone, that's why they shredded the tapes.
[00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:42.758]  And it's been admitted, sir, that those planes, they never lost track of those planes, sir.
[00:49:43.178 --> 00:49:49.122]  The systems the FAA has, the systems NORAD have, will track a toy airplane.
[00:49:49.142 --> 00:49:52.825]  You know, these gasoline powered planes that people fly at events.
[00:49:53.305 --> 00:49:56.367]  Those are picked up by the radar, sir.
[00:49:56.447 --> 00:49:58.369]  Birds are picked up by the radar.
[00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:03.652]  You say that it's admitted that 93 was never lost.
[00:50:03.772 --> 00:50:04.573]  Admitted by whom?
[00:50:05.746 --> 00:50:07.207]  Admitted, was never lost.
[00:50:07.448 --> 00:50:08.108]  What does that mean?
[00:50:08.308 --> 00:50:11.371]  Well, you had just said that they had never lost track of Flight 93.
[00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:14.593]  Yeah, Dick Cheney was in the MSNBC Associated Press Reuters.
[00:50:15.214 --> 00:50:29.706]  Dick Cheney was in the bunker, tracking it, and Norman Mineta, one of the secretaries, he gave this testimony, and it's admitted, and the aide comes forward and says, does the order still stand with Flight 93?
[00:50:29.806 --> 00:50:31.868]  And Cheney said, have you heard something to the contrary?
[00:50:33.106 --> 00:50:33.586]  Well, that's right.
[00:50:33.606 --> 00:50:34.347]  That's exactly right.
[00:50:34.387 --> 00:50:37.549]  But that doesn't mean that they were tracking it the entire way.
[00:50:37.769 --> 00:50:37.970]  Ha!
[00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.430]  Ha!
[00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:39.170]  Okay.
[00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:40.391]  Alright.
[00:50:40.611 --> 00:50:41.592]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:43.594]  Try to put your doubts out there.
[00:50:43.854 --> 00:50:45.435]  You're not going to stop the American people.
[00:50:46.796 --> 00:50:48.437]  You're not going to stop the American people.
[00:50:50.979 --> 00:50:51.639]  Amazing.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:52.960]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:55.702]  That's the type of individual we're talking about.
[00:50:55.722 --> 00:50:57.764]  Well, I said I wanted somebody to call and disagree, and they did.
[00:50:58.264 --> 00:50:59.405]  Pretty ham-fisted, though.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.701]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:06.542]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:06.882 --> 00:51:11.564]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:11.904 --> 00:51:16.306]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:16.746 --> 00:51:20.948]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.148 --> 00:51:23.989]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.089 --> 00:51:26.570]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:33.356]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:33.596 --> 00:51:40.822]  Plunge the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.062 --> 00:51:43.484]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:01.047 --> 00:52:07.270]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:13.593]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.873 --> 00:52:22.297]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.538 --> 00:52:29.561]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.881 --> 00:52:34.684]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.904 --> 00:52:40.288]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.648 --> 00:52:43.730]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.071 --> 00:52:52.036]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.076 --> 00:52:52.656]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.124 --> 00:53:02.584]  I think so.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.301]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.159 --> 00:53:50.262]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.422 --> 00:53:56.348]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:56.368 --> 00:54:01.733]  Alright, let's speak to your calls now.
[00:54:01.793 --> 00:54:05.376]  That caller was disagreeing, so we have to stay on longer.
[00:54:05.396 --> 00:54:06.097]  Sorry to the others.
[00:54:14.008 --> 00:54:16.630]  Let's talk to John in Houston, Texas, down in H-Town.
[00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:17.310]  Welcome, John.
[00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:18.311]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:18.851 --> 00:54:23.334]  Alex, I wanted to play a clip from an old World War II movie called China with Alan Ladd.
[00:54:24.095 --> 00:54:29.318]  At the end of the movie, he has a confrontation with a Japanese general, and it's almost like you're talking about today.
[00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:30.839]  It's really interesting.
[00:54:30.859 --> 00:54:31.720]  Well, how long is it?
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.341]  Just about half a minute.
[00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:34.501]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:37.704]  Just make sure your phone's close to the speaker.
[00:54:38.244 --> 00:54:38.404]  Yep.
[00:54:40.646 --> 00:54:41.286]  Here it is!
[00:54:41.306 --> 00:54:41.846]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:54:44.957 --> 00:54:47.217]  They're opposed to the Imperial Japanese government.
[00:54:47.818 --> 00:54:54.179]  Because we and our allies, for the ultimate good of all nations concerned, are determined to establish a new world order.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.120]  You think so, huh?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.761]  In a year, there will be history.
[00:55:02.301 --> 00:55:03.081]  It'll never work out.
[00:55:04.521 --> 00:55:05.842]  You give me a couple of minutes, I'll tell you why.
[00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:08.862]  To find out why is worth a couple of minutes.
[00:55:11.803 --> 00:55:12.083]  General?
[00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:18.725]  In all the countries that you and your gang have put the finger on, there are millions and millions of little guys just like me.
[00:55:19.926 --> 00:55:21.388]  Little guys who have never amounted to much.
[00:55:22.308 --> 00:55:24.931]  But all living our lives under pretty much the same pattern.
[00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:27.713]  And the pattern of our life is freedom.
[00:55:28.674 --> 00:55:29.534]  And it's in our blood.
[00:55:30.375 --> 00:55:33.918]  Giving us the kind of courage that you and your gang never dreamed of.
[00:55:34.659 --> 00:55:39.282]  And in the end, it's that pattern of freedom that's gonna make guys like you wish you had never been born.
[00:55:40.243 --> 00:55:40.964]  That's all, brother.
[00:55:43.639 --> 00:55:45.941]  I love it!
[00:55:46.721 --> 00:55:47.422]  You know, it's funny.
[00:55:48.202 --> 00:55:56.908]  Just this morning in here, one of my colleagues was showing me the DVD extras on THX 1138.
[00:55:57.008 --> 00:55:58.789]  Did you get that, Alex?
[00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:59.270]  Did it come in?
[00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:00.270]  Yes, I did.
[00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:05.774]  And it's George Lucas in the commentary talking about a New World Order doing this to people.
[00:56:06.094 --> 00:56:08.136]  For those who don't know, a New World Order is nothing new.
[00:56:08.256 --> 00:56:09.717]  Hitler called for one
[00:56:10.379 --> 00:56:19.569]  And I've even got a Disney cartoon where they're dancing around acting stupid, Disney characters dressed up like Nazis calling for a new world order.
[00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:25.094]  But hey, do me a favor, will you dub me a copy of that, dupe me a copy of that and send it to me?
[00:56:25.134 --> 00:56:28.938]  Go to a video store and get the movie China with Alan Ladd and William Bendix.
[00:56:29.279 --> 00:56:30.480]  You should be able to pick it up there.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.482]  But that speech Alan Ladd gives
[00:56:33.007 --> 00:56:35.149]  Means just as much today as it did back then.
[00:56:35.209 --> 00:56:37.591]  I know, but what I'm telling you is, sir, we're really busy.
[00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:41.374]  If you want to help us, you could make me a copy of that and mail it to me.
[00:56:41.574 --> 00:56:43.396]  I'll send it to you, Alex.
[00:56:43.636 --> 00:56:44.457]  That would be fabulous.
[00:56:44.477 --> 00:56:47.860]  I mean, I hate to ask for stuff, it's just... That's fine.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:48.700]  I'll do it.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.585]  There's a better chance of that ending up on the air as a bumper or something if you send it to me.
[00:56:53.985 --> 00:56:54.585]  I'll send it to you.
[00:56:56.127 --> 00:56:56.407]  Okay.
[00:56:56.547 --> 00:56:57.448]  What else is on your mind?
[00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:05.619]  Well, one other quick thing, I've read in a paper that the Chinese, they wanted it to rain over Beijing, so they fired some rockets up in the air and they caused it to rain.
[00:57:05.779 --> 00:57:10.461]  Yeah, that was Associated Press, but it's a conspiracy theory that we can control the weather.
[00:57:10.521 --> 00:57:11.402]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:11.842 --> 00:57:23.148]  I've just had the father of weather weapons on, the meteorologist, the physicist, Ben Livingston, and they, in the 1960s, destroyed hurricanes.
[00:57:23.768 --> 00:57:24.208]  Beat them.
[00:57:24.308 --> 00:57:24.408]  It's 100%.
[00:57:26.087 --> 00:57:31.311]  Stanford Research Laboratories certified their research, the Navy and Air Force's research.
[00:57:31.672 --> 00:57:33.333]  No debating it, they can stop hurricanes.
[00:57:33.613 --> 00:57:34.114]  And they don't.
[00:57:35.094 --> 00:57:35.935]  No debating it.
[00:57:36.656 --> 00:57:38.277]  Let's talk to Leslie in Virginia.
[00:57:38.297 --> 00:57:38.997]  Leslie, go ahead.
[00:57:39.298 --> 00:57:41.099]  Hi Alex, I really enjoyed that clip.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.080]  I did too.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:51.327]  I just want to say, on that Fourth Amendment, I want to thank you, and I have a question for you, for exposing the question and answer theory to General Hayden.
[00:57:52.448 --> 00:57:55.351]  The American people need to know, and Congress,
[00:57:56.484 --> 00:58:01.347]  Because President Bush said this was the best guy for the job.
[00:58:01.807 --> 00:58:05.569]  My question is this to you, Alex, and you probably have the answer.
[00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:13.854]  As you know, Tony Snow is a member of the Foreign Council and he just worked for Fox and was just given the job over the White House.
[00:58:14.755 --> 00:58:18.637]  How long, if he's been a member of the Foreign Council, General Hayden?
[00:58:20.822 --> 00:58:22.502]  You mean Council on Foreign Relations?
[00:58:22.642 --> 00:58:24.763]  I'm sorry, Foreign Relations.
[00:58:24.863 --> 00:58:25.323]  I'm sorry.
[00:58:25.743 --> 00:58:26.003]  Correct.
[00:58:26.463 --> 00:58:35.365]  I mean, I don't have the list for the membership years in front of me, but anybody who's in a position of power at that level is Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:58:35.825 --> 00:58:36.565]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:36.605 --> 00:58:37.065]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.466 --> 00:58:45.046]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:56.906 --> 00:58:57.567]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.227 --> 00:58:59.268]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.988 --> 00:59:01.109]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:02.570]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:04.251]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.892 --> 00:59:08.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.075 --> 00:59:13.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.082 --> 00:59:22.044]  Now already into hour number two.
[00:59:22.104 --> 00:59:24.006]  Wow, that first hour flew past us.
[00:59:24.716 --> 00:59:38.506]  We'll talk more about the controversy with Hayden, and of course, why Goss stood down, resigned Friday, because he was at parties trafficked by payoffs, high-priced hookers, and gambling.
[00:59:39.446 --> 00:59:41.128]  And that is mainstream news.
[00:59:41.148 --> 00:59:42.949]  The question is, was he involved?
[00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:52.556]  Look, frankly, that is nothing compared to just the trillions missing from the Pentagon and the run-of-the-mill corruption that no one ever seems to want to focus in on.
[00:59:53.416 --> 00:59:54.197]  But it is serious.
[00:59:55.174 --> 01:00:01.439]  And we've got Michael Berger, one of the 9-11 Truth Organizers, coming on to talk about some really exciting 9-11 information with you.
[01:00:01.479 --> 01:00:03.161]  And we'll continue with your calls this hour.
[01:00:04.061 --> 01:00:07.224]  More info on Iran and their oil bores saying they're going to dump the dollar.
[01:00:07.324 --> 01:00:08.285]  Very, very serious.
[01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.907]  Now that's finally in the Associated Press of all places.
[01:00:11.367 --> 01:00:14.170]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Virginia.
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:14.950]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:23.077]  Yes, over the weekend, Alex, Marsha Mercer, who is Washington Bureau Chief for Media General, had a partly good calm
[01:00:23.727 --> 01:00:29.348]  On this grandiose memorial that they are planning in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[01:00:29.748 --> 01:00:33.889]  She went out there and... By the way, it's a crescent moon.
[01:00:33.949 --> 01:00:34.929]  It's Muslim.
[01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:37.590]  Yeah, of course.
[01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:42.131]  Now, her column, of course, didn't say that the whole thing was Freudian.
[01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:53.193]  But the thing is, this bill has been discussed by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior Enforcement and Environment and Related Agencies.
[01:00:53.766 --> 01:00:53.966]  I'm good.
[01:01:11.075 --> 01:01:14.056]  Well, of course, if they said 60 million, it would be 100 million.
[01:01:14.136 --> 01:01:16.996]  You're going to spend over a billion on the New York Memorial.
[01:01:17.857 --> 01:01:21.998]  Right, and now this memorial is 1,900 acres, which is three times the size of Arlington Cemetery, and even Mercer
[01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:54.561]  To her credit, this is grandiose, and it's not appropriate, but the point is that... Well, for those that don't know, it's very fascistic to have these huge monuments, and at the same time, it's a monument to a fraud, because what we've been told about Flight 93 is a lie, but I mean, sir, if you're upset about
[01:01:55.433 --> 01:01:56.254]  Sixty million?
[01:01:56.294 --> 01:01:59.998]  I mean, that's nothing compared to the other corruption going on in government.
[01:02:00.379 --> 01:02:04.243]  I mean, $6.1 billion for Bush's new Marine One chopper?
[01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:11.331]  I think this is a terrific development that we can clue on because it brings
[01:02:12.225 --> 01:02:17.548]  It brings 9-1-1 into the present, because this is a bill that we can argue against.
[01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:18.208]  I understand.
[01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:24.811]  Are they still... And it has not been taken up by the full House Appropriations Committee.
[01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:26.712]  Is the memorial still a crescent moon?
[01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:33.355]  She doesn't say what the shape of it is.
[01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:37.057]  A few weeks ago I saw an article, a big controversy for a few months.
[01:02:37.437 --> 01:02:38.978]  It's a huge crescent moon.
[01:02:38.998 --> 01:02:39.638]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:40.296 --> 01:02:43.037]  And then there's other parts of the memorial that even look like the stars.
[01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:46.198]  So it's actually, it's like a sick joke on us or something.
[01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:48.238]  Oh, the globalists just never end.
[01:02:48.278 --> 01:02:49.659]  These people are just so wild.
[01:02:50.439 --> 01:02:51.299]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:02:51.339 --> 01:02:53.540]  I mean, I'm not saying it isn't important.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.841]  I'm just saying if you're upset about 60 million, but I get your point.
[01:02:57.861 --> 01:03:02.382]  You're saying it's a way to call Congress and say, Flight 93, the official story is a lie.
[01:03:02.902 --> 01:03:04.303]  You know, we don't want this monument.
[01:03:05.423 --> 01:03:07.604]  There's nothing wrong with a monument for those that died.
[01:03:07.624 --> 01:03:08.944]  It's just tell the truth.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.902]  But see, they give us these Hollywood scripts we love.
[01:03:12.323 --> 01:03:13.624]  Let's roll!
[01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:24.174]  When the state police and others saw that plane get blown up in tens of thousands of feet in the air with a 8 plus mile, with an 8.4 mile debris fill.
[01:03:24.214 --> 01:03:26.376]  Let me give you a clue, for those that don't know.
[01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:35.020]  If a plane crashes and is driven into the ground, you're not going to have a debris field over maybe 500 yards.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.661]  I wouldn't research this.
[01:03:36.801 --> 01:03:39.843]  Record debris fields are not even near 500 yards.
[01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:45.267]  But let's just be grandiose and say 500 yards.
[01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:46.228]  8.4 miles?
[01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:48.650]  We'll be right back with Michael Berger.
[01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:49.190]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.314 --> 01:03:54.935]  What really happened September 11th?
[01:03:55.115 --> 01:03:56.196]  And who stands to gain?
[01:03:56.895 --> 01:03:58.196]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:58.396 --> 01:04:04.139]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:04.419 --> 01:04:09.662]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:09.962 --> 01:04:14.064]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:18.068]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:22.954]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.054 --> 01:04:25.817]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:04:26.117 --> 01:04:29.301]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:31.183]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:07.837]  We're good to go.
[01:06:29.535 --> 01:06:30.376]  We're good to go.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.700]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.401]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:01.221]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:01.881 --> 01:07:02.702]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.462 --> 01:07:04.342]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.023 --> 01:07:08.624]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.204 --> 01:07:13.286]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.887 --> 01:07:29.939]  Alright, my friends.
[01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:31.860]  We'll continue with open phones this hour.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.862]  We'll get into the upcoming Iran war.
[01:07:33.942 --> 01:07:36.044]  They're moving out of the dollar to the oil borscht.
[01:07:36.124 --> 01:07:37.165]  It's actually happening.
[01:07:37.205 --> 01:07:39.927]  Trading for oil in Euros.
[01:07:40.862 --> 01:07:42.483]  That's the only thing holding the dollar up.
[01:07:42.503 --> 01:08:00.719]  They've inflated it massively, but they've tied it to a real asset, a real commodity, being crude oil, so we'll be talking about that very serious development more on this new CIA director Bush is nominating, Hayden, who of course is the master of the spying on the American people.
[01:08:01.846 --> 01:08:14.113]  For the rest of the hour, we're joined by Michael Berger, and of course you may have seen him on CNN, the first CNN piece they did about Charlie Sheen when that all first broke on Showbiz tonight.
[01:08:14.713 --> 01:08:23.398]  And Michael is with 911truth.org putting on a big 9-11 symposium that's going to be great, that I'm going to be attending, up in Chicago.
[01:08:24.098 --> 01:08:27.340]  And so that is coming up the second, third, and fourth.
[01:08:28.298 --> 01:08:37.821]  There in Chicago, and we'll tell you about those websites in more detail, but he's here to talk to us about a film he's busily producing that's almost completed, The Collapse of the Buildings.
[01:08:37.861 --> 01:08:42.822]  He's here to talk to us about his views on where the 9-11 truth movement is going.
[01:08:42.882 --> 01:08:44.283]  Michael, good to have you here with us.
[01:08:44.763 --> 01:08:46.043]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:08:46.083 --> 01:08:47.004]  I really appreciate it.
[01:08:47.164 --> 01:08:47.604]  You bet.
[01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:54.726]  Just for those that don't know who you are, tell us about yourself and tell us how you woke up to 9-11 and how you've been involved and what you've been doing.
[01:08:55.803 --> 01:08:58.125]  Well, I'm just an average guy.
[01:08:58.145 --> 01:09:01.007]  I grew up in New York and moved to St.
[01:09:01.027 --> 01:09:04.370]  Louis about 22 years ago, and I still have family in New York.
[01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:09.815]  In fact, my cousin was walking his dog in lower Manhattan when the first plane went over his head.
[01:09:10.455 --> 01:09:23.226]  And I think like a lot of people, at least for me, I didn't question 9-11 until about a year and a half later when I read about the put options that were purchased on United, American,
[01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:24.747]  We're good to go.
[01:09:43.856 --> 01:09:50.778]  Where I did some more interviews with some of the recovery workers and firefighters and journalists in New York.
[01:09:51.459 --> 01:09:58.681]  So I've been going back and forth to New York now over the last three years and meeting with people and digging for the truth.
[01:09:59.181 --> 01:10:03.283]  Well that's a good place to start is you've gone right to the sources.
[01:10:03.383 --> 01:10:08.964]  Not just video clips off the news that day where firemen and police are saying, did you see the bombs go off?
[01:10:09.525 --> 01:10:10.465]  You've actually gone
[01:10:11.323 --> 01:10:17.088]  To interview them yourself and get what they're saying years later, which I think is even more powerful.
[01:10:17.128 --> 01:10:18.148]  So let's talk about that.
[01:10:18.188 --> 01:10:19.609]  Let's get into the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.672]  But first off, tell us about the Chicago event that's coming up.
[01:10:23.012 --> 01:10:23.292]  Sure.
[01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:35.702]  Well, 9-11 Truth and the Muslim-Jewish-Christian Alliance for 9-11 Truth is a co-sponsor of an upcoming conference entitled 9-11, Revealing the Truth, Reclaiming Our Future.
[01:10:36.537 --> 01:10:44.103]  And it's an education and strategy conference June 2nd through 4th at the Embassy Suite Chicago O'Hare in Rosemont, Illinois.
[01:10:44.904 --> 01:10:59.755]  And you are going to be a keynote speaker along with Stephen E. Jones, William Pepper, and in fact later this afternoon we will be putting up a new webpage for the conference which is www.911revealingthetruth.org
[01:11:01.316 --> 01:11:08.938]  And we will be announcing who the additional keynote speaker is and put up quite a bit more information about the conference itself.
[01:11:09.038 --> 01:11:21.281]  So if people are interested in learning about what we will be doing and what you will be speaking about at the conference, they can go to that webpage and again it's 911revealingthetruth.org.
[01:11:21.421 --> 01:11:27.403]  Well you can also just go to 911truth.org and there's links through to that longer domain and people missed it.
[01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:27.983]  Sure.
[01:11:28.755 --> 01:11:36.978]  And up on Infowars.com right now under the guest section, in related information, we have a link over there as well.
[01:11:37.018 --> 01:11:41.099]  And if you missed it, we'll plug it again before Mr. Berger leaves us.
[01:11:41.519 --> 01:11:52.763]  And I know we got loaded phones, your calls are coming up, but I want to continue getting into 9-11 because it's this foundational event on which this entire new police state society and this new imperialism
[01:11:54.844 --> 01:12:06.329]  Michael Berger, you've gone and you've interviewed structural engineers, you've interviewed some of the underwriters, you've interviewed Kevin Ryan, now for the first time, who was with Underwriter Laboratories.
[01:12:06.749 --> 01:12:12.632]  Let's get into what the structural engineers are saying, and physicists and others.
[01:12:12.672 --> 01:12:16.754]  Then let's get into what the firefighters and others have said, because you were instrumental
[01:12:17.543 --> 01:12:36.735]  In getting some of those firefighters to go public and talk to the, what was it, the Philadelphia Daily News and others, what about a year ago, exposing the fact that they found three of the black boxes, really the orange boxes, and that the FBI was there and had them thrown on four-wheelers and driven out, and the FBI said they didn't find them.
[01:12:37.015 --> 01:12:47.101]  So let's go through the physicists, the engineers, the underwriters, and then let's get into some of the eyewitnesses and some of the things you've gotten on videotape with this upcoming film.
[01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:47.861]  Sure.
[01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:59.626]  Well, you had mentioned the film website is improbablecollapse.com, which is about the puzzling collapse of the World Trade Centers and Tower 7.
[01:13:00.086 --> 01:13:01.227]  Where would you like to begin, Alex?
[01:13:02.575 --> 01:13:05.957]  Let's start with Stephen E. Jones and Kevin Ryan.
[01:13:06.597 --> 01:13:06.678]  Hi.
[01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:17.664]  Last year I was able to interview Stephen Jones basically before he had stopped doing public interviews after the MSNBC Tucker Carlson interview.
[01:13:18.505 --> 01:13:25.829]  And we did a one-on-one interview where we had discussed this is pretty close to the time where he first published his paper.
[01:13:26.605 --> 01:13:31.309]  And since then he's added quite a bit more to his paper and his research.
[01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:41.679]  And some of the main points that Professor Jones focused on, which I think, not that they were ignored before that, but he really brought them out and focused on them.
[01:13:42.099 --> 01:13:46.824]  For example, in New York was, what would be a possible explanation for having
[01:13:47.564 --> 01:13:48.585]  We're good to go.
[01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:14.019]  So one of the questions he raises is a possible alternative hypothesis to the official story, which, you know, says that the planes and the jet fuel fires weakened the steel and caused these collapses, and yet planes had not hit Building 7.
[01:14:14.779 --> 01:14:17.240]  So how do you explain that collapse and the government's
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:25.966]  You know, even in the official government report on Building 7, it mentions, oh, there was only really a low probability that fire brought down the building.
[01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:33.851]  So even, even I believe that was in the FEMA report, their conclusion was it was a very low probability for that building to collapse from fires alone.
[01:14:34.491 --> 01:14:37.113]  And Building 7 did have large fires.
[01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:38.854]  I interviewed several firefighters.
[01:14:39.315 --> 01:14:46.800]  I interviewed Mark Jacobson of New York Magazine on this most recent trip, who said he, they were, they were all eyewitnesses to the collapse of 7.
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:15:00.210]  And they were actually on the south side of the building, from which we really have no pictures, to see the damage in the aftermath of the collapse of the North Tower, which damaged Building 7.
[01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:11.640]  But one of the firefighters who was there, who I had met with, said to me, you know, I asked him, what were some of the strange things that you experienced in doing, you know, on that day and afterward?
[01:15:12.521 --> 01:15:22.505]  And he said, well, you know, I was down there after the collapse of the towers and looking at 7 and he said, you know, there were big fires in 7 and the building was damaged.
[01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:26.987]  But the collapse of that building was pretty inexplicable.
[01:15:27.167 --> 01:15:30.369]  Now this is from a 20 plus year veteran of the fire department.
[01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:34.492]  And Mark Jacobson as well was there when 7 came down.
[01:15:34.912 --> 01:15:45.318]  And both of these men told me independently that they were told by various people around the site at the time, you know, that building there is going to come down either later today or tomorrow.
[01:15:45.998 --> 01:15:51.001]  And I think both of them were puzzled by why people were stating.
[01:15:51.141 --> 01:15:52.502]  I don't want to just glaze over that.
[01:15:52.562 --> 01:15:58.025]  Rudolph Giuliani told ABC News Peter Jennings, God rest his soul, he also told
[01:15:59.284 --> 01:16:02.866]  The Commission, and they hide this stuff in plain view, in plain sight.
[01:16:03.566 --> 01:16:08.668]  He came right out and admitted he was told that day before the fires even started, get out of building 7.
[01:16:09.108 --> 01:16:13.450]  And they had moved the main command center out the day before for tripod 2.
[01:16:14.011 --> 01:16:19.493]  They then tried to deny that, then had to admit they'd been lying and that they had truly already pulled out.
[01:16:20.157 --> 01:16:31.379]  Yeah, I mean, you know, as you obviously, you know, once you look at 9-11 and you begin to pull on a string, the string just keeps coming and the whole fabric of your reality just appears to dissipate.
[01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:43.342]  So yeah, as you look and you question, you find there are so many different stories here that once you focus on one particular aspect of it, the story just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:46.582]  At every point, the official story is a manufactured fraud.
[01:16:47.282 --> 01:16:49.903]  Certainly would look, certainly looks like that, doesn't it?
[01:16:51.022 --> 01:16:51.382]  It does.
[01:16:51.462 --> 01:16:54.725]  Well, you know, I can't wait to see your Improbable Collapse video.
[01:16:54.785 --> 01:16:56.206]  I'm probably going to end up carrying it.
[01:16:56.786 --> 01:16:59.008]  And I know you've got several other films you're working on.
[01:16:59.028 --> 01:17:00.069]  This is really exciting.
[01:17:00.129 --> 01:17:03.491]  Are you going to be screening any of those in Chicago or showing any clips?
[01:17:03.511 --> 01:17:05.192]  Yeah, we're going to be scrum.
[01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:07.654]  I'm hoping that we're going to screen Improbable Collapse.
[01:17:08.115 --> 01:17:10.877]  I don't think we're going to screen an awful lot of films.
[01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:15.640]  We haven't decided yet how much time, because we really want people to participate in the conference.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.902]  Because the conference, you know,
[01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:35.148]  It's going to set itself apart from some of the prior conferences on 9-11 in that I think at this point in time, after four and a half years after 9-11, we really do have a great deal of research and evidence that really contradicts the official story.
[01:17:35.468 --> 01:17:36.049]  No, you're right.
[01:17:36.369 --> 01:17:39.453]  Now, I've seen outtakes in some of the clips of your film.
[01:17:39.513 --> 01:17:40.454]  It looks pretty good to me.
[01:17:41.094 --> 01:17:49.925]  You need to get me a copy to review it as soon as possible because there's a sneaking suspicion that I might want to play that in LA.
[01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:51.567]  How long is your film?
[01:17:52.188 --> 01:17:53.570]  It's going to be about an hour and 45.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.380]  We may have time to play that.
[01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:56.861]  I'm not sure.
[01:17:57.121 --> 01:18:00.262]  We're going to be screening several others, but we'll see what happens.
[01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.003]  We've got a break here in just a moment.
[01:18:02.023 --> 01:18:04.243]  When we come back, I want to get into Kevin Ryan.
[01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:09.685]  I mean, this is the guy who worked for Endowriter Laboratories, and they did their own internal test and said, this is a joke.
[01:18:09.725 --> 01:18:11.806]  This is ridiculous.
[01:18:11.846 --> 01:18:15.187]  And then he got canned shortly after he went public.
[01:18:15.227 --> 01:18:21.950]  So there's all these people out there going, engineers, you know, would be going public, or structural engineers would be
[01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:24.670]  Going public, if this was the case.
[01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:26.551]  This is the case.
[01:18:27.071 --> 01:18:31.213]  And I also want to talk about those black boxes and a lot more with Michael Berger, our guest.
[01:18:31.253 --> 01:18:32.553]  He's with 911truth.org.
[01:18:33.094 --> 01:18:36.615]  You can link through at infowares.com and go to the Chicago event coming up the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
[01:18:36.995 --> 01:18:38.576]  And I'll be there on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
[01:18:38.596 --> 01:18:43.258]  And then, of course, I've got my big event coming up in June, the 24th and 25th.
[01:18:43.538 --> 01:18:45.259]  We've already sold 10% of the tickets.
[01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:46.580]  Only 3 days of ticket sales.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.000]  10% are gone.
[01:18:48.081 --> 01:18:48.841]  Get yours now!
[01:18:52.648 --> 01:18:54.628]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[01:18:54.788 --> 01:18:55.128]  Thanks.
[01:18:55.388 --> 01:18:57.629]  Last summer I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[01:18:57.749 --> 01:18:59.769]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[01:18:59.889 --> 01:19:01.269]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[01:19:01.329 --> 01:19:02.270]  See, this one looks thick.
[01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:03.170]  That one's yellow.
[01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:05.110]  What you need is Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:08.391]  Non-X clears out the build-up that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[01:19:08.651 --> 01:19:09.811]  It's called Keratin Debris.
[01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:11.211]  Just apply Non-X daily.
[01:19:11.291 --> 01:19:13.352]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[01:19:13.572 --> 01:19:14.392]  Just look at mine.
[01:19:14.552 --> 01:19:16.992]  The dietrist recommended Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:17.172 --> 01:19:22.033]  Now at Walgreens, Long's, Eckerd Pharmacy, Rite Aid, and Brooks Pharmacy in the foot care section.
[01:19:23.979 --> 01:19:25.020]  Looking for profits?
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.440]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.642]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:19:30.042 --> 01:19:37.306]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:41.248]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:42.949]  Secure your position today.
[01:19:43.249 --> 01:19:44.389]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:44.750]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:52.796 --> 01:19:53.777]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:53.857 --> 01:19:58.640]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:06.605]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:06.865 --> 01:20:12.249]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.449 --> 01:20:19.434]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:25.060]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:30.045]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.386 --> 01:20:37.994]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:44.585]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:44.885 --> 01:20:45.947]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:46.168]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.202 --> 01:20:55.464]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:55.524 --> 01:20:59.707]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:59.967 --> 01:21:02.749]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:02.949 --> 01:21:05.351]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:05.531 --> 01:21:14.176]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:14.376 --> 01:21:15.717]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:20.060]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.181]  We're good to go!
[01:21:39.403 --> 01:21:39.984]  We're good to go.
[01:21:52.936 --> 01:21:55.459]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:04.071]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a sting indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[01:22:04.872 --> 01:22:09.839]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[01:22:10.578 --> 01:22:18.006]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[01:22:18.846 --> 01:22:22.610]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[01:22:23.431 --> 01:22:26.654]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[01:22:27.635 --> 01:22:32.058]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:34.160]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:34.560]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:35.021]  Call now.
[01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:38.043]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:22:52.769 --> 01:22:58.451]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.673 --> 01:23:05.294]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:05.334 --> 01:23:21.740]  Michael Berger is our guest, and I believe he's going to be at our event as well, so that'll be exciting, coming up in June, but he's got an event coming up, sponsored by several great organizations, in Chicago early next month, in early June.
[01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:28.221]  Continuing, let's get into the Underwriter Laboratories and Kevin Ryan.
[01:23:28.261 --> 01:23:29.684]  You now have gotten him to talk.
[01:23:29.984 --> 01:23:31.247]  You're going to have him at your event.
[01:23:31.647 --> 01:23:34.112]  And you've also interviewed him on videotape, Michael.
[01:23:34.981 --> 01:23:37.943]  Yeah, Kevin's a really great guy.
[01:23:37.963 --> 01:23:48.629]  He was gracious enough at the last moment to grant an interview with me, as we've already been in post-production on the film and announced the release.
[01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:57.635]  I took a shot, and since he was coming to the conference, I asked him if I could possibly meet him because I was going to go to interview Gwen Corbett from John Jay College.
[01:23:58.383 --> 01:24:09.913]  And because I want to present a balanced view of the demolition of the towers, or the hypothesis about the demolition, and present the information so that viewers can make up their own mind about what happened there.
[01:24:10.473 --> 01:24:16.719]  And so Kevin was gracious enough to grant a last minute interview just three days before I was coming out there.
[01:24:17.459 --> 01:24:20.020]  And he's just a great guy.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:36.186]  Here's a whistleblower who's a concerned citizen who worked for Underwriters Laboratories and had basically written to the CEO of the organization and was concerned that the reputation of Underwriters Laboratory was on the line because they had done testing on the steel.
[01:24:37.367 --> 01:24:41.028]  And once that was made public, he got fired.
[01:24:43.192 --> 01:24:44.114]  A lot of courage.
[01:24:44.574 --> 01:24:46.277]  You met with him in person.
[01:24:46.297 --> 01:24:51.164]  A pretty circumscript, pretty serious person, you said.
[01:24:51.184 --> 01:24:53.147]  Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[01:24:53.187 --> 01:24:53.968]  I think he is.
[01:24:54.128 --> 01:24:54.809]  He is...
[01:24:56.125 --> 01:25:14.372]  I think maybe even uncomfortable with how quickly this, you know, with the speed of communication nowadays with the internet, how quickly that letter and the result of being fired for effectively whistleblowing, how quickly that put him in the spotlight.
[01:25:15.392 --> 01:25:24.456]  Now they did test, they tested the steel in temperatures and his letter, his research conclusively showed that
[01:25:25.592 --> 01:25:28.835]  Well, you know, the testing on the steel was that the steel used in the towers were
[01:25:40.473 --> 01:25:53.567]  ...subjected to fires and furnaces in labs for two hours at temperatures that were higher than those that were reached in the towers, and the steel withstood the test easily, and that was what Ryan had learned about.
[01:25:53.987 --> 01:26:02.997]  And so that raised serious questions about the collapse hypothesis that NIST had put out, and when he raised this concern, he was fired.
[01:26:03.903 --> 01:26:09.051]  In fact, you can read about it with links to what he had written on the website for the film.
[01:26:09.111 --> 01:26:12.757]  The background for the film is now up at improbablecollapse.com.
[01:26:13.558 --> 01:26:17.423]  You can read background information about the film and the people who were in the film.
[01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:19.647]  There are links to what they've written and what they've said.
[01:26:19.887 --> 01:26:20.747]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:26:20.787 --> 01:26:29.609]  Let's shift gears now into, you were instrumental in getting some of the volunteer firefighters and rescuers who recovered some of the boxes, getting them to go public.
[01:26:29.649 --> 01:26:33.870]  And most Americans still aren't even aware of this, even though it's admitted in the mainstream news.
[01:26:34.631 --> 01:26:38.812]  Yeah, in fact, how that came about was there was a self-published book.
[01:26:38.872 --> 01:26:48.474]  It was just first-person stories that different rescue and recovery guys, firefighters, steel workers who did recoveries at the site,
[01:26:49.134 --> 01:26:53.776]  And basically went down there, risked their lives to help in any way that they could.
[01:26:54.216 --> 01:27:13.822]  One of the interesting common threads throughout meeting with these different men and women who volunteered down there was there, it's really interesting that for whatever reason, as everyone else in Manhattan Island was running to get away, these men and women for some reason were pulled to run there and help.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:24.683]  And really, really contribute in any way they could to trying to assist in finding people or in doing recoveries afterward.
[01:27:25.523 --> 01:27:41.848]  And in this self-published book, there was a small paragraph in which one of the firefighters had stated that at one time he was assigned by a chief to take around some federal agents in an APV with their recovery equipment to locate the beacon signals from the black boxes, which as you stated are actually orange.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:56.839]  And they located three out of the four, and the curious thing about this, this book was published in 2003 before the final commission report, and yet in the final commission report it states in a footnote that the boxes were never located.
[01:27:56.859 --> 01:28:00.704]  It doesn't even say that they weren't recovered, it says they weren't even located.
[01:28:01.244 --> 01:28:05.706]  And that is directly contradicted by this statement, which was in the public domain.
[01:28:06.086 --> 01:28:08.167]  These men were never asked to come testify.
[01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:18.350]  And then just, I believe it was last December, Dave Lindorf wrote an article for Counterpunch, in which he had interviewed an anonymous NTSB official.
[01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:25.133]  So we have a second confirmation now that he examined the black boxes and that the FBI took them.
[01:28:25.752 --> 01:28:28.054]  All right, we're going to be right back with Michael Berger.
[01:28:28.114 --> 01:28:28.935]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:29.295 --> 01:28:30.215]  We'll take your calls.
[01:28:30.275 --> 01:28:32.037]  I'm sure they'll be all over the map, but that's okay.
[01:28:32.397 --> 01:28:37.901]  Specifically, if you want to talk about 9-11, toll-free number 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:42.044]  My websites are jonesreport.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:43.806]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.286 --> 01:28:45.887]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.808 --> 01:28:49.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.368 --> 01:29:00.250]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:13.294]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:15.094]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:15.454 --> 01:29:18.916]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:19.196 --> 01:29:22.978]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:28.201]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be that special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:28.461 --> 01:29:30.162]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:30.882]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.143 --> 01:30:00.669]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:11.859]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.119 --> 01:30:13.922]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.202 --> 01:30:17.527]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:17.847 --> 01:30:28.302]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.602 --> 01:30:29.102]  That's right!
[01:30:29.282 --> 01:30:36.384]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.684 --> 01:30:40.805]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:30:40.965 --> 01:30:45.106]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.126 --> 01:30:45.646]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.468 --> 01:30:57.510]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:57.730 --> 01:31:01.131]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.312 --> 01:31:04.713]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[01:31:05.057 --> 01:31:08.279]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.319 --> 01:31:13.781]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:13.821 --> 01:31:23.446]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.586 --> 01:31:24.926]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:24.966 --> 01:31:30.369]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.849 --> 01:31:35.314]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.374 --> 01:31:36.755]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.915 --> 01:31:40.739]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.839 --> 01:31:41.660]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:32:00.678 --> 01:32:05.080]  Before we go back to our guest Michael Berger and your calls,
[01:32:18.712 --> 01:32:21.853]  I want to encourage all listeners to support us and what we're doing.
[01:32:21.893 --> 01:32:26.615]  To go to Infowars.com, the secure online shopping cart for the video and bookstore.
[01:32:27.096 --> 01:32:29.957]  We have pro-Second Amendment t-shirts that George Bush would call liberal.
[01:32:30.257 --> 01:32:32.178]  Again, if you're really a conservative today, you're called a liberal.
[01:32:32.838 --> 01:32:36.720]  We have books on tape, books, videos, documentaries by other researchers.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:38.440]  We're adding new items all the time.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.161]  If you haven't checked it out lately, go there.
[01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:43.562]  Just so many great films that are available.
[01:32:43.602 --> 01:32:44.563]  We have the video that
[01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.510]  We're good to go.
[01:33:09.438 --> 01:33:11.320]  Being informed when it comes to politics.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.862]  I'm not trying to be patronizing.
[01:33:12.882 --> 01:33:13.543]  It's just the truth.
[01:33:14.043 --> 01:33:15.745]  So it's a great tool to wake people up.
[01:33:16.165 --> 01:33:16.926]  We have my 9-11 films.
[01:33:18.732 --> 01:33:40.016]  Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, 9-11, Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, uh... we have Webster Tarpley's book, 9-11, Synthetic Terror, Made in the USA, George Humphrey's 9-11 video, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, Loose Change, Second Edition, by...
[01:33:40.556 --> 01:33:44.820]  Dylan Avery and so many others at Infowars.com.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.161]  Sure, you know all about 9-11.
[01:33:46.181 --> 01:33:48.323]  You've heard a hundred radio interviews about it.
[01:33:48.343 --> 01:33:49.845]  You've read a thousand articles about it.
[01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.706]  You've watched the videos of the collapses.
[01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:53.528]  Your neighbors haven't.
[01:33:54.069 --> 01:33:58.613]  So get the videos I produced and make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:33:59.113 --> 01:33:59.713]  Not for sale.
[01:34:00.013 --> 01:34:01.374]  You can make copies and hand them out.
[01:34:01.474 --> 01:34:02.154]  Please do that.
[01:34:02.575 --> 01:34:03.995]  Aramon Access Television.
[01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:10.538]  I can't authorize you to make copies of the other videos I haven't produced, but you can contact them if you'd like after you get the films and ask permission.
[01:34:11.158 --> 01:34:13.199]  But the point is, get my films, make copies.
[01:34:13.259 --> 01:34:15.100]  It has such a huge effect.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.922]  And then secondarily, your purchase of the videos makes this broadcast possible.
[01:34:20.342 --> 01:34:24.948]  So please go to InfoWars.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart or call toll free.
[01:34:24.988 --> 01:34:26.290]  They can answer all your questions.
[01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:27.531]  You can order tickets.
[01:34:27.812 --> 01:34:32.418]  We'll mail you tickets if you prefer to the event in June 24th and 25th in LA.
[01:34:33.459 --> 01:34:35.181]  Whatever you like by calling 1-888.
[01:34:37.807 --> 01:34:43.069]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 that's 888-253-3139 or go to PrisonPlanet.tv where all 14 of my films are posted, my weekly TV reports,
[01:34:53.092 --> 01:35:08.468]  Weekly mini-documentaries I make, in-studio interviews, all my best audio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly subscriptions for $5.95, get a yearly subscription, you get 3 months free, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:08.608 --> 01:35:09.289]  Don't wait!
[01:35:09.469 --> 01:35:10.510]  Expose the globalists!
[01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:16.496]  By exposing them, we render them, as Michael Berg said in a conversation with me, impotent.
[01:35:17.142 --> 01:35:22.747]  By exposing the government-sponsored terror paradigm, how they've done it over and over again, which is what my films do.
[01:35:22.767 --> 01:35:24.068]  We don't just focus on 9-11.
[01:35:24.348 --> 01:35:29.052]  We focus on OKC, the First World Trade Center, Hitler in the Reichstag, Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:35:30.387 --> 01:35:36.650]  You then wake people up and so they will not go running to the government whenever there's an attack begging to have their liberties taken.
[01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:38.271]  We are saving this country.
[01:35:38.351 --> 01:35:40.051]  People are really waking up right now.
[01:35:40.351 --> 01:35:41.552]  It's very fertile ground.
[01:35:42.092 --> 01:35:45.634]  By the way, PrisonPlanet.tv is an amazing activist tool.
[01:35:45.694 --> 01:35:49.055]  You can download all my films, burn them to CD right there and distribute them.
[01:35:49.335 --> 01:35:50.416]  So again, take action.
[01:35:50.716 --> 01:35:52.937]  Going back to Michael Berger.
[01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:55.218]  Michael, we're going to go to some calls here in just a moment.
[01:35:55.658 --> 01:36:07.505]  But before we do that, one more time, plug for people the great event that you and others are organizing and tickets are selling briskly, folks, coming up June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in Chicago.
[01:36:08.085 --> 01:36:11.307]  Yeah, again, it's an education and strategy conference.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:30.997]  9-11, revealing the truth, reclaiming our future, and I do want to distinguish it from maybe previous events people may have attended in that, at this point we've, you know, as I was saying earlier, you know, we have a great deal of research from 9-11 researchers, people who've done great work in bringing out the facts and the truth about what happened.
[01:36:31.577 --> 01:36:36.979]  And we've got people from all over the political spectrum who support the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:43.222]  And we've got the Internet, so we can communicate with each other, we can join together no matter where you are.
[01:36:43.822 --> 01:36:48.164]  So, what we hope to come out of from this conference
[01:36:49.645 --> 01:37:06.516]  Yes, my speech is going to be about the history of government-sponsored terror, and the kind of the back story on the Bush and the Bin Ladens, and then I'm going to get into some of the key points of 9-11.
[01:37:19.225 --> 01:37:27.571]  Well, I mean, you know, I want to say, you know, I was really, really happy to read the title and to talk with you about what you're going to speak to about.
[01:37:27.912 --> 01:37:29.013]  How will we win?
[01:37:29.433 --> 01:37:32.055]  Because really, at this point, we have the information.
[01:37:32.075 --> 01:37:40.762]  We have, as you were saying, you know, there's a huge rising tide of people who are waking up to the truth about these type of events.
[01:37:41.448 --> 01:38:05.530]  And 9-11, the way I look at it, is it is an enormous wake-up call, and it announces the potential for a transformation in this country, that if we can wake up to the truth about 9-11 and other events that maybe people have not acknowledged publicly to each other, once they realize that it's okay to come out and talk to their neighbors, talk to their friends, and share what they really believe,
[01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:18.059]  That they are dissatisfied with the direction this country is going, that it is within our power to reclaim our future and to take back the reins of power from those who have their own interests at heart.
[01:38:18.439 --> 01:38:18.739]  I agree.
[01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:27.786]  We're about to go to calls, but I want to bring up one point of controversy because, and I believe it's a COINTELPRO disinformation program.
[01:38:27.806 --> 01:38:32.169]  I'm not going to go off on any names because that just gives these people attention, but
[01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:35.004]  I talked about 9-11 two months before it happened.
[01:38:35.044 --> 01:38:36.246]  I talked about it on the day it happened.
[01:38:36.306 --> 01:38:37.328]  I took the heat for it.
[01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:43.398]  I had people attack me verbally over it and in major publications like the Washington Post a week after 9-11.
[01:38:43.899 --> 01:38:45.361]  So I really hit the barbed wire.
[01:38:46.343 --> 01:38:51.929]  And I've noticed that so many other groups and people out there try to be orthodox about it.
[01:38:52.069 --> 01:38:53.791]  They try to claim their orthodoxy.
[01:38:54.172 --> 01:38:56.054]  Their view is the only view.
[01:38:56.134 --> 01:38:58.356]  Who they said did it is the only group.
[01:38:58.396 --> 01:39:00.138]  Don't look at anybody else's theories.
[01:39:00.759 --> 01:39:03.082]  And we have people on all sides doing this.
[01:39:03.682 --> 01:39:09.527]  And I think it's really dangerous, but I like the fact that you've got a diverse crowd coming to your event looking at different angles.
[01:39:09.587 --> 01:39:10.368]  That's what we're doing.
[01:39:10.448 --> 01:39:12.450]  I believe all debate is healthy.
[01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:14.832]  All debate is good, even if you disagree with people.
[01:39:15.152 --> 01:39:16.413]  But I want to bring up this point.
[01:39:16.453 --> 01:39:22.378]  You and I have both been criticized, I don't know if you're aware of this, for not saying that Israel carried out the attacks.
[01:39:22.419 --> 01:39:23.640]  Now, I'm sorry, folks.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:26.002]  Israel can't make NORAD stand down.
[01:39:28.783 --> 01:39:33.164]  Israel can't make the F-16s be off doing drills that day.
[01:39:34.244 --> 01:39:40.246]  Israel certainly is part of this whole global system, certainly involved in false flag ops in Israel and Europe.
[01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:41.887]  They've been caught, it's been in their major papers.
[01:39:42.267 --> 01:39:49.709]  I've reported on that, but from all the angles I've looked at this, it's this multinational crime syndicate manipulating our government
[01:39:50.089 --> 01:39:52.991]  No, I have to acknowledge what you're saying.
[01:39:53.191 --> 01:39:59.234]  I mean, you know, look, at this point for people to come out and say that X or Y, we know that they've definitively done this,
[01:40:13.763 --> 01:40:27.897]  What it does, I think, as you were pointing out, is it keeps dividing us, and one of the things the people in power want us to do is not speak to each other, not come together, not wake up and realize our power.
[01:40:27.957 --> 01:40:35.585]  It's like 50 branches of Baptist, and then somebody breaks off because they want to have their own group, and they break off because they want their own, and just on and on and on.
[01:40:35.945 --> 01:40:53.253]  Yeah, and by dividing us, basically, we are disempowered, and if, you know, hopefully, coming out of Chicago, we can come to common ground where all the different groups, as you were saying, who have their own different versions of the truth can at least acknowledge that
[01:40:54.076 --> 01:41:02.562]  The only way we can take the country back and reclaim our future is if we can overlook where we disagree and meet where we agree.
[01:41:03.043 --> 01:41:10.969]  We all acknowledge that we do not like the direction that this country is going and that the only way we can change it is to come together.
[01:41:10.989 --> 01:41:11.449]  I agree.
[01:41:11.469 --> 01:41:12.550]  Let me try to sum it up this way.
[01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:15.871]  We know the official story is a conspiracy theory.
[01:41:15.911 --> 01:41:18.132]  We know the official story is a fraud.
[01:41:18.752 --> 01:41:24.753]  All the evidence, all the motives, all the documents, all the history, and I try to disprove this premise.
[01:41:25.033 --> 01:41:26.574]  I wish this wasn't true, folks.
[01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:29.175]  When I research stuff, I try to disprove my own views.
[01:41:29.535 --> 01:41:33.656]  I don't go into this emotionally, oh, this is my opinion, so I frame the debate.
[01:41:36.079 --> 01:41:39.343]  No, my friends, there's no doubting that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:41:39.703 --> 01:41:41.025]  You cannot get around that.
[01:41:41.405 --> 01:41:44.909]  And then all the globalists can do is try to get us all fighting with each other.
[01:41:44.949 --> 01:41:50.236]  And I've been able to research it and find out that the feds really are behind trying to get us fighting with each other.
[01:41:51.084 --> 01:42:08.978]  Well, I mean, the whole issue is, I mean, even people within the 9-11 Truth Movement who maybe have a particular point of view, if their point of view isn't quote-unquote the one that we all agree to, then they also begin to push back and split the groups and split our movement.
[01:42:09.358 --> 01:42:12.180]  And the only way that we can ever
[01:42:13.396 --> 01:42:30.164]  You know, reclaim our constitutional civil liberties, bring the country back into alignment with the Constitution, end illegal wars, fix the black box voting system so our votes actually count.
[01:42:30.585 --> 01:42:34.907]  The only way we will ever do that is if we rise up together.
[01:42:35.487 --> 01:42:38.988]  Peacefully, and reclaim the power that the people have.
[01:42:39.408 --> 01:42:40.748]  How many of them are there?
[01:42:40.768 --> 01:42:40.748]  20?
[01:42:41.649 --> 01:42:44.649]  30,000?
[01:42:41.829 --> 01:42:44.649]  There are 270 plus million of us?
[01:42:44.969 --> 01:42:46.870]  It's really not a fair fight if we come together.
[01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:50.771]  I agree, and that's the key to what they do.
[01:42:50.791 --> 01:42:55.192]  And I just want to add this, and this is not my opinion, you can go research this.
[01:42:55.993 --> 01:43:06.084]  The ADL and other major organizations, their allied groups have been caught, the Feds have been caught, creating fake Klan groups.
[01:43:06.564 --> 01:43:15.273]  They have been caught creating these anti-Semitic groups to then go out on any particular issue and then to use that to go after all Americans' freedom.
[01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:16.415]  So the groups out there
[01:43:16.975 --> 01:43:22.439]  That just constantly are bashing Jews and other people.
[01:43:22.819 --> 01:43:29.263]  You only ensure that the majority of Americans will not join our movement and that the New World Order will win.
[01:43:29.544 --> 01:43:37.569]  And that's why the government, and I've caught them, in many cases are out there fostering this view, then others pick it up and parrot it, and it only helps.
[01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:44.714]  And on top of it, and on top of it, folks, I've done the research, Israel could not carry out these attacks.
[01:43:45.994 --> 01:43:47.495]  Again, I'm just saying that on the record.
[01:43:47.935 --> 01:43:49.416]  I'm trying to go after who's guilty.
[01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.977]  I'll say who I believe did it, and all the evidence shows it.
[01:43:52.337 --> 01:43:54.819]  And it's Dick Cheney, it's people above him.
[01:43:55.259 --> 01:43:59.161]  And of course, Bob Bowman has said that, former head of the Star Wars program.
[01:43:59.521 --> 01:44:01.802]  Many others have fingered him as the main suspect.
[01:44:02.522 --> 01:44:07.625]  And so, it is a scapegoat to say, and again, Michael, you don't even get into this stuff.
[01:44:07.725 --> 01:44:10.406]  I just brought it up because I'm sick of it.
[01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:13.007]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:44:13.027 --> 01:44:14.327]  I'm going to run through these quick.
[01:44:14.367 --> 01:44:15.968]  Peter in New York, you're on the air.
[01:44:16.248 --> 01:44:16.508]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:16.528 --> 01:44:21.289]  I'm sorry, I was just talking to the meter reader here that was at the door.
[01:44:21.309 --> 01:44:22.110]  I just turned them on your show.
[01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:31.893]  There's so many things that I'd just love to talk to you for literally probably thousands of hours if you're ever in Buffalo.
[01:44:32.873 --> 01:44:36.434]  Stay at my house if you want.
[01:44:36.774 --> 01:44:38.295]  Take my name number off the air if you want.
[01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:52.891]  I've often thought that maybe if there were one... You know, people like me, I like to tell people things that I hear, like on your show and other places.
[01:44:53.311 --> 01:45:04.379]  But is there one, say, paper or book that you could point to that would be like a main selling point, so to speak?
[01:45:05.646 --> 01:45:10.569]  To turn people on to all these shenanigans that are being played out?
[01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:13.130]  Well, I mean, I get this question a lot.
[01:45:13.231 --> 01:45:15.812]  What is one Bible or manifesto?
[01:45:16.472 --> 01:45:19.834]  And I think that would be the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[01:45:19.954 --> 01:45:28.719]  Read that, then learn what the phrases mean, research it, and then compare that to the society we now live in today.
[01:45:29.159 --> 01:45:33.722]  And it's becoming so alien to how this country was set up and what the framers did.
[01:45:34.202 --> 01:45:37.806]  And obviously, I think my films are the best because we give you wide spectrum info.
[01:45:37.826 --> 01:45:45.094]  We don't just focus on one issue, which I think is also good to do, but we focus on a wide spectrum to try to give you a view of that.
[01:45:45.494 --> 01:45:46.776]  Michael Berger, you got any comments?
[01:45:47.456 --> 01:45:52.161]  Yeah, I mean, I think what you're saying, Alex, is exactly right.
[01:45:54.053 --> 01:46:16.269]  The ideals put forth for the foundation of our form of government were ideals to be lived up to, and it's up to us to live up to those, and that means we have to engage in political action, we have to speak with our neighbors and friends, we have to create community, and part of this is, you know, if you do this work, you know, you value truth.
[01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:21.373]  That is a guiding principle or value that you hold, you know,
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:22.200]  Absolutely.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.462]  I mean, so much of defeating tyranny is not even getting it all right.
[01:46:24.482 --> 01:46:26.964]  It's just standing up and putting one foot in front of the other.
[01:46:39.535 --> 01:46:43.696]  So many people never take action because they think, well, I wouldn't do a perfect job or I wouldn't know what to do.
[01:46:44.016 --> 01:46:48.317]  Hey, just getting in the game and knowing who your enemy is, you'll win the battle.
[01:46:48.757 --> 01:46:50.157]  I've got to move on here.
[01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:52.277]  I really do appreciate your call, Peter.
[01:46:52.297 --> 01:46:58.219]  Sorry you had to hold so long, and I don't think I'll be up in Buffalo anytime soon, but thank you for the nice offer.
[01:46:58.239 --> 01:46:59.259]  Why don't you come out to L.A.
[01:46:59.299 --> 01:47:00.519]  We'll meet you or come out to Chicago.
[01:47:00.979 --> 01:47:03.580]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.240]  You're on the air, John, go ahead.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:08.282]  Yes, I'm just an ordinary guy like your guest.
[01:47:08.862 --> 01:47:14.666]  I don't belong to any organizations, but I have perused some groups like WSWS.org.
[01:47:14.706 --> 01:47:17.348]  Yes, be sure and plug the communist websites every time you come on.
[01:47:17.728 --> 01:47:19.629]  And workers org.
[01:47:19.749 --> 01:47:21.610]  Which you do every time you call, John.
[01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:22.211]  Fine, go ahead.
[01:47:22.411 --> 01:47:23.472]  I think it's necessary.
[01:47:23.752 --> 01:47:24.652]  You're absolutely right.
[01:47:25.013 --> 01:47:30.076]  My disagreement with you is totally opposite of that COINTELPRO original caller.
[01:47:30.898 --> 01:47:34.561]  I agree with everything you're saying about 9-11, the police state, and the rest of it.
[01:47:34.601 --> 01:47:37.203]  We should have a variety of opinions on those sort of things.
[01:47:37.803 --> 01:47:47.409]  But I don't think we can have unity in supporting some of the Neopon's plans, ultimate plans, for war against China and Russia.
[01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:55.315]  And I believe that the attacks against Iraq and possibly now Iran are really merely a stepping stone to that.
[01:47:55.395 --> 01:47:56.876]  If you read the PNAC documents,
[01:47:58.125 --> 01:47:59.766]  They say they're encircling China.
[01:47:59.786 --> 01:48:00.306]  I understand.
[01:48:00.746 --> 01:48:14.816]  And what I'm trying to say is that I think much of this military-industrial Nazi-Birchite propaganda that I hear on your program and others are actually falling into that trap of playing right into their hands.
[01:48:14.836 --> 01:48:16.397]  See John, this is what you can't get.
[01:48:16.417 --> 01:48:17.898]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:48:18.238 --> 01:48:19.739]  This is what you can't get, John.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:25.583]  I believe government, big government, is dangerous and almost always corrupt and evil throughout history.
[01:48:25.923 --> 01:48:27.144]  And that's history and it shows it.
[01:48:27.888 --> 01:48:29.810]  You, because he's called many times, Michael.
[01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:31.611]  I'm not putting words in his mouth.
[01:48:33.152 --> 01:48:36.354]  You believe, sir, that communists are good and capitalists are bad.
[01:48:36.454 --> 01:48:36.875]  No, sir.
[01:48:37.075 --> 01:48:40.678]  Big centralized governments are corrupt and bad, on average.
[01:48:41.458 --> 01:48:44.220]  And the communists are bad, and so are the globalists.
[01:48:44.681 --> 01:48:48.483]  And the globalists work with the communists, and you can't figure that out.
[01:48:48.824 --> 01:48:50.385]  Michael, you got any comments on the communists?
[01:48:50.405 --> 01:48:51.305]  No, actually I do, Alex.
[01:48:52.486 --> 01:48:55.889]  First thing I'd say is, partly, part of your response
[01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:57.571]  We're good to go.
[01:49:10.825 --> 01:49:11.265]  Corrupt.
[01:49:11.786 --> 01:49:13.947]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:18.210]  And yet, without changing that story, we can't reclaim our future.
[01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:29.537]  We have got to insert into the body politic people who have values, who value what this country stands for, and want it to be all that it can.
[01:49:29.717 --> 01:49:31.238]  Well, we need people who are going to fight.
[01:49:31.278 --> 01:49:33.019]  We need people who are going to fight and aren't going to roll over.
[01:49:33.059 --> 01:49:35.840]  Listen, if you want to be free, you're going to have to fight, folks.
[01:49:35.941 --> 01:49:36.541]  It's that simple.
[01:49:37.498 --> 01:49:39.079]  People who don't fight become slaves.
[01:49:39.159 --> 01:49:39.640]  Guaranteed.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.660]  Michael Berger, stay there.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.161]  We'll come back.
[01:49:41.721 --> 01:49:48.285]  Talk to Ron, Sean, and a lady from New York, and many, many others.
[01:49:48.305 --> 01:49:48.365]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:54.102 --> 01:49:56.945]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.205 --> 01:49:58.786]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.127 --> 01:50:03.791]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.151 --> 01:50:08.575]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:08.996 --> 01:50:13.200]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.243]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.343 --> 01:50:18.845]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:50:19.025 --> 01:50:25.631]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:25.831 --> 01:50:33.058]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.318 --> 01:50:35.740]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:55.364 --> 01:51:06.069]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:06.449 --> 01:51:10.971]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:22.377]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:22.957 --> 01:51:29.801]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:30.202 --> 01:51:32.343]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:32.843 --> 01:51:37.807]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:51:38.107 --> 01:51:44.251]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-9000.

[01:51:49.814 --> 01:51:49.794]  8 0 3 4 4 3 8.

[01:53:15.713 --> 01:53:24.099]  I want to keep Michael Berger five minutes to the next hour so we can take the callers that are here for him.
[01:53:24.119 --> 01:53:25.980]  And then I'm going to get into a bunch of the other news.
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:28.642]  Iran, the dollar, so much more.
[01:53:29.262 --> 01:53:34.086]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Oklahoma, then Sean, Rita, David, and others.
[01:53:34.126 --> 01:53:34.686]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:53:35.167 --> 01:53:36.908]  Alex, several things quickly.
[01:53:37.568 --> 01:53:42.512]  I was told by a friend whose brother-in-law was an air traffic controller on the East Coast.
[01:53:42.772 --> 01:53:43.953]  Brother-in-law told him that
[01:53:44.403 --> 01:53:50.489]  Flight 93 was shot down, and the following day the Feds came in and collected all the tapes and records.
[01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:53.731]  Well, Rumsfeld has slipped up twice and said they shot it down.
[01:53:54.212 --> 01:53:54.752]  Well, they did.
[01:53:54.772 --> 01:54:06.123]  Also, Colonel Craig Roberts, flighty, Alex, every time he's on with anything to say, your nighttime rerun, his zap is wiped out.
[01:54:06.223 --> 01:54:08.004]  We couldn't even pick it up off the internet.
[01:54:08.044 --> 01:54:09.866]  Your first hour was obliterated.
[01:54:10.991 --> 01:54:20.577]  Also, Alex, the lady and attorney in Ohio was called several times about being harassed by state-sponsored Affirmative Action Union criminal terrorists.
[01:54:20.697 --> 01:54:23.299]  I've had the same thing happen to me here in Oklahoma City.
[01:54:23.319 --> 01:54:24.159]  Let me back up for a second.
[01:54:24.199 --> 01:54:26.221]  You're saying on the internet and shortwave, what happened?
[01:54:27.141 --> 01:54:28.202]  Both of them were wiped out.
[01:54:28.762 --> 01:54:29.583]  You just couldn't hear them?
[01:54:30.904 --> 01:54:34.446]  Well, the internet started looping and then it just went blank.
[01:54:36.579 --> 01:54:39.640]  The second hour was fine, picked it up, no problem.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.280]  I wanted to record it and pass it out.
[01:54:42.121 --> 01:54:44.081]  But they were both wiped out.
[01:54:44.621 --> 01:54:46.502]  Yeah, that's a wonderful network, probably.
[01:54:46.982 --> 01:54:50.803]  Well, it happens every time Craig Roberts is on.
[01:54:50.923 --> 01:54:52.543]  It is not your wonderful network.
[01:54:54.364 --> 01:55:03.386]  Oklahoma is behind the black hole, behind the Iron Curtain, the information Iron Curtain.
[01:55:03.426 --> 01:55:04.907]  We do not get information here.
[01:55:07.665 --> 01:55:10.106]  Okay, Ron, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:10.546 --> 01:55:13.606]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in New Hampshire.
[01:55:13.666 --> 01:55:14.346]  Sean, go ahead.
[01:55:14.366 --> 01:55:14.926]  You're on the air.
[01:55:15.647 --> 01:55:16.427]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:16.507 --> 01:55:17.587]  Great to be on your show again.
[01:55:18.767 --> 01:55:22.228]  I'm also a scholar at 9-11 Truth and an engineer.
[01:55:22.688 --> 01:55:24.108]  I graduated from RPI in 1986.
[01:55:25.549 --> 01:55:31.930]  And something I want to be able to tell people is the people in the truth movement, the fact that you're presenting
[01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:34.990]  Do not take engineers to figure out.
[01:55:35.090 --> 01:55:41.952]  Any second year engineering student would be able to figure out that this story is a lie and it's false.
[01:55:42.812 --> 01:55:51.553]  So you don't have to be a, you know, you don't have to have a doctorate degree to look at this to draw conclusions that we're being lied to.
[01:55:51.673 --> 01:55:56.774]  And then the question is, why do they have so many engineers that will concoct wild stories to explain it?
[01:55:56.834 --> 01:55:59.855]  That's because they're people that'll do anything for government contracts.
[01:55:59.895 --> 01:56:00.415]  Michael Berger?
[01:56:00.835 --> 01:56:02.557]  Oh, I think it's far deeper.
[01:56:02.597 --> 01:56:04.138]  I think it's a psychological thing.
[01:56:04.178 --> 01:56:09.262]  I think if you confront the truth, I mean, look, what your caller is saying is exactly the case.
[01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:21.432]  Anybody who is a witness to this live or looked at the footage afterward, it is really difficult to understand how you can see those buildings come down the way they did.
[01:56:21.912 --> 01:56:23.734]  Or let's even forget about the towers.
[01:56:23.794 --> 01:56:24.194]  Talk about 7.
[01:56:25.035 --> 01:56:29.919]  You see 7, even Dan Rather Live is saying, yeah, it looks just like one of those buildings with a controlled demolition.
[01:56:30.539 --> 01:56:33.162]  So, the issue is a deeper psychological one.
[01:56:33.202 --> 01:56:37.045]  If you confront this, you really... I agree, they just can't face it.
[01:56:37.365 --> 01:56:41.389]  You've got to take responsibility to stand up, and I think you just can't.
[01:56:41.429 --> 01:56:52.559]  The denial is so great, because everything we've been taught, everything we've learned about who we are in the world, who we are as Americans, is contradicted by what your eyes are telling you.
[01:56:52.759 --> 01:56:55.661]  I agree, and then the science backs up what the eyes are telling you.
[01:56:56.162 --> 01:56:57.283]  Go ahead and finish up, Sean.
[01:56:58.184 --> 01:57:03.710]  Yes, and so what I do as a citizen and as an engineer is I pass out your tapes.
[01:57:04.651 --> 01:57:08.435]  I also help produce the JPFO film, Innocence Betrayed.
[01:57:08.914 --> 01:57:21.757]  There's also another good one JPFO produced about a Bill of Rights culture, which I also helped produce, you know, donating money, and getting these out to people and talking with them and explaining it.
[01:57:21.837 --> 01:57:23.497]  What are your fellow engineers saying?
[01:57:23.577 --> 01:57:23.937]  Stay there.
[01:57:23.957 --> 01:57:26.478]  We're going to start in the third hour, but I want you to stay there for a minute, Sean.
[01:57:26.498 --> 01:57:31.179]  I want to hear what your fellow engineers say when you talk to them about the collapse of the towers.
[01:57:32.665 --> 01:57:39.811]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.879 --> 01:57:49.559]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:51.281]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.961 --> 01:57:53.042]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.723 --> 01:57:54.523]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.304 --> 01:57:56.065]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.224 --> 01:58:00.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.026 --> 01:58:05.107]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.608 --> 01:58:09.949]  We're talking to documentary filmmaker Michael Berger.
[01:58:09.989 --> 01:58:11.870]  He's got the film Improbable Collapse coming out.
[01:58:11.890 --> 01:58:12.510]  Looks powerful.
[01:58:14.481 --> 01:58:19.865]  And he's also helping put on the 9-11 Truth Conference they're going to be having up in Chicago, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of June.
[01:58:19.885 --> 01:58:22.667]  We're having our own event, 24th and 25th of June in L.A.
[01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:25.530]  Those tickets are selling fast, so be sure and get them for both events.
[01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:33.496]  We'll take a few final calls here for Michael, then we're going to let him go, and I'm going to get into a bunch of other news and warrior calls throughout this third hour.
[01:58:33.956 --> 01:58:37.999]  The Iran situation really heating up economically, not just militarily.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:41.262]  Right now, let's go back to Sean New Hampshire, who's an engineer.
[01:58:41.682 --> 01:58:43.063]  Sean, you're saying you're a member of 9-11 Scholars.
[01:58:45.045 --> 01:58:49.868]  When you talk to fellow engineering associates, what do they say about what happened on 9-11?
[01:58:50.868 --> 01:58:53.650]  A good deal of them, after I present them with the facts.
[01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:59.434]  And engineers just, you know, they don't take anything on face value, a lot of them.
[01:58:59.954 --> 01:59:00.955]  Some are stunned.
[01:59:01.075 --> 01:59:04.337]  Some, you know, they just bury their head in the sand.
[01:59:04.397 --> 01:59:06.938]  Oh, I want to be apolitical and I don't want to lose my job.
[01:59:07.639 --> 01:59:09.280]  They acknowledge that you're right.
[01:59:09.963 --> 01:59:11.384]  But they don't want to do anything about it.
[01:59:11.404 --> 01:59:12.644]  Yeah, I know a lot of engineers.
[01:59:12.704 --> 01:59:19.106]  In fact, I interviewed a family friend, Jimmy Wright, who's a structural engineer who worked at the World Financial Center across the street that day.
[01:59:19.667 --> 01:59:27.990]  He was on the show at 11 a.m., just an hour and a half after the collapses, and he said, it's total controlled demolition, total bombs, perfect precision.
[01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:31.071]  It imploded, fell in on itself, used all the terms.
[01:59:31.491 --> 01:59:33.472]  A week later, he just goes, no, no, I was wrong.
[01:59:33.552 --> 01:59:34.172]  No, it's not true!
[01:59:34.452 --> 01:59:35.272]  And I was out of his house.
[01:59:35.312 --> 01:59:36.753]  He's like, no, I'm not going to talk about it!
[01:59:38.092 --> 01:59:40.234]  So, I mean, is that the kind of response you get?
[01:59:41.354 --> 01:59:42.075]  That's some of it.
[01:59:42.135 --> 01:59:55.622]  Some of them know it's true, and they start passing out your books and videos and start telling other people, hey, look guys, you know, this is just a total free-for-all for the government.
[01:59:56.322 --> 02:00:04.667]  And then there are some that will try and contradict you, will try and prove you're wrong, and after a period of time, they'll be like, oh my God, you're right.
[02:00:06.188 --> 02:00:09.710]  What percentage would you say are waking up?
[02:00:09.730 --> 02:00:13.873]  I would say at least a good half of them know the actual truth.
[02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:18.355]  Out of that, 20% of those are starting to take action.
[02:00:19.016 --> 02:00:26.140]  I woke up and I'm the type of person that's like, okay, we've got to stop this, we've got to nip it in the bud.
[02:00:26.661 --> 02:00:30.864]  Because the engineers know it, but everybody has to know it.
[02:00:30.944 --> 02:00:31.784]  They're going to do more.
[02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:33.505]  They're going to do more if we don't stop this.
[02:00:33.525 --> 02:00:35.846]  You know, I've got some more questions for Michael Berg.
[02:00:35.866 --> 02:00:36.847]  Thanks for the call, Sean.
[02:00:36.867 --> 02:00:39.369]  So I'm going to try to hold him over a few more minutes if he can.
[02:00:39.629 --> 02:00:41.290]  Let's jam one more in here.
[02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:42.270]  Rita in Illinois.
[02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.811]  Go ahead, Rita.
[02:00:42.831 --> 02:00:43.351]  You're on the air.
[02:00:43.371 --> 02:00:44.732]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:44.932 --> 02:00:45.792]  I have a few things.
[02:00:45.812 --> 02:00:50.135]  I want something I would love to say to you and something I'd like to say to your guests, too.
[02:00:50.275 --> 02:00:53.437]  Is your guest aware of Joan Vian and her work?
[02:00:54.286 --> 02:00:59.330]  Because what's going to happen, say for instance, okay, everybody agrees that this is really bad, there's going to be this vacuum.
[02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:14.182]  And then they're going to jump in, and then the fake, what do you call it... Yeah, she's saying that the globalists will burn Bush and their minions, and the very people that orchestrated it all will then say, see, America's bad, we've got to have a one world government because they carried out terror attacks.
[02:01:15.122 --> 02:01:16.984]  Joan Vion's work is so important, though.
[02:01:17.604 --> 02:01:17.804]  Sure.
[02:01:17.844 --> 02:01:24.486]  Well, the fact is, regardless of what the outcome is of exposing this, we have to expose it, and they're going to keep using terror unless we expose it.
[02:01:24.526 --> 02:01:24.806]  Michael?
[02:01:25.526 --> 02:01:28.506]  Yeah, I mean, that's one of the things that Chicago is about.
[02:01:28.546 --> 02:01:33.107]  Again, I'd also like to plug the website, 911revealingthetruth.org.
[02:01:33.548 --> 02:01:44.530]  The conference is about coming up with a strategy and a plan of action, and in fact, one of the things that I want to present on is whenever I speak or I do public appearances and meet people,
[02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:47.393]  I'm always asked, you know, what do you want me to do?
[02:01:47.453 --> 02:01:48.514]  I'm only one person.
[02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:49.696]  I don't have any power.
[02:01:49.716 --> 02:01:53.680]  So we're trying to formulate a strategy around telling people what we think the solutions are.
[02:01:53.821 --> 02:01:55.623]  Yeah, I mean what can people do to engage?
[02:01:55.683 --> 02:01:59.828]  Because as the caller just pointed out, if people do wake up to this,
[02:02:00.368 --> 02:02:13.591]  There's going to be a lot of anger, there's going to be a lot of frustration, and it's going to be really easy for the powers that be to just shift the players and make it appear as if everything has been taken care of and everybody can go back to sleep and it's okay.
[02:02:13.991 --> 02:02:25.513]  But it isn't, and I think, you know, my opinion, the only way we can change this is if we engage in the political process and take the country back ourselves and hold ourselves accountable to govern ourselves.
[02:02:25.593 --> 02:02:28.574]  Okay, Rita, does that answer your question or I'm trying to get the point you were making?
[02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:29.794]  Absolutely not!
[02:02:29.974 --> 02:02:31.056]  I'm really confused.
[02:02:31.256 --> 02:02:33.760]  We're just trying to expose 9-11 and it sounds like you're mad at us.
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:35.043]  Stay there and tell us why when we get back.
[02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:52.953]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.233 --> 02:02:57.976]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.196 --> 02:03:03.859]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.079 --> 02:03:08.603]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:08.823 --> 02:03:15.989]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:20.553]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.714 --> 02:03:23.216]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:23.456 --> 02:03:30.162]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:03:54.816 --> 02:04:06.066]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.386 --> 02:04:11.211]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,

[02:05:18.442 --> 02:05:18.762]  I don't know.
[02:05:45.828 --> 02:05:51.852]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.452 --> 02:05:55.494]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:04.259 --> 02:06:06.020]  Tell you, Michael Berger is our guest.
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.260]  He's an amazing individual.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.241]  A new film coming out I've seen excerpts of.
[02:06:09.281 --> 02:06:09.842]  It's amazing.
[02:06:10.642 --> 02:06:11.643]  Improbable Collapse.
[02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:14.973]  And we're taking your calls concerning 9-11.
[02:06:15.033 --> 02:06:19.594]  So I'm just going to shut up with this caller that we were just talking to and let her make her point.
[02:06:20.134 --> 02:06:21.414]  Because she sounds irritated.
[02:06:21.434 --> 02:06:22.254]  Oh, is she still there?
[02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:23.695]  She just dropped.
[02:06:23.755 --> 02:06:24.635]  I told her to hold.
[02:06:25.535 --> 02:06:29.176]  She called in from Illinois.
[02:06:29.296 --> 02:06:29.676]  Rita.
[02:06:29.696 --> 02:06:30.637]  Sounds like a nice lady.
[02:06:30.657 --> 02:06:31.737]  I'm sure she's a great person.
[02:06:32.945 --> 02:06:35.007]  And she was like, do you know about Charlotte Isserby?
[02:06:35.047 --> 02:06:40.231]  Do you know about Joan Vion, who we carry some of their books, we have them on routinely?
[02:06:40.251 --> 02:06:44.975]  You know, it sounds like you don't know anything, Mr. Berger.
[02:06:45.115 --> 02:06:58.906]  And so I'm trying to... Perhaps she's saying you don't know the whole New World Order agenda, and you don't understand the whole globalist operation, and so somehow we're doing bad or something?
[02:07:00.308 --> 02:07:01.529]  What did you get from that call?
[02:07:01.889 --> 02:07:10.619]  Well, I think it was a certain frustration of if you wake people up, they have to have a way to plug in to connect with other people to take action.
[02:07:11.159 --> 02:07:17.306]  And that really is the focus of this conference, so it may have been just a miscommunication.
[02:07:18.863 --> 02:07:23.525]  Well, I mean, some of the times people call me, and I know the type of call it is.
[02:07:23.605 --> 02:07:25.346]  I mean, I always recognize it right off the bat.
[02:07:25.386 --> 02:07:29.588]  It's like, you're not doing enough, Alex, or you're not covering the key issues.
[02:07:29.708 --> 02:07:30.689]  I cover everything!
[02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:33.250]  And, I don't know, it's just frustrating sometimes.
[02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:36.872]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Illinois.
[02:07:36.892 --> 02:07:37.672]  David, you're on the air.
[02:07:37.712 --> 02:07:38.092]  Go ahead.
[02:07:38.953 --> 02:07:39.393]  Hey, Alex.
[02:07:39.873 --> 02:07:39.973]  Hi.
[02:07:39.993 --> 02:07:46.176]  You know, it wasn't hard for me to accept that, you know, 19 Al-Qaeda guys
[02:07:48.536 --> 02:07:48.676]  Yeah.
[02:08:18.812 --> 02:08:21.034]  I'm a pundit from France a couple hundred years ago.
[02:08:22.095 --> 02:08:28.860]  Democracy is bad because of the possibility of tyranny by the majority.
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:42.390]  And in this country, you know, I am not anti-Semitic, but I don't think I would put America before Israel that was created in my lifetime.
[02:08:43.051 --> 02:08:47.294]  You know, and Palestine was wiped off the face of the earth to create Israel.
[02:08:48.067 --> 02:08:57.131]  And if that issue cannot be looked at and discussed honestly, and if we have to pussyfoot around it, then our democracy is in trouble.
[02:08:57.151 --> 02:08:58.452]  Well, let me comment.
[02:08:58.492 --> 02:08:59.152]  Let me comment.
[02:08:59.252 --> 02:09:01.553]  Number one, we're a constitutional republic.
[02:09:02.354 --> 02:09:04.635]  Number two, I've read de Tocqueville's book.
[02:09:05.493 --> 02:09:19.797]  Number three, I've seen this view, we witnessed this view from a big professor out of Colorado, Ward Churchill, that the people that died in the towers were Nazis.
[02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:31.216]  Jewish Nazis, basically, is what he said, and that they were casualties of war, and that Bin Laden's basically a hero, and that played into the neocons plan.
[02:09:31.236 --> 02:09:38.201]  I know a lot of people that say Israel needs to go down, and Bin Laden did do 9-11, and Bin Laden did a good job.
[02:09:38.241 --> 02:09:43.364]  Now, I'm not saying you're saying that, but number one, sir, Bin Laden can't make cell phones work
[02:09:43.724 --> 02:09:44.664]  at 30,000 feet.
[02:09:44.704 --> 02:09:46.545]  Bin Laden can't make NORAD stand down.
[02:09:46.805 --> 02:09:48.905]  Bin Laden can't run war games that day.
[02:09:49.185 --> 02:09:57.167]  Bin Laden can't call public officials from the White House and tell them don't fly, and call mayors, and call Joint Chiefs of Staff, and call Salman Rushdie.
[02:09:57.487 --> 02:10:04.148]  Bin Laden can't engage in insider trading that leads back to CIA deputy directors' companies' put options.
[02:10:04.488 --> 02:10:06.169]  Bin Laden can't mask U.S.
[02:10:06.209 --> 02:10:08.529]  and British troops, 44,000 U.S., 18,000 British in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan,
[02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:13.731]  Two days before the 9-11 attack.
[02:10:14.612 --> 02:10:17.934]  And Bin Laden didn't write Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[02:10:17.954 --> 02:10:22.837]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks and blame it on Cuba from the 60s.
[02:10:23.217 --> 02:10:25.258]  Bin Laden didn't carry out the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:10:25.278 --> 02:10:27.219]  Bin Laden didn't carry out the USS Liberty.
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:28.900]  By the way, Israel did.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:30.421]  So I criticize Israel.
[02:10:30.461 --> 02:10:32.222]  I criticize AIPAC.
[02:10:32.302 --> 02:10:33.423]  I criticize the fact
[02:10:34.023 --> 02:10:40.328]  That they're in our government, manipulating our government, and so are the Chinese, and so are the British, and our country's totally sold out.
[02:10:40.728 --> 02:10:44.831]  So I'm, again, I'm having trouble here navigating exactly what you're saying.
[02:10:44.891 --> 02:10:45.792]  Boil it down for me.
[02:10:45.852 --> 02:10:46.432]  I'm stupid.
[02:10:46.973 --> 02:10:53.858]  Well, I think that they were looking for, that there was knowledge in this government that these terrorists were going to do something.
[02:10:54.178 --> 02:10:55.499]  So you think they let it happen?
[02:10:56.019 --> 02:11:02.524]  I think they let it happen to have a Pearl Harbor event, so they could start a war with Iraq, so that they could control, put
[02:11:03.234 --> 02:11:05.796]  Okay, you're an engineer, sir.
[02:11:05.816 --> 02:11:06.657]  You say you're an engineer.
[02:11:06.677 --> 02:11:09.540]  I believe you said that.
[02:11:11.622 --> 02:11:12.522]  I misunderstood you then.
[02:11:12.542 --> 02:11:13.083]  What did you say?
[02:11:13.103 --> 02:11:17.307]  Oh, I said I'm not an engineer, but I understand the concept.
[02:11:17.487 --> 02:11:19.529]  Okay, I thought you said, I'm an engineer, I understand the concept.
[02:11:19.709 --> 02:11:20.690]  You say you're not an engineer.
[02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:22.591]  Sir, we've interviewed engineers.
[02:11:22.631 --> 02:11:23.632]  We've talked to engineers.
[02:11:23.672 --> 02:11:25.694]  We've talked to the people that underwrote the buildings.
[02:11:25.794 --> 02:11:26.675]  Let me just finish.
[02:11:26.735 --> 02:11:27.636]  Let me just finish here.
[02:11:28.317 --> 02:11:28.597]  Okay?
[02:11:30.114 --> 02:11:41.482]  The 9-11 whitewash commission said there were no major steel columns in the middle of the building, and all those made-for-TV shows, Why the Towers Collapsed, and shows like that, tell you it didn't have any columns in the middle.
[02:11:42.023 --> 02:11:44.164]  It was overbuilt, okay?
[02:11:44.565 --> 02:11:47.467]  So, Michael Berger, you got any comments for this?
[02:11:48.127 --> 02:11:53.129]  Well, first, the admission of Bin Laden that he was the responsible party.
[02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:57.250]  There are some questions about the validity of that tape to begin with.
[02:11:57.470 --> 02:12:00.771]  In another sit-down interview days after, he said, I didn't do it, the U.S.
[02:12:00.811 --> 02:12:01.412]  and Israel did.
[02:12:03.272 --> 02:12:12.541]  Once again, everywhere in the official story, it's rife with self-contradictions, with open testimony under oath that contradicted later testimony.
[02:12:12.561 --> 02:12:15.083]  And they'll do it three, four, five times.
[02:12:15.123 --> 02:12:18.186]  They keep contradicting with new outlandish stories each time.
[02:12:18.526 --> 02:12:23.010]  Exactly, and they just keep digging themselves a bigger and bigger hole, kind of like with Able Danger.
[02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:24.631]  Oh, no, first they didn't tell us.
[02:12:24.711 --> 02:12:27.094]  Then, yeah, they did tell us, but it was too late.
[02:12:27.114 --> 02:12:28.355]  Ah, we didn't think it was credible.
[02:12:28.955 --> 02:12:47.566]  You know, how many times are we going to... I mean, David Ray Griffin said it greatest, you know, the American people have been incredibly tolerant of all of the varying lies that have informed our foreign policy, and if the American people were to wake up to the truth about 9-11...
[02:12:50.647 --> 02:13:13.267]  There would be an uprising in this country and so unless we all come together and overlook our differences and create a strategy and a plan to actually take back the country and to get people like you and I into office with a different script such that we get held accountable to the same standards we expect to hold other elected officials accountable
[02:13:14.255 --> 02:13:21.438]  That we can change the whole story of, once you are in office, you do not become a corruptible influence.
[02:13:21.558 --> 02:13:25.520]  David, I'm not trying to jump on you, I'm just frustrated by the things you're saying.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.041]  I mean, boil it down for me, in a nutshell, what are you saying?
[02:13:29.261 --> 02:13:43.167]  I want to say, I appreciated your show, and I learned some, you know, some really interesting, I had to catch one kind of amazing show, I think you called the police chief who was talking about, it was supposed to be for microchipping in New Jersey, and he happened to be the one who
[02:13:44.062 --> 02:13:51.445]  Who came across five Mossad agents videotaping the towers and jumping up and down gleefully.
[02:13:51.485 --> 02:13:55.367]  I don't know if that was just... Yeah, that was Bergen County, New Jersey.
[02:13:57.408 --> 02:14:05.751]  The county police chief, they have county police chiefs there, going, he'll make us all take microchips if the government orders it, and he wants his employees to take them.
[02:14:06.111 --> 02:14:11.734]  And then, by the way, he was also the guy that had some of the Israelis arrested, and then we got into that, yes.
[02:14:13.055 --> 02:14:18.178]  So, anyway, you know, I'm living... So are you saying Bin Laden did it, or are you saying the Israelis did it?
[02:14:18.198 --> 02:14:18.879]  I mean, what are you saying?
[02:14:19.259 --> 02:14:31.466]  I'm saying that, you know, what I frankly thought was they were... the 19 people were far more successful that the government was looking for an event to go back into Iraq.
[02:14:31.546 --> 02:14:32.447]  I mean, that's obvious.
[02:14:32.487 --> 02:14:34.268]  That's been planned for some time.
[02:14:34.995 --> 02:14:38.796]  And to have control of the Mideast oil, and also to build a pipeline to Israel.
[02:14:39.037 --> 02:14:42.598]  Well, they admit all that, but listen... Talk about it in the U.S.
[02:14:42.638 --> 02:14:42.918]  media.
[02:14:43.198 --> 02:14:44.719]  Sure, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:14:45.199 --> 02:14:52.782]  Instead of what you think, instead of what sounds good, instead of what fits into your world view, and I'm not trying to be mean here, how about you just look at the facts?
[02:14:53.642 --> 02:14:53.962]  You see.
[02:14:54.562 --> 02:14:58.484]  Let's go ahead and make a final call for our guest, Michael Berger, Reagan in California.
[02:14:58.524 --> 02:14:59.044]  Go ahead, Reagan.
[02:14:59.784 --> 02:15:00.705]  Hi, how are you?
[02:15:01.185 --> 02:15:02.086]  I've got something.
[02:15:02.166 --> 02:15:08.070]  A friend of mine sent this to me about the Pentagon and she said please pass it on because it has been yanked.
[02:15:08.991 --> 02:15:10.172]  It's the Pentagon.
[02:15:10.873 --> 02:15:15.196]  It's www.PentagonStrike.com.
[02:15:16.545 --> 02:15:22.027]  But if it's been yanked, how are we going to go look at it there?
[02:15:22.227 --> 02:15:27.788]  Somebody put it back up and she said please have people look at it before they pull it again.
[02:15:27.848 --> 02:15:31.209]  Yeah, I think something like over a hundred million people have watched that.
[02:15:31.249 --> 02:15:32.709]  They've estimated it's all over the web.
[02:15:33.149 --> 02:15:34.050]  Okay, I didn't know.
[02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:39.711]  One thing before I go, and if we want to take back this country and do exactly what you
[02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:45.856]  And your guests are saying the best way to do it is to demand that we get those towers back.
[02:15:46.417 --> 02:15:47.018]  Thanks a lot.
[02:15:47.238 --> 02:15:48.099]  Thank you for the call.
[02:15:48.479 --> 02:15:50.942]  Michael Berger, in closing, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:15:50.962 --> 02:15:54.326]  I'll see you coming up June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
[02:15:55.726 --> 02:16:01.389]  And people can find out more details at several of the websites, 911truth.org.
[02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:06.511]  Let me also plug 911revealingthetruth.org, that's the conference website.
[02:16:06.871 --> 02:16:11.753]  Fantastic, and we'll be talking to you in the near future as soon as I get a review copy.
[02:16:12.334 --> 02:16:16.275]  When are you going to send me a review copy of your new Improbable Cause Collapse?
[02:16:16.756 --> 02:16:17.556]  A week from today.
[02:16:18.081 --> 02:16:25.345]  Good, because I want to be able to review it to make sure I want to carry it, because if I do want to carry it, I want to be carrying it day one when it comes out, Michael.
[02:16:25.846 --> 02:16:26.426]  That'd be great.
[02:16:26.926 --> 02:16:28.007]  Fantastic, Alex.
[02:16:28.387 --> 02:16:28.787]  Thank you.
[02:16:29.108 --> 02:16:38.233]  Yeah, thank you for coming on with us, and I'm also going to interview a few of the other speakers over the next month that are going to be at the event, and of course, you'll be hearing from one of the speakers every day here, folks.
[02:16:38.273 --> 02:16:38.473]  That's me.
[02:16:38.493 --> 02:16:39.013]  What do you know?
[02:16:39.033 --> 02:16:40.154]  Yeah, what do you know?
[02:16:40.634 --> 02:16:42.756]  And this was a great interview, my friend.
[02:16:42.796 --> 02:16:43.156]  Take care.
[02:16:43.556 --> 02:16:44.637]  Thank you, Alex, very much.
[02:16:44.737 --> 02:16:45.057]  You bet.
[02:16:45.077 --> 02:16:45.518]  We'll see you.
[02:16:45.538 --> 02:16:46.278]  Stay right there.
[02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:48.420]  I want to talk to you during the break, Michael, okay?
[02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:50.702]  Folks, that was a great interview.
[02:16:50.722 --> 02:16:56.306]  When we get back, we will get into more of the international and national news and move away from 9-11.
[02:16:56.606 --> 02:16:57.847]  You're always welcome to call in.
[02:16:57.867 --> 02:17:01.670]  On the 9-11 subject, it's 1-800-259-9231 is the number to get involved here on the air.
[02:17:06.391 --> 02:17:08.853]  And we'll get into the other news and then take some more calls.
[02:17:09.553 --> 02:17:11.095]  And I sound irritated sometimes.
[02:17:11.195 --> 02:17:13.276]  It's just all I've done is study 9-11.
[02:17:13.296 --> 02:17:16.839]  I've made three films on it, written a book, published a book.
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:20.302]  I've kept my brain in the game.
[02:17:20.322 --> 02:17:28.768]  I have interviewed hundreds and hundreds of prominent people, engineers, politicians, defense ministers.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:41.125]  Firefighters, and we know it's an inside job, and so just to hear people who constantly say, well I've got my own personal view, and it's not really backed up with any facts, it's just, I just think this is what happened.
[02:17:41.626 --> 02:17:42.226]  It's irritating.
[02:17:44.713 --> 02:17:49.995]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[02:19:04.406 --> 02:19:06.448]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[02:19:06.868 --> 02:19:08.389]  They are instruments of death.

[02:19:45.545 --> 02:19:48.046]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.586 --> 02:20:02.629]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?
[02:20:03.289 --> 02:20:12.591]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:45.015 --> 02:20:50.520]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but global
[02:21:00.194 --> 02:21:00.454]  We're good.
[02:21:22.768 --> 02:21:25.809]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[02:21:51.258 --> 02:21:53.599]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:54.959 --> 02:21:58.300]  I'm gonna blitz through a bunch of calls right now, giving each caller about a minute.
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:02.501]  And then I'm gonna get into Iran and the other news after the break and then take more calls after that.
[02:22:02.881 --> 02:22:04.922]  Sean in New Hampshire, you're on the air, go ahead Sean.
[02:22:05.542 --> 02:22:11.524]  Hi Alex, I wanted to give you an update on Bill 1582 in the Senate in New Hampshire.
[02:22:12.714 --> 02:22:21.762]  It looks like after we got the ought to pass that Senators Greg and Representative Bradley... Now remember, a lot of people don't know what this bill is.
[02:22:21.782 --> 02:22:24.085]  That's the bill to say no to the National ID Card.
[02:22:24.325 --> 02:22:24.905]  Exactly.
[02:22:24.965 --> 02:22:27.508]  To have New Hampshire rejected outright.
[02:22:28.189 --> 02:22:30.811]  And it got the ought to pass from Committee and Senate.
[02:22:30.851 --> 02:22:35.676]  And when it came up for vote last Thursday, at the very end of the day,
[02:22:36.542 --> 02:22:49.291]  All the Republicans changed their tune after going into the back room with Greg and Bradley, and they said, well, we want to make an amendment that basically guts the bill and just simply has the committee look at it.
[02:22:50.138 --> 02:22:57.265]  And instead, what we'll do is, we'll do that and... By the way, 200 years ago, committees didn't run this country.
[02:22:57.625 --> 02:23:01.949]  They've set it up now where the committees have the power and the elected representatives don't.
[02:23:02.029 --> 02:23:02.830]  That needs to change.
[02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:03.470]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:23:03.891 --> 02:23:15.381]  Yeah, and so there's this agenda item to go and accept the money, which these Republican Senators want to do, but they haven't exactly done it yet because we've been calling them non-Senators.
[02:23:15.561 --> 02:23:17.082]  Yes, I am after the break.
[02:23:45.981 --> 02:23:48.223]  June the 24th and 25th in L.A.
[02:23:49.023 --> 02:23:49.403]  What's that?
[02:23:49.984 --> 02:23:52.685]  Is that going to be at the downtown Sheraton?
[02:23:53.425 --> 02:23:59.809]  Yes, downtown Sheraton holds over a thousand people and we're going to have video screens showing films, a whole bunch of guests.
[02:24:00.509 --> 02:24:04.732]  It's going to be powerful and it's $74 for one ticket.
[02:24:04.772 --> 02:24:08.094]  It goes down to $34 a ticket when you get multiple tickets.
[02:24:08.134 --> 02:24:10.375]  So the incentive is for more people to come.
[02:24:10.815 --> 02:24:11.435]  Okay, good.
[02:24:11.675 --> 02:24:16.817]  And is it going to be like from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon each day?
[02:24:17.238 --> 02:24:20.879]  Yeah, it's going to be... People don't like to get up that early usually when they're on a vacation.
[02:24:20.979 --> 02:24:22.560]  It's during vacation time in the summer.
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:26.541]  It's going to be from about 11 until 9 at night the first day.
[02:24:27.101 --> 02:24:31.843]  And then it's going to be from about 10 in the morning until 8, 9 at night the next day.
[02:24:31.883 --> 02:24:33.004]  So it's going to be lengthy.
[02:24:33.484 --> 02:24:34.204]  Okay, great.
[02:24:34.784 --> 02:24:35.225]  Thank you, Brian.
[02:24:35.745 --> 02:24:36.185]  Thank you.
[02:24:36.205 --> 02:24:37.686]  And when we get back, I will talk about the dollar.
[02:24:37.706 --> 02:24:38.566]  Do you have any comments on that?
[02:24:39.682 --> 02:24:40.242]  Fantastic.
[02:24:40.282 --> 02:24:41.523]  We'll talk about it after the break.
[02:24:41.824 --> 02:24:43.885]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Texas.
[02:24:43.945 --> 02:24:44.826]  James, you're on the air.
[02:24:44.846 --> 02:24:45.746]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:45.966 --> 02:24:46.167]  Hi.
[02:24:46.287 --> 02:24:48.428]  I just want to let people know that I called.
[02:24:48.448 --> 02:24:52.291]  This is relative to you being on KLBJ yesterday, and I really appreciate that.
[02:24:52.311 --> 02:24:55.153]  I just called Mark Caesar with KLBJM.
[02:24:55.173 --> 02:25:07.722]  That's a message letting him know that I thank him for doing that, and I put in a ridiculous request that he change Rush Limbaugh's show for your live GCN show, and I encourage more people in the KLBJ listening area to do the same thing.
[02:25:08.686 --> 02:25:11.628]  We can do this because it's good to hear you.
[02:25:11.648 --> 02:25:13.510]  Did you like the show yesterday, Ed?
[02:25:13.610 --> 02:25:14.851]  It was fantastic.
[02:25:14.911 --> 02:25:15.551]  Thank you so much.
[02:25:15.571 --> 02:25:16.212]  Thank you, sir.
[02:25:16.772 --> 02:25:18.213]  I'm going to let you go so you can get more calls.
[02:25:18.273 --> 02:25:21.235]  I just want people in Austin and Kalamazoo to hear it.
[02:25:21.575 --> 02:25:23.357]  Hopefully they can do the same thing.
[02:25:25.891 --> 02:25:26.872]  Thank you, I appreciate it.
[02:25:27.413 --> 02:25:29.674]  Yeah, I mean it's the biggest station in Central Texas.
[02:25:29.734 --> 02:25:37.160]  It goes all the way to Dallas and all the way to San Antonio and it's a marquee station and of course they carry George Norrie, Rush Limbaugh, all of that.
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:37.580]  No, no, no.
[02:25:37.861 --> 02:25:38.981]  They want the show.
[02:25:39.902 --> 02:25:42.985]  They just want it live and I'm not live when they want it.
[02:25:43.025 --> 02:25:51.151]  They want me on 7 to 10 and they don't want to carry a refeed like some stations do and I was basically offered the job.
[02:25:51.211 --> 02:25:53.012]  I just can't go over there and do another show every day.
[02:25:53.232 --> 02:25:53.873]  I just can't do it.
[02:25:54.628 --> 02:25:57.051]  I mean, I'd be working 20 hours a day if I did that.
[02:25:57.252 --> 02:25:57.993]  I'd be a mess.
[02:25:59.054 --> 02:26:00.837]  So we're trying to figure something out.
[02:26:00.977 --> 02:26:05.022]  MS is a big media company, and they've got syndication.
[02:26:05.844 --> 02:26:08.447]  And so we'll see what happens.
[02:26:09.008 --> 02:26:10.931]  It's just that, you know,
[02:26:12.797 --> 02:26:13.177]  Who knows?
[02:26:13.457 --> 02:26:15.058]  Just because I want to be on the air locally.
[02:26:15.118 --> 02:26:17.918]  It's weird to be on KJFK and then to be on 1260.
[02:26:18.018 --> 02:26:22.640]  I've been on different AM and FM's and they change formats or they're sold.
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:26.801]  I'll be on a station two or three years and then it sells or changes formats.
[02:26:27.521 --> 02:26:35.303]  And then Austin doesn't have a lot of stations because LBJ, when he was president, didn't allow a lot of licenses here locally because he owned the major TV and radio stations.
[02:26:35.323 --> 02:26:38.164]  The president's family doesn't own LBJ anymore.
[02:26:38.604 --> 02:26:39.124]  Amos does.
[02:26:39.924 --> 02:26:41.925]  And so it's frustrating not to be on here locally.
[02:26:42.578 --> 02:27:04.147]  I mean, we're on 100.1 and some of the other great micros, but it is a bone of contention I have that that hasn't happened in the last two years, and people are demanding it, and KLBJ is trying to respond, and the brass of Emmis is trying to respond, way up above Mark Caesar, who's a great guy in his own right, but that shows you how far this movement's come.
[02:27:05.588 --> 02:27:11.270]  I've been on mom and pop AM and FM stations for eight, nine years, and of course big stations here in Austin.
[02:27:12.285 --> 02:27:15.147]  But to have super blue chip stations.
[02:27:15.627 --> 02:27:25.133]  I mean, MS only owns top stations in Chicago, top stations in New York, top stations in, you know, major cities, LA.
[02:27:25.873 --> 02:27:28.155]  And they are looking at this show.
[02:27:29.235 --> 02:27:33.178]  And so we're going to try to get it expanded with their syndication with Genesis as well.
[02:27:34.899 --> 02:27:35.819]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:37.921]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.801 --> 02:27:41.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.893 --> 02:27:50.876]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[02:27:51.076 --> 02:27:53.418]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[02:27:53.658 --> 02:27:56.959]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[02:27:57.179 --> 02:28:01.922]  Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[02:28:02.222 --> 02:28:09.968]  Protecta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.

[02:28:18.194 --> 02:28:21.356]  We do not compromise quality, because you expect the very best.
[02:28:21.456 --> 02:28:24.538]  We provide products that work right the first time, every time.
[02:28:24.838 --> 02:28:27.280]  So get more when you treat it right with Protecta.

[02:28:44.998 --> 02:28:48.880]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.563]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:54.823 --> 02:29:05.188]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:05.368 --> 02:29:09.710]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:10.690]  We're good to go!
[02:29:24.955 --> 02:29:25.235]  I think so.
[02:29:44.827 --> 02:29:51.150]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:56.212]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[02:29:56.532 --> 02:30:04.156]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.

[02:30:42.632 --> 02:31:01.268]  But that is good news for all of our old line affiliates who've been carrying us, in some cases, eight years.
[02:31:02.168 --> 02:31:04.911]  We've had affiliates who've stuck with us that long, commercial stations.
[02:31:06.022 --> 02:31:20.231]  That now, you know, big blue-chip, mainline, juggernaut stations that are owned by moderate-sized conglomerates, it's nothing like Clear Channel or Westwind, CBS, but it's big, are looking at my broadcast.
[02:31:20.672 --> 02:31:22.833]  It's because this has become so mainstream.
[02:31:23.614 --> 02:31:26.235]  And it's not conspiracy theory, we just cover the facts here.
[02:31:27.756 --> 02:31:28.217]  That's all we do.
[02:31:29.867 --> 02:31:33.090]  Let me get into the news and we'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:43.679]  Will and Johnny and Richard and many others, toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 on this live May 8, 2006 Monday edition.
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:46.881]  I ran once oil markets in Euros.
[02:31:47.622 --> 02:31:53.247]  Now this is old news for our audience, an audience that listens to Truth Radio and listens to the whole truth movement.
[02:31:54.526 --> 02:32:07.253]  Iran took a step on Friday towards establishing an oil market dominated in Euros, a plan analysts described as highly unlikely to materialize, but which in theory could have serious consequences for the U.S.
[02:32:07.293 --> 02:32:07.773]  economy.
[02:32:08.693 --> 02:32:21.740]  Iranian state-run television said the country's oil ministry granted a license for the Euro-dominated market, an idea first floated back in 2004, though just who would trade on it remains unclear.
[02:32:22.879 --> 02:32:39.767]  If the market were to succeed, or if Iran simply demanded payment for its oil and euros, commodities experts said it could lead central bankers around the world to convert some dollar revenues into euros, possibly causing a decline in the dollar's value.
[02:32:40.388 --> 02:32:43.389]  So this just isn't in the financial pages now of newsletters.
[02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.869]  Here it is.
[02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:51.373]  Oil is currently dominated, denominated in dollars, and is dominated I would add, around the globe.
[02:32:52.839 --> 02:32:58.761]  Whether through direct sales between producers and consumers or in trades made on markets in New York and London.
[02:33:00.342 --> 02:33:12.566]  But if one day the world's largest oil producers allow, or worse, demand Euros for their barrels, it would be the financial equivalent of a nuclear strike, said A.G.
[02:33:12.707 --> 02:33:15.988]  Edwards' commodities analyst Bill O'Grady.
[02:33:18.109 --> 02:33:18.989]  Unbelievable!
[02:33:20.186 --> 02:33:29.889]  If OPEC decided they didn't want dollars anymore, he added, it would signal an end of American hegemony by signaling an end to the dollar as the sole reserve currency status.
[02:33:30.409 --> 02:33:34.471]  If the dollar lost its status as the world reserve currency, that would force the U.S.
[02:33:34.511 --> 02:33:37.672]  to fund its massive account deficit by running a trade
[02:33:38.332 --> 02:33:42.277]  Surplus, which would increase inflationary pressures.
[02:33:42.397 --> 02:33:47.503]  O'Grady said there are practical reasons why the Iranian threat is an empty one.
[02:33:47.563 --> 02:33:56.814]  For starters, Iran is not a very attractive site for a market given the volatile nature of its politics, the US sanctions against it, and the lack of a fair legal system.
[02:33:56.854 --> 02:33:58.676]  Moreover, this is no indication
[02:33:59.136 --> 02:34:06.040]  The European Union is interested in vying to become the world's central bank, which requires a willingness to run large currency deficits, he said.
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:16.506]  For one, the US, that has meant allowing cheap imports to undermine the strength of some major industries, including textiles, autos, and electronics manufacturing.
[02:34:17.246 --> 02:34:22.609]  I've never read so much truth in the Associated Press or in the mainstream media in my life!
[02:34:23.289 --> 02:34:25.470]  And it just goes on and on and on!
[02:34:29.618 --> 02:34:43.509]  What they don't tell you is that Saudi Arabia, China, Japan, Germany, France, all of them, Russia, Latin America, they have all moved out of keeping around 95% of their reserve currency.
[02:34:45.959 --> 02:34:52.623]  What they keep in their reserves, being dollars, to about 85% and that's dropping.
[02:34:53.043 --> 02:34:57.245]  Russia and others are saying they plan to move out of the dollar at around 10% a year.
[02:34:57.946 --> 02:35:01.508]  China's moving out of the dollar at around, what did I read, 8% a year.
[02:35:02.008 --> 02:35:06.891]  Japan's only moving out at about 5%, but still that's a big deal.
[02:35:08.192 --> 02:35:12.254]  Iran is already talking about demanding Euros for its oil and moving into that.
[02:35:12.274 --> 02:35:15.416]  They were supposed to launch it a month ago, but now that's slowed down.
[02:35:16.136 --> 02:35:22.824]  So all of this is happening, and listen, even with the dollar still being the world reserve currency, it's been devalued by over 44%.
[02:35:24.746 --> 02:35:31.774]  And now the new Fed Chief Bernanke is saying that if you liked Rumsfeld, excuse me, you liked
[02:35:32.839 --> 02:35:33.739]  Freudian slip there.
[02:35:34.239 --> 02:35:44.082]  If you liked the former Fed Chief going out and doubling the money supply in the last six years, that he's discussing doubling it in the next two.
[02:35:44.442 --> 02:36:00.266]  And then after he made those announcements, he made the money supply, that is the amount of money the Federal Reserve is printing and creating in zeros and ones in computers, 97% of it's digital, that they're going to make that number secret, and it has been secret for the last three months.
[02:36:02.245 --> 02:36:08.869]  So if you thought Alan Greenspan was bad at devaluing the currency, look at what this new Fed Chief is saying he's going to do.
[02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:12.291]  So it's very, very scary.
[02:36:12.331 --> 02:36:20.156]  And by the way, the Fed, the private run-for-profit federal reserve that has its chairman appointed by the President for 10 years stints, only thing federal about it,
[02:36:20.794 --> 02:36:24.755]  Those insiders now have the knowledge of the true money supply and no one else does.
[02:36:25.156 --> 02:36:26.776]  They just said they're going to inflate it mightily.
[02:36:27.156 --> 02:36:29.197]  We have no idea what's even going on.
[02:36:29.717 --> 02:36:31.218]  This is such a big deal.
[02:36:31.258 --> 02:36:36.720]  I mean Americans are getting mad about three plus dollars a gallon for gas right now steadily rising.
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:49.124]  And a lot of that is because the dollar has been devalued and the world refineries, we have their own memos, purposely over the last 10 years bought up over 200 refineries and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[02:36:50.183 --> 02:36:59.488]  But if you're upset about getting ripped off a few hundred dollars a month at the pump, depending on how much you drive, aren't you upset about having your dollar devalued?
[02:37:00.728 --> 02:37:01.909]  This is so horrible!
[02:37:02.349 --> 02:37:03.670]  I mean, I think about it all the time.
[02:37:03.730 --> 02:37:19.078]  I've got two little bank accounts for my children that I try to put money in each month, so if they want to go to college, or they want to have a nest egg for themselves in the future, or if I get whacked next week, they'll have a little bit of money.
[02:37:20.137 --> 02:37:27.443]  And that little bit of cash I've got, that I've been saving for five years, has been devalued!
[02:37:29.784 --> 02:37:33.367]  I mean, inflation is not at 3.4% like we've been told.
[02:37:35.189 --> 02:37:36.630]  It is off the charts.
[02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:40.933]  And what are these yuppies going to do when they learn that this is happening to their money?
[02:37:41.914 --> 02:37:43.235]  What are they going to do?
[02:37:44.195 --> 02:37:47.418]  I mean, everybody should be hopping mad over this.
[02:37:47.458 --> 02:37:48.879]  Now, I wish
[02:37:49.921 --> 02:37:54.742]  I would have taken the limited cash I had, and put more of it in gold.
[02:37:55.503 --> 02:37:56.203]  I did do it!
[02:37:56.743 --> 02:38:02.164]  Four years ago, I only owned a couple gold coins, and every month I'd buy another gold coin.
[02:38:02.845 --> 02:38:10.927]  And over time that built up to not a lot, but you know, substantive, and it's literally, literally in an undisclosed location buried two feet under the ground.
[02:38:11.967 --> 02:38:14.488]  And my wife's the only other person who knows where it is.
[02:38:15.128 --> 02:38:19.149]  So if something ever happens to me, or whatever happens, she's got something that
[02:38:19.847 --> 02:38:21.309]  That didn't get devalued by 44%.
[02:38:22.891 --> 02:38:23.131]  No.
[02:38:23.652 --> 02:38:28.718]  She gets something that we bought on average for about $300 an ounce that's now $640 plus an ounce.
[02:38:29.759 --> 02:38:32.782]  And I'm not even telling you where to buy gold or to get gold or what to do.
[02:38:33.263 --> 02:38:39.771]  I like to buy semi-numismatics that are collectibles at bullion prices.
[02:38:40.718 --> 02:38:43.199]  I like to try to find it and you can find it.
[02:38:43.619 --> 02:38:48.060]  That way you get some collectability and added value and then it's non confiscatable.
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:52.102]  Yes, my grandmother remembers when she was a little girl in 1933.
[02:38:53.562 --> 02:38:56.223]  She told me, what's the name of her grandfather?
[02:38:56.583 --> 02:38:58.223]  Her father was named Forrest.
[02:38:59.304 --> 02:39:03.125]  And she remembers that the locals were turning in their gold.
[02:39:04.637 --> 02:39:10.540]  And that her daddy turned some of it in, because they had cops coming around, and if they knew you had gold, they'd want to just take the deposit box and took it.
[02:39:10.841 --> 02:39:12.802]  But her granddaddy didn't give up all his gold.
[02:39:12.822 --> 02:39:13.542]  He gave up a little bit.
[02:39:13.582 --> 02:39:14.242]  Most people did.
[02:39:14.543 --> 02:39:15.923]  And that's how they survived.
[02:39:15.963 --> 02:39:17.564]  The feds would have totally broken this country.
[02:39:18.085 --> 02:39:19.946]  And they shipped all that gold to Europe.
[02:39:19.966 --> 02:39:20.886]  They gave all of it.
[02:39:21.286 --> 02:39:27.470]  They gave, well that's an exaggeration, almost all of it, to Europe, where gold trading was still legal.
[02:39:28.090 --> 02:39:41.474]  And our government overnight, after the confiscation, doubled the price overnight, and the bankers who had taken our gold for paper they gave us back, more than doubled it, and got that huge profit for themselves.
[02:39:41.494 --> 02:39:42.795]  It was actually more than a doubling after.
[02:39:43.435 --> 02:39:46.176]  When they first then reset the price of gold, it doubled.
[02:39:46.196 --> 02:39:47.736]  You can go research the history, and then it went up.
[02:39:48.436 --> 02:39:56.279]  There was a huge gold rush after that, and the Firestone family, people got arrested because they were caught setting up dummy corporations in Europe to buy gold.
[02:39:56.799 --> 02:39:57.499]  Big scandal!
[02:39:58.806 --> 02:40:01.307]  And I don't mean to rant and rave about this subject.
[02:40:01.467 --> 02:40:07.310]  It just makes me so angry that I thought I would just diversify.
[02:40:07.370 --> 02:40:10.171]  I knew the dollar would be devalued four years ago.
[02:40:10.191 --> 02:40:12.032]  The White House announced they were going to do it.
[02:40:12.492 --> 02:40:15.013]  The Globalist announced they'd do it at Davos and other places.
[02:40:15.393 --> 02:40:16.994]  The Davos World Economic Forum.
[02:40:17.614 --> 02:40:21.856]  But to see them do it, and do it this fast, and I thought it would be 20%.
[02:40:22.836 --> 02:40:27.178]  I mean, to see 40 plus percent and growing, in fact, it just
[02:40:28.374 --> 02:40:29.154]  It's horrible!
[02:40:29.674 --> 02:40:31.555]  They devalued the dollar!
[02:40:31.575 --> 02:40:33.175]  Do you know what this means?
[02:40:33.695 --> 02:40:34.716]  They've robbed you!
[02:40:34.796 --> 02:40:38.177]  It's the equivalent of you got $20,000 in the bank and now it's worth $12,000!
[02:40:38.257 --> 02:40:40.097]  And it's going to go down even more!
[02:40:40.117 --> 02:40:41.778]  That is so frustrating!
[02:40:52.569 --> 02:40:53.690]  And the globalists did it!
[02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:59.337]  They admit in the Associated Press that our government made the decision to do it to support globalism!
[02:41:00.109 --> 02:41:13.623]  To create, quote, interdependence, to build up these foreign markets, because the global corporations, they don't care if the dollar goes down, they're moving into the Euro, and moving into other currencies, and they've got the slave labor factories that they've used to leverage out all competition in the U.S.
[02:41:13.863 --> 02:41:15.304]  to consolidate power here!
[02:41:15.384 --> 02:41:16.546]  It's economic warfare!
[02:41:16.766 --> 02:41:22.772]  They go to these slave nations, use their hundreds of millions of slaves to build products so cheap no one could ever compete with it,
[02:41:23.658 --> 02:41:26.461]  Then they flood our markets with it, destroy our industry.
[02:41:26.701 --> 02:41:29.965]  The globalists have special deals made with India and China and others.
[02:41:30.926 --> 02:41:33.689]  And then they come in and buy up everything, lock, stock and barrel.
[02:41:33.729 --> 02:41:35.090]  This is risk.
[02:41:35.551 --> 02:41:36.652]  This is monopoly.
[02:41:36.712 --> 02:41:39.535]  This is predatory.
[02:41:40.997 --> 02:41:42.178]  This is not free market.
[02:41:44.198 --> 02:41:45.079]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:41:45.139 --> 02:41:46.680]  I'll get into some more on Iran.
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:48.861]  Let's go ahead and talk to Will in Texas.
[02:41:48.902 --> 02:41:49.582]  Will, go ahead.
[02:41:49.982 --> 02:41:50.423]  Hey, Alex.
[02:41:50.463 --> 02:41:51.724]  Hey, thanks for having me on your show, man.
[02:41:51.864 --> 02:41:52.484]  Thanks for calling.
[02:41:52.784 --> 02:41:55.086]  Hey, everything I've got to say will take about one minute.
[02:41:55.366 --> 02:42:02.351]  First, I want to say to all the listeners out there, just listening to this show, it's not so much that Alex is just forcing you information.
[02:42:02.391 --> 02:42:03.312]  All this is available.
[02:42:03.332 --> 02:42:05.013]  You can Google everything he talks about.
[02:42:05.814 --> 02:42:09.877]  One of the things I want to say is you can actually Google the words precious metals and stocks.
[02:42:10.672 --> 02:42:20.939]  Or precious metals and investments and look up things that you can do with your money to kind of hedge your protection or protect your money, hedge your bets and your money to keep it from devaluing.
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:24.542]  Also, I urge people to Google the words peak and oil.
[02:42:25.122 --> 02:42:29.105]  Read up on that and learn some interesting things about that that is actually taking place today.
[02:42:30.225 --> 02:42:32.827]  One other thing I want to say is I appreciate what you're doing, Alex.
[02:42:32.867 --> 02:42:39.752]  Guys like you and Michael Berger, I believe that's how you say it, Michael Berger, just how you are just presenting facts
[02:42:40.646 --> 02:42:48.071]  And putting information together, not just, you know, blasting your opinions over the airwaves and just force-feeding people facts.
[02:42:48.151 --> 02:42:49.172]  I appreciate that.
[02:42:49.192 --> 02:42:49.913]  Well, I appreciate it.
[02:42:49.933 --> 02:42:50.933]  I mean, that is the difference.
[02:42:50.994 --> 02:42:55.096]  So many of these other truth shows or patriot shows just blabber their opinions.
[02:42:55.537 --> 02:42:55.797]  Right.
[02:42:56.918 --> 02:42:59.039]  Or just sit around talking about themselves.
[02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:00.160]  It's boring.
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:00.941]  Exactly.
[02:43:00.981 --> 02:43:06.525]  And I mean, I think it's great that you actually suggest to your listening audience to actually do their own research.
[02:43:06.545 --> 02:43:08.606]  You know, read about our Constitution.
[02:43:08.626 --> 02:43:09.687]  Read about our Bill of Rights.
[02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:13.314]  And apply that to what's actually going on in our country.
[02:43:13.374 --> 02:43:14.574]  I mean, that's great that you do that.
[02:43:15.175 --> 02:43:22.377]  Also, I was on your website, InfoWars, and I saw this article about Oklahoma City Sergeant Terrence Yeeke.
[02:43:23.477 --> 02:43:24.458]  Yes, he was murdered.
[02:43:24.858 --> 02:43:25.678]  Yeah, that's terrible.
[02:43:25.918 --> 02:43:34.161]  They actually tried to play that off as a suicide, which is crazy because they described the scene as they found him in his car as
[02:43:35.071 --> 02:43:36.252]  It looked like a slaughterhouse.
[02:43:36.412 --> 02:43:39.733]  Yeah, when they first got there, the police said, there's been a murder, we've got to find the body.
[02:43:40.194 --> 02:43:44.096]  They started searching and he'd been stabbed, I said 13, it was 15 times.
[02:43:44.456 --> 02:43:49.999]  He'd been tortured, he had a rope around his neck, he'd been in handcuffs, and they'd shot him in the back of the head with a silencer.
[02:43:50.679 --> 02:43:58.363]  Yeah, and I, I, how they can pass that off as a suicide is beyond me, but... And his last call to his partner was, I mean, followed by two feds.
[02:43:58.683 --> 02:44:02.665]  Exactly, and I think a lot, and see, I didn't know about that until I saw it on your website.
[02:44:02.725 --> 02:44:04.146]  A lot of people don't know that Sergeant Yickey
[02:44:04.884 --> 02:44:07.186]  He actually should have been considered a national hero.
[02:44:07.226 --> 02:44:10.989]  He was like one of the first officers on the scene at the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:44:11.049 --> 02:44:12.830]  He drug out, you know, I've said dozens.
[02:44:12.890 --> 02:44:15.132]  Colonel Roberts said it was even more than that for hours.
[02:44:15.492 --> 02:44:16.313]  He was a big guy.
[02:44:16.633 --> 02:44:17.434]  He just carried
[02:44:18.263 --> 02:44:21.905]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of people out even though he had a back injury at the time.
[02:44:22.505 --> 02:44:24.266]  And then BATF was there.
[02:44:24.326 --> 02:44:25.687]  He saw him in their bomb gear.
[02:44:25.707 --> 02:44:27.428]  He was the first cop on the scene actually.
[02:44:27.668 --> 02:44:27.868]  Right.
[02:44:27.968 --> 02:44:30.409]  And the BATF admitted they were warned not to go in.
[02:44:30.470 --> 02:44:33.951]  He saw them removing the bombs and he tried to speak out and they killed him.
[02:44:34.312 --> 02:44:35.472]  That is absolutely horrible.
[02:44:35.592 --> 02:44:43.576]  And a bad thing, even worse about that was he was, correct me if I'm wrong, he was set to get a medal of honor just the day before he got slaughtered.
[02:44:44.197 --> 02:44:45.477]  Yes, he was cop of the year.
[02:44:45.497 --> 02:44:46.418]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:54.382]  No, yeah, cop of the year murdered himself, oh yes, and stabbed himself all over.
[02:44:54.402 --> 02:44:56.542]  It's just horrible.
[02:44:57.983 --> 02:45:03.945]  And of course there was, and I've talked to the police officers who worked the case, who witnessed it all, and Colonel Roberts has as well.
[02:45:04.805 --> 02:45:11.127]  I mean, it was obvious struggle, even in handcuffs, a bunch of big men had trouble killing this guy, and they were just stabbing him over and over again.
[02:45:11.147 --> 02:45:12.767]  And he finally just blew his head off.
[02:45:13.896 --> 02:45:16.058]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:45:16.098 --> 02:45:17.759]  Let's talk to Johnny in Vancouver.
[02:45:17.819 --> 02:45:18.539]  Johnny, go ahead.
[02:45:18.879 --> 02:45:19.460]  Hey there, Alex.
[02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:25.063]  I'm wanting to know, did you see the interview with Stephen Colbert and William Crystal?
[02:45:26.244 --> 02:45:26.764]  Yes, I did.
[02:45:27.825 --> 02:45:32.208]  You saw the PNAC discussion, where he was pretty much stunned, didn't know what to say?
[02:45:33.028 --> 02:45:39.112]  Yes, Colbert brings up the fact that PNAC planned the war, planned to stage everything, and then Crystal doesn't know what to say.
[02:45:39.132 --> 02:45:40.793]  Yeah, it was pretty good, actually.
[02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:48.794]  And I also wanted to say your InfoWars address is pretty much a virus now here in Vancouver.
[02:45:48.934 --> 02:45:50.575]  I can't go anywhere without seeing it.
[02:45:51.216 --> 02:45:55.118]  It's from the bathroom stall to bumper stickers just everywhere.
[02:45:55.398 --> 02:45:55.838]  Really?
[02:45:56.018 --> 02:45:58.380]  Yep.
[02:45:58.460 --> 02:46:01.041]  I'll take my little Sharpie into the bathroom and it's already there.
[02:46:01.061 --> 02:46:04.103]  I can't even... I'm beat to the job.
[02:46:04.603 --> 02:46:07.245]  Well, more tagging is
[02:46:08.087 --> 02:46:08.687]  It's horrible.
[02:46:08.727 --> 02:46:09.668]  Please don't do it.
[02:46:10.028 --> 02:46:14.010]  Well, you know, I... You know, we have a government that's carried out terror and is about to carry out more terror.
[02:46:14.390 --> 02:46:17.971]  It's not right to put emergency transmissions on the walls.
[02:46:18.431 --> 02:46:20.752]  Well... No, we shouldn't break the rules.
[02:46:20.772 --> 02:46:21.933]  I think I'll take my chances.
[02:46:22.433 --> 02:46:22.553]  Ha!
[02:46:22.673 --> 02:46:23.954]  I know, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:46:23.994 --> 02:46:24.394]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:25.083 --> 02:46:26.363]  But yeah, keep up the good work.
[02:46:26.744 --> 02:46:27.904]  Alright, God bless you my friend.
[02:46:28.284 --> 02:46:29.024]  That's exciting.
[02:46:29.365 --> 02:46:39.188]  Now I think it's terrible when people climb up on big, vacant buildings from London to... I've been sent photos as far away as New Zealand.
[02:46:39.528 --> 02:46:47.771]  They get up on big, vacant buildings and they spray paint PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com on the side of the building.
[02:46:47.791 --> 02:46:51.873]  It's like they say in Serenity, you can't stop the signal mail.
[02:46:52.373 --> 02:46:53.073]  Can't stop it.
[02:46:53.093 --> 02:46:54.274]  That's what Mr. Universe says.
[02:46:55.174 --> 02:46:56.896]  Oh, it's so exciting what you guys are doing.
[02:46:57.156 --> 02:47:02.601]  I am humbled by the fact that we have so many listeners and so many great people taking action and I appreciate you putting up with me.
[02:47:03.362 --> 02:47:05.163]  Because I know I'm a little bit obnoxious, folks.
[02:47:05.243 --> 02:47:07.465]  I never even wanted to get into all of this, believe me.
[02:47:08.426 --> 02:47:10.148]  I'm actually a leisurely type individual.
[02:47:10.188 --> 02:47:14.712]  I'd rather be out hunting and fishing and hiking and running a business and just enjoying myself.
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.781]  Believe me, I don't want to get off into it.
[02:47:17.821 --> 02:47:20.042]  The point is, I don't like having to work until 2 a.m.
[02:47:20.082 --> 02:47:20.483]  every night.
[02:47:20.943 --> 02:47:21.843]  I've been doing that lately.
[02:47:22.364 --> 02:47:25.345]  But we're not going to survive if we don't, and so I commend you.
[02:47:26.066 --> 02:47:28.507]  Let's talk to Richard and Tehosh.
[02:47:28.687 --> 02:47:29.387]  Go ahead, Richard.
[02:47:29.968 --> 02:47:30.728]  Oh, no, it's Austin.
[02:47:31.008 --> 02:47:35.691]  Yes, I was taking down some notes about a year ago listening to Colonel Don the Grand Prix.
[02:47:36.408 --> 02:47:45.596]  And he was telling the crowd that he went to Rick Gidney's, Major Rick Gidney's award ceremony and watched him receive the award for shooting down Flight 93.
[02:47:46.157 --> 02:47:48.499]  And now he's been made a colonel, yeah.
[02:47:49.139 --> 02:47:52.542]  Okay, so I was wondering, have you tried to contact him to see what he has to say?
[02:47:52.903 --> 02:47:54.384]  Apparently he has the real story.
[02:47:54.584 --> 02:48:00.609]  We have tried to call that airman over and over again, and I've been trying to contact him.
[02:48:00.629 --> 02:48:03.292]  I know that Donna Granpree's been having some heart problems.
[02:48:03.968 --> 02:48:07.830]  I don't like to get off into his personal business, but we'll try to get the Colonel back on.
[02:48:08.811 --> 02:48:09.131]  Oh, okay.
[02:48:09.291 --> 02:48:10.131]  And I have one more thing.
[02:48:10.211 --> 02:48:22.397]  I called the weather modification headquarters, I guess, 901 Congress, K. David Hutchinson's office, and the guy tried to argue with me at first, but I threw out Ben Lennon's number.
[02:48:22.417 --> 02:48:22.778]  Stay there.
[02:48:22.818 --> 02:48:23.818]  I want to hear more about this.
[02:48:24.178 --> 02:48:24.418]  Yeah.
[02:48:24.819 --> 02:48:27.240]  China and the Associated Press cleared the skies.
[02:48:27.941 --> 02:48:30.644]  For rallies and then made it rain to clean dust off the street.
[02:48:31.225 --> 02:48:33.908]  Our own government can start hurricanes and stop hurricanes.
[02:48:33.948 --> 02:48:34.669]  Totally proven.
[02:48:34.949 --> 02:48:35.790]  Back in the 60's.
[02:48:36.331 --> 02:48:39.635]  And Kay Belly's got a big bill for a National Weather Control Board.
[02:48:40.095 --> 02:48:41.337]  To actually control our weather.
[02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:42.238]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:48:44.733 --> 02:48:47.596]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:47.836 --> 02:48:49.418]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:49.758 --> 02:48:54.442]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:54.783 --> 02:48:59.187]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:48:59.627 --> 02:49:03.852]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:04.052 --> 02:49:06.894]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:06.975 --> 02:49:09.477]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:09.657 --> 02:49:11.598]  But the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:11.818 --> 02:49:16.241]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:16.461 --> 02:49:23.685]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:23.945 --> 02:49:26.366]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:49.984]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:50.104 --> 02:49:52.986]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:53.066 --> 02:49:59.791]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:49:59.972 --> 02:50:02.974]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:03.174 --> 02:50:05.556]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:05.696 --> 02:50:10.420]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:25.174]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[02:51:45.746 --> 02:51:51.789]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:52.389 --> 02:51:55.390]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.231 --> 02:51:58.191]  We'll finish up with Richard.
[02:51:58.211 --> 02:52:00.192]  I'll hit a couple of final news articles here.
[02:52:01.693 --> 02:52:02.933]  Richard from Austin, Texas.
[02:52:05.034 --> 02:52:06.835]  Yeah, we talk about weather modification.
[02:52:06.895 --> 02:52:09.376]  I interviewed, you know, the heads of the Navy
[02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:17.155]  Uh, weapons laboratory that were running these operations back in the 60s and 70s and you tell the general public and they go, that's a conspiracy.
[02:52:17.755 --> 02:52:19.216]  No, they could have stopped Katrina.
[02:52:19.316 --> 02:52:20.717]  They could have created Katrina.
[02:52:21.318 --> 02:52:27.402]  Uh, any of that is possible and we know that weather modification groups have contacted them about knocking down the hurricanes.
[02:52:27.782 --> 02:52:31.185]  Now the hurricanes are starting to form again here in the next few months.
[02:52:32.145 --> 02:52:33.526]  The season is with us.
[02:52:33.646 --> 02:52:34.607]  Tis is the season.
[02:52:35.187 --> 02:52:36.568]  And nothing's going to be done again.
[02:52:36.588 --> 02:52:39.930]  And the feds will swoop in and take all our guns as usual.
[02:52:40.411 --> 02:52:41.171]  Go ahead and finish up.
[02:52:41.191 --> 02:52:46.695]  You called Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the Senator's office here in Austin, who's pushing the National Weather Board bill.
[02:52:46.715 --> 02:52:47.075]  Go ahead.
[02:52:47.765 --> 02:52:47.985]  Right.
[02:52:48.025 --> 02:52:57.910]  And the gentleman tried to act like he was still in the developmental stage, so I asked him, you know, about the droughts in Texas and how much damage it was doing and why they wouldn't employ Bill Livingston, I think it was.
[02:52:57.950 --> 02:52:59.731]  He said he has a company that's up and running.
[02:52:59.751 --> 02:53:03.933]  They've been waiting to, you know, assist in getting the cloud seeded so it can run.
[02:53:04.133 --> 02:53:10.057]  And he said, well, other states do it, but the reason why they don't is because they don't think they can control it, you know, starting to stop it.
[02:53:10.097 --> 02:53:11.417]  And it might do more damage.
[02:53:11.437 --> 02:53:16.600]  And I said, well, if other states are doing it, and Scott Stevens and James McKinney, all these
[02:53:17.458 --> 02:53:17.959]  I think so.
[02:53:31.714 --> 02:53:35.575]  Well, what's wrong with trying to give your Senator's aide information?
[02:53:35.836 --> 02:53:39.917]  That's not arguing, it's when he tells you you're wrong, he's the one that's arguing with you!
[02:53:39.937 --> 02:53:53.522]  Right, so I've been duplicating these documents and I've been asking people to call the number and pressure these people to let us know we know what they're capable of and they can start and stop this catastrophe that's destroying the entire city.
[02:53:53.582 --> 02:53:55.703]  Yeah, people should call Kay Bailey Hutchinson and do that.
[02:53:55.743 --> 02:53:56.663]  Thanks for the call, Richard.
[02:53:57.265 --> 02:53:57.925]  Good to hear from you.
[02:53:57.965 --> 02:53:58.646]  That's exciting.
[02:53:58.666 --> 02:53:59.946]  That's what citizens should be doing.
[02:54:00.326 --> 02:54:04.528]  It's old technology and they've done the scientific studies.
[02:54:04.588 --> 02:54:10.750]  It will not cause a problem when a big hurricane is coming in and it could be a category 3, 4, or 5.
[02:54:11.130 --> 02:54:12.790]  It's going to kill thousands of people.
[02:54:12.810 --> 02:54:14.391]  It's going to destroy billions of dollars.
[02:54:14.831 --> 02:54:16.772]  They can go in and just weaken it.
[02:54:17.552 --> 02:54:19.793]  They can weaken it between 30 and 40 percent.
[02:54:19.813 --> 02:54:23.034]  That's what they did in the 60's with just, he said what, 8 aircraft.
[02:54:23.687 --> 02:54:25.789]  Imagine what hundreds of aircraft could do today.
[02:54:25.849 --> 02:54:28.010]  They can totally knock these things out.
[02:54:28.030 --> 02:54:33.775]  But the studies show that might not be completely safe, because it could manipulate total global weather patterns.
[02:54:34.135 --> 02:54:36.156]  But regardless, they're already doing that.
[02:54:36.216 --> 02:54:38.738]  We know the government's manipulating the weather.
[02:54:39.038 --> 02:54:43.522]  We know that's been going on, and it's real, and people need to become aware of it.
[02:54:43.542 --> 02:54:46.244]  So I'm glad that you are aware of that.
[02:54:46.384 --> 02:54:49.206]  I commend you for bringing that up.
[02:54:50.407 --> 02:54:53.309]  Article I didn't get into with as much detail as I wanted to today.
[02:54:53.329 --> 02:54:54.870]  It's on the London Independent.
[02:54:55.450 --> 02:54:58.332]  Electronic smog, the curse of mobile phone age.
[02:54:58.392 --> 02:55:06.037]  Around your home there are countless gadgets whose electrical fields scientists now warn are linked to depression, miscarriage and cancer.
[02:55:06.637 --> 02:55:07.638]  Now we've already known this.
[02:55:07.678 --> 02:55:12.761]  There are hundreds and hundreds of studies by major institutions, universities.
[02:55:13.421 --> 02:55:16.223]  Every week I see a new one about how it causes brain tumors.
[02:55:16.767 --> 02:55:19.129]  Stop putting the cell phone up against your head.
[02:55:19.249 --> 02:55:20.330]  Use a wireless system.
[02:55:20.770 --> 02:55:23.913]  That isn't good for you, but it's nothing compared to that microwave transmitter.
[02:55:24.273 --> 02:55:30.058]  I mean, when a cell phone goes off in my office, all the equipment, the speakers on the computer start squealing and bleeping.
[02:55:30.598 --> 02:55:32.079]  I mean, that's powerful, folks!
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:37.724]  I can bring a big AM transmitter in here and it doesn't do that to the equipment, like these microwave transmitters do.
[02:55:39.846 --> 02:55:41.268]  It admittedly heats the brain!
[02:55:41.669 --> 02:55:46.839]  So we've got some guests coming on about this this week and we'll be covering this a lot more because it's starting to break in the mainstream news.
[02:55:48.135 --> 02:55:54.077]  Please go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get some of my documentary films and the other videos and books we carry.
[02:55:54.278 --> 02:55:57.399]  They're excellent, they'll wake people up, and it supports the broadcast.
[02:55:57.819 --> 02:56:02.381]  And don't forget, I've got a big 9-11 symposium coming up with videos and great guests.
[02:56:02.441 --> 02:56:04.362]  Two days, jam-packed in LA.
[02:56:04.782 --> 02:56:07.443]  June 24th, 25th, Sheraton downtown.
[02:56:08.003 --> 02:56:11.705]  We've already sold, as of this morning, in just three days, 10% of the tickets.
[02:56:12.995 --> 02:56:14.556]  Ten percent of the tickets are gone!
[02:56:14.996 --> 02:56:16.296]  This thing's in a month and a half!
[02:56:16.756 --> 02:56:17.897]  They're gonna be gone, folks!
[02:56:17.937 --> 02:56:18.757]  You'd better get them!

[02:56:20.858 --> 02:56:21.718]  God bless you all!
