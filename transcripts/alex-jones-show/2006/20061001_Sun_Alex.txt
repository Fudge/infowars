[00:00:01.074 --> 00:00:06.899]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.702]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:12.064]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.485]  Defending our borders.
[00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:15.567]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:16.848]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:18.830]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.530]  Right.
[00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:21.612]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:27.257]  This is the Alex Jones Show on News Radio 590 KLVJ.
[00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:32.020]  Call Alex now at 836-0590, pound 590 for those on a wireless, and call free at 1-877-590-KLVJ.
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.721]  Now, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:48.494]  Welcome, my friends, listening here in Central Texas and all over the country.
[00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:56.800]  We're coming to you live from the studios of News Radio 590 KLBJ, deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas, to be exact.
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.001]  I'm excited today.
[00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.262]  We're testing out the syndication.
[00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:04.305]  We're already going nationwide and worldwide up on the big ABC Star Guide satellite.
[00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.848]  In the next few weeks, we will officially be syndicating this broadcast across the country.
[00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:12.511]  Already have a long list of A&M affiliates that are wishing to pick it up.
[00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:14.284]  We're very thankful for that.
[00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:21.008]  It is October 1st, 2006 on this beautiful Sunday afternoon, at least here in Central Texas.
[00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.110]  It is a picturesque, delicious day.
[00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.991]  And we thank you for joining us.
[00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.332]  Let me give you a rundown of what's coming up.
[00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:36.959]  Other than your phone calls, which we always invite, toll free at 877-590-KLBJ or toll free locally, of course, 836-0590 or pound 590.
[00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.221]  It's a free call for singular wireless customers.
[00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:47.876]  I told one of my writers that we were collaborating on a Friday writing a story.
[00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:53.463]  I said, why don't we give it the headline, The Day America Died and Dictatorship Was Born.
[00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:57.569]  And that is similar to the headline that we did come up with.
[00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:03.169]  Torture Bill states non-allegiance to Bush is terrorism.
[00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.993]  Legislation tolls the bell for the day America died, the birth of the dictatorship.
[00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:13.656]  And I'm not embellishing, we're not exaggerating when we say that.
[00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.818]  I'm not saying that the United States cannot be resurrected.
[00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.384]  But this officially overturned the entire first ten amendments to the Bill of Rights, officially.
[00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:35.715]  At the very same time, they passed a law, now going to Bush's desk on Monday, that totally ends the Fourth Amendment and says unlimited total spying on the American people.
[00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:49.129]  And I've actually read both the bills, and I was pleasantly pleased to notice that the New York Times, the LA Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, the BBC, the Times of London, the Tokyo Times,
[00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:52.289]  All did a true analysis of this.
[00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.150]  In the past with Patriot Act 1 or 2, it would take them six months, a year to even get half of it right.
[00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.570]  This time they got it right and they're saying the end of the country.
[00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.251]  And this is the end.
[00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:04.711]  The United States is the United States because we have something nobody else had.
[00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:06.152]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:09.412]  It is now officially gone.
[00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:16.134]  And there's a big hoax going on from the White House telling everyone that this only affects foreigners.
[00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:17.276]  That is a lie.
[00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:20.777]  We will cover the mainstream news, which is accurately reporting this is for U.S.
[00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:23.338]  citizens, and then I'll actually read the subsections of the bill.
[00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:26.139]  I think it's important that this does not become partisan.
[00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.480]  The Democrats voted for this as well.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.381]  100 to 1 in the Senate.
[00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:38.203]  100% voted for this, showing you again the bizarre Orwellian nature of this.
[00:03:38.263 --> 00:03:44.325]  This is horrifying, but they know when Hillary's in, or Governor Warner of Virginia, that's probably who you're going to have,
[00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:45.153]  I don't
[00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:00.304]  We're good to go.
[00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:21.469]  In the House.
[00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:28.111]  We'll end all the rumors and disinformation the media has been putting out about this and we'll give you the actual facts.
[00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:31.492]  Though a lot of the media now is reporting the truth days after it passed.
[00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:32.832]  They've now had a chance to read it.
[00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:33.752]  That's another problem.
[00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:36.373]  The final version of the bill was done on Wednesday.
[00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:37.493]  It was passed on Friday.
[00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:39.874]  So the media hadn't read the 80 page bill.
[00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:42.394]  But we have now, my friends.
[00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:43.615]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:47.017]  Also, I wouldn't normally talk about a sex scandal.
[00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:48.738]  I didn't talk about JonBenet Ramsey.
[00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:50.179]  I didn't talk about O.J.
[00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.760]  Simpson.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.981]  I didn't talk about the poor girl in Aruba.
[00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:54.302]  I see these as distractions.
[00:04:54.702 --> 00:05:00.326]  But this story with Representative Mark Foley, the Republican, is not a diversion.
[00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:29.567]  is not a distraction if you really uh... look at it closely the way the media and the republicans and democrats are using it is just a bunch of mudslinging and is a diversion but if you know about and if you have a memory and if you studied this well you learn that basically the republican party predominantly uh... in congress at the federal level is a homosexual cult and uh... folks I have mainstream news here reporting on this even
[00:05:31.044 --> 00:05:42.131]  Vanity Fair and several other big magazines, what, last year, had this big headline, Gay Republicans, and it talked about how, why is it that so many of them get caught?
[00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:51.056]  They get caught in bathrooms together, they get caught in bathhouses together, they're constantly caught raping children, and I have a giant list of them here.
[00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:54.178]  I'm going to be writing a big article about this late tonight when I finally
[00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:56.166]  Get some time for tomorrow.
[00:05:56.206 --> 00:06:03.970]  I know several of my writers, Paul Watson and Steve Watson, as well as Ryan Slickheisen, I also charged them Friday with writing a big report on this.
[00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.971]  But we will go over it for you.
[00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:10.373]  Of course, Mr. Foley also co-chaired the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children.
[00:06:10.973 --> 00:06:14.995]  As I've warned you, we're not saying police officers are all pedophiles.
[00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:16.856]  We're not saying truancy officers are all pedophiles.
[00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:19.277]  We're not saying that school teachers are all pedophiles.
[00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:22.519]  But statistically, conservatively,
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.680]  Statistically.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.161]  Because you can find statistics that show it's worse.
[00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:27.663]  But conservatively, five times more likely.
[00:06:28.424 --> 00:06:34.748]  Because smart pedophiles, again, like to join these groups, these organizations, where they have contact with children.
[00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:36.790]  And the media is trying to build this as a sex scandal.
[00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.532]  No, this is a pervert scandal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:45.115]  It's now come out, of course, Dennis Hatchard and others knew that Foley was going after pages as young as 14.
[00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:47.697]  They knew all about the emails.
[00:06:47.717 --> 00:06:49.479]  They knew about it almost a year ago.
[00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.220]  And they kept it quiet.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.721]  And the Democratic challenger,
[00:06:53.613 --> 00:07:17.332]  Back on Thursday went public and said, I demand that there be some major investigations on this, and the Washington Post called him a conspiracy theorist, and the Speaker of the House, Hastert of Illinois, came out and said, how dare you, no one's heard of this, this is all just political, and now we have these disgusting emails that I will not read on air.
[00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:20.875]  And of course, you've got this fake Christian, this fake conservative,
[00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:32.318]  I mean, if they're not on cocaine and heroin and over-the-counter or prescription drugs, they're in the bathhouses, they're at the porno parlors.
[00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:39.767]  Folks, I have in front of me a list of over a hundred Republicans caught, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:42.034 --> 00:07:44.556]  Gay sex scandal rocked Spokane.
[00:07:44.956 --> 00:07:48.479]  Mayor denies he abused boys in the 70's or misused his office.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.303]  Republican sex scandals and it just goes on and on and on.
[00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:59.768]  I have ten pages of it where each scandal is just one little two-line entry.
[00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:04.052]  Ten pages of it here in front of me.
[00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.835]  Oh, I always like this New York Post article.
[00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:13.578]  Top gay porn star serviced Republican moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:26.664]  And I like the AP report and the People Magazine report I had back from the 80s about the big buses bussing in all of the top gay prostitutes for the Christian, conservative, Republican leaders.
[00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:29.105]  Of course, I snuck into Bohemian Grove, my friends, back in 2000.
[00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:31.586]  First and only person to ever do that.
[00:08:31.626 --> 00:08:36.689]  Made a film about it and it's aired all over national Japanese, British, German TV, and now on national U.S.
[00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:37.129]  television.
[00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.448]  What, last time I checked, 25 times.
[00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:42.450]  It's the most aired program in Trio Network history.
[00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.411]  Because they got such a response from it.
[00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:47.253]  And yeah, that's basically all I saw for the five hours I was in there.
[00:08:47.273 --> 00:08:50.015]  And I had old men hitting on me the entire time.
[00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:52.336]  And listen, that's their lifestyle.
[00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:53.137]  That's their business.
[00:08:53.597 --> 00:08:56.299]  The point is, they want to run around grandstanding.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.284]  I mean, that's one thing if it's, you know, well, I guess it is illegal, though, to have the gay porn stars there and have them servicing them.
[00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:06.233]  I guess it isn't really their business.
[00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:20.482]  But the point is, these are guys that all vote for laws to imprison American citizens if they're caught with prostitutes, and they're heading up the exploited children networks, which is our business, and then are busy trying to exploit children.
[00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:32.169]  So after we get back from break, we will get into the incredible draconian legislation that passed, two pieces of it Friday, going to the President's desk next week.
[00:09:33.116 --> 00:09:37.118]  We will get into more details with Representative Mark Pervert Foley.
[00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:38.978]  He's admitted to all of his perverted activities.
[00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:42.419]  And then the new laughing 9-11 video.
[00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:43.880]  The 9-11 bomber videos.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.800]  Totally fake.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.380]  We'll prove it.
[00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:48.481]  Al Gore's out shilling, lying about global warming.
[00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:49.502]  It's really global tax.
[00:09:49.982 --> 00:09:53.603]  It's all coming up from the studios of News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:09:53.623 --> 00:09:55.684]  And I see the phone lines are loading up as well.
[00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:56.704]  We'll take your calls.
[00:09:57.404 --> 00:09:58.025]  Stay with us.
[00:09:58.065 --> 00:09:58.705]  We'll be right back.
[00:10:03.806 --> 00:10:04.267]  It's here!
[00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:09.271]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:17.297]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.977 --> 00:10:25.023]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.443 --> 00:10:32.329]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:10:32.802 --> 00:10:36.844]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:40.666]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:43.027]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:47.269]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:06.484]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:11:06.944 --> 00:11:14.706]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:22.909]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:27.994]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:11:28.315 --> 00:11:33.040]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.405]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:38.906]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:11:38.986 --> 00:11:43.011]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.937]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:01.762]  Terrorism!
[00:12:01.942 --> 00:12:02.663]  Terrorism!
[00:12:02.783 --> 00:12:08.845]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:12:09.105 --> 00:12:10.706]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:13.427]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:12:13.807 --> 00:12:28.373]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:28.733]  government.
[00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:30.694]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:12:31.074 --> 00:12:36.996]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:41.618]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:03.198]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.480]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:12.706]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:13:12.946 --> 00:13:21.473]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.325]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:13:54.365 --> 00:13:56.026]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:14:10.714 --> 00:14:14.839]  Every Sunday, right here from the studios of NewsRadio 590K, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:21.747]  I know we've already got Antone, Greg, Mark, and many others who are patiently holding, and I'm going to get to you here in just a few minutes.
[00:14:22.348 --> 00:14:26.373]  But before this hour elapses, I am going to detail for you
[00:14:27.412 --> 00:14:32.136]  Or detail for you, the incredible legislation.
[00:14:32.216 --> 00:14:43.404]  I've never seen anything like this in all my years studying legislation, in all my years covering what happens on Capitol Hill, what the Congress does, what the President pushes, the legislation he brings to them.
[00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:44.905]  This is unbelievable.
[00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:49.289]  This overturns the Bill of Rights wholesale.
[00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:53.172]  Now, again, the Supreme Court a hundred and something years ago said black people weren't human beings.
[00:14:53.212 --> 00:14:53.992]  What was that, almost 180 years ago?
[00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:58.154]  And the Supreme Court has ruled that black people were slaves.
[00:14:58.174 --> 00:14:59.295]  It doesn't mean we have to follow it.
[00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:02.577]  Congress has passed laws saying that Indians didn't have any rights.
[00:15:02.897 --> 00:15:05.098]  We now know those laws were really null and void.
[00:15:05.818 --> 00:15:11.021]  And the same Congress passed laws saying that blacks couldn't drink out of water fountains, that whites could.
[00:15:11.441 --> 00:15:20.846]  And so I tell Bush and the rest of the criminals up there in DC, we're not going to follow this and our Bill of Rights and our Constitution is still in effect even if you despots try to remove it.
[00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:23.207]  Let me just read to you what the
[00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:29.777]  Law professor Bruce Ackerman stated in the LA Times, quote, Well, that's putting it lightly.
[00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:47.879]  What did the Associated Press report?
[00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:57.487]  The subsection of the definition of unlawful enemy combatant means that if the Pentagon says you're an unlawful enemy combatant using whatever criteria they wish, then as far as Congress and the U.S.
[00:15:57.507 --> 00:16:02.792]  law is concerned, you are one, whether or not you have any connection to hostilities at all.
[00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:05.434]  Actually, Friday I read the bill.
[00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:06.635]  I read it again yesterday.
[00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:09.677]  I read a lot of it Thursday night as it was set to pass.
[00:16:09.717 --> 00:16:11.738]  We finally got the final version of it.
[00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.860]  And I found something far worse than it.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.521]  We'll tell you about that after this next break that's coming up.
[00:16:16.682 --> 00:16:22.906]  We'll read the actual subsection, which states that any non-allegiance to what Bush says
[00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:27.537]  You will be secretly arrested, secretly tried, and can be secretly executed.
[00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:29.617]  And we will give you the actual subsection.
[00:16:29.637 --> 00:16:32.838]  Then they lie on TV and radio and say this doesn't affect U.S.
[00:16:32.878 --> 00:16:33.238]  citizens.
[00:16:33.638 --> 00:16:35.539]  Well, it's when they arrest you, you're stripped of U.S.
[00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:36.179]  citizenship.
[00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:40.060]  Just by order of the President or any of his designates.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.500]  Or any of the Secretary of Defense's designates.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.841]  And then we'll also get into the Foley scandal, the pervert scandal in Congress.
[00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:55.511]  We'll get into this new video right on time for the election of supposed Mohammed Adda up there laughing, but oh, there's no audio of it on the tape.
[00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:59.572]  Next we'll see another fat bin Laden tape, another fake bin Laden tape.
[00:16:59.772 --> 00:17:02.112]  I want to go over why this is fake and why we know it's fake.
[00:17:02.452 --> 00:17:04.953]  And then Al Gore is out shilling for a global tax.
[00:17:04.973 --> 00:17:05.773]  And you're like, wait a minute.
[00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:11.535]  I heard Al Gore was out shilling Mr. Jones to save us from global warming.
[00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.937]  Folks, when you hear global warming, it means global tax.
[00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:15.818]  I agree with Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma.
[00:17:15.978 --> 00:17:23.903]  This is a giant hoax, and Al Gore is nothing but a globalist minion, an errand boy, trying to scam you into a global tax.
[00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:29.007]  And by the way, he's out saying tax cigarettes globally, because they're causing global warming.
[00:17:29.407 --> 00:17:30.648]  And I don't like cigarettes, folks.
[00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:32.789]  They're deadly, they're bad, but that's people's right.
[00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.652]  And to say that they're causing global warming, just like they claim the flatulence of cows.
[00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:39.188]  It looks like Mark could be someone who disagrees.
[00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:39.708]  Does he disagree?
[00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:42.972]  It doesn't say on my screen, but it says, questions about your reporting.
[00:17:57.483 --> 00:18:03.608]  So, well, people need to tell us if they disagree, because unlike other talk show hosts who are afraid, we put you to the head of the line.
[00:18:03.648 --> 00:18:04.689]  Plus, it makes for better radio.
[00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:12.935]  Then we'll get to Antone about sexual scandals on the Hill, that's the Capitol, and Greg in New Jersey on a bunch of other issues.
[00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:16.357]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Mark in North Austin.
[00:18:16.758 --> 00:18:19.139]  You're on News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.740]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:21.581]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:18:21.882 --> 00:18:22.522]  Hey bro, what's up?
[00:18:23.423 --> 00:18:26.125]  Hey, I'm calling on behalf of somebody that
[00:18:26.943 --> 00:18:29.244]  Really wouldn't have the guts to call you.
[00:18:30.405 --> 00:18:31.886]  I've been listening to you for years.
[00:18:33.587 --> 00:18:55.540]  And I mean, I don't disagree with you, but it seems like the more I try to spread the truth, I keep getting the same, well, he's just picking the half-truths and all this stuff is, I mean, you could turn it any way you want to, just nitpick the story and turn it to your advantage, and I'm like,
[00:18:56.181 --> 00:18:58.443]  Well, you know, the story is the story.
[00:18:59.944 --> 00:19:05.049]  Laws are being passed to basically subvert our rights.
[00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:06.891]  Well, this is what frustrates me.
[00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:08.472]  When I say that U.S.
[00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:20.903]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B states that for experimental reasons our government can kill us with chemical, biological, or radiological
[00:19:24.741 --> 00:19:27.208]  I'm not making that up.
[00:19:27.269 --> 00:19:27.630]  It's there.
[00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:29.776]  When I say, when I get up on air
[00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:32.466]  And I say that H.R.
[00:19:32.486 --> 00:19:36.429]  6166 in the House, and the Senate version was H.R.
[00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:37.970]  6054, states that it's U.S.
[00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:38.390]  citizens.
[00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.051]  You know, I said that Friday morning.
[00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:45.815]  And it wasn't until Friday night, Saturday, that the mainstream news finally read it and said, yeah, it affects U.S.
[00:19:45.855 --> 00:19:46.195]  citizens.
[00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:48.116]  Days before that, they were saying it didn't.
[00:19:48.377 --> 00:19:52.159]  Last weekend, I was on air with the previous version saying it affected U.S.
[00:19:52.199 --> 00:19:52.559]  citizens.
[00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:53.220]  Last Sunday.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.261]  So I don't make any of this up, brother.
[00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:56.762]  Believe me, I wish it wasn't true.
[00:19:57.102 --> 00:20:03.949]  I mean, I've got guard dogs at my house and my wife is afraid when I'm not there at night of the New World Order.
[00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:05.110]  We take this serious.
[00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.511]  We believe what we're saying.
[00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:09.975]  I'm freaked out about where this country is going.
[00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:13.258]  Just tell your friends who are doubting me, hey, it's good to doubt.
[00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:16.361]  But if they doubt me, they better doubt the mainstream media.
[00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:20.064]  And I tell them to go check it out for themselves.
[00:20:20.942 --> 00:20:25.724]  You've said this before, they're willingly ignorant.
[00:20:25.784 --> 00:20:26.984]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[00:20:27.044 --> 00:20:28.425]  Willfully ignorant, I should say.
[00:20:28.445 --> 00:20:29.625]  How long have you been listening?
[00:20:29.805 --> 00:20:32.246]  For probably close to about ten years.
[00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:35.587]  How long have I talked about the Republican leadership being a homosexual cult?
[00:20:41.428 --> 00:20:48.092]  Well, I mean, I've been talking about the scandals, they're endless, usually they don't get attention, like this polling thing.
[00:20:48.112 --> 00:20:53.795]  What woke me up was when you started showing the cover-up in Oklahoma City, that kind of opened my eyes.
[00:20:54.455 --> 00:21:02.940]  And then, of course, after 9-11, I was like, well, I think Alex has gone off the deep end this time, but as time goes on and evidence comes out,
[00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:06.618]  I mean, you've been right on target the whole time.
[00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:12.683]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call, and I'm sorry you're having trouble with your friend, but let the dead bury the dead.
[00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:14.464]  Dust off your feet, as Christ said.
[00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:16.246]  Don't throw your pearls before swine.
[00:21:16.866 --> 00:21:17.947]  Just don't waste your time.
[00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:21.270]  If somebody wants to argue with you, that's fine.
[00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:26.354]  If they really want to debate, and they really want to see info, and they really want to find the truth, then spend your time arguing.
[00:21:26.374 --> 00:21:28.075]  But if they just go, no, I'm not going to check the facts.
[00:21:28.356 --> 00:21:29.737]  No, Northwoods doesn't exist.
[00:21:30.017 --> 00:21:30.938]  By the way, speak of the devil.
[00:21:31.278 --> 00:21:38.822]  Here's a little clip from my interview with Jesse Ventura, the former governor, and of course, the former Navy SEAL and professional wrestler and movie star and all that.
[00:21:39.102 --> 00:21:41.843]  I had a sit-down interview with him earlier this week.
[00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:45.165]  It's up for free on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:45.185 --> 00:21:46.005]  It's a 20-minute interview.
[00:21:46.245 --> 00:21:48.867]  But I'm going to air about five minutes of it in the next hour.
[00:21:49.047 --> 00:21:50.968]  But here's a short clip of what he talked about with me.
[00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:58.051]  Well, I think the most interesting thing to talk about today is if people aren't aware that due to the
[00:22:00.832 --> 00:22:02.313]  Freedom of Information Act.
[00:22:02.994 --> 00:22:07.897]  In the early 60s, the Pentagon had an operation called Operation Northwoods.
[00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:22.686]  And it never came to reality, but it was on the table, that our military would attack certain cities within the United States and make it look like Cuba did it to justify an invasion of Cuba.
[00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:29.241]  Well, there you have about 30 seconds of my 20-minute interview that I got with Mr. Ventura.
[00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:33.424]  We'll play about five minutes of some of the highlights of it, coming up in the next hour.
[00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:38.867]  But when we get back, we're going to go to Antone, Greg, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:22:39.947 --> 00:22:46.110]  And we will then get into details on the two pieces of legislation that passed the House and Senate on Friday.
[00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:49.112]  Coming up on the other side, stay with us.

[00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.292]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[00:25:33.393 --> 00:25:35.374]  A tornado under your hood!
[00:25:35.394 --> 00:25:40.939]  Tornado is an easy to install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:48.405]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:53.389]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[00:25:53.569 --> 00:25:58.773]  Visit TornadoAir.com or go to Pep Boys, Napa, or AutoZone today.
[00:26:00.054 --> 00:26:04.101]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:26:04.322 --> 00:26:07.728]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:26:07.908 --> 00:26:11.354]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:14.885]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:20.366]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:30.028]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:26:30.148 --> 00:26:31.449]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:26:31.469 --> 00:26:36.930]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:26:37.347 --> 00:26:43.334]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[00:26:43.494 --> 00:26:46.958]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:26:46.978 --> 00:26:48.239]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:27:05.962 --> 00:27:10.846]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:10.886 --> 00:27:14.728]  Nationwide from the studios of News Radio 590 KLBJ in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:15.109 --> 00:27:16.330]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.472]  The toll-free number to join us all over the nation is 877-590-KLBJ or 877-590-5525.
[00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:22.394]  Locally, 836-0590 or toll-free for singular wireless customers, pound 590.
[00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:27.438]  We'll get you up and on the air here in just a few minutes, so be patient.
[00:27:37.215 --> 00:27:51.663]  You heard right before the break a little clip of the former governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, who told me that things have gotten so bad in the United States that he has actually moved to Baja, Mexico, and has basically given up.
[00:27:51.683 --> 00:27:53.264]  That's what he said at the end of the interview.
[00:27:53.605 --> 00:28:04.211]  But at the first of the interview, he talked about some of the reasons he has left, and you can go to PrisonPlanet.com if you'd like later and watch the entire 20-minute video taped interview, but we're going to play some of that audio later in the next hour.
[00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:05.052]  He said that
[00:28:05.852 --> 00:28:11.719]  Our government could have been involved in 9-11 because he saw the staged Gulf of Tonkin now declassified to get us into Vietnam.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.286]  He knows that the NORAD stood down 9-11, but the main reason was Operation Northwoods.
[00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:22.274]  Official declassified ABC News has reported on, as well as the Baltimore Sun.
[00:28:22.314 --> 00:28:23.055]  We have the document.
[00:28:23.415 --> 00:28:24.176]  An official U.S.
[00:28:24.196 --> 00:28:31.103]  government plan to hijack jets by remote control, just like 9-11, to bomb D.C., to carry out sniper attacks, to attack U.S.
[00:28:31.123 --> 00:28:32.484]  military bases, to kill U.S.
[00:28:32.524 --> 00:28:34.606]  citizens, and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:37.689]  We'll be playing part of that interview with Jesse Ventura.
[00:28:37.729 --> 00:28:39.450]  I'll talk about a few other key issues as well.
[00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:43.014]  Late in the second hour, so you'll want to stay with us.
[00:28:43.394 --> 00:28:44.075]  For that.
[00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:48.538]  Right now, let me get to the top story today, and really detail this for a few minutes, then we'll go to your calls.
[00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:54.081]  Bush given authority, my friends, that no president in U.S.
[00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:55.242]  history has ever had.
[00:28:55.462 --> 00:28:58.624]  Again, the United States is the United States because we have a Bill of Rights, a Constitution.
[00:28:58.644 --> 00:29:00.325]  We're all told this is for terrorists.
[00:29:00.345 --> 00:29:02.647]  This is to keep us safe from Al-Cieda.
[00:29:02.687 --> 00:29:09.451]  Well, even if you believe Al-Qaeda isn't a construct of private defense contractors to attack the U.S.
[00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:13.154]  and other targets for a global war economy so they can have huge profits,
[00:29:13.414 --> 00:29:27.397]  Even if you believe the official fraud that, you know, 19 guys from a cave made NORAD stand down and, you know, get all of this, even if you believe that fraud, you need to go read the bill because this has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:29:27.998 --> 00:29:31.378]  Just like Bush promised that Patriot Act 1 and 2 didn't affect U.S.
[00:29:31.418 --> 00:29:31.798]  citizens.
[00:29:32.239 --> 00:29:35.899]  Now just type into Google, Patriot Act being used in non-terror related cases.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.980]  Thousands nationwide.
[00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.851]  States are using it.
[00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:40.432]  Counties.
[00:29:40.592 --> 00:29:41.012]  Cities.
[00:29:41.392 --> 00:29:42.413]  No due process.
[00:29:42.433 --> 00:29:43.914]  They're saying, well, we can use this.
[00:29:44.175 --> 00:29:48.418]  Well, yes, Section 802 says any crime is an act of terrorism.
[00:29:48.498 --> 00:29:54.783]  Any misdemeanor, any attempted misdemeanor is an act of terrorism in Section 802 of H.R.
[00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:54.783]  3162.
[00:29:55.603 --> 00:29:58.926]  Well, now they've gotten a lot further down the path towards total tyranny.
[00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.087]  Even Hitler
[00:30:01.338 --> 00:30:04.201]  Even Stalin didn't put stuff like this on paper.
[00:30:04.341 --> 00:30:05.582]  They just did it.
[00:30:05.602 --> 00:30:08.424]  Oh, they had all these constitutions with all these flowery terms.
[00:30:08.804 --> 00:30:13.308]  But no one in modern history, no dictator, has ever put it down on paper.
[00:30:13.328 --> 00:30:13.989]  And I want to get
[00:30:14.878 --> 00:30:15.939]  Your response out there.
[00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:19.200]  I want to hear what you think about this legislation.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.621]  So there's no confusion.
[00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:21.521]  This is easy.
[00:30:21.561 --> 00:30:22.762]  Just type it into a search engine.
[00:30:23.262 --> 00:30:24.242]  H.R.
[00:30:24.262 --> 00:30:24.242]  6166.
[00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.063]  That's the House.
[00:30:26.143 --> 00:30:27.224]  House Resolution 6166.
[00:30:28.664 --> 00:30:28.845]  Okay?
[00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:34.687]  Now the one I've marked, the one I focused on, it's identical, is the past H.R.
[00:30:34.707 --> 00:30:36.428]  6054 out of the Senate.
[00:30:36.448 --> 00:30:38.469]  That's the one we got first Thursday night.
[00:30:39.693 --> 00:30:47.564]  And I challenge you to go to PrisonPlanet.com and read the articles, the three articles we've written about this, myself and Paul Watson in collaboration, and to read.
[00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:51.590]  We list the subsection, then we list what it says, and we have a link to the bill.
[00:30:52.071 --> 00:30:52.311]  Okay?
[00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:53.833]  The mainstream media doesn't do that, okay?
[00:30:54.034 --> 00:30:55.576]  They just tell you what a bill says.
[00:30:56.076 --> 00:31:05.101]  And to their credit, they're being a little more honest about this, saying it's the end of posse comitatus, it's the end of habeas corpus, it's the end of the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:05.682 --> 00:31:08.003]  They are saying that.
[00:31:08.183 --> 00:31:13.046]  The New York Times is finally getting off their hind end and saying this is the end of the U.S.
[00:31:13.066 --> 00:31:15.127]  You can go read all those articles on my site.
[00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:18.127]  But I want you to go read this for yourself.
[00:31:18.147 --> 00:31:21.470]  Now remember what Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman said in the LA Times.
[00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:35.620]  The compromise legislation authorizes the President to seize American citizens as enemy combatants even if they have never left the United States and once thrown into military prisons they cannot expect a trial by their peers or any other of the normal protections of the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.200]  And it goes on.
[00:31:37.101 --> 00:31:37.441]  Okay?
[00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:39.823]  Now when you actually read the bill
[00:31:41.293 --> 00:31:48.435]  Starting with Section 950J, it says that federal courts are not allowed to judge this or look at this.
[00:31:48.576 --> 00:31:50.276]  Now, how outrageous is that?
[00:31:50.836 --> 00:31:58.719]  The President is declaring power over the courts and is ordering them by law not to question his new military tribunals over U.S.
[00:31:58.739 --> 00:31:59.159]  citizens.
[00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:05.761]  And simultaneously, I know you've all heard about Gonzales coming out Friday and saying, courts, you do not question this!
[00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:07.842]  The courts are there to watch the
[00:32:08.622 --> 00:32:10.464]  Legislative and executive branch!
[00:32:10.524 --> 00:32:13.647]  The President is announcing dictator powers here!
[00:32:13.948 --> 00:32:16.090]  This is bone-chilling!
[00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:24.418]  But there it is, actually in the bill itself, right out in the open, for everyone to see.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.223]  And again, if you go to our articles, it's just full of hyperlinks to all these other articles.
[00:32:29.263 --> 00:32:31.605]  Every claim we make is documented with a link.
[00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:33.166]  That's something no one else we've seen does.
[00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:34.487]  We do that, okay?
[00:32:34.687 --> 00:32:36.549]  Because truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:37.490]  We know it's hard to believe.
[00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.251]  But then it gets really scary.
[00:32:39.611 --> 00:32:52.903]  When you get into subsection 4B, 26 of section 950V of HR 6166, crimes triable by military commissions, includes the following definition.
[00:32:54.461 --> 00:33:13.762]  Any person subject to this sub-chapter who, in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States, knowingly and intentionally aids an enemy of the United States, or who aids co-belligerents of the enemy, shall be punished, as a military commission under this chapter may direct, including death.
[00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:16.189]  Now, did you hear that?
[00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:20.810]  Now, this is a section that the lawyers have looked at, and there's actually four of them in there, but this is the one the media picked up on.
[00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:40.434]  It's saying if you don't have allegiance to the government, and it lists that in the sub-definitions as the executive branch of the president or his designate, you can be secretly arrested, secretly tried by a kangaroo court, where there's double jeopardy, even if the tribunal finds you not guilty, they can still hold you, they can use evidence from torture, but they now
[00:33:41.094 --> 00:33:42.954]  Redefine it as pressure.
[00:33:43.295 --> 00:33:44.735]  I mean, this is so Orwellian.
[00:33:44.775 --> 00:33:46.655]  This is so off the charts.
[00:33:46.775 --> 00:33:50.456]  I'm challenging you to not just say, oh, that's Alex saying that.
[00:33:50.756 --> 00:33:53.517]  I challenge you to go read this subsection.
[00:33:53.537 --> 00:33:54.237]  We've made it easy.
[00:33:54.457 --> 00:33:57.738]  We've got all the subsections here within links to the Library of Congress.
[00:33:57.998 --> 00:34:00.038]  We don't expect you to believe this even off our own site.
[00:34:00.218 --> 00:34:00.979]  We make the claim.
[00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:02.259]  We have a link to the subsection.
[00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:03.379]  Now, you go look at it.
[00:34:03.399 --> 00:34:06.660]  This is what Hitler and Stalin did, but they didn't put it in writing.
[00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:10.397]  I mean, literally, folks, this has got me and my wife talking about leaving the country.
[00:34:10.978 --> 00:34:11.798]  And nothing ever has.
[00:34:11.838 --> 00:34:17.920]  I mean, we're openly saying, my gosh, are we going to end up being like the Jews who didn't get out of Germany and laughed at their cousins who did leave?
[00:34:18.521 --> 00:34:24.103]  I mean, folks, we're actually, and I've sworn I would never abandon ship, but I may get my family out of here.
[00:34:24.323 --> 00:34:31.086]  I mean, if somebody doesn't put the brakes on this, if somebody doesn't say no to this, if people don't start waking up, this is America!
[00:34:31.286 --> 00:34:34.327]  They just flushed the Bill of Rights down the toilet!
[00:34:36.168 --> 00:34:36.808]  Oh my gosh.
[00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:44.326]  And it says in here, if you aid someone who aids a terrorist, even unknowingly, you can be secretly arrested.
[00:34:44.367 --> 00:34:46.929]  It says if you destroy anyone's property, any U.S.
[00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:48.410]  government property, you're a terrorist.
[00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:51.913]  It lists just everything in here.
[00:34:51.973 --> 00:34:53.533]  This is the Alien and Sedition Act.
[00:34:53.734 --> 00:34:55.074]  The New York Times wouldn't have looked at this.
[00:34:55.094 --> 00:34:59.897]  It was a law passed in the end of World War I that said if you criticize the government, you could be arrested and thrown in prison until the end of the war.
[00:35:00.377 --> 00:35:02.758]  Well, this is even worse than that, okay?
[00:35:03.339 --> 00:35:04.879]  This is unbelievable.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:11.563]  And then, as if that isn't bad enough, they passed another bill saying, Friday, and the AP reported,
[00:35:12.558 --> 00:35:15.383]  Wiretap bill sets up the end of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:35:15.843 --> 00:35:20.590]  The House approved a bill Thursday that would grant legal status to President Bush's warrantless wiretapping program.
[00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:21.492]  You hear that?
[00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:26.159]  Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, which is over the entire United States.
[00:35:27.841 --> 00:35:28.082]  Folks,
[00:35:28.718 --> 00:35:30.299]  This is the end of our country.
[00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:31.979]  What do you think about this?
[00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:33.740]  877-590-KLBJ, locally 836-059.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.620]  We're going to break.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:42.842]  We're going to come back and go straight to your calls on this subject, and then later we'll get into this congressman, this Republican congressman pervert.
[00:35:43.062 --> 00:35:55.126]  Type in Republican sex scandal into Google, and you will get hundreds of mainstream reports of governors and two of the deputy heads of Homeland Security in the last six months grabbing children, going after children.
[00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:57.127]  I mean, it's just all over the news.
[00:35:59.028 --> 00:36:01.630]  I can't believe these people are so criminal.
[00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.450]  But what do you expect?
[00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:07.534]  If they're going to butcher America in the Bill of Rights and use terrorism as a pretext, of course there are going to be a bunch of sickos.
[00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:12.097]  And every time, they're involved in some children's charity or to protect children.
[00:36:12.778 --> 00:36:14.579]  It's unbelievable!
[00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:16.900]  I mean, who can believe what this Foley guy is doing?
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.741]  He's admitted to it!
[00:36:18.562 --> 00:36:20.463]  It gets much worse than that.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:30.189]  So when we get back on the other side of this quick break, we will get into all of it right here on News Radio 590KLBJ, which again is syndicated right now.
[00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:32.131]  We're doing the big test on the satellites today.
[00:36:32.651 --> 00:36:33.972]  Next week, the final big test.
[00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:35.254]  We're going to tell all the stations about it.
[00:36:35.274 --> 00:36:38.297]  It will be syndicated all over the country within two weeks.
[00:36:38.657 --> 00:36:42.461]  I am excited, and Trey is riding shotgun in there with me right now.
[00:36:43.149 --> 00:36:46.554]  We may be on the deck of the Titanic here in the U.S., but we're not going down without a fight.
[00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:50.039]  We're defending this republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:36:50.379 --> 00:36:56.507]  We'll also get into the new 9-11 tape of the supposedly Mohammed Ada being released, and Al Gore's fraud about global warming.
[00:36:56.728 --> 00:36:57.549]  It's all coming up.
[00:36:57.809 --> 00:36:58.210]  Stay with us.
[00:37:02.699 --> 00:37:06.820]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:08.801]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:15.363]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:37:15.644 --> 00:37:21.766]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:28.028]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:37:28.328 --> 00:37:34.734]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:37:34.874 --> 00:37:38.418]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:37:38.718 --> 00:37:42.441]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:45.164]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:37:45.284 --> 00:37:46.345]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:47.646]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:37:47.806 --> 00:37:50.589]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[00:37:50.609 --> 00:37:51.049]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.129]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:02.186]  Come on, Bill.
[00:38:02.386 --> 00:38:07.568]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:09.388]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:38:09.488 --> 00:38:11.469]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:17.271]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:23.812]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:38:24.132 --> 00:38:26.353]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:38:26.613 --> 00:38:27.933]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:38:30.294 --> 00:38:30.715]  Whoa!
[00:38:31.095 --> 00:38:32.296]  What was that website again?
[00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:35.859]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:37.281]  Now write this down, John.
[00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:41.725]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:38:41.865 --> 00:38:42.445]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:38:42.725 --> 00:38:43.927]  I'm going there right now.
[00:38:44.327 --> 00:38:45.008]  Check, please.
[00:38:46.789 --> 00:38:48.230]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:38:48.711 --> 00:38:49.291]  Sure, John.
[00:38:49.532 --> 00:38:53.896]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:54.196 --> 00:38:55.877]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:38:56.038 --> 00:38:56.298]  Deal.
[00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:07.054]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:39:07.395 --> 00:39:09.336]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:39:09.716 --> 00:39:17.382]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:39:18.062 --> 00:39:25.107]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:39:25.507 --> 00:39:32.412]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.971]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:39:37.231 --> 00:39:40.692]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:39:41.192 --> 00:39:43.113]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:39:43.453 --> 00:39:47.354]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:41:13.246 --> 00:41:15.828]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:29.117]  Give Alex a piece of your mind at 836-0590, pound 590 for those on a wireless, and toll free at 1-877-590-KLBJ.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.361]  Alright, we're going to go to your calls.
[00:41:34.961 --> 00:41:35.682]  One of the callers.
[00:41:37.366 --> 00:41:38.668]  The name, I guess, is 666.
[00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:45.560]  He wants to say, hey, the name of the new bill butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution that just passed Friday butchers going to sign next week is 666.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.882]  It is 6-6-1-6, not technically 6-6-6.
[00:41:50.262 --> 00:41:52.683]  We'll talk to Antone, Greg, Angel, Steppenwolf.
[00:41:53.003 --> 00:41:56.385]  We've got calls from Utah, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Hawaii.
[00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:57.766]  What's going on here?
[00:41:57.806 --> 00:41:59.366]  This is like out of control.
[00:42:00.507 --> 00:42:03.569]  But before we get to your calls, I was listening to a promo.
[00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:07.851]  I don't want to change subjects, but I was listening to a promo for one of the local KLBJ shows.
[00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:14.876]  About down in Houston how they pledge allegiance to the Mexican flag on Mexican Independence Day and everybody's discovered this and is freaking out.
[00:42:15.256 --> 00:42:15.876]  Hey folks!
[00:42:16.337 --> 00:42:21.240]  El Cenizo for ten years flies the Mexican flag in South Texas.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.922]  The courthouse flies the Mexican flag.
[00:42:24.282 --> 00:42:26.283]  English is not allowed in court proceedings.
[00:42:26.604 --> 00:42:31.307]  That was in the San Antonio Express News eight, nine years ago when I first learned of it, okay?
[00:42:32.187 --> 00:42:34.129]  It gets a lot worse than that.
[00:42:34.949 --> 00:42:37.431]  And then on top of it, my friends,
[00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:48.464]  It just came out that they had their North American Union meeting secretly two weeks ago in Canada, and at the meeting they were openly talking about giving the Southwest to Mexico.
[00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:53.548]  That's because the global corporations love the thugs that run Mexico.
[00:42:54.068 --> 00:42:55.849]  They have tripled the resources we have.
[00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:57.649]  They have more billionaires than the U.S.
[00:42:57.749 --> 00:42:58.309]  even has.
[00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.570]  Their people are total slaves.
[00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:01.990]  And the elite loves that model.
[00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.131]  Just like they love the communist Chinese model.
[00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:06.292]  That's why the elite loves China.
[00:43:06.332 --> 00:43:07.472]  Because they oppress their people.
[00:43:07.712 --> 00:43:10.753]  And they're going to use that third world population to break down this country.
[00:43:10.913 --> 00:43:13.654]  They're going to bring them in here to vote for gun control and open borders.
[00:43:14.114 --> 00:43:15.015]  And the end of this country.
[00:43:15.235 --> 00:43:20.178]  You know, Bush talks about arresting anybody who doesn't have an allegiance to his government, any American citizen.
[00:43:20.198 --> 00:43:24.080]  Well, let's arrest people in this government who are pushing for the North American Union.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.301]  You're the traitors!
[00:43:25.841 --> 00:43:26.962]  And you will be exposed.
[00:43:27.002 --> 00:43:28.243]  All right, I promise to go to your calls.
[00:43:29.183 --> 00:43:32.085]  And we will do that now.
[00:43:32.625 --> 00:43:34.026]  I wonder who's been holding the longest here.
[00:43:34.046 --> 00:43:35.767]  I think it's Greg in New Jersey.
[00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:39.109]  Greg, you're on NewsRadio 590K, LBJ, welcome.
[00:43:39.565 --> 00:43:42.886]  Hey Alex, I want to thank you so much for awakening me, I'll tell you that.
[00:43:42.906 --> 00:43:48.247]  I've always been a little suspicious of things ever since, you know, I learned about the JFK conspiracy when I was a kid.
[00:43:48.447 --> 00:43:54.929]  But, to make a long story short, you don't have to be a political scientist or legislator to go through HR 6166.
[00:43:55.949 --> 00:43:57.750]  There is no language in this bill.
[00:43:58.308 --> 00:44:00.631]  It clearly states four times that it's U.S.
[00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:00.892]  citizens.
[00:44:13.168 --> 00:44:17.150]  We have to debate this now, because the White House lied and said it didn't affect U.S.
[00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.192]  citizens, just like they claimed Patriot Act didn't.
[00:44:19.432 --> 00:44:22.254]  But now all the lawyers have looked at it and said, yes, it does.
[00:44:22.274 --> 00:44:23.374]  They've already arrested U.S.
[00:44:23.414 --> 00:44:23.815]  citizens.
[00:44:24.115 --> 00:44:25.956]  Bush has already been doing all this illegally.
[00:44:26.176 --> 00:44:28.898]  He had to get this passed because he'd committed war crimes.
[00:44:29.118 --> 00:44:31.499]  So now our Congress has legalized war crimes.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:36.422]  Well, I tell you what, I'm very, very concerned about this.
[00:44:36.482 --> 00:44:41.225]  But there is some light at the end of the tunnel, because this bill does not nullify U.S.
[00:44:41.265 --> 00:44:41.786]  Code Title 18.
[00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:54.243]  Section 241 which basically says if two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any inhabitant of the United States by intimidating them and blocking their constitutional rights from being fairly executed
[00:44:54.756 --> 00:44:57.117]  Yeah, that's right, that's right.
[00:44:57.197 --> 00:45:03.919]  They can pass laws that are criminal, but it doesn't overturn all the really constitutional laws.
[00:45:03.959 --> 00:45:04.719]  Great to hear from you.
[00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:06.840]  I'm glad that you called us, sir.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.640]  We got Ronnie, and he disagrees and goes ahead of the line.
[00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:15.182]  Don't worry, we're going to get to Greg and Angel and Steppenwolf and Jay and Miami Beach and everybody else, I promise.
[00:45:15.482 --> 00:45:17.963]  We have a rule, people who disagree go ahead of the line.
[00:45:18.516 --> 00:45:27.005]  I served during Vietnam, but to spout some kind of conspiracy behind 9-11 and blowing up buildings and shooting down airplanes or blowing up
[00:45:40.318 --> 00:45:40.819]  Sure.
[00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:43.122]  Let me ask you a question, sir.
[00:45:43.703 --> 00:45:45.005]  You prefaced that without Vietnam.
[00:45:45.025 --> 00:45:48.290]  Does that mean nobody else's opinion matters unless you were in Vietnam?
[00:45:48.731 --> 00:45:49.292]  Absolutely not.
[00:45:49.332 --> 00:45:51.175]  I do disagree with George Bush to an extent.
[00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:57.477]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:45:57.517 --> 00:46:00.878]  You just called in saying I'm a nut, so I'm going to ask you a question right now.
[00:46:01.218 --> 00:46:06.139]  Are you claiming that Bill 6616 doesn't say what I just read and the subsections don't?
[00:46:06.399 --> 00:46:08.520]  Are you claiming there wasn't an official U.S.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.001]  government plan to stage terror attacks in the U.S.?
[00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:12.201]  Are you saying I'm a liar?
[00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:14.232]  I'm saying you're a liar and you're an idiot.
[00:46:14.412 --> 00:46:14.953]  Okay, great!
[00:46:15.113 --> 00:46:17.135]  Hey, why don't you... You know, I'm not a betting man.
[00:46:17.535 --> 00:46:20.938]  But I've done this with national talk show hosts and they call me a liar.
[00:46:20.998 --> 00:46:24.400]  I bet you $10... No, I bet you $100,000!
[00:46:25.401 --> 00:46:28.123]  You put your name down, you announce it, we'll write it down. $100,000!
[00:46:30.365 --> 00:46:33.646]  Right now, that Operation Northwoods is an official U.S.
[00:46:33.686 --> 00:46:35.566]  government plan to do just what I just said.
[00:46:35.886 --> 00:46:36.726]  And you're going to lose $100,000.
[00:46:38.347 --> 00:46:38.907]  But you know what?
[00:46:39.127 --> 00:46:40.387]  Go ahead, make the bet, buddy.
[00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:43.008]  Go ahead, come down here and let's... In fact, let's do it next week.
[00:46:43.348 --> 00:46:45.328]  You show up at the studio... No, shut up!
[00:46:45.388 --> 00:46:45.688]  Shut up!
[00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:46.488]  Put him on hold!
[00:46:46.648 --> 00:46:47.229]  Put him on hold!
[00:46:47.269 --> 00:46:47.869]  Put him on hold!
[00:46:48.789 --> 00:46:50.789]  We'll have a notary here and we'll sign it.
[00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:53.670]  You're saying Operation Northwoods doesn't exist.
[00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.370]  Put him back on.
[00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:55.770]  Put the idiot back on.
[00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:56.731]  Go ahead.
[00:46:57.011 --> 00:46:58.211]  Now, sir, I'm going to let you finish up.
[00:46:58.231 --> 00:46:58.791]  You go ahead and talk.
[00:47:00.204 --> 00:47:04.441]  Alex, the reason that Air America went bankrupt is because...
[00:47:04.864 --> 00:47:14.409]  Because you guys have absolutely no concept of... Sir, I'm not a liberal, and Air America has... Yes, you are a liberal.
[00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:20.993]  So Bush is good though with an amnesty plan, and the North American Union, and tripling, it was double, now tripling the size of the BATF.
[00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:23.734]  I bet he didn't do that either!
[00:47:23.794 --> 00:47:26.736]  I bet he didn't do that!
[00:47:26.856 --> 00:47:30.398]  And spending more money than presidents, all presidents before him combined.
[00:47:30.905 --> 00:47:31.305]  Go ahead.
[00:47:31.605 --> 00:47:33.866]  I want my family protected, that's all I can tell you.
[00:47:33.986 --> 00:47:38.228]  Oh yeah, and they're going to protect you by leaving the border open, but taking your habeas corpus away.
[00:47:38.248 --> 00:47:39.889]  Do you even know what habeas corpus is?
[00:47:40.209 --> 00:47:40.809]  Yeah, I do, buddy.
[00:47:40.909 --> 00:47:41.449]  Oh, what is it?
[00:47:41.469 --> 00:47:41.749]  Tell me.
[00:47:41.789 --> 00:47:42.470]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:43.390]  No, shut up!
[00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:45.591]  You tell me what it is, okay?
[00:47:45.631 --> 00:47:46.291]  Don't just shift it.
[00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:48.632]  Habeas micorpus, produce micorpus.
[00:47:48.872 --> 00:47:50.253]  No, that's the Latin for it.
[00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:51.273]  What does it mean in law?
[00:47:51.946 --> 00:48:04.289]  You have to produce written evidence, and you have to produce... And it means that you get to go challenge your accusers, and it means you get to have a day in court, publicly, not having a... Not having a bag... That's right.
[00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:07.070]  And your president lied and said it wasn't for U.S.
[00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:07.410]  citizens.
[00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.331]  I'm going to ask you right now, and I'm surprised he even knows what Habeas Corpus is.
[00:48:10.351 --> 00:48:11.051]  He didn't know what it was.
[00:48:11.511 --> 00:48:12.691]  I'm going to ask you something right now.
[00:48:12.931 --> 00:48:13.592]  Do U.S.
[00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:16.832]  citizens deserve... But I bet you said it's a lie.
[00:48:16.892 --> 00:48:18.093]  I'm lying because I'm a liberal.
[00:48:19.273 --> 00:48:23.197]  When Bill Clinton was in, I was known as the evil, most evil right-wing person on earth.
[00:48:23.597 --> 00:48:24.378]  I haven't changed.
[00:48:24.558 --> 00:48:25.619]  You've changed, twit!
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.360]  Go ahead.
[00:48:27.801 --> 00:48:28.502]  Alex, you still there?
[00:48:28.522 --> 00:48:29.163]  Yeah, I'm here.
[00:48:29.743 --> 00:48:35.508]  Listen, tell you what, would you go have lunch with a guy named Jose Padilla, who's an enemy who's a U.S.
[00:48:35.529 --> 00:48:35.949]  citizen,
[00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:48.461]  There's an enemy combatant who was talking about making a dirty bomb to blow up and detonate... Jose Padilla, as usual as a patsy, was registered as mentally retarded with an ADIQ, mildly retarded, out of prison.
[00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:56.790]  He was just some idiot, I'll put him on hold again, some idiot who shot his mouth off, and later in the next hour I'm going to show you how they have patsies and then how the rest are U.S.
[00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:57.450]  government agents.
[00:48:57.771 --> 00:48:58.071]  Go ahead.
[00:48:59.164 --> 00:49:01.387]  You see, you know, go ahead and cut me off, but you can't.
[00:49:01.607 --> 00:49:05.072]  Jose Padilla trained... No, you talked over me, so I'll put you on hold.
[00:49:05.432 --> 00:49:10.159]  ...trained in Pakistan, came back to do a dirty bomb, and you cannot deny that.
[00:49:10.539 --> 00:49:13.904]  Actually, it's been proven that he had no materials, no control, no connection.
[00:49:14.244 --> 00:49:27.871]  It was all just some ex-con, mentally retarded person as usual, just like the people in Miami, the black kids, the black Christians, giving 50 and then another 10 grand to stand up and pledge allegiance to non-existent Al Qaeda.
[00:49:28.071 --> 00:49:30.152]  The founder of the group was an FBI agent.
[00:49:30.312 --> 00:49:33.353]  They go out and find mental patients to do this, sir.
[00:49:33.953 --> 00:49:42.818]  What about, was it a mental patient crossing the Canadian border in Niagara Falls with explosives to plant in the needle?
[00:49:43.956 --> 00:49:44.317]  Pardon me?
[00:49:44.517 --> 00:49:44.917]  The needle.
[00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:46.299]  Whatever.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.303]  I mean... Sir, sir, sir.
[00:49:49.784 --> 00:49:50.885]  That was staged as well.
[00:49:51.106 --> 00:49:52.027]  Let me just ask you a question.
[00:49:52.267 --> 00:49:59.477]  You actually believe Operation Northwoods doesn't exist, and you believe that this bill, 6616, doesn't say U.S.
[00:49:59.497 --> 00:49:59.917]  citizens?
[00:50:01.039 --> 00:50:01.660]  I don't believe that.
[00:50:02.478 --> 00:50:06.002]  Okay, you... I'll tell you what I'll do, Alex.
[00:50:06.202 --> 00:50:09.606]  When I get home tonight, I'll pull that up and I'll Google it on my computer.
[00:50:09.646 --> 00:50:12.088]  If I'm wrong, I'll be back in touch with you next weekend.
[00:50:12.228 --> 00:50:13.570]  Okay, but I'm asking you a question, sir.
[00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:16.993]  Do you think Operation Northwood... Do you think I would just get up here and lie?
[00:50:17.854 --> 00:50:19.516]  Well, but you're lying about other things.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:20.560]  Oh, really?
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.141]  What is that?
[00:50:21.641 --> 00:50:29.906]  Well, you know, when you talk about Jose Padilla being mentally retarded, when you talk, I mean, you totally ignore the fact we just passed a bill to build 700 miles of fence on the border.
[00:50:30.267 --> 00:50:31.227]  I live in Texas.
[00:50:31.307 --> 00:50:32.368]  I travel to Mexico.
[00:50:33.038 --> 00:50:33.258]  Sure.
[00:50:34.019 --> 00:50:36.622]  Sir, I've talked to the former head of the Border Patrol Union.
[00:50:36.943 --> 00:50:38.985]  I've interviewed the men and women on the ground there.
[00:50:39.226 --> 00:50:43.271]  We have 2,000 less Border Patrol on the southern border than we had before 9-11.
[00:50:43.311 --> 00:50:46.174]  That 7,000 mile fence is a piecemeal joke.
[00:50:46.214 --> 00:50:49.338]  The 6,000 troops Bush claimed he would put down there, he only put 1,000.
[00:50:49.378 --> 00:50:51.421]  We're not even allowed to have weapons.
[00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:52.462]  Most of them are in support.
[00:50:52.762 --> 00:50:56.003]  It's really only 200 at any one time down there on the border.
[00:50:56.283 --> 00:51:00.384]  He is going to legalize all the illegal aliens so that won't even be needed down there.
[00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:06.786]  It's all a North American Union agreement and unfortunately I've got to let you go because we've got a break here in just a minute or so.
[00:51:07.366 --> 00:51:09.526]  I apologize to the callers because I want to get to all of you.
[00:51:09.546 --> 00:51:15.388]  When we come back we'll go right back to your calls and get Angel and Steppenwolf and Jay and Nick and everybody on.
[00:51:16.148 --> 00:51:19.750]  You know, this caller believes Bush's plan is a real border plan.
[00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:21.871]  You have been totally smoke and mirrored.
[00:51:22.211 --> 00:51:22.651]  Scam.
[00:51:22.831 --> 00:51:25.793]  Go talk to all the border activist groups, people that really know.
[00:51:26.653 --> 00:51:29.214]  Numbers USA, American Border Patrol, the Minutemen.
[00:51:29.574 --> 00:51:30.475]  I've been down to the borders.
[00:51:30.555 --> 00:51:31.695]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:51:31.715 --> 00:51:33.436]  I mean, come on!
[00:51:33.796 --> 00:51:35.757]  You're trying to say Bush is doing something on the border?
[00:51:35.937 --> 00:51:37.538]  He wants a blanket amnesty plan!
[00:51:38.259 --> 00:51:39.379]  He's getting rid of the border!
[00:51:40.099 --> 00:51:43.281]  We'll be right back, my friends, on the other side of news and information.
[00:51:44.116 --> 00:51:45.961]  And there's so many other issues.
[00:51:46.061 --> 00:51:47.485]  Jesse Ventura interview is coming up.
[00:51:47.505 --> 00:51:49.028]  That's right, former governor will be on air.
[00:51:49.858 --> 00:51:50.558]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:21.779 --> 00:52:24.261]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.742 --> 00:52:26.643]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.364 --> 00:52:30.546]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.187 --> 00:52:37.652]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:52:38.432 --> 00:52:40.634]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:52:41.014 --> 00:52:41.254]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:41.274 --> 00:52:41.735]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:59.564]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:52:59.725 --> 00:53:01.565]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:53:02.326 --> 00:53:03.947]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.207 --> 00:53:05.367]  Defending our borders.
[00:53:05.407 --> 00:53:07.428]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:08.869]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:11.471]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.551 --> 00:53:13.612]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:53:13.792 --> 00:53:13.972]  This
[00:53:14.452 --> 00:53:19.113]  This is the Alex Jones Show on News Radio 590 KLVJ.
[00:53:19.573 --> 00:53:29.436]  Call Alex now at 836-0590, pound 590 for those on a wireless, and call free at 1-877-590-KLVJ.
[00:53:30.156 --> 00:53:33.277]  Now, Alex Jones.
[00:53:33.997 --> 00:53:35.377]  Man, I love that intro.
[00:53:35.417 --> 00:53:38.858]  That is blood-pumping nuclear-powered brain damage, baby.
[00:53:40.499 --> 00:53:41.839]  You know, I get fired up about freedom.
[00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:46.504]  I get upset, I get angry about the loss of our liberties, and for good reason.
[00:53:46.705 --> 00:53:56.358]  Look, I don't dislike sports or getting all, you know, excited about whatever your hobby is, but don't get mad at me that I get excited about our country and our freedoms.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:07.463]  And we had a caller at the end of the last hour, many of you probably heard him, for those that didn't, who just was saying I was a liar, Operation Northwoods didn't exist, and the stuff I claimed that was in this bill doesn't exist.
[00:54:07.543 --> 00:54:12.625]  It's in the New York Times, LA Times, Associated Press, Reuters, all reporting that it affects U.S.
[00:54:12.685 --> 00:54:16.026]  citizens, no more habeas corpus, no more Bill of Rights, okay?
[00:54:16.446 --> 00:54:18.186]  What is it you can't get through your head?
[00:54:18.206 --> 00:54:20.107]  And then you denied Bush was
[00:54:20.647 --> 00:54:22.108]  Anything but a conservative?
[00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:24.570]  Listen, buddy, I'm a conservative, okay?
[00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.752]  I'm somebody who didn't go back on my values.
[00:54:26.992 --> 00:54:28.533]  I'm somebody who isn't brainwashed.
[00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:31.235]  So don't you ever call me a liberal!
[00:54:32.716 --> 00:54:33.497]  Make me sick!
[00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:37.240]  And don't even call me one of these modern conservatives.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.160]  I don't want to be known as that.
[00:54:38.421 --> 00:54:39.441]  I'm a freedom lover.
[00:54:39.662 --> 00:54:40.922]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:54:41.223 --> 00:54:42.384]  Now, we've got loaded phone lines here.
[00:54:42.404 --> 00:54:48.088]  We've got calls from Brooklyn, Hawaii, Utah, Miami, Chicago, and local calls as well.
[00:54:49.455 --> 00:54:53.836]  And I just want to go to each caller, give you about a minute or so because I want to be fair to the next person.
[00:54:53.876 --> 00:54:55.577]  Then I'm going to get into the sex scandal.
[00:54:55.597 --> 00:54:58.838]  And I said there's a Republican homosexual cult running this country.
[00:54:59.698 --> 00:55:02.259]  I say that because they use it as compromise.
[00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:03.439]  Okay?
[00:55:03.879 --> 00:55:07.580]  You don't get into high levels unless they've got dirt on you and the dirt of choice.
[00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:12.002]  It's just like a gang where they say, you've got to go out and knock over an old lady.
[00:55:12.282 --> 00:55:14.322]  Then you're a made member of the Eastside Vatos.
[00:55:14.422 --> 00:55:14.723]  Okay?
[00:55:15.003 --> 00:55:16.163]  This is criminology.
[00:55:16.835 --> 00:55:20.576]  And so a lot of them who aren't even into this do this, because this is how you become a made man.
[00:55:20.596 --> 00:55:25.718]  This is how you become a super high-level Republican most of the time.
[00:55:27.518 --> 00:55:29.519]  Folks, it's the truth, and I'm going to get into it.
[00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:31.060]  So just get ready, okay?
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:31.800]  I'm going to get into it.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:32.920]  And I've got the proof.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.921]  Let's go ahead and talk to Antoine in Brooklyn, New York.
[00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:41.063]  You're nationwide from the studios of NewsRadio 590KLBJ.
[00:55:41.143 --> 00:55:41.483]  Go ahead.
[00:55:42.223 --> 00:55:44.284]  Hi, my name is Antoine from Brooklyn.
[00:55:45.956 --> 00:55:49.157]  I'm a big fan of yours, a long-time listener.
[00:55:49.177 --> 00:55:49.917]  Good to have you on board.
[00:55:49.937 --> 00:55:50.457]  What's on your mind?
[00:55:52.858 --> 00:55:56.118]  As you say, there's been a lot of changes that have taken place in the past week.
[00:55:57.159 --> 00:55:57.999]  I'm confused.
[00:55:58.019 --> 00:55:59.659]  There's been so many rapid changes.
[00:55:59.739 --> 00:56:06.581]  Can you just quickly go through, since last Sunday, what has gone on this week for your listeners?
[00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:11.742]  Also, you just touched on it, the blackmailing of congressional leaders.
[00:56:12.613 --> 00:56:21.868]  Um, with the homosexual sex, the pedophilia ring, how that may have influenced the voting record for these new legislative...
[00:56:22.998 --> 00:56:34.545]  Well, that's what the Mafia and the CIA always did, but in the past it was they'd get you in a room with three hookers and, you know, have you dressed up in a pig outfit or something and take photos of that, but that isn't a big enough scandal today.
[00:56:34.905 --> 00:56:40.449]  So it's, they pick people and they're state reps because they already know what they're doing at the state capitol.
[00:56:40.749 --> 00:56:48.754]  And then you just move up and whether it was the Democratic governor of New Jersey or, you know, the mayors of major cities.
[00:56:48.794 --> 00:56:50.455]  Folks, I have hundreds of articles.
[00:56:50.515 --> 00:56:51.996]  I have the Washington Times.
[00:56:52.337 --> 00:56:52.799]  With a 1989 headline,
[00:56:57.466 --> 00:56:59.006]  You know, a callboy scandal.
[00:56:59.066 --> 00:57:02.928]  Underage, 14-year-old callboys by the dozens brought into the White House.
[00:57:03.388 --> 00:57:11.490]  Jeff Gannon, the male madam and porn star, bringing in all these other men during the current Bush administration White House late at night.
[00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:16.631]  Bush doing weird things in public where he rubs Gannon's head and kisses him on the cheek.
[00:57:16.872 --> 00:57:17.892]  I mean, I have those photos.
[00:57:18.092 --> 00:57:20.352]  It's from video stills at press conferences.
[00:57:20.412 --> 00:57:22.033]  And I mean, I'm not saying Bush is doing anything.
[00:57:22.433 --> 00:57:26.115]  I'm just saying he likes to put his cheek up against Gannon and give him a little kiss.
[00:57:26.415 --> 00:57:28.516]  And then we're all supposed to just ignore this?
[00:57:29.276 --> 00:57:34.618]  My questions are regarding the timing of the release of this information with the legislation that's being passed.
[00:57:34.938 --> 00:57:36.159]  Do you see any connection there?
[00:57:36.939 --> 00:57:46.323]  You know, they don't need to intimidate people like this individual, Representative Mark Foley, okay?
[00:57:46.823 --> 00:57:50.044]  They don't need to release something on him.
[00:57:50.204 --> 00:57:51.805]  But it may scare everybody else!
[00:57:52.378 --> 00:57:57.683]  In the final vote Friday, when it came out of both the House and Senate conferences, they got the bill all meshed together and unified.
[00:58:09.798 --> 00:58:11.860]  Because it has to be 100% identical on both sides.
[00:58:13.281 --> 00:58:16.003]  They could be burning Foley as a way to get everybody in line.
[00:58:16.203 --> 00:58:18.705]  Now it's coming out that Hastert knew and they covered up.
[00:58:18.925 --> 00:58:29.113]  It turned out, this is all over the news, this is ABC News reporting as well as the Associated Press, that a year ago everybody said, don't be his page, don't work for him, he'll come after you.
[00:58:30.368 --> 00:58:31.249]  He's doing all of this.
[00:58:31.289 --> 00:58:35.312]  It turns out the government, the FBI, had these emails for months and did nothing.
[00:58:35.932 --> 00:58:37.673]  I don't know why this is just now coming out.
[00:58:37.733 --> 00:58:38.594]  I heard the news earlier.
[00:58:38.614 --> 00:58:41.696]  They were saying, ask Alberto Gonzalez to investigate.
[00:58:41.716 --> 00:58:44.558]  I mean, that's like asking the fox to guard the hen house.
[00:58:44.578 --> 00:58:45.919]  It is such a joke.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.522]  Let's go ahead and talk to Angel in Hawaii.
[00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:51.023]  You're on KLBJ.
[00:58:51.043 --> 00:58:51.684]  What's on your mind?
[00:58:52.524 --> 00:58:56.387]  Hey Alex, I was trying to email you an audio clip.
[00:58:57.708 --> 00:58:59.890]  But the email kept bouncing back.
[00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:02.771]  Yeah, we've changed some of our email systems.
[00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:03.592]  We're having some problems.
[00:59:03.612 --> 00:59:04.712]  We're going to try to work it out.
[00:59:04.732 --> 00:59:06.353]  We're getting these reports of stuff bouncing.
[00:59:06.634 --> 00:59:11.496]  Try to go to InfoWars.com and there's a web form right there where you can send us stuff, but go ahead.
[00:59:12.317 --> 00:59:16.879]  Okay, this is a little shocking to me, but... Go ahead and tell us.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.981]  It was from a Democracy Now!
[00:59:19.141 --> 00:59:21.262]  with Amy Goodman podcast.
[00:59:21.382 --> 00:59:26.325]  It was from Friday, and she was interviewing Senator Leahy from Vermont.
[00:59:27.325 --> 00:59:30.126]  Uh, about that new bill that you've been talking about today.
[00:59:30.907 --> 00:59:37.450]  And, um, about 18 minutes into it, she asks, you know, what would be different if the Democrats would be in power?
[00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:43.332]  And he starts talking about how the Republicans are blocking various investigations.
[00:59:44.193 --> 00:59:45.613]  And this is a quote.
[00:59:45.713 --> 00:59:46.654]  This is something he says.
[00:59:46.774 --> 00:59:56.438]  He says, quote, you know, one thing they're blocking, quote, why did 9-11 happen on George Bush's watch when he had clear warnings it was going to happen?
[00:59:57.245 --> 00:59:59.187]  Why did they allow it to happen?
[01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:03.591]  Well listen, do me a favor.
[01:00:03.712 --> 01:00:08.977]  You can email me, try to email me at Kevin at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:09.077 --> 01:00:11.199]  I know that's one of the accounts they haven't shut down.
[01:00:11.259 --> 01:00:13.261]  Try Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:13.301 --> 01:00:14.142]  I appreciate your call.
[01:00:14.482 --> 01:00:16.865]  Let's jam one more caller in here.
[01:00:17.545 --> 01:00:18.647]  Let's talk to
[01:00:19.986 --> 01:00:20.886]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:00:20.946 --> 01:00:23.507]  Steppenwolf in Utah.
[01:00:23.667 --> 01:00:28.369]  Steppenwolf, you're blasting out nationwide from the studios of NewsRadio 590K LBJ.
[01:00:29.189 --> 01:00:30.210]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.570]  Good, sir.
[01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:32.870]  It's Steppenwolf from MySpace.
[01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:36.932]  Hey, I just wanted to commiserate with you, man.
[01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:44.314]  I feel like shedding tears with you, and I feel like running out in the street and yelling at the top of my lungs that freedom is dead.
[01:00:44.615 --> 01:00:48.696]  Yeah, I had dinner with my parents last night, my family and my grandmother, my children's great-grandmother,
[01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.511]  We were all totally freaked out.
[01:00:50.551 --> 01:00:54.895]  My dad read the bill, and we were literally grieving for the country.
[01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.997]  This is allowed to go.
[01:00:57.017 --> 01:00:58.798]  This is the end of America, folks.
[01:00:58.838 --> 01:01:02.361]  We're not just using that as a turn of phrase.
[01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:03.122]  We're serious.
[01:01:03.922 --> 01:01:04.102]  Yep.
[01:01:04.883 --> 01:01:05.243]  Amen.
[01:01:06.404 --> 01:01:12.249]  You know, I've only been listening to you for a couple months, but everything you say is checked out.
[01:01:12.269 --> 01:01:18.094]  And I'm not an easily trusting person, and I'm not a man that easily sheds tears either.
[01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:27.177]  But what's going on right now, I mean, you know, being a Christian-oriented, Bible-oriented person, I knew that this was going to happen eventually.
[01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:31.619]  Well, it is starting to happen, but according to an earlier caller, you're a liberal.
[01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:32.859]  What's that?
[01:01:33.239 --> 01:01:35.721]  According to that earlier caller, we're all liberals.
[01:01:36.241 --> 01:01:36.461]  Right.
[01:01:37.509 --> 01:01:54.121]  Yeah, well, I think I said on Paul Joseph Watson's blog the other day that they even consider you to be a liberal, and sure enough, here this guy calls up... And, you know, according to his real yardstick of liberals for big government, gun control, open borders, he supports a president who's a liberal!
[01:01:54.421 --> 01:01:55.202]  You're the liberal!
[01:01:55.362 --> 01:01:56.543]  You're the liberal, you fool!
[01:01:57.123 --> 01:01:58.384]  Right, they're the neolibs.
[01:01:58.684 --> 01:02:00.125]  That's it, they're the neolib, neocon.
[01:02:02.765 --> 01:02:05.446]  They don't know, they just give them a label, you see, and they just believe it.
[01:02:05.747 --> 01:02:13.911]  It's like Michael Savage, big beatnik in the 60's, wrote books, I won't even quote here on air, just look into it folks, wrote stuff you can't even believe.
[01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:18.553]  If conservatives knew what this guy... But see, that's how they operate, they're scum!
[01:02:18.953 --> 01:02:20.374]  They're not real conservatives!
[01:02:20.894 --> 01:02:22.835]  Wasn't David Horowitz like that too?
[01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:23.996]  Oh, they're all of them.
[01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:26.237]  He used to be a communist or something.
[01:02:26.697 --> 01:02:28.018]  Listen, they were Trotskyites!
[01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.219]  Who do you think the neocons are?
[01:02:30.239 --> 01:02:31.620]  Alright, we're out of time.
[01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:33.205]  We're going to go to break.
[01:02:33.225 --> 01:02:34.206]  We're going to come back.
[01:02:34.666 --> 01:02:36.268]  Take a few more calls, then I'm going to go into news.
[01:02:36.308 --> 01:02:39.830]  But Nick in Chicago, Jay in Miami Beach, and others, you stay with us.
[01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:44.233]  When we get back, though, we're going to continue with the calls, and I'm going to get into this pervert.
[01:02:44.273 --> 01:02:44.954]  He is a pervert.
[01:02:44.974 --> 01:02:47.435]  He's admitted to soliciting a 16-year-old.
[01:02:47.776 --> 01:02:48.496]  He's a pervert!
[01:02:48.776 --> 01:02:49.457]  He's a pervert!
[01:02:49.857 --> 01:02:50.438]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:50.478 --> 01:02:50.858]  Stay with us.
[01:02:55.018 --> 01:02:58.220]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.502]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:03:00.862 --> 01:03:08.528]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:16.253]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:16.653 --> 01:03:23.558]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:03:24.013 --> 01:03:28.094]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.354 --> 01:03:31.855]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.335 --> 01:03:34.256]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:38.497]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:51.920]  Gold.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.541]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:03:53.801 --> 01:03:59.882]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:04:00.062 --> 01:04:03.883]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:04:04.243 --> 01:04:06.124]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:04:06.184 --> 01:04:08.465]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:04:08.605 --> 01:04:13.586]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat currency.
[01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:14.207]  We're good to go.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:29.100]  I think so.
[01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:55.804]  Power-hungry secret societies seek to control history, even religion.
[01:04:56.065 --> 01:04:58.508]  Remember the uproar caused by the movie The Da Vinci Code?
[01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:06.340]  The majority of scholars admit that these same Gnostics hijacked the Apostles' writings and forged something far worse, the abomination of religious cannibalism.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.543]  Two Witnesses Ministries has compiled the facts.
[01:05:08.663 --> 01:05:09.163]  We're good to go.
[01:05:24.017 --> 01:05:25.738]  Request yours at P.O.
[01:05:26.198 --> 01:05:33.760]  Box 2453, Abilene, TX 79604 or call 325-572-3913.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.981]  How could the Hebrew Messiah institute an abomination of sacred blood drinking?
[01:05:39.361 --> 01:05:39.742]  He didn't.
[01:05:40.042 --> 01:05:40.882]  He taught the Torah.
[01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:45.143]  Do It Mrs. Ministries has cracked the bloodiest mystery of all time, the communion code.
[01:05:45.603 --> 01:05:45.803]  Call 325-572-3913.
[01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:48.384]  Don't let the secret societies take your crown.
[01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:56.192]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:58.514]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:58.774 --> 01:06:08.882]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:09.203 --> 01:06:11.565]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:06:43.053 --> 01:06:45.775]  Thank you for listening to GTN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:09.592]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on News Radio 590 KLPJ.
[01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:22.117]  Give Alex a piece of your mind at 836-0590-590 for those on a wireless and toll free at 1-877-590-KLPJ.
[01:07:22.597 --> 01:07:24.338]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:25.118 --> 01:07:28.099]  Oh yeah, I love standing up to liberals in denial.
[01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:30.696]  You're the most dangerous liberals, though.
[01:07:30.976 --> 01:07:32.576]  You're like sleeper agents.
[01:07:32.596 --> 01:07:33.476]  You don't even know it.
[01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:38.077]  You get like your little activations from your fake conservative commanders.
[01:07:38.177 --> 01:07:39.198]  You're just like zombies.
[01:07:39.658 --> 01:07:40.598]  I will turn in guns.
[01:07:40.758 --> 01:07:41.918]  I am for open border.
[01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:44.679]  Oh, I believe delusional stories about terror.
[01:07:44.999 --> 01:07:47.140]  Democrats will get me if I don't do it.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:55.162]  The Democrats voted 100% in the final conference vote for this bill and the other bill getting rid of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:07:55.791 --> 01:08:05.137]  You just call in and go, you're a liberal, it don't affect American citizens, and it don't have nothing to do, and there's no Northwoods.
[01:08:05.617 --> 01:08:07.038]  Well, yes, there is.
[01:08:07.078 --> 01:08:08.579]  You may believe in the Tooth Fairy, I don't.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:15.764]  My friends, I believe in real information, real issues, and that's what we're covering here every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:15.824 --> 01:08:17.225]  on News Radio 590-KLBJ.
[01:08:17.245 --> 01:08:23.329]  Now being syndicated, so I have to get out of the habit of saying News Radio 590-KLBJ and saying blasting out from Central Texas from the studios.
[01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:31.392]  We've got calls here from Miami Beach, Chicago, here locally, you name it.
[01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:33.092]  And I'd like to get some local calls.
[01:08:33.132 --> 01:08:41.355]  It's always nice to have the calls from out of Central Texas, but it's always nice to have the locals, whose conditioning we're breaking right now, we're deprogramming.
[01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:43.776]  836-0590, pound 590.
[01:08:43.936 --> 01:08:48.418]  Alright, let me get really serious here for a moment, then we'll start going back to your calls.
[01:08:50.094 --> 01:08:53.677]  I've covered the fact that they butchered the entire Bill of Rights, and that's what they did.
[01:08:53.697 --> 01:09:02.325]  When you get rid of habeas corpus, and due process, and secret arrest, and secret execution, and double jeopardy, and kangaroo courts, it's the end of the country.
[01:09:03.486 --> 01:09:08.671]  In fact, a warrantless searching bill is just icing on the cake, or maybe a cherry on top.
[01:09:09.517 --> 01:09:16.842]  But when I say that many of the Republicans at the Congressional level are part of a homosexual cult, that's improper.
[01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:17.242]  I'm wrong.
[01:09:17.663 --> 01:09:19.044]  A homosexual gang.
[01:09:19.104 --> 01:09:20.204]  Here, how does that sound?
[01:09:20.264 --> 01:09:23.166]  And I'm not here bashing homosexuals.
[01:09:23.567 --> 01:09:36.636]  What I'm saying is that I remember when I first got involved in fighting the New World Order, 14 years ago, got on air, TV almost 13, radio 11, 12 years ago, this kept coming up.
[01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.557]  Hey, do you know about the pedophile ring?
[01:09:39.099 --> 01:09:41.040]  Hey, have you seen this news article?
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:41.740]  People mail me.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:54.105]  Washington Post, and People Magazine, and Washington Times, and they'd have the credit card receipts from the White House in 1989 with the headline, Underage Callboys in White House.
[01:09:54.185 --> 01:09:56.085]  And I'm not going to talk about that.
[01:09:56.306 --> 01:09:56.766]  Oh, no.
[01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:58.827]  I mean, I was Mr. Republican back then.
[01:09:59.147 --> 01:10:01.207]  I worked for Pat Buchanan's campaign twice.
[01:10:01.227 --> 01:10:04.069]  You know, I'm out there, and I still like Pat, by the way.
[01:10:04.089 --> 01:10:04.689]  He's a great guy.
[01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:05.989]  I had him on the show a few weeks ago.
[01:10:06.009 --> 01:10:07.830]  But the point is, I was a hardcore Republican.
[01:10:08.356 --> 01:10:10.077]  Until I was inside of it and saw it.
[01:10:10.757 --> 01:10:17.762]  And then there were all these scandals with governors and state reps and it just kept happening and it was almost always Republicans.
[01:10:17.802 --> 01:10:34.132]  I mean, you get a case with like the New Jersey governor last year, who's a Democrat, some of the time, but Republican pollsters, Republican strategists, Republican constantly caught either doing pervert stuff, which is their business, it's still weird though, they're a bunch of hypocrites, or illegal stuff.
[01:10:35.473 --> 01:10:37.434]  And how many shows have I told you?
[01:10:37.715 --> 01:10:41.657]  The heads of these organizations, the heads of the groups that supposedly protect children.
[01:10:42.898 --> 01:10:43.939]  Go read criminology.
[01:10:43.979 --> 01:10:45.660]  Go take a criminology course at UT.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.742]  If you've already graduated, you can go back as a graduate student.
[01:10:48.782 --> 01:10:50.023]  Go research this.
[01:10:50.303 --> 01:10:59.790]  You'll find out that you're five times more likely in truancy officers, in police officers, in school teachers, in school principals.
[01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:02.912]  That's why when you hear it in the news, it's always a school principal or it's always a truancy officer.
[01:11:03.984 --> 01:11:05.766]  To be involved in pedophilia.
[01:11:05.966 --> 01:11:09.709]  Because smart pedophiles, folks, don't run around trying to snatch kids off the streets.
[01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:12.210]  Smart pedophiles go get a uniform.
[01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:12.971]  Do you understand that?
[01:11:13.511 --> 01:11:24.479]  Well, here it is again, that Foley, this congressman, had co-chaired the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and had sponsored numerous bills aimed at protecting children from predators.
[01:11:24.499 --> 01:11:30.804]  And I remember seeing this guy on national TV like a year ago, and I was at a meeting, and we had it on at the office, and I was saying,
[01:11:32.182 --> 01:11:34.904]  My crew to start taping some of the stuff off the news.
[01:11:34.944 --> 01:11:38.667]  I turn the TV on and there's Foley and I said, boy, that guy just looks like one of them.
[01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:40.789]  It's like Carr looks like one.
[01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:43.311]  Remember the guy who claimed he did that thing with JonBenet Ramsey?
[01:11:43.671 --> 01:11:46.353]  And of course he is a pervert, but it turns out he's just a nut.
[01:11:46.994 --> 01:11:48.355]  But still, you can just look at him.
[01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.276]  They just look like that.
[01:11:49.316 --> 01:11:54.400]  They got little bug eyes that like glisten and they shift around when they look and they're all effeminate.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.382]  Just, oh, I want to get my hands around their neck and just
[01:11:56.762 --> 01:11:57.522]  Excuse me.
[01:11:58.003 --> 01:11:58.623]  And hug them.
[01:11:58.663 --> 01:11:59.183]  Yeah, no, no.
[01:11:59.463 --> 01:12:01.604]  I can't say anything against them here on air.
[01:12:01.664 --> 01:12:03.265]  I don't want to hurt them.
[01:12:03.305 --> 01:12:04.885]  Well, I do want to throw up on them.
[01:12:05.065 --> 01:12:05.385]  It's true.
[01:12:05.425 --> 01:12:06.106]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:12:06.266 --> 01:12:07.726]  I do want to hurt them, but I'm not going to.
[01:12:08.286 --> 01:12:10.607]  So, that's the job of the police.
[01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:12.328]  But the problem is the police are full of them.
[01:12:12.508 --> 01:12:14.409]  And again, if you're getting mad at that, I'm sorry.
[01:12:14.489 --> 01:12:15.549]  That's just criminology.
[01:12:15.569 --> 01:12:17.570]  If you can't deal with it, that's your problem.
[01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:23.552]  This is a show about truth, ladies and gentlemen, and the point is that most police and most
[01:12:24.657 --> 01:12:30.501]  School teachers are good people, and they care about society, and they're there to help.
[01:12:30.882 --> 01:12:37.106]  But the statistics, the numbers, the criminology is five times more likely.
[01:12:38.007 --> 01:12:43.691]  In public service related to children, you are going to have five times the number of sickos.
[01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:45.432]  That is criminology!
[01:12:45.492 --> 01:12:46.333]  That is fact!
[01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:47.434]  That is history!
[01:12:48.405 --> 01:12:50.327]  And so why do we trust the government?
[01:12:50.687 --> 01:12:51.288]  You cannot.
[01:12:51.308 --> 01:12:52.649]  That's what the founding fathers said.
[01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:53.650]  Do not trust them.
[01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:54.491]  Keep it small.
[01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.193]  Don't let them have control over you.
[01:12:56.213 --> 01:12:58.095]  Because if you do, you're going to get abused.
[01:12:58.135 --> 01:13:02.739]  Because not just are there five times more criminals on average, it's not just the pedophiles.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.042]  That number just keeps coming up over and over again.
[01:13:05.062 --> 01:13:05.702]  Go look at the numbers.
[01:13:05.722 --> 01:13:06.183]  Go pull them up.
[01:13:07.612 --> 01:13:09.173]  See, now they can't get caught.
[01:13:09.253 --> 01:13:10.413]  Now they can't get in trouble.
[01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:12.133]  Now it's harder for them to get busted.
[01:13:12.194 --> 01:13:17.195]  Now they've got governmental power and governmental office shielding them.
[01:13:17.215 --> 01:13:20.036]  Do you see how sophisticated this has gotten?
[01:13:20.876 --> 01:13:21.916]  And I have all the articles here.
[01:13:22.196 --> 01:13:23.157]  This is AP today.
[01:13:23.497 --> 01:13:30.639]  GOP leaders knew of Foley emails in 2005, but Hasford lied to investigators, and Hasford lied to the Washington Post.
[01:13:30.899 --> 01:13:31.919]  Of course he lied!
[01:13:33.653 --> 01:13:39.375]  And now it's not just emails to one young man, one boy, it's to a bunch of boys.
[01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:56.122]  And the report is everybody knew about this for years and everybody said unless you want this, I mean imagine parents, you know the joke is, people that know about Capitol Hill is, you know, do not send your young men and women as pages to Capitol Hill unless you want them to go up the fast track of power or they'll end up getting power.
[01:13:56.502 --> 01:13:58.943]  They'll get some big high appointment or job twenty years later.
[01:13:58.963 --> 01:13:59.763]  That's how this works.
[01:13:59.983 --> 01:14:01.304]  This is how the
[01:14:02.216 --> 01:14:04.198]  Homosexual gang operates.
[01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.141]  And you're shooting right to the top.
[01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:07.943]  And they've also got camp follower women.
[01:14:08.423 --> 01:14:08.944]  Young women.
[01:14:09.504 --> 01:14:10.786]  Young girls, in many cases.
[01:14:11.587 --> 01:14:13.689]  But they're not as... Again, we've done a study of this.
[01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:16.612]  The young girls aren't really what they're into.
[01:14:18.018 --> 01:14:23.485]  That's kind of like when you go to a grocery store and they say, well, this milk is our best-selling brand.
[01:14:23.505 --> 01:14:24.666]  80% of them choose this type.
[01:14:24.846 --> 01:14:26.869]  We have this other milk over here, if that's what you like.
[01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:30.232]  So the point is, they are... I mean, this is sick!
[01:14:30.353 --> 01:14:31.294]  I know this is sick!
[01:14:31.574 --> 01:14:35.318]  But just type in Republican sex scandal and just get ready.
[01:14:35.459 --> 01:14:36.900]  And type Democratic sex scandal in.
[01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:38.242]  You won't find as much.
[01:14:39.495 --> 01:14:50.920]  Again, the people, it's basic psychology, the people posing as the good guys, the people posing as the people that want to take care of the children and are so conservative, they're a bunch of bug-eyed perverts!
[01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:57.323]  So, a bunch of them are part of a gay gang, and then the others are part of a pedophile ring, and they are despicable.
[01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:59.031]  And I have the proof.
[01:14:59.071 --> 01:14:59.831]  I have the documents.
[01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:01.192]  Again, I have mainstream headlines.
[01:15:01.672 --> 01:15:04.994]  Top gay porn stars servicing moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[01:15:05.415 --> 01:15:09.117]  Well, I don't need to read that in the New York Post about Republicans in this Republican paper.
[01:15:09.717 --> 01:15:10.398]  Rupert Murdoch.
[01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:12.079]  I don't have to read that there.
[01:15:12.199 --> 01:15:15.281]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove, folks, and I had old men approaching me.
[01:15:16.201 --> 01:15:16.581]  Okay?
[01:15:17.002 --> 01:15:20.184]  This is the creme de la creme of the conservative leadership.
[01:15:20.204 --> 01:15:22.365]  We're going to break when we get back.
[01:15:23.365 --> 01:15:28.987]  Well, here's that New York Post, Gay Porn Stars, Services, Bohemian Grove Members, New York Page Six, July 22nd, 2004.
[01:15:30.227 --> 01:15:30.807]  Here's another one.
[01:15:32.287 --> 01:15:37.589]  Yeah, we got Jesse Ventura coming up after we take some calls here in the next segment.
[01:15:37.989 --> 01:15:42.710]  And I've got news about the 9-1-1 bombers, the supposed bombers, this new fake tape.
[01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:46.351]  I've got Al Gore out shilling-lying about global warming, it's really a global tax.

[01:18:53.399 --> 01:18:57.520]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.520]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:06.062]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:19:06.362 --> 01:19:12.483]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:18.745]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions

[01:20:31.622 --> 01:20:36.046]  If you know history, if you've studied history, you know that Nero and Caligula during the
[01:20:36.641 --> 01:20:38.002]  Decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
[01:20:38.102 --> 01:20:39.943]  All of their emperors.
[01:20:40.123 --> 01:20:46.367]  They'd have public parties where they'd slit children's throats and they'd dress up like werewolves and then start devouring the children.
[01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:48.188]  This is mainstream Roman history.
[01:20:48.448 --> 01:20:56.473]  Caligula married his horse and then would read its droppings in the Senate to decide, like the tea leaves, on what he would do.
[01:20:56.533 --> 01:20:57.354]  Just scope to study.
[01:20:57.774 --> 01:20:59.535]  The Nazis were into sick things.
[01:21:00.095 --> 01:21:01.336]  I'm not going to get into on air.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.443]  The hierarchy of most elites throughout history, parasitic elites, dictators, are always into sick stuff, folks.
[01:21:08.723 --> 01:21:26.310]  And you've got a very corrupt... I mean, America's as decadent as it gets, and you've got a... They don't let you into high-level congressional committees or chairmanships, in most cases, unless you've been involved in arms smuggling, murder for hire, you're old CIA, they've got a bunch of dirt on you, or you're part of the good old boy
[01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:28.917]  Pervert Club, basically.
[01:21:28.957 --> 01:21:39.785]  And that's what we're talking about here today, is how they're using the Pervert Club, just like the British had the Hellfire Club, which is another pervert club, to show your compromise, so they can now trust you.
[01:21:40.065 --> 01:21:44.048]  And then they burn, occasionally, one of their people, just to get everybody else back in line.
[01:21:44.088 --> 01:21:45.849]  And, yeah, I think the caller has a point.
[01:21:45.989 --> 01:21:50.452]  To pass legislation bringing us into an official dictatorship.
[01:21:51.352 --> 01:21:56.757]  And we've got all the mainstream news articles posted up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if you want to go document all this.
[01:21:56.777 --> 01:22:04.963]  But look, Congressman Foley had co-chaired the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children and had sponsored numerous bills into protecting children and predators.
[01:22:05.184 --> 01:22:11.689]  Remember two years ago that big scandal, 3,000 plus children were missing in Florida that CPS, Child Protective Services had taken?
[01:22:12.547 --> 01:22:15.468]  And nobody knew where they'd gone, and most of them haven't been found today.
[01:22:15.508 --> 01:22:16.508]  A lot of them have been found dead.
[01:22:16.768 --> 01:22:21.570]  It turned out the top three people running CPS in Florida were convicted pedophiles.
[01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.071]  I mean, child rapists, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:27.732]  What better job for them but running the entire operation?
[01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.853]  And they were fired, but then nothing happened.
[01:22:29.893 --> 01:22:37.915]  You see, this is the type of horrors that grows under the umbrella of national security, or state secrets, or even county secrets.
[01:22:38.215 --> 01:22:40.516]  You want transparency in government, or criminals,
[01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.959]  Can, and will, and always have taken it over.
[01:22:45.221 --> 01:22:48.984]  Think of the most horrible thing you can think of, and if you've got a secret government, it's going on.
[01:22:50.086 --> 01:22:58.654]  Okay, I've got the Ventura interview, I've got the laughing 9-11 bombers, this new tape right on time of the election, a bunch of big developments there.
[01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:01.057]  I want to comment on what global warming is.
[01:23:01.906 --> 01:23:03.787]  Hey Alex, man, you're a true American and a great man.
[01:23:30.928 --> 01:23:36.513]  Uh, Thursday night I sat and watched my wife and I sat and watched the Senate pass the new legislation.
[01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:37.654]  Thursday night.
[01:23:37.734 --> 01:23:45.521]  Friday we get up, we listen to your broadcast on InfoWars and I went through the bill with you as you were doing it and I had the U.S.
[01:23:45.581 --> 01:23:47.422]  codebook out and I was horrified.
[01:23:47.983 --> 01:23:50.645]  Absolutely horrified at what's going on.
[01:23:50.665 --> 01:23:55.369]  Hey, you could do like a caller last hour just say it's a lie and we're lying and it doesn't exist and go back to sleep.
[01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:57.431]  I was actually getting heated listening to him.
[01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:58.747]  He's an idiot.
[01:23:58.787 --> 01:23:59.387]  You said it right.
[01:23:59.808 --> 01:24:00.948]  There's no other way to call it.
[01:24:01.508 --> 01:24:05.429]  Well, I mean, he didn't say, I think it can't be true, or you've got to be wrong.
[01:24:05.649 --> 01:24:07.150]  No, just, you're a liar, Alex.
[01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:07.870]  You're a liar.
[01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:09.450]  Where are the true Americans?
[01:24:09.530 --> 01:24:11.791]  They've been destroyed by design.
[01:24:11.851 --> 01:24:18.353]  Well, you know, when I was young in college, I didn't believe that the Nazis didn't know, or the Germans didn't know what the Nazis were doing.
[01:24:18.613 --> 01:24:20.293]  And now that I know history, I believe it.
[01:24:20.613 --> 01:24:23.634]  After the war, that's why they made them go look at the death camps of the dead people.
[01:24:23.914 --> 01:24:26.857]  And the horrors, because the Germans were going, we don't believe it still!
[01:24:27.117 --> 01:24:27.757]  We don't believe it!
[01:24:28.258 --> 01:24:30.540]  Because people cannot believe this stuff!
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.781]  It's too horrible!
[01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:32.221]  Fine!
[01:24:32.241 --> 01:24:33.322]  You're going to be slaves, folks!
[01:24:33.522 --> 01:24:38.527]  They want tyranny to take your pension funds, to take your bank accounts, to make your sons and daughters go fight in foreign wars.
[01:24:38.727 --> 01:24:39.948]  Tyranny ain't pretty, folks!
[01:24:40.128 --> 01:24:41.769]  Lickin' boots, being a slave isn't fun!
[01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:45.673]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Chicago.
[01:24:45.913 --> 01:24:46.914]  Go ahead, Nick, you're on air.
[01:24:47.474 --> 01:24:49.676]  Hey, Brother Jones, I've got some good news for you for once.
[01:24:50.057 --> 01:24:50.417]  Well, good.
[01:24:50.437 --> 01:24:50.817]  Let me hear it.
[01:24:52.256 --> 01:25:01.045]  LoneLantern.org received a care package from Mr. Avery, Rowe, and Bremer, consisting of 4,800 copies of their latest re-edit of Loose Change.
[01:25:01.065 --> 01:25:06.130]  Okay, for those that aren't on the inside of all this, you're calling like you called on Friday, which is great.
[01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.452]  You guys are going to, hold on, let me just stop.
[01:25:08.472 --> 01:25:12.877]  You guys are going to hand out tens of thousands, well they've already handed out tens of thousands, 4,000 more.
[01:25:14.738 --> 01:25:15.499]  I think that's great.
[01:25:15.559 --> 01:25:16.800]  I think that's awesome.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.822]  I wish I had the capital to give you guys 4,800 Terror Storms for free.
[01:25:38.113 --> 01:25:40.714]  We hand out your stuff as our own expenses.
[01:25:40.974 --> 01:25:41.314]  Okay?
[01:25:41.354 --> 01:25:42.435]  This was just a gift from them.
[01:25:42.475 --> 01:25:43.155]  No, they're awesome.
[01:25:43.355 --> 01:25:44.295]  In fact, I'm thinking about it.
[01:25:44.315 --> 01:25:49.097]  I should just... The country's so desperate now, I ought to spend all the money I got and print up a hundred thousand.
[01:25:49.117 --> 01:25:50.897]  Those things are not that much and just give them out.
[01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:52.018]  But, I don't know.
[01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:52.818]  It's cool.
[01:25:52.978 --> 01:25:55.679]  I just want to give all our brothers and sisters out there an important message.
[01:25:56.079 --> 01:25:59.500]  If you read the good book, you know how this war ends and we are the winners.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:00.141]  That's right.
[01:26:00.181 --> 01:26:00.681]  God bless you.
[01:26:00.701 --> 01:26:01.961]  I appreciate your call from Chicago.
[01:26:02.001 --> 01:26:03.062]  Thanks for holding to tell us that.
[01:26:03.822 --> 01:26:05.582]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lynn in North Austin.
[01:26:05.602 --> 01:26:06.603]  She's got questions about 9-11.
[01:26:07.751 --> 01:26:09.453]  And, Flight 93, welcome.
[01:26:10.153 --> 01:26:10.553]  Hello.
[01:26:10.734 --> 01:26:11.034]  Hi.
[01:26:11.054 --> 01:26:11.574]  Hi.
[01:26:11.594 --> 01:26:32.931]  Yeah, I've been watching you for a long time, and after 9-1-1, I sort of listened, but then I sort of got, I don't know, it was just hard for me to believe a lot of the things, like for instance, I've watched a lot more since then, because I have a... And it's hard to believe that there's a gay gang running the Republican Party, but it's all going to come out.
[01:26:32.951 --> 01:26:35.213]  Yeah, that is hard to believe, but you know, I mean,
[01:26:36.088 --> 01:26:36.428]  I don't know.
[01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:38.990]  We just watched that movie today, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:40.010]  It's powerful, isn't it?
[01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:41.031]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[01:26:41.491 --> 01:26:43.032]  And I had to email a few people about it.
[01:26:44.193 --> 01:26:46.034]  The thing is, I have a couple questions.
[01:26:46.934 --> 01:26:57.961]  One of them is, the 93 flight, is it true that that 93 flight, I know you're saying, and everyone's saying... Yeah, long before.
[01:26:58.901 --> 01:27:01.963]  That was over Shanksville, Pennsylvania, for those that don't know.
[01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:04.104]  It was an 8.5 mile debris field, an engine 8.5 miles away.
[01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:08.227]  The state police said they saw F-16s, saw explosions.
[01:27:08.987 --> 01:27:10.508]  The thing had an 8-plus mile debris fill.
[01:27:10.528 --> 01:27:11.509]  That means it was blown up.
[01:27:11.809 --> 01:27:13.450]  The whole let's roll thing was made up.
[01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:15.191]  We even know the name of the squadron.
[01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:16.652]  We even know the name of the officer.
[01:27:16.692 --> 01:27:19.874]  They put two AIM-9s or sidewinder missiles into it.
[01:27:20.194 --> 01:27:25.697]  And that was... The general in control disregarded orders to stand down and ordered that plane shot down.
[01:27:25.937 --> 01:27:28.418]  And if he wouldn't have ordered that, it was going to be flown into the Capitol.
[01:27:28.659 --> 01:27:30.680]  We would have had total decapitation of the government.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.301]  We would have had a dictatorship from them.
[01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:34.202]  Okay, so you're saying it was shot down.
[01:27:34.756 --> 01:27:36.778]  Yes, that's all the inside intel I've got.
[01:27:36.898 --> 01:27:44.043]  What about the thing about the fact that there was a plane that detoured to Ohio and the people got out there?
[01:27:44.063 --> 01:27:52.609]  Those are areas that I choose not to cover because there's areas of 9-11 that are foggy and the media likes to focus on those and claim that's our conspiracy theory.
[01:27:52.969 --> 01:27:54.330]  I focus on what we can prove.
[01:27:54.670 --> 01:28:03.497]  NORAD standing down, Bin Laden being known CIA, public officials warned not to fly, CIA insider trading at record levels against America and United in the four days,
[01:28:03.857 --> 01:28:04.317]  Before.
[01:28:04.618 --> 01:28:06.539]  Bombs clearly in the buildings, okay?
[01:28:06.999 --> 01:28:09.801]  Building 7 being a CIA... Let me just go through all the evidence.
[01:28:10.482 --> 01:28:10.822]  44,000 U.S.
[01:28:11.142 --> 01:28:15.685]  troops already massacred in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the two months before 9-11 to attack Afghanistan.
[01:28:15.926 --> 01:28:16.486]  Official U.S.
[01:28:16.506 --> 01:28:19.348]  government plans, like Operation Northwood, to launch 9-11 style attacks.
[01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.271]  Ok, what happened to the people that were on that plane?
[01:28:37.919 --> 01:28:45.541]  Again, you just brought up the point that the media, out of all the facts we've got, they always want to go into people's theories about did they land planes?
[01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:46.821]  Did they take off other planes?
[01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.721]  That's not the intel I have.
[01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:51.302]  I know that's in Northwoods, and I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[01:28:51.762 --> 01:28:52.802]  I know it's in Northwoods.
[01:28:52.822 --> 01:28:53.162]  The U.S.
[01:28:53.202 --> 01:29:00.943]  government says we'll have a plane take off and land and get the people off, then we'll fly another plane with the same tail numbers and crash it and blow it up and blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:29:01.363 --> 01:29:03.924]  I know in Northwoods the government says they do it that way.
[01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:07.025]  Okay, and so everybody focuses in on that particular U.S.
[01:29:07.065 --> 01:29:07.745]  government plan.
[01:29:08.225 --> 01:29:12.367]  I don't believe that's what the government criminal elements of it did on 9-11.
[01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:15.308]  Just like I said, you said, you know, what do you think about this?
[01:29:15.328 --> 01:29:19.409]  And I said, I don't think it's an important area to spend all our time looking at it because you can't prove it one way or the other.
[01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:20.409]  How about all this?
[01:29:20.429 --> 01:29:21.930]  And you say, well, I still want to talk about it.
[01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:26.091]  I understand, but there is other areas that need to be looked at.
[01:29:26.411 --> 01:29:26.791]  Okay?
[01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:28.412]  And people, for some reason, don't want to look at those.
[01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:30.915]  We're going to get a break, come back with a final segment.
[01:29:30.995 --> 01:29:32.638]  I've got to play this part of this Ventura interview.
[01:29:32.678 --> 01:29:33.921]  I've got to hit these other two news items.
[01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:38.770]  Then at the end, if I have time, I'll just come do radio graffiti and give you each a minute or so.
[01:29:39.131 --> 01:29:39.652]  Stay with us!
[01:29:51.826 --> 01:29:55.893]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:29:56.114 --> 01:29:59.500]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.146]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:30:03.419 --> 01:30:06.661]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:30:06.681 --> 01:30:12.164]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:30:12.184 --> 01:30:21.809]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.290]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:28.733]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:30:29.213 --> 01:30:33.656]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:30:33.676 --> 01:30:35.097]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:30:35.278 --> 01:30:39.140]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.021]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:30:53.965 --> 01:30:54.685]  Pinch me, Bill.
[01:30:54.965 --> 01:30:55.926]  I can't believe it.
[01:30:56.346 --> 01:30:59.147]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:30:59.527 --> 01:31:02.047]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[01:31:02.067 --> 01:31:04.228]  I know what you mean, John.
[01:31:04.248 --> 01:31:08.409]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:31:08.989 --> 01:31:12.790]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:14.451]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:19.793]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:31:20.093 --> 01:31:21.153]  And I owe it all to you.
[01:31:21.753 --> 01:31:25.055]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:25.135 --> 01:31:28.177]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.

[01:34:04.458 --> 01:34:08.183]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on News Radio 590 KLVJ.

[01:34:26.224 --> 01:34:26.925]  All right, my friends.
[01:34:27.025 --> 01:34:27.765]  Final segment.
[01:34:27.785 --> 01:34:30.087]  I'm going to air about five minutes of Jesse Ventura.
[01:34:30.107 --> 01:34:35.192]  I interviewed him for about 20 minutes of sit-down videotape interview earlier this week when he was here campaigning for Kinky Friedman.
[01:34:35.532 --> 01:34:40.817]  I knew he questioned the official 9-11 story, but he talked about Northwoods, he talked about Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:34:40.857 --> 01:34:44.060]  Our government staged that to get us into war, and he said it could certainly happen again.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.841]  We're going to play that section of the interview.
[01:34:46.262 --> 01:34:49.024]  But right now, let me get into the latest 9-11 news that's come out.
[01:34:50.846 --> 01:35:06.939]  Criminal elements of our government have been doling out lots of fake Al-Qaeda videotapes for years, and it comes out months later in each case that it was either old videotapes pre-9-11, re-edited by our government through their handlers, the people they handle at Al Jazeera, or it's fake videos, and that's been confirmed.
[01:35:06.959 --> 01:35:10.922]  You know, the fat bin Laden in the dark room, that's been voice-printed and face-scanned.
[01:35:10.962 --> 01:35:11.363]  It's fake.
[01:35:11.543 --> 01:35:15.546]  And that's come out in the press, but back of the paper, so the average American isn't aware of it.
[01:35:16.509 --> 01:35:28.585]  But now we have supposedly Mohammed Adam and one of his cohorts of the 9-11 hijackers at the Bin Laden command base, giggling and laughing and then getting serious and reading their solemn letter of how they're going to kill everybody.
[01:35:30.503 --> 01:35:43.857]  But the government obviously couldn't give a saw to go though of this latest tape that's been released and they claim the tape is being released to give orders to sleeper cells to attack us right in time for the election and of course to blame it on Iran and go to war.
[01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:45.599]  As I've been predicting they do.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.604]  We may be able to back them off though by speaking out against this and exposing it.
[01:35:50.976 --> 01:35:55.338]  But to make a long story short, we know Mohammed Adda and others left the U.S.
[01:35:55.398 --> 01:36:02.520]  right around this same time, went to a Malaysian terror summit, then stopped in Afghanistan, and then went back into the United States.
[01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:09.543]  And when two different embassy heads blocked them getting visas, the State Department called them and said, and I've interviewed these embassy heads, U.S.
[01:36:09.603 --> 01:36:11.184]  government officers, okay?
[01:36:11.984 --> 01:36:13.705]  And told them, let them back in.
[01:36:13.745 --> 01:36:17.406]  The terror designation on the computer is their CIA cover.
[01:36:17.486 --> 01:36:18.346]  These are officers.
[01:36:18.887 --> 01:36:19.567]  Doesn't stop there.
[01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:23.161]  I have of course covered the fact of the Sacramento Bee.
[01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.289]  The first place to report it was the
[01:36:26.864 --> 01:36:31.728]  San Jose Mercury News in the AP, the Dean of the Defense Language School went public and said, look, these guys were U.S.
[01:36:31.768 --> 01:36:32.349]  government agents.
[01:36:32.609 --> 01:36:36.572]  We were forced to train them in covert ops at our bases, in spy training.
[01:36:36.592 --> 01:36:40.855]  And then Pensacola News Journal, MSNBC reported they were trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:45.539]  And I got a bunch of other evidence, informants living with them, government credit cards, government-paid-for cars.
[01:36:45.779 --> 01:36:46.280]  They were U.S.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.004]  government agents set up, remote-controlled planes that were nerve-gassed on board, flown into the buildings.
[01:36:51.204 --> 01:36:52.104]  And that's the inside.
[01:36:52.325 --> 01:36:54.967]  The people at the Pentagon that told me that are the same ones that told me
[01:36:55.507 --> 01:36:58.129]  Rather 9-11, that the government was running drills that morning.
[01:36:58.489 --> 01:37:02.232]  I didn't know that was true for two years, then it came out in the Associated Press that the U.S.
[01:37:02.272 --> 01:37:06.835]  government was running drills of hijacked jets being flown to the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[01:37:07.095 --> 01:37:08.556]  That's the kind of sources I've got, folks.
[01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:09.537]  Well, here it is.
[01:37:09.877 --> 01:37:12.038]  The Laughing 9-11 Bombers, right on time.
[01:37:12.439 --> 01:37:17.582]  They can also show you Steve McQueen pitching for Ford Mustangs, even though he's been dead since 1981.
[01:37:17.642 --> 01:37:19.363]  It's all fake, folks.
[01:37:19.703 --> 01:37:23.406]  The Laughing 9-11 Bombers, film of the ringleader of September 11th hijackers.
[01:37:24.087 --> 01:37:32.243]  Reading his martyrdom will, inside Afghanistan at Osama Bin Laden's headquarters, has emerged five years after the Al Qaeda outrage.
[01:37:33.145 --> 01:37:33.546]  Ah yes.
[01:37:33.939 --> 01:37:34.740]  And then here's another one.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:38.643]  The President dubs alleged Perl killer MI6 agent.
[01:37:38.923 --> 01:37:43.648]  We already told you that Mr. Perl learned that Al-Qaeda was CIA controlled.
[01:37:43.708 --> 01:37:44.869]  I reported this three years ago.
[01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:47.551]  And so he was killed by globalist assets.
[01:37:47.931 --> 01:37:55.358]  And now Pakistani President General Perez Musharraf, who's getting paranoid, so he's going public, has disclosed that Omar Sheikh,
[01:37:55.718 --> 01:38:10.801]  who kidnapped and murdered American journalist Daniel Pearl is now facing death penalty was actually the British secret agents MI6 agent and had executed certain missions on their behest before coming to Pakistan and visiting Afghanistan to meet Osama Bin Laden and Mullah Omar
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:22.936]  Remember that Rashida Swat, the head of the London bombings, was also MI6, and John Loftus, former Justice Department Chief Anti-Terror Expert, works for ABC News, went public on that, and that's also declassified now.
[01:38:23.557 --> 01:38:27.802]  Here's another one, BBC, Pakistan roll in Muabi attacks.
[01:38:28.423 --> 01:38:36.709]  And the Pakistan Intelligence Agency was behind the train blast in Mumbai in July that killed 186 people Indian police say.
[01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:40.452]  And they did that, of course, on behest of MI6 to destabilize the region.
[01:38:40.612 --> 01:38:42.594]  That's British intel, the real folks that run things.
[01:38:42.894 --> 01:38:44.715]  James Bond's real folks, but he's a terrorist.
[01:38:44.975 --> 01:38:53.662]  Oh, by the way, two weeks ago I interviewed two top, one of them the former head of covert operations in Northern Ireland, the head, really, of the IRA.
[01:38:54.162 --> 01:39:04.667]  And reporting that IRA was run by British intelligence to stage the attacks as a pretext for military control of Northern Ireland and to set up a police state in England proper, particularly London.
[01:39:04.687 --> 01:39:06.508]  You see, who stands to gain from the terror?
[01:39:06.628 --> 01:39:07.649]  Who gets to take your rights?
[01:39:07.829 --> 01:39:09.029]  Who gets defense contracts?
[01:39:09.129 --> 01:39:10.250]  They're all starting to go public.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:17.201]  Mr. Ventura, I'm just going to tell you right off the bat, I became a big supporter of you
[01:39:39.855 --> 01:39:44.138]  I saw a clip online in the summer of 2003 when you were on Jay Leno.
[01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:44.879]  It was heartfelt.
[01:39:44.899 --> 01:39:45.840]  It was energy.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:46.640]  It was pure truth.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.982]  I saw you tell people, thanks for standing up for the truth.
[01:39:49.002 --> 01:39:49.883]  Thanks for standing up for what's right.
[01:39:50.223 --> 01:39:50.984]  You were on Jay Leno.
[01:39:51.004 --> 01:39:52.145]  You talked about Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:39:52.165 --> 01:39:53.286]  Since then it's been declassified.
[01:39:53.306 --> 01:39:53.866]  It was all stage.
[01:39:53.886 --> 01:39:54.707]  You obviously knew you were
[01:39:55.601 --> 01:39:56.602]  Inside all of that.
[01:39:57.082 --> 01:40:02.546]  I would just like to get your view, your take on 9-11, Gulf of Tonkin, JFK, all of that.
[01:40:03.447 --> 01:40:24.843]  Well, I think the most interesting thing to talk about today is if people aren't aware that due to the Freedom of Information Act, in the early 60s the Pentagon had an operation called Operation Northwoods and it never came to reality but it was on the table that
[01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:34.717]  Our military would attack certain cities within the United States and make it look like Cuba did it to justify an invasion of Cuba.
[01:40:35.358 --> 01:40:44.687]  It never happened, but just the simple fact that they contemplated it and it was actually on the table in the Pentagon, I find that just very disturbing.
[01:40:45.347 --> 01:40:49.331]  That they would, you know, even consider using our military to try to just
[01:40:50.174 --> 01:40:52.335]  To justify an invasion of another country.
[01:40:52.595 --> 01:41:00.877]  They did speak on Jay Leno according to my recollection about how Gulf of Tonkin was staged, how you were lied to, we were lied to, you lost a lot of friends.
[01:41:01.557 --> 01:41:08.618]  What was it like to learn that they had staged an event that didn't really happen to bring us into full-scale war in 64?
[01:41:09.139 --> 01:41:10.779]  What was it like when you realized that and you learned that?
[01:41:11.539 --> 01:41:17.123]  Well, it was very disappointing to believe in your country that they would lie to you to get into a war.
[01:41:17.703 --> 01:41:21.606]  That they would perpetrate a lie and that the media would go along with it.
[01:41:21.726 --> 01:41:22.987]  It's a real eye-opener.
[01:41:23.427 --> 01:41:27.009]  And you realize that if they would do it in the 60s, they'll do it again.
[01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:28.891]  If it works once, it'll work again.
[01:41:29.431 --> 01:41:31.692]  Government very much operates that way.
[01:41:32.893 --> 01:41:38.517]  I really learned about it when McNamara did his tour with film and he came to Harvard when I was teaching there.
[01:41:39.292 --> 01:41:43.576]  And they pretty much had to lock me up in a room so that I wouldn't confront him.
[01:41:43.596 --> 01:41:46.558]  What would you say to him if you were in a room with him?
[01:41:46.959 --> 01:41:50.301]  I would ask him why we were lied to and what the purpose was for it.
[01:41:51.302 --> 01:42:00.110]  The one thing I do question on 9-11 is the fact that if anyone's familiar with the Payne Stewart, the golfer, when he died,
[01:42:01.027 --> 01:42:24.305]  He was flying in a private plane and they lost contact with that private plane out of Florida and within 30 minutes they had a fighter jet up on the wing and that fighter stayed with it all the way till it crashed in Nebraska making sure that it didn't harm anyone and the thing I questioned on 9-11 was simply the fact where were our planes when all this was going on and planes were being
[01:42:25.143 --> 01:42:25.743]  Yeah, folks.
[01:42:25.783 --> 01:42:26.523]  We're out of time.
[01:42:26.583 --> 01:42:28.864]  Next week I'll air more of the interview.
[01:42:28.944 --> 01:42:29.484]  I promise.
[01:42:29.524 --> 01:42:30.444]  I meant to play more.
[01:42:30.484 --> 01:42:31.164]  That's the problem.
[01:42:31.684 --> 01:42:32.625]  We've got to go three hours.
[01:42:32.925 --> 01:42:34.905]  There's just not enough time with two hours.
[01:42:34.965 --> 01:42:36.045]  But in about a week and a half.
[01:42:36.065 --> 01:42:37.225]  Well, we already syndicated today.
[01:42:37.326 --> 01:42:40.766]  Full syndication with all the stations signing up in the next two weeks.
[01:42:40.966 --> 01:42:43.427]  And we've got calls here from Austin.
[01:42:43.447 --> 01:42:45.167]  We've got calls from Montana, Denver.
[01:42:46.247 --> 01:42:47.708]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason.
[01:42:48.108 --> 01:42:49.048]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:42:49.088 --> 01:42:49.408]  Go ahead.
[01:42:50.205 --> 01:42:52.888]  Hey Alex, we want to tell you you're doing a great job.
[01:42:52.928 --> 01:42:54.689]  I just wanted to bring up the point you were talking about before.
[01:42:54.889 --> 01:42:58.313]  How are they controlling all of these people running our democracy?
[01:42:58.613 --> 01:42:59.674]  You talk about Jeff Gannon.
[01:42:59.714 --> 01:43:04.939]  I mean, was that rubbing something in somebody's face at all of the press conferences saying you better keep your mouth shut?
[01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:06.420]  We know what's really going on.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.465]  Yeah, he like puts his hand on his neck and the president puts his cheek up against him and kisses him on the side of the head.
[01:43:11.705 --> 01:43:13.227]  There's something going on here that's just sick.
[01:43:14.598 --> 01:43:17.120]  Well, I mean, regardless, maybe Bush was just having fun.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.381]  But we know a bunch of these other people.
[01:43:19.521 --> 01:43:22.703]  It's totally out of control, and it's really scary.
[01:43:22.723 --> 01:43:23.624]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:24.044 --> 01:43:33.049]  John in Montana, you're going live from the studios of NewsRadio 590, Gilbert J. Hey, Alex, I'm going to let you know I've been pushing snooze on my alarm clock for about five years now.
[01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:38.092]  Finally watched Terror Storm, watched all your videos, actually, and pulled that alarm clock out of my wall.
[01:43:38.152 --> 01:43:38.873]  I'm awake now.
[01:43:39.505 --> 01:43:41.107]  And I want to say, I want to ask you a couple questions.
[01:43:41.127 --> 01:43:46.914]  First, I want to know if on your website if you can put up some brochures, some flyers, something that we across the country can all download.
[01:43:46.934 --> 01:43:47.415]  That's a good idea.
[01:43:47.455 --> 01:43:48.356]  We need to do the flyers.
[01:43:48.496 --> 01:43:49.638]  We need to do the flyers.
[01:43:50.239 --> 01:43:51.400]  Yeah, flyers on the website.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.480]  I'll put those down and people can print those out.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:58.603]  And the second thing I want to ask every American out there that is awake right now, what are we waiting for people?
[01:43:58.903 --> 01:44:00.203]  I mean, they're attacking us daily.
[01:44:00.484 --> 01:44:01.264]  We know what's going on.
[01:44:01.304 --> 01:44:02.605]  What's the position going to work?
[01:44:02.745 --> 01:44:04.585]  They just butchered the entire Bill of Rights.
[01:44:04.605 --> 01:44:05.526]  You're absolutely right.
[01:44:05.586 --> 01:44:06.226]  Last caller.
[01:44:06.546 --> 01:44:08.827]  Greg, you've got ten seconds.
[01:44:08.847 --> 01:44:09.608]  You're on KLBJ.
[01:44:09.688 --> 01:44:10.008]  Go ahead.
[01:44:10.588 --> 01:44:10.828]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:10.848 --> 01:44:14.650]  I would like to know if you believe in the Islamic movement or the Islamic terrorists.
[01:44:15.586 --> 01:44:16.567]  I don't know what that means.
[01:44:16.627 --> 01:44:18.608]  You mean because I don't buy into the fable?
[01:44:19.168 --> 01:44:23.231]  Because I know that radical Islam was funded and created by our own government?
[01:44:23.271 --> 01:44:24.432]  That's just mainstream history?
[01:44:24.652 --> 01:44:27.694]  And I know that all these other real terrorists are handled by our government?
[01:44:27.734 --> 01:44:29.975]  I just read a bunch of documents and admissions to you.
[01:44:30.776 --> 01:44:34.939]  No, I don't believe in the rare, organic terrorism that takes place.
[01:44:35.219 --> 01:44:35.919]  I think it's terrible!
[01:44:36.119 --> 01:44:39.421]  But I'm mad at the terrorists in our government that are setting up a North American Union right now!
[01:44:39.742 --> 01:44:40.582]  Shift your paradigm!
[01:44:40.622 --> 01:44:41.603]  God bless you next week!
[01:44:42.023 --> 01:44:43.204]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.304 --> 01:44:48.128]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.228 --> 01:44:51.110]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:55.274]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.574 --> 01:45:01.599]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:01.779 --> 01:45:03.340]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.762]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:13.158 --> 01:45:14.159]  Looking for profits?
[01:45:14.239 --> 01:45:15.640]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:19.183]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:19.223 --> 01:45:26.789]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:26.849 --> 01:45:30.392]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:30.592 --> 01:45:32.114]  Secure your position today.
[01:45:32.414 --> 01:45:33.635]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:33.675 --> 01:45:33.935]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
