[00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:06.196]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:07.916]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:09.716]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.177]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:12.917]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:17.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:21.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:45.499]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this live Thursday edition, the first day of June 2006.
[00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.442]  We are now 23 days away from the big conference in Los Angeles, California, the big 9-11 conference.
[00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:57.063]  We're looking at about a thousand people that are going to be there.
[00:00:57.163 --> 00:00:58.664]  It's going to be the biggest and best ever.
[00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:06.246]  We hope to see you there as we expose the entire NEOCON agenda, not just 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:10.168]  I'll be jumping on an airplane this evening, flying to Chicago.
[00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:13.649]  And I'll be there for a big 9-11 conference, one of their keynote speakers.
[00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:14.690]  I'm honored to be a part of that.
[00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030]  There's still time to get tickets to that online.
[00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.672]  So we'll tell you more about that later as well.
[00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.272]  Big broadcast lined up for you.
[00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:23.833]  We are scheduled later in the show.
[00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:34.661]  Later in this hour to have a state rep on who was instrumental in introducing the legislation that was signed by the governor yesterday in Wisconsin banning forced microchipping.
[00:01:35.102 --> 00:01:42.705]  We're also scheduled to have a two-star general on who said that America is turning into a police state and that we're losing our
[00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:47.084]  enshrined values of a free republic.
[00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:50.284]  He's scheduled to join us coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:58.906]  In the meantime, the media is trying to spin, the neocon media, is trying to spin one of these confirmed massacres of men, women, and children.
[00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:05.107]  They've been putting out other fake reports to confuse people and try to claim that this one is fake.
[00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:10.568]  And I want to play a little ABC news piece concerning this coming up later in the hour as well.
[00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:14.896]  Really amazing story that broke yesterday while we were on air.
[00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:17.981]  We mentioned it and talked a little bit about it, but I want to spend more time today.
[00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:20.684]  Court rules no whistleblower free speech right.
[00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:27.113]  Now the same Supreme Court late last year ruled that there is no private property in America.
[00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:28.836]  In the New London, Connecticut case,
[00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:36.874]  They rule that if a private interest wants to lobby City Hall to take your property, and in this specific case, without just compensation.
[00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:39.995]  That's the added little caveat the mainstream news wouldn't tell you about.
[00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:43.697]  Ninety-nine percent of Americans in major polls were against the ruling.
[00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.618]  Yes, actual Gallup poll at ninety-nine percent.
[00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:48.639]  Another CNN poll at ninety-nine percent.
[00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.800]  They don't care.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.523]  It doesn't matter if it's unconstitutional.
[00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.545]  99% of us don't like it.
[00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:56.409]  There's that 1% that want to rob and rule over us.
[00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:01.697]  This isn't where the government takes land to build a sports stadium or a highway and then gives you just compensation.
[00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:03.162]  No, no, no.
[00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:18.816]  This is where private interest lobby, they would set it in the ruling and want your land and they take it and then they condemn your say $306,000 house in one case, three-story colonial home with an entire middle-class computer programming family with the grandparents living upstairs.
[00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:26.723]  Then they give you $61,000 or was it $62,000 and say, we're just giving you the lot value and not even best price.
[00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:30.752]  Because you fought us, you didn't sell to us.
[00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:32.473]  I've now digressed.
[00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:36.534]  The point is, another incredible ruling from the same criminal court.
[00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:41.896]  Now remember, the Supreme Court has ruled that black people aren't human beings in the past.
[00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:44.024]  And that was the, quote, law of the land.
[00:03:44.084 --> 00:03:45.365]  No, it is not the law of the land.
[00:03:45.705 --> 00:04:02.077]  Marbury v. Madison, many other rulings, when a court, a federal state, it doesn't matter, violates the Constitution in a flagrant matter, their rulings are null and void, just like official congressional laws, saying black people aren't human beings, are null and void.
[00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:05.519]  It's all null and void, and I'm not following it!
[00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.081]  They can announce tomorrow, I gotta turn my guns in!
[00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:09.382]  Listen, you're crooks!
[00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:13.628]  They can announce Bush is allowed to barbecue small children on the White House lawn!
[00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:14.669]  It's illegal!
[00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.890]  You're crooks!
[00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.672]  You're not God, and you can't say... Listen.
[00:04:19.372 --> 00:04:24.916]  They've been prosecuting people that blow the whistle on bid-rigging, war profiteering, corruption, rapes.
[00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:32.981]  And we've got federal officials raping secretaries on their desks now, and witnesses catch them, and nothing happens.
[00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:39.265]  I mean, these are the cases, ladies and gentlemen, or Able Danger, where they order Defense Intelligence not to stop Al-Cieda.
[00:04:40.453 --> 00:04:47.879]  And then they go burn the colonel that goes public for $65 of phone calls to his wife on the government cell phone, which he was allowed to do.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.021]  They start charging, you know, going after him.
[00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:54.805]  Well, yeah, they say it's illegal to blow the whistle.
[00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.647]  It's illegal to report corruption.
[00:04:57.388 --> 00:05:00.010]  Is there any question, any doubt criminals are running things?
[00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:09.788]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:12.331]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[00:05:12.932 --> 00:05:21.782]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:22.282 --> 00:05:25.804]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:05:26.264 --> 00:05:47.053]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:47.353 --> 00:05:51.075]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:51.315]  Yes.
[00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:52.876]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:23.670]  The MPG Cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.

[00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:07.325]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.787 --> 00:08:18.196]  All right, on this live June 1st, 2006, Thursday edition, we've got two-star Major General Carl D. Black
[00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:25.897]  Coming on in the second hour to talk about America turning into a police state and how our values are being dismantled, another general going public.
[00:08:26.418 --> 00:08:32.704]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll also get into the latest confirmed Marine Corps massacre in Iraq.
[00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:37.368]  In the past, they would have charged these people immediately and then this wouldn't be a big scandal.
[00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.991]  Murtha is right, and people are calling him a traitor, the congressman, for decrying this.
[00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:43.151]  It's outrageous!
[00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:44.992]  It's outrageous to defend this!
[00:08:45.532 --> 00:08:58.114]  And one Fox News commentator did say it was bad, and people are starting to commend him, and I saw on a message board, they said this is like commending someone for saying it's wrong to walk up to strangers and stab them in the face.
[00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:00.095]  And this is what should be expected.
[00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:03.456]  It shouldn't be, oh wow, someone's against evil.
[00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:05.176]  Man, let's commend them!
[00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.861]  So, we'll get into all of that as well.
[00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:12.064]  This unbelievable Supreme Court ruling that doesn't protect whistleblowers.
[00:09:12.264 --> 00:09:16.388]  Just every sign of corruption gone to seed is with us.
[00:09:16.448 --> 00:09:17.889]  But some good news, there is some good news.
[00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:20.131]  For those that don't know, just a brief background.
[00:09:21.392 --> 00:09:27.257]  Mexican Attorney General a year and a half ago said his 163 top employees had to take microchips for no job.
[00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:29.522]  We have U.S.
[00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:31.643]  companies saying they want their employees to take chips.
[00:09:31.663 --> 00:09:36.066]  We have nightclubs getting into the VIP areas with the go-go dancers.
[00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:36.987]  You've got to take chips.
[00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:39.648]  We've had those CEOs on, the heads of those clubs on.
[00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:43.071]  We've had the head of Applied Digital on saying they do want everyone to take chips.
[00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:45.172]  They want the immigrants to take chips now.
[00:09:45.232 --> 00:09:46.513]  They want everyone to take chips.
[00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:54.098]  I had the police chief of Bergen County, New Jersey on, it's a big county, saying he thinks everyone should be made to take chips last year.
[00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:56.880]  So this is real.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.341]  This is really going on.
[00:09:58.381 --> 00:09:59.362]  This is really happening.
[00:09:59.422 --> 00:10:06.548]  My cousin, 18 years in Special Forces, he's now in Logistics, an officer, an enlisted officer who's moved to the ranks.
[00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:09.751]  They were told two years ago they will be forced to take chips within two years.
[00:10:10.052 --> 00:10:10.852]  Two years has passed.
[00:10:10.892 --> 00:10:13.214]  It hasn't happened yet, but they're telling him it's coming soon.
[00:10:13.254 --> 00:10:15.176]  So, and congressmen are proposing this.
[00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:15.817]  This is happening.
[00:10:16.237 --> 00:10:19.139]  Well, the good news is I have the Associated Press here in front of me from yesterday.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.923]  Doyle signs bill outlawing mandatory microchip implants.
[00:10:23.363 --> 00:10:27.546]  The bill was sponsored by Representative Marlon Schneider, Democrat, Wisconsin Rapids.
[00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:30.668]  Said the law was needed to stop anyone from being forced to get implants.
[00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:32.389]  Violators will face fines up to $10,000.
[00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:39.594]  Because we now have people trying to force... We got two Latin American presidents saying they want to make people take chips.
[00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:41.434]  This is really happening.
[00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:45.756]  And Representative from the 72nd Assembly District is a Democrat.
[00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:48.717]  And we're glad to have the same person on the air with us.
[00:10:49.017 --> 00:10:51.098]  Thank you for coming on, Representative.
[00:10:51.378 --> 00:10:52.198]  Nice to be with you.
[00:10:52.358 --> 00:10:53.239]  Thank you for having me.
[00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:53.799]  You bet.
[00:10:53.859 --> 00:10:57.560]  Tell us, some people in the national news that make jokes about this.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.500]  Why make a joke?
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.221]  I mean, your Governor didn't consider it a joke.
[00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:01.601]  You didn't consider it a joke.
[00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.142]  Why were you forced to do this?
[00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:16.516]  Well, I read some articles early on that this was being contemplated, and I have been working for a couple decades in our legislature on issues of individual rights of privacy, and they are being eroded.
[00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:21.939]  And this new microchip technology is even worse than Orwell ever even imagined.
[00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:25.440]  And so I introduced a bill about a year and a half ago.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.462]  It languished in committee for quite some time, but it finally got support.
[00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:32.323]  It passed the state assembly unanimously in Wisconsin.
[00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.917]  And it passed the Senate 32 to 1.
[00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:39.713]  So it had very widespread both philosophical and bipartisan support.
[00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:45.503]  Do you ever feel like you've woken up in a science fiction movie or in the Twilight Zone when they're all over TV?
[00:11:45.523 --> 00:11:49.986]  I don't know if you've seen this, but Sean Hannity and others say, yes, everyone needs a chip.
[00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:54.808]  I've seen dozens, probably a hundred TV reports saying how great it is.
[00:11:54.828 --> 00:11:57.330]  I mean, is that what spurred you seeing all these reports?
[00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.853]  No, but Sean Hannity should probably have his chip so that he can be tracked and monitored wherever he goes.
[00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:10.417]  But I don't think that the people of Wisconsin, or the people of the United States for that matter, want microchips in
[00:12:11.016 --> 00:12:15.300]  Either their products or in their bodies.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.121]  Oh, that's key!
[00:12:17.181 --> 00:12:23.587]  California is very close to passing a law restricting unlabeled RFIDs, so you're informed about that?
[00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:36.598]  I'm not informed about the California bill, but it's an issue that if I'm re-elected I would certainly like to take up next time so that people are aware that they can be tracked and monitored not only with an implantable chip, but with one that
[00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:37.749]  I think so.
[00:12:55.976 --> 00:13:07.304]  And that anybody who violates this subsection of our law would be subject to a $10,000 fine, and each day that a person had this chip implanted in them without their consent would be a separate violation.
[00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:22.576]  Sir, what do you think of the, and he's been in the national news, you can just type in Bergen County Sheriff says chips are needed and it'll pop up, but I mean, what's your take on people who say that we should start the forced chipping now, and then act like we're weird because we're against it?
[00:13:23.229 --> 00:13:36.378]  Well, I think that those people had better re-examine their own position on that, because that is what will lead to a surveillance society, and as you mentioned, your General, a police state.
[00:13:37.238 --> 00:13:52.528]  Certainly police officers would find such a technology as useful, I suppose, in tracking criminals and tracking sex predators and other sorts of evildoers, but when you put it into everybody and you track everyone, and that's their ultimate goal,
[00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:59.700]  Then you have eroded freedom, the freedom to travel, the freedom to move, the freedom to purchase goods.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:09.903]  I should think that the National Rifle Association should be very interested in this issue and ought to be clamoring at the gate that if people chip firearms
[00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:12.941]  It amounts to more than simple gun registration.
[00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:17.445]  It allows for the tracking of that particular device or individual bullet.
[00:14:17.665 --> 00:14:18.866]  You just hit the nail on the head.
[00:14:19.286 --> 00:14:29.094]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but several states, including New York, are considering smart gun legislation to force RFID into all guns sold in those states.
[00:14:29.714 --> 00:14:37.742]  Well, I think that would be a disaster, and it certainly ought to be something that groups like the National Rifle Association ought to be concerned about.
[00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:44.669]  It goes way beyond issues like concealed carry or something like that, which has been a big issue in my state.
[00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:46.811]  So this isn't an issue on the horizon.
[00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:54.058]  We're now facing these decisions, and I commend you for, more than anything, raising the awareness level that this is really happening.
[00:14:54.781 --> 00:14:59.865]  Well, it certainly is happening and we're asking now whether or not this has happened in Wisconsin.
[00:14:59.905 --> 00:15:01.926]  We don't know of any specific instances here.
[00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:09.472]  I've got a call into University of Wisconsin hospitals to see if they have implanted any chips into anybody for any particular reason whatsoever.
[00:15:10.013 --> 00:15:14.656]  And you've got to keep in mind that in some cases these chips can provide a benefit.
[00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:23.563]  That is, for people who voluntarily want to be chipped, for example, to monitor their blood pressure or to monitor their blood sugar if they're diabetic,
[00:15:24.025 --> 00:15:25.347]  There are some positive things.
[00:15:25.387 --> 00:15:36.162]  That's the problem with all these technologies is that they have, on the one hand, a good purpose for which they can be utilized, and then there are the downsides that I think that many of us are concerned about.
[00:15:36.182 --> 00:15:40.568]  Well, you're right, and out-of-the-gate supply digital solutions, one of the big front companies of IBM,
[00:15:41.528 --> 00:15:42.708]  IBM really owns their debt, folks.
[00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:43.248]  It's a front.
[00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:46.069]  And I had that from their own financial filings from two years ago.
[00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.830]  That out of the gates, they're saying, we want to make people take this.
[00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.150]  We want to make school kids take it.
[00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.510]  We want to make the old take it.
[00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.791]  We want to make the immigrants take it.
[00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:56.071]  Out of the gates, they're talking about it being forced.
[00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:57.771]  Well, of course they are.
[00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.332]  And there's big money that's involved.
[00:15:59.812 --> 00:16:05.053]  And that's why, you know, we need even more campaign finance reform in Washington.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:15.842]  And we need more people, frankly, like my United States Senator, Russ Feingold, who was one to look at the Patriot Act and say that there were civil liberties violations.
[00:16:16.622 --> 00:16:21.703]  Nobody else in the whole United States Senate had the courage to do that and to look at issues like that.
[00:16:22.183 --> 00:16:25.023]  But Congress needs to take a look broader than that.
[00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:28.664]  They need to take a look at where these technologies are leading us.
[00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:33.105]  And in order to do that, they're not going to do that as long as there are big bucks involved.
[00:16:33.165 --> 00:16:34.985]  And RFID has a potential
[00:16:35.663 --> 00:16:38.485]  A worldwide impact of like a hundred billion dollars.
[00:16:50.953 --> 00:16:54.736]  Well that's certainly true and what I worry about even with my little bill is that these people who talk about states' rights
[00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:25.480]  Especially in Washington, then when they get there, they just violate states' rights and that they will preempt even our little law here in Wisconsin by federal mandate.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:32.186]  Wisconsin, back in the 19th century, was actually the first state to consider secession.
[00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:40.058]  That wasn't South Carolina or Texas or anywhere, it was Wisconsin, and it was because we refused to obey the Fugitive Slave Act and the Dred Scott decision.
[00:17:40.338 --> 00:17:40.598]  Yes.
[00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:51.470]  I think that the states need to collectively, that state legislatures across this country have got to pass these laws, and that Congress ought not to meddle in the passage of these laws.
[00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.573]  Well, let me shift gears, talking about states' rights.
[00:17:54.473 --> 00:18:00.676]  When we know Bloomberg's a federal minion there in New York, the mayor is proposing a forced DNA database of all workers.
[00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:06.078]  He piggybacks it on the popular plan to control illegal aliens, which I support, but it has nothing to do with that.
[00:18:06.098 --> 00:18:08.399]  You read what he just proposed three days ago.
[00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:15.303]  It says all workers' DNA databases and other states through federal mandates are moving to do that, including California.
[00:18:16.003 --> 00:18:18.424]  Well, and that's unfortunate, too, and that's an issue that
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.621]  I've tried to address in Wisconsin.
[00:18:20.741 --> 00:18:27.225]  It's difficult to get legislators interested in these long-term issues, like DNA databases.
[00:18:27.485 --> 00:18:33.088]  When our current governor was Attorney General of this state, he was promoting these DNA databases.
[00:18:33.168 --> 00:18:38.631]  But, you know, for criminal behaviors and tracking down certain individuals, that's the positive.
[00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:40.372]  But not everybody, not the law body.
[00:18:40.392 --> 00:18:43.454]  You've got to be convicted first, or at least held on a serious crime.
[00:18:43.474 --> 00:18:43.854]  Do you agree?
[00:18:43.894 --> 00:18:44.755]  I agree with that.
[00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:46.496]  And the problem that I have is that
[00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:56.753]  Even in those cases, there have to be strict controls because access to the DNA database can be used by insurance companies to discriminate in the delivery of health care.
[00:18:56.793 --> 00:18:59.014]  By the way, that's already happening, as I'm sure you know.
[00:18:59.454 --> 00:19:00.895]  Sir, a quick break.
[00:19:00.935 --> 00:19:02.916]  Can I hold you over about five more minutes on the other side?
[00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:05.636]  Yeah, just to the bottom of the hour, because I've got a few other questions.
[00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:06.697]  You bring up states' rights.
[00:19:07.117 --> 00:19:09.757]  The states are right to secede.
[00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:16.498]  I don't mean a full secession, but reasserting their 10th Amendment rights, and of course to the people as well.
[00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:18.819]  And look at the Supreme Court rulings.
[00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:21.879]  Private interests can take your private property if they lobby the city.
[00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:24.080]  99% in polls against that.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.561]  Then we have this new Supreme Court ruling yesterday that whistleblowers have no protection when they report crime.
[00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:32.012]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[00:19:32.453 --> 00:19:33.133]  This is insane.
[00:19:33.153 --> 00:19:34.473]  I mean, this is scary, folks.
[00:19:35.514 --> 00:19:44.516]  And we're talking about cases of, like, able danger, where defense intelligence is told by Bush, back off Bin Laden's, back off Hamas, and then he blows the whistle.
[00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:51.518]  They're trying to charge him now for $65 in cell phone calls to his wife off his government phone, which everybody knows you're allowed to do.
[00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:54.159]  I mean, and he doesn't have any protection now, you see?
[00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:55.700]  He's gonna get fired.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.941]  He's gonna get demoted for trying to stop terrorist attacks.
[00:19:58.961 --> 00:19:59.561]  We'll be right back.

[00:23:57.516 --> 00:23:58.297]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:58.357 --> 00:24:05.259]  Marlon Schneider, Representative, 72nd Assembly District, Democrat, from Wisconsin, joins us.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.402]  It's gotten so bad we're having to get laws passed against forced microchipping.
[00:24:18.422 --> 00:24:25.606]  I remember four years ago, Reuters reported the Bureau of Prisons in California signed a deal to start chipping their prisoners.
[00:24:25.646 --> 00:24:28.028]  That was in Reuters and then it hit the news and they backtracked.
[00:24:28.348 --> 00:24:29.449]  So they're really trying this.
[00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:32.430]  My cousin in the military has been told they're getting chips.
[00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:33.711]  And he's an officer.
[00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:36.107]  I mean, this is really happening.
[00:24:36.687 --> 00:24:39.869]  Representative Schneider, getting into some of the other things, you mentioned states' rights.
[00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:48.374]  Give us your take on these crazy Supreme Court rulings where they openly say robber barons locally can take your land if they wanted.
[00:24:48.434 --> 00:24:50.335]  I mean, we're going back to feudalism here.
[00:24:51.336 --> 00:25:00.441]  Well, certainly that decision created a lot of concern in virtually all the states, and some states have laws that would prohibit that kind of activity or have
[00:25:01.637 --> 00:25:11.364]  effective controls over the private taking for private purposes rather than a public taking for a public purpose, which is what eminent domain provides.
[00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:18.128]  And so it just depends on the specific circumstances and the specific laws in any given state.
[00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:26.694]  I don't know that we should get too excited about that case because I believe that the states are able to respond to that and have been.
[00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.231]  My point is, it shows the mentality of this Supreme Court.
[00:25:33.791 --> 00:25:55.696]  Well, one can always argue about the Supreme Court, and as a country we always have, whether it was FDR trying to pack the court, or whether it was the Warren Court and the concerns that were expressed in those days about that court, whether it was the Rehnquist Court and the direction that they moved, and all sorts of people always, because we're a free society, we have the
[00:25:57.563 --> 00:26:09.274]  The wonderful opportunity to complain and to try to change those laws either by constitutional amendment, by statute, or by additional court cases in the future.
[00:26:09.474 --> 00:26:11.816]  Well, there's also the jury box and the grand jury box.
[00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:15.579]  That's another vote we have to judge the facts as well as the law.
[00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:18.283]  Now, I wanted to shift gears here.
[00:26:18.303 --> 00:26:19.224]  I'm sure you're aware of this.
[00:26:19.785 --> 00:26:28.497]  Your last governor proposed, what, three years ago, using the cell phones, which by federal law starting in 2001, October 1st, are tracked down to a few feet.
[00:26:29.173 --> 00:26:31.074]  And they want to use that system at the state level.
[00:26:31.094 --> 00:26:32.514]  Wisconsin was the first to announce it.
[00:26:32.534 --> 00:26:33.975]  I was wondering where that was at.
[00:26:34.015 --> 00:26:36.736]  I saw it in the Green Bay News paper a few years ago.
[00:26:37.176 --> 00:26:45.479]  To have the emergency management centers in live time with the sheriffs and police departments tracking all the cell phones by name in real time.
[00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:52.021]  And now we've heard Kansas and Wyoming and others are saying they're going to use it for traffic regulation to see where cars are.
[00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:53.762]  I mean tracking us in real time.
[00:26:53.802 --> 00:26:55.943]  That makes the NSA spying look tame.
[00:26:55.963 --> 00:26:56.683]  Can you comment on that?
[00:26:57.283 --> 00:27:05.647]  Well, Wisconsin has been engaged in the process of what's called Enhanced 911, which allows for tracking of cell phones.
[00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:09.448]  Again, this is another of those technologies where it's a two-edged sword.
[00:27:09.568 --> 00:27:11.569]  On the one hand, you can track and monitor everybody.
[00:27:12.522 --> 00:27:17.186]  Mostly, I think what they wanted for is when people get lost and you're able to pinpoint and track them.
[00:27:17.206 --> 00:27:26.133]  There was a case, I believe, in North or South Dakota where somebody was lost during a blizzard and the ability to be able to pinpoint that... No, I know, sir.
[00:27:26.153 --> 00:27:27.714]  I know it has all these wonderful uses.
[00:27:27.754 --> 00:27:30.496]  The point is that I've read the federal documents.
[00:27:30.556 --> 00:27:31.697]  I remember ten years ago,
[00:27:32.649 --> 00:27:39.053]  On air in 96 when they passed the federal law to implement this by 2001, in the next five years they did it.
[00:27:39.693 --> 00:27:44.116]  And sir, all I'm saying is that they mean to use this to totally control us.
[00:27:44.476 --> 00:27:48.978]  In fact, in there they have the technology to dial in and actually use it as a microphone to listen to you.
[00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:56.002]  And that's very scary and certainly we don't want that to happen.
[00:27:56.123 --> 00:27:56.723]  There's another
[00:27:57.253 --> 00:27:59.416]  There are a couple other things that are going on too.
[00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:08.888]  Wisconsin was the first state to ban the use of photo radar, which is another insidious technology that the state of Illinois is now using in their tollway system with fines from $375 to $1,000.
[00:28:11.804 --> 00:28:15.325]  For somebody who may be speeding through a construction zone on the Illinois tollway.
[00:28:15.385 --> 00:28:21.527]  And Wisconsin was a state to ban that technology because of its insidious nature and its bad kind of law enforcement.
[00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:27.829]  Well, it's been thrown out in state and federal courts from California to Wisconsin because you have to have an officer there with a citation.
[00:28:27.869 --> 00:28:33.691]  I mean, to have Lockheed Martin running the cameras in San Diego or wherever, private corporation can't do that.
[00:28:34.241 --> 00:28:41.604]  Well, I understand, but we were the first state to ban that technology and now to put controls over microchip technology.
[00:28:42.024 --> 00:28:54.228]  But one of the things that is of concern to me is that people also want to put satellite-based technology into every vehicle so that they'll be able to track us wherever we go because of the ad valorem gasoline tax.
[00:28:55.055 --> 00:28:59.196]  And the decline in consumption that is going to ensue from the increased price.
[00:28:59.216 --> 00:28:59.736]  Oh, that's right!
[00:28:59.776 --> 00:29:07.698]  In fact, I had a Wisconsin congressman on about five, six years ago who first learned of the federal plan for the tollway gas tax with satellite.
[00:29:07.718 --> 00:29:08.338]  Was that you?
[00:29:09.098 --> 00:29:09.918]  No, that wasn't me.
[00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:10.618]  I wasn't on.
[00:29:11.418 --> 00:29:13.719]  I had somebody else on who first alerted us to that.
[00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:16.539]  So, for listeners, that's another real danger.
[00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:18.160]  Yeah, it certainly is.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.340]  And Wisconsin's Department of Transportation
[00:29:21.002 --> 00:29:38.973]  I was participating with, I think, six or seven other states in the development of that technology so that a person might want to drive from Wisconsin into Minnesota, then south to Iowa, then east to Illinois and back home, you'd get a bill from each state for the amount of time that you spent using their road.
[00:29:39.174 --> 00:29:41.215]  And where is that in Wisconsin now?
[00:29:41.595 --> 00:29:46.678]  Well, it's not implemented for sure, but they're doing the study and I don't know where it's at.
[00:29:46.838 --> 00:29:47.499]  Got to cut it there.
[00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:48.359]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:29:48.379 --> 00:29:49.240]  Thanks for your legislation.
[00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:50.965]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.825 --> 00:29:52.746]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:54.906]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.946 --> 00:29:58.547]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.648 --> 00:30:10.171]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.212]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.412 --> 00:30:13.552]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.939 --> 00:30:20.024]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:30:20.305 --> 00:30:23.968]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:31:01.664 --> 00:31:07.886]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.046 --> 00:31:14.208]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.488 --> 00:31:22.931]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:30.173]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.493 --> 00:31:35.316]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.536 --> 00:31:40.940]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.362]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.683 --> 00:31:52.648]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.708 --> 00:31:53.288]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:01.474]  I think so.
[00:32:21.954 --> 00:32:22.314]  I think so.
[00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:45.982]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.569 --> 00:33:14.592]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:14.632 --> 00:33:15.493]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:15.533 --> 00:33:16.794]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:16.854 --> 00:33:18.255]  We're here live.
[00:33:18.855 --> 00:33:21.418]  And of course back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:21.438 --> 00:33:24.480]  I'm going to plunge into the massacre news.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.564]  One of the well-known massacres that's been reported on going on over in Iraq by our glorious forces.
[00:33:31.006 --> 00:33:32.046]  You see, I support our military.
[00:33:32.067 --> 00:33:33.708]  I don't support them being turned into demons.
[00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:36.100]  And doing bad things.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.322]  And if we accept that, we become as worse as anybody in history.
[00:33:40.662 --> 00:33:41.883]  That's coming up in a bunch of other news.
[00:33:41.923 --> 00:33:42.904]  And of course, your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:49.928]  We're scheduled to have a two-star general talking about America turning into a police state, losing our sovereignty.
[00:33:50.308 --> 00:33:53.910]  Another individual going public blowing the whistle coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.972]  Before I do that, a couple of little program notes.
[00:33:59.253 --> 00:34:02.775]  Now is the time to become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:07.718]  All 14 of my films in low bandwidth and high bandwidth downloads and streams.
[00:34:08.419 --> 00:34:10.920]  Great activist tool to burn them on CD and give them to people.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.421]  Great way to spread the word.
[00:34:12.541 --> 00:34:13.682]  Great way to take action.
[00:34:14.002 --> 00:34:16.883]  An army of you out there taking action is unstoppable.
[00:34:17.184 --> 00:34:17.784]  Please do it!
[00:34:19.227 --> 00:34:33.578]  My book, you can print copies off, Paul Watson's book, read it right there on the site, a bunch of other e-books that are out there, a bunch of other films we've been authorized to post, hundreds of my weekly TV reports, dozens and dozens of special reports from England to Canada, and coming up, I'm going to Bilderberg Group next week.
[00:34:33.598 --> 00:34:40.804]  When I get back, we will take, within a week of getting back, key clips, key raw footage that's good, and just dump it on there for you to see it.
[00:34:42.327 --> 00:34:48.913]  And when I go to the Chicago conference, some of the interviews, my keynote speech, that'll all go up on the web next week.
[00:34:48.933 --> 00:34:50.034]  Just the whole speech up there.
[00:34:50.854 --> 00:34:53.937]  That's the kind of stuff you get being a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:34:53.977 --> 00:34:57.260]  Then you can take it and download it and burn it and get it out to people.
[00:34:58.201 --> 00:34:59.242]  It's so effective.
[00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:01.163]  It's having such a huge effect.
[00:35:02.004 --> 00:35:02.504]  15 cents a day.
[00:35:02.524 --> 00:35:03.505]  It just pays for the bandwidth.
[00:35:03.946 --> 00:35:08.950]  We put a lot of stuff out for free and frankly those of you that pay for the exclusive access to everything,
[00:35:09.366 --> 00:35:09.727]  We're good to go!
[00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:29.133]  Or not three dollars.
[00:35:29.173 --> 00:35:30.154]  Get three months free.
[00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:30.654]  Excuse me.
[00:35:30.974 --> 00:35:32.034]  Say a lot more than three dollars.
[00:35:32.054 --> 00:35:33.715]  Something like fifteen, sixteen bucks.
[00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:34.055]  I don't know.
[00:35:34.895 --> 00:35:39.837]  By getting a yearly membership you get three months free and it's been up over two years.
[00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:40.037]  What?
[00:35:40.097 --> 00:35:42.558]  Two years and three months now.
[00:35:43.178 --> 00:35:45.839]  So PrisonPlanet.tv just gets bigger and better.
[00:35:45.859 --> 00:35:47.460]  We just increased the size of the servers.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.521]  So it's even during peak times it doesn't slow down for you.
[00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:52.462]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:52.482 --> 00:35:53.062]  And then of course
[00:35:54.514 --> 00:36:00.345]  If you want hard copy, high quality DVD or VHS copies of all my films or other great films we carry...
[00:36:01.218 --> 00:36:03.500]  They're available at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.741]  Great books like 9-11 Synthetic Terror.
[00:36:05.801 --> 00:36:10.164]  Great 9-11 films like the one that George Humphreys put out.
[00:36:10.184 --> 00:36:11.725]  9-11 The Great Illusion.
[00:36:11.785 --> 00:36:12.906]  Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:36:12.966 --> 00:36:13.926]  Get that while you can.
[00:36:14.647 --> 00:36:18.129]  It's all there for you at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:18.149 --> 00:36:22.112]  Your purchase also makes this broadcast and what we do here possible.
[00:36:22.172 --> 00:36:23.733]  Get the original films I produced.
[00:36:23.793 --> 00:36:24.453]  I'm begging you.
[00:36:24.853 --> 00:36:25.874]  Get them and make copies.
[00:36:25.914 --> 00:36:28.256]  If you already have them and haven't made copies, what's stopping you?
[00:36:28.276 --> 00:36:28.656]  Please!
[00:36:29.136 --> 00:36:34.121]  Give them to police chiefs, county commissioners, your pastor, your rabbi, your imam, whatever.
[00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:37.444]  Give it to opinion makers, professors, school teachers.
[00:36:37.804 --> 00:36:41.468]  A lot of school teachers have had this as curriculum and they've been commended.
[00:36:41.808 --> 00:36:42.769]  Some have gotten in trouble.
[00:36:43.089 --> 00:36:44.851]  People have shown them at universities.
[00:36:45.431 --> 00:36:46.371]  It's so effective.
[00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:50.332]  I want to commend those that have been aiding us in the fight against the New World Order on the front lines.
[00:36:50.372 --> 00:36:52.893]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't to get involved now.
[00:36:53.213 --> 00:36:54.513]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:36:54.593 --> 00:36:57.014]  Order hard copies opposite your online shopping cart.
[00:36:57.314 --> 00:36:59.015]  Look at all the big specials we've got.

[00:37:00.275 --> 00:37:02.595]  DVD films as low as $5.95.
[00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:08.437]  We've slashed prices the last 6-8 months to just get this material out to people.
[00:37:08.837 --> 00:37:13.801]  And it's been exciting to see you responding to us cutting the prices down to where our profits are very small.
[00:37:14.202 --> 00:37:17.324]  So we need you to order a lot so we can keep going and keep operating here.
[00:37:19.086 --> 00:37:20.727]  We take the capital that comes in.
[00:37:20.767 --> 00:37:21.608]  We hire more people.
[00:37:21.628 --> 00:37:22.308]  We expand.
[00:37:22.348 --> 00:37:23.769]  We increase the info war.
[00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.812]  We are really fighting the New World Order toe-to-toe.
[00:37:27.492 --> 00:37:32.457]  You can also call toll-free to ask about the films and different specials and to order via the phone.
[00:37:32.477 --> 00:37:32.537]  1-888-253-3139
[00:37:38.191 --> 00:37:38.451]  888-253-3139.
[00:37:39.712 --> 00:37:48.978]  That's the same number you call if you want a ticket mailed out to you for the June 24th-25th Symposium, or if you want to order by credit card over the phone.
[00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:53.081]  We'll email you the e-ticket with your name and your e-ticket number.
[00:37:53.141 --> 00:37:56.944]  Then you just check in once on Saturday morning at, you know, 10 to 11.
[00:37:57.284 --> 00:37:59.746]  And then you've got a wristband for the duration of the event.
[00:38:00.874 --> 00:38:03.696]  We've got a big discount of, what is it, about 40%?
[00:38:04.097 --> 00:38:06.759]  Yeah, it's about 40% discount.
[00:38:06.779 --> 00:38:11.602]  I haven't done the math, but what's 74 versus 45?
[00:38:12.443 --> 00:38:16.166]  It's like 40% discount for students that we just put up there.
[00:38:16.886 --> 00:38:21.730]  We're sending out a mass email for people that have purchased from TheInfoWars.com shopping cart.
[00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.551]  You're getting a 10% discount.
[00:38:25.189 --> 00:38:26.129]  Now is the time.
[00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.050]  Don't wait.
[00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:27.870]  Get your tickets.
[00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:28.631]  They're going to sell out.
[00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:29.451]  It's exploding.
[00:38:29.691 --> 00:38:31.472]  We're selling the tickets quickly now.
[00:38:32.252 --> 00:38:35.754]  And so, I think we're going to sell out the thousand tickets that are available.
[00:38:35.894 --> 00:38:37.955]  So, do what is needed now.
[00:38:38.055 --> 00:38:38.655]  Get your tickets.
[00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:40.836]  I want to see you there June 24th, 25th.
[00:38:41.116 --> 00:38:42.837]  Again, Infowars.com to order or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:45.998]  And the cutoff to mail us an order and for us to mail you one back
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.462]  Is in about a week.
[00:38:51.522 --> 00:39:02.398]  You need to go ahead and if you want to write to us, instead of calling or going online, write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.022]  But, you know, you mail it to us.
[00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:06.544]  It might take seven days for us to get it.
[00:39:07.193 --> 00:39:11.697]  And then it'll take seven days or so, usually three days, but it might take as many as seven to get it back to you.
[00:39:11.998 --> 00:39:15.081]  So you need to get it to us next week so we can get you this ticket.
[00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:19.865]  And if you didn't and you showed up, you know, we'd figure it out and we'll have a listing in your name so you'll still get in.
[00:39:20.686 --> 00:39:22.308]  So, I'm done talking about that.
[00:39:22.968 --> 00:39:23.749]  Just take action.
[00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:24.990]  We're going to have Ray McGovern there.
[00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.932]  We're going to have CIA top advisor.
[00:39:26.952 --> 00:39:29.475]  We're going to have BYU physics professor Stephen Jones.
[00:39:30.103 --> 00:39:32.685]  We're going to have another professor, Jim Fetzer.
[00:39:33.066 --> 00:39:34.447]  We're going to have William Rodriguez.
[00:39:34.467 --> 00:39:35.648]  Just so many other people.
[00:39:35.688 --> 00:39:36.709]  A surprise guest.
[00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:38.590]  I'm sure you can guess who that guest will be.
[00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.612]  You'll hear about it three days before the event.
[00:39:41.173 --> 00:39:44.495]  You will hear the announcement here on air who that special guest will be.
[00:39:45.536 --> 00:39:49.480]  But they don't want it announced until very close for their own reasons, which will go unannounced.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.460]  Okay.
[00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:56.142]  Best way to talk about what's happened is to play this ABC News clip so we can analyze it.
[00:39:56.182 --> 00:39:58.404]  It's a pretty fair piece, but I want to comment and critique it.
[00:39:58.845 --> 00:40:06.431]  This ABC News piece from last night concerning this little girl who was one of the sole survivors of one of these confirmed massacres.
[00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:07.852]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:40:09.247 --> 00:40:16.208]  This is one of the houses Marines stormed in Haditha last November, allegedly killing virtually everybody inside.
[00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:22.190]  A whole family was wiped out, this man said in a video made the following day.
[00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.990]  The father, the mother, and three children.
[00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.571]  But there was one survivor, 12-year-old Safa Yonis.
[00:40:29.211 --> 00:40:34.092]  ABC News has obtained a short interview with Safa, done about a week after the killings.
[00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:40.520]  The Americans knocked at the door, Safa says.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.201]  My father went to open it.
[00:40:42.422 --> 00:40:47.206]  They shot him dead from behind the door and then they shot him again after they opened the door.
[00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:56.774]  Safa describes hearing the Marines go through the rest of the house shooting and setting off a grenade before getting to the bedroom where she was hiding with her mother and siblings.
[00:40:59.092 --> 00:41:02.155]  Then comes one American soldier and shot at us all.
[00:41:02.655 --> 00:41:06.999]  She said, I pretended to be dead and he did not know about me.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:14.566]  All this happened after a small Marine convoy was struck by a roadside bomb killing Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas.
[00:41:15.086 --> 00:41:18.389]  At first the Marines said the civilians were killed by the bomb too.
[00:41:18.929 --> 00:41:23.133]  Later they said the civilians were caught in the crossfire of a gunfight with insurgents.
[00:41:23.875 --> 00:41:29.481]  Now military investigators believe the only gunfire here came from the Marines themselves.
[00:41:30.061 --> 00:41:36.888]  Democratic Congressman John Murtha, a former Marine, was recently briefed on the investigation by the Commandant of the Marine Corps.
[00:41:37.368 --> 00:41:40.391]  But I will not excuse murder, and this is what happened.
[00:41:40.571 --> 00:41:42.072]  There's no question in my mind about it.
[00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:48.859]  This investigation should have been over two or three weeks afterwards, and it should have been made public, and people should have been held responsible for it.
[00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:54.862]  In fact, the military didn't launch a full investigation until this video was made available to Time Magazine.
[00:41:55.422 --> 00:42:02.904]  The human rights group in Iraq that released that video also released today's interview to ABC News, along with new pictures of the aftermath.
[00:42:03.344 --> 00:42:09.726]  Military investigators say bullet shells and other forensic evidence found in these homes came from the Marines' weapons.
[00:42:10.286 --> 00:42:18.048]  ABC News has learned that Sergeant Frank Wuterich, the highest-ranking member of the team that went into the homes, is a focus of the investigation.
[00:42:18.775 --> 00:42:26.098]  On this week, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner, said he'll hold hearings to investigate whether there was a cover-up.
[00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:35.403]  There is this serious question, however, of what happened, and when it happened, and what was the immediate reaction of the senior officers in the Marine Corps.
[00:42:37.103 --> 00:42:39.925]  So, there's the clip, and it's a pretty fair piece.
[00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:43.446]  Now, conversely, I have a Fox News clip, and I probably won't even play it.
[00:42:43.526 --> 00:42:44.607]  It's too unbelievable.
[00:42:45.498 --> 00:42:52.979]  Hannity's up there saying Murtha's a traitor, and that this is bad for morale, and basically saying none of this is a big deal.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:00.821]  I mean, we've got Warner, who's about as neocon old guard, New World Ordered as it gets, saying this is serious.
[00:43:02.021 --> 00:43:10.443]  Now, look, they were in a little town, a roadside bomb blows up one of the vehicles, kills somebody, wounds some others, and they go into a rage, and they go into the first house,
[00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:15.313]  And they killed, in that one frenzy, 23 people.
[00:43:15.373 --> 00:43:16.053]  That's confirmed.
[00:43:16.834 --> 00:43:18.454]  Then the Marines lied about it.
[00:43:18.494 --> 00:43:19.315]  Now, this is confirmed.
[00:43:19.935 --> 00:43:23.777]  They claim they were killed by the roadside bomb, and they claim they were killed in crossfire.
[00:43:24.417 --> 00:43:26.078]  And you see the video inside the house.
[00:43:26.198 --> 00:43:33.001]  It's children, it's women, with their heads blown off, and huge holes in the ground where the bullets were going through them and the grenade went off.
[00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:35.082]  And they went in that house and they killed everybody in there.
[00:43:36.343 --> 00:43:37.964]  Except for the young 12-year-old girl.
[00:43:38.584 --> 00:43:40.405]  Now, every time this happens,
[00:43:42.139 --> 00:43:49.004]  The week Abu Ghraib comes out, the British Army stages photos of themselves urinating on people.
[00:43:49.084 --> 00:43:50.124]  It turns out it was fake.
[00:43:50.144 --> 00:43:52.246]  But they admit the Army staged it and released it.
[00:43:52.586 --> 00:43:53.627]  The Army did!
[00:43:54.787 --> 00:43:58.210]  In Basra, the main sector of the British bivouac.
[00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.992]  It's a little fortress there in the south.
[00:44:03.733 --> 00:44:07.316]  Magically, we started hearing about this latest massacre three weeks ago.
[00:44:07.356 --> 00:44:08.236]  We were reporting on it.
[00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:09.717]  It was in foreign press.
[00:44:09.737 --> 00:44:10.918]  This video had already been out there.
[00:44:11.664 --> 00:44:22.913]  And then suddenly, this shoddy video comes out, and I should have known it was under Neocon, I fell for it for a day, a lot of people did, you know, saying, because I'd already heard about this stuff going on, and see, the propaganda's good.
[00:44:23.254 --> 00:44:29.479]  They really, and I guarantee you, you track down who this Macbeth character is, it's going to be a Neocon, because we've caught them before.
[00:44:30.439 --> 00:44:34.863]  And they say basically the exact same thing, but it's fake, from the North.
[00:44:36.084 --> 00:44:40.688]  So see, and Fox News is doing pieces saying, this stuff's all fake, just like this case, we bet this is fake.
[00:44:43.567 --> 00:44:45.549]  And we've seen this over and over again.
[00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:50.094]  Remember when the news came out of General Takumbo's own report where they pled guilty to raping women and children?
[00:44:50.935 --> 00:44:53.958]  Well, that gets on MSNBC and a few other places once or twice.
[00:44:53.998 --> 00:44:55.179]  Nobody ever really hears about it.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:01.306]  And then they take porno pictures off the web of military men having sex with women.
[00:45:02.387 --> 00:45:03.888]  And I looked at those and we caught that.
[00:45:03.948 --> 00:45:06.211]  I said, this is... this is porn!
[00:45:07.122 --> 00:45:09.863]  You know, these are women in the stance that they're enjoying it.
[00:45:10.223 --> 00:45:11.804]  These are Caucasian men.
[00:45:11.824 --> 00:45:13.064]  These are Caucasian women.
[00:45:14.385 --> 00:45:15.545]  Granted, they had dark hair.
[00:45:15.585 --> 00:45:17.886]  That was about as Eastern as they got.
[00:45:18.607 --> 00:45:20.247]  And it was fake!
[00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:24.929]  It was fake as a $3 bill, or fake as George Bush being a Texan is.
[00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:29.851]  It was as fake as the Federal Reserve is private.
[00:45:33.007 --> 00:45:35.912]  We called it as fake and then later two weeks later it came out as fake.
[00:45:36.273 --> 00:45:46.430]  And by the way, we caught the Boston Globe, took those pictures, brought them out, reported them as real, knowingly, the urination picture.
[00:45:47.598 --> 00:45:50.641]  And this is four days after it had been discredited and admitted.
[00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:55.426]  All over the news, they publish it on purpose, say it's real, just to have a fake retraction.
[00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:57.628]  I mean, a big front-page retraction, by the way.
[00:45:57.648 --> 00:45:59.269]  They didn't do back-of-the-paper retraction.
[00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.391]  These guys are slick, folks.
[00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:02.752]  They count on you being stupid.
[00:46:03.253 --> 00:46:03.733]  They really do.
[00:46:03.753 --> 00:46:04.934]  I'm going to go to some calls in a minute.
[00:46:04.954 --> 00:46:11.941]  Before I do that, I was listening to Neocons this morning, getting packed for Chicago.
[00:46:12.521 --> 00:46:13.122]  They're in the house.
[00:46:13.976 --> 00:46:17.621]  My children really don't watch TV, but we do let the talk radio be on in the background.
[00:46:19.824 --> 00:46:25.151]  And I'm there, getting ready, listening to a neocon, one of the better known ones.
[00:46:25.191 --> 00:46:26.533]  You know, it's a CNN TV show.
[00:46:28.095 --> 00:46:28.736]  And he's lying.
[00:46:29.156 --> 00:46:29.877]  He knows what he's doing.
[00:46:30.178 --> 00:46:30.699]  Same lie.
[00:46:30.739 --> 00:46:31.680]  It's as if they've got a script.
[00:46:32.634 --> 00:46:34.735]  What's wrong with the oil companies making money?
[00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:35.656]  Are you socialists?
[00:46:35.676 --> 00:46:36.816]  This is capitalism.
[00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:40.498]  They deserve the 7% they make domestically on profits.
[00:46:40.538 --> 00:46:42.559]  Are you against profits?
[00:46:42.819 --> 00:46:44.380]  70% of their profits are overseas.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.561]  You know, and they don't have very good PR.
[00:46:46.601 --> 00:46:48.482]  I mean, you don't want to give your money to the government, do you?
[00:46:49.823 --> 00:46:50.063]  Hey!
[00:46:50.223 --> 00:46:50.403]  Hey!
[00:46:51.081 --> 00:46:52.782]  They make more than seven percent.
[00:46:52.942 --> 00:46:53.743]  That's a Cook number.
[00:46:53.783 --> 00:46:56.205]  We've done old shows on this, written articles.
[00:46:56.525 --> 00:46:57.546]  And I'm for free market.
[00:46:58.006 --> 00:47:03.871]  If somebody invents a widget that can levitate cars and they make a trillion bucks, more power to them.
[00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:10.836]  But if they try to use federal regulators to go after somebody else who develops a floating car, then you've got a problem.
[00:47:11.196 --> 00:47:12.698]  I'm not for monopolies, Jack.
[00:47:13.438 --> 00:47:14.479]  And let me add more to that.
[00:47:15.982 --> 00:47:18.383]  He stated the lie that it's free market.
[00:47:18.683 --> 00:47:25.426]  We have the oil company documents from 95-96, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Dutch Rochelle, Texaco and others.
[00:47:27.046 --> 00:47:28.127]  We don't just claim that.
[00:47:28.267 --> 00:47:29.927]  It's official AP news.
[00:47:29.987 --> 00:47:31.848]  But again, never got on the nightly news.
[00:47:31.868 --> 00:47:33.789]  So the average person doesn't read news wires.
[00:47:35.849 --> 00:47:39.791]  Didn't read the big consumer advocate websites that sued to get these documents and lawsuits.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:52.733]  Then they say, there's 214 refineries, there's too much oil, we've discovered too much oil, there's too many other oil companies that are shipping it in, Saddam's overproducing, we've got to find a way to make bigger profits.
[00:47:52.773 --> 00:47:54.134]  What do we do worldwide?
[00:47:54.154 --> 00:47:54.515]  214 in the U.S.
[00:47:56.036 --> 00:48:05.622]  Worldwide will buy up private, independent refineries that are supplying at the time around 60% of the petrol, the gasoline, refined oil, and they did it.
[00:48:05.722 --> 00:48:11.766]  They bought up everyone in the US, almost everyone in Europe, and gas prices since then have conservatively more than doubled.
[00:48:12.587 --> 00:48:13.408]  Doubled and then some.
[00:48:13.868 --> 00:48:15.869]  We have the smoking gun!
[00:48:16.329 --> 00:48:21.813]  Then they blame the bug-eyed environmentalists who were actually funded by the fake environmentalists by the big oil companies.
[00:48:22.153 --> 00:48:22.774]  That's admitted.
[00:48:23.774 --> 00:48:24.655]  Most of the big groups are.
[00:48:25.379 --> 00:48:27.660]  They're there, and they believe they're stopping it!
[00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:35.825]  George Bush has got the House, he's got the Senate, he had both houses of the Congress five years ago when he had a 90% approval rating.
[00:48:36.265 --> 00:48:35.825]  95%!
[00:48:36.405 --> 00:48:38.307]  It was 94, excuse me.
[00:48:38.667 --> 00:48:41.789]  They could have had Arctic, they don't need to drill, they're all capped.
[00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:45.070]  It's just such a scam.
[00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:51.234]  And I've got to listen to these liars, conning these good conservative Americans, go, that's right!
[00:48:51.866 --> 00:48:53.306]  That's right, it's Food Market!
[00:48:53.747 --> 00:48:54.587]  No it isn't!
[00:48:54.867 --> 00:48:56.207]  You're being lied to!
[00:48:57.428 --> 00:48:57.948]  Oh, man.
[00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.149]  Taylor in Maryland, you're on the air.
[00:49:00.189 --> 00:49:00.849]  Welcome, Taylor.
[00:49:01.409 --> 00:49:02.269]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.230]  Well, that was an exciting call.
[00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:08.551]  I went to your call and you got disconnected, sir.
[00:49:09.272 --> 00:49:10.132]  Call back, Taylor.
[00:49:10.752 --> 00:49:11.792]  Alex in Connecticut.
[00:49:11.812 --> 00:49:12.633]  Go ahead, Alex.
[00:49:12.653 --> 00:49:13.253]  You're on the air.
[00:49:13.753 --> 00:49:14.193]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:14.633]  How are you doing?
[00:49:14.893 --> 00:49:15.073]  Good.
[00:49:15.173 --> 00:49:15.654]  I'm doing fine.
[00:49:15.934 --> 00:49:16.134]  Good.
[00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:16.454]  Cool.
[00:49:16.974 --> 00:49:19.355]  Hey, I just wanted to talk about
[00:49:20.868 --> 00:49:25.490]  That, uh, I ordered your Citizen Rule books and I was reading through them.
[00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.871]  Yeah, this is good.
[00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:29.051]  So I'm going to pass it out to friends and stuff.
[00:49:29.492 --> 00:49:29.772]  Great!
[00:49:29.932 --> 00:49:31.392]  Um, that gets you going, man.
[00:49:32.013 --> 00:49:33.873]  I'm glad you got that for us.
[00:49:34.774 --> 00:49:36.355]  Um, so I'm going to do that.
[00:49:36.515 --> 00:49:45.858]  And I just want to tell everybody, hey, yeah, um, I've been airing films in my town and you know, people, they get reactions, either negative or positive.
[00:49:45.878 --> 00:49:47.039]  So keep doing it.
[00:49:48.455 --> 00:49:50.757]  How are you airing documentaries in your area?
[00:49:51.878 --> 00:49:58.362]  I just go to the Town Access and they make copies and they submit them.
[00:49:58.822 --> 00:49:59.783]  And voila!
[00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:05.066]  Thousands of people get to see the truth just because you took action, because you cared.
[00:50:05.667 --> 00:50:11.651]  Yeah, and Public Access and I got the written consent form, like you told me, I did what I had to do, and they're airing.
[00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:15.213]  And yes, I showed one of the TexMars
[00:50:15.974 --> 00:50:27.178]  uh... videos and wow a lot of people got very excited about and angry uh... mayors take that down because I don't know maybe I'm exposing something they don't want me to expose.
[00:50:27.198 --> 00:50:28.078]  Did they take it down?
[00:50:28.498 --> 00:50:33.660]  No, because I wasn't within the guidelines so the guy at channel 14.
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.781]  What films have you aired?
[00:50:35.681 --> 00:50:44.604]  uh... Martial Law I just finished airing your America Destroyed by Design I aired 9-11 Rose of Tyranny I'm going to air Dark Secrets this month
[00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:53.870]  I just had an idea.
[00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:58.175]  Anybody that faxes me proof they're an Access producer, I'll send you films for free.
[00:50:58.996 --> 00:51:00.037]  I won't put you on hold.
[00:51:00.077 --> 00:51:00.398]  Stay there.
[00:51:01.676 --> 00:51:09.924]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:10.124 --> 00:51:12.467]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[00:51:13.067 --> 00:51:21.916]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:51:22.416 --> 00:51:25.937]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:51:26.377 --> 00:51:47.184]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charplin, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:51.245]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:51:51.705 --> 00:51:52.946]  Arm yourself with the truth!
[00:51:53.306 --> 00:52:01.148]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.629 --> 00:52:09.151]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:20.335]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:22.396]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.676 --> 00:52:25.977]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.317 --> 00:52:27.657]  But it's worth every penny.
[00:52:27.797 --> 00:52:36.760]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:37.580]  That's right!
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:44.862]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:49.284]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:49.444 --> 00:52:53.905]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.925 --> 00:52:54.405]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.542 --> 00:53:03.863]  I think so.
[00:53:18.766 --> 00:53:19.427]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.286 --> 00:53:51.387]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.547 --> 00:53:57.549]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:07.492]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.152 --> 00:54:10.492]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:12.073 --> 00:54:14.393]  Bill, Taylor, Jim, Don, all of you are going to get your calls.
[00:54:14.413 --> 00:54:16.014]  We've got a general coming up in about 10 minutes.
[00:54:17.014 --> 00:54:18.495]  Talk about some very interesting stuff.
[00:54:18.875 --> 00:54:20.876]  Right now, let's talk to Bill in Maryland.
[00:54:20.896 --> 00:54:21.757]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:54:21.817 --> 00:54:22.137]  Welcome.
[00:54:23.257 --> 00:54:24.498]  They disconnected Taylor.
[00:54:24.518 --> 00:54:26.219]  I guess they got the wrong person in Maryland.
[00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:27.980]  Okay, we're going to go to you.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.581]  We're talking to you right now, Bill.
[00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:35.644]  Okay, I'm going to briefly go over some technological aspects of these cards for your listeners, if that's okay with you.
[00:54:35.904 --> 00:54:36.745]  These cards?
[00:54:36.865 --> 00:54:37.185]  Yeah.
[00:54:37.585 --> 00:54:38.866]  What about the ID cards?
[00:54:38.966 --> 00:54:40.086]  Yeah, there's two different kinds.
[00:54:40.367 --> 00:54:41.887]  You have the ISO 7816 smart cards.
[00:54:43.985 --> 00:54:47.006]  And what that is, is a card with a little gold contact on it.
[00:54:47.106 --> 00:54:49.146]  And that has to be physically read by a computer.
[00:54:49.546 --> 00:54:51.767]  Then you have RFID that are passive.
[00:54:51.787 --> 00:54:51.887]  Right.
[00:54:52.067 --> 00:54:53.507]  And those are called proxy chips.
[00:54:53.767 --> 00:54:59.548]  And the proxy IDs, when I worked for the Census in 2000, it was a subcontracted job.
[00:54:59.908 --> 00:55:00.888]  I didn't work for the government.
[00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:04.229]  But you have to hold these up to the turnstiles.
[00:55:04.289 --> 00:55:09.950]  And the General can probably verify for this later, because I applied for a job at NSA and I saw them there.
[00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.651]  And it just broadcasts a serial number on the proxy cards.
[00:55:14.523 --> 00:55:16.485]  And there's a coil.
[00:55:17.466 --> 00:55:22.451]  It's similar to the technology that they're going to have in the implantable chips that they're using.
[00:55:22.571 --> 00:55:24.192]  It's radio frequency identification.
[00:55:24.292 --> 00:55:24.533]  Right.
[00:55:25.053 --> 00:55:31.279]  There's a magnetic field and that charges a wire and that charges a capacitor and that broadcasts a serial number.
[00:55:31.299 --> 00:55:32.300]  That's all it does.
[00:55:33.021 --> 00:55:34.362]  But then that goes to a database.
[00:55:35.396 --> 00:55:35.616]  Yeah.
[00:55:35.796 --> 00:55:37.076]  That's the point.
[00:55:37.837 --> 00:55:41.938]  It's a Nexus entrance port to the entire system.
[00:55:42.138 --> 00:55:42.678]  That's correct.
[00:55:42.698 --> 00:55:47.559]  The database has to be there to pull up the information, because it doesn't have any of your information in the chip.
[00:55:47.579 --> 00:55:48.719]  It just has serial numbers.
[00:55:49.699 --> 00:55:55.141]  Now, the smart cards, I think they can only hold about 128K of information.
[00:55:55.161 --> 00:56:01.842]  It's just a small amount of information, but they can put your name on there, kind of like the magnetic stripes on the charge cards.
[00:56:02.342 --> 00:56:04.943]  And that's the one that's going to be used in the biometric
[00:56:05.803 --> 00:56:06.943]  A system that you talk about.
[00:56:06.983 --> 00:56:08.864]  If you go online, you can find all this equipment.
[00:56:08.964 --> 00:56:12.504]  ISO stands for International Standards Organization.
[00:56:12.544 --> 00:56:14.865]  And that allows any person or company... That's right.
[00:56:14.885 --> 00:56:16.565]  The UN made a deal six years ago.
[00:56:16.605 --> 00:56:19.045]  This is really a global ID system.
[00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:19.325]  Right.
[00:56:19.485 --> 00:56:21.126]  ISO is part of a global system.
[00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:29.147]  But what ISO does is for any technical aspect that you want to do, allows you to create a CD or DVD or any kind of digital information.
[00:56:29.707 --> 00:56:34.408]  But not only can a big company can do this, but just an individual can create this stuff.
[00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:38.333]  It's an international standards system.
[00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:38.715]  Yeah.
[00:56:39.654 --> 00:56:40.034]  I hear you.
[00:56:40.074 --> 00:56:40.695]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:40.715 --> 00:56:41.535]  Interesting info.
[00:56:41.975 --> 00:56:44.036]  Now let's talk to Taylor in Maryland, and they're back.
[00:56:44.076 --> 00:56:44.797]  Taylor, go ahead.
[00:56:45.097 --> 00:56:45.617]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:45.677 --> 00:56:46.357]  Sorry about that.
[00:56:46.377 --> 00:56:46.658]  That's okay.
[00:56:46.678 --> 00:56:47.018]  Go ahead.
[00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:53.581]  Have you heard anything about the Supreme Court voting to restrict free speech for federal employees?
[00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:55.562]  Yeah, I talked about that about 30 minutes ago.
[00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:57.503]  Court rules no whistleblower free speech.
[00:56:57.523 --> 00:56:58.944]  Reuters, a closely divided U.S.
[00:56:58.964 --> 00:57:06.908]  Supreme Court, ruled on Tuesday that government whistleblowers are not protected by free speech rights when they face employer discipline for trying to expose possible misconduct at work.
[00:57:07.268 --> 00:57:07.388]  Wow!
[00:57:07.408 --> 00:57:08.969]  Well, if our people don't wake up with that one,
[00:57:36.778 --> 00:57:37.519]  I don't know what to say.
[00:57:37.559 --> 00:57:42.502]  If criminals ran things, they'd make it where you couldn't report them, and that's what we got running things.
[00:57:43.263 --> 00:57:43.863]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:57:44.423 --> 00:57:45.864]  Thank you, I appreciate the call.
[00:57:45.904 --> 00:57:46.905]  Let's jam another in.
[00:57:46.965 --> 00:57:48.746]  Don in Ohio, welcome.
[00:57:50.268 --> 00:57:54.571]  Yeah, I'd like to bring up the subject of public access channels on PBS.
[00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:58.773]  Now, we used to have a public access channel that did do a little bit on
[00:57:59.972 --> 00:58:00.973]  The New World Order.
[00:58:10.055 --> 00:58:16.936]  Um, since they were showing that stuff, you know, they were showing stuff of yours, and, uh, you know, I think somebody got a little bit, uh, you know, frustrated with it.
[00:58:16.956 --> 00:58:21.357]  They restricted it and made it just government, uh, uh, announcements and PR reports.
[00:58:21.577 --> 00:58:32.380]  No, actually, what they did was, they started showing porn at night, and they let everybody get upset about it, and then they turned it into just an all- Oh, we've seen them, they did that in Houston, you know, they did that on purpose.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.440]  Tell you what, stay there, I'll let you, I'll let you finish up, we, we gotta break.
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:37.641]  Time waits for no man, or woman.
[00:58:37.861 --> 00:58:38.921]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:58:41.488 --> 00:58:46.369]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.449 --> 00:58:46.830]  Hello.
[00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:47.350]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:48.250]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.231]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:50.971]  You want answers?
[00:58:51.891 --> 00:58:54.792]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.902 --> 00:59:09.885]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.086 --> 00:59:14.209]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.429 --> 00:59:25.919]  Now in to hour number two on this live Thursday, June 1st, 2006 edition,
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:36.105]  Our big 9-11 conference is coming up in just 23 days, the 24th and 25th of June in Los Angeles.
[00:59:36.125 --> 00:59:38.127]  Get your tickets now at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:38.407 --> 00:59:43.271]  They're going quicker by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:59:43.311 --> 00:59:49.297]  Learn all the details, the great speakers and more, and the films that will be screened there at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:53.915]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to a call.
[00:59:53.935 --> 00:59:57.877]  We've got a general coming up to criticize the direction our government's going in here in a few minutes.
[00:59:58.297 --> 01:00:05.781]  But right now, let's go ahead and let Don in Ohio finish up, and we'll go to Jim and Todd and others.
[01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:08.342]  Don, you were talking about how they try to shut AXS TV down.
[01:00:08.362 --> 01:00:25.348]  They either put bulletin board up or air nothing but government propaganda or we've caught people nationwide on purpose airing porn late at night when no one knows to then cause a big furor and shut it down or some idiot does that or something risqué even that's even on mainstream TV and they call it porn and they shut it down.
[01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:25.768]  Go ahead.
[01:00:26.328 --> 01:00:28.289]  Well, the second point was about PBS.
[01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:33.931]  Do you think we have a chance if we'd pull together and start trying to take the
[01:00:35.127 --> 01:00:39.309]  PBS away from the neocons that Bush and company put into power?
[01:00:39.529 --> 01:00:43.091]  Well, I mean, it's openly, it's always been founded by the Rockefellers and others.
[01:00:43.151 --> 01:00:46.112]  It's always run by big foundations and they act like it's progressive.
[01:00:46.132 --> 01:00:46.673]  It's really not.
[01:00:46.693 --> 01:00:49.094]  I mean, you can forget public radio and TV.
[01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:55.477]  I mean, there are a few little co-ops that are private public radio stations around the country, but I mean, most of it's horrible.
[01:00:56.017 --> 01:00:56.998]  Okay.
[01:00:57.038 --> 01:00:57.398]  Thank you much.
[01:00:57.778 --> 01:00:58.719]  Thank you for your call.
[01:00:58.839 --> 01:01:00.860]  Let's talk now to Jim in Wisconsin.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.540]  Jim, go ahead.
[01:01:02.136 --> 01:01:06.718]  Hey Alex, have you ever talked about the National Animal Identification System?
[01:01:07.438 --> 01:01:08.919]  We've talked about it ad nauseum.
[01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:10.239]  It was funded last week.
[01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:16.861]  And it'll be $2,000 a day fines if one of your chickens or even your private bird or dog isn't chipped.
[01:01:17.362 --> 01:01:21.083]  And it's federal regulators at the local level making the IRS look like nothing.
[01:01:21.103 --> 01:01:27.265]  And it was written by big agriculture companies openly to force all their competition out of business.
[01:01:27.565 --> 01:01:28.986]  But we're beating it at the state levels.
[01:01:29.526 --> 01:01:35.989]  I noticed that the representative from Wisconsin that you had on earlier conveniently neglected to mention that all together.
[01:01:36.269 --> 01:01:41.752]  And it directly relates to chipping of people because that's the ultimate goal of the whole program.
[01:01:42.092 --> 01:01:46.034]  Well, I mean, is Representative Marlon Schneider, is he for it?
[01:01:46.594 --> 01:01:46.954]  I don't know.
[01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:48.335]  I've never heard of him before today.
[01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:54.118]  We had him on, for those that don't know, because they just passed along Wisconsin barring forest and planet chips and humans.
[01:01:55.979 --> 01:02:01.360]  And he was praising, uh, Feingold, actually, and Feingold is for the animal identification thing.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.000]  Well, that's not good, but he did say he was for the Second Amendment.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:04.680]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.941 --> 01:02:13.902]  Well, they're pioneering it here in the state, and, uh, they've already... Well, he admitted Enhanced 9-1-1 is already in, folks, and they're tracking everything you do, listening to you.
[01:02:13.922 --> 01:02:15.102]  The cops can hit one button.
[01:02:15.382 --> 01:02:23.504]  Most cops don't know there's shit because it hasn't been put in in the squad car level yet, but the emergency management centers can dial in, follow everything you're doing, dial in and listen to you.
[01:02:23.744 --> 01:02:24.604]  They do it all the time.
[01:02:24.644 --> 01:02:25.204]  How's that freedom?
[01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:39.533]  Oh, well, I mean, they've already got the premises identification thing going on, where if you own or cohabitate or house any livestock, you have to have your premises registered in this new database.
[01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:48.127]  I know, and monthly inspections and new taxes and it makes the veterinarians and insured servants who have to go out and enforce this for free.
[01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:53.449]  I hear you, the Animal ID Act, the Primus Society Act, now funded congressionally.
[01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:56.671]  Texas has passed the worst law accompanying it.
[01:02:57.011 --> 01:03:00.712]  We're beating that legislation right now here trying to get it repealed.
[01:03:01.413 --> 01:03:08.256]  Well, I'd like to maybe get some more information on what you've been doing because there's not much of a movement here in Wisconsin to fight this.
[01:03:09.088 --> 01:03:14.330]  As far as I can tell, I mean, there's no NAIS.org, which is a good site.
[01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:18.451]  But, you know, we don't have any effective opposition at this point.
[01:03:19.971 --> 01:03:25.913]  Well, we've been rallying and going to these meetings here in Texas, and it's in trouble in a lot of areas at the state level.
[01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:30.074]  I mean, you weren't aware I've done about ten shows on it lately.
[01:03:30.434 --> 01:03:33.175]  You may not have been listening, so you may not be aware of some other stuff going on.
[01:03:33.515 --> 01:03:34.775]  But thank you for being involved, sir.
[01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:36.416]  You're out there, you're involved, so keep it up!
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.762]  I know things are dark, though.
[01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:45.113]  There's a lot of bad things that are happening, but together we can get our Constitution and Bill of Rights back.
[01:03:46.014 --> 01:03:51.143]  Speaking of being right back, we're going to come back and we'll be talking to a two-star general.
[01:03:53.658 --> 01:04:01.905]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:04.447]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:04:05.047 --> 01:04:13.895]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:17.917]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:39.166]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fesser, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:04:39.486 --> 01:04:43.208]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:55.673]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:55.793 --> 01:04:59.934]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:02.935]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.995 --> 01:05:09.658]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.878 --> 01:05:12.883]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:13.103 --> 01:05:15.487]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:15.647 --> 01:05:25.782]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:05:25.982 --> 01:05:35.087]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:35.247 --> 01:05:43.011]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:54.989 --> 01:05:57.570]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.891]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:06:00.172 --> 01:06:10.257]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:10.577 --> 01:06:12.898]  Let me tell you something about the Calbin Pure Soap Company.

[01:06:53.356 --> 01:06:58.399]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.759 --> 01:07:01.100]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.182 --> 01:07:05.183]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[01:07:06.445 --> 01:07:13.510]  Our military, our government is constituted to defend our liberties, to defend the republic against enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:07:14.691 --> 01:07:18.233]  It doesn't matter what administration has been in in recent years.
[01:07:18.854 --> 01:07:22.216]  Private corporations, international corporations have bought off our sovereignty.
[01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:26.199]  Bush's amnesty plan is just that, total amnesty.
[01:07:26.219 --> 01:07:29.501]  That's the words of not just Alex Jones, but people like Lou Dobbs.
[01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:30.602]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:36.313]  So many things are happening, and the good news is Americans are beginning to awaken.
[01:07:36.574 --> 01:07:42.039]  It takes Americans a while to wake up, but once we do, you better look out.
[01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:52.030]  And somebody's been awake for a long time, and who's been speaking out when Bill Clinton was in office against the police state and so many other issues, and taking God out of our government and out of our schools.
[01:07:53.297 --> 01:07:56.158]  He is Major General Carl D. Black, U.S.
[01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.859]  Air Force, retired.
[01:07:58.319 --> 01:08:07.863]  He was, as a leader, he served as Wing Commander, Vice Wing Commander, Wing Operations Group, and Group Commander, serving in Europe and the Pacific, as well as continental United States.
[01:08:07.923 --> 01:08:12.005]  And he's flown all different sorts of aircraft, fighter bombers, fighters, you name it.
[01:08:13.285 --> 01:08:16.206]  And his bio is extremely long.
[01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:19.848]  I'll let you hear from him what he thinks is important for you to know.
[01:08:20.558 --> 01:08:24.001]  The reason we have him on with us today is, obviously we couldn't have him on Monday.
[01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:24.822]  He was giving a speech.
[01:08:24.862 --> 01:08:25.823]  It was Memorial Day.
[01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:32.308]  I learned about him on Tuesday with this Courier-Journal article out of Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.070]  It's up on the websites right now.
[01:08:35.171 --> 01:08:41.957]  Freedom Under Siege, Retired General says, and it says a bullet ceremony honors veterans.
[01:08:42.237 --> 01:08:45.300]  And he went on to talk about how we're losing our freedoms here at home.
[01:08:46.181 --> 01:08:49.344]  Quite a few quotes there, but I figured there was even more to the story, and we talked to him.
[01:08:50.244 --> 01:08:52.206]  One of my producers, Kevin, did, and there certainly was.
[01:08:53.542 --> 01:09:00.188]  And of course he's won distinguished awards for some of his speeches on the issues of liberty, and I hope he'll repeat some of that here today.
[01:09:00.909 --> 01:09:02.330]  General, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.152]  Well, it's a pleasure to be on with you.
[01:09:04.412 --> 01:09:04.732]  You bet.
[01:09:04.772 --> 01:09:13.400]  For those that don't know, tell us a little bit about you and your history, your awakening to what's happening, and your stance on the State of the Republic.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.783]  And then let's get into the speech that you gave that got written up in the newspaper.
[01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:27.991]  Well, you know, I was involved with the Air Force in various capacities for about 33 years, and I don't consider myself anything more than just a patriot, you know?
[01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:29.272]  I really don't.
[01:09:30.553 --> 01:09:38.320]  But you see all these things that are happening, and you see the country apparently moving in the wrong direction.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.263]  I think we've got our eye on the wrong ball right now.
[01:09:43.635 --> 01:09:45.657]  We need to go back to the basics.
[01:09:45.817 --> 01:09:47.658]  We need to go back and look at our history.
[01:09:48.099 --> 01:09:52.222]  The history, which is, of course, trying to be rewritten as quickly as they can do it.
[01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:58.668]  And so, when our young people come along, they'll have no idea what we were all about to even begin with.
[01:09:58.748 --> 01:10:02.030]  So, if you don't know where you came from, how can you know where you're going?
[01:10:03.252 --> 01:10:07.655]  There's a good country song about, you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[01:10:08.136 --> 01:10:10.638]  Well, that's exactly right, and unfortunately,
[01:10:11.988 --> 01:10:17.069]  And if you don't know what you stand for, then you can be persuaded to do most anything.
[01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.810]  I agree.
[01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:22.111]  You talk about a lot of issues in some of the speeches and some of the things you've written.
[01:10:22.871 --> 01:10:33.113]  Again, tell us just a little bit about yourself, your history in the Air Force, some of the things you did in the Air Force, some of the tours of duty you served, and then let's get into the speech you gave and the things that you think are important.
[01:10:33.954 --> 01:10:38.515]  Well, I've been a pilot, I was an operator, and I was on flying status my whole career.
[01:10:38.555 --> 01:10:39.735]  Flew airplanes my life.
[01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.911]  The last airplane I flew was F-4s, RF-4s.
[01:10:43.591 --> 01:10:56.336]  And so, actually, my career is not anything exciting or anything to shout about, but I worked my way up through the ranks and worked my way up through the various positions.
[01:10:56.416 --> 01:11:08.040]  Again, served as a group commander and then as a vice wing commander and wing commander and then served at the major command level.
[01:11:08.783 --> 01:11:11.605]  And I got a chance to see a little of all of it.
[01:11:12.386 --> 01:11:20.893]  I was on active duty, was in the Reserve for a while, in the Guard for a while, finished my tour back with the active duty forces.
[01:11:21.713 --> 01:11:25.516]  And so, you know, I've had a good look at it, as have many others.
[01:11:25.856 --> 01:11:31.761]  Many others probably have more experience than I do, and they may see things even differently from what I see them.
[01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:37.886]  But what I see is that initially in the military,
[01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:40.274]  We were organized.
[01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:42.334]  It was pretty much black and white.
[01:11:43.555 --> 01:11:51.197]  As time progressed, I saw it become larger shades of gray, less of black and white.
[01:11:52.018 --> 01:11:57.279]  And since I've retired, it appears to even have increased in that direction.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.600]  And it's very concerning.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:05.102]  You know, it just doesn't have to be that way, but this political correctness, you know,
[01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:12.588]  This kind of started it all, as far as I'm concerned, and then this diversity thing.
[01:12:13.369 --> 01:12:14.750]  Certainly, we're all diverse.
[01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:22.776]  We all came from immigrants, but they were legal immigrants.
[01:12:23.596 --> 01:12:33.664]  Once we became citizens here, we found a common ground for which this diversity could be brought together to support a country called the United States.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:44.467]  Today, we have all these illegals here, and we don't know who they are, we don't know where they are, and they don't want to be Americans at all.
[01:12:45.188 --> 01:12:46.389]  They want to be whatever they are.
[01:12:46.409 --> 01:12:53.794]  They want to live here, and they like our country, and they want to suck up the milk and honey, but they don't want to be Americans.
[01:12:57.922 --> 01:13:06.207]  Theodore Roosevelt had quite a bit to say about that in 1907, which I think makes it all very clear, but I may be digressing over here a little bit.
[01:13:06.568 --> 01:13:07.588]  No, no, go ahead, General.
[01:13:07.728 --> 01:13:11.291]  Well, anyway, that's kind of where we are.
[01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:21.877]  You know, when the guys gathered up at Massachusetts at Concord on April 1775, they had had enough and they thought it was time to
[01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:25.395]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:13:53.957 --> 01:14:02.322]  Basically controlled by what those men did and when you actually read about the founding fathers and the incredible things they did and how we almost totally forsaken
[01:14:03.428 --> 01:14:14.395]  Their vision, what they gave us, I mean, dragging by hand, giant cannons from Ticonderoga, a hundred miles, and literally with their shoes worn through, leaving a trail of blood.
[01:14:14.796 --> 01:14:16.497]  That's not propaganda, that really happened.
[01:14:17.137 --> 01:14:28.605]  Going across the river into Trenton, when it was zero degrees, and people dying on the way, it was so cold, and then attacking the Germans, and just battle after battle, fighting six, eight times their numbers,
[01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:30.686]  I don't think they could find words to express it, you know?
[01:14:30.746 --> 01:14:35.690]  And what they gave us is a government for 230 years and there's never been another government that I know of that has lasted for 230 years.
[01:14:55.051 --> 01:15:01.056]  So, you know, they have given us everything, and yet we're tossing it away, you know?
[01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.218]  Well, let's jump right into the middle of it.
[01:15:03.238 --> 01:15:04.439]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:15.769]  I don't know if you've seen the video, but they sent in Army and some Marines, led by FBI, into the even wealthy areas that were high-end drive New Orleans and confiscated guns.
[01:15:16.069 --> 01:15:21.654]  And now the NRA is having to try to pass legislation to quote, don't confiscate guns during emergencies.
[01:15:21.954 --> 01:15:22.715]  What did you think of that?
[01:15:24.221 --> 01:15:29.591]  Well, I'm not that familiar with it, but I don't know what to think about a lot of things.
[01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:30.092]  I really don't.
[01:15:36.278 --> 01:15:39.700]  It's just unbelievable some of the things that are transpiring.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:40.860]  What are some of those things?
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.722]  Let's list a few of those and we'll go through them in detail.
[01:15:44.002 --> 01:15:45.303]  You mentioned the border first.
[01:15:45.343 --> 01:15:46.483]  Twenty-five million illegals.
[01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:47.764]  That's the real number.
[01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:51.185]  This guest worker program is total amnesty.
[01:15:51.566 --> 01:15:54.207]  We won't need troops on the border because they'll all be legal.
[01:15:54.587 --> 01:15:55.047]  That's right.
[01:15:55.808 --> 01:15:56.308]  That's right.
[01:15:56.668 --> 01:15:59.890]  But what I've never been able to figure out is why?
[01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:01.891]  Why don't we want to protect our borders?
[01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:03.571]  You know, of course,
[01:16:05.154 --> 01:16:17.244]  Well, I doubt that even the White House, well it's probably protected, but you probably can go to the Pentagon and, you know, I don't know how well even protected the Pentagon is anymore.
[01:16:17.324 --> 01:16:23.809]  You know, it's just flabbergasting some of the things that have happened in the last few years.
[01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:26.992]  What are a few of those issues you want to discuss?
[01:16:27.032 --> 01:16:29.874]  What are a few of the things that you talk about in your speech?
[01:16:30.074 --> 01:16:32.076]  Sovereignty being lost, the borders open.
[01:16:32.356 --> 01:16:33.477]  What are some of the other issues?
[01:16:34.369 --> 01:16:41.375]  Well, uh, I don't specifically, uh, I don't know.
[01:16:41.395 --> 01:16:58.609]  It just, it seems like that, that, that, that everything today, you know, the military is established on a command structure, you know, but it seems like today everything is done, you know, by committee or by vote.
[01:16:59.241 --> 01:17:17.458]  And management is not command, but we seem to have gotten these confused anymore, and we try to manage the military instead of run it by commanders who have the authority and the responsibility to take the action that's necessary to protect this country.
[01:17:18.199 --> 01:17:24.245]  And of course, the military is controlled, you know, by the civilians as it should be, you know, but then
[01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:33.932]  When you go to fight the war, the war should be turned over to the military commander and him given full sway to, you know, depress the war as they see fit.
[01:17:33.952 --> 01:17:40.234]  Well, General, I know you haven't even been out of the military long and it's hard for you to, you know, get into things and criticize because you're, you know, obviously trained not to do that.
[01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:48.596]  But, I mean, all the generals told Rumsfeld you need 450,000 troops and everyone that then would complain would get removed.
[01:17:48.896 --> 01:17:51.037]  An average stint was under four months.
[01:17:52.464 --> 01:17:54.665]  Do you want to comment on that?
[01:17:55.985 --> 01:18:01.346]  Well, you see, there again, they've got an answer for it.
[01:18:02.327 --> 01:18:05.967]  And I don't know how many it takes, really.
[01:18:07.828 --> 01:18:13.389]  They seem to have enough to win, that is, to conquer, but they didn't have enough to control.
[01:18:13.409 --> 01:18:18.210]  And that seems to be the hurting point right there.
[01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:20.591]  They can't control what we've got.
[01:18:22.034 --> 01:18:22.615]  Well, I agree.
[01:18:22.635 --> 01:18:25.717]  But in guerrilla warfare, if you can't hold it, you never got it to begin with.
[01:18:25.857 --> 01:18:26.458]  Well, that's true.
[01:18:26.678 --> 01:18:27.138]  That's true.
[01:18:27.298 --> 01:18:27.458]  Yeah.
[01:18:27.719 --> 01:18:32.583]  They're in a bunch of armored citadels, ducking at its... It's a shooting gallery.
[01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:33.603]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.105]  Let's get into the border issue, General.
[01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:43.511]  I want to get your take on that, and what you think some solutions ought to be, and we'll talk about why the Democrats and the Republicans want total amnesty.
[01:18:43.531 --> 01:18:45.813]  Of course, Lou Dobbs got the documents on it.
[01:18:45.873 --> 01:18:50.377]  It's about an American Union, which they don't want the people to know about, but that's what it is.
[01:18:54.119 --> 01:19:04.843]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:19:05.043 --> 01:19:12.606]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:12.886 --> 01:19:16.007]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:19:16.267 --> 01:19:22.034]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:19:22.315 --> 01:19:28.462]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:19:28.823 --> 01:19:32.727]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.650]  The water level is always visible.
[01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:40.773]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:44.955]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:44.975 --> 01:19:45.696]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[01:19:55.894 --> 01:19:56.935]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.336 --> 01:20:02.841]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:03.402 --> 01:20:03.902]  That's right.
[01:20:04.202 --> 01:20:06.505]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.065 --> 01:20:13.992]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.531 --> 01:20:22.240]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.681 --> 01:20:27.487]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:28.158 --> 01:20:33.163]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.964 --> 01:20:38.108]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.489 --> 01:20:38.729]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.769 --> 01:20:40.671]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:41.051]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.352 --> 01:20:41.612]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.005 --> 01:20:59.953]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:21:08.612 --> 01:21:09.012]  I think so.
[01:21:31.783 --> 01:21:32.744]  The Nationalist Times.
[01:21:32.924 --> 01:21:34.386]  Just $19 for one year.
[01:21:34.526 --> 01:21:36.208]  That's 50% off the regular price.
[01:21:36.428 --> 01:21:39.712]  Send your $19 subscription to The Nationalist Times, P.O.
[01:21:39.752 --> 01:21:42.895]  Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[01:21:43.216 --> 01:21:44.958]  That's The Nationalist Times, P.O.
[01:21:45.018 --> 01:21:46.800]  Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.

[01:21:53.849 --> 01:21:59.833]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:22:00.253 --> 01:22:02.915]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:03.075 --> 01:22:07.698]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:22:07.858 --> 01:22:12.682]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:22:12.862 --> 01:22:17.585]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:22:17.805 --> 01:22:20.487]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:23.609]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:22:24.889 --> 01:22:25.910]  Looking for profits?
[01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:27.350]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:30.891]  The $10 Olympic Commemorative Gold Coin offers both.
[01:22:30.951 --> 01:22:38.253]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:22:38.573 --> 01:22:42.113]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:43.854]  Secure your position today.
[01:22:44.154 --> 01:22:45.294]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.414 --> 01:22:45.654]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.713 --> 01:23:03.775]  Major General Carl D. Black, U.S.
[01:23:03.835 --> 01:23:04.855]  Air Force, retired.
[01:23:06.156 --> 01:23:09.639]  Headline of the Courier Journal, Freedom's Under Siege.
[01:23:09.679 --> 01:23:12.141]  Retired General says he goes over reasons why.
[01:23:13.282 --> 01:23:16.224]  Well, we know officially with the open borders it's about an American Union.
[01:23:16.304 --> 01:23:16.944]  That's admitted.
[01:23:18.065 --> 01:23:19.146]  So it is the end of this country.
[01:23:19.784 --> 01:23:21.084]  And even Lou Dobbs has reported that.
[01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:24.665]  It's important to note that even CNN is now reporting that.
[01:23:25.185 --> 01:23:39.548]  Going back to the General, General, we're going to now, we talked during the break, get into the border, get into what it takes to keep a republic free, but you were talking about the different stages of bondage to freedom.
[01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.088]  Why don't you go over that, sir?
[01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:47.550]  Okay, well, you know, the average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years.
[01:23:48.689 --> 01:23:53.592]  And of course, we're 230, so we're, you know, we're living on borrowed time, so to speak.
[01:23:53.992 --> 01:23:57.654]  And the nations have always progressed through a following sequence.
[01:23:58.374 --> 01:24:17.545]  And that sequence went from initial bondage into spiritual faith, and then from spiritual faith to great courage, courage to liberty, and from liberty to abundance, abundance then to apathy, and then apathy to dependence, and then dependence back into bondage.
[01:24:18.459 --> 01:24:22.680]  And Professor Olson up at Hanlon University School of Law in St.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:37.783]  Paul, Minnesota said he believes that America today is somewhere between apathy and dependence in that phase because there are 40% of the nation's population already having reached the governmental dependence phase.
[01:24:38.743 --> 01:24:47.425]  So you see, a democracy, they say that a democracy cannot exist because
[01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:59.620]  Once the citizens learn that they can vote themselves, you know, great packages of finances, etc., etc., we will do that.
[01:25:00.621 --> 01:25:11.549]  And this will finally end up, and I'm cutting to the chase here, it'll finally end up in that we'll have a very loose fiscal policy, and then the country will collapse.
[01:25:11.789 --> 01:25:14.631]  Well, there's no doubt that our corruption has accelerated.
[01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.773]  That's why we're a constitutional republic, as you know.
[01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:35.206]  With that rule of law to guard against the 51% voting to barbecue the other 49% or the old saying that Benjamin Franklin had, democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner and so the Republic is there to hold back that limited democracy from
[01:25:36.249 --> 01:25:36.409]  I agree.
[01:25:36.449 --> 01:25:36.629]  I agree.
[01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:39.170]  And then we're back in which the bondage leads ultimately to dictatorship, you know?
[01:26:05.842 --> 01:26:13.044]  Well, I see the government coddling the 25 million illegal aliens, many of which say this is Mexico and say they hate America.
[01:26:13.445 --> 01:26:14.865]  What did Teddy Roosevelt say about that?
[01:26:16.886 --> 01:26:23.428]  Well, he said that we can't tolerate that.
[01:26:23.488 --> 01:26:24.788]  He simply said,
[01:26:29.504 --> 01:26:30.164]  Let me think here.
[01:26:30.204 --> 01:26:33.126]  Let me think about where I had that in my speech.
[01:26:33.426 --> 01:26:35.347]  I wanted to quote that if I could.
[01:26:35.507 --> 01:26:37.128]  Oh sure, take your time, General.
[01:26:37.168 --> 01:26:40.050]  In fact, I've heard several quotes of his.
[01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:41.330]  I'm wondering which one it is.
[01:26:41.411 --> 01:26:43.272]  It's kind of on the tip of my tongue, too.
[01:26:43.972 --> 01:26:45.413]  Okay, let's see here.
[01:26:45.473 --> 01:26:51.276]  You know, I'm just wondering how far this is going to go, how long this is going to go.
[01:26:51.296 --> 01:26:55.559]  I mean, we've got 25 million here now, and if we legalize them,
[01:26:57.324 --> 01:27:05.608]  Then it'll be another 25 million in a few years, a few decades, and they're openly saying this is Mexico, but if Mexico's so great, why do they want to come here?
[01:27:05.628 --> 01:27:09.850]  And then they'll say, well, because America took part of our land, that's what makes Mexico bad.
[01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:12.531]  So, it's just insane, General.
[01:27:13.372 --> 01:27:14.252]  Well, it is.
[01:27:14.592 --> 01:27:17.454]  And, you know, how long can it go?
[01:27:17.534 --> 01:27:19.355]  I don't know how long it can go.
[01:27:20.715 --> 01:27:21.376]  I just don't think...
[01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:28.302]  At the rate that it's been increasing, I don't think it can go very much longer.
[01:27:28.422 --> 01:27:31.023]  I mean, until something is going to give, you know?
[01:27:31.383 --> 01:27:36.964]  Well, have you seen the big CFR, Council on Foreign Relations, proposals being implemented by the Canadian, Mexican, and U.S.
[01:27:37.004 --> 01:27:49.627]  governments, respectively, where they openly say it's really about an American Union, and they're going to use all these illegal aliens to leverage us into submission, to kind of bully the American people?
[01:27:51.091 --> 01:27:52.854]  Uh, yeah, I've seen a little on that, yes.
[01:27:54.096 --> 01:27:56.499]  That's called a military invasion if you ask me.
[01:27:56.519 --> 01:27:59.303]  Well, I don't know what else you could call it, really, you know.
[01:28:00.245 --> 01:28:05.352]  We've had border sheriffs on who say, right now, you know, a lot of them served in Vietnam and they said, this is combat.
[01:28:05.894 --> 01:28:08.415]  The killings, the rocket attacks, the drug gangs.
[01:28:08.835 --> 01:28:12.196]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but Texas, Arizona borders.
[01:28:12.616 --> 01:28:17.397]  The State Department has listed them more dangerous per capita than the West Bank, General.
[01:28:17.897 --> 01:28:18.677]  Yes, yes.
[01:28:19.037 --> 01:28:20.018]  One more segment with you, sir.
[01:28:20.038 --> 01:28:23.138]  I want to get into those quotes and some of your speech.
[01:28:23.158 --> 01:28:29.660]  Take plenty of time to go over it, because I want to hear that when we get back, and then we'll talk about a couple other key issues as well.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:31.941]  This is so important.
[01:28:31.981 --> 01:28:33.381]  America is under attack.
[01:28:34.105 --> 01:28:36.526]  Headline in the Courier-Journal, Freedom's Under Siege.
[01:28:37.186 --> 01:28:38.427]  That's what the retired general says.
[01:28:38.447 --> 01:28:39.267]  He's absolutely right.
[01:28:39.287 --> 01:28:39.727]  We'll be back.
[01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:45.030]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.110]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.130 --> 01:28:50.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.094 --> 01:28:55.915]  Come on, Bill.
[01:28:56.135 --> 01:28:57.956]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[01:28:58.156 --> 01:29:01.318]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:29:01.658 --> 01:29:02.219]  What did you do?
[01:29:02.319 --> 01:29:03.139]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:29:03.239 --> 01:29:03.960]  No, John.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.221]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:29:05.501 --> 01:29:11.024]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:17.568]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:17.909 --> 01:29:20.070]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:23.792]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:29:24.052 --> 01:29:24.452]  Whoa!
[01:29:24.832 --> 01:29:26.053]  What was that website again?
[01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:29.615]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:29.915 --> 01:29:31.035]  Now write this down, John.
[01:29:31.175 --> 01:29:35.477]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:29:35.617 --> 01:29:36.198]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:29:36.478 --> 01:29:37.678]  I'm going there right now.
[01:29:38.079 --> 01:29:38.739]  Check, please!
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.961]  Uh, you got this one right, Bill.
[01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:43.041]  Sure, John.
[01:29:43.262 --> 01:29:47.644]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:49.645]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:50.065]  Deal?
[01:29:51.408 --> 01:29:53.389]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:53.469 --> 01:30:04.173]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:04.553 --> 01:30:09.075]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:09.135 --> 01:30:20.479]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:21.059 --> 01:30:27.927]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:28.307 --> 01:30:30.449]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:35.915]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:30:36.215 --> 01:30:42.524]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.584 --> 01:30:46.770]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:47.011 --> 01:30:47.832]  That's toll free.
[01:30:47.852 --> 01:30:47.892]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.466]  What has been deemed the healthiest oil on the earth?
[01:30:55.006 --> 01:30:56.147]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[01:30:56.467 --> 01:30:58.849]  What did Woman's Day Magazine call the miracle oil?
[01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:00.450]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[01:31:00.891 --> 01:31:06.275]  Why have people reported increased energy, reduction in food craving, and an easier time losing weight?
[01:31:06.735 --> 01:31:08.036]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[01:31:08.356 --> 01:31:09.317]  The answer is clear!
[01:31:09.658 --> 01:31:12.480]  It's time to switch to Virgin Coconut Oil by Nourishing Planet.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:18.204]  Made from organic coconuts, Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil is produced in the pristine Fiji Islands.
[01:31:18.664 --> 01:31:20.486]  Using coconuts within hours of opening,
[01:31:20.846 --> 01:31:28.013]  Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil retains more of the nutrition, including the tocotrienols, which are powerful vitamin E antioxidants.
[01:31:28.373 --> 01:31:33.298]  The minimally processed coconuts allow for delightful taste and the aroma of fresh coconuts.

[01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:56.958]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:58.980]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:07.869 --> 01:32:09.510]  It's simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:18.173]  International financial interests have come in and bought off Congress, bought off the Presidents, doesn't matter if it's Bill Clinton or George Bush, and they're selling us on globalism.
[01:32:18.213 --> 01:32:21.915]  And I've got some of the great quotes by the General here out of the Courier-Journal.
[01:32:22.555 --> 01:32:27.317]  And he went into talking about how our youth aren't taught history anymore, aren't taught the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[01:32:27.337 --> 01:32:33.459]  He said, they just take it for granted, all the freedoms that we have and think that we're just given to us.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:37.121]  Instead, they should be teaching youth the basics, he said, teach them respect,
[01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.580]  And he went on to respect for themselves, tell them the history.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:47.461]  And he said, lots of kids nowadays that are not respectful, and I just think something's important for me to give to my children.
[01:32:47.881 --> 01:32:51.502]  And he went on to talk about, you know, teaching them about our history.
[01:32:51.982 --> 01:32:52.962]  And that really is the key.
[01:32:53.002 --> 01:33:05.925]  I mean, if anybody reads what our founding fathers were fighting for, and you read the Declaration of Independence, which I think is seminal, and then you look at what our government's doing today, and governments all over the Western world, it's an instant replay of what we saw 230-something years ago.
[01:33:08.495 --> 01:33:11.236]  General, did you ever find that Teddy Roosevelt quote?
[01:33:11.516 --> 01:33:13.097]  I sure do.
[01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:19.701]  Well, in 1907, you know, he made some observations and he made the following remarks.
[01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:35.711]  He said, in the first place, we should insist that if an immigrant who comes here in good faith and becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an equal and on an exact equal with everyone else.
[01:33:36.465 --> 01:33:43.551]  For it's an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin.
[01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:51.699]  But this is predicated upon the person becoming in every facet an American and nothing but an American.
[01:33:52.299 --> 01:33:54.381]  There can be no divided allegiance here.
[01:33:54.401 --> 01:34:00.627]  Any man who says that he's an American but something else also isn't an American at all.
[01:34:01.388 --> 01:34:02.889]  We have room but for one flag.
[01:34:03.427 --> 01:34:14.531]  The American flag, and we have room but for one language here, and that's the English language, and we have room for but one sole loyalty, and that loyalty is to the American people.
[01:34:15.452 --> 01:34:24.255]  And then I add, we have no allegiance to the United Nations, nor do we have an allegiance to the World Order that they keep talking about, the Great World Order.
[01:34:24.695 --> 01:34:29.797]  You know, Americans have allegiance, and owe their allegiance, to America.
[01:34:31.746 --> 01:34:34.148]  And then, of course, we have an allegiance above that to God.
[01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:37.111]  We don't get our rights from man.
[01:34:38.132 --> 01:34:40.053]  Our laws are derived from God's law.
[01:34:40.394 --> 01:34:41.515]  Absolutely.
[01:34:41.795 --> 01:34:42.936]  That's exactly right.
[01:34:43.276 --> 01:34:45.759]  Well, you just brought up the $64 million question.
[01:34:46.059 --> 01:34:55.868]  The New World Order, Clinton, Bush, Sr., Jr., they all call for this New World Order, which does get rid of our sovereignty, and it's happening right now.
[01:34:55.908 --> 01:34:56.669]  Can you comment on that?
[01:34:57.529 --> 01:35:03.313]  Well, only to say that apparently it's happening more than people realize.
[01:35:04.134 --> 01:35:13.300]  I'm hearing rumors and I haven't checked them out, even here in Kentucky, about the United Nations controlling some part of our park system.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:22.886]  Back in 99, no excuse me, 98, Kentucky Legislature, Assembly passed a law that the UN had grabbed Mammoth Cave.
[01:35:23.698 --> 01:35:26.399]  And so you're the only state that threw them out.
[01:35:26.979 --> 01:35:35.861]  They have hundreds of other parks and national monuments, Independence Hall, they have the Statue of Liberty, they have the Grand Canyon, so yes sir.
[01:35:36.341 --> 01:35:44.584]  And then they get a buffer zone and the UN has more authority in those regions, I have the law, the executive order, than even our own Congress.
[01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:46.744]  Shameful.
[01:35:47.104 --> 01:35:48.065]  Absolutely shameful.
[01:35:48.405 --> 01:35:48.625]  You know?
[01:35:50.151 --> 01:36:05.138]  But, you know, but Americans have themselves in large part, you know, to blame for this because we have, you know, set back and allowed this to just to go on and on while, you know, of course, we're in the apathy stage and
[01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:13.834]  Just enjoying it, you know, living the good life and saying don't bother me because, you know, I'm having a good time here.
[01:36:14.315 --> 01:36:20.979]  When you talk to fellow military men and women who are still in or who are out, are they starting to wake up to this new world order?
[01:36:21.219 --> 01:36:26.423]  Yeah, it seems to me that they really are and I hope everybody is.
[01:36:27.324 --> 01:36:27.844]  I think just
[01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:35.751]  I think it's been such an insidious thing that, you know, you hear it but you think, oh well, not us.
[01:36:35.851 --> 01:36:36.871]  But it is us.
[01:36:37.111 --> 01:36:37.592]  No, you're right.
[01:36:37.632 --> 01:36:39.272]  It's so horrible it's hard to believe.
[01:36:39.512 --> 01:36:39.792]  I know.
[01:36:40.552 --> 01:36:41.552]  It really is.
[01:36:43.313 --> 01:36:44.433]  Well, here's an example, sir.
[01:36:44.453 --> 01:36:51.854]  A private Spanish company, Centra, partially owned by the King of Spain, Juan Carlos, a big globalist, pro-New World Order.
[01:36:52.274 --> 01:36:57.195]  They came in five years ago, started buying politicians like you or I buy sticks of bubblegum.
[01:36:58.344 --> 01:36:58.805]  That's futilism!
[01:37:21.995 --> 01:37:24.677]  When that happens, it's time to gather at the bridge.
[01:37:25.958 --> 01:37:33.144]  I mean, you know, somebody has to wake people up and just stop this.
[01:37:33.444 --> 01:37:36.527]  You're talking about Concord and Lexington gathering at the bridge?
[01:37:36.547 --> 01:37:37.288]  That's right.
[01:37:37.928 --> 01:37:39.590]  And what did they do at the bridge, General?
[01:37:40.210 --> 01:37:44.013]  Well, they fired the shot heard around the world.
[01:37:45.295 --> 01:37:46.496]  And that's what we've got to do.
[01:37:46.996 --> 01:37:48.097]  We've got to not only
[01:37:48.663 --> 01:38:00.790]  We've got to make ourselves known here in America, but we've got to make the other countries realize that we're not going to stand for this, even though we've been moving in that direction, but we draw our line in the sand and say, this is it.
[01:38:02.211 --> 01:38:10.275]  I saw a Washington Times article three, four years ago now, generals, and I really appreciate the words you just said, I want to get more into that if you have time.
[01:38:10.295 --> 01:38:13.517]  I remember reading, and I couldn't believe it, that the army
[01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:23.004]  Was taking felons who were illegal aliens, and it said aggravated felons, and I called a congressman, it was confirmed, and doing a test program bringing them in.
[01:38:23.205 --> 01:38:29.814]  Then, I saw the statistics last year that 20% of the Army ground force, and even more of the Marines,
[01:38:30.632 --> 01:38:33.693]  Well, I don't care if it's Hispanic Americans making up a huge part of our military.
[01:38:33.773 --> 01:38:35.294]  They're Americans, very patriotic people.
[01:38:35.834 --> 01:38:46.739]  But, that 20% was of Latin American, Mexican Latin American, and that they were originally illegal aliens, who are instantly made legalized the minute they sign on.
[01:38:47.059 --> 01:38:49.561]  I mean, that sounds like the Hessians that the British hired.
[01:38:50.001 --> 01:38:55.923]  I mean, if our military is 20% on the ground, of the ground force over there, number one, were you aware of that?
[01:38:55.943 --> 01:38:57.104]  Number two, what's your comment on it?
[01:38:58.514 --> 01:39:01.915]  Well, no, I was aware that that had happened.
[01:39:01.955 --> 01:39:05.736]  I didn't, I wasn't aware of the percentage that you spoke of, you know.
[01:39:06.036 --> 01:39:19.958]  But, uh, well, you know, once again, like we said at the break, you know, in Greece, you know, when they reached Jerusalem, they got there because all the citizens served in the armed forces.
[01:39:20.058 --> 01:39:22.459]  And when they ceased to become citizens,
[01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:25.075]  That's when they had the trouble, you know?
[01:39:25.155 --> 01:39:26.899]  I mean, when they ceased to become soldiers.
[01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:47.724]  Well, I guess AD-01 you could say is a good place to start until about 400-410 when Alaric sacked Rome, but they began to bring in foreign armies and use mercenary armies made up of Gauls, Visigoths, and Austriagoths.
[01:39:47.764 --> 01:39:52.467]  Is it dangerous to have large groups of foreigners who aren't even citizens of your military?
[01:39:53.748 --> 01:39:59.032]  To me, it would just be unthinkable, but you know, sure it is.
[01:40:00.913 --> 01:40:01.854]  Well, you talked about
[01:40:02.856 --> 01:40:04.537]  You know, now is the time to stand up.
[01:40:04.717 --> 01:40:07.558]  I mean, what are some ways that we can stand up and get involved, General?
[01:40:08.438 --> 01:40:10.019]  Well, you know, I don't know.
[01:40:10.099 --> 01:40:31.827]  One thing that we're doing here in Kentucky, and I sort of initiate this thing, is I'm having youth leadership conferences where I bring in sophomores and juniors in high school, and I give them a copy of the Constitution, and we talk about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and we talk about responsibilities, and I give them the history of the flag, and
[01:40:32.782 --> 01:40:37.224]  And some things like that, and talk about the free enterprise system and so forth.
[01:40:37.324 --> 01:40:45.848]  And you know, these kids come in, and the first one I held, I was somewhat concerned as to what maybe their response was going to be, you know?
[01:40:46.848 --> 01:40:49.149]  And these kids came in there, and they hadn't heard this.
[01:40:49.509 --> 01:40:53.211]  I mean, you know, half of them don't know the pledge to the flag.
[01:40:54.412 --> 01:40:57.173]  But they sit there, and they soak it up just like a sponge.
[01:40:57.333 --> 01:40:58.633]  I mean, they're so attentive.
[01:41:00.738 --> 01:41:04.159]  And we have about, oh I guess, five hours of it, you know.
[01:41:04.439 --> 01:41:08.981]  Well I have an online and video bookstore, and every order we get we put free.
[01:41:09.441 --> 01:41:19.925]  The best pocket constitution I've found, it's put out by folks in Arizona, and we buy them by the thousands, and put multiple copies in most of the orders, and the smaller orders just one.
[01:41:20.803 --> 01:41:28.288]  And it has the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, famous quotes, what the jury is supposed to do, and the grand jury.
[01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:31.730]  So I think that is the big solution.
[01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:33.111]  People just don't know who we are.
[01:41:33.131 --> 01:41:33.831]  That's right.
[01:41:34.612 --> 01:41:42.096]  And these kids, you know, it's like a drip in the ocean, but by the same token, it's a start.
[01:41:42.216 --> 01:41:49.601]  And the military or the world wars, they're having these youth leadership conferences all over the United States.
[01:41:50.396 --> 01:41:58.421]  And very successful, and of course the Freedoms Foundation up at Valley Forge, they also have them.
[01:41:58.661 --> 01:41:59.842]  Well, I went to public school.
[01:41:59.902 --> 01:42:01.583]  They taught us nothing about the Bill of Rights.
[01:42:02.003 --> 01:42:04.044]  Told us the Second Amendment wasn't a right to keep guns.
[01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.165]  That's about all they did tell us.
[01:42:05.665 --> 01:42:07.326]  College tried to teach me the same thing.
[01:42:07.726 --> 01:42:12.729]  So we've got to take these school boards back over and ensure that the U.S.
[01:42:12.749 --> 01:42:17.192]  history is mandatory and that most of it be the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:42:17.822 --> 01:42:41.017]  Well, that's right, and you've heard the new drive, I think, even in California, they may be doing it, where they're only teaching, you know, from the Civil War forward, saying that all that happened before that is, you know, is no longer of value, but we need for everyone to understand from the Civil War forward who we are, you know.
[01:42:41.657 --> 01:42:45.120]  And that's when we saw the federal control, that's why they want to teach that.
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:45.520]  Yeah.
[01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:55.802]  What do you think of the Supreme Court ruling that private interest can come grab your land with the government if they want it without just compensation?
[01:42:56.943 --> 01:42:59.485]  Well, I can't say on the air what I think of that.
[01:43:01.767 --> 01:43:02.447]  It's crazy!
[01:43:02.467 --> 01:43:07.211]  Did you hear this new thing about whistleblowers that see criminality aren't allowed to whistleblow?
[01:43:08.519 --> 01:43:09.059]  Yeah.
[01:43:09.179 --> 01:43:12.801]  You know, and it goes on and on.
[01:43:13.201 --> 01:43:16.403]  I mean, it is just out of control.
[01:43:16.863 --> 01:43:18.484]  It is absolutely out of control.
[01:43:19.244 --> 01:43:27.388]  But the good news I hear from you is that your former and current colleagues in the military are really starting to wake up, you said, to the New World Order?
[01:43:27.708 --> 01:43:28.468]  Yeah.
[01:43:29.749 --> 01:43:32.730]  And they're realizing, you know, hey, wait a minute, you know,
[01:43:33.977 --> 01:43:43.371]  You know, we are a sovereign nation, and we need to remain a sovereign nation, you know, and now the world trade and all that, you know, without getting into all that.
[01:43:45.482 --> 01:43:55.446]  Sure, you can't be an isolationist, but it's still your country, and you've still got to... Well, I agree, but what does the World Trade Organization do, founded in 1995?
[01:43:56.266 --> 01:44:04.529]  Congress has ceded more of their authority to them than Congress even still has, and they actually, every few months, there's multi-billion dollar fines on U.S.
[01:44:04.569 --> 01:44:06.150]  companies and the U.S.
[01:44:06.190 --> 01:44:08.931]  government, and I've looked at the documents I've had Congressmen on.
[01:44:09.331 --> 01:44:11.752]  A private group has more control than our Congress?
[01:44:13.867 --> 01:44:19.713]  Well, you know, see, they pulled the plug and they're going to drain us every way they can.
[01:44:20.214 --> 01:44:21.976]  And they're finding all kinds of ways to do it.
[01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:28.162]  And we're, I don't know, I don't know what our congressmen and those folks are doing up there these days, honestly.
[01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:35.870]  You know, if you leave them there for a while so they get experience, it seems like, you know, the longer they stay, the worse it is.
[01:44:37.407 --> 01:44:44.998]  Initially, the initial objective to go up and serve a term or so and come back and go to work might not be bad, you know?
[01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:50.286]  What you'd lose in the efficiency you'd make up in other ways, you know?
[01:44:51.061 --> 01:44:51.721]  Well, that's another thing.
[01:44:51.741 --> 01:44:57.264]  They've made politics boring, dry, no one talks about it, so it's like an unknown country to people.
[01:44:57.644 --> 01:45:09.109]  It's exciting to go down to the Texas Legislature and catch bribery in the hall on video and get it on TV locally and get people in trouble and get committee chairmen removed and defeat legislation.
[01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:11.230]  I'm so sick of people saying we can't affect change.
[01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:17.634]  You know, in my life, I found, General, if you just start putting one foot in front of the other, that doesn't mean you're doing a perfect job.
[01:45:17.914 --> 01:45:21.697]  At least you've got motivation and you're not going to back off.
[01:45:22.637 --> 01:45:25.619]  We almost always win, it will just get on the field.
[01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:26.680]  Well, that's right.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.962]  That's right, but you're not going to win if you don't play.
[01:45:30.542 --> 01:45:32.263]  So your point's well made.
[01:45:32.924 --> 01:45:36.246]  Let me just say this about my speech on Monday.
[01:45:36.286 --> 01:45:36.826]  Sure, General.
[01:45:38.266 --> 01:45:43.128]  The response was overwhelming, the applause throughout the speech.
[01:45:44.009 --> 01:45:46.610]  After it was over, it was 92 degrees.
[01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:53.673]  People stood in line for about 15 minutes to come by and shake my hand and express their appreciation.
[01:45:54.373 --> 01:46:01.936]  Now, I received one letter yesterday from a disgruntled, and he's a former veteran.
[01:46:02.117 --> 01:46:02.917]  What did he not like?
[01:46:04.465 --> 01:46:10.290]  He didn't like the fact that I said that we should have no allegiance to the United Nations or the world order.
[01:46:11.472 --> 01:46:12.673]  That was one thing he didn't like.
[01:46:13.393 --> 01:46:21.080]  He said he had his grandson with him and he didn't think any senior officer should be saying those types of things because I was not
[01:46:21.664 --> 01:46:22.665]  Up with the times!
[01:46:24.046 --> 01:46:32.072]  Oh, you're not... Yeah, let's get rid of this old-fashioned freedom, and family, and private property, and end with this great new, you don't own nothing!
[01:46:32.353 --> 01:46:33.173]  And you're a slave!
[01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:34.114]  Boy, that's a lot better!
[01:46:34.795 --> 01:46:36.136]  That guy ought to be ashamed of himself.
[01:46:36.176 --> 01:46:38.217]  So what... I mean, get into this New World Order.
[01:46:38.257 --> 01:46:42.321]  What specifically, or thereabouts, General, did you say about this New World Order?
[01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:46.344]  Well, all I said was that we owe no allegiance
[01:46:47.097 --> 01:46:53.839]  And to United Nations, you know the episode of the guy refusing to wear the beret, you know?
[01:46:54.479 --> 01:46:54.799]  Yes.
[01:46:55.679 --> 01:47:00.621]  And Ron Ray, Colonel Ron Ray, here in Kentucky, defended him.
[01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:02.441]  They wanted Michael New to be under U.N.
[01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:03.061]  command.
[01:47:03.301 --> 01:47:03.802]  Exactly.
[01:47:04.482 --> 01:47:05.262]  That's right, see?
[01:47:05.842 --> 01:47:08.223]  And he took a stand.
[01:47:08.463 --> 01:47:10.623]  He didn't sign up, he didn't swear to serve them.
[01:47:10.803 --> 01:47:12.744]  No, absolutely not, see?
[01:47:13.687 --> 01:47:24.300]  And so, but all I said about the World Order was that we owe no allegiance to them or to the United Nations, and that upset him terribly.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:27.484]  What did you think of Mexican troops in New Orleans, quote, helping?
[01:47:27.804 --> 01:47:28.104]  Yeah.
[01:47:28.625 --> 01:47:29.326]  What did you think of that?
[01:47:30.928 --> 01:47:33.449]  Well, I didn't know if they just had a token.
[01:47:33.549 --> 01:47:35.490]  I don't know how many they had down there and so forth.
[01:47:35.530 --> 01:47:36.570]  It was about 500 there.
[01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:38.211]  They had them in Austin.
[01:47:38.231 --> 01:47:40.452]  They had them in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston.
[01:47:40.812 --> 01:47:41.812]  It was thousands, sir.
[01:47:42.012 --> 01:47:43.913]  My point is, we didn't need their help.
[01:47:44.173 --> 01:47:46.234]  That was just to get us accustomed to foreign troops.
[01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:52.036]  It's like after 9-11 we had NATO Dutch AWACS flying around.
[01:47:52.056 --> 01:47:55.457]  Yeah, we really need that, you know.
[01:47:56.278 --> 01:47:57.278]  Oh my, I tell you.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.506]  So, you talked about meeting them at the bridge.
[01:48:04.409 --> 01:48:12.301]  What is your line in the sand, not just in the information war you're engaging in now, General, but what would cause you to physically start doing something?
[01:48:14.009 --> 01:48:23.173]  Well, I am physically doing something with these YLCs and so forth, and traveling around to talk to as many student groups and so forth.
[01:48:23.213 --> 01:48:27.295]  That is physical activism, but you're talking about... I know, I know.
[01:48:27.595 --> 01:48:32.317]  I know that's figurative and you don't want to come out and say it, but you're saying what we all feel here, too.
[01:48:32.998 --> 01:48:38.440]  Well, I'm just saying that we all have got to wake up to what's going on in this country.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.622]  We've got to look at what's happening, and as I made the point
[01:48:43.038 --> 01:48:45.299]  You know, we're involved in two wars.
[01:48:45.419 --> 01:48:55.762]  We're involved in the war in Iraq, and it's my opinion that if troops are left alone, but given what they need, we really don't have to worry ourselves.
[01:48:56.122 --> 01:49:00.424]  Of course, the media wants us nightly to be excited about it and so forth.
[01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:02.444]  We don't have to worry about Iraq.
[01:49:02.524 --> 01:49:03.545]  It'll almost take care of itself.
[01:49:03.765 --> 01:49:06.246]  What we really better take a look at quickly is
[01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:12.496]  Here in the United States and our freedoms because they're slipping away.
[01:49:12.737 --> 01:49:13.197]  No, you're right.
[01:49:13.237 --> 01:49:15.100]  We need Operation American Freedom.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.201]  That's right.
[01:49:16.481 --> 01:49:17.603]  That's exactly right.
[01:49:17.983 --> 01:49:19.205]  And I mean, we need...
[01:49:20.307 --> 01:49:21.208]  To do it now.
[01:49:21.348 --> 01:49:25.792]  We can't just keep talking about it and letting it go and putting it off.
[01:49:26.152 --> 01:49:31.276]  General, I want to get you back up in a few months to check in with us and get your view on what's happening then.
[01:49:31.676 --> 01:49:38.202]  It's been an amazing interview and we've been so honored to have Major General Carl D. Black, U.S.
[01:49:38.282 --> 01:49:39.723]  Air Force, retired on.
[01:49:41.004 --> 01:49:42.445]  It has been great visiting with you, sir.
[01:49:42.725 --> 01:49:44.327]  You too, Alex, and thank you so much.
[01:49:44.467 --> 01:49:45.247]  Thank you for the time.
[01:49:45.307 --> 01:49:45.848]  Godspeed.
[01:49:46.108 --> 01:49:47.049]  And the same to you.
[01:49:47.289 --> 01:49:47.609]  Goodbye.
[01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:48.190]  Take care.
[01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:52.843]  Alright, I've got some comments on that interview when we get back, and we'll start taking your calls and covering other news.
[01:49:52.883 --> 01:49:53.324]  Stand by.
[01:49:53.904 --> 01:50:02.167]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:50:02.367 --> 01:50:04.688]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[01:50:05.288 --> 01:50:14.131]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag tear operation.
[01:50:14.671 --> 01:50:18.173]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:50:18.614 --> 01:50:39.447]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:50:39.748 --> 01:50:43.390]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:50:43.931 --> 01:50:45.174]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[01:50:54.128 --> 01:50:58.011]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:03.696]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.976 --> 01:51:14.324]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.504 --> 01:51:18.848]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:19.028 --> 01:51:19.829]  We're good to go!
[01:51:34.125 --> 01:51:38.609]  Yes, the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:55.555 --> 01:51:55.895]  I think so.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.441]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.319 --> 01:52:43.401]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.561 --> 01:52:49.524]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.627 --> 01:52:57.368]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:57.388 --> 01:53:01.231]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:12.046 --> 01:53:16.447]  You could tell that General Black wanted to say a lot more.
[01:53:17.348 --> 01:53:20.469]  And he did when Kevin talked to him about 45 minutes the other day.
[01:53:20.489 --> 01:53:21.929]  I'm like, get off the phone, Kevin.
[01:53:21.949 --> 01:53:23.490]  Let's get the guy on the air.
[01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:27.391]  But yeah, he says the military is waking up to the New World Order.
[01:53:28.422 --> 01:53:37.825]  We didn't get into him over North Korea flying air cover when they were about to go to war with the Pueblo and they grabbed that spy ship and a bunch of other stories.
[01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:40.386]  He flew the air superiority fighters.
[01:53:41.387 --> 01:53:41.967]  Amazing stuff.
[01:53:41.987 --> 01:53:45.008]  We didn't have time to get into all that, but he wanted to say so much more.
[01:53:45.048 --> 01:53:50.670]  But those guys are so drilled not to criticize the government, not to criticize Bush, but he said quite a lot.
[01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:52.170]  Meet them at the bridge.
[01:53:52.711 --> 01:53:53.811]  Stand up against the government.
[01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:55.910]  That's what it's coming down to.
[01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:57.371]  Look, this country's going bye-bye.
[01:53:57.451 --> 01:53:58.731]  Right now, American Union.
[01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:00.271]  They try to keep it quiet.
[01:54:00.331 --> 01:54:01.292]  It's happening right now.
[01:54:01.392 --> 01:54:02.692]  Blanket, total amnesty.
[01:54:03.592 --> 01:54:06.053]  And the neocons are busy on the radio lying about it.
[01:54:06.253 --> 01:54:09.554]  Their main job, pacify you conservatives.
[01:54:09.594 --> 01:54:14.135]  Globalists posing as conservatives to fool you just long enough.
[01:54:15.009 --> 01:54:20.351]  And as soon as their police state's in place, they're going to economically rape the living daylights out of us.
[01:54:20.371 --> 01:54:21.611]  They don't want good economies.
[01:54:21.891 --> 01:54:23.211]  They're threatened by free market.
[01:54:23.492 --> 01:54:24.992]  They're monopoly men.
[01:54:26.732 --> 01:54:32.734]  They'd rather sit on top of a pile of rubble and rule it than to just be normal people in a free country.
[01:54:33.114 --> 01:54:35.755]  Like the devil said, I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.
[01:54:36.575 --> 01:54:37.736]  I think Shakespeare said that.
[01:54:37.756 --> 01:54:38.576]  The devil didn't really.
[01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:42.833]  Because the devil doesn't really reign in hell, but that's the figurative point, rather.
[01:54:43.233 --> 01:54:44.854]  Reign in hell and serve in heaven.
[01:54:45.515 --> 01:54:46.936]  And that's what we're coming down to here.
[01:54:47.437 --> 01:54:50.240]  I want to go to Todd and Bob and Tom and many others that are holding.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:55.405]  We're going to take masses of calls in the third hour that's only a few minutes away.
[01:54:56.746 --> 01:55:03.072]  I do want to briefly encourage all of you to come to the huge 9-11 symposium that we're going to be having in Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:55:04.488 --> 01:55:05.608]  It's time to make a decision.
[01:55:05.628 --> 01:55:06.869]  The tickets are going quick.
[01:55:06.909 --> 01:55:07.689]  It's going to be great.
[01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:09.210]  Surprise guests are going to be there.
[01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:22.715]  Professor Stephen Jones, Professor Jim Fetzer, Dylan Avery of Loose Change 2 fame, William Rodriguez, the big hero of 9-11 going in to save people, with the firefighters, the janitor, Jimmy Walters.
[01:55:22.935 --> 01:55:26.116]  We're going to have myself giving a speech, of course.
[01:55:26.894 --> 01:55:27.455]  It's all coming up!
[01:55:27.475 --> 01:55:29.438]  Get your tickets now at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253.
[01:55:39.501 --> 01:55:42.622]  3139.
[01:55:39.581 --> 01:55:42.622]  And while you're on the site, get the videos.
[01:55:42.662 --> 01:55:43.442]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[01:55:43.482 --> 01:55:44.403]  Get Masters of Terror.
[01:55:44.703 --> 01:55:46.023]  Get Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:55:46.063 --> 01:55:47.363]  Get Martial Law.
[01:55:47.403 --> 01:55:48.084]  Get my films.
[01:55:48.144 --> 01:55:48.984]  Make copies of them.
[01:55:49.364 --> 01:55:50.865]  Get them out to people now.
[01:55:51.005 --> 01:55:53.885]  Don't let the globalists stop this message from getting out.
[01:55:53.905 --> 01:55:55.126]  They're very afraid of it.
[01:55:55.546 --> 01:55:58.747]  Again, InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:58.767 --> 01:56:03.488]  Or see them all online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:04.049 --> 01:56:05.229]  That's a great activist tool as well.
[01:56:05.842 --> 01:56:08.183]  Let's go ahead and drop to Todd in Minnesota.
[01:56:08.203 --> 01:56:09.083]  Todd, thanks for holding.
[01:56:09.503 --> 01:56:09.943]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:10.463]  How are you doing?
[01:56:10.724 --> 01:56:10.944]  Good.
[01:56:11.404 --> 01:56:12.704]  I'm a first-time caller, actually.
[01:56:12.784 --> 01:56:15.885]  Veteran and currently a doctoral student here at the University of Minnesota.
[01:56:16.865 --> 01:56:24.348]  Before I get to the reason I called, I did have a quick question, or at least a comment, concerning last year's alleged November massacre.
[01:56:24.888 --> 01:56:34.391]  Now, if I understand from the broadcast earlier on your show, ABC News had an interview with that 12-year-old survivor one week after the event.
[01:56:35.083 --> 01:56:39.685]  So I'm thinking to my mind, why didn't ABC News break this story far earlier?
[01:56:40.645 --> 01:56:44.086]  Well, actually, it's been in the news a few months in the foreign press.
[01:56:44.707 --> 01:56:46.387]  Foreign press conducted that interview.
[01:56:46.467 --> 01:56:47.448]  ABC obtained it.
[01:56:47.808 --> 01:56:48.288]  Oh, I see.
[01:56:49.648 --> 01:56:54.430]  But, sir, I mean, you know, CBS knew about Abu Ghraib for four months before they broke it.
[01:56:55.351 --> 01:56:56.991]  So, I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:58.432]  It's a legitimate question, sure.
[01:56:58.892 --> 01:57:00.372]  I mean, so they are holding on to it.
[01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:01.973]  They are covering it up.
[01:57:03.889 --> 01:57:06.389]  Well, I wanted to get to the reason I called.
[01:57:06.490 --> 01:57:06.650]  Sure.
[01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:07.170]  Stay there.
[01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.590]  Stay there.
[01:57:07.610 --> 01:57:07.850]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:08.050 --> 01:57:09.050]  Got to hold one more minute.
[01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:11.370]  To be technical, 70 seconds.
[01:57:12.131 --> 01:57:13.331]  Got the station ID, too.
[01:57:13.431 --> 01:57:16.411]  So, when we get back, network ID to be technical.
[01:57:17.632 --> 01:57:18.332]  Saying that too much.
[01:57:18.392 --> 01:57:19.912]  Be technical, be technical, be technical.
[01:57:20.852 --> 01:57:21.892]  I'm brain dead, folks.
[01:57:22.092 --> 01:57:23.473]  I went to bed real late last night.
[01:57:23.513 --> 01:57:24.773]  My kids wake me up at 6 a.m.
[01:57:24.813 --> 01:57:25.233]  every day.
[01:57:26.693 --> 01:57:27.073]  All right.
[01:57:27.133 --> 01:57:29.754]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:30.454 --> 01:57:30.954]  Stay with us.
[01:57:34.145 --> 01:57:38.367]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.407 --> 01:57:38.847]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.987 --> 01:57:39.607]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.767 --> 01:57:43.169]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:47.711]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.991 --> 01:57:49.471]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.246 --> 01:58:02.189]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:06.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.334 --> 01:58:10.637]  Now into hour number three on this June 1, 2006 edition.
[01:58:10.717 --> 01:58:12.258]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:13.139 --> 01:58:19.304]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[01:58:20.805 --> 01:58:25.289]  They've all got the basic same information every day, but every site has three or four, sometimes more, things
[01:58:26.391 --> 01:58:26.791]  We're good to go.
[01:58:45.214 --> 01:58:46.716]  I want to take 20 calls in this hour.
[01:58:46.756 --> 01:58:52.701]  I'm always saying, oh, I'm going to take a bunch of calls this hour, and then I don't, because I'm covering news, or caller brings up key issues.
[01:58:53.322 --> 01:58:55.504]  But sometimes I do it, and today's one of those days.
[01:58:55.564 --> 01:58:58.527]  So that means I can't give you all as much time, but that's okay.
[01:58:58.847 --> 01:59:02.351]  Tom in Minnesota, finish up, then I'm going to go to Bob, Tom, Phil, and others.
[01:59:02.391 --> 01:59:03.392]  Excuse me, Todd, go ahead.
[01:59:03.712 --> 01:59:03.932]  Sure.
[01:59:04.052 --> 01:59:09.255]  With my humble understanding, I disagree with using the Second Amendment for one's right to own and possess a firearm.
[01:59:09.736 --> 01:59:14.879]  I mean, often I hear you state that we should only focus on issues that cannot be debated, rather than other issues.
[01:59:15.919 --> 01:59:23.244]  And, you know, in the spirit of that concept, you hear too many people debate the intent and meaning of a well-regulated militia, and rather, in my humble opinion,
[01:59:23.684 --> 01:59:28.187]  I think we should maybe focus on the 9th and 10th Amendment for a stronger defense against the firearms.
[01:59:28.287 --> 01:59:30.549]  And I'll hang up now and just hear what you have to say.
[01:59:30.569 --> 01:59:31.609]  Oh, now I see what you're saying.
[01:59:31.649 --> 01:59:38.754]  You're saying that the 9th Amendment says we've got every right under the sun that's not expressly listed here.
[01:59:38.814 --> 01:59:39.855]  We have total rights.
[01:59:40.275 --> 01:59:43.697]  And the 10th Amendment also basically states that.
[01:59:43.877 --> 01:59:44.278]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:44.838 --> 01:59:47.840]  So you're not debating what the 2nd Amendment says?
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.261]  No, I'm not debating what the Second Amendment says.
[01:59:50.662 --> 01:59:57.226]  It's just, from my humble understanding, it seems to me that we would have a stronger case using the Ninth and the Tenth Amendment rather than the Second.
[01:59:57.546 --> 01:59:58.407]  Well, sir, I don't know.
[01:59:58.607 --> 02:00:02.410]  I mean, you sound like a smart guy, but how many of the Federalist Papers you read?
[02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:04.051]  Um, very little.
[02:00:04.911 --> 02:00:07.553]  Well, I'm kind of a nerd, so I've read them all.
[02:00:07.693 --> 02:00:07.993]  Cool.
[02:00:08.414 --> 02:00:10.175]  And I've probably read 50 books.
[02:00:11.094 --> 02:00:14.316]  About the Founding Fathers from different angles, so I appreciate your call.
[02:00:14.916 --> 02:00:23.780]  Here I am saying I'll go to calls quickly and he brings up a huge issue of history and law and the practice of the customs of this country.
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:30.402]  Many of the Bill of Rights are multiple clauses in each article.
[02:00:31.503 --> 02:00:33.364]  As the First Amendment is
[02:00:35.054 --> 02:00:37.435]  Freedom of religion and keeping the government out.
[02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:38.496]  They can make no law.
[02:00:38.976 --> 02:00:39.797]  Then it's press.
[02:00:39.957 --> 02:00:40.878]  Then it's assembly.
[02:00:41.018 --> 02:00:41.978]  Then it's petition.
[02:00:42.859 --> 02:00:43.219]  Okay?
[02:00:43.719 --> 02:00:43.959]  So what?
[02:00:43.979 --> 02:00:44.900]  It's five things.
[02:00:46.321 --> 02:00:46.901]  Five things.
[02:00:47.161 --> 02:00:48.062]  Well, let me count them up.
[02:00:48.142 --> 02:00:52.124]  Well, four if you don't count the two different base religious rights.
[02:00:53.805 --> 02:00:57.968]  And so the media will debate it and act like the First Amendment only has one facet.
[02:00:59.469 --> 02:00:59.789]  Okay?
[02:01:01.556 --> 02:01:03.057]  Well, it's the same thing with the Second Amendment.
[02:01:03.577 --> 02:01:04.738]  I've read the debates on it.
[02:01:04.858 --> 02:01:06.919]  It's one of the few things that there was no debate on.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.244]  It is saying that there will be a well-regulated militia in every state, raised from the people.
[02:01:16.244 --> 02:01:17.485]  And then, there's a comma.
[02:01:18.163 --> 02:01:20.745]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:01:21.006 --> 02:01:25.490]  That is to build a base of crack shots of people that have guns.
[02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:28.853]  There was like 98% gun ownership at the time.
[02:01:29.213 --> 02:01:32.356]  A professor, top professor in Chicago, wrote a big lie about it.
[02:01:32.596 --> 02:01:35.219]  He was caught falsifying documents because it was a total lie.
[02:01:35.479 --> 02:01:37.921]  Historians went and looked it up and said, you're a complete liar.
[02:01:38.802 --> 02:01:40.604]  I mean, we were complete gun freaks.
[02:01:41.343 --> 02:01:43.205]  Because it was so dangerous to live.
[02:01:44.886 --> 02:01:48.610]  From the time we got here, we were a frontier society and always pushing that.
[02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:53.394]  I mean, the war started over the British trying to come and take the guns.
[02:01:53.694 --> 02:01:55.516]  It'll probably start again over that!
[02:01:58.178 --> 02:02:04.224]  And so I'm glad our listener isn't claiming there isn't a Second Amendment, but the globalists try to take the well-regulated militia part.
[02:02:04.744 --> 02:02:05.505]  That's like saying
[02:02:06.443 --> 02:02:11.725]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:02:11.785 --> 02:02:16.286]  I'm going, well it says they can make no law, so that means there's no freedom of the press.
[02:02:16.386 --> 02:02:17.626]  It's separate thoughts.
[02:02:18.446 --> 02:02:21.927]  The First Amendment is saying you've got these four things.
[02:02:24.268 --> 02:02:25.128]  It's like Hayden.
[02:02:25.168 --> 02:02:28.849]  Hayden goes and grabs the fourth and says reasonable.
[02:02:28.889 --> 02:02:31.130]  Well then it gives the definition of what reasonable is.
[02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:32.911]  He says, no I ignore that part.
[02:02:33.191 --> 02:02:34.371]  I just say we're reasonable.
[02:02:37.282 --> 02:02:39.083]  Oh my goodness, it's unbelievable.
[02:02:39.143 --> 02:02:40.264]  There's no debating it.
[02:02:40.284 --> 02:02:42.685]  You've got a total right to own machine guns.
[02:02:42.705 --> 02:02:43.465]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.867 --> 02:02:54.131]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:02:54.151 --> 02:02:56.652]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[02:02:57.252 --> 02:03:06.097]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:03:06.617 --> 02:03:10.139]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[02:03:10.579 --> 02:03:31.387]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:03:31.687 --> 02:03:35.429]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:37.133]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[02:05:40.721 --> 02:05:41.642]  Box 281 Wildwood PA 15091.
[02:05:46.653 --> 02:05:48.834]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.414 --> 02:05:52.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.295 --> 02:06:00.439]  There are people out there who say the Second Amendment doesn't provide an individual right to keep and bear arms.
[02:06:02.599 --> 02:06:08.882]  And the state police are taught in Texas and all over the country now that there's no more Fourth Amendment, that they're allowed to search you without a warrant,
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:16.002]  And we've even had the old Sheriff Margo Fraser get up on ABC Local after they searched a whole sector of a neighborhood for drugs and found nothing.
[02:06:16.442 --> 02:06:19.183]  She got up and said, well, we don't need warrants anymore at the press conference.
[02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:21.763]  We don't need warrants anymore.
[02:06:21.783 --> 02:06:22.324]  Who told you?
[02:06:22.604 --> 02:06:24.084]  Oh, the bureaucracy says so?
[02:06:24.384 --> 02:06:26.585]  Just because government says.
[02:06:26.865 --> 02:06:31.826]  Just because General Hayden gets up and says, oh no, the Fourth Amendment says nothing about probable cause.
[02:06:32.146 --> 02:06:34.647]  It just says we have to be reasonable, and I say it's reasonable.
[02:06:36.053 --> 02:06:43.719]  So when a cop's going, you didn't wear your seatbelt, or I want to search, and what's your problem, or why don't you want me to search, I don't want you to break a law, officer!
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.702]  I don't want you to stab a big giant dagger in America's heart!
[02:06:47.062 --> 02:06:49.764]  Well, this might stop drugs or guns or something.
[02:06:49.824 --> 02:06:50.705]  Oh, shut up!
[02:06:51.105 --> 02:06:53.487]  Your bosses ship the cocaine and heroin.
[02:06:53.667 --> 02:06:55.028]  They've been caught hundreds of times.
[02:06:55.289 --> 02:06:56.390]  Just shut up!
[02:06:57.190 --> 02:06:58.031]  Shut up!
[02:06:59.637 --> 02:07:04.481]  Big Pharma just got a law passed last year to forcibly, psychologically test all the kids in America.
[02:07:04.901 --> 02:07:08.343]  People are like, well, it hasn't happened yet in my town because we're fighting it at the state level.
[02:07:08.363 --> 02:07:14.768]  And again, you're pushing drugs on us, but then the illegal drugs are bad.
[02:07:14.848 --> 02:07:15.649]  It's all bad.
[02:07:17.690 --> 02:07:26.677]  Your bosses 75 years ago made narcotics illegal because they were the families that had the 100% importation monopolies and they lost monopolies.
[02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:33.092]  So they made it illegal to jack the prices up at the end of Prohibition because they didn't have liquor anymore.
[02:07:34.072 --> 02:07:39.894]  It was the elites that used the Prohibition, as you can go research this, to actually ban alcohol in this country.
[02:07:40.594 --> 02:07:42.014]  To jack up prices.
[02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:43.695]  Man!
[02:07:44.255 --> 02:07:45.295]  It's real simple.
[02:07:45.615 --> 02:07:49.597]  It's like De Beers and their world diamond monopoly through the Oppenheimer family.
[02:07:50.557 --> 02:07:53.058]  Yes, diamonds are semi-precious, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:53.438 --> 02:07:54.018]  Check it out.
[02:07:55.206 --> 02:07:57.606]  They're the ones creating the monopoly.
[02:07:57.626 --> 02:08:05.908]  They're trying to make it illegal to take a diamond out of Australia, out of Europe, out of Africa, out of Arkansas, where they have diamond mines.
[02:08:05.928 --> 02:08:07.128]  They're trying to make it illegal.
[02:08:07.148 --> 02:08:09.789]  I mean, they've been caught in the past.
[02:08:09.869 --> 02:08:12.369]  It's been in the news sending hit teams in against people.
[02:08:12.729 --> 02:08:15.050]  And it's openly in newspapers and they don't get in trouble.
[02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:20.471]  You start trying to build your own diamond mine, buy your own property, find some diamond, start mining it.
[02:08:20.491 --> 02:08:23.051]  There are going to be some boys drop by at 2 a.m.
[02:08:24.835 --> 02:08:25.756]  It's so sick!
[02:08:25.776 --> 02:08:27.316]  Alright, let's hurry through your calls.
[02:08:27.376 --> 02:08:28.197]  I said I'd take a lot of calls.
[02:08:28.217 --> 02:08:28.697]  Let's do it.
[02:08:29.758 --> 02:08:30.718]  Bob in Nebraska.
[02:08:30.758 --> 02:08:31.218]  Go ahead.
[02:08:31.939 --> 02:08:32.539]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:08:32.599 --> 02:08:33.720]  Great show.
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:35.020]  First time caller.
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:35.681]  Welcome!
[02:08:36.121 --> 02:08:38.542]  I've been listening for maybe about a month now.
[02:08:38.562 --> 02:08:40.823]  A friend of mine told me about your site.
[02:08:41.223 --> 02:08:42.664]  Excellent site.
[02:08:42.744 --> 02:08:46.086]  PrisonPlanet and InfoWars.com.
[02:08:46.366 --> 02:08:47.406]  I've got a quick question.
[02:08:47.426 --> 02:08:52.129]  I just recently watched your video, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:58.456]  And they got a song in there about, uh, when you can take it from my cold, dead hands.
[02:08:58.556 --> 02:09:02.158]  That's Dave, that's Dave Von Kleist, was kind enough to let me use that.
[02:09:02.198 --> 02:09:04.840]  And if you look at Dave Von Kleist.
[02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:09.984]  Von Kleist.
[02:09:10.024 --> 02:09:11.706]  He actually has a show on this network.
[02:09:11.766 --> 02:09:12.947]  It's on in the morning.
[02:09:13.927 --> 02:09:14.368]  Excellent.
[02:09:14.988 --> 02:09:17.830]  You can rant, you can rave, you can make your demands.
[02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:21.493]  Hey, uh, do you guys have that in the computer up there or does Dave play that himself?
[02:09:23.664 --> 02:09:24.224]  Oh, darn it.
[02:09:25.184 --> 02:09:26.645]  We have the CD, dig it up.
[02:09:26.865 --> 02:09:28.085]  How about we play it for you at the end?
[02:09:28.525 --> 02:09:29.485]  Hey, that's excellent.
[02:09:30.605 --> 02:09:31.986]  I got two more quick points.
[02:09:33.386 --> 02:09:36.566]  You brought one of them up just a little bit ago about that line in the sand.
[02:09:36.867 --> 02:09:41.867]  If we look back in history, our forefathers will tell us where that line in the sand is.
[02:09:42.828 --> 02:09:44.368]  And they wrote it down in that Bill of Rights.
[02:09:44.888 --> 02:09:47.409]  If they tell us we can't talk, we shoot.
[02:09:48.949 --> 02:09:49.629]  If they tell us
[02:09:50.427 --> 02:09:54.050]  You know, they try and take our guns, as the British tried to take our guns before.
[02:09:54.070 --> 02:09:55.271]  We fight.
[02:09:57.093 --> 02:09:57.813]  It's really simple.
[02:09:57.873 --> 02:09:59.715]  They try and tell us what religion we can have.
[02:10:00.456 --> 02:10:00.936]  We fight.
[02:10:01.076 --> 02:10:04.779]  If we don't, we don't deserve any of that, and we've totally disgraced our forefathers.
[02:10:04.799 --> 02:10:06.020]  No, no, that's all throughout history.
[02:10:06.161 --> 02:10:10.204]  If you want freedom, and you want your children to not be slaves, you're going to have to fight for it.
[02:10:10.784 --> 02:10:10.985]  Yep.
[02:10:11.225 --> 02:10:12.126]  I mean, that's the way it is.
[02:10:12.206 --> 02:10:13.947]  If you want to survive, you've got to fight for it.
[02:10:14.007 --> 02:10:16.970]  Whether it's the lion out there, you know,
[02:10:18.254 --> 02:10:20.235]  Catching its dinner so it can survive.
[02:10:20.296 --> 02:10:20.936]  It has to fight for it.
[02:10:21.056 --> 02:10:21.596]  And you're right.
[02:10:21.636 --> 02:10:26.060]  And these elites have replaced other alpha predators in the food chain.
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:29.402]  And these elites actually feed on us as a prey species.
[02:10:30.162 --> 02:10:32.044]  I mean, that's the way it looks like where I'm sitting.
[02:10:32.464 --> 02:10:33.725]  That's what tyranny is, brother!
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.981]  And the very last point I want to make.
[02:10:36.021 --> 02:10:37.701]  Look, let me just add this.
[02:10:38.181 --> 02:10:39.002]  We're a predator.
[02:10:39.062 --> 02:10:40.402]  We are a predator species.
[02:10:40.702 --> 02:10:41.222]  Oh yeah.
[02:10:41.302 --> 02:10:48.025]  And so what happens is, is that people who have really, really strong, brutal instincts start hunting us.
[02:10:48.085 --> 02:10:49.045]  And that's what tyranny is.
[02:10:49.085 --> 02:10:49.685]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:50.566 --> 02:10:53.287]  And the last point I want to make is there's a couple of authors out there.
[02:10:53.327 --> 02:10:57.548]  There's, let's see, Doug Hanks, or I think it's Doug Hanks.
[02:10:57.988 --> 02:10:58.608]  Okay.
[02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:59.049]  P.A.
[02:10:59.089 --> 02:11:00.169]  Loody and Bill Holmes.
[02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:02.670]  They make awesome books.
[02:11:03.717 --> 02:11:07.838]  That will tell you step-by-step how to make your own weapons, America.
[02:11:08.158 --> 02:11:15.739]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of great ways to, and it's good to have those books to be able to build, to build a scatter gun, build a shotgun, build a revolver.
[02:11:16.119 --> 02:11:16.679]  It's all there.
[02:11:16.739 --> 02:11:18.860]  Thanks for the call, I appreciate it.
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:21.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Ohio.
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:21.900]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:11:23.621 --> 02:11:23.921]  Hello?
[02:11:24.261 --> 02:11:24.541]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:25.481 --> 02:11:29.742]  He who beats a sword into a plowshare will plow for him who did not.
[02:11:30.122 --> 02:11:31.262]  Ha ha ha, yeah.
[02:11:32.397 --> 02:11:33.518]  Alex, I'm desperate.
[02:11:33.618 --> 02:11:37.979]  I need that HR number for that military draft from 18 to 42.
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:39.400]  18 to 49?
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:41.160]  Is it 49?
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:42.381]  I don't place the number.
[02:11:42.421 --> 02:11:44.281]  It changes each year as it's reintroduced.
[02:11:44.341 --> 02:11:46.042]  You can call Rangel's office.
[02:11:46.502 --> 02:11:47.582]  They'll give you the bill number.
[02:11:47.622 --> 02:11:48.383]  They introduced it.
[02:11:48.763 --> 02:11:49.583]  And there's two others.
[02:11:49.603 --> 02:11:50.583]  Do you have an 800 number?
[02:11:51.464 --> 02:11:53.104]  I don't know the switchboard number either.
[02:11:53.124 --> 02:11:54.945]  I mean, they change it too every six months.
[02:11:55.165 --> 02:11:56.305]  I don't know the congressional number.
[02:11:56.645 --> 02:12:01.367]  Will somebody out there call in and give me that HR number or SP number?
[02:12:01.869 --> 02:12:02.070]  Sure.
[02:12:02.250 --> 02:12:03.752]  I'm trying to put the word out.
[02:12:03.792 --> 02:12:05.896]  Nobody knows about it and they're hiding it at the library.
[02:12:06.196 --> 02:12:07.058]  They won't give it to you.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:11.525]  Well, the librarian just may not know how to find legislation.
[02:12:11.925 --> 02:12:12.767]  That may be true.
[02:12:12.887 --> 02:12:14.610]  It's called the National Service Act.
[02:12:17.355 --> 02:12:18.435]  National Service Act.
[02:12:18.615 --> 02:12:30.439]  Yeah, so if you type the National Service Act or something like New Draft Law, New Draft Legislation for Conscription, New Conscription Law, Wrangle, type that in.
[02:12:30.459 --> 02:12:32.239]  We had Wrangle on about a year ago.
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:33.580]  You can go find it.
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:34.480]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.081]  Thank you, I appreciate the call there.
[02:12:37.938 --> 02:12:39.679]  Let's talk to Phil in Maryland.
[02:12:39.699 --> 02:12:40.380]  Phil, go ahead.
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:42.201]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:12:42.241 --> 02:12:43.843]  I had a couple questions for the General.
[02:12:43.903 --> 02:13:02.737]  I want to pose them to you about guns, but before I do that, I want to give you a couple words of encouragement up here in rural Maryland, stopping at the convenience store to get a bottle of water, thinking that you're all out here alone by yourself fighting this war on the little bulletin board next to the pay phone where they put up all the lost and found dog and cat signs.
[02:13:03.177 --> 02:13:05.819]  I'm looking at it and there's an InfoWars.com sticker.
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:06.680]  Awesome!
[02:13:07.302 --> 02:13:12.066]  Awesome, and so I gave a friend of mine your Martial Law CD.
[02:13:13.287 --> 02:13:18.012]  We were at the picnic in Memorial Day and, you know, some of the guys sitting around smoking cigars.
[02:13:18.252 --> 02:13:20.073]  I wasn't there and he starts talking about it.
[02:13:20.093 --> 02:13:34.186]  So now the DVD is in play in the neighborhood and he wants to get together and have a chat about this because one of the guys there is from Vietnam and somehow he gets news from China.
[02:13:34.793 --> 02:13:35.374]  We're good to go.
[02:13:52.839 --> 02:13:57.241]  And people are afraid to speak out because they're afraid to get stigmatized, I think, at this point.
[02:13:57.261 --> 02:14:00.223]  Well, number one, 19 guys in a cave couldn't carry it out.
[02:14:00.623 --> 02:14:01.823]  The government had the motive.
[02:14:01.903 --> 02:14:04.245]  Then you start looking at who did it, and there's the evidence.
[02:14:04.565 --> 02:14:06.526]  A patriot is a scarce man, like you said.
[02:14:06.566 --> 02:14:10.548]  Now, I'm going to pose these three questions I have to you that I wanted to pose to the General.
[02:14:11.228 --> 02:14:13.449]  Okay, what percentage of the military
[02:14:14.068 --> 02:14:18.590]  Is going to say yes sir, like they did at 29 Palms.
[02:14:18.610 --> 02:14:21.011]  76% in the average poll that's in the mid-70's say no.
[02:14:21.031 --> 02:14:24.112]  I think when rubber meets the road, 50% will say no.
[02:14:24.532 --> 02:14:28.234]  The other 50% will be badly coordinated and will do it half-heartedly.
[02:14:28.254 --> 02:14:31.775]  The other 5% that are anti-American scum suckers.
[02:14:32.035 --> 02:14:33.576]  Here's the other two questions, Alex.
[02:14:34.316 --> 02:14:35.597]  How is this going to come down?
[02:14:35.617 --> 02:14:36.317]  Because, so what?
[02:14:36.337 --> 02:14:39.979]  I got a thousand rounds of M16, a thousand rounds of .45 or whatever.
[02:14:40.219 --> 02:14:40.619]  So what?
[02:14:40.659 --> 02:14:42.920]  I start shooting in my house and then I'm a prisoner, you know?
[02:14:43.923 --> 02:14:48.106]  And the last question is, well that's it really, I mean how is this going to come down?
[02:14:48.286 --> 02:15:03.615]  I mean I don't want this to happen, but if we go into tyranny, foreign troops, this stuff happens, you know if Martians land and start sucking our blood, I'm being sarcastic, if for whatever reason you decide to go mobile and actually get physical in a hot war, you don't want to wait for them to come to your house.
[02:15:04.916 --> 02:15:08.998]  I mean that's the rules of warfare, it's on your terms, hit and run, you don't want to be targeted.
[02:15:09.708 --> 02:15:12.410]  What, we abandon our houses and become, you know, ripped off?
[02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:13.611]  No, I'm telling you, sir.
[02:15:13.731 --> 02:15:18.956]  I'm just saying, you know, if foreign troops start rolling down the street, you don't wait for them to come to your house.
[02:15:19.396 --> 02:15:20.157]  You hit and run.
[02:15:20.177 --> 02:15:20.797]  You go to them.
[02:15:22.078 --> 02:15:22.398]  Okay.
[02:15:22.739 --> 02:15:24.420]  Well, Alex, keep up the good work, man.
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:25.181]  We're with you.
[02:15:25.281 --> 02:15:35.749]  We... You know, it's... Here you are talking about the handbook booklet, and I get home and my package is in the mail with the bumper stickers and everything, the Citizens' Rulebook.
[02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:39.112]  And this is... America is an idea.
[02:15:39.779 --> 02:15:49.166]  And, you know, the quote that I have from Teddy Roosevelt is that it's, I'll paraphrase it, but it's foreign to the American people to pledge allegiance to a President right or wrong.
[02:15:49.246 --> 02:15:50.887]  It's servile and it's treasonous.
[02:15:51.187 --> 02:15:55.811]  He said it's patriotic to question the President and that it's patriotic to defend the Republic.
[02:15:55.871 --> 02:15:56.671]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:57.132 --> 02:16:02.516]  Let me be clear about this, and it's not cowardly in a guerrilla warfare situation to hit and run.
[02:16:02.936 --> 02:16:06.959]  You hit the enemy, then you deny them the opportunity to hit you.
[02:16:08.064 --> 02:16:15.329]  You hit the enemy for a predetermined amount of time, or if they're badly coordinated and running for the hills, you keep going.
[02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:18.592]  But then when they attack with overwhelming force, you withdraw.
[02:16:19.712 --> 02:16:22.995]  You continue to do that with pinpricks, and pretty soon they'll bleed out.
[02:16:24.436 --> 02:16:27.598]  Believe me, a lot of... Look, evil people are weak scum.
[02:16:28.339 --> 02:16:28.639]  Okay?
[02:16:28.679 --> 02:16:31.541]  A good man can fight ten times harder than a scum sucker.
[02:16:32.068 --> 02:16:34.129]  They're afraid of dying.
[02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:36.731]  People that are evil are fleshly.
[02:16:37.151 --> 02:16:39.152]  People who are evil are self-serving.
[02:16:39.693 --> 02:16:41.754]  People who are evil don't have what it takes.
[02:16:41.954 --> 02:16:44.136]  They're evil because they're weak, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:44.456 --> 02:16:45.957]  And you shouldn't be afraid of these people.
[02:16:46.237 --> 02:16:51.820]  Yeah, ten of them can grab one of us and beat us to death in a jail cell, or starve us to death, or give us diesel treatment.
[02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:52.501]  So what?
[02:16:52.541 --> 02:16:53.641]  That's how heroes die.
[02:16:54.082 --> 02:16:55.783]  Scum dies a million deaths.
[02:16:56.263 --> 02:16:57.604]  And cowards die a thousand.
[02:16:58.311 --> 02:17:00.292]  And I don't want it to go hot war.
[02:17:00.673 --> 02:17:04.756]  The globalists want it to, and they may push it into that, and then it's our backs against the wall.
[02:17:05.636 --> 02:17:09.899]  But heaven help the military if they try what they tried in New Orleans.
[02:17:09.919 --> 02:17:11.680]  By the way, they ran into resistance there, too.
[02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:12.441]  That's been covered up.
[02:17:13.822 --> 02:17:15.343]  And that was all a beta test right there.
[02:17:17.335 --> 02:17:19.416]  I'll tell you what's so cowardly about the B.A.T.F.
[02:17:19.536 --> 02:17:22.177]  They opened fire on the Davidians first, and when the B.A.T.F.
[02:17:22.197 --> 02:17:27.080]  put their hands down, put their hands up and their guns down, the Davidians let them get away.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:28.280]  Then the B.A.T.F.
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:29.181]  came back with the U.S.
[02:17:29.261 --> 02:17:31.142]  Army and murdered those men, women, and children.
[02:17:33.003 --> 02:17:34.403]  Again, those guys got off on it.
[02:17:34.423 --> 02:17:38.866]  Imagine those little kids in those fires when their heads heated up to 500 degrees and popped like grapes.
[02:17:39.986 --> 02:17:43.488]  Bunch of trash, bunch of scum, bunch of maggots.
[02:17:46.141 --> 02:17:54.771]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:17:54.971 --> 02:18:06.224]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:18:06.544 --> 02:18:06.804]  I think?
[02:18:30.405 --> 02:18:34.326]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:35.087 --> 02:18:35.767]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:46.218 --> 02:18:46.658]  Gold.
[02:18:46.998 --> 02:18:48.299]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:48.539 --> 02:18:54.641]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:54.821 --> 02:18:58.642]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:59.003 --> 02:19:00.883]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:00.923 --> 02:19:03.224]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:03.364 --> 02:19:08.606]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat-based
[02:19:08.686 --> 02:19:09.306]  We're good to go.
[02:19:27.773 --> 02:19:28.414]  We're good.
[02:19:46.474 --> 02:19:49.777]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:19:50.258 --> 02:19:52.420]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:58.325]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[02:19:58.845 --> 02:20:04.731]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution, to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[02:20:46.022 --> 02:20:48.584]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[02:20:48.925 --> 02:20:50.466]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:20:50.806 --> 02:20:56.411]  A tornado is an easy to install, maintenance free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:20:56.711 --> 02:21:03.797]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[02:21:03.937 --> 02:21:08.721]  With today's gas prices it makes sense to cage the gas saving power of a tornado.
[02:21:08.901 --> 02:21:14.426]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your tornado at Checkers, Shucks and Cragen today!
[02:21:16.381 --> 02:21:20.142]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:21:20.382 --> 02:21:25.164]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:21:25.184 --> 02:21:26.944]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:21:27.224 --> 02:21:27.424]  No.
[02:21:27.765 --> 02:21:31.546]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:21:31.926 --> 02:21:33.286]  Are all covers the same?
[02:21:33.526 --> 02:21:33.766]  No.
[02:21:34.047 --> 02:21:37.728]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:38.128 --> 02:21:40.248]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:21:40.529 --> 02:21:43.049]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[02:21:43.329 --> 02:21:45.110]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:58.223 --> 02:22:03.207]  Let's continue with wide open thumbs at 800-259-9231.
[02:22:03.768 --> 02:22:06.110]  Tommy in Tennessee, you're on Genesis, go ahead.
[02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:07.751]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:22:07.931 --> 02:22:08.612]  Good, sir.
[02:22:08.752 --> 02:22:14.177]  Listen, I got on with Laura England yesterday because they were talking about... Oh, the ultra-liberals?
[02:22:14.197 --> 02:22:14.577]  Sure, yeah.
[02:22:14.797 --> 02:22:15.538]  Oh, I'm telling you.
[02:22:15.998 --> 02:22:19.501]  And they were talking about the troops that killed those innocent people over there.
[02:22:19.882 --> 02:22:23.765]  And I presented her with so many facts about Darjahmal and things like that.
[02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:29.010]  And, uh, she started, uh, asking, you know, saying, how dare you, you know, criticize the military?
[02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:52.616]  I said, well, it's a small faction of it, yes, but I started presenting facts like, uh, well, then tell me, she started calling me a conspiracy kook, and I said, well, tell me how come you, Rudolph Giuliani, got warned 15 minutes before the, uh, buildings came down, and they started playing the, um, the Twilight Zone music on me, and just, and I, and I got in PrisonPlan.com several times, and even after the call, they kept saying PrisonPlan.com, PrisonPlan, so... And they were being sarcastic?
[02:22:53.291 --> 02:23:00.255]  Well, yes they were, but they were saying PrisonPlanet.com and I said, why don't you have a real debate and why don't you get Alex Jones on your show?
[02:23:00.695 --> 02:23:03.297]  And they said, oh yeah, we're on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:23:03.357 --> 02:23:04.898]  One of her producers was on the website.
[02:23:04.938 --> 02:23:06.018]  Oh, we're looking at it right now.
[02:23:06.038 --> 02:23:09.480]  I was turning the planet into a prison, you know, joking about it.
[02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:10.901]  But the name got out there.
[02:23:12.481 --> 02:23:23.331]  I think everyone should email her website and just bombard her with facts and things to overwhelm her, because they cannot endure... Well, Laura Ingraham can't fight her way out of a paper bag.
[02:23:23.351 --> 02:23:24.953]  She's got about three brain cells.
[02:23:25.333 --> 02:23:28.176]  I mean, I hear these, but see, it's a sophomoric look.
[02:23:28.616 --> 02:23:30.757]  The liberals want to destroy America.
[02:23:30.797 --> 02:23:32.719]  They've got to oppose us conservatives to do it.
[02:23:33.059 --> 02:23:33.979]  And it's not going to work.
[02:23:33.999 --> 02:23:35.420]  We're going to expose the open borders.
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:37.201]  We're going to expose the gun control.
[02:23:37.221 --> 02:23:40.723]  We're going to expose Bush and his Pan-American Union plans.
[02:23:41.263 --> 02:23:43.505]  And none of them are going to be able to stop it.
[02:23:44.045 --> 02:23:47.207]  The Bible says that time will come when they will not endorse sound doctrine.
[02:23:47.267 --> 02:23:50.329]  And they couldn't endorse sound doctrine on their best day if they tried.
[02:23:50.409 --> 02:23:53.911]  I mean, they're just so wrapped up in their own
[02:23:55.263 --> 02:24:01.426]  I know Fox News attacked Mirtha for saying the troops killing these innocent people is wrong.
[02:24:01.866 --> 02:24:04.348]  I mean, the Marine Corps Commandant has said it's horrible.
[02:24:04.708 --> 02:24:05.688]  They've got to admit it.
[02:24:05.708 --> 02:24:10.171]  I mean, by them saying it's okay, it makes the whole military look bad.
[02:24:10.491 --> 02:24:12.352]  They're the ones making the military look bad.
[02:24:12.572 --> 02:24:18.315]  If the military immediately punished people that did stuff like that, then they couldn't get away with it, thanks for the call.
[02:24:18.895 --> 02:24:22.717]  They're the ones making the military look bad, which is part of their plan globally.
[02:24:22.737 --> 02:24:23.017]  By the way,
[02:24:23.692 --> 02:24:25.153]  The torture was let out on purpose.
[02:24:25.173 --> 02:24:25.853]  I hope you know that.
[02:24:26.374 --> 02:24:28.875]  All this is being allowed on purpose to demonize America.
[02:24:28.915 --> 02:24:29.896]  The globalists are doing it.
[02:24:29.936 --> 02:24:30.616]  It's all staged.
[02:24:32.157 --> 02:24:33.678]  Let's go ahead and look.
[02:24:34.139 --> 02:24:34.899]  I know Murdoch.
[02:24:34.939 --> 02:24:37.761]  He owns British papers where he attacks us and lets the truth come out.
[02:24:38.081 --> 02:24:39.062]  Then here it's different.
[02:24:39.082 --> 02:24:40.582]  See, it's all part of a global plan.
[02:24:40.943 --> 02:24:42.624]  Different propaganda in different areas.
[02:24:43.564 --> 02:24:45.125]  Let's talk to Matt in Mississippi.
[02:24:45.165 --> 02:24:45.826]  Matt, go ahead.
[02:24:46.306 --> 02:24:46.646]  Hey, Alex.
[02:24:46.846 --> 02:24:48.507]  You get many calls here in Mississippi?
[02:24:48.908 --> 02:24:49.188]  Some.
[02:24:49.968 --> 02:24:50.268]  Okay.
[02:24:50.689 --> 02:24:52.350]  Well, you know, I feel like I'm the only
[02:24:53.109 --> 02:24:56.391]  Info Warrior out here who's on board with the truth.
[02:24:57.191 --> 02:24:59.252]  But hey, I'm coming out to L.A.
[02:24:59.672 --> 02:25:03.694]  and I'm very excited to go out there and be a part.
[02:25:03.734 --> 02:25:07.176]  Well, I'm glad people from all over are coming in, so this is going to be great.
[02:25:07.836 --> 02:25:12.499]  Hey, I just wanted to make a quick plug, if I can, like for all the people who are going to L.A.
[02:25:12.559 --> 02:25:14.400]  by themselves, like myself.
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:17.101]  I've started a group on MySpace.
[02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:19.782]  It's all right if I go ahead and give the way.
[02:25:19.802 --> 02:25:20.282]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:25:20.302 --> 02:25:21.003]  Give us your MySpace.
[02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:29.155]  Okay, it is groups.myspace.com forward slash 911symposium.
[02:25:29.615 --> 02:25:30.095]  Oh, great!
[02:25:30.535 --> 02:25:37.019]  Yeah, and this, you know, gives a link to the actual American Scholar Symposium website as well.
[02:25:37.919 --> 02:25:42.381]  And we'll just give everyone an opportunity to, you know, I guess, meet each other before you go out.
[02:25:43.342 --> 02:25:49.104]  Well, the buzz on this, I mean, I've really only been promoting it through this radio show, and it's filling up quick.
[02:25:49.144 --> 02:25:50.025]  The buzz is huge.
[02:25:51.537 --> 02:25:55.181]  Definitely, and you don't understand how excited I am.
[02:25:55.841 --> 02:26:04.129]  But one thing, I heard you guys talking a little bit earlier about public access and broadcasting, I guess, your movies.
[02:26:04.522 --> 02:26:06.323]  How complicated is that actually?
[02:26:06.403 --> 02:26:08.644]  It depends on the facility.
[02:26:08.664 --> 02:26:11.205]  Some facilities you just come in and give them the tapes and they air them.
[02:26:11.645 --> 02:26:20.730]  Others you go sign up, take a class or two that takes a few nights, pay a small fee, 50 bucks, and then you can do your own live show or air all the tapes you want, have your own slot every week.
[02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:24.272]  That's what's really effective, but just bringing the tapes down is good too.
[02:26:24.952 --> 02:26:26.993]  Awesome, so you do grant permission to do that?
[02:26:27.532 --> 02:26:33.617]  Yeah, actually my film, The Takeover, says at the end, part of the solutions is to do that and I've authorized it.
[02:26:33.637 --> 02:26:38.641]  The form is somewhere on my website, but if they ask you to fill out a form, just fill it out and say you've got permission.
[02:26:39.442 --> 02:26:39.722]  Awesome.
[02:26:39.742 --> 02:26:41.583]  Hey Alex, my pleasure to speak with you.
[02:26:42.084 --> 02:26:43.005]  Hey, good talking to you.
[02:26:43.045 --> 02:26:46.988]  Can't wait to shake your hand out in Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th.
[02:26:47.368 --> 02:26:48.909]  Man, the tickets are selling fast, folks.
[02:26:48.929 --> 02:26:49.570]  You better get them.
[02:26:50.311 --> 02:26:52.472]  I mean, they are really starting to sell quick now.
[02:26:53.293 --> 02:26:56.916]  And I've never had an event, except for one, that didn't sell out.
[02:26:57.927 --> 02:26:59.748]  Every other event has been overflow.
[02:27:01.169 --> 02:27:08.514]  I showed Rugged Tyranny twice in Houston and one time didn't even really promote it and we had like 80 something percent filled in a like 400 seat theater.
[02:27:09.074 --> 02:27:22.583]  But this thing, it seats a thousand and we've reached the halfway point a while back and we're going to sell these tickets out quick so get your tickets at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 1-888.
[02:27:24.241 --> 02:27:24.821]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.

[02:27:36.365 --> 02:27:39.347]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.367 --> 02:27:42.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.522 --> 02:27:53.387]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.527 --> 02:28:06.456]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:06.637 --> 02:28:08.438]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:28:08.598 --> 02:28:12.061]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:28:12.342 --> 02:28:16.125]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:28:16.385 --> 02:28:21.350]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:23.332]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:28:23.592 --> 02:28:27.576]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:28:27.816 --> 02:28:29.717]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[02:28:29.837 --> 02:28:34.478]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.

[02:28:36.239 --> 02:28:36.779]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[02:28:46.559 --> 02:28:48.159]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.299 --> 02:28:52.400]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:55.421]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.501 --> 02:29:02.203]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.403 --> 02:29:05.403]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.603 --> 02:29:07.984]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:30:38.127 --> 02:30:38.527]  until 2 p.m.
[02:30:38.547 --> 02:30:39.788]  Central Standard Time.
[02:30:39.908 --> 02:30:41.148]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[02:30:59.076 --> 02:31:04.479]  I'll be hopping on a big jet aeroplane to go up to the Windy City, Chicago.
[02:31:05.419 --> 02:31:09.561]  And I'll be a keynote speaker Friday night at their big 9-11 meeting they're having.
[02:31:09.581 --> 02:31:12.703]  You can just type in 9-11 Chicago Symposium into Google.
[02:31:13.223 --> 02:31:14.664]  You'll find it if you still want to come.
[02:31:15.084 --> 02:31:23.048]  And I've got my big event again coming up June 24th and 25th in the city of Angel, Los Angeles, California.
[02:31:24.458 --> 02:31:29.521]  Yep, they say California is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly.
[02:31:29.541 --> 02:31:31.502]  Alright, I'm being really stupid.
[02:31:32.063 --> 02:31:33.383]  During the break I was singing.
[02:31:34.304 --> 02:31:37.026]  I didn't know Dave Von Kleist and Joyce Riley were out of town.
[02:31:37.066 --> 02:31:47.872]  I was telling them to call them up so I could get them to call in and play that song over the ISDN line, the Take Your Gun From My Cold Dead Hand, and he informed me that they were not there, and he said, you could just sing it yourself.
[02:31:48.948 --> 02:31:56.070]  And so I began singing the song during the break and kind of got off into that little mood, and so I added a little ensemble there for you.
[02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:59.431]  I'm being really crazy now here, folks.
[02:32:00.231 --> 02:32:02.652]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:32:03.632 --> 02:32:05.973]  Let's talk to Keith in Indiana.
[02:32:05.993 --> 02:32:06.873]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:32:06.893 --> 02:32:07.873]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:07.953 --> 02:32:08.713]  I got a cell phone.
[02:32:08.733 --> 02:32:09.434]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:32:09.514 --> 02:32:10.634]  I hear you loud and clear.
[02:32:11.194 --> 02:32:11.594]  All right.
[02:32:12.194 --> 02:32:18.176]  Well, you know, I know we have political problems and economic problems, but I'll tell you, our real problem is the churches.
[02:32:19.178 --> 02:32:27.003]  They have gone away to the right hand and the left hand and left the foundation... Oh, they teach you turn your guns in, worship world government, the UN's good, oh yeah!
[02:32:27.363 --> 02:32:28.224]  Again, the politics.
[02:32:28.264 --> 02:32:29.265]  I'm talking doctrine.
[02:32:29.825 --> 02:32:37.110]  The truth of Christianity is based on the covenant that God made with Abraham in Genesis 17 and the rest of the Bible is based exactly on that promise.
[02:32:37.230 --> 02:32:39.131]  And they won't teach that simple truth anymore.
[02:32:40.032 --> 02:32:41.953]  Because it divides the families of the earth.
[02:32:42.413 --> 02:32:43.914]  Well, it's the fundamental assumptions.
[02:32:44.395 --> 02:32:47.316]  They think that all the families of the earth are descended from one family.
[02:32:47.757 --> 02:32:47.957]  Adam.
[02:32:48.871 --> 02:32:49.431]  That's a lie!
[02:32:49.451 --> 02:32:52.592]  If you look up the name Adam, it means to show blood in the face.
[02:32:52.652 --> 02:32:53.972]  It's 120 and strong.
[02:32:54.112 --> 02:32:54.913]  It's from 119.
[02:32:55.493 --> 02:32:56.053]  Ruddy man.
[02:32:56.753 --> 02:33:00.854]  Now, when this country was founded, we were 99.9% pure Israelite.
[02:33:01.454 --> 02:33:03.995]  So the Germans and English and that, they didn't know who they were.
[02:33:04.015 --> 02:33:09.976]  You know, it's been blindness in part has happened under Israel to the fullness of the nations come in.
[02:33:11.057 --> 02:33:14.357]  What's going on behind and deeper is the Balaam Plan.
[02:33:15.038 --> 02:33:15.478]  Numbers 25 to 31.
[02:33:17.711 --> 02:33:18.732]  The mixing of the seed.
[02:33:19.333 --> 02:33:20.213]  That's what Esau did.
[02:33:20.233 --> 02:33:23.376]  He married the daughters of Heth, the Hittites.
[02:33:24.037 --> 02:33:30.543]  Now the Hittites, really, the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe are Hittites, and another mixture, Turkish Mongols.
[02:33:31.824 --> 02:33:32.705]  They are not Israel.
[02:33:33.105 --> 02:33:37.329]  They named their mini-state Israel, to deceive everybody, but they are not Israel.
[02:33:38.775 --> 02:33:39.735]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[02:33:39.775 --> 02:33:49.079]  How do the Christian identity folks square it with the Merovingians, the French bloodline that claims they're descendant of Mary Magdalene, and that kind of gets into the whole New Age thing.
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:56.383]  It's funny, the New Agers, for thousands of years, have been saying they're really the royal bloodline of David, that Christ comes from.
[02:33:56.403 --> 02:33:59.564]  And then you have the royal Israelites, which is what our modern
[02:34:00.473 --> 02:34:10.922]  Most, of course, even Christian identity people don't know this, but the Queen of England is coronated supposedly on the stone of Abraham, where he was about to sacrifice.
[02:34:11.482 --> 02:34:13.224]  Jacob's stone, the blue stone, whatever.
[02:34:14.304 --> 02:34:29.077]  So all of this goes on, and then I see it again, and there is a lot of evidence that some of the twelve tribes did migrate into Europe, and there was intermixing, but are you saying that there weren't Germanic tribes
[02:34:29.697 --> 02:34:35.942]  Thousands of years before there was anything called an Israelite in places like England and other areas?
[02:34:36.282 --> 02:34:37.143]  Alright, alright.
[02:34:37.163 --> 02:34:38.184]  First let me say this too.
[02:34:38.244 --> 02:34:47.411]  On 60 Minutes about a dozen years ago, they did about 10 minutes show on how the royal monarchies of Europe can trace their origin back to the Royal House of David.
[02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:48.552]  Which is true!
[02:34:49.494 --> 02:34:50.955]  Now, usually kings rule over their own.
[02:34:50.975 --> 02:34:51.755]  Well, I mean, I know this.
[02:34:51.835 --> 02:34:52.676]  I know they say that.
[02:34:53.296 --> 02:34:56.077]  But I'm saying, I mean, how do you square that?
[02:34:56.137 --> 02:34:58.519]  Because, let me finish.
[02:34:58.559 --> 02:35:04.882]  The Christian Identity crowd says that, you know, that really they're all secretly, you know, devils or something.
[02:35:05.862 --> 02:35:10.765]  Well, the thing about it is, this is hard to do in just a couple minutes, but I'll give it my best.
[02:35:10.865 --> 02:35:12.726]  I got to, because I said I was going to do a lot of calls.
[02:35:13.126 --> 02:35:17.528]  Alright, the history of Israel, you know, the ten northern tribes were divorced from God and cut off.
[02:35:17.869 --> 02:35:18.529]  They were scattered.
[02:35:19.013 --> 02:35:23.357]  Most of true Israel was not even in the Promised Land at the time Christ walked on the earth.
[02:35:23.477 --> 02:35:24.998]  They were already scattered all over Europe.
[02:35:25.979 --> 02:35:29.162]  You know, you've got to look at where the Trojans came from, probably the Zerah branch.
[02:35:29.222 --> 02:35:32.044]  A lot of people migrated out of Israel before the Exodus, even.
[02:35:32.485 --> 02:35:35.888]  Well, we do know, with the archaeological record, there were a lot of Greeks.
[02:35:37.009 --> 02:35:46.117]  And people always think that the tribe of Judah and others, and then David, they thought that they were busy fighting
[02:35:47.451 --> 02:35:58.399]  with what are Arabs today, but really, they say that most archaeological evidence shows that the tribes that they call the Philistines were really Greek.
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:16.752]  Well, yeah, well, no, well, the Greeks named, gave the name Phoenician, side and side, that's a slightly different, here's the main thing where they get lost in the history of Israel, is these divorced tribes, when Christ died, the husband died, he can remarry his bride again.
[02:36:17.287 --> 02:36:20.910]  Paul was preaching to Gentiles, that's true, but they were particular Gentiles.
[02:36:21.390 --> 02:36:26.394]  They were heathen nations who had been part of Israel, who were divorced from Israel, and now were included in Israel again.
[02:36:26.814 --> 02:36:27.975]  Read that in Hosea 1.
[02:36:28.075 --> 02:36:30.377]  So black people were going to go to hell, basically?
[02:36:30.397 --> 02:36:30.477]  No!
[02:36:30.497 --> 02:36:31.538]  See, everybody goes there.
[02:36:31.578 --> 02:36:32.318]  That's not true.
[02:36:32.358 --> 02:36:33.719]  They're not even the guilty party.
[02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:35.401]  Adam's the guilty party.
[02:36:36.061 --> 02:36:36.722]  Adam fell.
[02:36:37.262 --> 02:36:40.704]  You could do an easy proof to show that Adam's original form was immortal.
[02:36:41.005 --> 02:36:42.386]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:36:42.466 --> 02:36:45.388]  I can't... I've given you... Sorry, I've got to let you go.
[02:36:45.428 --> 02:36:46.008]  I've got to let you go.
[02:36:47.449 --> 02:36:48.310]  Seven minutes.
[02:36:49.010 --> 02:36:49.290]  No, no.
[02:36:49.450 --> 02:36:49.990]  Six minutes.
[02:36:50.311 --> 02:36:50.791]  I gotta go.
[02:36:50.831 --> 02:36:51.791]  That's not fair to others.
[02:36:52.312 --> 02:36:53.552]  I said I'm taking a lot of calls.
[02:36:53.632 --> 02:36:55.213]  Most days, a lot of people go on for ten minutes.
[02:36:56.514 --> 02:36:57.755]  And then I get criticized.
[02:36:57.775 --> 02:36:58.975]  Well, you don't let them talk.
[02:36:59.075 --> 02:36:59.456]  No, no.
[02:36:59.936 --> 02:37:03.138]  If we don't go to other people, we can't get to all the calls.
[02:37:04.138 --> 02:37:07.420]  Let's go ahead and... I've got my call list screwed up now.
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:11.202]  Sheo, or something like Skeo, in Pennsylvania.
[02:37:11.222 --> 02:37:11.883]  You're on the air.
[02:37:11.923 --> 02:37:12.243]  Welcome.
[02:37:12.683 --> 02:37:13.083]  Thank you.
[02:37:13.483 --> 02:37:14.144]  It's Skeo.
[02:37:15.384 --> 02:37:16.245]  I've called in before.
[02:37:17.746 --> 02:37:20.187]  Are you aware that the government's bankrupt?
[02:37:21.388 --> 02:37:24.911]  By design, the Federal Reserve has done that.
[02:37:25.411 --> 02:37:25.611]  Right.
[02:37:26.172 --> 02:37:29.154]  I have a part of the Congressional record right here.
[02:37:29.174 --> 02:37:37.400]  On March 17, 1993, Congressman James Traffickin stated in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, we are now here in Chapter 11.
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:41.743]  Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization
[02:37:43.966 --> 02:37:53.434]  It goes on to state, but I know that you gotta hurry, but I just wanted to touch upon one thing.
[02:37:53.995 --> 02:38:03.984]  If we look at the 14th Amendment and how it's worded, and how it gives power to the corporations, and makes all the sovereign citizens actually U.S.
[02:38:04.044 --> 02:38:08.868]  citizens, which takes me back to my battle with domestic relations.
[02:38:09.426 --> 02:38:12.450]  I've figured out what domestic relations program's all about.
[02:38:12.951 --> 02:38:20.661]  It's about using our offspring, using our offspring to generate money for the social security program because the United States government is paying for it.
[02:38:20.681 --> 02:38:22.303]  No, I hear you and I appreciate the call.
[02:38:22.803 --> 02:38:23.925]  Look, it boils down to this.
[02:38:24.466 --> 02:38:25.907]  It goes back further than that, sir.
[02:38:26.648 --> 02:38:27.790]  The 14th Amendment
[02:38:28.763 --> 02:38:29.223]  We're good to go.
[02:38:49.637 --> 02:38:51.519]  We've all been made wards of the state.
[02:38:51.579 --> 02:38:52.159]  It's official.
[02:38:52.479 --> 02:38:54.661]  They weren't about to free black people, folks.
[02:38:55.121 --> 02:39:00.025]  And so what they did is they said, we'll make them basically wards, and then everybody else will be wards.
[02:39:00.506 --> 02:39:03.208]  And then now we've gone under total globalist control.
[02:39:03.768 --> 02:39:09.072]  And so, yes, we are actually publicly pledged, this is mainstream news, to the national debt.
[02:39:09.152 --> 02:39:11.954]  We are seen and called slaves.
[02:39:12.255 --> 02:39:13.736]  Zygmunt Brzezinski calls us slaves.
[02:39:15.248 --> 02:39:17.630]  National Security Advisor, founder of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:20.892]  They actually have public meetings and write books and call us dumb slaves.
[02:39:21.073 --> 02:39:22.934]  Because they know dumb slaves don't read the books they write.
[02:39:24.255 --> 02:39:27.097]  Let's go ahead and... It's really sick, isn't it?
[02:39:27.818 --> 02:39:28.678]  Good points, caller.
[02:39:28.738 --> 02:39:29.339]  I've just got to go.
[02:39:29.399 --> 02:39:34.023]  I've said I'm taking 20 calls by the end of this show.
[02:39:34.043 --> 02:39:34.383]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:39:34.903 --> 02:39:36.585]  As the lines become open, you can call in.
[02:39:36.985 --> 02:39:38.466]  Cliff in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:39:38.526 --> 02:39:38.926]  Go ahead.
[02:39:38.946 --> 02:39:40.267]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:39:40.648 --> 02:39:40.868]  Hi.
[02:39:41.308 --> 02:39:44.811]  I'd like to talk to you about the draft bill.
[02:39:45.962 --> 02:39:58.172]  It was HR 163, and I believe that bill was defeated on October 6th of 2004 by a vote of 4-0-2-2.
[02:39:58.432 --> 02:39:59.993]  Yes, I mean, I knew the old bill number.
[02:40:00.053 --> 02:40:00.914]  It's been reintroduced.
[02:40:00.994 --> 02:40:01.794]  Oh, there's a new one?
[02:40:01.935 --> 02:40:04.737]  Each successive Congress, and I didn't have it in front of me.
[02:40:04.777 --> 02:40:06.578]  The caller was asking what the new bill number is.
[02:40:07.259 --> 02:40:07.779]  Oh, okay.
[02:40:07.859 --> 02:40:11.742]  I was wondering because HR 163 was the only one I could find.
[02:40:11.862 --> 02:40:13.784]  Yeah, no, it's like Ron Paul every year.
[02:40:14.708 --> 02:40:17.408]  Reintroduces his bill to pull us out of the U.N.?
[02:40:18.249 --> 02:40:25.510]  Well, Rangel introduces it at every Congress to bring in the draft.
[02:40:26.590 --> 02:40:36.352]  Something I found interesting about this, the only two that voted for that bill in 2003, January 7, 2003, was Pete Stark and John Murtha.
[02:40:38.172 --> 02:40:39.352]  Remember that guy?
[02:40:39.392 --> 02:40:40.833]  Yeah, Murtha's out criticizing.
[02:40:40.853 --> 02:40:42.033]  I don't think that's right.
[02:40:43.823 --> 02:40:45.604]  Let me be clear sir, I haven't looked the number up in a while.
[02:41:06.288 --> 02:41:10.630]  There are three bills introduced every session, so you may be talking about another bill altogether.
[02:41:10.911 --> 02:41:11.171]  Yeah.
[02:41:11.591 --> 02:41:17.554]  Well, the ones who introduced this one was Rangel, McDermott, Conyers-Lewis, Clark, and Abercrombie.
[02:41:17.574 --> 02:41:19.175]  Well, then that's the bill Rangel wrote.
[02:41:19.275 --> 02:41:20.635]  Why are you saying he didn't vote for it?
[02:41:22.536 --> 02:41:25.077]  Because it was defeated by 402-2.
[02:41:26.861 --> 02:41:29.962]  And the only two that did vote for it was Stark and Murphy.
[02:41:30.202 --> 02:41:32.062]  Yeah, that just means Rangel wasn't there that day.
[02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:33.582]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:34.283 --> 02:41:41.164]  Again, I'm busy taking calls, covering the news here, and there's certain issues that I feel don't even need to be re-documented.
[02:41:41.964 --> 02:41:45.905]  For the first year of the draft bills being reintroduced, it was national denial.
[02:41:46.545 --> 02:41:48.246]  There are three different pieces of legislation.
[02:41:48.306 --> 02:41:51.726]  It's been in the Houston Chronicle, it's been in the AP, it's been everywhere.
[02:41:51.766 --> 02:41:54.207]  We've interviewed Rangel about it, it's been all over national TV.
[02:41:55.151 --> 02:41:57.236]  And they've reset up the draft boards.
[02:41:58.359 --> 02:41:59.782]  They admit they need one.
[02:41:59.883 --> 02:42:01.908]  And after another big attack, we're probably going to have one.
[02:42:02.435 --> 02:42:05.237]  So I can't sit here and debate the fact that there are draft bills.
[02:42:05.297 --> 02:42:09.161]  It's just true, end of story, and go look it up for yourself.
[02:42:09.561 --> 02:42:10.822]  I've got a computer right here.
[02:42:10.842 --> 02:42:12.143]  It's not even turned on.
[02:42:12.183 --> 02:42:16.146]  It's about to be loaded in my camera, in my bag to be taken, and calls.
[02:42:16.247 --> 02:42:16.767]  I don't even know.
[02:42:17.167 --> 02:42:19.990]  Thank you for the bill number, sir, but I don't understand what you're saying.
[02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:22.832]  If Rangel introduces a bill, I would imagine he voted on it.
[02:42:23.272 --> 02:42:24.053]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:42:24.513 --> 02:42:25.614]  We all know it didn't pass.
[02:42:25.674 --> 02:42:26.555]  I never said it passed.
[02:42:27.296 --> 02:42:27.616]  Okay.
[02:42:28.135 --> 02:42:29.816]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:29.876 --> 02:42:32.899]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gene in Hawaii.
[02:42:32.919 --> 02:42:33.619]  You're on the air.
[02:42:33.679 --> 02:42:34.119]  Go ahead.
[02:42:34.139 --> 02:42:35.841]  Aloha, Alex.
[02:42:35.861 --> 02:42:36.461]  Good afternoon.
[02:42:36.681 --> 02:42:37.502]  Good morning for us.
[02:42:37.922 --> 02:42:38.162]  Yeah.
[02:42:38.282 --> 02:42:43.486]  Anyways, I just had a question about Congress convening Sina Dea.
[02:42:44.767 --> 02:42:47.789]  That during the Civil War, or after the Civil War?
[02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.450]  Yes.
[02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:53.674]  And how that it was adjourned without day and reconvened without day.
[02:42:53.694 --> 02:42:55.395]  Does that have any significance on the
[02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:59.171]  Legitimacy of the Congress today?
[02:42:59.652 --> 02:43:01.513]  Well, I mean, here's an example of state government.
[02:43:02.093 --> 02:43:14.319]  Twice, once with cannons, Texans threw the appointed Republican governors out of the Capitol just a few miles from where I sit.
[02:43:14.899 --> 02:43:16.160]  The Capitol's right in front of me.
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:19.742]  And I can walk outside and go down the block and look at it.
[02:43:20.642 --> 02:43:22.563]  And they don't teach that in Texas history.
[02:43:22.583 --> 02:43:23.824]  Can you imagine teaching them?
[02:43:24.588 --> 02:43:26.190]  That I had ancestors, by the way.
[02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:31.074]  I mean, thousands of Texans converged on Austin twice and threw out appointed governors.
[02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:33.196]  And it was the same thing federally.
[02:43:33.596 --> 02:43:35.338]  Lincoln even arrested members of Congress.
[02:43:36.259 --> 02:43:37.560]  Hundreds of newspaper editors.
[02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:40.122]  Governors on house arrest.
[02:43:41.043 --> 02:43:48.670]  And yes, ever since the Civil War, whether you love what happened or hate what happened, the point is, federal control spiraled out of
[02:43:50.333 --> 02:43:56.158]  I really appreciated that uh... uh... thing that you were doing on uh... what was it Jackson or Johnson that uh... he said that he uh... killed the bank.
[02:44:13.653 --> 02:44:14.413]  Andrew Jackson.
[02:44:14.694 --> 02:44:16.475]  Yeah, and that was kind of interesting.
[02:44:16.515 --> 02:44:21.117]  And I'm looking also at the bankruptcy of the United States.
[02:44:21.177 --> 02:44:22.758]  What was that, 1933?
[02:44:24.198 --> 02:44:24.779]  Yes.
[02:44:26.099 --> 02:44:30.361]  And how that they're trying to discover the assets of the creditors, which is you and me.
[02:44:30.381 --> 02:44:32.543]  And we reside within the state.
[02:44:32.583 --> 02:44:35.284]  We don't really reside within the federal government.
[02:44:35.862 --> 02:44:45.331]  Yeah, we're a union of confederated states who limitedly are in a partnership with the National Defense to control the borders and to levy tariffs on foreign goods.
[02:44:46.131 --> 02:44:53.198]  And that has been superseded by the Federalists, who literally, in some cases, were just shot out of hand in New York.
[02:44:54.179 --> 02:44:56.521]  Burr blasted Alexander Hamilton.
[02:44:57.021 --> 02:45:00.004]  And then by the time of Lincoln in 1913, the super-Federalists took over.
[02:45:03.228 --> 02:45:05.949]  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm coming up on right now.
[02:45:06.829 --> 02:45:13.312]  And we're looking at some other things that... The arch treasurer of the United States is actually the Crown of England.
[02:45:14.432 --> 02:45:15.613]  Well, that's what I've done.
[02:45:15.653 --> 02:45:20.274]  I mean, I've looked at the research, and the British own more of this country than anybody else, and that's just the cold hard numbers.
[02:45:20.815 --> 02:45:27.037]  People can say it's the Catholics, or it's the Tooth Fairy, or it's the Jews, you know, and then Balkanize everybody.
[02:45:27.137 --> 02:45:30.118]  I'm sorry, the biggest owners are British royalty.
[02:45:30.518 --> 02:45:31.499]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:31.839 --> 02:45:32.459]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:33.069 --> 02:45:35.539]  She's also considered the defender of the faith.
[02:45:37.307 --> 02:45:37.528]  Yes.
[02:45:39.891 --> 02:45:40.951]  King James 1611.
[02:45:41.492 --> 02:45:42.632]  Yes, I appreciate the call.
[02:45:42.672 --> 02:45:44.712]  I gotta move on here.
[02:45:44.752 --> 02:45:45.873]  That's how you were able to get on.
[02:45:45.893 --> 02:45:46.993]  I hate having to move on.
[02:45:47.013 --> 02:45:47.893]  It's just that we don't do that.
[02:45:48.494 --> 02:45:49.494]  We won't be able to talk to folks.
[02:45:49.514 --> 02:45:50.674]  Good to hear from you from Hawaii.
[02:45:50.714 --> 02:45:52.255]  Call back on the day when I'm taking long calls.
[02:45:52.695 --> 02:45:54.435]  Let's talk to Russell in Florida.
[02:45:54.475 --> 02:45:55.235]  Russell, go ahead.
[02:45:55.416 --> 02:45:56.616]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:45:56.836 --> 02:45:57.056]  Hi.
[02:45:57.356 --> 02:46:03.078]  Alex, are you familiar with a new documentary that just came out by Valerie Mee and Don Richards called Voices of Patriots?
[02:46:03.798 --> 02:46:04.138]  No.
[02:46:04.658 --> 02:46:07.479]  Okay, since Dr. Bowman was on your
[02:46:08.482 --> 02:46:15.648]  Since he was on your radio show, and you interviewed him, I've built a pretty decent relationship with him.
[02:46:15.709 --> 02:46:17.270]  I've given him a lot of your information.
[02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:18.912]  He's going to be at our 9-11 event?
[02:46:19.092 --> 02:46:20.033]  Yes.
[02:46:20.293 --> 02:46:24.857]  He gave me this documentary that he is in, as well as a few other experts.
[02:46:25.398 --> 02:46:26.519]  I'm going to send you a copy.
[02:46:26.539 --> 02:46:28.361]  It's 28 minutes long.
[02:46:30.393 --> 02:46:34.055]  Possibly you can get them to post it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:46:34.115 --> 02:46:39.737]  Yeah, in fact, get them to agree to it and add a letter from them in with it and I won't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:46:40.137 --> 02:46:40.578]  I'll do it.
[02:46:40.638 --> 02:46:41.258]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:41.298 --> 02:46:42.258]  I'm moving fast now.
[02:46:42.779 --> 02:46:44.279]  Andrew in Winnipeg, Canada.
[02:46:44.299 --> 02:46:44.920]  You're on the air.
[02:46:44.980 --> 02:46:45.320]  Welcome.
[02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:46.720]  Hi Alex.
[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:49.562]  I just want to say thanks for everything you're doing for us.
[02:46:50.002 --> 02:46:50.442]  Thank you.
[02:46:50.462 --> 02:46:52.963]  There's not too many people like you in the world.
[02:46:53.043 --> 02:46:55.304]  It seems like it's only you.
[02:46:55.324 --> 02:46:56.305]  There's lots of us.
[02:46:56.345 --> 02:46:57.205]  There's people like you.
[02:46:57.285 --> 02:46:59.066]  It's just most of us don't have voices.
[02:47:00.127 --> 02:47:00.728]  Exactly.
[02:47:01.848 --> 02:47:07.692]  What I want to talk about is actually like a loose change video compared to your 9-1-1 road to Turing video.
[02:47:07.752 --> 02:47:07.832]  Yes.
[02:47:08.312 --> 02:47:29.325]  Everyone talks about loose change, loose change, but what I don't really like about it, it focuses too much on the speculative stuff like the flash before it hits the Twin Towers, the missed solar plane that hits the Pentagon, and you deal in facts and people should focus on your videos because it's more on the facts more than speculation and then the
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:43.246]  Well, I mean, I think Loose Change 2 is excellent.
[02:47:43.266 --> 02:47:44.166]  I didn't carry Loose Change 1.
[02:47:44.406 --> 02:47:45.207]  Loose Change 2 is better.
[02:47:45.227 --> 02:47:46.347]  You might want to get a copy of that.
[02:47:47.087 --> 02:47:52.070]  I've seen that one, too, but it still has the speculative stuff in it.
[02:47:52.090 --> 02:47:52.790]  Well, no, I mean, I hear you.
[02:47:52.970 --> 02:47:54.951]  In fact, I appreciate you commending Road to Tyranny.
[02:47:55.711 --> 02:47:56.952]  Have you seen Martial Law?
[02:47:57.812 --> 02:47:58.653]  Yes, I saw that.
[02:47:58.713 --> 02:47:59.513]  I love that one, too.
[02:48:00.953 --> 02:48:12.197]  But like your Road to Tyranny is my favorite because it shows the past, like with Oklahoma in 1993, and it links it all together.
[02:48:12.397 --> 02:48:15.758]  Yeah, we found that to be one of our, in fact, that's people's favorite video.
[02:48:15.838 --> 02:48:19.879]  I like Martial Law just because it's slicker, newer, got better camera work in it.
[02:48:20.459 --> 02:48:22.480]  But Road to Tyranny is a tour de force.
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:23.440]  I appreciate your plug.
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:24.181]  Good to hear from you.
[02:48:24.721 --> 02:48:25.761]  We'll come back and listen.
[02:48:25.801 --> 02:48:28.182]  I'm going to try to jam five calls in in five minutes.
[02:48:28.928 --> 02:48:31.450]  When we get back, we'll have exactly five minutes.
[02:48:32.371 --> 02:48:33.712]  I'm going to go right into your calls.
[02:48:33.792 --> 02:48:35.333]  I'll take five calls, maybe even more.
[02:48:35.814 --> 02:48:37.395]  So have your questions, your comments ready.
[02:48:37.995 --> 02:48:39.016]  We'll go straight into them.
[02:48:39.376 --> 02:48:43.600]  Be sure and go to Infowars.com and get those videos you heard the good man from Canada mention.
[02:48:46.212 --> 02:48:54.481]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:48:54.662 --> 02:48:57.004]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:48:57.605 --> 02:49:06.455]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag tear operation.
[02:49:06.975 --> 02:49:10.497]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[02:49:10.937 --> 02:49:19.262]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lt.
[02:49:19.322 --> 02:49:19.662]  Col.
[02:49:19.682 --> 02:49:31.729]  Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:49:32.049 --> 02:49:35.791]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:49:36.252 --> 02:49:37.475]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[02:49:46.428 --> 02:49:51.653]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.814 --> 02:49:59.902]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.162 --> 02:50:07.209]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.389 --> 02:50:08.649]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:08.749 --> 02:50:14.651]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.831 --> 02:50:19.912]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:20.032 --> 02:50:28.895]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:29.175 --> 02:50:36.037]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:15.602]  Let's take five calls right now.
[02:52:16.102 --> 02:52:17.803]  Jim in New York, you're on the air.
[02:52:18.624 --> 02:52:19.264]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:52:19.865 --> 02:52:20.105]  Hello.
[02:52:20.683 --> 02:52:22.844]  Hi Alex, real quick, I may need to call back.
[02:52:22.904 --> 02:52:27.867]  I had a conversation over the winter with a former Russian Special Forces paratrooper.
[02:52:29.128 --> 02:52:31.689]  He works out at a local fitness center that I work out at.
[02:52:32.289 --> 02:52:37.672]  I befriended him several times and he began to tell me that he was going to be going to train in Southern California.
[02:52:37.692 --> 02:52:44.256]  He's really into yoga, which we know yoga is not really that good, but he was going to go for six weeks, come back here and open up a yogi center.
[02:52:44.976 --> 02:52:46.077]  I saw him several weeks later
[02:52:46.624 --> 02:52:55.570]  I said, hey Victor, you must be getting excited about your trip to California, and he was very disgruntled, and he said, my circumstances changed, in broken English, and I said, what do you mean?
[02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:57.951]  He said, I'm no longer going, my circumstances changed.
[02:52:58.572 --> 02:53:08.938]  And I just wanted, my question was, the NATO forces that are here, I just believe that maybe something may be coming down relatively soon, in the next six months, because... There are pre-deployed foreign armies, all big countries do that.
[02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:11.160]  Stay behind networks, thanks for the call.
[02:53:12.396 --> 02:53:17.679]  All right, Jeff just hung up, so next up will be Jason in Texas.
[02:53:17.719 --> 02:53:18.539]  Jason, go ahead.
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:19.540]  How you doing?
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:22.501]  A long-time watcher and a listener, first-time caller.
[02:53:22.541 --> 02:53:27.684]  I just wanted to get some information out to you about problem-reaction solution, how the government and the globalists do this.
[02:53:28.724 --> 02:53:29.325]  Four things.
[02:53:29.425 --> 02:53:30.425]  One of them personally happened to me.
[02:53:30.465 --> 02:53:34.888]  You've got March 24th, the Fidelity Lab Talk that serves identity theft in Reuters.
[02:53:34.948 --> 02:53:39.570]  You've got April 29th, my personal company, Union Pacific.
[02:53:39.963 --> 02:53:41.744]  They lose names and social security numbers.
[02:53:41.844 --> 02:53:43.025]  It happened again with the VA.
[02:53:43.045 --> 02:53:43.865]  We all know about that.
[02:53:44.666 --> 02:53:49.768]  And it also happened with today, our ABC affiliate here in Fort Worth, WSAA.
[02:53:49.788 --> 02:53:54.871]  1.3 million students lost their identity and their social security numbers.
[02:53:54.891 --> 02:53:57.413]  And that's just a cover for the government to do that.
[02:53:57.453 --> 02:54:00.334]  Yeah, but that's how you get an identity theft.
[02:54:01.135 --> 02:54:04.837]  That's how you can promote these national ID thefts and eventually, you know,
[02:54:05.425 --> 02:54:09.808]  Oh, there's no doubt that most of the big identity theft problems are not the internet as they blame it.
[02:54:10.228 --> 02:54:12.710]  Eighty plus percent is the government transactions.
[02:54:13.370 --> 02:54:21.415]  Well, and through one of these stories, Alex, it's the same thing, not only the same cover story, name, social security numbers, and also that an employee is the one that accidentally lost it.
[02:54:21.835 --> 02:54:27.819]  You know, it's blatant disinformation, and people need to know that, hey, it's a problem or action solution.
[02:54:27.839 --> 02:54:34.103]  Well, Texas claimed that when they sold all of our digital photos to the Secret Service, what, six years ago?
[02:54:34.764 --> 02:54:35.144]  Yeah.
[02:54:35.624 --> 02:54:36.845]  I know, they're a pack of crooks.
[02:54:36.905 --> 02:54:37.845]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:38.346 --> 02:54:39.766]  Good to hear from you there, Jason.
[02:54:39.826 --> 02:54:41.387]  Robert in San Diego.
[02:54:41.427 --> 02:54:41.847]  Go ahead.
[02:54:42.428 --> 02:54:42.868]  Hi Alex.
[02:54:43.008 --> 02:54:43.168]  Hi.
[02:54:43.188 --> 02:54:44.429]  I've called a few times.
[02:54:45.169 --> 02:54:52.172]  Last Friday after this fake terror drill slash distraction, CNN did a report about the TSA.
[02:54:52.673 --> 02:55:00.196]  First they accused TSA of having lax security because CNN taped some supervisors circumventing any kind of screening to go in and out of the airport.
[02:55:00.636 --> 02:55:04.178]  Then later it runs another story about how TSA has logged
[02:55:04.796 --> 02:55:06.116]  TSA badges and uniforms.
[02:55:06.397 --> 02:55:15.339]  So after establishing you can get through the security, which is the badge and uniform, boom, the new terror alert is, look out, people are out there with badges and uniforms and can get through security.
[02:55:15.619 --> 02:55:18.440]  And then they'll blame it on Iran, of course.
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:22.261]  Oh yeah, they're creating lots of plausible deniability out there.
[02:55:22.301 --> 02:55:24.922]  Believe me, if the government didn't want you to know about it, they wouldn't be covering it.
[02:55:25.702 --> 02:55:31.544]  And one quick other thing is next month they're going ahead with making all the electrical wiring carry the RF signals.
[02:55:32.128 --> 02:55:34.489]  For the ultimate electronic safety cage.
[02:55:34.769 --> 02:55:35.749]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[02:55:35.789 --> 02:55:36.449]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:36.529 --> 02:55:38.010]  Paul in Ontario, Canada.
[02:55:38.850 --> 02:55:39.530]  You're on the air.
[02:55:39.550 --> 02:55:40.470]  Are you in Ottawa?
[02:55:41.171 --> 02:55:41.691]  Uh, yeah, hey.
[02:55:42.331 --> 02:55:42.551]  Hi.
[02:55:42.631 --> 02:55:42.751]  Alex?
[02:55:43.171 --> 02:55:43.411]  Yes.
[02:55:43.471 --> 02:55:45.032]  Hi, I heard you were coming up here.
[02:55:45.052 --> 02:55:48.893]  I was wondering if you were going to be making any speeches or you're just reporting on Bilderberg.
[02:55:49.992 --> 02:55:52.414]  I'm going to be running around reporting on Bilderberg, my friend.
[02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:53.475]  Oh, that's cool.
[02:55:53.595 --> 02:55:59.860]  And also, I listened to Prison Planet TV, and you had some great interviews with David Icke and the 100 Monkey Syndrome.
[02:56:00.221 --> 02:56:00.361]  Yes.
[02:56:00.381 --> 02:56:06.766]  I'm wondering if you'll have him back on any time to really put to rest that old reptilian foolishness, because I think that really discredits him.
[02:56:06.806 --> 02:56:07.607]  Yeah, I might do that.
[02:56:07.667 --> 02:56:08.588]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:56:09.168 --> 02:56:09.909]  I'm out of time.
[02:56:09.949 --> 02:56:11.110]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:11.130 --> 02:56:12.310]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:12.751 --> 02:56:14.632]  I'm going to Chicago.
[02:56:15.132 --> 02:56:18.735]  Next week, I'm going up to Ottawa City, Ottawa to expose the Bilderbergs.
[02:56:18.755 --> 02:56:21.657]  And then the next week, it's Los Angeles.
[02:56:21.737 --> 02:56:22.777]  God bless you all.
