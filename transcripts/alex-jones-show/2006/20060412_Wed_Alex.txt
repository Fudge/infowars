[00:00:05.617 --> 00:00:06.257]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.918 --> 00:00:07.998]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:09.798]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:11.278]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:12.919]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.901]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:28.042]  Well, it feels...
[00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:38.796]  Like Monday, but no, it's really Wednesday, the 12th day of April, 2006.
[00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:40.817]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.837 --> 00:00:43.418]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:48.439]  Coming up in 30 minutes, Paul Joseph Watson will join us.
[00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:51.100]  There have been new big developments concerning the London bombing.
[00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:59.056]  And he'll also give us the latest info on the bird flu that supposedly popped up there last week.
[00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:10.283]  We'll also be talking all day about the wide open borders and how the La Reconquista is totally and completely staged and what's really behind that and why the Democrats
[00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:30.007]  And Republicans, instead of doing what the American people want and controlling our borders and kicking out all these illegal aliens that openly say they want to bring this country down, know why they're doing the opposite and trying to accelerate, trying to accelerate the third world populations pouring into this country and sinking this nation.
[00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:35.842]  Daniel Estolano will be joining us from Spain, from Madrid.
[00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:49.578]  He has been covering Bilderberg for mainstream publications the last few years and he'll try to give us his ideas on where it may be held this year and some of the things that have been on their agenda in the past and what he thinks will be on their agenda in the future.
[00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:52.141]  These are the people that run our planet.
[00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.203]  So it's extremely important you want to stay tuned with us for that.
[00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:11.177]  The websites are JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course, Marshalllaw911.info, and many, many others, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:15.623]  By the way, I'm really proud of JonesReport.com.
[00:02:15.663 --> 00:02:23.970]  We've been updating it daily now and putting a lot of 9-11 information on the site and a lot of daily breaking news as well as special reports we do.
[00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.012]  So be sure and check it out today and every day.
[00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:34.877]  I was out in California over the weekend and yesterday and I'm totally exhausted.
[00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:39.581]  A lot of important work that I was doing out there and obviously I'm never going to talk about it.
[00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:43.666]  But I just wanted to let you guys know where I was at.
[00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.709]  Well, never going to talk about it in a couple years.
[00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.411]  I'm sure you'll hear about it.
[00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.725]  But I'll just leave it at that.
[00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:53.146]  Speaking of, hear about it in a couple years.
[00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.207]  I told you a couple years ago you'd hear about it later.
[00:02:55.648 --> 00:03:01.852]  And I can tell you more and more about the powerful movie, A Scanner Darkly, that's going to be coming out in July.
[00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:16.421]  And so sometime this week I hope to have perhaps even some guests on about that and start hyping it and giving you some behind-the-scenes looks at this dystopic near-future film about a very tyrannical government.
[00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.940]  We do our best to fight the New World Order here.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.721]  We do our best to reach people through every venue.
[00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:28.382]  Film, documentaries, websites, radio, TV, print.
[00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:32.744]  We're here on the front lines fighting the New World Order 24-7.
[00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:39.166]  Out there getting converts across the political spectrum, getting more and more people to join in in the war against the globalists.
[00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:42.963]  A lot of people are shocked by the fact that we're able to have success in this tribe.
[00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:47.224]  And some people even get suspicious by the fact that we're able to have success.
[00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:54.045]  See, we're not trying to be little closeted, cloistered losers who don't win the fight against the New World Order.
[00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:56.446]  We're coming in for the big win.
[00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.846]  I'm playing this game to win.
[00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:02.587]  I'm in this fight where our lives are on the line to win.
[00:04:02.947 --> 00:04:04.687]  And I am attempting to win.
[00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:06.888]  And we have a chance to win.
[00:04:07.617 --> 00:04:09.880]  And a lot of people out there need to understand that.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.062]  That yes, we can win.
[00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:14.345]  We can win hearts and minds.
[00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:20.732]  We can win people over from inside the establishment at every level and every strata of society.
[00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:22.875]  Whatever establishment that may be.
[00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:24.877]  And we will fight until the end.
[00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.300]  And we will never surrender.
[00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:42.106]  And no matter how much COINTELPRO gets launched at us, no matter how many blogs the feds pay for, which they admit they do, no matter how much propaganda they spew in our direction, we will keep moving forward for the big win!
[00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:45.309]  So join us and come in for the big win!
[00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.871]  Be part of the big win.
[00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:50.452]  Because we're going to win.
[00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:52.354]  We've got God on our side.
[00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:53.775]  We've got courage.
[00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:55.416]  And we're the good guys.
[00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:59.098]  And we're destined to win and win big.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.743]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:10.286]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.891]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:17.794]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:22.278]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:29.265]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:31.427]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:42.093]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:47.776]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.256 --> 00:05:51.778]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.798 --> 00:05:52.198]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.339]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:10.900]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:22.390]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.435]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:35.320]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.365]  Black Berkey elements flow 1.5 to 2 times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:44.407]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.729]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.970]  Get a 2-pack for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175.
[00:06:51.312 --> 00:06:52.753]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:58.997]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:04.541]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:08.144]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:07:08.324 --> 00:07:11.746]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.313]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:20.797]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:30.463]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:07:30.603 --> 00:07:31.944]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:37.388]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:42.311]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:43.772]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:47.795]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:48.676]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:06.196]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:08.898]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.258 --> 00:08:17.464]  Alright, already into the second segment.
[00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:21.206]  I guess first segment for some stations that don't carry the first five minutes of the broadcast.
[00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:22.347]  It feels like Monday to me.
[00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:25.649]  I just got back at about 2 a.m.
[00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.951]  because of delayed flights from LAX.
[00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:28.872]  Boy, that was fun.
[00:08:30.297 --> 00:08:54.769]  into Austin Texas and I am here rip roaring ready to go just dealing with a police state I got of course to take my shoes off going through the airport not leaving Austin but coming back to Austin got to take my shoes off and got to have them search me and and then they made a comment about how my feet stunk
[00:08:55.436 --> 00:09:00.158]  Which wasn't even true, because I got quite a few pair of black shoes.
[00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:13.082]  For some reason, I don't have a lot of clothes, but I had a lot of shoes, and I took about three pairs of shoes with me, and had just taken a shower before I left, and put fresh socks on, and had me a new pair of shoes, and there was really no even sweat on my feet.
[00:09:14.662 --> 00:09:18.543]  But it was just a fun, fun thing for the TSA there.
[00:09:18.903 --> 00:09:21.063]  They were jabbing and laughing at other people.
[00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:23.784]  It seemed to be a fun thing.
[00:09:23.804 --> 00:09:27.125]  And I said, excuse me, will your feet stink?
[00:09:27.805 --> 00:09:31.265]  And I just said, man, it's good to live in a hell pit country.
[00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:35.226]  And I just said, isn't that nice?
[00:09:35.286 --> 00:09:37.287]  I just laughed back at them.
[00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:38.927]  That is very funny.
[00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:45.737]  You know, I've seen a lot of the old photos and old footage, film of Nazis when they go into Poland.
[00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:52.683]  They're kicking people in the hind end and laughing at them and laughing at their torn clothes and making jokes.
[00:09:52.763 --> 00:09:55.545]  It wasn't as bad yesterday, I shouldn't complain.
[00:09:56.506 --> 00:10:05.894]  Really, it's no big deal to have TSA screeners who could take the cake at a casting call if they wanted to make some film about gang members.
[00:10:06.764 --> 00:10:09.167]  I mean, really, they were ready.
[00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:10.309]  They fit the bill.
[00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:12.632]  It was just nice to have gang member ties.
[00:10:12.652 --> 00:10:14.835]  Probably most of them weren't a gang just a few years ago.
[00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:16.357]  I'd just go through.
[00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:20.904]  I was tired from meetings and working late into the night every evening.
[00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:23.219]  So I wasn't being uppity.
[00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.640]  I didn't say anything.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.263]  I took my shoes off and learned how to be a slave and let them search my goods.
[00:10:30.983 --> 00:10:33.704]  I sat there in the chair and they said, stick your feet out.
[00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:35.565]  We're going to run the wand over you.
[00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:39.267]  And then they ran the wand over my little metal belt buckle.
[00:10:39.327 --> 00:10:41.288]  It has a little metal lip on it.
[00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:43.329]  Just a standard black belt.
[00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.031]  And they said, take your belt off.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.741]  And I sat there, did a hat, but it was a little, they were laughing, and oh man, look at those stinky feet!
[00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:53.022]  And I said, excuse me?
[00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:54.702]  And they said, we said you have stinky feet!
[00:10:55.483 --> 00:11:04.905]  You know, it's just like in the movies where, you know, somebody's in Russia, and they corner you in the dark alley and go, mmm, and start prodding you and asking you questions.
[00:11:05.045 --> 00:11:08.266]  It's nice to have thugs leering over you.
[00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:11.147]  It reminds you that this show's totally made up.
[00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:12.228]  There's no police state.
[00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:13.588]  There's no problem.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.942]  You know, in the past I've seen them prodding people with oxygen tanks.
[00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:18.802]  We have photos.
[00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:23.945]  We've gotten up on the website of that, that I and others have covertly snapped.
[00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:26.786]  We've got a big AP photo up there, what, about a week ago.
[00:11:26.846 --> 00:11:32.129]  Paul Watson wrote an article about it, and it shows an old man who can't even walk.
[00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:37.052]  He's in the wheelchair, and they're having him go through different gesticulations.
[00:11:38.186 --> 00:11:39.887]  But again, that's freedom, folks.
[00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:46.009]  Old men with oxygen tanks being prodded by gibbering gang members is freedom.
[00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:53.851]  Millions of people waving Mexican flags, screaming it's a la reconquista is freedom.
[00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:59.993]  And having politicians that actually love what's happening is freedom.
[00:12:00.494 --> 00:12:06.356]  By the way, one of my employees' cars, trucks, broke one of its belts today coming into work.
[00:12:06.376 --> 00:12:07.436]  So one of our friends
[00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:18.949]  He graciously dropped by from, I guess he runs a shop now, an auto repair shop himself, a very good mechanic.
[00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:23.210]  He graciously popped by to put a new belt on, and he's a Hispanic.
[00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.931]  And he said to me, just about 10 minutes before I went in there, he said, I'm scared.
[00:12:27.672 --> 00:12:28.492]  He said, you're right.
[00:12:28.512 --> 00:12:34.954]  He said, some of the people that work for me and with me, he said, he jokingly said, I'm afraid they're going to kill me.
[00:12:34.974 --> 00:12:35.714]  And I go, are you joking?
[00:12:36.932 --> 00:12:44.257]  You know, they're just real proud of the Mexican Mafia, and they're real proud of the Lurican Quista, some of them, and they just say, we're taking over.
[00:12:44.858 --> 00:12:46.679]  And what's your problem for being against it?
[00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:48.460]  Because he loves America.
[00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:51.582]  Loving America is bad.
[00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:56.346]  Being prodded and told you have stinky feet by goons is good.
[00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:03.871]  So, um, it's amazing.
[00:13:05.527 --> 00:13:29.137]  It really is amazing that the country's turned into this, and the Feds have even said that the TSA is there, now they've changed the name, they've changed it every few months, but ICE and all these other groups and the federal protective details and the individuals that protect infrastructure
[00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:45.593]  They openly said three and a half, I guess now four years ago, time is flying, that they were going to take the things they do at the airport, searching you, stripping you, making women pull their dresses up and show their panties in public.
[00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:48.395]  That's been the San Francisco Chronicle and even Sacramento Bee.
[00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:53.018]  One big case of that in front of about a hundred people in a line, laughing at the pregnant woman's large belly.
[00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:58.381]  See, the shoving us around and laughing at us is even encouraged, I believe.
[00:13:59.247 --> 00:14:02.089]  So, I even experienced it yesterday, it was wonderful.
[00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:13.275]  And I told everybody I saw him on C-SPAN, Ridge talked about this, back when he was Homeland Security Director, even before he got funding, before he even had the position officially, he'd just been named it by the Emperor.
[00:14:15.035 --> 00:14:17.016]  Rise Darth Ridge!
[00:14:17.837 --> 00:14:18.597]  I mean, it's sick!
[00:14:19.578 --> 00:14:23.280]  Show no mercy, Lord Ridge, Lord Gonzalez!
[00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:25.781]  Drive them into submission.
[00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:28.302]  Let them know that we rule with an iron fist.
[00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:30.582]  I mean, this is literally what we're living under now.
[00:14:32.103 --> 00:14:37.584]  And people couldn't believe me about that when they announced, what, six months ago, Viper teams from Dallas to Miami.
[00:14:37.864 --> 00:14:41.805]  Oh, we're going to randomly go into shopping malls and search everyone.
[00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:43.825]  Not that we think there's a terrorist there.
[00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:45.926]  We're just going to randomly go in and do this.
[00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:50.335]  And now we're living under it.
[00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:55.237]  Now the police are being given federal training and being taught how to corral and control us.
[00:14:56.157 --> 00:14:57.738]  Meanwhile, the border is totally wide open.
[00:14:57.758 --> 00:15:03.640]  And I was watching CNN this weekend, and they would say on there,
[00:15:04.378 --> 00:15:06.058]  I mean, I watched hours of it, actually.
[00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:08.059]  I rarely watch TV, but it was all about immigration.
[00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:11.980]  It was all, these are human beings, these are sweet, good people that love America.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:24.042]  It was all these individual cases, how they can't get their children from Mexico up here, how families are split up, and how the protesters were American citizens who were protesting for the immigrants.
[00:15:24.502 --> 00:15:33.924]  It wasn't immigrants out there doing it, and they're not illegal aliens, and it shed one reporter in Georgia going, it's a losing battle, we've taken over, and there's nothing you can do.
[00:15:35.223 --> 00:15:59.116]  I bet a lot of you saw that, and I saw Lou Dobbs with the former Mexican ambassador now with the World Bank up there, and it was just how wonderful the open borders are, and he was throwing these softballs at the guy, and it's just, even on shows that are supposedly against all this, it's a back-peddling, soft-soaping, just fraud.
[00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:02.117]  But I'm not going to, I'm going to get more into that later.
[00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:03.478]  Okay, more into that later.
[00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:08.144]  Let me just stop right now and get into a few other issues.
[00:16:08.944 --> 00:16:27.197]  Remember over the years I covered documents, I covered trade publications, we covered legislation where every major phone company hub by law in 1996 got nine billion dollars that by October 1st 2001
[00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:37.771]  Every phone call, whether it runs through copper, whether it's cell, whether it's fiber optic, whether it's cable, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:41.975]  Every phone call goes through the NSA.
[00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:46.219]  The NSA is the phone company.
[00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:51.784]  And occasionally I'll go look at what blogs are saying or what message boards are saying.
[00:16:51.804 --> 00:16:57.329]  I'll do a search, spend 30 minutes just checking, kind of as research, to see what people are saying about what we cover here.
[00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:04.212]  And even a lot of the so-called conspiracy sites and so-called patriot and truth sites, well Alex is exaggerating.
[00:17:05.132 --> 00:17:07.133]  They don't have hubs in the phone companies.
[00:17:07.173 --> 00:17:10.614]  They occasionally listen in.
[00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:14.716]  And then of course you now have national news for what started Friday.
[00:17:15.563 --> 00:17:16.703]  I can dig the articles out.
[00:17:16.723 --> 00:17:21.665]  You know, headline, NSA has secret room in San Francisco AT&T.
[00:17:22.065 --> 00:17:23.365]  AT&T being sued.
[00:17:23.725 --> 00:17:27.487]  That's only because an AT&T employee, high-level there, blew the whistle.
[00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:29.387]  And the media is acting like it's just there.
[00:17:29.607 --> 00:17:35.869]  Listen, again, you have the national news that just basically spins and lies and whitewashes and waters down.
[00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:40.471]  When they do get caught, they'll tell you about one one-millionth of what's really going on.
[00:17:41.511 --> 00:17:41.791]  Okay?
[00:17:43.214 --> 00:17:46.396]  And then you have the trade publications and the admissions.
[00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:53.440]  Congress passed a law in 1996, a regulatory law, to give and to fund it.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.221]  The phone companies said in telecommunications, you've got to pay for this.
[00:17:56.261 --> 00:17:56.842]  We can't do this.
[00:17:57.102 --> 00:17:58.062]  This is going to cost billions.
[00:17:58.082 --> 00:17:59.163]  It was going to be $5 billion.
[00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.544]  It was over $9 billion by the time it all ended.
[00:18:01.584 --> 00:18:04.186]  And there's hundreds of millions in maintenance costs every year.
[00:18:04.858 --> 00:18:16.788]  Okay, the NSA, everything runs through an NSA area of Southwestern Bell, AT&T, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:24.074]  In fact, in some cases, I've been told by the employees at the phone companies, in some cases, half the building is NSA.
[00:18:24.674 --> 00:18:26.896]  I mean, it isn't just one room.
[00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:29.378]  Again, you people can't deal with the truth.
[00:18:29.798 --> 00:18:31.820]  I don't think some of you can really handle it.
[00:18:34.725 --> 00:18:49.322]  Of course, we knew from leaks and documents and from past dirty tricks that Karl Rove, on orders of Dick Cheney, leaked the Valerie Plame information and then Bush said, we'll arrest whoever did it, we'll fire whoever did it.
[00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:53.786]  First it was, we'll arrest, then it turned out it was Scooter Libby, and they said, okay, well, we'll fire.
[00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:55.028]  Well, and then he resigned.
[00:18:55.643 --> 00:18:59.526]  And then we're going to catch who did this, and then they get caught.
[00:18:59.546 --> 00:19:08.954]  They leaked it, they released it, they spin it, because they released it with some other staged WMD's assessment, which, that's even worse, if you really look at it.
[00:19:09.554 --> 00:19:22.184]  But they spin it with that, and then they go, well, yeah, the President, Scott McClellan last week, the President is allowed, Alberto Gonzales before Congress said the same thing, the President is allowed to leak whatever he wants.
[00:19:22.842 --> 00:19:25.823]  He is above the law, just like he's above the law to spy on you without warrants.
[00:19:26.464 --> 00:19:27.804]  He's above the law on torture.
[00:19:27.824 --> 00:19:33.066]  He's above the law... He signed a $2 billion spending bill, what, a month and a half ago, that no one passed.
[00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:33.667]  And you know what?
[00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:36.728]  Senators wrote letters and said, this didn't pass, you signed it.
[00:19:36.748 --> 00:19:38.729]  Bush said, eh, I don't care.
[00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:41.890]  We've entered Twilight Zone.
[00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:43.379]  No, no, no.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.561]  We've entered the twilight zone of the twilight zone.
[00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:48.762]  If we live in a twilight zone world, there'd still be something even weirder.
[00:19:48.862 --> 00:19:57.767]  So, in the twilight zone world, there would be a twilight zone world, and a twilight zone world of that twilight zone world, and then we're the twilight zone of the twilight zone of that twilight zone.
[00:19:58.167 --> 00:19:59.248]  If you, if you read me.
[00:20:01.649 --> 00:20:03.730]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.172]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:07.152]  New toenails?
[00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:08.513]  Well, what happened to the old ones?
[00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:12.155]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:14.135]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:20:14.155 --> 00:20:16.936]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[00:20:17.156 --> 00:20:18.536]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:20.657]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:20:20.817 --> 00:20:22.158]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:20:22.218 --> 00:20:25.019]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.499]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.100]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.642]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:34.262]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:37.063]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:20:37.323 --> 00:20:38.964]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:42.546]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:20:42.927 --> 00:20:43.487]  You bet!
[00:20:43.687 --> 00:20:47.810]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.491]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:51.012]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:51.192 --> 00:20:52.853]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[00:20:53.234 --> 00:20:58.317]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[00:20:58.517 --> 00:20:59.538]  In the foot care section.
[00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:04.049]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.469 --> 00:21:09.956]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.517 --> 00:21:11.018]  That's right.
[00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:14.222]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:21.111]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.664 --> 00:21:29.348]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:34.650]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.292]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.073 --> 00:21:45.215]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.595 --> 00:21:45.835]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.855 --> 00:21:47.776]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:48.156]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.456 --> 00:21:48.737]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.064 --> 00:22:06.346]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:22:06.547 --> 00:22:08.627]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:22:08.868 --> 00:22:15.991]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:27.636]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:35.421]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:40.685]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[00:22:40.805 --> 00:22:45.828]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[00:22:46.108 --> 00:22:51.492]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.512 --> 00:22:52.733]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:52.813 --> 00:22:54.034]  That's toll-free, trip-free,
[00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:02.760]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:06.163]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:11.768]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:23:12.068 --> 00:23:21.616]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:24.078]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:27.920]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.402]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:23:31.682 --> 00:23:35.225]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:23:35.385 --> 00:23:38.847]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:23:38.987 --> 00:23:40.248]  I'm really amazed.
[00:23:40.408 --> 00:23:46.251]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.793]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:23:49.153 --> 00:23:57.275]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODORS.
[00:23:57.455 --> 00:23:59.435]  That's 1-866-NO-ODORS.
[00:24:08.537 --> 00:24:09.717]  Alright, welcome back folks.
[00:24:10.317 --> 00:24:12.798]  Let me spend a few minutes on the staged
[00:24:13.763 --> 00:24:20.568]  It's what, two and a half weeks of millions of people running around waving Mexican flags, getting in everyone's face.
[00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:32.637]  I noticed over the weekend, watching CNN and Fox, that suddenly you didn't see 90 foreign flags, half of them being Mexican, compared to every American flag.
[00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:35.980]  You would see hundreds of American flags and a few Mexican flags.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.062]  If you looked carefully, the media didn't want to focus in on them.
[00:24:40.442 --> 00:24:54.472]  I heard a national radio host this morning trying to explain to his callers that Americans don't care, or Americans are individualists, so that's why they don't go out and counter-demonstrate this, even though 80-plus percent of Americans, including Hispanics, are against what's happening.
[00:24:54.792 --> 00:24:57.214]  Hispanic Americans, very patriotic folks.
[00:24:57.935 --> 00:24:59.255]  And no, that's not the answer.
[00:24:59.295 --> 00:25:05.380]  The answer is, our media, so-called English-speaking media, American media,
[00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:15.678]  predominantly owns the Spanish-speaking media and so the English media is there to pacify, abscond, cover up, whitewash what's going on.
[00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:21.361]  Even, you know, two weeks ago they do their best to just show the few American flags up front and zoom in on those.
[00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:24.857]  And so, it still backfired.
[00:25:25.178 --> 00:25:26.879]  These demonstrations backfired.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.762]  It is now totally blown up in the little Reconquista's face.
[00:25:30.123 --> 00:25:31.144]  I saw this happening.
[00:25:31.624 --> 00:25:32.185]  I saw this.
[00:25:32.205 --> 00:25:35.048]  I mean, it just, a lot of times their propaganda backfires.
[00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:40.033]  And so now, all over the country, I noticed over the weekend, it was mainly
[00:25:41.045 --> 00:25:44.527]  Mainly, and of course on Monday and Tuesday, American flags.
[00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:58.234]  Well, locally, while I was gone, Ryan and Aaron went down to some of the local demonstrations, and then Kevin Smith was here recording television, and he saw the exact same thing.
[00:25:58.334 --> 00:26:00.074]  And to understand, there's talking points.
[00:26:00.355 --> 00:26:03.216]  When these immigrant groups' leaders are on TV or radio, they're like,
[00:26:03.476 --> 00:26:04.517]  We love America.
[00:26:04.577 --> 00:26:06.378]  We're just here to love your country.
[00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:07.899]  You go down to the demonstrations.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.581]  I would say about half the people are.
[00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:10.682]  We're taking America over.
[00:26:10.942 --> 00:26:11.702]  Get out of here.
[00:26:12.343 --> 00:26:13.364]  Plan of San Diego.
[00:26:13.444 --> 00:26:14.284]  You need to die.
[00:26:14.765 --> 00:26:16.146]  Kevin, you've got a few minutes here.
[00:26:16.206 --> 00:26:24.452]  I drug you in here because I want to hear the report you got back from Ryan and Aaron and then what you saw on the local news.
[00:26:24.512 --> 00:26:25.733]  Relay that to the listeners, please.
[00:26:26.494 --> 00:26:27.275]  I sure will Alex.
[00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:31.638]  You know, I heard you back at the height of all the go home, go back to Europe stuff.
[00:26:31.658 --> 00:26:41.506]  You called into a talk show and there was like a LULAC or some Moldov representative on and you said something about the race, you know, La Raza.
[00:26:41.526 --> 00:26:44.768]  She goes, oh no, I'm referring to the human race.
[00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:45.989]  It's the human race.
[00:26:46.049 --> 00:26:53.315]  And we saw those protests, those huge protests and it was all foreign flags and we're going to get you gringo and all that.
[00:26:53.355 --> 00:26:56.197]  So you saw a shift within the last week.
[00:26:57.197 --> 00:26:58.799]  Uh, that was blowing up in their face.
[00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:05.928]  So we were watching the newscast and sure enough it was almost all American flags, only very few Mexican flags.
[00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:14.418]  And then they would ask them in the talking points that the people were saying, well, yeah, I came here for a better life, a land of opportunity for me and mine.
[00:27:15.034 --> 00:27:17.977]  You know, the standard stuff that you've always heard in the past.
[00:27:18.297 --> 00:27:29.266]  And even when they couldn't enunciate that correctly, the reporter would say, well, I think what you're trying to say is that you came here to get a new life for you and yours and land of opportunity.
[00:27:29.546 --> 00:27:30.447]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:27:30.487 --> 00:27:31.388]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:27:31.468 --> 00:27:35.932]  So the reporters were not only holding their hands, they were putting words in their mouth.
[00:27:36.172 --> 00:27:38.834]  And I believe that there were a number of
[00:27:40.056 --> 00:27:44.085]  Latin racist websites where they got on conference calls and said, listen, we need to change our strategy.
[00:27:44.126 --> 00:27:45.549]  This is blowing up on our face.
[00:27:45.589 --> 00:27:48.296]  We've awoken a sleeping giant, we believe.
[00:27:49.412 --> 00:27:51.414]  Well, that's not our opinion.
[00:27:51.554 --> 00:27:56.980]  In fact, two weeks ago, it was on the sites that, oh, very skilled that we put the American flags up front.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.701]  That fooled them.
[00:27:57.761 --> 00:27:58.341]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:27:58.361 --> 00:28:01.324]  You know, the land of Auslan will soon be, you know, with us.
[00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:09.453]  And then I went to all their sites where you could watch real video clips, and you could watch the speeches, and you could, I mean, there are editorials in the LA Times while I was there.
[00:28:09.973 --> 00:28:21.476]  You know, saying, you know, we run L.A., you know, this is Mexico, and then the local TV station bought a 670-something billboards saying, this is Mexico, we have taken over.
[00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:25.357]  And so, now then ask yourselves, why are the corporations behind this?
[00:28:25.697 --> 00:28:27.237]  Why is Bush and the Democrats behind this?
[00:28:27.277 --> 00:28:28.157]  It isn't just cheap labor.
[00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:30.978]  It is driving down the wages, bringing in a new world order.
[00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:40.089]  Well, you know, the Bush administration and the military-industrial complex, they kind of get the rap as they're the right-wing fascist New World Order.
[00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:42.110]  And you've always said, hey, they're going to have an alternative.
[00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.612]  They're going to have that left-wing socialist New World Order alternative.
[00:28:45.652 --> 00:28:48.694]  And I think that's what we're seeing right now with this immigration issue.
[00:28:48.735 --> 00:28:50.336]  This is their left-wing plan.
[00:28:50.736 --> 00:28:58.841]  Because, you know, the next big demonstrations they have nationwide, a nationwide work stoppage by immigrants and by Hispanics is going to be May 1st.
[00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:01.063]  So they're going to be celebrating May Day with a big strike.
[00:29:01.764 --> 00:29:04.465]  That's right, that's the International Communist Celebration Day.
[00:29:04.805 --> 00:29:06.926]  Oh, we're conspiracy theorists, we shouldn't talk about it.
[00:29:07.686 --> 00:29:11.688]  But understand folks, if the mainstream media in the U.S.
[00:29:12.588 --> 00:29:29.035]  for two months, that's what happened, and it's admitted, Associated Press reported, that for two months, the Spanish TV, radio, and newsprint said, we're taking America over, we're going to do this constantly, wear white, go out there, and now imagine if the media suddenly told Americans
[00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:31.016]  That it's okay to care about America.
[00:29:31.036 --> 00:29:32.936]  It's okay to go out and protest to control the border.
[00:29:33.316 --> 00:29:33.876]  It would happen.
[00:29:34.417 --> 00:29:35.857]  They tried to orchestrate a fight.
[00:29:35.877 --> 00:29:40.959]  They tried to orchestrate putting everybody back into their shells, putting us back in the closet, making us shut up.
[00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.359]  It blew up in your face, as usual, New World Order.
[00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:44.600]  You're going to lose.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.880]  Kevin, thanks for joining us.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.241]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:52.542]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.022 --> 00:29:54.623]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.543 --> 00:29:58.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:05.120]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.722]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.

[00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:18.356]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:25.603]  In 30 minutes, we've got Daniel Escalon joining us from Madrid, Spain for a report on the Bilderberg Group and what the global rulers are up to.
[00:33:26.244 --> 00:33:35.593]  Of course, one of their main plans is open borders, destroying national sovereignty, Pan-American Union, European Union, Asian Union, One World Currency, One World Tax.
[00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.715]  We'll get into all of it and the open border situation.
[00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:39.777]  Get his take on that.
[00:33:39.837 --> 00:33:41.759]  We will have open phones today as well.
[00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:46.343]  And then later in the third hour, I've got a guest who writes for a mainstream publication in Canada.
[00:33:46.764 --> 00:33:48.605]  He's only had two articles refused.
[00:33:48.766 --> 00:33:51.028]  One was on 9-11, the other on Charlie Sheen.
[00:33:52.379 --> 00:33:53.560]  No, we're not looking for positive pieces on that.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.681]  No, we only allow negative pieces.
[00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:57.223]  Or, no, we're not picking your story up.
[00:34:07.392 --> 00:34:09.653]  But that's why the mainstream media is in so much trouble.
[00:34:09.673 --> 00:34:11.935]  And then here are the other type of articles I have in front of me.
[00:34:12.395 --> 00:34:14.276]  I love this one that Paul Watson put out.
[00:34:14.596 --> 00:34:19.679]  White House claims no agenda to attack Iran, but Easter Bunny is real and not fictitious.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.700]  That's really funny.
[00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:23.161]  And Paul wrote this one.
[00:34:23.882 --> 00:34:26.623]  Claims 7-7 bombers planned to drown tens of thousands.
[00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:29.745]  Group caught attempting to explode bomb under Thames River.
[00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:32.266]  Disappeared.
[00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:33.227]  Oh, government group.
[00:34:33.707 --> 00:34:34.908]  Just more proof of that.
[00:34:36.645 --> 00:34:39.348]  I mean, there is so much here.
[00:34:39.408 --> 00:34:40.188]  There is so much here.
[00:34:40.208 --> 00:34:41.730]  Also, Cheney got booed.
[00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:51.678]  The credibility of dissenting viewpoint, Cheney was booed when he threw the opening pitch at a baseball game and the media is trying to spin that.
[00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.382]  It's just an example of how unpopular these individuals are.
[00:34:57.303 --> 00:34:58.244]  Then I have stories here.
[00:34:59.048 --> 00:35:00.068]  This is the Times of London.
[00:35:00.108 --> 00:35:02.730]  Drug companies inventing diseases to boost their profits.
[00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.231]  Their own memos, their own documents are coming out.
[00:35:05.651 --> 00:35:08.252]  We don't need memos and secret documents to know this.
[00:35:08.292 --> 00:35:11.793]  We can watch what they're doing and tell what their plan is.
[00:35:12.074 --> 00:35:17.276]  Then I have another one, Associated Press, where they're going to start ripping the teeth out of prisoners if you have gold.
[00:35:17.996 --> 00:35:22.918]  This is just Nazi behavior out in the open because, oh, you owe fines and fees.
[00:35:22.938 --> 00:35:24.279]  We're going to take your gold.
[00:35:28.087 --> 00:35:29.708]  Again, I've entered the ninth circle of hell.
[00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:31.269]  We have entered the twilight zone.
[00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:39.713]  We've got to give up all our rights because the terrorists are about to attack us, but there are millions of people running around saying we're taking America over, with our media covering up what they're really saying and doing.
[00:35:40.173 --> 00:35:42.515]  Paul Watson, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:35:43.175 --> 00:35:44.176]  Good to be here, Alex.
[00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:46.317]  Let's start out with your...
[00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:51.881]  Your report about how they don't plan to attack Iran, but the Easter Bunny is real not fictitious.
[00:35:51.921 --> 00:36:03.451]  I mean, we knew two years ago that they did an emergency funding of tens of billions of dollars to produce over 200 mini bunker-busting nukes.
[00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:05.733]  You're telling me what else the government is going to do with all those mini-nukes?
[00:36:06.313 --> 00:36:08.335]  I'm sure detonate one and claim the terrorists did it.
[00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:15.417]  They want to destroy too much of their real estate, just 10 or 15 city blocks instead of a whole city, when they bomb us here in the near future.
[00:36:15.457 --> 00:36:18.818]  I predict it's an 80% plus chance that'll happen in the next two years.
[00:36:19.258 --> 00:36:24.080]  But, I mean, they openly are saying they're going to attack them.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.520]  They're openly gearing up for it.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:31.182]  The memos have come out from London that they're planning to attack Iran in the next 6 to 10 months.
[00:36:31.602 --> 00:36:33.963]  But, no, they say it's a conspiracy theory, Paul.
[00:36:34.183 --> 00:36:34.863]  There's no plan.
[00:36:34.883 --> 00:36:35.363]  Tell us about it.
[00:36:36.713 --> 00:36:39.996]  Right, well, yeah, it came out on Sunday.
[00:36:40.036 --> 00:36:48.383]  Seymour Hersh said they were planning on using these bunker busters to attack the underground nuclear sites in Iran.
[00:36:48.924 --> 00:36:52.427]  Wild speculation, Bush called it on Monday.
[00:36:52.707 --> 00:36:55.089]  Rumsfeld called it fantasyland.
[00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.694]  Jack Straw, the UK Foreign Secretary, called it completely nuts.
[00:37:01.707 --> 00:37:06.912]  So, when it happens, we're going to bring those quotes back to light and expose them for the lies they are.
[00:37:07.472 --> 00:37:19.223]  The Bunkerbusters themselves, I link to articles from September 2004, where Israel purchased 500 of them from the United States.
[00:37:20.084 --> 00:37:22.786]  So, today it's a new story, it's missing the point.
[00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:24.288]  And then yesterday,
[00:37:24.864 --> 00:37:34.028]  World Tribune carried an article saying that the Council on Foreign Relations in a meeting had been told that basically it's a done deal.
[00:37:35.088 --> 00:37:38.610]  Dick Cheney wants it, Donald Rumsfeld wants it, and it's going to happen.
[00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:51.215]  So I suppose the upcoming Bilderberg meeting will kind of put the rubber stamp exactly on when it's going to be, as happened with the Iraq war where they delayed it for half a year or so.
[00:37:53.257 --> 00:38:05.363]  But with Iran, we have this situation where they are a signatory to this NPT treaty, Non-Proliferation Treaty, whereas India are not.
[00:38:06.203 --> 00:38:11.806]  India being the country that nearly went to nuclear war with Pakistan in 2002.
[00:38:12.826 --> 00:38:18.589]  And before that, the British and American military establishment were arming both sides.
[00:38:19.352 --> 00:38:24.995]  But we can sell sophisticated nuclear technology to India, and it's not a problem.
[00:38:25.635 --> 00:38:26.056]  Why?
[00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:31.359]  Because as Henry Kissinger said two or three weeks ago, India is part of the New World Order.
[00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:33.840]  Iran, being a rogue state, is not.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:42.865]  So it's not about who has nukes, it's about whether the countries that have them are part of the Anglo-American control establishment.
[00:38:44.646 --> 00:38:46.447]  Well, you're absolutely right, but
[00:38:47.842 --> 00:39:00.253]  Yeah, Israel purchased 500 conventional bunker busters that can also be converted rather quickly to carry hydrogen bombs within them.
[00:39:00.994 --> 00:39:03.416]  And of course, they penetrate to 20 feet and then detonate.
[00:39:03.956 --> 00:39:10.082]  And then at the same time, top generals, generals who are known as being conservative, who recently retired,
[00:39:11.172 --> 00:39:18.638]  have gone public and said, yes indeed, this is going on, the brass is threatening to revolt, this is going to start World War III.
[00:39:19.498 --> 00:39:23.041]  That's exactly what Cheney and Bush and their controllers want.
[00:39:23.421 --> 00:39:25.883]  They're in deep trouble, their whole agenda is in deep trouble.
[00:39:25.943 --> 00:39:33.549]  If they attack Iran with, yes ladies and gentlemen, hundreds of nukes, they say over 200 sites that they plan to hit,
[00:39:34.304 --> 00:39:37.466]  If they do that, Iran has no choice whether you love them or hate them, folks.
[00:39:37.486 --> 00:39:39.867]  I don't particularly love people in Iran that run the government there.
[00:39:40.307 --> 00:39:48.551]  They had a more moderate government, and our government tried to push them around, so the extremists got into power, and they're going to fight back.
[00:39:49.272 --> 00:39:59.016]  Or, if they don't fight back properly and can't strike the U.S., the globalists will and claim they did it, then we're going to have national conscription, and we're going to march off into the new world order.
[00:40:00.537 --> 00:40:02.178]  Meanwhile, the border will be open here, and
[00:40:02.876 --> 00:40:07.139]  You know, when you go to the TSA, they can take your shoes off and say your feet stink and laugh at you.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.602]  By the way, Paul, did you hear at the start of the show how I got laughed at yesterday leaving LAX?
[00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:14.745]  They made me take my shoes off and then laughed and said my feet stunk.
[00:40:15.025 --> 00:40:16.626]  By the way, my feet didn't stink, folks.
[00:40:17.226 --> 00:40:18.567]  It was just totally made up.
[00:40:19.368 --> 00:40:21.489]  But I mean, this is what America's turned into.
[00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.752]  I'm being prodded by people saying I have stinky feet.
[00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:25.872]  Ha ha ha.
[00:40:26.113 --> 00:40:27.073]  But it's for security.
[00:40:27.093 --> 00:40:28.034]  But the border's wide open.
[00:40:29.229 --> 00:40:38.114]  Yeah, last week there was a 83-year-old woman in a wheelchair at Denver International who had had a stroke, a hip replacement, a heart attack.
[00:40:38.554 --> 00:40:50.021]  She was under doctor's orders not to stand up but the TSA insisted on dragging her out of her wheelchair and giving her a full body search because she may have been a terrorist.
[00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:54.684]  I guess the profile for terrorists is now 83-year-old grandmothers with hip problems.
[00:40:57.674 --> 00:40:59.815]  By the way, the documents have come out.
[00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:01.655]  They are encouraged to be mean to us.
[00:41:02.135 --> 00:41:04.196]  We're being trained, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:04.736 --> 00:41:05.656]  We're being gelded.
[00:41:05.756 --> 00:41:07.256]  We're being domesticated.
[00:41:09.357 --> 00:41:21.640]  And then the solution is truth-telling machines at Moscow Airport, which I guess the TSA are probably salivating over, whereby one of the questions is,
[00:41:22.765 --> 00:41:25.186]  And this is, you don't fly if you fail the test.
[00:41:25.286 --> 00:41:28.387]  One of the questions is, have you ever lied to the authorities?
[00:41:29.548 --> 00:41:32.969]  Who in their entire life hasn't lied to some authority or another?
[00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:45.555]  But they're going in Moscow airports, so that's the next expansion of the police state in the airports, getting you used to it, which eventually will be on all street corners and shopping malls, the same kind of technology.
[00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:50.457]  Yeah, five airports for four years, and the US CBS News reported four years ago,
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:03.626]  And that's how many I know of, have a passive MRI that brain scans you, and then if a certain area of your brain is active, it shows you're angry, you must be a terrorist.
[00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:08.729]  Now again folks, we've proven that the lie detector test, the old one, is a fraud.
[00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:10.830]  It's not now really admissible in court.
[00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:11.691]  It's being phased out.
[00:42:12.271 --> 00:42:16.574]  So they just come out with more sophisticated black boxes with a computer screen
[00:42:17.779 --> 00:42:35.330]  And oh, this shows that you're angry, this shows that you're bad, this shows you're lying, so it's not just that you're quote-on-a-note fly list because we say so, now it's, well, it's not like Nazi Germany where Jews can't travel, or now American patriots can't travel, it's that the computer says you're bad.
[00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:46.677]  Yeah, and there was also a guy in a taxi heading for an airport in Britain who was singing along to some flash punk records in the taxi.
[00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:57.619]  The taxi driver informed the airport police that he was a potential terrorist, because he was singing along to some punk songs, and they investigated him.
[00:42:57.719 --> 00:43:00.582]  So again, that's Darzi Society that's being encouraged.
[00:43:01.203 --> 00:43:11.046]  Especially in Britain, with the massive poster campaign, encouraging people to inform on their neighbors, inform on people who drive vehicles or own houses.
[00:43:11.706 --> 00:43:13.386]  By the way, you're not joking.
[00:43:13.406 --> 00:43:24.990]  It actually says drives vehicles, owns houses, pays their bills a certain way, and then we have the Virginia federally written manual for all state employees saying, what's the exact quote?
[00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.010]  Property rights activists.
[00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.351]  Yes, it says they are terrorists.
[00:43:30.822 --> 00:43:31.062]  Yeah.
[00:43:31.503 --> 00:43:51.618]  But, but, but, if you're an illegal alien running around waving a foreign flag saying you're going to take over and wearing a t-shirt advocating the killing of all white males above the age of 16... Oh, by the way, a point made by my staff who did go down and videotape and cover in the last two days the local demonstrations and protests.
[00:43:51.638 --> 00:43:55.801]  Here I'll be playing some clips from the TV show tonight and put it on the website for members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:43:58.197 --> 00:44:04.681]  If you go out for a land rights rally, second amendment rally, or I've gone for a rally for a little black girl wrongly jailed.
[00:44:04.741 --> 00:44:07.783]  I've been to a march for a hispanic man shot in the back.
[00:44:08.604 --> 00:44:09.004]  Okay?
[00:44:09.644 --> 00:44:13.506]  And they will have riot cops bugging their eyes out at you, trying to start problems.
[00:44:14.367 --> 00:44:16.628]  I mean, you can have 50 people marching, and they're there.
[00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:19.850]  In the Darth Vader outfits, you know, the black mask, the helmets, everything.
[00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:25.954]  None of them out for the illegal aliens taking over highways, running around, foaming at the mouth, Paul.
[00:44:27.529 --> 00:44:29.730]  No, and it was now admitted.
[00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.973]  The Pentagon initiated surveillance against tiny little anti-war groups.
[00:44:34.854 --> 00:44:42.839]  And now you've got the sight of millions of Mexicans, Latinos demonstrating, sometimes violently.
[00:44:43.479 --> 00:44:48.943]  And the media has to be balanced on it, but they're not balanced when the Minutemen do anything.
[00:44:49.003 --> 00:44:52.865]  They're demonized as vigilantes, as Bush called them himself.
[00:44:53.005 --> 00:44:54.026]  But, you know, Bush has
[00:44:54.713 --> 00:45:00.658]  Foreclosing the borders, we're told, when he calls the people who are behind the active movement to do that, vigilantes.
[00:45:01.559 --> 00:45:03.661]  By the way, the same thing's happening in your country.
[00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:15.170]  Blair is trying to make the citizens of the UK have absolutely no rights, but then he's caught, this is mainstream news, signing secret documents and agreements to try to accelerate bringing in illegals.
[00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:17.452]  Right, exactly.
[00:45:17.472 --> 00:45:23.077]  I'm one of the forefronts of the propaganda to introduce the ID card.
[00:45:23.895 --> 00:45:30.658]  Is based on stopping illegal immigration when he's behind the push to ramp it up massively.
[00:45:31.518 --> 00:45:38.141]  Well, the folks I was with in LA this weekend watched a little bit of TV, so I saw some of it, and I also listened to talk radio driving around in traffic.
[00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:41.963]  And you hear the caller after caller, yeah, it's horrible, these illegal aliens, the open borders.
[00:45:42.443 --> 00:45:46.645]  I just love George W. I mean, there's a disconnect, Paul.
[00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:49.786]  Let's switch gears, shift gears here for a second.
[00:45:50.487 --> 00:45:54.688]  Yeah, they were apprehended the night before by uniformed police who the source said it was an obvious attempt to
[00:46:19.795 --> 00:46:21.596]  By the way, we continue to be blessed in these attacks.
[00:46:21.616 --> 00:46:24.216]  The attacks are horrible, but I'm saying on 9-11,
[00:46:42.632 --> 00:46:43.912]  Cheney meant to get the Capitol.
[00:46:44.492 --> 00:46:46.793]  Air Force didn't follow orders, shot down 93.
[00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:48.193]  And again with London.
[00:46:48.513 --> 00:47:02.056]  Time and time again, 93, not flight 93, in 1993, the two retarded men they hired, literally retarded, even though the FBI showed them through their agent twice how to park it up against the column, they didn't park it up against the column.
[00:47:03.697 --> 00:47:05.517]  And so it didn't bring down one of the towers.
[00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:09.698]  So over and over again, Paul, they keep screwing up and it saves a lot of lives.
[00:47:09.758 --> 00:47:10.258]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:22.670]  Yeah, which is why, you know, you say to people, well, 9-11 didn't necessarily have to be orchestrated by a large group of people because of the drills confusing the air control people.
[00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:29.452]  And they say, well, if it was orchestrated by a small group of people, surely they'd make mistakes in such a massive operation.
[00:47:29.492 --> 00:47:30.412]  Well, they always do.
[00:47:30.432 --> 00:47:36.514]  9-11 was, at one point on 9-11, there were reports that nine different planes had been hijacked.
[00:47:36.914 --> 00:47:38.114]  That was never clarified.
[00:47:38.843 --> 00:47:44.407]  Um, obviously Flight 93 as well was shot down, so it was meant to be a much bigger attack in scope.
[00:47:45.127 --> 00:47:52.392]  Um, the second wave, kind of, on 9-11, the real attack, the planes with the diversion, the real attack was the collapse of the buildings.
[00:47:52.853 --> 00:48:05.261]  And it seems in the case of 7-7, that this fifth bomb was set to explode either simultaneously with the others or immediately afterwards, therefore drowning all the rescue personnel.
[00:48:05.862 --> 00:48:10.123]  As happened on 9-11 with killing a lot of the rescue personnel with the collapse of the building.
[00:48:10.243 --> 00:48:15.824]  Which then, which then creates heroes for the government and then gets the cops behind the system.
[00:48:15.844 --> 00:48:18.125]  We lost men, we're taking everybody's rights.
[00:48:18.445 --> 00:48:20.545]  But the good cops in London did stop this.
[00:48:20.585 --> 00:48:21.345]  Give us more details.
[00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:26.507]  Yeah, and immediately on the scene was Special Branch and MI5.
[00:48:26.567 --> 00:48:29.087]  They told the uniformed officers to keep quiet.
[00:48:29.687 --> 00:48:32.388]  And then subsequent attempts by the uniformed officers
[00:48:33.418 --> 00:48:40.864]  to track and trace what happened to these terrorists were met with complete silence and they, quote, vanished into thin air.
[00:48:41.705 --> 00:48:53.954]  So if this was a real terrorist organization that the government had stopped and the government had foiled an attack, you know, why would they fail to jump on it as a glorious success in the war on terror?
[00:48:54.595 --> 00:49:01.160]  Because they could have used it as gas mileage for the propaganda war for ID cards and, you know, keeping troops in Iraq.
[00:49:02.251 --> 00:49:03.672]  Um, ad infinitum.
[00:49:03.812 --> 00:49:08.715]  So why would they cover it up if it was such a great success that they had foiled the attack?
[00:49:08.816 --> 00:49:13.999]  Well, I mean, we know that the head of the bombers was a SWAT, known MI6, that's mainstream news.
[00:49:14.419 --> 00:49:19.903]  So, I mean, clearly they're off, clearly the cops stopped them, and then they, they, they covered it up and let their agents get away.
[00:49:21.404 --> 00:49:29.169]  Yeah, because the final report, which hasn't had any play in the media, it's basically quietly released, says that
[00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:34.684]  None of the four bombers, 7-7 bombers, had any link to Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:34.704 --> 00:49:58.661]  So it was not an Al-Qaeda operation, which again backs up our assertion that these guys were dupes who thought they were role-players in this exercise, targeting the same locations at the exact same time on the morning of 7-7, which is statistically, if you're talking about it being coincidental... There's 48 zeros on the number.
[00:49:59.062 --> 00:49:59.322]  Yeah.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:26.009]  So the explanation that the British National Party had for it that the government is somehow covering up and not blaming it on this wider Muslim hate campaign by releasing this final report not implicating them in it is totally inconsistent with the facts because up until that final report, and I've got a link to it in the article,
[00:50:26.877 --> 00:50:35.379]  Britons were bombarded with propaganda from the government and media saying that Al-Qaeda had attacked London and that this was an Al-Qaeda operation.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:43.922]  So the fact that the final report says it doesn't, and it's quietly released, proves that these guys were the Duke that we said they were all along.
[00:50:44.202 --> 00:50:47.203]  Well, the final report on Spain says it wasn't Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:47.663 --> 00:50:47.863]  Yes.
[00:50:48.596 --> 00:50:52.603]  And then Scotland Yard real detectives say these guys weren't bombers and were set up.
[00:50:52.623 --> 00:50:54.827]  I mean, that's not Paul Watson or Alex Jones.
[00:50:54.847 --> 00:50:55.749]  That's Scotland Yard.
[00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.093]  The real cops know what's going on.
[00:50:58.153 --> 00:50:58.754]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.648 --> 00:51:05.489]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.749 --> 00:51:07.329]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.669 --> 00:51:12.351]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.691 --> 00:51:17.112]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.532 --> 00:51:21.733]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.933 --> 00:51:24.774]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.874 --> 00:51:27.355]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:27.575 --> 00:51:34.140]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:41.605]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:52:01.883 --> 00:52:08.107]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.247 --> 00:52:14.410]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.691 --> 00:52:23.136]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.376 --> 00:52:30.400]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:35.523]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.743 --> 00:52:41.147]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.487 --> 00:52:44.569]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:52.815]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:03.023 --> 00:53:03.523]  I think so.

[00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:10.085]  I was listening to Led Zeppelin in the taxi cab.
[00:54:11.626 --> 00:54:15.588]  Amongst other things, the clash as well, and the taxi driver thought it was terror.
[00:54:15.608 --> 00:54:17.209]  Are they gonna come arrest me?
[00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:18.770]  Listen to the terrorism.
[00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:19.230]  Turn it up.
[00:54:27.435 --> 00:54:28.235]  One more time.
[00:54:29.116 --> 00:54:30.116]  Here's the... Listen to it.
[00:54:30.377 --> 00:54:30.977]  Terrorism.
[00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:36.630]  Welcome back.
[00:54:37.611 --> 00:54:39.692]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54:40.752 --> 00:54:44.754]  I'm going to keep Paul with us five minutes to the next hour, and then Daniel Eswine joins us from Madrid, Spain.
[00:54:45.274 --> 00:54:48.376]  We'll have open phones the next hour, and another great guest in the third hour as well.
[00:54:48.736 --> 00:54:49.977]  Totally jam-packed for you.
[00:54:50.257 --> 00:54:51.897]  I am back in the saddle and loving it.
[00:54:52.378 --> 00:54:54.699]  I thought of something just a second ago.
[00:54:54.759 --> 00:55:01.202]  I was out in front of my office, and I guess three or four Hispanic folks were at the business next door that I've never met.
[00:55:01.222 --> 00:55:03.463]  They're, hey Alex Jones, hi, appreciate what you're doing.
[00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:06.212]  They're all, you know, wearing UT shirts and hanging out.
[00:55:06.252 --> 00:55:08.054]  They had some of their, I guess, white friends with them.
[00:55:08.334 --> 00:55:09.655]  See, we all get along real good.
[00:55:09.695 --> 00:55:18.884]  We never really thought about each other being different until all these southerner Mexicans came in here and our government told us that this was Mexico and they told us it was Mexico.
[00:55:18.924 --> 00:55:25.731]  It's kind of like, say you're from New York and then somebody from Texas comes up there and tells you they're taking over.
[00:55:26.354 --> 00:55:30.056]  I mean, certainly Mexicans, historically, have got a place in Texas.
[00:55:30.136 --> 00:55:32.797]  Northern Mexicans in Tejanos are as Texan as it gets.
[00:55:33.137 --> 00:55:34.137]  More Texan than anybody.
[00:55:34.778 --> 00:55:38.779]  But you've got all these people from Southern Mexico with a real population in Central Mexico.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.140]  Ballooning has happened.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.942]  And they're up there, up here now, with their government and others, trying to get everybody fighting with each other.
[00:55:46.322 --> 00:55:47.983]  And I don't appreciate it and I don't like it.
[00:55:48.744 --> 00:55:51.266]  And it's just disgusting, but that's a side issue.
[00:55:51.526 --> 00:55:56.649]  Paul, before we hit a few final news items with you, I want to get your take on the bird flu that popped up supposedly last week there.
[00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.111]  We are ending the special today.
[00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:02.653]  In fact, I got back to town and it was going to end yesterday, but it is over today.
[00:56:02.673 --> 00:56:10.198]  But if you're taking it down in, what, two hours and five minutes, you won't be able to get the five-plus months free when you sign up for a year.
[00:56:10.218 --> 00:56:15.661]  You pay for a little over six months, you get five-plus months, 5.3 months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:15.682 --> 00:56:16.342]  Tell folks about it.
[00:56:17.668 --> 00:56:29.197]  Yeah, it's going to be taken down about an hour after the show ends, so you need to hurry and get it, because we're going to have quite a considerable break before we run that yearly special again.
[00:56:29.717 --> 00:56:37.823]  So you get five months free, which is about, what, $15 off the normal price, which is $54.95.
[00:56:39.968 --> 00:56:41.689]  $39.95 for a whole year.
[00:56:41.989 --> 00:56:45.670]  Now to explain that, you already get three months free whenever you sign up for a year.
[00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.111]  We just added a few more months.
[00:56:47.631 --> 00:56:53.033]  People will do that math and go, what do you mean, you know, $50 something to $39, that's not... So explain that to people.
[00:56:53.893 --> 00:57:07.678]  Yeah, it's based on the fact that if you paid monthly $5.95 a month, you already saved three months by getting the standard yearly, which is $54.95, but with the Spring Special,
[00:57:08.524 --> 00:57:14.669]  Compared to paying monthly, you get over five months free by paying $39.95 upfront.
[00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:19.053]  But it's being taken down very shortly, so we encourage people to go and get it.
[00:57:20.114 --> 00:57:26.499]  And if you don't want to do that, folks, go get a monthly $5.95, download, burn all my films to DVD or disc, give them to people.
[00:57:26.539 --> 00:57:27.640]  It's a great activist tool.
[00:57:27.921 --> 00:57:30.283]  Tell people, Paul, some of the stuff that's on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:30.303 --> 00:57:33.705]  Yeah, there's already a library of
[00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:59.160]  Alex Jones' television show going back to April 2004, two years worth in-studio reports, field location reports like the one I've just put up with the protest of Dean, Keane, sorry, and every major audio interview from the Alex Jones Show, the one with Daniel Estulin will be going up later tonight, every Alex Jones documentary

[00:59:05.772 --> 00:59:09.455]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.955 --> 00:59:14.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.482 --> 00:59:18.243]  Well, I'm back.
[00:59:18.723 --> 00:59:19.624]  I'm back in Austin.
[00:59:21.483 --> 00:59:34.427]  City of Angels this weekend over the last few days and very important business in the fight against the New World Order that someday in the future we'll get to hear about it so very exciting but maybe sooner than later who knows
[00:59:35.134 --> 00:59:37.956]  But Paul Watson riding shotgun with us for another five minutes.
[00:59:37.976 --> 00:59:41.899]  A few other news items from London, from England and globally.
[00:59:41.919 --> 00:59:44.922]  And then we've got Daniel Estelan joining us from Spain, talking about Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:44.942 --> 00:59:46.503]  I've got a lot of other news we'll be covering.
[00:59:46.823 --> 00:59:48.164]  Paul, there's a lot of other issues.
[00:59:48.344 --> 00:59:58.132]  Let me get your take on how we knew it was books that ordered the leak to burn Valerie Plain to go after Wilson, the ambassador on the Yellow Cake Uranium situation, because he wouldn't lie for them.
[00:59:58.412 --> 01:00:01.134]  And then they get caught and they go, OK, well, we're just allowed to.
[01:00:01.534 --> 01:00:04.617]  And there's no discussion in the media about how they lied about this before.
[01:00:05.377 --> 01:00:07.199]  Yeah, the Cheney getting booed one.
[01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:13.225]  I've got weakness for going to football matches twice a month and I know what a boo sounds like and what a cheer sounds like.
[01:00:13.285 --> 01:00:14.907]  For a start,
[01:00:26.232 --> 01:00:31.314]  Bush, Cheney, when they throw these pitches at these baseball games, they never walk out on the field on their own.
[01:00:31.534 --> 01:00:34.535]  Because if they did, it'd be 100% booze, basically.
[01:00:34.995 --> 01:00:37.456]  Cheney walks out with three injured U.S.
[01:00:37.536 --> 01:00:48.679]  servicemen, and yet, go watch the video, I make it 80% booze to 20% cheers, which is, you know, matches his own approval rating.
[01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:50.380]  And by the way, think about that.
[01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:58.672]  They always have the most popular baseball players with them, or they have some guy in a wheelchair, and it still, still is backfiring on them.
[01:00:59.332 --> 01:01:02.654]  Yeah, and my take on it was the media response.
[01:01:03.214 --> 01:01:13.778]  Reuters, cheers, boos as Cheney opens baseball game, with cheers before boos, and capitalized, suggesting that he got more cheers than boos when it was the opposite way around.
[01:01:14.298 --> 01:01:16.339]  So the Washington Post is even worse, because
[01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:32.239]  They suggested that the boos were a result of the fact that he threw a bad pitch, which bounced before the guy caught it, which is outright lying because he was getting booed as he walked onto the field, which the video clearly shows.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.642]  By the way, that's a top story.
[01:01:36.682 --> 01:01:38.283]  I should have told you to get that, Scott.
[01:01:38.503 --> 01:01:40.464]  It's at thetopofprisonplanet.com.
[01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:41.665]  You go grab that audio for us.
[01:01:41.685 --> 01:01:42.066]  Thank you.
[01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:42.786]  Sorry, go ahead, Paul.
[01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.229]  Yeah, so I expanded it into this
[01:01:47.273 --> 01:02:13.398]  journalistic code of ethics whereby everything has to be balanced though they have to say you got cheers as well when it was, you know, 80% to 20% so they totally missed the target intentionally and the Washington Post outright lies but don't get picked up on it and there won't be a retraction but we, the alternative bloggers if you want to call us that, if we make one little faux pas then we get emails saying we're charlatans
[01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:30.933]  So I expanded it into a thing which is why it's called the credibility of the dissenting viewpoint because if you're in the alternative media you're kind of held to a higher standard because you have to prepare yourself for the backlash of people who believe in the dominant paradigm.
[01:02:30.953 --> 01:02:34.555]  But that's good, that's good because what doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[01:02:35.498 --> 01:02:44.245]  Yeah, which is why you'll notice alternative bloggers laboriously source everything they say with hyperlinks to mainstream news sources.
[01:02:44.705 --> 01:02:48.248]  Mainstream news and commentary pieces don't do that.
[01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:54.953]  So because we're held to such a higher standard, we have to be more careful that everything's proven and documented, which is why
[01:02:55.743 --> 01:03:06.996]  The dissenting viewpoint is always more credible, which is kind of the subject of a new book by Michael Parenti that's coming out, so I just expanded it into that in the article.
[01:03:08.257 --> 01:03:08.877]  Well done!
[01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:12.179]  You know, they have that little song, you're a good man, Charlie Brown.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.681]  You're a good man, Paul Watson.
[01:03:15.701 --> 01:03:23.266]  Hey, I appreciate all your, I appreciate all your hard work, Paul.
[01:03:23.706 --> 01:03:26.948]  And I want to get you to check in with us before this weekend.
[01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:30.610]  I like these little 30 minute info bombs that you drop on us.
[01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.271]  And I appreciate your hard work.
[01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:33.392]  I appreciate the whole crew.
[01:03:34.472 --> 01:03:36.494]  And, uh, say hi to your brother for me.
[01:03:37.175 --> 01:03:38.676]  And, uh, we'll be talking to you real soon.
[01:03:38.716 --> 01:03:42.861]  Paul, I hope people will go over to PrisonPlanet.tv, because we're closing the special in just a couple hours.
[01:03:45.664 --> 01:03:46.925]  So, Vaya con Dios, Waddy.
[01:03:48.126 --> 01:03:50.308]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:50.328 --> 01:03:50.729]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.351 --> 01:04:00.196]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:01.877]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.057 --> 01:04:04.258]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.418 --> 01:04:06.500]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.723]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.043 --> 01:04:16.086]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:28.832]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.972 --> 01:04:30.873]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:25.119]  And as soon as it's available here, I want to carry it.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.461]  He's been covering Bilderberg for a lot of big newspapers around the world.
[01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:33.004]  And he's broken a lot of key information on the Bilderberg Group.

[01:07:36.232 --> 01:07:39.473]  Thanks for having me again, Alex, and good day to all your listeners around the world.
[01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:40.153]  You bet.
[01:07:40.213 --> 01:08:00.821]  Tell us, for people who don't know, tell us about yourself, any websites or books, and then tell people who don't know, or those who don't really have a good understanding of it, what the Bilderberg Group is, why it's important, some of the things you've learned there, and then I want to get into what's coming up this year, where you think it's going to be held, it's always a big deal to find out where it's held, and what you may have learned maybe on the agenda this year.
[01:08:02.086 --> 01:08:04.888]  Okay, I've been covering the Billy Boogers for the last 13 years.
[01:08:04.908 --> 01:08:06.489]  It's actually now 14 years.
[01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:14.194]  And I'm a Russian-born Canadian citizen who has been living in Spain for the past 12 years.
[01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:18.938]  As I told you last year, I fell for all the investigative stuff I've been doing for so long.
[01:08:19.098 --> 01:08:26.643]  I'm safer in Europe as I was in the United States and in Canada where the CIA and the RCMP had a pretty good shot at me.
[01:08:27.383 --> 01:08:30.346]  I've been covering the Bilderbergers with Jim Tucker for many years.
[01:08:30.386 --> 01:08:32.408]  Jim Tucker, of course, of the American group Free Press.
[01:08:32.929 --> 01:08:40.415]  And last year I released in Spain with Planeta, which is Spain's biggest publishing group and the 7th largest publishing empire in the world.
[01:08:41.256 --> 01:08:50.505]  What you said is the best-selling book on the Bilderberger Club, which now has gone into the 8th printing and the rights have been sold to 24 countries and 14 languages.
[01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:53.389]  Can I get it in English now?
[01:08:53.409 --> 01:08:54.269]  Because I want to carry it.
[01:08:54.629 --> 01:09:02.613]  Well, we're working on the American and British rights, and we're negotiating with several publishers.
[01:09:02.633 --> 01:09:08.436]  We don't have anything I can report on today, but hopefully over the next couple of months we'll get a new quote.
[01:09:08.456 --> 01:09:15.400]  Which, by the way, would be the biggest market for it, but it shows the control that it's a bestseller all over the place, but you can't get it here.
[01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:35.242]  Well, it's a funny thing, because in Portugal, the book actually was banned by the Portuguese government, which is run by people like Bolsonaro, who is one of the key Bilderbergers, of course, and although he's not officially in power, he runs the country from behind the scenes, and they directly threatened the publisher, which is the third biggest publisher in Portugal, not to release the book.
[01:09:35.263 --> 01:09:41.487]  They did release it, they banned it, but because of the groundwood support and the grass with help from the people in Portugal,
[01:09:42.222 --> 01:09:48.326]  The publisher had no choice but to put the book back on the market, and as a result, it's now in the second edition.
[01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:51.349]  So we are winning very, very important battles from around the world.
[01:09:51.389 --> 01:09:53.510]  But I want to... I mean, I don't want to just glaze over this, folks.
[01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:54.551]  This is mainstream news.
[01:09:54.571 --> 01:09:55.472]  This has been written about.
[01:09:56.032 --> 01:10:04.458]  Imagine governments banning books for just reporting on 125 elitists meeting and openly calling for our enslavement.
[01:10:05.119 --> 01:10:09.822]  I mean, this is how dangerous our information is to these people.
[01:10:10.022 --> 01:10:11.003]  Please continue, Daniel.
[01:10:12.069 --> 01:10:14.090]  That's right, and that's what the billboards are doing.
[01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.351]  Needless to say, they don't want a lot of the stuff revealed.
[01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:26.296]  And in the second book, which we're coming out in September, I talk about the Kosovo War, the reasons for war, which obviously have to do with the drug trade, which is a nefarious business.
[01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:29.557]  A business that makes more money than any other business in the world.
[01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:33.739]  And they no doubt killed some of them in Mlangevic a few weeks ago.
[01:10:36.076 --> 01:10:37.877]  We definitely didn't do enough to save his life.
[01:10:38.578 --> 01:10:40.179]  I've confirmed that through the Russian sources.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.022]  I have a Spanish in the Russian Embassy in Spain.
[01:10:43.715 --> 01:10:51.782]  I'll also be talking about what happened in Russia in 1998, how they tried to destroy Russia through their conduit, the International Monetary Fund.
[01:10:52.322 --> 01:10:54.644]  I will go over the war in Afghanistan.
[01:10:54.664 --> 01:11:05.353]  There's a section on the Beatles, and I'll explain how the Beatles, the Top 40 radio, the MTV, all that forms part of the Bilbo conspiracy to destroy the psyche of the human being.
[01:11:05.373 --> 01:11:07.855]  And there's a few other surprises along the way as well.
[01:11:08.995 --> 01:11:19.337]  What's your whole view on how the government is fomenting all these demonstrations and in some cases many riots with the illegal aliens rampaging all over the United States?
[01:11:19.377 --> 01:11:23.018]  I mean, I know you're over in Spain, but have you been watching that from afar and do you have a view on it?
[01:11:23.038 --> 01:11:26.659]  Well, I have, and as a matter of fact, you and I talked about it last year, the whole idea behind it.
[01:11:26.679 --> 01:11:30.900]  We talked about the Patriot Movement in the United States, and you're seeing the same thing going on in Spain.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.641]  As a matter of fact, something that I predicted last year, unfortunately 94% of all my predictions
[01:11:36.722 --> 01:11:42.285]  I really do mean unfortunately because I would like to be wrong on all accounts, but unfortunately I'm not.
[01:11:42.486 --> 01:11:47.970]  And one of the things I predicted last year was the idea behind the illegal immigrants.
[01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:55.075]  We need to get all these people from Africa, from Asia, and of course from Eastern Europe into Spain, France, etc.
[01:11:55.535 --> 01:11:59.558]  to dilute the population of the country for the purposes of destroying the Constitution.
[01:12:00.198 --> 01:12:15.686]  And a couple of weeks ago, the mayor of the province of Madrid, which would be like the governor of one of the United States, came out in public and said that she believes that it was necessary for the illegal immigrants to be able to vote in national elections.
[01:12:16.406 --> 01:12:18.908]  And it just happened that her name, she's
[01:12:19.648 --> 01:12:22.589]  Her name is Esperanza Aguirre and she was one of the bill numbers.
[01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:25.771]  She was invited to two of the billboard meetings over the last few years.
[01:12:26.151 --> 01:12:32.434]  She obviously understands the agenda behind it and what is going on in the United States with illegal immigrants.
[01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.870]  That's right.
[01:12:33.951 --> 01:12:39.315]  In fact, I'd forgotten about that, but a transcript and the audio of last year's interview, we have you on at least once a year.
[01:12:54.328 --> 01:13:00.229]  Is up there and you said that, and Tucker said he got this too, they're very upset about the Truth Movement or what they call the Patriots.
[01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:15.793]  They're very upset about how the, I mean they're actually talking about the Minute Minute Bilderberg folks, about how we're standing up because for globalism they've got to bring down national sovereignty and get groups inside the countries fighting with each other for divide and conquer and now that is happening.
[01:13:16.678 --> 01:13:27.258]  Well, they need to destroy, I think, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:13:34.152 --> 01:13:46.578]  What do you want to say to the useful idiot pawns, the tens of millions, it's really 25 million folks, illegal aliens running around saying that they're bringing America down and the media covers up for them.
[01:13:46.598 --> 01:13:49.760]  What do you want to say to those pawns who think they're going to get something out of this?
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:55.206]  Well, I don't really understand how, you know, why these people are having such a hard time getting their brains around this whole thing.
[01:13:55.286 --> 01:14:09.563]  Of course, in the United States, half of the population is literally brain-dead, which is the only way you can explain that these people are supporting the, you know, the correctness degenerate running the White House and that sack of s*** known as Vice President Biden.
[01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:16.806]  I know in Spain and in England you guys can talk like that.
[01:14:16.846 --> 01:14:17.666]  We can't do that here.
[01:14:19.887 --> 01:14:24.690]  I know in Europe they're not hung up on stuff like that, but we can't do that here.
[01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:29.573]  Listen, I understand you're upset, and so you've been researching really hard.
[01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:32.895]  Where do you think Bilderberg is going to be this year?
[01:14:32.915 --> 01:14:35.156]  I know it may be in the U.S., but do you think it's going to be in Europe?
[01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:36.737]  What do you think will be on the agenda?
[01:14:37.097 --> 01:14:41.884]  Well, I have a very, very good idea where these guys are going to be holding the 2006 meeting.
[01:14:42.245 --> 01:14:51.920]  I prefer not to reveal it right now, because what they have done for the first time, again, last year, the Mayer-Bildenberg Report, which is a very extensive report, extensively covered in many newspapers around the world,
[01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:57.893]  Did a lot of damage to these people because it was the first time that so much information has actually come out.
[01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:05.720]  So what they've done this year is they've booked three hotels and they blocked off three dates for each of the hotels, so that's nine possible dates.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.261]  I have a pretty good idea.
[01:15:07.281 --> 01:15:16.649]  As a matter of fact, I think we're going to be having it and exactly what dates, but I prefer to keep it secret for now and keep them guessing lest they wish to change the dates on us at the last minute.
[01:15:16.689 --> 01:15:18.070]  And I prefer for them not to do that.
[01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:27.702]  I believe you.
[01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:28.442]  Thank you so much.
[01:15:29.362 --> 01:15:37.563]  A lot goes into finding out where it's going to be and they go to greater and greater lengths now to hide where they're going to be meeting.
[01:15:37.844 --> 01:15:45.565]  Understand folks, the Washington Post is always represented there and they've written editorials 10 years ago, 15 years ago saying Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[01:15:46.207 --> 01:15:49.190]  And the person writing the articles has been there.
[01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:51.573]  Why do they want to keep this so secret, Daniel?
[01:15:51.953 --> 01:16:02.445]  Well, the BBC documentary, I don't know if you saw it or not, last year, shortly after my Bilderberg report came out, the BBC, which of course is owned by the British government, which of course Bill Blair and company are Bilderbergers,
[01:16:02.945 --> 01:16:03.765]  They had to come out.
[01:16:03.785 --> 01:16:04.685]  They would force their hand.
[01:16:04.725 --> 01:16:08.986]  And they had to come out and do a three-part radio documentary on secret societies.
[01:16:09.046 --> 01:16:14.868]  And they had people like Etienne D'Avignon, who was the president of the Bilderbergers and Kissinger and a few others come out and say, oh, these guys are insane.
[01:16:14.908 --> 01:16:15.228]  They're crazy.
[01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:16.948]  They're just conspiracy theorists.
[01:16:16.988 --> 01:16:18.108]  We're not conspiracy theorists.
[01:16:18.148 --> 01:16:20.189]  We don't deal in conspiracy theories.
[01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.349]  We deal in conspiracy facts.
[01:16:21.389 --> 01:16:31.051]  And the facts are undeniable that these people meet once a year during the course of three or four days to discuss and plan the agenda for that eventually, somehow,
[01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:35.558]  Over the next year, six months, a couple of years, come to the fore.
[01:16:35.899 --> 01:16:40.429]  And all this stuff is being planned very proactively at delivered meetings.
[01:16:42.248 --> 01:16:46.932]  What about these Degenerates plan, Shack of Maggots is what I call them.
[01:16:47.272 --> 01:16:50.894]  What about the, well that's mean to Maggots, I'm sorry, Shack of Demons.
[01:16:51.795 --> 01:16:53.837]  What do you think about what they're planning to do with Iran?
[01:16:53.857 --> 01:16:57.399]  I mean, there's certainly, all the documents we're getting is they do plan to hit them.
[01:16:57.439 --> 01:16:58.780]  What's your view on that?
[01:16:59.121 --> 01:17:00.281]  Is there a split in Bilderberg?
[01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:04.865]  Well, do you remember, again, from my last show, Bilderberg Report, I said that they actually had
[01:17:05.405 --> 01:17:10.951]  The date set and the whole thing was approved and they're actually discussing it in great detail at the Billabong meeting.
[01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:15.056]  The only thing that saved Iran from being attacked last year was everything.
[01:17:15.536 --> 01:17:21.602]  The forces of Katrina and Rita and the untimely illness of Sharon.
[01:17:21.643 --> 01:17:22.884]  Now I do mean untimely.
[01:17:24.369 --> 01:17:30.691]  He's a criminal and in conferences around Europe and around Spain when I say this, quite a few people raise their eyebrows saying, are you pro Sharon?
[01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:31.191]  No, I'm not.
[01:17:31.631 --> 01:17:33.252]  But Sharon, he's a general.
[01:17:33.272 --> 01:17:35.232]  I mean, he's an assassin, but he's also a general.
[01:17:35.252 --> 01:17:41.314]  And he knows what he's facing if he actually goes, if he actually went up against Iran.
[01:17:41.354 --> 01:17:42.015]  He's no fool.
[01:17:42.035 --> 01:17:49.157]  With Sharon out of the picture, these people, the United States with the chicken hawks, they really do not understand what they're going up against.
[01:17:49.944 --> 01:17:54.306]  And I am getting excellent intelligence on Iran.
[01:17:54.646 --> 01:18:00.648]  Have you read a book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a novel called Chronicle of a Death Foretold?
[01:18:00.988 --> 01:18:01.248]  Yes.
[01:18:01.948 --> 01:18:06.130]  It's a book for your listeners, for the audience.
[01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:12.192]  It's a book where virtually everyone in the small town of this man, the character by the name of Santiago Nassar, is going to be murdered.
[01:18:12.816 --> 01:18:18.081]  And yet nobody can or will do anything to prevent it, and the murder is motivated and inexorable.
[01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:23.206]  Yet no one quite knows why this man, which is a really rich young man, must die.
[01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:30.273]  And I think there's a very similar feeling of inevitability about Bush's desire to go to war with Iran.
[01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:31.855]  Do we have to do a commercial?
[01:18:31.955 --> 01:18:34.658]  Yes, a final segment with Daniel Esselstyn on the other side.
[01:18:35.603 --> 01:18:36.103]  And that's it.
[01:18:36.143 --> 01:18:37.504]  I mean, it's just inexorable.
[01:18:38.224 --> 01:18:52.168]  They just continually move towards the attack, the plan of attack, the strike, because they need to widen the global crisis so they can be our saviors and grandstand and we'll cuddle up next to them during the crises.
[01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.430]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.751]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.919 --> 01:19:08.811]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.031 --> 01:19:13.057]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.238 --> 01:19:16.583]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[01:19:16.983 --> 01:19:21.368]  We can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:21.768 --> 01:19:23.450]  Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:24.951]  For more information call 702-953-0267.
[01:19:24.971 --> 01:19:25.512]  That's 702-953-0267.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:37.705]  Or visit www.LazMedInc.com.
[01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:43.273]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[01:19:43.473 --> 01:19:45.095]  Or call LazMed at 702-953-0267 today.
[01:19:55.055 --> 01:19:56.097]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.497 --> 01:20:01.984]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:03.066]  That's right.
[01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:05.669]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:05.989 --> 01:20:13.159]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.695 --> 01:20:21.399]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:21.839 --> 01:20:26.642]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.302 --> 01:20:32.327]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:37.272]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:37.913]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:37.953 --> 01:20:39.835]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:39.915 --> 01:20:40.195]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.516 --> 01:20:40.776]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.328 --> 01:20:54.949]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:55.089 --> 01:20:59.172]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:02.194]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:21:02.294 --> 01:21:08.999]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:12.181]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:14.782]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:14.922 --> 01:21:22.808]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:21:23.508 --> 01:21:34.373]  Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:21:34.533 --> 01:21:42.296]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:21:53.334 --> 01:22:00.197]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:22:00.337 --> 01:22:13.263]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:22:13.443 --> 01:22:15.244]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:22:15.424 --> 01:22:18.886]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:22:19.166 --> 01:22:22.928]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:28.171]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:22:28.431 --> 01:22:30.152]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:34.374]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:22:34.634 --> 01:22:36.455]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:22:43.056 --> 01:22:43.977]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[01:22:44.057 --> 01:22:45.737]  A worldwide collision!
[01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:10.192]  A confrontation between the three peoples of the planet against the controlling New World Order scum.
[01:23:11.352 --> 01:23:17.114]  Totally ruthless, bloodthirsty, king rats that must be brought down if we're to live in peace.
[01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:21.835]  You'll always have corruption, you'll always have problems in human society, but it's waxing worse and worse.
[01:23:21.855 --> 01:23:27.516]  We're reaching a critical mass of corruption, and for every action, an equal or greater reaction, as I've always said.
[01:23:27.556 --> 01:23:30.736]  I couldn't believe it when he says that in V for Vendetta.
[01:23:30.897 --> 01:23:32.997]  We are the reaction to that, and we're going to win.
[01:23:33.846 --> 01:23:36.389]  Daniel Estelan, you know a lot of people believe we can't win.
[01:23:36.469 --> 01:23:40.894]  They get upset when I have successes and when I'm reaching out and when we're having victories.
[01:23:40.914 --> 01:23:42.716]  They think, how can this be happening?
[01:23:43.137 --> 01:23:44.658]  How can we be having victories?
[01:23:44.698 --> 01:23:46.380]  Because we have the people on our side.
[01:23:46.661 --> 01:23:49.203]  We have a lot of people in security services on our side.
[01:23:49.464 --> 01:23:50.945]  A lot of people in government on our side.
[01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:53.749]  All these top generals and people and founders of Delta Force.
[01:23:55.089 --> 01:23:57.090]  Others are going public agreeing with us.
[01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:59.350]  I mean, everybody isn't bad.
[01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:00.550]  We've got to have courage.
[01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:04.291]  Some of us have to have courage first and get others to go with us on this.
[01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.712]  I mean, your view on winning.
[01:24:05.992 --> 01:24:07.092]  Can we win, Daniel?
[01:24:07.532 --> 01:24:08.772]  Oh, absolutely we can win.
[01:24:08.952 --> 01:24:15.114]  For example, I have over 600 sources in the secret services around the world from the Mossad people to the MI6.
[01:24:16.054 --> 01:24:16.814]  We're good to go.
[01:24:34.219 --> 01:24:36.541]  You can see just from the results, astounding results.
[01:24:36.581 --> 01:24:38.302]  I mean, it's a Billboard Book of the Year.
[01:24:38.322 --> 01:24:45.447]  My book was nominated and won the award for the best non-fiction book in Canada by a prestigious independent newspaper.
[01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.948]  And I mean, I do mean independent newspaper.
[01:24:48.008 --> 01:24:53.372]  In Portugal, people forced the publisher to put the book back on the shelves and now it's sold out.
[01:24:53.432 --> 01:24:54.533]  Now it's in the second edition.
[01:24:54.753 --> 01:24:58.155]  By the way, Europe rejected EU expansion.
[01:24:58.495 --> 01:25:02.058]  The Pan-American Union failed in its expansion last year.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:11.306]  Absolutely, the window of opportunity is closing and I think what a lot of people don't understand is how is it that you and I can actually do this on the radio?
[01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:14.628]  How can a group of people get together and openly talk about the Bill of Rights?
[01:25:14.728 --> 01:25:16.129]  Yeah, they ask why are we still alive?
[01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:19.192]  Well, Bill of Rights is working on a systemic methodology.
[01:25:19.212 --> 01:25:22.654]  It means they don't need to control 6 billion people from around the world.
[01:25:22.674 --> 01:25:23.455]  What they need to do is
[01:25:23.895 --> 01:25:24.355]  We're good to go.
[01:25:43.427 --> 01:26:00.180]  They control the United Nations through Kofi Annan, who is of course, the reason that man got into the position he got into, is because he's married into the Wallenberg family, which is the most important and powerful Swedish family, and one of the key members of the Bilderberg Relief.
[01:26:00.501 --> 01:26:06.345]  So, all in all, there's probably about 50-60 thousand of them controlling 6 billion people, and that's what you need to do.
[01:26:06.365 --> 01:26:10.949]  You don't need to control an entire institution, just the top policy makers in each group.
[01:26:11.569 --> 01:26:21.756]  And what they're most afraid of is that all of us... See, they don't care if people stand up and start protesting gay rights, anti-gay rights, pro-family, anti-family abortion.
[01:26:22.016 --> 01:26:22.716]  They don't care about that.
[01:26:22.756 --> 01:26:31.082]  As long as all of us do not stand up and begin protesting against one common cause, that's when they get very, very scared because there are very, very few of them.
[01:26:31.102 --> 01:26:33.263]  So the idea is divide and conquer.
[01:26:33.303 --> 01:26:34.464]  And if we can stay the course,
[01:26:35.024 --> 01:26:44.287]  You can keep the eye on the prize, and the proverbial prize is the freedom, and that's what we're fighting for, and that's why I think you're doing a wonderful job, and it's great to have you fighting on our side.
[01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:53.229]  Well, Daniel, I want to get you on the show as soon as Bilderberg is over, and we're about to end our interview, but don't hang up as soon as we've got a break.
[01:26:53.249 --> 01:26:58.471]  I just want to talk to you off air for one minute, here in just a minute or two when this broadcast ends.
[01:26:59.543 --> 01:27:00.904]  I would very much like to see that.
[01:27:00.944 --> 01:27:02.524]  I hope it happens in my lifetime.
[01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:07.566]  I know definitely in Rockefeller's lifetime he's not going to see the Bilderbergers win.
[01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:24.886]  Exactly.
[01:27:25.326 --> 01:27:25.847]  They're losing.
[01:27:25.887 --> 01:27:27.668]  Their window is closing.
[01:27:28.028 --> 01:27:31.589]  They're like a race car that's got the pole positioned, but their engine's on fire.
[01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:33.470]  And they've got five laps to go.
[01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:34.550]  I don't think they can make it, Daniel.
[01:27:34.891 --> 01:27:37.772]  That's a good analogy, Alex.
[01:27:38.172 --> 01:27:40.153]  What do you think is going to happen in the next year in a nutshell?
[01:27:41.249 --> 01:27:46.871]  Well, I think oil, that's going to be the most important, it's always the most important area of discussion.
[01:27:47.271 --> 01:27:53.753]  We talked about it last year, I showed my Buildable report from 2005, that the price is going to go up to about $150-$200 a barrel.
[01:27:54.693 --> 01:27:59.895]  Just before the Buildable we were meeting in 2005 in Rotterheim, Germany, it was, I believe, at $41-$42.
[01:27:59.935 --> 01:28:04.336]  Then today, or yesterday, it went up to $69.7, which is $70.
[01:28:04.436 --> 01:28:05.576]  It's almost double the price.
[01:28:05.996 --> 01:28:10.958]  And again, it doesn't matter if there's plenty of oil, if we're running out of oil, what's called the peak oil phenomenon.
[01:28:11.338 --> 01:28:20.062]  The point is that you and I both agree that these people are trying to give the impression of scarcity of oil to get the power into fewer and fewer hands.
[01:28:22.890 --> 01:28:25.973]  We're going to see, that's going to be the principle behind it all.
[01:28:26.073 --> 01:28:31.517]  And of course, all the interventions, be it from Iran to Saudi Arabia, to the Emirates, Iraq, etc.
[01:28:31.658 --> 01:28:37.342]  All of that has to do with the oil control for the last remaining bits of oil.
[01:28:37.503 --> 01:28:38.003]  You're right.
[01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:39.604]  Daniel Aston, thanks for joining us.
[01:28:40.145 --> 01:28:40.765]  Thanks for having me.
[01:28:41.026 --> 01:28:41.326]  You bet.
[01:28:41.346 --> 01:28:42.006]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.868 --> 01:28:44.749]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:46.851]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.771 --> 01:28:50.454]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:12.181]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:14.262]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.522 --> 01:30:17.843]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.183 --> 01:30:28.626]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.926 --> 01:30:29.426]  That's right!
[01:30:29.606 --> 01:30:36.729]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.009 --> 01:30:41.130]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:31:06.508 --> 01:31:14.415]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.575 --> 01:31:21.621]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:21.821 --> 01:31:23.043]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:23.183 --> 01:31:26.587]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:26.627 --> 01:31:27.748]  Don't just treat symptoms.

[01:31:43.186 --> 01:31:46.109]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:47.391]  We're gonna have open phones!
[01:32:02.892 --> 01:32:06.073]  We've covered the news for the next hour, the last half of this hour, half of the next.
[01:32:06.093 --> 01:32:09.293]  I've got a guest coming on who writes for a mainstream news publication in Canada.
[01:32:10.094 --> 01:32:11.534]  Never has a story shot down.
[01:32:12.354 --> 01:32:14.054]  Went to the newspaper, stories are all over it.
[01:32:14.675 --> 01:32:18.895]  But he wrote one about Charlie Sheen in 9-11 and they said, no, no.
[01:32:19.896 --> 01:32:21.456]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:22.296 --> 01:32:24.717]  So only negative hit pieces in mainstream media.
[01:32:25.137 --> 01:32:30.438]  So we'll just, it's not just about Charlie Sheen, it's about a look into the control, a look into censorship.
[01:32:31.049 --> 01:32:31.449]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:31.469 --> 01:32:43.052]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to get involved on air and to join us.
[01:32:43.152 --> 01:32:45.912]  And boy, I've got a big stack of news here I haven't even scratched the surface of yet.
[01:32:45.932 --> 01:32:57.755]  I've already had two great guests on and covered several issues, and so anything you want to talk about, any news item, any discussion, if you disagree with me, agree with me, whatever, we're going to take some calls and get back into the news here right now.
[01:32:59.213 --> 01:33:02.939]  I do want to encourage all of you to cease the procrastination.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:11.612]  To go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to peruse the safe, secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:33:12.885 --> 01:33:16.948]  To look at all the 9-11 books and videos I carry that I haven't even produced.
[01:33:17.728 --> 01:33:23.651]  Or books about the war, books about the New World Order, books about the Illuminati and their bizarre activities.
[01:33:24.152 --> 01:33:25.733]  My new film, The Order of Death.
[01:33:25.773 --> 01:33:36.259]  When you get it, new footage inside Bohemian Grove, shot by an employee last year, inside the Idol up close, what the elites are doing, what the locals are up to, weird rituals we caught on tape there.
[01:33:37.708 --> 01:33:44.991]  And then, of course, another two-hour film, the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, updated, new information added.
[01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:47.292]  You get that absolutely free on the same DVD.
[01:33:47.712 --> 01:33:49.613]  Or, if you want it, we've got it in VHS, too.
[01:33:49.953 --> 01:33:54.315]  The Order of Death, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove Combo, $24.95.
[01:33:54.355 --> 01:33:56.876]  And then you get a second copy.
[01:33:58.277 --> 01:33:59.497]  There's a bunch of big discounts.
[01:33:59.798 --> 01:34:02.739]  We've got DVDs, films I've made as low as $5.95 apiece.
[01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:10.598]  As low as $5.95 apiece.
[01:34:12.359 --> 01:34:14.360]  You need to have these videos.
[01:34:15.081 --> 01:34:18.423]  You need to get them and burn copies of my films and get them out to people.
[01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:23.706]  We've got Dylan Avery's loose change second edition that has sent shockwaves across the nation.
[01:34:24.067 --> 01:34:24.767]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:34:25.928 --> 01:34:26.688]  When I was out in L.A.
[01:34:26.749 --> 01:34:32.112]  I'd be at the mall to see a movie on Sunday with my friend I was with.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:41.565]  We were, people coming up to him, people coming up to me, talking about my films, talking about Avery's film, talking, it was just so exciting.

[01:35:02.858 --> 01:35:05.860]  The point is, is that people are awake big time.
[01:35:06.401 --> 01:35:07.902]  Mui Grande Wake Up Call.

[01:36:59.867 --> 01:37:00.828]  My films, other films.
[01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:03.271]  You need to have books, books on tape.
[01:37:03.552 --> 01:37:05.394]  We have audio books that are excellent as well.
[01:37:05.714 --> 01:37:07.997]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWars.com.
[01:37:08.738 --> 01:37:11.261]  Alright, let's go ahead.
[01:37:12.942 --> 01:37:16.503]  And take some calls, Tony, in Arkansas.
[01:37:16.523 --> 01:37:17.644]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:37:18.044 --> 01:37:19.924]  Alex, blessing to talk with you always.
[01:37:20.204 --> 01:37:21.105]  Well, thank you for calling.
[01:37:21.325 --> 01:37:21.705]  Thank you.
[01:37:21.925 --> 01:37:24.166]  I had just a couple comments to acknowledge.
[01:37:24.246 --> 01:37:31.908]  I hope you guys are aware, you mention this often, but when you're making an impact, you know that by how the Emperor is moving his forces against you.
[01:37:32.606 --> 01:37:37.351]  And at first for the last, I've been awake for about two and a half years and you were a key element on that.
[01:37:37.411 --> 01:37:53.548]  If I could have this comment, give a shameless plug for it on your website because you're one of your, well if I could do it real fast, Prison Plant TV has been the force in me being able to wake up about 20 people within my family and friends and they listen like you said but until they see those videos, I just can't believe what you guys do with Prison Plant TV.
[01:37:53.908 --> 01:37:55.130]  But the main point is,
[01:37:56.559 --> 01:37:59.460]  The first was just a little Popular Mechanics hit piece, okay?
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.941]  That came out, you guys were making a wrinkle, you, the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:38:02.981 --> 01:38:15.025]  Yeah, Vanity Fair attacked me, American Legion Magazine attacked me, the New York Times, the Washington Post attacked me, and that didn't work, so then they launched all their paid bloggers, and some of them we know are on the payroll.
[01:38:15.325 --> 01:38:22.827]  Okay, but the ones that are now going massive mainstream are evidence that this is breaking through, and they're getting concerned.
[01:38:23.637 --> 01:38:29.139]  When Charlie came out, this is what I noticed, a week later, did you notice, of course, Moussaoui suddenly confesses.
[01:38:29.399 --> 01:38:35.281]  He had been holding off against admitting anything to the degree, and you guys had the information up that he had the belt on.
[01:38:35.581 --> 01:38:38.422]  He's up there totally saying, oh yeah, bin Laden gave us the order.
[01:38:39.022 --> 01:38:48.805]  And there's this, the flight 93 movie on cable came out, and then the massive new one that's going to be released in Hollywood on screens around the country.
[01:38:49.258 --> 01:38:50.441]  Uh, this is going to be Flight 93.
[01:38:50.741 --> 01:38:57.556]  But the thing that's disgusting that I cannot stand is if anybody's watching their news is going to be blasted on all day today is the supposed black box.
[01:38:58.123 --> 01:39:27.086]  recorder of Flight 93 with them breaking into the cabins now been aired to all these people and uh... it uh... first of all I can't stand it when I'm listening to it because they use the term once they break into the cockpit somebody they said says roll it well for the morons out there obviously they're going to stand there and go oh that's Todd Beamer oh that's Todd why would he say let's roll and then get in the cockpit and go roll it while he's in the middle of a struggle for his life it's all staged I mean fifteen years ago they could show
[01:39:27.975 --> 01:39:31.377]  Forrest Gump shaking hands with JFK.
[01:39:31.417 --> 01:39:33.378]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[01:39:33.758 --> 01:39:41.202]  We know their official story's a lie, so whatever perfume they put on it, you can't put perfume on a latrine.
[01:39:41.882 --> 01:39:44.664]  And it's just putting perfume on a bucket of bull.
[01:39:45.144 --> 01:39:45.544]  Amen.
[01:39:45.704 --> 01:39:50.807]  And I just guess what I wanted to say, though, as upsetting as this was, and I try to do everything I can to wake people up.
[01:39:51.187 --> 01:40:15.432]  Really it's optimistic because you guys are clearly they can see you're having an impact because they've got to now get it mainstreamed in and not in a direct way to acknowledge that you guys are there but in an indirect way to say look at all this evidence we've actually so anyway you guys God bless you keep it up Charlie Sheen all of you I mean George Nury you're having a major impact because the Emperor's having to move to the black the Empire's forces
[01:40:16.196 --> 01:40:19.260]  To at least acknowledge what you're doing is making inroads into America.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.161]  So thank you very much.
[01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:20.741]  Well, thank you.
[01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:21.782]  I appreciate the call, Tony.
[01:40:21.802 --> 01:40:24.225]  We're going to talk to Kevin and General Payne, Joe and others.
[01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.067]  Kevin in Alabama, you're on the air.
[01:40:26.107 --> 01:40:26.487]  Go ahead.
[01:40:26.507 --> 01:40:28.389]  Mr. Jones?
[01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:28.990]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:33.034]  I have a couple of things that... Sir?
[01:40:34.316 --> 01:40:34.656]  Yeah.
[01:40:34.956 --> 01:40:35.517]  Hi, Kevin.
[01:40:36.226 --> 01:40:36.746]  Can you hear me?
[01:40:37.167 --> 01:40:38.487]  I sure can, yeah.
[01:40:38.708 --> 01:40:43.671]  Alright, I have a couple of things that disturb me about Charlie Sheen coming out about 9-11.
[01:40:43.751 --> 01:40:52.496]  I have pictures of him at Globalist Elite meetings of him coming into them, so he's a part of the Illuminati.
[01:40:52.536 --> 01:40:56.639]  I also have a problem with the BYU professor.
[01:40:56.659 --> 01:41:03.463]  He is, uh, everybody knows about Mormons, Mr. Jones, so, I mean, would you like to address that?
[01:41:04.631 --> 01:41:05.512]  Just keep going, buddy.
[01:41:05.812 --> 01:41:06.513]  You've got your time.
[01:41:06.553 --> 01:41:08.034]  I'm going to comment on it, and then you're off the air.
[01:41:08.074 --> 01:41:08.454]  Go ahead.
[01:41:08.855 --> 01:41:09.295]  I'm done.
[01:41:09.315 --> 01:41:09.775]  That's all.
[01:41:10.035 --> 01:41:11.517]  Okay, I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[01:41:12.377 --> 01:41:16.621]  Kevin's called before, and he's always mad at me, and that's fine.
[01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:17.381]  We went to his call.
[01:41:19.303 --> 01:41:30.232]  Charlie Sheen knows Bill Clinton, and Charlie Sheen knows all these elites, and if you could only know Charlie Sheen like I know Charlie Sheen,
[01:41:32.058 --> 01:41:34.959]  I'm just not going to even sit here and talk about private stuff, okay?
[01:41:35.619 --> 01:41:44.902]  His whole family knows about everything, and they know all about vaccines, and they know all about the New World Order, and they know about all of it.
[01:41:45.163 --> 01:41:48.104]  And, you know, there's been a big wake-up call for liberals the last few years.
[01:41:48.624 --> 01:41:55.166]  I mean, George Clooney's calling Hillary Clinton horrible names in the press, okay?
[01:41:55.226 --> 01:41:58.187]  They've woken up, and
[01:41:59.469 --> 01:42:02.291]  You know, Martin Sheen's out there protesting Abu Ghraib.
[01:42:02.311 --> 01:42:03.912]  He's out there protesting Camp X-Ray.
[01:42:04.272 --> 01:42:05.113]  They're out there doing that.
[01:42:05.133 --> 01:42:07.174]  They do things in charity you don't even know about.
[01:42:07.674 --> 01:42:10.596]  And so you say you've got pictures of him going into elite meetings.
[01:42:10.636 --> 01:42:12.117]  I don't know what that means.
[01:42:12.718 --> 01:42:16.940]  I know they've been to the White House and stuff, or been at Democratic events, you know, ten years ago.
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:20.342]  Whatever, but I don't really understand what you're even talking about.
[01:42:21.103 --> 01:42:23.444]  I mean, Charlie Sheen made a bold statement.
[01:42:24.025 --> 01:42:25.325]  He's taken a lot of risk.
[01:42:25.365 --> 01:42:27.587]  If you only knew, you just have no idea.
[01:42:28.584 --> 01:42:30.804]  I was just out in California for three and a half days.
[01:42:31.165 --> 01:42:32.805]  That's all I'm going to say.
[01:42:32.845 --> 01:42:37.086]  You have no idea how serious all of this is.
[01:42:41.087 --> 01:42:42.067]  It's just frustrating.
[01:42:42.087 --> 01:42:53.569]  It is so incredibly frustrating that as we start winning, as we start having an effect, we're here to win.
[01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:54.949]  We're here to get people to join us.
[01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:58.230]  You freak out and go wild.
[01:42:59.401 --> 01:43:00.182]  I'm not a Mormon.
[01:43:01.943 --> 01:43:05.986]  And there's a difference between your mainline Mormons and your temple Mormons.
[01:43:07.126 --> 01:43:08.847]  There's a group of Mormons above those Mormons.
[01:43:09.868 --> 01:43:21.056]  And I'm not here, this is not a religious broadcast, I'm not here to attack the Mormons, the Protestants, the Catholics, the whatever.
[01:43:21.676 --> 01:43:25.118]  I do not agree with the doctrine, and now they'll have Mormons calling now to attack me.
[01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:26.339]  I don't agree with that doctrine.
[01:43:26.359 --> 01:43:27.380]  I don't agree with what's going on.
[01:43:28.247 --> 01:43:32.949]  I don't agree with the fact that Orrin Hatch is supposedly a conservative Mormon, and look at all the stuff he pushes for.
[01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:42.194]  But there are a hundred other shows that talk about this and cover this, and they don't have a lot of listeners because people just get sick of it, all this sectarian fighting.
[01:43:44.355 --> 01:43:50.058]  I don't even know, is Dr. Stephen Jones a professor of Jones?
[01:43:50.638 --> 01:43:51.199]  Is he a Mormon?
[01:43:51.279 --> 01:43:51.919]  I mean, so what?
[01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:58.062]  The guy's gone public and talking about how the towers were... I mean, let's go find out what Kevin Ryan is.
[01:43:58.102 --> 01:43:59.003]  The Underwriter Laboratory.
[01:43:59.023 --> 01:43:59.523]  I never found out.
[01:43:59.903 --> 01:44:01.743]  Maybe he's not a Christian.
[01:44:01.763 --> 01:44:02.564]  Maybe he's a Mormon.
[01:44:02.604 --> 01:44:05.765]  Maybe he's a Zoroastrian.
[01:44:06.305 --> 01:44:07.065]  Maybe he's a Buddhist.
[01:44:07.185 --> 01:44:08.625]  I don't know what Kevin Ryan is.
[01:44:09.165 --> 01:44:10.906]  But he underwrote the towers.
[01:44:11.969 --> 01:44:15.332]  And then they went and did structural steel tests and said it's impossible what happened.
[01:44:15.572 --> 01:44:20.617]  So instead of him getting fired because the results came out, they said, yeah, just keep quiet about these.
[01:44:20.977 --> 01:44:23.319]  Then he went public saying something's wrong here valiantly.
[01:44:23.579 --> 01:44:24.360]  He lost his job.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.180]  He's been blackballed.
[01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:26.161]  Been threatened.
[01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:27.142]  A bunch of other stuff happened.
[01:44:27.542 --> 01:44:29.224]  But let's not focus on his courage.
[01:44:30.245 --> 01:44:33.708]  Let's go find out what Kevin Ryan's up to.
[01:44:33.748 --> 01:44:35.129]  Let's go find out about Morgan Reynolds.
[01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:39.653]  Let's go find out about all these other people.
[01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:42.978]  I mean, they're definitely doing it for the right reason.
[01:44:43.018 --> 01:44:44.738]  They're definitely pointing us in the right direction.
[01:44:45.398 --> 01:44:46.959]  I mean, let's go find out about Michael Meacher.
[01:44:46.979 --> 01:44:48.760]  Let's go find out about Andre Frambulo's background.
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:50.480]  Let's go find out about Ron Paul's background.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.661]  Let's go find out about Cynthia McKinney's background.
[01:44:52.701 --> 01:44:55.462]  Or let's focus on her shoving a cop that grabbed her.
[01:44:55.942 --> 01:44:57.042]  Instinctively off of her.
[01:44:57.082 --> 01:44:57.502]  Big deal.
[01:44:57.522 --> 01:45:00.003]  You know, it's always a distraction.
[01:45:00.083 --> 01:45:01.384]  It's always a diversion.
[01:45:01.464 --> 01:45:04.985]  It's always how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
[01:45:06.905 --> 01:45:08.986]  And, you know, you look at people in the arena
[01:45:10.469 --> 01:45:16.859]  What I had to love was people emailing me and posting and saying, why isn't Charlie Sheen in front of the White House right now?
[01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:23.910]  Why isn't Charlie Sheen, uh, you know, why aren't you leading a protest in front of Building 7 right now?
[01:45:24.907 --> 01:45:37.215]  Well, there have been those, and I have been there, and I have been there and protested with a video camera, and had cops threaten to arrest me, and given speeches there, and then made a film so you can see it, where, you know, protesting is like a thousand-year-old technology.
[01:45:37.916 --> 01:45:41.858]  Five-thousand-year-old technology of the pen being mightier than the sword.
[01:45:42.058 --> 01:45:43.339]  What do you think videos and books are?
[01:45:43.359 --> 01:45:44.940]  What do you think this radio show is?
[01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:48.442]  People always say, come speak to our group of five hundred, we'll pay you.
[01:45:48.903 --> 01:45:50.624]  You know, come fly out here and do this, do that.
[01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:58.634]  I don't do a lot of that because I go, wait a minute, I can stay home, do my own radio show, and do 20 radio interviews this week, and talk to 10 million people.
[01:45:59.275 --> 01:46:08.947]  Or I can go talk to 500 and get that primitive monkey feeling that so many people get addicted to, so many in the Patriot movement, who salivate of getting up in front of a crowd.
[01:46:09.938 --> 01:46:11.519]  Because it's that primitive connection.
[01:46:11.559 --> 01:46:13.861]  It's being, you know, I'm the leader monkey.
[01:46:14.862 --> 01:46:16.303]  Believe me folks, I'm not into being a leader.
[01:46:16.363 --> 01:46:19.866]  I'm not into being adored and into all of this.
[01:46:19.986 --> 01:46:21.507]  I'm into getting you to take action.
[01:46:21.547 --> 01:46:23.049]  I'm into getting others to take action.
[01:46:23.489 --> 01:46:33.117]  When I get some heavy to go public, and there's a lot of other big heavies that we're very close to getting to go public, and they're watching what happens with Charlie because he hit the barbed wire first.
[01:46:33.817 --> 01:46:39.342]  And regardless of what you think of these big people in Hollywood or in music or in whatever, people do pay attention to them.
[01:46:41.150 --> 01:46:42.291]  And so they're watching this.
[01:46:42.991 --> 01:46:46.212]  And I have no doubt that it'll be the little COINTELPRO operatives that attack them.
[01:46:46.452 --> 01:46:48.533]  And of course, I'm not saying you're a COINTELPRO, sir.
[01:46:49.033 --> 01:46:51.514]  What happens is that it's a snowball.
[01:46:51.554 --> 01:46:55.035]  They've got a few paid blogs and a few paid groups.
[01:46:55.115 --> 01:46:58.036]  They first quack it out, and then you parrot it.
[01:47:02.257 --> 01:47:04.518]  It's like the thief hanging next to Christ.
[01:47:05.174 --> 01:47:08.457]  And the other people are laughing at him that are on their crosses, saying mean things to him.
[01:47:08.497 --> 01:47:12.260]  And the thief says, you know, how can I be with you?
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.361]  How can I repent?
[01:47:13.401 --> 01:47:14.302]  How can I be led into?
[01:47:14.923 --> 01:47:18.266]  And he just said, well, I mean, you've done it.
[01:47:18.386 --> 01:47:19.286]  Tonight you'll be with me.
[01:47:19.367 --> 01:47:20.608]  Today you'll be with me in paradise.
[01:47:21.448 --> 01:47:25.492]  I mean, so, so, I mean, look at who Christ was out there working with.
[01:47:26.275 --> 01:47:31.499]  Look at who, he was with the prostitutes, and he was with the tax collectors, and he was with the cops.
[01:47:31.999 --> 01:47:33.160]  Now who did God choose?
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:37.302]  Saul of Tarsus, this guy who tortured and murdered and killed Christians.
[01:47:37.843 --> 01:47:42.566]  And God knocked him off his horse, and knocked him down in the ditch, and took him.
[01:47:43.526 --> 01:47:50.651]  And then as you see people getting knocked off their horses in every, you know, way, and then you get mad when they get knocked off their horse.
[01:47:51.292 --> 01:47:54.834]  And I think it's because, when they join us, because
[01:47:56.525 --> 01:47:59.187]  There's certain people, it's kind of cliquish, it's elitist.
[01:47:59.267 --> 01:48:11.334]  No, no, we go to our little meetings, five of us, and we've got all the answers, and we're going to lose, and we're losers, and there's nothing we can do, and anybody who's successful is bad.
[01:48:12.274 --> 01:48:24.121]  Because there is a certain element, it's a small minority of this movement, who aren't agents, who aren't paid bloggers, there's a lot of those too, but that's still a minority, who just are mad at life, who are negative.
[01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:27.345]  Negative in the wrong aspects.
[01:48:27.385 --> 01:48:29.046]  Who don't believe they can affect change.
[01:48:29.066 --> 01:48:30.528]  Who don't believe they can get involved.
[01:48:30.848 --> 01:48:32.529]  Who don't believe they can ever do anything.
[01:48:32.549 --> 01:48:34.431]  And who are mad at life and mad at everything.
[01:48:35.311 --> 01:48:36.332]  And never been successful.
[01:48:36.873 --> 01:48:40.235]  So it's just hating the New World Order is an extension of that.
[01:48:40.856 --> 01:48:41.556]  I'm here to win.
[01:48:41.576 --> 01:48:43.278]  We're going to come back and talk to General Payne.
[01:48:43.318 --> 01:48:44.299]  Please hold from England.
[01:48:44.359 --> 01:48:46.160]  I want to see who would call themselves General Payne.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.021]  Maybe he really is a general.
[01:48:47.041 --> 01:48:48.282]  Or maybe that's a nickname.
[01:48:49.207 --> 01:48:50.087]  I'm like a pro wrestler.
[01:48:50.127 --> 01:48:57.630]  But seriously, General Payne, we'll go right to you after this quick break, and then Joe and others, and continue with your calls and a bunch of news into the next hour.
[01:48:57.710 --> 01:49:00.971]  But we need to encourage people that go public.
[01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:03.652]  I mean, Charlie Sheen did good things.
[01:49:03.672 --> 01:49:04.252]  Look at the fruits.
[01:49:04.332 --> 01:49:05.393]  He woke a lot of people up.
[01:49:05.713 --> 01:49:09.174]  He pushed the 9-11 movement over the edge to a whole new level.
[01:49:09.214 --> 01:49:11.315]  I mean, it really came at the right time.
[01:49:11.815 --> 01:49:12.935]  We already had a lot of momentum.
[01:49:12.955 --> 01:49:14.676]  We're growing, but it just really grew.
[01:49:14.756 --> 01:49:15.316]  It ballooned.
[01:49:16.076 --> 01:49:16.636]  Look at the fruits.
[01:49:16.836 --> 01:49:17.196]  Test it.
[01:49:18.177 --> 01:49:18.497]  It's good.
[01:49:19.167 --> 01:49:19.847]  It's very good.
[01:49:20.908 --> 01:49:22.048]  And that's who God uses.
[01:49:22.628 --> 01:49:24.109]  He doesn't use perfect people.
[01:49:24.129 --> 01:49:25.930]  In fact, none of us are perfect.
[01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:32.612]  So get the stick out of your own eye before you tell us to get the beams out of our eyes.
[01:49:32.772 --> 01:49:34.413]  Believe me, I know I got beams in my eyes.
[01:49:34.553 --> 01:49:34.853]  Okay?
[01:49:35.493 --> 01:49:35.953]  Believe me.
[01:49:37.854 --> 01:49:38.955]  But, you know, God used me.
[01:49:39.215 --> 01:49:40.535]  I'm not a naive person.
[01:49:40.955 --> 01:49:42.116]  I'm a pretty mean person.
[01:49:42.436 --> 01:49:44.017]  I've been a very worldly person.
[01:49:45.577 --> 01:49:47.578]  But I know who I work for.
[01:49:49.073 --> 01:49:50.114]  And he isn't on this planet.
[01:49:54.799 --> 01:49:57.641]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.902 --> 01:49:59.483]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.824 --> 01:50:04.508]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.848 --> 01:50:11.575]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.895 --> 01:50:13.877]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.077 --> 01:50:16.899]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.019 --> 01:50:21.683]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.883 --> 01:50:26.286]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.527 --> 01:50:33.752]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.013 --> 01:50:36.434]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:55.807 --> 01:51:06.531]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:06.891 --> 01:51:11.413]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.493 --> 01:51:22.817]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.417 --> 01:51:30.262]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:30.642 --> 01:51:32.784]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:33.284 --> 01:51:38.267]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.

[01:51:52.777 --> 01:51:53.397]  I think so.
[01:52:10.885 --> 01:52:11.545]  We're good to go.

[01:53:01.864 --> 01:53:08.888]  Welcome back, as we wage war on corruption as we crash through the lies and disinformation.
[01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:24.498]  Information kamikazes, smashing every millisecond into their flagships of propaganda, laying waste to the New World Order's great design.
[01:53:25.185 --> 01:53:27.526]  Good afternoon, good morning, good evening, Alex.
[01:53:28.086 --> 01:53:37.251]  I do want to say, first of all, before I hit off on the actual topic I wanted to speak about, I've got my martial law.
[01:53:53.857 --> 01:53:57.360]  And Order of Death and Codex Magicka.
[01:53:58.121 --> 01:54:04.667]  And I think everybody should at least invest in martial law at a minimum.
[01:54:04.727 --> 01:54:06.629]  The Puppet Show, the puppet segment.
[01:54:06.649 --> 01:54:08.390]  Do you remember the little puppet?
[01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:09.992]  Yeah, I did that with the puppet, yeah.
[01:54:10.212 --> 01:54:10.992]  It was you, wasn't it?
[01:54:11.413 --> 01:54:11.833]  Yeah, it was me.
[01:54:11.853 --> 01:54:12.394]  It was brilliant.
[01:54:14.075 --> 01:54:15.096]  Loved it, I loved it.
[01:54:15.116 --> 01:54:18.079]  Well, a lady had a puppet out on the street of George Bush
[01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:20.679]  And, uh, and I did it in one take.
[01:54:20.779 --> 01:54:25.620]  I said, uh, I said, just, uh, move his hands along with me, and we just did that outside a restaurant, yeah.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.240]  It was fantastic.
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.521]  Oh, I love the New World Order!
[01:54:29.561 --> 01:54:30.201]  Yeah!
[01:54:32.082 --> 01:54:39.724]  Sorry, sorry, I'm excited, like, uh, and, uh, the Michael Moore, um, interview that he didn't want to give, it's, um, it's the American Way or something like that.
[01:54:39.804 --> 01:54:40.664]  What are you talking about?
[01:54:41.164 --> 01:54:43.965]  And, uh, David Gergen, we know that's a classic right there.
[01:54:43.985 --> 01:54:46.086]  He wanted to fight you!
[01:54:48.155 --> 01:54:51.919]  I mean, when you stood up to him, like, yeah, and what, you know, he's like, he's back and down.
[01:54:51.959 --> 01:55:02.731]  But, um... This week, I walked into this big Hollywood house, and there's all these Hollywood bigwigs sitting around waiting for me to arrive, and, uh, and guess what's on the big screen TV?
[01:55:02.852 --> 01:55:05.354]  Martial Law, right at the David Gergen part.
[01:55:05.414 --> 01:55:06.115]  That was fun.
[01:55:06.616 --> 01:55:06.896]  Really?
[01:55:07.176 --> 01:55:08.398]  Yeah, it was... Yo, Martial Law!
[01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:23.928]  Sure, yeah, I mean I was already there with somebody and he took me over to somebody else's house and I walk in the door and there's a stack of my videos on the table and there's all these people sitting on these couches watching the biggest big screen TV you've ever seen unless it was hanging in Times Square with martial law on it.
[01:55:24.609 --> 01:55:24.989]  Oh dear.
[01:55:25.249 --> 01:55:27.190]  So the point is the word's out, but go ahead.
[01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:30.712]  Yes, we're winning.
[01:55:31.752 --> 01:55:33.193]  We are definitely winning.
[01:55:34.116 --> 01:55:39.319]  And I think the reason why, in my opinion, for what it's worth, Berlusconi's got a problem.
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:51.567]  Because they shot an Italian, tried to shoot an Italian, this is my assumption, they tried to shoot an Italian journalist and they murdered the bodyguard.
[01:55:52.187 --> 01:55:56.710]  And they were arrogant with the Italians who were part of the coalition.
[01:55:56.890 --> 01:55:59.852]  You're talking about right outside the Baghdad airport?
[01:56:00.213 --> 01:56:00.793]  That's right.
[01:56:01.522 --> 01:56:08.384]  He therefore, or they would say... And now he's been kicked out of office, and now he's disputing the last election they had.
[01:56:08.404 --> 01:56:08.725]  Go ahead.
[01:56:08.885 --> 01:56:12.446]  Well he is, because in retaliation, the R.I.D.E.
[01:56:12.506 --> 01:56:15.167]  video came out about people shooting people.
[01:56:16.267 --> 01:56:19.949]  You know, I think it was the one where they were driving around to the Elvis Presley music?
[01:56:20.269 --> 01:56:23.650]  Yeah, just a private contractor just killing innocent people for fun, yeah.
[01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:26.791]  Yeah, and it came for the Italians, so I think it's just revenge.
[01:56:27.449 --> 01:56:35.114]  And right now, he's lost the election, but they're squabbling behind the scenes to see if he can get back in and whatever.
[01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:41.357]  And they've got that Mafia guy in Sicily, who probably was a friend of Berlusconi's anyway, so it's just a warning, you know?
[01:56:41.858 --> 01:56:42.118]  Exactly.
[01:56:42.178 --> 01:56:43.579]  That's my opinion, for what it's worth.
[01:56:44.379 --> 01:56:53.865]  Paul, sorry Alex, don't want me to take too much of your show off, your show off, show up, but Paul said something, and I thought, well let me just say something about
[01:56:54.457 --> 01:56:56.618]  There, and then I'll leave you to get on with your show.
[01:56:56.678 --> 01:57:00.359]  And it was to do with the, um... The Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:02.979 --> 01:57:04.179]  Hang on.
[01:57:04.219 --> 01:57:04.940]  I've wrote some notes.
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:05.720]  So many notes here.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:06.740]  I know, I understand.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.540]  We're almost out of time.
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.341]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:57:09.341 --> 01:57:10.001]  I better leave it.
[01:57:10.481 --> 01:57:13.582]  I really wanted to say something, but, uh... You're rapid.
[01:57:13.902 --> 01:57:14.602]  You're doing alright.
[01:57:14.902 --> 01:57:16.022]  Don't worry about anybody else.
[01:57:17.223 --> 01:57:19.883]  You're waking up people all the time.
[01:57:20.063 --> 01:57:22.104]  We get you over here in the UK from time to time.
[01:57:22.617 --> 01:57:23.677]  And, uh, don't worry about it.
[01:57:23.697 --> 01:57:24.278]  It's all good.
[01:57:24.298 --> 01:57:25.878]  Just keep going on and do what you do.
[01:57:26.338 --> 01:57:26.918]  I will, sir.
[01:57:26.938 --> 01:57:29.019]  Thanks to people like you out there supporting us.
[01:57:29.699 --> 01:57:31.260]  Alright, third hour coming up.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:32.580]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:37.321]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.341 --> 01:57:37.762]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.782 --> 01:57:38.142]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.877 --> 01:57:53.978]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.638 --> 01:57:55.459]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.219 --> 01:57:57.140]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:01.723]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.963 --> 01:58:06.106]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.892 --> 01:58:16.652]  Welcome back.
[01:58:17.913 --> 01:58:20.795]  Now into our number two.
[01:58:21.858 --> 01:58:22.459]  Of number three.
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.021]  It's our three.
[01:58:25.041 --> 01:58:28.283]  But we're going to have our third guest coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[01:58:28.964 --> 01:58:31.246]  I was here getting distracted looking through all these news items.
[01:58:32.086 --> 01:58:33.527]  What do I want to get into first?
[01:58:33.948 --> 01:58:35.709]  Look at this headline out of the Associated Press.
[01:58:36.250 --> 01:58:40.133]  Federal lawyers try to seize gold caps from drug suspects' teeth.
[01:58:41.234 --> 01:58:42.134]  Suspects' teeth.
[01:58:42.154 --> 01:58:47.178]  See, if you have asset forfeiture seizure, they just take everything you've got without even having evidence or trial.
[01:58:47.559 --> 01:58:49.040]  Now they want your gold teeth.
[01:58:49.890 --> 01:58:54.092]  You know, to keep you from having to have your teeth removed, because you pull one of those gold caps off.
[01:58:54.553 --> 01:58:56.014]  My daddy's a dentist, I know this.
[01:58:56.034 --> 01:59:05.119]  Then you're going to have the exposed nerve, or if it's been a root canal, just the dead tooth itself, and you're going to get an infection very quickly and have to have that tooth removed.
[01:59:06.099 --> 01:59:07.580]  We've entered insane land here.
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:09.141]  A lot of other news.
[01:59:09.181 --> 01:59:11.042]  I want to go into the situation with Iran.
[01:59:11.062 --> 01:59:13.023]  They're planning to hit Iran with nukes.
[01:59:13.063 --> 01:59:17.866]  I want to get into the illegal aliens rampaging around, the media cover-up of what's really going on.
[01:59:18.573 --> 01:59:21.295]  And I want to get into just so much more.
[01:59:21.335 --> 01:59:29.022]  The Bush leak and saying he's above the law and allowed to burn people in the CIA, allowed to commit felonies in front of everyone.
[01:59:29.082 --> 01:59:30.083]  So that's all coming up.
[01:59:30.143 --> 01:59:31.664]  And we do have another guest here in 30 minutes.
[01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:36.809]  So right now, let's get the rest of these calls, these great callers, out of the way.
[01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:39.792]  Let's talk to JoJo in Pennsylvania.
[01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:40.973]  JoJo, you're on the air.
[01:59:41.013 --> 01:59:41.313]  Go ahead.
[01:59:41.972 --> 01:59:43.493]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:59:43.913 --> 01:59:44.273]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:44.613 --> 01:59:52.296]  You reported a story last week that I think you kind of slid over a little too quick after I started to think about it.
[01:59:52.736 --> 01:59:54.197]  And that's the Vegas bomb.
[01:59:55.837 --> 01:59:56.537]  You know, the test?
[01:59:57.078 --> 01:59:58.758]  Oh, the thing they want to have out?
[01:59:58.818 --> 02:00:03.480]  The giant, huge bomb that's going to make the mushroom cloud.
[02:00:04.286 --> 02:00:05.947]  Yeah, it's a conventional thing.
[02:00:05.987 --> 02:00:07.087]  What is it?
[02:00:07.487 --> 02:00:08.387]  70,000 pounds or something?
[02:00:08.427 --> 02:00:09.888]  Well, that's... it's huge.
[02:00:10.128 --> 02:00:15.150]  I really don't... I know it's... I thought it was like at least 70,000 pounds.
[02:00:15.210 --> 02:00:18.531]  Yeah, the headline was... And it's a bunker buster.
[02:00:18.751 --> 02:00:21.552]  Yeah, it's a 70,000 pound mega bomb.
[02:00:21.572 --> 02:00:23.993]  They're going to test outside Las Vegas.
[02:00:24.413 --> 02:00:26.714]  And they were saying a huge cloud will cover the city.
[02:00:27.454 --> 02:00:32.196]  And I think it's supposed to be a bunker buster.
[02:00:32.796 --> 02:00:33.076]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:33.116 --> 02:00:33.296]  I know.
[02:00:33.777 --> 02:00:38.358]  And they're made out of depleted uranium to get penetration.
[02:00:39.639 --> 02:00:43.400]  Yeah, but that's the smaller... we have diagrams of them up on the website.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.681]  That's a small ship-fired or plane-fired missile.
[02:00:47.161 --> 02:00:52.042]  It's not some mega-bomb, you know, sheer firepower.
[02:00:53.202 --> 02:01:02.425]  The Bunkerbusters have conventional munitions and then they have... Well, they dropped the ones when they were going after Saddam in that house.
[02:01:02.970 --> 02:01:07.092]  Yeah, they dropped a bunker buster on him out of a plane.
[02:01:07.112 --> 02:01:07.592]  Yeah.
[02:01:08.872 --> 02:01:10.273]  That was only like 50,000 pounds.
[02:01:10.553 --> 02:01:10.793]  Right.
[02:01:10.993 --> 02:01:21.197]  The point I'm trying to make is that if this is a bunker buster, I'm wondering about the likelihood of it being a DU munition, and they're not saying it.
[02:01:21.737 --> 02:01:25.579]  And I'm wondering if DU is going to be in that cloud.
[02:01:26.849 --> 02:01:27.709]  Well, I know this, sir.
[02:01:27.769 --> 02:01:30.371]  There's ten proving grounds in the continental United States.
[02:01:30.411 --> 02:01:37.134]  There was one, of course, in one of our possessions, Puerto Rico, but that got shut down from protest.
[02:01:37.654 --> 02:01:39.115]  But I really don't know what to say.
[02:01:39.255 --> 02:01:39.515]  I mean...
[02:01:40.529 --> 02:01:41.250]  Well, I'm going to.
[02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:42.351]  They're already using it.
[02:01:42.371 --> 02:01:44.393]  I mean, you're speculating, which is fine.
[02:01:44.433 --> 02:01:45.674]  I think it's an important question.
[02:01:46.174 --> 02:01:50.218]  But what I'm telling you is that they're already doing it.
[02:01:50.578 --> 02:01:51.018]  Yeah, I know.
[02:01:51.059 --> 02:01:54.001]  I'm just saying that, you know, fuel on the fire.
[02:01:54.021 --> 02:01:57.845]  Generally, sir, a DU munition is non-explosive.
[02:01:58.405 --> 02:01:59.206]  It is solid.
[02:01:59.826 --> 02:02:01.528]  In fact, I don't even want to say generally.
[02:02:03.269 --> 02:02:06.793]  I mean, little three-pound shells
[02:02:07.934 --> 02:02:13.998]  Or projectiles that are fired out of the Vulcan cannon on an A-10 Warthog.
[02:02:14.318 --> 02:02:15.219]  There's footage of this.
[02:02:15.259 --> 02:02:17.160]  It will knock an entire tank over.
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:28.687]  The kinetic energy of the acceleration and the impact of that actually knocks giant, what, 50-ton tanks over on their sides.
[02:02:29.128 --> 02:02:29.468]  Oh, really?
[02:02:29.708 --> 02:02:30.789]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:31.029 --> 02:02:32.750]  So, DU by its very nature
[02:02:34.768 --> 02:02:36.490]  Bunker Busters, by their very nature.
[02:02:36.690 --> 02:02:37.491]  Well, there's different types.
[02:02:37.551 --> 02:02:40.794]  Let me just briefly... I'm no munitions expert, but I know more than most.
[02:02:41.254 --> 02:02:44.417]  So, if you really want to, I'll try to get my thoughts together and comment on it.
[02:02:46.339 --> 02:02:49.222]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.933 --> 02:02:51.215]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.415 --> 02:02:57.163]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.443 --> 02:03:02.710]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:02.991 --> 02:03:04.613]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[02:03:04.773 --> 02:03:07.154]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.294 --> 02:03:11.076]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.336 --> 02:03:15.979]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.079 --> 02:03:18.840]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:22.322]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much much more.
[02:03:22.362 --> 02:03:24.203]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:03:24.683 --> 02:03:26.765]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[02:03:42.419 --> 02:03:44.521]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:47.205 --> 02:03:48.245]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.565 --> 02:03:51.346]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.627 --> 02:03:55.768]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.208 --> 02:03:57.028]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.348 --> 02:04:01.910]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.406 --> 02:04:04.527]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:50.344]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[02:04:50.384 --> 02:04:51.445]  have diabetes.
[02:04:51.465 --> 02:04:58.390]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:04:58.550 --> 02:05:03.074]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:05:03.274 --> 02:05:06.096]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[02:05:53.453 --> 02:05:54.554]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.234 --> 02:05:56.034]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.794 --> 02:05:57.674]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.694 --> 02:06:02.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.536 --> 02:06:06.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.097 --> 02:06:12.098]  We've known it for a long time, but the drug companies have been caught red-handed.
[02:06:13.744 --> 02:06:16.507]  Inventing new diseases simply to drug the population.
[02:06:16.567 --> 02:06:17.789]  Times of London, we'll get into that.
[02:06:17.809 --> 02:06:19.491]  A lot of other scary stuff.
[02:06:19.511 --> 02:06:20.592]  We've got a guest coming up too.
[02:06:20.612 --> 02:06:25.598]  We'll take a few more calls before we run out of time and have some time to cover some of that news.
[02:06:26.138 --> 02:06:29.042]  But a caller in the last segment, in case you missed it, asked a question.
[02:06:29.903 --> 02:06:30.864]  He said they're going to test this
[02:06:31.942 --> 02:06:39.426]  70,000 pound bomb out in the desert and then there's a bunch of state senators and even U.S.
[02:06:40.026 --> 02:06:45.569]  senators and congressmen complaining that it's going to cover Las Vegas in a cloud of dust and other nearby cities.
[02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:49.231]  And the caller said, could there be DU in this bomb?
[02:06:50.011 --> 02:06:59.216]  When you have a raw explosive device where they're trying to cause the damage with an explosive, that's completely separate.
[02:06:59.376 --> 02:07:01.137]  So I wouldn't imagine DU would be involved.
[02:07:02.121 --> 02:07:03.282]  From de-munitions.
[02:07:03.322 --> 02:07:10.349]  A de-munition, say fired an anti-tank weapon, fired from an A-10 out of its Gatling gun called the Vulcan Cannon.
[02:07:10.949 --> 02:07:19.096]  I mean, one three-pound shell fired from it, one three-pound projectile, doesn't just hit the tank, it hits it on the side, it knocks the tank over.
[02:07:20.097 --> 02:07:26.583]  Okay, it's that incredible mass of that uranium hitting the tank and then so much energy is dissipated
[02:07:27.997 --> 02:07:33.060]  Uh, that it just destroys the tank and everybody inside and turns into powder.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.441]  The shell does.
[02:07:35.201 --> 02:07:54.174]  So that's different than, you know, those huge multi-ton bombs they drop out of the back of C-130s on people that just have a huge explosive charge in them that, you know, blows up a square mile and kills everybody.
[02:07:54.714 --> 02:07:56.936]  Or sucks the air out of their lungs deep inside bunkers.
[02:07:57.538 --> 02:07:59.578]  So it's separate.
[02:07:59.618 --> 02:08:08.000]  But if you want to talk about DU in America, there are 10 known proving grounds where they've used tons and tons of this, and it's all over the place, and it's very bad for us.
[02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:10.141]  So that's my comment on that.
[02:08:10.401 --> 02:08:13.401]  I try to answer your question as best I can.
[02:08:14.041 --> 02:08:18.142]  Let's talk to Leslie, calling us from Virginia.
[02:08:18.202 --> 02:08:19.182]  Leslie, you're on the air.
[02:08:19.702 --> 02:08:22.783]  Yes, I just want to make three points here for an update for your listeners.
[02:08:23.383 --> 02:08:26.804]  This morning on WMAL, which is an affiliate of ABC,
[02:08:27.699 --> 02:08:32.383]  We have a well-known program called the Grandy and Andy Show.
[02:08:32.904 --> 02:08:36.667]  And Grandy is the former congressman for four terms, Fred Grandy.
[02:08:37.288 --> 02:08:42.753]  And he made the announcement about the Hastert and Frist bill.
[02:08:42.833 --> 02:08:49.299]  They're going to take out the felony for the illegal immigrants and put in a misdemeanor.
[02:08:49.319 --> 02:08:50.901]  They're retracting it all.
[02:08:51.517 --> 02:08:54.980]  Yeah, all they're doing is rewriting it to be blanket amnesty.
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:55.780]  You got it.
[02:08:56.301 --> 02:09:18.557]  And so what happened, and your listeners need to know this, 100%, and I walked out and I came back and they said it was 100%, this is an hour and a half later, other callers were outraged, they were in shock, how could they do something like this, blah blah blah, they're going to the other side, they're going to give campaign contributions, this is terrible.
[02:09:19.244 --> 02:09:23.447]  And then the next talk show host comes on, and his name is Chris.
[02:09:24.188 --> 02:09:30.972]  And he tells the people that they need to have courage, because he's got the solution to solve this issue.
[02:09:31.573 --> 02:09:44.782]  And the issue, he says, is going to take a lot of courage, and we can't be selfish to resolve this, and this is a national security issue as well, and that is to have a national ID.
[02:09:47.009 --> 02:10:07.988]  I've heard this too, all over TV, all over radio, all over print, they say, whenever Chairman Keene two weeks ago, a week and a half ago, came to Austin, Texas, to be accurate, Georgetown, north of Austin, to Southwestern University to give a speech, it was all biometrics, we're going to get hit by A-bombs, we've got to have national ID cards, you've got to accept it, and I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[02:10:08.772 --> 02:10:14.155]  Well, they already passed the National ID Card last year, but see now, most Americans don't know about that.
[02:10:14.175 --> 02:10:26.042]  Now they've still got to sell it to you, while not even telling you it's being implemented at the state level through your driver's license, and that the illegal aliens are all going to be issued these, and that we're going to have totally open borders with Latin America.
[02:10:26.923 --> 02:10:33.867]  I mean, if you think 25 to 30 million of these people is bad for the economy and sovereignty, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:10:34.147 --> 02:10:35.147]  I mean, ha!
[02:10:35.868 --> 02:10:36.068]  So,
[02:10:37.012 --> 02:10:42.519]  In national polls, depending on which poll you look at, it's in the low 80s or the high 80s of Americans are against this.
[02:10:42.539 --> 02:10:45.923]  And that's when you average blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians together.
[02:10:45.943 --> 02:10:47.485]  Just random phone calls to households.
[02:10:49.407 --> 02:10:55.654]  Now, when you then just do an average poll, and I've done these with Hispanics, it's between 63 and 85 percent.
[02:10:58.114 --> 02:11:00.715]  So you see some lower numbers there, but still it's the vast majority.
[02:11:01.035 --> 02:11:12.760]  But the media keeps framing it as, Hispanic Americans want open borders, and they want the people to be able to work and live, and these people just want to do these jobs as meat packers, and at the farms, and at the stores.
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:23.704]  All they do is drive the wages down in every industry, and they got skilled workers they bring in from Eastern Europe, and India, and China to drive out the middle-class workers.
[02:11:26.295 --> 02:11:27.316]  It's mercantilism.
[02:11:27.376 --> 02:11:28.696]  It's done to bring us down.
[02:11:28.736 --> 02:11:30.117]  It's done to get rid of the middle class.
[02:11:30.157 --> 02:11:31.378]  They openly say it.
[02:11:33.839 --> 02:11:41.583]  And so it's the Democrats, the Republicans, the media, the Spanish media, all teamed up against the American people, telling us to shut up!
[02:11:42.243 --> 02:11:47.505]  They organized these demonstrations for two months through the Spanish media, predominantly owned by old white guys in New York.
[02:11:48.226 --> 02:11:48.626]  Publicly.
[02:11:49.804 --> 02:11:51.265]  And they told them, go out, protest.
[02:11:51.285 --> 02:11:52.385]  This is all organized.
[02:11:52.405 --> 02:11:54.566]  They all wear their shirts like they're told, their white shirts.
[02:11:54.586 --> 02:11:57.407]  They all... Because it backfired when they had Mexican flags.
[02:11:57.427 --> 02:11:58.987]  They've all been issued American flags.
[02:11:59.027 --> 02:12:00.048]  It's all a psy-op.
[02:12:00.368 --> 02:12:01.648]  And that isn't going to work either.
[02:12:02.588 --> 02:12:05.289]  Look, government, your propaganda used to work in the past.
[02:12:05.609 --> 02:12:07.130]  It doesn't work anymore!
[02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:08.410]  Okay?
[02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:10.311]  We're sick of it!
[02:12:10.531 --> 02:12:12.652]  We're past all your left-right bull!
[02:12:15.914 --> 02:12:17.355]  But don't think the Globalists are out.
[02:12:17.535 --> 02:12:19.197]  They're going to do something big, and I think real soon.
[02:12:19.557 --> 02:12:20.217]  But you know what?
[02:12:21.278 --> 02:12:23.280]  It'll be exposed even faster this time.
[02:12:24.701 --> 02:12:28.244]  You see, right when you think we're losing, folks, is when we're winning.
[02:12:29.184 --> 02:12:29.885]  It's called courage.
[02:12:29.945 --> 02:12:30.886]  We're going to beat these people.
[02:12:31.426 --> 02:12:32.687]  Kyle in Washington.
[02:12:32.707 --> 02:12:33.227]  You're on the air.
[02:12:33.247 --> 02:12:33.828]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[02:12:34.867 --> 02:12:37.390]  Alex, thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:12:38.131 --> 02:12:40.314]  I've called you before from California.
[02:12:40.334 --> 02:12:44.719]  I was down in Sonoma County and I've relocated here to Central Washington.
[02:12:44.739 --> 02:12:46.461]  Okay, great!
[02:12:46.561 --> 02:12:54.731]  I just got a lot of compassion for the people around here because the information available over the waves is just complete propaganda.
[02:12:56.238 --> 02:12:59.179]  I have a question concerning Hugo Chavez.
[02:12:59.819 --> 02:13:03.419]  What is your understanding of this man's connections to the establishment?
[02:13:03.919 --> 02:13:04.740]  Is he legitimate?
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:08.880]  Obviously he's an establishment guy to a certain extent.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:09.560]  He's a president.
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:16.402]  But they have tried to remove him in one major coup attempt and several other coup attempts that stalled before they started.
[02:13:16.422 --> 02:13:20.722]  I mean, he was kidnapped, what, three and a half, four years ago.
[02:13:21.442 --> 02:13:22.523]  Almost four years ago.
[02:13:22.543 --> 02:13:24.203]  I mean, this has all happened.
[02:13:25.081 --> 02:13:29.325]  And he is definitely rogue to a certain extent.
[02:13:29.365 --> 02:13:34.910]  They definitely don't like him, but he's got so much oil that they're really having a problem.
[02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:39.634]  So I think overall he's not under the full control of the globalists, and that's why they want him out.
[02:13:40.454 --> 02:13:46.620]  Have you seen Greg Palast's report about the revised numbers on their oil holdings?
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:49.162]  Yeah, it's bigger than Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:49.716 --> 02:13:51.036]  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
[02:13:51.156 --> 02:14:09.620]  I want to thank you for the conversation with Charlie Sheen, and right after I poked in on the web and saw that stuff, that no sooner I see people supposedly lefties like Bill Maher calling him a liar, and nobody actually talking about the facts of the situation, but... Bill Maher called him names?
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.761]  Yeah, he just slid it really quick in.
[02:14:11.801 --> 02:14:15.682]  He just slid it in that he's lying just like Charlie Sheen.
[02:14:15.702 --> 02:14:17.522]  He was referring to somebody else, but he just
[02:14:17.964 --> 02:14:22.147]  Through Charlie Sheenan as a known liar and it was really weird.
[02:14:23.408 --> 02:14:24.469]  What program was this?
[02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:26.151]  Oh, it was his show.
[02:14:26.211 --> 02:14:27.392]  It was the show he has on HBO.
[02:14:27.572 --> 02:14:28.152]  I mean, when?
[02:14:28.312 --> 02:14:28.573]  When?
[02:14:28.653 --> 02:14:29.513]  When?
[02:14:30.374 --> 02:14:33.136]  I must have watched, I would say last week.
[02:14:34.077 --> 02:14:37.160]  I'm not a regular listener or regular watcher.
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:39.882]  Somebody ought to TiVo that or somebody who's got that ought to send it to me.
[02:14:40.222 --> 02:14:45.126]  Yeah, it was really quick and I don't want to take up too much time, but I haven't heard you for a long time.
[02:14:45.226 --> 02:14:47.408]  Do you own a cell phone?
[02:14:48.266 --> 02:14:48.806]  Yes, I do.
[02:14:48.826 --> 02:14:49.606]  You do?
[02:14:49.846 --> 02:14:54.307]  Okay, I was just saying thank you for all you're doing and still tuning in.
[02:14:54.347 --> 02:14:54.747]  Thank you, sir.
[02:14:54.767 --> 02:14:55.368]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:55.828 --> 02:14:58.268]  Yeah, and there's all the evidence of the brain tumors, folks.
[02:14:58.288 --> 02:14:59.749]  Do not let your children have them.
[02:14:59.909 --> 02:15:00.849]  Use a hands-free.
[02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:04.770]  It's so bad for you.
[02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:06.810]  I've been ranting about that.
[02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:09.751]  I know people who just live on them.
[02:15:10.651 --> 02:15:14.452]  I don't use my cell phone very much and I'm always getting a hands-free and losing it.
[02:15:15.604 --> 02:15:19.945]  And I even say I'm an idiot and end up not practicing what I preach here.
[02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:21.606]  So I'm preaching to myself here.
[02:15:22.046 --> 02:15:22.786]  Stop it, Alex!
[02:15:22.906 --> 02:15:23.366]  Stop it!
[02:15:26.387 --> 02:15:27.667]  Let's go ahead and take two more calls.
[02:15:27.707 --> 02:15:29.928]  I've really got to get to the news here before this guest joins us.
[02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:33.589]  Let's talk to Phillip in Georgia.
[02:15:33.609 --> 02:15:34.229]  You're on the air.
[02:15:34.689 --> 02:15:35.109]  Hi, Alex.
[02:15:35.590 --> 02:15:37.090]  I want to thank you for all you do.
[02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:42.091]  I want to talk about your book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:15:42.812 --> 02:15:43.672]  You're talking about
[02:15:44.887 --> 02:15:48.008]  Oh, excuse me, Alex and listeners, I'm kind of nervous.
[02:15:49.028 --> 02:15:59.970]  Talking about drills at schools that are conditioning students, that it's completely normal to have men dressed up like executioners, screaming at them and taking over their schools.
[02:16:00.210 --> 02:16:00.490]  Yes.
[02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:13.173]  Well, this happened two weeks ago, several times, in our hometown of Dade County, Georgia, and had area SWAT teams, local law enforcement,
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:19.881]  And on one occasion, 11 students weren't arrested or anything, but they had their DNA samples taken from them.
[02:16:20.461 --> 02:16:25.342]  And one Dade County student said, it felt like we were prisoners because we couldn't leave.
[02:16:25.382 --> 02:16:29.343]  And when we did leave, there were people every corner watching what we were doing.
[02:16:29.743 --> 02:16:36.985]  And what brought all this on was a teacher reportedly found some graffiti on the bathroom wall that suggested the school would be blown up.
[02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:46.435]  Well, we've caught a lot of police departments and others actually planting things like that as a pretext, quote, so people understand the enormity of things.
[02:16:46.835 --> 02:16:48.116]  We've got to stage something.
[02:16:48.476 --> 02:16:52.218]  But I'm talking about schools just where they have a drill without even a pretext.
[02:16:52.739 --> 02:17:03.586]  We have video of it in Road to Tyranny, aiming guns at 8 and 9 and 10-year-old children as they cry, screaming at them in a drill, and it's nothing but mind control, brainwashing, trauma-based mind control.
[02:17:04.668 --> 02:17:05.669]  Yes, sir, I agree.
[02:17:05.949 --> 02:17:15.418]  Well, in this case, the sheriff, he slipped up and actually said in an interview that it was, he didn't come out and say it was bogus, but he kept using the word scenario.
[02:17:15.498 --> 02:17:23.386]  If we're going to go with this bomb threat scenario, or drugs in the school scenario, we have to do it the right way.
[02:17:23.426 --> 02:17:26.229]  No, no, no, sir, I've seen this a hundred times plus.
[02:17:27.992 --> 02:17:32.575]  Look, they've had fake nuclear spills, sir, and shut down I-35 and called out the Army.
[02:17:33.036 --> 02:17:33.756]  Oh, I see.
[02:17:33.977 --> 02:17:35.958]  And then at midnight they announced, oh, it was a drill.
[02:17:36.298 --> 02:17:36.699]  I see.
[02:17:36.759 --> 02:17:37.999]  It's totally criminal.
[02:17:38.019 --> 02:17:39.060]  They're crooks, sir.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:39.561]  They're crooks.
[02:17:40.401 --> 02:17:41.282]  I appreciate the info.
[02:17:41.442 --> 02:17:42.062]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:42.503 --> 02:17:42.923]  Stay with us.
[02:17:42.943 --> 02:17:43.844]  Look, they're brainwashing us.
[02:17:46.369 --> 02:17:47.189]  Come on, Bill.
[02:17:47.409 --> 02:17:52.590]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:54.411]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:17:54.511 --> 02:17:56.491]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:17:56.771 --> 02:18:02.292]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:18:02.572 --> 02:18:08.834]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:18:09.154 --> 02:18:11.374]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:18:11.674 --> 02:18:14.535]  And get this, they guaranteed my success in writing.
[02:18:15.035 --> 02:18:18.478]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[02:18:18.738 --> 02:18:19.118]  Whoa!
[02:18:19.539 --> 02:18:20.739]  What was that website again?
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:24.302]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:18:24.602 --> 02:18:25.723]  Now write this down, John.
[02:18:25.863 --> 02:18:30.146]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:18:30.307 --> 02:18:30.887]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:18:31.167 --> 02:18:32.348]  I'm going there right now.
[02:18:32.768 --> 02:18:33.409]  Check, please!
[02:18:35.193 --> 02:18:36.635]  Uh, you got this one right, Bill.
[02:18:37.135 --> 02:18:37.715]  Sure, John.
[02:18:37.956 --> 02:18:42.319]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:18:42.619 --> 02:18:44.341]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:18:44.461 --> 02:18:44.821]  Deal.

[02:21:57.293 --> 02:21:58.774]  Let me just run through a bunch of news here.
[02:21:58.794 --> 02:21:59.835]  We've got a guest coming up.
[02:22:00.295 --> 02:22:04.458]  We'll try to jam some more calls in before the transmission ends in 35 and a half minutes.
[02:22:05.019 --> 02:22:08.561]  Lawmaker upset by silence on another Dubai deal.
[02:22:08.641 --> 02:22:08.821]  U.S.
[02:22:08.841 --> 02:22:17.448]  lawmaker on Tuesday fumed the Bush administration refused to divulge anything about a security review it conducted of a Dubai-owned company that is planning to take over several plants in the U.S.
[02:22:17.488 --> 02:22:19.769]  that make equipment for defense contractors.
[02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:22.331]  And that's a 1.24 billion dollar deal.
[02:22:23.352 --> 02:22:24.393]  It's just constant.
[02:22:24.873 --> 02:22:25.493]  Here's another one.
[02:22:25.533 --> 02:22:26.054]  Computers
[02:22:27.356 --> 02:22:55.676]  uh... hijack uh... washington uh... quarter design vote and i don't have time to get off and all this but a bunch of articles were openly there are government-controlled hack groups taking over systems jamming phone lines to stop electioneering it all goes back to the white house stealing elections people are testifying that congressman try to hire him to fix votes it's all coming out mainstream we can do a whole broadcast just on government-controlled election fraud it's totally documented now
[02:22:56.374 --> 02:22:58.034]  Border security system left open.
[02:22:58.074 --> 02:22:59.095]  This is out of Wired Magazine.
[02:22:59.115 --> 02:23:13.238]  A computer failure that hobbled border screening systems at airports across the country last August occurred after Homeland Security officials deliberately held back a security patch that would have protected the sensitive computers from a virus, then sweeping the internet according to documents obtained by Wired News.
[02:23:13.278 --> 02:23:15.619]  And the systems, of course, went down for months.
[02:23:16.039 --> 02:23:16.699]  They didn't care.
[02:23:16.719 --> 02:23:19.800]  No, but they make sure the systems work on the American people.
[02:23:21.607 --> 02:23:24.268]  Continuing, White House shelled Iraq trailer reports.
[02:23:24.288 --> 02:23:27.050]  Remember they found those trailers and claimed they were for anthrax?
[02:23:27.330 --> 02:23:28.491]  The serial numbers were on them.
[02:23:28.531 --> 02:23:28.931]  They knew.
[02:23:28.951 --> 02:23:30.272]  The British had sold it to them.
[02:23:30.632 --> 02:23:34.814]  It was in Jane's Weapons Quarterly Encyclopedia of Weapons and the troops all knew what they were.
[02:23:35.294 --> 02:23:36.034]  We own them.
[02:23:36.075 --> 02:23:37.815]  We buy them from the British here with the same system.
[02:23:38.156 --> 02:23:42.438]  It's for pumping up surveillance balloons that you tether during war.
[02:23:43.675 --> 02:23:44.376]  For surveillance.
[02:23:44.996 --> 02:23:49.779]  The Bush administration claimed trailers captured soon after the fall of Baghdad proved Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:23:50.079 --> 02:23:51.720]  Neocon still claimed on the radio.
[02:23:52.521 --> 02:23:53.321]  Even though U.S.
[02:23:53.341 --> 02:23:56.663]  intelligence officials have strong evidence that that was not the case.
[02:23:57.084 --> 02:24:03.108]  The Washington Post has reported, and it says the two small trailers, it was really four, were seized in May of 2003.
[02:24:03.168 --> 02:24:09.772]  President Bush proclaimed a fresh victory for his administration in Iraq, saying, we have found the weapons of mass destruction, is the quote.
[02:24:11.474 --> 02:24:12.355]  Got to move on that.
[02:24:12.415 --> 02:24:14.857]  That's what, three-year-old news for you listeners?
[02:24:14.937 --> 02:24:15.698]  Almost three-year-old.
[02:24:16.298 --> 02:24:20.041]  We told you in May, so almost three years ago of that year that it was all staged.
[02:24:21.122 --> 02:24:25.346]  EFF AT&T forwards all internet traffic into NSA.
[02:24:25.786 --> 02:24:28.708]  And this is, of course, broke last week in the AP, but I've been out of town.
[02:24:29.189 --> 02:24:35.854]  And it just admits that there's rooms in AT&T in San Francisco, but it's every phone company run by the NSA and everything goes through it.
[02:24:36.095 --> 02:24:37.496]  It isn't forwarded, it goes through it.
[02:24:38.378 --> 02:24:44.142]  Army Hired Criminals and Security Guards report says, I mentioned this Friday and never spent time on it.
[02:24:44.762 --> 02:24:46.483]  And I should do a whole hour tomorrow.
[02:24:46.503 --> 02:24:48.684]  I'm going to get some guests on about this.
[02:24:50.025 --> 02:25:00.531]  We already knew this five years ago, it first broke in the Washington Times, that they don't just hire felons, but illegal alien aggravated felons, violent felons.
[02:25:01.511 --> 02:25:03.452]  People don't understand how serious that is.
[02:25:03.492 --> 02:25:05.914]  Hitler did it, Stalin did it, Fidel does it.
[02:25:06.254 --> 02:25:06.694]  The U.S.
[02:25:06.814 --> 02:25:17.500]  Army private contractors employed convicted criminals as security guards across the country despite repeated warnings in the past three years of the risky situations that could present according to a new federal report.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.321]  Now, remember CPS workers?
[02:25:19.981 --> 02:25:26.045]  They looked at a bunch of states and in almost every state the head CPS worker will be a convicted child molester.
[02:25:27.316 --> 02:25:28.837]  I'm not kidding, you didn't hear about that?
[02:25:28.957 --> 02:25:31.098]  You see, the globalists are crooks.
[02:25:31.699 --> 02:25:34.621]  They put crooks in, because crooks will do it, because they're crooks.
[02:25:35.881 --> 02:25:49.970]  Fort Eustace and Fort Story were found to have some training documentation deficiencies, but have not employed criminals as guards, according to the Army, the private company that manages security guards at two bases.
[02:25:50.743 --> 02:25:52.645]  So they're saying it isn't true.
[02:25:53.085 --> 02:26:07.636]  The report by Government Accountability Office, Congress Investigative Arms, said this is the third time in three years that it has warned the Army that lack of proper background checks could jeopardize security at some of the largest and most important installations including Fort Bragg and West Point.
[02:26:08.453 --> 02:26:17.499]  And then it goes into a report that convicted criminals running the security gates, convicted criminals, just go read the whole article.
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:19.081]  But the Army just denies it.
[02:26:19.441 --> 02:26:28.087]  Just like they say, we found WMDs, and they say we never said we found WMDs, or they say we know they have WMDs, and then they say we never said they had WMDs.
[02:26:28.127 --> 02:26:30.949]  They just lie, knowing the average person won't check into it.
[02:26:33.211 --> 02:26:42.134]  The GAO auditors visited 14 Army facilities including, and it goes through the forts, and it says they found that there were criminals all over the place.
[02:26:43.514 --> 02:26:48.795]  And some of the forts though did receive clean bills of health from the Army themselves.
[02:26:50.776 --> 02:26:54.317]  Not the office that was reviewing that.
[02:26:55.896 --> 02:26:58.477]  Now, here are some of the other types of reports I have.
[02:26:58.497 --> 02:27:00.657]  And again, I can't do justice to this in 30 seconds.
[02:27:00.737 --> 02:27:03.878]  I'll have to see if we have time after our guest leaves us to cover this.
[02:27:04.378 --> 02:27:07.778]  Federal lawyers try to seize gold caps from drug suspects' teeth.
[02:27:08.459 --> 02:27:11.299]  This is Associated Press, and they write the article like it's a great thing.
[02:27:12.779 --> 02:27:13.319]  It's a great thing.
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:16.100]  We're going to take people's dental work away from them.
[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:20.901]  I mean, this is the type of cruel and unusual bizarreness going on.
[02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:26.390]  And then we have drug companies creating fake diseases to then treat the population.
[02:27:27.131 --> 02:27:27.751]  Caught red-handed.
[02:27:28.552 --> 02:27:29.773]  But our guest is coming up.
[02:27:29.793 --> 02:27:30.433]  You don't want to miss this.
[02:27:30.453 --> 02:27:30.834]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.938 --> 02:27:36.819]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.319 --> 02:27:38.881]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.901 --> 02:27:42.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.058 --> 02:27:52.942]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.082 --> 02:28:06.010]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.

[02:30:31.364 --> 02:30:33.605]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:33.625 --> 02:30:34.825]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.403 --> 02:30:58.464]  You know, I know a lot of Hollywood people.
[02:31:00.785 --> 02:31:05.448]  And I'm always amazed that the stereotypes you hear about them are not true.
[02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:10.551]  Here's a case point example.
[02:31:10.571 --> 02:31:20.776]  I mean, I know Keanu Reeves pretty good, and the press always talks about how he's stupid, he's shallow, he's not a nice guy, and then I know other people that know him and they tell the same story I tell.
[02:31:21.742 --> 02:31:22.582]  He's intelligent.
[02:31:22.622 --> 02:31:23.323]  He's informed.
[02:31:23.363 --> 02:31:24.223]  He's compassionate.
[02:31:24.243 --> 02:31:26.504]  He's nice to his assistants.
[02:31:27.725 --> 02:31:30.005]  He is very politically aware.
[02:31:31.406 --> 02:31:35.648]  And then by the time you read articles about him, you know, he's just a horrible idiot.
[02:31:36.368 --> 02:31:37.949]  Well, that's because he doesn't like the press.
[02:31:37.989 --> 02:31:39.149]  He doesn't trust the press.
[02:31:39.609 --> 02:31:40.550]  He's a private person.
[02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:48.313]  And the reason I bring Keanu Reeves up here, and that's just one of, you know, dozens and dozens and dozens of people I know, is because the stereotype you hear about him isn't true.
[02:31:49.338 --> 02:31:51.920]  And the stereotypes you hear about Charlie Sheen aren't true.
[02:31:52.941 --> 02:31:58.044]  And in almost every case what you hear in the press about famous people is not true.
[02:31:59.125 --> 02:32:13.955]  And I bring that up because we have seen hundreds of hit pieces written against Charlie Sheen when he went public now what three weeks ago today saying he questions the official 9-11 story.
[02:32:14.756 --> 02:32:18.799]  Joining many prominent former and current members of government
[02:32:20.052 --> 02:32:29.318]  Economists, physicists, engineers, underwriters of the towers, the insurance company itself has been questioning what happened.
[02:32:30.079 --> 02:32:38.665]  So all this is going on, and then Charlie Sheen, a week into the attack on him, said, challenge me on the facts, okay?
[02:32:39.385 --> 02:32:44.889]  Don't talk about one little distorted piece of my history and my personality.
[02:32:47.174 --> 02:32:56.778]  And having a chance to get to know Mr. Sheen a little bit better in interviews and on the phone and other things, I've just learned how much even more informed he is on a wide spectrum of things.
[02:32:57.618 --> 02:32:59.539]  But the press will not show you the man.
[02:33:00.059 --> 02:33:01.179]  They will not show you the woman.
[02:33:01.199 --> 02:33:02.920]  They will not show you who these people really are.
[02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:11.663]  They want to minimize them because they know they have power because tens of millions of people like their performances and like the roles they play and like the things they do.
[02:33:13.946 --> 02:33:18.892]  And I've been contacted by TV reporters at some of the biggest TV stations in the country.
[02:33:19.393 --> 02:33:20.694]  I talked to CNN reporters.
[02:33:21.235 --> 02:33:22.457]  I talked to CNN producers.
[02:33:22.497 --> 02:33:23.818]  They all know about 9-11.
[02:33:24.619 --> 02:33:26.682]  But they were told to, quote, kill the story.
[02:33:26.722 --> 02:33:28.884]  They wouldn't let Ed Asner come on and talk about 9-11.
[02:33:30.518 --> 02:33:31.439]  That was shut down.
[02:33:31.559 --> 02:33:33.201]  Fox News had me set up for an interview.
[02:33:33.221 --> 02:33:37.705]  Their producers said, oh, that she knew all about what was happening and that a lot of them did and wanted the truth to come out.
[02:33:38.086 --> 02:33:40.548]  And then, boom, I said, this won't get cancelled, will it?
[02:33:40.568 --> 02:33:42.410]  And she said, oh no, no way.
[02:33:42.750 --> 02:33:42.410]  99%.
[02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:43.911]  I knew it would be cancelled.
[02:33:44.372 --> 02:33:45.633]  And then it was cancelled the next day.
[02:33:45.673 --> 02:33:46.634]  They wouldn't let me on Fox.
[02:33:46.934 --> 02:33:48.516]  Because they cannot have this debate.
[02:33:48.876 --> 02:33:50.698]  They cannot challenge us on the facts.
[02:33:50.959 --> 02:33:51.659]  Face the facts.
[02:33:51.679 --> 02:33:53.741]  They cannot face the facts of the truth of 9-11.
[02:33:54.702 --> 02:33:55.382]  And we're doing that.
[02:33:55.842 --> 02:33:58.363]  And Charlie Sheen has sent this all to another level.
[02:33:58.803 --> 02:34:01.104]  Because of his courage, he knew what would happen to him.
[02:34:01.184 --> 02:34:02.465]  He knew what he would go through.
[02:34:02.705 --> 02:34:04.365]  He did it because he loves his family.
[02:34:04.405 --> 02:34:05.606]  He can only be commended.
[02:34:05.866 --> 02:34:08.207]  Look at the fruits of his activity.
[02:34:08.467 --> 02:34:12.408]  Look at the goodness that has come of what he selflessly did.
[02:34:13.869 --> 02:34:14.969]  He is concerned.
[02:34:15.009 --> 02:34:15.789]  He is upset.
[02:34:16.089 --> 02:34:17.770]  He is researching constantly.
[02:34:18.958 --> 02:34:24.421]  He's behaving like a normal person does when they realize what's happened.
[02:34:25.302 --> 02:34:31.125]  And then he got attacked by the London Guardian, which has the biggest British newspaper there is, next to the Times of London.
[02:34:31.185 --> 02:34:33.466]  It shows that circulation is even bigger.
[02:34:34.107 --> 02:34:40.010]  Its columns are syndicated in hundreds and hundreds of Commonwealth papers, from Canada to Australia to New Zealand.
[02:34:42.643 --> 02:34:45.584]  He sent them an email and said, please post my email.
[02:34:45.624 --> 02:34:50.026]  It's a letter to the editor, which normally they would do with a star especially.
[02:34:50.046 --> 02:34:58.909]  And really, it's customary that if someone's written a hit piece on you, that the paper will run your response.
[02:34:59.309 --> 02:34:59.989]  Wouldn't do that.
[02:35:00.409 --> 02:35:02.350]  She wouldn't even respond to his email.
[02:35:02.370 --> 02:35:05.291]  She said, well, I got his email and I'm just not going to respond to it.
[02:35:05.331 --> 02:35:06.111]  I can't tell you why.
[02:35:06.811 --> 02:35:07.732]  Because it's all facts.
[02:35:07.792 --> 02:35:08.792]  It's all documentation.
[02:35:08.812 --> 02:35:11.333]  And if the truth comes out, this criminal network's coming down.
[02:35:12.562 --> 02:35:30.310]  But here's just one reporter we're about to talk to of, I didn't count them up, it's over 20 producers, reporters, big-time people, who were told, no you can't go with this, no you can't cover this, no you can write a hit piece on Sheen, but you can't talk about his challenge.
[02:35:31.131 --> 02:35:40.335]  Well, Saturday we got his email, we vetted him, we checked him out, he's written for several major newspapers, but he writes for the Winnipeg
[02:35:41.336 --> 02:35:44.597]  Free Press that has a paper circulation of 175,000.
[02:35:44.657 --> 02:35:46.357]  So it's a moderate paper.
[02:35:47.237 --> 02:35:47.938]  It's large.
[02:35:48.698 --> 02:35:51.658]  And then of course millions of readers on its news website.
[02:35:52.299 --> 02:35:53.819]  And he sends in his weekly column.
[02:35:53.939 --> 02:35:56.259]  It's put in the paper and it's posted.
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:00.880]  And he sent it in Friday and it wasn't posted.
[02:36:01.421 --> 02:36:03.501]  And he called the editor and he's here to tell us what happened.
[02:36:04.041 --> 02:36:05.442]  And he joins us right now.
[02:36:05.502 --> 02:36:07.302]  He's Dallas Hanson.
[02:36:08.479 --> 02:36:09.941]  And we're honored to have you, Dallas.
[02:36:10.722 --> 02:36:13.505]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:36:13.525 --> 02:36:24.359]  Well, you're the only person that has the courage of the more than 20, really, reporters, and some of them big reporters from some of the biggest shows on TV, TV news, who said, yes, we know it's true.
[02:36:25.682 --> 02:36:29.503]  It runs the gamut from, yes, we know 9-11 is an inside job to, yeah, we know there's a cover-up.
[02:36:29.764 --> 02:36:29.944]  A.J.
[02:36:30.044 --> 02:36:31.004]  Hammer even said that.
[02:36:31.964 --> 02:36:33.565]  But they all say, we've been told to shut up.
[02:36:33.785 --> 02:36:34.785]  We know we're getting ratings.
[02:36:34.825 --> 02:36:35.906]  We know people want this.
[02:36:36.226 --> 02:36:37.346]  We know this is newsworthy.
[02:36:37.746 --> 02:36:39.347]  We've been told to shut up.
[02:36:39.387 --> 02:36:40.387]  So tell us what happened to you.
[02:36:40.427 --> 02:36:41.108]  Go through it.
[02:36:41.288 --> 02:36:42.528]  Tell us about yourself and tell us what happened.
[02:36:42.728 --> 02:36:45.589]  Well, just to clarify things, I'm not a reporter.
[02:36:45.769 --> 02:36:47.630]  I'm an opinion editorial columnist.
[02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:48.110]  Sure, sure.
[02:36:48.130 --> 02:36:49.230]  You write articles for them, sure.
[02:36:49.651 --> 02:36:49.831]  Right.
[02:36:50.411 --> 02:36:51.711]  For the editorial team.
[02:36:54.025 --> 02:37:11.058]  Well, what happened was, when the previous editor retired, a new editor came in, he was formerly a columnist, he originally came from the repertorial pool, and so the outgoing editor pretty much published everything I'd written.
[02:37:11.078 --> 02:37:15.261]  He was that close to pension, he wasn't too concerned about what he was writing.
[02:37:15.321 --> 02:37:20.866]  So, one of the first pieces I sent was about these mysterious
[02:37:21.491 --> 02:37:26.232]  I guess Bush suicides or deaths.
[02:37:28.433 --> 02:37:29.933]  I was told it was a conspiracy theory.
[02:37:29.973 --> 02:37:35.795]  Now, I also run a website for rapid trans advocacy here in Winnipeg.
[02:37:35.835 --> 02:37:39.856]  We've got a lot of social problems in our inner city, economic problems.
[02:37:40.805 --> 02:37:44.950]  And I've put both the articles on the website.
[02:37:45.371 --> 02:37:50.878]  It's truwinnipeg.org.
[02:37:51.318 --> 02:37:55.964]  Sorry, if it's not up there now, we'll just put a link to you at infowars.com and we'll give that out before we leave.
[02:37:55.984 --> 02:37:59.769]  And to be clear, during the break, I talked to you and said you've done other, quote, reporting.
[02:38:00.149 --> 02:38:06.339]  Sure, and frankly I consider editorials with news information in them reporting.
[02:38:07.341 --> 02:38:13.671]  I don't follow the classic paradigm and terms and things that they use.
[02:38:15.213 --> 02:38:15.973]  Well, not in this case.
[02:38:39.989 --> 02:38:41.509]  It was kind of a satirical piece.
[02:38:41.569 --> 02:38:44.730]  It's at truewinnipeg.orgbush.html.
[02:38:44.770 --> 02:38:50.692]  You can read that one there, and there's also another one at nov22.html, November 27th.
[02:38:50.712 --> 02:38:52.873]  So basically, you have two pieces that have been refused.
[02:38:53.133 --> 02:38:57.174]  One on the Bush death list, and then now a 9-11 Charlie Sheen case.
[02:38:57.194 --> 02:38:59.975]  Right, well, I thought it was kind of significant, you know, that J.H.
[02:39:00.015 --> 02:39:04.356]  Hatfield had died of a cocaine overdose or whatever, drug overdose, in this hotel.
[02:39:04.376 --> 02:39:08.457]  I thought, you know, the Margie Schwedinger thing was kind of weird.
[02:39:10.734 --> 02:39:21.337]  The Mark Lombardi, just all these names, and these weird deaths, and finally the Hunter S. Thompson thing, hearing that he was supposedly writing a book on how 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:39:22.438 --> 02:39:35.622]  By the way, I confirmed that with major Canadian journalists that write for some of the biggest papers, and on this show, two of them said, yes, he told me he was doing a book on them blowing up the towers, and that Bush did it, and then boom, he's dead.
[02:39:35.902 --> 02:39:37.863]  Yeah, I put that in my article about the
[02:39:38.345 --> 02:39:41.207]  The Globe and Mail reporter, I forget his name.
[02:39:41.247 --> 02:39:54.436]  To tell the truth, after that happened, I just pretty much figured, you know, I'm just going to stick to writing about rapid transit or local issues, and I'm not going to touch Bush for a while.
[02:39:54.476 --> 02:40:01.100]  But then when the Charlie Sheen thing came out, it was on CNN Showbiz Tonight, and it got a lot of coverage.
[02:40:01.821 --> 02:40:06.404]  I thought, well, here's my chance to write something more international, a bit of a
[02:40:07.446 --> 02:40:09.047]  I wrote a piece about Ethiopia.
[02:40:09.407 --> 02:40:13.109]  I want to show my diversity as a writer, I guess you could say.
[02:40:13.129 --> 02:40:26.057]  And I wrote this piece basically because I had seen the movie JFK and I guess I've read a lot of books about the Kennedy assassination.
[02:40:26.097 --> 02:40:26.977]  I've been to Dallas.
[02:40:27.057 --> 02:40:28.298]  I've been to the sixth floor.
[02:40:29.145 --> 02:40:39.168]  And, to me, this critique of the 9-11 Commission Report and a lot of the controversy and the unanswered questions... Yeah, it's kind of like the... The Warren Commission Report.
[02:40:39.188 --> 02:40:42.609]  The 9-11 Commission Report is the new Warren Report.
[02:40:42.669 --> 02:40:44.090]  But it's even more ridiculous.
[02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:50.091]  Yeah, well, I mean, there's obviously a lot more information out there now.
[02:40:50.111 --> 02:40:58.674]  Instead of just one Jim Garrison in his DA's office, we've got people all over the world shredding this thing to bits.
[02:40:59.324 --> 02:41:03.066]  Now what we know is their official story is a conspiracy theory.
[02:41:03.126 --> 02:41:08.869]  So you tried to run this this weekend and you call the editor up and say why isn't it in the paper and what did he say to you?
[02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:10.030]  Well that's not what happened.
[02:41:10.050 --> 02:41:17.134]  Actually he called me maybe a couple hours after I submitted it, probably right after he read it and said no we're not using this.
[02:41:17.174 --> 02:41:18.795]  It's conspiracy theory stuff.
[02:41:19.415 --> 02:41:22.557]  And I said well I'm not saying that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:41:24.631 --> 02:41:29.374]  He's like, yeah, but you're not saying, you know, he's basically saying there's not even a hint of irony in this.
[02:41:29.394 --> 02:41:33.057]  You're not making these people look ridiculous.
[02:41:33.657 --> 02:41:36.559]  I said, well, no, these aren't ridiculous people.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:42.903]  We've got, you know, a former chief economist in the first Bush administration.
[02:41:45.065 --> 02:41:51.589]  You've got an assistant secretary of the Treasury in a Reagan administration.
[02:41:52.225 --> 02:41:54.266]  I've got this BYU professor.
[02:41:54.286 --> 02:41:55.627]  I mean, these are pretty serious people.
[02:41:56.368 --> 02:41:57.449]  My editor just kind of blew it off.
[02:41:57.469 --> 02:41:58.890]  He said, oh, what's one professor?
[02:41:59.750 --> 02:42:04.654]  How many people were in the Reagan cabinet anyway?
[02:42:04.714 --> 02:42:17.262]  I don't think it's a question of him being, you know, Frater X down at the secret temple told him not to write anything about the 9-11 Commission.
[02:42:17.282 --> 02:42:19.404]  No, it's just he has the establishment view.
[02:42:21.555 --> 02:42:36.660]  I think he was just worried about the paper losing credibility, and it's a serious... But doesn't he understand that 90% of people, 92% on average in polls I've seen, think that the Kennedy assassination was an inside job and a cover-up?
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:46.504]  I mean, they've got major polls out on 9-11 where between half and 80-plus percent believe that 9-11 is an inside job, depending on which poll you look at.
[02:42:46.744 --> 02:42:51.066]  Yeah, well, internet polling and stuff, I mean, it's all pretty informal polling.
[02:42:51.226 --> 02:42:52.466]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[02:42:52.506 --> 02:42:55.928]  The Zogby poll is reliable.
[02:42:56.068 --> 02:42:57.268]  There's now another Zogby.
[02:42:57.288 --> 02:42:58.369]  Have you seen the newest Zogby?
[02:42:58.549 --> 02:42:59.529]  I haven't seen the newest Zogby.
[02:42:59.589 --> 02:43:02.350]  I know the one from 2004, which is, you know, pretty much ancient history.
[02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:09.433]  And since we're being real careful about facts here, I didn't pre-interview you, and so I was talking to you for about a minute and a half during the break.
[02:43:09.933 --> 02:43:12.754]  Well, like I said, I pointed out that this is a paradigm shift
[02:43:37.661 --> 02:43:47.545]  I'm thinking in the American popular thinking that Charlie Sheen has entered the fray and he's saying 9-11 was a controlled demolition.
[02:43:47.565 --> 02:43:51.427]  I think the tide is kind of turning.
[02:43:51.447 --> 02:43:57.889]  I think that the American public is coming more to the forefront.
[02:43:59.110 --> 02:44:02.431]  Just look at the Warren Report, which was once held as gospel.
[02:44:02.451 --> 02:44:04.412]  It was a sacred text that came out.
[02:44:04.492 --> 02:44:05.112]  Unimpeachable.
[02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:10.272]  You gave it to Jim Garrison and he just shot it full of holes.
[02:44:10.292 --> 02:44:14.183]  Mark Lane and so many people have done that since then.
[02:44:14.730 --> 02:44:24.316]  And I think people like yourself, Michael Rupert or Charlie Sheen, they're really starting to pierce some serious holes in the official explanation.
[02:44:24.496 --> 02:44:40.366]  Well let me just say this, and I want to get your view on this if you agree with this, Dallas Hanson, writer for the Winnipeg Free Press, joins us right now, been a writer with them since October 2004, with his weekly editorial column, and they've only refused two, one on Bush
[02:44:41.627 --> 02:44:56.304]  If I understand you correctly, in the Bush death list, and then of course this second one you tried to run this last weekend concerning, well I've got the article right here, September 11th is my generation's November 22nd.
[02:44:56.364 --> 02:45:02.211]  So I want to spend a few minutes that we've got left and go through some of the things you talk about in the article, but my point is this.
[02:45:02.831 --> 02:45:28.753]  The government, like Moses on Mount Sinai, hands down the official proclamation day one, or sometimes hours after a big event happens, and then forever, anyone who doubts their official story, even if their official story is proven to be a total lie and a fable, you are still called a conspiracy theorist for simply trying to do any real reporting or editorializing or analysis of what really happened.
[02:45:28.893 --> 02:45:31.555]  Any investigation itself is heresy.
[02:45:32.444 --> 02:45:32.644]  Right.
[02:45:32.724 --> 02:45:38.628]  My opinion wasn't that 9-11 couldn't be an inside job, or even that we need a new investigation.
[02:45:38.689 --> 02:45:47.635]  My opinion was that the 9-11 Commission report is turning out to be something like the Warren report, in that it's becoming kind of a cultural
[02:45:48.365 --> 02:45:49.026]  Phenomenon.
[02:45:49.266 --> 02:45:50.527]  So you were just... Do not believe it.
[02:45:50.547 --> 02:45:51.788]  Yeah, I mean, I've got the article right here.
[02:45:51.848 --> 02:46:04.057]  You were just reporting on why people question the Warren Report and how societally, how the 9-11 Commission hasn't been discredited in 20 years, like the Warren Report, it's been discredited in a year.
[02:46:04.598 --> 02:46:05.919]  And, I mean, is that accurate to say?
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:07.640]  Pretty much.
[02:46:08.161 --> 02:46:12.744]  And I'm just pointing out, it wasn't just kooks who are critiquing the report.
[02:46:12.764 --> 02:46:17.208]  You've got, you know, chief economists and, you know,
[02:46:18.163 --> 02:46:21.837]  Cabinet secretaries, physics professors, you know, we've got some...
[02:46:22.777 --> 02:46:28.359]  And like you pointed out, you know, demolition experts, the insurance company, there's all sorts of people.
[02:46:28.379 --> 02:46:31.420]  I mean, the amount of information on this is astounding.
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:33.501]  I mean, I could make it a full-time job.
[02:46:33.541 --> 02:46:35.362]  Well, I mean, sir, it's... I'll leave that up to others.
[02:46:35.822 --> 02:46:37.302]  Sir, I mean, it's exponential.
[02:46:37.723 --> 02:46:48.567]  This weekend, I had people in shopping malls coming up to me and the folks I was with, and in restaurants saying, you know, thank you for exposing 9-11, thank Charlie Sheen for me, you know, for exposing 9-11.
[02:46:48.587 --> 02:46:49.527]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[02:46:50.293 --> 02:46:50.973]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:50.993 --> 02:46:52.634]  I mean, I was in a city I don't even live in.
[02:46:52.654 --> 02:46:55.576]  I mean, I was in a city where I'm not even on the radio.
[02:46:55.616 --> 02:46:58.797]  I'm on the radio south of there, but, you know, the point is that it's just everywhere.
[02:46:59.898 --> 02:47:01.319]  Yeah, I think so, yes.
[02:47:01.399 --> 02:47:13.265]  And, I mean, just for the record, on the morning of 9-11, I was living in Vancouver, which is three hours behind New York City, and about seven in the morning, I get a call.
[02:47:13.285 --> 02:47:14.025]  It's my brother.
[02:47:14.045 --> 02:47:14.906]  He's, like, crying.
[02:47:15.481 --> 02:47:35.789]  Saying, you know, the trade center's on fire, the Pentagon's on fire, and planes hit the trade center, and I couldn't believe it, and I turned on the TV, and I watched the towers fall alive, and I got a sick feeling in my stomach, because my first thought was like, holy, no, they had this really planned out, they stuffed the building full of charges, too!
[02:47:36.449 --> 02:47:40.911]  I didn't think that, you know, the fires had caused... Sir, sir, I had a degreed structural engineer,
[02:47:42.092 --> 02:47:42.692]  I think?
[02:48:00.718 --> 02:48:05.039]  I haven't really researched September 11th and all these details so deeply, but the interesting thing about Building 7 is I had no idea
[02:48:20.154 --> 02:48:22.675]  That apparently wasn't told.
[02:48:22.736 --> 02:48:27.618]  I mean, as far as I knew that day, I thought I'd heard on the news that they did intentionally demolish Building 7.
[02:48:27.778 --> 02:48:29.099]  A lot of people heard that.
[02:48:29.139 --> 02:48:33.862]  New Yorkers heard it on NPR they were going to, quote, demolish it, and then now they try to cover that up.
[02:48:34.162 --> 02:48:34.702]  Just stay there.
[02:48:34.742 --> 02:48:38.024]  I want to specifically, though, talk about the editors saying no.
[02:48:38.044 --> 02:48:42.386]  I mean, that's the real story here, is that the editors said no, no, no.
[02:48:42.767 --> 02:48:43.327]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.897 --> 02:48:49.739]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.999 --> 02:48:51.579]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:56.602]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.942 --> 02:49:01.385]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.785 --> 02:49:05.987]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.187 --> 02:49:09.029]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.129 --> 02:49:13.771]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.991 --> 02:49:18.395]  Marshall Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.636 --> 02:49:25.843]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.103 --> 02:49:28.545]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:47.921]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:48.061 --> 02:49:52.183]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:52.303 --> 02:49:55.185]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:55.265 --> 02:50:01.988]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:02.148 --> 02:50:05.170]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:05.370 --> 02:50:07.751]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:12.594]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:13.114 --> 02:50:27.368]  Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:50:27.528 --> 02:50:34.215]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-808-9000.

[02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:50.268]  We're almost out of time.
[02:51:50.348 --> 02:51:52.149]  And this has nothing to do with 9-11, but I've got to read it.
[02:51:52.169 --> 02:51:53.590]  Tacoma, Washington, AP.
[02:51:53.770 --> 02:51:55.451]  Talk about taking a bite out of crime.
[02:51:56.463 --> 02:52:06.393]  Government lawyers tried to confiscate the gold tooth caps as grills from the mouths of two men facing drug charges saying the dental work qualified as seizable assets.
[02:52:06.954 --> 02:52:13.060]  The feds had the suspects in a vehicle headed to a dental clinic by the time defense lawyers persuaded the judge to halt the procedure.
[02:52:14.113 --> 02:52:21.678]  And he says, I've been doing this for over 30 years and never heard of anything like this, said Richard Troberman, past president of the Washington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
[02:52:21.998 --> 02:52:27.742]  It sounds like Nazi Germany when they were removing the gold teeth from the bodies, but at least then they waited until they were dead.
[02:52:28.062 --> 02:52:30.244]  I mean, this is the... They're not even convicted.
[02:52:30.264 --> 02:52:31.284]  They're not even to trial.
[02:52:31.304 --> 02:52:32.405]  They're not even charged.
[02:52:33.606 --> 02:52:34.186]  I'm sorry.
[02:52:34.486 --> 02:52:37.408]  Folks, I've got a giant stack I didn't get to just as bad as this.
[02:52:37.448 --> 02:52:40.090]  I mean, we're entering the outer limits, okay?
[02:52:40.891 --> 02:52:42.752]  Going back to our guest, Ryder
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:52.322]  For several years, every week, Op-Ed columnist for the Winnipeg Free Press, we have links to that site and to his site and a bunch of others up on Infowars.com.
[02:52:52.622 --> 02:52:56.123]  Dallas, just in the last few minutes we've got left, and I want to get you back up some time for longer.
[02:52:56.143 --> 02:52:57.763]  I really appreciate your courage coming on.
[02:52:58.203 --> 02:53:10.586]  Specifically, I mean, are you going to get in trouble now for contacting us and talking about how you're getting basically censored by your editor because just reporting on a cultural phenomenon, you weren't even saying this stuff is facts.
[02:53:11.046 --> 02:53:11.666]  He's saying no.
[02:53:12.890 --> 02:53:26.019]  Well, you know, worst case scenario, I won't have a column anymore, but I mean, I don't think anybody at the Free Press listens to the Alex Jones Show, so I should be okay.
[02:53:26.079 --> 02:53:27.981]  Sir, this is going to get posted.
[02:53:28.001 --> 02:53:28.821]  This is going to get out there.
[02:53:28.841 --> 02:53:29.542]  They're going to find out.
[02:53:29.562 --> 02:53:30.983]  So what do you want to go ahead and say to your editor?
[02:53:32.484 --> 02:53:33.344]  Sorry, Mr. Flood.
[02:53:34.545 --> 02:53:35.286]  You should have run it!
[02:53:38.376 --> 02:53:40.256]  Anything else he said to you in this conversation?
[02:53:41.016 --> 02:53:47.478]  Well, we had a good debate going for about half an hour until eventually he just said, you know, got better things to do later.
[02:53:47.498 --> 02:53:54.340]  I was just trying to document the phenomenon.
[02:53:54.480 --> 02:54:03.642]  My opinion is that I was trying to connect the 9-11 report to what happened with the Warren Report and how a counter-mythology is being developed to the
[02:54:04.565 --> 02:54:12.589]  9-11 report just as Oliver Stone's JFK movie provided a kind of counter mythology to the Warren Report eventually.
[02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:16.731]  I mean, JFK was a pretty influential movie for me.
[02:54:16.791 --> 02:54:23.874]  I was a teenager when I saw it and it really changed my perspective of the world as well.
[02:54:23.894 --> 02:54:32.599]  I mean, that's why it really affected me to hear Charlie Sheen come out as courageously as he did because I'm a huge fan of his cinema and
[02:54:34.172 --> 02:54:35.393]  He's probably just great in Wall Street.
[02:54:35.433 --> 02:54:37.974]  I know he's worked with Oliver Stone a couple times before.
[02:54:37.994 --> 02:54:44.977]  Well, you know, that's a key point you just made, and the word is, I call it amazing courage, but the key word is courageousness.
[02:54:45.357 --> 02:54:47.158]  He is an example for everybody.
[02:54:47.258 --> 02:54:55.462]  He has unwittingly written himself into the history books, not for his films, which he's already there for that, 65 plus, but his courage.
[02:54:55.502 --> 02:54:58.803]  People saw that as a model to model themselves after.
[02:54:58.843 --> 02:55:00.244]  He's got a lot to lose, and he did this.
[02:55:00.504 --> 02:55:01.745]  He's got more to lose than I do.
[02:55:01.765 --> 02:55:03.347]  I mean, he's got like a huge TV show.
[02:55:03.527 --> 02:55:08.773]  I mean, I don't know what he makes per episode, but I mean, I get $250 a week for my columns.
[02:55:08.853 --> 02:55:12.116]  So, I mean, he's definitely got a lot more to lose than I do.
[02:55:12.136 --> 02:55:15.439]  That's why I was unhesitant in coming forward to you with this.
[02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:18.843]  And I said, you know, my editor and I, we kind of had a back and forth.
[02:55:18.903 --> 02:55:21.766]  So it's fair to say his courage pushed you to have courage?
[02:55:22.006 --> 02:55:23.488]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:24.612 --> 02:55:25.513]  That's what I get from this.
[02:55:25.553 --> 02:55:32.798]  I mean, out of 20 plus reporters I've talked to, or columnists, or producers, you're the only one that had the nerve to come on here and talk about it.
[02:55:34.138 --> 02:55:36.680]  Well, good on me, I suppose.
[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:39.362]  Well, you're another example of courage for these reporters.
[02:55:39.402 --> 02:55:44.185]  And the more of you stand up and say you're being censored, it'll be a major breakout for everybody.
[02:55:44.205 --> 02:55:51.250]  But again, your column was just reporting on the, or editorializing on the phenomenon
[02:55:52.110 --> 02:55:53.711]  He didn't realize I was ahead of my time.
[02:56:10.390 --> 02:56:12.831]  All right, I appreciate you coming on with us, Dallas Hanson.
[02:56:12.852 --> 02:56:18.755]  We'll check in with you in the future, and anytime they won't publish your columns, you send them to me and you'll get about 2 million readers.
[02:56:18.795 --> 02:56:19.595]  How does that sound?
[02:56:19.615 --> 02:56:20.176]  Sounds great, Alex.
[02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:21.316]  All right, God bless.
[02:56:21.336 --> 02:56:22.597]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.857 --> 02:56:24.238]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
