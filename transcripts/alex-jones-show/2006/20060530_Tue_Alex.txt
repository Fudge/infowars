[00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.460]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.184]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:10.007]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:11.470]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:13.032]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:17.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:22.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:41.037]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:46.300]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.841]  It is already the 30th day of May, 2006.
[00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.743]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:00:54.343 --> 00:01:01.567]  In the second hour, we have an investigative reporter journalist joining us that's written the article, Oklahoma, the Axis of Evil.
[00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:13.165]  And it shows how so many of the 9-11 hijackers are connected in with different government officials, different people involved in the Oklahoma City bombing are connected to the very same people.
[00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:20.809]  It even connects in to last year that bizarre bombing that happened at a football game up in OU.
[00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.910]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.552]  Then in the third hour there are some activists.
[00:01:27.813 --> 00:01:31.455]  There are some activists who all over the country every time
[00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.908]  One of the members of the 9-11 Commission shows up to an event to proselytize and propagandize.
[00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:39.991]  They show up and they confront them.
[00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:44.006]  They get in their face, and this one lady goes by the name Gypsy.
[00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:50.869]  She blows her whistle to get everybody's attention, and then she starts running through the smoking guns of 9-11.
[00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.451]  She'll be joining us coming up in the third hour today, and we'll play some of these clips from the video.
[00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:07.936]  We'll also play a news clip of a teacher who's been suspended and may be fired over having a private conversation at the lunch table with another teacher about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.414]  And that teacher is running around saying that he deserves to be fired.
[00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:14.635]  It's very dangerous.
[00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:22.002]  It doesn't matter if Zogby polls show that 66% of Americans believe the government's covering up.
[00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:23.744]  50% believe the government was involved.
[00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:26.727]  We have CNN polls that are in the high 80s.
[00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:28.328]  Well, one of them was a 90%.
[00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.651]  Another was a 83% when it closed.
[00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:33.193]  So I say high 80s.
[00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.235]  I average those two together.
[00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:46.849]  And the individuals out there that want to say that the world is flat, well we're going to continue to say it's round, and we're going to see who wins this debate.
[00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.593]  You can try to build straw men to tear us down, you can try to attack us, you can make stuff up and claim that we said ridiculous things that we didn't.
[00:02:55.033 --> 00:03:02.917]  The people are going to learn the truth, they have learned the truth in many cases, and we're going to bring the government terrorists to justice.
[00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:05.739]  The New World Order will be defeated.
[00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.459]  You can be assured of that.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.062]  We'll talk about Bush's new Treasury Secretary, Paulson.
[00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:17.165]  Also, another General has gone public saying freedom is under siege.
[00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:24.109]  Retired General says that America is fighting a war for liberty and our freedoms are being taken.
[00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.130]  We'll get to that after the break.
[00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.812]  Also, Keanu Reeves was in Cannes Film Festival.
[00:03:28.763 --> 00:03:38.190]  That wraps up here in the next day or so promoting the new film Scanner Darkly, A Scanner Darkly, that yours truly appears in, that I also consulted on.
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.351]  I'm very proud of that fact.
[00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:47.837]  And Kiana Reeves talked about how America's turning into a police state and how this film mirrors reality as well.
[00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:51.680]  So more and more prominent people speaking out.
[00:03:53.388 --> 00:04:00.832]  Also, Rumsfeld was on Larry King Live last night trying to revise history yet again, claiming he never said he knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.
[00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:10.377]  Ron Paul's got a report out about trying to stop the National Animal Identification System, which did pass the House just, what, three days ago?
[00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:16.520]  Also, the new fake soldier confession video runs as cover for real slaughter
[00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:24.529]  Dilutes impact of genuine war atrocities like phony rape photos distracted from Abu Ghraib.
[00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:39.985]  And then we have other reports here where the Marine Corps Commandant is saying brace for just a huge shocker and that is of course what's admitted from the photographs that the Marines line up whole families and machine gun them.
[00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.960]  And that's not good.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.462]  It's not good when the North Vietnamese did it.
[00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:45.664]  It's not good when Hitler did it.
[00:04:46.124 --> 00:04:48.387]  And it's not good when the beloved Corps does it.
[00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.474]  And I have no doubt that this fake video has been put out by the government.
[00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:57.219]  We've caught them doing this two separate times, and this fits the MO.
[00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:58.841]  We'll get into all of it when we get back.
[00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:05.070]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.912]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:11.936]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:19.001]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:21.283]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.503 --> 00:05:24.345]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.445 --> 00:05:29.109]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:33.732]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:33.953 --> 00:05:41.178]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.840]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:04.171]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:06.473]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:03.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.137 --> 00:08:06.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.063 --> 00:08:42.080]  About two weeks ago a video surfaced with someone reporting to be a member of the Army Rangers talking about how they would go into houses and shoot people, shoot their children if the parents didn't answer questions.
[00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.542]  And then very soon
[00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:51.645]  The evidence began to emerge, even before the Army claimed it was a hoax, that it was a hoax, and it looked like it was a hoax by design.
[00:08:52.986 --> 00:09:05.352]  Now, if we go back to the week of the Abu Ghraib photos being released via CBS television, and that was only a small part of them, the Congress saw photos that were far more grisly,
[00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:15.252]  And then the Army report came out admitting that they did rape women, did rape children, did torture people with acid, did have dogs biting.
[00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:16.373]  All of that submitted.
[00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:17.895]  Individuals have pled guilty.
[00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:24.803]  We have the White House memos from Alberto Gonzalez and John Yoo authorizing these exact type of activities.
[00:09:25.644 --> 00:09:26.185]  On the record,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.243]  But then we got fake videos circulated by neocon-controlled websites of women being raped.
[00:09:33.483 --> 00:09:39.486]  And I remember looking at them and calling Paul Watson and saying, man, that's as fake as a $3 bill.
[00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:40.427]  It was all over the web.
[00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:41.768]  He said, yeah, they look fake to me.
[00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:43.609]  It looked just like porn.
[00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:45.470]  It was guys just dressed up in camo.
[00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.052]  It was simply brunette, obviously Western women.
[00:09:50.492 --> 00:09:52.073]  It was just ridiculously fake.
[00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:56.665]  And then soon enough it came out, oh, it's a fake!
[00:09:56.725 --> 00:10:00.989]  And so the neocons got on talk radio and TV and said, look, these photos were fake!
[00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:02.050]  None of it's real!
[00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:10.096]  And then we had the big British newspapers with the photos that came out at the same time of troops supposedly urinating
[00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:12.293]  On Iraqis.
[00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:18.056]  Turned out those had been released by British paratroopers, and they didn't get in trouble for it.
[00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:20.337]  It was clearly a staged event.
[00:10:20.637 --> 00:10:23.779]  Then the big headlines were, oh, it's all staged.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:39.607]  Well, now, for the last two weeks, it's been bubbling, it's been in the Associated Press, that the Marines are doing their own investigation, that other Marines have blown the whistle, that members of Special Air Services, British commandos have quit, saying what happened is illegal.
[00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:40.628]  That's all on record.
[00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:47.675]  The Commandant of the Marine Corps is saying, Bryce, for a huge scandal that something bad indeed has happened.
[00:10:48.116 --> 00:10:53.102]  And it turns out the very same sectors, the very same cities, in house-to-house fighting,
[00:10:54.073 --> 00:11:12.104]  and nighttime raids and interrogations that this fake quote uh... sergeant mcbeth video came out well guess what in reality that's exactly what is about to emerge killing family members if they don't answer questions mowing down whole families twenty-something at a pop each time
[00:11:13.743 --> 00:11:15.144]  Now, we've known about this for years.
[00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:16.025]  It's been ongoing.
[00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:20.328]  It's been in the mainstream news, but it doesn't get the play that a fake report does.
[00:11:20.368 --> 00:11:24.892]  And they do this so the neocons can get up and announce that it's all fake.
[00:11:25.272 --> 00:11:26.613]  That it's all theater.
[00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:29.095]  Well, here's CNN.
[00:11:29.816 --> 00:11:33.279]  Lawmakers called a brace for Iraq fallout.
[00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:43.398]  Some members of Congress have been told to brace for fallout for potential charges of murder and cover-up stemming from an inquiry into an alleged massacre of Iraqi civilians by U.S.
[00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:44.739]  Marine sources say.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:55.946]  Military investigators strongly suspect that what happened in the western Iraqi city of Hadithwa last November was a rampage by a small number of Marines
[00:11:56.596 --> 00:12:00.137]  Who snapped after one of their own was killed by a roadside bomb?
[00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:02.198]  These sources told CNN.
[00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:16.003]  Well, there have been a whole bunch of cases where a Marine gets shot or an Army soldier gets shot and they go nuts and mow whole crowds down or there's a crowd threatening them and somebody hears a gunshot go off or a backfire and the Marines open fire.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.341]  Pentagon sources told CNN that at least 24 Iraqis were killed in this one incident alone.
[00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:29.343]  Sources told CNN Monday that the investigators is substantially complete and that charges including murder charges could be filed sometime in June.
[00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:36.745]  And sources said investigators have concluded that there was a cover-up but won't say if it is limited to the handful of Marines who did the killings.
[00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:42.547]  By the way, there have been British officers and American officers who are investigating these different massacres.
[00:12:43.314 --> 00:12:49.482]  From Fallujah to Basra, who've been dying in their tents, or dying in their trucks.
[00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:51.164]  They shoot themselves in the head.
[00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:58.734]  The formal findings of investigators of the matter are several weeks late, said General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:12:58.794 --> 00:13:01.598]  Pace cautioned against a rush to judgment.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.801]  And he went on to say there are two ongoing investigations.
[00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:06.801]  One will be the whitewash.
[00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:08.262]  One will be the real one, I would add.
[00:13:08.282 --> 00:13:08.962]  He told CNN.
[00:13:09.442 --> 00:13:10.622]  One has to do with what happened.
[00:13:10.662 --> 00:13:14.723]  The other investigation goes to why didn't we know about it sooner than we knew about it.
[00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:17.824]  So that's going on there.
[00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:20.725]  And things happen like this in war.
[00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:26.167]  But at the same time, we're seeing record levels of journalists dying.
[00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:31.168]  Now more have died in Iraq in the last three years than died in World War II combined.
[00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:32.929]  That's journalist period.
[00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.395]  That's out in the Associated Press today.
[00:13:35.976 --> 00:13:41.960]  More civilians are dying in this war than any other war in the past, per capita, for the numbers of combatants.
[00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:49.986]  Every indicator is that our moral compass has gone directly into the toilet.
[00:13:51.287 --> 00:13:54.550]  And then of course I mentioned the latest fake video.
[00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.052]  Paul Watson did a great report on this.
[00:13:58.323 --> 00:14:23.330]  Fake soldier confession video runs as cover for real slaughter, dilutes impact of genuine war atrocities like phony rape photos distracted from Abu Ghraib, a widely circulated video in which an army ranger confesses to brutal indiscriminate murder of Iraqi civilians and its vehement debunking as a hoax has acted as a smoke screen for the very real admission and evidence of U.S.
[00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.490]  war crimes in Iraq,
[00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:36.397]  Working in this field for five years and scanning news on a day-to-day basis, you quickly develop a baloney detector that can spot hoaxes, psyops, and frauds from a mile away.
[00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:41.840]  As soon as the Macbeth Marine video hit the internet, I smelt a very large rat.
[00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:51.087]  The alternative media community is plagued by deliberate disinformation specialists and gullible individuals who will act as unwitting conduits for bogus information.
[00:14:51.427 --> 00:14:52.848]  And I even fell into this for about a day.
[00:14:53.508 --> 00:14:59.392]  That minefield of deception breeds confusion, distraction, and lowers the credibility of the truth community.
[00:14:59.853 --> 00:15:06.997]  In the video, Macbeth claims that he was part of a unit that regularly killed innocent Iraqis, their wives, and children if they didn't explicitly follow orders.
[00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:10.099]  Now, London Independent reporters have witnessed this.
[00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:12.941]  This has been in the news, so see, that all gets ignored.
[00:15:13.141 --> 00:15:13.782]  But this doesn't.
[00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:16.216]  Proof that the video is a hoax is legion.
[00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:19.158]  Macbeth's uniform is totally inconsistent with that of a U.S.
[00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:24.281]  Army Ranger and his acclaimed medals are not verified by any official record.
[00:15:24.821 --> 00:15:28.484]  Army spokesman John Boyce said there is no record of Macbeth ever serving.
[00:15:29.104 --> 00:15:30.945]  Initial research by the U.S.
[00:15:31.025 --> 00:15:40.811]  Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg shows no soldier with the name of Jesse Macbeth having ever been assigned to the Special Forces or the Army Rangers, which are in fact two separate disciplines.
[00:15:41.752 --> 00:15:43.613]  At its height, the fake video
[00:15:45.163 --> 00:15:49.625]  Confession was the number two click news item across the internet.
[00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:51.906]  It continues.
[00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:54.167]  I wouldn't really say two different disciplines.
[00:15:54.187 --> 00:16:02.030]  The Army Rangers then is the lower, kind of like the junior high of Special Forces, and they take from the Rangers into the Army Special Forces.
[00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:05.337]  The video has eclipsed the real evidence of U.S.
[00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.519]  war crimes in Iraq.
[00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:10.343]  The BBC video above carries bona fide testimony from U.S.
[00:16:10.383 --> 00:16:14.748]  soldiers who served in Iraq and were party to killing civilians.
[00:16:14.768 --> 00:16:19.854]  To emphasize, this video carries accurate, unimpeachable, and legitimate testimony regarding U.S.
[00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:21.336]  war crimes in Iraq.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.063]  And we have a video above where mainstream news is admitting it.
[00:16:25.423 --> 00:16:33.169]  In addition, charges are expected to be brought against Marines after investigation into the killing of 24 unarmed civilians in Iraqi town in November.
[00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:44.538]  And it goes on and we break down some of the other hoaxes the Feds have brought out on purpose to then discredit and blame on alternative media.
[00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:48.722]  We then have government hoaxes that are discredited and then no one gets in trouble for it.
[00:16:49.412 --> 00:17:11.984]  And that's like the ADL, three weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago, releasing a fake report, quote, citing Iranian dissidents living in Toronto and other areas of Canada, that Iran was going to make Christians wear blue badges, Zoroastrians green badges, and Jews yellow badges.
[00:17:12.768 --> 00:17:15.149]  I remember seeing that and thinking, that sounds fake.
[00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:20.030]  I mean, Iran is crazy enough to do something like that, maybe, but yellow badges?
[00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.650]  I go, no.
[00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.932]  This is coming from the ADL, who are congenital liars.
[00:17:26.772 --> 00:17:35.315]  I mean, they've got... I threatened to sue them last year because they had this border dispute, a border vigilante group,
[00:17:41.104 --> 00:18:01.875]  intelligence report they put out on their website and they had a quote in there where Alex Jones said quote, Mexicans have the most evil culture in the world it is the pit of hell or something like that and what I actually said was the Aztec culture was the most evil culture I've ever studied from an anthropological view
[00:18:03.022 --> 00:18:09.126]  And that I think that the Mexican culture is a hard-working, good, family-oriented culture in many respects.
[00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:17.570]  But they've been enslaved so long with the merger of corrupt, colonial Spanish culture and Aztec culture that it's hard for them to climb up out of it.
[00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:19.972]  Well, I threatened the ADL.
[00:18:19.992 --> 00:18:20.932]  I said, you better change that.
[00:18:20.972 --> 00:18:25.675]  They did change it to, Jones says that some of their cultures are evil.
[00:18:25.695 --> 00:18:26.976]  They kind of paraphrased it.
[00:18:27.016 --> 00:18:27.576]  But the point is,
[00:18:28.337 --> 00:18:29.798]  What they do is lie, folks.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:37.445]  Or they'll say, Alex Jones says the space shuttle explosion is suspicious.
[00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:44.092]  And he's issued other anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in the past.
[00:18:45.052 --> 00:18:46.234]  What does that mean?
[00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:50.998]  Or, what they're saying, what anti-Semites are saying.
[00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:59.279]  And then you read into the report after 9-11, that's what it was called, what they're saying, and it's Alex Jones thinks the government's behind it.
[00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:01.020]  They issued that two days after 9-11.
[00:19:02.622 --> 00:19:04.664]  And I didn't say Israel was behind it.
[00:19:04.684 --> 00:19:09.669]  In fact, I've been attacked by the Klan groups for saying that Israel didn't carry it out.
[00:19:10.209 --> 00:19:13.853]  Frankly, I believe, in hindsight, I didn't know this two days after, three days after,
[00:19:15.148 --> 00:19:16.689]  So their statement then was false.
[00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:26.735]  But I think they protest too much because now the evidence does show that Israel was certainly knowledgeable of it and may have been involved logistically in some support role.
[00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:29.977]  That is, a small criminal element of the Israeli government.
[00:19:30.277 --> 00:19:34.660]  But those that say that Israel carried it out alone, I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.081]  Israel can't make NORAD stand down.
[00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:39.682]  Israel can't... But I'm digressing.
[00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:40.363]  The point is
[00:19:41.187 --> 00:19:44.549]  The ADL lied about the Iranians.
[00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:47.131]  There was no such law, no such debate.
[00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:54.195]  It was totally made up, like the false reports back in 1990 of Iraqis throwing babies out of incubators.
[00:19:54.835 --> 00:19:59.418]  Totally made up by a New York public relations firm.
[00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:04.632]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:04.712 --> 00:20:08.914]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:11.935]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:12.115 --> 00:20:14.516]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:14.716 --> 00:20:23.359]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:24.899]  The Berkeley light is different.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.241]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:29.782]  We're good to go!
[00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:49.182]  We're good to go.
[00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.152]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.572 --> 00:21:10.039]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.121]  That's right.
[00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:13.724]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:21.214]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:29.451]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:34.694]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.376 --> 00:21:40.798]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.178 --> 00:21:45.319]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.699 --> 00:21:45.939]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:47.900]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.260]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:48.840]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.104 --> 00:22:08.048]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:13.370]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:14.091 --> 00:22:21.134]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:30.779]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[00:23:58.663 --> 00:24:09.750]  For EcoV... From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.351 --> 00:24:13.353]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:21.499]  Just finishing up with the ADL and others.
[00:24:24.003 --> 00:24:37.755]  They, for days after it was an admitted hoax that Iran was going to make Jews and Christians and others wear special identifying patches on their clothing, they were still on the news saying, no, we know it's true!
[00:24:37.795 --> 00:24:40.838]  We don't have any proof, but we just know it's true!
[00:24:41.658 --> 00:24:47.443]  And the problem is, the same crowd has called General Zinni anti-Semitic, and he exposed them on 60 Minutes.
[00:24:47.483 --> 00:24:50.186]  They've lost lawsuits now over this.
[00:24:51.653 --> 00:25:03.756]  They call anyone and everyone that doesn't support every single Israeli policy an anti-Semite, and it just doesn't hold water anymore.
[00:25:03.896 --> 00:25:09.998]  It's backfired on that crowd that is pushing for a new world order.
[00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:19.940]  And the ADL and others have a big problem because, what is it, 60% now of Jews in Israel are against the Iraq war and don't support their own government?
[00:25:20.891 --> 00:25:22.573]  And are absolutely oppressed.
[00:25:22.593 --> 00:25:26.396]  You know, it's not just the Palestinians that are oppressed by the Israeli state.
[00:25:27.217 --> 00:25:29.559]  Jews don't really have any free speech in that country.
[00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:35.644]  If Jews go out and criticize and protest, they get arrested in many cases.
[00:25:35.764 --> 00:25:39.427]  Or if they talk about Israel's nuclear arsenal, they get arrested.
[00:25:39.467 --> 00:25:42.069]  And the media is controlled over there.
[00:25:42.129 --> 00:25:45.772]  But where did the stories of Israelis involved in 9-11 come from?
[00:25:47.992 --> 00:25:49.273]  Because it's not an urban legend.
[00:25:49.713 --> 00:25:52.616]  MSNBC has a headline, not an urban legend.
[00:25:53.536 --> 00:25:58.620]  And they report that, wow, Arabs really were telling people don't be in the buildings that week.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.741]  And so were Israelis.
[00:25:59.821 --> 00:26:12.770]  And Odigo, the Israeli instant messaging company, it was in Haratz, that's where it came from, out of Israel, four hours before, did tell every one of their employees, get out of the building with their instant messaging service.
[00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:15.472]  Now that is out of Haratz and the Jerusalem Post.
[00:26:15.853 --> 00:26:17.354]  Their main office is in Tel Aviv.
[00:26:18.268 --> 00:26:20.110]  That's why that was in the news.
[00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:26.836]  And it is true that the buildings were only at about half their normal occupancy capacity.
[00:26:27.237 --> 00:26:34.684]  Now, to not get that confused, the buildings themselves were at about half occupancy in the space that had been rented.
[00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:44.000]  But of the people that would normally be there at 8.30, 9 o'clock in the morning, the buildings were about half empty.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.161]  All the big CEOs were out of the building.
[00:26:47.601 --> 00:26:59.667]  Most of them were at Moffett Air Force Base at 7.30 in the morning before it even happened at some weird secret meeting, the details of which have never been published, in Nebraska with Warren Buffett.
[00:27:01.491 --> 00:27:04.212]  So it wasn't just Israeli firms that weren't in there.
[00:27:04.572 --> 00:27:08.013]  The Arabs, the Muslims weren't there as well.
[00:27:08.073 --> 00:27:10.654]  So see, what I do is I look at all of that.
[00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:14.275]  So I get criticized from both sides.
[00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:22.457]  I get criticized by the Likudnik slash Labor Zionist lobby for saying that Israel's hands are dirty in this.
[00:27:23.158 --> 00:27:30.420]  And then I get criticized by the other government-controlled arm that when we have a hailstorm in Austin, Texas, they say it was Jews.
[00:27:31.756 --> 00:27:33.977]  And by the way, everybody's a crypto-Jew.
[00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:35.437]  Everybody's a secret Jew.
[00:27:35.757 --> 00:27:38.458]  It's all a big Jewish conspiracy and they're out to get us.
[00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:42.760]  And then people who play along with that just play into the hands of the New World Order.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:50.683]  So anytime you speak up against corruption, the ADL could say, oh, you're one of those groups that thinks it's all the Jews.
[00:27:50.763 --> 00:27:55.924]  And I didn't mean to get off into this, but I started talking about the ADL, so why not discuss it?
[00:27:56.965 --> 00:27:58.725]  Why not talk about it?
[00:27:58.745 --> 00:28:00.186]  I mean, we've got
[00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:10.692]  The Israeli Prime Minister here in the United States shaking his finger at us, telling us we need to go ahead and attack Iran, and Israel is manipulating and blackmailing this country.
[00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:12.352]  They've been caught a bunch of times doing it.
[00:28:12.652 --> 00:28:22.434]  They've been caught with spies all over the Pentagon, all over the White House, no matter what administration it is, in the last 30-40 years, and it is a major serious problem.
[00:28:23.715 --> 00:28:25.795]  But as for the religious fervor
[00:28:26.514 --> 00:28:33.417]  With which people from the Zionist lobby attack anyone that criticizes Israel, I'm sick and tired of it!
[00:28:34.037 --> 00:28:47.343]  And I'm also sick and tired of the religious fervor that the Jew haters have, thinking Jews all secretly have cloven hooves and tails tucked into their pants, and are out wantonly engaging in some mass conspiracy of evil!
[00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:48.586]  No!
[00:28:48.847 --> 00:28:50.108]  Governments are evil!
[00:28:50.608 --> 00:28:55.112]  Corrupt racial mafias are evil and are out of control!
[00:28:55.692 --> 00:29:00.676]  Is there a corrupt world Jewish mafia engaging in crime activities?
[00:29:01.076 --> 00:29:03.078]  Is it one of the most powerful mafias?
[00:29:03.498 --> 00:29:03.959]  Yes!
[00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:07.361]  Is it the most all-powerful mafia?
[00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:08.002]  No!
[00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:11.084]  Are most Jews involved in the mafia?
[00:29:11.104 --> 00:29:11.144]  No!
[00:29:12.597 --> 00:29:28.901]  So I thought I'd throw down the gauntlet against the ADL today, and at the same time, against people who never get anything done against the New World Order, but just run around making up stuff, and a lot of it is made up, folks, about the Israeli lobby even itself.
[00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:39.624]  Alright, when we get back, Freedom Under Siege, Retired General says, also Keanu Reeves weighs in on the police state.
[00:29:41.138 --> 00:29:42.840]  And we'll also take your calls.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.462]  We've got two big guests coming up today as well.
[00:29:45.903 --> 00:29:46.984]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:47.004 --> 00:29:47.785]  We're on the march.
[00:29:47.805 --> 00:29:48.485]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:50.567]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:08.694]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:30:08.854 --> 00:30:21.728]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.750]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.375]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:30:27.655 --> 00:30:31.440]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.686]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:30:36.947 --> 00:30:38.649]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:30:38.889 --> 00:30:42.873]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:44.994]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[00:30:45.154 --> 00:30:49.658]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[00:30:49.678 --> 00:30:51.500]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.100]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[00:31:01.638 --> 00:31:07.863]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.003 --> 00:31:14.167]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:22.894]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.134 --> 00:31:30.159]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:35.282]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.502 --> 00:31:40.906]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.246 --> 00:31:44.328]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:52.574]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.674 --> 00:31:53.254]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.341 --> 00:32:05.406]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.627 --> 00:32:09.012]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.192 --> 00:32:12.637]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.924 --> 00:32:16.146]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.326 --> 00:32:21.668]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.708 --> 00:32:31.333]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:32.813]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:38.236]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:38.736 --> 00:32:43.179]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:44.619]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:48.662]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.722 --> 00:32:49.542]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:02.242 --> 00:33:05.043]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.563 --> 00:33:08.924]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.944 --> 00:33:25.348]  Coming up in the third hour, we have a great lady joining us who goes around to different 9-11 symposiums, different 9-11 commission meetings, where they spout the official propaganda line of lies.
[00:33:26.408 --> 00:33:30.289]  And she blows a whistle and then starts rattling off before they drag her out.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:37.382]  The different key smoking gun pieces of evidence documenting that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:40.203]  So she'll be joining us in the third hour.
[00:33:40.243 --> 00:33:50.965]  We have a guest coming on in the second hour to talk about 9-11, Oklahoma City, all the connections to our government and some of the criminal elements that are running it.
[00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:57.647]  Let me cover a couple other pieces of news right now, then we'll go to Bob, James, Rodney, Mark, Maria and others.
[00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:02.970]  Freedoms Under Siege, Retired General Says.
[00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.795]  This is out of the Courier Journal out of Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:34:08.615 --> 00:34:17.803]  A ceremony to honor veterans became a call to action yesterday as Retired Air Force General urged the crowd not to let freedoms that he treasures slip away.
[00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:21.086]  And we're working on getting this general on.
[00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:22.748]  Just one more general going public.
[00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:25.110]  There's two wars going on.
[00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.752]  There's a war in Iraq and there's a war right here at home.
[00:34:28.593 --> 00:34:31.394]  And we may have our eye on the wrong place.
[00:34:31.494 --> 00:34:39.996]  Retired Major General Carl D. Black told a crowd at Highland Memory Gardens in Bilt County.
[00:34:42.797 --> 00:34:44.078]  Bullitt County, excuse me.
[00:34:44.678 --> 00:34:48.259]  Today we're trying to remove God from everything, Black said.
[00:34:48.279 --> 00:34:53.880]  We're trying to do away with the Pledge of Allegiance, remove prayer from schools, remove prayer from the Armed Forces.
[00:34:54.441 --> 00:34:55.721]  I say there's something wrong
[00:34:56.713 --> 00:35:02.398]  With where we are today, and we better wake up and start looking and see just exactly what it is.
[00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:11.905]  Black, a Vietnam veteran, was the featured speaker at the annual Memorial Day Weekend Service, sponsored by Chapter 454 of the Vietnam Veterans of America.
[00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:20.011]  The ceremony, which is the 14th year honors, is Veterans of All Wars, and it goes on.
[00:35:20.892 --> 00:35:25.456]  I think it would be interesting to find out exactly what his full quotes were.
[00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:30.403]  I know my sister just had her high school commencement.
[00:35:30.423 --> 00:35:31.463]  She just graduated.
[00:35:31.483 --> 00:35:33.204]  I wasn't there Sunday.
[00:35:33.904 --> 00:35:36.245]  She's 15 years younger than me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:36.845 --> 00:35:38.306]  That's why she's just now graduating.
[00:35:39.086 --> 00:35:44.909]  And the teacher that the students chose to give the keynote speech, I didn't know was a fan.
[00:35:44.969 --> 00:35:45.969]  I just learned that.
[00:35:46.784 --> 00:35:47.225]  I don't know.
[00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:12.338]  If people want to maintain the ideas and ideas that veterans fought for continue to make this country great, Black said, then you and I and younger American generations coming on must get involved.
[00:36:12.378 --> 00:36:18.439]  Today we have come to pay respects to our fallen heroes and fallen comrades, but not that alone, Black said.
[00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:27.781]  Today we have come to receive the torch, to hold it high and to keep the faith, and to pass it from generation to generation, and has been done since the nation was founded.
[00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:34.041]  It goes on, but the General is right.
[00:36:34.181 --> 00:36:35.441]  Our freedoms are disappearing.
[00:36:36.462 --> 00:36:43.185]  He went on to say, they just take for granted all the freedoms that we have and think, aw, they were just given to us.
[00:36:43.285 --> 00:36:46.266]  Indeed, they should be teaching youths the basics, he said.
[00:36:46.607 --> 00:36:48.307]  Teach them to respect the flag.
[00:36:48.327 --> 00:36:49.768]  Teach them to respect themselves.
[00:36:50.248 --> 00:36:51.429]  Teach them history.
[00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:53.750]  And he went on.
[00:36:57.092 --> 00:36:57.532]  Oh boy.
[00:36:57.912 --> 00:36:59.953]  President Bush taps Paulson
[00:37:00.734 --> 00:37:11.897]  For new Treasury Secretary, Treasury Secretary John Snow resigned Tuesday and President Bush nominated Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Henry M. Paulson, Jr.
[00:37:12.377 --> 00:37:13.137]  as his replacement.
[00:37:13.157 --> 00:37:17.118]  Another chapter in the shake-up to revive Bush's troubled presidency.
[00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:19.399]  He has a lifetime of business experience.
[00:37:19.439 --> 00:37:24.741]  He has intimate knowledge of financial markets and the ability to explain economic issues in clear terms.
[00:37:25.101 --> 00:37:29.942]  Bush said of Paulson in the Rose Garden announcement, White House officials believe that Wall Street executive
[00:37:30.522 --> 00:37:35.824]  Paulson's talents could better make the case for the administration's economic growth program.
[00:37:40.465 --> 00:37:44.326]  You know, they can put whatever fancy spin they want on the economy.
[00:37:44.366 --> 00:37:50.067]  They can point at the stock market at 11,700 and something, highest it's ever been.
[00:37:50.848 --> 00:37:59.550]  They can point at whatever indicators they want, but the truth is the stock market has grown because the money supply has been doubled in the last six years.
[00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:07.483]  And so we really have a 6,000 roughly stock market.
[00:38:07.523 --> 00:38:11.245]  That's what it is in 2,000 numbers.
[00:38:11.365 --> 00:38:16.909]  And we've had Nobel Prize winning economists and other top economists on this broadcast to break that down.
[00:38:17.749 --> 00:38:19.870]  The stock market is really at around 6,000.
[00:38:20.571 --> 00:38:23.452]  And that's in the foreign financial publications as well.
[00:38:23.873 --> 00:38:25.534]  You just won't hear that here in the U.S.
[00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:29.872]  Debt is at all-time highs.
[00:38:29.912 --> 00:38:33.115]  We have the highest debt ratio that we've ever had in U.S.
[00:38:33.135 --> 00:38:33.515]  history.
[00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:39.240]  It is greater than at the depth of the Depression in late 1933.
[00:38:39.721 --> 00:38:40.982]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:38:41.442 --> 00:38:42.463]  This is just the facts.
[00:38:44.685 --> 00:38:50.310]  And so, short term, it makes things look rosy to be printing money like it's going out of style.
[00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.954]  Now, Bernanke, the new Fed Chief, says he's going to print money even faster.
[00:38:58.018 --> 00:38:59.939]  No amount of tax cuts are going to fix that.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.801]  We have been fleeced.
[00:39:04.182 --> 00:39:07.524]  But c'est la vie, it's all going to come home to roost very, very soon.
[00:39:08.025 --> 00:39:09.946]  Let's go to your phone calls now.
[00:39:09.966 --> 00:39:11.247]  I'm going to move quickly here.
[00:39:11.747 --> 00:39:13.088]  Bob in Nevada, welcome.
[00:39:13.448 --> 00:39:14.329]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:21.754]  I've changed the subject I was going to originally talk to you about, but because you were talking about atrocities,
[00:39:23.595 --> 00:39:49.777]  I remember reading on Jeff's website, and then later on when I got onto your website about atrocities very early on, Robert Fisk, who Ted Koppel refers to as the finest, most renowned international reporter, very early on reported from Iraq that he observed a Marine sniper shoot an old woman, an old man, and a small boy.
[00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.651]  Just, you know, just shooting them.
[00:39:53.671 --> 00:39:54.372]  That's right.
[00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.433]  The London Independent, very respected.
[00:39:56.453 --> 00:40:01.577]  I mean, they've got less retractions than any publication I've seen, and it's been confirmed.
[00:40:02.417 --> 00:40:02.697]  U.S.
[00:40:02.737 --> 00:40:09.802]  troops would brag and shoot women and children in front of them with sniper rifles, laughing.
[00:40:09.982 --> 00:40:14.906]  This was in The Guardian, I think, but The Independent and The Guardian both were reporting stories like this.
[00:40:15.365 --> 00:40:22.190]  Then there was an earlier one, a soldier from Afghanistan came back and wrote a letter on Jeff Webb.
[00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:28.694]  Yeah, that was Calhoun, and that was in the Buffalo newspaper.
[00:40:29.335 --> 00:40:31.977]  And then the Army came out and didn't retract.
[00:40:32.017 --> 00:40:35.900]  They said, well, it's true what he said, but there are hostiles in these villages.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.664]  And what the sergeant said was that they were killing everyone, including small children.
[00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:44.185]  And that was not retracted.
[00:40:44.245 --> 00:40:44.926]  That is admitted.
[00:40:45.697 --> 00:41:15.360]  There's also two and a half years ago in Switzerland I was staying at a youth hostel and I was talking to a young guy from New Zealand who about 9-11 I said it was a fraud I left the country for a few months because I thought they were going to do another government was going to do another one and I wanted to watch from the outside and I was talking to him and this guy he's about 60 walks in sits down about 10 feet away and was listening and
[00:41:16.027 --> 00:41:25.590]  And he pops in, he started talking, and he said he was a retired colonel from special ops, and he left the country because he got sick of it.
[00:41:26.551 --> 00:41:41.976]  And he said, but he went on, he was a little bit crazy, but he told me that they were presented with, a group of them, with an Islam, or Muslim,
[00:41:43.194 --> 00:41:47.736]  Apparently dressed like a Moslem, at least, who made a presentation to him.
[00:41:47.776 --> 00:42:02.522]  He said he had converted to Christianity, and he had said to them, to the soldiers, that for a Moslem to be redeemed by God, he had to kill a Christian or a Jew before he died.
[00:42:03.382 --> 00:42:10.125]  And I didn't register to the next day that that was complete lunacy, because if that were the case,
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:18.863]  They would be killing Christians, and I'm the record for it, ever since 600 when the Muslim religion got started.
[00:42:19.283 --> 00:42:20.964]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:42:21.644 --> 00:42:35.069]  There are a few small sects who believe it is good, that it's a brownie point, to get them into heaven if they do indeed kill Christians or other unbelievers.
[00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.970]  But they don't really
[00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:38.851]  Let me be clear.
[00:42:38.911 --> 00:42:39.972]  Pagans are heathens.
[00:42:39.992 --> 00:42:44.653]  They don't really consider Christians and Jews as heathens because they believe it's the same God.
[00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:51.015]  But there are some sects that do believe that Christians are heathen and need to die.
[00:42:51.055 --> 00:42:52.376]  But it's a very small group.
[00:42:52.396 --> 00:42:54.556]  They've had big regional polls.
[00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:58.357]  Around 6% of Muslims are rabid and want to kill everybody.
[00:42:59.038 --> 00:43:02.659]  I'd say a bigger percentage of Americans say turn the Middle East into a parking lot.
[00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:05.980]  So, you know, Muslims could use that example to say we're all crazy.
[00:43:06.956 --> 00:43:12.301]  But they do go in and demonize Muslims in front of the troops with similar propaganda.
[00:43:12.842 --> 00:43:16.485]  You can hear it on talk radio, sir, all the time.
[00:43:17.225 --> 00:43:20.208]  I mean, it's like a comic book, it's so ridiculous.
[00:43:20.228 --> 00:43:24.372]  Now, you left the country a few years ago because you thought there was going to be an attack.
[00:43:24.872 --> 00:43:28.395]  Listen, if you were ever going to leave because of that, now would be the time, buddy.
[00:43:29.036 --> 00:43:33.640]  I mean, if we're ever going to see a terror attack, I would say the next six months to a year.
[00:43:34.777 --> 00:43:59.324]  And that's what Ray McGovern, Chief CIA Analyst for Bush and, of course, Ronald Reagan, Bush Senior and Reagan, yesterday said that it's very clear that they've at least got the pieces on the board and that they want to attack Iran from late June into October for the election and for a bunch of other reasons.
[00:43:59.344 --> 00:44:01.265]  And Israel is saying they may go ahead and do it.
[00:44:02.368 --> 00:44:05.829]  And I said, Ray McGovern, I said, do you think our government will stage a terror attack?
[00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:08.869]  And he said, yes, that's a very good possibility.
[00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.790]  There's a very good chance of that happening.
[00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:18.171]  So, if we ever were watchful, if we were ever vigilant, if we were ever concerned, now is the time.
[00:44:18.211 --> 00:44:26.633]  See, I don't just get up here and, oh, Houston will be nuked next week, and then it doesn't happen, and the person that says it doesn't lose any credibility.
[00:44:27.253 --> 00:44:30.854]  Or, I guarantee you, Chicago will be next month.
[00:44:32.023 --> 00:44:36.868]  I guarantee you that is COINTELPRO all the way.
[00:44:37.328 --> 00:44:41.752]  I'm not seeing everybody spouting that as a government agent, but we know where that's coming from.
[00:44:41.792 --> 00:44:46.757]  Anybody who just over and over again makes predictions, over and over again tries to scare people,
[00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:48.950]  That's what the White House does.
[00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:49.771]  They told U.S.
[00:44:49.811 --> 00:44:58.840]  News and World Report two months before the November election in 2004, they said there is going to be a nuclear attack on D.C.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.482]  or New York before the election.
[00:45:00.802 --> 00:45:02.303]  They said it will happen.
[00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:04.045]  The White House said that.
[00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:06.628]  I said, folks, this is not going to happen.
[00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:08.850]  They're just fear-mongering.
[00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:09.991]  They're scaring you.
[00:45:10.351 --> 00:45:11.953]  They're using this to stampede you.
[00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:17.993]  And it's the Feds that continually say, not a question of it but when, we're going to be attacked.
[00:45:18.373 --> 00:45:21.236]  It's going to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[00:45:21.696 --> 00:45:25.039]  To keep that fear going, to keep that terrorism fresh in your mind.
[00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:34.767]  But if there was ever going to be an event, and we may be able to expose it, we may be able to back them off now, but if there was ever going to be an event, the next six months to a year, maybe even sooner.
[00:45:35.507 --> 00:45:37.269]  James in Maryland, James go ahead.
[00:45:40.117 --> 00:45:40.817]  Hello, James.
[00:45:41.058 --> 00:45:41.358]  Hello?
[00:45:41.598 --> 00:45:42.178]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:45:42.318 --> 00:45:53.404]  Yes, I was wondering if you were in possession of or if you knew where to get the actual FEMA documents or the training manuals that they're handing to the pastors in the 13,000 counties?
[00:45:53.804 --> 00:45:59.147]  Yes, we have a copy for free download for you right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:59.847 --> 00:46:02.029]  What would that be under what headline?
[00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:08.292]  Well, we wrote the article when it came out last Tuesday
[00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:20.069]  And we got a bunch of the public documents posted, and then we posted the 30-something page document that was specifically given out to preachers in Ohio.
[00:46:20.989 --> 00:46:26.450]  Then we got calls from the preachers panicking because we took the main preacher's name off, but it had some of the other preacher's names.
[00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:30.431]  So last time I checked, we blacked that out and reposted it.
[00:46:31.691 --> 00:46:38.353]  And so I would just type in, you know, that's why every day you need to read the site, but it's in the archives from last week.
[00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:40.110]  Thanks.
[00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.690]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:41.511]  Thank you.
[00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:42.651]  I appreciate the call.
[00:46:43.571 --> 00:46:45.052]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[00:46:45.172 --> 00:46:46.532]  Well, you see, the caller brought that up.
[00:46:46.552 --> 00:46:47.753]  Where would he get that manual?
[00:46:47.773 --> 00:46:48.933]  People don't know what we're talking about.
[00:46:49.413 --> 00:46:53.394]  Training preachers to tell their flock to go ahead and turn their guns in.
[00:46:53.454 --> 00:46:54.735]  Martial law is good.
[00:46:55.115 --> 00:46:56.695]  Go to relocation centers.
[00:46:57.136 --> 00:46:58.316]  Submit to the government.
[00:46:58.376 --> 00:46:59.416]  Romans 13.
[00:46:59.977 --> 00:47:01.017]  Really scary stuff.
[00:47:01.537 --> 00:47:02.557]  Rodney in Texas.
[00:47:02.637 --> 00:47:03.378]  Rodney, go ahead.
[00:47:04.098 --> 00:47:05.758]  Thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:21.447]  Alex, you remember when this story first broke about the troops being involved in torture and murder and Antonio Taguba report, the International Red Cross report, Abu Ghraib and so on and so forth.
[00:47:22.467 --> 00:47:30.912]  You had all the neocons trying to defend it and most especially Rush Limbaugh saying that they were just blowing off a little steam.
[00:47:32.717 --> 00:47:38.240]  Well, first they denied it and said it was all fake, and magically government organs released fake pictures.
[00:47:38.941 --> 00:47:42.123]  Then, I mean, I still have neocons walk up and say it's all fake.
[00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:43.704]  How dare you make a film?
[00:47:43.964 --> 00:47:44.884]  See how they do that?
[00:47:44.964 --> 00:47:49.227]  First they say it's fake, they release fake videos, fake photos, then that's discredited.
[00:47:49.507 --> 00:47:52.349]  Then the real stuff comes out, and then they say, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:47:53.149 --> 00:48:00.414]  Yeah, and I'm trying to, and I'm wondering if these guys are just blowing off a little steam like Rush Limbaugh says, why the cover-up?
[00:48:01.414 --> 00:48:02.255]  Why the cover-up?
[00:48:03.795 --> 00:48:04.836]  According to Mercer.
[00:48:06.196 --> 00:48:07.037]  Why the cover-up?
[00:48:08.178 --> 00:48:15.822]  Well, Congress saw over a thousand videos and over, excuse me, over a thousand photos and a hundred videos.
[00:48:15.982 --> 00:48:17.823]  Remember they were given one day to look at them?
[00:48:18.183 --> 00:48:18.384]  Yes.
[00:48:18.584 --> 00:48:21.485]  And the Senators and Congressmen walked out and said, we're sick.
[00:48:22.106 --> 00:48:27.509]  And they reported, well, we're not going to let you see it, but it's... I don't even want to say what's on the tape, but... Right.
[00:48:27.789 --> 00:48:30.871]  And then General Togumbo's own report, and people pled guilty to this,
[00:48:31.748 --> 00:48:34.229]  Raping children, raping women, it's all admitted!
[00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:42.673]  But the neocons still deny it and say it's fake, because neocon publications first circulated the fake rape photos.
[00:48:42.713 --> 00:48:43.674]  These guys are slick!
[00:48:43.994 --> 00:48:56.720]  Right, now Alex, as another caveat, now if everybody is so shocked and disgusted behind this, I've heard you many times talk about how John Hugh and
[00:48:58.223 --> 00:49:01.665]  People of this kind have said that this is okay.
[00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:08.369]  You know, this sort of behavior on the part of the Marines and doing this sort of thing, that this is okay.
[00:49:08.409 --> 00:49:13.531]  So, if these soldiers are to be punished, why not John Hugh and some of these other people?
[00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:14.092]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:49:14.132 --> 00:49:21.996]  John Hugh, one of the White House counsels, deputy of Humberto Gonzalez, wrote in a memo, they can torture small children, including sexually, in front of their parents.
[00:49:22.745 --> 00:49:32.329]  And four months ago, in front of the CFR, and I had the professor on that questioned me, in Chicago, and we have a recording of it, we can play it right now, John, you said, yes, I wrote that, and yes, it's okay.
[00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:34.750]  And so, it's on record.
[00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.951]  And it's true that they ordered the troops to do this.
[00:49:38.843 --> 00:49:43.526]  They had CIA and private contractors over the wings of those camps.
[00:49:43.566 --> 00:49:45.767]  They have an internal wing at Gitmo.
[00:49:46.088 --> 00:49:47.909]  They have internal wings at Abu Ghraib.
[00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.470]  So both in Cuba and Iraq they have.
[00:49:50.730 --> 00:50:00.937]  Then all the secret camps that are even worse in Israel, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, in Europe.
[00:50:01.917 --> 00:50:06.080]  They have these things, former Eastern Bloc, where they're killing people!
[00:50:07.026 --> 00:50:18.318]  I mean, it's even worse than what we've been told, and we know the White House, and then Bush comes out and first he says we're not torturing, then he says it's not torture, we call it pressure, then he says, I'm above the law, we're allowed to.
[00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.596]  So, that's all on record.
[00:50:20.616 --> 00:50:22.717]  So, yes, you just hit the nail on the head.
[00:50:23.157 --> 00:50:24.778]  Why aren't they getting in trouble?
[00:50:25.078 --> 00:50:44.203]  It's like the police busting a street-level muscle, or enforcer, soldier, of the Mafia, and then having the documents that the Don ordered it, having surveillance recordings of the Don ordering the hit, and the Don doesn't get in trouble, and the Don sits in judgment of his own soldier.
[00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:48.330]  Anything else, Rodney?
[00:50:48.511 --> 00:50:49.111]  Yes, yes.
[00:50:49.272 --> 00:50:50.974]  One more quick point.
[00:50:51.154 --> 00:50:57.023]  The Pope, it is known that he was a youth, part of Hitler's youth.
[00:50:57.063 --> 00:50:57.504]  Stay there.
[00:50:57.784 --> 00:50:59.467]  We'll talk about Ratzinger on the other side.
[00:51:01.471 --> 00:51:02.972]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.132 --> 00:51:06.234]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:10.256]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.297 --> 00:51:14.539]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.879 --> 00:51:18.662]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.802 --> 00:51:20.643]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.783 --> 00:51:24.125]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:25.226]  The medical bills!
[00:51:26.826 --> 00:51:28.867]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.007 --> 00:51:32.048]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.228 --> 00:51:35.089]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:41.691]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:46.033]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.433 --> 00:51:47.793]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.193 --> 00:51:49.214]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.234 --> 00:51:51.214]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:52:00.908 --> 00:52:08.434]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.715 --> 00:52:19.624]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:19.884 --> 00:52:20.184]  Yes, we are!
[00:52:36.369 --> 00:52:36.870]  That's right!
[00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:44.155]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.455 --> 00:52:48.578]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:48.738 --> 00:52:52.861]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:53.422]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.785 --> 00:53:03.246]  Thank you.
[00:53:18.067 --> 00:53:18.727]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.603 --> 00:53:50.684]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.844 --> 00:53:56.785]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:09.967 --> 00:54:14.168]  Alright, Rodney in Texas, finish up your statement.
[00:54:14.808 --> 00:54:15.528]  Yeah, uh...
[00:54:16.223 --> 00:54:28.047]  You were talking about how ADL and, you know, these groups, Simon Wiesenthal, these groups, they send their attack dogs after youth, you know, on false allegations.
[00:54:28.107 --> 00:54:40.151]  But yet, the Pope, this current Pope, is an admitted, you know, soldier in the German military during Hitler's era and a youth, part of that youth movement.
[00:54:40.872 --> 00:54:42.712]  And I was reading in the Minneapolis-St.
[00:54:42.732 --> 00:54:44.413]  Paul Pioneer Press,
[00:54:45.475 --> 00:54:56.201]  Saturday or Sunday, that he makes no apologies about it, and I don't see the ADL or Simon Wiesenthal going after him, and I'm just curious why.
[00:54:56.261 --> 00:55:07.347]  Well, it's like Schwarzenegger, he admittedly gave Hitler recordings to friends, he would howl Hitler, he said he admired Hitler, told magazines that, told Rolling Stone that, but that's okay!
[00:55:07.607 --> 00:55:11.850]  But I'm against Nazis, and so the ADL likes to snipe at me,
[00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:15.112]  They don't have one single anti-semitic quote from me.
[00:55:15.152 --> 00:55:20.014]  They just say Alex thinks 9-11 is an inside job, so he's anti-semitic, whatever that means.
[00:55:20.094 --> 00:55:23.876]  Or Alex thinks the Federal Reserve is bad, so he's anti-semitic.
[00:55:23.916 --> 00:55:26.978]  Or Alex believes in a new world order, so he's anti-semitic.
[00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:36.059]  And that's why they're getting sued by a bunch of people, they've lost lawsuits, they've got generals mad at them, and so that's why they've lost all credibility.
[00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:44.021]  But yeah, Ratzinger was a member of the Hitler Youth, and he says that he doesn't make an apology because he was forced into it, he claims.
[00:55:44.661 --> 00:55:51.582]  And I guess there in the last months of the war they did force a lot of people into the Hitler Youth, so in a way that holds water.
[00:55:51.622 --> 00:55:56.483]  But what doesn't hold water, Rodney, is that he calls for a new world order every time I turn around.
[00:55:57.043 --> 00:55:58.524]  That's what's bad about Ratzinger.
[00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:21.862]  Well, not just that.
[00:56:22.563 --> 00:56:23.343]  George Jr.'
[00:56:23.323 --> 00:56:29.487]  's first money he got for oil investments was directly from money they were making through the 50s and 60s.
[00:56:29.847 --> 00:56:36.851]  They still control a lot of those assets that were brought into different areas of Latin America and into Texas.
[00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:38.011]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:40.012]  I mean, that's mainstream news, folks.
[00:56:40.493 --> 00:56:42.314]  That was in big papers in the 40s and 50s.
[00:56:43.812 --> 00:56:44.873]  And it's on the record.
[00:56:45.013 --> 00:56:48.354]  Scholarly dissertations have been given on this.
[00:56:48.555 --> 00:56:50.896]  Scholarly books have been published on this.
[00:56:50.956 --> 00:56:51.916]  It's not been refuted.
[00:56:51.956 --> 00:56:58.880]  My film, Martial Law, in three hours, spends about 30 minutes on the bushes in Hitler.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.741]  And it's an incredible section.
[00:57:00.781 --> 00:57:03.822]  It's well worth the price just for that.
[00:57:03.862 --> 00:57:04.743]  We also get into 9-11.
[00:57:04.863 --> 00:57:06.224]  We get into the police state.
[00:57:06.684 --> 00:57:07.844]  We get into Schwarzenegger.
[00:57:07.884 --> 00:57:09.125]  It's such an important film.
[00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:12.627]  That's why all of you have absolutely got to get Martial Law.
[00:57:13.826 --> 00:57:27.734]  We have a lot of big specials up on the Secure Online Shopping Cart at InfoWars.com, where you can get Martial Law and three other DVDs for just, I don't know, what is it, like $20-something dollars off when you get three of the videos, $25 off when you get four of the videos.
[00:57:28.114 --> 00:57:30.856]  We've got deals where it's like $60 off when you get five.
[00:57:30.936 --> 00:57:34.678]  I mean, it just gets... We've got deals where videos are as low as $5.95 a piece.
[00:57:34.698 --> 00:57:35.439]  Whole films.
[00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:39.335]  People get confused, too.
[00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:43.997]  You know, I say when you order The Order of Death, my newest film, you get a free video.
[00:57:44.097 --> 00:57:45.517]  It's on the same DVD, folks.
[00:57:45.997 --> 00:57:52.559]  On the same DVD, there is The Order of Death, my new film about skull and bones, the new video shot inside Bohemian Grove last year.
[00:57:53.059 --> 00:58:00.701]  Then we have the re-edited, remastered, re-released Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, updated, two films on the same DVD.
[00:58:02.296 --> 00:58:03.237]  All the time I get a call.
[00:58:03.277 --> 00:58:04.297]  Hey, I got one DVD!
[00:58:04.337 --> 00:58:04.757]  What is this?
[00:58:05.097 --> 00:58:09.239]  They're both on the same DVD, folks, so be sure and get that great combo deal.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.641]  You get an entire film for free.
[00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:16.583]  When you get The Order of Death, you get the updated, revamped Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:58:16.863 --> 00:58:18.624]  So go to InfoWars.com to order.
[00:58:19.044 --> 00:58:19.885]  Our calls toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.

[00:58:57.719 --> 00:58:58.379]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.039 --> 00:59:00.080]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.960]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.561 --> 00:59:03.401]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:05.042]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.702 --> 00:59:09.424]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.884 --> 00:59:14.006]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.706 --> 00:59:16.947]  Remember Nick Byrd?
[00:59:17.127 --> 00:59:20.168]  He got his head supposedly sawed off in Iraq.
[00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:24.470]  Why did he give one of the hijackers his laptop and passcode?
[00:59:25.487 --> 00:59:31.468]  Why did he and so many others, including Oklahoma City Bombers, train at the same military base, same flight school?
[00:59:32.288 --> 00:59:33.668]  How does it all interconnect?
[00:59:33.828 --> 00:59:36.749]  Very, very important, detailed report coming up.
[00:59:36.809 --> 00:59:41.590]  We have posted on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com with a guest in the next segment.
[00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:42.830]  Right now, R.B.
[00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:44.490]  R.B., you're on the air.
[00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:45.531]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:47.011]  Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
[00:59:47.491 --> 00:59:47.851]  Welcome.
[00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:48.531]  Go ahead.
[00:59:48.931 --> 00:59:50.011]  I'm listening on the internet.
[00:59:50.111 --> 00:59:50.631]  Big fan.
[00:59:50.711 --> 00:59:52.112]  I've watched a lot of your videos.
[00:59:54.363 --> 00:59:57.025]  They're conditioning us up here in Canada right now.
[00:59:57.845 --> 01:00:07.531]  Ever since the Conservative minority government got elected, Mr. Harper, Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister up here, has been instituting rules that are like Bush-like.
[01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:11.273]  He wants the media to back off.
[01:00:11.313 --> 01:00:13.655]  He's eliminated certain things.
[01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:18.538]  He's brought down a top-down approach, the same way Bush did.
[01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:23.321]  He's only got a minority government, but he's acting completely like a
[01:00:24.065 --> 01:00:32.692]  Well, he's also a member of the Bilderberg Group, and it's reported that he's going to be attending the meeting on the 8th, 9th, and 10th in Ottawa.
[01:00:33.072 --> 01:00:34.693]  Exactly, and this is the other thing.
[01:00:35.814 --> 01:00:40.477]  He's trying to institute a Bush-like approach to everything, and he's only got a minority government.
[01:00:41.098 --> 01:00:45.421]  And so, in reality, if there wasn't something up his sleeve, he'd be...
[01:00:47.048 --> 01:00:55.453]  He's endangering his position, his government as a minority government, the way he's acting towards the media and the people, ignoring democratic procedures and stuff like that.
[01:00:56.114 --> 01:00:58.716]  Almost like he's got something up his sleeve.
[01:00:58.816 --> 01:01:05.740]  But he's supposedly conservative, but he's not retracting some of the gun control laws brought in by the, quote, liberals.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:14.846]  Oh no, in fact, he says he ran on eliminating it, but as soon as he got elected, of course, he said, oh, we can't eliminate it because the rest of the country would be upset, blah blah blah.
[01:01:15.259 --> 01:01:19.643]  And now they're just going to phase it in more efficiently.
[01:01:20.283 --> 01:01:36.216]  And lately we've had two parliamentary sessions where experts have gotten up and said, well, the conditions are set in Canada now for a terrorist attack here in Canada, just like in England in the subway system, from homegrown Al-Qaeda sympathizers.
[01:01:36.236 --> 01:01:37.817]  And he says, there's many of them.
[01:01:37.857 --> 01:01:38.818]  We know where they are.
[01:01:38.858 --> 01:01:39.739]  We know who they are.
[01:01:40.538 --> 01:01:42.580]  I'm thinking, oh jeez, I've heard this before.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.041]  But they can't bust them, though.
[01:01:44.341 --> 01:01:45.222]  No, of course not.
[01:01:45.782 --> 01:01:47.724]  But they can take all your freedoms, though.
[01:01:48.124 --> 01:01:50.686]  Well, it's just funny, especially with that Qadar thing.
[01:01:51.367 --> 01:01:59.193]  This Qadar kid, who was used by the CIA when he got wound up in Afghanistan, along with his little brother.
[01:01:59.213 --> 01:02:02.936]  His little brother, his 15-year-old brother, was sent down to Guantanamo.
[01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:08.901]  But this guy was 18 or 19 at the time, and he was used by the CIA to infiltrate
[01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:11.053]  Into Iraq and stuff.
[01:02:11.073 --> 01:02:17.095]  They said, well, we're gonna... If you play ball with us, you know, they rounded him up in one of those generic sweeps over in Afghanistan.
[01:02:17.135 --> 01:02:18.155]  He was over there with his dad.
[01:02:18.775 --> 01:02:35.578]  And they said, if you play ball with us, and pretend to be an Al-Qaeda terrorist, and go out and make all these statements, and tell your mom and dad, and your family members that you're a member of Al-Qaeda, and then that gets, you know, broadcast all over at home here.
[01:02:36.038 --> 01:02:38.759]  And so it's just, it's a psy-op.
[01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:40.962]  And they're doing it up here in Canada now.
[01:02:41.022 --> 01:02:46.764]  I know, they had a bunch of events where they bused supposed Al-Qaeda leaders, and then a month later you'll see it in the BBC.
[01:02:47.164 --> 01:02:50.225]  Oh, that was a staged arrest to protect the agents' anonymity.
[01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:51.985]  That wasn't a real Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:52.005 --> 01:02:52.786]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:53.246 --> 01:02:54.346]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:54.386 --> 01:02:58.968]  We'll get to Paul, another call in Canada here later, and Charles, and others.
[01:02:58.988 --> 01:03:00.428]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:00.448 --> 01:03:06.511]  We'll have open phones throughout this hour, but we've got a special guest coming up.
[01:03:06.551 --> 01:03:07.511]  He's put out a
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:16.067]  Detailed report here, getting into some of the bizarre goings on in Oklahoma.
[01:03:16.808 --> 01:03:21.332]  Terrorist training camps, bizarre CIA operations.
[01:03:21.992 --> 01:03:24.415]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[01:03:25.476 --> 01:03:30.740]  Don't forget we've got our big 9-11 symposium coming up June 24th and 25th.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.722]  Get your tickets now before they're all gone.
[01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.664]  They're starting to go really quick.
[01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:41.909]  Ray McGovern's going to be there, Professor Stephen Jones, Jim Fetzer, and so many others.
[01:03:42.629 --> 01:03:50.718]  Coming up, late next month, we're only, what, 24 days away from this conference kicking off, so get your tickets now.
[01:03:54.474 --> 01:03:57.336]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.596 --> 01:03:59.157]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.517 --> 01:04:04.200]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.521 --> 01:04:11.265]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.585 --> 01:04:13.565]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:16.606]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.706 --> 01:04:21.367]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:25.968]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.208 --> 01:04:33.450]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.111]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:38.011]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:54.384 --> 01:05:03.450]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:14.917]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:15.257 --> 01:05:20.981]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:21.201 --> 01:05:27.869]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.089 --> 01:05:34.917]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:35.178 --> 01:05:36.940]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.283]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:05:39.483 --> 01:05:40.424]  Get a two-pack for only $96.
[01:05:41.365 --> 01:05:42.446]  Gas prices are out of control.
[01:05:42.466 --> 01:05:44.987]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:48.128]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[01:05:48.148 --> 01:05:50.550]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using the
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:15.167]  The MPG Cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:20.033]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[01:06:20.213 --> 01:06:28.083]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money-saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG Cap.
[01:06:28.423 --> 01:06:28.483]  Yes!
[01:06:52.992 --> 01:06:58.034]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.394 --> 01:07:00.714]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:12.658 --> 01:07:16.239]  Colin Vanden Nieuwenhof is our guest.
[01:07:16.259 --> 01:07:17.419]  He lives up in Oklahoma.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.440]  He's friends with one of my employees, Kevin Smith.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.661]  He put out a really detailed report.
[01:07:23.576 --> 01:07:26.601]  We've talked a lot about this but a piece here a piece there
[01:07:36.736 --> 01:07:45.967]  Why were supposed Oklahoma City bombers trained in Oklahoma with government connections brought in by Bush Sr., former Iraqi Republican Guard?
[01:07:46.368 --> 01:07:50.813]  This is even in the Washington Times and Washington Post, folks, at the end of the Gulf War.
[01:07:50.893 --> 01:07:52.074]  Why were they involved in the bombing?
[01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:55.699]  Why did Nick Byrd, who supposedly got his head sawed off,
[01:07:56.623 --> 01:08:06.988]  In Iraq, just a few days after the Associated Press reported the FBI had him in custody and, quote, handed him over to a group that then gave him to Al-Qaeda.
[01:08:07.368 --> 01:08:08.889]  You see, this is all hidden in plain view.
[01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:18.073]  Why do we have Mr. Berg giving his laptop and laptop codes to one of the supposed hijackers of 9-11?
[01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:20.214]  Why were they trained at U.S.
[01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:21.475]  bases and flight schools?
[01:08:22.205 --> 01:08:24.926]  Well, these are spy training bases, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:25.347 --> 01:08:30.189]  And you have all these same individuals connected to each other over and over and over again.
[01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:37.013]  And Mr. Vanden Neuwenhoff has put together a detailed report, and I've read over it.
[01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:38.134]  It's all very factual.
[01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:41.475]  And we're going to try to break this down for you today.
[01:08:41.555 --> 01:08:43.336]  Holland, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:44.797]  You're welcome, Alex.
[01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:45.597]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:47.257 --> 01:08:54.523]  A thumbnail sketch, run through the whole story for us, the highlights, and then we'll go into more detail in each area.
[01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:58.927]  But, I mean, you started noticing all these connections, so you researched it.
[01:08:59.247 --> 01:09:00.128]  Break it down for us.
[01:09:00.989 --> 01:09:03.571]  Well, I'm a research assistant for OTR Productions.
[01:09:03.591 --> 01:09:05.853]  We're making a documentary on the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:09:06.365 --> 01:09:12.250]  In the course of this, we found some pretty interesting connections between 9-11 and the Oklahoma City Bonds.
[01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:20.157]  Same characters involved, same ARAT people who enjoy apparent immunity from prosecution took part in both events.
[01:09:21.017 --> 01:09:33.828]  And not only that, in examining the records and the documents of hijackers going in and out of Oklahoma, 9-11 hijackers traveling, training in Oklahoma,
[01:09:34.284 --> 01:09:46.308]  We found that there was a CIA agent, David Edger, who was in Germany monitoring the Hamburg cell, and then he traveled to Oklahoma, where they had their meeting here in Oklahoma City.
[01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:49.869]  The same hijackers he was watching in Germany, he was watching here in Oklahoma.
[01:09:50.709 --> 01:10:02.033]  And so that led me to believe that Oklahoma, for some reason, well, I can guess at the reason, is being used as some sort of support base for the state-sponsored terror.
[01:10:03.661 --> 01:10:11.492]  Now, we also have a SWAT, and we have Jim Loftus, Chief Anti-Terror Expert, retired now with the Justice Department, even going on Fox News.
[01:10:11.552 --> 01:10:13.976]  In fact, guys, dig that clip back out for me.
[01:10:13.996 --> 01:10:14.797]  I want to play that later.
[01:10:15.538 --> 01:10:19.101]  Coming out and talking about a SWAT being MI6 being protected.
[01:10:19.421 --> 01:10:24.024]  He's the supposed mastermind of the London bombings, but he's known MI6 being protected.
[01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:25.566]  He's in the U.S.
[01:10:26.266 --> 01:10:27.547]  in Washington State.
[01:10:27.927 --> 01:10:30.209]  The Justice Department and FBI want to bust him there.
[01:10:30.249 --> 01:10:31.870]  They're told back off, leave him alone.
[01:10:32.431 --> 01:10:41.097]  So over and over again, every time we find one of these terror nests, it turns out to be handled and controlled by Western intelligence.
[01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:42.959]  That's correct, Alex.
[01:10:42.999 --> 01:10:44.500]  You're talking about Harlan Oswald.
[01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:49.153]  His accomplices were tried for running an Al Qaeda camp in Washington State.
[01:10:49.193 --> 01:10:52.418]  Somehow he managed to escape from that, and that came to Britain.
[01:10:52.639 --> 01:10:54.902]  Supposedly masterminded the Lebanon bombings.
[01:10:54.942 --> 01:11:00.551]  That same modus operandi was used in 9-11, I mean, in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.172]  You see the same standard operating procedure.
[01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:07.076]  You see these people with apparent immunity getting away doing the same thing over and over.
[01:11:07.357 --> 01:11:11.181]  And we've got living together and driving around on buses together.
[01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:17.087]  Nick Berg, the young man who wanted to go help people with communications goodies.
[01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:18.949]  Classic CIA folks.
[01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:25.293]  Uh, traveling around in Iraq, and then clearly gets his head cut off inside Abu Ghraib.
[01:11:25.653 --> 01:11:27.795]  Same yellow walls, same white chairs.
[01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:31.837]  Uh, clearly Westerners dressed up like Arabs sawing his head off.
[01:11:32.438 --> 01:11:35.760]  Uh, forensics experts look at it and say the body was clearly already dead.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.663]  He'd probably been killed by a sniper or something in combat, and they probably just sawed his head off.
[01:11:40.683 --> 01:11:42.204]  Well, this will make him look like a patriot.
[01:11:42.585 --> 01:11:47.748]  I mean, Lord knows what really went on, but we've got Nick Berg, admittedly, with these guys too.
[01:11:47.808 --> 01:11:49.109]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:59.977]  Nicholas Berg, like you said, his laptop was used to email Zachary Mosawi in Minnesota, from Oklahoma to Minnesota, where Mosawi had recently moved.
[01:12:00.978 --> 01:12:15.229]  According to CNN and Nick Berg's father, the story is that Nick Berg lent his laptop to a complete stranger on a transit bus and gave him his password so this unknown party could email Mosawi.
[01:12:15.409 --> 01:12:18.572]  Nick Berg was of course investigated by the FBI for this.
[01:12:19.139 --> 01:12:20.262]  And of course he was cleared.
[01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:23.128]  But, I mean, for one thing, this was in 2001.
[01:12:23.309 --> 01:12:25.133]  Nick Burke wasn't even a student at OU then, and...
[01:12:26.827 --> 01:12:30.550]  Buses in Oklahoma, they did not have wireless technology in 2001.
[01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:31.411]  They did not.
[01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:37.716]  It's just a complete fabrication of a story, and this story is accepted by the media with no further examination.
[01:12:38.036 --> 01:12:39.097]  That's right.
[01:12:39.117 --> 01:12:44.582]  In 2001, wireless might be in your house or in your business, but there were no wireless networks on the roads.
[01:12:45.062 --> 01:12:50.427]  No one that I know, five, six years ago, was driving around with wireless laptops.
[01:12:51.047 --> 01:12:51.487]  No, no one.
[01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:54.510]  I mean, the technology was rare, if available at all.
[01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:59.585]  I mean, there weren't wireless networks on the roads is the point.
[01:13:00.046 --> 01:13:00.887]  Yes, you're correct.
[01:13:01.087 --> 01:13:04.833]  But it's the same people, look, I mean, it's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[01:13:05.274 --> 01:13:07.457]  We have the LA Times, the Washington Post,
[01:13:08.198 --> 01:13:15.080]  All admitting 5,000 Iraqi Republican Guard, 3,000 by Bush, 2,000 plus by Clinton, brought in.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.701]  They're in terror cells all over the U.S.
[01:13:17.741 --> 01:13:20.702]  They were trained in the 80s, brought back in, sheep-dipped.
[01:13:20.722 --> 01:13:21.382]  They're on U.S.
[01:13:21.402 --> 01:13:22.242]  government payroll.
[01:13:22.502 --> 01:13:23.802]  They're in every major city.
[01:13:23.842 --> 01:13:26.963]  They are ready to burn and blow up every major U.S.
[01:13:27.023 --> 01:13:28.944]  city if the government gives one order.
[01:13:29.504 --> 01:13:33.985]  And then there's plausible deniability, because if any of them get caught, oh, it's Arabs.
[01:13:34.045 --> 01:13:45.767]  I mean, we can really see this setup coming from a mile away, and Norman, Oklahoma, and a couple different flight schools and government bases, this seems to be the main nexus point for these operatives.
[01:13:46.167 --> 01:13:48.468]  So break down what's in your detailed report.
[01:13:49.748 --> 01:13:55.289]  Well, first of all, I break down all the terrorist activity in Norman, Oklahoma itself, because that has been the focus.
[01:13:55.309 --> 01:13:56.049]  That's my hometown.
[01:13:56.821 --> 01:14:00.862]  We had Muhammad Atta and Mohamed El-Sheikh training there as a pilot.
[01:14:01.402 --> 01:14:07.343]  We had Osama Bin Laden's personal pilot actually came there in Norman in 1993 to train at Airman Flight School.
[01:14:07.683 --> 01:14:13.404]  The FBI issued a memo about all these ARABs training in Oklahoma, called weapons of mass destruction, but nothing was done.
[01:14:14.024 --> 01:14:18.125]  Then, of course, Jackson Moussaoui came here in 2001 to train.
[01:14:18.145 --> 01:14:23.586]  And on OU campus, if you consult my report,
[01:14:25.848 --> 01:14:29.349]  The most insidious thing about this is the presence of CIA agent David Edger.
[01:14:30.369 --> 01:14:40.893]  He was in charge of the Hamburg cell that monitored Attaw and while Massali was talking to this apartment, while he was calling them, Edger was listening in.
[01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:45.394]  And what is strange about it is that Edger was not just a regular case officer.
[01:14:46.475 --> 01:14:50.756]  Prior to that, he had been the Deputy Director of Intelligence for Operations.
[01:14:51.383 --> 01:14:54.525]  of the CIA, which is the covert operations branch of the CIA.
[01:14:54.585 --> 01:14:56.566]  It's one of the highest positions in the agency.
[01:14:56.846 --> 01:15:04.109]  He took an apparent demotion to watch this little rinky-dink show in Hamburg, which in his own words, he said he heard nothing about it.
[01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:08.392]  He heard nothing of interest in that apartment while he was watching it for two years.
[01:15:09.232 --> 01:15:14.154]  And then he gets appointed to OU as a CIA officer in residence, not retired.
[01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:17.876]  He is the CIA man on campus at OU, University of Oklahoma.
[01:15:19.037 --> 01:15:19.177]  And
[01:15:20.094 --> 01:15:22.957]  He is present while Attah and Maselli have their meeting here in Oklahoma.
[01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:26.440]  He shepherded Attah from Germany to Oklahoma.
[01:15:26.941 --> 01:15:31.885]  We can only assume that he was running Oklahoma into things, or he was Attah's handler.
[01:15:31.905 --> 01:15:35.108]  I mean, that's just speculation, but that's the only thing that makes sense.
[01:15:35.328 --> 01:15:36.990]  Yeah, he's following these people around.
[01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.892]  Let's add some more background.
[01:15:38.932 --> 01:15:43.576]  We have the Dean of the Defense Language School going public saying Bush carried out 9-11
[01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:46.918]  San Jose Mercury News, and he's threatened with arrest.
[01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:47.578]  He shuts up.
[01:15:47.618 --> 01:15:52.700]  He says, we trained these guys in high-level spy training at the Defense Language School.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:57.222]  Then we have them trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal.
[01:15:57.562 --> 01:16:06.366]  Then we have two different embassies heads saying they were on terrorist watch lists, but they were ordered to let them, that is Al-Qaeda, Adda, and others, back into the U.S.
[01:16:06.386 --> 01:16:07.626]  We've interviewed them right here, folks.
[01:16:08.086 --> 01:16:09.427]  Let them back into the U.S.
[01:16:09.447 --> 01:16:11.928]  because, quote, they're part of an anti-terror training op.
[01:16:12.188 --> 01:16:14.189]  We know these guys were on the government payroll.
[01:16:15.157 --> 01:16:17.478]  I mean, we have it from every angle you can imagine.
[01:16:17.498 --> 01:16:20.979]  Please continue.
[01:16:22.039 --> 01:16:26.440]  Well, I mean, well, Edgar was watching a tie in Hamburg.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:31.442]  He was watching them in Oklahoma most probably, but this surveillance did nothing to stop the attacks.
[01:16:31.482 --> 01:16:34.783]  We can only assume that Edgar's mission, whatever it was, was successful.
[01:16:36.323 --> 01:16:38.864]  And going into Nicholasburg, I mean,
[01:16:40.699 --> 01:16:44.241]  I mean, that's not the only terrorist activity that occurred in Oklahoma.
[01:16:44.781 --> 01:16:48.742]  One of the plane tickets was purchased at an OU computer terminal for Ziad Jarrah.
[01:16:49.402 --> 01:17:00.166]  This despite the fact that Jarrah had been detained in Dubai not too long before this and questioned at the request of the CIA because they knew he was an allocated terrorist.
[01:17:00.467 --> 01:17:05.008]  He was released, he came to Oklahoma and purchased a ticket, but this raised no red flags.
[01:17:05.048 --> 01:17:09.510]  How come he can purchase a ticket in Dubai and be questioned, but he purchased a ticket
[01:17:10.282 --> 01:17:13.885]  In the United States, in Oklahoma, and nothing is done about it.
[01:17:14.425 --> 01:17:21.911]  And according to the librarian who witnessed the transaction, and told the FBI about it, the man who bought this ticket was not an Arab.
[01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:23.052]  He was a white American male.
[01:17:23.532 --> 01:17:24.973]  We have affidavits to support that.
[01:17:26.774 --> 01:17:29.296]  I mean, he was described as a skinhead.
[01:17:29.356 --> 01:17:33.479]  I mean, something really spooky is going on in Oklahoma, in Norman specifically.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.963]  And that motel that Moussaoui and Attal had their meeting in,
[01:17:38.502 --> 01:17:46.814]  In Oklahoma City was the same motel that, you know, six years previously, Ken McVeigh was seen in with Hussein Al-Husseini.
[01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:50.737]  A probable agent provocateur.
[01:17:50.937 --> 01:17:51.357]  Exactly.
[01:17:51.397 --> 01:17:52.097]  Let's go back.
[01:17:52.157 --> 01:18:04.141]  Then we have all these surveillance camera tapes and three separate trials that the government refuses to release, which FBI agents have told the LA Times shows the Hussein individual with McVeigh.
[01:18:04.481 --> 01:18:07.401]  Why don't the Feds want us to know that there are these Arabs involved?
[01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:10.302]  Because these are Arabs we know brought in by the U.S.
[01:18:10.362 --> 01:18:11.983]  government in their employ.
[01:18:12.023 --> 01:18:13.323]  That's part of the public record.
[01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:15.124]  So you start putting this together.
[01:18:15.144 --> 01:18:16.544]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:30.253]  If Hussein al-Husseini was a former supposedly Iraqi Republican Guard member, but there was also a story that he was jailed by Saddam Hussein, if that's true, we probably can guess who he was working for.
[01:18:31.094 --> 01:18:33.375]  And he was identified as John Doe number two.
[01:18:33.395 --> 01:18:38.199]  People saw him stepping out of the Ryder truck in front of the Murrah building after McVeigh left it.
[01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:42.862]  But they won't allow those tapes to be released, but we have FBI agents on record.
[01:18:42.922 --> 01:18:46.785]  So, we'll continue with more details, more facets of this
[01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:48.495]  Fascinating story.
[01:18:48.876 --> 01:18:49.978]  On the other side, stay with us.
[01:18:53.351 --> 01:18:58.634]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.915]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:19:01.155 --> 01:19:08.279]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:19.946]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:19:20.326 --> 01:19:21.607]  Its multi-voltage capability
[01:19:21.647 --> 01:19:22.247]  We're good to go!
[01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:52.630]  Currency devaluation.
[01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:56.031]  Inflation.
[01:19:56.051 --> 01:19:56.651]  One and the same.
[01:19:58.652 --> 01:20:03.373]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.294 --> 01:20:16.416]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:16.696 --> 01:20:18.517]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:18.577 --> 01:20:21.599]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.361]  Here is reality.
[01:20:24.741 --> 01:20:28.324]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:32.466]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.027 --> 01:20:35.868]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:20:37.202 --> 01:20:40.924]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:20:41.284 --> 01:20:42.445]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.465 --> 01:20:42.745]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.765 --> 01:20:46.167]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:05.501 --> 01:21:09.582]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:18.705]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:21:19.525 --> 01:21:24.847]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:21:24.867 --> 01:21:32.969]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:34.250]  Just call 1-800
[01:21:35.896 --> 01:21:35.916]  516-8736.
[01:21:35.936 --> 01:21:36.617]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:37.939]  It's absolutely free.
[01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.402]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:40.422 --> 01:21:41.022]  Just call right now.
[01:21:53.363 --> 01:21:55.224]  Gas prices are out of control.
[01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:59.605]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[01:21:59.966 --> 01:22:04.487]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:09.189]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using
[01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:15.475]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[01:22:15.635 --> 01:22:20.339]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:28.467]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG caps.
[01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:29.387]  I think so.
[01:22:59.457 --> 01:23:03.220]  We'll take some of your calls coming up in the next segment on this whole story.
[01:23:03.941 --> 01:23:13.928]  We'll play that little clip, too, of John Loftus on FOX talking about a SWAT being protected and working for MI6, Haroon, a SWAT.
[01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:17.952]  It's the same story, same people, same handlers.
[01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:23.236]  Holland, tell us about the head of the university there in Oklahoma.
[01:23:23.676 --> 01:23:25.778]  It's not just this David Edger.
[01:23:26.391 --> 01:23:32.595]  And then you guys also had folks that sat in on some of his classes where Edgar brags about what work he did.
[01:23:32.615 --> 01:23:33.575]  Tell us all about it.
[01:23:34.716 --> 01:23:42.321]  Well, first of all, the OU president is David Boren, who you probably know on the national scene.
[01:23:42.361 --> 01:23:48.885]  He was a senator from Oklahoma, he was former governor, and he served on the Senate Intelligence Committee as chairman.
[01:23:48.905 --> 01:23:54.248]  He had the longest tenure in Senate history as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:23:56.012 --> 01:23:57.353]  He's also Skull and Bones.
[01:23:57.713 --> 01:24:03.314]  That is correct, he's Skull and Bones.
[01:24:03.335 --> 01:24:12.957]  He is the one who personally appointed David Edger to OU in the weeks prior to 9-11 in the summer of 2001.
[01:24:12.997 --> 01:24:15.498]  And David Boren is a deceptive person.
[01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:16.298]  First of all, he is gay.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.802]  And that's a rumor in Oklahoma and people know it.
[01:24:26.142 --> 01:24:26.943]  Some people don't.
[01:24:27.523 --> 01:24:34.328]  But a book came out in 1994 by his former Oxford roommate detailing his homosexuality, which is fine.
[01:24:34.388 --> 01:24:39.491]  I don't care about anyone's sexual orientation, but the deceptiveness about it is what irks me.
[01:24:40.552 --> 01:24:45.875]  And that's probably why David Boren chose not to run for re-election in 1994.
[01:24:45.915 --> 01:24:50.198]  That was kind of a surprise move for a very powerful man in the Senate.
[01:24:51.824 --> 01:24:55.547]  And David Bourne runs a pretty tight ship at OU.
[01:24:55.687 --> 01:25:04.014]  There's pretty much a culture of fear among the campus paper and the faculty and so forth.
[01:25:04.034 --> 01:25:10.379]  And there's a lot of research by Michael P. Wright into his shenanigans on campus and favoring certain young men.
[01:25:10.399 --> 01:25:13.622]  I mean, it's really just a sad story.
[01:25:15.504 --> 01:25:25.527]  I don't want to sound like, you know, I'm trying to spread gossip about the man, but this is... I don't want to, you know, frankly, I want to stick to the terrorism stuff, but we've got all this weird stuff going on, is your point?
[01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:42.431]  Yeah, and let me just add one more thing, that according to Al Martin's conspirators, a book, David Boren was compromised in 1984 by the intelligence community because of his proclivity, so I mean... Well, that sounds like it's par for the course, so that's why you brought it up.
[01:25:43.032 --> 01:25:49.917]  CIA blackmail schemes against Congress and so forth, they've been in the paper, I mean, the Washington Post, all that, in the 80s.
[01:25:50.298 --> 01:25:51.238]  Sure, I understand.
[01:25:51.479 --> 01:26:04.128]  Getting back into just this whole plethora of buzzards circling the area there in Norman, Oklahoma, why do you think they've chosen this as a base of operations for these patsies and decoys?
[01:26:04.869 --> 01:26:07.751]  Well, obviously it's safe ground to conduct covert operations.
[01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:11.574]  The Oklahoma City bombing happened here, and we all know the reams of evidence
[01:26:12.276 --> 01:26:13.737]  That proved the government was lying about that.
[01:26:13.797 --> 01:26:14.197]  And you know what?
[01:26:14.217 --> 01:26:14.917]  They got away with it.
[01:26:15.197 --> 01:26:18.058]  The local media in Oklahoma is very tightly controlled.
[01:26:18.538 --> 01:26:25.981]  They dropped all those stories investigating Hussein al-Husseini, talking about second and third bombs found at the building.
[01:26:26.441 --> 01:26:27.741]  All of those stories were dropped.
[01:26:27.821 --> 01:26:30.482]  It's like those reporters on TV never said those things.
[01:26:30.502 --> 01:26:32.023]  Those words never came out of their mouths.
[01:26:33.003 --> 01:26:36.464]  And so the media is in the establishment's pocket.
[01:26:36.504 --> 01:26:39.785]  The law enforcement community in Oklahoma is compromised.
[01:26:40.386 --> 01:26:41.686]  They cooperated with the cover-up.
[01:26:42.139 --> 01:26:51.826]  of the Oklahoma City bombing, and those individual officers who chose to tell the truth were punished, sent before punishment boards, forced retirements, harassment, or murdered.
[01:26:52.547 --> 01:26:57.990]  And Terrence Yackey was murdered in a very bloody manner, and his death served as an example.
[01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:02.714]  And I've talked to police officers who are scared because of what happened to Yackey.
[01:27:03.775 --> 01:27:04.595]  Very scared.
[01:27:04.655 --> 01:27:10.139]  I've had a police officer cry in front of me because of what I revealed had happened to Yackey.
[01:27:12.133 --> 01:27:12.933]  This is safe ground.
[01:27:12.953 --> 01:27:20.577]  They got away with it in Oklahoma City and nothing by the law enforcement or media in this state was done, so that's why they continue to use it.
[01:27:20.597 --> 01:27:23.839]  So you talk to officers and they know what's going on, but they're scared?
[01:27:24.359 --> 01:27:24.899]  They're scared.
[01:27:24.959 --> 01:27:25.359]  They know.
[01:27:25.439 --> 01:27:28.181]  They know beyond a doubt what happened.
[01:27:28.241 --> 01:27:36.745]  Not all of them, but the ones who knew Yakey and knew what he was trying to reveal, what he was trying to talk about, he was the first officer to respond to the bombing.
[01:27:37.045 --> 01:27:38.125]  Yeah, he was cop of the year.
[01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:41.527]  Yes, and he was an outstanding officer in every way.
[01:27:42.577 --> 01:27:46.900]  He was, I've talked to his family members, he was an outstanding man in every way.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.863]  And because of that, he chose to uphold his oath to protect the public.
[01:27:50.903 --> 01:27:51.664]  He would not lie.
[01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:55.346]  He would not forget what he had seen in that building.
[01:27:56.247 --> 01:27:58.148]  And he paid the price for it, unfortunately.
[01:27:58.168 --> 01:28:03.532]  We're going to go to break here in just a moment.
[01:28:03.853 --> 01:28:10.958]  Holland, what are some of the other key points that you make in this essay you've written, which is excellent, that you'd like to relate to the listeners when we get back?
[01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:25.577]  Well, I'd just like to talk about the fact that this Al-Qaeda cell in Oklahoma, Warren Norman, is operating under protection and is probably going to be used again in the future, a la the Heinrich Suicide Bombing, which I believe was a foul-up.
[01:28:26.297 --> 01:28:30.480]  That's right, we've got the young man blowing himself up at a football game, that was kept very quiet.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:36.763]  Now, folks, they'll take a jackhammer and make it national news, or a WMD attack,
[01:28:38.328 --> 01:28:40.511]  Why did they clamp down on that so fast?
[01:28:40.591 --> 01:28:41.733]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.754 --> 01:28:42.675]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.697 --> 01:28:44.599]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.079 --> 01:28:46.682]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.604 --> 01:28:50.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:56.285]  What has been deemed the healthiest oil on the earth?
[01:28:56.845 --> 01:28:57.985]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[01:28:58.305 --> 01:29:00.686]  What did Woman's Day Magazine call the miracle oil?
[01:29:01.206 --> 01:29:02.286]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[01:29:02.726 --> 01:29:08.088]  Why have people reported increased energy, reduction in food craving, and an easier time losing weight?
[01:29:08.548 --> 01:29:09.868]  Virgin Coconut Oil!
[01:29:10.169 --> 01:29:11.129]  The answer is clear!
[01:29:11.489 --> 01:29:14.310]  It's time to switch to Virgin Coconut Oil by Nourishing Planet.
[01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:20.031]  Made from organic coconuts, Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil is produced in the pristine Fiji Islands.
[01:29:20.471 --> 01:29:22.312]  Using coconuts within hours of opening,
[01:29:22.692 --> 01:29:29.857]  Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil retains more of the nutrition, including the tocotrienols, which are powerful vitamin E antioxidants.
[01:29:30.197 --> 01:29:35.121]  The minimally processed coconuts allow for delightful taste and the aroma of fresh coconuts.
[01:29:35.681 --> 01:29:40.204]  Order your Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil by visiting Ecoviva.com.
[01:29:40.585 --> 01:29:43.647]  That's E-C-O-V-I-V-A dot com.
[01:29:44.127 --> 01:29:44.868]  Or call 1-866-680-8484.
[01:29:44.888 --> 01:29:45.268]  That's 1-866-680-8484.
[01:29:53.277 --> 01:29:55.239]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.339 --> 01:30:06.047]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.427 --> 01:30:10.950]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:22.359]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:22.939 --> 01:30:29.786]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.187 --> 01:30:32.329]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:37.775]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.075 --> 01:30:44.380]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:48.644]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:48.864 --> 01:30:49.625]  That's toll free.
[01:30:49.645 --> 01:30:49.685]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:57.991]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:30:58.251 --> 01:31:01.854]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:31:01.994 --> 01:31:10.120]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:16.004]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:21.546]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:31:21.806 --> 01:31:23.886]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:31:24.146 --> 01:31:36.290]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:40.971]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:31:41.171 --> 01:31:42.131]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:42.311 --> 01:31:43.931]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:31:44.051 --> 01:31:45.852]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:31:46.112 --> 01:31:46.572]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:31:46.592 --> 01:31:46.812]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:31:46.892 --> 01:31:47.752]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:47.772 --> 01:31:49.072]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:19.591]  Nick Berg, 9-11 hijackers, Oklahoma City bombers, all in Norman, Oklahoma.
[01:32:21.093 --> 01:32:23.877]  CIA high-level agents fluttering around.
[01:32:24.919 --> 01:32:28.384]  Former heads of Senate Intelligence Committees, the heads of the University.
[01:32:29.392 --> 01:32:32.214]  All of this happening, the same MO over and over again.
[01:32:32.654 --> 01:32:49.162]  Here's Mr. Loftus, who we interviewed, and of course he said even more on this show, but here's the Fox News clip where the former Justice Department anti-terrorism chief expert talked about how Haroon Aswad was being protected by key elements of the CIA and MI6.
[01:32:51.423 --> 01:32:52.946]  From the FBI and others.
[01:32:52.986 --> 01:32:55.170]  Because again, these entire agencies aren't doing this.
[01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:57.534]  It's certain key compartments that are doing it.
[01:32:57.834 --> 01:32:59.096]  Compartments at the top.
[01:32:59.457 --> 01:33:01.180]  Let's roll this little Fox News clip.
[01:33:05.504 --> 01:33:10.848]  Of all the bombings in London, on the 7-7 and 7-21, this is the guy, we think.
[01:33:11.289 --> 01:33:22.477]  This is THE guy, and what's really embarrassing is that the entire British police are out chasing him, and one wing of the British government, MI6, or the British Secret Service, has been hiding him.
[01:33:22.917 --> 01:33:27.681]  And this has been a real source of contention between CIA, Justice Department, and Britain.
[01:33:27.701 --> 01:33:28.402]  Hold on, John.
[01:33:28.522 --> 01:33:29.763]  MI6 has been hiding him.
[01:33:29.803 --> 01:33:32.445]  Are you saying that he has been working for them?
[01:33:33.633 --> 01:33:34.553]  Oh, I'm not saying it.
[01:33:34.894 --> 01:33:39.435]  This is what the Muslim sheikh said in an interview in a British newspaper back in 2001.
[01:33:39.475 --> 01:33:41.216]  So he's a double agent?
[01:33:41.556 --> 01:33:41.816]  Or what?
[01:33:41.836 --> 01:33:42.937]  He's a double agent.
[01:33:44.277 --> 01:33:49.599]  So he's working for the Brits to try to give them information about Al-Qaeda, but in reality he's still an Al-Qaeda operative?
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:50.560]  Yeah.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:34:01.404]  The CIA and the Israelis all accused MI6 of letting all these terrorists live in London, not because they were getting Al-Qaeda information, but for appeasement.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.822]  It was one of those, you leave us alone and we leave you alone kind of things.
[01:34:05.062 --> 01:34:06.704]  Well, we left him alone too long then.
[01:34:07.644 --> 01:34:08.265]  Absolutely.
[01:34:08.405 --> 01:34:11.287]  Now, we knew about this guy Oswald back in 1999.
[01:34:11.788 --> 01:34:12.788]  He came to America.
[01:34:13.209 --> 01:34:20.034]  The Justice Department wanted to indict him in Seattle because him and his buddy were trying to set up a terrorist training school in Oregon.
[01:34:20.074 --> 01:34:21.415]  So they indicted his buddy, right?
[01:34:21.475 --> 01:34:22.636]  But why didn't they indict him?
[01:34:23.436 --> 01:34:25.238]  Well, it comes out, we've just learned,
[01:34:26.022 --> 01:34:27.704]  That the headquarters of the U.S.
[01:34:27.744 --> 01:34:32.468]  Justice Department ordered the Seattle prosecutors not to touch Oswalt.
[01:34:32.548 --> 01:34:33.328]  Hello!
[01:34:33.528 --> 01:34:34.950]  Now hold on.
[01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:35.230]  Why?
[01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:39.033]  Well, apparently Oswalt was working for British Intelligence.
[01:34:39.694 --> 01:34:45.719]  Now Oswalt's boss, the one-armed Captain Hook, he gets indicted two years later.
[01:34:46.379 --> 01:34:49.482]  So the guy above him and below him get indicted, but not Oswalt.
[01:34:50.316 --> 01:34:52.298]  Now, there's a split of opinion within U.S.
[01:34:52.338 --> 01:34:52.798]  intelligence.
[01:34:52.818 --> 01:34:55.780]  Some people say that the British intelligence fibbed to us.
[01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:57.702]  They told us that Aswat was dead.
[01:34:58.323 --> 01:35:00.524]  And that's why the New York Group dropped the case.
[01:35:01.105 --> 01:35:03.066]  That's not what most of the Justice Department thinks.
[01:35:03.267 --> 01:35:09.572]  They think that it was just, again, covering up for this very publicly affiliated guy with al-Mujarraf.
[01:35:09.592 --> 01:35:11.013]  He was a British intelligence plant.
[01:35:11.573 --> 01:35:12.294]  So all of a sudden,
[01:35:13.286 --> 01:35:14.027]  He disappears.
[01:35:14.207 --> 01:35:15.248]  He's in South Africa.
[01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:16.430]  We think he's dead.
[01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:17.311]  We don't know he's down there.
[01:35:17.771 --> 01:35:21.436]  Last month, the South African Secret Service come across the guy.
[01:35:21.456 --> 01:35:22.557]  Yeah, now CIA says... He's alive!
[01:35:22.597 --> 01:35:23.278]  Oh, he's alive!
[01:35:23.759 --> 01:35:25.641]  Our CIA says, okay, let's arrest him.
[01:35:25.841 --> 01:35:27.102]  But the Brits say no again?
[01:35:27.122 --> 01:35:28.965]  The Brits say no.
[01:35:28.985 --> 01:35:30.767]  Now, at this point...
[01:35:31.576 --> 01:35:36.222]  Two weeks ago, the Brits know that the CIA wants to get a hold of Haroon.
[01:35:36.262 --> 01:35:36.862]  So what happens?
[01:35:37.303 --> 01:35:38.044]  He takes off again.
[01:35:38.504 --> 01:35:39.466]  Goes right to London.
[01:35:39.846 --> 01:35:41.128]  He isn't arrested when he lands.
[01:35:41.548 --> 01:35:42.669]  He isn't arrested when he leaves.
[01:35:42.689 --> 01:35:43.811]  Even though he's on a watch list.
[01:35:44.477 --> 01:35:45.518]  He's on the watch list!
[01:35:46.098 --> 01:35:49.540]  The only reason he could get away with that was if he was working for British Intelligence.
[01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:50.961]  He was a wanted man.
[01:35:50.981 --> 01:35:55.885]  Alright, so there's the clip from FOX with Mr. Loptis.
[01:35:56.345 --> 01:36:00.668]  We're talking to Holland Vanden Heuvelhoff and he's our guest.
[01:36:00.708 --> 01:36:02.189]  He's of course a former Marine.
[01:36:02.879 --> 01:36:07.963]  And local activists in Oklahoma City, investigative journalists out there, freelancing, getting the truth out.
[01:36:08.084 --> 01:36:19.113]  He's got this big detailed report, Oklahoma, the Axis of Evil, expanded exclusively for Infowars.com, originally published for Cerebellum.tv.
[01:36:19.413 --> 01:36:21.595]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:36:22.656 --> 01:36:27.280]  Hanlon, I'd like your permission to add a little bit to the headlines so people know exactly what it is they're looking at.
[01:36:28.531 --> 01:36:40.687]  I'd like to, okay, then I'll add a sub-headline to it, you know, Giant Government Terror Training Nest in Oklahoma, Protecting Terrorists, how does that sub-headline sound to you, something like that?
[01:36:40.707 --> 01:36:42.450]  That sounds very appropriate.
[01:36:43.392 --> 01:36:46.433]  We're about to go to some calls, but bottom line, you've been studying this.
[01:36:46.473 --> 01:36:48.694]  Everything in your article is checked out from my research.
[01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:49.974]  In fact, it's even worse.
[01:36:50.394 --> 01:36:51.815]  We've got this whole history of this.
[01:36:52.555 --> 01:36:53.655]  We know they're being protected.
[01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:58.357]  I've had other police detectives and many others on this show, FBI, lawyers, who've covered this.
[01:36:58.697 --> 01:37:01.998]  We know there's 5,000 Iraqis trained in the 80s here, brought back.
[01:37:02.838 --> 01:37:07.002]  They were double agents against Saddam, even when he was our ally, brought back in.
[01:37:07.042 --> 01:37:12.106]  They're now being used to deal narcotics, weapons, to finance their operations.
[01:37:12.887 --> 01:37:16.130]  Every time cops bust them, the Feds tell them, let them go.
[01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:18.091]  We know they're in every major city.
[01:37:18.111 --> 01:37:23.236]  We know they're in Austin, they're in Dallas, they're in Houston, they're in Oklahoma, they're in LA, they're in Detroit, they're in New York.
[01:37:23.696 --> 01:37:26.437]  The globalists give the order, and these people start blowing stuff up.
[01:37:26.617 --> 01:37:28.078]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:37:28.158 --> 01:37:29.999]  Our government's using and controlling these guys?
[01:37:30.039 --> 01:37:31.520]  Or do you want to add anything to that?
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.400]  Give us the big picture.
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:39.243]  I totally agree, but you know, the fact is, these guys that are being used, they may not even know who they're working for.
[01:37:39.283 --> 01:37:44.986]  They may actually believe that they're working for Osama Bin Laden, or Muslim Jihadists, or whatever.
[01:37:45.006 --> 01:37:51.689]  I mean, that's the principle of intelligence operations, is that the operators, the limited hangout guys that you
[01:37:52.236 --> 01:37:57.271]  That you offer out there a sacrifice, really have no clue as to who their true master is.
[01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.119]  And because that offers possible deniability.
[01:38:00.822 --> 01:38:03.724]  And it also offers a limited hangout if they should get caught.
[01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:12.850]  Well, David Edger is a super high-level CIA agent involved in covert operations worldwide, very senior in the CIA, right before 9-11.
[01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:15.172]  He shows up clearly as a handler.
[01:38:15.472 --> 01:38:17.754]  He's involved there, and then boom, all this happens.
[01:38:17.794 --> 01:38:19.495]  I mean, this stinks to high heaven.
[01:38:20.035 --> 01:38:23.137]  And again, we have Nick Berg as a satellite of all of this.
[01:38:23.157 --> 01:38:24.838]  It just never ends.
[01:38:25.579 --> 01:38:29.982]  Yes, I mean, like David Edger, a colleague of mine went to David Edger's class at OU.
[01:38:30.618 --> 01:38:33.699]  He admitted to watching Muhammad Atta in Hamburg, Germany.
[01:38:34.479 --> 01:38:40.680]  He admitted to it, but he quickly undercut any questions as to, you know, hear anything interesting.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:43.480]  And he said he heard nothing of interest.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.221]  You're on a cell phone, aren't you?
[01:38:45.821 --> 01:38:46.341]  Yes, I am.
[01:38:46.361 --> 01:38:46.821]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:47.201 --> 01:38:48.761]  It's cutting out real bad.
[01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:49.661]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:49.841 --> 01:38:50.582]  No, you're back now.
[01:38:50.642 --> 01:38:51.342]  Repeat what you said.
[01:38:51.802 --> 01:38:52.562]  Okay.
[01:38:53.102 --> 01:38:58.643]  A colleague of mine went to this class, and he admitted to watching Muhammad Atta in Hamburg, Germany.
[01:38:59.406 --> 01:39:01.008]  And, uh, buddy, you're hurting up here.
[01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.291]  Did it again.
[01:39:04.351 --> 01:39:04.972]  Stop right there.
[01:39:05.012 --> 01:39:06.774]  We may not be able to continue.
[01:39:07.515 --> 01:39:09.156]  Are you in the same spot you were earlier?
[01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:10.217]  No.
[01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:10.898]  We'll go back.
[01:39:11.539 --> 01:39:11.839]  No, no, no.
[01:39:11.859 --> 01:39:15.162]  I mean, are you in the same spot physically with your cell phone?
[01:39:15.763 --> 01:39:16.504]  Uh, no, I'm not.
[01:39:16.524 --> 01:39:17.485]  We're headed back right now.
[01:39:19.022 --> 01:39:19.362]  All right.
[01:39:20.083 --> 01:39:20.483]  Let me do this.
[01:39:20.503 --> 01:39:23.385]  Let me try to take a few calls and we'll see if it gets better in just a moment.
[01:39:23.826 --> 01:39:25.667]  Stay right there, Holland.
[01:39:26.428 --> 01:39:27.088]  Let's go ahead.
[01:39:27.108 --> 01:39:28.850]  These will be all over the map, but that's okay.
[01:39:29.290 --> 01:39:31.812]  Paul in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:32.372]  You're on the air.
[01:39:32.412 --> 01:39:32.953]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:39:33.533 --> 01:39:34.414]  Hi Alex.
[01:39:35.014 --> 01:39:36.115]  Excellent, excellent show.
[01:39:37.853 --> 01:39:39.474]  I just had a few points to make.
[01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.695]  The previous call from Canada is right.
[01:39:42.196 --> 01:39:44.337]  We are being pretty much conditioned.
[01:39:45.518 --> 01:39:51.301]  The media here, they would never report anything that you report on.
[01:39:51.321 --> 01:39:55.624]  Global or Canwest is the biggest media company here.
[01:39:55.684 --> 01:39:57.425]  They reach 94% of Canada.
[01:39:58.445 --> 01:40:02.488]  Half of the board is Jewish and they always seem to show that
[01:40:03.499 --> 01:40:10.743]  That extra 10 minutes of what's going on in Israel and Palestine when most people here don't even really care and they refuse to report on anything big.
[01:40:11.564 --> 01:40:12.584]  I just had a few other points.
[01:40:14.685 --> 01:40:19.748]  In Vancouver, I'm telling you the New World Order is coming, the North American Union is coming.
[01:40:19.768 --> 01:40:26.032]  You know, a few months ago I saw a military ban with a United States military plate on it.
[01:40:26.545 --> 01:40:29.669]  Speeding in the HOV lane with only one occupant.
[01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:32.012]  And I'm thinking to myself, well what the hell is going on here?
[01:40:32.052 --> 01:40:32.994]  What's this guy doing here?
[01:40:33.094 --> 01:40:34.596]  Well sir, they've signed agreements.
[01:40:34.836 --> 01:40:35.817]  You have U.S.
[01:40:35.857 --> 01:40:36.819]  State Police.
[01:40:37.552 --> 01:40:44.255]  From even Texas up in Canada running quote checkpoints to quote teach your police how to operate.
[01:40:44.335 --> 01:40:50.198]  Now American cops are sent around our hemisphere to train people on how to set up a police state.
[01:40:50.258 --> 01:40:51.878]  That's how pathetic we are.
[01:40:51.918 --> 01:40:57.181]  It's been in your papers that the American Union is forming the CFR documents being implemented.
[01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:01.663]  That's what this legalization of all these illegals Bush is pushing is all about.
[01:41:01.723 --> 01:41:02.203]  Anything else?
[01:41:02.819 --> 01:41:07.321]  Well, um, yeah, um, also, uh, last year I was disgusted.
[01:41:07.521 --> 01:41:17.326]  The Drug Enforcement Agency came up here into Vancouver and basically shoved their way in and busted somebody for a, you know, a questionable crime.
[01:41:17.346 --> 01:41:18.547]  I wouldn't even call it a crime.
[01:41:18.587 --> 01:41:19.968]  Selling seeds of marijuana.
[01:41:20.628 --> 01:41:21.989]  You know, there's a debate in itself.
[01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:23.589]  And also, I just had a question for you.
[01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:27.872]  Um, how long before, um, they start to try and chip us?
[01:41:28.372 --> 01:41:32.414]  Because I figure there's between five and ten years left before... Alright, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:41:33.405 --> 01:41:38.057]  Everybody's always freaking out over the chips, and I've been talking about it long before most people were.
[01:41:38.718 --> 01:41:41.946]  They're going to make prisoners do it, old people, when you go in the hospital.
[01:41:43.101 --> 01:41:47.404]  They're going to start phasing it in, and really, that comes after the big terror attack.
[01:41:47.764 --> 01:41:49.345]  Three or four more big terror attacks.
[01:41:49.746 --> 01:42:00.253]  Because after every terror attack, they take more freedom, and the next attack's bigger, and they take more freedom, and the next attack's bigger, they take even more freedom, and they've got to condition you to, that's always the answer, give up your freedom.
[01:42:00.653 --> 01:42:03.415]  But no, there really is a governmental, institutional move
[01:42:03.955 --> 01:42:06.536]  To push implantable, trackable RFID chips.
[01:42:06.856 --> 01:42:07.596]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:42:07.656 --> 01:42:09.057]  Your cell phone already tracks you.
[01:42:09.497 --> 01:42:11.498]  RFID and products already tracks you.
[01:42:11.798 --> 01:42:19.280]  We're on the verge in Texas of having RFID tracker chips in all of our inspection stickers to tax us and track us and trace us.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.460]  So all of that's going in.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.761]  It's already here, sir.
[01:42:22.081 --> 01:42:23.101]  That's when it's going to start.
[01:42:23.221 --> 01:42:23.961]  It's already here.
[01:42:24.342 --> 01:42:28.443]  And the media kind of uses the microchipping us physically in our flesh
[01:42:29.219 --> 01:42:33.022]  As the extreme to make all the other bad stuff they do not look as bad.
[01:42:33.362 --> 01:42:38.686]  Going back to our guest, Holland Vanden Nieuwenhoff.
[01:42:39.446 --> 01:42:41.768]  Sir, are you in a better cell position now?
[01:42:42.448 --> 01:42:43.229]  Can you hear me now?
[01:42:43.269 --> 01:42:43.789]  Yes, I can.
[01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:53.376]  What do you think about all, you know, just the general police state that's going into the US right now, but nothing being done with our borders except more smoke and mirrors?
[01:42:54.216 --> 01:42:54.657]  Well, I mean,
[01:42:55.501 --> 01:43:08.229]  Just watching the 9-11 hijackers that are moving through Oklahoma into the United States, while they were known Al-Qaeda terrorists, most of these hijackers, I mean at least Mohammed Atta had been identified by Able Danger as an Al-Qaeda cell leader.
[01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:18.515]  The other hijackers, one hijacker, Nawaf Al-Hamzi, got a speeding ticket in Oklahoma, despite the fact that he had been known as an Al-Qaeda terrorist since January of 2000.
[01:43:19.688 --> 01:43:20.910]  Allowed into this country.
[01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:22.812]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:43:22.832 --> 01:43:30.363]  They want to restrict our civil liberties and punish the citizenry for their apparent fallops while we have Al Qaeda terrorists.
[01:43:30.902 --> 01:43:34.583]  Flitting in and out of the country, I will, getting issued visas despite terrorist connections.
[01:43:35.023 --> 01:43:37.404]  It's just, the dichotomy is maddening.
[01:43:37.444 --> 01:43:42.785]  But they call the embassy head up and say, we don't care if he's red flagged, he works for us.
[01:43:42.945 --> 01:43:46.666]  You see, we've got it from every angle that they work for the U.S.
[01:43:46.786 --> 01:43:48.566]  government, and knowingly, folks.
[01:43:49.006 --> 01:43:50.867]  Let's talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:43:50.907 --> 01:43:51.987]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:43:52.047 --> 01:43:52.527]  Go ahead.
[01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:53.648]  Yes, sir, Mr. Jones.
[01:43:53.968 --> 01:43:59.729]  I want to report that ABC lost, uh, they, uh, broadcasters got hit.
[01:44:00.376 --> 01:44:01.237]  And they're dead.
[01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:02.238]  Two died.
[01:44:02.378 --> 01:44:03.300]  Yeah, two of them died.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.321]  Others got wounded.
[01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:04.581]  Yes.
[01:44:04.901 --> 01:44:05.682]  That was yesterday.
[01:44:05.983 --> 01:44:06.223]  Yes.
[01:44:07.084 --> 01:44:08.506]  How do you think they feel about that?
[01:44:08.526 --> 01:44:09.907]  Do they feel affected by that?
[01:44:09.987 --> 01:44:10.909]  Or does it matter to them?
[01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:14.413]  You know, CBS, I mean, they lied to us anyway.
[01:44:15.157 --> 01:44:16.117]  Should we care about it?
[01:44:17.078 --> 01:44:18.198]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:44:19.258 --> 01:44:26.481]  The official U.S.-Israeli plan was to go into Iraq, break it down into three to four sections, have civil war.
[01:44:27.001 --> 01:44:36.204]  So when you hear we're failing, no, they mean our troops to die, they mean it to be a quagmire while they build the bases, to then ratchet up the next level into Iran.
[01:44:36.744 --> 01:44:44.046]  And so that's why generals were always getting replaced every three or four months, because they'd try to actually fix things and they'd say, no, you're fired.
[01:44:44.466 --> 01:44:48.587]  We could have gone in there, got the lights on, got a government in, and none of this would have happened.
[01:44:48.607 --> 01:44:57.529]  But our government has been caught, along with the Israelis and the British, bombing mosques, stirring stuff up, and then once they stirred it up, now it's really falling apart on its own.
[01:44:57.889 --> 01:44:59.610]  Our troops can't leave the green zone.
[01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:01.590]  It is all by design.
[01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:03.411]  In fact, you're a former Marine.
[01:45:03.731 --> 01:45:05.011]  Holland, you want to comment on this?
[01:45:06.131 --> 01:45:07.612]  It's just a sad situation.
[01:45:07.632 --> 01:45:11.373]  I mean, I feel for my comrades in arms, you know.
[01:45:12.393 --> 01:45:13.113]  It's really
[01:45:13.717 --> 01:45:15.497]  You know, it was just Memorial Day yesterday.
[01:45:15.857 --> 01:45:19.278]  When you're in the military, you really do not have a mind of your own.
[01:45:19.618 --> 01:45:36.442]  Your condition to kill and to survive in a hostile environment and feelings of, you know, distrust of authority and reason and sympathy, empathy with your fellow human being, and actually with the enemy, are just not allowed in that survival mechanism, especially in a war zone.
[01:45:38.252 --> 01:45:43.355]  These troops coming back, I've talked to some of them, and they're confused about what's going on over there, but they're still going to help you.
[01:45:43.395 --> 01:45:54.600]  They cannot admit that their sacrifice was in vain, that they were tools, that their buddies died, you know, for a bunch of rich white guys who got out of Vietnam when they had their chance.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.282]  You know, they just will not, psychologically, they cannot admit that
[01:45:59.185 --> 01:46:01.126]  Our soldiers are dying in vain over there.
[01:46:01.306 --> 01:46:02.806]  But the official U.S.
[01:46:02.847 --> 01:46:09.809]  government battle plan said, balkanization strategy, break the place up, we want civil war.
[01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:13.671]  Again, people think Bush is failing and is in a miserable job.
[01:46:13.911 --> 01:46:16.332]  He has executed the entire operation.
[01:46:16.572 --> 01:46:22.074]  He's getting rid of our borders, he's got us in a quagmire, he's doing everything he was supposed to do.
[01:46:22.094 --> 01:46:24.195]  I agree.
[01:46:24.355 --> 01:46:26.976]  I mean, it's just, you know,
[01:46:27.421 --> 01:46:35.403]  The only logical reason for the tremendous incompetence on the part of the military in Iraq is the fact that they are allowing this to happen.
[01:46:35.423 --> 01:46:42.244]  There is no reason in the world the stupendous mistakes that Rumsfeld has supposedly made, that generals are criticizing him for.
[01:46:42.804 --> 01:46:44.144]  Rumsfeld's not a dumb man.
[01:46:44.364 --> 01:46:45.905]  He didn't get to where he is by being dumb.
[01:46:45.925 --> 01:46:52.166]  I mean, the things that have ratcheted up the civil war in Iraq have been classical
[01:46:53.087 --> 01:46:53.889]  By the way, by the way,
[01:47:09.404 --> 01:47:20.730]  They know in the handbook 101 that you don't just go into the farming belts and bulldoze every date palm, every tangerine orchard, to quote, teach the people a lesson.
[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:24.391]  Everything they did was textbook to make people revolt.
[01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:26.232]  Exactly.
[01:47:26.332 --> 01:47:28.693]  I mean, it's really a sad situation.
[01:47:28.713 --> 01:47:29.974]  I didn't realize that until recently.
[01:47:30.014 --> 01:47:33.756]  I was just so, I was actually kind of, you know, enlightened by the fact that
[01:47:34.913 --> 01:47:38.095]  ...that our plans were not working in Iraq, but then I realized this is the plan.
[01:47:38.115 --> 01:47:39.035]  This is what they want.
[01:47:39.315 --> 01:47:45.938]  Well, sir, we have an 83 Israeli document, we have a 99 Pentagon document, and we have a British document from 2002.
[01:47:45.998 --> 01:47:47.559]  The plan is three to four parts.
[01:47:47.939 --> 01:47:52.701]  Now, if you listen to NPR or watch PBS, they'll go, we've got a new plan.
[01:47:52.961 --> 01:47:54.482]  We'll break it in three to four parts.
[01:47:54.522 --> 01:47:55.482]  We're going to do the same thing.
[01:47:55.922 --> 01:47:57.623]  Oh, this guy wrote a document about it.
[01:47:57.663 --> 01:47:58.744]  Hey, this'll work.
[01:47:59.424 --> 01:48:00.864]  And so it was the plan all along.
[01:48:00.924 --> 01:48:01.805]  Charles, anything else?
[01:48:02.335 --> 01:48:02.715]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:03.075 --> 01:48:05.196]  When do you think they'll get these churches?
[01:48:05.256 --> 01:48:11.479]  I've been calling the churches asking them if, you know, Homeland Defense has gotten in touch with them in a way.
[01:48:11.519 --> 01:48:13.980]  They're telling me no, but I don't believe them.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.541]  But when do you think they're going to confiscate these guns?
[01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:18.022]  Well, it's FEMA.
[01:48:18.162 --> 01:48:20.003]  It's FEMA, 13,000 plus counties confirmed.
[01:48:20.263 --> 01:48:21.003]  That's official.
[01:48:21.383 --> 01:48:30.387]  Brainwashing the pastors to tell their practitioners that when the emergency comes, obey the government, turn in your guns, go to the emergency center, quarantine yourself.
[01:48:31.208 --> 01:48:31.748]  It'll come.
[01:48:32.412 --> 01:48:34.234]  Probably not after the next attack.
[01:48:34.254 --> 01:48:37.556]  They'll have another beta test, only take guns in a certain area.
[01:48:38.217 --> 01:48:43.521]  Then, down the road, you see each event gets bigger, each event is a laboratory in and of itself.
[01:48:44.382 --> 01:48:45.703]  And so that's when that'll happen, Charles.
[01:48:45.823 --> 01:48:50.207]  Mr. Jones, do you think the American people, do you think they'll try to
[01:48:51.035 --> 01:48:52.756]  They'll turn them in or they're going to give them up?
[01:48:53.036 --> 01:48:56.117]  Yeah, I think most people will turn their guns in.
[01:48:56.697 --> 01:49:03.779]  I think about 10% will refuse to the point of troops coming to their door, and I think about half of those will shoot back.
[01:49:04.419 --> 01:49:11.722]  And 5% of 100 plus million gun owners is over 5 million, and these armies will be completely wiped out.
[01:49:12.342 --> 01:49:13.242]  What do you think, Holland?
[01:49:14.122 --> 01:49:15.503]  Actually, I totally agree.
[01:49:17.609 --> 01:49:28.177]  We can see in fourth-generation warfare, which is what guerrilla warfare is evolving into, that stateless forces have a tremendous advantage over the slow-moving forces of an oppressive state.
[01:49:28.617 --> 01:49:32.700]  And if that would happen, I kind of feel sorry for the people who would take the gun down.
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:33.841]  I think it's going to be a slaughter.
[01:49:34.842 --> 01:49:36.523]  Hopefully, it never comes to that, though.
[01:49:36.783 --> 01:49:38.485]  Well, that's why they've got to do it in slow motion.
[01:49:38.545 --> 01:49:40.446]  I mean, everybody always goes, look at the military!
[01:49:40.466 --> 01:49:41.967]  They're so big, they'll tromp us!
[01:49:42.528 --> 01:49:42.848]  Folks!
[01:49:43.775 --> 01:49:47.196]  If 5 million of you have the will, nothing could stop us.
[01:49:47.256 --> 01:49:47.937]  You understand?
[01:49:48.097 --> 01:49:50.478]  We could take this country in 12 hours.
[01:49:50.858 --> 01:49:51.458]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.679 --> 01:49:58.001]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.201 --> 01:50:02.622]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.763 --> 01:50:07.144]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.184 --> 01:50:08.545]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.245 --> 01:50:10.046]  Panama.
[01:50:10.327 --> 01:50:14.551]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.611 --> 01:50:21.539]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.659 --> 01:50:23.682]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.042 --> 01:50:34.430]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:40.014]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.468 --> 01:50:57.371]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.591 --> 01:51:03.036]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.296 --> 01:51:13.684]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.844 --> 01:51:18.188]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria and cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.288 --> 01:51:19.149]  We're good to go!
[01:51:33.459 --> 01:51:37.943]  Yes, the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:47.670]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.927 --> 01:51:55.268]  I think so.
[01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:10.826]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.691 --> 01:52:42.794]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.954 --> 01:52:48.898]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:53.422 --> 01:53:06.993]  If the government tried a mass takeover, total gun confiscation, and called it that, it won't work.
[01:53:07.623 --> 01:53:10.848]  They'll call it new security parameters.
[01:53:11.509 --> 01:53:15.093]  ID cards will have five different levels of identification for citizens.
[01:53:15.374 --> 01:53:19.359]  You'll have the trusted citizens and the untrusted citizens in that gamut.
[01:53:20.801 --> 01:53:23.325]  And I keep calling it practitioners, it's parishioners.
[01:53:23.485 --> 01:53:24.066]  I know that.
[01:53:24.778 --> 01:53:27.301]  Sometimes I get a word in my head and use the wrong one.
[01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:32.406]  A practitioner is like a... he practices medicine or he practices something else.
[01:53:33.126 --> 01:53:38.171]  But it's parishioners that the pastors are brainwashing right now.
[01:53:38.592 --> 01:53:40.293]  But there is a stated plan.
[01:53:40.494 --> 01:53:42.075]  The military has been trained.
[01:53:42.095 --> 01:53:43.797]  FEMA has stated plans.
[01:53:43.877 --> 01:53:45.158]  It's PDD 25.
[01:53:45.719 --> 01:53:47.721]  I've interviewed emergency managers that have been briefed.
[01:53:47.801 --> 01:53:48.762]  I have some of the documents.
[01:53:49.564 --> 01:53:50.425]  To take our guns.
[01:53:50.485 --> 01:53:51.765]  That's part of the record now.
[01:53:51.845 --> 01:53:52.926]  You saw New Orleans.
[01:53:53.466 --> 01:53:54.667]  This is what the military does.
[01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:55.607]  They beta test.
[01:53:55.687 --> 01:53:59.789]  They take real life operations and they call that a warfare laboratory.
[01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:02.371]  And that's what happened in New Orleans.
[01:54:02.411 --> 01:54:04.292]  And they will do that nationwide.
[01:54:04.332 --> 01:54:06.273]  They want your guns.
[01:54:06.393 --> 01:54:10.775]  Believe me, guns are the only thing holding back total tyranny in this country.
[01:54:11.035 --> 01:54:15.778]  They take all your pension funds right now, folks, but they can't because they know there will be war on the streets.
[01:54:16.594 --> 01:54:17.655]  Very, very serious.
[01:54:17.875 --> 01:54:20.838]  Ron in Oklahoma, you're on the air with our guest, Holland.
[01:54:21.098 --> 01:54:21.838]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:54:22.339 --> 01:54:33.008]  Alex, it's becoming fairly common knowledge here in Oklahoma City that the FBI and the ATF blew up the Murrow building because of the mess they made at Waco.
[01:54:33.028 --> 01:54:36.290]  ATF was in the process of being disbanded.
[01:54:38.032 --> 01:54:40.494]  They had already started to draw down the office here in the city.
[01:54:41.277 --> 01:54:45.420]  Approximately a year before the bombing... Well, you say FBI, BATF.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.322]  They were certainly involved, but no, they had Arabs that were CIA that did it.
[01:54:49.803 --> 01:54:59.409]  Well, I'm not saying that they personally did it hands-on, but I know the bombing survivors, a group of the bombing survivors... Oh, believe me, sir, I've made two films about it.
[01:54:59.449 --> 01:55:06.734]  We've hired attorneys to try to sue the government, but at the last minute, the attorneys always back out.
[01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:10.210]  So the information is circulating here.
[01:55:10.290 --> 01:55:13.711]  Apparently someone is harassing their attorneys.
[01:55:15.731 --> 01:55:20.272]  So how many Oklahomans, let me ask Holland that, and let me ask you that respectively, Ron.
[01:55:20.792 --> 01:55:24.613]  What percentage of Oklahomans that you talk to know Oklahoma is a cover-up, Holland?
[01:55:26.133 --> 01:55:26.853]  What percentage?
[01:55:26.893 --> 01:55:28.214]  Well, it depends on how old they are.
[01:55:28.234 --> 01:55:33.815]  I mean, the young kids, the 18-year-old college kids, I mean, they're 8-year-olds.
[01:55:33.835 --> 01:55:35.195]  But people who are in Oklahoma City,
[01:55:36.041 --> 01:55:42.242]  Who were adults, I would say 80% know at least something was fishy about it.
[01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:48.064]  They may not go all the way, most of them won't because they cannot deal with that fact psychologically.
[01:55:48.604 --> 01:55:54.045]  But I would say 80% of the people in Oklahoma City know that something was fishy with that.
[01:55:54.065 --> 01:55:57.166]  I mean, the vast majority of people, even just bringing it up in conversation,
[01:55:57.771 --> 01:55:59.552]  They know that someone is lying.
[01:55:59.612 --> 01:56:06.014]  They know, they have a suspicion that John Doe number two was involved, that he wasn't some fictitious Where's Waldo character.
[01:56:06.034 --> 01:56:07.955]  Ron, give us your take.
[01:56:08.675 --> 01:56:11.816]  Alex, the attitude is shifting dramatically.
[01:56:12.016 --> 01:56:16.618]  At first, everybody said I was a lunatic because I said there was something wrong with the bombing.
[01:56:17.638 --> 01:56:19.239]  I called it the Reichstag bombing.
[01:56:20.159 --> 01:56:24.381]  We were constantly bombarded by propaganda 24 hours a day.
[01:56:24.461 --> 01:56:25.301]  They never shut up.
[01:56:25.925 --> 01:56:27.486]  Reminded me of Joseph Goebbels.
[01:56:27.546 --> 01:56:30.709]  I knew there was something wrong, along with the other things that I saw.
[01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:32.551]  Everybody said I was crazy.
[01:56:32.631 --> 01:56:33.712]  Oh, no, no, Doug.
[01:56:34.733 --> 01:56:36.554]  FBI did a thorough investigation.
[01:56:36.914 --> 01:56:38.316]  But now the mood is shifting.
[01:56:39.417 --> 01:56:45.041]  And people are becoming more aware, even though our media here is so controlled, Alex.
[01:56:45.782 --> 01:56:47.063]  We don't hear anything.
[01:56:47.444 --> 01:56:47.764]  I know.
[01:56:47.844 --> 01:56:48.705]  Oklahoma's bad.
[01:56:49.025 --> 01:56:49.685]  It's terrible.
[01:56:49.926 --> 01:56:51.347]  I mean, it is a black hole.
[01:56:52.302 --> 01:56:54.703]  And anyone who speaks out is harassed.
[01:56:55.063 --> 01:56:56.123]  You know, I told you that.
[01:56:56.643 --> 01:56:57.803]  Well, it's like Arkansas.
[01:56:57.823 --> 01:56:59.404]  You've got these old backwater states.
[01:56:59.464 --> 01:57:00.104]  Beautiful states.
[01:57:00.164 --> 01:57:00.964]  I love Oklahoma.
[01:57:01.324 --> 01:57:01.904]  Great people.
[01:57:01.964 --> 01:57:03.825]  I love Arkansas.
[01:57:03.845 --> 01:57:09.066]  But you've got good old-boy boss hogs that fit into the network quite nicely.
[01:57:09.566 --> 01:57:11.206]  Holland, I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:57:11.246 --> 01:57:13.647]  Folks can read your detailed article at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:13.687 --> 01:57:15.327]  And Ron, I want to thank you for the call.
[01:57:15.607 --> 01:57:17.408]  Holland, we'll be talking to you again in the future.
[01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:19.328]  And anything else you put together, please send it to us.
[01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:20.613]  Outstanding.
[01:57:20.673 --> 01:57:21.534]  I look forward to it, Alex.
[01:57:21.714 --> 01:57:22.034]  Thank you.
[01:57:22.054 --> 01:57:23.696]  You've done a really good job here.
[01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:26.559]  You've knocked a long home run here out of the park.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:27.420]  All right.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.765]  We'll come right back and take more calls and have another guest coming up.
[01:57:33.407 --> 01:57:38.292]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.575 --> 01:57:50.235]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.896 --> 01:57:51.957]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.657 --> 01:57:53.758]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.419 --> 01:57:55.240]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:56.881]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.901 --> 01:58:01.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.745 --> 01:58:05.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:11.514]  Gypsy Taube is joining us after this first break.
[01:58:12.762 --> 01:58:21.689]  She and others go around wherever members of the 9-11 Commission or their age are engaging in propaganda functions covering up the fact that 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:58:22.249 --> 01:58:25.212]  She blows a whistle, gets everybody's attention and lets them have it.
[01:58:25.712 --> 01:58:27.293]  We're going to play some of these audio clips.
[01:58:27.313 --> 01:58:29.315]  Some of them are really clear, some of them aren't.
[01:58:29.355 --> 01:58:30.436]  They try to drag her out.
[01:58:31.016 --> 01:58:38.578]  We'll also talk about this teacher who's being suspended for talking about 9-11 privately in the lunchroom with another teacher.
[01:58:39.338 --> 01:58:40.338]  It's all coming up.
[01:58:40.418 --> 01:58:42.199]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:58:42.299 --> 01:58:43.719]  Tom in Arkansas.
[01:58:44.119 --> 01:58:45.260]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:45.720]  Welcome.
[01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:47.320]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.541]  I have only two things to go over at the moment.
[01:58:50.761 --> 01:58:58.023]  I was directly involved in the setup for 9-11, and I sent you a packet of literature shortly thereafter.
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:04.464]  And I'd like to talk to you privately about that, but I just want to point out, I think things are accelerating.
[01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:07.307]  I'm feeling a tremendous amount of energy in the air.
[01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:12.330]  I went through my book collection last night and I found a book here called The Great Controversy.
[01:59:13.231 --> 01:59:18.475]  I would hope that your listeners are aware of that book because I think, among other points,
[01:59:20.458 --> 01:59:23.740]  The point is, I think they're hiding some really basic information.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:28.283]  Myth number one... Well, sir, I get sent thousands of pieces of information.
[01:59:28.323 --> 01:59:29.864]  We try to read it all, look at it all.
[01:59:29.984 --> 01:59:32.785]  I don't remember your info.
[01:59:32.825 --> 01:59:36.447]  Tell us, how were you involved in the pre-planning of 9-11?
[01:59:37.888 --> 01:59:41.631]  I am a photographer, and it all began when I visited with KBR.
[01:59:42.731 --> 01:59:47.334]  Shortly thereafter, I had an offer to photograph the headquarters for Star Wars.
[01:59:48.383 --> 01:59:52.945]  And then I went to New York City where I was involved photographing the World Trade Towers.
[01:59:52.965 --> 01:59:55.686]  Do you recall that information?
[01:59:55.746 --> 01:59:56.606]  No, I don't recall it.
[01:59:56.626 --> 01:59:57.127]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:57.367 --> 02:00:08.891]  Okay, I went to make a presentation confronting the evidence and I was bumped off the stage by Jimmy Walter because I was improperly dressed and I don't think he got the point.
[02:00:09.091 --> 02:00:11.733]  Okay, I don't know anything about all this, sir.
[02:00:12.273 --> 02:00:17.255]  So, the point is that in this event,
[02:00:18.524 --> 02:00:23.605]  of photographing the property, I was assigned to do what we called the Bridgeways Project.
[02:00:24.345 --> 02:00:29.926]  And the objective was to photograph not the buildings, but those buildings that surrounded the property.
[02:00:30.686 --> 02:00:41.248]  So from various advantage points, I was there photographing for a month and a half to cover facades of each additional property for whatever purposes I wasn't told.
[02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:45.309]  Essentially, the story evolved
[02:00:46.055 --> 02:00:48.956]  That the buildings eventually needed to come down.
[02:00:50.036 --> 02:01:04.501]  A project had been undertaken, Controlled Demolition, Inc., positively connected here, had delivered a package of assessment material on what it would take to demolish the buildings.
[02:01:05.201 --> 02:01:13.384]  And at that point on that day, in fact the day that the topping out of the steel on Building 7 was completed,
[02:01:14.076 --> 02:01:18.997]  They shut down the offices of the engineering office in World Trade Tower No.
[02:01:19.017 --> 02:01:32.460]  1, North Tower, and made all of us sign a waiver that we had nothing to do with the building, would never speak about the building, had no photos, plans, drawings, any related information concerning the building.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:33.520]  Goodbye.
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:42.602]  Now, I was the newest guy on the staff and really unknown by the people who were in this operation of shutting down the property.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:52.547]  And they didn't know me because I had never been in the building before, but obviously I'd been photographed or spotted, so they made me sign like everybody else.
[02:01:52.667 --> 02:01:56.250]  Now, a lot of the engineers had been there 10 and 15 years.
[02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:58.091]  You've got to understand... Okay, you know what?
[02:01:58.291 --> 02:02:00.072]  When did you send me this information?
[02:02:01.774 --> 02:02:02.654]  September 20th, 2001.
[02:02:05.296 --> 02:02:06.797]  Okay, can you send it again?
[02:02:07.157 --> 02:02:07.718]  You betcha!
[02:02:08.178 --> 02:02:09.479]  Okay, thanks for the call, sir.
[02:02:09.779 --> 02:02:10.560]  I appreciate it.
[02:02:11.498 --> 02:02:13.480]  Certainly there was a lot of pre-planning for what they did.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:14.981]  I can't confirm what you're saying.
[02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:17.743]  Send it to me again and I'll pay attention to it.
[02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:21.406]  I don't know how I missed that, but who knows, maybe it didn't get to me.
[02:02:22.687 --> 02:02:25.309]  Alright, Gypsy will be joining us after this quick break.
[02:02:26.098 --> 02:02:28.581]  Some riveting audio clips, several different issues.
[02:02:28.601 --> 02:02:30.964]  We're talking about 9-11 activism.
[02:02:30.984 --> 02:02:34.148]  And this goes for activism on any issue.
[02:02:34.308 --> 02:02:41.617]  Property rights, Second Amendment, border, any issue that you're involved in, this lady is a real champion.
[02:02:41.997 --> 02:02:42.678]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.437 --> 02:02:49.278]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.558 --> 02:02:51.119]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.479 --> 02:02:56.402]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.482 --> 02:03:00.904]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology for philosophy.
[02:03:01.324 --> 02:03:05.526]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.746 --> 02:03:07.006]  The Constitution has been shredded.
[02:03:07.166 --> 02:03:08.487]  America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.667 --> 02:03:13.329]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.529 --> 02:03:17.890]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:25.412]  Plunge the depths of your elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.653 --> 02:03:28.073]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.233 --> 02:03:29.974]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.450 --> 02:03:48.932]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.192 --> 02:03:52.713]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.793 --> 02:03:56.735]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.955 --> 02:04:03.117]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.518 --> 02:04:11.421]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.841 --> 02:04:17.185]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.345 --> 02:04:21.107]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.488 --> 02:04:23.329]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:25.551]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.811 --> 02:04:30.754]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.794 --> 02:04:36.338]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:41.369]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:50.464]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[02:04:50.864 --> 02:04:53.546]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:53.706 --> 02:04:58.309]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[02:04:58.469 --> 02:05:03.293]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[02:05:03.473 --> 02:05:08.216]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[02:05:08.436 --> 02:05:11.118]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:11.338 --> 02:05:14.240]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:16.521]  Looking for profits?
[02:05:16.601 --> 02:05:17.981]  Looking for safety and security?
[02:05:18.422 --> 02:05:21.523]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:05:21.563 --> 02:05:29.126]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[02:05:29.206 --> 02:05:32.707]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:05:32.947 --> 02:05:34.488]  Secure your position today.
[02:05:34.768 --> 02:05:35.988]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:36.048 --> 02:05:36.268]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:46.301 --> 02:05:48.383]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.943 --> 02:05:51.825]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.229 --> 02:06:14.860]  All told, I've got a nine-minute clip of Gypsy Tab, who is an American who, of course, was born in Moscow, and she exhibits more what we'd think of as, you know, classical American attributes than the average
[02:06:15.615 --> 02:06:20.579]  Fat, dumb, and happy person out there that watches TV 24 hours a day.
[02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:27.305]  And Gypsy, these videos are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:06:27.885 --> 02:06:38.133]  And she confronts Zelikow, the head staffer for the 9-11 Commission, who was, from all the evidence shows, clearly involved in some of the operations of 9-11.
[02:06:39.548 --> 02:06:46.054]  To see it when she blows the whistle, the face he makes, and then she confronts him with 9-11 evidence of an inside job.
[02:06:47.075 --> 02:06:51.378]  He gets very, very upset and they drag her off and she confronts many other people.
[02:06:52.019 --> 02:06:58.264]  So what we'll do is we'll play clips and then after we play the clips she'll tell you who it was that she was confronting.
[02:06:58.284 --> 02:06:59.986]  That's the best way to do it.
[02:07:01.147 --> 02:07:03.369]  Now I have a clip of a high school substitute teacher.
[02:07:04.033 --> 02:07:12.197]  Who simply talked about 9-11 being an inside job in the lunchroom with other teachers, and they're all demanding he be expelled, that he be suspended.
[02:07:13.217 --> 02:07:15.958]  Well, he is suspended now because you just can't talk like this.
[02:07:16.739 --> 02:07:20.700]  We are the new Soviet Union and he needs to basically go to a work camp.
[02:07:22.401 --> 02:07:24.942]  Gypsy Tom, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:07:24.962 --> 02:07:29.164]  You've got a lot of courage and we can all take examples from what you did.
[02:07:29.184 --> 02:07:30.645]  Thank you.
[02:07:31.457 --> 02:07:36.722]  Gypsy, tell us a little bit about yourself and why you decided to start physically confronting these monsters.
[02:07:38.304 --> 02:07:47.333]  Well, I'm from Russia and I left there in 1986 and I was basically raised in an environment of fear.
[02:07:48.294 --> 02:07:50.356]  You know, things were just like every day.
[02:07:50.716 --> 02:07:53.739]  Everybody went to school and to work and there were good things and bad things.
[02:07:56.241 --> 02:08:01.023]  It didn't look all that horrible on the surface, but at the same time you couldn't tell a joke.
[02:08:01.043 --> 02:08:03.884]  You couldn't express a different opinion in your history class.
[02:08:04.405 --> 02:08:10.708]  I was kicked out of school because I wasn't as pro-government as they wanted me to be in my history classes.
[02:08:12.969 --> 02:08:17.311]  I basically told my teacher that I'm not going to go to her classes because it's nothing but propaganda.
[02:08:17.771 --> 02:08:20.293]  Gypsy, can you back off your phone just a little bit?
[02:08:20.313 --> 02:08:20.573]  Thanks.
[02:08:24.056 --> 02:08:46.400]  Anyways, I was raised in this environment of fear, and I came to the States thinking it was going to be free, and I realized it wasn't as free as I was hoping, and now things are going in a very bad direction, and I recognize all the same signs of all the same stuff that I was raised with, and I'm just, this time I'm not going to leave the country like I did in Russia.
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:49.541]  This time I'm going to, you know, fix the problem.
[02:08:49.561 --> 02:08:50.581]  That's my goal.
[02:08:52.118 --> 02:08:54.860]  Well, Gypsy, there's nothing more patriotic.
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:59.143]  I wish, you know, Americans have had it so good, they don't know what they're losing.
[02:08:59.584 --> 02:09:09.011]  But I talk to people from the Eastern Bloc, from China, from Cuba, they know, they say, man, I've seen this before, this is bad.
[02:09:09.831 --> 02:09:10.692]  Right, exactly.
[02:09:11.072 --> 02:09:16.456]  And people here think that just because they wake up and the sun is shining in the morning and they go to work and
[02:09:16.994 --> 02:09:19.575]  You know, they sleep with their wife and all that kind of stuff.
[02:09:19.595 --> 02:09:21.255]  They think it's not going to happen here.
[02:09:21.435 --> 02:09:28.577]  And they imagine Russia or Nazi Germany to be some dark, black and white place with concentration camps all over the place.
[02:09:28.937 --> 02:09:29.977]  It's not how it was.
[02:09:30.037 --> 02:09:37.139]  You know, you would never know by going out on the street that there was something wrong, except there were big slogans, you know, all over the place.
[02:09:37.159 --> 02:09:39.639]  But other than that, you know, life was as usual.
[02:09:39.799 --> 02:09:41.320]  And it seemed to be as usual.
[02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:43.040]  And it was like a normal place.
[02:09:43.479 --> 02:09:57.450]  Yet all of these things happened, and like most of my family from my grandparents' side, more than half the family was literally executed, was in exile, and was destroyed completely.
[02:09:57.930 --> 02:10:01.013]  That's what happened to my grandparents' families.
[02:10:01.973 --> 02:10:03.775]  So there was a lot of fear.
[02:10:03.815 --> 02:10:07.438]  People were afraid to do anything because this is what happened to their parents.
[02:10:08.177 --> 02:10:09.558]  And that's a good place to start.
[02:10:09.618 --> 02:10:31.656]  Before we play the clips of you valiantly confronting these scumbags, let's play this local news clip where a well-accredited, by the way, school teacher, listen to his credentials, simply talked quietly at a lunch table and they don't think that he should be allowed to do this, so he's been suspended and they're talking about him never getting his job back.
[02:10:31.936 --> 02:10:32.957]  Go ahead and roll this clip.
[02:10:36.397 --> 02:10:43.040]  Live from the NBC 4 studios, this is NBC 4 at 11, working for you.
[02:10:44.501 --> 02:10:50.463]  The First Amendment right to free speech may be at the center of a debate as a substitute teacher fights for his job.
[02:10:50.683 --> 02:10:55.345]  He told another teacher this week the United States may be partly responsible for September 11th.
[02:10:55.465 --> 02:10:59.007]  That remark could end his career as a sub in Columbus.
[02:10:59.067 --> 02:11:00.908]  David Wayne has the story only on 4.
[02:11:02.248 --> 02:11:08.670]  Thomas Mustrick describes himself as a political anthropologist promoting peace when meeting with dignitaries in international locations.
[02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:11.811]  For two years, he's been a sub for Columbus Public Schools.
[02:11:12.151 --> 02:11:14.892]  But his remarks at Griggs High Monday could end that career.
[02:11:15.212 --> 02:11:19.093]  In a letter to the district, the principal details Mustrick's conversation with another teacher.
[02:11:19.514 --> 02:11:23.355]  He had told her that 9-11 was planned and orchestrated by the United States government.
[02:11:23.755 --> 02:11:25.135]  Mustrick says that's his right.
[02:11:25.355 --> 02:11:28.336]  Number one, I don't discuss any of these kinds of things in our classroom.
[02:11:28.416 --> 02:11:29.417]  I stay right with the topics.
[02:11:29.477 --> 02:11:30.497]  I do what I need to be doing.
[02:11:31.218 --> 02:11:39.944]  And it's inappropriate to challenge somebody on a constitutional grounds when it's just a private conversation.
[02:11:40.244 --> 02:11:46.648]  The teacher wrote her own account saying Mustrick also talked about getting regular phone calls from an unnamed person using a code name.
[02:11:46.948 --> 02:11:54.513]  She goes on to say, if these ideas are delusions, I believe that Mr. Mustrick should not teach in schools where students would gullibly believe his statements.
[02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:56.814]  It could be an uphill battle for Mustrick.
[02:11:57.114 --> 02:12:00.796]  As a substitute, he doesn't have union representation or a contract.
[02:12:01.076 --> 02:12:04.618]  The district says schools have the right to use or not use any substitute.
[02:12:04.738 --> 02:12:06.239]  Mustrick remains optimistic.
[02:12:06.479 --> 02:12:07.519]  It'll all work out in the end.
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:09.520]  You know, generally the truth will prevail.
[02:12:09.941 --> 02:12:12.962]  A teacher on the learning curve of what's acceptable and what's not.
[02:12:13.022 --> 02:12:14.383]  David Wayne, NBC4.
[02:12:15.383 --> 02:12:20.266]  The teacher plans to fight for his substitute job during a hearing this coming Monday at district headquarters.
[02:12:21.215 --> 02:12:23.096]  And we're going to be getting Mr. Mustrick on.
[02:12:23.496 --> 02:12:25.357]  Comments, Ms.
[02:12:25.377 --> 02:12:25.737]  Talb?
[02:12:27.057 --> 02:12:28.798]  Well, this sounds a lot like home.
[02:12:30.619 --> 02:12:32.420]  Except things were even worse.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.602]  I would say that teacher would have been long since expelled from school in my country.
[02:12:37.662 --> 02:12:43.404]  And even a student, you know, you couldn't tell a joke on the phone, for instance, because the phones were bugged.
[02:12:44.241 --> 02:12:51.145]  Telling jokes, you know, my parents told us stuff but we weren't allowed to talk about it to anybody else because there'd be big trouble.
[02:12:51.685 --> 02:12:56.588]  So this is headed in that direction and I feel that it's even more dangerous because the U.S.
[02:12:56.628 --> 02:13:11.916]  has a lot more, a much better developed military-industrial complex and the computers are by far more sophisticated than what we had in Russia so the spying on citizens and all that is a lot worse here, can be a lot worse.
[02:13:12.719 --> 02:13:17.820]  Now, tell us when you decided to... Carol Bruguier also was in one of these clips.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:18.660]  Great lady.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:20.421]  I've been involved for years exposing 9-11.
[02:13:20.801 --> 02:13:23.241]  When did you decide to start going to these meetings?
[02:13:23.521 --> 02:13:25.362]  Tell us about some of these clips we're going to be hearing.
[02:13:26.842 --> 02:13:31.883]  Well, I was living in Hawaii before 9-11 and I decided to move to San Francisco to become an activist.
[02:13:32.303 --> 02:13:34.984]  And then, this was before it even happened.
[02:13:35.564 --> 02:13:38.964]  And then I moved to San Francisco and I got involved in the anti-war movement.
[02:13:39.064 --> 02:13:41.805]  And I knew that 9-11 was an inside job right away.
[02:13:42.372 --> 02:13:47.254]  And I was looking for information, and I met Carol at an anti-war rally.
[02:13:47.294 --> 02:13:52.336]  She was tabling, and I bought a book called War on Freedom by Nafiz Ahmed.
[02:13:52.856 --> 02:13:56.817]  And, you know, that's how I hooked up with Carol, kind of became an activist slowly.
[02:13:57.077 --> 02:14:00.018]  You know, now I have public access shows.
[02:14:00.078 --> 02:14:01.579]  I have, how many?
[02:14:01.619 --> 02:14:06.621]  Six public access shows right now here in the Bay Area, and, you know, I have weekly events.
[02:14:07.991 --> 02:14:13.258]  I just put on a big event for loose change, the Grand Lake Theater, so I'm doing as much as I can with three children.
[02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:17.423]  I'm kind of restricted time-wise, but I've been involved.
[02:14:17.483 --> 02:14:21.789]  I was involved for a while before I blew the whistle, but it sounded like a great idea.
[02:14:21.869 --> 02:14:25.053]  Carol told me that some woman on the East Coast had this idea of the whistle.
[02:14:25.899 --> 02:14:27.160]  And I just loved it.
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:29.721]  It was just something I would have loved to do.
[02:14:29.821 --> 02:14:30.522]  So I did it.
[02:14:30.822 --> 02:14:33.823]  Now we haven't been able to confer with you which clip will play first.
[02:14:33.883 --> 02:14:35.164]  I just uploaded them to the network.
[02:14:35.184 --> 02:14:38.206]  So we're going to play each of these six clips and let you comment on each one.
[02:14:38.626 --> 02:14:40.087]  Let's go ahead and roll one of these now.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.182]  Everyone was an inside job.
[02:14:45.242 --> 02:14:46.764]  Shame on the cover of commissions.
[02:14:46.784 --> 02:14:51.009]  90% of the questions asked by the scientists were never answered.
[02:14:51.489 --> 02:14:52.130]  Or even asked.
[02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:53.812]  What happened to Building 7?
[02:14:53.872 --> 02:14:58.157]  Why did it collapse in 7 seconds in the matter of controlled demolition?
[02:14:58.598 --> 02:15:02.182]  How come the firefighters were reporting explosions in the Twin Towers?
[02:15:03.303 --> 02:15:10.565]  How come the debris from the Twin Towers was hauled off and sold to other countries for cheap before the investigation had a chance to take place?
[02:15:11.145 --> 02:15:17.407]  Who benefited from the foot option on the United and American Airlines and how come that was never investigated?
[02:15:18.027 --> 02:15:21.948]  How come Ron's still defending his duties during the attacks?
[02:15:23.752 --> 02:15:30.434]  Why did Bush continue reading a ghost story for 20 minutes after he was informed that Alex was dead?
[02:15:30.494 --> 02:15:34.655]  What happened to the eight black ruffles on the plane?
[02:15:35.495 --> 02:15:37.856]  The flight 93 was never shut down?
[02:15:38.176 --> 02:15:40.716]  Why was the debris trashed over 9 miles?
[02:15:41.337 --> 02:15:45.358]  What was the 99 behind 9-11 doing visiting Tokyo as official?
[02:15:47.338 --> 02:15:48.779]  And they drag her out.
[02:15:48.979 --> 02:15:51.259]  Tell folks about that particular clip.
[02:15:51.399 --> 02:15:55.081]  And it's very important that they know that we know, but go ahead.
[02:16:16.636 --> 02:16:17.217]  Right, right.
[02:16:18.037 --> 02:16:20.519]  The head of the police was sitting right next to me.
[02:16:20.539 --> 02:16:24.822]  I was hoping there wouldn't be any cops there, but she was right at the next table.
[02:16:25.403 --> 02:16:28.005]  She didn't do anything, though, to stop me.
[02:16:28.525 --> 02:16:37.472]  They just... Well, it was Ben Venista that I confronted, and... A member of the 9-11 Commission.
[02:16:37.772 --> 02:16:43.216]  Yes, it was a member of the Keene Commission, and, you know, we know that the Keene Commission is a big cover-up, and...
[02:16:43.877 --> 02:16:55.726]  You know, I was present at the Mike Rupert's presentation at the Commonwealth Club, where he talks about the biographies of these people, and it's nothing but conflicts of interest and criminal background.
[02:16:55.786 --> 02:16:56.427]  It's awful.
[02:16:56.487 --> 02:16:58.428]  So they're all totally awful.
[02:16:59.149 --> 02:17:01.451]  So I confronted him asking all these questions.
[02:17:01.651 --> 02:17:03.532]  We were never allowed to ask questions.
[02:17:03.612 --> 02:17:09.377]  They would always be censored out, and we were just allowed to give questions on a piece of paper, and then they would just never read them.
[02:17:09.833 --> 02:17:11.596]  So I stood up and asked all these questions.
[02:17:11.897 --> 02:17:12.338]  That's right.
[02:17:12.398 --> 02:17:15.583]  Later they always say in these clips, you have been allowed to ask questions.
[02:17:15.904 --> 02:17:16.866]  We took questions.
[02:17:17.186 --> 02:17:17.587]  No, no, no.
[02:17:17.607 --> 02:17:19.170]  It's pieces of paper passed forward.
[02:17:19.630 --> 02:17:20.232]  Stay there.
[02:17:20.292 --> 02:17:22.536]  We'll come back and play five more clips.
[02:17:23.519 --> 02:17:24.439]  And they get even better.
[02:17:24.739 --> 02:17:26.680]  I wish you could see the Zelikow video.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.681]  For folks that have computers, go to mpolewars.com.
[02:17:30.201 --> 02:17:31.241]  It's posted up there.
[02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:33.642]  He looks like he got run over by a Mack truck.
[02:17:34.202 --> 02:17:39.584]  He looks as guilty as a cat caught with a canary in his mouth.
[02:17:40.044 --> 02:17:42.945]  You know when Sylvester gets caught trying to eat Tweety Bird?
[02:17:43.265 --> 02:17:44.305]  That's the look on his face.
[02:17:45.655 --> 02:17:47.276]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:47.396 --> 02:17:51.539]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:51.639 --> 02:17:54.521]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:54.601 --> 02:18:01.326]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:04.508]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:04.708 --> 02:18:07.090]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:11.953]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:18:12.273 --> 02:18:12.893]  I don't know.
[02:18:36.943 --> 02:18:51.571]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[02:18:52.331 --> 02:18:55.993]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[02:18:56.734 --> 02:18:58.215]  It includes the history of U.S.
[02:18:58.295 --> 02:19:02.377]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards,
[02:19:02.987 --> 02:19:04.649]  Learn the stability of real money.
[02:19:05.069 --> 02:19:07.131]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[02:19:07.531 --> 02:19:09.073]  They are instruments of debt.
[02:19:09.313 --> 02:19:11.395]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[02:19:46.537 --> 02:19:48.999]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.099 --> 02:19:54.344]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[02:19:54.404 --> 02:20:01.110]  The book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:02.451]  We're good to go.
[02:20:17.125 --> 02:20:17.305]  516-8736.

[02:20:45.430 --> 02:20:53.956]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[02:20:54.176 --> 02:20:57.399]  It affects about 50 million Americans, that's 1 in 4 adults.
[02:20:57.719 --> 02:21:03.823]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[02:21:51.673 --> 02:21:54.433]  Gypsy Child is our guest.
[02:21:54.533 --> 02:21:55.473]  Grew up in Russia.
[02:21:55.894 --> 02:21:58.554]  Knows a police state when she sees it.
[02:22:00.215 --> 02:22:06.836]  The creeping intimidation, the control, the free speech zones, all of it.
[02:22:08.897 --> 02:22:14.618]  And there's clip after clip of her and others blowing the whistle and then confronting
[02:22:15.296 --> 02:22:23.219]  These different commission members and other members that supported it, like Zelikow, who was really the head of the commission, but he was the quote, head staffer.
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:25.981]  Let's go ahead and play the next clip.
[02:22:27.641 --> 02:22:33.364]  In penetrating our civil aviation security system, they went 19 for 19.
[02:22:33.424 --> 02:22:37.605]  That's not the product of luck or good fortune.
[02:22:38.086 --> 02:22:39.726]  That's the product of planning and training.
[02:22:40.947 --> 02:22:43.508]  They had practiced boarding aircraft,
[02:22:45.169 --> 02:22:46.934]  That's funny, I was waiting for you to go.
[02:22:49.718 --> 02:22:52.559]  Light on!
[02:22:52.599 --> 02:22:53.760]  Light on!
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:55.521]  Light on!
[02:22:55.661 --> 02:22:56.781]  Light on!
[02:22:56.841 --> 02:22:58.142]  Light on!
[02:22:58.522 --> 02:22:59.482]  Light on!
[02:22:59.582 --> 02:23:00.683]  Light on!
[02:23:19.831 --> 02:23:23.885]  Zelikow... Zelikow is panicking right here.
[02:23:24.547 --> 02:23:25.250]  Keep rolling it.
[02:23:27.402 --> 02:23:31.545]  You are disrupting this meeting and you are required to leave.
[02:23:32.325 --> 02:23:37.149]  And anyone else who seeks to disrupt this meeting will be escorted from it.
[02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:38.229]  Thank you very much.
[02:23:40.651 --> 02:23:42.472]  I will repeat myself again.
[02:23:42.712 --> 02:23:45.895]  Anyone else who seeks to disrupt this meeting will leave.
[02:23:45.935 --> 02:23:47.636]  Is that understood?
[02:23:50.958 --> 02:23:51.599]  Yes you can.
[02:23:52.878 --> 02:24:02.161]  How about, how about the bodies of the heads of the murderers, the different morphs of the bodies, from the bodies of, uh, Sash and the White Man, Sash?
[02:24:02.701 --> 02:24:10.024]  These chains conducted war game exercises on September 11th that involved fake blinks and simulated hijackings.
[02:24:10.044 --> 02:24:12.125]  We will follow the same procedures.
[02:24:12.145 --> 02:24:13.725]  If it happens again.
[02:24:13.965 --> 02:24:15.406]  Yes, if it happens again.
[02:24:15.786 --> 02:24:19.367]  You are the biggest terrorist on this planet, you and your CIA buddies.
[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:26.462]  And Zelichow is totally shaken.
[02:24:26.522 --> 02:24:30.545]  One of my members of staff here said he didn't look like a cat that grabbed the canary.
[02:24:31.026 --> 02:24:34.528]  He looked like somebody who'd done something in their pants, but I'm not going to go that far.
[02:24:35.789 --> 02:24:49.800]  Now, in other cases, these special forces looking type guys come get on both sides of her, and this is what professionals do, and they start talking right in both your ears, real loud, trying to stop you from being able to talk so they can drag you out.
[02:24:50.971 --> 02:24:52.691]  Didn't work with this lady.
[02:24:52.752 --> 02:24:57.213]  I only wish that the folks videotaping her would give her a handheld mic or a wireless.
[02:24:57.233 --> 02:24:59.133]  That way we could hear all of her crisp audio.
[02:24:59.173 --> 02:25:06.275]  But tell us, Gypsy, about the particular confrontation with Zelikow.
[02:25:06.735 --> 02:25:09.536]  And for those that don't know who Zelikow is, tell us.
[02:25:11.036 --> 02:25:17.738]  Well, Zelikow is, you know, according to my group, that's where I heard mostly about Zelikow.
[02:25:18.451 --> 02:25:23.833]  Um, you know, he's basically the head of the commission, and he was asked to resign because of his conflicts of interest.
[02:25:23.873 --> 02:25:29.935]  He had co-authored a book with Condoleezza Rice, and he's really tight with the White House, so he should have never been on there.
[02:25:30.775 --> 02:25:38.437]  Um, you know, so he... I confronted him just because I confronted everybody who came to the Bay Area.
[02:25:39.257 --> 02:25:46.259]  And, um, he was really, um, if anybody was really mad, he was the maddest one of all of them.
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:47.860]  And, um,
[02:25:48.863 --> 02:25:54.146]  Um, so as far as the police at, um, it was actually kind of interesting.
[02:25:54.186 --> 02:26:02.870]  The police that were there, they were, um, dressed in regular clothes, and they escorted me out, and then they escorted Carol out, and that older policeman that was there.
[02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:11.294]  He begged us to not go inside anymore, because he was supposed to arrest Carol, and he said he had to arrest the next person that went in, and he just let us go.
[02:26:11.834 --> 02:26:15.376]  And, um, he actually thanked us for expressing ourselves, believe it or not.
[02:26:16.505 --> 02:26:18.946]  Um, you know, may believe the same kind of things we believe.
[02:26:20.007 --> 02:26:25.970]  Um, and then with, um, the last clip was, um, or should we talk about that after the clip?
[02:26:27.751 --> 02:26:31.073]  Go ahead and tell us about the clip that's coming up and we'll play it when we get back.
[02:26:31.373 --> 02:26:45.861]  Yeah, um, the Jamie Gorilla clip, um, it was kind of interesting because, um, you know, I really wanted to do it and, um, my babysitter didn't, uh, totally flaked on me because I guess she was afraid of what I was going to do and, um,
[02:26:46.357 --> 02:26:47.878]  I brought my little children.
[02:26:47.918 --> 02:26:50.380]  They were like 2 and 4 years old.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:55.543]  Carol was outside and I asked her to babysit them for me while I blew the whistle.
[02:26:55.583 --> 02:26:57.665]  I didn't know if I was going to be arrested or not.
[02:26:57.685 --> 02:27:01.607]  I asked her to take them a couple blocks away so they wouldn't see it if I get dragged out.
[02:27:01.988 --> 02:27:03.769]  They wouldn't be traumatized by watching that.
[02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:06.831]  I had to take care of them until I got out of jail.
[02:27:07.431 --> 02:27:09.392]  So she did and she took them.
[02:27:09.432 --> 02:27:10.433]  I went upstairs.
[02:27:10.693 --> 02:27:12.675]  I was pregnant with my third child.
[02:27:13.335 --> 02:27:14.476]  I blew the whistle.
[02:27:14.536 --> 02:27:15.356]  It was really fun.
[02:27:16.673 --> 02:27:20.194]  It was a smaller crowd there, but it was still really fun to do.
[02:27:20.334 --> 02:27:22.934]  Well, I want you to know, I'm going to start blowing the whistle.
[02:27:23.535 --> 02:27:24.055]  I like it.
[02:27:24.095 --> 02:27:25.855]  It's a way to get everybody's attention.
[02:27:26.795 --> 02:27:29.996]  We'll be right back after this quick break with our guests.
[02:27:30.016 --> 02:27:32.097]  We'll also take some calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:32.117 --> 02:27:32.817]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.917 --> 02:27:33.757]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:33.797 --> 02:27:35.937]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.752 --> 02:27:47.593]  Come on, Bill.
[02:27:47.813 --> 02:27:52.976]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:27:53.316 --> 02:27:54.817]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:27:54.917 --> 02:27:56.898]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:27:57.158 --> 02:28:02.681]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:02.981 --> 02:28:09.225]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:28:09.565 --> 02:28:11.746]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:28:12.026 --> 02:28:15.470]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[02:28:15.711 --> 02:28:16.131]  Whoa!
[02:28:16.512 --> 02:28:17.713]  What was that website again?
[02:28:17.793 --> 02:28:21.278]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:21.598 --> 02:28:22.699]  Now write this down, John.
[02:28:22.839 --> 02:28:27.145]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:28:27.305 --> 02:28:27.886]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:28:28.146 --> 02:28:29.347]  I'm going there right now.
[02:28:29.768 --> 02:28:30.409]  Check, please!
[02:28:32.173 --> 02:28:33.616]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:28:34.097 --> 02:28:34.698]  Sure, John.
[02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:39.328]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:39.609 --> 02:28:41.293]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:28:41.473 --> 02:28:41.734]  Deal?
[02:28:43.348 --> 02:28:44.989]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:45.109 --> 02:28:49.230]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:49.350 --> 02:28:52.231]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:52.311 --> 02:28:59.034]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:28:59.214 --> 02:29:02.215]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:02.415 --> 02:29:04.796]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:04.936 --> 02:29:09.658]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:09.838 --> 02:29:24.405]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptozene, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:24.565 --> 02:29:31.268]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:35.010]  That's 808-803-4438.
[02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.271]  That's 808-803-4438.
[02:29:35.331 --> 02:29:36.653]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:49.393]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:49.754 --> 02:29:54.436]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[02:29:54.776 --> 02:30:02.420]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:09.564]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:09.784 --> 02:30:11.165]  There are no side effects!
[02:30:11.505 --> 02:30:15.126]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:22.448]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:30:38.815 --> 02:30:41.217]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:46.942 --> 02:30:52.086]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.767 --> 02:30:55.169]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:55.189 --> 02:30:59.172]  Couple months ago, I dropped the ball big time.
[02:30:59.192 --> 02:31:00.573]  See?
[02:31:09.127 --> 02:31:11.287]  We're good to go.
[02:31:52.739 --> 02:31:52.879]  Ah!
[02:31:53.299 --> 02:31:54.139]  We're back live.
[02:31:54.179 --> 02:31:55.340]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:56.480]  The network's up in Minnesota.
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:59.280]  Lately, we've had connection problems.
[02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:01.161]  I was about to reconnect during the break.
[02:32:01.721 --> 02:32:03.881]  We ran out of time and I said, this thing's getting bad.
[02:32:04.321 --> 02:32:08.222]  You can't hear it, but I was hearing it getting choppy and sure enough it cut out.
[02:32:08.282 --> 02:32:12.723]  Finishing up what I was saying, a few months ago, I dropped the ball big time.
[02:32:12.763 --> 02:32:17.064]  I'd just gotten back from LA on a project out there that we're working on secretly.
[02:32:18.044 --> 02:32:19.765]  And I had been on the air in two days.
[02:32:19.785 --> 02:32:21.165]  I needed to do a live show.
[02:32:22.037 --> 02:32:35.404]  Chairman Keene was coming to Round Rock, Texas, or Georgetown to be specific, up there at the University, and I knew Bob Dacey and Kevin Smith and others were going to go, and they weren't polite.
[02:32:35.504 --> 02:32:37.865]  Bob Dacey was, oh, thank you, sir, for your answers and things.
[02:32:38.525 --> 02:32:39.186]  I wouldn't have done it.
[02:32:39.246 --> 02:32:40.986]  They did bring up Building 7 being imploded.
[02:32:41.006 --> 02:32:45.829]  They did bring up how there was funding by General Mahmoud Ahmed
[02:32:46.864 --> 02:32:48.125]  To the supposed hijackers.
[02:32:48.165 --> 02:32:50.406]  And of course, Keem was very smug and very disgusting.
[02:32:50.867 --> 02:32:51.927]  I couldn't have controlled myself.
[02:32:51.967 --> 02:32:55.009]  I would have called him an accomplice to murder after the fact right there.
[02:32:55.089 --> 02:32:57.550]  I mean, those commissioners took secret testimony.
[02:32:57.591 --> 02:32:58.711]  They knew what really went on.
[02:32:59.091 --> 02:33:00.592]  Their job was to cover up and lie.
[02:33:00.612 --> 02:33:02.133]  Their whole report's a fraud.
[02:33:02.553 --> 02:33:03.594]  And I should have gone to that.
[02:33:04.555 --> 02:33:05.295]  I should have gone to that.
[02:33:05.335 --> 02:33:07.757]  But we did post the video of the questions we did ask.
[02:33:08.337 --> 02:33:13.480]  And people did confront him and yell at him when he was up on the dais giving a speech and said it was an inside job.
[02:33:14.695 --> 02:33:19.773]  And then the police wouldn't let my people have a 9-11 as an inside job banner.
[02:33:20.683 --> 02:33:21.724]  Anywhere around the university.
[02:33:21.764 --> 02:33:28.090]  They made them go to soccer fields, baseball fields, hundreds and hundreds of yards away where no one could see them.
[02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:29.371]  That's the freedom in America.
[02:33:29.771 --> 02:33:30.912]  The cops laughed at them.
[02:33:30.932 --> 02:33:32.574]  They said, Oh, free speech zones over there!
[02:33:32.654 --> 02:33:33.575]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:33:34.315 --> 02:33:35.997]  Killing America is so much fun!
[02:33:36.237 --> 02:33:37.298]  Killing the First Amendment!
[02:33:37.779 --> 02:33:42.603]  Going back to a lady who didn't back down and who does bring out the real evidence.
[02:33:42.943 --> 02:33:46.026]  Before we play this final clip that we have time for here and take some calls,
[02:33:48.136 --> 02:33:58.440]  Mrs. Taub, why don't you go over some of the things that you were raising to them, or if you had five minutes, to really get in their face and confront them, what some of the smoking guns are that you would cover?
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:09.463]  Well, I would say, from all the footage that I've seen and, you know, showing it to people, I think the most convincing is Building 7.
[02:34:09.723 --> 02:34:14.325]  When people look at it, you just watch it fall and all you have to do is use your own eyes.
[02:34:14.345 --> 02:34:17.046]  You don't have to rely on anybody else's information.
[02:34:18.364 --> 02:34:19.965]  You just see it, and it's right there.
[02:34:20.005 --> 02:34:26.070]  You can see that it's definitely not being destroyed by fire, and the way it's falling down is obviously controlled demolition.
[02:34:27.310 --> 02:34:42.821]  With the Pentagon, I think it's also very obvious that if you look at the pictures before the facade of the Pentagon collapses, it's a perfectly round tiny hole, and there is no plane anywhere in that picture or any other pictures, and going through all those layers of
[02:34:43.533 --> 02:34:44.553]  Reinforced concrete.
[02:34:44.793 --> 02:34:52.196]  A plane couldn't have done it, and as they say, if it evaporated, as some people claim, then how could it have gone through so much concrete?
[02:34:53.376 --> 02:34:58.698]  I think it's very incriminating that we were never shown the videos of the plane hitting the Pentagon.
[02:34:58.898 --> 02:35:01.839]  We were shown the towers being hit, God knows how many times.
[02:35:02.339 --> 02:35:05.460]  How come we don't have such nice video of the Pentagon?
[02:35:06.061 --> 02:35:10.022]  I will never believe that there weren't any security cameras on the Pentagon.
[02:35:10.595 --> 02:35:14.658]  You have security cameras everywhere nowadays, so don't tell me that you don't have footage.
[02:35:15.479 --> 02:35:22.845]  And that they released in the newspapers a few days ago just shows a trail of smoke.
[02:35:22.865 --> 02:35:24.206]  There is no plane in there.
[02:35:24.266 --> 02:35:26.228]  There's not anything resembling a plane.
[02:35:26.948 --> 02:35:31.612]  And it's funny that they would even release it and expect you to think that there was a plane there.
[02:35:32.165 --> 02:35:39.731]  Well, I think what they want to do, Mrs. Taube, is raise the debate so they can later bring out CRISPR fake video.
[02:35:39.891 --> 02:35:41.372]  That's what I see happening.
[02:35:41.953 --> 02:35:46.537]  Let's play this final clip, and then, who is it you're confronting particularly in this clip?
[02:35:47.057 --> 02:35:52.161]  This is Jamie Gorelick, and she's one of the KEEM Commission members also.
[02:35:52.782 --> 02:35:53.923]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:35:53.983 --> 02:35:54.343]  Here it is.
[02:36:14.057 --> 02:36:16.139]  And she's literally yelling as they drag her out of the dorm.
[02:36:42.874 --> 02:36:47.677]  Everywhere these creeps go, everywhere these cover-up artists travel, we need to confront them.
[02:36:47.717 --> 02:36:49.239]  We need to speak out against them.
[02:36:49.699 --> 02:36:53.341]  We need to use the First Amendment while we still have a few shreds of it left.
[02:36:54.282 --> 02:36:59.446]  And I've even seen Cucker Carlson, of course, who's the grandson of a robber baron, just like
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:02.340]  Anderson Cooper is.
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:05.501]  I mean, literally, they can only find their own elite to go tell lies now.
[02:37:05.961 --> 02:37:09.442]  He admitted a few weeks ago, he said, this 9-11 truth movement, it's getting big.
[02:37:09.702 --> 02:37:10.682]  You're going to hear more of it.
[02:37:10.702 --> 02:37:11.522]  You're going to hear more.
[02:37:11.862 --> 02:37:15.743]  We have the Zogby polls between 66 and 50 percent, depending on which poll.
[02:37:15.763 --> 02:37:18.944]  I believe the government was involved now, not just covering up.
[02:37:19.384 --> 02:37:22.945]  We have CNN polls where it's 83 to 90 percent, depending on the poll.
[02:37:24.005 --> 02:37:28.306]  I go on all these other talk radio shows and do interviews, even with hostile
[02:37:29.227 --> 02:37:30.648]  A host attacking me.
[02:37:31.128 --> 02:37:34.211]  Most of the callers, if not all the callers, call in and agree with me.
[02:37:34.832 --> 02:37:36.273]  Same thing on my own talk show.
[02:37:37.154 --> 02:37:38.595]  Same thing on my own TV show.
[02:37:38.896 --> 02:37:39.977]  We don't screen the calls.
[02:37:41.198 --> 02:37:47.183]  I've had hosts throw fits and admit their screening calls when I'm a guest and say, no one's calling in to disagree with him!
[02:37:47.484 --> 02:37:48.605]  It must be a full moon!
[02:37:48.645 --> 02:37:49.686]  I'm ending this interview!
[02:37:49.726 --> 02:37:50.827]  You're all crazy!
[02:37:51.807 --> 02:37:55.149]  And so they've got a big problem on their hands.
[02:37:55.490 --> 02:38:06.517]  The exponential growth, the 9-11 Truth Movement, all of the other corruption coming out, all of the other facts coming out, this administration and the controllers that are manipulating it are in trouble.
[02:38:06.557 --> 02:38:15.243]  That's why Ray McGovern said we're in great danger yesterday of our own government staging an even bigger terror attack very, very soon to get us into war with Iran.
[02:38:15.703 --> 02:38:18.685]  Comments to that, Gypsy Tob?
[02:38:19.867 --> 02:38:24.430]  Well, I'm hoping that there won't be another attack, even though I see that it's possible.
[02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:32.954]  But I think they're, since all the exposure of the 9-11 stuff, I think they are afraid of doing another attack.
[02:38:32.974 --> 02:38:39.058]  I think we would have had many more by now if we hadn't been doing our job and exposing them.
[02:38:39.921 --> 02:38:41.483]  I'm just hoping that it won't happen.
[02:38:55.718 --> 02:38:58.279]  Then we have the London bombing, clearly an inside job.
[02:38:58.419 --> 02:39:00.920]  Now most Brits and Poles believe that.
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:02.401]  That's why they had to shut up about that.
[02:39:02.421 --> 02:39:03.421]  You don't hear about it anymore.
[02:39:03.902 --> 02:39:07.423]  We are really fighting them and having an effect.
[02:39:07.503 --> 02:39:16.647]  I mean, we're going toe-to-toe with the biggest propaganda bureau in the world, the Allied Crime Syndicates, Gypsy, and we're actually starting to beat their butts.
[02:39:16.727 --> 02:39:20.249]  I'm sorry to use that term, but we're starting to kick their hind ends.
[02:39:21.509 --> 02:39:22.309]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:22.350 --> 02:39:23.170]  That's what's happening.
[02:39:24.554 --> 02:39:33.857]  The last few months have just accelerated so much and things are just hitting the fan big time now and it's really growing exponentially.
[02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:34.757]  There's no stopping it.
[02:39:34.777 --> 02:39:35.937]  Jim, do me a favor.
[02:39:36.097 --> 02:39:37.057]  Let's watch our language here.
[02:39:37.097 --> 02:39:38.558]  It's a family show, okay?
[02:39:38.818 --> 02:39:39.258]  Okay.
[02:39:39.318 --> 02:39:41.238]  I'll have to edit that out now when we re-order that.
[02:39:42.279 --> 02:39:43.019]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:39:43.039 --> 02:39:44.499]  Your accent couldn't really tell what you said.
[02:39:44.679 --> 02:39:45.419]  Maybe you said something else.
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:46.700]  The point here is that
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:50.223]  You know, it feels good to have the initiative.
[02:39:50.264 --> 02:39:51.025]  It feels good.
[02:39:51.625 --> 02:39:58.254]  Can you imagine what it was like for myself two months before 9-11 to go on the air and say they're going to attack the World Trade Center and claim their asset?
[02:39:58.274 --> 02:39:59.015]  Bin Laden did it.
[02:39:59.335 --> 02:40:01.598]  Or to go on the air day one and lay this out?
[02:40:02.119 --> 02:40:02.860]  Oh my God!
[02:40:04.198 --> 02:40:10.983]  Well, that's what I did, and I'm very, very proud, and it feels good to know that people like you are out there carrying the torch.
[02:40:12.044 --> 02:40:17.608]  Looking at the video, they look scared of you, this little woman, standing up and speaking out.
[02:40:17.768 --> 02:40:21.671]  They look like guilty people caught with their hands in the cookie jar.
[02:40:21.691 --> 02:40:22.832]  Can you expound on that?
[02:40:23.833 --> 02:40:27.415]  Yeah, and the thing is, when I was going to do it, I was really afraid.
[02:40:27.435 --> 02:40:30.898]  I was having all these nightmares about how I wasn't able to do it.
[02:40:31.474 --> 02:40:37.957]  And I finally went there, and once I confronted them, you know, you realize that they don't really have the power that you think they have.
[02:40:38.177 --> 02:40:42.059]  And once the truth comes out, they are completely powerless.
[02:40:42.159 --> 02:40:44.460]  They're just a bunch of chicken heads, quite frankly.
[02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:46.421]  And we shouldn't be afraid of them.
[02:40:46.441 --> 02:40:47.821]  It's really sad that we're afraid of them.
[02:40:47.861 --> 02:40:49.802]  That's how they're controlling us, is through fear.
[02:40:49.842 --> 02:40:52.584]  They don't really have the kind of power we think they have, you know.
[02:40:52.884 --> 02:40:55.585]  I'm sure you know the story of Ceausescu in Romania.
[02:40:56.969 --> 02:40:58.670]  Oh yeah, yeah, the President.
[02:40:58.850 --> 02:41:00.190]  Why don't you tell people what happened?
[02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:02.551]  That guy got overthrown in one day.
[02:41:02.571 --> 02:41:06.852]  Yeah, I don't have all the details of what happened.
[02:41:06.892 --> 02:41:13.594]  I just know that, yeah, it was a very horrible dictatorship, even worse than Russia from what I heard.
[02:41:13.654 --> 02:41:18.556]  The people were living without electricity and there was all kinds of repressions.
[02:41:19.076 --> 02:41:24.718]  I just know that like his body got dragged across the whole city and didn't he get like
[02:41:25.273 --> 02:41:31.707]  As soon as his verdict was pronounced that he was guilty, didn't he get like six bullets in him right away from the audience?
[02:41:32.008 --> 02:41:32.389]  Yes.
[02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:36.117]  Yeah, so people weren't going to let him out of that building.
[02:41:36.633 --> 02:41:37.033]  Alive.
[02:41:37.194 --> 02:41:40.116]  I mean, you could just tell how much anger there was in him.
[02:41:40.156 --> 02:41:48.323]  Well, he tortured and killed hundreds of thousands, but the point is, he wore these big, fancy military outfits, was totally oppressive, just for his own pleasure.
[02:41:48.723 --> 02:41:50.485]  They had surveillance cameras everywhere.
[02:41:51.085 --> 02:41:55.209]  And finally, just one day, grassroots, on the streets, people said, I'm sick of this!
[02:41:55.649 --> 02:41:57.651]  And the cops went, yeah, go ahead and do whatever you want!
[02:41:57.671 --> 02:41:58.672]  Yeah, we're sick of it!
[02:41:58.712 --> 02:41:59.112]  Yeah!
[02:41:59.533 --> 02:42:01.795]  And everybody started saying, you think the same?
[02:42:01.835 --> 02:42:02.516]  You think the same?
[02:42:02.536 --> 02:42:04.337]  We don't... Everybody hated it!
[02:42:04.678 --> 02:42:08.081]  Everybody knew it was a lie, they were afraid, and finally the dam broke.
[02:42:08.681 --> 02:42:09.522]  Right, right.
[02:42:10.003 --> 02:42:10.803]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:10.823 --> 02:42:12.105]  Exactly.
[02:42:12.245 --> 02:42:16.789]  With Russia, a similar thing happened, I think, when people decided that they've had enough.
[02:42:17.350 --> 02:42:19.191]  You know, things really changed in 91.
[02:42:20.452 --> 02:42:25.855]  I don't know, even though it was the government that initiated the coup and people just didn't put up with it.
[02:42:25.895 --> 02:42:30.877]  They just all went to the streets and they just, it was liberty or death at that point.
[02:42:32.738 --> 02:42:38.320]  So I think, you know, people are waking up and American people are waking up as well at this moment.
[02:42:39.952 --> 02:42:45.113]  Really amazing to witness this and we're really starting to win in a very obvious way.
[02:42:45.853 --> 02:42:48.054]  Things are just accelerating so much.
[02:42:48.074 --> 02:42:57.196]  Well, I'm finishing my new film, Terror Storm, and I'd like to put the video clips of you and others confronting these creatures as the extras.
[02:42:57.516 --> 02:42:59.076]  Do I have authorization to use that?
[02:42:59.397 --> 02:43:00.317]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:43:00.337 --> 02:43:01.057]  Absolutely.
[02:43:01.637 --> 02:43:01.797]  Good.
[02:43:01.837 --> 02:43:03.598]  Well, I'm going to get it there in the film.
[02:43:03.638 --> 02:43:04.658]  Thank you so much for that.
[02:43:04.678 --> 02:43:05.959]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:43:05.979 --> 02:43:06.999]  These will be all over the map.
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.341]  Let's go to Stewart in Texas, then Jason, Cindy, and Mark.
[02:43:10.721 --> 02:43:12.002]  That's all we have time for.
[02:43:12.442 --> 02:43:13.162]  Stewart in Texas.
[02:43:13.202 --> 02:43:21.286]  I think this is the Stewart I know who got sent to the free speech zone, and he did scream out at Keene and say it was an inside job.
[02:43:21.306 --> 02:43:23.367]  He did what I should have done.
[02:43:23.607 --> 02:43:23.967]  Go ahead.
[02:43:26.750 --> 02:43:30.072]  Yeah, I just broke a light whistle, I did.
[02:43:45.566 --> 02:43:47.907]  Yeah, we're going to have to drop you, Stuart, sorry.
[02:43:48.327 --> 02:43:49.127]  Sorry, it just did.
[02:43:49.687 --> 02:43:52.368]  And by the way, the new cell phones have come out and they're worse than the old one.
[02:43:52.388 --> 02:43:54.469]  People say, why do you keep this old cell phone?
[02:43:54.489 --> 02:43:56.050]  Which they're not going to let me have in about six months.
[02:43:56.470 --> 02:43:58.470]  I'll have to get the new trackable one if I want one.
[02:43:58.711 --> 02:43:59.731]  It's because it works.
[02:43:59.791 --> 02:44:00.471]  You can hear me.
[02:44:01.051 --> 02:44:03.072]  And these new cell phones are total junk.
[02:44:03.912 --> 02:44:05.413]  Sorry, Stuart, I wanted to hear from you.
[02:44:06.513 --> 02:44:08.614]  Jason in Maryland, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:44:09.491 --> 02:44:22.255]  Hi Alex, I was wondering, I read on the internet the other day about German and Czechoslovakian troops come through Canada and doing work and war games in our country today.
[02:44:22.295 --> 02:44:28.937]  I was wondering if you heard anything about that or what you know about which, what foreign troops are here and how many?
[02:44:29.918 --> 02:44:30.218]  Thank you.
[02:44:30.990 --> 02:44:32.631]  Well, it won't be like Red Dawn.
[02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:34.913]  We won't go with a bang, but with a whimper.
[02:44:34.993 --> 02:44:41.358]  It's just multinational forces, Mexican troops in New Orleans, Dutch troops, Dutch AWACS, British troops.
[02:44:41.418 --> 02:44:46.482]  I've been to urban warfare drills where they have foreign troops back in the late 90s admitting it's for domestic operations.
[02:44:46.902 --> 02:44:50.665]  We've got Fort Polk, Louisiana on video where they're training to put Americans in camps.
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:53.541]  You know, it's just the same thing over and over again.
[02:44:53.561 --> 02:44:58.703]  They signed a deal three years ago to quote, use Mexican and Canadian troops to quote, patrol America.
[02:44:59.183 --> 02:45:00.004]  So it's public.
[02:45:00.044 --> 02:45:01.104]  It's the American Union.
[02:45:01.484 --> 02:45:04.666]  Just like in the EU now, they use quote, foreign troops in different areas.
[02:45:05.066 --> 02:45:06.347]  You want to comment on that, Gypsy?
[02:45:08.608 --> 02:45:17.592]  Well, I don't really know as much about this, but I guess the idea of a world government is definitely, this is what it's about, I think.
[02:45:18.632 --> 02:45:20.673]  Because I guess Americans against Americans isn't
[02:45:21.533 --> 02:45:23.554]  They probably don't think it's going to work as good anymore.
[02:45:23.574 --> 02:45:27.055]  It's always better to put people of a different nationality against.
[02:45:27.755 --> 02:45:35.117]  Like in Russia, when they sent people to Afghanistan, and when people asked, so why should we shoot at the people there?
[02:45:35.137 --> 02:45:42.900]  And they said, because behind you will be these guys from, you know, also the Soviet Union, but from a different republic where people speak a different language.
[02:45:42.980 --> 02:45:45.060]  And they're going to shoot at you if you don't shoot at them.
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:49.482]  So they put people against each other who are unfamiliar with each other.
[02:45:49.502 --> 02:45:50.542]  I think it's easier
[02:45:51.198 --> 02:45:54.441]  It works better than, you know, when you have people fighting their own.
[02:45:54.541 --> 02:45:57.604]  You hit the nail on the old proverbial head there.
[02:45:57.705 --> 02:45:59.386]  Let's talk to Cindy in Delaware.
[02:45:59.466 --> 02:46:00.227]  Cindy, go ahead.
[02:46:00.247 --> 02:46:03.951]  Hi.
[02:46:04.291 --> 02:46:05.512]  Welcome to America, Jim.
[02:46:05.632 --> 02:46:07.915]  It's great.
[02:46:08.455 --> 02:46:09.436]  Good to have you here.
[02:46:09.917 --> 02:46:15.082]  Listen, I wanted to call Alex to tell you something that happened to a neighbor of mine last week.
[02:46:15.444 --> 02:46:22.170]  She called the police to report, you know, dialed 911 to report that she thought her son had been molested by an older boy.
[02:46:22.951 --> 02:46:32.219]  And when the police came out to her house, they responded with about 12 police, and four of them stood in front of her.
[02:46:32.299 --> 02:46:33.520]  She has a split-level house.
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:39.425]  Four of them stood in front of her so that she couldn't, you know, do anything but sit there on a couch.
[02:46:39.965 --> 02:46:42.988]  And the rest of them proceeded to go into her bedrooms
[02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:47.031]  Hers, her son's, they wanted to get into the locked office door.
[02:46:47.452 --> 02:46:49.572]  They even were going into the attic.
[02:46:50.473 --> 02:46:52.153]  Yeah, that's what happens.
[02:46:52.173 --> 02:46:56.515]  A lot of times when you call the police now, they come and search your house.
[02:46:57.575 --> 02:47:03.878]  And she said to them, hey, I know enough to know if you don't have a search warrant, you can't be doing that.
[02:47:03.958 --> 02:47:06.499]  And that has nothing to do with why I called you.
[02:47:06.979 --> 02:47:08.120]  And you know what they told her, Alex?
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:11.461]  They said, ma'am, we have to clear the area.
[02:47:12.443 --> 02:47:13.323]  Clear the area!
[02:47:13.584 --> 02:47:16.625]  Now, I almost couldn't believe it when she told me this story.
[02:47:16.645 --> 02:47:22.548]  So the next day, I went and called the, you know, the regular police station.
[02:47:23.008 --> 02:47:27.390]  And a woman officer answered, and she told me, she goes, oh yeah, I do that all the time.
[02:47:27.630 --> 02:47:31.952]  Whenever I go into a house on a call, I clear the area first to make sure there's no one else there.
[02:47:32.432 --> 02:47:34.453]  I said, isn't that a good stopping tactic?
[02:47:36.778 --> 02:47:42.390]  Well, it's one thing if there's been a shooting or a robbery, you think there's a burglar, but I mean, none of you...
[02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:44.440]  Well, the same thing's happened to me.
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:47.021]  I've called the police and my car's been stolen in Dallas.
[02:47:47.081 --> 02:47:48.141]  I'm at a girlfriend's house.
[02:47:48.681 --> 02:47:50.301]  And they go, we're going to search this apartment.
[02:47:50.441 --> 02:47:53.262]  And they searched it and they go, do you have any weapons?
[02:47:53.322 --> 02:47:55.702]  And you're like, no, my car got stolen.
[02:47:56.402 --> 02:47:58.843]  And it's just this mentality.
[02:47:58.883 --> 02:47:59.823]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:00.783 --> 02:48:04.864]  Gypsy, was it like that in Russia where if you called the police they'd end up rifling through your stuff?
[02:48:05.344 --> 02:48:08.945]  You know what, believe it or not, it was totally different.
[02:48:09.065 --> 02:48:11.105]  Our police were not allowed to carry weapons.
[02:48:11.610 --> 02:48:14.532]  And you would hardly ever see a policeman on the street.
[02:48:14.572 --> 02:48:16.353]  You're lucky if you saw them once a week.
[02:48:16.874 --> 02:48:17.654]  Or even less.
[02:48:18.055 --> 02:48:20.156]  There were not nearly as many cops there.
[02:48:20.476 --> 02:48:21.657]  We were never searched.
[02:48:22.598 --> 02:48:25.040]  But statistically you had lower crime too, right?
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:27.541]  I'm not sure we may have had lower crime.
[02:48:27.781 --> 02:48:29.743]  I know that a lot of our crime was not reported.
[02:48:30.214 --> 02:48:31.116]  I think fear.
[02:48:31.156 --> 02:48:34.322]  People had a lot of fear, so the fear itself ruled people pretty well.
[02:48:34.482 --> 02:48:35.163]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:48:35.183 --> 02:48:35.464]  Stay there.
[02:48:35.484 --> 02:48:37.347]  We'll talk about it more on the other side.
[02:48:37.447 --> 02:48:42.015]  Less searches back when she lived in the Soviet Union, in Moscow.
[02:48:42.035 --> 02:48:43.298]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.413 --> 02:48:52.258]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.558 --> 02:48:53.939]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.139 --> 02:48:56.340]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:58.582]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.862 --> 02:49:03.785]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.125 --> 02:49:08.148]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.408 --> 02:49:10.189]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.209 --> 02:49:20.914]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.054 --> 02:49:22.955]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.155 --> 02:49:27.017]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.
[02:49:27.117 --> 02:49:28.338]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[02:49:28.538 --> 02:49:28.758]  That's 888-2533139.
[02:49:35.481 --> 02:49:39.206]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:49:39.466 --> 02:49:40.187]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.049 --> 02:49:50.253]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.413 --> 02:49:58.499]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:58.759 --> 02:50:05.804]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.745 --> 02:50:13.250]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.430 --> 02:50:18.514]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.634 --> 02:50:27.522]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:50:27.782 --> 02:50:31.084]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:33.166 --> 02:50:34.007]  We're good to go!
[02:51:01.608 --> 02:51:02.209]  I think so.
[02:51:21.749 --> 02:51:23.450]  We'll take a final call from Mark in Canada.
[02:51:50.427 --> 02:51:52.230]  Our guest, Mr. Tao, will finish up.
[02:51:52.871 --> 02:51:56.335]  Before we do that, tickets are really starting to go fast.
[02:51:57.697 --> 02:52:05.828]  For our big 9-11 Symposium, American Scholar Symposium, we're putting on in Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:52:07.887 --> 02:52:11.168]  And you now got, what, 24 days to get your tickets.

[02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:26.435]  We're going to have Ray McGovern there.
[02:52:26.855 --> 02:52:28.896]  He's only been to one other 9-11 event, folks.
[02:52:28.936 --> 02:52:30.116]  He's going to do a big presentation.
[02:52:30.437 --> 02:52:31.117]  The former head
[02:52:31.989 --> 02:52:35.472]  The Star Wars program will be exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[02:52:35.933 --> 02:52:40.217]  We're going to have Professor Stephen Jones, the physicist, exposing it.
[02:52:41.458 --> 02:52:47.083]  So many other people, surprise guests, you can probably guess who that'll be, but they want to be a surprise.
[02:52:48.984 --> 02:52:49.685]  Get your tickets.
[02:52:49.745 --> 02:52:51.467]  We're adding a student discount.

[02:52:56.767 --> 02:52:58.448]  Well, a ticket is $74.
[02:52:58.508 --> 02:53:00.128]  It's so expensive to put this on in LA.
[02:53:00.488 --> 02:53:02.249]  The student discount is $45.
[02:53:03.189 --> 02:53:11.412]  And we're also offering a discount with a code we're sending out to people that have purchased off our shopping cart to get 10% off any ticket purchase.

[02:53:15.533 --> 02:53:16.613]  This is as good as it gets.
[02:53:16.953 --> 02:53:18.434]  This event is going to be awesome.

[02:53:42.328 --> 02:53:42.748]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:44.329 --> 02:53:45.930]  Final caller, Mark in Canada.
[02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:47.311]  A lot of calls from Canada today.
[02:53:47.611 --> 02:53:48.372]  You're on the air, Mark.
[02:53:49.454 --> 02:53:52.196]  Hey Alex, I just had a quick question.
[02:53:52.776 --> 02:53:56.658]  Is it possible for Arnold to be the President?
[02:53:56.738 --> 02:53:59.079]  And if he does get in, is there going to be trouble?
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:01.841]  Well, they were trying to position him nationally.
[02:54:01.901 --> 02:54:03.001]  Now he's in trouble.
[02:54:03.382 --> 02:54:07.684]  I think we beat that back for now, but they've said they want to position him for President.
[02:54:07.704 --> 02:54:12.807]  They've introduced legislation to remove and change the Constitution so he can.
[02:54:12.827 --> 02:54:16.269]  Okay, well I hope he doesn't because
[02:54:17.694 --> 02:54:18.474]  That could be scary.
[02:54:18.534 --> 02:54:28.237]  Also, do you know if there's going to be some sort of March for Truth or something, some sort of event in Washington or New York on September 11th?
[02:54:28.277 --> 02:54:29.458]  Yes sir, there always is.
[02:54:29.498 --> 02:54:32.099]  There's a bunch of different groups that do that and they all join up together.
[02:54:32.499 --> 02:54:33.259]  Thank you for the call.
[02:54:33.719 --> 02:54:36.600]  GypsyTown, here in closing, any other comments?
[02:54:38.141 --> 02:54:45.023]  Loose Change are doing, it's going to be the 5th anniversary of 9-11 and Loose Change are inviting everybody to Ground Zero.
[02:54:46.264 --> 02:54:47.344]  of this year for 9-11.
[02:54:47.404 --> 02:54:47.925]  Absolutely.
[02:54:48.805 --> 02:54:55.867]  And I just wanted to also say, Alex, that I really admire you and you're definitely my hero.
[02:54:55.887 --> 02:54:59.528]  And thank you for your courage and for your passion.
[02:54:59.708 --> 02:55:07.891]  And one thing I have to say, one thing I like about you so much is that you're yourself and you're not afraid of what you're saying.
[02:55:07.911 --> 02:55:10.011]  You're not afraid of being not politically correct.
[02:55:10.031 --> 02:55:12.272]  You don't suck up to the right and you don't suck up to the left.
[02:55:13.246 --> 02:55:13.746]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:13.766 --> 02:55:16.188]  Well, people like you, Gypsy, are my heroes.
[02:55:16.768 --> 02:55:18.189]  I mean, I'm just doing what I have to.
[02:55:18.229 --> 02:55:26.174]  We've got criminal, murdering pieces of trash running our government, engaging in every crime imaginable and even unimaginable.
[02:55:26.414 --> 02:55:28.376]  Whatever you can imagine, it's far worse, folks.
[02:55:28.416 --> 02:55:30.657]  I've learned that one thing in all of this.
[02:55:31.017 --> 02:55:32.438]  They've got to be brought to heel.
[02:55:32.478 --> 02:55:34.099]  They've got to be brought under control.
[02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:36.321]  Corruption either gets worse or it gets better.
[02:55:36.341 --> 02:55:37.581]  It doesn't stay in one position.
[02:55:37.942 --> 02:55:39.122]  And right now, it's getting worse.
[02:55:39.583 --> 02:55:41.404]  Gypsy, any websites you want to give out?
[02:55:43.132 --> 02:55:54.174]  I just started a website called hippynewsnetwork.com, and I'm going to be posting videos of nuclear cover-up that our government is doing, which is totally horrible.
[02:55:54.394 --> 02:55:54.614]  Good, good.
[02:55:54.634 --> 02:55:56.735]  hippynewsnetwork.com, thank you for joining us.
[02:55:57.855 --> 02:55:58.375]  Take care.
[02:55:58.855 --> 02:56:00.075]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:00.115 --> 02:56:01.355]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:01.455 --> 02:56:02.936]  Get out there, expose the globalists.
[02:56:03.316 --> 02:56:04.376]  Expose the New World Order.
[02:56:04.956 --> 02:56:09.317]  Let these people know we're not going to put up with their corruption, their tyranny, any longer.
[02:56:10.658 --> 02:56:11.598]  And get my videos.
[02:56:11.678 --> 02:56:13.759]  Get them and make copies and get them out to people.
[02:56:13.799 --> 02:56:15.379]  I want to thank those that have.
[02:56:15.399 --> 02:56:16.319]  It's been so effective.
[02:56:16.359 --> 02:56:18.140]  If you haven't, take action now.
[02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:21.320]  They're powerful films and it makes this broadcast possible.
[02:56:21.621 --> 02:56:23.161]  God bless you all!
