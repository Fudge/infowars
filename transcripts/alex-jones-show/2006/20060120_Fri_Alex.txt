[00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:05.426]  There are many people asking questions.
[00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:09.048]  There are many people asking why.
[00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:13.670]  There are many people paying attention.
[00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.212]  There are many now who seem to be alive.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.614]  There are many folks who want to get busy.
[00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.375]  And you're creating a mess.
[00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:24.996]  Good morning!
[00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.523]  Good afternoon, good evening ladies and gentlemen wherever you're situated on this great big beautiful blue globe floating through the void of y'all's creation.
[00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:39.287]  It's Friday the 20th of January 2005 and I don't know where this one came from.
[00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:47.992]  Joyce just threw this at me just before the mic went live and after reading this supposed verbatim quote from G.W.
[00:00:48.072 --> 00:00:51.634]  Bush anybody who saw this on television has
[00:00:52.114 --> 00:01:04.337]  They've got to be brain dead if they don't recognize that we're at the crossroads and are asking themselves the question, where is my line in the sand?
[00:01:05.157 --> 00:01:06.337]  This is Dave Van Clyde.
[00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:07.018]  And Joyce Riley.
[00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:08.918]  We'll tell you what that's all about in just a few minutes.
[00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:10.578]  I sure hope she doesn't.
[00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:20.523]  If he said this, he needs to be taken to a place that can protect him with rubber walls real soon, I think.
[00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:20.903]  Oh, man!
[00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:33.609]  Anyway, we are going to be talking about the news, and the news that they say is news is, ladies and gentlemen, of course, the lead story on CNN, major news networks today, is the Osama Bin Laden tape.
[00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:40.812]  We're going to talk about this tape, and if anybody believes that that's the real deal, then you know why we have bad intel.
[00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:44.602]  The CIA has now confirmed that this tape is true.
[00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:56.857]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know that you are so sick of the wag the dog government that we have, but it is absolutely in your face with this Bin Laden tape.
[00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.243]  Now, of course, this is a tape that allegedly was released.
[00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:08.927]  It's an alleged tape, allegedly released in December, allegedly by Osama Bin Laden, carried allegedly by Al Jazeera.
[00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:18.532]  And if you missed the discussion we had about Al Jazeera yesterday, then you know that Al Jazeera probably is not even the real deal, for sure, too.
[00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:20.793]  But anyway, that's supposed to be the big story.
[00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:25.676]  Now, we'll get into this because I think the Jill Carroll story dovetails into this.
[00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:30.595]  Right along with the story of We've Got Another Tape, We've Got Another Tape.
[00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:33.836]  Michael Fortier is going to be released from prison.
[00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:34.936]  Remember who he is?
[00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:36.217]  We'll talk about that.
[00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:42.959]  Also, the Japanese, as of this morning, have now banned American beef again today.
[00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.980]  Don't know much about that story, but that's going to be a big hit to our industry over here.
[00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:51.977]  And, uh, let's look at what the real news is.
[00:02:52.037 --> 00:03:06.147]  The serious news is that Google has now been asked by the government to provide millions of requests over where you've been on the internet, who you've been looking at, and of course this is all because people might be looking at pornography.
[00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:07.348]  That's the reason.
[00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:08.209]  Yeah, right.
[00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.029]  Yeah, that's the reason.
[00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.590]  Right.
[00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.496]  A new cancer treatment in the Spice Cabinet.
[00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:18.901]  Yeah, this was a big story from the, are you ready for this, the American Cancer Society.
[00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.264]  The Spice Cabinet has your answer.
[00:03:22.764 --> 00:03:24.746]  Now just which Spice do you think that is?
[00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:25.626]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:30.250]  And we have a Power Hour team member of the day.
[00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:35.714]  For approaching Congressman Thompson and handing him a copy of Beyond Treason.
[00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:36.235]  Whoa!
[00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:37.576]  It made the newspaper.
[00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.489]  Really?
[00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.189]  At Fort Bragg.
[00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.729]  Cool.
[00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:40.710]  It made the newspaper.
[00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.610]  He is our team member of the day.
[00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.370]  We'll tell you why.
[00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.131]  And also, how many presidents do you think have been left-handed?
[00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:47.691]  We talked about it yesterday.
[00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.572]  Well, we have Len's answer here.
[00:03:51.012 --> 00:03:54.253]  If you're listening on the International Shortwave, we thank you for doing so.
[00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:56.493]  We broadcast live from 7 to 10 a.m.

[00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:13.604]  On WHI, 9.840 for all three hours, and on WHRI, 7.520 for the first hour of this hour, and then the second and third hours, that frequency changes to 11.785.
[00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:16.806]  Such is the case with WWCR.
[00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:27.514]  The first hour is 5.765, and in 55 minutes, you'll have to change that receiver to 7.465 for the second and third hours of this three hour broadcast.
[00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.755]  The evening replay goes out from 9 to 12 midnight central time.
[00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:33.437]  That's 0300 to 0600 UTC on WHRA 5.850 for the first and second hours.
[00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:35.918]  And then the third hour changes to 7.555 on the internet.
[00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.063]  At ThePowerHour.com, and we thank all of the people online listening to the program.
[00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:49.164]  Thank you so much.
[00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:54.907]  And also, the folks listening on the AM and FM stations dotted around the country, you folks got work to do.
[00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:59.491]  Write down the local advertiser, give them your business, call them up and say, Thank you!
[00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.924]  September 11, 2001 changed the world, and the world is now realizing that the official story of that infamous day just doesn't make sense.
[00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:12.628]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that there is a government cover-up, according to a CNN poll.
[00:05:12.648 --> 00:05:21.715]  9-11 In Plain Sight, the director's cut, is a compilation of unaltered news footage and photos from major networks and publications that raises questions that officials dare not ask, let alone answer.
[00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:30.002]  The worldwide firestorm of questions raised has forced some into a position of desperation damage control to keep this documentary from being seen or accepted by the masses.
[00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:35.185]  Why have these efforts been made to keep you from seeing this documentary and simply asking common sense questions?
[00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:35.846]  Find out.
[00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:40.449]  You must see 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut and share it with as many people as possible.

[00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:10.409]  And Joyce Riley.
[00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:15.593]  And we all know knowledge is power, and that's why we call this... The Power Hour!
[00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:30.962]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.503]  Yes, what is it now?
[00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:34.364]  I have him outside, sir.
[00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:35.325]  Shall I bring him in?
[00:08:36.045 --> 00:08:37.046]  Yes, bring him in.
[00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:41.999]  Yes, sir.
[00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:42.679]  What is it?
[00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.341]  Listen, you boob.
[00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:48.824]  You'd better learn how to speak the English language.
[00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:57.911]  I've heard you speaking on that radio program where the opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the staff management or sponsors of this radio station.
[00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:01.834]  Now, you've done that disclaimer and botched it every single time.
[00:09:02.054 --> 00:09:03.355]  I want you to say it right now.
[00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:13.150]  The opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily... Shut up!
[00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.650]  Sit down!
[00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.070]  Necessarily.
[00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.590]  Necessarily.
[00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.330]  Necessarily.
[00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.330]  Say it!
[00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:18.751]  Necessarily.
[00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:30.833]  Those of the staff.
[00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.274]  Those of... of the staff?
[00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:35.695]  Management.
[00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:37.776]  Management?
[00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.617]  Or sponsors of this radio station.
[00:09:40.397 --> 00:09:43.019]  Or sponsors of this radio station.
[00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:44.739]  Very good.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.681]  Now go and do it right next time.
[00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:50.422]  Okay.
[00:09:51.062 --> 00:09:51.603]  Okay, I will.
[00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:51.923]  I will.
[00:09:57.657 --> 00:10:00.399]  Well, I guess we know who he answers to.
[00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:02.561]  Oh, man.
[00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:05.323]  I guess we know who's in charge of him.
[00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:06.744]  No kidding, no kidding.
[00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:10.027]  Welcome to the Friday edition of the Power Hour.
[00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.929]  We all know that GW is not the leader of the free world.
[00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:17.352]  Come on, anybody that actually believes that has got to believe in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny.
[00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:20.855]  I mean, golly, if this man is the leader of the free world,
[00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.392]  As Paul Lin used to say, we're in trouble.
[00:10:24.512 --> 00:10:25.632]  I know, we are in trouble.
[00:10:25.853 --> 00:10:28.314]  And you know what Dave, I think they're going to have to retract something.
[00:10:28.654 --> 00:10:30.375]  Remember that book called Bush's Brain?
[00:10:30.616 --> 00:10:30.936]  Yeah.
[00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:32.497]  I think they're going to have to retract that.
[00:10:33.037 --> 00:10:33.998]  Retract his brain?
[00:10:34.058 --> 00:10:35.479]  Well, there's been no evidence found.
[00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:37.140]  And he has one!
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:43.444]  I know, but you know, and when people hear this statement a little bit later that we're going to read about him, I think they will understand what you're talking about.
[00:10:43.504 --> 00:10:44.644]  Anyway, welcome to the Power Hour.
[00:10:44.684 --> 00:10:45.205]  This is Joyce.
[00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:46.025]  And this is Dave.
[00:10:46.205 --> 00:10:49.547]  And as you have been listening to the television, oh please, I hope not.
[00:10:49.807 --> 00:10:50.588]  I hope not.
[00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.345]  Here's the main story of the day.
[00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:56.729]  Osama Bin Laden released, or excuse me, excuse me.
[00:10:57.129 --> 00:11:06.877]  Allegedly, Osama Bin Laden released an alleged tape with the alleged message that they're not over, not finished with the United States.
[00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:11.160]  The war against America will not be confined to Iraq.
[00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:19.627]  Now this is the scary part, because even if it's not a real tape, then you know it's a CIA tape, which doesn't surprise any of the Power Hour listeners.
[00:11:20.322 --> 00:11:24.246]  But he says, it will not be confined to Iraq.
[00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:25.707]  The war will not be confined.
[00:11:26.548 --> 00:11:29.110]  Another attack is in the works.
[00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:32.353]  In the heart of the land.
[00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:36.837]  That's the alleged statement, allegedly by Osama Bin Laden.
[00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:43.988]  Which tells us, yeah, they're preparing something, yeah, they're trying to get everybody ready, yeah, they've got to do something, because you know what happened?
[00:11:44.428 --> 00:11:46.349]  The Pakistan issue backfired in their face.
[00:11:46.389 --> 00:12:01.994]  They hit a bunch of innocent people, killed a bunch of children there, all the time saying, well, we thought that this guy was there, and, you know, they just have the right to go into any country and bomb anybody if they think somebody might be there with their bad intel that has never proven to be right in the past.
[00:12:02.414 --> 00:12:05.375]  I mean, remember when Bill Clinton bombed an aspirin factory?
[00:12:06.252 --> 00:12:09.694]  It's not just George Bush's administration that's doing all this.
[00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:13.176]  So now we've got a situation in which they've got a bunch of bad PR.
[00:12:13.576 --> 00:12:16.417]  And they want to go after Iran for all the wrong reasons.
[00:12:16.477 --> 00:12:18.378]  But be that as it may, they want to go get Iran.
[00:12:18.718 --> 00:12:21.620]  So they've got to set the stage and create all the atrocities again.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.782]  So get ready for all the women who've had their left hand cut off.
[00:12:26.462 --> 00:12:29.024]  And all the women who had, you know, I mean, just get ready for it.
[00:12:29.104 --> 00:12:30.744]  Because they have to do it to create a war.
[00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:33.646]  Because they can't create a war legitimately.
[00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:35.583]  So now what are we doing?
[00:12:35.883 --> 00:12:42.307]  Well, we're picking at everything the President of Iran says to prove that we've got to go over there and nuke this guy.
[00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:47.971]  Do you think that we're going to go nuke them before long or we're going to go attack Iran?
[00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:51.514]  I think everybody does because on television right now you are seeing it.
[00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:53.475]  Well, they're upping the ante.
[00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:56.137]  The plans are on the table.
[00:12:57.088 --> 00:13:14.493]  So the first time I get a phone call from some major network media source who wants somebody who will look good in front of the TV set and be a good commentator for the next war then you know we're about ready to go to war and you can be assured I will let you know.
[00:13:16.154 --> 00:13:25.397]  Alright so we've got this problem with Osama Bin Laden's tape now which a lot of people are saying is a phony tape because all you have to do is look at it and by the way there is no sound on it because
[00:13:26.218 --> 00:13:30.181]  There is no sound, so they can do whatever they want to do with the sound.
[00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:35.405]  So, they've got another problem also, and that is, people don't want the war with Iran.
[00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:36.506]  They don't want it, period.
[00:13:36.526 --> 00:13:37.307]  They don't want the war with Iraq!
[00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:40.988]  They don't want the war with Afghanistan, let alone a new war.
[00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:44.810]  You know, I want to jump, before you go right past that, there's no sound on the tape.
[00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.512]  This is not the first time this has happened.
[00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:56.238]  There's so many times where they will play a video of the quote-unquote Osama speaking, but they never allow you to hear the audio part of the tape.
[00:13:56.258 --> 00:14:02.402]  Now there are a lot of folks out there that speak the language that could translate what he's saying, but maybe they don't want you to hear exactly what he's saying.
[00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:05.004]  They want to literally put the words in his mouth.
[00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.905]  Or maybe he's not saying anything.
[00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:08.466]  Or maybe this is an old tape.
[00:14:08.506 --> 00:14:11.627]  Or maybe they just made a whole bunch of footage of it and said, we'll just use this as we need it.
[00:14:11.988 --> 00:14:14.969]  Well, there's a Duke professor who is now skeptical of the Bin Laden tape.
[00:14:15.409 --> 00:14:20.752]  This Duke professor says that he is doubtful about Thursday's audio tape from Osama Bin Laden.
[00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:24.154]  Well, you and every Power Hour listener out there.
[00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:29.757]  Or, yes, you sir, Bruce Lawrence, and every Genesis listener out there.
[00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:36.445]  Well, he has just published Messages to the World, the statements of Osama Bin Laden, a book translating Bin Laden's writings.
[00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:37.805]  He is skeptical.
[00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:41.806]  The guy who wrote the book on his messages is skeptical of Thursday's message.
[00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:42.486]  But you know what?
[00:14:43.326 --> 00:14:45.607]  I'm skeptical of Bruce Lawrence's message.
[00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:50.628]  Because when you read his reasons why, they're not the real reasons.
[00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:53.609]  It's another rabbit trail for you to follow.
[00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:56.850]  Lawrence says, it was like a voice from the grave.
[00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.931]  He thinks Bin Laden is dead and has doubts about the tape.
[00:15:00.407 --> 00:15:05.749]  Lawrence recently analyzed more than 20 complete speeches and interviews of the Al-Qaeda leader for the book.
[00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:08.750]  He says the new message is missing several key elements.
[00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.192]  Well, if he believed all the other 20 messages, then I don't believe him now.
[00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.372]  That's my position.
[00:15:14.772 --> 00:15:17.013]  There's nothing, he says, in this from the Koran.
[00:15:19.354 --> 00:15:19.434]  Oh.
[00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:20.314]  Okay.
[00:15:20.775 --> 00:15:24.356]  He, by his own standards, a faithful Muslim, Lawrence said,
[00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:26.656]  He quotes scripture in defense of his actions.
[00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:30.098]  There's no quotations from the Quran in the excerpts that we got.
[00:15:30.218 --> 00:15:33.660]  No reference to specific events, no reference to past atrocities.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.682]  Okay, that's supposed to be a reason that we don't pay any attention to this.
[00:15:37.923 --> 00:15:38.743]  Doesn't fly with me.
[00:15:39.323 --> 00:15:47.148]  When the CIA confirms the voice on the tape is Bin Laden's, and by the way, this time the CIA did confirm it is Bin Laden.
[00:15:47.568 --> 00:15:49.229]  Now remember, all the past times
[00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:57.278]  It's been allegedly Osama Bin Laden could be most likely Osama Bin Laden.
[00:15:57.638 --> 00:16:04.780]  Now they've out and out said this is the voice of Osama Bin Laden but unfortunately you didn't get to hear it so I mean there's no way we can test that.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.701]  Lawrence questions when it was recorded.
[00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:12.183]  He says the timing of the release could be to divert attention from last week's US airstrike in Pakistan.
[00:16:12.203 --> 00:16:13.503]  I'm glad he agrees with me on that.
[00:16:13.883 --> 00:16:16.584]  The strike targeted Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri
[00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:23.307]  So if he believes in Ayman al-Zarari, you know, he's the physician who's number two, who always has a gun behind him whenever he does an interview.
[00:16:23.908 --> 00:16:32.972]  Well, it led to the failed military operations where America got blamed, but the people who are really to blame are the ones who provided the intelligence.
[00:16:33.813 --> 00:16:39.276]  I think this is an effort to say we're not going to be looking at the terrible incident and about what happened.
[00:16:39.476 --> 00:16:40.876]  Now he's talking about Pakistan, evidently.
[00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:45.539]  Another element that Lawrence takes issue with is Bin Laden's latest message is its length.
[00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:47.369]  Now look how weak this is.
[00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:49.770]  The length of the message is only 10 minutes.
[00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.371]  The shortest part of this was 18 minutes.
[00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.811]  See, nothing has anything to do with anything.
[00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:57.752]  I think that Mr. Lawrence is a rabbit trail.
[00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:02.113]  Now, at the same time you understand that we want to go get Iran, get Iran, get Iran.
[00:17:02.193 --> 00:17:03.033]  All terrorists are bad.
[00:17:03.393 --> 00:17:04.393]  All Muslims are bad.
[00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:07.994]  Just, you know, put them all together and let God sort them out.
[00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:14.196]  The reason that I think that Joe Carroll, who is this poor 28-year-old reporter,
[00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:38.503]  I mean, how sympathetic would you be if a Halliburton welder got, and I'm not putting down Halliburton welders, please don't misunderstand, but how sympathetic would you be to go to war because a Halliburton welder who was making $180,000 every six months got kidnapped?
[00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:42.033]  Wouldn't work, right?
[00:17:42.413 --> 00:17:50.999]  So we've got Jill Conrad, who really cares about the Iraqi people, who was over there to expose the atrocities of Iraq, with the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.461]  That will get your attention, right?
[00:17:53.561 --> 00:17:56.023]  Now that's going to pull your heart strings just a little bit more.
[00:17:56.383 --> 00:17:57.944]  Well, that's who they're using now.
[00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.145]  And I mean using.
[00:18:00.466 --> 00:18:01.627]  And I think it is so sad.
[00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:06.230]  And remember, Christian Science Monitor might be getting their hands slapped.
[00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.291]  Might, I say.
[00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:09.267]  Because remember the article they did?
[00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:14.629]  That there's a thousand times the amount of normal background radiation in Iraq now because of depleted uranium?
[00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:18.330]  Too bad, you shouldn't have done the story.
[00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.091]  Now your girl is missing.
[00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:21.571]  Oh, could they be that mean?
[00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:23.412]  Well, let's think.
[00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:27.273]  If they could kill 3,000 people in New York City, could they be that mean?
[00:18:28.153 --> 00:18:28.733]  Yes, they could.
[00:18:29.113 --> 00:18:31.994]  So, Jill Carroll is the victim now.
[00:18:32.214 --> 00:18:33.374]  Now, why would the Iraqis pick
[00:18:35.774 --> 00:18:39.236]  Jill Carroll, who's over there exposing the Iraqi people's interests.
[00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:41.117]  Really, that's the first thought that came to my mind.
[00:18:41.197 --> 00:18:53.422]  I mean, she's been trying to help the Iraqis and help their cause, and the Science Christian Monitor has been trying to expose what the United States has done to the entire region with the DU issue.
[00:18:53.642 --> 00:18:57.024]  They also did a series about the Gulf War illness several years ago.
[00:18:57.064 --> 00:18:59.905]  I mean, the Christian Science Monitor has been trying to help the Iraqi people.
[00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:02.967]  So why don't they go get some general in the Green Zone?
[00:19:03.607 --> 00:19:07.588]  If they want to make a statement, no, they're not going to do that.
[00:19:08.008 --> 00:19:10.329]  Because I don't think we're going to go get our own guys.
[00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:14.351]  Well, that remains to be seen.
[00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:15.971]  I may be proven wrong on that one.
[00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:23.734]  So, now we've got this alleged message though from Osama Bin Laden that says another attack is in the works.
[00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:29.255]  And he says the reason we haven't already done it is because we're busy planning the next one.
[00:19:31.016 --> 00:19:31.336]  Duh!
[00:19:31.892 --> 00:19:33.353]  This appeals to Bubba on the couch.
[00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:34.034]  I have to tell you.
[00:19:34.394 --> 00:19:38.078]  And the next one is going to be in the heart of the land.
[00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:40.800]  I wonder what that means.
[00:19:41.201 --> 00:19:41.881]  Heartland?
[00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:43.423]  Heart of the land?
[00:19:44.263 --> 00:19:44.944]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:45.204 --> 00:19:52.211]  Michael Fortier is going to be released from prison and Dr. Doug Rocky is upset at the treatment he's getting.
[00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:53.012]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:19:53.032 --> 00:19:54.493]  Stay tuned after this four minute break.
[00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:05.344]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?

[00:23:53.937 --> 00:23:57.485]  Try Vitamir and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:15.782]  In Oklahoma City, one fateful April day, the lives of many innocents were taken all away.
[00:24:16.502 --> 00:24:21.304]  At first the truth was broadcast for all to see and hear.
[00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:23.064]  I think he said another bomb.
[00:24:23.104 --> 00:24:24.264]  Oh my God, another bomb!
[00:24:24.324 --> 00:24:25.985]  People ran in fear.
[00:24:26.205 --> 00:24:31.047]  The helicopter flied by, but the traitor wasn't there.
[00:24:31.727 --> 00:24:35.628]  Sophisticated bombs were found, but vanishing things.
[00:24:36.124 --> 00:24:40.965]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday edition of the Power Hour.
[00:24:40.985 --> 00:24:44.686]  Of course, the name of the song is, OK, Can You See?
[00:24:44.726 --> 00:24:47.667]  And it's on the album, Music to Die For.
[00:24:47.687 --> 00:24:49.547]  This is Dave Arnquist.
[00:24:49.607 --> 00:24:52.268]  And, Joyce Riley, you can get that by calling 877-817-9829, and you will get the Bush
[00:24:57.288 --> 00:24:58.469]  Bumper music, you call it.
[00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:00.730]  I call it the Bush Funny Music.
[00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.952]  But you can get that by calling 877-817-9829.
[00:25:05.693 --> 00:25:11.036]  You buy the CD for $15 and you get the Bush Funny Music free.
[00:25:11.616 --> 00:25:13.637]  The Bush Bonus Bumper Disc.
[00:25:13.697 --> 00:25:13.957]  Yes.
[00:25:14.398 --> 00:25:14.838]  Okay.
[00:25:15.738 --> 00:25:18.760]  Michael Fortier is going to be released from prison today.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.342]  Of course you recall he was the star witness
[00:25:22.927 --> 00:25:27.870]  Some said he was the star set-up witness against Tim McVeigh.
[00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:45.360]  The whole idea now is to resurrect the Oklahoma City bombing atrocity, so that's what they're doing now, is dragging out of the back room all of these poor people who have suffered horribly over the past ten years, dragging them in front of the media and, oh wasn't it horrible when your loved one died.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.062]  How bad did it feel when your loved one died?
[00:25:48.323 --> 00:25:50.625]  How much did you hurt when your loved one died?
[00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:54.308]  Tell us how much you cried when your... I mean, it's so... it is disgusting!
[00:25:54.869 --> 00:26:00.514]  And they're using this as an excuse to bring them all out again and remind everybody of Oklahoma City.
[00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:03.617]  So, Mr. Fortier is going to be released to his wife and two children.
[00:26:03.658 --> 00:26:05.319]  He's been in jail for 10 years.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.042]  He's obviously paid his dues.
[00:26:08.562 --> 00:26:10.104]  And now he's going to be getting out today.
[00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:19.431]  But just the tragedy though of using these people again from Oklahoma City is so sad when we know who the real, real people were behind the operation.
[00:26:20.228 --> 00:26:22.729]  Okay, I want to move to a couple of other things here.
[00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.692]  There's a listener that is fed up with orange and blue, Dave.
[00:26:27.932 --> 00:26:28.932]  This is dedicated to you.
[00:26:29.192 --> 00:26:30.053]  Fed up with orange and blue.
[00:26:30.073 --> 00:26:41.898]  And by the way, we have authenticated this quote from George Bush, which at the bottom of the hour, have your tape players going, you are not going to believe this man is representing you.
[00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:45.600]  She handed this to me just as we were going on the air, about 30 seconds.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.241]  I started reading this and this was crazy.
[00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:48.842]  You are not going to believe it.
[00:26:48.882 --> 00:26:50.904]  Now let me get to this letter from a listener.
[00:26:51.504 --> 00:26:56.768]  And Mike in York, PA is not happy about the orange and blue issue.
[00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:57.428]  Listen to this.
[00:26:57.668 --> 00:27:00.110]  And I will tell you it's getting worse every single day.
[00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:08.296]  Hi Joyce and Dave, just wanted to drop you a line and comment on the ridiculous amount of orange and blue creeping into every last show and TV commercial.
[00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:13.306]  The use of colorization to existing commercials continues.
[00:27:13.727 --> 00:27:14.969]  You go, boy!
[00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.554]  Mike and I are on the same wavelength.
[00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:19.537]  I found me a buddy out there.
[00:27:19.898 --> 00:27:22.823]  I found somebody who can see what's going on.
[00:27:23.422 --> 00:27:40.437]  He says, the colorization continues and it seems the idiots making these commercials can't have even a single scene without the ugly orange, and this includes a more subdued but equally obvious red-orange, there you go right there Dave, I've been telling you about the red-orange, in it somewhere.
[00:27:41.018 --> 00:27:43.720]  It's driving me crazy, you and me Mike.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.261]  It's working on us, isn't it?
[00:27:45.682 --> 00:27:50.226]  Also the extensive use of those subtle blue filters on commercials too.
[00:27:50.945 --> 00:27:55.509]  And Dave always says, oh, that's because the cameramen are outside and they use a blue filter.
[00:27:55.529 --> 00:27:55.569]  No!
[00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.991]  It's intentional.
[00:27:57.591 --> 00:27:59.033]  Like the Volvo commercials.
[00:27:59.133 --> 00:28:02.496]  Notice the faint blue cast the cars take.
[00:28:02.936 --> 00:28:06.940]  Every single car on TV that's being sold this year is either blue or orange.
[00:28:07.701 --> 00:28:08.782]  It's the filter.
[00:28:09.508 --> 00:28:10.949]  I want to say it's a filter, stupid.
[00:28:11.229 --> 00:28:15.953]  How about commercials where every dolt is walking around in a blue or orange shirt?
[00:28:16.293 --> 00:28:22.658]  Now, I went downtown for sales yesterday, and I didn't see anybody walking around together in blue and orange.
[00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.472]  Well, but you do on TV every place.
[00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:34.720]  The Sprint commercial has been switched over as well as Office Max logo, which used to be red for those who have more than two memory cells in their brains.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.001]  Oh, I like this guy, Mike.
[00:28:36.202 --> 00:28:36.922]  I like him.
[00:28:37.543 --> 00:28:39.525]  I noticed the color switch on the sitcoms, too.
[00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:42.427]  Like Everyone Loves Raymond, they wear bright orange T-shirts.
[00:28:42.748 --> 00:28:44.229]  Well, the ultimate slap in the face
[00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:49.776]  For lots of folks, should have been the group picture on CNN with the new Supreme Court Justices.
[00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:52.380]  Now see, this guy knows what's going on.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.761]  The newbie was there.
[00:28:54.062 --> 00:28:55.524]  The new, newbie guy.
[00:28:56.185 --> 00:28:57.787]  Grinning like an idiot!
[00:28:58.413 --> 00:29:06.754]  With a bright orange necktie under the robe and the worst one was the older guys in the front with bright orange bow ties on.
[00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:09.475]  The guys looked like freaking clowns.
[00:29:10.755 --> 00:29:14.596]  Maybe you could mention this gradual switch and find someone who can explain this stupid trend.
[00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:20.557]  Not only will I mention it, I am going to hit it home every single day until people see they're being used.
[00:29:21.077 --> 00:29:22.557]  Is it something occult related?
[00:29:22.817 --> 00:29:23.257]  Who knows?
[00:29:23.317 --> 00:29:26.538]  But it seems the masses are blind and I'm getting sick of it everywhere.
[00:29:27.139 --> 00:29:28.000]  Sorry for the ramming.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.421]  No, I'm not, Mike.
[00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.341]  I love it.
[00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:31.322]  Take care.
[00:29:31.642 --> 00:29:32.202]  Never stop.
[00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:33.543]  You guys are doing a great job.
[00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:36.345]  And by the way, he says... Oh, there's one more thing we've got to check out.
[00:29:37.086 --> 00:29:37.946]  One more thing he says.
[00:29:38.046 --> 00:29:40.148]  One more idiot area.
[00:29:40.628 --> 00:29:41.448]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:41.989]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:50.675]  Three minute break.

[00:32:01.829 --> 00:32:04.191]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:04.431 --> 00:32:06.452]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:06.612 --> 00:32:13.656]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:13.937 --> 00:32:22.522]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:32:56.686 --> 00:32:59.908]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.991]  Okay, this is a song about symbolism and color.
[00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:07.652]  Yeah.
[00:33:10.547 --> 00:33:14.429]  It has to be blue.
[00:33:14.469 --> 00:33:16.651]  It has to be blue.
[00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:25.016]  You're asking me why, when choosing my tie, what colors I do.
[00:33:25.896 --> 00:33:27.797]  What color to win?
[00:33:29.793 --> 00:33:32.335]  What color to spin?
[00:33:34.076 --> 00:33:39.440]  According to dad, bright colors are bad and motivation is sin.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:48.386]  A subliminal tool to keep you all fooled.
[00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:49.727]  Not the power hour.
[00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:55.231]  Emblem you see a lot on TV and in public school.
[00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.291]  The U.N.
[00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:00.894]  is there, and soon is the hour.
[00:34:01.094 --> 00:34:01.735]  The U.S.
[00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:04.818]  will collapse, and we'll give them the power.
[00:34:05.298 --> 00:34:10.263]  And when we're all through, the color we'll do, will be U.N.
[00:34:10.303 --> 00:34:11.825]  blue.
[00:34:12.145 --> 00:34:13.086]  Yeah!
[00:34:15.248 --> 00:34:15.669]  I want you
[00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.352]  To get up now.
[00:34:18.692 --> 00:34:22.076]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:34:22.096 --> 00:34:32.526]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:33.007]  Yes!
[00:34:33.647 --> 00:34:35.049]  I want you to get up right now.
[00:34:35.789 --> 00:34:43.533]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[00:34:43.613 --> 00:34:46.034]  Things have got to stay in the front, you've got to get back!
[00:34:51.042 --> 00:34:53.283]  Yeah, it's here and it's there.
[00:34:53.363 --> 00:34:54.864]  Just look anywhere.
[00:34:55.544 --> 00:34:57.985]  It's not hard to do.
[00:34:58.925 --> 00:35:02.566]  And when they come to town, you won't really care.
[00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:06.347]  You'll be used to their blue, cause it was everywhere.
[00:35:06.627 --> 00:35:10.289]  So my tribe that's blue, sends a message to you.
[00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:11.709]  The U.N.
[00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:13.470]  is blue!
[00:35:19.725 --> 00:35:20.746]  Whoa!
[00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:20.806]  Oh!
[00:35:21.806 --> 00:35:22.786]  Oh, that is good.
[00:35:22.826 --> 00:35:23.346]  That is good.
[00:35:23.386 --> 00:35:32.389]  Well, listeners, I do believe the new colors of the United States or of the world, you know, whatever they choose to have, it's going to be light blue and orange.
[00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:36.150]  And I think we're sick and tired of seeing this rammed down our throats.
[00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:40.811]  It's a message to all of the elite out there that they are making their mark.
[00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:42.812]  Let me tell you one last thing from Mike and PA.
[00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:43.872]  Love this guy.
[00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:47.793]  By the way, he said, check out MSN.com main page this morning.
[00:35:48.274 --> 00:35:49.074]  It's there too.
[00:35:49.194 --> 00:35:54.796]  Look in the center of the page at the two idiots drinking beer with a deer in the headlights look.
[00:35:55.336 --> 00:35:59.858]  The picture is captioned, Best Super Bowl Bars in 25 Cities.
[00:36:00.338 --> 00:36:02.499]  You may have to hit the back or next arrows.
[00:36:02.921 --> 00:36:05.802]  On the ever-changing little screen box, but it's there.
[00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:08.982]  The two guys in orange and blue.
[00:36:09.183 --> 00:36:09.703]  Oh, man.
[00:36:09.783 --> 00:36:12.183]  Okay, well, anyway, welcome back to the Friday edition.
[00:36:12.223 --> 00:36:13.364]  This is Dave von Kleist.
[00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:14.164]  And Joyce Riley.
[00:36:14.284 --> 00:36:15.164]  Okay, okay.
[00:36:15.824 --> 00:36:17.164]  I can't help it, folks.
[00:36:17.244 --> 00:36:18.285]  Just bear with me.
[00:36:18.485 --> 00:36:19.965]  I just, I got this handed to me.
[00:36:19.985 --> 00:36:20.545]  This is too good.
[00:36:20.705 --> 00:36:23.346]  If this man is really leading this country,
[00:36:23.966 --> 00:36:25.648]  Well, this is the worst.
[00:36:25.728 --> 00:36:26.909]  I have to set the table here.
[00:36:26.949 --> 00:36:32.775]  Now, first of all, I want to thank Shirley up there in Kansas City, listening in on KCXL AM 1140 up there.
[00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:35.758]  She sent me a new calendar of Bushisms.
[00:36:35.978 --> 00:36:37.219]  Yes, thank you, Shirley.
[00:36:37.259 --> 00:36:38.020]  Thank you so much.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:43.245]  But I tell you, I have to step outside of that, because there are so many that he's said this past year.
[00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:44.686]  I've got to share with you a couple.
[00:36:44.726 --> 00:36:48.230]  Then I've got the big, bad blooper of all time here.
[00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:49.651]  Listen to this one.
[00:36:49.691 --> 00:36:55.435]  He said, he said, I think younger workers, first of all, younger workers have been promised benefits.
[00:36:55.495 --> 00:36:58.918]  The government promises that have been promised benefits we can't keep.
[00:36:59.338 --> 00:37:00.339]  That's just the way it is.
[00:37:00.359 --> 00:37:02.140]  I mean, can you?
[00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:05.543]  There's so much confusion here.
[00:37:06.003 --> 00:37:07.805]  Alright, I'll skip on it.
[00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:11.167]  She wants to do the news and I want to get to this thing here, but that's okay.
[00:37:11.187 --> 00:37:11.588]  Here we go.
[00:37:12.368 --> 00:37:15.671]  He said, last year, here we go.
[00:37:16.405 --> 00:37:21.449]  Because all which is on the table begins to address the big cost drivers.
[00:37:21.769 --> 00:37:23.931]  For example, how benefits are calculated.
[00:37:24.231 --> 00:37:25.772]  For example, it is on the table.
[00:37:26.132 --> 00:37:30.315]  Whether or not benefits raised upon wage increases or price increases.
[00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:34.298]  There's a series of parts of the formula that are being considered.
[00:37:34.618 --> 00:37:43.605]  And when you couple that, those different cost drivers affecting those, changing with personal accounts, the idea is to get what has been promised or more likely to be
[00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:46.723]  Or closer delivered to that has been promised.
[00:37:48.164 --> 00:37:49.425]  Does that make any sense to you?
[00:37:49.965 --> 00:37:50.586]  It's kind of muddled.
[00:37:51.807 --> 00:37:52.347]  Look, look, look.
[00:37:53.288 --> 00:38:01.614]  There's a series of things that can be, like, for example, benefits are calculated based upon the increase of wages as opposed to the increase of prices.
[00:38:02.435 --> 00:38:07.539]  Some have suggested that we calculate the benefits will rise based upon inflation
[00:38:08.257 --> 00:38:10.199]  Supposed to wage increases.
[00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:14.782]  There's a reform that would help solve the red if we were to put that into effect.
[00:38:15.003 --> 00:38:23.830]  In other words, how fast benefits grow, how fast the promised benefits grow, if that growth is affected, it will help on the red.
[00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:36.060]  And as he looked out into the audience, there was complete silence and every mouth was open and every eye said, blink.
[00:38:37.353 --> 00:38:38.914]  What is he saying?
[00:38:39.434 --> 00:38:40.435]  This is sick.
[00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:41.636]  This is sad.
[00:38:42.116 --> 00:38:45.378]  I mean, and there are people that say, well, George Bush is doing a good job.
[00:38:45.438 --> 00:38:46.298]  I support George Bush.
[00:38:46.358 --> 00:38:48.780]  All these congressmen, what is wrong with them?
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.282]  I'll tell you what, they are bought and paid for, or blackmailed.
[00:38:52.302 --> 00:38:57.985]  They have to be, to be able to say that this man is the, what, he's the best thing that ever happened to this country.
[00:38:58.105 --> 00:39:00.447]  No, he is not, and there's proof of it.
[00:39:01.227 --> 00:39:02.588]  This is stunning.
[00:39:02.648 --> 00:39:03.248]  This is stunning.
[00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:04.749]  And this is consistent.
[00:39:04.769 --> 00:39:05.890]  At least you can give him that.
[00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:13.174]  I mean, in regard to looking at the damage from the hurricane, he said, it's totally wiped out.
[00:39:13.334 --> 00:39:14.115]  It's devastating.
[00:39:14.395 --> 00:39:16.797]  It's got to be doubly devastating from the ground.
[00:39:17.637 --> 00:39:20.179]  And then he said, we look forward to hearing your vision.
[00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:21.539]  What?
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.421]  We look forward to hearing your vision.
[00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:26.883]  He also said, wow, Brazil is big.
[00:39:29.053 --> 00:39:29.374]  I know.
[00:39:29.454 --> 00:39:32.262]  This man is our president?
[00:39:32.363 --> 00:39:33.606]  Oh, he doesn't know anything.
[00:39:33.947 --> 00:39:36.214]  You know, is it any wonder that he says he doesn't like to read?
[00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:39.636]  Okay, let me move on to a couple of other things.
[00:39:39.676 --> 00:39:46.062]  I want to address Super Bowl because this weekend there's going to be a game with the Broncos, Denver Broncos, whose color is orange and blue.
[00:39:46.102 --> 00:39:47.343]  Just thought I'd throw that in.
[00:39:47.744 --> 00:39:50.967]  And I think we need to look at what was in the USA Today.
[00:39:51.027 --> 00:39:52.648]  And I want to thank Leanne for sending this.
[00:39:52.668 --> 00:39:57.432]  Now those of you who don't know what we're talking about with regard to the Super Bowl, because I don't care about the Super Bowl.
[00:39:57.733 --> 00:39:59.894]  I never even pay attention to any TV.
[00:40:00.155 --> 00:40:01.096]  I don't even know how many
[00:40:02.036 --> 00:40:05.579]  Uh, goals it takes to make a, you know, I don't even know, I don't know anything about it.
[00:40:05.619 --> 00:40:06.039]  I don't care.
[00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:07.701]  And I, and I'm giving my disclaimer.
[00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:08.862]  I know nothing about sports.
[00:40:08.982 --> 00:40:21.171]  However, I am interested though, when it comes to our attention, that somebody says that the Pittsburgh Steelers are going to win every game now, including the Super Bowl game itself, and they were not even a wild card at the time.
[00:40:21.738 --> 00:40:24.159]  And that person, Super Bowl Steve, seems to have known that.
[00:40:24.599 --> 00:40:25.660]  Well, listen to this.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.623]  Leanne says that Super Bowl Steve referred to the January 6th issue of USA Today with the sports page ads.
[00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:36.545]  Well, she said, in the January 5th issue of USA Today, I about fell over.
[00:40:37.246 --> 00:40:45.330]  On page 4C, you will see the Texas Bullhorns, and it says, Horns of Plenty.
[00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:49.032]  And also, picture of the helmet with the horns.
[00:40:49.592 --> 00:40:51.373]  On page 5C, it says,
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:56.082]  Watch the world's best players compete for the world's.
[00:40:57.723 --> 00:40:58.103]  Ooh.
[00:40:58.704 --> 00:41:02.586]  On page 7C, Tiger Woods' header says, Changing Course.
[00:41:03.226 --> 00:41:06.868]  And the subtitles read, Ground to make up.
[00:41:08.129 --> 00:41:09.149]  The long drive.
[00:41:09.329 --> 00:41:10.430]  Are we there yet?
[00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.731]  Time to make a move.
[00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:14.412]  The clock is ticking.
[00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:16.193]  And the end of an era.
[00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:23.651]  I didn't know if you'd be interested in hearing about this, but I found it to be very scary.
[00:41:23.751 --> 00:41:26.332]  I think the Super Bowl guy is on to something.
[00:41:26.392 --> 00:41:26.972]  Have a great day.
[00:41:27.253 --> 00:41:28.953]  You two are awesome, Leanne and Missouri.
[00:41:28.993 --> 00:41:30.233]  You are awesome also.
[00:41:30.293 --> 00:41:32.694]  Thank you very, very much for sending that.
[00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:37.956]  And to Len, I want to thank you for sending this.
[00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.777]  Yahoo says, which presidents were left-handed?
[00:41:41.957 --> 00:41:42.897]  Need a helping hand?
[00:41:42.957 --> 00:41:48.219]  Well, a search on left-handers led to the following.
[00:41:49.192 --> 00:41:51.294]  Here's the presidents that were left-handed.
[00:41:51.934 --> 00:42:02.362]  James Garfield, Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Bill Clinton.
[00:42:04.323 --> 00:42:11.429]  We notice that four of the last five commanders-in-chief wrote with their left hand.
[00:42:12.189 --> 00:42:16.132]  This, of course, begs the question, which current presidential candidates are left-handed?
[00:42:16.152 --> 00:42:18.114]  Well, they look down, and this is for the last election.
[00:42:18.757 --> 00:42:21.759]  That Bill Bradley was the only one who was left-handed.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:28.365]  And they found out also that Steve Forbes is left-handed and H. Ross Perot is left-handed.
[00:42:28.425 --> 00:42:29.285]  Is there any meaning to this?
[00:42:29.906 --> 00:42:30.386]  Dunno.
[00:42:31.227 --> 00:42:33.569]  But kind of interesting, I think.
[00:42:35.891 --> 00:42:36.271]  Let's see.
[00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:38.842]  Also, I want to thank Marcus for sending this.
[00:42:38.942 --> 00:42:40.644]  Please pray for rain.
[00:42:40.884 --> 00:42:42.185]  I think this is an excellent idea.
[00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:44.166]  Let's start a prayer chain for rain.
[00:42:44.706 --> 00:42:49.449]  If, when you get this email, you will stop a minute and pray very strongly for rain, I think we can make a difference.
[00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.772]  Just pray for the people who have lost homes and everything they have.
[00:42:53.452 --> 00:42:56.054]  Friends, we need the rain, both here in Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:42:56.454 --> 00:42:58.295]  We are all being affected by it.
[00:42:58.856 --> 00:43:02.198]  Through our faith in God and our prayers, I believe we can succeed.
[00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.534]  A very valid request for prayer.
[00:43:04.654 --> 00:43:06.835]  I hope you will join this effort and pass it on as well.
[00:43:07.476 --> 00:43:15.160]  Also, I think we need to pray for the firefighters, especially the volunteer ones who have worked constantly without pay to try to keep us all safe.
[00:43:17.422 --> 00:43:27.528]  And I have to tell you on the sad side, I have had lots of letters from people wanting help for veterans, people who are involved in fighting for veterans,
[00:43:28.143 --> 00:43:30.145]  And people who are succumbing to the veterans.
[00:43:30.505 --> 00:43:33.548]  I mean, veterans' plights of illness.
[00:43:33.688 --> 00:43:34.569]  And I am so sad.
[00:43:34.669 --> 00:43:40.774]  I don't even know how we are going to respond to all these people that are coming out of the woodworks needing help now.
[00:43:40.914 --> 00:43:42.416]  And there's far too many.
[00:43:42.796 --> 00:43:44.718]  I mean, no one organization can handle it.
[00:43:45.228 --> 00:43:56.853]  And when the government says we can't handle all the PTSD claims and we can't handle all the PTSD issues, well, if the government says that and they've got, you know, blue coups of huge VA hospitals, how are we going to do that?
[00:43:57.174 --> 00:43:58.214]  I don't know.
[00:43:58.234 --> 00:44:04.337]  And I don't want to, you know, I just don't want to read these stories right now because it just makes me
[00:44:05.286 --> 00:44:05.666]  It hurts.
[00:44:05.887 --> 00:44:06.467]  It really does.
[00:44:06.547 --> 00:44:09.529]  But I do, I'm going to get to Doug Rocky and why he's upset.
[00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:12.031]  And he has every reason to be upset for the way he's being treated.
[00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:15.373]  But let me tell you, first of all, Google is now resisting the U.S.
[00:44:15.393 --> 00:44:16.634]  subpoena and search data.
[00:44:17.374 --> 00:44:20.056]  They are saying, nope, Justice Department, you're not going to have it.
[00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:22.238]  Well, let's see how long Google lasts then.
[00:44:22.258 --> 00:44:24.459]  Yeah, this comes out of San Francisco.
[00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:34.046]  As of yesterday, the Justice Department has asked a federal judge to compel Google, the Internet search giant, to turn over records on millions of its users.
[00:44:35.327 --> 00:44:41.350]  Search queries as part of the government's effort to uphold, of course, online pornography law.
[00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:52.615]  Google has been refusing requests since a subpoena was first issued last August, even as three of its competitors agreed to provide information according to court documents made public this week.
[00:44:53.076 --> 00:45:04.081]  Google asserts that the request is unnecessary, overly broad, and would be onerous to comply with, would jeopardize its trade secrets, and could expose identifying information about its users.
[00:45:04.733 --> 00:45:15.156]  The dispute with Google comes as the government is moving aggressively on several fronts to obtain data on Internet activity to achieve its law enforcement goals.
[00:45:15.576 --> 00:45:27.099]  To have their way with you and know every single thing about what you do, who you talk to, where you go on the Internet, what your interests are, what you read at the library.
[00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:29.300]  Are you seeing a trend here?
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.381]  Well, of course Google says we're going to resist.
[00:45:34.059 --> 00:45:36.981]  We'll see how long that lasts.
[00:45:39.243 --> 00:45:41.025]  A cancer treatment in the spice cabinet?
[00:45:41.465 --> 00:45:41.865]  Yes!
[00:45:42.366 --> 00:45:48.731]  A growing body of research suggests the spice turmeric has potent anti-cancer activity.
[00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:51.273]  Now we told you this months and months and months ago.
[00:45:51.313 --> 00:46:01.140]  Power Hour was out there leading the front telling you about turmeric so that you could get your curcumin in advance of the price going up and in advance of there not being any.
[00:46:01.821 --> 00:46:03.162]  And I'll tell you why in just a second.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.001]  But the American Cancer Society is saying this.
[00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:10.102]  This is a news release from the American Cancer Society.
[00:46:11.562 --> 00:46:15.903]  Researchers have now launched a slew of human trials to find out how powerful it may be.
[00:46:16.723 --> 00:46:26.106]  No, they've released a slew of human trials so they can patent it and take it off the market and make it so that only they can have it.
[00:46:26.775 --> 00:46:38.963]  I think the promise is enormous, says Bhagarat Agarwal, PhD, Chief of the Cytokine Research Lab in the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at UTMD Medical Anderson Cancer Center.
[00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:41.324]  That's where Dr. Garth Nicholson was, by the way.
[00:46:42.005 --> 00:46:48.289]  Agarwal has conducted numerous lab and animal studies of turmeric and its primary component curcumin.
[00:46:49.099 --> 00:46:54.864]  And recently gave a lecture on the topic at the Annual Conference of the Society for Integrative Oncology.
[00:46:55.184 --> 00:46:57.887]  We don't come to you with phony false claims.
[00:46:58.227 --> 00:47:00.329]  We come to you with the truth.
[00:47:00.749 --> 00:47:01.450]  And here it is.
[00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.593]  Turmeric, as you know, is a yellow powder
[00:47:05.913 --> 00:47:06.434]  I can tell you
[00:47:23.246 --> 00:47:28.887]  That we gave it to a Power Hour dog who has become a new dog.
[00:47:29.227 --> 00:47:31.988]  This dog had no personality for five years.
[00:47:32.088 --> 00:47:34.908]  We considered mentally challenged.
[00:47:34.948 --> 00:47:37.049]  The dog had no interest in anything.
[00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:38.529]  I mean, we gave it.
[00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.430]  Dave gets a credit for this.
[00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:41.530]  He said, let's try Kirkman.
[00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.370]  Unbelievable results.
[00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.431]  The dog's tail is wagging.
[00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:48.251]  He's always there to greet everybody.
[00:47:48.511 --> 00:47:49.211]  He is happy.
[00:47:49.612 --> 00:47:51.692]  I mean, he's got to be a whole lot happier.
[00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:53.460]  It is amazing.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.801]  It is just amazing.
[00:47:55.142 --> 00:48:02.429]  Well the idea is to try turmeric against cancer developed as researchers learned about the role that inflammation plays in cancer.
[00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.373]  Turmeric and curcumin are anti-inflammatory.
[00:48:06.854 --> 00:48:10.938]  That has been described in traditional medicine like Ayurveda for thousands of years.
[00:48:11.735 --> 00:48:15.216]  But Ayurveda, of course, was not tested.
[00:48:15.236 --> 00:48:17.197]  It only worked for thousands of years.
[00:48:17.237 --> 00:48:18.778]  That's the only test that it had.
[00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:22.239]  Well, lab and animal studies now show effect on many cancers.
[00:48:22.639 --> 00:48:30.082]  The early lab research that Agarwal and others have done focuses on curcumin, the most active compound in turmeric.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.061]  The studies show that curcumin can indeed slow inflammation.
[00:48:34.581 --> 00:48:51.005]  It also appears to slow the spread of cancer and metastasis, slows down the growth of new tumor blood vessels, which is called angiogenesis, and causes cancer cells to die the way normal cells do, which is apoptosis.
[00:48:51.645 --> 00:48:55.686]  What's more, these effects don't appear to be limited to just one type of cancer.
[00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:59.607]  Curcumin has shown effects in lab studies against metastatic melanoma,
[00:49:00.262 --> 00:49:00.542]  Am I taking it?
[00:49:00.562 --> 00:49:00.702]  You bet!
[00:49:00.722 --> 00:49:01.503]  Is Dave taking it?
[00:49:01.523 --> 00:49:01.803]  You bet!
[00:49:26.215 --> 00:49:29.216]  However, not all research on curcumin has had such positive results.
[00:49:29.576 --> 00:49:36.858]  At least one study, we need to be honest with you, suggests that curcumin may inhibit the action of some chemotherapy drugs.
[00:49:38.598 --> 00:49:44.320]  So just, you need to know that if you're on chemotherapy, don't take, I wouldn't take it, personally, curcumin.
[00:49:44.818 --> 00:49:52.126]  At MD Anderson alone, Agaral said that doctors are testing curcumin in multiple myeloma and advanced pancreatic cancer.
[00:49:52.626 --> 00:49:56.610]  The institution is also seeking the funding for a study of curcumin in women with breast cancer.
[00:49:57.071 --> 00:50:07.301]  So let me just add, if you're thinking about taking it, you need to get the type, or it's being advised now by many physicians, to get the type that has peperine.
[00:50:07.782 --> 00:50:13.526]  Piperine is an additive that really, really complements it and makes it work a lot stronger.
[00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:15.147]  We have it at the Power Hour.
[00:50:15.207 --> 00:50:21.212]  We got it eight months ago, about eight months, six or eight months ago, when I heard this study was going to come out.
[00:50:21.732 --> 00:50:23.513]  This was published January 2nd.
[00:50:23.933 --> 00:50:26.976]  All I can say is, listeners, beware.
[00:50:27.396 --> 00:50:28.557]  Get it while you can.
[00:50:28.797 --> 00:50:31.039]  Now, here is one very positive thing.
[00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:37.223]  For those of you that are vets, we've had some Curcumin donated and some Serazine donated by Robert.
[00:50:38.303 --> 00:50:39.043]  From the UK.
[00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:52.031]  And if you're a vet, if you want to try Curcumin and Serozyme, then you write us a letter, and you send us some kind of proof that you're in the military, and tell us your situation, why you need the Curcumin.
[00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:53.052]  Guess what?
[00:50:53.772 --> 00:50:54.652]  No charge, Bess.
[00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:56.954]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[00:50:57.434 --> 00:50:57.654]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:50:57.674 --> 00:50:58.054]  Three minutes.
[00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:08.273]  People who use supplements are learning more about herbs and their effectiveness, and so are the people who do the research and make the supplements.
[00:51:08.594 --> 00:51:13.616]  Turmeric has been long known to be a balancing and detoxifying herb, and curcumin is the active part of turmeric.
[00:51:13.936 --> 00:51:27.442]  Curcumin 98 is 98% curcumin, and ongoing studies are showing that curcumin is helping people who suffer from acne, allergies, autoimmune disorders, burns, chicken pox, diabetes, liver damage, rashes, tumors, ulcers, eye problems, multiple sclerosis, and more.
[00:51:27.742 --> 00:51:32.045]  Testimonies are rolling in from folks who have tried Curcumin, and the results are some of the best we've ever seen.
[00:51:32.326 --> 00:51:39.931]  There are 500 milligrams of Curcumin in each of the 200 capsules, and each capsule also contains Bioprin, which doubles the effectiveness of the Curcumin, and each jar is only $34.95.
[00:51:39.991 --> 00:51:40.211]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:40.432]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:51:40.452 --> 00:51:45.375]  Curcumin 98 is getting rave reviews across the board, and you just may add your voice to those who are singing the praises of Curcumin 98!
[00:51:53.021 --> 00:51:54.581]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:51:54.781 --> 00:51:59.863]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Kirkman 98 today.
[00:52:01.323 --> 00:52:02.423]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:52:02.763 --> 00:52:04.564]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:52:04.584 --> 00:52:06.084]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:52:06.184 --> 00:52:06.484]  Yes.
[00:52:06.785 --> 00:52:07.625]  You neglect me.
[00:52:07.805 --> 00:52:09.765]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:52:11.606 --> 00:52:12.606]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:52:12.966 --> 00:52:13.826]  I'm getting sick.
[00:52:14.146 --> 00:52:16.307]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:52:17.388 --> 00:52:17.868]  Wait a minute.
[00:52:17.948 --> 00:52:19.550]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:28.377]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:52:28.838 --> 00:52:34.303]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:52:34.543 --> 00:52:36.925]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:52:37.065 --> 00:52:41.729]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:52:41.949 --> 00:52:43.611]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:47.134]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:08.762]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:53:08.922 --> 00:53:21.825]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:53:22.025 --> 00:53:23.805]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:53:23.985 --> 00:53:27.447]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:53:27.727 --> 00:53:31.510]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:36.753]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:53:38.974 --> 00:53:42.957]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[00:53:56.501 --> 00:53:57.101]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:59.581]  They sell us the president the same way.
[00:53:59.601 --> 00:54:05.423]  They sell us our clothes and our cars.
[00:54:09.987 --> 00:54:12.748]  They tell us everything from youth to religion.
[00:54:12.768 --> 00:54:15.908]  At the same time they sell us our war.
[00:54:16.689 --> 00:54:19.449]  I want to know who the men in the shadows are.
[00:54:19.469 --> 00:54:22.990]  I want to hear somebody asking them why.
[00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:26.991]  They can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are.
[00:54:27.251 --> 00:54:30.452]  But they're never the ones to fight or to die.
[00:54:30.612 --> 00:54:32.432]  And there are lies in the balance.
[00:54:32.612 --> 00:54:36.376]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday morning edition of The Power Hour.
[00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:51.771]  We're coming up on 55 minutes past the hour, and a quick reminder for those of you that are listening on the international shortwave, if you're dialed into WHRI 7.520, you'll have to change your receiver in about four minutes to 11.785 for the second and third hours of the broadcast.
[00:54:52.211 --> 00:54:56.052]  Such is the case with the listeners on WWCR 5.765.
[00:54:56.092 --> 00:55:01.133]  We'll also change in a few minutes to 7.465 for the remainder of the program.
[00:55:01.454 --> 00:55:04.354]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll be talking with Don Markham.
[00:55:04.674 --> 00:55:13.037]  He has an article that's been published in the Idaho Observer, and it's an analysis of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
[00:55:14.637 --> 00:55:21.600]  And it's a rather important piece of legislation that just sort of got shoved right through, and there are ramifications.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.401]  We'll be talking about that in the next hour.
[00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:25.422]  This is Dave Van Kwist.
[00:55:25.462 --> 00:55:26.022]  And Joyce Riley.
[00:55:26.042 --> 00:55:26.662]  Let me tell you why.
[00:55:26.702 --> 00:55:30.083]  Tom Cahill is the Power Hour team member of the day.
[00:55:30.544 --> 00:55:35.226]  Tom Cahill has written a lot of very good things on the internet, and we've posted some of his stories.
[00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:41.188]  But he also has guts, and he also is putting his actions behind his message.
[00:55:41.667 --> 00:55:56.694]  He went to a news conference or a meeting, town hall meeting of Congressman Thompson, Mike Thompson of North Carolina, and where the Fort Bragg Advocate News carried this story.
[00:55:57.194 --> 00:56:06.999]  I think it's important to understand here that there are people that are willing to go up and make a stand and not afraid of, oh my gosh, what will they say?
[00:56:07.559 --> 00:56:08.460]  Well, listen to this.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.380]  Thompson believes
[00:56:10.083 --> 00:56:14.325]  Well, he's talking about refocus the priorities of the American people.
[00:56:14.686 --> 00:56:26.772]  Thompson presented his plan for Iraqi withdrawal, saying that Congress should pledge never to build military bases and promise publicly that Iraqi oil will be the property of the Iraqi people.
[00:56:27.293 --> 00:56:37.158]  Well, Thompson believes those actions would slow the number of volunteers coming from around the Middle East to help the Iraq insurgency and slow the aggressive troop exit, which will begin this summer.
[00:56:37.768 --> 00:56:50.093]  Tom Cahill, you go boy, of Fort Bragg, a member of the Veterans for Peace, presented Thompson a copy of the film Beyond Treason by the Gulf War Veterans Association.
[00:56:50.653 --> 00:57:00.577]  He challenged Thompson to investigate whether the deaths of 10,000 to 15,000 Gulf War veterans in 1991 was related to the military's use of depleted uranium.
[00:57:01.737 --> 00:57:05.719]  Thompson said he has co-sponsored a bill related to the DU investigation.
[00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:13.715]  Cahill spotted a tiny pin on Thompson's lapel and interrupted the congressman saying, is that a combat infantryman's pin?
[00:57:16.236 --> 00:57:19.638]  Thompson's response was, I never leave home without it.
[00:57:20.299 --> 00:57:21.920]  Thompson served in combat with the U.S.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:28.723]  Army as a Staff Sergeant Platoon Leader in the 173rd Airborne Brigade where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart.
[00:57:29.404 --> 00:57:31.745]  Nothing ever enraged Thompson as much as the right
[00:57:32.443 --> 00:57:41.888]  As the right-wing talk show host and the Republican National Committee when they called him a traitor for his pre-war investigation and his pre-war investigatory trip to Iraq.
[00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:48.292]  Anyway, I just want to say thank you, kudos, you go boy, yeah, we're going to be talking to Congressman Thompson.
[00:57:48.852 --> 00:57:51.814]  Now, Doug Rocky is furious.
[00:57:52.115 --> 00:57:54.116]  He has been attacked over and over again.
[00:57:54.657 --> 00:57:57.679]  If you go to the internet, you will see where they're attacking the messenger.
[00:57:58.079 --> 00:58:01.141]  And his comment is, he said, Joyce, I am sending this out.
[00:58:01.222 --> 00:58:05.164]  I am sick and tired of the shoot the messenger campaign on me.
[00:58:05.585 --> 00:58:14.351]  While they ignore AR 700-48, which is the army regulation that says they must wear respirators, suits, and clean up their mess.
[00:58:15.112 --> 00:58:15.833]  And TB9,
[00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:18.042]  I'm not going to go into that.
[00:58:18.342 --> 00:58:26.846]  And all the orders, and ignore my actual duties, accomplishments, as if they're attacking me, they do not have to comply with the regulations.
[00:58:27.086 --> 00:58:27.966]  He's absolutely right.
[00:58:27.986 --> 00:58:36.010]  I'm going to come back and talk to you about this, because a guy named Dan Fahey, who says he's an expert, has tried to bring down Doug Rocky.
[00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:38.651]  We'll be right back after this one minute, ten second break.
[00:58:53.819 --> 00:58:59.863]  I'm here to follow my orders and stop this madman Hussein.
[00:59:01.824 --> 00:59:07.527]  They tell me he'll use germ warfare and anyone who would must be completely insane.
[00:59:09.668 --> 00:59:15.011]  While the flyboys run sorties, I'm putting on protective clothing from head to toe.
[00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:22.498]  My Uncle Sam will protect me, because we stand for truth and honor, that's what I know.
[00:59:26.385 --> 00:59:27.626]  That's what so many believe.
[00:59:27.686 --> 00:59:31.268]  Welcome back to the Friday edition of the Power Hour.
[00:59:31.328 --> 00:59:32.209]  This is Dave Van Clyste.
[00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.969]  Enjoy Friday.
[00:59:33.009 --> 00:59:35.491]  I'm going to get right to these statements of Dr. Doug Rocky.
[00:59:35.551 --> 00:59:36.651]  He is upset.
[00:59:36.872 --> 00:59:39.733]  He is very upset with very good reason.
[00:59:40.234 --> 00:59:48.759]  He says to Dan Fahey, who is the gentleman who has been creating the stir over, a part of the stir over Doug's credentials,
[00:59:49.259 --> 00:59:52.681]  As you all know, Doug Rockey stars in Beyond Treason.
[00:59:52.721 --> 01:00:01.984]  He stars in it because he was the chief whistleblower from the Department of Defense who was lighting a fire under the butt of the Department of Defense to get them to do something to take care of Gulf War veterans.
[01:00:02.264 --> 01:00:04.906]  Well, their only response is, well, Doug's not credible.
[01:00:05.306 --> 01:00:09.467]  It's not whether they're sick or not, it's just a repeat of everything for the past 50 years.
[01:00:09.888 --> 01:00:18.151]  He says, Dr. Doug Rockey says, Dan, your continued public comments without any actual experience in any aspect of our work from Gulf War I until the present
[01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:30.816]  And your claim that you have promoted training and medical care since 1993 seems strange since you never mentioned in your recent public statements that I, Doug Rocky, was the U.S.
[01:00:30.897 --> 01:00:34.439]  Army Health Physicist and Team Medic on the 3rd U.S.
[01:00:34.619 --> 01:00:47.727]  Army DU Team during the Gulf War I, who established the need for and initial still-ignored medical care protocols and cleaned up the mess to include on-site casualty medical care while you were never involved.
[01:00:48.294 --> 01:00:53.517]  Number two, that I and my team members wrote the after-action reports and that you were never involved.
[01:00:53.798 --> 01:00:55.639]  Number three, that I was the U.S.
[01:00:55.679 --> 01:01:04.724]  Army Depleted Uranium Project Director who did the research at the Nevada test site, wrote the training and education programs, and was a primary author of the U.S.
[01:01:04.764 --> 01:01:09.207]  Army Regulation 700-48 and the D.U.C.T.T.
[01:01:09.327 --> 01:01:11.008]  while you were never involved.
[01:01:11.429 --> 01:01:16.552]  Number four, that my primary efforts have always been to ensure that DOD officials
[01:01:17.051 --> 01:01:20.352]  Comply with all provisions of the U.S.
[01:01:20.392 --> 01:01:33.835]  Army Regulations 700-48 and all the numerous but ignored orders that mandate medical care through environmental remediation while you do not even mention these documents or but ignored legal requirements.
[01:01:34.415 --> 01:01:37.676]  Number five, that you have absolutely no primary experience
[01:01:38.297 --> 01:01:48.803]  Working with me or my team to base your comments upon because you do not know what we saw, learned, verified during research and on-site operations or what has happened to our health.
[01:01:49.403 --> 01:02:00.209]  Your comment that no one who died who lived in central Illinois is an insult to the widow, his family and all of us who know who were his friends.
[01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:06.112]  You did not know the person and had absolutely no knowledge of his military activities since you were never involved.
[01:02:06.593 --> 01:02:07.133]  That you wrote
[01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:15.465]  His definitive claim that any military personnel that has been near the contamination will bring it back is laughable.
[01:02:15.886 --> 01:02:25.356]  Anyway, he goes on and says the 700-48 that I wrote and whose compliance is mandatory as ordered by General Eric Shinseki.
[01:02:25.956 --> 01:02:29.280]  Maybe you would like to tell the medical personnel who treated contaminated casualties
[01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:35.095]  We're going to have him on next week and it's time that I think we address the issue with the Department of Defense.
[01:02:35.115 --> 01:02:36.997]  They are continuing to browbeat him.
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.754]  It has been horrible since Beyond Treason came out.
[01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:54.517]  The treatment that he has obtained.
[01:02:54.877 --> 01:02:56.099]  This is disgusting.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:03.711]  You have somebody who is trying their very, very best with their last breath to tell the truth about depleted uranium and all he gets
[01:03:04.224 --> 01:03:07.307]  Is this an absolute character assassination?
[01:03:07.547 --> 01:03:16.754]  You know, I'd like to address all the folks that are paid to listen to this broadcast and somehow subscribe to the philosophy and the methodology that you have to shoot the messenger because you don't want to face the message.
[01:03:17.114 --> 01:03:27.863]  Keep in mind that the efforts of people like Major Doug Rocky, Dr. Doug Rocky, the efforts that he is making are there to protect you
[01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:41.349]  And if you participate in the demonization or ridicule or discrediting of this person, you're only shooting yourself in the foot and possibly affecting your children and the children yet to be born into your family.
[01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:46.870]  I mean, you've got to go look in the mirror and figure out who the bad guys really are, because it's not us and it's not Doug.
[01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.451]  We'll be right back after this three-minute break.
[01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:49.731]  Stay tuned.
[01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:58.197]  This is Joyce Riley, and most of you know I've searched for over five years to find something to help the vets.
[01:03:58.537 --> 01:04:00.419]  Well, I found something that will help everybody.
[01:04:00.819 --> 01:04:06.605]  Miracle-2's soap, neutralizer, gel, and skin moisturizer have prompted testimonies from people all over the country.
[01:04:07.086 --> 01:04:11.610]  Around the house, it's gentle enough to wash your hair, strong enough for your toughest jobs.

[01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:21.341]  We've all heard news stories about products that cause cancer, birth defects, or other health problems.
[01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:26.365]  Well, many people who have used Miracle-2 products have stated that they have literally washed their problems away.
[01:04:27.045 --> 01:04:29.427]  The folks from Miracle-2 don't have to make these claims.
[01:04:29.707 --> 01:04:31.288]  Their customers do it for them.
[01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:35.652]  Try Miracle-2 and you just might find yourself working miracles in your home.

[01:04:45.683 --> 01:04:45.924]  Call 877-485-3838.
[01:04:46.024 --> 01:04:46.807]  Miracle 2 isn't just soap.
[01:04:46.827 --> 01:04:47.389]  It's a miracle!
[01:04:54.647 --> 01:04:57.309]  Hi, I'm Bobby Likus with today's Car Clinic Minute.
[01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:59.972]  Sit down, strap in and take off.
[01:05:00.392 --> 01:05:06.318]  No, you're not heading to the moon, but your trip just around the block could be just as wild a ride.
[01:05:06.498 --> 01:05:10.381]  When we come back, I'll tell you how to latch your kids in safely.
[01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:14.625]  Bobby Likus here with Car Killer number 7 on my 10 Most Wanted list.
[01:05:15.106 --> 01:05:16.727]  What causes your engine to overheat?
[01:05:17.148 --> 01:05:19.630]  Usually it's corrosion and buildup in the cooling system.
[01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:27.339]  A BG Cooling System Service flushes that murky, discolored fluid, replacing it with premium coolant and conditioner.
[01:05:27.679 --> 01:05:29.561]  And it comes with a free protection plan.
[01:05:30.002 --> 01:05:38.192]  Remember, not all scheduled maintenance is the same, so go to BGFindAShop.com to find a BG Cooling System Service now.
[01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:43.248]  Forget outer space!
[01:05:43.748 --> 01:05:51.030]  Experts believe that 80 to 90 percent of child safety seats right here on Earth are installed and are used incorrectly.
[01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:58.011]  The key to preventing young children from experiencing zero gravity by being thrown from their safety seats is LATCH.
[01:05:58.491 --> 01:05:59.832]  L-A-T-C-H.
[01:06:00.052 --> 01:06:03.432]  Which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children.
[01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:11.594]  LATCH bypasses a vehicle's seat belt system by using anchors found between the vehicle's back seat cushions to securely fasten child safety seats.
[01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:16.345]  Both vehicle and safety seat must be latch compatible for the system to work.
[01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.310]  So check closely before blast off.
[01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:19.613]  I'm Bobby Likus.
[01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:21.116]  Likus, you'll love us!
[01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:26.491]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[01:06:26.671 --> 01:06:30.551]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:34.232]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[01:06:34.612 --> 01:06:42.193]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[01:06:42.473 --> 01:06:45.754]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[01:06:46.174 --> 01:06:49.815]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[01:06:50.075 --> 01:06:51.535]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[01:07:01.065 --> 01:07:05.148]  Hi everybody, this is Davon Kleist and Joyce Riley, and we all know knowledge is power.
[01:07:05.348 --> 01:07:07.950]  Of course, that's why we call this the Power Hour!
[01:07:18.112 --> 01:07:29.696]  The opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of the staff, management, sponsors of this radio station, Citibank, AmeriCard, and... all of the other... MasterCard?
[01:07:29.896 --> 01:07:30.656]  Visa?
[01:07:31.116 --> 01:07:31.657]  I don't know!
[01:07:32.997 --> 01:07:38.299]  Anyone who's involved with high finance and banking might have a problem with today's broadcast.
[01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:41.656]  And, uh, why, you might ask?
[01:07:41.716 --> 01:07:43.078]  Well, I'm going to find out as well.
[01:07:43.138 --> 01:07:44.419]  I have to tell you right off the bat.
[01:07:44.439 --> 01:07:49.185]  Well, first of all, welcome to the hour number two of today's Friday installment of the Power Hour.
[01:07:49.205 --> 01:07:51.107]  This is Dave Von Kleist and Joyce Riley.
[01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:55.613]  And, uh, we're going to be talking this hour with, um, with Mark, um, sorry,
[01:07:56.253 --> 01:07:57.414]  With Don Markham.
[01:07:58.115 --> 01:08:07.203]  And Don has written a very important analysis of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
[01:08:07.623 --> 01:08:09.725]  He's been a paralegal for the past eight years.
[01:08:10.426 --> 01:08:20.394]  He took it upon himself to learn about the banking industry and about the legality behind it because he could recognize that there was something really rotten in Denmark, as they say.
[01:08:20.674 --> 01:08:24.538]  He's got his Bachelor of Science in History and in Political Science.
[01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:38.022]  His graduate studies included oriental military history, and he's just an all-around inquisitive kind of guy that likes opening up cans of worms and see which way they crawl.
[01:08:38.883 --> 01:08:45.045]  Apparently he's done exactly that with this analysis, which is published, as I understand, in the Idaho Observer.
[01:08:45.665 --> 01:08:48.606]  Anyway, welcome to the broadcast, Don Markham.
[01:08:50.314 --> 01:09:04.107]  I'm doing just fine, and you're going to have to have a little patience with me, because when it comes to high finance, bonds, stocks, investments, banking, all that type of stuff, that's not one of my strong areas.
[01:09:04.567 --> 01:09:12.635]  Now, a lot of folks do understand the concept of bankruptcy, and they do understand that, hey, well, with the economy being what it is,
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:21.065]  There are a lot of folks that are falling into bankruptcy, or the threat of them falling into bankruptcy is looming large on the horizon.
[01:09:21.385 --> 01:09:34.152]  So if you could just give a little bit of a background as to what bankruptcy has been, why we had bankruptcy laws in place for so many years, and then we can get into how this new legislation is going to affect all of that.
[01:09:34.172 --> 01:09:38.515]  Okay, I'm going to back up just a tad here and go into a
[01:09:39.159 --> 01:09:41.580]  Uh, finance before we get into bankruptcy.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.222]  Okay, let me ask you right off the bat, are you on a cell phone?
[01:09:44.622 --> 01:09:47.403]  I'm on a... There, I can pick up the other one.
[01:09:47.503 --> 01:09:47.743]  Hold on.
[01:09:48.024 --> 01:09:52.086]  Yeah, that would be good, because there's a very strange sound happening.
[01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:52.826]  Okay, is that better?
[01:09:53.186 --> 01:09:54.047]  That sounds better, yeah.
[01:09:54.427 --> 01:10:08.674]  Okay, now, uh, everybody out there usually at some point in their life will go out and sign contracts, get involved in buying a house, a car, and basically involved in getting in debt.
[01:10:09.734 --> 01:10:14.195]  And as long as everybody pays their debts, life is rosy.
[01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:22.697]  It's only when things arrive or happen that may cause you to get in financial difficulty.
[01:10:23.497 --> 01:10:27.278]  That's when things become a disaster.
[01:10:28.259 --> 01:10:33.600]  And now, for over 200 years, our country has had bankruptcy
[01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:48.000]  Laws on the books in fact is to find the constitution that we should have bankruptcy and it's basically to grant people relief when they got themselves in certain situations which were beyond their control.
[01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:58.828]  And that's been fairly well defined through federal law, which the bankruptcy code is found in Title 11 of the U.S.
[01:10:58.908 --> 01:10:59.188]  Code.
[01:11:02.603 --> 01:11:26.830]  Starting about eight years ago, maybe nine years ago, this is during the Clinton administration, the financial institutions, credit cards, banking, mortgage companies, HMO, hospitals, started pushing our legislators in Congress to revamp the bankruptcy code.
[01:11:28.031 --> 01:11:30.511]  And originally, in 2001, they did pass
[01:11:32.972 --> 01:11:40.075]  Two versions that weren't agreed upon, and they had a conference, which is where they iron out the differences.
[01:11:40.315 --> 01:11:45.477]  The only problem was it was scheduled for 9-11 on 2001, and we know what happened then.
[01:11:46.818 --> 01:11:59.623]  And as a result, they put bankruptcy reform on the hold, and it wasn't until just this, well, actually April of 2005 did they finally go through with the new version.
[01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:05.526]  Actually you had the leadership of both parties were pushing it.
[01:12:06.848 --> 01:12:24.684]  And it'll be interesting to see what is going to happen as a result of the investigation into lobbying goes because there was a lot of last minute addendums put into this legislation and I'd be curious to see how that all plays out.
[01:12:25.419 --> 01:12:29.621]  Okay, well, as you just mentioned, this is new legislation.
[01:12:29.681 --> 01:12:31.762]  It went into effect this past October.
[01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:32.543]  17th.
[01:12:32.983 --> 01:12:33.223]  Right.
[01:12:33.503 --> 01:12:44.509]  And my question to you is that how exactly is this particular piece of legislation different from the, say, former legislation in regard to bankruptcy?
[01:12:44.649 --> 01:12:45.850]  Why should I care, in other words?
[01:12:51.163 --> 01:12:56.007]  I'm only going to deal with two types, ones that most people deal with, either a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13.
[01:12:56.047 --> 01:12:56.727]  Okay.
[01:12:58.068 --> 01:13:02.031]  And those are the two that people get involved in.
[01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:07.035]  All the other ones deal with the corporations and stuff, which I'm not going to deal with at the moment.
[01:13:07.735 --> 01:13:12.318]  Basically, you have two types of bankruptcies.
[01:13:12.699 --> 01:13:20.144]  Seven is full discharge, all automatic, where a 13 you go in, and then that's a repayment type.
[01:13:21.469 --> 01:13:28.694]  I've got to tell you right now, if you get too technical, you're going to lose me and I think you'll lose a bunch of the folks out there.
[01:13:28.714 --> 01:13:39.582]  Well, I don't know, like I said, I'm not high finance savvy, but if you get way off the bat here, I think we'll lose a couple folks, so I want to try to keep it as simple as possible.
[01:13:40.523 --> 01:13:48.349]  Well, basically, as simple as possible is that they created a test to determine whether you can file for
[01:13:49.693 --> 01:13:50.333]  Bankruptcy.
[01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:58.817]  First of all, you have to go through a program, you know, which teaches you about how to manage your debt.
[01:13:58.837 --> 01:14:03.879]  And you have to get a certificate from it before you can even file bankruptcy of any kind.
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:12.403]  And then if you get that certificate, you go and then you have to take what is known as a means test.
[01:14:13.564 --> 01:14:15.825]  Now, the means test gives you a clue.
[01:14:15.925 --> 01:14:18.566]  All the figures and determinations are set by the IRS.
[01:14:19.457 --> 01:14:21.418]  I should give you a little... Oh, joy!
[01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:25.040]  Alright, so every state is different.
[01:14:25.501 --> 01:14:31.244]  It's like they have it for an individual, a couple, a two, a family of three, and a family of four.
[01:14:31.264 --> 01:14:40.770]  Anyway, they have these figures, and it's like if you're poor enough, then you pass the first hurdle and you're allowed to file a Chapter 7.
[01:14:41.451 --> 01:14:46.194]  Otherwise, if you go over these figures, you go into the repayment plan and a Chapter 13.
[01:14:49.181 --> 01:15:11.585]  However, even if you're allowed to file the Chapter 7, and if you have as little as $167 extra a month that they can find available to pay to a creditor, or $10,000 over a course of five years, they'll move you back into the repayment plan to enter a Chapter 13.
[01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.585]  Now, a Chapter 13 requires that
[01:15:20.222 --> 01:15:22.224]  You have to pay a minimum now of 25%.
[01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:30.151]  That's somewhat dishonest, but there are ways that's more than 25%.
[01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:38.439]  But anyways, 25% and that was basically the credit card companies wanted that provision in there.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.982]  However, they're still allowed to charge you interest while you're in there.
[01:15:43.964 --> 01:15:45.585]  And now at the same time,
[01:15:46.877 --> 01:15:53.406]  You have to go through a payment plan, you have to divulge it, and it has to be accepted by the court.
[01:15:54.367 --> 01:16:04.681]  If you're unable to meet this plan, there is a way that they can remove you from a Chapter 13 and you're kind of on your own, if they do that.
[01:16:05.419 --> 01:16:08.121]  Okay, let me just change gears a little bit here.
[01:16:08.181 --> 01:16:11.804]  So far what you've been talking about is bankruptcy as far as a consumer is concerned.
[01:16:11.824 --> 01:16:13.044]  A regular guy, you and me.
[01:16:13.545 --> 01:16:22.391]  If I get up to my eyeballs in credit card debt and all of a sudden lose my job and everything, a lot of times there's just no other option.
[01:16:23.038 --> 01:16:24.959]  Now, let's change gears a little bit.
[01:16:24.999 --> 01:16:27.340]  Let's go into the world of high finance.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.081]  You've got the Enron situation there.
[01:16:32.362 --> 01:16:40.365]  How would this apply towards all the big boys that rape and pillage a corporation and then file bankruptcy?
[01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:43.026]  How does it affect them?
[01:16:43.326 --> 01:16:47.207]  Or was this piece of legislation designed to work in their favor?
[01:16:47.487 --> 01:16:51.649]  Well, the only thing that really changed for them
[01:16:52.555 --> 01:17:00.121]  It's been reported that it's their financial disclosure statements they have to sign and there are some penalties involved in this and that.
[01:17:01.002 --> 01:17:13.411]  But as far as I can see, other than the financial disclosures, these things were on the books before and they just removed a lot of this stuff during the Clinton years.
[01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:15.753]  But anyway, now they've put them back on the books.
[01:17:18.841 --> 01:17:27.708]  That part's in play, but as far as some of the other bankruptcy things they changed, there is one provision they did change that may affect Enron.
[01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:34.494]  Because if you notice, your listeners may be interested, but Enron is an Oregon corporation where I live.
[01:17:35.435 --> 01:17:42.601]  They then moved to other states like Texas and had their headquarters there because of what is known as the Homestead Exemption.
[01:17:44.002 --> 01:17:46.404]  In Texas and Florida, prior to this legislation,
[01:17:47.239 --> 01:17:54.545]  Whatever the value of your home was, it was exempt during bankruptcy or any other kind of judgment proceedings against them.
[01:17:55.345 --> 01:18:02.050]  Under the new bankruptcy law, that does get changed unless you've been living in it over 3.3 years.
[01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:11.778]  Now it's the federal bankruptcy homestead exemption is only $125,000, where it was unlimited if you lived in Texas and Florida.
[01:18:13.019 --> 01:18:16.001]  Now that will affect some of the bigwigs down the road.
[01:18:16.562 --> 01:18:20.303]  Other than that, they didn't do much change as far as corporations go.
[01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:39.893]  How this might work to their favor.
[01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:43.978]  But you've got to look at all the numbers and the percentages and all that type of stuff.
[01:18:43.998 --> 01:18:48.525]  Let's see if we can't get this right down to the bare bones minimum when we get back from this break.
[01:18:48.865 --> 01:18:49.366]  Four minutes.

[01:21:55.193 --> 01:21:59.138]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:21:59.519 --> 01:22:03.043]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:22:03.424 --> 01:22:06.968]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:12.235]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:22:12.555 --> 01:22:18.357]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:22:18.657 --> 01:22:22.358]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:22:22.718 --> 01:22:24.799]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:22:25.119 --> 01:22:30.901]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.

[01:22:54.653 --> 01:22:59.897]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday edition of the Power Hour.
[01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:22.533]  Coming up on 25 minutes past the hour, whatever hour you're sitting in, this is Dave and Joyce.
[01:23:22.573 --> 01:23:28.176]  Our guest this hour is Don Markham and he has contributed an article to the Idaho Observer.
[01:23:29.156 --> 01:23:35.100]  Explaining a little bit about the new Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:43.925]  I mean that's a mouthful and trying to wrap your arms around this piece of legislation is very difficult for somebody like me.
[01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:46.166]  Now I don't know about some of the other folks out there.
[01:23:46.206 --> 01:23:52.670]  I know that there are people out there that have a much better understanding of banking and financing and interest rates and
[01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:53.831]  Bankruptcy laws.
[01:23:55.192 --> 01:24:09.606]  But to the common meat and potatoes guy like myself, all I know is that there are so many people that have tons and tons of credit card debt and sooner or later it is indeed going to come back and bite you.
[01:24:10.246 --> 01:24:16.012]  And apparently this piece of legislation is not necessarily what it
[01:24:16.527 --> 01:24:19.148]  It appears to be on the outside.
[01:24:19.568 --> 01:24:21.448]  It has some hidden teeth to it.
[01:24:21.468 --> 01:24:23.389]  That's what you're trying to tell us all, is it not, Mark?
[01:24:23.509 --> 01:24:24.409]  I mean, Don, I'm sorry?
[01:24:24.589 --> 01:24:25.509]  Yes, it is.
[01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:30.991]  And the kind of relief you could have got before October 17th is totally gone.
[01:24:31.131 --> 01:24:38.293]  In fact, this last year, the bankruptcy filings were the highest they ever had.
[01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:47.103]  Which is one reason why the credit card companies are reporting that only four and a half percent of people are now behind in their credit cards.
[01:24:48.244 --> 01:24:53.230]  So a lot of people did take advantage of this before it became an effect.
[01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:59.417]  There's still a lot of people out there that don't know this law and what really is involved with it.
[01:25:01.892 --> 01:25:17.315]  Okay, well if there was one particular difference that you could point out between the old bankruptcy law and this one, if there was one red flag, okay, in a nuts and bolts, meat and potato kind of way, how would you describe that flag?
[01:25:17.735 --> 01:25:23.256]  What is that that's going to basically change your protection?
[01:25:24.076 --> 01:25:27.877]  It's going to be real difficult to do a complete discharge of debt.
[01:25:27.897 --> 01:25:31.498]  You're going to be in a repayment plan which will last up to five years.
[01:25:32.907 --> 01:25:39.183]  And they can prevent you from refiling for eight years now where it used to be seven.
[01:25:41.286 --> 01:25:43.247]  Okay, let me just paint a little picture.
[01:25:43.287 --> 01:25:47.489]  Let's just say that I have a cottage industry.
[01:25:47.969 --> 01:25:48.689]  I work at home.
[01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:55.452]  I have everything that I own, everything I've saved for, everything I've worked for is in my home.
[01:25:56.713 --> 01:26:00.535]  And my income, I make it from my home, and I have a fire.
[01:26:00.795 --> 01:26:01.795]  My house burns down.
[01:26:01.955 --> 01:26:03.556]  I lose everything.
[01:26:03.676 --> 01:26:04.696]  I lose my savings.
[01:26:04.857 --> 01:26:05.757]  I lose everything.
[01:26:06.077 --> 01:26:08.498]  And yet I have, let's say, $200,000 worth of debt.
[01:26:10.763 --> 01:26:15.147]  Okay, or say $100,000 worth of debt, and I have no choice but to file bankruptcy.
[01:26:15.187 --> 01:26:15.828]  What's going to happen?
[01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:18.350]  Well, okay.
[01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:25.376]  First of all, I mean, before you get to file bankruptcy, you're going to have creditors coming after you.
[01:26:25.836 --> 01:26:28.419]  That's going to be the reason why you're going to file bankruptcy.
[01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:28.999]  Right.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:36.706]  And depending how long you wait to file bankruptcy, you may get dragged into court, you may get judgments against you.
[01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:44.532]  And these all work to the advantage of the creditor, so I mean, because they can sell those instruments, you know, once they get a judgment.
[01:26:44.592 --> 01:26:48.833]  Same way, and they get to write it off if you go into bankruptcy and get a discharge.
[01:26:49.953 --> 01:26:52.853]  So there's advantages for them to pressure you.
[01:26:53.614 --> 01:27:03.856]  Now, it sounds like with the kind of money you're talking about, you will be in a repayment plan under Chapter 13, which means that you will have to sit down
[01:27:04.462 --> 01:27:04.702]  I think so.
[01:27:24.366 --> 01:27:27.750]  Alright, well then what do you do?
[01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:30.153]  Are they going to throw you into prison?
[01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:34.958]  I'll give you an example out here in Oregon.
[01:27:35.919 --> 01:27:45.150]  We don't have debtor's prisons like they did in the old days, but prisons are being turned into industrial compounds out here.
[01:27:46.317 --> 01:27:47.758]  Oh, you mean like labor camps?
[01:27:47.978 --> 01:27:49.779]  Well, let's put it this way.
[01:27:49.799 --> 01:27:55.141]  50% of the people in the state penitentiary in Oregon are either there for back child support or driving.
[01:27:55.802 --> 01:27:57.002]  They're not hardened criminals.
[01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:15.812]  So it's not a stretch of the imagination with a few changes of laws that, you know, they could do it because in the state of Oregon, they go international out here and try to drum up business for the, you know, for the prisons out here, you know, for manufacturing and they offer
[01:28:16.776 --> 01:28:22.060]  Guaranteed workforce, you don't have to pay minimum wage, and you don't have to pay insurance benefits.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:27.224]  Well, maybe this is why they privatized so many of the prisons in the past 10, 20 years.
[01:28:27.264 --> 01:28:29.005]  Maybe that's got something to do with it.
[01:28:29.245 --> 01:28:31.747]  Well, they've been doing everything in one slice of time.
[01:28:31.767 --> 01:28:34.890]  They started by, you know, with NAFTA and GATT, you know.
[01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:36.531]  Yeah, I tell you what, hold on to that thought.
[01:28:36.551 --> 01:28:38.392]  Our bottom of the hour break is now upon us.
[01:28:38.432 --> 01:28:39.653]  We'll be back in about three minutes.
[01:28:39.713 --> 01:28:40.894]  And hey, open up the phone lines 1-800-259-9231.

[01:32:08.931 --> 01:32:14.295]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Friday morning edition of the Power Hour, coming up on 34 minutes past the hour.
[01:32:14.355 --> 01:32:14.976]  This is Dave.
[01:32:15.316 --> 01:32:31.488]  And Joyce, and I want to tell everybody on the Kirkman subject, Debbie just reminded me, I just went out to talk to her, and she reminded me that when I had a conference with Robert from the UK, he said that he needed to tell me that there might be a price increase.
[01:32:31.528 --> 01:32:36.572]  Now it has not happened yet, but he said the Kirkman crop
[01:32:37.136 --> 01:32:41.480]  The turmeric crop failed in India this year.
[01:32:42.081 --> 01:32:51.750]  And I was saying to him, you know, how convenient, now that they find out that it can help stop the growth of metastatic tumors, all of a sudden the turmeric crop fails.
[01:32:52.231 --> 01:32:55.354]  And he said that the entire turmeric crop in India failed.
[01:32:55.394 --> 01:32:56.615]  Now, I don't know where else it grows.
[01:32:57.110 --> 01:33:03.297]  But I just wanted to let you know that because of the fact that it could be of real concern if you want to get some.
[01:33:03.717 --> 01:33:15.511]  So I made sure that we had plenty at the Power Hour and I want to thank the gentleman who just called Kelly and told her about his 93-year-old mother who had a very aggressive tumor on her back.
[01:33:16.267 --> 01:33:21.512]  And he said it has not grown in six weeks and she is feeling better and she is asked to go to the beauty shop.
[01:33:21.572 --> 01:33:25.695]  So that is pretty, that really makes us feel good to hear those kinds of things.
[01:33:26.035 --> 01:33:39.347]  We've been hearing that from a lot of people and we can now tell you that statement since the American Cancer Society released the fact that there is, does help to mitigate or stop the growth of metastatic cancer.
[01:33:39.407 --> 01:33:40.568]  So I'm really excited about it.
[01:33:41.028 --> 01:33:46.431]  You can get the Kirkman, and I would encourage you to look at the Kirkman that the Power Hour has.
[01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:48.813]  Because Kirkman is not Kirkman is not Kirkman.
[01:33:49.773 --> 01:33:53.015]  And ours is the strongest that we could find for that price.
[01:33:53.055 --> 01:33:55.176]  You get 200 caps.
[01:33:55.757 --> 01:33:56.357]  200 caps.
[01:33:57.278 --> 01:34:01.960]  And you only need to take two a day if you're okay and you just want to keep it gone.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:02.861]  That's what Robert says.
[01:34:03.736 --> 01:34:04.957]  200 caps for $34.95.
[01:34:06.098 --> 01:34:07.899]  So it's not that expensive.
[01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:10.601]  It's certainly worth it to have it in your little armamentarium.
[01:34:11.022 --> 01:34:13.904]  And I would say probably that it'll last for a long, long time.
[01:34:14.004 --> 01:34:16.266]  But you might want to get curcumin today.
[01:34:16.286 --> 01:34:16.266]  $34.99.
[01:34:16.326 --> 01:34:26.013]  There is no price increase that I know of, though he did call me to tell me that because the India crop failed, that they were going to be expecting it.
[01:34:26.113 --> 01:34:27.554]  So haven't heard anything yet.
[01:34:27.714 --> 01:34:28.515]  Just want to pass it on.
[01:34:28.655 --> 01:34:31.497]  And if you want to order curcumin, and I would encourage you to do it,
[01:34:32.838 --> 01:34:32.918]  877-817-9829.
[01:34:32.938 --> 01:34:33.718]  877-817-9829.
[01:34:34.959 --> 01:34:41.882]  And just remind you of what John said.
[01:34:41.922 --> 01:34:43.343]  He said, my dad had dementia.
[01:34:43.483 --> 01:34:44.544]  He was 81 years old.
[01:34:44.624 --> 01:34:47.005]  He's taking curcumin only for a few days.
[01:34:47.365 --> 01:34:48.306]  And he says he's not back 100%.
[01:34:49.566 --> 01:34:51.287]  But he said they have their dad back.
[01:34:51.327 --> 01:34:52.448]  His energy level is back.
[01:34:53.088 --> 01:34:54.290]  And he's a new man.
[01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:56.652]  And I thank you very much, John, for sharing that with us.
[01:34:56.733 --> 01:34:58.735]  And you know, we also put some into the doggy food.
[01:34:58.755 --> 01:35:00.297]  I told him about that.
[01:35:00.417 --> 01:35:01.478]  Unbelievable change.
[01:35:01.518 --> 01:35:02.039]  New dog.
[01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:02.859]  Yes, we do.
[01:35:02.879 --> 01:35:06.964]  A cleaner coat and doggy smells cleared up.
[01:35:08.025 --> 01:35:10.828]  Brighter eyes, better spirit, the whole nine yards.
[01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.790]  Across the board.
[01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:14.211]  She's a much better, happier puppy.
[01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:33.718]  Anyway, we're talking today with Don Markham, trying to sort out a very confusing and very difficult to understand subject about the Bankruptcy, Abuse, Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, and trying to sort out, find out where the hidden teeth of this particular piece of legislation is, went into effect October 17th of this last year.
[01:35:34.658 --> 01:35:36.259]  Don, we have a couple of callers.
[01:35:36.279 --> 01:35:40.841]  Do you want to finish up what you were trying to explain before we went to the break, or do you want to just go right to the calls?
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.042]  Before we go to the calls, there are some strategies people can use.
[01:35:47.263 --> 01:36:01.750]  Basically, the rich, what they do is they create entities and they own things via entities, whether it's limited liability corporations, limited partnerships, trusts, whatever.
[01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:11.095]  People start buying things and putting them in those names now instead of transferring them in the future.
[01:36:12.509 --> 01:36:16.690]  Things that they buy into those entities, it won't be part of the bankruptcy.
[01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:26.454]  It can't be had or be brought into the bankruptcy proceeding or any other type of proceeding if somebody comes after you for a judgment.
[01:36:27.034 --> 01:36:30.455]  If you try to transfer those things, it could get complicated.
[01:36:30.495 --> 01:36:35.537]  But if you just create an entity, buy it in that entity name, there won't be a problem down the road.
[01:36:36.631 --> 01:36:37.151]  Okay.
[01:36:37.631 --> 01:36:40.412]  All right, I tell you what, let's just go right to the folks.
[01:36:40.632 --> 01:36:46.413]  Some of the listeners will probably be able to ask better questions than I will on this particular subject, so let's go to New York and say hello to Scott.
[01:36:46.453 --> 01:36:48.673]  We have a first-timer on the air.
[01:36:48.994 --> 01:36:50.214]  Welcome aboard, Scott.
[01:36:50.234 --> 01:36:51.974]  Thank you for your call, and welcome to the Power Team.
[01:36:52.154 --> 01:36:52.674]  Yeah, you too.
[01:36:52.714 --> 01:36:54.555]  Hello, Dave and Joyce and Mr. Markham.
[01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.235]  How you doing?
[01:36:56.615 --> 01:36:57.935]  I have a quick question.
[01:36:58.796 --> 01:36:59.736]  I've heard of Chapter 7.
[01:37:00.076 --> 01:37:02.836]  Never heard of Chapter 13.
[01:37:03.516 --> 01:37:04.637]  What happened to Chapter 11?
[01:37:07.222 --> 01:37:11.783]  That's basically, those are not used for individuals.
[01:37:13.783 --> 01:37:17.124]  You have other chapters out there, you got 10, 11, you got 9.
[01:37:17.184 --> 01:37:19.624]  No, but there's all kinds of chapters.
[01:37:19.684 --> 01:37:19.904]  Right.
[01:37:20.264 --> 01:37:24.225]  Because like I've heard of 7, I've heard of 11, like you said, 13 is new to me.
[01:37:24.525 --> 01:37:30.426]  Yeah, 13 has been added over the years and it's basically a repayment plan.
[01:37:30.786 --> 01:37:34.067]  Okay, so all the ones I've mentioned are not for individuals.
[01:37:34.447 --> 01:37:34.707]  Right.
[01:37:35.086 --> 01:37:36.987]  That's all like corporations, businesses?
[01:37:37.147 --> 01:37:41.690]  Corporations, businesses, reorganizations, and some of them are for government.
[01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:49.054]  I'm trying to remember, one of them is for farmers out there, and I believe that's nine, and I don't know whether that's still in effect or not.
[01:37:49.294 --> 01:37:49.734]  Wow.
[01:37:50.775 --> 01:37:51.735]  Well, that was enlightening.
[01:37:52.336 --> 01:37:53.696]  I never knew that there were so many.
[01:37:54.377 --> 01:37:55.077]  Well, there's a lot.
[01:37:55.557 --> 01:38:03.742]  In fact, if you've got a computer, you can look at the different... The bankruptcy code is Title 11 under the United States Code.
[01:38:04.736 --> 01:38:10.540]  I found it interesting that the means test that you brought up was built by the IRS.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:13.161]  Like Dave, I found that very interesting.
[01:38:13.962 --> 01:38:16.083]  When I heard that, my eyebrows went, whoa.
[01:38:16.883 --> 01:38:18.624]  You know there's something bad going on there.
[01:38:19.225 --> 01:38:21.466]  Oh, gosh, yeah.
[01:38:21.486 --> 01:38:24.068]  This is what I personally see.
[01:38:24.108 --> 01:38:24.968]  I don't know for sure.
[01:38:24.988 --> 01:38:26.569]  It's just my opinion.
[01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:29.451]  I do see the reemergence of the debtor's prison.
[01:38:30.992 --> 01:38:32.593]  There's going to be so many people.
[01:38:33.223 --> 01:38:36.926]  They're not going to be able to get through this, and they're just going to end up in bigger trouble.
[01:38:37.226 --> 01:38:49.596]  That's exactly what my knee-jerk reaction was, because they have been privatizing the prisons for years and years and years, and I do see... I mean, we know that prison labor has been available for businesses for quite some time.
[01:38:49.616 --> 01:38:49.976]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:50.177 --> 01:39:01.666]  I mean, you can get very cheap labor, you know, farming out a particular project, if you have a widget that you want manufactured, and you still want it to say made in the USA, well then, you know, you get a broker and they will handle
[01:39:02.086 --> 01:39:06.790]  The arrangements where they have prison workers make pieces for your widget.
[01:39:07.130 --> 01:39:07.931]  Exactly.
[01:39:08.311 --> 01:39:10.593]  And you can get a tax write-off as well now.
[01:39:10.613 --> 01:39:11.054]  That's right.
[01:39:11.074 --> 01:39:11.614]  For the prison.
[01:39:11.875 --> 01:39:12.395]  That's right.
[01:39:12.515 --> 01:39:16.078]  And for the person wanting the work done, they get a write-off too.
[01:39:16.879 --> 01:39:19.101]  And this fits into the whole master plan.
[01:39:19.121 --> 01:39:20.542]  We've been asking the question for years.
[01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:22.984]  Do more laws make more freedoms?
[01:39:23.024 --> 01:39:23.665]  Of course not.
[01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:25.766]  Our legislators pass 20,000 laws every year.
[01:39:27.888 --> 01:39:36.597]  I mean, one way or the other, no matter what you do and how many T's you cross and I's you dot, you're breaking the law somewhere, and if they catch you, they'll throw you in prison.
[01:39:37.057 --> 01:39:37.377]  That's right.
[01:39:37.397 --> 01:39:38.919]  That brings in the whole Bin Laden thing.
[01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:40.961]  We just heard about this new Bin Laden tape.
[01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:46.526]  I know it's a little off-topic, but the thing is, you know, it's not... They're not... You know, you can say Al-Qaeda.
[01:39:46.546 --> 01:39:47.828]  They're not threatening our freedoms.
[01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:50.891]  It's our own legislators that are taking away our freedoms.
[01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:51.511]  Mm-hmm.
[01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:52.332]  That's right.
[01:39:53.041 --> 01:39:53.461]  That's right.
[01:39:53.842 --> 01:39:55.823]  That's the question that we've posed here, you know.
[01:39:56.044 --> 01:39:59.567]  How many of your laws are legislated away by Saddam or Osama or Al Qaeda?
[01:39:59.587 --> 01:40:00.347]  The answer is none.
[01:40:01.108 --> 01:40:02.449]  So, hey Scott, thank you.
[01:40:02.649 --> 01:40:05.872]  By the way, how do you listen to the broadcast?
[01:40:05.952 --> 01:40:06.272]  WHRI 9840.
[01:40:06.653 --> 01:40:07.493]  Fantastic!
[01:40:08.034 --> 01:40:09.455]  Well, thank you for calling in.
[01:40:09.515 --> 01:40:11.036]  I look forward to hearing from you again.
[01:40:11.277 --> 01:40:11.657]  Thank you.
[01:40:11.797 --> 01:40:12.618]  Alright, you have a good day.
[01:40:12.658 --> 01:40:15.080]  Let's go to Mark in Georgia.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.841]  Mark, welcome aboard.
[01:40:16.881 --> 01:40:17.302]  You're on the air.
[01:40:17.362 --> 01:40:17.642]  Go ahead.
[01:40:18.527 --> 01:40:23.231]  All I gotta say is I had an enlightening situation over Christmas.
[01:40:23.571 --> 01:40:27.675]  I got $30,000 in debt, credit card, and I've been carrying it since 94.
[01:40:27.775 --> 01:40:34.980]  I just keep rolling it over because that's pretty much all I can do until my wife graduates from college and makes big money.
[01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:39.804]  But this Vietnam vet was telling me what you guys just talked about.
[01:40:40.005 --> 01:40:45.269]  I mean, we're going to be under a police state slash prison because of the Illuminati.
[01:40:46.089 --> 01:40:49.470]  They're slowly but surely taking over America and freedom.
[01:40:50.171 --> 01:40:51.851]  And, you know, it scares me.
[01:40:51.931 --> 01:40:58.734]  I have freaking nightmares that I'm going to wind up in prison because I can't pay my bills.
[01:40:59.174 --> 01:41:06.097]  And I've had sheriffs come to the house and we just go to the court and just tell them, look, we're playing on, we're honorable.
[01:41:06.137 --> 01:41:07.237]  We're playing on paying it.
[01:41:07.277 --> 01:41:08.278]  We just can't pay it now.
[01:41:08.338 --> 01:41:09.478]  We're raising five kids.
[01:41:10.259 --> 01:41:13.520]  And, uh, and this Vietnam vet, he's,
[01:41:14.244 --> 01:41:16.165]  He's a Jesuit and all this other stuff.
[01:41:16.225 --> 01:41:19.326]  I mean, he's real high up there in the Illuminati.
[01:41:19.966 --> 01:41:27.649]  And he literally said that Mark, you better take care of business because they're going to clamp down and they're slowly doing that.
[01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:36.453]  Bush is shredding the Constitution left and right with the Patriot Act and then creating the Homeland Security.
[01:41:37.673 --> 01:41:42.895]  And I don't know, I just want to know if he does agree or disagree about
[01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:48.443]  Us all becoming slaves to the haves and us being the have-nots.
[01:41:48.663 --> 01:41:50.364]  Okay, Mark, thank you for your question.
[01:41:50.864 --> 01:41:56.826]  Don, do you think, like, we're thinking that this is going to be heading towards a debtor's prison and a forced labor camp situation?
[01:41:57.246 --> 01:42:06.748]  Well, I don't know about... Well, debtor's prisons is getting near that point, and it wouldn't surprise me if they did, but you're not a free person if you're in debt.
[01:42:07.349 --> 01:42:08.989]  You're bound, you know, to the master.
[01:42:09.349 --> 01:42:09.629]  Right.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.082]  You know, it's ugly no matter what's going to happen.
[01:42:17.122 --> 01:42:21.483]  I mean, I'm more scared about this new guy they're going to bring in as the head of the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:21.944 --> 01:42:22.344]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:22.584 --> 01:42:30.907]  Because they're discussing now even stop publishing to the public M1, M2, M3 reports.
[01:42:31.067 --> 01:42:37.110]  Those are the reports that tell you how fast the printing press is going and how much money is in circulation.
[01:42:38.072 --> 01:42:43.414]  And if they start printing money and they don't tell you how much is out there, you don't know how much inflation is taking place.
[01:42:43.814 --> 01:42:44.714]  Right, right.
[01:42:45.374 --> 01:42:47.655]  Okay, let's go to Stuart in New York.
[01:42:47.735 --> 01:42:49.815]  Stuart, D35 Dittos, good morning.
[01:42:49.895 --> 01:42:50.535]  Welcome aboard.
[01:42:50.815 --> 01:42:51.275]  Good morning.
[01:42:52.516 --> 01:43:05.039]  Regarding the situation, if you're somebody who does not qualify for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, and you have debts, and for whatever reason you just can't pay them at that time,
[01:43:06.497 --> 01:43:07.618]  Well, what can you do?
[01:43:07.658 --> 01:43:09.338]  That's question number one.
[01:43:09.398 --> 01:43:25.244]  Number two, I hear these advertisements on the radio all the time, in fact a lot on Genesis, of these organizations where they say they'll negotiate with the credit card companies and cut the interest and put everything into one lump sum and they'll help you pay it off that way.
[01:43:25.344 --> 01:43:26.024]  Are they legit?
[01:43:26.064 --> 01:43:29.145]  Is that the way to go rather than trying bankruptcy?
[01:43:29.205 --> 01:43:33.987]  The trouble of it is finding which ones are legit and which ones just spin you around.
[01:43:34.525 --> 01:43:36.185]  And there are some legit ones out there.
[01:43:36.245 --> 01:43:42.686]  I don't know which ones they are, but what I've been hearing from people is they're hard to find legit.
[01:43:44.267 --> 01:43:56.289]  And, uh, but I will tell you, I mean, most credit card companies, whether you're in bankruptcy or not, if you have a cash offer and you can give them a lump sum, it could be as low as a third or 50%.
[01:43:56.469 --> 01:44:03.910]  If you offer it, you know, them a lump sum, they'll accept it and, you know, close your whole account.
[01:44:04.872 --> 01:44:06.393]  That's happened before.
[01:44:06.413 --> 01:44:07.334]  I know people have done it.
[01:44:07.654 --> 01:44:08.835]  Okay.
[01:44:08.955 --> 01:44:12.337]  Will that negatively affect your credit rating if you do it that way?
[01:44:12.838 --> 01:44:12.998]  Right.
[01:44:13.118 --> 01:44:21.323]  Because it's going to come on your credit report, and if they don't, then you can sue them.
[01:44:21.363 --> 01:44:26.787]  The Fair Credit Reporting Act, and there's a couple other federal statutes, they have it.
[01:44:26.847 --> 01:44:30.269]  They've got only like 30 or 60 days to correct that.
[01:44:31.826 --> 01:44:34.368]  You know, any derogatory remark on your credit report.
[01:44:34.408 --> 01:44:38.491]  You know, I mean, if I paid them off, I would wait 30 days, get a credit report.
[01:44:39.271 --> 01:44:47.357]  And then if they don't, I'd give them a written notice and at that point, and they don't do nothing about it, then I would take them to court and sue them.
[01:44:47.577 --> 01:44:53.341]  So you're saying that some of these credit card companies, let's say, for example, if you owe them, let's say $5,000, you say, okay,
[01:44:56.264 --> 01:44:58.225]  I lost my job or whatever yada yada.
[01:44:58.546 --> 01:45:00.907]  I can pay you $2500 cash right now.
[01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:03.549]  Do you take it?
[01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:07.251]  They might try to negotiate with you a little bit, but by and large they will.
[01:45:07.791 --> 01:45:25.062]  And even if they wouldn't, took you to court and sued you and got a judgment, they always are willing to, especially after a judgment, they're willing to settle for less because they get the right off the other money in a manner which is very beneficial to them for taxes.
[01:45:25.325 --> 01:45:30.929]  Okay, now if they do get a judgment against you and they settle on this, does that still go on your credit report?
[01:45:30.949 --> 01:45:31.649]  Yes, it will.
[01:45:31.829 --> 01:45:44.718]  However, the state bankruptcy exemptions come into play because every time they get a judgment against you, you're allowed to exempt certain property from civil judgment using your state bankruptcy laws.
[01:45:45.278 --> 01:45:52.223]  Now they vary from state to state, and I live in a state which doesn't have very good exemptions, but
[01:45:53.331 --> 01:45:56.454]  I'm just letting people know that, you know, they just can't take everything.
[01:45:56.494 --> 01:45:58.695]  They just can't take 100% of your check.
[01:45:58.755 --> 01:46:02.238]  They can't take all the value, you know, of something.
[01:46:02.258 --> 01:46:03.959]  You know, you're allowed certain exemptions.
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:13.447]  Like, you know, most states it's 25-30% usually tops of your paycheck a month if they got a garnishment against you.
[01:46:15.033 --> 01:46:21.495]  As far as the interest rates on some of these cards, I have some that are as high as 22-23%.
[01:46:21.895 --> 01:46:23.115]  Oh man, that's bad!
[01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:30.596]  I just received some new agreements.
[01:46:30.916 --> 01:46:34.997]  They can go as high as 30% now, under the new legislation.
[01:46:35.757 --> 01:46:38.438]  And they get to charge you more in the month of December.
[01:46:40.398 --> 01:46:43.019]  So it makes it almost impossible to pay the damn things off.
[01:46:45.194 --> 01:46:47.075]  And can that be negotiated?
[01:46:47.135 --> 01:46:53.778]  I mean, if you call them and say, you know, hey, 30% or 22% is is usurous.
[01:46:54.118 --> 01:46:56.939]  Well, no, they change the law so it isn't usurous anymore.
[01:46:57.019 --> 01:46:59.000]  And it's even, I'll give you a clue.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:04.363]  And all credit card companies do this and they communicate with one another.
[01:47:05.003 --> 01:47:12.947]  If you fall behind on one credit card from one company, by law, the other companies through the agreement, you have it, you never read.
[01:47:14.096 --> 01:47:18.319]  Can raise your interest rate on you for failing to pay the other company.
[01:47:18.639 --> 01:47:19.740]  Oh my goodness.
[01:47:20.701 --> 01:47:22.642]  Hey Stuart, thank you so much for the call.
[01:47:22.682 --> 01:47:24.523]  You bring out some really good points.
[01:47:24.563 --> 01:47:27.606]  You know, I'm listening to this conversation and I'm sitting here thinking, well what if?
[01:47:27.846 --> 01:47:28.406]  What if?
[01:47:28.826 --> 01:47:32.729]  What if all of a sudden our relations with China were to break down here?
[01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:35.531]  And what if there was an economic collapse?
[01:47:35.571 --> 01:47:39.214]  And what if all of these people that are up to their eyeballs and debt couldn't pay
[01:47:39.955 --> 01:47:51.039]  What if America had no choice but to rebuild the very base structure of its own industry, and all these people go bankrupt, and they all get thrown into prisons because of it?
[01:47:51.499 --> 01:47:57.701]  My goodness, we certainly would need a huge labor force to rebuild and reconstruct industry.
[01:47:58.041 --> 01:47:58.361]  You know?
[01:47:58.421 --> 01:47:59.902]  I mean, how convenient would that be?
[01:48:00.122 --> 01:48:07.164]  Let's go to Tim in Florida, and somehow, Tim, I don't think a rife machine is going to clear away debt, so let's stay on topic.
[01:48:10.132 --> 01:48:13.293]  I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:14.153]  Chapter 11.
[01:48:15.394 --> 01:48:16.674]  That's for corporations?
[01:48:17.155 --> 01:48:17.395]  Right.
[01:48:18.315 --> 01:48:18.715]  Okay.
[01:48:19.115 --> 01:48:23.537]  In 1933, when they collateralized the people, we became dummy corporations.
[01:48:25.697 --> 01:48:33.380]  When a child is born, a birth certificate is sent to, I think it's New York, called the Tower of Power.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:38.742]  The dummy corporation, the child becomes a dummy corporation,
[01:48:39.398 --> 01:48:41.639]  And a bond is put on that child.
[01:48:42.059 --> 01:48:44.220]  In 1933, it was a million dollars.
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.361]  I don't know how much the collateral is today.
[01:48:47.441 --> 01:48:49.382]  Well, we are dummy corporations.
[01:48:49.882 --> 01:48:55.105]  So we should be able to file Chapter 11 because we are a corporation.
[01:48:55.625 --> 01:48:58.526]  The IRS only takes corporations.
[01:48:58.806 --> 01:49:01.467]  They do not take natural men or natural women.
[01:49:02.247 --> 01:49:03.368]  Flesh and blood human beings.
[01:49:04.448 --> 01:49:06.009]  And peoples-right.com
[01:49:08.826 --> 01:49:10.568]  He explains all about this.
[01:49:11.028 --> 01:49:11.308]  Yes.
[01:49:11.509 --> 01:49:20.837]  And if you could get Dave on your show at the Power Hour, he can explain everything about the fraud, about credit.
[01:49:21.097 --> 01:49:24.641]  Your name means credit, and credit is fraud.
[01:49:24.861 --> 01:49:32.528]  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the creature from Jekyll Island, explains all about the credit, how it's fraud.
[01:49:33.257 --> 01:49:38.280]  Okay, well thank you for the contribution, and hopefully we'll get Don to comment on that.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.241]  How does this all fit in here?
[01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:43.863]  I think we all sort of know the answer, but I'd like to hear it from him.
[01:49:43.883 --> 01:49:45.484]  We're going to take our three-minute break.
[01:49:45.524 --> 01:49:48.005]  We'll be back to wrap it up with our guest Don Markham.
[01:49:48.045 --> 01:49:48.526]  Stay with us.
[01:49:48.646 --> 01:49:49.166]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.693 --> 01:50:04.975]  During the last 50 years, hundreds of thousands of military personnel have been involved in human experimentation and other intentional exposures conducted by the Department of Defense, often without a service member's knowledge or consent.
[01:50:05.575 --> 01:50:07.496]  That is the opening statement of Senate Report 103-97.
[01:50:07.676 --> 01:50:22.479]  The Atomic Vets, White Coat Vets, Vietnam Vets, Gulf War Vets, and now Gulf War II Vets, all used as unwitting subjects and exposed to chemicals, biologicals, radiation, experimental vaccinations, psychedelic drugs, depleted uranium, and more, and then denied treatment.
[01:50:22.919 --> 01:50:26.522]  Beyond Treason exposes these horrendous experiments and demands accountability.
[01:50:26.922 --> 01:50:36.248]  Beyond Treason comes with a CD-ROM that contains thousands of pages of documents to prove that our own government has been involved in what can only be described as activity that goes beyond treason.
[01:50:36.588 --> 01:50:36.868]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:50:36.889 --> 01:50:38.069]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit beyondtreason.com.
[01:50:38.169 --> 01:50:39.951]  Only $19.95 plus shipping for the DVD and the CD-ROM.
[01:50:40.011 --> 01:50:40.891]  Call 877-817-9829 and order today.
[01:50:40.971 --> 01:50:42.532]  What you will see goes beyond treason.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.121]  You don't love me anymore?
[01:50:55.441 --> 01:50:57.243]  You used to take such good care of me.
[01:50:57.263 --> 01:50:58.744]  Is that my car talking to me?
[01:50:58.884 --> 01:50:59.184]  Yes.
[01:50:59.484 --> 01:51:00.325]  You neglect me.
[01:51:00.485 --> 01:51:02.467]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[01:51:04.228 --> 01:51:05.329]  You're the cheapest gas.
[01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:06.530]  I'm getting sick.
[01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:09.012]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[01:51:10.072 --> 01:51:10.553]  Wait a minute.
[01:51:10.633 --> 01:51:12.253]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[01:51:12.493 --> 01:51:21.057]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[01:51:21.517 --> 01:51:26.980]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:29.601]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:34.424]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[01:51:34.644 --> 01:51:36.285]  I'll always be there for you.
[01:51:36.485 --> 01:51:39.806]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[01:51:39.987 --> 01:51:44.329]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:51:44.429 --> 01:51:45.750]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:51:55.743 --> 01:51:56.083]  I think so.
[01:52:10.968 --> 01:52:11.628]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.504 --> 01:52:43.588]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.748 --> 01:52:49.715]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.983 --> 01:52:59.987]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Power Hour!
[01:53:04.717 --> 01:53:08.978]  We're coming up on 55 minutes past the hour, whatever hour you're sitting in.
[01:53:09.318 --> 01:53:19.281]  And a quick reminder for those of you listening to the rebroadcast of this program on WHRA, you're dialed into 5.850 at the moment, but you'll have to change your receiver to 7.55 in about
[01:53:25.366 --> 01:53:35.496]  We've been talking this hour with Don Markham, who is a paralegal and has been examining a lot of the legislation in regard to bankruptcy laws.
[01:53:36.036 --> 01:53:41.963]  And he's written an article which is posted in the current issue of the Idaho Observer, which I highly recommend.
[01:53:42.023 --> 01:53:47.429]  And there's two newspapers in this country that are worth their salt, and that's of course the American Free Press and the Idaho Observer.
[01:53:47.449 --> 01:53:49.531]  Oh, and I don't want to forget the Lone Star Iconoclast.
[01:53:51.053 --> 01:53:55.818]  But still, I mean, with one hand I could count the number of newspapers that are decent in this country.
[01:53:56.558 --> 01:54:02.421]  Don, as we wrap this up here, what is your advice to folks out there?
[01:54:02.441 --> 01:54:05.823]  I mean, a lot of folks are just saying, hey, look, if there's only one thing, get out of debt.
[01:54:05.843 --> 01:54:07.023]  Do you subscribe to that philosophy?
[01:54:07.043 --> 01:54:07.964]  I absolutely subscribe.
[01:54:08.044 --> 01:54:14.767]  It took me a lot of years to do that, and I finally have accomplished it, and I advocate doing that.
[01:54:15.267 --> 01:54:20.690]  The second thing I advocate is if you've got to buy something, create an entity and have it, buy it.
[01:54:22.901 --> 01:54:29.466]  Because if you go into debt and they want to sue you or drag you into bankruptcy or whatever, that separate entity is never you.
[01:54:31.748 --> 01:54:32.189]  Okay.
[01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:36.752]  Alright, now do you have a website?
[01:54:36.872 --> 01:54:40.095]  Or are we going to direct everybody directly to the Idaho Observer?
[01:54:41.136 --> 01:54:44.198]  The Idaho Observer, I can give out an email.
[01:54:44.298 --> 01:54:48.662]  Somebody out there wants to send me an email and I'll answer a question if they type in
[01:54:49.778 --> 01:54:52.121]  Power Hour question or something in the subject line.
[01:54:52.541 --> 01:54:52.861]  Okay.
[01:54:53.042 --> 01:54:58.147]  Well, first of all, the website for Idaho Observer is Idaho-Observer.com.
[01:54:58.187 --> 01:55:00.870]  And go ahead, give out any other contact that you want, Doc.
[01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:02.012]  Okay.
[01:55:02.312 --> 01:55:05.536]  Email address is Markham, M-A-R-K-H-M-A-M.
[01:55:07.727 --> 01:55:09.428]  GoWebWay.com.
[01:55:09.468 --> 01:55:11.889]  G-O-W-E-B-W-A-Y.
[01:55:11.969 --> 01:55:16.972]  Okay, would you redo that again because it's... Markham is what?
[01:55:17.432 --> 01:55:19.973]  M-A-R-K-H-A-M.
[01:55:20.033 --> 01:55:20.693]  There you go.
[01:55:20.893 --> 01:55:21.294]  Okay.
[01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:22.214]  Alright, let's do it.
[01:55:22.234 --> 01:55:24.535]  We've got one more call to squeeze into the top of the hour.
[01:55:24.675 --> 01:55:26.376]  Jeff in Massachusetts, welcome aboard.
[01:55:26.396 --> 01:55:27.797]  You're on the air with our guest Don Markham.
[01:55:28.297 --> 01:55:28.677]  Oh, yes.
[01:55:29.057 --> 01:55:34.900]  As far as the Idaho Observer is concerned, what do you see as far as the future of the United States is concerned?
[01:55:35.393 --> 01:55:38.095]  Do you see the United States getting out of the U.N.
[01:55:38.455 --> 01:55:39.376]  and getting out of debt?
[01:55:39.476 --> 01:55:41.858]  Well, that's sort of not really on topic.
[01:55:41.878 --> 01:55:44.079]  The debt part, yeah, but what do you see, Don?
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:53.126]  Well, I see us, they're going to attempt to make Canada, United States, and Mexico one big happy family.
[01:55:54.687 --> 01:55:56.288]  The reason why I mention the U.N.
[01:55:56.348 --> 01:55:59.210]  is this, because the U.N.
[01:55:59.270 --> 01:56:04.814]  wants global taxation, and this will increase the debt in the United States of America.
[01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:08.111]  You see, because the two are interconnected, basically.
[01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:09.532]  So that's why I threw the U.N.
[01:56:09.572 --> 01:56:09.912]  in there.
[01:56:10.392 --> 01:56:15.494]  Yeah, but they're going to do it in steps, and the first step is to create one government and one continent.
[01:56:15.914 --> 01:56:22.397]  Like, you know, you've got the European community over there, and they're going to do one for North America.
[01:56:23.277 --> 01:56:30.520]  Because Joan Beyond has done a lot of research on the U.N., and the roots of a lot of these problems are connected to that.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.041]  As John Birch would always say, get the U.S.
[01:56:33.061 --> 01:56:35.062]  out of the U.N., less government,
[01:56:35.458 --> 01:56:37.840]  More responsibility, with God's help, a better world.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:39.380]  That's what we need.
[01:56:40.121 --> 01:56:40.501]  Period.
[01:56:40.521 --> 01:56:45.204]  Because governments create genocide, and governments create debt, and governments are a drag.
[01:56:45.604 --> 01:56:50.027]  Well, all you gotta do is look at the UN track record, and you'll see the genocide.
[01:56:50.427 --> 01:56:50.968]  Oh, of course.
[01:56:51.028 --> 01:56:52.208]  That is a fact.
[01:56:52.649 --> 01:56:52.909]  Oh, yeah.
[01:56:53.351 --> 01:56:53.591]  Oh yeah.
[01:56:53.852 --> 01:56:55.293]  Guys, have an excellent weekend.
[01:56:55.594 --> 01:56:57.075]  Alright, well thank you for the phone call.
[01:56:57.115 --> 01:56:59.658]  And Don Markham, thank you so much for joining us this hour.
[01:56:59.958 --> 01:57:05.805]  Hopefully we've been able to shed a little bit of light on this most confusing subject in regard to bankruptcy.
[01:57:06.165 --> 01:57:11.471]  And again, I would encourage folks to go to idaho-observer.com to check it out.
[01:57:11.631 --> 01:57:13.313]  Don, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:57:13.653 --> 01:57:14.354]  You have a good day.
[01:57:14.815 --> 01:57:15.335]  Thank you.
[01:57:15.355 --> 01:57:18.337]  And I just want to let you all know, we're going to be closed for the next hour.
[01:57:18.377 --> 01:57:20.298]  The power hour from 9 to 10 a.m.
[01:57:20.318 --> 01:57:24.880]  will be closed, but we will hopefully be open to take your orders after 10 a.m.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.641]  Central Time at 877-817-9829.
[01:57:25.661 --> 01:57:27.222]  We'll be back in one minute, ten seconds.
[01:58:05.672 --> 01:58:09.695]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday morning edition of The Power Hour.
[01:58:09.735 --> 01:58:11.716]  Straight up, top of the hour, plus one minute.
[01:58:14.198 --> 01:58:18.040]  And we're going to have open lines for the remainder of the broadcast.
[01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:22.624]  And a couple of issues here that I wanted to bring to light.
[01:58:22.764 --> 01:58:27.207]  I understand that you remember the folks from worldcantwait.org.
[01:58:27.987 --> 01:58:30.429]  We tried to throw them a little bit of support.
[01:58:31.079 --> 01:58:43.170]  And although we all agree that we have a real problem with the current regime we're living under, my particular philosophy is just like what Jack Palance tried to tell Billy Crystal in the movie City Slickers.
[01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:44.691]  It's one thing.
[01:58:45.032 --> 01:58:46.993]  Leave all the other stuff aside.
[01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:49.075]  Let's all agree on one thing.
[01:58:49.175 --> 01:58:54.240]  Focus on one thing, like a laser beam, and accomplish that one thing.
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:59:00.186]  Some folks just don't get it, and they feel that they have to drag all their other issues along with them.
[01:59:00.226 --> 01:59:09.995]  You know, okay, abortion, and gay rights, and racism, and all this other stuff, which may be legitimate arguments.
[01:59:10.055 --> 01:59:13.979]  Of course, there are people who stand on both sides of any particular debate.
[01:59:14.419 --> 01:59:17.402]  But when it comes to one thing, it's one thing.
[01:59:17.582 --> 01:59:19.064]  And that's my particular philosophy.
[01:59:19.424 --> 01:59:25.707]  Well, one thing that they're focusing on is trying to get Bush out of office, and I can agree with that one thing.
[01:59:26.307 --> 01:59:35.911]  And World Can't Wait has taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times, and it basically screams the headline, Bush Step Down!
[01:59:36.592 --> 01:59:44.935]  January 31st, President Bush will be giving his State of the Union address, and the State of the Union is in a state of emergency.
[01:59:45.996 --> 01:59:48.637]  They are basically advocating everybody
[01:59:49.369 --> 02:00:03.946]  to uh... protest and demonstrate at eight o'clock eastern standard time around the country in large cities and town squares they want people to rally one hour before bush's address and uh... at nine p m
[02:00:04.933 --> 02:00:09.975]  It says, let the world hear as we symbolically drown out Bush's lies.
[02:00:10.055 --> 02:00:15.497]  Bring your own noise, drums, pots, pans, musical instruments, your voice.
[02:00:15.957 --> 02:00:23.240]  Let taxi horns blare and church bells ring as we bring our own State of the Union message.
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:26.121]  Bush, step down!
[02:00:27.151 --> 02:00:31.876]  I think that this is going to be interesting to see how this is going to unfold here.
[02:00:33.177 --> 02:00:38.363]  I think we can all agree that we have a very serious problem with the direction our country is taking under the Bush regime.
[02:00:38.383 --> 02:00:45.010]  You may or may not want to participate in this, but I'm sure they have details.
[02:00:45.718 --> 02:00:55.444]  At their website, worldcantwait.org, and I know some of you folks are saying, wait a second, you're promoting a bunch of people that are advocating homosexuality and abortion and stuff.
[02:00:55.604 --> 02:00:56.505]  No, I'm not.
[02:00:56.745 --> 02:00:58.146]  I am absolutely not.
[02:00:59.607 --> 02:01:04.970]  I do focus in on one thing, and hopefully we all can too.
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:08.702]  And I know that there's folks out there that can't get by that.
[02:01:08.722 --> 02:01:13.826]  You know, if you get equally yoked with these people, say, wait a second, wait a minute.
[02:01:14.286 --> 02:01:17.208]  All the folks that subscribe to that philosophy, let me ask you a question.
[02:01:17.649 --> 02:01:20.511]  Do you have any members of your family in the military?
[02:01:21.151 --> 02:01:22.312]  I'm sure many of you do.
[02:01:22.632 --> 02:01:28.696]  We have a lot of very good, devout Christians and Bible believers out there that have members in the military.
[02:01:29.017 --> 02:01:29.597]  Well, guess what?
[02:01:29.637 --> 02:01:33.640]  If you've got people in the military, then you are also involved
[02:01:34.295 --> 02:01:40.042]  With people of other faiths, people of other beliefs, people of other sexual persuasions.
[02:01:40.362 --> 02:01:42.645]  That doesn't mean that you're equally yoked with them.
[02:01:43.386 --> 02:01:48.372]  It just means that you're serving the military in the best way, and if you're serving your country, the best way that you know how.
[02:01:48.792 --> 02:01:49.713]  It's that one thing.
[02:01:50.534 --> 02:01:50.815]  Okay?
[02:01:51.497 --> 02:01:57.542]  So, I am not equally yoked with anybody that has a different philosophy as far as sexuality or abortion or anything like that.
[02:01:57.822 --> 02:02:10.213]  We can agree with one thing, and that is that the direction this country is taking is absolutely maniacal, it is suicidal, and it is disruptive for the peace and sanctity of this world.
[02:02:11.093 --> 02:02:19.996]  So, for whatever reason, if you care to join the likes of Edward Asner, Harry Belafonte, Michael Eric Dyson, Jane Fonda?
[02:02:20.296 --> 02:02:21.717]  She's going to be there, holy mackerel!
[02:02:21.997 --> 02:02:25.518]  Jessica Lange, Lewis Larpum, U.S.
[02:02:25.598 --> 02:02:30.880]  Representative Major Owens, Sean Penn, Susan Saradon, Rev.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:36.142]  Errol Sharpton, Cindy Sheehan, Gore Vidal, Howard Zinn,
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.547]  My goodness, a lot of people are going to be involved in this whole thing.
[02:02:39.767 --> 02:02:41.271]  So, anyway, we're going to take our break.
[02:02:41.351 --> 02:02:42.293]  Open up the phone lines 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:45.882 --> 02:02:49.265]  Pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals all make money from sick people.
[02:02:49.486 --> 02:02:51.527]  So what incentive is there for them to make you well?
[02:02:51.848 --> 02:02:57.473]  For thousands of years, man has used spices and herbs to ward off disease and cure, yes cure, illness.
[02:02:57.733 --> 02:03:00.936]  It's no wonder the drug manufacturers feel threatened by spices and herbs.
[02:03:01.317 --> 02:03:06.121]  The North American Herb and Spice Company manufactures the products that Dr. Cass Ingram has been recommending for years.
[02:03:06.381 --> 02:03:10.005]  The Oregosin, Oreganol, and Oregamax are working wonders for people all over the country.
[02:03:10.245 --> 02:03:10.606]  I think so.
[02:03:25.242 --> 02:03:25.562]  Thank you.
[02:03:46.388 --> 02:03:49.993]  Yes, there is a choice, a real alternative when it comes to news and information.

[02:04:46.323 --> 02:04:46.663]  I think so.
[02:05:01.608 --> 02:05:02.209]  I think so.
[02:05:22.568 --> 02:05:22.908]  I think so.
[02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:59.628]  Hi everybody, this is Davon Kleist and Joyce Riley, and we all know knowledge is power, and that's why we call this the Power Hour!
[02:06:01.409 --> 02:06:16.935]  The opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of the staff, management, sponsors of this radio station, and those yet to respond.
[02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:25.094]  Alright, welcome to Hour Number 3 of today's installment of The Power Hour.
[02:06:25.174 --> 02:06:31.097]  And for those of you listening live, I just want to let you know that we are not answering the phones for the next hour.
[02:06:32.438 --> 02:06:42.143]  We have a situation, nothing big or anything like that, but we fired up a new heater unit.
[02:06:42.763 --> 02:06:51.205]  And I don't know if you know about heaters, space heaters and stuff like that, but when you turn them on for the first time, sometimes they smoke a little bit and let off a funny smell.
[02:06:51.705 --> 02:06:52.325]  Well, it did.
[02:06:52.585 --> 02:06:55.106]  And some people went, oh, this smells terrible.
[02:06:55.126 --> 02:06:58.746]  So anyway, we just had to open up all the windows and air the place out.
[02:06:58.846 --> 02:07:00.967]  So anyway, no big deal.
[02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:05.228]  So if you're calling in right now, you're not going to get answered, OK?
[02:07:05.268 --> 02:07:08.448]  We just opened up the windows, and everybody's out there taking a walk right now.
[02:07:08.488 --> 02:07:09.148]  It's not a big deal.
[02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:12.029]  But anyway, we're going to have open lines here, but before we do,
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:18.601]  I wanted to share with you a couple of letters here.
[02:07:18.621 --> 02:07:20.382]  I mentioned one yesterday.
[02:07:20.422 --> 02:07:24.144]  I didn't get to it because we had open lines and I almost did it again today.
[02:07:24.584 --> 02:07:26.845]  But there's a couple of things I wanted to share with you.
[02:07:26.965 --> 02:07:29.086]  First of all, I got an email here from a student by the name of Matt.
[02:07:30.266 --> 02:07:39.493]  And he says he's a student at Valparaiso University in Indiana and recently watched the video 9-11 in plain sight and he says he was completely astonished because it was so thought-provoking.
[02:07:39.853 --> 02:07:46.999]  He says, I'm left in some confusion completely as to what to do about this matter and how to tell people and get this message out in the communities of America.
[02:07:47.279 --> 02:07:55.585]  I've never heard anyone talk of this movie until my friend introduced me to it, which means people who are unaware or don't care or they'll just never hear of it.
[02:07:55.965 --> 02:08:11.680]  I want to find a way to present this to a larger audience with a viewing basis without raising a biased view and showing that I neither support liberal or conservative views but stand neutral so that people can see that we're not fighting for a view but for the truth.
[02:08:12.273 --> 02:08:12.773]  Wow!
[02:08:13.054 --> 02:08:14.254]  He's out of the cage!
[02:08:14.435 --> 02:08:14.755]  Uh-oh!
[02:08:14.835 --> 02:08:15.215]  Look out!
[02:08:15.555 --> 02:08:19.418]  This is not something that should remain hidden, and I'm sure you feel the same.
[02:08:19.538 --> 02:08:23.181]  I want to do everything in my power to get as many people to view in plain sight as possible.
[02:08:23.661 --> 02:08:23.961]  Okay?
[02:08:24.602 --> 02:08:31.867]  I could go on here, but he wants very much to be able to get folks out there to see this video and start thinking outside the cage, and you go, boy!
[02:08:31.927 --> 02:08:32.827]  What else can I say?
[02:08:32.847 --> 02:08:34.408]  A couple suggestions, Matt?
[02:08:35.429 --> 02:08:37.931]  Get it onto a local cable access channel?
[02:08:38.951 --> 02:08:41.252]  You can have a screening at the library.
[02:08:41.572 --> 02:08:41.972]  Okay?
[02:08:42.112 --> 02:08:43.852]  You can publicize it at the school.
[02:08:43.912 --> 02:08:49.253]  Get together with the Student Union and say, hey look, let's have a free screening of this video.
[02:08:49.613 --> 02:08:51.034]  And get together with a couple of your friends.
[02:08:51.074 --> 02:08:54.034]  Have a meeting of people that think like you do.
[02:08:54.674 --> 02:08:55.775]  And make a battle plan.
[02:08:55.815 --> 02:08:56.535]  Make flyers.
[02:08:56.595 --> 02:08:57.335]  Put it out there.
[02:08:57.835 --> 02:08:59.435]  And you know, plan a screening of it.
[02:08:59.475 --> 02:09:00.215]  That's the way to do it.
[02:09:00.275 --> 02:09:01.696]  Grassroots guy, bottom up.
[02:09:01.896 --> 02:09:06.097]  And if anybody else has got any other suggestions, hey, bring them to the table.
[02:09:06.177 --> 02:09:07.317]  That's what this is all about.
[02:09:08.536 --> 02:09:21.867]  Now also, I have a letter here that was written by Craig, and he was responding to Gordon Farrer, who is the individual that writes for The Age, which is a newspaper in Australia.
[02:09:22.367 --> 02:09:33.616]  Now The Age, Gordon wrote a very scathing review of 9-11 in plain sight, and it was published before it was aired.
[02:09:34.156 --> 02:09:37.538]  And I believe it was in that morning's newspaper the night before it was going to be aired.
[02:09:38.139 --> 02:09:45.543]  And if people caught wind of this thing and read his review both in the newspaper and online they were very upset and understandably so.
[02:09:46.084 --> 02:09:52.808]  Now for those of you that want to see what this flap is all about we've got the entire exchange between myself and Mr. Farrar.
[02:09:52.828 --> 02:09:57.551]  Now I don't usually address individuals that slam either Joyce or me.
[02:09:57.591 --> 02:10:01.273]  I mean we try to stay on the horse because otherwise you end up wrestling in the mud.
[02:10:01.733 --> 02:10:02.874]  And that's not what we're into.
[02:10:03.414 --> 02:10:12.758]  But I did find it necessary to draw out Mr. Farrar so that he and the listenership of the program and all the readers out there.
[02:10:12.898 --> 02:10:16.000]  The new listeners we've got down in Australia are unbelievable.
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:18.941]  Thank you so much, all you folks down under.
[02:10:19.241 --> 02:10:20.922]  Thank you for joining us on the program.
[02:10:20.942 --> 02:10:22.603]  I know we've got a lot of folks out there.
[02:10:23.143 --> 02:10:27.206]  And after reading the exchange, he wrote the article, I responded to it.
[02:10:27.586 --> 02:10:33.470]  He responded to my response, and then I responded to his response of my response, and then he responded again.
[02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:37.112]  So we went back and forth about three times, and I'm done with the guy.
[02:10:37.152 --> 02:10:40.134]  I'm not going to respond anymore because he is adamantly
[02:10:40.974 --> 02:10:44.940]  And gleefully and blissfully in the cage.
[02:10:45.481 --> 02:10:46.763]  And he does not want to.
[02:10:46.783 --> 02:10:48.705]  He wants to keep all the other people in the cage.
[02:10:48.745 --> 02:10:51.810]  He will not address the issues.
[02:10:52.518 --> 02:10:57.219]  He is so wrapped up in attacking the messenger and adamantly refusing to deal with the message.
[02:10:57.499 --> 02:10:58.759]  And this is exactly the point.
[02:10:59.079 --> 02:11:04.080]  By my getting him to respond and then responding back and getting another response.
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:08.161]  He should have quit when he was ahead because he didn't just shoot himself in the leg.
[02:11:08.641 --> 02:11:12.802]  He sawed both of his legs off slowly and deliberately at this point.
[02:11:13.082 --> 02:11:14.982]  People can see exactly where he's coming from.
[02:11:15.082 --> 02:11:18.102]  Very interesting exchange and check it out at the Power Hour.
[02:11:18.422 --> 02:11:20.703]  And I also want to thank Craig if you're out there listening.
[02:11:20.803 --> 02:11:21.043]  Craig
[02:11:22.724 --> 02:11:26.887]  E is the first letter of his last name, and he's down under there.
[02:11:27.448 --> 02:11:33.432]  And I thank you so much for your lengthy response, very articulate, very intelligent response to Mr. Farrar.
[02:11:34.493 --> 02:11:49.305]  Anyway, that said, and of course for those of you that still, if you've been under a rock and you don't know anything about the 9-11 in plain sight documentary, it is just creating an unbelievable controversy around the world.
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:12:03.830]  and uh... that the powers that be are desperate to keep people from seeing this or asking the questions that we bring up in that program because the questions are valid they still stand and they will continue to stand until there is an open
[02:12:04.745 --> 02:12:22.497]  An open and free exchange of ideas and thoughts and the discussion is not influenced in any way shape or form by so-called truth seekers that want to somehow discredit or ridicule anybody that dares ask these questions like, what is the flash?
[02:12:22.978 --> 02:12:24.679]  What caused the flash?
[02:12:25.079 --> 02:12:28.802]  Was the flash a result of the pod?
[02:12:29.322 --> 02:12:30.623]  Is there a pod?
[02:12:30.883 --> 02:12:33.125]  They don't want you even talking about this stuff!
[02:12:33.826 --> 02:12:49.913]  Because if we talk about it, we just might find out that the September 11th attack and the collapse of the towers might have been a result of something other than terrorists with box cutters.
[02:12:50.313 --> 02:12:52.994]  Now that's not to say that there weren't terrorists involved.
[02:12:53.034 --> 02:12:54.114]  I've never said that.
[02:12:55.215 --> 02:12:55.455]  Okay?
[02:12:55.475 --> 02:13:03.398]  But just like the analogy that I gave many, it's too long to give now, but I gave many months ago about the unscrupulous individual
[02:13:04.031 --> 02:13:09.777]  That had clawed his way up the ladder of success and left in his wake the ruined lives of many honest people.
[02:13:10.618 --> 02:13:16.043]  And because he felt he was in competition with a guy that lived down the street, he plant bombs around his house.
[02:13:16.804 --> 02:13:20.928]  And had a button he could push anytime he wanted to blow this guy up.
[02:13:21.228 --> 02:13:26.353]  But before he did it, he hired a bunch of kids to let off some fireworks for a party he had planned.
[02:13:26.829 --> 02:13:30.432]  And as the kids let off the fireworks he pushed the button and the house blew up.
[02:13:30.792 --> 02:13:33.774]  When the firefighters and the police got there they arrested the kids.
[02:13:34.835 --> 02:13:43.200]  Now my question is, is it possible that Osama Bin Laden and the terrorists were nothing more than those kids that were hired to do a different job?
[02:13:43.881 --> 02:13:47.423]  Maybe they were involved in something very bad and I don't doubt that they were.
[02:13:48.104 --> 02:13:51.106]  But did they bring down the towers?
[02:13:52.607 --> 02:13:55.469]  Did they attack the Pentagon?
[02:13:56.423 --> 02:13:57.224]  That's the question.
[02:13:57.424 --> 02:14:05.109]  There's a whole lot more to the story of September 11th than is being brought to the table, and I think the overwhelming majority of the people of the world now realize this.
[02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:20.000]  The simple fact is, is that every piece of legislation, every military action that's been taken, and every television broadcast by these talking heads, so-called journalists on television, the likes of Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Bill O'Reilly, yeah, I want a piece of you!
[02:14:21.301 --> 02:14:21.962]  Hey!
[02:14:21.982 --> 02:14:23.423]  I want a piece of you, Bill!
[02:14:24.474 --> 02:14:34.099]  But anyway, all of these people are directly responsible for taking our country, and indeed the world, down a path that is based upon fraud.
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:42.103]  Everything is predicated on September 11th, and if we don't get to the truth about what happened on September 11th, then everything we do is based on a lie.
[02:14:42.163 --> 02:14:43.344]  We are living a lie.
[02:14:44.409 --> 02:14:45.770]  We've got to get to the truth.
[02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:56.518]  And if you're willing to sacrifice your liberty and your freedom, you better understand that they who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither liberty or security.
[02:14:56.538 --> 02:15:00.961]  If we're going to give up our rights, we better be doggone sure that we don't want them back forever.
[02:15:02.442 --> 02:15:07.146]  And we better re-examine why we were given these founding documents in the first place.
[02:15:08.655 --> 02:15:17.238]  Alright, that said, let's start going to the phones, and as I ranted, I shuffled my paper here, and I've lost my... let me see, where is it?
[02:15:17.458 --> 02:15:19.359]  Richard in New Hampshire, you're the first one up.
[02:15:19.379 --> 02:15:20.059]  Thank you, Scott.
[02:15:20.499 --> 02:15:21.219]  Richard, welcome.
[02:15:21.439 --> 02:15:22.440]  Yeah, hi Dave, how's it going?
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:26.041]  A couple points I want to bring out about our illustrious IRS.
[02:15:26.501 --> 02:15:29.602]  Last year I brought one out, and I'll bring out another one that I didn't get to.
[02:15:29.882 --> 02:15:30.162]  Okay.
[02:15:30.443 --> 02:15:37.525]  About five years ago, in the Buffalo Service Center in Buffalo, New York, some of the employees over there that were taking some of the returns
[02:15:38.086 --> 02:15:39.867]  You know, from all the movie stars?
[02:15:40.248 --> 02:15:40.508]  Yeah.
[02:15:40.728 --> 02:15:43.830]  Like, uh, oh, Julia Roberts and that.
[02:15:43.890 --> 02:15:45.751]  And what they were doing, they were putting it up on the internet.
[02:15:46.512 --> 02:15:46.892]  Oh, really?
[02:15:47.132 --> 02:15:47.713]  Oh, yeah, really.
[02:15:48.493 --> 02:15:50.315]  And, uh, nothing ever happened from that.
[02:15:50.935 --> 02:15:51.656]  No repercussions.
[02:15:52.076 --> 02:15:54.137]  Nobody, nobody, uh, got reprimanded.
[02:15:54.197 --> 02:15:56.019]  Nobody lost their jobs or anything like that.
[02:15:56.039 --> 02:15:56.779]  Huh.
[02:15:57.099 --> 02:15:58.320]  That great, great outfit, right?
[02:15:58.580 --> 02:15:59.281]  Yeah, really.
[02:15:59.661 --> 02:16:04.224]  And the other one now, which I brought up last year, is about five years ago.
[02:16:04.565 --> 02:16:06.286]  The IRS, they were running a scam.
[02:16:06.926 --> 02:16:07.807]  Believe I told you about this.
[02:16:08.789 --> 02:16:13.570]  And what they were doing back then, everybody was sending in their checks, and they were putting IRS.
[02:16:14.630 --> 02:16:17.791]  So, what some of the agents did is they opened up a checking account.
[02:16:18.551 --> 02:16:18.771]  Alright?
[02:16:18.991 --> 02:16:20.271]  In the name of I.R.
[02:16:20.291 --> 02:16:21.052]  Smith.
[02:16:21.812 --> 02:16:21.992]  Alright?
[02:16:22.532 --> 02:16:32.274]  And when anybody, uh, taxpayers sent in their checks saying IRS, well what they did is they just put a, you know, period after the I, a period after the R, and they just filled in Smith.
[02:16:32.794 --> 02:16:32.974]  Alright?
[02:16:33.914 --> 02:16:37.955]  And they stole three million dollars.
[02:16:39.329 --> 02:16:41.669]  Three million dollars a day they stole, right?
[02:16:42.450 --> 02:16:51.151]  Now, they had people out there, their checks weren't being cleared and stuff like that, and of course they had all kinds of fees and penalties and fines and different things, right?
[02:16:51.851 --> 02:16:59.013]  Not a single IRS agent that was involved in this ever got prosecuted, and not a single one of them ever went to prison.
[02:16:59.473 --> 02:17:00.393]  Wow.
[02:17:00.413 --> 02:17:04.074]  This is what we're dealing with out there when we're dealing with the IRS.
[02:17:05.134 --> 02:17:05.274]  Yeah.
[02:17:06.894 --> 02:17:08.595]  You know, I don't know.
[02:17:08.655 --> 02:17:16.760]  It just boggles the mind how the people, you know, they just stood back and they let these government agencies like this just run roughshod over us.
[02:17:17.181 --> 02:17:17.821]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:18.061 --> 02:17:18.542]  It really is.
[02:17:18.902 --> 02:17:19.822]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:20.203 --> 02:17:22.924]  Just bringing yet another puzzle piece to the table.
[02:17:23.445 --> 02:17:26.547]  If we can all work together, maybe we'll figure out what the picture's going to be.
[02:17:26.987 --> 02:17:27.427]  I don't know.
[02:17:28.428 --> 02:17:31.890]  I don't know if we want to see what the final picture's going to be, because I think we all know what it is.
[02:17:33.308 --> 02:17:34.349]  Alright, we're going to take our break.
[02:17:34.369 --> 02:17:36.931]  We'll be back and we've got a first timer on the line.
[02:17:36.951 --> 02:17:38.472]  Hey, more first timers coming on board.
[02:17:38.572 --> 02:17:38.912]  Told you.
[02:17:39.073 --> 02:17:40.133]  Told you we've got new listeners.
[02:17:40.634 --> 02:17:41.334]  You stay right there.
[02:17:41.374 --> 02:17:42.175]  We'll be back.
[02:17:42.195 --> 02:17:42.335]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:42.435 --> 02:17:49.941]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[02:17:50.501 --> 02:17:52.243]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?

[02:18:47.561 --> 02:18:48.621]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.022 --> 02:18:54.504]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.064 --> 02:18:55.564]  That's right.
[02:18:55.884 --> 02:18:58.165]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:59.566 --> 02:19:05.648]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.218 --> 02:19:13.924]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.344 --> 02:19:19.207]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.

[02:21:23.798 --> 02:21:25.880]  That's 677-817-9829, and order Vitamir mouthwash and toothpaste today.
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:28.362]  He'll be glad you did, and so will that special someone in your life.
[02:21:33.527 --> 02:21:37.951]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Vitamir oral hygiene products today.
[02:21:38.271 --> 02:21:41.794]  Try Vitamir and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[02:22:05.894 --> 02:22:09.398]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday morning edition of the Power Hour.
[02:22:09.438 --> 02:22:10.339]  This is Dave and Joyce.
[02:22:10.379 --> 02:22:13.221]  Coming up on 25 minutes past the hour.
[02:22:13.382 --> 02:22:14.303]  I can't help it, folks.
[02:22:14.323 --> 02:22:16.365]  When I hear music like this, it makes me feel... Ah!
[02:22:19.408 --> 02:22:20.128]  Just wonderful.
[02:22:20.329 --> 02:22:21.169]  Just wonderful.
[02:22:21.189 --> 02:22:23.452]  Chris Feeley, you go, boy.
[02:22:23.472 --> 02:22:26.415]  The album is not all who wander are lost.
[02:22:26.475 --> 02:22:27.756]  It's one of my favorite albums.
[02:22:27.836 --> 02:22:28.657]  Just good stuff.
[02:22:34.002 --> 02:22:38.226]  Alright, we're going to have open lines.
[02:22:38.246 --> 02:22:41.030]  1-800-259-9231 is the phone number, but you can't dial it now, because guess what?
[02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:43.292]  They're all full.
[02:22:43.312 --> 02:22:50.461]  And I'm hoping, I am hoping against hope that we can inspire folks, not just to understand what's going on.
[02:22:50.481 --> 02:22:53.144]  That's not inspiration, that's education.
[02:22:53.504 --> 02:22:58.151]  But I want folks to be able to do exactly what Howard Beale had inspired them to do.
[02:22:58.211 --> 02:23:02.156]  I want y'all to, you know, that's why we end the program and scream, We Will Not Stop.
[02:23:02.236 --> 02:23:04.740]  Well, Howard Beale got everybody to scream.
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:06.562]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it!
[02:23:07.023 --> 02:23:07.744]  How do you feel?
[02:23:07.764 --> 02:23:08.405]  We're ready!
[02:23:12.836 --> 02:23:14.639]  We want that same sentiment, folks.
[02:23:14.719 --> 02:23:20.927]  We want to get everybody, yo, okay, fine, if anger is what it's going to take to get people off a dead center, well then so be it.
[02:23:21.027 --> 02:23:24.692]  That's, you know, I mean, I hate to generate anger and hate and all that kind of stuff.
[02:23:24.772 --> 02:23:25.433]  I don't like hate.
[02:23:25.513 --> 02:23:26.194]  Hate's not good.
[02:23:26.334 --> 02:23:26.875]  Hate is bad.
[02:23:27.115 --> 02:23:27.496]  Hate bad.
[02:23:27.996 --> 02:23:50.975]  But we've got to do something to get folks to rediscover their heritage, their responsibility, and their duty as patriotic Americans to roll up their sleeves, break a sweat, get their fingernails dirty, and realize it is your responsibility to get out there and tend to the garden so that the seeds of liberty will continue to flourish, if they haven't died altogether.
[02:23:51.436 --> 02:23:53.938]  Alright, we have a first timer on the line.
[02:23:54.887 --> 02:23:56.829]  Tim, in Michigan, welcome aboard.
[02:23:56.889 --> 02:23:57.729]  Thank you for calling.
[02:23:57.749 --> 02:23:58.069]  Welcome.
[02:23:58.410 --> 02:23:58.630]  Hi.
[02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:09.918]  You know, the part from that movie you ought to be playing is Ned Beatty taking Howard Eele into that big room and telling him, you do not mess with the primal forces of nature.
[02:24:09.958 --> 02:24:10.519]  That's right.
[02:24:10.539 --> 02:24:11.039]  Very good.
[02:24:11.079 --> 02:24:13.801]  Yeah, we played that particular clip yesterday.
[02:24:14.082 --> 02:24:15.302]  Oh, I didn't get to hear it.
[02:24:15.383 --> 02:24:15.983]  I don't know why.
[02:24:16.203 --> 02:24:16.744]  Oh, you want me?
[02:24:16.824 --> 02:24:19.345]  I'll play a portion of that at the bottom of the hour.
[02:24:19.365 --> 02:24:20.266]  That would be great.
[02:24:20.346 --> 02:24:22.608]  I'm calling about this whole bankruptcy debt
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:23.340]  Yeah.
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:23.500]  Yeah.
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:23.600]  Yeah.
[02:24:49.434 --> 02:25:01.538]  People wake up, you know, the founder of WHRI was a pastor called Lester Sumrall, and he, I watched him on the TV talking about, you made a deal with these people and you owe them the money.
[02:25:02.299 --> 02:25:11.002]  You know, I can understand people who are raising kids and they have to have certain things in their home in order to do things properly, but I mean, there is a limit.
[02:25:11.062 --> 02:25:17.684]  I mean, because they tell you that this year bath towels are green or burgundy, doesn't mean you have to go out and do that.
[02:25:18.303 --> 02:25:18.543]  Right.
[02:25:18.563 --> 02:25:18.764]  Right.
[02:25:18.784 --> 02:25:18.944]  Right.
[02:25:37.552 --> 02:25:38.632]  That's right.
[02:25:40.113 --> 02:25:43.014]  You have to ask the question, how much is enough?
[02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:44.054]  How much is too much?
[02:25:44.254 --> 02:25:45.015]  Exactly.
[02:25:45.615 --> 02:25:50.697]  So folks say, wait a second, if you start going down that road, then you're condemning capitalism.
[02:25:50.777 --> 02:25:51.497]  So no, I'm not.
[02:25:51.617 --> 02:25:54.218]  I think everybody should be able to make as much money as they want to.
[02:25:54.258 --> 02:25:56.639]  But the point is, how much do you want to make?
[02:25:56.679 --> 02:25:57.759]  How much do you need to make?
[02:25:58.059 --> 02:25:59.420]  And how much do you have to make?
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:12.547]  I mean, it's sort of like standing in a buffet line, and the guy in front of you starts scooping so much food on his plate, it goes to the floor, and then it's up to his ankles and up to his knees, and he's just taking it because he can.
[02:26:12.567 --> 02:26:13.508]  Right, right.
[02:26:13.808 --> 02:26:16.349]  I mean, that doesn't leave anything left for anybody else.
[02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:18.871]  I mean, that's just flat-out greed.
[02:26:19.571 --> 02:26:20.832]  Yeah, and you know something else?
[02:26:20.952 --> 02:26:25.075]  I heard this years and years ago on, I believe it was Tom Valentine.
[02:26:25.115 --> 02:26:27.316]  They were talking about the whole money situation.
[02:26:28.497 --> 02:26:30.378]  What we call money is called notes.
[02:26:30.768 --> 02:26:44.176]  Federal Reserve notes, and they're based in, I think they said, insurance law, and anything purchased with those notes actually belongs to the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:26:44.716 --> 02:26:45.737]  That's what I've heard, yeah.
[02:26:45.797 --> 02:26:49.779]  Yeah, so they own whatever you bought with their notes.
[02:26:50.739 --> 02:26:55.162]  So, you know, we're in a really sticky situation with that.
[02:26:55.732 --> 02:26:59.674]  Yeah, well, you see, I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:26:59.714 --> 02:27:07.057]  I mean, I would love to think that we could defeat these monsters, but sometimes I feel that the only way out of this mess is to allow them to collapse under the weight of their own corruption.
[02:27:07.237 --> 02:27:08.817]  I think that's how it's going to happen.
[02:27:08.897 --> 02:27:09.538]  I think so, too.
[02:27:09.978 --> 02:27:12.419]  They're going to say, we own it all anyway.
[02:27:13.326 --> 02:27:14.967]  And we're leasing it to you.
[02:27:15.267 --> 02:27:16.208]  Hey Tim, we've got to go.
[02:27:16.268 --> 02:27:17.589]  Bottom of the hour is upon us.
[02:27:17.609 --> 02:27:18.609]  How do you hear the program?
[02:27:19.410 --> 02:27:21.311]  W-H-R-I-N-W-W-C-R-I.
[02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:21.911]  Wonderful.
[02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:22.572]  Hey, thank you.
[02:27:22.632 --> 02:27:23.972]  I'm so glad to have you aboard.
[02:27:23.992 --> 02:27:25.533]  Spread the word!
[02:27:25.553 --> 02:27:30.176]  Alright, bottom of the hour break is here.
[02:27:30.196 --> 02:27:30.336]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:30.356 --> 02:27:34.499]  When we get back, I'll play some of that speech that Ned Bitty gave to Howard Field.
[02:27:34.519 --> 02:27:36.620]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:41.523]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.502 --> 02:27:51.143]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[02:27:51.203 --> 02:27:51.923]  have diabetes.
[02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:59.184]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:27:59.344 --> 02:28:03.865]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:28:04.085 --> 02:28:06.906]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[02:28:45.939 --> 02:28:48.020]  Cool weather brings cool cars!
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.341]  I don't think so.
[02:28:49.661 --> 02:28:53.302]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:28:53.662 --> 02:28:54.683]  Here's your to-do.
[02:28:54.903 --> 02:28:57.664]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:28:57.864 --> 02:29:03.507]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:29:03.887 --> 02:29:08.029]  The BG chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[02:29:08.269 --> 02:29:13.111]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to BGfindashop.com.
[02:29:13.331 --> 02:29:15.052]  That's BGfindashop.com.
[02:29:16.050 --> 02:29:19.651]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[02:29:19.831 --> 02:29:23.733]  Find the cleanest shop in town where cleaning is top priority.
[02:29:23.893 --> 02:29:27.414]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[02:29:27.794 --> 02:29:35.377]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[02:29:35.637 --> 02:29:38.918]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[02:29:39.338 --> 02:29:42.979]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:29:43.239 --> 02:29:44.980]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:29:49.266 --> 02:29:54.529]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[02:29:57.311 --> 02:30:05.696]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[02:30:06.357 --> 02:30:13.801]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[02:30:14.302 --> 02:30:16.023]  This is real, not science fiction.
[02:30:16.733 --> 02:30:25.420]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[02:30:27.902 --> 02:30:37.549]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:41.973]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[02:30:48.682 --> 02:30:49.402]  Not us, guys!
[02:30:49.462 --> 02:30:50.923]  Hey, you guys paid to listen?
[02:30:51.083 --> 02:30:53.404]  Are you paying attention?
[02:30:53.444 --> 02:30:54.404]  We're the good guys.
[02:30:54.464 --> 02:30:56.745]  You take an order from the bad guys.
[02:31:17.398 --> 02:31:19.603]  You want to find out who the real bad guys are?
[02:31:19.623 --> 02:31:20.204]  Hmm?
[02:31:20.244 --> 02:31:21.487]  Hey, turn the on switch.
[02:31:21.547 --> 02:31:22.349]  Where's the remote?
[02:31:26.425 --> 02:31:29.886]  Alright, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday morning edition of the Power Hour.
[02:31:29.926 --> 02:31:33.547]  This is Dave von Kleist and Joyce Riley, and yeah, a quick promotion here.
[02:31:33.607 --> 02:31:34.888]  There's a lot of folks out there.
[02:31:34.908 --> 02:31:36.328]  We've got a couple of new listeners.
[02:31:36.408 --> 02:31:41.170]  Our last caller, Tim up there in Michigan, how's he listening?
[02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:43.131]  He's listening on WHRI.
[02:31:43.651 --> 02:31:51.253]  And the current frequency that comes in around here, we're in the Midwest here in Missouri, 11.785, usually comes in pretty doggone good.
[02:31:51.694 --> 02:31:54.715]  And I'll tell you right now that we can do a test if I say something.
[02:31:55.675 --> 02:31:55.895]  Hello?
[02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:57.661]  You hear that echo?
[02:31:58.501 --> 02:32:17.097]  Okay, that echo is created because when I talk into this microphone, it takes about, I don't know, a quarter of a second or almost a half a second for my voice to go all the way up to Minneapolis, down to the transmitter, up into space, bounce down to the receiver at WHRI, goes out on the international shortwave and comes back in my radio.
[02:32:18.198 --> 02:32:21.280]  A trip of probably about 38,000 miles.
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:22.641]  Something ridiculous like that.
[02:32:23.041 --> 02:32:27.725]  But anyway, the point is that this little radio that we got, the Mini 300, it is a pocket radio.
[02:32:28.085 --> 02:32:29.006]  Fits in your shirt pocket.
[02:32:29.386 --> 02:32:30.767]  Got a little antenna on it, of course.
[02:32:31.068 --> 02:32:33.189]  And this thing's got great reception.
[02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:35.051]  It is a really neat piece to have.
[02:32:35.411 --> 02:32:41.356]  And you probably, once you try one of these, you're going to want to have one in the car, one out in the garage, one in the house.
[02:32:41.856 --> 02:32:44.218]  And they're only $29.95 plus the shipping.
[02:32:44.238 --> 02:32:49.541]  They come with a little pouch with a belt loop on it, so you can keep it with you at all times.
[02:32:50.182 --> 02:32:51.403]  And you can get yours by calling 877-817-9829.
[02:32:51.423 --> 02:32:51.823]  Again, that's 877-817-9829.
[02:32:51.843 --> 02:32:52.724]  $29.95 plus the shipping.
[02:32:52.744 --> 02:32:55.445]  The Grindig Mini 300 is just a really cool little shortwave.
[02:32:55.465 --> 02:32:59.388]  Whether you have another shortwave or not, you know a lot of you folks have Sanjins.
[02:32:59.428 --> 02:33:00.609]  Some of you have big old Kenwoods.
[02:33:11.518 --> 02:33:14.108]  You know, but hey, you definitely want to have one of these.
[02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:16.196]  Okay, now before we get back to the phones...
[02:33:16.992 --> 02:33:23.757]  Yeah, I have this clip ready here, because this, again, and I hate to be banging the drum about this movie, Network, but it is so important.
[02:33:23.777 --> 02:33:27.480]  It's sort of like the movie Braveheart, or the movie The Patriot, you know?
[02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:34.225]  These are movies that you need to watch every once in a while, just to smack reality right between your eyes, and mine as well.
[02:33:35.106 --> 02:33:41.771]  So we don't forget about what we have learned, because if you forget your history, you're destined to repeat it.
[02:33:42.131 --> 02:33:43.792]  This movie came out 30 years ago, 1976,
[02:33:46.434 --> 02:33:52.336]  And the message in this movie about the control of the media is truer now than it was then.
[02:33:52.456 --> 02:33:57.198]  I had no idea when I saw this movie how significant it was.
[02:33:57.418 --> 02:34:01.520]  And when I saw it again, it was on television about two months ago.
[02:34:02.268 --> 02:34:06.331]  And I only caught the last half hour, and I said, oh my gosh, I'd forgotten all about that.
[02:34:06.891 --> 02:34:13.235]  So anyway, I recently obtained a copy, and I watched it the other night, and I tell you, this is must viewing.
[02:34:13.275 --> 02:34:15.457]  Go to your video store, get a copy of this.
[02:34:15.477 --> 02:34:17.098]  I'm going to play a clip in this scene.
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:26.429]  Howard Beale, who is the news anchor, who has all of a sudden found this new purpose in life in spreading this message of common sense.
[02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:31.777]  At one point he goes on his program and he says, hey, the Arabs are taking over the corporations.
[02:34:31.797 --> 02:34:35.662]  They're taking over our corporation that owns this network and we've got to stop them.
[02:34:36.272 --> 02:34:40.255]  Well, the owner of the corporation calls Mr. Beale into his office.
[02:34:40.295 --> 02:34:41.396]  He's not real happy.
[02:34:41.796 --> 02:34:52.964]  He sits Mr. Beale down, and he closes the curtain, and as the room darkens, he walks to the end of the long table to address Mr. Beale in private, and he speaks.
[02:34:53.184 --> 02:34:54.245]  And here's part of his speech.
[02:35:01.132 --> 02:35:08.076]  You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Neal, and I won't have it!
[02:35:08.936 --> 02:35:09.517]  Is that clear?
[02:35:10.837 --> 02:35:13.078]  You think you've merely stopped a business deal?
[02:35:13.299 --> 02:35:14.679]  That is not the case!
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:19.022]  The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back!
[02:35:20.322 --> 02:35:24.885]  It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity, it is ecological balance!
[02:35:26.946 --> 02:35:32.709]  You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples.
[02:35:33.009 --> 02:35:33.950]  There are no nations.
[02:35:34.210 --> 02:35:35.050]  There are no peoples.
[02:35:35.370 --> 02:35:36.291]  There are no Russians.
[02:35:36.491 --> 02:35:37.391]  There are no Arabs.
[02:35:37.632 --> 02:35:38.832]  There are no Third Worlds.
[02:35:38.872 --> 02:35:39.853]  There is no West.
[02:35:40.393 --> 02:35:45.095]  There is only one holistic system of systems.
[02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:53.280]  One vast and inmane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars.
[02:35:54.298 --> 02:36:02.361]  Petrodollars, Electrodollars, Multidollars, Reichmarks, Rings, Rubles, Pounds, and Shekels.
[02:36:04.722 --> 02:36:12.045]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[02:36:13.606 --> 02:36:17.647]  That is the natural order of things today.
[02:36:19.328 --> 02:36:21.989]  That is the atomic
[02:36:23.268 --> 02:36:29.550]  And sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today!
[02:36:31.631 --> 02:36:37.072]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!
[02:36:38.873 --> 02:36:43.414]  And you will atone!
[02:36:44.775 --> 02:36:45.895]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[02:36:47.077 --> 02:36:49.838]  I'm going to stop it there, because it gets better.
[02:36:50.238 --> 02:36:56.139]  And if you want to see it, you're going to have to get a copy of this film, Network.
[02:36:57.159 --> 02:36:59.919]  Anyway, man, you talk about the corporate board.
[02:36:59.959 --> 02:37:02.420]  You talk about a disease of the mind.
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.241]  Yes, money makes the world go round, but money is not the purpose of life.
[02:37:08.061 --> 02:37:10.821]  Love is the purpose of life.
[02:37:12.041 --> 02:37:13.782]  You can't take it with you.
[02:37:13.862 --> 02:37:15.402]  How many times have we all heard that?
[02:37:16.863 --> 02:37:24.066]  However, it was said, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.
[02:37:24.726 --> 02:37:32.169]  I'm not going to tell you who made that particular statement, because some of you might get upset, because you're more worried about the messenger than you are the message.
[02:37:33.288 --> 02:37:34.188]  We're gonna go to the phones.
[02:37:34.248 --> 02:37:39.090]  Harry in Texas, you're first up and I have to apologize for having to let you go the other day.
[02:37:39.130 --> 02:37:42.131]  It's just we flat ran out of time and that's the way it works.
[02:37:42.171 --> 02:37:43.151]  Harry, thank you for calling.
[02:37:43.171 --> 02:37:43.651]  You're on the air.
[02:37:44.011 --> 02:37:45.372]  Okay, good morning, Dave.
[02:37:45.412 --> 02:37:46.552]  Good morning, good to hear your voice.
[02:37:46.632 --> 02:37:47.253]  Yeah, right.
[02:37:47.853 --> 02:37:53.535]  Dave, this guy that you had on a couple of days ago that said he's mad as hell.
[02:37:54.155 --> 02:37:56.235]  That was a terrific audio clip.
[02:37:56.555 --> 02:37:58.176]  Yeah, that's from the movie I was just talking about.
[02:37:58.196 --> 02:38:01.097]  That's the... Okay, well, here's my point.
[02:38:02.133 --> 02:38:05.754]  What we've got to do is get the people mad.
[02:38:06.734 --> 02:38:08.835]  And you are in a good position to do it.
[02:38:09.195 --> 02:38:13.676]  Just like this guy in that audio clip you had there.
[02:38:14.237 --> 02:38:15.757]  We're beating around the bush.
[02:38:15.917 --> 02:38:17.337]  You know there's an old saying.
[02:38:18.058 --> 02:38:21.839]  No great nation was ever saved by good people.
[02:38:22.439 --> 02:38:26.600]  Because good people will not go to the extent to save it.
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:29.601]  And that's our situation right now.
[02:38:31.823 --> 02:38:41.340]  We've got to get these people mad and you know what the best thing to do that could get them mad and a lot of people get hurt but by golly I think it's worth it.
[02:38:41.921 --> 02:38:44.365]  If we had a financial collapse in this country
[02:38:44.887 --> 02:38:49.331]  We could separate the wheat from the chaff and take this country back.
[02:38:49.371 --> 02:38:50.032]  Maybe so.
[02:38:50.232 --> 02:38:50.672]  I don't know.
[02:38:50.712 --> 02:38:52.474]  But on the other hand, it could go the other way.
[02:38:52.794 --> 02:38:53.155]  It could.
[02:38:53.395 --> 02:38:59.581]  It could throw all of mankind into a desperate and hopeless slavery situation.
[02:38:59.901 --> 02:39:00.742]  It could, yes.
[02:39:00.862 --> 02:39:03.444]  But the possibility is, this is America.
[02:39:03.484 --> 02:39:05.366]  This is not a third world country.
[02:39:06.064 --> 02:39:13.786]  We've got some brains here, but we don't have enough red-blooded Americans to get mad enough to take this country over.
[02:39:14.026 --> 02:39:20.088]  Well, we do, but we've got to figure out a way to get them mad, and that's why I've been saying, Harry, you've been with us for a long time.
[02:39:20.128 --> 02:39:35.653]  You've been a listener of The Power Hour for many years, and you've heard me say numerous times that I'm sorry, that it seems to me that the only way to get Americans off of their big, fat, pimple-covered, blood, you know, bedsore butts
[02:39:36.174 --> 02:39:44.510]  Is to take away their remote control, cancel the football game and a beer delivery, and let them eat something other than pizza.
[02:39:45.171 --> 02:39:48.093]  Well, if that'll get them mad, that's what I would do then.
[02:39:49.214 --> 02:39:50.996]  Well, then let's go!
[02:39:51.516 --> 02:39:55.740]  You know, what do we do to get these people to grab the pitchforks and the torches and storm the castle?
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:56.861]  Get them mad!
[02:39:56.941 --> 02:39:58.182]  Get them mad!
[02:39:58.422 --> 02:40:01.084]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!
[02:40:01.384 --> 02:40:05.528]  Alright, that's what we gotta convey to all these people, to take this country over.
[02:40:05.788 --> 02:40:07.389]  God bless you and Joyce, Dave.
[02:40:07.549 --> 02:40:08.030]  Thank you.
[02:40:08.050 --> 02:40:08.850]  This was good work.
[02:40:08.970 --> 02:40:10.011]  You go, boy!
[02:40:10.071 --> 02:40:10.592]  Let's go!
[02:40:10.732 --> 02:40:10.932]  Woo!
[02:40:11.032 --> 02:40:11.232]  Woo!
[02:40:11.352 --> 02:40:11.553]  Woo!
[02:40:11.673 --> 02:40:11.733]  Woo!
[02:40:12.293 --> 02:40:13.753]  All right, thanks for the call, Harry.
[02:40:13.853 --> 02:40:17.834]  Joe in Arkansas, I hope you're mad as hell and you're not going to take it anymore.
[02:40:17.854 --> 02:40:19.814]  Well, I'm mad, yeah.
[02:40:19.875 --> 02:40:21.355]  I can't seem to get other people mad though.
[02:40:22.335 --> 02:40:23.795]  I try, but they don't seem to get mad.
[02:40:24.675 --> 02:40:26.156]  Even though I give them lots of good reasons to.
[02:40:27.256 --> 02:40:30.797]  But anyway, I have two things I'd like to tell you about briefly.
[02:40:30.817 --> 02:40:31.357]  All right.
[02:40:31.417 --> 02:40:37.858]  And first is that yesterday I had a very interesting visit with a woman from Huntsville, Arkansas, who's become quite a famous author.
[02:40:38.157 --> 02:40:38.877]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:41:02.777 --> 02:41:04.979]  And so here, and she's not particularly political.
[02:41:05.019 --> 02:41:06.260]  Her books are not about politics.
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:11.104]  She's never been a person that's interested in politics or conspiracy theories or things like that very much.
[02:41:12.265 --> 02:41:13.606]  But here she was telling me.
[02:41:14.346 --> 02:41:20.652]  She told me, very matter-of-factly, everything that our media and our government tell us about the rest of the world is a total lie.
[02:41:21.792 --> 02:41:27.197]  And she says this country is the most hated country in the world now because of what our government is doing.
[02:41:28.058 --> 02:41:29.919]  And she told me that life in this country
[02:41:32.791 --> 02:41:36.913]  Is nowhere near as good as Americans are propaganda to believe.
[02:41:36.933 --> 02:41:43.836]  You know, from what she said, it sounded to her like she thought that people in Moscow and Kiev now have a better life than people in America.
[02:41:44.777 --> 02:41:47.558]  And she said life was particularly good in Dubai and Saudi Arabia.
[02:41:48.238 --> 02:41:51.400]  The government there has a lot of money and is doing a lot of good things to help the people with the money.
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:53.541]  So that was very interesting, I thought.
[02:41:54.381 --> 02:41:56.702]  And she was also telling me about the bird flu.
[02:41:56.782 --> 02:41:59.023]  And she also told me that the bird flu is a complete hoax.
[02:42:01.516 --> 02:42:11.799]  That the wild birds don't get it, and the only birds that do are these domesticated birds that are kept in horribly unsanitary conditions, and that the people can't get it unless they have intimate contact with these birds.
[02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:17.761]  And so she said that the whole idea that the world is in danger from birds is a complete hoax.
[02:42:17.801 --> 02:42:20.342]  This is what she's learned from traveling around the rest of the world.
[02:42:21.042 --> 02:42:23.083]  So I thought it was a very interesting conversation.
[02:42:23.584 --> 02:42:28.766]  Well, sounds to me like some of the things we've talked about on this program are right along those lines.
[02:42:29.027 --> 02:42:31.608]  And she's never heard your program, but she's saying the same thing.
[02:42:32.068 --> 02:42:33.188]  I'll be doggone.
[02:42:34.249 --> 02:42:34.609]  Interesting.
[02:42:34.649 --> 02:42:35.590]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:37.110]  There's one other thing I'd like to bring up.
[02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:38.031]  Please, go ahead.
[02:42:38.111 --> 02:42:42.393]  Okay, if somebody knows more about the law about this, I would really like to hear from them.
[02:42:42.693 --> 02:42:43.173]  And that's this.
[02:42:43.873 --> 02:42:47.315]  Some time ago, I guess about a year and a half ago, a friend of mine told me that if
[02:42:47.881 --> 02:43:08.908]  When I got a check and went to deposit it in my bank account, if instead of signing my name on the back of it to endorse it, like we're always taught to do, if I would just print, for deposit only, and then put it in my bank account, then it could not be counted as income that the IRS could, you know, say was my income that I should pay taxes on.
[02:43:09.189 --> 02:43:09.649]  Oh, really?
[02:43:09.949 --> 02:43:10.169]  Yeah.
[02:43:10.489 --> 02:43:11.389]  And so I started doing it.
[02:43:11.469 --> 02:43:14.130]  So I started wondering, well, I wonder what they're going to do with the bank if I do this.
[02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:16.051]  But anyway, next time I got a check,
[02:43:16.755 --> 02:43:17.356]  Thank you for watching.
[02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:35.361]  Which is what I've told you, but if there's anybody else that knows more about that, I sure would be interested in hearing about it.
[02:43:35.461 --> 02:43:36.562]  Well, that's really interesting.
[02:43:36.662 --> 02:43:37.482]  Well, thank you for that.
[02:43:37.982 --> 02:43:41.903]  Well, you just put it out there, so we'll find out if there's any truth to that.
[02:43:42.424 --> 02:43:43.664]  Okay, I appreciate that.
[02:43:43.724 --> 02:43:45.605]  Let's go to Michigan.
[02:43:45.625 --> 02:43:47.505]  So, Anna Marie, welcome aboard.
[02:43:47.545 --> 02:43:48.085]  You're on the air.
[02:43:49.126 --> 02:43:49.526]  Hello.
[02:43:49.786 --> 02:43:50.146]  Well, hello.
[02:43:50.166 --> 02:43:51.446]  Am I a first-time caller?
[02:43:51.667 --> 02:43:52.587]  You're a first-timer?
[02:43:52.827 --> 02:43:53.507]  Yes, I am.
[02:43:53.967 --> 02:43:55.068]  Alright, welcome aboard.
[02:43:55.108 --> 02:43:56.148]  How do you hear the program?
[02:43:56.887 --> 02:43:58.228]  Of WHRI.
[02:43:58.368 --> 02:43:59.049]  Wonderful!
[02:43:59.369 --> 02:44:02.371]  And what prompted you to give us a call this fine morning, my dear?
[02:44:02.572 --> 02:44:12.579]  Well, your gentleman that you had on today said that the new laws were supposed to be talked over on 9-11.
[02:44:12.819 --> 02:44:13.200]  Yeah.
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:14.381]  Okay.
[02:44:14.941 --> 02:44:15.542]  Yeah.
[02:44:16.182 --> 02:44:19.865]  The planes hit the financial section of New York.
[02:44:21.606 --> 02:44:23.728]  Was that two birds with one stone?
[02:44:25.649 --> 02:44:26.170]  Could be.
[02:44:27.154 --> 02:44:27.936]  Sure, why not?
[02:44:29.478 --> 02:44:29.839]  I don't know.
[02:44:29.859 --> 02:44:33.365]  You know, that was the first thing that popped into my mind.
[02:44:33.445 --> 02:44:34.647]  It was the financial section.
[02:44:35.588 --> 02:44:40.196]  Yeah, I'm sure that there were several birds with one stone in this particular issue.
[02:44:40.859 --> 02:44:50.664]  I think that the idea that Larry Silverstein had himself a piece of real estate that was gushing money, just losing money, month after month.
[02:44:50.724 --> 02:45:00.210]  I mean, from what I understand from William Rodriguez, who was in charge of maintenance there at the Trade Center, he told me that the Trade Center was sitting at approximately a 65% occupancy.
[02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:06.273]  Which is like, you stop and think about the amount of money that they would be charging for office rentals
[02:45:07.094 --> 02:45:09.254]  And there's 35% vacancy.
[02:45:09.294 --> 02:45:15.076]  My gosh, they were losing tons, millions and millions of dollars every month.
[02:45:16.136 --> 02:45:19.537]  How would they get out of this particular financial albatross?
[02:45:19.737 --> 02:45:20.417]  Bankruptcy.
[02:45:20.877 --> 02:45:23.578]  Well, either bankruptcy, but how do they get rid of the buildings?
[02:45:23.798 --> 02:45:26.478]  In every other situation, well, you blow it up and bring them down.
[02:45:26.498 --> 02:45:27.338]  Right.
[02:45:27.438 --> 02:45:29.499]  Okay, but you can't do that in New York.
[02:45:29.539 --> 02:45:30.579]  I mean, it's too congested.
[02:45:30.599 --> 02:45:34.820]  You can't, you know, raise a pair of towers because they're losing money.
[02:45:35.976 --> 02:45:36.917]  How are you going to bring them down?
[02:45:36.957 --> 02:45:39.478]  You can't, you know, dismantle them.
[02:45:39.498 --> 02:45:44.541]  They cost five times as much to dismantle buildings of that size, and it would be to build brand new ones.
[02:45:44.681 --> 02:45:45.881]  So you can't dismantle them.
[02:45:46.181 --> 02:45:48.363]  You can't tear them down or blow them up.
[02:45:49.123 --> 02:45:49.703]  But they did.
[02:45:50.564 --> 02:45:53.925]  Well, yeah, but you see, they didn't do it like a planned one.
[02:45:54.446 --> 02:45:56.427]  The liability would have been horrendous.
[02:45:56.727 --> 02:45:58.708]  It had to be an accident.
[02:45:59.389 --> 02:46:00.130]  It had to be!
[02:46:00.370 --> 02:46:08.255]  That's the only way that they could bring down the Trade Center Towers was to either have it an accident or have it an attack.
[02:46:08.715 --> 02:46:09.756]  That's the only way!
[02:46:10.857 --> 02:46:16.461]  And what better way to get rid of an albatross than to have an attack and blame it on somebody else?
[02:46:16.581 --> 02:46:17.521]  Boy, that keeps getting worse!
[02:46:17.701 --> 02:46:20.483]  Now is that or is that not several birds with one stone?
[02:46:20.723 --> 02:46:20.864]  Yep!
[02:46:21.444 --> 02:46:21.844]  Thank you!
[02:46:23.105 --> 02:46:24.386]  Welcome to the Power Team, Darryl.
[02:46:24.406 --> 02:46:25.927]  I hope to hear from you again in the near future.
[02:46:26.562 --> 02:46:27.022]  Good deal.
[02:46:27.323 --> 02:46:29.884]  Let's go to Nina in Pennsylvania.
[02:46:30.165 --> 02:46:31.025]  Long time listener.
[02:46:31.446 --> 02:46:32.086]  How you doing, dear?
[02:46:32.306 --> 02:46:34.588]  Oh, I'm doing great and I'm more than mad.
[02:46:34.748 --> 02:46:35.869]  I've been mad for years.
[02:46:35.949 --> 02:46:37.510]  You go, girl!
[02:46:37.550 --> 02:46:38.531]  You better believe it.
[02:46:38.571 --> 02:46:40.072]  I've been mad for many years.
[02:46:40.172 --> 02:46:46.096]  But first of all, I would encourage everyone here in eastern Pennsylvania to get their oregason and take it.
[02:46:46.116 --> 02:46:49.819]  The chemtrails this morning, I can't even describe them.
[02:46:50.099 --> 02:46:50.920]  It's so bad.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:53.942]  The sky was blue when the sun first came up.
[02:46:54.122 --> 02:46:55.343]  It is totally gray.
[02:46:55.894 --> 02:46:57.795]  I have never seen so many chemtrails.
[02:46:58.636 --> 02:47:00.497]  And I really think they're stepping it up.
[02:47:00.817 --> 02:47:01.198]  I do.
[02:47:01.438 --> 02:47:05.741]  I think so too, because we've been getting calls from all over the country, everywhere.
[02:47:05.801 --> 02:47:10.424]  I mean, we always get people telling us about the chemtrails, and it's almost a yawner at this point.
[02:47:10.444 --> 02:47:11.885]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:12.085 --> 02:47:16.028]  Oh, look Joyce, we got another envelope full of pictures of chemtrails here.
[02:47:16.408 --> 02:47:20.391]  I mean, we get pictures every week from people all over the country.
[02:47:20.771 --> 02:47:24.914]  But what has happened in the past week, you're absolutely right, the phone calls are crazy.
[02:47:25.569 --> 02:47:28.790]  The chemtrails were just amazing around here.
[02:47:28.811 --> 02:47:29.891]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[02:47:29.971 --> 02:47:32.372]  I can feel it in my throat, and I'm all congested.
[02:47:32.412 --> 02:47:33.653]  I'm taking that oregano.
[02:47:33.673 --> 02:47:37.534]  So everybody take advantage of the 20% off and get your oregano today.
[02:47:37.574 --> 02:47:38.595]  Well, thank you, dear.
[02:47:39.035 --> 02:47:40.676]  But anyway, that's not what I called about.
[02:47:40.716 --> 02:47:43.677]  Well, you better hurry with what you called about, because we've got less than a minute.
[02:47:43.717 --> 02:47:43.877]  Go.
[02:47:43.977 --> 02:47:46.819]  Okay, the ad that I sent you this morning... I got it right here.
[02:47:47.059 --> 02:47:47.459]  Okay.
[02:47:47.899 --> 02:47:53.305]  Everybody out there, it doesn't matter whether you're from the left or the right, we've got to get together and do this now.
[02:47:53.325 --> 02:47:53.866]  Bingo!
[02:47:53.886 --> 02:47:59.171]  Just forget, turn off the damn TV right now, get out there and do something.
[02:47:59.432 --> 02:47:59.652]  Right.
[02:48:00.034 --> 02:48:00.394]  You know?
[02:48:00.454 --> 02:48:00.954]  That's right.
[02:48:01.715 --> 02:48:05.376]  All the stuff in the world means nothing if you lose everything you have.
[02:48:05.436 --> 02:48:08.838]  If you lose your freedom, if you lose absolutely everything.
[02:48:09.138 --> 02:48:09.338]  Bingo.
[02:48:09.358 --> 02:48:10.659]  It ain't gonna make a difference.
[02:48:10.739 --> 02:48:11.259]  That's right.
[02:48:11.339 --> 02:48:12.239]  Get off your butts!
[02:48:12.279 --> 02:48:12.960]  That's right.
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:13.680]  There we go.
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.661]  So everyone, get mad now.
[02:48:15.761 --> 02:48:16.701]  There you go, Nina.
[02:48:16.822 --> 02:48:17.422]  Okay.
[02:48:17.622 --> 02:48:18.242]  Alright.
[02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:21.103]  Go, go, hey, do me a favor this weekend.
[02:48:21.143 --> 02:48:23.805]  Go spit a couple of bullets for me.
[02:48:24.625 --> 02:48:25.025]  Alright.
[02:48:25.085 --> 02:48:26.766]  We're gonna take our final break.
[02:48:27.838 --> 02:48:29.260]  Oh, man, getting ready for the weekend.
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:30.221]  Firing them all up.
[02:48:30.322 --> 02:48:30.923]  Good deal.
[02:48:31.083 --> 02:48:31.804]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:31.824 --> 02:48:32.786]  We're going to take our final break.
[02:48:32.826 --> 02:48:36.772]  We'll be back in about three minutes to wrap it up for this Friday, and yes, this week.
[02:48:36.812 --> 02:48:39.236]  This is Dave Vaughn Gleis, this is the Power Hour at Bill in New Jersey.
[02:48:39.276 --> 02:48:39.757]  You're up next.
[02:48:46.445 --> 02:49:00.318]  If you've ever suffered from arthritis, joint injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, muscle cramps of the back, neck, shoulders, legs, hands, feet, bursitis, tendonitis, muscle pulls, or sprains, then call 877-817-9829 and order Toperson.
[02:49:00.638 --> 02:49:03.520]  Because Toperson immediately soothes pain and inflammation.
[02:49:03.801 --> 02:49:08.024]  It relieves swelling and stiffness, and it improves circulation so the body can heal faster.
[02:49:08.445 --> 02:49:11.748]  No heat, no cold, no grease, and it won't interfere with other medications.
[02:49:12.168 --> 02:49:22.812]  Topperson is a patented anti-inflammatory pain relief homeopathic cream, and it's proven to have a healing effect to damaged muscles, tendons, ligaments, and nerve tissues, and it has no side effects.

[02:49:28.454 --> 02:49:30.777]  So if you suffer from any of these problems, call 877-817-9829.
[02:49:30.797 --> 02:49:30.978]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:49:30.998 --> 02:49:32.740]  Topperson comes with a money back guarantee.
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.042]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Topperson.
[02:49:34.062 --> 02:49:35.023]  Topperson is pain relief.
[02:49:46.019 --> 02:49:53.124]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[02:49:53.744 --> 02:49:54.545]  I'm Tex Mars.
[02:49:54.965 --> 02:49:59.168]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.
[02:49:59.188 --> 02:50:02.730]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[02:50:03.291 --> 02:50:12.117]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[02:50:12.717 --> 02:50:16.363]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[02:50:16.644 --> 02:50:18.046]  Their mysterious symbols.
[02:50:18.387 --> 02:50:19.929]  Their hidden language.
[02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:21.411]  Encyclopedic.
[02:50:22.012 --> 02:50:22.633]  Documented.
[02:50:22.914 --> 02:50:23.835]  Codex Magicka.
[02:50:23.956 --> 02:50:27.001]  Unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.
[02:50:27.785 --> 02:50:36.896]  Please order your personal copy of Codex Magicka on the internet at PowerOfProphecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[02:50:36.916 --> 02:50:37.136]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[02:50:46.081 --> 02:50:50.062]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[02:50:50.502 --> 02:50:53.964]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[02:50:54.424 --> 02:50:57.645]  Cardivite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[02:50:58.045 --> 02:51:02.626]  Made from seven herbs, cardivite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[02:51:02.646 --> 02:51:04.607]  Here's what one person has to say.
[02:51:04.947 --> 02:51:08.613]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[02:51:08.773 --> 02:51:12.619]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[02:51:12.839 --> 02:51:14.041]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[02:51:14.241 --> 02:51:14.742]  It didn't do.
[02:51:14.842 --> 02:51:16.865]  The only thing that worked was your CardiBite.
[02:51:17.226 --> 02:51:19.549]  If you believe CardiBite was made for you, call 1-866-9333.
[02:51:20.691 --> 02:51:20.791]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:51:20.851 --> 02:51:21.151]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:51:21.171 --> 02:51:23.053]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[02:51:23.073 --> 02:51:24.074]  That's h-e-a-r-t-d-r-o-p dot com.
[02:51:24.094 --> 02:51:25.755]  Cardavite is an all natural supplement.
[02:51:25.775 --> 02:51:26.196]  So call today!
[02:51:26.216 --> 02:51:26.276]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:51:54.998 --> 02:51:57.966]  No, we won't back down.
[02:51:57.986 --> 02:52:02.057]  We won't be turned around.
[02:52:03.149 --> 02:52:11.394]  All right!
[02:52:11.434 --> 02:52:15.696]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the final segment of today's Power Hour!
[02:52:15.776 --> 02:52:17.177]  Wow, what's going on here?
[02:52:17.197 --> 02:52:18.018]  I just opened the door.
[02:52:18.038 --> 02:52:19.479]  Hey, you, what are you doing here, Joyce?
[02:52:19.499 --> 02:52:22.600]  We just brought some company in for the end of the program.
[02:52:22.681 --> 02:52:28.304]  Yeah, I was telling the folks out there that the office is closed for another hour or so.
[02:52:28.424 --> 02:52:28.804]  At least.
[02:52:28.844 --> 02:52:30.165]  Yeah, probably will be closed today.
[02:52:30.345 --> 02:52:31.185]  We're going to close today.
[02:52:32.226 --> 02:52:33.726]  I did a really dumb thing.
[02:52:33.786 --> 02:52:38.968]  I turned on this new heater and it just, you know, it just got a smell in there and everybody said, no way.
[02:52:39.088 --> 02:52:40.489]  So we're just airing the place out.
[02:52:40.609 --> 02:52:41.849]  And so that's all there is to it.
[02:52:41.889 --> 02:52:43.089]  Nothing to get worried about.
[02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:44.010]  But anyway.
[02:52:44.950 --> 02:52:45.910]  Yeah, we will be closed today.
[02:52:45.950 --> 02:52:48.311]  So just leave your messages, especially for your Kirkman orders.
[02:52:48.951 --> 02:52:52.073]  And we will get back to you on the message machine.
[02:52:52.113 --> 02:52:53.033]  We'll get back to everybody.
[02:52:53.873 --> 02:52:54.794]  for Kirkman on Monday.
[02:52:54.854 --> 02:52:59.777]  And as you've been speaking, we've got the entire power team has filed into the studio.
[02:52:59.817 --> 02:53:07.822]  We've got Vel and Rose, Debbie, and Kelly, and Joe, and Charlie, and Matt, and Susan here.
[02:53:07.982 --> 02:53:08.923]  Well, anyway.
[02:53:09.283 --> 02:53:12.765]  But tell you what, we have one more quick phone call to get through.
[02:53:12.785 --> 02:53:15.146]  Let me see if I can get a monitor here without feeding back here.
[02:53:15.387 --> 02:53:17.388]  Let's go to Bill in New Jersey.
[02:53:17.468 --> 02:53:18.409]  Bill, are you there?
[02:53:18.429 --> 02:53:19.049]  Yes, I'm here.
[02:53:19.309 --> 02:53:19.989]  Okay, cool.
[02:53:20.029 --> 02:53:20.610]  Welcome aboard.
[02:53:20.810 --> 02:53:23.731]  I'm listening to you on WRMI, too.
[02:53:24.272 --> 02:53:25.372]  I get the feedback here.
[02:53:25.392 --> 02:53:25.813]  I can hear it.
[02:53:25.873 --> 02:53:26.353]  Okay, yeah.
[02:53:26.373 --> 02:53:27.473]  Let me turn this down a little bit.
[02:53:27.493 --> 02:53:28.174]  There we go.
[02:53:28.674 --> 02:53:29.635]  W-R-M-I?
[02:53:29.655 --> 02:53:30.735]  W-H-R-I.
[02:53:30.815 --> 02:53:32.396]  W-H-R-I.
[02:53:32.496 --> 02:53:33.477]  Okay, that'll work.
[02:53:33.597 --> 02:53:35.138]  Yeah.
[02:53:35.218 --> 02:53:39.080]  Because of that bankruptcy thing, I just went through that a few days ago.
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:45.723]  But anyway, if I came to you and I said, Dave, loan me $20,000 to buy a house.
[02:53:48.018 --> 02:53:50.820]  And you set up all the parameters how I have to pay you back.
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:51.240]  Yeah.
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:53.341]  And I got down to one payment.
[02:53:54.762 --> 02:53:59.585]  And you knew I had that money in my house and you sent somebody in there that night to steal that money from me.
[02:53:59.645 --> 02:54:01.246]  Now I have no way of paying you.
[02:54:01.546 --> 02:54:01.967]  Yeah.
[02:54:01.987 --> 02:54:03.408]  You come knocking on my door.
[02:54:03.908 --> 02:54:04.588]  Come for the money.
[02:54:04.608 --> 02:54:06.790]  Somebody broke in last night, Dave.
[02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:09.331]  I ain't got, well I'm sorry, I'm going to have to foreclose on you.
[02:54:09.631 --> 02:54:09.992]  Okay.
[02:54:10.052 --> 02:54:13.754]  This is the crap that is going on in this country.
[02:54:14.715 --> 02:54:16.936]  Every so often they change the rules.
[02:54:18.091 --> 02:54:20.072]  This was kind of a big rule to change.
[02:54:20.772 --> 02:54:24.393]  Because I know there's people that will abuse credit cards.
[02:54:25.454 --> 02:54:29.055]  But I'll tell you what, I ain't never seen so much mail come here with credit cards.
[02:54:29.075 --> 02:54:29.995]  I don't have the thing.
[02:54:30.175 --> 02:54:30.775]  I don't want them.
[02:54:31.776 --> 02:54:34.296]  And so many of them come here every day.
[02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:35.977]  Every day I get these things.
[02:54:36.797 --> 02:54:38.378]  And I just don't want them.
[02:54:38.778 --> 02:54:40.218]  But there is people that abuse them.
[02:54:40.739 --> 02:54:42.059]  And then you really should pay.
[02:54:42.139 --> 02:54:44.860]  But if you as the controller
[02:54:45.609 --> 02:54:52.414]  If you steal the money that I've got to pay you back, pay you off, you change the rules, I don't owe you nothing.
[02:54:53.475 --> 02:54:55.176]  And that's what's happening in this country.
[02:54:55.196 --> 02:54:57.878]  They've done it with IRAs years back.
[02:54:57.918 --> 02:55:02.381]  They had a good IRA set up that was so good that they changed the rules on that.
[02:55:02.401 --> 02:55:03.642]  I don't know if you remember that or not.
[02:55:04.462 --> 02:55:05.663]  But that's the way this is.
[02:55:05.723 --> 02:55:08.445]  Now they're trying to do the same thing with Social Security.
[02:55:09.346 --> 02:55:12.508]  They want to stick it in the stock market so they can crash that.
[02:55:13.024 --> 02:55:23.090]  Well, this is standard operating procedure, Bill, and it's just a matter of us all getting educated and figuring out how these rats have gotten into a position where they can pull this wool over our eyes time and time and time again.
[02:55:23.430 --> 02:55:24.591]  When will America learn?
[02:55:24.851 --> 02:55:26.412]  Hey, thank you so much for the call, Bill.
[02:55:26.452 --> 02:55:27.353]  We're flat out of time.
[02:55:27.373 --> 02:55:28.513]  We're right up against it here.
[02:55:29.674 --> 02:55:34.577]  Man, I tell you, I am so thrilled that so many people are figuring it out and thinking outside of the cage.
[02:55:34.597 --> 02:55:37.599]  We have a whole lot of new listeners and new first-time callers here.
[02:55:38.059 --> 02:55:39.340]  It is real important.
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:42.482]  I mean, our entire lives and the lives of our children's children's children
[02:55:42.822 --> 02:55:45.444]  are depending upon us doing the right thing.
[02:55:46.164 --> 02:55:49.967]  Joyce, everybody here in the office?
[02:55:50.047 --> 02:55:54.350]  Yeah, we've got all the power team members here because we want to greet all the listeners.
[02:55:54.390 --> 02:55:56.872]  We want to get everybody fired up and you know what to do.
[02:55:56.952 --> 02:55:57.712]  Here it is.
[02:55:57.833 --> 02:55:59.854]  It's weekend time for the whole weekend.
[02:56:00.114 --> 02:56:00.755]  Stand up!
[02:56:01.255 --> 02:56:02.216]  Stretch your legs!
[02:56:02.836 --> 02:56:08.540]  Take a deep breath and scream from the top of your lungs and the bottom of your souls as if your lives depend upon it and they do.
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:10.421]  We will not
[02:56:12.671 --> 02:56:14.813]  God bless you all!
[02:56:14.894 --> 02:56:15.935]  We'll see you on Monday.
[02:56:15.975 --> 02:56:17.977]  Have a blessed Sabbath and a blessed weekend.
