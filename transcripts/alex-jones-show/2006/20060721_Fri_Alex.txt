[00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.341]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.043]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:09.904]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.345]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:13.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:17.449]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.952]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:35.529]  Welcome, my friends, to this live July 21, 2006 Friday edition.
[00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.053]  Joining us just for one segment, she agreed to stay longer, but we've got to get on to other news.
[00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:51.602]  Sybil Edmonds is coming up later in this hour to talk about her new whistleblower organization to bring forward more information about 9-11 and government corruption.
[00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:57.007]  She will be joining us, of course, the big NSA slash FBI whistleblower.
[00:00:58.371 --> 00:00:59.072]  She's coming up.
[00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:04.755]  We have Dar Jamal joining us via satellite phone from Damascus.
[00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:12.380]  They're in Syria as Israel gears up for a full-scale invasion of southern Lebanon.
[00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:15.843]  They're talking about going all the way into Syria.
[00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:23.468]  This is the provocation Bush promised in late July if Iran did not submit to the New World Order.
[00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.918]  We will also be taking your calls throughout the show today.
[00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.441]  Throughout the broadcast, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.522]  1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.944]  We will go to your calls early in this hour.
[00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:41.788]  Pat Buchanan is decrying what Israel is doing and saying we shouldn't get involved.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.082]  Germany is saying we shouldn't be involved.
[00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.503]  Russia is saying we shouldn't be involved.
[00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:00.865]  China is saying we shouldn't be involved.
[00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:06.809]  The British government is saying this is actually going to backfire on Israel what they're doing.
[00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.411]  France is saying we shouldn't be involved.
[00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.694]  Spain is saying what we're doing is wrong, what Israel is doing is wrong.
[00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:16.976]  And we say we, we're basically Siamese twins with Israel.
[00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:25.228]  So when we look at this situation, it's just spiraling into deeper and deeper hot water.
[00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.889]  But we have to understand something.
[00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.751]  This is part of a larger program of world government.
[00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:43.335]  They need crises to bring in the next steps in the different phases bringing us into a tyrannical one world government.
[00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:47.757]  And we have to understand that every day the Israelis shoot innocent Palestinians
[00:02:48.402 --> 00:03:01.746]  That they are routinely bombing Lebanon and that every time Lebanon or any of its population or any group within Lebanon fights back in any way, it is called terrorism.
[00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:10.977]  And I hear these neocon follower, drone, zombie, brain-dead, anti-conservative minions calling to talk radio.
[00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:13.119]  I was listening to it this morning here locally.
[00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.920]  It's the same thing.
[00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:15.542]  Israel's our ally.
[00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.806]  They're fighting them over there, so we don't have to fight them over there.
[00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.408]  The Arabs all want to kill us.
[00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.391]  They want to destroy America.
[00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.432]  They're deadly.
[00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:28.614]  Israel is David up against Goliath.
[00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:37.240]  Israel's really Goliath, ladies and gentlemen, with 400 to 600 nukes, hundreds of submarines, fighter bombers, medium-range bombers.
[00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:41.319]  Weapons systems in some cases more advanced than what we have.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:04:02.636]  It's an armed camp with a bunch of backwards bombed out third world countries around it with people fighting back with maybe heavy machine guns if they're lucky or these primitive hand-built rockets that our media is acting like are the second coming of King Kong and Godzilla rolled into one.
[00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.971]  Why can you believe someone fired a rocket full of ball bearings?
[00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.952]  Full of ball bearings!
[00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:11.693]  What if we did something like that?
[00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:13.654]  What do you think Israel and the U.S.
[00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:14.835]  government do all the time?
[00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:18.697]  They drop cluster bombs on civilian populations every day!
[00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:25.120]  I mean, they drop, quote, anti-personnel munitions.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.184]  I'm sorry, not cluster bombs, but anti-infantry, anti-personnel
[00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.640]  Devices, munitions, there.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:46.144]  Let me use the... And the Patriot Act is patriotic and new freedom for psychological testing is a new freedom and everything is named improperly, but so what?
[00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:51.487]  We'll be back with Sabel Edmonds and then we'll get into the latest developments in Israel.
[00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:53.868]  Things are really heating up in that region.
[00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:54.308]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:04.902]  It's here!
[00:05:05.122 --> 00:05:09.866]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:17.932]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:25.658]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:32.944]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:37.474]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:41.274]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:43.655]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.995 --> 00:05:47.916]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:02.972]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:07.194]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:10.216]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:16.999]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.201]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.782]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.942 --> 00:06:33.068]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apthosine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:42.390]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:50.332]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:08:05.962 --> 00:08:06.603]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:08.344]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:10.145]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:11.626]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.267]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.287 --> 00:08:17.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:22.233]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:29.358]  8 minutes 34 seconds into the second segment of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:33.100]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on the front lines of the information war.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.422]  Our weapon is the truth, the enemy's weapon is lies.
[00:08:36.823 --> 00:08:40.605]  They may have greater forces than us, though they're getting to fail through attrition.
[00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:44.620]  But we have the truth and it's a much more powerful weapon.
[00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:46.463]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:46.523 --> 00:08:54.893]  Dar Jamal joining us from the front lines of the physical war raging and escalating right now in the Middle East.
[00:08:54.913 --> 00:09:00.400]  We'll join us from Syria via sat phone coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.704]  Right now, for just this segment, she's a very busy lady.
[00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:06.286]  Cybele Edmonds joins us.
[00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:18.743]  She's the big FBI slash NSA whistleblower who discovered incredible things that she hasn't even been able to really get into for the Congress or talk radio or print because she's had a gag order put on her.
[00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:33.375]  She has talked about hypothetical situations of government groups in their intercepts, connections to terrorism, weapons, drug dealing, you name it, so you can fill in the blanks and read between the lines.
[00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:39.822]  But we've seen the federal government move against whistleblowers, try to punish them, try to indict them, and then prosecute.
[00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:48.218]  Media, when it reports on crimes of the government, we saw a prosecutor in California who reported on the police framing people.
[00:09:48.618 --> 00:09:50.379]  They then demoted him and tried to fire him.
[00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.921]  The Supreme Court just ruled that that's A-OK.
[00:09:53.241 --> 00:10:00.405]  So we need to circle the wagons for whistleblowers because whistleblowing is such an important facet of a free society.
[00:10:00.445 --> 00:10:02.567]  Sybil Evans, thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:04.288]  Thank you for inviting me, Alex.
[00:10:05.074 --> 00:10:05.955]  You bet.
[00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:14.862]  Just out of the gates, because you've been involved in analysis, you've been involved in government, you've been involved in politics, give us your take on the whole situation right now in the Middle East.
[00:10:17.564 --> 00:10:27.892]  Well, Alex, as we see from the main media, one more time, our government is proving its one-sided foreign policy.
[00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:54.766]  And now, after all the disaster in Iraq, and after seeing what's happening right now in Afghanistan, now we have this disastrous situation in Lebanon, and yet we have a totally ineffective foreign policy, and our main media, instead of really bringing up this issue, which is the root, the cause of our problem, which started with 9-11, or actually before that, they are still
[00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:59.133]  You know, focusing on this one-sided, hypocritic foreign policy.
[00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:04.216]  Well, I agree with you, and you know, I track what happens in Israel.
[00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:05.937]  Routinely, soldiers are captured.
[00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:08.098]  It's an ongoing guerrilla war.
[00:11:08.619 --> 00:11:22.627]  Israel on a daily basis is bombing different targets, bombing their neighbors, in some cases civilian areas, and in the minute that there's any fighting from the other side, it's called terrorism when really it's war, and then there have been
[00:11:24.087 --> 00:11:26.948]  1,400 plus rockets, Tinker Toy type rockets.
[00:11:26.968 --> 00:11:33.929]  They're not Tinker Toys if you get hit by one, but compared to Israel's munitions, it's like a slingshot compared to a howitzer cannon.
[00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:37.889]  Just total propaganda in our media.
[00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:45.031]  Now Israel has dropped thousands of bombs and other munitions, anti-personnel munitions, we've confirmed.
[00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:46.771]  Chemical weapons have been used.
[00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:50.232]  They're bombing Christian areas, allied areas to Israel.
[00:11:52.572 --> 00:11:58.695]  It's being billed as Israel protecting itself, but they've even been bombing right up on the Syrian border, up against Syria.
[00:11:58.735 --> 00:12:05.239]  So a huge escalation, and all of our allies, we haven't seen this in a long time, are actually against what Israel is doing.
[00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:07.940]  Right.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.721]  And they're also upset about the U.S.
[00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:10.501]  supporting this.
[00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:14.784]  I just brought that up, obviously, to get your take on it, because it's in the news big time right now.
[00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:19.206]  But also, one other thing that we need to emphasize is
[00:12:19.793 --> 00:12:23.296]  You know, here they started this so-called war on terror.
[00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:34.464]  And with everything that we have been doing, with every action that we have been taking in the Middle East, all we have done is create more hatred towards our policy and our nation.
[00:12:34.805 --> 00:12:46.714]  And we have created far more reasons for groups and organizations and terrorist groups to really go and recruit people into their campaign against the West
[00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:49.093]  And that's exactly what we have been doing.
[00:12:49.134 --> 00:12:51.905]  We have been enabling the terrorist group.
[00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:56.660]  Rather than dismantling and actually fighting the terrorism globally.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:15.709]  Sybil Evans, were you aware of the Pentagon's $6 billion a year program started in 2002 known as the Office of P2OG, where Rumsfeld actually writes in the documents that we will foment and kill innocent people and then elicit, quote, military terrorist responses, which then will allow the U.S.
[00:13:15.749 --> 00:13:17.670]  to expand military operations?
[00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:33.414]  No, I'm not aware of that particular document, but what we are all aware of currently is everything that has already been proven, and these are the secret detention, this is kidnapping people, of course we have had Abu Ghraib and cases of torture.
[00:13:34.054 --> 00:13:42.701]  And also, as far as the expansionism is concerned, I mean, just take a look at, besides the Middle East, look at the Central Asian countries and see what's happening.
[00:13:43.297 --> 00:13:51.971]  I mean, that's another thing that the main media fails to report, and that is, what is happening in Turkmenistan and in Azerbaijan and in Uzbekistan?
[00:13:52.809 --> 00:14:01.576]  And the bases that are being created there, and the activities that we are carrying out there, again, our main media has been absolutely silent on this issue.
[00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:20.831]  And our government is supporting Byzantine dictators that literally, publicly boil people alive, a reign of terror and oppression, and America has gone in the last few years from being the beacon of freedom and liberty, loved by the world, to being universally decried and reviled and hated.
[00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:26.562]  Sybil Edmonds, I want to get into your new organization, National Security Whistleblowers Coalition.
[00:14:26.582 --> 00:14:27.103]  Tell us about it.
[00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:37.886]  Yes, as you know, this organization was first created as a coalition, and this was due to the 9-11 Commissioners report.
[00:14:38.386 --> 00:14:46.629]  As you remember, after about two weeks after the report came out, that this is the so-called report by the 9-11 Commissioners,
[00:14:47.942 --> 00:15:12.871]  People from the intelligence community, various whistleblowers, and this is from FBI, NSA, CIA, DIA, and also the Department of Homeland Security and previous FAA whistleblowers, they all came forward and they joined me in denouncing the report and also letting the public know that many of the witnesses have been turned away.
[00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.172]  They were not interviewed.
[00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:22.690]  And those who were interviewed, many of them, their report and their statements were not included in that report.
[00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:30.577]  And after we started this, gradually the coalition turned into a fairly large organization.
[00:15:30.637 --> 00:15:35.462]  And this is an organization of national security whistleblowers, for whistleblowers, by whistleblowers.
[00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:37.444]  Now we have about over
[00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:45.281]  100 whistleblowers from the FBI, NSA, CIA, DIA, and also the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:15:45.481 --> 00:15:47.863]  Chabelle Edmonds, I want to get more into this in a moment.
[00:15:47.883 --> 00:15:51.787]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com to this national organization.
[00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:57.052]  I want to talk more about that, but obviously you've been coming out incrementally with more and more
[00:15:58.453 --> 00:16:13.983]  What you've been gagged on or what you've been told you can't talk about concerning 9-11 when you went over all of those intercepts and were basically told to shut up about it or destroy it, get rid of it, falsify it, you'd be promoted and you valiantly with great courage refused.
[00:16:14.163 --> 00:16:16.124]  But let me just bring something up concerning 9-11.
[00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:22.328]  Obviously you know the majority of Americans in major polls now believe 9-11 is an inside job, not just that it was a cover-up.
[00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:31.053]  Now, recently, two weeks ago, Bill Doyle, the biggest representative of the largest 9-11 families group, said the government was complicit in the attack and was clearly behind it.
[00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:42.679]  We now have Colonel Ron Ray, Chief Marine Corps, a former historian and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, has gone public saying 9-11 clearly, the evidence points towards an inside job.
[00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:48.402]  Andres Fomulo, former German Defense Minister, Michael Meacher, member of Blair Cabinet, has gone public.
[00:16:48.622 --> 00:16:50.103]  Hollywood director,
[00:16:50.983 --> 00:17:12.654]  Of course, here on this broadcast last week, Richard Linkletter went public and talked about how he'd woken up Bruce Willis a few months ago, Professor Stephen Jones, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, number two at Treasury, Morgan Reynolds, number one chief economist for the last Bush administration, Ray McGovern, CIA analyst, and many others.
[00:17:13.895 --> 00:17:18.619]  Without getting into the documents and the intercepts you saw Sybil Edmonds, is 9-11 an inside job?
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:26.166]  What is Sybil Edmonds, from all the evidence you've seen just in the media, not the classified stuff you saw you can't talk about, what happened on 9-11, Sybil Edmonds?
[00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:40.099]  Well Alex, of course I cannot go ahead and answer this, and this is not only because of gag orders, but the established facts here point out to a larger scale of cover-up by the government.
[00:17:40.603 --> 00:17:45.024]  And that is a government that doesn't have much, you know, that doesn't have anything to hide.
[00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:57.066]  Why would it go to such an extent to prevent the information from coming out, prevent investigations, gag whistleblowers, classify reports?
[00:17:57.246 --> 00:18:05.588]  As you know, two years ago the CIA issued its report on 9-11, and the entire report got classified.
[00:18:06.098 --> 00:18:11.663]  And this is under Porter-Goss, and this was the report, the investigation by CIA on IG.
[00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.544]  So what does all the evidence point at?
[00:18:13.584 --> 00:18:19.589]  General Mahmoud Ahmed wiring $100,000 to Mohammed Adam, meeting with the heads of House and Senate Intelligence days before 9-11.
[00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.272]  What does all the evidence to Sabel Edmonds point to?
[00:18:22.612 --> 00:18:24.954]  Well, we have two types of issues here.
[00:18:25.214 --> 00:18:28.557]  One are all the facts that have already been established, and that is
[00:18:28.993 --> 00:18:30.894]  I mean, we know about the Phoenix Memo.
[00:18:30.914 --> 00:18:32.756]  We know about the Colleen Rowley case.
[00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:36.798]  We know about the Iranian informants in April 2001 coming up with warnings.
[00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:43.142]  We know about the blueprints being sent from the United States to certain countries.
[00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:53.669]  And also, we have had other CIA whistleblowers who have proven and come out with evidence and documentation of a lot of
[00:18:55.054 --> 00:18:59.438]  Documents of cases that point back to the fact that a lot of facts were known.
[00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:06.445]  So, for the government, for Congolese to come out and say, oh, we have no warnings.
[00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:08.286]  Who stood to gain from 9-11?
[00:19:08.507 --> 00:19:09.628]  Who really has a motive?
[00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.329]  Who's gotten power out of 9-11?
[00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.834]  Well, again, we just have to look around us and see who has gained.
[00:19:16.014 --> 00:19:17.235]  And obviously,
[00:19:17.654 --> 00:19:32.670]  9-11 has become this vehicle for the government to implement these totally undemocratic, fascistic legislations and just going against what our country suits for.
[00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:39.117]  And you're looking at the Patriot Act, you're looking at the war with Iraq that the 9-11 provided an excuse for,
[00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.311]  And you're looking at the expansion of Central Asia.
[00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:45.053]  Now you're looking at all the planning towards Iran.
[00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:55.498]  So you're looking at this event that enables some people who have been for years planning and plotting... Sobel, do five minutes more with us on the other side and we'll let you go.
[00:19:55.738 --> 00:19:58.660]  I want you to be able to finish your statement and tell us more about the organization.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.120]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.613 --> 00:20:06.894]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:09.755]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:12.736]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:20:13.096 --> 00:20:18.077]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:21.839]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.719]  Now they look and feel great!
[00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:27.540]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.761]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:20:32.236 --> 00:20:34.697]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:20:35.177 --> 00:20:37.077]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:20:37.798 --> 00:20:40.959]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:48.061]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:20:48.861 --> 00:20:51.062]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:20:51.442 --> 00:20:51.682]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:52.162]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:06.949 --> 00:21:08.170]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.051]  Inflation.
[00:21:09.531 --> 00:21:10.212]  One and the same.
[00:21:10.952 --> 00:21:14.936]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:24.317]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.577 --> 00:21:26.398]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.498 --> 00:21:29.499]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.261]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.641 --> 00:21:36.223]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.703 --> 00:21:40.365]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.406]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:48.811]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:49.171 --> 00:21:50.353]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.373 --> 00:21:50.593]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.408 --> 00:22:12.139]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:19.887]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:23.290]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:29.313]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:35.756]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:39.998]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:22:40.038 --> 00:22:41.919]  The water level is always visible.
[00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:45.180]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:14.872 --> 00:23:15.152]  I think so.
[00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:39.387]  I think so.
[00:24:08.448 --> 00:24:14.613]  Sabel Edmonds is our guest, one of the most famous, the most famous whistleblower concerning the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:24:14.673 --> 00:24:32.787]  We know that the, this story's a lie, we know the government actively ordered FBI agents all over the country from Florida to Illinois, from Wisconsin and Minnesota to Arizona to Dallas, Texas to quote, don't mess with these people, don't stop them, don't investigate them, leave them alone.
[00:24:33.715 --> 00:24:39.779]  We've got Nick Berg, remember, who got his head sawed off giving him his laptop and being at weird airbases with him.
[00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:40.980]  I mean, obviously a spook.
[00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:43.342]  Sabel Edmonds, 9-11.
[00:24:43.602 --> 00:24:44.943]  I mean, you personally.
[00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:48.445]  You know, I've heard you on other shows, I've talked to you here.
[00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:50.386]  All these prominent people are coming out.
[00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:54.068]  I mean, clearly you've just said that elements of the government had the motive for 9-11.
[00:24:54.448 --> 00:24:57.389]  Arabs wouldn't bring down the greatest military in the world upon them.
[00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:03.573]  The majority of Arabs in major polls, what, 90% in foreign polls, believe it was an inside job.
[00:25:04.593 --> 00:25:06.634]  Now half of Americans do in Zogby polls.
[00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:11.237]  I'm asking you, I mean, clearly, where does the evidence point on 9-11?
[00:25:12.352 --> 00:25:14.093]  Well, that is the whole point, Alex.
[00:25:14.473 --> 00:25:18.514]  They are not letting out all the evidence, and we don't have it to this date.
[00:25:18.914 --> 00:25:23.156]  Because, as I was telling you, the IG reports have been all classified.
[00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:38.242]  We also had 35 pages, and this is according to Senator Graham, the most important evidence and information on 9-11 by the Senate and House Joint Inquiry that happened in 2002 classified.
[00:25:38.562 --> 00:25:41.663]  And five years later, everything about it is classified.
[00:25:42.223 --> 00:25:44.802]  And again, you're still having people who are gagged.
[00:25:45.276 --> 00:25:52.638]  So this already points out that they don't want the evidence out, and they are keeping the evidence out of the public stream.
[00:25:53.378 --> 00:26:01.960]  But even if they cut evidence out of reports, we have the clear evidence of thermite in the buildings, we have clear evidence of CIA insider trading, NORAD standing down, U.S.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:08.062]  troops already masked in Central Asia, Bush having the launch order two days before to attack Afghanistan.
[00:26:08.382 --> 00:26:13.043]  I mean, Sabel, when you put all that together, I'm asking you personally, where does all the evidence point?
[00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:17.780]  The evidence points to a massive government cover-up.
[00:26:18.241 --> 00:26:20.022]  And that raises the question of why.
[00:26:20.302 --> 00:26:28.068]  Now, we can answer that in so many different ways and we can speculate, but as I said, the most important thing is to stay with the facts.
[00:26:28.188 --> 00:26:33.472]  Not the facts that the government claims to be the facts, but the facts that are absolutely undisputed.
[00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:39.357]  So, Mel, what I'm asking you is, in your gut, do you think 9-11 to some extent is an inside job?
[00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:47.271]  Well, again, as I am telling you, and I'm trying to tell you is, I have all the evidence of cover-up.
[00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:49.897]  Now, who were the people behind this?
[00:26:50.482 --> 00:26:54.383]  And why, and how, we don't have a definite answer.
[00:26:54.484 --> 00:27:01.226]  As I said, we can come up with theories, we can come up with speculation, but they do not, I mean, in my opinion, they are not facts.
[00:27:01.646 --> 00:27:03.867]  But also what government has been giving us.
[00:27:03.987 --> 00:27:08.228]  Again, I don't consider those the total, you know, total truth or facts either.
[00:27:08.248 --> 00:27:17.812]  Sure, well Daniel Ellsberg went public on this network last week, saying that the evidence points towards an inside job, and that he believes Bush may carry out more terror attacks.
[00:27:18.897 --> 00:27:25.901]  Well, I read Dan's statement, and it was very well argued, and also it was very, very rational.
[00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:36.687]  And what he exactly said is, it points out the possibility of it, and that he wouldn't be surprised if this was the case, because nothing else would explain this level of cover-up.
[00:27:36.707 --> 00:27:37.848]  Would you be surprised?
[00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:38.968]  No, I wouldn't.
[00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:44.652]  You wouldn't be surprised if elements, or criminal elements, or private contractors were involved in 9-11?
[00:27:45.132 --> 00:27:46.213]  No, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:27:46.513 --> 00:27:46.773]  Wow.
[00:27:47.498 --> 00:27:49.000]  Well, I mean, this is important, though.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.043]  If whistleblowers aren't protected, how can we have more evidence come out?
[00:27:52.063 --> 00:27:55.386]  And that's the key area you're fighting on, Cybele.
[00:27:55.426 --> 00:27:56.127]  How do we help you?
[00:27:56.728 --> 00:28:07.619]  Well, if you go to our website, and that is www.nswbc.org, we have put all the documentation on how Congress has been preventing whistleblowers.
[00:28:08.106 --> 00:28:08.486]  I'm good.
[00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:32.398]  And these are the top 12 people in Congress, both in the House and the Senate, who have been preventing investigations into this 9-11 related issue.
[00:28:32.478 --> 00:28:35.221]  Give us the website addresses so we can go look at the dirty dozen.
[00:28:35.321 --> 00:28:35.601]  Sure.
[00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:40.506]  It is www.nswbc.org.
[00:28:40.606 --> 00:28:43.389]  That stands for National Security Whistleblowers Coalition.
[00:28:43.569 --> 00:28:45.130]  nswbc.org.
[00:28:45.311 --> 00:28:46.572]  nswbc.org.
[00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:47.613]  And what about your website?
[00:28:48.317 --> 00:28:52.938]  My website is www.justacitizen.com.
[00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:59.739]  So you wouldn't be surprised, like many others, because of the evidence and the cover-up you've seen, if 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:02.059]  At this point, I have to say no.
[00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:03.060]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.660]  Do you think the evidence is leaning towards that?
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:17.002]  Well, again, considering the level of cover-up and the length at which they have gone to gag people and prevent this information from coming out, I would say yes.
[00:29:18.194 --> 00:29:23.261]  Well, we really appreciate your courage in stepping forward like so many other prominent people have done.
[00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:26.806]  And your courage from the beginning, Sabell Evans, not taking the payoffs.
[00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:28.288]  And we'll all visit the sites.
[00:29:28.328 --> 00:29:29.990]  We'll sign the different petitions you've got.
[00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:34.536]  And we're here standing with you and supporting you and other valiant, brave whistleblowers.
[00:29:34.756 --> 00:29:35.898]  Sabell, have a great weekend.
[00:29:36.098 --> 00:29:37.179]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:37.860]  You too.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.660]  God bless you.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.361]  Vaya con Dios.
[00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:48.969]  We'll be back with continual coverage of the Middle East war that's raging right now, your calls and a bunch of other news, and a report from Syria with Darja Maul!
[00:29:51.652 --> 00:29:54.635]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.555 --> 00:29:58.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:05.425]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:30:05.645 --> 00:30:09.026]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:30:09.226 --> 00:30:12.688]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:30:12.958 --> 00:30:16.200]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.703]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:30:21.743 --> 00:30:31.369]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:30:31.489 --> 00:30:32.830]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:38.273]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:30:38.673 --> 00:30:44.656]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:48.699]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:30:48.739 --> 00:30:49.579]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:03.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.283 --> 00:31:07.405]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.525 --> 00:31:10.387]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.487 --> 00:31:17.170]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.373]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.594 --> 00:31:22.976]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.116 --> 00:31:33.267]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[00:31:33.447 --> 00:31:42.569]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:50.492]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:50.512 --> 00:31:50.932]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:51.012 --> 00:31:52.712]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.985]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:32:05.245 --> 00:32:06.106]  Look no further!
[00:32:06.407 --> 00:32:08.970]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:32:09.411 --> 00:32:17.902]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:32:18.082 --> 00:32:19.784]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:20.665]  We're good to go.
[00:32:48.587 --> 00:32:52.828]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:52.908 --> 00:32:54.548]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:17.545]  Well, you heard her.
[00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:18.205]  A great lady.
[00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:18.986]  A lot of courage.
[00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:19.667]  She's been gagged.
[00:33:19.687 --> 00:33:20.407]  She's been threatened.
[00:33:20.447 --> 00:33:20.908]  You name it.
[00:33:21.288 --> 00:33:22.649]  But we squeezed it out of her.
[00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:25.291]  That's a major headline.
[00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:26.372]  We've got to get that together.
[00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:30.215]  How will it read?
[00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:32.757]  Top government whistleblower Sebel Edmonds.
[00:33:33.898 --> 00:33:37.201]  Evidence points towards 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:38.221]  Or what was the exact quote?
[00:33:38.562 --> 00:33:42.025]  Leans towards 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:33:42.325 --> 00:33:45.708]  Wouldn't be surprised if criminal elements of government carried out 9-11.
[00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.710]  Hmm.
[00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.051]  I mean, obviously everybody knows.
[00:33:52.871 --> 00:34:06.075]  And what Cybele Evans will do is she'll go, well, let's say hypothetically you've heard of these cases where someone in the government listens to the intercepts of our government dealing narcotics, weapons, and funding terrorist groups and protecting them.
[00:34:06.315 --> 00:34:10.116]  Now, I can't say that's what my case is because I've been gagged and I'll be arrested.
[00:34:10.496 --> 00:34:13.557]  But that's a nice hypothetical story, isn't it for you, Alex?
[00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:17.143]  Or here's an example where this has been declassified.
[00:34:17.443 --> 00:34:18.744]  Things I've seen are similar.
[00:34:18.764 --> 00:34:35.895]  Can you imagine me and that lady listening to these intercepts, NSA intercepts being given, being given, to the FBI and she's there hearing all of this, so now we've got to throw a story together on that and get that out.
[00:34:35.936 --> 00:34:36.616]  That is big.
[00:34:36.636 --> 00:34:37.957]  You see, as more people go public,
[00:34:38.607 --> 00:35:05.179]  Daniel Ellsberg last week, and Richard Linkletter, and talking about how now even people, neocons, former neocons, we'll see which way it goes now under pressure, like Bruce Willis, and as all these prominent people, the head of the 9-11 Victims Family Group, Marine Corps historians, as people go public it becomes harder and harder for the cowards out there to go along with the official story.
[00:35:05.819 --> 00:35:08.100]  So we commend the incredible courage of Cybele Edmonds.
[00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:11.050]  I know we've got Mike and Jason and Frank and John and others.
[00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.831]  Listen, folks, you can really only call the show one day a week.
[00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:16.352]  I see somebody in queue who's called twice this week.
[00:35:17.592 --> 00:35:20.053]  In fact, I would like to give preference to first-time callers.
[00:35:20.073 --> 00:35:20.994]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:21.034 --> 00:35:26.556]  We've got 20 phone lines, but they stack up in queue five at a time.
[00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:28.477]  And it's not fair.
[00:35:28.637 --> 00:35:30.137]  So many people tell me they can never get in.
[00:35:31.098 --> 00:35:34.439]  So really, we love you to call, but you can only call once a week.
[00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:38.437]  That's our only restriction, and we like first-time callers.
[00:35:38.758 --> 00:35:41.760]  And if you're calling on your own dime from overseas, you go to the front of the line.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.882]  But that can only be trumped by someone who disagrees.
[00:35:56.863 --> 00:36:03.645]  Well, unfortunately, when we go to people first who supposedly disagree, it's usually a joke or they really agree or they disagree on some small point.
[00:36:03.705 --> 00:36:16.649]  No, I mean jellyfish brains who love world government, love gun control, love open borders, love George Bush, phony conservatives, that type of little toady who knows how to regurgitate by rote
[00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:18.911]  The Religious Neocon Dogma.
[00:36:19.212 --> 00:36:20.914]  You go to the front of the line if you dare.
[00:36:21.134 --> 00:36:22.295]  You occasionally email me.
[00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.356]  I get thousands of emails a day.
[00:36:23.376 --> 00:36:25.979]  I get two or three sniveling, mindless, threatening emails.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.481]  I'd love it if you'd call in.
[00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:27.961]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:27.981 --> 00:36:31.746]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:36:32.046 --> 00:36:33.548]  But first, here is the new ad.
[00:36:33.628 --> 00:36:36.931]  I just love this ad so much I'm airing it a few times here in the middle of the show.
[00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:38.193]  For my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:36:43.343 --> 00:36:43.823]  It's here!
[00:36:44.043 --> 00:36:48.905]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:36:49.285 --> 00:36:57.067]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:36:57.767 --> 00:37:04.930]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:12.392]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:37:12.853 --> 00:37:16.977]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:20.860]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.282]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:37:23.622 --> 00:37:27.585]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:36.072]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:56.056]  That's right, go to PrisonPlanet.tv and we've already got about half the 9-11 conference from two and a half, three weeks ago posted there, including the big roundtable panel discussion that C-SPAN claims are going to air next Wednesday night on C-SPAN 1, 8 o'clock Eastern on American Perspectives.
[00:37:56.777 --> 00:38:04.203]  You can see that from our four-camera shoot, believe me, better than the C-SPAN three-camera shoot, at PrisonPlanet.tv, if you remember.
[00:38:04.643 --> 00:38:10.648]  And a bunch of the other keynote speeches have been uploaded, a bunch of them are there, some others are going up this weekend, I think three more.
[00:38:11.797 --> 00:38:12.858]  My weekly TV reports.
[00:38:12.878 --> 00:38:15.279]  We're putting up some of my classic vintage reports.
[00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:17.280]  TV shows going back five years.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.000]  We put quite a few of those up.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.121]  They've never been seen outside Austin before.
[00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:27.524]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all 15 of my films, a bunch of other films we've been authorized to post, like Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:38:28.044 --> 00:38:30.387]  You'll say, well I can get Loose Change 2nd Edition anywhere on the web.
[00:38:30.668 --> 00:38:33.271]  Yeah, a cruddy Google video, low bandwidth.
[00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:37.096]  You can download high quality ones if you're a member at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:37.396 --> 00:38:42.503]  Plus you support this broadcast and make it possible and help me pay my webmasters a living wage.
[00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:44.305]  Which we attempt to do.
[00:38:44.325 --> 00:38:45.767]  Just get people to raise us again.
[00:38:46.984 --> 00:38:51.148]  But now is the time to become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:38:51.188 --> 00:38:53.510]  Fifteen cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.632]  Or get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[00:38:56.652 --> 00:38:58.334]  But go get a trial month and see if you like it.
[00:38:58.354 --> 00:38:58.994]  I'm sure you will.
[00:38:59.355 --> 00:39:01.697]  Over a thousand pieces of media there right now.
[00:39:03.338 --> 00:39:07.702]  Also, you get my films weeks before they're released on DVD, like TerrorStorm was.
[00:39:08.342 --> 00:39:11.445]  And you get excerpts of films while we're working on them.
[00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:14.968]  Some of the raw cuts months before you see it.
[00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:27.872]  I mean, in the case of PrisonPlanet.TV, right when I got back from London a year ago, or just a year ago, I posted large excerpts of what then was put into TerrorStorm there for you at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:36.998]  But really the best activist tool, the most powerful tool we've got is the high-quality digital DVDs and of course VHS is pretty darn good as well.
[00:39:37.018 --> 00:39:47.426]  You can get all my films, a bunch of other books and videos we carry by other authors at InfoWars.com via the safe, secure online video and book shopping cart, video and bookstore there.
[00:39:47.446 --> 00:39:51.129]  Go to InfoWars.com, order hard copies, take advantage of the big discounts.
[00:39:51.149 --> 00:39:55.212]  Some of my films as low as $5.95 a piece when you get multiple DVDs.
[00:39:55.992 --> 00:40:01.936]  You can also call toll-free to get the films or to get a catalog or ask them questions and decide which videos you want to secure.
[00:40:01.956 --> 00:40:03.717]  1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or just write to me.
[00:40:03.737 --> 00:40:06.279]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:40:19.554 --> 00:40:21.455]  All right, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:40:21.896 --> 00:40:23.677]  Did anybody call in on an open line?
[00:40:23.697 --> 00:40:26.539]  I know we let a few people go that had called in already this week.
[00:40:26.919 --> 00:40:29.721]  Did anybody call in who disagrees on one of the open lines?
[00:40:31.202 --> 00:40:33.063]  And so they're all fellow people that agree with us, huh?
[00:40:34.123 --> 00:40:34.864]  Okay.
[00:40:34.984 --> 00:40:36.505]  Michael in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:40:36.525 --> 00:40:38.106]  Hi, Alex.
[00:40:38.726 --> 00:40:39.307]  Hello, sir.
[00:40:40.608 --> 00:40:44.130]  Yes, I wanted to let you know that I saw TerraStorm and it was excellent.
[00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.930]  Well, thank you.
[00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:47.152]  Did you see it online or did you get a DVD?
[00:40:48.338 --> 00:40:50.380]  I saw it online, as well as order a DVD.
[00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:51.361]  Good, good.
[00:40:52.242 --> 00:41:08.918]  I noticed that while many people don't believe 9-11 at times, you went into the other government operations, such as Gladio and the things they did in Iran, and many people don't understand that the government is committing atrocities all over the world.
[00:41:09.381 --> 00:41:13.124]  And this is, you know, the first 30 minutes of the film is all the admissions.
[00:41:13.785 --> 00:41:15.606]  All the things that are publicly documented.
[00:41:15.726 --> 00:41:18.709]  USS Liberty in conjunction with Israel.
[00:41:19.469 --> 00:41:22.251]  We have just all these cases.
[00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:24.093]  Hitler and Glywods.
[00:41:24.653 --> 00:41:25.894]  Not just the Reichstag.
[00:41:26.114 --> 00:41:27.716]  And the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:41:27.856 --> 00:41:31.519]  And then blowing up a Cuban passenger jetliner.
[00:41:31.539 --> 00:41:33.500]  I mean, so many admitted examples.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.603]  Then we get into British SAS caught carrying out terror attacks.
[00:41:37.812 --> 00:41:40.133]  Late last year in Basra.
[00:41:41.734 --> 00:41:46.396]  Yeah, and also, I also have to commend you for your websites and such.
[00:41:47.056 --> 00:41:52.519]  I recently had to set mine up for a local thing here in Florida, and it's a lot of work.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.660]  You recently set up what?
[00:41:56.221 --> 00:41:59.402]  I set up a website as far as organized people in Florida.
[00:42:00.102 --> 00:42:00.823]  Well, good job.
[00:42:00.863 --> 00:42:01.263]  Keep it up.
[00:42:01.303 --> 00:42:03.764]  What's your take on what's happening in Israel right now?
[00:42:04.845 --> 00:42:05.525]  Well, it's funny.
[00:42:06.224 --> 00:42:21.623]  I'm reading about how Israel set up a mosque as a counterbalance to the PLO and how everybody makes it look like Israel is such a victim when they're bombing civilians and even bombing the Christian people.
[00:42:22.253 --> 00:42:27.015]  Well, they have a gigantic military, the fifth largest conservatively, and that's what we know about.
[00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:28.396]  They're probably the fourth largest.
[00:42:28.416 --> 00:42:32.257]  They've got a bigger arsenal of nukes than England does, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:32.938 --> 00:42:40.181]  And they're over there acting like people shooting tinker toy rockets at them in response to their thousands of bombs being dropped.
[00:42:40.901 --> 00:42:46.063]  I mean, it's a war, folks, but anybody who fights back against the New World Order is called a terrorist.
[00:42:47.624 --> 00:42:50.605]  Yeah, and I believe that America, the government is frothing at the mouth.
[00:42:51.089 --> 00:42:52.390]  Just waiting to get our end.
[00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:53.931]  You're absolutely right.
[00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:54.852]  Thanks for the call, Michael.
[00:42:55.232 --> 00:42:56.193]  Frank in California.
[00:42:56.213 --> 00:42:56.733]  You're on the air.
[00:42:56.793 --> 00:42:57.454]  Go ahead, Frank.
[00:42:58.255 --> 00:42:58.795]  Hello, Alex.
[00:42:59.035 --> 00:42:59.295]  Hi.
[00:42:59.996 --> 00:43:01.077]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:43:01.097 --> 00:43:02.178]  I am a first time caller.
[00:43:02.658 --> 00:43:03.078]  Welcome.
[00:43:03.379 --> 00:43:03.779]  Thank you.
[00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:10.004]  And if I can give a one of your sponsor plugs right now, if you don't mind.
[00:43:10.184 --> 00:43:10.424]  Sure.
[00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:12.786]  Calvin Soap.
[00:43:13.686 --> 00:43:15.428]  I got a when I moved into my house.
[00:43:16.008 --> 00:43:17.870]  Oh, let's say about two years after I moved in.
[00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:18.750]  So it's been about 24 years ago.
[00:43:19.938 --> 00:43:27.081]  I had a water softener put into my house, and one of the things they gave me was a 10-year supply of Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:43:28.241 --> 00:43:31.703]  Well, that's been 24 years, and I've got about three bars left.
[00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:33.464]  It's unbelievable!
[00:43:33.904 --> 00:43:36.985]  Great stuff, and having soft water makes it last a lot longer.
[00:43:37.728 --> 00:43:38.228]  But I love it.
[00:43:38.288 --> 00:43:43.312]  I can't stand it when I go someplace else and use regular bars of store-bought soap.
[00:43:43.492 --> 00:43:48.655]  Coming up in three months, is it three or four he told me, it'll be their 60th anniversary.
[00:43:49.136 --> 00:43:52.298]  The grandfather started it, the father and son own it and run it today.
[00:43:52.938 --> 00:44:01.043]  And it's 85% less in cost than the toxic garbage that Procter & Gamble and others pitch as cleaners.
[00:44:02.704 --> 00:44:04.446]  It's been, like I said, 24 years and I'm
[00:44:06.202 --> 00:44:10.605]  Kind of wondering, do I get another 10 year supply that lasts me 26 years or not?
[00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:13.146]  Well, we recommend folks to start with a yearly supply.
[00:44:13.827 --> 00:44:17.510]  But it's great stuff and I highly recommend it to anyone.
[00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.210]  Thank you.
[00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.091]  What else is on your mind?
[00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:29.638]  Well, a friend of mine got me turned on to you after he heard you on Coast to Coast about, oh, 8 or 9 months ago, talking about 9-11.
[00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:35.654]  Inside job and that sort of thing, and my mind just couldn't wrap around it.
[00:44:35.714 --> 00:44:36.655]  I said, no way.
[00:44:37.035 --> 00:44:37.755]  It couldn't be.
[00:44:37.815 --> 00:44:38.656]  It's impossible.
[00:44:38.996 --> 00:44:40.477]  People are not that evil.
[00:44:41.938 --> 00:44:45.180]  But I did start listening to you on the internet.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.722]  I work at my computer, and I'm at a place where I can listen.
[00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:55.607]  So most days, I listen to your show, and when I can't get it live, it keeps replaying, so I'm able to listen to it.
[00:44:56.267 --> 00:44:57.548]  And you've convinced me.
[00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:00.030]  I'm convinced now.
[00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:04.883]  Well, the science, the facts, the documents, the whistleblowers, it proves it.
[00:45:04.963 --> 00:45:07.784]  I mean, it stands prima facie on its face.
[00:45:08.264 --> 00:45:27.072]  Yeah, and I'm sure I'm like so many other Americans that we believe in freedom, we would gladly sacrifice ourselves to maintain this freedom that we have, and it's just unfathomable that elements within our government would actually allow this sort of thing.
[00:45:27.252 --> 00:45:28.673]  And the thing that we have to
[00:45:29.212 --> 00:45:29.372]  Yes.
[00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:43.402]  Government administration that's doing this.
[00:45:43.422 --> 00:45:49.004]  Departmentalized black world cyst running these little tentacle operations.
[00:45:49.644 --> 00:46:04.431]  The globalists, the New World Order crime syndicate, counted on it being so horrific when they blow Kennedy's head off in front of us, or they stage terror attacks like OKC, or the first World Trade Center attack, that it even comes out that the FBI bombed the World Trade Center, cooked the bomb, gave them the detonators, let it go forward.
[00:46:04.731 --> 00:46:06.472]  Our own informant blew the whistle, it still happened.
[00:46:07.092 --> 00:46:09.993]  They're counting on it being so horrible that we just can't deal with it.
[00:46:10.013 --> 00:46:17.015]  Well, to save lives, to save our republic, we've got to face the facts, we've got to face the horror, and we've got to go public.
[00:46:17.435 --> 00:46:34.101]  Yes, I believe that now, and one of the things that I don't, maybe there's a website out there, but I've been thinking, you know, we keep talking about various people abusing the authority that we, as our employees, we have given them, but yet
[00:46:34.665 --> 00:46:41.806]  It's not the whole system as you know that one Phoenix police officer you had on last week or so talking about.
[00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:46.887]  We need to somehow shine the light on these cockroaches in our society.
[00:46:46.947 --> 00:47:00.050]  Maybe have a web list of these various abusers of power so we can sort by it and find who are these evil cockroaches in our own area
[00:47:01.055 --> 00:47:07.097]  uh... that uh... we can see who they are who is it that's abusing our powers it's not the entire police department is these
[00:47:08.482 --> 00:47:11.283]  Well, it's the federally prepared and written policies.
[00:47:11.383 --> 00:47:12.803]  It's templates.
[00:47:13.184 --> 00:47:14.164]  They duplicate everywhere.
[00:47:14.224 --> 00:47:15.164]  Thanks for the call, Frank.
[00:47:15.184 --> 00:47:15.644]  Thank you.
[00:47:15.904 --> 00:47:17.145]  Good to have you on board, my friend.
[00:47:17.165 --> 00:47:20.025]  Please tell your friends, neighbors, colleagues about the broadcast.
[00:47:20.386 --> 00:47:22.206]  John in Ohio, then Eric, Steve, and others.
[00:47:22.246 --> 00:47:22.986]  John, go ahead.
[00:47:23.766 --> 00:47:32.909]  Yeah, I happen to see on Restaurant Television, you know, Kay Gagel and myself, a free speech TV last night that had about four very interesting items on it.
[00:47:33.619 --> 00:47:35.499]  Oh, on INN.
[00:47:35.539 --> 00:47:36.460]  I don't know if you've heard of it.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.020]  International News something.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.080]  Yes, I've been on it.
[00:47:40.741 --> 00:48:00.125]  Oh, well, it surprised me to see that they had quoted your interview with Daniel Ellsberg and accurately pointed out what he said, that he found it very possible that there was an inside job and that, you know, they had the kind of immoral character to pull it off and the physical and motive reasons to do so.
[00:48:00.305 --> 00:48:01.065]  And there was another
[00:48:01.937 --> 00:48:02.338]  I don't
[00:48:22.798 --> 00:48:30.406]  Yeah, Rush Limbaugh and Hillary are in the same boat when it comes to this war, but guess who's gone public against what Israel's doing and aren't supportive of it?
[00:48:31.727 --> 00:48:34.510]  Lou Dobbs, I have the CNN article here, just came out.
[00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.792]  Lou Dobbs is decrying it, he's with us.
[00:48:37.112 --> 00:48:37.893]  And guess who else?
[00:48:37.933 --> 00:48:38.694]  Pat Buchanan.
[00:48:38.774 --> 00:48:46.421]  So, the neocons are going to have a lot of trouble demonizing people that are against what's happening over in the Middle East right now, because we are the majority.
[00:48:46.989 --> 00:49:06.882]  Yeah, and the sniveling character of this totally unscrupulous Hillary Clinton where she goes out across from the United Nations and it's mentioned by WSWS that she's got the biggest recipient of the APEC lobby and she was actually celebrating the Israeli war crimes
[00:49:07.463 --> 00:49:15.888]  An escalating of them into a... Well, I mean, it just came out in the New York paper two days ago that she's having more fundraisers with Rupert Murdoch and he's trying to keep them secret.
[00:49:15.948 --> 00:49:19.450]  I mean, they control Bush and Hillary just like they control Bill Clinton.
[00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:20.391]  They own these people.
[00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:23.112]  Well, it's incredible.
[00:49:23.132 --> 00:49:36.861]  The Democrats, the Republicans, the corporate media... I think Bush calculated that now that his polls and his credibility have gone into the toilet that this kind of untouchable totem, this sacred cowl of Israel
[00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:41.633]  That has this propaganda lines between the APEC and the U.S.
[00:49:41.653 --> 00:49:48.456]  Military Industrial Complex will be able to bring us into a war with Iran and Syria through the back door.
[00:49:48.876 --> 00:49:58.540]  Because there's such a total slavish perpetration of the upside-down view of who's the aggressor and who's the victim in this whole situation.
[00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:04.183]  To the extent that you even have the Israeli newspaper, Haratz,
[00:50:05.076 --> 00:50:12.945]  Uh, coming out and saying that regrettably, this was on July 17th, regrettably the Israeli army once again looks like the neighborhood bully.
[00:50:12.985 --> 00:50:15.207]  A soldier was abducted from Gaza.
[00:50:15.768 --> 00:50:17.028]  We'll make all of Gaza pay.
[00:50:17.209 --> 00:50:19.129]  8 soldiers are killed and 2 abducted in Lebanon.
[00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.450]  We'll make all of Lebanon pay.
[00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.670]  Do you know who did that?
[00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.670]  The Nazis.
[00:50:23.011 --> 00:50:26.992]  If they went into a town and one of their people got captured or shot, they'd kill 100 people.
[00:50:27.492 --> 00:50:29.053]  Well, Israel goes further than that.
[00:50:29.133 --> 00:50:33.714]  I mean, 3 people get captured, so they've killed over 400 now, and the number's growing.
[00:50:34.234 --> 00:50:36.255]  And they've got 9,000 prisoners.
[00:50:36.275 --> 00:50:38.516]  9,000 prisoners, some of them tortured.
[00:50:38.616 --> 00:50:41.517]  Women and children held 3 years without trial.
[00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:44.518]  And one prisoner of war is captured after
[00:50:45.638 --> 00:50:50.825]  Israel could kidnap the day before two civilians, and that's left out of the news.
[00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:51.345]  I know.
[00:50:51.686 --> 00:50:53.388]  Listen, I appreciate the call, John.
[00:50:53.528 --> 00:50:54.469]  It's outrageous.
[00:50:54.489 --> 00:50:55.571]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:51:04.819 --> 00:51:05.319]  It's here!
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.302]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.663 --> 00:51:18.327]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.008 --> 00:51:26.052]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.452 --> 00:51:32.996]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:51:33.826 --> 00:51:37.928]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.189 --> 00:51:41.671]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.151 --> 00:51:44.072]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.412 --> 00:51:48.315]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.733 --> 00:52:06.959]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:15.209]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:22.517]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.697 --> 00:52:23.958]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:24.038 --> 00:52:29.943]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:30.124 --> 00:52:35.228]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:35.328 --> 00:52:44.216]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.476 --> 00:52:47.779]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:52:49.861 --> 00:52:50.542]  We're good to go!
[00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:18.762]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.623 --> 00:53:50.705]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.885 --> 00:53:56.847]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:05.051]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:08.933]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:15.796]  My view on Israel has always been rock solid.
[00:54:15.897 --> 00:54:16.777]  It's based in history.
[00:54:18.363 --> 00:54:20.965]  I don't believe Israel is the great evil on the planet.
[00:54:21.965 --> 00:54:25.247]  I believe governments are evil and corrupt and run by gangsters.
[00:54:26.768 --> 00:54:29.910]  I mean, you study Iran, very corrupt, the mullahs out of control.
[00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:33.732]  But, they're not trying to have world domination, they're not attacking the U.S.
[00:54:34.072 --> 00:54:43.858]  We've done horrible things to them, overthrowing several of their governments, occupying them, staging terror attacks, persecuting their people with the Savak, their secret police.
[00:54:44.858 --> 00:54:46.299]  Same thing with Saddam.
[00:54:46.339 --> 00:54:48.601]  Our government put him in, set him up, did all of that.
[00:54:49.181 --> 00:54:51.403]  Israel has been behind founding Hamas.
[00:54:51.763 --> 00:54:53.664]  They've been involved actually funding Hezbollah.
[00:54:54.105 --> 00:54:59.829]  Clinton helped ship weapons and money to Iran, who then armed bin Laden to lead the attacks on the Serbs.
[00:54:59.849 --> 00:55:00.890]  Then we attacked the Serbs.
[00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:06.734]  My point is, our governments are behind many of the so-called terrorists, and that can't be ignored.
[00:55:09.022 --> 00:55:13.485]  And Israel does engage in vicious atrocities against the Palestinians.
[00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:15.606]  They are predominantly the aggressor.
[00:55:16.207 --> 00:55:17.828]  It is ancient tribal warfare.
[00:55:17.888 --> 00:55:19.249]  Both sides do bad things.
[00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.071]  But if you weigh the two, Israel is the big bully.
[00:55:24.492 --> 00:55:28.255]  They are Goliath, as I heard a caller on talk radio this morning, state locally in Austin.
[00:55:28.715 --> 00:55:29.756]  They are the Goliath.
[00:55:30.236 --> 00:55:31.057]  They are not David.
[00:55:33.138 --> 00:55:35.820]  And so, that's the point I'm trying to get at here.
[00:55:38.212 --> 00:55:43.240]  I come out when Israel does something wrong, when they found fake Al-Qaeda groups and get caught doing it, I talk about it every week.
[00:55:44.421 --> 00:55:50.190]  When Israel's involved in the USS Liberty, I expose them for being involved in it, and I expose how our own government was involved.
[00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.053]  I've interviewed the admirals and people that took the call.
[00:55:53.057 --> 00:56:03.286]  And then so I'm attacked for being anti-Israel, and then the other sniveling crowd, who probably works for the ADL, posing as a little white supremacist, says, well, Jones, you know, says the U.S.
[00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.047]  attacked the U.S.S.
[00:56:04.087 --> 00:56:04.407]  Liberty.
[00:56:04.487 --> 00:56:06.489]  No, that's another fabrication and a lie.
[00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:08.911]  My film, Terror Storm, is the same as my radio show.
[00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:10.112]  I point out how the U.S.
[00:56:10.152 --> 00:56:11.092]  and Israel together did it.
[00:56:11.353 --> 00:56:15.176]  See, these are deceptive liars and twisters who just make things up.
[00:56:17.725 --> 00:56:18.365]  And they're there.
[00:56:18.386 --> 00:56:22.848]  Again, the New World Order can't attack us now from the position of they're the New World Order and we're bad.
[00:56:22.888 --> 00:56:25.750]  No, they have to pose as patriots to then try to attack us.
[00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:27.251]  And it's ineffective, so just keep it up.
[00:56:28.432 --> 00:56:29.433]  Just send us more people.
[00:56:30.613 --> 00:56:30.913]  No, no.
[00:56:30.973 --> 00:56:32.074]  We're balanced here.
[00:56:32.294 --> 00:56:33.435]  I don't hate Jews.
[00:56:33.535 --> 00:56:37.438]  I'm not against Jews any more than I'm against Germans because they produced Hitler.
[00:56:38.098 --> 00:56:39.779]  The British people are wonderful people.
[00:56:39.799 --> 00:56:41.120]  I have two employees that are British.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.741]  Their government is evil.
[00:56:43.729 --> 00:56:47.652]  And I'm sick and tired of Christians getting blamed because George Bush claims he's a Christian.
[00:56:48.032 --> 00:56:48.973]  Oh, you Christians are bad?
[00:56:49.013 --> 00:56:49.774]  Look at George Bush.
[00:56:49.814 --> 00:56:51.955]  It's the same thing as saying, you Jews are bad?
[00:56:52.036 --> 00:56:53.296]  Look at, uh, Olbert.
[00:56:53.737 --> 00:56:55.238]  Or look at, uh, Sharon.
[00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:56.579]  Or look at Netanyahu.
[00:56:57.059 --> 00:56:58.721]  Or look at any of these, uh, people.
[00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:01.603]  No, those are the criminal gangsters.
[00:57:02.123 --> 00:57:03.584]  Again, I'm against the Italian Mafia.
[00:57:03.624 --> 00:57:04.905]  It doesn't mean I'm against Italians.
[00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:05.506]  They're great people.
[00:57:06.329 --> 00:57:11.554]  I'm against the Jewish Mafia, the second biggest Mafia in the United States that no one is supposed to talk about.
[00:57:11.954 --> 00:57:14.836]  It's not anti-Semitic or bad that I'm against the Jewish Mafia.
[00:57:16.878 --> 00:57:21.902]  They'll study criminology, it's there, it's public, it's available, but it's still somewhat of a secret in the news.
[00:57:23.323 --> 00:57:27.307]  So, you know, I get it from both sides, and I'm proud to not be a bigot.
[00:57:28.208 --> 00:57:29.629]  I'm proud to have Jewish friends.
[00:57:30.726 --> 00:57:33.407]  I am proud to stand up for Jewish life.
[00:57:33.787 --> 00:57:39.708]  You know, I've been criticized for exposing the radiation of 110,000 Jewish children.
[00:57:40.808 --> 00:57:49.651]  Our government funded the radiation test, paid $3 billion to Israel to carry out the radiation test.
[00:57:50.091 --> 00:57:53.311]  Israel was just as culpable as our government.
[00:57:54.492 --> 00:57:59.533]  And that's how the anti-Semites play it, is they go, Oh, look at Alex Jones!
[00:58:00.586 --> 00:58:05.011]  He says our government radiated the Jewish children.
[00:58:05.451 --> 00:58:13.520]  No, in the articles we've written, the articles we've posted, or even in the Jerusalem Post, it's how the Israeli government did it, in collusion with our government.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.923]  It doesn't mix out our government or Israel being involved.
[00:58:17.484 --> 00:58:21.068]  So this is the type of twisting we witness.
[00:58:22.552 --> 00:58:24.072]  It's just amazing.
[00:58:24.393 --> 00:58:29.174]  But that's what the government, we're now being able to prove from the evidence we've got, that this is the government.
[00:58:29.634 --> 00:58:31.115]  And it just shows we're over the target.
[00:58:31.395 --> 00:58:37.837]  It shows we're getting really, really effective as the globalist attempt, in a petty way, to break up our movement against the New World Order.
[00:58:41.498 --> 00:58:46.499]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:58.331]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.991 --> 00:59:00.033]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.754 --> 00:59:01.875]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.536 --> 00:59:03.337]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.098 --> 00:59:04.979]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.999 --> 00:59:09.365]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.845 --> 00:59:13.930]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.002 --> 00:59:32.089]  Dar Jamal is a seasoned reporter who's been inside Fallujah during the bombardment in Iraq and all over the Middle East, Palestine, he's in Syria right now, in Damascus, as the Israelis threaten to even bombard that country that's been groveling and licking their boots.
[00:59:33.823 --> 00:59:39.511]  He's got a sat phone and we've been connecting with him and it's breaking up his satellite phone.
[00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:40.472]  It's intermittent.
[00:59:40.492 --> 00:59:42.675]  We're trying to get a good connection with him.
[00:59:42.735 --> 00:59:44.097]  As soon as we do, we'll get him on.
[00:59:44.457 --> 00:59:46.080]  The hotel phone is even worse.
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.443]  Sounds like you're talking through 100 feet of water.
[00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:51.878]  So we'll work on getting Dar Jamal on.
[00:59:51.898 --> 00:59:52.219]  What is it?
[00:59:52.259 --> 00:59:54.761]  It's about 8 o'clock at night over there right now.
[00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:59.745]  We've got an hour and 59 minutes left in this transmission on this Friday edition.
[00:59:59.765 --> 01:00:01.806]  We'll be sure to get him up for you sometime.
[01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:04.188]  Are we able to connect with him now?
[01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:10.293]  Yeah, we keep redialing the satellite phone and he answers and he can intermittently hear us.
[01:00:11.454 --> 01:00:15.597]  If you're able to hear him, if you're able to get through, just tell him we're going to put him up and he can give us a statement.
[01:00:16.278 --> 01:00:16.858]  He's there.
[01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:18.640]  We've got the reports he's been writing.
[01:00:19.494 --> 01:00:20.775]  Hey Alex, good day to you.
[01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:41.297]  Um, I was just, uh, bringing up some news.
[01:00:41.357 --> 01:00:45.001]  Maybe it's, uh, about a week and a half, two weeks old, but the, uh, big dig up in here.
[01:00:45.162 --> 01:00:52.630]  Well, I don't know if you heard about the, uh, guy going with his wife through the tunnel and the slab of concrete fell down on his car and crushed his wife to death.
[01:00:53.493 --> 01:00:58.998]  Well, yeah, I mean, more and more in the past we built good roads, we built good cars, we built, you know, good schools.
[01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:15.551]  Now everything is so mafia run, and by that I don't mean the classical mafia, I mean the, you know, the real mafia, our government, that everything's falling apart there, what, it's like three or four times, I forget the cost, it was supposed to cost, all the big toll roads going in, transponders, total police state.
[01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:17.052]  Oh yeah, good old Bechtel.
[01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:33.728]  But, uh, the point that I was making is, uh, I'm watching the news that day, the night that it happened, and they're showing the, where the slab fell, and they have the police tape around it, they have the state police out there with a watch, they have the governor saying that it's declared a crime scene, all this stuff going on for one person.
[01:01:34.188 --> 01:01:35.730]  How come they didn't do that in Ground Zero?
[01:01:36.947 --> 01:01:37.448]  I don't know.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:58.124]  He's from Costa Rica, didn't speak a lick of English, and he doesn't want to sue the, you know, anybody who is responsible.
[01:01:58.184 --> 01:02:01.085]  All he wants is for his family to come up from Costa Rica.
[01:02:01.406 --> 01:02:09.710]  So, you know, don't sue the people who are responsible and get the money from Bechtel, but, you know, take the money out of the taxpayers to bring his family up here and make them all legal citizens.
[01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:14.753]  I thought that was, you know... Yeah, they spin it into a worship the illegal aliens, you know.
[01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:15.614]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:16.303 --> 01:02:22.787]  And also, I just want to say, being a privileged member of Prison Planet TV, I saw the new Terror Storm when it came out and it was excellent.
[01:02:23.447 --> 01:02:25.549]  I look forward to getting some hot copies.
[01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:29.031]  I know if I can wake Bruce Willis up, it'll wake just about anybody up.
[01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:30.832]  And it was really excellent.
[01:02:30.892 --> 01:02:31.852]  I enjoyed it very much.
[01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:40.838]  Well, Bruce told his director friend Richard Linklater that my film, Martial Law, woke him up and shifted his paradigm and that he sees things differently and will watch who he supports in the future.
[01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.660]  We'll see if he comes out worshiping the New World Order again.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.361]  We'll see if Bruce has really changed.
[01:02:45.681 --> 01:02:45.881]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.522 --> 01:02:51.626]  But I recommend anybody out there who's not a member of Prison Planet for under six dollars a month.
[01:02:51.686 --> 01:02:53.607]  I mean, it's ridiculous not to be a member.
[01:02:53.647 --> 01:02:59.191]  It is a treasure trove of knowledge and all the great videos are from you and your other people.
[01:02:59.372 --> 01:03:01.013]  And I mean, the PDF books.
[01:03:01.073 --> 01:03:02.334]  I mean, it's excellent.
[01:03:02.374 --> 01:03:05.296]  Anybody who's not a member, I encourage them to go on average.
[01:03:05.336 --> 01:03:07.838]  There's about seven pieces of new media a week.
[01:03:08.496 --> 01:03:10.778]  Video, audio, all of it.
[01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:14.800]  And there's over a thousand pieces total up there on the site right now.
[01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:18.683]  Two plus years, two years, four months in operation.
[01:03:18.723 --> 01:03:19.884]  It just gets bigger and better.
[01:03:20.204 --> 01:03:23.686]  And we're always expanding the servers and trying to make it even better for everybody.
[01:03:24.127 --> 01:03:31.412]  Well, we've got three different formats for download, two different bandwidths, three different formats.
[01:03:32.032 --> 01:03:34.054]  And so I'm glad you like PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:34.094 --> 01:03:34.594]  Thank you, sir.
[01:03:35.055 --> 01:03:37.337]  PrisonPlanet.tv funds so much of what we're doing.
[01:03:37.357 --> 01:03:38.358]  We thank you for the support.
[01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:44.403]  Alright, we will come back and go to Steve, David, Tim, and others.
[01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:49.467]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us on this Open Line Friday.
[01:03:49.807 --> 01:03:52.610]  We're waiting to connect with Dar Jamal in Syria.
[01:03:56.537 --> 01:03:57.038]  It's here!
[01:03:57.238 --> 01:04:01.982]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.382 --> 01:04:10.048]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.729 --> 01:04:17.774]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.174 --> 01:04:25.060]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:29.590]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:33.371]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:35.772]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:40.033]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:47.293]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:47.473 --> 01:06:49.473]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:14.693]  Cybele Edmonds, the big national security whistleblower.
[01:07:17.135 --> 01:07:18.316]  I posed the question to her.
[01:07:18.336 --> 01:07:19.817]  I got her to go further than she's ever gone.
[01:07:19.857 --> 01:07:21.018]  She's got gag orders against her.
[01:07:21.558 --> 01:07:28.503]  The evidence you've seen, the evidence out there, does it point towards criminal elements of the government being behind 9-11, 9-11 being an inside job?
[01:07:28.543 --> 01:07:29.824]  And she said, yes, it does.
[01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:33.507]  And I said, could you believe that they would carry something like that out?
[01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:34.188]  And she said, yes.
[01:07:35.527 --> 01:07:36.848]  She agreed with Daniel Ellsberg.
[01:07:36.888 --> 01:07:38.250]  So big headline there.
[01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:41.333]  We're going to report out in text for you by this evening.
[01:07:41.793 --> 01:07:46.918]  You need to get that out to everybody in your area immediately.
[01:07:48.339 --> 01:07:50.301]  This is so vitally important.
[01:07:50.321 --> 01:07:51.442]  So that will be up there by tonight.
[01:07:51.922 --> 01:07:53.664]  We were supposed to have Darja Maul on.
[01:07:53.684 --> 01:07:55.986]  Of course, yesterday we could get a hold of him on the sat phone.
[01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.700]  He is a reporter that we've interviewed many times.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.883]  He's been all over the Middle East, inside Fallujah and other war-torn cities.
[01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.946]  He's in Damascus, the capital of Syria, right now!
[01:08:07.442 --> 01:08:11.563]  And in the next hour and 50 minutes of broadcast we have left, we'll continue to try to get a hold of him.
[01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:14.324]  We've been able to connect many times, but he can't hear us.
[01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:15.844]  It's like, hello, hello, hello.
[01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:17.245]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[01:08:17.785 --> 01:08:19.605]  If not, we'll get him back to the hotel, phone her to get him on.
[01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:20.546]  If not, we'll do it on Monday.
[01:08:20.946 --> 01:08:26.507]  But we're going to have open phones throughout the rest of the broadcast, unless Darjamal pops in with us, which may happen still.
[01:08:27.447 --> 01:08:30.808]  Israel's massing troops calling up reserve, saying they may invade.
[01:08:30.828 --> 01:08:33.349]  Take the bottom third, maybe half, of Lebanon.
[01:08:34.617 --> 01:08:37.878]  This whole thing has been hyped in U.S.
[01:08:37.918 --> 01:08:43.399]  media, like Israel's poor little skinny 10-pound twerp fighting a 10,000-ton gorilla.
[01:08:43.879 --> 01:08:52.820]  In reality, it's a bunch of ragtag Palestinians and Lebanese and others in rogue groups fighting back with homemade rockets.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.381]  These are homemade, and the media spins it out, dare them use this against civilians.
[01:08:57.421 --> 01:09:00.622]  Why a missile, a rocket hit that had some ball bearings in it?
[01:09:01.607 --> 01:09:04.948]  They've been dropping anti-personnel cluster bombs on areas of southern Lebanon.
[01:09:05.948 --> 01:09:06.728]  The Israelis have.
[01:09:07.368 --> 01:09:30.372]  I mean, now they're saying it could be as high as 4,000 munitions by the Israelis, plus have been dropped in the last two weeks on their cities, blowing up entire apartment buildings, blowing up water treatment facilities, blowing up airports, blowing up fuel tank facilities, bombing bridges, and it's a build that
[01:09:32.137 --> 01:09:36.540]  That what we're dealing with here is Israel defending itself.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.101]  Israel kills women and children.
[01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:44.785]  We have photos on JonesReport.com of where they just pull people over, take them out of cars, strip them down naked in the street and blow their heads off.
[01:09:45.306 --> 01:09:52.130]  Where there's a father waving his hands innocently in Palestine with his little boy, and the little boy is blown away and he's shot.
[01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:56.813]  And the Israelis go up smiling and stand by the dead bodies and take trophy photos.
[01:09:58.951 --> 01:10:00.712]  And I mean, let's just get honest, folks.
[01:10:00.952 --> 01:10:19.379]  For the rampant, sub-sect, labor Zionists that have mutated into what you call right-wing Zionist crowd, which are the minority in Israel, but through the parliamentary system have been able to maintain control, 60%, right at 60% in major Israeli polls, are against what their government's doing.
[01:10:19.879 --> 01:10:21.000]  Making it bad for everybody.
[01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:32.598]  But that doesn't matter because you've got the radical Likudniks and others who've got laws in Israel where you're arrested if you're not Jewish and you date a Jewish girl or try to marry her.
[01:10:32.698 --> 01:10:35.059]  I mean, folks, that is racist.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.401]  Why is that accepted in our media?
[01:10:37.461 --> 01:10:38.742]  I mean, that's like South Africa.
[01:10:39.734 --> 01:10:50.699]  They have all sorts of, you know, we get mad at Mexico because they don't have extradition for death penalty cases when, you know, cop killers or gangbangers murder people and run to Mexico.
[01:10:51.019 --> 01:10:51.619]  I'm against that.
[01:10:51.639 --> 01:10:52.860]  I think they should be extradited here.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.702]  Israel, you can kill 14 little kids and eat their guts on national TV and fly to Israel.
[01:10:58.742 --> 01:10:59.702]  They won't prosecute you.
[01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:00.543]  They won't do anything.
[01:11:03.064 --> 01:11:04.985]  So Israel needs to be criticized.
[01:11:05.045 --> 01:11:06.585]  They've gotten away with so much.
[01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:07.986]  They've been given so much support.
[01:11:09.108 --> 01:11:15.090]  And it's really gone to seed, and even Haratz has reported that Israel is the bully in this.
[01:11:16.251 --> 01:11:27.175]  And the majority of the Jewish people are against what's happening, and just like George Bush is the figurehead for Christians, the Likudniks-slash-Labor Zionists are the figurehead for Jews, and that's not right.
[01:11:28.696 --> 01:11:29.776]  That's not proper.
[01:11:30.256 --> 01:11:32.457]  That's not based in reality.
[01:11:33.237 --> 01:11:35.881]  And so I am not an enemy of the people of Israel.
[01:11:35.921 --> 01:11:40.627]  I'm not an enemy of them defending themselves, but they are not defending themselves.
[01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:49.159]  They are because the globalists want a war for elections in Israel, elections coming up here, because they want weapon sales, because they want to continue the crisis.
[01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:50.681]  They are taking normal
[01:11:51.523 --> 01:11:53.924]  Normal military activities.
[01:11:54.324 --> 01:12:00.186]  The Israelis are constantly grabbing whole families, torturing them, killing them, grabbing Palestinian fighters.
[01:12:00.466 --> 01:12:04.567]  The Palestinians are constantly blowing up innocent Jews and constantly grabbing people.
[01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:05.407]  This is ongoing.
[01:12:05.767 --> 01:12:07.028]  Why now are they hyping it?
[01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:10.389]  Well, we have the best coverage up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:18.472]  We've been really focusing our main coverage on InfoWars.com the last week on this Israel situation versus PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:25.017]  We have the San Francisco Chronicle where Israel brags that they've been planning an invasion of Lebanon for the last year.
[01:12:25.378 --> 01:12:30.862]  And this will be spun that, oh, well, you know, we always have war games and governments have to get ready.
[01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:31.662]  Certainly!
[01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:32.022]  No, no, no.
[01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:33.604]  They've been saying they were going to invade.
[01:12:33.884 --> 01:12:34.724]  They were kicked out in 2000.
[01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:40.989]  So this is all very, very serious.
[01:12:42.305 --> 01:13:03.512]  Because Bush told Iran that he was going to escalate things into full-bore attack and war and bombardments of over 200 sites in Iran by late July was the cut-off date that he set a month ago if they didn't basically follow orders and destroy their entire peaceful nuclear power plant program.
[01:13:04.685 --> 01:13:13.390]  And now, right on time, here is the late summer, early fall election surprise.
[01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:15.611]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:13:15.651 --> 01:13:17.432]  And the neocons are beating the drums.
[01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:21.174]  They're the current client management group over our government.
[01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:23.095]  But the big oil companies are more than happy.
[01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:25.617]  Crude oil at over $78 a barrel.
[01:13:25.637 --> 01:13:27.718]  Their own internal memo saying they love it.
[01:13:28.608 --> 01:13:37.592]  Basically using them as their client minions so that later the neocons can be removed like birdcage liner and they'll take the blame for everything like a voodoo doll.
[01:13:37.612 --> 01:13:41.633]  They'll put it all on that and then just, you know, the whole program moves on.
[01:13:41.653 --> 01:13:51.797]  We get Democrats in office and they continue their attacks and warfare and it takes a few years for people to figure out that they're bad so we get Republicans back in and it's really WWF stage wrestling.
[01:13:52.317 --> 01:13:56.719]  You know, this global mob owns both the horses, both the fighters in the race.
[01:13:59.088 --> 01:14:01.289]  And people can't shift out of this and understand this.
[01:14:01.329 --> 01:14:04.550]  Democrats can't understand their party's totally bought and paid for by the globalists.
[01:14:05.351 --> 01:14:11.453]  Republicans can't, you know, get past the two-sided paradigm, the false paradigm, and realize it's all staged.
[01:14:12.233 --> 01:14:16.435]  And that Rush Limbaugh and Hillary Clinton are only different when it comes to rhetoric.
[01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:18.076]  Alright, Kevin, come in here.
[01:14:18.116 --> 01:14:21.597]  You just came to the window, to the studio, and told me something's ready.
[01:14:21.617 --> 01:14:21.977]  Did you get Dar?
[01:14:21.997 --> 01:14:23.078]  I got him at the hotel.
[01:14:23.098 --> 01:14:23.858]  They're calling him.
[01:14:23.878 --> 01:14:24.678]  You got him at the hotel.
[01:14:24.718 --> 01:14:25.479]  We're calling him right now.
[01:14:25.539 --> 01:14:25.759]  Good.
[01:14:26.539 --> 01:14:28.580]  Let's jam a call in before we get Dar Jamal on.
[01:14:29.686 --> 01:14:32.469]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in New York.
[01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:33.089]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:35.231]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:14:35.372 --> 01:14:35.612]  Good.
[01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:43.139]  I just wanted to thank God for guys like you, Steve Quayle, George Norrie, real patriots in this country.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:55.770]  The issue I wanted to talk about, I don't mean to change gears, I'm sorry, I agree with everything you guys are saying about Israel, is if you want any proof of how everything is controlled, I mean it's what they want us to think and what they want us to watch,
[01:14:56.348 --> 01:14:57.889]  And I haven't heard anyone mention this.
[01:14:57.909 --> 01:15:00.652]  I've been trying to get through coast-to-coast open lines all week and I haven't been able to.
[01:15:01.933 --> 01:15:03.975]  Have you noticed that there hasn't been one hurricane?
[01:15:05.696 --> 01:15:07.057]  And we're now approaching the end of July.
[01:15:07.117 --> 01:15:11.381]  We've had two tropical depressions that petered out at like 30, 40 mile an hour winds.
[01:15:13.479 --> 01:15:18.103]  We had a record hurricane season last year.
[01:15:18.283 --> 01:15:23.807]  The seas were even hotter this year in the South Atlantic and the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:15:24.367 --> 01:15:27.530]  And so they were saying it was going to be even more record and it hasn't been.
[01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:31.553]  We know the government can create, control, and kill hurricanes.
[01:15:31.613 --> 01:15:38.739]  Does it mean that we haven't seen a bad season yet because they don't want their military pinned down so they can have a war in the Middle East?
[01:15:39.259 --> 01:15:40.080]  That's speculation.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:40.420]  I don't know.
[01:15:40.894 --> 01:15:48.877]  No, I don't know, but it's just funny that nothing is going on while the whole North Korea thing, and now this, and then, you know, no storms.
[01:15:48.897 --> 01:15:53.439]  You know, if nothing was going on, they would have probably turned Beryl into a... You know what I'm saying?
[01:15:53.459 --> 01:15:56.360]  They would have probably turned that into a giant Category 5 storm.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:06.904]  But that ended up being a... Well, bottom line, we've had the father of weather weapons on, Stanford Research Institute, a bunch of mainstream newspapers, even Fox News picked up on it after we broke it here.
[01:16:07.044 --> 01:16:07.924]  We drive the news.
[01:16:07.964 --> 01:16:09.305]  I mean, it's a big responsibility.
[01:16:09.345 --> 01:16:10.025]  I can't believe it.
[01:16:10.612 --> 01:16:22.081]  But Fox News even did a big report on Ben Livingston, and that's a report from PrisonPlanet.tv members by the way, the only place you can get it, and about how they were killing hurricanes in the late 1960s.
[01:16:22.542 --> 01:16:29.127]  He of course was flooding all of Vietnam during their dry season with 10 feet of water in the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:33.750]  They have it, they can kill hurricanes, they could have killed Katrina and Rita, and they didn't.
[01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:35.332]  Thanks for the call, I appreciate it.
[01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:36.913]  Did we get Darja Maul in this hotel yet?
[01:16:38.211 --> 01:16:40.115]  Okay, Kevin just ran in here and said he just got DAR.
[01:16:40.135 --> 01:16:40.656]  Did you try him?
[01:16:43.361 --> 01:16:44.423]  What, did the hotel answer?
[01:16:44.503 --> 01:16:48.170]  Am I talking about the SAT phone?
[01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:49.052]  Did you try the hotel phone?
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:17:11.333]  Well, we know that if our government, NSA, England, Israel, the U.S., who all team up with these sabotage systems through the NSA, if anything's being jammed, it's been in mainstream news that they do jam press reports on telephones out of Iraq and out of Syria and out of Lebanon when there is military operations.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.181]  So it's weird that we're able to call him from my office here.
[01:17:15.221 --> 01:17:16.881]  It could just be phone line connectivity.
[01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:21.582]  But we're unable to contact him and for him to be able to hear us from the network.
[01:17:23.103 --> 01:17:24.763]  This is really getting frustrating.
[01:17:24.803 --> 01:17:25.963]  We may have to do a phone patch.
[01:17:26.264 --> 01:17:27.704]  We've got a 1-800 line here.
[01:17:28.724 --> 01:17:30.485]  But if it is the government, they'll just jam that.
[01:17:30.525 --> 01:17:31.425]  This is so annoying.
[01:17:31.705 --> 01:17:32.305]  Probably isn't.
[01:17:32.325 --> 01:17:33.705]  It's probably just a technical thing.
[01:17:34.306 --> 01:17:35.066]  Just stay with us.
[01:17:35.126 --> 01:17:36.546]  Dar Jamal from Syria.
[01:17:37.046 --> 01:17:40.267]  If we're able to get him coming up.
[01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:42.538]  I shouldn't even have tried this.
[01:17:42.718 --> 01:17:44.979]  We should have tested it more beforehand, but we didn't, and it worked.
[01:17:45.019 --> 01:17:49.081]  So, Shayla V, as they say, so is life.
[01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:57.544]  I mean, he's there in the middle of it, up close to the bombardments that are going on right up to the Syrian border, and Syria is the next big target.
[01:17:57.645 --> 01:17:58.785]  Israel has said.
[01:17:59.365 --> 01:18:01.826]  Neocons thumping their chest here have stated.
[01:18:02.927 --> 01:18:07.309]  We will cover it all coming up later.
[01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:20.092]  But individuals act like out there, the people that support what Israel is doing, they act like we should all get involved in this and support it because Israel can't stand on its own.
[01:18:21.534 --> 01:18:25.977]  Israel is the 800 pound gorilla in the Middle East.
[01:18:25.997 --> 01:18:26.578]  400 to 600 nukes.
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:40.928]  Hundreds of attack cruisers and submarines and fighter bombers and a huge military and Abrams M1A tanks and attack drones and nerve gas and race-specific bio-weapons brimming.
[01:18:40.948 --> 01:18:48.153]  It's like a giant flame-breathing porcupine bristling with armaments, blistered with armaments.
[01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:52.375]  And we all hear that we've got to go along with it.
[01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:57.559]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:01.442]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:02.983 --> 01:19:12.626]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:13.546 --> 01:19:18.708]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.

[01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:33.459]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:19:53.308 --> 01:19:54.269]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.349 --> 01:19:59.132]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.312 --> 01:20:07.117]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.377 --> 01:20:12.741]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:19.926]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:20.226 --> 01:20:25.572]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.812 --> 01:20:30.557]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.898 --> 01:20:38.526]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.846 --> 01:20:41.529]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:45.071]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:46.432]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.452 --> 01:20:46.672]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.762 --> 01:21:01.390]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[01:21:16.062 --> 01:21:22.529]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:21:22.689 --> 01:21:24.571]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:21:24.771 --> 01:21:30.797]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:21:31.037 --> 01:21:36.703]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:22:56.677 --> 01:22:58.140]  All right, Dar Jamal.
[01:22:59.721 --> 01:23:05.043]  He's a veteran combat journalist from the hardest fighting in Fallujah, Baghdad, all over the Middle East.
[01:23:05.123 --> 01:23:10.686]  He is very close to the border, just a few miles from where Israel has been bombing in northern Lebanon.
[01:23:11.206 --> 01:23:15.988]  He is in southern Syria, just south of Damascus right now.
[01:23:16.249 --> 01:23:17.469]  We have him via the hotel phone.
[01:23:17.489 --> 01:23:19.950]  He's been out in the streets with his set phone having problems.
[01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:26.473]  Dar, give us a report on what's happening, what's really behind this deal politically, how the neocons tie in.
[01:23:28.734 --> 01:23:29.695]  Right.
[01:23:29.715 --> 01:23:42.161]  Starting with just the current situation, it is an absolute catastrophe in Lebanon.
[01:23:42.241 --> 01:23:45.002]  The first thing that Israel has done, now having flown
[01:23:45.507 --> 01:23:52.189]  Over 60,000 jet fighter missions over Lebanon dropping bombs up and down the country, literally.
[01:23:52.309 --> 01:23:54.830]  Every major coastal city has been hit.
[01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:57.271]  Beirut has been absolutely hammered.
[01:23:57.851 --> 01:24:07.954]  Their first thing that they did after their two soldiers were captured by a Hezbollah raid just over their border was basically take out the Lebanese infrastructure.
[01:24:08.014 --> 01:24:14.996]  They have made it to where water and electricity are unavailable in most of the major cities in Lebanon now.
[01:24:15.632 --> 01:24:22.757]  They've killed well over 350 people at this point, well over 1,250 wounded, just in Lebanon alone.
[01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:29.582]  Hezbollah has responded by firing many rockets, hundreds of rockets now, into northern Israel.
[01:24:29.923 --> 01:24:32.424]  They've killed at least 25 people there.
[01:24:33.085 --> 01:24:36.007]  But it is a catastrophe for the Lebanese people.
[01:24:36.047 --> 01:24:41.191]  Basically, the entire country of Lebanon is being collectively punished by the Israeli military.
[01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:42.532]  Now, you're Lebanese, aren't you?
[01:24:45.345 --> 01:24:46.926]  I'm sorry?
[01:24:48.247 --> 01:24:48.528]  I'm sorry?
[01:25:03.388 --> 01:25:04.770]  I am of Lebanese descent.
[01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:06.611]  That is why I have an Arabic name.
[01:25:06.651 --> 01:25:08.854]  I do have cousins in there in Beirut.
[01:25:09.214 --> 01:25:15.721]  Nobody in my family, including myself, has heard from them since the bombing began, since the very first days of the bombing.
[01:25:15.781 --> 01:25:24.149]  So I'm, of course, very worried about them and have several friends in there as well and have had no word from any of them and we're starting to expect the worst.
[01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:36.263]  It is a catastrophe to watch the country where my great-grandparents came over to the United States from being bombed into oblivion by the Israelis as collective punishment.
[01:25:36.584 --> 01:25:42.070]  And I think what this is, because if we look at this Israeli response, this is something that's been planned for months in advance.
[01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:46.831]  It's very clear.
[01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:58.994]  This plan has been in the works, and I've even heard Israeli military people recently say their stated goal is to basically reshape the Middle East in a way that will fit Israeli interests.
[01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:00.734]  And that's clearly what we're happening.
[01:26:00.794 --> 01:26:02.575]  This isn't just about Hezbollah.
[01:26:02.855 --> 01:26:07.936]  This is about certainly trying to take them out of the picture so they can't threaten Israel anymore.
[01:26:08.116 --> 01:26:11.177]  But I think this fits very well into the project of the New American
[01:26:12.789 --> 01:26:20.933]  Very clearly, between Israel and the U.S., the goal is to redraw the lines in the Middle East, to protect the natural energy resources, and to further U.S.
[01:26:21.213 --> 01:26:22.834]  and Israeli power in the region.
[01:26:22.874 --> 01:26:24.375]  And that's exactly what we're seeing.
[01:26:24.415 --> 01:26:27.076]  This is an expansion of Israel into Lebanon.
[01:26:27.556 --> 01:26:32.159]  They have troops mapped on the border that were expected to go into southern Lebanon at any moment.
[01:26:32.379 --> 01:26:34.880]  They've already launched many incursions into southern Lebanon.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:41.204]  And really everyone here, especially in Syria, is afraid that this is likely to spread over here.
[01:26:41.604 --> 01:26:45.766]  Dar, the controlled press is saying that there's over 400 dead.
[01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:50.369]  Israeli generals are saying don't count the dead as they level entire apartment buildings.
[01:26:51.149 --> 01:27:04.217]  You know, being there right, you know, just miles from the bombs dropping and getting more news, you know, near the source than we are, what's the real number, an estimation of dead reckoning, of how many dead we've got in Lebanon?
[01:27:07.528 --> 01:27:18.272]  Well, the absolute minimum number right now is 350, but that number is... I think you could probably easily add another third again onto that, because there are many, many people missing.
[01:27:18.392 --> 01:27:22.134]  I mean, my personal example, I think, I would like to cite where
[01:27:22.814 --> 01:27:28.315]  We have many, many cousins that we've not heard from them since this began.
[01:27:29.256 --> 01:27:31.036]  We're talking about 10 people just like that.
[01:27:31.276 --> 01:27:34.477]  How many other instances are there with so many people missing?
[01:27:34.517 --> 01:27:52.121]  We don't even have numbers right now on how many people total are missing, but absolutely for sure from the hospital there's over 350 dead at this point, over 1,250 wounded, and I think for sure as this continues, it's guaranteed to continue at least another week and days.
[01:27:57.784 --> 01:27:59.025]  Dar, you're breaking up there at the end.
[01:27:59.045 --> 01:28:01.026]  When we come back, repeat what you had to say.
[01:28:02.487 --> 01:28:08.331]  Israel looks like it's mashing for a full-scale invasion, saying they may invade and take a third of the country, quote bumper.
[01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:14.875]  They've also made cryptic statements about attacking Syria, so give us your take on that when we return.
[01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:15.355]  Okay, Dar?
[01:28:17.885 --> 01:28:18.145]  Okay.
[01:28:18.646 --> 01:28:19.246]  Fantastic.
[01:28:19.266 --> 01:28:20.887]  There's about a two-second delay, folks.
[01:28:21.367 --> 01:28:26.250]  He is very close to the war-torn area there in northern Lebanon.
[01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:30.372]  He's very close, a few miles from the border, where the bombs are dropping.
[01:28:30.412 --> 01:28:33.034]  Darja Maul, veteran combat journalist, joins us.
[01:28:33.454 --> 01:28:38.337]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, right here, bringing you continual coverage from the front lines.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.721]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.221 --> 01:28:46.702]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.715 --> 01:28:50.404]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.176 --> 01:28:59.978]  September 11, 2001 changed the world, and the world is now realizing that the official story of that infamous day just doesn't make sense.
[01:29:00.298 --> 01:29:05.340]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that there is a government cover-up, according to a CNN poll.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:13.743]  9-11 in plain sight, the director's cut is a compilation of unaltered news footage and photos from major networks and publications that raises questions that officials dare not ask, let alone answer.
[01:29:14.123 --> 01:29:22.026]  The worldwide firestorm of questions raised has forced some into a position of desperation damage control to keep this documentary from being seen or accepted by the masses.
[01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:27.250]  Why have these efforts been made to keep you from seeing this documentary and simply asking common sense questions?
[01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.890]  Find out.
[01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:32.493]  You must see 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut and share it with as many people as possible.

[01:29:43.801 --> 01:29:44.442]  Stop this madness.

[01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:57.520]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.060]  are located?
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.661]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:30:53.360 --> 01:31:00.202]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[01:31:00.482 --> 01:31:06.044]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[01:31:06.364 --> 01:31:12.907]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:31:13.147 --> 01:31:19.929]  This patented steel reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:29.231]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:31:29.471 --> 01:31:32.952]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.

[01:31:37.052 --> 01:31:44.334]  With Nuclear World War 3 looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey ready for a new owner.

[01:31:58.743 --> 01:32:04.446]  Dar Jamal, he's got his bios, one of his great reports.
[01:32:05.127 --> 01:32:05.587]  Hop on.
[01:32:06.451 --> 01:32:07.692]  Infowars.com right now.
[01:32:07.732 --> 01:32:10.074]  That's the main site of all my sites, of my eight sites.
[01:32:10.094 --> 01:32:13.738]  That's where we'll have continual coverage throughout this entire escalating conflict.
[01:32:14.018 --> 01:32:17.061]  You see, you have a military dictatorship government in Israel.
[01:32:17.341 --> 01:32:18.442]  They manipulate the Knesset.
[01:32:18.462 --> 01:32:19.323]  They stage events.
[01:32:19.583 --> 01:32:20.884]  They oppress even the Jewish people.
[01:32:20.924 --> 01:32:22.966]  The majority there are against all of this.
[01:32:22.986 --> 01:32:24.608]  It's a huge bully.
[01:32:24.668 --> 01:32:27.671]  It's Goliath picking on David, basically.
[01:32:29.432 --> 01:32:30.133]  Hezbollah.
[01:32:30.965 --> 01:32:35.688]  He is responding with rockets after major military bombardments.
[01:32:35.768 --> 01:32:37.009]  Our media spins that.
[01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:42.272]  And then you have evidence of Israel funding radical elements of Hezbollah in the past and founding Hamas.
[01:32:42.312 --> 01:32:44.553]  So that's all very, very suspicious as well.
[01:32:44.573 --> 01:32:50.297]  You have the Christians there being heavily bombarded when they're supposedly allies of the Israelis.
[01:32:50.597 --> 01:32:51.618]  Dar Jamal joins us.
[01:32:51.978 --> 01:32:54.259]  Dar, geopolitically, where do you see this going?
[01:32:54.279 --> 01:32:55.340]  It doesn't look like Israel
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:56.641]  We're good to go!
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:30.562]  So clearly this looks like they're trying to escalate towards a full-scale theater war.
[01:33:30.642 --> 01:33:34.564]  Now the FBI is saying Hezbollah and Hamas made bomb sites in the U.S.
[01:33:34.844 --> 01:33:42.328]  Clearly that could be our own government then trying to blame that on foreign countries as a type of Gulf of Tonkin
[01:33:43.770 --> 01:33:44.811]  self-inflicted wound.
[01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:47.496]  We could see this escalate to World War III very quickly.
[01:33:47.816 --> 01:33:51.021]  Newt Gingrich and Crystal and others are calling this World War III.
[01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:52.263]  Where do you see this going?
[01:33:52.463 --> 01:33:55.949]  Dar Jamal from the border there in Syria where the bombs are dropping.
[01:33:58.712 --> 01:34:00.753]  Well, you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:34:01.153 --> 01:34:09.817]  I think that's the worrisome thing, that this is going to spread to Syria and Iran, and I think really the broader plan for the neocons is for it to do exactly that.
[01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:16.860]  I think by them attacking Hezbollah and now Lebanon and totally destabilizing the entire region.
[01:34:17.261 --> 01:34:22.263]  Now, they are trying to make these direct linkages exactly as you
[01:34:22.904 --> 01:34:37.581]  Okay, Iran, they want to join them into one entity, to blame one and to blame all of them, drag them into this and therefore legitimize an open, broad strike against Syria and especially against Iran and that's exactly what we see.
[01:34:38.729 --> 01:34:56.244]  ...Israeli government doing, whether they're military officials or political officials, are saying, consistently drawing links, this is about Iran, this is about Syria, this is terrorism, this is Hezbollah, and basically saying that repeatedly ad nauseam until it all runs together.
[01:34:56.484 --> 01:35:03.870]  It's total brainwashing, it's total propaganda, because really what this is about is Hezbollah defending itself now against this
[01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:17.837]  I really want to underscore the fact that what we're seeing here, and it's being broadcast 24-7 on Al Jazeera, of just utter, total destruction in Lebanon.
[01:35:17.877 --> 01:35:22.499]  They have turned southern Beirut and much of the south of Lebanon into the moon.
[01:35:22.519 --> 01:35:25.801]  I mean, you look at this footage, it's just entire blocks, entire
[01:35:26.351 --> 01:35:30.175]  Lots of cities are literally bombed and smoldering on the ground.
[01:35:30.236 --> 01:35:32.798]  Just huge piles of rubble where buildings used to be.
[01:35:33.259 --> 01:35:36.583]  There's over half a million people now displaced within Lebanon.
[01:35:36.943 --> 01:35:40.047]  Over 140,000 of those have fled over here to Syria.
[01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:44.592]  It's a total catastrophe at the hands of this Israeli aggression.
[01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:45.933]  Of course, completely supported
[01:35:48.007 --> 01:36:03.455]  And what we're seeing over here is really a very different story, because the Arab media is looking at Hezbollah as having, of course, a right to defend itself, just like Israel is saying over and over that it has a right to defend itself.
[01:36:03.795 --> 01:36:12.960]  But the reality over here is that Hezbollah enjoys a very broad support throughout the Arab world, simply because they're standing up to this U.S.-Israel aggression.
[01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:18.080]  Well it is American made bombs predominantly that are dropping.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:26.110]  Talk about some of the munitions that are pounding some of these cities and towns and describe the type of targets that are being hit that is being filtered out by our media.
[01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:38.468]  Primarily 500 pound bombs in urban city centers, which is of course a war crime because it's indiscriminate because so many civilians are being killed.
[01:36:38.788 --> 01:36:42.949]  Approximately 4% of all the dead in Lebanon are actually fighters.
[01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:45.810]  All of the other 96% are civilians.
[01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:48.772]  They are using F-16 fighter jets primarily.
[01:36:48.832 --> 01:36:53.553]  They're using Apache attack helicopters given to them by the U.S.
[01:36:53.573 --> 01:36:55.094]  They're using Tomahawk
[01:36:55.996 --> 01:36:56.436]  Missiles.
[01:36:56.996 --> 01:37:00.297]  Another massacre with at least 15,000 troops to push into southern Lebanon.
[01:37:00.577 --> 01:37:03.617]  They are using M1 Abrams tanks, Humvees, and Jeeps.
[01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:09.958]  There also have been reports, I should add, of white phosphorus being used already in southern Lebanon.
[01:37:10.739 --> 01:37:13.539]  So far we don't have reports on chemical weapons.
[01:37:14.179 --> 01:37:17.460]  White phosphorus has certainly been used along with all the other bombs.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:24.661]  And the targets that they're hitting are primarily, it's the most blatant act of collective punishment I've ever seen in my life.
[01:37:25.061 --> 01:37:31.442]  Even surpassing what I saw in Fallujah, where they're attacking civilian homes, civilian neighborhoods.
[01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:34.403]  They rocketed grain silos up in Tripoli.
[01:37:34.663 --> 01:37:38.624]  I guess they felt threatened of being attacked by some terrorist grain up in Tripoli.
[01:37:38.984 --> 01:37:42.444]  They've knocked out the airport, the main airport in Beirut.
[01:37:42.464 --> 01:37:44.085]  They've knocked out most of the ports.
[01:37:44.605 --> 01:37:46.805]  They have warships off the coast.
[01:37:46.865 --> 01:37:51.646]  They're pounding different parts of Lebanon, not letting anyone enter or out without their permission.
[01:37:52.638 --> 01:37:55.562]  And they continue to attack things like telephone exchanges.
[01:37:55.642 --> 01:37:56.823]  They've bombed hospitals.
[01:37:57.243 --> 01:38:06.794]  Al Jazeera reported a couple of days ago they even attacked a convoy of ambulances from other countries that collected aid and tried to bring it in to people suffering in Lebanon.
[01:38:07.054 --> 01:38:08.656]  They're attacking civilian cars.
[01:38:09.037 --> 01:38:10.798]  They've bombed refugee camps.
[01:38:11.359 --> 01:38:12.560]  The list goes on, Alex.
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.882]  It's an absolute atrocity.
[01:38:15.405 --> 01:38:30.599]  Wayne Madison, who we found to be extremely credible in the past, of course worked for the NSA, has photos, mainstream photos, of Israelis with huge chemical weapon pods that are filled with some type of chemical agent.
[01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:36.275]  And the Wayne Madison report that the Israeli military was using poison gas on villages in South Lebanon according to a former U.S.
[01:38:36.295 --> 01:38:37.976]  weapons expert who served in Iraq.
[01:38:37.996 --> 01:38:48.202]  The artillery shell in the photo taken in Lebanon below is a chemical weapon delivery device that is being handled by an Israeli Defense Force soldier in Hebrew lettering and can be clearly seen on the armored vehicle.
[01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:52.185]  Another chemical weapon shell of the same type can be seen lying on the ground to his right.
[01:38:52.525 --> 01:38:56.949]  It is not known what type of chemical is in the chemical canister, but it clearly is that.
[01:38:57.229 --> 01:39:03.494]  However, gas dropped by the Israelis in villages in south Lebanon has resulted in severe vomiting among the civilian population.
[01:39:03.814 --> 01:39:09.678]  Media commentators have scoffed at Israel, which has relatively unique history, would ever use chemical weapons or poison gas in any war.
[01:39:10.019 --> 01:39:12.781]  It is precisely because of that perception that they are using such weapons
[01:39:13.141 --> 01:39:20.106]  The liability factor prevents the media from taking seriously the credibility reports of banned weapons being used by Israelis.
[01:39:20.847 --> 01:39:28.672]  And it shows a Jane's Weapons Quarterly diagram of the exact type of chemical weapons, munition, rocket delivery system.
[01:39:29.052 --> 01:39:31.574]  Israel using chemical delivery weapons in Lebanon.
[01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:36.638]  Fuse and chemical canister can be easily seen in photo of an Israeli Defense Force personnel in Lebanon.
[01:39:37.158 --> 01:39:41.541]  Drawing on chemical weapons is from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
[01:39:41.861 --> 01:39:42.382]  Comments, Dar?
[01:39:45.263 --> 01:39:52.427]  Well, that really is not going to surprise me at all once we start hearing more reports like this, because I think they've pulled out all the stops.
[01:39:52.747 --> 01:39:57.949]  We have officials in the Israeli military and government saying, this is the beginning of the end.
[01:39:58.029 --> 01:40:01.191]  I mean, and I'm quoting, they are saying, this is the beginning of the end.
[01:40:01.591 --> 01:40:02.952]  This is their go time.
[01:40:02.972 --> 01:40:13.238]  They are going to use this opportunity to pull out all the stops and use everything at their disposal to try to take Hezbollah out of the picture and draw Iran and Syria into this conflict.
[01:40:13.278 --> 01:40:14.719]  So it's not surprising.
[01:40:15.179 --> 01:40:23.124]  I would be absolutely shocked if they don't end up using chemical weapons in Southern Lebanon, if they haven't already, which they may well have.
[01:40:23.204 --> 01:40:28.247]  The problem with Southern Lebanon now is it has been pounded so much, all of the roads between
[01:40:28.747 --> 01:40:35.669]  Southern Lebanon and Beirut are cut short of little farm roads, which people are using to try to escape the massacre.
[01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:40.390]  And to move into that area, it's very, very difficult to get.
[01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:43.611]  So those types of weapons may well have already been used.
[01:40:43.691 --> 01:40:47.032]  And the problem here is that Israel is a rogue state.
[01:40:47.092 --> 01:40:52.253]  They are launching aggression, as they have in the occupied Palestinian territories for decades.
[01:40:52.473 --> 01:40:56.214]  They've been launching these really unbridled aggressions.
[01:40:56.667 --> 01:41:03.790]  Dar, are you worried that Israel or our own government could stage some type of terror attack here in the U.S.
[01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:06.952]  or another western area as a provocation to radically expand?
[01:41:07.232 --> 01:41:07.912]  That's number one.
[01:41:07.952 --> 01:41:17.477]  Then number two, we know a large part of Bush's administration and Fox News and other key neocon arms are dual citizenship, really Israeli Mossad agents.
[01:41:18.217 --> 01:41:24.260]  Should the American people be worried about having a foreign government attempting to take control of our government?
[01:41:27.151 --> 01:41:46.384]  Well, it certainly would just be speculation on my part, but that said, I couldn't imagine a scenario that would play better into their hands than an attack in the United States, and then blaming Father Hezbollah, and therefore linking it directly to Iran.
[01:41:51.587 --> 01:41:58.291]  Dar, what about the second question about these dual loyalty open Israeli government officials basically in our government?
[01:42:20.714 --> 01:42:26.518]  Well, that's been going on for decades.
[01:42:26.638 --> 01:42:28.379]  It might have been longer.
[01:42:28.439 --> 01:42:37.185]  We've had gross instances of Israeli spies, people like... Dar?
[01:42:37.345 --> 01:42:37.745]  Dar?
[01:42:37.845 --> 01:42:42.068]  Dar, I'm going to have to stop you.
[01:42:42.668 --> 01:42:43.889]  I need you to repeat what you were saying.
[01:42:43.929 --> 01:42:45.650]  Your phone's really starting to break up.
[01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:46.811]  Answer that question again, please.
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:43:02.163]  Yeah, it's very clear that these linkages, that these people wearing both hats in the United States government, being members of Mossad, passing on information, spies, this has been going on for decades.
[01:43:02.243 --> 01:43:09.105]  And now, I think we're looking at the apex of that campaign where we have a government
[01:43:10.365 --> 01:43:15.489]  If we have entire areas of cities level, we could see thousands and thousands dead, not 500, 600.
[01:43:42.492 --> 01:43:43.352]  That's correct.
[01:43:43.413 --> 01:43:57.899]  I think that when we look at the scale of the destruction, these preliminary numbers, similar to what happened in Fallujah, I want to cite an example where the initial numbers coming out were in the hundreds.
[01:43:57.919 --> 01:44:03.162]  It wasn't until the bodies continued to be pulled from underneath.
[01:44:03.803 --> 01:44:04.203]  We're good to go.
[01:44:32.123 --> 01:44:37.327]  Darjamal, in closing here in the last few minutes we've got left with you and your phone's getting worse and worse.
[01:44:38.488 --> 01:44:42.851]  In closing, how do you see this playing out in the next two weeks, the next month?
[01:44:43.351 --> 01:44:44.552]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:52.838]  Well, absolutely I would be shocked if the Israeli aggression against Lebanon didn't continue to increase.
[01:44:53.557 --> 01:44:59.240]  As ground troops roll in and the combat sorties continue to be flown for at least the next ten days to two weeks.
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:09.426]  But I fear that in the next few months that it's only a matter of time before Syria and Iran get pulled into this, because that's what the Israeli government and that's what the U.S.
[01:45:09.466 --> 01:45:10.847]  government want to see happen.
[01:45:11.507 --> 01:45:20.812]  Dar, isn't this invasion of southern Lebanon, which has already happened now, tens of thousands of troops now there in southern Lebanon, Israeli forces,
[01:45:22.288 --> 01:45:24.389]  Isn't this really the road to Damascus?
[01:45:24.889 --> 01:45:32.992]  Because if they want to invade Damascus, they've got to secure their northern flank in preparation so Hezbollah cannot attack.
[01:45:33.713 --> 01:45:35.373]  I think that's really what they want to do.
[01:45:35.393 --> 01:45:46.498]  I think they really do want to pull Damascus into this, and the best way to do that is by invading southern Lebanon, because that's what pulled Damascus into Lebanon back in the 80s.
[01:45:46.778 --> 01:45:48.699]  So they're securing their flank right now?
[01:45:52.449 --> 01:45:53.809]  Very much so, yes.
[01:45:53.869 --> 01:45:56.270]  And the Syrian military is on high alert.
[01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:58.932]  They do not want the Israelis to push into southern Lebanon.
[01:45:59.092 --> 01:46:02.834]  That's going to take this whole situation to another frightening level.
[01:46:03.034 --> 01:46:06.015]  It's going to be very hard for Syria to stay out of this conflict.
[01:46:06.495 --> 01:46:10.017]  I would like to point out that Syria has been groveling and licking Israel's boots.
[01:46:10.157 --> 01:46:12.018]  I follow their diplomacy, folks.
[01:46:12.098 --> 01:46:13.839]  It's sad to see them grovel.
[01:46:14.891 --> 01:46:17.032]  But it's an 800-pound gorilla on their back.
[01:46:17.472 --> 01:46:19.233]  Then Iran's tried to write letters.
[01:46:19.273 --> 01:46:24.434]  They've tried to have some detente, though I know they've had some CIA connections and some staged events in the past.
[01:46:26.595 --> 01:46:29.036]  So really, a lot of countries have been trying to roll over.
[01:46:30.596 --> 01:46:31.577]  Number one, do you agree with that?
[01:46:31.617 --> 01:46:34.978]  Number two, does it look like that Israel just doesn't care what they do?
[01:46:34.998 --> 01:46:35.898]  They're going to escalate this?
[01:46:39.031 --> 01:46:59.190]  Well, I think what has to be taken into account that Syria is a very weak military and will try to avoid a conflict with Israel, a very powerful military, very powerful nuclear power, the only nuclear power here in the Middle East, and of course we see the lunatics running that country who would absolutely not hesitate to use nuclear weapons.
[01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:01.752]  So, for those reasons, I think Syria and Iran
[01:47:02.279 --> 01:47:09.831]  Are trying to stay out of this history for their own survivability, but I think that the Israelis do want to push it to that level.
[01:47:10.376 --> 01:47:28.264]  With the full backing of the United States government, and I think that we're looking at something that, if this continues to progress and nothing changes in the coming months, we are looking at sort of an end-time scenario over here, because the use of nuclear weapons is always very much a possibility when you have a rogue state like Israel.
[01:47:28.504 --> 01:47:33.706]  And there's all these good old boys that go, turn it into a parking lot, who are just totally mindless.
[01:47:33.746 --> 01:47:37.348]  You know, I know a lot of Lebanese people, very intelligent, very informed,
[01:47:38.544 --> 01:47:39.524]  Very sophisticated.
[01:47:39.985 --> 01:47:40.725]  They're not stupid.
[01:47:40.765 --> 01:47:44.046]  They know we're puppets of the new world order now here in the U.S.
[01:47:44.506 --> 01:47:48.428]  They know what's unfolding, and they're so sad about all of this.
[01:47:48.468 --> 01:47:55.070]  The image of the turbaned psychopath boning at the mouth is really a stereotype.
[01:47:55.777 --> 01:47:58.258]  But I do hear the neocons calling to talk radio.
[01:47:58.579 --> 01:47:59.839]  They are the stereotype.
[01:48:00.099 --> 01:48:04.222]  They can't find Iraq or Damascus or Lebanon or Beirut on a map.
[01:48:04.662 --> 01:48:08.564]  They know nothing about history, but they've got all their mindless opinions, Darth.
[01:48:12.386 --> 01:48:19.870]  Yeah, and that's due primarily to the ecology in the U.S., which is basically saying it's comparable to state media.
[01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:22.692]  In my opinion, most people are so
[01:48:23.314 --> 01:48:23.894]  We're good to go.
[01:48:40.201 --> 01:48:44.264]  So many people there, more and more, are supporting the government out of total fear.
[01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:45.865]  They're buying all the propaganda.
[01:48:46.145 --> 01:48:49.047]  And that, of course, can greatly lead to this crisis.
[01:48:49.367 --> 01:48:52.229]  Do you think this is going to help Bush with the midterm elections for Congress?
[01:48:52.249 --> 01:48:57.092]  Do you think it's going to help Olmert cover up the scandals on bribery and sex that he's got in Israel?
[01:49:02.655 --> 01:49:06.958]  Well, without a doubt, we've got a government there that is as corrupt as what would be
[01:49:08.047 --> 01:49:08.648]  We're good to go.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.665]  Well, I am going to be going into Lebanon quite soon, so hopefully next time we talk, it'll be from there.
[01:49:44.925 --> 01:49:46.286]  You know my Showtime hours.
[01:49:46.427 --> 01:49:49.149]  Anytime you want to call in, you've got preference.

[01:49:56.707 --> 01:49:57.167]  It's here!
[01:49:57.387 --> 01:50:02.169]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:10.193]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.853 --> 01:50:17.896]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.316 --> 01:50:25.179]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.703 --> 01:50:29.746]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.046 --> 01:50:33.529]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:35.930]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:40.173]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:54.839 --> 01:53:05.784]  An amazing interview with Dr. Jamal from just a few miles from the border where bombs are dropping right now.
[01:53:07.481 --> 01:53:15.308]  Thousands and thousands of Saudis by F-16s and F-15s dropping 500 and 1,000 pound bombs right on top of apartment buildings.
[01:53:17.009 --> 01:53:21.473]  When you hear 400 dead and now the news is saying maybe more, that is nothing.
[01:53:22.213 --> 01:53:28.158]  In a month from now when nobody is paying attention it will be 10,000 were killed and 50 Israelis.
[01:53:28.178 --> 01:53:29.679]  50 Israelis died and 10,000 of the evil devil Arabs.
[01:53:35.063 --> 01:53:37.604]  Curse them once, curse them twice, curse them thrice.
[01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:40.825]  And then this will further radicalize the Arabs.
[01:53:40.845 --> 01:53:47.446]  Can you imagine being Iran, where our government openly, with the British, overthrew their government by carrying out terror attacks and blaming it on their leader?
[01:53:49.167 --> 01:53:52.087]  Who was pro-America, by the way, and wore a suit and tie?
[01:53:52.107 --> 01:53:55.508]  And was Western-schooled?
[01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:57.289]  Pro-US!
[01:53:57.329 --> 01:53:57.949]  Anti-Communist!
[01:53:58.763 --> 01:54:09.545]  You imagine if a government had come to the U.S., overthrown our government, put a dictatorship in that arrested your mama and your daddy and tortured them to death, and then you'd gotten back control of your country, how much would you hate us?
[01:54:10.865 --> 01:54:16.667]  But see, the average idiot driving along in their car out there that, TURN THEM INTO A PARKING LOT!
[01:54:17.267 --> 01:54:18.887]  They don't know Bush is for open borders.
[01:54:18.927 --> 01:54:20.287]  They don't know Bush is anti-gun.
[01:54:20.507 --> 01:54:22.968]  They don't know Bush is a blackmailed puppet of the New World Order.
[01:54:24.531 --> 01:54:28.772]  They don't know that there's an American Union openly being set up at the end of our country.
[01:54:29.512 --> 01:54:37.414]  They don't know that our corporations are so evil that they killed hundreds of thousands of hemophiliacs in this country alone, knowingly allowing AIDS virus in their drugs.
[01:54:39.274 --> 01:54:42.155]  Oh, it's mainstream news at the back of the paper, reported once or twice there.
[01:54:42.755 --> 01:54:45.076]  I mean, have the Muslims killed hundreds of thousands of us?
[01:54:45.536 --> 01:54:45.816]  Oh, no.
[01:54:45.996 --> 01:54:47.256]  But that's our companies.
[01:54:47.296 --> 01:54:49.777]  The media hasn't scared us with reports on them.
[01:54:51.954 --> 01:54:54.137]  Does Hezbollah put mercury in your vaccines?
[01:54:54.697 --> 01:54:57.761]  Oh no, they won't let the UN in there and they won't take vaccines over there.
[01:54:58.562 --> 01:54:59.503]  Because they don't trust them.
[01:54:59.743 --> 01:55:05.951]  Because they're not stupid, naive idiots brainwashed on television for 50 plus years.
[01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:09.871]  I'm not saying the Muslims are perfect.
[01:55:09.911 --> 01:55:10.951]  Some countries are free.
[01:55:11.011 --> 01:55:11.632]  Some are evil.
[01:55:11.652 --> 01:55:13.212]  Some are very corrupt.
[01:55:13.252 --> 01:55:14.752]  There's nutty sex over there.
[01:55:15.352 --> 01:55:17.012]  It'll kill you for a piece of bubble gum.
[01:55:17.433 --> 01:55:25.634]  But compared to the Joe Six-Pack, Mr. Tough Guy Football Sticker, blow and kill all them kids up with nukes!
[01:55:26.874 --> 01:55:27.574]  Nukes!
[01:55:30.115 --> 01:55:32.955]  You don't even know how a nuclear weapon operates, you stupid twits.
[01:55:33.935 --> 01:55:36.276]  You don't even know how it's designed, what would happen.
[01:55:36.316 --> 01:55:36.716]  You're just fools.
[01:55:38.348 --> 01:55:39.410]  I like DU.
[01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:40.611]  It's good for you.
[01:55:40.912 --> 01:55:44.957]  I'm glad lung cancer's up six-fold in the last ten years in the U.S.
[01:55:44.997 --> 01:55:45.338]  from it.
[01:55:46.019 --> 01:55:47.821]  I want to die of lung cancer!
[01:55:49.643 --> 01:55:49.964]  You're fools!
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:55.843]  We have a global government run by global international bankers destroying the U.S.
[01:55:55.903 --> 01:55:59.585]  right now, and the very same people doing that are trying to bring in war in the Middle East.
[01:56:00.126 --> 01:56:05.910]  Israel is being used as a set piece to expand the widening war over there, which I know you'll cheerlead.
[01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:08.011]  We'll get hit by some terrorist attacks.
[01:56:08.091 --> 01:56:09.572]  It'll be government stage, guaranteed.
[01:56:09.592 --> 01:56:12.874]  Then we'll have a national draft, and you'll be like, arrest the traitors!
[01:56:12.894 --> 01:56:14.055]  Arrest Alex Jones!
[01:56:14.335 --> 01:56:21.160]  He's the type of person that kept us from defending ourselves, and then we got hit by an A-bomb that the Arabs had!
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.161]  The Arabs!
[01:56:23.181 --> 01:56:24.402]  I've heard them call it that.
[01:56:25.263 --> 01:56:27.384]  It's between Arab and Iranian.
[01:56:27.404 --> 01:56:30.867]  Of course, Arabs aren't... Iranians aren't Arabs, but Arabs!
[01:56:32.748 --> 01:56:38.813]  We've got to get rid of free speech and have secret police everywhere, because America got hit!
[01:56:39.597 --> 01:56:43.320]  We gotta go over there and get them before they get us!
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:51.207]  Well, maybe if for 200 years the Western world hadn't been running around slaughtering and stealing and killing Arabs, they wouldn't hate us!
[01:56:51.647 --> 01:56:54.390]  And by the way, I know a lot of Arabs, but most of them don't hate us!
[01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:55.611]  They know we're a bunch of idiots!
[01:56:58.353 --> 01:57:01.776]  Get my new film, Terror Storm, and learn the truth.
[01:57:03.197 --> 01:57:06.060]  Learn the truth about who's behind the terrorism.
[01:57:08.928 --> 01:57:09.628]  It's unbelievable.

[01:57:21.075 --> 01:57:21.895]  My new film is out.
[01:57:21.955 --> 01:57:23.216]  It is unbelievably good.
[01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:24.636]  It is powerful.
[01:57:25.077 --> 01:57:25.857]  It's up to you now.
[01:57:25.937 --> 01:57:27.298]  We've given you the ball.
[01:57:27.358 --> 01:57:27.818]  Run with it.
[01:57:28.378 --> 01:57:29.359]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:29.399 --> 01:57:30.560]  Your calls, tons of news.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:31.140]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:36.512]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:36.592 --> 01:57:37.333]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.373 --> 01:57:37.793]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:37.813 --> 01:57:38.654]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:38.714 --> 01:57:39.194]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.397 --> 01:57:57.278]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.298 --> 01:58:01.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.263]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.027 --> 01:58:21.452]  Well, in the first hour, Cybele Edmonds, the big national security whistleblower about government involvement in 9-11, that went further than she's ever gone,
[01:58:23.937 --> 01:58:28.344]  Saying clearly the evidence points towards our government being involved in 9-11.
[01:58:28.364 --> 01:58:30.607]  Oh yes.
[01:58:31.509 --> 01:58:35.875]  And that the facts point that direction and she wouldn't be surprised if they weren't involved in it.
[01:58:36.376 --> 01:58:39.661]  That is huge that she'd say more but she's got gag orders on her.
[01:58:41.181 --> 01:58:53.312]  That their cover-up is so big, it just shows even more guilt than we had Darja Maul, veteran combat journalist from Fallujah, Baghdad, you name it, right there on the border with Syria and Lebanon as the bombardment intensifies.
[01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:55.094]  Whole areas of cities being leveled.
[01:58:55.534 --> 01:58:58.497]  Untold burping on air, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:58.977 --> 01:59:02.560]  That's when you try to eat your barbecue sandwich in 30-second turn brakes.
[01:59:03.721 --> 01:59:04.262]  Excuse me.
[01:59:05.754 --> 01:59:06.835]  This is real radio, folks.
[01:59:06.855 --> 01:59:08.737]  It doesn't get any more real than this.
[01:59:10.958 --> 01:59:11.719]  That's what's happening.
[01:59:11.739 --> 01:59:12.500]  That's what's going on.
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:13.781]  We're taking your calls.
[01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:15.802]  Now, I'm going crazy in this hour.
[01:59:16.363 --> 01:59:18.965]  I don't care how good your calls are, how good your points are.
[01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:24.670]  I'm moving to the next person within 60 seconds because I want to get everybody on board on the show.
[01:59:26.251 --> 01:59:29.554]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Michigan.
[01:59:29.574 --> 01:59:30.114]  Go ahead, David.
[01:59:30.134 --> 01:59:31.515]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:32.406 --> 01:59:38.688]  Well, first off, I want to say I was linked to your site by Norm Breyfogle, the great, great Batman artist from the late 80s and throughout the 1990s.
[01:59:38.748 --> 01:59:45.970]  I don't know how many listeners of yours know who he is, but Norm Breyfogle, he was the premier artist on all the Batman comics during that time.
[01:59:46.030 --> 01:59:48.930]  I think he did a great, great job with comic book art.
[01:59:49.431 --> 01:59:53.692]  But the bigger point I wanted to get to, and this is where I'm going to put the... Let me stop you.
[01:59:53.732 --> 01:59:54.732]  I'm totally confused.
[01:59:55.587 --> 01:59:57.831]  Batman Websites?
[01:59:57.871 --> 02:00:06.066]  I'm sorry, I was just going to say, well Norm Bravefold was a great Batman artist on the line of Batman comics from the late 80s throughout the 1990s.
[02:00:09.308 --> 02:00:10.128]  He has a website now.
[02:00:10.168 --> 02:00:11.389]  He doesn't do Batman comic books anymore.
[02:00:11.409 --> 02:00:11.889]  He does others.
[02:00:12.489 --> 02:00:15.411]  But he has a website and a message board and stuff like that.
[02:00:15.431 --> 02:00:17.532]  And he provides periodically.
[02:00:17.552 --> 02:00:19.033]  He'll link to your stories and stuff like that.
[02:00:19.073 --> 02:00:19.753]  So that's how I got here.
[02:00:19.833 --> 02:00:20.354]  Oh, really?
[02:00:20.434 --> 02:00:22.155]  A famous Batman illustrator?
[02:00:22.195 --> 02:00:23.015]  Well, I'm honored.
[02:00:23.075 --> 02:00:23.916]  Send me a link to it.
[02:00:24.296 --> 02:00:24.816]  Oh, I sure will.
[02:00:24.856 --> 02:00:25.917]  Norm Brayfogle is his name.
[02:00:26.217 --> 02:00:30.039]  There might be a couple of other listeners of yours who know who he is.
[02:00:30.179 --> 02:00:31.260]  Okay, go ahead and make your other point.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.361]  It's kind of a broad point.
[02:00:33.601 --> 02:00:35.983]  It doesn't touch on anything specific like Israel or 9-11.
[02:00:36.003 --> 02:00:36.703]  But I just want to say, like,
[02:00:37.102 --> 02:00:41.486]  Everyone talks about how we need to spread the information, and we need to shine a light on all these things.
[02:00:41.506 --> 02:00:43.788]  And I agree, of course.
[02:00:44.268 --> 02:00:47.151]  Diagnosis is the first step toward rehabilitation, as they say in medicine.
[02:00:47.631 --> 02:00:56.959]  But I guess the bigger point I'm making is, even if every single person knows, like every single person in Arizona wants a fence built up along the Mexican border, right?
[02:00:57.319 --> 02:00:59.121]  And every single person wants something done.
[02:00:59.602 --> 02:01:00.583]  Nothing happened, still.
[02:01:00.663 --> 02:01:12.434]  And I guess my bigger point is, like, even if everyone knows, like, if everyone sheds their stupid identities as tough guys and stops saying all the, you know, kill the Arabs stuff and, you know, they stop pretending, you know, all the 9-11 lies, even if everyone just, you know,
[02:01:12.901 --> 02:01:14.621]  You know, let's go with the lies and admit the truth.
[02:01:14.641 --> 02:01:15.602]  Like, what can we do?
[02:01:15.682 --> 02:01:18.602]  This isn't like 1776 where you can overthrow the government anymore.
[02:01:18.942 --> 02:01:21.123]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:21.383 --> 02:01:31.145]  Oh man, this concerns the whole philosophy of our fight against the globalists, and I say I'm going to keep a collar on for 60 seconds, but how do I not come back from break and comment on what you just said?
[02:01:31.185 --> 02:01:38.506]  It's such a pivotal pillar of everything we're doing in our strategy, but finish up.
[02:01:39.222 --> 02:01:44.986]  I just want to say that anxiety is caused primarily on a psychological level.
[02:01:45.267 --> 02:01:48.008]  It's caused by not having control over your immediate environment.
[02:01:48.028 --> 02:01:52.111]  That's why being stuck in traffic jams is one of the number one causes of anxiety.
[02:01:52.492 --> 02:01:59.477]  Constantly dwelling on these problems, as real as they are, I'm a firm believer in the governance of 9-11 and various other things that you talk about.
[02:01:59.497 --> 02:02:02.659]  If you let it get to you, it's going to cause you a lot of anxiety.
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:09.002]  As I say, anxiety stems from worrying about things that you can't control.
[02:02:09.022 --> 02:02:10.583]  So I just wanted to note that for your listeners.
[02:02:11.023 --> 02:02:11.404]  Thank you.
[02:02:11.444 --> 02:02:16.947]  I appreciate your call and I'll briefly comment on the two things you brought up in that last statement when we get back.
[02:02:17.447 --> 02:02:26.793]  Then I'll go to Lauren in Tennessee, Michael in Texas, Stefan in Canada, and many others.
[02:02:26.813 --> 02:02:26.873]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:30.791 --> 02:02:32.472]  And we will take a lot of your calls in this hour.
[02:02:33.353 --> 02:02:39.658]  I love taking calls because it takes us to so many different angles, brings up so many different subjects and points that we never would have gotten into.
[02:02:39.678 --> 02:02:41.640]  Like what the last call I just did.
[02:02:48.806 --> 02:02:51.987]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.327 --> 02:02:54.228]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.628 --> 02:03:02.310]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.971 --> 02:03:10.013]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.413 --> 02:03:17.295]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.802 --> 02:03:21.864]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:25.627]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.127 --> 02:03:28.048]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.368 --> 02:03:32.291]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.789 --> 02:03:51.292]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.632 --> 02:03:55.734]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.014 --> 02:03:56.575]  We listened.
[02:03:56.875 --> 02:04:01.858]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.138 --> 02:04:02.618]  We listened.
[02:04:02.999 --> 02:04:06.040]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.461 --> 02:04:07.001]  We listened.
[02:04:07.441 --> 02:04:11.525]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.905 --> 02:04:12.406]  We listened.
[02:04:12.746 --> 02:04:17.971]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.392 --> 02:04:19.753]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.113 --> 02:04:27.500]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.881 --> 02:04:30.923]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259
[02:04:37.367 --> 02:04:40.988]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:41.828 --> 02:04:43.248]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:05:45.294 --> 02:05:51.259]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.799 --> 02:05:57.681]  Alright, answering or commenting on the statement of the last caller, David in Michigan.
[02:05:59.722 --> 02:06:06.745]  He said that anxiety is caused, the main cause of anxiety is not having control over your environment.
[02:06:08.726 --> 02:06:09.006]  I.e.
[02:06:09.086 --> 02:06:10.266]  being stuck in a traffic jam.
[02:06:10.286 --> 02:06:11.507]  What is it psychologically?
[02:06:11.527 --> 02:06:14.208]  And it is irritating about being stuck in a traffic jam.
[02:06:14.228 --> 02:06:16.089]  It isn't that you're late or that you can't wait.
[02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:18.970]  It's just that it is horrible to be stuck in something.
[02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:22.673]  But there are other forms of anxiety.
[02:06:23.614 --> 02:06:26.998]  Not taking action against something that you know is going on.
[02:06:27.419 --> 02:06:29.121]  That would drive me over the edge.
[02:06:30.162 --> 02:06:34.328]  I mean, I do have some anxiety about the New World Order and what they're doing and how they're attacking us.
[02:06:35.333 --> 02:06:47.457]  But I know that fighting them is the best course, standing up against them is the only course, and that I'm a lot safer, my family's a lot safer, humanity is in a better position historically in every case.
[02:06:47.497 --> 02:06:52.498]  That's how the cards are dealt, if we stand up and are men and women, and if we have spinal columns.
[02:06:53.699 --> 02:06:56.279]  And so actually, I'm extremely empowered.
[02:06:56.419 --> 02:06:57.100]  I'm in the fight.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:59.160]  I see the victories we're having.
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:00.181]  I see the process.
[02:07:00.221 --> 02:07:00.961]  It's a process.
[02:07:01.301 --> 02:07:05.002]  We're not going to defeat the New World Order overnight, but look at how far we've come.
[02:07:05.723 --> 02:07:13.746]  I mean, five years ago, almost five years ago, when I got on air, it actually is, it'll be five years in four days.
[02:07:13.907 --> 02:07:25.952]  July 25th, 2001, I went on air, I said, the government's going to probably attack the World Trade Center, they'll claim Bin Laden did it, he's their asset, he'll take the blame, and then we're going to have a huge police state crackdown, invasions of countries.
[02:07:26.272 --> 02:07:32.835]  I laid it out, folks, the five-year anniversary of that, two months before 9-11, is coming up in just a few days.
[02:07:32.875 --> 02:07:33.355]  I guess it'll be
[02:07:34.306 --> 02:07:35.549]  It'll be next Tuesday?
[02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.869]  Yeah.
[02:07:37.192 --> 02:07:38.916]  So, that's what we're dealing with here.
[02:07:40.326 --> 02:07:42.928]  is looking at how far we've come.
[02:07:43.008 --> 02:07:50.332]  I mean, who would have thought, who would have stood with me, not many at the first, when I got on air that day and said 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:07:50.712 --> 02:07:55.195]  And I even had other so-called patriots at the TV station walk up to me and go, you've gone too far!
[02:07:55.695 --> 02:07:57.016]  You don't know what you're talking about!
[02:07:57.056 --> 02:07:57.656]  You're nuts!
[02:07:57.696 --> 02:07:59.077]  How dare you, the families!
[02:07:59.498 --> 02:08:06.642]  And I'm like, listen, I've got the documents, I've got Northwoods, I knew about it coming up, I can see all the indicators, so you're going to apologize to me later.
[02:08:06.922 --> 02:08:08.463]  And they did apologize later.
[02:08:08.943 --> 02:08:10.464]  Again, not that I've got all the answers.
[02:08:10.604 --> 02:08:12.205]  I do this 24-7.
[02:08:12.605 --> 02:08:13.906]  This is where my brain's at.
[02:08:14.186 --> 02:08:15.186]  It's where my soul's at.
[02:08:15.206 --> 02:08:18.468]  It's where my intellect is focused.
[02:08:18.828 --> 02:08:20.109]  You can become an expert in anything.
[02:08:20.729 --> 02:08:23.431]  And I really have focused and dedicated my life to this.
[02:08:23.471 --> 02:08:26.592]  I've been aware of government-sponsored terror from the time I woke up.
[02:08:27.373 --> 02:08:31.014]  It's been one of my main focuses because that's one of the globalist's main tools.
[02:08:31.455 --> 02:08:37.178]  So, the caller was saying it could be unhealthy to stay focused on this.
[02:08:37.198 --> 02:08:37.238]  No.
[02:08:39.128 --> 02:08:41.330]  It's unhealthy to not fight it.
[02:08:42.071 --> 02:08:44.053]  It is unhealthy to know about it.
[02:08:44.073 --> 02:08:48.837]  I mean, if you're just going to know about this and do nothing, you might as well just lie to yourself and say it isn't real.
[02:08:50.699 --> 02:09:01.268]  I mean, if you're about to get your head chopped off and you've got some mind trick you can play where you can convince yourself that you're really about to get a haircut, then by all means, enjoy yourself.
[02:09:04.984 --> 02:09:07.846]  Or let's say they're about to kill you by firing squad.
[02:09:07.886 --> 02:09:09.707]  You could take a pill that would make you fall asleep.
[02:09:10.247 --> 02:09:12.208]  You know, by all means, I mean, I guess do it.
[02:09:12.468 --> 02:09:16.690]  If I was going to be killed by firing squad, though, I would want to experience it all right up to the end.
[02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:18.451]  That would be part of my life experiences.
[02:09:19.852 --> 02:09:21.473]  I don't like things like firing squads.
[02:09:21.493 --> 02:09:25.435]  I don't like things like car wrecks or having somebody hit you upside the head with a tire iron.
[02:09:25.475 --> 02:09:29.017]  But that's still part of experiences in life.
[02:09:29.117 --> 02:09:29.837]  I don't want to miss it.
[02:09:30.655 --> 02:09:31.875]  I mean, I want to be there for it.
[02:09:31.895 --> 02:09:33.116]  I mean, I want to see it.
[02:09:33.496 --> 02:09:37.197]  I hope I see it coming and the new world order kills me so I can experience it.
[02:09:41.138 --> 02:09:42.939]  I mean, that's all part of living, folks.
[02:09:43.019 --> 02:09:45.220]  I mean, it's just life is so incredible, all of it.
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:48.140]  But I'm digressing, and I said I'd take calls.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:54.102]  It's just that his second part was... I've been belaboring the first and forgotten the second.
[02:09:54.122 --> 02:09:56.143]  The second was... Oh, yeah!
[02:09:56.849 --> 02:10:24.899]  Yeah, 90-something percent in major polls, and we've seen it in the major Phoenix and Tucson papers, that 90, it was 90, I think 92 percent, I forget, it was a few months ago, they've had several of them, want a fence, want the hordes, millions a year of illegal aliens pouring across just in Cochise County alone, defecating, urinating everywhere, robbing people, burning houses down, raping people, killing other immigrants.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.240]  They want it controlled.
[02:10:28.041 --> 02:10:29.582]  Something like 8% don't.
[02:10:30.523 --> 02:10:34.727]  Total hardcore moron liberals who are just establishment pimps.
[02:10:34.787 --> 02:10:39.971]  I mean, you're so-called liberals but you agree with George Bush who wants open borders for globalism, American Union.
[02:10:40.792 --> 02:10:45.515]  And so, nationally it was 87% in Gallup polls were against open borders.
[02:10:45.976 --> 02:10:51.100]  Now it was 90% a few months ago when the big immigration debate peaked again.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:52.101]  They had a CNN poll.
[02:10:53.132 --> 02:10:56.534]  They had several, and they were all 90%.
[02:10:56.734 --> 02:11:07.141]  So 90% of us, and it's constitutional, it's in the Constitution that we protect our borders, it makes sense, it's common sense, if you buy into the fake thing we're being attacked by terrorists that aren't government, why isn't it secured?
[02:11:08.102 --> 02:11:09.022]  But that doesn't happen.
[02:11:09.422 --> 02:11:19.769]  So you look at that and you say, well 90% of us want it, or 97% of us are against toll roads, but they're still doing it, so we want a fence, we don't get one.
[02:11:20.595 --> 02:11:23.676]  We don't want transponder toll roads on existing roads.
[02:11:23.836 --> 02:11:24.296]  We get it.
[02:11:25.057 --> 02:11:26.737]  Well, see, that means there's nothing we can do.
[02:11:27.118 --> 02:11:27.398]  No, no, no.
[02:11:27.438 --> 02:11:28.598]  That's only part one.
[02:11:28.918 --> 02:11:35.381]  In the past, on most issues, what the people wanted, and what was constitutional, when those two things came together, we got it.
[02:11:37.121 --> 02:11:42.964]  I mean, blacks were a minority, only like 8% of the population, but they stood up and they fought, and most people didn't.
[02:11:43.204 --> 02:11:43.264]  In 1800,
[02:11:45.024 --> 02:11:50.707]  A very small percentage, what, like 10% of Americans were abolitionists or agree with abolitionists.
[02:11:50.727 --> 02:11:56.831]  More like 2 or 3% were hardcore active abolitionists and another 7% or so supported them.
[02:11:57.171 --> 02:12:07.197]  But because that 10% was right, 60-something years later, the majority of people were against slavery in the North and a lot in the South.
[02:12:07.877 --> 02:12:08.978]  Most of them weren't slave owners.
[02:12:08.998 --> 02:12:10.318]  Then it became a states' rights issue.
[02:12:10.839 --> 02:12:12.840]  So, again,
[02:12:13.613 --> 02:12:21.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of what standing up and saying no, even when you're a minority against something that's evil, can do.
[02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:23.301]  We're the majority.
[02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:25.923]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[02:12:25.963 --> 02:12:27.945]  The majority of Hispanics are against open borders.
[02:12:28.245 --> 02:12:30.848]  The media tries to act like Hispanics are for open borders.
[02:12:30.868 --> 02:12:31.388]  They're not.
[02:12:31.708 --> 02:12:35.712]  What is it, 68% in Gallup polls of Hispanics are against open borders?
[02:12:37.933 --> 02:12:39.595]  They'd have you believe that the majority aren't.
[02:12:42.256 --> 02:12:43.277]  For controlling our borders?
[02:12:44.258 --> 02:12:52.103]  And so now that the government is on issue after issue after issue after issue, 70% of the troops want to come home.
[02:12:52.363 --> 02:13:01.350]  70% of the American people, and indexed multiple polls, it's between 69 and 74, depending on what poll you've seen, I know you've seen them, want the troops home, say Iraq's bad.
[02:13:01.670 --> 02:13:04.953]  It doesn't stop, they say another decade at least, permanent bases.
[02:13:05.533 --> 02:13:31.031]  So what you do is, what we did for 10 years before the Revolutionary War, the Bill of Particulars, the Committees of Correspondence, is we take all those issues, all those points, and we bring it to the people, and we lay them all together end-to-end, not just looking at one issue here, one issue there, and we show people how the government is working for a bunch of international bankers and following their interests and not ours.
[02:13:33.067 --> 02:13:38.810]  And so we've done the job now to a great extent of waking people up to a certain extent.
[02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:46.714]  Now we've got to inform them even further and then teach them how to say no and take over the government peacefully through political processes.
[02:13:47.014 --> 02:13:52.776]  The globalists have seen this coming, so they're boldly putting in CIA-controlled fraudulent voting machines.
[02:13:53.577 --> 02:13:54.257]  Hard to believe?
[02:13:54.297 --> 02:13:55.578]  The evidence is legion.
[02:13:56.438 --> 02:13:58.479]  It's totally documented, just like 9-11.
[02:13:58.539 --> 02:13:59.880]  We've got to be able to admit that.
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:01.941]  And then I put forward a plan
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:15.024]  As I put forward a plan to get cities and states out of the Patriot Act, I've done the same thing with this, and I've given everybody a plan.
[02:14:15.044 --> 02:14:15.944]  Again, it wasn't hard.
[02:14:15.984 --> 02:14:16.845]  I'm not a genius.
[02:14:18.065 --> 02:14:24.027]  You have a petition recall ballot to recall a law in every county, city, and state.
[02:14:24.127 --> 02:14:26.048]  You push for it federally, but don't focus there.
[02:14:26.068 --> 02:14:26.968]  That's the hardest place.
[02:14:27.248 --> 02:14:28.849]  Hit them where they're weak first, locally.
[02:14:30.358 --> 02:14:35.241]  The vast majority of people in polls are against these new electronic no record fraud machines.
[02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:37.022]  You have the petitions.
[02:14:37.082 --> 02:14:39.083]  You get more signatures than you need.
[02:14:39.464 --> 02:14:42.186]  You go in to have a ballot initiative put on.
[02:14:43.466 --> 02:14:45.568]  The ballot initiative funds itself.
[02:14:47.089 --> 02:15:06.221]  That's built into it, to then pay and to designate a citizen's board with massive oversight, who then administers an election to withdraw the electronic voting machines and go back to paper verified ballots.
[02:15:06.582 --> 02:15:07.702]  And then it doesn't end there.
[02:15:07.802 --> 02:15:09.424]  Then you've got to be involved in that.
[02:15:10.304 --> 02:15:14.247]  It's a step by step by step by step process.
[02:15:17.572 --> 02:15:21.654]  All of that is so sophisticated and hard to do until we have massive numbers that are awake.
[02:15:22.075 --> 02:15:26.017]  People are awake on this issue or that issue, but not on the wide spectrum.
[02:15:26.337 --> 02:15:34.242]  So I'm here doing what I do best, doing what I know bears the most fruit per bombing run in the Info War.
[02:15:34.602 --> 02:15:36.123]  I am just laying down as much lead
[02:15:37.183 --> 02:16:02.548]  Downstream, at the enemy, and forgetting what flies at me, not even looking at what they say about me, what they do to me, my life, none of it matters, 110%, thrown against the machinery, hitting every issue I can, giving attention to the good people fighting the New World Order from every spectrum I can, putting out as many articles as I can, making as many films as I can, trying to give the people hope as much as I can with the facts, and moving forward against these people.
[02:16:04.284 --> 02:16:08.666]  So, to just say, well, we're all against this stuff, but they still do it, so it's depressing!
[02:16:09.226 --> 02:16:09.566]  No!
[02:16:10.007 --> 02:16:16.489]  Now we force them to behave in a dictatorial, thug-like, tyrannical, despotic manner!
[02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:19.871]  Authoritarian manner!
[02:16:20.131 --> 02:16:22.532]  Now, we're going to demonstrate that!
[02:16:24.433 --> 02:16:29.615]  And we're going to take their number one tool of government-sponsored terror, that they carry out over and over again,
[02:16:30.985 --> 02:16:35.890]  Which they use to then scare us back into our slave pens over and over again.
[02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:39.294]  We expose that and break their main program!
[02:16:40.902 --> 02:16:43.084]  And then, if you really want freedom, you know what else is going to happen?
[02:16:43.104 --> 02:16:45.506]  They're going to hit us with bio-attacks, nukes, everything.
[02:16:45.766 --> 02:16:46.927]  We've got to know what happens.
[02:16:47.067 --> 02:16:50.290]  Police, military, generals, they're already going public.
[02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:52.972]  When it gets that bad, they're going to start getting on our side.
[02:16:52.992 --> 02:16:56.375]  Some of them will be thugs who want to be king rats in different regions.
[02:16:56.695 --> 02:16:58.336]  Things will probably totally break down.
[02:16:58.436 --> 02:16:59.757]  It's going to be hard, folks.
[02:17:00.118 --> 02:17:01.178]  It's going to be bad.
[02:17:01.659 --> 02:17:02.760]  It's going to be serious.
[02:17:04.815 --> 02:17:14.621]  The globalists know their minions are rebelling, that's why they're going to an automated military, automated tanks, automated combat mechs, automated planes, automated bombing systems, automated drones.
[02:17:14.881 --> 02:17:19.543]  The globalists are racing to get an automated control grid in, because they know they're going to lose control.
[02:17:19.723 --> 02:17:21.885]  You go, well that's scary, we better just go along with them.
[02:17:22.265 --> 02:17:22.725]  Uh-uh!
[02:17:23.145 --> 02:17:30.870]  Because they're going to build a control grid that's almost complete, that's going to be put in place, so they can orderly kill us, 85-95% the official plan.
[02:17:35.894 --> 02:17:39.478]  By the way, Hillary's out today saying that the government wants to put microchips in our brains.
[02:17:40.279 --> 02:17:41.241]  Or corporations do.

[02:20:45.817 --> 02:20:53.100]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:56.321]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[02:20:56.441 --> 02:20:59.802]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[02:21:00.243 --> 02:21:09.106]  Grown by Nature products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with co-factors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[02:21:09.606 --> 02:21:10.126]  We're good to go.
[02:21:29.497 --> 02:21:29.977]  I think so.
[02:21:50.524 --> 02:21:52.445]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:21:52.906 --> 02:21:55.728]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.028 --> 02:21:58.410]  Lauren, Mike, Stefan, we're going to get to you.
[02:21:58.430 --> 02:21:59.430]  And I'm going to take a lot of calls.
[02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:02.172]  I said to answer that question earlier, it was so important.
[02:22:02.673 --> 02:22:05.275]  But right now, Larry in Arizona says he disagrees.
[02:22:05.695 --> 02:22:06.916]  So he goes to the head of the line.
[02:22:06.956 --> 02:22:07.896]  Larry, what's on your mind?
[02:22:07.916 --> 02:22:09.257]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:09.357 --> 02:22:11.279]  This is a real disagreement call.
[02:22:11.319 --> 02:22:13.280]  I'm not jumping the line like some other people do.
[02:22:14.181 --> 02:22:16.623]  I've called about this before and we had a short talk about it.
[02:22:16.683 --> 02:22:18.384]  Unfortunately, I was hoping it would be a little longer.
[02:22:19.344 --> 02:22:23.226]  And if you stand with the Muslims, I disagree with it.
[02:22:26.148 --> 02:22:26.448]  Hello?
[02:22:26.568 --> 02:22:31.531]  I stand with people being able to have sovereign nations that are not enslaved by the New World Order.
[02:22:32.912 --> 02:22:36.014]  Okay, Alex, you gave some good reasons why the Iranians should hate us.
[02:22:36.954 --> 02:22:38.615]  Now, what about in Sudan?
[02:22:38.655 --> 02:22:41.117]  Why are the Muslims attacking the Christians in Sudan?
[02:22:42.276 --> 02:22:42.476]  Right, and
[02:22:58.274 --> 02:23:10.842]  Let's not bring the United States into this, because we all know, we all disagree, we all agree about the United States being... Well, before Mohammed showed up 1400 years ago, there were slavers up there going down and grabbing blacks and selling them to the Romans.
[02:23:11.242 --> 02:23:17.807]  So it's just, again, it's just different labels on the same groups of people doing the exact same thing.
[02:23:18.627 --> 02:23:27.633]  Right, but it's not just there, it's all over the world Muslims are attacking other people, they attack the Hindus in India, they attack
[02:23:28.563 --> 02:23:30.203]  The Buddhists in Sri Lanka.
[02:23:31.324 --> 02:23:37.345]  You know, the Bible says that it's going to be a wild ass of a man and they're going to attack all of their neighbors and it's proven to be true.
[02:23:39.106 --> 02:23:42.346]  So Iran's attacking their neighbors, Syria's attacking their neighbors.
[02:23:42.706 --> 02:23:43.547]  I mean, I love your argument.
[02:23:44.007 --> 02:23:45.087]  So we should kill all the Arabs?
[02:23:45.107 --> 02:23:45.667]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:23:46.307 --> 02:23:47.308]  That's not what I'm saying, Alex.
[02:23:47.428 --> 02:23:50.308]  I'm just saying, you're saying let's look at things from an Iranian's perspective.
[02:23:50.348 --> 02:23:53.529]  I'm saying, let's look at things from an Israeli's perspective.
[02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:57.390]  So Iran's in Sudan enslaving blacks.
[02:23:57.490 --> 02:23:57.630]  Okay.
[02:23:58.522 --> 02:23:59.622]  No, that's not what I'm saying.
[02:23:59.662 --> 02:24:00.662]  Well, that is what you said.
[02:24:00.883 --> 02:24:01.983]  That is what you said.
[02:24:02.323 --> 02:24:10.585]  Okay, our government, I mean, Pat Robertson owns gold mines with African dictators who are supposedly Christian, where they have slaves they execute.
[02:24:10.845 --> 02:24:12.105]  Listen, thanks for the call, man.
[02:24:12.625 --> 02:24:15.086]  You know, I'm not here defending Muslims.
[02:24:15.826 --> 02:24:16.226]  Okay?
[02:24:16.526 --> 02:24:20.167]  But I'm telling you, most of your stereotypes and most of the examples are a bunch of baloney.
[02:24:20.927 --> 02:24:21.667]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:24:22.147 --> 02:24:25.348]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lorraine in Tennessee.
[02:24:25.388 --> 02:24:26.128]  Lorraine, go ahead.
[02:24:26.897 --> 02:24:49.695]  Hello, I've been a regular listener to your show and speaking of speaking out, last year I went to the Skull and Bones site of Yale University and I think if I speak for myself, I went through the side gate and there was a door next to it and I actually myself saw a display for the skulls and
[02:24:50.979 --> 02:24:53.862]  Now in the back, I'm surprised that gate was open.
[02:24:53.882 --> 02:25:00.908]  There is a big fountain with a grim reaper and satanic skulls eating people and that's been on national TV.
[02:25:00.988 --> 02:25:02.489]  You personally saw that?
[02:25:04.031 --> 02:25:07.634]  I went through the side door and I think I was very close to it.
[02:25:07.654 --> 02:25:08.815]  I think I know what you're talking about.
[02:25:09.876 --> 02:25:11.437]  By side door, you're saying side gate.
[02:25:11.457 --> 02:25:13.839]  You're saying you were in the back courtyard.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:15.741]  Yeah, that's all the back courtyard.
[02:25:16.281 --> 02:25:18.103]  So you just, why were you in Connecticut?
[02:25:19.057 --> 02:25:21.818]  Um, I was there in a summer youth program on Yale's campus.
[02:25:22.279 --> 02:25:26.200]  Oh, so you were there for college and, uh, describe what you saw.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:38.406]  Um, what happened was that, um, I also knocked on the door and I waited out there for an hour and there was this Asian man, I think he was a bonesman, and I opened the door and I saw the whole wall of all their photo albums.
[02:25:39.383 --> 02:25:44.447]  So I know they do have a record of like every year and they have a registry similar to what the author recounted.
[02:25:44.607 --> 02:25:45.428]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:25:45.468 --> 02:25:49.751]  You went through a side gate in the back that was open and then you opened a tomb door.
[02:25:49.771 --> 02:25:50.311]  It was open?
[02:25:51.012 --> 02:25:55.415]  No, I knocked on the door and somebody answered but... Oh, when he opened it you could see in the background.
[02:25:55.435 --> 02:25:55.976]  What did you see?
[02:25:56.076 --> 02:26:00.159]  Yeah, in the background I saw a poster of something.
[02:26:00.179 --> 02:26:00.719]  I'm not sure what it was.
[02:26:00.739 --> 02:26:01.540]  It might have been a skull.
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:05.363]  I think it was a skull canvas and
[02:26:06.155 --> 02:26:10.097]  I'm sure I saw a big wall of photo albums from... Wait a minute.
[02:26:10.117 --> 02:26:11.617]  You saw a big painting of a skull?
[02:26:12.258 --> 02:26:12.898]  I think so.
[02:26:14.159 --> 02:26:14.979]  Well, that's Christian.
[02:26:15.199 --> 02:26:17.480]  Yeah, I can barely see it back.
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.922]  I'm sure I saw this big wall of all their photo albums from every year.
[02:26:21.942 --> 02:26:22.702]  You know what you ought to do?
[02:26:22.722 --> 02:26:25.904]  You ought to write me up a five paragraph little article and tell us about yourself.
[02:26:25.924 --> 02:26:27.124]  You ought to email it to me.
[02:26:27.444 --> 02:26:28.025]  I'd post it.
[02:26:28.045 --> 02:26:28.785]  That's really interesting.
[02:26:29.125 --> 02:26:31.366]  What did he say to you when he came out?
[02:26:32.407 --> 02:26:34.047]  Oh, he's like, what are you here for?
[02:26:35.848 --> 02:26:36.808]  Do you know somebody here?
[02:26:36.828 --> 02:26:37.608]  I'm like, no.
[02:26:37.628 --> 02:26:48.250]  He's like, you know, he just started flirting with me and then eventually he just slammed the door and he realized I wasn't associated with them because I think somebody else was looking for somebody.
[02:26:48.611 --> 02:26:49.391]  What are you good looking?
[02:26:50.951 --> 02:26:51.831]  Well, I don't know.
[02:26:54.132 --> 02:27:02.013]  But, um, yeah, later that day I was waiting outside the door and I saw somebody come in and later I saw him come out and he was surprised to see me.
[02:27:03.173 --> 02:27:04.874]  And he's like, what are you doing here?
[02:27:05.034 --> 02:27:05.454]  And I'm like,
[02:27:06.024 --> 02:27:06.744]  Why did you join?
[02:27:06.764 --> 02:27:07.985]  He just ran off.
[02:27:08.285 --> 02:27:10.166]  I can tell there are no people watching him.
[02:27:10.186 --> 02:27:14.468]  Oh yeah, when they're getting tapped, they wear hoods over their heads when they go in.
[02:27:15.209 --> 02:27:16.469]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:27:16.770 --> 02:27:18.991]  Why don't you write up a description of that and send it to us?
[02:27:19.411 --> 02:27:19.731]  Okay.
[02:27:21.052 --> 02:27:21.712]  How old are you?
[02:27:22.512 --> 02:27:22.873]  I'm 18.
[02:27:23.733 --> 02:27:25.394]  18, so you were there while you were still in high school?
[02:27:26.034 --> 02:27:26.374]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:26.655 --> 02:27:27.555]  Just having a visit.
[02:27:27.895 --> 02:27:29.576]  Well, it's good to have you on board as a listener.
[02:27:29.596 --> 02:27:30.477]  I really appreciate it.
[02:27:30.897 --> 02:27:32.858]  Alright, we'll be right back and take more calls.
[02:27:32.898 --> 02:27:34.759]  I'm Alex Jones, JonesReport.com.
[02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:39.224]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.165 --> 02:27:42.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.552 --> 02:27:53.894]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.294 --> 02:27:58.995]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:59.295 --> 02:28:06.897]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[02:28:07.277 --> 02:28:14.139]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:14.379 --> 02:28:15.739]  There are no side effects!
[02:28:16.079 --> 02:28:19.701]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:20.001 --> 02:28:27.065]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:27.365 --> 02:28:30.387]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:30.787 --> 02:28:34.089]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[02:28:34.149 --> 02:28:34.509]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:34.549 --> 02:28:35.389]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:45.658 --> 02:28:48.679]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.999 --> 02:28:53.922]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.162 --> 02:28:58.523]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.824 --> 02:29:07.727]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.947 --> 02:29:11.569]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.849 --> 02:29:16.895]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.175 --> 02:29:23.903]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.404 --> 02:29:24.945]  What about you?
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:31.042]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:29:31.102 --> 02:29:32.182]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.596 --> 02:29:47.417]  Come on, Bill.
[02:29:47.637 --> 02:29:49.478]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[02:29:49.658 --> 02:29:52.819]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:29:53.139 --> 02:29:53.720]  What did you do?
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:54.640]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:55.461]  No, John.
[02:29:55.541 --> 02:29:56.721]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:57.001 --> 02:30:02.524]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:02.804 --> 02:30:09.067]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:09.387 --> 02:30:11.608]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:11.868 --> 02:30:13.189]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:15.990]  Whoa!
[02:30:16.350 --> 02:30:17.551]  What was that website again?
[02:30:17.631 --> 02:30:21.112]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:22.512]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:22.652 --> 02:30:26.973]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:27.113 --> 02:30:27.693]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:27.973 --> 02:30:29.174]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:29.574 --> 02:30:30.254]  Check, please.
[02:30:32.034 --> 02:30:33.475]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:30:33.955 --> 02:30:34.535]  Sure, John.
[02:30:34.775 --> 02:30:39.136]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:39.436 --> 02:30:41.117]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:30:41.277 --> 02:30:41.537]  Deal.
[02:31:02.221 --> 02:31:06.762]  Larry in Arizona, you know, brings up a legitimate point.
[02:31:08.342 --> 02:31:14.604]  There are sects of Muslims that run around killing and enslaving their neighbors and they fight with each other.
[02:31:15.299 --> 02:31:19.002]  But in most cases, when you look at this, it's old, ancient tribal warfare.
[02:31:19.482 --> 02:31:30.031]  In the case of the Sudan and other areas of Africa, they've been killing those same tribes, enslaving each other, selling each other from the time before there were Muslims.
[02:31:32.412 --> 02:31:36.316]  And, you know, DynCorp is involved in white slavery kidnapping.
[02:31:36.336 --> 02:31:38.457]  That doesn't mean all American corporations are.
[02:31:39.718 --> 02:31:40.959]  It's the same thing with the Muslims.
[02:31:41.980 --> 02:31:44.402]  I mean, Turkey's big into white slavery.
[02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:45.830]  See, that's what I do.
[02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:46.791]  I expose everybody.
[02:31:47.751 --> 02:31:49.333]  Turkey, our big ally, of course.
[02:31:49.413 --> 02:31:50.674]  Saudi Arabia is even worse.
[02:31:51.234 --> 02:31:54.617]  It's always our allies, the people we leave alone that are really the bad ones.
[02:31:55.698 --> 02:32:02.183]  They kidnap Russian and Ukrainian and other women and they, up to like 15 men a day, raping them.
[02:32:03.024 --> 02:32:04.265]  I mean, imagine it.
[02:32:06.506 --> 02:32:09.208]  But the Arabs aren't big on blowing little kids' heads off.
[02:32:09.289 --> 02:32:11.190]  That's mainly the Russians and the Israelis.
[02:32:12.271 --> 02:32:13.112]  It's been a national
[02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:31.617]  Italian television, what, four years ago, they did a big national piece on it, and it was, they reported on it, and in one particular snuff film that they got, it was, what, a two-year-old toddler, and these demon creatures, I mean, words can't even really describe it.
[02:32:32.838 --> 02:32:35.659]  These demon creatures rape the child and blow his head off.
[02:32:37.039 --> 02:32:39.440]  And it was being sold into the U.S.
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:41.321]  through some different Israeli companies.
[02:32:42.142 --> 02:32:46.206]  And folks, that is foreign, mainstream, national Italian television.
[02:32:47.748 --> 02:32:50.070]  So the Arabs are kidnapping white women.
[02:32:50.210 --> 02:32:51.251]  They go for a premium.
[02:32:52.112 --> 02:33:01.601]  Blond-haired, blue-eyed women, you know, they might get $400,000 for one because they can whore her out for 5-10 years and get her addicted to dope and have her be a drug pusher on the street or just kill her.
[02:33:01.621 --> 02:33:04.144]  And they force them to have all these abortions.
[02:33:04.544 --> 02:33:05.045]  It's horrible.
[02:33:07.083 --> 02:33:10.805]  Now the Saudis are big buyers of the snuff films.
[02:33:10.825 --> 02:33:11.766]  They're not big promoters.
[02:33:12.226 --> 02:33:14.427]  So there actually are some Arabs who are into it.
[02:33:14.948 --> 02:33:17.329]  The thousands of Saudi princes, some of them are into it.
[02:33:18.189 --> 02:33:21.371]  But Israel's the big producer of snuff films.
[02:33:23.973 --> 02:33:24.593]  I'm not kidding.
[02:33:24.633 --> 02:33:27.255]  You can Google that and you can find mainstream news articles about it.
[02:33:27.655 --> 02:33:32.058]  They're the biggest importer of a bunch of different synthetic drugs to this country.
[02:33:34.199 --> 02:33:36.281]  And it's really bad.
[02:33:37.202 --> 02:33:38.384]  Malaysia's big into it.
[02:33:38.424 --> 02:33:41.947]  There are a bunch of Arab countries that are into the... but mainly that's women.
[02:33:42.948 --> 02:33:43.649]  Of age women.
[02:33:45.231 --> 02:33:46.512]  And it's all just terrible.
[02:33:46.592 --> 02:33:50.296]  So, you know, by that yardstick should we invade Israel?
[02:33:50.897 --> 02:33:54.180]  Because they've got some of the biggest slave brothels in the world?
[02:33:56.463 --> 02:33:56.703]  Yeah!
[02:33:58.516 --> 02:34:00.357]  I think we should go ahead and invade Mexico.
[02:34:00.397 --> 02:34:09.420]  They've militarily said they're taking over the Southwest and told their people to come take over and are, by all intents and purposes, attacking this country.
[02:34:09.981 --> 02:34:19.144]  So we have more of a reason to invade and take over Mexico City and put a real government in there, you know, for and by the people, than we do to be in Iraq.
[02:34:19.284 --> 02:34:26.347]  I'm not saying we should invade Mexico, but I'm saying we have more of a reason to go in there than we do Iraq.
[02:34:27.728 --> 02:34:37.012]  So yeah, you can use your sedan example, where they fly over and bomb the Christians, and where they kill them if they don't convert, and where they enslave them.
[02:34:39.113 --> 02:34:40.753]  And you bet they're Muslims, and they're doing it.
[02:34:40.993 --> 02:34:45.055]  And it's shameful, and it has been decried by some of the Muslim nations.
[02:34:45.115 --> 02:34:46.296]  It should be decried by others.
[02:34:46.816 --> 02:34:48.256]  And shame on Muslims that don't.
[02:34:49.837 --> 02:34:53.359]  Governments themselves are inherently evil.
[02:34:54.299 --> 02:34:56.700]  Elites get away with more and more.
[02:34:58.004 --> 02:35:06.234]  Even if one elite isn't that corrupt, they still have centralized power, then their kids or the next elite that comes in is even worse.
[02:35:06.714 --> 02:35:07.816]  It always gets worse.
[02:35:08.697 --> 02:35:15.525]  It's ever, you know, entropy, it's always going downwards, spiraling down, breaking down, falling apart.
[02:35:21.198 --> 02:35:21.838]  You know, that's the thing.
[02:35:21.878 --> 02:35:23.099]  Again, the Muslims are going to kill us.
[02:35:23.119 --> 02:35:23.799]  They want to kill us.
[02:35:23.819 --> 02:35:24.459]  They're going to get us.
[02:35:24.479 --> 02:35:25.080]  They're going to get us.
[02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:25.720]  They're going to get us.
[02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:34.524]  They're not bare with hundreds of thousands of Americans contracting and dying of AIDS and Hepatitis C from knowing that the stuff was in the blood.
[02:35:35.464 --> 02:35:36.205]  The blood products.
[02:35:37.025 --> 02:35:37.905]  One example of hundreds.
[02:35:37.925 --> 02:35:45.689]  You understand, our elite openly has written books and publications about plans to build compact police state cities so they can orderly kill you.
[02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:47.950]  That's what Dr. Pianka at UT.
[02:35:47.970 --> 02:35:48.790]  Go read his speech.
[02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:50.611]  A transcript has been released.
[02:35:53.092 --> 02:35:54.153]  95% standing ovation.
[02:35:55.334 --> 02:35:59.496]  He said, we need a police state like China to carry out these population reduction programs.
[02:35:59.836 --> 02:36:01.497]  Okay, do you understand?
[02:36:01.838 --> 02:36:20.269]  The people that run America, that run England, that run Europe, openly say they're going to take your private property, your children are going to grow up and live in dorms, they're going to be forced drugged, they're going to euthanize you when you get old and, you know, cost people too much money.
[02:36:21.147 --> 02:36:27.352]  It is a hell system with social workers involved in your daily lives from cradle to grave.
[02:36:29.233 --> 02:36:31.495]  With everyone forcibly implanted with chips.
[02:36:31.555 --> 02:36:34.637]  At first it's going to be, oh, you get an insurance discount if you have it.
[02:36:34.657 --> 02:36:36.078]  And then, oh, it's too expensive if you don't.
[02:36:36.398 --> 02:36:37.079]  That's already starting.
[02:36:37.099 --> 02:36:38.420]  Blue Cross Blue Shield.
[02:36:39.921 --> 02:36:40.781]  AP, yesterday.
[02:36:41.282 --> 02:36:43.583]  And it was in one of their tech publications.
[02:36:49.002 --> 02:36:50.063]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[02:36:50.083 --> 02:36:53.224]  They can point at a billion, two people.
[02:36:53.664 --> 02:36:54.665]  One billion, two hundred million people.
[02:36:54.685 --> 02:36:59.327]  They can find a few really evil Muslim countries and point out crimes they're committing and say, they want to get us!
[02:36:59.727 --> 02:37:00.827]  See, they're going to kill us!
[02:37:01.968 --> 02:37:15.414]  Then I can prove our government, at the end of World War II, went and radicalized the Muslims, went and put the radical Mullahs into control, went and tried to, quote, have them as a counterbalance against, um, the, quote, uh, Communists.
[02:37:15.434 --> 02:37:17.075]  But it turns out our government was funding that too.
[02:37:17.893 --> 02:37:23.195]  And they build up these boogeymen, and if you want to be stupid, and not... Look, look, I got the facts, okay?
[02:37:23.435 --> 02:37:24.735]  I got the facts, Jack!
[02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:26.736]  And it's not arrogance when I say that.
[02:37:26.796 --> 02:37:31.297]  I've done the research, I've posted it for you, it's admitted, this is all I do!
[02:37:34.658 --> 02:37:35.038]  Alright?
[02:37:37.319 --> 02:37:41.460]  And, and... I'm just sick of it.
[02:37:43.381 --> 02:37:44.281]  I'm just sick of it.
[02:37:46.202 --> 02:37:47.002]  I'm tired of it.
[02:37:49.426 --> 02:37:53.728]  The country I love is going to hell in a handbasket right in front of my eyes.
[02:37:55.168 --> 02:37:57.409]  They are building a hellish slave grid.
[02:37:57.689 --> 02:38:00.290]  The entire country is being turned into a prison.
[02:38:02.191 --> 02:38:16.677]  I heard some do-gooder radio talk show host this morning talking about how more Texas towns are making anybody that goes off school at lunch, or anybody who's in PE, or anybody who plays football, or anybody who's in bands, or anybody who gets to go on field trips
[02:38:17.384 --> 02:38:19.745]  Now they're trying to, by the way, make it where just everybody has to do it.
[02:38:20.085 --> 02:38:26.328]  You all get urine tests for drugs because we've got to stop the cocaine and the heroin and the methamphetamine.
[02:38:27.008 --> 02:38:29.449]  Well, two of those are controlled and shipped in by our government.
[02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:31.891]  They hate the other because they don't control it.
[02:38:33.711 --> 02:38:40.014]  So just any time I hear people were calling in going, well, the Fourth Amendment, well, the Fifth Amendment, well, you know, innocent until proven guilty.
[02:38:40.314 --> 02:38:44.596]  Well, I know that sounds good, but we've got to do this to save our kids.
[02:38:44.696 --> 02:38:46.057]  Just shut up!
[02:38:47.643 --> 02:38:48.964]  I don't want to hear it, okay?
[02:38:49.084 --> 02:38:51.126]  I don't like drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:51.786 --> 02:38:54.729]  I might take an aspirin once a month, a Tylenol once a month.
[02:38:55.189 --> 02:38:56.730]  I drink one cup of coffee a day.
[02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:59.473]  Occasionally drink a glass of wine or beer.
[02:39:00.193 --> 02:39:01.554]  Shouldn't even do that, makes me fat.
[02:39:01.935 --> 02:39:05.698]  But I'm not into your stinking drugs, okay?
[02:39:06.378 --> 02:39:08.560]  And the drug culture makes me sick, too.
[02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:13.364]  You're not rebellious, you're not cool, you're helping the New World Order, you're using their filthy products.
[02:39:14.082 --> 02:39:18.706]  But when some cop pulls me over and wants to search my car, I want to vomit all over him.
[02:39:19.127 --> 02:39:20.308]  Oh, this is for your own good.
[02:39:20.348 --> 02:39:21.048]  What do you have to hide?
[02:39:21.068 --> 02:39:22.189]  It's to keep America safe.
[02:39:22.570 --> 02:39:23.551]  Baloney!
[02:39:24.031 --> 02:39:25.152]  Our borders are open.
[02:39:25.392 --> 02:39:27.054]  The American Union's being shut up.
[02:39:27.314 --> 02:39:29.256]  The country's being flushed down the commode.
[02:39:30.517 --> 02:39:37.904]  There's cameras everywhere and you're sitting here wanting to search my car to look for a product that was shipped in by your bosses.
[02:39:37.944 --> 02:39:39.265]  You make me sick.
[02:39:41.773 --> 02:39:44.314]  And you want to, again, everything's a prison.
[02:39:44.374 --> 02:40:01.063]  Fences around the schools, ID barcodes, thumb scanning to get school lunches, police dogs in there, random frisks, random locker searches, kids being arrested for writing English essays, talking about their dad who's a Marine Corps captain who has an M-16, the word M-16, you're arrested.
[02:40:04.105 --> 02:40:09.588]  You got Dixie plastic knives in your carcass, you're moving out, you're a senior Valedictorian, you're arrested.
[02:40:09.969 --> 02:40:25.498]  I mean, it's a, it's a quote, zero-tolerance police state hellhole, arresting people in hotel bars, you fly in at 8 o'clock at night, have three beers watching a baseball game, and they come right into the Austin Hotel, and the cops arrest people for being drunk, for having three Miller Lights.
[02:40:25.798 --> 02:40:27.359]  That ain't freedom, you scum!
[02:40:29.551 --> 02:40:33.958]  Stop telling me the government cares about me and is going to help me and is going to do something good for me!
[02:40:34.138 --> 02:40:41.589]  You work for a pack of drug dealing, child kidnapping, child murdering, child molesting scum!
[02:40:44.293 --> 02:40:46.434]  Look in the mirror, admit you're idiots!
[02:40:46.514 --> 02:40:58.602]  I'm talking to the people in this country who believe in the establishment, that don't know Bush is anti-gun, that don't know that Clinton's worked for the CIA, that don't know it's all staged WWF theater!
[02:40:58.842 --> 02:40:59.382]  Listen to me!
[02:40:59.462 --> 02:41:01.023]  I'm trying to save you!
[02:41:01.303 --> 02:41:02.924]  I'm trying to get you to save me!
[02:41:03.124 --> 02:41:04.305]  We're in this together!
[02:41:06.386 --> 02:41:09.848]  Believe me, it's so bad I can't even articulate how bad it is!
[02:41:10.068 --> 02:41:10.789]  You idiots!
[02:41:11.912 --> 02:41:21.177]  You think the government loves you, and you gotta take all our rights because you're a thin blue line, and if you don't stick together and violate our rights, why, you'll all be overwhelmed by us?
[02:41:21.597 --> 02:41:22.358]  You idiots!
[02:41:22.578 --> 02:41:26.840]  You give your children vaccines with cancer viruses in it, filled with mercury!
[02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:28.241]  I didn't do that to you!
[02:41:28.481 --> 02:41:30.062]  You did it, you stupid idiot!
[02:41:33.146 --> 02:41:54.681]  I mean, there's nothing dumber than people when... Look, the government's lied to us over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
[02:41:55.558 --> 02:42:04.804]  I got official UT papers and official award-winning World War II official history books about the Germans putting stannous and sodium fluoride in the water as a toxic sedative!
[02:42:05.004 --> 02:42:06.825]  That's why I know it's bad in the water!
[02:42:06.965 --> 02:42:08.166]  You, you idiots!
[02:42:11.668 --> 02:42:12.809]  I mean, I'm serious!
[02:42:15.651 --> 02:42:17.072]  I didn't make this stuff up!
[02:42:17.292 --> 02:42:20.134]  I can't believe how horrible it is!
[02:42:20.314 --> 02:42:21.034]  Believe me!
[02:42:22.795 --> 02:42:23.836]  But I know it's true!
[02:42:26.047 --> 02:42:35.673]  So you go ahead and look at politics like it's the cowboys versus the redskins and you pick your side and you feel good about it.
[02:42:35.974 --> 02:42:38.415]  You just go ahead and do whatever you want.
[02:42:39.156 --> 02:42:41.157]  Just let them take your pension funds.
[02:42:41.217 --> 02:42:42.398]  Let them devalue the dollar.
[02:42:42.758 --> 02:42:44.019]  Let them make you go bankrupt.
[02:42:44.059 --> 02:42:47.421]  Let them get rid of the 20% of industry we got left, what we did have.
[02:42:47.782 --> 02:42:49.102]  Let them just do it all.
[02:42:49.122 --> 02:42:49.603]  And you know what?
[02:42:49.643 --> 02:42:55.807]  You're so stupid, you're going to love it going smiling right into the euthanasia facilities.
[02:42:57.108 --> 02:42:58.529]  Right out of Soylent Green.
[02:42:59.210 --> 02:43:00.691]  I mean, it's like Soylent Green, folks.
[02:43:00.751 --> 02:43:05.054]  I'm laying here on the gurney and I'm saying, SOYLENT GREEN IS MADE OUT OF PEOPLE!
[02:43:05.174 --> 02:43:06.555]  YOU GOTTA TELL THEM, HATCHER!
[02:43:06.655 --> 02:43:07.496]  YOU GOTTA GO!
[02:43:07.576 --> 02:43:08.537]  YOU GOTTA WARN THEM!
[02:43:08.677 --> 02:43:13.941]  I mean, how am I supposed to behave when Peter Singer and Bianca and Ted Turner and...
[02:43:14.821 --> 02:43:18.983]  Henry Kissinger and Prince Philip and Prince Charles and all of them!
[02:43:19.043 --> 02:43:23.785]  It's just all they talk about is how they're gonna put in a police state and then start killing us!
[02:43:24.085 --> 02:43:28.728]  And I'm reading the richest and most powerful people in the world saying it!
[02:43:28.868 --> 02:43:33.230]  And then we catch them doing it over and over again in a thousand different ways!
[02:43:33.430 --> 02:43:36.531]  And you sit here and you trust them and you believe them!
[02:43:39.933 --> 02:43:41.133]  This is how I really feel!
[02:43:41.173 --> 02:43:42.394]  This is who I really am!
[02:43:45.291 --> 02:43:47.052]  I feel so sorry for you people.
[02:43:47.572 --> 02:43:50.613]  I listen to you and it's painful to know you're stupid slaves.
[02:43:51.093 --> 02:43:55.054]  To know you'll probably, some of you, never figure it out when I actually love you!
[02:43:58.395 --> 02:44:02.016]  You're poor, pitiful, dumbed down morons.
[02:44:05.517 --> 02:44:07.537]  And you don't know enough to save yourselves.
[02:44:07.917 --> 02:44:13.759]  Some of you, deep in your guts right now, the hair standing from the back of your neck because you're designed to know truth when you hear it.
[02:44:14.375 --> 02:44:17.577]  If you haven't had it totally driven from you, you know what I'm saying is the truth.
[02:44:17.717 --> 02:44:18.778]  But don't believe your gut.
[02:44:18.798 --> 02:44:19.638]  Don't believe your instinct.
[02:44:19.799 --> 02:44:21.620]  Don't believe the marrow of your bones.
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:23.381]  Don't believe the pit of your stomach.
[02:44:23.561 --> 02:44:25.602]  You go research what I'm saying.
[02:44:26.963 --> 02:44:29.165]  I'd love to just cram the truth down your throat.
[02:44:29.345 --> 02:44:31.586]  I wish you'd go look at my claims.
[02:44:32.907 --> 02:44:34.248]  I wish you'd go check it out.
[02:44:37.014 --> 02:44:41.237]  Our country is dying right now with the American Union alone!
[02:44:41.578 --> 02:44:44.020]  And the illegal aliens are a big part of that.
[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:45.381]  They're a part of that program.
[02:44:48.263 --> 02:44:52.766]  But you've been conditioned to parrot the stupid subjects the mainstream media talks about.
[02:44:53.367 --> 02:44:56.969]  OJ, Michael Jackson, Lacey Peterson, Aruba Girl.
[02:45:02.874 --> 02:45:05.196]  So, look, I said I'd take calls.
[02:45:05.856 --> 02:45:06.677]  Who's up next here?
[02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:10.840]  Michael in Texas, go ahead.
[02:45:11.221 --> 02:45:13.121]  Wow, that's a tough act to follow, Alex.
[02:45:13.181 --> 02:45:13.902]  I'll try to do good.
[02:45:16.903 --> 02:45:18.543]  You know, I got some comments for your caller.
[02:45:18.563 --> 02:45:21.204]  It's the guy who's worried, the Batman comic book guy.
[02:45:21.564 --> 02:45:26.066]  You know, a year ago, only a small, small percentage of the population knew what was going on.
[02:45:26.566 --> 02:45:27.806]  And we're making progress every day.
[02:45:27.826 --> 02:45:34.829]  We got Steven Jones, and we got all these people, you know, raising their hands, saying, oh, something's up, something's wrong.
[02:45:35.547 --> 02:45:39.048]  Exactly, and I'm tired of hearing, oh, everybody's waking up, but we're impotent!
[02:45:39.288 --> 02:45:41.248]  We can't do nothing!
[02:45:42.529 --> 02:45:44.369]  Nothing ever got done like that!
[02:45:44.869 --> 02:45:48.490]  If you're going to be a defeatist, you know, I maybe don't even want to know you.
[02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:50.051]  I don't know.
[02:45:51.331 --> 02:45:54.512]  And then I got a comment for this Larry guy in Arizona.
[02:45:55.392 --> 02:46:01.634]  You know, Ayatollah Khomeini had pretty much completely disarmed before a U.S.-backed Saddam invaded him.
[02:46:02.074 --> 02:46:03.034]  So the only reason
[02:46:03.658 --> 02:46:10.639]  Iran has a military in the first place is because we gave them a reason to have a military because we invaded them because they didn't have a military.
[02:46:11.579 --> 02:46:15.980]  So, and he's talking about this country that's invading its neighbors.
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:22.221]  I don't know if he's reading the book of revelations or what, but I mean that sounds like Israel to me, not Muslims.
[02:46:22.821 --> 02:46:23.422]  Call me crazy.
[02:46:24.822 --> 02:46:26.202]  You can't tell these people that.
[02:46:27.762 --> 02:46:29.483]  Alright, and then I had a question for you.
[02:46:29.503 --> 02:46:29.883]  You know,
[02:46:32.654 --> 02:46:46.496]  It sort of occurred to me, they're talking about weapons of mass destruction again on TV and it sort of occurred to me that maybe the IDF is going to use WMD on themselves for justification for further action in the region and I was wondering
[02:46:47.099 --> 02:46:50.000]  What your opinion is on how realistic that is?
[02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:51.261]  I don't know.
[02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:57.904]  I have AP, UPI, Haratz and a bunch of other mainstream news articles where Israel admits they staged most terror attacks against themselves.
[02:46:58.184 --> 02:47:00.525]  And again, you can prove that to a newsman.
[02:47:00.545 --> 02:47:02.826]  I can be at a radio station and go, here's a mainstream article.
[02:47:02.866 --> 02:47:06.587]  Yeah, well, they got to do that to get tough or to get support.
[02:47:06.607 --> 02:47:10.089]  And I'm like, you'll believe anything they say when they've admittedly done this.
[02:47:10.129 --> 02:47:10.489]  Yeah.
[02:47:10.969 --> 02:47:11.309]  Yeah.
[02:47:11.369 --> 02:47:11.649]  Yeah.
[02:47:11.669 --> 02:47:13.410]  Well, we'll see.
[02:47:13.430 --> 02:47:15.531]  I mean, I really think they might use
[02:47:16.004 --> 02:47:20.086]  The WMD against themselves to justify further action, but we'll see what happens.
[02:47:20.227 --> 02:47:26.010]  Yeah, no, this is all shaping up for that, and the FBI's saying, ooh, Hamas and Hezbollah's about to hit America!
[02:47:26.050 --> 02:47:32.334]  Yeah, and what did your reporter over there, he said that this was shaping up before even the guy was kidnapped.
[02:47:33.034 --> 02:47:36.156]  Oh yeah, the troops were already massing, everything was staged.
[02:47:36.216 --> 02:47:41.379]  So it seems to me like they're defusing this as an excuse, and then they're going to use the WMD on themselves for further action.
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:43.000]  But anyways,
[02:47:43.883 --> 02:47:45.464]  Alex, I've got a documentary coming out.
[02:47:45.724 --> 02:47:49.266]  It won't be out for a while, but I hope you check it out when it does come out.
[02:47:50.086 --> 02:47:50.786]  Send me a copy!
[02:47:51.087 --> 02:47:51.767]  Alright, I will do.
[02:47:52.407 --> 02:47:53.188]  Thanks a lot, Bubba.
[02:47:54.028 --> 02:47:58.790]  We'll come back and talk to Stefan and Chris and a few others in the final segment.
[02:47:58.810 --> 02:47:59.811]  I said I'd take a bunch of calls.
[02:47:59.851 --> 02:48:03.713]  I'm getting better about it, but... I just... I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:48:04.553 --> 02:48:06.354]  I mean, how many times have we been lied to?
[02:48:06.414 --> 02:48:07.855]  How many times have they been caught
[02:48:09.566 --> 02:48:14.907]  Doing horrible things, the atomic soldiers, taking little kids in this country, tens of thousands and radiating them.
[02:48:16.447 --> 02:48:18.268]  I mean, they just take little kids and fry them.
[02:48:18.308 --> 02:48:21.568]  You know, just take trips, put them in a chamber, nerve gas them.
[02:48:23.288 --> 02:48:26.329]  But I trust our government.
[02:48:26.969 --> 02:48:29.069]  I like our government.
[02:48:29.490 --> 02:48:32.910]  Well, our founding father said, don't trust the government.
[02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:37.431]  It's just... I mean, at this point, come on.
[02:48:38.968 --> 02:48:40.710]  As obvious as the nose on your face.
[02:48:40.730 --> 02:48:52.400]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.741 --> 02:48:54.662]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.063 --> 02:49:02.690]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.393 --> 02:49:10.438]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.838 --> 02:49:22.266]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.586 --> 02:49:26.509]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.529 --> 02:49:28.470]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.810 --> 02:49:32.633]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.593 --> 02:49:49.594]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.934 --> 02:49:58.757]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:59.077 --> 02:50:03.759]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:04.239 --> 02:50:10.945]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.346 --> 02:50:23.116]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.596 --> 02:50:28.059]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:28.239 --> 02:50:30.701]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:30.721 --> 02:50:32.542]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:32.562 --> 02:50:33.763]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.823 --> 02:50:35.303]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:35.323 --> 02:50:36.364]  Now get available in Iowa.
[02:50:47.125 --> 02:50:47.405]  I think so.
[02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:03.129]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.006 --> 02:51:35.090]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:41.119]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:57.100 --> 02:52:02.942]  Just a program note, American Perspectives, supposedly next Saturday the 29th of July, 8 p.m.
[02:52:03.022 --> 02:52:10.104]  Eastern, on C-SPAN 1, will air our 9-11 Neocon agenda panel discussion.
[02:52:11.185 --> 02:52:14.146]  Or they said maybe the next Saturday, August 5th.
[02:52:14.946 --> 02:52:16.146]  I don't know what to believe, folks.
[02:52:16.206 --> 02:52:22.088]  Call into their C-SPAN journal Saturday and Sunday and Monday morning and say, hey, is that true?
[02:52:22.108 --> 02:52:23.028]  When is that scheduled?
[02:52:23.709 --> 02:52:24.869]  Keep hammering them on it.
[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:26.821]  Because I don't believe them now.
[02:52:26.861 --> 02:52:27.902]  It's taking way too long.
[02:52:28.982 --> 02:52:29.663]  It may be true.
[02:52:29.943 --> 02:52:30.724]  We'll see what happens.
[02:52:30.804 --> 02:52:37.309]  Also, I'll be doing a new Sunday show that we're going to syndicate on KLBJ, owned by Amos Communications, from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:37.349 --> 02:52:37.669]  Central.
[02:52:37.689 --> 02:52:40.171]  You can listen on the internet at Infowars.com.
[02:52:40.191 --> 02:52:44.994]  Not on the regular button you click, but down there you'll see the KLBJ logo, call signal.
[02:52:45.274 --> 02:52:46.555]  You can click on that and listen.
[02:52:47.916 --> 02:52:51.079]  We'll take it for a test drive, see how many streams they can send out.
[02:52:51.879 --> 02:52:53.621]  Maybe overload it, then they can beef it up.
[02:52:53.641 --> 02:52:53.981]  Who knows?
[02:52:55.241 --> 02:52:56.863]  Oh, man, I got really mad earlier.
[02:52:56.923 --> 02:53:00.046]  I just... It's just... To be under threat like this!
[02:53:00.246 --> 02:53:01.267]  Stated threat!
[02:53:01.867 --> 02:53:04.530]  And then they know we're so ignorant we're not even reading their own documents.
[02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:07.933]  It just... That's what causes me anxiety, is to not fight these people.
[02:53:08.414 --> 02:53:09.995]  Stéphane in Canada, welcome!
[02:53:12.457 --> 02:53:15.640]  First, I just want to say sorry because I'm not English.
[02:53:16.021 --> 02:53:17.222]  I don't really speak English.
[02:53:18.002 --> 02:53:19.684]  I'm from Quebec, Canada.
[02:53:21.430 --> 02:53:28.155]  This morning on television, they were showing a guy on Radio-Canada the French version of CBC.
[02:53:28.996 --> 02:53:41.485]  He was saying that the people in Lebanon, Iran and Syria were the ones that did the 9-1-1 World Trade Center and the attack on England and Spain.
[02:53:48.607 --> 02:53:52.048]  So now they're claiming that Lebanon and Iran carried out 9-11.
[02:53:52.068 --> 02:53:53.949]  Well, they already blamed it on Iraq, too.
[02:53:53.989 --> 02:53:54.989]  Maybe they'll blame it on everybody.
[02:53:55.749 --> 02:54:00.631]  And also in the newspapers, they don't talk about Iraq now.
[02:54:01.951 --> 02:54:06.353]  And our Prime Minister just said that he fully supports Israel.
[02:54:07.733 --> 02:54:16.896]  And that he just spent about $30 billion on warships and airplanes and tanks and other military stuff.
[02:54:19.554 --> 02:54:22.095]  That's your new Bilderberg Group Prime Minister.
[02:54:26.356 --> 02:54:27.096]  Anything else, sir?
[02:54:27.856 --> 02:54:39.779]  Yes, when he came in power almost a year ago, he also said that now the media couldn't go to the Parliament to ask a politician a question.
[02:54:40.079 --> 02:54:44.660]  That's right, they've locked out the media, they're putting all these media gag orders on big cases.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:46.521]  Canada's becoming a police state.
[02:54:47.907 --> 02:54:54.071]  And also now they are trying to get people out of Lebanon.
[02:54:54.131 --> 02:54:56.812]  We have about 40,000 people there.
[02:54:57.853 --> 02:55:06.518]  And here they are making a big crisis because they did not ship to get people out and they are trying to leave people there.
[02:55:06.958 --> 02:55:07.499]  I hear you.
[02:55:07.779 --> 02:55:08.999]  Good to have you joining us.
[02:55:09.039 --> 02:55:09.740]  Call back again.
[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:10.460]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:12.481]  Chris, where are you calling from?
[02:55:12.542 --> 02:55:13.062]  Last caller.
[02:55:13.922 --> 02:55:14.243]  Boston.
[02:55:14.663 --> 02:55:14.963]  Welcome.
[02:55:15.666 --> 02:55:16.286]  Welcome.
[02:55:16.426 --> 02:55:18.627]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:55:19.108 --> 02:55:24.150]  I just want to say you're an American treasure, just like Jefferson and all the other guys.
[02:55:24.170 --> 02:55:27.932]  I want to say, united we stand, divided we fall.
[02:55:28.272 --> 02:55:35.635]  The devil's path is hate and prejudice, which puts hell on earth, and God's path is love, truth, and understanding, which will put heaven on earth.
[02:55:38.336 --> 02:55:40.597]  Let's see.
[02:55:41.318 --> 02:55:41.778]  You still there?
[02:55:42.038 --> 02:55:42.218]  Yes.
[02:55:43.315 --> 02:55:48.356]  I just want to say, like, I didn't believe in God, but I started to believe in God a few years ago, and I didn't believe in the devil.
[02:55:48.436 --> 02:55:51.957]  But a few years ago, I felt the devil's breath on my neck.
[02:55:52.077 --> 02:55:55.178]  And I do believe in the devil, but the God is stronger.
[02:55:55.878 --> 02:55:57.558]  Love, love can conquer anything.
[02:55:58.118 --> 02:55:59.938]  Well, bravo to that, my friend.
[02:55:59.998 --> 02:56:00.919]  Good to hear from you.
[02:56:01.379 --> 02:56:02.019]  Amen to that.
[02:56:02.639 --> 02:56:05.540]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, rebroadcast throughout the weekend.
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:09.880]  At InfoWars.com, we take everyday show and just loop it continually.
[02:56:10.201 --> 02:56:12.101]  We have an internet stream up there for you, yes.
[02:56:13.258 --> 02:56:14.959]  Now that I plug it, I'll have to beef it up.
[02:56:16.259 --> 02:56:17.980]  Alright, get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:18.060 --> 02:56:19.140]  Get my new film, Terror Storm.
[02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:22.041]  Make a bunch of copies and expose these murdering scumbags.
[02:56:22.081 --> 02:56:22.961]  We're gonna take them down.
[02:56:23.001 --> 02:56:23.881]  God bless you all!
[02:56:25.802 --> 02:56:30.703]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
