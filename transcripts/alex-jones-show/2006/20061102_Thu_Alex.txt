[00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.131]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:07.854]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:09.658]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:12.683]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:17.406]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:21.709]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:41.113]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.654]  It is Thursday, the second day of November 2006.
[00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:59.681]  We're now five days away from the off-year 2006 congressional elections and many gubernatorial elections across the country as the neocons move, as usual, to engage in election fraud coast-to-coast.
[00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:05.423]  And it's already streaming in around the nation with people trying to use electronic voting machines in early voting.
[00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:11.638]  That they are flipping the votes right here in San Antonio and in Austin, Texas, right in front of everyone's eyes.
[00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:13.881]  We'll be getting into that later in the program.
[00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:22.730]  Ralph Steadman, a legendary, I guess, cartoonist, artist and many political statements as well, will be joining us to talk about
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.426]  His new book, and what's happening with the neo-fascists here in the United States, that will be in the second hour.
[00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:39.474]  Then we have Episcopal priest, Frank Morales, long-time anti-New World Order activist, and a good friend of mine, will be joining us from New York.
[00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:51.544]  His lovely wife wrote the breakthrough cover story article a few months ago for Vanity Fair that basically sent loose change out of the atmosphere into orbit.
[00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:53.659]  The positive report.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.441]  Just a great crew.
[00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.443]  He'll be joining us.
[00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:58.825]  Just a little factoid there.
[00:01:58.845 --> 00:01:59.726]  I don't know why I mentioned it.
[00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:00.967]  But she's really nice.
[00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.549]  Got a chance to meet her in New York on 9-11.
[00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.653]  Got a chance to go to his church for a big meeting.
[00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:09.896]  But to make a long story short, he's joining us in the third hour.
[00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:12.439]  So Ralph Steadman coming up.
[00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.001]  British cartoonist and
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:43.466]  character terrorist will be joining us in the second hour good friends with Hunter S Thompson and a lot of other legends and we'll be picking his brain about a bunch of different issues including you know does he think that does he think that his friend Hunter S Thompson committed suicide we know Hunter S Thompson was working on reports about bombs in the buildings we know Hunter S Thompson was working on reports about the pedophile rings in DC when he got his head blown off so we'll be talking to Ralph Steadman
[00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:46.249]  Coming up in the next hour.
[00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.452]  I'm not going to belabor this much on the broadcast, but it's very exciting, and I want to thank all of you out there.
[00:02:53.232 --> 00:02:59.776]  Terror Storm was released on Amazon two and a half days ago, and it started out at about 7,000 on the charts.
[00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:07.620]  It is now, well, it hit 51 on the top, and that's not in some genre, not political, not documentary.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.002]  No, no, no, it hit 51 this morning when I saw it.
[00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:22.801]  I think it's sunk back to 57 right now, on DVD period, on the total DVD charts, film charts, on Amazon.com.
[00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:37.524]  You can get the film for $11.19 at Amazon.com, and I'm asking you, the listeners, to go to Amazon.com, even if you've already got the film, and to buy 4 or 5 copies, or however many you can afford.
[00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:39.825]  You can buy, I guess, 9 copies for like $100.
[00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.685]  And give them as gifts.
[00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:47.214]  I mean, at this low of a price, you really can't beat it.
[00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.058]  I've talked to the distributor.
[00:03:50.458 --> 00:04:01.323]  When something gets into the top 10 of Amazon, it tends to stay in the top 10 for weeks, and it'll be exponential, the amount of people there doing their shopping, they're doing their video buying.
[00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:11.788]  It's just incredible that it's been in the top 100 since yesterday afternoon, and has risen to 51, now settling back to 57.
[00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:14.029]  I checked it about 10 minutes ago.
[00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:20.605]  Please go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:26.047]  You can link right through there on the sites to Amazon to the particular subpage where they're selling it.
[00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:27.428]  I'm going to give you an example.
[00:04:27.548 --> 00:04:29.528]  Superman's like 80-something.
[00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:32.930]  Talladega Nights is like 90-something.
[00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.251]  I mean, big movies that just got released.
[00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:46.313]  And buyers and other sub-distributors and chains, look at the Amazon rankings to decide what they're going to carry, what they're going to do.
[00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.396]  This is a great opportunity to give the New World Order a black eye.
[00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:51.798]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten TerrorStorm.
[00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:57.022]  If you haven't, please, immediately, go to Amazon.com and get TerrorStorm.
[00:04:57.222 --> 00:04:59.504]  We'll be right back with all the news, your calls, and tons of info.
[00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.639]  It's here!
[00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:09.640]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.682]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.342 --> 00:05:25.403]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.804 --> 00:05:32.645]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:37.218]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:41.038]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:43.439]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.680]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.521]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:02.783]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:06:03.143 --> 00:06:04.644]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:05.304]  What?
[00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:06.044]  Again?
[00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.085]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:12.587]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:14.108]  Why did you do that?
[00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:20.111]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:21.431]  Are we there yet?
[00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:22.612]  for the entire trip.
[00:06:22.852 --> 00:06:25.013]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:26.514]  Great idea!
[00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:29.455]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:32.236]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:36.819]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:37.419]  Honey!
[00:06:38.243 --> 00:06:39.484]  You're terrific!
[00:06:39.884 --> 00:06:41.364]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.886]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:45.947]  Now can we stop?
[00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:47.187]  I need to go, too.
[00:06:47.487 --> 00:06:51.929]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.462]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.784]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:17.153]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:19.795]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:54.795]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:34.956]  Not only did they pass the Military Commissions Act on October 17th, the Defense Authorization Act, or the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, totally removed posse comitatus, the 1878 law, barring the military from engaging in law enforcement actions against the American people,
[00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:39.265]  And it took control of the governorships.
[00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:45.128]  We are, and folks, I've been saying we're creeping towards it, that we were already into it to the first stages.
[00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:50.351]  We are now officially in the grip of a dictatorship.
[00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:54.353]  Now, let's see if they try to use the power they claim they have.
[00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:56.134]  Let's see if they now try to implement.
[00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:02.597]  You know, it's one thing to walk into a bank and point guns at people and try to load your bags full of cash.
[00:09:03.077 --> 00:09:04.678]  It's another thing to get out of the bank
[00:09:05.407 --> 00:09:14.532]  And to get out of the city and to get to your getaway without the police blowing your tires out and running you off the road and dealing with you.
[00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:16.293]  And we are the police.
[00:09:16.413 --> 00:09:19.675]  We are the real defenders of the republic.
[00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:23.477]  We are the white blood cells trying to save the country from a grave infection.
[00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:25.538]  The country is in shock.
[00:09:25.658 --> 00:09:27.219]  It is dying right now.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.601]  North American Union openly announced, openly set up.
[00:09:31.722 --> 00:09:34.063]  Endless wars now being prosecuted.
[00:09:35.111 --> 00:09:36.492]  Police being militarized?
[00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:38.774]  I mean, we're living history.
[00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:52.364]  We're living something that's never happened in this country since the Civil War, and the powers that Bush has declared are frankly greater in scope than what Abraham Lincoln even did.
[00:09:55.306 --> 00:10:04.073]  We have a nation that has been hijacked by a criminal cabal, and that's why they carried out 9-11.
[00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:12.830]  They carried out the attacks to set up a police state, to use the attacks as an excuse to put the control grid in.
[00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:16.792]  And now the control grid is in place.
[00:10:16.852 --> 00:10:27.338]  The face scanning cameras, the license plate scanning cameras, the armored vehicles, the microwave guns, the sound cannons are deployed in every major city and federal warehouses, state police warehouses.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.461]  We're here.
[00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:33.742]  We're here right now.
[00:10:35.377 --> 00:10:38.360]  And the enemy will now move forward.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.981]  They have not stopped.
[00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:43.845]  Every part of their plan they have announced they would implement, they have done.
[00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:51.331]  And you have to ask yourself, what will be the trigger for them to actually lower the guillotine?
[00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:52.512]  You know, our neck is in it.
[00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:54.314]  We're tied up in the stocks.
[00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.216]  Will they kick the lever?
[00:10:57.977 --> 00:10:59.158]  Will they pull the cord?
[00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:00.940]  Will they drop the guillotine?
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.261]  The question is, will we struggle?
[00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:06.228]  And remove ourselves from the guillotine's grasp.
[00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:08.429]  We're here.
[00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:10.729]  We're here.
[00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.511]  And that's really all there is to it.
[00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:18.192]  I'd like to get your take on what's happening.
[00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:18.672]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:18.692 --> 00:11:18.772]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:21.233]  Ralph Steadman, legendary cartoonist and caricaturist, will be joining us.
[00:11:21.253 --> 00:11:24.094]  And then of course, what I'm really looking forward to
[00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:31.524]  He is Frank Morales.
[00:11:31.544 --> 00:11:33.125]  I've been on with him several times in the past.
[00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:42.511]  Really an expert on the police state, an Episcopal priest, and a good friend of mine, a great political mind, who didn't drop the ball like I did two weeks ago.
[00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.332]  Two weeks ago, I learned of the Defense Authorization Act.
[00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:49.215]  I read the subsections for total martial law, and I've been so ready for it.
[00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:50.956]  I've been watching the preparations.
[00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:52.397]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:53.638]  I've read the federal documents.
[00:11:53.738 --> 00:11:55.539]  I've seen NORTHCOM's announcements.
[00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:06.695]  And we have told you we were going into this, but I, for some reason, just, uh, I guess subconsciously I'm sick of it all and didn't really cover it properly.
[00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:07.475]  Well, we are now.
[00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:12.557]  Better late than never, right?
[00:12:15.699 --> 00:12:16.599]  I love this country.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.744]  But I'll tell you what I really love is my family that lives here and my ancestors that lived here and fought here and died here.
[00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:31.349]  And I'm not going to let these criminals do this to our country.
[00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:55.926]  I know you're not going to let these criminals, isn't a strong enough word, these megalomaniacal control freaks, these people whose hearts burn with white-hot desire for total control, I'm not going to stand idly by while my nation is dismembered before my eyes and fully captured as a warmock, a
[00:12:57.506 --> 00:13:03.968]  Engine, a juggernaut, a battering ram, a titan of wickedness.
[00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:06.889]  Not in my name, not in your name.
[00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:10.990]  We're at a crossroads.
[00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.591]  The enemy has now set up official total dictatorship.
[00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:18.653]  The state governors have been publicly announced to be nothing but vassals.
[00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:24.394]  The documents, the legislation passed, signed by the president, same day passed HR 6166.
[00:13:26.744 --> 00:13:29.446]  By the way, we were wondering why Bush didn't sign it for two and a half weeks.
[00:13:29.966 --> 00:13:34.890]  It was because the defense spending package hadn't been completed yet.
[00:13:37.172 --> 00:13:39.293]  And so he signed both of those together.
[00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:44.077]  And we read in the last few days sections of it.
[00:13:44.097 --> 00:13:45.238]  We'll do that again in the third hour.
[00:13:45.778 --> 00:13:50.361]  It clearly states the president is a dictator.
[00:13:51.322 --> 00:13:51.642]  Clearly.
[00:13:52.843 --> 00:13:55.045]  It clearly states there are no more states.
[00:13:55.882 --> 00:14:05.544]  But you see, they needed to do that, not just for a police state, but to have that executive unhindered, unbridled authority to merge us into the North American Union.
[00:14:06.144 --> 00:14:10.866]  And I keep hearing people get on the air and go, oh look, they want it by 2010, they want it by 2007.
[00:14:12.826 --> 00:14:18.267]  We've had Robert Gellin Ross on, former NSA, international oil company, executive and consultant.
[00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:20.988]  And I don't just go off what Robert says.
[00:14:22.648 --> 00:14:33.817]  And he had the documents, and we even made a film about it with C-Span Clips with David Rockefeller admitting it back in 2001, that they would have their American Union by 2005 by hook or by crook.
[00:14:34.678 --> 00:14:50.250]  And Bush in March, and then in December expanded it and signed it, and the government, the North American Union government is meeting, and business owners from Texas to California have been given their new North American Union ID tax numbers, and it's now been in major newspapers, and Lou Dobbs has talked about it,
[00:14:51.147 --> 00:15:00.051]  And so it's like saying, because you haven't seen the whole two-hour movie, that you're not at the movies when you're thirty minutes into it.
[00:15:00.971 --> 00:15:08.234]  Kind of a weird analogy, but people keep saying, it's like saying you're not in the ocean just because you're up to your neck and you haven't swum out a hundred yards.
[00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:15.156]  So everyone's running around saying, oh my gosh, it's almost here, they're announcing, and oh my gosh, we're almost in the North American Union.
[00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:15.517]  No.
[00:15:16.337 --> 00:15:19.018]  They, through executive authority, which is
[00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:22.575]  A fraud.
[00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:26.918]  The President does not have a unitary executive power.
[00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:27.799]  He is not a dictator.
[00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:29.921]  He may declare those powers, but they're fraudulent.
[00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:34.905]  He has strict limitations, enumerated.
[00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:37.267]  But they've done it!
[00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:38.708]  They have done it!
[00:15:38.768 --> 00:15:41.650]  My goodness, they have done it!
[00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.332]  I mean, we are in a dictatorship.
[00:15:45.313 --> 00:15:47.355]  We are in an official dictatorship.
[00:15:47.975 --> 00:15:50.878]  Again, that is not some embellishment or a flourish.
[00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:57.660]  That is what all the constitutional scholars and experts across the political spectrum say.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:09.867]  Even the Bush White House has been saying for five plus years that the President has the power of a German Fuhrer, of a Roman Emperor.
[00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:18.632]  He has just totally set himself up and now they will attempt to move forward with it.
[00:16:20.115 --> 00:16:27.869]  And he has ordered the bureaucracy, he has ordered the federal agencies to finish the absorption of the state agencies.
[00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:30.875]  That is 90 plus percent complete.
[00:16:32.677 --> 00:16:48.365]  The Pentagon has told MIT Magazine, and it's been in several other publications in the last two years, that the cameras and the microphones and the scanning systems are a Pentagon designed to control an occupied country.
[00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:50.506]  I mean, the military does not mince words.
[00:16:52.487 --> 00:16:56.468]  Within days of President Bush signing H.R.
[00:16:56.488 --> 00:16:59.650]  6166, this is how Frank Morales and others discovered it,
[00:17:01.747 --> 00:17:05.508]  Northcom announced that they are now in operational control of the U.S.
[00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:14.712]  as a military theater for the first time since Reconstruction and the Civil War that was before it.
[00:17:17.273 --> 00:17:24.816]  And they announced in one of three articles in the Army Times that Mexican and Canadian troops will be used in the U.S.
[00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:27.657]  to quell disturbances, conspiracies,
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.683]  Everything that's in the Military Commissions Act, it says disturbances, conspiracies, rebellions.
[00:17:33.563 --> 00:17:35.544]  The government is openly talking about rebellions.
[00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:41.428]  What are they planning that they believe will elicit a rebellion?
[00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:52.235]  Well, the former chief economist of the World Bank, number two at the World Bank, Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, told you last Friday, I'm going to re-air that interview tomorrow, we've had so many requests in the third hour,
[00:17:53.414 --> 00:17:58.617]  That we are going into a worldwide depression if things are not properly managed.
[00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.398]  And I said, is it being properly managed?
[00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:01.898]  And he said, absolutely not.
[00:18:02.699 --> 00:18:07.942]  And the numbers I've seen by other experts in the Financial Times of London and other publications that are very accurate.
[00:18:09.983 --> 00:18:13.544]  Of course, they're elitist and they try to spin it, but I said 12 to 24 months.
[00:18:13.565 --> 00:18:14.165]  He said, yes, 12 to 24 months.
[00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:14.425]  We're here.
[00:18:20.214 --> 00:18:22.376]  So will the crisis be an economic implosion?
[00:18:22.496 --> 00:18:25.958]  Will the crisis be a thermonuclear, atomic, or radiation attack?
[00:18:26.598 --> 00:18:27.959]  Will it be a biological attack?
[00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:37.486]  Will it be a string of bombings and mass shootings conducted by elements of the military-industrial complex and their allied private mercenary armies?
[00:18:38.807 --> 00:18:40.448]  We are captured, my friends.
[00:18:40.508 --> 00:18:42.409]  We are going into global receivership.
[00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:49.194]  Again, Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist, World Bank, Nobel Prize winner, on this broadcast said, I said,
[00:18:49.807 --> 00:18:57.396]  Clearly, is the IMF World Bank banking cartel structure now subdividing and looting western countries?
[00:18:57.776 --> 00:18:59.799]  He said, yes, it has moved into that phase.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.602]  They have devoured the third world.
[00:19:02.662 --> 00:19:09.550]  They have laid ruin and salted the economic soils of those countries' systems.
[00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.813]  The globalization is designed to wreck any independence, any sovereignty.
[00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:19.917]  It is designed to wreck middle classes that are not dependent on government or corporate control.
[00:19:20.377 --> 00:19:30.405]  It is designed to cause an artificial consolidation of wealth into a tiny fraction of the population's hands.
[00:19:32.746 --> 00:19:33.727]  We are here.
[00:19:34.688 --> 00:19:39.111]  We have now entered the outer rings of this
[00:19:39.927 --> 00:19:41.648]  World Government Black Hole.
[00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:48.372]  We are accelerating through its gravitational pull towards its epicenter.
[00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:53.075]  We're going in, through, and beyond!
[00:20:04.442 --> 00:20:06.383]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:06.883 --> 00:20:09.265]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:18.497]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:19.457 --> 00:20:24.359]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:24.999 --> 00:20:34.983]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:35.463 --> 00:20:37.724]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:38.553 --> 00:20:39.734]  For more information call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:39.754 --> 00:20:39.794]  702-953-0267.

[00:20:41.334 --> 00:20:42.255]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:21:01.341 --> 00:21:03.802]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.282 --> 00:21:11.425]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:16.907]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office?
[00:21:17.127 --> 00:21:25.430]  We continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.792]  The handwriting is on the wall.
[00:21:27.812 --> 00:21:36.502]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:39.246]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:21:46.715 --> 00:21:47.836]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6.
[00:21:51.117 --> 00:21:51.777]  Call now.
[00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:58.420]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.062 --> 00:22:04.363]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:05.724]  The real money folks.
[00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:10.926]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:22:11.447 --> 00:22:12.327]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:14.932 --> 00:22:16.813]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:22:17.353 --> 00:22:19.714]  A 5% increase.
[00:22:20.254 --> 00:22:26.176]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:22:26.296 --> 00:22:29.517]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:30.278 --> 00:22:32.619]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[00:22:32.639 --> 00:22:35.900]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.541]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:42.022]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar,
[00:22:42.537 --> 00:22:47.080]  Call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.461]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:22:51.142 --> 00:22:54.063]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:55.924]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.782 --> 00:23:06.905]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:23:07.145 --> 00:23:08.887]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:15.452]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:23:15.752 --> 00:23:21.877]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:23:22.117 --> 00:23:28.142]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:23:28.422 --> 00:23:34.826]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:23:34.986 --> 00:23:38.508]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:23:38.828 --> 00:23:42.531]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:45.252]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:46.433]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:23:46.653 --> 00:23:49.794]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:49.814 --> 00:23:51.475]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:25.447]  Okay, so we're now in an official dictatorship.
[00:24:25.527 --> 00:24:27.208]  Posse Comitatus has been abolished.
[00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:28.528]  The governors have been abolished.
[00:24:29.649 --> 00:24:33.630]  Everything's going under federal control, which itself is owned by big private banks publicly.
[00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.932]  They're pushing us towards a worldwide depression by design to consolidate everything.
[00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:51.594]  The general public's whizzing beer and stumbling around watching football has no idea what we're talking about, but there is a giant mass of people worldwide that are waking up, and we're headed towards a head-on collision with the New World Order.
[00:24:52.538 --> 00:25:01.404]  Coming up in the next hour, Ralph Steadman, again, famous cartoonist and character terrorist, friends with Hunter S. Thompson and others, will be joining us in the transmission.
[00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:09.190]  And then we've got Frank Morales coming up to talk about the Defense Authorization Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, which I just
[00:25:13.388 --> 00:25:14.449]  Is as bad.
[00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:17.231]  It's like having the Elzebub and Satan next to each other.
[00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:18.112]  It's the same entity.
[00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:21.215]  You can't really say one's worse or one's not as bad.
[00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:25.878]  It's two wings on the same bird of carrion.
[00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:27.720]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.042]  Right now, let's just go to your calls.
[00:25:30.182 --> 00:25:32.203]  I'll run through some of the other news.
[00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:37.988]  Joe in Wisconsin, I'm told, disagrees with me, so he'll go to the head of the line.
[00:25:38.348 --> 00:25:38.969]  Go ahead, Joe.
[00:25:39.525 --> 00:25:42.127]  Well, I don't necessarily disagree with you, but rather the format.
[00:25:42.147 --> 00:25:43.528]  That's what you told the guy that answered the phone.
[00:25:43.568 --> 00:25:44.569]  Well, the format.
[00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:45.950]  That's what I asked him about.
[00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:51.735]  But I'm just going to ask if the Supreme Court and the Congress can have an opening word of prayer.
[00:25:52.296 --> 00:25:57.720]  Shouldn't we... I mean, we're looking at something too big for us to handle.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.123]  We already know the elections are going to be stolen, or they're going to try.
[00:26:01.784 --> 00:26:06.828]  And we've got stuff we are staring down the barrel of that will just eat us for breakfast.
[00:26:07.737 --> 00:26:17.183]  And I think God Himself puts us in those spots, so that we have to realize it and say, you know, we need to ask Him to help us take care of this.
[00:26:17.564 --> 00:26:23.588]  And I'm sorry, I'm guilty of it myself, because I kept saying... Well, what I ought to do is read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:26:23.668 --> 00:26:26.650]  I mean, they pray to God in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:33.834]  Yeah, so I was going to ask if you could have an opening word of prayer and a closing one, because I think... Well, let me just say this, sir.
[00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:36.376]  This is a news broadcast.
[00:26:37.131 --> 00:26:54.727]  Okay, so there's a place for news broadcasts, there's a place for preachers on the radio, and I have pastors that I respect here on the broadcast routinely, like Pastor Butch and others, and I've got a pastor coming up in the third hour, Frank Morales, but let me be clear here on this issue.
[00:26:54.747 --> 00:26:56.589]  We've had me a pastor a few weeks ago in studio.
[00:26:58.369 --> 00:27:10.187]  Number one, most of the churches in this country are bought and paid for by the federal government, so maybe I'll say a prayer every day that the people's eyes be open to the fact that their churches are under federal control.
[00:27:11.202 --> 00:27:15.067]  Because the average listener will hear me sing a prayer at the start of each show and won't even understand it.
[00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:27.762]  I mean, Christianity has been so warped now, and that's what the devil does, he counterfeits to where people are running away from Christianity because they think Christianity is Bush and gay porn stars at sex parties.
[00:27:28.643 --> 00:27:31.724]  And open borders and Karl Rove laughing at everyone.
[00:27:31.764 --> 00:27:35.025]  They expropriate that.
[00:27:35.105 --> 00:27:37.765]  Bush prays on his national radio address all the time.
[00:27:38.686 --> 00:27:41.946]  So my point is, is just praying like Christ said.
[00:27:42.007 --> 00:27:44.007]  You see these Pharisees out praying in public.
[00:27:44.247 --> 00:27:45.467]  You need to pray in your closet.
[00:27:45.527 --> 00:27:46.808]  And believe me, I do pray.
[00:27:46.828 --> 00:27:48.148]  And I pray hard.
[00:27:48.548 --> 00:27:50.309]  But I'm not big on these public prayers.
[00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:51.649]  And I'm not saying public prayers are bad.
[00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.411]  And I don't hide my light under a bushel either.
[00:27:55.491 --> 00:27:57.152]  I'm very proud of my faith.
[00:27:57.492 --> 00:27:59.593]  But at the same time, I don't know if you get what I'm saying, sir?
[00:28:00.413 --> 00:28:03.315]  Well, I think we're at the point where we are the prodigal son.
[00:28:03.355 --> 00:28:12.098]  We just woke up to the fact that, hey, you know, this pig slop, you know, it's taking care of the pigs better than, you know, we're being taken care of.
[00:28:12.378 --> 00:28:16.640]  And I think we've brought this whole mess on ourselves.
[00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.023]  I don't even know so much.
[00:28:19.123 --> 00:28:24.186]  I want to pray for people to wake up, and for good people to be protected, and for others to see the light.
[00:28:24.486 --> 00:28:28.748]  But in a way, let all this horrible stuff come, because all these yuppies and people deserve it.
[00:28:29.568 --> 00:28:36.352]  Well, there is also trusting in your own strength, which I think people, and I'm guilty of it too, enjoy.
[00:28:36.472 --> 00:28:38.973]  Well, I, for a minute, trusted my strength.
[00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:44.456]  I am a soft thing of flesh that's transitory, that's only here for the twinkling of an eye.
[00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:46.097]  I am incredibly weak.
[00:28:47.439 --> 00:28:49.641]  My flesh is weak, but my soul is strong.
[00:28:50.662 --> 00:29:00.288]  Well, if you want, I can send you some passages about trusting in someone who is much stronger than our opposition.
[00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:02.970]  Well, that's why my soul is strong.
[00:29:03.731 --> 00:29:06.893]  Well, I mean, I could write it up and have it posted somewhere.
[00:29:07.253 --> 00:29:08.954]  Okay, well listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:29:11.261 --> 00:29:16.704]  We're on the battlefield, we're in a war, and God just wants us to have courage.
[00:29:18.005 --> 00:29:22.867]  God wants us to stop the talk and get out there.
[00:29:27.189 --> 00:29:28.550]  I'll be doing my praying tonight.
[00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:30.731]  I appreciate you though.
[00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:33.412]  You're welcome to call in and say a prayer if you'd like.
[00:29:34.593 --> 00:29:36.354]  You have a problem with the format.
[00:29:36.454 --> 00:29:39.175]  I'm going to watch from on the wall, folks.
[00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:40.196]  I'm trying to warn the people.
[00:29:41.187 --> 00:29:42.568]  I'm up here on the wall.
[00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:43.648]  I'm not going to hit a knee.
[00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.969]  All right.
[00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.989]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:46.389]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.512 --> 00:29:52.432]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.892 --> 00:29:54.513]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:58.215]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:07.319]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.421]  We're good.
[00:30:32.563 --> 00:30:32.863]  We're good.

[00:31:57.843 --> 00:31:59.705]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:07.812]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:32:08.232 --> 00:32:12.997]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:32:13.377 --> 00:32:15.999]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.843]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:32:20.658 --> 00:32:24.981]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:28.604]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:32:29.225 --> 00:32:32.067]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:32:32.842 --> 00:32:34.623]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:32:34.643 --> 00:32:37.085]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:32:37.105 --> 00:32:37.145]  U.S.
[00:32:37.465 --> 00:32:39.206]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:39.507]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:32:39.527 --> 00:32:40.427]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:32:40.467 --> 00:32:41.088]  Ask for George.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:38.988]  He's tryin' to find me I'm standin' in the middle of life with my pants behind me I got a smile for everyone I meet Long as you don't tire of beggin' my bae For droppin' a bomb on my street Now come on baby I'm catchin' the road
[00:33:50.114 --> 00:33:52.135]  Welcome back, continuing with Open Phones.
[00:33:52.935 --> 00:33:54.635]  Ralph Stebbins joining us in the next hour.
[00:33:55.176 --> 00:33:57.056]  Pastor Frank Morales in the third.
[00:33:58.057 --> 00:33:58.957]  Really a great man.
[00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:01.098]  I really respect him.
[00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:06.619]  You know, with people, you get around them in person, you can just feel their strength and how good they are.
[00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:08.580]  Plus, you see their works, the things they've done.
[00:34:09.804 --> 00:34:17.167]  Sir, I wasn't trying to be persnickety with you, the first caller, Joe, telling me I should pray on the air at the start of each broadcast.
[00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:20.768]  That's just not how I do things.
[00:34:21.548 --> 00:34:24.229]  I mean, I pray when I feel led to pray.
[00:34:24.269 --> 00:34:25.190]  And I pray every day.
[00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.031]  I don't even like talking about my private, personal matters.
[00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:31.612]  And I really can feel a connection to God.
[00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:33.013]  I can feel the Spirit.
[00:34:33.953 --> 00:34:35.233]  And it's very private.
[00:34:35.313 --> 00:34:36.674]  It's very intense.
[00:34:37.638 --> 00:34:49.981]  And it's just, I have prayed before a few times on air when it comes upon me to do it, but it's just, again it just doesn't feel right to me to sit here and pray on air unless I feel like doing it.
[00:34:50.801 --> 00:34:54.842]  And I don't want to institutionalize it and turn it into some type of, we all should pray.
[00:34:55.622 --> 00:35:05.544]  Pray that God lift the blinders off all our eyes, pray that God help us be good people and help us do the right thing and help us have courage and strength and do the things we need to do and that God lead us.
[00:35:08.135 --> 00:35:13.299]  With his Holy Spirit to be teachers and healers and people who go out and help in the community.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:27.128]  In fact, I think about how innocent children are, how pure they are, and I think about every day, I think about how does Alberto Gonzalez write memos saying they can torture children?
[00:35:27.148 --> 00:35:28.248]  How does John Yoo do that?
[00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:33.452]  I think about all the little children that have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the children
[00:35:34.364 --> 00:35:35.105]  Brain damaged.
[00:35:35.145 --> 00:35:41.690]  Everywhere I go, I see autistic children and I say, let me guess, it happened at 18 months with the third round of shots and they say, yes it did.
[00:35:44.972 --> 00:35:50.857]  And I say, let me guess, two days after the shots, your child stopped talking to you and stopped running around and was gone.
[00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:51.818]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[00:35:51.838 --> 00:35:52.398]  How'd you know?
[00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:53.939]  Well, the mercury.
[00:35:53.979 --> 00:35:55.881]  It builds up to toxic levels at that point.
[00:35:58.915 --> 00:36:00.237]  It just, it just tears me up.
[00:36:00.357 --> 00:36:02.719]  I mean, I don't even feel like talking on air right now because of this.
[00:36:02.779 --> 00:36:04.140]  I think, I mean, it's painful.
[00:36:05.722 --> 00:36:10.346]  And it isn't that I'm some bleeding heart weakling either.
[00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:13.729]  I believe the more strength you have, the more empathy you have.
[00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:17.072]  And it gives me great strength.
[00:36:17.112 --> 00:36:22.518]  When I think about how they're abusing children and the bad things this government's doing, I literally know I can hook 20 men.
[00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:28.129]  I mean, I know, and I wish it was that easy.
[00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:32.092]  I wish it was that easy where we could just go to Bunker Hill and just get it on.
[00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:45.181]  But the propaganda... Can't you just feel the evil?
[00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:46.882]  Can't you feel the pain?
[00:36:47.682 --> 00:36:54.387]  Don't you know the horrible things that innocent, innocent, meek people that can't protect themselves which happen to them right now?
[00:36:57.623 --> 00:37:04.506]  And I do pray to God that he'll curse every single child molester and government pervert and torture.
[00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:08.728]  And I've studied the enemy.
[00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:10.389]  They have horrible lives themselves.
[00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:11.629]  Their children die.
[00:37:11.689 --> 00:37:13.070]  They have horrible diseases.
[00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.470]  They're constantly unhappy.
[00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:22.054]  I mean, they live living hells as well, but they're so given over to their wickedness that all they know is to go deeper down the rat hole.
[00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:31.251]  I mean, they've declared martial law, they've abolished the governors, they've abolished posse commandatus, they've abolished the entire Bill of Rights.
[00:37:32.051 --> 00:37:33.592]  Keith Olbermann says 9 of the 10.
[00:37:33.712 --> 00:37:34.712]  That's not accurate.
[00:37:38.474 --> 00:37:39.374]  The third's gone too.
[00:37:40.815 --> 00:37:42.096]  They're quartering groups among us.
[00:37:42.116 --> 00:37:51.800]  That really means taxing you locally to pay for armed garrisons that oppress you and stop you at checkpoints and demand things of you and feed on you in a predatory fashion.
[00:37:57.563 --> 00:37:59.725]  There is so much beauty in the world.
[00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:02.888]  I constantly live in wonderment.
[00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:12.076]  I constantly, I mean to watch a little gecko running along the wall under a lamp at my house hunting, eating mosquitoes last night.
[00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:19.322]  To just sit there in a chair and look down into the grass and watch little doodle bugs and ants foraging.
[00:38:21.224 --> 00:38:24.287]  To see the little birds in the trees and the deer and the
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:30.162]  The lakes and the brooks and the ocean and the clouds and a thunderstorm coming into the coast.
[00:38:31.402 --> 00:38:40.206]  To see all of the beautiful people and the art and the goodness and just all of God's handiwork all around me.
[00:38:40.246 --> 00:38:46.188]  It just makes me love God so much and thank God for all we've been given this beautiful creation.
[00:38:46.808 --> 00:38:53.611]  All the good things He gave us if we would just take it and care for it and be good caretakers and be good stewards.
[00:38:59.076 --> 00:39:00.417]  And we've not been good stewards.
[00:39:02.057 --> 00:39:27.647]  And there's this paradox, all of the beauty and the innocence and the gifts and the blessings that we have, and then you look, infesting it everywhere, sitting on it, feeding on it, the paratacism, the piratical bloodlust, a feeding, a disease-stinking smell of death, just these black captains
[00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:47.484]  Sitting over every city, sitting over every hamlet, ripping off the people, stealing, embezzling, grabbing people's children for no reason, a huge prison sprawling, new ones being built everywhere, brain-dead police who think it's macho to abuse the population.
[00:39:51.465 --> 00:39:53.446]  It's just horrible.
[00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:57.988]  It makes it that much worse, having all this evil set
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.541]  Like a dark stone at the head of all the beauty that's around it.
[00:40:08.262 --> 00:40:23.006]  It's, it's, it's... You know, to see that evil resting cradled, and to see the ignorance of the masses, to not, I mean, to want to warn them, to have a burning desire
[00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:29.072]  To warn them of the bullying and abuse they're already under.
[00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:36.736]  To try to wake them, to show them the myriad legion of crimes being committed.
[00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:40.298]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:40:40.338 --> 00:40:42.659]  I talk a lot about it, but I want it to burn into your brain.
[00:40:45.301 --> 00:40:47.482]  There is no law that you have to be vaccinated.
[00:40:49.597 --> 00:40:51.638]  Just a few years ago it was 20-something vaccines.
[00:40:51.678 --> 00:40:52.739]  Now 34 vaccines.
[00:40:52.779 --> 00:40:56.921]  Now this year they want to be 45 vaccines that they tell you it's the law.
[00:40:56.961 --> 00:40:57.561]  You've got to take them.
[00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:58.321]  There is no law.
[00:40:59.462 --> 00:41:07.546]  The news, all in unison, radio, TV, print, coast-to-coast, tells everyone simultaneously starting a month before school, it's the law.
[00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:09.306]  You'll be arrested if your child doesn't take it.
[00:41:11.387 --> 00:41:13.348]  Autism, again, went from 1 in 25,000 24 years ago to
[00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:19.135]  One in 168 two years ago.
[00:41:19.175 --> 00:41:20.696]  The new numbers just came out.
[00:41:22.238 --> 00:41:23.179]  New federal numbers.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:24.860]  One in 85.
[00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:29.385]  In a few years it will be one in 50.
[00:41:29.505 --> 00:41:33.128]  I think it will end up being a third of us.
[00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.772]  And people will just say, oh, it's normal to have the sperm count down by 80%.
[00:41:37.853 --> 00:41:39.214]  It's normal to have
[00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:49.090]  Testosterone down by 25% from 1950 to 1986, and now the new numbers just came in, down another 20%.
[00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:55.194]  Men's testosterone level is almost cut in half.
[00:41:56.214 --> 00:41:57.555]  People say, why aren't men men anymore?
[00:41:57.595 --> 00:41:59.376]  Because they put hormones in the plastics.
[00:42:00.596 --> 00:42:04.698]  There's hormones in, I mean this is admitted, there's hormones in the styrofoam.
[00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:06.339]  It's in the packaging.
[00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:09.501]  Your girls are hyper female, your males are female.
[00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.110]  10-year-old girls look like they're 18.
[00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:15.551]  That's why women's breast cancer is spiraling.
[00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:18.391]  Direct studies and links to the increase in hormones.
[00:42:18.451 --> 00:42:23.532]  I mean, they'll tell you that hormone replacement, when these women keep taking estrogen at 50, 60, that's why they get breast cancer.
[00:42:23.552 --> 00:42:25.293]  Well, what do you think it is to your girls?
[00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:27.973]  Why do you think 18-year-old girls?
[00:42:28.173 --> 00:42:38.395]  I know several families here in Austin who have wonderful, bright, intelligent, enchanting daughters who've got breast cancer when they're in high school.
[00:42:39.335 --> 00:42:41.777]  When they're in college with no history of it!
[00:42:42.137 --> 00:42:44.399]  Childhood leukemia is off the charts!
[00:42:44.879 --> 00:42:46.640]  We are cursed with plagues!
[00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:52.105]  And do we stop using cell phones?
[00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:52.185]  No.
[00:42:52.325 --> 00:42:54.306]  Because they cook our brains.
[00:42:54.726 --> 00:42:56.168]  Do we stop drinking out of a plastic?
[00:42:56.228 --> 00:42:56.488]  No.
[00:42:56.528 --> 00:42:59.850]  Can you even find packaged drinks now in glass?
[00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:00.591]  It's very rare.
[00:43:03.394 --> 00:43:06.276]  Sodium and stannous fluoride floods our water supply.
[00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:08.758]  Top scientists, major universities say it's deadly poison.
[00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:11.480]  Causes cancers, bone fractures.
[00:43:12.621 --> 00:43:16.364]  It's a toxic sedative with a calmative effect.
[00:43:17.925 --> 00:43:20.027]  The Nazi documents said they used it in the camps.
[00:43:20.327 --> 00:43:23.050]  Pulitzer Prize winning World War II history books have it in it.
[00:43:25.612 --> 00:43:29.074]  It isn't a conspiracy theory that cell phones cook your brain.
[00:43:30.655 --> 00:43:32.517]  It isn't a conspiracy theory that
[00:43:33.832 --> 00:43:43.219]  There are dioxins and other chemicals in the plastics that are feminizing our men and giving our women cancer.
[00:43:46.642 --> 00:43:52.266]  It isn't our opinion that female fertility is plummeting and male fertility is plummeting even further.
[00:43:53.576 --> 00:43:54.777]  We are under attack.
[00:43:54.937 --> 00:43:56.738]  We are having our population attacked.
[00:43:57.258 --> 00:44:00.060]  Population control mechanisms have been launched against us.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.041]  It's coordinated.
[00:44:01.581 --> 00:44:02.521]  It's orchestrated.
[00:44:02.962 --> 00:44:05.083]  It's so diabolical!
[00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:12.067]  In the last few days, I've been meaning to apologize to police.
[00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.091]  Because I've done destructive things on air.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:29.404]  I know full well that more than half of you are good men and women who naively signed up because you had an instinct to defend people and to right wrong.
[00:44:32.826 --> 00:44:39.970]  I just get so infuriated when I see the videos of police beating up innocent people and then charging them with assaulting them.
[00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:44.132]  I get upset when I read about you killing people with your taser guns.
[00:44:44.172 --> 00:44:48.475]  I get upset when I read about the corruption and the crime lab frauds and the
[00:44:49.324 --> 00:44:53.205]  And I see the police unions defending bad cops instead of you cleaning your own house.
[00:44:54.945 --> 00:45:07.968]  And I feel threatened by you because I know that you've been brainwashed with the general public and you've been indoctrinated incrementally by the best mind scientists there are to break you down and make you do evil in the name of good.
[00:45:09.648 --> 00:45:13.129]  And so I lash out and say things like, you just want to mow us down the streets.
[00:45:13.729 --> 00:45:18.870]  Regardless of whether you want to or not, most of you will do it, even if you're the type that'll change an old lady's tire.
[00:45:19.972 --> 00:45:21.513]  I know a lot of you are great people and you do.
[00:45:22.574 --> 00:45:28.978]  In that peer pressure system, you will do wrong in your little gang psychology and I just, I get mad.
[00:45:34.002 --> 00:45:38.385]  That you'll go to people's houses with the IRS when they don't have a warrant or a ruling and take their things.
[00:45:38.725 --> 00:45:39.846]  You'll go to their business and do it.
[00:45:39.866 --> 00:45:40.806]  You'll take their children.
[00:45:40.826 --> 00:45:42.948]  I mean, I know the law.
[00:45:43.028 --> 00:45:43.608]  I've studied it.
[00:45:44.929 --> 00:45:45.790]  It isn't my opinion.
[00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:54.012]  And the sickest thing is, I know you're some of the most abused and used people out there.
[00:45:55.293 --> 00:45:57.914]  And you're like the general public, you can't see the forest for the trees.
[00:46:00.896 --> 00:46:08.620]  I mean, do you think I make it up that there are these White House memos that the Pentagon use that say they can torture children with pliers?
[00:46:11.261 --> 00:46:18.725]  Do you think we make it up when we read New York newspapers where they take little children, little children,
[00:46:20.183 --> 00:46:21.244]  Eight, ten years old.
[00:46:21.264 --> 00:46:23.807]  I just think of the individual cases.
[00:46:25.329 --> 00:46:29.653]  Healthy little children and they make them drink pesticide until they die.
[00:46:31.095 --> 00:46:35.059]  And the mere fact that they can put that in the newspaper
[00:46:37.868 --> 00:46:42.091]  And that valiant CPS workers, because you don't think it's that valiant.
[00:46:42.131 --> 00:46:44.493]  I mean, you think anybody would report that, but they're in that peer pressure motor.
[00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:46.735]  Like, well, I'm a CPS worker for 20 years.
[00:46:46.755 --> 00:46:54.621]  We interviewed one of them, and we go take the little kids from the parents, and then we take them to these private facilities, and they test drugs and pesticides and chemicals on them.
[00:46:55.382 --> 00:46:59.365]  They put chemical swabs on their little backs and see what it does to their skin.
[00:46:59.385 --> 00:47:02.828]  And it goes on all over the place.
[00:47:05.151 --> 00:47:06.572]  It's like the Chicago Tribune.
[00:47:06.893 --> 00:47:11.056]  Two different articles about child kidnapping rings run by DynCorp and Halliburton.
[00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:15.660]  And no one's arrested.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.520]  I mean, that's the thing.
[00:47:16.621 --> 00:47:17.962]  It's like they put it out in the open.
[00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:19.243]  Yeah, we torture children.
[00:47:19.283 --> 00:47:20.464]  Yeah, we kidnap them.
[00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:28.090]  Yeah, there's almost four trillion now missing from the Pentagon.
[00:47:28.811 --> 00:47:30.432]  I mean, the government's totally criminal!
[00:47:33.063 --> 00:47:36.024]  Why should I even continue to cover it and document it?
[00:47:36.445 --> 00:47:37.525]  There's not even a need!
[00:47:39.066 --> 00:47:39.667]  It's proven!
[00:47:39.687 --> 00:47:40.767]  It's prima facie!
[00:47:42.588 --> 00:47:43.449]  It's red-handed!
[00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:44.910]  A thousand times a thousand!
[00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:45.750]  Times a thousand!
[00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:46.871]  Times a thousand!
[00:47:48.972 --> 00:47:50.834]  I'm glad that Aaron just ran in and brought this to me.
[00:47:50.874 --> 00:47:52.575]  I saw this last night and forgot to cover it.
[00:47:52.675 --> 00:47:53.295]  It's in the stack.
[00:47:54.096 --> 00:47:54.876]  But he brought it in again.
[00:47:55.356 --> 00:47:57.858]  Diebold demands HBO cancel film on voting machines.
[00:47:57.898 --> 00:48:01.120]  Beth Harris' film proving that it's a total fraud network.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:03.861]  Diebold Inc.
[00:48:03.901 --> 00:48:08.184]  demanded that a cable network HBO cancel a documentary that questions the integrity of its voting machines.
[00:48:08.284 --> 00:48:09.304]  Questions its integrity?
[00:48:09.645 --> 00:48:11.306]  Calling the program inaccurate and unfair.
[00:48:12.126 --> 00:48:15.989]  The program, Hacking Democracy, is scheduled to debut November 2nd.
[00:48:16.009 --> 00:48:16.810]  That's tonight.
[00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.151]  Five days before the 2006 U.S.
[00:48:19.792 --> 00:48:20.532]  midterm elections.
[00:48:20.993 --> 00:48:22.994]  By the way, crew, I want this tape.
[00:48:23.134 --> 00:48:25.656]  Do any of you have the digital super package?
[00:48:25.696 --> 00:48:27.257]  I don't think we have that here at the office.
[00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:30.379]  We have basic cable or maybe the medium thing.
[00:48:30.399 --> 00:48:30.679]  I don't know.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.780]  I don't think we have HBO here.
[00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:32.641]  We should.
[00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:34.572]  You don't really watch much TV, though.
[00:48:34.933 --> 00:48:36.655]  It's a tool to track the enemy, and that's it.
[00:48:38.356 --> 00:48:42.140]  The program, Hacking Democracy, is scheduled to debut November 2nd, five days before the 2006 U.S.
[00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:43.902]  midterm elections.
[00:48:43.942 --> 00:48:45.804]  The film claims Diebold claims.
[00:48:46.305 --> 00:48:47.986]  Voting machines aren't tamper-proof.
[00:48:48.187 --> 00:48:49.628]  They're designed for fraud.
[00:48:49.668 --> 00:48:51.410]  Their own engineers have quit and gone public.
[00:48:52.077 --> 00:48:54.739]  And can be manipulated to change voting results.
[00:48:55.219 --> 00:48:58.542]  Hacking democracy is replete with material examples of inaccurate reporting.
[00:48:58.982 --> 00:49:15.194]  Diebold election system president David Byrd said in a letter to HBO president and chief executive officer Chris Albrecht, posted on Diebold's website short of pulling the film, the October 30th letter, asked for disclaimers to be aired and for HBO to post Diebold's response on its website.
[00:49:16.856 --> 00:49:21.239]  Inaccuracies in the film include the assertion that Diebold's election system unit is based in Allen, Texas.
[00:49:22.634 --> 00:49:23.775]  Well, I know in many states it was over 60%.
[00:49:23.815 --> 00:49:29.560]  So, they're going to go look at 10,000 articles written and things covered and say that, well, the press has not made a few mistakes.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.621]  Yeah, hadn't reported how bad you are.
[00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:56.198]  Bird's Letter said Diebold wasn't the electronic voting business in 2000 when disputes over ballots in Florida delayed President Bush's victory for more than a month and raised questions about the reliability of electronic voting machines.
[00:49:57.018 --> 00:49:58.839]  Yeah, but the companies they bought into were.
[00:50:00.177 --> 00:50:01.017]  We stand by the film.
[00:50:01.157 --> 00:50:06.199]  HBO spokesman Jeff Cousin said in the interview, we have no intention of withdrawing it from the schedule.
[00:50:06.619 --> 00:50:10.660]  It appears that the film Diebold is responding to is not the film HBO is airing.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.720]  HBO is a unit of Time Warner Inc.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.241]  And frankly, I've heard a little bit about this film.
[00:50:15.261 --> 00:50:18.241]  There's a lot of, let's just say it's watered down.
[00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:19.082]  I like Bev Harris.
[00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:25.523]  She's been on the show, but you know, I mean, what was it?
[00:50:25.603 --> 00:50:28.304]  Nine different executives of Diebold are convicted felons.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:36.241]  Everywhere their machines are in, I mean... I can't do so much of it, that's why I didn't get into it.
[00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:38.402]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:50:39.782 --> 00:50:41.363]  It's totally ridiculous.
[00:50:42.763 --> 00:50:46.704]  If anything, this film won't be one-tenth as hardcore as it should be.
[00:50:46.724 --> 00:50:48.804]  Alright, I'm going to blast through your calls quickly.
[00:50:48.844 --> 00:50:56.426]  Patrick, Canyon, others, when we get back, stay with us.
[00:51:04.605 --> 00:51:07.786]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.126 --> 00:51:10.026]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.426 --> 00:51:18.088]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.768 --> 00:51:25.829]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:33.071]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.604 --> 00:51:37.625]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.945 --> 00:51:41.466]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.926 --> 00:51:43.827]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.187 --> 00:51:48.108]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:15.962]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:52:16.423 --> 00:52:17.924]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:52:18.365 --> 00:52:20.086]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:52:20.467 --> 00:52:22.249]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:23.290]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:25.952]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:52:26.212 --> 00:52:26.532]  What?
[00:52:26.973 --> 00:52:37.461]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:52:37.741 --> 00:52:39.923]  You know, this is a terrific cabin!

[00:52:42.905 --> 00:52:44.085]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:10.465]  Here to build the big guns.
[00:54:13.053 --> 00:54:15.295]  Is it bell that has planes?
[00:54:17.357 --> 00:54:19.158]  Is it bell all the bombs?
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.042]  Is it hide behind walls?
[00:54:25.964 --> 00:54:27.825]  Is it hide behind desks?
[00:54:30.127 --> 00:54:34.330]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks

[00:54:53.888 --> 00:55:00.534]  You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes.
[00:55:02.594 --> 00:55:03.355]  Welcome back!
[00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:03.915]  By the way, uh...
[00:55:32.159 --> 00:55:34.360]  Terror Storm on the Amazon charts went as high as $51.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.981]  It's now falling back to $58.
[00:55:36.281 --> 00:55:37.962]  You can't beat it for $11.19.
[00:55:38.063 --> 00:55:42.065]  We basically make nothing off of this.
[00:55:43.446 --> 00:55:44.226]  I calculated it.
[00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:46.147]  I make a little over $0.50 each sale.
[00:55:46.267 --> 00:55:47.468]  It's not even about the money.
[00:55:47.528 --> 00:55:49.289]  You know I put it out for free on Google Video.
[00:55:49.729 --> 00:55:55.093]  Go get high quality DVD over three hours, the film, and then 68 minutes of extras at Amazon.
[00:55:55.533 --> 00:55:59.135]  We discounted it so low when we sold it to them just so it can get out to people.
[00:55:59.935 --> 00:56:04.419]  We sold it to Amazon for 60% off, so we sold it to them for about $4.50 apiece.
[00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:07.301]  We could have sold it to them for $20 apiece, but we didn't.
[00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:09.683]  We set it low so it would sell.
[00:56:10.504 --> 00:56:18.970]  Superman's like $90 something now, and I was just looking there in the break, and Talladega Nights is $90 something, and there's Terror Storm at $58 right now.
[00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.892]  Please go on there and buy 10, 15, 20 copies.
[00:56:20.912 --> 00:56:21.272]  Spend $200 bucks.
[00:56:21.332 --> 00:56:21.492]  Get it.
[00:56:26.269 --> 00:56:27.750]  And, uh, get it out to everybody!
[00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:28.691]  Use it!
[00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:35.395]  This is a way to get high quality, you know, in the nice packaging with the, with the, you know, color stamp on the top of the disc, and it looks really nice.
[00:56:35.455 --> 00:56:36.575]  It's a great gift to give people.
[00:56:36.615 --> 00:56:37.676]  Don't wait till the holidays.
[00:56:38.156 --> 00:56:38.897]  Don't wait till Christmas.
[00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:39.597]  Just get it now.
[00:56:39.697 --> 00:56:43.700]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, big links over to where you can get it.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:55.227]  You can also get America Freedom to Fascism for $19.95 from us, Aaron Russo's new film, and get TerrorStorm for $9.95 at InfoWars.com off of our secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[00:56:57.361 --> 00:57:04.668]  So again, go to Infowars.com for $29.95, get both films, or go to Amazon.com for $11.19, get Terror Storm.
[00:57:04.688 --> 00:57:11.214]  Please help us, because when it gets up in the top ten, it'll go supernova, and we can push it up there if you go in there and buy them in mass.
[00:57:12.415 --> 00:57:14.397]  Let's go ahead and go to Patrick in Ohio.
[00:57:14.437 --> 00:57:15.418]  Thanks for holding, Patrick.
[00:57:16.178 --> 00:57:17.179]  Yeah, Alex, how's it going?
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:17.960]  Pretty good.
[00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:22.444]  You know, I'm in Ohio here, and I went out and voted early.
[00:57:23.786 --> 00:57:29.047]  Go out and vote and have my vote all corrupted by these crazy electronic voting machines.
[00:57:29.107 --> 00:57:33.728]  But reading here on the internet, you know, they're having the same problem there in Florida with their early voting as well.
[00:57:33.768 --> 00:57:37.589]  Well, they feed the other ballots into machines so it doesn't do anything.
[00:57:38.429 --> 00:57:45.130]  Yeah, it just, it is, you know, I work with computers and, you know, it's... Keep going, I'm going to hold you over.
[00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:46.250]  Alright.
[00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.031]  You know, with these voting machines, it's very easy to hack them.
[00:57:49.051 --> 00:57:50.551]  You know, I work with computers and it's...
[00:57:51.743 --> 00:57:56.826]  It shocks me that people think that these things are so perfect and they're not.
[00:57:56.846 --> 00:57:58.847]  We need to look at the code.
[00:57:59.347 --> 00:58:01.949]  We need to make voting machines that are fair for all of us.
[00:58:02.189 --> 00:58:04.730]  Their engineers have gone public to risk their lives.
[00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.151]  They're designed for fraud.
[00:58:06.171 --> 00:58:08.953]  Their engineers have testified before state legislatures.
[00:58:09.233 --> 00:58:11.834]  They were hired to design them for fraud, my brother.
[00:58:11.854 --> 00:58:12.995]  Yeah, I hear ya.
[00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:16.617]  Anything else you want to add?
[00:58:17.273 --> 00:58:26.678]  Yeah, you know, I watched Terror Storm here about two months ago on the web, and I just find it a very excellent movie, and I'm glad you are providing this info for us.
[00:58:26.798 --> 00:58:27.579]  Well, tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:29.360]  I'm going to let you finish the other side in about ten minutes.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.680]  We're going to have Ralph Steadman on.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.041]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.204 --> 00:58:45.828]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.868 --> 00:58:46.708]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:00.763 --> 00:59:01.844]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:03.326]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.086 --> 00:59:04.967]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.648 --> 00:59:09.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.852 --> 00:59:13.915]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.509 --> 00:59:31.109]  All right, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:31.129 --> 00:59:32.130]  We're now in the second hour.
[00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:43.193]  Coming up in the next segment for the Balance of the Hour, we're going to be extremely honored to be joined by Ralph Skedman, who does not need introduction to many of our listeners out across the United States and the planet.
[00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:50.674]  He is a British cartoonist and caricaturist, and we'll tell you about his new book and some of his other books.
[00:59:51.055 --> 00:59:52.655]  Two of the people that work here in my office are
[00:59:53.827 --> 00:59:59.933]  I wouldn't call them fans, but admirers and followers of Mr. Steadman.
[01:00:00.653 --> 01:00:05.238]  And last night, I read one of his books in the past.
[01:00:06.179 --> 01:00:07.320]  I admired a lot of his art.
[01:00:07.841 --> 01:00:12.786]  Friends, of course, with Hunter F. Thompson and many other notables in gonzo journalism.
[01:00:13.606 --> 01:00:16.950]  So we'll be joined by him coming up in about five minutes.
[01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:21.204]  Then we have the Episcopal priest in New York joining us, Frank Morales.
[01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:24.645]  Bush has declared martial law with the new Military Funding Act.
[01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:37.291]  The military legislation, not just the HR 6166 Military Commissions Act, but the Military Funding Bill
[01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:39.573]  I'm speechless right now that it's gotten
[01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:01.189]  Gotten this, this bad, this fast.
[01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.030]  I wanted to let a caller finish up.
[01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:06.232]  Patrick in Ohio, who we cut short in the last hour.
[01:01:06.252 --> 01:01:10.394]  You were talking about how you're a programmer yourself and how these voting machines need to be trackable.
[01:01:10.814 --> 01:01:19.658]  Sir, their own engineers have gone public and testified in Florida and other states that they were hired and told to put in wireless software and to design it to be hacked.
[01:01:19.678 --> 01:01:24.541]  They have wireless cards in these so they can all be given their orders.
[01:01:25.759 --> 01:01:28.900]  to steal elections and they're flipping it here in Austin and San Antonio.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.041]  I have the news reports today.
[01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:32.142]  Yeah, I've seen them Alex.
[01:01:32.202 --> 01:01:35.863]  I've seen all those reports that you talk about and it doesn't shock me.
[01:01:35.903 --> 01:01:42.106]  You know, people can go around, you know, you have a wireless network in your home and people can just go in and hack it around that too and get in.
[01:01:42.386 --> 01:01:44.127]  So that doesn't surprise me either.
[01:01:44.727 --> 01:01:53.030]  It's just, you know, I've seen that video you're talking about where the guy testified here in Ohio about how he could just program the vote and make it flip from 51 to 49
[01:01:54.727 --> 01:01:55.668]  And that person wins.
[01:01:55.868 --> 01:01:58.930]  And that just ticks me off, and I'm sure it ticks you off, too.
[01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:00.811]  Well, we caught them doing it in Austin in 98.
[01:02:01.392 --> 01:02:08.777]  They were still feeding the Scantron ballots, again, similar to an SAT test score system, into computers themselves.
[01:02:08.837 --> 01:02:10.318]  And look, look, I've worked elections.
[01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:12.380]  I've seen them steal it right in front of me.
[01:02:13.032 --> 01:02:23.765]  I mean, I've been there stacking the scantrons to stick them in, and somebody's winning by 60%, and I'm talking to everybody else, they go, yeah, they're winning, and then at the end of the night, they lose by, you know, they get 8% of the vote.
[01:02:23.805 --> 01:02:25.007]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:28.230]  What they're doing, and again, it's like Mexico.
[01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:38.113]  They stole the election from everybody, they rioted down there for two months, and finally in Oaxaca this weekend, they machine-gunned a bunch of people, including an American journalist, shot him right in the chest.
[01:02:38.153 --> 01:02:49.456]  I mean, and by the way, the Bush and EO cons were involved there with several big groups, several big consulting firms, PR firms, that they hired to do that down in Mexico.
[01:02:49.736 --> 01:02:51.517]  Yeah, these guys are all over the place.
[01:02:51.577 --> 01:02:54.198]  I mean, Bush just bought some land down in Paraguay,
[01:02:56.283 --> 01:02:58.767]  I think he had his daughter down there negotiating that deal.
[01:02:59.207 --> 01:03:02.312]  I mean, he's in bed with these guys in Saudi Arabia.
[01:03:02.332 --> 01:03:04.255]  I mean, he's in bed with all these people.
[01:03:04.275 --> 01:03:05.737]  Listen, listen.
[01:03:05.797 --> 01:03:06.758]  It's happening, folks.
[01:03:06.818 --> 01:03:09.783]  And you know, in all the years I've been on the radio, 12 years, I haven't talked like this.
[01:03:10.439 --> 01:03:12.221]  We are in martial law now.
[01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:13.883]  The question is, will they try to implement it?
[01:03:14.143 --> 01:03:16.085]  He has declared the power of Caesar.
[01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:18.647]  He has declared the power of Adolf Hitler.
[01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:21.671]  He has declared the power of Joseph Stalin, of Mao Zedong.
[01:03:22.892 --> 01:03:25.995]  North Com announced last week that they are in control of the U.S.
[01:03:26.055 --> 01:03:26.836]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:28.012]  You bet.
[01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:29.793]  Ralph Steadman on the other side.
[01:03:29.834 --> 01:03:30.594]  I'm told we have him.
[01:03:30.634 --> 01:03:31.936]  Really honored to have him joining us.
[01:03:31.976 --> 01:03:32.977]  We're very thankful for that.
[01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:36.821]  We'll be discussing all of this with him and a lot more when we get back.
[01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:37.602]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:03:37.642 --> 01:03:44.089]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net and JonesReport.com.
[01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:48.034]  My new film Terror Storm is in the top 50 of Amazon videos right now.
[01:03:56.477 --> 01:03:56.937]  It's here!
[01:03:57.157 --> 01:04:01.940]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:09.964]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.644 --> 01:04:17.687]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:24.971]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:29.524]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.804 --> 01:04:33.327]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.688]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.048 --> 01:04:39.971]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:04:40.492 --> 01:04:48.257]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:53.228 --> 01:04:53.988]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.148 --> 01:04:54.909]  Terrorism!
[01:04:55.009 --> 01:05:01.051]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:01.311 --> 01:05:02.911]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:05.632]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:06.032 --> 01:05:20.597]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.637 --> 01:05:20.957]  government.
[01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.898]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.078 --> 01:05:29.202]  Yes, it's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:33.845]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:34.105 --> 01:05:39.488]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:40.809]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.889 --> 01:05:41.409]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.469 --> 01:05:43.511]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:58.815]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:05:58.835 --> 01:06:05.259]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:06:05.599 --> 01:06:08.861]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:06:09.261 --> 01:06:11.262]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[01:06:11.503 --> 01:06:16.906]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:21.789]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring
[01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:22.430]  We're good to go.
[01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:50.093]  Well, the last week, we have interviewed Gord Vidal on there, we've interviewed
[01:07:14.432 --> 01:07:16.053]  High-level CIA officers on 9-11.
[01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:22.236]  We've, of course, interviewed the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiklitz about the globalist engineering and economic collapse.
[01:07:23.077 --> 01:07:28.640]  I'm really proud of my producers getting this amazing guest, and we've got with us now Ralph Steadman.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:33.722]  I was just going over one of his books again last night, The Joke's Over, an amazing book.
[01:07:34.543 --> 01:07:37.104]  And, of course, he doesn't need to be introduced to many of you.
[01:07:37.144 --> 01:07:40.426]  If I tried to go over his bio, we'd burn the rest of the hour we have left with him.
[01:07:41.209 --> 01:07:53.997]  But he, of course, is a British cartoonist and caricaturist, one of the best, and a writer, and was good friends with Hunter S. Thompson and many other luminaries in the alternative media.
[01:07:54.617 --> 01:08:04.803]  And he joins us now from San Francisco to talk about his view of the world, because I was reading the jokes over
[01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:06.676]  Well, I think you're troubled.
[01:08:06.696 --> 01:08:07.696]  You sound like a troubled man over there.
[01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.237]  I think we're all troubled.
[01:08:09.257 --> 01:08:11.478]  I mean, any honest man should be quaking in their boots right now.
[01:08:35.894 --> 01:08:41.576]  I actually had a piece of voting wisdom I wrote down, which is who can a trusting human being vote for?
[01:08:42.136 --> 01:08:43.896]  Who is old enough and who is wise enough?
[01:08:44.277 --> 01:08:48.818]  Who is so devious and cunning that they can perceive our darkest unspoken desires?
[01:08:49.318 --> 01:08:53.299]  Who can outwit the barbarous hordes beyond the boundaries of a place we call home?
[01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:58.861]  And who can give our trembling souls the sense of security we only ever knew at our mother's breast?
[01:08:59.548 --> 01:09:06.234]  How can we vote for the noblest and best when we want the most manipulative, the most ruthless, the most sadistic?
[01:09:06.574 --> 01:09:10.457]  Who is man or woman enough to fulfill our widest and most elastic desires?
[01:09:10.837 --> 01:09:14.240]  Who dares step forward to represent and quench our appetites?
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.481]  Is that a good start?
[01:09:16.322 --> 01:09:17.383]  Wow, did you just write that?
[01:09:18.003 --> 01:09:20.245]  Yes, did you like it?
[01:09:20.385 --> 01:09:24.188]  Yes, thank you for sharing that here with this virgin reading with us.
[01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:26.991]  Well, you know, voting wisdom, I call it.
[01:09:27.975 --> 01:09:32.057]  Because I think in a funny kind of way, well, America does.
[01:09:32.097 --> 01:09:32.918]  I don't think we do.
[01:09:32.938 --> 01:09:35.179]  We don't want honest leaders.
[01:09:35.239 --> 01:09:44.745]  We want devious, cunning people who can help us to win whatever we have to win to make us feel safe in our beds.
[01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:50.088]  I'm not sure what it is, but I don't, I just, since I came to America in 1970, I mean,
[01:09:52.369 --> 01:09:54.329]  Things have changed a hell of a lot.
[01:09:54.409 --> 01:10:01.791]  But in fact, I did feel then the screaming lifestyle of America was alive and well, and just getting underway.
[01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:11.393]  You know, Nixon, well upset Hunter S. Thompson, because Hunter cared a lot about his constitution, and about the rights of man, about Thomas Paine.
[01:10:12.073 --> 01:10:19.255]  And it just seemed to me that that's what really made him rail against things.
[01:10:19.275 --> 01:10:20.935]  That gonzo was a form of
[01:10:21.625 --> 01:10:26.909]  of outrage against the real outrages of government administration.
[01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:33.634]  Absolutely, and thank you for sharing those amazing words with us.
[01:10:33.654 --> 01:10:35.616]  I'm sure we'll transcribe and get it up on the web.
[01:10:36.376 --> 01:10:37.677]  I don't even know where to start here.
[01:10:37.758 --> 01:10:39.219]  You know, you boiled it down.
[01:10:39.259 --> 01:10:40.059]  You crystallized it.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.160]  I am troubled.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.841]  I'm more troubled than I've ever been in my life.
[01:10:43.302 --> 01:10:47.905]  I feel like I've been robbed because I've been worldly enough in my life to not be naive.
[01:10:47.945 --> 01:10:51.228]  I've seen the underbelly of things, and I've studied a lot of history,
[01:10:51.926 --> 01:11:03.758]  And we're seeing a classical repeat with a type of high-tech sci-fi Orwellian Brave New World overlay that it seems like the elite has gone totally insane.
[01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:08.903]  I mean, they know what they're doing, but it's like a psychopath consciously knowing what he's doing.
[01:11:08.943 --> 01:11:13.767]  And just because he does it in a cold-blooded manner doesn't mean it's not just totally out of the pits of hell.
[01:11:14.248 --> 01:11:15.369]  But it's just also not
[01:11:16.704 --> 01:11:25.250]  It's not necessarily weaponry as much as toys, electronic toys, things that people know exactly how to use for the worst of purposes.
[01:11:25.871 --> 01:11:40.661]  The way of stripping you of all your personal thoughts and information and giving nothing return except a rip-off.
[01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:42.943]  You know, it's as though
[01:11:43.553 --> 01:11:46.514]  Ripping people off has become a way of life now.
[01:11:46.814 --> 01:11:51.595]  I mean, the government, first of all, is run by corporate management.
[01:11:51.715 --> 01:11:52.315]  It certainly is.
[01:11:53.115 --> 01:11:54.676]  It's not run by fine men.
[01:11:54.716 --> 01:11:59.617]  I mean, where are the Thomas Jeffersons and the Benjamin Franklins of today?
[01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:02.038]  Were there ever anyone after them?
[01:12:02.138 --> 01:12:08.339]  Or were they just all suits who decided what they could do now?
[01:12:08.579 --> 01:12:11.620]  They've instilled in people the idea that they have rights.
[01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:30.922]  And then they systematically strip them away and make them feel as though there is nothing in life that they could possibly realize about those rights that they have and have also fought for.
[01:12:30.942 --> 01:12:40.229]  They're being just taken away and it's going to be okay because the people that are really in charge are
[01:12:46.024 --> 01:13:04.856]  I think it's kind of the point that Terry Gilliam makes in Brazil and Time Bandits and the same idea we get of where they take our souls away, take our families away, take the true sense of magic in the world away and they give us a toaster and a seven-speed hedge clipper and a texting mobile phone
[01:13:05.496 --> 01:13:13.018]  Until we're just a bunch of basically dehumanized animals flashing signets of status at each other.
[01:13:13.438 --> 01:13:18.880]  I think babies being born with mobile phones attached to their ears, you know.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.861]  They seem to walk around back home the same way.
[01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:26.662]  They seem to be on them all the time.
[01:13:26.963 --> 01:13:31.364]  They can only communicate with each other through these infernal little machines, you know.
[01:13:32.048 --> 01:13:35.250]  The fingers move across the keys so fast.
[01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:39.052]  They've learned a skill that they use for no good reason.
[01:13:39.072 --> 01:13:42.173]  It's not even interesting what they have to say.
[01:13:42.474 --> 01:13:54.460]  It's the world's been designed to take all of our energies and pump them into mindless trinkets and baubles that then is a self-fulfilling feedback loop ever expanding this black hole.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.341]  Well, they're distractions.
[01:13:56.821 --> 01:13:58.062]  And they're distractions for a reason.
[01:13:58.496 --> 01:14:02.182]  So that those who are in power can get on doing their filthy work.
[01:14:02.783 --> 01:14:06.590]  And what they're doing now is definitely that.
[01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.517]  This thing you heard in the last few days about John Kerry.
[01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:18.216]  I mean, okay, he should have perhaps apologized, because he'd said, more or less, that if he didn't get an education, he'd end up in Iraq.
[01:14:18.437 --> 01:14:21.379]  But it's petty disinfo to begin with.
[01:14:21.419 --> 01:14:22.180]  I got fooled.
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.903]  I got fooled by this, Ralph, just a day or two ago.
[01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:28.406]  I heard the clip on the radio and thought, well, that is kind of unfeeling, but it's true.
[01:14:28.426 --> 01:14:31.569]  And I'm not even defending Kerry, obviously an establishment guy.
[01:14:31.589 --> 01:14:33.491]  But then I went and saw the whole clip.
[01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:35.753]  He was making a joke about Bush.
[01:14:35.973 --> 01:14:36.193]  Yeah.
[01:14:36.213 --> 01:14:39.815]  He said Bush didn't get a good education, so he's got us stuck in Iraq.
[01:14:40.015 --> 01:14:43.678]  He was saying Bush was dumb, and they spun that and even fooled me!
[01:14:44.178 --> 01:14:52.303]  Yeah, well, of course they made it out that the soldiers in Iraq have been writing home or so forth saying, how dare you say that about us?
[01:14:52.663 --> 01:15:00.748]  We're out here sweating our guts out and being killed, and somebody back home can make a cheap joke, and not only make a cheap joke, but actually get it wrong.
[01:15:01.328 --> 01:15:05.311]  I mean, they've more or less made it seem as though, as though John Kerry
[01:15:05.976 --> 01:15:08.638]  Simply didn't know how to tell a joke properly, you know?
[01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:14.904]  But what about Bush at the press dinner two years ago saying, no WMDs here, no WMDs there?
[01:15:14.924 --> 01:15:18.246]  He's joking about and saying, bring it on and all this stuff.
[01:15:18.927 --> 01:15:22.190]  That whole, that is such a travesty.
[01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:28.915]  Have you ever, for instance, lost something in the sand on a beach somewhere within 50 yards?
[01:15:29.536 --> 01:15:29.776]  Yes.
[01:15:29.856 --> 01:15:31.577]  And tried to find it, right?
[01:15:32.138 --> 01:15:32.358]  Yes.
[01:15:32.398 --> 01:15:33.279]  Well, can you imagine?
[01:15:33.723 --> 01:15:47.872]  The thousands of square miles around the Persian Gulf, there, around the Middle East, where Blix was supposed to find the mass destruction.
[01:15:48.412 --> 01:16:01.640]  And in fact, the possibility is so minimal, minuscule, that to find anything in the sandy regions, even
[01:16:02.452 --> 01:16:12.619]  foot below the ground or just just covered over somewhere and to be able to you couldn't police that amount of ground I mean it's inhuman to think about it.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.562]  Ralph Stevens, what are you most focused on these days?
[01:16:17.162 --> 01:16:18.483]  I mean what are you thinking about most?
[01:16:18.523 --> 01:16:19.224]  What's on your mind?
[01:16:20.665 --> 01:16:32.033]  Well I'm watching the cars on the high on these freeways that actually now it's not free it's not a freeway so much as a moving
[01:16:32.836 --> 01:16:33.216]  Mass.
[01:16:34.237 --> 01:16:36.799]  Everywhere we've been, there's a moving mass.
[01:16:37.339 --> 01:16:42.063]  And everyone is, everything is chucking out filth at such a rate.
[01:16:42.363 --> 01:16:43.044]  It's frantic.
[01:16:43.464 --> 01:16:44.505]  It's frightening.
[01:16:44.525 --> 01:16:52.190]  The whole thing is becoming... So, I mean, I wish that we could lose our memory and forget what a car was for.
[01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:57.274]  If all of us could suddenly lose our memory and look, what was war?
[01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.396]  What was a car for?
[01:16:59.776 --> 01:17:01.097]  What are all these things around us?
[01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:02.730]  What the hell do you do with this?
[01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:14.994]  So that we suddenly have to fall back on common human ingenuity to make a fire and have a square meal.
[01:17:16.115 --> 01:17:17.775]  Even go out and hunt your own food again.
[01:17:17.935 --> 01:17:19.316]  That's what I'm going to be doing this weekend.
[01:17:19.856 --> 01:17:22.517]  Oh wow, that's interesting.
[01:17:23.297 --> 01:17:28.339]  It's the kind of thing I don't do a lot myself, but I have been fishing.
[01:17:29.502 --> 01:17:30.223]  I love fishing.
[01:17:31.024 --> 01:17:31.965]  What do you like to fish for?
[01:17:33.526 --> 01:17:34.287]  Trout mainly.
[01:17:34.607 --> 01:17:37.911]  Oh yeah, I'm not delicate or skilled enough to do that.
[01:17:37.931 --> 01:17:49.882]  Well I think it's quite a nice thing because I caught my first trout when I was about 10 and that was a thrill the moment that pull on the line, that sudden tremble.
[01:17:50.523 --> 01:17:51.624]  It's an amazing feeling.
[01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:53.251]  I thought I never forgot that.
[01:17:53.511 --> 01:17:54.612]  Yeah, I don't think people know.
[01:17:54.632 --> 01:17:59.996]  I mean, the original television was sitting around a fire with your friends and family, looking into those coals.
[01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:03.719]  And you know, that's the glow I like to see, that orange glow.
[01:18:03.739 --> 01:18:07.562]  But I drive by the houses in my neighborhood and every window's glowing blue.
[01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:08.183]  Yeah.
[01:18:08.983 --> 01:18:17.230]  I talked to folks that lived in New York, you know, 30, 40 years ago, and people then, you could see them living and fighting and arguing or dancing in their homes at night if you had a telescope and a high rise.
[01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:20.773]  Now I've been in New York at a high rise, you just see the blue glow in every window.
[01:18:21.676 --> 01:18:26.340]  Well, unfortunately, that's, I guess, how we correspond with each other, though.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:31.844]  That's how we actually make life bearable, perhaps.
[01:18:32.084 --> 01:18:32.224]  Yes.
[01:18:32.264 --> 01:18:37.208]  By sinking ourselves into an inalienable object which actually moves.
[01:18:38.109 --> 01:18:43.033]  And it's full of all sorts of ideas, opinions.
[01:18:43.473 --> 01:18:45.775]  Ralph Steadman, we've got a break right there.
[01:18:45.815 --> 01:18:46.455]  Please stay with us.
[01:18:46.475 --> 01:18:51.299]  I want to come back and talk about some of your new books that are out, The State of the World and Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:18:53.948 --> 01:18:55.089]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.970]  Today is November 2nd, 2006.
[01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:56.371]  Gold opened at $621.70.
[01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:58.293]  And one ounce gold coins could be purchased for $647.70.
[01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.635]  Again, that's $647.70 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:19:07.148 --> 01:19:20.059]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:19:20.519 --> 01:19:23.742]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:27.683]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:19:27.743 --> 01:19:30.763]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[01:19:31.204 --> 01:19:34.024]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:19:34.264 --> 01:19:34.704]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:19:47.147 --> 01:19:47.327]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:19:57.614 --> 01:20:04.736]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the communist world in the last days?
[01:20:05.576 --> 01:20:11.218]  Did you know that it predicts the confrontation between atheistic communism and the western world of Christianity?
[01:20:11.918 --> 01:20:15.339]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.

[01:22:58.101 --> 01:23:00.002]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.482 --> 01:23:03.284]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[01:23:21.973 --> 01:23:24.174]  I haven't read the whole book yet, but I read quite a bit of it last night.
[01:23:24.214 --> 01:23:25.095]  I just got it yesterday.
[01:23:25.675 --> 01:23:30.138]  Ralph Steadman on Hunter S. Thompson forward by Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:38.663]  Kurt Vonnegut, who, just out of the blue, really great guy, sent me a little hand-drawn piece of work saying thanks for the work I'd done on, I guess, 9-11.
[01:23:39.756 --> 01:23:43.219]  I'd love to get him on, but he says he's not doing interviews anymore.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.222]  Someday maybe we'll hear Kurt Vonnegut here.
[01:23:46.262 --> 01:23:51.946]  I'm so envious of people like Ralph Steadman, who's worked with and good friends with people like Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:57.831]  Talking about your new book, Ralph Steadman and Hunter S. Thompson, The Joke's Over, why the title, The Joke's Over?
[01:23:58.792 --> 01:24:01.774]  He said it himself to me in a letter, The Joke's Over, Ralph.
[01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:05.137]  You're filthy, find it, I'll read it, I've got it here.
[01:24:06.809 --> 01:24:07.990]  This time you've gone too far.
[01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:15.075]  Your brazen, slime-coated effort to cheat me out of 50% of earnings on this book is a horrible joke, and my lawyer will take it personally.
[01:24:15.655 --> 01:24:19.118]  It might be easier to just settle this thing with a one-time payment to me of £50,000.
[01:24:19.158 --> 01:24:22.660]  That would be easier than haggling about royalties later on, eh?
[01:24:23.501 --> 01:24:25.262]  Anyway, here's your stinking foreword.
[01:24:25.282 --> 01:24:26.783]  I was asking for a foreword for my book.
[01:24:27.383 --> 01:24:28.744]  Tuck with the bull, get the horn.
[01:24:28.844 --> 01:24:29.285]  Why not?
[01:24:29.845 --> 01:24:30.986]  This could be good publicity.
[01:24:31.046 --> 01:24:32.127]  The Brits love scandals.
[01:24:32.247 --> 01:24:32.907]  Let's whoop it up!
[01:24:33.247 --> 01:24:35.469]  You're bleeding hosts under her stumps.
[01:24:36.192 --> 01:24:38.334]  That's where the jokes over came from.
[01:24:38.654 --> 01:24:42.837]  So he was a maniac.
[01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.779]  I've got a little piece here found.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.701]  Hunter Stockton Thompson, a glimpse.
[01:24:48.142 --> 01:24:49.102]  Just do me a favor.
[01:24:49.122 --> 01:24:50.103]  This is American Radio.
[01:24:50.143 --> 01:24:51.685]  Please try to be careful of the language.
[01:24:52.585 --> 01:24:54.667]  I know you don't want to excise... There'll be none of that.
[01:24:54.787 --> 01:24:55.267]  Okay, thank you.
[01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:57.629]  Right.
[01:24:58.570 --> 01:24:59.691]  I knew this man.
[01:24:59.891 --> 01:25:01.873]  He was wrong, but I loved him.
[01:25:02.093 --> 01:25:03.034]  35 years I've known him.
[01:25:03.814 --> 01:25:05.296]  35 summers with a length of 35 bitter winters.
[01:25:06.457 --> 01:25:08.578]  I doubt I will ever meet his like again.
[01:25:08.878 --> 01:25:16.162]  His presence cauterized my nerve ends, and he left me sickened with a joy of abject misery and downright wretchedness.
[01:25:16.542 --> 01:25:18.943]  Fear and loathing in Las Vegas was never a book.
[01:25:19.523 --> 01:25:33.950]  It was and is one man's attempt to come to terms with the loneliness of pure perception, unutterable fatigue with and flight from America's dysfunctional overindulgence, the fright of confronting America's
[01:25:36.247 --> 01:25:43.952]  Sickness inside his own skin drove the poor man on a trip to his own destruction, bringing him face to face with a mirror image of himself.
[01:25:44.552 --> 01:25:51.917]  In his heroic attempt to escape the dark morass of America's screaming lifestyle, he sold his soul to the devil for one moment of happiness.
[01:25:52.438 --> 01:25:55.119]  Like Faust, he lives in mortal torment.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.121]  But unlike Faust, he quite enjoys it, actually.
[01:25:58.742 --> 01:26:00.263]  But he would, wouldn't he?
[01:26:00.843 --> 01:26:01.383]  Amazing!
[01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:05.426]  That's how I felt about that, and that book was actually
[01:26:06.331 --> 01:26:08.491]  More of a response.
[01:26:08.851 --> 01:26:12.732]  I mean, summing it up, boiling it down, who was Hunter S. Thompson?
[01:26:12.752 --> 01:26:13.852]  I mean, what governed him?
[01:26:14.892 --> 01:26:16.833]  Well, I think he was an old-fashioned American.
[01:26:17.293 --> 01:26:18.813]  A kind of pioneer spirit.
[01:26:19.813 --> 01:26:22.354]  And a Southern gentleman, because he was from Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:26:23.354 --> 01:26:27.515]  And he couldn't stand them messing with his Constitution.
[01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:28.715]  I mean, his Constitution.
[01:26:29.215 --> 01:26:30.255]  It was sacred to him.
[01:26:30.275 --> 01:26:32.675]  I mean, it had been fought for.
[01:26:33.296 --> 01:26:35.176]  It had been written down in all
[01:26:38.094 --> 01:26:40.536]  Honesty and seriousness.
[01:26:41.417 --> 01:26:54.948]  And, you know, Thomas Paine's Right of Man and Thomas Jefferson coming from Paris, bringing with him the thoughts about having government by the people again, in spite of the hideousness of all that went on.
[01:26:54.988 --> 01:26:59.652]  But nevertheless, he brought his thoughts about democracy back to America.
[01:26:59.993 --> 01:27:03.856]  There was Benjamin Franklin and all those people who actually felt
[01:27:04.488 --> 01:27:07.189]  There was a decent way to get things done.
[01:27:07.529 --> 01:27:07.909]  Exactly.
[01:27:07.949 --> 01:27:15.091]  What do you think Hunter Thompson would think about Bush and basically overturning the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:25.714]  He's now done that with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 and the Detainee Military Commissions Bill.
[01:27:26.154 --> 01:27:33.136]  Well, he's really brought us face to face with martial law.
[01:27:34.748 --> 01:27:37.909]  Your whole country is, in fact, a kind of a fascist state.
[01:27:38.889 --> 01:28:01.013]  I mean, for all the lovely people I know here, they seem to be allowing fascism, a kind of bleak, empty atmosphere to pervade one of the fine cities, just incredible places.
[01:28:01.917 --> 01:28:04.358]  Even New York doesn't feel like New York anymore.
[01:28:05.758 --> 01:28:07.159]  Maybe that's to do with the no smoking.
[01:28:07.439 --> 01:28:08.940]  I don't know.
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:16.022]  Do you think it happened because Americans thought it couldn't happen here and are mesmerized by that culture of the television?
[01:28:16.502 --> 01:28:19.423]  I don't think they ever had a foreign policy before.
[01:28:20.704 --> 01:28:21.804]  They took on Vietnam.
[01:28:21.884 --> 01:28:23.265]  The French had left it.
[01:28:23.425 --> 01:28:26.246]  They took on Vietnam and it became a hideous
[01:28:27.421 --> 01:28:29.902]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:30.002 --> 01:28:31.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:56.821 --> 01:31:00.123]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:03.465]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:10.089]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:31:10.169 --> 01:31:14.611]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:31:14.831 --> 01:31:19.194]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:31:19.354 --> 01:31:24.717]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of US debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:31:25.197 --> 01:31:27.739]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:31:27.779 --> 01:31:32.041]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:32.962]  Treasury bonds.
[01:31:33.222 --> 01:31:37.845]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.666]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:18.462]  Coming up in the next hour, Episcopal Priest, 30-year activist against the crime syndicate, will be joining us.
[01:32:18.723 --> 01:32:20.064]  Frank Morales from New York.
[01:32:20.144 --> 01:32:21.866]  Bush moves towards martial law.
[01:32:21.887 --> 01:32:25.471]  He's done a great analysis of Bush's military
[01:32:26.738 --> 01:32:27.698]  Spending package for 2007.
[01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:29.759]  It's unprecedented.
[01:32:29.779 --> 01:32:32.400]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007.
[01:32:33.261 --> 01:32:35.222]  We are extremely honored to be joined by Ralph Stevens.
[01:32:35.242 --> 01:32:36.662]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment.
[01:32:37.142 --> 01:32:47.787]  My new film, Terror Storm, went on to Amazon two days ago and rocketed to 51, 51 of the top 100 DVD films available for Amazon.com.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:51.583]  And right now, today, it's settled back to 63 right now.
[01:32:51.683 --> 01:32:57.088]  Please go there and get your copy of Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:32:57.829 --> 01:33:02.713]  And it gets into the torture, the Gonzales Memo saying they can torture children.
[01:33:03.474 --> 01:33:07.778]  It gets into Bush buying $1.6 billion in fake news, paying off thousands of reporters.
[01:33:08.704 --> 01:33:11.628]  I mean, Armstrong Williams is the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:12.289 --> 01:33:14.372]  It gets into the lies that led us to war in Iraq.
[01:33:14.492 --> 01:33:15.654]  It covers it all.
[01:33:15.694 --> 01:33:21.663]  The White House memo where Bush and Blair met and said there were no WMDs, but they were going to try to stage their discovery.
[01:33:22.303 --> 01:33:23.746]  All of this is in the new film.
[01:33:23.826 --> 01:33:24.687]  Please get it!
[01:33:25.445 --> 01:33:25.685]  I think?
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:55.821]  I authorize you as the producer of the film, as the owner of the film, to make copies of it for non-profit educational purposes, to spread it in your area.
[01:33:55.901 --> 01:34:00.442]  But please, now is the time to go get it at Amazon.com and drive it up into the top ten.
[01:34:00.882 --> 01:34:01.962]  I think we can do it.
[01:34:02.482 --> 01:34:04.523]  Or you can call toll free to get the documentary 888-253-3139.
[01:34:04.643 --> 01:34:14.805]  Get Aaron Russo's America, Freedom from Fascism, and you can get Terror Storm with it for $9.95 at InfoWars.com, or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:17.746 --> 01:34:17.866]  3-1-3-9.
[01:34:17.926 --> 01:34:22.390]  The new book is The Joke's Over by Ralph Steadman.
[01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:24.211]  Ralph Steadman on Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:30.517]  It is a great book and it's also full of his artwork, full of photos, full of never-before-seen stuff.
[01:34:31.437 --> 01:34:39.264]  Last night I got home about midnight from working all day and I ended up staying up until about 1 reading several chapters.
[01:34:39.304 --> 01:34:43.628]  In fact, I've got a few areas bookmarked here I want to go over.
[01:34:45.248 --> 01:34:52.310]  And several areas concerning Bush and if he won the election coming to be a dictator, which has now happened.
[01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:54.791]  The question is, will he try to use the power he's declared?
[01:34:54.831 --> 01:34:57.851]  It's one thing to say you're a dictator, it's another thing to really be one.
[01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:02.652]  So we'll go over that here in just a few minutes with our guest.
[01:35:03.073 --> 01:35:08.574]  Ralph Stebbin, any particular websites or anything else you'd like to plug here on air?
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.341]  Website.
[01:35:11.161 --> 01:35:12.702]  I'm not too good on websites.
[01:35:12.842 --> 01:35:14.984]  I go there, but not really stuffy.
[01:35:15.304 --> 01:35:15.864]  Sure, sure.
[01:35:16.225 --> 01:35:21.288]  Folks can find the book just by typing your name into a search engine.
[01:35:21.428 --> 01:35:26.771]  I use Google a lot for finding out something about whoever I might be wanting to do something about.
[01:35:27.412 --> 01:35:31.214]  Sure, so folks can just type in Ralph Steadman into a search engine.
[01:35:31.595 --> 01:35:36.458]  Up on InfoWars.com we have direct links to your publisher and to Amazon where folks can get the new book.
[01:35:36.918 --> 01:35:39.681]  Yeah, and also, ralphstedman.com.
[01:35:39.841 --> 01:35:41.642]  It's easy.
[01:35:41.662 --> 01:35:42.904]  It's straight there.
[01:35:43.184 --> 01:35:44.705]  ralphstedman.com.
[01:35:44.745 --> 01:35:46.307]  Yes, we'll link to that right now, folks.
[01:35:46.367 --> 01:35:50.090]  If you missed the spelling of that, you can go to infowares.com and find that.
[01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:51.892]  I want to play a clip of Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:59.999]  This is from the film Loose Change, a clip from Hunter S. Thompson shortly before, well, right after 9-11, a few years before he died.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.961]  At his home, which you do believe is suicide.
[01:36:02.981 --> 01:36:12.965]  We'll talk about that in a moment, but I want to play a minute and a half clip of him talking about 9-11 and talking to some of his other associates when he was beginning to write and say he believed that there was a cover-up.
[01:36:13.225 --> 01:36:19.328]  I want to get your take on that, but here's a clip of your late colleague and friend Hunter S. Thompson on Australian radio.
[01:36:21.445 --> 01:36:29.927]  The first question I have is basically to get from you a sense of how you would rate the American media in their coverage of the events of the attack last September.
[01:36:30.247 --> 01:36:30.988]  Well, let's see.
[01:36:31.968 --> 01:36:34.128]  Shamefully is a word that comes to mind.
[01:36:34.248 --> 01:36:42.471]  But overall, the American journalism was cowed and intimidated by this massive flag-sucking, this patriotic orgy.
[01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:45.592]  You know, if you criticize the President, it's unpatriotic.
[01:36:45.652 --> 01:36:47.312]  If there's something wrong with you, you may be a terrorist.
[01:36:47.912 --> 01:36:52.073]  So, in that sense, Hunter S. Thompson, there's not enough room for dissenting voices?
[01:36:52.354 --> 01:36:54.674]  Well, there's plenty of room.
[01:36:54.914 --> 01:36:56.115]  People are willing to take the risk.
[01:36:56.735 --> 01:37:01.756]  It's just sort of a herd mentality, a lending-like mentality.
[01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:06.458]  If you don't go with the flow, you're anti-American, therefore a suspect.
[01:37:07.178 --> 01:37:10.939]  You sort of wonder when something like that happens, well, who stands to benefit?
[01:37:11.099 --> 01:37:13.400]  Who has the opportunity and the motive?
[01:37:14.116 --> 01:37:15.517]  You just gotta look at these basic things.
[01:37:15.917 --> 01:37:19.939]  I don't assume that I know the truth about what, uh, went on that day.
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:29.105]  And, yeah, I'm just looking around and looking for, well, who had the motives, who had the opportunity, who had the, uh, equipment, who had the, uh, had the will.
[01:37:29.485 --> 01:37:33.907]  I've spent enough time on the inside of, well, the White House and the, you know, campaigns.
[01:37:34.208 --> 01:37:41.612]  I've known enough of the people who do these things to know that the public version of the news, whatever the event, is never right with them.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.881]  These people I think are willing to take that even further.
[01:37:48.721 --> 01:38:07.064]  Alright, again a clip from the film Loose Chains using a clip from a radio interview he did and then I talked to, in fact I need to pull those stories, I talked to a Canadian reporter, another American reporter that talked to Mr. Thompson shortly before he committed suicide or some believe was killed, but you talked to his son and you believe he did commit suicide.
[01:38:07.104 --> 01:38:11.245]  He talked quite a bit about it so we have to think it probably was suicide, but we
[01:38:11.826 --> 01:38:14.607]  We'll probably never know exactly, but you believe he did.
[01:38:15.307 --> 01:38:25.551]  Speaking about 9-11, before he died, he did tell reporters I've talked to that he believed there were bombs in the buildings and that it was probably an inside job or some type of involvement.
[01:38:26.231 --> 01:38:29.873]  Can you elaborate on that or tell us what he told you, Mr. Steadman?
[01:38:30.753 --> 01:38:34.474]  Well, he never told me any of those things, and I don't think he really knew.
[01:38:34.755 --> 01:38:40.617]  But being said, he was lately paranoid about his whole country.
[01:38:41.798 --> 01:38:43.759]  Seriously, falling to pieces.
[01:38:45.741 --> 01:39:04.214]  He, as I just heard that I've heard that tape before, but he seems to me seems to me that he was feeling broken by the actual impossibility of being able to change anything, that things were on a downward path.
[01:39:04.954 --> 01:39:10.258]  And they see they never America's never really had a foreign policy, as I was saying, and, and you lived
[01:39:11.058 --> 01:39:16.842]  Quite comfortably within your fractal shores, you know, that was America and that was the world.
[01:39:17.442 --> 01:39:29.371]  Outside of America, there really wasn't anything that connected you wholeheartedly, except that the only thing I can think of is how much influence you imparted to the world.
[01:39:29.411 --> 01:39:37.036]  You know, you gave us all sorts of music, all sorts of new weapons,
[01:39:37.745 --> 01:39:43.529]  You know, lots of things of that kind, and finance corrupt regimes.
[01:39:44.409 --> 01:39:56.077]  And it just seems that that has always been going on, but they talk, they behave as though or pretend there is nothing happening, that everything is okay.
[01:39:56.437 --> 01:40:01.680]  And that sound bites on a television set, which we just talked about going throughout the land.
[01:40:03.902 --> 01:40:04.362]  People just
[01:40:05.146 --> 01:40:05.826]  Oh, that's OK.
[01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:06.487]  That's what's happened.
[01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:06.787]  I see.
[01:40:06.807 --> 01:40:07.227]  That's fine.
[01:40:07.367 --> 01:40:07.727]  Don't worry.
[01:40:07.747 --> 01:40:08.667]  Everything's OK.
[01:40:08.727 --> 01:40:12.649]  It doesn't matter about spying.
[01:40:13.409 --> 01:40:19.011]  And the other thing you mentioned, which I absolutely find the most unforgivable thing of all, is torture.
[01:40:19.311 --> 01:40:22.713]  That they can even discuss torture as a possibility.
[01:40:22.953 --> 01:40:31.976]  Have you seen or read about the Gonzales and John E. Mimos where they say they can torture someone unto death and if they don't kill them on purpose it's not torture?
[01:40:31.996 --> 01:40:34.317]  And then they expand it and say they can crush children's
[01:40:35.317 --> 01:40:37.658]  Private parts with pliers in front of their parents?
[01:40:38.378 --> 01:40:41.858]  I have heard, and it doesn't surprise me.
[01:40:42.138 --> 01:40:53.061]  It shocks me to the stage where I feel it is the one serious crime that I would have outlawed as unthinkable in any government.
[01:40:53.361 --> 01:40:58.842]  And if any government even talks about it, it ought to be rejected.
[01:40:58.862 --> 01:41:03.943]  Not out of hand, but the government should sacrifice their right to be governors.
[01:41:05.222 --> 01:41:09.566]  I mean, it just seems to me that torture is unforgivable, totally unforgivable.
[01:41:09.746 --> 01:41:18.693]  It's this premeditated idea of causing pain, ostensibly to extract information.
[01:41:18.713 --> 01:41:22.457]  Well, if it has to be that way, then the information is not worth it anyway.
[01:41:23.357 --> 01:41:25.179]  But the thing itself, it's so hideous.
[01:41:25.739 --> 01:41:29.763]  I mean, it's just like, I guess as kids we'd pull
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.120]  Well, did we?
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:31.501]  I didn't.
[01:41:31.741 --> 01:41:35.884]  But there's no one that people pull wings off flies and things of that kind.
[01:41:35.904 --> 01:41:39.127]  But it's just the it's unthinkable.
[01:41:39.607 --> 01:41:41.268]  And it's one of our basic rights.
[01:41:42.009 --> 01:41:47.633]  There are 2020 rights of the Human Declaration of Human Independence.
[01:41:47.713 --> 01:41:49.455]  That was Eleanor Roosevelt 1948.
[01:41:49.555 --> 01:41:54.979]  I think it's number 12 that states that is completely outlawed.
[01:41:55.459 --> 01:41:58.882]  Torture is something if this government
[01:41:59.784 --> 01:42:04.508]  Is using it in any form whatsoever, as far as I'm concerned, it cancels them out as government.
[01:42:05.348 --> 01:42:09.591]  I mean, to be governed by people who are even contemplating such things is the most idiotic thing.
[01:42:09.872 --> 01:42:10.312]  Well, you're right.
[01:42:10.332 --> 01:42:15.556]  They also play this delusional game of saying, well, if we don't call it torture, it's not torture.
[01:42:16.337 --> 01:42:18.798]  Well, I mean, that insults our intelligence.
[01:42:19.058 --> 01:42:20.158]  Yeah.
[01:42:20.438 --> 01:42:27.760]  And John Yoo, who was the underling of... I mean, these memos were used by the military to implement this, and we know the children were tortured in front of their parents.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.421]  That's, you know, now mainstream news.
[01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:34.122]  A federal judge has ordered they have to release the photos of them raping children and women in front of their families.
[01:42:34.722 --> 01:42:42.789]  I mean, this is real, folks, not just the first stuff we saw from CBS, people beating to death and dogs attacking people, and Rush Limbaugh just called it blowing off steam, having fun.
[01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:47.533]  Even the Nazis were smart enough and had enough shame to hide it.
[01:42:47.854 --> 01:42:58.503]  This is one of the first times, really, since Caligula, or since Nero, or since the Byzantines after them, where they just openly flaunted, and then we have the quote in the New York Times,
[01:42:59.387 --> 01:43:08.031]  Well, there was also Abu Ghraib, which, in fact, was one of the most shameful things we saw, and it was carried out in the name of some kind of democratic attempt
[01:43:29.079 --> 01:43:40.644]  To bring self-government to Iraq, to make people responsible for their own country, for their own way of running things.
[01:43:41.224 --> 01:43:49.907]  But there were these pictures of soldiers doing such hideous things, and then photographing it and laughing about it.
[01:43:50.347 --> 01:43:54.029]  But then it turns out exactly what they were doing was written in memos to them,
[01:43:55.176 --> 01:44:04.646]  And in the White House, John, you was at a CFR meeting in Chicago, and he got confronted by Professor Castle, and they recorded it, and John, he said, did you write, you can torture children sexually?
[01:44:04.686 --> 01:44:06.789]  And John, you said, yes, we can do that.
[01:44:06.949 --> 01:44:08.651]  This is outrageous.
[01:44:08.711 --> 01:44:09.492]  In fact, we have that.
[01:44:09.532 --> 01:44:12.175]  Well, doesn't that make, surely, doesn't that cancel out your government?
[01:44:12.455 --> 01:44:15.519]  And isn't it time that there was a kind of revolution?
[01:44:15.539 --> 01:44:17.581]  Yeah, it's totally, the government's totally illegitimate.
[01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:22.887]  Let me read from page 383 of your new book, The Joke's Over, by Ralph Steadman.
[01:44:23.207 --> 01:44:24.949]  Memo to the sports desk, Paris 2006.
[01:44:24.989 --> 01:44:25.449]  Dear Hunter,
[01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:31.672]  It is over a year since you set the scene for your strangely planned suicide.
[01:44:31.712 --> 01:44:39.954]  The messages that I had received from you up to the Bush-Kerry election of 2004 were infected by a dismal undertone.
[01:44:40.034 --> 01:44:57.058]  Quote, if Bush wins, you said, the planet is doomed, the Halliburton Corporation will rule with an army of obedient geeks who will transform America into a land fit for the religious freaks, informers, fascists, legislators, greed heads, an obscene defense budget against the terrorists, in quotes,
[01:44:57.618 --> 01:45:04.563]  And the defense for the preemptive action against Iran and the ambition to remain the most dominant power on earth by whatever means.
[01:45:04.943 --> 01:45:12.548]  And it goes on to say that, you know, he talks about, you talk about how basically we're going to be in martial law here if that happened.
[01:45:12.968 --> 01:45:14.389]  But I don't think it even mattered to begin with.
[01:45:14.429 --> 01:45:16.270]  They owned Kerry just like they owned Bush.
[01:45:16.690 --> 01:45:21.373]  And that whole thing was rigged, not just rigged in Ohio, but Kerry clearly took a dive.
[01:45:21.434 --> 01:45:26.537]  I mean, elaborate, because everything you and he were saying has now happened.
[01:45:27.277 --> 01:45:30.960]  And we are now witnessing open declaration of dictatorship.
[01:45:32.381 --> 01:45:54.015]  Well, isn't it obvious that you're going to witness that with a man like George Bush in complete control with advisors on either side of him, Cheney and Rumsfeld, who have had a lifetime of learning every covert trick that is known and then applying it again in a
[01:45:55.023 --> 01:46:03.619]  In a country where it seems to me that republicanism is about fundamentalism.
[01:46:03.959 --> 01:46:06.404]  Fundamentalism is about stupidity.
[01:46:07.716 --> 01:46:12.880]  Well, they use well-meaning Christians, basically, and just manipulate them.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:21.746]  I mean, it's been in even the New York Republican Post and been in the San Francisco Chronicle that at, you know, Bohemian Grove they bus in, quote, male porn stars to service them.
[01:46:21.766 --> 01:46:28.651]  There's tons of midnight visits of the gay porn stars and mainstream reports of underage stuff going on.
[01:46:28.691 --> 01:46:32.513]  In fact, Hunter had been talking to reporters about doing a report about that.
[01:46:32.653 --> 01:46:36.096]  Did he ever talk to you about how the Republican White House was
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:40.461]  Was he obsessed with shipping in men?
[01:46:41.861 --> 01:46:47.002]  He often talked, in a paranoid way, about things of that sort happening.
[01:46:47.342 --> 01:46:50.782]  In fact, even involving George Bush himself.
[01:46:51.402 --> 01:47:04.045]  We found, this is extraordinary, he was in a party in Texas and he came across George Bush lying, stoned out of his head, in a bathtub.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:15.222]  Well, I hope he's having a good time, but he since put everything like that behind him and became a bound guard.
[01:47:15.522 --> 01:47:18.622]  You're saying Hunter S. Thompson founding stone in the background?
[01:47:18.642 --> 01:47:20.043]  Yeah, Hunter S. Thompson founded it.
[01:47:20.103 --> 01:47:20.683]  He told me that.
[01:47:21.043 --> 01:47:24.123]  I know a whole bunch of people here in town partied pretty hard with Lord Bush.
[01:47:24.484 --> 01:47:36.266]  Yeah, but now it's not... To party hard is one thing, but to use your political party to
[01:47:37.304 --> 01:47:57.134]  Put into place anything you wish to put into place that seems to suit what you consider to be the most desirable way of living and driving other people to become terrorists almost.
[01:47:58.181 --> 01:48:02.303]  That's what the Pentagon Plan P-2-O-G called for, is actually to stimulate terror attacks.
[01:48:03.124 --> 01:48:09.347]  Can you speak more, though, to what Thompson told you privately about Bush and his penchant for men?
[01:48:11.268 --> 01:48:27.016]  Just that, in fact, there were always in Hunter's conversations examples of many covert sort of
[01:48:27.546 --> 01:48:52.442]  Party-like, I mean parties, parties, not party politics, but things that were, I was led to believe, were peculiar to to those in government, that there was a almost an impossible way of living life that was
[01:48:54.637 --> 01:48:59.804]  Yeah, it's a prerequisite that these guys are ultra-decadent.
[01:48:59.884 --> 01:49:02.708]  You join our way and we'll make you.
[01:49:02.728 --> 01:49:03.650]  You'll be okay.
[01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:09.979]  You'll become well-off and enjoy everything provided you stay in our
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.921]  Ballpark, our way of doing things.
[01:49:13.001 --> 01:49:16.483]  So basically there are rites and passages to join the neocons?
[01:49:16.643 --> 01:49:21.225]  Yes, rather like there would be in the Masonic Lodge, you know, sort of the same kind of thing.
[01:49:21.245 --> 01:49:26.387]  So Hunter talked a lot about weird stuff, not just that, but any black hoods or anything?
[01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:34.951]  That he went to any... I should think the ones that he went to would have Hell's Angels around them, and he got well into that.
[01:49:35.811 --> 01:49:36.432]  Enjoyed that.
[01:49:37.293 --> 01:49:39.436]  So he did know about all these things.
[01:49:39.577 --> 01:49:40.798]  So just total debauchery?
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:42.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:42.581 --> 01:49:43.402]  In a sense, yes.
[01:49:43.462 --> 01:49:49.291]  But I don't think that Hunter would have done that other daily.
[01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:50.312]  We've got to break.
[01:49:50.332 --> 01:49:51.253]  We've got to break again, sir.
[01:49:51.294 --> 01:49:51.894]  Sorry to stop you.
[01:49:51.914 --> 01:49:52.135]  Here we go.
[01:49:56.773 --> 01:49:59.956]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.296 --> 01:50:02.238]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.598 --> 01:50:10.264]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.924 --> 01:50:17.990]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:25.296]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:50:25.754 --> 01:50:29.795]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.115 --> 01:50:33.596]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.076 --> 01:50:35.977]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.337 --> 01:50:40.258]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.314 --> 01:50:58.395]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.455 --> 01:51:05.758]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.918 --> 01:51:14.360]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine,
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.121]  We're good to go!

[01:53:02.881 --> 01:53:04.762]  Welcome back!
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:33.622]  We're going to keep Ralph Steadman five minutes into the next hour with us and we've got Frank Morales.
[01:53:33.642 --> 01:53:35.283]  We'll try to take your calls in that third hour.
[01:53:35.303 --> 01:53:40.745]  I want to run through the details, the actual bill itself, making Bush a dictator.
[01:53:41.306 --> 01:53:48.329]  Ralph Steadman, I snuck into Bohemian Grove, the first and only person, up until that time in 2000, now a worker, in 2005 shot more video.
[01:53:48.389 --> 01:53:50.070]  I'm going to put that in the film, The Order of Death.
[01:53:50.955 --> 01:53:56.376]  And it's all these old men dressed up in their little hoods doing their little ritual and it gets a lot wilder.
[01:53:57.136 --> 01:54:00.897]  Were you aware or did Hunter S. Thompson ever tell you anything about that?
[01:54:01.997 --> 01:54:03.498]  Nope, he didn't tell me anything about that.
[01:54:03.658 --> 01:54:04.478]  He didn't get into that.
[01:54:04.518 --> 01:54:09.319]  I think he almost assumed that I would know about things like that because I've drawn things like that.
[01:54:09.799 --> 01:54:14.440]  It's not that I'm attracted to it so much as...
[01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:21.372]  I feel goosebumps about it sometimes when I think of what they can get.
[01:54:21.392 --> 01:54:43.361]  I mean, one of my favorite films is To Kill a Mockingbird, you know, as a film that shows you just what people get capable of when they get into a sort of a screaming sort of... I can't think of the word now, for God's sake, but it is in fact something that people become frantic
[01:54:44.904 --> 01:54:54.608]  And I think, unfortunately, the news whips people up into a kind of frenzy and their selection is moving people up into a kind of frenzy.
[01:54:54.888 --> 01:54:58.290]  But is there anything real in it or is it just
[01:54:59.019 --> 01:55:01.640]  Accusation and counter-accusation.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:02.561]  Take Skull and Bones.
[01:55:02.741 --> 01:55:03.981]  I talked about that a decade ago.
[01:55:04.001 --> 01:55:04.561]  I was a kook.
[01:55:05.122 --> 01:55:09.424]  Then Peter Jennings played clips of mock human sacrifices and said it's just fine.
[01:55:09.984 --> 01:55:16.247]  Elites throughout history get very decadent and they always end up, for some reason, running around devil-worshipping and stabbing people.
[01:55:16.387 --> 01:55:21.509]  My point is, in your travels, how much of the edge of that did you graze?
[01:55:22.569 --> 01:55:23.870]  I think mostly cock-fighting.
[01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:26.671]  Some of that, the people get into that, that's bad enough.
[01:55:28.976 --> 01:55:34.538]  I've never witnessed a human sacrifice of any kind.
[01:55:34.998 --> 01:55:39.480]  Well, I'm not saying a human sacrifice, but just, you know, eyes wide shut stuff.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.760]  I mean, did you ever hear about that or know about that?
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:44.681]  Yeah, I do know about that.
[01:55:45.542 --> 01:55:47.402]  You ever seen anything like that?
[01:55:47.422 --> 01:55:47.462]  No.
[01:55:49.023 --> 01:55:50.923]  No, I have never seen anything like that.
[01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:58.466]  Listen, I'm an innocent little... No, I know, but I mean, did you ever hear or see anything like that from all your contacts?
[01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:06.352]  Um, not that I would remember now or have I put it out of my mind.
[01:56:06.512 --> 01:56:07.112]  That's the point.
[01:56:07.332 --> 01:56:07.773]  I understand.
[01:56:07.793 --> 01:56:09.093]  This is a very dangerous subject.
[01:56:09.193 --> 01:56:15.015]  Yeah, I think I put out my mind things that I think quite possibly happened.
[01:56:16.535 --> 01:56:17.015]  I understand.
[01:56:17.456 --> 01:56:20.837]  I mean, I was I was I knew John McCarthy.
[01:56:23.898 --> 01:56:28.239]  He was he was put into a Lebanese jail, kept there for five years.
[01:56:29.598 --> 01:56:42.529]  There's a man called William Samson who has written a book about being taken off the street in Saudi Arabia and kept for three years in solitary confinement.
[01:56:43.130 --> 01:56:46.252]  What do you think of Eyes Wide Shut?
[01:56:47.493 --> 01:56:50.556]  I think it's a kind of film that you make more of.
[01:56:51.197 --> 01:56:52.718]  Those sort of films are
[01:56:54.656 --> 01:56:55.297]  Yes, we're good.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:14.002]  And it was about the Scopes trial, the Scopes Monkey trial, and the teaching of Darwin.
[01:57:14.503 --> 01:57:21.806]  You can't teach Darwin in school, for God's sake, you know, where are you as a country when you cannot remain that open?
[01:57:22.186 --> 01:57:23.106]  We've got a break, sir.
[01:57:23.166 --> 01:57:23.527]  Stay there.
[01:57:23.647 --> 01:57:26.568]  One minute break, or 70 seconds to be precise.
[01:57:26.808 --> 01:57:28.329]  We'll come back with a final segment with you.
[01:57:28.749 --> 01:57:30.109]  The book is The Joke's Over.
[01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:31.350]  Ralph Steadman's our guest.
[01:57:33.317 --> 01:57:38.161]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.201 --> 01:57:38.641]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.681 --> 01:57:39.582]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.802 --> 01:57:42.444]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:42.484 --> 01:57:45.827]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.005 --> 01:57:56.866]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.886 --> 01:58:01.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.730 --> 01:58:05.854]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.515 --> 01:58:15.022]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us in the third hour now of this live Thursday edition, second day of November 2006.
[01:58:17.284 --> 01:58:22.228]  We'll be joined by Frank Morales covering the open declaration of martial law against the American people in the next segment.
[01:58:22.288 --> 01:58:22.909]  Your calls will
[01:58:23.735 --> 01:58:25.436]  Be available as well, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:25.676 --> 01:58:34.099]  Final segment with Ralph Steadman, the British cartoonist and caricaturist, also written quite a few powerful books.
[01:58:36.239 --> 01:58:48.484]  He's lived a lot, seen a lot, been on the inside of a lot of things, and as you heard him, a little too dangerous to talk about the eyes wide shut type stuff here on air, but that's what our loving leader, our Christian conservative leaders are into.
[01:58:48.504 --> 01:58:49.644]  It's just such a joke.
[01:58:50.197 --> 01:58:55.998]  In the last four minutes we've got left, sir, any other key points or issues or things you'd like to impart to this audience?
[01:58:56.018 --> 01:59:02.299]  There's always one thing you could say, is never interrupt your enemy whilst they're making a mistake.
[01:59:03.979 --> 01:59:05.460]  And that's what's happening right now.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:08.200]  So maybe, I don't know, give them enough rope.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:11.501]  So you're saying make a dictator act like a dictator?
[01:59:11.801 --> 01:59:12.061]  Yeah.
[01:59:12.781 --> 01:59:19.362]  And hope that there are people still in America, and the rest of the world I hope, who will
[01:59:22.847 --> 01:59:26.029]  Have you ever thought it could be a revolution again?
[01:59:26.109 --> 01:59:30.092]  After you've had your first revolution, you've got to kick the English out.
[01:59:30.233 --> 01:59:32.514]  Now it's time to kick some of your own guys out.
[01:59:32.935 --> 01:59:35.617]  It's really, really bad to watch.
[01:59:36.297 --> 01:59:42.382]  I mean, even to see his face on television and to hear him speak about terrorists.
[01:59:42.442 --> 01:59:43.183]  I don't know what he calls them.
[01:59:43.584 --> 01:59:45.204]  But he's not that kind of way of speaking.
[01:59:45.485 --> 01:59:46.605]  What do you see in the future?
[01:59:46.625 --> 01:59:55.548]  I mean, I see a massive awakening taking place across political lines, across cultural lines, worldwide, but I see the establishment moving to try to block that.
[01:59:56.208 --> 02:00:10.272]  I know they're trying to stop it, but they're trying to make people just get occupied, preoccupied by silly things, so that they can continue to exercise any powers that they feel necessary
[02:00:10.888 --> 02:00:13.870]  To fulfill some sick man's dream, actually.
[02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:19.693]  I mean, this might be the second part of one sick man's dream.
[02:00:20.073 --> 02:00:35.161]  And he has enough cohorts with him who would help him achieve his dream whilst in office to really bring this country to its knees in as much as
[02:00:36.614 --> 02:00:42.817]  Um, it will be run by business, governed by business, and there will be no such thing as democracy.
[02:00:43.137 --> 02:00:56.364]  Isn't George Bush surrounded by a coterie, literally, of dark generals and dark magicians whose ether is death and destruction and power and power for power's sake, always pressing on the nerve of power, Winston?
[02:00:57.045 --> 02:01:01.427]  I think it was hopefully to be a kind of power used
[02:01:02.282 --> 02:01:03.143]  Um, accurately.
[02:01:03.443 --> 02:01:10.249]  But in fact, it's become a power that's getting used and spreading almost, uh, without control.
[02:01:10.489 --> 02:01:19.176]  Well, that is the problem of the dictatorship is all of the servants and minions, uh, in office or in positions of power, the designates set up their own little petty fiefdoms.
[02:01:19.717 --> 02:01:23.140]  Yeah, that's exactly what's going to perhaps happen just now.
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:28.264]  And I think it won't be long before, I think by 1010, we'll have a, we'll have a real
[02:01:28.931 --> 02:01:34.472]  A real sense of police state tactics used on ordinary folk.
[02:01:34.672 --> 02:01:37.153]  Well, no one can say that we're not living in interesting times.
[02:01:37.873 --> 02:01:39.994]  Well, you could say that, but it could be hideous times.
[02:01:40.314 --> 02:01:47.576]  I mean, um, Katrina and the terrible, terrible way that was treated.
[02:01:48.476 --> 02:01:57.618]  That in itself can show you just how self-selfish people are, how disgusting, when they have all the power at their disposal
[02:01:58.041 --> 02:02:09.054]  To help those people to go in and to have done what he should have done, not leave it and gerrymander around and start blaming other people or going down there.
[02:02:09.975 --> 02:02:16.703]  He has such a mean, smiling Jack kind of face.
[02:02:18.696 --> 02:02:19.717]  It's like a jack-o-lantern.
[02:02:19.917 --> 02:02:24.360]  It's almost like the smiler in Batman, you know?
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:25.561]  The Joker.
[02:02:25.981 --> 02:02:26.741]  The Joker, yeah.
[02:02:26.922 --> 02:02:27.402]  That's the man.
[02:02:27.682 --> 02:02:28.563]  Ralph Steadman's new book.
[02:02:28.583 --> 02:02:29.684]  I think that's who he is.
[02:02:29.744 --> 02:02:30.544]  He is the Joker.
[02:02:30.644 --> 02:02:34.827]  Ralph Steadman's new book, The Joke, is over about Hunter S. Thompson.
[02:02:34.887 --> 02:02:36.168]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:02:36.188 --> 02:02:37.009]  I hope to talk to you again soon.
[02:02:37.029 --> 02:02:37.669]  It's been a pleasure.
[02:02:38.049 --> 02:02:38.970]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:39.390]  You bet.
[02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:39.791]  Take care.
[02:02:40.171 --> 02:02:41.672]  We'll be right back with Frank Morales.
[02:02:41.692 --> 02:02:43.173]  That was an amazing interview, was it not?
[02:02:48.479 --> 02:02:48.959]  It's here!
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:53.943]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.323 --> 02:03:01.989]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:09.714]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.114 --> 02:03:17.019]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.478 --> 02:03:21.520]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:25.502]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.802 --> 02:03:27.723]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.063 --> 02:03:31.985]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:53.515]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[02:04:53.735 --> 02:04:55.556]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[02:04:55.756 --> 02:04:56.337]  That's 1 in 4 adults.
[02:04:57.267 --> 02:05:03.350]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[02:05:48.682 --> 02:05:51.544]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.485 --> 02:05:56.168]  The cliche rings true, it's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[02:05:57.449 --> 02:06:01.313]  Open dictatorship has been set loose upon us.
[02:06:01.333 --> 02:06:04.956]  The question is, will they try to implement all of the new powers they've granted themselves?
[02:06:04.996 --> 02:06:09.220]  The power only granted to dictators by themselves throughout history.
[02:06:10.023 --> 02:06:12.607]  Bush has crossed the Rubicon with his legions.
[02:06:12.687 --> 02:06:13.768]  Will they follow his orders?
[02:06:13.808 --> 02:06:18.475]  Will he concoct some new global crisis as a reason to clamp down at an even greater level?
[02:06:18.495 --> 02:06:22.821]  We're going to be talking to Frank Morales in just a moment and he is just such a great person.
[02:06:22.881 --> 02:06:23.842]  I count him as a friend.
[02:06:23.862 --> 02:06:26.987]  I've gotten to be at several events over the years with him.
[02:06:27.811 --> 02:06:29.152]  His research is flawless.
[02:06:29.713 --> 02:06:34.597]  His dedication to the common person and to justice and liberty is unrivaled.
[02:06:35.357 --> 02:06:38.160]  He's a good person.
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.241]  You can feel that when you're around him.
[02:06:40.261 --> 02:06:43.264]  There's very few people that have that aura.
[02:06:43.744 --> 02:06:45.025]  I dropped the ball a few weeks ago.
[02:06:45.306 --> 02:06:50.650]  I read on air the Army Times crowing that NORTHCOM is now in operational control of the U.S.
[02:06:50.690 --> 02:06:55.634]  as a theater of operations that foreign Canadian and Mexican troops could be used in suppression of populations.
[02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:56.655]  It really happened.
[02:06:58.357 --> 02:07:01.740]  But I mentioned it and kind of glazed over it because I was so busy focusing on H.R.
[02:07:02.141 --> 02:07:04.203]  6166, the Military Commissions Act.
[02:07:04.263 --> 02:07:17.996]  Well, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 has all the pork barrel and hundreds of billions in weapons contracts in it and Halliburton contracts and no-bid contracts.
[02:07:19.035 --> 02:07:25.378]  But the key is in section 10 U.S.C.
[02:07:25.398 --> 02:07:27.739]  331-335 and 18 U.S.C.
[02:07:27.759 --> 02:07:27.739]  1385.
[02:07:27.919 --> 02:07:42.826]  Let me just read some of the great article written last week by the man who we're about to be speaking with, Frank Morales, who I have to add, his wife's another wonderful person, writer for Vanity Fair, best mainstream article we've seen on the 9-11 truth movement, covering loose change a few months ago.
[02:07:44.122 --> 02:07:46.865]  Bush moves towards martial law in a stealth maneuver.
[02:07:46.905 --> 02:07:55.413]  President Bush has signed into law a provision which, according to Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat Vermont, will actually encourage the President to declare federal martial law.
[02:07:55.513 --> 02:08:03.000]  It does so by revising the Insurrection Act, a set of laws that limits the President's ability to deploy troops from the United States.
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.821]  The Insurrection Act, U.S.
[02:08:04.861 --> 02:08:06.522]  Code, Title 10, U.S.C.
[02:08:06.542 --> 02:08:13.247]  331-335 has historically, along with Posse Comitatus, the 1878 Act, 18 U.S.C.
[02:08:13.627 --> 02:08:19.291]  1385, helped to enforce strict prohibitions on military involvement in domestic law enforcement.
[02:08:19.711 --> 02:08:24.414]  With one cloaked swipe of his pen, Bush is seeking to undo these prohibitions.
[02:08:26.613 --> 02:08:35.075]  Public Law 109-364, or the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, H.R.
[02:08:35.095 --> 02:08:51.979]  5122, Section 2, which was signed, or I guess Version 2, which was signed by the Commander-in-Chief on October 17, 2006, in a private Oval Office ceremony, allows the President to declare a public emergency in station groups anywhere in America and take control of state-based National Guard units without the consent
[02:08:54.801 --> 02:09:07.050]  President Bush seized the unprecedented power on the very same day that he signed the equally odious Military Commissions Act of 2006.
[02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:10.572]  In a sense, the two laws complement one another.
[02:09:10.853 --> 02:09:12.093]  Well, they do in every sense of the way.
[02:09:12.634 --> 02:09:15.196]  One allows for torture and detention abroad, including U.S.
[02:09:15.236 --> 02:09:16.777]  citizens, while the other seeks to enforce
[02:09:17.509 --> 02:09:21.612]  Acquiescence at home, preparing to order the military out of the streets of America.
[02:09:21.672 --> 02:09:26.436]  Remember, the term for putting an area under military law enforcement control is precise.
[02:09:26.476 --> 02:09:28.257]  The term is martial law.
[02:09:28.698 --> 02:09:42.508]  Section 1076 of the Massive Authorization Act, which grants the Pentagon another 500 plus billion for its ill-advised adventures, is entitled, Use of Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies, Section 333, Major Public Emergencies, Infrastructure,
[02:09:43.630 --> 02:10:06.666]  Interference with the state and federal law states that the president may employ the armed forces, including the National Guard in federal service, and restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack, or incident, just incident, or other condition in the state or possession, so other incident, anything,
[02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.147]  Of the United States.
[02:10:08.628 --> 02:10:09.268]  Or possession.
[02:10:09.529 --> 02:10:27.447]  The President determines that domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities or state or possession are incapable or quote refuse or fail in maintaining public order in order to suppress in any state an insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy.
[02:10:28.028 --> 02:10:29.189]  And this is dictatorship.
[02:10:30.612 --> 02:10:35.256]  So he is announcing the fewer powers that Hitler announced after the Reichstag fire of 1933.
[02:10:35.577 --> 02:10:42.203]  He is now perfecting those powers and presidents before him, again these are puppets for the big banks, the globalists,
[02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:47.265]  Have prepared and set all these pieces up and now it's almost complete.
[02:10:47.786 --> 02:10:51.169]  Now the question is, will they be able to implement through the crisis they create?
[02:10:51.609 --> 02:10:55.012]  Will we break the tool of state-sponsored terror in front of their eyes?
[02:10:55.593 --> 02:10:58.455]  As Webster Tarpley has said, we have done that to a great extent.
[02:10:59.196 --> 02:11:01.999]  84% believing we're being lied to about 9-11.
[02:11:02.379 --> 02:11:05.782]  84% giving a bad approval rating, not agreeing with Congress.
[02:11:05.802 --> 02:11:07.744]  12% approval rating of Cheney.
[02:11:08.547 --> 02:11:11.170]  The good news is they acted like a dictator.
[02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:13.753]  They moved and now they've woken the people up.
[02:11:13.773 --> 02:11:14.734]  The people are awake.
[02:11:15.194 --> 02:11:19.319]  The question is, will they move to counter this threat?
[02:11:19.799 --> 02:11:23.643]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's not just Frank Morales or Alex Jones.
[02:11:23.884 --> 02:11:25.726]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[02:11:26.346 --> 02:11:30.571]  I want to preface all of this with the facts here before he gives us his great perspective.
[02:11:31.632 --> 02:11:34.593]  Even people like Bob Woodward are saying Bush is becoming a dictator.
[02:11:34.953 --> 02:11:36.914]  All the constitutional scholars are saying this.
[02:11:37.454 --> 02:11:40.715]  A lot of top CIA analysts, retired, are coming on the air.
[02:11:40.795 --> 02:11:42.176]  Big Republicans are saying this.
[02:11:42.956 --> 02:11:48.478]  Mr. Steele, Bill Christensen, many others are saying this.
[02:11:49.258 --> 02:11:50.138]  And it's here.
[02:11:50.238 --> 02:11:50.759]  It's upon us.
[02:11:50.799 --> 02:11:51.599]  This is not a joke.
[02:11:51.639 --> 02:11:54.240]  We must recognize it for what it is.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:57.461]  Frank Morales, thank you for holding for four minutes while I went through that.
[02:11:57.801 --> 02:11:58.661]  No problem, Alex.
[02:11:58.821 --> 02:12:00.462]  It's good to hear your voice again.
[02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:02.229]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:04.110]  You know, I was impressed by your church.
[02:12:04.150 --> 02:12:06.811]  It's a beautiful old church there in Manhattan.
[02:12:06.831 --> 02:12:10.572]  For our New York listeners that want to be members of your church, first off, tell us about your church.
[02:12:11.392 --> 02:12:11.912]  Well, St.
[02:12:11.932 --> 02:12:21.115]  Mark's has got a long history of, you know, both being active in the arts as well as being sensitive to the needs of political activists.
[02:12:21.155 --> 02:12:22.255]  So we provide space
[02:12:23.166 --> 02:12:50.798]  and sponsorship to uh... you know to groups that are attempting to uh... you know uh... fight back uh... that this uh... this new world order you know this uh... military dictatorship that is uh... you know as you pointed out uh... it's right in front of us so what we do what we do our part and anytime uh... people who are coming through new york city people feel free to look at that and come by and uh... you know will will treat you right well should support you are frank
[02:12:52.235 --> 02:12:58.190]  Again, you're one of the few people who got it right from the start because we're just studying the same source documents.
[02:12:58.849 --> 02:13:02.852]  When I was with you in 2004 at the Project Sensory Awards, when I was with you this September in New York.
[02:13:03.392 --> 02:13:04.773]  I mean, I don't like being right.
[02:13:04.813 --> 02:13:05.894]  I know you don't like being right.
[02:13:05.954 --> 02:13:08.175]  Exactly what we said would happen is now unfolding.
[02:13:08.555 --> 02:13:09.896]  It's clear they're going for broke.
[02:13:10.657 --> 02:13:23.225]  Elaborate on what we're facing and what this new military funding act does in tandem, in train, in truck, with HR 6166 and the Military Commissions Act.
[02:13:24.065 --> 02:13:50.596]  Yeah, well, for a number of years now, the Pentagon in cahoots with its corporate backers has created an apparatus to repress our ability to dissent, repress our ability to defend ourselves against the kind of martial law tactics that we're beginning to see being put into place.
[02:13:52.009 --> 02:14:02.833]  It started way back when, when Garden Plot was retooled, Garden Plot being the Department of Defense Civil Disturbance Plan, was taken in by NORTHCOM.
[02:14:02.853 --> 02:14:17.878]  The setting up of NORTHCOM is an unprecedented domestic military command, and of course 9-11, this false flag terrorist operation to rationalize and to create a panic culture so they could get away with this stuff.
[02:14:18.842 --> 02:14:27.907]  It's very clear that they anticipated reaction to the agenda that they had projected for themselves into the future.
[02:14:27.947 --> 02:14:35.071]  They obviously are aware what they were going to attempt to do in terms of their world domination project and so on and so forth.
[02:14:35.531 --> 02:14:41.835]  They estimated quite correctly that there would be reaction on the part of the American people.
[02:14:42.495 --> 02:14:46.137]  And so it's logical in a sense that they would have been moving
[02:14:46.676 --> 02:14:50.800]  Kind of in tandem with their global maneuvers to repress us at home.
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:53.543]  The war abroad implies a war at home.
[02:14:53.623 --> 02:14:56.346]  It's part of the same dialectic, the same pathology.
[02:14:56.906 --> 02:15:07.437]  So what we're seeing now are kind of the finishing touches, so to speak, in terms of the ability now of Bush, who anticipates local reaction
[02:15:08.527 --> 02:15:12.730]  Within the military, the National Guard units... And that's the key point.
[02:15:12.770 --> 02:15:16.972]  They're openly saying they know they're going to do something that's going to cause massive resistance.
[02:15:17.853 --> 02:15:19.814]  They know that they've woken the public up.
[02:15:20.194 --> 02:15:20.714]  Exactly.
[02:15:21.015 --> 02:15:28.259]  So, you know, I think if we just boil it down to that kind of simple way of understanding it, they know that we're not stupid.
[02:15:29.019 --> 02:15:30.020]  So what are they going to do?
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:37.064]  They're going to do what comes natural to them, which is to try to tool up, so to speak, for the reaction that's coming and that's been growing.
[02:15:37.586 --> 02:15:44.349]  The awareness that's been growing through, you know, shows what you've been doing is letting people know, and so on.
[02:15:44.409 --> 02:15:50.431]  So, I think at this point now we have our work cut out for us, but it's certainly not insurmountable.
[02:15:50.892 --> 02:15:56.294]  They already repeal Section 1076, which is the section that you were quoting from.
[02:15:56.314 --> 02:16:01.436]  There's already groups around the country that are moving towards repealing this, even though
[02:16:02.046 --> 02:16:07.267]  As you note, this story has been in no mainstream media at all.
[02:16:07.888 --> 02:16:26.932]  The fact that they've rewritten the Insurrection Act, virtually repealed posse comitatus, and are collapsing the military into the police, and allowing the executive, Bush, to single-handedly station troops anywhere he sees fit, against the objections of local governors.
[02:16:26.952 --> 02:16:28.793]  You know, the Governors Association voted
[02:16:30.301 --> 02:16:34.884]  51 to zip or whatever, you know, against this when they were proposing this.
[02:16:35.225 --> 02:16:36.686]  The governors have already spoken.
[02:16:37.106 --> 02:16:42.250]  The Army Times had a piece a while back where they spoke out against it.
[02:16:42.650 --> 02:16:44.652]  The Air Force, the same thing.
[02:16:44.972 --> 02:16:46.754]  Journal of the Air Force Association.
[02:16:47.054 --> 02:16:52.978]  Oh, listen, all, exactly, all the top jag including a bunch of Republicans are saying this is dictatorship.
[02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:55.200]  It's not just Frank Morales and Alex Jones.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.041]  Precisely.
[02:16:56.381 --> 02:16:57.462]  So I think that what that
[02:16:58.149 --> 02:17:12.773]  should point out to people is that there's a sizable base of opposition to this and what we need to do now, aside from delineating the fact of what they're doing, which I think we've been doing quite effectively, is to now begin to figure out strategies that we can counter this.
[02:17:12.833 --> 02:17:24.297]  And one of the ways groups have been moving to repeal this section, I think that we need to deal with recodifying posse comitatus type legislation on the local level.
[02:17:25.117 --> 02:17:33.600]  In other words, you know, local towns and cities and others move towards creating legislation that clearly, you know, protects their own guard.
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:34.921]  Stay there, Frank Morales.
[02:17:34.941 --> 02:17:35.521]  We've got a break.
[02:17:35.541 --> 02:17:37.102]  We'll be back in just a few short minutes.
[02:17:37.142 --> 02:17:37.942]  Please continue.
[02:17:38.442 --> 02:17:42.724]  This is so important, a strategy to overturn this, to preempt this coup.
[02:17:46.010 --> 02:17:47.172]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[02:17:47.212 --> 02:17:48.173]  Today is November 2nd, 2006.
[02:17:48.213 --> 02:17:48.734]  Gold opened at $621.70.
[02:17:48.894 --> 02:17:50.677]  And one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $647.70.
[02:17:50.757 --> 02:17:52.700]  Again, that's $647.70 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[02:17:59.213 --> 02:18:12.121]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:18:12.602 --> 02:18:15.804]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:18:16.304 --> 02:18:19.745]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:18:19.825 --> 02:18:22.826]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[02:18:23.266 --> 02:18:26.087]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:18:26.327 --> 02:18:29.188]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:31.949]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.

[02:18:39.191 --> 02:18:39.391]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:46.366 --> 02:18:48.888]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.548 --> 02:18:56.192]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:18:57.373 --> 02:18:59.674]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:00.475 --> 02:19:06.698]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:19:07.599 --> 02:19:15.664]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.

[02:20:49.249 --> 02:20:50.110]  Look no further!
[02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:52.991]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:20:53.412 --> 02:21:01.916]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:21:02.076 --> 02:21:03.217]  You can order everything you need
[02:21:03.217 --> 02:21:03.517]  I think so.
[02:21:19.497 --> 02:21:20.037]  We're good to go.
[02:21:51.677 --> 02:21:57.501]  Frank Morales is our guest.
[02:21:57.541 --> 02:21:58.562]  He's an Episcopal priest.
[02:21:58.642 --> 02:22:00.864]  He's been involved since the JFK assassination.
[02:22:01.204 --> 02:22:07.529]  Shortly thereafter, involved in real politics and what's really happening, what the military-industrial complex is doing.
[02:22:07.569 --> 02:22:15.836]  To boil it down, the same thing that happened in Rome or with the Aztecs or any culture, we've become corrupt and the generals and the ruling elite have said, let's just take everything over.
[02:22:15.896 --> 02:22:16.916]  We shouldn't have a free market.
[02:22:16.936 --> 02:22:17.757]  We shouldn't have freedom.
[02:22:18.097 --> 02:22:19.819]  We shouldn't have local communities and local control.
[02:22:20.419 --> 02:22:22.580]  We'll just dominate and take power.
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:27.823]  And they're using old imperial models with a new high-tech PR overlay to do it.
[02:22:27.903 --> 02:22:31.845]  But now, we forced a dictator to act like a dictator.
[02:22:31.865 --> 02:22:33.246]  They revealed themselves.
[02:22:33.666 --> 02:22:35.547]  We're seeing a fusion of the left and the right.
[02:22:35.567 --> 02:22:36.767]  The old paradigm is exploding.
[02:22:37.067 --> 02:22:40.349]  Frank Morales, does that excite you, that despite how dark the times are?
[02:22:40.649 --> 02:22:42.830]  I know I've seen this, and I'm trying to get your take.
[02:22:42.850 --> 02:22:45.672]  Have you witnessed this, that I, in my 12 years, you've been doing this for 30,
[02:22:46.879 --> 02:22:55.821]  In my 12 years, I've never seen such an explosion of understanding, such an acceptance instinctively of what's happening and the need to resist.
[02:22:57.462 --> 02:22:58.682]  Yeah, I think you're absolutely correct.
[02:22:58.762 --> 02:23:14.706]  I think just like we're experiencing this sort of phenomenon of two separate realities where you have the so-called mainstream media that essentially, you know, is a voice for the New World Order and their agenda, and you have this incredible alternative media
[02:23:15.302 --> 02:23:16.003]  I don't think so.
[02:23:30.871 --> 02:23:32.612]  That's very conscious of what's happening.
[02:23:32.652 --> 02:23:36.674]  The internet obviously has facilitated the speed of communication and so forth.
[02:23:36.754 --> 02:23:42.957]  And it's now supplanting them and they're openly saying in the Times of London and CNN that they have to shut us down with internet too.
[02:23:43.337 --> 02:23:43.557]  Yeah.
[02:23:43.957 --> 02:23:45.338]  No, they're going to attempt to do that.
[02:23:45.498 --> 02:23:47.619]  I mean, I think we need to be aware of that.
[02:23:48.186 --> 02:23:51.147]  And be thinking in terms of what kinds of alternatives we have.
[02:23:52.787 --> 02:23:59.869]  We need local source libraries so if they do that we can generate it at the grassroots level with the old hand press like the Founding Fathers.
[02:24:00.029 --> 02:24:00.649]  Exactly.
[02:24:00.869 --> 02:24:04.190]  And you know that people, I'm always amazed at how creative people are.
[02:24:04.891 --> 02:24:07.011]  These young people and their technical abilities.
[02:24:07.391 --> 02:24:11.992]  They'll create ways in which to Wi-Fi locally and you know what I mean?
[02:24:12.373 --> 02:24:13.933]  They're not going to be able to stop this.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:16.642]  I think right now the handwriting is on the wall.
[02:24:16.702 --> 02:24:18.163]  The old order is on the way out.
[02:24:18.503 --> 02:24:22.487]  But of course, you know, they're like a trapped, you know, hyena in the corner.
[02:24:22.527 --> 02:24:23.527]  They're going to fight back.
[02:24:23.748 --> 02:24:25.069]  They're going to do what they can.
[02:24:25.549 --> 02:24:35.177]  But as long as we understand that we have the power, and the power, what's closest to us, what we can affect most directly within our own local environment.
[02:24:35.637 --> 02:24:37.619]  We can recodify poppy comatose.
[02:24:37.919 --> 02:24:38.940]  We can talk to it.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:44.144]  We need to educate, communicate with our local entities of force, namely our local police,
[02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:46.463]  And our local National Guard offices.
[02:24:46.503 --> 02:24:48.204]  We're starting to do that in New York now.
[02:24:48.625 --> 02:24:54.268]  We're going to these places... We need to humanize ourselves and let them know there's solidarity.
[02:24:54.388 --> 02:24:55.609]  We need to humanize it.
[02:24:55.729 --> 02:24:56.489]  It's very important.
[02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.590]  Exactly.
[02:24:57.630 --> 02:25:11.018]  The police and the National Guard people... When the rubber hits the road, and these corporate military entities attempt to send troops and police up against us, it's going to be, in some cases, people from the outside.
[02:25:11.038 --> 02:25:12.099]  That's what Bush wants to do.
[02:25:12.139 --> 02:25:13.660]  He wants to take National Guard from
[02:25:14.093 --> 02:25:15.875]  From Wisconsin and bring them to New York.
[02:25:15.895 --> 02:25:19.279]  He wants to take New York out and bring them down to Texas and so on and so forth.
[02:25:19.619 --> 02:25:22.682]  But still in all, we need to approach those people now.
[02:25:23.103 --> 02:25:36.177]  We need to begin to organize, get them all the latest videos, get them Terror Storm, get them all these films, and begin to break down this barrier so that when it comes time for these people, when they get the orders to come up against us, they're going to refuse.
[02:25:37.189 --> 02:25:44.056]  In fact, we might create a situation in which the military and the police are going to turn on these people and say, this game is over.
[02:25:44.637 --> 02:25:48.881]  Well, we're already seeing, the media keeps saying 8, it's more like 15 top generals.
[02:25:49.574 --> 02:25:53.616]  A few of them on this show that's never gotten press attention have gone public saying we're going into dictatorship.
[02:25:53.877 --> 02:25:56.478]  And these are mainly old-line, paleo-conservatives.
[02:25:57.499 --> 02:25:59.400]  And I want to keep this from going violent.
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:03.242]  Frank, what's the danger, though, that if they do gun down some college kids in the streets?
[02:26:03.662 --> 02:26:05.143]  I don't think it's going to be like Penn State.
[02:26:05.243 --> 02:26:12.187]  I mean, I know that former special forces and others are going to go absolutely ape, and I feel sorry for any military that tries to engage the population.
[02:26:12.547 --> 02:26:15.929]  Yeah, my guess, if I was a betting person, I would say that
[02:26:16.554 --> 02:26:20.838]  You know, that's going to be a paper tiger.
[02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:29.066]  There's too many people in this country right now who are dead set against being occupied by anyone.
[02:26:29.287 --> 02:26:37.034]  Whether they're foreigners, whatever insignia they're wearing, whatever state militia they're in, they're not going to stand for it.
[02:26:37.474 --> 02:26:38.135]  As you know, we're not
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:49.543]  As involved in the movement to bear arms and so forth in places like the Northeast and so on.
[02:26:49.843 --> 02:26:53.104]  But I have friends around the country and I know that people aren't going to sit for it.
[02:26:53.464 --> 02:26:56.705]  They're not going to sit for these outsiders coming in and so on.
[02:26:56.725 --> 02:26:58.546]  So what you're getting at is quite correct.
[02:26:58.866 --> 02:27:09.550]  My guess is that if they are foolish enough to go that route, they're going to be rudely awakened to the fact that the American people are not going to go up against one another.
[02:27:09.932 --> 02:27:18.055]  That there's going to be, yeah, there'll be a certain amount of hard heads that are going to, you know, follow Bush and his oil, his oil, uh, agarchy, and, and so on.
[02:27:18.095 --> 02:27:24.997]  But I think the great majority of, uh, of law enforcement people and National Guard people and so forth are going to stick to the Constitution.
[02:27:25.337 --> 02:27:26.717]  Frank Morales, stay there.
[02:27:27.057 --> 02:27:28.918]  And then we're going to reorganize for a better day.
[02:27:29.138 --> 02:27:29.878]  Yes, stay there.
[02:27:29.898 --> 02:27:30.838]  Big segment coming up.
[02:27:30.999 --> 02:27:32.279]  A lot of time to break this down.
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:36.860]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.781]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.779 --> 02:27:42.561]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.184 --> 02:27:52.627]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:53.048 --> 02:27:57.791]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:58.171 --> 02:28:00.812]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:01.293 --> 02:28:04.655]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:09.773]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:10.234 --> 02:28:13.416]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:14.017 --> 02:28:16.859]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:17.637 --> 02:28:19.778]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:19.818 --> 02:28:21.579]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:28:21.599 --> 02:28:21.699]  U.S.
[02:28:21.779 --> 02:28:24.021]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:28:24.041 --> 02:28:24.321]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:24.341 --> 02:28:25.221]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:25.241 --> 02:28:25.762]  Ask for George.
[02:28:45.643 --> 02:28:50.605]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:50.925 --> 02:28:56.346]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.386 --> 02:29:00.688]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.028 --> 02:29:04.029]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.349 --> 02:29:07.790]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:17.477]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:17.718 --> 02:29:21.220]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:28.566]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:30.188]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.
[02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:35.975]  Get two for $70.00 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.115 --> 02:29:38.378]  Order your Berkey Sport today.
[02:29:38.599 --> 02:29:41.182]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:44.947 --> 02:29:46.909]  Sometimes you feel like you're just a number.
[02:29:47.189 --> 02:29:52.493]  To the banks, the credit card companies, the lenders and financial institutions, you are just a number.
[02:29:52.793 --> 02:29:53.874]  Your credit score.
[02:29:54.154 --> 02:29:58.798]  And unless that number is above their standards, you get stuck paying more for everything.
[02:29:59.038 --> 02:30:02.781]  Hi, I'm John Commute, a creator of the Transforming Debt Into Wealth system.
[02:30:03.141 --> 02:30:07.966]  If you don't have perfect credit, banks will either take advantage of you or slam the door in your face.
[02:30:08.286 --> 02:30:13.912]  But I want to send you a free tape that shows you how my proven system will wipe the slate clean once and for all.
[02:30:14.252 --> 02:30:20.879]  My system doesn't just raise your credit score, it will permanently insulate your credit status so it can never come back to haunt you again.
[02:30:20.879 --> 02:30:21.659]  We're good to go.
[02:30:59.754 --> 02:31:04.116]  Canyon in Texas, Common California, Common Maine, Danny in Tennessee, and many others.
[02:31:04.136 --> 02:31:06.236]  We'll get to your calls before this segment ends.
[02:31:06.256 --> 02:31:06.397]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:06.417 --> 02:31:07.737]  We're about to go back to Frank Morales.
[02:31:13.138 --> 02:31:17.759]  I hope that all of you will go to Infowars.com and link through to Amazon.com.
[02:31:18.659 --> 02:31:28.761]  They've been selling TerrorStorm for two and a half days at Amazon.com and it rocketed from, you know, it started out at $7,000 and it rocketed to $51,000 by this morning.
[02:31:28.801 --> 02:31:30.381]  It's gone back down to $63,000.
[02:31:31.821 --> 02:31:35.422]  We basically sold them to Amazon for nothing and they're selling it for $11.19.
[02:31:35.522 --> 02:31:38.063]  My distributor I think sold them to them for like $4.
[02:31:41.118 --> 02:31:43.260]  4.50 or something, because Amazon wants 60% off.
[02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:46.201]  So, you can't beat it at $11.
[02:31:46.261 --> 02:31:47.582]  Go buy four or five copies.
[02:31:47.782 --> 02:31:49.323]  If you can't afford it, buy one copy.
[02:31:49.343 --> 02:31:50.184]  Make copies of it.
[02:31:50.444 --> 02:32:05.993]  You know, I put it up on Google Video for free, but this is the high-quality DVD with the 68 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium on 9-11, out in Los Angeles in June with Webster Tarpley and, of course, Bob Bowman, former head of Air Force
[02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:13.921]  Program with Star Wars, former head of that program, and of course Professor Jim Fetzer, myself and many others.
[02:32:13.941 --> 02:32:16.482]  But the film itself is right at, right under two hours.
[02:32:16.922 --> 02:32:18.402]  The history of government sponsored terror.
[02:32:18.942 --> 02:32:20.782]  Please go to Amazon.com.
[02:32:21.342 --> 02:32:25.763]  You know, don't waste your money on all the corporate junk this holiday season, but go buy ten copies of it.
[02:32:26.563 --> 02:32:26.863]  Okay?
[02:32:26.923 --> 02:32:28.164]  Or nine copies or whatever.
[02:32:28.444 --> 02:32:29.204]  For a hundred bucks.
[02:32:29.264 --> 02:32:30.464]  And give that as a gift.
[02:32:30.964 --> 02:32:36.165]  But the reason we want to drive up to the top ten, if you go into the top ten, that is seen as a gauge.
[02:32:37.225 --> 02:32:46.469]  All over the country by retailers like Barnes and Nobles and Virgin who are now carrying it but they only bought a few copies a piece to buy it in mass.
[02:32:46.509 --> 02:32:56.012]  In fact, the distributor told me this morning they had huge orders from all over the country just because it was in the top 100 in the last day and a half and it's still there but dropping.
[02:32:56.473 --> 02:32:57.073]  Please!
[02:32:57.453 --> 02:33:01.154]  Plus you have millions of people every week that are shopping in those top 100 videos.
[02:33:01.475 --> 02:33:05.196]  That's what they do most of their shopping and most of the other videos never get noticed or get ignored.
[02:33:06.138 --> 02:33:08.019]  So please take action.
[02:33:08.039 --> 02:33:10.440]  That's why we put the film out for free on Google Video.
[02:33:11.161 --> 02:33:13.722]  We have a PrisonPlanet.TV membership for 15 cents a day.
[02:33:13.742 --> 02:33:18.105]  You can download super high-quality versions of it and burn it to disk and use that as an activist tool.
[02:33:18.545 --> 02:33:20.026]  We are in this to wake people up.
[02:33:20.066 --> 02:33:21.987]  We are in this to stop this martial law.
[02:33:22.367 --> 02:33:23.207]  They have declared it.
[02:33:23.287 --> 02:33:24.488]  Now they're trying to implement.
[02:33:24.708 --> 02:33:26.749]  We've got to expose that they're behind the terrorist.
[02:33:26.789 --> 02:33:27.630]  It's so important.
[02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:35.334]  So again, go to InfoWars.com, link through to the sub-page of Amazon.com in the top 100, and order as many Terror Storms as you can.
[02:33:36.435 --> 02:33:38.037]  The distributor's done a really great job.
[02:33:38.057 --> 02:33:39.979]  He gambled putting it out nationwide.
[02:33:40.019 --> 02:33:41.200]  It's very expensive to do.
[02:33:41.981 --> 02:33:45.665]  And this is so exciting what's happening.
[02:33:46.166 --> 02:33:48.288]  So get one copy and make a hundred copies.
[02:33:48.328 --> 02:33:49.289]  Or buy a hundred copies.
[02:33:49.370 --> 02:33:49.790]  Whatever.
[02:33:50.191 --> 02:33:51.172]  Just please help us.
[02:33:51.192 --> 02:33:52.934]  You can also call my office toll free.
[02:33:53.892 --> 02:34:01.575]  And get America freedom to fascism, exposing the private nature of the Federal Reserve and the IRS and the National Identification System.
[02:34:01.815 --> 02:34:05.656]  And they just came and told me that we've driven it from 63 back to 48.
[02:34:06.156 --> 02:34:08.337]  It's never been that high, so thank you.
[02:34:08.737 --> 02:34:10.998]  Let's drive it into the top ten.
[02:34:11.078 --> 02:34:11.578]  Please!
[02:34:12.158 --> 02:34:13.639]  Please drive it into the top ten.
[02:34:14.372 --> 02:34:17.675]  And we will take whatever profits we make from this and put it directly back into the fight.
[02:34:17.975 --> 02:34:19.256]  We are going to expand here.
[02:34:19.296 --> 02:34:21.378]  We are going to meet the enemy head-on.
[02:34:21.618 --> 02:34:28.424]  But call toll-free to get America Freedom to Fascism and you can get TerrorStorm for $9.95 here with your purchase of that if you wish.
[02:34:28.444 --> 02:34:28.504]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:28.524 --> 02:34:31.126]  Going back to my guest, Frank Morales, what does it mean that
[02:34:38.186 --> 02:34:43.328]  Alternative websites that 25-year-olds start are bigger than major newspapers in just a few months.
[02:34:44.048 --> 02:34:45.229]  Some of my sites are big.
[02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:48.010]  PrisonPlanet.com is bigger than Rush Limbaugh.com now.
[02:34:49.770 --> 02:34:50.671]  Again, I'm just one person.
[02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:52.111]  There are thousands of sites.
[02:34:52.171 --> 02:34:53.312]  The media is admitting.
[02:34:53.572 --> 02:34:54.732]  The controlled press is admitting.
[02:34:55.092 --> 02:34:56.913]  We are now supplanting them.
[02:34:56.933 --> 02:34:58.193]  This is incredible news!
[02:34:58.474 --> 02:34:58.674]  Yeah.
[02:34:59.254 --> 02:35:02.095]  Well, I think it's enlightening
[02:35:03.043 --> 02:35:26.038]  It's wonderful news, and basically what it points out is that the mainstream media, the organized corporate media, is so corrupt and devoid of any real information, particularly information that's critical of the Bush administration and the New World Order agenda, that they've become irrelevant to the masses of people.
[02:35:26.963 --> 02:35:31.205]  So naturally, it's kind of a pure entrepreneurial decision.
[02:35:31.245 --> 02:35:38.409]  People are going where the information is hard, is real, is useful, tells them really what's important, and so on.
[02:35:39.477 --> 02:35:40.838]  I think that's a good sign.
[02:35:41.078 --> 02:35:49.606]  Yeah, it's kind of amazing that you have these two, like the Matrix, you know, you have these two separate realities that are going on.
[02:35:49.946 --> 02:36:02.016]  But I think what we should be aware of as well is that the opposition, you know, the Bush people, one of the tried and true tactics of these people is to divide us.
[02:36:02.977 --> 02:36:05.059]  And, you know, we saw that
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.782]  In the Operation Gladio kinds of tactics and so on.
[02:36:09.802 --> 02:36:19.907]  I mean, exposing 9-11 is, in a sense, creating a situation where they feel they need to create some kind of martial law situation.
[02:36:19.987 --> 02:36:24.309]  If you're a bushing company, you're sitting around going, man, they're ready to expose this thing.
[02:36:24.329 --> 02:36:28.511]  The fact that we are complicit in this, we are orchestrating this thing, us and our friends and so on.
[02:36:28.531 --> 02:36:30.952]  So we better call martial law, set this up quick.
[02:36:31.453 --> 02:36:33.694]  So there is a relationship between the truth of 9-11
[02:36:34.770 --> 02:36:51.615]  And this headlong move towards martial law, but the point I want to make is that a few years back, people at the Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, the war college there, put out a paper which was entitled, The Potential for Internal Civil War in the U.S.
[02:36:52.215 --> 02:36:59.117]  And what they were talking about was the potential for an internal civil war.
[02:37:00.037 --> 02:37:03.458]  We know that the tried and true tactic of the ruler is to divide us.
[02:37:03.982 --> 02:37:17.506]  In order to keep things in tow, we need to get away from this red state, blue state thing, and so on, and begin to link up all across this nation, and clearly identify who our common enemy is.
[02:37:17.586 --> 02:37:21.087]  I mean, we're going to have differences in terms of some particular aspects.
[02:37:21.107 --> 02:37:26.009]  Well, you're right, but what they do is they always try to put it back in a Republican-Democrat
[02:37:26.647 --> 02:37:33.552]  Framework, a liberal versus conservative, because they control both those avenues, they can then dissipate all of our energy.
[02:37:34.073 --> 02:37:34.593]  Exactly.
[02:37:34.933 --> 02:37:54.388]  So I think to the greatest extent that we can come together, particularly around defending ourselves, defending our communities, creating lawful means by which we can protect our communities against federal encroachment, whether it's placing National Guard in our neighborhoods from other states and so on and so forth,
[02:37:55.121 --> 02:37:57.043]  We'll be doing this in common across the country.
[02:37:57.063 --> 02:37:58.004]  We're unstoppable.
[02:37:58.184 --> 02:38:00.385]  Sure, let me make two points and I want to get your take on it.
[02:38:00.405 --> 02:38:01.426]  We're going to take some calls.
[02:38:01.466 --> 02:38:07.992]  Frank Morales, Episcopal Priest in New York for decades, been fighting this whole police state takeover, really done incredible research.
[02:38:08.812 --> 02:38:15.297]  In fact, one of his latest articles, Bush Moves Toward Martial Law, is up on Infowars.com.
[02:38:15.337 --> 02:38:16.478]  Be sure and go read it.
[02:38:16.799 --> 02:38:19.641]  Go look at the subsections of the legislation that passed.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:30.142]  For yourself, you know, this double-headed creature, the HR-6166, and now the military funding package is just incredible.
[02:38:30.162 --> 02:38:31.062]  But let me bring up two points.
[02:38:31.563 --> 02:38:35.183]  People say, they mention what you just said, but they go further.
[02:38:35.203 --> 02:38:41.005]  They say, well, you're exposing them for 9-11, so that's ensuring they'll launch a bigger attack because they're cornered.
[02:38:41.025 --> 02:38:41.985]  And this is the point I make.
[02:38:42.851 --> 02:38:57.477]  They were already intending to launch more attacks in the West, in England, in Israel, the US, to mobilize the people around the state, around the apparatchik controlled by these big corporations that puppeteer our entire system as pawns.
[02:38:58.328 --> 02:39:06.310]  And so it's either they were going to carry out attacks and bring in their total control, or we're going to go ahead and expose them and they're going to carry out attacks regardless.
[02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:16.353]  But at least then we do it on our terms, and it's a desperation move, and it's a gamble by them, and then there's a greater chance it's going to backfire and we're going to have victory.
[02:39:16.373 --> 02:39:17.813]  Do you want to comment on that?
[02:39:18.313 --> 02:39:23.435]  Yeah, I mean, maybe I sound trite, but for me, it's a simple moral choice.
[02:39:23.515 --> 02:39:27.636]  I mean, if we recognize that our friends and neighbors have been murdered by someone,
[02:39:28.211 --> 02:39:32.373]  Are we going to sit back because we feel like greater reprisals if we expose this murder?
[02:39:32.393 --> 02:39:35.654]  You know, I mean, to me it's a no-brainer.
[02:39:36.134 --> 02:39:37.715]  I mean, these people are complicit.
[02:39:37.755 --> 02:39:43.717]  It's clear that they orchestrated this thing in order to legitimate their global agenda and so forth.
[02:39:43.737 --> 02:39:45.337]  We have no choice but to expose it.
[02:39:45.758 --> 02:39:49.519]  And I think beyond that, I think exposing it, yeah, it's going to cause a reaction on their part.
[02:39:49.539 --> 02:39:52.800]  They're going to come with, as you're pointing out, what they had already planned anyway.
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:57.462]  But the fact is that we're going to gain more credibility because we're speaking the truth.
[02:39:58.103 --> 02:40:00.344]  We're going to create more people that are going to come involved.
[02:40:00.364 --> 02:40:08.006]  So when it comes down to the final, you know, series of confrontations with these people, you know, it'll assure our victory.
[02:40:08.306 --> 02:40:14.268]  I think it's never a sin to speak the truth to power, and I think we've just got to stick to it.
[02:40:14.288 --> 02:40:14.788]  Well, that's it.
[02:40:14.888 --> 02:40:24.811]  In fact, the Founding Fathers said over and over again, the Greek philosophers stated that, and the Founding Fathers were really just paraphrasing it, that duty belongs to us and consequence belongs to God.
[02:40:26.111 --> 02:40:30.156]  I mean, it's like when you find out your neighbor's got dead kids buried in the basement.
[02:40:30.196 --> 02:40:34.641]  Well, it's going to be embarrassing, and well, we were friends with the neighbor, and you know, let's just keep it quiet.
[02:40:34.702 --> 02:40:35.903]  No, you wouldn't keep it quiet.
[02:40:36.343 --> 02:40:37.124]  It's something bad.
[02:40:37.164 --> 02:40:40.088]  It's something rotten and stinking, and it's not going to go away.
[02:40:40.448 --> 02:40:40.909]  Exactly.
[02:40:42.203 --> 02:40:46.386]  Before we go to calls, let me bring up one other central point to all of this.
[02:40:47.367 --> 02:40:49.608]  We're not just putting a good face on this.
[02:40:50.289 --> 02:40:51.369]  We're talking about the negative.
[02:40:51.389 --> 02:40:53.111]  We're talking about the reality of what's happened.
[02:40:53.911 --> 02:40:56.993]  But at the same time, we're not trying to be cheerleaders here.
[02:40:57.473 --> 02:40:58.754]  People really are waking up.
[02:40:58.874 --> 02:41:09.542]  Groves every week of top generals and CIA and writers and artists and people on the right and the left are going public about 9-11 and every other issue.
[02:41:09.942 --> 02:41:11.643]  And I see a cascading
[02:41:12.603 --> 02:41:13.524]  Cascading event.
[02:41:13.564 --> 02:41:16.065]  Frank Morales, when do you think we're going to see a break?
[02:41:16.105 --> 02:41:23.849]  When do you think the neocons are going to be forced to move with their big attempted distraction?
[02:41:24.709 --> 02:41:30.372]  Well, you know, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think it's going to be rather soon.
[02:41:31.453 --> 02:41:33.714]  We have these elections coming up very soon.
[02:41:33.734 --> 02:41:38.076]  That's telling whether or not they attempt to steal them again.
[02:41:39.427 --> 02:41:56.523]  You know, I think there are a number of factors coming to play now that sort of insinuates the possibility that we're looking at some kind of false flag operation, maybe an assassination, a bioterror event, etc.
[02:41:56.963 --> 02:42:01.848]  There's a lot of signs pointing to something along that line in the near future.
[02:42:02.403 --> 02:42:05.385]  So I think, you know, things are going to be moving fast now.
[02:42:05.466 --> 02:42:18.396]  On the other side, I think that there are people now within the military, in particular, as I've been looking at this reaction to this martial law plan here, that are maybe ready to step out.
[02:42:18.977 --> 02:42:22.580]  And if we get that kind of thing happening, then things could happen rather quickly.
[02:42:22.660 --> 02:42:24.061]  So I think everyone needs to be
[02:42:24.628 --> 02:42:25.249]  Well, I agree.
[02:42:25.289 --> 02:42:26.510]  I think that it's a crossroads.
[02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:27.351]  It's not even a choice.
[02:42:27.371 --> 02:42:28.472]  We don't have a choice.
[02:42:28.492 --> 02:42:31.194]  The enemy's hubris, their arrogance, they're moving forward regardless.
[02:42:49.145 --> 02:43:07.581]  The only thing I think that can at least derail it for a time is there are fractures and subgroups within the Anglo-American-European tar baby that we know at Bilderberg Group meetings, now going back four years, they're fighting with each other, they're screaming at each other, they're throwing things at each other.
[02:43:08.041 --> 02:43:12.986]  A lot of old line elites think the neocons have accelerated things too quickly and are endangering the entire enterprise.
[02:43:14.457 --> 02:43:42.749]  And we may see, we've already seen that, you know, scandals coming out about the, you know, all the weird pervert behavior in the Congress, and those are shots across the bow in the Washington Post coming out against Bush, and all these other things happening, and this war in heaven, as one writer put it, there in D.C., that they might just kind of remove them like they did Nixon, trying to give the dog a bone, making the people think that Bush is the head, and that, okay, we've won, now go back to sleep.
[02:43:43.229 --> 02:43:43.469]  Right.
[02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:46.910]  I mean, do you see that happening?
[02:43:47.270 --> 02:44:08.757]  Yeah, I mean, there'll be an attempt, I would presume, if they don't try to go full-scale and, you know, put Halliburton's detention centers on every street corner, there'll be an attempt to limit the damage, take out, you know, move a bush to the side, and try to scapegoat some of these people so they can move on to another day.
[02:44:09.157 --> 02:44:12.718]  But I think at the same time, in terms of the pendulum, you know, yeah, if they do that,
[02:44:13.303 --> 02:44:25.326]  And in a sense, it opens up some more space for us, and we've got something going as a movement now that's so strong, and it's like a river, you know, filling certain crevices and so forth as they become open.
[02:44:26.006 --> 02:44:27.747]  You know, it's all going to work for us.
[02:44:28.087 --> 02:44:40.750]  I mean, I don't see, you know, I think that we just need to stick with it and keep growing, and, you know, we can expect that there'll be an attempt to do some damage control on this thing, but either way, you know, it's a win-win situation for us.
[02:44:40.930 --> 02:44:41.850]  I agree, but I want to be...
[02:44:42.734 --> 02:44:42.954]  Sure.
[02:44:43.034 --> 02:44:44.515]  I mean, I want to be clear about this.
[02:44:45.215 --> 02:45:02.840]  They can kill our leaders, they can try to shoot a crowd of people and try to scare everybody, but I've noticed with Afghanistan, Iraq, 9-11, London bombings and all these events, they're getting less and less of a bump in the polls, less and less of a propaganda win out of each event.
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:06.681]  And that it may look bad for a month or two months or even a year.
[02:45:07.421 --> 02:45:08.901]  Things could get really dark, folks.
[02:45:09.021 --> 02:45:17.562]  But again, under the surface, it's going to only, well, it's like Thomas Jefferson said, the tree of liberty is watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:45:17.642 --> 02:45:24.324]  And I mean, if they want to fertilize and throw gasoline on the fire, that a thousand times what they've already done, they can go ahead and make that move.
[02:45:24.724 --> 02:45:24.944]  Yeah.
[02:45:25.624 --> 02:45:25.824]  Yeah.
[02:45:26.004 --> 02:45:28.504]  It's, you know, we can't control all of that.
[02:45:28.564 --> 02:45:32.025]  All we can control is our ability to organize ourselves and educate and
[02:45:34.353 --> 02:45:42.436]  And at the same time, not to sugarcoat it either.
[02:45:42.476 --> 02:45:48.518]  Yeah, Halliburton got their 300 plus million contract to make these detentions happen.
[02:45:48.538 --> 02:45:49.498]  And that's for the second wave.
[02:45:49.558 --> 02:45:51.579]  They got a bigger contract in 2002.
[02:45:52.039 --> 02:45:52.539]  Exactly.
[02:45:52.599 --> 02:45:54.180]  So yeah, that stuff's out there.
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:56.601]  But at the same time, there are a lot of people waking up
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:05.187]  and uh... you know that the handwritings on the wall when the police and the military and the national guard people really begin to come aware of this and say hey we're not doing this and we're going to do it.
[02:46:05.207 --> 02:46:07.909]  Yeah, they tried to gun confiscate New Orleans and it fell apart.
[02:46:07.929 --> 02:46:08.750]  Let's take a call.
[02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:10.271]  Let's talk to Canyon in Texas.
[02:46:10.311 --> 02:46:12.032]  Thanks for holding her on the air with Frank Morales.
[02:46:13.053 --> 02:46:14.114]  Hello Alex, hello Frank.
[02:46:14.614 --> 02:46:18.637]  At last we're finally getting to the point where we're seeing people wake up now.
[02:46:19.078 --> 02:46:21.600]  I would like to keep this going and yesterday
[02:46:22.509 --> 02:46:30.072]  Alex was talking about Google and how we really do need to start looking at alternatives where search engines are concerned.
[02:46:30.112 --> 02:46:31.032]  Yeah, they're government-run.
[02:46:31.052 --> 02:46:32.292]  We have the insiders on that.
[02:46:33.213 --> 02:46:49.678]  What I would like to see happen is some sort of an open-source, well, almost internet-run, I mean a totally neutral, peer-to-peer type search engine that uses the principles
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:53.201]  That Nutella uses, it's totally decentralized.
[02:46:54.401 --> 02:46:56.201]  That's what Google does, lots of data centers.
[02:46:56.741 --> 02:46:57.061]  Oh, really?
[02:46:57.481 --> 02:47:04.543]  Okay, but yeah, where no one person has ownership of it, no one corporation has ownership of it.
[02:47:04.963 --> 02:47:07.543]  Well, I mean, that's what the organic web has become.
[02:47:08.843 --> 02:47:12.424]  Okay, I'm just worried about it becoming too centralized.
[02:47:12.464 --> 02:47:17.205]  No, they're attempting to buy up everything, but then people migrate away from whatever they co-opt.
[02:47:17.245 --> 02:47:18.145]  Frank, you want to comment on that?
[02:47:19.108 --> 02:47:25.453]  Well, you know, I mean, I'm not really that web-savvy.
[02:47:26.854 --> 02:47:37.841]  You know, I just think that we need to just utilize the technology that's available to us while it's available to us the best we can, and I'll leave those who are more familiar with the particulars to work that out.
[02:47:38.582 --> 02:47:39.923]  Okay, now, one other thing.
[02:47:40.363 --> 02:47:44.046]  I got to thinking after listening to a show about
[02:47:45.223 --> 02:47:53.508]  Shortwave radio and such that maybe it would be a good idea for you Alex to have a sponsor selling shortwave radios.
[02:47:53.708 --> 02:47:55.189]  Boy, you know, you're not the only one.
[02:47:55.469 --> 02:47:59.011]  I just never have the time to go out and get that sponsor.
[02:47:59.251 --> 02:48:06.616]  We don't spend our time really, we should, trying to make money because then we can do a better job and hire more people.
[02:48:06.676 --> 02:48:08.657]  But yeah, I think about it a lot.
[02:48:08.697 --> 02:48:09.237]  We need to do that.
[02:48:10.982 --> 02:48:13.124]  Unfortunately, I'm going to have to run out on you now.
[02:48:13.164 --> 02:48:15.747]  I've got to go pick up the kids from school.
[02:48:16.328 --> 02:48:21.253]  Frank, thank you so much for spending time with us and stay with us one more minute.
[02:48:21.273 --> 02:48:22.714]  I just want to say bye to you during the break.
[02:48:22.995 --> 02:48:23.475]  Okay.
[02:48:23.595 --> 02:48:25.898]  And thank you for all the time and I really appreciate
[02:48:26.438 --> 02:48:29.522]  You're great work, especially with this detailed article you wrote.
[02:48:29.562 --> 02:48:30.943]  Bush moved towards martial law.
[02:48:31.323 --> 02:48:32.665]  He's moved into martial law.
[02:48:32.685 --> 02:48:35.007]  That is, he's taken the safety off.
[02:48:35.488 --> 02:48:37.090]  Now the question is, will he pull the trigger?
[02:48:37.370 --> 02:48:38.571]  Fred Arales has been our guest.
[02:48:38.591 --> 02:48:40.353]  We'll take some final calls in the final segment.
[02:48:40.693 --> 02:48:41.114]  Straight ahead.
[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:49.240]  It's here!
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:54.203]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.583 --> 02:49:02.247]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.927 --> 02:49:09.991]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.391 --> 02:49:17.235]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.751 --> 02:49:21.793]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.113 --> 02:49:25.594]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.074 --> 02:49:27.955]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.335 --> 02:49:32.256]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:56.410 --> 02:52:04.433]  Well, they used to put food in cans, and they want to throw it on the moon and eat it raw.
[02:52:04.673 --> 02:52:10.854]  I can see the day coming when you and your whole garden's gonna be in the law.
[02:52:23.959 --> 02:52:25.841]  I love this line.
[02:52:26.081 --> 02:52:26.761]  Crank it up!
[02:52:48.772 --> 02:52:51.214]  But I guess that's better left unsaid.
[02:52:51.374 --> 02:52:53.576]  I guess that's better left unsaid.
[02:52:54.917 --> 02:52:57.579]  Right now, it's number 48 on Amazon.com.
[02:52:57.599 --> 02:53:00.982]  Go to InfoWars.com, link through, buy as many Terrorist Worms as you can.
[02:53:01.402 --> 02:53:03.824]  You can't beat them at 11 bucks and 19 cents.
[02:53:04.585 --> 02:53:06.186]  Get them, give them to everybody you know.
[02:53:06.226 --> 02:53:07.387]  Go absolutely crazy.
[02:53:07.487 --> 02:53:08.408]  Amazon.com.
[02:53:08.808 --> 02:53:10.169]  Help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:10.589 --> 02:53:12.150]  And also, we got Freedom and Fascism.
[02:53:12.491 --> 02:53:15.093]  Be sure and order that from us as well.
[02:53:15.962 --> 02:53:18.224]  Let's go to Tom in California, then Tom and then Danny.
[02:53:18.484 --> 02:53:19.125]  Real quick, guys.
[02:53:19.145 --> 02:53:19.725]  Go ahead, Tom.
[02:53:20.386 --> 02:53:34.578]  Alex, how do you respond, number one, how do you respond to somebody who says the MCA Act only affects aliens, number one, and number two, the argument that Placid Comitatus
[02:53:35.799 --> 02:53:40.182]  The signing of legislation due to the fact that there was no federal response to Katrina.
[02:53:40.502 --> 02:53:54.373]  Sure, there's all of the JAG officers and lawyers and constitutional experts we've had on, but I don't need them, and they all agree of course, or I agree with them, but don't need to have the rubber stamp either.
[02:53:54.393 --> 02:53:55.694]  They say what I'm saying right now.
[02:53:56.234 --> 02:54:01.038]  I've studied it, and the Military Commissions Act does affect U.S.
[02:54:01.058 --> 02:54:01.478]  citizens,
[02:54:02.290 --> 02:54:03.972]  We've gone over this over and over again.
[02:54:03.992 --> 02:54:04.493]  I know.
[02:54:05.133 --> 02:54:10.520]  And then the argument that posse commentatus is needed because Bush botched the job in New Orleans.
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:12.983]  They had the power to go into New Orleans.
[02:54:13.403 --> 02:54:18.669]  They staged, that's why FEMA kept everybody out and sabotaged on purpose as I told you a year ago when it happened.
[02:54:19.270 --> 02:54:20.932]  And as the police on this show told you.
[02:54:21.879 --> 02:54:24.802]  Uh, to get to make the crisis bigger than to shell this.
[02:54:25.323 --> 02:54:34.271]  And then you read the new Military Funding Act, and you go in there and it says for rebellion, you know, conspiracy, all of these things.
[02:54:34.311 --> 02:54:35.732]  So the facts are the facts.
[02:54:35.792 --> 02:54:37.974]  I mean... And how did they make you an alien?
[02:54:38.014 --> 02:54:39.576]  How did they take away your citizenship?
[02:54:39.776 --> 02:54:44.340]  Okay, well, the president, the vice president, the defense secretary, or their designate,
[02:54:45.175 --> 02:54:48.777]  That's what they've argued in four federal court cases, Jose Padilla and others.
[02:54:49.317 --> 02:54:52.018]  They grab you and say that you were fighting for foreign power.
[02:54:52.038 --> 02:54:52.719]  You're not a citizen.
[02:54:53.779 --> 02:54:55.280]  It says in the subsection.
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:56.961]  I've written articles on it with the subsection.
[02:54:57.361 --> 02:55:02.183]  Constitutional law scholars at Harvard, Yale, UT, everywhere have said the same thing.
[02:55:02.283 --> 02:55:05.545]  Where can I find that so I can argue my Republican acquaintance?
[02:55:06.105 --> 02:55:13.409]  You just go to PrisonPlanet.com and type in non-allegiance to Bush is terrorism.
[02:55:14.476 --> 02:55:15.777]  I mean, it's the headlines.
[02:55:15.817 --> 02:55:16.918]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:16.938 --> 02:55:17.938]  It's a search engine.
[02:55:18.378 --> 02:55:19.639]  I'm sure you're proficient with one.
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:21.820]  Yes.
[02:55:22.441 --> 02:55:23.001]  I'll look for it.
[02:55:23.041 --> 02:55:24.042]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:55:24.262 --> 02:55:24.662]  Thank you.
[02:55:24.722 --> 02:55:25.783]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:25.843 --> 02:55:26.943]  I mean, the facts are the facts.
[02:55:26.963 --> 02:55:29.685]  Hell, you're going to see the troops marching down the street when people know it's real?
[02:55:30.405 --> 02:55:32.847]  You think they've been doing urban warfare drills for decades for nothing?
[02:55:35.768 --> 02:55:36.829]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[02:55:37.129 --> 02:55:37.869]  Tom in Maine.
[02:55:37.929 --> 02:55:38.790]  Go ahead, Tom, quickly.
[02:55:41.161 --> 02:55:47.250]  I just want to say one of the best things I think we can do until we go to full-blown martial law is to exercise our power of jury nullification.
[02:55:47.290 --> 02:55:55.722]  I wish you had to hear more about it on the radio because you know when these scum come after us with these fake drug charges and these fake tax evasion charges and these fake
[02:55:56.555 --> 02:55:57.055]  That's right.
[02:55:57.095 --> 02:55:58.396]  We've got to stand up and say, NO!
[02:55:58.816 --> 02:55:59.036]  NO!
[02:55:59.676 --> 02:56:08.360]  If something's non-violent, you sit there like a secret agent on the jury, you don't tell them nothing, you act stupid, and then you say, not guilty, not guilty, not guilty.
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:11.901]  That's why the American Bar Association says they want to get rid of juries.
[02:56:12.822 --> 02:56:14.082]  I wish you'd talk about that more.
[02:56:14.562 --> 02:56:16.943]  Well, we've talked about it a lot, actually.
[02:56:17.283 --> 02:56:18.284]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:18.704 --> 02:56:20.425]  Sorry to Danny and others.
[02:56:20.485 --> 02:56:22.426]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:22.466 --> 02:56:23.306]  God bless you all.
