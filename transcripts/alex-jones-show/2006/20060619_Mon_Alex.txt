[00:00:05.654 --> 00:00:06.315]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:08.035]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:09.856]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:12.977]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:17.399]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:21.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.421]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:36.905]  It is June 19, 2006, a live Monday edition.
[00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.367]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:40.648]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:44.231]  I trust you had a good weekend with your families out there.
[00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:48.474]  Huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:58.463]  Coming up in the next hour in studio, we're going to have Greg Pallast, and we'll be videotaping it, putting it on the local TV show and on the website for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:07.350]  He'll be joining us to talk about his new book, and also a little bit about the monster, who's not a real conservative, Ann Coulter.
[00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:19.953]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we're going to be talking to Don McCormick of Canada, along with Joe Bird, and they were out there at the Bilderberg event outside the gates with us.
[00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:50.727]  and uh... one of them was picked up another one of them was a witness to this and taken to some type of national security office and interrogated threatened reportedly i was called an insurgent and so we'll give you a kind of an inside view on some of things that were happening Daniel Estillon was pulled over and interrogated himself he of course is a Canadian citizen I haven't ever really talked about that on air we had Daniel on last uh... what was it thursday and i forgot to even bring that up so
[00:01:51.636 --> 00:02:00.158]  Lots of secret police activity going on for simply trying to report on 120 of the world's biggest elite meeting.
[00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:04.219]  It was in the Toronto Star of all places today.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.440]  More about the Bilderberg Group a week and a half late.
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.201]  It was also in some of the Portugal papers over the weekend as well.
[00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:17.923]  Those reports are all on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.624]  In the meantime, we've got the big North Korean latest crises.
[00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:35.655]  North Koreans said to be near a missile test, and so we are flashing back to a test missile that reportedly hit Alaska, and they're reportedly about to test another one of these missiles.
[00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:40.860]  They've also fired missiles that have landed in the ocean just miles from the Japanese coast.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.080]  What?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.362]  Three separate times that we know of.
[00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:47.587]  The Japanese are rightly very upset right now.
[00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:55.536]  Again, these are not tipped with atom bombs or hydrogen bombs or neutron bombs or any other type of fissile material.
[00:02:56.616 --> 00:03:03.703]  They are test warheads that would carry a payload, but still, it's not very friendly when people are firing missiles at you.
[00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:07.567]  Can you imagine how they would have loved it if Saddam would have fired some type of test missile?
[00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:10.850]  Of course, he didn't even have missiles that could hit Israel by 2002, 2003.
[00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.011]  All his old Scuds had fallen apart.
[00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.163]  Just like your car, if you park it outside for a few years, it falls apart.
[00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:24.246]  Well, these Scuds were built, his best Scuds were built in the 60's.
[00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:28.628]  They'd all fallen apart and they only had about a 400-500 mile range to begin with.
[00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:34.592]  Well, North Korea has real missiles, real intercontinental ballistics, long range missiles.
[00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:41.498]  On the low end, they just barely meet the criteria of a long-range missile.
[00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:42.759]  But they are long-range.
[00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.821]  They are more than medium-range.
[00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:51.567]  Of course, Pakistan also has these medium-range and quote long-range missiles.
[00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:52.448]  So does India.
[00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:55.767]  But no one seems to be worried about that.
[00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:58.148]  They're only worried about Iran.
[00:03:58.268 --> 00:04:04.651]  Will they someday, off over the rainbow, get an A-bomb and kill us all?
[00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:12.414]  There have been lots of national TV reports and magazine covers about their super EMP bombs that could knock us back to the Stone Age.
[00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.235]  They've got super weapons.
[00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.736]  They've got death rays.
[00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:18.717]  Oh, save us, world government!
[00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:20.803]  So we'll get into that report.
[00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:23.404]  Also, several mainstream news articles here.
[00:04:23.884 --> 00:04:31.428]  Lockheed Martin has designed super spy blimps that are many times bigger than the Goodyear blimp to be over every U.S.
[00:04:31.468 --> 00:04:32.688]  city surveilling us.
[00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:36.350]  We told you about this years ago, but now they're beginning to go into service.
[00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.691]  One of them has gone into service.
[00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:39.812]  Giant blimps.
[00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:42.133]  Huge platforms.
[00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:45.815]  So we'll get into that report for you.
[00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:50.159]  And much more after this quick break.
[00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.421]  Huge broadcast.
[00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:53.383]  Again, Greg Palast joining us next hour.
[00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:57.790]  Two eyewitnesses to tyranny in Canada coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.531]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.246 --> 00:05:09.515]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:12.038]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:21.489]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.512]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:46.790]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.833]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.

[00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:36.507]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:07.137]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:17.565]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation, we're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:18.866]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:19.286 --> 00:08:21.828]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:22.728 --> 00:08:30.712]  Greg Pallast will be joining us, BBC reporter, documentary filmmaker, best-selling author, will be joining us in studio in the next hour.
[00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:35.654]  And in about 22 minutes from now, we're going to be joined by Joe Byrd and Don McCormick.
[00:08:36.274 --> 00:08:41.237]  They were at the Bilderberg group conference, so they're with the press and the demonstrators, the protesters.
[00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:50.181]  Wait till you hear the story they have to tell of what happened to them, how Don McCormick was picked up and brought in and interrogated by national security.
[00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:54.107]  Yeldat Kastet threatened and I was called an insurgent.
[00:08:55.428 --> 00:08:56.669]  Isn't that just special?
[00:08:56.729 --> 00:09:00.032]  Just trying to go up there to report on what the globalists are doing.
[00:09:00.912 --> 00:09:02.573]  The people that are creating the American Union.
[00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:05.375]  The people that are destroying our sovereignty right now.
[00:09:08.037 --> 00:09:12.040]  But before I get into the situation with North Korea, let me just cover this first.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.422]  This is from Free Market News Network.
[00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:17.437]  And the government orders spy blimp.
[00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:24.903]  The government has hired defense subcontractor Lockheed Martin to design and develop an enormous blimp that will be used to spy on Americans.
[00:09:24.943 --> 00:09:26.964]  We first reported this about five years ago, remember?
[00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:39.472]  According to the Athens News, government agencies such as the NSA are anticipating that as early as 2009, the blimp will be operational and begin supporting new ways of monitoring everything that happens in this country.
[00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:43.475]  A prototype of the blimp is already being developed at a cost of $40 million.
[00:09:43.635 --> 00:09:44.436]  It's already in the sky.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.262]  That was in the news, what, two years ago?
[00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:50.164]  That DC has one flying over it?
[00:09:51.105 --> 00:09:59.052]  And they also converted the Fuji blimp at the 2004 Olympics in Greece and then also at the RNC, remember that?
[00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:08.101]  The spy ship, called the High Altitude Airship, will be 17 times larger than the Goodyear blimp, and hover 12 miles above the Earth.
[00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:14.524]  Although it is very large, it will be invisible to both the naked eye and ground radar, because of its distance from the Earth.
[00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:20.628]  Yes, it's unmanned, up in the high atmosphere, a giant platform.
[00:10:20.688 --> 00:10:26.831]  Fuel-economic and self-sufficient, it will be powered by solar energy, and will be able to fly for years at a time.
[00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:31.044]  And of course, this is really the brainchild of Alexander Haig.
[00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:50.199]  I remember him 15 years ago, well I remember learning of it about a decade ago, but documents going back really over 15 years, where he proposed instead of satellites, you can put mega blimps up in the high atmosphere, and then they can be solar powered, because there's masses of sun up there, and be used for telecommunications, you name it.
[00:10:51.002 --> 00:11:00.973]  And as usual, the government watch will deploy these, and then large sections of it will be seeded and given to large corporations like AT&T and others.
[00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:04.376]  They do that time and time again.
[00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:11.183]  It goes on, although it will be very large, it will be invisible to both the naked eye and ground radar because of its distance from Earth.
[00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:13.494]  Economic and self-sufficient.
[00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:16.837]  It will be powered by solar energy and will be able to fly for years at a time.
[00:11:16.857 --> 00:11:22.883]  The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command have already conducted a study to determine some of the uses of the airship.
[00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:24.200]  The spy ship.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:32.610]  It has the capability of monitoring an area 600 miles in diameter at a time with surveillance equipment such as high-resolution cameras.
[00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:38.556]  The government has ordered 11 of them, enough to monitor every parcel of land in the U.S.
[00:11:39.177 --> 00:11:44.163]  and that is reported again by Free Market News and also out of the Athens Journal, Athens News.
[00:11:45.715 --> 00:11:47.816]  So, that's what we had to look forward to.
[00:11:47.836 --> 00:11:59.660]  I have another article here out of the LA Times today about hover drones, hundreds of which have been ordered by the LAPD, I first saw this in the news a year ago, to fly around spying on you.
[00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.462]  So, it's right out of They Live.
[00:12:03.982 --> 00:12:05.323]  Hello, my little friend.
[00:12:06.423 --> 00:12:08.144]  Come to tell them where I am.
[00:12:08.164 --> 00:12:10.745]  Have you seen that movie?
[00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:14.166]  When you look at these little hover drones, some of them look just like it.
[00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:18.077]  It just gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:23.360]  Here's the New York Times giving us a big news report on this Monday.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.222]  Why, North Koreans said to be near a missile test!
[00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:28.243]  Oh my goodness!
[00:12:29.524 --> 00:12:33.266]  North Korea appears to have completed fueling a long-range ballistic missile.
[00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:41.811]  American officials said Sunday a move that greatly increases the probability that it will go ahead with its first important test launch in eight years.
[00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:48.623]  New York Times, it was all over Japanese and Korean press, there was another big test and the U.S.
[00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:50.604]  was hit by a test missile, Alaska.
[00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:52.145]  Why don't you report on that?
[00:12:52.766 --> 00:13:04.715]  A senior American official said the intelligence from satellite photographs suggested that booster rockets had been loaded onto a launching pad and liquid fuel tanks fitted to a missile at the site of North Korea's remote east coast.
[00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:14.612]  While there have been study reports in recent days about preparations for a test, fueling is regarded as a critical step as well as probable bellwether of North Korea's intention.
[00:13:15.372 --> 00:13:18.633]  Siphoning liquid fuel out of a missile is a complex undertaking.
[00:13:19.253 --> 00:13:31.357]  Yes, looks like all systems are go and fueling appears to be done, said the official who discussed the matter only after being promised anonymity because he was addressing delicate diplomatic and intelligence issues.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.309]  A second senior official who declined to speak on the record for similar reasons also indicated that the United States believed that the missile had been fueled.
[00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:51.201]  A launching would be a milestone in North Korea's missile capacity and effectively scrap a moratorium on such tests declared by North Koreans after the last test of 98.
[00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:53.143]  Moreover, a launching
[00:13:53.183 --> 00:14:04.246]  Launching would have enormous importance for American security because it would mean that North Korea's first flight test of a long-range missile that might eventually have the capability to strike the United States.
[00:14:06.286 --> 00:14:14.988]  A launching could also ignite a political chain reaction in Japan, the United States, and China, which have been trying to re-engage North Korea in stalled talks about its nuclear weapons program.
[00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:19.299]  The Bush administration might step up financing for missile defense.
[00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:21.801]  Japan might increase its missile defense efforts as well.
[00:14:22.101 --> 00:14:29.688]  While militant Japanese politicians might push to reconsider the nation's nuclear weapons options such as moves most likely would alienate China.
[00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:30.889]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:42.419]  Head Japanese politicians in their parliament have reported as of two years ago that they are already developing nuclear weapons.
[00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:43.520]  Let me say that again.
[00:14:44.278 --> 00:14:50.584]  Japan, the last time North Korea did a test, said we're going to develop nukes.
[00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:54.608]  That was reported as if it's not even newsworthy.
[00:14:55.869 --> 00:15:07.279]  And remember what was it, about eight years ago, there was that big nuclear spill, and there were all those Japanese in a weird government facility, hand-mixing very high-grade, weapons-grade uranium.
[00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:07.640]  Remember?
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.081]  It was all just shut down real quiet.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.220]  Yes, hand-mixing.
[00:15:11.461 --> 00:15:15.422]  That's how secretively, and these people will just sacrifice themselves.
[00:15:16.143 --> 00:15:17.903]  There's all sorts of secret stuff going on.
[00:15:18.964 --> 00:15:21.445]  The big scandal, what was it again, about eight years ago?
[00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:23.105]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:38.352]  When France and the EU sold just masses of uranium and plutonium, weapons-grade to them, and there was the big super triple-hull tanker, and no country would let it even get near their coastlines because it was so dangerous to be transporting it to Japan.
[00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:41.855]  And now Japan openly has been saying, we're going to develop nukes.
[00:15:42.355 --> 00:15:44.317]  You better watch yourself North Korea.
[00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:46.118]  You don't know what we have.
[00:15:46.598 --> 00:15:49.501]  They've now got troops in Afghanistan, troops in Iraq.
[00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:57.847]  The Japanese of course passed a constitution after occupation by Douglas MacArthur that they would not have any offensive military.
[00:15:58.228 --> 00:16:03.152]  But now with Bush's announcement of preemptive strikes, Japan has said that they may even adopt that.
[00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:07.075]  Not just an offensive stance, but a super offensive stance.
[00:16:09.099 --> 00:16:10.860]  So all of this is going on.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.702]  And you have a little mention in the New York Times of, oh, they might develop nuclear weapons.
[00:16:15.802 --> 00:16:16.602]  Yeah, sure.
[00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:23.965]  You think they make the best cars and the best electronics and have the most high-tech nuclear reactors in the world?
[00:16:24.965 --> 00:16:25.726]  How many do they have?
[00:16:25.746 --> 00:16:27.126]  It's a massive number.
[00:16:27.746 --> 00:16:29.247]  I mean, they've got reactors everywhere.
[00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:33.169]  And all sorts of secret facilities, bioweapons facilities.
[00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:36.470]  The Japanese, ladies and gentlemen, are a serious
[00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:42.508]  Ace card for a wild card, really.
[00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:45.269]  A royal flush, a whole hand of cards.
[00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:50.212]  Words cannot describe how highly developed.
[00:16:50.632 --> 00:16:52.793]  They have the most technologically developed country in the world.
[00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:55.914]  They have the most highly educated people in the world.
[00:16:56.175 --> 00:16:59.276]  They have the highest per capita IQ in the world.
[00:16:59.836 --> 00:17:02.678]  And just believe me, folks, they're completely armed to the teeth.
[00:17:02.998 --> 00:17:10.660]  They've been building subs, and cruisers, and all sorts of fighter-bombers, and they've got a huge secret arsenal.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.461]  By the way, I have a family that's been doing business in Europe going back over a decade.
[00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:18.282]  There are huge arsenals the Germans have built.
[00:17:18.722 --> 00:17:20.262]  They have built aircraft carriers.
[00:17:20.302 --> 00:17:22.663]  They have built giant troop-carrying subs.
[00:17:23.203 --> 00:17:25.083]  They've been building all sorts of secret nukes.
[00:17:25.123 --> 00:17:26.584]  Remember, Hitler armed in secret.
[00:17:27.044 --> 00:17:27.764]  No one knew about it.
[00:17:29.093 --> 00:17:33.274]  So, it's just wild arms race going on right now.
[00:17:35.594 --> 00:17:38.455]  And I'll have to tell you, Germany and Japan are not as corrupt.
[00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:51.197]  They may spend a fraction of what our government does, but it's not for $800 toilet seats and $15 million blue tarp tents in Iraq for Halliburton just to feather their nest.
[00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:54.498]  When they spend money over there, it goes into the weapons systems.
[00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:57.402]  So they have very large arsenals now.
[00:17:57.422 --> 00:18:00.004]  Now, I digress off into Japan.
[00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:04.847]  Let me just get into, well, here's another headline here out of Bloomberg.
[00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:10.491]  Japan to respond severely to North Korean missile test and they say they may respond economically, militarily.
[00:18:10.892 --> 00:18:15.775]  They're telling them that this is going to let a very militaristic government take over Japan.
[00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:18.475]  You know, a leopard isn't going to change their spots, folks.
[00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:23.899]  And the Japanese, historically, aren't just smart, they're very militaristic, and they like to attack people.
[00:18:24.159 --> 00:18:25.200]  Let's just be honest about it.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.942]  So go ahead and give them an excuse, you're going to get clobbered, North Korea.
[00:18:28.403 --> 00:18:32.226]  North Korea has already mock-nuked Alaska with U.S.
[00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:32.927]  government help.
[00:18:33.427 --> 00:18:36.870]  New report about threat of missile launch omit defects.
[00:18:38.835 --> 00:18:52.280]  Reports today concerning the completed fueling of North Korea's long-range Taepong Dong-2 missile and its planned launch within a month omit several key aspects of the story, including the fact that North Korea already launched a missile to hit Alaska with the help of the U.S.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.640]  government.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.841]  In March of 2003, the Korean Times reported to the U.S.
[00:18:55.941 --> 00:19:04.024]  National Assembly, including a startling admission in its final report regarding North Korea's missile capabilities.
[00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:07.986]  A nuclear-capable North Korea test warhead was found in Alaska.
[00:19:08.678 --> 00:19:09.499]  According to a U.S.
[00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:16.144]  document, the last piece of the missile, that is the warhead tip casing, was fired by North Korea.
[00:19:16.164 --> 00:19:17.245]  It was found in Alaska.
[00:19:17.265 --> 00:19:27.454]  Former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakama was quoted as saying in a report, Washington as well as Tokyo has so far undeterred North Korea's missile capabilities.
[00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:33.482]  A story that would have expected to garner front page headlines for days was completely blacked out by the U.S.
[00:19:33.522 --> 00:19:35.742]  with not a single newspaper choosing to report it.
[00:19:35.802 --> 00:19:36.362]  The reason?
[00:19:36.923 --> 00:19:38.103]  How could the Bush administration?
[00:19:38.223 --> 00:19:41.863]  Well, we'll tell you the reason on the other side of this break.
[00:19:43.744 --> 00:19:44.264]  That's right!
[00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:49.905]  The United States was hit in 2000.
[00:19:49.965 --> 00:19:55.426]  It was reported in 2003 by the final stage, the warhead casing.
[00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:57.326]  We have been hit
[00:19:58.032 --> 00:19:59.030]  By a dummy missile!

[00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.710]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.611]  Inflation.
[00:21:10.071 --> 00:21:10.751]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.491 --> 00:21:15.472]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:15.492 --> 00:21:17.552]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:17.572 --> 00:21:18.052]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:18.112 --> 00:21:20.173]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:32.810]  Here is reality.
[00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.773]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.253 --> 00:21:40.916]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.476 --> 00:21:45.219]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:22:01.756 --> 00:22:05.017]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:22:05.077 --> 00:22:09.258]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:22:09.518 --> 00:22:12.298]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:22:12.478 --> 00:22:14.879]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:23.721]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:25.261]  The Berkeley light is different.
[00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:29.582]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:30.383]  We're good to go!
[00:22:48.962 --> 00:22:50.605]  Screams and stagnant ponds.

[00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:13.016]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[00:23:13.376 --> 00:23:20.961]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[00:23:21.242 --> 00:23:24.524]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.

[00:23:34.574 --> 00:23:36.134]  A Tornado under your hood!
[00:23:36.274 --> 00:23:42.115]  A Tornado is an easy to install, maintenance free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[00:23:42.435 --> 00:23:49.576]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:54.557]  With today's gas prices it makes sense to cage the gas saving power of a Tornado.
[00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:59.218]  Visit TornadoAir.com or go to Pep Boys, NAPA or AutoZone.
[00:24:01.363 --> 00:24:05.446]  We don't need no education.
[00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.553]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:24:15.874 --> 00:24:16.454]  Welcome back.
[00:24:17.816 --> 00:24:28.984]  So why did the Western press cover up the admitted, confirmed, US government document, South Korean, Japanese documents, that we were hit by a test missile?
[00:24:31.934 --> 00:24:32.214]  Why?
[00:24:33.596 --> 00:24:34.176]  The reason?
[00:24:34.316 --> 00:24:53.295]  How could the Bush administration sell a war against a country with no means to defend itself, and as it later transpired, with no weapons of mass destruction, when a country with WMDs was firing long-range nuclear-capable missiles that were hitting the western coast of the United States?
[00:24:55.764 --> 00:25:08.370]  The 1994 agreed framework deal gave North Korea the capability to generate enough nuclear fuel to produce almost 100 nuclear bombs per year, a 99 congressional study undertaken by the House North Korean Advisory Group warned.
[00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:18.433]  And it went on to the provision of two light water reactors under the 94 agreed framework, and then ABB, the Swiss company, sold it to him, and guess who was on the board?
[00:25:18.813 --> 00:25:19.534]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:38.802]  The United States, through the KEDO, would provide North Korea with the capability to produce annually enough fissile material for nearly 100 nuclear bombs should the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK, decide to violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, which they did do.
[00:25:39.508 --> 00:25:48.396]  In April of 2002, the Bush administration announced that it would release $95 million of American taxpayer dollars to begin construction of the harmless light-water reactors.
[00:25:48.776 --> 00:26:00.166]  Bush argued that arming the megalomaniacal dictator Kim Jong-il with the potential to produce 100 nukes a year was, and they already had enough to make 9 a year before that, vital to the national security interests of the United States.
[00:26:00.566 --> 00:26:05.451]  Bush released even more money in January of 2003, as reported by Bloomberg News.
[00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:14.460]  President George W. Bush is seeking $3.5 million for the international consortium that continues to build two nuclear reactors for North Korea even as the U.S.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.683]  confronts the communist regime over nuclear arms development.
[00:26:18.424 --> 00:26:25.531]  The company that got the contract to deliver equipment and services to build the two light water reactor stations was ABB.
[00:26:26.744 --> 00:26:38.018]  Aza Brown Bovari, which describes itself as a leader in power and automation technologies that enable utility and industry customers to improve performance while lowering environmental impact.
[00:26:38.419 --> 00:26:42.424]  The contract was valued at $200 million and was signed in January of 2000.
[00:26:44.326 --> 00:26:49.710]  It should be no surprise to our old friend, Donald Rumsfeld, was the man who paved the way for the U.S.
[00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:56.935]  companies to sell Iraq chemical and biological weapons in 1983, was the executive director of ABB, not just the board, he was the executive director.
[00:26:57.275 --> 00:27:02.298]  From 2000-2001, while the deal took place, Rumsfeld resigned when he was appointed U.S.
[00:27:02.338 --> 00:27:03.159]  Secretary of Defense.
[00:27:03.679 --> 00:27:11.321]  Wolfram Eberhardt, a spokesman for ABB, confirmed that Rumsfeld was in nearly all the board meetings during the involvement with the company.
[00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:14.502]  The meetings were held quarterly in Zurich, Switzerland.
[00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:26.105]  However, Rumsfeld again displays his uncanny ability to forget things when he stated that he, quote, doesn't remember the issue of North Korea being brought before the ABB board, Swiss Info concluded.
[00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:28.786]  Yeah, he's the executive director, okay?
[00:27:28.826 --> 00:27:29.706]  He is the head
[00:27:30.386 --> 00:27:36.392]  Of the company at the time, and he doesn't know anything about a $200 million deal that was very controversial and all over the news.
[00:27:37.693 --> 00:27:38.634]  It's totally true.
[00:27:38.955 --> 00:27:39.816]  Rumsfeld doesn't lie.
[00:27:39.836 --> 00:27:53.429]  Rumsfeld's position at ABB could prove embarrassing for the Bush administration, since while he was director, he was also active on issues of weapons proliferation, sharing the 98th Congressional Ballistic Missile Threat Commission, reported Swiss Info.
[00:27:54.438 --> 00:28:03.824]  North Korea is controlled by a hierarchy, hereditary Stalinist dictatorship, that has starved two million of its citizens to death in favor of building a two million man army.
[00:28:03.864 --> 00:28:04.964]  That was just in the last ten years.
[00:28:05.364 --> 00:28:08.406]  Some people put the figure at four million, one quarter of the population.
[00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:14.210]  In the far north of the country, there's a network of forced labor gulags, where people have been raped and executed.
[00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.251]  And it goes on and on.
[00:28:17.772 --> 00:28:22.274]  Expressed a bland political opinion are, along with their... Let me go back and read that.
[00:28:22.314 --> 00:28:22.915]  I skipped a line.
[00:28:22.955 --> 00:28:23.615]  It's tiny print.
[00:28:24.673 --> 00:28:25.693]  Trying to hurry through this.
[00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:34.857]  In the far north of the country, there is a network of forced labor gulags where people who have expressed a bland political opinion are, along with their entire families, tortured, raped, and executed.
[00:28:35.177 --> 00:28:38.138]  Horrific biochemical experiments are performed on mass numbers of people.
[00:28:38.458 --> 00:28:41.599]  Babies are delivered and then stamped to death by camp guards.
[00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:42.919]  This is all mainstream news.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.581]  If the mother screams while the guards are stamping on the baby's neck, she's immediately assassinated by a firing squad.
[00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:53.023]  These guards are rewarded with bonuses and promotions for ripping out prisoners' eyeballs.
[00:28:53.863 --> 00:28:57.084]  The North Korean people are enslaved by a government that is using food as a weapon.
[00:28:57.365 --> 00:29:03.867]  Perhaps this is why the EU and the United States, via the UN World Food Program, resumed the shipment of hundreds of thousands of tons of food aid in the end of 2003.
[00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:11.050]  This goes directly to the sitting dictatorship, which then decides who gets it by their level of allegiance to the state.
[00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:16.553]  Food aid only increases the power of Kim Jong-il, the hereditary sack of pus, I would add, and yet it is a
[00:29:17.959 --> 00:29:21.961]  Veiled by the UN in bleeding heart humanitarian rhetoric.
[00:29:22.001 --> 00:29:28.784]  The money goes straight to enabling the North Korean leadership to live a lap of westernized luxury with casinos and lavish new cars.
[00:29:29.304 --> 00:29:40.109]  President Bush publicly claims to loathe Kim Jong-il II and yet his administration, like Bill Clinton before him, has armed North Korea to the teeth with anything up to and beyond 200 nuclear bombs.
[00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.650]  All right.
[00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.791]  Come back, get into Bilderberg.
[00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:45.031]  Shocking report.
[00:29:45.471 --> 00:29:46.492]  Brace yourselves for this.
[00:29:51.798 --> 00:29:54.804]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.726 --> 00:29:58.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.042]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[00:30:06.382 --> 00:30:08.404]  And check this out, I bought a new car.
[00:30:08.504 --> 00:30:13.728]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:30:14.288 --> 00:30:18.431]  www.DidYouRobBillGates.com I did and you were right.
[00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:23.675]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:30:24.075 --> 00:30:26.537]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:30:26.837 --> 00:30:30.160]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.321]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[00:30:31.681 --> 00:30:34.062]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:30:34.422 --> 00:30:36.662]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:30:36.782 --> 00:30:37.462]  It's incredible!
[00:30:37.822 --> 00:30:45.284]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:30:45.624 --> 00:30:50.545]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:51.145 --> 00:30:51.845]  Check, please!
[00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:53.186]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:54.266]  Sure, John.
[00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:59.007]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.

[00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:26.325]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.505 --> 00:31:34.849]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.129 --> 00:31:41.492]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:31:41.612 --> 00:31:46.094]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:33:07.684 --> 00:33:10.967]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:12.909]  That's right, folks.
[00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:13.429]  Don't worry.
[00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:14.350]  The truth will come out.
[00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.370]  Evil will fail.
[00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.352]  The globalists will be exposed.
[00:33:17.372 --> 00:33:18.213]  Just have the courage.
[00:33:18.773 --> 00:33:21.455]  Move forward, educating one man, one woman at a time.
[00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:26.919]  We will, hopefully, if enough people get involved, stop the New World Order.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.301]  Greg Palast is coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:29.722 --> 00:33:33.845]  They have a lot of other international and national news, and this North Korea situation is so incredible.
[00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:52.726]  That we would invade Iraq, we would be talking about invading Iran right now, but meanwhile North Korea threatens to nuke us almost on a weekly basis, China threatens to nuke us every few months, huge press conferences, over a hundred members of the press, the Wall Street Journal, you name it there, but none of these guys are a threat.
[00:33:52.746 --> 00:34:02.715]  Let's give them our ports, give them our bases, give them aid, buy all their products, but we've got to invade these Arab countries because they're pushovers, ladies and gentlemen, comparatively, and because they've got oil.
[00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:08.060]  But before we go any further, let me just get into this email I received.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.461]  We've talked to Joe Byrd.
[00:34:11.341 --> 00:34:12.482]  We've talked to Don McCormick.
[00:34:12.702 --> 00:34:13.862]  This email came from Joe Byrd.
[00:34:13.882 --> 00:34:16.443]  We're going to post this on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:17.503 --> 00:34:25.186]  Alex, I wanted to pass on some information and let you know what happened to us after we met last Friday, directly after your in-car interview with Jim Tucker.
[00:34:25.206 --> 00:34:28.207]  I guess they saw me across the street doing an in-the-car interview with Jim.
[00:34:28.908 --> 00:34:32.950]  Because it was raining outside at the Brook Street Resort at Leggett Drive in Ottawa.
[00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.912]  My name is Joe, and I was with the young lady, Crystal, and another person, Don McCormick.
[00:34:37.552 --> 00:34:41.854]  You had just interviewed Jim, then met with Daniel Estelon and Mark at the site.
[00:34:41.894 --> 00:34:48.158]  We offered you a blowhorn, I guess you'd call that a bullhorn, but you hadn't decided to use one or not at that point.
[00:34:49.098 --> 00:34:49.678]  And it goes on.
[00:34:49.778 --> 00:34:53.000]  Obviously you got yourself one after all, because later I did bullhorn.
[00:34:53.678 --> 00:35:00.163]  Dom was overheard saying something along the lines, if the laws of cause and effect are intact, these buildings should come down.
[00:35:00.843 --> 00:35:03.245]  He was talking about 9-11 folks, everybody was.
[00:35:03.645 --> 00:35:13.513]  Daniel invited us to meet you at the embassy suites that you were staying at that evening to come out for dinner with your entourage and you could obviously would have loved that particular opportunity.
[00:35:13.873 --> 00:35:16.455]  I was exchanging email and phone numbers with your friend Mark.
[00:35:16.995 --> 00:35:20.617]  We left that same afternoon shortly after you left at around 1 p.m.
[00:35:20.657 --> 00:35:37.968]  or so we were followed into downtown core and Don was subsequently surrounded at gunpoint apprehended and taken to a clandestine facility operated by national security without warrant or arrest he was then threatened with violence and other harsh measures interrogated and humiliated after hours of this treatment he was released
[00:35:38.328 --> 00:35:47.212]  During the interrogation, the NSA official, Frank or Francisco, grilled him about his association with you and branded you an insurgent.
[00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.191]  Don was instructed to have no additional contact with yourself and to leave town immediately.
[00:35:52.551 --> 00:35:56.852]  Crystal and I were also taken in while Don was being interrogated, but our experience wasn't so bad.
[00:35:57.172 --> 00:35:58.493]  They asked us questions about Don.
[00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:01.714]  I've known him for two decades and released us after only a few hours.
[00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:07.815]  We were dropped off where the car was, but we were forced to wait in the back of a police cruiser until Don was subsequently dropped off.
[00:36:08.195 --> 00:36:12.396]  Our ordeal started about three-ish and ended about nine-thirty or ten o'clock at night.
[00:36:12.657 --> 00:36:14.297]  We are glad in a sense that
[00:36:14.717 --> 00:36:19.460]  We can talk about this now and nothing changes the fact that we believe in you and your movement more than ever.
[00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:37.632]  We also told you that we would be starting a branch of a movement up here in the North Canadian Patriot Activist Network and it goes on and says Alex, Don said he was willing to go on the record about his ordeal, names, name names and give you an interview and we now have Don with us, Don McCormick.
[00:36:37.972 --> 00:36:38.893]  Don, thanks for coming on.
[00:36:39.617 --> 00:36:40.798]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:46.464]  Tell people a little bit about yourself and your respected guy in business there.
[00:36:46.484 --> 00:36:58.475]  I've been working for Hydro One as an electrician and all types of electrical generation at the province's own utility for over two decades.
[00:37:00.744 --> 00:37:08.747]  The reason I came to Ottawa is I'd seen your website and Alex, the bottom line is the truth is the truth.
[00:37:09.367 --> 00:37:12.228]  It always has been the truth and it always will be the truth.
[00:37:12.488 --> 00:37:13.529]  And what's right is right.
[00:37:14.029 --> 00:37:15.709]  It's always right and always will be right.
[00:37:15.749 --> 00:37:16.830]  Those are two constants.
[00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.791]  The only thing that is permanent other than that is change.
[00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:25.793]  And it's time for the people of Canada and the US and Mexico to wake up.
[00:37:26.593 --> 00:37:28.595]  And inform themselves of the truth.
[00:37:29.035 --> 00:37:31.537]  Now to be clear, you work for the government.
[00:37:31.577 --> 00:37:34.499]  You even work, I believe Kevin was telling me, on nuclear power plants.
[00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:36.700]  You're a mainstream guy with a security clearance.
[00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:40.263]  Now you don't have any record and then suddenly this all happens to you.
[00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:44.206]  Go back for me and describe exactly what happened.
[00:37:44.646 --> 00:37:54.874]  Well, I had been taking a rest in the back of a rental vehicle and it was pouring down rain and then there was a bang on the car saying, wake up and get out of the car.
[00:37:56.036 --> 00:38:02.578]  And, um, so when I woke up and opened the door, there was these officers that had guns pointed at me.
[00:38:02.618 --> 00:38:05.919]  And I've never had a gun pointed at me by a police officer.
[00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:07.320]  Now, is this Ottawa Police?
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.800]  Which police specifically?
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.500]  Well, I don't know.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.501]  It's difficult to tell.
[00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:12.321]  I think it was the RCMP.
[00:38:13.241 --> 00:38:14.662]  So it was Royal Mounted Police.
[00:38:14.722 --> 00:38:15.382]  Federal Police.
[00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:16.022]  Yes.
[00:38:16.382 --> 00:38:16.682]  Alright.
[00:38:16.862 --> 00:38:17.383]  Please continue.
[00:38:18.103 --> 00:38:21.384]  So, um, actually I was in shock.
[00:38:22.304 --> 00:38:23.585]  It was raining down.
[00:38:24.045 --> 00:38:24.745]  I lied down.
[00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:26.029]  I don't think so.
[00:38:50.242 --> 00:38:53.204]  It was a terrifying experience, as you can imagine.
[00:38:53.604 --> 00:38:54.344]  How many hours?
[00:38:54.424 --> 00:38:56.345]  Now, they took you somewhere after that, correct?
[00:38:56.905 --> 00:38:58.306]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:06.749]  From what I can ascertain, they took me to a facility that is rarely used, was their description.
[00:39:06.809 --> 00:39:08.390]  I didn't see a lot of pictures on the wall.
[00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.812]  There was new paint, but the cells weren't cell bar doors.
[00:39:11.892 --> 00:39:17.234]  Like, these were maximum security cells with the full metal door and just a sliver of
[00:39:18.143 --> 00:39:19.644]  Clear plastic to lock in.
[00:39:20.365 --> 00:39:33.433]  Now, like, I want to make it clear that I have a hundred percent respect for the officers of the law, and I know they're just doing their job, but I don't know who would give them orders.
[00:39:34.674 --> 00:39:41.439]  First they said, when they pulled me out of the car, that they had a description of a man matching my description who had a gun.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.882]  And then they arrested me
[00:39:48.673 --> 00:40:00.700]  I want to go back though.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.420]  I want to go back.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:09.165]  Specifically, you described to Kevin in a pre-interview that they took you to some facility that looked like an old building on the outside, but it was new inside.
[00:40:09.185 --> 00:40:11.206]  So was this a secretive type facility?
[00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:11.946]  I mean, where was it?
[00:40:14.299 --> 00:40:22.067]  I understand you're not from the city, I understand you're not in Ottawa, you don't live there, you're visiting, but let me describe, was it near a residential area, near big buildings?
[00:40:22.588 --> 00:40:26.752]  No, I think it was more like in the downtown core.
[00:40:26.832 --> 00:40:31.918]  It was several kilometers away from where they picked me up in the rental vehicle and
[00:40:32.759 --> 00:40:41.184]  I don't not know whether they tailed the vehicle since we left the conference, or whether they used the GPS on start.
[00:40:41.464 --> 00:40:44.366]  Well, Daniel Estolon was stopped, too, and questioned.
[00:40:46.187 --> 00:40:47.588]  So we know this was happening to other people.
[00:40:47.628 --> 00:40:51.090]  We were being tailed off and on, and even got some video of the people.
[00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.212]  But specifically now, they get you to the facility.
[00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:55.172]  Describe that for us.
[00:40:57.378 --> 00:40:59.799]  The only thing that really kills fear is knowledge.
[00:41:00.399 --> 00:41:04.400]  And I didn't know what to think or do.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:20.524]  I've read in various publications that with these new terrorist laws that they seem to have passed without any of the government officials looking at it, more or less, they can hold you indefinitely and without charges.
[00:41:20.824 --> 00:41:24.865]  And, you know, my grandfather fought in the World War
[00:41:25.615 --> 00:41:33.699]  He was injured at Vimy Ridge in the Thawm and I think he'd be appalled and roll over in his grave if he'd seen the type.
[00:41:33.759 --> 00:41:34.880]  Well, I want you to describe this.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.460]  Did they pull you into a parking garage?
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.221]  Where did you park?
[00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:37.981]  What did it look like?
[00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:42.823]  Well, it was like an underground, like, parking facility.
[00:41:43.964 --> 00:41:48.626]  It was very, you could smell the new paint, but it was very empty.
[00:41:48.666 --> 00:41:50.447]  Like, there wasn't a lot of pictures on the wall.
[00:41:50.487 --> 00:41:52.968]  It was just like an underground parking garage.
[00:41:52.988 --> 00:41:54.029]  Did they put you in a cell?
[00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.931]  Yes.
[00:41:55.991 --> 00:41:58.513]  The cell wasn't like a normal cell, though.
[00:41:58.553 --> 00:42:00.715]  It wasn't with the bars coming down.
[00:42:00.775 --> 00:42:04.338]  It was like a maximum security... I understand.
[00:42:04.378 --> 00:42:05.258]  Big steel door.
[00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:05.999]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:07.660]  Did they put down... Let me just guess.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.203]  Did they put you in there for about an hour to freak you out, then pull you out and interrogate you?
[00:42:11.243 --> 00:42:13.725]  Or did they... I mean, tell us blow by blow.
[00:42:14.306 --> 00:42:16.167]  Let me just stop you, because we don't have a lot of time.
[00:42:16.628 --> 00:42:17.468]  I want to get the story.
[00:42:17.728 --> 00:42:19.610]  Specifically, tell us blow by blow what happened.
[00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:28.356]  Well, they put me in the cell for a few hours and then I was called into this interrogation room.
[00:42:28.597 --> 00:42:35.002]  Some of the questions that were asked were, how do you know Alex Jones?
[00:42:35.342 --> 00:42:36.703]  Do you know how many people are with him?
[00:42:36.763 --> 00:42:37.344]  And so on.
[00:42:39.085 --> 00:42:43.749]  They just asked me what I was doing there.
[00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:49.894]  They recommended strongly that I'd be picked up if I went anywhere back near this place.
[00:42:50.473 --> 00:42:56.699]  And the thing is, they also picked up Joe Bird and Crystal Slack, who's only 19 years old.
[00:42:56.799 --> 00:42:59.421]  I knew that they had them in custody.
[00:42:59.562 --> 00:43:01.343]  I just had a gut feeling.
[00:43:01.523 --> 00:43:02.564]  Now, we've talked to them.
[00:43:02.704 --> 00:43:04.947]  I didn't want anything to happen to them.
[00:43:04.967 --> 00:43:09.231]  So I basically just agreed with most of what they said.
[00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:13.414]  I told them I'd never go to another conference again and got the heck out of there.
[00:43:13.955 --> 00:43:15.997]  Now, how many hours were you there?
[00:43:16.998 --> 00:43:18.959]  I'd say about six or seven.
[00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:19.540]  Okay.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:27.884]  Specifically, tell us about this Frank or Francisco grilling you, the threats, the threats of violence.
[00:43:27.904 --> 00:43:28.605]  Can you tell me about that?
[00:43:29.085 --> 00:43:34.288]  Well, Frank wanted to get the information necessary.
[00:43:34.468 --> 00:43:35.889]  He was just... Let me stop you.
[00:43:35.929 --> 00:43:39.671]  Were you being interrogated in the cell or were they taking you out to an interrogation?
[00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:42.252]  I was taken to a different room for that.
[00:43:42.272 --> 00:43:42.853]  Okay.
[00:43:42.893 --> 00:43:43.393]  Describe it.
[00:43:43.413 --> 00:43:44.013]  You're at a table.
[00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:44.754]  How many people in the room?
[00:43:45.325 --> 00:43:46.706]  There was two people in the room.
[00:43:46.766 --> 00:43:48.328]  Was there a table in front of you?
[00:43:48.348 --> 00:43:49.509]  Yes, there was a table.
[00:43:49.529 --> 00:43:51.871]  Were there any recording devices?
[00:43:51.911 --> 00:43:57.456]  Yeah, in the corner there appeared to be a, you know, the filmed camera.
[00:43:57.496 --> 00:43:59.058]  Sure.
[00:43:59.078 --> 00:44:01.199]  Tell us exactly what this Frank person said.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:10.488]  Well, Frank wanted to know about what I was doing in Ottawa while I was at the Bilderberg.
[00:44:11.269 --> 00:44:19.235]  Why I'd been there the night before, what was my relationship with you, how many people were with you, and so on.
[00:44:20.516 --> 00:44:34.426]  Because Joe Bird, in his email to us, and in our talks with him, we're going to get him on too, later, he specifically said that you were threatened, there were threats of violence, that this Frank person said that I was, quote, an insurgent.
[00:44:34.466 --> 00:44:34.986]  Is that true?
[00:44:35.567 --> 00:44:39.650]  Well, I got the impression myself that
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.342]  That was what he was kind of describing you as.
[00:44:44.242 --> 00:44:46.004]  Specifically, what did he say about me?
[00:44:46.964 --> 00:45:03.414]  Well, he wanted to know how I knew you, what I knew about you, and I explained to him about PrisonPlanet.com and some of the websites, because I really believe that you are telling the truth, and I want him to believe that you are telling the truth.
[00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:04.595]  Sure, I understand why you're doing this, sir.
[00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:05.435]  Tell us about Frank.
[00:45:05.455 --> 00:45:06.336]  Tell us what Frank said.
[00:45:07.296 --> 00:45:08.097]  Well, Frank was
[00:45:09.452 --> 00:45:11.653]  Asking a variety of questions.
[00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:12.793]  And how was Frank dressed?
[00:45:14.154 --> 00:45:15.174]  He was in a suit.
[00:45:15.734 --> 00:45:16.575]  Very professional.
[00:45:17.135 --> 00:45:18.015]  Was he wearing a tie?
[00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:18.796]  Yes.
[00:45:19.036 --> 00:45:19.556]  I'm just curious.
[00:45:19.596 --> 00:45:22.157]  He was definitely... How old was he?
[00:45:22.517 --> 00:45:23.798]  Give us a physical description, please.
[00:45:24.038 --> 00:45:28.139]  Well, I'd say he was about 50 years old, perhaps.
[00:45:28.499 --> 00:45:30.020]  Okay, did he say who he was with?
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.122]  He said that he was with the National Integrated
[00:45:35.862 --> 00:45:46.347]  National Security Agency and when I heard international and integrated national security team, that's when I started thinking Posse Pumatatus.
[00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:51.170]  They're integrating the RCMP and the military together in my opinion.
[00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.131]  What else did he specifically say about me?
[00:45:53.171 --> 00:45:55.292]  I'm sorry I'm interrogating you, I'm just trying to get it all out here.
[00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:57.033]  What else did this Frank person say?
[00:46:00.231 --> 00:46:08.222]  He said things to me like it'd be better if I did more sleeping than talking on the way home, as if, you know, they'd be listening to me.
[00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:13.029]  And I have to choose my words here very carefully, Alex.
[00:46:14.969 --> 00:46:19.233]  I hate to say this in the darkness here in Canada, but I'm looking over my shoulder from time to time now.
[00:46:19.434 --> 00:46:22.116]  Hey, that's what the secret police thing is all about.
[00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:23.317]  I understand your courage.
[00:46:23.678 --> 00:46:26.260]  You have incredible courage, Don, coming on, but you're doing the right thing.
[00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:27.582]  You've done nothing wrong.
[00:46:28.322 --> 00:46:32.006]  Now, I guess you guys were out front talking about 9-11.
[00:46:32.026 --> 00:46:33.868]  Is that what they claim they heard?
[00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:38.811]  We're good to go.
[00:46:57.444 --> 00:46:59.225]  And that's what the Canadian...
[00:47:16.415 --> 00:47:17.876]  And by the way, I don't agree with that, folks.
[00:47:19.177 --> 00:47:20.297]  I'm showing you what it would have looked like.
[00:47:20.617 --> 00:47:33.084]  The minute somebody would have agreed or just jokingly laughed, boom, it would have been national headlines, Alex Jones the terrorist, he's facing 20 years in prison, they torture me, if I agreed to plea bargain, they'd only give me a year in prison.
[00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:34.825]  I'd be in prison right now.
[00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:37.006]  Folks, that's how serious
[00:47:37.626 --> 00:47:39.307]  This is when you're dealing with these people.
[00:47:39.367 --> 00:47:43.789]  Now, I want to go back to Joe Bird's description here in this reporting sentence.
[00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.471]  Were there threats to you physically?
[00:47:49.692 --> 00:47:51.834]  I cannot really say.
[00:47:53.915 --> 00:47:57.076]  It was more of a mental thing.
[00:47:57.296 --> 00:48:00.778]  Like, if you go here, we'll be picking you up.
[00:48:00.938 --> 00:48:01.879]  You won't be let go.
[00:48:02.581 --> 00:48:08.103]  And as far as I do more sleeping than talking on the way home is if they're listening to what I say.
[00:48:08.604 --> 00:48:14.266]  You know, psychological terror is a lot harder to heal than physical.
[00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:17.688]  Now think, did Frank say anything else about myself?
[00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:28.792]  You know Alex, the whole thing is so fast and so, like I was in shock.
[00:48:30.703 --> 00:48:50.534]  I'm scanning through my mind, but you did want to know how many people were in your quote-unquote entourage, and what... Well, we talked about... My major concern was this smart borders thing, which all Canadians should be concerned about, and the effect of the Patriot Act on smart borders.
[00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:58.319]  And when I start reading things like, if you believe in the second coming of Christ, or if you're a Christian, that you could be branded a terrorist, that's...
[00:48:59.273 --> 00:49:00.474]  So you started telling him that?
[00:49:00.514 --> 00:49:01.135]  What did he say?
[00:49:01.415 --> 00:49:03.577]  Yeah, well he said that all this was not true.
[00:49:03.597 --> 00:49:10.643]  Oh, we have the official documents and FEMA on video and training manuals from Virginia to Texas to Arizona.
[00:49:10.984 --> 00:49:12.385]  No, we're not making any of it up.
[00:49:12.765 --> 00:49:17.389]  No, I studied your work too and on the seismograph readings from Oklahoma City.
[00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.552]  So basically he said that I was a liar?
[00:49:21.353 --> 00:49:22.334]  He said that, yes.
[00:49:23.764 --> 00:49:24.805]  What did he specifically say?
[00:49:24.825 --> 00:49:25.765]  I don't want to put words in your mouth.
[00:49:25.785 --> 00:49:28.267]  What did he specifically say about me concerning that?
[00:49:28.287 --> 00:49:29.148]  He said it wasn't true.
[00:49:29.588 --> 00:49:43.677]  That the Smart Borders Patriot Act does not apply in Canada, and that that is wrong, and that believing in... That's been in USA Today that we're merging our border systems.
[00:49:44.017 --> 00:49:44.337]  Yes.
[00:49:44.457 --> 00:49:51.882]  Well, I've been in the construction industry, and even in 1992 when they had these free trade agreements signed,
[00:49:52.686 --> 00:49:55.847]  That was the beginning of the end there, and even before that.
[00:49:55.867 --> 00:49:58.648]  Any other key things he said, Mr. McCormick?
[00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:02.049]  Not that I feel comfortable.
[00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:05.611]  You've got to understand my position.
[00:50:05.631 --> 00:50:06.471]  I understand.
[00:50:06.511 --> 00:50:07.231]  You work for the government.
[00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:09.772]  How many people were in the facility?
[00:50:10.973 --> 00:50:17.815]  As far as I know, there was one person behind the desk, the two officers that escorted me in.
[00:50:18.487 --> 00:50:20.989]  And then he came in later.
[00:50:21.369 --> 00:50:32.437]  But that's why Joe has informed me a lot about your work and I've learned from other sources.
[00:50:32.817 --> 00:50:33.718]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:50:33.978 --> 00:50:35.219]  What color was the paint?
[00:50:36.219 --> 00:50:36.520]  Gray.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:37.620]  Dark gray.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.341]  I knew it.
[00:50:38.501 --> 00:50:39.442]  I was going to say gray.
[00:50:39.782 --> 00:50:41.323]  It's all meant for intimidation.
[00:50:41.403 --> 00:50:42.063]  Dark blue.
[00:50:43.584 --> 00:50:44.365]  Like a navy blue.
[00:50:44.885 --> 00:50:46.106]  It's all for intimidation.
[00:50:46.146 --> 00:50:46.967]  All for darkness.
[00:50:47.615 --> 00:50:48.155]  I didn't see you.
[00:50:48.175 --> 00:50:49.136]  Before I ever talked to you, I knew.
[00:50:49.156 --> 00:50:52.217]  A couple hours in the cell, gray walls.
[00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:55.278]  You were probably at a torture facility, brother.
[00:50:55.298 --> 00:50:57.079]  It's probably where they fly people out.
[00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:58.059]  To the death camps.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:58.920]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.260]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.542 --> 00:51:09.789]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:09.989 --> 00:51:12.331]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[00:51:12.931 --> 00:51:21.779]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:51:22.299 --> 00:51:25.820]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:47.028]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:51:47.388 --> 00:51:51.109]  I'll also be debuting my exclusive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:51:51.749 --> 00:52:03.436]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.556 --> 00:52:07.678]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.778 --> 00:52:10.679]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.759 --> 00:52:17.423]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.643 --> 00:52:20.627]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.848 --> 00:52:23.231]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:33.526]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[00:52:33.706 --> 00:52:42.850]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:50.754]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:50.774 --> 00:52:51.214]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.274 --> 00:52:52.975]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:03.250]  I think so.
[00:53:18.155 --> 00:53:18.815]  We're good to go!
[00:53:33.703 --> 00:53:40.404]  For a limited time, you can sign up on the website and receive our 104-page catalog and a current Herbal Healer newsletter free.
[00:53:40.765 --> 00:53:42.845]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[00:53:43.025 --> 00:53:47.466]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[00:53:47.686 --> 00:53:50.767]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:56.788]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:08.962 --> 00:54:12.883]  The conference will sell out by the end of this broadcast today.
[00:54:12.923 --> 00:54:22.066]  We're pulling the ad right now off of the network because we're just a few tickets away from selling out the conference.
[00:54:22.186 --> 00:54:24.786]  I've warned everybody, there'll be no tickets at the door.
[00:54:25.687 --> 00:54:33.649]  You have got just a few hours maximum, maybe pull before then, to get tickets by visiting InfoWars.com
[00:54:35.575 --> 00:54:39.577]  In fact, we've already instructed the toll-free number that they can't take ticket orders now.
[00:54:40.078 --> 00:54:41.679]  That was cut off a few minutes ago.
[00:54:42.239 --> 00:54:48.582]  You can only go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get your tickets right now to the 9-11 conference.
[00:54:48.602 --> 00:54:55.686]  It's going to be like none other in L.A., downtown Sheraton, this coming Saturday and Sunday.
[00:54:56.507 --> 00:54:57.587]  Going back to Don McCormick.
[00:54:57.828 --> 00:54:59.529]  Don, I know it sounds like I'm interrogating you.
[00:54:59.549 --> 00:55:01.630]  We just have limited time and I wanted to get all the answers.
[00:55:03.578 --> 00:55:24.311]  And that's why Joe has put up CPAN, so that other Canadians can join a peaceful information network on the web, because violence is just an attempt to gain control of a situation you don't have control of, and we don't need that because we are in control of the truth.
[00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:26.973]  Don, if you want to plug that website, tell us about it.
[00:55:27.733 --> 00:55:28.494]  Give us the web address.
[00:55:30.982 --> 00:55:37.783]  I'm not sure if I have the address here, but I believe it'll be on the press release.
[00:55:38.383 --> 00:55:41.604]  It'll be actually the TruthMovement.ca.
[00:55:42.124 --> 00:55:43.364]  TruthMovement.ca.
[00:55:43.504 --> 00:55:44.604]  Okay.
[00:55:44.624 --> 00:55:46.565]  Let me go back here now for just a second.
[00:55:46.985 --> 00:55:49.005]  Number one, anything else you want to add?
[00:55:49.065 --> 00:55:53.866]  And then my final question, was this not a wake-up call to you about just how real this is?
[00:55:54.866 --> 00:55:57.867]  I was astounded.
[00:55:58.587 --> 00:55:59.607]  Like, I've never been
[00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:04.595]  I've been looking into that with my lawyers, but I've been told not to comment on that at this point.
[00:56:24.751 --> 00:56:26.832]  Anything else that happened while you were in the facility?
[00:56:26.872 --> 00:56:29.674]  When they let you go, did they just bring you back to your car?
[00:56:29.714 --> 00:56:35.357]  Well, they drove me back to the rental vehicle, but like I said, they had two of my friends in custody as well.
[00:56:35.817 --> 00:56:37.558]  Just for being my friends.
[00:56:37.818 --> 00:56:38.118]  That's right.
[00:56:38.178 --> 00:56:44.761]  They let them go earlier than you, and they had to wait there where the two cars were, according to their email and the discussions we had.
[00:56:45.082 --> 00:56:46.162]  So they brought you back to the car?
[00:56:46.182 --> 00:56:51.305]  The whole ordeal lasted more towards 11 o'clock, for like 8 hours, to tell you the truth.
[00:56:51.405 --> 00:56:53.546]  What was the last thing they said to you when they let you go?
[00:56:54.292 --> 00:57:05.695]  Well, one of the last things in the interrogation room was, if I was you, I would not go down near the Brook Street Hotel, because if you're picked up again, you will not be getting let go.
[00:57:06.216 --> 00:57:11.557]  And if I was you, I'd do more sleeping and less talking on your way home.
[00:57:11.677 --> 00:57:15.238]  What does that mean, you're not going to be let go?
[00:57:15.278 --> 00:57:16.339]  Did you ask him what that meant?
[00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:20.260]  No, but I got, in my opinion, that would be
[00:57:21.147 --> 00:57:31.489]  Like I say, knowledge kills fear, and the fear of not knowing how long they can hold you, and how long they can hold you without charging you.
[00:57:31.529 --> 00:57:36.950]  Yeah, he was telling you you could be disappeared, and we know they have these holding facilities in every major city.
[00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:49.513]  We know there have been flights out of Canada, out of D.C., out of New York, hundreds of them, even using Red Sox planes, they even rent them, to fly, I'm not kidding folks, to fly people to these former Eastern Bloc gulags.
[00:57:50.629 --> 00:58:02.355]  So, this is chilling, but it shows that their tyranny isn't full power yet, or that those guys might not have, you know, be totally wicked yet, that they didn't do something to you, or they thought it would make a major incident.
[00:58:03.455 --> 00:58:14.761]  Yeah, well I have no criminal record, and for this to happen to an average tax-paying voting Canadian citizen is not right.
[00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:17.622]  Did they ask you over and over again if you were planning something violent?
[00:58:18.422 --> 00:58:21.964]  Well, yeah.
[00:58:22.024 --> 00:58:24.545]  They also took my picture on the way out.
[00:58:24.565 --> 00:58:26.926]  They wanted to know what your purpose was and what I thought you were doing.
[00:58:41.303 --> 00:58:46.148]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.168 --> 00:58:46.629]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:47.549]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:53.856]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:54.036 --> 00:58:56.218]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.196 --> 00:59:05.077]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.097 --> 00:59:09.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.939 --> 00:59:14.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:23.625]  Coming up in the next segment, Greg Hamlisch, best-selling author, documentary filmmaker, BBC Newsnight investigative reporter, will be in studio with us.
[00:59:24.146 --> 00:59:30.909]  Don McCormick and Joe Bird, and of course, Joe Bird's girlfriend, were picked up
[00:59:32.228 --> 00:59:39.231]  And Don was interrogated severely and told that he would not be getting back out if he went back down to the Bilderberg group where they were meeting.
[00:59:40.211 --> 00:59:41.612]  And they were very interested in myself.
[00:59:41.772 --> 00:59:45.833]  Of course, they had provocateurs there and then others that would pick up the provocateur chant.
[00:59:45.933 --> 00:59:47.754]  And I saw police waiting to pounce.
[00:59:48.114 --> 00:59:54.476]  The minute I would have agreed or said anything that could be construed as a threat, I would be in a prison right now.
[00:59:55.157 --> 00:59:58.358]  Because I'm a public figure, I wouldn't have probably gone to an overseas torture center.
[00:59:59.073 --> 01:00:01.575]  But I would be in jail, it would be big headlines right now.
[01:00:01.995 --> 01:00:05.118]  We wrote the article last week, we weren't joking about that.
[01:00:05.158 --> 01:00:06.619]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:00:07.639 --> 01:00:09.160]  And this is all meant to scare everybody.
[01:00:09.221 --> 01:00:11.422]  All the NSA spying announcements, all of it.
[01:00:11.682 --> 01:00:12.503]  It doesn't scare me.
[01:00:12.823 --> 01:00:15.345]  You should be scared of not taking action against these people.
[01:00:15.825 --> 01:00:18.968]  You know, I told Customs when they held me off and on for 15 hours.
[01:00:19.388 --> 01:00:20.389]  I told them why I was there.
[01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:21.169]  I was there to cover it.
[01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:22.610]  I was there to report on it.
[01:00:22.891 --> 01:00:23.931]  And I was there to expose it.
[01:00:24.232 --> 01:00:24.752]  And I did that.
[01:00:26.325 --> 01:00:31.528]  And I mean what I say, and I said what I meant, and an elephant's faithful 100%.
[01:00:31.748 --> 01:00:45.594]  I mean, I told these people what I was there for, period, and it shows how elitist the Bilderberg Group is, it shows their power, it shows how they can pull strings, it shows what they can do.
[01:00:45.974 --> 01:00:47.454]  This is the real shadow government.
[01:00:47.755 --> 01:00:52.817]  In closing, Don McCormick, I want to commend you for your courage to come on and expose this and talk about this.
[01:00:53.897 --> 01:00:56.960]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'd just like to thank you for letting me get this story out.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:01.563]  I feel safer knowing that if anything does happen to me, that maybe this might have something to do with it.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:30.602]  I don't mean to be paranoid, but after what I've seen in Canada here, I just don't know what to think.
[01:01:30.722 --> 01:01:35.063]  And I really appreciate your courage as well, because without you, I would not know what I know.
[01:01:35.683 --> 01:01:36.503]  Knowledge is power.
[01:01:36.923 --> 01:01:37.283]  It is.
[01:01:37.623 --> 01:01:38.663]  Don, stay in touch.
[01:01:38.703 --> 01:01:40.624]  If they give you any more problems, we'll be here for you.
[01:01:40.644 --> 01:01:41.604]  You've got our office number.
[01:01:41.624 --> 01:01:42.084]  God bless.
[01:01:42.764 --> 01:01:43.404]  Okay, thank you.
[01:01:43.444 --> 01:01:44.185]  God bless you, too.
[01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:44.845]  Bye-bye.
[01:01:44.965 --> 01:01:49.586]  There's an electrician, works for the dams, works for the nuclear power plants.
[01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:50.966]  No criminal record.
[01:01:51.801 --> 01:01:57.383]  Middle-aged fellow, family guy, and he just goes out there with some friends to, you know, check out what's happening.
[01:01:58.063 --> 01:02:01.484]  And they're listening carefully to anyone the same thing they can grab them.
[01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:04.325]  Of course, the provocateurs can stand there and say whatever they want.
[01:02:05.706 --> 01:02:06.186]  That's fine.
[01:02:06.206 --> 01:02:08.087]  You know, they're allowed to sit there and shoot their mouths off.
[01:02:08.907 --> 01:02:12.628]  You see, I told you we were crossing a line when I stood up in Bolharn, Bilderberg.
[01:02:12.668 --> 01:02:14.849]  I knew it consciously and in my bones.
[01:02:15.509 --> 01:02:16.750]  But we've got to be bold.
[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:17.790]  We've got to be strong.
[01:02:18.661 --> 01:02:38.046]  So, if I fall and bump my head, or an 18-wheeler runs over me, or I die suddenly of a heart attack, or some two-week cancer, or I get found dead in a hotel room with heroin needles sticking out of my arms, with a prostitute cut up, you know it isn't true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:38.066 --> 01:02:39.986]  And people go, man, Alex, you've got courage!
[01:02:40.026 --> 01:02:40.527]  Look at this!
[01:02:40.547 --> 01:02:43.507]  No, I don't have courage, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:46.288]  We have a pack of psychopathic criminals.
[01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:51.291]  In control of our country and the world, who think they're going to get away with all this.
[01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:53.232]  They put all these poisons in the vaccines.
[01:02:53.592 --> 01:02:57.874]  The DU, John Yoo, one of the chief White House counsels, says they can torture little kids.
[01:02:58.214 --> 01:03:00.515]  I mean, you've got to stand up against them!
[01:03:01.535 --> 01:03:03.496]  They're going to have their way with us if we don't.
[01:03:03.976 --> 01:03:05.457]  And we are having an effect.
[01:03:05.737 --> 01:03:06.857]  We have discredited them.
[01:03:07.157 --> 01:03:10.019]  Their approval ratings are at 30%, in some cases even lower.
[01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:13.480]  Their agenda is unpopular, unconstitutional, and tyrannical.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.902]  So, if more of us stand up, they can't get us all.
[01:03:16.942 --> 01:03:18.083]  And people are standing up.
[01:03:18.523 --> 01:03:21.645]  A lot of the police and intelligence agency people are on our side.
[01:03:21.986 --> 01:03:22.946]  They've counted the cost.
[01:03:22.986 --> 01:03:24.267]  They know we're the good guys.
[01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.569]  They know their bosses are the bad guys.
[01:03:27.089 --> 01:03:31.233]  All we were there in Canada doing was exposing the global mafia.
[01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:31.833]  Period.
[01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.055]  That's all we were doing.
[01:03:34.555 --> 01:03:35.776]  We'll continue to do that.
[01:03:37.034 --> 01:03:43.459]  These Malthusian social Darwinistic crooks that want to build this world government will be defeated.
[01:03:43.799 --> 01:03:44.900]  We'll come back with Greg Powell.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.801]  It's an honor to have him in studio with us.
[01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:48.222]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:48.262 --> 01:03:50.324]  PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[01:03:50.544 --> 01:03:50.964]  Check them out.
[01:03:53.346 --> 01:03:57.669]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.869 --> 01:04:02.313]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.453 --> 01:04:06.816]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.856 --> 01:04:08.237]  The New World Order?
[01:04:09.017 --> 01:04:09.318]  Hammered!
[01:04:09.999 --> 01:04:14.224]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:21.212]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.352 --> 01:04:23.355]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.715 --> 01:04:34.163]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.343 --> 01:04:39.727]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:03.093 --> 01:05:14.341]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:20.386]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:27.270]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:34.295]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.575 --> 01:05:36.356]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.

[01:05:53.038 --> 01:05:55.380]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.662]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:57.802 --> 01:06:04.869]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:06:05.129 --> 01:06:13.697]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:58.124]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.484 --> 01:07:00.746]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:16.808 --> 01:07:18.609]  Well, we're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:26.074]  Now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into this second hour, and I've had a chance to meet him in New York, interview him for my film, Martial Law.
[01:07:26.094 --> 01:07:27.615]  He was gracious enough to give us a few hours then.
[01:07:28.215 --> 01:07:34.362]  And I've had him on the radio with us many, many times over the years breaking big stories that he's always gracious enough to bring us.
[01:07:34.823 --> 01:07:39.788]  And he was here over the weekend speaking to a standing room only crowd about his new book.
[01:07:39.808 --> 01:07:42.812]  It just came out and is already on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:07:42.872 --> 01:07:47.237]  It's Greg Pallast's armed madhouse who's afraid of Osama Wolf.
[01:07:47.857 --> 01:07:53.822]  China Floats, Bush Sinks, The Scheme to Steal 08, No Child Behind Left.
[01:07:53.922 --> 01:07:56.323]  And it also is a handsome book.
[01:07:56.804 --> 01:07:59.005]  I just got it, and I can't wait to read it.
[01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:03.849]  Greg is an extremely accomplished writer, again, best-selling author.
[01:08:04.169 --> 01:08:09.673]  Joining us in studio, we're also videotaping this for the local TV show and the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:11.334]  Greg Powell, it's great to have you here with us.
[01:08:11.514 --> 01:08:12.555]  Terrific, Alex.
[01:08:12.775 --> 01:08:13.616]  It's always an honor.
[01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:14.476]  Really.
[01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:21.882]  I mean, you know, my big shot publishers out of New York, I say, I want to launch my book on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:21.922 --> 01:08:23.443]  And they go, what's Alex Jones?
[01:08:23.463 --> 01:08:25.445]  You know, like they're in the New York Towers.
[01:08:25.465 --> 01:08:27.646]  They don't understand what the people are listening to.
[01:08:27.927 --> 01:08:30.949]  So that's why even they are surprised that my book is a bestseller again.
[01:08:32.572 --> 01:08:34.934]  So thank you, Alex, because you're getting that word out.
[01:08:35.054 --> 01:08:35.954]  Oh, no, thank you, Greg.
[01:08:35.974 --> 01:08:39.856]  You certainly have a huge grassroots support all over the globe.
[01:08:40.196 --> 01:08:42.578]  Tell us about Armed Madhouse.
[01:08:42.838 --> 01:08:45.559]  Well, I mean, it starts out like Who's Afraid of Osama?
[01:08:46.019 --> 01:08:54.644]  You go from the war on terror to Iraq to Venezuela to China and what's going on with all the stuff.
[01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:56.625]  What I'm doing is, for those who don't know me, I do
[01:08:57.828 --> 01:09:08.093]  Investigative reporting for BBC television, which, you know, Alex, I have to do over there because investigative reporting here is, I think, against Patriot Act 3 or something.
[01:09:08.453 --> 01:09:10.074]  They don't allow this stuff on the air.
[01:09:10.094 --> 01:09:22.300]  What I've got here, for example, are the secret plans for the oil fields of Iraq, which I was able to get out of Houston, which are written for the Iraqi government, imposed by the State Department, but written up by big oil.
[01:09:23.018 --> 01:09:33.304]  I've got here the inside documents from Choice Point and the companies which are illegally, you know, sucking up information about you and me and renting it out to the government.
[01:09:34.505 --> 01:09:45.071]  So you have like 60 illustrations in this beast because it's all these documents marked secret and confidential you're not supposed to see and BBC will actually allow me to go get them but they won't allow me to show it on U.S.
[01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:45.392]  TV.
[01:09:45.512 --> 01:09:49.254]  I am completely totally locked out of American television.
[01:09:49.614 --> 01:09:52.717]  Well, this is smoking gun type stuff that you have.
[01:09:52.737 --> 01:09:55.059]  You've done a lot of the original research on this.
[01:09:55.119 --> 01:09:55.899]  It's been confirmed.
[01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:56.640]  It's been vetted.
[01:09:57.361 --> 01:10:03.706]  This is the same stuff that the Treasury Secretary O'Neill was telling us that you actually get the documents.
[01:10:03.846 --> 01:10:05.848]  This is war profiteering in the extreme.
[01:10:06.388 --> 01:10:10.711]  It's a serious crime, in my opinion, and historically we have that precedent.
[01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:22.858]  You have the oil companies writing up the oil policy for the Iraqi government to basically then hand it over to them, proving that one of the pillars of this invasion is about snatching trillions of dollars in oil.
[01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:23.819]  And controlling it.
[01:10:23.879 --> 01:10:27.361]  See, one of the weird things is, and one of the horrible things is, I've got two documents.
[01:10:29.162 --> 01:10:38.526]  Conspiracy nuts think that Bush had a secret plan to seize and control the oil fields of Iraq before the invasion and even before September 11th.
[01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:43.608]  And that's not true, Alex, because I looked it up and we dug it out and we found out he had two plans.
[01:10:44.409 --> 01:10:52.252]  And the two plans, one written up by neocons, one written up by big oil, and the big oil plan, which is the one that ultimately won out
[01:10:53.217 --> 01:10:55.558]  It's not about, believe it or not, it's not about going to get the oil.
[01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:57.779]  It's not about blood for oil, it's about blood for no oil.
[01:10:57.819 --> 01:11:01.340]  They're not going in there to get you the oil to make it cheap to fill your Hummer.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.001]  They are going in.
[01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:11.624]  They're using the 82nd Airborne as Exxon's Exploration Company, not to find oil and bring it back, but to find oil and turn off the spigots.
[01:11:11.884 --> 01:11:13.664]  You read, I have a 320 three-page document.
[01:11:15.911 --> 01:11:21.601]  Written up by Big Oil and the James Baker III Institute Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:11:21.641 --> 01:11:23.865]  I know that a lot of people say, oh, this is conspiracy stuff.
[01:11:24.325 --> 01:11:25.087]  You have to understand.
[01:11:26.096 --> 01:11:34.058]  I found out these guys wrote up our policy because they told me themselves, the oil execs themselves, and the James Baker people.
[01:11:34.078 --> 01:11:40.120]  If you don't know who James Baker is, he was Secretary of State under Bush 1, Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:47.641]  He represents, he's the lawyer for Exxon Mobil, the lawyer for the Saudi Arabian government, and the lawyer kind of consigliere for the Bush family.
[01:11:48.502 --> 01:11:51.322]  And it's his crew that put this together.
[01:11:51.642 --> 01:11:53.563]  Now they say that they didn't put it together,
[01:11:54.517 --> 01:11:56.058]  Or they said they didn't even talk to me.
[01:11:57.059 --> 01:12:00.681]  And they threatened to sue, by the way, Harper's Magazine when I outed this stuff.
[01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.623]  Then the editor of Harper's said, you never talk to Palace?
[01:12:03.663 --> 01:12:04.303]  I said, that's right.
[01:12:04.524 --> 01:12:06.525]  They said, OK, what part of this audio tape is not you?
[01:12:07.225 --> 01:12:08.226]  Because that's one thing I do.
[01:12:08.246 --> 01:12:17.092]  Now, I was on National Public Radio, NPR, which is better called National Petroleum Radio, and they said, we don't do that.
[01:12:18.032 --> 01:12:18.793]  I said, I know that.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.221]  But I have to.
[01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:20.881]  You know what?
[01:12:21.382 --> 01:12:22.843]  You talk to these guys, they lie.
[01:12:22.963 --> 01:12:26.245]  So they didn't know who they were talking to or why, and they let the stuff out.
[01:12:26.786 --> 01:12:34.812]  When I got the word about the oil companies drafting up the plans for Iraq's oil fields right out of Houston, even though it says Washington on it.
[01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:39.556]  First of all, by the way, the United States government told me in writing, when I say me, BBC television.
[01:12:40.077 --> 01:12:42.298]  They told us in writing there is no such plan.
[01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:49.044]  Defense Department, State Department, White House, in writing, there is no plan for the Iraqi oil industry that we've written.
[01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:51.491]  Then, I get the plan.
[01:12:51.511 --> 01:12:52.471]  323 pages.
[01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:53.652]  Mark State Department.
[01:12:53.812 --> 01:12:55.172]  Not for public distribution.
[01:12:55.853 --> 01:12:58.274]  Not confidential to whole nine yards.
[01:12:59.254 --> 01:13:03.796]  And I got that by wiring up and talking to the oil execs who described it and I was able to get my hands on it.
[01:13:04.517 --> 01:13:06.438]  But, here's the evil thing of what's in it.
[01:13:07.298 --> 01:13:11.700]  Bad enough that you got oil company executives writing a policy attached to an Abrams tank.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.620]  And we got kids out there.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.301]  We got now two kids being held hostage.
[01:13:14.441 --> 01:13:15.142]  One out of Houston.
[01:13:15.502 --> 01:13:15.702]  Right?
[01:13:16.342 --> 01:13:18.003]  And believe me, the kid from Houston
[01:13:19.204 --> 01:13:19.964]  Who's held hostage.
[01:13:19.984 --> 01:13:21.685]  Doesn't have anything to do with writing up these oil plans.
[01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:26.127]  The oil plans are about... Here's the phrase in it.
[01:13:26.147 --> 01:13:26.667]  You'll love this.
[01:13:27.887 --> 01:13:32.309]  The purpose is to, quote, enhance Iraq's relationship with OPEC.
[01:13:32.429 --> 01:13:39.872]  Guys, OPEC is the oil cartel, which is squeezing us by the pumps, destroying our economy, raising the price of oil to 70 bucks a barrel.
[01:13:39.892 --> 01:13:42.093]  That's three bucks a gallon at the pump.
[01:13:42.993 --> 01:13:45.054]  Enhance OPEC.
[01:13:46.114 --> 01:13:48.455]  And just so you know, when you talk about crime, Alex,
[01:13:49.577 --> 01:13:54.463]  You have to understand, it is against the law for any American to participate in the oil cartel.
[01:13:54.803 --> 01:13:55.624]  In any cartel.
[01:13:56.185 --> 01:13:56.445]  Okay?
[01:13:58.047 --> 01:14:07.517]  King Abdullah gets away with having a cartel because, you know, there's an exception to American law saying, you know, that apparently that, you know, dictators and bathrobes and crowns are not part of
[01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:10.245]  They're not subject to our laws on monopolies.
[01:14:10.265 --> 01:14:17.489]  Yeah, the foreign governments who have kings, they're allowed to have monopolies, but in the U.S., going back to 1906 and the Sherman Antitrust Act, you can't do that.
[01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:18.050]  That's right.
[01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:23.213]  In fact, there's something called the Long Arm of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which says that any monopoly anywhere, including OPEC,
[01:14:23.951 --> 01:14:25.972]  Is against the US law.
[01:14:26.392 --> 01:14:29.954]  If any American is found helping out OPEC.
[01:14:29.994 --> 01:14:35.297]  Now of course the oil companies are cranking it in big time because of OPEC and they pretend to have nothing to do with it.
[01:14:35.597 --> 01:14:43.841]  But now we have a document showing that the James Baker people and the oil companies that worked with them like Petromina out of Indonesia for example was in on it.
[01:14:44.682 --> 01:14:48.304]  That these guys are using their own phrase.
[01:14:48.344 --> 01:14:49.744]  That they're enhancing OPEC.
[01:14:49.764 --> 01:14:52.966]  That they're trying to maneuver Iraq to make sure that Iraq will never bust
[01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:55.343]  The Saudi Arabian production quotas.
[01:14:56.163 --> 01:14:58.144]  Saudi Arabia sets quotas.
[01:14:58.184 --> 01:15:02.005]  You can't produce more oil than 3 million barrels a day for Iraq.
[01:15:02.145 --> 01:15:04.186]  That's their absolute stone limit.
[01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:08.388]  Now a lot of people I know think that George Bush screwed up in Iraq.
[01:15:08.548 --> 01:15:17.692]  You read his documents you realize he hasn't because you know when he came to office oil was 20 something a barrel like cheaper than peanut butter.
[01:15:18.132 --> 01:15:18.452]  Today
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.580]  It's 70 bucks a barrel.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.841]  That's mission accomplished.
[01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:23.921]  You read this stuff, that was their mission.
[01:15:24.122 --> 01:15:24.802]  Mission accomplished.
[01:15:25.822 --> 01:15:28.743]  Greg, let me add something to what you just said, because this is incredible.
[01:15:28.883 --> 01:15:33.425]  You know, obviously I've read your last two books, I've watched your Bush Family Fortunes video, it's excellent.
[01:15:33.965 --> 01:15:37.686]  But the things you're saying here, I mean, this is the documents, this is the evidence.
[01:15:37.906 --> 01:15:40.027]  You've gotten IMF, World Bank documents in the past.
[01:15:40.087 --> 01:15:42.888]  I want to revisit some of that because it ties in.
[01:15:44.657 --> 01:15:49.421]  But the neocons get on talk radio and go, look, less oil is flowing out of Iraq.
[01:15:49.941 --> 01:15:50.281]  See?
[01:15:50.301 --> 01:15:52.003]  If we wanted the oil, it'd be flowing.
[01:15:52.083 --> 01:15:52.483]  No, no, no, no.
[01:15:52.523 --> 01:15:54.264]  It's called artificial scarcity.
[01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:55.746]  You got it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:55.826 --> 01:15:58.568]  And it's the same thing De Beers and the Oppenheimers do with diamonds.
[01:15:59.128 --> 01:16:06.374]  They go all over the world buying up the fields, paying people off, sending in mercenaries, bragging about it, because they're actually only semi-precious.
[01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:08.896]  They artificially make them scarce.
[01:16:08.956 --> 01:16:10.157]  And it's the same thing with Iraq.
[01:16:10.197 --> 01:16:10.457]  In fact,
[01:16:11.098 --> 01:16:15.283]  In 1990, they were angry, OPEC, Bush Sr.
[01:16:15.323 --> 01:16:22.852]  and others, Europe was angry that Saddam was, quote, overproducing, driving oil prices down because he said, hey, I've got a
[01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:27.072]  30-something billion dollar debt to BCCI and other people.
[01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:28.253]  I've got to pay this off.
[01:16:28.754 --> 01:16:31.115]  OPEC said you're driving it down to 90 cents a gallon.
[01:16:31.435 --> 01:16:32.476]  You can't do this.
[01:16:32.836 --> 01:16:33.737]  So they shut him up.
[01:16:33.777 --> 01:16:35.138]  He said, okay, well, they're slant drilling.
[01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:35.778]  Can I invade them?
[01:16:35.819 --> 01:16:36.059]  Yeah.
[01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:37.940]  We don't get involved in inter-Arab affairs.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.662]  April Gillespie, we don't have a defense treaty with them.
[01:16:40.702 --> 01:16:49.428]  So understand, ladies and gentlemen, grabbing the oil in Afghanistan and then controlling Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the other stands, Turkmenistan, that means China and India don't get it.
[01:16:49.628 --> 01:16:51.592]  See, it's about grabbing it and then shitting on it.
[01:16:51.612 --> 01:16:52.073]  You got it.
[01:16:52.093 --> 01:16:52.373]  You know what?
[01:16:52.513 --> 01:16:53.215]  I can't... You know what?
[01:16:53.856 --> 01:16:59.065]  I'm glad you grabbed it, Alex, because there are a lot of people, you know, kind of in the streets saying, no blood for oil.
[01:16:59.085 --> 01:17:01.409]  And there was this whole image that we're going there to get the oil.
[01:17:01.449 --> 01:17:02.692]  And like you say, the neocons say,
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:03.620]  Hey!
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.062]  We didn't get the oil, so obviously that's not what it was about.
[01:17:06.202 --> 01:17:08.083]  It's about not getting the oil.
[01:17:08.103 --> 01:17:09.104]  It's about capping it.
[01:17:09.684 --> 01:17:10.184]  Not getting it.
[01:17:10.204 --> 01:17:11.005]  In fact, it goes back.
[01:17:11.045 --> 01:17:11.845]  By the way, this is interesting.
[01:17:11.865 --> 01:17:12.386]  You'll find the book.
[01:17:12.926 --> 01:17:15.668]  And by the way, one thing I do in the book, there's like 70 documents shown here.
[01:17:16.108 --> 01:17:18.990]  And, you know, I try to do it, by the way, in a way that's humorous.
[01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.370]  You know, that's how you do news at the BBC.
[01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:21.351]  You can have a little humor.
[01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:25.053]  But you actually have the enhanced OPEC document in there.
[01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:31.197]  But one of the things you'll find out that's interesting is, going back in history, Iraq was invented to control oil.
[01:17:31.832 --> 01:17:34.073]  Winston Churchill invented Iraq in 1920.
[01:17:35.494 --> 01:17:39.856]  And they set up a nation, they got in a guy named Faisal as king.
[01:17:40.896 --> 01:17:49.980]  Winston Churchill took the Kirkuk fields, the Basra fields, and the tar sands of Baghdad, put the three fields together, called it Iraq, invited in a guy named Faisal from Saudi Arabia, he said, you're king.
[01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:51.541]  He said, king of what?
[01:17:52.313 --> 01:17:52.873]  Is it Iraq?
[01:17:52.893 --> 01:17:53.653]  He said, what's Iraq?
[01:17:53.693 --> 01:17:54.974]  He said, it's a place in Baghdad.
[01:17:55.034 --> 01:17:57.434]  And that's why the Saudis have always been our buddies.
[01:17:57.474 --> 01:17:58.815]  It goes back to Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:17:58.835 --> 01:18:03.496]  They just went and picked a tribe, gave them a bunch of machine guns and grenades and said, you're the bosses there.
[01:18:03.736 --> 01:18:04.636]  And we got you.
[01:18:04.676 --> 01:18:13.838]  And so what happened was that Faisal then flipped around and gave a concession to a consortium, including Anglo-Persian, which is now BP.
[01:18:14.811 --> 01:18:29.126]  Uh, Standard Oil, now Exxon, the company that's now Total France and Royal Dutch Shell, those four operators, in 1925, they sat in a hotel room in Brussels, laid out a map of the Mideast, took a red marker, now they didn't have markers, they took a red pen,
[01:18:29.978 --> 01:18:31.199]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:31.219 --> 01:18:33.459]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.405 --> 01:19:10.069]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[01:22:52.737 --> 01:22:59.219]  Greg Palliston, studio.
[01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:00.459]  Greg, this is incredible!
[01:23:00.799 --> 01:23:04.260]  You have the oil company documents, where they're openly talking about stopping the flow.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:12.022]  You expose peak oil as a big PR scam to make us think there's not enough oil to again create the illusion of artificial scarcity.
[01:23:12.082 --> 01:23:14.563]  You've got it all in here, but before we get into that,
[01:23:15.904 --> 01:23:19.145]  In 95 and 96, a bunch of documents were produced by the oil companies.
[01:23:19.205 --> 01:23:21.207]  In 2001, the Associated Press reported on it.
[01:23:21.587 --> 01:23:28.291]  It came back out last year where they said, we've got to buy up these hundreds of independent refineries in North America because there's too much oil.
[01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:31.252]  We can create an artificial bottleneck by buying them up.
[01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:35.975]  Then they blame the environmentalists and say, oh, it's all their fault.
[01:23:36.295 --> 01:23:40.858]  They're the reason that all the refineries have been shut down when we have their own smoking gun documents.
[01:23:41.218 --> 01:23:42.399]  Greg, how do they get away with this?
[01:23:42.739 --> 01:23:43.459]  How'd they get away with it?
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:52.384]  Well, because they, uh... Do you realize that ExxonMobil is the second largest lifetime career giver to George W. Bush and the Bush family, uh, after Enron?
[01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:52.885]  Okay?
[01:23:53.185 --> 01:23:57.888]  I mean, you have to understand that, uh, who's, who's, uh, you know, who's bought the White House for these guys?
[01:23:57.928 --> 01:24:00.309]  And, and, you know, look, also, you know, you can't ignore the fact that
[01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:13.226]  These are the guys who shoplifted the White House, and the same guys helping shoplift the White House are the same guys, the same companies who are collecting the lists on Americans for the war on terror, and that's all about... You collect the lists?
[01:24:13.746 --> 01:24:15.807]  You know, everyone's worried about the civil liberties aspect.
[01:24:16.307 --> 01:24:17.567]  I keep asking a simple question.
[01:24:17.847 --> 01:24:19.067]  What are they doing with these lists?
[01:24:19.407 --> 01:24:22.868]  They sure as heck aren't going after the bad guys, the terrorists.
[01:24:23.728 --> 01:24:27.449]  They're going after, you know... We're the victims on September 11th, not the suspects.
[01:24:27.489 --> 01:24:28.529]  They made us the suspects.
[01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:29.689]  We're under surveillance.
[01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:31.425]  They can't do this legally.
[01:24:31.445 --> 01:24:32.146]  It's against the law.
[01:24:32.226 --> 01:24:34.006]  And by the way, the law is the United States Constitution.
[01:24:34.887 --> 01:24:38.588]  So what they do is they have companies like Choice Point and others collecting the information on us.
[01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:41.409]  Private KGB type operations.
[01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:43.870]  Then they rent the data from them.
[01:24:44.851 --> 01:24:46.151]  To fund it?
[01:24:46.531 --> 01:24:46.771]  Yeah.
[01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:49.092]  And then what happens is once they rent the data, what's it used for?
[01:24:49.172 --> 01:24:50.593]  It's used for elections.
[01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:54.054]  And then they even make, their buddies even make money off the scam.
[01:24:54.294 --> 01:24:54.835]  Oh, billions.
[01:24:54.855 --> 01:24:55.195]  Billions.
[01:24:56.596 --> 01:25:00.840]  And then meanwhile, the Democratic Party's bought off by the same people.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.265]  You can't buy Democrats, you can only rent them.
[01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:15.894]  Even Senator Day O'Connor, even Bob Woodward, all these people, Ron Paul, Congressman, they're all saying we're in danger of a dictatorship.
[01:25:15.934 --> 01:25:18.176]  They say Bush, with the signing statements,
[01:25:18.816 --> 01:25:24.804]  saying he's above the law, John Yoo, Alberto Gonzales saying he is the law, the pure principle.
[01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:31.152]  Can you speak to the fact, I mean, Greg Powell, are we in danger of having some form of a dictatorship?
[01:25:31.352 --> 01:25:34.035]  Well, it's a slow motion, soft dictatorship.
[01:25:34.075 --> 01:25:36.799]  In other words, when these guys start surveilling us,
[01:25:37.239 --> 01:25:38.980]  Okay, and it's against the Constitution.
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:46.244]  And they, by order, say that any law is subject to presidential elimination by signature, any of your rights.
[01:25:46.505 --> 01:25:55.430]  What is a dictatorship except one guy's... A dictatorship, by definition, is one guy saying, I can set the laws, I can ignore these laws, and I can accept those laws.
[01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:59.072]  When one man is above the laws, that is the definition of dictatorship.
[01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:12.730]  Getting into this particular document here in front of me from page 99, Enhanced Government Relationship with OPEC, USA will maintain the contents confidential, should not be reproduced, distributed or used.
[01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:14.771]  What does this document specifically cover?
[01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:21.956]  Okay, what that document is covering, and it's part of the 300 page document, this is part of that document developed by the big oil companies,
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:26.784]  For the Iraq, development of the Iraq oil fields and the Iraq oil industry.
[01:26:26.804 --> 01:26:29.627]  And it's all about, it's not about selling the oil fields.
[01:26:29.868 --> 01:26:33.732]  The other plan I have, the neocons had a plan to say, sell off the oil fields.
[01:26:33.752 --> 01:26:35.573]  And big oil said, that ain't how you do it.
[01:26:35.874 --> 01:26:39.137]  And by the way, you know, the guys I spoke to, you have to understand, are not low level guys.
[01:26:39.818 --> 01:26:42.841]  I spoke to people like Phil Carroll, who's CEO of Shell Oil.
[01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:46.019]  And, you know, again, a lot of these people didn't realize I was wired.
[01:26:46.079 --> 01:26:53.440]  By the way, Carol was at the Bilderberg Group meeting last week, and I was there, and I got picked up and interrogated.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:56.701]  Other people that were there got picked up and asked if they were terrorists and stuff.
[01:26:57.001 --> 01:26:57.501]  So, are you?
[01:26:58.041 --> 01:27:00.682]  No, but I mean... Are you now or have you ever been?
[01:27:00.762 --> 01:27:01.802]  But it's getting scary.
[01:27:01.922 --> 01:27:03.183]  I mean, this stuff's really happening.
[01:27:03.283 --> 01:27:06.323]  Yeah, well, you know, it's fascinating, though, to talk to these oil guys.
[01:27:06.383 --> 01:27:08.364]  I mean, they're deeply concerned that
[01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:11.726]  Saddam was out of control, as they put it.
[01:27:11.766 --> 01:27:13.767]  That he was jerking the oil markets up and down.
[01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:21.813]  And now I have, also in the book, the maps of Iraq and its oil fields that Dick Cheney went over with oil company executives in March of 2001.
[01:27:21.893 --> 01:27:26.256]  You have to understand, that's within six weeks of the inauguration, guys.
[01:27:26.476 --> 01:27:28.078]  This is no September 11th attack or anything.
[01:27:28.098 --> 01:27:30.039]  We already had the maps out of the oil fields of Iraq.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.201]  I'm going to attack Iraq.
[01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:33.422]  I'm going to be a war president.
[01:27:33.902 --> 01:27:36.024]  And I'm paraphrasing the quote, but this is almost it.
[01:27:36.064 --> 01:27:38.566]  He said, a war president cannot be questioned domestically.
[01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:42.109]  So it's about hundreds of billions in no-bid contracts and weapons sales.
[01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:45.972]  It's about restricting the trillions in oil to then make hundreds of billions a year off that.
[01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:47.265]  It's incredible.
[01:27:47.545 --> 01:27:54.730]  Well, you know, and some of the stuff like the review, as I find out, the oil fields of Iraq are being reviewed by, who's in the room?
[01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:59.273]  It was not only oil company executives, Council of Foreign Relations and Ken Lay of all people.
[01:27:59.594 --> 01:28:03.517]  And that's because they're going over what people thought was that they were rewriting the energy laws of the U.S.
[01:28:03.537 --> 01:28:04.758]  That was a very minor part of it.
[01:28:04.818 --> 01:28:07.920]  I now know it was the total energy plan for the planet.
[01:28:08.752 --> 01:28:13.054]  And they talked about what they called, quote, and this is a quote, military option for Iraq.
[01:28:13.114 --> 01:28:13.754]  This is March 2001.
[01:28:13.974 --> 01:28:15.815]  This is before 9-11.
[01:28:16.015 --> 01:28:16.775]  Way before.
[01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:19.636]  When we get back, we've got a long segment, plenty of time to talk.
[01:28:19.696 --> 01:28:33.821]  I want to get into what this global plan is, because you've got the 300 page document, and that can give us a window into what's going to happen in the future, what the neocons want, what the oil companies want, how these two different bodies, you know, how their program
[01:28:34.699 --> 01:28:40.164]  Converges, where it differs, and how Europe ties into all this, what you see happening in the future.
[01:28:40.424 --> 01:28:41.605]  Greg Palastin, studio.
[01:28:43.646 --> 01:28:44.547]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.048 --> 01:28:46.649]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:50.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:58.145]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[01:28:58.305 --> 01:29:04.010]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:09.274]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[01:29:09.514 --> 01:29:14.018]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[01:29:14.298 --> 01:29:20.604]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[01:29:20.885 --> 01:29:22.426]  Xango is revolutionary.
[01:29:22.626 --> 01:29:32.656]  Not only has Xango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Xango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[01:29:32.957 --> 01:29:35.099]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[01:29:35.419 --> 01:29:37.040]  Unleash the power of Dango today!

[01:29:41.422 --> 01:29:42.742]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[01:29:53.544 --> 01:29:58.770]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:07.000]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:14.308]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.488 --> 01:30:15.748]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:30:15.848 --> 01:30:21.729]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.929 --> 01:30:27.010]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:36.012]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[01:31:49.044 --> 01:31:51.424]  Create the Dream is a division of the Creative Concepts
[01:31:53.922 --> 01:31:59.565]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:01.446 --> 01:32:05.849]  We've got Rick Palast in studio with us, the new book, Armed Madhouse.
[01:32:06.767 --> 01:32:18.991]  And he's the author of the New York Times bestseller, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, Armed Madhouse, Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf, China Floats, Bush Sinks, The Scheme is Still 08, No Child Behind Left.
[01:32:20.292 --> 01:32:23.993]  I want to get into their big plan in the future, what you know from talking to these executives.
[01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:25.548]  I think so.
[01:32:46.653 --> 01:32:47.894]  We're running out of crude, dude.
[01:32:48.174 --> 01:32:55.118]  I mean, one of the problems is, Alex, and I lost a lot of my supporters, and I'm sorry about this, but I'm an investigative reporter, so I investigated peak oil.
[01:32:55.138 --> 01:32:57.860]  What I found out is that it was created by shell oil.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.541]  And I call it the shell game in there.
[01:33:00.406 --> 01:33:02.927]  By a guy named Hubbard, who is the chief geologist for Shell.
[01:33:03.387 --> 01:33:13.051]  And Shell was trying, was panicked because they were finding all this new oil in the Mideast, and so what are they going to do?
[01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:21.274]  So they announced, instead of that, God we've got a lot of new oil, they said, well let's tell you we've got a lot of new oil, but you know, it's going to run out, it's going to peak, it's going to suddenly collapse on us.
[01:33:21.714 --> 01:33:26.936]  And now the latest thing that I found, by the way Alex, and I show it in the book, inside the Department of Energy,
[01:33:27.496 --> 01:33:44.695]  Inside the Department of Energy is a document showing that while, yes, we're going to start running to the end of Saudi Arabia's oil, it's not going to be so quick by the way, that if you add in what they call the Orinoco Extra Heavy Oil, that that reserve
[01:33:45.809 --> 01:33:48.210]  And 90% of it's in Venezuela.
[01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:51.891]  That reserve is five times bigger than the Saudi Arabian reserve.
[01:33:52.071 --> 01:33:53.871]  So we are swimming in this stuff.
[01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:56.612]  And this is their own internal documents that they don't want the public to know about.
[01:33:56.692 --> 01:33:58.813]  And by the way, they called BBC Television London.
[01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:01.593]  When I put it on TV, they said, where'd you get that document?
[01:34:02.273 --> 01:34:03.434]  And I said, we don't remember.
[01:34:04.454 --> 01:34:06.295]  But see, I can't do that in US TV.
[01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:07.775]  I can't take an inside document.
[01:34:08.345 --> 01:34:10.109]  That I find about all this oil.
[01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:11.572]  And the Department of Energy knows it.
[01:34:11.893 --> 01:34:12.916]  Why shouldn't we know it?
[01:34:13.136 --> 01:34:13.777]  Why is it a secret?
[01:34:13.798 --> 01:34:15.040]  It's not a secret to the oil companies.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.123]  It's not a secret to our government.
[01:34:20.129 --> 01:34:41.503]  I know, it just makes me become speechless to have the documents in front of me, to see the same documents, to track back peak oil when it's first started getting promoted 6, 7, 8 years ago, to see that it was being financed through these Shell grants to Russian scientists, to see that it emanated from one of their chief petroleum geologists.
[01:34:41.824 --> 01:34:43.785]  I have family who are petroleum geologists.
[01:34:44.466 --> 01:34:54.456]  My family has worked in the oil fields, you know, from the level of Roughnecks to the level of chief engineers running huge refineries in Houston.
[01:34:54.996 --> 01:34:59.661]  And we, about five, six years ago, I first started learning about Peak Oil, and I knew it was a fraud then.
[01:35:00.021 --> 01:35:03.765]  I started talking to family, and they said it is the biggest joke on the world.
[01:35:04.085 --> 01:35:09.970]  We have so much oil, they're finding it in the North Sea, they're finding it in Russia, they're finding it in India, it's in China.
[01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:12.392]  Oil is all in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:35:12.912 --> 01:35:16.555]  Mexico itself has three times the oil of the lower 48 in the U.S.
[01:35:19.897 --> 01:35:23.700]  Nothing comes close to Venezuela, and that's one of the reasons why they want to kill Hugo Chavez.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:25.762]  I was just down meeting with the President of Venezuela.
[01:35:25.822 --> 01:35:26.503]  Oh, tell us about that.
[01:35:26.643 --> 01:35:27.363]  Yeah, last month.
[01:35:27.603 --> 01:35:31.927]  So I showed him the, you know, the Department of Energy material saying he had more oil than Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:31.947 --> 01:35:34.048]  He said, well, hey, Greg, I know that.
[01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:46.478]  What he was saying, though, what he was concerned about is that, you know, obviously you had the Reverend Pat Robertson say, you know, Hugo Chavez, he's the President of Venezuela, thinks you're trying to assassinate him.
[01:35:46.698 --> 01:35:48.400]  Well, I think we should just go ahead and do it.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.421]  They're afraid.
[01:35:49.561 --> 01:35:50.081]  Oh, I love that.
[01:35:50.121 --> 01:35:53.264]  He's paranoid saying they want to kill him, but they're on the news saying kill him.
[01:35:53.544 --> 01:36:00.851]  Four days after you came on my show in 2002, on my show, it's in my book, Is It Deterrenting?, the transcript, that transcript got put in a bunch of foreign newspapers.
[01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:03.053]  It went supernova, as we say.
[01:36:03.293 --> 01:36:05.435]  You said there's going to be a coup in the next few months.
[01:36:05.696 --> 01:36:07.277]  Four days later, they kidnap him.
[01:36:07.317 --> 01:36:10.620]  But I want to go back over that, but I interrupted.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:11.941]  Tell us, you met with the President.
[01:36:11.981 --> 01:36:12.242]  Tell us.
[01:36:12.322 --> 01:36:13.603]  Okay, so I met with the President.
[01:36:14.303 --> 01:36:22.008]  And by the way, that was very helpful, your show, because one of the things that he credits with saving his life, because they kidnapped him and obviously the next move was to kill him.
[01:36:22.388 --> 01:36:26.871]  But by getting out the word that he was in fact kidnapped, that it was an illegal coup d'etat, the U.S.
[01:36:26.891 --> 01:36:33.635]  State Department said he had resigned, was in despair, and of course they were going to say he committed suicide or something like that, because it was a lie.
[01:36:34.494 --> 01:36:35.414]  And it was exposed.
[01:36:35.494 --> 01:36:36.375]  It saved his life.
[01:36:36.895 --> 01:36:39.856]  And so that's very, you know, getting the word out can be very important.
[01:36:39.876 --> 01:36:41.976]  But the important thing is that he's sitting on all this oil.
[01:36:42.236 --> 01:36:44.497]  He said, look, I'd like to cut a deal with the American people.
[01:36:44.537 --> 01:36:46.017]  I said, I'm not going to cut the deal with Bush.
[01:36:46.657 --> 01:36:47.918]  I'll cut the deal with the American people.
[01:36:47.938 --> 01:36:50.519]  Let's cut the price of oil by a good third right now.
[01:36:50.619 --> 01:36:52.079]  Knock a buck a gallon off your gas.
[01:36:52.639 --> 01:36:59.161]  I'll give cheap heating oil to all the cities in America, all low-income areas, to every fuel co-op in America permanently.
[01:36:59.699 --> 01:37:03.741]  But, one, we've got to end the kind of Cold War that they're starting against Latin America.
[01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:05.081]  That's got to stop.
[01:37:05.381 --> 01:37:09.843]  The other is that, he says, you've got to get rid of Saudi, in effect, get rid of Saudi control of OPEC.
[01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:16.946]  Because, you know, OPEC has this game where they shoot the price of oil way, way up through the ceiling.
[01:37:17.287 --> 01:37:21.348]  About every six, eight years, they dump it down to nothing to wipe out alternatives.
[01:37:21.388 --> 01:37:25.170]  He says, I can't operate, you know, our nation's getting killed this way with the up and down.
[01:37:25.954 --> 01:37:27.095]  Stabilize the price of oil.
[01:37:27.355 --> 01:37:28.696]  We got plenty of oil for you.
[01:37:28.936 --> 01:37:29.637]  Let's work it out.
[01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:38.603]  And Bush's response, this government's response, big oil, and by the Democratic Party too, both parties are in on this, is kill him.
[01:37:39.844 --> 01:37:40.764]  We're not going to tolerate that.
[01:37:40.825 --> 01:37:47.169]  And one of the big reasons, by the way, is that he said, look, Abdullah gives you all his money back.
[01:37:47.309 --> 01:37:53.814]  Basically, almost all the petrodollars, all the big money we spend on our oil goes out to the Mideast, through the oil companies, out to the Mideast and back into the U.S.
[01:37:53.854 --> 01:37:54.214]  Treasury.
[01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:57.993]  So that we've run up a two trillion dollar debt, Alex.
[01:37:58.813 --> 01:38:00.214]  Extra since Bush has come in.
[01:38:00.294 --> 01:38:01.315]  Two trillion dollars.
[01:38:01.716 --> 01:38:02.997]  That's all been borrowed abroad.
[01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:03.937]  Every single penny.
[01:38:04.218 --> 01:38:05.238]  Petro dollars are the key.
[01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:10.423]  Chavez said, I'll give you cheap petroleum, but I'm not going to lend George Bush back money for oil wars.
[01:38:11.323 --> 01:38:12.484]  I'm not doing that.
[01:38:12.504 --> 01:38:14.526]  In fact, he took twenty billion dollars out of the U.S.
[01:38:14.546 --> 01:38:15.487]  Federal Reserve.
[01:38:15.607 --> 01:38:19.570]  Now tell me if I'm wrong, but I've been following this and following your reportage and others.
[01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:26.132]  He said, I'll give it to you at about 10%, 90% off.
[01:38:26.732 --> 01:38:34.134]  Then even some of the oil companies and the people that would distribute it on the East Coast, they said, no, how about 60% off?
[01:38:34.515 --> 01:38:35.815]  So that's what they ended up doing.
[01:38:37.354 --> 01:38:40.276]  Now, Chavez has reversed and said, fine.
[01:38:40.736 --> 01:38:46.881]  If the oil companies say, if I cut oil prices, you're just going to restrict your production, fine.
[01:38:47.122 --> 01:38:58.191]  You want me to do the deal, then I'm going to start taxing the oil companies a modest amount when you explore and develop here for my people, and it's a very small percentage.
[01:38:58.451 --> 01:38:59.692]  Now they're going even crazier.
[01:39:00.032 --> 01:39:03.515]  Yes, well, one of the things is he doubled the royalties on the oil company.
[01:39:04.187 --> 01:39:06.288]  So obviously they weren't too happy about that.
[01:39:07.788 --> 01:39:11.430]  But on the other hand, they still keep 70% of the stuff that's worth $70 a barrel.
[01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:13.290]  I was about to say, before they were paying 16%.
[01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:16.391]  In fact, they had some contracts with 1% royalty.
[01:39:17.432 --> 01:39:17.812]  1% royalty!
[01:39:17.852 --> 01:39:19.912]  I mean, this is starvation for these people.
[01:39:20.233 --> 01:39:23.814]  So he's building nations, also lending it to nations like Ecuador, etc.
[01:39:23.874 --> 01:39:25.854]  Because what he says is, we have to eliminate.
[01:39:26.015 --> 01:39:30.196]  One of the reasons why they're out to get him, he says, we have to eliminate the IMF.
[01:39:30.854 --> 01:39:33.195]  We have to replace it with the International Humanities Fund.
[01:39:33.235 --> 01:39:39.338]  He said the International Monetary Fund is basically a financial dictatorship.
[01:39:40.319 --> 01:39:41.359]  And it is killing.
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:42.920]  And you got your own documents on that?
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:48.883]  Yes, in fact, in the book I have the documents that were just an absolute wipeout for the nation of Ecuador.
[01:39:50.204 --> 01:39:54.146]  Ecuador, basically this was to help out these bond speculators.
[01:39:54.226 --> 01:39:55.747]  Everyone knew these guys were a bunch of criminals.
[01:39:56.713 --> 01:40:01.796]  But the IMF was backing up these bond speculators who were demanding a bonus payoff from Ecuador.
[01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:03.737]  And the President of Ecuador met with me.
[01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:07.320]  He said, if we pay this level of debt, I mean, our nation is destroyed.
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.741]  If we're dead, who's going to pay them off?
[01:40:09.021 --> 01:40:09.741]  It's going to destroy our nation.
[01:40:09.761 --> 01:40:13.303]  But you have the IMF World Bank documents, Joseph Stiglitz, our Chief Economist, went public.
[01:40:13.664 --> 01:40:15.745]  In there, they say it's about destroying countries.
[01:40:16.005 --> 01:40:17.526]  They say it's about creating poverty.
[01:40:17.546 --> 01:40:19.527]  Because again, these elites are monopoly men.
[01:40:19.907 --> 01:40:22.009]  It isn't about a free market, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:22.329 --> 01:40:24.550]  They're not free market, just like... What's a free market?
[01:40:26.011 --> 01:40:28.713]  Just like General Spendley Butler said, war is a racket.
[01:40:29.033 --> 01:40:34.777]  He said, I was a highly paid mercenary who was sent into these countries for big moneyed interest.
[01:40:34.997 --> 01:40:38.260]  So understand, they're threatened by you having a good economy.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.301]  They're threatened by you being solvent.
[01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:42.242]  Look at it here in the U.S.
[01:40:42.343 --> 01:40:45.044]  Everything is designed to get us into debt.
[01:40:45.084 --> 01:40:46.505]  This is a predatory economy.
[01:40:46.545 --> 01:40:47.246]  Can you speak to that?
[01:40:47.486 --> 01:40:48.127]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:40:48.147 --> 01:40:49.287]  There is a section in there.
[01:40:49.508 --> 01:40:55.192]  You have to understand, King Abdullah has lent us a trillion bucks out of Saudi Arabia, lending back our own money.
[01:40:55.212 --> 01:40:56.233]  We get charged big time.
[01:40:56.253 --> 01:41:02.258]  Think of it as an oil tax at the pump, which goes out through Exxon, out to Saudi Arabia and back.
[01:41:02.718 --> 01:41:08.903]  Now, as you know, the Koran prohibits the charging of interest, but King Abdullah doesn't mind grabbing a big pound of flesh from us.
[01:41:09.683 --> 01:41:15.688]  And also the Chinese are big, big lenders, about almost two-thirds of a trillion dollars at this point.
[01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:23.325]  And the result is these extra high interest rates in the U.S., which has been killing off the auto industry, killing off the airline industry.
[01:41:23.345 --> 01:41:30.227]  And you have to understand, these are unionized, high-wage industries, which are now becoming low-wage industries.
[01:41:30.868 --> 01:41:33.548]  And frankly, that's mission accomplished.
[01:41:33.568 --> 01:41:34.709]  These guys aren't shedding a tear.
[01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:35.469]  Why don't they stop it?
[01:41:36.164 --> 01:41:37.065]  They're not shedding a tear.
[01:41:37.085 --> 01:41:38.185]  Why not cut the deal with Chavez?
[01:41:38.566 --> 01:41:39.726]  Cheap oil, lots of it.
[01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.747]  Tell the Saudis to go fly.
[01:41:42.048 --> 01:41:47.871]  But instead we got our president chauffeuring around King Abdullah and his golf cart at the Crawford Ranch.
[01:41:47.991 --> 01:41:50.032]  Now, the Globalists are long-term players.
[01:41:50.092 --> 01:41:55.136]  These deals that we still live under were made in the Middle East over 80 years ago.
[01:41:55.156 --> 01:41:56.096]  That's right.
[01:41:56.236 --> 01:42:02.320]  When Mohamed Mozadek, man of the year time magazine, humanitarian, poet, pro-America, kicked the Communists out of his country.
[01:42:03.132 --> 01:42:10.115]  Comrade Roosevelt, before he died, went on NPR and admitted that our government carried out terror attacks in Iran to then blame it on Mosaddegh.
[01:42:10.395 --> 01:42:13.076]  They put him on house arrest, cut his minister's heads off.
[01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:15.097]  Can you speak to specifically what happened in Iran?
[01:42:15.117 --> 01:42:15.817]  Man, that's a grim situation.
[01:42:15.837 --> 01:42:17.637]  In the 1950s, Mosaddegh, the elected president of Iran,
[01:42:24.967 --> 01:42:26.510]  Nationalize the oil companies.
[01:42:27.351 --> 01:42:32.719]  Then the US and Britain went on a successful campaign to overthrow his elected government.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.948]  And if you read the CIA documents, which have now been declassified, National Security Archive, you really got to go to these Alex.
[01:42:39.057 --> 01:42:44.860]  The horrible thing is that the Shah of Iran, who took over, actually didn't want to overthrow the elected government.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.560]  He was scared.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:50.422]  So the CIA said, what we have to do is activate the Islamic mullahs who have been out of politics.
[01:42:50.882 --> 01:42:54.664]  Activate them and convince them that democracy is un-Islamic.
[01:42:55.521 --> 01:43:00.543]  So that's right in those documents at the National Security Archive.
[01:43:00.663 --> 01:43:06.326]  So what they're doing is, we created, the CIA created this fanatic Muslim anti-democratic bent.
[01:43:06.586 --> 01:43:10.648]  It was a creation to get rid of the elected government which had taken over the oil companies.
[01:43:12.509 --> 01:43:14.690]  You're getting close on that one.
[01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:16.730]  Mad Mock Mood is part of the game.
[01:43:16.770 --> 01:43:17.691]  It's a Punch and Judy show.
[01:43:17.731 --> 01:43:17.851]  Watch!
[01:43:39.558 --> 01:43:46.423]  Alex, every time the price of oil gets towards $60 a barrel, suddenly Mad Makhmoud out there in Tehran says, we're going to blow up Israel!
[01:43:46.643 --> 01:43:49.324]  Or next time it drops, he goes, we've got bugs and bombs!
[01:43:49.705 --> 01:43:51.986]  And then if it drops again, Bush says, oh, we're going to go get them!
[01:43:52.086 --> 01:43:58.390]  And each time either Bush or Mad Makhmoud says something, the price of oil is up another $5 to $8 a barrel.
[01:43:58.791 --> 01:44:00.552]  You have to look at the timing of those statements.
[01:44:00.932 --> 01:44:02.173]  It's a Punch and Judy show.
[01:44:02.533 --> 01:44:05.615]  The guy that they're worried about is Chavez of Venezuela.
[01:44:05.635 --> 01:44:08.597]  Well, let's talk about that for a second, and then let's go back to it, right?
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.583]  I mean, we know that our government allowed them to fly in Ayatollah Khamenei.
[01:44:13.883 --> 01:44:15.445]  We know Reagan then and Bush Sr.
[01:44:15.505 --> 01:44:17.747]  made backroom deals with him to get Jimmy Carter out.
[01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:20.008]  We know that they used him to attack the Serbs.
[01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:22.471]  And then Iran-Contra, I mean, my God!
[01:44:22.651 --> 01:44:26.054]  I mean, we literally gave guns to the Ayatollah.
[01:44:26.074 --> 01:44:29.477]  Do you think they're on secure sat phones, having briefings?
[01:44:29.517 --> 01:44:31.038]  I mean, how staged is it?
[01:44:31.998 --> 01:44:33.521]  I think it's extraordinarily staged.
[01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:37.025]  But I think also, I mean, you know, the other problem is that these things get out of control.
[01:44:37.506 --> 01:44:38.668]  And we have to be very careful about it.
[01:44:38.688 --> 01:44:39.829]  This is really playing with fire.
[01:44:39.869 --> 01:44:41.331]  Just like when... Well, that's what the globalists do.
[01:44:41.351 --> 01:44:42.293]  That's what the Bushies do.
[01:44:42.653 --> 01:44:43.635]  They set people up.
[01:44:43.955 --> 01:44:48.702]  I know, but you know, the problem is that we created this fanatic Islamic
[01:44:49.326 --> 01:44:52.687]  politicized force, dangerous force, which wasn't there before.
[01:44:52.727 --> 01:44:54.268]  They had an elected government of Iran.
[01:44:54.548 --> 01:44:58.689]  We overthrew him because he grabbed the oil fields and we empowered these maniac mullahs.
[01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:11.033]  Well, I mean, I actually looked the documents up and I have Kerr-Roosevelt's after-action reports to Ted Downing Street like they're his boss and to President Eisenhower and he wasn't asking for that much of the BP oil.
[01:45:11.174 --> 01:45:12.694]  He was just saying, can we keep some of it?
[01:45:12.974 --> 01:45:13.334]  That's right.
[01:45:13.354 --> 01:45:13.934]  Same with Chavez.
[01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.275]  He's saying, look, let us keep
[01:45:15.982 --> 01:45:18.462]  We want 30 percent, not 16 percent.
[01:45:18.542 --> 01:45:20.383]  And these 1 percent deals have got to go.
[01:45:21.003 --> 01:45:24.024]  And he said, that's the deal.
[01:45:24.064 --> 01:45:25.224]  You can't squeeze our nation.
[01:45:25.264 --> 01:45:26.664]  We can't be an oil colony forever.
[01:45:27.144 --> 01:45:30.905]  There are a million people living in cardboard shacks around Caracas.
[01:45:31.305 --> 01:45:35.106]  And so he charged you oil companies, and now you don't see those cardboard shacks anymore.
[01:45:35.126 --> 01:45:36.206]  Same thing in Mexico City.
[01:45:36.226 --> 01:45:38.726]  30-something million people, half of them living in cardboard boxes, folks.
[01:45:38.786 --> 01:45:39.246]  I've seen it.
[01:45:40.207 --> 01:45:41.447]  It's unbelievable.
[01:45:41.567 --> 01:45:42.647]  They've got all this oil wealth.
[01:45:43.067 --> 01:45:47.392]  And, you know, they gotta keep some... The problem is that for the average American, what are we getting out of it?
[01:45:47.412 --> 01:45:48.673]  We're getting... They squeeze the oil.
[01:45:48.693 --> 01:45:50.275]  We're paying high price of the pump.
[01:45:50.735 --> 01:45:51.536]  High interest rates.
[01:45:52.277 --> 01:45:56.421]  Our manufacturing industries are going down the tube with this stuff.
[01:45:56.972 --> 01:45:58.714]  I mean, it is not for our benefit.
[01:45:58.814 --> 01:46:00.756]  So the economy is being looted.
[01:46:00.776 --> 01:46:04.419]  I want to specifically then talk about in the future.
[01:46:04.459 --> 01:46:05.700]  You made really good predictions there.
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:08.383]  You said Chavez in the next month to two months.
[01:46:08.403 --> 01:46:09.444]  In fact, I've got the quote in my book.
[01:46:09.464 --> 01:46:10.185]  I can dig it out.
[01:46:10.725 --> 01:46:16.030]  Just type Greg Pallast, Alex Jones, World Bank IMF documents into Google.
[01:46:16.090 --> 01:46:16.611]  It'll come up.
[01:46:18.513 --> 01:46:19.033]  Well, a couple things.
[01:46:19.053 --> 01:46:20.454]  I don't know if I'm good at prognosticating.
[01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:23.918]  The information about the coup is because I had inside information about the coup.
[01:46:23.938 --> 01:46:24.519]  So I'm more investigative.
[01:46:38.670 --> 01:46:46.954]  And what we're finding now is that the neocons are in twilight right now because they, look, when they're trying to grab the assets of Iran, that was one thing.
[01:46:47.314 --> 01:46:52.937]  When they try to grab the oil fields without the permission of the oil companies and have their own scheme, they got slapped around big, big, big time.
[01:46:52.957 --> 01:46:57.600]  So you agree with some of the other inside experts we've got that there is a split?
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.841]  Yeah, there's a split between big oil and the neocons.
[01:47:00.041 --> 01:47:02.022]  The big oil has a big long-term picture.
[01:47:02.917 --> 01:47:06.859]  And they're not big oil ain't talking about democracy in the Mideast.
[01:47:06.879 --> 01:47:13.923]  They're talking about controlling those oil fields and as they use their phrase, enhancing OPEC, making sure that no one busts the quotas.
[01:47:14.103 --> 01:47:19.386]  Unfortunately, I would say the obvious thing for these guys to do is to assassinate the President of Venezuela.
[01:47:20.807 --> 01:47:22.948]  Unfortunately, that's an obvious thing for them to do.
[01:47:23.969 --> 01:47:27.331]  We are now in a virtual Cold War with all of Latin America.
[01:47:29.678 --> 01:47:32.099]  This is a very dangerous business right now.
[01:47:32.539 --> 01:47:33.879]  Everyone's looking to the Mideast.
[01:47:34.479 --> 01:47:35.240]  Get ready, guys.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:41.561]  The big Cold War, and we're not going to move in with the 82nd Airborne because those people will shoot back.
[01:47:41.621 --> 01:47:45.142]  It's not going to be like fun and games, like Desert Storm.
[01:47:46.222 --> 01:47:50.723]  So that's not going to happen, but it's all going to be through puppet coup d'etat action.
[01:47:52.323 --> 01:47:56.444]  We cannot let a guy with bigger reserves than Saudi Arabia
[01:47:57.128 --> 01:48:00.032]  Start cutting deals that don't involve oil companies.
[01:48:00.072 --> 01:48:05.238]  I mean, he's threatening Saudi hegemony of OPEC.
[01:48:05.418 --> 01:48:10.324]  And now he's got his own type of coalition or alliance down there.
[01:48:10.364 --> 01:48:11.325]  These countries are getting together.
[01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:12.827]  So what's the time frame?
[01:48:13.855 --> 01:48:17.796]  I don't know, because obviously the Big Oil guys, they didn't get enough information from them.
[01:48:17.816 --> 01:48:19.576]  I mean, I could only have so much access.
[01:48:19.616 --> 01:48:21.577]  But we know they're increasing troop levels right now.
[01:48:21.597 --> 01:48:28.919]  Yeah, I mean, I'm hoping that... One thing Big Oil does not like is too much turmoil, unless they've set it off.
[01:48:29.179 --> 01:48:34.340]  But again, playing with fire, once you start playing games with the Iranians,
[01:48:35.043 --> 01:48:35.984]  It can't get out of control.
[01:48:36.044 --> 01:48:38.506]  I don't see how they can control these fires that they set.
[01:48:38.566 --> 01:48:44.110]  But hasn't Big Oil set bushes in them up, kind of their wind-up toys, to take the fall later?
[01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:45.011]  I mean, they do that a lot.
[01:48:45.031 --> 01:48:46.833]  It is James Baker and Daddy and all them.
[01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:47.313]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:47.353 --> 01:48:52.137]  Well, I think that little George is going to... They're going to load all the negatives on him.
[01:48:52.717 --> 01:48:53.878]  The war, everything else.
[01:48:53.938 --> 01:48:55.159]  The war's going the way they want it.
[01:48:55.239 --> 01:48:57.541]  Oil's at 70 bucks a barrel, but someone's got to take a fall.
[01:48:57.561 --> 01:48:59.383]  Well, they call it the strategy of balkanization.
[01:48:59.403 --> 01:49:01.905]  I have an Israeli document, 1983 Pentagon documents.
[01:49:02.285 --> 01:49:06.966]  Well, in fact, when I talked to General Jay Garner, as you'll see in the book, General Jay was our first viceroy that we put in charge, Alex.
[01:49:06.986 --> 01:49:09.067]  And in our man house, I actually met with him.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:29.221]  And, uh, you know, he was saying we could have had peace between these factions, but obviously they didn't want it.
[01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:29.942]  No, they didn't.
[01:49:30.182 --> 01:49:31.042]  Greg Powell, stay there.
[01:49:31.082 --> 01:49:32.683]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:49:33.183 --> 01:49:34.203]  We will continue.
[01:49:34.223 --> 01:49:35.423]  There's so much in this book.
[01:49:35.864 --> 01:49:46.807]  I haven't read it yet, but just scanning over it, I think this... I think this blows, just from looking at it, the spectrum of data in it, I think this blows best democracy money can buy away.
[01:49:47.167 --> 01:49:47.387]  It does.
[01:49:47.427 --> 01:49:48.367]  It does?
[01:49:48.528 --> 01:49:49.228]  That's from the author.
[01:49:49.268 --> 01:49:49.768]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.972 --> 01:49:57.814]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.075 --> 01:49:59.656]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.996 --> 01:50:04.680]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:11.766]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.086 --> 01:50:14.048]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.268 --> 01:50:17.110]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.211 --> 01:50:21.855]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.075 --> 01:50:26.499]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:33.945]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:50:58.049 --> 01:50:58.549]  are located?
[01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:02.133]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:51:55.399 --> 01:51:55.740]  I think so.
[01:52:10.643 --> 01:52:11.304]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.163 --> 01:52:43.244]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.424 --> 01:52:49.385]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.827 --> 01:52:59.667]  Greg Pallast is going to stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:52:59.687 --> 01:53:03.768]  We'll even have time to take a few phone calls specifically on the book, Our Madhouse.

[01:53:05.798 --> 01:53:11.280]  I also want to talk about Ann Coulter, not to give her attention, but just to analyze.
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:12.641]  She's a low-grade moron.
[01:53:12.701 --> 01:53:17.043]  I mean, and that's why she's effective for the low-grade morons that really think they're conservative, but they aren't.
[01:53:17.063 --> 01:53:24.686]  We're going to talk about some of the nightmare stuff she's been doing just to hype her very communistic books that she pushes as conservatism.
[01:53:24.746 --> 01:53:30.069]  Now, before we go back to Greg Palast, my new film, Martial Law, has been out for a while.
[01:53:30.089 --> 01:53:31.029]  Greg Palast is in it.
[01:53:31.853 --> 01:53:36.735]  And it is an incredible police state film of people in that little mini FEMA camp run by Bechtel out there.
[01:53:38.095 --> 01:53:44.278]  We have the evidence of 9-11 and that entire operation and how they're using it for a police state.
[01:53:44.298 --> 01:53:45.338]  It is such an important film.
[01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:46.439]  Three hours long.

[01:54:12.049 --> 01:54:15.971]  The truth has gotten out and this entire agenda is now in massive trouble.

[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.543]  Folks, you need to get armed at Madhouse by Greg Palast.
[01:54:40.923 --> 01:54:42.264]  Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?
[01:54:42.344 --> 01:54:46.828]  China Floats, Bush Sinks, The Scheme to Steal 08, No Child Behind, Left.
[01:54:47.268 --> 01:54:49.370]  That sounds like a Dr. Strangelove title.
[01:54:49.410 --> 01:54:53.333]  Dr. Strangelove or How I've Learned to Love the Bomb.
[01:54:55.308 --> 01:54:58.290]  Looking at this, there are so many things that you've done in this book that really impressed me.
[01:54:58.330 --> 01:54:59.930]  I've been scanning over it during the breaks.
[01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:01.371]  You tackled peak oil.
[01:55:01.391 --> 01:55:08.535]  I want to spend a few minutes getting into that, because don't liberals out there, or progressives, or conservatives, don't we all just want the truth?
[01:55:08.575 --> 01:55:10.275]  Don't we want to know the truth?
[01:55:10.335 --> 01:55:14.357]  Not some lie that we've accepted as the truth becomes some religious orthodoxy.
[01:55:14.638 --> 01:55:19.480]  Peak oil is a scam, is a fraud, is a hoax, and I'm sick of it.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.401]  Can you specifically, as we end this hour,
[01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:28.966]  Speak to the evidence, the chapter in the book on this, and how now some of your grassroots people are now mad at you.
[01:55:29.006 --> 01:55:31.487]  Hey folks, Gregg doesn't lie to you, he does the research!
[01:55:31.727 --> 01:55:32.728]  I'm kind of stuck, you know.
[01:55:32.748 --> 01:55:44.516]  I mean, I went into the peak oil situation just to see what that was about, and what I found is that, you know, it was basically put together by Shell Oil to convince us, number one, that oil is scarce, so it's got to be much more expensive.
[01:55:44.596 --> 01:55:50.860]  Because remember, when they came out with peak oil, it was already down to a nickel a gallon and dropping.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:55.322]  Shell was in a panic, so they announced, well, it looks like we've got a lot, but we're about to run out of it.
[01:55:55.942 --> 01:55:59.723]  The second is to convince you that we need to secure the supply.
[01:55:59.743 --> 01:56:01.584]  You mean raw crude?
[01:56:01.844 --> 01:56:02.004]  Right.
[01:56:02.385 --> 01:56:03.405]  Raw crude was a nickel a gallon.
[01:56:03.425 --> 01:56:03.945]  Sorry, start over.
[01:56:03.965 --> 01:56:06.366]  Yeah, but the gasoline is not, but this is 1956.
[01:56:06.406 --> 01:56:07.046]  Exactly.
[01:56:07.407 --> 01:56:18.131]  And that we have to protect our, and that because it's scarce, we have to protect our supplies, which means the takeover of Iran, the overthrow of Mossadegh, the control of Iraq, the whole thing.
[01:56:18.151 --> 01:56:23.953]  Even a lot of conservatives, either they say, oh we don't want the oil, see it's not being pumped, well that's artificial scarcity.
[01:56:23.973 --> 01:56:30.536]  Then the other camp of neocon, the conservatives, because they're not real conservatives, they say, oh yeah, we need that oil, peak oil.
[01:56:30.596 --> 01:56:31.996]  Conservatives have bought into it.
[01:56:32.256 --> 01:56:38.579]  Well, the other thing that's happening is that, look, I understand why environmentalists kind of like the idea of peak oil, because they say, look, we're running out, so we better move to something else.
[01:56:38.779 --> 01:56:40.799]  We better move to something else for two other reasons.
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.600]  Number one, it's filthy.
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.180]  Okay?
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.382]  Number two, is that we don't want to be oil slaves.
[01:56:48.078 --> 01:56:49.180]  We don't need to be oil slaves.
[01:57:00.948 --> 01:57:03.049]  But that doesn't mean that we're running out of oil, guys.
[01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:04.409]  We have to tell the truth about this.
[01:57:04.469 --> 01:57:05.669]  We are floating in this stuff.
[01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:08.230]  Plus, it's designed to keep us in the oil monopoly.
[01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:08.650]  Yeah.
[01:57:09.190 --> 01:57:22.694]  And then transfer all of our wealth, using it as the only world currency, using oil as a world currency, forcing us to use that world currency, and then jacking up the prices so more and more of our economy goes into funding these guys, which then they put back into the till to get even more control.
[01:57:23.594 --> 01:57:27.135]  No one's explained to me why oil companies would hide the fact
[01:57:27.893 --> 01:57:29.254]  That, uh, we're running out of oil.
[01:57:29.554 --> 01:57:30.674]  Less oil, the higher the price.
[01:57:30.694 --> 01:57:31.854]  The less oil, the higher the price!
[01:57:31.894 --> 01:57:32.575]  We'll be right back.

[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.501]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.201 --> 01:57:52.241]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.962 --> 01:57:54.042]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.722 --> 01:57:55.522]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.283 --> 01:57:57.063]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.868 --> 01:58:01.510]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:06.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.013 --> 01:58:11.194]  Greg Powell is in studio for two more segments.
[01:58:11.214 --> 01:58:15.716]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to go to your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:58:16.496 --> 01:58:18.397]  Mike, Sarah, Joe, Mike, and others.
[01:58:19.518 --> 01:58:20.398]  Greg, I'm impressed.
[01:58:20.999 --> 01:58:27.565]  I mean, just flipping through your new book, Arm Madhouse, it is really impressive, and I can tell you right now, I do want to carry this.
[01:58:27.986 --> 01:58:31.449]  I mean, just for the peak oil chapter alone, you've got the documents on the oil companies.
[01:58:31.809 --> 01:58:35.432]  Let's shift gears to what George Bush and his handlers really are.
[01:58:35.853 --> 01:58:45.642]  I mean, I've interviewed Ann Coulter, and I would say, well, Section 802 of the Patriot Act says that all Americans are basically terrorists, and she says, no it doesn't, you're a liar, and then she says, I haven't read the Patriot Act, but she wrote it.
[01:58:47.083 --> 01:58:52.967]  I mean, literally, I have congressmen, senators, Nobel Prize winners on, the best journalists.
[01:58:53.267 --> 01:58:57.571]  I mean, I don't consider myself to be real smart, but I have a lot of smart people on, so I'm pretty informed.
[01:58:57.971 --> 01:59:08.879]  She was one of the stupidest people I've ever talked to, and they talked about how smart she was in all this, and then she attacks the widows of 9-11 just to get publicity, and she looks like this ring-wraith type
[01:59:09.339 --> 01:59:11.500]  And again, it's not about any culture, folks.
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:14.502]  It's about the fact that Time Magazine, everybody promotes her.
[01:59:14.862 --> 01:59:19.885]  Why are they promoting this monster who has said stuff like, we need to kill more innocent Iraqis?
[01:59:20.565 --> 01:59:22.926]  Well, it's more fun and games than distraction, Alex.
[01:59:23.227 --> 01:59:36.674]  Look, when Greg Palast goes on BBC television and says, here's the inside documents from the oil industry for Iraq, when I show you the documents on the theft of the election, when I show you the documents from inside the Homeland Security operations,
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:48.104]  Well, that's what you have on the world TV, but in the United States you've got Ann Coulter talking about the godless terrorists that were killed by the terrorists.
[01:59:49.205 --> 01:59:51.326]  So what happens is fun and games and distraction.
[01:59:51.526 --> 01:59:53.126]  It's info distraction.
[01:59:53.306 --> 01:59:54.947]  So she's meant to be over the top.
[01:59:54.967 --> 01:59:56.007]  She's a carnival barker.
[01:59:56.268 --> 01:59:56.428]  Yeah.
[01:59:56.668 --> 01:59:57.648]  No, she's part of the game.
[01:59:58.088 --> 01:59:59.089]  She's total distraction.
[02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:05.113]  Well, I never really talk about her.
[02:00:05.193 --> 02:00:07.736]  It's just that I read the... it's all lies.
[02:00:07.856 --> 02:00:11.541]  And, I mean, at the same time, there's a lot of horrible stuff liberals are doing, their establishment.
[02:00:11.601 --> 02:00:12.642]  I'm not a liberal, folks.
[02:00:12.902 --> 02:00:14.083]  I'm a paleo-conservative.
[02:00:14.123 --> 02:00:15.145]  I mean, I'm a constitutionalist.
[02:00:15.165 --> 02:00:16.887]  But by any yardstick, Bush
[02:00:17.427 --> 02:00:32.332]  Has spent more money than all presidents combined, he's doubled the size of the BATF, signed back on to UN treaties, done all these things for totally open borders, he constantly lies, and still so-called conservatives worship him and worship Ann Coulter, who's a low-grade moron!
[02:00:32.732 --> 02:00:37.913]  Well, I mean, what she is, is she is a front person for the control regime.
[02:00:38.554 --> 02:00:42.755]  What she is selling us is the whole, she's bringing back the whole fear agenda.
[02:00:43.286 --> 02:00:43.826]  That's what they are.
[02:00:43.886 --> 02:00:45.027]  These are fear salesmen.
[02:00:45.287 --> 02:00:46.448]  That's what they're trying to sell you.
[02:00:46.528 --> 02:00:48.069]  Be afraid.
[02:00:48.509 --> 02:00:49.270]  That's what they want you to do.
[02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:50.931]  Well, I am afraid of the government, not them.
[02:00:50.971 --> 02:00:53.692]  Yeah, but that's why I call the first chapter, Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?
[02:00:54.012 --> 02:00:54.533]  It's a game.
[02:00:54.553 --> 02:00:56.794]  They've got a guy in a cave who's out to get you.
[02:00:56.814 --> 02:01:03.058]  Well, we have Buzzy Crongaard, who was Executive Director of the CIA, telling the Times of London, Oh, we know where he is, but we don't want him.
[02:01:03.358 --> 02:01:03.938]  Did you see that?
[02:01:04.359 --> 02:01:07.821]  Well, you know, look, Clinton turned him down when they had him cornered in cartoon.
[02:01:08.641 --> 02:01:09.642]  You have to remember that
[02:01:11.195 --> 02:01:18.118]  You know, once again, the guy that's holding all our lists is this guy, Derek Smith, who's chairman of Choice Point Corporation.
[02:01:18.138 --> 02:01:32.343]  By the way, he's now under investigation for insider trading for failing to tell his stockholders that his company had given out 145,000 personal files to identity thieves, a ring of identity thieves.
[02:01:32.363 --> 02:01:33.504]  These are really nice guys, right?
[02:01:34.284 --> 02:01:39.686]  So, what's happened is that he said, you know, if we only had these lists of Americans, and your DNA, too,
[02:01:40.313 --> 02:01:44.697]  We could have gotten the hijackers when they came to the airports to check in.
[02:01:45.077 --> 02:01:45.938]  Well, guys, you know what?
[02:01:46.138 --> 02:01:49.742]  Hijackers no longer use their names even if they lose their frequent flyer miles.
[02:01:50.362 --> 02:01:51.203]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:01:51.223 --> 02:01:52.504]  They said, well, you know, they use their real names.
[02:01:52.524 --> 02:01:55.247]  And if we only had the big databases, we could have got them.
[02:01:56.447 --> 02:02:00.909]  Well, number one, they had those databases to begin with, so we know the NSA picked it all up.
[02:02:01.269 --> 02:02:03.470]  Bush spiked it with W1999.
[02:02:03.730 --> 02:02:09.772]  That's in BBC News, and still people are in denial, even when FBI agents go public saying, I was ordered not to stop these people.
[02:02:09.993 --> 02:02:15.715]  We have FBI agents on the record saying it, and I've got Neocon Talk Show hosts going, Alex Jones manufactured all this.
[02:02:15.875 --> 02:02:20.757]  Do you ever get tired of having the actual admissions and documents, and then they're saying it doesn't matter, it doesn't exist?
[02:02:20.937 --> 02:02:23.498]  I know, they say, well, your unprovable conspiracy theories.
[02:02:23.558 --> 02:02:26.079]  They say it's the facts and documents we put on BBC television.
[02:02:26.099 --> 02:02:29.521]  My God, it's the number one stature network on the planet.
[02:02:29.601 --> 02:02:30.281]  What do you want from me?
[02:02:31.081 --> 02:02:31.842]  They still won't put it on.
[02:02:32.682 --> 02:02:36.083]  The New York Times says it's conspiracy material.
[02:02:36.104 --> 02:02:39.105]  Well, the New York Times tells conspiracies about aluminum tubes and yellow cake.
[02:02:39.705 --> 02:02:41.606]  Yeah, well that's official.
[02:02:41.726 --> 02:02:43.867]  They're the ones with reporters on the payroll of the government.
[02:02:45.638 --> 02:02:52.465]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.785 --> 02:02:54.167]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.367 --> 02:02:56.569]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.729 --> 02:02:58.811]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.072 --> 02:03:04.036]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.357 --> 02:03:08.381]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.621 --> 02:03:10.403]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:21.131]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.271 --> 02:03:23.173]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:04:03.091 --> 02:04:10.995]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.415 --> 02:04:16.757]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:04:16.917 --> 02:04:20.678]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.059 --> 02:04:22.899]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.

[02:05:18.473 --> 02:05:18.873]  I think.
[02:05:46.252 --> 02:05:48.434]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.014 --> 02:05:51.876]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.377 --> 02:05:55.258]  Final segment with Greg Pallas.
[02:05:55.278 --> 02:05:57.140]  We're going to be taking your calls here in just a minute or two.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:00.722]  And Greg's got to go catch a plane for a big event he's going to be having in Houston.
[02:06:03.524 --> 02:06:08.788]  My last question for you before we go to calls, and you can add anything else you'd like that you haven't had a chance to cover,
[02:06:10.203 --> 02:06:11.625]  Really, where is it all going?
[02:06:11.665 --> 02:06:13.167]  Will these guys ever get in peace?
[02:06:13.227 --> 02:06:14.169]  Will they go to jail?
[02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.890]  Will they get in trouble?
[02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:25.965]  Because I've studied American history, I've studied world history, I don't claim to be a historian, but I know quite a bit about it, more than most, and I've never, and I mean this, folks, you know I hate Bill Clinton, attacking ceaselessly so did Greg,
[02:06:26.585 --> 02:06:30.506]  I mean, all these guys have been serious crooks in the past, really since they killed Kennedy.
[02:06:30.526 --> 02:06:31.867]  And there were some crooks before them.
[02:06:31.907 --> 02:06:45.150]  But the wild level, I don't know if you saw this, Greg, but John Yoo, White House Counsel, says we can torture kids in front of their parents, crushing their... And I keep bringing that up on the show because he got confronted at a CFR meeting in Chicago.
[02:06:45.170 --> 02:06:48.651]  Even CFR members, the establishment guys, said, did you really say this?
[02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:49.231]  This is evil.
[02:06:49.652 --> 02:06:51.072]  And John Yoo said, yes, we can.
[02:06:51.092 --> 02:06:54.073]  I mean, it seems like... I think they were worried that he was saying it out loud.
[02:06:55.053 --> 02:06:57.294]  I don't understand!
[02:06:57.714 --> 02:06:58.714]  Listen, moron!
[02:06:58.894 --> 02:07:02.755]  If you're going to go crush people's hands, you don't announce that it's the policy.
[02:07:03.995 --> 02:07:05.675]  These guys are like amateur torturers.
[02:07:05.935 --> 02:07:06.655]  But I mean, kids!
[02:07:07.415 --> 02:07:11.916]  His White House memo was, we can torture children in front of their parents, including... I don't want to say it again.
[02:07:11.936 --> 02:07:15.277]  The point is, is that that is Mingala stuff out in the open.
[02:07:15.857 --> 02:07:18.078]  That does scare me at a certain level.
[02:07:18.198 --> 02:07:20.298]  It shocks me that it's so over the top.
[02:07:21.115 --> 02:07:26.561]  Yeah, well in fact I think that some of the establishment, there is this internal battle we talked about between Neocons and Big Oil.
[02:07:26.601 --> 02:07:28.944]  Big Oil wants a much more sophisticated approach.
[02:07:30.365 --> 02:07:41.337]  I think they're getting a bit nervous about this stuff and that's why I was picking up out of Houston and out of New York from the guys on the inside that they were not too happy about some of this cowboy stuff that's
[02:07:41.397 --> 02:07:45.338]  Well, you can see the media, for the first two years after 9-11, they gave Bush carte blanche.
[02:07:45.378 --> 02:07:46.278]  They thought he was getting away.
[02:07:46.298 --> 02:07:47.239]  Okay, the plan's working.
[02:07:47.499 --> 02:07:51.400]  And I think as they saw things get crazier and crazier, now the media is allowed to say a little bit more.
[02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:54.060]  But on little side issues, is that to weaken Bush?
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:54.901]  Yeah.
[02:07:55.041 --> 02:08:00.402]  I mean, well, one of the things is to give a shot to him and make sure he doesn't play too many games with the neocons.
[02:08:00.442 --> 02:08:02.983]  I mean, you know, after all, Paul Wolfowitz was basically demoted.
[02:08:03.003 --> 02:08:08.244]  I mean, he was kicked out of the war room where, you know, where the little Tinker Toy Napoleons play with the toy tanks.
[02:08:08.928 --> 02:08:12.230]  And he was sent to be president of the World Bank, which, in their world, is a demotion.
[02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:19.656]  Of course, now, instead of the World Bank, this guy has just been absolutely, totally monstrous.
[02:08:19.796 --> 02:08:22.758]  By the way, the New York Times has a glowing profile about how everyone loves him.
[02:08:23.258 --> 02:08:24.699]  I mean, you have no idea!
[02:08:24.719 --> 02:08:30.924]  I mean, he told Ecuador, if they didn't pay off these speculators, that he was going to choke the economy to death.
[02:08:31.344 --> 02:08:32.965]  And we've got Bolton at the UN.
[02:08:32.985 --> 02:08:34.985]  I mean, what's wrong with these guys?
[02:08:35.265 --> 02:08:42.847]  Well, but keep in mind, from the CFR's view, was thrilled that Wolfowitz had sent the World Bank and Bolton sent up to New York.
[02:08:42.867 --> 02:08:45.268]  As far as they're concerned, that was away from the centers of power.
[02:08:45.288 --> 02:08:49.529]  Well, I want to go to the call since we're almost out of time, but the last thing that I thought of, the Cheney shooting.
[02:08:49.569 --> 02:08:50.950]  We did an investigation on that.
[02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:52.430]  He clearly shot the guy up close.
[02:08:52.710 --> 02:08:53.731]  He clearly was drinking.
[02:08:53.751 --> 02:08:54.691]  They then had to admit it.
[02:08:55.251 --> 02:08:56.892]  If anybody else did that, they'd be in big trouble.
[02:08:56.912 --> 02:08:58.072]  They wouldn't let the police in.
[02:08:58.432 --> 02:09:01.033]  Just give us, in a nutshell, your take on the whole Cheney shooting.
[02:09:01.414 --> 02:09:04.015]  Well, you know, one of the problems is, I mean, I was down here.
[02:09:04.115 --> 02:09:06.556]  I'm going to be investigating that, by the way, just so you know.
[02:09:06.576 --> 02:09:08.976]  I probably shouldn't even announce that out of the air, but I'm going to get some more information.
[02:09:08.996 --> 02:09:11.858]  But all I do know is that, absolutely, I mean, what the heck is this?
[02:09:11.898 --> 02:09:15.139]  Someone gets shot, and I don't care if the guy's Vice President of the United States, what do we now have?
[02:09:15.879 --> 02:09:17.700]  We now allow personal executions by our...
[02:09:18.908 --> 02:09:19.608]  By our leadership?
[02:09:19.668 --> 02:09:26.710]  I guess Gunz also writes some type of law that says that, you know, that as long as the Vice President is packing, whatever he does is okay.
[02:09:27.010 --> 02:09:29.551]  I mean, it's gone completely bonkers.
[02:09:29.651 --> 02:09:31.192]  Well, just so you know, I've done a lot of bird hunting.
[02:09:32.132 --> 02:09:40.954]  He wasn't the 90 feet away that they claim, because even with the most high-powered shotgun load, it doesn't go into the heart of that range.
[02:09:41.735 --> 02:09:42.795]  It might go in half an inch.
[02:09:43.317 --> 02:09:45.197]  So, it's just total baloney.
[02:09:45.837 --> 02:09:47.558]  Let's take a call here from Mike in New York.
[02:09:47.578 --> 02:09:49.198]  We're on the air with Greg Palast on Genesis.
[02:09:49.938 --> 02:09:51.519]  Oh, you guys got me all worked up now.
[02:09:52.199 --> 02:09:52.599]  Okay, Mike.
[02:09:52.819 --> 02:09:53.599]  Greg, here's the thing.
[02:09:54.259 --> 02:10:03.801]  Pre-September 11th, my understanding is Breda's Corp out of Argentina had to deal with the Taliban for taking the oil pipeline through that country of Afghanistan.
[02:10:03.941 --> 02:10:04.381]  UNICAL.
[02:10:04.901 --> 02:10:06.081]  UNICAL, correct.
[02:10:06.341 --> 02:10:08.022]  And obviously after September 11th.
[02:10:08.042 --> 02:10:09.402]  I also understand that UNICAL
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.221]  During that time frame was lobbying Congress.
[02:10:12.481 --> 02:10:13.501]  Yeah, I always call them Unical.
[02:10:13.521 --> 02:10:14.161]  That's the thing.
[02:10:14.221 --> 02:10:15.241]  It's like stuck in my head.
[02:10:15.301 --> 02:10:16.441]  It's Unical.
[02:10:16.461 --> 02:10:17.802]  Like UNOCAL, I guess, right?
[02:10:17.902 --> 02:10:18.942]  U-N-O-C-A-L?
[02:10:19.282 --> 02:10:19.442]  Yeah.
[02:10:19.862 --> 02:10:24.563]  They were lobbying Congress to establish some foreign policy because they actually wanted the deal.
[02:10:24.943 --> 02:10:31.845]  Obviously, September 11th came, British Corps contract with the Taliban was null and void, obviously, and Unical won the day.
[02:10:32.435 --> 02:10:34.777]  He was on the board and then he becomes the puppet president.
[02:10:34.797 --> 02:10:35.277]  That was all staged.
[02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.711]  To Iraq.
[02:10:50.791 --> 02:10:55.653]  When you say ambassador, you have to understand this guy is basically the dictator and overlord of Iraq.
[02:10:55.673 --> 02:10:56.894]  What about Ahmed Chalabi?
[02:10:56.914 --> 02:10:58.895]  He was at the Bilderberg Group meeting last week.
[02:10:59.415 --> 02:11:02.297]  He can't even go to a bunch of countries because he's a convicted felon.
[02:11:02.377 --> 02:11:03.558]  Yeah, he's a convicted bank swindler.
[02:11:03.858 --> 02:11:05.358]  Convicted bank swindler.
[02:11:05.399 --> 02:11:07.340]  He wanted Interpol.
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:09.281]  This guy took down the Petrus Bank.
[02:11:10.181 --> 02:11:13.503]  Also, when Chalabi, that we installed,
[02:11:14.295 --> 02:11:16.836]  He named himself oil minister in Iraq.
[02:11:17.196 --> 02:11:21.017]  We're still trying to find out what happened to about a billion and a half to two billion dollars worth of oil.
[02:11:22.457 --> 02:11:23.117]  These are crooks.
[02:11:23.477 --> 02:11:24.457]  Hey, listen, thanks for the call.
[02:11:24.477 --> 02:11:25.998]  I appreciate those fine points, Mike.
[02:11:26.698 --> 02:11:28.698]  Let's talk to Sarah Jo in New York.
[02:11:28.738 --> 02:11:29.539]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:11:30.199 --> 02:11:30.739]  Yes, hi.
[02:11:30.839 --> 02:11:35.220]  First of all, I just want to, from the onset, state my position.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:36.560]  I do not support Bush.
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.661]  But I'm rather tired of the idolization of Chavez.
[02:11:41.230 --> 02:11:46.194]  Anyone who's against Bush seems to be admired, and Chavez is not to be admired.
[02:11:46.314 --> 02:11:52.379]  I know you supposedly had a meeting with him and all, but I lived in Venezuela for many years.
[02:11:52.439 --> 02:11:55.582]  I have friends and family in Venezuela, even as we speak.
[02:11:56.303 --> 02:11:57.183]  The place is a mess.
[02:11:57.644 --> 02:12:02.308]  Chavez has done nothing except make it worse, okay?
[02:12:02.488 --> 02:12:04.710]  With other administrations, it wasn't the greatest.
[02:12:08.278 --> 02:12:13.342]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but he did give people back land that had been taken by old companies.
[02:12:13.362 --> 02:12:16.265]  He's actually giving, with a deed, people their land.
[02:12:17.346 --> 02:12:21.670]  He's a communist for that, but Bush is good with the Supreme Court ruling we don't own our private properties.
[02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:23.292]  I'm just trying to understand this.
[02:12:24.093 --> 02:12:26.014]  Let me just respond here.
[02:12:26.655 --> 02:12:29.698]  Number one, let's not fall in love with any politician anywhere.
[02:12:30.662 --> 02:12:33.643]  Obviously, Chavez is acting in his own interest, his own political interest.
[02:12:34.224 --> 02:12:47.949]  The fact is, and even the people who hate him and despise him down in Venezuela will say that he has turned those cardboard houses into brick-and-mortar houses and that people are, of all classes, are now way, way, way better off than they ever were.
[02:12:48.289 --> 02:12:51.791]  For the first time ever, an oil boom money is going back down to the people.
[02:12:52.855 --> 02:12:55.157]  Let me just understand this.
[02:12:55.217 --> 02:12:55.877]  What should we do?
[02:12:55.937 --> 02:12:58.799]  Should we maybe make Pat Robertson Vice Roy?
[02:12:58.859 --> 02:13:00.440]  I mean, what should happen?
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:03.681]  You're saying that he's... They elected him, you know, that he's the elected president.
[02:13:03.721 --> 02:13:11.646]  And so therefore you have to reckon, you know, for the United States to be clearly, deliberately trying to overthrow an elected president.
[02:13:11.986 --> 02:13:15.968]  And believe me, let's get away from the baloney that he wasn't elected.
[02:13:16.148 --> 02:13:17.649]  I went with his opponent.
[02:13:17.909 --> 02:13:19.330]  The guy's running against him for president.
[02:13:19.630 --> 02:13:20.651]  He's actually a nice guy.
[02:13:21.314 --> 02:13:22.341]  A guy named Julio Borges.
[02:13:22.381 --> 02:13:23.246]  I like his opponent a lot.
[02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:25.931]  But, you know, we went to a little town.
[02:13:26.272 --> 02:13:27.373]  We found one supporter.
[02:13:27.693 --> 02:13:33.097]  I went the next day to the very same town with the President, and you thought that Elvis had arrived, man.
[02:13:33.137 --> 02:13:35.279]  Ma'am, I mean, specifically, what's your point?
[02:13:35.319 --> 02:13:35.859]  What should happen?
[02:13:35.899 --> 02:13:36.480]  What are you saying?
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:43.705]  Well, the only thing I'm saying right now is that, like you said, Chavez is doing it for his own interest, and the people are not.
[02:13:43.765 --> 02:13:45.787]  They are taking land away from people.
[02:13:45.807 --> 02:13:47.328]  They're not giving them land and deeds.
[02:13:47.428 --> 02:13:51.431]  What they're doing is taking the people who live in the shacks up on the hills.
[02:13:52.292 --> 02:13:53.153]  They're illegal
[02:13:53.632 --> 02:13:58.196]  Well, I just think to give China... You don't want to assassinate an elected president, do you?
[02:14:14.551 --> 02:14:17.773]  No, I'm not saying that, but you say that they were not fair elections.
[02:14:17.793 --> 02:14:21.336]  I was down there for much of the demonstrations.
[02:14:21.716 --> 02:14:23.918]  I saw the whole country.
[02:14:24.018 --> 02:14:26.319]  My point is that it's making the globalists mad.
[02:14:27.781 --> 02:14:28.841]  Our government loves China.
[02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:32.624]  They've got mobile execution vans and public executions and sell organs.
[02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:37.087]  So Chavez, compared to them, he's much better than China and he's much better than our government.
[02:14:37.267 --> 02:14:37.868]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:38.548 --> 02:14:39.589]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:14:39.789 --> 02:14:44.571]  Yeah, I mean China, we are cuddling up to the most bloodthirsty dictator in the planet.
[02:14:44.611 --> 02:14:48.213]  I mean North Korea is threatening to nuke us and we're giving them reactors and Rumsfeld's involved in that of course.
[02:14:48.554 --> 02:14:50.775]  Mike in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:14:51.115 --> 02:14:51.495]  Hi guys.
[02:14:51.875 --> 02:14:52.636]  Hi.
[02:14:52.676 --> 02:14:55.377]  Two questions, one for you Greg, one for you Alex.
[02:14:55.397 --> 02:14:59.780]  Greg, what I hear and what I sense is that there's a
[02:15:01.266 --> 02:15:06.008]  An effort to consolidate South America so as to cause problems for the New World Order.
[02:15:06.028 --> 02:15:07.729]  Can you comment on that?
[02:15:07.869 --> 02:15:10.230]  And Alex, can you comment on this?
[02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:20.514]  I think I heard on your show where somebody was saying that you were agreeing that World Vision, this Christian organization, as well as other leaders like Pat Robertson, John Hagee, others,
[02:15:21.292 --> 02:15:26.873]  Are really not, especially World Vision, being operated by the CIA?
[02:15:26.913 --> 02:15:28.934]  Yes, I appreciate your call.
[02:15:29.274 --> 02:15:33.535]  A lot of them are paid off, a lot of them are co-opted, some of them are actual government operations.
[02:15:33.835 --> 02:15:34.895]  We have documents on that.
[02:15:34.935 --> 02:15:37.256]  You want to take that question and then answer his first one?
[02:15:37.516 --> 02:15:37.736]  Okay.
[02:15:38.076 --> 02:15:40.937]  Well, the first question about what's happening in South America.
[02:15:42.037 --> 02:15:45.479]  Hugo Chavez has said we have to end the dictatorship of the IMF.
[02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:47.180]  The IMF has got to go.
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.441]  And we have our own documents saying we want to overthrow countries.
[02:15:49.641 --> 02:15:49.821]  Right.
[02:15:49.881 --> 02:15:52.283]  So he's saying, you know, we can't operate this way.
[02:15:52.343 --> 02:15:54.184]  We're basically being bled to death.
[02:15:54.784 --> 02:16:01.267]  But that means that he's had to take money out of the US Federal Reserve and lent it into Argentina so that Argentina told the IMF to fly.
[02:16:01.307 --> 02:16:02.148]  He lent it to Ecuador.
[02:16:02.988 --> 02:16:04.809]  Ecuador told the IMF to fly.
[02:16:05.695 --> 02:16:10.640]  And he's lending, in other words, he's replacing the IMF with his nation's oil money.
[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:16.465]  Now, they're not doing badly, because what happens is these nations, he lends the money to these nations and they get up off the ground.
[02:16:16.505 --> 02:16:19.007]  He's actually made like 70 million bucks for his nation off the ground.
[02:16:19.067 --> 02:16:22.690]  And so they're getting into... Right, but they're independent then.
[02:16:22.730 --> 02:16:26.874]  What about using fake conservative Christian groups as government fronts?
[02:16:27.094 --> 02:16:28.616]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's the other thing.
[02:16:28.636 --> 02:16:30.978]  You know, I met with Pat Robertson
[02:16:31.551 --> 02:16:32.852]  And I wore a wire then, too.
[02:16:32.872 --> 02:16:37.576]  By the way, the way I got around his metal detector, I told his guard, I said, could you hold my lighter for me?
[02:16:38.036 --> 02:16:39.257]  It'll just set off the alarm.
[02:16:40.498 --> 02:16:41.739]  And he gave it back to me the other time.
[02:16:41.759 --> 02:16:43.821]  He didn't notice I didn't have any cigarettes, you know?
[02:16:44.241 --> 02:16:49.505]  But, you know, so Robertson told me, it's on tape, I'm not a televangelist.
[02:16:50.242 --> 02:16:51.283]  I'm a businessman.
[02:16:51.743 --> 02:16:53.624]  This is business, man.
[02:16:53.944 --> 02:16:55.925]  This is all about the money.
[02:16:55.985 --> 02:16:58.007]  He owned, at one time, like 30 TV stations.
[02:16:58.067 --> 02:16:59.527]  Now it's billions.
[02:16:59.707 --> 02:17:02.929]  Yeah, at least I figure he's worth a good half billion anyway.
[02:17:02.949 --> 02:17:04.991]  I mean, this guy, there is no buying.
[02:17:05.011 --> 02:17:06.231]  I mean, his assets are billions.
[02:17:06.291 --> 02:17:08.152]  Yeah, I mean, it's huge.
[02:17:08.953 --> 02:17:11.995]  And he's got Diamond Mind operating out of the Congo.
[02:17:12.015 --> 02:17:12.595]  With slaves.
[02:17:12.995 --> 02:17:14.136]  He can't do that stuff.
[02:17:14.156 --> 02:17:17.738]  He can't cut deals with guys like Mobutu without having CIA support.
[02:17:18.218 --> 02:17:19.479]  Hey, we're out of time, Greg Pallis.
[02:17:19.499 --> 02:17:23.523]  The new book, Armed Man House, already on the New York Times Best Seller list in stores everywhere.
[02:17:23.924 --> 02:17:24.484]  I want to carry it.
[02:17:24.604 --> 02:17:25.925]  I appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:17:25.966 --> 02:17:26.566]  It's always great.
[02:17:26.586 --> 02:17:30.049]  And next time you kind of orbit through our area, I want to have you back in studio again, Greg.
[02:17:30.149 --> 02:17:30.870]  You got it, Alex.
[02:17:31.411 --> 02:17:31.831]  That was great.
[02:17:31.851 --> 02:17:33.012]  I think we covered a lot of the bases.
[02:17:33.052 --> 02:17:33.613]  Sorry, crawlers.
[02:17:33.653 --> 02:17:34.934]  I'll come back and go to you after the break.
[02:17:34.954 --> 02:17:35.394]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:35.454 --> 02:17:39.098]  Greg, again, good seeing you.
[02:17:39.218 --> 02:17:39.879]  You're the man, Alex.
[02:17:40.079 --> 02:17:40.379]  No, no.
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:41.240]  You're the man.
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:42.081]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.227 --> 02:17:48.789]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:50.670]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:17:50.810 --> 02:17:56.593]  A tornado is an easy to install, maintenance free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:17:56.893 --> 02:18:03.997]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[02:18:04.137 --> 02:18:08.920]  With today's gas prices it makes sense to cage the gas saving power of a tornado.
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:14.623]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your tornado at Checkers, Shucks and Cragen today!
[02:18:16.585 --> 02:18:20.326]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:18:20.586 --> 02:18:25.367]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:18:25.387 --> 02:18:27.148]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:18:27.408 --> 02:18:27.628]  No.
[02:18:27.968 --> 02:18:31.729]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:18:32.129 --> 02:18:33.469]  Are all covers the same?
[02:18:33.729 --> 02:18:33.969]  No.
[02:18:34.229 --> 02:18:37.930]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:18:38.310 --> 02:18:40.451]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:18:40.731 --> 02:18:43.251]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[02:18:43.532 --> 02:18:45.312]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:18:47.621 --> 02:18:48.662]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.062 --> 02:18:54.547]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.107 --> 02:18:55.628]  That's right.
[02:18:55.928 --> 02:18:58.230]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:05.696]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.255 --> 02:19:13.963]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.403 --> 02:19:19.208]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.881 --> 02:19:24.583]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.684 --> 02:19:29.825]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.205 --> 02:19:30.466]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.506 --> 02:19:32.406]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.466 --> 02:19:32.747]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.067 --> 02:19:33.347]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.922 --> 02:19:47.543]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:47.683 --> 02:19:51.786]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.926 --> 02:19:54.788]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.888 --> 02:20:01.593]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.773 --> 02:20:04.776]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:07.377]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.518 --> 02:20:12.221]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:20:12.401 --> 02:20:26.971]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:20:27.131 --> 02:20:33.195]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:20:33.475 --> 02:20:33.935]  Or order on the web
[02:20:45.802 --> 02:20:48.122]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[02:20:48.622 --> 02:20:51.483]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[02:20:52.403 --> 02:21:02.066]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[02:21:02.986 --> 02:21:08.147]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[02:21:08.931 --> 02:21:19.755]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[02:21:20.395 --> 02:21:22.896]  Star War technology at its best.

[02:21:40.226 --> 02:21:41.147]  Or call 792-953-0267.
[02:21:41.207 --> 02:21:55.872]  Alright, let's go back to your calls.
[02:21:56.692 --> 02:21:58.913]  Kenneth in Louisiana, sorry you couldn't talk to Greg.
[02:21:59.273 --> 02:21:59.913]  You're on the air.
[02:21:59.933 --> 02:22:02.194]  Yes, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:22:02.314 --> 02:22:02.494]  Good.
[02:22:04.123 --> 02:22:11.405]  People like Ann Coulter and John Hagee, their nationalism is internationalism.
[02:22:11.505 --> 02:22:21.268]  And what I'm saying is... They claim it's nationalistic to destroy America and get rid of our nationalism.
[02:22:22.108 --> 02:22:22.508]  Exactly.
[02:22:22.528 --> 02:22:24.309]  They're nationalists in name only.
[02:22:24.329 --> 02:22:25.889]  It's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:22:26.169 --> 02:22:27.170]  It's a cloaking device.
[02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:31.931]  It's like dressing up like a cop and robbing a bank.
[02:22:31.991 --> 02:22:40.634]  These same people who don't like the terrorists, they were for the ANC in the 1980s overthrow a white Christian government in South Africa.
[02:22:42.765 --> 02:22:47.806]  Well, they're there to overthrow any sovereign government, anything that's independent, whether it's good, bad, or indifferent.
[02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:51.787]  I'm not judging, you know, saying whether Serbia is good or South Africa is good.
[02:22:51.827 --> 02:22:54.708]  The point is, something far worse is always brought in.
[02:22:55.628 --> 02:22:56.048]  That's it.
[02:22:57.248 --> 02:22:57.569]  Alright.
[02:22:59.169 --> 02:23:01.289]  Anything else you'd like to add, Kenneth?
[02:23:01.329 --> 02:23:02.130]  No, that's it.
[02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.550]  Good show.
[02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:03.830]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:04.330 --> 02:23:07.971]  And while we're busy talking about all these issues, I know that
[02:23:08.954 --> 02:23:18.783]  The transcript of the Greg Powell's interview that we did back in 2002 in March was published in hundreds of newspapers from Italy to Caracas, Venezuela.
[02:23:19.543 --> 02:23:26.369]  And I knew that Hugo Chavez had sourced and used our interview in the media.
[02:23:26.410 --> 02:23:27.991]  I knew that it had been quoted on television.
[02:23:28.371 --> 02:23:35.878]  I didn't know that in a private meeting with Chavez that he had said that that interview was one of the things that saved him.
[02:23:36.627 --> 02:23:40.490]  Because we did it four days before, a day later it went out as a transcript.
[02:23:40.570 --> 02:23:43.012]  We got millions of readers just on our site.
[02:23:43.032 --> 02:23:45.954]  It got, quote, web syndicated, posted on thousands of other sites.
[02:23:46.274 --> 02:23:49.037]  So see, there we are having a difference, making a difference.
[02:23:49.097 --> 02:23:50.958]  And I'm not saying Hugo Chavez is perfect.
[02:23:51.599 --> 02:23:53.800]  But I think Greg Powell has got his head screwed on pretty straight.
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:58.904]  He impressed me today about how it looks like Ahmed Dinejad may be a globalist operative.
[02:23:58.924 --> 02:24:00.685]  At the bare minimum, he's playing along.
[02:24:01.826 --> 02:24:03.868]  And, you know, he's saying that Chavez isn't.
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:09.223]  I mean, they've had him at gunpoint on a helicopter about to kill him, and it got out in the news, so they had to release him.
[02:24:10.144 --> 02:24:12.085]  I mean, this is the type of stuff we're talking about here.
[02:24:12.166 --> 02:24:17.069]  Meanwhile, our government gives nuclear reactors in North Korea, they fire a test dummy missile that hits the U.S.
[02:24:17.089 --> 02:24:27.657]  six years ago, they cover that all up, it's in Japanese and South Korean newspapers, Senate reports, confirmed, but they're okay, you know, they're fueling missiles right now to test-fire missiles at the U.S.
[02:24:27.877 --> 02:24:30.619]  to supposedly plunge into the coast off of Alaska.
[02:24:31.119 --> 02:24:36.784]  I mean, firing missiles, test firing them, doing this, this has happened, they're getting ready to do it again, but they're okay!
[02:24:37.104 --> 02:24:49.254]  They're just threatening to nuke us, they've just got A-bombs, they've got hydrogen bombs, but they're okay, but we've got to, you know, go into the Middle East and we've got to bring, quote, democracy to the Iraqis when it's the opposite of democracy.
[02:24:49.834 --> 02:24:52.537]  They're bringing bedlam and genocide and extermination to them.
[02:24:53.778 --> 02:24:55.579]  We're going to break and come back and take more calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:59.446 --> 02:25:08.531]  And it looks like we're going to have William Rodriguez, one of the heroes of 9-11, on with us here briefly because he just got back from Malaysia giving a big speech to thousands about 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:25:08.551 --> 02:25:09.551]  This is incredible stuff.
[02:25:09.811 --> 02:25:12.072]  He's going to be at our big event coming up Sunday.
[02:25:12.093 --> 02:25:13.073]  He'll be one of the key speakers.
[02:25:13.593 --> 02:25:16.935]  Saturday and Sunday at the Sheriff's in downtown LA.
[02:25:17.235 --> 02:25:22.858]  By the way, at the end of the show, depending on ticket sales, there aren't many left.
[02:25:22.978 --> 02:25:23.738]  We're pulling it.
[02:25:23.919 --> 02:25:24.599]  We're pulling it.
[02:25:24.739 --> 02:25:25.779]  It sells out at $1,100.
[02:25:27.404 --> 02:25:27.784]  Okay?
[02:25:28.144 --> 02:25:30.525]  We could stick $1,200 in there, but I'm going to leave a buffer.
[02:25:30.545 --> 02:25:33.087]  Because we're going to have so much press there.
[02:25:33.267 --> 02:25:34.567]  We can only have $1,200 in the room.
[02:25:34.607 --> 02:25:38.769]  You can have $1,400, but the stage is so big, and the projectors, and the media area.
[02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:40.390]  So the cutoff is $1,200.
[02:25:40.430 --> 02:25:43.411]  We're cutting it off $100 under $1,100.
[02:25:43.451 --> 02:25:45.312]  The tickets are basically gone right now.
[02:25:45.872 --> 02:25:47.933]  I was looking at it during a break about 20 minutes ago.
[02:25:48.453 --> 02:25:50.454]  The tickets are almost gone right now.

[02:29:47.723 --> 02:29:52.886]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[02:29:53.226 --> 02:29:54.707]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:54.807 --> 02:29:56.788]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:57.068 --> 02:30:02.572]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:02.872 --> 02:30:09.135]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.

[02:30:15.619 --> 02:30:16.019]  Whoa!
[02:30:16.419 --> 02:30:17.620]  What was that website again?
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:21.202]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:21.482 --> 02:30:22.602]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:22.742 --> 02:30:27.024]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:27.184 --> 02:30:27.765]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:28.045 --> 02:30:29.245]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:29.646 --> 02:30:30.286]  Check, please!

[02:30:46.776 --> 02:30:51.878]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.578 --> 02:30:54.959]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.500 --> 02:31:00.061]  Paul, John, John, Mike, many others, your calls are coming up here.
[02:31:01.406 --> 02:31:07.189]  In just a few minutes, I'm joined by William Rodriguez, who just got back from Asia.
[02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:09.691]  Just got back from the Far East.
[02:31:11.271 --> 02:31:13.533]  He, of course, was the key master, the head janitor.
[02:31:13.553 --> 02:31:16.134]  He stayed in the building, helping firefighters.
[02:31:16.174 --> 02:31:21.117]  He personally rescued 15 people himself, leading them in and out, going back in.
[02:31:21.157 --> 02:31:22.317]  The building collapsed on him.
[02:31:22.638 --> 02:31:26.700]  He was the last non-emergency worker to be pulled, the last, quote, civilian.
[02:31:27.486 --> 02:31:32.227]  And he'll be at the 9-11 conference speaking as one of the key speakers on Sunday.
[02:31:32.907 --> 02:31:35.788]  I'm really looking forward to shaking this man's hand.
[02:31:36.188 --> 02:31:38.369]  And he's got some good news back from Malaysia.
[02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:50.271]  He's been traveling the world with Jimmy Walter, the philanthropist, who spent over $7 million waking people up to 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:31:50.711 --> 02:31:52.672]  Good to have you on with us, Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:31:53.416 --> 02:31:56.658]  Thank you, Alex, and I'm so glad to... Greetings from New York.
[02:31:56.878 --> 02:32:09.507]  I'm actually, like I said, back from... Yeah, he's on a computer phone, and when you get him connected again, tell him to turn... to get back off his phone.
[02:32:09.907 --> 02:32:10.888]  It's distorting.
[02:32:11.728 --> 02:32:13.449]  You gotta love these IP phones.
[02:32:13.509 --> 02:32:14.790]  We've tried them here at the office.
[02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:15.771]  They're okay.
[02:32:15.791 --> 02:32:18.993]  You save a lot of money with them, but they're just not as good as a regular phone line.
[02:32:19.013 --> 02:32:20.674]  A lot of guests try to do it, and it's fine.
[02:32:21.683 --> 02:32:23.384]  But we will get him back on.
[02:32:23.844 --> 02:32:24.604]  We're able to get him back?
[02:32:25.805 --> 02:32:26.005]  Okay.
[02:32:26.345 --> 02:32:31.787]  Again, we're going to talk to him just a few minutes and then take some calls even while he's on air with us.
[02:32:33.587 --> 02:32:34.708]  This is real news, folks.
[02:32:34.728 --> 02:32:36.749]  We're bringing you all these guests that have traveled the world.
[02:32:36.769 --> 02:32:37.949]  We're bringing you these experts.
[02:32:37.989 --> 02:32:42.631]  We're in studio making TV reports out of the live radio shows.
[02:32:42.671 --> 02:32:44.551]  We're reaching millions of people.
[02:32:44.571 --> 02:32:45.872]  This is so exciting.
[02:32:46.845 --> 02:32:49.986]  I'm so honored and so blessed to be able to talk to people like William Rodriguez on air.
[02:32:50.306 --> 02:32:51.406]  William, your line dropped.
[02:32:51.546 --> 02:32:52.347]  Good to have you back with us.
[02:32:52.987 --> 02:32:53.367]  Thank you.
[02:32:53.407 --> 02:32:54.307]  Greetings from New York.
[02:32:54.527 --> 02:32:56.868]  It's been very difficult with the trip.
[02:32:57.128 --> 02:33:02.569]  We just got back from Malaysia, which this is actually an exclusive for America.
[02:33:02.789 --> 02:33:04.570]  Alex, I tell you, it was the best.
[02:33:07.225 --> 02:33:09.608]  Boy, this is getting a little suspicious.
[02:33:10.188 --> 02:33:12.110]  Call him and see if he's got an alternate phone number.
[02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:14.333]  While we're doing that, I'm going to talk to Paul in Vancouver.
[02:33:14.373 --> 02:33:15.133]  Put Paul on the air.
[02:33:15.474 --> 02:33:16.315]  Paul, you're on the air.
[02:33:16.375 --> 02:33:16.695]  Welcome.
[02:33:17.476 --> 02:33:23.162]  Yeah, sorry to change the tone there, but I just wanted to touch on the North American Union.
[02:33:25.464 --> 02:33:28.668]  I'm from Canada, and I actually think it's a good thing.
[02:33:29.355 --> 02:33:33.419]  Well, it's the first step in the Pan-American Union, but tell me how it's a good thing.
[02:33:33.459 --> 02:33:36.141]  By the way, the people pushing it that have set it up are total dictators.
[02:33:36.161 --> 02:33:37.883]  They want a dictatorship.
[02:33:37.903 --> 02:33:39.544]  They want command and control.
[02:33:39.624 --> 02:33:47.772]  It'll be an added layer of bureaucracy, and under these international bodies, you don't have the free speech, you don't have the constitutions, but you think that's a good idea.
[02:33:47.812 --> 02:33:48.512]  Tell us why, Paul.
[02:33:49.033 --> 02:33:53.457]  Okay, well, I'm no expert, and I've learned a lot from you, listening to you in the past while.
[02:33:54.276 --> 02:33:55.397]  And about the issues.
[02:33:55.997 --> 02:34:01.019]  And the way I see it is Canada has the resources.
[02:34:01.039 --> 02:34:04.361]  There's oil like crazy, you know, but we still pay $4.50 a gallon here.
[02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:06.062]  Well, that's because you're under the Crown, sir.
[02:34:06.122 --> 02:34:06.762]  It's free market.
[02:34:06.802 --> 02:34:08.203]  We can just buy the oil from you.
[02:34:08.783 --> 02:34:09.163]  That's right.
[02:34:09.343 --> 02:34:13.145]  How does an American Union give you cheaper prices?
[02:34:13.465 --> 02:34:15.326]  Okay, yeah, let me go.
[02:34:16.086 --> 02:34:17.107]  Canada has the resources.
[02:34:18.257 --> 02:34:27.003]  Mexico has the manufacturing and the laborers, and USA is basically security and other resources, food, whatnot.
[02:34:28.163 --> 02:34:32.146]  Now, why put all our money into the Chinese economy?
[02:34:32.186 --> 02:34:32.586]  Why do it?
[02:34:33.266 --> 02:34:35.368]  Their ideology is, to me, sick.
[02:34:35.848 --> 02:34:40.331]  The Alex Jones Show would not be on if we were in China right now.
[02:34:40.811 --> 02:34:46.394]  Let me stop you and comment on what you're saying one point at a time, and I'm about to go back to William, but I just want to finish with your call.
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:57.029]  Number one, the very people that support China, the very people de-industrializing Canada and the U.S., the very people doing all of this are the very ones that want the American Union.
[02:34:57.069 --> 02:35:10.964]  So how do you come to the conclusion that a North American Union is somehow going to help our economy and stop the shift to buying everything from China?
[02:35:12.223 --> 02:35:19.210]  Because we'll be investing, if we invest in our own state, our North American state, where we get all our manufacturing from Mexico.
[02:35:19.290 --> 02:35:20.591]  Sir, they're not going to do that.
[02:35:20.651 --> 02:35:23.934]  I mean, you're saying, let's have an American Union, and then let's do some good things.
[02:35:24.194 --> 02:35:28.478]  The people that are running the American Union are the ones that have set up the policy with China.
[02:35:29.259 --> 02:35:33.503]  Well, I mean, the Constitution hasn't been set, but we can make sure there are fair rules in place.
[02:35:34.005 --> 02:35:35.086]  That's not going to happen, sir.
[02:35:35.106 --> 02:35:43.532]  The people driving unions, the American Union, the EU, the Asian Union, are the ones that want to destroy our sovereignty.
[02:35:43.732 --> 02:35:48.336]  I'm going to put you on hold, and after William Rodriguez leaves us, we'll go back to you, because I'm not going to have William on long.
[02:35:48.376 --> 02:35:48.976]  I know he's busy.
[02:35:49.217 --> 02:35:49.897]  He just got back.
[02:35:50.197 --> 02:35:52.179]  William, give us the good news.
[02:35:52.219 --> 02:35:53.099]  You were there in Malaysia.
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:53.640]  Tell us about it.
[02:35:54.127 --> 02:35:58.348]  Great news, actually, this is an exclusive from America, and you have the exclusive.
[02:35:58.668 --> 02:36:13.270]  We just got back from the International Islamic Media, the first one ever done in the world, and we were the special keynote speakers, and I tell you something, it changed the mindset of the Malaysian people forever.
[02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:19.191]  We were on TV every single day for the last 10 days.
[02:36:19.671 --> 02:36:22.732]  Our video was presented in snippets.
[02:36:23.294 --> 02:36:27.637]  On national prime time news, every single day at 8 o'clock.
[02:36:27.997 --> 02:36:36.784]  And we have meetings with the Prime Minister, the former Prime Minister Dr. Tun Mahathirak, which was the father of Malaysia.
[02:36:37.084 --> 02:36:41.427]  And William, I need you to back off the phone there, it's distorting.
[02:36:41.727 --> 02:36:45.790]  Now, doesn't Malaysia, I'm just striking out here in the dark because I forget, aren't there like 160 million people?
[02:36:47.851 --> 02:36:48.572]  That is correct.
[02:36:48.712 --> 02:36:55.800]  And not only that, remember, it's the largest Muslim country that has all three religions actually in there.
[02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:58.843]  They've got Christians, they've got Muslims, and they've got Buddhists.
[02:36:59.544 --> 02:37:06.291]  And I tell you something, it was a historical, historical event, because it was the first time they had a 9-11 victim.
[02:37:07.611 --> 02:37:21.318]  Come directly to the Muslim world, tell them my story, for example, tell them my story, and at the same time do the outreach so they will know that we're actually not blaming the Muslim or Islam for what happened on 9-11.
[02:37:21.619 --> 02:37:25.961]  And that was actually... Well, tell us who you talked to, what you presented.
[02:37:27.077 --> 02:37:34.001]  We talked, actually we did the conference with all the highest protocol people from the government.
[02:37:34.221 --> 02:37:38.224]  We're talking about the Minister of Foreign Relations.
[02:37:38.644 --> 02:37:50.210]  We spoke to Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, as a new progressive country.
[02:37:51.051 --> 02:37:56.094]  We spoke directly to people from their version of Congress and
[02:37:56.653 --> 02:38:14.321]  The incredible thing that after we went on every television show, on Friday, they have a hundred people in front of the American Embassy, just by themselves, actually asking, requesting that the 9-11 Truth be told.
[02:38:14.341 --> 02:38:16.322]  They actually gave a paper to the Ambassador.
[02:38:21.994 --> 02:38:45.013]  I think what you and Jimmy Walter are doing, traveling the world, going all over TV, all over radio, all over print, getting top covered from Venezuela to Malaysia to Europe, I think what you're doing is key, and so if half the Americans in major polls now believe 9-11 was an inside job, not that the government covered up or did something else, no, half of them now in a Zogby poll believe the government was involved,
[02:38:46.153 --> 02:38:48.655]  What are the numbers in these foreign countries you're going to?
[02:38:49.775 --> 02:38:52.697]  Listen, from here we're going to Indonesia.
[02:38:53.017 --> 02:39:01.301]  From Indonesia we're going to Australia, then Japan, then back to London, and then back to the United States.
[02:39:01.501 --> 02:39:05.923]  And then we have to go back to Venezuela where we started the whole trip.
[02:39:06.003 --> 02:39:11.585]  As you may remember, you got the exclusive as well from the Chavez government that they want to do an investigation about 9-11.
[02:39:11.866 --> 02:39:14.567]  So now we are having this international consensus
[02:39:14.947 --> 02:39:21.550]  That crimes against humanity happened on 9-11, and that the government of the United States did not do the proper investigation.
[02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:33.896]  So, with this as a presentation letter to the top officials of both these governments... Well, just a... Just a, just a guesstimation, William Rodriguez.
[02:39:35.256 --> 02:39:35.977]  Did he drop again?
[02:39:35.997 --> 02:39:37.857]  No, I'm here, I'm here.
[02:39:38.338 --> 02:39:38.758]  Okay, good.
[02:39:39.158 --> 02:39:43.520]  Just a guesstimation, William, what percentage of the Malaysians do you think believe it's an inside job?
[02:39:44.312 --> 02:39:56.316]  I tell you easier, what they said on national television was the following statement, and don't take my word for it, go on the internet, put William Rodriguez, 9-11, Kuala Lumpur, and you get all the information.
[02:39:56.616 --> 02:40:07.539]  He said that since we went to Malaysia, to Kuala Lumpur, the mindset of the Malaysian people about 9-11 has changed forever.
[02:40:07.559 --> 02:40:09.740]  And this is the national news.
[02:40:10.464 --> 02:40:25.154]  So, that will tell you that the mindset in general... Remember, we are invited by Saba Islamic Media, which is the biggest Islamic organization, to do this presentation.
[02:40:25.274 --> 02:40:33.559]  And, like I said, it was historical, and now they want to represent us all over the Muslim world to take us around to tell the story.
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:35.841]  And, again, historical.
[02:40:36.741 --> 02:40:41.145]  Well, the globalists can't ignore this, and they're losing ground at every front, and we're trying to save lives, people.
[02:40:41.165 --> 02:40:49.914]  If we don't expose 9-11 as an inside job, they will continue to use it as a foundational event to push the domestic police state and the invasion of all these countries.
[02:40:50.235 --> 02:41:00.485]  William, I know you just got... And Alex, you said something very interesting, because now Malaysia, the government itself, states publicly that they are joining the World Against Terror.
[02:41:00.905 --> 02:41:10.472]  And what we explained to the people, directly to the people, was that they are actually being open to have the same violation of civil rights as it happened in the United States.
[02:41:11.452 --> 02:41:13.454]  Wow, so you're also there defending their freedom.
[02:41:13.494 --> 02:41:21.179]  Certainly, governments worldwide have been using 9-11 themselves to set up police states, so you're really defending freedom globally now.
[02:41:21.359 --> 02:41:22.920]  How many countries have you been to, William?
[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:24.161]  Oh, forget it.
[02:41:24.181 --> 02:41:25.341]  I love to count, Alex.
[02:41:25.622 --> 02:41:26.222]  But you know what?
[02:41:26.442 --> 02:41:28.924]  I want to tell the audience to please come on
[02:41:29.386 --> 02:41:36.291]  This weekend, because if they haven't heard my story, they are for a big awakening.
[02:41:36.491 --> 02:41:38.752]  It's going to be sold out in the next 30 to 45 minutes.
[02:41:38.772 --> 02:41:41.834]  We've only got like 30, 40 tickets left when I checked a few minutes ago.
[02:41:42.315 --> 02:41:43.495]  So it's going to be an overflow.
[02:41:43.555 --> 02:41:44.996]  Biggest 9-11 event the U.S.
[02:41:45.016 --> 02:41:45.697]  has ever seen.
[02:41:46.117 --> 02:41:47.558]  And it's going to be great having you there.
[02:41:47.578 --> 02:41:49.679]  You're going to be speaking on Sunday.
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:51.300]  Again, I can't wait to meet you.
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:53.462]  I know a lot of other folks can't wait to meet you.
[02:41:53.482 --> 02:41:54.963]  And we're going to see you there.
[02:41:55.003 --> 02:41:56.564]  Anything else you'd like to say in closing?
[02:41:57.316 --> 02:42:14.543]  Again, in closing, this is a unique opportunity that the audience have to see the last survivor of 9-11 to speak publicly in the United States, because I'm actually closing all my engagements in the United States, since I am so involved in doing outreach in other countries.
[02:42:14.863 --> 02:42:19.505]  So, this is a unique opportunity, and if they want to do it, it has to be on the Alex Jones.
[02:42:20.226 --> 02:42:20.966]  That's incredible.
[02:42:21.006 --> 02:42:22.947]  William, thank you for spending time with us today.
[02:42:22.967 --> 02:42:24.147]  Get some rest.
[02:42:24.487 --> 02:42:25.668]  When did you get in from Malaysia?
[02:42:26.903 --> 02:42:27.684]  I just got it last night.
[02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:27.924]  You got it.
[02:42:28.444 --> 02:42:28.844]  All the best.
[02:42:29.125 --> 02:42:29.225]  Yes.
[02:42:51.434 --> 02:42:56.315]  Jimmy just arrived to San Francisco, so I will make contact with him so he can call you today.
[02:42:56.335 --> 02:42:56.415]  Sure.
[02:42:56.675 --> 02:42:58.116]  And you can arrange anything for Friday.
[02:42:58.376 --> 02:42:58.876]  Thanks a lot.
[02:42:59.056 --> 02:42:59.676]  I'll see you, bro.
[02:43:00.056 --> 02:43:00.356]  All the best.
[02:43:00.416 --> 02:43:00.576]  Bye.
[02:43:00.616 --> 02:43:00.956]  Take care.
[02:43:00.976 --> 02:43:01.297]  Bye-bye.
[02:43:01.537 --> 02:43:02.537]  What a wild show.
[02:43:02.577 --> 02:43:09.019]  We have people on who've been grabbed by the Bilderbergs, by National Security in Canada, and interrogated in a secret facility.
[02:43:09.319 --> 02:43:10.479]  We have Greg Palast on.
[02:43:11.372 --> 02:43:13.514]  And then we shift gears with William Rodriguez.
[02:43:14.795 --> 02:43:17.697]  Paul, I'm going to go back to you in the final segment if you want a hold from Vancouver.
[02:43:17.717 --> 02:43:18.778]  I want to be fair to these callers.
[02:43:19.119 --> 02:43:23.082]  Let's go to Mike in Arizona first, then Joe in Wisconsin, John in North Carolina.
[02:43:23.382 --> 02:43:24.783]  Mike in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[02:43:24.823 --> 02:43:25.164]  Go ahead.
[02:43:25.684 --> 02:43:26.144]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:27.345 --> 02:43:32.830]  You know, I was planning not to go to this event in L.A.
[02:43:35.012 --> 02:43:36.353]  I just didn't get so many things going on.
[02:43:36.413 --> 02:43:38.695]  But listening to William Rodriguez,
[02:43:39.557 --> 02:43:40.757]  That guy really is a hero.
[02:43:42.278 --> 02:43:44.798]  He better buy tickets as soon as you get off the air!
[02:43:44.958 --> 02:43:46.019]  I know, I'm trying right now.
[02:43:47.799 --> 02:43:51.580]  I've just got to go to this thing just to meet him and possibly meet you.
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:44:07.624]  The interview you had earlier on with this fellow who got detained in Canada, there are a lot of ways to interpret that and I just wonder if that wasn't all about just intimidating the Alex Jones
[02:44:08.979 --> 02:44:20.069]  I have a feeling these people have the ability to tap into this guy's communications.
[02:44:20.129 --> 02:44:22.191]  They would have known if he posed any threat.
[02:44:22.732 --> 02:44:29.578]  So I think they wanted to happen exactly what did happen, which was his story to go to you
[02:44:30.208 --> 02:44:34.309]  And then to be broadcast out to all the listeners about Jones.
[02:44:34.449 --> 02:44:35.889]  Exactly, it's meant to intimidate us.
[02:44:35.909 --> 02:44:37.409]  But see, they're in an old paradigm.
[02:44:37.609 --> 02:44:38.350]  It isn't going to work.
[02:44:38.370 --> 02:44:39.810]  We're going to expose them as tyrants.
[02:44:40.350 --> 02:44:46.491]  Yeah, and you had a lady on last week, and you were a little bit rough with her, but I understand the point you're trying to make.
[02:44:47.131 --> 02:44:51.872]  She was trying to say, how do I communicate with my friends?
[02:44:52.272 --> 02:44:54.113]  They make me feel crazy.
[02:44:55.673 --> 02:44:56.013]  Women are
[02:44:56.789 --> 02:45:11.154]  Very social creatures, they like to do things in packs, and they like to see five other people doing the same thing around them, and it's harder for them, I think, even than for men to stand up and expose themselves to ridicule, even when they know they're dead right.
[02:45:12.555 --> 02:45:14.075]  But that's what we have to be willing to do.
[02:45:14.235 --> 02:45:20.858]  Like the old prophets in the Old Testament, you have to, in the face of people spitting on you,
[02:45:21.705 --> 02:45:24.246]  When you know you're right, you have to be willing to get in there.
[02:45:24.466 --> 02:45:25.626]  You see, that's the weird thing.
[02:45:25.946 --> 02:45:30.747]  It means nothing to me when idiots say horrible things about me and attack me and write hit pieces.
[02:45:30.767 --> 02:45:31.807]  They think they're hurting me.
[02:45:31.847 --> 02:45:32.608]  It only helps me.
[02:45:33.028 --> 02:45:33.488]  I don't know.
[02:45:33.508 --> 02:45:36.508]  I remember maybe ten years ago, getting griped at hurt me a little bit.
[02:45:36.588 --> 02:45:37.569]  Now, I kind of like it.
[02:45:38.169 --> 02:45:39.809]  I mean, is there something wrong with me or something?
[02:45:39.849 --> 02:45:40.489]  I just don't care.
[02:45:40.509 --> 02:45:41.289]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:41.309 --> 02:45:44.110]  You have to be a lot like Jesus was.
[02:45:44.170 --> 02:45:47.091]  I mean, He didn't beat people over the head with His message.
[02:45:47.331 --> 02:45:48.091]  He told them once.
[02:45:48.601 --> 02:45:53.703]  And he told his apostles, you know, if they won't listen to you, shake the dust off your sand and walk to the next town.
[02:45:53.723 --> 02:45:54.483]  Let the dead bury the dead.
[02:45:54.703 --> 02:45:54.943]  Right.
[02:45:55.683 --> 02:46:04.966]  So you plant your seeds and you come back six months or a year later and a lot of these people will wake up even though they were scoffing at you at the moment.
[02:46:04.986 --> 02:46:05.886]  Well, that's the big thing.
[02:46:05.906 --> 02:46:08.207]  A lot of people expect someone to wake up right then.
[02:46:08.227 --> 02:46:08.987]  No, no, no.
[02:46:09.268 --> 02:46:10.088]  It happens later.
[02:46:11.877 --> 02:46:14.597]  So anyway, I'll let you get on to your other callers.
[02:46:14.697 --> 02:46:15.498]  Sure, get your ticket.
[02:46:15.518 --> 02:46:16.258]  I want to meet you, Mike.
[02:46:16.458 --> 02:46:16.778]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:17.318 --> 02:46:18.378]  Mike's been calling in for years.
[02:46:18.438 --> 02:46:19.278]  He's a medical doctor.
[02:46:19.298 --> 02:46:20.979]  Alright, I like him.
[02:46:21.559 --> 02:46:23.199]  Let's talk to John in Wisconsin.
[02:46:23.219 --> 02:46:23.779]  You're on the air.
[02:46:23.859 --> 02:46:24.179]  Go ahead.
[02:46:24.199 --> 02:46:25.199]  Or Joe in Wisconsin.
[02:46:25.219 --> 02:46:25.559]  Excuse me.
[02:46:26.159 --> 02:46:26.599]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:26.900 --> 02:46:27.320]  Hi.
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:30.040]  Yeah, you know that feeling that you were saying that you get?
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:31.360]  That's picking up flack.
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:32.641]  You're definitely over the target.
[02:46:32.661 --> 02:46:34.681]  I've been getting my own flack.
[02:46:34.881 --> 02:46:38.321]  Police have been going a little bit overbounds.
[02:46:38.582 --> 02:46:41.142]  But anyway, there are two things that I wanted to
[02:46:42.616 --> 02:46:57.125]  I'm taking it personal in this whole thing, and I'm changing majors to a math communications, just so it can be more effective and to have tools necessary to explain to people things that are going on out there.
[02:46:58.426 --> 02:47:04.990]  I've already got my electronics associates, which is basically useless, so I don't feel really bad about that.
[02:47:05.407 --> 02:47:12.913]  But the other thing is I did launch that website, and what I wanted to devote it to is an alternative media outlet.
[02:47:13.814 --> 02:47:25.503]  And if you have an overflow story that you can't fit on your website, I would talk to your webmaster, and you would send me a clip, a file, or whatever, and I would post or something.
[02:47:25.763 --> 02:47:28.665]  So that's something that I would... You better have a lot of bandwidth.
[02:47:28.765 --> 02:47:29.766]  Okay, what's your website?
[02:47:29.786 --> 02:47:30.327]  You want to plug?
[02:47:30.347 --> 02:47:30.667]  Go ahead.
[02:47:31.372 --> 02:47:32.853]  No, it's one of those ugly URLs.
[02:47:33.133 --> 02:47:48.220]  But anyway, one of the things I was going to comment on was, do you remember back in the early 90s, late 80s, when they used to have media that would detail these kind of New World Order things?
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:49.621]  Like the rollerball.
[02:47:49.681 --> 02:47:51.241]  I know you're familiar with it.
[02:47:51.281 --> 02:47:56.504]  Yeah, they used movies to... Yeah, there's one in particular called Fortress, and it starred Christopher Lambert.
[02:47:56.684 --> 02:47:57.264]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[02:47:57.324 --> 02:47:58.064]  It's pretty good.
[02:47:58.204 --> 02:47:58.485]  Yeah.
[02:48:00.259 --> 02:48:08.341]  What I want to do is I want to collect up little bits of media and clips like that and just put it in a playlist for people to watch.
[02:48:08.921 --> 02:48:11.781]  And it'll be like an auto-feeding loader.
[02:48:12.381 --> 02:48:14.842]  And it'll stream directly off of YouTube.
[02:48:15.182 --> 02:48:16.782]  So the bandwidth will be incredible.
[02:48:18.282 --> 02:48:18.963]  That's exciting.
[02:48:19.003 --> 02:48:20.023]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:20.623 --> 02:48:25.264]  I'm going to come back and let Paul and John finish up.
[02:48:25.284 --> 02:48:27.064]  We just have time for two more calls.
[02:48:27.916 --> 02:48:31.280]  And if you want to support us, you believe in what we're doing, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:48:31.300 --> 02:48:32.741]  Visit the Secure Video and Bookstore.
[02:48:33.102 --> 02:48:35.564]  Look at all the different specials and deals and books and videos we offer.
[02:48:35.985 --> 02:48:36.846]  And get some today!
[02:48:37.326 --> 02:48:38.107]  And get them out to people.
[02:48:38.427 --> 02:48:38.968]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:39.008 --> 02:48:39.388]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.810 --> 02:48:54.192]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.453 --> 02:48:59.194]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.414 --> 02:49:05.056]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.316 --> 02:49:17.205]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.225 --> 02:49:21.729]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.929 --> 02:49:24.431]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.671 --> 02:49:31.376]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:49:45.777 --> 02:49:48.798]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:49.099 --> 02:49:54.021]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.281 --> 02:49:58.643]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.923 --> 02:50:07.847]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:08.047 --> 02:50:11.689]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.969 --> 02:50:16.994]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.294 --> 02:50:24.040]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:25.041]  What about you?

[02:50:47.142 --> 02:50:47.482]  I think so.

[02:51:47.010 --> 02:51:51.352]  I'm not trying to be mean to Paul in Vancouver.
[02:51:51.372 --> 02:51:53.633]  I held him over so we'd have time to talk.
[02:51:55.754 --> 02:51:59.376]  But I run into people sometimes who just go, well, couldn't this be a good political policy?
[02:51:59.436 --> 02:52:01.698]  Wouldn't it help this, this, and that?
[02:52:01.818 --> 02:52:06.020]  And it does the exact opposite of what he's saying it would do.
[02:52:07.261 --> 02:52:08.121]  By their own admissions.
[02:52:08.161 --> 02:52:09.882]  I mean, I've actually researched this.
[02:52:09.942 --> 02:52:11.203]  I've seen their policy reports.
[02:52:11.243 --> 02:52:11.483]  I know
[02:52:12.348 --> 02:52:13.849]  What globalization does.
[02:52:13.989 --> 02:52:15.330]  It's not good for the average person.
[02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:17.070]  It's not good for country sovereignty.
[02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:20.792]  The last thing we want is a North American Union that leads to an American Union.
[02:52:21.953 --> 02:52:23.474]  Or the Pan-American Union.
[02:52:24.134 --> 02:52:27.996]  And the people are just now learning of its existence when it's already 70% complete.
[02:52:29.036 --> 02:52:29.977]  But finish up, Paul.
[02:52:30.017 --> 02:52:31.618]  I mean, I'm just confused by your call.
[02:52:32.838 --> 02:52:40.602]  Well, I mean, the way I see it is, every store I go to, every, you know, I look on the back of the box and it says, Made in China.
[02:52:41.198 --> 02:52:43.000]  Okay, this is the issue here.
[02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:45.102]  Why are we pumping so much money?
[02:52:45.322 --> 02:52:49.966]  Why not put the money into our own area?
[02:52:50.527 --> 02:52:52.849]  What does an American union have to do with that?
[02:52:54.551 --> 02:52:57.794]  Economically, we would merge our economies together.
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:01.382]  You'd still buy the stuff from China.
[02:53:01.582 --> 02:53:03.563]  You'd just add a whole new layer of bureaucracy, sir.
[02:53:03.583 --> 02:53:06.726]  It has nothing to do with getting, you know, products made here.
[02:53:07.106 --> 02:53:09.648]  You do that by demanding American or Canadian made.
[02:53:09.688 --> 02:53:12.890]  You do that by not buying the DVD player that's $10 cheaper.
[02:53:13.310 --> 02:53:15.432]  You do that by exposing the trade deficit.
[02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:20.016]  Well, the way I see it is the governments are falling apart here.
[02:53:20.516 --> 02:53:21.997]  There's so much decay inside.
[02:53:22.177 --> 02:53:23.458]  Well, that's by design, sir.
[02:53:23.478 --> 02:53:27.041]  The very people that want world government are the ones that have hijacked our governments.
[02:53:28.343 --> 02:53:31.526]  And basically... You understand the bad guys run global government?
[02:53:31.987 --> 02:53:32.768]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:32.788 --> 02:53:33.468]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:53:33.488 --> 02:53:34.509]  We can talk more about it, sir.
[02:53:35.931 --> 02:53:37.733]  Let's talk to John in North Carolina.
[02:53:37.773 --> 02:53:38.253]  Last caller.
[02:53:38.293 --> 02:53:38.894]  Go ahead, John.
[02:53:39.354 --> 02:53:39.715]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:39.735 --> 02:53:40.616]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:53:40.656 --> 02:53:42.097]  I'm going to go ahead and apologize early.
[02:53:42.137 --> 02:53:44.539]  I'm on an IP phone, so if it drops out... That's okay.
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:44.900]  Go ahead.
[02:53:45.433 --> 02:53:51.117]  I wanted to ask you something about a subject nobody talks about anymore, and that's the Anthrax mailings of 2001.
[02:53:52.418 --> 02:53:52.698]  U.S.
[02:53:52.739 --> 02:53:54.460]  government sent those, it's part of the record.
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:56.942]  Oh yes, I'm quite aware of who sent those.
[02:53:57.002 --> 02:53:58.683]  They were on Cipro weeks before it even showed up.
[02:53:58.723 --> 02:54:00.064]  The White House, U.S.
[02:54:00.084 --> 02:54:04.707]  government strain from Fort Detrick, Maryland, coded in BENT-9, and it just goes on and on.
[02:54:05.288 --> 02:54:06.148]  I thoroughly believe you.
[02:54:06.529 --> 02:54:07.209]  My question was,
[02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:18.268]  This case with Stephen Hatfield and his volunteer former federal prosecutor, Thomas Connolly, helping him out, is this just the government's way of paying him for the job well done?
[02:54:18.488 --> 02:54:22.471]  No, they go after an innocent person knowing that it'll be a dead-end trail.
[02:54:22.531 --> 02:54:25.574]  It's like Janice Karpinski, the general over all the camps.
[02:54:25.954 --> 02:54:29.076]  She wasn't allowed into the wings that were CIA contractor run.
[02:54:29.417 --> 02:54:30.858]  Then they tried to burn her with it.
[02:54:30.898 --> 02:54:33.420]  The media does an investigation, finds out she's innocent.
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:35.281]  They just put us off on a trail.
[02:54:37.443 --> 02:54:38.464]  I know he's not innocent.
[02:54:39.656 --> 02:54:40.297]  How do you know that?
[02:54:40.877 --> 02:54:41.698]  I was one of the victims.
[02:54:42.778 --> 02:54:45.821]  I can tell you what Ottilie Lundgren and Kathy Nguyen have in common.
[02:54:46.521 --> 02:54:50.064]  I also have it in common with them, and Stephen Hatfield was stalking me afterwards.
[02:54:50.965 --> 02:54:51.485]  You're kidding?
[02:54:51.926 --> 02:54:52.226]  No, sir.
[02:54:53.887 --> 02:54:54.728]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:54:54.768 --> 02:54:58.591]  Send me some information on that, and if you've got documentation, I'd like to have you as a guest, okay?
[02:54:59.091 --> 02:54:59.351]  Okay.
[02:54:59.491 --> 02:55:01.413]  Do you have an email address I can send it to?
[02:55:02.314 --> 02:55:05.456]  Yeah, we'll put you on hold and give you an email address that isn't as heavily trafficked, okay?
[02:55:06.357 --> 02:55:07.137]  Thank you for the call.
[02:55:09.665 --> 02:55:21.030]  We know the name of an Israeli operative that worked at the lab, who had signed into those areas where he wasn't supposed to be, where the anthrax was, and all the evidence we have points away from Hatfield.
[02:55:22.071 --> 02:55:29.134]  Okay, so I don't know why Hatfield would, who they claim was making it in a bucket.
[02:55:30.475 --> 02:55:32.156]  It took a huge factory to make this stuff.
[02:55:32.176 --> 02:55:32.896]  That's part of the record.
[02:55:33.737 --> 02:55:34.677]  Whole nother issue.
[02:55:35.878 --> 02:55:36.498]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:37.426 --> 02:55:38.767]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:38.807 --> 02:55:41.047]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:55:41.067 --> 02:55:42.468]  Another great broadcast.
[02:55:42.488 --> 02:55:43.328]  Thanks to my crew here.
[02:55:43.368 --> 02:55:44.509]  Thanks to Greg Pallis for coming in.
[02:55:44.829 --> 02:55:45.829]  Thanks to William Rodriguez.
[02:55:46.189 --> 02:55:48.910]  Thanks to Dan McCormick for having the courage to come on the broadcast.
[02:55:49.330 --> 02:55:50.211]  Talk about what happened to him.
[02:55:50.251 --> 02:55:52.431]  If you missed that, listen to the first hour tonight.
[02:55:52.471 --> 02:55:54.532]  It was an incredible interview in the first hour.
[02:55:55.512 --> 02:56:02.675]  And remember, you've got about 20-30 minutes, and I'm pulling it, to get tickets at infowarriors.com to the 9-11 Conference.
[02:56:03.527 --> 02:56:03.868]  Okay.
[02:56:04.008 --> 02:56:05.249]  The tickets are almost gone right now.
[02:56:05.389 --> 02:56:06.531]  In fact, they could be gone right now.
[02:56:06.591 --> 02:56:06.951]  I don't know.
[02:56:06.971 --> 02:56:08.233]  I haven't looked it up in about 30 minutes.
[02:56:09.094 --> 02:56:12.438]  If you want to get Martial Law, Order of Death, my films, they're excellent.
[02:56:12.478 --> 02:56:13.279]  You need to have them.
