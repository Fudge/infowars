[00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.173]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:07.874]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:09.714]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:11.175]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:12.815]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:17.157]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:21.799]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.000]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:27.541]  It is Friday.
[00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:34.180]  Already the 17th day of November, 2006, Year of Our Lord.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.026]  I just got knocked off my horse again, as Saul of Tarsus was knocked off his horse.
[00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:51.671]  I did two radio interviews this morning, and I was just doing one on 1520 AM in Westchester, PA.
[00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:58.475]  And, I don't want to say I was articulate, but it was just flowing, the information,
[00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:05.951]  And it was so clear, and I was just breaking down the master plan, and I wasn't perseverating on one issue or the other.
[00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:21.299]  I was just laying it out in a very simple way, and I was just realizing to myself, it was hitting me anew, hitting me in a fresh way, just how much trouble we're in, and just how horrible our enemies are.
[00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:24.112]  I mean, a religion of death!
[00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:36.019]  A worldwide elite working towards, inexorably, towards a completely dark, that's not even a word that describes it properly, world!
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.461]  Just a horrible system!
[00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:44.764]  Basically, they create evil, they create bad things, and then they feed on it like carrion buzzards!
[00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:51.148]  We're dealing with an aberrant subspecies of Homo sapiens sapiens,
[00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.852]  Who just revels in death and destruction.
[00:01:54.952 --> 00:01:56.553]  I've got tons of news today.
[00:01:57.373 --> 00:01:59.855]  It's all of the utmost importance and we'll be covering it.
[00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:15.804]  We have Dr. Michael Kaufman joining us, who's for Congress put together with existing government documents, the UN maps of where you'll be able to travel, all the roads being toll roads, most areas being shut down to human activity.
[00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:20.047]  And by the way, the big national toll road maps, if you fit them over Dr. Kaufman's maps,
[00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:22.855]  It's identical.
[00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:28.956]  These are going to be used as the prison sections, the quote, corridors, as they're called, where we'll be able to travel.
[00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:40.519]  I'm already hearing radio and TV ads all over Austin about the new Central Texas Corridor and how we connect to the Dallas DFW Corridor and the San Antonio South Texas Corridor.
[00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.799]  It's hellish.
[00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.760]  I mean, the grid is going in.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.481]  And I was getting chills.
[00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:49.221]  I mean, it was hitting me.
[00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:50.121]  I was getting chills.
[00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:52.332]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:57.414]  I mean, we are... Now it's kind of the opposite.
[00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:59.415]  I'm speechless.
[00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:04.616]  The information was just flowing out of me, making all the connections, actually articulating the picture, actually.
[00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:07.497]  I'm going to attempt to do it after the break.
[00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:10.978]  I'm going to attempt to go over the master plan.
[00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:12.359]  I always talk about how I'm going to do this.
[00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.400]  I just did this in the last 45 minutes.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.060]  I was on for 45 minutes.
[00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:21.694]  Actually, 48 and a half minutes if you want to be technical, the exact, on that show.
[00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:24.716]  And I just laid it out.
[00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:26.857]  I've got to get a recording of that.
[00:03:26.897 --> 00:03:30.498]  I wonder if they recorded it, and I need to.
[00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.079]  Because it was good.
[00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.900]  I know it was.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.260]  I really laid it out.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.921]  I felt good.
[00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:43.285]  I'm normally real frustrated because it's hard to articulate the grand proportions of
[00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:51.200]  This thing that has invaded our planet.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.464]  This thing that's creeping over everything and taking everything over and replicating itself.
[00:03:57.984 --> 00:03:59.805]  And I see us replicating against it.
[00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.806]  It's a grand battle.
[00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.807]  I have to tell you.
[00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:09.070]  It's wonderful that so many people are fighting it.
[00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.291]  But at the same time, it's bittersweet.
[00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:13.532]  It's horrible and it's very sweet.
[00:04:14.793 --> 00:04:16.214]  I felt so blessed.
[00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:20.155]  I was thinking about, my gosh, I am fighting this thing toe-to-toe with your help.
[00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:22.116]  I am on the front lines.
[00:04:23.057 --> 00:04:26.360]  And I start realizing it's very humbling.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.446]  I guess for a worldly person it would be a grandeur type power trip, but really it's very humbling.
[00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:37.769]  It's exhilarating, also nauseating at the same time.
[00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.254]  It's just the sensation is very hard to describe.
[00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:51.498]  I think it's kind of like the feeling a kamikaze would have as they were approaching an aircraft carrier.
[00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:54.707]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.747 --> 00:04:55.289]  Stay with me.
[00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:04.755]  It's here!
[00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:09.757]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:17.801]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:25.504]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:32.747]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.322]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:41.143]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:43.524]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:47.785]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.900]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:09.123]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.383 --> 00:06:13.745]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:14.045 --> 00:06:22.949]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.791]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:32.093]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.393 --> 00:06:39.136]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:40.157]  What about you?
[00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:46.272]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:06.805]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:08.806]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:15.350]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.774]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:23.695]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:24.135]  I think so.
[00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:50.568]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:38.015]  Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of forty-five But I am still alive I was a sailor
[00:08:39.509 --> 00:09:07.622]  I was born upon the tide With the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico I went aloft and furled a nasal in a blow And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I'm living still
[00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:33.402]  I was a dam builder Across the river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
[00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:41.366]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:47.309]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[00:09:48.909 --> 00:09:53.611]  We have a lot of really important news to get to, and I'm going to be covering it.
[00:09:55.592 --> 00:10:02.055]  But before we do that, I think it's important to talk about the Globalist Master Plan.
[00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:11.347]  And then walk through just a few examples of how they're bringing it all together and their mindset, what makes them tick.
[00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:27.212]  Throughout history, throughout human interaction,
[00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:38.823]  People who are willing to be abusive and who are willing to dominate and who are willing to be ruthless tends to getting into positions of power over the truth.
[00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:45.545]  That's just the facts of life.
[00:10:48.406 --> 00:10:49.546]  That's the way it works.
[00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:57.568]  And then you get into a competition of the ruthless, of the cunning.
[00:10:59.665 --> 00:11:13.492]  And then you get societies of the ruthless and the cunning, and they develop it to a state-of-the-art art form, and they become entrenched, and then they become inbred and insane, and then they become more and more decadent.
[00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:19.240]  And for people that can't believe this, look at history.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.442]  Look at the barbarism.
[00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:28.230]  The Aztecs on certain holidays would sacrifice 10,000 people.
[00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.353]  That's what Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is about.
[00:11:31.393 --> 00:11:32.655]  Just insane
[00:11:34.641 --> 00:12:00.438]  uh... blood-drinking feast people happily so brainwashed by cultural brainwashing giving their small children up so that the high priest could cut their baby's hearts out mass hallucinations mass drugging the priest class denouncing everyone running around mad power trips the Romans in their decline the Babylonians
[00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:18.346]  Even in the more genteel forms of it, the Japanese, who would exercise power, and there are real accounts of where a Japanese samurai would get a new sword, and he'd want to test it, and he'd go out into the rice paddies and find somebody that didn't bow down properly, and he'd just cut their head off.
[00:12:18.826 --> 00:12:28.133]  And it was about the exercise of power, the cult of power, as O'Brien, torturing Winston in 1984, says, it's about pressing on the nerve of power.
[00:12:30.103 --> 00:12:31.284]  And they one-up each other.
[00:12:31.344 --> 00:12:33.026]  It's a reign of terror.
[00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:46.537]  When they, and this is on record, during the Red Terror in 1919, when it was really heating up, one of the commissariats said to
[00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:50.499]  Vladimir Lenin, he said, to who do we kill?
[00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:51.220]  Who do we arrest?
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.320]  And he said, randomly!
[00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:53.881]  Just go out!
[00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:55.302]  I ought to find the exact quote.
[00:12:55.362 --> 00:12:59.765]  He said it a lot more powerfully than I can, being demon-possessed.
[00:13:00.325 --> 00:13:04.307]  He said, you know, the nature of it is that it is random.
[00:13:04.607 --> 00:13:05.608]  It seeks blood.
[00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:06.628]  The red!
[00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:09.270]  The red banner of the Red Terror!
[00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:11.931]  It was really cryptic.
[00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:12.892]  I ought to find that quote.
[00:13:13.968 --> 00:13:21.859]  It's just meant to be just eating its own police, running over its own servants, running over the innocent.
[00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:27.968]  Just bowling around, smashing like an out-of-control juggernaut on huge blood-drenched treads.
[00:13:29.835 --> 00:13:30.955]  That's the nature!
[00:13:31.155 --> 00:13:32.656]  Don't you understand that?
[00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.576]  And free societies build these limited walls.
[00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:48.339]  And if you run around servicing the walls and watching at the parapets and oiling the gates and, you know, everything, being ready and sharpening your spear and your arrows and your sword, you might just maybe have some freedom!
[00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:49.119]  Maybe!
[00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:51.100]  If you fight with everything you've got!
[00:13:52.802 --> 00:14:01.225]  You think you can just stumble around having riots over PlayStation 3s and putting your makeup on for hours and strutting around with your beer gut at the baseball game?
[00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:08.688]  You think you're going to be free when you don't know anything about our country, anything about the Bill of Rights, anything about the war machine, anything about how the government works?
[00:14:09.068 --> 00:14:11.008]  You think you're going to be free?
[00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:12.029]  And let me tell you something.
[00:14:12.049 --> 00:14:12.909]  You're not going to be free.
[00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:14.089]  You're going to be a slave.
[00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:18.311]  And let me tell you a little bit about the people that are now running things.
[00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.312]  They make Adolf Alois Hitler
[00:14:22.032 --> 00:14:24.072]  look like a patron saint.
[00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:29.953]  They make Stalin look like a weakling.
[00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:40.395]  They make Mao look like a first grader compared to Nobel Prize winners and quantum mechanics.
[00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:48.197]  The people running things now are the ultimate synthesis of evil.
[00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:50.477]  The ultimate
[00:14:52.148 --> 00:15:03.257]  And you are now seeing the final stages of completion of what turns this planet into a Death Star.
[00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.780]  And a Death Star that fires on itself.
[00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:10.082]  A prison planet.
[00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:14.726]  A rendering factory to kill you and your family.
[00:15:20.872 --> 00:15:23.714]  I saw it online, and I wish I could find it.
[00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:27.357]  Is it, uh, cartoons of war?
[00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:33.601]  And I asked, I meant to buy it, and I never did.
[00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.361]  I've seen it online.
[00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:46.069]  It's the, it's the Disney from during World War II, where they're going, Oompa Loompa, and they're dancing around a bar, and it's Hitler, and he's saying, My New World Order!
[00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.651]  Don't we have that clip in the computer, John?
[00:15:50.788 --> 00:15:52.489]  We haven't played that in years.
[00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:59.955]  And I was on this talk show this morning, and I mentioned it, and they'd seen it.
[00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:01.736]  I know you're out there listening.
[00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.238]  Can you send me a video clip of it, listeners?
[00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:03.818]  Can you email it?
[00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:04.819]  Can you post it on my MySpace?
[00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:05.359]  Can you find it?
[00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:07.121]  Can you find out the video it's in?
[00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:07.921]  I know you're listening.
[00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.022]  Because I want to play that.
[00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:13.265]  Because, again, I'm talking about the master plan, and I'm digressing off into cartoons.
[00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.969]  But I talked about, you know, Hitler called for a new world order.
[00:16:18.493 --> 00:16:20.655]  In Mein Kampf, he talks about his struggle.
[00:16:21.236 --> 00:16:21.877]  Mein Struggle.
[00:16:22.878 --> 00:16:24.639]  He talks about a new world order.
[00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:34.129]  Stalin, Lenin, Bush Senior, Tony Blair, John Major, they all talk about a new world order.
[00:16:36.867 --> 00:16:41.170]  And Hitler, Stalin, Mao, they were all put into power.
[00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:55.620]  Mao, we knew this decades ago, it was admitted, we have the documents, but to see it on History Channel, as I've spoken many times, to see the old CIA section chief, 90-something years old, popular belief, we liked Mao and thought he'd be a stabilizing force and we put him in.
[00:16:55.941 --> 00:17:04.447]  Now we already knew that because David Rockefeller had written editorials in the New York Times in 1976 when Mao died, about how great the Cultural Revolution was.
[00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.328]  By the way, that killed 60 million people.
[00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.285]  Chinese government admits that.
[00:17:09.606 --> 00:17:21.189]  I mean, can you imagine David Rockefeller writing editorials in the New York Times praising someone who killed 60 million of his own people?
[00:17:21.209 --> 00:17:34.493]  I mean, it's hard to get your mind around that, but in this Iraq war, our government in the last 16 years has killed, last 15 years, 15 and a half years, has killed 2.15 million official numbers
[00:17:37.372 --> 00:17:43.060]  Last three and a half, six... A hundred and fifty-four thousand.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.183]  I mean, you start talking about these numbers, you see millions of people dying.
[00:17:48.563 --> 00:17:50.764]  But here in America, we didn't know, you see.
[00:17:51.045 --> 00:18:11.299]  We were here, you know, while all this was going on in other parts of the world, driving around in 57 Chevys, and drinking beer, and going to the drive-in, and everybody's fun, and running our businesses, and having our lives, and loving, and living, and learning, and just everything was great, while the very people that funded all of this out of our government were quietly building.
[00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:12.740]  Look at them with their guns.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.220]  Look at them with their wealth.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.021]  Just build it.
[00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.801]  Just infiltrate the organizations.
[00:18:17.142 --> 00:18:17.902]  Just take over.
[00:18:17.982 --> 00:18:19.663]  Just slowly twist the police.
[00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:21.924]  Slowly bend them to our will.
[00:18:22.344 --> 00:18:23.805]  Slowly build the camps.
[00:18:24.345 --> 00:18:25.866]  Slowly get rid of the borders.
[00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:27.907]  Slowly bring in the illegals.
[00:18:28.287 --> 00:18:29.847]  Slowly break down the country.
[00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:31.988]  And that, it's right there, waiting.
[00:18:32.048 --> 00:18:33.729]  Now, through paper-thin veil.
[00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:35.710]  Just ready to come in.
[00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.672]  It can't wait to actually bite into you.
[00:18:41.517 --> 00:18:42.458]  It's right there.
[00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:44.418]  It's right there.
[00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:46.519]  And it's a real monster.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.142]  And it's very close to being unleashed.
[00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:55.624]  It's already... Already it's... Forerunners have been released.
[00:18:55.724 --> 00:18:56.844]  Already it's scouts.
[00:18:57.504 --> 00:18:58.665]  You think things are bad now?
[00:18:58.725 --> 00:19:00.706]  We're only meeting the enemy scouts.
[00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:06.349]  You think I'm grabbing little kids in New York and giving them pesticides until they die in test?
[00:19:07.836 --> 00:19:10.477]  And you think I'm killing all these babies and all this other stuff.
[00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:11.677]  That's just their scouts.
[00:19:13.518 --> 00:19:15.278]  That's their probes.
[00:19:16.578 --> 00:19:22.760]  You know, these huge things we encounter, these huge bureaucracies of wickedness that seem so immense.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.181]  Those are just vanguard.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:29.162]  Look out ahead of you.
[00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:29.902]  You can see it.
[00:19:31.482 --> 00:19:33.323]  Look at the size of it coming at us.
[00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:42.685]  When we get back, I'm going to break down what they're going to do, how they're going to do it, what you are going to witness.
[00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:53.214]  And in this transmission, and in you repeating it, and in you adding to it, and doing your own research, during the darkest battle, we will win.
[00:19:53.855 --> 00:19:55.556]  Because we are foretelling.
[00:19:56.764 --> 00:19:57.885]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:19:57.925 --> 00:19:58.765]  Today is November 17, 2006.
[00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:02.747]  Gold opened at $614.40 an ounce and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $634.84 and $319.97 for half ounce coins.
[00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:02.987]  That's $634.84 and $319.97.
[00:20:03.027 --> 00:20:06.748]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank
[00:20:22.615 --> 00:20:25.818]  of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.201]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:32.703]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:20:32.783 --> 00:20:35.766]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:38.908]  Mias has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:39.269]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:40.470]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.710]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.171]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage
[00:20:51.598 --> 00:21:00.023]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:00.663 --> 00:21:09.909]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:17.593]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.990]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.271]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[00:22:05.662 --> 00:22:06.282]  Yeah.
[00:22:06.662 --> 00:22:08.063]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:11.825]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:13.786]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:22:14.246 --> 00:22:15.947]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:22:16.327 --> 00:22:18.108]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:19.149]  Honey, cheer up.
[00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:21.837]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:22:22.097 --> 00:22:22.417]  What?
[00:22:22.858 --> 00:22:33.329]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.455]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:39.976]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:22:59.986 --> 00:23:01.927]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:02.428 --> 00:23:04.809]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:05.638 --> 00:23:14.062]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:15.022 --> 00:23:19.924]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[00:24:10.961 --> 00:24:35.874]  All of times have come Fear, but now they're gone Seasons don't feel the rebirth Nor do the wind, the sun, and the rain Come on, baby Baby, take my hand
[00:24:37.168 --> 00:24:38.649]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:40.990]  I'm glad that you've joined us today.
[00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.571]  We'll get into all the news, take your calls.
[00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:45.273]  We've got a very important guest, Dr. Michael Kaufman, joining us.
[00:24:45.913 --> 00:24:50.395]  We'll talk about the Total Control Grid, a new film he's made, a new video.
[00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:53.857]  But before I do that, let me continue with the master plan.
[00:24:56.198 --> 00:25:02.382]  So, the very same elite, and we can directly trace them to all these events, and they publicly admit
[00:25:04.656 --> 00:25:07.698]  That they're involved and brag about all this later.
[00:25:08.439 --> 00:25:12.402]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, all of it.
[00:25:13.643 --> 00:25:18.527]  What's 20 million, 50 million, and 60 million?
[00:25:18.587 --> 00:25:21.910]  That's 130 million people.
[00:25:23.671 --> 00:25:27.034]  That Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, conservatively.
[00:25:27.054 --> 00:25:31.998]  Another 2 million, conservatively, in Cambodia.
[00:25:34.973 --> 00:25:38.274]  200,000 or so in Cuba.
[00:25:38.534 --> 00:25:39.314]  Pinochet.
[00:25:41.255 --> 00:25:42.115]  Tens of thousands.
[00:25:45.616 --> 00:25:46.517]  It goes on and on.
[00:25:46.617 --> 00:25:48.237]  And it doesn't matter who it is.
[00:25:48.317 --> 00:25:50.538]  Pinochet, Fidel.
[00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:53.179]  They're always put in by the globalists.
[00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:54.199]  It's admitted by them.
[00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.039]  Most Americans don't know that.
[00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:58.740]  Our government helped put Fidel in and then, quote, he turned against them.
[00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:02.401]  It's always the same story.
[00:26:02.821 --> 00:26:04.342]  It's always the same M.O.
[00:26:05.422 --> 00:26:08.465]  And it's a form of governance.
[00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:10.567]  It's divide and conquer.
[00:26:10.607 --> 00:26:15.251]  They break it into subsections, warring with each other, but then controlling those subsections.
[00:26:15.571 --> 00:26:18.153]  But now they're moving out of that to the global government.
[00:26:19.595 --> 00:26:23.238]  With the American Union, the European Union, the Asian Union is the big three.
[00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:31.900]  They've set up all of these officially, though the general public, even in Asia, doesn't know that they've announced the Asian Union, and they're operating under it.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.461]  The American Union's here, the average American still doesn't even know.
[00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:36.341]  That's publicly operating.
[00:26:38.101 --> 00:26:39.201]  All of this is happening.
[00:26:40.322 --> 00:26:50.203]  And after they get it in place, they're going to have controlled bioweapons releases, released by Western governments, and then each event will get bigger.
[00:26:50.243 --> 00:26:53.304]  The first one will be small, then it'll get bigger,
[00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:54.815]  Thousands dead.
[00:26:55.397 --> 00:26:56.500]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[00:26:56.901 --> 00:26:57.623]  Millions dead.
[00:26:58.024 --> 00:26:59.007]  Tens of millions dead.
[00:26:59.488 --> 00:27:00.490]  Hundreds of millions dead.
[00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:03.032]  They're preparing you for this.
[00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:04.953]  Oh, bird flu will kill 2 million.
[00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:07.334]  Oh, SARS will kill 500 million.
[00:27:07.614 --> 00:27:08.875]  Every day there's a new article.
[00:27:09.095 --> 00:27:13.957]  And then they go out and have emergency federal drills, which trains the locals to go under federal control.
[00:27:14.398 --> 00:27:15.898]  All of that is a dress rehearsal.
[00:27:16.058 --> 00:27:18.640]  Because when they really do it, they don't want a bunch of panic.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.723]  They want you to orderly do what they say and learn to love authority and learn to be micromanaged.
[00:27:26.264 --> 00:27:30.386]  To where if you're necking on a plane, you get 20 years in prison as a terrorist.
[00:27:31.241 --> 00:27:33.783]  Or, now the news had edited the video.
[00:27:33.803 --> 00:27:36.465]  The video we had was the local NBC News of that guy getting tasered.
[00:27:37.446 --> 00:27:38.847]  We now have the actual video.
[00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.628]  He was agreeing to walk out with him.
[00:27:40.668 --> 00:27:41.388]  He was a student.
[00:27:41.709 --> 00:27:42.890]  And they just started tasering him.
[00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.511]  And it wasn't six times.
[00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:45.632]  It's more than that.
[00:27:45.672 --> 00:27:46.532]  It looks like ten.
[00:27:48.293 --> 00:27:53.577]  And then when he can't get up, because they just tasered him, in one case fifteen seconds before, they taser him again.
[00:27:53.697 --> 00:27:56.980]  Knowing that a big strong cop can't get up for usually about a minute.
[00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:00.042]  If they really get hit with a taser.
[00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:08.981]  So, by the way, major cities are banning smoking citywide and they're banning smoking in your own home.
[00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:11.061]  Now again, it sounds reasonable.
[00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:11.822]  Cigarettes are bad.
[00:28:11.842 --> 00:28:12.942]  We should be able to do it, but it isn't.
[00:28:13.282 --> 00:28:15.043]  You see, it's control freak.
[00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.144]  It'll give them something to tattletale on.
[00:28:17.784 --> 00:28:23.486]  They fired a police captain because he was seen smoking a cigar in Florida because smoking is banned there.
[00:28:24.727 --> 00:28:25.747]  It's going to affect you too.
[00:28:26.147 --> 00:28:29.488]  All these new rules, all these new things that make normal behavior illegal.
[00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:30.589]  Then it's fast food.
[00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:31.609]  I told you that for years.
[00:28:31.849 --> 00:28:34.370]  Now New York, Chicago are about to ban most forms of it.
[00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.030]  Oh, well that sounds reasonable too.
[00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.691]  Then it's banned spanking.
[00:28:37.931 --> 00:28:40.031]  Then your child acts like a complete heathen.
[00:28:40.532 --> 00:28:41.472]  The neighbor sees it.
[00:28:41.672 --> 00:28:43.032]  You just give them a little spat.
[00:28:43.632 --> 00:28:44.873]  Boom, they take your children.
[00:28:46.513 --> 00:28:49.194]  Doesn't matter they're five times more likely to abuse them or kill them.
[00:28:49.614 --> 00:28:50.454]  That's official numbers.
[00:28:50.494 --> 00:28:51.155]  It doesn't matter.
[00:28:51.635 --> 00:28:52.295]  They're the government.
[00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:53.976]  And they're privatizing it.
[00:28:54.356 --> 00:28:57.418]  The government's being handed over to private interest, which are these global criminals.
[00:28:59.239 --> 00:29:01.841]  They're just being given it, okay?
[00:29:02.481 --> 00:29:04.963]  So this is the system.
[00:29:05.363 --> 00:29:20.793]  And so there'll be more and more terror attacks, more and more bio-attacks, and after each time, we'll get herded into more and more compact cities, herded into the corridors, social workers visiting you on a weekly basis, one-child policies, as Dr. Pianka said at UT, to 95% standing ovation.
[00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:23.876]  The 4000's.
[00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:28.518]  As he said, we need a police state to carry out the killing.
[00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:29.659]  See?
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.802]  And after it's in place... And again, I know a lot of you aren't going to believe me.
[00:29:35.263 --> 00:29:40.146]  When they're killing us en masse, this is a seed I'm planting.
[00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.988]  If it goes this far down the line, then you'll hear this.
[00:29:44.528 --> 00:29:45.189]  Then you'll know.
[00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.191]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.651 --> 00:29:50.152]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:33:50.934 --> 00:33:53.935]  Let me just continue with the Globalist Master Plan.
[00:33:56.065 --> 00:33:59.551]  So that you can go research the claims I'm making and find out this is really the plan.
[00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:02.295]  You see, eugenics started in England.
[00:34:03.618 --> 00:34:09.908]  And it grew out of a variant of the theory of evolution, social Darwinism.
[00:34:10.766 --> 00:34:14.949]  That the robber barons were very popular with.
[00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.330]  They liked to popularize it.
[00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.091]  They said, hey, we're brutal.
[00:34:18.151 --> 00:34:19.312]  We do a lot of bad things.
[00:34:19.852 --> 00:34:23.014]  We use the population basically like cattle.
[00:34:24.075 --> 00:34:29.739]  But it doesn't matter because it's our right to be ruling because we're the best because we're in the positions of power.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.662]  No, it meant that you craved unwarranted power.
[00:34:33.742 --> 00:34:39.786]  It meant that you were willing to do... Crime really does pay, by the way, folks, if you do it within the system, within the syndicate.
[00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:47.692]  At least it pays in this life to a certain extent if monetary and control and strutting and pop is what you're into.
[00:34:48.552 --> 00:34:52.915]  And so they use that to rationalize everything they were doing.
[00:34:53.895 --> 00:35:04.641]  And of course, previous to that, hundreds of years before that, the big granddaddy of modern eugenics was Lord Malthus.
[00:35:04.701 --> 00:35:06.282]  You've heard the term Malthusian.
[00:35:07.108 --> 00:35:08.390]  Saying there's too many people.
[00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:13.557]  In fact, the Queen, you know, had commissions write big reports about, uh, there's too many Irish.
[00:35:13.638 --> 00:35:16.001]  How do we, how do we cull them?
[00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:17.984]  How do we reduce their numbers?
[00:35:18.445 --> 00:35:19.586]  There's too many poor.
[00:35:19.626 --> 00:35:22.130]  Well, the answer was let them starve to death.
[00:35:23.537 --> 00:35:36.062]  Because the elites were big into breeding horses, rabbits, cows, dogs, and they had big books published about human breeding and how the breed was falling apart.
[00:35:36.122 --> 00:35:40.924]  It's kind of the idiocracy view that Mike Judge put out, but he put it out from another perspective.
[00:35:42.463 --> 00:35:44.304]  But it really does have an overall eugenics message.
[00:35:44.384 --> 00:35:53.629]  In fact, the film starts with, you know, showing idiots breeding with idiots, producing super idiots, and how the intelligent are not mating at high levels.
[00:35:53.649 --> 00:35:58.591]  You know, people who do have hierarchies tend to not breed or breed as prodigiously.
[00:35:58.611 --> 00:36:02.653]  And so, you know, there is a grain to it.
[00:36:03.647 --> 00:36:08.649]  Okay, so they take that, and they say, we've got to start exterminating people.
[00:36:08.789 --> 00:36:13.010]  And Hitler gave awards to Margaret Singer, received awards from Margaret Singer.
[00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.951]  I had read that, and I knew that.
[00:36:14.991 --> 00:36:18.212]  I'd learned that even before I got on the radio 12 years ago, and TV.
[00:36:19.692 --> 00:36:24.134]  But then, I remember about 8 years ago or so, I was watching PBS one night.
[00:36:24.154 --> 00:36:25.855]  It was a local Austin PBS.
[00:36:25.895 --> 00:36:30.536]  And it was like a two-hour documentary with the letters from Margaret Singer to Hitler.
[00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:31.677]  I wish I knew the name.
[00:36:31.717 --> 00:36:32.237]  I forgot the name.
[00:36:32.257 --> 00:36:32.957]  Do you know the name out there?
[00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:34.370]  I bet somebody does.
[00:36:34.751 --> 00:36:39.833]  Letters back, and she gave him awards, and he gave her awards, and he sided in Nuremberg.
[00:36:39.873 --> 00:36:40.733]  The Nazis sided.
[00:36:40.793 --> 00:36:43.254]  Hey, we were conferring with British and U.S.
[00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:43.795]  eugenics.
[00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:50.958]  Again, the first head of UNESCO that sets our policies on our parks and our schools and on cigarette taxes.
[00:36:50.978 --> 00:36:53.039]  I mean, they run our country under those treaties.
[00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:54.619]  It sets the standards, the global standards.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.602]  Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother, the first Director General of it,
[00:37:03.627 --> 00:37:09.911]  In 1954, he wrote and said that it's horrible to talk about eugenics as the people get mad, but we have to.
[00:37:11.012 --> 00:37:15.495]  He said, you know, after this Hitler thing, it's hard to talk about it, but we've got to because it's needed.
[00:37:17.036 --> 00:37:19.798]  And so, this is what they started pushing.
[00:37:20.198 --> 00:37:22.139]  And to understand, Hitler was theirs.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.082]  So they have this really sick excuse for doing it.
[00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:42.229]  If you go to any major university, in the psychology department, sociology department, the biology department, the different climatology sections of the different departments, this is all they talk about.
[00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:48.310]  I mean, go research your professor that studies desertification.
[00:37:49.131 --> 00:37:54.092]  Guaranteed, 90% of the time, he's going to be talking about how everyone needs to be killed.
[00:37:55.177 --> 00:37:55.837]  But don't stop there.
[00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:58.338]  Go talk to the most popular psychologist at the school.
[00:37:58.578 --> 00:37:59.658]  The guy that gets all the grants.
[00:37:59.718 --> 00:38:00.038]  Same thing.
[00:38:00.338 --> 00:38:04.199]  I mean, when I was going to school here locally in Austin, that's all I ever heard.
[00:38:04.459 --> 00:38:06.839]  When I would go hear a lecture, that's all I would hear.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.480]  I mean, they were talking about it in the algebra class.
[00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:14.161]  I wasn't good in math, so I was taking algebra in college.
[00:38:15.401 --> 00:38:20.562]  I mean, that's just... Oh, let me just stop and say, class, there's a people bomb, and we've got to reduce numbers.
[00:38:21.302 --> 00:38:23.583]  We've got to reduce numbers, and what China's doing is good.
[00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:30.552]  I remember being 18 years old sitting in college and watching the professor sit... I mean, it just... it was every class!
[00:38:31.612 --> 00:38:32.792]  That's how I learned about it!
[00:38:34.453 --> 00:38:35.613]  That's all they talk about!
[00:38:35.673 --> 00:38:37.453]  It's a religion, folks!
[00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:50.356]  They're the equivalent of the Christians who are out on the street corner yelling and screaming with their Bibles, you know, except Jesus today, but they... I mean, that's how vehement they are, but that's what they do in the colleges!
[00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:52.656]  It's a prerequisite!
[00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:57.921]  Every time I talk about this, we get callers, and we get emails from going, well, what's wrong with it?
[00:38:58.722 --> 00:39:11.209]  In fact, Dr. Pianka, the UT professor who said killed 90% of us, and Ebola needs to come, and it can't come soon enough, and he later said, you know, he knows his family don't have to die, but that's okay, he's ready to go first.
[00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:17.652]  I mean, these are cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs cult members, but at the top, they're cold-blooded manipulators.
[00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:22.615]  Oh, isn't it terrible, the desert lizard is dying, we must get rid of humans.
[00:39:25.135 --> 00:39:27.516]  Those very same universities, that very same crowd.
[00:39:28.296 --> 00:39:37.580]  Oh, they don't call to stop the rampant genetic engineering and chimera cross-species variants being made that threatens the very fabric of the biosphere.
[00:39:39.741 --> 00:39:48.764]  The oil companies fund the phony environmental movement and fund all the big publications and groups that are just busy stealing private property and trying to set up global taxes.
[00:39:50.555 --> 00:40:05.320]  I mean, the particulates out of car engines and the gases, I mean, they certainly aren't good overall, but compared to, you know, millions of gallons of nerve gas being dumped off the coast of North Carolina by the Navy, or the Delaware River having a million gallons of nerve gas dumped in it, they just said they'd do it.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.041]  Again, they're setting these precedents.
[00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:19.305]  All that's ignored, all that's off the table, then they use the growing crisis of the spiraling cancer and genetic problems and the sperm count plunging to then say, oh, we'll just take some of your farm and that'll fix it.
[00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:29.155]  I mean, this is an army of dehumanizers, and it's the perfect excuse for an elite that just wants total control over humanity.
[00:40:29.395 --> 00:40:31.017]  And then you say, well, why is the elite doing this?
[00:40:31.257 --> 00:40:32.418]  What do they say they're going to do?
[00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:50.992]  They openly write and state there's going to be a utopia world, and in their descriptions it shows people, you know, in just little Greek outfits, little togas, up on beautiful mountaintops, uh, kind of like, uh, oh, who was that great artist in the twenties who would do the pictures of the oak trees and the, uh,
[00:40:52.190 --> 00:41:21.083]  and the sunsets uh... doesn't matter i'm digressing here will pop my head in a minute uh... maxwell parish was called maxwell parish there was beautiful blue sky and that orange light on the oak trees i'm digressing excuse me but i've seen them describe it as that you know this maxwell parish and beautiful people and beautiful happiness kind of an eon flux uh... or or the uh... zardoz you know the film with uh...
[00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:37.232]  Sean Connery, where there's this tiny elite who sends out these extermination squads killing the wild humans, and the elite have these life extension technologies and live in this little island, but they've gone insane.
[00:41:37.472 --> 00:41:39.734]  Why do you think there's all these movies and things about this?
[00:41:40.255 --> 00:41:41.456]  Or movies like The Island?
[00:41:41.856 --> 00:41:44.578]  Where they, you know, have the people and take their organs or coma.
[00:41:45.018 --> 00:41:47.720]  Because that's what the elite are into!
[00:41:48.121 --> 00:42:06.153]  That's what Bill Joy, who's worth over four billion dollars, co-owner of Sun Microsystems, he wrote back in 2000, April issue of Wired Magazine, that he went to an elite meeting, and all they were talking about in this elite meeting, 250 people, he said, was how the future didn't need us and how they were going to exterminate us!
[00:42:06.253 --> 00:42:08.755]  I mean, do you understand?
[00:42:08.815 --> 00:42:09.976]  This is not a joke!
[00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:14.742]  They're building the extermination grid around us right now.
[00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:17.664]  They're going to phase it in in phases, but it's accelerating.
[00:42:19.706 --> 00:42:21.687]  This is the point I'm trying to make here.
[00:42:23.148 --> 00:42:24.669]  Hitler was a warm-up.
[00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:32.956]  And to get their chaos in place, to bring in their world government, they are overrunning the U.S.
[00:42:32.996 --> 00:42:34.217]  with third-world hordes.
[00:42:35.598 --> 00:42:38.500]  With the education system by design, they've dumbed down the population.
[00:42:40.071 --> 00:42:43.073]  They're poisoning us through the food and water supply in all manners.
[00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:44.735]  In all manner.
[00:42:46.796 --> 00:42:49.759]  And so many facets I want to go over here with this plan.
[00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:52.081]  But this is the plan.
[00:42:52.121 --> 00:42:54.462]  And listen, they're following every part of it.
[00:42:55.103 --> 00:43:00.067]  They're dotting every I, crossing every T. They're building it.
[00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:02.129]  Their adherents are all around us.
[00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:04.450]  You can go talk to them.
[00:43:05.431 --> 00:43:07.613]  They're in control of every major university.
[00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:14.056]  Again, when he was out in East Texas at a big college, Dr. Pianka, 95% standing ovation.
[00:43:14.576 --> 00:43:15.397]  When he was here at St.
[00:43:15.457 --> 00:43:18.359]  Edwards giving a speech, 95% standing ovation.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.621]  UT, 95% standing ovation.
[00:43:20.941 --> 00:43:24.044]  I mean, you're talking thousands of people, hundreds of people, depending on the meeting halls.
[00:43:24.244 --> 00:43:25.224]  We have the transcripts.
[00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:26.485]  We've had the witnesses on.
[00:43:26.525 --> 00:43:27.246]  It's been in the news.
[00:43:29.267 --> 00:43:31.169]  And the story isn't that he's up there saying it.
[00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:32.650]  They all say it, almost all.
[00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.252]  The story is that the students,
[00:43:36.172 --> 00:43:44.333]  The instructors, the tenured professors, they stand and they get tears in their eyes, folks, and when you see it, it is scary.
[00:43:46.994 --> 00:43:48.034]  Muy scary!
[00:43:48.934 --> 00:43:51.255]  And this stuff's been going on for 60, 70 years in this country.
[00:43:51.315 --> 00:43:55.215]  Why now does CNN and Fox and MSNBC put Bianca on?
[00:43:55.275 --> 00:43:55.775]  Why now?
[00:43:56.015 --> 00:43:58.736]  Because they're introducing you to it.
[00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:04.917]  Dick Cheney writes in the September 2000 PNAC, Rebuilding America's Defense, document
[00:44:05.652 --> 00:44:07.693]  All available on the website of BNAC.
[00:44:09.293 --> 00:44:10.673]  Signed by the 25 members.
[00:44:11.593 --> 00:44:12.534]  Jeb Bush and others.
[00:44:13.054 --> 00:44:18.695]  He says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bio-weapons in the media.
[00:44:19.195 --> 00:44:24.476]  We need to sell using bio-weapons to kill entire races!
[00:44:25.177 --> 00:44:29.678]  This is not Nutcase Pianka, this is Dick Cheney!
[00:44:31.278 --> 00:44:35.019]  This is Richard Cheney, the Vice President!
[00:44:37.017 --> 00:44:46.452]  When Ted Turner gets up at the National Press Club dinner and says there's too many useless eaters in the world, we need to reduce the population by 80%, he was a moderate.
[00:44:49.545 --> 00:44:50.065]  Remember that?
[00:44:50.606 --> 00:44:54.427]  When he tells Autobahn Society Magazine that, the exact quote.
[00:44:54.648 --> 00:45:08.234]  When Prince Philip funds the World Wildlife Fund, and says we need to reduce by 80 to 85 percent, and that he wants to come back reincarnated as a particularly deadly virus to contribute to human population reduction.
[00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:10.596]  These people own the oil companies!
[00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:12.276]  They own the roads!
[00:45:12.697 --> 00:45:13.577]  They own us!
[00:45:14.217 --> 00:45:14.738]  Okay?
[00:45:15.578 --> 00:45:17.840]  They're not playing around.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.922]  This isn't a joke.
[00:45:20.202 --> 00:45:22.724]  Their New World Order is about killing you.
[00:45:24.045 --> 00:45:26.167]  Just like that film Dr. No with James Bond.
[00:45:26.187 --> 00:45:29.549]  Ian Fleming, they love to throw in our face.
[00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.413]  He's sitting there in front of him and he says, he's questioning him, he says, do you expect me to talk?
[00:45:34.433 --> 00:45:37.816]  He goes, no Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[00:45:38.797 --> 00:45:40.138]  Okay, do you understand that?
[00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:45.142]  They don't care if cell phones fry your brain and you're addicted to using them.
[00:45:46.858 --> 00:45:49.440]  They know the mercury's killing you and brain-damaging you.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.242]  They know they put increased amounts of it in the flu shots.
[00:45:52.462 --> 00:45:55.004]  Even though the flu shot doesn't even cover the flu for the last five years.
[00:45:55.225 --> 00:45:56.045]  But the flu strain it is.
[00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:56.405]  They know.
[00:45:56.566 --> 00:45:57.486]  You'll still go out and do it.
[00:45:57.726 --> 00:45:59.208]  They're trying to hurt us.
[00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:00.168]  Do you understand that?
[00:46:00.388 --> 00:46:01.149]  And they say it!
[00:46:01.389 --> 00:46:02.230]  They don't hide it!
[00:46:04.772 --> 00:46:09.235]  And they think because we're stupid and don't fight it, that that's evidence that we deserve it to happen to us.
[00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:13.218]  And then somebody says, well how are they gonna, if they kill us all, how are they gonna get their taxes?
[00:46:13.498 --> 00:46:15.380]  If they kill us all, how are they gonna have a military?
[00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:19.335]  Well no, if they kill 90% of us, there'll be 500 million people left.
[00:46:22.417 --> 00:46:32.004]  And by the way, Pianka students and PhDs are writing dissertations that are public, which we've read on air, saying, he's not radical enough, we believe in 100% extinction!
[00:46:35.026 --> 00:46:35.646]  You understand?
[00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:41.150]  And the globalists are psychopathic killers, they love death folks, they will keep killing until it's two of them left in a room.
[00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:43.852]  How are they going to do it?
[00:46:44.292 --> 00:46:45.593]  Just type in Air Force
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.585]  By 2011, half a fleet will be drone.
[00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:52.169]  That's a Pentagon report last year.
[00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.116]  Half of the aircraft drone within just six years.
[00:46:57.278 --> 00:46:57.519]  Half.
[00:47:00.715 --> 00:47:05.497]  I sent Paul Watson a story the other day and he emailed back going, oh no, that was just a computer animation.
[00:47:05.897 --> 00:47:06.697]  He hadn't looked at the video.
[00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:17.642]  Samsung announces and they release, it's real, these new robots that are going to be used in policing that walk up and taser you if you don't submit for crowd control and they're deploying them in South Korea.
[00:47:17.842 --> 00:47:19.122]  They're deploying them now!
[00:47:19.862 --> 00:47:20.943]  A bunch of robots.
[00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:23.004]  I'm not talking about something on treads.
[00:47:23.044 --> 00:47:26.405]  I mean walking robots bristling with firepower.
[00:47:26.685 --> 00:47:29.106]  Lethal and non-lethal and less lethal weapon arrays.
[00:47:30.626 --> 00:47:32.988]  Again, computer programmed by tiny elites.
[00:47:34.009 --> 00:47:35.630]  We're talking T2 here, folks.
[00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:36.932]  This is here.
[00:47:39.334 --> 00:47:41.776]  Already they've got robotic space planes in orbit.
[00:47:41.856 --> 00:47:43.557]  That's come out in James Weapon's quarterly.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.660]  You understand?
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.342]  This is how they're going to be able to do it.
[00:47:48.862 --> 00:47:49.743]  Everything mechanized.
[00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:51.284]  Everything tracked with RFID.
[00:47:51.524 --> 00:47:56.709]  Which then makes the real world, like cyberspace, tracked in real time by their private internet.
[00:47:59.199 --> 00:48:00.440]  Everything under control.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.921]  Everything tracked.
[00:48:03.902 --> 00:48:05.083]  Banning the fast foods.
[00:48:05.363 --> 00:48:08.605]  Tracking how much red meat you eat off your national ID card.
[00:48:08.625 --> 00:48:09.746]  You're going to have to be swiping.
[00:48:09.926 --> 00:48:11.207]  They're now announcing all this, by the way.
[00:48:11.227 --> 00:48:12.508]  What I told you, they're now announcing.
[00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:15.070]  Banning smoking in your own house.
[00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.131]  Again, it set the precedent for total control.
[00:48:17.451 --> 00:48:21.574]  The whole country, the whole world, a giant prison.
[00:48:21.934 --> 00:48:24.476]  Cameras are in every public bathroom in Singapore.
[00:48:26.178 --> 00:48:34.062]  If you accidentally drop a piece of paper out of your pocket, it's instantly caught by camera, and if you live there, you are caned and fined tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:48:34.482 --> 00:48:36.203]  If you're not a citizen, they fine you.
[00:48:36.983 --> 00:48:47.488]  When that guy was on British Airways flying out of Singapore, the 67-year-old Australian, and made the joke about where would the terrorists have room to put bombs, he was charged under UN law by the Singapore government.
[00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:50.730]  That was in AP two days ago.
[00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:59.027]  And then the Houston police chief comes out six months ago and says we want to make citizens in Houston put cameras in their homes.
[00:48:59.528 --> 00:49:06.315]  Then Chicago announces two months ago they're going to make all the businesses put cameras in and hook them into police grids where they can watch you.
[00:49:07.136 --> 00:49:08.978]  Then Google announces calmly
[00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:21.845]  That all of the microphones, that are on almost all new computers, and almost all the new ones have the built-in... I went to the Apple Store last weekend, and all of them have cameras now.
[00:49:21.905 --> 00:49:23.306]  Every model has a camera and a microphone.
[00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:24.187]  Built-in.
[00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:25.448]  Into the screen.
[00:49:25.468 --> 00:49:26.169]  You can't take it off.
[00:49:26.189 --> 00:49:27.470]  It's at the top of the screen.
[00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:28.230]  A little black dot.
[00:49:29.691 --> 00:49:34.014]  And they said, we're listening to you right now with it, but don't worry, it's for data collection.
[00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:34.695]  It's no big deal.
[00:49:36.408 --> 00:49:54.420]  See, and I put a report out on it, and it's okay, gets a little attention, but, and I saw all the big technology blogs picked it up, and we got a few million readers, but they just said, well, okay, they're just, Google says that they just use an artificial intelligent computer system to keyword it, and then it finds out what your interests are, and then, you know, pops up those ads for you.
[00:49:55.941 --> 00:49:56.141]  See?
[00:49:56.441 --> 00:49:57.742]  They've brainwashed the public.
[00:49:57.802 --> 00:50:01.404]  Now, cameras and microphones listening to you, it's just normal.
[00:50:02.285 --> 00:50:02.505]  You see?
[00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:07.230]  And so this is the plan.
[00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:14.356]  And they'll carry out more and more attacks, get us more and more compact, more and more controlled, more and more surveilled, and it'll just be a process.
[00:50:14.996 --> 00:50:29.108]  And big wars, and always the new bio-release will be that shadowy terror group, and they'll even catch people and have the bearded person up there, and it'll be with the Anglo-Saxon looking scientists who help them, and oh, now you've got to watch everyone.
[00:50:30.566 --> 00:50:35.267]  And oh my gosh, the terrorists, oh, but the good security forces are coming to help.
[00:50:35.327 --> 00:50:39.508]  And no one will mind the fact that the global corporations are doing all of this.
[00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:40.308]  It's all fine.
[00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.289]  It's all fine and dandy.
[00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.190]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:50:49.091 --> 00:50:51.751]  And we'll go to Jason, who disagrees, and many others.
[00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:53.732]  We've got a guest coming up in about ten after in the next hour.
[00:50:53.752 --> 00:50:54.112]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:03.230]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.510]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:13.552]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:14.212 --> 00:51:21.273]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:21.674 --> 00:51:28.535]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:33.070]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.091]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:39.272]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:39.632 --> 00:51:43.533]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:56.624 --> 00:52:01.706]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:01.766 --> 00:52:09.069]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:52:09.229 --> 00:52:19.854]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:52:20.074 --> 00:52:24.596]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:52:24.896 --> 00:52:29.881]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:33.024]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:33.265 --> 00:52:43.134]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:52:43.154 --> 00:52:47.739]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium.
[00:52:47.819 --> 00:52:48.159]  We're good.
[00:52:56.514 --> 00:53:04.456]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:04.897 --> 00:53:08.078]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:54.994]  HerbalHealer.com, working with the power of nature.
[00:54:06.338 --> 00:54:07.759]  So it is pretty negative.
[00:54:07.799 --> 00:54:08.759]  It is pretty sad.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:09.900]  It's horrible.
[00:54:13.863 --> 00:54:22.468]  And they're going to use brainwash forces to carry it out or disconnected people who are controlling
[00:54:23.772 --> 00:54:31.434]  Mechanized forces from hundreds or thousands of miles away who were disconnected from the carnage they're wreaking.
[00:54:33.915 --> 00:54:34.995]  This is how they operate.
[00:54:35.935 --> 00:54:42.677]  And it's also the elite can have life extension technologies, the other technologies, for themselves.
[00:54:42.737 --> 00:54:44.037]  It's just ultimate greediness.
[00:54:45.357 --> 00:54:51.699]  Real greed, you know, isn't just wanting everything for yourself and not wanting others to have nice things.
[00:54:53.529 --> 00:54:58.411]  It's not wanting others to have ideas or information.
[00:54:58.792 --> 00:55:00.793]  Knowledge is real currency.
[00:55:02.514 --> 00:55:08.417]  And of course, the ultimate form of greediness and jealousy and envy and avarice is not wanting you to even have life.
[00:55:10.618 --> 00:55:13.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Connecticut.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.581]  Okay, you say you disagree, go ahead.
[00:55:17.162 --> 00:55:17.522]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:17.782 --> 00:55:18.603]  Yes, Jason, go ahead.
[00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:21.432]  Hey, I got your movie and everything, Terror Storm.
[00:55:21.512 --> 00:55:22.553]  It was a great movie.
[00:55:22.613 --> 00:55:24.154]  I recommend everybody to get it and stuff.
[00:55:24.194 --> 00:55:29.016]  And I listen to you daily and stuff and you have some very good, powerful information.
[00:55:29.036 --> 00:55:37.581]  I just, you know, a couple days ago you had a guest on that was from Pennsylvania who worked for the Department of Youth and Protective Services.
[00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.983]  And then you had a guy, a mancow on last night.
[00:55:42.243 --> 00:55:45.585]  And it looks like, you know, the guy in Pennsylvania, you really,
[00:55:46.124 --> 00:55:56.006]  Call them every name in the book you could think of and everything, but last night, I mean, you weren't really hard and very strong with Nancow, and I'm just wondering why your attitude changed like that.
[00:55:56.726 --> 00:56:05.108]  You know, if it was the other way around, if you were on Fox News or something, they would be cutting your mic, they'd be talking all over you, they'd be hard, but you didn't do any of that last night.
[00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:07.229]  You laughed with them and, you know.
[00:56:08.676 --> 00:56:11.418]  Well, I was letting him... I mean, I said what I was doing.
[00:56:11.438 --> 00:56:14.181]  I was illustrating how he didn't have any facts.
[00:56:14.661 --> 00:56:23.228]  I brought up probably 20 different facts, and he would say we were liars, that no fireman and police think 9-11 is an inside job, that we have actors.
[00:56:23.969 --> 00:56:27.031]  Well, see, that proves he's full of baloney right there.
[00:56:27.872 --> 00:56:29.453]  And I was there illustrating.
[00:56:29.473 --> 00:56:33.897]  I mean, I thought it... I mean, I have the same policy all the time.
[00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:35.398]  I'm not Fox News.
[00:56:35.498 --> 00:56:37.160]  I don't do what they do to me.
[00:56:38.899 --> 00:56:41.880]  I'm sorry to interrupt you there.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:46.261]  I just think you needed to be a lot harder and really a lot stronger than what you were.
[00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:47.881]  That's all.
[00:56:48.742 --> 00:56:49.682]  That's a good point.
[00:56:49.702 --> 00:56:51.162]  I don't know if I totally agree with you.
[00:56:52.123 --> 00:56:53.803]  Plus, I'm in different moods sometimes.
[00:56:54.863 --> 00:56:57.564]  I got really mad at the CPS guy because I hate those people.
[00:56:58.964 --> 00:57:01.225]  Mancow is not for CPS and grabbing all the kids.
[00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:04.712]  He, I don't know, he lied on your show.
[00:57:04.752 --> 00:57:09.195]  I mean, he said he was a sniper and then ten minutes later you had the 9-11 loose change going on.
[00:57:09.655 --> 00:57:17.619]  And, uh, you know, then he said he wasn't a, uh, you know, he wasn't a sniper and it was just... Yeah, we totally tore the guy into a hundred pieces.
[00:57:17.719 --> 00:57:22.342]  I mean... Hey, your Terror Storm video, I had a good suggestion on it for you.
[00:57:22.442 --> 00:57:23.422]  I really love the movie.
[00:57:23.442 --> 00:57:24.763]  We're having some friends over tonight.
[00:57:24.783 --> 00:57:28.085]  We're gonna pop it in the, uh, in the DVD player.
[00:57:28.618 --> 00:57:31.040]  Your box cover just doesn't grab my attention.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:39.827]  It has a map on it, and I think if you really wanted to get this thing up onto Amazon and really pump this thing, that other box cover will grab people's attention.
[00:57:40.007 --> 00:57:52.718]  Well, there's a green cover and a cream cover, and I like both designs so much, I printed up a bunch of each, and so you don't ever know what you're going to get, and so that's basically what happened.
[00:57:53.278 --> 00:57:58.265]  It just grabs your attention, because it has Bush on it, it has Blair and everything, and that's what you want to do.
[00:57:58.325 --> 00:58:00.208]  And you're going to put these out in the video stores and stuff.
[00:58:00.508 --> 00:58:03.131]  You want them to walk by the aisle and grab their attention, you know?
[00:58:03.532 --> 00:58:05.094]  Hey, what happened with your driver's license?
[00:58:05.134 --> 00:58:08.539]  I saw a video of you going into the Texas DMV.
[00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:11.197]  And you refused to get your fingerprints and stuff.
[00:58:11.217 --> 00:58:12.438]  Did that, whatever came along?
[00:58:12.498 --> 00:58:16.142]  I never, I never got a driver's license for four years after that.
[00:58:16.782 --> 00:58:21.907]  And then once the face scanning cameras went in, I had done that to illustrate the fact of the grid.
[00:58:21.927 --> 00:58:23.429]  Now we're in the grid.
[00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:26.231]  And so I have a driver's license.
[00:58:26.692 --> 00:58:27.853]  And that's a whole other subject.
[00:58:27.913 --> 00:58:29.835]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:30.836 --> 00:58:32.778]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:37.196 --> 00:58:41.439]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:41.459 --> 00:58:41.579]  Hello?
[00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:53.862]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.522 --> 00:58:55.563]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:56.283 --> 00:58:57.384]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:58.044 --> 00:58:58.845]  You want answers?
[00:58:59.626 --> 00:59:00.466]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.486 --> 00:59:04.849]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.369 --> 00:59:09.752]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:10.933 --> 00:59:12.714]  We'll be taking a lot of calls in this hour.
[00:59:12.734 --> 00:59:14.095]  At least I'll attempt it.
[00:59:15.056 --> 00:59:16.797]  A ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.291]  Bush was in Vietnam and said, you know what I learned from Vietnam?
[00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:22.072]  Not to quit.
[00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:23.692]  Talk about spin.
[00:59:24.032 --> 00:59:25.373]  He said, you guys didn't quit.
[00:59:25.413 --> 00:59:26.013]  You won.
[00:59:26.874 --> 00:59:28.234]  We're not going to quit in Iraq.
[00:59:28.254 --> 00:59:29.315]  And the Democrats agreed.
[00:59:30.215 --> 00:59:31.996]  20,000 more troops on their way.
[00:59:33.656 --> 00:59:35.237]  He voted the Democrats to get out of the war.
[00:59:35.277 --> 00:59:36.758]  And they say, you know what?
[00:59:36.858 --> 00:59:38.038]  We're going to get out of the war.
[00:59:38.078 --> 00:59:39.699]  But first, we're going to increase the troops.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:45.101]  Oh, you don't want to have all the toll roads, all the roads handed over to foreign companies.
[00:59:45.161 --> 00:59:46.142]  Well, we'll just do it.
[00:59:48.112 --> 00:59:51.315]  Oh, you don't like getting tasered over and over again when you can't even get up off the ground.
[00:59:51.335 --> 00:59:52.816]  How about we just taser you some more?
[00:59:55.439 --> 00:59:59.122]  Let's go ahead and talk to Crispin in New Orleans.
[00:59:59.162 --> 00:59:59.822]  You're on the air.
[00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:00.203]  Welcome.
[01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:01.244]  Thank you.
[01:00:01.324 --> 01:00:01.864]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:01.884 --> 01:00:02.465]  How you doing?
[01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:03.125]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:00:03.806 --> 01:00:06.728]  Hey, I wanted to call and thank you and thank your staff.
[01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.311]  You played an important role in helping me wake up.
[01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:14.055]  I first started looking into FEMA's actions after the hurricane.
[01:00:14.115 --> 01:00:15.196]  I'm from New Orleans here.
[01:00:16.215 --> 01:00:19.377]  And, uh, doing so, I came across your road to tyranny.
[01:00:20.418 --> 01:00:34.268]  And, uh, you just... I can't believe how much you've helped me wake up, and I've been trying to speak the truth to people that I know here in town, and the main thing I'm confronted with is their inability to believe that the government is competent
[01:00:36.788 --> 01:00:39.548]  Well, that's one of the most common things we hear.
[01:00:40.028 --> 01:00:46.670]  The bureaucracy is designed to be kind of a jello-like quicksand at the lower levels.
[01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:52.091]  But I assure you, the payoffs and the money deliveries are carried out with total precision.
[01:00:52.932 --> 01:00:55.032]  And there is a lot of incompetence in New Orleans.
[01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:58.733]  I'm not knocking the people there, but it is known as the real Sin City.
[01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:01.896]  And it's been, you know, corrupt ever since.
[01:01:01.916 --> 01:01:05.345]  It's been a pirate town, really the oldest city in the country.
[01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:07.921]  And so, I mean, what do you expect?
[01:01:08.321 --> 01:01:11.084]  So there is a lot of local incompetence.
[01:01:11.124 --> 01:01:16.649]  But I assure you, there's not incompetence when the CPS is grabbing people's kids, you know, that's scientifically executed.
[01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:20.193]  There's not incompetence when they put the fluoride in your water.
[01:01:20.713 --> 01:01:26.318]  There's not incompetence when they have people totally poor, so they've got to join the military to serve the empire.
[01:01:26.899 --> 01:01:30.482]  All of this, you know, the bureaucracy...
[01:01:31.846 --> 01:01:36.369]  The government's also meant to fall apart, so then they can say, oh, let us privatize it, see?
[01:01:36.909 --> 01:01:38.730]  There's a lot of different reasons for all of this.
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:39.810]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:01:40.951 --> 01:01:50.496]  Well, I just want to let you know also what a great tool TerrorStorm has been, and I appreciate very much that you allow us to copy and distribute your movie.
[01:01:50.516 --> 01:01:52.217]  I don't allow you to, I want you to.
[01:01:52.237 --> 01:01:53.458]  I ask you to.
[01:01:54.038 --> 01:01:55.299]  Well, I certainly have been.
[01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:59.061]  I'm fortunate enough, I work at a coffee shop, which is a cultural hub.
[01:01:59.795 --> 01:02:23.222]  We have district attorneys, lawyers, police officers, firemen, businessmen, service industry workers, everybody walks in this coffee shop and my boss allows me a space on the counter where I have been burning your movie and a few others and just leaving them with a note says free movie DVD five stars and I cannot seem to burn them fast enough regardless of the packaging.
[01:02:24.102 --> 01:02:25.603]  Are the police officers picking them up?
[01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:28.076]  Uh, yes sir.
[01:02:28.096 --> 01:02:29.377]  See, that's the psychology.
[01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:31.538]  If you run up to them and say, it's important, it's important, take it.
[01:02:31.738 --> 01:02:32.278]  They won't take it.
[01:02:32.298 --> 01:02:33.979]  They'll just go, hey, free film.
[01:02:34.579 --> 01:02:35.620]  You know, or just leave them out.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.460]  That's the way to do it.
[01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:38.601]  And it's regardless of the packaging.
[01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:44.364]  I mean, I'm putting handwritten on there, Alex Jones' Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:02:44.384 --> 01:02:45.705]  And they're like, oh wow, what's this?
[01:02:45.725 --> 01:02:46.365]  And they grab it.
[01:02:46.965 --> 01:02:51.147]  Uh, just the other day I gave a copy of your movie to the city attorney here in New Orleans.
[01:02:51.527 --> 01:02:52.027]  Good job.
[01:02:52.067 --> 01:02:52.928]  Well, what you ought to do
[01:02:54.273 --> 01:03:05.121]  Uh, and I tell you, that's what really wakes up to my films, is people who are in power positions, because they've actually been on the inside, not normally high enough to be doing something really evil, but then everything makes sense.
[01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:07.242]  How many special forces commanders?
[01:03:07.282 --> 01:03:08.203]  How many generals?
[01:03:08.583 --> 01:03:10.945]  How many congressmen and women have I talked to privately?
[01:03:11.525 --> 01:03:17.030]  Or heads of hospitals, or you name it, who say nothing made sense until I saw your films.
[01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:25.217]  Now, what I did in Korea, what I did in Nam, what I did in South, you know, what I did in the U.S., what I did in Latin America, now I understand.
[01:03:25.897 --> 01:03:26.758]  Because it's the truth.
[01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:30.601]  And the truth shines through the darkness every time.
[01:03:31.082 --> 01:03:34.305]  And hey, I don't care if you guys, if you start getting, if you have the money, give them out free.
[01:03:34.325 --> 01:03:36.226]  If you don't, sell them for a dollar.
[01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:37.808]  Get your money back.
[01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:39.947]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:03:40.488 --> 01:03:41.668]  Fightin' the New World Order.
[01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:47.290]  Stay with us.
[01:03:51.191 --> 01:03:52.471]  It's here.
[01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:57.393]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:57.793 --> 01:04:05.415]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:06.132 --> 01:04:13.173]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:24.995]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:25.315 --> 01:04:28.796]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:29.256 --> 01:04:31.196]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.536 --> 01:04:35.377]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:48.855 --> 01:04:54.077]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:04:54.237 --> 01:05:02.321]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:05:02.581 --> 01:05:09.624]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:05:09.804 --> 01:05:10.724]  We're good to go!
[01:05:36.852 --> 01:05:37.112]  I think?
[01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.367]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:53.669]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:53.444]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:53.824 --> 01:06:56.105]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:26.614 --> 01:07:28.595]  Well, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:28.775 --> 01:07:30.175]  I am glad that you have joined us.
[01:07:30.195 --> 01:07:35.536]  We're scheduled to have Michael Kaufman there, but the network's getting us contact info right now.
[01:07:35.556 --> 01:07:42.018]  And then we've got a city council member, actually a mayor pro tem coming on.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.961]  From one of these cities saying, look, we're not going to have illegal aliens here.
[01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:48.942]  Illegal is in the word.
[01:07:50.823 --> 01:07:55.324]  And it's causing the anti-American forces to go absolutely ape and assail them.
[01:07:56.064 --> 01:08:00.406]  So he's going to be joining us briefly in the third hour today.
[01:08:04.099 --> 01:08:13.782]  But before we go to Dr. Michael Kaufman, who I hope is still there when we try to contact him, let's go ahead and talk to Pat in Rhode Island.
[01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:14.882]  Pat, you're on the air.
[01:08:14.922 --> 01:08:15.382]  Go ahead.
[01:08:15.802 --> 01:08:16.522]  I'm from Rhode Island.
[01:08:16.562 --> 01:08:19.443]  I want to let you know first, I'm a graduate of the University of Notre Dame.
[01:08:19.743 --> 01:08:21.964]  I've got an electrical engineering degree from there.
[01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:23.744]  I'm also a graduate of St.
[01:08:23.824 --> 01:08:26.925]  Anselm College in New Hampshire with a liberal arts degree.
[01:08:26.945 --> 01:08:29.186]  So both sides of my brain work very well.
[01:08:30.101 --> 01:08:35.183]  First of all, thank you for the investment you've made in all matters, and I know it goes back before 9-11.
[01:08:36.384 --> 01:08:36.804]  Amazing.
[01:08:36.844 --> 01:08:38.044]  I put you on the front lines.
[01:08:38.085 --> 01:08:38.765]  You are the chief.
[01:08:39.225 --> 01:08:41.426]  You are the general of this movement.
[01:08:41.546 --> 01:08:43.967]  You know, everybody's been saying that.
[01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:45.608]  Now it's getting really bad all over the country.
[01:08:46.977 --> 01:08:53.520]  Old professors call up and call me the commander, and it really needs to stop, folks, because it's a good way to get me killed, real fast.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.100]  I am not the general.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:55.980]  I am not the leader.
[01:08:56.081 --> 01:08:58.241]  I am just... I am one person in the fight.
[01:08:58.321 --> 01:09:02.343]  You, all of you out there, are your own leaders in this fight, but thank you, sir.
[01:09:02.623 --> 01:09:05.604]  Okay, then let me come to the front lines right now with you.
[01:09:06.244 --> 01:09:15.568]  Nothing is going to change, Alex, unless the people who know what the truth is realize the fact that the truth being pointed out alone is not going to change anything
[01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:21.460]  When is this movement going to become a movement of action and not just a movement of preaching to the choir?
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.640]  I'm asking you, Alex.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.522]  We need this rocket, okay, to move from the first stage to the second stage.
[01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:38.546]  You know, I've talked to Eric Humschmid, who you probably know was probably the first American citizen to put together, other than yourself, to put together a collection
[01:09:39.505 --> 01:09:52.131]  I'm just saying that there are people who have been talking about this for years, okay?
[01:09:52.672 --> 01:10:05.318]  And I want to know, and I talked to him personally on the phone, I want to know when the change is going to be to civil disobedience and to real action, because how else, how else, and again, remember I'm a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, I'm not this
[01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.929]  Guy that's looking to, like, go into battle on any issue.
[01:10:09.309 --> 01:10:10.712]  How else are things going to change, Alex?
[01:10:10.752 --> 01:10:14.681]  I do not believe that if the American people, just by being informed of the truth...
[01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:20.373]  I do not believe that is going to organically, somehow, just change the direction of things.
[01:10:20.613 --> 01:10:22.755]  So, I want to ask you, are you willing to die?
[01:10:22.775 --> 01:10:23.875]  Are you willing to go to jail?
[01:10:23.895 --> 01:10:35.323]  Are you willing... Are you willing... Well, I've been to jail several times over this stuff, so... And I've been physically attacked, and I've gone through a lot of things I don't talk about on air because I don't do the enemy's job for them and intimidating people.
[01:10:35.843 --> 01:10:39.245]  Some of this stuff would scare people, but people can probably imagine.
[01:10:39.846 --> 01:10:40.386]  Number one,
[01:10:41.289 --> 01:10:46.771]  A lot of the folks calling for some violent clash or civil disobedience, they're not the people out there doing it.
[01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:47.672]  They're telling us to do it.
[01:10:47.712 --> 01:10:50.313]  Every day, and I'm about to go to Dr. Munkle Coppin, but your question's important.
[01:10:50.633 --> 01:10:51.633]  Let me just go over it with you.
[01:10:52.614 --> 01:10:55.435]  We are not done in the education phase.
[01:10:55.475 --> 01:11:09.401]  For a full decade, and that was with serious folks that would go to war quick, it took a decade plus and committees of correspondence to get the colonies mad enough to go to war with the British.
[01:11:10.544 --> 01:11:10.985]  Okay.
[01:11:11.625 --> 01:11:13.527]  And let them pull a couple more Waco's.
[01:11:13.547 --> 01:11:15.269]  Let them keep going down this line.
[01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:18.492]  Believe me, our strength is only going to continue to increase.
[01:11:18.512 --> 01:11:24.018]  That's why they're trying to pump in as many illegals as they can and give them special deals on buying houses.
[01:11:24.038 --> 01:11:27.241]  The big banks were in the AP two days ago.
[01:11:27.281 --> 01:11:27.962]  I saw the article.
[01:11:27.982 --> 01:11:29.083]  I heard Jack McClam talking about it.
[01:11:29.103 --> 01:11:29.804]  I went and pulled it up.
[01:11:30.725 --> 01:11:32.547]  They're, quote, trying to root them here.
[01:11:33.911 --> 01:11:35.692]  To, quote, stop the move to kick them out.
[01:11:36.052 --> 01:11:38.073]  I mean, they're doing everything they can to kill this country.
[01:11:38.353 --> 01:11:43.755]  Handing over the infrastructure, grabbing all the land, you know, putting us in... and you're about to hear about this from a real expert.
[01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.296]  So, we need to continue.
[01:11:47.356 --> 01:11:49.037]  The general public is not informed.
[01:11:49.077 --> 01:11:50.797]  The general public does not know the truth yet.
[01:11:51.097 --> 01:11:52.618]  They're starting to wake up.
[01:11:53.118 --> 01:12:00.881]  The government goes out and carries out terror attacks at OKC and other places just to create the illusion that we're violent.
[01:12:01.744 --> 01:12:04.265]  So they can try to use force to suppress us.
[01:12:04.605 --> 01:12:14.970]  It's not going to do anything to go out and burn down some buildings, have shootouts with dumbed down police in their little Darth Vader outfits.
[01:12:15.491 --> 01:12:16.891]  That doesn't hurt the New World Order.
[01:12:17.432 --> 01:12:18.912]  I'm going to expose David Rockefeller.
[01:12:19.152 --> 01:12:22.134]  I'm making a film about the Bilderberg.
[01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:25.816]  I'm going at the heart of the pyramid here, the eye of the capstone.
[01:12:26.536 --> 01:12:29.577]  And so it's a process, but I do go out and demonstrate.
[01:12:30.118 --> 01:12:30.758]  I tell people
[01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.953]  Stand up in restaurants and start yelling that 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:37.195]  I tell people to make copies of my films.
[01:12:37.636 --> 01:12:40.098]  I tell you not to take the vaccinations for your children.
[01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:41.559]  Take them out of public school.
[01:12:41.599 --> 01:12:41.999]  You know what?
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:48.986]  I heard a talk show host this week, last week, and say that the greatest example of liberty and people coming out of Babylon
[01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:50.332]  It's on the air.
[01:13:16.437 --> 01:13:17.178]  Yes, you're still there.
[01:13:17.198 --> 01:13:18.059]  What would you like me to do?
[01:13:18.239 --> 01:13:20.281]  Okay, Mike, I'm going to just make a prediction right now.
[01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:42.121]  I mean, I appreciate you giving some historical context to the matter and going back to the revolutionary days, but the bottom line is that the kind of weaponry and the kind of capabilities that our government has right now to reap destruction, and I'm not talking about planned destruction, I'm talking about kind of like, okay, the government getting together with some of their people and saying, you know, in the next three days we need to make something happen.
[01:13:43.242 --> 01:13:57.813]  My point is this, if we don't make something happen, if we don't do something unexpected as a movement, I mean, if we don't have the cajongas to do what they have the cajongas to do... Well, I think at this point, I mean, people parachuting into football stadiums with huge banners out behind them.
[01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.054]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:13:59.474 --> 01:14:01.336]  You know, spray painting government buildings.
[01:14:01.376 --> 01:14:02.857]  I mean, it is an emergency.
[01:14:03.653 --> 01:14:09.417]  situation and people need to non-violently stand up however they can, but I'm not saying do that.
[01:14:09.457 --> 01:14:10.557]  I'm using that as an example.
[01:14:10.898 --> 01:14:16.141]  Somebody will parachute in naked just for attention, but they won't parachute in for their country.
[01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:21.484]  I tell you, when you get the silver bullet, you call up and you tell me what it is.
[01:14:21.685 --> 01:14:22.205]  I know this.
[01:14:22.445 --> 01:14:26.027]  I, like a woodpecker, have stayed focused on fighting the New World Order.
[01:14:26.448 --> 01:14:31.791]  When I learned about this 15 years ago, when I got on air 12 years ago, I had a mission to fight the New World Order.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:40.525]  And to not just sit around and strategize and talk about big grand plans, just to educate people, take action, tell people to stand up, do the right thing.
[01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:47.029]  I have enough confidence in the native intelligence of the people to form a unified resistance.
[01:14:47.089 --> 01:14:53.033]  Listen, they were putting thumb scanners in to get school lunches and face scanners eight years ago.
[01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:55.375]  Now, in California, in London,
[01:14:55.965 --> 01:15:00.608]  You know, in Sacramento, in London, parents are saying no, and they're having to remove the thumb scanners.
[01:15:01.048 --> 01:15:03.690]  People are saying no to RFID chips around the kids' necks.
[01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:06.032]  You know, the people now are getting mad.
[01:15:06.072 --> 01:15:06.872]  I've got to let you go.
[01:15:06.892 --> 01:15:11.896]  We somehow got our wires crossed, and my producer was out.
[01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:13.076]  We didn't get the number to the network.
[01:15:13.116 --> 01:15:16.239]  I apologize that Dr. Kaufman has been holding for about five minutes.
[01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:20.101]  But I'm really honored to have him with us.
[01:15:20.121 --> 01:15:21.222]  I haven't interviewed him in years.
[01:15:21.912 --> 01:15:26.615]  We've only got about 45 minutes with him now, but I've got to get him up for two hours in the future.
[01:15:26.715 --> 01:15:29.156]  I am carrying his new video.
[01:15:29.256 --> 01:15:36.900]  It's absolutely amazing and powerful and something Christians need to have, but just Americans, period, need to have.
[01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:40.582]  His bio is too lengthy to ever even go through.
[01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:43.864]  I want him in a nutshell to basically tell you who he is.
[01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:54.778]  He, of course, put the maps together with the government documents and information he had of where over 90% of the country will be restricted, over half of it total restriction of human use.
[01:15:55.179 --> 01:16:04.088]  The corridors he put together in the mid-90s are now exactly where they're announcing their corridors now, where they're saying they're going to shut off human use.
[01:16:04.788 --> 01:16:06.390]  Everything he's saying is happening.
[01:16:07.311 --> 01:16:11.334]  He has done an incredible job on the North American Union, on all of it.
[01:16:11.995 --> 01:16:15.217]  And Dr. Michael Kaufman, a professor, thank you for coming on.
[01:16:15.297 --> 01:16:20.722]  Tell us about yourself, who you are, the work you've done, in a nutshell.
[01:16:21.523 --> 01:16:22.284]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:16:23.104 --> 01:16:24.646]  It is a pleasure to be back on with you.
[01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:28.469]  It has been about a year and a half, two years, I think, since we talked to each other.
[01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:34.600]  But nonetheless, I have a PhD in Ecosystems Analysis, actually Environmental Sciences.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:50.264]  But yet, when I began to see, I was leading a multi-million dollar research effort back in the 1980s, and I began to realize that the environmental leadership and many of our government agencies were not interested in protecting the environment, they were interested in gaining control.
[01:16:50.844 --> 01:16:53.665]  Which pricked my interest into finding out exactly why.
[01:16:53.805 --> 01:16:55.545]  And I entered this whole battle scene
[01:16:56.058 --> 01:17:00.256]  In the late 1980s, investigating what in the world was going on with the environmental movement,
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:08.623]  Well, it doesn't take long before you start connecting the dots, and it goes right back up to the global agenda, the Rockefellers, the Trilateral Commissions, and so forth.
[01:17:08.823 --> 01:17:10.944]  Population reduction.
[01:17:11.744 --> 01:17:13.205]  What is the grand plan?
[01:17:13.225 --> 01:17:14.225]  And people get confused here.
[01:17:14.685 --> 01:17:18.647]  Real environmentalism, conservation, is important and is real.
[01:17:18.947 --> 01:17:24.749]  The people running it, though, are the ones dumping the chemicals in the ocean, making the genetically engineered crops.
[01:17:24.809 --> 01:17:26.230]  They're the ones actually hurting the earth.
[01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:27.751]  Well, our basic goal is to do two things.
[01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:30.652]  One is to create a world religion, which they're doing through environmentalism.
[01:17:31.012 --> 01:17:33.053]  It's basically the idea that the Earth is God.
[01:17:55.293 --> 01:17:59.014]  You've heard of the so-called Gaia Hypothesis and so forth.
[01:17:59.034 --> 01:18:02.075]  And this is official UN treaties, laws, they say this.
[01:18:02.735 --> 01:18:03.055]  Yes.
[01:18:03.216 --> 01:18:23.902]  In fact, we came within just a few hours in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg of having a New Earth Ethic, which we'll let them call it, but it's really a New Earth Religion instilled as a guiding ethic for the United Nations for every single person on planet Earth.
[01:18:24.488 --> 01:18:29.813]  Christian, non-Christian, you name it, would have to ascribe to if they wanted to be sanctioned by the government.
[01:18:30.474 --> 01:18:39.963]  We came within a couple hours of having that thing actually accepted by the United Nations, and we finally got the State Department to pull the language out of the consensus document just before that.
[01:18:39.983 --> 01:18:40.644]  Well, stay there, stay there.
[01:18:40.664 --> 01:18:41.545]  We got a break, Doctor.
[01:18:41.565 --> 01:18:43.527]  When we come back, we'll get right to it.
[01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:44.248]  Stay with us.
[01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:54.803]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:18:56.023 --> 01:19:00.846]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:01.066 --> 01:19:03.787]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:03.827 --> 01:19:04.968]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:19:06.289 --> 01:19:10.891]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:19.015]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.461]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:28.742]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:19:29.722 --> 01:19:30.982]  Call for your copy today.
[01:19:31.242 --> 01:19:33.442]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:40.344]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:41.444]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.504 --> 01:19:41.704]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:49.648 --> 01:19:52.089]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:52.809 --> 01:19:56.451]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:19:57.091 --> 01:20:00.973]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:20:01.653 --> 01:20:10.257]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:20:11.217 --> 01:20:18.380]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[01:20:19.309 --> 01:20:27.434]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:28.555 --> 01:20:31.036]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:31.056 --> 01:20:31.877]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:31.897 --> 01:20:32.137]  Call now.
[01:20:32.197 --> 01:20:35.920]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:20:49.102 --> 01:20:50.944]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:52.805]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:20:53.225 --> 01:20:53.466]  What?
[01:20:53.826 --> 01:20:54.186]  Again?
[01:20:54.607 --> 01:20:56.228]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:20:56.308 --> 01:21:00.731]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:21:00.952 --> 01:21:02.233]  Why did you do that?
[01:21:02.453 --> 01:21:08.257]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:21:08.558 --> 01:21:09.579]  Are we there yet?
[01:21:09.679 --> 01:21:10.760]  for the entire trip.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.201]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:21:13.682 --> 01:21:14.683]  Great idea.
[01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:17.465]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:21:17.904 --> 01:21:20.389]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:21:20.589 --> 01:21:24.978]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:21:25.258 --> 01:21:25.559]  Honey!
[01:21:26.383 --> 01:21:27.624]  You're terrific!
[01:21:28.024 --> 01:21:29.505]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:33.027]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:21:33.327 --> 01:21:34.088]  Now, can we stop?
[01:21:34.608 --> 01:21:35.328]  I need to go, too.
[01:21:35.628 --> 01:21:40.091]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:21:48.596 --> 01:21:53.441]  The Japanese have used magnetic therapy for thousands of years, and it's more popular today than ever before.
[01:21:53.661 --> 01:22:01.930]  Established in 2000, Arizona Unipol Magnetics, AUM, is the number one online source for the superb Dr. Philpott-approved polar power magnetics.

[01:22:10.098 --> 01:22:10.518]  I think so.

[01:23:13.992 --> 01:23:20.737]  Welcome back.
[01:23:20.817 --> 01:23:25.961]  Glad that you joined us.
[01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:28.503]  Dr. Michael Kaufman will be with us in about five minutes in the next hour.
[01:23:28.543 --> 01:23:28.964]  Then I've got a
[01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:37.386]  Dallas-Fort Worth Area Mayor coming on to talk about the illegal alien problem and what we're dealing with there, all part of the Global Plan.
[01:23:38.026 --> 01:23:41.947]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, again, you've been studying this for decades now.
[01:23:42.027 --> 01:23:43.347]  You've made quite a few films.
[01:23:43.687 --> 01:23:56.730]  We're carrying your newest, which is just an amazing, World Events and Prophecy, because this really reaches out to Christians, which I count myself among, from a biblical perspective, but then showing the documents, and it does fit hand-in-glove.
[01:23:57.070 --> 01:24:00.571]  The elite really do, at the end of the day, worship Lucifer.
[01:24:01.335 --> 01:24:03.477]  And for atheists out there, they just can't get that.
[01:24:03.757 --> 01:24:05.938]  That the elite do believe in God and the devil.
[01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:09.121]  They just think the devil is God, but I'm kind of putting the cart before the horse.
[01:24:09.661 --> 01:24:11.442]  How are they using the environmental movement?
[01:24:11.542 --> 01:24:14.345]  What will life be like in America under this system?
[01:24:14.385 --> 01:24:14.905]  Are they continuing?
[01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:30.156]  Well, you know, one of the things that really we were fighting for back in 2002 is to keep this from becoming the United Nations religion that would then be forced down on every person in every nation because right on its heels was a brand new treaty
[01:24:30.839 --> 01:24:42.366]  That would, it was called the Covenant on Environment and Development, that would have put this in the legal teeth that you would have been forced to, at the point of a gun, to adhere to these very principles of pantheism, that the Earth is God.
[01:24:42.587 --> 01:24:54.714]  And it's the very same stuff we see in Europe, where if a ten-year-old girl is in a study group with a bunch of foreigners who can't speak English, and she says, I want to be in a different group, they arrest her and put her in a jail cell, saying it was hateful.
[01:24:55.535 --> 01:24:57.056]  Yes, absolutely, same thing.
[01:24:57.814 --> 01:24:59.116]  I don't think so.
[01:25:17.133 --> 01:25:22.195]  The freedom of making a choice of how you use your property, be it a house or your land or even money.
[01:25:22.235 --> 01:25:23.156]  Money is property too.
[01:25:23.176 --> 01:25:31.180]  You're not going to be allowed to do that because everything is spelled out and everything is designed to protect Mother Earth, who they believe is God.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:38.403]  They believe that we've been basically destroying Mother Earth or God with all the modern conveniences and so forth.
[01:25:38.423 --> 01:25:42.565]  We're not sustainable in their eyes and we would go back a hundred years in our technology
[01:25:43.294 --> 01:25:46.716]  If they've ever gone into actual principle and into effect.
[01:25:46.756 --> 01:25:48.917]  And that's the key word there is sustainability.
[01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:52.479]  That's their excuse to grab property to control populations.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:57.422]  And again, in their real actions, the very global corporations funding this, they're doing the opposite.
[01:25:57.462 --> 01:25:59.404]  They're the ones that are really hurting the earth.
[01:26:00.464 --> 01:26:01.004]  Absolutely.
[01:26:01.105 --> 01:26:02.986]  You know, that's the ironic thing about this.
[01:26:03.166 --> 01:26:06.868]  It's the major international or transnational corporations
[01:26:07.327 --> 01:26:14.891]  And the financial institutes, the major banks of the world and so forth, and I explain all this in the DVD, that are actually doing the damage.
[01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:17.732]  They can care less about the environment.
[01:26:18.132 --> 01:26:20.553]  And they can care less about homosexuals either.
[01:26:20.593 --> 01:26:23.415]  They just make it all sound loving and liberal.
[01:26:23.755 --> 01:26:28.117]  Oh, you're going to all be sweet to each other, or the men in black uniforms will come and arrest you.
[01:26:29.438 --> 01:26:30.618]  Yeah, and that is very true.
[01:26:30.638 --> 01:26:36.441]  And the only way they can gain control is to impose this religion, because religion is the one thing that will unite people.
[01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:46.149]  And they're trying to impose this, they have been now for 30 years or more, and trying to impose it so that everybody is in favor of protecting the environment no matter what the cost.
[01:26:46.249 --> 01:26:51.653]  And boy, have they been successful, because it's called the Greening of America, and I talk about it in the DVD.
[01:26:52.374 --> 01:27:00.179]  They have changed us from an entrepreneurial viewpoint of reality to an environmental viewpoint here in this country.
[01:27:00.199 --> 01:27:06.923]  Which then gets us to hand away our own sovereignty and control and start thinking in group thinking.
[01:27:07.163 --> 01:27:19.751]  All the TV shows, all the children's shows, the propaganda is everywhere that humans are bad and the state's going to punish those bad humans and keep them in line, but that's really just other humans who are going to be having the control.
[01:27:20.552 --> 01:27:20.992]  That's right.
[01:27:21.513 --> 01:27:25.275]  Which brings up the second point, the second goal that they have is that they want
[01:27:25.737 --> 01:27:26.458]  Total control.
[01:27:26.478 --> 01:27:28.440]  They want to have a world government.
[01:27:28.801 --> 01:27:36.710]  It's probably going to be administered through the United Nations, but the United Nations, as evil as it will be, will not be the people that are pulling the strings on it.
[01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:40.875]  They will be the international financiers and so forth, the global elite.
[01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:44.131]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:27:45.451 --> 01:27:53.436]  I found out that Dutch Royal Shell 10 years ago, and BBC broke this, put out the peak oil fraud.
[01:27:53.976 --> 01:27:56.798]  When you open up National Geographic, it's total anti-human.
[01:27:57.258 --> 01:28:00.880]  When you open it up, the whole thing is financed by Dutch Shell.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.000]  They must have five ads.
[01:28:03.241 --> 01:28:03.901]  It's sick!
[01:28:04.682 --> 01:28:05.382]  It really is.
[01:28:05.642 --> 01:28:06.603]  It's an amazing thing.
[01:28:07.433 --> 01:28:09.494]  They call it the public-private partnerships.
[01:28:09.514 --> 01:28:10.955]  I don't get that into this DVD.
[01:28:11.015 --> 01:28:12.796]  I do in other DVDs that I've done.
[01:28:13.257 --> 01:28:20.901]  But these public-private partnerships basically put industry, these international corporations, in charge of government.
[01:28:21.461 --> 01:28:22.602]  I do discuss this.
[01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:25.944]  You know, Carol Quigley, you've probably talked about him many times.
[01:28:26.357 --> 01:28:26.677]  Stay there.
[01:28:26.697 --> 01:28:28.979]  We'll break down the global plantation on the other side.
[01:28:29.019 --> 01:28:29.560]  Long segment.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.440]  We're on the march.
[01:28:30.461 --> 01:28:31.261]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:32.402]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:49.781 --> 01:28:52.203]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:56.026]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:28:56.386 --> 01:28:59.349]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:28:59.609 --> 01:29:05.994]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:29:06.054 --> 01:29:10.478]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:29:10.698 --> 01:29:15.064]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:29:15.224 --> 01:29:17.827]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:29:17.868 --> 01:29:20.631]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:29:21.092 --> 01:29:23.635]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:29:23.675 --> 01:29:27.941]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:29:27.981 --> 01:29:28.822]  Treasury bonds.
[01:29:29.102 --> 01:29:33.727]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:29:33.908 --> 01:29:35.549]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:35.569 --> 01:29:37.552]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.924]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:29:54.224 --> 01:29:59.668]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:29:59.708 --> 01:30:03.992]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:07.354]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:07.674 --> 01:30:11.097]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:11.437 --> 01:30:20.787]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:21.047 --> 01:30:24.551]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:31.879]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:33.500]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[01:30:48.294 --> 01:30:54.319]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.142]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big businesses.
[01:31:00.674 --> 01:31:01.255]  I think so.
[01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.850]  I think so.
[01:31:54.773 --> 01:32:04.275]  I've seen one of his other films online years ago, but this one is really important.
[01:32:04.295 --> 01:32:04.956]  You need to have it.
[01:32:06.496 --> 01:32:09.857]  It's World Events and Prophecy DVD.
[01:32:10.677 --> 01:32:12.137]  One World Government, One World Religion.
[01:32:12.658 --> 01:32:14.498]  The Ten Nation Confederacy of Daniel.
[01:32:15.541 --> 01:32:19.383]  The Mark of the Beast, a scholar of geo-politics and prophecy.
[01:32:19.423 --> 01:32:23.224]  Dr. Kaufman has an opportunity to witness things that are kept from the general public.
[01:32:23.645 --> 01:32:30.848]  Few people are aware that there are five major power factions in the world fighting among themselves over who will dominate the emerging world government.
[01:32:30.908 --> 01:32:33.729]  Yeah, they all support the world government while fighting with each other.
[01:32:33.769 --> 01:32:34.609]  That's the key.
[01:32:35.069 --> 01:32:40.052]  Just like Mafia, Dons, and the Godfather, which is a true story, all meet once a year, but the rest of the year they're fighting.
[01:32:40.632 --> 01:32:43.333]  Or that a world religion came within hours of being accepted.
[01:32:44.681 --> 01:32:46.903]  The world is being divided into 10 economic units.
[01:32:46.983 --> 01:32:54.227]  Americans are only now becoming aware that our government is rapidly becoming a North American Union with Canada and Mexico patterned after the European Union.
[01:32:54.307 --> 01:32:57.929]  Finally, the technology now exists to create a mark of the beast of Revelation 13.
[01:32:57.969 --> 01:33:04.533]  Dr. Coffman explains these world events and the occult, meaning of 666 in this DVD.
[01:33:05.073 --> 01:33:06.654]  This is perfect for churches.
[01:33:07.549 --> 01:33:14.333]  I mean, you might try to take a terror storm into your local Baptist church, and the preacher would probably watch it, have a heart attack, and not let you play it.
[01:33:14.853 --> 01:33:16.334]  This you can show in Sunday school.
[01:33:16.934 --> 01:33:18.295]  This you can show at your church.
[01:33:18.915 --> 01:33:24.558]  This is very well done, very calmly done, all documented, and then he parallels it.
[01:33:24.798 --> 01:33:28.140]  It's very effective, and I've done my homework on this.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.862]  It's extremely accurate.
[01:33:31.882 --> 01:33:36.765]  $18.95, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.021]  Or prisonplanet.com.

[01:33:41.541 --> 01:33:46.903]  I don't think I've registered it yet with my operators, but later today you'll be able to also get it by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:47.184 --> 01:33:52.185]  I haven't put that in the product code yet for them.
[01:33:53.026 --> 01:33:56.547]  But you can go to infowars.com and get it right now, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:34:00.376 --> 01:34:05.818]  We're going to go back to Dr. Michael Kaufman, and then we're going to go to Bion in Vietnam, who's from Vietnam, holding.
[01:34:05.878 --> 01:34:08.519]  We get calls all over the world now with his IP over phone.
[01:34:09.459 --> 01:34:10.779]  Voice over IP, whatever you call it.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:17.701]  And Nick, Jeff, NWO, everybody that's patiently holding, we're going to get to you.
[01:34:18.722 --> 01:34:23.203]  But TerrorStorm went to number 17 and went higher than that a few weeks ago.
[01:34:23.883 --> 01:34:27.305]  And it sat there for many hours, more than 10 hours.
[01:34:27.345 --> 01:34:28.685]  I quit watching after 10 hours.
[01:34:30.054 --> 01:34:31.834]  And now it's settled back to thirty-something.
[01:34:31.874 --> 01:34:37.755]  But again, thank you for driving it now two-plus weeks that it's been in the top hundred or higher.
[01:34:38.916 --> 01:34:39.796]  It's three weeks, really.
[01:34:40.836 --> 01:34:45.757]  And it's at Amazon.com for twelve dollars and some change.
[01:34:46.537 --> 01:34:48.997]  And it's the most powerful film I've ever made.
[01:34:49.037 --> 01:34:50.678]  The history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:34:51.098 --> 01:34:52.898]  How they control the, quote, radical groups.
[01:34:53.458 --> 01:34:54.718]  How they light us into war.
[01:34:55.179 --> 01:34:56.439]  The police state they're setting up.
[01:34:56.479 --> 01:34:57.499]  The torture of children.
[01:34:58.493 --> 01:35:00.255]  And then it's got 68 minutes of extras.
[01:35:00.515 --> 01:35:01.936]  The film's almost two hours long.
[01:35:01.956 --> 01:35:07.440]  And then it's got 68 minutes of extras on the same DVD.
[01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:08.781]  Okay?
[01:35:09.582 --> 01:35:11.944]  So again, it's such an important film.
[01:35:11.984 --> 01:35:14.726]  Please get Terror Storm, or get it from InfoWars.com.
[01:35:14.746 --> 01:35:18.369]  You can get Aaron Russo's new America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:35:19.136 --> 01:35:23.857]  Credible film on the private Federal Reserve and the IRS and what they're doing and the North American Union.
[01:35:23.997 --> 01:35:25.597]  Very important film for $19.95.
[01:35:26.478 --> 01:35:28.078]  And get Terror Storm with it for $9.95.
[01:35:28.358 --> 01:35:32.099]  And if you already have Terror Storm, you can't beat that deal, $9.95.
[01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:34.479]  It's an even better deal than Amazon.
[01:35:35.019 --> 01:35:36.019]  Get it and give it as a gift.
[01:35:36.059 --> 01:35:39.600]  You know, get freedom to fascism for yourself and get Terror Storm and give it as a gift.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.440]  The gift of knowledge.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.021]  Again, InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:48.522 --> 01:35:56.245]  We're going to be going to your calls here in a little while, but again, I hope you will call or I hope you will go to the website and get the World Events and Prophecy.
[01:35:56.765 --> 01:36:02.688]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, please continue with basically what the grand plan is.
[01:36:02.728 --> 01:36:03.528]  This is all written out.
[01:36:03.988 --> 01:36:08.210]  What will life be like if they're able to get this program in place?
[01:36:09.233 --> 01:36:11.455]  Well, basically it means a controlled society.
[01:36:11.815 --> 01:36:15.817]  You're allowed to make certain decisions by yourself, but everything else is controlled.
[01:36:15.857 --> 01:36:22.741]  You can only make those decisions within very narrowly defined limits as to what you can do and not do.
[01:36:22.901 --> 01:36:33.548]  In fact, this is actually part of, as Evgeny Brzezinski basically said this 30 years ago, that there will become a time when we finally get to that point where we
[01:36:34.195 --> 01:36:36.238]  I think you really got a nail on the head there, Alex, because
[01:36:49.884 --> 01:36:55.006]  We have to understand that they're going to use a lot of pseudonyms to describe this as something wonderful.
[01:36:55.546 --> 01:37:04.670]  In fact, the whole idea of this environmental lockstep that they're talking about is supposed to be a wonderful life to have this freedom of nature and so forth.
[01:37:05.137 --> 01:37:13.979]  Well in fact it means abject poverty because we can't do anything to benefit mankind if it causes nature some sort of problem.
[01:37:13.999 --> 01:37:18.580]  Well there's nothing that we can do that doesn't impact nature somewhat in a negative way.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:25.142]  But let's look at the microscopic view here locally in Austin.
[01:37:26.036 --> 01:37:30.217]  Ninety-eight, they grabbed 15,000 acres in one land grab for a decade before.
[01:37:30.257 --> 01:37:32.138]  They wouldn't let people build on their own property.
[01:37:32.498 --> 01:37:35.439]  That drove down the value by 90 plus percent in most areas.
[01:37:35.779 --> 01:37:54.785]  Then they made a deal to pay the people about five cents on the dollar for their property and swore that the huge, you know, multi-hundred million dollar buy in southwest Travis County in a key, beautiful area to build, very valuable real estate, that there'd be this huge park
[01:37:55.345 --> 01:37:55.866]  They took it.
[01:37:56.146 --> 01:37:57.628]  There is no park being built.
[01:37:57.668 --> 01:38:01.311]  It was then given to select Fortune 500 management companies.
[01:38:01.672 --> 01:38:07.297]  Nature Conservancy Sierra Club are now building huge developments all over it.
[01:38:07.578 --> 01:38:14.845]  They grabbed land in East Austin and built a five-star golf course, spa, and luxury retreat.
[01:38:15.486 --> 01:38:18.609]  And so really, it's about stealing property.
[01:38:19.381 --> 01:38:19.661]  It is.
[01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:36.905]  In fact, if you look at the whole Smart Growth Agenda, and I do have another DVD on Smart Growth that I'll be sending you so you can look at it, but the whole Smart Growth Agenda is designed to take property away from the individual and put it into this never-never land that they can eventually use themselves.
[01:38:37.025 --> 01:38:44.447]  In fact, the Wildlands Project, which was part of the Convention on Biological Diversity that we stopped back in 1994 from being ratified in the U.S.
[01:38:44.487 --> 01:38:48.728]  Senate, that would set aside one-half of the United States into wilderness areas.
[01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:50.011]  What's the purpose of this?
[01:38:50.051 --> 01:38:53.415]  Well, it's supposed to be protecting biodiversity, but they don't care about biodiversity.
[01:38:53.735 --> 01:38:59.702]  They want to lock that land up, one, as collateral on the national debt that you were just talking about.
[01:38:59.722 --> 01:39:04.328]  And I had Joseph Stiklitz, Chief Economist, World Bank, Nobel Prize winner, on three weeks ago.
[01:39:04.368 --> 01:39:05.789]  He said exactly what you just said.
[01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:07.091]  Absolutely.
[01:39:07.391 --> 01:39:08.893]  That is exactly what they're trying to do.
[01:39:09.378 --> 01:39:14.223]  And once they have it, then they will start to develop that land through its resources and so forth.
[01:39:14.524 --> 01:39:16.546]  The money will go in their pockets, not ours.
[01:39:24.276 --> 01:39:25.717]  But Mike Hanson has most of them.
[01:39:25.737 --> 01:39:29.160]  I need him to dig those out of his storage for the three-quarter inch tapes to fall apart.
[01:39:29.541 --> 01:39:30.121]  But I didn't.
[01:39:30.201 --> 01:39:32.243]  I mean, I knew it was a land grab, but I went to it.
[01:39:32.704 --> 01:39:35.727]  There were thousands of people at the new Austin Convention Center at the time.
[01:39:36.187 --> 01:39:43.634]  There were former Dallas Cowboys and Bank One Chairman and Bank of America Chairman and big Republicans and Michael Dell.
[01:39:44.575 --> 01:39:45.857]  But this wasn't for the media.
[01:39:45.877 --> 01:39:48.139]  This was for all the city managers of the whole country.
[01:39:48.843 --> 01:39:49.103]  I know it.
[01:40:11.187 --> 01:40:13.351]  And that's of course the fault of the liberal media.
[01:40:13.712 --> 01:40:17.678]  And if you talk to some of these individual reporters, you'll find that they agree with it.
[01:40:17.718 --> 01:40:18.880]  They think it's a great idea.
[01:40:19.061 --> 01:40:19.321]  Why?
[01:40:19.401 --> 01:40:21.164]  Because that's where they have been educated.
[01:40:21.745 --> 01:40:24.871]  And that's why we should get our kids out of schools and teach them
[01:40:25.907 --> 01:40:33.834]  The facts of life at home and hopefully they will stick with them when they go through college because right now our colleges are nothing more than indoctrination camps.
[01:40:34.214 --> 01:40:34.715]  Exactly.
[01:40:34.755 --> 01:40:36.956]  You've been to a lot of these meetings.
[01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:38.358]  You've studied their documents.
[01:40:38.398 --> 01:40:39.018]  You've talked to them.
[01:40:39.298 --> 01:40:47.365]  When you talk to the minions though, the cannon fodder that buys into it, are you able to ever deprogram them and show the environmentalists that it has nothing to do with the environment?
[01:40:48.006 --> 01:40:48.246]  Yes.
[01:40:48.326 --> 01:40:53.370]  In fact, Alex, when I've given talks in the past, we've had some of these plants in the Sierra Club.
[01:40:53.863 --> 01:40:58.365]  Or the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which is an international environmental organization.
[01:40:58.705 --> 01:41:01.046]  Very powerful, extremely powerful organization.
[01:41:01.506 --> 01:41:10.751]  There to discredit me, and if they let me have the time to develop it logically, I've seen them go into a state of shock as they realize what they're involved in.
[01:41:10.911 --> 01:41:11.311]  Literally.
[01:41:11.551 --> 01:41:11.771]  Exactly.
[01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:15.313]  I've had people get up and apologize to the audience for their involvement in what they're doing.
[01:41:16.644 --> 01:41:17.484]  And see, that's the key.
[01:41:17.544 --> 01:41:19.025]  The truth is powerful.
[01:41:19.605 --> 01:41:21.106]  If we're able to... Exactly.
[01:41:21.206 --> 01:41:23.427]  I mean, look, all the liberals I know are buying guns.
[01:41:23.787 --> 01:41:25.708]  They realize the environmental movements are fraud.
[01:41:25.748 --> 01:41:26.888]  They still are environmentalists.
[01:41:26.908 --> 01:41:28.389]  They're just really environmentalists.
[01:41:28.789 --> 01:41:31.110]  I mean, none of us want to drink dirty water and air, folks.
[01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:33.711]  But they don't... They've got to understand.
[01:41:33.771 --> 01:41:35.192]  It is diabolical!
[01:41:35.892 --> 01:41:38.493]  I mean, I know the ranchers and farmers that have their land stolen.
[01:41:38.893 --> 01:41:40.434]  Then they build shopping malls on it.
[01:41:40.734 --> 01:41:42.635]  It has nothing to do with the environment!
[01:41:42.655 --> 01:41:45.136]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:41:45.455 --> 01:41:48.857]  It has nothing to do with the quality of life, even though they'll tell you that.
[01:41:49.318 --> 01:41:52.700]  It's all a sham, it's all fraud, in order to take your land.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:42:09.050]  And of course, the Kelo decision a year and a half ago, back in June of 2005, has just opened the doors to the floodgates of communities, these local governments, basically condemning land for ten cents on the dollar, and taking it for development of another private enterprise.
[01:42:09.111 --> 01:42:14.154]  Well, we're going to go to Vietnam and take a call here in a moment, but I want to tell a story about local environmentalists who save our springs.
[01:42:15.316 --> 01:42:24.545]  Back in the early nineties when they were going to steal all this property, these guys were on TV, radio, they were worshipped, they were heroes, and then now you want to see them, they've grabbed all the land.
[01:42:24.585 --> 01:42:31.552]  They'll go protest now when they build a shopping mall or luxury million-dollar homes on it, but now the news won't cover them and now they get it.
[01:42:31.852 --> 01:42:36.897]  See, they were used, they also used the locals to give it the illusion that it's grassroots.
[01:42:37.677 --> 01:42:40.460]  Yes, in fact that is the primary thing right there is that
[01:42:40.891 --> 01:42:43.053]  The whole environmental movement is being used.
[01:42:43.493 --> 01:42:47.936]  Once they have what they want, the local environmental leaders and so forth, they'll be out in their ears.
[01:42:49.397 --> 01:42:50.998]  They can care less about the environment.
[01:42:51.419 --> 01:42:54.481]  Well, you know, the biggest landowner in the United States is the Sierra Club.
[01:42:55.301 --> 01:42:55.762]  Yes.
[01:42:56.222 --> 01:42:57.203]  No, Nature Conservancy.
[01:42:57.283 --> 01:42:58.564]  Excuse me, I always get the two mixed up.
[01:42:58.584 --> 01:43:00.125]  That's right, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club.
[01:43:00.145 --> 01:43:00.545]  Excuse me.
[01:43:01.266 --> 01:43:02.166]  That's the order, correct?
[01:43:02.907 --> 01:43:03.748]  Yes.
[01:43:03.768 --> 01:43:08.371]  So the Nature Conservancy, I mean, they're a mafia.
[01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:09.732]  It's just incredible.
[01:43:11.167 --> 01:43:11.808]  It really is.
[01:43:11.968 --> 01:43:13.290]  They started out on a good premise.
[01:43:13.771 --> 01:43:23.604]  If you want it, you should buy it, but at the same time now they've got their power and they're using the government basically as, like you say, a mafia and a poor landowner whose land they want.
[01:43:23.704 --> 01:43:24.866]  They don't have a chance.
[01:43:25.788 --> 01:43:40.198]  So how it works is, and by the way, all the big real estate councils of the country are for it, and it's not because they love the birdies or the snails or the worms or the spiders or the cave bugs that have caused the building to stop around here in many areas.
[01:43:40.558 --> 01:43:50.645]  It lays off whole corridors and then instantly jacks up their prices, and then everybody forgets, on average, after five years, then they end up going in and sweetheart deals with the government
[01:43:51.045 --> 01:43:56.890]  The county-city government that now controls it, and then they're giving the land for almost nothing, then the restrictions are taken off!
[01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:58.912]  I mean, they ought to all be arrested!
[01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:02.295]  They really ought to, because it is extortion.
[01:44:02.575 --> 01:44:06.359]  It's about every crime in the book, except it's the government, and they can get away with it.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.541]  Absolutely.
[01:44:08.661 --> 01:44:10.082]  Is our caller from Vietnam still there?
[01:44:11.163 --> 01:44:12.464]  Beyond, thank you for holding.
[01:44:12.484 --> 01:44:14.766]  I appreciate your call from all the way from Vietnam.
[01:44:14.826 --> 01:44:16.988]  Bush is there, I guess, or was there.
[01:44:17.028 --> 01:44:17.769]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:44:21.061 --> 01:44:21.721]  Hello, caller?
[01:44:26.304 --> 01:44:27.504]  Sounds like his phone may have broken.
[01:44:27.524 --> 01:44:28.085]  Put him back on hold.
[01:44:28.125 --> 01:44:29.285]  I've never gotten a call from Vietnam.
[01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:33.127]  I want to see if he's able to be there in a moment, or he might have stepped away from his computer.
[01:44:33.787 --> 01:44:36.689]  We're going to go back to your calls in a few minutes, folks, but I do want to talk to Bjorn.
[01:44:37.489 --> 01:44:39.890]  Talk to him, John, until he gets back on the line.
[01:44:40.331 --> 01:44:44.173]  I've gotten a call from Antarctica, McMurtle Air Station, weather station.
[01:44:44.213 --> 01:44:48.835]  I've gotten calls from Japan and everywhere else, but I haven't gotten one from Vietnam yet.
[01:44:49.955 --> 01:44:53.197]  Dr. Colvin, let's just briefly, because I know we're running low on time, I want to take some calls.
[01:44:53.677 --> 01:45:00.520]  What are the different power blocks, according to your research, inside this New World Order?
[01:45:01.421 --> 01:45:09.104]  Well, the first one is the Anglo-American faction that was described by Carol Quigley in his 1966 book, The Tragedy and Hope.
[01:45:09.585 --> 01:45:16.088]  That is the all-powerful entity made up basically of the financial institutions of the United States and Great Britain.
[01:45:16.108 --> 01:45:17.048]  The Anglo-American.
[01:45:17.749 --> 01:45:18.609]  The Anglo-American.
[01:45:19.199 --> 01:45:20.880]  Uh, they have the greatest amount of power.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:23.882]  They're involved in every aspect of our lives and you don't even know it.
[01:45:24.082 --> 01:45:29.646]  They basically control the political process, the judicial process, the educational process here in this country.
[01:45:29.666 --> 01:45:31.807]  And that's why we're in the problems that we are right now.
[01:45:32.267 --> 01:45:34.849]  Then you have the socialist European faction.
[01:45:35.307 --> 01:45:38.508]  Which is vying for power with the Anglo-American faction.
[01:45:38.668 --> 01:45:39.928]  It's led by France and Germany.
[01:45:40.288 --> 01:45:45.970]  Ever wonder why France and Germany never seem to support us on these international ventures that England always is there?
[01:45:46.330 --> 01:45:47.030]  Well, that's why.
[01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:49.131]  And I explain that in the DVD.
[01:45:49.531 --> 01:45:50.251]  And go on and on.
[01:45:50.271 --> 01:45:54.652]  You have the U.S.S.R., the former U.S.S.R., the Soviet Union, the Soviet bloc.
[01:45:55.213 --> 01:45:56.573]  I shouldn't say the Soviet Union.
[01:45:57.133 --> 01:45:58.113]  The Russian Federation.
[01:45:58.133 --> 01:46:01.794]  And by the way, they put the hammers and sickles back on and now call themselves that again.
[01:46:01.815 --> 01:46:03.475]  And the general public doesn't even know it.
[01:46:04.065 --> 01:46:06.167]  Yeah, nothing's really changed.
[01:46:06.187 --> 01:46:14.154]  They're going back to what they had before, but they're still trying to gain power so that they have a niche in this, if not come out of the dominant partner.
[01:46:14.694 --> 01:46:15.555]  And so is China.
[01:46:15.735 --> 01:46:17.356]  China is another major one.
[01:46:17.416 --> 01:46:26.124]  If you wonder why all these things, and they're all the time, you never see it in the local newspaper, the evening news or anything, there's all these tensions going on underneath the scenes.
[01:46:26.144 --> 01:46:30.848]  They're trying to undercut us, or us them, at every step of the way.
[01:46:31.548 --> 01:46:31.809]  And it's
[01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:34.551]  A tension that will never go away.
[01:46:34.591 --> 01:46:39.052]  We're going to have a world government sooner or later, as far as they're concerned, and they want to be on top.
[01:46:39.492 --> 01:46:45.694]  And finally, the Arab League itself, or the radical Islamists, are another one.
[01:46:46.095 --> 01:46:52.317]  They're being used by the Muslims in general, or the Arabs in general, as a front.
[01:46:52.357 --> 01:46:54.217]  They're being funded by this, as you well know.
[01:46:54.257 --> 01:46:58.899]  They're being funded by the Saudi families and the rich, oil-rich Arab nations.
[01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:04.574]  In order to destabilize the West and create a niche for themselves.
[01:47:04.614 --> 01:47:08.596]  They want to dominate the world just as much as the Anglo-American factor.
[01:47:08.616 --> 01:47:13.537]  But the Anglo-Americans helped set up a lot of those countries in the 1915 and 1925.
[01:47:14.018 --> 01:47:18.259]  And so from my research, there's a major connection.
[01:47:18.319 --> 01:47:20.220]  Also, they're involved in the secret societies.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.802]  Uh, and the Knights Templar, so I see a big connection.
[01:47:23.842 --> 01:47:30.486]  I see the Anglo-American, the European faction, and the Arab faction, even though it doesn't look like that on the surface, a lot of undercurrent connections.
[01:47:31.247 --> 01:47:31.867]  Yes, there are.
[01:47:31.947 --> 01:47:37.050]  In fact, obviously, we set the whole thing up, the CIA set up Al-Qaeda, and all the rest.
[01:47:37.090 --> 01:47:44.155]  The tensions that we're facing right now, the terrorisms that we are facing right now, were created by the CIA, as you have talked about on your program.
[01:47:45.654 --> 01:47:52.579]  Once you begin to understand this whole process, it all starts to make sense as to why all these very strange things happen.
[01:47:54.119 --> 01:47:55.399]  How long do you think until they start?
[01:47:55.439 --> 01:47:59.021]  Because I know the North American Union, they're already operating under SPP.
[01:47:59.701 --> 01:48:04.122]  They announced two weeks ago that the Asian Union had been in effect for a decade, but they publicly announced it.
[01:48:04.142 --> 01:48:04.983]  That was in Reuters.
[01:48:05.863 --> 01:48:15.186]  And now, through the North American Union, they're already making treaties with the EU, so they're really already connecting to each other, and we're already really going into a trilateral world government.
[01:48:16.206 --> 01:48:16.686]  Absolutely.
[01:48:16.706 --> 01:48:18.307]  There's no question that they're
[01:48:19.008 --> 01:48:21.030]  There's no intention of them failing in this.
[01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:30.999]  This has been one of the goals of the Trilateral Commission right from its inception in 1973, is to create a North American Union, as well as others.
[01:48:31.279 --> 01:48:38.085]  They've wanted to divide this whole world up into economic units since the 1970s, early 1970s.
[01:48:38.125 --> 01:48:39.186]  So has the Club of Rome.
[01:48:39.827 --> 01:48:42.269]  They even published a map back in 1973 showing ten financial kingdoms.
[01:48:46.329 --> 01:48:49.430]  And that's what the Trilateral Commission is also doing.
[01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:57.813]  I'll explain all this in the DVD, showing how they have actually intended to do this for over 30 years now.
[01:48:58.634 --> 01:49:00.534]  This is nothing new.
[01:49:00.914 --> 01:49:02.395]  They've been planning this for a long time.
[01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:11.918]  And of course, for years, if you even mention the Club of Rome or the Trilateral Commission or something, people will look at you like you're from Mars, because everybody knew back in the 1970s and early 1980s
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:15.081]  That those organizations didn't.
[01:49:15.161 --> 01:49:16.442]  It was all conspiracy stories.
[01:49:16.462 --> 01:49:17.102]  Are you kidding?
[01:49:17.202 --> 01:49:23.447]  I remember in 2000, the New York Times said I was a made-up Bilderberg.
[01:49:24.267 --> 01:49:24.547]  Yeah.
[01:49:25.368 --> 01:49:26.749]  I mean, they were still doing it then.
[01:49:26.769 --> 01:49:27.549]  You're right, Doctor.
[01:49:28.450 --> 01:49:28.670]  Yeah.
[01:49:29.391 --> 01:49:31.712]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[01:49:32.153 --> 01:49:33.954]  Remember when it didn't exist, folks?
[01:49:34.514 --> 01:49:36.215]  The North American Union didn't exist?
[01:49:37.036 --> 01:49:38.517]  Let's talk about their plans to kill us.
[01:49:39.304 --> 01:49:42.225]  Let me get back, because that is the final plan of old Beelzebub, isn't it?
[01:49:43.406 --> 01:49:45.746]  And we'll take your calls, I promise, on the other side.
[01:49:46.187 --> 01:49:46.907]  Stay with us.
[01:49:47.067 --> 01:49:55.390]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:57.691]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:58.071 --> 01:50:05.674]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:06.403 --> 01:50:13.448]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:13.849 --> 01:50:16.791]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:19.473]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:20.774]  NSA spies.
[01:50:21.235 --> 01:50:25.276]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.576 --> 01:50:29.097]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:29.537 --> 01:50:31.458]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:31.798 --> 01:50:35.719]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:04.050 --> 01:53:05.611]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:05.651 --> 01:53:07.772]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:53:07.792 --> 01:53:13.255]  I'm going to keep Dr. Michael Coughlin with us a little bit into the next hour.
[01:53:13.295 --> 01:53:24.661]  And we've got Mayor Pro Tem coming on from Farmer's Branch up in Dallas, my old stomping grounds, where they're standing up against the open borders invasion.
[01:53:26.051 --> 01:53:44.857]  But just in a nutshell, Doctor, please break down for us, I mean obviously the population reduction agenda that Dr. Bianca has been calling for, the 80-90% they publicly state, can you give us your analysis of that and when in the global government plan they'll start to fully implement that?
[01:53:44.897 --> 01:53:52.499]  I mean we know they're doing it in China now and doing it through abortion and other things, but how are they going to really get the huge population reduction they say they're going to implement?
[01:53:53.385 --> 01:53:54.286]  Well, there's two things.
[01:53:54.666 --> 01:54:07.952]  One of the things that we tumbled onto when we stopped the Biodiversity Treaty from being ratified 12, 13 years ago was the fact that they call for a human population of no more than 1 to 2 billion people on planet Earth.
[01:54:07.992 --> 01:54:12.155]  That's a two-thirds to three-quarter reduction of the planetary population.
[01:54:12.295 --> 01:54:14.816]  And they say, ideally, ideally 500 million, though.
[01:54:15.356 --> 01:54:20.639]  Yeah, ideally it's 500 million, but they wanted to get down, they needed, within 50 years, to 1 to 2 billion.
[01:54:21.324 --> 01:54:45.371]  And the way that they were planning on doing that, according to their own words, is that they wanted to make the environment so critically important that we could no longer use pesticides, we could no longer use herbicides and so forth in growing food, and food production would be cut by about one-half to two-thirds, and of course you know what happens if you don't have any food to eat, you normally will expire within two weeks.
[01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:48.492]  Well, it's like how they banned DDT that really wasn't hurting the birds.
[01:54:48.552 --> 01:54:50.193]  That kills tens of millions a year.
[01:54:50.993 --> 01:54:52.114]  Yes.
[01:54:52.154 --> 01:54:54.815]  Now, Dr. Coffman, let me comment on this, because this is really important.
[01:54:54.835 --> 01:54:55.375]  Let's be clear.
[01:54:55.956 --> 01:55:00.458]  They're not talking about advances in food production, or good genetic engineering, or any of these things.
[01:55:00.538 --> 01:55:07.621]  They're going from the point of view that man's the problem and must be gotten rid of, not even thinking about what developments there'll be in the next 50 years.
[01:55:07.942 --> 01:55:12.984]  Plus, the very people running this don't care about the environment, and they're doing everything they can to really destroy it.
[01:55:13.664 --> 01:55:16.626]  So what is the driving force behind this psychopathic behavior?
[01:55:17.606 --> 01:55:19.768]  I think the desire for control, power.
[01:55:20.489 --> 01:55:23.672]  You can say money, but they've already got all the money they could ever possibly use.
[01:55:23.792 --> 01:55:27.716]  Money is only a means to an end, and that is power.
[01:55:27.956 --> 01:55:28.436]  Well, that's right.
[01:55:28.456 --> 01:55:32.580]  People always say they don't want to kill us.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.501]  They need the money.
[01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:35.003]  Folks, they print the money.
[01:55:35.603 --> 01:55:36.864]  The money is the way to control us.
[01:55:36.904 --> 01:55:37.425]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.382]  And that's the key thing that we have to recognize.
[01:55:40.402 --> 01:55:44.125]  They're not like you and I, who are really trying to get money just to survive.
[01:55:44.565 --> 01:55:46.706]  They have more money than they could possibly use.
[01:55:47.147 --> 01:55:49.509]  They do use their money to gain more and more power.
[01:55:49.569 --> 01:55:50.669]  They want to be in control.
[01:55:50.749 --> 01:55:53.852]  It's an age-old desire, even of Satan himself.
[01:55:53.912 --> 01:55:55.053]  He wants to be in control.
[01:55:55.433 --> 01:56:02.878]  And they want to have us at a subsistence level, because then we're totally desperate and under their control, which is feudalism.
[01:56:03.139 --> 01:56:04.760]  So, hence, it's neo-feudalism.
[01:56:05.459 --> 01:56:09.181]  In fact, in the Global Biodiversity Assessment that we gave the U.S.
[01:56:09.221 --> 01:56:17.266]  Senate to stop the Biodiversity Treaty, we highlighted one of the sections which basically said they wanted to re-establish the old feudal system of the Dark Ages.
[01:56:17.647 --> 01:56:26.792]  In fact, I used that subsection of the Biodiversity Assessment at the end of Road to Tyranny, where it says, they talk about how wonderful human sacrifice is.
[01:56:27.313 --> 01:56:27.533]  Yes.
[01:56:28.744 --> 01:56:29.265]  Absolutely.
[01:56:29.725 --> 01:56:39.112]  And of course, the whole concept of Mother Earth religion, or this pantheistic type of religion, almost always inevitably leads to human sacrifice.
[01:56:39.752 --> 01:56:40.352]  Almost always.
[01:56:40.372 --> 01:56:43.435]  It wouldn't be in this generation, of course, but it would certainly be in the next generation.
[01:56:44.035 --> 01:56:46.157]  Dr. Goldman, what are you doing in the next hour?
[01:56:46.217 --> 01:56:53.902]  I've got a mayor coming on from Farmer's Branch, but I'm only going to have him about 10 minutes, and this is so important.
[01:56:56.824 --> 01:56:58.704]  Forty-five minutes just blew past us.
[01:57:00.065 --> 01:57:00.365]  I know.
[01:57:00.445 --> 01:57:03.705]  Unfortunately, we were about to take off to go to my son's house for Thanksgiving.
[01:57:03.946 --> 01:57:04.666]  Well, do that.
[01:57:04.726 --> 01:57:12.327]  Let's do five more minutes on the other side and blitz through Jeff, Bill, and Nick's calls at least, maybe even Brian, and then we'll have to get you back up soon, sir.
[01:57:13.167 --> 01:57:13.688]  Absolutely.
[01:57:13.748 --> 01:57:14.728]  I really enjoyed this.
[01:57:15.068 --> 01:57:16.668]  Well, we're going to be back in 60 seconds.
[01:57:17.088 --> 01:57:24.130]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, we've got the video, World Events and Prophecy, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:25.070]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:29.065 --> 01:57:34.147]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:34.167 --> 01:57:34.647]  Big Brother.
[01:57:34.827 --> 01:57:35.688]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:35.728 --> 01:57:36.828]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:36.848 --> 01:57:42.010]  You want answers?
[01:57:42.511 --> 01:57:44.251]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.328 --> 01:57:56.929]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.509 --> 01:58:01.611]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.872 --> 01:58:05.412]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:05.472 --> 01:58:09.033]  We are now into our number three.
[01:58:09.093 --> 01:58:10.374]  Let's go to Jeff in New York.
[01:58:10.454 --> 01:58:11.934]  You're on the air with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[01:58:11.954 --> 01:58:13.435]  Thank you for holding your real trooper.
[01:58:13.455 --> 01:58:14.135]  What's on your mind?
[01:58:14.675 --> 01:58:15.135]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:15.275 --> 01:58:17.576]  This is Jeff that sent you the 522 Mason footage.
[01:58:17.616 --> 01:58:19.037]  That's right.
[01:58:19.057 --> 01:58:22.538]  The Masons let you in and let you videotape all their bizarreness out there.
[01:58:22.578 --> 01:58:22.758]  Yes.
[01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:25.920]  Yeah, um, I wanted to give a program announcement.
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:31.890]  My public access show, Expose and Defeat Tyranny, is airing now in the town that I filmed that in.
[01:58:32.395 --> 01:58:36.058]  And next week I'll be showing that episode on the show in the town of Littleton.
[01:58:37.019 --> 01:58:37.559]  What was that?
[01:58:37.679 --> 01:58:38.100]  Lodge 533?
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:38.100]  522.
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:42.263]  522.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:42.263]  That's the one.
[01:58:42.323 --> 01:58:43.984]  My hometown of Skinny Atlas, New York.
[01:58:44.205 --> 01:58:44.985]  Well, good job.
[01:58:45.005 --> 01:58:47.367]  What do you think of what Dr. Michael Kaufman is talking about?
[01:58:47.387 --> 01:58:54.373]  It's the stuff you've been talking about, Alex, and I see the Masons must be involved in this too, in this World Relief Act thing.
[01:58:54.393 --> 01:58:59.257]  On my DVD I spend about 15, well about 10 minutes on Masonry.
[01:59:00.037 --> 01:59:11.705]  Well, let me just tell listeners, anybody who has access to TV shows in the country, if it's pretty good, I'll put it on PrisonPlanet.tv where a lot of people can see it and folks can grab it off that and put it on Google.
[01:59:12.066 --> 01:59:20.872]  So send me your TV show, Jeff, and I'll, not just with the video you shot, but I'll put your, because I know your work's really good, send me your access TV show, I'll put it on the web.
[01:59:21.132 --> 01:59:22.393]  Great, I was going to suggest that.
[01:59:22.433 --> 01:59:27.437]  I have an intro that I made up with black helicopter footage and local politicians from the state.
[01:59:28.237 --> 01:59:30.479]  Bill and Hillary Clinton that I met a couple years back.
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:36.684]  I have some George Bush at Puppet, a parody TV commercial that I do.
[01:59:36.704 --> 01:59:38.786]  I'd like to send you those too, maybe you'll get a kick out of it.
[01:59:38.806 --> 01:59:43.630]  No, no, no, yeah, that's what we're trying to expand, you know, help everybody get their information out.
[01:59:44.171 --> 01:59:44.371]  Great.
[01:59:44.731 --> 01:59:53.279]  I have a clip from a local news show the other day where Walmart had taken off their shelves a Skull & Bones t-shirt because it looked
[01:59:53.908 --> 01:59:55.770]  Just exactly like the Nazi Civil War.
[01:59:55.810 --> 01:59:57.491]  I was wondering if you want me to send you that, too.
[01:59:57.531 --> 01:59:58.892]  I could play you the clip right now if you want.
[01:59:58.912 --> 01:59:59.032]  Sure.
[01:59:59.573 --> 02:00:02.095]  No, I mean, I know skull and bones are in style right now.
[02:00:02.115 --> 02:00:03.956]  I was at Target and there were like five shirts.
[02:00:03.976 --> 02:00:05.638]  I was trying to buy some shirts, t-shirts.
[02:00:05.658 --> 02:00:06.879]  They all had skulls on them.
[02:00:07.479 --> 02:00:08.380]  So I was having trouble.
[02:00:09.241 --> 02:00:11.743]  I mean, there's just the worship of death is everywhere.
[02:00:11.843 --> 02:00:14.145]  Aren't they inculcating this into us, Dr. Kaufman?
[02:00:14.565 --> 02:00:15.486]  Yes, they absolutely are.
[02:00:15.526 --> 02:00:16.767]  That's part of this whole religion.
[02:00:19.209 --> 02:00:20.690]  One aspect of it is death.
[02:00:22.294 --> 02:00:31.699]  That's in, we talk about that in some of the symbolism on the Ark of the Covenant, or Ark of the Hope, that was sent to the United Nations in Johannesburg in 2002.
[02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:33.980]  Amazing.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:36.201]  Hey Jeff, it's good hearing from you, brother.
[02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:37.461]  Good to hear from you, Alex.
[02:00:37.802 --> 02:00:38.782]  Yeah, and call back another time.
[02:00:38.802 --> 02:00:39.782]  I don't have all these guests on.
[02:00:39.822 --> 02:00:40.903]  I'd like to talk to you some more.
[02:00:41.443 --> 02:00:42.724]  Let's talk to Bill in Iowa.
[02:00:42.764 --> 02:00:43.624]  Bill, thanks for holding.
[02:00:43.644 --> 02:00:44.125]  Go ahead.
[02:00:45.125 --> 02:00:45.825]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:46.266]  Hi.
[02:00:46.286 --> 02:00:48.967]  I owe you a deep apology.
[02:00:49.027 --> 02:00:49.927]  Do you remember me?
[02:00:50.888 --> 02:00:51.328]  No, I don't.
[02:00:52.487 --> 02:00:55.670]  I was the one that called about election voting.
[02:00:58.051 --> 02:00:58.832]  And what were you saying?
[02:00:58.872 --> 02:00:59.432]  I don't remember.
[02:01:00.733 --> 02:01:02.235]  That doesn't matter.
[02:01:02.615 --> 02:01:03.696]  You disagreed with me.
[02:01:03.796 --> 02:01:06.077]  So, anyway, hello to your guest.
[02:01:06.298 --> 02:01:07.498]  Well, I mean, what did we disagree about?
[02:01:07.519 --> 02:01:08.639]  So I turned out being right?
[02:01:10.741 --> 02:01:11.562]  Yes, you did.
[02:01:11.582 --> 02:01:15.665]  I challenged you on whether or not you voted or not.
[02:01:15.845 --> 02:01:16.525]  Oh, I remember.
[02:01:16.565 --> 02:01:17.226]  Yes, yes.
[02:01:17.706 --> 02:01:19.848]  I owe you a deep
[02:01:20.816 --> 02:01:22.537]  Sincere apology for that.
[02:01:22.777 --> 02:01:23.597]  Well, don't worry about it.
[02:01:24.158 --> 02:01:25.378]  Do you have a quick question for our guest?
[02:01:27.719 --> 02:01:40.926]  Not really for your guest, but I just got Terror Storm, well, one of the several copies that I had, and the Freedom to Fascism movie.
[02:01:41.026 --> 02:01:42.387]  I just came in yesterday.
[02:01:42.407 --> 02:01:44.408]  Wow, that blew me away.
[02:01:49.022 --> 02:01:53.584]  I was hoping that I could talk to you without a guest being on, but anyway... Well, you know, I'll put you back on hold.
[02:01:53.624 --> 02:01:55.786]  I'll get to you a little bit later if you'll just keep holding.
[02:01:56.466 --> 02:01:58.227]  We're out of time, and I know we've got a lot of phone lines.
[02:01:58.247 --> 02:01:59.347]  We're going to get to everybody's calls.
[02:01:59.647 --> 02:02:06.471]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is going to head off now to start Thanksgiving to go be with his family, and I'll be talking to him when he gets back from Thanksgiving.
[02:02:06.491 --> 02:02:13.775]  I think we're going to have him come to town, and we'll probably have him in studio here and interview him for the upcoming film.
[02:02:14.495 --> 02:02:16.256]  Doctor, why don't you fire out your website, too?
[02:02:17.239 --> 02:02:20.581]  It's www.discerningtoday.org.
[02:02:21.041 --> 02:02:22.741]  Discerningtoday.org.
[02:02:22.842 --> 02:02:26.703]  That's D-I-S-C-E-R-N-I-N-G today.org.
[02:02:26.963 --> 02:02:28.884]  We didn't even scratch the service.
[02:02:28.904 --> 02:02:30.525]  I've got to have you back on in the near future.
[02:02:30.885 --> 02:02:32.386]  God bless you, my friend, and be safe.
[02:02:32.966 --> 02:02:33.606]  Well, thank you.
[02:02:34.006 --> 02:02:34.447]  Take care.
[02:02:34.807 --> 02:02:36.648]  We'll come right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:36.688 --> 02:02:37.188]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.184 --> 02:02:49.649]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:50.010 --> 02:02:57.637]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:58.351 --> 02:03:05.415]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:05.795 --> 02:03:17.201]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.541 --> 02:03:21.103]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.504 --> 02:03:23.445]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.765 --> 02:03:27.607]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:40.928 --> 02:03:41.669]  Terrorism!
[02:03:41.829 --> 02:03:42.569]  Terrorism!
[02:03:42.689 --> 02:03:48.733]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:49.013 --> 02:03:50.615]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:50.855 --> 02:03:53.316]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:53.717 --> 02:04:08.286]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:08.326 --> 02:04:08.647]  government.
[02:04:08.827 --> 02:04:10.608]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:10.988 --> 02:04:16.892]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:17.032 --> 02:04:21.555]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:40.273 --> 02:04:45.057]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:49.260]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:55.824]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:04:56.065 --> 02:05:00.448]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[02:05:06.192 --> 02:05:11.695]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[02:05:11.876 --> 02:05:19.620]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.

[02:05:41.817 --> 02:05:44.018]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:44.038 --> 02:05:47.441]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:49.022 --> 02:05:49.743]  I'm not liberal.
[02:05:50.984 --> 02:05:51.925]  I'm not conservative.
[02:05:51.945 --> 02:05:53.226]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[02:05:53.246 --> 02:05:57.129]  I stand with the Bill of Rights and the Constitution with
[02:05:58.303 --> 02:06:00.085]  The bedrock of what this country stands for.
[02:06:00.105 --> 02:06:01.727]  I don't think that's a radical stance.
[02:06:02.027 --> 02:06:03.288]  I know it's a popular stance.
[02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:08.293]  But the politicians are bought and paid for by big multinational corporations and they're killing this country.
[02:06:09.314 --> 02:06:20.386]  And the Associated Press reported two days ago that 50 plus major lending institutions give preferential treatment to illegal aliens and do not even ask for their social security number.
[02:06:21.221 --> 02:06:29.126]  I've already knew this from people working in banking and people working managing apartment complexes, but now we have the proof right out in the open.
[02:06:29.166 --> 02:06:32.268]  Now that is discrimination, that is racketeering, because it's illegal.
[02:06:32.408 --> 02:06:38.953]  It's an organized operation trying to allow an illegal practice to continue.
[02:06:38.993 --> 02:06:41.334]  That is definition organized crime.
[02:06:42.115 --> 02:06:43.295]  But they do it right out in the open.
[02:06:44.436 --> 02:06:48.779]  And a large portion of the illegal aliens say that this country belongs to Mexico,
[02:06:49.981 --> 02:06:56.544]  And the town of El Cenizo, the San Antonio Express News reported, does not allow anything but Spanish to be spoken in court proceedings.
[02:06:56.984 --> 02:06:57.964]  It is Spanish only.
[02:06:58.885 --> 02:07:00.666]  You go down to Mexico, it's Spanish only.
[02:07:01.946 --> 02:07:06.568]  And you go down to Mexico and you're an illegal alien, they'll put you in a jail and extort all the money out of your family.
[02:07:06.768 --> 02:07:07.369]  They're tough!
[02:07:08.389 --> 02:07:10.930]  We got 30 million illegals here, not 14 million.
[02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:11.790]  Those are the real numbers.
[02:07:12.111 --> 02:07:17.613]  You look at the Census Department numbers, and I've had Congressman Tom Tancredo on and Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul to tell you that.
[02:07:18.928 --> 02:07:19.869]  This is the reality.
[02:07:20.329 --> 02:07:24.673]  They've had a few towns that have tried to tell their police to arrest illegal aliens, to stop them.
[02:07:24.913 --> 02:07:25.834]  I mean, I know police.
[02:07:25.874 --> 02:07:27.595]  They're told to let them go and they don't have insurance.
[02:07:29.657 --> 02:07:33.300]  Vicente Fox was up here in Austin two years ago.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.001]  He's not present anymore, but he was.
[02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:36.802]  We have video of it.
[02:07:37.043 --> 02:07:41.186]  He gave an award to the police department for not following the law and making this a haven city.
[02:07:42.087 --> 02:07:47.451]  Then he gave an award to Wells Fargo for issuing them debit cards with no ID that are then used to get homes.
[02:07:49.312 --> 02:07:53.934]  Now, this is because the establishment wants to bust up this country, as Lou Dobbs has reported.
[02:07:54.314 --> 02:07:57.295]  It's the North American Union, and it's make it or break it time.
[02:07:57.675 --> 02:07:58.055]  Okay?
[02:07:58.416 --> 02:08:02.297]  Now, some little towns haven't done this right, and the ACLU swooped in on them, a bunch of crooks.
[02:08:02.917 --> 02:08:06.119]  Again, on one issue they'll be right, on ten others they'll be wrong.
[02:08:06.939 --> 02:08:11.981]  And they'll try to sue and stop it, but it's called illegal alien for a reason.
[02:08:12.021 --> 02:08:12.961]  These people are criminals.
[02:08:15.102 --> 02:08:17.083]  And a lot of them are involved in other crimes.
[02:08:18.502 --> 02:08:27.185]  And so we have got Mayor Deputy Pro Tem on with us, and we are really honored to have Tim O'Hare.
[02:08:27.825 --> 02:08:31.786]  He's from Farmer's Branch, that's up in Dallas-Fort Worth area, where I come from.
[02:08:32.386 --> 02:08:36.027]  And here's the Associated Press article, KXAN also did a story here locally.
[02:08:36.387 --> 02:08:44.550]  Immigration issues coming up in the legislature, and it talks about Farmer's Branch is telling illegal immigrants they can't live in a Dallas suburb, they can still work there though.
[02:08:45.541 --> 02:08:49.624]  City Council members and Farmers Branch passed a controversial immigration resolution late Monday night.
[02:08:49.944 --> 02:08:53.407]  Now, they said that to make it sound discriminatory or hypocritical.
[02:08:53.847 --> 02:08:58.430]  Actually, they passed resolutions saying you better not be illegal working there, and that's federal law!
[02:09:00.111 --> 02:09:07.356]  Okay, I mean, I know when I've had jobs at Walmart when I was in college or at a golf course, I had to show all my ID and all my stuff, and the illegals didn't.
[02:09:07.576 --> 02:09:08.277]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:09:08.297 --> 02:09:08.957]  Let's go to him.
[02:09:09.358 --> 02:09:11.239]  Enough of my setup of this.
[02:09:12.197 --> 02:09:14.138]  And there's a lot of disinfo out there.
[02:09:14.218 --> 02:09:16.698]  Here it is from the man himself, who is an attorney as well.
[02:09:17.198 --> 02:09:19.219]  And again, we salute him, Tim O'Hare.
[02:09:19.519 --> 02:09:21.320]  Thank you for coming on, Mayor Pro Tem.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:23.440]  Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:26.661]  It doesn't appear like you are fired up about this issue at all.
[02:09:27.101 --> 02:09:28.562]  Well, I mean, I love America.
[02:09:28.842 --> 02:09:39.385]  I'm one of those people who gets a tear in their eye at the football game when they say the national anthem, and I'm mad.
[02:09:41.124 --> 02:09:41.564]  Well, you know what?
[02:09:41.604 --> 02:09:42.484]  More power to you.
[02:09:42.644 --> 02:09:51.246]  And it's guys like you all across the country that are helping councils and states to pass these measures when the federal government won't.
[02:09:51.266 --> 02:09:52.727]  So we appreciate what you're doing.
[02:09:53.227 --> 02:09:54.267]  Well, we appreciate you.
[02:09:54.287 --> 02:09:56.067]  Now, you guys have got your act together.
[02:09:56.587 --> 02:09:57.468]  I hope they don't beat you.
[02:09:57.488 --> 02:09:58.328]  We were talking during the break.
[02:09:58.348 --> 02:09:59.848]  You said you guys are going to stay the course.
[02:10:01.389 --> 02:10:04.509]  Break down what the city council really did and why you did it.
[02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:06.530]  We basically did three things.
[02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:07.650]  We passed
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:11.761]  A resolution that's named English as the official language of the city.
[02:10:11.941 --> 02:10:17.263]  And that part of it is largely symbolic, but it did two other things that I thought were pretty important.
[02:10:17.443 --> 02:10:23.766]  One, it said the city's not going to print materials or post signage in any language other than English from this point forward.
[02:10:23.866 --> 02:10:24.326]  I love it!
[02:10:24.686 --> 02:10:35.810]  And the second thing that it did, which was my favorite part of the whole deal, if you seek employment with the City of Farmers Branch, you cannot be denied, now that we've passed that resolution,
[02:10:36.255 --> 02:10:38.857]  On the basis that the only language you speak is English.
[02:10:39.938 --> 02:10:43.921]  And I think that is long overdue because we are seeing people all across the metroplex.
[02:10:44.597 --> 02:10:46.818]  Lose jobs because they're not bilingual.
[02:10:46.978 --> 02:10:49.539]  And I don't think that's fair and I don't think that's the way this country should be.
[02:10:49.819 --> 02:10:56.642]  By the way, I have a lot of friends in California and in Dallas, but big cities is my point, master chefs.
[02:10:57.643 --> 02:11:04.365]  And all the restaurants have been taken over by legal aliens from Mexico and they finally just tell you, get out of here!
[02:11:04.766 --> 02:11:06.766]  We don't want you here if you don't speak Spanish.
[02:11:07.207 --> 02:11:11.388]  And a lot of jobs out there tell people, no, if you're not bilingual, no job.
[02:11:11.688 --> 02:11:12.929]  And that is discriminatory.
[02:11:13.789 --> 02:11:14.650]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:16.190]  We passed two other measures.
[02:11:17.171 --> 02:11:37.540]  One of them was to send our police officers to receive 287G training, which if your listeners are not aware what that is, it's basically the federal government offers state and local law enforcement officials the opportunity to be trained essentially to act as ICE agents and conduct themselves with regards to illegals as ICE agents.
[02:11:37.581 --> 02:11:38.321]  So we authorized that.
[02:11:38.361 --> 02:11:40.482]  And then the third thing we did was
[02:11:41.847 --> 02:11:47.051]  Agreed to fine landlords who rent to people who are living in apartment complexes.
[02:11:47.111 --> 02:11:47.791]  That's the key.
[02:11:48.492 --> 02:11:49.192]  That's a big one.
[02:11:49.312 --> 02:11:55.516]  And we've had, like you said, they put in the paper that we didn't do the business deal.
[02:11:55.556 --> 02:11:57.458]  We didn't fine businesses who employ them.
[02:11:58.498 --> 02:12:00.940]  And what I would say about this, we haven't done it yet.
[02:12:02.717 --> 02:12:08.680]  Our goal is to keep illegal aliens out of Farmer's Branch and to make Farmer's Branch unattractive to them.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:09.261]  Exactly!
[02:12:09.301 --> 02:12:11.902]  You're taking four big bites right now.
[02:12:11.922 --> 02:12:15.164]  I mean, you're eating like a hundred ounce T-bone right now.
[02:12:15.184 --> 02:12:18.746]  Yeah, well we think the three things we did are going to help us achieve that goal.
[02:12:18.766 --> 02:12:22.167]  But if they don't, then you better believe businesses are next.
[02:12:22.287 --> 02:12:29.371]  And you know, that's just that the three things we passed were the easiest things to do, that require the least amount of money from the city,
[02:12:29.998 --> 02:12:32.060]  And if we have to go after businesses, we'll do that next.
[02:12:32.301 --> 02:12:34.963]  Now, Farmers Branch is a big town in the metroplex.
[02:12:35.284 --> 02:12:35.904]  How many people?
[02:12:36.445 --> 02:12:40.389]  Yeah, we only have 28,000 people, but we are right on the border of Dallas.
[02:12:40.569 --> 02:12:42.731]  I mean, we're known as a first-ring suburb.
[02:12:44.073 --> 02:12:48.858]  Exactly, and I'm just outraged by the fact that
[02:12:50.326 --> 02:12:56.572]  That the illegals flaunt the law in 800 plus cities or sanctuary cities where the law isn't even enforced.
[02:12:56.612 --> 02:13:05.019]  Now, the ACLU and others are already squealing, but they don't really have any recourse, do they?
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.441]  What are they saying they're going to do?
[02:13:07.041 --> 02:13:15.789]  Well, they're going to file lawsuits claiming that local law enforcement and municipalities are not allowed to enforce these measures.
[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:29.246]  And I'll tell you, the case law doesn't support what their arguments are, and what you hear from a lot of these groups, they can't argue the issues on the merits, they can't argue the fact that people are breaking the law, so they just resort to a bunch of name-calling.
[02:13:30.126 --> 02:13:37.169]  The good news is, in our city, it seems like from some informal polling that has been done,
[02:13:37.865 --> 02:13:44.487]  And just from the emails, faxes, and phone calls that I've received, it seems like about 90% of the people in our city support these measures.
[02:13:44.787 --> 02:13:45.427]  Now, you just said 90.
[02:13:45.567 --> 02:13:48.668]  I never talked to you before we just got on air, and that's what I say every day.
[02:13:48.908 --> 02:13:51.929]  But the Gallup poll last year said 90%.
[02:13:51.969 --> 02:13:54.090]  The Gallup poll this year said 91%.
[02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:55.831]  That's the number.
[02:13:55.911 --> 02:13:56.051]  It's 90%.
[02:13:56.351 --> 02:14:03.913]  Yeah, and you know, we have people arguing with us that we... Well, the way we did it was a bunch of volunteers put door hangers
[02:14:04.449 --> 02:14:08.671]  on pretty much every single door in the city of Farmer's Branch and said, give us your responses.
[02:14:09.372 --> 02:14:16.356]  We've had over a thousand responses come back and those responses have been 90% in favor of it.
[02:14:16.796 --> 02:14:20.398]  Man, I wish we had a government in Austin like yours where the city asks what we want!
[02:14:21.339 --> 02:14:24.801]  And this wasn't officially done by the city, it was done by citizens.
[02:14:24.941 --> 02:14:27.162]  No, I understand, but still, the city's listening to that.
[02:14:27.582 --> 02:14:34.006]  Yeah, and the support has just been universal and you would be shocked to come look at my email
[02:14:34.582 --> 02:14:40.565]  list of just the emails I've received from not just Farmers Branch and Metroplex residents, but from people all over the country.
[02:14:40.865 --> 02:14:42.085]  The support is overwhelming.
[02:14:42.165 --> 02:14:58.633]  Well, 67 to 70 percent of Hispanics, and again that's almost all of the citizens, they also poll the quote immigrants, I mean, so if you look, if you break down those polls, the Gallup poll, almost 80 percent of Hispanics who are citizens, it's right at 80,
[02:15:00.313 --> 02:15:04.756]  When you take the illegals out of the equation, are against it too, so it's not some racial issue.
[02:15:05.036 --> 02:15:15.543]  This is America, and we simply cannot take the hordes of people from Latin America or anywhere else for that matter, and we certainly can't have illegals running around all over the place.
[02:15:15.563 --> 02:15:29.151]  You know, our proposals will benefit every single person that lives in Farmers Branch, Texas, regardless of what race, color, or creed they are, with the exception of people who aren't supposed to be here in the first place.
[02:15:29.762 --> 02:15:30.303]  Exactly.
[02:15:30.363 --> 02:15:33.185]  Now, do you have copies of the resolutions you passed?
[02:15:33.245 --> 02:15:37.448]  I mean, are other cities looking at duplicating what you've done, or are they waiting to see what happens?
[02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:52.681]  Well, you have a lot of wait and see, but I've been in touch with four different city officials from different cities in Texas, and I will tell you that the momentum is growing just almost on a daily basis.
[02:15:53.766 --> 02:15:58.027]  Now, I have a few friends that are police officers, and sheriffs have complained on the air.
[02:15:58.807 --> 02:16:03.088]  We've had them on from Tennessean places, where they'll pick up a whole car full of ten illegals.
[02:16:03.848 --> 02:16:05.668]  They'll even find drugs on them, things like that.
[02:16:05.708 --> 02:16:08.169]  They take them, and the feds won't even come get them or deport them.
[02:16:08.449 --> 02:16:09.509]  They have to let them go.
[02:16:10.649 --> 02:16:18.451]  It's illegals are involved in a lot higher incidents of wrecks because of the drinking, and because they've never really had any driver education.
[02:16:19.111 --> 02:16:25.396]  So right there, how can a city like Austin catch and release, but then a city like Farmers Branch do its job?
[02:16:25.516 --> 02:16:28.659]  I don't know how cities don't get sued for not doing their job.
[02:16:28.839 --> 02:16:30.180]  You know, that's a good point.
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:46.933]  Alex, I handle injury and death cases at my law firm, and I will tell you, not a day goes by that we don't get a phone call from someone who said they were in a wreck, and they're hurt, and they were hit by someone who was here illegally that doesn't have insurance.
[02:16:46.993 --> 02:16:47.894]  Not a day goes by.
[02:16:48.621 --> 02:16:50.962]  Well, I've been hit personally twice by illegals.
[02:16:52.082 --> 02:17:00.584]  And it's not just a matter of benefiting our city and raising property values and helping the schools, but it's also a safety issue.
[02:17:00.604 --> 02:17:06.646]  You know, there's so many good, positive reasons to do this, and it really is.
[02:17:07.126 --> 02:17:08.426]  It's protecting America.
[02:17:09.626 --> 02:17:10.687]  It's just common sense!
[02:17:10.727 --> 02:17:11.667]  We have to do this!
[02:17:11.987 --> 02:17:14.648]  Well, you know, you're not allowed to have common sense in politics.
[02:17:14.668 --> 02:17:15.628]  That's just not allowed.
[02:17:17.029 --> 02:17:22.794]  I know you're very busy, sir, but I'd like to do five minutes with you on the other side, a quick break, and then five minutes on the other side.
[02:17:22.814 --> 02:17:23.534]  Are you game to do that?
[02:17:23.795 --> 02:17:24.235]  No problem.
[02:17:24.415 --> 02:17:25.396]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:17:25.436 --> 02:17:28.018]  We'll be right back with Tim O'Hare.
[02:17:28.579 --> 02:17:29.679]  He's from Farmers Branch.
[02:17:29.699 --> 02:17:30.700]  He's a city councilman.
[02:17:46.606 --> 02:17:47.827]  Currency devaluation.
[02:17:48.147 --> 02:17:48.707]  Inflation.
[02:17:49.188 --> 02:17:49.888]  One and the same.
[02:17:50.608 --> 02:17:54.591]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:00.856 --> 02:18:03.977]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:04.237 --> 02:18:06.058]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:06.158 --> 02:18:09.139]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:18:09.699 --> 02:18:11.920]  Here is reality.
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:15.882]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:18:16.362 --> 02:18:20.023]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:18:20.584 --> 02:18:23.064]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:18:24.764 --> 02:18:28.468]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[02:18:41.624 --> 02:18:44.165]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:44.666 --> 02:18:49.408]  Did you know there is a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:55.931]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:18:56.591 --> 02:18:56.912]  I think so.
[02:19:13.131 --> 02:19:13.271]  516-8736.
[02:19:13.451 --> 02:19:14.132]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:19:41.445 --> 02:19:45.008]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:19:45.048 --> 02:19:45.569]  are located?
[02:19:45.769 --> 02:19:49.171]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:19:49.392 --> 02:19:54.096]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[02:19:59.680 --> 02:19:59.980]  I think so.
[02:20:19.056 --> 02:20:19.336]  I think so.
[02:20:42.446 --> 02:20:47.887]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:20:48.307 --> 02:20:53.048]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:20:53.448 --> 02:20:56.069]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:20:56.549 --> 02:20:59.970]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:21:00.730 --> 02:21:05.071]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:21:05.511 --> 02:21:08.691]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:21:09.291 --> 02:21:12.132]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:15.051]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:21:15.091 --> 02:21:16.871]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:21:17.071 --> 02:21:17.131]  U.S.

[02:21:20.512 --> 02:21:21.272]  Ask for George.
[02:21:58.830 --> 02:22:00.690]  Welcome back, final segment with our guest.
[02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:03.591]  We'll open the phones up and cover a bunch of news in the last 30 minutes.
[02:22:04.051 --> 02:22:13.832]  Here at the bottom of the hour, Tim O'Hare is a native Texan, also of course a former UT football player, and he is an attorney up in Farmer's Branch also.
[02:22:13.872 --> 02:22:17.033]  He is the deputy mayor pro tem, city council member,
[02:22:17.888 --> 02:22:25.072]  And they've simply said that they're going to do the opposite of what other cities do, saying they're going to be sanctuaries and violate federal and state law.
[02:22:25.552 --> 02:22:27.253]  They're going to try to basically enforce the law.
[02:22:27.673 --> 02:22:30.214]  You know, cities don't have to even pass laws like you've done.
[02:22:30.594 --> 02:22:40.099]  When they pull an illegal over and they don't have insurance, I mean, they arrest citizens all the time for not having insurance, driving recklessly, not having their driver's license, but they don't do that to illegals.
[02:22:41.048 --> 02:22:48.611]  How do these other cities get to the point of basically making the illegal aliens first-class citizens and then citizens are second-class?
[02:22:49.871 --> 02:22:56.794]  I'll tell you what you have, Alex, is you have people in political office who so desperately want to hold on to their jobs.
[02:22:56.874 --> 02:23:06.837]  And when I say what I'm about to say, it's not that I don't love Farmer's Branch or like what I'm doing, but if I get defeated in a re-election bid, I mean, really, who cares?
[02:23:07.037 --> 02:23:09.298]  I mean, it's City Council and Farmer's Branch.
[02:23:09.938 --> 02:23:16.901]  I don't have to try to make sure that I'm politically correct, and I don't have to try to make sure that I don't upset one particular group or another.
[02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:18.502]  Well, that's because you're not sucking off things.
[02:23:18.542 --> 02:23:22.563]  A lot of people are sucking off the government trough, and so they do want to stay in, too.
[02:23:22.603 --> 02:23:23.884]  So you're not sucking anything.
[02:23:23.904 --> 02:23:27.185]  That's always a key indicator that you're not toeing the line.
[02:23:27.565 --> 02:23:31.147]  That's exactly right, and then my supporters are not big businesses.
[02:23:31.867 --> 02:23:33.988]  Exactly, and I've said it over and over again.
[02:23:50.791 --> 02:23:57.814]  We get 60%, 55% turnout depending on the national election, but then we get on average in Texas 8% turnout.
[02:23:58.095 --> 02:24:06.159]  The power is at the county and city and municipal level and this is where the people can actually get into power and can actually turn the tide.
[02:24:06.939 --> 02:24:09.920]  I think it's almost a distraction to focus too much on the federal level.
[02:24:11.021 --> 02:24:19.225]  Well, what we've seen in Farmer's Branch is more people have spoken out and gotten involved as a result of this issue
[02:24:19.778 --> 02:24:23.941]  Than we have ever seen in the history of our city.
[02:24:24.121 --> 02:24:28.885]  And it has inspired people to get involved at the local government level.
[02:24:29.385 --> 02:24:36.431]  And it's just a storm, really, that is sweeping across the country of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
[02:24:36.451 --> 02:24:47.880]  You know, mayor of one of the largest suburbs in our area, Plano, which you're familiar with, had a quote in the paper on Tuesday that said, I'm getting a lot of phone calls saying, why can't you be like Tim O'Hare?
[02:24:48.810 --> 02:24:54.575]  And I say that because when one city passes these measures, other people say, hey, finally someone with the courage to do it.
[02:24:54.615 --> 02:24:57.237]  Yeah, it shows change can really happen, and it's constitutional.
[02:24:57.257 --> 02:25:01.720]  Yeah, and they go ask people, yeah, they go ask people and say, hey, we want you to do it, and that's how another city is going to do it.
[02:25:02.701 --> 02:25:03.481]  Well, exactly.
[02:25:03.542 --> 02:25:08.005]  Instead of the 867, last time I checked, that are sanctuary cities.
[02:25:09.066 --> 02:25:11.488]  Now, this had to be triggered by something.
[02:25:12.623 --> 02:25:19.926]  I mean, was this triggered by a massive influx of illegal aliens or was it just informed citizens there in Farmer's Branch?
[02:25:20.407 --> 02:25:22.648]  You know, I would say really it was a combination of things.
[02:25:22.728 --> 02:25:31.152]  It was a combination of just what's going on in the nation, a combination of that along with seeing what a couple of other cities were doing.
[02:25:32.072 --> 02:25:34.473]  Yes, we've seen a large influx in our city.
[02:25:34.653 --> 02:25:40.116]  We've seen property values on the decline or appreciating at a very low rate.
[02:25:40.697 --> 02:25:43.898]  You know, we've seen the reputation of our school district suffer somewhat.
[02:25:43.958 --> 02:25:47.319]  So, it was just a deal where a lot of things happened.
[02:25:47.359 --> 02:25:51.660]  And we also had a two-year-old little girl killed in a drive-by shooting earlier this year.
[02:25:52.300 --> 02:25:55.641]  And the two people that were arrested, the two suspects, were illegal.
[02:25:55.861 --> 02:25:58.322]  And, you know, finally people have to say, enough is enough.
[02:25:58.342 --> 02:25:59.082]  Well, that's it.
[02:25:59.222 --> 02:26:00.763]  Statistically, exactly.
[02:26:01.023 --> 02:26:03.444]  It's not that Mexicans in Mexico are all criminals.
[02:26:03.824 --> 02:26:07.545]  It's that those that come here have a higher level of criminality already.
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:15.025]  And so, there are already criminals to be here to begin with, and I mean, what is it, almost half of LA jails are illegal aliens?
[02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:25.934]  I mean... Yeah, I've seen, what is it, 95% of the warrants in LA County for murder are for illegals, and 75% of the people on the most wanted list are illegals.
[02:26:25.994 --> 02:26:29.677]  I mean, anybody that thinks that's not coming to their city is just blind.
[02:26:30.578 --> 02:26:35.742]  In fact, Dallas had some Los Zetas murders last year where their military drug dealers were killing people.
[02:26:37.258 --> 02:26:49.107]  It's a problem that you're seeing all across the country, and I would tell people to take a look at the statistics in Los Angeles County, and ask yourself, is this what you want our city or our county to look like?
[02:26:49.207 --> 02:26:50.328]  And no one wants that.
[02:26:50.368 --> 02:26:51.969]  That's why these measures are necessary.
[02:26:51.989 --> 02:26:54.731]  They also tell blacks, whites, and Asians, you can't work here.
[02:26:57.313 --> 02:27:05.099]  What this is really doing, is it is suppressing all this huge influx of illegals, is suppressing wages for lower income Americans.
[02:27:05.706 --> 02:27:08.447]  Well, uh, just, we've got about 20 seconds left.
[02:27:08.527 --> 02:27:10.807]  You off the top of your head know the Farmers Branch website?
[02:27:11.888 --> 02:27:18.690]  www.farmersbranch.info, but the best place to go is www.supportfarmersbranch.com.
[02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:21.390]  Ah, supportfarmersbranch.com.
[02:27:22.031 --> 02:27:23.431]  Uh, Councilman, thank you, sir.
[02:27:24.451 --> 02:27:25.051]  Hey, my pleasure.
[02:27:25.071 --> 02:27:25.932]  I'll be on any time, Alex.
[02:27:26.092 --> 02:27:26.312]  You bet.
[02:27:26.332 --> 02:27:27.132]  We'll be praying for you.
[02:27:27.172 --> 02:27:27.532]  Take care.
[02:27:31.293 --> 02:27:32.253]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.273 --> 02:27:34.174]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.209 --> 02:27:37.950]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:41.171 --> 02:27:44.773]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:27:45.013 --> 02:27:45.853]  Look no further!
[02:27:46.173 --> 02:27:48.734]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:27:49.175 --> 02:27:57.598]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:27:57.978 --> 02:27:58.178]  I think so.
[02:28:15.433 --> 02:28:15.673]  I'm good.
[02:28:42.478 --> 02:28:43.499]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:46.623]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:28:46.883 --> 02:28:51.048]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:28:51.468 --> 02:28:52.309]  So what do you do?
[02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:57.195]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:28:57.675 --> 02:28:59.797]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:29:00.277 --> 02:29:14.986]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:29:40.851 --> 02:29:41.391]  Hey Emily!
[02:29:41.671 --> 02:29:42.572]  Wow, you look great!
[02:29:42.932 --> 02:29:43.732]  I feel great!
[02:29:43.972 --> 02:29:45.913]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:29:46.274 --> 02:29:46.574]  Really?
[02:29:46.834 --> 02:29:47.214]  What is it?
[02:29:47.374 --> 02:29:47.814]  How does it work?
[02:29:47.954 --> 02:29:54.397]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[02:29:54.517 --> 02:29:56.778]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:29:56.959 --> 02:30:02.081]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you!
[02:30:02.401 --> 02:30:02.862]  That's it?
[02:30:03.102 --> 02:30:04.703]  That sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:30:04.903 --> 02:30:05.604]  It is easy.
[02:30:05.804 --> 02:30:12.450]  Plus, the FDA says Flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:30:12.730 --> 02:30:14.071]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:30:14.272 --> 02:30:15.052]  That's amazing!
[02:30:15.373 --> 02:30:20.737]  And, the Benzonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:30:20.977 --> 02:30:21.298]  Wow!
[02:30:21.478 --> 02:30:22.539]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[02:30:22.979 --> 02:30:26.002]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[02:30:55.527 --> 02:30:56.107]  Welcome back!
[02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:23.990]  Yep.
[02:31:24.551 --> 02:31:25.692]  It ain't no Senator's son.
[02:31:27.053 --> 02:31:30.175]  Alright, we've got our caller from Vietnam back.
[02:31:30.215 --> 02:31:31.816]  I believe it's Vian or Vian.
[02:31:31.836 --> 02:31:33.258]  I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.
[02:31:33.598 --> 02:31:34.218]  From Vietnam.
[02:31:34.258 --> 02:31:36.000]  Let's go right to you then, Bill, Rusty and others.
[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:37.621]  Welcome from Vietnam.
[02:31:37.661 --> 02:31:38.281]  Can you hear me?
[02:31:38.882 --> 02:31:39.963]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:31:40.023 --> 02:31:40.643]  Can you hear me?
[02:31:41.084 --> 02:31:41.564]  Yes, sir.
[02:31:41.644 --> 02:31:43.105]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[02:31:43.125 --> 02:31:44.206]  Where are you in Vietnam?
[02:31:45.287 --> 02:31:46.228]  Ah, Saigon.
[02:31:46.508 --> 02:31:48.169]  I've been here six years.
[02:31:49.430 --> 02:31:50.451]  Where are you originally from?
[02:31:50.471 --> 02:31:51.692]  Norway.
[02:31:52.575 --> 02:31:53.895]  Oh, wow, so you're there on business?
[02:31:55.316 --> 02:31:56.096]  Teaching English.
[02:31:57.076 --> 02:31:59.576]  All right, so what are you calling about today, sir?
[02:32:01.016 --> 02:32:06.197]  Okay, first I want to say I consider you my brother.
[02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:13.539]  I follow you almost every day, and you have my full respect and blessings.
[02:32:13.819 --> 02:32:14.859]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:32:14.879 --> 02:32:15.619]  God bless you.
[02:32:17.199 --> 02:32:21.000]  Okay, first, a piece of news, and then a question for you.
[02:32:22.166 --> 02:32:26.549]  Guess who's here in Vietnam training Vietnamese soldiers?
[02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:28.690]  Our military!
[02:32:29.551 --> 02:32:29.791]  Yes.
[02:32:31.412 --> 02:32:37.696]  About two years ago on the BBC, you know, I was very perplexed to see the Prime Minister.
[02:32:37.896 --> 02:32:46.441]  He made an announcement that he had a plan to get American military instructors over to Vietnam to train the Vietnamese military.
[02:32:47.341 --> 02:32:52.424]  The arch enemy, USA, would come over to Vietnam to train the Vietnamese soldiers.
[02:32:52.464 --> 02:32:57.207]  No, I saw that a few years ago and frankly didn't even cover it because I didn't think the listeners could handle it or believe it.
[02:32:57.688 --> 02:33:00.589]  That kind of stuff, it's all so insane.
[02:33:01.390 --> 02:33:07.954]  And then I tell it to a friend of mine and he said, yeah, didn't you know that they've been here one year already?
[02:33:08.997 --> 02:33:09.177]  Really?
[02:33:09.257 --> 02:33:13.782]  I saw a plan a couple years ago to part of Clinton.
[02:33:13.842 --> 02:33:19.087]  Clinton opened up relations six years ago, but they'd really been operating before that.
[02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:23.952]  But I don't know what the Vietnamese would need advice on.
[02:33:24.053 --> 02:33:27.276]  It seems they know what they're doing when it comes to guerrilla warfare.
[02:33:27.296 --> 02:33:31.100]  I guess it shows the long arm of the new world order.
[02:33:33.334 --> 02:33:39.159]  Yeah, Ho Chi Minh's gone now, so the New World Order takes over one way or the other, huh?
[02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:42.182]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:33:42.302 --> 02:33:54.112]  And now Vietnam is becoming capitalist, you know, because about 1991 they realized that they were running out of money, and so they had to liberalize the economy.
[02:33:54.553 --> 02:33:57.015]  They've got lots of Nike plants now.
[02:33:57.876 --> 02:33:58.696]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:34:00.232 --> 02:34:03.935]  And, well, it's awfully, awfully, awfully corrupted.
[02:34:04.516 --> 02:34:08.238]  The rich are getting richer, and the poor, they stay poor.
[02:34:09.439 --> 02:34:10.120]  That's the deal.
[02:34:10.961 --> 02:34:20.608]  I want to ask you, well, with your intelligence on these matters, what do you predict is the future for Southeast Asia?
[02:34:20.868 --> 02:34:23.730]  Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand?
[02:34:24.631 --> 02:34:29.635]  It's going to turn into a total police state, even to a greater extent, until the police state's in place.
[02:34:30.313 --> 02:34:37.115]  And then there will be really bizarre super viruses that pop up and start reducing the population over the next decade.
[02:34:37.475 --> 02:34:39.716]  Just like we'll see that in Africa already happening.
[02:34:40.096 --> 02:34:44.698]  What, 35% of the continent has AIDS or illnesses that mimic it.
[02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:51.475]  And that there's just going to be big global slave plantations just like China, just like the U.S.
[02:34:51.535 --> 02:34:51.975]  is going to be.
[02:34:52.015 --> 02:34:59.261]  I mean, it's all the same programs, the same names, the same systems, all owned by the big central banks.
[02:34:59.321 --> 02:35:00.943]  I mean, what do you see happening?
[02:35:00.963 --> 02:35:01.503]  You're there.
[02:35:01.523 --> 02:35:03.244]  I bet you know more about it than I do.
[02:35:04.045 --> 02:35:13.773]  Well, you can say with Vietnam, the worst thing is at the same time the best thing, and that is the corruption.
[02:35:14.844 --> 02:35:22.828]  That is, it's very, very corrupted, so you can never trust the government, you can never trust a police officer.
[02:35:23.248 --> 02:35:37.115]  At the same time, if some police officer, he gets a directive from a superior to do something, well, he might not just do it, if he doesn't want to.
[02:35:38.112 --> 02:35:41.315]  Well, that's the thing about balance.
[02:35:41.715 --> 02:35:44.717]  The old joke is, in Mexico, at least you know, you just pay the bribe.
[02:35:44.757 --> 02:35:48.540]  And folks, I've been in Mexico and had the cop pull me over.
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:50.381]  I've actually been in a car while it happens.
[02:35:50.762 --> 02:35:53.444]  And then the driver just gives them 20 bucks and it's no problem.
[02:35:54.284 --> 02:35:55.485]  That's just how they operate.
[02:35:55.846 --> 02:36:01.230]  Here, it's more sophisticated because they keep the corruption at the low level only in certain areas.
[02:36:01.930 --> 02:36:05.874]  And then basically have a bunch of well-meaning idiots carrying out the operation.
[02:36:05.914 --> 02:36:10.899]  So yeah, really corrupt societies in their final phases start falling apart.
[02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:15.023]  And that's why the globalists are trying to quote, root out corruption worldwide.
[02:36:15.083 --> 02:36:18.026]  By that they mean just put in their type of corruption.
[02:36:18.854 --> 02:36:20.155]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:36:20.176 --> 02:36:32.129]  I don't know how you can microchip 80 million Vietnamese, I mean, running around everywhere and they are not registered and the government, they don't know where the hell they are and
[02:36:33.606 --> 02:36:36.608]  I think it's sort of just too chaotic here.
[02:36:36.708 --> 02:36:45.051]  Sure, it's going to be the first world countries where they go, you don't have to have the chip, but if you want the free health care, you've got to have it.
[02:36:45.431 --> 02:36:56.656]  Or if you want that tax exemption for your children, or if you want to drive a car, or if you want to prove you're a trusted, like Andy Rooney said on 60 Minutes, we all need to take chips to prove we're the good people.
[02:36:57.436 --> 02:37:00.138]  Or what Sean Hannity said, every child needs a chip.
[02:37:00.198 --> 02:37:00.838]  I have him on video.
[02:37:02.218 --> 02:37:03.820]  No, I don't know about Vietnam.
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:14.467]  I think the best thing they could do here would just be to put a neutron bomb on us and just exterminate all of us or something like that.
[02:37:14.487 --> 02:37:24.775]  I think it will be very hard to organize this society that is just so extremely disorganized.
[02:37:25.157 --> 02:37:32.802]  Well, a neutron bomb, as you know, folks, doesn't create a heat wave that is destroying life by fire.
[02:37:33.303 --> 02:37:42.229]  It sends out a powerful pulse of intense radiation, killing all life, depending on how powerful it is a hundred feet under the ground.
[02:37:43.656 --> 02:37:45.617]  But I don't think they'll use neutron bombs.
[02:37:45.637 --> 02:37:49.581]  When they start calling us, it'll be wave after wave of buyer releases.
[02:37:49.641 --> 02:37:55.125]  Every few years, it'll be the shadowy terror group, Chaos, that's doing it.
[02:37:55.806 --> 02:38:01.431]  There'll be little video recordings that Chaos, or whatever name they give it, will announce on television.
[02:38:02.772 --> 02:38:07.436]  But don't worry, the global government is fighting and routing out Chaos.
[02:38:08.232 --> 02:38:10.875]  Oh, we defeated chaos forces in this country.
[02:38:11.095 --> 02:38:12.976]  Oh, we defeated them in that country.
[02:38:13.016 --> 02:38:15.439]  I mean, that's really the program plan.
[02:38:15.879 --> 02:38:17.060]  And so that's what I see happening.
[02:38:17.801 --> 02:38:23.386]  Well, listen, I really appreciate you coming on the show and I'll call back again.
[02:38:24.527 --> 02:38:25.367]  OK, thanks.
[02:38:26.048 --> 02:38:26.528]  Thank you.
[02:38:27.569 --> 02:38:30.792]  Callers all over the globe call from Vietnam.
[02:38:31.012 --> 02:38:33.054]  Let's talk to Brian in New Jersey.
[02:38:33.074 --> 02:38:34.535]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:38:34.575 --> 02:38:35.016]  Go ahead.
[02:38:40.109 --> 02:38:42.391]  Okay, Bill in Iowa, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:43.191 --> 02:38:44.772]  Hello, Alex, again.
[02:38:45.232 --> 02:38:47.974]  That's right, earlier you wanted to make a comment, we ran out of time, go ahead.
[02:38:48.194 --> 02:38:50.676]  Yeah, thank you for holding me over.
[02:38:51.797 --> 02:39:01.603]  The guy that called earlier basically answered my question to you about what can we do.
[02:39:02.023 --> 02:39:02.403]  Okay.
[02:39:03.944 --> 02:39:06.506]  Do I have a few minutes or do I have to rush?
[02:39:06.726 --> 02:39:07.567]  No, just go ahead, sir.
[02:39:08.147 --> 02:39:08.467]  Thank you.
[02:39:09.861 --> 02:39:15.843]  Do you know that we have five social classes in this country?
[02:39:18.184 --> 02:39:18.524]  Okay.
[02:39:19.384 --> 02:39:30.288]  Okay, we have the rich, we have the upper middle class, the middle class, the lower middle class, and the poor.
[02:39:31.168 --> 02:39:33.389]  Well, I would say there's about ten groups.
[02:39:34.119 --> 02:39:55.835]  You've got the lower lower class, the lower working class, the higher level blue collar, the lower middle class, the middle class, the upper middle class, the nouveau riche, the wealthy, the super wealthy, the ultra-rich, the elite, and then the money printers.
[02:39:58.397 --> 02:40:00.759]  Okay, well the money printers are the
[02:40:01.536 --> 02:40:03.557]  People that we are fighting against.
[02:40:03.697 --> 02:40:09.860]  But anyway, um, yes, I, okay, we, we g-haul there.
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:10.460]  Okay.
[02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:13.041]  Pardon my Southern expression.
[02:40:13.781 --> 02:40:28.808]  Um, my point is, I'm, I just got the, uh, another cop, I got the terror storm and the, uh, freedom to fascism.
[02:40:29.088 --> 02:40:29.408]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:30.905 --> 02:40:37.711]  Just came in yesterday, ordered it three weeks ago, and man, I watched that Freedom to Fascism.
[02:40:38.372 --> 02:40:40.614]  It just totally blew me away.
[02:40:40.694 --> 02:40:43.837]  Yeah, and let me just add something about shipping here.
[02:40:43.877 --> 02:40:47.320]  People always ask, hey, one time I ordered and I got it in three days.
[02:40:48.001 --> 02:40:49.823]  Another time I ordered and it took three weeks.
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:56.682]  What happens is, we got Freedom to Fascism in, and then of course, then it sells out, then you've got to get more in.
[02:40:57.082 --> 02:41:00.984]  So sometimes, you know, it'll take a while if something becomes backordered.
[02:41:02.064 --> 02:41:04.885]  But right now, we are not backordered on anything.
[02:41:05.485 --> 02:41:06.866]  We were backordered on t-shirts.
[02:41:06.886 --> 02:41:07.926]  Those just came in.
[02:41:08.386 --> 02:41:10.707]  So that's why it took you three weeks to get it.
[02:41:10.747 --> 02:41:14.688]  But again, we're not Amazon.com, but they don't have Freedom to Fascism.
[02:41:14.728 --> 02:41:16.509]  We're a small operation.
[02:41:16.549 --> 02:41:17.609]  We try best we can.
[02:41:17.929 --> 02:41:19.490]  But thank you for getting the film, sir.
[02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:20.711]  No problem.
[02:41:20.871 --> 02:41:29.896]  I have several of your documentaries and I've had to wait just about every time and I was always glad to get them.
[02:41:30.476 --> 02:41:31.677]  And I'll share them with others.
[02:41:33.218 --> 02:41:44.825]  But anyway, the thing is here, my point is, like the previous caller asked you, what can we do?
[02:41:45.505 --> 02:41:47.186]  What are we going to do about this, man?
[02:41:50.573 --> 02:41:51.134]  Here's the deal.
[02:41:51.634 --> 02:41:52.856]  It's like the Twilight Zone.
[02:41:53.456 --> 02:41:54.217]  Where was I?
[02:41:54.277 --> 02:42:01.925]  I was looking at people just the other day and I was on an escalator.
[02:42:01.945 --> 02:42:02.786]  I guess I was at the mall.
[02:42:02.806 --> 02:42:03.066]  That's right.
[02:42:03.086 --> 02:42:04.007]  I went to the Apple Store.
[02:42:04.928 --> 02:42:11.535]  My wife was in another store doing something and I was standing there with my son holding his hand and I was just looking at people.
[02:42:12.504 --> 02:42:20.827]  And they just look so into themselves and happy or sad or posing or, you know, striking a pose, what people do.
[02:42:21.747 --> 02:42:32.752]  And I just wanted to warn them, I wanted to start shouting, hey, there's a global government, there's criminals in control, they're incrementally destroying our freedom, they have very bad plans for you, they've devalued your dollar!
[02:42:33.692 --> 02:42:35.953]  But they've been conditioned that that would be crazy.
[02:42:35.993 --> 02:42:39.374]  Now, sometimes I get the urge when my family isn't with me, I will do it, I have done it.
[02:42:39.841 --> 02:42:41.542]  Or I'll walk over to a crowd of people.
[02:42:41.562 --> 02:42:43.242]  People have seen me in America before by design.
[02:42:44.042 --> 02:42:45.063]  Walk into a big crowd.
[02:42:45.083 --> 02:42:45.943]  In fact, I'm going to do that.
[02:42:45.963 --> 02:42:48.323]  I'm going to, for the new film making, I'm going to go out and do some of that.
[02:42:49.304 --> 02:42:52.725]  Just to start, you know, yelling in crowds and warning people.
[02:42:53.725 --> 02:42:55.225]  And really, that's the instinct.
[02:42:55.245 --> 02:42:56.886]  We have to get through the comfort zone.
[02:42:58.026 --> 02:42:59.187]  If we love these people.
[02:42:59.207 --> 02:43:01.047]  I mean, don't we all have that drive?
[02:43:01.067 --> 02:43:01.967]  I mean, I know I have it.
[02:43:02.287 --> 02:43:03.588]  I want to warn people, man.
[02:43:03.628 --> 02:43:04.408]  I want to tell them.
[02:43:04.728 --> 02:43:07.869]  That's an instinct, you know, that goes back to coming back to the cave and going,
[02:43:08.911 --> 02:43:10.653]  There's a big cave bear coming this way.
[02:43:11.054 --> 02:43:14.459]  Let's get ready and ambush it.
[02:43:14.659 --> 02:43:16.061]  That's what our ancestors would do.
[02:43:16.121 --> 02:43:20.086]  Get up above it on the cliff side with big old boulders and heave them down on the cave bear.
[02:43:20.126 --> 02:43:23.952]  That's why we extincted them in northern and western Europe.
[02:43:24.512 --> 02:43:28.515]  I'm kind of digressing into anthropology, but I've got that instinct.
[02:43:28.576 --> 02:43:30.397]  I saw a big cave bear down by the brook.
[02:43:30.717 --> 02:43:37.443]  It's coming this way, and I run in and go, ooka, ooka, ooka, ooka, and I want to ooka, ooka, ooka, uba, juba, juba.
[02:43:37.943 --> 02:43:39.644]  I want to run around doing that everywhere.
[02:43:39.684 --> 02:43:40.685]  I want to run down.
[02:43:40.725 --> 02:43:41.286]  I've done it, too.
[02:43:41.326 --> 02:43:42.146]  Sometimes I have the urge.
[02:43:42.166 --> 02:43:45.449]  I just walk outside in front of the office, and I go, world government's here.
[02:43:46.350 --> 02:43:48.692]  Google Operation Northwoods.
[02:43:50.022 --> 02:43:51.303]  Sometimes I see cameras.
[02:43:51.343 --> 02:43:53.864]  I want to get out of my car and bash them with a baseball bat.
[02:43:53.884 --> 02:43:54.584]  I haven't done that.
[02:43:54.604 --> 02:43:56.045]  I have to control the urge.
[02:43:56.405 --> 02:44:00.306]  I want to, like, go get spray paint at StencilInfoWars.com on every bridge.
[02:44:00.727 --> 02:44:02.027]  I want to do... I can't do it all.
[02:44:02.387 --> 02:44:02.667]  You know?
[02:44:03.028 --> 02:44:04.468]  I mean, I want to warn people.
[02:44:04.688 --> 02:44:06.429]  Hey, man, don't take the vaccines.
[02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:07.109]  They're deadly!
[02:44:08.010 --> 02:44:09.610]  So really, it's warning people.
[02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:10.991]  They don't know yet.
[02:44:11.831 --> 02:44:17.934]  And so... And, you know, a guy called earlier and said, well, we're preaching to the choir here.
[02:44:18.914 --> 02:44:22.076]  You know, what are we doing here on air?
[02:44:22.416 --> 02:44:26.399]  We need to, you know, go to... I don't think he said go to war, but he said we need to do something now.
[02:44:27.439 --> 02:44:32.182]  And so many of the people on the web and other places that are calling for violence, I'm not saying he was, but others are.
[02:44:32.202 --> 02:44:36.605]  I mean, if you really start calling for violence, folks, you get arrested if you're not a fed.
[02:44:37.566 --> 02:44:45.031]  And every time I've researched the people calling for violence, that is on an organized platform, using their name, that's not really their name A,
[02:44:46.169 --> 02:44:51.311]  And then B, and it's normally both of them, they are there trying to provocateur others.
[02:44:51.851 --> 02:44:56.673]  They didn't hurt the New World Order if somebody was to go into a police station and shoot 20 cops.
[02:44:57.213 --> 02:44:58.574]  Most of those cops are good people.
[02:44:59.154 --> 02:44:59.954]  They're ignorant.
[02:45:00.294 --> 02:45:01.875]  They've been given bad programs.
[02:45:01.895 --> 02:45:03.336]  They've been given bad information.
[02:45:03.756 --> 02:45:04.776]  They're malfunctioning.
[02:45:04.816 --> 02:45:05.557]  They don't know.
[02:45:06.177 --> 02:45:08.938]  It would do nothing to blow up every federal building in the country.
[02:45:08.958 --> 02:45:10.058]  The globalists would love it.
[02:45:10.358 --> 02:45:11.759]  They're going to call in foreign troops.
[02:45:12.834 --> 02:45:15.375]  The Globalists plan to have a big civil war here, by the way.
[02:45:15.395 --> 02:45:19.536]  They're going to do stuff so bad, we're going to be forced to defend ourselves, and that's the way it is.
[02:45:20.236 --> 02:45:23.177]  And they're going to love the first wave of our own police and military.
[02:45:23.197 --> 02:45:24.157]  They're going to get shot up.
[02:45:24.397 --> 02:45:25.417]  They're going to get routed.
[02:45:25.797 --> 02:45:26.197]  Boom!
[02:45:26.878 --> 02:45:27.798]  And they may do this.
[02:45:28.278 --> 02:45:30.778]  They could have the illegals riot and bring in foreign troops.
[02:45:31.039 --> 02:45:33.179]  They could have a civil war and bring in foreign troops.
[02:45:33.459 --> 02:45:34.639]  You're probably going to see it.
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:39.701]  And the best thing to do, frankly, when that time comes, is be like a porcupine.
[02:45:39.721 --> 02:45:40.921]  You're not out looking for trouble.
[02:45:41.641 --> 02:45:48.365]  You don't want to fill anybody full of lead, but you will defend yourself.
[02:45:48.405 --> 02:45:50.786]  We're in for big trouble, sir.
[02:45:51.067 --> 02:45:52.187]  They are setting it up.
[02:45:52.447 --> 02:46:00.552]  As crazy as it sounds, North Com announced in Army Times three weeks ago, I asked Paul to do an article, but God bless him, he's been too busy.
[02:46:00.572 --> 02:46:02.073]  He writes two a day, so does his brother.
[02:46:02.874 --> 02:46:05.815]  I guess I've got to do it, but I'm trying to make films, do radio interviews.
[02:46:06.576 --> 02:46:08.617]  I think I'll be on air eight hours today.
[02:46:08.837 --> 02:46:10.238]  Eight hours I'll be on air today.
[02:46:11.192 --> 02:46:12.653]  At the end of this show, it'll be five hours.
[02:46:14.013 --> 02:46:14.954]  I mean, I'm exhausted.
[02:46:16.635 --> 02:46:27.440]  So I'm doing everything I can, but the biggest... I notice all the other quote patriots, most of them, they either nitpick each other, tear each other down, or they sit around and strategize all day.
[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:31.862]  When I got enemies in the Info War coming into the foxhole on top of me,
[02:46:33.849 --> 02:46:35.370]  I mean, I'm literally swinging my musket here.
[02:46:35.691 --> 02:46:37.612]  I'm not waiting for orders from headquarters.
[02:46:38.153 --> 02:46:40.575]  I'm not thinking about the best strategy.
[02:46:40.775 --> 02:46:42.457]  I am just going absolutely ape.
[02:46:42.477 --> 02:46:44.058]  You know, it's like when you get in a fight.
[02:46:44.078 --> 02:46:45.699]  I'm sure you've been in a few fights in your life, sir.
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:46.380]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:48.182]  I mean, back in the past, everybody did.
[02:46:48.202 --> 02:46:48.942]  Nowadays, people don't.
[02:46:49.122 --> 02:46:50.003]  They either shoot each other.
[02:46:50.023 --> 02:46:51.905]  You know, back in the good old days, you got in fights.
[02:46:52.635 --> 02:47:00.398]  I mean, you know, you might be afraid when some big guy's coming down on you, but as soon as his fist... I remember that, boy, when some big guy... I'd be scared at first.
[02:47:00.438 --> 02:47:01.618]  That's when I was getting jacked up.
[02:47:02.118 --> 02:47:06.600]  And man, as soon as that big fist would crack into me, or as soon as something... I wasn't worried anymore.
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:07.821]  I was on fire.
[02:47:07.861 --> 02:47:09.181]  Tasmanian devil, baby.
[02:47:09.441 --> 02:47:10.501]  I was glad it was on.
[02:47:10.902 --> 02:47:11.382]  And you know what?
[02:47:11.422 --> 02:47:12.222]  That's what we have to do.
[02:47:12.262 --> 02:47:13.082]  Just turn it on.
[02:47:13.323 --> 02:47:14.423]  Just turn it on!
[02:47:14.703 --> 02:47:15.803]  That's what you gotta do!
[02:47:16.083 --> 02:47:18.224]  You gotta turn it on and do those banner hangs.
[02:47:18.444 --> 02:47:19.965]  Turn it on with that spray paint.
[02:47:20.583 --> 02:47:23.865]  I'm just going to... You've got to just turn it on, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:47:24.466 --> 02:47:25.466]  Turn it on!
[02:47:25.787 --> 02:47:26.647]  Get her done!
[02:47:26.947 --> 02:47:28.388]  Make the thousands of copies!
[02:47:28.728 --> 02:47:29.849]  Make your own films!
[02:47:30.310 --> 02:47:34.232]  Buy the guns for the... We have to... Just, just, just... You know what?
[02:47:34.252 --> 02:47:35.293]  Just warn the people.
[02:47:35.553 --> 02:47:36.774]  We're starting to win, sir.
[02:47:37.154 --> 02:47:40.016]  And that's making the globalists really mad, and they're just going ahead with their program.
[02:47:40.036 --> 02:47:40.676]  Okay?
[02:47:40.696 --> 02:47:41.397]  I'm on the air?
[02:47:41.817 --> 02:47:42.438]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[02:47:42.958 --> 02:47:43.698]  Oh, thank you.
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:48.622]  My point is...
[02:47:50.697 --> 02:48:01.722]  The only way I see that anything is going to come of this is, is when they take away everything from all of us.
[02:48:03.743 --> 02:48:08.965]  And then everybody's going to have to bear arms and fight.
[02:48:09.365 --> 02:48:10.266]  I know, but did you hear me?
[02:48:10.326 --> 02:48:12.407]  They want us to wipe out the police and military.
[02:48:13.927 --> 02:48:15.668]  The best thing to do is avoid them.
[02:48:17.202 --> 02:48:23.584]  Okay, avoid, it goes into whole guerrilla strategy and a lot of, it's the second wave you've got to worry about.
[02:48:23.604 --> 02:48:25.924]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:25.964 --> 02:48:26.724]  I gotta let you go.
[02:48:27.665 --> 02:48:28.805]  Big news just broke.
[02:48:29.205 --> 02:48:30.505]  We'll tell you about it on the other side.
[02:48:31.506 --> 02:48:32.206]  This is huge.
[02:48:33.066 --> 02:48:33.606]  This is huge.
[02:48:44.289 --> 02:48:47.430]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:47.791 --> 02:48:49.731]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:50.091 --> 02:48:57.775]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.435 --> 02:49:05.498]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.898 --> 02:49:12.781]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:13.266 --> 02:49:17.288]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.608 --> 02:49:21.129]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.589 --> 02:49:23.450]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.850 --> 02:49:27.751]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:40.859 --> 02:49:43.880]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:44.201 --> 02:49:49.123]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:49.383 --> 02:49:53.725]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:54.025 --> 02:50:02.949]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:03.149 --> 02:50:06.751]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:07.051 --> 02:50:12.097]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:12.378 --> 02:50:19.086]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:19.597 --> 02:50:20.258]  What about you?
[02:50:20.898 --> 02:50:26.244]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:51:51.468 --> 02:51:54.552]  A former member of British intelligence just sent me this email.
[02:51:56.014 --> 02:51:56.614]  We've interviewed.
[02:51:58.677 --> 02:52:03.042]  Security alert as police lose a briefcase of dummy bombs.
[02:52:03.642 --> 02:52:05.485]  This just came out today on a train.
[02:52:06.185 --> 02:52:07.086]  Probably real bombs.
[02:52:07.126 --> 02:52:07.787]  You never know.
[02:52:07.847 --> 02:52:09.129]  Or maybe it's dummy bombs.
[02:52:10.092 --> 02:52:18.494]  And they're always practicing taking them on airplanes everywhere else and that's what the guys on 9-11 thought they were doing until the nerve gas took them out and the planes were remote controlled in the buildings.
[02:52:19.014 --> 02:52:21.235]  This is a London Evening Standard.
[02:52:21.255 --> 02:52:22.495]  We'll get a report out on this.
[02:52:23.215 --> 02:52:25.096]  We'll put it on JonesReport.com right now.
[02:52:25.576 --> 02:52:31.698]  A major security alert has sparked after police lost a briefcase full of imitation bombs and other devices.
[02:52:32.898 --> 02:52:36.959]  And it goes on to say that this has been going on since October.
[02:52:37.668 --> 02:52:41.192]  The incident was on October 31st, but now they don't know who got the fake bombs.
[02:52:42.133 --> 02:52:43.774]  Yeah, sure.
[02:52:44.155 --> 02:52:49.700]  It's like when the Russian police got caught planting bombs in a fourth building, FSB did.
[02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:53.184]  Moscow police caught them and they claimed it was just a drill, but it was real bombs.
[02:52:54.305 --> 02:52:55.386]  Just you people never end.
[02:52:56.790 --> 02:53:04.116]  Uh, who knows what's really behind that, or maybe one chance out of a hundred that it really was a guy who had fake bombs who works for the government.
[02:53:04.576 --> 02:53:05.197]  Sure.
[02:53:05.737 --> 02:53:10.641]  Hey, here's that old Disney piece from World War II where they're talking about Hitler and his New World Order.
[02:53:10.901 --> 02:53:15.745]  This is an anti-Nazi film because Hitler called for a New World Order, so they don't show these anymore.
[02:53:15.785 --> 02:53:16.185]  Here it is.
[02:53:16.946 --> 02:53:18.527]  Is he not the Superman?
[02:53:19.028 --> 02:53:20.589]  Are you not the Superman?
[02:53:25.934 --> 02:53:28.235]  Adolf Hitler's New World Order!
[02:53:51.900 --> 02:53:56.084]  You see, they use many different phases and many different people, but the program moves forward.
[02:53:56.144 --> 02:53:59.247]  Eugenics Extermination Program for you and your family.
[02:54:00.048 --> 02:54:01.189]  I hope you'll get TerrorStorm.
[02:54:01.229 --> 02:54:04.052]  It's still in the top 20 or 30 of Amazon.com.
[02:54:04.913 --> 02:54:08.656]  And I hope that you'll also get Freedom to Fascism at Infowars.com.
[02:54:09.357 --> 02:54:10.218]  Can't get it at Amazon.
[02:54:10.238 --> 02:54:11.179]  You can get it from us, though.
[02:54:11.219 --> 02:54:16.324]  You can get TerrorStorm for $9.95 with America Freedom to Fascism when you get it from Infowars.com.
[02:54:17.486 --> 02:54:19.547]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:21.767]  Let's move quick.
[02:54:22.107 --> 02:54:23.628]  Nick in Las Vegas, go ahead.
[02:54:23.648 --> 02:54:26.289]  Hey Hux, I'm a first-time caller.
[02:54:26.469 --> 02:54:28.249]  I was also right behind you at Ground Zero.
[02:54:28.269 --> 02:54:29.950]  Chanting 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:54:30.090 --> 02:54:30.710]  Well done!
[02:54:30.730 --> 02:54:32.810]  Yeah, it was pretty insane.
[02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:34.151]  I almost got through yesterday.
[02:54:34.171 --> 02:54:36.191]  I just had to make a quick comment about ManCow.
[02:54:37.092 --> 02:54:39.632]  Listen, I think ManCow is an idiot piece of trash.
[02:54:39.672 --> 02:54:41.953]  Hannity-loving, less-than-nothing, anti-American.
[02:54:42.335 --> 02:54:44.956]  For him to say that the firefighters are actors is absurd.
[02:54:45.336 --> 02:54:54.979]  I met all these men at the community church in New York, and I mean, there's nothing to them to tell their stories about how they're dying, and you know, it's just disgusting to hear Mad Cow make an accusation like that.
[02:54:55.019 --> 02:54:59.280]  No, no, no, that's why we had him on, was just to let him go and let you see.
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  I know, it's unbelievable.
[02:55:01.241 --> 02:55:02.801]  I mean, these guys are heroes, you know?
[02:55:04.226 --> 02:55:06.528]  Well, the firefighters are heroes and so are the police.
[02:55:07.188 --> 02:55:13.012]  And look, they've got a bunch of lies, we've got the truth, and Mancow, you know, is just an establishment lackey.
[02:55:13.493 --> 02:55:16.415]  But we're more than happy to get the info out through his program.
[02:55:17.375 --> 02:55:18.836]  Yeah, unbelievable.
[02:55:20.217 --> 02:55:21.638]  Good to have you here, my friend.
[02:55:21.678 --> 02:55:23.099]  Call me back when I get more time, Nick.
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:24.901]  Let's talk to New World Order.
[02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:26.382]  Where are you calling us from, New World Order?
[02:55:26.902 --> 02:55:28.823]  Yeah, this is on the NWO, Alex.
[02:55:28.883 --> 02:55:29.664]  How you doing?
[02:55:29.983 --> 02:55:30.203]  Good.
[02:55:30.243 --> 02:55:30.584]  What's up?
[02:55:31.304 --> 02:55:31.865]  A couple things.
[02:55:31.905 --> 02:55:34.847]  First, I sent an email to Kevin and Aaron last night.
[02:55:36.289 --> 02:55:39.371]  One of the biggest news bloggers on MySpace got deleted yesterday.
[02:55:39.411 --> 02:55:40.192]  His name's Andre.
[02:55:40.212 --> 02:55:44.736]  I sent him a cash link to the page and stuff so you guys could make an article with something about it if you could.
[02:55:44.856 --> 02:55:45.777]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[02:55:46.758 --> 02:55:49.460]  I've got a few... I hear the... Oh, is this the end?
[02:55:49.481 --> 02:55:49.741]  Alright.
[02:55:49.901 --> 02:55:50.662]  Yeah.
[02:55:50.722 --> 02:55:54.385]  You've got death row inmates on MySpace on Wired.com.
[02:55:54.405 --> 02:55:55.486]  They're trying to censor them.
[02:55:56.318 --> 02:56:01.159]  Um, you've got, uh, PayPal thinks I'm a terrorist on LiveJournal.com.
[02:56:01.419 --> 02:56:03.320]  These are just articles that I saw you guys have missed.
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:08.581]  Um, they, Monsanto, tried to do everything to destroy us.
[02:56:08.621 --> 02:56:10.642]  That's on IndieBay.org.
[02:56:10.702 --> 02:56:11.382]  Hey, we're out of time.
[02:56:11.402 --> 02:56:12.122]  I gotta let you go.
[02:56:12.162 --> 02:56:12.762]  I appreciate it.
[02:56:12.802 --> 02:56:15.443]  Call me back, uh, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:15.463 --> 02:56:17.384]  Central for the new program.
[02:56:17.424 --> 02:56:18.144]  Be sure and tune in.
