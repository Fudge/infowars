[00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:06.177]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:07.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:09.720]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.181]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:12.723]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.105]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:21.748]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.966]  Los Angeles at the Sheraton downtown.
[00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:55.189]  I just returned late last night from Chicago with their very successful 9-11 Truth Symposium.
[00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.069]  It was an overflow crowd.
[00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.830]  They were expecting about 300 people.
[00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:09.754]  It was well over 600 that were in attendance and so it did overflow the large ballroom and our LA conference is going to be massive.
[00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:13.435]  It's already sold more tickets than they actually had at their event.
[00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:18.810]  And I've been telling folks that the ballroom holds 1,000 people in Los Angeles.
[00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.131]  It really holds 1,200.
[00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:25.773]  But you can cram 1,200 people in there.
[00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:32.457]  I'm probably going to hold the tickets to 1,000 and then maybe keep 100 for the door or something.
[00:01:32.477 --> 00:01:33.357]  I'm not sure.
[00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:35.878]  You see, we've also got to have room for the press.
[00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:37.419]  And there were fleets of press.
[00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:47.194]  Newspaper reporters and some radio reporters and a lot of alternative media people at the Chicago event, including the New York Times.
[00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:48.976]  And so I will open with this first.
[00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:53.240]  I don't normally cover news that mentions myself.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.443]  In fact, I'd say about half the time I do it, I just briefly mention it.
[00:01:56.864 --> 00:02:01.689]  But this article is important because I'm in shock right now, actually.
[00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:13.881]  As usual, it's got some twisting in it, but it is the fairest piece I have ever seen from mainstream print in the United States on my activities.
[00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:22.803]  There have been a few Canadian major papers that have written fair pieces, a British paper, a German paper, some Japanese publications.
[00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:27.630]  Some Spanish publications, Italian publications have been extremely fair.
[00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:34.395]  Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, El Salvadoran papers have been fair, but never a U.S.
[00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:35.976]  story that was fair.
[00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.858]  And I never thought I'd see it from the New York Times.
[00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.781]  And so we'll look at it as a study of the media.
[00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:51.766]  We will read most of the article here on air when we get back from this first quick break, and then we will
[00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:55.557]  We will get into your phone calls.
[00:02:56.598 --> 00:03:02.402]  I don't have any guests today here on the show because I want to be able to take your calls.
[00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:03.683]  I really enjoyed Friday.
[00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:05.565]  I think we took about 50 calls in three hours.
[00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.366]  I want to do that again.
[00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:12.190]  I'm going to cover a bunch of international news, the fake grabbing of these people up in Canada.
[00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.652]  Oh, they foiled a plan to blow the Parliament up.
[00:03:14.872 --> 00:03:17.714]  Oh, save us, government, you're so wonderful.
[00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:20.276]  They foiled another terror attack in England at the same time.
[00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:22.018]  They're staging all this because
[00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:24.995]  The approval ratings of Bush have now slid to 25%.
[00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:29.662]  You've got some national polls at 32% and some others at 29% and 28%.
[00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:34.289]  Now respected polls have got Bush sliding even below that.
[00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.731]  Same thing with Blair.
[00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:37.634]  It's incredible.
[00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.685]  And I'm very thankful to the globalists.
[00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:57.416]  I mean, I've said that if we really back them into a corner and they're afraid to carry out more real terror attacks because they know we'll expose them, they will just save us finding dirty bombs, finding fuel oil bombs, finding fertilizer bombs, finding terrorists with nerve gas, with sarin.
[00:03:58.117 --> 00:03:59.698]  And that is indeed what we're seeing.
[00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:07.423]  So most of the time when we see these type of developments where they just have the staged events where they save us from terrorists,
[00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:11.147]  That means they're backing off big terror attacks for the time being.
[00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:12.248]  But not always.
[00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:14.670]  Sometimes it's a prelude or an intro to it.
[00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.913]  So when a big attack happens, they say, hey look, we foiled some of the attacks.
[00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:19.234]  We couldn't foil them all.
[00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.376]  And of course, I'll get into the evidence here.
[00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:29.583]  This is another event where they've had a bunch of these arrests in Washington State, in Oregon, in New York, in Ohio.
[00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:38.789]  Florida, in Texas, in London, in Germany, and then six months later, a year later, sometimes a month later, but it's always the same.
[00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:39.829]  Oh, they were really innocent.
[00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:40.830]  It really wasn't true.
[00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:43.851]  No, no, they weren't really.
[00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:49.113]  Or, well, we had informants inside, and the informants were giving them the orders to build the bombs.
[00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:54.496]  It was that, what, Ohio case just a few months ago.
[00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:56.077]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.137 --> 00:04:58.218]  We'll get into all of it today.
[00:04:58.238 --> 00:04:58.998]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:09.548]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:12.091]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:21.540]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.581]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:46.809]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.890]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.592]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:20.104]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:23.506]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:29.512]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:07:56.963 --> 00:08:00.164]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 1509.
[00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:06.306]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.047]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.747 --> 00:08:09.868]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:11.328]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:12.969]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:17.571]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:21.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.973 --> 00:08:24.974]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:31.038]  I'm very excited to be back with you live here today.
[00:08:31.218 --> 00:08:35.100]  It is Monday, the fifth day of June 2006.
[00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:57.986]  We had a huge, very successful, very exciting, dynamic 9-11 conference in Chicago.
[00:08:58.847 --> 00:09:01.769]  The New York Times deemed it the first 9-11 conference.
[00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:04.991]  I don't know where they've been hiding what rock they've been under.
[00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:08.113]  There's got to be 50 of these things around the country.
[00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:11.835]  They've had them with 500, 600, 800 people at them in the past.
[00:09:12.336 --> 00:09:14.938]  This was the first, though, that had so many groups.
[00:09:14.978 --> 00:09:15.878]  I've got to hand it to 911truth.org.
[00:09:18.195 --> 00:09:23.584]  They had, I think, over 40 presentations, some presentations with as many as 5 or 6 speakers.
[00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:28.492]  I mean, everybody who was anybody was there, and it was wonderful.
[00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:52.818]  I felt bad, though, because I wanted to videotape all of this, and everywhere I went, I mean, if I wanted to go to the bathroom, this is a funny story, I would, you know, walk out of one of the big conference rooms in the bathroom, people would come up while I was there at the urinal, and would start talking to me, and I'd say, hey, listen, I'm busy, I have documents, boom, in front of my face, I had to yell at one guy, I was like, hey, man, come on, give me some privacy here!
[00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:57.633]  So I did feel a little bit bad by the second day of the conference.
[00:09:57.673 --> 00:10:04.358]  I would just walk through the halls in a daze with all these wonderful people with so many comments, so many points, so many things they wanted to tell me.
[00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:08.240]  Sometimes I felt a little bit... I was never rude except for the one time in the bathroom.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.302]  At just a certain point, your brain overloads.
[00:10:13.163 --> 00:10:18.047]  I've got to get some rest before this LA conference that's coming up that I'm going to be putting on myself.
[00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:21.709]  So to do that, I'm going to go to the Bilderberg Group this week.
[00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:23.672]  That'll be my rest.
[00:10:24.032 --> 00:10:24.692]  I'm joking.
[00:10:25.053 --> 00:10:28.293]  Another attempt at humor there.
[00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:35.095]  Today we'll get into the staged terror sweeps in Canada and England.
[00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:36.335]  It's the same MO.
[00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:39.736]  We've got detailed reports up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:44.857]  Going over this for you, Paul Watson and Steve Watson have done their customarily excellent job.
[00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:50.738]  My team is here right now grabbing my speech, my keynote speech from the event.
[00:10:50.758 --> 00:10:54.741]  We'll be putting that on the web for free for all of you to see.
[00:10:54.761 --> 00:11:05.468]  And then before we leave town, we're going to try to put our interview with Dr. Morgan Reynolds, amazing interview in person, the chief economist for George Bush.
[00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:09.563]  Last administration, talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:12.005]  We'll get that up for the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:14.506]  We'll also get up a Steven Jones interview we did.
[00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:18.928]  We've got, I don't know, what is it, 45, almost 50 hours of videotape?
[00:11:19.968 --> 00:11:24.691]  Let me just tell you, for those that missed it, what the first day of the conference was like.
[00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.972]  I fly in Thursday night, Friday morning, I get up at 5 a.m.
[00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:30.353]  Went to bed at about 2 a.m.
[00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:34.115]  We get up, I drive into the city, because we're right outside the city, there at the airport.
[00:11:35.117 --> 00:11:42.742]  And we drive in to go on this big syndicated radio show, Man Cow, and I was in there for two hours in studio with him.
[00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:47.465]  Then we get back on the train, ride back out to the airport.
[00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:50.606]  I do a couple of video interviews with people I wanted to interview.
[00:11:50.707 --> 00:11:51.407]  I do an interview.
[00:11:52.007 --> 00:11:57.851]  Then we have a big press conference there with a bunch of the speakers from there.
[00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:03.259]  We marched out, hundreds of us, with signs that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:07.360]  Walked about a half mile to the L train junction.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.560]  Got on the train.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.481]  Hundreds and hundreds of people.
[00:12:09.501 --> 00:12:10.101]  You should have seen it.
[00:12:10.321 --> 00:12:10.981]  Well, you will see it.
[00:12:11.001 --> 00:12:12.302]  We've got video from every angle of it.
[00:12:12.742 --> 00:12:21.185]  We then ride back into the city and begin bullhorning the police and everybody else in downtown Chicago.
[00:12:22.415 --> 00:12:27.199]  And I'm there bullhorning, and it's echoing like I was yodeling or something.
[00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:31.382]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:35.345]  Google Operation Northwoods!
[00:12:35.385 --> 00:12:43.511]  And I could stop and hear it going down the concrete canyons of the Windy City.
[00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:46.333]  It was something else, is all I can tell you.
[00:12:47.128 --> 00:12:50.691]  People are walking up to me afterwards going, your voice is even deeper in person.
[00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:54.454]  Yeah, my voice is deep, ladies and gentlemen, because I scream too much.
[00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:58.257]  I think I'll probably lose my voice in five, ten years if I don't learn to stop it.
[00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:04.882]  That's why this week I guess my voice is going to be raspy and then hopefully if I lay off it'll get a little bit higher.
[00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:06.964]  It's getting deeper and deeper and I don't like it.
[00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:11.427]  People go, he tries to have that big deep voice.
[00:13:11.948 --> 00:13:16.151]  No, if I have to make myself clearly pronunciate, it is deep.
[00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:30.846]  Like, I like doing a little squealing, begging, you know, sarcastic voices occasionally, and I'm even having trouble doing those, so... I'm beginning to lose range in my voice, because people think that you just talk into a megaphone and it's loud.
[00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:36.268]  No, you project your voice into a megaphone, you scream into the megaphone, and it's even louder.
[00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:37.778]  We have video of this.
[00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:38.998]  Other folks would get on the microphone.
[00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:39.879]  It wasn't that loud.
[00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:41.360]  I would get on it.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.883]  It was just... By the way, most of the police were nodding their heads, smiling at me.
[00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:46.924]  I talked to some privately.
[00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:47.964]  Oh, yes, we all know.
[00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.747]  Kevin Smith has family that is... I'll just leave it at that.
[00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:52.708]  He's an airline pilot.
[00:13:53.548 --> 00:13:56.851]  And over the weekend, he was at a big barbecue with a bunch of airline pilots.
[00:13:56.871 --> 00:13:58.271]  And they were all, oh, yeah, we know.
[00:13:58.332 --> 00:13:58.932]  Yeah, we know.
[00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:00.093]  Oh, we all know the truth.
[00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:01.013]  Of course we all know the truth.
[00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:01.874]  Everyone knows the truth.
[00:14:03.852 --> 00:14:08.376]  I even had some of the Chicago security people, TSA, going, hey Alex Jones, keep up the good work.
[00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:23.909]  We have people all over the street in Chicago, just like we did in New York a year and a half ago when we were there for the convention, coming up, black men, white men, old ladies, young people, Chinese, Japanese, Hispanics.
[00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:26.420]  Let me just tell the New World Order something.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.761]  You're in deep trouble, okay?
[00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:31.043]  It's a lot higher than 50% in the new Zogby poll.
[00:14:31.483 --> 00:14:35.125]  By the way, the new Zogby poll says, believe the government was involved.
[00:14:35.885 --> 00:14:47.311]  One thing I didn't like was some of the 9-11 troopers would get up and they would quote the older Zogby polls, or part of the Zogby poll, and it's like they were too shocked to get up there with their own poll and read what the question was.
[00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:49.353]  It was just amazing.
[00:14:51.814 --> 00:14:53.615]  You know, normally I jump right into the news, but
[00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:56.423]  This is the news.
[00:14:57.264 --> 00:15:07.687]  The news of what we're doing, the effect we're having, what I see on the ground as your little reconnaissance probe buzzing around out there in the field.
[00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:13.309]  And I love getting out in the field, it's just that I've weighed the cost.
[00:15:13.889 --> 00:15:22.732]  We can have a greater effect here doing radio shows, making films, on a mass audience, than the more primitive form of physical protest.
[00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:24.553]  But I think it should be a cocktail, a mixture
[00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:38.375]  And then, of course, the physical protest gives us the dynamic images that we need to then put into films to give the viewer that communal feeling, that primitive rallying that we all need.
[00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:41.337]  So, I think I'm going to be traveling more in the future.
[00:15:41.637 --> 00:15:45.019]  Just if I did travel with all the requests I had, I would never be home.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.141]  But now I digress.
[00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:54.145]  We will get into the latest fake terror sweeps in Canada and London, over in the UK.
[00:15:55.026 --> 00:15:57.007]  We'll have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:15:57.728 --> 00:16:03.212]  But I first want to get in to this story out of the New York Times today.
[00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:06.854]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:16:07.274 --> 00:16:07.995]  Top story.
[00:16:08.915 --> 00:16:11.977]  500 conspiracy buffs meet to seek the truth of 9-11.
[00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:16.600]  And it's a lengthy article and it is extremely fair.
[00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:18.202]  This is the first time a U.S.
[00:16:18.262 --> 00:16:23.325]  newspaper, a big newspaper, but hundreds of little ones that have been positive, has given us a fair shake.
[00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:24.686]  Of course, they twist some things.
[00:16:25.464 --> 00:16:29.406]  They say in here that I go from quoting Roman history to foul language in the same breath.
[00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:43.631]  No, the intro of my speech was about Roman history, a little bit on Roman history, and then 30 minutes later I got into the USS Liberty and I quoted LBJ saying he wants the GD ship to go to the bottom.
[00:16:44.531 --> 00:16:50.673]  So I do not use profanity on air, I do not use it in speeches, and that is baloney.
[00:16:51.234 --> 00:16:54.475]  But other than that, it's a pretty fair piece.
[00:16:55.883 --> 00:17:01.425]  500 conspiracy buffs meet to seek the truth of 9-11, Chicago.
[00:17:02.525 --> 00:17:05.566]  And this came out on their Sunday edition, June 4th.
[00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:15.750]  In the ballroom foyer of the Embassy Suites Hotel, the two-day International Education Strategy Conference, really three days, for 9-11 Truth was off to a rollicking start.
[00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:20.957]  In Salon 4, there was a presentation underway on the attack in Oklahoma City.
[00:17:21.417 --> 00:17:27.501]  While in the room next door, the splintered factions of the movement were asking, for the sake of unity, to seek a common goal.
[00:17:28.022 --> 00:17:30.483]  In the foyer, there were stick pens for sale.
[00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.184]  More gin, less rummy.
[00:17:32.725 --> 00:17:36.587]  And in the lecture halls, discussions of the melting point of steel.
[00:17:36.687 --> 00:17:38.548]  It's all documented, people said.
[00:17:38.768 --> 00:17:41.010]  Or, the mass media is mass deception.
[00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:45.793]  Or, as strangers from the internet shook hands, great to meet you, love your work.
[00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:56.912]  Such was the coming out of the movement known as 9-11 Truth, a society of skeptics and scientists who believe the government was complicit in the terror attacks.
[00:17:57.492 --> 00:17:58.452]  The coming out?
[00:17:58.473 --> 00:18:05.017]  I mean, Jimmy Walter, years ago, bought $7 million of ads in New York documenting the inside job.
[00:18:05.037 --> 00:18:10.480]  There have been rallies and demonstrations for almost five years, weeks after it happened, there were.
[00:18:11.756 --> 00:18:19.542]  In colleges and chat rooms on the internet, this band of disbelievers has been trying for years to prove that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:18:19.602 --> 00:18:20.242]  We've been trying.
[00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:20.822]  We've succeeded.
[00:18:21.983 --> 00:18:38.435]  Whatever one thinks of the claim that the state would plan, then execute, a scheme to murder thousands of its own, there was something to the fact that more than 500 people from Italy to Northern California gathered for the weekend at a major chain hotel near the runways of O'Hare International.
[00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:42.627]  It was, in tone, half trade show, half political convention.
[00:18:43.087 --> 00:18:48.632]  There were talks on the Reichstag fire and the sinking of the battleship Maine as precedence for 9-11.
[00:18:48.912 --> 00:18:54.737]  There were speeches by the lawyers for James Earl Ray, who claimed the military conspiracy killed Rev.
[00:18:55.058 --> 00:18:59.241]  Dr. Martin Luther King, and by a former operative of the British Secret Service, MI5.
[00:19:00.482 --> 00:19:07.964]  We feel, at this point, we've done a lot of solid research, but the American public still is not informed," said Michael Berger, press director.
[00:19:08.324 --> 00:19:09.144]  I don't agree with that.
[00:19:09.204 --> 00:19:10.585]  The majority is now informed.
[00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:12.805]  Which sponsored the event.
[00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:14.666]  And it continues.
[00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:29.710]  Such red flags, as they are sometimes called, were the meat and potatoes of the keynote speech Friday night by Alex Jones, who is the William Jennings Bryant, the biggest populist leader in U.S.
[00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.030]  history.
[00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:33.039]  And that's who William Jimmings Bryan is, for those who don't know.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.561]  Beginning of the last century.
[00:19:35.621 --> 00:19:43.865]  When we get back, I'll get into this, and try to finish up the article as quickly as possible, and get into some international news, and then take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.

[00:21:02.134 --> 00:21:06.036]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:18.543]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.963 --> 00:21:19.364]  The U.S.
[00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:24.987]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:25.387 --> 00:21:27.608]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:29.469 --> 00:21:30.510]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.411]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:33.511 --> 00:21:39.553]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.620]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.041]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:13.301]  So what do you do?
[00:22:13.621 --> 00:22:18.182]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:20.787]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:23:06.239 --> 00:23:08.420]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.281]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:30.751]  We're good to go!
[00:24:04.926 --> 00:24:07.608]  Let me go back into this New York Times article, back up a little bit.
[00:24:07.888 --> 00:24:08.569]  I skipped some.
[00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:22.857]  I was talking about a skeptic who began to question why the 9-11 Commission had failed to answer how Building 7 of the World Trade Center collapsed like a ton of bricks.
[00:24:23.858 --> 00:24:27.300]  It was the 9-11 trigger, the incident that drew
[00:25:03.353 --> 00:25:04.154]  All right, folks.
[00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:09.437]  We're going to go ahead and roll the rest of this song and try to get our connection to the network that's up in Minnesota reconnected.
[00:25:10.097 --> 00:25:11.918]  And then we'll be right back.
[00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:14.320]  More and more of these suspicious problems taking place.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.700]  Stay with us.
[00:25:31.124 --> 00:25:58.147]  I'll stand my ground And I won't back down Well I know what's right I got just one life In a world that keeps on pushing me around But I'll stand my ground And I won't back down
[00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:28.337]  All right, in the past that happened a few times a year.
[00:26:28.377 --> 00:26:34.365]  It's happening more and more often, but we just so happen to have people here diagnosing it right now, so I apologize to you, the listeners.
[00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:39.993]  Let me now try again to go back to the New York Times article that we're going to finish up here and then take some calls.
[00:26:43.107 --> 00:26:53.171]  Such red flags, as they are sometimes called, were the meat and potatoes of the keynote speech on Friday night by Alex Jones, who is the William Jennings Bryan of the 9-11 band.
[00:26:53.631 --> 00:27:12.519]  Mr. Jones, a syndicated radio host, is known for his larynx-tearing screeds against corruption, fiery, almost preachery addresses in which he sweats, balls his fist, and often swerves from quoting Roman history to using foul language in a single breath.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.901]  And that's not true.
[00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:28.847]  I talked about Roman history at the very beginning and then I moved into about 20-30 minutes later to the USS Liberty and simply quoted LBJ in his GD comment about the USS Liberty going to the bottom.
[00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:33.970]  And we put a note in there on that subject.
[00:27:34.881 --> 00:27:45.540]  At the Electron Friday night, besides a digital projection reading, History of Government Sponsored Terrorism, Mr. Jones set forth the central tenets of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:27:46.610 --> 00:28:12.271]  That the military command that monitors aircraft stood down on the day of the attacks, that President Bush addressed children in the Florida classroom instead of being whisked off to the White House, that the hijackers, despite what the authorities say, were trained at American military bases, and that the towers did not collapse because of burning fuel and weakening steel, but because of a controlled demolition caused by preset bombs.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:24.068]  According to the group's website, the motive for faking a terrorist attack was to allow the administration to instantly implement policies its members have long supported, but which were otherwise infeasible.
[00:28:24.228 --> 00:28:26.890]  Well, that's from their own PNAC documents, that's why we say that.
[00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:30.053]  The control demolition theory is the central
[00:28:31.252 --> 00:28:31.692]  Wait a minute!
[00:28:53.937 --> 00:28:58.860]  That very report has given five separate reasons that Building 7 fell.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.142]  First, they said that the North Tower fell and knocked out its central support column, but that's not true.
[00:29:03.503 --> 00:29:06.244]  They admit that no major structural damage caused Building 7.
[00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:08.866]  Then they said a fuel-oil
[00:29:09.855 --> 00:29:10.836]  The container blew up.
[00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:12.077]  Now they admit that didn't happen.
[00:29:12.397 --> 00:29:15.159]  They say they don't know why Building 7 fell.
[00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:15.679]  Okay?
[00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:18.321]  Well, we have the owners saying they pulled it, they blew it up.
[00:29:18.701 --> 00:29:22.444]  We have New York Radio saying, get out of the building, it's coming down, they're going to pull it.
[00:29:22.865 --> 00:29:23.945]  It's all on record.
[00:29:25.026 --> 00:29:25.386]  Okay?
[00:29:28.168 --> 00:29:29.790]  So, we'll get back to this.
[00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.031]  Got about a page and a half left.
[00:29:32.051 --> 00:29:33.472]  When we return, I'll speed through it.
[00:29:33.492 --> 00:29:35.954]  Then we'll take your calls and do a bunch of other issues.
[00:29:36.014 --> 00:29:37.976]  But it's a pretty fair piece.
[00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:40.012]  Here out of the New York Times.
[00:29:40.052 --> 00:29:40.712]  I'm surprised.
[00:29:42.053 --> 00:29:47.376]  This reporter will probably now be given a beat in Antarctica.
[00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:50.598]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:52.299]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:54.400]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.002]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:05.476]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:30:05.696 --> 00:30:09.077]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:12.719]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.252]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:21.755]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:30:21.775 --> 00:30:31.400]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.881]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:38.324]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:30:38.824 --> 00:30:43.288]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:30:43.328 --> 00:30:44.709]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:48.752]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[00:31:01.371 --> 00:31:07.594]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.734 --> 00:31:13.898]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.178 --> 00:31:22.622]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.862 --> 00:31:29.886]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.186 --> 00:31:35.007]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:40.628]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.968 --> 00:31:44.049]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or night light.
[00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:52.290]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:33:14.424 --> 00:33:17.845]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to Midnight.
[00:33:17.945 --> 00:33:18.985]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:19.005 --> 00:33:20.226]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:24.367]  Your calls are coming up from Canada to Texas, so stay with us.
[00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:28.628]  Backing up one paragraph just so this makes sense.
[00:33:29.428 --> 00:33:33.810]  The Control Demolition Theory is the central column of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:38.111]  It's basic claim, and in some senses the one upon which all others rest,
[00:33:39.035 --> 00:33:51.981]  This is, of course, directly contradicted by the 10,000 page investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which held that jet fuel fires distressed the tower structure, which eventually collapsed.
[00:33:52.181 --> 00:33:53.922]  Now, before I go further, I'm going to add this.
[00:33:55.803 --> 00:34:05.107]  Within a day, they put armed guards all around the complex and said no photos, because people were taking shots of the steel, and we thank God have those shots of them perfectly cut off at an angle.
[00:34:05.638 --> 00:34:07.399]  That's what blasting charges, that's what you do.
[00:34:07.719 --> 00:34:15.484]  You blast at an angle, because sometimes you'll blast, and then the pillar, there's so much weight, it will just fall and rest on the section below it that wasn't blown out.
[00:34:15.864 --> 00:34:19.547]  So you blow them at an angle so they slide and slough to the side.
[00:34:20.807 --> 00:34:21.988]  There's a whole science to this.
[00:34:22.709 --> 00:34:32.855]  And they took the debris, it was blown in two-story and one-story perfect pieces, all of it, as it's falling, you see it shattering out in perfect little cuts, they haul it away and ship it to China.
[00:34:34.181 --> 00:34:36.243]  Now, that's what happened, my friends.
[00:34:37.244 --> 00:34:46.834]  That is the... And so, Firefighter Engineering, the oldest firefighting publication in the country, an organization, went public and said that it was a fraud and a cover-up.
[00:34:46.974 --> 00:34:47.335]  Okay?
[00:34:47.915 --> 00:34:49.397]  They're saying it's a fraud and a cover-up.
[00:34:49.737 --> 00:34:52.080]  Underwriting laboratories that underwrote the buildings.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.885]  Their chief engineer that did this... He was the chief engineer that did this study
[00:34:57.913 --> 00:34:58.653]  They did models.
[00:34:58.693 --> 00:34:59.633]  He was there this weekend.
[00:35:00.013 --> 00:35:06.615]  Kevin Ryan, who did the models for them to study this, but they were told not to release the data, showed it was totally impossible.
[00:35:07.995 --> 00:35:15.476]  Because jet fuel burns between 1,000 and 1,200 degrees, and steel doesn't start reddening until 2,500, doesn't start melting until 3,000 plus.
[00:35:16.236 --> 00:35:18.897]  It doesn't weaken until around 2,000 degrees.
[00:35:20.037 --> 00:35:22.577]  Now that's just the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:22.897 --> 00:35:25.938]  So the government can put out whatever report it wants.
[00:35:26.972 --> 00:35:29.873]  We know that Tower 1 and 2 were blown, but forget them!
[00:35:31.034 --> 00:35:32.134]  What about Building 7?
[00:35:32.374 --> 00:35:35.075]  It wasn't hit by a plane.
[00:35:35.715 --> 00:35:41.738]  And this very same report claims that the North Tower fell on it and knocked out its central column.
[00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:45.219]  A dust cloud hit Building 7.
[00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:49.401]  There's clear video of the North Tower's debris.
[00:35:49.821 --> 00:35:52.042]  It isn't even touching Building 7.
[00:35:54.341 --> 00:36:01.025]  The South Tower fell on Banker's Trust, that 60-something story building.
[00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:03.726]  It fell on... It's all in my film, Martial Law.
[00:36:04.267 --> 00:36:06.468]  It fell on Banker's Trust.
[00:36:06.828 --> 00:36:12.912]  Banker's Trust burned with huge 50, 60, 70 foot wide hot flames shooting out.
[00:36:13.792 --> 00:36:15.873]  The desk didn't even melt.
[00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.034]  The windows fell out.
[00:36:17.994 --> 00:36:19.495]  It had huge pieces of debris.
[00:36:19.795 --> 00:36:22.497]  The top third of the building fell off and crashed into it.
[00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:32.697]  I mean, imagine, you've got like 30 stories crashing into you, falling off, sloughing off, as it collapses, careening into the building, there's huge fires, and nothing collapses.
[00:36:32.717 --> 00:36:35.901]  Let me say it again, zero, zero, zero.
[00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:37.182]  Okay?
[00:36:37.402 --> 00:36:42.227]  You've got the Millennium Hilton, it's a little building, a tall, skinny little building, right up against it.
[00:36:42.627 --> 00:36:46.211]  Gets some windows knocked out, some stuff falls on it, has some fires, nothing.
[00:36:47.446 --> 00:36:49.928]  The North and South Tower both fell on the Building 5.
[00:36:50.448 --> 00:36:51.368]  Fell onto it.
[00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:52.389]  Fell on it.
[00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:53.230]  It didn't fall.
[00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.271]  Buildings are falling on it.
[00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:58.253]  It's a total burnout husk, but there is the skeleton.
[00:36:58.913 --> 00:37:00.714]  It's steel, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:01.155 --> 00:37:04.297]  Giant steel columns, 47 of them, 4 feet by 2 feet.
[00:37:04.317 --> 00:37:05.958]  47 in the middle of the building.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:17.446]  The very same National Standards Report says that there were no steel columns in the center of the building.
[00:37:17.646 --> 00:37:19.228]  It's like saying the sun didn't come up this morning.
[00:37:19.948 --> 00:37:24.852]  I mean, it's like if I got on the radio right now and said, water does not exist on planet Earth.
[00:37:25.193 --> 00:37:27.054]  I guarantee you there is no water in the ocean.
[00:37:27.735 --> 00:37:29.917]  It doesn't matter if there is, there isn't.
[00:37:31.078 --> 00:37:35.442]  They just said the columns don't exist, so did the 9-11 Commission, Whitewash Commission.
[00:37:37.183 --> 00:37:37.684]  Oh my goodness.
[00:37:38.687 --> 00:37:54.086]  So, they talk about how the 9-11 movement's central pillar, tenet, is that the basic claim that the buildings couldn't have been brought down by jet fuel, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology contradicts that.
[00:37:55.588 --> 00:37:58.131]  Contradicts it with Alice in Wonderland baloney.
[00:37:59.051 --> 00:38:08.213]  The movement's answer to that report was written by Stephen E. Jones, New York Times continues, a professor of physics at Brigham Young University, and the movement's expert in the matter of collapses.
[00:38:08.593 --> 00:38:14.014]  Dr. Jones, unlike Alex Jones, is a soft-spoken man who lets his writing do the talking.
[00:38:14.615 --> 00:38:24.737]  He composed an account of the destruction of the towers, and the New York Times gives a link to his huge BYU paper with the photos, the documents,
[00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.872]  They've now done thermite tests.
[00:38:26.892 --> 00:38:28.073]  They've done collapse tests.
[00:38:28.153 --> 00:38:35.001]  They're at the university with two other physicists that holds that pre-positioned cutter charges brought the buildings down.
[00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:37.704]  The New York Times links to the document.
[00:38:38.245 --> 00:38:38.945]  Ha ha ha!
[00:38:39.366 --> 00:38:41.128]  I've never seen something like that!
[00:38:42.657 --> 00:38:56.789]  Like prior generations of skeptics, those who doubted, say the Warren Commission or the government's account of the Gulf of Tonkin attack, the 9-11 truthers are dogged at home and in the office by friends and family who suspect that they may, in fact, be completely nuts.
[00:38:57.389 --> 00:38:59.771]  Okay, that's where the paper's twisting things.
[00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:01.873]  No.
[00:39:02.554 --> 00:39:06.977]  Everywhere I go, everybody I talk to, it is rare to find people who disagree with us.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.441]  It is extremely rare.
[00:39:13.257 --> 00:39:15.118]  So, we are not dogged by that.
[00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:18.020]  Again, you try to act like we are the minority.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.262]  The major scientific polls show we are now the majority.
[00:39:22.643 --> 00:39:25.885]  They can find one person at the conference who would say something they could twist.
[00:39:26.546 --> 00:39:34.511]  Elvis and Area 51 were sort of lumped together, said Harlan Dietrich, a recent college graduate from Austin, Texas.
[00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:38.193]  It's attack the messenger, not the message every time.
[00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:44.485]  To get the message out, the movement has gone beyond bumper stickers and kumbaya into political action, he said.
[00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:50.687]  There is a plan, Mr. Berger said, to create a fund to support candidates on a 9-11 platform.
[00:39:50.727 --> 00:39:52.988]  There is a plan to create a network of college campus groups.
[00:39:53.028 --> 00:39:55.229]  Well, that network's there, sir.
[00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:57.010]  It's kind of like, there's a plan!
[00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.430]  We're doing all this!
[00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.310]  We're the leaders!
[00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.671]  No, it's already there.
[00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:11.747]  There is a plan by the British delegation, such as it is so far, to get members of Parliament to watch Loose Change, the seminal movement on DVD.
[00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:13.688]  Yeah, let me just tell you what really happened with Loose Change.
[00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:17.839]  Their British distributor did contact Michael Meacher.
[00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:18.940]  He was planning to air it.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:24.722]  I got so tired of hearing this, wanting to know if it was true or not, that I just called Meacher and he said, no, I've decided not to at this time.
[00:40:25.162 --> 00:40:27.743]  Okay, so that was three weeks ago, but I just didn't talk about it.
[00:40:28.024 --> 00:40:28.684]  It doesn't matter.
[00:40:28.704 --> 00:40:32.365]  We've already got Meacher on tape saying it looks like it's an inside job and many others.
[00:40:32.405 --> 00:40:38.128]  So speaking of loose change, I'm going to stop right there and say a nice thing about these young men.
[00:40:39.488 --> 00:40:41.609]  I got a chance to meet them.
[00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:46.433]  And they were really intelligent, really smart guys.
[00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:51.875]  And of course, there's Dylan Avery, and Jason Burmiss, and Corey Rao.
[00:40:53.636 --> 00:40:54.756]  And they were really intelligent.
[00:40:54.796 --> 00:40:55.697]  We interviewed them all.
[00:40:56.637 --> 00:40:58.118]  Also, they interviewed us.
[00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:03.981]  And we went around together, kind of teaming up, doing interviews in each other's hotel rooms.
[00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:08.623]  Kind of killing two birds with one throw there.
[00:41:09.677 --> 00:41:12.578]  And I saw him giving interviews to the national media that was there.
[00:41:12.638 --> 00:41:20.461]  I saw him giving interviews to the folks that produced Super Size Me, the international phenomenon seen by 75 million people, millions of DVDs sold.
[00:41:21.202 --> 00:41:25.643]  They were interviewing him and those folks said, oh yeah, we know it's an inside job, oh no, we know all about it.
[00:41:26.204 --> 00:41:33.267]  I talked to them, so that was exciting to be talking to their cameramen and people and the producers and they knew what was going on.
[00:41:33.347 --> 00:41:36.488]  Oh yeah, we know, yep, mm-hmm, we're making a film about it, mm-hmm, yes.
[00:41:37.268 --> 00:41:39.129]  I mean, the New World Order is in a lot of trouble, but
[00:41:41.641 --> 00:41:42.762]  People don't know Dylan Avery.
[00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:43.563]  They don't know Jason.
[00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:44.423]  They don't know Corey.
[00:41:44.443 --> 00:41:45.884]  I never met him.
[00:41:45.904 --> 00:41:48.386]  Well, I met Dylan here in Austin, to be precise, to be accurate.
[00:41:48.946 --> 00:41:51.228]  But to talk to him, they've all had a lot of life experiences.
[00:41:51.288 --> 00:41:58.912]  Corey actually served in Afghanistan in combat and then served in Iraq in heavy combat in the Army Rangers.
[00:42:00.654 --> 00:42:02.975]  We actually interviewed him.
[00:42:02.995 --> 00:42:07.018]  We're trying to rush to get it up on the website before we leave Wednesday for Bilderberg.
[00:42:07.038 --> 00:42:08.799]  A whole separate issue.
[00:42:09.936 --> 00:42:34.985]  They were there in one of those famous, what you call, massacres, where there's a wedding party coming down the road shooting guns in the air, and they hadn't even been briefed, they'd just been put in country, this was right after the invasion, and so the wedding party was shooting out of the window, so they basically blasted an entire convoy, killing the entire wedding procession, killing the bride and the groom, and then after that some Christians came down the road going to church,
[00:42:35.785 --> 00:42:40.147]  The unit killed everybody in the car, I believe, but the five-year-old boy.
[00:42:41.687 --> 00:42:48.470]  But I appreciate the amazing courage of Corey in going public with this.
[00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:52.452]  I mean, I remember the massacre and talking about it.
[00:42:53.232 --> 00:42:57.954]  And it's not a massacre in the sense of the Marines
[00:42:59.814 --> 00:43:06.199]  An IED goes off, they go crazy, go into the nearest house and kill women and children, blow small children's heads off at point-blank range.
[00:43:06.239 --> 00:43:07.680]  That is now admitted in the Marine Corps.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.462]  Commandant, this happened, this went on.
[00:43:10.882 --> 00:43:13.905]  And the big story is the attempted cover-up by the Marines of this.
[00:43:14.345 --> 00:43:20.790]  If they just would have done the investigation, court-martialed who needed to be court-martialed, then it would just be part of war.
[00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.533]  But it's the cover-up and the media responding and the spin that makes this so bad.
[00:43:25.573 --> 00:43:26.574]  But to be totally clear,
[00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:31.063]  What Corey and his unit did was an accident.
[00:43:31.203 --> 00:43:38.428]  People are shooting, they hear the bullets coming their way, and they open fire.
[00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:46.334]  You would think that the Iraqis would control themselves and not engage in celebratory fire, but I guess they hadn't figured it out yet.
[00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:47.875]  I'm told they've cut way back themselves.
[00:43:48.235 --> 00:43:57.061]  So the Iraqis didn't know, this is just normal for them, and the troops didn't know, and they killed a whole bunch of them, including small children,
[00:43:57.814 --> 00:44:01.818]  But then the Army had them go over and over again in command in the next few days.
[00:44:01.858 --> 00:44:04.661]  They went out with metal detectors, looking for brass.
[00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:05.662]  They checked everything.
[00:44:05.802 --> 00:44:08.124]  And because they told the truth, nobody got in trouble.
[00:44:08.364 --> 00:44:09.625]  And no one should have gotten in trouble.
[00:44:10.206 --> 00:44:16.612]  The people who should get in trouble are the folks that put our troops in harm's way and that put them in this position.
[00:44:19.713 --> 00:44:20.813]  That's who should get in trouble.
[00:44:21.334 --> 00:44:29.557]  This war, where they knew it would be a guerrilla war, they knew it would be a breakdown of society, that was the official Israeli-slash-PNAC-US plan.
[00:44:29.957 --> 00:44:36.700]  This is all declassified, it's all public, it's been in major Israeli and US papers, to break the country in three to four parts and have endless civil war.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:47.144]  It's called the Balkanization Strategy for the Middle East, and Iraq is the fulcrum, or the center of the wheel, which the spokes all go out to the outside of the wheel on.
[00:44:48.124 --> 00:44:50.206]  So, the plan is to have our troops die.
[00:44:50.446 --> 00:44:52.228]  The plan is to have it in a quagmire.
[00:44:52.448 --> 00:44:53.709]  Then you get more weapons sales.
[00:44:53.729 --> 00:44:54.750]  You get to stay there longer.
[00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.493]  You get to build the dozens of permanent bases.
[00:44:57.513 --> 00:44:59.715]  The 17 big ones, 20-something other small ones.
[00:45:00.315 --> 00:45:03.618]  I mean, bases that hold 7,000 people with giant armored walls.
[00:45:03.658 --> 00:45:04.539]  These are citadels.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.000]  These are keeps.
[00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:06.381]  These are...
[00:45:07.097 --> 00:45:10.821]  And Corey agreed, and he said, I know why they fight us.
[00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:11.982]  I know why they stand up against us.
[00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:13.543]  At first they weren't fighting us.
[00:45:14.004 --> 00:45:16.966]  At first they were happy, but so many innocent people have been killed.
[00:45:17.207 --> 00:45:22.812]  It's now over 200,000, ladies and gentlemen, that the insurgency is getting bigger every day.
[00:45:22.852 --> 00:45:31.060]  And Corey, he's a decorated soldier who served in a very distinguished capacity in Afghanistan and
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.964]  I mean, he's been in reports on CNN, you name it, before this, and so they come back here and they make loose change.
[00:45:37.424 --> 00:45:39.606]  So you want to know who's making loose change, folks.
[00:45:39.886 --> 00:45:53.156]  It's people who have been out there in frontline combat, okay, involved in shooting up convoys of men, women, and children, and they know the truth, and they come back, and they're redeeming themselves.
[00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:55.778]  People think it's a bunch of
[00:45:56.371 --> 00:45:59.592]  You know, schnot-nosed young'uns.
[00:45:59.672 --> 00:46:01.972]  And this is also part of our society.
[00:46:03.473 --> 00:46:06.614]  Do you know how old Thomas Jefferson was in 1776?
[00:46:06.674 --> 00:46:08.854]  I want to say he was 27.
[00:46:09.394 --> 00:46:14.356]  And he was already involved when he was 20 years old in government.
[00:46:14.736 --> 00:46:14.916]  Okay?
[00:46:14.936 --> 00:46:16.096]  He could speak three languages.
[00:46:17.056 --> 00:46:18.917]  The average age of the founding fathers was 30.
[00:46:20.163 --> 00:46:29.086]  They teach us that we're supposed to be kids until we're 30, then we're supposed to worry about making money until we're 65, and then we shouldn't be involved in politics because, oh, I'm retired, this is my time.
[00:46:30.507 --> 00:46:35.048]  They artificially freeze you and freeze your development as men out there.
[00:46:35.268 --> 00:46:39.690]  It's always so amazing when I was 20 years old giving speeches at the Capitol.
[00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.051]  It was so amazing when I was making films when I was 22.
[00:46:44.497 --> 00:46:49.342]  It's so amazing that I was sneaking into Bohemian Grove when I was 26.
[00:46:49.843 --> 00:46:53.327]  It's not amazing, okay?
[00:46:53.527 --> 00:46:54.728]  It's not amazing.
[00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:56.150]  It's not in history.
[00:46:56.851 --> 00:46:59.794]  You have been told you're a child until you're 30 years old.
[00:47:01.047 --> 00:47:04.968]  Okay, in most cultures you're a man, you're a woman when you're 13.
[00:47:05.428 --> 00:47:07.309]  And I'm here to give you the newsflash, you are.
[00:47:07.629 --> 00:47:14.671]  If you haven't raised your kids to where they are basically young adults when they're 13, 14 years old, you haven't done your job.
[00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:21.073]  Stop protecting them, stop coddling them, stop trying to keep them from the world, what's really going on.
[00:47:21.474 --> 00:47:25.975]  Treat them like adults from the time they're one year old and you'll get real men and women out there.
[00:47:26.395 --> 00:47:28.856]  That's what our forefathers, our ancestors did.
[00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:31.932]  So there's this big, giant shock.
[00:47:32.713 --> 00:47:33.553]  Oh my gosh!
[00:47:33.593 --> 00:47:35.334]  You know, people this young can make films.
[00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:36.035]  Oh my gosh!
[00:47:36.355 --> 00:47:38.056]  You know, I'm now 32 years old, folks.
[00:47:38.076 --> 00:47:39.337]  I've been doing this for 12 years.
[00:47:41.198 --> 00:47:42.198]  I've been doing this since I was 20.
[00:47:42.358 --> 00:47:44.039]  And I know I said I'd take calls.
[00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:45.961]  We'll do it in the second and third hour.
[00:47:45.981 --> 00:47:47.101]  I've got to finish this article up.
[00:47:47.221 --> 00:47:50.523]  We'll get the Jim and Bob and Mark and Mike and George and everybody else.
[00:47:50.543 --> 00:47:51.244]  We're going to get to you.
[00:47:53.105 --> 00:47:55.606]  I've just now digressed off into how great these guys were.
[00:47:55.666 --> 00:47:56.487]  I really liked them.
[00:47:56.547 --> 00:47:57.408]  I liked their attitude.
[00:47:57.448 --> 00:47:58.328]  I liked their focus.
[00:47:58.408 --> 00:47:59.729]  I liked who they were.
[00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:01.797]  I enjoyed working with them.
[00:48:02.357 --> 00:48:06.161]  I was impressed by their knowledge and the work they've been doing.
[00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:07.762]  And you know, they haven't been perfect in the past.
[00:48:07.943 --> 00:48:09.244]  I haven't either.
[00:48:09.264 --> 00:48:11.526]  All of us make mistakes, but they're getting better and better.
[00:48:11.986 --> 00:48:13.187]  They're learning from their mistakes.
[00:48:13.327 --> 00:48:16.891]  And there's so many people who are just rabidly jealous.
[00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:18.792]  I even saw some of this at the conference.
[00:48:19.173 --> 00:48:20.914]  They kind of got dissed and a few things happened.
[00:48:21.835 --> 00:48:22.556]  And that's okay.
[00:48:22.576 --> 00:48:23.777]  That's a sign of success.
[00:48:24.398 --> 00:48:24.678]  Okay?
[00:48:26.545 --> 00:48:28.266]  Just the people that are jealous of success.
[00:48:28.446 --> 00:48:29.667]  Folks, we're all in this boat together.
[00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:37.812]  It's like we're all bailing water out of a lifeboat that's got a hole in it, and we're getting jealous of people who've got a big bucket.
[00:48:41.874 --> 00:48:49.779]  See, this illustrates my mindset and how I operate and what I believe and my philosophy.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.300]  I love it.
[00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:56.566]  When people out there are successful and people out there reach millions.
[00:48:57.647 --> 00:49:00.208]  But that's actually rare in the Patriot movement.
[00:49:00.528 --> 00:49:02.349]  Not in the people, in the grassroots.
[00:49:02.389 --> 00:49:08.571]  You are wonderful, beautiful, caring, intelligent, passionate, dynamic individuals who I love and I salute you.
[00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:09.551]  You're the best people on earth.
[00:49:09.671 --> 00:49:18.895]  But in the quote, leadership of it, the Patriot, the truth, whatever you want to call it, a lot of them really are egomaniacs.
[00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:21.752]  And you can listen to them.
[00:49:21.872 --> 00:49:31.937]  All they ever do is criticize and attack whoever is successful and then they claim that everybody needs to get on board with them and do what they say and get under their umbrella and we all got to work together.
[00:49:31.977 --> 00:49:32.978]  That means do what they say.
[00:49:33.878 --> 00:49:37.120]  Now I like this lone wolf approach or lone wolf pack approach.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.561]  Millions of wolf packs.
[00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:46.045]  People who work together, share information, but together all attacking different fronts, doing different research, pure research, hitting every angle of this thing.
[00:49:46.385 --> 00:49:48.006]  That's how we're going to defeat the globalists.
[00:49:49.878 --> 00:49:57.707]  So, before I finish up this New York Times article in the next segment, I want to encourage every one of you to stop procrastinating and go to InfoWars.com and get our Red, White, and Blue special.
[00:49:58.488 --> 00:50:03.094]  Get Road to Tyranny, get Martial Law, my two 9-11 films, and get Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:50:03.414 --> 00:50:06.438]  All three together, you'll save, I don't know, like twenty-something bucks when you get all three.
[00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:09.881]  You support them, you support what I'm doing, you support the whole movement.
[00:50:10.342 --> 00:50:15.346]  I've got a bunch of other specials, 14 different specials on Infowars.com, on the video, in the bookstore.
[00:50:15.366 --> 00:50:17.207]  Just get the films, make copies of my films.
[00:50:17.628 --> 00:50:20.830]  Make copies of Lose Change too, they let you do that, they encourage you, they're great guys.
[00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.512]  That's another good sign of who the good guys are.
[00:50:24.033 --> 00:50:26.114]  And get them, and get them out to everybody.
[00:50:28.056 --> 00:50:30.738]  It is so important that we do this.
[00:50:30.838 --> 00:50:34.161]  It is so important that we reach out to everyone.
[00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:36.742]  And that we do it now.
[00:50:36.762 --> 00:50:38.664]  And that you support those that do tell the truth.
[00:50:39.304 --> 00:50:42.528]  So go to Infowars.com, get the videos, get them out, make copies.
[00:50:43.088 --> 00:50:44.810]  That support also makes what we do possible.
[00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.974]  For cold toll free, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:50.075 --> 00:50:52.678]  You see, I know rising tides raise all ships.
[00:50:53.339 --> 00:50:56.342]  I'm in this to survive and win, and defeat the New World Order.
[00:50:56.802 --> 00:50:57.423]  What about you?
[00:50:57.443 --> 00:50:58.244]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:10.104]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:10.304 --> 00:51:12.625]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:51:13.225 --> 00:51:22.069]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:26.151]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:51:26.552 --> 00:51:34.897]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lt.
[00:51:34.957 --> 00:51:35.277]  Col.
[00:51:35.498 --> 00:51:47.365]  Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:51:47.686 --> 00:51:51.328]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:51:51.888 --> 00:51:53.128]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[00:51:53.488 --> 00:52:01.350]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:09.511]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.791 --> 00:52:20.693]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.973 --> 00:52:22.774]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:23.034 --> 00:52:26.355]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.695 --> 00:52:37.138]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.438 --> 00:52:37.938]  That's right!
[00:52:38.118 --> 00:52:45.240]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.662]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:49.822 --> 00:52:54.263]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:54.323 --> 00:52:54.783]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.968 --> 00:53:04.308]  I think so.
[00:53:19.213 --> 00:53:19.873]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.746 --> 00:53:51.828]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.988 --> 00:53:57.951]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.653 --> 00:54:07.816]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.476 --> 00:54:10.798]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.412]  This New York Times piece does one more deceptive thing.
[00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:27.515]  It misquotes the Zogby Poll, where roughly half of Americans believe the government was behind the attacks.
[00:54:29.076 --> 00:54:32.258]  Because the poll goes into, you know, do you believe they're covering up?
[00:54:32.298 --> 00:54:34.159]  Should there be a new investigation?
[00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:37.841]  And do you believe that the government could have been involved in the attacks?
[00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:43.424]  Well, they just take that out of there and just quote, part of the poll.
[00:54:45.112 --> 00:54:48.514]  Oh, that they knew in advance that the attacks were planned and failed to act.
[00:54:49.094 --> 00:54:54.417]  You see, so the New York Times didn't want to quote it, saying that half of Americans think the government was involved.
[00:54:56.338 --> 00:55:13.286]  And it goes on here in the story to end with, as for the 9-11 truthers, they were confident enough that their theories made sense that on Friday, as a kickoff to the conference, they met in Dealey Plaza for a rally, though some called it
[00:55:14.178 --> 00:55:16.000]  Dealey Plaza, whatever.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:21.064]  So I guess, oh, you've got Daley Plaza and then you've got Dealey Plaza there in Texas.
[00:55:21.624 --> 00:55:33.274]  They marched up the street to the local affiliate of NBC where at the plate glass window they chanted, talking heads tell lies as the news was being read.
[00:55:33.714 --> 00:55:39.819]  I hope you don't end up dead somewhere, a companion said to a participant hours earlier as he dropped him off at the loop.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.601]  Don't worry, the participant said.
[00:55:42.295 --> 00:55:46.777]  And that's how the article ends, kind of a chilling threat, I guess, there in the whole thing.
[00:55:47.617 --> 00:55:49.718]  But I guarantee you, Karl Rove is going to read this.
[00:55:50.299 --> 00:55:54.701]  I guarantee you, this will be looked at, because the New York Times is kind of the script for the New World Order.
[00:55:54.741 --> 00:55:57.342]  It's where they communicate with each other.
[00:55:57.902 --> 00:56:00.684]  It's where they get their information from.
[00:56:01.264 --> 00:56:05.446]  Though there's always a lot of spin in it, you'll get a lot of the facts.
[00:56:06.486 --> 00:56:10.008]  It is the paper of record still, to a great extent.
[00:56:11.025 --> 00:56:16.871]  And some of the neocons on Talk Radio are now attacking the story, going, it's too fair, it's too nice, it's too good!
[00:56:17.872 --> 00:56:24.598]  And I noticed the story was free to read on their website, now they've made it subscription, but we've got it and posted it for you at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:24.638 --> 00:56:34.007]  So, a lot of times stuff will slip through, too, on the weekend and then get pulled down later, but we have it saved here for you for posterity.
[00:56:35.623 --> 00:56:36.584]  It's a good article, though.
[00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:37.084]  Go get it.
[00:56:37.124 --> 00:56:38.004]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:56:38.144 --> 00:56:45.848]  We hope in the next few days to write an analysis of this report and post it on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:56.194]  I know a lot of you want to talk about what happened over the weekend in Canada, the supposed big terror sweep.
[00:56:57.242 --> 00:57:00.244]  And also what happened in England, we'll be getting into that.
[00:57:00.264 --> 00:57:01.625]  There's also going to be a huge U.S.
[00:57:01.645 --> 00:57:05.667]  government, continuity of government terror drill coming up June 19th.
[00:57:06.488 --> 00:57:09.129]  Back to the Bunker is the headline out of the Washington Post.
[00:57:09.149 --> 00:57:10.370]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:57:12.651 --> 00:57:19.155]  Also, we'll get into what happened over in England with the big terror sweep and the clear evidence that that's another staged event.
[00:57:19.476 --> 00:57:22.437]  That's coming up in the next hour after we take some of your calls.
[00:57:22.477 --> 00:57:23.418]  I appreciate you being patient.
[00:57:23.962 --> 00:57:27.164]  We will take 40 calls in the next two hours.
[00:57:27.244 --> 00:57:27.964]  It's 20 an hour.
[00:57:28.725 --> 00:57:29.945]  Go to your calls.
[00:57:29.965 --> 00:57:33.667]  I hope they're quick and succinct and focused so we can move on to the next person.
[00:57:33.687 --> 00:57:36.049]  Give everybody a chance to be on air.
[00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:39.211]  And I'll try to hold my comments down as well.
[00:57:39.631 --> 00:57:41.932]  Just the basic facts so we have time to get to all of your calls.
[00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:45.574]  The number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:45.594 --> 00:57:46.795]  You can talk about whatever issue you want.
[00:57:47.515 --> 00:57:50.497]  All the new terror sweeps that are happening with the government saving us.
[00:57:51.691 --> 00:57:53.574]  Or you can get into the 9-11 event.
[00:57:53.594 --> 00:57:58.879]  You can get into 1 in 3 Americans now having diabetes.
[00:57:58.899 --> 00:57:59.620]  What's causing that?
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.022]  There's so much here to talk about.
[00:58:01.763 --> 00:58:06.828]  China's saying they're going to control the weather for the upcoming Olympics there.
[00:58:06.848 --> 00:58:08.510]  I didn't know the government could control the weather.
[00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:09.711]  That's a conspiracy!
[00:58:10.392 --> 00:58:11.714]  This is from MSNBC.
[00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:12.635]  We'll cover that as well.
[00:58:13.863 --> 00:58:16.444]  Don't forget, tickets are exploding!
[00:58:17.544 --> 00:58:25.125]  I mean, they're just, they're disappearing, they're going fast to our conference in 19 days, June 24th, 25th, downtown Los Angeles.
[00:58:26.245 --> 00:58:28.466]  You do not want to wait.
[00:58:29.486 --> 00:58:31.006]  You want to take action now.
[00:58:31.847 --> 00:58:35.447]  You want to get your tickets at InfoWars.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:41.289 --> 00:58:45.953]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.033 --> 00:58:46.213]  Help!
[00:58:46.253 --> 00:58:46.713]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.733 --> 00:58:47.374]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.414 --> 00:58:51.857]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.998 --> 00:58:55.240]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:56.621]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.883 --> 00:59:14.006]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.507 --> 00:59:17.809]  It's always the same MO.
[00:59:18.949 --> 00:59:20.310]  A government sting.
[00:59:21.171 --> 00:59:25.594]  Busting terrorists that were about to strike in London and up in Canada.
[00:59:26.054 --> 00:59:27.355]  Government saving us.
[00:59:28.616 --> 00:59:29.957]  But over and over again in the past,
[00:59:30.598 --> 00:59:35.920]  They arrest innocent people or folks who they got to shoot their mouth off at a restaurant or at the mosque.
[00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:38.461]  We're going to go over this later.
[00:59:38.502 --> 00:59:39.962]  I want to go to your calls right now.
[00:59:41.443 --> 00:59:45.345]  Let's talk to Jim in Wisconsin and Bob, Mike, George, Chris and others.
[00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:45.965]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:59:46.725 --> 00:59:55.269]  Yeah, you brought up some great points earlier about the deliberate dumbing down and suppression of human development that's been going on.
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:09.947]  It kind of opens up a whole new can of worms that I'm sure you could do another three hours on, but I'd love it if you had Jordan Maxwell back on the show to talk about, what is it, International Maritime Admiralty Law?
[01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:11.949]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:14.130]  I think that'd be a good show.
[01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:16.911]  Well, that's the type of law we're under.
[01:00:17.372 --> 01:00:18.532]  It's called Marshall Law.
[01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:23.455]  Marshall by land, Admiral by sea.
[01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:26.311]  So it's the same thing.
[01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:28.732]  It is the law of kings.
[01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:31.753]  It is absolute pure principle.
[01:00:32.493 --> 01:00:33.673]  It's the government is God.
[01:00:34.174 --> 01:00:34.954]  That's what we're under now.
[01:00:35.434 --> 01:00:38.855]  And the court system and the banks are intertwined.
[01:00:39.216 --> 01:00:42.277]  I've got federal and state rulings where they say we're under admiralty.
[01:00:42.737 --> 01:00:44.338]  We've been under receivership since 1933.
[01:00:45.928 --> 01:00:53.715]  They have just parallel been keeping some of the old system because we expect it to still exist while building the other, say, new highway right beside us.
[01:00:54.195 --> 01:01:00.280]  Now they're shutting down the old road and just saying it doesn't even exist and forcing us purely over to admiralty.
[01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:03.063]  That's the Supreme Court ruling saying you don't own your private property.
[01:01:04.335 --> 01:01:08.458]  Yeah, I don't know when the last time you had Jordan Nunn was, but I think it'd be good to hear him again.
[01:01:08.738 --> 01:01:10.179]  Okay, listen, thanks for the call.
[01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.519]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:11.559 --> 01:01:13.501]  Let's talk to Bob in Nevada.
[01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:14.301]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:14.741]  Go ahead.
[01:01:15.002 --> 01:01:16.182]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:16.943 --> 01:01:20.525]  You talked the other day about the judicial watch.
[01:01:20.805 --> 01:01:30.771]  I had contributed about maybe $400 over two years, and I stopped two years ago because I kept writing notes and sending them in to him saying, what about 9-11?
[01:01:31.252 --> 01:01:33.033]  And to never do anything about it.
[01:01:33.939 --> 01:02:01.535]  investigate anything about it so uh... i would like to take them to small claims court where would i find the names you referenced uh... as to neil kahn's can you remember off-hand i mean i don't want to get into way into some deal about suing judicial watch i'm not calling for that small claims is strictly me but i mean uh... well kurt nemo wrote a big article about it and it's got the names the the the founder of the person who first funded judicial watch
[01:02:02.558 --> 01:02:07.162]  Uh, is a big neocon who ran fake government propaganda.
[01:02:07.262 --> 01:02:07.902]  From the beginning.
[01:02:07.982 --> 01:02:09.083]  Alright, that's good enough.
[01:02:09.463 --> 01:02:12.125]  Let me ask you about three organizations, if you know anything about them.
[01:02:12.786 --> 01:02:14.087]  Friends of the Border Patrol.
[01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:18.790]  Seems like a pretty good organization, but I haven't researched it in great depth.
[01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:19.471]  Okay.
[01:02:19.631 --> 01:02:21.092]  Mountain State's Legal Foundation.
[01:02:21.672 --> 01:02:22.133]  Don't know them.
[01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:30.779]  Uh, they supposedly have lawsuits supporting that, in effect, support the Minutemen, but don't mention them about, you know, the Border Patrol and stuff like that.
[01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:33.092]  Robert Vasquez for Congress.
[01:02:33.132 --> 01:02:33.892]  Do you know anything about him?
[01:02:33.912 --> 01:02:34.552]  No, I don't.
[01:02:34.632 --> 01:02:35.212]  I really don't.
[01:02:35.593 --> 01:02:36.193]  I don't blame you.
[01:02:36.293 --> 01:02:36.633]  Okay.
[01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:37.593]  Thank you very, very much.
[01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:38.213]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:38.253 --> 01:02:40.294]  I'm sorry I couldn't answer some of those questions.
[01:02:40.894 --> 01:02:43.475]  Yeah, I mean, Judicial Watch did some good stuff going after Clinton.
[01:02:44.776 --> 01:02:48.917]  And they did some good stuff criticizing Bush and the Bin Ladens right before 9-11.
[01:02:49.037 --> 01:02:50.818]  It's very strange.
[01:02:50.838 --> 01:02:52.198]  It was in the Washington Post.
[01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:55.200]  It was in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.160]  But I think that was building up their credibility.
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:08.974]  Then you look at who runs it, a bunch of defense intelligence people, and then every time they scoop up some FBI agent that's blowing the whistle about government terrorism, suddenly you never hear from that person again.
[01:03:10.015 --> 01:03:11.395]  You don't see a lawsuit out of them.
[01:03:12.816 --> 01:03:25.522]  And some of the big neocons who've been involved publicly in large CIA disinformation operations in Europe back in the 80s and early 90s have been funding Judicial Watch from the beginning.
[01:03:26.342 --> 01:03:27.382]  And that really is true.
[01:03:29.855 --> 01:03:41.922]  I don't know what you can say about them right now, but they come out and say, we have this inclusive video of a plane hitting the Pentagon, and it doesn't do that by any yardstick.
[01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:42.242]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:42.262 --> 01:03:49.607]  Mike, George, Chris, and many others, your calls will be live on air after this quick break.
[01:03:49.627 --> 01:03:50.047]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.723 --> 01:04:01.971]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.514]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:04:05.115 --> 01:04:13.964]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:18.006]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[01:04:18.447 --> 01:04:39.239]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many many others, including special guests.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.222]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:04:43.763 --> 01:04:45.005]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[01:04:54.076 --> 01:05:02.702]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:02.922 --> 01:05:14.149]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:17.051]  Yep, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:17.391 --> 01:05:23.856]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:24.016 --> 01:05:25.877]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:26.077 --> 01:05:32.102]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:38.026]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:38.346 --> 01:05:42.272]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:42.993]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:43.013 --> 01:05:43.714]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.187 --> 01:06:00.191]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:03.273]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:03.433 --> 01:06:08.036]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:13.020]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.943]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:06:18.163 --> 01:06:20.825]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:21.065 --> 01:06:23.947]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:26.249]  Looking for profits?
[01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:27.710]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:31.252]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:06:31.292 --> 01:06:38.857]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:42.460]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.201]  Secure your position today.
[01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.662]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:45.762 --> 01:06:46.022]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:54.787 --> 01:07:00.812]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:04.456]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.577 --> 01:07:10.841]  We're now eight minutes into this second hour on this live Monday edition.
[01:07:12.603 --> 01:07:18.127]  I'm going to Bilderberg Group up in Ottawa City, Ottawa, up there at their nation's capital where we've got this
[01:07:18.976 --> 01:07:26.661]  Big scandal going on right now, there in Canada, where, oh, there's a government saving everyone with a sting from Muslim terrorists.
[01:07:28.082 --> 01:07:30.764]  Simultaneously, the same thing in the UK.
[01:07:30.784 --> 01:07:35.107]  In the past, over and over again, these events have been staged.
[01:07:37.028 --> 01:07:41.751]  They have grabbed innocent people, or patsies, or people they've provocateured into just shooting their mouths off.
[01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.453]  I mean, understand, the government goes out, finds Muslims,
[01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:54.100]  Talks to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them in each town, finally gets a few idiots to shoot their mouths off, and then, oh, they're top terrorists, and then always, it turns out, it was staged.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.100]  In every case.
[01:07:56.081 --> 01:08:00.923]  I mean, they've had fake riots and fines in London, and fake arrests in Ohio.
[01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.184]  Remember, what was it, three months ago?
[01:08:03.504 --> 01:08:14.189]  They busted a bunch of Muslims, and then it said there's an unknown, unindicted co-conspirator, conspirator, inventing words, conspirator now,
[01:08:15.012 --> 01:08:21.213]  uh... unknown uh... unnamed co-conspirator who was a special forces U.S.
[01:08:21.253 --> 01:08:41.197]  government officer who was a friend of the government and went out and he was the leader of the group over and over again a SWAT, the leader of the London Bombers, MI6 protected the guys in Ohio, the leader he's working for the government you understand it's one thing if the government
[01:08:42.364 --> 01:08:47.185]  Has members in terror groups, and then actually goes and busts them, which they don't normally do.
[01:08:47.205 --> 01:08:54.186]  If it's a real terror group, oh no, the attack will be carried out, it'll even come out in the news that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, i.e.
[01:08:54.226 --> 01:08:58.107]  World Trade Center attack 93, but still no one gets in trouble from the government.
[01:08:58.847 --> 01:09:07.029]  But normally, whether it's Viper militia, or what just happened in Ohio, any of these groups, the leaders
[01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:09.038]  Our FBI.
[01:09:09.398 --> 01:09:11.260]  The leaders are Defense Intelligence.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.101]  The leaders are CIA.
[01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:19.967]  I mean, we got people posing as Muslim Imam leaders, who are government agents, and they go out and they tell them, Allah says do this.
[01:09:20.347 --> 01:09:21.709]  They get them to start talking about it.
[01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:28.154]  And normally when they bust one of these grips, it's because it's getting out of control, and the people are really refusing to carry out attacks.
[01:09:28.194 --> 01:09:28.975]  They're just talking.
[01:09:30.161 --> 01:09:32.543]  You know, the government's trying to get them to carry out attacks.
[01:09:32.563 --> 01:09:35.304]  The government would much rather have real people go do an attack.
[01:09:35.684 --> 01:09:39.187]  The problem is most people don't have, you know, that type of will.
[01:09:40.507 --> 01:09:45.991]  And so normally they can just build them up to the point of creating enough evidence that they were planning it and then bust them.
[01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:48.612]  That was the case of the Bumsteer Award, remember?
[01:09:50.033 --> 01:09:51.074]  Back in, what was it, 1998?
[01:09:51.614 --> 01:09:55.156]  They give out Bumsteer Awards here in Texas, what, 25 of them each year.
[01:09:55.956 --> 01:09:56.797]  It's a big insult.
[01:09:56.817 --> 01:09:58.458]  You know, people who do really bad things get them.
[01:09:59.167 --> 01:10:05.870]  In first place, what was it back in 98, it's in my film The Takeover, went to the FBI.
[01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:09.752]  Now they couldn't find a Klan group in Dallas-Fort Worth.
[01:10:10.133 --> 01:10:11.493]  There was just no Klan group.
[01:10:12.874 --> 01:10:13.755]  They couldn't find one.
[01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:21.599]  And so the FBI, and I'm not knocking trailer people, I got family that lives out in the country and it's a good cheap home, you want a trailer, put it out there.
[01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:24.680]  But there is such a thing as trailer trash though, folks.
[01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:28.302]  And they went out to a trailer trash area,
[01:10:29.577 --> 01:10:35.463]  And it was two husbands with their wives living across the street from each other in trailers.
[01:10:36.764 --> 01:10:37.865]  They were both alcoholics.
[01:10:38.826 --> 01:10:39.846]  They didn't have jobs.
[01:10:40.807 --> 01:10:46.693]  They were described by the Texas Monthly as literally being toothless.
[01:10:49.736 --> 01:10:51.057]  Inaudible.
[01:10:51.357 --> 01:10:52.918]  You could hardly understand what they were even saying.
[01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:58.261]  I mean, it was the type that just like... I mean, there are some of those people around here for those that don't live in Texas.
[01:10:58.622 --> 01:10:59.722]  Most of us aren't like that.
[01:10:59.762 --> 01:11:01.003]  We get stereotyped like that.
[01:11:01.363 --> 01:11:04.485]  I mean, this is the quintessential thoroughbred of white trash.
[01:11:06.547 --> 01:11:08.168]  And it took them almost two years.
[01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:12.751]  This FBI informant who had worked for the FBI for 23 years, been in a bunch of trouble.
[01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:14.772]  He went in there.
[01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:16.113]  He had FBI agents supporting him.
[01:11:16.133 --> 01:11:17.073]  He bought him whiskey.
[01:11:17.093 --> 01:11:17.994]  He bought him pot.
[01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:19.830]  He did drugs with them.
[01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:22.291]  And for a full year, he couldn't get them to do anything.
[01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:28.394]  So finally, he gets some black powder together and they put it in a Coke bottle, glass bottle, and they stick a fuse in it.
[01:11:28.415 --> 01:11:32.817]  And he buys them a video camera, because they couldn't even afford that, to videotape.
[01:11:32.857 --> 01:11:34.218]  He builds a little toy bomb.
[01:11:34.818 --> 01:11:35.779]  Most of us made as kids.
[01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:37.660]  Blows it up.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.600]  This is their evidence.
[01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:41.702]  And another six months go by.
[01:11:42.202 --> 01:11:46.965]  He keeps trying to get them to attack a chemical plant in between Arlington and Fort Worth.
[01:11:48.252 --> 01:11:49.152]  He can't get them to.
[01:11:49.252 --> 01:11:57.334]  And they drive around talking about how, because they have the transcripts of the audio tapes, we're going to take over the Capitol and I'll be president!
[01:11:57.394 --> 01:11:58.414]  You know, just delusional.
[01:11:58.735 --> 01:11:59.535]  I'm Superman.
[01:11:59.575 --> 01:12:06.116]  You know, like five-year-olds talk about how they're going to scale Gotham skyscrapers or sprout wings and fly to the moon.
[01:12:06.797 --> 01:12:09.857]  And it's stuff like, we're going to rob banks and be rich!
[01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:11.698]  And yeah, he didn't even own guns.
[01:12:11.738 --> 01:12:14.778]  He tried to give them money to buy guns so it looked like a better case.
[01:12:15.539 --> 01:12:16.939]  I mean, he literally went out
[01:12:17.711 --> 01:12:27.556]  And found people, created a four-person Klan group, I guess five with him, and tried to get him to blow up a chemical plant, and he couldn't, they were so stupid!
[01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:32.499]  And it's the same story over and over and over again.
[01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:34.920]  There was a famous case, what, in the mid-sixties at Berkeley.
[01:12:36.581 --> 01:12:44.405]  And the FBI goes in, they give tens of thousands of dollars to the group, suddenly they become the treasurer of the group,
[01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:54.674]  And they say to really show how serious this is, it took them again a year, they only convinced like two people out of a group that had thousands of members, this is a famous case, to go buy a stick of dynamite.
[01:12:54.694 --> 01:12:58.877]  At that time you could still go buy it at the, you know, the farm supply store.
[01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:09.946]  My grandfather, my dad remembers going when he was even a teenager and buying dynamite and they'd go blow stumps up clearing land because it's even hard with a, you know, with a tractor to pull stumps but dynamite will do it.
[01:13:09.966 --> 01:13:11.908]  You bust them up, side issue, doesn't matter.
[01:13:12.548 --> 01:13:13.209]  They go into the,
[01:13:14.272 --> 01:13:22.456]  The farming supply store, buy a stick of dynamite, they go stick it up in the mudflats above San Francisco when it wasn't built up then, and they detonate it.
[01:13:23.617 --> 01:13:26.418]  It was actually the FBI agent who stuck it in the ground and lit it, the others were afraid.
[01:13:26.979 --> 01:13:30.881]  They arrested several hundred people, a bunch of them spent decades in prison.
[01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:33.782]  People who didn't even know about it, the whole group got busted up.
[01:13:35.423 --> 01:13:41.186]  Presidents could get up on TV and talk about how there was this big terrorist attack and how all this happened.
[01:13:42.066 --> 01:13:42.867]  And it's the same thing.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.801]  I've had cops try to get me to do the same thing.
[01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.422]  And I just go, look, I know you're a cop and I'm going to call the police on you.
[01:13:48.442 --> 01:13:51.784]  And I, you know, they freak out and run.
[01:13:53.925 --> 01:14:01.949]  First I get their face on videotape and we've got a file in a safety deposit box in an unknown location or somebody else's name with all these cops faces and stuff.
[01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:03.530]  They ever try anything, we've got them.
[01:14:04.251 --> 01:14:07.212]  Let me just say on record, the last thing I'll ever do is blow something up.
[01:14:07.992 --> 01:14:10.073]  The last thing I'll ever do is do something violent.
[01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:11.274]  I know it's you guys.
[01:14:11.294 --> 01:14:12.755]  You're a bunch of murdering creeps.
[01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:15.163]  You make me sick, you trash filth!
[01:14:15.983 --> 01:14:22.086]  While our border's wide open, while our country's falling apart, while the dollar's imploding, you guys are running around.
[01:14:22.906 --> 01:14:25.467]  And that's exactly what's happened in Canada and in England.
[01:14:25.747 --> 01:14:29.409]  One big tip off is, notice in the same weekend they have two busts.
[01:14:29.489 --> 01:14:31.530]  It's all Commonwealth, UK garbage.
[01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.311]  And there's a bunch of other indicators.
[01:14:34.351 --> 01:14:35.511]  I haven't even gotten into it yet.
[01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:36.272]  Let's go to calls.
[01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:37.212]  I promised I'd do that.
[01:14:39.282 --> 01:14:42.523]  Let us go ahead now and talk to Michael in Texas.
[01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:43.224]  Michael, go ahead.
[01:14:43.924 --> 01:14:44.424]  Hey, Alex.
[01:14:44.464 --> 01:14:45.044]  How are you, buddy?
[01:14:45.184 --> 01:14:45.545]  Good, sir.
[01:14:46.105 --> 01:14:46.625]  Hey, you know what?
[01:14:46.685 --> 01:14:52.927]  I live in Austin, where you're at, and the Dixie Chicks said that they were not proud of George Bush.
[01:14:53.248 --> 01:14:58.310]  Well, I'm proud of you, because I'll tell you what, I deal with the neocons every day.
[01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.030]  I have websites that have been booted off.
[01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:06.493]  In fact, actually, as I was waiting for you to take my call, I just posted
[01:15:07.256 --> 01:15:09.037]  Mary Cheney, come on down.
[01:15:09.398 --> 01:15:18.864]  Are you going to be pissed off with Big George tonight when he makes that speech about how he's shutting down the gay marriage deal?
[01:15:19.405 --> 01:15:24.968]  I can't wait to see how that deal pans out, but I just want to say that I'm very proud of you.
[01:15:25.769 --> 01:15:34.135]  You give inspiration to a lot of us daily, and you keep up the good fight because you're a good man, and you speak the truth, and I'm proud to call you a fellow Texan.
[01:15:34.838 --> 01:15:36.179]  Well, I appreciate that, sir.
[01:15:36.879 --> 01:15:39.421]  Let me just add something to what you just mentioned.
[01:15:39.721 --> 01:15:42.744]  We know the Dixie Chicks have seen Road to Tyranny.
[01:15:44.445 --> 01:15:48.147]  In fact, we know it was given to them shortly before they went public, and so they were ashamed of Bush.
[01:15:49.828 --> 01:15:55.893]  They were viciously attacked everywhere, and instead their albums went up the charts, and they sold more.
[01:15:56.733 --> 01:15:59.515]  And now they've got a couple songs that are in the top ten.
[01:16:00.376 --> 01:16:01.517]  And so here's the example.
[01:16:01.577 --> 01:16:03.358]  Ron Paul exposes the New World Order.
[01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:07.803]  He has the highest re-election rate of any Republican currently serving in Congress.
[01:16:08.683 --> 01:16:12.885]  You come out and say you hate the war and you hate Bush, you sell more CDs.
[01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:15.746]  So the neocons try to intimidate everybody.
[01:16:15.786 --> 01:16:16.146]  No, no, no.
[01:16:16.526 --> 01:16:17.366]  It's popular.
[01:16:17.426 --> 01:16:19.007]  What we do is popular.
[01:16:19.027 --> 01:16:19.867]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:21.067 --> 01:16:22.988]  They are the hate America first crowd.
[01:16:23.308 --> 01:16:33.111]  You know, the neocons who all criticized Bill Clinton when he was in office, and rightfully so, but for the wrong reasons, were they the hate America first crowd when they criticized the President?
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:38.423]  Is it hating America to criticize bad policies?
[01:16:39.004 --> 01:16:43.307]  Bush's total blanket amnesty plan, his guest worker program.
[01:16:43.747 --> 01:16:44.427]  I'm against that.
[01:16:44.447 --> 01:16:45.628]  Does that mean I hate America?
[01:16:46.109 --> 01:16:48.510]  I'm against Bush doubling the size of the BATF.
[01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:50.131]  Does that mean I hate America?
[01:16:51.692 --> 01:16:54.995]  And I heard a talk show host talking about this the other day.
[01:16:55.015 --> 01:16:59.758]  I just so happened to be in a car listening to this last week and I happened to hear it.
[01:17:00.612 --> 01:17:03.853]  And I heard a talk show host last night driving home from the airport talking about it, and it was true.
[01:17:04.193 --> 01:17:18.696]  Limbaugh last week was doing his whiny voice, and then he said, it's the Hate America First crowd that doesn't like this.
[01:17:19.116 --> 01:17:25.037]  Now here's Rush Limbaugh, big government's the answer, the people that want civil liberties and freedoms are bad.
[01:17:25.718 --> 01:17:27.418]  What about when you were decrying Bill Clinton?
[01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:27.658]  I mean,
[01:17:28.405 --> 01:17:29.405]  How far out?
[01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:33.167]  I mean, it's now conservative to violate the Fourth Amendment?
[01:17:34.747 --> 01:17:42.290]  It's now conservative to spend more money than all presidents combined before you, and most of it on big welfare programs, not even war fighting?
[01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:44.971]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:17:46.691 --> 01:17:49.532]  I just don't know what to say anymore.
[01:17:50.613 --> 01:17:56.034]  And if you criticize the war, you criticize anything Bush does, you are the hate America first crowd.
[01:17:56.054 --> 01:17:57.795]  I heard Hannity
[01:17:58.427 --> 01:18:04.809]  He had a group on his show criticizing the Marine massacre, which is clearly a massacre.
[01:18:04.829 --> 01:18:06.029]  Any way you cut it, it's a massacre.
[01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.750]  I mean, they admitted they went in and killed everybody in the building but one little girl.
[01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:12.991]  And the Marines, the high-ups are admitting there was a cover-up.
[01:18:13.951 --> 01:18:15.011]  And it goes right to the top.
[01:18:15.632 --> 01:18:17.292]  We got Republican senators saying that.
[01:18:17.852 --> 01:18:19.573]  And Hannity's on there going, how dare you?
[01:18:19.593 --> 01:18:21.413]  You're the hate America first crowd of this guy.
[01:18:21.653 --> 01:18:23.494]  You even admit you don't know exactly what happened.
[01:18:24.554 --> 01:18:25.874]  And the guy was sitting there groveling.
[01:18:25.894 --> 01:18:27.895]  You only have people on that fall down and can't fight.
[01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:29.469]  That's why they won't have me on that show.
[01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:32.491]  I would eat their lunch.
[01:18:33.391 --> 01:18:35.493]  First thing I'd say is there's an admitted cover-up.
[01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:36.513]  That's criminal.
[01:18:37.234 --> 01:18:38.034]  Don't try it.
[01:18:39.175 --> 01:18:42.277]  Hey, you're the crowd that told us they found WMDs.
[01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:50.122]  You're the crowd that are a pack of congenital liars meant to pacify conservatives and bring in the new world order.
[01:18:53.925 --> 01:18:56.226]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:56.746 --> 01:18:59.587]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.507 --> 01:19:10.171]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:16.273]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[01:19:17.054 --> 01:19:27.858]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size, without adverse side effects, at a physician's office.
[01:19:28.498 --> 01:19:30.999]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:19:48.272 --> 01:19:49.613]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:19:49.874 --> 01:19:51.075]  One and the same.
[01:19:51.135 --> 01:19:59.762]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1%,
[01:20:07.873 --> 01:20:13.335]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.756 --> 01:20:16.897]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:17.137 --> 01:20:18.978]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:19.038 --> 01:20:22.059]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.820]  Here is reality.
[01:20:25.181 --> 01:20:28.782]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:29.262 --> 01:20:32.924]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.484 --> 01:20:36.065]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.

[01:20:55.481 --> 01:20:56.522]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:20:56.842 --> 01:20:59.624]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:59.885 --> 01:21:04.048]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:04.468 --> 01:21:05.309]  So what do you do?
[01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:10.193]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:10.683 --> 01:21:12.804]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:21:13.284 --> 01:21:27.988]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:21:53.610 --> 01:22:00.875]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[01:22:01.075 --> 01:22:04.097]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[01:22:04.217 --> 01:22:07.599]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[01:22:08.039 --> 01:22:16.905]  Grown-by-nature products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with co-factors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[01:22:17.345 --> 01:22:23.668]  Over 50 studies have been conducted on re-natured nutrients, and over 20 have been published in peer-reviewed journals proclaiming their superiority.
[01:22:24.029 --> 01:22:28.571]  As a result, Grown by Nature vitamins and supplements are now recognized as simply the best available!
[01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:30.512]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:22:30.932 --> 01:22:36.135]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Grown by Nature products today!
[01:22:36.595 --> 01:22:40.397]  We are what we eat, and since we are of nature, we should eat foods in their natural form.
[01:22:40.757 --> 01:22:43.719]  Only Grown by Nature offers a full line of re-natured nutrients.
[01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.280]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.843]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[01:22:58.206 --> 01:23:01.088]  Let's go to George in Canada, patiently holding.
[01:23:01.148 --> 01:23:01.808]  Welcome, George.
[01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:13.134]  What a coincidence it all is that now that Stephen Harper was elected Prime Minister in Canada back in February that we're having
[01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:15.885]  All these terrorists show up in Canada.
[01:23:17.146 --> 01:23:19.129]  I want to tell you a little bit about Stephen Harper.
[01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:23.314]  He's a Western Canadian, homegrown version of a neocon.
[01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.597]  He hates the press.
[01:23:25.898 --> 01:23:29.863]  If you're a member of the Press Gallery in Ottawa, you have to submit a question
[01:23:30.481 --> 01:23:32.602]  And have it pre-approved before he'll answer it.
[01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.642]  And he's also continuing gun control.
[01:23:36.103 --> 01:23:39.624]  He ran promising to reverse the gun confiscation you're now under.
[01:23:39.644 --> 01:23:40.404]  Exactly.
[01:23:40.544 --> 01:23:41.804]  And now he refuses!
[01:23:41.844 --> 01:23:43.385]  He's so conservative!
[01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:44.705]  Well, he's anti-gay.
[01:23:44.725 --> 01:23:50.427]  And of course the Bilderberg group is coming to town now to meet with him.
[01:23:51.427 --> 01:23:51.887]  Exactly.
[01:23:51.907 --> 01:23:54.128]  And he's probably going to be hosting the conference.
[01:23:54.928 --> 01:23:56.989]  No Canadians even know what Bilderberg means.
[01:23:57.029 --> 01:23:58.549]  He's been to at least two meetings.
[01:23:59.019 --> 01:24:03.280]  One in 96 and one in 03 in Versailles, France, where his picture was taken.
[01:24:05.521 --> 01:24:07.181]  It's just really suspicious.
[01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:08.582]  I don't believe it.
[01:24:08.622 --> 01:24:10.962]  They've got all this hysteria and hype in the press.
[01:24:11.142 --> 01:24:18.544]  On the CBC National News, there was one woman who was from Toronto, and she said, oh, I'm afraid to go to work on Monday morning.
[01:24:18.584 --> 01:24:19.725]  There might be terrorists.
[01:24:20.345 --> 01:24:21.105]  I mean, what a joke!
[01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:28.013]  Don't worry, there's nice men in paramilitary outfits, with shaved heads and perhaps in black helmets.
[01:24:28.473 --> 01:24:31.214]  They'll search you, don't worry, everything will be alright.
[01:24:31.234 --> 01:24:33.355]  The borders will stay wide open, though.
[01:24:33.415 --> 01:24:35.435]  Record numbers of foreigners being brought in.
[01:24:35.876 --> 01:24:41.858]  Well, I'm not very impressed with Stephen Harper, but everybody thinks I'm a total idiot and a freak up here to say anything against him.
[01:24:42.298 --> 01:24:49.701]  But I'd really like to know... Really, he was... Did you know that Laura Bush checked into the Mayflower Hotel, and she's had it with G-Dub?
[01:24:51.314 --> 01:24:52.374]  Sounds like a rumor to me.
[01:24:52.434 --> 01:24:54.055]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:55.235 --> 01:24:55.795]  I really do.
[01:24:56.536 --> 01:24:57.276]  Let's go ahead.
[01:24:57.296 --> 01:24:57.996]  I'll have to check.
[01:24:58.076 --> 01:25:00.277]  I haven't even heard that, so.
[01:25:00.317 --> 01:25:02.877]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Detroit, Michigan.
[01:25:02.918 --> 01:25:03.358]  Go ahead.
[01:25:04.318 --> 01:25:04.998]  Yes, hi Alex.
[01:25:05.038 --> 01:25:06.239]  This is Chris calling.
[01:25:06.839 --> 01:25:10.740]  We were hanging out with you on Saturday at the bar at the conference in Chicago.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.101]  I don't know if you remember us, but regardless.
[01:25:13.561 --> 01:25:14.061]  I remember.
[01:25:14.101 --> 01:25:14.941]  A lot of great people.
[01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:15.661]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:16.302 --> 01:25:16.842]  Yes, Alex.
[01:25:17.042 --> 01:25:18.782]  I have a couple of questions about the conference.
[01:25:18.882 --> 01:25:21.023]  I mean, we felt like
[01:25:21.365 --> 01:25:22.405]  You know, the conference was great.
[01:25:22.425 --> 01:25:23.365]  We had some great speakers.
[01:25:23.405 --> 01:25:24.026]  You were great.
[01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:26.946]  But something about the conference was bothering us.
[01:25:27.866 --> 01:25:31.447]  For example, first of all, there were government agents all over the place.
[01:25:31.567 --> 01:25:38.628]  I mean, there were people coming up to us, asking us questions like the New World Order.
[01:25:39.028 --> 01:25:39.989]  What do you know about them?
[01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:40.989]  I've never heard about them.
[01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:44.790]  I mean, why would you come to a 9-11 conference, you know, and not know about the New World Order?
[01:25:47.063 --> 01:25:48.584]  Is that your question?
[01:25:48.984 --> 01:25:49.364]  No, no, no.
[01:25:49.384 --> 01:25:52.286]  I just want to mention a couple of things about that conference.
[01:25:53.066 --> 01:26:15.859]  When we were sitting at that bar, the loose change crew, Dillon and all of them, they had their footage, the one hour footage, they had it announced that they want to air it and there seemed to be some internal conflict with the organization there and you guys ended up just packing your stuff and not showing it and we were just wondering why it seemed like
[01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.305]  You guys don't get along with them so good.
[01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:20.986]  I don't get along with who, sir?
[01:26:21.686 --> 01:26:24.547]  No, with the organizers there in Chicago.
[01:26:24.607 --> 01:26:30.430]  Why couldn't you, why couldn't Bill and the Lose Change Crew, why couldn't they air their footage there?
[01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:32.611]  Well, would you like me to answer it?
[01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:37.913]  Yes, you were mentioning also on Saturday that you would point out some things about that conference.
[01:26:38.173 --> 01:26:41.715]  Well, yeah, there were some things I didn't like and I appreciate your call.
[01:26:41.775 --> 01:26:42.615]  I'll comment on it now.
[01:26:43.636 --> 01:26:44.776]  Nothing's ever going to be perfect.
[01:26:44.836 --> 01:26:45.957]  No, what happened was
[01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:49.943]  They got behind, okay?
[01:26:49.983 --> 01:27:04.466]  I mean, if you've got speaker after speaker after presentation after presentation, there wasn't any time left to break down, because they kept changing how the stage was set up, they kept dividing the main room into four rooms, and then having it break down into smaller groups.
[01:27:04.926 --> 01:27:13.769]  And so they got so far behind, instead of them going on at 11 o'clock at night, they kept saying, wait, wait, wait, and by the end of it, it was 2 a.m.
[01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.749]  So that's
[01:27:15.339 --> 01:27:18.823]  That's all that happened, not a big, giant, great conspiracy.
[01:27:19.504 --> 01:27:22.507]  And yes, I was irritated by it because I went down there at like 11.
[01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:26.710]  And they had, like, ridiculous plays going on.
[01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:35.511]  I'm not knocking those to put them on, but it'd be a guy in a George Washington wig up there saying something, and nobody in there even watching, and people didn't want to really see that.
[01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:39.212]  And you had folks who they already pushed back not showing it.
[01:27:39.252 --> 01:27:45.313]  But it's not really newsworthy to sit there and talk about scheduling problems at the conference.
[01:27:45.773 --> 01:27:47.273]  It's not a big, grand conspiracy.
[01:27:48.093 --> 01:27:52.514]  Also, sir, I would just add that there probably weren't that many government agents at the event.
[01:27:54.022 --> 01:27:56.403]  Most of the people were wonderful, gracious, intelligent.
[01:27:56.503 --> 01:27:57.364]  I had a great time.
[01:27:57.524 --> 01:27:59.805]  Very intelligent, diverse crowd of people.
[01:28:00.445 --> 01:28:01.786]  There were also some schizophrenics.
[01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:03.987]  I mean, they get drawn to stuff like that.
[01:28:04.047 --> 01:28:09.769]  So there's a few crazy people going around who'd grab on me and just over and over again tell me, you've got to know this!
[01:28:09.789 --> 01:28:10.530]  You've got to know it!
[01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:11.250]  You've got to!
[01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:12.671]  And I'm like, you've told me 18 times!
[01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:13.071]  Thank you!
[01:28:18.053 --> 01:28:20.174]  So there weren't really a lot of government agents there.
[01:28:22.807 --> 01:28:26.948]  If there were any government agents, it would probably be some of the presenters who were there putting out this info.
[01:28:28.209 --> 01:28:29.509]  But you've got to expect that.
[01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:35.131]  The things I criticized about the conference, things I didn't like, I can tell you about briefly when we get back.
[01:28:35.692 --> 01:28:36.372]  Alright, stay with us.
[01:28:36.392 --> 01:28:42.854]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:44.655]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.115 --> 01:28:46.716]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.636 --> 01:28:50.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.321 --> 01:28:56.643]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:56.903 --> 01:28:58.945]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:28:59.085 --> 01:29:06.210]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:14.977]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:29:15.077 --> 01:29:15.297]  Yes!
[01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:20.001]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:29:20.141 --> 01:29:24.184]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.

[01:29:53.866 --> 01:29:55.827]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.927 --> 01:30:06.632]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.012 --> 01:30:11.534]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.594 --> 01:30:22.939]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.519 --> 01:30:30.361]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.761 --> 01:30:32.902]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.382 --> 01:30:38.344]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.664 --> 01:30:44.968]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.048 --> 01:30:49.231]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.451 --> 01:30:50.212]  That's toll free.
[01:30:50.232 --> 01:30:50.272]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.693 --> 01:31:01.556]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:31:01.696 --> 01:31:14.622]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:31:14.822 --> 01:31:16.603]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:31:16.783 --> 01:31:20.245]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:31:20.526 --> 01:31:24.308]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:29.512]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:31:29.792 --> 01:31:31.513]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:31:31.773 --> 01:31:35.736]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:37.857]  Dango is what you are looking for!
[01:31:37.997 --> 01:31:42.638]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.

[01:31:44.419 --> 01:31:44.959]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[01:32:02.396 --> 01:32:16.285]  No, I said in the last hour that I thought this conference was great.
[01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:18.546]  I thought they did a good job putting it on.
[01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.228]  I thought they had a lot of wonderful speakers.
[01:32:21.368 --> 01:32:22.149]  Maybe too many.
[01:32:22.969 --> 01:32:23.670]  It was wild.
[01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:25.571]  I mean, they would take the big auditorium
[01:32:27.389 --> 01:32:32.755]  And maybe once a day have a big presentation for one or two people like myself or Professor Stephen Jones.
[01:32:32.775 --> 01:32:38.221]  And then the rest of the time you'd have an MI5 agent in one room giving a speech about government-sponsored terror.
[01:32:38.521 --> 01:32:44.748]  In the next room you'd have Kevin Ryan of Underwriter Laboratories talking about how controlled demolition is where all the evidence points.
[01:32:44.808 --> 01:32:47.251]  And then in the next room, so I'd want to see all four,
[01:32:48.052 --> 01:32:53.894]  I mean, I'd be battling to get through the crowds of people outside wanting to talk to me to go videotape them.
[01:32:53.914 --> 01:32:57.795]  I'd try to split my three cameras up in different rooms to get it all.
[01:32:58.395 --> 01:32:59.215]  It was great, though.
[01:32:59.515 --> 01:33:04.536]  I mean, I think overall it was a good idea they had to do that because so much more got put out.
[01:33:04.556 --> 01:33:05.397]  It was amazing.
[01:33:05.417 --> 01:33:10.178]  Some of the things I didn't like, though, is a lot of the presenters and organizers
[01:33:11.269 --> 01:33:17.051]  Would get up and talk about the Zogby Poll and then just go, well the Zogby Poll says the people don't trust the government and want a new investigation.
[01:33:17.611 --> 01:33:21.532]  And I would get up and go, and it also says the majority think the government was involved.
[01:33:22.272 --> 01:33:25.693]  You know, the question in the Zogby Poll, government could be involved in the attacks.
[01:33:26.514 --> 01:33:33.876]  So, there's an amazing conservatism by a lot of people that I saw heading it up
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:41.462]  That individuals who've been in it a long time are, quote, more radical saying it's an inside job.
[01:33:41.502 --> 01:33:50.705]  But even relative newbies like David Ray Griffin and Professor Stephen Jones and Morgan Reynolds, they're all saying inside jobs.
[01:33:50.745 --> 01:33:54.126]  So it is very rare and extreme
[01:33:54.887 --> 01:34:01.335]  In the 9-11 Truth Movement to not believe it's a total, 100% made it happen on purpose.
[01:34:01.415 --> 01:34:02.836]  I would call it did it on purpose.
[01:34:03.197 --> 01:34:08.203]  I don't think made it happen on purpose is even strong enough of the four or five different variants.
[01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:22.861]  My only criticism is, I think that 9-11 Truth, who are great folks, are trying to be too conservative in their presentation, too conservative in, well, we just think there's a lot of unanswered questions and a big cover-up going on here.
[01:34:23.382 --> 01:34:26.486]  They need to go all the way, because that's what the evidence shows.
[01:34:27.415 --> 01:34:30.456]  That's what all their... I mean, every speaker I saw was saying that.
[01:34:30.797 --> 01:34:32.918]  I certainly wasn't radical there.
[01:34:33.498 --> 01:34:38.060]  And I had a few people that were attending, you know, who were involved in the conference coming up and saying, Alex, you're too radical.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.581]  I'm like, well, I mean, what about all your other speakers?
[01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:42.642]  They're all saying the same thing I'm saying.
[01:34:43.582 --> 01:34:46.724]  And at the same time, I... But again, this isn't even a criticism.
[01:34:46.784 --> 01:34:50.286]  It's just more of a discussion of the different views that are held out there.
[01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:53.367]  And really, that's my only view.
[01:34:53.427 --> 01:34:54.968]  And certainly, I mean, at 1 a.m.,
[01:34:56.078 --> 01:34:57.238]  The restaurant closes down.
[01:34:57.278 --> 01:35:00.880]  We're all in there in the crowded bar slash restaurant with all the smoke and all the rest of it.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.041]  And I've had six hours sleep in two days.
[01:35:03.101 --> 01:35:05.222]  I mean, yeah, I mean, certainly we're all sitting around.
[01:35:05.242 --> 01:35:11.764]  I remember you guys from Detroit sitting there at the table and we're griping because, you know, Dylan and them have made a really good new film.
[01:35:12.404 --> 01:35:14.005]  They've got all this new footage they've got.
[01:35:14.085 --> 01:35:15.005]  And I wanted to see it.
[01:35:15.025 --> 01:35:16.426]  I'd seen part of it in their hotel room.
[01:35:16.786 --> 01:35:18.186]  I wanted to go in there and see the presentation.
[01:35:18.206 --> 01:35:19.367]  We've been waiting for two hours.
[01:35:20.257 --> 01:35:24.440]  And it was kind of for some of the people that we were like, hey, they need to get on.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.903]  You know, you guys might need to reschedule the... I don't know if you should call it a burlesque show.
[01:35:29.923 --> 01:35:30.823]  That's what they were calling it.
[01:35:30.863 --> 01:35:31.264]  It wasn't.
[01:35:31.304 --> 01:35:33.045]  It was nothing risque about it.
[01:35:33.085 --> 01:35:35.426]  It was like skits and things.
[01:35:35.466 --> 01:35:39.108]  And I'm like, and then we're crowds of people going, we want to see the new loose change.
[01:35:39.168 --> 01:35:41.169]  And it just was kind of like a laugh.
[01:35:41.190 --> 01:35:43.211]  Well, whatever, guys.
[01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:44.932]  But it did air the next day, sir.
[01:35:44.952 --> 01:35:46.052]  So you may not have heard of that.
[01:35:46.092 --> 01:35:46.793]  You may have missed it.
[01:35:47.153 --> 01:35:48.394]  So it might have
[01:35:49.509 --> 01:35:54.673]  But really, I think overall this will be boring for the radio show.
[01:35:55.233 --> 01:35:58.175]  If I just talk about internal politics that don't even matter.
[01:35:58.676 --> 01:36:00.397]  It was not a grand conspiracy.
[01:36:00.717 --> 01:36:02.578]  If it is a grand conspiracy, I'll always tell you.
[01:36:02.959 --> 01:36:05.100]  It was scheduling that's why it didn't air that night.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.204]  And it was better it didn't air that night because it aired to a standing room only.
[01:36:11.054 --> 01:36:16.159]  The next day at about noon instead of 11 o'clock at night.
[01:36:16.179 --> 01:36:17.421]  It turned out better.
[01:36:17.441 --> 01:36:19.282]  I'll tell you, it was really great.
[01:36:19.302 --> 01:36:20.283]  It was Gabriel Day.
[01:36:21.525 --> 01:36:22.646]  Such a really nice fellow.
[01:36:22.746 --> 01:36:23.567]  I've known him for a while.
[01:36:23.587 --> 01:36:25.068]  I saw him in New York at the RNC.
[01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:27.630]  He's just really been out there.
[01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:29.012]  Janice Matthews did a great job.
[01:36:29.612 --> 01:36:31.154]  It was great working with all those people.
[01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:45.591]  I would encourage all of you who did attend that conference to come to our conference in Los Angeles, and if you didn't make this conference, believe me, I don't in any way want to put forward the idea that it wasn't a lot of fun.
[01:36:45.611 --> 01:36:46.632]  I thought it was great.
[01:36:47.032 --> 01:36:48.714]  I would give them an A+.
[01:36:50.936 --> 01:36:52.858]  Now, an A-plus is 95 and above.
[01:36:52.958 --> 01:36:54.339]  I'd give them just an A+.
[01:36:54.579 --> 01:36:55.840]  I don't think they made 100.
[01:36:57.172 --> 01:36:58.213]  But they got about a 95.
[01:36:59.114 --> 01:37:03.738]  And if I can do a 95 at my conference, I'll be really, really happy.
[01:37:05.239 --> 01:37:14.808]  Again, I'm just concerned that some of the leadership of the 9-11 Truth Folks are not at the midline.
[01:37:15.368 --> 01:37:17.190]  They're not even in the middle of the spectrum.
[01:37:17.851 --> 01:37:23.836]  The vast majority, it's inside job, total inside job, I'd say about 90% of people and the speakers.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:39.734]  And then you've got the extreme, extreme minority who aren't even sure it's an inside job at the other end of the spectrum over-represented in the leadership of that organization.
[01:37:41.996 --> 01:37:45.619]  So I've made my statement on that subject as diplomatically.
[01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:48.731]  as possibly can be done.
[01:37:48.871 --> 01:37:50.212]  I'm here for a Big Ten approach.
[01:37:50.652 --> 01:37:52.392]  Again, a rising tide raises all ships.
[01:37:52.853 --> 01:37:55.834]  Let's hammer through your calls very quickly because I want to get into England.
[01:37:56.114 --> 01:37:57.094]  I want to get into Canada.
[01:37:57.194 --> 01:38:07.038]  I want to also have Kevin Smith in here over the weekend talking to airline pilots and others at a barbecue, family and friends who are airline pilots and what they think about 9-11.
[01:38:07.098 --> 01:38:07.899]  It's pretty interesting.
[01:38:08.779 --> 01:38:10.680]  Before we do that though, let's go to the calls.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.301]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael
[01:38:14.426 --> 01:38:16.327]  And Michael is calling us from Canada.
[01:38:16.347 --> 01:38:16.727]  Go ahead.
[01:38:17.447 --> 01:38:18.428]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:38:18.648 --> 01:38:18.888]  Good.
[01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:21.649]  Good, yeah, you've sounded in good spirits lately.
[01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:22.769]  It's definitely good to hear.
[01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:29.812]  Just wanted to give you a quick thank you for featuring my Scanner Darkly trailer remix on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:38:29.972 --> 01:38:33.193]  If people want to support that, they can go to JumpCut.com.
[01:38:33.353 --> 01:38:35.574]  It's called Prison Planet Scanner.
[01:38:35.594 --> 01:38:37.195]  It's currently in the top ten.
[01:38:38.089 --> 01:38:39.609]  Thanks for featuring that on your website.
[01:38:39.869 --> 01:38:40.169]  Wow!
[01:38:40.329 --> 01:38:48.871]  Your video, because I know Jump Cut's a pretty big site, your remix of the Scanner Darkly movie trailer, which I did see, which we did link to, is in the top ten.
[01:38:49.311 --> 01:38:50.072]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:38:50.472 --> 01:38:57.573]  Hopefully, if people want to go to jumpcut.com and support that, it'd be a good statement to make it number one, I would think.
[01:38:57.593 --> 01:38:58.253]  You did a good job.
[01:38:58.273 --> 01:39:01.154]  I wish you'd take some of my videos and edit us some promos.
[01:39:01.534 --> 01:39:05.495]  Hey, well, I'd be, as a filmmaker, more than happy to work with you, that's for sure.
[01:39:05.555 --> 01:39:05.915]  Well, great.
[01:39:05.935 --> 01:39:06.575]  That's exciting.
[01:39:08.023 --> 01:39:08.723]  One quick thing.
[01:39:08.763 --> 01:39:13.927]  I was kind of surprised a couple months ago to hear Alan Combs call you a friend.
[01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:14.848]  Do you remember that?
[01:39:17.009 --> 01:39:23.114]  Alan gets away with what he can, and Alan has me on his show for a full hour, uninterrupted, saying the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:39:24.175 --> 01:39:25.576]  I'd call Alan a friend.
[01:39:25.596 --> 01:39:30.199]  I mean, look, a lot of people are government agents in media.
[01:39:30.219 --> 01:39:32.061]  A lot of others are just what you'd call
[01:39:33.047 --> 01:39:33.927]  I'm glad he called me a friend.
[01:39:34.007 --> 01:39:34.888]  I consider Alan to be a friend.
[01:39:34.908 --> 01:39:35.848]  We've had private conversations.
[01:39:35.868 --> 01:39:38.809]  I'm not going to divulge what we've talked about privately, but Alan knows quite a bit.
[01:39:55.222 --> 01:40:02.789]  Yeah, well it's interesting for someone to be a talking head for the New World Order, and then for anyone to call you a friend, they obviously know about the New World Order, right?
[01:40:03.309 --> 01:40:04.190]  Ah, yeah, that's it.
[01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:07.173]  But again, he gets away with what he can.
[01:40:07.193 --> 01:40:18.803]  He's wanted me on his show, and somehow it doesn't happen, the TV show, you know why, the name is Hannity, and he has me on his radio show, and he lets me say whatever I want, and he's gotta be commended.
[01:40:20.526 --> 01:40:22.007]  Yeah, definitely a point of interest.
[01:40:22.067 --> 01:40:23.968]  And one last quick question.
[01:40:24.409 --> 01:40:25.930]  What are your thoughts on Jon Stewart?
[01:40:27.011 --> 01:40:27.571]  Same thing.
[01:40:27.631 --> 01:40:29.132]  Knows everything about the New World Order.
[01:40:29.152 --> 01:40:31.293]  I know some of his producers personally.
[01:40:31.614 --> 01:40:32.995]  Gets away with whatever he can.
[01:40:33.435 --> 01:40:46.444]  The establishment has lost so many viewers, they're panicking and letting a few people, like Lou Dobbs, like Jon Stewart, like Alan Combs, just on his radio show, he's on a short lease on TV, tell a little bit of the truth.
[01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:48.767]  Because they're chomping at the bit.
[01:40:48.807 --> 01:40:49.387]  They want to.
[01:40:49.447 --> 01:40:52.270]  They're not all evil New World Order, but they're just not allowed to.
[01:40:54.071 --> 01:40:59.416]  Yeah, I tuned in last week and there was the all-seeing eye above his head for about five minutes.
[01:41:00.214 --> 01:41:04.497]  Yeah, they put out a comic book where the New World Order is involved in terrorism, too.
[01:41:04.918 --> 01:41:05.178]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.698 --> 01:41:09.821]  Is that like... Is that the New World Order saying they're in control of his show, do you think?
[01:41:10.382 --> 01:41:17.067]  Or... No, it's... They know that the hottest thing out there for the last ten years is conspiracy, and they're trying to speak to that culture.
[01:41:17.427 --> 01:41:18.708]  Look, I know some of the producers.
[01:41:18.748 --> 01:41:20.249]  They know all about 9-11.
[01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:23.412]  They're totally freaked out, and they're doing whatever they can.
[01:41:24.973 --> 01:41:27.755]  See, there is a rebellion inside the mainstream media.
[01:41:32.158 --> 01:41:33.199]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:41:33.219 --> 01:41:34.079]  Does that answer your questions?
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:35.120]  Oh, sure it does.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.804]  And I'm glad you're coming up here to Canada to expose the Bilderbergs.
[01:41:40.064 --> 01:41:41.025]  I'll be there in three days.
[01:41:41.285 --> 01:41:45.769]  Yeah, the CBC was the only major news network to ever do a news piece on Bilderberg.
[01:41:45.909 --> 01:41:49.012]  I didn't see another Canadian news article about it in the last week though.
[01:41:49.873 --> 01:41:50.173]  Oh yeah?
[01:41:50.453 --> 01:41:50.593]  Yep.
[01:41:50.853 --> 01:41:51.714]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:41:51.754 --> 01:41:52.315]  Appreciate it.
[01:41:53.255 --> 01:41:57.499]  Let's type Bilderberg into Google News and it should pop up for you.
[01:41:58.231 --> 01:42:01.333]  Let's go ahead, not web folks, news.
[01:42:02.633 --> 01:42:06.095]  Let's go ahead, and for those that don't know, they'll think that's some code word.
[01:42:06.556 --> 01:42:11.178]  The point is, you can click on web, and that shows you everything on the web, and they've got everything that's news-wise on the web.
[01:42:11.198 --> 01:42:12.819]  If you click news, it searches that.
[01:42:13.139 --> 01:42:16.761]  I know you know that, most listeners do, and are more computer savvy than I am.
[01:42:16.801 --> 01:42:19.362]  I'm not very savvy, but I'm getting better.
[01:42:20.083 --> 01:42:22.324]  The point is, I was just trying to explain that.
[01:42:22.464 --> 01:42:26.006]  Now, but to somebody who doesn't know how a computer works, they'll think it just sounds like Greek.
[01:42:26.944 --> 01:42:29.326]  Let's talk to Tom in Michigan.
[01:42:29.366 --> 01:42:30.167]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:42:30.487 --> 01:42:31.028]  Alright, thank you.
[01:42:31.048 --> 01:42:39.515]  Hey, how can we the people call for a constitutional dissolution of the federal government?
[01:42:40.236 --> 01:42:41.197]  How might that take place?
[01:42:41.698 --> 01:42:43.639]  Well, it would take place at the state level.
[01:42:44.039 --> 01:42:46.220]  The states can call for impeachment of the executive.
[01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:49.022]  And states have right to revolt clauses.
[01:42:49.582 --> 01:42:57.166]  Right to revolt clauses that are in New Hampshire and Vermont and other state constitutions.
[01:42:58.046 --> 01:42:59.647]  And it could happen, sir.
[01:43:01.188 --> 01:43:01.468]  Okay.
[01:43:01.868 --> 01:43:02.408]  Thank you very much.
[01:43:02.588 --> 01:43:02.948]  Thank you.
[01:43:02.988 --> 01:43:03.989]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:04.824 --> 01:43:10.406]  In fact, several states were on the verge of withdrawing from the Union two weeks before 9-11.
[01:43:10.426 --> 01:43:15.567]  I was interviewing state reps and others who were doing that, and then that all got derailed.
[01:43:16.148 --> 01:43:18.708]  And again, I'm not for America fading away and going away.
[01:43:19.289 --> 01:43:26.831]  But our founding fathers told us that when the federal government gets out of control, it's our right, our duty, to abolish it and set it back up.
[01:43:27.739 --> 01:43:29.581]  And I don't even want the states to fully pull out.
[01:43:30.041 --> 01:43:40.069]  I want them to just reassert their 10th Amendment, cut federal funds, cut raising funds at the state level and giving it as tribute to the feds, to then have a small portion given back with strings attached.
[01:43:40.570 --> 01:43:56.043]  And I think an alliance of free states, together, against the war, against the scams, against the open borders, a coalition is a good way to put the feds back in their place, which is very limited in its scope of duties and powers.
[01:43:57.037 --> 01:44:01.240]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Reagan in California.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:01.900]  Reagan, welcome.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.281]  Hi, how are you?
[01:44:03.401 --> 01:44:03.681]  Good.
[01:44:04.442 --> 01:44:06.683]  A friend of mine gave me this.
[01:44:07.623 --> 01:44:10.565]  His name is Richard Andrew Grove.
[01:44:11.266 --> 01:44:14.568]  He's an insider and he did a two-hour interview.
[01:44:15.008 --> 01:44:16.269]  Her name is Maria Heller.
[01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:23.488]  The stuff that he talks about, I'm asking anybody who can to go and look at it.
[01:44:23.528 --> 01:44:24.749]  You Google it.
[01:44:24.789 --> 01:44:27.470]  Do me a favor, just tell us, for those that don't know, just tell us about it.
[01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:32.293]  Some of the things that he found, he had all kinds of insider information on the World Trade Center.
[01:44:32.793 --> 01:44:37.236]  Martian McClellan, who had offices in the North Tower, was part of it.
[01:44:38.797 --> 01:44:43.680]  One of his bosses on 9-11 made a conference call from his apartment in the West
[01:44:44.406 --> 01:44:45.466]  I don't know.
[01:45:06.278 --> 01:45:08.660]  American Express ruined his life.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.721]  He lost his credit card, his job.
[01:45:10.961 --> 01:45:11.681]  Okay, listen.
[01:45:11.701 --> 01:45:13.042]  Ma'am, thanks for the call.
[01:45:13.082 --> 01:45:13.963]  Just send me some info.
[01:45:14.003 --> 01:45:15.063]  I've heard a little bit about it.
[01:45:15.103 --> 01:45:22.688]  I want to research it first before I go jumping off the deep end with the new interview that's got it all proven.
[01:45:23.248 --> 01:45:26.791]  But I'll try to research that, and then perhaps I'll have that individual on.
[01:45:27.131 --> 01:45:27.911]  Thank you, Reagan.
[01:45:28.351 --> 01:45:29.412]  Alex, in mass.
[01:45:29.432 --> 01:45:29.972]  You're on the air.
[01:45:30.013 --> 01:45:30.393]  Go ahead.
[01:45:30.953 --> 01:45:31.994]  Hey, I was wondering.
[01:45:32.214 --> 01:45:33.975]  I was thinking of making... Alex?
[01:45:34.495 --> 01:45:35.596]  Yeah, you're on the air, sir.
[01:45:36.512 --> 01:45:37.432]  We can talk if you want.
[01:45:37.452 --> 01:45:39.413]  Excuse me?
[01:45:40.113 --> 01:45:40.713]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:45:41.354 --> 01:45:41.974]  Oh, sorry about that.
[01:45:42.654 --> 01:45:47.395]  I wanted to say, uh, we're making flyers and just hand them out to everyone.
[01:45:49.356 --> 01:45:51.817]  And just please tell them what's drinking.
[01:45:52.617 --> 01:45:57.758]  I'll show them that it makes them psychotic and gives them diseases.
[01:45:58.399 --> 01:46:00.999]  Yeah, big problem is I didn't understand much of what you said.
[01:46:01.019 --> 01:46:01.840]  You're on a cell phone?
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:03.020]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:46:04.125 --> 01:46:06.906]  Yeah, I'm not making out much of it.
[01:46:07.607 --> 01:46:08.227]  Are you moving?
[01:46:08.267 --> 01:46:09.108]  Are you in a car?
[01:46:09.128 --> 01:46:10.468]  Yes, I am in a car.
[01:46:11.429 --> 01:46:13.430]  Yeah, I'm going to have to let you go.
[01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:15.210]  I'd really like to hear what you have to say.
[01:46:15.231 --> 01:46:20.013]  You know, it's really frustrating to me because so many great people call in on cell phones.
[01:46:20.053 --> 01:46:21.534]  I do it myself on the talk radio.
[01:46:22.694 --> 01:46:25.496]  And the new cell phones are even worse than the old cell phones.
[01:46:26.416 --> 01:46:28.097]  That's why I still have one of the old cell phones.
[01:46:28.337 --> 01:46:30.438]  That and it's not trackable, at least at this time.
[01:46:31.511 --> 01:46:35.453]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on this situation with Stephen Harper, something that probably not a lot of Canadians know.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.822]  Starting to look like he's definitely either a globalist or one of the tools of the globalists.
[01:46:58.842 --> 01:46:59.562]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:46:59.722 --> 01:47:05.405]  Most Americans, and I'm sad to say, have trouble even finding Canada on a map, and that's not a joke.
[01:47:05.505 --> 01:47:07.867]  So, for those who don't know, he's your Prime Minister.
[01:47:08.567 --> 01:47:09.107]  Yes, indeed.
[01:47:09.127 --> 01:47:10.948]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:47:10.988 --> 01:47:18.552]  I haven't been able to link him to the Bohemian Club, but his senior political advisor, his personal Karl Rove, if you will, is a member of the Bohemian Club.
[01:47:18.592 --> 01:47:21.554]  Well, yes, and he's been to Bilderberg at least twice, too, sir.
[01:47:21.894 --> 01:47:23.595]  Mr. Harper is total New World Order.
[01:47:24.318 --> 01:47:24.778]  Yeah, okay.
[01:47:24.798 --> 01:47:27.499]  I just wanted Canadians to know that, and I want to thank you for everything you're doing.
[01:47:28.099 --> 01:47:29.299]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:47:29.739 --> 01:47:30.499]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:47:30.519 --> 01:47:31.879]  What do you think of that New York Times article?
[01:47:31.899 --> 01:47:32.419]  Did you hear that?
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.340]  No, I haven't heard anything about that.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.000]  Yeah, they wrote a big piece, and I think it's pretty fair.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:43.381]  They even linked to Professor Stephen Jones' own BYU physics report about the bombs in the buildings.
[01:47:44.501 --> 01:47:48.862]  Well, it looked to me like, you know, I mean, something was fishy the day of 9-11.
[01:47:48.882 --> 01:47:53.023]  I was actually watching that on the news, and it looked like a controlled demolition to me that day.
[01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:55.691]  That was approximately when I started to wake up.
[01:47:55.751 --> 01:48:18.280]  I've been trying to wake people up up here, and it's frustrating when you think you're the only one, but it's interesting when you go into meetings with different people for, you know, just business and other related stuff, and you just, you mention something kind of cryptic about 9-11, and you see that glint in their eyes like they know what you're talking about, and you know, for the most part, you keep your mouth shut, but it's like, okay, I'm not the only one out there, and it's encouraging.
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:20.621]  Well, we can't keep our mouths shut.
[01:48:20.741 --> 01:48:23.142]  You see, everybody knows that they're keeping their mouths shut.
[01:48:24.028 --> 01:48:28.430]  I mean, major polls, scientific polls, half the American people believe the U.S.
[01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:31.392]  government carried 9-11 out.
[01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:33.313]  68% believe they're covering it up.
[01:48:34.594 --> 01:48:37.295]  So, the vast majority knows the truth now, sir.
[01:48:38.075 --> 01:48:43.678]  We are the majority, and I'll tell you, it's been in the Canadian papers that 9-11's an inside job years ago.
[01:48:44.139 --> 01:48:52.423]  Yeah, CDC released a beautiful report on Dick Cheney, and, you know, detailing that personally, you know, this is just my opinion, and it may be a little bit hyperbole,
[01:48:52.731 --> 01:48:54.072]  I think Dick Cheney's the Antichrist.
[01:48:54.453 --> 01:48:55.694]  He's not a nice guy at all.
[01:48:55.814 --> 01:48:59.357]  And the CBC released a report detailing all the stuff that he's been involved in.
[01:48:59.918 --> 01:49:02.280]  So, I mean, that was on mean TV.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:03.641]  Like, that was on the CBC.
[01:49:04.922 --> 01:49:09.186]  Well, I would just add that Dick Cheney, George Bush, they're all high-level mid-management.
[01:49:09.827 --> 01:49:11.008]  They are not the elite.
[01:49:11.729 --> 01:49:13.410]  And I do this too.
[01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:14.751]  I'm guilty of this more than anybody.
[01:49:14.811 --> 01:49:17.254]  Attacking Bush, attacking Clinton, attacking Hillary.
[01:49:18.832 --> 01:49:25.037]  At the end of the day, they can remove these people, they can remove Dick Cheney, and the same New World Order program just keeps moving forward.
[01:49:25.057 --> 01:49:27.139]  I agree completely.
[01:49:27.379 --> 01:49:28.100]  Thank you for the call.
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:28.821]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:30.002 --> 01:49:38.009]  By the way, Professor Stephen Jones did some really powerful new presentations that are extremely conclusive.
[01:49:38.049 --> 01:49:41.592]  I'll tell you about those when we get back and take more of your calls.
[01:49:42.415 --> 01:49:48.188]  And I promise next hour I'm going to get into England and these new Patsy arrests and what happened in Canada.
[01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:49.651]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:49:49.672 --> 01:49:50.213]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.789 --> 01:50:02.031]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:50:02.231 --> 01:50:04.552]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:50:05.172 --> 01:50:14.015]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:50:14.535 --> 01:50:18.236]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[01:50:18.496 --> 01:50:39.283]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:50:39.623 --> 01:50:43.364]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:50:43.824 --> 01:50:45.045]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[01:50:58.166 --> 01:51:03.611]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.891 --> 01:51:14.241]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.421 --> 01:51:18.765]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:19.065 --> 01:51:19.786]  I don't know.
[01:51:34.036 --> 01:51:38.520]  Yes, the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:55.524 --> 01:51:55.845]  I think so.
[01:52:10.763 --> 01:52:11.424]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.285 --> 01:52:43.386]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.526 --> 01:52:49.507]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:49.527 --> 01:52:57.930]  We don't need no education.
[01:53:02.951 --> 01:53:06.672]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:53:15.197 --> 01:53:18.278]  Wow, I got calls from England, Canada, all over the place.
[01:53:20.219 --> 01:53:38.728]  Just briefly, Professor Stephen Jones, they were able to get some of the molten steel from the World Trade Center that was not hauled off, that was not destroyed, because the Feds wanted to have some of it for propaganda use, so they spirited some away to warehouses for a few years, and then they have sent it out around the country
[01:53:39.879 --> 01:53:42.540]  Uh, to these different, you know, peace parks, military parks.
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:43.921]  Remember 9-11 parks?
[01:53:45.021 --> 01:53:51.384]  And there's a whole bunch of sites around the country and they've gotten samples from some of these sites, all scientifically certified.
[01:53:52.305 --> 01:54:07.454]  And Jones thought they used thermite along with some explosives, but thermite, and of course, if you put thermite on a column, you don't do it straight across because it'll just melt, and a lot of times the column's own weight will make it seal again with the column beneath it where it's been cut.
[01:54:08.014 --> 01:54:15.158]  You place these thermite cutting charges, which are patented and used, at an angle so that the column slides off.
[01:54:15.618 --> 01:54:23.244]  We have the photos of the columns, huge 4 foot columns sliced with molten steel on the outside and the inside, just on the cuts.
[01:54:23.965 --> 01:54:28.929]  They have tested the molten steel, and ladies and gentlemen, it wasn't just thermite.
[01:54:29.129 --> 01:54:32.872]  It was the particular patented type of thermite.
[01:54:33.701 --> 01:54:37.302]  Because of the different elements that were in the melted thermite.
[01:54:37.702 --> 01:54:42.444]  They know it is the exact type of thermite used for cutting, specifically columns.
[01:54:42.924 --> 01:54:44.225]  Ha ha ha!
[01:54:44.565 --> 01:54:49.506]  I mean it just gets more and more ridiculous by the millisecond.
[01:54:51.507 --> 01:54:54.068]  And we're going to try to rush in the next few weeks before we go to L.A.
[01:54:56.052 --> 01:54:56.973]  We're doing this right now.
[01:54:57.333 --> 01:54:59.474]  The raw interviews with Steven Jones.
[01:54:59.534 --> 01:55:01.495]  The raw interviews with Morgan Reynolds.
[01:55:01.515 --> 01:55:02.256]  They were incredible.
[01:55:02.636 --> 01:55:04.557]  The raw interviews with all these people.
[01:55:04.577 --> 01:55:08.819]  We're just going to put them on PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:13.062]  And I'm also going to put my entire keynote speech up for free for everybody today.
[01:55:14.082 --> 01:55:17.023]  I'm going to put sections of all those speeches up for free for everybody.
[01:55:17.383 --> 01:55:26.566]  It's just to be able to give it out for free, we have to have a lot of exclusive material for the members, who we tell the members right up front, you are financing, paying for everybody else for free, which is a good thing.
[01:55:26.867 --> 01:55:29.607]  So people who don't even know who we are can go watch these tapes and wake up.
[01:55:30.088 --> 01:55:31.348]  But then you get exclusive.
[01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:36.990]  Also, the free stuff we put up there in medium quality bandwidth, it looks decent.
[01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:39.331]  We don't put the cruddy bandwidth quality up.
[01:55:39.791 --> 01:55:41.952]  But for the members, you get the premium bandwidth
[01:55:42.913 --> 01:55:52.103]  Downloads and streams as well as medium and low for depending on your connection So another reason to be a prison planet dot TV member.
[01:55:52.684 --> 01:55:59.752]  We're also going to put up for free the Corey interview Corey robe
[01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:12.640]  From his experiences in Iraq and in Afghanistan, amazing stuff about having Bin Laden in their sights, not allowed to kill him, I mean just people in special forces units he knew told him that.
[01:56:13.021 --> 01:56:21.549]  It's been in the news, we've had colonels on to talk about it, but here's an eyewitness from Afghanistan and about some of the, where they massacred civilians and some other important things.
[01:56:22.576 --> 01:56:23.817]  that are coming up.
[01:56:24.117 --> 01:56:26.618]  I guess you really shouldn't call it a massacre.
[01:56:27.098 --> 01:56:28.499]  They were massacred.
[01:56:28.699 --> 01:56:29.779]  That is, killed in mass.
[01:56:30.219 --> 01:56:33.561]  But it was an accident in their case, and they ruled so.
[01:56:33.861 --> 01:56:35.761]  They didn't hide it like the Marines did.
[01:56:35.801 --> 01:56:37.822]  They didn't go in a house and kill kids at point-blank range.
[01:56:38.142 --> 01:56:42.724]  Somebody shot, it was celebratory, and they mowed down a big convoy.
[01:56:42.744 --> 01:56:45.025]  And that's an everyday occurrence there.
[01:56:45.505 --> 01:56:49.267]  And that's why Corey wanted to, for the first time ever, speak to our cameras on that.
[01:56:50.786 --> 01:56:51.106]  I don't know.
[01:56:51.146 --> 01:56:52.467]  I say 45-50 hours.
[01:56:52.507 --> 01:56:53.868]  I think it's close to 50 hours.
[01:56:53.888 --> 01:56:58.211]  I mean, I know we used almost... we brought 50 tapes and we only got a few left.
[01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:00.993]  I haven't counted it up exactly.
[01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:05.956]  It's like I say, we've got a thousand tickets available for our 9-11 conference that's coming up.
[01:57:06.256 --> 01:57:10.339]  Really, we can sell more than that, but then it gets a little uncomfortable, so I probably won't.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:13.181]  The tickets are going quickly, by the way.
[01:57:13.241 --> 01:57:18.444]  You want to get them now at InfoWars.com, our big 9-11 conference, coming up June 24th and 25th.
[01:57:20.447 --> 01:57:30.931]  Alright, when we get back I'm told that John disagrees with me so he'll go to the head of the line and we'll talk to Paul and London, England and many others.
[01:57:33.412 --> 01:57:38.294]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.091 --> 01:57:54.272]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.932 --> 01:57:55.752]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.512 --> 01:57:57.413]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.433 --> 01:58:01.834]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.254 --> 01:58:06.355]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.035 --> 01:58:15.977]  Professor Stephen Jones at BYU is now working with several other physicists and engineers at his university to have conclusively proven
[01:58:17.157 --> 01:58:19.239]  A special type of demolition thermite.
[01:58:19.259 --> 01:58:21.160]  This is just thermite they discovered in samples.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.641]  They were able to obtain.
[01:58:22.901 --> 01:58:26.664]  It's the byproducts of the thermite used for cutting.
[01:58:26.984 --> 01:58:28.145]  We'll tell you more about that in the shower.
[01:58:28.165 --> 01:58:36.590]  I'm going to have Kevin Smith in the studio in about 10 minutes to talk about some personal experiences he had here in Austin this weekend with some airline pilots who he's friends with and in some cases related to.
[01:58:37.331 --> 01:58:40.093]  And then we will continue with your phone calls.
[01:58:40.113 --> 01:58:41.534]  In fact, let's do that right now.
[01:58:42.547 --> 01:58:44.408]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[01:58:44.488 --> 01:58:45.729]  John, where are you calling us from?
[01:58:46.009 --> 01:58:47.129]  I'm calling from Virginia, Alex.
[01:58:47.349 --> 01:58:48.250]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:48.550]  You bet.
[01:58:48.570 --> 01:58:49.570]  I'm told you disagree with me.
[01:58:49.610 --> 01:58:49.990]  Go ahead.
[01:58:50.351 --> 01:59:00.895]  Yes, I know it's not primarily a religious program, but I have heard you say many times about how the Bible always teaches us to stand up against evil and resist.
[01:59:00.915 --> 01:59:03.316]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[01:59:03.677 --> 01:59:08.859]  Does the Bible, hundreds of times, tell us it's our duty to stand up against evil government and evil people?
[01:59:10.545 --> 01:59:23.635]  Because you can go out of context and find one or two examples of where it says laid down to it in specific instances and that's what these churches like to do instead of ignoring the entire spectrum of the Bible.
[01:59:24.416 --> 01:59:37.767]  I listen to Jesus above all of them and he says resist not evil in chapter 5 verse 39 he says you have heard it said a tooth for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I tell you not to resist evil but whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn to him the other also.
[01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:43.318]  So he was lying then when he went in and beat the money changers with a whip?
[01:59:44.239 --> 01:59:45.161]  And overturned the tables?
[01:59:46.063 --> 01:59:47.445]  Was he lying in that verse?
[01:59:48.146 --> 01:59:48.307]  Yeah.
[01:59:49.404 --> 01:59:51.365]  So you're taking all this out of context, sir.
[01:59:51.405 --> 01:59:58.110]  You have to read the entire chapter, and I've had a bunch of expert preachers from every angle here, and theologians on this subject.
[01:59:58.150 --> 01:59:58.890]  You're flat wrong.
[01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:00.691]  I read the whole Bible.
[02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:01.151]  Okay, good.
[02:00:01.171 --> 02:00:01.752]  Well, we're supposed to.
[02:00:01.772 --> 02:00:02.152]  Okay, then.
[02:00:02.352 --> 02:00:03.093]  Okay, listen.
[02:00:03.333 --> 02:00:05.234]  Why was Paul killed then?
[02:00:05.734 --> 02:00:06.735]  Why was he put in prison?
[02:00:07.195 --> 02:00:10.417]  Why did they cut John the Baptist's head off?
[02:00:10.497 --> 02:00:14.740]  Okay, were the prophets called to confront the government and to fight the evil?
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:18.940]  If they did, they were not listening to Jesus.
[02:00:20.361 --> 02:00:21.821]  Okay, thanks for the call, man.
[02:00:22.101 --> 02:00:23.302]  I really appreciate it.
[02:00:24.762 --> 02:00:30.103]  That was a specific time when they were trying to set him up to kill him.
[02:00:30.943 --> 02:00:32.344]  This is beautiful poetry.
[02:00:32.404 --> 02:00:34.084]  This is inspired by God.
[02:00:34.524 --> 02:00:36.205]  I actually have read the Bible, sir.
[02:00:36.565 --> 02:00:37.965]  I've actually studied it, okay?
[02:00:38.505 --> 02:00:40.046]  I try to live by it as best I can.
[02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.706]  I'm not perfect, okay?
[02:00:43.784 --> 02:00:44.545]  Go to Proverbs.
[02:00:44.705 --> 02:00:45.605]  Where is it in the Bible?
[02:00:45.625 --> 02:00:52.589]  There's a time for peace, a time for war, a time to laugh, a time to cry, a time to plant, a time to sow, all of that.
[02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:56.692]  Christ does different things at different places and different times.
[02:00:56.952 --> 02:00:58.393]  There's specific lessons.
[02:00:59.113 --> 02:01:03.236]  They're trying to set Him up to kill Him over and over and over again.
[02:01:03.886 --> 02:01:07.569]  So at that one point, in fact, can one of our pastors call in?
[02:01:08.049 --> 02:01:12.052]  Can Pastor Butch Paul call in and explain it if he's out there listening?
[02:01:12.072 --> 02:01:19.598]  It's so irritating, sir, to say that John the Baptist wasn't listening to Jesus.
[02:01:20.018 --> 02:01:21.179]  What is your problem?
[02:01:23.221 --> 02:01:24.622]  I mean, Willie, what's wrong with you?
[02:01:25.642 --> 02:01:26.883]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[02:01:26.903 --> 02:01:28.344]  Of course we're supposed to fight evil.
[02:01:28.825 --> 02:01:30.366]  Of course we're supposed to expose evil.
[02:01:31.443 --> 02:01:36.706]  There is a time in the discernment, you know, be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
[02:01:38.366 --> 02:01:43.549]  There are specific times where you're not supposed to be set up and act like a fool.
[02:01:44.449 --> 02:01:48.851]  Christ in that same area talks about heaping coals of fire on your enemies.
[02:01:49.892 --> 02:01:54.274]  If the cameras are rolling and for no reason the cop breaks your jaw,
[02:01:55.106 --> 02:02:00.128]  Yeah, I have a cop with a bunch of cameras rolling out in front of a bunch of people, hauls off and hits me in the head with a billy club.
[02:02:00.688 --> 02:02:01.648]  I'm gonna own his house.
[02:02:01.708 --> 02:02:02.449]  I'm gonna own his car.
[02:02:02.489 --> 02:02:04.349]  I'm gonna sue him.
[02:02:04.389 --> 02:02:06.410]  Even if he beats the rap, he won't beat the ride.
[02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:08.811]  I'm winning by not hitting him back.
[02:02:08.831 --> 02:02:09.631]  Do you understand that?
[02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:11.432]  But I'm going to fight him.
[02:02:11.452 --> 02:02:13.593]  Do you understand that, sir?
[02:02:14.553 --> 02:02:16.794]  So, so, I mean, it must feel good to you.
[02:02:17.474 --> 02:02:19.395]  I mean, I guess America was wrong to fight Hitler.
[02:02:20.135 --> 02:02:23.036]  I guess at Jericho, the Jews shouldn't have fought.
[02:02:25.848 --> 02:02:26.389]  I don't know.
[02:02:26.409 --> 02:02:29.051]  It's so incredible what you say.
[02:02:29.652 --> 02:02:30.913]  And I know the churches teach you that.
[02:02:30.953 --> 02:02:31.914]  I understand that.
[02:02:31.934 --> 02:02:34.457]  The same church probably teaches you that George Bush is Jesus.
[02:02:34.897 --> 02:02:37.139]  George Bush is of the Lord.
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:38.441]  Fine then.
[02:02:38.521 --> 02:02:39.722]  Enjoy yourself.
[02:02:40.403 --> 02:02:41.023]  Believe it.
[02:02:41.123 --> 02:02:42.145]  Love the lie.
[02:02:42.565 --> 02:02:43.266]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.805 --> 02:02:54.073]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:02:54.273 --> 02:02:56.596]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:02:57.196 --> 02:03:06.065]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:03:06.565 --> 02:03:10.087]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:03:10.527 --> 02:03:31.316]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:03:31.636 --> 02:03:35.378]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:03:36.718 --> 02:03:54.681]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard to find information.

[02:04:34.531 --> 02:04:39.335]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:04:59.780]  I think so.
[02:05:23.712 --> 02:05:26.012]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.125 --> 02:05:55.525]  I don't want to get distracted.
[02:05:55.605 --> 02:05:56.586]  I got loads of phones.
[02:05:56.646 --> 02:05:58.446]  I got about 10 issues I want to cover.
[02:05:58.466 --> 02:06:03.067]  I want to get Kevin Smith in here to tell you a great story about something that happened to him this weekend.
[02:06:04.508 --> 02:06:13.970]  His brother's an airline pilot and he had barbeque, you know, watch TV, drink beer, whatever, for a few hours with him and they all now know about 9-11.
[02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:23.153]  So, the point is everybody's waking up, but a caller, John, calls in and he says that because Jesus said, turn the other cheek,
[02:06:24.711 --> 02:06:27.674]  That we're supposed to lay down to the government and not fight it.
[02:06:28.615 --> 02:06:32.899]  That was in a specific case at a specific time when they were trying to set him up to kill him.
[02:06:35.081 --> 02:06:39.465]  I mean, Christ does all sorts of things and at different times does different things.
[02:06:40.126 --> 02:06:43.689]  And is teaching people how to respond in certain situations.
[02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:49.595]  If you sit there and somebody for no reason right in front of people smacks you
[02:06:50.572 --> 02:06:54.493]  And then you don't rise up at certain times in your life and strike back at them.
[02:06:54.533 --> 02:06:58.214]  It actually is like keeping hot coals of fire on their head.
[02:06:58.594 --> 02:07:06.016]  But at other times, he went in and beat people upside the head with a whip and overturned tables and was physically stomping on people.
[02:07:07.057 --> 02:07:07.437]  Okay?
[02:07:07.977 --> 02:07:12.338]  That's what Christ thought of the Federal Reserve, of the money changers, of the money manipulators.
[02:07:13.682 --> 02:07:19.145]  Of the very preacher whores that sit up there in their megachurches fleecing their flocks.
[02:07:19.486 --> 02:07:27.430]  The very people that teach you to lay down to corruption and evil, sir, are the very people that Jesus Christ beat upside the head with a bullwhip.
[02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:28.271]  Okay?
[02:07:28.371 --> 02:07:29.471]  Do you understand that?
[02:07:29.972 --> 02:07:34.254]  And when you start shooting your mouth off to me here, that's what I feel like doing to you.
[02:07:34.274 --> 02:07:37.556]  And I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir.
[02:07:37.836 --> 02:07:39.337]  I'm sure you're a nice person!
[02:07:40.758 --> 02:07:42.399]  But I don't know where the courage is!
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:48.203]  Your guts have to know that that is a lie, that is a fraud.
[02:07:48.263 --> 02:07:51.945]  Your bones should cry out against these manifest frauds.
[02:07:53.386 --> 02:07:54.647]  I don't understand it.
[02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:58.910]  I don't have that high a view of myself.
[02:07:59.730 --> 02:08:00.030]  People?
[02:08:00.871 --> 02:08:03.072]  People, oh you have so much courage, oh you're so good.
[02:08:03.152 --> 02:08:04.133]  No, I'm nothing!
[02:08:05.474 --> 02:08:07.495]  We got a bunch of evil scum running this country.
[02:08:07.515 --> 02:08:08.656]  I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
[02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:13.632]  All of human history is about the struggle against tyranny.
[02:08:14.433 --> 02:08:17.656]  William Wallace, the list goes on and on.
[02:08:18.977 --> 02:08:20.098]  Our founding fathers.
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:28.324]  I mean, are you really saying that we're not allowed to fight corrupt government?
[02:08:28.344 --> 02:08:30.386]  That we're not allowed to speak out against corruption?
[02:08:30.406 --> 02:08:31.787]  That we're not supposed to?
[02:08:32.187 --> 02:08:33.789]  You claim you've read the Bible.
[02:08:34.409 --> 02:08:35.230]  No, you haven't.
[02:08:37.184 --> 02:08:45.926]  So many pastors I support, I respect, theologians that I support, and what I've read in the Word, and I'm not trying to preach here, but you called in, sir, and you kicked this off, so I'm going to say it.
[02:08:49.307 --> 02:08:53.048]  Clearly state that the Bible is to not be taken out of context.
[02:08:53.088 --> 02:08:55.329]  You are to read the whole thing together.
[02:08:55.369 --> 02:08:56.469]  It's one piece.
[02:08:57.509 --> 02:08:58.569]  It's one piece.
[02:08:59.390 --> 02:09:03.290]  And that's how you get the gist of it, and you even need discernment to understand it.
[02:09:03.731 --> 02:09:04.791]  And let me just give you a little
[02:09:06.630 --> 02:09:09.631]  Word to the wise here, sir, you are not getting it.
[02:09:09.791 --> 02:09:10.111]  Okay?
[02:09:10.131 --> 02:09:11.471]  You are not getting it.
[02:09:11.531 --> 02:09:12.972]  I mean, I challenge you, sir.
[02:09:14.752 --> 02:09:17.233]  Randomly open your Bible five times.
[02:09:17.533 --> 02:09:19.853]  Because it may not happen the first time, but to me it always does.
[02:09:19.913 --> 02:09:21.494]  But randomly open it.
[02:09:21.734 --> 02:09:23.614]  I think the whole thing is about fighting evil.
[02:09:23.914 --> 02:09:26.875]  The whole thing is about standing up against adversity and having courage.
[02:09:27.075 --> 02:09:30.116]  The whole thing is about resisting tyranny in different ways.
[02:09:31.096 --> 02:09:35.517]  And see, you missed the lesson Christ was giving you, God was giving you, right there.
[02:09:39.528 --> 02:09:42.049]  I just can't even... It's so incredible.
[02:09:42.329 --> 02:09:46.632]  I just can't even... You people have got me gibbering.
[02:09:46.752 --> 02:09:48.613]  I mean, you've got me babbling here.
[02:09:49.374 --> 02:09:58.780]  I don't even have words to describe what a manifest patent fraud the statement that we're supposed to lay down to government is.
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:01.501]  It is not true!
[02:10:06.641 --> 02:10:10.642]  No wonder we're in so much trouble, and I know good and well the churches, most of them teach this.
[02:10:12.622 --> 02:10:19.183]  It was the churches that led this country into the Revolutionary War against the Redcoats, and it's the churches that are now killing this country.
[02:10:21.084 --> 02:10:24.224]  Lay down, don't get involved, don't protest, don't demonstrate.
[02:10:24.665 --> 02:10:27.605]  There's even some Christian churches that say, don't go out and protest abortion!
[02:10:29.685 --> 02:10:32.146]  Don't go out and criticize abortion, it's not our job!
[02:10:34.679 --> 02:10:36.800]  And I'm sorry, I feel violent towards you people.
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:39.040]  In fact, you make me madder than the New World Order.
[02:10:39.381 --> 02:10:45.202]  The New World Order is evil, they're sick, they're degenerate, but at least we know what they are, and at least they're pure to what they are.
[02:10:45.242 --> 02:10:51.084]  In fact, Christ said this, you were neither hot nor cold, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:10:51.384 --> 02:10:56.426]  God hates you when you sit on the fence and stick your thumb in your mouth.
[02:10:58.427 --> 02:10:59.487]  You're lukewarm.
[02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:03.288]  And lukewarm is the most dangerous?
[02:11:03.308 --> 02:11:04.708]  You don't want to be in the middle of the road.
[02:11:04.728 --> 02:11:06.189]  You want to be in one lane or the other.
[02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:09.990]  Oh, even Anton LaVey said that.
[02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:11.811]  Even the Satanists have figured this out.
[02:11:14.652 --> 02:11:16.072]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:11:16.092 --> 02:11:19.774]  Yeah, the Satanists laugh at people that are in the middle of the road.
[02:11:20.474 --> 02:11:22.415]  They talk about how they're the ones that are in the greatest danger.
[02:11:22.715 --> 02:11:23.975]  And I'll tell you right now, it's true.
[02:11:27.217 --> 02:11:30.858]  And I don't even feel like... Just that phone call made me so sick.
[02:11:32.288 --> 02:11:33.069]  So sick!
[02:11:33.149 --> 02:11:34.630]  I don't even feel like doing this show right now.
[02:11:35.190 --> 02:11:39.874]  I went from being in a good mood to just tapping into that weakness.
[02:11:40.414 --> 02:11:48.760]  Having to look at it makes me want to vomit because I expend every ounce of energy I've got.
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:49.621]  I work really hard.
[02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:54.284]  I miss seeing my children to fight this thing because I know that it's my job to fight it.
[02:11:54.304 --> 02:11:55.305]  It's our duty to do it.
[02:11:55.665 --> 02:11:56.826]  I know we can have an effect.
[02:11:57.246 --> 02:11:59.288]  All God wants is for us to stand in the gap
[02:12:00.203 --> 02:12:04.945]  Even when it looks like we're going to lose, and then he will bless us, he will come in, he will give us the divine providence.
[02:12:05.725 --> 02:12:10.187]  And I look at our founding fathers and all the great men and women that came before us that stood up for what was right.
[02:12:10.988 --> 02:12:12.208]  Many of them lost their lives.
[02:12:12.868 --> 02:12:28.555]  And to see what Americans have turned into, the majority of the so-called Christian conservatives, they think George Bush is a Christian, they think George Bush is good, they think what he's doing is conservative, they think worshiping world government is conservative, they think we're supposed to follow the orders of the government,
[02:12:31.067 --> 02:12:34.068]  I mean, if the government told them to take a microchip right now, they'd do it!
[02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:45.772]  You know, a lot of the Christian churches are teaching that Jesus is going to be a political leader, and will soon be arriving to rule from the Middle East, and that he will soon be ruling us?
[02:12:49.013 --> 02:12:52.294]  The Bible says that's what the Antichrist is going to do, and they're already teaching it!
[02:12:52.554 --> 02:12:54.635]  They already worship Antichrist and don't even know it!
[02:12:55.663 --> 02:13:01.627]  And, you know, I'll tell the atheists and others, if you don't believe in God, you don't believe in the devil, you don't believe in any of this stuff, whatever.
[02:13:02.448 --> 02:13:03.829]  You know, that's at your own peril.
[02:13:04.129 --> 02:13:07.552]  The point is, is that the elite do believe in it and they are following it, okay?
[02:13:07.852 --> 02:13:08.432]  I've been there.
[02:13:08.492 --> 02:13:09.513]  I've been at their encampments.
[02:13:09.553 --> 02:13:10.394]  I've snuck into it.
[02:13:10.734 --> 02:13:11.274]  I've seen it.
[02:13:11.534 --> 02:13:12.595]  You know about Skull and Bones.
[02:13:12.615 --> 02:13:13.696]  You know about Bohemian Grove.
[02:13:14.617 --> 02:13:16.838]  The elite really does believe it's spiritual.
[02:13:16.858 --> 02:13:17.759]  They know it's spiritual.
[02:13:18.019 --> 02:13:22.022]  So, at least from a psychological perspective, you should investigate that to understand how they tick.
[02:13:23.607 --> 02:13:30.530]  And they think they're bringing in, like, liberals think Bush really is a Christian and that he's nuts and wants to bring in Armageddon because he's a Christian.
[02:13:30.970 --> 02:13:35.012]  No, folks, he's nuts and wants to bring in Armageddon because he's a devil worshipper.
[02:13:35.412 --> 02:13:36.973]  And the actual evidence shows that.
[02:13:37.333 --> 02:13:41.114]  I don't mean him on Sunday down at the local church for a photo-op once a month.
[02:13:41.755 --> 02:13:47.337]  I mean George W. Bush really attends satanic meetings.
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:56.341]  And I have these so-called Christians march up to me all the time and go, Alex, bohemian robe isn't that bad, skull and bones isn't that bad, they're just having fun.
[02:13:56.861 --> 02:14:05.023]  Folks, I guarantee you, I get seen on a videotape drinking a beer six years ago or smoking a cigarette and some people freak out over it.
[02:14:05.803 --> 02:14:07.123]  Not that I've ever tried to hide it.
[02:14:08.783 --> 02:14:11.264]  And that's bad and Alex is evil and he's of the devil.
[02:14:11.504 --> 02:14:16.885]  But man, George Bush can dress up in black cloaks and do mock baby murder, and man, it's good!
[02:14:17.685 --> 02:14:30.735]  Man, he's just blowing off... I mean, I would expect folks, if I get caught on tape in a black robe, engaging in mock baby murder, that the police come by and investigate me, much less have Christians going around going, Alex Jones is a devil!
[02:14:31.015 --> 02:14:31.856]  He's a liar!
[02:14:31.976 --> 02:14:36.640]  National Christian talk shows routinely get up and say, I am a liar!
[02:14:38.181 --> 02:14:42.104]  First, five years ago, Skull and Bones doesn't exist, Alex is a liar, Bush isn't a member.
[02:14:42.524 --> 02:14:44.846]  Now it's okay to exist, but it's just fraternity fun.
[02:14:46.215 --> 02:14:58.919]  And then ask your preacher when he says that, okay preacher, so it's okay for me to worship Eulogia, the goddess, and to worship another death goddess, and have skulls, and Hitler's silverware, and Nazi flags, and a thing called the tomb?
[02:14:59.559 --> 02:15:00.380]  Is that okay?
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:02.320]  Is that okay?
[02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:04.121]  I mean, ask him that!
[02:15:04.901 --> 02:15:05.501]  Is it good?
[02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:09.543]  Alright, I'm settling down.
[02:15:15.094 --> 02:15:16.754]  I'm trying to control myself here is what's happening.
[02:15:17.315 --> 02:15:18.235]  Who's up next here?
[02:15:20.255 --> 02:15:22.056]  Paul in London, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:15:23.036 --> 02:15:23.816]  Good morning Alex.
[02:15:23.996 --> 02:15:24.256]  Hi.
[02:15:24.736 --> 02:15:27.317]  I'm a GCN subscriber and a Prison Planet member as well.
[02:15:27.537 --> 02:15:27.917]  Thank you.
[02:15:29.377 --> 02:15:36.379]  I know things are desperate as they are right now, but is there any chance that there's a highly placed 5th columnist within the New World Order?
[02:15:37.159 --> 02:15:38.159]  These 5 to midnight
[02:15:40.177 --> 02:15:47.043]  Yes, there are Fifth Columnists for Freedom all over TV, all over radio, all over the systems.
[02:15:47.223 --> 02:15:49.024]  I talk to them and they can't fake it.
[02:15:49.064 --> 02:15:50.325]  They're like, we know it's true.
[02:15:50.565 --> 02:15:51.786]  We know, Alex, we're trying.
[02:15:53.568 --> 02:15:54.909]  Please don't tell anyone I told you.
[02:15:55.569 --> 02:15:56.370]  I can get fired!
[02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:57.991]  I mean, all the time.
[02:15:58.111 --> 02:16:00.994]  CNN, New York Times, Fox TV.
[02:16:02.075 --> 02:16:03.296]  Just all of them.
[02:16:04.116 --> 02:16:04.557]  Cops.
[02:16:05.299 --> 02:16:13.742]  I mean, like half the cops in Chicago, there'd be 50 of them around us at the demonstration, and I'd be saying, you know, 9-11's an inside job, and they'd smile and nod.
[02:16:14.482 --> 02:16:20.044]  And a cop would walk up on the subway and go, look, I'm supposed to tell you not to videotape down here, but... Is your camera off?
[02:16:20.144 --> 02:16:20.704]  He sees it's off.
[02:16:21.045 --> 02:16:21.845]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:16:22.625 --> 02:16:23.285]  I mean, look!
[02:16:25.566 --> 02:16:27.727]  We ought to thank God people are waking up here!
[02:16:29.332 --> 02:16:30.113]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[02:16:30.133 --> 02:16:32.655]  I didn't know that Pope John Paul II made those pronouncements.
[02:16:32.675 --> 02:16:37.580]  I know he said that, I mean, Ratzinger saying we have a satanic society, but he ought to know
[02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:53.051]  I'm not a supporter of Ratzinger.
[02:16:54.172 --> 02:16:58.415]  I'm not a Catholic basher either, but I am not a supporter of Ratzinger.
[02:16:58.676 --> 02:17:00.037]  He just called for a New World Order.
[02:17:02.619 --> 02:17:03.499]  What's your view on that?
[02:17:06.181 --> 02:17:07.442]  I'm sorry, can you repeat that last?
[02:17:08.043 --> 02:17:08.523]  Ratzinger?
[02:17:08.743 --> 02:17:11.666]  What's your view on Ratzinger calling for a One World Government?
[02:17:13.247 --> 02:17:13.847]  Oh, God no.
[02:17:14.008 --> 02:17:14.488]  Definitely not.
[02:17:15.095 --> 02:17:20.739]  Um, living in the UK, I can tell you that, um, I feel like I'm living under totalitarian state now.
[02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:21.419]  Stay there.
[02:17:21.439 --> 02:17:33.567]  We'll come back and let you finish up, then we'll go to, uh... We'll go to Paul in Canada, Chris in Arkansas, Bobby in California, and many, many others.
[02:17:33.587 --> 02:17:34.028]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:34.048 --> 02:17:40.332]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm gonna get Kevin here, and then I'm gonna get into, uh, a little bit on this England stuff, and then...
[02:17:40.794 --> 02:17:42.655]  It's a Canadian fake terror roundup.
[02:17:42.715 --> 02:17:44.715]  It's just total baloney.
[02:17:46.816 --> 02:17:50.097]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:17:50.597 --> 02:17:52.738]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[02:17:53.258 --> 02:17:58.640]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[02:18:46.013 --> 02:18:46.453]  Gold.
[02:18:46.793 --> 02:18:48.073]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:48.333 --> 02:18:54.415]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:54.615 --> 02:18:58.436]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:58.776 --> 02:19:00.676]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:00.716 --> 02:19:03.016]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:03.157 --> 02:19:10.538]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:19:10.578 --> 02:19:11.559]  We're good to go.
[02:19:28.848 --> 02:19:29.128]  We're good.
[02:19:48.885 --> 02:19:53.067]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:53.307 --> 02:19:56.089]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:56.289 --> 02:19:58.691]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:58.871 --> 02:20:07.536]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:07.716 --> 02:20:09.077]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:20:09.257 --> 02:20:13.439]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:13.659 --> 02:20:14.179]  We're good to go!
[02:20:32.688 --> 02:20:34.009]  Gas prices are out of control.
[02:20:34.049 --> 02:20:37.091]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[02:20:37.271 --> 02:20:40.874]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[02:20:40.914 --> 02:20:43.997]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using the
[02:21:01.570 --> 02:21:02.851]  We're good to go.
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:25.083]  Yes, MPG caps are designed for use in all gasoline or diesel powered engines.
[02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:31.468]  And you can also have a lucrative home-based business by simply sharing this amazing, money-saving product with others.
[02:21:31.628 --> 02:21:32.148]  Don't wait!
[02:21:32.268 --> 02:21:34.009]  Call MPG Biz now at 800-526-1778.
[02:21:34.069 --> 02:21:34.250]  That's 800-526-1778.
[02:21:34.310 --> 02:21:36.431]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:36.531 --> 02:21:36.991]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:48.792 --> 02:21:51.273]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:21:51.813 --> 02:21:54.554]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.694 --> 02:21:57.115]  That's right, history's documented.
[02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.956]  Evil always falls at its own weight and degeneracy.
[02:22:00.856 --> 02:22:02.957]  So don't worry, it's documented.
[02:22:03.417 --> 02:22:04.097]  We're gonna win.
[02:22:04.117 --> 02:22:06.498]  Let's move quickly here.
[02:22:07.038 --> 02:22:08.739]  Paul in London, then I'm gonna go to Paul in Canada.
[02:22:08.779 --> 02:22:09.639]  Finish up what you were saying?
[02:22:10.219 --> 02:22:15.321]  I was just gonna say that living in the UK now is increasingly difficult.
[02:22:15.681 --> 02:22:17.442]  The government we have, led by Blair,
[02:22:17.975 --> 02:22:20.035]  It just makes it feel like a totalitarian state.
[02:22:20.236 --> 02:22:25.557]  And understand what we ended the last segment with, they'll put somebody else in new, and it'll be the exact same thing.
[02:22:25.577 --> 02:22:32.978]  That's why you've got to attack the corrupt system itself in the public's mind, or they'll keep just replacing it with retreads.
[02:22:32.998 --> 02:22:33.698]  But here's the key.
[02:22:34.299 --> 02:22:38.099]  You go protest the national ID card, the cops come over and enroll you in a database.
[02:22:38.179 --> 02:22:39.120]  It happened to me over there.
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:41.020]  I mean, you are living in a police state.
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:45.221]  Yeah, we're not even, it's even frowned upon to fly our national flag.
[02:22:46.041 --> 02:22:50.303]  Now, in America, I believe that people can still fly the national flag without any problem.
[02:22:50.403 --> 02:22:56.367]  Over here, people look at you as being an extreme right-wing synthesizer, and it's just outrageous.
[02:22:56.407 --> 02:22:59.348]  And it's been like this for possibly about 15 years, 20 years.
[02:22:59.368 --> 02:23:00.889]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[02:23:00.909 --> 02:23:08.213]  Sir, sir, I remember when I was living in an apartment, back when it was evil to fly the American flag under Clinton,
[02:23:09.011 --> 02:23:10.132]  And people thought it was weird.
[02:23:10.172 --> 02:23:11.333]  The news said it was strange.
[02:23:12.113 --> 02:23:12.794]  Movies did.
[02:23:12.814 --> 02:23:14.115]  I would fly it.
[02:23:14.175 --> 02:23:16.557]  As soon as 9-11 happened, I took our flag down.
[02:23:17.417 --> 02:23:20.700]  And my girlfriend came over, now my wife, and said, why have you taken the flag down?
[02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:22.601]  Why are you saying we shouldn't burn candles?
[02:23:22.981 --> 02:23:25.183]  And I said, they're now expropriated the flag.
[02:23:25.523 --> 02:23:28.846]  First they destroy the flag and take it away from those of us it belongs to.
[02:23:29.346 --> 02:23:31.868]  Then they take it back and say it's now a symbol of tyranny.
[02:23:32.168 --> 02:23:34.590]  So when you fly it, that means you're agreeing with them.
[02:23:35.319 --> 02:23:39.481]  So yes, I have talked to Brits over there where it's looked down on to fly your own flag.
[02:23:39.641 --> 02:23:40.881]  All of you should fly your flag!
[02:23:41.101 --> 02:23:41.621]  Absolutely.
[02:23:42.622 --> 02:23:49.504]  You mentioned the Enabling Act last week, and we have this new law here called Incitement to Racial Hatred, which pretty much governs anything.
[02:23:50.004 --> 02:23:56.227]  Anyone that wants to object to a certain part of government policy in the UK, they just put this in their face, Incitement to Racial Hatred.
[02:23:56.567 --> 02:24:02.049]  Sir, they've arrested BBC reporters for saying farmers deserve the same rights as gays.
[02:24:02.862 --> 02:24:05.343]  And they said that that isn't allowed.
[02:24:05.923 --> 02:24:07.203]  They just didn't like what he said.
[02:24:07.223 --> 02:24:08.463]  He wasn't even criticizing them.
[02:24:08.763 --> 02:24:09.684]  And so he was arrested.
[02:24:11.044 --> 02:24:11.784]  Robin Page.
[02:24:13.104 --> 02:24:13.805]  Yes, I remember that.
[02:24:14.685 --> 02:24:16.045]  Well, I have a BBC headline.
[02:24:16.385 --> 02:24:18.566]  Hundreds arrested nightly in hate raids.
[02:24:18.866 --> 02:24:28.388]  If your neighbor hears you say a profane word about some other group, which I don't agree with, folks, but I'll fight the death for you to have that right to say it, they arrest you.
[02:24:30.097 --> 02:24:35.342]  But it actually, I feel, I truly feel like a third class citizen in my own country.
[02:24:36.764 --> 02:24:40.908]  I know, they're just pumping in more foreigners, and they don't tell them to get rid of their culture, do they?
[02:24:41.889 --> 02:24:42.229]  Uh, no.
[02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:49.536]  Yeah, as soon as your culture, Anglo-Saxon, isn't dominant, it'll be okay to promote yours, then they'll attack whoever the newest big group is.
[02:24:49.857 --> 02:24:51.799]  They attack whoever is the strongest.
[02:24:52.816 --> 02:24:53.576]  That's all they do.
[02:24:53.636 --> 02:24:54.297]  Thank you for the call.
[02:24:54.677 --> 02:24:56.657]  They want to take your identity away from you.
[02:24:56.977 --> 02:24:58.838]  Hey, if you're Mexican, keep your identity.
[02:24:58.898 --> 02:24:59.238]  Love it.
[02:24:59.298 --> 02:24:59.758]  Cherish it.
[02:24:59.778 --> 02:25:00.199]  It's great.
[02:25:00.219 --> 02:25:02.119]  If you're white, keep your identity.
[02:25:02.159 --> 02:25:02.459]  Love it.
[02:25:02.479 --> 02:25:02.980]  Cherish it.
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:03.420]  It's great.
[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:05.040]  If you're black, keep your identity.
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:05.360]  Love it.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:05.901]  Cherish it.
[02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:06.321]  It's great.
[02:25:06.741 --> 02:25:08.621]  If you're Japanese, be proud of your history.
[02:25:09.282 --> 02:25:11.182]  None of us should be ashamed of who we are.
[02:25:12.123 --> 02:25:13.743]  It's like when you got a Basset Hound.
[02:25:13.783 --> 02:25:15.644]  It's not bad to go, I like Basset Hounds.
[02:25:15.924 --> 02:25:17.324]  Basset Hounds are neat dogs.
[02:25:17.785 --> 02:25:19.485]  It doesn't mean you hate German Shepherds.
[02:25:20.986 --> 02:25:21.666]  It's just sick.
[02:25:22.347 --> 02:25:28.491]  They don't want any of us to have identity other than having identity with your favorite sitcom!
[02:25:29.912 --> 02:25:32.153]  Well, I'm sorry, that's not my identity!
[02:25:35.655 --> 02:25:37.616]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:25:37.657 --> 02:25:38.837]  Thank you for the call from England.
[02:25:38.877 --> 02:25:40.298]  Paul in Canada.
[02:25:40.318 --> 02:25:42.039]  We're getting more calls from Canada than the U.S.
[02:25:42.059 --> 02:25:42.379]  today.
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:43.740]  Paul, what's on your mind?
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:45.261]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:45.501 --> 02:25:46.442]  I called in last week.
[02:25:46.842 --> 02:25:51.325]  I was asking about the North American Union and about the capital being Atlanta.
[02:25:51.955 --> 02:25:53.435]  I've been searching everywhere on Google.
[02:25:53.495 --> 02:25:55.056]  I'm trying to find a citation.
[02:25:55.076 --> 02:25:56.376]  I need a citation.
[02:25:56.436 --> 02:25:57.456]  Number one, let me stop you.
[02:25:57.856 --> 02:26:02.137]  Did you find all the Canadian news articles about Canadian sovereignty going away?
[02:26:02.177 --> 02:26:02.978]  American Union?
[02:26:04.158 --> 02:26:05.838]  Um, I haven't found those.
[02:26:05.938 --> 02:26:10.759]  I checked the SPP.gov website and the links from there, and there's a lot of good information.
[02:26:10.779 --> 02:26:12.420]  Well, I mean, there's the official CFR.
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:13.340]  You've got Lou Dobbs.
[02:26:13.700 --> 02:26:18.281]  The only reason I say that is no one's covered it like Canada.
[02:26:18.301 --> 02:26:21.222]  Canada's come right out and said they're merging with the U.S., so I don't
[02:26:22.358 --> 02:26:24.579]  In like Globe and Mail, Toronto Star.
[02:26:25.079 --> 02:26:26.859]  So I'm confused.
[02:26:27.539 --> 02:26:29.180]  I haven't tried to do the search yet.
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:30.180]  My laptop's gone in there.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:31.180]  I haven't unpacked it yet.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.321]  I'm getting home last night at 10 o'clock.
[02:26:34.161 --> 02:26:35.622]  So, I mean, it's there, sir.
[02:26:35.662 --> 02:26:36.622]  You can go check it out.
[02:26:37.362 --> 02:26:41.023]  Okay, well, here in Vancouver, they're totally oblivious to what's going on.
[02:26:41.043 --> 02:26:49.305]  I mean, they have no idea that Harper's a globalist and he's basically out to merge the North American Union.
[02:26:49.795 --> 02:26:51.356]  You know, or he's trying to create the union.
[02:26:51.736 --> 02:26:59.259]  And I want to raise the issue with the local talk show host here, but I just need a little backup and more information and that's why... I understand.
[02:26:59.279 --> 02:27:03.600]  This is probably the 10th question, where's this, where's that today, and we'll try to provide those.
[02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:08.062]  I got both my guys in there uploading video right now of the conference.
[02:27:08.642 --> 02:27:12.244]  The problem is we don't have enough money to hire enough people to answer and do everything.
[02:27:12.724 --> 02:27:15.025]  Because it would take about 20 minutes for us to find all the links,
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.100]  And repost them on the main page.
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:21.942]  I've told Paul Watson to create an American Union page on Prison Planet.
[02:27:22.762 --> 02:27:30.184]  He's busy, uh, writing a book, and doing all the other customer service, and writing articles, and updating the three websites.
[02:27:30.984 --> 02:27:32.664]  But we'll try to provide it for you, sir.
[02:27:33.445 --> 02:27:34.565]  I can find it in two seconds.
[02:27:36.025 --> 02:27:36.925]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.426 --> 02:27:39.026]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.946 --> 02:27:42.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.179 --> 02:27:48.000]  Come on, Bill.
[02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:50.040]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:53.402]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:27:53.742 --> 02:27:54.302]  What did you do?
[02:27:54.402 --> 02:27:55.242]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:27:55.322 --> 02:27:56.043]  No, John.
[02:27:56.123 --> 02:27:57.303]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:27:57.583 --> 02:28:03.085]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:03.385 --> 02:28:09.648]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:28:09.968 --> 02:28:12.189]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:14.029]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:16.570]  Whoa!
[02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:18.131]  What was that website again?
[02:28:18.211 --> 02:28:21.692]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:21.992 --> 02:28:23.112]  Now write this down, John.
[02:28:23.232 --> 02:28:27.554]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:28:27.694 --> 02:28:28.274]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:28:28.554 --> 02:28:29.754]  I'm going there right now.
[02:28:30.154 --> 02:28:30.835]  Check, please.
[02:28:32.615 --> 02:28:34.055]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:28:34.536 --> 02:28:35.116]  Sure, John.
[02:28:35.356 --> 02:28:39.717]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:40.017 --> 02:28:41.698]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:28:41.878 --> 02:28:42.118]  Deal.
[02:28:43.829 --> 02:28:45.450]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:45.570 --> 02:28:49.691]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:49.811 --> 02:28:52.692]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:52.772 --> 02:28:59.454]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:28:59.674 --> 02:28:59.794]  Yes!
[02:29:15.734 --> 02:29:24.861]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:29:25.021 --> 02:29:32.807]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:32.847 --> 02:29:33.227]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:33.307 --> 02:29:34.969]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:43.465 --> 02:29:49.848]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:50.149 --> 02:29:54.811]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency technology.
[02:29:55.151 --> 02:30:02.695]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.

[02:30:32.685 --> 02:30:33.025]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.066 --> 02:30:33.906]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:55.118 --> 02:31:19.786]  We're back live here.
[02:31:19.806 --> 02:31:22.687]  I wanted to have Kevin Smith in the studio, but people come in my studio.
[02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:27.732]  When I'm not here and they unplug things, so now the other microphone isn't even hooked up in here.
[02:31:28.213 --> 02:31:28.933]  I didn't even know that.
[02:31:29.373 --> 02:31:32.355]  I'd walk him in there to come on air and it's just unhooked.
[02:31:32.375 --> 02:31:33.836]  That's how things go around my office.
[02:31:34.876 --> 02:31:38.638]  It's just the unending hassles that we deal with here.
[02:31:38.798 --> 02:31:40.259]  I'm not going to whine or gripe about it.
[02:31:41.079 --> 02:31:43.141]  It's just par for the course around here.
[02:31:43.161 --> 02:31:51.225]  You know, speak of the devil, I could do a lot more work and get a lot more done the more I think about it if I had more people here.
[02:31:52.754 --> 02:31:58.996]  The problem is the kind of work we do is not profitable in the realm of money in most cases.
[02:32:00.116 --> 02:32:06.738]  That is, we can put a video up on the web and have a million people watch it, but then maybe five people out of that million buy it.
[02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:15.001]  And the profit to me is getting the word out, and that's what I enjoy, so that's why I like to do it.
[02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:16.381]  We know it's having an effect.
[02:32:17.969 --> 02:32:25.791]  But at the same time, I don't have the employees right now, or I would load about 30 hours of this 50 hours onto PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:26.892 --> 02:32:32.313]  I'd put it out for free on the web for everybody, but then we couldn't pay for the bandwidth.
[02:32:32.433 --> 02:32:41.696]  So, you know, it's catch-22s, catch-22s at every step of the way along the line here.
[02:32:42.576 --> 02:32:46.237]  So I will encourage the listeners here, I guess just once during this broadcast,
[02:32:47.972 --> 02:32:51.615]  To not wait, to not sit idly by, to support us.
[02:32:51.975 --> 02:32:54.677]  I don't ask you to send me donations like so many other people do.
[02:32:56.038 --> 02:32:59.601]  All I ask you to do is to support us by getting our films.
[02:32:59.701 --> 02:33:02.183]  And then that way you know your money is going into something good.
[02:33:02.983 --> 02:33:13.071]  Some of the profit from that will go to run the operation, to make future films, but more importantly you'll have a video in your hand, a DVD, that can wake up friends and family, neighbors, people in your community.
[02:33:14.721 --> 02:33:17.922]  And I want to thank those that have supported us, but we really need your support now.
[02:33:17.982 --> 02:33:18.822]  We need to expand.
[02:33:18.862 --> 02:33:21.062]  We need to do a lot more, a lot faster.
[02:33:21.102 --> 02:33:22.783]  We're having huge effects.
[02:33:23.483 --> 02:33:26.964]  We're having a huge effect with what we're doing today.
[02:33:28.344 --> 02:33:29.004]  We're able to.
[02:33:31.164 --> 02:33:34.125]  But if we could expand what we were doing, we could do so much more.
[02:33:34.165 --> 02:33:38.246]  We could put out films faster and better and reach more people.
[02:33:39.568 --> 02:33:44.610]  Not just because they're good videos, but because it also supports us in our entire operation against the globalists.

[02:34:01.516 --> 02:34:06.317]  I don't care what you do, just get them, buy one copy, make copies of them.
[02:34:06.397 --> 02:34:07.678]  It's having an effect.
[02:34:08.695 --> 02:34:13.199]  We are reaping a massive, massive harvest here.
[02:34:13.299 --> 02:34:19.804]  We're actually hurting the New World Order, but it's not fast enough, it's not big enough.
[02:34:20.624 --> 02:34:23.146]  And I know we're at the tip of the spear here, there's no debating it.
[02:34:23.607 --> 02:34:29.231]  So please visit InfoWars.com and order as many of the videos and books as you can afford and give them to people.

[02:35:00.453 --> 02:35:09.034]  If you have any questions about the films or about the conference that is coming up in just 19 days in Los Angeles.
[02:35:11.175 --> 02:35:16.496]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to your calls here.
[02:35:19.236 --> 02:35:21.077]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris.
[02:35:22.537 --> 02:35:24.418]  Chris, you're calling us from where?
[02:35:24.938 --> 02:35:26.138]  Little Rock, Arkansas, Alex.
[02:35:27.526 --> 02:35:30.888]  Hey Alex, I'm a former paratrooper.
[02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:34.471]  I'm a current member of the Arkansas Army National Guard.
[02:35:34.611 --> 02:35:49.240]  I'm in the aviation unit and I'm a former atheist also and I converted over to Christianity about three or four years ago but I did a pretty intense study of the Bible and it was interesting that caller that called in earlier.
[02:35:50.341 --> 02:35:54.624]  One of the big things that kept me from becoming a Christian was kind of
[02:35:55.034 --> 02:36:00.075]  This perception that I have of Christians being weak because they would not stand up to government.
[02:36:00.695 --> 02:36:05.456]  And they use passages like Romans 13 to kind of bow down to government tyranny.
[02:36:06.176 --> 02:36:07.116]  And I've studied the Bible.
[02:36:07.156 --> 02:36:09.117]  I went to Bible college for several years.
[02:36:09.497 --> 02:36:13.658]  And it's filled with civil disobedience.
[02:36:14.538 --> 02:36:15.938]  It's all through the scriptures.
[02:36:16.578 --> 02:36:18.439]  And I don't understand it either, Alex.
[02:36:18.499 --> 02:36:24.180]  And I get angry with people at my church about it too because I'm trying to get this idea through their head.
[02:36:25.017 --> 02:36:26.638]  That it's God that's sovereign.
[02:36:26.658 --> 02:36:30.599]  Look, it's a rationale for them to be lazy and do nothing.
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:32.420]  That's all it is.
[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:35.081]  They want to believe a lie, so they believe it.
[02:36:35.702 --> 02:36:37.943]  Well, it's more comfortable to believe a lie.
[02:36:38.683 --> 02:36:42.405]  Well, it's comfortable for a while until that lie comes home to roost.
[02:36:42.805 --> 02:36:44.426]  Right, exactly.
[02:36:44.446 --> 02:36:47.807]  But I think even within Romans 13 itself, it clearly says, like in verse 3,
[02:36:52.976 --> 02:36:57.019]  Rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil.
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:12.630]  I mean, the clear implication there is that if you're walking around in society and you're trying to live a godly life, and your government is punishing you, and you're having to fear your government, even though you're not committing evil acts, that means your government's corrupt.
[02:37:13.851 --> 02:37:17.733]  And that's not right, because government is under the dominion of God.
[02:37:18.854 --> 02:37:21.336]  I think it's being flipped around in our country.
[02:37:21.966 --> 02:37:29.028]  We're putting the government above God, and the government is under God and is established by God to punish evildoers.
[02:37:29.128 --> 02:37:39.091]  And when it starts punishing innocent people, you know, in my mind, from my theological standpoint, it's lost its authority at that point.
[02:37:39.451 --> 02:37:45.773]  It's usurping the purpose for which God has established and ordained it, and that is to punish evil.
[02:37:46.133 --> 02:37:48.313]  So, I mean, I agree with you.
[02:37:49.014 --> 02:37:49.594]  You know, Alex,
[02:37:50.666 --> 02:37:58.388]  That attitude is prevalent, and it's scary, and it's the vast majority of people in the churches, at least from my vantage point, from what I see.
[02:37:59.488 --> 02:38:05.149]  But there's so many things in the Constitution that come from the Bible.
[02:38:05.289 --> 02:38:10.510]  You know, the concept of the militia... Look, laying down to tyranny in government is not in the Bible.
[02:38:11.290 --> 02:38:14.291]  And they can take one or two statements and try to misconstrue them, or
[02:38:15.843 --> 02:38:20.284]  And of course, always in those very chapters, it will explain what it really means, but they don't want that.
[02:38:20.504 --> 02:38:21.384]  They want to be slaves!
[02:38:21.444 --> 02:38:21.684]  Let them!
[02:38:21.704 --> 02:38:22.204]  They're scum!
[02:38:22.224 --> 02:38:22.624]  They're filth!
[02:38:22.664 --> 02:38:23.384]  They're going to go to hell!
[02:38:23.725 --> 02:38:24.665]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:24.845 --> 02:38:27.005]  They're with their father, the father of lies.
[02:38:27.305 --> 02:38:27.825]  They love it.
[02:38:28.085 --> 02:38:28.645]  They like it.
[02:38:28.905 --> 02:38:29.486]  Let them have it.
[02:38:30.046 --> 02:38:30.666]  Let them have it.
[02:38:31.226 --> 02:38:32.046]  I mean, they don't care.
[02:38:32.086 --> 02:38:38.927]  They want to ride around with George W. stickers on their car, feeling good about themselves, never having to stand up to anything.
[02:38:39.027 --> 02:38:39.387]  Fine.
[02:38:39.707 --> 02:38:41.008]  They're a bunch of trash.
[02:38:41.028 --> 02:38:42.968]  I just want them to know that.
[02:38:43.028 --> 02:38:43.628]  You're scum.
[02:38:45.386 --> 02:38:47.107]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bobby.
[02:38:47.247 --> 02:38:49.607]  Bobby, where are you calling us from?
[02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:50.707]  California.
[02:38:51.007 --> 02:38:51.388]  Welcome.
[02:38:51.888 --> 02:38:52.188]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:52.448 --> 02:39:03.170]  I just want all you listeners that know the power of confident prayer to proactively pray that the next government-sponsored event gets whistle-blown or goes terribly wrong like all the rest of their events.
[02:39:03.891 --> 02:39:13.153]  And also to start picturing and envisioning a beautiful and just future, because globalists are dreaming of a future full of death and destruction, so it's up to us to dream of a
[02:39:14.784 --> 02:39:19.366]  Well, it is true that we're made in God's image, so what we dream we then actually build.
[02:39:19.386 --> 02:39:26.449]  The science fiction of 20 years ago is reality today, and they are dreaming of a very evil world and they're putting it into reality.
[02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:30.311]  We need to go out there and take physical action on our dreams.
[02:39:30.952 --> 02:39:31.592]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:38.914]  I've just seen those 6606 billboards everywhere, you know, be ready or whatever.
[02:39:38.954 --> 02:39:40.375]  I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[02:39:40.415 --> 02:39:42.296]  Did somebody put billboards up saying that?
[02:39:42.316 --> 02:39:44.117]  Yeah, all over L.A.
[02:39:44.177 --> 02:39:47.279]  there's 6606 billboards that say, you've been warned.
[02:39:47.419 --> 02:39:50.000]  It's all black and 6606, they're everywhere.
[02:39:52.762 --> 02:39:59.566]  For two years, you know, I should have talked about that for the whole show today, for two years people have been saying something huge is going to happen on 6606.
[02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:04.352]  And we'll be here tomorrow.
[02:40:04.792 --> 02:40:09.415]  Normally, if everybody's looking at it, everybody's talking about it, the globalists won't do something on that date.
[02:40:09.595 --> 02:40:11.557]  But they did 9-11 on 9-11.
[02:40:11.577 --> 02:40:12.878]  3-11 was 911 days after 9-11, or excuse me, 4-11 was.
[02:40:12.898 --> 02:40:13.438]  Was 911 days after 9-11.
[02:40:13.458 --> 02:40:15.099]  The Madrid bombing, 7-7, 7-21.
[02:40:15.219 --> 02:40:19.662]  I mean, they do the same stuff over and over again on the two-year anniversary of 9-11.
[02:40:32.077 --> 02:40:35.459]  The New York Lottery came up 9-11.
[02:40:36.259 --> 02:40:39.481]  The Chicago Mercantile closed on the two-year anniversary.
[02:40:39.501 --> 02:40:41.922]  The 9-11 never happened before, never happened since.
[02:40:42.322 --> 02:40:44.283]  So they love to flop this in our face.
[02:40:45.304 --> 02:40:48.245]  Something big may happen.
[02:40:48.365 --> 02:40:48.766]  We'll see.
[02:40:48.806 --> 02:40:49.666]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:40:50.226 --> 02:40:56.790]  I was watching a great film, Marshall, the scene where Giuliani and Schwarzenegger repeat 9-11 a hundred times.
[02:40:57.597 --> 02:41:03.182]  I just know they'd love to say 6606 a hundred times like that, but you know, that's what I'm saying.
[02:41:03.262 --> 02:41:09.186]  You know, we just pray, you know, everything goes, if they do, everything goes wrong, just like at other events, something goes wrong, you know?
[02:41:10.968 --> 02:41:12.129]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:12.189 --> 02:41:20.355]  You know, they supposedly busted a whole bunch of people in this Canadian police raid that we talked a little bit about in the first hour.
[02:41:20.375 --> 02:41:21.936]  Same thing happened in England.
[02:41:22.917 --> 02:41:26.200]  And mainstream news is already saying that it may have been no big deal.
[02:41:27.336 --> 02:41:31.058]  But it could have been that these were patsies, they were trying to provocateur into something.
[02:41:32.298 --> 02:41:49.605]  And then, a lot of times in cases we've seen, the patsies then start waking up to what's happening, or they realize what's going on, or good police find out what's going on, and so they have to go ahead and bust the people.
[02:41:50.226 --> 02:41:53.327]  So we don't really know what happened here, but we know that in the past,
[02:41:54.033 --> 02:41:56.955]  They've done the same type of thing over and over and over again.
[02:41:56.995 --> 02:41:59.077]  Go out and try to stage these events.
[02:42:00.038 --> 02:42:01.619]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:07.383]  Canada police using sting and terror arrest, Associated Press.
[02:42:07.844 --> 02:42:14.609]  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police itself delivered three tons of potential bomb mating material to a group that authorities said
[02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:20.422]  I wanted to launch a string of attacks inspired by Al-Qaeda, according to a news report Sunday.
[02:42:20.542 --> 02:42:23.004]  So, see, it's always the same.
[02:42:23.064 --> 02:42:24.705]  The government delivering the explosives.
[02:42:25.125 --> 02:42:27.347]  The government stirring up the group.
[02:42:27.387 --> 02:42:28.848]  The government creating the group.
[02:42:29.835 --> 02:42:40.938]  The Toronto Star said the sting unfolded when investigators delivered the ammonium nitrate to the group of Muslim Canadians, then moved in quickly on what officials called a homegrown terror ring.
[02:42:41.458 --> 02:42:51.521]  What we've seen the Feds do before, too, is just deliver ammonium nitrate to somebody and then just say they were planning to bomb something.
[02:42:51.861 --> 02:42:57.323]  I guess the Feds could have an 18-wheeler pull up in front of my house with fertilizer and take me to jail.
[02:42:58.954 --> 02:42:59.934]  I mean, I guess that's it.
[02:43:00.534 --> 02:43:01.195]  Just pull up.
[02:43:01.335 --> 02:43:03.315]  Hey, here's the ammonium you asked for.
[02:43:03.335 --> 02:43:04.155]  I didn't ask for that.
[02:43:04.475 --> 02:43:04.855]  Yeah, you did.
[02:43:04.875 --> 02:43:05.496]  You're going to jail.
[02:43:06.976 --> 02:43:16.198]  The newspaper said that investigators learned of the group's alleged plan to bomb targets around Ontario, then controlled the sale and transport of the fertilizer.
[02:43:16.998 --> 02:43:23.580]  Authorities refused to discuss the star story and have revealed few details of the reported plot or how the sting developed.
[02:43:24.918 --> 02:43:36.529]  Police arrested 12 adults, ages 19 to 43, and 5 suspects younger than 18, Friday and Saturday, on charges including plotting attacks with explosives on Canadian targets.
[02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:43.175]  And notice, Canadian officials about two weeks ago said, there's going to be big attacks, terrorists are about to hit us, get ready.
[02:43:43.755 --> 02:43:46.398]  So then they could pose as the saviors when they busted them.
[02:43:47.358 --> 02:44:00.392]  And it goes through the oldest Quaim Abdul-Jamal led prayers at a storefront mosque attended by some 40 to 50 families down the street from his home in the middle-class neighborhood of West Toronto.
[02:44:01.993 --> 02:44:03.255]  And it goes on.
[02:44:03.976 --> 02:44:08.280]  So it fits the classic MO that we see every single time.
[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:09.962]  I mean, it's not the feds cooking the bomb.
[02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:18.484]  Training the drivers, giving them the detonators, as we saw in another case, but it is very, very, very close.
[02:44:20.485 --> 02:44:29.350]  Alright, let us now go ahead and go back to some of the other callers that are patiently holding.
[02:44:30.750 --> 02:44:31.511]  Who's up next?
[02:44:32.791 --> 02:44:34.132]  DJ in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:44:34.152 --> 02:44:35.893]  Hey Alex.
[02:44:36.513 --> 02:44:36.854]  Hi.
[02:44:37.674 --> 02:44:38.254]  Good to hear you.
[02:44:40.505 --> 02:44:49.649]  The caller that was talking about how we need to roll over and, you know, it's not Christian to resist evil.
[02:44:50.589 --> 02:44:56.512]  Number one is either deaf, dumb, and blind in the spirit or is a provocateur.
[02:44:58.352 --> 02:45:09.277]  Number two is giving the enemies of the Messiah, Yeshua, cause to blaspheme his name.
[02:45:10.592 --> 02:45:14.495]  Number three, it doesn't read very good.
[02:45:14.995 --> 02:45:16.376]  Okay, I am truth.
[02:45:17.597 --> 02:45:19.098]  Truth is truth.
[02:45:19.599 --> 02:45:21.100]  Not lies that are covered up.
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:22.981]  Not evil that's covered up.
[02:45:23.021 --> 02:45:24.442]  Not murder that's covered up.
[02:45:25.884 --> 02:45:27.865]  And oh, that C word, conspiracy.
[02:45:29.526 --> 02:45:37.492]  And also, you know, when the scriptures say that in so many places, and I keep going back to Proverbs 24,
[02:45:39.136 --> 02:46:07.826]  And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12, it says, And if people go to 11 and 12
[02:46:08.542 --> 02:46:17.146]  As well, in whatever means is scriptural or is lawful, not necessarily legal.
[02:46:18.546 --> 02:46:26.550]  But you stop and think, and then you get that one that says, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:31.832]  I mean, for crying out loud, how many places does a person have to look?
[02:46:35.087 --> 02:46:45.131]  Well, I mean, we look at all the prophets, all the disciples, almost all of them are killed for exposing the government and fighting the government.
[02:46:45.191 --> 02:46:46.992]  They're not doing what the government tells them.
[02:46:47.032 --> 02:46:49.053]  I mean, any idiot can see that.
[02:46:50.473 --> 02:46:54.815]  But let me tell you, they're the majority of Christians in America, because they're not really Christians.
[02:46:55.315 --> 02:46:58.877]  They believe rowing over being a lazy possum is the way to go.
[02:46:58.897 --> 02:46:59.777]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:00.955 --> 02:47:04.156]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Utah.
[02:47:04.176 --> 02:47:04.896]  David, go ahead.
[02:47:05.857 --> 02:47:06.937]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:47:06.977 --> 02:47:07.577]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:47:08.538 --> 02:47:19.662]  Well, I also wanted to kind of call in and address the gentleman who upset you rather well earlier in regard to... Well, he didn't upset me.
[02:47:19.862 --> 02:47:21.202]  All of this scum upsets me.
[02:47:22.042 --> 02:47:24.383]  Well, and it very well should.
[02:47:24.403 --> 02:47:29.345]  And basically, you know, the only time
[02:47:30.484 --> 02:47:40.091]  In the Bible, if Christ ever really got mad at anybody, it was over empires of man, which are in, you know, they're against God.
[02:47:40.151 --> 02:47:47.436]  Empires of man have no place in society of man, because that's the mechanism, that's the vehicle for evil.
[02:47:48.737 --> 02:47:58.204]  And, you know, when you build up a position and give it power, and give it unlimited power, even if it may
[02:47:58.857 --> 02:48:04.302]  Be used in a good way, perceivably, you know, in the short term.
[02:48:04.362 --> 02:48:11.067]  In the long term, what you have is a vehicle that anybody could get into and drive if they really wanted to steal it.
[02:48:12.388 --> 02:48:22.337]  And, you know, combining and consolidating our rights and our freedoms, you know, that's everything that God, you know, doesn't want us to do.
[02:48:22.557 --> 02:48:24.999]  Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[02:48:25.569 --> 02:48:27.350]  I mean, how many verses are there like that?
[02:48:27.570 --> 02:48:28.911]  These people don't read the Bible.
[02:48:29.451 --> 02:48:33.072]  They go in, they sit down every Sunday, and the preacher says, lay down to George Bush.
[02:48:33.112 --> 02:48:33.673]  He's God.
[02:48:34.053 --> 02:48:35.293]  We've got to do what the government says.
[02:48:35.353 --> 02:48:36.994]  Don't go protest abortion.
[02:48:37.194 --> 02:48:37.895]  Give me money.
[02:48:38.475 --> 02:48:39.135]  Give me money.
[02:48:39.195 --> 02:48:39.755]  That's all they do.
[02:48:39.795 --> 02:48:40.696]  Give me your money.
[02:48:41.536 --> 02:48:42.357]  I'm a preacher.
[02:48:42.397 --> 02:48:43.837]  I've got jewelry all over me.
[02:48:46.109 --> 02:48:54.352]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:48:54.552 --> 02:48:56.873]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:48:57.473 --> 02:49:06.336]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:49:06.856 --> 02:49:10.378]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:49:10.818 --> 02:49:31.629]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:49:31.929 --> 02:49:35.631]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:49:35.791 --> 02:49:35.972]  Yes.
[02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:37.375]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[02:49:37.756 --> 02:49:43.048]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:49:46.565 --> 02:49:51.790]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.930 --> 02:50:00.017]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.277 --> 02:50:07.343]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.523 --> 02:50:08.784]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:08.864 --> 02:50:14.767]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.967 --> 02:50:20.050]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:20.170 --> 02:50:29.055]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:29.295 --> 02:50:36.239]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[02:50:41.343 --> 02:50:44.145]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:44.325 --> 02:50:53.633]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.853 --> 02:50:56.115]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:56.295 --> 02:51:02.661]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.981 --> 02:51:03.641]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.498 --> 02:51:35.599]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.759 --> 02:51:41.722]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.663 --> 02:51:50.325]  Now all the M.O., all the signatures, all the signs are this is another provocateur stage terror.
[02:52:00.627 --> 02:52:25.889]  raid in England and the one in Canada but we've got to remember at the same time that governments routinely also go out and bust real terrorists but those very same governments brag in Pentagon documents like P2OG that buy
[02:52:27.006 --> 02:52:33.251]  Bombing countries, invading countries, killing people, that it will then stimulate, quote, real terrorist attacks.
[02:52:33.311 --> 02:52:34.833]  I mean, there are crazies everywhere.
[02:52:34.853 --> 02:52:40.277]  I mean, there are white guys, black guys, that for no reason go crazy and go out and bomb things.
[02:52:40.898 --> 02:52:42.219]  And I've studied this historically.
[02:52:42.279 --> 02:52:45.702]  It's normally, you know, small, ineffectual, kills one or two people.
[02:52:46.302 --> 02:52:47.664]  It's not, you know, the big huge events.
[02:52:48.264 --> 02:52:51.327]  The huge events that I've studied are always government.
[02:52:52.227 --> 02:52:54.810]  Does a Muslim go crazy and stab people or shoot people?
[02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:55.090]  Yeah!
[02:52:55.859 --> 02:52:58.562]  And white guys walk into McDonald's and kill 40 people, too.
[02:52:59.102 --> 02:53:00.504]  I mean, this type of stuff happens.
[02:53:01.485 --> 02:53:03.967]  But government stands to gain from it.
[02:53:04.047 --> 02:53:05.929]  Giving up your liberty won't keep you safe.
[02:53:06.730 --> 02:53:10.533]  The government certainly hypes it and over-hypes it and uses it to take our freedoms.
[02:53:11.074 --> 02:53:13.096]  And the big events certainly are the government.
[02:53:14.357 --> 02:53:19.502]  And almost every case we look at, and this one's starting to look like it, they provocateur people into it.
[02:53:20.063 --> 02:53:33.746]  I mean, listen, folks, I've had people many times who I later confirmed and wrote down on their license plate and found out they were FBI or informants or even awesome cops trying to get me to shoot my mouth off about carrying out terrorist attacks.
[02:53:34.726 --> 02:53:37.147]  And I just tell them, I know you're a fed, get away from me.
[02:53:37.947 --> 02:53:40.868]  And in many cases, they have turned out to be just that.
[02:53:41.388 --> 02:53:49.530]  So, I mean, if Alex Jones, talking to you right now, has dealt with this for 12 years, I mean, back when I was pretty mainstream, this was going on.
[02:53:50.071 --> 02:53:53.714]  These guys, they got them in every town, every city, full time.
[02:53:54.834 --> 02:53:58.017]  And they go around trying to get people to talk about how they're going to blow stuff up.
[02:53:58.777 --> 02:54:05.722]  And then they get more funding, they get to take more of our freedoms for the local cops, they get promoted, they get more funding.
[02:54:06.403 --> 02:54:07.444]  And you guys are criminals.
[02:54:07.684 --> 02:54:08.825]  These stings are criminal.
[02:54:10.646 --> 02:54:11.707]  Because they do them out of the blue.
[02:54:11.747 --> 02:54:17.070]  It's one thing if you hear somebody's already planning something, you've got evidence of it, then you go in and try to sell them something.
[02:54:17.091 --> 02:54:17.731]  That's one thing.
[02:54:18.271 --> 02:54:19.052]  But just going up
[02:54:19.685 --> 02:54:26.787]  Cold calls off the street trying to get people to carry out terror attacks or creating Klan groups as you've been caught doing.
[02:54:27.087 --> 02:54:28.327]  You all need to go to prison!
[02:54:31.048 --> 02:54:36.129]  It's like towns that don't have cocaine in them and the cop shows up to town wanting to sell everybody cocaine.
[02:54:36.490 --> 02:54:38.070]  And they get a bunch of teenagers to buy it.
[02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:45.032]  I remember one time in eighth grade, this kid kept trying to sell me marijuana over and over again.
[02:54:45.052 --> 02:54:48.933]  For some reason the school thought I was some kind of marijuana dealer or something, which I wasn't.
[02:54:50.270 --> 02:54:53.431]  And they kept trying to sell me marijuana.
[02:54:54.492 --> 02:54:55.452]  Sell me marijuana!
[02:54:55.512 --> 02:54:56.573]  Sell me marijuana!
[02:54:56.653 --> 02:55:07.417]  And then later that month, that very kid trying to sell me marijuana, he got some other kid to buy marijuana from him, and then they busted the kid that bought the marijuana!
[02:55:07.497 --> 02:55:08.317]  I mean, what?
[02:55:09.138 --> 02:55:11.299]  You got kids?
[02:55:11.399 --> 02:55:14.000]  It wasn't even like a 21 Jump Street.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:15.200]  It wasn't an undercover cop.
[02:55:16.481 --> 02:55:16.901]  It was
[02:55:18.397 --> 02:55:21.098]  A student they had going around trying to sell marijuana.
[02:55:22.538 --> 02:55:24.339]  I mean, that's what this country is, folks.
[02:55:24.679 --> 02:55:30.920]  You put your kid in school so the government can try to sell them marijuana to then put your kid in jail!
[02:55:32.281 --> 02:55:33.221]  I'm sick of it!
[02:55:36.282 --> 02:55:41.023]  The drug war they're shipping in to create the crisis, the terror war, they're behind 90 plus percent of it.
[02:55:41.043 --> 02:55:46.405]  And then they go over there in the Middle East and blow those countries to bits.
[02:55:46.485 --> 02:55:47.405]  It's going to make some
[02:55:48.306 --> 02:55:49.727]  Real people attack us.
[02:55:49.867 --> 02:55:50.927]  We attack Iran.
[02:55:51.588 --> 02:55:53.549]  The globalists probably won't have to stage anything.
[02:55:53.869 --> 02:55:55.310]  What do you expect Iran to do?
[02:55:56.530 --> 02:55:57.991]  We're cruising for a bruising.
[02:55:58.511 --> 02:55:58.891]  Alright.
[02:55:59.452 --> 02:56:00.692]  I'm sorry for the loaded phones.
[02:56:00.792 --> 02:56:02.213]  I just don't have time to take your calls.
[02:56:02.753 --> 02:56:04.374]  I haven't had a lot of sleep the last few days.
[02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:06.535]  I was in a good mood until that caller.
[02:56:06.575 --> 02:56:09.317]  Just his spirit was so weak.
[02:56:10.697 --> 02:56:11.698]  I don't mean to sound mean.
[02:56:11.738 --> 02:56:16.860]  It's just the sound of it was like nails on a chalkboard to me.
[02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:21.796]  You'll get yours, buddy, don't worry.
[02:56:22.297 --> 02:56:23.077]  God bless you all.
