[00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:06.317]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:08.039]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:09.860]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.322]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:13.003]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:17.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:21.932]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:35.194]  Well, gold right now is over $704 an ounce.
[00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:50.340]  Oil prices are climbing back up steadily again after Condoleezza Rice a few days ago took the President of Iran's letter, the first from an Iranian head of state, calling the President, Your Excellency and Sir.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.641]  And they just took it and basically wadded it up and laughed at him.
[00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.183]  Yes, that's the great diplomacy.
[00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.483]  You see, they want a war.
[00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.804]  Now oil prices are exploding yet again.
[00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:05.975]  And the globalists know that this helps the crisis widen or out of chaos.
[00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:07.676]  That's what they want.
[00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:08.477]  That's what they're doing.
[00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:12.239]  I want to get some into the President of Iran's letter.
[00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:17.222]  It's been out for a few days, but I just had a chance to read the entire 18 pages last night.
[00:01:17.942 --> 00:01:26.086]  He talks about 9-11, questioning the official story, though vaguely, and he gets into a lot of the crimes committed against the Iranians and a lot more.
[00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:26.727]  We'll get into that.
[00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:32.339]  And no, I'm not for the Iranians, but I'm sure not for the bankers that run this country either.
[00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:36.980]  Governments themselves throughout history are corrupt and out of control and wicked.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:48.262]  And I think that goes for the Iranian government as well, but compared to the New World Order, Iran is run by a lower demon, and America is truly run by Beelzebub in chief.
[00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:52.842]  An admitted practicing Satanist, Bush is.
[00:01:53.923 --> 00:01:56.003]  A servant of the dark side, he is.
[00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:57.923]  No debating it.
[00:01:58.183 --> 00:01:58.803]  He is.
[00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:02.964]  And we'll get into the Minutemen.
[00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:06.485]  In fact, we'll do this when we get back from break.
[00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:09.566]  It's the most outrageous thing we've seen yet.
[00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:11.746]  U.S.
[00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:14.407]  tipping Mexico to Minutemen patrols.
[00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:18.868]  But first, let's go ahead and roll Inside Job and we'll come back after the break and get right into the news.
[00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:20.088]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:20.508]  Stay with us.
[00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.581]  They came and took it all away.
[00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.543]  The lanes in the middle.
[00:02:33.643 --> 00:02:38.807]  The places where you used to play.
[00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:48.073]  It was an inside job by the well-connected George Middlebury.
[00:02:55.206 --> 00:03:00.209]  We're good.
[00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:55.973]  This little island disappears While you are looking the other way They'll take your right to own your own ideas And if it isn't your favorite city Your trusted servants have left you a prediction
[00:04:05.903 --> 00:04:09.587]  We're good.
[00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:34.737]  I don't know what I've done wrong, I am a
[00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:05.564]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:10.190]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.532]  There is a chance...
[00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:14.704]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:16.146]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:17.567]  Can emerge.
[00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:22.111]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:29.097]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:31.239]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:41.961]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:47.622]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:04.135]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:08.377]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:11.419]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.000]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:22.843]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:24.384]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:28.746]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:29.846]  We're good to go!
[00:06:57.854 --> 00:06:59.110]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:06.659]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.400]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.240]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:11.721]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:13.342]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.982 --> 00:08:17.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.184 --> 00:08:22.305]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:28.228]  It is Wednesday, the 10th day of May, 2006.
[00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.228]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:31.469]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:37.466]  New draconian anti-gun legislation moving through at the federal level.
[00:08:37.486 --> 00:08:46.776]  Aaron Zellman of Jews the Preservation of Firearms ownership will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour or roughly an hour and 20 minutes from now.
[00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:55.297]  Then we have Dar Jamal who's been on with us several times with new information concerning what's really going on in Iraq.
[00:08:55.757 --> 00:08:58.519]  He'll be joining us today in the third hour.
[00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:01.341]  We'll have wide open phones for all three hours.
[00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:03.482]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:07.365]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:20.778]  Well, Hillary Clinton and Rupert Murdoch told the Financial Times of London after their big story yesterday about how the two are inseparable and Murdoch's going to raise money for her.
[00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:25.362]  They came out with their spin, and we'll be getting into that.
[00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:28.224]  Of course, we're evil liberals here because we're against Hillary.
[00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:31.387]  Now, to be a conservative, you must be pro-Hillary.
[00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:32.048]  Just watch.
[00:09:32.862 --> 00:09:38.693]  Neocons love the anti-gun, pro-world government Tony Blair, and they're really going to love Hillary.
[00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:42.439]  But right now, the treason continues.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.301]  We know that
[00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:52.881]  Our porous border has been fostered, the porousness of it has been fostered by the White House no matter what administration we've seen the last 30 years.
[00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:58.002]  It has been fostered and pushed by the Mexican government for over 60 years.
[00:09:58.443 --> 00:10:03.724]  They teach every grade school student in Mexico that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:18.779]  And that every problem in Mexico is caused by the evil Americans, and our government just loves it because it's part of the public CFR plan that even Lou Dobbs has covered to break up the sovereignty of America for an American Union similar to the European Union.
[00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:27.348]  And we know that everywhere the Minutemen show up, in Texas, in Arizona, and in Southern California,
[00:10:28.334 --> 00:10:31.177]  That they're being followed by Feds.
[00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:42.887]  And the Feds, we already had gotten reports of this, were radioing the exact locations in real time and even using military spy aircraft to track the Minutemen.
[00:10:42.927 --> 00:10:44.128]  We've covered this in the past.
[00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:49.973]  Now it's in the Associated Press and several other major publications.
[00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:54.737]  The Mexican government is bragging about this.
[00:10:56.932 --> 00:11:13.247]  President Bush has had the federal government pay states nationwide from Texas to Florida to South Carolina to Virginia to Arizona just all over the place to have these federally written training manuals where they say property rights activist
[00:11:14.074 --> 00:11:17.217]  Gun owners, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:11:17.257 --> 00:11:18.078]  Constitution.
[00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:20.120]  These are exact quotes, by the way.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.884]  Homeschoolers, those that believe in sovereignty of the states.
[00:11:25.264 --> 00:11:26.465]  Those that believe in a U.N.
[00:11:26.545 --> 00:11:27.386]  conspiracy.
[00:11:29.408 --> 00:11:32.050]  That we are terrorists and need to be watched.
[00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:36.114]  So, so, tattle on everyone, spy on everyone.
[00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:39.737]  If you have a road almanac in your car, it's a sure sign of being a terrorist.
[00:11:40.057 --> 00:11:42.299]  If you're wearing blue jeans, Levi's, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.380]  If you have a cell phone, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.642]  If you're traveling with women and children, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:49.144]  If you're polite and kindly to police, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:51.065]  I mean, these are the official manuals.
[00:11:52.226 --> 00:11:55.809]  And then Bush comes out last year and says, the Minutemen are dangerous vigilantes.
[00:11:56.528 --> 00:12:02.337]  And he sicks the Justice Department on them, and all over the country they'll charge border watch groups for the most petty of things.
[00:12:02.358 --> 00:12:10.571]  It doesn't matter if a French TV news crews there covering the Minutemen, and that was even a pre-Minutemen group, Ranch Rescue.
[00:12:11.662 --> 00:12:17.145]  Giving blankets and water to two, what was it, Venezuelans that had come across the border.
[00:12:17.165 --> 00:12:18.565]  No, it was Nicaraguans.
[00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:23.028]  And then they run off and claim that they were abused by the ranch rescue.
[00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:25.029]  It doesn't matter if there's video tape of the whole thing.
[00:12:25.409 --> 00:12:27.610]  And then they end up losing their ranches and going to jail.
[00:12:28.593 --> 00:12:31.214]  So, spy on each other inside America.
[00:12:31.294 --> 00:12:32.374]  Spy on your neighbors.
[00:12:32.734 --> 00:12:33.834]  Report everyone.
[00:12:34.194 --> 00:12:38.675]  Coast to coast, right here in Austin, Texas, they give out little discount credit cards.
[00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:41.536]  It gives them, like, freebies at the school cafeteria.
[00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:47.918]  And they get extra credits and get CD players and Walkmans and $200 PlayStation 2s.
[00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:51.298]  If they tattle on their parents, what's in the medicine cabinet?
[00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:57.840]  I have local TV ads in my film Road to Tyranny where it shows the Austin police advertising on TV.
[00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:00.061]  Report your parents!
[00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:01.005]  Report your neighbors!
[00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:01.848]  Report everyone!
[00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.536]  You're now enrolled in the program!
[00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:07.450]  That's all wonderful and good.
[00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:30.738]  Of course, it's completely un-American, but if you go down the border, even on your own property or someone else's property who's a volunteer, and you videotape, and you have radios, and you have cell phones, and you don't touch the illegals, you just call the police, you have the FBI and others, and the Border Patrol, not busy arresting the coyotes, the smugglers, the drug dealers, the human smugglers, the murderers that have killed over 800 just last year on the Texas-Mexican border,
[00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:41.282]  The State Department's stating last year in three separate emergency releases that it is more dangerous on the Texas-Mexico border than it is in the West Bank of Israel.
[00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:54.607]  All mainstream news, all admitted, machine gunnings, car bombings, total slaughter going on, cops being killed every month, sheriffs having Mexican troops come up and aim machine guns at them and taking drugs back that have been seized.
[00:13:54.627 --> 00:13:56.308]  We've had the sheriffs on, it's been in the news.
[00:13:56.608 --> 00:13:57.588]  You know the laundry list.
[00:13:58.188 --> 00:13:59.729]  All of this is going on!
[00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:04.133]  And we have this in front of us here today.
[00:14:05.354 --> 00:14:07.757]  First report about the Daily Bullets and also the Associated Press.
[00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:08.799]  U.S.
[00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:11.782]  tipping Mexico to Minutemen patrols.
[00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:16.068]  Top story up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:21.388]  While Minutemen civilian patrols are keeping an eye out for illegal border crossers, the U.S.
[00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:26.273]  Border Patrol is keeping an eye out for the Minutemen and telling the Mexican government where they are.
[00:14:26.573 --> 00:14:28.035]  And we've talked to many of the Minutemen.
[00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:30.338]  We've talked to Al Garza, their national coordinator.
[00:14:30.658 --> 00:14:32.019]  He's been shot at three times.
[00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:37.225]  So, our government, and by the way, the Mexican troops and the Mexican Mafia openly have a $200,000 bounty on Border Patrol's heads.
[00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:47.564]  And don't weasel around that psychologically, cops listening, because you worship the government no matter what it does, even as it flushes you down the toilet.
[00:14:48.085 --> 00:14:49.265]  That has been in the mainstream news.
[00:14:49.285 --> 00:14:53.287]  There is a $200,000 bounty on law enforcement on the border.
[00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:55.448]  Predominantly on the Border Patrol.
[00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:56.569]  So what do they do?
[00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:02.132]  Oh, let's give them the data so they can shoot at the minutemen that are trying to support us.
[00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:03.793]  Because we've been ordered to.
[00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.014]  Why do you follow orders?
[00:15:06.929 --> 00:15:09.271]  Would you stick your mother in an oven if they told you to?
[00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.015]  According to three documents on the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations website, the U.S.
[00:15:14.055 --> 00:15:27.225]  Border Patrol is to notify the Mexican government as to the location of Minutemen and other civilian border patrol groups when they participate in apprehending illegal immigrants, and if and when violence is used against border crossers.
[00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:28.567]  So they add that little caveat.
[00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:29.787]  A U.S.
[00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:36.373]  Customs and Border Protection spokesman confirmed the notification process, describing it as a standard procedure meant to reassure
[00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:42.433]  Reassure the Mexican government that migrants' rights are being observed.
[00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:47.397]  What, their rights to engage in the reconquering of the Southwest?
[00:15:47.417 --> 00:15:47.877]  You mean that?
[00:15:48.838 --> 00:15:50.479]  The rights of your coyotes to feed on them?
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.985]  The rights of your troops to kill cops and citizens and torch houses and rob sheriffs at gunpoint?
[00:15:57.325 --> 00:15:58.125]  Guns to their heads?
[00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:04.951]  It's not a secret where the Minuteman volunteers are going to be, said Mario Martinez Monday.
[00:16:05.555 --> 00:16:07.397]  This simply makes two basic statements.
[00:16:07.737 --> 00:16:17.426]  That we will not allow any lawlessness of any type, and that if an alien is encountered by a Minuteman, or arrested by the Minuteman, then we will allow the government to interview the person.
[00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:23.471]  And that is the Mexican Foreign Relations Statement.
[00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:26.034]  So, they're the boss.
[00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:27.675]  They're the boss.
[00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:28.215]  There they are.
[00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:29.777]  They run things.
[00:16:30.277 --> 00:16:34.081]  They're a good corrupt government that our government's using to destroy America, so they're going to be given the red carpet.
[00:16:34.621 --> 00:16:45.012]  Minutemen members were not so sanguine about the arrangement, however, saying that reporting their location to Mexican officials nullifies their effectiveness along the border and could endanger their lives.
[00:16:45.032 --> 00:16:50.737]  Yeah, the Mexican troops have been caught with the flat-backed trucks just carrying thousands of illegals here and there.
[00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:51.478]  They just go around them.
[00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:59.826]  Now we know why it seems like Mexican officials know where we are all the time, said Chris Simcox, founder of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps.
[00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:05.568]  It's unbelievable that our own government agency is sending intelligence to another country.
[00:17:06.408 --> 00:17:13.771]  They are sending intelligence to a nation where corruption runs rampant and that could be getting into the hands of criminal cartels.
[00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:14.491]  Could be?
[00:17:14.551 --> 00:17:15.412]  What do you mean?
[00:17:15.852 --> 00:17:18.953]  They just basically endanger the lives of the American people.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.081]  Well, when Americans get killed or kidnapped, it's just back of the paper.
[00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:22.701]  Nobody cares.
[00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:24.242]  Wow.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.281]  Once an illegal alien is apprehended, they can request counsel, he said.
[00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:56.002]  We have to give the counsel the information about the apprehension, and that includes where they were apprehended, whether a Minuteman volunteer spotted them, or a citizen.
[00:17:56.362 --> 00:18:00.783]  And what they do is, and we've caught them, they've been told, they've been given lawyers, phone numbers, and how to do it.
[00:18:01.203 --> 00:18:09.705]  Even if a Minuteman doesn't touch them, they know the location, and they claim when the Border Patrol shows up, that they were assaulted, and they lie under oath, and the U.S.
[00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:13.546]  attorneys and local state attorneys, they swoop in viciously.
[00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:16.228]  The government's playing hardball, folks.
[00:18:16.248 --> 00:18:18.869]  They've got to make sure that border stays open to break down this country.
[00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:31.196]  Martinez said Mexican officials' perception of the civilian groups is that they are vigilantes, a belief the Border Patrol hopes to allay, well the President says it too, by entering into a cooperative agreement.
[00:18:31.316 --> 00:18:31.997]  Yes.
[00:18:34.478 --> 00:18:35.619]  Isn't that just special?
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:55.792]  One of the documents on the website, Actions of the Mexican Government in Relation to the Activities of Vigilante Groups, states that the Mexican Consulate Representatives stay in close contact with Border Patrol Chiefs to ensure the safety of the migrants trying to enter the U.S., those being detained, and the actions of all vigilantes along the border.
[00:18:56.392 --> 00:19:00.355]  The Mexican Council and Presidio also contacted the Chief of the Border Patrol
[00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:10.590]  uh... in the sector to solicit his cooperation in case they detect any activities of the vigilantes and who were told to immediately contact the consulate if there was according to the document.
[00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:29.541]  So, you got the Mexican troops running around dealing drugs, killing people, robbing Mexicans, shooting at sheriffs, killing sheriff's deputies, stealing from sheriffs, taking drugs back from sheriffs, and then they're all busy reporting back what the men and men are doing, but meanwhile telling the American citizens to tattle on anyone and everyone around you and training your children how to be brown shirt Nazis.
[00:19:31.229 --> 00:19:32.510]  So, just understand that.
[00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:40.935]  The document also describes a meeting between San Diego Border Patrol Chief Daryl Griffin and the Mexican terrorist.
[00:19:41.735 --> 00:19:42.155]  I would add.
[00:19:43.556 --> 00:19:44.977]  And it goes on for another page.
[00:19:45.177 --> 00:19:45.937]  Oh my gosh.
[00:19:46.017 --> 00:19:47.078]  I'll get more into this later.
[00:19:47.178 --> 00:19:49.239]  We'll take your calls on this subject and others.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.343]  We'll talk about the Iranian President's letter that they used for Bird Cage Liner as soon as it hit the State Department.
[00:19:56.343 --> 00:19:58.725]  And Hillary and Fox News and a lift lock.

[00:24:27.602 --> 00:24:29.043]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[00:24:29.123 --> 00:24:30.404]  Ron, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:24:34.346 --> 00:24:34.866]  Hello, Alex.
[00:24:35.707 --> 00:24:36.928]  Yeah, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:24:38.332 --> 00:24:40.033]  A few things I want to touch on today.
[00:24:40.153 --> 00:24:44.195]  One thing is a New York State thing that I think may set a precedent throughout the country.
[00:24:44.236 --> 00:24:46.837]  It may be a bellwether if this is to happen or to pass.
[00:24:47.918 --> 00:24:57.623]  They want to enact a law now in which people, when charged with misdemeanor offenses, misdemeanor offenses, have DNA samples taken.
[00:24:58.383 --> 00:25:00.805]  There's almost just about no limitation.
[00:25:00.845 --> 00:25:04.607]  They're using all kinds of rhetoric to try and pressure to get this law passed.
[00:25:05.436 --> 00:25:14.836]  My recommendation is to people in New York State that hear this broadcast, who have any conscience about this, they've got to realize that this is just any flimsy attempt.
[00:25:15.385 --> 00:25:16.606]  To scoop up your DNA.
[00:25:16.986 --> 00:25:19.488]  They'll use any flimsy excuse to do that.
[00:25:19.929 --> 00:25:20.989]  To get as many in the database as possible.
[00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:28.355]  Well, all over the country, it's anyone who's arrested now, even for traffic violations, they're trying to pass state laws to take DNA.
[00:25:28.915 --> 00:25:30.236]  England's doing something similar.
[00:25:30.256 --> 00:25:40.724]  What people don't know is, crime labs have been caught from Houston, at the local level, the county-city level, all the way up to the FBI crime lab, manufacturing fake DNA evidence.
[00:25:41.105 --> 00:25:42.886]  DNA evidence is not 100% as we've been told.
[00:25:44.514 --> 00:25:45.255]  No, it's not.
[00:25:45.915 --> 00:25:54.883]  It's a little bit more complex than the average person would know, so they mislead a lot of juries with it and make them think that it's the magic or silver bullet to cure all criminal problems.
[00:25:54.923 --> 00:25:57.906]  In fact, it's not, but that's very long to get into.
[00:25:58.546 --> 00:26:02.990]  However, you know, you shouldn't have them scooping up DNA, certainly for minor offenses.
[00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.132]  As a matter of fact, one of the big arguing points
[00:26:07.026 --> 00:26:15.409]  on the part of those state representatives against this is that police will take DNA in an investigation uh... to eliminate people who haven't even been charged
[00:26:16.104 --> 00:26:27.031]  And they don't even want to get rid of, in other words... Sir, they've had cases, what was the case down in Louisiana two years ago where they arrested or made thousands come in and give DNA because of a murder, remember that?
[00:26:27.331 --> 00:26:27.912]  Yes, I do.
[00:26:28.572 --> 00:26:37.058]  And if that was New York State and probably the case in Louisiana, they will not take that DNA out of the database once it's established that they're totally innocent people.
[00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:41.961]  So they're just using any flimsy reason literally to soak up your DNA.
[00:26:42.785 --> 00:26:43.866]  This is diabolical.
[00:26:43.906 --> 00:26:48.251]  This is the trademark of a government that's behaving in the most suspect ways.
[00:26:48.751 --> 00:27:01.964]  Well, I mean, if you're upset about that, Ron, which I'm upset and I'm glad you're upset about it, I've had congressmen on, it must have been five years ago, last time I really talked about this, now did you know starting 33 years ago, anyone 33 years old or younger,
[00:27:05.047 --> 00:27:13.675]  Every major health department affiliated hospital in the country takes three ampoules of blood and they tell you, oh, it's for a blood test.
[00:27:13.695 --> 00:27:15.657]  Well, they could do that blood test there at the hospital.
[00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:18.180]  And they go, oh, it's going to the health department.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.745]  And indeed, the health screening for blood diseases is done at the health department, but the other two ampoules
[00:27:24.205 --> 00:27:28.567]  are sent to very quietly held federal databases.
[00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.988]  One is in Lansing, Michigan.
[00:27:30.508 --> 00:27:31.428]  Another is in Dallas.
[00:27:31.448 --> 00:27:32.869]  There's another in North Carolina.
[00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:36.511]  And they send them to these giant freeze-dried databases.
[00:27:36.711 --> 00:27:41.933]  And there was a court case a few years ago where they're not just keeping these on record.
[00:27:41.973 --> 00:27:44.394]  It's a large ampule of freeze-dried blood.
[00:27:45.275 --> 00:27:50.257]  The Genick Engineering companies are buying part of the samples and then they find certain
[00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.490]  We're good to go.
[00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:18.190]  In the last twenty-something years, and now it's thirty-three years, thirty-three, almost thirty-four years ago, in England, Canada, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand.
[00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:24.033]  I call it the Echelon Group of Countries, because all five of those countries work through Echelon.
[00:28:24.053 --> 00:28:25.174]  Here it will be Head Start.
[00:28:25.234 --> 00:28:26.695]  In England it will be Smart Start.
[00:28:27.115 --> 00:28:30.056]  Every program has the same name, or almost the same name.
[00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:36.520]  It's all done exactly the same, controlled by the same... It's a global grid.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.661]  And so all of us have our blood in their database.
[00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:43.002]  Yes, I'm aware that's been going on since the early 1970s.
[00:28:43.202 --> 00:28:45.282]  Absolutely, and it was quiet for quite a long time.
[00:28:46.883 --> 00:28:48.063]  You know, it's too much.
[00:28:48.984 --> 00:28:50.004]  You've got to suspect.
[00:28:50.304 --> 00:28:56.326]  Nobody can be so silly and so naive as to think that when a government engages in this, that it has your interests at heart.
[00:28:57.206 --> 00:29:02.788]  And another thing on a government front, for everybody who thinks that... I'm going to stop you, and then I'll hold you over, Ron, if I need you.
[00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:03.708]  I'm going to make this point.
[00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:11.031]  They kept the Manhattan Project secret for three years with over 2,000 people involved in it full time.
[00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:13.473]  So I don't want to hear they can't keep the blood secret.
[00:29:13.713 --> 00:29:17.096]  The blood is public and still no one that I talk to knows about it.
[00:29:17.356 --> 00:29:18.997]  And people at hospitals laugh at you.
[00:29:19.017 --> 00:29:20.238]  They don't even know where they're sending it.
[00:29:20.879 --> 00:29:22.560]  And it's the same thing with 9-11.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.621]  It's the same thing with any of this criminality.
[00:29:25.842 --> 00:29:26.603]  They're doing it.
[00:29:26.663 --> 00:29:27.984]  They do get caught doing it.
[00:29:28.064 --> 00:29:29.285]  And they don't stop doing it.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.241]  So, you know, it's the same across the board.
[00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:35.223]  It shows how maniacal these individuals are.
[00:29:35.303 --> 00:29:35.923]  Ron, stay there.
[00:29:35.943 --> 00:29:36.683]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:29:37.043 --> 00:29:38.264]  Ron calls in every few weeks.
[00:29:38.304 --> 00:29:40.125]  He's a retired New York police detective.
[00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.006]  We always love having him on with us.
[00:29:42.026 --> 00:29:42.926]  A lot of great insight.
[00:29:43.627 --> 00:29:45.668]  This is serious, serious business.
[00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:46.968]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.891 --> 00:29:52.811]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.872]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.892 --> 00:29:58.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.282]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:30:05.882 --> 00:30:11.205]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:15.768]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:24.714]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[00:30:25.754 --> 00:30:36.222]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.

[00:31:02.017 --> 00:31:08.261]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of the table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.401 --> 00:31:14.564]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.845 --> 00:31:23.290]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:30.554]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.854 --> 00:31:35.678]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.898 --> 00:31:41.302]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.642 --> 00:31:44.705]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:45.065 --> 00:31:53.051]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:03.146 --> 00:32:05.727]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:05.887 --> 00:32:08.048]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:08.328 --> 00:32:18.411]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?

[00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.310]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.331]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:10.592]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.012 --> 00:33:14.513]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.954 --> 00:33:19.035]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:19.575 --> 00:33:23.797]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:32.304]  Later in the broadcast I'll be playing Neil Young's new song, one off of his new album.
[00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:35.868]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:33:36.408 --> 00:33:44.156]  We'll be getting into Iran, the letter that the Iranian President sent that was used as toilet paper by Condi Rice and Lord Bush and others.
[00:33:44.176 --> 00:33:46.358]  It's an interesting letter everyone should read.
[00:33:47.091 --> 00:34:02.464]  And, of course, we do have Aaron Zellman, who is the preservation of firearms ownership, joining us at the bottom of the next hour about some new important moves against the Second Amendment that are taking place right now that the mainline gun organizations aren't going to tell you about because they're bought and paid for by the New World Order.
[00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:03.424]  Yes, it's true.
[00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:06.147]  And more on Hillary and Rupert Murdoch.
[00:34:06.227 --> 00:34:07.468]  I keep talking about this.
[00:34:08.128 --> 00:34:10.110]  A lot of people just can't face the truth.
[00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.813]  And you're going to have to face it when Fox News starts promoting Hillary.
[00:34:15.162 --> 00:34:17.944]  Of course, at that point, he'll probably just worship her and kneel before her.
[00:34:18.424 --> 00:34:22.527]  I don't mean our listeners, but some of the neocons out there that occasionally tune in.
[00:34:22.807 --> 00:34:25.648]  Let's go back to Ron in New York, let him finish up, and we'll go to other callers.
[00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:26.349]  Go ahead, Ron.
[00:34:26.549 --> 00:34:27.089]  Yes, Alex.
[00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.910]  Two more points.
[00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:42.559]  That starting next month, also, the Center for Disease Control, I believe it is, is initiating federal protocols that doctors, when they do a routine checkup of any patient, regardless of background or circumstances, must now also conduct an AIDS test.
[00:34:43.362 --> 00:34:45.143]  Know that that's going to start next month.
[00:34:46.964 --> 00:34:54.650]  Well, they have these other little regulations they pass where the doctor's got to snoop on you and ask you if you have guns or... Yeah, they do that too.
[00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:55.810]  That's just one more though.
[00:34:56.331 --> 00:35:06.057]  They'll now be, every time you go in for a routine checkup to your physician, they will be required by federal regulation to conduct an AIDS test, an HIV-AIDS test on you.
[00:35:06.257 --> 00:35:07.258]  But everyone... No matter who you are.
[00:35:08.175 --> 00:35:10.216]  So you'll have to have a needle jab in your arm?
[00:35:10.456 --> 00:35:11.016]  Absolutely.
[00:35:11.236 --> 00:35:11.956]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:12.736]  I don't like needles.
[00:35:12.756 --> 00:35:13.336]  Absolutely not.
[00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:18.257]  And I would suggest anybody who respects themselves as an American certainly protest that.
[00:35:18.337 --> 00:35:19.278]  Well, here's an example.
[00:35:19.598 --> 00:35:28.360]  Three years ago, or two and a half years ago, I went with my wife and son to SeaWorld San Antonio, and they just put the hand scanners in.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.480]  And they said, sir, you have to do it.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.740]  And I said, no, I don't.
[00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:33.921]  And they said, okay, you can go through.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:57.771]  Well I went back a few weeks ago with my family and now they say that most people refuse and they say just go on through without doing it and I sat there and I videotaped all these poor sheep going ahead and going along with it and sometime later in the next few weeks I'll put a little piece together of that little ten minute piece and put it on InfoWars.com and on the local TV show for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:35:58.869 --> 00:36:10.253]  This is going on, and so saying no, it's like the cops and the firemen and the first responders three years ago said no to the smallpox shot when they were ordered to take it, and then that whole program fell apart.
[00:36:10.713 --> 00:36:13.734]  And it's the same with this AIDS test, which I did see out of New York State.
[00:36:14.034 --> 00:36:15.435]  You've just got to say no to that.
[00:36:15.695 --> 00:36:16.295]  Well, it's federal.
[00:36:16.335 --> 00:36:18.916]  It's going to be federally mandated guidelines, by the way.
[00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:21.037]  Federally mandated guidelines.
[00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:22.357]  But via the states, correct?
[00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:27.190]  Well, it's the federal government dictating to every doctor in every state that they must do this.
[00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.931]  Now, Ron, you're a retired police officer.
[00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:48.776]  What do you think of, meanwhile, the doctor's got to spy on you, got to take your bodily fluids for Uncle Sam, got to do all this Big Brother stuff, tattle on your neighbors, spy on your parents if you're in public schools, get prizes, but the president calls the Minutemen vigilantes and reports their every movement
[00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:55.031]  Using the military, the border patrol, and the FBI to the Mexican troops who openly deal drugs and kill cops.
[00:36:55.671 --> 00:37:06.935]  Oh, what I think is that it's time for us as American people to realize that the government of this country is not 365 people who sit in Washington, but 280 million people who reside in the country.
[00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:12.516]  And once we become conscious of that fact, then maybe we could begin to take our country back.
[00:37:13.317 --> 00:37:14.597]  Well, it's simple.
[00:37:14.997 --> 00:37:16.858]  I mean, give us your take.
[00:37:16.918 --> 00:37:17.638]  Why do you think
[00:37:18.533 --> 00:37:22.874]  They are so hell-bent on stopping the Minutemen and are helping our enemies defeat them.
[00:37:23.315 --> 00:37:27.296]  Well, because it interferes with their plan for this country.
[00:37:27.356 --> 00:37:37.819]  I believe that they do want to basically erase the borders, turn this into nothing more than a transnational economic zone, an international territory to be used.
[00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:39.219]  To be used!
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.120]  Yeah, basically a toilet.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.100]  The world's toilet.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:42.721]  That's it.
[00:37:42.801 --> 00:37:44.021]  To turn you into a toilet.
[00:37:44.953 --> 00:37:47.674]  And these guys, of course, interfere with that.
[00:37:47.774 --> 00:37:49.996]  They raise conscientiousness about this.
[00:37:50.496 --> 00:37:52.337]  And that's why they're trying to demonize them.
[00:37:52.897 --> 00:37:55.638]  I mean, even to the point that they're letting the Mexican government know?
[00:37:56.259 --> 00:38:05.423]  The so-called American government, and you must always use these terms, so-called American government, is telling the Mexican government where American citizens are?
[00:38:06.135 --> 00:38:11.177]  Trying to protect the borders and, in fact, enforce the statutory laws of the United States.
[00:38:11.237 --> 00:38:16.499]  And in the meanwhile, inside the country, training us all how to be tattletales.
[00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:17.439]  That's right.
[00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:19.660]  We're in bad times and we're in danger.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.140]  Look at this.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.601]  You mentioned that thing about Rupert Murdoch and Hillary, right?
[00:38:23.541 --> 00:38:31.324]  Now, for years and years, Rupert Murdoch has always been posed to us, this Australian editor of a newspaper and owner of Fox News,
[00:38:32.405 --> 00:38:38.792]  Uh, as you know, this great Bubba good ol' boy right winger, and he's holding a campaign fundraiser for Hillary.
[00:38:38.972 --> 00:38:42.576]  One of the most infamous political figures in the history of the country in the last hundred years.
[00:38:43.584 --> 00:39:03.834]  And you're right, we're going to have that phony, we're going to have that phony Hannity, eventually probably get on the air, whack-a-head phony, patent leather phony, and then try to twist and turn and spin things so that all of a sudden you're going to be made to look at Hillary Clinton like she's, you know, this fine Reaganite conservative.
[00:39:04.474 --> 00:39:05.255]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:39:05.275 --> 00:39:05.895]  So we've got to
[00:39:06.883 --> 00:39:08.123]  Well, they're already doing that.
[00:39:08.143 --> 00:39:11.224]  They've already got the neocons with their talking points saying, look at Hillary.
[00:39:11.264 --> 00:39:13.085]  She's come over to sanity.
[00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:14.905]  She's doing the right thing.
[00:39:15.285 --> 00:39:17.906]  Even Hillary, but the evil liberals don't like her.
[00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:18.766]  Why?
[00:39:19.286 --> 00:39:19.607]  Why?
[00:39:19.787 --> 00:39:21.407]  George Clooney doesn't like her.
[00:39:21.487 --> 00:39:24.568]  So if you don't like Hillary, you're a liberal.
[00:39:24.748 --> 00:39:25.908]  Yeah, you're a liberal.
[00:39:25.988 --> 00:39:26.889]  They're already doing it.
[00:39:26.909 --> 00:39:28.229]  I mean, I don't know if you've been tuning in.
[00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:29.829]  They're already doing it!
[00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:38.891]  Look, we're liberals because we don't want to turn our guns in, and we don't want our borders open, and we don't like Bush spending more money than all presidents combined, and we don't like him signing U.N.
[00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:47.893]  treaties, and we don't like him attacking innocent countries, and we don't like him setting up domestic CIA, and we don't like the head of the NSA saying there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:39:48.133 --> 00:39:49.373]  I mean, these people are sick!
[00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:51.533]  But there's an easier way to say it than that.
[00:39:51.793 --> 00:39:55.494]  I don't want to turn my soul over to people who have no souls at all.
[00:39:56.235 --> 00:39:57.316]  That's what I don't want to do.
[00:39:57.436 --> 00:40:03.939]  Hillary Clinton is a monster and no matter how much perfume these neocons put on her, she's still a fat pig.
[00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:04.699]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:05.700]  You're welcome.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.721]  And I don't mean that physically a fat pig.
[00:40:07.761 --> 00:40:10.402]  I mean her soul is a big fat pig goblin.
[00:40:10.962 --> 00:40:12.323]  I mean she makes me sick!
[00:40:13.764 --> 00:40:13.884]  Ugh!
[00:40:13.904 --> 00:40:15.605]  I can't stand Hillary Clinton!
[00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:17.946]  I wish they could just go away.
[00:40:18.206 --> 00:40:19.066]  I've got some good news.
[00:40:19.126 --> 00:40:20.027]  Clinton was up speaking.
[00:40:20.882 --> 00:40:28.991]  Or was it in Ohio, just a few days ago, and the hall held, I think it was 2,000 people, the news article said, and only like 700 showed up?
[00:40:29.852 --> 00:40:34.077]  I mean, I could go to a speaking engagement at a college and 2,000 would show up!
[00:40:34.657 --> 00:40:34.817]  Huh!
[00:40:35.078 --> 00:40:35.758]  Bill Clinton!
[00:40:35.778 --> 00:40:36.579]  I mean, I'm nobody!
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.520]  It's good!
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.643]  You're a piece of garbage, Bill Clinton!
[00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:42.162]  And I don't care if George Bush Sr.
[00:40:42.182 --> 00:40:43.162]  and George Jr.
[00:40:43.202 --> 00:40:43.882]  say you're great.
[00:40:44.102 --> 00:40:45.823]  You're not great, and they're not great either.
[00:40:46.403 --> 00:40:48.324]  I know I'm a liberal because I don't love them!
[00:40:48.644 --> 00:40:50.705]  You stupid neocons out there!
[00:40:50.925 --> 00:40:52.205]  You people are scum!
[00:40:53.866 --> 00:40:55.026]  Oh man, we're in trouble.
[00:40:55.606 --> 00:40:56.627]  I'm sorry, I'm getting real mad.
[00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:59.008]  I just am so sick of Hillary Clinton.
[00:40:59.368 --> 00:41:03.529]  I'm so sick of her, and I'm so sick of all the things she tried to do with this country.
[00:41:04.049 --> 00:41:08.611]  Communist medicine, which is for the bankers, handing over everything to them, not for you, the people.
[00:41:09.686 --> 00:41:24.475]  Just all the gun control, the open borders, the Christmas trees with crack pipes on them, the Jorge Cabrera known convicted cocaine dealers giving her money at the White House, communist generals in the White House selling out our secrets.
[00:41:26.556 --> 00:41:28.397]  I mean, making me sick.
[00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:31.178]  And now we're evil liberals.
[00:41:31.639 --> 00:41:32.099]  I've heard them.
[00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:34.540]  What do you mean, Ron, they're going to be saying that?
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.741]  They're already doing it!
[00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:42.590]  Oh, it's just, it's just, there's no end to it.
[00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.031]  There's no end.
[00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:47.572]  Mark in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:50.313]  Hi Alex, this is Mark from Northeast Wisconsin.
[00:41:51.013 --> 00:41:55.375]  I got a pub story where I didn't get beat up like that guy you were talking to yesterday there.
[00:41:56.415 --> 00:42:06.019]  And, uh, what happened was I was bringing up 9-11 and, you know, the facts about the buildings and cell phones don't work up, you know, up 30,000 feet.
[00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:12.355]  And I was getting reneged by this gentleman alongside of me and he seemed quite intelligent.
[00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:21.402]  We were talking quite a while and then after quite a few beers he opened up a little bit and I opened up and I asked him, uh, where'd you retire from?
[00:42:22.663 --> 00:42:25.205]  He got kind of quiet and then he answered, well, you're not going to believe this.
[00:42:25.265 --> 00:42:27.226]  I retired from the NSA after 30 years.
[00:42:28.447 --> 00:42:33.331]  So the first word that came out of my mouth was Echelon and he got that look on his face like David Gergen there.
[00:42:34.412 --> 00:42:37.394]  And, uh, and I brought up some facts about that and he says, well,
[00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:43.654]  You're right about a lot of that and there's a lot of things I can't talk about because I'm still under oath even after I'm retired.
[00:42:43.714 --> 00:42:52.681]  The guy pretty much tried to put me down and I brought up the number 7 building there and he didn't seem to remember that that went down in the afternoon.
[00:42:53.682 --> 00:43:02.148]  But he said the cell phones do work about 30,000 feet and those buildings fell from the hot flames and on and on.
[00:43:02.348 --> 00:43:04.450]  Cell phones admittedly don't work at 30,000 feet.
[00:43:06.821 --> 00:43:07.162]  I don't know.
[00:43:24.362 --> 00:43:29.206]  Shielding around the plane, there's so much movement in the signal, it breaks up then.
[00:43:29.246 --> 00:43:31.448]  It breaks up immediately on takeoff.
[00:43:31.488 --> 00:43:35.672]  But they've done studies, 2000 is the maximum ceiling with the cell phones.
[00:43:35.732 --> 00:43:37.954]  It's just, it's total bull.
[00:43:37.994 --> 00:43:46.441]  But for those that don't know, I said I'd have the article, a little blurb up, just the basics, that there in South Carolina, a veteran,
[00:43:47.498 --> 00:44:08.276]  That was simply sitting at the bar table, you know, on the stool, brought up 9-11, brought up some films he'd seen, the man he was talking to agreed with him, and the head of the hall came up and said, get out of here, and he said, no I have a right, and sat back down, and they assaulted him, the guy was arrested, along with three other guys, but they haven't been arrested yet, and
[00:44:11.314 --> 00:44:13.496]  The crazy part is they then banned him.
[00:44:13.536 --> 00:44:17.678]  The person that assaulted him then banned him from that VFW hall.
[00:44:18.198 --> 00:44:22.581]  And so we put a little report up last night, but it had a typo or two in it, so I pulled it this morning.
[00:44:22.961 --> 00:44:23.662]  We're fixing it.
[00:44:23.682 --> 00:44:29.505]  It's really a piece of cake article, but it'll be up there soon on Infowars.com.
[00:44:30.045 --> 00:44:31.106]  And it's just outrageous.
[00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:32.427]  What did you think when you heard that story?
[00:44:33.107 --> 00:44:33.748]  Oh, it's just...
[00:44:35.143 --> 00:44:38.484]  It totally blew my mind because they're a little bit more gentlemanly up here in Wisconsin.
[00:44:38.524 --> 00:44:39.684]  There was no problem like that.
[00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:43.765]  A lot of people were kind of listening in and thought I was a conspiracy nut and whatnot.
[00:44:44.485 --> 00:44:50.447]  But then I kind of changed the talk a little bit and I brought up what about the torture and all that.
[00:44:50.967 --> 00:45:01.729]  This gentleman, he was absolutely against torture completely and he had a friend that still works for the CIA and he's an interrogator and his friend, they're absolutely against this torture.
[00:45:01.749 --> 00:45:02.850]  He says it does not work.
[00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.590]  You will not get a decent confession.
[00:45:05.489 --> 00:45:07.431]  So he agreed with me on that and then he... No, no, no.
[00:45:07.731 --> 00:45:10.534]  Giving people cigarettes and beer gets the confession.
[00:45:10.654 --> 00:45:16.539]  Giving their friends, and they have whole, you know, encyclopedic textbooks on this.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:24.246]  Well, the beer opened up, you know, got us talking and then we had a really gentleman conversation for about three hours and he brought up the Upper Peninsula of Michigan here.
[00:45:24.266 --> 00:45:30.031]  There's some really nasty jailing going on up there and I don't know if there's one of those concentration sites in the UP or not, but...
[00:45:30.836 --> 00:45:39.985]  Kind of like what it sounded like, and he was absolutely against us jailing people for... Sir, they have black sites all over the U.S., black world sites all over Europe, it's admitted.
[00:45:40.385 --> 00:45:41.186]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:42.047 --> 00:45:44.169]  Exciting phone call to hear those folks were waking up.
[00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:45.934]  Well, you know, that's the thing.
[00:45:45.994 --> 00:45:53.118]  The only thing torture works for is terror, is fear in the general population, and for false confessions.
[00:45:53.218 --> 00:45:55.519]  It does not get you good intelligence.
[00:45:55.599 --> 00:45:56.339]  It never has.
[00:45:56.419 --> 00:45:57.080]  It never will.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.080]  History shows that.
[00:45:58.521 --> 00:46:00.962]  We've interviewed top interrogators on this program.
[00:46:01.482 --> 00:46:03.123]  It does not work.
[00:46:05.244 --> 00:46:07.485]  All it does is ensure that your troops get tortured.
[00:46:07.586 --> 00:46:10.087]  Because what are we going to do next time somebody grabs our troops and tortures them?
[00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:14.275]  He'll go, how dare the enemy torture them, that's incredibly evil!
[00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:17.335]  Saddam tortured, he had rape rooms!
[00:46:17.935 --> 00:46:20.756]  Yeah, our government trained Saddam, that's declassified.
[00:46:21.236 --> 00:46:24.877]  Trained by the CIA for two years, 1958 to 1960.
[00:46:26.137 --> 00:46:29.398]  Head of Ba'athist security, put into power in 1969.
[00:46:29.478 --> 00:46:31.058]  Coup d'etat in 1979.
[00:46:31.638 --> 00:46:35.739]  A few months later they launched the attack on Iran, all staged by our government.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.463]  And the President of Iran put that in his grievance.
[00:46:40.503 --> 00:46:42.524]  He said, you overthrew our government in 1953.
[00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:48.129]  He didn't even mention when our government admits they carried out terror attacks to do it, to blame it on Mossadegh.
[00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:56.176]  Blew up our own jetliners, blew up our own ships, tried to constantly overthrow our country, put sanctions on us.
[00:46:57.237 --> 00:47:04.424]  By the way, our government admittedly right now, the illegitimate government, admittedly for a year has special forces troops in Iran, foreign troops,
[00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:09.781]  And they say that when Israel attacks Iran, that if they fight back, they're evil.
[00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:11.681]  Now, I mean, can you imagine?
[00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:14.882]  We're going to attack you, and you don't fight back, okay?
[00:47:14.922 --> 00:47:15.442]  Or you're bad.
[00:47:17.223 --> 00:47:18.603]  Let's talk to Tom in Tennessee.
[00:47:18.623 --> 00:47:19.224]  Tom, welcome.
[00:47:19.884 --> 00:47:20.584]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.224]  You're on the roll today.
[00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:28.807]  I was talking to someone yesterday, and I'm a relatively new listener, and he asked a question I couldn't answer.
[00:47:28.827 --> 00:47:29.567]  I was wondering if you could help me.
[00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:37.232]  I was presenting facts like Norad staying down and several of the others with Giuliani and 15 Minutes getting out of the building and everything.
[00:47:37.792 --> 00:47:56.476]  He asked me about, this actually goes along with the cell phone calls, he said, so what were the moms making it up when their sons, when they had the recordings of their sons calling and when they went on and were doing books and things like that about their sons calling and leaving messages, hearing their voices.
[00:47:57.265 --> 00:48:04.509]  And I wasn't sure if that was staged or whether they were able to use the computer software to generate those voices somehow.
[00:48:04.689 --> 00:48:09.652]  Is it similar to Tau 007 when they said that the Russians had shot them down?
[00:48:09.992 --> 00:48:14.274]  I'm wondering about the similarities and how I can actually answer the questions.
[00:48:15.012 --> 00:48:18.873]  That seemed to be legitimate when face value.
[00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:29.816]  We're hearing all these questions because people go into a dark movie theater, they're hypnotized, they focus on the big luminous screen, and they suspend disbelief, and they absorb what they see as reality.
[00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:30.457]  Okay?
[00:48:31.417 --> 00:48:35.838]  Now, bottom line, I answered this question actually yesterday, but I'll do it again.
[00:48:35.858 --> 00:48:38.039]  I'm getting this question every day now, and that's fine.
[00:48:38.059 --> 00:48:42.240]  In fact, I even got it around the same time of the show, but I'll answer it again.
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.781]  No, no, that's an important question.
[00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:44.641]  I'm glad you're asking it.
[00:48:46.249 --> 00:48:50.632]  The official story they tell us from end to end is a fraud.
[00:48:51.712 --> 00:48:55.034]  We know that the official story we've been given is a lie.
[00:48:55.074 --> 00:48:57.155]  They've changed it so many times it's ridiculous.
[00:48:57.756 --> 00:49:06.921]  We then know that the Arabs couldn't have NORAD stand down, couldn't put bombs in the buildings, couldn't warn public officials not to fly, couldn't have the war games that day.
[00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:10.323]  Bin Laden's known CIA on and on and on.
[00:49:10.443 --> 00:49:12.024]  CIA insider trading.
[00:49:14.388 --> 00:49:19.989]  Israeli employees of Odigo, this is Associated Press, it's not an urban legend, being told, get out of the building, Odigo admits that.
[00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.930]  Hundreds and hundreds of points.
[00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.150]  Hundreds of points.
[00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:24.731]  Hundreds of points.
[00:49:26.211 --> 00:49:31.592]  And then we know cell phones don't work at above 2,000 feet.
[00:49:32.312 --> 00:49:42.795]  Then we know that there's open market, inexpensive IBM software now available that industry had decades ago, where if you had a recording of Alex Jones talking,
[00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:44.295]  I think it only takes about a minute.
[00:49:44.335 --> 00:49:46.137]  I heard you talk about that yesterday.
[00:49:46.177 --> 00:49:47.538]  Well then you heard me answer the question.
[00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:49.641]  What do you want me to answer?
[00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:52.443]  Let me just finish for those that just joined.
[00:49:52.524 --> 00:49:54.646]  I need to answer the question since you brought it up again.
[00:49:54.706 --> 00:49:55.407]  I am answering it.
[00:49:56.307 --> 00:49:59.811]  If you had a minute of Alex Jones talking, you voice print that in the computer program.
[00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:00.592]  It's inexpensive now.
[00:50:00.612 --> 00:50:01.873]  I can buy this.
[00:50:02.093 --> 00:50:02.674]  You can buy this.
[00:50:03.735 --> 00:50:04.476]  And then you get
[00:50:05.248 --> 00:50:14.559]  You put it through the computer and then you talk real time into a microphone and it comes out the other end and can be sent down a phone line and it will fool a voice print computer!
[00:50:16.261 --> 00:50:16.521]  Okay?
[00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:17.923]  It will fool anyone!
[00:50:18.573 --> 00:50:19.574]  And then it gets even easier.
[00:50:19.594 --> 00:50:22.217]  You get these phone calls to answering machines.
[00:50:22.698 --> 00:50:23.519]  I'm on the phone.
[00:50:23.679 --> 00:50:24.319]  Hijackers.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.401]  They've got bombs.
[00:50:26.121 --> 00:50:31.688]  They actually had to get the people's voices and then use it and generate that.
[00:50:31.708 --> 00:50:33.930]  Yes, but they don't have to have their voices saying it exactly.
[00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:37.314]  They can get a phone print, record the person, the target,
[00:50:37.994 --> 00:50:38.095]  Oh.
[00:50:38.215 --> 00:50:48.404]  Okay, and in real time, even if you say, you know, you're an NSA spook, you're a private contractor now, black world op, running it via satellite phone out of, say, Wiesbaden, Germany.
[00:50:49.065 --> 00:50:52.308]  You call, Mama even answers, and you go, Mama, it's me.
[00:50:52.548 --> 00:50:53.810]  They've hijacked, it's on the plane.
[00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.733]  And when she hears it, it's, hey Mama, I'm in trouble.
[00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:59.615]  See, it's precise.
[00:51:00.156 --> 00:51:01.197]  We'll be right back, stay there.
[00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:05.493]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.753 --> 00:51:07.334]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.674 --> 00:51:12.357]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.698 --> 00:51:19.422]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.762 --> 00:51:21.723]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:24.784]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.884 --> 00:51:29.526]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.747 --> 00:51:34.149]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.389 --> 00:51:41.612]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:54:07.613 --> 00:54:09.294]  This story broke yesterday on air.
[00:54:09.334 --> 00:54:11.696]  We're posting it on Infowars.com right now.
[00:54:11.776 --> 00:54:16.759]  Veteran assaulted and banned by VFW Post for questioning official 9-11 story.
[00:54:18.231 --> 00:54:19.672]  by Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes.
[00:54:20.192 --> 00:54:28.758]  An American patriot who served in combat was allegedly assaulted April 1st 2006 at a VFW post 445 for voicing comments.
[00:54:29.779 --> 00:54:41.626]  Richard Scram has been arrested and charged for allegedly assaulting photographer mate second-class Mark Dury in Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:54:41.726 --> 00:54:45.729]  Dury indicated that he required medical attention for his
[00:54:46.554 --> 00:54:46.995]  Injuries.
[00:54:47.035 --> 00:54:48.857]  And he's going to send us a photograph of that.
[00:54:49.778 --> 00:54:55.566]  He reported to us, we should add, that he was assaulted and the police have confirmed that.
[00:54:55.606 --> 00:55:02.815]  We've talked to them and we've got the arrest reports up on the article that we posted on JonesReport.com going up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:55:03.336 --> 00:55:04.096]  Subsequently,
[00:55:05.279 --> 00:55:15.047]  Durie has had his canteen privileges suspended and may be permanently barred from the locale for his role in the incident on April 1st, 2006.
[00:55:15.207 --> 00:55:25.155]  This is ironic since Durie was allegedly assaulted by Schramm, who was the post commander and is now its quartermaster.
[00:55:25.175 --> 00:55:28.238]  There was an election last night and they removed him as commander.
[00:55:28.278 --> 00:55:29.399]  He's now quartermaster.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:41.010]  This very person who was charged for assaulting Mr. DeRee has been barred from the VFW post, which DeRee has a right to frequent as a dues-paying veteran.
[00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:52.341]  So the very person that allegedly assaulted Mr. DeRee, who's been charged with it, is the very one that barred him from being able to go back to the VFW.
[00:55:52.641 --> 00:55:55.884]  And we have all the documents and all the arrest history there.
[00:55:57.156 --> 00:56:04.901]  The circumstances, the reason I'm babbling through this is the printer printed this so small that even with 20-20 vision I'm having to focus to read this.
[00:56:05.581 --> 00:56:08.202]  These circumstances are very dangerous for free speech.
[00:56:08.383 --> 00:56:10.724]  It is one of the most important
[00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:17.695]  It is of the utmost importance that Mark Dury has his access to the VFW Post 445 reinstated.
[00:56:17.775 --> 00:56:27.202]  Otherwise, it is a precedent that a citizen of the United States can be first assaulted for voicing his views and then punished for creating a quote, incident.
[00:56:27.923 --> 00:56:35.769]  According to the account of Mr. Dury, he was considering problems with the official 9-11 story and discussing such films
[00:56:36.718 --> 00:56:40.302]  As Marshall Law, 9-11, rise of the police state, loose change.
[00:56:40.783 --> 00:56:44.447]  Again, on air he said loose change, but we talked to him further.
[00:56:44.507 --> 00:56:47.431]  He was talking about a lot of 9-11 stuff and Marshall Law, so we added that.
[00:56:48.252 --> 00:56:52.797]  Scram and others at the VFW's canteen overheard him and told him to shut up or get out.
[00:56:53.158 --> 00:56:55.761]  When Uri refused, Scram
[00:56:56.582 --> 00:57:03.847]  Allegedly attacked him from behind, then knocked Doree to the floor, where he was reportedly kicked and stomped by upwards of four individuals.
[00:57:04.528 --> 00:57:08.191]  Richard Schramm could not be reached for comment Tuesday or Wednesday.
[00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:13.935]  An attempt was also made to reach the arresting officer, who was not reached for comment either, but the police department was.
[00:57:13.975 --> 00:57:15.116]  We did talk to the police department.
[00:57:15.456 --> 00:57:17.717]  The phone number for the VFW, we have that posted.
[00:57:18.137 --> 00:57:31.381]  And the Charleston County Court websites list Mr. Schramm's recent arrests that include, since 2000, not only the charge of assault and battery from this incident, but also DUI, reckless driving, and gambling, and unlawful games.
[00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:34.762]  And we have copies of all of those up there on the site.
[00:57:34.802 --> 00:57:37.003]  We'll start the second hour
[00:57:38.186 --> 00:57:48.169]  Get into Iran, get into the President's letter to our President, who literally was just totally undiplomatic, and we'll get to all of your calls for those of you that are holding.
[00:57:48.209 --> 00:57:56.731]  Before I end this hour and the next 30 seconds, we've got a big 9-11 event with the top speakers and myself, and my new film will be screened there first.
[00:57:57.191 --> 00:58:00.132]  June 24th and 25th, downtown LA at the Sheraton.
[00:58:00.472 --> 00:58:02.673]  Go to InfoWars.com to secure your tickets.
[00:58:03.033 --> 00:58:05.954]  We are now reaching two-tenths of the tickets being sold.
[00:58:06.494 --> 00:58:12.139]  Or 20% of the tickets being gone 40-something days away from the conference.

[00:58:36.303 --> 00:58:38.205]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:38.726]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:46.136]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7600.
[00:58:57.635 --> 00:58:58.277]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.938 --> 00:59:00.001]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.722 --> 00:59:01.825]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.486 --> 00:59:03.248]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:04.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:09.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.783 --> 00:59:13.906]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:28.457]  Neil Young, who put out the Let's Roll song cashing in after 9-11 buying into the official fraud, has now gone public that he's been conned about the war and a lot more.
[00:59:29.267 --> 00:59:32.348]  I first had a chance last night to hear a few of the songs online.
[00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:36.450]  We're going to play one of them, The Secret Garden, later in this hour.
[00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:47.455]  We have the Director, the Founder of Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownership, Aaron Zellman, joining us to talk about some really scary gun control coming down the Federal Pike, coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:59:47.475 --> 00:59:56.819]  We'll take your calls right now, get into the Iran situation, this letter from their President to our President that was treated with the utmost of disrespect.
[00:59:57.529 --> 01:00:07.477]  I mean, even if Iran's evil and our government's loving and good, you still consider a letter, especially one that's gracious, calling Bush's excellency and stuff?
[01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:09.458]  It's just disgusting.
[01:00:09.498 --> 01:00:11.720]  So we'll get into that as well.
[01:00:12.841 --> 01:00:17.064]  And going up on Infowars.com in the next few minutes, we're going to have the article about a veteran.
[01:00:17.445 --> 01:00:25.551]  We have the police reports assaulted for simply talking about 9-11 being an inside job, and then banned from the VFW Hall by the very person that assaulted him.
[01:00:26.906 --> 01:00:29.307]  So this is quite rich.
[01:00:29.387 --> 01:00:33.509]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:00:33.669 --> 01:00:37.390]  Let's talk to Mike in North Carolina.
[01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:38.291]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:38.671]  Welcome.
[01:00:39.031 --> 01:00:39.471]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:40.592 --> 01:00:54.417]  First thing, this past semester, I'm a community college teacher, and I've screened American Dictators, Loose Change, Second Edition, and Painful Deceptions to my students, and I probably had a 90-95% wake-up rate.
[01:00:57.882 --> 01:00:58.462]  Unbelievable!
[01:00:58.763 --> 01:01:17.243]  Yeah, yeah, and I spent about 15-20 minutes per class throughout the course of the semester leading up to the documentary unit just going over the news off PrisonPlanet.com, WhatReallyHappened.com and I really think that helped set the stage for such an unprecedented wake-up rate amongst my students.
[01:01:18.067 --> 01:01:19.448]  So, congratulations.
[01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.090]  No, congratulations to you!
[01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.810]  Are you kidding?
[01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:25.813]  Did you get any feedback from other administrators or anybody?
[01:01:26.094 --> 01:01:32.038]  No, I'm very surprised with the amount of autonomy that I was granted.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.821]  None of the students complained.
[01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:40.705]  I think that they understood that I was just trying to get them to think.
[01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:43.828]  Whether or not they agreed with me or not,
[01:01:44.554 --> 01:01:45.534]  They knew I didn't care.
[01:01:45.554 --> 01:01:47.975]  I was just trying to... Did you hold some type of vote?
[01:01:48.075 --> 01:01:50.696]  All of those that think it was an inside job, raise your hand.
[01:01:51.237 --> 01:01:56.258]  No, what it was is I had them, because we spent about six weeks... Oh yeah, write a report on it.
[01:01:56.319 --> 01:02:06.042]  Yeah, they had to write a summary on Super Size Me, then one on Walmart for the Enron documentary, and then one of their choice.
[01:02:06.803 --> 01:02:13.145]  And a lot chose to write about loose change, and everything came back just totally positive.
[01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:16.414]  I'll tell you, that is so exciting.
[01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:26.640]  Yeah, and then my other comment that I wanted to make is, has a caller called in about the new industrial metal outfit, Ministry, putting their new album out?
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:33.844]  I'm told that Ministry is doing a music video, Dylan Avery is.
[01:02:34.624 --> 01:02:34.984]  Oh really?
[01:02:35.004 --> 01:02:39.447]  Yeah, because I know this new album... It's about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:40.007]  Totally.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:54.849]  Seventy, eighty percent of the songs are about either Bush or Bin Laden, the war in Iraq, and it's just a total of sixty minutes of hardcore political trash.
[01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:57.330]  It's awesome.
[01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:01.713]  Well, you know, Ministry, fifteen years ago, had a song that would go, New World Order.
[01:03:02.254 --> 01:03:03.154]  It would have Bush Sr.
[01:03:03.174 --> 01:03:04.055]  sing New World Order.
[01:03:04.505 --> 01:03:10.610]  And I was wondering, would it be alright if I just took another moment or two and read out some of the lyrical passages that I've assembled?
[01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:11.230]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:03:11.451 --> 01:03:14.213]  Okay, the first one is from a song called Butt Clowns.
[01:03:14.433 --> 01:03:15.834]  I've had to censor this a little bit.
[01:03:17.015 --> 01:03:25.421]  And the lines in this one go, I want to go to the circus, the circus of power, the circus they call Washington, a circle of dishonor.
[01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:31.006]  I want to round up the senators just like they did in Rome, feed these butt clowns to the lions, then I can go home.
[01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.211]  And, uh, there's just a whole bunch of just gold and political lyrics on this album.
[01:03:35.451 --> 01:03:36.551]  Is that album out yet?
[01:03:36.831 --> 01:03:38.312]  Yes, it came out on the 2nd of May.
[01:03:38.392 --> 01:03:39.112]  What's the name of it?
[01:03:39.512 --> 01:03:40.493]  Rio Grande Blood.
[01:03:41.413 --> 01:03:42.393]  Rio Grande Blood.
[01:03:42.413 --> 01:03:44.174]  I'll have to get a copy.
[01:03:44.194 --> 01:03:45.434]  Maybe we'll play some of it.
[01:03:45.474 --> 01:03:46.314]  Alright, thank you.
[01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:48.575]  Very exciting call as well.
[01:03:49.055 --> 01:03:51.196]  More calls, more news, straight ahead.
[01:03:51.276 --> 01:03:52.376]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.456 --> 01:04:00.283]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:01.965]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.165 --> 01:04:04.368]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.528 --> 01:04:06.610]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:11.815]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.176 --> 01:04:16.200]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.221]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.281 --> 01:04:28.929]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:30.990]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:35.053]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the Info War.

[01:05:07.764 --> 01:05:19.288]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.

[01:05:51.702 --> 01:05:58.706]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:08.746 --> 01:06:09.527]  We're good to go.
[01:06:26.218 --> 01:06:26.538]  I think so.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.624]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.244 --> 01:07:04.226]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:23.078 --> 01:07:24.199]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:07:24.259 --> 01:07:34.267]  Aaron Zellman, Judge of Preservation of Firearms Ownership, is coming up here in about 22 minutes to talk about some new gun control legislation, and then he's a reporter who's been inside Fallujah during the war.
[01:07:34.367 --> 01:07:36.669]  He's been all over Iraq and the Middle East many times.
[01:07:36.689 --> 01:07:43.655]  Dar Jamal, he was just here last night in Austin giving a speech, and he'll be joining us again coming up in the next hour.
[01:07:44.836 --> 01:07:50.741]  For those that just joined us, we covered an Associated Press report about how the Mexican government brags, and our government admits,
[01:07:52.122 --> 01:08:00.219]  That the Border Patrol and others surveil the Minutemen and tell the Mexican troops and government their exact location at all times.
[01:08:02.902 --> 01:08:21.877]  Meanwhile, the government encourages American citizens to tattle on each other for anything and everything, but citizens peacefully calling the Border Patrol when they see hordes of illegal aliens and criminal smugglers, while their evil vigilantes in the Mexican government takes pot shots at them, routinely shoots at them, and has killed many police officers and others, but that's okay.
[01:08:22.258 --> 01:08:23.378]  Mexico's our friend.
[01:08:23.438 --> 01:08:24.239]  It's outrageous.
[01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:30.144]  Meanwhile, a few days ago, I'm sure most of you are aware, the President of
[01:08:31.079 --> 01:08:37.062]  Iran sent a letter via the Swiss Embassy to Condoleezza Rice and President Bush.
[01:08:38.143 --> 01:08:42.926]  And I suggest you just type letter from Iranian President to President Bush into Google.
[01:08:43.326 --> 01:08:45.027]  You can read the actual letter itself.
[01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:48.649]  It is a groveling letter.
[01:08:49.169 --> 01:08:55.813]  He is begging Bush to be Christian and he is begging Bush to not attack them.
[01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:57.934]  He is telling Bush that he's a great
[01:08:58.704 --> 01:09:11.618]  A leader, that he's an excellency, and that they just want to live in peace, and that they forgive us, basically, for overthrowing their country in 53, which was a pro-America peaceful government, by the way.
[01:09:12.138 --> 01:09:17.163]  Our government carried out terror attacks, to blame it on Mosaddegh, that's admittedly classified, CIA.gov.
[01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:23.392]  And he brings up how we blew up their jetliners, and how we've had sanctions on them, and all of this.
[01:09:23.452 --> 01:09:31.618]  An Iranian's never done this, and geopolitical experts, even conservative experts, who've studied the Persians, looked at this and they said, this is unprecedented.
[01:09:32.258 --> 01:09:37.142]  This is major face loss for him, especially since Bush snubbed it.
[01:09:37.902 --> 01:09:39.123]  These are very proud people.
[01:09:39.163 --> 01:09:41.825]  This is unheard of, unprecedented, never happened.
[01:09:42.598 --> 01:09:44.699]  Rice was very arrogant, giggled about it.
[01:09:45.079 --> 01:09:46.700]  I've got our Schneid comments here.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.761]  This is nothing new.
[01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:48.921]  This is blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:50.762]  This is manipulative.
[01:09:51.322 --> 01:09:53.023]  We're not even responding to it.
[01:09:55.044 --> 01:09:57.725]  This is Iran trying to put out the olive branch.
[01:09:58.026 --> 01:10:00.787]  And by the way, Iran has never said they'd wipe Israel off the map.
[01:10:01.227 --> 01:10:03.969]  Iran has said if they're attacked, they will wipe it off the map.
[01:10:04.009 --> 01:10:05.189]  And Israel said that back.
[01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:10.792]  After Israel a few months ago said, we will attack you with nukes, they said, okay, well we'll wipe you off the map too.
[01:10:11.644 --> 01:10:18.369]  When Bush and Cheney and Bolton said, we'll cause you great pain and suffering, they said, well, please don't do that.
[01:10:18.429 --> 01:10:19.630]  We want to work things out with you.
[01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:23.013]  I read the actual quotes by the president of Iran.
[01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.955]  Please don't do that, but we can also cause you great pain and suffering.
[01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:30.359]  Well, our media took it and just, Iranian president, we'll cause you great pain and suffering.
[01:10:33.241 --> 01:10:36.444]  That's like if I say, I'm coming over to your house and I'm going to kill you.
[01:10:37.478 --> 01:10:39.940]  And you say, over my dead body, I'm going to fight back.
[01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:42.363]  It might just be you that's pushing daisies.
[01:10:43.224 --> 01:10:45.105]  Alex Jones threatened me.
[01:10:45.186 --> 01:10:46.467]  Can you believe it?
[01:10:47.167 --> 01:10:55.195]  But again, we have an American people, two-thirds of which can't find Iraq or Iran or India or Pakistan on a map.
[01:10:55.255 --> 01:10:56.136]  I mean, how do you miss India?
[01:10:56.196 --> 01:10:56.797]  It sticks out.
[01:10:57.992 --> 01:11:07.900]  The vast majority of Americans don't know how many continents there are, and I talk about this every year, that they just had the same big National Geography study of college graduates and college students.
[01:11:09.202 --> 01:11:10.843]  You get the same numbers with adults.
[01:11:11.564 --> 01:11:14.606]  I mean, I'll have debates with adults who have multiple degrees.
[01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:19.250]  I'll be arguing with somebody at a coffee shop or, you know, at the grocery store.
[01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.573]  Every once in a while they'll walk over and argue, and they'll always laugh.
[01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:25.427]  Man, you make up a lot of stuff.
[01:11:27.528 --> 01:11:30.870]  You claim there's cross-species, genetic-engineered species.
[01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:32.830]  There's no such thing.
[01:11:32.911 --> 01:11:34.011]  I took biology.
[01:11:34.031 --> 01:11:35.592]  I go, when did you take it?
[01:11:35.852 --> 01:11:36.412]  20 years ago?
[01:11:36.472 --> 01:11:38.053]  Well, yeah, I was 76.
[01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:44.296]  Well, just type spider goats into Google and you'll get CBS Nightly News.
[01:11:44.356 --> 01:11:45.677]  I mean, it's admitted, sir.
[01:11:45.757 --> 01:11:47.778]  Most of the foods we eat are cross-species.
[01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:49.419]  That's a lie.
[01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:50.799]  I used to respect you.
[01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:51.439]  I don't now.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.260]  You're a liar.
[01:11:53.667 --> 01:11:55.168]  Okay, fine, thank you.
[01:11:56.029 --> 01:11:58.250]  Or a guy, some yuppie will ride by on some $50,000 Harley.
[01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.452]  This has happened like twice.
[01:12:00.472 --> 01:12:03.634]  They'll go, hey punk, keep talking about your black helicopters.
[01:12:04.155 --> 01:12:06.576]  And I'll go, hey, excuse me, why don't you come back and argue about it?
[01:12:07.297 --> 01:12:09.478]  I might get off this cycle and do something else.
[01:12:09.498 --> 01:12:12.561]  And of course my eyes start bugging out of my head and they just ride off.
[01:12:14.562 --> 01:12:16.664]  But the point here is, is I'm sick of it.
[01:12:16.804 --> 01:12:18.745]  I'm tired of you being dumb.
[01:12:20.006 --> 01:12:21.347]  Look, I'm not that smart.
[01:12:22.418 --> 01:12:24.179]  I don't have that high of view of myself.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:24.920]  I really don't!
[01:12:27.601 --> 01:12:30.203]  I'm amazed by the skilled craftsmen I know.
[01:12:30.483 --> 01:12:31.844]  These incredible carpenters.
[01:12:31.924 --> 01:12:35.266]  I'm amazed by farmers and ranchers I know and the skills they know.
[01:12:35.286 --> 01:12:36.907]  I'm amazed by doctor skills.
[01:12:36.967 --> 01:12:39.329]  I'm amazed by chiropractor skills.
[01:12:39.369 --> 01:12:41.450]  I'm amazed by school teachers.
[01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:46.994]  And I'm amazed by artisans and filmmakers and musicians I know.
[01:12:47.494 --> 01:12:49.075]  I don't have that high of view of myself.
[01:12:49.155 --> 01:12:51.657]  I can't play a harmonica, much less a violin.
[01:12:53.138 --> 01:12:56.681]  I don't know how to build a barn in two days.
[01:12:56.981 --> 01:12:58.182]  I don't know how to do a lot of things.
[01:13:00.144 --> 01:13:02.906]  I don't know all the football and baseball scores either.
[01:13:02.966 --> 01:13:04.687]  You see, you're not dumb out there.
[01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:05.708]  You've been diverted.
[01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:14.019]  You're experts on how to act cool, how to have a bunch of friends, how to have all the leisure you can, how to max out your credit cards.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.642]  You're an expert on how to go play pool every night and get drunk.
[01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:23.345]  You're an expert on how to have the best cosmetics and sleep with the most men, if you're one of the women out there.
[01:13:23.706 --> 01:13:28.449]  You're an expert on all this stuff, but you don't know anything about the world.
[01:13:30.743 --> 01:13:32.724]  Do you know about the sun's history?
[01:13:32.744 --> 01:13:34.065]  Do you know about the planets?
[01:13:34.545 --> 01:13:35.925]  Do you know the order of the planets?
[01:13:35.965 --> 01:13:38.566]  Do you know just basic stuff?
[01:13:39.207 --> 01:13:40.888]  Do you know who invented the light bulb?
[01:13:41.368 --> 01:13:44.709]  Do you know who invented electricity or who captured it first?
[01:13:45.369 --> 01:13:46.670]  It was one of our founding fathers.
[01:13:48.751 --> 01:13:50.752]  I mean, do you know who our founding fathers were?
[01:13:50.772 --> 01:13:53.153]  Do you know what the first ten amendments to the Bill of Rights are?
[01:13:53.193 --> 01:13:54.093]  Well, I got rights.
[01:13:54.153 --> 01:13:55.434]  My rights ain't been taken.
[01:13:57.495 --> 01:13:59.317]  Well, they're being taken, they're being dismantled.
[01:13:59.337 --> 01:14:00.298]  Do you know your rights?
[01:14:00.378 --> 01:14:01.199]  No, you don't know them.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.724]  So I'm not some arrogant person up here pontificating.
[01:14:05.844 --> 01:14:06.525]  I'm scared.
[01:14:07.326 --> 01:14:08.447]  I'm really freaked out.
[01:14:09.548 --> 01:14:16.055]  Because we have a government engaging in every telltale sign, every key indicator, every signature, every wavelength.
[01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:22.518]  All the modus operandi, the classic MO of really scary tyrants.
[01:14:22.598 --> 01:14:27.402]  I don't mean the type of tyrant that's just a dictator and steals from people and is a little bit corrupt.
[01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.285]  I mean, I'm talking about mechanized extermination.
[01:14:30.325 --> 01:14:32.607]  I'm talking about real slave pit type stuff.
[01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.069]  I'm talking about the worst stuff in history we've seen.
[01:14:35.329 --> 01:14:40.513]  The exact same thing manifesting with a high-tech overlay grid merged with it.
[01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.656]  And I see the general public, man, they're in la-la land.
[01:14:44.216 --> 01:14:49.778]  Driving around smiling, listening to the rock and roll music, or going to their church.
[01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.499]  You know, the Lord's coming soon.
[01:14:51.559 --> 01:14:54.220]  Thank God they're trying to microchip us.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.701]  Thank God all these Latin American presidents are trying to make their people take them.
[01:14:58.401 --> 01:15:00.182]  Oh, I'm glad things are getting bad.
[01:15:00.222 --> 01:15:01.862]  It means I'll be out of here soon.
[01:15:02.983 --> 01:15:06.344]  You're not a real Christian, folks, if you don't have a burning desire to warn other people.
[01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.231]  You don't have a burning desire to try to fight this evil.
[01:15:09.651 --> 01:15:11.773]  I mean, your discernment's gone.
[01:15:11.833 --> 01:15:12.313]  You're gone.
[01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:13.814]  You're not going where you think you're going.
[01:15:14.115 --> 01:15:15.215]  That freaks me out.
[01:15:16.877 --> 01:15:17.957]  That scares me.
[01:15:18.478 --> 01:15:22.861]  It's just... Neocon talk radio.
[01:15:24.823 --> 01:15:26.364]  Fake conservative talk radio.
[01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:40.508]  Covers up for all the Bush's spending, and his gun control, and his doubling the size of every major federal agency, and all the horrors, and doubling the money for Health and Human Services, and the CPS, and just everything evil he's doing.
[01:15:40.548 --> 01:15:41.688]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:44.549]  It's all off the Richter scale.
[01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:45.930]  I'm shocked.
[01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:47.150]  I'm taken aback.
[01:15:47.851 --> 01:15:50.712]  I mean, I can't believe how they're just doing it all out in the open.
[01:15:50.992 --> 01:15:52.592]  Yeah, the NSA's spying on you.
[01:15:52.912 --> 01:15:56.834]  Fourth Amendment says we're allowed to spy without warrants, when it says the exact opposite.
[01:15:57.594 --> 01:16:00.056]  Well, people don't know how many continents there are.
[01:16:00.076 --> 01:16:05.780]  They're certainly not going to know what the first ten amendments are, and they're not going to know what the fourth amendment is.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.402]  Or they think they know because the TV tells them.
[01:16:08.842 --> 01:16:11.664]  The fourth amendment means you have the right to be spied on for your safety.
[01:16:12.064 --> 01:16:12.785]  That's what they're saying.
[01:16:13.065 --> 01:16:15.887]  Oh, I have my right to be spied on, Mr. Jones!
[01:16:16.087 --> 01:16:16.828]  Shut up!
[01:16:21.059 --> 01:16:32.906]  I mean, I read these articles in the Financial Papers, Wall Street Journal today, everybody's celebrating, oh, the Dow's broken the record, oh, 11,600 and something, it's back, the economy's back, oh.
[01:16:33.766 --> 01:16:38.569]  No, in mid-2000, the economy crashed, we had a deep recession.
[01:16:40.174 --> 01:16:48.020]  We would have had a depression, which would have been milder compared to what it's going to be, but like a heroin addict who gets addicted, they just took even more instead of going through withdrawals.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.123]  And the Federal Reserve doubled the money in the next five to six years.
[01:16:53.423 --> 01:16:53.844]  Doubled it.
[01:16:54.284 --> 01:16:57.046]  Now Bernanke's in there, he's saying he's going to double that in two.
[01:16:58.527 --> 01:16:59.748]  The dollar's imploding.
[01:17:00.268 --> 01:17:01.889]  And of course the stock market's at $11,000.
[01:17:05.217 --> 01:17:06.499]  Of course it is!
[01:17:08.723 --> 01:17:12.970]  If you've doubled the money supply, that means the stock market's at 6,000-something.
[01:17:13.891 --> 01:17:17.578]  I know I keep saying that, but I mean, come on, people!
[01:17:18.604 --> 01:17:19.065]  Okay?
[01:17:19.325 --> 01:17:21.226]  You don't know how many continents there are.
[01:17:21.587 --> 01:17:22.627]  Basic stuff like that.
[01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:24.269]  You don't know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:26.310]  You don't know what the Tenth Amendment is.
[01:17:26.651 --> 01:17:28.492]  You don't even know what the whole First Amendment is.
[01:17:28.892 --> 01:17:29.953]  Most people think they do.
[01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:36.278]  And I'm talking about the general public listening, not our long-time listeners who are smarter than I am, or more informed on this issue than I am.
[01:17:36.639 --> 01:17:44.245]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks, when you don't even know the dollars tanked, and you don't even know they're printing money like Germany was before the crash.
[01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:48.513]  I mean, I'm upset about this, and it's going to be painful.
[01:17:49.154 --> 01:17:51.897]  There's going to be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.
[01:17:52.597 --> 01:17:56.762]  You're going to be so freaked out, and you're going to go right to the very government that's going to engineer it all.
[01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:58.664]  They're going to have make-work programs.
[01:17:58.684 --> 01:18:01.748]  It's going to be tattletale squads, set of building dams, and...
[01:18:04.378 --> 01:18:08.239]  Government buildings, you're going to be building FEMA camps, and you're going to be tattling on neighbors.
[01:18:08.259 --> 01:18:09.179]  They've openly announced it.
[01:18:09.579 --> 01:18:20.961]  Our whole economy is going to shift into this hellish thing, and to do anything, you know, to make $20,000 a year when it's worth $10,000 a year, and to stomp around in some uniform, that's all you'll have is your dumb uniform, you're going to do it!
[01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:24.641]  You're going to help kill this country for the very people that did this to us!
[01:18:27.462 --> 01:18:33.463]  I mean, that's the sick thing about the New World Order, is they do it to you, and then you thank them while they do it as your savior.
[01:18:34.073 --> 01:18:37.278]  They blow up buildings right in front of you.
[01:18:37.298 --> 01:18:42.104]  They got declassified documents saying they carry out terror attacks.
[01:18:42.745 --> 01:18:48.273]  And it's like talking to a bunch of... Well, a bunch of ignorant savages are smarter than you.
[01:18:48.293 --> 01:18:51.057]  I mean, you people are as dumb as dirt!
[01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:56.953]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:57.293 --> 01:19:00.175]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.415 --> 01:19:06.599]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:19:06.979 --> 01:19:14.283]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:18.566]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:20:02.244 --> 01:20:05.525]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:05.565 --> 01:20:06.205]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:20:11.764 --> 01:20:12.945]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:13.485 --> 01:20:19.409]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[01:20:19.529 --> 01:20:22.732]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:23.492 --> 01:20:25.854]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:20:25.874 --> 01:20:29.136]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.737 --> 01:20:32.779]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:20:49.547 --> 01:20:56.650]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.291 --> 01:21:03.053]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:10.792]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation chapter 13?
[01:21:12.305 --> 01:21:17.007]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[01:21:17.527 --> 01:21:22.949]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:32.353]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:33.053 --> 01:21:34.494]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:41.217 --> 01:21:47.801]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:48.942]  Call now.
[01:21:49.102 --> 01:21:51.763]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:54.088 --> 01:21:58.531]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:21:58.811 --> 01:22:02.394]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:22:02.534 --> 01:22:10.680]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:16.544]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:22:16.844 --> 01:22:22.087]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:22:22.347 --> 01:22:24.449]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:36.856]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:22:37.076 --> 01:22:41.500]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:22:41.721 --> 01:22:42.681]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:22:42.862 --> 01:22:44.483]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:22:44.623 --> 01:22:46.405]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:22:46.665 --> 01:22:47.126]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:22:47.186 --> 01:22:47.366]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:22:58.218 --> 01:23:02.581]  Let's move quick.
[01:23:02.802 --> 01:23:05.003]  Keith in New Jersey.
[01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:05.924]  You're on the air.
[01:23:05.964 --> 01:23:06.684]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:23:07.005 --> 01:23:08.205]  Yo, hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:23:08.606 --> 01:23:11.628]  Yo, um, I realized you were talking about you were making a new film.
[01:23:11.648 --> 01:23:12.929]  You don't even have a title for it.
[01:23:13.429 --> 01:23:14.530]  I have a couple suggestions.
[01:23:15.171 --> 01:23:22.016]  The first one is government, government, the ultimate inside job, or just inside jobs of the government.
[01:23:23.076 --> 01:23:24.978]  Inside jobs of the government?
[01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:25.298]  Yes.
[01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:30.194]  Or terrorism, an inside job, something like that.
[01:23:30.434 --> 01:23:31.115]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:23:32.096 --> 01:23:47.691]  Another quick point, if you have enough time, is believe it or not, the hip-hop community, at least the underground parts of it, are actually aware and awake to this 9-11 and inside jobs, and the CIA being responsible for distributing drugs in America.
[01:23:48.172 --> 01:23:50.454]  I know you were talking about the prison industrial complex,
[01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:56.886]  No, I know a lot of the underground hip-hop, the stuff that doesn't get played on stations or picked up by MTV, that's some of the best out there.
[01:23:56.906 --> 01:24:06.035]  I mean, I can't listen to the mainstream hip-hop, but you listen to a lot of the alternative, Parrish and others, Immortal Technique, and it's all about 9-11 being an inside job, you name it.
[01:24:06.735 --> 01:24:08.297]  Remo Conscience, to name a few ones.
[01:24:08.937 --> 01:24:13.601]  And actually, one of them, who's mainstream, actually spoke about this in a quick blurb.
[01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.423]  I don't know if you ever heard of Jadakiss from The Rocks?
[01:24:16.263 --> 01:24:18.365]  He actually had a song out there that was pretty popular.
[01:24:18.385 --> 01:24:18.965]  It was called Lie.
[01:24:18.985 --> 01:24:20.206]  Yeah, Bush brought down the towers.
[01:24:20.286 --> 01:24:20.887]  That's the one.
[01:24:21.247 --> 01:24:30.114]  And then there's also, if you look at some of the music that Eminem's put out, he also did a music video with Guerrilla News Network.
[01:24:31.014 --> 01:24:35.798]  Oh, you're talking about the one that got censored and they changed the ending to vote instead of Bush being impeached?
[01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:36.419]  Yes.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:43.924]  Oh, another thing is I'm a longtime listener and I've been trying to do my part on MySpace, on Facebook.
[01:24:44.184 --> 01:24:46.126]  I've actually started up the night
[01:24:46.545 --> 01:24:48.466]  9-11 Truth Movement on Facebook.
[01:24:49.047 --> 01:25:00.735]  All you gotta do is go to NJIT and just do a search on 9-11 Truth Movement and actually I also put up a post on where you can view Loose Change First and Second Edition on video.google.com.
[01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.989]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:03.090 --> 01:25:04.190]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:05.772]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:05.832 --> 01:25:08.574]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:25:08.934 --> 01:25:11.376]  Let's talk to Travis in Ohio.
[01:25:11.457 --> 01:25:11.797]  Welcome.
[01:25:12.297 --> 01:25:13.258]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:13.338 --> 01:25:14.699]  I'm a huge fan.
[01:25:14.939 --> 01:25:16.421]  It's a real honor to actually talk to you.
[01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:17.241]  Honored to talk to you.
[01:25:17.281 --> 01:25:17.842]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:22.206]  Well, sir, actually, I want to say I'm in Kentucky, but I'm right across the river.
[01:25:22.306 --> 01:25:29.772]  But yeah, George Bush will be speaking up here at Northern Kentucky University on the 19th of this month.
[01:25:30.383 --> 01:25:33.665]  I just wanted to try to get the word out for anybody in this area who doesn't know about it.
[01:25:34.165 --> 01:25:46.951]  There will be a few protests, not many though, and most of the people that I've talked to through the campus organizations, all the Democrats are like, no we don't want any crazy people up here talking crazy stuff and all that sort of crap.
[01:25:47.812 --> 01:25:48.512]  Just try to keep it
[01:25:49.258 --> 01:25:50.738]  On the issues, as they would say.
[01:25:50.918 --> 01:25:59.360]  Yeah, the left gatekeepers who work for Hillary Clinton and others, trying to minimize and control any movement against Lord Bush, who's their boss.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.001]  I've been arguing about Hillary for the past year, that this is who's going to be coming.
[01:26:05.021 --> 01:26:09.181]  Everybody's like, well, she'll do alright, she'll be good, she'll be alright, she'll be good.
[01:26:09.922 --> 01:26:12.162]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:12.402 --> 01:26:13.122]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:13.182 --> 01:26:18.023]  She's even more pro-war than George Bush, and the neocons now are starting to love her.
[01:26:18.928 --> 01:26:19.428]  That's right.
[01:26:20.348 --> 01:26:21.669]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.849]  Let's talk to Phil in Maryland.
[01:26:23.869 --> 01:26:24.529]  You're on the air.
[01:26:25.069 --> 01:26:27.050]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:27.090 --> 01:26:28.830]  You bet.
[01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:34.231]  Through doing research on the internet, something unrelated woke up to all this.
[01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:40.832]  It's been less than a year, actually, and I have been just a voracious reader of trying to inform myself.
[01:26:41.733 --> 01:26:43.713]  Well, that's a sure sign of being with Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:45.124 --> 01:26:45.684]  Yeah, right.
[01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:59.769]  I have in-laws in Houston, and I just, you know, sent them the scanned images of the Texas, whatever it is, if you wear Levi jeans, and they're slowly waking up.
[01:26:59.869 --> 01:27:05.110]  Oh yeah, the terror handbook saying that if you're a land rights activist or wear Levi's, you're a terrorist.
[01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:09.931]  Listen, my brother is a general aviation pilot, and back in 2000 and 2002,
[01:27:12.409 --> 01:27:18.093]  We fly, you know, down to Florida to go fishing or something, and I turn my cell phone on and it's playing.
[01:27:18.133 --> 01:27:22.316]  We were at about, you know, in a general aviation Cessna, you can't go above, say, 8.
[01:27:22.816 --> 01:27:26.939]  And if you don't have a compressed cabin above 10,000, you're supposed to be on oxygen.
[01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:33.223]  So even at, say, I think we were like maybe 5,500 feet, you know, to get some smooth air.
[01:27:34.043 --> 01:27:36.225]  And pilots are knowledgeable about
[01:27:37.066 --> 01:27:42.988]  uh... FM frequencies, AM frequencies, they fly to a radio beacon at night with visual flow.
[01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:44.348]  I understand, yes.
[01:27:44.448 --> 01:27:57.792]  So these commercial pilots, they understand that cell phones don't work in a steel tube at 30,000 feet and I was talking to my brother who's a little skeptical about this and I said, let's just say his name is Joe and our last name is Smith.
[01:27:57.872 --> 01:28:05.554]  I said to my brother Joe, I said, Joe when's the last time you called mom and said, hi mom this is Joe Smith, using your last name.
[01:28:06.724 --> 01:28:08.085]  Which is, which is what is going on.
[01:28:08.125 --> 01:28:08.926]  Oh yeah, the calls.
[01:28:09.466 --> 01:28:11.748]  Hello, this is Joe Smith, your son.
[01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:12.949]  The terrorists have me.
[01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.629]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:13.649 --> 01:28:15.530]  And I'm calling from 30,000 feet.
[01:28:15.951 --> 01:28:16.191]  Yeah.
[01:28:16.551 --> 01:28:17.852]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:28:17.912 --> 01:28:18.593]  You know, come on.
[01:28:18.933 --> 01:28:23.296]  Now, Alex, last night ABC aired the bird flu movie and I watched most of it.
[01:28:23.876 --> 01:28:25.978]  But you didn't bring that up for this.
[01:28:25.998 --> 01:28:26.538]  Well, stay there.
[01:28:26.598 --> 01:28:27.279]  I didn't see it.
[01:28:27.359 --> 01:28:29.721]  So give us your take on it real quick.
[01:28:29.741 --> 01:28:32.803]  Then we'll go right to Aaron Zellman, JPFO director.
[01:28:33.453 --> 01:28:35.094]  With the update on the Second Amendment.
[01:28:35.114 --> 01:28:36.234]  Because we're evil liberals.
[01:28:36.275 --> 01:28:37.635]  We're pro-gun, anti-hillary.
[01:28:38.055 --> 01:28:38.756]  You gotta get ready.
[01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:39.956]  We're now the liberals.
[01:28:43.838 --> 01:28:44.739]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.239 --> 01:28:46.820]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.442]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.599 --> 01:28:59.902]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.263 --> 01:29:04.965]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[01:29:05.285 --> 01:29:12.909]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:20.073]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.293 --> 01:29:21.674]  There are no side effects!
[01:29:22.014 --> 01:29:25.636]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[01:29:49.326 --> 01:29:53.089]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.529 --> 01:29:55.510]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:29:55.590 --> 01:30:06.277]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.677 --> 01:30:11.203]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[01:30:11.263 --> 01:30:22.618]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.198 --> 01:30:30.044]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.444 --> 01:30:32.566]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.067 --> 01:30:38.031]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.331 --> 01:30:44.640]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.906]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:30:49.967 --> 01:30:50.007]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:55.373]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:55.574 --> 01:31:00.758]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[01:31:01.098 --> 01:31:02.579]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:02.679 --> 01:31:04.661]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:04.941 --> 01:31:10.465]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:10.745 --> 01:31:17.010]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:17.331 --> 01:31:19.552]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:19.853 --> 01:31:22.715]  And get this, they guaranteed my success in writing.
[01:31:23.215 --> 01:31:26.677]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:31:26.897 --> 01:31:27.298]  Whoa!
[01:31:27.698 --> 01:31:28.899]  What was that website again?
[01:31:28.979 --> 01:31:32.461]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:33.881]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:38.324]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:38.464 --> 01:31:39.044]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:39.325 --> 01:31:40.525]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:40.926 --> 01:31:41.566]  Check, please!
[01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:44.812]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:45.893]  Sure, John.
[01:31:46.113 --> 01:31:50.476]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:50.777 --> 01:31:52.458]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:52.638 --> 01:31:52.979]  Deal?
[01:31:53.999 --> 01:31:59.644]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:01.206 --> 01:32:07.551]  We'll be joined here in just a minute or two by Aaron Zellman, Director of Jewish Preservation Firearms Ownership.
[01:32:08.542 --> 01:32:12.508]  One of the best Second Amendment organizations in this country gives us the real intelligence we need.
[01:32:12.928 --> 01:32:19.036]  We also carry a documentary film that they produced, Innocence Betrayed, that is the best Second Amendment documentary I've seen bar none.
[01:32:19.057 --> 01:32:20.639]  It's about the hundreds of millions killed.
[01:32:21.585 --> 01:32:22.125]  We're good to go.
[01:32:41.468 --> 01:32:52.832]  Images of millions dead, dump trucks full of dead bodies, funeral pyres, and the directors of it said in the AP last week that, well, this is meant to get you ready for what will happen and how to respond.
[01:32:53.212 --> 01:33:02.135]  Simultaneously, Bush is announcing measures for martial law during a bird flu outbreak, and we know that in New Orleans they didn't bring food and water, they came to take the guns.
[01:33:02.839 --> 01:33:03.799]  So very, very serious.
[01:33:03.819 --> 01:33:06.260]  So that dovetails in with Aaron Zellman coming up in one moment.
[01:33:06.561 --> 01:33:08.861]  So you saw it last night, Phil, in Maryland.
[01:33:08.881 --> 01:33:09.482]  Tell us about it.
[01:33:10.102 --> 01:33:10.282]  Right.
[01:33:10.322 --> 01:33:11.643]  I didn't watch it end-to-end.
[01:33:11.763 --> 01:33:12.743]  I watched most of it.
[01:33:12.863 --> 01:33:19.546]  And Alex, I would just say, you know, it's another spoonful of desensitization of the population.
[01:33:20.186 --> 01:33:21.587]  Let me just give you one of the scenes.
[01:33:21.827 --> 01:33:22.547]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:33:23.587 --> 01:33:23.928]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:23.988 --> 01:33:24.348]  I can.
[01:33:25.348 --> 01:33:25.668]  Okay.
[01:33:26.068 --> 01:33:26.909]  One of the scenes there, Alex.
[01:33:28.886 --> 01:33:29.226]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:29.426 --> 01:33:29.707]  Yes.
[01:33:30.327 --> 01:33:31.448]  Tell us about one of the scenes.
[01:33:31.928 --> 01:33:45.636]  Okay, there's a woman laying on the couch and I don't know, you know, how severe this bird flu would be, but she's laying on the couch, apparently dead, and at the head of the couch, where she was apparently blown her nose, there's this pile of bloody Kleenexes.
[01:33:46.136 --> 01:33:49.718]  And then they're making it like there's all this blood coming out of her mouth.
[01:33:50.299 --> 01:33:54.021]  So, you know, we're led to believe that you're not just dying from
[01:33:54.642 --> 01:34:05.110]  You know, a severe form of the flu where your lungs become congested and you're not processing oxygen or whatever, but that you're actually going to be, you know... It's basically like Ebola.
[01:34:05.571 --> 01:34:05.971]  Yeah.
[01:34:06.011 --> 01:34:07.252]  Which it really isn't.
[01:34:07.612 --> 01:34:07.852]  Yes.
[01:34:07.932 --> 01:34:11.355]  I mean, what about the scenes of dump trucks and dead bodies?
[01:34:11.795 --> 01:34:12.336]  Absolutely.
[01:34:12.356 --> 01:34:13.196]  They have a dump truck.
[01:34:13.216 --> 01:34:18.340]  You know, one of the, the guy, the actor playing the mayor of Richmond,
[01:34:19.699 --> 01:34:20.280]  I don't know.
[01:34:36.135 --> 01:34:39.257]  You know, low-income African-American housing units.
[01:34:39.377 --> 01:34:40.517]  No, you can't come out.
[01:34:40.657 --> 01:34:41.758]  No, you can't go in.
[01:34:41.778 --> 01:34:49.522]  And of course, in the movie, it's always the disadvantaged group that the young yuppies will watch and think, oh, it's just for them.
[01:34:50.083 --> 01:34:50.783]  I'm safe.
[01:34:51.283 --> 01:34:55.185]  Guaranteed, folks, if there's a bird flu outbreak that they engineer, they're coming for your guns.
[01:34:55.205 --> 01:34:56.286]  They're not coming to help you.
[01:34:56.906 --> 01:34:57.346]  That's right.
[01:34:58.047 --> 01:35:01.068]  And it would be an engineered outbreak.
[01:35:01.449 --> 01:35:05.591]  I have relatives, Alex, I don't want to say who, very close to me, that work for
[01:35:06.472 --> 01:35:07.353]  Uh, they're drug reps.
[01:35:07.913 --> 01:35:11.674]  And they work for the company that produces Tamiflu.
[01:35:12.375 --> 01:35:14.055]  So, I know a little bit... That's Gilead.
[01:35:14.736 --> 01:35:15.096]  What's that?
[01:35:15.416 --> 01:35:15.876]  Gilead.
[01:35:16.737 --> 01:35:21.979]  Yeah, well, Gilead owns the patent for the manufacturing, but the company that actually reps it is a different name.
[01:35:22.039 --> 01:35:22.279]  Yes.
[01:35:22.539 --> 01:35:24.180]  It's, it's, it's, I don't want to say the name.
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.322]  But anyway, uh, I, I... The name is in public, but it doesn't matter.
[01:35:28.362 --> 01:35:28.742]  Go ahead.
[01:35:28.922 --> 01:35:29.742]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:35:29.842 --> 01:35:32.984]  Well, um, but anyway, it's not an American company.
[01:35:33.044 --> 01:35:34.684]  It's a, it's a, it's a... Fine, fine.
[01:35:34.705 --> 01:35:35.725]  Go ahead and finish up.
[01:35:36.408 --> 01:35:37.308]  No, that's all.
[01:35:37.328 --> 01:35:41.110]  I want to say something about Hillary Clinton and I think the false dialectic.
[01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:42.070]  I gotta go to my guest.
[01:35:42.331 --> 01:35:43.111]  I gotta go to my guest.
[01:35:43.631 --> 01:35:44.231]  I appreciate your call.
[01:35:44.251 --> 01:35:44.972]  I'm not trying to be rude.
[01:35:44.992 --> 01:35:47.673]  I just held you over to get your view on the bird flow.
[01:35:47.753 --> 01:35:48.993]  I can't hold you over any longer.
[01:35:49.334 --> 01:35:51.234]  But call me back tomorrow if you want to talk about Hillary.
[01:35:51.274 --> 01:35:51.554]  Sorry.
[01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:53.515]  Aaron Zellman's been holding long enough.
[01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:55.476]  Mr. Zellman, good to have you on with us.
[01:35:56.056 --> 01:35:56.617]  Hello, Alex.
[01:35:56.697 --> 01:35:57.157]  How are you?
[01:35:57.797 --> 01:35:58.137]  Good!
[01:35:58.157 --> 01:36:11.422]  Yeah, there's all sorts of made-for-TV movies that mirror what Bush is seeing in reality, and now a state rep up in Oklahoma has openly said that, how dare the state try to pass a law saying they won't confiscate guns during an emergency?
[01:36:11.442 --> 01:36:13.763]  Why, we should just turn our guns in if the police say so!
[01:36:15.584 --> 01:36:20.086]  Well, let me tell you how they're going to go about doing that.
[01:36:20.446 --> 01:36:22.007]  That's what we're talking about today.
[01:36:23.047 --> 01:36:25.548]  They have a new wrinkle that they want to work on.
[01:36:26.035 --> 01:36:28.637]  Well, if I could just make one comment about the Bird Flu movie.
[01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:33.660]  Now, the good news in the movie was that the National Guard was in a place called Iraq.
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:39.103]  So they didn't have a National Guard to help the police, and half the police decided not to come to work.
[01:36:40.264 --> 01:36:43.066]  So, there's always a silver lining in a cloud.
[01:36:43.166 --> 01:36:44.847]  Oh, that really happened in the Bird Flu movie?
[01:36:45.087 --> 01:36:45.347]  Yes.
[01:36:45.688 --> 01:36:47.449]  Did the foreign troops save us?
[01:36:47.509 --> 01:36:48.830]  Who saved us?
[01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:50.371]  No, they didn't bring foreign troops in.
[01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:52.332]  They were smart enough not to put that in the movie.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.662]  They'll just announce that when they decide to do it.
[01:36:56.022 --> 01:37:06.169]  But anyway... Well, before you get into the new stuff that's happening, it's very important, for those that just joined us, we're not joking that in New Orleans, they went in to confiscate guns in high and dry wealthy areas, even.
[01:37:07.069 --> 01:37:08.050]  Oh, sure they did, yeah.
[01:37:08.610 --> 01:37:10.512]  But let me explain what the new wrinkle's gonna be.
[01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:18.517]  We have a little program we call Talking to America, and we talked to a fellow by the name of Len Savage, who's a gun manufacturer.
[01:37:19.485 --> 01:37:33.270]  Who has been brutalized by the BATFE for questioning their activities, demanding the truth, and associating with a Jewish civil rights organization, JPFO.
[01:37:34.671 --> 01:37:38.592]  Well, in some of the letters that he's gotten, and we've now posted them on our site,
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:43.183]  The BATF has pretty much admitted the new angle they're going to use.
[01:37:43.343 --> 01:37:45.065]  In fact, I have the letters from the U.S.
[01:37:45.085 --> 01:37:48.948]  Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Gun Compensation.
[01:37:49.648 --> 01:37:52.250]  The Bureau of Gun Compensation admits what they're doing right here.
[01:37:53.011 --> 01:37:58.916]  Sure, what they're going to do, this is important for people to understand, they are reinterpreting the regulations.
[01:37:59.952 --> 01:38:02.193]  That way they don't have to ask for a new law.
[01:38:02.233 --> 01:38:02.933]  Now let me stop you.
[01:38:03.054 --> 01:38:11.778]  I had Bob Barr on three months ago on the NRA board and he said George Bush is more of an anti-gun than Bill Clinton and he said that's what they're doing.
[01:38:11.818 --> 01:38:17.901]  They're reinterpreting old laws claiming now they can go out and grab our quote assault weapons.
[01:38:17.961 --> 01:38:19.261]  Please tell us all about it.
[01:38:20.582 --> 01:38:27.465]  Well Bob Barr is right because what they're doing if you look at the letters those letters are on our site for people to download JPFO.org
[01:38:29.264 --> 01:38:31.687]  But they're using two key words now.
[01:38:32.968 --> 01:38:36.852]  They are using the words characteristics and features.
[01:38:38.433 --> 01:38:42.698]  And if they decide that a weapon has the characteristics and features of a machine gun,
[01:38:44.275 --> 01:38:46.356]  Then they are going to call out a machine gun.
[01:38:46.616 --> 01:38:55.018]  Now for those that don't know, this makes the semi-automatic AK you've got, this makes the Ruger range rifle you've got in the gun case.
[01:38:55.718 --> 01:39:01.640]  All of this could be illegal according to them and they've actually been out arresting people for this.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:08.542]  And understand, Bush doubled the size of the BATF because he's so good and so conservative when he's not having fundraisers with Rupert Murdoch for Hillary Clinton.
[01:39:09.383 --> 01:39:16.730]  And now the BATF, even according to Bob Barr, is viciously attacking gun owners without even having a law.
[01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:20.214]  So we beat the assault weapons ban, and Bush doesn't give up, does he?
[01:39:20.975 --> 01:39:23.558]  Well, it appears that that's what's going on.
[01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:29.684]  They have an agenda, and the agenda is not to preserve gun ownership, but to destroy gun ownership.
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:38.346]  And now Bush says he's the decider, so he's allowed to torture without a law, he's allowed to sign bills that don't pass, he says he's allowed to lie about intelligence.
[01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:43.329]  He is above the law now, so I guess if he's the decider, he decides that we get to turn our guns in, Aaron.
[01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:50.294]  Well, maybe we want to talk just a moment about why this agenda is taking place.
[01:39:50.615 --> 01:39:51.976]  Sure, sure, let's get into it.
[01:39:52.016 --> 01:39:59.081]  I think there's a number of currents within America and society that people need to think seriously about.
[01:39:59.221 --> 01:39:59.481]  One is
[01:40:00.818 --> 01:40:08.985]  I think that the economy could be pretty faulty, and sooner or later the wheels are going to come off the trolley, to quote one writer.
[01:40:10.827 --> 01:40:21.415]  The other aspect, I think, is that there's just a growing friction between American citizens and those people that are here that are not legal citizens.
[01:40:22.236 --> 01:40:24.598]  I think that this friction is growing and growing.
[01:40:25.234 --> 01:40:28.557]  At some point we'll perhaps approach the exploding point.
[01:40:28.677 --> 01:40:29.578]  Everyone's saying that.
[01:40:29.598 --> 01:40:32.300]  We're going to have illegal aliens burn down every major U.S.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.362]  city, and anyone that tries to defend their property will be called a terrorist.
[01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:43.769]  Well, I haven't heard that, but I think that people need to understand that there's something very... that there's a couple of sad situations going on.
[01:40:44.650 --> 01:40:51.015]  I suppose the other possibility is going to be the, you know, if there is a terrorist activity,
[01:40:51.713 --> 01:40:51.953]  I think so.
[01:41:11.323 --> 01:41:12.804]  Truly scared to death of it.
[01:41:13.044 --> 01:41:15.905]  Well, won't that trigger another Lexington or Concord?
[01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:18.746]  We know New Orleans was a beta test and they failed miserably there.
[01:41:19.286 --> 01:41:23.448]  I mean, there's a lot of people when they come to quote, take the guns, that it's not going to be a pretty sight.
[01:41:25.049 --> 01:41:25.989]  Well, I think you're right.
[01:41:26.009 --> 01:41:29.730]  It will not be a pretty sight, but I'm, you know, and again, I don't know what's going to cause it.
[01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:33.392]  Uh, cause there's a number of different possibilities, but, um,
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:41.025]  Basically, we're in a gunpowder magazine and the feds are dancing around with blowtorches.
[01:41:42.146 --> 01:41:46.489]  Well, I tell you what, Alex, I think there's a real major issue that we have to confront people with.
[01:41:46.509 --> 01:41:52.974]  I think everybody listening has to ask themselves a very blunt question.
[01:41:53.094 --> 01:41:55.075]  Stand in the mirror and ask themselves a question.
[01:41:55.716 --> 01:41:59.018]  Do they fear the government more than they do God?
[01:41:59.038 --> 01:42:03.922]  And if they say yes to the government, then they are slaves, they're finished.
[01:42:04.366 --> 01:42:05.707]  There's no need for them to own a gun.
[01:42:05.727 --> 01:42:06.388]  Just turn it in.
[01:42:07.429 --> 01:42:12.073]  We have a problem in America today where people fear government more than the Almighty.
[01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:21.361]  And if that isn't addressed very quickly by Americans, or all people, then this country is doomed.
[01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:21.941]  It's finished.
[01:42:24.363 --> 01:42:27.546]  And so I think that people need to start thinking about these issues.
[01:42:27.566 --> 01:42:28.307]  These are real
[01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:30.710]  These are very serious times.
[01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:38.596]  Well, I mean, I've got anti-terror training manuals from all over the country saying gun enthusiasts are terrorists, land rights activists are terrorists.
[01:42:38.916 --> 01:42:45.962]  Let's get into these letters from the BATF, this new power they're announcing without laws, just the executive says we can.
[01:42:47.163 --> 01:42:50.146]  Well, what they're doing is simply reinterpreting the regulation.
[01:42:50.586 --> 01:42:52.488]  And so now they're going to start judging.
[01:42:53.369 --> 01:42:56.131]  The reason, I'll tell you, I think what brought this about
[01:42:56.943 --> 01:43:06.410]  Is that, as you know, JPFO has been actively involved in exposing the criminality of the ATF, especially in their testing procedures.
[01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:08.812]  They have no written procedure.
[01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:18.598]  When they're testing a firearm or when they're manufacturing evidence to use against somebody, they just sort of go along and do whatever they want to do.
[01:43:18.638 --> 01:43:20.039]  They make it up as they go along.
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:24.903]  When they go into court in their three-piece suit, everybody thinks they're an expert.
[01:43:25.478 --> 01:43:26.859]  And the jury doesn't know any better.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:29.981]  So we've exposed all of this.
[01:43:30.562 --> 01:43:33.104]  All of the treachery and all of the trickery.
[01:43:34.184 --> 01:43:37.106]  And they're no longer testing guns.
[01:43:37.167 --> 01:43:40.189]  Now they're just judging them on characteristics and features.
[01:43:40.469 --> 01:43:47.274]  In fact, you even got video of them at a range rigging a rifle to fire more than one shot per trigger pull.
[01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:48.895]  They were trying to do that.
[01:43:49.776 --> 01:43:52.818]  And the rifle was defective and so they were calling it a machine gun.
[01:43:53.733 --> 01:43:55.514]  When in reality, it's had a bad spring.
[01:43:56.294 --> 01:44:02.357]  And by the way, I've pulled a trigger before on an AR-15 or a MAC-90 and had it shoot two bullets.
[01:44:03.397 --> 01:44:04.498]  Well, that's not uncommon.
[01:44:05.178 --> 01:44:11.441]  I mean, that can happen depending upon, and often what it is, it's really a soft primer, the ammunition that you're using.
[01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:20.665]  Yeah, they'll go out there all day and shoot a thousand rounds, and if your gun does it one time, even after it's all heated up and they're sticking cheap Chinese ammo in it, you're going to prison!
[01:44:21.297 --> 01:44:22.437]  Well, that's what they want to do.
[01:44:22.457 --> 01:44:24.258]  So we've exposed all of this.
[01:44:25.118 --> 01:44:25.518]  The U.S.
[01:44:25.578 --> 01:44:34.261]  Justice Department truly hates Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership, because we've raised an issue they don't want the American public to think about.
[01:44:34.922 --> 01:44:38.663]  If there's no criteria in the past for testing firearms,
[01:44:39.292 --> 01:44:42.373]  How many innocent gun owners are now sitting in federal prison?
[01:44:42.493 --> 01:44:44.955]  And by the way, so you caught them with their pants down last year.
[01:44:45.015 --> 01:44:45.895]  We had you on about it.
[01:44:46.255 --> 01:44:53.859]  So, when they get caught breaking a law, they just regulatory claim they've changed the law or changed it to where they weren't breaking the law retroactively.
[01:44:54.219 --> 01:44:55.579]  Well, I think that's what they're up to.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:57.400]  Now, I've read the letters.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.901]  Why don't you break down the letters for folks?
[01:44:59.201 --> 01:45:05.804]  Well, first of all, I just want to make the point that I think that I'd rather be a thousand percent wrong on this, but I got a funny feeling I'm not.
[01:45:07.361 --> 01:45:08.542]  Not getting too technical.
[01:45:08.782 --> 01:45:10.003]  We're going to go through one letter.
[01:45:11.364 --> 01:45:15.667]  By the way, there's an interview on our website if people want to listen to what we're talking about.
[01:45:15.707 --> 01:45:16.167]  They can.
[01:45:17.988 --> 01:45:19.809]  But there's a fellow by the name of Len Savage.
[01:45:19.849 --> 01:45:21.130]  He's the manufacturer.
[01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:26.093]  And he submitted a device called the Baloo belt-fed device.
[01:45:26.994 --> 01:45:31.157]  It's an accessory that goes on top of certain types of firearms.
[01:45:31.937 --> 01:45:36.220]  It allows you to have a belt-fed system instead of a magazine-fed system.
[01:45:37.182 --> 01:45:40.684]  About nine months ago, the BATF said, well, this is a non-firearm.
[01:45:40.704 --> 01:45:42.085]  It's a non-gun.
[01:45:43.346 --> 01:45:44.827]  There's no need for us to deal with it.
[01:45:44.847 --> 01:45:46.188]  It's just an accessory.
[01:45:47.168 --> 01:45:50.050]  Nine months later, they come back and change their mind.
[01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:53.032]  And they say, well, we've changed our mind.
[01:45:53.712 --> 01:45:58.195]  We now look upon this device as a machine gun because of its characteristics and features.
[01:45:59.356 --> 01:46:06.040]  And if you add it to an existing machine gun, you've now created a new machine gun.
[01:46:06.873 --> 01:46:21.486]  So they take a semi-automatic rifle, you just put a different way of feeding bullets into it, still one shot, you know, one pull, one bullet out of each casing, and then they're now claiming anything that's a characteristic of a machine gun makes it a machine gun.
[01:46:21.526 --> 01:46:28.312]  Well, the body of many rifles that are semi-automatic are the bodies of machine guns.
[01:46:28.332 --> 01:46:29.953]  That makes millions of guns illegal.
[01:46:30.574 --> 01:46:32.035]  Well, I think that's where it's all going to go.
[01:46:33.231 --> 01:46:37.672]  I think it's a little more complex than the way you've put it, but that's fine considering we don't want to get into all the technicalities.
[01:46:38.292 --> 01:46:40.033]  But I think this is where it's going to go.
[01:46:40.773 --> 01:46:42.313]  Characteristics and features.
[01:46:42.473 --> 01:46:43.134]  Cosmetics.
[01:46:43.614 --> 01:46:44.974]  We've all heard about this before.
[01:46:46.174 --> 01:46:47.775]  And this is what they're doing now.
[01:46:48.315 --> 01:46:50.336]  Now there's another problem with all of this.
[01:46:51.276 --> 01:46:59.498]  If this agency, this rogue agency can get away with reinterpreting regulations, what's to stop other agencies?
[01:47:00.785 --> 01:47:01.525]  They're anti-American.
[01:47:01.545 --> 01:47:04.486]  But Aaron Zellman, you're very aware of what's happening politically.
[01:47:04.526 --> 01:47:06.707]  You have an organization against the police state as well.
[01:47:07.127 --> 01:47:21.392]  You know Bush has gone light years ahead of Clinton, who we never thought anyone could be any worse, saying he's the decider, and across the board reinterpreting everything, and saying he'll violate federal laws if he feels like it.
[01:47:22.292 --> 01:47:27.474]  Well, you know, all this has happened because a lot of Americans decide to go to sleep.
[01:47:28.416 --> 01:47:31.659]  They thought, well, you know, Bush is our guy and he's going to do what's best for us.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:36.483]  And now you look around the country and there's a whole lot of people who don't think that.
[01:47:36.903 --> 01:47:42.848]  How bad has it gotten when Bob Barr will come on here and say George Bush is worse than Bill Clinton?
[01:47:42.868 --> 01:47:44.029]  I mean, those are his words.
[01:47:44.089 --> 01:47:47.492]  I mean, for the NRA to be admitting that, that's amazing, Aaron.
[01:47:50.494 --> 01:47:51.175]  It is amazing.
[01:47:51.235 --> 01:47:52.476]  I was unaware that he did that.
[01:47:53.317 --> 01:47:54.217]  But he's right.
[01:47:54.277 --> 01:47:57.440]  In other words, the Bush administration has been no friend to gun owners.
[01:47:59.059 --> 01:48:07.412]  I've got to tell you something, people are going to think this is a little nuts, but a lot of gun owners were concerned about putting John Kerry in the White House and how horrible things were going to be.
[01:48:07.432 --> 01:48:12.681]  And I have to ask them the question, well, would they be more horrible today than they are?
[01:48:13.456 --> 01:48:17.038]  If millions of people would have been motivated to oppose everything he did?
[01:48:17.058 --> 01:48:17.958]  No, I agree.
[01:48:17.978 --> 01:48:20.159]  Could millions of people just going to sleep?
[01:48:20.299 --> 01:48:27.103]  Kerry would have been better, Gore would have been better because conservatives wouldn't have gone into a six year, eight year hibernation phase.
[01:48:27.403 --> 01:48:29.424]  Listen, I walked in the gun shop a few months ago.
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:31.680]  And I had two people that work at it.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.420]  It's a big shop.
[01:48:32.541 --> 01:48:34.761]  Confront me and say, quit lying about George Bush.
[01:48:35.101 --> 01:48:36.801]  He wasn't for the assault weapons ban.
[01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:39.602]  And then the manager came over and said, no, he's right.
[01:48:39.722 --> 01:48:40.702]  Alex is telling the truth.
[01:48:41.002 --> 01:48:42.023]  And I hadn't even brought it up.
[01:48:42.043 --> 01:48:43.263]  They were confronting me.
[01:48:43.903 --> 01:48:46.844]  They are living in a delusional world, Aaron.
[01:48:47.364 --> 01:48:51.805]  Well, now they're going to pay for their delusions and fantasies.
[01:48:51.905 --> 01:48:58.606]  As I tell my members who still have faith in Congress, these are your friends in Congress, not mine.
[01:49:00.131 --> 01:49:01.612]  And some people are beginning to listen.
[01:49:03.294 --> 01:49:04.795]  Well, they've got to decide what they love better.
[01:49:04.915 --> 01:49:07.317]  Bush, the phony conservative, or the Second Amendment?
[01:49:08.357 --> 01:49:09.999]  Well, it's going to boil down to that.
[01:49:10.059 --> 01:49:11.920]  And I think also the point that I've raised.
[01:49:12.721 --> 01:49:16.924]  That people need to... You know, we have an article on our site called Future World Citizen.
[01:49:17.925 --> 01:49:20.126]  And people have got to make a decision today.
[01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:24.730]  Either they fear the government more than God, or they fear God more than the government.
[01:49:25.268 --> 01:49:26.229]  Stay there, Aaron Zellman.
[01:49:26.329 --> 01:49:27.950]  Final segment, we'll plug the website.
[01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:29.491]  It's JPFO.org.
[01:49:29.531 --> 01:49:32.474]  We have links to it right now on the main page of InfoWars.com.
[01:49:33.314 --> 01:49:37.097]  They are a bulldog organization on the nose of the New World Order.
[01:49:37.618 --> 01:49:38.979]  We really appreciate Aaron Zellman.
[01:49:38.999 --> 01:49:44.403]  And by the way, I carry the unbelievably professional film they produced, Innocence Betrayed.
[01:49:44.443 --> 01:49:47.345]  It comes with three free booklets on the Second Amendment.
[01:49:47.365 --> 01:49:49.767]  When you get it, we have it in DVD and VHS.

[01:49:54.767 --> 01:49:57.609]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:59.451]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.791 --> 01:50:04.455]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.815 --> 01:50:11.561]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.881 --> 01:50:13.863]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.063 --> 01:50:16.906]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.987 --> 01:50:21.651]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.872 --> 01:50:26.276]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.516 --> 01:50:29.920]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:33.724]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.964 --> 01:50:36.407]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:54.031 --> 01:50:57.934]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:58.154 --> 01:51:03.599]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.859 --> 01:51:14.247]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.407 --> 01:51:18.751]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.851 --> 01:51:19.732]  We're good to go!
[01:51:47.853 --> 01:51:48.513]  I think so.
[01:52:10.663 --> 01:52:11.324]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.183 --> 01:52:43.285]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.445 --> 01:52:49.389]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:00.156 --> 01:53:03.078]  Brian, Bob and others, we'll take your call coming up in the next segment.
[01:53:03.098 --> 01:53:04.559]  We'll get to Darjah Mall after that.
[01:53:04.579 --> 01:53:05.880]  It's been in-country, in Iraq.
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:08.582]  We'll give you an eyewitness report on what's going on there.
[01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:15.602]  Going back to Aaron Zellman, I have had a couple run-ins with the BATF.
[01:53:15.682 --> 01:53:20.367]  One time I was at the gun show, and these guys radiated mafioso.
[01:53:20.447 --> 01:53:22.490]  I mean, they radiated weird, dangerous people.
[01:53:22.890 --> 01:53:24.652]  And you know the whole criminal demeanor.
[01:53:25.172 --> 01:53:26.874]  At least if you've been around in the world, you do.
[01:53:27.355 --> 01:53:29.357]  And they radiated criminality to me.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:37.443]  And then I've confronted him at a couple of public events, but imagine when you have two or three guys walk up to you, one guy in front of you, two guys at the same time behind you.
[01:53:37.723 --> 01:53:40.804]  Hey, we don't like how you call us the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco.
[01:53:41.144 --> 01:53:42.025]  We're ATF now.
[01:53:42.125 --> 01:53:43.665]  I'm like, hey man, you need to get out of my face.
[01:53:45.006 --> 01:53:47.086]  Aaron, have you ever had them do that to you?
[01:53:47.747 --> 01:53:48.647]  No, they haven't.
[01:53:48.687 --> 01:53:53.249]  Although I refer to them as the Bureau of Arbitrary Technical Findings and Edicts.
[01:53:55.209 --> 01:53:57.370]  They've never, well, they haven't done it to me recently.
[01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:58.471]  I can tell you a short story.
[01:54:00.258 --> 01:54:11.464]  Many years ago I was an expert witness at a trial in Georgia and Daniel's case where they ran shotgun news ads claiming the BATF were a bunch of Gestapo goons and name names.
[01:54:12.184 --> 01:54:12.905]  They got sued.
[01:54:14.265 --> 01:54:26.712]  The agents wanted a million dollars apiece for their damages and I went to the trial and I explained to people that they're just being Gestapo and SS and all that by just showing them Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:54:27.355 --> 01:54:37.544]  Make a long story short, the damages were dropped from a million dollars a piece to a thousand dollars, but two weeks later I had a knock at the door from BATF wanting to take a look at my books.
[01:54:37.564 --> 01:54:38.485]  I had an FFL.
[01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:43.469]  And they weren't real nasty, but it was pretty obvious what their intent was.
[01:54:44.592 --> 01:54:46.294]  We're here to intimidate you.
[01:54:46.414 --> 01:54:48.896]  Yeah, but I mean, I'm just walking along at the gun show.
[01:54:48.936 --> 01:54:50.017]  This has happened twice.
[01:54:50.057 --> 01:54:51.718]  They're like, hey, Mac, we don't like you.
[01:54:51.758 --> 01:54:53.220]  My friend doesn't like you either.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.501]  I mean, it's like something out of a movie.
[01:54:55.882 --> 01:55:01.967]  And of course, for those who don't know, they go back to the regulators who would go after people brewing moonshine for federal taxation.
[01:55:01.987 --> 01:55:06.330]  And they were known crooks then who would take payoffs or take your wife or take whatever.
[01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:08.692]  So they have a long history of being dirty.
[01:55:09.473 --> 01:55:10.554]  Well, they're political hacks.
[01:55:11.687 --> 01:55:14.428]  And I think people have to look at the organization for what it is.
[01:55:14.548 --> 01:55:18.769]  They're not people who are interested in obeying the Constitution of the United States.
[01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:21.530]  They're there to destroy gun ownership.
[01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:26.611]  Anybody who thinks differently, I would say that, in my opinion, you're engaging in a fantasy.
[01:55:26.651 --> 01:55:29.712]  Well, Aaron, where is all this going in the last minute we've got here together?
[01:55:29.752 --> 01:55:34.934]  Where is it going with their attack on the Second Amendment, trying to even expand the assault weapons ban by Fiat?
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:45.247]  Well, I think where it's going to go is that it won't be too long before you have the United Nations voting to ban firearms throughout the world, civilian ownership.
[01:55:45.887 --> 01:55:50.451]  You'll have the United States making some clumsy excuse while they have to go along.
[01:55:51.552 --> 01:55:57.857]  You're going to have an effort to, if the gun has certain features and characteristics, you're going to have to abandon it.
[01:55:58.737 --> 01:56:03.461]  And all this is coming down, and I'm going to make a prediction, I wouldn't plan on elections.
[01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:06.212]  I just wouldn't plan on it.
[01:56:06.292 --> 01:56:12.776]  You know, you've only made a few predictions, they've all come true, and a lot of people I respect are saying they think there's going to be a dictatorship.
[01:56:14.077 --> 01:56:16.799]  Well... Aaron, you've never gone this far.
[01:56:16.859 --> 01:56:17.780]  Why are you saying this?
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.042]  Well, I'm just very concerned about the welfare of the country.
[01:56:21.102 --> 01:56:26.306]  I hope people would wake up and realize just how important it is to have gun ownership.
[01:56:26.326 --> 01:56:31.069]  I mean, the film you're carrying from us that shows the connection between gun control and genocide,
[01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:33.392]  People really have got to take a look at that, Alex.
[01:56:33.432 --> 01:56:35.215]  They should call you up and order a copy today.
[01:56:35.675 --> 01:56:37.017]  I'm going to give that number out right now.
[01:56:37.037 --> 01:56:37.898]  Your phone number, give us that.
[01:56:40.547 --> 01:56:42.749]  It's 262-673-9745.
[01:56:42.909 --> 01:56:45.050]  Or JPFO.org.
[01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:46.511]  Aaron Zellman, thanks for joining us.
[01:56:46.671 --> 01:56:47.232]  My pleasure.
[01:56:47.512 --> 01:56:48.132]  God bless you.

[01:57:06.884 --> 01:57:09.206]  The Globalists are going to try to bring in a full dictatorship.
[01:57:09.969 --> 01:57:12.050]  We may be able to stop them if we get the word out enough.
[01:57:12.110 --> 01:57:12.950]  Get Martial Law.

[01:57:43.784 --> 01:57:44.025]  Hello?
[01:57:50.050 --> 01:57:50.711]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.371 --> 01:57:52.452]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.133 --> 01:57:54.254]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.895 --> 01:57:55.715]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.456 --> 01:57:57.237]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.001 --> 01:58:01.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.183 --> 01:58:06.305]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.207 --> 01:58:13.388]  The Republic is in very perilous times.
[01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:24.734]  At every level our freedoms are being systematically assaulted, dismantled, incinerated, decimated, terminated, annihilated.
[01:58:26.011 --> 01:58:33.374]  Ground beneath the treads of one world government and the corrupt elite that sees humans as the cheapest commodity on the planet is trash.
[01:58:34.575 --> 01:58:41.237]  I'm going to jam a bunch of calls in right now, and Dar Jamal, who's been inside Iraq, will join us to get into the whole Iran-Iraq situation.
[01:58:42.258 --> 01:58:47.120]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Brian in New York.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.100]  Brian, go ahead.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.901]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:50.261 --> 01:58:50.521]  Good.
[01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:55.463]  Listen, I was reading here, we wrote Wilson.
[01:58:56.886 --> 01:58:59.888]  He was the ex-president, 28th president of the United States.
[01:59:00.308 --> 01:59:02.610]  Yes, he's the guy that tried to give us the League of Nations.
[01:59:03.191 --> 01:59:06.813]  Oh yeah, not only that, didn't the I.A.S.
[01:59:06.833 --> 01:59:07.674]  start with him too?
[01:59:08.314 --> 01:59:11.196]  A lot of bad things, yes, Federal Reserve, everything.
[01:59:11.236 --> 01:59:13.338]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, okay.
[01:59:13.778 --> 01:59:19.642]  The great monopoly in this country is the money monopoly.
[01:59:20.123 --> 01:59:23.105]  So long as there exists our own, right,
[01:59:24.798 --> 01:59:26.619]  Yeah, let me just paraphrase his quotes, sir.
[01:59:26.639 --> 01:59:28.320]  I don't know if we have a lot of time to read quotes here.
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:31.582]  He was their servant until his last six months in office.
[01:59:31.602 --> 01:59:33.764]  Then he woke up and he'd been manipulated by House.
[01:59:35.005 --> 01:59:35.585]  Oh, Colonel?
[01:59:36.125 --> 01:59:37.826]  Yes, out of Austin, Texas.
[01:59:38.367 --> 01:59:41.589]  And then he started giving speeches against the bankers and then they killed him.
[01:59:42.850 --> 01:59:48.213]  Isn't that like 1911, the court by Justice Brandeis, all this people's money?
[01:59:49.042 --> 01:59:51.384]  Well, they killed him on a train, I believe.
[01:59:51.404 --> 01:59:52.045]  What was it?
[01:59:52.365 --> 01:59:52.045]  1918?
[01:59:52.606 --> 01:59:53.146]  Yeah.
[01:59:53.206 --> 01:59:54.788]  Hey, listen to this one.
[01:59:54.988 --> 01:59:55.789]  You ever hear this word?
[01:59:56.049 --> 01:59:57.070]  Cock-a-long-um?
[01:59:58.211 --> 02:00:01.414]  C-O-C-K-A-L-O-R-U-M?
[02:00:01.614 --> 02:00:02.015]  I don't know.
[02:00:02.355 --> 02:00:03.796]  Yeah, it's a colloquialism.
[02:00:04.397 --> 02:00:06.199]  A self-important little man.
[02:00:06.519 --> 02:00:09.062]  I like to hear that be said more and more often.
[02:00:11.331 --> 02:00:11.891]  Think about it.
[02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:12.592]  I hear you.
[02:00:12.612 --> 02:00:13.412]  I appreciate the call.
[02:00:13.432 --> 02:00:14.913]  I'm going to jam in as many as possible.
[02:00:14.953 --> 02:00:15.413]  Thank you.
[02:00:15.813 --> 02:00:16.594]  Thank you, Brian.
[02:00:17.074 --> 02:00:18.354]  Bobby in California.
[02:00:18.394 --> 02:00:19.115]  You're on the air.
[02:00:19.135 --> 02:00:21.656]  Hello?
[02:00:22.196 --> 02:00:22.737]  Yes, Bobby.
[02:00:23.177 --> 02:00:24.718]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[02:00:24.778 --> 02:00:25.278]  Hi.
[02:00:25.318 --> 02:00:26.719]  I have a lot to say, so I'm going to go fast.
[02:00:27.039 --> 02:00:28.660]  First of all, thank you for everything you do.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:31.541]  And I'd like to thank Charlie Sheen for everything he's doing.
[02:00:32.141 --> 02:00:33.402]  And I can tell him to stay strong.
[02:00:33.702 --> 02:00:35.263]  And remember, it's like the Matrix.
[02:00:35.283 --> 02:00:37.684]  All you have to do is keep getting up and fighting the new world order.
[02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:42.471]  And all you thousands of celebrities out there listening right now, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:44.612]  Yeah, let's wait and see what happens to Charlie.
[02:00:45.172 --> 02:00:47.773]  Yeah, let's throw a tuna man in the shark tank and see what happens.
[02:00:48.613 --> 02:00:51.434]  And let's give all the sharks plenty of time to focus in on Charlie.
[02:00:51.774 --> 02:00:54.015]  What's it been, over a month now since Charlie spoke out?
[02:00:55.115 --> 02:00:56.596]  It's been almost two months.
[02:00:57.356 --> 02:00:57.876]  Oh, two months?
[02:00:58.056 --> 02:01:02.798]  Yeah, maybe they could wait and see if they try to kill Charlie and maybe say some kind words at his funeral.
[02:01:02.918 --> 02:01:07.439]  He went public on March 20th and they've already put him through a massive lying meat grinder.
[02:01:08.872 --> 02:01:11.654]  I mean, do you think you guys are going to be part of the New World Order?
[02:01:11.674 --> 02:01:18.099]  Because you may survive phases, but unless you're down with drinking blood and raising little children, you ain't New World Order material.
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:24.685]  And a lot of people, a lot of listeners, or whatever, might be scared because the agency is listening on the phone.
[02:01:25.085 --> 02:01:32.892]  We should start every phone conversation with Chicago Tribune, Dynacorp, Child Sex Slavery Rings.
[02:01:34.321 --> 02:01:37.944]  Are these people that are listening on the phone, are they down with child sex slavery?
[02:01:38.004 --> 02:01:39.645]  I mean, are you guys down with this?
[02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.707]  I mean, it's sickening.
[02:01:42.388 --> 02:01:42.968]  Oh, you're right.
[02:01:43.028 --> 02:01:44.529]  Chicago Tribune.
[02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:48.533]  Are you guys just going to sit by?
[02:01:48.653 --> 02:01:53.717]  I mean, you could at least call Alex and say, I'm not down with child sex slavery.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:00.462]  Well, I don't approve of Dynacorp, but, I mean, it's just sickening.
[02:02:00.762 --> 02:02:02.503]  No, I agree, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[02:02:03.103 --> 02:02:05.324]  It is normal to be upset by this.
[02:02:05.444 --> 02:02:11.207]  Yes, Chicago Tribune, BBC, Dynacorp, and Halliburton have lobbyists in D.C.
[02:02:11.768 --> 02:02:20.072]  lobbying for the Army to not enforce laws against Kellogg, Brown and Root, and other subsidiaries who are engaging in massive child kidnapping and child slavery.
[02:02:20.972 --> 02:02:25.135]  Mainstream news, and no one's going to stop them.
[02:02:25.195 --> 02:02:25.895]  It's going to continue.
[02:02:26.963 --> 02:02:29.025]  Oh, the government wouldn't carry out 9-11!
[02:02:30.666 --> 02:02:35.329]  They just admit that 1.2 million women and children are kidnapped out of Europe each year.
[02:02:36.930 --> 02:02:39.012]  1.2 million!
[02:02:40.473 --> 02:02:44.215]  Out of sight, out of mind, the government's good!
[02:02:46.517 --> 02:02:49.419]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:51.402]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.602 --> 02:02:57.350]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.610 --> 02:03:02.877]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.178 --> 02:03:04.800]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.322]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.482 --> 02:03:11.265]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.526 --> 02:03:16.150]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:19.012]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:03:19.312 --> 02:03:22.515]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:03:22.555 --> 02:03:24.377]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:03:24.857 --> 02:03:26.938]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:03:27.018 --> 02:03:31.301]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:31.381 --> 02:03:31.961]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:32.902 --> 02:03:38.565]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:03:38.665 --> 02:03:40.667]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:03:40.907 --> 02:03:42.408]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:42.588 --> 02:03:44.649]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:45.859 --> 02:03:47.460]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:51.723]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.843 --> 02:03:54.725]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.805 --> 02:04:01.529]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:04.711]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.911 --> 02:04:07.293]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.433 --> 02:04:12.056]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:12.056 --> 02:04:12.817]  We're good to go!
[02:04:36.596 --> 02:04:37.077]  808-803-4438.
[02:04:37.137 --> 02:04:37.578]  That's 808-803-4438.
[02:04:37.598 --> 02:04:38.981]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.313 --> 02:04:47.313]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[02:04:47.453 --> 02:04:47.813]  Thanks.
[02:04:48.073 --> 02:04:50.314]  Last summer I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[02:04:50.434 --> 02:04:52.454]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[02:04:52.574 --> 02:04:53.954]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[02:04:54.014 --> 02:04:55.855]  See, this one looks thick, that one's yellow.
[02:04:55.935 --> 02:04:57.795]  What you need is Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:57.915 --> 02:05:01.076]  Non-X clears out the build-up that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[02:05:01.316 --> 02:05:02.496]  It's called Keratin Debris.
[02:05:02.636 --> 02:05:03.896]  Just apply Non-X daily.
[02:05:03.976 --> 02:05:06.017]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[02:05:06.257 --> 02:05:07.057]  Just look at mine!
[02:05:07.217 --> 02:05:09.657]  The dietrist recommended Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:09.857 --> 02:05:14.718]  Now at Walgreens, Long's, Eckerd Pharmacy, Rite Aid, and Brooks Pharmacy in the foot care section.
[02:05:16.676 --> 02:05:17.676]  Looking for profits?
[02:05:17.756 --> 02:05:19.117]  Looking for safety and security?
[02:05:19.597 --> 02:05:22.317]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:05:22.718 --> 02:05:29.959]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[02:05:30.359 --> 02:05:33.840]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:35.621]  Secure your position today.
[02:05:35.921 --> 02:05:37.121]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:37.201 --> 02:05:37.421]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:45.884 --> 02:05:48.105]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.666 --> 02:05:51.527]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:59.811]  We'll get into more of the international news, more of the national news.
[02:05:59.911 --> 02:06:01.932]  Your phone calls in this third hour.
[02:06:01.952 --> 02:06:02.913]  We've got 51 minutes left.
[02:06:03.293 --> 02:06:04.834]  Total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:08.493 --> 02:06:12.478]  Dar Jamal came into town over the weekend and gave a speech here at the University of Texas.
[02:06:13.118 --> 02:06:15.061]  And of course we've had Dar on several times.
[02:06:15.121 --> 02:06:22.209]  He is a journalist who has spent quite a bit of time in the Middle East and in Iraq, including in areas like Fallujah.
[02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:27.775]  And we like to have him on every few months to give us an update from his context in and outside
[02:06:28.741 --> 02:06:31.923]  of Iraq with those contacts about what's really going on there.
[02:06:31.963 --> 02:06:34.905]  I also wanted to get his view concerning Iran.
[02:06:34.925 --> 02:06:37.266]  Dar Jamal, it's always good to have you on with us.
[02:06:38.046 --> 02:06:38.847]  Thanks for having me Alex.
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:48.988]  Since the last caller brought up the Chicago Tribune and DynCorp and Halliburton white slavery rings in Europe and the Middle East, this is mainstream news and not debated.
[02:06:49.269 --> 02:06:51.351]  They have open lobbyists in D.C.
[02:06:51.431 --> 02:06:57.276]  lobbying the federal government not to enforce federal laws against Halliburton and DynCorp.
[02:06:57.556 --> 02:07:00.218]  I wanted to get your take on John Yoo a few months ago.
[02:07:00.259 --> 02:07:01.620]  We can't let this slip by us.
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:14.186]  In a CFR debate in Chicago, and it was recorded, we played it here several times, saying that yes, he wrote memos that they torture children in front of their parents, and yes, sexually, and that that's okay.
[02:07:14.566 --> 02:07:21.490]  Out of the gate, to illustrate the barbarity of these inhuman creatures, I wanted to see if you were aware of all that and get your take on it.
[02:07:22.564 --> 02:07:40.654]  I am, because particularly regarding Iraq, this is actually something that has been out in the open for quite some time now, that Halliburton is trafficking people, DynCorp is trafficking people in Iraq, sex slaves as well as, of course, just slave labor that they're using to run their operations there.
[02:07:40.674 --> 02:07:42.334]  So, on U.S.
[02:07:42.394 --> 02:07:48.958]  bases as well as other parts around Iraq, anywhere where KVR is involved, this sort of thing is going on.
[02:07:49.698 --> 02:07:54.082]  By the way, folks, that is not our opinion.
[02:07:54.102 --> 02:08:04.291]  I want the magnitude to sink in that from Eastern Europe to Central Europe to Central Asia, this is just going on right out in the open.
[02:08:04.311 --> 02:08:10.997]  They'll grab whole villages, the men go to brick factories, the women get sold into sex slavery or to textile mills worldwide.
[02:08:11.477 --> 02:08:19.382]  I mean this is pure evil like the bad guys in movies and it comes out in major papers and no one gets in trouble!
[02:08:20.427 --> 02:08:27.749]  It really is, and I think maybe one way to look at it that will help people understand it is that we're talking about a brutal empire.
[02:08:27.909 --> 02:08:28.630]  The U.S.
[02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:32.911]  has brutal imperialist power at this point, and look at empires of the past.
[02:08:32.951 --> 02:08:39.733]  They would go in and rape and pillage villages and take people and send them off into slave labors or try to turn them into their own soldiers.
[02:08:39.993 --> 02:08:44.435]  This is exactly what we're seeing happening in Iraq and then other places where the U.S.
[02:08:45.015 --> 02:08:46.856]  Trying to further its agenda at this point.
[02:08:47.156 --> 02:08:57.819]  Now when you say US, the global crime syndicate that seized our country as an engine of this and is turning America itself into a high-tech control grid, you've been over there, you've seen this.
[02:08:58.119 --> 02:09:05.821]  What do you think of the letter from the Iranian president that again is quite gracious and calls Bush's excellency and all this other disgusting stuff?
[02:09:06.301 --> 02:09:07.523]  Unprecedented.
[02:09:08.063 --> 02:09:09.625]  Lost a lot of face doing that.
[02:09:09.945 --> 02:09:16.532]  He took a big risk and literally, Condoleezza Rice used it as toilet paper in front of the entire world.
[02:09:17.686 --> 02:09:25.432]  Yeah, it really is a disgrace, but not surprising, and I'm sure you weren't surprised by this administration's reaction to that letter.
[02:09:25.992 --> 02:09:39.241]  I did, I actually just read the letter in its entirety yesterday and was very impressed, and you know, really, of course it's not surprising that this would make them angry, because it essentially had their number and really asked them extremely pointed questions.
[02:09:39.341 --> 02:09:39.821]  Thank you very much.
[02:09:56.511 --> 02:10:06.354]  Dar, there's no doubt that Bush will probably blow something up when he doesn't, and blame it on Iran, and then if Iran defends itself, that'll be the ultimate outrage, and oh my gosh, can you believe they're fighting back?
[02:10:06.434 --> 02:10:09.835]  So, I think we're going to go into full-bore dictatorship.
[02:10:09.895 --> 02:10:13.015]  Aaron Zellman, JPFO, just said that last hour.
[02:10:13.035 --> 02:10:15.016]  A lot of people are using the dictator word.
[02:10:16.434 --> 02:10:24.918]  Right, and that is a deep concern, and I think, you know, my question at this point is, what will happen, you know, how will they go about doing this?
[02:10:25.018 --> 02:10:36.483]  Because if we look at how other regimes in the past have done this, for example, Germany, it was the collapse of the economy that precipitated it, and I wouldn't be so surprised to see something like that happen here as well.
[02:10:37.784 --> 02:10:39.424]  Gold's over $7.04 last time I checked.
[02:10:42.826 --> 02:10:46.428]  And I think that's a big indicator, and I think that's really just the beginning.
[02:10:46.488 --> 02:10:54.490]  I think we should all expect that to really continue to go through the roof as more and more people say, hey, I better do what I can to get out of this.
[02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:57.391]  By the way, Dar Jamal, we have the official Israeli 1983-84 plan.
[02:10:57.411 --> 02:11:02.573]  We put up a curtain email article about it a few days ago, but it's been in the Jerusalem Post.
[02:11:02.933 --> 02:11:04.395]  Where they said we'll use the U.S.
[02:11:04.415 --> 02:11:05.937]  to break it up in three to four parts.
[02:11:06.317 --> 02:11:07.599]  We want a quagmire.
[02:11:07.939 --> 02:11:10.542]  Our own Pentagon documents agree with Israel's analysis.
[02:11:10.883 --> 02:11:12.765]  They want our economy to fall apart.
[02:11:12.825 --> 02:11:15.769]  They want to get into a slug out with Iran.
[02:11:15.809 --> 02:11:19.693]  They want to force the American people to get sucked into World War III.
[02:11:19.974 --> 02:11:21.796]  And Bush is now calling it World War III!
[02:11:23.065 --> 02:11:47.046]  Right, and you know, there's inextricable links between this administration and the Zionists in Israel, and the fact that now, again, just in the last week with, I guess it's Joe Biden talking about dividing Iraq into three, and like this is some sort of legitimate policy that would offer some sort of solution, and you said it, really, and this information's been out there for decades.
[02:11:48.068 --> 02:11:51.216]  The Israeli cause wants a rock split into three sort of volumes.
[02:11:51.236 --> 02:11:53.021]  They want the whole Middle East balkanized!
[02:11:53.923 --> 02:11:54.664]  Right, right.
[02:11:54.724 --> 02:11:57.286]  And unfortunately, right now, that is what we're seeing.
[02:11:57.326 --> 02:12:02.470]  And I think Iran would be another huge step towards furthering that or broadening that.
[02:12:02.731 --> 02:12:13.500]  Well, I hope the liberals find out that Bush and Fox hired a PR firm for the illegal alien demonstrations and that their own official plan says they have a balkanization plan for this country.
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:15.481]  People who say, well, why can't the Arabs get it?
[02:12:15.822 --> 02:12:17.143]  Why are they fighting with each other?
[02:12:17.203 --> 02:12:18.063]  Why can't they see it?
[02:12:18.344 --> 02:12:21.086]  It's the same plan here in America, folks, and we can't see it either.
[02:12:22.122 --> 02:12:23.563]  Well, I think that's a very good point.
[02:12:23.663 --> 02:12:30.745]  And, you know, another... where we caught a little glimpse of this a little ways back is when a lot of press came out about the U.S.
[02:12:30.926 --> 02:12:33.627]  making up and planting false news stories in Iraq.
[02:12:33.707 --> 02:12:43.691]  And they, of course, well, oh, but they consider the fact that those might be read by people back over here, and there's essentially blowback happening here regarding their media tactics.
[02:12:43.791 --> 02:12:45.772]  And, well, certainly that's intentional.
[02:12:45.812 --> 02:12:51.794]  Well, it was ruled that it's illegal that Bush spent $1.6 billion for fake news here, and he said, I'm above the law, I'll keep doing it.
[02:12:52.678 --> 02:13:05.243]  Right, which another report which I imagine you've discussed that came out I saw last week that he's broken at minimum 755 laws since he's been sitting in the position of president.
[02:13:07.054 --> 02:13:07.895]  Right, right.
[02:13:07.975 --> 02:13:09.456]  As well as domestically, yeah.
[02:13:09.476 --> 02:13:15.642]  So it's really, you know, I think it's very clear it's a no-brainer to say that we shouldn't put anything past these individuals.
[02:13:15.682 --> 02:13:16.803]  They're capable of anything.
[02:13:16.843 --> 02:13:19.746]  You've been over in the Middle East for months and months every year.
[02:13:20.326 --> 02:13:22.008]  Are they just in complete horror?
[02:13:22.048 --> 02:13:24.049]  Do they realize how serious things are here?
[02:13:25.791 --> 02:13:26.251]  Who's that?
[02:13:26.672 --> 02:13:30.175]  I mean, just the general population of Iraq and others.
[02:13:30.215 --> 02:13:33.238]  Do they realize how serious things are here in the U.S.? ?
[02:13:34.291 --> 02:13:35.892]  I don't think so, unfortunately.
[02:13:35.952 --> 02:13:41.934]  I think a lot of that's because the situation there is so dire that people are essentially in survival mode.
[02:13:42.394 --> 02:13:51.417]  So those that do get a chance to read some of the media and understand what's happening over here are very concerned and do have a pretty clear idea of what's happening.
[02:13:51.497 --> 02:13:59.160]  But most people are unfortunately literally in a survival mode of, let's hope we don't get blown up today and how can we get some food today?
[02:14:00.564 --> 02:14:05.028]  I just can't believe how evil we've become and how we're being used for such evil.
[02:14:05.728 --> 02:14:11.993]  I mean, the Germans were pretty moral people before World War II, and look how they got seduced into wickedness.
[02:14:12.413 --> 02:14:14.715]  Look at the Russians with the Soviets.
[02:14:14.755 --> 02:14:15.356]  Look at it all.
[02:14:16.605 --> 02:14:18.768]  I mean, Dar, it's really happening!
[02:14:18.808 --> 02:14:20.971]  We're sitting here like the Kursandra effect.
[02:14:21.372 --> 02:14:22.473]  We know what's going to happen.
[02:14:22.493 --> 02:14:23.654]  We knew what was going to happen before.
[02:14:23.694 --> 02:14:24.496]  We were right about it.
[02:14:24.556 --> 02:14:30.583]  And now we're just going to have to watch our whole country go to hell in a handbasket and a bunch of other innocent people die.
[02:14:30.603 --> 02:14:32.626]  And they're going to blow the daylights out of Iran.
[02:14:33.046 --> 02:14:34.869]  Israel and others are talking about nuking them.
[02:14:35.746 --> 02:14:53.119]  Well, that's what absolutely astounds me is that here we are sitting here, because I can remember it wasn't that long ago that even under, for example, the Reagan administration, which of course I was no fan of, but they of course abhorred even the mention of using nuclear weapons and this sort of thing.
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:59.564]  And now here we have people talking about it like, it's just a different kind of weapon that we're going to use, so get ready for it.
[02:14:59.604 --> 02:15:01.265]  And where's the outcry here?
[02:15:01.365 --> 02:15:03.187]  Why are more people not absolutely
[02:15:03.547 --> 02:15:03.848]  I think so.
[02:15:18.581 --> 02:15:22.544]  You know, I think, I know most Americans are upset and know what's going on.
[02:15:22.584 --> 02:15:23.425]  Just look at the polls.
[02:15:23.525 --> 02:15:31.932]  Bush is now down to 30 in a Gallup poll, and polls are of a speck showing him at 25% from 26, 27 just two weeks ago, so he's plunging.
[02:15:32.392 --> 02:15:35.535]  And again, he's just a figurehead for this whole globalist agenda, but darn!
[02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:40.899]  Still, the population knows what's going on, but they're completely neutralized.
[02:15:41.319 --> 02:15:42.140]  They're impotent.
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:43.341]  They feel impotent.
[02:15:43.361 --> 02:15:47.124]  They just sit there like jellyfish waiting for the other boom to drop.
[02:15:48.016 --> 02:16:05.389]  Well, I agree, and I think that's the big problem, and I think that you mentioned it very specifically earlier about this propaganda campaign being waged at home against the citizens of this country, making everyone feel that, well, they can't do anything, and why go take some sort of action to try to stop this?
[02:16:05.509 --> 02:16:09.432]  And it's been very effective, because people do feel neutralized and impotent.
[02:16:09.532 --> 02:16:10.193]  Oh, what can I do?
[02:16:10.273 --> 02:16:11.774]  It's not going to make any difference anyway.
[02:16:11.814 --> 02:16:17.158]  And the reality is that that is a facade, that it really wouldn't take that much of
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:23.706]  of a movement of people standing up to change things that are the direction that this country is going in right now.
[02:16:23.986 --> 02:16:40.100]  I want to get into some of the things you witnessed in Iraq and some of the new info you've got for us and take some calls, Dar, Jamal, but getting back to John Yoo, who was one of the chief counsels of the White House, how do you get up in front of a thousand CFR members and talk about sexually torturing children?
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:41.481]  I mean, these people scare me.
[02:16:41.541 --> 02:16:41.862]  These are
[02:16:42.322 --> 02:16:44.143]  These are really dark, evil people.
[02:16:44.183 --> 02:16:45.044]  I don't understand.
[02:16:45.064 --> 02:16:47.866]  I mean, they are just so evil right out in the open.
[02:16:47.886 --> 02:16:49.247]  They're a bunch of Jeffrey Dahmers.
[02:16:50.108 --> 02:16:50.468]  They are.
[02:16:50.508 --> 02:17:03.657]  They're absolute lunatics, and I think that's a critical thing that as many people in this country understand that they're not just sick, they're not just demented, they're not just profit-driven, but these people are absolute lunatics.
[02:17:04.037 --> 02:17:09.061]  They will argue this in public shamelessly, but the good part of that is
[02:17:09.461 --> 02:17:16.604]  We see very clearly what we're dealing with and what they're capable of and that they're not going to stop at anything in regards to their agenda.
[02:17:16.644 --> 02:17:26.548]  And I think people need to understand this and that these people are literal war criminals as well as, I think, it could be argued that they're criminally insane as well.
[02:17:27.129 --> 02:17:28.629]  No, I mean, exactly.
[02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:34.572]  I mean, old social architects would do things smoothly and very coldly, but they wouldn't dance around
[02:17:35.405 --> 02:17:41.359]  I mean, Richard Perle goes to dinner parties and brags to women that he's ordered the deaths of thousands.
[02:17:41.399 --> 02:17:42.702]  I mean, this isn't the mainstream news.
[02:17:42.742 --> 02:17:43.764]  These people are sick!
[02:17:46.172 --> 02:17:56.901]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:17:57.082 --> 02:18:04.668]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:04.928 --> 02:18:08.071]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:18:08.331 --> 02:18:14.053]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:18:14.353 --> 02:18:20.495]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:18:20.855 --> 02:18:24.756]  The Berkelyte is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:18:24.796 --> 02:18:26.677]  The water level is always visible.
[02:18:26.877 --> 02:18:32.821]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:18:33.062 --> 02:18:37.005]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:37.025 --> 02:18:37.745]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[02:18:47.942 --> 02:18:48.983]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.384 --> 02:18:54.870]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.451 --> 02:18:55.951]  That's right.
[02:18:56.252 --> 02:18:58.554]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.875 --> 02:19:06.043]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.579 --> 02:19:14.283]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.723 --> 02:19:19.526]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:20.189 --> 02:19:25.615]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:26.015 --> 02:19:30.139]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[02:19:45.856 --> 02:19:48.298]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.818 --> 02:19:58.544]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:19:58.724 --> 02:20:03.206]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:20:03.226 --> 02:20:08.590]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[02:20:09.390 --> 02:20:19.639]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[02:20:20.599 --> 02:20:28.346]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:28.986 --> 02:20:30.428]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.448 --> 02:20:30.829]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.849 --> 02:20:31.289]  Call now.
[02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:33.953]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:45.949 --> 02:20:47.790]  Gas prices are out of control.
[02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:52.191]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[02:20:52.531 --> 02:20:57.073]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[02:20:57.253 --> 02:21:01.754]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using
[02:21:03.035 --> 02:21:08.038]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[02:21:08.198 --> 02:21:12.921]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved, and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[02:21:13.102 --> 02:21:21.007]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money-saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG caps.
[02:21:21.307 --> 02:21:25.491]  Yes, MPG cabs are designed for use in all gasoline or diesel powered engines.
[02:21:25.871 --> 02:21:31.897]  And you can also have a lucrative home-based business by simply sharing this amazing, money-saving product with others.
[02:21:32.057 --> 02:21:32.577]  Don't wait!
[02:21:32.697 --> 02:21:34.439]  Call MPG Biz now at 800-526-1778.
[02:21:34.499 --> 02:21:34.679]  That's 800-526-1778.
[02:21:34.699 --> 02:21:36.861]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:36.961 --> 02:21:37.422]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:53.767 --> 02:21:59.452]  My friends, I don't mean to bring up the dying cord child kidnapping ring so much, but how can I not?
[02:22:00.974 --> 02:22:03.656]  How can I not talk about Halliburton KBR?
[02:22:04.697 --> 02:22:08.761]  A caller raised it before DAR came on in the first segment of this hour.
[02:22:09.542 --> 02:22:11.604]  I mean, they really are doing this.
[02:22:12.105 --> 02:22:13.746]  They really are arguing for it.
[02:22:14.327 --> 02:22:15.488]  These people are
[02:22:16.281 --> 02:22:29.252]  Horrible monsters out in front of everyone, and then I hear neocons on talk radio going, turn the whole place into a parking lot, but then two-thirds of Americans in a major study can't even find Iraq on a map.
[02:22:30.654 --> 02:22:39.021]  It is painfully obvious that this country's gone to hell in a handbasket, and don't just think we're going to have an elite that does things like this to women and children
[02:22:40.226 --> 02:22:42.349]  overseas and gets away with it.
[02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:43.830]  They're not going to pull scams here.
[02:22:43.871 --> 02:22:44.952]  They are pulling scams.
[02:22:45.433 --> 02:22:47.155]  Dar, I mean, I've been bringing up a lot of issues.
[02:22:47.175 --> 02:22:48.557]  What are some issues you want to discuss?
[02:22:48.577 --> 02:22:49.578]  Some things you want to talk about?
[02:22:50.476 --> 02:23:02.245]  Well, I think, again, it's beating another dead horse, but one that we have to keep bringing to the attention of as many people as possible is the fact that the situation in Iraq, it's not just staying the same.
[02:23:02.765 --> 02:23:07.869]  Everyone knows it's in bad shape and there's many, many problems there, but it's horrific.
[02:23:07.929 --> 02:23:09.611]  It's an atrocity there every day.
[02:23:10.331 --> 02:23:14.495]  Even the Baghdad morgue reports an average of 85 bodies a day being brought in.
[02:23:15.516 --> 02:23:21.542]  Bodies are turning up daily from death squads, of course, which were started by John Negroponte when he was the U.S.
[02:23:21.602 --> 02:23:22.503]  Ambassador there.
[02:23:23.124 --> 02:23:26.908]  And the situation is just in total meltdown mode where
[02:23:27.528 --> 02:23:35.871]  Uh, another study found that approximately one-third of all the children there are deeply malnourished, which is even worse than during the sanctions.
[02:23:36.231 --> 02:23:41.693]  Violence continues unabated and it's simply only continuing to get worse and will continue to get worse.
[02:23:41.773 --> 02:23:44.514]  And the official Pentagon plan was to balkanize.
[02:23:44.854 --> 02:23:46.915]  Their public plan is to bring them freedom and
[02:23:47.655 --> 02:23:50.217]  Popsicles and happiness in Disney World.
[02:23:50.537 --> 02:23:54.379]  But the real plan is to break it up in three to four parts and have everyone killing each other.
[02:23:54.679 --> 02:24:00.062]  And even Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst, says that he believes our government was behind the big mosque bombing.
[02:24:01.194 --> 02:24:02.835]  Well, and I actually believe that, too.
[02:24:02.855 --> 02:24:17.605]  I believe there's irrefutable proof coming from several witnesses at that scene, as well as one person in one of the Iraqi ministries who came out and made that accusation, as well as one of the leading Shia clerics, Muqtada al-Sadr, immediately blamed U.S.
[02:24:17.665 --> 02:24:19.907]  slash Israel slash the U.K.
[02:24:19.987 --> 02:24:22.909]  for carrying out a black operation.
[02:24:22.929 --> 02:24:29.393]  Well, we caught MI6's military arm, SAS, dressed up like Arabs shooting police driving around with car bombs.
[02:24:30.431 --> 02:24:31.392]  Right, exactly.
[02:24:31.452 --> 02:24:34.834]  Down in the south and even more recently into Crete, another car.
[02:24:34.895 --> 02:24:35.935]  Very similar incident.
[02:24:36.616 --> 02:24:42.520]  Two so-called Western contractors were caught in an unmarked car with explosives once again.
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:44.622]  And this was just as recently as March.
[02:24:44.722 --> 02:24:47.144]  And by the way, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
[02:24:47.164 --> 02:24:48.905]  A lot of times it's British or U.S.
[02:24:48.985 --> 02:24:50.366]  forces that are catching these people.
[02:24:51.358 --> 02:24:52.679]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:56.163]  In fact, there's been British forces dressing up as U.S.
[02:24:56.223 --> 02:25:01.668]  forces going out to carry out their covert operations, so to say it's a mess is a bit of an understatement.
[02:25:02.649 --> 02:25:05.251]  You've been in Iraq quite a bit over the last three years.
[02:25:05.311 --> 02:25:06.913]  Who's doing most of the dirty work?
[02:25:07.113 --> 02:25:11.137]  From my research, it looks like the British, then the Israelis, then the Americans.
[02:25:12.316 --> 02:25:16.939]  That is really hard to say, and you're probably a better authority than I am on that.
[02:25:17.139 --> 02:25:37.613]  For sure, we have hard evidence that it's happening, and for sure it's being carried out by, not by Iraqis or the so-called terrorist organizations there, but as far as who's carrying out the most, you're probably a bit more qualified to answer that than me, but without a doubt, it is being carried out by all three entities that you mentioned.
[02:25:38.855 --> 02:25:40.436]  And again, folks, they will trigger it.
[02:25:40.456 --> 02:25:55.989]  When everybody settles down, they'll go blow up a mosque, or blow up a shrine, or blow up a school, and then blame it on, say, Shiites, then they go attack the Sunnis, and then if things settle down again, they'll blow up some Shiite area, and then there is real fighting that ensues after that.
[02:25:56.799 --> 02:26:06.664]  Well, you're exactly right, and I think the important question that people need to ask themselves when we see this sort of thing happen, and as you said, it will happen again, I totally agree, is who benefits?
[02:26:07.144 --> 02:26:19.550]  Does it benefit the Iraqi resistance to go blow up a shrine, you know, a Shia or Sunni shrine, and then cause infighting against the Iraqi people when their main goal is to get the occupation forces out of their country?
[02:26:19.890 --> 02:26:23.352]  Or does it benefit the occupation forces or the powers behind that?
[02:26:24.052 --> 02:26:31.153]  To generate this fighting, which then causes Iraqis to fight more amongst themselves, as opposed to unifying against the occupation forces.
[02:26:32.314 --> 02:26:33.714]  And it's just going to go on forever.
[02:26:33.774 --> 02:26:38.735]  I mean, most Iraqis and Poles I've seen believe it's an inside job, and they've caught them a bunch.
[02:26:39.015 --> 02:26:41.675]  American, British, and Israeli have all been caught red-handed multiple times.
[02:26:41.995 --> 02:26:47.376]  Mainstream news is doing this, but still, some Iraqis get stirred up and get into the middle of this fracas.
[02:26:47.836 --> 02:26:49.077]  Where do you see Iraq going?
[02:26:49.097 --> 02:26:50.997]  They say we'll be there for decades and decades.
[02:26:52.006 --> 02:27:02.328]  Well, without a doubt, just looking at the military documents and the Joint Vision 2020 and the Quadrennial Defense Review Report that came out just this past February, everything points in the same direction.
[02:27:02.428 --> 02:27:04.069]  And this is U.S.
[02:27:04.129 --> 02:27:04.569]  policy.
[02:27:04.609 --> 02:27:06.149]  These are permanent bases.
[02:27:06.209 --> 02:27:07.209]  They are there to stay.
[02:27:07.229 --> 02:27:07.989]  They're not leaving.
[02:27:08.109 --> 02:27:09.590]  So, that's the bad news.
[02:27:10.610 --> 02:27:13.571]  We're going to come back and take calls on any issue you wish to discuss, listeners.
[02:27:13.611 --> 02:27:15.611]  It all ties back into this global empire.
[02:27:16.602 --> 02:27:20.785]  And we'll get into any other key issues that Dar Jamal wants to discuss and what he's going to be doing in the future.
[02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:22.866]  This man has unbelievable courage.
[02:27:22.886 --> 02:27:24.067]  We're honored to have him.
[02:27:24.167 --> 02:27:26.008]  And I've just, I've got to cover Iraq, folks.
[02:27:26.149 --> 02:27:26.989]  I am ashamed.
[02:27:27.009 --> 02:27:28.510]  I feel dirty.
[02:27:29.291 --> 02:27:31.812]  This will not be done in my name or my family's name.
[02:27:32.413 --> 02:27:34.074]  I am totally against this dirty war.
[02:27:36.155 --> 02:27:37.076]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.556 --> 02:27:39.157]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.177 --> 02:27:42.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.283 --> 02:27:53.167]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.308 --> 02:28:06.196]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:06.476 --> 02:28:08.218]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:28:08.378 --> 02:28:11.841]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:28:12.121 --> 02:28:15.904]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:28:16.165 --> 02:28:21.149]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:28:21.409 --> 02:28:23.091]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:28:23.371 --> 02:28:27.353]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:28:27.593 --> 02:28:29.434]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:28:48.061 --> 02:28:52.183]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.303 --> 02:28:55.185]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.265 --> 02:29:01.988]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.168 --> 02:29:05.170]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.370 --> 02:29:07.751]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.891 --> 02:29:12.614]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.794 --> 02:29:22.098]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[02:29:22.258 --> 02:29:27.361]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:30:46.734 --> 02:30:51.796]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.569 --> 02:30:54.930]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.691 --> 02:31:06.037]  We're gonna go back to Dar Jamal here in just three minutes, then we'll go to Dan and Charlie and Thomas and Bobby and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:09.550]  I'll tell you about Darja Maul's website and a lot more.
[02:31:09.570 --> 02:31:12.631]  We have links to it on InfoWars.com, but I promise to do this.
[02:31:12.671 --> 02:31:19.512]  This is one of the new tracks off of Neil Young's new album, and at least he woke up.
[02:31:19.532 --> 02:31:30.854]  I mean, he bought into the propaganda day one after the government staged 9-11, but now he's really woken up, and here's just one of many tracks off of his new album that he's released for free over the Internet.
[02:31:30.934 --> 02:31:31.274]  Here it is.
[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:04.021]  We're good to go.
[02:32:32.116 --> 02:32:38.781]  What will people do after the garden is gone?
[02:32:38.821 --> 02:32:44.145]  What will people say after the garden is gone?
[02:33:08.642 --> 02:33:16.106]  Don't need no strong man walking through the night to live a weak man's day.
[02:33:19.307 --> 02:33:25.030]  Won't need no purple haze, won't need no sun shining after the dark.
[02:33:40.837 --> 02:33:44.578]  Alright folks, that's part of that track.
[02:33:44.678 --> 02:33:51.419]  There's a bunch of others that are even better.
[02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:06.849]  It's not the best if you download it off the web for some reason.
[02:34:06.869 --> 02:34:07.929]  It sounds better online.
[02:34:08.349 --> 02:34:10.150]  You can just type in Neil Young's new album.
[02:34:10.170 --> 02:34:11.371]  You can find it all over the internet.
[02:34:12.011 --> 02:34:20.534]  Darja Maul, it is good news that even people that were sucked into the propaganda, like Neil Young, are now waking up to the fact that America is becoming a dictatorship.
[02:34:21.643 --> 02:34:40.910]  Well, yeah, and you mentioned it earlier with the polls showing, you know, the best case polls showing that Bush's approval rating is down to 30% and, you know, who these people are is probably, you know, the folks that are still hanging on to this agenda, the folks that Stephen Colbert mentioned as being the backwash in his talk recently in Washington, D.C.
[02:34:41.010 --> 02:34:45.312]  But, yeah, without a doubt, I think it's very clear that that is the good news.
[02:34:45.412 --> 02:34:48.833]  We are in the majority now as far as people really see what's happening here.
[02:34:49.233 --> 02:34:51.175]  See what the agenda of these people actually is.
[02:35:05.033 --> 02:35:08.556]  Well, yeah, I kind of go back and forth on that.
[02:35:08.576 --> 02:35:26.551]  On my more cynical days, I do come off as it being more of a foregone conclusion, but I do think, without a doubt, that with some very effective organizing and more people really getting it, that I think that enough hell could be raised here, basically, to stop that from happening.
[02:35:26.651 --> 02:35:30.134]  But I'm not an organizer myself, so I don't really understand.
[02:35:30.894 --> 02:35:34.397]  What would be the best and most effective technique?
[02:35:34.497 --> 02:35:38.761]  What was the most uplifting thing in all your time you spent in the Middle East and Iraq and other areas?
[02:35:38.801 --> 02:35:44.086]  What was the most uplifting thing you witnessed and what was the most painful, saddening thing that you witnessed?
[02:35:45.399 --> 02:35:56.524]  I think the most uplifting thing is that now, by far and away, the most recent poll I saw was 92% of Iraqis are totally against the occupation and really see the U.S.
[02:35:56.584 --> 02:36:03.527]  agenda and really get that this has nothing to do with bringing them liberation or freedom or any of those other nice propaganda terms.
[02:36:05.328 --> 02:36:06.009]  We're good to go.
[02:36:26.136 --> 02:36:26.817]  They did, yeah.
[02:36:26.877 --> 02:36:32.805]  Most people there are very clear in knowing that the only solution isn't into the occupation.
[02:36:32.845 --> 02:36:40.476]  Let me just say this, whenever I talk to Arabs on the street or I talk to even Kurds, and there's a lot of folks that live here in Austin,
[02:36:41.016 --> 02:36:47.581]  With the University Town, or when I talk to people who consider themselves to be Persian, they are really tuned into world politics.
[02:36:47.601 --> 02:36:49.763]  They really understand that you can't trust governments.
[02:36:50.083 --> 02:36:51.504]  They don't trust their own governments.
[02:36:51.764 --> 02:36:52.865]  They're not naive.
[02:36:53.205 --> 02:36:56.808]  And then you talk to Americans, or even Europeans, and they're just in la-la land.
[02:36:57.652 --> 02:37:16.305]  Yeah, you're exactly right, and that kind of ties in with what I was saying, is politically they're much more astute and advanced and worldly in understanding that all governments use propaganda and have their own agendas, and it doesn't behoove, that agenda does not help the average citizen in that country, and they're very up on that, very up on what the U.S.
[02:37:16.385 --> 02:37:19.408]  is doing there, including their plans for Iran.
[02:37:19.608 --> 02:37:22.670]  The second part, what was the most horrible thing you've seen in Iraq?
[02:37:24.082 --> 02:37:37.821]  I think whenever I'm asked that, I always think of when I was in Fallujah and watching women and children being brought into the clinic where I was, covering the situation from all of them being shot by U.S.
[02:37:37.861 --> 02:37:40.344]  snipers and hit by bombs from warplanes.
[02:37:40.865 --> 02:37:45.089]  You know, because in war, that is always the population that suffers the most.
[02:37:45.329 --> 02:37:50.013]  The innocent, the unarmed, the people that simply get caught up in the crossfire.
[02:37:50.093 --> 02:37:53.075]  And watching that was really devastating.
[02:37:53.095 --> 02:37:56.678]  And I was watching that with a man in the clinic who said the same thing.
[02:37:57.279 --> 02:37:59.401]  I was raised believing that the U.S.
[02:37:59.441 --> 02:38:00.161]  and the U.K.
[02:38:00.241 --> 02:38:04.305]  had people's best interests in mind, and now I don't believe that again for a second.
[02:38:07.381 --> 02:38:11.964]  I wish Americans could go see the dead toddlers, at least go look at the photos online.
[02:38:12.004 --> 02:38:18.008]  I mean, dead babies, when they shoot their mouth off about, just kill every one of them Arabs!
[02:38:19.229 --> 02:38:21.110]  It's just so... They attacked us!
[02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:22.491]  No, number one, they didn't.
[02:38:23.632 --> 02:38:30.096]  Number two, our government destabilized that region by design and put radical Muslims into power as, quote, a counterweight to the Soviets.
[02:38:30.777 --> 02:38:33.038]  And number three, it's just the whole thing shameful, Dar.
[02:38:33.058 --> 02:38:42.562]  I mean, even though I fight this, I have a great feeling of shame, because I know America isn't perfect, but America has, on average, been one of the best countries in world history.
[02:38:42.623 --> 02:38:44.824]  We really have been the good guys, and you're a fellow Texan.
[02:38:45.224 --> 02:38:53.367]  And now to see us involved in the dirtiest of sickening imperial dehumanization genocide operations, and I don't use those words lightly,
[02:38:55.251 --> 02:39:01.517]  Number one, I have empathy, and empathy, folks, is knowing something that's happening to somebody else, you feel their pain.
[02:39:01.537 --> 02:39:03.419]  If I feel their pain, you know it can happen to you.
[02:39:03.439 --> 02:39:09.085]  I know my family's in danger when we've got a psychopathic government running these type of operations.
[02:39:09.145 --> 02:39:10.866]  I mean, why do these idiots think they're safe?
[02:39:11.727 --> 02:39:16.512]  Somehow there's a membrane between them and this government, when this government's saying they can kill kids.
[02:39:17.513 --> 02:39:34.459]  Right and I agree it is it's absolutely shameful what's being done over there and it is affecting us all right now and if that's not obvious to people well before too long if things continue on their present course you'll see that it is affecting them directly as well back here on the home front.
[02:39:34.619 --> 02:39:36.660]  I mean do you ever feel ashamed?
[02:39:37.703 --> 02:39:38.644]  Oh, without a doubt.
[02:39:38.724 --> 02:39:46.451]  I mean, that's why most of the time when I walk around there, aside from just security reasons, I don't tell people I'm a citizen of the U.S.
[02:39:46.491 --> 02:40:01.504]  because right now where this country is is a disgrace and short of something closely resembling a revolution, if not revolution itself, I don't know what it's going to take to get it back on track because right now it's as far off track as I can possibly imagine it being.
[02:40:03.504 --> 02:40:15.450]  Well, you said it earlier, these are criminally insane people on power trips who no one is saying no to, and they've just gone completely nuts in front of us, and we have a historical yardstick.
[02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:19.312]  This is what elite emperors and elite plutocracies always do.
[02:40:19.392 --> 02:40:20.813]  They go crazy!
[02:40:21.593 --> 02:40:22.954]  And they've gone crazy!
[02:40:24.022 --> 02:40:31.370]  Right, that old quote of, you know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is certainly what we're witnessing right now.
[02:40:31.450 --> 02:40:34.433]  That these people, it's very clear to them that they have a blank check.
[02:40:34.473 --> 02:40:36.335]  The media is not going to hold them to account.
[02:40:37.036 --> 02:40:38.417]  And until that happens, U.S.
[02:40:38.437 --> 02:40:45.725]  citizens and so many people still don't really see as clearly as they can what's actually being done in their name, so can't stand up to fight against it.
[02:40:46.045 --> 02:40:47.266]  What about conscience?
[02:40:47.446 --> 02:40:50.629]  I mean, you know, they fool good troops who mean well to go along with this.
[02:40:50.669 --> 02:40:53.732]  Now 70 plus percent of the troops are against the war.
[02:40:53.752 --> 02:41:05.141]  I mean, I know they plan to have controlled chaos, order out of chaos, but it seems like Iraq's getting so bad and they can't have a draft on the home front, though they're trying to set it up, it seems like they may have overreached.
[02:41:06.359 --> 02:41:13.205]  I think without a doubt they've overreached and that's why we see even last week it came out that they're training people in the Navy and Air Force.
[02:41:13.225 --> 02:41:17.689]  They're giving them a two-week crash course in combat training and then sending them over to Iraq.
[02:41:17.729 --> 02:41:32.923]  Well that's not why these people join the Navy and the Air Force and I think that's why we are starting to see more and more people go AWOL and more people stand up and at the end of the day the interesting question is going to be is what are these people going to do to fill those boots because even with the mercenaries over there which is
[02:41:33.263 --> 02:41:36.165]  What they're using to avoid the draft right now is paid mercenaries.
[02:41:36.525 --> 02:41:40.567]  Well, even that isn't going to be enough people, so what are they going to do when there's simply not enough troops?
[02:41:40.927 --> 02:41:49.811]  And again, especially once they do engage Iran militarily, they're going to have to do something pretty drastic because there's simply not going to be enough soldiers.
[02:41:49.851 --> 02:41:50.392]  Well, that's simple.
[02:41:50.412 --> 02:41:51.572]  Carry out a terror attack.
[02:41:51.612 --> 02:41:52.673]  Claim Iran did it.
[02:41:52.733 --> 02:41:53.813]  Have the national draft.
[02:41:54.294 --> 02:41:57.315]  Anyone who's criticized the governments with the terrorists has to be arrested.
[02:41:57.335 --> 02:41:58.856]  Emergency FEMA centers built.
[02:41:59.236 --> 02:42:00.016]  Houston Chronicle.
[02:42:00.056 --> 02:42:01.157]  We can see what they're going to do, Dar.
[02:42:02.391 --> 02:42:02.951]  Yeah, it is.
[02:42:03.391 --> 02:42:08.073]  It is a pretty... many potentially dark scenarios here coming up in the future.
[02:42:08.113 --> 02:42:15.996]  Again, I think the question is really not if, but when, because they're going to have to take some extraordinary measures to go into Iran.
[02:42:16.016 --> 02:42:17.516]  I really don't see how they can just do it.
[02:42:17.636 --> 02:42:18.377]  You know what this is like?
[02:42:18.437 --> 02:42:22.278]  It's like being tied down to the railroad tracks and seeing the train coming.
[02:42:22.904 --> 02:42:27.488]  And then you're begging people to untie you, but they're tied down too, basically.
[02:42:28.048 --> 02:42:31.451]  And they just are smiling at you, going, no, no, it's good, it's good.
[02:42:31.751 --> 02:42:33.072]  That train's coming to love me.
[02:42:36.235 --> 02:42:37.276]  Here's a better analogy.
[02:42:37.576 --> 02:42:41.219]  They're volunteering to lay there.
[02:42:41.239 --> 02:42:42.260]  They're not even tied down.
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:43.621]  We're tied down.
[02:42:43.881 --> 02:42:49.046]  We're begging them to untie us and for them to go off the tracks, and they're telling us, no, the train's coming to love them.
[02:42:50.247 --> 02:42:51.327]  Well, I think it's good.
[02:42:52.324 --> 02:43:05.738]  More people get the urgency, and that's why I'm glad that you keep talking about this, because that's what I, every time I'm getting information almost daily from my sources in Iraq, it's a dire, urgent situation that needs to be changed immediately.
[02:43:05.818 --> 02:43:14.567]  And, you know, that's, I think, the intention that we need to get out to people here in the U.S., that, you know, the time to act and do something to effect some changes right now.
[02:43:16.588 --> 02:43:23.070]  You know, I would hope that the old-line elite, who aren't perfect, they're definitely corrupt, would try to control the neocons.
[02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:32.032]  They've been putting out signals like that's the case, but I really think they're just using the neocons for a larger agenda, and they're going to cut them loose later and blame them.
[02:43:32.512 --> 02:43:33.772]  This is so diabolical.
[02:43:34.312 --> 02:43:35.232]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:43:35.452 --> 02:43:37.633]  Before we do that, Darja Mall, tell folks about your website.
[02:43:38.769 --> 02:43:44.592]  Yeah, I have a website that I maintain with fresh information from Iraq, and it's DarjahMailIraq.com.
[02:43:44.632 --> 02:43:49.975]  It's D-A-H-R-J-A-M-A-I-L-I-R-A-C.com.
[02:43:50.155 --> 02:43:55.998]  And you also, we have a link over to your site at Infowars.com, but you've got a book coming out soon, and I want to carry it.
[02:43:57.128 --> 02:43:58.849]  Well, yeah, I wouldn't say soon.
[02:43:59.089 --> 02:44:00.450]  I'm certainly working on one.
[02:44:00.470 --> 02:44:02.431]  That's my main project right now.
[02:44:02.651 --> 02:44:08.474]  I'll have to let you know once it is in the near future, but right now it's still a little ways out.
[02:44:08.714 --> 02:44:09.494]  Fantastic.
[02:44:09.954 --> 02:44:12.256]  Of all these calls here, guys, who's up first?
[02:44:14.457 --> 02:44:16.017]  Dan in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:44:16.057 --> 02:44:16.478]  Go ahead.
[02:44:16.978 --> 02:44:17.398]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:17.498 --> 02:44:18.018]  It's an honor.
[02:44:18.399 --> 02:44:19.219]  Nice talking to you.
[02:44:19.819 --> 02:44:21.780]  I'd like to go back about 16 years.
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.082]  I was an avid listener to Chuck Harter, the Chuck Harter Show.
[02:44:26.084 --> 02:44:37.387]  And I would have to say probably hundreds of thousands tuned in to Chuck, and he kind of covered a lot of these, the same things you've been covering, but in kind of a later date, or an earlier date.
[02:44:38.547 --> 02:44:50.050]  Anyways, what I wanted to mention, one of the themes back then was kind of an America where our troops are overtaxed in another country, something goes wrong here, and we have to bring in the blue hats.
[02:44:51.150 --> 02:44:55.051]  And you go back to 1990, and you just think that was so far-fetched.
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:57.722]  So far fetched that something like that could never happen.
[02:44:59.023 --> 02:45:00.444]  Sir, I saw U.N.
[02:45:00.504 --> 02:45:02.786]  General McKenzie, the head of U.N.
[02:45:02.826 --> 02:45:19.338]  Peacekeeping, two days after 9-11 on Nightline say, that's not true, it was seven days after, it was the next week, say that they were going to use foreign troops in America while we were tied down in the war on terror, and they've signed agreements with foreign governments to do just that.
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:23.762]  Well, what we see here now is just one war going on,
[02:45:24.215 --> 02:45:26.798]  And they're dipping into Navy, Air Force people.
[02:45:26.878 --> 02:45:29.681]  If something else happens, you know, you just kind of wonder.
[02:45:29.982 --> 02:45:31.363]  Yeah, look at what Bush is doing.
[02:45:31.684 --> 02:45:33.926]  They know they can't even subdue Iraq.
[02:45:34.186 --> 02:45:37.570]  They could have if they tried it first, but they set this up and now it's out of control.
[02:45:37.971 --> 02:45:40.133]  And then now they want to go into Iran and Syria.
[02:45:40.173 --> 02:45:40.574]  Darjahmal?
[02:45:41.930 --> 02:45:42.230]  Right.
[02:45:42.611 --> 02:45:42.891]  It is.
[02:45:42.911 --> 02:45:44.132]  It's absolute lunacy.
[02:45:44.152 --> 02:45:53.257]  I mean, I think that's a very strong argument that it is certainly intentional, because, you know, they can't even sustain Iraq right now, let alone talking about any place else.
[02:45:53.377 --> 02:45:56.939]  It's total lunacy, and it is setting up very well for that scenario.
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:07.426]  Well, Iran's 64 million, Iraq's 21, 22 million, and the Iranians are, I mean, had absolutely nothing and defeated Saddam when the U.S.
[02:46:07.466 --> 02:46:08.827]  pumped 30 plus billion in.
[02:46:09.850 --> 02:46:16.673]  You know, in the Iranian President's letter, he talks about, you started a war against us, you overthrew us, you did all this stuff.
[02:46:18.033 --> 02:46:19.214]  Go ahead and finish up, caller, sorry.
[02:46:20.234 --> 02:46:21.955]  I wanted to mention Fadar and yourself.
[02:46:22.035 --> 02:46:25.176]  I talked to, about a month ago or so, where I live, a troop.
[02:46:25.196 --> 02:46:28.298]  He was served in Afghanistan and also Iraq.
[02:46:28.338 --> 02:46:29.498]  I'd say he was in his twenties.
[02:46:29.698 --> 02:46:33.700]  And he told me something, I don't want to say shocking, but it was kind of upsetting.
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:35.981]  We were talking about females in the army.
[02:46:36.582 --> 02:46:49.051]  And, uh, the subject was, yes, they're in there, they're intervening, and, uh, they were a driver, this particular guy was a driver of a convoy, and they have standing orders, if somebody gets out in the street, they have to run them over.
[02:46:50.352 --> 02:47:04.342]  And in this case, uh, a child did run out, and she stopped, and the fellow I was talking to was part of a squad, and sure enough, people came out of the, uh, the sewer, or whatever, and attacked these people, the, uh, the convoy.
[02:47:05.618 --> 02:47:14.922]  Long story short, she gets reprimanded, or in Article 15, not for stopping, but for endangering the rest of her unit.
[02:47:15.122 --> 02:47:22.145]  Yeah, if there's ambushes going on, they should have armored units with the trucks to then deal with that, not run over the child.
[02:47:22.586 --> 02:47:34.311]  Well, the point I want to make, I mean, let's just say you're in your 20s, you go over there and serve, and God bless the military, we've got a great service, and I can understand the Army for doing that, because if they do stop,
[02:47:34.690 --> 02:47:39.174]  Maybe half the time, it is something, an actual ambush.
[02:47:39.674 --> 02:47:48.281]  But the idea that you serve your country, go over there, and actually end up running over children, psychologically, I think that's going to affect a lot of people.
[02:47:48.301 --> 02:47:48.821]  No, I agree with you.
[02:47:48.861 --> 02:47:55.246]  Then we have the extreme of that, the trophy videos, where they just drive down the highway for fun, shooting cars randomly.
[02:47:55.306 --> 02:47:56.247]  Have you seen that video?
[02:47:57.508 --> 02:48:00.690]  I've seen clips of it, I think, on your site, yes.
[02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:02.151]  Playing Elvis music over it.
[02:48:02.171 --> 02:48:02.812]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:03.730 --> 02:48:04.370]  I gotta let you go.
[02:48:04.451 --> 02:48:05.371]  Dar, comments to that?
[02:48:06.171 --> 02:48:23.140]  Yeah, I think that's a really important point, and I think, you know, not to excuse when a soldier does break international laws at Geneva Conventions, but it really just highlights the fact that the powers that be have created an atrocity-producing situation in Iraq, and that's what we have there.
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:26.001]  And any soldier who's been over there is now going to be part of that.
[02:48:26.301 --> 02:48:26.781]  Exactly.
[02:48:26.841 --> 02:48:29.803]  Listen, they fired a bunch of top generals who were neocons,
[02:48:30.811 --> 02:48:32.593]  Because they said we gotta have 500,000 troops.
[02:48:32.713 --> 02:48:35.175]  I mean, they knew this was gonna happen, Dar.
[02:48:35.795 --> 02:48:37.056]  Right.
[02:48:37.116 --> 02:48:37.897]  It's unbelievable.
[02:48:37.957 --> 02:48:40.299]  We'll be right back with a few final calls with Dar Jamal.
[02:48:40.319 --> 02:48:40.799]  Stay with us.
[02:48:47.071 --> 02:48:49.933]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.193 --> 02:48:51.774]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.114 --> 02:48:56.777]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.118 --> 02:49:03.862]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.182 --> 02:49:06.162]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.363 --> 02:49:09.203]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.303 --> 02:49:13.964]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.164 --> 02:49:18.565]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.805 --> 02:49:26.047]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.287 --> 02:49:28.708]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:46.514 --> 02:49:51.740]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:59.970]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:07.278]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.418 --> 02:50:08.379]  We're good to go!
[02:50:29.059 --> 02:50:29.319]  I think?
[02:50:47.617 --> 02:50:47.957]  I think so.
[02:51:02.865 --> 02:51:03.525]  We're good to go!

[02:51:35.647 --> 02:51:41.512]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:47.676 --> 02:51:51.840]  The globalists are experts in propaganda, public relations, mind control.
[02:51:52.421 --> 02:51:58.227]  They put our troops in a bad position and then, well, we can't give up, we can't turn tail and run, we can't run up the wide fly.
[02:51:58.247 --> 02:52:00.049]  We've got to support the troops by keeping them there.
[02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:02.311]  You support them by bringing them home.
[02:52:02.551 --> 02:52:06.736]  In fact, if you hate the Arabs so much and want them all to die, fine, let them all stay there and kill themselves.
[02:52:07.156 --> 02:52:07.997]  That's not going to happen.
[02:52:09.071 --> 02:52:15.977]  In fact, all the major studies show if we pull out, things will get a lot better a lot quicker, and they knew that when the British were there, you know, 90 years ago.
[02:52:16.357 --> 02:52:17.137]  We're almost out of time.
[02:52:17.157 --> 02:52:18.098]  I want to jam everybody in.
[02:52:18.118 --> 02:52:19.379]  Everybody just gets a quick comment.
[02:52:19.399 --> 02:52:21.241]  Sorry to all the callers here, but I've got to move here.
[02:52:21.781 --> 02:52:23.723]  Chuck in Indiana, you're on the air with Darja Maul.
[02:52:23.763 --> 02:52:24.103]  Go ahead.
[02:52:24.543 --> 02:52:24.924]  Hello, Alex.
[02:52:25.204 --> 02:52:25.424]  Hi.
[02:52:25.824 --> 02:52:31.689]  I was just wondering, you know, if we're going to go and invade Iran like everybody's talking about, number one,
[02:52:33.544 --> 02:52:35.506]  Who's going to finance this fiasco?
[02:52:35.566 --> 02:52:40.350]  And number two, where are all the boots on the ground going to come from to go over there and invade the country?
[02:52:40.591 --> 02:52:41.331]  We don't have any.
[02:52:41.411 --> 02:52:55.784]  The globalists are going to carry out a terror attack, or if Iran doesn't attack back when they get attacked, then they're going to have a national draft, and we're going to go to full militarization, and then the real Project for a New American Century operation is launched by successive Pearl Harbor events.
[02:52:57.473 --> 02:53:04.799]  Well, I think, you know, the first thing is it's going to be a massive aerial bombardment, so they don't intend to put too many troops in there at the start.
[02:53:04.899 --> 02:53:06.800]  Now, where it goes from there is anybody's guess.
[02:53:06.881 --> 02:53:10.884]  Yeah, then they'll claim it's a security zone and grab that western area that's got half the oil.
[02:53:11.444 --> 02:53:13.446]  Well, I think that's a given, yeah, at that point.
[02:53:13.486 --> 02:53:20.471]  In fact, I've had some reports, I still need to corroborate them, but that there is already a troop buildup going on in southern Iraq with the border of Iran.
[02:53:21.192 --> 02:53:22.833]  Oh, that's been in the mainstream news, Dar.
[02:53:22.873 --> 02:53:23.433]  You may have missed it.
[02:53:24.154 --> 02:53:24.714]  Oh, that has, okay.
[02:53:24.734 --> 02:53:26.736]  There's been a buildup in Basra and other areas.
[02:53:27.535 --> 02:53:28.936]  Right, yeah, right along the border.
[02:53:28.996 --> 02:53:35.499]  So, you know, all the residents there are saying, well, this is exactly what we saw just before Saddam decided to invade Iran that way as well.
[02:53:35.559 --> 02:53:38.621]  Well, Hirsch has reported and it hadn't been denied that U.S.
[02:53:38.641 --> 02:53:41.022]  Special Forces have been in there for a year.
[02:53:41.042 --> 02:53:45.044]  Right, yeah, that and unmanned surveillance drones and things of this nature, without a doubt.
[02:53:45.464 --> 02:53:46.885]  Anything else, Chuck?
[02:53:47.563 --> 02:53:51.207]  Well, there's one other issue I wanted to touch on.
[02:53:51.247 --> 02:53:57.094]  You know, I don't think people have to worry about the government coming around and rounding up all the guns because they're drying up all the ammo.
[02:53:57.134 --> 02:54:00.698]  You can't get 7.62x39mm anywhere anymore.
[02:54:00.719 --> 02:54:01.720]  That's happening.
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:02.641]  That really is happening.
[02:54:03.041 --> 02:54:12.108]  And, uh, you know, I've got many .308 rifles that I use for sport shooting and whatnot, and they're semi-automatic military-style rifles, and you just can't get the ammunition for them anymore.
[02:54:12.128 --> 02:54:12.888]  It's just gone.
[02:54:12.908 --> 02:54:13.769]  I hear you.
[02:54:13.889 --> 02:54:14.750]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:15.871]  Thomas in Michigan.
[02:54:15.891 --> 02:54:17.111]  I think that's all we have time for.
[02:54:17.152 --> 02:54:18.352]  Sorry to Bobby in Texas.
[02:54:18.673 --> 02:54:19.373]  Go ahead, Thomas.
[02:54:20.014 --> 02:54:21.094]  Um, how you guys doing?
[02:54:22.616 --> 02:54:22.996]  We're fine.
[02:54:23.016 --> 02:54:23.336]  Go ahead.
[02:54:23.576 --> 02:54:23.876]  Okay.
[02:54:24.277 --> 02:54:26.819]  I do have a bit of, uh, slightly good news.
[02:54:26.919 --> 02:54:31.222]  There are, on my local college campus in Warrensburg, Missouri, there are some people
[02:54:32.031 --> 02:54:33.992]  The college Republicans who are waking up.
[02:54:34.852 --> 02:54:42.355]  I've been told that they don't like George Bush, but that group's been infiltrated by neocons as well.
[02:54:42.375 --> 02:54:46.936]  So there are people waking up and they're realizing Bush is not conservative.
[02:54:47.357 --> 02:54:48.377]  Neoconservatism?
[02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:49.637]  That's an oxymoron.
[02:54:50.478 --> 02:54:56.480]  I think that this invasion of Iran's not going to happen because people are waking up way too fast.
[02:54:57.210 --> 02:54:58.191]  Well, we're in a race.
[02:54:58.251 --> 02:54:58.911]  That's the point.
[02:54:58.951 --> 02:55:02.032]  Will America get untied from the railroad tracks?
[02:55:02.092 --> 02:55:03.753]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:55:03.793 --> 02:55:06.214]  Darjah Mall, it's always wonderful to have you on.

[02:55:09.376 --> 02:55:10.296]  Thanks again for having me.
