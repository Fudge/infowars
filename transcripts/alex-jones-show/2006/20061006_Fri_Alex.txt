[00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:06.646]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.368]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:10.189]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.651]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.312]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:17.696]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:22.260]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:34.479]  TGIF, my friends, hello.
[00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.760]  It is the sixth day of October 2006.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.584]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:48.968]  We're going to be live for the next three hours as we are each and every day from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.150]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.690]  Eastern.
[00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:56.013]  I guess that would be 10 until 1 Mountain and 9 to noon Pacific.
[00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:14.706]  A few days ago we reported on the fact that Lord Chaney had basically had a man with his young son, who was with his young son, arrested for simply walking by and saying,
[00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:17.365]  The war is reprehensible.
[00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:21.046]  And since then, the press has reported that this has happened to a whole bunch.
[00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:27.709]  If you shout something out at Bush or Cheney or say something to them when they're in a public place, you go to jail.
[00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.489]  You don't talk to God.
[00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.410]  You don't talk to the Emperor.
[00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.511]  You don't talk rudely to the King.
[00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:37.913]  And I've heard neocons all over talk radio and the web defending this.
[00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:41.594]  They attempt to shout down everyone that doesn't agree with them.
[00:01:42.952 --> 00:01:52.654]  I heard them locally calling into a radio show yesterday that didn't agree with what Foley's doing, screaming that the person was an evil liberal and he needed to shut up.
[00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:56.675]  I've gotten hundreds of emails last week saying I need to go to a FEMA camp.
[00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:58.136]  Yes, the FEMA camps are real.
[00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:59.856]  They can't wait to put me in it.
[00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:04.297]  You don't care about the Constitution or Bill of Rights, phony conservatives.
[00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:10.508]  You care about worshipping your dear leader, who gives you nothing but an ego boost.
[00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.869]  You just feel like you're part of the power system.
[00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.689]  You're not.
[00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.851]  The system laughs at you, but c'est la vie, you're helping kill America, and that's what really matters to you.
[00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:25.332]  What matters to you is gun control and open borders in the end of this country, because you're a good conservative.
[00:02:27.182 --> 00:02:34.685]  So we will talk to Mr. Howards coming up in the next hour, joining us from Colorado.
[00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:45.910]  In the meantime, back on Monday, Steve Watson, thanks to tips from listeners, put together a really important report.
[00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.634]  The only problem with the report is he didn't herald the incredible bombshell discovery in the first paragraph, but later in the article,
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.880]  It's huge.
[00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.601]  It deserves a lot of attention.
[00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:01.823]  It's gotten quite a bit, but not as much as it needs.
[00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:04.625]  And it desperately needs it and needs it now.
[00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:07.086]  In a big way.
[00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:12.709]  The supposed hijacker confession tape that has no audio
[00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:27.340]  Has been proven to be some Pentagon release that they have been using for years, quote, in the interrogation of detainees at Guantanamo, where they CG in images of them and say, look, we have proof of you.
[00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.976]  And we know that the video has been released over a year ago to be aired in the last year in the U.S.
[00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.979]  and England in the documentary The Road to Guantanamo.
[00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:48.727]  Then it just pops up again, they announce it's the latest release tape by Al-Qaeda, and it turns out that the government has released it and the thing is fake.
[00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:50.529]  This is huge.
[00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.530]  Don't expect newspapers to report it.
[00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.031]  They're not.
[00:03:54.341 --> 00:04:00.384]  Though the Times of London's having to admit the folks that released it, okay, it doesn't come from Al-Qaeda, we don't know where it came from.
[00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:01.325]  Sure, you don't.
[00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:04.927]  This is a huge story.
[00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.969]  We've caught them red-handed staging this stuff.
[00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.372]  Please, there's four different articles, two that Steve did, two that Paul did,
[00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:16.733]  They're up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:16.753 --> 00:04:18.094]  They're up on InfoWars.net.
[00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:21.115]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, they're on the left-hand side.
[00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.296]  No, right-hand side.
[00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:24.017]  There's that News in Focus.
[00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:25.357]  You can click on it.
[00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:28.059]  And everybody should read these articles again.
[00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:28.879]  Everybody should.
[00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:30.240]  And we're asking you.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.402]  Yes, we're asking you to go get the free download of TerrorStorm.
[00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:34.182]  It's on Google Video.
[00:04:34.202 --> 00:04:35.143]  Give it to everybody you know.
[00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:41.506]  We're asking you to go and get the articles and the admissions and the video clips showing that this is all fake.
[00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:43.756]  With these new Al-Qaeda tapes.
[00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:48.200]  I mean, we're trying to save this country and, by extension, the world.
[00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.102]  And it's up to you to spread the word here.
[00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:53.304]  If you move, nothing on Earth can stop you.
[00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:54.926]  Alright, there's all this new news.
[00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.327]  It's all totally insane.
[00:04:56.987 --> 00:04:58.409]  We'll cover it on the other side.
[00:04:58.849 --> 00:04:59.409]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.410]  Please, stay with us.
[00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.981]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:10.243]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:18.309]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:26.034]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:33.319]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:37.871]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:41.672]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:44.033]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.373 --> 00:05:48.274]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:05.590]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.130]  are located?
[00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.733]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.340]  You know, I really wish I could just power my place with solar.
[00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:13.158]  That's what I was saying to myself over and over again for years until I found out about Ken Solar.
[00:07:13.478 --> 00:07:20.060]  Ken has been working with solar power for over a decade and has designed systems for people all over the world.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:29.504]  He's put together customized alternative energy packages for everything from powering the local supermarket all the way down to portable solar power generators.
[00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:41.229]  On-grid, off-grid, big systems or tiny systems, Ken has the proven experience to design a tailored alternative energy system that's just right for you and your budget.
[00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:45.871]  He'll also show you how a system can pay for itself in the first month.

[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.100]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:08.841]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:10.702]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.123]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.844 --> 00:08:14.364]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:18.306]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:22.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:33.431]  Alright, second segment well into this transmission against tyranny on this Friday edition.
[00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:38.732]  The 6th day of October, 2006.
[00:08:40.732 --> 00:08:44.513]  Alright, here's what's coming up today.
[00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:51.055]  In about 20 minutes I'm going to air a lengthy diatribe, a historical rant.
[00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:55.756]  I wouldn't call it a rant though, it's so well stated and so focused.
[00:08:56.463 --> 00:09:01.728]  By Keith Oberman, who is genuine in his disgust.
[00:09:01.768 --> 00:09:03.750]  You really cannot fake this body language.
[00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.091]  You cannot fake his delivery.
[00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.133]  This is the real McCoy.
[00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:15.620]  Though there are a few problems with his historic rant, but it's amazing.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.686]  You know, they have that film, which is pretty well done, about what happened with
[00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:33.316]  CBS Television and Edward R. Murrow back during McCarthy's activities, which if you listen to this broadcast you know history, you know it's more complex.
[00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:51.060]  than what McCarthy was saying or what Edward R. Murrow was saying, but Edward R. Murrow has been billed as having incredible courage in the face of a blacklist and being, and then later being basically fired and under incredible pressure when the secret police were out in force.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:10:00.989]  He stood up boldly against the Vice President Nixon and the evil bulldog Joe McCarthy.
[00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:13.107]  Well, I've actually watched a lot of those famous broadcasts of Edward R. Murrow and his famous parting line each evening, good night and good luck.
[00:10:14.787 --> 00:10:23.531]  And his, quote, courage is not one one millionth of what Keith Olbermann has been doing every single week.
[00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:28.874]  I mean, at least one broadcast a week, he just lets fly havoc and releases the dogs of war.
[00:10:33.359 --> 00:10:35.319]  I believe I just butchered Shakespeare, but so what?
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.161]  And it's amazing, to say the least.
[00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:49.483]  We will be airing that audio coming up in, what to be exact, 23 minutes from now, about 34 after or so.
[00:10:50.143 --> 00:10:55.965]  I will play the entire 10 minute clip of what Oberman had to say.
[00:10:56.005 --> 00:10:57.505]  He really spelled it out nicely.
[00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:00.521]  And then I'll critique it.
[00:11:01.222 --> 00:11:03.802]  There's two problems in the speech.
[00:11:05.023 --> 00:11:06.523]  And I think Oberman is so smart.
[00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:09.324]  I know people that actually worked with him in broadcast in LA.
[00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:13.265]  And they say he's very smart and was very informed 15 years ago.
[00:11:13.285 --> 00:11:16.726]  10 years ago, back when he worked for ESPN.
[00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:21.047]  Talked to folks that knew him 5 years ago when he first went over to MSNBC.
[00:11:22.527 --> 00:11:28.489]  But there's no mistaking the reason he's got the highest ratings on that pathetic channel.
[00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:30.829]  Because people want the truth.
[00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:32.990]  They don't want fake liberal.
[00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.290]  They don't want fake conservative.
[00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.071]  If you look at all the fake liberal sites, they're plunging in viewership.
[00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:42.331]  If you look at all the fake conservative sites, they're sadly plunging.
[00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:47.072]  I mean, I remember sites like WorldNetDaily and Newsmax that used to do a pretty good job.
[00:11:47.112 --> 00:11:53.374]  Now they've just wedded themselves to neoconism and they're shadows of what they formerly were.
[00:11:53.394 --> 00:11:55.414]  I mean, we're preparing to eclipse them.
[00:11:56.428 --> 00:12:11.174]  In fact, we have eclipsed some of our sites altogether in the, added altogether in the aggregate, but it's actually sad to see people, they just can't help it, even at their own basic dismantlement and implosion.
[00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:17.557]  Those that tell the truth rise, now in the new media age.
[00:12:18.057 --> 00:12:23.560]  Those that abscond and fabricate and feet-drag
[00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:27.903]  I mean, Newsmax still does some good stuff, so does WorldNet Daily.
[00:12:27.963 --> 00:12:28.684]  Again, I like them.
[00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:29.364]  I liked them.
[00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:38.770]  I felt wedded to them in the past, but they've become so wedded to their new... I mean, people see right through trying to puff up Bush and calling him a conservative.
[00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:45.174]  They see right through trying to puff up... This administration is good, guys.
[00:12:45.234 --> 00:12:47.556]  I mean, literally, they are the death of us.
[00:12:48.473 --> 00:12:55.758]  They quite certainly have already killed the Bill of Rights and the Republic and may start physically arresting people and killing us en masse.
[00:12:55.798 --> 00:12:57.279]  I mean, they're openly saying they plan it.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.882]  We have entered the ninth circle of hell for this Republic.
[00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:03.563]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:08.647]  I'm waxing poetic and I need to stop it.
[00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:11.509]  Here's what's coming up today.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:20.683]  We've got the fellow in front of his seven-year-old son who was snatched under orders of Lord Cheney for simply saying your war, or the war, is reprehensible.
[00:13:21.303 --> 00:13:41.390]  And I've got several big national news stories chronicling the scores of people that have been arrested for yelling at, or even speaking to, Emperor Bush, Emperor Cheney, Vice-Emperor Rumsfeld, Viceroy Rice, or any of their other pomps, pimps, minions, servants, lower demons,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:52.325]  Principalities, Generals, Dark Generals, Wing Wraiths, Servants, Baphomets, whatever you want to call them.
[00:13:53.366 --> 00:14:05.533]  Bush, signings called, effort to expand power, not just the news of the constitutional scholars, but now the Congress's scholars themselves have said, yeah, it's dictatorship.
[00:14:08.135 --> 00:14:11.577]  So we'll go over that new report here out of the Boston Globe.
[00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:19.733]  Also, Britain's Observer claims threats by Washington prompted Heathrow terror raids.
[00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:40.665]  Well, 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister for public school-raised folks, there in London, the Prime Minister's office has admitted that the warning came from the White House and the Office of Special Plans of the Pentagon, the foreign office that runs our country.
[00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:59.120]  And that they were told to issue this alert, but now we learn it was threats and coercion, and you notice that the reports of the liquid bombs and how they had all this proof, that has disappeared like vapors in the first light of day.
[00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:02.082]  Like frog in the morn.
[00:15:02.782 --> 00:15:03.623]  It is gone.
[00:15:03.643 --> 00:15:08.205]  It is admitted to be a fraud, totally made up, but again, back of the paper, buried on 24A
[00:15:10.589 --> 00:15:18.691]  Never to be read, never to be known, just like the fake Al-Qaeda videos, just like the fake killings of Zarqawi over and over again, just like all of it.
[00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:28.053]  It doesn't matter, it's the big national news for a day or two, and then back of the paper a month later, a week later, a year later, totally retracted like everything else.
[00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:40.176]  The sarin threats, the botulism threats, the riots and threats, all of them staged, all of them propaganda, but the piggy-eyed general public
[00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:55.925]  Some of them, at least, will still argue with you on the street corner saying they, bleating out, quacking, that Big Brother found WMDs, that Big Brother found Ryerson, that Big Brother found mobile Anthrax trucks, that Big Brother found bioweapons labs at bakeries.
[00:15:57.326 --> 00:15:58.086]  None of it's true!
[00:15:58.287 --> 00:15:59.027]  All retracted!
[00:15:59.247 --> 00:15:59.867]  All lies!
[00:16:00.028 --> 00:16:00.888]  All psyops!
[00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:07.552]  But they know we have a mesmerized public that's into themselves, into entertainment, totally unhappy!
[00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:08.933]  Because when you're totally into entertainment,
[00:16:09.642 --> 00:16:10.783]  Life's about balance, folks.
[00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:18.128]  When you're totally into yourself, you end up totally unhappy, because that is not what life is about.
[00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:37.121]  Sure, it's about pleasure, it's about ball games, it's about pizza, it's probably even about tall glasses of beer, of spottins, but if that becomes the main focus of your life, if that's what you orbit around, if that's your center,
[00:16:37.854 --> 00:16:39.595]  You are going to be totally unhappy.
[00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:44.797]  It's just basic psychology, it's been proven out, the hierarchy of needs.
[00:16:46.458 --> 00:17:00.485]  But nevertheless, people who are into nothing but pleasure, pleasuring themselves at their base animal centers, still think that if they just ingratiate themselves more and become even more decadent and self-centered, that that's the answer, that that will fix it all.
[00:17:02.506 --> 00:17:06.008]  My life is so full, my life is so dynamic, my life is so
[00:17:08.285 --> 00:17:10.946]  That I'm kind of at the danger of the other end of the spectrum.
[00:17:12.387 --> 00:17:25.772]  Where I do too much work, all work no play, makes Jack a, not a dull boy, but let's just say a crabby, crabby boy.
[00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:34.356]  Alright, so we'll get into that, and we'll also get into existence of Al-Qaeda is crap, quite literally.
[00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:44.201]  Did someone really choose to name his terror network after potty humor, or was it a computer database he used to chat with his CIA handlers?
[00:17:44.701 --> 00:17:49.402]  Another huge report by Paul Watson, codenamed Watty Watt.
[00:17:50.442 --> 00:17:54.263]  Also, panel approves subpoenas in Page Scandal.
[00:17:55.863 --> 00:17:59.864]  Hastert, now, I kept saying it was two years ago, now it turns out he knew six years ago.
[00:17:59.884 --> 00:18:03.925]  And let me just in the minute or so, I've got, get into the spin they're using.
[00:18:04.205 --> 00:18:05.045]  I have the quotes here.
[00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:09.710]  Limbaugh says it's the Page's fault, and they were homophobes.
[00:18:10.391 --> 00:18:14.194]  Now Limbaugh's the liberal, which he really actually always has been, but now he's showing us.
[00:18:14.214 --> 00:18:17.317]  Because that's a liberal spin.
[00:18:17.857 --> 00:18:21.320]  It's in his paradigm, it is.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.301]  Of course, it's all false.
[00:18:23.042 --> 00:18:31.769]  The evil Pages were evil right-wingers making fun of gays, and so they sent the instant messages to Foley,
[00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:35.970]  Making fun of the poor, gay American.
[00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:43.412]  And conservative, neocon, brainwashed followers are now very angry about this new homophobia they're calling in.
[00:18:43.952 --> 00:18:44.992]  Very upset right now.
[00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.973]  And Drudge is saying the same thing.
[00:18:50.673 --> 00:19:00.456]  I don't know if it's true and it's his business if he is, but some of, well, one of the former American Spectator writers, who'd been posing as conservative, you know, came out of the closet, went public,
[00:19:01.354 --> 00:19:09.659]  A lot of the top Republicans are homosexuals a few years ago said that well I'm just you just type in is Matt Grudge gay into Google.
[00:19:09.719 --> 00:19:11.540]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:20.305]  But the point is he lives in Palm Beach and is in that scene and he's defending Foley right now saying the exact same talking point.
[00:19:20.365 --> 00:19:21.546]  It's all the page's fault.
[00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:22.506]  It's all made up.
[00:19:23.327 --> 00:19:29.971]  And they're engaging in some smoke and mirrors because out of the hundreds of emails and instant messages one of the people is 18.
[00:19:33.223 --> 00:19:39.649]  And then another one is saying it was a prank, and Drudge has to say, well that doesn't mean all the instrumentals are pranks, but this one is.
[00:19:40.249 --> 00:19:56.663]  So then they spin it and say it's all a prank, and by the time they're done with it, Foley will be a lumberjack who, you know, is dating the young 21-year-old beautiful woman Lassie at the pub.
[00:19:57.524 --> 00:19:58.785]  He's a man's man!
[00:19:58.805 --> 00:19:59.846]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:08.352]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:11.275]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:12.055 --> 00:20:20.482]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:21.443 --> 00:20:26.307]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:26.966 --> 00:20:36.975]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:37.455 --> 00:20:39.757]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:40.538 --> 00:20:41.779]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:41.839]  702-953-0267.
[00:20:50.524 --> 00:20:54.189]  Or visit www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:56.692]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:09.280]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:17.522]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:17.863 --> 00:21:25.705]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:26.025 --> 00:21:30.786]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:31.126 --> 00:21:35.827]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:36.347 --> 00:21:40.208]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:40.688 --> 00:21:41.708]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:41.788 --> 00:21:45.869]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:46.289 --> 00:21:50.670]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.691]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:54.171 --> 00:21:56.293]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.434 --> 00:21:59.857]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.481 --> 00:22:07.044]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[00:22:07.245 --> 00:22:13.091]  The water east of the Continental Divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:17.295]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost a thousand miles to reach the Pacific.
[00:22:20.992 --> 00:22:25.335]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:29.499]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply and naturally.
[00:22:29.659 --> 00:22:33.302]  At the heart of these portable systems are the black Berkey purification elements.
[00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:38.987]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yeast.
[00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:41.609]  Yeah, they can purify that downward flowing water.
[00:22:41.749 --> 00:22:48.693]  Berkey purification systems get rid of the unhealthy stuff in your water while leaving the healthy beneficial materials that your body needs.
[00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:52.256]  For more information on the powerful Berkey purifiers, call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.276 --> 00:22:54.577]  Call today, that's 888-803-4438, or visit us on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:05.298]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:07.780]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.926]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:23:15.506 --> 00:23:17.808]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:23:18.468 --> 00:23:22.011]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:26.695]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:23:27.276 --> 00:23:30.218]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:34.143]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:40.606]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:43.947]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:44.188 --> 00:23:47.609]  For the following two free reports.
[00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:48.770]  U.S.
[00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.751]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:55.053]  Call 888-XANADU.
[00:23:55.093 --> 00:23:59.275]  That's 888-XANADU.
[00:23:59.615 --> 00:24:00.576]  And ask for George.
[00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:26.196]  We've got Stephen Howard coming up in the next hour to talk about being arrested by Lord Cheney's henchman, his Praetorian Imperial Guard.
[00:24:27.836 --> 00:24:30.257]  It turns out this has happened to a whole bunch of people.
[00:24:31.118 --> 00:24:33.219]  Well, it happened to me back when Lord Bush was governor.
[00:24:33.719 --> 00:24:34.899]  It was the end of his speech.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.600]  Everybody was clapping.
[00:24:37.688 --> 00:24:43.672]  I knew because he'd been giving the same speech everywhere, and they'd even posted his speech on the Governor's site, and they were supposed to have a press conference.
[00:24:43.692 --> 00:24:44.453]  They'd cancelled it.
[00:24:45.474 --> 00:24:47.555]  They'd said, no press conference after the speech.
[00:24:48.396 --> 00:24:51.098]  So I just said, Governor, what about the Council on Foreign Relations?
[00:24:51.118 --> 00:24:52.759]  What about the Federal Reserve?
[00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:55.000]  What's destroying this country, Governor?
[00:24:56.281 --> 00:25:03.807]  And boy, he nodded and pointed at me, and directed them at me, and they almost put my fist all the way up to my neck.
[00:25:03.927 --> 00:25:05.708]  I still have shoulder pain from it.
[00:25:06.494 --> 00:25:08.275]  And they took me out and said, you're going to prison!
[00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:09.136]  You're going to jail!
[00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:17.701]  And they drove me around for an hour and threw me out on the side of the highway at the Williamson County-Travis County line.
[00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:19.882]  Went and dumped me off there on the side of the road.
[00:25:20.923 --> 00:25:24.225]  Luckily near the KJFK offices at the time.
[00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:27.067]  Speaking of radio, just a few program notes here.
[00:25:27.507 --> 00:25:29.268]  I'll be here Sunday.
[00:25:29.328 --> 00:25:30.248]  I hope you'll join me.
[00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:33.310]  I'm working on Sundays to warn the people, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:25:35.317 --> 00:25:37.319]  And we tested it last weekend.
[00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:40.061]  This weekend will be the first week that it's truly syndicated.
[00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:42.363]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:25:42.504 --> 00:25:42.904]  Central.
[00:25:42.924 --> 00:25:43.945]  5 to 7 p.m.
[00:25:44.065 --> 00:25:44.505]  Eastern.
[00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.547]  That'll be 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:25:47.188 --> 00:25:47.708]  Mountain.
[00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:49.610]  2 to 4 p.m.
[00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.430]  Pacific.
[00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.354]  Your stations are welcome and I invite you to pick it up.
[00:25:55.715 --> 00:25:56.976]  To tune into the Star Guide.
[00:25:57.236 --> 00:25:59.619]  The feeds are posted at GCNlive.com.
[00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:11.863]  And then you can just contact the network, sign one little form, say you're an affiliate, agree to carry a certain amount of commercials, but why don't you go ahead and just aim the bird at it and just go ahead and get it tuned in.
[00:26:14.284 --> 00:26:16.304]  Or get in touch with the Genesys folks.
[00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:17.525]  In fact, you can call Ted Anderson.
[00:26:17.565 --> 00:26:18.585]  He can send you the form.
[00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:20.565]  It's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:26:20.605 --> 00:26:22.326]  Again, that's all posted at GCN Live.
[00:26:29.473 --> 00:26:31.574]  Here I am doing affiliate relations on the air.
[00:26:33.876 --> 00:26:36.297]  And this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:37.278]  it's a hot show.
[00:26:37.858 --> 00:26:39.860]  High energy, a lot of calls, a lot of news.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.001]  We have quite a few guests on as well.
[00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:42.742]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:26:42.782 --> 00:26:45.944]  you want a hot Sunday program fighting the new world order.
[00:26:45.964 --> 00:26:47.545]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:51.368]  or you can always record it live and air it whenever you like Sunday night.
[00:26:52.688 --> 00:26:56.011]  That is coming up and for Texas listeners you can listen to KLBJ
[00:26:57.017 --> 00:27:11.126]  From all the way, depending on the atmosphere, but you can always hear it in Dallas, but sometimes from Southern Oklahoma all the way down past San Antonio, down to Corpus Christi, down to Houston, Texas, 590 KLBJ.
[00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:15.069]  Our first affiliate coming out of their studios for that Sunday show.
[00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:19.592]  And more, a lot of affiliates have called, excited to be picking it up.
[00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:24.435]  And so I hope to have a list of some of the stations already picking it up this Sunday.
[00:27:25.155 --> 00:27:26.436]  Perhaps some folks at the network.
[00:27:27.822 --> 00:27:32.564]  Mo or Chris can run in here.
[00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:33.885]  I like to say scurry.
[00:27:34.465 --> 00:27:35.425]  It's a diminutive term.
[00:27:35.465 --> 00:27:36.166]  I don't mean it meanly.
[00:27:36.726 --> 00:27:41.608]  Scurry in here and tell me what stations have signed on to it.
[00:27:42.408 --> 00:27:43.749]  What is going on there?
[00:27:45.069 --> 00:27:45.790]  I would like to know.
[00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:54.273]  The live test this weekend will be sent out and then next week it officially will be there for you to pick it up.
[00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:55.614]  So I'm excited about that.
[00:27:56.889 --> 00:28:02.453]  In the last minute and a half of this segment, we'll come back and play the overman clip and get into all the news, and boys, there are a lot of it.
[00:28:02.473 --> 00:28:09.478]  I want to just close out my comments about Drudge and Limbaugh.
[00:28:09.518 --> 00:28:15.302]  I mean, it really is shameful to have both of them now pitching that this is gay bashing.
[00:28:15.362 --> 00:28:16.663]  I have Limbaugh's actual words.
[00:28:17.103 --> 00:28:20.585]  This is just evil gay bashing by really right-wing hateful people.
[00:28:21.146 --> 00:28:22.687]  See, Limbaugh's fighting the right-wingers now.
[00:28:23.624 --> 00:28:27.186]  Evil, hateful, young pages who tried to set up Foley.
[00:28:27.726 --> 00:28:29.167]  He's done absolutely nothing wrong.
[00:28:29.927 --> 00:28:35.310]  Yeah, sending admitted messages to 16-year-olds saying things I won't repeat here on air.
[00:28:37.011 --> 00:28:37.991]  And of course, that's nothing.
[00:28:38.031 --> 00:28:45.935]  We've got posted on PrisonPlanet.com, The Washington Times, The Washington Post, all these mainstream articles back in the 70s, 80s, 90s.
[00:28:47.596 --> 00:28:51.458]  With the underage, callboy networks running out of Democrats' houses.
[00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:53.366]  Barney Frank.
[00:28:53.546 --> 00:28:55.427]  And the Republicans didn't go after him.
[00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.247]  The Democrats didn't.
[00:28:56.527 --> 00:28:57.287]  The police didn't.
[00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:59.408]  Because that's the real stuff, folks.
[00:29:00.408 --> 00:29:02.129]  This Foley thing is all very suspicious.
[00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:09.691]  I mean, sure, the guy's a pervert and chasing every underage and of age young man up there on the hill.
[00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:10.971]  It's all sexual harassment.
[00:29:10.991 --> 00:29:13.512]  I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got in trouble for.
[00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:14.712]  And he should have got in trouble.
[00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:15.492]  And he lied about it.
[00:29:15.932 --> 00:29:17.152]  I was there saying it was bad.
[00:29:17.453 --> 00:29:18.773]  But I was saying missile secrets,
[00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:30.000]  And open borders, and traitors, and drug dealers being in the White House, and communist generals, and murders of the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.080]  I mean, we were there!
[00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:33.701]  Again, we go after everybody!
[00:29:34.821 --> 00:29:37.582]  But no, the Republicans and the Democrats aren't going to touch.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:49.651]  The Snuff Films, and the Slave Brothels, and the Dinecore Sex Slave Rings, which are in the Chicago Tribune, but again, it's in the paper, and eh, let's not have a big news cycle.
[00:29:52.254 --> 00:29:53.135]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:55.237]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.158 --> 00:29:58.841]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.963 --> 00:30:06.005]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:30:06.225 --> 00:30:09.626]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:13.248]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:16.782]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:30:16.802 --> 00:30:22.286]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:30:22.306 --> 00:30:31.933]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:30:32.074 --> 00:30:33.355]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:30:33.395 --> 00:30:38.859]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:30:39.238 --> 00:30:43.779]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:45.240]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.221]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:50.141]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:31:01.906 --> 00:31:02.666]  Terrorism!
[00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:03.567]  Terrorism!
[00:31:03.687 --> 00:31:09.750]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.591]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:14.312]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:31:14.712 --> 00:31:29.280]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:29.640]  government.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.601]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:31:31.981 --> 00:31:37.882]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:42.523]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:02.970]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:10.657]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[00:32:10.817 --> 00:32:18.605]  With stabilized allicins, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[00:32:18.805 --> 00:32:19.886]  And there's no odor.
[00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:30.153]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[00:32:30.193 --> 00:32:38.439]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:44.283]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.231]  Thank you.
[00:33:08.317 --> 00:33:12.823]  Okay, so Bush hasn't just declared himself emperor and abolished the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:18.030]  He now has openly, in statements to Congress, saying, I will have signing statements, now almost 900.
[00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:21.182]  It's like 50 every month.
[00:33:21.242 --> 00:33:22.603]  It was just 800 a few months ago.
[00:33:22.663 --> 00:33:27.827]  Now they're saying it's upwards of 900, where he interprets all laws by writing things in the law.
[00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.890]  He's also now signing laws that haven't passed Congress.
[00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.832]  We've entered a vortex, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:35.754]  And neocons all believe this.
[00:33:35.794 --> 00:33:37.315]  They say he has dictatorial power.
[00:33:37.675 --> 00:33:42.059]  Why do we have a legislative and judicial then, if the executive is everything?
[00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:44.601]  A unitary executive, as they call it.
[00:33:45.902 --> 00:33:54.950]  Again, Britain was threatened into issuing the fake terror alerts, but they're still going to take your water and still take your liquids and still jab you and poke you and train you how to be a slave.
[00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.590]  We'll get into that.
[00:33:57.231 --> 00:34:04.878]  Proof that Al-Qaeda was a CIA intranet, private internet back in the 80s that our government helped build for the Saudis.
[00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:07.700]  Again, I have the actual Limbaugh quotes.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.062]  We only got one guest coming on today for 30 minutes.
[00:34:10.122 --> 00:34:11.663]  Later, I should have time to read these quotes.
[00:34:12.184 --> 00:34:14.846]  This is all homophobia against the loving foley.
[00:34:15.752 --> 00:34:18.313]  Now you're being too right-wing out there.
[00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:24.155]  Another one, activists ready to out-gay GOP Senator, another big scandal brewing.
[00:34:24.515 --> 00:34:30.256]  House GOP leaders ask for probe into alleged Foley dorm visit, and now subpoenas are being issued.
[00:34:32.357 --> 00:34:36.098]  Also, Cheney is arrogantly saying GOP will retain control.
[00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:39.379]  See, it didn't matter if the polls were all showing that
[00:34:42.357 --> 00:34:47.821]  That Bush's cousin and fraternity mate, secret society mate, John Kerry, was going to win.
[00:34:49.182 --> 00:34:53.485]  Because the neocons stole the election in Ohio, New Mexico, all over the place.
[00:34:54.105 --> 00:34:57.107]  Places where they were ten points ahead in the polls, they lost.
[00:34:58.168 --> 00:34:59.509]  And it was clear election fraud.
[00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:01.390]  Again, I'm not saying John Kerry's good.
[00:35:01.969 --> 00:35:04.190]  You see, they couldn't just stage the election and steal it.
[00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.352]  They had to have a staged candidate who would then take the dive.
[00:35:07.652 --> 00:35:11.754]  Because real people were going to go vote for Kerry thinking he was a real candidate.
[00:35:11.994 --> 00:35:17.397]  So notice he just disappeared, didn't say a word, totally gave up, promised he'd do a bunch of stuff to fight it and didn't.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:19.698]  It's called taking a dive.
[00:35:21.299 --> 00:35:24.521]  So, it's staged at the higher levels and the lower levels.
[00:35:25.661 --> 00:35:27.663]  And Cheney's saying, hey, we're going to win, no problem.
[00:35:27.823 --> 00:35:30.305]  Just like he said, hey, ignore it, we're going to win, no problem.
[00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:41.634]  The question is, do they have enough of the CIA-controlled, Diebold, Hardener Civic, and Sequoia machines in 35% of the country to be able to leverage and still steal it?
[00:35:42.035 --> 00:35:49.541]  If there's a huge landslide against Lord Bush for Independents and Democrats, they may not be able to.
[00:35:52.549 --> 00:35:55.310]  And again, will November bring hope or another stolen election?
[00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:00.113]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a real conservative, great editorial there I want to go through if we have time.
[00:36:02.254 --> 00:36:05.215]  This is just some of what's coming up today.
[00:36:06.996 --> 00:36:13.039]  But before we do that and before we go to Terry and Michael and Chris and Keith and everybody else,
[00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:16.171]  That is patiently holding.
[00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:18.954]  Let's go to Keith Oberman from last night.
[00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:21.576]  You can watch the video after the show if you like it.
[00:36:22.037 --> 00:36:22.798]  Or whenever you like it.
[00:36:22.838 --> 00:36:30.325]  PrisonPlanet.com if you want to get the facial expressions and more of his body language inflections.
[00:36:30.945 --> 00:36:33.988]  But this is really historical.
[00:36:34.068 --> 00:36:37.912]  I mean this makes Edward R. Murrow look like a complete wimp.
[00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:43.773]  And Edward R. Murrow wasn't really challenging the establishment.
[00:36:43.833 --> 00:36:44.473]  He thought he was.
[00:36:44.513 --> 00:36:45.134]  He had courage.
[00:36:45.374 --> 00:36:50.076]  He was only challenging one small area of the false paradigm.
[00:36:50.596 --> 00:36:54.378]  Oberman is going further than anyone I've ever seen on television.
[00:36:55.999 --> 00:37:04.562]  Challenging boldly and for real, in an official capacity, what's happening.
[00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:05.923]  Obviously I'll critique it now.
[00:37:07.361 --> 00:37:10.123]  He keeps talking about basically how the Democrats are the good guys.
[00:37:10.744 --> 00:37:12.505]  And he's still caught in the left-right paradigm.
[00:37:13.286 --> 00:37:15.788]  And really, with a rising dictator, they are.
[00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:20.352]  Because even Ron Paul has said that it would be good to have a separation of powers.
[00:37:21.303 --> 00:37:31.031]  Here on the show, and boy, what he said got a lot of attention, he got a lot of heat over that, but he was honest that Bush needs to lose control because the founding fathers said we need a separation of powers.
[00:37:31.071 --> 00:37:42.920]  I mean, he's saying he's above the Congress, he's above the courts, he's above everything, he'll do whatever he wants, he'll sign laws that haven't passed, he'll nix laws he wants to, he doesn't have that line-item veto, but he executes it.
[00:37:45.339 --> 00:37:50.542]  And so we need, whether it's the Constitution Party, that'd be great, the Libertarians would be great, it's not going to be them.
[00:37:50.862 --> 00:37:57.166]  And sure, the Democrats are pretty darn evil and pretty bad in our establishment, but at least the Founding Fathers knew that.
[00:37:58.801 --> 00:38:04.783]  They wanted to pit different corrupt groups against each other so you wouldn't get centralization and a dictatorship.
[00:38:05.224 --> 00:38:10.606]  Let government be separated and let power-hungry people fight with each other to keep the government off our back.
[00:38:10.946 --> 00:38:16.728]  It was a genius system because government always becomes evil, always you get tyranny, always you get enslaved.
[00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:17.588]  Did you know that?
[00:38:18.188 --> 00:38:18.608]  In history?
[00:38:19.008 --> 00:38:20.249]  And so they set up a system
[00:38:21.227 --> 00:38:27.910]  Basically, where you pit the establishment against each other with thousands of different fissures.
[00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:30.852]  The legislatures in the states with two different houses.
[00:38:31.845 --> 00:38:35.308]  With a governor pitted against a lieutenant governor.
[00:38:35.689 --> 00:38:38.191]  With the states and regions pitted against each other.
[00:38:38.872 --> 00:38:43.556]  With the legislative and the executive and the judicial of the states fighting with each other.
[00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:46.899]  Fighting with the federal judiciary and executive and legislative.
[00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:51.263]  And then the separation with hundreds of members in the House and a hundred members in the Senate.
[00:38:51.803 --> 00:38:52.644]  And then you've got
[00:38:53.786 --> 00:39:08.653]  The executive, and the state courts, and the federal courts, and the counties, and the cities, and look at how then 4% of the population got half the wealth of the world and 90 plus percent of the inventions, milk and honey, gushing through the streets.
[00:39:10.487 --> 00:39:13.668]  Now it's all going, it's all leaving because of centralization.
[00:39:14.068 --> 00:39:19.470]  Centralizers will destroy economies just so no one can rival them and so there's no competition.
[00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:28.953]  It's like a lion going into the pride, a male lion, and killing babies after the female gives birth to them.
[00:39:29.273 --> 00:39:31.453]  Going in and smelling them and eating the males.
[00:39:31.833 --> 00:39:33.834]  Killing the males, the females having to fight them off.
[00:39:34.194 --> 00:39:35.494]  Grizzly bears do that too.
[00:39:35.815 --> 00:39:37.155]  Many species of fish do that.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.381]  Many species of bird do that.
[00:39:40.821 --> 00:39:41.722]  Well, it's just the same thing.
[00:39:41.762 --> 00:39:45.145]  The elite come in and literally knock down economies.
[00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:47.046]  That's what you've got to understand, folks.
[00:39:47.606 --> 00:39:49.008]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the Oberman clip.
[00:39:49.128 --> 00:39:53.291]  The other thing is, he acts like Tommy Franks is being good.
[00:39:53.351 --> 00:40:02.177]  What Oberman probably doesn't know, what he missed in the congressional reports, is that illegally, Tommy Franks was pulling $455,000 a year.
[00:40:02.197 --> 00:40:02.878]  For the first two years, he
[00:40:08.394 --> 00:40:28.486]  He retired, and then he got caught, and supposedly he then didn't get the funds to go on TV and say, I'm non-partisan, I'm not with the Republicans or the Democrats, but I think Bush is doing a great job when he can attack Iran and keep going in Iraq, and by the way, it's real sad to say, but after the next attack, we're gonna, the people are gonna demand martial law and a military government.
[00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:30.687]  He can't come out and say, we need it.
[00:40:30.727 --> 00:40:35.290]  They come out and say, just like Ridge said, it's real sad, but it's gonna have to happen.
[00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.811]  See, Oberman's acting like
[00:40:38.067 --> 00:40:45.712]  Franks is on the payroll saying that, breaking the ice, introducing the idea, as they all were, off script.
[00:40:46.073 --> 00:40:48.934]  So Oberman's wrong about that too, but still, incredible!
[00:40:49.555 --> 00:40:51.896]  I can't believe what you're about to hear.
[00:40:51.957 --> 00:40:52.557]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.531]  And lastly tonight, a special comment about lying.
[00:40:57.072 --> 00:41:18.682]  While the leadership in Congress has self-destructed over the revelations of an unmatched and unrelieved march through a cesspool, while the leadership inside the White House has self-destructed over the revelations of a book with a glowing red cover, the President of the United States, unbowed, undeterred, and unconnected to reality, has continued his extraordinary trek through our country, rooting out the enemies of freedom, the Democrats.
[00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:30.128]  Yesterday, at a fundraiser for an Arizona congressman, Mr. Bush claimed, quote, 177 of the opposition party said, you know, we don't think we ought to be listening to the conversations of terrorists.
[00:41:31.169 --> 00:41:32.649]  The hell they did.
[00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.112]  177 Democrats opposed the President's seizure of yet another part of the Constitution.
[00:41:37.632 --> 00:41:44.795]  Not even the White House press office could actually name a single Democrat who had ever said the government shouldn't be listening to the conversation of terrorists.
[00:41:45.456 --> 00:41:47.877]  President Bush hears what he wants.
[00:41:48.917 --> 00:41:55.061]  Tuesday, at another fundraiser in California, he had said that Democrats take a law enforcement approach to terrorism.
[00:41:55.362 --> 00:41:59.465]  That means America will wait until we're attacked again before we respond.
[00:42:00.285 --> 00:42:05.249]  Mr. Bush fabricated that, too, and evidently he has begun to fancy himself as a mind reader.
[00:42:05.809 --> 00:42:16.657]  If you listen closely to some of the leaders of the Democratic Party, the president said at yet another fundraiser Monday in Nevada, it sounds like they think the best way to protect the American people is wait until we're attacked again.
[00:42:17.685 --> 00:42:19.966]  The president does not just hear what he wants.
[00:42:20.346 --> 00:42:22.627]  He hears things that only he can hear.
[00:42:23.387 --> 00:42:30.730]  It defies belief that this president and his administration could continue to find new, unexplored political gutters into which they can wallow.
[00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:31.711]  Yet they do.
[00:42:32.555 --> 00:42:38.019]  It is startling enough that such things could be said out loud by any president at any time in this nation's history.
[00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:47.585]  Rhetorically, this is about an inch short of Mr. Bush accusing Democratic leaders, Democrats, the majority of Americans who disagree with his policies, of treason.
[00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:51.108]  But it is the context that truly makes the heads spin.
[00:42:51.863 --> 00:43:03.540]  Just 25 days ago, on the fifth anniversary of the 9-11 attacks, this same man spoke to this nation and insisted, quote, we must put aside our differences and work together to meet the test that history has given us.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.302]  Mr. Bush, this is a test you have already failed.
[00:43:07.963 --> 00:43:25.918]  If your commitment to put aside differences and work together is replaced in the span of merely three weeks by claiming your political opponents prefer to wait to see this country attacked again and by spewing fabrications about what they have said, then the questions your critics need to be asking are no longer about your policies.
[00:43:26.358 --> 00:43:33.184]  They are instead solemn and even terrible questions about your fitness to fulfill the responsibilities of your office.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:41.504]  No Democrat, sir, has ever said anything approaching the suggestion that the best means of self-defense is to wait until we're attacked again.
[00:43:42.045 --> 00:44:00.755]  No critic, no commentator, no reluctant Republican in the Senate has ever said anything that any responsible person could even have exaggerated into the slander you spoke in Nevada on Monday night, nor the slander you spoke in California on Tuesday, nor the slander you spoke in Arizona on Wednesday, nor whatever is next.
[00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.212]  We have, of course, survived all manner of political hackery.
[00:44:04.252 --> 00:44:08.955]  Of every shape, size, and party, we will have to suffer it for as long as the Republic stands.
[00:44:09.555 --> 00:44:15.019]  But the premise of a president who comes across as a compulsive liar is nothing less than terrifying.
[00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:23.004]  A president who, since 9-11, will not listen, is not listening, and, thanks to Bob Woodward's most recent account, evidently has never listened.
[00:44:23.524 --> 00:44:31.029]  A president who, since 9-11, so hates or fears other Americans that he accuses them of advocating deliberate inaction in the face of the enemy.
[00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:37.014]  A president who, since 9-11, has savaged the very freedoms he claims to be protecting from attack.
[00:44:37.534 --> 00:44:39.434]  Attack by terrorists?
[00:44:39.994 --> 00:44:41.075]  Or by Democrats?
[00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:42.395]  Or by both?
[00:44:43.115 --> 00:44:48.297]  It's now impossible to find a consistent thread of logic as to who Mr. Bush believes the enemy truly is.
[00:44:49.505 --> 00:44:52.889]  But if we know one thing for certain about President Bush, it is this.
[00:44:53.470 --> 00:45:08.828]  This President, in his bullying of the Senate last month, in his slandering of the Democrats this month, has shown us that he believes whoever the enemies actually are, they are hiding themselves inside a dangerous cloak called the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:45:10.788 --> 00:45:14.390]  How often do we find priceless truth in the unlikeliest of places?
[00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:20.374]  I tonight quote not Jefferson nor Voltaire, but Cigar Aficionado Magazine.
[00:45:21.015 --> 00:45:30.341]  On September 11, 2003, the editor of that publication interviewed General Tommy Franks, at that point just retired from his post as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S.
[00:45:30.381 --> 00:45:31.682]  Central Command of CENTCOM.
[00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:43.326]  And amid his quaint defenses of the then-nagging absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the continuing freedom of Osama bin Laden, General Franks said some of the most profound words of this generation.
[00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:46.688]  He spoke of the worst thing that can happen to this country.
[00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:51.413]  First, quoting, a massive, casually producing event somewhere in the Western world.
[00:45:51.473 --> 00:45:53.034]  It may be in the United States of America.
[00:45:53.607 --> 00:46:04.169]  Then the general continued, the western world, the free world, loses what it cherishes most and that is freedom and liberty we've seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy.
[00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:29.496]  It was this super patriotic warrior's fear that we would lose that most cherished liberty because of another attack, one, again quoting General Franks, that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass casualty producing event, which in fact then begins to potentially unravel the fabric of our Constitution.
[00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:31.538]  And here we are,
[00:46:32.324 --> 00:46:36.205]  The fabric of our Constitution being unraveled anyway.
[00:46:36.985 --> 00:46:38.406]  Habeas Corpus neutered.
[00:46:38.786 --> 00:46:42.327]  The rights of self-defense now as malleable and impermanent as clay.
[00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:49.009]  A president stifling all critics by every means available and when he runs out of those by simply lying about what they said or felt.
[00:46:50.429 --> 00:46:52.190]  And all this even without the dreaded attack.
[00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:59.032]  General Franks, like all of us, loves this country and believes not just in its values but in its continuity.
[00:46:59.645 --> 00:47:02.948]  He has been trained to look for threats to that continuity from without.
[00:47:03.768 --> 00:47:10.994]  He has, perhaps, been as naive as the rest of us in failing to keep close enough vigil on the threats to that continuity from within.
[00:47:12.055 --> 00:47:18.600]  Secretary of State Rice first cannot remember urgent cautionary meetings with counter-terrorism officials before 9-11.
[00:47:19.141 --> 00:47:23.244]  Then, within hours of that lie, her spokesman confirms the meetings in question.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:30.666]  Then she dismisses those meetings as nothing new, yet insists she wanted the same cautions expressed to Secretaries Ashcroft and Rumsfeld.
[00:47:31.367 --> 00:47:37.632]  Mr. Rumsfeld, meantime, has been unable to accept the most logical and simple influence of the most noble and neutral of advisors.
[00:47:38.173 --> 00:47:48.342]  He and his employer insist they rely on the generals in the field, but dozens of those generals have now come forward to say how their words, their experiences, have been ignored.
[00:47:49.122 --> 00:47:54.446]  And, of course, inherent in the Pentagon's war-making functions is the regulation of presidential war lust.
[00:47:55.026 --> 00:48:01.171]  Enacting that regulation should include everything up to symbolically wrestling the chief executive to the floor, if necessary.
[00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:15.561]  Yet, and it is Pentagon transcripts that now tell us this, evidently Mr. Rumsfeld's strongest check on Mr. Bush's ambitions was to get someone to excise the phrase, mission accomplished, out of the infamous Air Force carrier speech of May 1st, 2003.
[00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:21.585]  Even while the same empty words hung on a banner over the President's shoulder.
[00:48:22.605 --> 00:48:23.526]  And the Vice President.
[00:48:24.066 --> 00:48:25.387]  He is a chilling figure.
[00:48:25.827 --> 00:48:30.210]  Still unable, it seems, to accept the conclusions of his own party's leaders in the Senate.
[00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.692]  That the foundations of his public positions are made out of sand.
[00:48:35.393 --> 00:48:37.554]  There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:48:38.214 --> 00:48:39.175]  But he still says so.
[00:48:39.775 --> 00:48:42.857]  There was no link between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:43.697 --> 00:48:44.698]  But he still says so.
[00:48:46.033 --> 00:48:57.759]  And thus gripping firmly these figments of his own imagination, Mr. Cheney lives on, in defiance, and spreads around him and before him darkness, like some contagion of fear.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.101]  They are never wrong and they never regret.
[00:49:02.941 --> 00:49:07.223]  Admirable in a French torch singer, cataclysmic in an American leader.
[00:49:08.129 --> 00:49:16.972]  Thus, the sickening attempt to blame the Foley scandal on the negligence of others or the Clinton era, even though the Foley scandal began before the Lewinsky scandal.
[00:49:17.512 --> 00:49:26.395]  Thus, last month's enraged attacks on this administration's predecessors about Osama bin Laden, a projection of their own negligence in the immediate months before 9-11.
[00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:36.779]  Thus, the terrifying attempt to hamstring the fundament of our freedom, the Constitution, a triumph for Al-Qaeda, one the terrorists could not hope to achieve on their own with a hundred 9-11s.
[00:49:38.118 --> 00:49:47.046]  And thus, worst of all, perhaps, these newest lies by President Bush about Democrats choosing to await another attack and not listen to the conversations of terrorists.
[00:49:48.447 --> 00:49:56.094]  It is the terror and the guilt within your own heart, Mr. Bush, that you redirect at others who simply wish for you to temper your certainty with counsel.
[00:49:56.889 --> 00:50:04.711]  It is the failure and the incompetence within your own memory, Mr. Bush, that leads you to demonize those who might merely quote you the pleadings of Oliver Cromwell.
[00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:10.732]  I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.
[00:50:12.073 --> 00:50:15.634]  It is not the Democrats who's inaction in the face of the enemy you fear, sir.
[00:50:15.774 --> 00:50:21.495]  It is your own, before 9-11, and, and you alone know this, perhaps afterwards.
[00:50:22.344 --> 00:50:26.728]  Mr. President, these new lies go to the heart of what it is that you truly wish to preserve.
[00:50:27.408 --> 00:50:29.930]  It is not our freedom, nor our country.
[00:50:30.551 --> 00:50:33.773]  Your actions against the Constitution give irrefutable proof of that.
[00:50:34.374 --> 00:50:41.279]  You want to preserve one political party's power, and obviously you will sell this country out to do it.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:48.125]  These are lies about the Democrats, pile atop lies about Iraq, pile atop lies about your preparations for Al Qaeda.
[00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:51.355]  To you, perhaps, they feel like the weight of a million centuries.
[00:50:51.835 --> 00:50:52.435]  As crushing.
[00:50:52.736 --> 00:50:53.476]  As immovable.
[00:50:54.097 --> 00:50:54.798]  But they are not.
[00:50:55.378 --> 00:50:59.362]  If you add more lies to them, you cannot free yourself and us from them.
[00:51:05.237 --> 00:51:08.440]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.722]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:11.082 --> 00:51:18.748]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.428 --> 00:51:26.494]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.894 --> 00:51:33.760]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:34.252 --> 00:51:38.294]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.615 --> 00:51:42.097]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.577 --> 00:51:44.498]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.838 --> 00:51:48.741]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:09.108 --> 00:54:11.849]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[00:54:17.213 --> 00:54:18.715]  Alright, I've got a bunch of crawlers here.
[00:54:21.457 --> 00:54:22.958]  And we'll go to you, here in a moment.
[00:54:25.361 --> 00:54:28.123]  That Keith Uberman clip is historical, it's powerful.
[00:54:28.163 --> 00:54:34.109]  We got it off the web and took out the hiss, so then it creates that background boop-boop-boop-boop, you know, computerized digital noise.
[00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:35.710]  And we aired just about all of it.
[00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:36.831]  There was about five seconds left.
[00:54:36.851 --> 00:54:40.815]  You can watch the video of it up on PrisonPlanet.com, as we mentioned earlier.
[00:54:42.685 --> 00:54:51.049]  Please join myself and Keith Oberman and Ron Paul and Lou Dobbs and so many other Americans in having courage.
[00:54:51.149 --> 00:54:54.731]  I mean, believe me, Keith Oberman, myself, many others, we're prominent.
[00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:55.771]  We're out here in the open.
[00:54:55.791 --> 00:54:59.133]  We're out here standing up against the destruction of this country.
[00:54:59.633 --> 00:55:04.755]  And so many of you out there know the truth, but you email me or you tell me on the street you're scared to get involved.
[00:55:05.696 --> 00:55:07.917]  If you've already fallen to fear, it's over.
[00:55:08.097 --> 00:55:08.517]  It's gone.
[00:55:10.012 --> 00:55:14.974]  You understand they are officially setting up a real McCoy dictatorship.
[00:55:15.995 --> 00:55:20.076]  Not just some good old boy or soft tyranny like they have in Canada or England.
[00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:22.337]  I mean a hardcore tyranny.
[00:55:23.938 --> 00:55:30.861]  And Bush has got about 30% of the country that would follow him no matter what he did.
[00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.722]  They're not conservatives, they're not Americans.
[00:55:33.762 --> 00:55:38.164]  They're mind-numbed, meaning well, very dangerous.
[00:55:39.176 --> 00:55:40.658]  Really Nazi type people.
[00:55:40.798 --> 00:55:41.959]  A lot of Nazis meant well.
[00:55:42.299 --> 00:55:43.300]  That they really believed it.
[00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:44.882]  They believed they were doing good.
[00:55:44.902 --> 00:55:46.043]  You have to understand that.
[00:55:46.623 --> 00:55:49.286]  They didn't prance around going, we're the bad guys, we're the bad guys.
[00:55:50.807 --> 00:55:53.370]  Even in their black uniforms festooned with skulls.
[00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:55.352]  They couldn't see the forest for the trees.
[00:55:56.776 --> 00:55:59.700]  And we're here today facing something similar.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:04.166]  And don't think Bush with 30% of the population can't take over and can't run things.
[00:56:04.206 --> 00:56:07.470]  And don't think that 30%, folks, they can be cramming us in ovens.
[00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.411]  And I've met these people.
[00:56:08.451 --> 00:56:10.313]  They will man the ovens.
[00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:11.435]  They will man
[00:56:12.671 --> 00:56:18.294]  We've got to be ready, and I've never called for violence, but we have to be ready to defend ourselves against that 30% and the foreign bankers agent
[00:56:39.746 --> 00:56:40.787]  George Bush's government.
[00:56:40.807 --> 00:56:43.588]  You know, they try to put us in FEMA camps or mass arrest everybody.
[00:56:44.188 --> 00:56:46.589]  We have got to defend ourselves.
[00:56:48.190 --> 00:57:00.116]  And if we do defend ourselves, if we do stand up at least, and not get in the army trucks and not be taken to the super domes and then flown out to the FEMA camps, or bused to the FEMA camps, or railed to them,
[00:57:02.359 --> 00:57:04.002]  Uh, they will back off quite quickly.
[00:57:04.202 --> 00:57:05.064]  I mean, I have no doubt.
[00:57:05.104 --> 00:57:06.206]  They would put people in camps.
[00:57:06.226 --> 00:57:13.839]  They already have 14,000, but they would put most of us in camps and kill millions of us and really do what Bush's grandfather did.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.700]  If they thought they could.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:22.722]  In fact, they admit the Pentagon is using keyword software now to track our resistance to their programs.
[00:57:22.742 --> 00:57:23.882]  That was in AP yesterday.
[00:57:24.202 --> 00:57:25.322]  They're listening to what we do.
[00:57:25.802 --> 00:57:26.762]  They're tracking what we do.
[00:57:27.282 --> 00:57:34.124]  They're openly tracking what our political views are of them militarily.
[00:57:34.504 --> 00:57:35.904]  Totally criminal, totally illegal.
[00:57:37.784 --> 00:57:38.965]  And they know we're getting mad.
[00:57:39.405 --> 00:57:41.225]  They're getting scared right now, and they should be scared.
[00:57:42.453 --> 00:57:48.675]  A lot of us are decadent and evil and corrupt, but there are still some of us that are good and willing to stand up.
[00:57:49.236 --> 00:57:53.857]  And you know that you've gone too far, so you're trying to go even further now in your arrogance.
[00:57:54.397 --> 00:58:00.900]  You believe your arrogance and your hubris will... and I've seen so many arrogant people fall in the past.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:09.843]  They think their arrogance will take them across the gap, and it isn't going to happen.
[00:58:11.619 --> 00:58:14.040]  So, if you cower, America, they will win.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.821]  You're gonna get raped, big time.
[00:58:17.162 --> 00:58:19.443]  And if you fight back, we're gonna get the country back.
[00:58:20.844 --> 00:58:21.404]  It's up to you.
[00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:23.965]  They're actually going for it.
[00:58:24.025 --> 00:58:25.766]  The fall of the Republic is happening.
[00:58:27.047 --> 00:58:38.052]  And, uh... Believe me, they're listening, they're scanning, they're... They're gonna do some tests very soon, and if we falter during those tests, they're gonna ace us.
[00:58:38.853 --> 00:58:39.413]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.062]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:47.102 --> 00:58:47.562]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.582 --> 00:58:48.623]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.663 --> 00:58:50.984]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.425 --> 00:58:56.566]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.574 --> 00:59:05.455]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.115 --> 00:59:10.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.317 --> 00:59:14.399]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:38.532]  Alright, we're going to take a few calls right now, and we've got a guest coming on who dared speak to the Vice Emperor, and so he was arrested.
[00:59:38.572 --> 00:59:41.053]  Just speaking to a god now is a crime.
[00:59:41.093 --> 00:59:44.514]  I mean, that's the 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago.
[00:59:44.534 --> 00:59:48.816]  Yeah, 500 years ago you could actually say something rude to the king.
[00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:56.519]  I guess it was 800, almost 790-something years ago, Magna Carta time, so you could tell the king he was despicable.
[00:59:57.179 --> 01:00:00.240]  But we're now pre-Magna Carta.
[01:00:02.324 --> 01:00:03.485]  I mean, folks, it's gone.
[01:00:03.985 --> 01:00:04.626]  The country's gone.
[01:00:05.086 --> 01:00:20.236]  Now we're trying to resuscitate, and I guess we've got about four minutes to do that before the country completely dies, and I guess in the scheme of four minutes in the time of civilizations, a year less to resuscitate.
[01:00:21.216 --> 01:00:24.218]  I mean, they're moving, and if you think it's just Bush, he's a front man, folks.
[01:00:24.238 --> 01:00:25.359]  The elite's moving against us.
[01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:26.680]  Let's talk to Terry.
[01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:30.270]  In Wisconsin, and Mike, Chris, Keith, and others.
[01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:30.850]  Go ahead, Terry.
[01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:31.890]  Hey, what's happening, man?
[01:00:32.251 --> 01:00:34.851]  This is a nationwide, worldwide radio broadcast.
[01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:35.572]  Alright, man.
[01:00:36.152 --> 01:00:38.133]  Hey, that was an excellent pep talk before the commercial.
[01:00:38.773 --> 01:00:40.173]  We ain't going to no stinking camps.
[01:00:40.193 --> 01:00:40.593]  How about it?
[01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:41.754]  I hear ya.
[01:00:42.114 --> 01:00:46.135]  Hey, man, I was watching a Christian program yesterday, and the guy said, it was J.R.
[01:00:46.155 --> 01:00:54.738]  Church, I don't know if you ever heard of him or not, but he said a warning was issued from Pakistan, you know, advising all Muslims to leave the country and everything.
[01:00:55.191 --> 01:00:58.096]  That a bomb had been smuggled across the border from Mexico.
[01:00:58.772 --> 01:00:59.812]  You ever hear about anything like that?
[01:00:59.852 --> 01:01:03.494]  Yeah, they've got all the neocons out in mega mass.
[01:01:04.034 --> 01:01:06.055]  The new religion is not following Christ.
[01:01:06.515 --> 01:01:08.416]  It's holy war.
[01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:09.997]  It's giving up our freedoms.
[01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:13.898]  The sacrament is loving Bush and all of his pedophile cronies.
[01:01:14.658 --> 01:01:17.039]  And it's just, it's everywhere.
[01:01:17.079 --> 01:01:17.780]  The nuke's here.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.540]  We're all dead.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.780]  But worship Bush.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.741]  The border's wide open.
[01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:21.501]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:25.983]  It's just more fear-mongering, more subconscious fear for the attack on Iran.
[01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:28.471]  So you don't think that's necessarily true then, right?
[01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:30.332]  It's total bull.
[01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:31.092]  Okay.
[01:01:31.832 --> 01:01:32.312]  Well, hey man.
[01:01:33.412 --> 01:01:36.093]  Watching you bullhorn people in other countries and everything is really good.
[01:01:36.653 --> 01:01:38.213]  It's an excellent thing, man.
[01:01:38.793 --> 01:01:40.414]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[01:01:40.434 --> 01:01:40.774]  Pardon me?
[01:01:41.274 --> 01:01:42.594]  It's really getting us pumped up, man.
[01:01:42.934 --> 01:01:43.334]  Good, good.
[01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:44.235]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:44.275 --> 01:01:44.875]  Thank you, Terry.
[01:01:44.915 --> 01:01:45.775]  Good to have you on board.
[01:01:46.595 --> 01:01:47.275]  Who's up next here?
[01:01:49.356 --> 01:01:50.176]  Michael in Florida.
[01:01:50.196 --> 01:01:50.796]  You're on the air.
[01:01:50.856 --> 01:01:51.176]  Welcome.
[01:01:51.836 --> 01:01:52.256]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:52.736]  How you doing?
[01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:53.456]  Good, sir.
[01:01:54.197 --> 01:01:56.077]  I would like to make you and your listeners aware
[01:01:56.676 --> 01:02:00.597]  of a well-known program within Fatherland Security called ADVISE.
[01:02:01.738 --> 01:02:07.199]  It's called Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, and Semantic Enhancement.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:14.922]  Basically, if you remember Total Information Awareness, it is basically the same thing.
[01:02:14.942 --> 01:02:15.942]  They've never gotten rid of it.
[01:02:16.623 --> 01:02:17.963]  It operates out of Virginia.
[01:02:18.603 --> 01:02:20.204]  Look, everything's fed through the hubs.
[01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.844]  It's been like that since the late 90s.
[01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:23.485]  Yes, and
[01:02:24.426 --> 01:02:44.550]  In a 2005 document called Intelligence Information Sharing Initiative Homeland Security Intelligence Information Fusion, they talk about how they will share information between local, state, federal, private sector, and other governmental organizations.
[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.330]  Oh yeah, and again, they've always been doing this.
[01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:51.191]  This legalization of it is just about introducing it to you.
[01:02:51.832 --> 01:02:55.574]  And then Google comes out and says, and we'll use the microphone on your computer to listen to you.
[01:02:56.794 --> 01:03:04.478]  Yes, and actually, the funny thing about it is that not only terrorists will be tracked, but criminals also.
[01:03:04.818 --> 01:03:09.100]  Oh, well it's always terror and crime because all terror is crime and all crime is terror.
[01:03:10.061 --> 01:03:10.821]  Yeah, it says here.
[01:03:11.314 --> 01:03:24.999]  The attacks of September 11, 2001, however, taught us that those wanting to commit acts of terrorism may live in our local communities and be engaged in criminal and or other suspicious activity.
[01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:33.202]  Well, it's like AP two days ago was, we think Al-Qaeda may work with the Mafia.
[01:03:33.262 --> 01:03:36.143]  No evidence of it, but now the Mafia is Al-Qaeda.
[01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.271]  Do me a favor.
[01:03:38.351 --> 01:03:39.832]  Email that to Paul Watson.
[01:03:39.872 --> 01:03:41.713]  Email it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:42.053 --> 01:03:45.775]  We need to do a story about how total information awareness never went away.
[01:03:46.516 --> 01:03:47.416]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:49.397]  We've got a big guest coming up and more of your calls.
[01:03:49.417 --> 01:03:49.817]  Stay with us.
[01:03:57.049 --> 01:04:00.230]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:02.510]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:10.532]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:18.253]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:25.515]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:26.044 --> 01:04:30.127]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.387 --> 01:04:33.890]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.292]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.612 --> 01:04:40.535]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.601 --> 01:04:58.684]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:06.068]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:16.833]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:05:17.054 --> 01:05:21.576]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:21.856 --> 01:05:26.859]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:30.001]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.242 --> 01:05:40.108]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:05:40.128 --> 01:05:44.371]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium
[01:05:44.551 --> 01:05:44.912]  We're good.
[01:05:55.461 --> 01:05:59.584]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.804 --> 01:06:01.565]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:08.129]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:14.534]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.794 --> 01:06:16.635]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:16.895 --> 01:06:17.255]  I think so.
[01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:42.628]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:42.648 --> 01:06:44.510]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:28.384]  Back in 1998, when President Bush was governor, at the end of his speech, I asked him a question, politely, the video is up on InfoWars.com, and he had me arrested, really kidnapped, I was driven around for about an hour, then thrown out on the Williamson County, Travis County line by the constable's office.
[01:07:30.385 --> 01:07:33.788]  Remember when the Republican Charles Key
[01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:44.521]  was going to be at the RNC debates and he was on the list but they just had him grabbed for an hour and thrown out on the side of the highway again.
[01:07:46.282 --> 01:07:47.602]  But it's happened a bunch of times.
[01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:50.864]  In fact, some editorials have now been written about this.
[01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:56.026]  There's a headline here, Secret Service Must Let Us Burst Ego Bubbles.
[01:07:57.106 --> 01:08:05.289]  And some of these stories here go into examples of how they've had a bunch of people arrested who say something rude to Cheney or even talk to Cheney.
[01:08:06.505 --> 01:08:13.368]  They have these fake town hall meetings where they bill them on the television and radio and print as open town halls.
[01:08:13.408 --> 01:08:18.951]  They have you sign a declaration swearing you support the president, swearing you won't disrupt.
[01:08:19.451 --> 01:08:21.672]  They take down your license plates in the parking lot.
[01:08:21.972 --> 01:08:22.312]  Oh yeah!
[01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:23.613]  That's America folks!
[01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:25.894]  That's America!
[01:08:27.735 --> 01:08:35.338]  And I scream bloody murder when Clinton in his last year in office would make freepers or free republic people
[01:08:36.218 --> 01:08:39.602]  Get in free speech zones and wouldn't let them demonstrate right in front of his hotel.
[01:08:40.463 --> 01:08:44.467]  Well, they've gone light years past this and now the freepers get online and say, Good!
[01:08:44.527 --> 01:08:45.428]  Ban protest!
[01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:46.069]  Ban!
[01:08:46.129 --> 01:08:46.890]  Arrest everyone!
[01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:47.731]  I've seen them, folks.
[01:08:47.771 --> 01:08:48.391]  They're scum.
[01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:50.314]  Absolute scum.
[01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.055]  Alright, I'm going to start ranting here.
[01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:52.836]  I'm having problems.
[01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:55.920]  We have the man on the line with his seven-year-old son.
[01:08:57.449 --> 01:08:59.430]  He was arrested in front of his seven-year-old son.
[01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:00.911]  His seven-year-old son isn't with us.
[01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:02.972]  He was there with him in Colorado.
[01:09:03.012 --> 01:09:04.053]  Lord Chaney was there.
[01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:07.595]  He just said, I think the war is reprehensible and went on walking.
[01:09:08.215 --> 01:09:09.996]  And here he is to tell us the story.
[01:09:10.016 --> 01:09:20.622]  And we are honored to have Stephen Howards, a successful consultant to nonprofits, on with us today, blasting out nationwide and worldwide.
[01:09:20.662 --> 01:09:21.563]  Thank you, Mr. Howards.
[01:09:24.634 --> 01:09:27.156]  Always, there's more to the story than just the paper's report.
[01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:40.145]  Can you give us, in the next ten minutes or so, a blow-by-blow of what happened that day, what they said to you, what the police said once you got to the station, how they've now had to drop the charges, why you're suing, and anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:42.347]  Sure.
[01:09:42.747 --> 01:09:45.129]  Well, it was probably about the middle of June.
[01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:50.013]  I live in Denver, and I was accompanying my kids
[01:09:50.974 --> 01:09:52.956]  Age now is actually 9 and 11.
[01:09:53.716 --> 01:10:02.383]  I was accompanying my kids to a piano camp in Beaver Creek, Colorado, which is a resort about an hour west of Denver.
[01:10:04.324 --> 01:10:13.190]  I just read the paper in the morning about all the people that were dying in Iraq and had this fantasy about what I'd do if I ever had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney.
[01:10:16.406 --> 01:10:23.312]  That afternoon, walking across a public square in Beaver Creek, Colorado, who walks past me but Mr. Chaney.
[01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:28.156]  And there were lots of Secret Service agents in the mall area.
[01:10:29.216 --> 01:10:33.820]  And, you know, probably about a handful of just Joe Schmoes walking around.
[01:10:35.862 --> 01:10:40.465]  And Mr. Chaney was walking around shaking hands, so I approached Mr. Chaney.
[01:10:41.566 --> 01:10:44.549]  I got about a foot or two away from him and I said,
[01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.464]  The policies in Iraq are reprehensible.
[01:10:50.225 --> 01:10:54.307]  And then I walked on, because I didn't want to give anybody any excuses to cause me any trouble.
[01:10:55.768 --> 01:10:57.989]  And I must say, I felt better for having said that.
[01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:04.393]  And about ten minutes later, I came back to this same square with my nine-year-old son in tow.
[01:11:05.734 --> 01:11:09.576]  And I was approached by a Secret Service agent who accused me, who actually asked me.
[01:11:10.097 --> 01:11:11.758]  I thought it was kind of strange to ask me.
[01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:13.939]  He asked me, did you assault the Vice President?
[01:11:15.865 --> 01:11:16.866]  I responded, no.
[01:11:18.527 --> 01:11:23.530]  But I said that what I did do was tell him the way I felt about the war in Iraq, and if that's against the law.
[01:11:25.131 --> 01:11:34.496]  Well, actually, I told him the way I felt about the war in Iraq, and if Mr. Cheney wants to be shielded from public criticism, he should avoid public places.
[01:11:35.237 --> 01:11:41.180]  And then I told him if exercising free speech was against the law, that he should arrest me.
[01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:44.302]  At which point, he grabbed me.
[01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:48.529]  I don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:12:12.319 --> 01:12:15.642]  I mean, it's just because every news article has always got stuff wrong in it.
[01:12:15.662 --> 01:12:16.662]  I don't know how they do this.
[01:12:17.443 --> 01:12:18.284]  I'm serious!
[01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:22.066]  Well, I tell you, being off by a year, you could do worse.
[01:12:22.086 --> 01:12:22.787]  Sure, exactly.
[01:12:22.807 --> 01:12:26.490]  You know, but that's... He was actually 8 at the time, not 7.
[01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:27.791]  Sure, well it doesn't matter.
[01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:28.431]  It's my new show.
[01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:30.733]  Let's go back here, because I want to go through this blow by blow.
[01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:34.055]  I was down there in 2000, covering the election.
[01:12:34.075 --> 01:12:34.756]  I live in Austin.
[01:12:35.336 --> 01:12:38.399]  And it was during the recounts and the stealing of the election.
[01:12:39.543 --> 01:12:42.104]  I was truly neutral at that time.
[01:12:42.144 --> 01:12:43.605]  I don't like Republicans or Democrats.
[01:12:45.545 --> 01:12:47.386]  Now, of course, I'm more anti-Bush than anything else.
[01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:48.046]  He's so evil.
[01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:53.128]  And in the second coming of Hitler, and I mean it when I say that, they've abolished the Bill of Rights, folks.
[01:12:54.309 --> 01:12:56.770]  But I'm down there peaceably with my video camera.
[01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:57.670]  I'm not demonstrating.
[01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:58.370]  I'm not yelling.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:12:59.391]  There's thousands of people.
[01:13:00.231 --> 01:13:02.152]  And Secret Service started coming over to me.
[01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:08.382]  And I always had the Hollywood image of them, of the handsome, clean-cut, friendly, but well-spoken serious.
[01:13:08.622 --> 01:13:09.883]  They were like gang members.
[01:13:10.706 --> 01:13:14.209]  And dressed up in like gold chains and gang member outfits.
[01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:15.450]  I guess that was their undercover.
[01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.011]  So you're planning something violent.
[01:13:17.071 --> 01:13:18.172]  Oh, did you just say something to me?
[01:13:18.212 --> 01:13:19.213]  Like shoving on me?
[01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:20.614]  How you doing Alex?
[01:13:20.634 --> 01:13:21.534]  Where you going Alex?
[01:13:22.115 --> 01:13:24.917]  And it actually scared me to see how thuggish they were.
[01:13:25.017 --> 01:13:30.962]  I wanted to get your description because you know you tamely say you just came up and said, Oh, did you assault the Vice President?
[01:13:30.982 --> 01:13:32.022]  Because that's how they do.
[01:13:32.062 --> 01:13:35.065]  And a person who wasn't as calm as you were might have said, No I didn't.
[01:13:35.465 --> 01:13:36.566]  Or you know something else.
[01:13:36.986 --> 01:13:41.689]  So they're trying to get you to basically set yourself up so they can frame you.
[01:13:41.889 --> 01:13:45.671]  But I mean, go back, blow by blow, you're walking along, what does he say exactly to you?
[01:13:46.492 --> 01:13:58.659]  I mean, exactly where he came out of the shadows, he takes his, whatever it is, his wallet or something out of his jacket pocket, flips it open, shows me his badge and says, uh, I'm with the Secret Service.
[01:13:59.842 --> 01:14:03.846]  And, you know, the question was, did you assault the Vice President?
[01:14:04.146 --> 01:14:05.527]  So he's with the Secret Police?
[01:14:05.907 --> 01:14:07.389]  He's with the Secret Service, right?
[01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:09.130]  Did you assault the Vice President?
[01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.792]  And I, you know, my response was no.
[01:14:12.053 --> 01:14:21.100]  I thought the whole thing, my initial reaction was, there were probably, I don't know, 15 Secret Service agents that I could see in that mall area.
[01:14:21.681 --> 01:14:24.143]  My reaction was, why, ten minutes later,
[01:14:24.972 --> 01:14:28.053]  Was this agent not accusing me, but asking me?
[01:14:28.213 --> 01:14:30.294]  Well, sir, they always do this.
[01:14:30.994 --> 01:14:34.275]  They've taught law enforcement this now, especially the higher-up feds.
[01:14:35.015 --> 01:14:40.057]  If they would have grabbed you right then, the other agents would have had to say, you didn't touch him, you didn't assault him.
[01:14:40.337 --> 01:14:41.878]  They had to wait until you left.
[01:14:41.898 --> 01:14:49.721]  A lot of times they'll follow people in a car, then claim something, then claim you resist, beat you down, and charge you with resisting then.
[01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:53.662]  So they go and they create a crime when the real crime
[01:14:54.861 --> 01:14:56.421]  Is there attempted frame-ups?
[01:14:56.461 --> 01:14:57.842]  You were in really dangerous waters.
[01:14:57.882 --> 01:14:58.222]  Go ahead.
[01:14:58.722 --> 01:15:04.064]  Well, it was a public area, so I said no and said my piece.
[01:15:04.084 --> 01:15:04.904]  See, that's the other thing.
[01:15:04.944 --> 01:15:13.306]  There were other witnesses, so they had to remove it to a later point, so those witnesses would have walked off, so those witnesses wouldn't have said, no, I was there.
[01:15:13.326 --> 01:15:13.646]  See?
[01:15:14.406 --> 01:15:20.668]  Well, what they did was handcuff me and I was very calm.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:26.342]  Given the circumstance, as they started to lead me away... What happened to your 8-year-old son?
[01:15:26.742 --> 01:15:28.603]  Well, I didn't know.
[01:15:28.943 --> 01:15:34.126]  As they started to lead me away, I turned to the agent and I said, you can't take me away.
[01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:37.067]  I can't abandon my 8-year-old son in a public mall.
[01:15:38.169 --> 01:15:40.590]  And he turned to me and said, well, we'll call social services.
[01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:42.071]  There you go, CPS.
[01:15:42.711 --> 01:15:45.613]  And, uh... Well, then I'm sure interrogated him to see if they could snatch him.
[01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:46.873]  No, what do you know?
[01:15:46.893 --> 01:15:49.254]  That's not... Well, what happened was, he led me across the mall.
[01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:52.256]  We crossed my wife on the way, who happened to be in the same area.
[01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:55.898]  I told her that I was... I, you know, I'd lost my son.
[01:15:55.998 --> 01:15:56.978]  Oh, thank God!
[01:15:57.058 --> 01:16:02.761]  So... And, and, and she said... And apparently... And she said to me, well, he saw you handcuffed.
[01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:06.000]  He ran away in terror, and he ran to me.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.361]  Good, good, good, good instincts.
[01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:11.303]  And, you know, he was speechless.
[01:16:11.323 --> 01:16:13.283]  He couldn't talk when he ran to her.
[01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:14.064]  He was so traumatized.
[01:16:14.124 --> 01:16:14.804]  Oh my God.
[01:16:15.644 --> 01:16:25.849]  And they took me to their black SUV, stuck me in there with my head cuffed behind my back, took me to Eagle County Jail.
[01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.151]  Where they held me in handcuffs for several hours.
[01:16:29.311 --> 01:16:30.292]  And this is the key point.
[01:16:30.892 --> 01:16:36.575]  And then lied and claimed there was an assault later because of witnesses and other information.
[01:16:36.595 --> 01:16:38.276]  The county dropped it, thank God.
[01:16:38.976 --> 01:16:42.478]  I'm glad you're suing them because they committed the crime of false imprisonment.
[01:16:42.538 --> 01:16:44.039]  As you know, that's what you're suing them under.
[01:16:44.259 --> 01:16:44.839]  Good job.
[01:16:44.899 --> 01:16:47.601]  I hope they all lose their jobs, a bunch of criminals.
[01:16:48.421 --> 01:16:56.085]  Well, what happened was, when we got there, the agent basically was told
[01:16:56.952 --> 01:16:57.573]  We're good to go.
[01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:15.932]  Was there an exchange?
[01:17:15.952 --> 01:17:20.975]  Did the Dark Lord, that Oberman now calls the Chilling One, he is a dark force, did he say something back to you, the lowly peasant?
[01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:25.199]  No, he just looked at me kind of with a blank stare and moved on as I moved on.
[01:17:44.066 --> 01:17:52.333]  You know, given the fact that I was, as I said, probably no more than two feet away from him, there's no question he heard what I said.
[01:17:53.613 --> 01:18:00.699]  Let me just say, sir, you had a lot of courage because I've done what you've done and it is hard to walk up to a super high-powered person.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.220]  The President.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240]  He really is the President.
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.061]  Everybody knows that.
[01:18:04.361 --> 01:18:13.983]  To walk up to the illegitimate President, a person who's stolen elections, a person who's overthrown the Bill of Rights, a person who's engaged in illegal wars, a person who has authorized torture of children.
[01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:19.105]  You have a lot of courage, and if more Americans were like you, we wouldn't be in this position.
[01:18:19.325 --> 01:18:24.626]  Those snakes shouldn't be able to go anywhere without people letting them know that we know they're scum.
[01:18:29.528 --> 01:18:33.231]  I get a little bit emotional about this, Mr. Howard.
[01:18:35.412 --> 01:18:37.794]  Well, you know, so we... Well, stay there.
[01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:38.214]  We've got a break.
[01:18:38.234 --> 01:18:38.715]  We've got a break.
[01:18:39.035 --> 01:18:39.455]  Come back.
[01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:47.701]  Obviously, I need you to stay a little bit longer than one more segment because I want to get into the overall chilling effect this is causing and I want to hear the rest of your story.
[01:18:47.741 --> 01:18:48.142]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.815 --> 01:18:56.836]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:57.156 --> 01:19:02.078]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.338 --> 01:19:06.679]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.979 --> 01:19:15.882]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:16.102 --> 01:19:19.723]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:20.003 --> 01:19:25.030]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:32.039]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.549 --> 01:19:33.190]  What about you?
[01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:39.195]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:19:39.255 --> 01:19:40.416]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:19:40.436 --> 01:19:42.317]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:19:53.519 --> 01:19:55.301]  Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.401 --> 01:19:56.242]  Today is October 6, 2006.
[01:19:56.322 --> 01:19:57.143]  Gold opened at $586.80.
[01:19:57.183 --> 01:19:58.724]  And one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $599.25.
[01:19:58.764 --> 01:20:00.867]  Again, that's $599.25 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:20:07.443 --> 01:20:10.125]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[01:20:10.545 --> 01:20:15.167]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[01:20:15.568 --> 01:20:16.968]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[01:20:17.429 --> 01:20:20.570]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:26.414]  We the people labor to create the money only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[01:20:26.794 --> 01:20:28.355]  They in turn lend it back to us
[01:20:28.775 --> 01:20:32.496]  And we the people are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[01:20:32.877 --> 01:20:37.778]  Minus Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[01:20:38.178 --> 01:20:38.459]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.479 --> 01:20:40.959]  If you haven't read this book, get a copy today.
[01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:41.400]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.540]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:43.881]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.494 --> 01:20:56.975]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:20:57.096 --> 01:20:59.457]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:20:59.517 --> 01:21:06.601]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[01:21:07.181 --> 01:21:09.483]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:21:10.143 --> 01:21:13.685]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:21:14.225 --> 01:21:18.368]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:21:18.948 --> 01:21:21.890]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:21:22.893 --> 01:21:25.814]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:21:26.554 --> 01:21:32.535]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:21:32.635 --> 01:21:35.616]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:39.277]  For the following two free reports.
[01:21:40.157 --> 01:21:40.437]  U.S.
[01:21:40.537 --> 01:21:43.458]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:21:44.418 --> 01:21:46.699]  Call 888-XANADU.
[01:21:46.759 --> 01:21:50.940]  That's 888-XANADU.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.240]  And ask for George.
[01:21:54.555 --> 01:21:56.237]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:21:56.417 --> 01:21:59.020]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.143]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[01:22:02.383 --> 01:22:05.847]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[01:22:06.127 --> 01:22:11.953]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest greatest nutritional wonder products?
[01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:17.094]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:27.736]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?
[01:22:28.016 --> 01:22:29.296]  Well, you just did.
[01:22:29.656 --> 01:22:30.616]  So don't hesitate.
[01:22:30.716 --> 01:22:34.757]  Take the living energy you've always wanted from your nutrition right now.

[01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:44.219]  805-595-2711.
[01:22:44.239 --> 01:22:49.362]  Alright, I know we've had a lot of phones, and we're going to go to Chris, Keith, Cliff, Delano, Greg,
[01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.728]  We'll be talking to you at the 40 after.
[01:23:11.748 --> 01:23:15.072]  That's when our guest is going to leave us this segment and then part of the next.
[01:23:15.733 --> 01:23:17.715]  There's just tons of other news I'm going to be getting into.
[01:23:19.658 --> 01:23:22.141]  Stephen Howard, and folks you should get mad.
[01:23:22.381 --> 01:23:23.383]  These people are criminals.
[01:23:24.805 --> 01:23:31.127]  Arresting citizens because they just say something to the President, and that's who Dick Cheney is, he's the President.
[01:23:31.687 --> 01:23:35.729]  That, he's not the Vice President, that is your right, your birthright.
[01:23:36.289 --> 01:23:39.750]  I mean, in Russia, until a few years ago, they didn't arrest you for doing that.
[01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.571]  Since the Magna Carta, they couldn't do this.
[01:23:43.971 --> 01:23:51.774]  I want to specifically, not just talk about your lawsuit and the chilling effect this is causing nationwide, now the news is reporting that dozens of people have been arrested for saying stuff to Bush and Cheney.
[01:23:52.936 --> 01:23:58.261]  This is the default position, but what did these goons look like?
[01:23:58.301 --> 01:23:59.142]  How did they act like?
[01:23:59.162 --> 01:24:00.683]  Were they self-righteous?
[01:24:00.964 --> 01:24:02.205]  Did you pity them?
[01:24:02.225 --> 01:24:04.547]  Were you sad for this country?
[01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:09.091]  I know I was when I was kidnapped for questioning his lordship when he was only a regional governor.
[01:24:09.952 --> 01:24:13.035]  Will you tell us your feelings on that, Mr. Howards?
[01:24:13.776 --> 01:24:15.117]  Yeah, I mean, I was just stunned.
[01:24:18.829 --> 01:24:21.490]  That something like this could be happening in America.
[01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:25.732]  And that was probably, in retrospect, shows you how naive I was.
[01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:46.042]  I mean, I knew these types of arrests were occurring, but I thought my interchange was so incredibly innocuous that it did never occur to me that I could end up being handcuffed and charged with felony assault in the presence of my eight-year-old son for expressing six words
[01:24:47.092 --> 01:24:51.213]  of opposition to the administration's policies in Iraq.
[01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:53.054]  Have you been listening to talk radio?
[01:24:53.114 --> 01:25:03.317]  These sickening creatures, I don't even want to call them conservatives, have been calling in, laughing at you, saying we all deserve it, we should be locked up in camps, we're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:03.357 --> 01:25:11.380]  See, it's now treason, and Keith Olbermann said this last night, it's now treason under the new bill to question their war because the war is there to keep us safe.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.681]  Don't you understand that, Mr. Howard, that people are saying you need to be arrested again?
[01:25:16.621 --> 01:25:29.886]  Well, you know, I'll tell you, this is, I think, what I find scary, is that this administration has argued that, you know, I think everybody's united in the need to fight terrorism.
[01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:32.707]  I don't think there's much division on that issue.
[01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:39.729]  The division is whether or not this administration's approach to fighting terrorism is the way to do the job.
[01:25:40.824 --> 01:25:43.326]  And what they're basically saying... Well, let's get honest.
[01:25:43.366 --> 01:25:50.432]  I mean, it's like Keith Olbermann said, and I keep quoting his incredible speech, he said that they're attacking the Constitution as if the terrorists are hidden inside of it.
[01:25:50.693 --> 01:25:52.394]  None of this has anything to do with terrorism.
[01:25:52.594 --> 01:25:55.036]  It's about setting up a dictatorial executive.
[01:25:55.536 --> 01:26:05.385]  Well, that's what, you know, I think what's occurred here is they've made the argument, obviously, and they've reflected this through their actions, that if you criticize their policies,
[01:26:06.105 --> 01:26:06.926]  Towards terrorism.
[01:26:07.226 --> 01:26:09.307]  What you're doing is you're providing support to Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:09.467 --> 01:26:11.228]  And you're not allowed to question in America.
[01:26:11.268 --> 01:26:11.929]  How dare you?
[01:26:12.349 --> 01:26:18.412]  And if you're criticizing their policies, you're the equivalent of a Nazi sympathizer.
[01:26:18.452 --> 01:26:19.953]  They said that publicly as well.
[01:26:20.954 --> 01:26:26.897]  Did you say anything to the Secret Service in the back of the truck or the police station when you heard they were charging you and they were still there filling out papers?
[01:26:27.138 --> 01:26:32.721]  Did you say you're a liar or how dare you or you're a shameful person or were you smart enough to keep quiet?
[01:26:33.497 --> 01:26:35.798]  I was smart enough to keep quiet.
[01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:38.480]  But, you know, let me finish.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:59.271]  I mean, the last piece of this link, the missing piece of this link, is now, I think, again, what's reflected in what happened to me, which is that now if you actually criticize the administration, you are therefore posing a threat to national security
[01:27:00.046 --> 01:27:03.187]  And therefore, you are subject in their minds to arrest.
[01:27:03.287 --> 01:27:03.707]  That's it?
[01:27:03.907 --> 01:27:08.329]  And that is, you know, a frontal assault on our Constitution.
[01:27:09.029 --> 01:27:13.891]  A frontal assault, that's a blatant attempt to suppress free speech.
[01:27:14.671 --> 01:27:24.254]  And that's the scariest link of all, is when they start saying that by simply, by opposing their policies, you are therefore
[01:27:25.069 --> 01:27:30.351]  Posing a threat to national security, providing support to Al Qaeda, and subject to arrest.
[01:27:31.151 --> 01:27:33.472]  And that, I think, is one of the scariest of all.
[01:27:33.572 --> 01:27:47.897]  And one of the things I've said many times is that twisted logic and that frontal assault on our Constitution is a much greater threat to our freedom than Osama Bin Laden will ever be.
[01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:53.159]  And it's just a tragedy that this nation doesn't seem to recognize
[01:27:54.244 --> 01:28:00.829]  What this administration is attempting to accomplish under the banner of its fight against terrorism.
[01:28:00.869 --> 01:28:04.652]  Did you see the Houston Chronicle admitting they're building FEMA camps for American dissidents?
[01:28:05.633 --> 01:28:06.634]  No, I did not.
[01:28:06.654 --> 01:28:08.555]  I'm not kidding.
[01:28:08.715 --> 01:28:09.876]  I know you haven't checked that out.
[01:28:09.896 --> 01:28:12.038]  Does that shock you?
[01:28:13.039 --> 01:28:17.762]  Well, you know, I tell you, I'm not shocked by a lot of things anymore.
[01:28:18.963 --> 01:28:21.145]  But what I'm most shocked by is the
[01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:31.039]  acquiescence and complacency of both the Democrats and the public at large as our rights are kind of slithered away.
[01:28:31.499 --> 01:28:31.980]  You're right.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.103]  Congress is being blackmailed predominantly or paid off, and the American people are busy watching their sitcoms.
[01:28:37.163 --> 01:28:38.224]  Final segment with our guest.
[01:28:38.264 --> 01:28:41.467]  I want to talk about this chilling effect and where his lawsuit's going.
[01:28:44.489 --> 01:28:45.470]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:47.491]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.412 --> 01:28:51.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:59.015]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:28:59.055 --> 01:28:59.795]  have diabetes.
[01:29:00.116 --> 01:29:07.000]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:11.683]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:29:11.883 --> 01:29:14.705]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:29:54.272 --> 01:29:57.856]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.896 --> 01:29:58.396]  are located?
[01:29:58.597 --> 01:30:01.980]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:30:12.452 --> 01:30:13.033]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.532 --> 01:30:32.932]  I think so.
[01:30:54.298 --> 01:30:56.641]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:56.881 --> 01:30:58.923]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:59.063 --> 01:31:06.111]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:14.940]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:31:41.883 --> 01:31:44.444]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:32:01.258 --> 01:32:04.899]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:22.246]  Make no mistake, these minions, Secret Service, State Police, Protective Detail, and Bush was Governor, they're under orders to arrest anybody that says anything embarrassing, or who confronts the President, or when he was Governor in any way, or any of his minions.
[01:32:22.826 --> 01:32:28.768]  And there are scores of cases of this, and a man who's suing and fighting back
[01:32:30.852 --> 01:32:33.913]  We're really honored to have him on with us.
[01:32:33.933 --> 01:32:35.454]  He's been very dignified about this.
[01:32:36.674 --> 01:32:37.634]  He's playing the good cop.
[01:32:37.694 --> 01:32:39.255]  I was telling him in the break, I'm the bad cop.
[01:32:39.435 --> 01:32:41.915]  I am very upset about what's happening.
[01:32:41.935 --> 01:32:48.517]  I want to talk about your suit before you leave us and any other caveats about the locals when they finally dropped the charges.
[01:32:49.458 --> 01:32:50.718]  But before we do that,
[01:32:51.779 --> 01:32:54.180]  During the break we were discussing all the other cases of this.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.820]  I mean, school teachers getting arrested.
[01:32:56.261 --> 01:32:58.121]  People standing there with a sign get arrested.
[01:32:58.141 --> 01:33:01.682]  You can have 500 Bush supporters on the side of the street without a permit.
[01:33:02.023 --> 01:33:04.163]  One person, no war sign, gets arrested.
[01:33:04.183 --> 01:33:07.164]  And a federal court gave him two years in prison.
[01:33:07.544 --> 01:33:12.066]  So, I mean, this is land of the slave, home of the minion.
[01:33:13.246 --> 01:33:15.047]  Talk about some of those other cases you're aware of.
[01:33:15.987 --> 01:33:20.929]  Well, I mean, there's no question that what happened to me is part of a pattern.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.542]  And there's a pattern of suppression of freedom of speech and intimidation that's occurring across the country.
[01:33:27.382 --> 01:33:31.824]  As I said before, that has to do with this final assault on our Constitution, and that is what's very scary.
[01:33:32.685 --> 01:33:44.990]  You know, people have sent me articles from all over the country, and one of the most striking was, well, one of them happened in Denver, where three people were removed from a public-sponsored event
[01:33:45.836 --> 01:33:54.243]  Because, uh, a Bush-sponsored event where Bush was speaking because on their car there was a bumper sticker that said, uh, what does it say?
[01:33:55.003 --> 01:33:56.865]  No blood for, uh, what does it say?
[01:33:57.754 --> 01:33:59.175]  No blood for oil!
[01:33:59.215 --> 01:34:16.765]  We have secret police sneaking around all the parking lots, even when low-level Bush administration officials are in town, and then going and people have to sign pledges to go be part of the staged Soviet-style town hall meetings.
[01:34:16.825 --> 01:34:17.666]  Is that America?
[01:34:18.807 --> 01:34:24.370]  There's another one that was in Iowa, a 55-year-old female schoolteacher.
[01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:38.278]  Her school was recessed because Bush was in a small town in Iowa, and according to the Wire Stories, she went to the Bush rally with a sign that protested the war.
[01:34:39.559 --> 01:34:48.025]  She kept being asked to get further and further away, at which point she responded to the Secret Service agent, what's the good of me being here if I'm so far away?
[01:34:48.045 --> 01:34:51.868]  The President can't see my sign, at which point she too was arrested.
[01:34:53.137 --> 01:35:12.493]  I think, you know, as you said earlier, the real chilling effect is that when each of these things happens, you know, when my arrest occurred and when we filed our suit, you know, the downside is that everybody in the country knows, you know, what you can be subject to for simply turning out and expressing your opposition to government policies.
[01:35:13.134 --> 01:35:22.241]  And that plays right into the administration's strategy, because it does have a chilling effect on the ability of other people to show up
[01:35:22.924 --> 01:35:24.865]  And do the same thing.
[01:35:24.925 --> 01:35:27.487]  It's only going to get worse unless people like you sue them.
[01:35:27.507 --> 01:35:30.008]  These criminals need to be brought to justice.
[01:35:30.028 --> 01:35:42.815]  The scary thing is some of their minion courts have said, it's like Rankin was before he died, it was over 200 different judges at a big meeting, AP reported, and he said, listen, we're not following the Constitution during the war on terror, go out and rule against it.
[01:35:43.516 --> 01:35:49.179]  Now the Attorney General tells the judges, you don't rule against our new bill we just passed last Friday.
[01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:51.020]  I mean, these guys are...
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:52.661]  Again, it's scary.
[01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:53.541]  It's really happening.
[01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:56.883]  In closing, your lawsuit... Well, I've got two more questions.
[01:35:56.943 --> 01:35:58.123]  I want to say one other thing, though.
[01:35:58.243 --> 01:36:01.164]  I think, ultimately, these guys didn't step into power.
[01:36:02.465 --> 01:36:07.567]  Maybe there are questions about how the first election was decided, but the second time around, Bush won.
[01:36:08.148 --> 01:36:17.732]  So, ultimately, the American public is the one that's responsible for what we're seeing laid at our feet right now, and the American public also has the ability to change things.
[01:36:18.882 --> 01:36:21.825]  And what we're getting right now is exactly what we deserve.
[01:36:22.065 --> 01:36:24.487]  And if we don't like what we're getting, we've got the ability to change it.
[01:36:24.767 --> 01:36:29.371]  And there are elections coming up real soon, and that's when people need to make their voices heard.
[01:36:30.192 --> 01:36:30.932]  Now, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:36:31.172 --> 01:36:36.617]  No, no, no, I totally agree with you in that it's our fault this happened, but it's our fault we let them put in
[01:36:37.506 --> 01:36:41.529]  fraudulent voting machines, and they clearly stole Ohio and New Mexico.
[01:36:41.589 --> 01:36:51.517]  So, you know, to say that he stole it once, but not the second time, I disagree with you on that, but I do agree that it's our fault that this has happened, and I don't want to discourage people to vote.
[01:36:51.858 --> 01:36:55.020]  They only have the CIA-controlled machines in 35% of the country.
[01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:57.182]  We can still, really, that's what's happened.
[01:36:57.502 --> 01:37:03.227]  So you're going to find out, listen, Stephen, you're a smart guy, but folks like you are going to find it's even worse than you know, okay?
[01:37:03.787 --> 01:37:04.368]  Believe me, sir.
[01:37:04.748 --> 01:37:05.708]  I mean, it's real bad.
[01:37:05.728 --> 01:37:07.970]  I'm not trying to scare people, but just two final points.
[01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:10.051]  How has this traumatized your son?
[01:37:10.531 --> 01:37:17.456]  And I just want to tell you, thank God he got to your wife at the nearby shop, because they like to pressure CPS to then, in these political cases, find some dirt.
[01:37:17.776 --> 01:37:21.378]  That's the second fiery ring you have to go through.
[01:37:21.398 --> 01:37:27.482]  So I want to get your take on that, and in closing, what your suit's calling for, what your lawyer thinks is going to happen.
[01:37:28.979 --> 01:37:34.382]  Well, my son just took a couple days for us to get him to kind of talk to us and cool out.
[01:37:34.562 --> 01:37:35.903]  I mean, hopefully he's okay.
[01:37:44.617 --> 01:37:45.278]  Big Brother.
[01:37:45.939 --> 01:37:47.020]  Mainstream media.
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:48.802]  Government cover-ups.
[01:37:49.462 --> 01:37:50.263]  You want answers?
[01:37:51.044 --> 01:37:51.925]  Well, so does he.
[01:37:51.945 --> 01:37:56.310]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:37:56.790 --> 01:38:00.895]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:38:03.117 --> 01:38:06.481]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:38:07.153 --> 01:38:10.395]  You can always tune in to our free podcast every day.

[01:38:24.166 --> 01:38:26.287]  Courtesy of my pocketbook.
[01:38:26.768 --> 01:38:28.249]  But it's all about the information.
[01:38:29.210 --> 01:38:31.171]  Let us now go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:38:31.331 --> 01:38:33.853]  As promised, this entire hour, masses of calls.
[01:38:34.113 --> 01:38:34.994]  But I'm going to move quick.
[01:38:35.723 --> 01:38:37.284]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:38:37.324 --> 01:38:37.744]  Go ahead.
[01:38:38.344 --> 01:38:38.944]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:38:39.084 --> 01:38:40.405]  And thanks for having your guest.
[01:38:40.485 --> 01:38:42.545]  For those who haven't got Terror Storm, I got it.
[01:38:42.565 --> 01:38:43.506]  I'm making copies.
[01:38:43.766 --> 01:38:44.186]  Good.
[01:38:44.226 --> 01:38:45.947]  It is very vital.
[01:38:46.047 --> 01:38:48.467]  And I wanted to point out something about it, a clip in your Terror Storm.
[01:38:48.487 --> 01:38:54.089]  You know how the Bush supporters are all for Bush, but getting near them and getting near the President and getting arrested.
[01:38:54.369 --> 01:38:56.390]  I mean, this is vital stuff, folks.
[01:38:57.090 --> 01:39:01.592]  And I just advise you, get this film, get copies made.
[01:39:02.233 --> 01:39:03.253]  And get them out to people.
[01:39:03.553 --> 01:39:15.095]  I also have some Kentucky news that now the public schools, since all the school shootings, are going to have lockdown drills and it's going to be mandated now to have searches, possibly strip searches.
[01:39:15.395 --> 01:39:17.676]  Is this 5295 bill that's out here?
[01:39:18.156 --> 01:39:22.217]  Oh yeah, Congress wants to make it where random strip searches.
[01:39:22.577 --> 01:39:24.837]  Not, oh we think you have a knife, we're going to check your pants.
[01:39:25.257 --> 01:39:28.778]  Now, oh just line up, we're government pedophiles here.
[01:39:29.498 --> 01:39:29.999]  Who they are.
[01:39:30.059 --> 01:39:31.280]  Higher numbers in those areas.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.161]  We just need to search you now.
[01:39:33.522 --> 01:39:34.583]  And it's prison life.
[01:39:34.663 --> 01:39:35.403]  Shakedowns.
[01:39:35.463 --> 01:39:36.544]  They search them.
[01:39:36.604 --> 01:39:37.505]  Dogs search them.
[01:39:37.605 --> 01:39:38.086]  Fences.
[01:39:38.526 --> 01:39:39.487]  ID cards to get in.
[01:39:39.547 --> 01:39:41.789]  It's training for the prison system.
[01:39:42.129 --> 01:39:54.720]  When a child has, what is it, 11 times, last time I checked in the Almanac, better chance of drowning in a swimming pool, even when they're over 12, it's even higher when you're below 12, than you do of being killed in a school shooting.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.401]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:55.421 --> 01:39:56.041]  Good to hear from you.
[01:39:56.141 --> 01:39:56.902]  It's despicable!
[01:39:57.384 --> 01:40:00.065]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Detroit.
[01:40:00.105 --> 01:40:01.085]  Thank you, Keith, for holding.
[01:40:01.125 --> 01:40:01.505]  Welcome.
[01:40:01.905 --> 01:40:02.565]  Good afternoon.
[01:40:02.605 --> 01:40:03.025]  How are you?
[01:40:03.205 --> 01:40:03.605]  Good, sir.
[01:40:04.505 --> 01:40:05.445]  I've got a question for you.
[01:40:05.465 --> 01:40:07.466]  I've been postulating this for quite a bit.
[01:40:08.126 --> 01:40:17.028]  Is it possible at all that the Founding Fathers, seeing that most of those who penned our founding documents were complicit?
[01:40:17.108 --> 01:40:19.628]  Well, they were involved in the secret societies and whatnot.
[01:40:19.668 --> 01:40:24.689]  And we all know that Satan's got a master plan on how he's going to take and dominate, try to dominate.
[01:40:25.475 --> 01:40:33.103]  That they used our founding documents to try and foment hostility towards the Third World War.
[01:40:33.983 --> 01:40:49.459]  And what I mean by this is that there are going to be the people that go along with this, you know, this New World Order, blindly, a bunch of puppets and clones, and then there's going to be the people that are set out against it, which, you know, you and I are.
[01:40:50.802 --> 01:40:55.003]  And we'll be quickly rounded up and put to death, and then the rest of the people... No, that's not what's going to happen.
[01:40:55.023 --> 01:40:56.424]  You know, they say it's the end of the world.
[01:40:56.444 --> 01:41:01.185]  They've been saying that since Paul's time, and they're always saying you can't fight evil.
[01:41:01.245 --> 01:41:02.665]  They told the founders that.
[01:41:02.705 --> 01:41:04.305]  They told people when we fought Hitler that.
[01:41:04.906 --> 01:41:09.507]  Regardless, we have a duty to fight evil, or if you believe the Bible, we'll go to hell.
[01:41:09.887 --> 01:41:14.188]  If you know about an evil and you don't fight it, the blood is on your hands.
[01:41:15.304 --> 01:41:16.805]  I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.
[01:41:16.845 --> 01:41:18.686]  I'm just saying how people extrapolate.
[01:41:18.926 --> 01:41:19.326]  Right, right.
[01:41:19.466 --> 01:41:21.968]  Also, Romans 13, don't fight evil with evil.
[01:41:22.008 --> 01:41:22.848]  Fight evil for good.
[01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:25.269]  It'll keep colds upon your enemy's head.
[01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:29.191]  If he needs rest, give him a place to sleep.
[01:41:29.211 --> 01:41:32.353]  But are you saying Romans 13 means we shouldn't stand up against evil?
[01:41:32.613 --> 01:41:33.073]  No, no, no.
[01:41:33.313 --> 01:41:36.395]  I'm just saying that there are some people... Because that's what the churches teach now.
[01:41:36.415 --> 01:41:37.396]  Yeah, I know.
[01:41:38.196 --> 01:41:42.118]  There are some people that'll say, you know, I'll die before they get my guns.
[01:41:42.813 --> 01:41:43.553]  Something like that.
[01:41:44.714 --> 01:41:46.675]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:41:46.695 --> 01:41:50.977]  If they come and take you, your wife and your children, if you have children, to a camp, are you going to go with them?
[01:41:51.497 --> 01:41:56.660]  Well, I have to say that my children, I know, will be protected by Jesus' blood, because He loves all children.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:58.020]  Really?
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.942]  So, there were people who thought that in Germany.
[01:42:00.962 --> 01:42:05.884]  You're saying that if men come to take you to a death camp, you're going to go?
[01:42:06.524 --> 01:42:12.047]  Well, I'd rather fight not to, but once they start making the laws to where it's a
[01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:14.714]  So you're not going to submit to gun confiscation?
[01:42:14.734 --> 01:42:16.575]  I definitely will not.
[01:42:16.615 --> 01:42:16.875]  Good.
[01:42:16.895 --> 01:42:17.775]  God bless you.
[01:42:17.795 --> 01:42:19.716]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:40.123 --> 01:42:45.424]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:42:45.624 --> 01:42:47.705]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:42:47.945 --> 01:42:55.066]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:42:55.186 --> 01:43:06.709]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:43:07.089 --> 01:43:14.494]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible sorts of auxiliary backup power.
[01:43:14.754 --> 01:43:19.758]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:43:19.878 --> 01:43:24.901]  Disconnect your application and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:43:25.181 --> 01:43:30.505]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:48.737]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:56.723]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:43:57.438 --> 01:44:04.481]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:16.325]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:20.126]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:22.507]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:44:22.847 --> 01:44:26.689]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:39.137]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:40.497 --> 01:44:42.979]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:44:43.079 --> 01:44:45.460]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:52.604]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[01:44:53.185 --> 01:44:55.366]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:44:56.118 --> 01:44:59.660]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:45:00.221 --> 01:45:04.364]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:07.906]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:45:08.887 --> 01:45:11.829]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:45:12.529 --> 01:45:14.991]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:45:15.031 --> 01:45:16.972]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:45:26.147 --> 01:45:26.427]  U.S.
[01:45:26.527 --> 01:45:29.408]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:45:30.388 --> 01:45:38.270]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[01:45:40.311 --> 01:45:45.832]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:50.373]  Wide open phones in this third and final hour at 800-259-9231.
[01:45:50.393 --> 01:45:50.433]  800-259-9231.
[01:45:50.613 --> 01:46:00.121]  I'm going to move quickly though because I want to give everybody a chance to get on board, to have your questions or comments ready.
[01:46:00.902 --> 01:46:01.663]  Coming up, Bush.
[01:46:02.802 --> 01:46:06.224]  Signings called, effort to expand power, Boston Globe, I will get into that.
[01:46:06.844 --> 01:46:11.387]  Also, Britain's Observer claims threats by Washington prompted a Heathrow terror rage.
[01:46:11.747 --> 01:46:13.888]  Turns out that was all fake, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:14.268 --> 01:46:15.009]  Provocateur.
[01:46:15.049 --> 01:46:18.631]  But again, a month later, you find out it was all fake.
[01:46:19.411 --> 01:46:23.594]  You can argue with the average idiot on the street about it because they just aren't tuned in.
[01:46:23.614 --> 01:46:25.855]  They're not focused on real issues!
[01:46:26.471 --> 01:46:29.753]  They're focused on sitcoms or sports, and that's why they're not successful.
[01:46:30.094 --> 01:46:31.294]  It's why they're losing their country.
[01:46:31.575 --> 01:46:32.795]  It's why they're losing their children.
[01:46:34.336 --> 01:46:38.039]  If you're not involved in the world, folks, and fighting for your freedom, you're going to be a slave.
[01:46:38.079 --> 01:46:40.861]  And a lot of times, even if you fight for your freedom, you're going to be a slave.
[01:46:43.423 --> 01:46:51.748]  All the things we've had, all the milk and honey, all of the good things this country has enjoyed is because people sacrificed before us.
[01:46:53.509 --> 01:46:54.990]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:46:56.408 --> 01:47:01.550]  Greg in Canada, then Don, James, Steve, David and others.
[01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:03.131]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Greg.
[01:47:03.431 --> 01:47:05.072]  Hey Greg, or Alex, what's up?
[01:47:05.892 --> 01:47:08.553]  Doing a national-international radio broadcast, my friend.
[01:47:08.873 --> 01:47:09.173]  Awesome.
[01:47:09.354 --> 01:47:10.154]  I love your show.
[01:47:11.114 --> 01:47:15.016]  You made the prediction back in the summer that there was going to be an attack before
[01:47:15.563 --> 01:47:16.964]  The November midterm elections?
[01:47:17.484 --> 01:47:25.130]  That's not my full... Again, everybody who repeats my prediction never says it correctly, and I always wonder why.
[01:47:26.271 --> 01:47:33.656]  Just like it was the same prediction I made in July of 2000, the 2001 that came true, about 9-11.
[01:47:33.736 --> 01:47:34.977]  What was my full prediction?
[01:47:36.258 --> 01:47:37.079]  Your full prediction?
[01:47:37.879 --> 01:47:38.980]  Yeah, my full prediction.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:44.124]  Oh, I'm just saying, the Neocon talk radio are saying the exact same thing that you're saying.
[01:47:44.571 --> 01:47:46.871]  That they're going to carry out an attack at any time.
[01:47:47.031 --> 01:47:47.592]  It's imminent.
[01:47:48.192 --> 01:47:50.072]  I don't believe that for a second.
[01:47:50.892 --> 01:47:52.913]  Personally, I don't think they need another attack.
[01:47:54.033 --> 01:48:04.035]  I think right now they want the Democrats to come in, take the place of the Republicans, because all the dissent is basically directed towards the Republicans.
[01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:05.255]  Right now.
[01:48:06.195 --> 01:48:11.436]  And to quell the dissent, they're going to put in the Democrats, and then we're going to go back to sleep, the majority.
[01:48:13.132 --> 01:48:14.716]  And then they'll just keep rolling forward.
[01:48:14.756 --> 01:48:16.841]  That may be the case.
[01:48:17.523 --> 01:48:20.189]  But let me just, for the record, give you my full prediction.
[01:48:21.405 --> 01:48:23.387]  That we wrote down and that we announced here on air.
[01:48:23.567 --> 01:48:40.859]  If we do not get the word out, if we do not scream bloody murder, if we do not cause a revelation, a renaissance of understanding of who carried out 9-11 and government-sponsored terrorism, then they're going to stage some type of huge attack as a pretext to take us into Iran.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.222]  And I appreciate your, well, I'm going to let you comment here in a moment.
[01:48:45.226 --> 01:48:48.268]  I don't think it's fair to let you go right now, but I want to get your take on what I'm about to say.
[01:48:48.968 --> 01:48:51.590]  All of what you say is well and good and may happen, but here's the problem.
[01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:53.171]  They want to go into Iran.
[01:48:53.211 --> 01:48:54.232]  They're masked to do it.
[01:48:54.592 --> 01:49:01.276]  It's the same thing we saw pre-Iraq attack, and so they may need an attack to do that, or they may just not care.
[01:49:02.283 --> 01:49:10.530]  They may just go ahead and attack Iran, and that's the thing that sends us into a larger global crisis.
[01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:14.312]  No one will still rally around these neocons when they're the ones that caused it.
[01:49:15.713 --> 01:49:17.235]  It's a very complex time.
[01:49:17.535 --> 01:49:18.796]  There is war in heaven.
[01:49:20.096 --> 01:49:25.719]  As Chris Floyd, syndicated columnist, said yesterday, up in Washington, we call that hell.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.561]  Some call it heaven.
[01:49:28.541 --> 01:49:29.902]  The titans are fighting.
[01:49:30.382 --> 01:49:32.944]  There is some groups in the elite that want to slow things down.
[01:49:32.984 --> 01:49:34.284]  They think it's too dangerous.
[01:49:34.605 --> 01:49:40.528]  The globalist neocons are so arrogant, full of hubris and chutzpah, that they believe they can just go ahead and get away with it.
[01:49:40.968 --> 01:49:49.274]  Well, I'm just saying that the neocon talk radio, Glenn Beck, they're all beating the same drum, the doom-mongering, and I'm just... I don't think they need another tech, maybe to bring in the North American Union, because
[01:50:07.964 --> 01:50:08.565]  I'm in Canada.
[01:50:08.705 --> 01:50:09.705]  I'm not going to accept that.
[01:50:09.766 --> 01:50:13.669]  I know I'm going to fight tooth and nail.
[01:50:13.949 --> 01:50:14.970]  I'm not going to accept that.
[01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:16.671]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:50:16.691 --> 01:50:18.613]  Let me just say something about it.
[01:50:19.153 --> 01:50:22.295]  Right before the 2004 election, U.S.
[01:50:22.355 --> 01:50:31.783]  News and World Report quoted a White House source, high level, Dick Cheney, as saying that a nuke would go off before the election.
[01:50:32.463 --> 01:50:36.004]  There would be a terrorist attack, and they're constantly yelling fire in the theater.
[01:50:36.324 --> 01:50:40.445]  It came out they were quote, issuing fake terror alerts for political gain.
[01:50:41.365 --> 01:50:42.365]  That's all admitted now.
[01:50:42.965 --> 01:50:43.806]  But again, back of the paper.
[01:50:44.046 --> 01:50:44.646]  Totally admitted.
[01:50:44.966 --> 01:50:45.586]  Totally criminal.
[01:50:48.227 --> 01:50:50.427]  I didn't issue a warning for all of those.
[01:50:50.647 --> 01:50:52.088]  I said they're just fear mongering.
[01:50:52.168 --> 01:51:00.330]  Now there's this confluence of so many different things that I see it as a prime time for it to happen.
[01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:01.970]  It may happen next September.
[01:51:02.868 --> 01:51:04.370]  It may happen next October.
[01:51:05.391 --> 01:51:07.112]  It may happen the next September.
[01:51:08.153 --> 01:51:09.395]  It could happen anytime.
[01:51:11.156 --> 01:51:11.617]  Anytime.
[01:51:12.658 --> 01:51:24.309]  The point is that we have never since 9-11 had more of the key indicators I see, the light bulbs, the switches going off, the buzzers going off, that tell me we're in great danger.
[01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:27.232]  Okay, so I've issued my second prediction.
[01:51:29.448 --> 01:51:45.736]  But the prediction is if we don't have a monumental effort, if there's a revelation of government involvement, and since then there's been a new poll, even more people believe it's an inside job on MSNBC, about 61% now, if we cause an even bigger revelation, they can't get away with this.
[01:51:46.457 --> 01:51:47.117]  And we're doing that!
[01:51:48.018 --> 01:51:50.599]  But I don't want to at the same time get on the air and go, hey we're winning!
[01:51:50.639 --> 01:51:52.100]  You guys really got the word out!
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.201]  Fox News covered my prediction!
[01:51:54.221 --> 01:51:56.362]  You know, it's been in the newspaper!
[01:51:56.682 --> 01:51:57.943]  They may back off now!
[01:51:58.661 --> 01:52:01.002]  Because I still think they're probably going to pull something.
[01:52:02.203 --> 01:52:02.543]  Okay?
[01:52:02.704 --> 01:52:03.344]  But we'll see.
[01:52:03.424 --> 01:52:04.244]  Just keep pushing.
[01:52:05.265 --> 01:52:10.488]  And of course Fox News is probably setting me up after October passes and thank God there's no attack.
[01:52:10.528 --> 01:52:15.431]  And I said this back when I predicted that then they'll misquote my prediction and say, he said it would happen.
[01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:19.594]  He said Bush would launch an attack for sure against America and it didn't happen.
[01:52:20.714 --> 01:52:22.215]  Again, that's a straw man argument.
[01:52:22.916 --> 01:52:24.377]  I said unless we get the word out.
[01:52:25.857 --> 01:52:26.498]  Okay, there you go.
[01:52:27.285 --> 01:52:28.706]  And look, I was right last time.
[01:52:28.746 --> 01:52:29.407]  I don't like being right.
[01:52:29.447 --> 01:52:35.571]  I said, massive attack, probably on the World Trade Center, blaming it on the CIA asset, Bin Laden, unless we get the word out.
[01:52:35.852 --> 01:52:37.132]  And I said, it'll be in the next few months.
[01:52:37.733 --> 01:52:54.425]  And two weeks after I did that, Dr. Tania Kharaznia, the Chief Economist of Putin and Russia, said that the Deadhead Group, translated into English, the Skull and Bones Group, will launch an attack on the Economic Center in New York, that's all she said, as a way to bring in world government.
[01:52:54.986 --> 01:52:56.247]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[01:52:58.189 --> 01:53:00.271]  Let's talk to Don in Texas.
[01:53:00.311 --> 01:53:00.911]  Don, welcome.
[01:53:01.391 --> 01:53:01.872]  Oh, hi there.
[01:53:02.152 --> 01:53:02.452]  Hello.
[01:53:02.712 --> 01:53:03.393]  Yeah.
[01:53:03.473 --> 01:53:08.016]  Say, you know, there's been a rash of school shootings and strange anomalies.
[01:53:08.056 --> 01:53:08.897]  Totally staged.
[01:53:09.357 --> 01:53:09.958]  Well, certainly.
[01:53:09.998 --> 01:53:11.199]  Targeting young girls, yeah.
[01:53:12.059 --> 01:53:16.563]  You don't have a lot of chemical engineering background, but there's a lot of drugs.
[01:53:16.583 --> 01:53:17.784]  You've heard of Rohypnol.
[01:53:18.004 --> 01:53:23.108]  That's a drug that can influence the mind to where you become suggestible.
[01:53:23.588 --> 01:53:26.010]  And a lot of people, even 35 years, 40 years ago,
[01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:35.503]  There were drugs that hypnotists used to induce their patients to, you know, succumb to hypnosis.
[01:53:35.743 --> 01:53:38.804]  Yeah, there's amnesiacs and there's... Right.
[01:53:39.444 --> 01:53:42.345]  Yeah, that would be pharmakia, sir, not chemical engineering.
[01:53:42.405 --> 01:53:46.626]  Well, it... And I actually have quite a knowledge, I mean... It branches off, it branches off.
[01:53:46.706 --> 01:53:48.707]  Let me just add something since you made a statement.
[01:53:49.067 --> 01:53:50.167]  No, no, hold on a minute, sir.
[01:53:50.207 --> 01:53:51.888]  I'm going to make a statement since you made a statement.
[01:53:52.612 --> 01:53:55.614]  I don't know as much as a pharmacist or as much as a doctor.
[01:53:55.754 --> 01:53:57.075]  I know nothing compared to them.
[01:53:57.696 --> 01:54:02.759]  But actually, to make the statement that I don't know about Pharmakeia, I would say more than the average.
[01:54:02.799 --> 01:54:03.980]  But it doesn't matter what I know.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:04.881]  Just go ahead.
[01:54:04.901 --> 01:54:05.881]  Okay.
[01:54:06.462 --> 01:54:10.425]  Well, anyway, there's been 50 years for research to have been done.
[01:54:10.805 --> 01:54:13.267]  And of course, you don't like to knock Israel.
[01:54:13.667 --> 01:54:17.429]  But they're one of the primary people in... That's another false statement.
[01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:18.630]  Go ahead and put him on hold again.
[01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:20.832]  Another false statement, sir.
[01:54:21.767 --> 01:54:24.329]  And I'm confused by your false statements.
[01:54:25.289 --> 01:54:38.819]  All the people who do nothing but Jew bash all day and foam at the mouth and say that Jews make the rain not fall and Jews do this and that and Jews drink blood and all the rest of it and Jews are secretly werewolves and have hair on the bottom of their feet and all that.
[01:54:39.459 --> 01:54:41.120]  They're not listed by the ADL.
[01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:42.081]  I am.
[01:54:43.268 --> 01:54:44.869]  Because I hurt the New World Order.
[01:54:44.969 --> 01:54:46.110]  And I don't like the ADL.
[01:54:46.150 --> 01:54:48.532]  I don't like the Jewish Mafia out of Israel.
[01:54:48.932 --> 01:54:50.714]  I talk about the slave brothels in Israel.
[01:54:51.054 --> 01:54:55.798]  I talk about the Israeli lobby having a lot of power and blackmailing people in D.C.
[01:54:56.118 --> 01:55:02.103]  I talk about Israel controlling our caller ID systems and our government's phone security.
[01:55:02.583 --> 01:55:07.687]  I talk about Odigo, instant message service warning Israelis to get out of the buildings.
[01:55:08.147 --> 01:55:09.068]  I do all of that.
[01:55:09.128 --> 01:55:11.350]  I just don't do it from an anti-Semitic point of view.
[01:55:12.096 --> 01:55:13.997]  Because I criticize the corrupt British government.
[01:55:14.037 --> 01:55:14.998]  I'm not anti-British.
[01:55:15.578 --> 01:55:17.540]  I criticize the corrupt Chinese government.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:18.640]  I'm not anti-Asian.
[01:55:44.497 --> 01:55:46.438]  Well, no, I wouldn't do it.
[01:55:46.638 --> 01:55:48.839]  There are some Jewish people I've known that are just lovely.
[01:55:49.139 --> 01:55:54.121]  I've known some crypto guys, that's people that... Let me guess, I'm a crypto Jew?
[01:55:54.502 --> 01:55:54.942]  No, no, no.
[01:55:55.242 --> 01:55:58.143]  When I say crypto, that were people back during the Cold War.
[01:55:58.203 --> 01:55:58.643]  Yeah, I know.
[01:55:58.663 --> 01:56:01.985]  People who weren't Jewish who said... Loyal American, can I speak?
[01:56:03.086 --> 01:56:03.626]  Can I speak?
[01:56:03.866 --> 01:56:04.887]  Sure, go ahead and speak, sir.
[01:56:04.907 --> 01:56:06.147]  Tell us all about the Crypto Jews.
[01:56:06.167 --> 01:56:06.568]  They're everywhere.
[01:56:06.588 --> 01:56:09.829]  Well, they were working in what they call the Cryptology.
[01:56:09.889 --> 01:56:13.891]  They were people helping the American government in the Cold War.
[01:56:14.491 --> 01:56:19.213]  And they were very fine, wonderful people, and very nice and well, gracious people.
[01:56:19.874 --> 01:56:22.815]  Not all Christians are good, not all Christians are bad.
[01:56:23.415 --> 01:56:23.755]  Are you there?
[01:56:23.775 --> 01:56:25.596]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.616 --> 01:56:25.856]  Okay.
[01:56:26.437 --> 01:56:29.058]  Now, all I'm saying is, a lot of people don't know,
[01:56:29.676 --> 01:56:57.047]  that uh... a lot of these shootings now and maybe it wasn't uh... i'm sorry i didn't shouldn't set israel but whatever group it is if they have access to these drugs they can induce people you don't need a torture room or or or enslave them or anything you can use these drugs to make them do things according to the people that are what i call it no i know it's it's it's actually quite easy to uh... i call them the steering wheel people the people that want to control
[01:56:57.776 --> 01:57:02.060]  There's stuff like Halcyon.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:04.802]  There's a lot of drugs you can use.
[01:57:04.862 --> 01:57:06.203]  President Bush took that, didn't he?
[01:57:07.404 --> 01:57:09.165]  I wasn't aware he was on Halcyon.
[01:57:09.205 --> 01:57:11.407]  He went over to Japan.
[01:57:11.527 --> 01:57:11.928]  That's right.
[01:57:11.948 --> 01:57:13.909]  When he was vomiting on everyone, he was on Halcyon.
[01:57:13.929 --> 01:57:15.030]  That induces amnesia.
[01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:16.011]  Can I speak anymore?
[01:57:19.133 --> 01:57:19.953]  No, I'm going to let you go.
[01:57:19.973 --> 01:57:22.714]  I said I was going to go to callers quickly and I'm going to do that.
[01:57:22.734 --> 01:57:27.576]  That little preface thing about being able to speak to is... You've got plenty of time there, Don.
[01:57:28.116 --> 01:57:30.757]  Hey, if you don't like the show, don't tune in or listen to it, okay?
[01:57:31.517 --> 01:57:31.978]  Thanks a lot.

[01:57:33.578 --> 01:57:35.679]  Again, if you don't want to listen, don't listen.

[01:58:40.333 --> 01:58:46.536]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:58:46.996 --> 01:58:54.780]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:03.004]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:59:03.284 --> 01:59:08.046]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:59:08.366 --> 01:59:13.091]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:59:13.591 --> 01:59:17.455]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:45.743]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:00:45.983 --> 02:00:47.744]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:00:48.004 --> 02:00:54.288]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:00:54.588 --> 02:01:00.711]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:01:00.951 --> 02:01:02.792]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:01:02.932 --> 02:01:03.492]  I think so.
[02:01:25.564 --> 02:01:26.585]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:29.208]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:01:29.408 --> 02:01:29.629]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:29.709]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:01:54.662 --> 02:01:55.903]  Yeah, I mean, I'll be frank with you folks.
[02:01:55.983 --> 02:02:11.140]  I just get sick of the cult-likeness, the self-righteousness of people when they call and they go, well, I know you don't like to talk about the Jews, and you're afraid, and I know you don't.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.521]  I'm just going, you know what, I'm sick of that.
[02:02:12.541 --> 02:02:16.105]  Why don't you just talk about the crimes that different groups are involved in instead of
[02:02:17.284 --> 02:02:18.444]  Literally, they get off on it.
[02:02:18.464 --> 02:02:20.625]  I hear these other talk shows, and that's all they talk about.
[02:02:20.665 --> 02:02:31.807]  They do no good, no activism, no action, no rallying the people, just constantly repeating the same word, which the ADL and others just love, because then it makes them look like victims, and they get what they want.
[02:02:32.287 --> 02:02:33.427]  I'm not giving you what you want.
[02:02:34.007 --> 02:02:34.708]  It's just like this.
[02:02:34.808 --> 02:02:35.848]  I have nothing against Hispanics.
[02:02:35.888 --> 02:02:36.888]  I love Hispanic folks.
[02:02:37.608 --> 02:02:42.149]  But I'm against a large percentage saying this is Mexico, and they're going to kill Whitey.
[02:02:42.794 --> 02:02:44.918]  It's not that I'm against Hispanics or I'm racist.
[02:02:45.318 --> 02:02:55.675]  A lot of those guys are racist and I'm calling them out and I have the courage to do it and go out in the middle of the 100 degree heat with a hundred other Texans and protest on Desi Sace Parade.
[02:02:56.096 --> 02:02:56.657]  I don't, you know...
[02:02:57.532 --> 02:02:58.932]  That's because I'm not a racist.
[02:02:58.992 --> 02:03:00.413]  I'm proud of what I'm doing.
[02:03:00.733 --> 02:03:02.453]  I'm out there standing up against racists.
[02:03:02.954 --> 02:03:05.934]  You didn't see the good old Klan boys out at that, did you?
[02:03:06.255 --> 02:03:13.537]  No, they're just giving each other Grand Supreme Wizard Awards and Cyclopsium Double Ruler Clusters.
[02:03:14.397 --> 02:03:15.117]  Give me a break.
[02:03:15.977 --> 02:03:19.478]  Let's go ahead and... I'm going to move quick, folks.
[02:03:19.498 --> 02:03:20.118]  I want to get to everybody.
[02:03:20.158 --> 02:03:21.939]  I promised I would and see I'm babbling.
[02:03:22.479 --> 02:03:24.500]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Texas.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:25.380]  James, you're on the air.
[02:03:27.034 --> 02:03:28.175]  Hello James, go ahead.
[02:03:29.556 --> 02:03:31.598]  Well, uh, Mr. Jones, may I speak?
[02:03:32.318 --> 02:03:33.239]  Yes, you may speak.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:34.720]  Alright.
[02:03:36.281 --> 02:03:37.922]  Rest in peace, Alex.
[02:03:40.144 --> 02:03:51.413]  Last night on CNN, Mr. demonically possessed ex-president and beautiful daughter, Dora, sorry Dora, just a fax, on CNN last night, to further expand on your guest's experience,
[02:03:52.071 --> 02:03:59.035]  At a football game, the ex was ordered to tell his son to, Mr. President, bring our troops home.
[02:03:59.415 --> 02:04:01.476]  He replied, quote unquote, exactly.
[02:04:02.297 --> 02:04:04.438]  And that was the Eisenhower cake, Alex.
[02:04:04.798 --> 02:04:05.319]  What happened?
[02:04:05.359 --> 02:04:05.939]  I mean, I'm dumb.
[02:04:05.959 --> 02:04:06.799]  I'm missing what you're saying.
[02:04:06.859 --> 02:04:07.280]  What happened?
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:15.644]  You didn't catch CNN last night, uh, the, uh, interview with, uh, Mr. Herbert and, uh, daughter Dora on her book?
[02:04:16.425 --> 02:04:16.725]  No.
[02:04:16.845 --> 02:04:19.066]  So, so, so what happened?
[02:04:20.027 --> 02:04:20.087]  Uh,
[02:04:20.967 --> 02:04:38.975]  Through the discussion, just like the experience your guest had about speaking to an official, only what happened to him didn't happen because this happened at a football game, and that's the icing on the cake.
[02:04:39.895 --> 02:04:42.096]  Again, I'm totally stupid.
[02:04:42.136 --> 02:04:42.657]  What happened?
[02:04:42.697 --> 02:04:44.538]  Bush Seniors at a football game, what happened?
[02:04:44.818 --> 02:04:49.980]  He was telling a story that when he was at a football game, this big, burly man walked
[02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:59.378]  Uh, when Mr. President walked past him, the big birdy man told Mr. President to bring our troops home.
[02:04:59.779 --> 02:05:01.240]  Okay, and what happened?
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:02.722]  And that was the extent of it.
[02:05:03.122 --> 02:05:04.523]  There was no arrest, no nothing.
[02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:05.985]  Why do you think Bush Jr.
[02:05:06.005 --> 02:05:06.766]  was telling that story?
[02:05:07.767 --> 02:05:11.791]  Uh, well, he's just trying to prompt people to do what that last guy did.
[02:05:11.811 --> 02:05:13.753]  Go out there and try to
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.764]  Foul-mouthed an official, a dignitary, on the fly and get himself in hot water.
[02:05:21.284 --> 02:05:26.487]  Well, actually the earlier caller didn't foul-mouth a dignitary or an official or an excellency.
[02:05:26.807 --> 02:05:32.831]  He went to a public servant and told him that the war was despicable, reprehensible.
[02:05:33.471 --> 02:05:33.691]  Right.
[02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:35.092]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:05:35.132 --> 02:05:36.493]  Thank you so much for it, James.
[02:05:36.773 --> 02:05:37.573]  Call back again.
[02:05:37.934 --> 02:05:39.434]  Let's talk to Steve in Kentucky.
[02:05:39.474 --> 02:05:40.215]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:05:40.235 --> 02:05:41.216]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:41.296 --> 02:05:43.657]  I just wanted to say first that I'm a huge fan and
[02:05:44.082 --> 02:05:45.743]  Thank you so much for everything that you do.
[02:05:45.804 --> 02:05:46.304]  Thank you, sir.
[02:05:46.324 --> 02:05:46.964]  What's on your mind?
[02:05:47.185 --> 02:06:02.117]  I just wanted to let you know that here in Kentucky, the Department for Natural Resource Officers, they are training at Fort Knox, learning how to use MSTC teams from the back of a speeding boat onto the targets.
[02:06:02.357 --> 02:06:05.020]  Yeah, everything is about oppressing the American people.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:10.684]  Everything is about the government building control grids to track us down, to control us and kill us.
[02:06:11.085 --> 02:06:12.306]  The government's gone rogue.
[02:06:13.152 --> 02:06:15.875]  I see it coming like a speeding freight train at us, Alex.
[02:06:15.895 --> 02:06:18.257]  It's got me scared, but... Well, good luck.
[02:06:18.378 --> 02:06:21.461]  I mean, all the scum they've got working for them are a bunch of pushovers.
[02:06:21.981 --> 02:06:22.762]  God bless, Alex.
[02:06:22.882 --> 02:06:23.703]  Anything else on your mind?
[02:06:23.843 --> 02:06:24.224]  No, sir.
[02:06:24.404 --> 02:06:25.305]  Thank you for the call.
[02:06:25.765 --> 02:06:29.169]  I'd like to see that news article or a piece on that, but I am aware of those type of activities.
[02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:30.010]  Thank you so much.
[02:06:30.886 --> 02:06:33.628]  Let's go to David in Puerto Rico.
[02:06:34.049 --> 02:06:34.789]  Welcome, David.
[02:06:35.029 --> 02:06:35.409]  Hi, Dave.
[02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:35.890]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:36.590]  How are you doing, man?
[02:06:36.650 --> 02:06:36.770]  Good.
[02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:37.951]  I'll hold you over if you don't have time.
[02:06:37.971 --> 02:06:38.151]  Go ahead.
[02:06:38.171 --> 02:06:39.152]  I just want to give you a compliment.
[02:06:39.192 --> 02:06:40.093]  I live in Puerto Rico, man.
[02:06:40.133 --> 02:06:47.998]  I just want to say we saw your Tennis Storm video, but we saw, we showed it to an auditorium classroom in Spanish, and it came out to be great, man.
[02:06:48.018 --> 02:06:48.939]  You know what I mean?
[02:06:48.959 --> 02:06:52.501]  You know, it's a wake-up call, what you did for basically for the people here in the island.
[02:06:52.982 --> 02:06:53.522]  Oh, thank you.
[02:06:53.562 --> 02:06:55.023]  So somebody put Spanish to it?
[02:06:55.143 --> 02:06:56.244]  Yeah, we put Spanish to it.
[02:06:56.264 --> 02:07:00.127]  A lot of, you know, we transferred your voiceovers in Spanish.
[02:07:00.678 --> 02:07:06.119]  Well, if somebody would do a Spanish translation and put it on Google or send it to us, we'd put it on Google.
[02:07:06.139 --> 02:07:06.819]  That'd be wonderful.
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:07.580]  It's great, man.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.920]  You know what I mean?
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:10.440]  It's very great.
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:10.780]  Stay there.
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:12.321]  I want to hear more about this on the other side.
[02:07:12.361 --> 02:07:12.941]  Okay, David?
[02:07:13.761 --> 02:07:15.442]  We're going to come back to David in Puerto Rico.
[02:07:15.482 --> 02:07:16.142]  Don't hang up, David.
[02:07:16.582 --> 02:07:20.083]  We're going to go to everybody else.
[02:07:20.103 --> 02:07:20.343]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:07:20.363 --> 02:07:21.403]  All of you are great callers.
[02:07:21.803 --> 02:07:23.383]  We're having to move quick so we can get everybody in.
[02:07:23.403 --> 02:07:25.364]  We've got several news reports coming up as well.
[02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:25.824]  Stay with us.
[02:07:30.606 --> 02:07:33.594]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:07:34.536 --> 02:07:37.222]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:08:14.102 --> 02:08:16.023]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:08:16.724 --> 02:08:19.905]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:08:20.546 --> 02:08:27.029]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[02:08:30.851 --> 02:08:32.291]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:08:40.413 --> 02:08:42.253]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:08:42.573 --> 02:08:44.114]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:08:44.514 --> 02:08:44.774]  What?
[02:08:45.134 --> 02:08:45.474]  Again?
[02:08:45.914 --> 02:08:47.535]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:08:47.595 --> 02:08:52.015]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:08:52.256 --> 02:08:53.536]  Why did you do that?
[02:08:53.756 --> 02:08:59.537]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:08:59.857 --> 02:09:00.877]  Are we there yet?
[02:09:00.977 --> 02:09:02.058]  for the entire trip.
[02:09:02.298 --> 02:09:04.498]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:09:04.978 --> 02:09:05.998]  Great idea.
[02:09:06.278 --> 02:09:08.759]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:09:09.218 --> 02:09:11.703]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:09:11.883 --> 02:09:16.292]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:09:16.572 --> 02:09:16.873]  Honey!
[02:09:17.697 --> 02:09:18.938]  You're terrific!
[02:09:19.338 --> 02:09:20.798]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:09:20.938 --> 02:09:24.340]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:25.421]  Now can we stop?
[02:09:25.921 --> 02:09:26.641]  I need to go, too.
[02:09:26.941 --> 02:09:31.383]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:09:31.443 --> 02:09:31.743]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:09:31.783 --> 02:09:33.344]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:09:40.367 --> 02:09:42.530]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[02:09:42.951 --> 02:09:49.539]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[02:09:49.819 --> 02:09:56.208]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the Mystery Schools long before the Messiah was born.
[02:09:56.568 --> 02:10:01.130]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts, the worship of pagan gods prevailed.
[02:10:01.410 --> 02:10:06.852]  The Church's sacred cannibalism service, known as Communion, is based upon words the Messiah never said.
[02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:08.433]  The Savior was no cannibal.
[02:10:08.693 --> 02:10:09.853]  He lived and taught the Torah.
[02:10:10.173 --> 02:10:10.673]  See proof?
[02:10:10.934 --> 02:10:11.454]  Get the book.
[02:10:11.674 --> 02:10:13.615]  Communion, the Bloodfest of Babylon today.
[02:10:13.935 --> 02:10:15.795]  Write to Two Witnesses Ministries, P.O.
[02:10:15.815 --> 02:10:16.716]  Box 2453, Abilene, Texas, 79604.
[02:10:16.756 --> 02:10:17.176]  Or call 325-572-3913.
[02:10:25.359 --> 02:10:30.363]  Yes, Gnostics did hijack Fante to fulfill their devious plan to make abomination look holy.
[02:10:30.563 --> 02:10:34.606]  Gnostic conspiracy exposed in Communion, Bloodfest of Babylon.
[02:10:34.827 --> 02:10:35.007]  Call 325-572-3913.
[02:10:51.911 --> 02:10:52.672]  Welcome back.
[02:10:52.732 --> 02:10:54.453]  On this Friday edition, Ear Calls.
[02:10:54.493 --> 02:10:56.835]  Tons of news coming up here momentarily.
[02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:28.932]  You know, to think about it, there is a way out of here, and it's realizing that criminals have hijacked every level of government.
[02:11:28.952 --> 02:11:37.076]  They have useful idiots under them, following orders, and 90% of what you see is color of law.
[02:11:37.656 --> 02:11:39.557]  The courts are almost completely corrupt.
[02:11:40.257 --> 02:11:41.598]  We're like a rotting body.
[02:11:41.638 --> 02:11:47.760]  We're really getting to the bloated point where, I don't want to go into details, but it's getting bad.
[02:11:48.841 --> 02:11:49.601]  And people are starting to
[02:11:50.490 --> 02:11:51.030]  Smell something?
[02:11:51.851 --> 02:11:55.032]  Man, it's getting, you know, it's really starting to get obvious.
[02:11:55.072 --> 02:11:57.153]  People try to deny it for a while.
[02:11:57.173 --> 02:11:58.333]  Oh, the country's just asleep.
[02:11:58.393 --> 02:11:59.594]  Look at it sitting there in its chair.
[02:11:59.614 --> 02:12:01.375]  Oh, getting a little pale there.
[02:12:01.395 --> 02:12:02.775]  Getting a little stiff there, Bob.
[02:12:03.736 --> 02:12:09.038]  And now Bob's all swole up and black and got maggots and cockroaches all over it and the intestines have popped.
[02:12:10.091 --> 02:12:13.113]  There's like a soup dripping on the carpet, and we're still going, ha ha!
[02:12:13.574 --> 02:12:16.235]  Listen to these conspiracy theorists say the country's dead!
[02:12:16.336 --> 02:12:16.876]  Ha ha ha!
[02:12:17.677 --> 02:12:21.579]  It'll be a skeleton before you know it, and they'll go, look, it's vibrant!
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:23.841]  It's a babe in a manger!
[02:12:23.861 --> 02:12:28.484]  I just want to get our country back, folks.
[02:12:30.105 --> 02:12:31.807]  And, uh, but hey, yuppies just...
[02:12:32.759 --> 02:12:40.223]  Yuppies don't understand that if they save the country, they won't bankrupt the dollar, they won't blow out the economy, they won't do all these things they're planning if we back them off.
[02:12:40.564 --> 02:12:44.086]  See, they gotta have the police state in place first before they have all this fun with us!
[02:12:44.746 --> 02:12:47.308]  But I know you're gonna deny it and just let them have the fun.
[02:12:47.628 --> 02:12:53.311]  And a lot of you'll get to be functionaries in the system and you'll get to, you know, still believe the propaganda.
[02:12:53.371 --> 02:12:54.512]  It's fun, I know.
[02:12:54.852 --> 02:12:59.055]  Your parents were probably scum and they were scum before you and scum on down the line.
[02:12:59.595 --> 02:13:01.236]  That's the age of scum, so...
[02:13:03.419 --> 02:13:04.221]  I'm out of control.
[02:13:04.241 --> 02:13:05.143]  I understand that.
[02:13:05.163 --> 02:13:07.167]  We've got calls from Japan, Australia, everywhere.
[02:13:07.187 --> 02:13:08.450]  But let's go back to Puerto Rico.
[02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:10.555]  To David first.
[02:13:11.397 --> 02:13:12.699]  Then we have a little closer to field.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:14.123]  Texas and Kentucky again.
[02:13:15.258 --> 02:13:18.240]  But, go ahead, you're on the air, David.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:19.840]  Very exciting!
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:24.683]  So, there in Puerto Rico, is this college or high school, or where are you showing Terror Storm?
[02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:28.545]  We're showing it at an oil tournament at a college.
[02:13:28.705 --> 02:13:29.265]  You're showing it.
[02:13:29.525 --> 02:13:29.905]  Oh, good.
[02:13:29.965 --> 02:13:33.627]  So, does somebody live get up and talk over my voiceover, or what happens?
[02:13:33.647 --> 02:13:35.988]  Basically, well, a friend of mine works there.
[02:13:36.008 --> 02:13:38.589]  He does audio tech.
[02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:41.711]  He took your video and transformed it into a Spanish language.
[02:13:42.288 --> 02:13:48.813]  Okay, your buddy took my video and dumped Spanish over it and uploaded it.
[02:13:48.853 --> 02:13:51.696]  He used some sort of, I don't know what he did, but it came out great.
[02:13:51.836 --> 02:14:04.846]  No, what I'm saying is, ask him to burn me a disc of it, mail it to me, and I'll upload it to Google for free, so that the, what is it, a billion, or like 800 million or something, know how to speak Spanish or some ridiculous number?
[02:14:04.866 --> 02:14:07.929]  Yeah, you're talking to one right here that speaks Spanish perfectly well, Alex.
[02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.910]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:10.291]  We need to get that out to the right people.
[02:14:10.311 --> 02:14:10.671]  That's so cool.
[02:14:10.951 --> 02:14:14.034]  No, but at one time I thought you were just crazy about it.
[02:14:14.074 --> 02:14:15.355]  Some sort of white guy that launched it.
[02:14:15.375 --> 02:14:16.816]  But yo, you really woke me up, man.
[02:14:17.476 --> 02:14:19.178]  You really woke me up with what you were saying, man.
[02:14:19.218 --> 02:14:22.320]  I mean, I thought you were some sort of pathetic, crazy cat.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:23.181]  This guy's on TV.
[02:14:23.201 --> 02:14:23.982]  He said, nah, man.
[02:14:24.582 --> 02:14:27.164]  This guy really blew my mind with what he was saying, man.
[02:14:27.184 --> 02:14:34.290]  He said, yo, I was checking you out and I thought you were just some sort of lunatic on national radio.
[02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:36.591]  I said, whoa, this guy, he's the real deal.
[02:14:36.611 --> 02:14:37.212]  What are you saying?
[02:14:37.813 --> 02:14:40.274]  You really humble me, man.
[02:14:40.374 --> 02:14:43.334]  I'm a Hispanic man.
[02:14:43.594 --> 02:14:45.075]  I'm a black person.
[02:14:45.115 --> 02:14:51.456]  I don't really compliment people, but you really put a sledgehammer in my head and really woke me up with what you're saying, man.
[02:14:51.696 --> 02:14:52.676]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[02:14:52.716 --> 02:14:55.517]  We're all brothers and sisters together in this fight.
[02:14:55.557 --> 02:15:00.738]  But listen, it is so important that whoever translates Terror Storm into Spanish
[02:15:01.238 --> 02:15:04.459]  I mean in Puerto Rico a lot of people don't see what's going on in our school.
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:30.504]  We have a lot of stickers of Infowars.com on our bulletin boards.
[02:15:30.524 --> 02:15:31.104]  Oh, awesome.
[02:15:31.325 --> 02:15:36.310]  We see, man, you know, and people, you know, and say, you know, that's all, what's happening in the States is different.
[02:15:36.330 --> 02:15:37.712]  I don't see that happening in the island.
[02:15:38.073 --> 02:15:39.534]  Everything is okay here in the Caribbean.
[02:15:39.574 --> 02:15:41.537]  Well, I don't know about that, because it's starting to see
[02:15:42.441 --> 02:15:45.082]  They're building up prisons around certain parts of the island.
[02:15:45.142 --> 02:15:49.063]  I said, whoa, is Halliburton coming down here putting up concentration camps?
[02:15:49.083 --> 02:15:50.444]  We all saw people kind of curious.
[02:15:50.904 --> 02:15:51.944]  Well, they are, sure.
[02:15:51.984 --> 02:15:55.285]  We've got more prisons than anybody in the world, and they're only building more.
[02:15:55.305 --> 02:15:56.486]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:15:56.526 --> 02:15:57.726]  I was like, you know, it's kind of curious.
[02:15:57.746 --> 02:16:04.048]  Everyone's thinking, you know, that the Caribbean is safer from where you at in the mainland, in Texas, or California, or Arizona, or Mexico.
[02:16:04.328 --> 02:16:09.550]  Even the problems you have with the Mexicans out there, they figure that conflict won't come out here in another part of the country.
[02:16:10.595 --> 02:16:12.317]  Well, they're playing us off against each other.
[02:16:12.337 --> 02:16:13.538]  We've all got to come together.
[02:16:14.479 --> 02:16:15.320]  Same thing with Mexico.
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:17.383]  But what you're saying is very exciting.
[02:16:17.763 --> 02:16:19.505]  And again, please contact your friend.
[02:16:19.666 --> 02:16:21.468]  Beg him to upload it to Google.
[02:16:21.588 --> 02:16:22.329]  I'll speak to him.
[02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:24.732]  Is there a way I can email you?
[02:16:26.253 --> 02:16:29.115]  Well, if he uploads it and gives us a link, that's fine.
[02:16:29.135 --> 02:16:38.980]  He can upload it to Google, or you can contact us at Aaron at InfoWars.com, or Kevin at InfoWars.com, or Mike at InfoWars.com.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.562]  I'm just giving you all my people's email, that way it's all broken up, so one person doesn't get all the email.
[02:16:43.582 --> 02:16:44.703]  We all try to read it together.
[02:16:44.723 --> 02:16:45.663]  Cool.
[02:16:45.843 --> 02:16:52.687]  But just tell your friend, please, if he doesn't know how to upload it to Google, mail me a disc of it, and I will get it up on Google Video.
[02:16:52.887 --> 02:16:55.028]  Hey man, it's a pleasure speaking to you for the first time, man.
[02:16:55.148 --> 02:16:56.489]  Hey, pleasure talking to you.
[02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:57.449]  It's a pleasure, man.
[02:16:57.529 --> 02:16:58.850]  It's a blessing speaking to you, man.
[02:16:59.090 --> 02:17:01.591]  It's a blessing talking to you, and Godspeed, my brother.
[02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:03.052]  And I'll say this.
[02:17:03.852 --> 02:17:08.614]  We're all in this together, and the power of whoever it is in Puerto Rico.
[02:17:08.634 --> 02:17:13.797]  I remember a couple, about three years ago, a guy called who said he was a professor in Puerto Rico.
[02:17:14.357 --> 02:17:15.918]  He was visiting family in Florida.
[02:17:16.753 --> 02:17:19.595]  And he said that he was teaching his students the truth.
[02:17:20.095 --> 02:17:25.099]  And I've gotten, over the years, since then, a bunch of calls from different students at that college.
[02:17:26.279 --> 02:17:29.321]  So, somebody's got to get this in Spanish.
[02:17:30.782 --> 02:17:33.965]  People keep asking me, do it in German, do it in Spanish, do it in French.
[02:17:34.565 --> 02:17:36.046]  Folks, I don't have that much money.
[02:17:37.547 --> 02:17:44.712]  And I don't have that much staff, or I don't have that much... If we had the money for more staff, I consider and tell everybody what to do.
[02:17:44.932 --> 02:17:46.453]  We don't have a corporate structure here.
[02:17:47.313 --> 02:17:47.874]  Please!
[02:17:49.255 --> 02:17:50.476]  Put it in Japanese!
[02:17:50.636 --> 02:17:51.156]  Please!
[02:17:51.236 --> 02:17:52.057]  Put it in Spanish!
[02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:53.398]  You want to do... I mean, Spanish!
[02:17:53.458 --> 02:17:54.699]  I mean, the Japanese are what?
[02:17:54.719 --> 02:17:55.499]  A hundred million?
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:02.805]  The Chinese are so many different dialects, but I guess if you did it in the main dialect, a billion and three hundred plus million.
[02:18:03.386 --> 02:18:04.867]  That's really the key group we need.
[02:18:04.907 --> 02:18:07.949]  But Spanish, it's like seven hundred, eight hundred million.
[02:18:08.009 --> 02:18:08.530]  I forget.
[02:18:08.610 --> 02:18:09.150]  Something like that.
[02:18:09.751 --> 02:18:12.112]  Yo, you're very receptive to the truth.
[02:18:12.173 --> 02:18:14.134]  Great people in Latin America and the Caribbean.
[02:18:14.695 --> 02:18:16.516]  We have got to get it to them!
[02:18:17.384 --> 02:18:20.086]  And I just... Listen, I'll get ten calls.
[02:18:20.186 --> 02:18:20.946]  Oh, I'm in Austin.
[02:18:20.966 --> 02:18:22.287]  Let me come to your office and do it.
[02:18:22.347 --> 02:18:24.309]  Folks, we're busy trying to make two more films right now.
[02:18:24.769 --> 02:18:26.310]  Please, just somebody do it!
[02:18:27.011 --> 02:18:27.971]  Somebody do it!
[02:18:27.991 --> 02:18:29.252]  I don't care if it's subtitles.
[02:18:29.332 --> 02:18:32.634]  Just... This is the kind of stuff I have nightmares about.
[02:18:33.315 --> 02:18:34.295]  I want to do more.
[02:18:34.335 --> 02:18:36.317]  That's all I think about is how to do more.
[02:18:38.518 --> 02:18:40.660]  If you'd just take action, there'd be no stopping us.
[02:18:42.061 --> 02:18:47.124]  If you would take action, whether you're Deutsch, or Russian, or Japanese, or Chinese, or Puerto Rican,
[02:18:47.802 --> 02:18:49.982]  Or, it doesn't matter, or you're in Newfoundland.
[02:18:50.703 --> 02:18:51.783]  It's up to you.
[02:18:51.963 --> 02:18:53.003]  Do the labor of love.
[02:18:53.123 --> 02:18:53.763]  Take action.
[02:18:53.923 --> 02:18:56.284]  If you don't know how to do a computer work, find somebody who does.
[02:18:56.544 --> 02:18:57.384]  Go out and get it done.
[02:18:57.404 --> 02:18:58.704]  I mean, this is life and death!
[02:19:00.424 --> 02:19:06.365]  You understand, folks, that I literally have trouble going to sleep every night now because I'm so worried about what's happening?
[02:19:07.166 --> 02:19:10.906]  And believe me, cowering in a hole is only ensuring you're going to go down.
[02:19:11.826 --> 02:19:13.267]  Let's kick their butts together.
[02:19:14.427 --> 02:19:14.947]  Please!
[02:19:15.985 --> 02:19:17.526]  Listen, Terror Storm in English.
[02:19:18.266 --> 02:19:19.427]  The world language.
[02:19:20.047 --> 02:19:21.527]  Three billion people speak English.
[02:19:21.548 --> 02:19:22.048]  Did you know that?
[02:19:22.168 --> 02:19:23.288]  Or have some English.
[02:19:24.069 --> 02:19:26.029]  Because of the radical actions of the British Empire.
[02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:28.611]  We can get it out to people that way.
[02:19:29.471 --> 02:19:31.712]  There's like twenty-something versions of Terror Storm.
[02:19:32.252 --> 02:19:33.853]  Look for the two or three that are high quality.
[02:19:35.351 --> 02:19:42.935]  And every time they hit 200,000, they knock out their view stats, because we've now counted up as over 4 million views in the last month and a half.
[02:19:42.975 --> 02:19:44.936]  They're cheating us for being in the top 100.
[02:19:45.036 --> 02:19:50.599]  We need your, because once it gets into Google Top 100, everybody else who's visiting Google starts seeing it.
[02:19:51.099 --> 02:19:54.101]  Millions of people, and then it really goes supernova.
[02:19:54.907 --> 02:19:55.348]  Help us!
[02:19:55.528 --> 02:19:57.710]  Go get TerrorStorm off Google Video.
[02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:58.931]  Put it on MySpace.
[02:19:59.492 --> 02:20:00.393]  Post the links.
[02:20:00.913 --> 02:20:02.035]  All over message boards.
[02:20:02.115 --> 02:20:03.656]  ABC News message boards.
[02:20:03.736 --> 02:20:04.898]  Limbaugh message boards.
[02:20:05.238 --> 02:20:06.479]  Hannity message boards.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.602]  Democrat message boards.
[02:20:08.662 --> 02:20:10.103]  IndyMedia message boards.
[02:20:11.565 --> 02:20:12.766]  Google message boards.
[02:20:12.866 --> 02:20:14.127]  Yahoo message boards.
[02:20:14.488 --> 02:20:15.109]  TerrorStorm!
[02:20:15.149 --> 02:20:15.749]  TerrorStorm!
[02:20:15.789 --> 02:20:16.350]  TerrorStorm!
[02:20:17.458 --> 02:20:19.380]  It is having a huge effect already.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:20.921]  This film is so important.
[02:20:21.501 --> 02:20:26.045]  It's irrefutable facts of 7-7, 9-11, Iraq, all of it.
[02:20:26.165 --> 02:20:28.026]  It needs to be seen.
[02:20:30.428 --> 02:20:32.330]  Very exciting, getting that call from Puerto Rico.
[02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:42.378]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Andrew in Japan, then John in Australia, then we'll go to Stephen, Kentucky and others.
[02:20:42.418 --> 02:20:43.899]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[02:20:45.376 --> 02:20:45.836]  Hi, Alex.
[02:20:45.976 --> 02:20:46.917]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:20:47.097 --> 02:20:47.417]  Welcome.
[02:20:47.437 --> 02:20:49.119]  What are you doing in Japan?
[02:20:50.499 --> 02:20:51.480]  I'm a teacher out here.
[02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:52.241]  Oh, cool.
[02:20:52.261 --> 02:20:53.281]  Well, thank you for calling in.
[02:20:53.301 --> 02:20:53.942]  What's on your mind?
[02:20:54.802 --> 02:20:56.003]  Oh, thanks for taking my call.
[02:20:56.223 --> 02:21:05.349]  It's just funny that you just mentioned Google because I was actually kicked off of their question and answer board for asking questions about 9-11.
[02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:06.730]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:06.890 --> 02:21:08.271]  There's massive censorship.
[02:21:08.311 --> 02:21:10.132]  Google isn't just censoring in China.
[02:21:10.252 --> 02:21:12.494]  They're censoring globally, and I'm mad about it.
[02:21:13.744 --> 02:21:15.466]  Because they claim they aren't!
[02:21:15.746 --> 02:21:16.727]  They claim they aren't!
[02:21:16.747 --> 02:21:18.969]  It was a big scandal when they did it in China.
[02:21:19.229 --> 02:21:21.051]  Now they're doing it here and I'm mad.
[02:21:21.191 --> 02:21:21.531]  Sorry.
[02:21:22.672 --> 02:21:26.836]  Anyone who has them as their home page, I'd advise you to change your home page.
[02:21:27.156 --> 02:21:37.065]  And I know you have a link to send them a protest email telling them that you're not going to use their services anymore if they're going to be censors like that.
[02:21:37.495 --> 02:21:41.379]  Well, they're a great system because they've got NSA technology, and they are the best search engine.
[02:21:41.399 --> 02:21:42.580]  They've got a lot of great features.
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:43.761]  I love Google.
[02:21:43.981 --> 02:21:45.502]  That's why I'm particularly mad.
[02:21:45.522 --> 02:21:47.984]  Well, they must be scared of TerrorStorm.
[02:21:48.004 --> 02:21:50.266]  Why do you think they've erased our stats at least twice?
[02:21:50.287 --> 02:21:52.408]  I know.
[02:21:52.769 --> 02:21:56.512]  I actually noticed that before you posted it on InfoWars.
[02:21:56.592 --> 02:22:00.756]  I was mad, but I was sure you were going to say something about it, and I'm glad you did.
[02:22:02.127 --> 02:22:14.450]  I just wanted to say that as far as the Canadian situation, because I'm a native of Canada, that the only reason why it would be really important to get Terror Storm out in French is that we've got a really large French population in Canada.
[02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:15.511]  Actually, I'm French.
[02:22:16.031 --> 02:22:20.512]  And they're really patriotic, and they love their country.
[02:22:20.592 --> 02:22:27.394]  So anyone who's trying to get Terror Storm into Canada, just use the Google video link, or you can just
[02:22:28.058 --> 02:22:39.590]  Mail the DVDs out in an envelope that doesn't identify it as Terror Storm or... Yeah, Canada, again, Japan, China, Russia, no problem getting stuff in.
[02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:43.855]  Canada, literally folks, I'm not trying to bash Canada, great people, I've got a lot of friends that are Canadian.
[02:22:44.155 --> 02:22:46.858]  Canadians don't know how bad your government is, man, they're bad!
[02:22:47.158 --> 02:22:48.460]  And I've been hearing about them for years!
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:55.864]  Oh, they're bad, and we're all brainwashed into believing that the monarchy has absolutely no power, but... Oh, they own the whole thing!
[02:22:55.904 --> 02:23:03.249]  ...we've got our money, and, you know, I'm out looking at my passport right now, and on the top of our Canadian logo, there's a crown.
[02:23:03.509 --> 02:23:04.650]  I mean, that speaks volumes.
[02:23:04.690 --> 02:23:07.172]  Well, she owns about 40% of the land there.
[02:23:07.192 --> 02:23:08.592]  She owns the roads.
[02:23:08.693 --> 02:23:09.613]  She owns everything.
[02:23:10.414 --> 02:23:13.856]  Yeah, I know, but she just comes there every year, and we put on the little...
[02:23:15.302 --> 02:23:21.965]  That piece of trash lowly scum pig, royal scum thinking she rules us, that filth.
[02:23:22.885 --> 02:23:23.185]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:23.205 --> 02:23:24.106]  Are you talking about Harper?
[02:23:24.646 --> 02:23:26.287]  No, I'm talking about Queen Elizabeth.
[02:23:27.127 --> 02:23:30.048]  Sax Kobo's Gotha, that big hog.
[02:23:30.068 --> 02:23:33.250]  That Nazi piece of trash.
[02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:36.411]  I got a chance to see Skinner darkly, Alex.
[02:23:36.491 --> 02:23:38.332]  I loved your spot in that.
[02:23:38.652 --> 02:23:40.773]  Oh good, out in Japan, huh?
[02:23:41.994 --> 02:23:47.216]  Yeah, I managed to get my hands on a copy through alternative methods.
[02:23:47.456 --> 02:23:48.536]  Oh, those are everything.
[02:23:48.596 --> 02:23:49.337]  I thought it was great.
[02:23:50.157 --> 02:23:52.118]  Okay, listen, good to have you from Japan.
[02:23:52.698 --> 02:23:56.079]  Anything else?
[02:23:56.379 --> 02:23:59.701]  I'd like to hear more of these celebrities.
[02:23:59.741 --> 02:24:05.283]  They obviously support you, like the ones that were on Scanner Darkly and Sheen and all of them.
[02:24:05.323 --> 02:24:08.904]  So I'd just like to put out a challenge for more celebrities to come
[02:24:09.397 --> 02:24:13.859]  To come on your show and speak out against the New World Order.
[02:24:13.959 --> 02:24:15.400]  They saw the treatment Sheen got.
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:16.260]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:17.341 --> 02:24:19.122]  All total lies, folks, about him.
[02:24:19.762 --> 02:24:23.083]  John in Australia, and then we'll go to... Tom just hung up.
[02:24:23.103 --> 02:24:24.664]  We'll go to Ian and others.
[02:24:24.904 --> 02:24:25.305]  Go ahead.
[02:24:27.065 --> 02:24:28.546]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:24:28.566 --> 02:24:29.126]  How you doing?
[02:24:29.346 --> 02:24:31.007]  How's stuff going down under, my friend?
[02:24:31.027 --> 02:24:32.868]  Not too bad.
[02:24:32.888 --> 02:24:35.649]  Just a few questions, I suppose you'd say.
[02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:38.371]  I've noticed that you seem to emphasize a lot of
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:45.802]  You know, like, God bless you, and so forth, on the radio, but when it comes to your DVDs and so forth, it's quite absent.
[02:24:46.562 --> 02:24:47.822]  Just curious as to why that is.
[02:24:47.842 --> 02:24:49.143]  I intend to emphasize what, sir?
[02:24:50.703 --> 02:24:52.204]  Um, Christianity.
[02:24:53.164 --> 02:24:54.684]  Just like with the comments like, God bless.
[02:24:54.844 --> 02:24:57.345]  Well, the films are focused about the issues.
[02:24:58.187 --> 02:25:00.588]  That they're in, you know, the context they're in.
[02:25:00.968 --> 02:25:16.795]  I'm a Christian, I'm from the Bible Belt, my family's Christian, I believe in Christian values, but I have to, but most Americans believe they're Christian and believe that means worshipping world government, worshipping open borders, worshipping war, and so I'm simply trying to explain that that's not really Christianity.
[02:25:18.315 --> 02:25:21.837]  Alright, but is that because the radio and DVDs are two different demographics?
[02:25:22.868 --> 02:25:24.850]  No, it's not something where it's demographics.
[02:25:24.890 --> 02:25:26.051]  I guess I never thought about it.
[02:25:26.071 --> 02:25:29.814]  I mean, in a film about government-sponsored terror, I'm focused.
[02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:35.299]  The films are two hours long, the radio shows three hours every day, you know, five days a week.
[02:25:35.319 --> 02:25:39.643]  Well, now I guess six days a week I'm doing radio, and then everything else I do.
[02:25:39.723 --> 02:25:50.232]  So this is more personal, this is more on-the-fly, this is more what I think, more editorializing, whereas the films are documentaries about certain subjects.
[02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:55.592]  But I did make a film about the occult, sir, and about the satanic nature of our elite.
[02:25:56.433 --> 02:26:06.818]  Yeah, you know, I've been listening for about six months, and I've just seen that there's a lot of people that are not... They come across as religious fanatics, you know?
[02:26:07.038 --> 02:26:07.739]  Yeah, well, you know what?
[02:26:07.779 --> 02:26:09.059]  That's fine.
[02:26:09.319 --> 02:26:10.620]  Well, let me just say this, sir.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:13.081]  You can judge... Go ahead.
[02:26:13.401 --> 02:26:17.063]  You can make mention of your own beliefs and so forth.
[02:26:17.223 --> 02:26:18.184]  It's all centered on...
[02:26:20.134 --> 02:26:24.576]  You know, on the real issues, when it comes to radio, it seems, you know, Bush is evil, Bush is that.
[02:26:25.636 --> 02:26:28.037]  You can't give a copy of Terror Storm to your friends.
[02:26:28.157 --> 02:26:32.499]  It's almost like a branding, like a form of marketing.
[02:26:33.099 --> 02:26:34.560]  Of course it's a form of marketing!
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:38.001]  I'm desperately trying to get the information out!
[02:26:38.061 --> 02:26:40.202]  But, I mean, what do you think we're trying to do here, sir?
[02:26:40.222 --> 02:26:41.162]  We're trying to survive!
[02:26:41.182 --> 02:26:45.264]  I mean, just to say marketing, you know, is it some corporate marketing?
[02:26:45.324 --> 02:26:46.705]  Is it a profit-driven marketing?
[02:26:46.725 --> 02:26:47.605]  No, it's the opposite!
[02:26:48.268 --> 02:26:51.451]  Since I started really going nuts and putting stuff out for free, I don't sell as much stuff.
[02:26:51.531 --> 02:26:52.091]  I don't care.
[02:26:54.153 --> 02:26:55.014]  That's the bottom line.
[02:26:55.054 --> 02:26:56.355]  It's about getting the info out.
[02:26:57.075 --> 02:27:04.121]  I understand that, but even when it does come to financial issues, you don't seem to go in-depth.
[02:27:04.201 --> 02:27:09.806]  I've heard you say previously, I probably won't even make any money off this film, but it sort of ends there.
[02:27:09.826 --> 02:27:12.088]  It doesn't actually go into detail about UMGCN.
[02:27:16.228 --> 02:27:23.034]  This is clearly a criticism, and it's a good criticism because it's calmly presented and laid out, but there's no substance to it.
[02:27:24.955 --> 02:27:27.538]  I'm a religious nut because I say I'm a Christian.
[02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:36.052]  Well listen, I know that Christianity is basically dead in England and basically dead in Australia.
[02:27:36.412 --> 02:27:39.774]  But the churches are still open here and people still have faith in this country.
[02:27:40.194 --> 02:27:42.276]  And I'm not ashamed of my Christianity.
[02:27:42.576 --> 02:27:44.197]  So if you think I'm a nut or a kook, fine.
[02:27:44.677 --> 02:27:46.598]  You should just judge my information.
[02:27:46.698 --> 02:27:48.239]  Am I right about 7-7, 9-11?
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.121]  Am I right about the lying about the Iraq War?
[02:27:51.362 --> 02:27:52.622]  Was I lying about spying?
[02:27:52.983 --> 02:27:54.984]  I've been telling people for 10 years they're spying on them.
[02:27:55.264 --> 02:27:56.525]  Was I lying about anything?
[02:27:56.625 --> 02:27:56.865]  No.
[02:27:57.285 --> 02:27:58.246]  I bear good fruit.
[02:27:58.746 --> 02:28:00.167]  Oh, another Christian statement.
[02:28:00.768 --> 02:28:01.728]  I'm telling the truth.
[02:28:01.949 --> 02:28:03.209]  I'm a good person, okay?
[02:28:03.850 --> 02:28:05.391]  I do this with an open heart.
[02:28:06.071 --> 02:28:08.413]  I come from a position of trying to do good.
[02:28:08.733 --> 02:28:09.694]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[02:28:10.074 --> 02:28:11.495]  So I'm confused by your call, sir.
[02:28:12.270 --> 02:28:13.732]  I am not trying to criticize you.
[02:28:14.032 --> 02:28:15.533]  Well, I think you're allowed to criticize me.
[02:28:15.553 --> 02:28:17.975]  If you just said you wanted to criticize, you'd go to the head of the line, my friend.
[02:28:19.817 --> 02:28:21.158]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say?
[02:28:21.178 --> 02:28:23.480]  Um, yeah.
[02:28:23.741 --> 02:28:29.486]  People like Charlie Sheen, with your, pretty much, uh, your warning... Stay there, stay there.
[02:28:29.506 --> 02:28:31.288]  When we get back there, you've got to speak a little louder.
[02:28:31.788 --> 02:28:36.052]  You're on an IP phone or something, and I mean, it's the dickens trying to hear you.
[02:28:43.465 --> 02:28:46.648]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:28:46.988 --> 02:28:48.910]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:28:49.310 --> 02:28:56.976]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:28:57.637 --> 02:29:04.702]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.

[02:32:45.113 --> 02:32:46.351]  I don't even understand that question.
[02:32:47.463 --> 02:32:48.364]  With my prediction?

[02:33:02.752 --> 02:33:05.874]  Charlie, you're criticizing him because he's already gotten up and been pilloried?
[02:33:06.455 --> 02:33:08.856]  So you're just nastily saying, why hasn't he done more?
[02:33:09.236 --> 02:33:10.117]  What does that even mean?

[02:33:32.925 --> 02:33:44.687]  Yes, I know who Dr. Warwick is and the rest of them and they say we will be made to take the chips or we'll be like the Amish and then we'll have our communities overtaken and it's the future, the hive brain.
[02:33:45.007 --> 02:33:45.908]  It's very dangerous.
[02:33:45.928 --> 02:33:49.708]  It's being sold as trendy and cutting edge and it's not.
[02:33:50.108 --> 02:33:51.509]  Yeah, what about post-humans?

[02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:57.790]  Yeah, scary.
[02:33:59.838 --> 02:34:06.761]  In fact, that's really what I'm into, what I'm really worried about, and that's what I should be talking about on this show, and I intend to make a whole film about the subject.
[02:34:07.021 --> 02:34:08.461]  In fact, it's in production right now.

[02:35:33.738 --> 02:35:34.498]  Tell me my thinking.
