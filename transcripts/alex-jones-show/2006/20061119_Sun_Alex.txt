[00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:19.312]  People of the day!
[00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:27.839]  Kurt Lewis and Melanie Johnson reporting.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.784]  One of the hostages has been identified as Paul Rubin, an American 39-year-old police officer.
[00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:40.449]  I think the great struggle we're going to have is between radicals and extremists versus people who want to live in peace.
[00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:45.596]  Sony Computer Entertainment President Kaz Hirai says there will be weekly shipments to try and meet U.S.
[00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.056]  demand.
[00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:51.644]  Our conference has come together with an appreciation for the opportunity to redefine who we are.
[00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:56.290]  As long as you have some fresh bread and you have some fresh ingredients in the fridge, throw it together any way you like.
[00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.568]  American hostages in Iraq.
[00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:03.110]  The President's APEC meetings in Vietnam.
[00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.032]  Boehner leads Republicans in the House.
[00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:07.134]  And PlayStation 3 mania.
[00:01:07.154 --> 00:01:11.878]  This is News Wrap USA's Week in Review edition for Friday, November 17th, 2006.
[00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.941]  Let's take a look at the top headlines.
[00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:23.949]  Four Americans and an Austrian working for a security contractor in Iraq have been kidnapped, but other hostages taken yesterday have been free, while another has reportedly been found dead.
[00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:31.051]  This comes as an American in civilian clothes has been killed by Iraqi police in what may have been a misunderstanding at the checkpoint.
[00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:39.573]  Speaking from Vietnam ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, President Bush today comparing the Iraq War to America's role in Vietnam.
[00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:49.795]  The President says his trip to the communist country nearly 30 years after a war that split America shows wounds caused by the current conflict in Iraq can be healed in time.
[00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:56.784]  The APEC Summit of 21 Nations will focus on trade and other global issues, including North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons.
[00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:02.831]  On Vietnam, President Bush is consulting with the leaders of four countries involved in the six-party talks with North Korea.
[00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:08.779]  He also appears to be prepared to bring up the Communist North's nuclear program in the general session that will wrap up on Sunday.
[00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.861]  As expected, House Republicans have selected Ohio's John Boehner to lead them in the new Congress.
[00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:15.621]  Boehner will become Minority Leader.
[00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:21.964]  Roy Blunt of Missouri will take on the title of Minority Whip when Democrats take over control of Congress in January.
[00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:30.267]  Residents of Elmora, North Carolina are cleaning up after Thursday's deadly tornado that killed at least 8 people and destroyed 40 homes.
[00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.148]  About 20,000 customers lost power in that salon.
[00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:38.609]  A high demand for that new PlayStation 3 has resulted in violence throughout the U.S.
[00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:44.091]  A 21-year-old man waiting in line to buy a game at a Connecticut Walmart was shot during a robbery attempt.
[00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.272]  A Wisconsin man trampled in a stampede of customers.
[00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:56.055]  eBay currently listing more than 10,000 units for sale, many of them from sellers who waited in long lines in hopes of making big bucks by reselling them.
[00:02:56.235 --> 00:03:00.237]  How have he started to reach their lowest level in more than six... That he used.
[00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:01.617]  They're shameful.
[00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:06.719]  I debated him, of course, Thursday on my weekday show, and I totally cleaned his clock.
[00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.161]  Every time he's faced with facts, he has to retreat.
[00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.963]  But that's the same thing that the rest of the people out there bashing 9-11 Truth do.
[00:03:15.303 --> 00:03:17.704]  And what's 9-11 Truth, for those that have been hiding under a rock?
[00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:23.346]  It's the people, the scientists, the former top CIA analysts, the members of Congress,
[00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:42.923]  who questioned the official story of 9-11 because the official story has been proven to be a huge giant lie from one side to the other from end to end so later we'll get into the amazing hit piece now this is a new pilot for a Saturday night special he's going to be doing
[00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:47.783]  I guess that's kind of a pun, because ManCow is a Saturday Night Special.
[00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:51.464]  Worthless and cheap and petty and nickel-plated.
[00:03:51.924 --> 00:03:52.824]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:57.225]  For those who don't know, Saturday Night Special is a name for a cheap firearm you use to kill somebody.
[00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:11.029]  But Planet ManCow is the program, heavily hyped all week, and they started the show by saying that we're liars who live in backwoods shacks and tell lies.
[00:04:12.216 --> 00:04:16.260]  And I couldn't make it a few weeks ago for the taping because of family commitments.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.421]  They had set me up for the show.
[00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.743]  I had forgotten a family commitment.
[00:04:19.823 --> 00:04:20.844]  I said, I'm canceling.
[00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:22.446]  They said, give us somebody else.
[00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:23.787]  And I said, okay, who am I going to be debating?
[00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:27.070]  And they said, a New York firefighter who thinks you're a liar.
[00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:31.848]  And I said, oh, you're trying to claim that we're against the firefighters, which isn't the case.
[00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.393]  The majority of firefighters agree with our view on 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:39.116]  At the bare minimum, the vast majority know there's a cover-up.
[00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:44.222]  And I've got footage in New York on two separate trips where they're all running up to us in their dress blues.
[00:04:44.622 --> 00:04:45.122]  We're good to go.
[00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:05.445]  And they were claiming he was going to come on and call us liars.
[00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:07.107]  He didn't, indeed, do that.
[00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:10.649]  And it looks like we may be turning him over from the dark side to the light side here.
[00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.452]  But Mankow tried to imply, basically, again, it's us against the firefighters.
[00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:23.379]  That's one of many things that he did, and we're going to be exposing what Fox News did a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:29.564]  But we ought to be happy that Fox News is attacking us, and even Rush Limbaugh is commenting on this show.
[00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:32.237]  That's good.
[00:05:32.357 --> 00:05:34.038]  It shows that we're having an effect.
[00:05:34.358 --> 00:05:39.903]  The real conservatives, and that's me folks, that's my listeners, we're actually for controlling the borders.
[00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.384]  We're actually for the Second Amendment.
[00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:44.166]  We're actually against debasing the value of the dollar.
[00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:47.189]  We're actually against bankrupting this country.
[00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.952]  George Bush and his followers are not conservatives.
[00:05:51.332 --> 00:05:55.556]  They're not anything near conservatives, and it's time that that be exposed.
[00:05:55.816 --> 00:06:00.440]  By the way, that leads me to our second big story that I'll be detailing first.
[00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:12.767]  Bush, of course, two days ago was, he's now in South Korea, he was in Vietnam, there in Southeast Asia, the site of that war that went on from 1960 to 1975.
[00:06:14.128 --> 00:06:28.332]  Didn't officially get announced, well it never got officially announced, the war never got declared, but they didn't officially kick it off and start calling it a war until the staged Gulf of Tonkin incident where our government staged an attack on their own ships, now declassified to kick off the war in 64.
[00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:34.584]  And the LBJ tapes, of course, have been released right here in Austin, Texas from the LBJ Museum and Library.
[00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:42.346]  So, basically, Bush is in Vietnam, and I have the quotes here.
[00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:44.847]  He says, well, I've learned a lesson from Vietnam.
[00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:46.448]  We shouldn't have quit.
[00:06:46.808 --> 00:06:51.429]  We should have kept fighting like the North Vietnamese, and that's what we need to do in Iraq.
[00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:59.072]  He actually said that the lesson of Vietnam is, we didn't stay there long enough.
[00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:06.150]  58,000 dead Americans, a million-plus dead in the South, untold millions in the North.
[00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:20.874]  So we're talking about millions of people here who are dead, including 58,000 Americans, over 200-plus thousand seriously injured, many of them double and triple and quad amputees.
[00:07:20.894 --> 00:07:23.135]  That's when both your arms and legs are blown off.
[00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:25.676]  Agent Orange, all of it.
[00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:28.618]  The answer, Bush says, is continuing the course.
[00:07:28.658 --> 00:07:38.503]  And so, he has his daddy and the Iraq Study Group, and I predicted last week, I said they're going to issue their report mid-week, and I said this is what it's going to say.
[00:07:38.963 --> 00:07:52.730]  It's going to say, stay the course, but with a new spin, oh, we need to build up the Iraqi military, the Iraqi National Guard, as it's called, we need to build it up to battalions, but to do that, we first need to put 20,000 more troops in.
[00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:56.312]  That's exactly what they called for.
[00:07:56.493 --> 00:07:59.493]  That's exactly what Bush for three and a half years has been saying.
[00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:03.494]  It is the exact same course, but they act like in the media that Bush Sr.
[00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:13.376]  and James Baker came and spanked him, and now he's been defeated, and now we can work together, and John McCain calls for putting 20,000 more troops in, and stabilizing, and then pulling out.
[00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.497]  They've been saying that for three and a half years!
[00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:21.458]  And they'll be saying it next year, and another year, and when Hillary Clinton's in office, it'll be, boost the troops.
[00:08:22.549 --> 00:08:25.232]  Now, Mertha and others in Congress are trying to stop this.
[00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:37.464]  They may be successful, more power to them, but the Democratic leadership run by that intellectual prostitute, Nancy Pelosi, who lied to her constituents, and then as soon as she got in, no investigations, no nothing.
[00:08:37.504 --> 00:08:39.146]  She said a year ago there would be an impeachment.
[00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:41.648]  Two weeks before the election, she said that's now off the table.
[00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:44.171]  She's reading the same talking points with President Bush.
[00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:51.876]  The same agenda whether, again, whether it was Kennedy, or whether it was LBJ, or whether it was Nixon, the war continued.
[00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:55.818]  It's going to be the same thing here when a Democrat's in office.
[00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:57.279]  Because it's about big business.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:05.625]  Over a hundred billion dollars a year is made by defense contractors in Iraq alone off this war.
[00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:07.486]  They just want to have a war!
[00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.768]  People say, oh, we can't cut and run.
[00:09:09.868 --> 00:09:11.469]  Oh, don't worry, there's no cut and running.
[00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:13.270]  And by the way, Iraq is not a disaster.
[00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:25.315]  The Pentagon plan from the 80s, another Pentagon plan from 2002, there's an Israeli plan from 1983, and my new film Terror Storm shows the plans, the documents, the admissions.
[00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:27.318]  That's just five minutes of a two hour film.
[00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:30.903]  It's an encyclopedia, an anthology.
[00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:40.051]  of government crime, they say we're going to go in, break it in three parts, have sectarian war, play them off against each other, de-industrialize the country, and build permanent bases in there to control the region.
[00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:42.073]  That's exactly what's happening.
[00:09:42.093 --> 00:09:43.034]  It's like the war on drugs.
[00:09:43.074 --> 00:09:43.775]  They say it's a failure.
[00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:44.736]  More drugs on the street?
[00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:45.597]  Uh-uh!
[00:09:45.637 --> 00:09:46.477]  More people in prison?
[00:09:46.497 --> 00:09:47.078]  More drugs?
[00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:48.119]  More corrupt cops?
[00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:49.260]  More paid-off politicians?
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.862]  That's the plan!
[00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:56.447]  Alright, we'll be right back to continue going over this and several other important, big, breaking stories.

[00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:59.294]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.121]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.061]  Today is November 17th, 2006.
[00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:05.983]  Gold opened at $614.40 an ounce and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $634.84 and $319.97 for half ounce coins.
[00:11:06.003 --> 00:11:06.283]  That's $634.84 and $319.97.
[00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:13.166]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interests.
[00:11:29.193 --> 00:11:32.434]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:11:32.534 --> 00:11:35.955]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:11:36.035 --> 00:11:39.016]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:11:39.296 --> 00:11:42.157]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:11:42.217 --> 00:11:42.517]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:44.518]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:44.698]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:57.506]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:57.586 --> 00:11:59.908]  It's here.
[00:12:04.371 --> 00:12:09.155]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:17.122]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:24.895]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:12:25.296 --> 00:12:36.719]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.941]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:42.921]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:12:43.242 --> 00:12:47.023]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.743]  It's not about right versus left.
[00:14:13.264 --> 00:14:15.386]  It's about right versus wrong.
[00:14:15.747 --> 00:14:17.690]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.172]  Call Alex now at 1-877-590-5525.
[00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.073]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:14:31.542 --> 00:14:34.443]  And tonight, the man known for his mouth getting a new forum.
[00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:40.505]  Eric Mancow Muller hosting his own primetime special right here on the Fox News Channel here now in New York.
[00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:43.806]  Mancow, you're actually going to have a guy who doesn't believe in the 9-11.
[00:14:44.147 --> 00:14:45.887]  He thinks it's a whole conspiracy.
[00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:47.848]  He's going to go up against a firefighter.
[00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:48.388]  This has got to be great.
[00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:53.190]  You know these woodsy people that hang out in sheds and type a bunch of lies and they piecemeal things.
[00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:59.474]  And, uh, you know, maybe I've been fooled by the Fox News network myself that, uh, it was a bunch of crazies that brought down planes.
[00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:04.117]  He believes it was robots and computers and, uh, George W. Bush was planting bombs.
[00:15:04.397 --> 00:15:13.143]  And I had him, a couple of miles from here, go face-to-face, one of these conspiracy nuts, face-to-face with a firefighter who was there pulling his buddies out of the rubble at 9-11.
[00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:16.125]  It is the most, well, some of the most powerful TV you'll ever see in your life.
[00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:20.768]  If you speak, you can move mountains, and some big things are said one hour from now.
[00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.191]  Alright folks, welcome back.
[00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:32.154]  So, in the next segment after we take some calls, I'm going to play a few minutes of the real lies.
[00:15:32.234 --> 00:15:33.934]  Now, I've known Mankal for years.
[00:15:34.335 --> 00:15:47.360]  They know we're not backwoods living in shacks, but he thinks that his audience is stupid, and so we're these people living in shacks, putting lies on the internet, and then he does something that's really junior high.
[00:15:48.284 --> 00:15:51.106]  Oh, we're going to put them face-to-face with a firefighter.
[00:15:51.146 --> 00:15:55.709]  And then Mankow throughout the broadcast kept saying, well, you guys go ahead and fight with each other.
[00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:57.570]  So, you hate the firemen.
[00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.711]  You think they were part of it.
[00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:01.153]  We've never said the firemen were part of it.
[00:16:01.633 --> 00:16:05.476]  But the establishment continues to try this over and over again.
[00:16:06.511 --> 00:16:12.156]  But the incredible thing is the majority of the firefighters that we talked to, I'd have to say in New York it was 99%.
[00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:19.162]  One firefighter flipped us off and he was there at Ground Zero this year for the memorial on 9-11 from New Jersey.
[00:16:19.702 --> 00:16:26.508]  I mean I had police captains on video saying, thank you, keep it up, I'm out there bullhorning going, 9-11 is an inside job, what do you think police officers?
[00:16:26.728 --> 00:16:28.850]  They go, we know, we know, keep it up!
[00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.513]  I mean I'm making a film about it right now, literally!
[00:16:32.694 --> 00:16:33.054]  I've got
[00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:35.192]  Probably twenty police on tape.
[00:16:35.372 --> 00:16:36.212]  We weren't even looking for this.
[00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:37.232]  I should have been going after this.
[00:16:37.813 --> 00:16:38.873]  Twenty police on tape.
[00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:40.334]  Hundreds of firefighters on tape.
[00:16:40.574 --> 00:16:42.955]  Police captains in their full dress uniforms.
[00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:44.916]  When they're looking at me, I go, what do you think about this?
[00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:46.096]  Keep it up, Alex.
[00:16:46.136 --> 00:16:46.896]  We appreciate it.
[00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:48.497]  This is when I show up places.
[00:16:48.697 --> 00:16:49.537]  The cops know me.
[00:16:49.738 --> 00:16:50.858]  With thousands of protesters.
[00:16:50.898 --> 00:16:51.538]  Hi, Alex.
[00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:52.299]  Keep it up.
[00:16:52.319 --> 00:16:53.079]  Appreciate ya.
[00:16:54.798 --> 00:17:14.263]  I mean, so again, but Fox News tries to create the illusion that we're the minority and we're attacking the firefighters and we don't like them, and even the firefighter they had on the show refused to go along with that, but showing his ignorance, Kevin starts bringing up what's been all over national television, all over the major papers.
[00:17:14.403 --> 00:17:18.224]  It's now admitted that Christina Todd Whitman, the head of the EPA,
[00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:23.388]  Was ordered by the White House to lie and claim that the air was safe.
[00:17:23.428 --> 00:17:25.732]  That's now declassified public.
[00:17:25.772 --> 00:17:29.577]  They blocked the aid of the firemen, the policemen, the emergency workers.
[00:17:30.278 --> 00:17:31.520]  I've interviewed a lot of these people.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.486]  The firemen didn't even know that and was defending the EPA head!
[00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:39.879]  I mean, literally, folks, this shows the ignorance of the general public.
[00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:43.460]  And then after the show, Kevin, because again, I couldn't go up to Fox Studios.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.300]  They wanted me there.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.260]  I couldn't go.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.841]  I had a family arrangement.
[00:17:47.081 --> 00:17:51.462]  So I sent my radio producer, Hey, Trey, someday you can end up getting dispatched.
[00:17:52.522 --> 00:17:54.182]  I'll start sending you off, too.
[00:17:54.542 --> 00:17:57.223]  No, I mean, Kevin's very articulate, as you're going to hear.
[00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.603]  And they kept trying to make him mad.
[00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:00.844]  Mancow got really, really mad.
[00:18:00.864 --> 00:18:05.645]  But the reason we're talking about this today is because it illustrates
[00:18:06.232 --> 00:18:16.536]  To everyone that they can't argue with us, and they can't face us on the facts, and they have to build straw men, fake arguments, and lie about us.
[00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:21.277]  Now, my screen was full of calls here, and I still see them on the board, but my screen got wiped out somehow.
[00:18:21.697 --> 00:18:31.581]  And I know some of these callers wanted to talk about the Fox News special last night attacking us, so perhaps you can get that back up there for me, and I'll go to some of those calls.
[00:18:32.677 --> 00:18:34.658]  I'm still a baby in the studio, folks.
[00:18:35.478 --> 00:18:39.239]  For years, I've been doing a radio show out of my own office, or out of my own house, like Art Bell does.
[00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:49.762]  It's really the only way to fly, but it's always great to be back in a real radio studio, and they're doing a wonderful job, but I'm kind of like an astronaut orbiting the planet.
[00:18:49.882 --> 00:18:58.185]  I am up to their discretion down at the Houston command base, or down at the Cape Canaveral base there in Florida.
[00:18:59.102 --> 00:18:59.562]  Basically.
[00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:09.327]  Later, I also want to get into the toll roads here in Central Texas and nationwide and the propaganda and the media spin trying to sell this to the American people.
[00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:13.768]  But it's going to take more than a spoonful of sugar to get this cyanide down our throats.
[00:19:14.089 --> 00:19:16.910]  I want to talk about this sickening, what looks to be a serial killer.
[00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:36.922]  Here in Austin, Texas as well, Michael Keith Moore, just because it gets into the mindset of the type of people that are into butchering and torturing women, the very same mindset that's in our global leaders, but just like the women that get in the cars with these killers, the general public gets on the bus with the New World Order, it's the same criminology.
[00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:37.622]  I want to go over it.
[00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:39.563]  And there is some good news!
[00:19:40.184 --> 00:19:43.966]  Some of the Democratic leadership, and some of them are powerful committee chairmen,
[00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.684]  are moving to overturn H.R.
[00:19:46.704 --> 00:19:55.270]  6166 that fully abolished the Bill of Rights, that allows a secret arrest, secret torture, secret execution of American citizens.
[00:19:55.651 --> 00:20:01.075]  They are moving to repeal those subsections and the American people have got to get behind it.
[00:20:02.216 --> 00:20:11.683]  And the two other points I want to make, just right now before I forget, when I left here, the KLBJ studios, where we syndicate this program from, last Sunday night,
[00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:16.422]  I was driving to meet my family at that interesting European-style circus, by the way.
[00:20:16.442 --> 00:20:17.022]  It was pretty weird.
[00:20:17.502 --> 00:20:19.102]  But to make a long story short, I digress.
[00:20:19.662 --> 00:20:32.325]  I'm driving over there, and I'm listening to Beyond the Beltway, which is a very highly respected, great syndicated program that has both sides, multiple sides, sometimes four or five sides on it.
[00:20:32.485 --> 00:20:35.526]  It's also a TV program, but they simulcast it.
[00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:38.686]  And I'm listening to the Democratic and Republican strategists.
[00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:42.787]  In fact, I forgot to tell you, Trey, to grab clips of that from last week if we had a chance if you recorded it.
[00:20:43.927 --> 00:20:49.141]  Because I wanted to be able to play that here.
[00:20:49.402 --> 00:20:51.789]  And the Democratic and Republican strategists
[00:20:52.463 --> 00:21:01.729]  Both of them on the show said, there's a new movement in America, and if the Democrats don't do what this new movement wants, they'll be thrown out two in two years.
[00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:03.150]  And who is that new movement?
[00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.713]  They're the anti-New World Order movement.
[00:21:07.113 --> 00:21:10.015]  They're the anti-globalization movement.
[00:21:10.295 --> 00:21:13.917]  And the Republican agreed with the Chief Democratic Strategist.
[00:21:15.589 --> 00:21:34.723]  I'm driving home from the circus at like 10 o'clock at night, listening to Matt Drudge, who's also on this station, and many of the stations that carry this program, and he's got Pat Buchanan on, who's known what's going on for a while, but it doesn't... The point is, he's saying the American people are anti-North American Union, they're anti-open border, they're anti-one world government,
[00:21:35.103 --> 00:21:44.388]  The globalists control both parties, and I'm telling you, and you're sort of using the same polls that I used, the one from a month ago, 84% don't like either party.
[00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:45.689]  That's never happened before.
[00:21:45.709 --> 00:21:46.509]  Do you understand, folks?
[00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.110]  The globalists have blown it!
[00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:49.791]  They've shown us who they are!
[00:21:50.011 --> 00:21:56.735]  So the statesmen can write articles today here in Austin, telling us we all love the toll roads, and it makes us all money, and it's good.
[00:21:56.935 --> 00:21:59.777]  Hey, I'm sorry, 97% in major polls are against it.
[00:22:00.117 --> 00:22:04.420]  And no amount of your propaganda, no amount of your spin, and no amount of your outright lies.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.101]  The Chronicle a few months ago said it's not Spanish-owned.
[00:22:07.482 --> 00:22:10.663]  I mean, everybody knows Cintra's Spanish-owned, you liar!
[00:22:10.904 --> 00:22:13.065]  Lewis Black, writing that editorial?
[00:22:13.225 --> 00:22:14.106]  You make me sick!
[00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:23.591]  I mean, how does Lewis Black think he gets away with writing his editorial comment in the front of the paper telling you that Cintra's not Spanish-owned?
[00:22:24.132 --> 00:22:27.894]  That is the equivalent of saying trees aren't green, water isn't blue,
[00:22:28.962 --> 00:22:32.003]  The sun isn't yellow, I mean... We gotcha!
[00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:32.683]  You understand?
[00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:33.904]  We gotcha!
[00:22:34.084 --> 00:22:40.266]  You told us to sit down, shut up, go along with your orders, don't get angry... No, we're gonna get angry!
[00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:41.447]  About things that matter!
[00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:43.688]  Not football, but the freedom in this country!
[00:22:43.888 --> 00:22:47.269]  We'll be right back, stay with us, your calls, tons of news, straight ahead!
[00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:08.751]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.792]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:12.133]  That's one in four adults.
[00:23:12.506 --> 00:23:18.610]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:24:59.952 --> 00:25:01.053]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:25:01.093 --> 00:25:01.933]  Today is November 17, 2006.
[00:25:02.013 --> 00:25:06.056]  Gold opened at $614.40 an ounce and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $634.84 and $319.97 for half ounce coins.
[00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:06.416]  That's $634.84 and $319.97.
[00:25:06.476 --> 00:25:10.279]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank
[00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:28.992]  ...of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:25:29.112 --> 00:25:32.374]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:35.877]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:25:35.957 --> 00:25:38.940]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.102]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:25:42.162 --> 00:25:42.603]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:25:42.683 --> 00:25:44.264]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.

[00:27:17.959 --> 00:27:19.520]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:29.716]  Welcome back.
[00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:31.978]  We're going to be taking your calls here in just a moment.
[00:27:31.998 --> 00:27:32.518]  877-590-5525.
[00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:39.382]  That's 877-590-5525 or locally here in Central Texas.
[00:27:39.963 --> 00:27:46.066]  If you're a KLBJ 590 listener, 836-0590 will get you up and on the air.
[00:27:46.427 --> 00:27:47.747]  Let's roll through some of your calls.
[00:27:47.787 --> 00:27:49.648]  They're coming in about the election a few weeks ago.
[00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:53.551]  They're coming in about Bush's comments about, you know, don't give up.
[00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:55.032]  That's the lesson of Vietnam.
[00:27:55.392 --> 00:27:57.053]  I guess you can interpret that however you like.
[00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:08.945]  You can comment on the Fox News special attacking my office last night with my radio producer who I dispatched to New York City to Fox News Center who, by the way, did a great job.
[00:28:10.586 --> 00:28:11.726]  You can talk about whatever you'd like.
[00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:17.769]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Mark in Chicago.
[00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:19.530]  Mark, thank you for holding.
[00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.910]  Welcome.
[00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:21.591]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:21.651 --> 00:28:22.471]  Always great to talk to you.
[00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:27.374]  I spoke with you before on your show and I just want to talk about Mankow here and Rush and Hannity and all these guys.
[00:28:28.129 --> 00:28:35.472]  I think that the paradigm that people don't understand is that a lot of these people are compromised, or they're paid a lot of money to have the opinions that they have.
[00:28:35.932 --> 00:28:47.356]  And I think when you watch them go off like, man, Kyle was a joke, we would really like to know here in Chicago why someone like he has to be so negative against you and not have any proof to back anything he says.
[00:28:47.857 --> 00:28:50.218]  Now, I run a website, 911essential.com.
[00:28:50.278 --> 00:28:51.878]  I've featured you since day one.
[00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:53.499]  I've got all your videos up there.
[00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:55.102]  I don't think so.
[00:29:20.037 --> 00:29:29.721]  And the reason they know is because when things change here, and it's going to change, they're going to find out what they're going to be looked at in a way maybe Goebbels was looked at, let's say.
[00:29:29.961 --> 00:29:32.302]  Did you see the Fox News piece last night?
[00:29:32.342 --> 00:29:35.343]  If you didn't, we have it posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:35.503 --> 00:29:36.624]  I don't own a TV, Alex.
[00:29:36.664 --> 00:29:37.104]  How's that?
[00:29:37.804 --> 00:29:40.205]  Hey, I don't blame you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.367]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Atlanta.
[00:29:43.447 --> 00:29:44.707]  Mark, welcome to the airwaves.
[00:29:45.968 --> 00:29:46.448]  Hello!
[00:29:46.728 --> 00:29:47.128]  Hello, sir.
[00:29:50.127 --> 00:30:14.245]  I'm following, I don't know if John Connor is his actual name given at birth or if it's his nom de guerre, but I checked out his thing about Georgia Guidestones, went out there, took pictures, emptied my bladder upon it, and I've been amazed at how these people in the Mini Truth Media cartel seem to have all taken, they all seem to have in common that they've all taken the blue pill.
[00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:17.089]  All right, let me just stop you for a moment.
[00:30:17.109 --> 00:30:19.752]  I love your call, but we're not having a private conversation.
[00:30:19.812 --> 00:30:25.338]  You have to remember, most people listening to you right now don't know I interviewed John Connor last week.
[00:30:25.358 --> 00:30:26.720]  Yes, it's a pen name.
[00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:35.772]  He goes into major universities, big events, and starts screaming 9-11 is an inside job very effectively.
[00:30:36.172 --> 00:30:43.559]  He goes into college libraries and does it, and hands out thousands of 9-11 DVDs like Loose Change and Terror Storm and others.
[00:30:43.939 --> 00:30:47.282]  He's a good friend of mine, and he's doing a wonderful job out on the West Coast.
[00:30:47.302 --> 00:30:52.587]  He also calls into all the big national shows and brings up Bohemian Grove, Skull & Bones,
[00:30:53.127 --> 00:30:54.809]  9-11, and we should all do that.
[00:30:54.869 --> 00:30:59.994]  Now, for those who don't know what the Georgia Guidestones are, a globalist organization put these up.
[00:31:00.454 --> 00:31:17.690]  I actually have to fly up there, and I was about to ask listeners to go shoot good video of the Georgia Guidestones for me, and I'd use it in a new film I'm making, or I may have to go to Georgia, and this is where they say they're going to kill 90 plus percent of us, one world government, this is their religious, I guess, totem,
[00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:22.761]  Well, regarding the Guidestones, I'll be happy to email you or send you a CD of the pictures I took.
[00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:25.622]  If you want me to go borrow a camcorder, that's fine too.
[00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:52.806]  Well, I mean, that would be wonderful, but whoever does it, if the video isn't... I mean, I need like a wide shot with the Georgia Guidestones and the clouds rolling by.
[00:31:53.027 --> 00:31:57.547]  I mean, if I went there, I'd probably shoot like a... Oh, what's it called?
[00:31:58.148 --> 00:32:00.448]  I make these films and I forget what the term is.
[00:32:00.668 --> 00:32:01.348]  Documentary.
[00:32:01.828 --> 00:32:03.449]  No, I'm not talking about a documentary.
[00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:05.289]  I'm talking about a time-lapse.
[00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:06.629]  I would probably do a time-lapse of it.
[00:32:06.929 --> 00:32:09.410]  I would show all the close-ups of the ten planks of it.
[00:32:10.273 --> 00:32:10.513]  Right.
[00:32:11.014 --> 00:32:26.245]  Well, the point is that one of the things I want to call into these various people, and one of the major points I want to get across to these people, is that I went to a cult awareness conference some years ago, and they explained a tactic that cults use.
[00:32:26.545 --> 00:32:29.748]  And I don't think they're consciously aware of the tactic.
[00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:33.130]  They just do it, and it works for them, and that reinforces it.
[00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.311]  It's called loaded language.
[00:32:34.907 --> 00:32:41.974]  And basically, it is a tongue that has a subconscious charge to stop people from thinking in a logical direction.
[00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:54.746]  In debate it's called an ad hominem attack, or it's calling us a conspiracy theorist makes us subhuman, or calling us liars with no proof, and then never actually responding with a real intellectual argument.
[00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:58.250]  Well, the point I would get at is that basically,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.142]  I wasn't thinking of it so much in those directions.
[00:33:01.202 --> 00:33:05.644]  I agree with your... that's the other point that I'd get across to these people like Neil Bortz.
[00:33:06.025 --> 00:33:11.088]  Hannity, I respected until I found out that he'd been invited to the Bohemian Grove, and I'm, whoa!
[00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:14.170]  You know, it's like, if they trust you, it means we can't.
[00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.091]  You know?
[00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:28.159]  But the thing is, basically, what people... the subconscious charge that people have with the term conspiracy theorist is to... that if they bother to examine the evidence at all,
[00:33:28.857 --> 00:33:29.878]  Then usually they don't.
[00:33:30.098 --> 00:33:39.744]  They will do so with a presupposition that it is all just a theory rather than the fact that a theory is defined as an explanation for a set of observed facts.
[00:33:39.764 --> 00:33:41.845]  Yes, they look at it with a jaundiced eye.
[00:33:41.945 --> 00:33:42.686]  Great call.
[00:33:42.786 --> 00:33:44.627]  I really appreciate your comments.
[00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:46.028]  And yeah, send us some photos of those.
[00:33:46.068 --> 00:33:50.311]  At the bare minimum, we'll put them up on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:33:53.058 --> 00:34:04.665]  Later, in the hour and in the next hour, I'm going to play segments of the 10 minutes that Kevin Smith was on the show, and I'm also going to play a clip of Shatner, just because I like Shatner, for no reason at all.
[00:34:04.845 --> 00:34:05.626]  Friends with Mancow.
[00:34:06.706 --> 00:34:09.208]  But you'll notice, he claims we're just trying to make money.
[00:34:09.428 --> 00:34:11.809]  A. Then he says we're liars.
[00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.211]  Then he says we're against the firefighters.
[00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:18.991]  What does the government being involved in 9-11 have to do with the firefighters?
[00:34:19.031 --> 00:34:21.792]  He tries to imply we're against the firefighters.
[00:34:21.892 --> 00:34:30.754]  In fact, I've been on talk shows where these guys, and it's always the big national ones who are slick, good liars, or know psychology, they go, why do you think the firefighters carried it out?
[00:34:31.455 --> 00:34:32.855]  And I go, I've never said that.
[00:34:33.755 --> 00:34:34.996]  Oh yeah, you think the government did?
[00:34:35.036 --> 00:34:35.756]  They're the government.
[00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:36.636]  No, no, no, no.
[00:34:36.716 --> 00:34:38.317]  It's criminal elements.
[00:34:38.637 --> 00:34:41.717]  It's because of the firefighters we know about the bombs.
[00:34:41.938 --> 00:34:43.318]  They're our biggest witnesses!
[00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:47.032]  Again, we cannot fight them off of us in New York!
[00:34:47.072 --> 00:34:51.613]  I can be in a restaurant, a bar, on the street, at Ground Zero, and the firefighters come over.
[00:34:52.294 --> 00:34:59.716]  Firefighter Engineering, the biggest and oldest firefighting publication in the country, said clearly that fire didn't bring down either of those three buildings.
[00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:00.756]  Okay?
[00:35:00.976 --> 00:35:04.257]  And clearly there's been a, quote, criminal cover-up of what happened.
[00:35:04.457 --> 00:35:05.838]  The firefighters are for us.
[00:35:05.858 --> 00:35:10.999]  And by the way, when I refused to go on Fox, because, again, I'm going anywhere, anytime, if it's live.
[00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:12.900]  I had a family engagement coming up.
[00:35:14.068 --> 00:35:15.251]  So I said, you know what, I'm not going.
[00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:16.233]  They said, well give it to somebody else.
[00:35:16.553 --> 00:35:17.515]  I gave them firefighters.
[00:35:17.555 --> 00:35:18.578]  I gave them emergency workers.
[00:35:18.838 --> 00:35:20.301]  I gave them National Guard that was there.
[00:35:20.321 --> 00:35:21.824]  I gave them a member of Homeland Security.
[00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:24.911]  That's right, they had Homeland Security before 9-11, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.991]  In the Hazardous Materials Disposal, Mike McCormick.
[00:35:28.552 --> 00:35:31.053]  I gave them all these people and they didn't want them.
[00:35:31.513 --> 00:35:33.855]  They wanted one of our people to attack me.
[00:35:34.075 --> 00:35:35.716]  So I said, fine, Kevin Smith will go.
[00:35:35.796 --> 00:35:36.316]  Kevin went.
[00:35:36.516 --> 00:35:39.818]  He did as good a job as I did, as I would have done.
[00:35:39.878 --> 00:35:41.119]  He did it maybe even better.
[00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:43.900]  He did a wonderful job and you're going to hear that.
[00:35:44.781 --> 00:35:51.544]  But they wanted to have us versus the firefighter and they fell flat on their faces in a pathetic fashion.
[00:35:51.564 --> 00:35:52.625]  Do I have time to go to a call here?
[00:35:54.033 --> 00:35:54.333]  I don't.
[00:35:54.353 --> 00:35:55.374]  Yeah, we've got about a minute and a half.
[00:35:55.394 --> 00:35:56.214]  We'll go to Megan.
[00:35:56.555 --> 00:35:57.635]  We'll go to Joanne.
[00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.516]  Ladies, stay there.
[00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:00.397]  We will get to you.
[00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:02.258]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:36:02.278 --> 00:36:02.638]  877-590-5525.
[00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:14.526]  By the way, every broadcast here on air, I challenge you, if you disagree with me, call into the show and tell me why you disagree.
[00:36:14.586 --> 00:36:15.406]  Tell me why I'm wrong.
[00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:16.547]  And we have a rule here.
[00:36:17.387 --> 00:36:18.828]  We don't just screen your calls.
[00:36:19.168 --> 00:36:20.369]  There's no screening going on.
[00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:21.570]  We don't stop there, though.
[00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:29.682]  If you volunteer that you disagree with us, you go to the head of the line.
[00:36:30.682 --> 00:36:31.082]  Okay?
[00:36:31.682 --> 00:36:32.283]  Here's the number.
[00:36:32.303 --> 00:36:33.123]  877-590-5525.
[00:36:33.343 --> 00:36:41.366]  Maybe you're a neocon, a person who thinks gun control is conservative, who's listening out there, or thinks open borders is conservative.
[00:36:42.006 --> 00:36:45.327]  You're a George Bush jock snipper, basically.
[00:36:45.367 --> 00:36:46.288]  I'm sorry to have to say that.
[00:36:47.188 --> 00:36:48.989]  If you want to call in, 877-590-5525, we'll be right back.
[00:36:49.009 --> 00:36:49.369]  Stay with us.

[00:39:02.823 --> 00:39:08.145]  To the banks, the credit card companies, the lenders and financial institutions, you are just a number.
[00:39:08.426 --> 00:39:09.506]  Your credit score.
[00:39:09.786 --> 00:39:14.428]  And unless that number is above their standards, you get stuck paying more for everything.

[00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.711]  Thank you again for joining us on this Sunday.
[00:41:39.986 --> 00:41:45.447]  I'm going to go back to your calls, and then before we end this hour, I'm going to play a little bit of the Fox News attack piece last night.
[00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:49.848]  Starting the next hour, I'll play the rest of it, and we'll take your calls on this issue and others.
[00:41:50.468 --> 00:42:02.351]  But later in the next hour, you'll definitely want to stay tuned, because I'm going to break down the five different options that the Pentagon Study Group, run by James Baker, George Bush Sr.'
[00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:09.152]  's cover-up or cleaner, a Pentagon cleaner back from the Iran-Contra days, the former Secretary of State,
[00:42:11.293 --> 00:42:16.876]  What is the Pentagon Study Group really calling for?
[00:42:17.157 --> 00:42:22.160]  Well, they've now made the recommendation and we'll break down exactly what that means.
[00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:25.863]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:42:25.883 --> 00:42:27.544]  Let's talk to Megan in Canada.
[00:42:27.784 --> 00:42:29.285]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Megan.
[00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:31.867]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:32.087 --> 00:42:35.029]  I just want to say thank you very much for all the work that you're doing.
[00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:54.208]  For years after September 11th, I thought that all the Constitutionalists had disappeared, and I found you a few months ago, and I'm just relieved that there are people like you out there doing what you're doing.
[00:42:58.294 --> 00:42:59.075]  Well, that's exciting.
[00:42:59.095 --> 00:43:01.096]  I mean, it's always good to know there are like-minded people.
[00:43:01.136 --> 00:43:02.937]  But really, we are the majority.
[00:43:03.297 --> 00:43:07.960]  People all over the country are saying that the issue is globalism.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.541]  The issue is the loss of freedom.
[00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:13.403]  The issue are these transnational banks taking over our society.
[00:43:13.443 --> 00:43:14.384]  What's on your mind, Megan?
[00:43:15.044 --> 00:43:24.450]  Well, there's an interesting quote that was made on the Chris Matthews Show on October 26th that I thought you might be interested in.
[00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:35.147]  Tony Snow was on, and he said that basically, to quote him, General George Casey, today in briefing the press, made a very important point.
[00:43:35.227 --> 00:43:38.247]  He said, you know, in three years we haven't lost a single engagement.
[00:43:39.248 --> 00:43:49.509]  Now, look, I notice that you're very big on history, and I've watched a lot of your films where you're teaching people history, which is so very important, because history is a study of consequences.
[00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.530]  They never lost engagements in Vietnam.
[00:43:53.828 --> 00:43:55.670]  That's absolutely right.
[00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:10.481]  In the mid-70s, one Colonel Harry G. Summers had occasion to speak with Vietnam War Colonel II of the North Vietnamese Army, and Summers said to him, you know, you never defeated us on the battlefield, and he replied, that's true, but it's also irrelevant.
[00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:16.305]  Well, I mean, everything about asymmetrical guerrilla warfare is that it's a war of attrition.
[00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:22.623]  You're simply trying to wear out the enemy and wear out their resolve.
[00:44:22.843 --> 00:44:31.231]  And bottom line, if you take the aims of this government at face value, we're losing the war.
[00:44:32.424 --> 00:44:35.066]  But in reality, we're really, quote, winning it.
[00:44:35.526 --> 00:44:39.769]  And by we, we're not really part of this system, but we always think of ourselves psychologically.
[00:44:40.029 --> 00:44:49.595]  The big private banks that own and run this country as their private, you know, ball-headed stepchild, they basically are winning because they're going to be there for decades.
[00:44:49.775 --> 00:44:51.276]  They're going to make hundreds of billions a year.
[00:44:51.936 --> 00:45:04.560]  And they'll just keep double-teaming us with good cop, bad cop, like WWF Wrestling, putting Democrats, Republicans, Democrats, Republicans in, and they'll just keep rolling on for 15 years, 20 years, like Vietnam.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:11.582]  What do you think of Bush's comment about, we need to take a lesson from the Vietnamese and not give up?
[00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:16.784]  That's what I take from a Vietnam with the Iraq situation.
[00:45:16.804 --> 00:45:17.824]  I mean, that's incredible.
[00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:19.440]  Well, it's stupid.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.982]  I mean, this whole, this whole, uh, quote, cut and run.
[00:45:22.403 --> 00:45:28.528]  You know, at a certain point, you know, you cut your losses and get out if you're losing.
[00:45:28.768 --> 00:45:31.811]  If you're, if you're, if you're... But again, they're not losing.
[00:45:31.911 --> 00:45:34.993]  The defense contractors don't care how many our boys and girls die.
[00:45:35.294 --> 00:45:36.975]  They don't care how many legs get blown off.
[00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:42.340]  They don't care how many of the troops have to pay for their flight home, as they do, or four dollars a day for their meals in the hospitals.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:42.920]  That's right.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.121]  They rape the troops.
[00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:45.522]  And I appreciate your call.
[00:45:45.582 --> 00:45:47.944]  It's really great to hear from you, Joanne.
[00:45:47.964 --> 00:45:48.284]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:48.584 --> 00:46:01.373]  Sticking an I Support the Troops sticker on your car, for many, means you actually forget about them, you don't care about them, you just feel good and associate your personal power with cluster bombs dropping on women and children.
[00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:05.055]  Okay, most people who are for this war don't know where Iraq is.
[00:46:05.115 --> 00:46:07.698]  They don't know any of the geopolitical histories of it.
[00:46:07.938 --> 00:46:15.486]  They don't know that the Pentagon wants urban warfare, wants strife, wants to kill as many Iraqis as possible.
[00:46:15.566 --> 00:46:19.350]  By the way, two plus million Iraqis are gone.
[00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.893]  Guess how many our own government admits?
[00:46:22.353 --> 00:46:23.935]  Guess how many Iraqis are dead?
[00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:36.473]  Since late 1990, through the Gulf War I, through the invasion in March 23rd of 2003, through till November of this month, November 19th today.
[00:46:37.113 --> 00:46:38.834]  And this number is about a month old.
[00:46:39.275 --> 00:46:40.476]  So it's far worse.
[00:46:40.516 --> 00:46:41.957]  Now, guess how many are dead?
[00:46:42.637 --> 00:46:45.919]  One point... Now, this is key.
[00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:50.182]  Well, let me just give you the numbers broken down before I put them into the big number.
[00:46:50.757 --> 00:46:53.922]  I'm sure you heard the British Medical Journal who had people there covering it.
[00:46:53.982 --> 00:46:55.104]  Very highly respected.
[00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:56.566]  Non-political.
[00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:59.190]  They said that 654,000 Iraqis are dead.
[00:47:03.872 --> 00:47:06.033]  Six-tenths plus of a million, okay?
[00:47:06.413 --> 00:47:08.173]  That's more than half a million dead.
[00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:14.575]  Six hundred and fifty four thousand, two hundred and something, I forget the exact number, are dead in the last three and a half years.
[00:47:14.635 --> 00:47:16.856]  That is a conservative estimate, they said.
[00:47:17.196 --> 00:47:19.456]  They said it could be as high as nine hundred plus thousand.
[00:47:19.697 --> 00:47:24.698]  But conservative, what they know have died six hundred plus thousand, okay?
[00:47:25.938 --> 00:47:29.819]  Now, before that, it's over a million and a half Iraqis.
[00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:31.500]  So, conservatively, two
[00:47:34.759 --> 00:47:35.620]  .15 million.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.962]  We know their population was 25 million in 1990.
[00:47:39.443 --> 00:47:43.245]  And it is now, my friends, 22 and some change.
[00:47:43.626 --> 00:47:46.147]  So, I guess, I mean, it'll be 6 million, 10 million.
[00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:47.248]  I mean, this will go on forever.
[00:47:47.408 --> 00:47:49.490]  Pretty soon, the last Iraqi will be gunned down.
[00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:50.931]  And that'll make a lot of you happy.
[00:47:50.971 --> 00:47:53.833]  I've heard you callin' the shows, Blast Parking Lot!
[00:47:54.473 --> 00:47:55.454]  Parking Lot'em!
[00:47:56.866 --> 00:48:17.551]  You don't want to know, it's admitted mainstream history that our government took Saddam at the age of 18 and 54, trained him as a CIA assassin, had him commit assassinations, then they finally got him in as the head of Baathist security in 69, helped stage a coup in 79 to put him in, told him to attack Iran, gave him $34 billion to do it, told him to go ahead and attack Kuwait, set him up, folks, a U.S.
[00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:18.332]  government agent.
[00:48:19.552 --> 00:48:20.932]  It's the same M.O.
[00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:23.953]  over and over and over and over and over.
[00:48:24.794 --> 00:48:26.856]  By the way, did you know Ho Chi Minh was a government agent?
[00:48:27.176 --> 00:48:37.122]  Ho Chi Minh was employed and given 900 plus million up until 1960 by our government to help us fight the Japanese, and then they tried to kill him, so he turned against us.
[00:48:37.402 --> 00:48:40.424]  Because the big banker boys of the oil companies, they want wars!
[00:48:40.444 --> 00:48:41.705]  You understand that's what they do?
[00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:47.309]  They write policy reports, Rand Corporation writes it, and says it, the Carnegie Foundation, public, go read it!
[00:48:48.211 --> 00:48:53.174]  Just like Carnegie Foundation pro-war documents, and you'll go read it from the thirties.
[00:48:53.214 --> 00:48:54.314]  We've got to always have wars.
[00:48:54.534 --> 00:48:55.375]  Let's fund Hitler.
[00:48:56.896 --> 00:48:57.776]  It's the same.
[00:48:57.996 --> 00:49:01.958]  Let's fund the radical Reconquistas that say the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:07.101]  Let's fund the radical Muslim groups, because you've got to have a business.
[00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:10.322]  Killing is the business, and business is good.
[00:49:10.603 --> 00:49:12.484]  Let's talk to Joanne in Victoria, Texas.
[00:49:12.524 --> 00:49:13.924]  Joanne, good to hear from you.
[00:49:14.305 --> 00:49:15.125]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:22.045]  I was just wanting to say, because you're having such a growing audience, that now you're becoming more of a threat to them.
[00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:29.832]  I just wanted you to say that I've been looking all over for you for about a couple of months now, and I finally found you on Sunday.
[00:49:29.852 --> 00:49:40.281]  I heard you first on the George Norris Show, and when I heard you I thought, well, you're the one that seems to have the whole picture almost together over anybody else.
[00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:53.677]  I've been doing this for about ten years, but before Clinton was elected the first time, I read two articles in Reader's Digest that exposed the Council on Foreign Relations and how they were putting into power all over the world.
[00:49:53.737 --> 00:50:09.307]  Ronald Reagan gave speeches against them all over the country and hated George Bush Senior, and then I talked to the Republicans that were at the RNC convention when they told him, look, you're not going to get the nomination even if the people want you unless you sign him on to basically run things.
[00:50:09.327 --> 00:50:10.187]  Right, right.
[00:50:11.864 --> 00:50:12.265]  You're right.
[00:50:12.285 --> 00:50:15.388]  The news media does not want us to know the truth.
[00:50:15.548 --> 00:50:18.111]  Most people in my family think I belong to a cult.
[00:50:18.852 --> 00:50:20.153]  Well, that's how they operate.
[00:50:20.213 --> 00:50:21.855]  And ma'am, it's good to have you on board with us.
[00:50:21.875 --> 00:50:23.157]  Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:50:23.577 --> 00:50:24.638]  out of the studios in Israelia.
[00:50:24.658 --> 00:50:24.778]  590-KLBJ.
[00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:29.185]  And you can tune in.
[00:50:29.285 --> 00:50:30.586]  It's being syndicated all over the country.
[00:50:30.606 --> 00:50:31.807]  A lot of stations have turned it on.
[00:50:32.128 --> 00:50:35.250]  A bunch of stations came in this week that are in the process.
[00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.092]  They've got to move shows, give them a month.
[00:50:37.432 --> 00:50:40.755]  That's why it's taking time, but they're really starting to sign on now.
[00:50:41.336 --> 00:50:44.058]  And it is just super, super, duper exciting.
[00:50:45.019 --> 00:50:48.602]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Alabama.
[00:50:49.042 --> 00:50:50.023]  Dan, welcome, sir.
[00:50:50.063 --> 00:50:51.505]  Yeah, there's one thing.
[00:50:52.065 --> 00:50:52.525]  Are you there?
[00:50:52.746 --> 00:50:53.026]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:53.576 --> 00:50:59.162]  Oh, that nobody's mentioning yet about them illegal getting rid of the Constitution?
[00:51:00.403 --> 00:51:00.744]  Yes.
[00:51:01.144 --> 00:51:13.377]  Article 5 of the Constitution says that the Senate and the House passes if they want to change the Constitution, and then it's got to go to the states where 38 states have got to approve it.
[00:51:15.427 --> 00:51:15.847]  That's right.
[00:51:15.887 --> 00:51:17.728]  Two-thirds ratification.
[00:51:18.769 --> 00:51:20.430]  Have we been talking about amendments today?
[00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.510]  No, I know.
[00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:25.433]  I've been trying for quite a while to get on with it.
[00:51:25.513 --> 00:51:29.835]  I've never heard nobody talk about it, but all them things are just worth the newspaper.
[00:51:29.915 --> 00:51:30.456]  No, no, no, man.
[00:51:30.476 --> 00:51:31.156]  I'm glad you called in.
[00:51:31.176 --> 00:51:32.917]  I was just trying to understand why you were bringing it up.
[00:51:33.577 --> 00:51:34.598]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:51:35.196 --> 00:51:37.359]  Well that's the most thing, that's the one thing we got there.
[00:51:37.379 --> 00:51:39.503]  All them bills they passed were unconstitutional.
[00:51:40.104 --> 00:51:41.666]  Alright sir, good to hear from you.
[00:51:41.686 --> 00:51:48.176]  Alright, we'll cover the whole man-cow, Fox News attacking us, we'll break it down, analyze it in the next hour, get into the war, the economy, a lot more.
[00:51:48.296 --> 00:51:49.138]  Your call, stay with us.
[00:51:50.263 --> 00:51:51.183]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:51:51.203 --> 00:51:58.346]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:58.606 --> 00:52:01.507]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:52:01.707 --> 00:52:07.349]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:11.950]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:16.492]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:52:21.434 --> 00:52:23.934]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.395 --> 00:52:26.295]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.015 --> 00:52:30.176]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:30.836 --> 00:52:37.317]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:52:38.077 --> 00:52:40.277]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.

[00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.578]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:50.326 --> 00:52:50.646]  Did you?
[00:52:51.347 --> 00:52:51.767]  We're done.
[00:52:52.747 --> 00:52:59.031]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview like no other.
[00:53:00.011 --> 00:53:01.812]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:53:02.813 --> 00:53:04.594]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.634 --> 00:53:05.394]  Defending our borders.
[00:53:05.894 --> 00:53:07.855]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:07.895 --> 00:53:09.376]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:53:09.536 --> 00:53:11.217]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.257 --> 00:53:13.718]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:53:14.299 --> 00:53:16.500]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:17.409 --> 00:53:19.192]  Call Alex now toll free 877-590-5525.
[00:53:19.673 --> 00:53:21.496]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[00:53:21.576 --> 00:53:23.058]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:38.369]  Welcome to our number two of the little Sunday broadcast we do here from the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ.
[00:53:38.769 --> 00:53:40.931]  Blasting out across the country, now syndicated.
[00:53:40.991 --> 00:53:42.493]  A lot of stations turning the show on.
[00:53:42.513 --> 00:53:44.856]  A lot of other stations saying they're going to be turning it on.
[00:53:45.636 --> 00:53:48.619]  It's really going well and I'm blessed and thankful to be here.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.662]  Thankful to MS Communications.
[00:53:51.162 --> 00:53:52.764]  Thankful to Genesis Communications.
[00:53:53.545 --> 00:54:01.953]  For teaming up and making this possible, and of course to the good Lord above, to my family, to Trey in there running the broadcast, to you the callers, the sponsors, everybody!
[00:54:02.894 --> 00:54:11.842]  It's good to be able to stand here with you and fight against globalization, fight against the New World Order, fight against the destruction of our Constitutional Republic.
[00:54:11.882 --> 00:54:14.245]  Okay, I want to go through the Pentagon Working Group.
[00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.463]  And their quote, new plan.
[00:54:16.923 --> 00:54:19.646]  It's not new, but I want to break that down.
[00:54:19.706 --> 00:54:20.787]  Also, some good news.
[00:54:21.267 --> 00:54:27.594]  Senator Dodd is saying he's going to try to repeal the Military Commissions Act that overturns the entire Bill of Rights.
[00:54:27.634 --> 00:54:30.577]  I mean, that literally killed the Bill of Rights.
[00:54:30.617 --> 00:54:32.539]  And if you kill the Bill of Rights, you kill America.
[00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:38.885]  Now, I've been saying for months since they passed this, back in October, since last month, I've been saying we can resuscitate the Republic.
[00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:43.302]  It's one thing to pass this stuff, it's another thing to implement it.
[00:54:43.382 --> 00:54:45.484]  So, it's the beginning of the death of the country.
[00:54:45.845 --> 00:54:50.750]  If they were ever able to implement it, wide scale, get away with it, the country would be dead.
[00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:56.195]  The country is not dead, at least in our hearts and minds, and in our common practices.
[00:54:56.515 --> 00:54:59.979]  They have not destroyed common law, the Magna Carta, Bill of Rights.
[00:55:00.419 --> 00:55:01.860]  And so we'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:55:02.181 --> 00:55:06.064]  I know we have a lot of phone calls, John, Dan, Garrett, and many others.
[00:55:06.104 --> 00:55:15.852]  The toll free number to join us in this hour, whether you're listening in Tennessee, Ohio, right here in Texas, or upstate New York, the toll free number to join us is 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525.
[00:55:24.201 --> 00:55:27.723]  But I first want to get into Mankal Muller and Fox News.
[00:55:27.763 --> 00:55:31.965]  And again, every week we're on TV or on the radio or in a newspaper.
[00:55:32.005 --> 00:55:33.086]  We don't normally cover it.
[00:55:33.786 --> 00:55:44.612]  But when the biggest cable news station in the country has an hour-long special and fully 16 minutes of it is about you.
[00:55:44.632 --> 00:55:47.193]  We're only going to play about 8 minutes of it here today.
[00:55:48.033 --> 00:55:48.674]  It's serious.
[00:55:48.914 --> 00:55:50.835]  And I just want to point out, out of the gates,
[00:55:52.444 --> 00:55:58.369]  That every interview I do, when it's a hit piece, it's always the same tired, tried out things.
[00:55:58.409 --> 00:55:59.370]  Well, I wasn't there.
[00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:01.831]  I couldn't go because of a family commitment.
[00:56:01.851 --> 00:56:02.572]  They wanted me to go.
[00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:05.975]  So I had Kevin Smith, my radio producer for my weekday show.
[00:56:06.355 --> 00:56:06.855]  I sent him.
[00:56:06.895 --> 00:56:13.961]  He's very articulate, very intelligent, and he's also hard to rattle when somebody's yelling at him or calling him names.
[00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:15.662]  Whereas I'm the opposite.
[00:56:16.604 --> 00:56:18.526]  No, actually, I can control myself if I want to.
[00:56:18.987 --> 00:56:21.531]  And so we sent Kevin up there, and I appreciate him going.
[00:56:22.152 --> 00:56:23.073]  He's a pilot, by the way.
[00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:24.275]  His brother's a commercial pilot.
[00:56:24.735 --> 00:56:31.265]  Kevin said that it was the roughest plane flight period, and he flies Pipers, that he's ever been in.
[00:56:32.374 --> 00:56:35.156]  The plane was dropping like a thousand feet and going back up.
[00:56:35.236 --> 00:56:36.517]  Everybody was vomiting on board.
[00:56:36.757 --> 00:56:37.577]  So I'm glad I didn't go.
[00:56:37.617 --> 00:56:38.398]  I'm glad Kevin went.
[00:56:38.778 --> 00:56:39.558]  That was the flight back.
[00:56:39.578 --> 00:56:43.160]  I remember like two weeks ago when they taped it, they had those horrible storms on the East Coast.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.481]  But I'm digressing.
[00:56:44.541 --> 00:56:46.422]  It must not be bad to talk radio, though, because you're tuned in.
[00:56:46.442 --> 00:56:47.663]  But that's how my brain works.
[00:56:47.683 --> 00:56:50.525]  I start telling the story and I go down every rabbit trail that's available.
[00:56:50.545 --> 00:56:56.148]  But in the interest of time, so Kevin goes up there and they swear, oh, it's not a hit piece.
[00:56:56.188 --> 00:56:56.788]  Oh, it's friendly.
[00:56:56.828 --> 00:56:57.669]  We want to ask you questions.
[00:56:57.689 --> 00:56:59.610]  We're like, sure it is Fox News.
[00:57:00.449 --> 00:57:03.213]  This isn't my first rodeo on national television.
[00:57:03.594 --> 00:57:05.617]  This isn't our first operation here.
[00:57:06.138 --> 00:57:08.802]  And so the first thing out of the gate says, you're doing this to make money!
[00:57:11.125 --> 00:57:13.748]  And that is a very serious charge.
[00:57:14.108 --> 00:57:16.891]  Now, obviously, I've got to make money to have ten employees.
[00:57:17.372 --> 00:57:22.737]  Obviously, I've got to make money to be able to make more films and buy the high-definition cameras and do what I do.
[00:57:22.978 --> 00:57:23.878]  And I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:28.023]  I like living in a decent house and driving a decent car and, you know, wearing decent shoes and clothes.
[00:57:28.383 --> 00:57:29.805]  But that's not what my life's about.
[00:57:29.865 --> 00:57:32.968]  Anybody who knows me, I'm not wearing Rolexes and rings and
[00:57:33.228 --> 00:57:34.388]  You know, I'm not into bling.
[00:57:34.468 --> 00:57:36.129]  I'm not into that.
[00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:43.390]  I'm into oak trees, and blue skies, and water skiing, and the beauty in the world.
[00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.951]  I do what I do from a place of passion.
[00:57:46.431 --> 00:57:49.311]  It's why I've done a free access TV show for 12 years.
[00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:55.073]  It's why I've been doing talk radio for 12 years, and I have to say, the first five or six, basically being paid nothing.
[00:57:55.613 --> 00:57:56.013]  Okay, folks.
[00:57:56.033 --> 00:57:59.734]  I mean, I'd have a couple other jobs than go in and do a weekday show here on another station.
[00:58:00.214 --> 00:58:01.034]  I mean, I got paid, I think, $200 a week.
[00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:03.802]  This is not about money.
[00:58:03.902 --> 00:58:07.064]  That's why I have a national distributor for TerrorStorm.
[00:58:08.085 --> 00:58:08.465]  Okay?
[00:58:09.326 --> 00:58:12.368]  And frankly, if I just sold it myself, I'd make more money.
[00:58:12.628 --> 00:58:15.730]  By having a distributor, they sell it to stores for 50-60% off.
[00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.151]  Then I get 20% of that.
[00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:20.373]  I get like 50 cents a dollar, depending on every DVD that's sold.
[00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:26.358]  But I still go with the distributor, and frankly, I've ended up not making as much money on TerrorStorm, but I've reached more people.
[00:58:26.718 --> 00:58:27.238]  I don't care.
[00:58:27.698 --> 00:58:28.239]  By the way,
[00:58:29.884 --> 00:58:30.664]  Take Terror Storm.
[00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:32.865]  It cost me $100,000 to make.
[00:58:32.885 --> 00:58:35.547]  You see, I have to have money to make that film.
[00:58:35.567 --> 00:58:37.347]  It cost me $100,000 to make.
[00:58:37.788 --> 00:58:40.269]  And I try to pay my employees decently.
[00:58:41.149 --> 00:58:42.750]  Most media pays their employees.
[00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:44.551]  That is at least small-time media.
[00:58:45.352 --> 00:58:50.234]  And I put it out for free, day one on Google Video, so millions could watch it.
[00:58:50.674 --> 00:58:53.996]  Okay, conversely, Fox News has published.
[00:58:54.616 --> 00:58:55.517]  Okay, News Corp.
[00:58:56.198 --> 00:58:59.160]  The parent company has published, If I Did It, by O.J.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.661]  Simpson, who, frankly, I think he did it.
[00:59:01.701 --> 00:59:02.541]  Everybody knows he did it.
[00:59:02.742 --> 00:59:04.482]  The guy's not writing books about how he did it.
[00:59:05.223 --> 00:59:10.506]  Quote, hypothetically, give me a break with a thin veil there, because of double jeopardy, which I agree with.
[00:59:10.526 --> 00:59:15.648]  It lets a few killers like him go, but at least it protects innocent people from the tyranny of government.
[00:59:15.929 --> 00:59:22.072]  It'd be better than ten guilty men go free than one innocent man hang, goes the old saying by some British lord, I forget exactly who.
[00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.611]  So, so, this is sick.
[00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:30.932]  I mean, they're making money, hyping, and O'Reilly and all of them, and Geraldo, that's all staged.
[00:59:30.952 --> 00:59:36.253]  I know people that work at Fox, they've told me, where they come out and attack Rupert Murdoch, and attack the TV show.
[00:59:36.413 --> 00:59:37.533]  That just makes more people tune in.
[00:59:37.553 --> 00:59:38.974]  In fact, they don't care right now!
[00:59:39.214 --> 00:59:40.714]  They cynically know I'll talk about it.
[00:59:40.914 --> 00:59:42.895]  Every other talk show host in America will talk about it.
[00:59:43.135 --> 00:59:47.476]  And idiot Americans, I'm not saying we're all idiots, but Americans who do it are idiots,
[00:59:47.976 --> 00:59:49.577]  Are gonna go out and buy that book.
[00:59:49.737 --> 00:59:50.938]  I wouldn't read that book.
[00:59:51.218 --> 00:59:53.660]  I wouldn't buy that book for all the tea in China.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.881]  Trey, what about you?
[00:59:54.901 --> 00:59:58.783]  I mean, this is sick, said Negative.
[00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:02.226]  This is totally and completely sick and disgusting.
[01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:14.634]  So, so these are the whores, the whores that will publish books of killers talking about how they slit their wife's throat and their children have to read that and they've got the nerve when I put my films out for free
[01:00:16.095 --> 01:00:17.656]  I mean, I'm thinking about the end of my life, folks.
[01:00:17.716 --> 01:00:18.676]  I probably won't be killed.
[01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.157]  I probably won't be arrested, but I could be.
[01:00:20.197 --> 01:00:21.298]  I get death threats all the time.
[01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:23.099]  I mean, I made a sacrifice doing this.
[01:00:23.759 --> 01:00:25.560]  I've been doing this out in the wilderness forever.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.382]  I could care less about money and power.
[01:00:28.562 --> 01:00:32.644]  We're doing this for the right reasons, and they've got the nerve to sit there and say that.
[01:00:32.684 --> 01:00:40.008]  Then they claim we live in shacks and we're liars, but every time we try to bring up facts, they shout us down and yell over us, and will never counter any of our facts, because they can't.
[01:00:41.187 --> 01:00:44.729]  Now, the more sophisticated attack pieces, like by Popular Mechanics, they build straw men.
[01:00:45.089 --> 01:00:55.494]  They say we said things, or things we never said, and then attack the falsehoods and prove them false, or they go find kooks who are saying ridiculous things about 9-11 being an inside job, and then attack them.
[01:00:56.955 --> 01:00:58.116]  Okay, this is how they operate.
[01:00:58.276 --> 01:00:59.236]  That's more sophisticated.
[01:00:59.476 --> 01:01:03.338]  This Fox News stuff, and then everybody who's been on there, it's the same thing.
[01:01:03.358 --> 01:01:05.219]  They scream at you, they yell at you, they talk over you.
[01:01:05.519 --> 01:01:06.740]  At least Mancow Muller,
[01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:09.674]  Allowed Kevin to talk some.
[01:01:09.694 --> 01:01:10.656]  In fact, he talked quite a bit.
[01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:14.962]  They double teamed him, but still he did get to talk quite a lot.
[01:01:15.603 --> 01:01:22.494]  Now the other big piece of propaganda that they ran is that they claim that the firefighters disagree with us and we're hurting the firefighters.
[01:01:22.894 --> 01:01:24.975]  What does that have to do with the firefighters who carried out 9-11?
[01:01:25.135 --> 01:01:26.136]  They're heroes regardless.
[01:01:26.176 --> 01:01:27.157]  They went into that building.
[01:01:27.457 --> 01:01:28.397]  They went in to save people.
[01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:29.258]  They did a great job.
[01:01:29.618 --> 01:01:31.599]  What does that have to do with 9-11 being an inside job?
[01:01:31.739 --> 01:01:35.281]  Then they try to say that, well, we just say America's bad now and America's gone.
[01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:39.403]  And then Kevin says, well, Thomas Jefferson said that you shouldn't trust the government.
[01:01:39.804 --> 01:01:41.845]  And the firefighter goes, I don't believe that.
[01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:43.985]  I went and pulled up hundreds of quotes.
[01:01:44.185 --> 01:01:45.126]  All the founders said it.
[01:01:45.466 --> 01:01:46.646]  Yes, keep government small.
[01:01:46.706 --> 01:01:47.366]  Don't trust it.
[01:01:47.566 --> 01:01:48.306]  It'll get out of hand.
[01:01:48.346 --> 01:01:49.207]  It'll get out of control.
[01:01:49.467 --> 01:01:50.307]  Power corrupts absolutely.
[01:01:50.327 --> 01:01:51.207]  Power corrupts absolutely.
[01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:53.708]  I repeated what Lord Acton in England had said around the time.
[01:01:54.948 --> 01:02:00.989]  So again, it also shows a massive wall of ignorance about what's really happening in the world.
[01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:06.530]  So when we get back from this break, we're going to play about eight minutes of this or so.
[01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:08.771]  And I'm going to play a stupid intro.
[01:02:09.403 --> 01:02:18.311]  And then we'll comment on it when we come back after the bottom of the hour news, and then we'll go straight to John, Garrett, Brown, and many others.
[01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:26.638]  But the reason we play this is not because I was on national television or one of my employees, one of my reporters was, a reporter and radio producer.
[01:02:27.159 --> 01:02:28.460]  We all do multitasking.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.262]  I'm chief cook and bottle washer.
[01:02:30.302 --> 01:02:31.623]  I write articles, edit video.
[01:02:32.398 --> 01:02:33.039]  Pay the bills.
[01:02:33.139 --> 01:02:34.060]  Carry out the trash.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.381]  Well, Kevin does the same thing.
[01:02:35.861 --> 01:02:38.004]  And people get confused by him being a reporter and a radio producer.
[01:02:38.024 --> 01:02:38.724]  All right.
[01:02:38.804 --> 01:02:40.406]  We'll be right back with this.
[01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:42.448]  You'll want to stay with us and your calls.
[01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:49.695]  Blasting out worldwide from right here in Central Texas, from the studios of NewsRadio 590K, it'll be JInfoWars.com is the website.
[01:02:51.295 --> 01:02:53.998]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:03:44.038 --> 01:03:44.318]  Do it today!
[01:03:44.338 --> 01:03:46.559]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:03:57.654 --> 01:04:02.477]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:04:02.678 --> 01:04:05.419]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:06.580]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:12.524]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:04:13.445 --> 01:04:20.710]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:24.753]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:30.368]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:32.590]  Call for your copy today.
[01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:35.071]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:36.132 --> 01:04:41.975]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:04:42.676 --> 01:04:43.076]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:43.316]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:51.632 --> 01:04:55.213]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:04:55.473 --> 01:04:56.334]  Look no further!
[01:04:56.634 --> 01:04:59.195]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:04:59.635 --> 01:05:08.118]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:08.538]  You can
[01:05:08.598 --> 01:05:08.838]  I think so.
[01:05:25.882 --> 01:05:26.422]  I think so.
[01:05:53.126 --> 01:05:57.267]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.248]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:05:59.508 --> 01:06:05.790]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:12.211]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:12.451 --> 01:06:14.292]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:14.492 --> 01:06:15.413]  We're good to go.
[01:06:37.072 --> 01:06:38.752]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.740]  Agree or disagree?
[01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:10.001]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:15.042]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.243 --> 01:07:17.703]  That's right.
[01:07:17.743 --> 01:07:21.844]  Without further ado, this is kind of like a little compilation we grabbed off TV and threw up on the web.
[01:07:21.884 --> 01:07:22.944]  I should have brought an actual disc.
[01:07:23.024 --> 01:07:24.984]  It'd sound a little bit better, but it's okay quality-wise.
[01:07:25.545 --> 01:07:29.865]  This is Mankow introducing the show, then a little clip of him interviewing Shatner before he goes to us.
[01:07:30.366 --> 01:07:32.286]  We were the number two lineup on the show.
[01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:35.583]  Other stuff was some mindless fluff about YouTube.
[01:07:35.643 --> 01:07:40.986]  Now TV and radio is trying to imitate the internet and do shows covering the web.
[01:07:41.006 --> 01:07:42.707]  So the rest of the show was about that.
[01:07:42.727 --> 01:07:43.407]  And they better do that.
[01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:47.329]  These dinosaurs better do it because their days are numbered here in the media.
[01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:57.916]  But let's go ahead and go to the Planet Man Cow hit piece on Fox News special against my producer Kevin Smith in studio with him and a poor firefighter.
[01:07:57.956 --> 01:07:58.256]  Here he is.
[01:08:08.656 --> 01:08:16.281]  This is crazy!
[01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:16.782]  No!
[01:08:16.862 --> 01:08:17.122]  Wait!
[01:08:17.222 --> 01:08:17.742]  Stop!
[01:08:17.842 --> 01:08:18.983]  Don't adjust your television!
[01:08:19.003 --> 01:08:21.485]  The internet or the voices in your head.
[01:08:21.705 --> 01:08:23.326]  You're still watching the Fox News Channel.
[01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.848]  But you're about to enter a parallel universe.
[01:08:26.088 --> 01:08:27.049]  Planet Mankow.
[01:08:28.244 --> 01:08:28.924]  I'm man cow.
[01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:30.865]  I don't know what it means either.
[01:08:30.905 --> 01:08:32.745]  My mom calls me Eric or son.
[01:08:33.365 --> 01:08:34.705]  Look, I'm not the king of pop.
[01:08:34.765 --> 01:08:36.165]  I'm not the king of all media.
[01:08:36.205 --> 01:08:38.226]  I don't have talent on loan from God.
[01:08:38.666 --> 01:08:41.706]  I'm just some guy that wants to give you people the voice.
[01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:43.267]  I don't have all the answers.
[01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:44.467]  I don't claim to have all the answers.
[01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:49.868]  Many times I feel like Frankenstein walking blindly through the fog trying to figure it all out.
[01:08:50.108 --> 01:08:52.768]  There's a lot of confusing stuff going on on our planet right now.
[01:08:53.449 --> 01:08:55.869]  But a lot of funny stuff as well and thank God.
[01:08:56.957 --> 01:09:01.080]  I hope to bring a little bit of both in the next hour here on Planet Man Cow.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.801]  What is the scariest word to you?
[01:09:04.422 --> 01:09:04.702]  Hate.
[01:09:05.022 --> 01:09:05.302]  Hate?
[01:09:06.043 --> 01:09:06.283]  Death?
[01:09:07.403 --> 01:09:08.264]  Death is very scary.
[01:09:08.284 --> 01:09:09.144]  You're afraid of death?
[01:09:09.365 --> 01:09:09.845]  Very much so.
[01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:11.963]  Is there something after this?
[01:09:12.303 --> 01:09:14.584]  You know, I don't think there is something after this.
[01:09:14.604 --> 01:09:15.465]  That's the scary part.
[01:09:15.965 --> 01:09:19.027]  And coming up, your future in Signs of the Apocalypse.
[01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:27.651]  And we're going to take you to the grassy knoll where 9-11 conspiracists... Kevin Smith believes 9-11 was a secret government plot.
[01:09:28.012 --> 01:09:32.554]  And he's going to face off against a New York City firefighter that was actually there on that horrific day.
[01:09:32.834 --> 01:09:35.536]  Stay right there because Planet Man Cow will be right back.
[01:09:45.878 --> 01:09:47.179]  Conspiracy is big business.
[01:09:47.299 --> 01:09:50.440]  Conspiracy around 9-11 is huge business.
[01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:54.623]  You've got movies and t-shirts and DVDs and websites.
[01:09:55.203 --> 01:10:01.226]  And joining me here on the grassy knoll is Kevin Smith, who has one of those websites, Infowars.com, and a firefighter that was actually there.
[01:10:01.246 --> 01:10:02.807]  This thing is big business.
[01:10:03.167 --> 01:10:03.968]  This is Brian Harvey.
[01:10:04.008 --> 01:10:04.268]  Brian?
[01:10:04.949 --> 01:10:07.750]  What do you think about this guy making money off of this tragedy?
[01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:13.451]  Well, I can't say I support people making money off of the country's worst tragedy to hit our mainland.
[01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:29.034]  I just think that if people want to make movies or write books, with all the special attention that's made to detail and keeping the conspiracy theories and political rhetoric down and take it off the whole movie project or book project, there's nothing wrong with telling it how it went.
[01:10:29.294 --> 01:10:31.094]  It was an attack on our country by terrorists.
[01:10:33.013 --> 01:10:37.063]  They believe, they're passionate about what they believe, and they want other people to join on board with them.
[01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:37.865]  So you think he really believes this?
[01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:39.669]  You don't think he's just some nut trying to make a buck?
[01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:41.012]  I can't say that.
[01:10:41.032 --> 01:10:42.174]  I don't know him well enough to say that.
[01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:45.300]  Well, I can assure you I'm not getting rich over this.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.662]  I make a salary just like anybody else with a job.
[01:10:48.122 --> 01:10:52.025]  I report for InfoWars.com, Alex Jones' website and prison planet.
[01:10:52.306 --> 01:10:55.028]  But I'm mainly the producer of that show, which means I book the guests.
[01:10:55.048 --> 01:10:57.090]  So, I talk to these military people.
[01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.231]  I talk to these professors.
[01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:01.193]  I talk to these underwriter laboratories and civil engineers.
[01:11:01.653 --> 01:11:02.814]  And it's across the board.
[01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:07.598]  I mean, I'm not sure if you're aware, but CBS and the New York Times did a poll this month.
[01:11:07.938 --> 01:11:10.921]  53% of respondents say that the Bush administration is hiding.
[01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:12.322]  Something.
[01:11:12.682 --> 01:11:13.642]  28% say they're lying.
[01:11:13.982 --> 01:11:15.623]  I mean, you're over 80% now.
[01:11:16.143 --> 01:11:17.364]  This is not a fringe thing.
[01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:23.386]  A third of the people in a Scripps Howard News Service said, a third of the people said the government did it.
[01:11:23.906 --> 01:11:26.808]  Okay, this is not just a fringe conspiracy theory anymore.
[01:11:27.068 --> 01:11:28.488]  It's a conspiracy fact.
[01:11:29.028 --> 01:11:30.129]  And we can prove it to you.
[01:11:30.409 --> 01:11:31.389]  Go to the scientists.
[01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:32.570]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:34.570]  Google WTC7.
[01:11:34.751 --> 01:11:35.831]  Understand what that's about.
[01:11:35.951 --> 01:11:38.011]  Understand what false flag terrorism is about.
[01:11:38.452 --> 01:11:39.592]  How we orchestrate wars.
[01:11:39.612 --> 01:11:41.232]  We've been doing it for a long time.
[01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:41.852]  Not just us.
[01:11:42.092 --> 01:11:42.713]  Not saying U.S.
[01:11:42.753 --> 01:11:43.093]  government.
[01:11:43.293 --> 01:11:44.133]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[01:11:44.273 --> 01:11:49.795]  Can I ask you, then why isn't it out in the forum today with the 06 elections and all these other things?
[01:11:50.035 --> 01:11:51.795]  You know, is it an anti-President Bush thing?
[01:11:51.835 --> 01:11:53.375]  Is it an anti-United States thing?
[01:11:53.395 --> 01:11:54.236]  It is in the media!
[01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:54.656]  It is!
[01:11:55.496 --> 01:11:57.198]  Front and center on every major news program.
[01:11:57.218 --> 01:12:00.701]  I'm as pro-United States as I can be, but I don't swear an allegiance to a person.
[01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:05.865]  I swear my allegiance to the founding documents, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which have been eviscerated now.
[01:12:05.885 --> 01:12:08.488]  Why isn't that out in front right now?
[01:12:08.728 --> 01:12:09.288]  I don't hear about it.
[01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:10.589]  We're talking about mainstream media?
[01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:11.410]  I don't hear about it.
[01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:15.814]  The people that are just totally wrapped up in what Jen and Brad are doing constantly?
[01:12:16.194 --> 01:12:16.915]  It's not news.
[01:12:17.275 --> 01:12:17.996]  They control.
[01:12:18.216 --> 01:12:20.198]  Television is called programming for a reason.
[01:12:20.718 --> 01:12:22.380]  They want you to know what they want you to know.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:34.489]  But if President Bush was behind it or knew about it, if Vice President Cheney knew about it and was told to stand up, don't you think the mainstream media would expose that with all this proof that you have?
[01:12:34.509 --> 01:12:37.451]  NBC, that owns General Electric, that makes the engines, that makes the guns.
[01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:40.894]  But they have not been in this administration's corner for a long time.
[01:12:40.974 --> 01:12:41.634]  I have never seen it.
[01:12:41.654 --> 01:12:42.735]  It's always the other way around.
[01:12:43.936 --> 01:12:45.618]  The media attacks his presence for everything.
[01:12:45.838 --> 01:12:46.519]  He orchestrated 9-11.
[01:12:46.539 --> 01:12:48.741]  I don't see where you're getting that.
[01:12:48.822 --> 01:12:49.702]  There's a paradigm shift.
[01:12:49.743 --> 01:12:50.804]  They are attacking him now.
[01:12:51.044 --> 01:12:51.885]  But they weren't forever.
[01:12:52.065 --> 01:12:53.307]  He was getting card blocked.
[01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:54.468]  He could do whatever he wanted.
[01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:56.310]  And no one could question the leader.
[01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:58.913]  This government can't keep anything secret.
[01:12:59.722 --> 01:13:01.585]  They kept the Manhattan Project secret.
[01:13:01.605 --> 01:13:03.006]  Let's talk about 9-11.
[01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.308]  They kept 9-11 secret.
[01:13:04.348 --> 01:13:06.250]  How many people were involved?
[01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:07.131]  It's not a secret.
[01:13:07.172 --> 01:13:07.672]  How many people?
[01:13:08.633 --> 01:13:09.735]  It doesn't have to be very many.
[01:13:09.775 --> 01:13:11.958]  It just needs to be moles placed into the top.
[01:13:12.238 --> 01:13:13.519]  We had people in CENTCOM.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.422]  The colonels in Central Command were fighting.
[01:13:15.442 --> 01:13:16.163]  Is Hillary Clinton involved?
[01:13:16.773 --> 01:13:17.553]  Is Hillary involved?
[01:13:17.613 --> 01:13:19.254]  I doubt it.
[01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.034]  Listen, the Democrats aren't going to wreck the game.
[01:13:21.254 --> 01:13:25.776]  You know, monsters may shoot each other under the card table every once in a while, but if someone threatens that game, it will unify.
[01:13:25.896 --> 01:13:32.517]  So Hillary Clinton, you know, the Democrats and Bush and all the Republicans, they all got together to make 9-11 because it's big business.
[01:13:32.817 --> 01:13:35.438]  Intelligence agencies got together and worked together.
[01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:36.639]  They always have worked together.
[01:13:36.659 --> 01:13:39.159]  They don't work for their governments, they work for the banking interests.
[01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:40.059]  What if you're wrong?
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.120]  I'm not wrong.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:41.780]  What if you're wrong?
[01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:43.507]  What if I'm wrong?
[01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:45.410]  We're just going to continue to go down this path?
[01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:49.377]  We're going to start a war with anybody that has resources?
[01:13:49.538 --> 01:13:54.587]  You said to me off camera you love Thomas Jefferson, Abe Lincoln, this great country.
[01:13:56.258 --> 01:13:58.979]  If our government could do this, it makes all of this work.
[01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:00.120]  Elements within our government.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:00.760]  Yeah, elements.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.020]  Rogue elements like the President.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.221]  Look what they do to the Congress right now.
[01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:04.281]  They want to pass a law.
[01:14:04.581 --> 01:14:05.722]  They say there's a terrorist threat.
[01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:09.583]  They show up in Congress and point machine guns in the Congressmen's face and say, Get out!
[01:14:10.063 --> 01:14:10.404]  Get out!
[01:14:10.604 --> 01:14:10.764]  When?
[01:14:10.784 --> 01:14:12.164]  When did they do this?
[01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:12.904]  I didn't see this.
[01:14:12.924 --> 01:14:13.585]  Machine guns?
[01:14:13.605 --> 01:14:15.205]  You better go see it.
[01:14:15.225 --> 01:14:15.686]  You're doing that?
[01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:16.906]  MP5s, baby.
[01:14:16.946 --> 01:14:18.327]  You better go see it.
[01:14:18.407 --> 01:14:19.387]  And the terrorists are alive?
[01:14:20.347 --> 01:14:23.289]  They worked with the CIA, you believe.
[01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.750]  These are patsies.
[01:14:24.971 --> 01:14:30.214]  Listen, they were trained at the Defense Language School in Monterey, California.
[01:14:30.414 --> 01:14:33.817]  The terrorists that we see on TV were trained by our government.
[01:14:33.857 --> 01:14:35.678]  Yes, they're intelligence assets.
[01:14:36.018 --> 01:14:37.179]  Ask actor James Woods.
[01:14:37.419 --> 01:14:39.460]  He saw Otta on the plane a couple weeks before 9-11.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.661]  Well, that's where I go for my info.
[01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:42.903]  That's where I got my info, is actor James Woods.
[01:14:42.963 --> 01:14:44.764]  The guy that plays Shark on a failed TV show.
[01:14:44.784 --> 01:14:45.604]  It's an eyewitness.
[01:14:45.644 --> 01:14:46.245]  What about Bigfoot?
[01:14:48.171 --> 01:14:48.612]  You heard him.
[01:14:48.973 --> 01:14:49.995]  You heard him right there.
[01:14:51.197 --> 01:14:54.243]  Basically throwing the kitchen sink at Kevin.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:01.443]  Now, actor James Woods was an art source of the news reports that hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:15:01.483 --> 01:15:02.284]  military bases.
[01:15:02.304 --> 01:15:11.108]  That was the Associated Press, Newsweek, MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal, and the San Jose Mercury News.
[01:15:11.148 --> 01:15:12.349]  And I have those all in my films.
[01:15:12.689 --> 01:15:13.890]  I've talked to the dean of the school.
[01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:16.911]  They trained the hijackers in high-level spy training.
[01:15:17.371 --> 01:15:23.094]  Then, across the country, leave California and go all the way to Florida, Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:15:23.114 --> 01:15:24.555]  Then, separately, James Woods
[01:15:25.925 --> 01:15:29.769]  A week before the attack, saw him doing dry runs on board aircraft.
[01:15:29.809 --> 01:15:30.990]  Again, taking part in drills.
[01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.611]  They were U.S.
[01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:31.971]  agents.
[01:15:32.472 --> 01:15:33.773]  They thought they were taking part in a drill.
[01:15:33.953 --> 01:15:35.054]  They weren't actually hijackers.
[01:15:35.455 --> 01:15:36.816]  Nerve gas was released on the day.
[01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:38.898]  The jets were flown by remote control in the buildings.
[01:15:39.318 --> 01:15:44.163]  Just like you saw Steve McQueen pitching Mustangs, they created fake audio.
[01:15:44.363 --> 01:15:45.004]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:45.024 --> 01:15:45.404]  Stay with us.
[01:15:51.772 --> 01:15:52.332]  Hey, Emily!
[01:15:52.612 --> 01:15:53.513]  Wow, you look great!
[01:15:53.853 --> 01:15:54.674]  I feel great!
[01:15:54.914 --> 01:15:56.855]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:15:57.215 --> 01:15:57.515]  Really?
[01:15:57.735 --> 01:15:58.155]  What is it?
[01:15:58.295 --> 01:15:58.756]  How does it work?
[01:15:58.896 --> 01:16:05.339]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and betonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:07.720]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:13.023]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:16:13.343 --> 01:16:13.803]  That's it?
[01:16:14.044 --> 01:16:15.625]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:16:15.825 --> 01:16:16.545]  It is easy.
[01:16:16.745 --> 01:16:23.390]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:24.991]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:16:25.191 --> 01:16:25.992]  That's amazing!
[01:16:26.312 --> 01:16:31.676]  And, the benzenite clay in MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:32.236]  Wow!
[01:16:32.416 --> 01:16:33.477]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?

[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:57.801]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:16:58.382 --> 01:17:00.862]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the
[01:17:04.568 --> 01:17:07.870]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:03.413]  Working Group, what they've recommended, and how it's more of the same.
[01:21:03.453 --> 01:21:07.895]  I want to cover several other issues and take your calls, but let's finish up with the Fox News hit piece.
[01:21:07.955 --> 01:21:08.795]  This isn't all of it.
[01:21:09.135 --> 01:21:26.860]  We don't have time to play all of it, but basically he just kept calling Kevin names, kept calling my producer names, wouldn't let him get to any real evidence, just kept calling him a liar, and then said, oh, basically America's dead if what you're saying is true, implying somehow that not trusting your government,
[01:21:28.527 --> 01:21:30.488]  Also, they say that they couldn't keep it secret.
[01:21:30.528 --> 01:21:36.651]  They kept the fact that they gave thousands of black men syphilis and let them die of it and spread it with the Tuskegee experiment.
[01:21:37.012 --> 01:21:39.053]  They kept that secret for over 40 years.
[01:21:40.405 --> 01:21:45.068]  Okay, they kept the fact that they sterilized 450,000 American women secretly.
[01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:48.991]  Sometimes without them even knowing they'd been sterilized until the mid-eighties.
[01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.112]  They kept the atomic soldiers secret.
[01:21:51.192 --> 01:21:52.713]  I'm sick of hearing this!
[01:21:52.913 --> 01:21:54.474]  There's a whole secret government!
[01:21:54.754 --> 01:21:58.637]  I was talking about the shadow government 12 years ago, now it's mainstream news!
[01:21:59.417 --> 01:22:05.201]  And that's why they're upset, that's why they're scared, because the average person is good and is going to get angry when they learn the truth.
[01:22:05.481 --> 01:22:08.523]  Let's go ahead and go to the rest of the Fox News hit piece against us last night.
[01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:11.472]  You have info on Bigfoot?
[01:22:11.592 --> 01:22:12.673]  The Loch Ness Monster?
[01:22:12.693 --> 01:22:14.874]  Who brought down the Hindenburgian UFO?
[01:22:15.074 --> 01:22:18.155]  Those are the wrong people!
[01:22:18.315 --> 01:22:22.356]  I don't see any officials coming out saying this, any former government officials.
[01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:24.097]  We can't believe in our government?
[01:22:24.157 --> 01:22:26.658]  We have no right to believe our democratically elected leaders?
[01:22:26.678 --> 01:22:29.199]  Our Founding Fathers would never believe in your government.
[01:22:29.359 --> 01:22:30.700]  Never trust in your government.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.200]  Who said that?
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.720]  Our Founding Fathers would say that.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.301]  What does it say?
[01:22:34.381 --> 01:22:35.081]  The New World Order?
[01:22:35.101 --> 01:22:35.742]  Don't you see it?
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.741]  They want us all to be slaves.
[01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:40.482]  On the new global plantation.
[01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:40.903]  You got it.
[01:22:40.943 --> 01:22:42.124]  A global plantation.
[01:22:42.404 --> 01:22:43.965]  And this guy's a sucker.
[01:22:43.985 --> 01:22:45.906]  This firefighter's a sucker.
[01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:47.308]  He's a dude.
[01:22:47.448 --> 01:22:48.989]  He's a fool.
[01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:51.531]  If everything you're saying is true, this man's a fool.
[01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:53.452]  He just hasn't woken up yet, but he soon will.
[01:22:53.472 --> 01:22:55.094]  He hasn't woken up yet, but he soon will.
[01:22:55.354 --> 01:22:56.295]  Thank you, Mr. Orwell.
[01:22:57.095 --> 01:22:58.997]  We'll be right back here on the grassy knoll.
[01:23:06.918 --> 01:23:08.019]  Do you believe everything you read?
[01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:08.660]  You can't.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.500]  Not on the internet.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.022]  Not on the world wide web of disinformation.
[01:23:12.283 --> 01:23:14.925]  From time to time we're going to point out lies on the internet.
[01:23:15.305 --> 01:23:18.387]  Hey, did you know I was the star of Alien vs. Predator?
[01:23:19.008 --> 01:23:19.428]  It's true.
[01:23:19.448 --> 01:23:20.409]  It was on the internet.
[01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.431]  I've never even seen the movie.
[01:23:29.276 --> 01:23:32.098]  And welcome back to the Grassy Knoll here on Planet Man Cow.
[01:23:32.279 --> 01:23:36.362]  Kevin Smith here believes 9-11 was a conspiracy done by our government.
[01:23:37.154 --> 01:23:39.895]  This is a firefighter, Brian Harvey, who was there.
[01:23:40.455 --> 01:23:41.315]  What do you think of this guy?
[01:23:41.335 --> 01:23:42.395]  What do you think about what he's saying?
[01:23:42.735 --> 01:23:43.495]  I don't believe it.
[01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:49.977]  I think there's been more than enough opportunity for the 9-11 Commission and other committees to investigate this.
[01:23:50.977 --> 01:23:54.978]  If this had any legs, if this story had any credibility, it would have came out.
[01:23:55.438 --> 01:23:56.598]  Why is he doing this?
[01:23:56.658 --> 01:23:57.598]  Why do you think he's doing this?
[01:23:57.618 --> 01:23:58.118]  He believes it.
[01:23:58.198 --> 01:24:01.199]  He thinks he has some... Do you think he's crazy?
[01:24:01.859 --> 01:24:02.499]  I wouldn't say crazy.
[01:24:02.519 --> 01:24:03.140]  Look at his eyes.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:03.720]  Passionate.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:04.320]  Look at his eyes.
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.901]  Do you guys want to arm wrestle and we can settle this right here, right now?
[01:24:06.921 --> 01:24:07.281]  Maybe later.
[01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:09.101]  Maybe at the end.
[01:24:09.321 --> 01:24:10.982]  He said it was like a scab being ripped off.
[01:24:11.062 --> 01:24:12.142]  Do you feel anything for this guy?
[01:24:12.662 --> 01:24:14.803]  We have nothing but the utmost respect for firefighters.
[01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.484]  They're the number one heroes for us in the United States.
[01:24:18.144 --> 01:24:24.006]  And we do a lot of work right now with the victims, the people that helped to rescue, the EMS workers that went in, that are dying right now.
[01:24:24.026 --> 01:24:29.968]  I mean, Christy Todd Whitman lied about the air quality, lied about the silica, lied about the mercury, everything.
[01:24:30.008 --> 01:24:31.468]  These people are dead men.
[01:24:31.848 --> 01:24:33.049]  There's no doubt people are getting sick.
[01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:35.169]  This guy can't be a firefighter because of his lungs.
[01:24:35.389 --> 01:24:36.070]  How are you right now?
[01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:37.790]  I have my days, good days and bad days.
[01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:40.511]  Do you feel like they were lied to and they should have told you how bad it was?
[01:24:40.871 --> 01:24:44.855]  No, I feel that they didn't know and that things were coming out.
[01:24:44.935 --> 01:24:45.655]  Would you do it again?
[01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:47.997]  Would you climb down into the wreckage again?
[01:24:48.017 --> 01:24:49.259]  That's what firemen do.
[01:24:49.299 --> 01:24:50.239]  Police officers do that.
[01:24:50.299 --> 01:24:51.761]  They put their lives on the line every day.
[01:24:51.781 --> 01:24:52.942]  Go ahead.
[01:24:53.202 --> 01:24:57.246]  Well, we can bring you William Rodriguez, one of the janitors from the World Trade Center, the last man to get out.
[01:24:57.286 --> 01:24:58.427]  I can bring you Stephen Jenkins.
[01:24:58.467 --> 01:24:59.668]  Do you know who that is?
[01:24:59.688 --> 01:25:00.268]  Give me Stephen Jenkins.
[01:25:00.288 --> 01:25:00.889]  The janitor here.
[01:25:01.616 --> 01:25:06.018]  Well, did he have the building come down on him when he pulled out from under a fire truck?
[01:25:06.078 --> 01:25:08.839]  Did he win a Presidential Freedom Award for being a hero?
[01:25:09.019 --> 01:25:11.800]  He will tell you bombs going off in the building.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.821]  Felipe David with skin peeling off of him coming up from the sub-basements.
[01:25:17.142 --> 01:25:19.262]  They were cutting those basements out before.
[01:25:19.542 --> 01:25:22.403]  It is a controlled demolition incorporated.
[01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:23.864]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:25:24.364 --> 01:25:30.228]  There was thermite cutting charges to cut and take that building down.
[01:25:30.528 --> 01:25:35.811]  The debris that was falling from the higher floors was still falling as the building was coming out from under it.
[01:25:36.152 --> 01:25:38.353]  It fell at pre-fall speed.
[01:25:38.413 --> 01:25:39.234]  No pancake.
[01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:42.015]  Explain to him what happened.
[01:25:42.976 --> 01:25:45.738]  Just from my firefighting experience, everything you get taught is...
[01:25:47.979 --> 01:25:49.820]  Have you seen a building come down like that before?
[01:26:08.835 --> 01:26:10.476]  No one has, because it's never happened.
[01:26:10.516 --> 01:26:12.417]  And the bigger question is WTC7.
[01:26:12.858 --> 01:26:13.898]  Not hit by a plane.
[01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:15.419]  Not hit by debris.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:16.560]  Small fires.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.742]  At the end of the afternoon, they pull the firemen out and they pull the building down.
[01:26:19.762 --> 01:26:20.903]  They brought that building down for insurance, right?
[01:26:20.923 --> 01:26:22.444]  Do you believe they brought that down to collect insurance?
[01:26:22.464 --> 01:26:23.465]  Hey, ask Mr. Silverstein.
[01:26:23.505 --> 01:26:24.305]  Get him on the show.
[01:26:24.325 --> 01:26:25.046]  He's the one with the facts.
[01:26:25.066 --> 01:26:26.507]  You're talking about Andrew Dice Silverstein, the comedian?
[01:26:27.127 --> 01:26:27.467]  Uh, no.
[01:26:27.507 --> 01:26:28.448]  Larry Silverstein.
[01:26:28.588 --> 01:26:28.948]  Okay.
[01:26:28.968 --> 01:26:31.450]  So, so, the buildings, why were the buildings brought down?
[01:26:32.225 --> 01:26:34.686]  Well, you might ask the Port Authority, too.
[01:26:34.906 --> 01:26:35.647]  I got you here!
[01:26:36.027 --> 01:26:36.727]  You're the expert!
[01:26:36.827 --> 01:26:37.107]  Why?
[01:26:37.127 --> 01:26:38.788]  I didn't do this!
[01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:41.490]  Alright, folks, there's a few minutes left.
[01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:42.630]  We don't have time to play it all.
[01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:51.275]  I want to go to break, hurriedly take some calls, and get into the whole Iraq situation, and then a silver lining of good news overall here in this country for the Republic.
[01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:55.337]  But, I mean, I was sitting here writing notes during that piece, listening to it again.
[01:26:55.657 --> 01:26:59.979]  He claims Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, they throw all that at Kevin,
[01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:04.047]  Trying to discredit him when that's not what he's saying, that's not what he's talking about.
[01:27:04.388 --> 01:27:08.893]  Every time he brings up real issues, the Fox News host starts shouting him down.
[01:27:08.913 --> 01:27:13.118]  And then Kevin brings up that the Founding Fathers said, don't trust your government.
[01:27:13.579 --> 01:27:15.061]  And the fireman goes, I never heard that.
[01:27:15.121 --> 01:27:15.782]  What's your proof?
[01:27:15.802 --> 01:27:16.783]  You're just making that up.
[01:27:17.409 --> 01:27:21.932]  I mean, for somebody who studies the Constitution, the Founding Fathers, that's all they ever said!
[01:27:22.232 --> 01:27:32.859]  It's so alien to people who are informed to realize to that guy, this good, well-meaning firefighter, he thinks patriotism is mindlessly believing whatever you're told!
[01:27:32.879 --> 01:27:35.801]  And then he brings up steel melting points.
[01:27:35.841 --> 01:27:36.982]  Get the next clip ready, please.
[01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:38.755]  Steel melting points.
[01:27:38.855 --> 01:27:41.658]  I've interviewed over 15 firefighters over the years.
[01:27:41.738 --> 01:27:43.220]  I've interviewed engineers.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.321]  I've interviewed eyewitnesses.
[01:27:44.341 --> 01:27:45.422]  I've interviewed janitors.
[01:27:45.462 --> 01:27:48.005]  I've interviewed the heads of mining colleges.
[01:27:48.665 --> 01:27:49.406]  Steel melts.
[01:27:49.446 --> 01:27:53.731]  Just type the melt point of steel at its lowest alloy at 2754 degrees.
[01:27:58.018 --> 01:28:04.683]  The strongest structural steel doesn't melt until 3,300 plus degrees.
[01:28:04.723 --> 01:28:06.784]  Just go type it into Google right now.
[01:28:07.204 --> 01:28:09.245]  You know what the hottest jet fuel burns at?
[01:28:09.265 --> 01:28:10.786]  1,800 degrees.
[01:28:10.806 --> 01:28:14.829]  Thousands of degrees below what it takes.
[01:28:17.239 --> 01:28:24.368]  Dark, orange, cool fires burning people for 20 minutes, standing in the holes, close to the hottest fires, waving for help.
[01:28:24.648 --> 01:28:27.111]  Wasn't melting their bodies, but melted huge columns.
[01:28:27.391 --> 01:28:29.614]  Then you got building 7 down the street, hit by nothing.
[01:28:29.914 --> 01:28:33.399]  Small fires bring it down perfectly in a top-down.
[01:28:33.579 --> 01:28:34.360]  Do you have that next clip?
[01:28:35.129 --> 01:28:38.791]  This is firefighters on a local New York PBS documentary.
[01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:43.613]  This is a firefighting captain talking about steel melting and flowing like lava.
[01:28:43.793 --> 01:28:44.793]  We also have video of it.
[01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:46.014]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[01:28:46.314 --> 01:28:47.935]  You know how you have that grate in your fireplace?
[01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:51.336]  You can burn hot, white, hot coals for 20 years on it and nothing melts?
[01:28:51.596 --> 01:28:52.957]  That's not structural steel, folks.
[01:28:52.997 --> 01:28:55.458]  That's just iron that melts at 2200.
[01:28:56.519 --> 01:28:56.959]  Okay?
[01:28:57.239 --> 01:29:00.981]  Giant, four-foot-a-round steel beams like lava from jet fuel!
[01:29:02.046 --> 01:29:03.246]  Only Thermite!
[01:29:03.666 --> 01:29:05.107]  Play the clip of the firefighters!
[01:29:05.987 --> 01:29:06.667]  Oh, we gotta go break.
[01:29:06.687 --> 01:29:07.507]  We come back, we'll play it.
[01:29:08.348 --> 01:29:09.728]  Oh, I'm just blowing up here.
[01:29:10.368 --> 01:29:14.549]  It is simple, basic information.
[01:29:15.489 --> 01:29:17.590]  John, Garrett, Brown, and others will get to you afterwards.
[01:29:17.630 --> 01:29:18.410]  It's a 30-second clip.
[01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.230]  It's not like the other one.
[01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:24.292]  And then I'll get into the Iraq news with the Iraq study group report.
[01:29:24.352 --> 01:29:25.852]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:27.831]  And then some really good news.
[01:29:28.011 --> 01:29:30.292]  So, big finish, big final segment.
[01:29:30.852 --> 01:29:35.435]  By the way, Terror Storm has been in the top 100 on Amazon for 3 weeks.
[01:29:35.695 --> 01:29:36.835]  It's gone as high as number 9.
[01:29:37.055 --> 01:29:41.478]  I think it finally left the top 100 today, but it'll be back in there.
[01:29:41.998 --> 01:29:44.700]  New film, free at Google Video, Terror Storm.
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:45.440]  Stay with us!
[01:29:52.106 --> 01:29:53.747]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:29:53.827 --> 01:29:54.607]  What's wrong?
[01:29:54.627 --> 01:29:55.828]  I am so tired.
[01:29:55.888 --> 01:29:58.350]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:59.591]  I have tried everything.
[01:29:59.651 --> 01:30:01.412]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:30:01.552 --> 01:30:02.713]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:05.134]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:30:05.294 --> 01:30:06.855]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:30:07.076 --> 01:30:09.157]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:30:09.257 --> 01:30:11.458]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:30:11.659 --> 01:30:12.159]  The what?
[01:30:12.439 --> 01:30:14.500]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.

[01:30:21.385 --> 01:30:22.205]  I think so.
[01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:52.540]  Did you know you have been cheated?

[01:30:59.984 --> 01:31:01.485]  The banks are defrauding you.

[01:34:13.674 --> 01:34:14.595]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:24.744]  Alright, going to your call in just a moment.
[01:34:24.965 --> 01:34:31.777]  As I was saying, steel melts between 2700 and 3300 degrees depending on the alloy.
[01:34:31.817 --> 01:34:32.578]  Structural at 3300.
[01:34:35.071 --> 01:34:36.772]  And then down to the lower grades of steel.
[01:34:36.852 --> 01:34:39.153]  Well, this is structural steel coated in asbestos.
[01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.754]  But forget Tower 1 and 2.
[01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:43.715]  We have Building 7 clearly being blown up, hit by nothing.
[01:34:43.755 --> 01:34:54.301]  But here are New York firefighters, including a New York fire captain from a New York documentary on local PBS, talking about the steel melting like lava.
[01:34:54.661 --> 01:34:55.041]  Okay?
[01:34:55.441 --> 01:34:57.122]  Impossible from jet fuel.
[01:34:57.462 --> 01:34:58.083]  Here's the clip.
[01:34:58.583 --> 01:34:59.804]  I think he just did it to...
[01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:05.292]  Who knew?
[01:35:06.112 --> 01:35:09.134]  To be honest with you, I think he might have thought that was it for us, though.
[01:35:10.294 --> 01:35:13.115]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel.
[01:35:14.555 --> 01:35:16.576]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[01:35:18.237 --> 01:35:19.337]  Like you're in a foundry.
[01:35:21.098 --> 01:35:21.358]  Yeah.
[01:35:21.498 --> 01:35:21.798]  Like lava.
[01:35:21.818 --> 01:35:23.079]  Like lava in a volcano.
[01:35:23.119 --> 01:35:24.999]  There wasn't a lot of screaming.
[01:35:25.039 --> 01:35:25.980]  There wasn't a lot of yelling.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.581]  Alright, so like a foundry, like a volcano.
[01:35:30.595 --> 01:35:39.098]  For those that don't know what a foundry is, it's where they melt and produce with iron, and other metals, steel, and the coke they inject into it.
[01:35:40.199 --> 01:35:41.859]  You need to find out the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:41.879 --> 01:35:42.920]  Those buildings were blown up.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:50.242]  And when they tested some of the steel that they were able to get that hadn't been destroyed and shipped to China, it didn't just have thermite in it, it had been cut with thermate.
[01:35:51.603 --> 01:35:53.984]  The patented thermite used to cut pillars.
[01:35:54.204 --> 01:35:56.585]  They have jackets of it they put around the steel.
[01:35:56.785 --> 01:35:57.565]  Only thermite
[01:35:58.539 --> 01:35:59.759]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to
[01:36:19.022 --> 01:36:20.082]  Well, that was a good call.
[01:36:20.382 --> 01:36:21.803]  Is that like a joke or something?
[01:36:21.843 --> 01:36:23.103]  I just wanted to click.
[01:36:23.823 --> 01:36:25.563]  He probably picked up another phone line and did that.
[01:36:26.164 --> 01:36:28.044]  Garrett in Cincinnati, you're on the air.
[01:36:28.084 --> 01:36:28.424]  Welcome.
[01:36:28.944 --> 01:36:29.404]  Hey, Alex.
[01:36:29.764 --> 01:36:29.984]  Hi.
[01:36:30.004 --> 01:36:32.185]  I just want to encourage you, man.
[01:36:32.285 --> 01:36:40.527]  I know a lot of criticians come at you and give you a bunch of doctrine, but I know that you're doing a good job, but on to my subject now.
[01:36:41.593 --> 01:36:48.237]  I was watching an old show of you on your Alex Jones Report talking about Illuminati symbolism.
[01:36:48.617 --> 01:36:49.478]  Yes, it's everywhere.
[01:36:49.918 --> 01:36:51.179]  Yeah, it is.
[01:36:51.219 --> 01:36:54.101]  When you were looking at the coffee cups and you're just like, I can't believe it.
[01:36:54.841 --> 01:36:55.322]  Well, that's right.
[01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:59.204]  If you go into Starbucks, it's all seeing ice pyramids, people doing the devil sign.
[01:36:59.484 --> 01:37:01.345]  And folks, I've been in Seattle and seen them doing it.
[01:37:01.385 --> 01:37:02.146]  It didn't hook them horns.
[01:37:02.725 --> 01:37:05.408]  And it's weird.
[01:37:05.688 --> 01:37:06.949]  Well, the symbol is a goddess.
[01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.890]  But sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:13.655]  Okay, now, I was watching TV, and you told me in this thing, you're like, just go watch TV, you can find it, just be aware.
[01:37:13.675 --> 01:37:21.102]  I was watching some news show, and they were talking about Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's wedding.
[01:37:21.522 --> 01:37:23.184]  And during the wedding vows,
[01:37:23.795 --> 01:37:27.538]  They make, Scientology, they make you take, the minister takes the ring.
[01:37:27.558 --> 01:37:31.381]  It's a gold ring with a triangle and that's the ultimate Illuminati symbol, yeah.
[01:37:31.641 --> 01:37:35.463]  No, and they get this, and then this was, I was expecting this.
[01:37:35.524 --> 01:37:37.325]  I have a family member who's in AA.
[01:37:38.866 --> 01:37:44.430]  The AA coins are circles with triangles with circles inside of them.
[01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:47.052]  Now, I'm not against AA.
[01:37:48.055 --> 01:37:53.645]  Well, the point is, it's so pervasive that we don't even know what it means, and that means the eye of Lucifer.
[01:37:56.556 --> 01:38:01.722]  You know, all these preachers that are going around, especially the big TV preachers, the big ones.
[01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:05.105]  Yeah, most of them are on drugs or homosexual.
[01:38:05.525 --> 01:38:07.267]  That hand signal they always do.
[01:38:07.347 --> 01:38:08.749]  I've seen them all do it.
[01:38:08.769 --> 01:38:12.313]  Jesse DePlantis, Pat Robertson, Billy Graham, Benny Hinn.
[01:38:12.333 --> 01:38:14.235]  I mean, what is with that?
[01:38:14.675 --> 01:38:19.280]  Like you said, sometimes they do it by accident, but man, I'm seeing them do it like they have a compulsion with it.
[01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:21.572]  I know, I know.
[01:38:21.592 --> 01:38:24.116]  They think they get power from it.
[01:38:24.156 --> 01:38:29.144]  And folks, I don't believe in this stuff, but it doesn't mean that people in Haiti don't believe in voodoo.
[01:38:29.204 --> 01:38:30.046]  I mean, they believe in it.
[01:38:30.066 --> 01:38:31.268]  So I'm just reporting.
[01:38:32.055 --> 01:38:34.136]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, you've heard of that?
[01:38:34.676 --> 01:38:35.236]  I've covered it.
[01:38:35.296 --> 01:38:36.076]  I've infiltrated it.
[01:38:36.736 --> 01:38:37.656]  I've got video of it.
[01:38:37.696 --> 01:38:38.897]  It's in my film, The Order of Death.
[01:38:38.937 --> 01:38:40.317]  It's aired on national U.S.
[01:38:40.357 --> 01:38:40.797]  television.
[01:38:40.837 --> 01:38:41.637]  It's aired worldwide.
[01:38:41.657 --> 01:38:43.858]  I mean, they admit I snuck in and got footage.
[01:38:43.878 --> 01:38:45.358]  They're very upset about it.
[01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:46.958]  You ever seen Eyes Wide Shut?
[01:38:47.339 --> 01:38:53.660]  Stanley Kubrick only made films about real things or things that were going on, and he would put it in a fictionalized account.
[01:38:54.358 --> 01:38:58.120]  Well, Eyes Wide Shut's real, folks, but they don't really like women.
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:00.201]  It's men with men.
[01:39:00.221 --> 01:39:03.063]  If you changed that in that movie, then you'd have it accurate.
[01:39:03.623 --> 01:39:06.104]  It's not women, normally.
[01:39:07.505 --> 01:39:10.987]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brown in Georgia.
[01:39:11.047 --> 01:39:12.208]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:39:12.228 --> 01:39:13.648]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:13.908 --> 01:39:14.149]  Hello.
[01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.749]  Go ahead, quickly.
[01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:18.491]  Yeah, I just want to say, Alex, man, I love what you do.
[01:39:18.851 --> 01:39:19.611]  I love your show.
[01:39:20.212 --> 01:39:24.513]  You're a real patriot and hero, and I mean, run for president, and I'll still vote for you.
[01:39:24.873 --> 01:39:26.074]  Okay, what else is on your mind?
[01:39:26.574 --> 01:39:29.895]  Well, just, you know, everything you do, man, it's just top-notch.
[01:39:30.535 --> 01:39:32.156]  You know, the neocons are out there.
[01:39:32.176 --> 01:39:37.298]  You know, probably, you know, 40-50% of Americans, they're just brainwashed by all this.
[01:39:37.358 --> 01:39:40.019]  They think Joseph Stalin's conservative.
[01:39:40.059 --> 01:39:40.839]  Yeah, they're that.
[01:39:42.173 --> 01:39:54.138]  And so, you know, if you look at, you know, the Pentagon, it's so absurd that people could actually fire them for one second that they don't have the film, the footage of that supposed plane coming into it.
[01:39:54.158 --> 01:39:55.619]  I mean, it's preposterous.
[01:39:56.419 --> 01:40:01.201]  You know, there's more cameras out there than you can find in a dozen Wolf camera stores.
[01:40:01.582 --> 01:40:02.882]  I agree, and I appreciate your call.
[01:40:03.122 --> 01:40:04.603]  Let's go to Todd in Corpus Christi.
[01:40:04.983 --> 01:40:05.723]  Todd, you're on the air.
[01:40:05.763 --> 01:40:06.344]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:06.364 --> 01:40:06.744]  Go ahead.
[01:40:07.384 --> 01:40:08.224]  Hi there, Mr. Jones.
[01:40:08.284 --> 01:40:09.225]  I just wanted a really quick
[01:40:10.029 --> 01:40:15.294]  I've been researching Charlotte Isselby for a class, and I stumbled upon the Center for Civic Education.
[01:40:15.354 --> 01:40:16.895]  Are you familiar with them?
[01:40:16.935 --> 01:40:18.657]  Yes, they have all over the country.
[01:40:18.697 --> 01:40:21.539]  I went and covered one of my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:35.352]  You can watch free at Google Video, America Destroyed by Design, with huge UN brainwashing camps, and they teach the children in every major public school that we're a global government, and we're going into the United Nations, and that we're the North American Union, and Texas belongs to Mexico.
[01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:39.839]  Right, and they are federally sanctioned to write our social studies curriculum.
[01:40:39.879 --> 01:40:41.140]  That's really how they're going to break it down.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:47.786]  Yeah, under UNESCO, that Bush signed back on under treaty, the UN has to certify all the textbooks.
[01:40:48.506 --> 01:40:50.268]  Yeah, have you even seen the cover of the textbook?
[01:40:51.328 --> 01:40:51.969]  There's a lot of them.
[01:40:51.989 --> 01:40:53.070]  I haven't seen it in a few years.
[01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:55.452]  There's one called, I think it's called, A Citizen in the Constitution.
[01:40:55.472 --> 01:41:01.216]  It has a picture of, as you're walking in to see a constitution, and it's got the security guard with his hands on his hips, like, don't come near it.
[01:41:01.416 --> 01:41:02.878]  I'd like to read you a couple quotes if I may.
[01:41:03.338 --> 01:41:04.199]  Yeah, we're almost out of time.
[01:41:04.219 --> 01:41:04.479]  Go ahead.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:16.106]  Okay, one of these says, as fundamental and lasting as its guarantees have been, the Bill of Rights is a document of the 18th century reflecting the issues and concerns of the age in which it was written.
[01:41:16.826 --> 01:41:21.849]  Yeah, do me a favor, make me some scans of that, email it to... To write your article, how about it?
[01:41:22.029 --> 01:41:26.732]  Yeah, do that and send it to Kevin at InfoWars, send it to Aaron at InfoWars, send it to Ryan at InfoWars.
[01:41:27.052 --> 01:41:29.833]  I'm out of time, I want to try to go to Tom.
[01:41:30.294 --> 01:41:32.695]  If I have time to go to you Tom, I will, but I want to give you the bad news.
[01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.535]  James Baker and Bush Sr.
[01:41:35.655 --> 01:41:39.116]  and Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, and if you don't know who they are, you better find out, folks.
[01:41:39.756 --> 01:41:41.977]  They were in control of Bush and the neocons the whole time.
[01:41:42.017 --> 01:41:43.197]  It's like birdcage liner.
[01:41:43.517 --> 01:41:45.358]  Bush is now going to take the blame for the agenda.
[01:41:45.738 --> 01:41:48.299]  Now they come in and their Iraq study group, what do they say?
[01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:53.721]  Oh, we want to build up the Iraqi internal army and then we'll pull out.
[01:41:53.821 --> 01:41:56.021]  That's the same story we've been getting for three and a half years.
[01:41:56.501 --> 01:41:58.082]  It's no difference.
[01:41:58.965 --> 01:42:00.866]  The Democratic leadership are saying they're going to stay.
[01:42:01.206 --> 01:42:02.787]  A few of them are saying they aren't.
[01:42:03.207 --> 01:42:09.129]  We need to press this and make sure the troops are pulled out because, listen, we could have won Vietnam in six weeks.
[01:42:09.489 --> 01:42:10.190]  I have the documents.
[01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:10.670]  It's public.
[01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:13.651]  It wasn't meant to be won.
[01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:16.552]  It was meant to go on to make money for defense contractors.
[01:42:16.932 --> 01:42:17.933]  Same thing in Iraq.
[01:42:18.213 --> 01:42:20.514]  They went in, kicked the bathers completely out,
[01:42:21.323 --> 01:42:33.896]  Then armed all the other sides to fight with each other, they destroyed the entire bureaucracy in a racially and religiously divided area, knowing their own documents said this was the goal.
[01:42:34.276 --> 01:42:35.017]  And they've done it.
[01:42:35.537 --> 01:42:38.020]  Bush has done an incredible job.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:51.490]  of what they set out to do, make money, get a permanent base there, make the world hate us, to generate more Islamic terror that's real, so they don't have to stage events, and that's Pentagon document P-2-O-G, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:53.211]  I mean folks, it's right out in the open.
[01:42:53.471 --> 01:42:54.332]  It is in the news.
[01:42:55.233 --> 01:43:02.458]  It's in the news, it just never becomes the big issue, because we're too busy talking about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Michael Jackson and
[01:43:04.183 --> 01:43:07.325]  And the idiot who, you know, has written a book about killing his wife now.
[01:43:07.805 --> 01:43:09.026]  I mean, so what?
[01:43:09.306 --> 01:43:11.987]  If you want freedom, you better get involved in real serious issues.
[01:43:12.548 --> 01:43:19.211]  The good news is, Senator Dodd, and we'll see if he does it, we'll be tracking this, is introducing legislation.
[01:43:19.391 --> 01:43:24.834]  Dodd introduces the Effective Terrorism Protection Act, brings terrorists to justice, honors America's good name.
[01:43:25.655 --> 01:43:30.017]  And this restores habeas corpus, doesn't allow them to arrest U.S.
[01:43:30.057 --> 01:43:35.140]  citizens without due process, doesn't allow torture to be admissible in court, bans torture.
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.381]  This gives us our soul back.
[01:43:38.021 --> 01:43:39.122]  I've got to read the bill itself.
[01:43:39.162 --> 01:43:41.143]  I've just read his press release in the subsections.
[01:43:42.063 --> 01:43:44.524]  But that is certainly some good news there.
[01:43:45.064 --> 01:43:50.367]  And Tom, you can take us out of the broadcast here as the final caller.
[01:43:50.507 --> 01:43:51.467]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:43:52.148 --> 01:43:52.468]  Welcome.
[01:43:53.248 --> 01:43:53.689]  Is this it?
[01:43:53.749 --> 01:43:54.369]  Are you going off?
[01:43:54.529 --> 01:43:55.170]  Yeah, we're going off, sir.
[01:43:55.210 --> 01:43:55.490]  Go ahead.
[01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:55.751]  Hit me.
[01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:56.051]  Hit me.
[01:43:56.411 --> 01:43:59.254]  What frequencies are you coming back on?
[01:43:59.614 --> 01:44:01.196]  Listen, I gotta let you go, sir.
[01:44:01.576 --> 01:44:04.559]  We're on AM and FM stations right now.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.341]  And I got loaded.
[01:44:06.441 --> 01:44:07.242]  I mean, I'll just take calls.
[01:44:07.282 --> 01:44:07.962]  Caller, what's your name?
[01:44:07.982 --> 01:44:08.543]  Where are you calling from?
[01:44:08.563 --> 01:44:10.304]  Hi, I'm calling from Australia.
[01:44:10.324 --> 01:44:10.845]  My name's Eric.
[01:44:11.045 --> 01:44:12.146]  Okay, calling from Australia.
[01:44:12.166 --> 01:44:12.827]  You got 30 seconds.
[01:44:13.391 --> 01:44:19.696]  Yeah, but the question is, is there room in the anti-New World Order movement and the Live and Truth movement if you're an atheist?
[01:44:19.716 --> 01:44:21.937]  Because I know that you guys... Yes, there is, sir.
[01:44:22.038 --> 01:44:26.961]  If you don't think that God designed this, that there's some advanced intelligence, that's your problem.
[01:44:27.902 --> 01:44:31.865]  There's room for everybody, every race, every creed, who wants freedom.
[01:44:33.901 --> 01:44:35.063]  Good answer, good answer.
[01:44:35.363 --> 01:44:36.404]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:44:36.424 --> 01:44:37.285]  I'm glad I took that one.
[01:44:37.505 --> 01:44:38.987]  The other one's probably from Tim Buck, too.
[01:44:39.307 --> 01:44:40.048]  I'm out of time.
[01:44:40.088 --> 01:44:40.728]  See you next week.
[01:44:40.748 --> 01:44:41.149]  God bless.
[01:44:41.569 --> 01:44:42.770]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:42.871 --> 01:44:47.696]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:47.796 --> 01:44:50.679]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:50.819 --> 01:44:54.783]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.123 --> 01:45:01.151]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, National Radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:01.331 --> 01:45:02.913]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:02.973 --> 01:45:05.317]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:12.825 --> 01:45:13.826]  Looking for profits?
[01:45:13.886 --> 01:45:15.267]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:15.627 --> 01:45:18.470]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:26.156]  This low-mintage electric coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:26.496 --> 01:45:29.999]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:30.259 --> 01:45:31.780]  Secure your position today.
[01:45:32.081 --> 01:45:33.202]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:33.342 --> 01:45:33.582]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
