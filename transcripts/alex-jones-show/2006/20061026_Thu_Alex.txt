[00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:06.201]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:07.942]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:09.762]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.223]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:17.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.826]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:41.562]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:47.166]  Thank you so much for joining us on this October 26, 2006 live edition.
[00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:58.433]  We're going to be here for the next three hours and we have several extremely important guests that are going to be joining us later during the show.
[00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:01.435]  We're going to, of course, have Robert David Steele,
[00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:07.387]  Formerly high-level Marine Corps Intelligence and CIA as well.
[00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.909]  And then that's in an hour.
[00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.292]  Then we have Webster Tarpley, who we always like to have join us at least once a month.
[00:01:15.153 --> 00:01:18.256]  He is an author, lecturer, researcher, and now radio talk show host.
[00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:23.300]  He's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.543]  In the first hour, I'm going to take your calls.
[00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:41.908]  The toll-free number to join us on any news issue, any item you wish to discuss, the huge war games going on in the Persian Gulf with two carrier task force groups and another task force group of warships and troop-carrying ships, amphibious assault cruisers.
[00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:50.274]  We also, of course, have Israel opening fire on a German patrol boat, and the Germans would not be making that up.
[00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:55.158]  They'd completely lick Israel's boots, basically give them free submarines, weapons, and aid
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.802]  Uh, I guess trying to make good from World War II.
[00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:03.507]  And it just, I mean, they're lucky they didn't get attacked like the USS Liberty for three hours.
[00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:05.750]  Uh, we've got that going on.
[00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.153]  We have discussion of a 9-11 truth political party.
[00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:15.400]  We have neo-con-academics continually calling the Constitution bad, saying it's a suicide pact.
[00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:17.803]  Existing home sales drop as
[00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:21.876]  Due prices and this is from U.S.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.277]  News and World Report, part of a larger move as real estate goes down.
[00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:32.538]  Another article here from World Net Daily, Achtung, Germany drags homeschooler kids to class.
[00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:37.279]  Authorities haul crying children away to avoid danger from parental teachings.
[00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.880]  That's the actual German government saying that.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.940]  We're going to cover it all today.
[00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:48.265]  But we will be taking your calls in the next segment, and the segment after that, right through the end of this hour.
[00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:53.470]  And then Mr. Steele will be joining us, talking about Inside Job on 9-11.
[00:02:55.772 --> 00:02:59.075]  Very important broadcast for you today.
[00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:01.117]  Again, that toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:01.638]  Also, ExxonMobil Post.
[00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.300]  10.49 billion profit in third quarter.
[00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.922]  Bush signs U.S.-Mexico border fence bill.
[00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:12.883]  Total smoke and mirrors.
[00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:15.104]  Again, that is all coming up after the break.
[00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:16.545]  A few program notes.
[00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:22.228]  Next Tuesday night here in Austin, Texas, they're at the corner of Lamar and 6th Street.
[00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:26.850]  I'll be at the Waterloo Records, that is Waterloo Music and Video.
[00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:31.413]  Very nice, sprawling music and video store.
[00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.831]  In the heart of Austin, a lot of parking there in their parking lot or in the surrounding area.
[00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:55.956]  I'll be there from 5 to 6.30 and I'll give a speech, take questions and sign TerrorStorm and this will be the official in-stores version, a little bit different than the one I sell at InfoWars.com and I certainly hope to see you out there and then coming up on what
[00:03:56.917 --> 00:04:04.241]  Coming up the Friday after that, where they're going to be showing Terror Storm for free at the Unitarian Church here in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:08.124]  So I'll tell you more about that a little bit later as well.
[00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.365]  Hope to see all the locals there.
[00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:13.367]  And of course, next Tuesday, nationwide!
[00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:16.869]  And I finally have a list of the stores it's going to be in.
[00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.353]  If I tried to even cover all of this, actually, it's so many stores I can't.
[00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.251]  I can't even read all of these where it's going to be.
[00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.452]  I mean it's hundreds of stores.
[00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.994]  Barnes and Nobles, Borders.
[00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:34.756]  I mean this is insane.
[00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:38.458]  Basically everywhere but Walmart and Best Buy and stuff like that.
[00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:47.323]  Basically 90 plus percent of the national stores and many local and regional stores are going to have Terror Storm.
[00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:53.187]  That's exciting because a lot of people that never would have been exposed to the truth will see these.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.103]  So please rush out next week and buy them off the shelves so more get put in.
[00:04:57.123 --> 00:04:58.284]  I want to make it a big hit.
[00:04:58.485 --> 00:04:58.985]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:04.871]  It's here.
[00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:09.836]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:17.824]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:25.581]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:37.408]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:41.231]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:43.632]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:47.795]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.388 --> 00:05:55.713]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.799]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.463]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:24.655]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:44.085]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:59.332]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.932 --> 00:07:04.533]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:07:04.773 --> 00:07:05.613]  Look no further!
[00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:08.514]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[00:07:55.878 --> 00:07:59.981]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:06.987]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.106 --> 00:08:25.652]  All right, I'm going to plunge into some of the news and guests that are coming up and hit a few top stories, and we're going to go to Paul Jeff, John Jesse Cecil, and many others that are holding wide open phones in this first hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:31.674]  During the last segment, I was briefly mentioning that my new film, Terror Storm, the history of government sponsored terror,
[00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:43.669]  We'll be in hundreds of stores, really thousands of stores, I guess hundreds of different branches of different companies across the country starting next Tuesday night.
[00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:57.394]  Barnes and Nobles, Movie Gallery, Borders, bookstores across the nation, all of the quote independent, it's a major chain of stores, Exclusive Co.,
[00:08:58.554 --> 00:09:00.035]  It just goes on and on.
[00:09:00.075 --> 00:09:02.397]  I mean, I really can't read all of these.
[00:09:02.838 --> 00:09:05.780]  Virgin Megastores nationwide here in the U.S.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.261]  and England.
[00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:11.664]  Waterloo Records here locally in Austin.
[00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:24.734]  And this list I have is only a partial list and there's hundreds of stores and hundreds of regional chains and chains here that are going to be having a place there.
[00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:27.977]  We have the same distributor as Outfoxed, which was
[00:09:29.022 --> 00:09:47.479]  Again, a huge film sent ripples and shockwaves across the globe showing how Fox News is a pack of disinformation artists and the different things that they engage in on a routine basis and it's really important.
[00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:52.723]  In fact, I'm going to put a press release out on this and a page up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:53.084 --> 00:09:54.265]  It's really important for
[00:09:55.446 --> 00:10:14.855]  This could be a big hit in the stores because if day one, when the average store buys five copies of this, if day one you go into your local bookstore, your local Barnes and Nobles, your local Borders, your local Waterloo, your local Virgin, Megastore, Atlantic, you go in and buy these off the shelves, then they'll order even more.
[00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:17.697]  And if those sell out, then they'll all put end caps in.
[00:10:18.357 --> 00:10:24.240]  I'm told at Barnes and Nobles and that Borders are going to have end caps.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.181]  Now, this was paid for by my distributor.
[00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:33.041]  And the way they pay for it is, they basically give them the videos.
[00:10:33.782 --> 00:10:41.083]  A lot of times when you see stuff that's on an end cap, or that's a huge display, that's done as a rollout, basically.
[00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:45.464]  And so my distributor is taking a big risk.
[00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:52.945]  They're putting a lot of money into hundreds of Barnes & Nobles, basically getting free videos.
[00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:56.184]  I have to get them for like $2 a piece or something it cost.
[00:10:58.105 --> 00:11:01.167]  Again, we need to get this out to the people.
[00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:04.409]  Just like I put TerrorStorm out for free on Google Video.
[00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:06.350]  With the one desire.
[00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:17.604]  To have tens of millions of people see it, and counting up all the visitors and hits we've gotten with the times Google's deleted our page views, it's over 6 million people on Google Video alone have seen Terraform.
[00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:24.230]  That sounds great, and I'm glad, and the films are worth my while, you know, to put out for free, just to reach those 6 million people.
[00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.291]  That's not enough, folks.
[00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.014]  Most of those 6 million were already converted.
[00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:32.178]  We need to, the 6 million that have seen it, need to tell another 6 million about it.
[00:11:32.856 --> 00:11:38.618]  And you've done that and I've seen you out there on the message boards and the blogs and the MySpace accounts telling everybody to watch TerrorStorm.
[00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:49.383]  Go to InfoWars.com to get the main link to the TerrorStorm you need to promote because there's a whole bunch of versions of it up there on Google Video and then all of our hits get spread out so we don't stay in the top 100.
[00:11:50.672 --> 00:11:55.874]  Where we can reach millions of other people a day who go to the Top 100 to make their viewing choices.
[00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:58.955]  It's like getting on national TV basically to be in the Top 100.
[00:11:59.035 --> 00:12:02.597]  It's like being on a major news channel to be in the Top 20 or 30.
[00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:10.340]  Which we've only been in the Top 30 one time and hundreds of thousands of people were watching and then it dropped out and it's just tens of thousands a day.
[00:12:11.244 --> 00:12:14.905]  And it's sad, because we need to have millions of people see TerrorStorm.
[00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:24.968]  I mean, it's exciting we've already reached six million, and we don't have a way of tracking what's happened on the other web sharing networks and the torrents and all the other ways to watch it.
[00:12:25.008 --> 00:12:27.968]  I would imagine it's quite large as well, but we don't know.
[00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:35.570]  We know six-plus million have seen it, and again, I want to commend all of you that have helped us promote this and get this out to people.
[00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:37.411]  That's the goal of all of this.
[00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:43.780]  And I've been beating my brains out going on every radio show I can to tell people to go watch it for free.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.242]  And then the hosts go, don't you want to plug?
[00:12:45.262 --> 00:12:45.822]  You sell it!
[00:12:46.623 --> 00:12:51.767]  I was on with Jack Stockwell, great guy out of Salt Lake City today.
[00:12:52.068 --> 00:12:54.269]  I meant to tell that station to pick up my Sunday show.
[00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.551]  They've never picked up my weekday show.
[00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:57.132]  I don't know why.
[00:12:58.053 --> 00:12:59.974]  They've picked up stuff like Rents and other good shows.
[00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:02.997]  They need to pick up at least the Sunday show.
[00:13:03.037 --> 00:13:07.281]  I'm asking affiliates out there that are currently picking up this show to please pick up the new Sunday show.
[00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:08.362]  I'm doing it from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:13:08.722 --> 00:13:10.144]  Syndicated through MS Communications.
[00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:11.485]  It's up on the Star Guide feed.
[00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.967]  Details are all at GCNlive.com.
[00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:19.372]  But again, I'm already digressing here.
[00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:24.177]  Oh, by the way, before I go to your calls in the news, we are carrying
[00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:29.855]  We were carrying it day one on Monday when it was released, the DVD, and it's even better than what you saw in theaters.
[00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:38.903]  It's been expanded to include the North American Union, not just Federal Reserve and IRS, and the microchipping tracking grid, the RFID, America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:13:39.804 --> 00:13:47.190]  I'm glad to see people are going completely crazy on Infowars.com ordering it, and I hope you'll go there if you haven't and order it.
[00:13:48.111 --> 00:13:50.493]  At least support Aaron Russo and us, and you get a powerful film.
[00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:52.235]  Aaron says, go ahead and make copies.
[00:13:52.893 --> 00:13:55.434]  He spent over a million dollars making and promoting them.
[00:13:55.454 --> 00:14:02.216]  He bought ads on national TV, ads on radio, and the guy has basically not even made 10% of his money back.
[00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:04.077]  And he just says he doesn't care anymore.
[00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:06.378]  That was his words.
[00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:08.759]  At first, he was like, well, I don't need to make my money back.
[00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:09.659]  He just said, forget it.
[00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:11.080]  Just make copies.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.822]  But for heaven's sakes, at least buy the DVD from InfoWars.com.
[00:14:18.002 --> 00:14:20.343]  So at least he makes something back because he wants to make another film.
[00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:22.663]  I feel like such a fool.
[00:14:22.783 --> 00:14:28.726]  I get so busy that I was making Terror Storm when Aaron Russo called me seven, eight months ago and said, I want to put you in my new film.
[00:14:29.567 --> 00:14:30.988]  My wife kept saying, call Aaron Russo.
[00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:32.108]  Call Aaron Russo.
[00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:34.029]  I didn't even call him back.
[00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:44.396]  I got a call to go out to Hollywood a month ago to cast for a medium-sized role.
[00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:50.019]  Instead of being two minutes in a film or one minute in a film, a major film, I would have been a major part.
[00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:51.494]  You know what I did?
[00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:53.315]  I just said, forget it.
[00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:58.278]  And again, I'm not bragging and tooting my horn here, but I just want you to know my commitment.
[00:14:59.118 --> 00:15:02.940]  Do you know people that get offered major roles?
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.501]  And this isn't somebody shooting their mouth off.
[00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:06.102]  I mean, I've been in two major films.
[00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:09.123]  One was Fox Searchlight, the other Warner Brothers.
[00:15:10.404 --> 00:15:11.745]  Waking Life of Scanner Darkly.
[00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:14.926]  And that was because those were films I could go shoot one day on.
[00:15:15.627 --> 00:15:18.188]  I consulted on Scanner Darkly maybe for a week.
[00:15:20.123 --> 00:15:25.027]  I counted the cost and got offered, well basically it was speculative.
[00:15:25.047 --> 00:15:30.552]  I had to go out there and deal with it and it wasn't a role that would fight the New World Order.
[00:15:31.313 --> 00:15:36.257]  It wasn't a role that would do anything, that would affect change.
[00:15:36.297 --> 00:15:41.481]  I mean, it's scantardarkly I get to expose that the government deals the drugs and creates the drugs.
[00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:46.726]  In Waking Life, I got to talk about fighting the New World Order and the dynamic human spirit refusing to submit.
[00:15:48.693 --> 00:15:53.996]  My good friend here in Austin, Richard Linklater, and if he ever invites me to be in another film, I'll do it, because all his films have a good message.
[00:15:55.516 --> 00:15:59.118]  I will, or at least most of them, I guess School of Rock really does in there.
[00:15:59.478 --> 00:16:01.899]  The Fast Food Nation coming out does with Bruce Willis and others.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.761]  But, I mean, I just said, you know what?
[00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:05.321]  No thanks.
[00:16:07.582 --> 00:16:11.984]  And so, I mean, I have a chance to go be in movies, okay?
[00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:14.205]  Something that people
[00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:19.289]  Well, I mean, I've been told by Hollywood because I have violence in my eyes.
[00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:31.562]  And I was told that... I was told that many years ago by a local director here in town who makes art films, a pretty well-known, I won't say his name.
[00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:35.686]  He said, you've got what they call violence in your eyes.
[00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:37.808]  And they said it's not necessarily means you're a bad guy or a good guy.
[00:16:37.848 --> 00:16:38.489]  They said it's like
[00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:40.697]  He mentioned a few other famous actors.
[00:16:40.717 --> 00:16:42.438]  He said, uh, it's very convincing.
[00:16:42.498 --> 00:16:43.118]  It's compelling.
[00:16:43.479 --> 00:16:44.419]  You ought to be in pictures.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.580]  I'm just like, yeah, I ought to be in pictures.
[00:16:47.021 --> 00:16:48.081]  You know, the old, the old thing.
[00:16:48.422 --> 00:16:56.246]  Well, how many of you, you know, it's harder to turn down being in a big movie and I mean having a major part in it, but it would take months.
[00:16:56.887 --> 00:16:58.227]  I'd have to quit this radio show.
[00:16:58.888 --> 00:17:04.251]  It's harder to turn that down than it is to turn down millions of dollars, which I've been offered to sell out to the new world order.
[00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:10.973]  And so I just want you to know the type of commitment that I have made.
[00:17:10.993 --> 00:17:13.054]  And I don't have sour grapes over it.
[00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:13.974]  I'm even more committed.
[00:17:14.015 --> 00:17:18.256]  But then I just look at my daily life and there's a lot of toil.
[00:17:19.676 --> 00:17:24.958]  And it's not a thankless job because we're out there working in the mines of men and women.
[00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:26.939]  We're not going to have a country.
[00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:27.759]  They've signed H.R.
[00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:27.759]  6166.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.280]  We're going into World War III.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.021]  We're going into a police state.
[00:17:32.741 --> 00:17:35.362]  And I'm not going to just punch out and drift off.
[00:17:36.317 --> 00:17:37.258]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:17:53.391 --> 00:17:55.092]  I don't want to hear from bankers out there.
[00:17:55.112 --> 00:17:56.572]  I don't want to hear from real estate agents.
[00:17:56.592 --> 00:18:05.694]  I don't want to hear from, you know, doctors and lawyers and other talk show hosts that, oh, well, I'm going to be part of the system because I want the power and I want to have the money and I want to have the status.
[00:18:06.035 --> 00:18:09.776]  Hey, none of that matters, folks, when you've got a government that kidnaps kids for sex slaverings.
[00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.376]  And it's in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.917]  None of that counts when they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[00:18:15.457 --> 00:18:18.378]  None of that counts when our country is going into a North American Union.
[00:18:18.978 --> 00:18:21.939]  None of that counts when they're grabbing homeschoolers from their parents.
[00:18:22.617 --> 00:18:23.697]  It just, it doesn't count.
[00:18:24.678 --> 00:18:32.699]  So I don't want to hear that, oh, you know, you're just, you're going to be self-centered and focus on me, me, me, you know, I, I, I, and that you're going to get ahead.
[00:18:32.759 --> 00:18:33.940]  You are not going to get ahead.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.700]  You're not going to have a country to live in.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.441]  We're already a third world country, folks, in many respects.
[00:18:38.481 --> 00:18:44.782]  Our test scores, every trend, every indices in the indications we've got is bad.
[00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:47.163]  It's bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[00:18:53.214 --> 00:18:56.295]  I just, it makes my brain burn.
[00:18:57.956 --> 00:19:05.160]  Believe me folks, I'd rather be fishing, I'd rather be marching around camping in the woods, I'd rather be playing football and soccer with my children.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:13.863]  I literally would rather work 40 hours a week and get into my shelf and get into reading books and do all that, but I just can't folks, there's a war.
[00:19:14.524 --> 00:19:15.424]  We're under attack here.
[00:19:15.544 --> 00:19:16.485]  America's going down.
[00:19:17.985 --> 00:19:21.387]  And I just hope you realize what the stakes are.
[00:19:22.907 --> 00:19:25.749]  I mean, I'm so frustrated I can't make films quick enough or good enough.
[00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:30.371]  I'm so frustrated that I don't... There's so much... I need to work even harder, but I can't.
[00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:31.451]  I can't.
[00:19:32.332 --> 00:19:49.581]  And I just try everything I can to wake people up, and I know we've had a great effect, but it's not happening fast enough, and I, uh... Well... We'll, uh... We'll, uh... Come back, go write your calls.
[00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:55.596]  Then I'll get into all the news, what's happening with Israel, what's happening with the war, what's happening with the economy, the election.
[00:19:55.616 --> 00:19:57.197]  We've got two big guests coming up today.
[00:19:57.217 --> 00:20:02.382]  Stay with us.
[00:20:05.084 --> 00:20:07.025]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.948]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:10.728 --> 00:20:19.115]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:20.103 --> 00:20:24.986]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:35.632]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:36.113 --> 00:20:38.434]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:39.214 --> 00:20:40.455]  For more information call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:40.475 --> 00:20:40.515]  702-953-0267.
[00:20:49.193 --> 00:20:52.854]  Or visit www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:20:53.194 --> 00:20:59.216]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:02.797]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:21:02.837 --> 00:21:03.597]  Today is October 26, 2006.
[00:21:03.657 --> 00:21:07.038]  Gold opened at $594.70, and 1-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $626.96.
[00:21:07.098 --> 00:21:08.718]  Again, that's $626.96 for just 1-ounce gold coins.
[00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:18.115]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[00:21:18.575 --> 00:21:23.198]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[00:21:23.598 --> 00:21:25.019]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.622]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[00:21:28.982 --> 00:21:34.446]  We the people labor to create the money only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[00:21:34.846 --> 00:21:36.407]  They in turn lend it back to us
[00:21:36.807 --> 00:21:40.530]  And we the people are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:45.813]  Midas Resources is offering the creature from Jekyll Island a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:21:46.234 --> 00:21:46.514]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.534 --> 00:21:48.135]  If you haven't read this book, get a copy today.
[00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:48.195]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:50.356]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:50.757]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.962 --> 00:22:05.344]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:10.328]  Did you know that Russia sponsored a terrorist training camp in Havana, Cuba in 1966?
[00:22:10.488 --> 00:22:16.572]  In this camp, they planned terrorist activity on every continent, including the United States.
[00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:21.116]  Have we seen terrorist activities on every continent just as they planned?
[00:22:21.636 --> 00:22:30.903]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:33.309]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:33.329 --> 00:22:36.770]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.310]  It's free.
[00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.631]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[00:23:02.165 --> 00:23:07.267]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:23:07.327 --> 00:23:14.630]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:25.414]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:30.156]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:23:30.436 --> 00:23:35.419]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:23:35.639 --> 00:23:38.580]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:48.665]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:23:48.705 --> 00:23:53.548]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:23:53.648 --> 00:23:55.229]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at
[00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:07.556]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[00:24:07.576 --> 00:24:11.178]  Then I'll get into ExxonMobil post $10.49 million profit in the third quarter.
[00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:15.501]  Bush signs his staged fence bill right before the election as a stunt.
[00:24:17.002 --> 00:24:17.763]  It's never to be built.
[00:24:17.883 --> 00:24:18.443]  Total fraud.
[00:24:18.463 --> 00:24:19.784]  All the analysts are saying that.
[00:24:20.464 --> 00:24:27.169]  Israel basically shoots, strafes a German patrol boat and it's all been whitewashed.
[00:24:28.693 --> 00:24:30.394]  There's a lot coming up, but let's go to your calls.
[00:24:30.514 --> 00:24:32.374]  Paul in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:24:32.414 --> 00:24:32.774]  Welcome.
[00:24:33.174 --> 00:24:34.054]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:35.155]  Hello.
[00:24:35.375 --> 00:24:38.696]  God love you, and I'm a new listener and a first-time caller.
[00:24:38.916 --> 00:24:39.936]  Well, good to have you on board.
[00:24:39.956 --> 00:24:42.857]  I got a couple of questions for you, Alex, that's all.
[00:24:44.157 --> 00:24:47.138]  I have two friends of mine that are members of the John Birch Society.
[00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:49.796]  And you sound very much like them.
[00:24:49.836 --> 00:24:52.138]  Where do you stand regarding the John Birch Society?
[00:24:52.278 --> 00:24:58.602]  Well, I sound like them because I'm reading the same government documents and CFR documents that they've been covering for 40 years.
[00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:01.444]  And I think the JBS has done a lot of great work.
[00:25:02.148 --> 00:25:03.688]  And they were against the Vietnam War.
[00:25:03.728 --> 00:25:04.749]  They're true conservatives.
[00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:06.589]  They've been demonized.
[00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:09.489]  They pulled their horns in the last decade.
[00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.730]  But McManus says that's because they've probably been infiltrated.
[00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.850]  They've now got better leadership in there.
[00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.011]  And they're now looking at 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:25:18.071 --> 00:25:19.491]  OKC being an inside job.
[00:25:19.531 --> 00:25:21.392]  And I think we've all got to work together.
[00:25:22.372 --> 00:25:22.972]  Yeah, OK.
[00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:25.753]  Alex, who would you prefer to be in the White House?
[00:25:26.273 --> 00:25:27.613]  Hillary Clinton or George Bush?
[00:25:28.537 --> 00:25:32.320]  Hillary Clinton, because then that would wake conservatives up and they wouldn't go to sleep.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:41.427]  I'd rather have the wolf fully with his long, black, red fur out rending the sheep instead of a, you know, oh look at that big sheep that's over there eating sheep, but it's a sheep!
[00:25:41.447 --> 00:25:51.955]  You know, I'd rather people know the enemy that we're facing and know what we're dealing with than have someone who at least has an R before their name neutralizing the people of this country.
[00:25:53.536 --> 00:25:54.216]  Okay, interesting.
[00:25:55.606 --> 00:25:59.188]  I mean, listen, George Bush has done more than Clinton and Hillary could ever do.
[00:25:59.208 --> 00:26:06.551]  North American Union, open borders, crippling the size of the BATF, abolishing the Bill of Rights, and Hillary voted for all of that.
[00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:07.712]  She voted for HR 6166.
[00:26:08.712 --> 00:26:10.153]  They're all the same, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:10.413 --> 00:26:13.334]  I'd rather get people focused on county, city, and state elections.
[00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:16.816]  Are you familiar with the Omni Publications?
[00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.337]  Omni Book Club?
[00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:22.599]  I remember Omni when it was a science fiction magazine.
[00:26:23.934 --> 00:26:25.415]  I don't know about what you're talking about.
[00:26:25.435 --> 00:26:29.698]  Okay, and can you tell me, what is a neocon?
[00:26:30.438 --> 00:26:31.499]  I hear that so often.
[00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:34.541]  Well, a neocon's called themselves neocons.
[00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:41.065]  They were mainly the Trotskyites, Fourth International, that claimed they were then conservatives, and took over the Republican Party.
[00:26:41.745 --> 00:26:52.272]  There were also a lot of more adherents of the Chicago Business School there, and Leo Strauss, who was an avowed fascist and believed in command and control of government.
[00:26:52.999 --> 00:26:58.185]  And they also, many of them are, a large portion of them are double agents publicly of Israel.
[00:26:58.205 --> 00:27:01.948]  Many of them have worked in the cabinet of the government of Israel and are Mossad agents.
[00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:08.916]  But a lot of them are also WASPs like Dick Cheney and George Bush and Jeb Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:27:09.116 --> 00:27:13.701]  And it's a weird collection of criminals,
[00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:16.822]  What do we call ourselves?
[00:27:16.842 --> 00:27:19.803]  Well, that's what I think of myself as a constitutionalist.
[00:27:44.522 --> 00:27:47.604]  Well, that's how I think of myself, too, but the average person doesn't know what that is.
[00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:56.169]  How come you continue to refer to neo-Nazi and fascism when it seems to me that this is a global thing and more akin to communism?
[00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:10.338]  Well, sir, you have to understand, and I'm sure you know this, that the big banks financed communism during the Russian Revolution from 1914 to 1918, and that they financed them all the way through.
[00:28:10.358 --> 00:28:10.958]  That's admitted.
[00:28:11.038 --> 00:28:12.379]  Now the government admits what we knew.
[00:28:13.126 --> 00:28:17.093]  What the JBS said 40 years ago, that our government put Mao in.
[00:28:17.133 --> 00:28:19.637]  They now brag about it on national television, on History Channel.
[00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:20.899]  It's now declassified.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.603]  And that they build up this.
[00:28:23.663 --> 00:28:27.650]  So communism is only one front of these people.
[00:28:28.587 --> 00:28:30.469]  Just like they own the Democrats and the Republicans.
[00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:33.211]  The Republicans are the fascists, the Democrats are the communists.
[00:28:33.591 --> 00:28:34.872]  Either way, you get the same system.
[00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:35.673]  Yeah, right.
[00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:37.375]  It's the right and left hand of the same beast.
[00:28:37.655 --> 00:28:38.175]  Exactly.
[00:28:38.456 --> 00:28:39.496]  That's why they're in control.
[00:28:40.437 --> 00:28:42.659]  It's like a mobster who owns both fighters.
[00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:44.721]  Or a mobster who owns the top three horses.
[00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:45.642]  Yeah, right.
[00:28:46.042 --> 00:28:47.383]  Okay, do you have an email address?
[00:28:48.224 --> 00:28:48.604]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:48.704 --> 00:28:48.844]  It's...
[00:28:50.379 --> 00:28:58.164]  Well, the best place is just to send it to tipsandinfowars.com, aaronandinfowars.com, kevinandinfowars.com.
[00:28:58.444 --> 00:28:58.825]  Oh, okay.
[00:28:58.845 --> 00:28:59.985]  I've already got that one.
[00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:01.647]  Okay, good enough.
[00:29:01.667 --> 00:29:02.227]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:03.088]  Thank you.
[00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:05.369]  Yeah, I go and scan through all of it, and they scan through it.
[00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:06.630]  No one person can do it all.
[00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:11.793]  We all kind of like some giant, you know, 500-ounce T-bone every day.
[00:29:11.853 --> 00:29:16.657]  We all try to descend on like a pack of weasels trying to eat it all.
[00:29:16.677 --> 00:29:19.198]  I mean, there's no way to ever be able to
[00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:22.308]  We don't eat the entire thing, but we attempt.
[00:29:22.908 --> 00:29:26.349]  So don't stop sending us email, because we miss a lot of it, but we see most of it.
[00:29:26.689 --> 00:29:34.132]  We wallow in giant bags of letters every week, and wallow in faxes, and wallow in people in distress, begging us for help.
[00:29:34.792 --> 00:29:44.595]  I describe it as, our ship is sunk, we're in a lifeboat, the lifeboat's about to sink, it's so overloaded, there's nothing but hands reaching out of the frosty, frozen ocean.
[00:29:51.577 --> 00:29:54.638]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.678 --> 00:29:58.279]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:09.983]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.203 --> 00:30:12.024]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.224 --> 00:30:13.364]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.732 --> 00:30:19.840]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:06.555]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:08.837]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:31:09.077 --> 00:31:16.183]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:31:16.323 --> 00:31:17.044]  We're good to go!
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:31.840]  We're good to go!
[00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:08.261]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:13.422]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:32:13.822 --> 00:32:16.443]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:32:16.943 --> 00:32:20.344]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:25.446]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:32:25.866 --> 00:32:29.067]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:32.508]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:32:33.286 --> 00:32:35.427]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:32:35.467 --> 00:32:37.528]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:32:37.548 --> 00:32:37.588]  U.S.
[00:32:37.928 --> 00:32:39.669]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:32:39.689 --> 00:32:39.969]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:40.869]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:41.410]  Ask for George.
[00:33:14.395 --> 00:33:15.636]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:15.696 --> 00:33:19.298]  So glad that you joined us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:33:19.318 --> 00:33:21.519]  We're going to go back to your calls in a moment and into the news.
[00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:24.721]  Do you know who's joining us in the next hour?
[00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:28.783]  Robert Steele will be coming on the broadcast with us.
[00:33:30.604 --> 00:33:33.125]  And he's an amazing, amazing individual.
[00:33:33.826 --> 00:33:35.407]  I have his bio here.
[00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:41.370]  Robert David Steele is a former Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer at the highest level.
[00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:42.825]  We're good to go!
[00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:04.635]  Inc.
[00:34:04.735 --> 00:34:06.536]  as well as the Golden Camel Society.
[00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:12.118]  Steele also was a member of the adjunct faculty of the Marine Corps University in the mid-1990s.
[00:34:12.878 --> 00:34:14.499]  And he has been a conservative.
[00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:15.299]  He is a conservative.
[00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.240]  He's going to be joining us coming up.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.641]  Talking about 9-11.
[00:34:21.622 --> 00:34:23.802]  Now going public on 9-11.
[00:34:23.842 --> 00:34:24.643]  Mr. Steele.
[00:34:26.423 --> 00:34:30.305]  Of course, Bill Christensen is the highest ranking former CIA official.
[00:34:30.945 --> 00:34:33.046]  Ran their entire foreign threat division.
[00:34:34.713 --> 00:34:48.103]  In DC and overseas, I mean he was over an entire department and he said for years he ignored people who said it was an inside job, then he decided to look at the evidence and he said all of the evidence points towards inside job, total inside job.
[00:34:48.383 --> 00:34:56.108]  Here on air he said they certainly knew and let it happen but he said the problem is the evidence doesn't point towards that as much as it points towards total inside job.
[00:34:56.549 --> 00:34:58.330]  You see, number one, the official story is a lie.
[00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:01.366]  It's impossible.
[00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:01.926]  It's a fraud.
[00:35:02.307 --> 00:35:04.307]  And then if you want to say, well, they let it happen.
[00:35:04.327 --> 00:35:11.189]  Yeah, there's all the evidence of that, but you look into more evidence, it all points towards, it has to be involvement, total involvement.
[00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:12.110]  And it's so sad.
[00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.551]  It's so sad that we stand here on the precipice.
[00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:21.612]  By the way, if you want to find out the truth about 9-11, many of you already know it, but it's going to have a powerful tool to wake people up.
[00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:25.034]  Terror Storm is out and it hits stores nationwide.
[00:35:25.694 --> 00:35:29.555]  Almost every major video slash bookstore in the country, Barnes & Noble, Borders,
[00:35:31.164 --> 00:35:35.927]  Virgin, Atlantic, they're all going to have it starting November 1st.
[00:35:36.007 --> 00:35:38.228]  It'll be in all the stores, but it'll be in most stores.
[00:35:38.368 --> 00:35:39.909]  The main launch is October 31st.
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.570]  That's next Tuesday.
[00:35:42.351 --> 00:35:47.134]  Please call and get TerrorStorm 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:47.514 --> 00:35:51.536]  We also have America, Freedom from Fascism right now at InfoWars.com on DVD.
[00:35:51.957 --> 00:35:53.277]  Alright, I'm done talking about that.
[00:35:56.439 --> 00:35:58.901]  Let's just go to your calls and then we'll
[00:36:00.953 --> 00:36:02.954]  Then we'll continue with the news here.
[00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:05.394]  Let's talk to Jeff in Kentucky.
[00:36:05.434 --> 00:36:05.954]  Jeff, welcome.
[00:36:06.454 --> 00:36:07.355]  Hey brother, how's it going?
[00:36:07.875 --> 00:36:10.395]  Well, we're on the precipice.
[00:36:10.436 --> 00:36:10.836]  We're here.
[00:36:10.896 --> 00:36:13.836]  Everything we talked about all these years is now happening right now.
[00:36:13.996 --> 00:36:14.297]  I know.
[00:36:14.357 --> 00:36:19.938]  I'm sitting here watching it live on the news and I want to bring something to your attention.
[00:36:19.978 --> 00:36:21.939]  I just found out while I was researching something.
[00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:26.860]  I'm a student up here at WKU, Western Kentucky University over in Bowling Green.
[00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:34.895]  I'm giving, or I'm taking a class on public speaking, and I'm using the forum as the proper gate.
[00:36:35.315 --> 00:36:39.836]  Well, you found out, and all the other 9-11 truthers out there found out.
[00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:48.058]  In my first speech, I made a packet with a copy of Terror Storm and a copy of 9-11 Release Change for everyone in my class.
[00:36:48.098 --> 00:36:48.438]  Good!
[00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:57.940]  And my teacher, this was right after when House Bill 6166 came out, and I've got two National Guard guys in my class, I'm like,
[00:36:58.666 --> 00:37:08.334]  Like, I know there's two guys here still connected to the government, and I'm like, you can, if you get caught with this, be prosecuted as a treasonous act, and a terrorist.
[00:37:08.674 --> 00:37:10.255]  And so, this is America.
[00:37:10.556 --> 00:37:13.878]  Now, we get these calls every day, on air, every day at the office.
[00:37:14.199 --> 00:37:16.500]  It's been in the news, what you're saying really happens.
[00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:20.403]  So they think America is the Soviet slash Nazi Union.
[00:37:20.804 --> 00:37:24.667]  Who said to you that you could be prosecuted?
[00:37:25.154 --> 00:37:32.380]  Well it says right there in the H1, HR, no I gave this speech, when I went to give this speech I put the little warning out before I even told anybody to open their packets.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.683]  I was like, listen, like I know I've got two National Guard guys in my class.
[00:37:35.703 --> 00:37:39.185]  Oh, you were saying it for effect, but there is a root of truth to it, yeah, okay.
[00:37:39.225 --> 00:37:51.936]  Yes, and I, and to give clarity or credibility to my speech, I went through my history, I'm an eight year combat veteran, two times a Kosovo and got wounded in Iraq, and that's the reason I ended up in college.
[00:37:52.423 --> 00:38:03.748]  My philosophy teacher pointed me indirectly to you and when I was giving a speech I had a kid in my class pick up the packet and throw it at my feet and basically call me a terrorist and walk out of class.
[00:38:03.788 --> 00:38:15.574]  He was a neocon and he confronted me after class and basically looked like he wanted to divulge, or not divulge, but confront me in a physical manner until he saw my license plate which had a purple heart on it and then he turned around and walked off.
[00:38:16.713 --> 00:38:21.497]  Because they're in this cult that you worship the troops, but it's only surface.
[00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:22.838]  You don't really help the troops.
[00:38:23.158 --> 00:38:26.100]  You don't really support the troops.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.522]  They try to associate themselves with it.
[00:38:28.782 --> 00:38:31.444]  So he's like a robot that's given info it can't compute.
[00:38:31.464 --> 00:38:33.446]  He's like, cannot compute, cannot compute.
[00:38:33.746 --> 00:38:35.087]  Smoke starts coming out of his ears.
[00:38:35.688 --> 00:38:36.989]  And he wasn't even a National Guard guy.
[00:38:37.009 --> 00:38:41.312]  He was just some random dude that was in my class.
[00:38:41.412 --> 00:38:43.174]  Some random punk who's never lived.
[00:38:44.648 --> 00:38:51.370]  And I watched Aaron Rousseau's movie on the pay-per-view for his website, freedomoffascism.com.
[00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:57.153]  And I was so dumbstruck by it, I paid for it again, which is $5 a pop.
[00:38:57.333 --> 00:39:00.794]  I paid for it again, I watched it again, and my next speech is going to be over that movie.
[00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:06.416]  And while I was researching it, I ran into this Western Kentucky University Promotes Internet 2.
[00:39:08.116 --> 00:39:08.817]  As a sideline.
[00:39:09.137 --> 00:39:12.118]  I'm sitting there looking at it, I've got the website in front of me, and it says,
[00:39:12.867 --> 00:39:19.772]  That Internet2 is a 10-year-old organization from about 200 universities, 7 corporations, and 50 affiliates.
[00:39:19.852 --> 00:39:21.993]  And it's been running for 10 years.
[00:39:23.234 --> 00:39:24.054]  Inside of America.
[00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:27.096]  And it says that the DSL has nothing to compare to it.
[00:39:27.136 --> 00:39:29.118]  It's almost like a seamless experience.
[00:39:29.138 --> 00:39:29.938]  Yeah, no, no.
[00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:38.244]  Sir, if you go to the corporate minutes and if you go to the speeches that are all transcribed online of Internet2 in Austin last year,
[00:39:39.105 --> 00:39:46.009]  Of Internet 2 before that in London, of Internet 2 before that I believe it was in Chicago, before that it was in Berlin, and one was in Japan.
[00:39:46.669 --> 00:39:51.152]  If you go read, and every time they give a speech, they say the Internet is dead.
[00:39:51.492 --> 00:39:58.256]  So if you type the Internet is dead in, you'll get the register and AP and all the articles, and it's always the same talking points.
[00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:03.619]  They're going to shut down the old web incrementally in the next three years.
[00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:05.936]  They're going to force you onto Internet 2.
[00:40:06.076 --> 00:40:15.002]  China turned Internet 2 on two weeks ago, and they're now blocking everybody from getting into information, and they force you on the government systems that track you.
[00:40:15.863 --> 00:40:22.707]  You hear Chertoff saying terrorists are training on the web, anti-government, we've got to restrict it, we've got to have you enter your ID or thumb scan when you start your computer.
[00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:25.249]  All that's coming out standard on the keyboards.
[00:40:25.989 --> 00:40:28.331]  So yes, they are killing the web right now.
[00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:29.071]  It's like a boa.
[00:40:29.131 --> 00:40:30.132]  Just grab the web.
[00:40:30.512 --> 00:40:31.893]  It's just now wrapping around us.
[00:40:31.973 --> 00:40:33.034]  It's just now squeezing us.
[00:40:33.692 --> 00:40:48.545]  And we can kick and bite and jump out right now if we try, but if the Dumbbell America doesn't, and it's going to be advertised as, oh there's a new web, it works a lot better, oh look, look at the outages of the old internet, oh they didn't upgrade the hubs, they didn't upgrade them, and oh look,
[00:40:49.285 --> 00:40:53.487]  There's all that identity theft on it, and oh look, they're having net neutrality fights.
[00:40:53.547 --> 00:40:58.250]  Cogent and Level 3 aren't sharing data between each other, so the backbones aren't working together.
[00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:09.035]  Well, since your normal web hasn't been working, just come over here and sign a form with one of these universities or 50 affiliates that are corporate, or the seven major backbones, and you just listed it correctly.
[00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:15.258]  And once you sign on here, you have a sub-domain, kind of like MySpace, and they can delete you whenever they want.
[00:41:15.318 --> 00:41:17.879]  They'll restrict what videos you can post or what you can do.
[00:41:17.899 --> 00:41:21.240]  And they've openly announced it because we're cleaning their clocks.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:28.503]  You think they're going to let people continue to let PrisonPlanet.com be as rated as big as the Dallas Morning News?
[00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:30.224]  You think they're going to continue to let
[00:41:31.252 --> 00:41:37.017]  I mean, the Washington Times is at 7,800 and something, and Prison Planet's thousands of places bigger than that.
[00:41:37.337 --> 00:41:46.565]  You think they like the fact that PrisonPlanet.com doesn't make any money, but it sure as... I want to use the word hell, but I want to try to be family-oriented here.
[00:41:46.946 --> 00:41:50.649]  I mean, it's just, you know, they can... and I'm just one of thousands of sites now.
[00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:52.130]  Okay?
[00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:55.553]  I mean, it's very exciting to me that... take 911blogger.com.
[00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:06.804]  Uh, those guys, you know, some days were rated, you know, 9, 10,000 on the web, uh, whereas something like, uh, you know, the Village Voice isn't rated that big.
[00:42:07.144 --> 00:42:13.273]  I mean, it's overnight people are coming out and grabbing millions of viewers and readers.
[00:42:13.917 --> 00:42:15.318]  Hey brother, I've got another question for you.
[00:42:44.178 --> 00:42:44.718]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:42:44.878 --> 00:42:49.660]  Where are you getting your information on this Falcon Base interacting?
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.702]  Because I've got brothers still in the Army right now.
[00:42:52.762 --> 00:42:53.662]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:55.583]  I meant to get that guy on the show today.
[00:42:55.963 --> 00:42:58.404]  Paul Watson, I know, interviewed him yesterday and I haven't talked to him.
[00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:01.705]  You ask where I'm getting my information.
[00:43:01.725 --> 00:43:07.608]  Yeah, because I haven't found anything on it and I've got brothers that are in the 4th ID right now and I haven't heard from them in a while.
[00:43:07.948 --> 00:43:10.429]  I haven't reported on it because I don't know what the truth is.
[00:43:11.169 --> 00:43:12.630]  The media and the government
[00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:18.719]  It says that it was a bunch of plastic explosives and munitions blew up and a bunch of people got injured, no one killed.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.001]  Other people have said it looks like a nuke.
[00:43:22.021 --> 00:43:23.443]  It does not look like a nuke to me.
[00:43:23.783 --> 00:43:28.087]  That's what ammo dump blowing up from two miles away looks like at night.
[00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:34.512]  I was involved in a suicide bombing in 2004 in an Iraqi National Guard compound.
[00:43:35.153 --> 00:43:41.478]  I got hit by about 2,000 pounds of high explosive in a truck that ran the compound and it leveled a two-story building on me.
[00:43:42.702 --> 00:43:47.185]  Luckily we were all asleep and we were all on the bottom floor and it just leveled it on us and only five people died.
[00:43:47.225 --> 00:43:55.471]  But when I saw the video of that, and that's not a nuke, I can tell you that because there wasn't no secondary shockwave.
[00:43:55.571 --> 00:44:04.177]  You see it popping and fizzling and explosives going off, then it reaches critical mass and blows the entire compound.
[00:44:04.597 --> 00:44:08.680]  But that does look like a SAFR incident where the enemy infiltrates your base and blows it up.
[00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:18.084]  There's two primary explosions and then there's the major one that actually knocks out the pole lights for a second and the camera, but there's no secondary shockwave that comes through town.
[00:44:18.724 --> 00:44:20.845]  So it's not a nuke, but I'm not sure what it is.
[00:44:21.165 --> 00:44:24.826]  Well, there are people on the web, and I don't blame anybody for covering the report.
[00:44:24.846 --> 00:44:28.867]  You've got to look at it and look at what people are saying, but it's the same people every time.
[00:44:29.327 --> 00:44:34.469]  It's Novostat, the Russians, putting out what I like to call is false info from what we have.
[00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:38.350]  And then other people get it, the same usual suspects who parrot everything.
[00:44:39.171 --> 00:44:44.333]  And, uh, but there's nothing wrong with reporting on what's being reported, but to jump on and say everything's a nuke.
[00:44:44.793 --> 00:44:46.553]  Oh, there were nukes in the World Trade Centers.
[00:44:46.673 --> 00:44:47.714]  Oh, there were nukes in this.
[00:44:47.734 --> 00:44:49.034]  There were nukes in Oklahoma City.
[00:44:49.394 --> 00:44:50.134]  No, there weren't.
[00:44:50.655 --> 00:44:58.617]  No, there's information in, uh, in, uh, Popular Mechanics come back out in the mid-90s about how terrorists are planning on using demolition nukes.
[00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:00.838]  I can't remember what year it was.
[00:45:00.858 --> 00:45:04.419]  It was before I went in the Army, but they were just hitting around at it back then.
[00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:07.920]  But you can't really use nukes as demolition anyways, because
[00:45:10.057 --> 00:45:13.338]  Even the Bunker Busters, I mean, there's nothing mini about them.
[00:45:13.658 --> 00:45:15.078]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:45:15.378 --> 00:45:19.519]  Oh, in closing, was anything else said in class when you were handing all this out to people?
[00:45:20.299 --> 00:45:20.639]  Say again?
[00:45:21.339 --> 00:45:24.140]  Was anything else said to you in the class when you were handing out territory?
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.941]  The National Guard guys actually set the... I mean, they knew I was in the military.
[00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:31.741]  They just set the package down and said, hey, thanks for what you're doing and everything, and they walked out.
[00:45:31.781 --> 00:45:34.322]  My teacher, he was actually an elderly person.
[00:45:34.929 --> 00:45:39.873]  And he remembers Vietnam, and it had Northwoods in there, a complete copy of the declassified Northwoods in it.
[00:45:40.353 --> 00:45:45.978]  And he was just looking at me with his jaw just hanging open, because, I mean, everything he's been taught has been a lie.
[00:45:45.998 --> 00:45:56.926]  And then a history professor right afterwards came up to me with a dumbstruck look, because I was in fact handing him a packet telling him he's not really a history professor, he's a lie professor.
[00:45:57.286 --> 00:46:00.429]  Everything he's been taught and he's teaching is nothing but, you know, lies.
[00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:03.871]  And he's just looking at me like, you know, who the hell are you?
[00:46:04.211 --> 00:46:04.792]  What are you doing?
[00:46:07.787 --> 00:46:08.647]  Well, you keep it up.
[00:46:08.707 --> 00:46:21.836]  It's people like you that are going to save this country, and you fought for the globalists overseas, but we know you really fought for your buddies, and now you've woken up, and it takes a lot of courage to wake up, and moral courage is even greater than physical courage history has shown.
[00:46:22.356 --> 00:46:27.840]  And you're fighting for this republic now, sir, in a war that is absolutely life and death, so I salute you.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.721]  We're comrades in arms, my friend.
[00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:31.673]  You have a good day, sir.
[00:46:31.933 --> 00:46:32.854]  You too, take care.
[00:46:33.154 --> 00:46:35.655]  And some of us aren't going to make it out of this.
[00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:37.916]  You have to commit.
[00:46:38.476 --> 00:46:45.639]  This is a fight for your homeland, in your country, for your families, for the Bill of Rights, for everything this country's ever been.
[00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:49.381]  I just want all the real men out there to commit.
[00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:51.181]  Just like the last caller did.
[00:46:51.201 --> 00:46:52.602]  Just like Jeff Dunn from Kentucky.
[00:46:52.622 --> 00:46:54.523]  And do exactly the same type of things he's doing.
[00:46:55.183 --> 00:46:59.445]  Information warfare operations using our sword, our weapon, the truth.
[00:47:00.888 --> 00:47:04.110]  I can't believe those National Guard guys said thank you, but left the package.
[00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:13.834]  They know the truth, but because Jeff was up front about how serious it is, their fear kept them from taking that information.
[00:47:14.755 --> 00:47:15.775]  What's happened to our country?
[00:47:17.316 --> 00:47:18.877]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:47:19.957 --> 00:47:21.758]  John in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:47:22.358 --> 00:47:22.659]  Hi Alex.
[00:47:24.005 --> 00:47:26.486]  Things have been sort of quiet on the gun control front.
[00:47:27.287 --> 00:47:33.390]  I thought with all these school shootings that the press would be raving about, save the kids, take the guns away from everybody, but they've been sort of quiet.
[00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.511]  Well, they've got two different levels to this.
[00:47:35.992 --> 00:47:39.393]  Again, why does the government stage lots of terror attacks they never tell us about?
[00:47:39.433 --> 00:47:49.459]  They tell the police, they tell the military, they tell intelligence officers, they tell FBI, to then have covert control and tell them that's why they're doing all this secret stuff.
[00:47:50.223 --> 00:47:51.604]  And it's the same thing with the schools.
[00:47:51.925 --> 00:48:01.612]  Oh, they're locking them down, putting in fences, searching all the bags, doing psychological testing, engaging the New Freedom Initiative, report psychological testing.
[00:48:02.433 --> 00:48:03.314]  So that was done.
[00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:19.547]  Bush signed an executive order to put total federal control into the schools with the overlaying airlock, I guess, boarding apparatus of the No Child Left Behind that already increased the funding mechanism to inject the vector pathogen.
[00:48:20.303 --> 00:48:24.546]  And so they're already basically in there more now that they've boarded the schools to a full extent.
[00:48:24.586 --> 00:48:27.808]  Now they're going in with the Psychological Re-Education Corps.
[00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:29.889]  These are re-education centers.
[00:48:29.929 --> 00:48:31.470]  So that's really why that was done.
[00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:32.891]  But go ahead.
[00:48:33.272 --> 00:48:48.802]  Okay, but I just, I think that if Nancy Pelosi and John Conyers and the New World Order Democrats get in there, that they're going to, instead of the stealth campaign that George Bush has been doing behind the scenes, we're going to have an overt campaign of numerous gun bills.
[00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:50.091]  Good.
[00:48:50.151 --> 00:48:50.791]  Let it come.
[00:48:50.871 --> 00:48:52.433]  Hey, what did Patrick Henry say?
[00:48:53.074 --> 00:48:56.218]  The clash of arms can already be heard to the north.
[00:48:57.059 --> 00:48:58.220]  And it's already here.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.441]  The war is already here.
[00:48:59.581 --> 00:49:01.524]  Let them take the mask off.
[00:49:01.584 --> 00:49:02.525]  Let them drop the cloak.
[00:49:03.195 --> 00:49:03.656]  Show it!
[00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:04.116]  Show it!
[00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:05.337]  That's what we need.
[00:49:05.717 --> 00:49:07.319]  We need the enemy to come out openly.
[00:49:07.339 --> 00:49:07.959]  And they have been.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:15.686]  With the North American Union, with SPP, with HR 6166, they are, we are, we are now energizing.
[00:49:15.726 --> 00:49:17.188]  We are now rising to meet them.
[00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:23.613]  The giant, the sleeping giant, you know, was starting to shake itself a few years ago and now it's gotten up off the bed.
[00:49:23.974 --> 00:49:25.915]  It's splashing cold ice water on its face.
[00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:27.357]  It's getting red-faced.
[00:49:27.917 --> 00:49:29.138]  It's energizing right now.
[00:49:29.198 --> 00:49:30.739]  I can feel the power up right now.
[00:49:31.099 --> 00:49:33.360]  I think that, you know, we were talking about the internet the other day.
[00:49:33.421 --> 00:49:36.562]  I typed in the Illuminati and Google and I had a ton of stuff come up.
[00:49:36.602 --> 00:49:41.025]  Documentaries, articles, and you're right that the internet is really kicking their butt.
[00:49:41.165 --> 00:49:45.648]  I mean, more so than what the John Birch Society did back in the 60s and 70s because they could marginalize them.
[00:49:45.968 --> 00:49:50.431]  They kept them more or less... Totally dwarf what the John Birch Society did that was a key seed.
[00:49:51.056 --> 00:49:52.297]  Again, we may think we're losing.
[00:49:52.337 --> 00:49:55.220]  We may be in camps five years from now, ten years from now.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.943]  They may nerve gas and bio-attack the country.
[00:49:58.303 --> 00:49:59.024]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:49:59.064 --> 00:50:03.188]  Then the seeds from this will be planted and they'll just keep growing.
[00:50:03.228 --> 00:50:04.129]  They can't stop us.
[00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:09.655]  They're going to prison, they're going to be marched up, and they're going down.
[00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:10.596]  I'm telling you right now.
[00:50:10.856 --> 00:50:13.879]  A lot of us won't live to see it, but we're never going to stop.
[00:50:14.159 --> 00:50:19.213]  They need to look at occupied Europe and the fact that the Germans could never control their occupied areas.
[00:50:19.233 --> 00:50:20.877]  They had guerrilla warfare up the rear end.
[00:50:21.468 --> 00:50:25.551]  And, uh, you think they've taken a lesson from that, that Hungarian revolt and all that?
[00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:26.592]  Well, they have taken a lesson.
[00:50:26.612 --> 00:50:29.874]  That's why they're putting RFID and everything and cameras in the smallest towns.
[00:50:30.374 --> 00:50:31.635]  But that isn't going to matter either.
[00:50:32.075 --> 00:50:35.658]  Because we're going to have the locals fighting on our side, the police and the military.
[00:50:35.998 --> 00:50:38.039]  You know how many Special Forces troops we've got?
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.281]  You know how many former Special Forces we've got?
[00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:41.902]  They're scared to death of us!
[00:50:41.922 --> 00:50:42.863]  We're unstoppable!
[00:50:42.903 --> 00:50:43.923]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:44.344 --> 00:50:46.545]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[00:50:46.765 --> 00:50:50.248]  CruisingPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.801]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.141 --> 00:51:10.062]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.462 --> 00:51:18.125]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.805 --> 00:51:25.848]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.

[00:54:15.134 --> 00:54:20.356]  Hey Alex, first of all, let's say kudos for getting Terror Storm into the major bookstores.
[00:54:20.416 --> 00:54:21.276]  That's great.
[00:54:21.376 --> 00:54:21.757]  It's about time.
[00:54:39.011 --> 00:54:39.571]  Well, thank you.
[00:54:39.852 --> 00:54:40.572]  Please support us.
[00:54:40.972 --> 00:54:42.954]  Please go out and buy them from the stores.
[00:54:43.354 --> 00:54:45.295]  Even if you already have it, just give it as a gift.
[00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:48.197]  That way they restock and more people see it and get it.
[00:54:48.978 --> 00:54:49.598]  Absolutely.
[00:54:50.139 --> 00:54:58.785]  Um, Lucin, I don't know how well aware you are of, uh, disability rights playing a part in bringing in the electronic voting machines.
[00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:02.988]  Um, of course, you know, on the liberal left, we're all equal.
[00:55:03.028 --> 00:55:04.689]  No one's special.
[00:55:05.485 --> 00:55:15.467]  Um, so the disability community, which I work for and happen to advocate for, so I have no problems with that, but I don't, I don't, it's just like the DNA databases for sex offenders.
[00:55:15.547 --> 00:55:17.168]  Once they get their foot in the door with something.
[00:55:17.228 --> 00:55:17.828]  Oh, that's it.
[00:55:17.868 --> 00:55:20.188]  And the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:55:20.208 --> 00:55:21.388]  Evil uses that.
[00:55:21.869 --> 00:55:26.249]  And yeah, I mean, I've seen this, but give us your inside examples of how they're doing this.
[00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:32.851]  Well, the inside examples would be, let's say someone who's a quadriplegic goes to vote and they can't use, um,
[00:55:33.627 --> 00:55:35.389]  A standard paper form ballot.
[00:55:35.689 --> 00:55:40.633]  Now, I happen to work for a gentleman who is quadriplegic, and I assist him in every aspect of his daily life.
[00:55:40.653 --> 00:55:45.698]  Well, that's what happened in the past, is the people that need help, you have local volunteers, and it gets taken care of.
[00:55:46.078 --> 00:55:48.280]  And, you know, he trusts me 100%.
[00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:53.705]  And I still, even with the electronic voting systems, he has to have assistance, and I have to use vote.
[00:55:54.065 --> 00:55:55.707]  Now, do I blurt his vote around?
[00:55:55.767 --> 00:55:57.889]  No, that's not, I have no interest in that.
[00:55:58.587 --> 00:56:01.228]  Well, you know, this started 50 years ago.
[00:56:01.528 --> 00:56:03.169]  Don't let anyone know how you vote.
[00:56:03.249 --> 00:56:04.349]  Don't talk about your vote.
[00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:07.611]  That was the beginning of domesticating us and telling us to shut up.
[00:56:08.151 --> 00:56:10.492]  So what if you're assisting somebody and learn his vote?
[00:56:11.272 --> 00:56:11.752]  Exactly.
[00:56:11.772 --> 00:56:14.033]  And I don't really care how you vote.
[00:56:14.113 --> 00:56:16.154]  That's completely his business.
[00:56:17.099 --> 00:56:24.445]  One more thing is that I have a couple of questions regarding homeschooling and one of the questions regarding how I can be of service to your organization.
[00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:37.015]  The homeschooling, I have a 7 year old and a 4 year old that are being homeschooled and I spend a pretty penny on their curriculum so that they have a good curriculum that I have reviewed and that I approve of.
[00:56:38.736 --> 00:56:40.898]  I wonder if you have any suggestions on curriculums?
[00:56:41.665 --> 00:56:45.970]  And number two, how long do you think we have left to be able to homeschool?
[00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:52.317]  And number three, a point about CPS showing up at our door asking if we've had flu vaccinations.
[00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:54.739]  That's happened?
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:56.201]  That has happened.
[00:56:56.682 --> 00:56:56.962]  To you?
[00:56:57.816 --> 00:57:01.178]  That has happened to my kids and my wife while I was not there.
[00:57:01.258 --> 00:57:04.501]  See, I mean, this is the home of the free land of the brave.
[00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:11.606]  There is no law, you have to take a flu shot, and I've seen this in the news, these reports of this happening, Jesse.
[00:57:11.646 --> 00:57:12.426]  There's no law.
[00:57:12.867 --> 00:57:15.929]  Your wife should never open the door for anybody she doesn't know.
[00:57:15.969 --> 00:57:20.172]  You should have a hole drilled in the door, and you should have a peephole put in.
[00:57:20.732 --> 00:57:23.014]  Never open the door for the nice lady with the clipboard.
[00:57:25.253 --> 00:57:25.993]  And yes, they do.
[00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:27.213]  The schools give lists.
[00:57:27.233 --> 00:57:30.174]  They have you sign that form saying your children won't be in school.
[00:57:30.594 --> 00:57:33.135]  There's no law you have to do that either, but they just get you to do it.
[00:57:33.435 --> 00:57:36.636]  Then that's handed over to CPS for harassment of homeschoolers.
[00:57:37.177 --> 00:57:39.057]  And these people didn't even have children.
[00:57:39.137 --> 00:57:41.398]  The people that came to... Of course they don't.
[00:57:41.538 --> 00:57:42.718]  So your wife was trusting?
[00:57:42.738 --> 00:57:44.299]  Was your wife trusting and let them in?
[00:57:45.279 --> 00:57:45.679]  She was.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:53.262]  If they would have seen one ball of dog hair, one plate in the sink, your children would be gone right now, sir.
[00:57:54.591 --> 00:57:56.432]  These people are cults and demons.
[00:57:56.712 --> 00:57:57.953]  Okay, these are Nazis.
[00:57:58.473 --> 00:58:07.777]  It's total reinforcement to how through our third-party contracts with the state... And by the way, if they're listening right now, go into somebody's house because... Did they try to claim that flu shots were needed?
[00:58:08.977 --> 00:58:17.701]  They did not claim that, to my understanding, and of course this is all being, you know, hearsay through my life, you know... Tell you what, hold off on steel, because I've got to finish this now.
[00:58:17.962 --> 00:58:18.822]  Have you already called steel?
[00:58:20.968 --> 00:58:21.368]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:58:21.388 --> 00:58:22.548]  We'll give him five after telling that.
[00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:23.509]  We've already got him.
[00:58:23.749 --> 00:58:24.429]  Stay there, caller.
[00:58:25.409 --> 00:58:26.950]  Number one, where are you in Texas?
[00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:28.570]  I am in Austin.
[00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.211]  Actually, I'm in Pugerville.
[00:58:30.351 --> 00:58:31.871]  A shameful city of evil.
[00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:33.132]  Stay there.
[00:58:33.192 --> 00:58:34.912]  Just shameful wickedness.
[00:58:35.492 --> 00:58:38.033]  These are the secret police that will rule our world.
[00:58:38.053 --> 00:58:39.193]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.314 --> 00:58:46.195]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:51.468 --> 00:58:58.373]  More than... Big Brother.
[00:58:59.014 --> 00:59:00.095]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.775 --> 00:59:01.916]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.556 --> 00:59:03.357]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.098 --> 00:59:05.038]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.679 --> 00:59:09.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.862 --> 00:59:13.985]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.446 --> 00:59:17.948]  If you just joined us, I wish...
[00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:37.534]  Remaining composed in the last segment, but I was reeling with rage under the surface because I see the news articles where what happens is you homeschool your children, but when you sign that form, which isn't a law, but you sign a form letting them know you're homeschooling, that's handed over to CPS for harassment.
[00:59:38.435 --> 00:59:41.196]  And this has been in the news, but they say it's good.
[00:59:41.877 --> 00:59:45.059]  And then they drop by and try to trick their way into your house
[00:59:46.288 --> 00:59:48.389]  Saying that they want to see the learning environment.
[00:59:48.509 --> 00:59:50.550]  Not even that they even got a message from a neighbor now.
[00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.191]  It's not even that.
[00:59:51.531 --> 00:59:54.352]  Or have you had your vaccines and now it's flu shots.
[00:59:55.113 --> 00:59:58.855]  And right here in Austin they get up on TV and lie and say it's the law to take shots.
[00:59:58.895 --> 00:59:59.655]  There is no law.
[01:00:00.155 --> 01:00:04.578]  They have giant things out at the park at Zilker where thousands of kids line up to get their shots.
[01:00:05.578 --> 01:00:06.719]  It's just all color of law.
[01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:07.599]  It's all frauds.
[01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:12.582]  It's just giant fraud being practiced when you let the CPS in.
[01:00:12.622 --> 01:00:13.222]  They're scanning.
[01:00:14.002 --> 01:00:25.456]  Most of them were abused as children, most of them were CPS themselves, and you know this type of stuff, this type of stuff happens.
[01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:30.138]  And again, in America, this is how we'll be ruled.
[01:00:30.178 --> 01:00:33.481]  We'll have secret police in the guise of social lady.
[01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:34.943]  It's already happening.
[01:00:35.363 --> 01:00:37.165]  It's the new Freedom Initiative from ages 4 to 18.
[01:00:37.645 --> 01:00:45.413]  Now they're saying in Illinois, everybody, pregnant women, and they come and they interrogate and there's no law, no judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:00:46.274 --> 01:00:47.815]  It's already been going on since 6166.
[01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.818]  You know, with Patriot Act, Bush said, well, we've been doing this for years.
[01:00:50.858 --> 01:00:51.319]  They have!
[01:00:52.668 --> 01:00:54.169]  These family courts are just set up.
[01:00:54.209 --> 01:00:56.550]  They have no legal standing.
[01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.851]  They just declare their power.
[01:00:57.891 --> 01:00:58.852]  It's all color of the law.
[01:00:59.552 --> 01:01:01.894]  And they come in your house looking for dirt to take your children.
[01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:06.436]  When did CPS come to visit when you were gone to work, sir?
[01:01:07.237 --> 01:01:09.638]  Caller here in Austin, Texas, Jesse.
[01:01:09.918 --> 01:01:10.699]  When did this happen?
[01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:16.202]  I'm going to say about a month ago, Alex.
[01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:18.043]  Describe what happened quickly because I've got a guest coming up.
[01:01:18.063 --> 01:01:19.124]  I understand.
[01:01:19.204 --> 01:01:20.705]  I appreciate you holding me over.
[01:01:21.983 --> 01:01:31.826]  They showed up, there was a very small minor discrepancy in which someone felt the need to put their business into our business and have CPS come out.
[01:01:32.366 --> 01:01:34.007]  Oh, one of your neighbors?
[01:01:34.847 --> 01:01:35.987]  Right, they found nothing.
[01:01:36.187 --> 01:01:37.167]  What does your neighbor claim?
[01:01:38.388 --> 01:01:41.589]  My neighbor claimed that the kids were left in the car for too long.
[01:01:42.914 --> 01:01:48.999]  And, uh, you know, it's one of those things, you get the kids loaded up, oops, forgot something, run back in the house, get it together, run back out to the car.
[01:01:49.019 --> 01:02:01.009]  No, no, no, that's your secret police America, they're just, they don't care if there's illegal aliens walking by their house, and they don't care if there's drug dealers, they don't care if the country's imploding and the president's a criminal, but, hey, let's tattle on our neighbors, sure.
[01:02:01.249 --> 01:02:03.831]  Okay, so then they said, have they had their flu shots?
[01:02:04.332 --> 01:02:08.395]  And then they come in, and like you said, they're scanning everything like robots, and, uh,
[01:02:09.099 --> 01:02:15.161]  You know, and this is all according to my wife, but, uh, she also said that they asked, um, well, are they up to date on all of their shots?
[01:02:16.022 --> 01:02:19.323]  And she replied, she, she laid it off on me and that's fine.
[01:02:19.343 --> 01:02:24.945]  You know, she said, well, you know, Jesse's a little bit of a conspiracy theorist and he does not want them to have their flu shots.
[01:02:25.585 --> 01:02:30.347]  And, you know, and, you know, so she, you know, tried to be as diplomatic about it.
[01:02:30.407 --> 01:02:32.848]  Which is the absolute wrong thing to do.
[01:02:32.888 --> 01:02:33.468]  I understand.
[01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:35.429]  Well, this is a new awakening for her.
[01:02:36.278 --> 01:02:44.563]  Um, so, as have been many events in the past few years, um, so, you know, she just said, no, they are not up to date on their shots.
[01:02:44.964 --> 01:02:47.825]  Yeah, but see, you should say, hey, there's no law, lady.
[01:02:48.086 --> 01:02:52.228]  What are you doing here at my house with something that isn't a law, you piece of trash?
[01:02:52.548 --> 01:02:56.651]  Hey, Alex, they better be damn happy that I was not there whenever they showed up at my door.
[01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:57.952]  Listen, you don't answer the door.
[01:02:57.972 --> 01:02:59.573]  The best thing is give them nothing.
[01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.492]  The police gotta have a warrant to get in your house.
[01:03:02.752 --> 01:03:04.233]  These people will try to push their way in.
[01:03:04.253 --> 01:03:07.115]  Let me tell you, they profile and they hire mental patients.
[01:03:07.475 --> 01:03:09.477]  Let me tell you, they hire somebody who was abused.
[01:03:09.877 --> 01:03:11.458]  Generally, it's multi-generational.
[01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.940]  Most CPS are foster children.
[01:03:14.441 --> 01:03:14.761]  Okay?
[01:03:14.801 --> 01:03:20.105]  Most of them have been gang-raped and on drugs and they're mental patients or they're pedophiles.
[01:03:20.145 --> 01:03:22.587]  And that's statistically, criminology will tell you that.
[01:03:22.647 --> 01:03:24.168]  Five times more likely to be pedophiles.
[01:03:24.928 --> 01:03:25.428]  Absolutely.
[01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.669]  And they're there to get a hold of kids, okay?
[01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:29.130]  They're the scum of the earth.
[01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:32.271]  They're the absolute, total scum of earth.
[01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:36.393]  I want you to... FightCPS.com Yeah, FightCPS.com.
[01:03:36.433 --> 01:03:37.433]  Is that what you said?
[01:03:37.853 --> 01:03:38.053]  Yes.
[01:03:38.834 --> 01:03:39.954]  Alright, I appreciate you, sir.
[01:03:39.994 --> 01:03:42.675]  You tell your wife she's woken up into the Matrix.
[01:03:43.015 --> 01:03:44.336]  Don't ever open the door.
[01:03:44.756 --> 01:03:50.118]  Because statistically, there's no one more dangerous for children than these creeps.
[01:03:56.306 --> 01:03:59.308]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.749 --> 01:04:01.710]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:09.736]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:17.462]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.862 --> 01:04:24.747]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.225 --> 01:04:29.267]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.567 --> 01:04:33.088]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.548 --> 01:04:35.449]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:39.710]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:54.770]  Good morning, honey!
[01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.671]  Wow!
[01:04:55.851 --> 01:05:01.116]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:05:01.416 --> 01:05:02.017]  Yeah.
[01:05:02.397 --> 01:05:03.818]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:07.582]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:05:08.042 --> 01:05:09.564]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:05:09.984 --> 01:05:11.686]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:05:12.086 --> 01:05:13.848]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:05:14.048 --> 01:05:14.989]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.573]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:05:17.853 --> 01:05:18.154]  What?
[01:05:18.594 --> 01:05:29.068]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:05:29.368 --> 01:05:29.609]  You know?
[01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:31.531]  This is a terrific cabin!
[01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:32.572]  And wow!
[01:05:32.792 --> 01:05:34.234]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:05:34.534 --> 01:05:35.715]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:05:52.728 --> 01:05:56.310]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:57.450]  Look no further!
[01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.312]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:06:00.732 --> 01:06:09.156]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:06:09.616 --> 01:06:09.876]  I think so.
[01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:40.715]  We have a Nobel Prize winner.
[01:07:09.366 --> 01:07:17.171]  Former Chief Economist for the World Bank, joining us, Joseph Stiklitz, tomorrow.
[01:07:18.672 --> 01:07:23.755]  And we are one inch away from Kevin Tillman, Pat Tillman's brother, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:25.176 --> 01:07:28.918]  We are one inch away from having him here for you.
[01:07:28.938 --> 01:07:32.060]  We had Gore Vidal earlier this week, Aaron Russo.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.582]  We just, I tell you, Kevin is knocking them out of the park with his producing.
[01:07:37.225 --> 01:07:38.887]  Give credit where credit is due.
[01:07:38.947 --> 01:07:41.809]  We have Robert David Steele joining us.
[01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:45.833]  We have a link to the Wikipedia encyclopedia run down on him.
[01:07:45.873 --> 01:07:49.016]  I don't know how accurate that is, but it meshes with other research I've done on him.
[01:07:49.996 --> 01:07:51.458]  And Robert David Steele.
[01:07:52.529 --> 01:08:00.392]  He is a former Marine Corps Infantry and Intelligence Officer for 20 years and was a second-ranking civilian GS-14 in the Marine Corps Intelligence from 88 to 92.
[01:08:00.832 --> 01:08:05.194]  Steele is a former clandestine service case officer with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:07.795]  He is the founder and CEO of OSS.net.
[01:08:07.815 --> 01:08:09.975]  We have a link to that on Infowars.com if you forgot it.
[01:08:10.896 --> 01:08:13.677]  And as well as the Golden Candle Society.
[01:08:14.797 --> 01:08:15.417]  He founded that.
[01:08:15.497 --> 01:08:19.379]  Steele also was a member of the adjunct faculty of Marine Corps University in the mid-1990s.
[01:08:20.994 --> 01:08:25.418]  And he is one of the biggest, or the biggest, reviewer for Amazon.com of non-fiction books.
[01:08:25.818 --> 01:08:27.419]  Over 700 books.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.543]  And there have been a lot of reports written since he decided to valiantly go public.
[01:08:32.844 --> 01:08:45.273]  We had Bill Christensen, who was over the entire foreign threat analysis group of the CIA, in the top ten of the CIA for many years on, saying he cried over it.
[01:08:45.313 --> 01:08:47.255]  He couldn't believe it took him two years of research
[01:08:47.995 --> 01:08:51.479]  And unfortunately, all evidence points towards quote, total inside job.
[01:08:51.499 --> 01:08:58.326]  That's the only, only, with the data he has in two years of research, it's the only one that fits.
[01:08:58.566 --> 01:08:59.567]  Sure, let it happen.
[01:08:59.607 --> 01:09:00.608]  We're involved a little.
[01:09:01.008 --> 01:09:03.131]  That fits, but not with all the other info.
[01:09:03.151 --> 01:09:05.113]  So, it's horrifying.
[01:09:05.173 --> 01:09:05.653]  It's true.
[01:09:05.873 --> 01:09:06.594]  It's here.
[01:09:07.315 --> 01:09:10.318]  Robert David Steele has read a bunch of books on this subject.
[01:09:11.021 --> 01:09:17.844]  Well, it's my pleasure, and as we were talking before, Amazon is really a very valuable place where people can read opinions that are almost as good as the books themselves.
[01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:41.028]  So you can search for the truth on Amazon.
[01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:41.949]  Well, that's right.
[01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:47.071]  I mean, I catch myself some nights for an hour just on Amazon reading the reviews.
[01:09:47.111 --> 01:09:50.753]  Some of them are 10-page treatise.
[01:09:50.933 --> 01:09:53.174]  And I found out about other books and other videos.
[01:09:53.274 --> 01:09:53.734]  It's great.
[01:09:54.094 --> 01:09:59.617]  Well, they do have a thousand-word limit, and I actually do count my words before I post it.
[01:10:00.337 --> 01:10:03.679]  But I try to write summative reviews, not just evaluative reviews.
[01:10:04.507 --> 01:10:09.670]  And I believe we're paying the price right now for our entire citizenry dropping out.
[01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:14.392]  We have let these guys just get away with murder for too long.
[01:10:15.373 --> 01:10:16.473]  Now, you're a Republican.
[01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:18.214]  You're a highly respected conservative.
[01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:24.457]  Well, I don't know if I'm highly respected and a conservative, but I'm certainly a moderate, middle-of-the-road Republican.
[01:10:24.497 --> 01:10:28.119]  Well, I did several days of research on you, and I know that you've been
[01:10:28.743 --> 01:10:35.587]  You've been cited and quoted a lot by the Republicans, and I mean, I've been a Republican, you know, going back 15 years ago.
[01:10:35.627 --> 01:10:37.969]  I stopped being one about 8 years ago, 9 years ago.
[01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:41.751]  But my point is, you're not some liberal with an axe to grind.
[01:10:42.212 --> 01:10:48.856]  No, as a matter of fact, it was the Tarpley book that took me to a new place, if you will.
[01:10:50.717 --> 01:10:57.722]  I have said on air, and I've read them all, folks, that that is the most sophisticated, basically what I...
[01:10:58.857 --> 01:11:12.507]  The conclusions I have come to, studying government sponsored tariff for 10 years, and what I've come to on 9-11, he put it all together in a way that I've tried to articulate on air, but you really can't do in a radio format.
[01:11:12.748 --> 01:11:13.508]  He gets it.
[01:11:14.449 --> 01:11:21.254]  I agree with you, and I think what I would say is that I'm still not convinced, and I was just looking at the review that I did on Amazon,
[01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:27.697]  I'm still not convinced enough to convict, but I am most certainly convinced enough to say the U.S.
[01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:32.684]  government did not properly investigate this and there are more rocks to be turned over.
[01:11:33.601 --> 01:11:36.242]  Well, I can read your quotes, they're actually pretty powerful.
[01:11:36.282 --> 01:11:47.584]  You're saying you believe that there should be a criminal investigation, and that there is enough to go after these people, and that once that opened up, that we would find quite a bit.
[01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:54.105]  Can you go over your awakening, your research, when you started looking into 9-11, and kind of the rundown?
[01:11:54.866 --> 01:12:01.367]  Well, my first impression was the impression that they wanted us all to have.
[01:12:02.721 --> 01:12:19.274]  But where it really started breaking down for me was when I read about the, not only the 11 countries that had given us warning prior to 9-11, but the 9-11 Commission did not speak to the general in charge of the watch of the National Intelligence Command Center.
[01:12:20.175 --> 01:12:21.536]  He avoided testimony.
[01:12:21.996 --> 01:12:28.261]  And then when I heard about the 100,000 from the Pakistani Intelligence Service to one of the hijackers right before 9-11,
[01:12:30.219 --> 01:12:42.805]  That really started a cascade of unexplained issues that Tarpley, I think, together with Crossing the Rubicon and several others, I've posted a list of books suitable for evaluating Dick Cheney.
[01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:48.028]  There's no question in my own mind that Dick Cheney is the Tar Baby in this thing.
[01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:49.651]  I agree.
[01:12:49.691 --> 01:12:51.052]  He is the nexus point.
[01:12:51.572 --> 01:12:57.718]  Clearly, with the PNAC documents, clearly two months before 9-11, taking the shoot-down powers for the first time in U.S.
[01:12:57.738 --> 01:13:01.982]  history, away from the Pentagon, away from NORAD.
[01:13:02.603 --> 01:13:07.828]  You then have him in control that morning, in the bunker, saying the order still stands, it's 50 miles out, it's 30, it's 20, it's 10.
[01:13:08.809 --> 01:13:09.269]  Right.
[01:13:09.349 --> 01:13:10.490]  Of course the order still stands.
[01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:11.651]  You heard anything to the contrary.
[01:13:12.332 --> 01:13:17.096]  Then you get into the CIA drills, the lies, claiming they never heard of such a plan.
[01:13:17.156 --> 01:13:24.522]  Clearly foreign intelligence was picking up InfoPoll 9 and Echelon feeds, picking up the back chatter.
[01:13:25.002 --> 01:13:34.950]  FBI that picked up the chatter tried to go bust at least the Patsy's and the Moles, who were creating the legend and the story, were being protected from the highest levels.
[01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:36.071]  Would you like to continue?
[01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:41.053]  Well, I'm not sure I'm as far over as you are in the conspiracy theory.
[01:13:41.493 --> 01:13:44.815]  If I'm given a choice between incompetence and conspiracy with the U.S.
[01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:46.495]  government, I'll usually go with incompetence.
[01:13:46.915 --> 01:13:51.117]  But I am absolutely certain that WTC7 was brought down with controlled demolition.
[01:13:51.657 --> 01:13:56.699]  And that, as far as I'm concerned, means that this case has not been properly investigated.
[01:13:56.839 --> 01:13:58.020]  And that was a spookhive!
[01:13:58.662 --> 01:14:00.245]  Well, it was a government building.
[01:14:00.285 --> 01:14:02.008]  It was a federal government building, yes.
[01:14:02.128 --> 01:14:05.935]  Would you call Defense Intelligence, FBI, CIA, the Army?
[01:14:05.955 --> 01:14:07.197]  I mean, it was a spookhive.
[01:14:08.038 --> 01:14:11.885]  Well, there's no way that building could have come down without controlled demolition.
[01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:17.457]  And do you notice how they act suspicious and very secretive?
[01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:20.579]  Not one word in the 9-11 Commission about it.
[01:14:21.139 --> 01:14:23.661]  Five different reasons from FEMA and NIST for the collapse.
[01:14:23.701 --> 01:14:25.762]  Now they're saying they're having to look at explosions.
[01:14:26.483 --> 01:14:36.770]  I mean, clearly, why did they... I mean, obviously, Al-Qaeda couldn't sneak in there and plant bombs to bring it down with that perfect classical textbook job.
[01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:40.893]  Well, I mean, you do have the whole issue of
[01:14:41.913 --> 01:14:49.600]  The security cameras being disengaged, the bomb-sniffing dogs being removed, the family ties with Bush.
[01:14:50.359 --> 01:14:54.620]  You know, I mean, if you smell rotten fish, there's probably a rotten fish somewhere around.
[01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:59.622]  Well, I mean, taking your skills, I mean, you were in the field with the Marine Corps.
[01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.402]  You did, you know, serious clandestine operations.
[01:15:02.422 --> 01:15:08.764]  I mean, you've got a snout for smelling rotten fish, but I mean, we're in a giant, you know, bucket of rotten fish here.
[01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.805]  I mean, it's hard to come away with a conclusion.
[01:15:12.025 --> 01:15:13.126]  You think I want to believe this?
[01:15:13.146 --> 01:15:14.006]  I don't want to believe this.
[01:15:14.246 --> 01:15:18.287]  Well, there I agree with you, and I frankly am stunned.
[01:15:19.795 --> 01:15:22.416]  I think the American public is just starting to wake up.
[01:15:23.176 --> 01:15:29.940]  But I have been stunned that the numerous discrepancies haven't made it onto CNN.
[01:15:31.281 --> 01:15:34.503]  Lou Dobbs is doing a very good job on broken government.
[01:15:35.123 --> 01:15:46.970]  In fact, I'm featuring a secessionist speaker from Vermont at my conference in January because I believe this is a republic and that the citizens can dissolve the government when it gets to
[01:15:47.606 --> 01:15:52.854]  A point of corruption and ineffectiveness so great as to warrant a new constitutional convention.
[01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:55.759]  I think our government is indeed broken.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.081]  Well, but from their view, it's not broken.
[01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:16.712]  We are seeing an imperium form of select global corporations that have brought off our government and they're using, dissolving us as not even an engine, but a fuel for an engine for global hegemon that I think we're later going to be basically broken up into the... You know, I think you're right.
[01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:21.595]  I take a very strong interest in what's called predatory immoral capitalism.
[01:16:22.302 --> 01:16:35.531]  And I would like to mention a book by Michael Lewis called Liar's Poker, which is basically an insider's look at how Wall Street gets into all of these investments early on, and then they leave the citizens holding the bag.
[01:16:36.372 --> 01:16:46.579]  And so, in my view, we have never had as much concentration of wealth among the fewest Americans in our history.
[01:16:47.119 --> 01:16:50.742]  And concentrated wealth is one of the things that leads to revolution.
[01:16:52.176 --> 01:16:55.798]  Yeah, and the neocons will say, oh, you're against free market.
[01:16:56.138 --> 01:16:58.079]  Much of this has not been gained through free market.
[01:16:58.119 --> 01:17:08.424]  It's been gained through mafia triads working in unison to basically extract corporate welfare to fuel their expansion.
[01:17:08.784 --> 01:17:15.008]  Well, one of the things, if you've read John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hitman... Yes, we have interviewed him, yes.
[01:17:15.528 --> 01:17:16.768]  Well, that's good.
[01:17:16.828 --> 01:17:20.910]  I don't think he worked for NSA, but I think there's enough meat to his story so that I'd buy 85% of it.
[01:17:22.441 --> 01:17:41.407]  And what I find really astonishing, and there's another book called The Global Class War, basically the American elite has conspired with other public elites, they've bribed other governments, and essentially the American public is being ripped off at the same time that foreign publics are being ripped off.
[01:17:41.427 --> 01:17:42.727]  Well, that's right, it's a mass looting.
[01:17:42.787 --> 01:17:44.507]  I mean, that's the CFR model.
[01:17:44.728 --> 01:17:49.629]  Not only is it mass looting, but those foreigners blame us.
[01:17:51.443 --> 01:17:52.923]  I mean, they blame us, the people.
[01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:53.623]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:17:53.643 --> 01:17:55.224]  We've been set up to take the fall later.
[01:17:55.464 --> 01:17:55.684]  Yes.
[01:17:56.744 --> 01:17:57.324]  Oh, you really?
[01:17:57.424 --> 01:17:58.424]  Oh, I tell you, you've got it.
[01:17:58.504 --> 01:17:59.085]  Absolutely.
[01:18:00.345 --> 01:18:03.385]  I mean, in fact, I see Rupert Murdoch overseas attacking America.
[01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:09.427]  Meanwhile, he puts out domestic propaganda to keep us in line until it's too late, and they're just shutting us up.
[01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:10.767]  It's a big scam.
[01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:17.468]  Well, one of the reasons, I just published a book, and I've got to say there's a really fantastic congressman in Connecticut.
[01:18:17.508 --> 01:18:20.909]  Congressman Rob Simmons is a moderate Republican.
[01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:29.520]  He's going into, he's running for his fourth term, he's on the Homeland Security Committee, and he has agreed to sponsor the Smart Nation Act.
[01:18:30.201 --> 01:18:35.642]  And what I really want to do is create a public intelligence network that is of, by, and for the people.
[01:18:35.802 --> 01:18:37.623]  Yes, that's what it is.
[01:18:37.643 --> 01:18:38.483]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:18:38.503 --> 01:18:48.486]  Well, just using only legal, ethical information, but I absolutely believe now that the collective intelligence of the American people is superior.
[01:18:51.545 --> 01:18:59.246]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:00.447 --> 01:19:05.248]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:05.468 --> 01:19:08.208]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:08.248 --> 01:19:09.369]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:15.290]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:23.494]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:19:24.495 --> 01:19:27.557]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:33.141]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.712]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.193 --> 01:22:04.139]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:08.823]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office?
[01:22:09.044 --> 01:22:17.331]  We continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[01:22:18.192 --> 01:22:19.694]  The handwriting is on the wall.
[01:22:19.714 --> 01:22:28.403]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.785]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[01:23:18.136 --> 01:23:19.917]  We've got to get him back on as a routine guest.
[01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:21.838]  Let him talk more about the book he just published.
[01:23:22.018 --> 01:23:23.038]  An amazing individual.
[01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:26.360]  High level Marine Corps intelligence, then with the CIA.
[01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:31.463]  And we're honored to have Robert David Steele.
[01:23:31.483 --> 01:23:33.064]  In fact, he's never heard of me.
[01:23:33.124 --> 01:23:34.545]  I've never talked to him.
[01:23:34.605 --> 01:23:38.187]  And here he is talking about this organic intelligence network, the people.
[01:23:38.846 --> 01:23:46.052]  And how that interfaces with the internet and how we're able to track the information and be so effective without the political blinders that are put on.
[01:23:46.293 --> 01:23:48.314]  Please continue, sir, then I want to get into 9-11.
[01:23:49.656 --> 01:23:53.259]  Well, I believe in the common sense of the American people.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:24:01.986]  I believe that the American people have been dormant for too long and they need to take their country back.
[01:24:03.227 --> 01:24:04.849]  Not only from illegal immigration,
[01:24:05.342 --> 01:24:11.964]  But from corrupt Congress members and from extremists in the White House.
[01:24:13.644 --> 01:24:15.225]  The middle road is the best road.
[01:24:15.785 --> 01:24:23.547]  And I am concerned that we won't do enough housecleaning in this November election.
[01:24:24.107 --> 01:24:25.528]  And we're going to waste two more...
[01:24:32.014 --> 01:24:33.916]  We're going to waste two more years.
[01:24:34.056 --> 01:24:42.903]  I will tell you some of the experts that I've talked to and listened to basically say it's going to take 25 years to undo the damage that George Bush and Dick Cheney have done to this country.
[01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:45.605]  We have lost our moral standing in the world.
[01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:50.809]  We have lost more dead in the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq than were murdered on 9-11.
[01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:55.793]  And we have the bonus of 65,000 amputees whose lives have been ruined.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.183]  Uh, and a two trillion dollar future debt for this war.
[01:25:00.243 --> 01:25:04.125]  And they've salted the earth with DU and Bush's signed H.R.
[01:25:04.386 --> 01:25:07.628]  6166 that I've read and the scholars agree does affect citizens.
[01:25:08.048 --> 01:25:10.830]  He's buying billions in fake news and paying off reporters.
[01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:12.551]  I think they're going for broke.
[01:25:12.731 --> 01:25:16.114]  I mean, using your intelligence analyst skills
[01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:19.555]  I mean, everything I see shows they're going for broke.
[01:25:19.595 --> 01:25:22.616]  I mean, even Bob Woodward says he may be going for dictatorship.
[01:25:22.856 --> 01:25:24.156]  They could start a war with Iran.
[01:25:24.196 --> 01:25:25.616]  They could stage more terror attacks.
[01:25:25.977 --> 01:25:27.697]  I mean, what do you think the probability of that is?
[01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:30.098]  I am very concerned.
[01:25:30.338 --> 01:25:39.500]  And there's actually a book out called The Endgame, in which a General McInerney and another officer basically lay out the neocon plan.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.281]  And you can find that book on Amazon.
[01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:42.861]  I don't particularly recommend buying it.
[01:25:43.499 --> 01:25:53.944]  But it is a very, very serious agenda for basically after Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Jordan.
[01:25:54.444 --> 01:25:59.126]  These guys are looking at nothing less than nuking them back into the Stone Age and keeping the oil.
[01:25:59.567 --> 01:26:00.587]  That's just nuts!
[01:26:01.487 --> 01:26:04.549]  But the real target in all of this is also the West.
[01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:13.113]  During this psychological clash like in 1984, but in the real world, Oceania being knocked back into the Stone Age liberty-wise.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.241]  I find it troubling.
[01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:20.661]  Iraq is never going to be a democracy like ours.
[01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:24.342]  And if they had a vote tomorrow, they would vote for a theocracy.
[01:26:24.602 --> 01:26:26.823]  But the neocons said they never intended that.
[01:26:26.843 --> 01:26:34.064]  They just told the public that they meant to break it in three parts and basically go into each country and break it down and make sure they never develop.
[01:26:34.524 --> 01:26:41.066]  Well, I don't know what they were thinking, but I will tell you that the same week that Cheney was meeting secretly with Exxon and Enron,
[01:26:42.185 --> 01:26:49.630]  Wired Magazine published a very intelligent cover story on alternative energies and the price points at which they become affordable.
[01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:51.251]  Well, they all just became affordable.
[01:26:52.972 --> 01:26:53.673]  Absolutely.
[01:26:55.594 --> 01:26:58.056]  So what do you see happening in the next two years?
[01:26:59.105 --> 01:27:00.325]  I'm very troubled.
[01:27:00.525 --> 01:27:01.646]  I mean, I'm really worried.
[01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.286]  This is a wonderful country.
[01:27:04.326 --> 01:27:08.808]  You fly across this country, you see so much wide open space and stuff.
[01:27:08.948 --> 01:27:15.769]  But, you know, I have on my website, OSS.net, I have the 10 threats.
[01:27:15.809 --> 01:27:25.312]  I have a public daily brief and the 10 threats identified by the United Nations, which our federal government ignores, all but 8 and 9, proliferation and terrorism.
[01:27:26.455 --> 01:27:29.617]  And then there are 12 policies, and one of those policies is water.
[01:27:30.057 --> 01:27:32.099]  This country is running out of water.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:35.242]  There are going to be water wars all over the world.
[01:27:36.162 --> 01:27:49.493]  We, and the Comptroller General, who's a very serious man, David Walker, he's appointed for a 15-year position, he's been telling Congress over and over and over, in the harshest possible terms, that we're not budgeting for the future.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:53.221]  Well, I mean, sir, I look at LCRA here in Central Texas.
[01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:57.823]  They're grabbing up all the water to shut it off to artificially jack up prices.
[01:27:58.483 --> 01:28:06.246]  Well, that shouldn't be allowed either, but I will tell you that we should be paying, and this may shock you, we should be paying as much for water as we're paying for gas now.
[01:28:08.307 --> 01:28:09.067]  It's just crazy.
[01:28:09.107 --> 01:28:14.129]  I mean, you know, an aquifer, once it runs out of water and salt water comes in, is gone for 10,000 years.
[01:28:15.464 --> 01:28:19.986]  We should be building, it costs a hundred million dollars to build water desalination plants.
[01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:31.152]  We should be putting two into California, two into Texas, two into Florida, and we should be pumping fresh, distilled seawater, converted into plain water, back into the aquifers.
[01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.394]  Yeah, no one's planning for the future, you're right.
[01:28:34.454 --> 01:28:41.117]  Stay there, let's get back into 9-11 on the other side with our guest, an amazing individual, Robert Steele.
[01:28:43.869 --> 01:28:46.871]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.791 --> 01:28:50.553]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.674 --> 01:28:59.617]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:29:06.766 --> 01:29:07.247]  We're good.
[01:29:26.408 --> 01:29:26.748]  I think so.
[01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:58.906]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.067 --> 01:30:07.155]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.415 --> 01:30:14.462]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:15.403 --> 01:30:21.887]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:22.087 --> 01:30:27.171]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:36.177]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:30:36.437 --> 01:30:39.720]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.821 --> 01:30:42.162]  We're good.
[01:30:54.884 --> 01:31:00.326]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:31:00.746 --> 01:31:05.487]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:31:05.867 --> 01:31:08.508]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:08.988 --> 01:31:12.409]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.170 --> 01:31:17.511]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:17.951 --> 01:31:21.132]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:21.732 --> 01:31:24.573]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:27.491]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:27.531 --> 01:31:29.572]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:29.592 --> 01:31:29.632]  U.S.
[01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:31.712]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:31:31.732 --> 01:31:32.092]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:31:32.473 --> 01:31:32.933]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:32.993 --> 01:31:33.473]  Ask for George.
[01:31:56.505 --> 01:31:59.006]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:31:59.506 --> 01:32:06.148]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.248 --> 01:32:13.870]  Before this hour ends, we'll take a few calls for Mr. Steele, former Marine Corps Intelligence Officer, former CIA Intelligence Officer.
[01:32:15.951 --> 01:32:20.753]  He's one of the biggest, the biggest fiction, non-fiction reviewer on Amazon.com.
[01:32:21.253 --> 01:32:23.113]  And he's reviewed a bunch of 9-11 books and videos.
[01:32:23.133 --> 01:32:23.573]  Listen to this.
[01:32:23.593 --> 01:32:26.594]  9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA, 3rd edition.
[01:32:26.614 --> 01:32:30.296]  And he says, among hundreds of books, the strongest approach to truth.
[01:32:31.356 --> 01:32:37.718]  It is with great sadness that I conclude that this book is the strongest of the 770 plus books I have reviewed here at Amazon.
[01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:40.163]  Almost all non-fiction.
[01:32:40.203 --> 01:32:44.747]  I am forced to conclude that 9-11 was at minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war.
[01:32:45.307 --> 01:32:47.509]  See my review of James Bamford's Pretext for War.
[01:32:47.909 --> 01:32:51.472]  And I am forced to conclude that there is sufficient evidence to indict...
[01:32:52.193 --> 01:32:59.979]  Not necessarily convict Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and others of the neo-conservative, neo-Nazi coup d'etat and kick off the clash of civilizations.
[01:33:00.499 --> 01:33:03.642]  See my review of Crossing the Rubicon as well as the State of Denial.
[01:33:04.302 --> 01:33:10.547]  Most fascinatingly, the author, like Samuel Huntington, author of Clash of Civilizations with Leo Strauss,
[01:33:11.247 --> 01:33:13.869]  The connecting rod between the Nazi fascists and the neocons.
[01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:24.298]  This is, without question, the most important modern reference of state-sponsored terrorism, and also the reference that most pointedly suggests that select rogue elements within the U.S.
[01:33:24.338 --> 01:33:34.186]  government, most likely led by Dick Cheney, with the assistance of George Tenet, Buzzy Krongard, and others, close to the Wall Street gangs, are the most guilty of state-sponsored terrorism.
[01:33:35.396 --> 01:33:37.638]  The author draws on historical examples of the U.S.
[01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:44.363]  fabrication of events, the bombing of USS Maine and Havana Harbor, and many others, Jim Vanford's politicization of Northwoods.
[01:33:45.544 --> 01:33:48.066]  It is an undeniable fact that the U.S.
[01:33:48.106 --> 01:33:52.849]  government has been willing to kill its own citizens and fabricate attacks as part of moving the public.
[01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:58.934]  Okay, before we go back to our guest, while he's on hold there, please go to Infowars.com.
[01:34:02.955 --> 01:34:04.436]  That was a hint to the folks running the show.
[01:34:06.498 --> 01:34:17.509]  Please go to InfoWars.com and please get Webster Tarpley's 3rd edition that we have right now of Synthetic Terror.
[01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:18.830]  It's been out for two years.
[01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:19.811]  It's in its 3rd edition.
[01:34:19.831 --> 01:34:20.892]  It's been beefed up.
[01:34:21.833 --> 01:34:24.134]  And it's an excellent, excellent book.
[01:34:24.874 --> 01:34:31.016]  And it goes through how they orchestrate it, how they do it, how they control it, really from all the evidence, how they did 9-11.
[01:34:31.356 --> 01:34:35.537]  You need to have 9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA by Webster Tarpley.
[01:34:35.617 --> 01:34:39.058]  We sell it at InfoWars.com, the secure online video and bookstore.
[01:34:39.438 --> 01:34:41.639]  You get a great book to be a true expert on 9-11.
[01:34:41.839 --> 01:34:43.639]  You support Webster, you support this show.
[01:34:44.099 --> 01:34:50.081]  And while you're at it, get Aaron Russo's new America, Freedom from Fascism, just got on DVD, and my new film, Terror Storm,
[01:34:50.881 --> 01:34:51.641]  Yes, we are.
[01:35:06.927 --> 01:35:12.471]  And I'm here telling you, Terror Storm is the definitive video on government-sponsored terror.
[01:35:13.112 --> 01:35:16.074]  And Webster Tarpley's Synthetic Terror is the definitive book.
[01:35:16.574 --> 01:35:17.134]  I concur.
[01:35:17.334 --> 01:35:22.118]  And I said that long before he did the review, on air, when we had Webster on, telling you, this is the book.
[01:35:22.658 --> 01:35:23.558]  This is the book.
[01:35:23.578 --> 01:35:27.640]  You need to get it at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:27.760]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.740]  So get America Freedom from Fascism.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.641]  Get Terror Storm.
[01:35:30.661 --> 01:35:31.421]  Get Synthetic Terror.

[01:35:34.202 --> 01:35:35.482]  It's so important at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:35.502 --> 01:35:36.903]  When you get Freedom from Fascism for $19.95,
[01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:51.253]  Guess how much Terror Storm is for a limited time?
[01:35:51.273 --> 01:35:51.253]  $9.95.
[01:35:51.453 --> 01:35:54.937]  It's almost two hours long with 68 minutes of extras.
[01:35:55.358 --> 01:35:56.379]  It's a powerful film.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:57.421]  Get Terror Storm.
[01:35:58.041 --> 01:36:01.746]  Going back to our guest, back to Mr. Steele.
[01:36:04.019 --> 01:36:15.689]  Robert Steele, let's get more into 9-11, more into your review, more of what you think the big smoking guns... I mean, that's pretty strong language of you to say, you know, you think we can have an indictment, and I agree.
[01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:31.663]  Please continue, and from your research on 9-11, reading all the big books on it, looking at Tarpley's work, if it is an inside job, which the evidence points towards... Well, let me move you away from 9-11 and simply look at impeachment.
[01:36:32.959 --> 01:36:38.842]  I've reviewed several books on impeachment, and it's now a documented fact.
[01:36:39.382 --> 01:36:54.529]  And in fact, Al Gore was talked out of contesting the Florida election, but it's a documented fact that Rove stole the Florida election with the connivance of Jeb Bush, disenfranchising 35,000 or more people of color.
[01:36:54.829 --> 01:36:55.429]  That's a fact.
[01:36:55.949 --> 01:36:57.370]  That election was stolen.
[01:36:57.850 --> 01:36:59.151]  And they did it again in 2004 in Ohio, with 12
[01:37:03.283 --> 01:37:09.408]  Twelve districts, again, working through the Secretary of State in Ohio, stole the election.
[01:37:09.988 --> 01:37:15.372]  And that's just unbelievable to me, that then we would have an elective war in Iraq, based on a web of lies.
[01:37:15.873 --> 01:37:21.497]  General Zinni, myself, several others spoke out and said, this is nonsense, that we were called traitors.
[01:37:22.117 --> 01:37:25.060]  Dissent is treason under this administration.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:31.845]  And then you have Katrina, which was an inexcusable bumbling, that alone
[01:37:32.429 --> 01:37:34.070]  Demonstrates this government is incompetent.
[01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:35.310]  You see, I disagree with you.
[01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:45.593]  Reading P-2-O-G, reading the Israeli plan of 83, where they said break Iraq in three parts, sectarian war, good weapons sales, cut off the oil, jack up prices.
[01:37:47.634 --> 01:37:59.097]  Maybe you'll elaborate and maybe I don't disagree, but I look at Katrina, FEMA jammed communications, cut police lines, police had to aim guns at them to stop sabotaging communication, blocking
[01:38:01.882 --> 01:38:07.412]  The Coast Guard coming in, blocking the police and local firemen and others coming in, blocking Walmart.
[01:38:07.733 --> 01:38:09.757]  They wanted that to be as bad as possible.
[01:38:10.646 --> 01:38:13.007]  Then it doesn't matter if they take a hit and look bad in the press.
[01:38:13.347 --> 01:38:18.269]  Then they get to having a bigger disaster, hundreds of billions in no-bid contracts to Halliburton and others.
[01:38:18.329 --> 01:38:20.450]  Then FEMA goes, oh see, we need more power.
[01:38:21.191 --> 01:38:25.673]  I see it as another problem-reaction solution, just like Iraq.
[01:38:25.753 --> 01:38:28.174]  Well, let me tell you what brings this home to us.
[01:38:28.474 --> 01:38:34.396]  What brings this home to us is the explosion in suicide bombings.
[01:38:34.456 --> 01:38:40.099]  There's a wonderful book called Dying to Win by Professor Pate from the University of Chicago.
[01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:45.797]  Suicide, the willingness to commit suicide, changes everything.
[01:38:46.237 --> 01:38:48.798]  Because it is the ultimate asymmetric factor.
[01:38:49.178 --> 01:38:58.242]  What this means is that a suicide bomber is coming to a shopping mall near you, or to an elementary school, and unfortunately we have our own homegrown terrorists.
[01:38:59.303 --> 01:39:03.784]  And we have our own, there's another book called Random Actors, where people just go postal.
[01:39:05.165 --> 01:39:10.127]  So I am very, very concerned that the entire world is becoming very, very unstable
[01:39:10.786 --> 01:39:18.328]  And I'm not sure that these elites really understand that ten years from today, there's not going to be any gated community where they can hide.
[01:39:18.768 --> 01:39:22.970]  They're going to have to do a Ken Lay and die before their estate can be contested.
[01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:25.490]  Oh, that was real suspicious.
[01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:28.171]  I'm just blown away.
[01:39:28.971 --> 01:39:34.413]  And because he didn't have a chance to appeal, his hairs are allowed to keep his ill-gotten means.
[01:39:34.473 --> 01:39:35.213]  That's just wrong.
[01:39:36.298 --> 01:39:38.800]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:47.126]  No, no, certainly in the P2OG plan, they say they're going to stimulate terrorist attacks, they're going to go out and kill people's families.
[01:39:47.566 --> 01:39:56.173]  Actually says this, Pentagon plan, $6 billion program every year, in Iraq, the Middle East, they're going to go stimulate and create terrorists in the name of quote,
[01:39:57.054 --> 01:39:59.796]  You know, widening the war, being able to, quote, go in and get them.
[01:40:00.176 --> 01:40:02.358]  So certainly they are, I mean, I see it this way.
[01:40:02.779 --> 01:40:10.386]  You've got real terrorism, normally not spectacular, a woman going crazy with a knife on a bus, stabbing 14 people, a person blowing themselves up.
[01:40:10.726 --> 01:40:14.409]  You do have that real warfare going on, desperation.
[01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:17.972]  Then you've got the provocateur actions that I see as the lion's share from history.
[01:40:18.253 --> 01:40:20.975]  Then you've got pure state-sponsored events like 9-11.
[01:40:21.936 --> 01:40:23.057]  What's your take on that statement?
[01:40:27.043 --> 01:40:29.025]  Believe it or not, I believe in non-violence.
[01:40:29.765 --> 01:40:31.647]  And I believe that Gandhi had it right.
[01:40:33.088 --> 01:40:36.631]  I also believe in the truth eventually being discovered.
[01:40:36.771 --> 01:40:41.215]  I personally think America needs two Truth and Reconciliation Commissions.
[01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:48.681]  One for all the bad things we've done to the rest of the world, and one for all the bad things we've done to our own public, our poor, our working poor.
[01:40:48.741 --> 01:40:50.462]  Working poor is an oxymoron.
[01:40:50.522 --> 01:40:51.083]  It shouldn't be.
[01:40:52.150 --> 01:40:53.451]  But there's a book by that name.
[01:40:53.511 --> 01:40:58.655]  I mean, we're basically screwing the middle class, and we're screwing the earnest blue-collar workers in this country.
[01:40:58.676 --> 01:40:59.756]  Well, let me bring this up to you.
[01:41:00.517 --> 01:41:06.502]  If you look at the top list, and I've seen this on my shelf over and over, and I was listening to Derry Brownville today, and he had a guest on, talking about it.
[01:41:07.202 --> 01:41:10.725]  And you go to UT to try to hire the top 25 engineering staff.
[01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:13.210]  Three of them are American.
[01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:16.291]  The rest are all from India and China.
[01:41:16.371 --> 01:41:20.733]  You go to Georgetown, again, maybe one is American.
[01:41:20.773 --> 01:41:24.153]  You go to MIT, maybe ten are American.
[01:41:24.574 --> 01:41:25.554]  And then hundreds aren't.
[01:41:25.914 --> 01:41:28.375]  And then they all go back to their countries with the technology.
[01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:32.516]  They all go back with what our forefathers and our incredible genius built.
[01:41:33.116 --> 01:41:35.497]  We were the place where all the inventions came from, everything.
[01:41:36.057 --> 01:41:40.078]  And now we have literally, and I know there's a big group that's intelligent and informed still,
[01:41:41.087 --> 01:41:46.134]  The average American literally has been turned into some type of low-level animal who just feeds their beast.
[01:41:46.194 --> 01:41:58.791]  Well, that's exactly right, because we still have a school system that is not only created to manufacture factory workers, but it's funded based on real estate taxes, which means a lot of people don't get an even break.
[01:41:59.933 --> 01:42:01.975]  You just said it, but see, that's by design.
[01:42:02.315 --> 01:42:03.816]  It's by design they've dumbed them down.
[01:42:03.836 --> 01:42:08.241]  I've got the Department of Education documents going back to the 60s and through the 80s.
[01:42:08.261 --> 01:42:10.002]  I've interviewed the number two at the Department of Education.
[01:42:10.022 --> 01:42:11.444]  They openly said they were there to dumb people down.
[01:42:11.704 --> 01:42:13.446]  But then, Katrina isn't on purpose.
[01:42:13.466 --> 01:42:14.267]  That is the response.
[01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:15.468]  It is on purpose.
[01:42:15.528 --> 01:42:18.411]  I mean, all the evidence shows this is coordinated.
[01:42:18.731 --> 01:42:22.595]  Why do they want to destroy America that was such an engine of their dominance?
[01:42:24.202 --> 01:42:27.965]  I don't know, but I'll tell you what I believe is the solution.
[01:42:28.105 --> 01:42:30.947]  I believe the solution is a public intelligence network.
[01:42:31.507 --> 01:42:37.311]  I think Larry Brilliant at Google is one of the most important people on the planet because of what he can do.
[01:42:38.031 --> 01:42:46.017]  Jimbo Wales from Wikipedia has just put out word that he's willing to spend a hundred million dollars to free key information from copyright.
[01:42:46.817 --> 01:42:52.121]  You have Brewster Kahle with the Internet Archives and he's digitizing books all over the world.
[01:42:53.383 --> 01:43:03.765]  I believe that if we can create an open source agency, such as Congressman Simmons is planning to introduce, that within five years we can cut the secret intelligence budget in half.
[01:43:04.227 --> 01:43:07.150]  Even by two-thirds, from $60 billion down to $20 billion.
[01:43:07.170 --> 01:43:11.534]  Okay, well, sir, now you're an intelligence expert, highest levels of the Marine Corps and CIA.
[01:43:12.154 --> 01:43:13.615]  Average people aren't going to get this.
[01:43:14.276 --> 01:43:30.070]  Again, I organically have come upon this, the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of researchers vetting each other's info, scanning everything, doing research using the NSA-type technology of the search engine drivers to go out and collate as analysts just because, in a hobby,
[01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:32.152]  Well, first off, let me give you the bad news.
[01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:36.796]  Your government is spending $60 billion a year for the 5% of the information they can steal.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.484]  They're spending less than 600 million dollars a year on what's called open source information in multiple languages.
[01:43:56.624 --> 01:44:00.127]  Yeah, they'll pay for millions to find out something that was in a news article a year before.
[01:44:00.147 --> 01:44:11.935]  No, they'll pay billions to have a Lockheed Martin build a secret satellite that can't see into city streets or under jungle canopy.
[01:44:12.536 --> 01:44:18.520]  The point I want to make here is that we are spending way too much money on spies and secrecy
[01:44:18.931 --> 01:44:21.952]  And not nearly enough money on education and diplomacy.
[01:44:23.133 --> 01:44:40.380]  And if we just have consultants, I mean, that's what real companies do, they just have people that go around finding out, I had a guest in here a few weeks ago, working for big companies that just track things for the stock market and different derivatives, and they've just got people all over the world going and talking to average folks.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.621]  I mean, they're getting on-the-ground intelligence.
[01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:48.663]  Yes, and in fact, it's been proven that on-the-ground intelligence is better than what you can get from satellites.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:52.483]  And there's just no substitute for human beings.
[01:44:52.543 --> 01:45:02.439]  Now, what the secret world doesn't want you to know is that public intelligence is a hundred times better than secret intelligence at a tiny fraction of the price.
[01:45:04.949 --> 01:45:07.691]  Well, I mean, what is the power of Google?
[01:45:07.751 --> 01:45:09.052]  Obviously the best search engine.
[01:45:09.092 --> 01:45:10.753]  I mean, I can find out so much.
[01:45:10.853 --> 01:45:11.694]  Cross-reference.
[01:45:12.234 --> 01:45:15.257]  I mean, that really is NSA-type power.
[01:45:15.957 --> 01:45:21.301]  And these guys don't even have that many analysts, from what I've seen, even using that.
[01:45:21.321 --> 01:45:27.366]  In fact, they spend most of their time trying to use the apparatchik of intelligence to cover up their own corporate crimes.
[01:45:27.666 --> 01:45:30.008]  Well, Google has some growing up to do.
[01:45:30.348 --> 01:45:31.709]  I really admire Google.
[01:45:32.049 --> 01:45:34.431]  And I think one of these days it will eat Amazon.
[01:45:34.969 --> 01:45:43.111]  And that'll be a good thing, because the next big thing in information is synthetic information.
[01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:45.971]  That breaks the copyright chains.
[01:45:46.731 --> 01:45:54.313]  So a Google can give you an answer that is synthetically derived from millions of pages that they own free and clear.
[01:45:54.373 --> 01:45:55.333]  Which is new, yeah.
[01:45:55.493 --> 01:45:56.353]  Yes, it is new.
[01:45:56.434 --> 01:45:58.694]  And then if you want, you can pay for the footnotes.
[01:45:59.384 --> 01:46:00.885]  With microcash, a penny at a time.
[01:46:00.905 --> 01:46:03.868]  That's what millions of Americans who are news junkies are now doing.
[01:46:03.888 --> 01:46:07.230]  They go out and grab... I mean, I write articles that are 50 links.
[01:46:07.291 --> 01:46:10.133]  Every sentence is a link, documenting what we've said.
[01:46:10.553 --> 01:46:15.737]  And it's everybody else's information, but we're just collecting it and collating it.
[01:46:15.777 --> 01:46:18.640]  Well, the world brain is coming into effect.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:20.261]  I think we're in about the fourth grade.
[01:46:20.836 --> 01:46:33.299]  The day is going to come when you can go to your computer and type in your zip code, select your issues that matter to you, education, water, health, whatever, and then print out a stoplight chart for who to vote for.
[01:46:35.339 --> 01:46:38.540]  Now I saw Google reporting on five years how they're going to have that.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:48.742]  The problem is Google also says that they're going to use microphones with NSA keyword listening to sell you advertising packages or to sell it to others.
[01:46:48.782 --> 01:46:49.862]  That's total surveillance.
[01:46:50.527 --> 01:47:01.136]  And they're also saying that they're going to tell you who the good politician is, but I don't necessarily believe the coalition that they're going to do, you know, claiming a politician is either pro-gun or anti-gun.
[01:47:01.456 --> 01:47:04.198]  Well, I think there will be cross-checking.
[01:47:04.259 --> 01:47:11.364]  I agree with Eric Schmidt and Larry Page when they say that the answer to bad information is more information.
[01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:16.749]  I think Google has made a very important strategic mistake.
[01:47:17.316 --> 01:47:19.317]  In dealing with the secret elements of the U.S.
[01:47:19.357 --> 01:47:19.718]  government.
[01:47:19.818 --> 01:47:21.199]  That is a huge mistake.
[01:47:21.679 --> 01:47:28.424]  And I'm hoping they'll work their way out of it and basically cut that relationship off.
[01:47:30.245 --> 01:47:30.985]  Please continue.
[01:47:32.186 --> 01:47:46.336]  Well, you know, Google was a little hypocritical when they were refusing to honor a Department of Justice request for information because they were heavily in bed with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of Research and Development, my old friend Rick Steinhiser.
[01:47:47.784 --> 01:47:52.966]  Now, I think Google has to be purer than Caesar's wife.
[01:47:53.327 --> 01:47:59.550]  And I have no problem with their accepting some censorship from China and other places as the price of entry.
[01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:04.973]  But I do have a problem with their having a secret relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:48:05.073 --> 01:48:10.936]  Well, obviously they're getting a lot of their technology from NSA backbone type systems.
[01:48:10.996 --> 01:48:12.117]  No, don't believe that.
[01:48:12.377 --> 01:48:13.318]  Don't believe that at all.
[01:48:13.358 --> 01:48:13.978]  I'll tell you why.
[01:48:14.834 --> 01:48:17.476]  My friend Steve Arnold has written a wonderful book.
[01:48:17.536 --> 01:48:18.697]  It costs $200.
[01:48:18.877 --> 01:48:20.238]  It's called The Google Legacy.
[01:48:20.738 --> 01:48:22.660]  It's the best book on Google.
[01:48:24.041 --> 01:48:28.704]  And the bottom line is what Google has done is invented the low-cost supercomputer.
[01:48:29.264 --> 01:48:35.529]  They have gotten their data centers to the point where they can install an entire data center in 72 hours.
[01:48:36.089 --> 01:48:37.130]  It's plug and play.
[01:48:37.150 --> 01:48:41.433]  They've eliminated the configuration management and the backup issues.
[01:48:41.953 --> 01:48:42.934]  And their price
[01:48:43.846 --> 01:48:48.987]  For a rack is one-third of what IBM or Dell or anyone else would charge.
[01:48:49.127 --> 01:48:49.787]  No, I understand.
[01:48:49.827 --> 01:48:51.707]  In fact, we even know where those data centers are now.
[01:48:51.727 --> 01:48:52.308]  Oh, good for you!
[01:48:53.088 --> 01:48:56.788]  Well, no, I mean, I'm finding it interesting that, I mean, you're right, everybody else is paying.
[01:48:57.168 --> 01:49:02.629]  That's what my IT guy has discovered, is that everybody else is paying two-thirds more than Google is.
[01:49:02.649 --> 01:49:03.310]  That's right.
[01:49:03.490 --> 01:49:10.551]  We're trying to keep that out of a popular understanding, but the point I'm trying to get at here is I've had Google censor us.
[01:49:11.303 --> 01:49:13.925]  And they claim that it's an accident.
[01:49:14.546 --> 01:49:15.546]  They censor our news.
[01:49:15.606 --> 01:49:17.588]  They claim we're a news affiliate, but they censor it.
[01:49:17.968 --> 01:49:24.774]  We've caught them deleting our page views, our views for TerrorStorm, for instance, because they want it out of the top 100.
[01:49:25.234 --> 01:49:26.615]  They keep claiming it's an accident.
[01:49:26.895 --> 01:49:28.136]  So they are being evil.
[01:49:28.196 --> 01:49:29.337]  They have started censoring.
[01:49:29.677 --> 01:49:33.861]  That's very interesting, because Larry Page, I actually know him.
[01:49:34.561 --> 01:49:37.063]  We go to a hackers conference together, and I respect him.
[01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:40.406]  And one of the things he said is, do no harm.
[01:49:41.289 --> 01:49:46.992]  So, if Google is, in fact, starting to do harm, I think it's important that that be documented and publicized.
[01:49:47.492 --> 01:49:52.055]  Well, we've been trying to do that, and they admit, oh, we're accidentally erasing your views, but nobody else's.
[01:49:52.195 --> 01:49:53.016]  We'll be right back, sir.
[01:49:53.036 --> 01:49:56.457]  This is Revenue.
[01:49:56.698 --> 01:49:57.218]  It's here.
[01:49:57.378 --> 01:50:02.121]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.521 --> 01:50:10.125]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.859 --> 01:50:17.903]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.303 --> 01:50:29.710]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:33.612]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.012 --> 01:50:35.913]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.274 --> 01:50:40.096]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.607 --> 01:50:55.448]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:50:55.788 --> 01:50:57.309]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:50:57.730 --> 01:50:57.970]  What?
[01:50:58.330 --> 01:50:58.690]  Again?
[01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:00.732]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:51:00.812 --> 01:51:05.234]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:51:05.455 --> 01:51:06.755]  Why did you do that?
[01:51:06.955 --> 01:51:12.739]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:51:13.039 --> 01:51:14.080]  Are we there yet?
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.261]  for the entire trip.
[01:51:15.501 --> 01:51:17.702]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:51:18.183 --> 01:51:19.183]  Great idea.
[01:51:19.203 --> 01:51:22.025]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.893]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:51:25.094 --> 01:51:29.481]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:51:29.761 --> 01:51:30.082]  Honey!
[01:51:30.888 --> 01:51:32.129]  You're terrific!
[01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:34.031]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[01:51:34.132 --> 01:51:37.535]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:51:37.816 --> 01:51:38.596]  Now can we stop?
[01:51:39.117 --> 01:51:39.838]  I need to go, too.
[01:51:40.138 --> 01:51:44.603]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:49.321 --> 01:52:52.003]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:52:54.044 --> 01:52:56.786]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:56.806 --> 01:53:00.649]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.746 --> 01:53:06.528]  We're going to take a few calls for our guest.
[01:53:06.928 --> 01:53:11.852]  He's agreed to stay with us into the second segment with Webster Tarbly in the next hour.
[01:53:13.013 --> 01:53:28.345]  He is Robert David Steele, and you can go to Infowars.com and link through his bios, the book he just published, and some of the 770 books he's reviewed, the non-fiction he's reviewed, former Marine Corps intelligence, then with the CIA, doing field cases, and that's the stuff that matters.
[01:53:28.865 --> 01:53:31.247]  We're honored to have him with us today.
[01:53:32.359 --> 01:53:34.822]  Just briefly before we talk about Patrick in Michigan and a few others.
[01:53:35.963 --> 01:53:37.545]  Back to Google and the CIA.
[01:53:37.585 --> 01:53:38.807]  I knew they were involved with them.
[01:53:39.147 --> 01:53:47.877]  I knew they moved into some old NASA offices and were interfacing and doing a lot of really creepy stuff and that's when we saw some of the changes start to begin.
[01:53:48.998 --> 01:53:51.501]  Also, we'll have a story that say a million people have read.
[01:53:52.057 --> 01:53:59.926]  And every other search engine has it posted, but Google won't have ours posted, but will have some little bitty blogs posted, because their filter missed it.
[01:54:00.407 --> 01:54:06.134]  And we know Google is filtering us out, and they're doing it to other people now, kind of like
[01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:13.600]  Kind of like you can't link through now, or a lot of the audio won't play on MySpace, won't play YouTube or Google videos.
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:23.342]  And I noticed this weeks before, it was in the New York Post, with Rupert Murdoch fighting with Google and YouTube, now the same thing, saying you can't play your videos.
[01:54:23.662 --> 01:54:26.643]  So we know there's a lot of, it's like Yahoo won't
[01:54:27.455 --> 01:54:31.076]  Allow a YouTube instant message, URL to be sent through.
[01:54:31.216 --> 01:54:32.777]  I mean, we know this stuff's going on, sir.
[01:54:32.957 --> 01:54:35.177]  I've caught them red-handed doing it to a bunch of people.
[01:54:35.777 --> 01:54:37.478]  Can you comment on their CIA connection?
[01:54:38.518 --> 01:54:38.798]  No.
[01:54:38.878 --> 01:54:40.819]  The only thing I know is that they do have one.
[01:54:42.139 --> 01:54:43.219]  And that is through who again?
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.940]  That is through the Office of Research and Development.
[01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:49.421]  And then that ties off into DARPA, doesn't it?
[01:54:49.821 --> 01:54:51.962]  Well, it's the CIA's equivalent of DARPA.
[01:54:51.982 --> 01:54:53.963]  Now, DARPA's doing some very good things.
[01:54:54.303 --> 01:54:55.023]  Strong Angel 3,
[01:54:56.172 --> 01:55:03.878]  Is a free open source software package that can be shared with state and local governments and with non-governmental organizations.
[01:55:03.978 --> 01:55:09.161]  And where I think we're going, and don't misunderstand me, I think Google is one of the greatest things since sliced bread.
[01:55:09.762 --> 01:55:18.228]  Google, the Googleplex, combined with, um, with, um, gosh, what's this, uh, software?
[01:55:18.909 --> 01:55:23.372]  Um, the Googleplex plus Strong Angel plus, um,
[01:55:23.942 --> 01:55:27.985]  There's now an open source software for language translation.
[01:55:28.906 --> 01:55:30.367]  Let me see if I can find it here.
[01:55:30.387 --> 01:55:32.248]  Babblefish.
[01:55:32.948 --> 01:55:33.369]  No.
[01:55:33.389 --> 01:55:34.870]  That's the old one.
[01:55:34.890 --> 01:55:35.750]  No.
[01:55:35.890 --> 01:55:36.511]  Here we go.
[01:55:37.191 --> 01:55:38.152]  It's TeleLanguage.
[01:55:38.692 --> 01:55:46.758]  TeleLanguage is a really fine company and it allows you to basically, if you have an employee that speaks a language, they can be logged on.
[01:55:47.238 --> 01:55:51.021]  And if anyone in your organization needs that language, they can pinch hit.
[01:55:51.545 --> 01:55:57.953]  And if they're too busy, or if it's not appropriate, it can default to a commercial translator in India or Indonesia or someplace else.
[01:55:57.973 --> 01:55:59.114]  Sure, so let me just stop you right there.
[01:55:59.134 --> 01:56:00.976]  Let's fast forward, though, ten years.
[01:56:01.397 --> 01:56:06.183]  Technology now doubling every two, then it'll be every year, then every month, then every hour, then every second.
[01:56:06.643 --> 01:56:08.045]  I mean, this is exponential.
[01:56:09.125 --> 01:56:09.365]  I think?
[01:56:30.408 --> 01:56:37.733]  I almost see this like a type of nanotech in the cyber zone with the RFID now tracking real-world items.
[01:56:38.613 --> 01:56:40.274]  It's almost like the gray goo.
[01:56:40.314 --> 01:56:41.975]  Well, let me give you a few groups here.
[01:56:42.015 --> 01:56:49.399]  First off, I think the machine of choice is going to be the handheld cell phone connected to seeing glasses.
[01:56:49.999 --> 01:56:52.161]  So like the glasses that you wear.
[01:56:52.221 --> 01:56:52.761]  I've worn them.
[01:56:52.801 --> 01:56:53.822]  They're absolutely amazing.
[01:56:53.842 --> 01:56:56.143]  It looks just like your PCs on your desk.
[01:56:57.490 --> 01:57:02.613]  I am a real believer in Alvin Toffler's Revolutionary Wealth, his latest book.
[01:57:03.033 --> 01:57:04.394]  I'm a real believer in C.K.
[01:57:04.494 --> 01:57:07.296]  Prahalad, who's written The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.
[01:57:07.776 --> 01:57:13.519]  I am absolutely persuaded that we can, it's a term I use, information peacekeeping.
[01:57:13.859 --> 01:57:18.041]  I'm absolutely persuaded that we can use information in order to
[01:57:20.017 --> 01:57:23.840]  We've basically established belief systems that lead to both wealth and peace.
[01:57:24.221 --> 01:57:27.163]  And we also, frankly, have to root out evil belief systems.
[01:57:27.663 --> 01:57:28.424]  And that includes... Well, stay there.
[01:57:28.444 --> 01:57:29.245]  We've got a break again.
[01:57:29.265 --> 01:57:30.065]  A hard break, sir.
[01:57:30.366 --> 01:57:30.866]  Stay with us.
[01:57:30.946 --> 01:57:32.067]  Your call is partly coming up.
[01:57:33.808 --> 01:57:38.052]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.844 --> 01:57:54.026]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.687 --> 01:57:55.507]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.247 --> 01:57:57.168]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.828 --> 01:58:01.550]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:06.153]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.393 --> 01:58:10.215]  I said I'd get to some calls, so I might as well do that now.
[01:58:10.235 --> 01:58:12.116]  Then we'll go to Webster Tarpley in just a moment.
[01:58:12.876 --> 01:58:13.957]  Get to one of them right now.
[01:58:13.997 --> 01:58:18.119]  We're talking to Robert David Steele, High Level Marine Corps,
[01:58:18.786 --> 01:58:22.087]  Intelligence, then with the CIA, clandestine operations in the field.
[01:58:23.788 --> 01:58:27.550]  You know, the real deal, folks, not the person in a desk at a cubicle.
[01:58:28.130 --> 01:58:35.853]  And he's talking about revolutions in science, technology, information, which threatens the elite, so they're trying to use it every way they can to track and control us.
[01:58:36.593 --> 01:58:39.574]  And I'm not optimistic about it, because the public's so sluggish.
[01:58:39.994 --> 01:58:43.996]  If we had Thomas Jefferson-type for this power, with this information, it'd be over.
[01:58:44.056 --> 01:58:46.217]  We'd be on Alpha Centauri's in ten years.
[01:58:47.346 --> 01:58:48.287]  Not probably going to happen.
[01:58:48.347 --> 01:58:50.769]  Probably going to be more like the Morlocks and the Eloy.
[01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.931]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:58:53.211 --> 01:59:01.077]  He's been talking about 9-11, Inside Job, and his review of Tarpley's book as the preeminent book on the subject.
[01:59:01.597 --> 01:59:04.519]  Let's go ahead and talk to Omar in Michigan.
[01:59:04.579 --> 01:59:05.280]  Omar, go ahead.
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:06.801]  How are you doing today?
[01:59:07.241 --> 01:59:07.561]  Good, sir.
[01:59:07.601 --> 01:59:07.962]  Go ahead.
[01:59:08.402 --> 01:59:12.865]  Mr. Steele, we're having a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:59:13.979 --> 01:59:19.381]  Michigan, do you think that has something to do with Bush and them backing them or something?
[01:59:19.661 --> 01:59:35.185]  And the other question I have for you is do you think the October surprise will be the influx of Mexican immigrants that we've had here to the state, they will be voting for Bush and them and that will turn the tables on the Democrats?
[01:59:35.982 --> 01:59:38.403]  I'll listen to your comments off air.
[01:59:38.543 --> 01:59:42.165]  I would be very concerned if the Ku Klux Klan was making a resurgence.
[01:59:42.205 --> 01:59:49.348]  We do have neo-Nazi skinheads out West and I think that's a real troublesome thing.
[01:59:50.048 --> 01:59:58.632]  As far as the October surprise, historically the Republicans know how to defeat the Democrats in a close election.
[01:59:58.652 --> 01:59:59.612]  They know how to steal it.
[02:00:00.172 --> 02:00:04.254]  So if this next election isn't either dumping a whole bunch of candidates
[02:00:05.675 --> 02:00:17.260]  Or everybody ganging up on the extremist Republicans and saving just a few moderate Republicans, then I think we're going to waste two more years and have two more years of violence and debt and despair.
[02:00:20.242 --> 02:00:21.062]  Please elaborate.
[02:00:22.423 --> 02:00:29.186]  Well, you know, I mean, if I ran my business the way Bush has run in this country, I would have been thrown in jail years ago.
[02:00:30.886 --> 02:00:34.428]  He's got a multi-trillion dollar debt.
[02:00:35.558 --> 02:00:42.366]  Uh, he has, uh, we're going to be paying, uh, for decades for the stuff.
[02:00:42.386 --> 02:00:54.240]  And I gotta tell ya, once you have someone willing to commit suicide, once you have tens of thousands of people willing to commit suicide, there is no, this is an arms race we cannot win.
[02:00:55.172 --> 02:00:56.072]  We'd better make peace.
[02:00:56.132 --> 02:01:00.434]  But the neocons said they wanted to stir up the Muslims, and that's a point I've made.
[02:01:00.454 --> 02:01:01.975]  They wanted to break Iraq in three parts.
[02:01:02.015 --> 02:01:06.897]  They wanted to have sectarian and racial killing going on between the three or four grids.
[02:01:07.357 --> 02:01:12.979]  But now it seems like they've overcooked it, and the black hole they created has gotten a little bit big for them.
[02:01:13.259 --> 02:01:23.463]  Well, I think Paul Bremer is an intelligent man who does well in the drawing rooms of diplomacy, but the two stupidest decisions
[02:01:24.262 --> 02:01:27.624]  That he made the first two decisions basically created the insurgents.
[02:01:27.664 --> 02:01:30.905]  Was to disband the Ba'athist mechanism?
[02:01:31.165 --> 02:01:31.666]  Exactly.
[02:01:31.706 --> 02:01:38.369]  De-Ba'athifying the government gave them their leaders and disbanding the army put hundreds of thousands of pissed off guys with guns in the street.
[02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:42.571]  I mean, Bremer and Cheney and Wolfowitz and Feist.
[02:01:43.251 --> 02:01:45.313]  Are four of the most dangerous people on the planet.
[02:01:45.333 --> 02:01:46.554]  Let's see, let's see.
[02:01:46.614 --> 02:01:47.395]  Look, they're in power.
[02:01:47.415 --> 02:01:48.055]  They're in control.
[02:01:48.095 --> 02:01:49.456]  They're doing what people have never done before.
[02:01:49.737 --> 02:01:50.337]  Taking over.
[02:01:50.657 --> 02:01:52.139]  I don't think that's a screw-up.
[02:01:52.199 --> 02:01:53.360]  I don't think that's dumb.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.941]  I mean, look at that.
[02:01:55.201 --> 02:02:00.826]  Every time they know what their own documents say, they wanted that place to totally melt down.
[02:02:01.207 --> 02:02:02.848]  Well, I won't disagree with you.
[02:02:03.889 --> 02:02:05.730]  If that's what they wanted, they certainly got it.
[02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:10.114]  But I'm not sure... I'm not sure... I think they...
[02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:16.991]  They really did not understand just how ugly this was going to be.
[02:02:17.011 --> 02:02:19.131]  No, I agree.
[02:02:19.211 --> 02:02:24.493]  I think that, well, the Bible says that if you dig a pit for somebody else, you're going to fall in it.
[02:02:24.833 --> 02:02:25.973]  Well, or dig two graves.
[02:02:27.653 --> 02:02:28.013]  Stay there.
[02:02:28.033 --> 02:02:30.254]  We're going to come back and let you and Webster Carpley talk for a segment.
[02:02:30.594 --> 02:02:32.554]  And then, Will, I'll let you get back to your important work, sir.
[02:02:32.874 --> 02:02:35.615]  And a little bit more on 9-11 with both you gentlemen on the other side.
[02:02:35.635 --> 02:02:40.696]  But I've got to have you back up and talk about technology explosion that's happening right now and the information.
[02:02:41.734 --> 02:02:43.395]  It's like a whole new form of life!
[02:02:44.296 --> 02:02:51.881]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.241 --> 02:02:54.163]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.523 --> 02:03:02.068]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.853 --> 02:03:09.918]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.318 --> 02:03:21.705]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.045 --> 02:03:25.528]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.028 --> 02:03:27.949]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.269 --> 02:03:32.112]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.481 --> 02:03:47.342]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:03:47.663 --> 02:03:49.184]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:03:49.604 --> 02:03:49.844]  What?
[02:03:50.205 --> 02:03:50.585]  Again?
[02:03:50.985 --> 02:03:52.626]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:03:52.686 --> 02:03:57.110]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:58.631]  Why did you do that?
[02:03:58.851 --> 02:04:04.655]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:04:04.935 --> 02:04:05.976]  Are we there yet?
[02:04:06.076 --> 02:04:07.157]  for the entire trip.
[02:04:07.377 --> 02:04:09.599]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:04:10.059 --> 02:04:11.080]  Great idea.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:13.922]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:04:14.306 --> 02:04:16.770]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:04:16.971 --> 02:04:21.358]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:04:21.658 --> 02:04:21.959]  Honey!
[02:04:22.785 --> 02:04:24.025]  You're terrific!
[02:04:24.406 --> 02:04:25.886]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:04:26.006 --> 02:04:29.407]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:04:29.708 --> 02:04:30.488]  Now, can we stop?
[02:04:30.988 --> 02:04:31.728]  I need to go, too.
[02:04:32.028 --> 02:04:36.470]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:45.788 --> 02:04:48.110]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:48.370 --> 02:04:50.392]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:50.552 --> 02:04:57.597]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:57.857 --> 02:05:06.444]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:05:46.141 --> 02:05:48.341]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.902 --> 02:05:51.762]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.502 --> 02:06:10.986]  I'd like to, at least once or twice a week, thank all of our AM and FM affiliates, as well as Global Shortwave, WWCR, the Internet, all the folks that make that possible here in my operation, that is from Chicago to Louisiana to Texas to London, England and Sheffield.
[02:06:12.293 --> 02:06:15.694]  And to my whole crew and of course you, the listeners, the sponsors, everybody.
[02:06:15.714 --> 02:06:17.974]  We're going to go to Webster Tarpley here in just about a minute.
[02:06:18.275 --> 02:06:32.198]  I have one last question for you, Mr. Steele, before we bring up Webster Tarpley whose book you said is really the definitive volume on 9-11 inside job and is enough evidence for indictment of Cheney and other co-conspirators.
[02:06:33.348 --> 02:06:48.851]  And that is, you know, I ought to send you this because looking at all the contacts, the generals, the intelligence agencies you work for, you know, the Google people you work with, I mean, you really are an influential person and I'm really impressed now talking to you and I don't normally start with... No, I wouldn't overestimate that.
[02:06:49.071 --> 02:06:52.574]  Well, I'm just saying we're on the same page with what we see happening.
[02:06:53.234 --> 02:06:57.437]  Again, it's just a country bumpkin looking at this who's been living in this and watching how it works.
[02:06:57.537 --> 02:07:00.880]  What we can do is seeing some of the future positives.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.743]  There's also a lot of negatives that Joy and others have discussed and Warwick is pushing.
[02:07:07.632 --> 02:07:16.381]  I am seeing hundreds of message boards, hundreds of postings, where the same posting is being attacking me, is being cemented in, being cut and paste.
[02:07:16.922 --> 02:07:18.863]  I am seeing our information being censored.
[02:07:18.904 --> 02:07:25.510]  We know the White House paid for tens of thousands of fake letters to the editor, paying off reporters, $1.6 billion in fake news.
[02:07:26.011 --> 02:07:26.551]  They admit it.
[02:07:26.571 --> 02:07:28.153]  We know there's a huge effort out there.
[02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:32.392]  And I just, I haven't heard you speak a lot to that.
[02:07:32.412 --> 02:07:49.681]  I'm not sure if you're aware of how widespread sectors of the government, and I guess private agencies or groups they're hiring out, I'm not sure who all is doing it, but I am seeing these trolls on the web trying to just spew it full of background noise and disinfos, and a lot of it's mockingbird.
[02:07:49.701 --> 02:07:57.545]  A lot of people just parrot what one real disinfo person puts out, but I mean, can you just speak, I know I'm just giving you a lot of generality, can you speak to what I'm saying?
[02:07:58.211 --> 02:08:01.033]  Well, I think that there is a clear pattern of the U.S.
[02:08:01.073 --> 02:08:03.355]  government paying for news it can use.
[02:08:05.056 --> 02:08:12.481]  I personally hope that the revolution that Joe Trippi and Howard Dean started picks up some momentum.
[02:08:14.342 --> 02:08:16.924]  In fact, let me give you two websites, or three websites.
[02:08:17.905 --> 02:08:25.790]  www.citizens-party.org just has a few basic documents on how I hope we can all come together
[02:08:26.337 --> 02:08:32.761]  And basically vote out the corrupt and vote in people who will vote for their districts rather than for the party line.
[02:08:33.401 --> 02:08:44.108]  On my own website, www.oss.net provides free public intelligence and free weekly summaries and forecasts of threats and policies.
[02:08:44.668 --> 02:08:45.789]  And lastly, Amazon.
[02:08:45.869 --> 02:08:47.430]  Amazon is a national treasure.
[02:08:48.090 --> 02:08:51.973]  And I certainly commend anyone spending a little time on Amazon.
[02:08:52.013 --> 02:08:55.415]  And if you see any one of my reviews, like for instance, my Tarpley review,
[02:08:55.962 --> 02:09:03.316]  If you click on that and bookmark it, you'll have all my other book reviews, and that's the equivalent of a free graduate education in International Affairs.
[02:09:09.338 --> 02:09:13.080]  You know that you're saying here that we have to get involved.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.841]  We have to interface with the information.
[02:09:14.881 --> 02:09:15.722]  We have to get involved.
[02:09:15.742 --> 02:09:17.062]  And people think it's boring.
[02:09:17.122 --> 02:09:18.243]  It's horrible to read.
[02:09:18.283 --> 02:09:19.604]  It's horrible to analyze.
[02:09:19.644 --> 02:09:21.085]  It's horrible to get informed.
[02:09:21.125 --> 02:09:21.825]  That's not true.
[02:09:22.325 --> 02:09:24.106]  It makes you live longer, the studies show.
[02:09:24.186 --> 02:09:28.249]  It makes you retain more neuron connectivity throughout age.
[02:09:28.849 --> 02:09:30.129]  Well, all we can do is try.
[02:09:58.416 --> 02:09:59.296]  Well, we are doing that.
[02:09:59.856 --> 02:10:02.057]  Let's go ahead and go to Webster Tarpley.
[02:10:02.397 --> 02:10:08.078]  Again, Webster, good to have you on, and now you're on with Mr. Steele, who gave you that glowing review.
[02:10:08.458 --> 02:10:09.098]  Yes, thank you.
[02:10:09.318 --> 02:10:10.538]  Thank you, Alex, very much.
[02:10:10.578 --> 02:10:15.099]  And I've never met Mr. Steele, but the first thing I have to do is thank him for that very kind review.
[02:10:15.119 --> 02:10:25.942]  He's been very generous, and I'm sure more than I deserve, but he's also very authoritative, and when he tells people that a book is good, they respond.
[02:10:26.122 --> 02:10:27.582]  My book has gone up to about
[02:10:28.982 --> 02:10:42.574]  250 on the Amazon rankings from being in the thousands, and I really don't know whether any 9-11 book of the critical type, the anti-government, anti-regime type that I represent has ever gotten quite that high.
[02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:46.257]  So my hat goes off to him, and I have nothing but gratitude.
[02:10:46.998 --> 02:10:49.981]  Actually, yeah, Rubicon got something in the top 80.
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.641]  Well, that could be.
[02:10:52.861 --> 02:10:54.342]  I've just had no way of knowing.
[02:10:54.362 --> 02:10:56.684]  Probably, too, though, a lot of it was Steele's review.
[02:10:57.064 --> 02:11:02.508]  Well, I think the progressive publisher also did some good work with advertising the book.
[02:11:02.548 --> 02:11:04.209]  You certainly owe them a thank you.
[02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:06.550]  But, no, I was glad to review your book.
[02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:08.211]  I take your book very seriously.
[02:11:09.252 --> 02:11:16.257]  I can't say that I would use your book to execute somebody, but I would certainly use your book at the beginning of an investigation.
[02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:17.956]  A proper investigation.
[02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:19.457]  And I think that's the idea.
[02:11:19.577 --> 02:11:21.078]  It is a political thesis.
[02:11:21.178 --> 02:11:24.159]  It is not, in any way, designed to be a court document.
[02:11:24.319 --> 02:11:24.499]  Right.
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:28.382]  A political judgment is the overarching framework for everything else.
[02:11:28.962 --> 02:11:32.064]  And as soon as the lawyers come in, then everything changes.
[02:11:32.144 --> 02:11:37.647]  And it's important to make the overarching truth, which again, for me, is my hop.
[02:11:37.707 --> 02:11:39.728]  That is the made it happen on purpose.
[02:11:39.788 --> 02:11:44.251]  The notion that these attacks did not come from any organization
[02:11:44.861 --> 02:11:55.230]  Based in the Middle East, primarily made up of Arabs or Muslims or Bin Laden sitting in some cave or any of this, but rather from the bowels of the U.S.
[02:11:55.271 --> 02:12:01.476]  intelligence community, the Pentagon, the Wall Street banking establishment, and therefore made in USA.
[02:12:01.857 --> 02:12:05.500]  And I think this is really important because if we don't get to that,
[02:12:05.936 --> 02:12:17.544]  We're always going to believe that this demagogy that we see now, the desperate Republican demagogues of the Bush camp, are attempting to freshen up fear.
[02:12:17.684 --> 02:12:26.870]  Their entire neo-fascist galaxy orbits around the false flag terror-fear paradigm.
[02:12:26.890 --> 02:12:29.051]  9-11 is the pillar of their church, right?
[02:12:29.091 --> 02:12:31.973]  You are 9-11, and on this rock I will build my
[02:12:32.458 --> 02:12:37.021]  Pagan church, with this as a synthetic civic religion.
[02:12:37.462 --> 02:12:41.565]  And of course, it's not just Bush, it's also Hillary Clinton.
[02:12:41.605 --> 02:12:46.728]  She's there to tell you, well, there is a need for a war on terror, but Bush just doesn't do it right.
[02:12:47.169 --> 02:12:54.074]  Elect Hillary Clinton, elect Rahm Emanuel, and these people, and we'll have the right war on terror.
[02:12:54.114 --> 02:12:56.796]  And final thing is, the question of the drills.
[02:12:56.916 --> 02:13:01.359]  That is, that these attacks are mediated, bootlegged in, under the cover of drills.
[02:13:01.883 --> 02:13:10.506]  It shows us that where we have to look for the next attack is on the list of military operations, terror drills, and so forth.
[02:13:10.666 --> 02:13:11.086]  Exactly.
[02:13:11.146 --> 02:13:16.968]  It's a little black cloud, an otherwise clear sky, that always appears right at the same time.
[02:13:17.488 --> 02:13:19.488]  And again, Oklahoma City, running a drill.
[02:13:19.528 --> 02:13:22.249]  BATF, the first World Trade Center attack.
[02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:23.649]  FBI, running a drill.
[02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:35.324]  Of course on New York 9-11 running tripod 2 drills moving the main command base of the city and the county and the feds out of building 7 out to the pier for a terror attack.
[02:13:36.245 --> 02:13:40.491]  All the other drills of hijacked jets being flown to buildings at the same time to confuse
[02:13:41.366 --> 02:13:43.927]  Norad and the FAA and the Interceptors.
[02:13:44.187 --> 02:13:59.190]  And we saw a drill being hired by the former head of Scotland Yard Public Relations, Peter Power, telling BBC News Radio 5 and ITN Television that he ran exact drills, exact place, exact time of the exact same thing happening.
[02:13:59.510 --> 02:14:06.431]  And Mr. Steele, can you speak to the bootlegging of False Flag Terror to Smokescreen in case any agents get caught?
[02:14:06.451 --> 02:14:07.351]  They say it's a drill.
[02:14:07.591 --> 02:14:09.652]  They also bootlegged the funding through it.
[02:14:09.672 --> 02:14:10.332]  Can you speak to that?
[02:14:11.104 --> 02:14:16.948]  Well, there's no question but that the Pakistani President is under an enormous amount of pressure.
[02:14:17.188 --> 02:14:18.869]  I mean, he's sitting on a powder keg.
[02:14:20.590 --> 02:14:23.472]  I believe that he needed something.
[02:14:25.153 --> 02:14:37.821]  And I believe that Mr. Tarkin is probably right that this may have been intended to be a nuclear attack, that is to say an airplane going into a nuclear plant, and they backed off from that possibly as a negotiated compromise.
[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:41.262]  Between the White House and the Pakistani Intelligence Service.
[02:14:41.742 --> 02:14:48.666]  But the bottom line here is there is enough information out there to persuade me that our government has not been honest.
[02:14:48.766 --> 02:14:59.512]  And I don't know if you've noticed this, Bill, but I've got you speaking in January with Michael Hiem, who wrote the book, Who the Hell Are We Fighting?, in which he talks about the way the U.S.
[02:14:59.552 --> 02:15:03.133]  government lied to the people about numbers in Vietnam.
[02:15:03.594 --> 02:15:07.696]  And I also have Thomas Naylor from the Vermont Republic Secessionist Movement.
[02:15:08.237 --> 02:15:11.720]  And all three of you are centered on, can we trust our government?
[02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:13.441]  But I think the answer is no right now.
[02:15:14.602 --> 02:15:15.262]  Certainly not.
[02:15:15.603 --> 02:15:26.271]  The only thing I would say is, if we look at Pakistan and the inter-services intelligence, these are people who may have some voice in terms of what happens in the northern Pakistani tribal zones.
[02:15:26.751 --> 02:15:31.294]  Concerning what happens in the skies over New York, they count for absolutely nothing.
[02:15:31.695 --> 02:15:34.557]  They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the CIA,
[02:15:35.322 --> 02:15:43.406]  MI6, they always have been, and anyone of them who doesn't like that is going to find his body riddled with bullets and floating in a canal somewhere.
[02:15:43.706 --> 02:15:54.532]  So I don't accept myself the notion that the Saudi government or the Pakistani regime has any role in determining the timing of this, or that there's anything to negotiate with them.
[02:15:54.572 --> 02:15:56.533]  I just don't see that in any sense.
[02:15:56.653 --> 02:16:00.395]  This is an impulse coming from Wall Street, from the City of London,
[02:16:00.848 --> 02:16:02.869]  It's mediated through this invisible government.
[02:16:02.889 --> 02:16:10.132]  But there is a major role in finance in these molds tied into Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, at least with the backstory.
[02:16:10.292 --> 02:16:17.376]  Well, crossing the Rubicon has some of the detailed information on the Safari Club and some of these other things.
[02:16:17.496 --> 02:16:23.459]  Buzzy Krongard, certainly in my mind, he took a dollar a year job for a very good reason at CIA.
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:30.182]  And certainly you can say that the ISI is important as something that
[02:16:30.797 --> 02:16:31.118]  I think?
[02:16:47.645 --> 02:16:48.045]  J.P.
[02:16:48.085 --> 02:16:51.066]  Morgan, it's been with us now for more than a hundred years.
[02:16:51.126 --> 02:16:52.446]  And Webster, we're going to talk more about that.
[02:16:52.466 --> 02:16:53.127]  This is where it comes from.
[02:16:53.307 --> 02:16:54.587]  We're going to talk more about that after the break.
[02:16:54.607 --> 02:16:59.929]  Mr. Steele is now going to leave us, and you can check out his website by linking through at InfoWars.com.
[02:16:59.969 --> 02:17:02.549]  We have links to it right now up there.
[02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:04.870]  I look forward to having you back on in the future.
[02:17:04.890 --> 02:17:08.671]  I'm going to send you Terror Storm, and I would love to get a review from you, my friend.
[02:17:09.292 --> 02:17:15.874]  Can you just, in the last 30 seconds, do you think the elite is scared right now with the information revolution and the sleeping giant awakening?
[02:17:16.274 --> 02:17:17.294]  The short answer is no.
[02:17:18.572 --> 02:17:22.115]  They're counting on the American people being apathetic through this next election.
[02:17:22.375 --> 02:17:24.237]  Do you think that humorous is going to backfire?
[02:17:25.558 --> 02:17:26.098]  I hope so.
[02:17:28.139 --> 02:17:28.780]  I tend to agree.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.721]  I think a lot of their analysts are concerned.
[02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:35.205]  But I think at the top, they're just... Do you think it's a question of humorous?
[02:17:35.265 --> 02:17:39.287]  You know, I mean, these guys have their own world view.
[02:17:39.628 --> 02:17:41.949]  And in their world view, we're stupid.
[02:17:41.969 --> 02:17:42.730]  Hold on one moment.
[02:17:45.615 --> 02:17:46.055]  Gold.
[02:17:46.416 --> 02:17:47.697]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:17:47.957 --> 02:17:54.023]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:17:54.223 --> 02:17:58.047]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:17:58.407 --> 02:18:00.289]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:02.631]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:02.771 --> 02:18:09.558]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:18:09.718 --> 02:18:11.019]  We're good to go.
[02:18:24.735 --> 02:18:31.262]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[02:18:51.678 --> 02:18:57.860]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:19:48.685 --> 02:19:55.830]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the Communist world in the last days?
[02:19:56.650 --> 02:20:02.274]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the Western world of Christianity?
[02:20:02.714 --> 02:20:03.154]  I think so.
[02:20:17.535 --> 02:20:19.337]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:19.477 --> 02:20:20.177]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:44.958 --> 02:20:50.902]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:01.041]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:21:23.507 --> 02:21:23.867]  I think so.
[02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:57.291]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:21:57.331 --> 02:21:57.871]  until 2 p.m.
[02:21:57.891 --> 02:21:58.772]  Central Standard Time.
[02:21:58.792 --> 02:22:00.613]  We're back from 9 to midnight.
[02:22:01.073 --> 02:22:02.493]  Central Standard Time.
[02:22:04.774 --> 02:22:07.395]  We are finishing up with Robert Steele.
[02:22:07.415 --> 02:22:08.916]  I'm going to let him go now.
[02:22:09.136 --> 02:22:11.337]  But sir, I wanted you to plug your free intelligence report.
[02:22:11.357 --> 02:22:13.617]  You know, I think the key to this is free.
[02:22:14.438 --> 02:22:15.598]  And it's an open source.
[02:22:15.618 --> 02:22:19.820]  Like when I make a new film, make it cost me $100,000, I put it out for free on Google Video.
[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:22.601]  Because the goal is to get the information out and then
[02:22:23.513 --> 02:22:27.937]  Hopefully enough people will then support it and buy the DVD for us to support ourselves.
[02:22:28.537 --> 02:22:32.120]  How do you support yourself when you do your big intelligence report every week for free?
[02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:36.864]  Well, I have a couple of contracts and I run an international conference.
[02:22:37.425 --> 02:22:45.992]  But if people go to OSS.net, they'll find these public daily intelligence reports completely free on the left-hand side.
[02:22:46.632 --> 02:22:50.655]  And they'll also find the conference information on the right-hand side.
[02:22:50.675 --> 02:22:52.417]  And I'm looking to have an interesting mix of
[02:22:53.240 --> 02:23:05.523]  250 international people this year and we're looking at the 10 threats to humanity and we're looking at the whole idea of collective intelligence and belief systems that threaten our belief system.
[02:23:06.491 --> 02:23:15.037]  Absolutely, and there is a predatory, social-Darwinistic, Malthusian driver behind this let-them-eat-cake, very decadent elite.
[02:23:15.458 --> 02:23:17.980]  It's kind of like a deep diver gets narcosis.
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:20.141]  Well, it's the same thing in high places.
[02:23:20.181 --> 02:23:23.243]  They get delusional, and it's very, very dangerous.
[02:23:24.384 --> 02:23:29.308]  And can't people also vote for your reviews to drive them up Amazon so more people see the books you're reviewing?
[02:23:29.568 --> 02:23:32.889]  Well, I can't solicit that, but I'd be very glad if they did.
[02:23:32.909 --> 02:23:37.570]  I mean, if my reviews are worth your attention, of course I'd be honored to have your vote.
[02:23:37.871 --> 02:23:38.871]  Well, folks, you should go do that.
[02:23:38.911 --> 02:23:44.573]  It's a way to get good books to have attention, instead of some stupid book about Madonna crucifying herself.
[02:23:44.873 --> 02:23:45.873]  Okay, good to talk to you.
[02:23:45.893 --> 02:23:47.514]  Look forward to speaking with you again soon, sir.
[02:23:47.814 --> 02:23:48.034]  All right.
[02:23:48.094 --> 02:23:48.894]  Bye and bye, Bill.
[02:23:49.594 --> 02:23:50.014]  Take care.
[02:23:50.975 --> 02:23:53.475]  Let's go back to Mr. Tarpley.
[02:23:55.056 --> 02:23:56.816]  Alex, let me just mention one thing.
[02:23:56.856 --> 02:23:58.677]  He was talking about his free website.
[02:23:59.387 --> 02:24:02.670]  I have a free website too, and I have a birthday here coming up.
[02:24:03.090 --> 02:24:10.697]  Tomorrow marks the 10th anniversary on the internet of Tarpley.net, or in a slightly different form, but basically that.
[02:24:11.057 --> 02:24:15.801]  And above all, having this unauthorized biography of George Bush available for free.
[02:24:16.162 --> 02:24:25.830]  And that went up on, looks like it went up on October 26th, 1996, just a week or so before the presidential election of that year.
[02:24:26.365 --> 02:24:27.426]  And it's been up ever since.
[02:24:27.506 --> 02:24:32.511]  And I think it's the oldest continuous anti-Bush site of Bush dynasty now that there is.
[02:24:32.991 --> 02:24:34.513]  And I would recommend that people go to it.
[02:24:34.533 --> 02:24:40.899]  You can go and find all the stuff about Prescott Bush financing the rise of Hitler, John Hinckley and Neil Bush.
[02:24:41.259 --> 02:24:43.902]  Are you aware that there's also a PDF of your new book?
[02:24:45.261 --> 02:24:46.041]  I'm not sure.
[02:24:46.061 --> 02:24:47.802]  I saw it last night.
[02:24:47.822 --> 02:24:50.962]  I would just tell people for a while it's important to buy the books.
[02:24:51.002 --> 02:24:54.763]  You can continue to, you know, I mean, get off beans and crackers.
[02:24:54.943 --> 02:24:58.144]  But the one I wanted to mention is my chapter on Omaha.
[02:24:58.224 --> 02:24:59.745]  It's a relatively short chapter.
[02:25:00.165 --> 02:25:12.227]  I do go into the Omaha pedophile ring, the Craig Spence ring, these underage homosexual gigolos in the Bush White House back in 1989, getting on the front page of the Washington Times.
[02:25:12.287 --> 02:25:14.248]  And I think this is very relevant now to the
[02:25:14.758 --> 02:25:43.944]  The existence of this semi-secret homosexual cabal in the House of Representatives that seems to be running things, and Speaker Hastert, again widely reported by Wayne Manson and others, as being a practicing homosexual, living with his lover in a townhouse on Capitol Hill, and the entire apparatus around that, which has been around for decades and decades, I would probably trace it back to Theodore Roosevelt and the origins of modern liberal republicanism.
[02:25:44.386 --> 02:25:51.050]  But I think this is a very important topic, and again, I don't do it out of any particular... No, no, it's true.
[02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:54.873]  Listen, I've been doing this for a long time, too, and it just keeps popping up.
[02:25:54.933 --> 02:25:55.533]  It's real.
[02:25:55.933 --> 02:26:05.339]  We have a pervert guild running Washington, not just Republicans, but it's a higher percentage of Republicans, and it's not enough for them to have boyfriends.
[02:26:05.399 --> 02:26:06.540]  They've got to have underage.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:12.983]  And a lot of them are into that, and it's just totally evil, and they're turning the world into their sick playground.
[02:26:13.203 --> 02:26:27.551]  And if you had a secret cabal of vegetarians or bird watchers or pinnacle players controlling the House of Representatives, the public would have a right to know that, and in this case, they unite around these questionable tastes that we've
[02:26:28.702 --> 02:26:34.726]  Well, it's one thing if somebody wants to pose as a family man living with his staff member.
[02:26:35.566 --> 02:26:40.250]  You know, that's pretty bad, but I mean, a lot of them are... I mean, come on, man.
[02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:43.212]  These people, it gets so sick, I don't even want to talk about it.
[02:26:43.292 --> 02:26:51.738]  It's a tremendous market of dupes, I think, where well-meaning voters have their votes convoyed into something that they would not approve of.
[02:26:51.818 --> 02:26:56.982]  Anyway, this, I think, is simply important for people to know, and if you want to go on the website there and look at this
[02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:58.643]  The book is always for free.
[02:26:58.663 --> 02:27:03.629]  You can download the Omaha chapter and I think that's a good preface to the things that you find coming up.
[02:27:04.062 --> 02:27:06.243]  With Wayne Mattson and other people these days.
[02:27:36.046 --> 02:27:39.053]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.975 --> 02:27:42.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.341 --> 02:27:52.763]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:53.203 --> 02:27:57.945]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:58.325 --> 02:28:00.946]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:01.447 --> 02:28:04.848]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:05.628 --> 02:28:09.950]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:10.390 --> 02:28:13.572]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:14.172 --> 02:28:17.013]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:19.929]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:51.735]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:51.975 --> 02:29:53.736]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:53.996 --> 02:30:00.282]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:30:00.582 --> 02:30:06.707]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.947 --> 02:30:08.729]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:08.729 --> 02:30:09.369]  We're good to go.
[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:32.581]  Eliminate the cause.

[02:30:35.203 --> 02:30:35.623]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:35.643 --> 02:30:35.703]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:07.285 --> 02:31:08.986]  Oh yeah.
[02:31:09.266 --> 02:31:11.167]  Come from the land of the ice and snow.
[02:31:11.667 --> 02:31:13.268]  I love that song.
[02:31:14.949 --> 02:31:16.770]  To fight the hordes!
[02:31:19.392 --> 02:31:21.333]  Valhalla, we are coming!
[02:31:22.673 --> 02:31:27.976]  Alright folks, let's uh... Go back to Webster Tarpley, I apologize.
[02:31:28.036 --> 02:31:31.118]  I started playing that song, I can't help but sing along there.
[02:31:31.838 --> 02:31:34.920]  Karaoke with Alex Jones, the ultimate in torture.
[02:31:35.726 --> 02:31:37.027]  It's why you tune in.
[02:31:38.128 --> 02:31:42.551]  Clubster Tarpley, good friend of mine, a person I really respect, really great astute researcher.
[02:31:42.571 --> 02:31:48.196]  Again, I hadn't read his book, Synthetic Terror, and it's exactly what I was saying on air, the exact connections I was making.
[02:31:48.856 --> 02:31:53.560]  And when you talk to people who've done real research, have real political minds, geopolitical strategy,
[02:31:55.385 --> 02:31:57.067]  And then you've got that same understanding.
[02:31:57.207 --> 02:32:01.672]  You go read their book and it's like, my gosh, I wish I had the energy and the time to write this because this is what I would write.
[02:32:02.133 --> 02:32:03.114]  This is how they get it.
[02:32:03.174 --> 02:32:04.175]  This is how they operate.
[02:32:04.395 --> 02:32:05.917]  This is all the frequently asked questions.
[02:32:05.937 --> 02:32:06.758]  People get confused.
[02:32:06.958 --> 02:32:08.299]  They don't understand cloak and dagger.
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:10.702]  We carry it at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:11.964 --> 02:32:16.669]  And we've got a lot of combo deals where you can get Tarpley's new book and my new film Terror Squad together for huge discounts.

[02:32:22.634 --> 02:32:24.895]  That new film has just gone crazy.
[02:32:24.915 --> 02:32:25.635]  It is so good.
[02:32:25.995 --> 02:32:27.035]  Target Federal Reserve.
[02:32:27.075 --> 02:32:27.755]  Target IRS.
[02:32:27.815 --> 02:32:29.016]  Target North American Union.
[02:32:29.476 --> 02:32:30.256]  Microchipping.

[02:32:39.199 --> 02:32:39.519]  Get them.
[02:32:39.539 --> 02:32:40.080]  Make copies.
[02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:41.020]  Go wild!
[02:32:41.792 --> 02:32:42.973]  Go absolutely crazy.

[02:32:48.715 --> 02:32:54.578]  And let's say you already know all about the New World Order.
[02:32:54.618 --> 02:32:55.318]  You know all this stuff.
[02:32:55.338 --> 02:32:55.999]  You've seen the films.
[02:32:56.039 --> 02:32:56.479]  Read the books.
[02:32:56.819 --> 02:32:58.140]  You were in intelligence yourself.
[02:32:58.160 --> 02:32:58.840]  You're a cop.
[02:32:58.860 --> 02:32:59.720]  You know how the world works.
[02:33:00.321 --> 02:33:00.981]  Your neighbor doesn't.
[02:33:01.001 --> 02:33:01.761]  Your grandma doesn't.
[02:33:01.781 --> 02:33:02.162]  Your son.
[02:33:02.202 --> 02:33:02.642]  Your daughter.
[02:33:02.702 --> 02:33:03.562]  Your wife doesn't know.
[02:33:03.582 --> 02:33:04.523]  Your husband doesn't know.
[02:33:05.103 --> 02:33:06.404]  The police chief doesn't know.
[02:33:06.424 --> 02:33:07.644]  Your county commissioner doesn't know.
[02:33:07.684 --> 02:33:08.204]  Your pastor.
[02:33:08.244 --> 02:33:08.765]  Your rabbi.
[02:33:08.785 --> 02:33:09.325]  Your imam.
[02:33:10.899 --> 02:33:11.660]  They don't know.
[02:33:11.861 --> 02:33:14.064]  Well, you need to be an information beacon.
[02:33:14.104 --> 02:33:22.858]  You need to be a transmitter, a telemphysite blood cell, a white blood cell out there defeating the infection in the body politic that is grave.
[02:33:23.339 --> 02:33:26.023]  So please go to infowars.com and please order
[02:33:26.863 --> 02:33:30.307]  Tarpley's book, 9-11 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA, 3rd edition.
[02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:31.188]  Please get Terror Storm.
[02:33:31.228 --> 02:33:36.775]  Please get all the other books and videos that we now carry, like the Blockbuster, and people are going nuts with this film.
[02:33:36.795 --> 02:33:37.976]  I'm so excited about it.
[02:33:38.537 --> 02:33:40.179]  Please get your copy today.
[02:33:40.299 --> 02:33:42.522]  Get multiple copies of America, Freedom from Fascism.
[02:33:43.763 --> 02:33:45.303]  Webster, just give us a preview.
[02:33:45.323 --> 02:33:46.564]  I want to go through five calls right now.
[02:33:46.644 --> 02:33:56.686]  Preview some of the stuff you want to talk about before the show ends concerning the election, concerning the war fleet, three task force groups, two carriers, one loitering nearby, and another task force.
[02:33:56.706 --> 02:33:58.306]  So really, four in the area.
[02:33:59.807 --> 02:34:01.287]  Just give us a thumbnail of what's coming up.
[02:34:01.327 --> 02:34:02.547]  We're going to blast through some calls.
[02:34:02.567 --> 02:34:05.508]  I've got somebody who disagrees with me named Cecil I want to go to first.
[02:34:05.973 --> 02:34:06.213]  Great.
[02:34:06.293 --> 02:34:07.254]  I would say the following.
[02:34:07.734 --> 02:34:11.717]  The New York Times CBS poll, I think, is the starting point.
[02:34:11.737 --> 02:34:19.242]  16% of the American population still believe in the 9-11 terror myth, but 84% do not, to a greater or lesser extent.
[02:34:19.282 --> 02:34:25.106]  And again, you have contributed a lot to that, and the 9-11 truth movement, I think, has scored a decisive victory with that.
[02:34:25.526 --> 02:34:27.968]  Now, that has to be the prelude to a defeat of Bush.
[02:34:28.488 --> 02:34:33.552]  It means that the spell, this terror brainwash that he's tried to do,
[02:34:34.085 --> 02:34:40.770]  Is wearing thin, and that has now got to be translated into a colossal landslide defeat for the pro-Bush party.
[02:34:40.810 --> 02:34:47.555]  It's got to lead to a massive repudiation of Bush, his war, and above all the 9-11 myth at the polls.
[02:34:47.975 --> 02:34:58.202]  A defeat so big that it'll go beyond just Iraq, important as that is, and get into this whole question of the global war on terror, which is the big fraud that covers everything else.
[02:34:59.263 --> 02:35:03.046]  If people have 9-11 truth candidates to vote for, obviously they should
[02:35:03.447 --> 02:35:04.148]  They should do that.
[02:35:04.208 --> 02:35:12.674]  They should vote for the Bob Bowmans and the Craig Hills in Vermont, and the Carol Boulais in the Bay Area, or the Matthew Woodsons in Oklahoma.
[02:35:13.174 --> 02:35:23.602]  If you don't have that, you can find people running for Congress, like Congressman Kucinich or Congressman Ron Paul, people who are clearly profiled in an anti-Bush, anti-totalitarian mode.
[02:35:24.222 --> 02:35:26.844]  And other than that, vote against the ruling party.
[02:35:26.864 --> 02:35:28.686]  And I think the interesting thing is the following.
[02:35:29.707 --> 02:35:32.949]  This regime has never had congressional oversight
[02:35:33.513 --> 02:35:33.833]  We're good.
[02:35:54.656 --> 02:35:56.397]  And that's the classic subpoena, right?
[02:35:56.437 --> 02:35:57.238]  Do just take them.
[02:35:57.498 --> 02:35:59.539]  You show up, and you bring these documents.
[02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:02.201]  What did George Bush know, and when did he know it?
[02:36:02.361 --> 02:36:03.102]  Let's go to calls.
[02:36:03.642 --> 02:36:05.424]  Let's talk to Cecil in Nevada.
[02:36:05.464 --> 02:36:06.805]  Cecil, thank you for holding.
[02:36:07.185 --> 02:36:07.745]  Go ahead.
[02:36:07.765 --> 02:36:09.086]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:09.126 --> 02:36:10.267]  Thanks so much for having me on.
[02:36:10.287 --> 02:36:11.028]  I really appreciate it.
[02:36:11.048 --> 02:36:12.689]  I've been trying to get here for a couple of weeks.
[02:36:12.749 --> 02:36:14.170]  I'll make this as quick as I can.
[02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:19.954]  I want to preface my disagreement with you with I think the work that you're doing is very important.
[02:36:20.749 --> 02:36:23.210]  Well, I appreciate that, but you don't have to preface it.
[02:36:23.230 --> 02:36:24.411]  I mean, I am wrong sometimes.
[02:36:24.471 --> 02:36:25.151]  I need help.
[02:36:25.171 --> 02:36:27.032]  Well, this is a very sore spot with you.
[02:36:27.072 --> 02:36:41.937]  I've heard you talk about it a number of times, and I just want you to know that even though I take the position that I do, I still promote you, your Terror Storm, your programming, and so forth and so on.
[02:36:42.037 --> 02:36:43.458]  I recognize it for the truth.
[02:36:44.182 --> 02:36:45.563]  And I appreciate Mr. Tarpley.
[02:36:45.583 --> 02:36:48.565]  Let me guess, as Christians, we shouldn't fight evil, or is it something like that?
[02:36:48.746 --> 02:36:49.426]  That's the one.
[02:36:49.486 --> 02:36:49.987]  You got it.
[02:36:50.387 --> 02:36:50.807]  You know it.
[02:36:50.947 --> 02:36:51.768]  You knew it was coming.
[02:36:52.228 --> 02:36:58.813]  And what I'd like to see you do, Mr. Jones, if you would, there's a gentleman by the name of William P. Grady.
[02:36:58.833 --> 02:37:10.142]  I don't know whether you're familiar with him or not, but I would like to see if you couldn't get him on the show and kind of hash this thing out, because he pretty much has the position that you do, with the exception of
[02:37:10.834 --> 02:37:13.375]  Just not being able to turn this thing around.
[02:37:13.715 --> 02:37:14.936]  And I agree with him.
[02:37:15.036 --> 02:37:18.577]  I agree with you that work you do is important and I don't think it should stop.
[02:37:18.617 --> 02:37:19.838]  I think we should know the truth.
[02:37:20.158 --> 02:37:22.138]  But I don't think it's going to get turned around.
[02:37:22.158 --> 02:37:29.461]  I think it's important for the people to... Well listen, regardless of that, we need to wake people up so they're not part of this evil system so they don't get hurt by it.
[02:37:29.661 --> 02:37:30.062]  I agree.
[02:37:30.342 --> 02:37:36.304]  And, you know, I mean the whole Bible is about people getting killed or imprisoned for standing up against evil government.
[02:37:36.744 --> 02:37:38.105]  So you're saying you disagree with me?
[02:37:38.145 --> 02:37:38.805]  I mean, what's the...
[02:37:39.777 --> 02:37:43.981]  I disagree with you in the fact that this can be turned around.
[02:37:45.822 --> 02:37:48.605]  Let's say this, Nineveh was given a hundred year reprieve.
[02:37:49.485 --> 02:37:50.386]  You've got that right.
[02:37:51.507 --> 02:37:53.028]  Jonah paid for doing that.
[02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:58.893]  I understand that, but I'd like to see you have Grady on and just talk about that.
[02:37:58.953 --> 02:38:00.835]  I think he would probably come on your program.
[02:38:01.517 --> 02:38:05.261]  And just talk about the differences that you have in that.
[02:38:05.301 --> 02:38:06.502]  Many of the people that I am with however,
[02:38:21.119 --> 02:38:30.843]  That I associate with are under that impression, and of course they think I'm a nutcase, a fruitcake, but... Well listen, listen, I gotta jump, but I appreciate your call, and I'm sorry you had trouble getting through.
[02:38:30.863 --> 02:38:31.983]  I want to go to more calls.
[02:38:32.023 --> 02:38:43.648]  Webster, you've got the Christian Church that was the backbone of the war against the British in 1776, that was the backbone against slavery, that's been the backbone of so many great movements, suffrage in this country,
[02:38:44.404 --> 02:38:46.405]  Now co-opted into different camps.
[02:38:46.565 --> 02:38:47.866]  One of them is bush worship.
[02:38:47.886 --> 02:38:50.447]  He literally has been likened to Jesus.
[02:38:50.487 --> 02:38:54.649]  He is now worshipped as a living demigod saint.
[02:38:55.909 --> 02:38:58.390]  Absolute pagan blasphemy, of course.
[02:38:58.530 --> 02:38:59.031]  Yeah, it is.
[02:38:59.211 --> 02:39:00.211]  But then there's other groups.
[02:39:00.531 --> 02:39:05.233]  There's those that say he's the devil's henchman, but we shouldn't fight evil, we should lay down.
[02:39:05.253 --> 02:39:08.855]  And then there's those that are just totally punched out and aren't even involved.
[02:39:08.875 --> 02:39:11.316]  And there are Christians fighting evil, the biggest group in the country.
[02:39:11.336 --> 02:39:12.997]  I mean, can you comment to that?
[02:39:13.593 --> 02:39:19.137]  I would say this is the danger of taking one line of scripture and trying to turn it against the entire corpus.
[02:39:19.517 --> 02:39:24.361]  It's why you need to read things in a way that is other than literal or fundamental.
[02:39:24.381 --> 02:39:25.422]  You've got to look at the whole body.
[02:39:25.722 --> 02:39:31.986]  The whole issue of Christianity is a resistance movement against the horrors of the collapsing Roman Empire.
[02:39:32.527 --> 02:39:39.732]  And I think if you look at David Ray Griffin's recent book on the subject, he's got a whole part about the US as a demonic power
[02:39:40.208 --> 02:39:47.032]  And how Christianity, if it's going to be faithful to its origins, has got to resist this kind of imperialism.
[02:39:47.052 --> 02:40:04.482]  In other words, the notion of an empire reduces people to cattle, and it violates the commandment of love your neighbor, and the famous commandments about feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, housing the homeless, visiting the sick, visiting prisoners, burying the dead, in other words, charity.
[02:40:05.366 --> 02:40:08.227]  It's a violation of charity up and down the line.
[02:40:08.307 --> 02:40:11.468]  You're also standing before the king and saying you're a piece of filth.
[02:40:12.008 --> 02:40:14.949]  I mean, that's part of it, too.
[02:40:15.109 --> 02:40:16.310]  You've got to resist evil.
[02:40:16.530 --> 02:40:18.670]  You've got to resist evil in an intelligent way.
[02:40:19.691 --> 02:40:21.211]  I think there's no doubt about it.
[02:40:21.231 --> 02:40:26.253]  I think, again, David Ray Griffin is a pretty good theologian, and I think he makes that argument in a convincing way.
[02:40:27.473 --> 02:40:29.614]  Let's talk to Darrell in Montana.
[02:40:29.634 --> 02:40:30.234]  You're on the air.
[02:40:30.274 --> 02:40:30.954]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:40:30.974 --> 02:40:32.055]  Hey, Alex.
[02:40:32.435 --> 02:40:32.655]  Hi.
[02:40:33.266 --> 02:40:39.710]  Hey, I kind of come from a whole different premise, but I've been trying to get in for a couple days and I didn't want to interrupt your guest.
[02:40:39.890 --> 02:40:40.870]  Hey, we're all over the map.
[02:40:40.890 --> 02:40:41.691]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:40:42.611 --> 02:40:54.678]  Basically, the problem with society as a whole, they forget that evil, besides being manifested in the physical form, all exists in other levels of consciousness as well.
[02:40:54.878 --> 02:40:59.521]  And part of the problem with society today is we seem to forget that.
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:06.622]  Everyone wants to fight it in the physical, but it's the underlying... Well, I'll say this.
[02:41:07.242 --> 02:41:08.583]  We fight evil, it starts at home.
[02:41:08.643 --> 02:41:09.523]  Charity starts at home.
[02:41:09.923 --> 02:41:14.084]  Not fighting with your wife, not being greedy, not being petty, not being insecure.
[02:41:14.104 --> 02:41:15.725]  Yeah, I mean, I agree.
[02:41:16.145 --> 02:41:18.106]  It starts inside your chest.
[02:41:18.286 --> 02:41:22.047]  And when you went to Bohemian Grove, did you feel the evil from the statue?
[02:41:23.702 --> 02:41:24.442]  Oh, that whole place?
[02:41:24.802 --> 02:41:25.402]  Old men?
[02:41:25.422 --> 02:41:29.623]  I mean, people can watch that footage and say, oh, it's just a bunch of old men dressed up in red and black rubs.
[02:41:30.023 --> 02:41:30.884]  I mean, let me just comment.
[02:41:31.204 --> 02:41:33.744]  Red and black rubs acting, you know, like a bunch of idiots getting drunk.
[02:41:34.224 --> 02:41:34.724]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:41:34.844 --> 02:41:35.985]  I was in the crowd of men.
[02:41:36.025 --> 02:41:37.265]  They were chillaxed.
[02:41:37.445 --> 02:41:38.005]  Oh, yes.
[02:41:38.145 --> 02:41:38.945]  Oh, I mean.
[02:41:39.165 --> 02:41:44.567]  They get an adrenaline rush and they get pumped up from it because the evil rewards its servants.
[02:41:45.207 --> 02:41:46.107]  Part of the problem with
[02:41:46.877 --> 02:41:50.460]  Religion, and I'm not slamming you as being a Christian, is we forget that.
[02:41:50.580 --> 02:42:01.167]  We forget that the mass consciousness of this planet right now is all looking for an outward being, a Christ or whatever, to come and save it.
[02:42:01.608 --> 02:42:10.414]  And to be honest with you, most of these so-called politicians that consider themselves Christians, they laugh when you call upon the name of Jesus.
[02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:14.417]  They just, you know, shrug it off and say, well, you know, that doesn't exist.
[02:42:14.938 --> 02:42:38.492]  If you look at the universe, and I'll make it brief, but if you look at the universe and what's been going on in the last, oh, ten years, science has discovered so many more new galaxies and solar systems, and kind of just the short premise, the essence of the One, whether you want to place a label on it as call it God or whatever, is coming this direction, and that is why the darkness is working so fervently
[02:42:39.105 --> 02:42:42.047]  to control humanity to the best of their ability.
[02:42:42.067 --> 02:42:43.207]  Well, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:42:43.227 --> 02:42:43.928]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:43.948 --> 02:42:44.508]  I've got to move on.
[02:42:44.548 --> 02:42:45.668]  I've got a lot of callers here.
[02:42:46.089 --> 02:42:47.509]  But it's weird that we have themes.
[02:42:47.549 --> 02:42:51.051]  I can only talk about one thing and then it's a theme of religion or a theme of this.
[02:42:51.091 --> 02:42:58.055]  But yeah, but in the real world, in this physical fourth dimension or third dimension, you can sit here and you can look
[02:43:00.812 --> 02:43:04.594]  And how the technology's threatening the elite, but also a double-edged sword against us.
[02:43:04.914 --> 02:43:06.694]  How they're losing control at every level.
[02:43:07.055 --> 02:43:10.056]  I mean, the elite is worried, but they also have that hubris.
[02:43:10.376 --> 02:43:12.437]  Do you think that hubris will be their undoing, Webster?
[02:43:13.037 --> 02:43:17.339]  I think the neocons are the politically stupidest people we've ever seen.
[02:43:17.919 --> 02:43:22.141]  They think that if you bomb Iran, that will somehow turn the Iranians against the mullahs.
[02:43:22.561 --> 02:43:23.001]  And it won't.
[02:43:23.021 --> 02:43:23.841]  It'll do the opposite.
[02:43:24.281 --> 02:43:24.902]  About evil.
[02:43:25.382 --> 02:43:26.802]  We have various brands of evil.
[02:43:26.842 --> 02:43:27.943]  Right now, we've had one
[02:43:28.697 --> 02:43:38.988]  A single faction of a single brand of evil has been controlling all the institutions, the Presidency, the two Houses of Congress, and the courts for six years.
[02:43:39.008 --> 02:43:41.691]  And we need a separation of powers to separate evil.
[02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:50.340]  Right, and it's a basic conservative argument that we've got to get back to divided government, the checks and balances, the way the system is supposed to work.
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:51.521]  Now, you can say,
[02:43:52.133 --> 02:43:53.533]  Yeah, but the Democrats are evil.
[02:43:53.573 --> 02:43:55.614]  Yes, in many ways they're another brand of evil.
[02:43:55.954 --> 02:43:59.535]  But what we have to then do is play one brand of evil against the other.
[02:43:59.875 --> 02:44:03.916]  With this, we can probably diminish the net amount of evil in the universe.
[02:44:03.956 --> 02:44:20.340]  And what I'm looking forward to is when the Democratic House, which I think will come about, I hope it will, when they issue their first subpoenas to Bush administration officials on everything from 9-11 to Iraq, to Katrina, to prescription drugs, to habeas corpus, Pfizer,
[02:44:21.076 --> 02:44:22.037]  NSA wiretaps.
[02:44:22.417 --> 02:44:26.699]  Somebody like David Addington in Cheney's office is going to say, no, we won't do it.
[02:44:26.779 --> 02:44:27.580]  We're not coming.
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:28.360]  You get no doubt.
[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:29.981]  And then you're going to have a constitutional crisis.
[02:44:30.001 --> 02:44:31.382]  You'll have a constitutional crisis.
[02:44:31.402 --> 02:44:32.763]  You'll have contempt of Congress.
[02:44:33.143 --> 02:44:34.283]  And it'll be impeachment.
[02:44:34.644 --> 02:44:36.325]  Not because Pelosi doesn't want it.
[02:44:36.385 --> 02:44:37.465]  She said she doesn't want it.
[02:44:37.505 --> 02:44:38.166]  But here's the problem.
[02:44:38.206 --> 02:44:42.728]  Pelosi's shown he'll hit the entire Congress with another huge anthrax attack.
[02:44:42.908 --> 02:44:44.629]  Well, and then let them fight.
[02:44:44.709 --> 02:44:46.170]  But that kind of fight is better.
[02:44:46.530 --> 02:44:49.772]  And the thing that I also think is important is concerning the Democrats,
[02:44:50.256 --> 02:44:53.859]  You've got the Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emanuel, warmonger position.
[02:44:54.199 --> 02:44:57.222]  You've also got the Mertha position, which I think is much more moderate.
[02:44:57.242 --> 02:44:59.184]  What do you think of this new guy, Obama?
[02:45:00.084 --> 02:45:01.826]  I wouldn't trust him at all.
[02:45:01.886 --> 02:45:05.269]  I think he's an unprincipled opportunist.
[02:45:05.289 --> 02:45:09.212]  He's basically a footstool for Hillary.
[02:45:09.513 --> 02:45:10.113]  I think so.
[02:45:10.634 --> 02:45:18.100]  But the issue is, if the Democratic Party, with a lot of the hand-picked candidates of Rahm Emanuel,
[02:45:18.576 --> 02:45:25.340]  If they try to continue the war or support a wider war, that will destroy the Democratic Party over the next two years.
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:30.503]  Yeah, so we're seeing a prime move now into a real third party or true second party.
[02:45:30.903 --> 02:45:36.227]  If the Democratic Party fails that test, it will cease to exist, and this is all part of this party realignment.
[02:45:36.547 --> 02:45:41.930]  We've got to remember, for the past 40 years, since about 68, 70, or thereabouts, we've been living
[02:45:42.446 --> 02:45:50.156]  Under a party system dominated by reaction and the collapse of the labor movement and political apathy, as you well point out.
[02:45:50.176 --> 02:46:00.369]  Yeah, but let me go back, well I agree, but let me go back for a moment to God and evil and all of this, because so many people are scared right now and people get more towards their faith, which is a good thing.
[02:46:00.769 --> 02:46:02.730]  But it's not a real faith, folks.
[02:46:02.810 --> 02:46:07.374]  It's a counterfeit if God's telling you to lay down and not get involved, then God will do it.
[02:46:07.734 --> 02:46:13.458]  God says, you go out and you have faith and you take action and you stand up against adversity, and then I'll be with you.
[02:46:13.878 --> 02:46:28.067]  And so for people who think that God's going to do it, all of history and common sense and the law of nature that God has set in motion shows that God rewards those that help themselves.
[02:46:28.087 --> 02:46:28.908]  Isn't that true, Webster?
[02:46:30.589 --> 02:46:30.649]  Yes.
[02:46:31.009 --> 02:46:32.210]  One is to love God.
[02:46:32.290 --> 02:46:32.991]  This is safe.
[02:46:33.391 --> 02:46:36.534]  But there's also that second one that says, love your neighbor.
[02:46:36.794 --> 02:46:37.895]  That means good works.
[02:46:38.035 --> 02:46:42.959]  That means clothes the naked, feed the hungry, house the homeless, and the rest of it.
[02:46:43.459 --> 02:46:46.442]  And if you're not doing the second one, you're not fulfilling.
[02:46:46.522 --> 02:46:48.463]  So you've got to do that part too.
[02:46:48.503 --> 02:46:50.645]  And that means practical action in the here and now.
[02:46:52.395 --> 02:46:58.380]  Yeah, I don't know how we got into this position of everybody just saying, oh, I'm a non-actor in history, I'm going to step out of the flow of history.
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.522]  You can't step out of the flow of history, folks, you're going to be run over.
[02:47:02.443 --> 02:47:05.565]  And that, again, that is not what Christianity was at the beginning.
[02:47:05.605 --> 02:47:12.130]  That is not how it was forged in this terrible crucible of the Roman Empire, with Nero and Caligula running around.
[02:47:12.370 --> 02:47:15.893]  Yeah, marrying their horses, splitting children's throats, gobbling their blood.
[02:47:16.153 --> 02:47:17.914]  Exactly, and we're not far from that now.
[02:47:18.435 --> 02:47:20.156]  And for those who don't know, that really happened in Rome.
[02:47:20.176 --> 02:47:21.257]  Why don't you talk about Caligula?
[02:47:22.045 --> 02:47:28.631]  Well, I have brought up my chapters in the Bush book, is that Bush, the elder, is American Caligula.
[02:47:29.251 --> 02:47:41.982]  They would essentially, he would go to the theater of Marcellus in Rome, and they would have a theatrical spectacle, and if the script called for somebody to die, it said let's, you know, at this point somebody's crucified, well that guy would really die.
[02:47:42.002 --> 02:47:50.349]  And then can you imagine going to the Circus Maximus and presiding over the battles of gladiators, where hundreds and hundreds of people would be killed
[02:47:50.771 --> 02:47:56.134]  As a part of an afternoon's entertainment for the greater benefit of the emperor.
[02:47:56.174 --> 02:48:01.877]  Remember, they used to say, panna a mezzo-circense, bread and circuses, was what the Roman mob wanted.
[02:48:03.058 --> 02:48:10.922]  Again, we have got to take urgent measures to prevent society from getting... Well, I'm sure, because you speak fluent Italian and have been over there a lot and are into it.
[02:48:11.343 --> 02:48:16.646]  What about Nero would dress up like a werewolf and eat children at parties, gobbling them?
[02:48:16.706 --> 02:48:17.306]  I mean, this is just...
[02:48:18.061 --> 02:48:29.927]  He would disguise himself and go out in the streets and commit wanton murders, but he also thought he had to be the greatest opera singer in the world, and if anybody beat him in an opera contest, that person would be found dead the next day.
[02:48:31.508 --> 02:48:33.609]  Did you ever read the part about dressing up like the werewolf?
[02:48:34.770 --> 02:48:36.651]  I think a lot of it is from Suetonius, right?
[02:48:36.671 --> 02:48:40.433]  The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, but we also have Tacitus' Annals of Imperial Rome.
[02:48:40.613 --> 02:48:41.713]  Yeah, we're about to go live.
[02:48:41.733 --> 02:48:42.934]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:48.837 --> 02:48:52.020]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:54.322]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.682 --> 02:49:02.348]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.029 --> 02:49:10.075]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.475 --> 02:49:17.341]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.836 --> 02:49:21.877]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.197 --> 02:49:25.698]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.158 --> 02:49:27.999]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.419 --> 02:49:32.340]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:54.933 --> 02:51:57.755]  I'll be on the radio coming up this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:51:57.775 --> 02:51:59.776]  from News Radio 590 KOBJ.
[02:52:00.317 --> 02:52:03.679]  From as far north as Southern Oklahoma all the way down past San Antonio.
[02:52:04.747 --> 02:52:05.087]  Yeah, afternoon.
[02:52:05.107 --> 02:52:07.148]  I was just wondering if you were aware of the fact
[02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:45.692]  Don King, that was a big player in Don DeCamp's investigation out in Omaha, Nebraska of the pedophile ring.
[02:52:45.712 --> 02:52:46.752]  You mean Larry King?
[02:52:47.292 --> 02:52:50.133]  Not of Larry King singing and a big black guy named Larry King, yeah.
[02:52:50.373 --> 02:52:50.573]  Right.
[02:52:51.254 --> 02:52:56.575]  Yeah, well this guy in Maryland, he appears to be the same one with the bushy hair and a white promoter.
[02:52:57.091 --> 02:53:00.033]  And he's endorsed, um... No, it's not the same.
[02:53:00.053 --> 02:53:01.855]  It's not the same Don King.
[02:53:02.175 --> 02:53:07.359]  Not the same guy, but since you talk about Maryland politics, I'm up to my neck in this.
[02:53:07.559 --> 02:53:24.053]  And again, the issue again with Michael Steele trying to get the seat in the Senate here against Ben Cardin is that Michael Steele is attempting to present himself as some kind of a stand-up comedian rather than another warmonger vote for Bush.
[02:53:24.073 --> 02:53:25.494]  In other words, a member of that same
[02:53:26.050 --> 02:53:26.651]  Lockstep.
[02:53:36.454 --> 02:53:37.034]  You know, it's funny.
[02:53:37.054 --> 02:53:38.295]  They look a lot alike, but no.
[02:53:38.335 --> 02:53:40.115]  Larry King and Don King are two different men.
[02:53:40.135 --> 02:53:41.175]  I think that's it.
[02:53:41.516 --> 02:53:42.396]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:53:42.736 --> 02:53:44.716]  Hey, you've got to ask the question to find out, brother.
[02:53:45.017 --> 02:53:45.557]  Yeah, brother.
[02:53:46.357 --> 02:53:46.737]  Thank you.
[02:53:47.137 --> 02:53:47.657]  Thank you.
[02:53:47.717 --> 02:53:48.978]  Barney's a good World War II vet.
[02:53:49.058 --> 02:53:50.678]  I should ask him what he thinks of HR 6166.
[02:53:51.679 --> 02:53:52.999]  Barney's been calling me for ten years.
[02:53:53.539 --> 02:53:56.040]  Let's go ahead and I haven't heard from him in about a year either, Barney.
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:57.280]  We call back more often than that.
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:53:59.721]  Let's talk to Zach in New York.
[02:54:00.301 --> 02:54:01.121]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:01.341 --> 02:54:02.062]  Hello, Zach.
[02:54:02.082 --> 02:54:03.282]  You're on with Webster Tarpley.
[02:54:04.379 --> 02:54:21.110]  I remember when they finally passed that legislation that Bush signed, the DTD Act, you spoke of looking at your kids all night and thinking about leaving, and if you were to decide to go or you were in a council with someone who had made the decision to go or were advising family members to leave, I was wondering where would be the
[02:54:22.727 --> 02:54:26.628]  Well, I'm not giving up the fort, I'm not abandoning the ship, but I think we have a good chance of winning.
[02:54:26.648 --> 02:54:34.290]  I'm just saying it makes you think about evacuating your family, but I added the proviso to the end of it, that there's nowhere really to run.
[02:54:34.310 --> 02:54:36.491]  I mean, Webster, if you were going to run, where would you run to?
[02:54:37.031 --> 02:54:38.872]  I wouldn't think of running right now.
[02:54:38.972 --> 02:54:43.213]  I would think about repealing that monstrosity that has abolished habeas corpus.
[02:54:43.273 --> 02:54:48.074]  It means that Bush can declare anybody, you, me, the lamppost, enemy combatant,
[02:54:48.695 --> 02:54:50.415]  Off to Guantanamo, key thrown away.
[02:54:50.696 --> 02:54:51.816]  You say, but I'm a citizen.
[02:54:51.856 --> 02:54:54.217]  You'll never get a hearing to prove that you're a citizen.
[02:54:54.237 --> 02:54:55.657]  They'll say, you're really not a citizen.
[02:54:55.697 --> 02:54:58.818]  You're some kind of a, you know, somebody who was smuggled in.
[02:54:59.578 --> 02:55:04.219]  The other question, of course, is we've got a, looks like a fascist majority on the Supreme Court.
[02:55:04.259 --> 02:55:05.580]  You can do two things about that.
[02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:10.161]  You can impeach Supreme Court judges, or you can pack them, one or the other, or both.
[02:55:10.961 --> 02:55:11.461]  Pack them in.
[02:55:11.561 --> 02:55:12.682]  Pack in some new judges.
[02:55:13.062 --> 02:55:14.042]  FDR tried to do it.
[02:55:14.082 --> 02:55:15.142]  Would have been a good thing then.
[02:55:15.482 --> 02:55:18.023]  Might get necessary now in the weeks and months ahead.
[02:55:19.441 --> 02:55:25.403]  We have a known mob boss, Scalia, who literally does the meh symbol of reporters.
[02:55:25.443 --> 02:55:26.383]  I mean, he's something else.
[02:55:27.783 --> 02:55:28.844]  It's an absolute low.
[02:55:28.884 --> 02:55:32.865]  I mean, I guess, you know, we've had very severe problems with the Supreme Court.
[02:55:32.885 --> 02:55:35.465]  It's always been the most reactionary branch.
[02:55:35.646 --> 02:55:36.366]  Thank you, Jack.
[02:55:36.446 --> 02:55:39.607]  Alright, David in Oklahoma, quickly, go ahead.
[02:55:42.948 --> 02:55:44.288]  Yes, sir, you've got about 30 seconds.
[02:55:45.012 --> 02:55:48.376]  I was going to make a comment about the caller that called in earlier.
[02:55:48.656 --> 02:55:49.938]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:55:50.018 --> 02:56:01.492]  There is a report out of KOCO out of Oklahoma City that the Secret Service will be showing up in schools to give security updates and tell them how they can upgrade their security around the schoolhouse.
[02:56:02.393 --> 02:56:03.073]  Infowars.com.
[02:56:03.094 --> 02:56:05.056]  Yeah, the feds are taking control of the schools, yeah.
[02:56:06.067 --> 02:56:15.735]  And there was a plan I reported on three years ago that if there's a natural disaster or terror attack, they're going to take your children to FEMA camps and then make you come and enroll yourself to get them back.
[02:56:16.375 --> 02:56:17.156]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:17.196 --> 02:56:18.897]  Webster Tarpley, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:56:19.238 --> 02:56:20.138]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:56:20.178 --> 02:56:21.019]  More power to you.
[02:56:21.319 --> 02:56:23.001]  More power to you, my friend.
