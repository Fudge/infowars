[00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:06.473]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:08.174]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:09.996]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.477]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:13.118]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:17.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:22.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.973]  We are now into our number two, Dr. Doug Rocky, the former head of the Pentagon's D.U.
[00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:33.555]  Weapons Program and Research Program, wrote the book
[00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.306]  Literally on DU, their training manuals.
[00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:40.909]  He'll be joining us coming up later in the hour.
[00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:59.059]  Paul Watson discovered via tips that openly there's been a ruling that all file sharing of any type will be banned unless you're a governmentally licensed entity and that'll cost, in some cases we're talking about these licenses costing hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars.
[00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.380]  It'll be like getting a radio station.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.421]  The real cost is the licensing.
[00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.370]  Hi Alex.
[00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.551]  I was wondering if there's any Bill O'Reilly interviews in the future?
[00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.251]  Oh, I'd pay to see that.
[00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:42.715]  I was invited to fly for a taping of Planet Man Cow, but I couldn't make it, so we sent my radio producer, Kevin Smith, who did a great job.
[00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:45.456]  Is there any more mainstream interviews coming up?
[00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:54.702]  You know, I've been contacted five, six times by Fox, and they always cancelled interviews with me in the past, so I mean... It's a shame.
[00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:57.804]  What about Keith Olbermann?
[00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:00.106]  No, I haven't gotten any calls from MSNBC.
[00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:02.047]  Alright.
[00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.251]  Just wondering.
[00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:04.933]  Thank you sir, I appreciate the call.
[00:02:04.953 --> 00:02:06.434]  Ian in New York, you're on the air.
[00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:08.195]  Alex?
[00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:08.715]  Yes.
[00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:31.632]  Hi, I know how you promote the water system and I just want to say it's important for people to like eat really healthy because you have a clear mind and I came across, it's called Goji Berry and I take the supplement and it's, I sleep better, I think better,
[00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:36.631]  I don't get depressed anymore and I'm just wanting to tell people about that.
[00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:45.538]  I take the supplements, but I never took like Zoloft or Prozac or any of that junk, but this stuff really works.
[00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.723]  If you ever heard of David Wolf, he's all about like raw foods and stuff.
[00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:55.946]  It's really important to like eat healthy because they put junk in our food.
[00:02:56.494 --> 00:03:12.620]  Well, yeah, the preservatives are most of the time based on petrochemicals, and they're totally poisonous, and it's in almost all processed foods, and I have gotten almost completely away from processed foods, unless when I'm on the road, and if I eat processed food, I immediately feel bad.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:24.024]  Yeah, but I really would like you to look into the Goji berry if you need more energy, because I know you're up all hours and stuff, and it really, like,
[00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:29.914]  I go to sleep like dead tired and I'll wake up four hours later and be fine.
[00:03:29.974 --> 00:03:32.936]  I used to sleep like 12-13 hours a day.
[00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:37.538]  I don't know anything about that Barry, but you've got to watch stimulants though.
[00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:38.578]  Over time it can get you.
[00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:39.899]  Thanks for the call.
[00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:40.599]  I appreciate it.
[00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Utah.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.400]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.481]  Hey, what's up?
[00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:46.161]  How are you doing today?
[00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:46.681]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:49.923]  Hey, I had someone talk about some FEMA grants.
[00:03:51.401 --> 00:04:18.327]  Back in the 90s where I lived they built a big computer facility up on the mountain in Utah County and they haven't really filled it up and used it to its full potential and I've been talking to people and they said with a few modifications that place could be turned into a prison and it's only like a mile or two away from the state prison here in Utah County and I was wondering, you know, do other people in other states have these kind of
[00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:28.419]  Facilities built that they don't know about and they just think there's some kind of a legitimate a place of business or You know what's going to happen.
[00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:47.548]  You know are they going to you know swing into And turn it full into a prison one of these days Anything else because I can answer that question when we get back Okay, and then yeah, just on that guy that just called about the berry I stopped eating fast food and stop drinking soft drinks and
[00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:48.865]  I stick a lot better.
[00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:49.707]  I don't have headaches.
[00:04:49.807 --> 00:04:50.688]  I feel a lot better.
[00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.115]  I'd encourage people to get off the preservatives.
[00:04:56.556 --> 00:04:57.237]  God bless you.
[00:04:57.257 --> 00:04:57.918]  Thanks for the call.
[00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:58.679]  I heartily agree.
[00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:05.162]  It's here!
[00:05:05.382 --> 00:05:10.125]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:18.189]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.913]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.313 --> 00:05:33.217]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.710]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.551]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:43.952]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:48.193]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:06.350]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:13.736]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:24.525]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:29.269]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.532]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:06:34.732 --> 00:06:37.673]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:47.759]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:49.200]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188.
[00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:52.182]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.833]  The Japanese have used magnetic therapy for thousands of years, and it's more popular today than ever before.
[00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:14.339]  Established in 2000, Arizona Unipol Magnetics, AUM, is the number one online source for the superb Dr. Philpott-approved polar power magnetics.
[00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.762]  Now offering a complete line of these fine magnetics in an easy-to-read mail-order catalog.

[00:08:07.372 --> 00:08:08.433]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.254]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:11.715]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:13.537]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:18.021]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:22.305]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:46.707]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:51.690 --> 00:09:00.576]  I have this studio phone in here that for some reason the one they put in here doesn't have a turn off the ringer switch and somebody keeps calling.
[00:09:01.352 --> 00:09:05.796]  Over and over and over again, right as I get in here on air.
[00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:11.081]  You've always got to love these moments when that happens.
[00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.703]  All right, we are back in the saddle.
[00:09:13.223 --> 00:09:18.868]  Dr. Doug Rockey will be joining us here in just a minute or two to talk about DU.
[00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:21.190]  I'll explain why I think this is so important.
[00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:24.013]  Obviously, many of you know it's important here in just a moment.
[00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:27.056]  But to answer the fellow's question from the last segment,
[00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:36.566]  A lot of times things turn into rumors, not because they are rumors, but because people don't have the facts.
[00:09:36.606 --> 00:09:41.170]  They don't know where the original source for the claim arose.
[00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:45.874]  And in the late 80s, right through the 1990s, up until today, late 2006,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:10:13.946]  We hear about portable jails with bolts and chains in the floors, and federal vehicles positioned around the country, and armored vehicle caches around the nation, and how different water treatment facilities have had extra barbed wire fences and holding facilities built, and how there are secret camps in every
[00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:15.820]  Major U.S.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:35.648]  City and how they're just waiting for us and there's all these dual-use facilities and they plan to use the soccer stadiums and the football stadiums and the baseball stadiums to hold people during emergencies and they've got federal relocation hubs and of course people don't know where because they haven't done the research.
[00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:40.391]  They're in Denver and then Oklahoma City and Terre Haute, Indiana.
[00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:43.689]  All of that is not a rumor.
[00:10:43.949 --> 00:11:02.475]  That happened because in the declassified portions of Rex 84 that came out in 1986, the government planned to use immigration riots as a pretext to then also arrest political dissidents in America and put them in FEMA camps.
[00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:06.236]  And in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover,
[00:11:07.424 --> 00:11:15.386]  I have a clip of the House-Senate Bipartisan Committee hearing where they openly talk about these camps and they say we can't discuss them, they're secret, but yes, that is the plan.
[00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:19.167]  And we have the Miami Herald News articles from 86 about it.
[00:11:20.968 --> 00:11:30.331]  And then they've had Top Off 1, Top Off 2, and other drills where the Feds now admit that they're going to use sports stadiums and they're going to confiscate our guns during emergencies.
[00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:31.791]  Well, you saw it in New Orleans.
[00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:50.533]  And they've had the drills, and they've drilled the police all over the country, and they've drilled the military, and they send the military to Bosnia, and they send the military to Kosovo, and they send the military to Macedonia, and they send them to Afghanistan and Iraq, and 120 plus other countries where actual police-slash-combat operations are going on.
[00:11:53.035 --> 00:11:58.719]  And so, quote, the rumor that there are all these secret camps, well they were never secret, people just didn't have the core research.
[00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:02.121]  Now, it was in the AP and in the Houston Chronicle this year,
[00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:03.941]  What about ten months ago?
[00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:32.206]  That indeed, they'd already built three one million man camps, that was actually in Newsmax four years ago, that they now were going to build another three hundred and sixty five million dollars, excuse me, three hundred and eighty five million dollars, in other camps, particularly in the southwest in Texas, and then Halliburton's division of Kellogg, Brown and Root, who runs the camps in Afghanistan and Central Asia, and of course in the Middle East and in Iraq, and some of the secret prisons in Eastern Europe.
[00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.502]  And so all of this is admitted.
[00:12:34.582 --> 00:12:42.585]  So yes, you have real live, the Manazar prison camp in the desert of California has been reopened and is manned, but just waiting.
[00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:44.506]  It holds tens of thousands.
[00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:52.769]  So you have real federal prisons, former World War II prisoner of war camps, former Japanese camps is where they held Japanese at Manazar.
[00:12:54.184 --> 00:12:55.545]  They're called Federal Prison Camps.
[00:12:55.625 --> 00:13:01.951]  Those have been reopened, expanded, refurbished, had the water put back in, had the power put back in, had new barracks built.
[00:13:02.452 --> 00:13:04.233]  They're expanding the camp, X-Ray Camp.
[00:13:04.253 --> 00:13:06.095]  They're saying they'll fly Americans out of the country.
[00:13:06.395 --> 00:13:10.940]  And then you've got all the other facilities, like you hear, oh, I hear there's a secret camp.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.485]  People always tell me, psst, Alex, there's a camp in Austin at the old airport.
[00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:17.986]  I go, where'd you hear that?
[00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:19.668]  I go, I don't know.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.082]  My neighbor says he talked to a cop who told him.
[00:13:23.523 --> 00:13:24.443]  But don't tell anybody.
[00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:29.688]  And I go, well they heard about it because I made a film about it in 2000 called The Takeover.
[00:13:30.148 --> 00:13:31.790]  And I got video inside.
[00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:43.820]  And then after I got video, the local news admitted that if there was ever any riots in Austin, they could hold 3,000 people at it and then land there on the old tarmac and fly people out to larger facilities.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.784]  So see, the rumor you heard was a Fox News cast here locally.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.662]  That was spurred by myself going out there interviewing people and getting video of it.
[00:13:54.623 --> 00:13:57.924]  Bolts, chains on the floors, barbed wire inside to tie you down.
[00:13:57.964 --> 00:14:16.512]  And then remember, Pier 57, run by Bechtel, privately in New York, a giant, derelict bus terminal, holding upwards of 2,000 people at any one time, could hold five times that number, with barbed wire inside in communal areas, troublemakers get chained to the floor, exact same layout, porta-potties,
[00:14:17.563 --> 00:14:25.748]  The whole nine yards, exactly what we have in the takeover, is then in martial law that I made in 2005.
[00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:28.410]  Every major city has them.
[00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.870]  Let me tell you about the Sunshine Project.
[00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:31.451]  We're going to go to Dr. Rocky here in just a moment.
[00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:33.873]  I appreciate him holding, but I've got to finish answering this question.
[00:14:35.504 --> 00:14:57.469]  reported four years ago, and this is public, they have the Pentagon documents, that every major city has a military warehouse with helicopters ready and then in a armored bunker in each facility there are opiate knockout gases and other classified gases, I'm told lethal, but the document doesn't say that, ready to knock out whole cities!
[00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:58.769]  Oh yeah!
[00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:00.129]  Oh yeah!
[00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:01.850]  But see that turns into a rumor.
[00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.310]  No, that's not a rumor!
[00:15:05.837 --> 00:15:08.058]  And it's not a rumor, they have microwave guns!
[00:15:08.578 --> 00:15:15.899]  Six years ago, before 9-11, they announced that every major city would be given a federal grant for Humvees with giant microwave guns on top.
[00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:17.419]  Okay?
[00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:20.180]  And then years after I saw the federal grants, it was in the news!
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.820]  But they said they're, quote, testing them.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:32.563]  Then, the head of the Air Force came out this year, and by the way, whenever they have Fiesta or some big thing in San Antonio, the Air Force military police are on the streets of San Antonio, giving tickets, helping cops.
[00:15:32.783 --> 00:15:32.963]  See?
[00:15:33.163 --> 00:15:34.123]  Endoplasmic commentatus.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.563]  But I don't know why the head of the Air Force said this.
[00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:37.264]  Remember a few months ago?
[00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:42.254]  He came out with ABC News and said, Oh, we need to go ahead and test these on the American people first before we use them overseas.
[00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:43.797]  We need to use these in crowd control.
[00:15:44.097 --> 00:15:46.322]  Then we can use them overseas saying, Hey, we use them on our own people.
[00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.812]  So the urban legends of the camps.
[00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:51.793]  You've got the real federal camps that are public.
[00:15:52.054 --> 00:15:56.517]  Then you've got the emergency relocation centers that then distribute you to the larger centers.
[00:15:56.857 --> 00:16:06.284]  Then you've got, yes, where the feds go out and just set up barbed wire fences and barracks and facilities and build guard towers in the middle of nowhere.
[00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:08.326]  Those are the secret ones.
[00:16:08.966 --> 00:16:10.468]  So let the rumors end.
[00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:12.269]  Let the documentation begin.
[00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:17.269]  There was a checkpoint on the highway in 98 on the day before Thanksgiving.
[00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.834]  Mike Hanson, does camera work for me?
[00:16:19.154 --> 00:16:21.862]  Driving down the road there at Belton, just south of Temple.
[00:16:22.725 --> 00:16:23.686]  And he sees U.S.
[00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:25.887]  Army out searching people, dragging stuff out of cars.
[00:16:25.927 --> 00:16:26.467]  He goes up.
[00:16:26.807 --> 00:16:28.628]  They walk over, tell him to turn his cameras off.
[00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.430]  Then we find out it's a drill, but it's real.
[00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.872]  They're pulling real people over, but then the police and the military are saying it's a drill.
[00:16:35.112 --> 00:16:38.534]  Then an FBI agent pulls up and tells Mike, here's a press release.
[00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:39.995]  This is totally legal.
[00:16:40.095 --> 00:16:50.221]  Gave him a secret document on accident that's on Infowars.com saying that police in 77 Texas counties are serving search warrants and police uniforms.
[00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:52.845]  Are kicking down doors, are doing everything.
[00:16:53.787 --> 00:16:55.049]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now about it.
[00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.776]  The point is, this is going on everywhere.
[00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:13.850]  Now, Dr. Doug Rocky, whose bio is so lengthy there's no way to even go over all of it, but I'd like him in a nutshell to tell us about himself, his amazing service to the country, his pedigree.
[00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.051]  He's the guy that wrote the book for the Pentagon on DU.
[00:17:16.091 --> 00:17:17.693]  He's the guy that did the investigations for them.
[00:17:17.973 --> 00:17:19.914]  He's the guy that made the training videos for them.
[00:17:20.335 --> 00:17:21.996]  Dr. Doug Rocky, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:17:22.016 --> 00:17:24.058]  Do you want to comment on the camp stuff I was just talking about?
[00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:32.013]  I've heard this stuff over and over again and back in the 90s when we started working with the non-legal weapons research at the U.S.
[00:17:32.053 --> 00:17:38.116]  Army Chemical School, we actually tested this stuff and did this stuff at what's called Mount Villages, M-O-U-T-E, but Villages.
[00:17:38.537 --> 00:17:39.377]  I still get the videos.
[00:17:39.777 --> 00:17:41.598]  It's just, it's astonishing.
[00:17:41.778 --> 00:17:53.584]  And then we'll go on to the other stuff, but if anybody wants to know, all they have to do is go to the Thomas Register, again that's where federal documents are, pull up Presidential Decision Directives, number 39,
[00:17:55.712 --> 00:17:59.194]  And number 62 written by Clinton Gore and Janet Reno.
[00:17:59.774 --> 00:18:00.115]  And read.
[00:18:00.795 --> 00:18:01.355]  And then cry.
[00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:05.218]  Absolutely.
[00:18:05.858 --> 00:18:07.519]  Why are they gearing up to do this, sir?
[00:18:08.259 --> 00:18:15.644]  Well, you know, before what Clinton had planned on doing was suspend the elections and impose martial law and then all that fell apart.
[00:18:16.444 --> 00:18:19.206]  And it's just a whole combination of everything.
[00:18:19.246 --> 00:18:21.007]  But it's real scary.
[00:18:21.027 --> 00:18:23.448]  It's just real, real scary.
[00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:24.709]  And then all of the, you know,
[00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:30.783]  Chemical Biological Munitions Test, the Project Shad Test that were done extensively and continue to this day.
[00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:35.086]  The most recent ones, again, Bexalisco Baggai, which is a biological weapon.
[00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:38.849]  And then also the same thing with all of the pesticides and herb agents.
[00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:39.669]  Yeah, that was released.
[00:18:39.969 --> 00:18:41.330]  What, what, three tons of that?
[00:18:41.751 --> 00:18:42.571]  I'm going from memory.
[00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:47.615]  The Daly Oklahoman, two years ago, three tons of that was released over cities.
[00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:59.718]  Yeah, one of the big problems that I got involved with, the EPA ordered, you know, as an Army officer, when I was asked to clean it up, was when they used it down at Pelham Range in Fort McClellan, Alabama, and it affected all the surrounding communities and the residents there.
[00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:04.680]  News stories hit it, and even the reporters that covered it ended up getting contaminated and taking it back to their families.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:12.203]  Now let's be clear though, Doctor, I want to come back and recap exactly who you are, and I apologize for making you hold while I went through all that info, and we're honored to have you.
[00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:13.721]  I want to be clear here.
[00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:20.784]  In some cases in Project Shad, they would order a serviceman to walk into a chamber, kill him with nerve gas, and then lie to his family.
[00:19:20.824 --> 00:19:25.705]  So, the government running this system will kill troops just to test something.
[00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:27.826]  I mean, that's how cold-blooded we're talking about.
[00:19:27.846 --> 00:19:28.846]  That's correct.
[00:19:29.507 --> 00:19:31.327]  And Project Shad has been done all over.
[00:19:31.387 --> 00:19:39.130]  Back in 1987, our team had to clean up a Project Shad mess that was left where chemical munitions were buried out behind the U.S.
[00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.811]  Army Reserve Center on East Main in Urbana, Illinois.
[00:19:43.254 --> 00:19:44.396]  It's unbelievable, sir.
[00:19:45.778 --> 00:19:47.000]  Again, it's all admitted.
[00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:53.250]  So for police and military listening, they for some reason abuse you more than even the general public.
[00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:55.354]  They think you're so stupid.
[00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.337]  Dr. Doug Rocky on the other side.
[00:19:57.357 --> 00:19:57.698]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.488 --> 00:20:06.249]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:10.470]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:17.012]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:20:17.272 --> 00:20:21.653]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[00:20:27.395 --> 00:20:32.900]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.

[00:21:01.207 --> 00:21:04.229]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:09.434]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:21:09.714 --> 00:21:14.057]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:23.283]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:27.106]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:32.429]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:39.394]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:21:39.914 --> 00:21:40.574]  What about you?
[00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:46.576]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:01.352]  Gold.
[00:22:01.692 --> 00:22:02.973]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:03.253 --> 00:22:09.339]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:13.343]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:15.585]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:17.927]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:18.067 --> 00:22:24.854]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[00:22:24.994 --> 00:22:26.315]  We're good to go.
[00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:46.555]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:49.417]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:55.802]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:22:55.963 --> 00:22:56.983]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:04.710]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.492]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:12.833]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:23:13.113 --> 00:23:14.053]  I was so amazed.
[00:23:14.293 --> 00:23:17.154]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:23:17.314 --> 00:23:19.215]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:23:19.595 --> 00:23:24.777]  SolayWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:23:25.257 --> 00:23:31.180]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan Salt.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.161]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:36.602]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:40.704]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:23:40.964 --> 00:23:42.405]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:47.890]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.734]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com, or call 312-224-2710.
[00:23:51.754 --> 00:23:51.794]  312-224-2710.
[00:24:28.553 --> 00:24:35.800]  The reason depleted uranium, the Shad Project, all of it is so important is because it's admittedly radioactive, deadly poison.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.562]  It's admittedly salting the earth for 4.5 billion years.
[00:24:39.924 --> 00:24:42.945]  And it shows the mindset of the elite that they use this.
[00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:48.126]  They've had this since the 50s, but they just started using it in the last 15 years or so.
[00:24:48.626 --> 00:24:49.627]  The question is why?
[00:24:49.647 --> 00:25:00.069]  Dr. Doug Rocky, we got right into concentration camps and secret programs, but out of the gates, let's restart and tell folks who you are, your training.
[00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.810]  You've got quite a record, so folks know who they're listening to.
[00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:07.672]  I came into the military in 1967, so that's what, 39 years ago.
[00:25:10.117 --> 00:25:14.981]  And originally trained as an avionics technician in Bomb Nav Hardat.
[00:25:15.521 --> 00:25:18.203]  Flew combat missions and dropped bombs in Vietnam.
[00:25:19.064 --> 00:25:22.907]  Maintained the systems, got out, went to college, did a whole bunch of things.
[00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:26.730]  Went back and got recalled to active duty in 1974 for a summer.
[00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:32.194]  Then the Vietnam War ended and I said, I'm out of here.
[00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:38.199]  1980, went back into the National Guard as a combat medic, medical team leader, teaching emergency medicine, emergency rescue, hazardous materials and everything.
[00:25:39.477 --> 00:25:43.559]  83, I was transferred over to as an instructor for the U.S.
[00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:44.659]  Army to teach all of this.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.341]  86, got a direct commission after I'd rewritten the nuclear biological chemical warfare training program for the U.S.
[00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:50.621]  Army.
[00:25:51.502 --> 00:25:54.463]  And we just kept doing it and Gulf War One started.
[00:25:55.303 --> 00:26:02.826]  We had put together all the training operations, emergency response, cleanup procedures for all chemical, biological, hazardous materials, environmental exposures.
[00:26:03.576 --> 00:26:04.196]  The whole shebang.
[00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:06.177]  And specifically, your doctorate is in?
[00:26:07.177 --> 00:26:07.678]  Education.
[00:26:07.798 --> 00:26:08.318]  I'm a teacher.
[00:26:08.618 --> 00:26:09.438]  I'm a science teacher.
[00:26:09.718 --> 00:26:13.000]  But incredible background in emergency medicine.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.900]  You know, as a paramedic EMT type.
[00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:17.401]  Emergency rescue hazardous materials.
[00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:19.362]  So you've been at every level of it.
[00:26:20.122 --> 00:26:21.683]  When did DU enter the picture?
[00:26:21.723 --> 00:26:23.864]  When did you become the guy that wrote the book on DU?
[00:26:24.204 --> 00:26:29.766]  Well, with the completion of the ground war, they had not put any plans together for the response to the U.C.
[00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:30.486]  uranium emissions.
[00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:37.254]  And all of a sudden I got called over to the Command Headquarters in Escan Village, which is where the Medical Command Headquarters was.
[00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:40.957]  Got a written directive, the by name assignment from the Pentagon.
[00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:43.360]  And you know, they don't give this very often.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.562]  But they reached and bypassed all the active duty people.
[00:26:46.983 --> 00:26:48.724]  Bypassed all of the active duty people.
[00:26:49.365 --> 00:26:51.206]  And came down and picked me out as a reservist.
[00:26:51.406 --> 00:26:53.668]  Of course, at that time I had a lot of experience.
[00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:57.131]  And gave me the very specific task to go clean up the D.U.
[00:26:57.171 --> 00:26:58.713]  mess following Gulf War I.
[00:26:59.927 --> 00:27:04.891]  And took us three months to clean up 24 vehicles for shipment back to the United States.
[00:27:05.452 --> 00:27:08.394]  Shipped 15 Abrams tanks that were destroyed by DU friendly fire.
[00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:13.038]  Nine Bradley fighting vehicles were destroyed by DU friendly fire back to the United States.
[00:27:13.078 --> 00:27:17.642]  We buried a lot in the desert, you know, with the body parts and everything like that.
[00:27:18.383 --> 00:27:19.924]  Came back, we wrote all the reports.
[00:27:20.004 --> 00:27:24.969]  Eventually, the United States General Accounting Office got involved in February of 1992.
[00:27:27.185 --> 00:27:33.210]  The Secretariat got involved because there were all kinds of warnings and we did a special conference on this at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
[00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:39.394]  I was recalled to active duty to do the briefing before the Secretariat and gave them all the warnings and said what we needed to do.
[00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:42.777]  December of 92, we started the U.S.
[00:27:42.837 --> 00:27:44.658]  Army Environmental Policy Institute study.
[00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:46.480]  It was really interesting because
[00:27:47.654 --> 00:28:02.799]  When we started that in December of 1992, Assistant Secretary of the Army Walker, one of the very specific directives for us to do was figure out ways to reduce the toxicity of uranium emissions, put together all the education and training, and develop all the environmental remediation procedures.
[00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:14.502]  Lo and behold, in 1994, they bypassed all of the active duty people, everybody else, all of their full-time government scientists, and recalled me as Director of the Depleted Uranium Project.
[00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:20.560]  What I learned as a director, putting all the education and training together, writing the U.S.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.560]  Army Regulation 700-48, the U.S.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:32.082]  Army Pamphlet 700-48, that is the hands-on procedures, step-by-step procedures for response for uranium and other radioactive materials contamination use.
[00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:34.122]  We've modified the U.S.
[00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:35.363]  Army Technical Bulletin.
[00:28:36.583 --> 00:28:38.183]  And what I learned scared me.
[00:28:39.024 --> 00:28:40.604]  Because by this time, we were all sick.
[00:28:40.664 --> 00:28:41.964]  We had been denied medical care.
[00:28:42.724 --> 00:28:45.425]  To this day, this is now, what are we, November 28th?
[00:28:46.869 --> 00:28:46.929]  Of 2006.
[00:28:46.969 --> 00:28:47.549]  The U.S.
[00:28:47.569 --> 00:28:58.173]  Army, as of today, has never provided me or my staff the mandatory radio bioassay to test for uranium exposures in 15 years.
[00:29:01.255 --> 00:29:02.035]  It's unbelievable.
[00:29:02.215 --> 00:29:03.676]  Now, we've talked before.
[00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:07.837]  You then started discovering that they knew back in the 50s, the 60s, the 70s.
[00:29:07.917 --> 00:29:08.457]  In the 40s.
[00:29:08.677 --> 00:29:09.278]  In the 40s.
[00:29:09.338 --> 00:29:12.579]  And then, you know, one of the things that when we do the research as director,
[00:29:13.473 --> 00:29:26.508]  I uncovered all the reports that had been put together identifying all the health and environmental hazards as a result of the Israeli use of uranium munitions in the Sinai against the Egyptians in 1973 and 1974.
[00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:33.396]  And then slowly we got the medical records and the exposure records and talked with the people that were sick and it just scared us.
[00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.630]  Stay there.
[00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.511]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:35.531 --> 00:29:36.751]  Plenty of time to break this down.
[00:29:36.771 --> 00:29:37.991]  We'll stay with this until the next hour.
[00:29:38.432 --> 00:29:41.333]  As well, at the bottom of the next hour, Paul Watson joins us.
[00:29:41.353 --> 00:29:43.994]  They're going to ban all file sharing on the internet.
[00:29:44.014 --> 00:29:44.594]  We're not kidding.
[00:29:51.976 --> 00:29:52.877]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:54.958]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.878 --> 00:29:58.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.577 --> 00:31:03.558]  Good morning, honey!
[00:31:03.898 --> 00:31:04.459]  Wow!
[00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:09.904]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:31:10.204 --> 00:31:10.804]  Yeah.
[00:31:11.185 --> 00:31:12.606]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:16.369]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.331]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:20.493]  And what am I gonna do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:31:20.873 --> 00:31:22.655]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:31:22.855 --> 00:31:23.696]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:31:24.096 --> 00:31:26.358]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:31:26.619 --> 00:31:26.939]  What?

[00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:05.371]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.592 --> 00:32:08.974]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.174 --> 00:32:12.617]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.133]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.173 --> 00:32:21.638]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:32:21.678 --> 00:32:31.307]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:31.427 --> 00:32:32.788]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:38.213]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:43.133]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:43.153 --> 00:32:44.594]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.755 --> 00:32:48.217]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.237 --> 00:32:49.218]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:20.393 --> 00:33:25.819]  How and why do people that work for this government mindlessly trust them?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.045]  It's like you have a nice dog who you can beat upside the head with a baseball bat and he still loves you.
[00:33:33.107 --> 00:33:38.573]  I mean, I want police to know that run the warrantless checkpoints and break up the families and grab the kids with CPS.
[00:33:39.714 --> 00:33:42.397]  The people in the military that did gun confiscations in New Orleans,
[00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:45.591]  The FBI agents, all of you, you work for a government.
[00:33:46.031 --> 00:33:48.874]  And I mean, Project Shad's been in BBC, AP, you name it.
[00:33:49.174 --> 00:33:50.535]  Went until the late 80s.
[00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:54.158]  They would just mark somebody into a chamber, nerve gas them and kill them.
[00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:56.500]  Just a, quote, volunteer.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.961]  Oh, we're going to test the flu on you.
[00:33:58.381 --> 00:33:59.162]  Sign this waiver.
[00:33:59.202 --> 00:34:00.403]  They'd kill them.
[00:34:00.543 --> 00:34:02.124]  I mean, this is your government.
[00:34:03.732 --> 00:34:07.276]  Okay folks, I've interviewed people that were in the units that witnessed all of this.
[00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:08.518]  This is admitted.
[00:34:08.778 --> 00:34:11.401]  It doesn't just stop at black men and syphilis and Tuskegee.
[00:34:11.881 --> 00:34:15.065]  The globalists have a eugenics mindset.
[00:34:16.647 --> 00:34:19.010]  And they believe they're saving the earth by killing us off.
[00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.992]  But then they're schizophrenic in that.
[00:34:21.784 --> 00:34:30.570]  Or I guess you could say it's an oxymoron, because they're salting the earth, including proving grounds all over the world, with DU, with a four and a half billion year half-life.
[00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:49.942]  Dr. Doug Rockey, again, had already written high-level manuals for the government, and he was commissioned to go to the big cleanup and write a big manual, and then while he did his research, he discovered at the end of World War II, they had papers on, you know, using these weapons to basically dirty bomb whole cities,
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.621]  And I've heard Dr. Rockey speak of those documents.
[00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:53.442]  I've seen those documents.
[00:34:53.462 --> 00:34:54.062]  So they knew!
[00:34:54.382 --> 00:34:56.163]  He discovered they already knew.
[00:34:56.563 --> 00:34:58.084]  He discovered they just didn't care.
[00:34:58.104 --> 00:35:06.729]  And Dr. Rockey, what has happened where even generals in Iraq, who ought to know better, will move into bases that were bombed with DU?
[00:35:07.509 --> 00:35:13.772]  I've read in the reports that all they do is bring in dump trucks with sand and dump it on the blast holes.
[00:35:14.313 --> 00:35:15.673]  I mean, does that keep you safe?
[00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:16.854]  Not at all.
[00:35:16.894 --> 00:35:18.415]  I mean, it's complete, total arrogance.
[00:35:19.113 --> 00:35:27.299]  I mean, that was one of the things as a career, you know, military officer, scientist, teacher, you know, medic, whatever you want to have, I just got fed up with it.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.421]  I mean, we have to look at this whole thing.
[00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:31.342]  We have to look at the true casualties.
[00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:35.305]  You know, Gulf War I basically lasted 100 hours, okay?
[00:35:36.226 --> 00:35:40.449]  This was back in 90 and 91, and you had about 100 hours of real active combat.
[00:35:41.653 --> 00:35:45.894]  Out of that period, we'll say the period is actually from April and May of 1990.
[00:35:46.335 --> 00:35:51.976]  You have to understand April and May of 1990 when we started doing the insertions and operations over there.
[00:35:52.977 --> 00:35:56.638]  You know, bait and switch in Iraq to go into Kuwait through the fall of 1991.
[00:35:56.898 --> 00:36:00.299]  That's what we consider Gulf War I. The U.S.
[00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:08.422]  Department of Veteran Affairs in their Compensation and Pension Statistics Report, the most recent one, which was a summary of data through August 30th of 2006,
[00:36:10.123 --> 00:36:16.847]  is thoroughly acknowledged that out of the 696,842 of us that served in the Persian Gulf War, Gulf War I, Desert Storm, there's only 613,526 left alive.
[00:36:16.867 --> 00:36:17.408]  That's 80,000 have died.
[00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:35.643]  And that 271,192 of our sons and daughters, including myself and my team, applied for permanent disability with the U.S.
[00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:36.763]  Department of Veteran Affairs.
[00:36:36.863 --> 00:36:38.264]  So that's 40 plus percent?
[00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:39.424]  That's correct.
[00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:44.005]  And that's in the VA's own documents.
[00:36:44.025 --> 00:36:45.686]  They don't want the public to know any of this.
[00:36:46.526 --> 00:36:53.188]  And what's astonishing, at the completion of the Gulf War I, you have to understand, most of the deaths in Gulf War I were due to friendly fire.
[00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:53.968]  Okay?
[00:36:54.328 --> 00:36:55.008]  Or we shot our own.
[00:36:55.908 --> 00:36:57.789]  And I'm the officer that scraped them up with a putty knife.
[00:36:58.809 --> 00:37:00.789]  And did the confirmation and cleaned up the equipment.
[00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:01.650]  Our team did.
[00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:11.532]  But as of August 30th of 2006, for all the individuals that served in the Persian Gulf, Gulf War I, there's 12,580 that are dead.
[00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:17.374]  And I had a little over, I had about not even 500 dead during the actual conflict.
[00:37:18.243 --> 00:37:19.764]  From all sources.
[00:37:20.144 --> 00:37:25.565]  And that, you know, in the Encyclopedia Britannica, World Almanac, any of them, you'll find all those numbers.
[00:37:25.585 --> 00:37:27.646]  Yeah, it says 300 and something last time I checked.
[00:37:27.806 --> 00:37:28.106]  Yeah.
[00:37:28.466 --> 00:37:34.268]  But it's now at 12,580 for Gulf War I alone as of August 30th of 2006.
[00:37:34.308 --> 00:37:36.409]  And 80,000 total are dead.
[00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.689]  Yeah.
[00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:38.450]  Yeah.
[00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:45.892]  But you've got to remember, the ones where they got the 12,580 are the guys who are awarded permanent, you know, what's called C&P, service connection.
[00:37:46.895 --> 00:37:58.569]  Now let's go back to those who just joined us, because I even talked to troops who were in the First Gulf War and who are now in the Second, and I've been out at Crawford, and they walked up and said, you're a traitor, DU isn't bad!
[00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:00.812]  And I say, well did you clean it up?
[00:38:00.992 --> 00:38:03.175]  No, but I fired it out of my tank!
[00:38:04.386 --> 00:38:07.629]  And I'm just like, listen, this is the Army's own manual, sir.
[00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:16.815]  You know, even mining this stuff, when it's not anywhere near as strong, back in the 70s, the mining manuals, the government mining manuals said it was deadly.
[00:38:17.656 --> 00:38:20.018]  I mean, you are a doctor, you wrote the book on this.
[00:38:20.218 --> 00:38:21.679]  Will you tell them what it is?
[00:38:22.059 --> 00:38:25.422]  Because they seem to think, because they tell them it's good for them now that it is.
[00:38:26.322 --> 00:38:29.184]  Yeah, they lie to them because they want to sustain the use of uranium munitions.
[00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:45.896]  You have to understand, I received a direct written order that General Franks and General Brown handed to me in March of 1991 to lie in all our reports in order to sustain the use of uranium munitions and avoid all liability for known, anticipated, and verified adverse health and environmental effects.
[00:38:45.976 --> 00:38:52.121]  And that's the famed Los Alamos Memorandum, written by Colonel Michael Zeme, United States Marine Corps, Los Alamos, New Mexico.
[00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:54.766]  And that was dated March 1st of 91.
[00:38:54.806 --> 00:39:00.268]  The same thing happened with the AAPI Directive written by Assistant Secretary of the Army Walker in December of 92.
[00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:09.211]  They all have this idea, you have to understand, these are solid radioactive materials that have chemical toxicity, particulate irritation, radiological toxicity.
[00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:13.832]  When you inhale and just absorb or get any of this contamination into your body, you're going to get sick.
[00:39:14.273 --> 00:39:17.914]  When you fire a gun, you get contamination all over, you're going to breathe it in.
[00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.382]  We've thoroughly confirmed that with U.S.
[00:39:20.422 --> 00:39:29.364]  Navy troops that had got sick from firing the 20mm on the Navy Phalanx and, you know, being around the gun after it's been fired, all the way through to everybody else, continuously.
[00:39:30.065 --> 00:39:30.765]  It's that.
[00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:33.645]  But we have to understand, they lie to our troops.
[00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:42.107]  They lie to the American public about the number of casualties that we have as a result of Gulf War I and Gulf War II.
[00:39:42.887 --> 00:39:45.528]  I mean, we just went over the casualty figures from Gulf War I.
[00:39:47.162 --> 00:39:48.263]  Hardcore data.
[00:39:48.683 --> 00:39:55.087]  You can go to www.va.gov and then type in G-W-B-I-S, which is the code word for all this stuff.
[00:39:55.307 --> 00:39:58.929]  And let's give folks, Dr. Rocky, also how much was used in these wars.
[00:39:59.289 --> 00:40:02.611]  Okay, well, you know, the amount that was used by Israel, I don't know.
[00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:06.633]  It was, you know, it was there and it was used and we, you know, wouldn't work with all that stuff.
[00:40:07.174 --> 00:40:12.877]  In Gulf War I, we used about 375 tons of solid uranium incorporated into munitions.
[00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:14.398]  That's in Gulf War I.
[00:40:15.177 --> 00:40:19.021]  That figure comes from the guy that issued the ammo who was on my team and other of my team members.
[00:40:19.802 --> 00:40:24.286]  Okay, he's sick, also denied medical care, never got medical care, they flat refused to give it to him.
[00:40:24.927 --> 00:40:35.837]  Okay, we know in the Balkans in 94 and 95, because I wrote the emergency response procedures for that, when I was at the University of Illinois in the chemistry department, we used approximately 30 tons.
[00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:45.545]  And then we went back into the bog, and then what we did in Okinawa in 95 and 96, we don't know how much was used there, they just trashed Okinawa, some islands over there.
[00:40:46.165 --> 00:40:49.526]  Then we come up to the Balkans in 99, and that's about 40 tons.
[00:40:50.947 --> 00:40:54.288]  Then we get into Afghanistan, which estimates are 1000 tons.
[00:40:54.348 --> 00:41:00.291]  And this is all medically confirmed, the exposures are medically confirmed, the on-site measurements have confirmed the use.
[00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:03.672]  And then we get into Gulf War II within Iraq.
[00:41:04.773 --> 00:41:05.073]  Okay?
[00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:06.536]  And the U.S.
[00:41:06.576 --> 00:41:13.321]  Army back within a couple months thoroughly confirmed that they'd used 500 tons of uranium munitions within just a couple of months.
[00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.472]  of the initial start, and they continue to do it daily.
[00:41:16.812 --> 00:41:35.348]  And now, Doctor, now, and of course you've got all these specific numbers in front of you, but I've got the reports here as well, now it's not just served up in the Vulcan cannon and the ATN Warthog, it's not just served up in the Sabo rounds and the Abrams tank and its variants, it's not just in the Bradley fighting vehicle, the Warrior's cannons, now they're serving it in the small arms.
[00:41:35.628 --> 00:41:42.394]  Yeah, 7.62, the old M60 machine gun, the .50 cal machine gun, Barrett manufactures the .50 cal sniper rifle,
[00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:46.775]  On his literature for his website, he brags about how well the DU round works in his rifle.
[00:41:47.736 --> 00:41:48.916]  That's one of the selling points.
[00:41:49.656 --> 00:41:53.917]  We lost an Abrams tank due to a .50 cal rifle round, DU round.
[00:41:54.458 --> 00:41:56.318]  Because we did the investigations on that.
[00:41:56.358 --> 00:42:00.920]  That was right after Gulf War II started, Operation Iraqi Freedom started.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.521]  Some idiot Marine with a .50 cal took out an Abrams tank.
[00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:05.861]  Well, you know, there it goes.
[00:42:06.241 --> 00:42:08.242]  Then we've got the 20mm in the Navy Phalanx.
[00:42:08.262 --> 00:42:10.602]  Then we've got the 30mm in the A-10 Warthog aircraft.
[00:42:12.954 --> 00:42:15.816]  Uh, then we have the 25mm in the Bradley firing vehicle.
[00:42:15.836 --> 00:42:18.297]  I did all the research on that at the Nevada Test Site.
[00:42:18.817 --> 00:42:21.139]  And put the safety procedures and all that stuff together.
[00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:26.141]  Then we've got the 105mm, we've got the 120mm, the 125mm.
[00:42:26.662 --> 00:42:28.282]  Those are all kinetic energy rounds.
[00:42:28.303 --> 00:42:30.404]  Those are gigantic rods of uranium.
[00:42:30.524 --> 00:42:31.304]  Solid uranium.
[00:42:31.884 --> 00:42:33.325]  That's what makes these things so dangerous.
[00:42:33.345 --> 00:42:34.686]  They're not coated, they're not tipped.
[00:42:35.046 --> 00:42:36.847]  They're gigantic, solid rods.
[00:42:37.307 --> 00:42:40.909]  For example, the A-10 fires a DU round.
[00:42:40.929 --> 00:42:41.250]  30mm.
[00:42:42.705 --> 00:42:48.988]  Okay, every single round is three quarters of a pound of solid uranium, and it fires at a rate of 4,000 rounds per minute.
[00:42:49.008 --> 00:42:51.250]  That's a ton and a half of uranium on target per minute.
[00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:52.750]  It's incredible.
[00:42:53.251 --> 00:42:55.932]  The Abrams tank round is over 10 pounds of solid uranium.
[00:42:56.838 --> 00:42:59.000]  And then up and beyond that we have the cluster bombs.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.124]  Now the cluster bombs are used extraordinarily effectively in the Balkans and in the marketplace.
[00:43:03.524 --> 00:43:08.549]  They've used all over Iraq and then they used them extremely effectively throughout Lebanon now where the U.S.
[00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:10.911]  gave Israel all of this stuff to use.
[00:43:11.032 --> 00:43:14.315]  Well, I had another guy call on the show, a local who I've even met before.
[00:43:14.935 --> 00:43:17.676]  He's always getting in my face at events and stuff, telling me I'm wrong.
[00:43:18.157 --> 00:43:24.659]  And he said, I've got a cousin who's an Abrams commander and he's got a radiation badge and it isn't showing anything.
[00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:25.760]  It won't.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.921]  And you and that rock, you're a liar!
[00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:29.442]  It won't show anything.
[00:43:30.022 --> 00:43:31.142]  Because it's alpha and beta.
[00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:32.323]  It's primarily alpha and beta.
[00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.824]  You can wear all the badges all day long and you'll never detect it.
[00:43:35.244 --> 00:43:39.106]  One thing that we learned when we did the work is a standard Geiger counter won't even measure it.
[00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:41.401]  So what our team did is working with the U.S.
[00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:43.943]  Department of Energy and the people in the U.S.
[00:43:43.983 --> 00:43:49.228]  Army Research Staff, is we designed new, modified existing RADIAC equipment, which was U.S.
[00:43:49.268 --> 00:43:56.674]  Army PDR-77, with an RPO kit, modified the electronics, and we taught very specific procedures in order to measure it.
[00:43:56.754 --> 00:44:00.978]  I could have a room full of uranium dust and I'll never measure radioactivity.
[00:44:01.866 --> 00:44:06.487]  I have to have the alpha meter, the alpha detector, the scintillation probe.
[00:44:06.628 --> 00:44:09.849]  That specifically measures that type of radiation.
[00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:14.350]  And you can't have it more than a finger's thickness away from the material or you'll never find it.
[00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:23.473]  See, that's why it's so deadly is that it, again I'm repeating what you and others in the manuals I've read, because it just sits in there up against the cells and it's so small it pierces the cell wall.
[00:44:23.913 --> 00:44:25.673]  Well yeah, it tears the cells apart.
[00:44:25.794 --> 00:44:28.574]  Remember, these are 4.15 million electron volts.
[00:44:28.634 --> 00:44:30.415]  A cell operates on 10 electron volts.
[00:44:31.784 --> 00:44:36.685]  Okay, so I mean this is like standing in a puddle of water and sticking your fingers into a 440 outlet of 50 amps.
[00:44:37.905 --> 00:44:45.707]  I mean, it's so nasty and then the beta you won't measure either unless you're maybe four to six inches away with specialized probes.
[00:44:46.147 --> 00:44:53.109]  Now when we finished the project there were only 50 of these sets in existence in the whole Department of Defense and then two broke, there were only 48 and I don't know what they've had since.
[00:44:53.789 --> 00:44:55.309]  But there's no measurement.
[00:44:55.686 --> 00:44:59.668]  So what we have to look, we have the radioactive munitions, okay, which are horrible.
[00:44:59.888 --> 00:45:01.008]  Thoroughly used all over.
[00:45:01.148 --> 00:45:03.349]  But I mean, let's be clear though for those that are in denial.
[00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.011]  They can't believe their government would do something bad.
[00:45:06.291 --> 00:45:09.352]  Project Shad, all this stuff, the atomic soldiers, they knew.
[00:45:09.752 --> 00:45:16.095]  They knew, I mean, back in the forties and fifties, they took little kids and told them they were getting x-rays and killed them with radiation at bases.
[00:45:16.635 --> 00:45:22.838]  So stop denying folks the pre-documents that Dr. Rockey got a chance to see once he was the head of the program.
[00:45:23.198 --> 00:45:24.159]  They knew then too.
[00:45:26.202 --> 00:45:28.105]  What do you say to those that are in such denial?
[00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:45.266]  You know, the United States had given to Iraq, all the anthrax the United States had given to Iraq.
[00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:46.247]  You have to understand, the U.S.
[00:45:46.347 --> 00:45:47.887]  Army gave anthrax to Iraq.
[00:45:48.427 --> 00:45:50.208]  Okay, that's why we had to go to do the shots.
[00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:50.868]  U.S.
[00:45:50.948 --> 00:45:55.310]  Army, you samored Fort Detrick, Maryland, and I know the guys that sent it there, okay?
[00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:56.430]  They're friends of mine.
[00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:57.971]  I don't know how you define that anymore.
[00:45:57.991 --> 00:46:03.532]  Well, there was a Senate report that even after the war in 94, more shipments were made by the CDC to Saddam.
[00:46:03.733 --> 00:46:04.173]  That's correct.
[00:46:04.213 --> 00:46:08.854]  That's the Regal Commission report, and we did a movie for Showtime called Thanks for a Grateful Nation.
[00:46:09.294 --> 00:46:10.755]  That was all incredible work.
[00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.775]  But so we had a whole host of stuff.
[00:46:12.795 --> 00:46:15.516]  We blew the stuff up over there so Iraq had nothing left.
[00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:17.816]  You know, because we deliberately made the decision to blow it up.
[00:46:18.336 --> 00:46:20.757]  And Schwarzkopf, that's in his autobiography on page 390.
[00:46:21.537 --> 00:46:24.277]  So what we have today, now we've gone to Gulf War II, okay?
[00:46:25.318 --> 00:46:33.299]  And in the most recent casualty report, and I just got this on Thanksgiving Day, what a... Thanksgiving Day has not been good for me.
[00:46:33.679 --> 00:46:36.920]  I went to my second tour of Vietnam on Thanksgiving Day in 1969.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.500]  My grandma died that day.
[00:46:39.702 --> 00:46:46.007]  And then I went back to war for Gulf War One, Operation Desert Storm, on Thanksgiving Day of 1990.
[00:46:46.227 --> 00:46:48.689]  Okay?
[00:46:49.529 --> 00:46:55.674]  And then I got off active duty for the last time after I did all of this work for the government on Thanksgiving Day of 1995.
[00:46:56.695 --> 00:47:07.323]  And then on Thanksgiving Day, just the other day, I got the new casualty report from the Department of Veterans Affairs, giving me the numbers of what has really happened.
[00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:13.705]  The casualty data, ladies and gentlemen, for Gulf War II is not what you see on TV.
[00:47:14.646 --> 00:47:28.897]  The United States Army, and this is all published in Army Times, specifically states the operation Iraqi Freedom Casualties for March 19, 2003 through November 16, 2003 is the number of killed in action, KIA, is 2,846.
[00:47:28.937 --> 00:47:31.219]  The number wounded in action, WIA, is 21,678.
[00:47:38.604 --> 00:47:52.897]  However, when we go to the Griffis report, that's the VA actual report on casualties, it's now over 5,000 dead because thousands more come back under what's called disease and non-battle injury and then die.
[00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:54.919]  Yeah, they don't count those that die out of country.
[00:47:54.979 --> 00:47:55.940]  No, they don't count those.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.524]  And I mean, even when you look at the VA report, the new VA report says, you know, we don't count them.
[00:48:01.065 --> 00:48:02.326]  So what we have today
[00:48:03.086 --> 00:48:05.007]  And this is in the brand new report just released.
[00:48:05.187 --> 00:48:06.648]  I just got it on Thanksgiving Day.
[00:48:06.668 --> 00:48:09.089]  So Thanksgiving Day is not a good day for me in the military.
[00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.909]  You have to understand that.
[00:48:10.969 --> 00:48:22.855]  The number of casualties as of September 30th of 2006 for individuals that served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom that's in Iraq and Afghanistan is 205,097.
[00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:23.875]  21,000 have parasitic diseases
[00:48:31.127 --> 00:48:31.727]  1,584 have cancer.
[00:48:31.747 --> 00:48:32.868]  6,500 have benign cancer.
[00:48:32.888 --> 00:48:35.329]  36,000 have metabolic and endocrine problems.
[00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:36.429]  3,500 have serious blood problems.
[00:48:36.449 --> 00:48:40.391]  73,157 are mental disorders, PTSD and all this other stuff.
[00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:41.392]  61,000 have neurological problems.
[00:48:55.427 --> 00:49:09.019]  Now, the neurological problems are primarily due to uranium munitions exposures, and also the thorough misuse of pesticides, and the fact that our idiot kids, the soldiers, were wearing flea collars on their bodies in Iraq.
[00:49:09.439 --> 00:49:10.059]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.121]  Circulatory systems is 29,249.
[00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:16.596]  Respiratory problems.
[00:49:16.616 --> 00:49:20.777]  You have to understand, the DU, what we saw... Let me just stop you.
[00:49:20.817 --> 00:49:26.258]  I work for two vets and I don't plan to be an expert on this, but dogs don't sweat like humans do.
[00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:28.779]  It's on their fur and it's still highly toxic for them.
[00:49:29.339 --> 00:49:44.544]  Humans are not meant to wear pesticide collars because the poisons interact differently and we have massive absorption at hundreds of times, this is what vets have told me, one on top of his class from A&M, Jess Adkins, you absorb it through your skin.
[00:49:45.104 --> 00:49:45.824]  Absolutely correct.
[00:49:45.864 --> 00:49:47.885]  And we put all the warnings out and we tried to stop it.
[00:49:48.325 --> 00:49:53.826]  And Dr. Michael Kilpatrick, who's in charge of appointment medicine and all these guys, they just ignored us.
[00:49:54.446 --> 00:50:05.648]  The respiratory problems, you have to understand, with DU exposures, and that happened to myself and my team, the very first thing we see within 24 hours is very serious respiratory problems.
[00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:06.568]  We're at 36,190.
[00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:13.969]  The gastrointestinal GI problems, and again this isn't, you know, we're getting in the pesticides through our food and our water.
[00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:17.294]  Yeah, we're getting the DU into our system, the digestive system.
[00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:20.197]  The whole digestive system is at 63,002.
[00:50:20.357 --> 00:50:25.422]  One of my colonels just a couple weeks ago was at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
[00:50:25.462 --> 00:50:34.731]  He was madder than hell because he had the kids coming back and their whole gastrointestinal system, the esophagus through the stomach and everything, the intestines are just literally turning to mush.
[00:50:34.771 --> 00:50:38.495]  It's like jello and they break down and collapse and they bleed out and die.
[00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:40.233]  We've had that at Fort Bragg.
[00:50:40.293 --> 00:50:42.976]  We've had it happen right here over at the local VA hospital.
[00:50:42.996 --> 00:50:48.262]  Well, that's been all over the news that these healthy people come back and their guts just dissolve.
[00:50:48.643 --> 00:50:49.324]  Stay there, doctor.
[00:50:49.344 --> 00:50:58.455]  I want to talk about why the elite are doing this, why they don't care, and how we turn this around, how we stop the use instead of proliferating its use.
[00:51:04.844 --> 00:51:08.006]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.366 --> 00:51:10.308]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:18.333]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.013 --> 00:51:26.057]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:33.362]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:37.891]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.192 --> 00:51:41.854]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.154 --> 00:51:44.095]  It's an anthology of government crimes.

[00:52:54.316 --> 00:52:55.257]  We're good to go.
[00:53:20.336 --> 00:53:20.816]  I think so.
[00:53:37.389 --> 00:53:37.749]  I think so.
[00:54:10.487 --> 00:54:12.808]  This goes to the heart of everything.
[00:54:14.388 --> 00:54:17.089]  They knew back in the 40s it was a deadly weapon.
[00:54:18.229 --> 00:54:22.971]  They said, we can't use it, it's too deadly, it's too poisonous, the particulate, and then the radiation.
[00:54:24.873 --> 00:54:33.622]  And then they started, the Israelis started using it 20-30 years ago, then we started using it in the last 16 years, and now it's being served up into every weapon you can imagine.
[00:54:34.923 --> 00:54:42.952]  And the troops are coming back and dying, and people just laugh at us and say, I've got a sticker saying I support the troops and that's all I gotta do.
[00:54:43.532 --> 00:54:46.936]  And it's so insulting to the troops I talk to that do know what's happening.
[00:54:48.295 --> 00:54:49.636]  And by the way, the secret is out.
[00:54:49.876 --> 00:54:51.998]  Most of the military is now waking up to this.
[00:54:52.579 --> 00:54:56.703]  So the military is now having to go below the test standards they ever had.
[00:54:56.723 --> 00:55:00.306]  Something like 16% are now below standard.
[00:55:00.366 --> 00:55:02.268]  Literally, low-grade morons.
[00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:06.452]  And so, this is just... Dr. Doug Rocky, why?
[00:55:06.472 --> 00:55:07.653]  I mean, you've worked inside this.
[00:55:07.893 --> 00:55:09.595]  Why does the establishment not care?
[00:55:09.655 --> 00:55:11.717]  I mean, I know you're going to say, well, it's a good weapon.
[00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:23.781]  But yeah, I mean, if it's a good rifle that shoots your enemy but fires a bullet back into you, I mean, I understand why the guys on the ground go ahead and use it, because they don't know the full ramifications, but why did the establishment decide to do this?
[00:55:24.102 --> 00:55:29.264]  I guess they just think they've got such media control, and they'll just say, be patriotic, it's good for you?
[00:55:29.284 --> 00:55:31.606]  I mean, how are they able to continue this?
[00:55:31.666 --> 00:55:33.407]  How are they able to do the Tuskegee Experiment?
[00:55:33.687 --> 00:55:36.008]  How are they able to nerve gas their own troops and murder them?
[00:55:36.488 --> 00:55:38.690]  And how do they find doctors that'll do that?
[00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.911]  How do they, I mean, what is this?
[00:55:42.709 --> 00:55:44.591]  It's blind following the leader.
[00:55:44.691 --> 00:55:52.897]  I mean, you know, one thing that I had to come to grips with was the fact that once I started learning and seeing what was happening, I put programs together to do this, and then I said, no more.
[00:55:53.738 --> 00:55:54.018]  Okay?
[00:55:54.658 --> 00:55:55.819]  You've got so many individuals.
[00:55:55.859 --> 00:55:57.300]  First off, you're absolutely correct.
[00:55:57.501 --> 00:56:02.785]  We've got less than 80% have a high school degree that have gone into the Army recently.
[00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:07.728]  And when you go into the enlistment, you have what's called the enlistment test.
[00:56:07.768 --> 00:56:08.449]  It's an ASVAB.
[00:56:09.832 --> 00:56:15.056]  The proportion that score less than 50% at the bottom two quartiles is incredibly high.
[00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:16.277]  Okay?
[00:56:16.737 --> 00:56:21.080]  And so, you know, most of the time, you know, 75% and below on the ASVAB would be considered a moron.
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.042]  Well, the majority of enlistees are at 50% and lower.
[00:56:25.083 --> 00:56:29.506]  So, I mean, you know, we had a, what, a Congress, a Senator or somebody got in all in trouble because he stated the truth.
[00:56:30.446 --> 00:56:32.508]  Well, these guys don't have the knowledge, then they're lied to.
[00:56:32.548 --> 00:56:33.829]  Then these commanders lie to them.
[00:56:33.869 --> 00:56:37.451]  And it's hard to sustain the use of this stuff and avoid all liability.
[00:56:38.135 --> 00:56:39.036]  Uh, they don't teach it.
[00:56:39.277 --> 00:56:41.479]  I mean, the casualty rate is astronomical.
[00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:42.680]  Look at the fundamentals.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:49.408]  You know, when we were in Vietnam and all the stuff in the military, what we learned is when you're going to do an insertion or attack, you get dispersal, okay?
[00:56:50.489 --> 00:56:55.875]  You don't run up in a cluster of ducks and get blowed up all together where you're so close you got your head up the other guy's butt.
[00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:57.887]  You're seeing that all over the place.
[00:56:57.907 --> 00:56:58.849]  Well, that's the other thing.
[00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:00.751]  Why are they using SWAT tactics?
[00:57:00.771 --> 00:57:02.233]  Because they saw it on TV.
[00:57:02.634 --> 00:57:08.081]  Well, the military uses, they picked up the SWAT tactics because you've got to watch on TV and play the games.
[00:57:08.521 --> 00:57:11.946]  And then the police have picked up this stuff and the police are getting killed in drug raids.
[00:57:12.567 --> 00:57:14.189]  Because they're using these stupid tactics.
[00:57:14.935 --> 00:57:23.806]  And we keep doing training and education, trying to train the SWATs, because you have to understand, I know I train the military, I've been training the police, and just, you know, like our team gets called to do everything.
[00:57:23.866 --> 00:57:25.849]  It's like, hey guys, you know what you're doing, help us.
[00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:27.271]  But then they don't do it.
[00:57:27.972 --> 00:57:28.913]  It's real simple.
[00:57:29.525 --> 00:57:32.168]  Well, who started that thing where they stack up and go in a building?
[00:57:32.188 --> 00:57:33.269]  Because it's ridiculous.
[00:57:33.569 --> 00:57:34.010]  I don't know.
[00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:39.175]  It started with this nonsense in Gulf War II and the other ones and everything.
[00:57:39.275 --> 00:57:40.917]  Then the SWAT picked it up.
[00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.739]  It makes me sad.
[00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:49.566]  I had a discussion today about that with another individual in our community who was sick of it, seeing the whole thing happen too.
[00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.788]  I guess the whole thing would have to come back.
[00:57:52.765 --> 00:58:01.794]  First off, we have gone into all these wars without justification, where neither Afghanistan or Iraq posed any offensive military threat whatsoever.
[00:58:02.375 --> 00:58:04.457]  They did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:58:04.497 --> 00:58:07.119]  The battle plans were put together in the Clinton administration.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:15.668]  Gulf War II, we started planning that in 1995, and Afghanistan came from a congressional directive from February 12th of 1998.
[00:58:17.322 --> 00:58:20.024]  And so what's happening, we're getting all this stuff and it's happening.
[00:58:20.384 --> 00:58:22.906]  So we got over a half a million casualties.
[00:58:23.706 --> 00:58:26.328]  Thousands are dead for no reason whatsoever.
[00:58:26.688 --> 00:58:29.850]  You got the bumper stickers out there, support the truth, love America.
[00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:35.834]  But when I ask those individuals to take a sick or injured vet to the VA hospital or the hospital for medical care, they walk away.
[00:58:36.354 --> 00:58:39.996]  When you ask them to call their congressman and yell and scream about... Stay there, we got a break.
[00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:41.057]  I gotta start this for the third hour.
[00:58:41.877 --> 00:58:46.979]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.831 --> 00:58:58.472]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.133 --> 00:59:00.174]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.895 --> 00:59:02.016]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.657 --> 00:59:03.478]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.239 --> 00:59:05.120]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.986 --> 00:59:14.070]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:21.241]  Well, there's been a ruling that the government's moving to ban all file sharing on the Internet.
[00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:23.841]  This will be the death knell to much of the Internet.
[00:59:23.861 --> 00:59:25.822]  We'll be discussing it in 30 minutes with Paul Watson.
[00:59:26.282 --> 00:59:29.082]  I know we've had loaded phones, and I apologize to all of you that have been holding.
[00:59:29.702 --> 00:59:33.263]  But I'm only taking calls in this next 20-30 minutes while Doug Rockey can stay with us.
[00:59:33.383 --> 00:59:40.904]  Dr. Rockey, on the subject of depleted uranium, Project Shad, the police state, all of it, you know, those subjects, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:40.924 --> 00:59:42.464]  So I just cleared the lines.
[00:59:47.105 --> 00:59:49.227]  In the interest of our guests, we can stay on topic.
[00:59:49.247 --> 00:59:55.394]  We normally have open phones on any topic, but specifically right now, it's about the dead troops, what's happening, the cover-up.
[00:59:55.754 --> 01:00:08.448]  Dr. Rockey, getting back to this central point, DU is such a horrible thing that's happened, but it's usage, it's widespread adoption and usages, but it's another signpost, another
[01:00:10.009 --> 01:00:16.015]  Caught red-handed example of where the elite thinks so little of us that they know it's a deadly weapon since the 40s.
[01:00:16.515 --> 01:00:18.557]  They implement its use in 1991.
[01:00:19.298 --> 01:00:21.760]  They use it all over the globe on three continents.
[01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:24.283]  Well, I guess five continents actually.
[01:00:25.464 --> 01:00:28.427]  But heavy wartime use in three continents.
[01:00:28.907 --> 01:00:30.729]  They know it's killing the troops.
[01:00:30.889 --> 01:00:32.471]  They're coming back and dying in mass.
[01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:37.970]  And, again, it just goes to the fact of why do people serve this government?
[01:00:38.311 --> 01:00:39.432]  This is not our government.
[01:00:39.712 --> 01:00:50.642]  And for people that can't believe the government would be involved in 9-11, 3,000 lives means nothing to these cold-blooded sociopaths that these multinational corporations that control our government.
[01:00:50.982 --> 01:00:52.383]  Dr. Rockey, you want to speak to that?
[01:00:52.403 --> 01:00:54.425]  It's scary.
[01:00:54.505 --> 01:00:59.710]  You know, you have to understand, there are a lot of individuals in the military and special operations that kill and destroy without a heartbeat.
[01:01:00.529 --> 01:01:06.252]  The fact that they'll, you know, some Air Force pilot that's nutty will go out there and shoot one of our airliners out of the sky is irrelevant.
[01:01:07.152 --> 01:01:09.953]  The fact that we'll go out over and do everything we're doing is irrelevant.
[01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:15.056]  Because they take this mindset, and in the military we call it hoo-ha, okay?
[01:01:15.456 --> 01:01:22.339]  And it's really hard to describe, but what it means is we're just going to go do it no matter what, and I'm going to disregard all the health and environmental effects.
[01:01:22.719 --> 01:01:24.660]  I'm going to disregard what's right and what's wrong.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.322]  For example, it was on the news this morning, it was on the news last night.
[01:01:28.968 --> 01:01:30.969]  In Iraq, in Baghdad, they're showing U.S.
[01:01:31.009 --> 01:01:37.433]  troops literally going and storming and breaking down a house with machine guns ready or whatever and going after families.
[01:01:38.633 --> 01:01:41.155]  I mean, Jesus, that's just totally wrong.
[01:01:42.075 --> 01:01:42.916]  It's absolutely wrong.
[01:01:42.936 --> 01:01:44.817]  And then the snipers, they break about the snipers.
[01:01:44.857 --> 01:01:52.061]  Well, we're going to be out here at, you know, 3,000 feet and we'll pick this guy off, you know, just because they can and they want to.
[01:01:53.061 --> 01:02:06.070]  And then we have, as a consequence, all of a sudden these kids realize, because most of them, you know, they're raised, we have to understand, they have the right half of the brain, which in what we talked about in military medicine and all the responses, the right half of the brain says this is what's right.
[01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:09.052]  The left half of the brain is where they're operating at.
[01:02:09.612 --> 01:02:15.816]  And then all of a sudden it crashes together and that's why we've got probably close to a hundred thousand, you know, there are nut cases today.
[01:02:16.597 --> 01:02:18.558]  These kids are destroyed for life.
[01:02:18.618 --> 01:02:20.079]  When you go to the war,
[01:02:20.891 --> 01:02:26.013]  And you get involved with all the materials we use, the munitions we use, and the destruction we wrought.
[01:02:26.754 --> 01:02:27.694]  You don't come back.
[01:02:29.215 --> 01:02:33.437]  Monday, yesterday, yeah, today, Tuesday, Wednesday, I've lost all track of time.
[01:02:33.977 --> 01:02:35.117]  Monday I had a father call.
[01:02:35.658 --> 01:02:36.458]  We were working with him.
[01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:39.519]  His son was a cannon cocker, Fort Seal artillery, okay?
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.301]  The kid's having four and five seizures a day.
[01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:43.581]  There's nothing left of him.
[01:02:43.881 --> 01:02:45.002]  He can't get medical care.
[01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:50.554]  One of the things we find at the VA is you have to wait months and months and months to get an appointment.
[01:02:50.754 --> 01:02:52.335]  Was he firing DEU munitions?
[01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:57.459]  We're still trying to figure out what it was, but basically it looks like it's a whole combination.
[01:02:57.479 --> 01:02:59.861]  Some of the chemical munitions, some of the biological munitions.
[01:03:00.681 --> 01:03:02.562]  Oh, they're using chemical munitions?
[01:03:02.603 --> 01:03:03.443]  They're using chemicals?
[01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:04.464]  Oh yeah, sure.
[01:03:04.604 --> 01:03:04.944]  Why not?
[01:03:08.226 --> 01:03:10.108]  I mean, you know, that's so thoroughly confirmed.
[01:03:10.128 --> 01:03:14.871]  The Army thoroughly confirmed that at Fallujah, and the Israelis have acknowledged that they did it in Lebanon.
[01:03:15.615 --> 01:03:16.436]  It's thoroughly confirmed.
[01:03:17.457 --> 01:03:23.542]  You know, again, why would Israel use all that DU right by their border, knowing the winds blow right into their country?
[01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:24.763]  Well, it's stupidity.
[01:03:24.803 --> 01:03:31.188]  I mean, you know, when all this started happening, building up, we contacted Omar, who's the Prime Minister, and said, you better take care of this, stop this, and do this.
[01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:31.869]  But it didn't matter.
[01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:32.309]  They did it.
[01:03:32.938 --> 01:03:43.665]  We have to understand the arrogance today, the total disregard for health and the environment, the destruction we wrought, has turned into a nightmare, and the casualties are just astronomical.
[01:03:43.965 --> 01:03:48.929]  They're not just KIA and WIA, they're DNBI, disease and non-battle injury.
[01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:49.689]  Way over 200,000.
[01:03:49.729 --> 01:03:51.510]  We gotta break, gotta break again.
[01:03:56.588 --> 01:03:59.749]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:02.049]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.409 --> 01:04:10.071]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:17.792]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.193 --> 01:04:25.054]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:29.624]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.924 --> 01:04:33.445]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.885 --> 01:04:35.806]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.146 --> 01:04:40.067]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.184]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:56.404 --> 01:05:58.446]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:06:05.914 --> 01:06:14.502]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:06:54.614 --> 01:07:00.659]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.302]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.743 --> 01:07:09.627]  Dr. Doug Rockey will be with us for another 22 minutes and we've got Paul Watson joining us with some incredible news.
[01:07:12.369 --> 01:07:14.271]  Dr. Doug Rockey, before we go to these calls,
[01:07:17.842 --> 01:07:38.338]  What percentage of the troops do you think now, who literally aren't the offspring of crack babies, and I'm sorry to have to say that, it's the truth, who just can't really even comprehend, what percentage of the military that you talk to now, or military families, are they starting to finally read the literature from the Pentagon itself?
[01:07:39.048 --> 01:07:43.931]  And are they starting to discover that they've been totally lied to and totally betrayed?
[01:07:43.971 --> 01:07:47.552]  I mean, this makes Agent Orange look like orange juice.
[01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:48.973]  I mean, this makes it look nutritious.
[01:07:49.914 --> 01:07:50.574]  Yeah, it does.
[01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.215]  I mean, it's more and more every day.
[01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:57.657]  The phone calls never cease to stop getting stopped at school, get stopped on a street, get stopped in church.
[01:07:58.118 --> 01:07:59.118]  It doesn't matter where I am.
[01:07:59.178 --> 01:08:04.581]  My kids get stopped and they're asked to, you know, through them to get me to intervene to help.
[01:08:05.636 --> 01:08:07.457]  E-mails, phone calls, it never stops.
[01:08:07.537 --> 01:08:08.638]  More and more are becoming awake.
[01:08:08.658 --> 01:08:24.867]  But you have to understand, the leaders in the military and the commanders have deliberately and willfully withheld knowledge of the Army regulation and all the training materials, the common task training, all the technical manuals, all the medical orders, deliberately withheld those from the troops, deliberately withheld them from the families.
[01:08:25.608 --> 01:08:34.513]  And as far as the physicians at the VA or in the Army medical community, even though we have all the directives and the training out there, and I helped put this together,
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.622]  You know, with the other individuals and disseminate it on out to other individuals specifically responsible for the medical.
[01:08:40.562 --> 01:08:41.043]  They don't do it.
[01:08:41.943 --> 01:08:43.243]  They just thoroughly disregard it.
[01:08:43.684 --> 01:08:53.628]  When we get to the, you know, the exposure of uranium munitions in combat in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the technical bull in very specific ways tells you exactly how to decomm and how to do medical care.
[01:08:54.528 --> 01:08:56.929]  The orders from the Surgeon General give you specific directives.
[01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:58.390]  And it doesn't happen.
[01:08:59.381 --> 01:09:01.142]  It absolutely doesn't matter.
[01:09:01.182 --> 01:09:11.888]  So, bottom line, they shouldn't be using the munition, but even if they did, they could then do the proper decon procedures and massively reduce the danger?
[01:09:12.368 --> 01:09:18.511]  Well, you know, if you do the cleanup and the decon procedures, you can reduce some of the danger, mitigate it, but you're never going to resolve it.
[01:09:19.032 --> 01:09:22.013]  As far as the medical care and treatment, the reason why the U.S.
[01:09:22.053 --> 01:09:28.557]  Army orders mandates a radio bioassay within 24 hours of exposure, not months or years later or never,
[01:09:29.059 --> 01:09:30.661]  But within 24 hours of exposure.
[01:09:30.681 --> 01:09:39.230]  And this is the written directive from October of 1993 when I got the medical directive out because we were going to use uranium munitions in a place called Somalia.
[01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:40.271]  Okay?
[01:09:40.651 --> 01:09:41.652]  And I worked like mad.
[01:09:41.672 --> 01:09:43.154]  We got the medical directive out then.
[01:09:44.495 --> 01:09:51.743]  So what they do is they don't do it and they deliberately delay the testing so there's no correlation between a verified exposure and adverse health effects.
[01:09:52.478 --> 01:10:00.381]  What's happened is medical personnel all over, with the contamination, they get exposed to all this cross-transfer contamination because they don't follow.
[01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:02.882]  Yeah, these guys are covered with a DU dust when they bring them in.
[01:10:02.902 --> 01:10:13.125]  They have pesticides and everything else, and then it gets transferred, and then the troops go down, and what's happened, I've had so many doctors and nurses had to quit medicine because they could no longer function.
[01:10:14.462 --> 01:10:16.963]  I want to talk a little bit about Project Shad and then take some calls.
[01:10:16.983 --> 01:10:20.564]  A whole other subject, but it's along the same lines, same parallels, same cancer.
[01:10:38.027 --> 01:10:41.470]  What specifically from the medical literature does DU cause?
[01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.752]  Well, what we have is the respiratory problems, the first thing we saw.
[01:10:44.813 --> 01:10:45.974]  Then we have all the rashes.
[01:10:46.214 --> 01:10:51.719]  Now, I got open sores and bleeding right now as I've had from 24 hours after we started this in 91.
[01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:53.200]  I mean, they're open and bleeding right now.
[01:10:54.081 --> 01:11:00.606]  Okay, then we start seeing the calcified granulomas, the destruction of the lungs due to the particulates, but primarily the radiation.
[01:11:01.187 --> 01:11:02.868]  Then we start seeing all the kidney problems.
[01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:04.650]  Then we start seeing the neurological problems.
[01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:09.192]  And then we have the internal respiration because the cells can no longer carry oxygen.
[01:11:09.212 --> 01:11:09.952]  They're all destroyed.
[01:11:10.112 --> 01:11:12.893]  So it hits delicate tissues first?
[01:11:13.213 --> 01:11:13.913]  It hits everything.
[01:11:14.093 --> 01:11:14.774]  It hits everything.
[01:11:14.834 --> 01:11:17.415]  And then what happened, you know, the cancers were the least of the worries.
[01:11:17.455 --> 01:11:19.095]  I mean, we had incredible numbers of cancers.
[01:11:20.096 --> 01:11:22.517]  You know, on my team, the cancer was within nine months.
[01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:29.099]  And then what's scary for Gulf War II, another guy came back out of the famed 442nd out of New York.
[01:11:29.139 --> 01:11:33.301]  This was the cream of the crop of New York police and fire that got activated for Gulf War II.
[01:11:34.434 --> 01:11:38.955]  You know, within the same incubation period, same time, same location, same tumor in the throat.
[01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.095]  It's one of my guys.
[01:11:40.215 --> 01:11:40.695]  Identical.
[01:11:41.415 --> 01:11:41.715]  Absolutely.
[01:11:41.735 --> 01:11:42.495]  Everything identical.
[01:11:43.056 --> 01:11:49.437]  In fact, then several big newspapers paid to have prestigious medical institutions do the scans of the lungs.
[01:11:49.477 --> 01:11:50.857]  Again, I'm not telling the doctor anything.
[01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:52.197]  I'm just bringing this up for listeners.
[01:11:52.597 --> 01:11:53.397]  And what did they find?
[01:11:53.737 --> 01:11:55.258]  They found all of the problems, but the U.S.
[01:11:55.318 --> 01:12:00.499]  Army had refused to do the testing, and the guys at Walter Reed and Walter Wonderful, which is a... forget it.
[01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:06.409]  They just refuse to do it, and we got involved with the arguments of them, and we call all the time.
[01:12:06.829 --> 01:12:10.895]  I mean, I usually call the Secretary of Defense office, Dr. Mike, about two or three times a week.
[01:12:11.571 --> 01:12:12.631]  They never return phone calls.
[01:12:12.671 --> 01:12:13.572]  They don't help anybody.
[01:12:13.632 --> 01:12:15.312]  I just, you know, okay, here's what we're doing.
[01:12:15.493 --> 01:12:17.813]  Meanwhile, they're off living in big, fancy townhouses.
[01:12:17.853 --> 01:12:18.734]  They're playing golf.
[01:12:19.174 --> 01:12:21.395]  They got all their fancy prostitutes in D.C.
[01:12:21.415 --> 01:12:26.517]  I mean, it seems like the elite's always been corrupt and evil, but it seems like they just don't, they've just gone wild.
[01:12:26.577 --> 01:12:32.619]  Almost, well, we see this in criminology, where psychopaths start getting more and more reckless, trying to get caught.
[01:12:32.959 --> 01:12:42.343]  Yeah, but even the unit commanders that are fools that are using all these weapons and send the troops out without the proper training, equipment, and education, and then medical care afterward, they're fools.
[01:12:43.083 --> 01:12:44.204]  I mean, you know, I have to understand.
[01:12:44.244 --> 01:12:51.387]  I'm, you know, retired now, but it's like, what, 39, 40 years ago, and anybody that listened to military today, you're crazy.
[01:12:51.887 --> 01:12:56.249]  You need to do, seem to be a psychological evaluation, because you're going to be abandoned.
[01:12:56.269 --> 01:12:58.870]  You're going to be one of these half-million casualties we already have.
[01:12:59.352 --> 01:13:17.131]  What's going to happen as the people, and they are learning about this, and they can't even get the poor, you know, kids to get involved anymore, they're going to have to have a draft, which, it didn't just Rangel pushing this, the Republicans have a bill, they've set up the draft boards again, Clinton, when he left office, had a study put together saying they needed a draft.
[01:13:17.472 --> 01:13:19.334]  What do you see happening with the national conscription?
[01:13:20.015 --> 01:13:21.256]  Well, it's a given.
[01:13:21.556 --> 01:13:24.939]  But the thing that's more scary, they upped the basic enlistment age to 42.
[01:13:25.439 --> 01:13:36.768]  So the Army doctors, you know, the generals that I work with, and the colonels, the top docs in the military, they're no longer practicing pediatric medicine and basic training, they're practicing geriatric medicine and basic training.
[01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:39.330]  It's incredible.
[01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:47.596]  And then you look at the thing, they've got to pay all these guys incredible enlistment bonuses, and they go over and they get this money, and they come back and they find out their life has ended.
[01:13:48.016 --> 01:13:49.217]  They're one of these casualties.
[01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:55.289]  You have to understand, if you get a 40% disability like I got from the VA, that's a grand total of $536 a month.
[01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:56.752]  Try living on that.
[01:13:57.012 --> 01:13:58.034]  By the way, I want to say this.
[01:13:59.116 --> 01:14:04.298]  You know, here on this show, I sell videos, I sell books, I have to pay my employees, we have to fund ourselves.
[01:14:04.758 --> 01:14:08.939]  I always ask you for years, hey, do you have a book?
[01:14:09.019 --> 01:14:09.900]  Can we donate to you?
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.400]  Can we help you?
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.540]  And you're like, no, no, no.
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:20.864]  Just call Congress, get people involved, and then here you are, after decades of service in the military, basically kicked to the curb and you're asking for nothing.
[01:14:20.904 --> 01:14:22.064]  I just want to commend you, doctor.
[01:14:23.194 --> 01:14:31.500]  Shifting gears again to Project Shed, for those that don't know what it is, just in a brief nutshell, tell folks about it and then you said you were involved in some of the cleanup of this.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.023]  This is admitted, declassified, this is not debatable, this is what the government does to our troops.
[01:14:37.403 --> 01:14:41.486]  I've interviewed some of those that survived, I've talked to the family members of those that have friends that died.
[01:14:41.506 --> 01:14:43.768]  I mean, this is the mindset of the government.
[01:14:43.788 --> 01:14:44.228]  Tell folks.
[01:14:45.054 --> 01:14:56.283]  Well, Project SHAD that I know of goes back to the 1950s, and in the 1950s and throughout and continued on, Project SHAD is the deliberate use of chemical and biological and radiological munitions on U.S.
[01:14:56.323 --> 01:15:06.231]  military personnel, but it's also deliberate use on civilian personnel to find out what the effects are of the chemical, biological and radiological munitions.
[01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:10.789]  For example, I mean, extensive use with nerve agents all over the place.
[01:15:10.829 --> 01:15:11.409]  It continued.
[01:15:11.909 --> 01:15:15.451]  I talked to individuals that were involved in this up at Edgewood in Maryland.
[01:15:15.572 --> 01:15:17.933]  That's Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, that they're sick and abandoned.
[01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:21.775]  You know, both military and civilians, and that continues to continue on.
[01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:24.897]  We've had all this use throughout all over.
[01:15:25.978 --> 01:15:28.300]  Port Greely in Alaska was a horrible thing.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.182]  They used Tularemia, that's rabbit, that's horrible biological.
[01:15:32.842 --> 01:15:33.283]  They used
[01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:46.382]  What VX and Sarin and they also used strontium-90 radiologic material deliberately released and that spread not only around that area but got into the livestock and the wildlife all the way over into Canada where we've had horrible health effects.
[01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:51.465]  Now let's be specific here including Plum Island off New York and Lyme disease.
[01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:53.306]  Okay let's go to Plum Island.
[01:15:53.326 --> 01:15:59.969]  When you go to the Regal Commission report one of the last items on the Regal Commission report that was put out came from Plum Island.
[01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:02.491]  That's West Nile virus.
[01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:09.273]  West Nile Virus was an accidental release at Plum Island that got into Central Park and then spread across the nation.
[01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:18.838]  Now, according to the BBC, projects shared between the U.S.
[01:16:18.858 --> 01:16:21.699]  and England went from the early 50s through 87 and
[01:16:26.216 --> 01:16:26.677]  Exactly.
[01:16:26.737 --> 01:16:28.979]  It included releasing an unknown.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:29.780]  They won't tell us.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.742]  Biological agent in the New York subway.
[01:16:32.403 --> 01:16:35.546]  Deaths resulted, but they say details are classified.
[01:16:36.067 --> 01:16:40.632]  I mean, we got a government, folks, that kills people on the New York subway, and then they're telling you
[01:16:42.196 --> 01:16:43.256]  Give up all your rights!
[01:16:43.377 --> 01:16:52.600]  Shadowy Al-Qaeda is going to get you any minute, and there are thousands of examples of partially and totally declassified admissions of where... I mean, I want to be specific.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.181]  It isn't like they accidentally tested some nerve gas on people and it killed them.
[01:16:56.582 --> 01:17:02.844]  They would take young British and military troops, tell them you're going to get a three-day leave if you go in this chamber and sign this waiver.
[01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.225]  They sign it, they walk in, they murder them.
[01:17:05.545 --> 01:17:07.026]  Other cases, they don't sign any waiver.
[01:17:07.046 --> 01:17:07.866]  You put them on a ship,
[01:17:08.346 --> 01:17:12.712]  They fly over and spray the ship, everybody gets sick, some people die a week later, some five years later.
[01:17:13.172 --> 01:17:14.814]  I mean, what is going on here?
[01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:23.725]  Well, one of the, you know, with all of the casualties filed a class action lawsuit, and the federal court just ruled that the military did not have to release the information.
[01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:27.830]  In preparation for Gulf War II, Operation Iraqi Freedom,
[01:17:28.548 --> 01:17:31.611]  Our medical command was working at Camp Tracy, California.
[01:17:31.771 --> 01:17:38.016]  It's about 90 miles to the straight east of San Francisco, just over the valley past where all the windmills are.
[01:17:38.556 --> 01:17:42.039]  And they deliberately sprayed them with pesticides, with nerve agents.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.161]  And they're sick and dying.
[01:17:44.681 --> 01:17:45.882]  So many got sick out of the unit.
[01:17:45.902 --> 01:17:47.904]  They didn't have the capability with military medicine.
[01:17:48.344 --> 01:17:50.786]  They had to transport them to San Francisco for medical care.
[01:17:51.407 --> 01:17:52.228]  And they're all down.
[01:17:52.248 --> 01:17:56.291]  It was a deliberate act, a deliberate willful act,
[01:17:56.917 --> 01:17:57.977]  And we're still fighting with it.
[01:17:58.077 --> 01:18:01.138]  But again, who thinks this stuff up?
[01:18:01.938 --> 01:18:02.699]  We know there's U.S.
[01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:15.142]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B, where they say, for experimental reasons, they can use any chemical, biological weapon they want on the American people, not just the military.
[01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:25.605]  Yeah, and then again, both President Bush I, Bill Clinton, and President Bush II all signed executive orders, presidential decision directives, dissolving everybody's responsibility.
[01:18:26.272 --> 01:18:30.493]  I mean, it's just, it's scary because this is reality.
[01:18:31.093 --> 01:18:36.655]  And when you run into reality when you've been involved in the programs and you see what it is, it shakes you up.
[01:18:37.095 --> 01:18:46.877]  And most people don't want to acknowledge it because all of the beliefs, the foundations, what they believed in their life is rested on, goes back to the government leaders will take care of you, they won't harm you, they won't do this to you.
[01:18:47.238 --> 01:18:49.118]  And if you go to combat, you'll get medical care.
[01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:51.519]  And guess what, ladies and gentlemen, it's a thorough lie.
[01:18:51.879 --> 01:18:52.479]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.426 --> 01:18:56.828]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:18:57.348 --> 01:19:00.670]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:03.992]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:19:04.252 --> 01:19:10.636]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:19:10.696 --> 01:19:15.119]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:19:15.339 --> 01:19:19.702]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:19:19.862 --> 01:19:22.464]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:19:22.504 --> 01:19:25.266]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:19:25.726 --> 01:19:28.268]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:19:28.308 --> 01:19:32.571]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:19:32.611 --> 01:19:33.452]  Treasury bonds.
[01:19:33.732 --> 01:19:38.355]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:19:38.535 --> 01:19:40.176]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:19:40.196 --> 01:19:41.776]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:19:53.513 --> 01:19:58.737]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:06.963]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:20:07.223 --> 01:20:14.268]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:20:14.428 --> 01:20:15.369]  We're good to go!
[01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.770]  I think?
[01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:57.210]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:57.430 --> 01:21:09.721]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:10.141 --> 01:21:10.541]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:16.166]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:18.769]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:21.690]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:21.730 --> 01:21:24.571]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:24.691 --> 01:21:30.713]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:21:31.134 --> 01:21:34.495]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:21:34.575 --> 01:21:40.897]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:21:41.477 --> 01:21:45.480]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:48.163]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.563 --> 01:21:49.364]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:55.709]  Send your loved one a timeless treasure this Christmas.
[01:21:56.069 --> 01:21:58.851]  Get the book, The Magic Christmas Reindeer Bell.
[01:21:59.352 --> 01:22:01.714]  Set in a simpler time in rural America.
[01:22:07.449 --> 01:22:08.430]  We're good to go.
[01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:28.185]  Federal agents!
[01:22:28.205 --> 01:22:28.646]  We are armed!
[01:22:56.716 --> 01:23:00.858]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:04.140]  Would you stand up but you knew?
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.521]  Would you turn away too?
[01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:12.003]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:23:12.063 --> 01:23:14.044]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[01:23:15.013 --> 01:23:21.997]  Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:23:22.037 --> 01:23:24.338]  Let's play that song in its entirety on the other side.
[01:23:24.398 --> 01:23:25.119]  It's a good song.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:27.720]  By good old Paris.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.801]  Let's go to John in Georgia.
[01:23:29.821 --> 01:23:35.304]  You're on the air with Dr. Doug Rockey, who we commend for joining us today and his great courage exposing all this from the inside.
[01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.004]  Go ahead, John.
[01:23:36.985 --> 01:23:37.565]  Yes, Alex.
[01:23:37.865 --> 01:23:41.167]  I just want to say everything I've heard your guest say is true.
[01:23:41.227 --> 01:23:42.448]  I'm a disabled veteran.
[01:23:43.161 --> 01:23:56.406]  I have a number of spinal cord injuries, and I joined September 17, 2001, and they've got me at 20%, which is $219 a month to support my family on.
[01:23:56.927 --> 01:24:01.789]  I've had numerous civilian doctors say I should already be paralyzed.
[01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:10.052]  But what concerns me the most other than that, a number of guys from my unit, we all have intestinal problems.
[01:24:10.272 --> 01:24:12.613]  I've just been hospitalized for about a week.
[01:24:13.323 --> 01:24:15.324]  And nobody knows what's wrong.
[01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:17.265]  Our intestines are shutting down.
[01:24:17.305 --> 01:24:18.726]  We're passing blood in our stool.
[01:24:18.946 --> 01:24:23.348]  And I've had other guests on with the numbers, and even the mainstream media has admitted the VA has plenty of money.
[01:24:23.788 --> 01:24:28.130]  As a course of action, they just decide to not give it to the troops.
[01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:29.591]  Dr. Rocky?
[01:24:33.052 --> 01:24:34.213]  I've got to be brutally frank.
[01:24:35.994 --> 01:24:40.716]  One thing that we've learned with all of this stuff, and all of our work, all the years in environmental exposures and exposures,
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.141]  There ain't no effective treatment.
[01:24:44.762 --> 01:24:49.166]  The only thing we can do is stabilize and stabilize and optimize the remaining function.
[01:24:49.206 --> 01:24:50.487]  In diet, no more caffeine.
[01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.088]  It's that simple.
[01:24:53.769 --> 01:25:00.475]  We have learned from our work and our research work with the Dallas, down in Dallas, the super experts on this stuff and all this stuff.
[01:25:00.875 --> 01:25:03.917]  Your diet can absolutely help.
[01:25:04.037 --> 01:25:08.401]  I mean, when you make the idea of all these prepared foods with all these preservatives, those are gone.
[01:25:09.395 --> 01:25:18.817]  So he's telling you that, does what he's having happen to him, because you talked about bones fusing, you talked about the stomach problems, does that sound like DU or something else?
[01:25:18.837 --> 01:25:20.077]  It's a whole combination of everything.
[01:25:20.097 --> 01:25:22.397]  You have to remember, even with DU, we don't just have DU.
[01:25:22.457 --> 01:25:23.698]  We have all the other stuff there.
[01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.538]  We have all the unexploded arms, bioproducts.
[01:25:25.878 --> 01:25:28.218]  We've got the biologicals from blowing up people and everything else.
[01:25:28.258 --> 01:25:29.739]  We've got the hazardous materials from what we blew up.
[01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:31.899]  War is a toxic nightmare.
[01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:37.740]  Now we know from our direct work, certain things happen directly with DU.
[01:25:38.573 --> 01:25:40.574]  We know certain things happen with pesticide.
[01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:46.817]  And what you're doing, you've got a synergistic cocktail that's absolutely trashed a half a million of our sons and daughters.
[01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:52.040]  Sir, how many of your friends or people you were in with, your war buddies, how many of them are sick?
[01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:53.821]  John?
[01:25:54.681 --> 01:26:01.585]  I keep in contact with about five of them, and I know of two of them right now are having the exact same symptoms I have, which are pretty much
[01:26:02.412 --> 01:26:08.917]  Our spines are developing spurs and fusing together and herniating and we're just, our intestines are shutting down.
[01:26:09.558 --> 01:26:12.400]  And then on top of that, you know, memory loss is just weird.
[01:26:13.681 --> 01:26:15.722]  The memory loss happens from a whole combination.
[01:26:15.762 --> 01:26:26.911]  What's happened is the poor perfusion of the oxygen, the poor nutrition, and then the inability of the cells to remove all of the toxic byproducts that happen, you know, in the cells during the metabolic process.
[01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.692]  Where were you deployed?
[01:26:28.712 --> 01:26:30.494]  I mean, what did you work in and around?
[01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:33.690]  See, I was never deployed.
[01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:35.910]  I was just in infantry school as a machine gunner.
[01:26:37.051 --> 01:26:37.631]  Fort Benning?
[01:26:38.611 --> 01:26:45.053]  No, I was in the Marine Corps, in Lejeune.
[01:26:45.573 --> 01:26:49.054]  Camp Lejeune has got so much misuse of pesticides to make your head spin.
[01:26:49.754 --> 01:26:53.695]  Yeah, I mean, even our NCOs told us we had options to get
[01:26:54.978 --> 01:26:59.600]  Uh, have certain stuff sprayed on us and stuff and our NCOs are like, don't take the option because you'll get sick.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:04.741]  But I have buddies who've been deployed and they're having the exact same symptoms that I've been having except magnified.
[01:27:04.781 --> 01:27:06.942]  What are they spraying on you?
[01:27:09.043 --> 01:27:10.764]  I didn't opt to go.
[01:27:11.344 --> 01:27:15.865]  But they said it would kill bugs on your uniforms if you wanted to use it and stuff like that.
[01:27:15.885 --> 01:27:17.546]  Primarily a permethrin spray.
[01:27:18.546 --> 01:27:20.007]  That's what they spray on the uniforms.
[01:27:20.087 --> 01:27:20.787]  It's a common thing.
[01:27:21.864 --> 01:27:24.186]  Now that's a South African plant, is that bad?
[01:27:24.486 --> 01:27:27.269]  No, no, this is a horrible, horrible pesticide.
[01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:34.194]  Again, the same thing, you know, we're coming there and then we have all the immunizations that have been given, multiple immunizations simultaneously.
[01:27:34.214 --> 01:27:40.039]  I mean, the anthrax... I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.
[01:27:40.619 --> 01:27:49.887]  We had to be quarantined, our whole barracks had to be quarantined because people would break it out like a scarlet fever, fleshing bacteria, and it all happened like a week after we were immunized.
[01:27:51.687 --> 01:27:53.629]  But it all, just crazy stuff.
[01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:57.632]  And again, they admit they're testing experimental vaccines on them, aren't they, doctor?
[01:27:58.833 --> 01:27:59.174]  Waivers.
[01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:02.196]  Like, after they gave us shots, the medic signed waivers.
[01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:08.542]  They're saying we wouldn't do them because we had any medical things happen because of the shots and stuff.
[01:28:08.602 --> 01:28:13.446]  I saw guys, I was throwing up blood and coughing up blood and just crazy stuff.
[01:28:14.227 --> 01:28:16.829]  And it all happened after the shots.
[01:28:16.889 --> 01:28:19.191]  And I'm just wondering, how can you get the VA's attention about this?
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.400]  Good luck.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.962]  I mean, I can work on it day to day.
[01:28:23.082 --> 01:28:24.443]  I mean, you can call the numbers.
[01:28:25.063 --> 01:28:27.025]  I mean, call Kilpatrick's hotline.
[01:28:27.205 --> 01:28:28.286]  I'll tell you what.
[01:28:28.447 --> 01:28:30.969]  I've got Paul Watson coming up, but I've got two other calls.
[01:28:31.009 --> 01:28:32.410]  Let's real fast, Dr. Rocky.
[01:28:32.791 --> 01:28:33.631]  Answer his question.
[01:28:33.651 --> 01:28:34.632]  Hit two final calls.
[01:28:36.294 --> 01:28:37.235]  We're on the march.
[01:28:37.695 --> 01:28:39.296]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:40.217 --> 01:28:42.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:48.058 --> 01:28:52.180]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.160]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:29:00.703]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:07.125]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:07.365 --> 01:29:09.206]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:29:09.486 --> 01:29:09.847]  I think so.
[01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:37.511]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:38.672 --> 01:29:42.635]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.655 --> 01:29:44.176]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:45.638 --> 01:29:50.722]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:58.088]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:29:58.228 --> 01:30:08.837]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:30:09.077 --> 01:30:13.641]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:30:13.901 --> 01:30:18.885]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:30:19.085 --> 01:30:22.027]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:22.267 --> 01:30:32.132]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:30:37.054 --> 01:30:38.995]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:45.507 --> 01:30:51.520]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.063]  Globalists are concerned
[01:30:59.403 --> 01:31:01.585]  Poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:31:24.002 --> 01:31:24.402]  I think so.
[01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:18.741]  I wish that I could fly, into the sky, so very high, just like a dragonfly.
[01:32:20.502 --> 01:32:29.770]  I'd fly above the trees, over the seas, in all degrees, to anywhere I please.
[01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:34.714]  Oh, I want to get away, I want to fly,
[01:32:40.462 --> 01:32:41.743]  Sorry, you can't do that.
[01:32:41.763 --> 01:32:42.523]  You can't get away.
[01:32:42.543 --> 01:32:43.504]  You can't fly away.
[01:32:43.884 --> 01:32:48.146]  And the thing is, the elite is getting more and more evil, more and more out of control.
[01:32:48.827 --> 01:32:52.449]  They're brainwashing the public at a greater and greater level, but the people are starting to wake up.
[01:32:52.489 --> 01:32:54.570]  I gotta move quicker, because I promised to play that song.
[01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:58.552]  Plus, we've got Paul Watson with an incredible development.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:06.922]  So please pay attention, but I want to let John, Anser, and Steve, at least these three callers, sorry to all the others, have a chance.
[01:33:07.262 --> 01:33:20.126]  John, real fast, Dr. Rocky finishing up, I mean the whole point of this last two hours or hour and a half is the VA isn't going to help you, doesn't want to help you, their job is there to make sure that a cover-up continues, correct?
[01:33:20.786 --> 01:33:21.146]  Pretty much.
[01:33:22.051 --> 01:33:22.851]  Three phone numbers.
[01:33:22.871 --> 01:33:27.912]  I want to get these out that everybody needs to call and yank their change, plus go to their Congressman or Senator and sit in their office.
[01:33:28.332 --> 01:33:30.053]  The first number is the Secretary of Defense.
[01:33:30.073 --> 01:33:33.794]  1-800-497-6261 That's for medical care from the Secretary of Defense.
[01:33:33.814 --> 01:33:37.874]  1-800-497-6261 The other two are direct VA numbers.
[01:33:37.894 --> 01:33:37.914]  1-877
[01:33:49.804 --> 01:33:50.204]  2-2-2-8-3-8-7.
[01:33:50.924 --> 01:34:00.246]  That's 1-8-7-7-2-2-2-8-3-8-7.
[01:34:00.986 --> 01:34:02.667]  And another one is 1-8-0-7-4-9-8-3-8-7.
[01:34:03.207 --> 01:34:08.748]  And what do you say when you call?
[01:34:09.108 --> 01:34:12.109]  Well, what you've got to do is you demand medical care and help.
[01:34:12.249 --> 01:34:13.389]  You've got to submit a claim.
[01:34:13.409 --> 01:34:17.050]  The one thing we have found out, and I'm working with the National Archives Inspector General,
[01:34:17.614 --> 01:34:21.336]  That the military records have been altered and destroyed at the National Heritage Center in St.
[01:34:21.396 --> 01:34:23.777]  Louis, Missouri, and also the Army keeps theirs in St.
[01:34:23.817 --> 01:34:24.077]  Louis.
[01:34:24.317 --> 01:34:25.338]  They're moving to Fort Knox.
[01:34:25.878 --> 01:34:28.959]  So, unless you've got copies of your own medical records, you can verify this.
[01:34:28.999 --> 01:34:30.660]  They're going to disregard it and deny your claim.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.381]  That's what's happened.
[01:34:31.401 --> 01:34:32.661]  Let me just say something here.
[01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:33.502]  This is important.
[01:34:33.862 --> 01:34:37.383]  It's important to call and let them know that we know what they're doing, and that does have some effect.
[01:34:37.403 --> 01:34:40.505]  But more importantly, tell everybody you know not to join the military.
[01:34:40.585 --> 01:34:44.547]  Say no to the draft when they stage another terror attack, and try to bring that forward.
[01:34:45.227 --> 01:34:48.170]  John, thank you for your service to our nation, and I'm sorry they abandoned you.
[01:35:08.223 --> 01:35:14.848]  Yes, I'm sorry too, and we're trying to not abandon you here, but it sounds to me like it's part of the same story.
[01:35:15.188 --> 01:35:16.989]  They're testing bioweapons on the troops.
[01:35:17.710 --> 01:35:19.311]  Let's talk to Ansher in Indiana.
[01:35:19.331 --> 01:35:20.652]  You're on the air with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[01:35:20.672 --> 01:35:21.012]  Go ahead.
[01:35:21.313 --> 01:35:21.693]  Hello.
[01:35:22.153 --> 01:35:24.675]  My humanity goes out to the good doctor and the last caller.
[01:35:25.756 --> 01:35:30.719]  But to change the subject here, it's about the Middle East going on right now.
[01:35:30.759 --> 01:35:32.601]  You have all the leaders, Bush, Malachi,
[01:35:33.965 --> 01:35:34.465]  President?
[01:35:34.605 --> 01:35:37.027]  The Prime Minister?
[01:35:37.047 --> 01:35:37.507]  The Pope?
[01:35:37.527 --> 01:35:38.128]  They're all over there.
[01:35:38.248 --> 01:35:38.928]  They're all over there.
[01:35:40.209 --> 01:35:40.910]  What's going down?
[01:35:44.692 --> 01:35:45.313]  Say a prayer.
[01:35:47.114 --> 01:35:47.554]  I don't know.
[01:35:49.375 --> 01:35:49.876]  Say a prayer.
[01:35:50.636 --> 01:35:55.800]  Right now my concern is stopping the war, stopping the exposures, getting medical care for not only the U.S.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.661]  troops but all of the coalition troops
[01:35:58.388 --> 01:36:03.371]  All of the contractors, and all of the Afghanis, Iraqis, and all the civilians, and most important, the children.
[01:36:03.731 --> 01:36:04.431]  The children.
[01:36:05.592 --> 01:36:07.113]  This nonsense has to stop now.
[01:36:08.033 --> 01:36:08.574]  Absolutely.
[01:36:09.394 --> 01:36:11.635]  This is my fifth day from waking up.
[01:36:12.356 --> 01:36:13.376]  And I'm still floored.
[01:36:13.937 --> 01:36:16.278]  I'm still trying to pick myself up, but I'm not afraid.
[01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:17.258]  How did you wake up?
[01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:19.840]  I saw Kevin Smith on Man Cal.
[01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:23.410]  Your producer, I believe?
[01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:26.692]  Yeah, you saw my radio producer on Fox News, and how did that wake you up?
[01:36:27.193 --> 01:36:51.310]  Well, I've always been curious about questions about 9-11 in particular, and so I took his name, I got online, I found all these sites, and I just started reading, and I read, and I took my skepticism and laid back and read more and thought, and I just looked over a lot of articles I read, and I
[01:36:54.731 --> 01:37:00.796]  Even as a little kid, growing up as a teenager, I always said to myself and my mom that this is not how it's supposed to be.
[01:37:02.056 --> 01:37:02.437]  Sorry.
[01:37:03.197 --> 01:37:05.539]  This is not how we're supposed to live.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:06.680]  Sorry.
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.721]  We're supposed to live as human beings.
[01:37:11.081 --> 01:37:14.282]  Answer, I appreciate your call, and I understand you, and it's good to have you on board.
[01:37:14.663 --> 01:37:23.606]  So many former commanders and high-level people say nothing ever made sense until they heard this radio show or broadcast similar to it, or what Dr. Rocky had to say.
[01:37:23.626 --> 01:37:29.348]  I mean, we all know something's wrong, and then once you break through and have the courage to admit the facts, it's scary.
[01:37:29.388 --> 01:37:35.671]  But, you know, it's better to know the truth than to not know the truth, because not knowing the truth doesn't mean reality changes, does it, Doctor?
[01:37:36.031 --> 01:37:38.834]  Now, let's hit reality real hard right now.
[01:37:39.494 --> 01:37:43.237]  I ask everybody to go to the actual 9-1-1 commission report.
[01:37:43.818 --> 01:37:44.158]  Okay?
[01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:50.083]  On that day, in the formal report, go to page 313, up in the upper right-hand corner.
[01:37:50.223 --> 01:37:55.588]  Look at the photograph published in the 9-1-1 commission report of the Pentagon, supposedly after an aircraft hit it.
[01:37:56.428 --> 01:37:59.771]  And you will see that their own photograph verifies it did not occur.
[01:38:01.092 --> 01:38:01.873]  It's that simple.
[01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:03.782]  How dumb do they think we are?
[01:38:04.923 --> 01:38:06.944]  They think that, you know, this is what happened.
[01:38:07.024 --> 01:38:08.205]  This is where I had to hit the wall.
[01:38:08.265 --> 01:38:12.648]  What happened is that they think because they tell us and they demand us and that we're loyal military personnel.
[01:38:12.688 --> 01:38:14.689]  You have to understand, I'm an army officer finishing my job.
[01:38:14.729 --> 01:38:15.229]  That's what I am.
[01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.950]  Okay?
[01:38:15.970 --> 01:38:16.730]  You have to understand that.
[01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:19.052]  I'm an old NCO, an army officer finishing my job.
[01:38:19.072 --> 01:38:19.652]  It's that simple.
[01:38:20.433 --> 01:38:21.353]  I'm not an activist.
[01:38:21.414 --> 01:38:25.316]  I'm not a, you know, whatever you want to call them, anti.
[01:38:25.416 --> 01:38:26.597]  I'm just finishing the job.
[01:38:27.077 --> 01:38:31.220]  They think because they are the leaders, they make the statement that we'll follow them blindly.
[01:38:32.863 --> 01:38:37.267]  And look what happened in Germany in the 30s and 40s.
[01:38:37.687 --> 01:38:38.147]  I agree.
[01:38:38.448 --> 01:38:42.071]  Final call quickly because we've got Paul Watson with very important news waiting.
[01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:43.913]  We've got to have Dr. Rocky back up.
[01:38:44.093 --> 01:38:45.354]  It's so amazing.
[01:38:45.374 --> 01:38:46.235]  We appreciate his time.
[01:38:47.015 --> 01:38:48.437]  Stephen Kansas, quickly, go ahead.
[01:38:49.338 --> 01:38:50.579]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[01:38:51.199 --> 01:38:55.883]  I was thinking about going to work for Halliburton.
[01:38:55.903 --> 01:38:57.004]  I can't find a job here.
[01:38:57.965 --> 01:38:58.546]  You want to die?
[01:39:00.271 --> 01:39:01.231]  I can pay my bills.
[01:39:01.591 --> 01:39:22.676]  You can pay your bills, but after you pay your bills and after you're trashed with the stuff down in New Orleans where the Halliburton guys were all sick down there from work they did, or you get over to Iraq and you get blown up or shot or ill or sick and you don't have any medical care, you don't have any insurance left, yeah, you'll pay your bills, yeah, you'll make $1,000 a month or $1,500 a day, whatever it happens to be, but what's your life worth?
[01:39:23.616 --> 01:39:25.697]  What's your children's future worth?
[01:39:25.737 --> 01:39:26.817]  What is your future worth?
[01:39:27.719 --> 01:39:36.206]  If you're a young kid and you're trash and you've got nothing left and you have no income, what good is that money that you made for a year until you got blowed up, trashed, or sick?
[01:39:36.586 --> 01:39:40.309]  And if you don't get blowed up, you get trashed, you're going to come back sick like a half a million others.
[01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:43.492]  It was just an idea that was brought up to me through some friends.
[01:40:05.598 --> 01:40:08.559]  Make some money, go over to Iraq or overseas or something like that.
[01:40:08.579 --> 01:40:11.359]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:40:11.499 --> 01:40:12.260]  Well, I understand.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.920]  If an IUD doesn't kill you, the DU or something else is.
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.581]  So please, sir.
[01:40:19.221 --> 01:40:22.102]  But listen, you can lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink.
[01:40:23.582 --> 01:40:25.122]  Word to the wise is sufficient.
[01:40:25.383 --> 01:40:28.203]  After hearing this show, you're thinking about going over there?
[01:40:29.063 --> 01:40:30.564]  Well, you want to give me a job, Alex?
[01:40:31.994 --> 01:40:38.518]  You know, I was at one time, you know, as director of the Bradley Labs and director of all these projects, a senior military officer, I made good money.
[01:40:40.559 --> 01:40:41.199]  It's not worth it.
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:43.341]  It's absolutely not worth it.
[01:40:44.561 --> 01:40:45.562]  Because you have to have insurance.
[01:40:45.642 --> 01:40:55.508]  Once you get sick or dead and you come back and you do get private insurance from an employer, anything that happened to you in combat or service life that worked for Halliburton is exempt from medical care by
[01:40:56.963 --> 01:40:58.424]  All laws that exist in our country.
[01:40:58.524 --> 01:41:00.444]  Dr. Rockey, this is such a central subject.
[01:41:00.464 --> 01:41:04.166]  Let me get you back up in the next few weeks for two hours if we can do it.
[01:41:04.206 --> 01:41:05.707]  And I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:41:05.787 --> 01:41:08.208]  And folks can just type your name, Dr. Doug Rockey, into Google.
[01:41:08.468 --> 01:41:11.809]  We have links to papers you've written and documents on Infowars.com.
[01:41:11.909 --> 01:41:13.630]  I salute you and thanks for coming on with us.
[01:41:13.650 --> 01:41:17.991]  You know, and everybody, you need to pull up the Army regulations, the orders, the directives, and read them yourself.
[01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:19.112]  You're going to see it's all there.
[01:41:19.432 --> 01:41:20.213]  And they're disregarded.
[01:41:20.253 --> 01:41:21.034]  That's what's scary.
[01:41:21.435 --> 01:41:23.197]  Well, they admit they just kill troops.
[01:41:23.397 --> 01:41:25.039]  They just attest chemical weapons on them.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.022]  Thank you for coming on and we salute you, sir.
[01:41:27.462 --> 01:41:27.983]  Thank you, sir.
[01:41:28.043 --> 01:41:28.524]  Have a good day.
[01:41:28.804 --> 01:41:29.185]  God bless.
[01:41:30.899 --> 01:41:31.639]  Paul is waiting.
[01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:33.040]  He can cover this news in ten minutes.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.860]  It's very important, but I promise to play this.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.040]  We'll play part of it.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:36.701]  It's a five minute song.
[01:41:36.721 --> 01:41:38.461]  We'll play about three minutes, then go to Paul.
[01:41:38.861 --> 01:41:39.641]  This is Paris.
[01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:41.682]  He came up with this song about three years ago.
[01:41:41.702 --> 01:41:44.922]  He sent me an email saying 9-11 helped wake him up.
[01:41:44.962 --> 01:41:45.763]  I never got him on.
[01:41:45.923 --> 01:41:50.164]  I need to tell my producer to get him on the show, but this song really, really says it all.
[01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:52.624]  We've had requests to play it again, so here it is.
[01:41:54.845 --> 01:41:55.345]  Good evening.
[01:41:55.445 --> 01:41:59.746]  I would like to report on the state of our war against the American people.
[01:42:02.034 --> 01:42:14.281]  We're mounting a sustained campaign to crack down on every American, and every person of every faith, and every nation, and to bring them to justice.
[01:42:16.963 --> 01:42:21.765]  All missions are being executed according to plan, without warning or provocation.
[01:42:21.785 --> 01:42:26.288]  Americans are being swept up in an international dragnet.
[01:42:27.809 --> 01:42:31.031]  Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens here in abroad.
[01:42:32.043 --> 01:42:36.344]  It has everything to do with hate and evil and murder and prejudice.
[01:42:36.424 --> 01:42:37.284]  America's strong.
[01:42:37.464 --> 01:42:38.845]  Federal agents!
[01:42:39.085 --> 01:42:41.925]  We are armed!
[01:42:42.266 --> 01:42:45.266]  What would you do if you knew?
[01:42:45.306 --> 01:42:47.467]  You are not human, you know.
[01:42:47.527 --> 01:42:49.607]  What would you stand up to?
[01:42:49.647 --> 01:42:51.228]  What would you turn away to?
[01:42:51.568 --> 01:42:56.009]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:42:59.315 --> 01:43:00.996]  Oh, would you turn away?
[01:43:01.216 --> 01:43:06.437]  What would you do if you Knew all the things we knew?
[01:43:07.057 --> 01:43:08.978]  Would you stand up for true?
[01:43:09.018 --> 01:43:11.839]  Or would you turn away too?
[01:43:12.379 --> 01:43:16.780]  And then what if you saw All of the things that's wrong?
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.401]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[01:43:20.423 --> 01:43:21.484]  We're good to go.
[01:43:35.211 --> 01:43:36.171]  We're good to go.
[01:44:20.725 --> 01:44:20.845]  Yeah.
[01:44:25.171 --> 01:44:27.633]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[01:44:27.653 --> 01:44:28.694]  4-9-11, what's his name?
[01:44:29.374 --> 01:44:33.137]  How even is he waving flags like they lost their mind?
[01:44:33.217 --> 01:44:35.479]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[01:44:35.759 --> 01:44:38.201]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:40.523]  The oldest trick in the book is make an enemy.
[01:44:40.863 --> 01:44:43.145]  A phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:45.847]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, get in search.
[01:44:45.867 --> 01:44:48.549]  Ain't nothing changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[01:44:48.569 --> 01:44:51.131]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[01:44:51.291 --> 01:44:53.653]  But I remember 4-7-10 by how these devils do it.
[01:44:54.293 --> 01:44:56.375]  Giuliani at Diallo, how he doin'?
[01:44:56.475 --> 01:44:58.857]  We in the streets, holla, jail to the thief, follow.
[01:44:59.198 --> 01:45:01.240]  Waving flags, bring these wagons to they knees.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.762]  Oil, blood, money, make these killers ride cold.
[01:45:03.962 --> 01:45:06.524]  Suspicious suicide, people dyin', never told.
[01:45:06.965 --> 01:45:09.367]  It's all a part of playin' God, so you think we need him?
[01:45:09.527 --> 01:45:12.049]  While bein' ass-crossed, take away your rights to freedom.
[01:45:12.289 --> 01:45:14.571]  Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators.
[01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:17.194]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause it's major.
[01:45:17.494 --> 01:45:19.416]  Why don't you do what you do?
[01:45:33.907 --> 01:45:35.379]  I'm strong.
[01:45:38.197 --> 01:45:40.779]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same?
[01:45:40.999 --> 01:45:56.271]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers, but the beat is slingin' Mine eyes seen the gory of the comin' of the beast So every story, every word I'm sayin' is a beast See, you could witness the Illuminati body count Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout You think a couple thousand lies mean shit to killers?
[01:45:56.491 --> 01:46:07.980]  Nigga, I swear to God, we the ones, ain't no villains Or any other word they think to demonize the country Ain't no terror threaten, less approval ratin' slumpin' So I'ma say it for the record, we the ones that planned it Ain't no other country
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:08.761]  We're good to go.
[01:46:25.202 --> 01:46:26.143]  That is such a great song.
[01:46:44.625 --> 01:46:47.107]  Alright, let's go to Paul Watson.
[01:46:47.127 --> 01:46:47.967]  Thanks for holding, Paul.
[01:46:48.007 --> 01:46:49.689]  We got caught up on several things.
[01:46:50.049 --> 01:46:52.651]  Huge news, we could talk for the entire show about this alone.
[01:46:52.671 --> 01:46:56.873]  An article up on PrisonPlanet.com that everybody needs to get out to the four corners.
[01:46:57.654 --> 01:47:00.376]  RIAA legal ruling could shut down the Internet.
[01:47:00.456 --> 01:47:00.656]  U.S.
[01:47:00.696 --> 01:47:06.320]  government supports legal case that would criminalize making any files available on the World Wide Web.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:06.620]  Paul?
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.822]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[01:47:09.002 --> 01:47:09.662]  Good to have you here.
[01:47:10.623 --> 01:47:13.665]  Well, as everybody knows, I mean, the Internet is the last
[01:47:14.315 --> 01:47:16.056]  Outpost of freedom of speech.
[01:47:16.916 --> 01:47:18.717]  The mainstream media is controlled.
[01:47:18.757 --> 01:47:22.639]  We've got protests confined to free speech zones.
[01:47:23.399 --> 01:47:28.522]  So the internet is the last forum where you can actually go out there and say what you want to say.
[01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:31.583]  And a lot of people in the establishment don't like that.
[01:47:32.263 --> 01:47:35.705]  Which is why they're using this method, which is not the only method.
[01:47:36.783 --> 01:47:49.229]  To grease the skids for regulation of the internet via these random sweeping lawsuits that target people who use these file sharing networks like Kazar, BitTorrent, etc, etc.
[01:47:53.051 --> 01:47:53.751]  That was interesting.
[01:47:53.791 --> 01:47:55.672]  We just lost Paul from the UK.
[01:47:55.692 --> 01:47:56.573]  We'll get him back on.
[01:47:57.093 --> 01:47:58.694]  Yeah, we'll get him right back on.
[01:47:59.714 --> 01:48:00.475]  And there's a lot of things.
[01:48:00.495 --> 01:48:05.357]  They're going to Internet 2 to force you onto it, then you sign contracts, be able to be on the web, you're ID'd,
[01:48:06.358 --> 01:48:08.398]  They're moving in to tax the internet.
[01:48:08.418 --> 01:48:09.919]  They're moving in to tax emails.
[01:48:10.419 --> 01:48:12.399]  They're moving in to restrict free speech on the web.
[01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:17.700]  But this says that you have to be licensed, and that's what they've been calling for, to be able to share files.
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.320]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:29.162]  Yeah, there's 19,000 cases that have been motioned by the RIAA, Recording Industry Association of America.
[01:48:30.142 --> 01:48:33.603]  Basically, the way in which they target their victims for these lawsuits
[01:48:34.213 --> 01:48:35.333]  No is no bounds.
[01:48:35.393 --> 01:48:42.714]  We've got no time to get into that now, but the case that's got... McCain said he wants to send out a virus to, quote, blow your computer up.
[01:48:43.275 --> 01:48:45.575]  If it just shows you have any files on your computer.
[01:48:46.755 --> 01:48:47.135]  Right.
[01:48:47.275 --> 01:49:00.097]  They target people who, for example, UMG versus Lindor, a computer illiterate Brooklyn mother who'd never used a computer, but merely was cleaning and dusted near one.
[01:49:00.497 --> 01:49:01.878]  She was a home health aide.
[01:49:01.898 --> 01:49:03.418]  She went from house to house cleaning.
[01:49:03.979 --> 01:49:07.922]  She got hit by a lawsuit for distributing copyrighted music.
[01:49:08.383 --> 01:49:13.226]  What they do is they use parents because parents aren't very computer literate.
[01:49:13.267 --> 01:49:13.847]  They don't know.
[01:49:14.307 --> 01:49:16.349]  They get befuddled by the details of it all.
[01:49:16.369 --> 01:49:18.411]  They use the parents to get to the children.
[01:49:19.011 --> 01:49:20.612]  And they've done that in numerous cases.
[01:49:20.933 --> 01:49:24.315]  Well, let's talk about this new ruling where they're saying file sharing, period.
[01:49:25.516 --> 01:49:26.557]  They're going to come after you.
[01:49:26.577 --> 01:49:29.820]  This is so important that the answer is share more files.
[01:49:30.839 --> 01:49:33.224]  And what they're going after isn't their own files.
[01:49:33.264 --> 01:49:36.571]  They want to shut down the free flow of information period.
[01:49:37.072 --> 01:49:39.056]  Final segment, Key Info, straight ahead.
[01:49:48.777 --> 01:49:49.237]  It's here!
[01:49:49.477 --> 01:49:54.240]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:50:02.284]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:02.964 --> 01:50:10.028]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:10.428 --> 01:50:17.252]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:17.785 --> 01:50:21.828]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:22.128 --> 01:50:25.691]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:28.032]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:28.352 --> 01:50:32.295]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:45.717 --> 01:52:48.859]  Just briefly before we finish up with this really important story,
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:04.924]  During the month and a half before Christmas, we always offer PrisonPlanet.tv yearly memberships at close to half price.
[01:53:05.524 --> 01:53:09.226]  The arbitrary price I picked happens to be 5.3 months.
[01:53:09.726 --> 01:53:15.168]  Five months plus free when you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:53:15.608 --> 01:53:18.089]  Or you can go get a trial $5.95 monthly membership.
[01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:22.431]  It comes out to 15 cents a day, even less when you get a yearly membership.
[01:53:23.087 --> 01:53:27.889]  So, five months free for the next couple weeks, you're going to be able to get this.
[01:53:28.769 --> 01:53:33.791]  PrisonPlanet.tv, all 15 of my films, super high quality bandwidth, medium and low, whatever you want.
[01:53:34.671 --> 01:53:36.552]  Two different formats of that.

[01:53:42.202 --> 01:53:42.743]  Go check it out.

[01:53:55.246 --> 01:53:58.067]  People ask how you support me and here on the Genesis Network,
[01:53:58.627 --> 01:54:00.788]  You just support us by getting the films, plus they're great films.
[01:54:00.828 --> 01:54:02.609]  So just, we do need your support to support us.
[01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:04.150]  Paul, we've got about four minutes left.
[01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:13.135]  Finish up with this incredible article you put together, because they're openly coming out saying now they're going to target people who just show that their computers have file-sharing software.
[01:54:13.155 --> 01:54:15.977]  I mean, they're saying they're arbitrarily going to decide what you can do.
[01:54:17.077 --> 01:54:17.338]  Right.
[01:54:17.578 --> 01:54:24.241]  And that case is Elektra versus Barker in Manhattan, where this woman downloaded music legally.
[01:54:24.281 --> 01:54:25.162]  She paid for it.
[01:54:25.899 --> 01:54:28.442]  No one ever copied it from her computer.
[01:54:28.502 --> 01:54:39.095]  It was never shared on a file network, but simply because she's got the files in a shared folder on her computer, that constitutes distribution according to the RIAA.
[01:54:39.576 --> 01:54:44.302]  And as Ray Beckham and one of the lawyers representing the defendants in the case said,
[01:54:45.674 --> 01:54:57.738]  If the rulings to be accepted it would lead to the entire internet being shut down because the internet is nothing more than a giant network of hyperlinks making files available.
[01:54:58.259 --> 01:55:13.744]  And I did some research that's exactly what the European Union is saying, that's what corporations are saying is that they want you to have to go get a license or share files on approved network and those licenses are going to cost more than radio licenses.
[01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:15.130]  Right.
[01:55:15.490 --> 01:55:27.555]  They're not going to shut down the internet completely, because the transnational corporations that are in bed with the US government, who have filed briefings supporting this motion, by the way, would scream bloody murder.
[01:55:27.575 --> 01:55:38.839]  But as you said, what they're going to do, if it sails through, is grease the skids for internet too, the increased regulation, surveillance, control of the internet that these control freaks have been yearning for for years.
[01:55:39.713 --> 01:55:52.025]  So you would have to get government permission to set up a blog where that blog or website rested on a subdomain and the owners of that domain can censor, stifle, delete anything they disagree with.
[01:55:52.326 --> 01:55:56.450]  So it would be like having a subdomain on MySpace or YouTube.
[01:55:57.105 --> 01:56:09.699]  We've had personal experience almost every week, YouTube and Google Video, anything they don't like, anything sensitive, political, you know, troops beating Iraqi kids, things like that, they'll just delete it straight away.
[01:56:09.859 --> 01:56:10.339]  Oh, our own?
[01:56:10.379 --> 01:56:12.221]  They've been deleting all our Bilderberg stuff?
[01:56:12.642 --> 01:56:17.067]  Yeah, they delete material which we put up there in the first place.
[01:56:17.427 --> 01:56:18.028]  You made it.
[01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:26.517]  And the filtering, the logging is getting so sophisticated that they can target specific files immediately and delete them.
[01:56:26.577 --> 01:56:29.200]  So that's what it will be like under Internet 2.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.541]  You won't own your own website.
[01:56:30.581 --> 01:56:34.726]  It will be subject to the whim of a corporation or the government.
[01:56:35.627 --> 01:56:36.327]  Absolutely.
[01:56:36.467 --> 01:56:40.289]  And you told me you're going to have a part two on this in the next few days.
[01:56:40.369 --> 01:56:42.350]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:44.331]  Everybody get the story, get out to everyone you know.
[01:56:45.371 --> 01:56:47.232]  The headline, R.I.A.A.
[01:56:47.332 --> 01:56:49.533]  Legal Ruling Could Shut Down The Internet.
[01:56:50.613 --> 01:56:52.354]  This is amazing information.
[01:56:52.394 --> 01:56:53.974]  They're hitting it from a hundred different angles.
[01:56:53.994 --> 01:56:55.315]  This is one of the biggest assaults.
[01:56:55.655 --> 01:56:57.696]  A huge battering ram at
[01:56:58.929 --> 01:57:01.250]  Our main citadel in the fight against the globalists.
[01:57:01.770 --> 01:57:03.150]  But it shows we're hurting them, Bradley.
[01:57:03.170 --> 01:57:04.151]  We're going to go on hurting them.
[01:57:04.171 --> 01:57:04.931]  We're not going to stop.
[01:57:05.191 --> 01:57:07.012]  The key is, don't let this intimidation work.
[01:57:07.472 --> 01:57:09.332]  Intensify your file sharing.
[01:57:09.972 --> 01:57:12.733]  Intensify the news sharing.
[01:57:12.813 --> 01:57:14.994]  Intensify the info war.
[01:57:15.114 --> 01:57:16.494]  And never surrender.
[01:57:16.754 --> 01:57:17.835]  Paul, thanks for coming on.
[01:57:18.295 --> 01:57:18.835]  Cheers, Alex.
[01:57:19.175 --> 01:57:19.655]  Take care.
[01:57:20.115 --> 01:57:21.176]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[01:57:21.296 --> 01:57:22.256]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[01:57:22.576 --> 01:57:23.857]  God bless you all.
[01:57:25.845 --> 01:57:30.440]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:42.176 --> 01:57:42.816]  Big Brother.
[01:57:43.497 --> 01:57:44.538]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.339]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:47.019 --> 01:57:47.840]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:49.481]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:50.161 --> 01:57:53.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:54.344 --> 01:57:58.446]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:01.548 --> 01:58:06.611]  The famous director, David Lynch, has gone public on 9-11.
[01:58:06.651 --> 01:58:08.653]  We'll be recapping that later in the hour.
[01:58:08.733 --> 01:58:10.474]  So has the big actor, James Brolin.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.682]  Pretty big news because this always has a large effect with the generally dumbed down public looking into 9-11.
[01:58:20.782 --> 01:58:24.643]  We'll tell you more about those articles we wrote last night on that subject.
[01:58:25.464 --> 01:58:38.728]  We're in our final four minutes or so with Tom Kimmel, grandson of Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was wrongfully shouldered with the blame for Pearl Harbor when he was deliberately blocked from learning about the sneak attack plan
[01:58:39.748 --> 01:58:44.551]  And we are talking to his grandson right now, who is in the last four minutes now, finishing up.
[01:58:44.631 --> 01:58:45.691]  Any other key points?
[01:58:45.731 --> 01:58:46.332]  Please continue.
[01:58:47.672 --> 01:58:59.579]  Well, probably the best way we can honor the memory of those fallen at Pearl Harbor, and there were 2,403 men murdered at Pearl Harbor, if we've got to tell it like it is.
[01:59:00.119 --> 01:59:03.861]  The best way we can honor them would be follow the
[01:59:04.868 --> 01:59:14.811]  Uh, initiative of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association and restore the ranks or advance posthumously on the retired list, Admiral Kimmel and General Short.
[01:59:15.252 --> 01:59:25.175]  And we should do this not only in accordance with the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association's specific recommendations, but we should do it because the Congress passed a law
[01:59:25.835 --> 01:59:44.179]  recommending in perpetuity, in perpetuity, that the President of the United States, whoever he is now, or whoever he or she may be in the future, Alex, that they should advance Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short to their highest held temporary ranks in World War II in accordance with the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:54.462]  That law was passed by the Congress October 15, 2000, and it was signed into law October 30th by President Clinton.
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:57.182]  But President Clinton did not take the action.
[01:59:57.922 --> 02:00:08.390]  And we are denied any kind of full explanation as to why this action is not being taken by the current administration.
[02:00:09.251 --> 02:00:17.757]  We have found that the current administration reviewed the matter and the reviewers wrote it up in a bifurcated fashion.
[02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:20.139]  In other words, they wrote up a memoranda
[02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:25.193]  Indicating that the action should be taken, and they listed all the reasons.
[02:00:25.253 --> 02:00:26.775]  That was memorandum number one.
[02:00:27.435 --> 02:00:33.761]  Memorandum number two was the same kind of thing, only this time, why the action should not be taken.
[02:00:34.441 --> 02:00:42.969]  So we have tried to obtain both of these memoranda, but we are only provided the one that indicated they should not take the action.
[02:00:43.792 --> 02:00:46.053]  And, of course, it is heavily redacted.
[02:00:46.513 --> 02:00:51.394]  We are unable to determine who actually wrote the memorandum.
[02:00:51.674 --> 02:00:58.216]  Or what lies they, yet again, including themselves in the crime, were foisted upon your grandfather and the general.
[02:00:59.157 --> 02:01:00.677]  You may like this one, Alex.
[02:01:00.737 --> 02:01:06.339]  The reason we are denied knowledge of who wrote the memorandum is under a terrorist theory.
[02:01:06.872 --> 02:01:15.094]  In other words, revealing who it was that wrote the memorandum might expose them to some sort of terrorist retribution.
[02:01:15.394 --> 02:01:15.874]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:16.534 --> 02:01:22.515]  They're using 9-11 to make where they dump toxic waste secret, or how much money's been stolen from the Pentagon secret.
[02:01:22.535 --> 02:01:23.596]  It's a license for crime.
[02:01:23.996 --> 02:01:27.536]  Sir, I want to thank you for coming on our broadcast.
[02:01:27.596 --> 02:01:29.797]  I want to thank you for your
[02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.491]  We're good to go.
[02:01:47.224 --> 02:01:53.746]  Indeed, I am busy, but this is what's keeping me alive now, so I look forward to the next one.
[02:01:53.766 --> 02:01:55.787]  Maybe we can do this again next year, if not sooner.
[02:01:56.167 --> 02:01:57.728]  Absolutely, but I'll tell you this.
[02:01:57.768 --> 02:02:03.070]  Your grandfather, your father, and yourself and others have gotten their names back in the court of public opinion.
[02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:12.293]  They've had major polls where 90 plus percent of Americans know that Pearl Harbor was a setup and know that your grandfather and others were hung out to dry.
[02:02:12.313 --> 02:02:13.153]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:02:14.733 --> 02:02:16.935]  Well, thanks for your assistance in this matter.
[02:02:17.155 --> 02:02:17.495]  You bet.
[02:02:17.535 --> 02:02:17.896]  Take care.
[02:02:17.916 --> 02:02:18.636]  Have a good vacation.
[02:02:19.297 --> 02:02:19.657]  Okay.
[02:02:19.677 --> 02:02:20.278]  So long, Alex.
[02:02:20.698 --> 02:02:21.419]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:02:21.559 --> 02:02:21.979]  All right.
[02:02:22.099 --> 02:02:29.607]  Judge Napolitano is scheduled to be popping in with us with his new book, and then I've got a bunch of other news I want to be covering.
[02:02:30.187 --> 02:02:32.709]  And we may even have time to jam in a few calls.
[02:02:33.911 --> 02:02:34.631]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:34.711 --> 02:02:36.093]  It's Genesis Communications.
[02:02:40.862 --> 02:02:41.322]  It's here!
[02:02:41.543 --> 02:02:46.325]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:46.686 --> 02:02:54.351]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:55.031 --> 02:03:02.075]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:02.476 --> 02:03:09.400]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:09.850 --> 02:03:13.914]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:14.214 --> 02:03:17.717]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:18.177 --> 02:03:20.099]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:20.439 --> 02:03:24.343]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:37.614 --> 02:03:39.476]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:03:39.796 --> 02:03:41.337]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:03:41.738 --> 02:03:41.998]  What?
[02:03:42.338 --> 02:03:42.718]  Again?
[02:03:43.119 --> 02:03:44.760]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:49.244]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:03:49.484 --> 02:03:50.785]  Why did you do that?
[02:03:50.985 --> 02:03:56.770]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:03:57.090 --> 02:03:58.111]  Are we there yet?
[02:03:58.211 --> 02:03:59.272]  for the entire trip.
[02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.734]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:04:02.215 --> 02:04:03.216]  Great idea.
[02:04:03.236 --> 02:04:06.058]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:04:06.437 --> 02:04:08.903]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:04:09.103 --> 02:04:13.513]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:04:13.794 --> 02:04:14.095]  Honey!
[02:04:14.915 --> 02:04:16.156]  You're terrific!
[02:04:16.536 --> 02:04:18.037]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:04:18.157 --> 02:04:21.558]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:04:21.838 --> 02:04:22.619]  Now can we stop?
[02:04:23.119 --> 02:04:23.859]  I need to go, too.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.602]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:28.662 --> 02:04:28.962]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:29.002 --> 02:04:30.563]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:37.938 --> 02:04:40.360]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:44.183]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:44.563 --> 02:04:47.506]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:47.786 --> 02:04:54.151]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:04:54.231 --> 02:04:58.635]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:04:58.855 --> 02:05:03.217]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:03.378 --> 02:05:05.979]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:06.019 --> 02:05:08.780]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:09.241 --> 02:05:11.782]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:11.822 --> 02:05:16.084]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:16.124 --> 02:05:16.985]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:17.265 --> 02:05:21.888]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:05:22.068 --> 02:05:23.709]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:23.729 --> 02:05:25.290]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:38.704 --> 02:05:40.805]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:41.365 --> 02:05:44.247]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:44.347 --> 02:06:00.114]  Alright, let's run through a bunch of important news right now.
[02:06:00.134 --> 02:06:03.095]  We did spend the last hour on Pearl Harbor.
[02:06:03.115 --> 02:06:06.597]  It is the 65th anniversary of that staged event, that provocateur event.
[02:06:08.467 --> 02:06:11.708]  The FDA rejects new limits on mercury in vaccines.
[02:06:13.928 --> 02:06:17.690]  Group petitioned government to restrict the use of controversial preservative.
[02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:25.792]  Associated Press, federal health officials, won't put new restrictions on the use of mercury-based preservatives in vaccines and other medicines.
[02:06:25.912 --> 02:06:26.852]  Other medicines.
[02:06:26.972 --> 02:06:27.652]  Hundreds of it.
[02:06:29.473 --> 02:06:33.254]  Denying a petition that sought to limit it because of health concerns.
[02:06:35.334 --> 02:06:37.755]  Now there's no debate that it has a horrible electrochemical
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:39.820]  Reaction in the brain.
[02:06:42.341 --> 02:06:44.282]  It's the worst substance in the brain.
[02:06:44.622 --> 02:06:49.024]  It causes an electrical short in the neurons, not just the toxic effect.
[02:06:50.785 --> 02:07:04.991]  A group called the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, seeking the restrictions on thimerosal, citing concerns the preservative is linked to autism and a rapidly, a reply dated September 26,
[02:07:06.474 --> 02:07:10.435]  But made public only Tuesday, the FDA rejected the petition.
[02:07:11.796 --> 02:07:26.300]  Only a small number of licensed and approved products still contain thimerosal, and the available evidence supports FDA's conclusion that all currently licensed vaccines and other pharmacological drug products containing thimerosal are safe.
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:29.581]  Dr. Jeffrey Shuren,
[02:07:30.766 --> 02:07:36.792]  The FDA's Assistant Commissioner for Policy wrote in denying the petition.
[02:07:38.974 --> 02:07:45.161]  Now let's put on our thinking caps, but more than just our thinking caps, our memory caps.
[02:07:46.522 --> 02:07:52.468]  The last five years, because of campaigns by different autistic organizations and the Autistic Society and
[02:07:54.301 --> 02:08:10.126]  Back in 2003, the 2000 minutes from the CDC got released where they were admitting it had brain damaged millions and caused autism to go from unknown to an epidemic and that they wouldn't give their own children or grandchildren any drug or any vaccine with it in it.
[02:08:11.547 --> 02:08:12.447]  That stuff got leaked.
[02:08:12.747 --> 02:08:15.428]  Congressman Dan Burton's committee made a big stink over it.
[02:08:17.028 --> 02:08:22.650]  So the news then had a big PR drive to tell you it had been taken out of all vaccines and drugs.
[02:08:23.777 --> 02:08:37.103]  Now what they did was, by a FDA regulation, was order vaccine makers to make small lots available to health care providers if they requested them.
[02:08:38.044 --> 02:08:44.347]  They are available if you know where to get them, and most hospitals and doctors offices and pediatricians don't even know they can get them.
[02:08:44.587 --> 02:08:47.688]  You have to tell them if you believe in vaccines and they can order them.
[02:08:48.049 --> 02:08:51.230]  And they cost, in some cases, as I've checked into it, 10 times.
[02:08:54.432 --> 02:08:56.173]  So, uh, nice sleight of hand.
[02:08:56.213 --> 02:08:59.516]  This is how these, this is all lawyer speak, double speak, you see.
[02:08:59.936 --> 02:09:02.638]  Oh, we took all the mercury out.
[02:09:02.678 --> 02:09:05.100]  No, the mercury is out of the vaccines.
[02:09:06.861 --> 02:09:14.246]  And then when they show it on Good Morning America, which I have a tape of them doing, they show a particular sub, uh, lot release that doesn't have it.
[02:09:15.847 --> 02:09:19.209]  And then I, well, it uses some type of salts to preserve it.
[02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:21.251]  Which isn't bad for you.
[02:09:21.833 --> 02:09:24.675]  But then Lord knows if they'll do it with mercury, what else is in those vaccines?
[02:09:24.715 --> 02:09:30.958]  You've got them putting hormones in, sterilization agents, chemicals, and that's been the news, the back of the paper.
[02:09:31.759 --> 02:09:34.861]  So this is how dumb they think we are, how dumb they think you are.
[02:09:35.901 --> 02:09:38.182]  And then I have other AP reports, because AP does a good job.
[02:09:38.243 --> 02:09:38.783]  You will see it.
[02:09:38.823 --> 02:09:43.746]  I've got it posted in our Vaccine and Toxica section there on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:43.766 --> 02:09:45.046]  I forget the exact name of the section.
[02:09:45.166 --> 02:09:45.867]  It's in there.
[02:09:46.494 --> 02:10:03.009]  from three years ago, where they came out and said, actually, contrary to popular belief, they only made lots available without it, very small numbers of it, and just a few percentage points of the vaccine is available with it, and it also spoils, so most of it gets thrown away.
[02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:11.677]  They said, and actually we don't know why this has been done, but they have increased the standard flu shot
[02:10:12.307 --> 02:10:36.518]  And the manufacturers all privately agree on their own standards, there within the FDA standards, but it's a wide variant there, but they agree upon specific standards, that for the average weight of an American, that 50 times safe levels of mercury are in a flu shot.
[02:10:37.698 --> 02:10:38.959]  It was even higher for MMR.
[02:10:39.119 --> 02:10:39.899]  This was in the AP.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:41.120]  Great report!
[02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:45.517]  Because it fits with what we've gotten from medical experts and people on the field that we've interviewed here.
[02:10:47.938 --> 02:10:58.386]  They're increasing it from 50 times to 200 plus, because it was between 200 and 250 times the level that's safe.
[02:10:59.707 --> 02:11:10.655]  And then it reported that babies by the age of two have had three rounds of shots, MMR, measles, mumps, rubella, the pertosis,
[02:11:11.969 --> 02:11:25.519]  uh... the tetanus uh... the hepatitis three rounds uh... the flu in many cases now recommended and make claims of the law, which is no law because they're total criminals.
[02:11:25.979 --> 02:11:27.100]  Think about the fraud!
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:35.947]  I mean, this is just scamming massively and uh... that little, what, at the age of two the average weight is about twenty three pounds.
[02:11:35.967 --> 02:11:36.887]  I'm going from memory here.
[02:11:36.927 --> 02:11:37.408]  Go look it up.
[02:11:37.508 --> 02:11:38.028]  Don't believe me.
[02:11:39.269 --> 02:11:40.170]  Twenty three, twenty five pounds.
[02:11:41.056 --> 02:11:52.845]  That it is, of course, many times worse than it being 200 plus times each shot safe level for the average weight of an adult is much higher than that of a two-year-old toddler.
[02:11:54.266 --> 02:12:00.810]  And in the majority of the cases with autistic children, they're running around, they're giggling, they're laughing, they have a great life.
[02:12:01.611 --> 02:12:09.737]  The third round, it gets so toxic that that is where children who do not have a genetic
[02:12:10.407 --> 02:12:21.116]  That even children who have the gene that blocks most of the mercury, because it's built into us, eating a lot of fish, natural mercury, God put it into us where it blocks most of it.
[02:12:33.536 --> 02:12:40.418]  Even children who have the normal gene to block the majority of the mercury toxify and within 24 hours are gone.
[02:12:41.459 --> 02:12:42.999]  How many of you listening right now are crying?
[02:12:43.039 --> 02:12:43.999]  You remember that day.
[02:12:44.019 --> 02:12:47.821]  Imagine the evil!
[02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:50.842]  I get chills right now.
[02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:53.202]  I just want to beat the daylights out of somebody.
[02:12:53.723 --> 02:12:55.703]  Hurting children makes me mad.
[02:12:55.943 --> 02:12:57.344]  My instinct is to protect them!
[02:12:58.484 --> 02:13:00.645]  And my instinct got a lot stronger after I had children.
[02:13:02.259 --> 02:13:06.501]  And I've been in a hotel on vacation in the hot tub talking to a mother who's got her autistic child.
[02:13:06.861 --> 02:13:14.264]  And I go, let me guess, at 18 months, at two years, a year and a half to two years, this happened, the third round, yes, yes.
[02:13:14.884 --> 02:13:22.767]  I've talked to the parents where the child gets the shot and by the time they get home they're having a seizure and the baby's brain is gone.
[02:13:23.848 --> 02:13:31.891]  And the hospital doesn't even tell them there's a detox that if you do in the first few weeks will probably reduce the brain damaging and they can come out of it.
[02:13:33.643 --> 02:13:34.823]  But you gotta get it out quick.
[02:13:37.585 --> 02:13:38.325]  This is sick!
[02:13:39.786 --> 02:13:40.566]  This is sick!
[02:13:43.587 --> 02:13:51.690]  The vast majority, and you've heard the medical doctors here, the vast majority are at the third round of shots.
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:14:00.454]  Now, we then see it in adults who have had more than three years consecutive flu shots.
[02:14:02.355 --> 02:14:02.515]  The
[02:14:03.943 --> 02:14:17.007]  The premature onset of dementia, which again, in a growing brain, going through neurological development, will totally fry them and you'll get an autistic child, in whatever degree that is.
[02:14:17.347 --> 02:14:24.349]  In the old, they've already developed their neural pathway, so you're just going to see a cognitive lowering or a general retardation.
[02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:32.251]  And I have, I was at the radio station this weekend, there was a guy there, and he was doing vaccine news,
[02:14:33.208 --> 02:14:36.711]  You know, I heard him chuffing and puffing when I came out, because there's a delay on it.
[02:14:37.031 --> 02:14:41.134]  I was talking about how deadly vaccines were, because he's told me how he likes, you know, to get the flu shot every year.
[02:14:41.634 --> 02:14:44.276]  And I just, I just want to, I want to help people.
[02:14:44.296 --> 02:14:49.520]  It's like a firefighter wants you to get, you know, he has an instinct, she has an instinct to help you.
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:50.901]  I just want to help people!
[02:14:53.433 --> 02:14:58.417]  I mean, I'm, you know, brought up, uh, type of dad who stopped and changed everybody's tires when he needed help.
[02:14:58.477 --> 02:15:00.118]  I mean, I'm just a, I'm just a fool.
[02:15:00.698 --> 02:15:02.459]  I'm just a, a, a soft touch.
[02:15:02.559 --> 02:15:03.440]  I'm a nice guy!
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:04.601]  Big teddy bear!
[02:15:05.181 --> 02:15:05.742]  I'm mad!
[02:15:05.762 --> 02:15:09.264]  I mean, you can't even help these people!
[02:15:09.664 --> 02:15:10.745]  They don't want to be helped!
[02:15:11.125 --> 02:15:12.286]  They want to die young!
[02:15:12.767 --> 02:15:13.907]  They want to die in pain!
[02:15:14.328 --> 02:15:16.009]  They want to die with their brain gone!
[02:15:20.416 --> 02:15:32.622]  There is no debating that we had 1 in 24,000 children having it 25 years ago, and the numbers from 2 years ago are now old, and they're being officially collated.
[02:15:32.642 --> 02:15:36.444]  The old numbers were 1 in 168, now has autism.
[02:15:36.764 --> 02:15:37.784]  That's not over-reporting.
[02:15:38.145 --> 02:15:39.785]  They didn't exist 50 years ago, folks.
[02:15:39.805 --> 02:15:42.907]  Now, every public school has whole rooms full of poor autistic children.
[02:15:43.027 --> 02:15:44.388]  You know it, I know it, we've all seen it.
[02:15:44.608 --> 02:15:45.288]  We've got the numbers.
[02:15:45.328 --> 02:15:47.289]  But you can, not just the numbers, you can see it!
[02:15:50.248 --> 02:15:55.249]  The new numbers are coming out, and I've seen two different spreads, because they released preliminary before it happens.
[02:15:55.969 --> 02:15:58.430]  They're now saying autism is going to be between 1 in 76 and 105.
[02:15:58.630 --> 02:16:03.471]  Because there's a debate looking at the numbers, but they'll be official soon.
[02:16:05.852 --> 02:16:07.092]  You know it's going to get to 1 in 50.
[02:16:09.193 --> 02:16:09.573]  And 1 in 30.
[02:16:11.113 --> 02:16:11.473]  And 1 in 20.
[02:16:12.373 --> 02:16:18.415]  And they'll just keep telling you, all is good, keep taking the shot, keep taking the mercury, or there's no mercury in there, take it!
[02:16:19.252 --> 02:16:24.375]  When they've increased the mercury in the vaccines, and now other drugs.
[02:16:26.616 --> 02:16:39.003]  So, if you don't have a passion to warn people... I mean, right now, if down the street, somebody's house was on fire, and I knew about it, and I knew somebody wanted help, and I'd leave, you know, it's not anything special, I'd go help them!
[02:16:39.063 --> 02:16:39.743]  I'd go warn them!
[02:16:41.884 --> 02:16:47.127]  If you knew somebody was about to drink, you know, some cola with poison in it, you'd go warn them.
[02:16:49.508 --> 02:16:53.972]  But no, we're just supposed to sit here and take it, because our government wouldn't do it to us.
[02:16:53.992 --> 02:16:55.713]  Yeah, it's a huge eugenics program.
[02:16:56.814 --> 02:17:02.219]  Aldous Huxley, before he died in 62 at Berkeley, said that everything he put in the book was what the eugenicists had actually planned.
[02:17:02.239 --> 02:17:03.640]  He wrote the book in 33!
[02:17:05.142 --> 02:17:06.203]  And it's all coming true today!
[02:17:06.223 --> 02:17:10.867]  You know, where they x-ray the eggs before they're implanted to have a dumbed-down cast.
[02:17:12.608 --> 02:17:13.729]  People's whole potential!
[02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:15.571]  Being robbed!
[02:17:18.101 --> 02:17:20.001]  Autistic children everywhere!
[02:17:22.102 --> 02:17:26.543]  Advanced early onset of dementia in people 45, 50, 60 years old!
[02:17:28.183 --> 02:17:35.604]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:39.325 --> 02:17:41.666]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[02:17:50.204 --> 02:17:50.644]  A 5% increase.
[02:17:50.684 --> 02:17:53.125]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:17:53.145 --> 02:17:55.005]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:17:55.025 --> 02:17:56.486]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[02:17:56.506 --> 02:17:57.966]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:18:13.786 --> 02:18:16.807]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:19:38.017 --> 02:19:40.498]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:41.038 --> 02:19:48.040]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the Communist world in the last days?
[02:19:49.001 --> 02:19:54.603]  Did you know that it predicts the confrontation between atheistic communism and the Western world of Christianity?
[02:19:55.343 --> 02:19:58.744]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.

[02:20:39.269 --> 02:20:43.390]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:45.371]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:20:45.651 --> 02:20:51.933]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:20:52.213 --> 02:20:58.334]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:20:58.594 --> 02:21:00.435]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:21:00.715 --> 02:21:00.996]  I think?

[02:21:27.296 --> 02:21:27.356]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:48.646]  Welcome back!
[02:22:12.692 --> 02:22:19.674]  Last hour we had former naval officer, former FBI agent retired, grandson of Admiral Kimmel exposing how that was all provocateur and a fraud.
[02:22:19.694 --> 02:22:22.075]  And I tell you, I haven't read the whole book.
[02:22:22.095 --> 02:22:23.015]  I got it about two days ago.
[02:22:23.035 --> 02:22:25.916]  I've scanned through it, read a few chapters, got a lot of things marked here.
[02:22:26.356 --> 02:22:28.417]  I like a book that starts with Thomas Jefferson quotes.
[02:22:29.077 --> 02:22:30.658]  It's the Constitution in Exile.
[02:22:30.678 --> 02:22:32.038]  It's just out in the last few months.
[02:22:32.678 --> 02:22:36.159]  Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, probably no stranger to this audience.
[02:22:36.179 --> 02:22:40.941]  He's been all over national TV, contributed to Fox News, Fox News senior judicial analyst.
[02:22:41.673 --> 02:22:43.454]  And we are honored to have him on.
[02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:45.814]  In 1972, he graduated from Princeton University.
[02:22:46.135 --> 02:22:49.196]  In 1975, he graduated from the University of Notre Dame Law School.
[02:22:49.256 --> 02:22:54.217]  Judge Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of the state of New Jersey.
[02:22:54.558 --> 02:22:55.878]  For 11 years, he was adjunct.
[02:22:56.576 --> 02:23:04.618]  Professor of Law at Seton Hall Law School, where he taught Constitutional Law and Jurisprudence, and was thrice voted Most Outstanding Professor.
[02:23:05.018 --> 02:23:08.459]  Judge Napolitano returned to private law practice in 1995.
[02:23:09.079 --> 02:23:13.020]  Yeah, you know, I watch Fox News sometimes and I just think, you know, this is out of control.
[02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:17.701]  The police state that's pushed, trying to say Bush is a conservative when he's about as conservative as a
[02:23:18.297 --> 02:23:19.158]  That's Bill Clinton.
[02:23:19.878 --> 02:23:21.159]  But then I see Napolitano.
[02:23:21.219 --> 02:23:23.780]  It's like this vein of sanity is found.
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:24.921]  And then I read the book.
[02:23:24.981 --> 02:23:25.841]  It's even more hardcore.
[02:23:25.861 --> 02:23:35.046]  I heard Gary Brownfield on this same Genesis Network a few months ago talk about some meeting he was at where he gave a speech and saw Napolitano gave a speech and was impressed by him.
[02:23:35.946 --> 02:23:38.488]  And here we have him with us for a little bit of time today.
[02:23:39.208 --> 02:23:43.911]  And again, I haven't read the whole book yet, but it's something you certainly should get because
[02:23:45.356 --> 02:23:49.898]  Because it's powerful and very well written, and nice and handsome as well.
[02:23:50.218 --> 02:23:51.998]  Judge, thanks for spending some time with us.
[02:23:52.158 --> 02:23:54.159]  Well, Alex, it's a pleasure to be on with you.
[02:23:54.339 --> 02:23:56.059]  You know I do some radio as well.
[02:23:56.099 --> 02:24:03.102]  I don't have the following or the reputation that the great Alex Jones has, but it's an absolute delight to be on with you.
[02:24:03.162 --> 02:24:13.125]  And I discovered recently that we have a lot of mutual friends who share the view that you so nicely articulated that the government is the enemy.
[02:24:13.895 --> 02:24:20.461]  And as Ronald Reagan once said, the nine most dangerous words in the English language are, I'm from the government, I'm here to help you.
[02:24:21.542 --> 02:24:27.006]  Well, I'll tell you, the last two days I've read three or four chapters, I've scanned through a lot of it.
[02:24:27.046 --> 02:24:30.349]  You know how it is, it's midnight, you've got to get to sleep, but you want to finish reading it.
[02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:31.790]  But it's a powerful book.
[02:24:32.050 --> 02:24:34.853]  Again, I love a book that starts with Thomas Jefferson quotes.
[02:24:34.873 --> 02:24:36.914]  Tell us why you wrote this book.
[02:24:36.934 --> 02:24:37.955]  That's a great question.
[02:24:37.975 --> 02:24:38.856]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:24:38.956 --> 02:24:39.757]  I wrote the book.
[02:24:40.342 --> 02:24:58.057]  Because we are in an era where the federal government controls so many aspects of our lives, from where you can build your house, to how big your toilet bowls are, to the number of lobsters you can catch in the ocean, to the amount of sugar you can put in ketchup and still call it ketchup.
[02:24:58.538 --> 02:25:04.763]  People need to know that the vast majority of authority that the federal government has
[02:25:05.288 --> 02:25:09.030]  It's simply seized from the states and from individuals.
[02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:12.592]  It is nowhere countenanced in the Constitution.
[02:25:13.012 --> 02:25:25.739]  The federal government, starting with Abraham Lincoln, pursuing up to FDR, and continuing on to LBJ and George W. Bush, and I've just named the four greatest violators of the Constitution.
[02:25:25.759 --> 02:25:27.040]  There were many, many others.
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.381]  It'd be difficult to find a president who didn't.
[02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:32.983]  Even my beloved Jefferson, but we can talk about that later.
[02:25:33.359 --> 02:25:49.043]  But those four presidents, in leaps and bounds, destroyed individual initiative, destroyed individual liberty, destroyed the rights of the states, and created an enormous bureaucratic monstrosity in Washington, D.C.
[02:25:49.403 --> 02:25:54.244]  that exists primarily only to provide jobs and power for itself.
[02:25:54.684 --> 02:25:57.325]  And now the parasite is killing the Golden Goose.
[02:25:57.765 --> 02:26:01.606]  It has grown to be bigger than even its host.
[02:26:02.842 --> 02:26:10.596]  Well, it is so big and so out of control, there's probably not a single person on the planet who's read the tax code.
[02:26:11.077 --> 02:26:12.600]  It's 40,000 pages long.
[02:26:15.529 --> 02:26:20.511]  There probably is not a single accountant or law professor who's read the entire code.
[02:26:20.551 --> 02:26:21.751]  Everybody reads it somewhere.
[02:26:21.811 --> 02:26:23.772]  Money Magazine, what, about 10 years ago?
[02:26:23.832 --> 02:26:27.033]  They went to 15 different top tax firms and they all gave different answers?
[02:26:27.373 --> 02:26:28.093]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:28.113 --> 02:26:43.998]  Look, when I was doing research for this book, The Constitution in Exile, and for its predecessor, Constitutional Chaos, and when I was doing research for the speech that your friend made some kind comments about, my research was on the Patriot Act, I discovered
[02:26:44.810 --> 02:26:51.534]  That when the Patriot Act was voted on in the House of Representatives, no one in the House had a copy of it to read.
[02:26:51.554 --> 02:26:53.976]  And I thought, well, gee, that's really peculiar.
[02:26:53.996 --> 02:26:57.138]  I mean, here you have an act that tinkers with the Constitution.
[02:26:57.258 --> 02:26:58.099]  Oh, yeah, Ron Hall!
[02:26:58.119 --> 02:26:58.639]  Ron Hall!
[02:26:58.659 --> 02:27:00.920]  That's not naming a post office.
[02:27:01.281 --> 02:27:04.323]  This is altering the Constitution, and these guys haven't read it.
[02:27:04.723 --> 02:27:14.209]  Then I found out that in doing more and more research, it's very common for members of Congress not to read the laws that they enact, but simply to rely on summaries of it
[02:27:14.565 --> 02:27:16.566]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:16.606 --> 02:27:18.887]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:46.169 --> 02:30:51.450]  The book opens with, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:55.691]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:30:57.551 --> 02:31:05.153]  And we look at what this country's turned into today, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst,
[02:31:06.388 --> 02:31:16.338]  The Constitution in Exile, I mean, this is a honest book, and from a high-powered authority on constitutional law, about how basically the Constitution isn't in tatters.
[02:31:16.378 --> 02:31:20.282]  It was flushed down the tubes a long time ago, but we can get it back.
[02:31:20.343 --> 02:31:22.545]  It beats and lives in our heart.
[02:31:24.079 --> 02:31:25.780]  Judge, I want to continue with the Patriot Act.
[02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:29.521]  There's people trying to push for laws like Read the Bills Act, make them read them.
[02:31:29.941 --> 02:31:36.124]  The foreign lobbyists in many cases now, and they're the majority of the lobbyists, are there writing the laws.
[02:31:36.404 --> 02:31:41.606]  Ron Paul told us that 30 minutes before they passed the Patriot Act, October 27, 2001, they issued it.
[02:31:41.626 --> 02:31:43.787]  And it was 400 plus pages long, by the way, boys and girls.
[02:31:48.001 --> 02:31:49.341]  And that, by the way, that was committee.
[02:31:49.462 --> 02:31:51.242]  Chairman were given it 30 minutes before.
[02:31:51.262 --> 02:31:58.024]  He said about 20 minutes before the vote, he was, and then he had his people waiting, he had to stay up late at night.
[02:31:58.504 --> 02:32:04.066]  And then they announced it, they ran in, they gave it to him, he had 20 minutes, and then he just went out and voted against it.
[02:32:04.806 --> 02:32:06.707]  Is that what you're talking about, Judge Napolitano?
[02:32:07.287 --> 02:32:09.668]  Alex, even, and let me say a word about Ron Paul.
[02:32:10.228 --> 02:32:16.250]  He's the finest member of Congress in modern times, and one of the few, and he fortunately has
[02:32:16.903 --> 02:32:18.665]  About two dozen who agree with him.
[02:32:18.745 --> 02:32:20.226]  Unfortunately, the number is so small.
[02:32:20.327 --> 02:32:27.314]  One of you who understands the true role of the federal government in the Founding Fathers scheme and the Constitution.
[02:32:27.634 --> 02:32:28.975]  Ron is 100% correct.
[02:32:29.256 --> 02:32:34.521]  And even if he were a speed reader, you can't read the 400 pages like you'd read a novel.
[02:32:35.003 --> 02:32:38.244]  Because in order to read it, and I've read it, but it took me several days to do so.
[02:32:38.264 --> 02:32:39.325]  You've got to go look up the U.S.
[02:32:39.365 --> 02:32:39.605]  Code.
[02:32:40.065 --> 02:32:40.685]  Precisely.
[02:32:40.865 --> 02:32:44.066]  It refers you to various sections of the U.S.
[02:32:44.126 --> 02:32:50.969]  Code, and it says things like, change AND to OR, change FIFTEEN to TWENTY, change the COMMA to the SEMICOLON.
[02:32:51.009 --> 02:32:58.552]  So you've got to sort of re-handwrite that out, or throw it up on your laptop screen, and then understand what the new sentence means.
[02:32:58.832 --> 02:33:01.213]  But the bottom line of the Patriot Act is,
[02:33:01.937 --> 02:33:07.481]  It allows federal agents to write their own search warrants.
[02:33:08.021 --> 02:33:17.707]  They no longer have to go to a judge if they want your financial information, if they want information from your doctor, if they want information about you from your lawyer.
[02:33:17.747 --> 02:33:20.429]  And they're using it in non-terror related cases?
[02:33:20.789 --> 02:33:21.489]  Absolutely.
[02:33:21.749 --> 02:33:24.131]  Ask me how many convictions
[02:33:24.611 --> 02:33:32.217]  The federal government has obtained from a jury in a federal court on the basis of information obtained under the Patriot Act.
[02:33:32.277 --> 02:33:33.638]  It's a very easy answer.
[02:33:34.159 --> 02:33:34.659]  Zero.
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.482]  No terrorist convictions obtained.
[02:33:37.762 --> 02:33:45.428]  They've gotten convictions for distribution of pornography, for political corruption, for distribution of judges, for distribution of drugs.
[02:33:45.548 --> 02:33:54.155]  I'm not necessarily in favor of those acts, but the promise that Attorney General John Ashcroft made, we need this so badly we can't
[02:33:54.710 --> 02:34:03.315]  Give you time to read it because we have to go after the terrorists and we'll only use it for terrorism as a promise that wasn't even worth the breath that he spoke when he articulated it.
[02:34:03.335 --> 02:34:04.996]  Well, we don't have a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:34:05.036 --> 02:34:05.957]  We don't have a country.
[02:34:06.237 --> 02:34:06.757]  No, we don't.
[02:34:07.117 --> 02:34:11.640]  And anybody that voted for the Patriot Act, even a so-called conservative Republican,
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:13.141]  It's inherent.
[02:34:13.161 --> 02:34:13.781]  It's organic.
[02:34:13.801 --> 02:34:14.582]  I mean... Correct.
[02:34:14.642 --> 02:34:18.465]  What I'm likened it to is, 200 years ago, a slave owner had a right to beat a slave to death.
[02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:38.895]  But, inherently, in just natural law, that slave wasn't a slave.
[02:34:39.195 --> 02:34:42.800]  He had a right to grab that axe handle away and beat his master's brains out.
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:43.741]  Absolutely.
[02:34:44.322 --> 02:34:44.762]  Absolutely.
[02:34:44.802 --> 02:34:46.004]  Now, no one told him that.
[02:34:46.464 --> 02:34:47.626]  And no one taught him that.
[02:34:47.946 --> 02:34:53.253]  But because slavery is in the category of behavior that is always wrong.
[02:34:53.823 --> 02:34:56.945]  One has the right to use violence against behavior.
[02:34:57.386 --> 02:34:58.747]  That is always wrong.
[02:34:59.167 --> 02:35:07.373]  We have a right to speak freely, to think freely, to worship freely, to travel, to be free from unwanted government intrusion.
[02:35:07.693 --> 02:35:09.454]  Not because the Constitution grants it.
[02:35:09.474 --> 02:35:10.835]  The Constitution doesn't grant it.
[02:35:11.175 --> 02:35:14.958]  The Constitution just says to the government, keep your hands off it.
[02:35:15.338 --> 02:35:17.980]  So anybody who would vote for the Patriot Act,
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:26.062]  The FBI doesn't understand that they don't even have the right or the power to interfere with those rights.
[02:35:26.162 --> 02:35:30.423]  Here's an example, I've been pulled over at a checkpoint, they're stopping, searching everybody, and the state trooper walks up and says, I want to search your car.
[02:35:43.406 --> 02:35:50.372]  And I say, you don't have probable cause, and he says, he pulls out a letter, hands it to me, and says, we have a change in state police policy.
[02:35:50.792 --> 02:35:53.474]  So that's not even a law, now they just say they have policy.
[02:35:53.695 --> 02:35:57.217]  What about bureaucracies just running around, making it up as they go?
[02:35:57.618 --> 02:36:07.846]  There are two attributes that everybody that works for the government shares, whether they're a janitor or a president, whether they're a school teacher or the governor, and everything in between.
[02:36:08.466 --> 02:36:11.689]  One is, they love power, and they love to use it.
[02:36:12.265 --> 02:36:14.106]  The other is, they're lazy.
[02:36:14.126 --> 02:36:21.287]  And they're prepared to cut any corners, even the corners of the Constitution itself, in order to make their job easier.
[02:36:21.367 --> 02:36:22.788]  There is no policy.
[02:36:23.128 --> 02:36:30.990]  There is no person in the country who has the authority to issue a policy that allows them to go into your briefcase or into the trunk of your car.
[02:36:31.450 --> 02:36:41.973]  They have to take you in, present a probable cause to a judge, which they don't have, persuade the judge that it's more likely than not that in your briefcase or in the trunk of your car is evidence of a crime.
[02:36:42.372 --> 02:36:44.594]  We don't have fishing expeditions in this country.
[02:36:44.834 --> 02:36:48.558]  Whether there's policy for it or not, the Constitution prohibits it.
[02:36:48.898 --> 02:36:52.081]  We fought a revolution because the British soldiers used to do that to us.
[02:36:52.201 --> 02:36:52.722]  Exactly.
[02:36:52.782 --> 02:37:01.650]  Now, expanding on that, Judge Napolitano, with the new book, The Constitution in Exile, how the federal government has seized power and is rewriting the supreme law of the land.
[02:37:02.731 --> 02:37:03.732]  Expanding out.
[02:37:03.812 --> 02:37:04.573]  Family courts.
[02:37:04.933 --> 02:37:07.516]  Now, we've got a judge, Gene Muir, right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:21.574]  Who, and I've been in the courts, I've seen it, screams at fathers and mothers and orders them to sign an agreement to adjudicate, to sign over the child's rights to be on probation when the child's literally just been true in a couple days.
[02:37:22.456 --> 02:37:28.841]  And the father says no, and she threatens to arrest him for contempt, and she's compelling him to sign a form.
[02:37:29.101 --> 02:37:30.281]  It's contract fraud.
[02:37:30.762 --> 02:37:38.827]  How does... So, what do we do about these judges that think that they're God and think that they're an imperial court?
[02:37:39.067 --> 02:37:40.909]  Well, there's a couple things that you can do.
[02:37:41.449 --> 02:37:44.351]  One is the bright light of the media, which of course you're doing.
[02:37:45.091 --> 02:37:48.654]  In Texas, the judges are elected, so she could be voted out of office.
[02:37:49.295 --> 02:37:56.999]  Or you can appeal it to an appellate court, but no judge has the right to force you to sign anything against your will, especially if there's not been a trial.
[02:37:57.299 --> 02:38:06.244]  If she's held a trial, and a jury has decided that the child is truant, or the parents can no longer take care of the child, that's a different story.
[02:38:06.564 --> 02:38:13.128]  But for her to say, hey, it's an easy way for me to get rid of this case, is to put this kid in probation, I'm going to order you to consent to it,
[02:38:13.508 --> 02:38:14.569]  She doesn't have the right to do it.
[02:38:14.789 --> 02:38:19.214]  That's like her asking you to consent to give up your First Amendment freedoms.
[02:38:19.674 --> 02:38:22.336]  No judge has the power to compel you to do that.
[02:38:22.757 --> 02:38:28.102]  It would take a very courageous person to resist her, but I would argue that that's what should be done.
[02:38:28.679 --> 02:38:33.082]  Isn't that one of the key earmarks?
[02:38:33.122 --> 02:38:34.343]  A signature of tyranny?
[02:38:34.623 --> 02:38:42.429]  To have someone in a black robe, screaming and ordering someone to waive their rights and contractually sign into something that they haven't been convicted of?
[02:38:42.489 --> 02:38:48.694]  If you can get the old black and white footage of what criminal trials were like in Nazi Germany, that's what you'll see.
[02:38:48.734 --> 02:38:50.395]  Many of the judges were maniacal.
[02:38:51.101 --> 02:38:54.323]  And screamed and yelled at defendants and got them to give up their rights.
[02:38:54.364 --> 02:38:55.885]  There were very, very few fair trials.
[02:38:55.925 --> 02:38:57.366]  They weren't interested in fair trials.
[02:38:57.826 --> 02:39:02.590]  Even with Nazis on the jury, they were worried that defendants might get acquitted.
[02:39:02.930 --> 02:39:06.533]  So their goal was to browbeat defendants into some kind of a submission in the courtroom.
[02:39:06.553 --> 02:39:08.294]  That's what it sounds like it's happening in Texas.
[02:39:08.794 --> 02:39:12.837]  Texas has the most corrupt judicial system in the country.
[02:39:12.917 --> 02:39:14.158]  I don't mean the judges are being bribed.
[02:39:14.178 --> 02:39:15.239]  That's not what I mean by corrupt.
[02:39:15.646 --> 02:39:28.336]  By corrupt, I mean decisions based on other than the merits of the case and judges doing things in order to further their careers in the judiciary rather than doing what's right in the courtroom.
[02:39:28.756 --> 02:39:41.746]  Until you get a system where politics is out of the judiciary, where this judge is more interested in pleasing the editorial writers or the voters who would advance her to a higher court, you're never going to have a pure system of justice.
[02:39:42.094 --> 02:39:46.716]  What would you do if you saw, I know you know judges like this, what do you do when you see them at a cocktail party or an event?
[02:39:46.736 --> 02:39:49.637]  I mean, do you go, shame on you, or do you try to talk sense into them?
[02:39:49.657 --> 02:39:55.619]  Well, when I see a judge at a cocktail party or an event, I do, but I'm in a little bit of a different position.
[02:39:55.639 --> 02:40:02.041]  I mean, I was a life tenure judge in New Jersey, and now I'm on television two or three times a day, and everybody calls me your honor.
[02:40:02.061 --> 02:40:09.024]  It's difficult for your ordinary lawyer to do that, but I'm in a position where I can get away with it, and frequently I do take advantage of that.
[02:40:11.837 --> 02:40:12.878]  Let's say they're listening right now.
[02:40:12.918 --> 02:40:15.659]  What do you say to them about not destroying America?
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:24.704]  I remind them that they are the last line of defense that we have between tyranny and freedom.
[02:40:25.224 --> 02:40:31.808]  Because if the President thinks that he can shine into law bills that would take away our freedoms,
[02:40:32.256 --> 02:40:54.231]  And if the Congress thinks that it can enact laws that would cut the Constitution, it is only my former colleagues in black robes who would say to the President, and say to the Congress, or say to the Legislature, or the Governor of Texas, and I'm not necessarily picking on them, I'm just using this hypothetical, the Constitution is supreme, and you are not.
[02:40:54.611 --> 02:40:57.453]  It takes great courage to be a judge and do the right thing.
[02:40:57.753 --> 02:41:01.376]  And you must remember, your oath is not to the government.
[02:41:01.696 --> 02:41:03.798]  Your oath is to the Constitution.
[02:41:04.218 --> 02:41:07.681]  And you are the last line of defense in a civilized society.
[02:41:07.701 --> 02:41:13.165]  Well, I had a nice retired FBI agent on Admiral Kimmel's grandson talking about Pearl Harbor in the last hour.
[02:41:13.645 --> 02:41:16.087]  What they did to Admiral Kimmel, they shouldn't have done to a dog.
[02:41:16.467 --> 02:41:19.049]  I didn't hear what the grandson said, but I'm sure I'll agree with him.
[02:41:19.951 --> 02:41:21.532]  Well, yeah, I mean, I certainly agree with him, too.
[02:41:21.552 --> 02:41:26.675]  My point is, in his bio, it says, you know, I served the government.
[02:41:28.436 --> 02:41:30.317]  No, no, you were serving the American people.
[02:41:30.557 --> 02:41:36.380]  But why do we call elected representatives officials, authorities?
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:40.102]  I mean, isn't that part of also this tyrannizing of the country?
[02:41:40.622 --> 02:41:44.584]  Part of the tyrannizing of the country is the things that Ron Paul was talking about.
[02:41:45.044 --> 02:41:49.386]  When the Congress enacts a statute, they can't find a place in the Constitution where it's authorized.
[02:41:49.646 --> 02:41:51.167]  They don't have the time to read it.
[02:41:51.527 --> 02:41:58.450]  They assume that they are immune from what they do and what they say, and that there's no consequences for what they do and say.
[02:41:58.930 --> 02:42:09.695]  We need to return to a system of government of citizen legislators, where the legislature meets maybe one or two months a year, where people rotate in and out, where there is no permanent
[02:42:10.335 --> 02:42:13.216]  You're talking about a Jeffersonian system?
[02:42:13.556 --> 02:42:14.157]  Absolutely.
[02:42:14.457 --> 02:42:14.777]  Absolutely.
[02:42:14.817 --> 02:42:21.539]  Because absent the Jeffersonian system, human liberty will decrease and the power of the state will increase.
[02:42:21.899 --> 02:42:23.920]  And only a revolution can stop that.
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:25.101]  And isn't it exponential?
[02:42:25.161 --> 02:42:34.644]  I mean, government and big systems has a gravitational well where it's so large it will always expand until there is a revolution.
[02:42:34.664 --> 02:42:36.725]  Do you think we've passed that point of no return?
[02:42:37.245 --> 02:42:39.268]  I don't think we've passed the point of no return.
[02:42:39.668 --> 02:42:49.279]  It would take a lot of people who think like you and Ron Paul and a lot of your listeners and I, but there are some practical things that can be done and I talk about them in the Constitution in exile.
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:54.726]  We can get rid of the 16th Amendment, which would starve the government to death because that's what allows them to tax income.
[02:42:55.126 --> 02:43:04.434]  We can get rid of the 17th Amendment, which would require that state legislatures elect senators rather than people, so they're there in the best interest of the state.
[02:43:04.694 --> 02:43:11.640]  We can enact term limits so that nobody can be in the government for more than one or two terms, and we can remind everybody
[02:43:12.136 --> 02:43:18.538]  But the 10th Amendment says that that which has not been given to the feds is reserved for the states.
[02:43:18.938 --> 02:43:21.519]  We should put the word expressly given to the feds.
[02:43:21.779 --> 02:43:23.839]  Just a couple of simple changes and we've got it done.
[02:43:24.219 --> 02:43:30.721]  Well the level of corruption and fraud, here's another example when we talk about Military Commissions Act and the Defense Authorization Act and FEMA camps.
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:38.767]  Another example of lawlessness, through the PR firms every year before school, they announce, it's the law, you've got to take vaccines or you'll be arrested.
[02:43:39.127 --> 02:43:40.208]  Now, there is no law.
[02:43:40.548 --> 02:43:45.813]  What there is, is a waiver that they would like for you to sign as a, quote, policy.
[02:43:45.853 --> 02:43:53.440]  What they do is, they then expel you, then use the truancy law, which they triggered by expelling you, to then arrest the pupil.
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:58.324]  I mean, what would you call that bizarre color of law, gyration of
[02:43:59.205 --> 02:44:01.787]  I would call that constitutional chaos.
[02:44:01.847 --> 02:44:10.174]  I would call that the government breaking Law A so that they can force you to obey a non-Law B. I mean, that's not even breaking the law in order to enforce it.
[02:44:10.234 --> 02:44:15.138]  That's breaking the law in order to compel behavior, which they don't have the authority to compel.
[02:44:15.659 --> 02:44:20.423]  One of my big beefs, and my new book which will be out this summer is called A Nation of Sheep.
[02:44:21.067 --> 02:44:25.610]  It's the unwillingness of people to challenge the government.
[02:44:25.851 --> 02:44:28.132]  Why do we assume that the government is right?
[02:44:28.152 --> 02:44:30.714]  The government is almost always wrong!
[02:44:30.954 --> 02:44:32.936]  And the American people need to understand that!
[02:44:33.156 --> 02:44:35.818]  The burden of proof should be on the government to prove that it's right!
[02:44:36.198 --> 02:44:39.242]  Not on the citizens that they abuse to prove that it's wrong.
[02:44:39.262 --> 02:44:39.823]  Well, I agree.
[02:44:39.863 --> 02:44:43.087]  This is all absolute wisdom, constitutional, right down the line.
[02:44:43.107 --> 02:44:48.634]  You know, my producer Kevin Smith went up to me on Fox News a few weeks ago because I couldn't make it because of family engagements.
[02:44:48.995 --> 02:44:52.799]  And he was debating this very nice firefighter on the show in Mankow.
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:45:05.568]  And the firefighter, Kevin said, the firefighter said, well you're saying the government's bad, you know, that destroys America, you know, the government is America, and it's good, and now you're hurting it.
[02:45:05.948 --> 02:45:18.096]  And Kevin said, no, no, no, the founding father said, you know, the government's the people, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, you shouldn't just do whatever the government says, you shouldn't trust it, you should never trust it, and they both looked at him like he had 14 heads, and they went,
[02:45:18.616 --> 02:45:20.938]  You're saying the government isn't good?
[02:45:21.158 --> 02:45:22.839]  You're saying we shouldn't do whatever it says?
[02:45:23.059 --> 02:45:29.584]  I mean, how did Americans get to the point where what was common sense 50 years ago is out the window?
[02:45:30.702 --> 02:45:41.850]  The monster called public education, the monster called teachers unions, we've all been fed since 99% of us went to public schools, grammar and high school, we've all been fed the same nonsense.
[02:45:42.190 --> 02:45:52.097]  Why does everybody believe that the biggest criminal in the history of the United States of America, who murdered more than 600,000 of his fellow Americans, Abraham Lincoln, is the greatest president in history?
[02:45:52.477 --> 02:45:54.999]  Because the teachers unions and public education
[02:45:55.399 --> 02:45:59.922]  Have brainwashed us into believing that this kind of big government is a good thing.
[02:46:00.142 --> 02:46:02.844]  And you know, saying something like that... It's what actually brought us to our knees.
[02:46:02.984 --> 02:46:04.045]  Sure, saying something like that.
[02:46:04.065 --> 02:46:05.786]  They destroyed the Republic.
[02:46:06.086 --> 02:46:07.887]  He destroyed states' rights, the Tenth Amendment.
[02:46:08.488 --> 02:46:11.830]  And what happened after they killed him was even worse during Reconstruction.
[02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:13.791]  Of course, he did it to, quote, preserve the Union.
[02:46:13.831 --> 02:46:17.313]  But you're right, he arrested legislators, newspaper editors in the North.
[02:46:17.894 --> 02:46:19.975]  And he said it had nothing to do with black slaves.
[02:46:19.995 --> 02:46:21.136]  He said that in speeches.
[02:46:21.736 --> 02:46:29.639]  He was actually in favor of what would have been the 13th Amendment to the United States, which would have prohibited the federal government from interfering with slavery.
[02:46:30.039 --> 02:46:33.240]  He was in favor of anything that would have preserved his own power.
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:41.202]  He was no more interested in eradicating slavery than he was jumping over the moon, unless it suited his contemporary political needs.
[02:46:41.603 --> 02:46:48.685]  There came a time in the Civil War when he and the Cabinet decided, aha, if we free the slaves now, there'll be too much of a burden on the South and we'll win this war.
[02:46:49.574 --> 02:46:53.277]  And then he formed armies and sent them south, and it was not retribution.
[02:46:53.337 --> 02:46:54.778]  It was insane.
[02:46:55.899 --> 02:47:01.824]  Well, I tell you, this has been an unbelievable interview, and I want to get you back on for a full hour in the near future.
[02:47:02.244 --> 02:47:12.252]  It's the Constitution in Exile, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, and you can also go to his website and find out more about his radio show he does nationally.
[02:47:12.653 --> 02:47:15.915]  It's JudgeNap.com, JudgeNAP.com.
[02:47:16.215 --> 02:47:17.757]  In closing, in the last minute and a half,
[02:47:18.337 --> 02:47:20.758]  The Military Commissions Act does affect citizens.
[02:47:20.818 --> 02:47:21.279]  I've read it.
[02:47:21.339 --> 02:47:22.579]  The law scholars have looked at it.
[02:47:23.020 --> 02:47:24.460]  What they do is they change the definition.
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:25.901]  They say, well, you're no longer American.
[02:47:26.161 --> 02:47:28.082]  We say now you're an enemy combatant.
[02:47:28.102 --> 02:47:30.544]  And then they play the trick of saying, now you're a foreigner.
[02:47:31.344 --> 02:47:38.448]  And then we also have the Defense Authorization Act, which makes Bush total dictator over the states in time of crises or insurrection.
[02:47:38.648 --> 02:47:39.429]  Can you comment on that?
[02:47:39.809 --> 02:47:40.069]  Sure.
[02:47:40.569 --> 02:47:43.691]  And there are many, many defects in that statute, but I'll give you one of the worst.
[02:47:44.241 --> 02:47:49.387]  If you were tried before a jury and found not guilty, you'd expect to be set free.
[02:47:50.128 --> 02:47:57.858]  The Military Commission Act of 2006 allows George Bush to lock you up and keep you in jail even after you've been acquitted.
[02:47:58.647 --> 02:48:08.673]  Even Hitler and Stalin and Mao, the great monsters of the 20th century, never claimed that power, and the Congress just gave it to whoever is the President.
[02:48:08.913 --> 02:48:14.296]  It's one of the most outrageous violations of human liberty ever enacted, and the public isn't even aware of it.
[02:48:14.336 --> 02:48:16.577]  What about the bizarre statement in the bill saying,
[02:48:17.336 --> 02:48:19.900]  Judges can't question its rulings.
[02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:25.387]  I believe that that's going to be overturned, hard to believe, by a Democratic Congress.
[02:48:25.948 --> 02:48:28.371]  You know, I've got one more short little segment.
[02:48:28.391 --> 02:48:30.634]  Stay for a three minute break and then one minute on the other side.
[02:48:30.934 --> 02:48:33.277]  I want to hear more about that because that was in the news today.
[02:48:33.598 --> 02:48:34.359]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:48:41.138 --> 02:48:44.319]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:44.679 --> 02:48:46.619]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:46.979 --> 02:48:54.661]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:55.321 --> 02:49:02.362]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:02.763 --> 02:49:09.624]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:14.181]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:14.501 --> 02:49:18.122]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:18.482 --> 02:49:20.363]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:20.723 --> 02:49:24.644]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:16.699 --> 02:50:17.499]  And, wow!

[02:51:44.002 --> 02:51:46.583]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:51:46.623 --> 02:51:48.943]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:51:49.023 --> 02:51:52.184]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:51:52.204 --> 02:51:55.744]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:51:57.425 --> 02:51:59.445]  Big John.
[02:52:00.205 --> 02:52:02.486]  Big John.
[02:52:03.026 --> 02:52:04.626]  Big Bab John.
[02:52:05.926 --> 02:52:06.967]  Big John.
[02:52:09.093 --> 02:52:37.712]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home He just drifted into town and stayed all alone Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy But he spoke it all, he just said hi, Big John Somebody said he came from New Orleans Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen And a crashing blow from a huge right hand Sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John Welcome back, glad that you've joined us The show is almost over
[02:52:38.994 --> 02:52:41.296]  I was talking to Judge Napolitano about Judge Jean Meary.
[02:52:41.316 --> 02:52:44.578]  Couldn't believe they named a huge building after her while she's in office.
[02:52:45.139 --> 02:52:46.380]  He wants information on her.
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:49.802]  People all over Central Texas, he's talking about doing a piece on her.
[02:52:49.862 --> 02:52:58.209]  Go to his website, JudgeNap.com, or just type in Judge Napolitano into a search engine, get his website, and you can contact him, send him emails.
[02:52:58.569 --> 02:52:59.530]  Send all the dirt on her.
[02:53:00.370 --> 02:53:01.991]  And there's so much it'll make your head spin.
[02:53:02.931 --> 02:53:05.033]  That's great, because they do pieces on those.
[02:53:05.053 --> 02:53:06.934]  We're really honored to have him with us.
[02:53:06.994 --> 02:53:09.655]  He does do a syndicated radio program on the weekends.
[02:53:09.715 --> 02:53:11.616]  It's called Brian and the Judge.
[02:53:11.956 --> 02:53:12.937]  More details on his website.
[02:53:13.157 --> 02:53:16.539]  In closing, that Military Commissions Act, yeah, it's full of nightmares.
[02:53:16.999 --> 02:53:18.400]  It changes the definition of torture.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:20.561]  You think we've got a good chance of overturning that?
[02:53:21.722 --> 02:53:23.463]  I think we have a good chance of overturning it.
[02:53:23.483 --> 02:53:29.686]  I never thought that the Democrats would be our salvation of liberty, but so many of them got so personally irked by the way
[02:53:30.599 --> 02:53:54.439]  The Bush administration treated the Congress as if it were a mere constitutional nuisance during its first six years, but now that they control it, for example, Senator Arlen Specter, a liberal Republican, but the present chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Pat Leahy, a liberal Democrat, but the soon-to-be chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have together introduced legislation to restore habeas corpus rights
[02:53:54.966 --> 02:53:59.028]  To those who we arrest in foreign lands to Guantanamo Bay.
[02:53:59.228 --> 02:54:01.489]  And that is the genius of separation of powers.
[02:54:01.569 --> 02:54:09.513]  Even though power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and centralized power is a threat, the different branches will fight over the power and that will keep a man on a white horse.
[02:54:09.854 --> 02:54:11.454]  At least that's the theory from taking over.
[02:54:11.775 --> 02:54:13.255]  Judge, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:54:13.275 --> 02:54:13.976]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:54:14.176 --> 02:54:14.776]  Pleasure, Alex.
[02:54:14.836 --> 02:54:15.397]  God bless you.
[02:54:15.677 --> 02:54:16.097]  Take care.
[02:54:16.637 --> 02:54:19.739]  Alright, in closing, we are launching a new product here.
[02:54:19.779 --> 02:54:20.560]  I'm very excited about it.
[02:54:20.580 --> 02:54:24.263]  I should have spent a lot of time on it today, but too busy covering news and having guests on.
[02:54:24.903 --> 02:54:36.452]  I did research on Grundig, on Sanjian, on others, and I found for the price, and not just price, I'd pay more for this, that Kato is the best radio out there.
[02:54:36.912 --> 02:54:40.775]  And we are carrying it, and we have it lower than people right here in town are selling it for.
[02:54:41.697 --> 02:54:45.498]  We have the KA-103, top of the line, $109.
[02:54:45.558 --> 02:54:48.780]  This thing's like $140 in stores.
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:50.280]  Other people sell it online for $119.
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:51.721]  This is $109.
[02:54:52.121 --> 02:54:54.702]  Okay, we are discounting it.
[02:54:54.742 --> 02:54:55.822]  They are all discounted.
[02:54:56.282 --> 02:55:01.224]  We offer a bunch of digital tuners, and we have a crank tuner that we found to be superior.
[02:55:01.264 --> 02:55:02.704]  We just found they're the best out there.
[02:55:03.145 --> 02:55:07.466]  It's available via the safe, secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:07.766 --> 02:55:08.686]  This is a great gift.
[02:55:08.746 --> 02:55:10.067]  It has AM, FM,

[02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:26.851]  I just can't go on.
[02:55:27.451 --> 02:55:29.072]  It's got three kinds of backlight mode.
[02:55:29.833 --> 02:55:31.914]  We've got a bunch of new shortwave radios we're offering.
[02:55:32.914 --> 02:55:37.716]  For years I've wanted to carry them, but I was trying to see what the best deal was for everybody, what the best radios were.
[02:55:38.156 --> 02:55:39.196]  You've requested them.
[02:55:39.737 --> 02:55:43.698]  We got them at InfoWars.com right now.
