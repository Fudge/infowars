[00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:06.314]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:08.055]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:09.856]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:11.337]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:12.978]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:17.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:21.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:30.608]  At least twice a month, Paul Joseph Watson joins us from the United Kingdom
[00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:43.522]  He's our editor and webmaster over at PrisonPlanet.com, teamed up with his brother, Steve Watson, who does InfoWars.net and also works on PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:54.006]  Paul Watson, to cover just a whole spectrum of important issues, will be joining us coming up in the second and into the third hour.
[00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:56.907]  We'll also have wide open phones today.
[00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:06.840]  We've all seen the video over the weekend and being played yesterday and today of the British troops beating up the Iraqi youths.
[00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.523]  And the individual videotaping it is going, Get em!
[00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:10.983]  Yeah!
[00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:11.764]  Alright!
[00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:12.605]  You take that!
[00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:13.025]  Yeah!
[00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:13.386]  Yeah!
[00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:13.786]  Yeah!
[00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:16.709]  And it just all looks like a PSYOP.
[00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:38.665]  Right as the Mohammed cartoon situation is starting to die down a little bit from its all-time high of last week with the rioting and burning all over the world, now this pops out right on time, released by the British government, and you have this videotape of the Muslim youth being beaten up, and that's pure P2OG.
[00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:47.969]  The Pentagon plan to actually go out and stir up the Arabs, stir up the hornets nest, and ooh, then you gotta call an exterminator.
[00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:49.270]  Who you gonna call?
[00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.851]  The N.W.O.
[00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:54.334]  And the Cheney situation is starting to deepen.
[00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:57.997]  The shooting accident of
[00:01:59.282 --> 00:02:02.965]  Last Saturday that we didn't hear about until now.
[00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:04.867]  Now they're saying 22 hours later.
[00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:07.529]  It was 18 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours.
[00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:19.159]  Now, Texas Parks and Wildlife and others from the time that they were told about all this, we're now hearing that it's 22 hours to the time that it was finally released to the national media.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.263]  And Dick Cheney took personal control
[00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:35.658]  Of the police, of the local constabulary, the Secret Service wouldn't let the sheriff talk to Lord Cheney, saying that it was a security precaution.
[00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:39.061]  Yes, you really can't trust those evil sheriffs, everyone knows it.
[00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:49.671]  Especially in South Texas, and so Cheney's getting in a lot of trouble now in the press because of his response.
[00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:55.706]  Showing us that Cheney thinks that he is above the law.
[00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.748]  So we'll get into that coming up.
[00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.471]  Questions are persisting over Cheney shooting.
[00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:12.898]  And then I want to get into Google, Yahoo, all the big search engines and web community platforms, MySpace, all of it.
[00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.833]  Engaging in surveillance, engaging in censorship, engaging in Big Brother type activities.
[00:03:21.293 --> 00:03:25.955]  Now exiled Tibetans protest Google censorship.
[00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:32.178]  And Texas Sheriff, again I mentioned that earlier, but here's the article itself.
[00:03:32.198 --> 00:03:35.720]  Texas Sheriff Bard from interviewing Cheney about shooting incident.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.660]  We'll get more into that.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.862]  And an NBC reporter to the White House spokesman, don't be a jerk.
[00:03:42.017 --> 00:03:44.940]  So we have them now getting into arguments with each other.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.064]  A Florida man is charged in sex slave trade.
[00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:55.569]  This out of News 6, out of Fort Myers, Florida.
[00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.954]  Good, I'm glad that he's gotten in trouble for having these sex slaves.
[00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:10.161]  The problem is, is that meanwhile, Dyncor and Halliburton do it right out in the open and don't get in any trouble, and we've released a big report today
[00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.181]  About last week's interview with Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.
[00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:18.563]  Congresswoman says America run by criminal syndicate.
[00:04:19.424 --> 00:04:22.045]  And we'll get into her report.
[00:04:22.565 --> 00:04:26.127]  American citizens can be put in forced labor camps.
[00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:32.511]  We'll condense that hour-long interview into just a few minutes and read this article in its entirety that Paul Watson
[00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:35.644]  And myself put together.
[00:04:36.184 --> 00:04:37.365]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:38.767]  A lot of news on Iran.
[00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.169]  Just since yesterday when we covered it.
[00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:42.209]  Now breaking.
[00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.031]  So we'll get into that as well.
[00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:46.433]  And wide open phones.
[00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.756]  We'll take a lot of your phone calls early in the shower.
[00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.077]  We took a lot of calls yesterday.
[00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:52.498]  We'll do it again today.
[00:04:52.518 --> 00:04:52.578]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:52.718]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:53.119]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:05.340]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.162]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:12.185]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:19.291]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:21.572]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.772 --> 00:05:24.593]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:29.374]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:33.976]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:37.617]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:41.421]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:10.663]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:17.426]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:17.967]  Yes, sir.
[00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.471]  M-T-B-E.
[00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:34.991]  Radon 222.
[00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:37.573]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:42.836]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.550]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.411]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:21.613]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.

[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.700]  I think so.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:07.603]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:22.032]  If you're tuning in for the first time, this broadcast is a little different from what you've heard in the past.
[00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:26.455]  It isn't about the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.
[00:08:26.515 --> 00:08:27.135]  It isn't about
[00:08:28.234 --> 00:08:33.118]  Which politician wears the fanciest suit or has the most memorable time?
[00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:43.265]  It's about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, it's about Americana, it's about defending this country from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:46.588]  It's about knowing what's really going on in the world.
[00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:52.172]  Knowing who the power players are and what their stated goals are.
[00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:54.854]  And let me tell you what those stated public goals are.
[00:08:56.081 --> 00:08:57.262]  We are to be slaves.
[00:08:57.342 --> 00:08:59.243]  We are to be put into third world status.
[00:08:59.543 --> 00:09:06.847]  We are to be micromanaged, enforced drugged, and live in the communist Chinese model of a one-child policy.
[00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:08.508]  It ain't pretty!
[00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:20.375]  The good news is, humans have fought back against tyranny before, and we always win, because tyranny is its own biggest enemy.
[00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:22.756]  It always self-destructs.
[00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:29.096]  And no amount of think tanks, no amount of propaganda, no amount of garbage is going to save them.
[00:09:30.296 --> 00:09:42.222]  There's an Associated Press article that's up on Infowars.com about the Bush administration spending, it's here in my stack, what does it say?
[00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:43.403]  1.6 billion dollars.
[00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:56.663]  1.6 billion dollars in the last five years on what it calls PR.
[00:09:57.403 --> 00:09:59.464]  We call it propaganda.
[00:10:00.924 --> 00:10:04.025]  Now, 1.6 billion.
[00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:12.727]  We're not talking about billions of dollars in campaign money for campaign ads.
[00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:16.248]  No, we mean covert propaganda.
[00:10:16.923 --> 00:10:18.044]  And it is covert.
[00:10:18.144 --> 00:10:21.567]  It is being paid out all over the place.
[00:10:22.728 --> 00:10:30.974]  And so when you wonder why you see a hundred newscasts in a row saying Arnold Schwarzenegger could and should be president, you know it's bought and paid for.
[00:10:30.994 --> 00:10:32.416]  That news is bought and paid for.
[00:10:32.756 --> 00:10:42.684]  When you see local newscasts telling you how great it'll be to have transponders in your inspection stickers and turn the roads into toll roads, you can bet it was paid for, boys and girls.
[00:10:43.283 --> 00:10:56.867]  When you hear all sorts of newscasts and TV pieces about how great the new Freedom Initiative will be for forced psychological testing and drugging, or how wonderful CPS is grabbing children, you can bet it was paid for!
[00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:00.989]  It's called propaganda placement, not product placement.
[00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:07.571]  In fact, in the last, I've got the numbers here in the stack, in the last five years, I went ahead and looked them up,
[00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:13.066]  Product placement was only a fraction of that.
[00:11:14.226 --> 00:11:18.267]  A fraction of the billion-plus dollars that the Bush administration has spent.
[00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:24.609]  I mean, we thought it was bad when Bill Clinton was spending hundreds of millions for fake newscasts and propaganda.
[00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:30.811]  I screamed bloody murder, ran around freaking out on air, and now it's dwarfed by it.
[00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:32.371]  So we have that report here.
[00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:33.792]  Also,
[00:11:34.913 --> 00:11:44.983]  Some different watchdog groups have put out reports off of federal documents that were just released that the United Arab Emirates was about to buy six U.S.
[00:11:45.023 --> 00:11:50.849]  government ports, and there was some question over the validity of that.
[00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:57.416]  Well, now the World Tribune and several other publications have picked it up, and it's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:11:57.476 --> 00:11:58.657]  Also saw it on Drugs Report.
[00:11:59.384 --> 00:12:06.227]  Last night, and it's also on Drudge, if you want to look at it somewhere else for some reason, the APA report about the billion plus bucks for propaganda.
[00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:11.930]  And notice all of this is just being calmly reported right out in front of everyone.
[00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.691]  You see, we're now in receivership.
[00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:27.937]  And in my first documentary, America Destroyed by Design, I drove around the United States on a 14-day whirlwind tour
[00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:52.078]  That took me from Texas through New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington up into the tip of Canada there and British Columbia, right through Idaho and right through Wyoming and all of those states through the Dakotas down back into Oklahoma.
[00:12:53.109 --> 00:12:55.711]  Well, through Colorado and Oklahoma and back to Texas.
[00:12:55.991 --> 00:13:07.120]  And I just stopped everywhere where the land had been handed over to the UN, where the national parks and the huge buffer zones around them, including private property, had been handed over to UN regulatory control.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:15.826]  I went to the World Heritage sites where famous scenes of battles and American heritage had been handed over to the United Nations.
[00:13:15.906 --> 00:13:21.731]  I went to ports, our only major deepwater port on the West Coast.
[00:13:22.942 --> 00:13:28.387]  Long Beach, a humongous complex, just absolutely huge.
[00:13:29.988 --> 00:13:34.211]  Just hand it over, just give them to the Communist Chinese.
[00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:43.759]  It's not enough that they produce all the goods and ship them in at slave wages to produce them to de-industrialize our country as part of an admitted globalist mercantile plan.
[00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.371]  If you don't know what mercantilism is, look it up.
[00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:48.252]  Look up feudalism.
[00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:51.318]  You'll recognize exactly what we're going under right now.
[00:13:51.338 --> 00:13:52.580]  It's all by design.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.842]  It's crony capitalism.
[00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:55.706]  It's monopoly capitalism.
[00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:57.249]  It's oligopoly capitalism.
[00:13:57.867 --> 00:13:59.288]  It's exactly what we're facing.
[00:13:59.348 --> 00:14:08.611]  See, oligopolies are cartels price-fixing together, inventing upon the people the same thing as a monopoly.
[00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:10.992]  It's called a crime syndicate.
[00:14:11.032 --> 00:14:15.554]  Excuse me, I'm digressing, but everything we deal with is organized crime.
[00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:26.887]  They may wear fancy crowns, and have big long robes, and have their little garden, little red outfits, the bee feeders, surrounding them, telling us how great they are.
[00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:29.729]  But at the end of the day, they're just a gang, folks.
[00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:30.910]  A hereditary gang.
[00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.194]  Telling us we gotta kneel down to the king ape and, you know, kiss his, kiss his, kiss his toe.
[00:14:36.634 --> 00:14:37.575]  And I'm not gonna do it.
[00:14:41.598 --> 00:14:43.460]  And so, we look at the Panama Canal.
[00:14:44.503 --> 00:14:46.805]  Jimmy Carter starts the ball rolling to hand it over.
[00:14:49.066 --> 00:15:09.259]  People freak out, but in every case in 1978, in 1985, in 1999, in 2000 with the handover, everyone's screaming bloody murder, neocons are writing books about it, and writing articles, and Bill Gertz is talking about it, but then you have to go into the documents themselves to find out it was actually a Republican plan
[00:15:10.151 --> 00:15:12.614]  That was pushed and brought to Carter that he executed.
[00:15:12.634 --> 00:15:19.902]  Then you learn that it was Republicans who actually helped ram it through the House and Senate in 1999 who gave it to him.
[00:15:21.063 --> 00:15:25.748]  Did you know the Chinese weren't even the biggest bidders for the 99-year lease?
[00:15:25.788 --> 00:15:26.909]  Something we built?
[00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:28.191]  Something the French couldn't build?
[00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:31.134]  Did you know it was just given to them?
[00:15:33.007 --> 00:15:33.408]  That's right.
[00:15:33.488 --> 00:15:35.673]  Oh no, we're not going to give it to people who are bidding more.
[00:15:36.474 --> 00:15:36.975]  What were there?
[00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:40.904]  Over five American companies, French companies, and they built half of it.
[00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:44.130]  British companies, German companies.
[00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:46.199]  No, you can't have it.
[00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:50.120]  Japanese companies, Dutch companies, no, you can't have it.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.861]  No, because you've been our friends in the past.
[00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:55.862]  Because, no, we have to give it to China.
[00:15:55.922 --> 00:15:56.242]  Why?
[00:15:56.282 --> 00:16:04.386]  Because there's been a strategic deal cut back in the early 1970s, and the Chinese have bragged about it, and baby, they're going to be giving everything.
[00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:07.767]  And I don't mean they're slave people, they're poor, hard-working people.
[00:16:08.227 --> 00:16:09.248]  I mean, they're masters.
[00:16:09.428 --> 00:16:15.392]  The new order sees that beehive over there with a billion, 300 million slaves, and baby, they're going to be giving everything.
[00:16:15.612 --> 00:16:19.594]  And you're going to have everything you've got taken away from you, and I hope you realize that.
[00:16:19.835 --> 00:16:21.436]  The war has been declared against us.
[00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:24.477]  So you're worried about United Arab Emirates being given six ports.
[00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:26.379]  You've got to love it.
[00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:28.840]  The government controls some of these ports, owns them.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.041]  Some of the others are private.
[00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.543]  They want to buy them for six plus billion dollars.
[00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:33.683]  That's about a billion a port.
[00:16:34.984 --> 00:16:35.484]  What is it?
[00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:35.665]  6.3 billion?
[00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.508]  And there's just no discussion of it.
[00:16:41.348 --> 00:16:42.169]  Secret U.S.
[00:16:42.229 --> 00:16:44.610]  Board, one of these secret trade boards, just agrees.
[00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.572]  And believe me, six million bucks for those ports is a pittance.
[00:16:51.873 --> 00:16:56.475]  So we pay for them with tax money to build them, and then they're handed over to private interest.
[00:16:58.295 --> 00:17:00.276]  And that's what privatization is.
[00:17:00.556 --> 00:17:01.757]  It is not free market.
[00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:06.839]  It's just simply they're getting rid of the mantle, even the facade, even the front,
[00:17:07.717 --> 00:17:14.519]  Even the thin veneer of it being the government, and they're just giving it to their buddies, and don't worry, they'll have governmental power over you.
[00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:20.460]  It's like the King of Spain is one of the big stockholders, the majority stockholder, and what is it, Centra?
[00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:26.642]  And they're being given the major roads in Indiana, they're moving ahead with the roads here in Texas, existing roads.
[00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:27.442]  Thank you!
[00:17:27.502 --> 00:17:28.142]  That's ours!
[00:17:28.202 --> 00:17:28.762]  Thank you!
[00:17:30.463 --> 00:17:35.164]  We're going into receivership, because do you know who owns the stock in the central banks?
[00:17:35.928 --> 00:17:43.473]  The Sachs-Coburg-Gothas, Juan Carlos, King of Spain, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.855]  Openly, they own the stock in the World Central Banks.
[00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:47.176]  They print the money out of nothing.
[00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:52.139]  We go into debt to them for nothing just because they control the Congress and we sign deals with them.
[00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:59.044]  And when there isn't anything left, ladies and gentlemen, why do you think the Supreme Court said you don't own your private property if private interests won it?
[00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.105]  That's feudalism!
[00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:08.429]  If the local pimp, who's in with the viceroy, who's in with the emperor, wants your land, baby, it's gone.
[00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:13.511]  And by the way, in New London, Connecticut, they didn't pay people even just compensation.
[00:18:13.691 --> 00:18:15.572]  They didn't even pay them tax value.
[00:18:15.732 --> 00:18:24.456]  You got a $300,000 valued house, we're gonna condemn it, and we're gonna give you $61,000 for the lot, and if you don't like it, you ain't gonna get nothin'!
[00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:34.629]  And if you sue us and fight us, when we win in our kangaroo court, we're going to charge you back rent for a five-year fight, and you're going to owe us money on top of us taking your lot.
[00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:36.630]  How do you like that?
[00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.512]  And 99% of Americans in a Lou Dobbs poll were against it, but they just knew they were taking people's land.
[00:18:43.552 --> 00:18:45.352]  They didn't know they weren't even getting paid.
[00:18:45.372 --> 00:18:48.593]  We're actually getting charged a bill.
[00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:50.494]  You argued with the king.
[00:18:50.534 --> 00:18:51.774]  You brought the king into court.
[00:18:52.195 --> 00:18:53.195]  Yeah, you're going to pay.
[00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.375]  So you just get ready for it and I hope you all enjoy it.
[00:18:59.657 --> 00:19:01.339]  Enjoy your ball games.
[00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:02.601]  Enjoy it all.
[00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.924]  Just don't care about the country or your children.
[00:19:05.264 --> 00:19:12.454]  Run around and just suck your thumb and hang baubles all around your necks and run around with your trinkets and pose for everybody.
[00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:27.349]  But let me tell you, the reckoning is coming, and I'm talking to those out there who don't care, the giggling, simpering, just mindless masses who love slavery, who love lies and love change.
[00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:33.151]  For all the wonderful listeners and the people that care and know what's going on, God bless you for being involved.
[00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.572]  And we are going to stop a lot of this.
[00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:43.915]  As we go into receivership more and more, and as the vice grips tighten, more and more people are going to be flipping over to our point of view.
[00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:46.761]  And we're going to take this country back, believe me.
[00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:54.270]  When our bacon goes into the fire, which it's already starting to go into the fire, that's why so many people are waking up, our numbers are going to explode.
[00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.676]  That's why the government's trying to ban free speech and getting their riot police together.
[00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.198]  We'll just sweep them aside, though.
[00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:12.554]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[00:23:49.993 --> 00:23:51.754]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.364 --> 00:24:16.705]  And listen, if I sound nasty and angry, I am!
[00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:29.448]  You know, the majority of the billions and billions spent every year in lobbying, two full-time lobbyists for every member of Congress.
[00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.809]  Think about that.
[00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.232]  And the majority of them are foreign.
[00:24:36.373 --> 00:24:48.506]  Foreign interests come right in with billions and billions of dollars and openly pay off the federal government and there's even more lobbyists at the state level and many of them are foreigners.
[00:24:49.654 --> 00:25:12.701]  head lobbyist for the country of Mexico in the state of Texas after lobbying successfully for the last four years is now the head of Texas-Mexico relations for the governor of Texas and he still holds the position of lobbyist of employee of the country of Mexico.
[00:25:12.821 --> 00:25:13.661]  Imagine that!
[00:25:14.182 --> 00:25:17.863]  You are a foreign agent and you openly sit
[00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:26.176]  In the most powerful position in the governor's office dealing with the border and trade issues with Mexico.
[00:25:28.257 --> 00:25:35.342]  And we have the articles right here in front of me with the six ports being given to the United Arab Emirates.
[00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:38.007]  And that's what lobbying does.
[00:25:38.327 --> 00:25:49.530]  They then go through the regulations and these federal boards, in most cases, will only sell the companies or the government holdings or the government land to these foreign entities.
[00:25:49.950 --> 00:26:00.812]  And another reason for that is with the dollar devalued by over 40% in the last five years, over 40%, now their currencies can buy more here.
[00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:08.515]  Bush PR cost taxpayers 1.6 billion dollars.
[00:26:08.635 --> 00:26:12.978]  There's actually an AP article and another one here out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:15.901]  The Bush administration spent at least
[00:26:16.987 --> 00:26:26.032]  1.6 billion on public relations propaganda and advertising campaigns over 30 months.
[00:26:26.632 --> 00:26:30.875]  I'm sorry, I read this this morning and was going from memory and I said in the last five years.
[00:26:31.035 --> 00:26:32.175]  That's another article over here.
[00:26:32.436 --> 00:26:35.937]  I'm sorry, it's just in the last two and a half years, excuse me.
[00:26:37.418 --> 00:26:39.439]  According to, so it's much worse, I'm sorry.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.903]  According to a report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
[00:26:46.818 --> 00:27:07.311]  The report requested by Congressional Democrats shows the government agencies are relying on outside consultants to help pitch their message to the public, whether it's to bolster public support for the Iraq war, propaganda, deter buying prescription drugs from Canada, or recruit for the armed forces.
[00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:11.614]  To communicate these messages to the general public or particular target audiences.
[00:27:12.074 --> 00:27:16.197]  Departments contract with media related vendors for a wide range of services.
[00:27:16.638 --> 00:27:19.440]  And also that represents a payoff to a lot of these media outlets.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:25.464]  Sometimes they'll pay double what the going rate is and that's really a above board payoff.
[00:27:26.525 --> 00:27:28.967]  So it's just unbelievable.
[00:27:28.987 --> 00:27:33.910]  And then remember a few years ago when Bush spent two hundred and forty plus million dollars.
[00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.250]  What was it?
[00:27:35.907 --> 00:27:43.031]  It was $255 million on the prescription drug program and they had hundreds of fake newscasts that they paid for.
[00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:49.015]  Local news channels would air them and people would see these well-produced newscasts and just think it was some new news channel.
[00:27:49.055 --> 00:27:51.616]  Never said it's the government, never said it's propaganda.
[00:27:51.816 --> 00:27:58.000]  They would cut in speeches of Bush with crowds that weren't even there for him, clapping for him from other speeches.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.543]  They would just dub it in and cut to people clapping and standing up for him when it wasn't even real!
[00:28:05.811 --> 00:28:12.577]  Now, I mean, even if you love George Bush and love all the stuff he's doing and think he's a wonderful conservative, it should scare the daylights out of you.
[00:28:12.597 --> 00:28:14.139]  This is totally un-American.
[00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:17.842]  This is propaganda land, but not just the propaganda value.
[00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:24.628]  There's the payoff value of $1.6 billion in the last two and a half years, and we know what was going on before that.
[00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:27.611]  Now it's just expanding and accelerating and getting worse.
[00:28:28.391 --> 00:28:31.134]  That's a payoff to the media by the government.
[00:28:34.018 --> 00:28:55.626]  And it goes on here, the GAO report did not single out any project for special attention, but in a separate study a year ago, the agency said the Bush administration had illegally, they're still doing it, because he says he's above the law, engaged illegally in a covert propaganda, this is the GAO, for paying conservative commentator Armstrong Williams to praise No Child Left Behind Act 2002.
[00:28:57.808 --> 00:29:00.653]  In the education law, in newspaper columns, and on television.
[00:29:00.673 --> 00:29:01.935]  He didn't tell anyone he was on the payroll.
[00:29:02.216 --> 00:29:06.103]  The Bush administration was also wrapped on the knuckles for issuing
[00:29:07.034 --> 00:29:15.879]  Pre-packaged video news releases that counted administration initiatives to broadcast media outlets, some of which were aired the programs without disclosing their source.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.161]  That was the $255 million.
[00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:19.762]  I don't know why I always say $245.
[00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:30.228]  Government auditors studied the spending by seven different cabinet-level departments for 30 months, covering all of fiscal year 2003-2004 and the first half of 2005.
[00:29:30.488 --> 00:29:36.552]  They focused on government agency contracts with public relations firms and advertising agencies and media organizations.
[00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:45.159]  Anyone with a GAO said would create or distribute content through various outlets such as radio, television, and newspapers.
[00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:49.542]  We'll come back, take your calls, get into a bunch of other news, new Cheney developments.
[00:29:51.824 --> 00:29:52.724]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:54.826]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:58.429]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:05.833]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[00:30:06.033 --> 00:30:07.836]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[00:30:07.996 --> 00:30:12.022]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[00:30:12.222 --> 00:30:13.605]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[00:30:14.005 --> 00:30:18.592]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[00:30:18.832 --> 00:30:24.636]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[00:30:24.816 --> 00:30:36.284]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[00:30:36.564 --> 00:30:46.071]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days, to an improvement in overall health.
[00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:51.776]  Not available in stores, STEM Enhance is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Markaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:52.017]  That's 860-567-7744.
[00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:03.334]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.454 --> 00:31:07.596]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.696 --> 00:31:10.578]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.658 --> 00:31:17.341]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:17.801]  Yes, sir.
[00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:34.389]  M-T-B-E.
[00:31:34.609 --> 00:31:35.049]  Radon 222.
[00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.492]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:31:37.652 --> 00:31:42.756]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[00:31:42.916 --> 00:31:50.683]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:50.703 --> 00:31:51.143]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:51.203 --> 00:31:52.884]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:01.215 --> 00:32:02.697]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:32:03.037 --> 00:32:06.982]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:32:07.363 --> 00:32:10.887]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:32:11.268 --> 00:32:14.832]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[00:32:15.213 --> 00:32:20.079]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:26.201]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:30.202]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[00:32:30.562 --> 00:32:32.643]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:32:32.983 --> 00:32:38.745]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:32:39.165 --> 00:32:40.346]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:32:40.686 --> 00:32:41.786]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:32:41.886 --> 00:32:47.309]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found at TriVortex.com.
[00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:50.971]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:32:51.251 --> 00:32:52.552]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:32:52.592 --> 00:32:52.872]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:33:03.038 --> 00:33:09.622]  No, I can't do it anywhere near as good as Mel Blanc, the voice of Elmer Fudd.
[00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:28.110]  But come on!
[00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:37.217]  We now have the official Texas Parks and Wildlife incident report and it's exactly what Cheney said happened, whether that's true or not.
[00:33:37.237 --> 00:33:39.779]  We know they're just echoing what the witnesses say they saw.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:52.650]  The bird flew out of the bush and flew over Cheney and he just simply followed it and did a 180 and shot right behind him and shot the wealthy
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:34:00.183]  Austin lawyer in the face and chest with his 28-gauge sissy shotgun.
[00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:03.144]  So that's what happened in South Texas.
[00:34:03.184 --> 00:34:11.628]  Now the rest of the story is the fact that they wouldn't let the sheriff for almost a day interview Dick Cheney.
[00:34:11.688 --> 00:34:16.090]  Dick Cheney told the locals not to talk about it and they followed orders.
[00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.230]  The local police did.
[00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:20.812]  And this is Scott McClellan admitting that he told everyone what to do.
[00:34:21.371 --> 00:34:23.512]  McClellan's saying, hey, I'm not running the PR on this.
[00:34:23.913 --> 00:34:25.334]  The Vice President is.
[00:34:25.934 --> 00:34:35.500]  And then he decided to call a local newspaper, because they could easily be managed, friends with the local landowner, to then release the story the way he wanted it spun to control it.
[00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:38.202]  And all of this for 22 hours now.
[00:34:38.222 --> 00:34:39.303]  That's the official number.
[00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.784]  Not 18, not 20, not 21.
[00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:43.566]  22 hours until the American people learned.
[00:34:44.066 --> 00:34:50.110]  And Cheney, it's now admitted, told the Secret Service not even to tell Bush for about four hours.
[00:34:50.777 --> 00:34:52.398]  Just, uh, no, don't tell anybody.
[00:34:52.478 --> 00:34:53.058]  I'm the boss.
[00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:54.199]  I'm in control.
[00:34:54.279 --> 00:34:55.500]  I've just shot someone.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.321]  Don't, uh, Secret Service, don't let the police talk to me.
[00:34:58.702 --> 00:34:59.702]  Don't let the press know.
[00:34:59.802 --> 00:35:02.444]  National Security, yes sir, we'll do that.
[00:35:04.165 --> 00:35:08.487]  And according to Bush, they're all above the law, so they can, uh, do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:35:08.507 --> 00:35:18.093]  I mean, I wonder if Cheney gets pulled over drunk driving, well, or if Bush gets pulled over again drunk driving, will they just say, Officers, National Security, I'm fighting Al Qaeda with this bottle of Jack Daniels.
[00:35:20.609 --> 00:35:23.191]  So it really shows the double standard in the way they're operating.
[00:35:23.211 --> 00:35:24.232]  But I'm about to go to your calls.
[00:35:24.312 --> 00:35:31.157]  Back to this $1.6 billion spent just in the last two and a half years.
[00:35:32.358 --> 00:35:35.801]  And this is what we know about on fake newscasts and propaganda.
[00:35:37.582 --> 00:35:41.125]  The GAO office, Governmental Accounting Office,
[00:35:42.503 --> 00:35:42.843]  I think?
[00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:01.700]  Propaganda piece.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.681]  We don't have to tell you.
[00:36:02.781 --> 00:36:04.682]  We can pay for fake news articles.
[00:36:05.042 --> 00:36:19.254]  And somehow the media all decided, because most of them are on the payroll, most major newspapers and TV stations, that we'll just focus in on Armstrong Williams when there are thousands of individuals on the payroll and hundreds of newspapers and TV stations and networks on the payroll.
[00:36:20.951 --> 00:36:22.011]  And it works real simple.
[00:36:22.432 --> 00:36:26.033]  Again, you'll see an article in a local paper pushing toll roads and saying how great it is.
[00:36:26.073 --> 00:36:29.854]  You wonder, well, 90 plus percent of people are against these toll roads in Texas.
[00:36:30.214 --> 00:36:31.375]  Why is the paper for it?
[00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:36.276]  And then you learn that the very companies are in there buying full-page ads.
[00:36:37.657 --> 00:36:39.157]  I mean, this is how it works.
[00:36:39.338 --> 00:36:43.719]  I mean, you start handing around billions of dollars, and that's just federally.
[00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:45.540]  It's happening locally.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.901]  So many times I hear local radio, and I know
[00:36:49.753 --> 00:36:51.213]  That it's a propaganda placement.
[00:36:51.634 --> 00:36:56.755]  I know that in the local radio newscast, I've just heard propaganda, and I know somebody paid for it.
[00:36:56.995 --> 00:37:01.276]  I've even called BoardOps before at a local radio station and said, Hey, this is Alex Jones, how you doing?
[00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:02.476]  BoardOps, yeah, yeah, I know who you are.
[00:37:02.796 --> 00:37:05.017]  Hey, is that in your traffic report there?
[00:37:06.017 --> 00:37:15.280]  Was that just an ad back there in the news, say, for the Austin, quote, Air Force, which is a group that propagandized for emission testing, really just a taxation grid?
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.480]  But I didn't say that, I said,
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.301]  Was that just an ad during the news?
[00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.302]  He said, yeah, uh-huh.
[00:37:19.702 --> 00:37:20.022]  Why?
[00:37:20.042 --> 00:37:21.904]  Because, you know, they don't know.
[00:37:22.244 --> 00:37:23.805]  They're just telling me something's an ad.
[00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:25.046]  And I go, oh, thank you.
[00:37:25.486 --> 00:37:27.668]  Thank you for that information.
[00:37:28.228 --> 00:37:31.771]  And then I go out on the street where they're having a little Austin Air Force propaganda powwow.
[00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:32.611]  This is years ago.
[00:37:32.631 --> 00:37:34.913]  When I first became aware of this, about six years ago.
[00:37:34.973 --> 00:37:36.254]  Now they got their emissions testing.
[00:37:36.834 --> 00:37:38.475]  And I go down and talk to the head of the Austin Air Force.
[00:37:38.495 --> 00:37:42.058]  And I go, are you guys buying news on the local radio?
[00:37:42.598 --> 00:37:44.620]  Are you buying ad packages and then it's put in as news?
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.401]  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, mm-hmm, sure.
[00:37:47.128 --> 00:37:49.832]  See, and that's only one little example.
[00:37:50.693 --> 00:37:54.498]  So when you see these big advertisement agencies out there, these big ad agencies...
[00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:58.750]  And you wonder why it's always anti-gun, always anti-family.
[00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.690]  Why ads that are for the most innocuous of things.
[00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:06.732]  It could be an ad for a car, or an ad for a theme park, or an ad for anything.
[00:38:07.032 --> 00:38:15.013]  There's always some anti-family, anti-gun, pro-police, pro-New World Order, pro-police state propaganda in it.
[00:38:15.513 --> 00:38:17.574]  Because they're just fellow travelers, folks.
[00:38:17.594 --> 00:38:19.214]  They're all in bed together.
[00:38:19.274 --> 00:38:22.015]  It's a mafia feeding on us.
[00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.711]  And it's a big joke to them.
[00:38:25.131 --> 00:38:33.297]  You see, the foreign money comes in and openly pays off your politicians, and then they openly instruct the bureaucracies to go propagandize you.
[00:38:34.077 --> 00:38:36.659]  So the lobbyists for pennies get huge returns.
[00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:41.122]  It was like that California congressman who just pled guilty to stealing $800 million.
[00:38:41.702 --> 00:38:46.465]  He stole $800 million and had it mailed to a fake P.O.
[00:38:46.485 --> 00:38:47.926]  box of a fake company.
[00:38:48.947 --> 00:38:49.487]  But guess what?
[00:38:49.847 --> 00:38:52.389]  For doing that, he only got $2 million from the company.
[00:38:53.695 --> 00:38:54.496]  All he had was a P.O.
[00:38:54.536 --> 00:38:55.616]  box and a fake website.
[00:38:56.357 --> 00:39:01.019]  All he got was two million, I'm sure there's more in his bank accounts, but he got a pittance.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:02.841]  He got a pittance.
[00:39:02.881 --> 00:39:09.084]  He got paid off two million dollars and they got a payoff of eight hundred, now plus million we're learning.
[00:39:09.124 --> 00:39:10.425]  He's pled guilty to eight hundred million.
[00:39:12.026 --> 00:39:13.207]  And this is the way it goes.
[00:39:13.247 --> 00:39:14.307]  This is the way it operates.
[00:39:14.327 --> 00:39:15.188]  This is how it happens.
[00:39:15.608 --> 00:39:16.949]  We found corruption.
[00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:23.273]  I discovered corruption over a year ago in the local Axis TV station and it's now admitted in the paper, quote, producers reported it.
[00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:30.981]  And we had to record the board members and we had to sneak around like spies just to try to save free speech here in this town.
[00:39:31.382 --> 00:39:37.787]  We had to bring it to the city auditor and then bring it to the district attorney and say, you better do something.
[00:39:37.807 --> 00:39:39.669]  We have them admitting it on tape, they're doing it.
[00:39:41.408 --> 00:39:44.411]  And then somebody robbed the storage facility and stole the documents.
[00:39:44.431 --> 00:39:46.532]  It was like a movie, you know, a sleuth movie.
[00:39:46.993 --> 00:39:53.818]  And finally they grabbed one of them for $350-something thousand dollars that he stole and he's put guilty to it.
[00:39:54.979 --> 00:40:00.203]  And we know the names of the other people and they're caught absolutely red-handed and nothing's happening to them!
[00:40:02.005 --> 00:40:03.546]  And see, that's just a microcosm.
[00:40:05.365 --> 00:40:16.255]  We had to hire PIs, and we had to sue them, and we had to get depositions, and I had to spend just hundreds of hours on it, just to ferret out that one little nugget of corruption.
[00:40:16.295 --> 00:40:19.859]  Because I came nose up to corruption, right up against it.
[00:40:19.879 --> 00:40:22.702]  Of course, the money grabbers were also trying to shut down free speech.
[00:40:23.663 --> 00:40:26.345]  And so I said, you know, by hook or crook, I'm going to beat you.
[00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:29.188]  And I said, I know you're doing something bad.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.722]  I said, I can smell it, and I stuck my big snout in the middle of it.
[00:40:35.823 --> 00:40:38.164]  But again, we're facing a mountain of corruption.
[00:40:38.364 --> 00:40:42.886]  You can go to any agency, any government group, anything, and you're going to walk right into corruption.
[00:40:42.906 --> 00:40:44.727]  You're going to walk into a nest of criminals.
[00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:49.409]  And sure, the people at the front desk and the folks doing most of the work at the facility, they're not crooks.
[00:40:49.429 --> 00:40:50.310]  They're not getting any money.
[00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.430]  Most cops aren't crooks.
[00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:52.491]  They're not involved in corruption.
[00:40:53.507 --> 00:41:00.158]  But you get to the tops of the organizations, they are as rotten as a dead horse that's been rotten in the gutter for two weeks.
[00:41:00.618 --> 00:41:03.282]  They're covered in literal maggots!
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.320]  And they're telling us how good they are.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.901]  How Al-Qaeda attacked us.
[00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:12.722]  And every week some new document comes out and the White House doesn't even deny it.
[00:41:12.922 --> 00:41:15.983]  How they were planning to stage our planes getting shot down to go to war.
[00:41:16.203 --> 00:41:19.404]  How they were planning to plant WMDs and claim somebody found them.
[00:41:19.424 --> 00:41:21.624]  And how they were planning to do this and do that.
[00:41:21.664 --> 00:41:22.824]  It's ridiculous!
[00:41:22.904 --> 00:41:23.805]  It's ridiculous!
[00:41:25.805 --> 00:41:30.167]  I mean, how many times do we have to catch them engaged in crime, engaged in corruption?
[00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:32.588]  How many times until we stop trusting them?
[00:41:32.748 --> 00:41:34.728]  Until we stop giving them control of our lives?
[00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:35.989]  But they're saying, oh no!
[00:41:36.249 --> 00:41:37.570]  We're militarizing against you!
[00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.610]  We're arming against you!
[00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.491]  Get ready for the end of Posse Comandatus!
[00:41:40.511 --> 00:41:41.571]  Get ready for troops on the streets!
[00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:43.492]  Get ready for martial law when we're attacked again!
[00:41:43.532 --> 00:41:44.412]  It's for your own good!
[00:41:44.732 --> 00:41:49.934]  No, it's for their own good, so they can go on stealing, and steal at even greater levels!
[00:41:51.455 --> 00:41:52.835]  And I don't say this to scare you.
[00:41:52.855 --> 00:41:54.436]  They changed the law three years ago.
[00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.011]  They're already moving ahead doing it.
[00:41:57.071 --> 00:41:58.532]  Many pension funds are failing.
[00:41:59.032 --> 00:42:06.156]  They are openly looting the pension funds of the fire departments, the police departments, the government agencies, the private companies.
[00:42:06.216 --> 00:42:07.177]  It's all happening.
[00:42:07.197 --> 00:42:14.101]  The money's being taken out over the last two and a half years, and they know you're going to get mad about it, so they're gearing up with the police state.
[00:42:14.461 --> 00:42:15.562]  So listen to me, police.
[00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:28.066]  When they take your pension fund, I know you'll still, you'll just whine about it, but you'll still serve the system, and you'll still pull little families over and search their cars on the side of the road looking for drugs that your boss has shipped in to begin with.
[00:42:29.407 --> 00:42:31.488]  So just don't tell me I didn't tell you.
[00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:32.709]  I'm actually your friend.
[00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:33.890]  Okay?
[00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.131]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:42:35.491 --> 00:42:38.554]  I'm sick of being surrounded by dirty criminals!
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:47.043]  You know, one reason there was such expansion in the South and the West is because there was some corruption, but not the systemic corruption of the Old East.
[00:42:47.123 --> 00:42:49.685]  Anytime something gets big and old, corrupt people get control.
[00:42:51.185 --> 00:42:56.968]  And, you know, the mafias and the gangs that would never operate in the South and the West, because people just wouldn't put up with it.
[00:42:57.609 --> 00:42:59.270]  Our forefathers wouldn't put up with it.
[00:42:59.851 --> 00:43:00.611]  Now it's here.
[00:43:00.631 --> 00:43:02.773]  The gang shaking down the shopkeepers.
[00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.914]  The people ordering protection rackets.
[00:43:05.274 --> 00:43:12.740]  Imagine populations where you can just walk in and just demand that because I'll burn your business down or I'll beat you up if you don't pay me.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.941]  In the old days you did that in Texas.
[00:43:14.961 --> 00:43:18.224]  Somebody'd pull a gun out instantly and blow you away right there in their parlor.
[00:43:18.804 --> 00:43:21.546]  Now we've been turned into little cowardly jellyfish too.
[00:43:22.464 --> 00:43:25.669]  I just, it's so sad to see a free people go into slavery.
[00:43:26.009 --> 00:43:27.111]  It makes me sick!
[00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:31.437]  And criminals are such bullying little wimps to begin with!
[00:43:32.439 --> 00:43:34.502]  They need to be knocked upside the head!
[00:43:34.522 --> 00:43:36.164]  They need to have their teeth knocked out!
[00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:38.668]  Literally and figuratively, they need to be stomped on!
[00:43:39.562 --> 00:43:41.402]  They need to be run back into the shadows!
[00:43:41.943 --> 00:43:47.864]  Instead of hiding out in their shacks, out in their hideouts, where criminals should be, they're running things!
[00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:49.684]  And I'm, for one, in sick of it!
[00:43:49.884 --> 00:43:51.745]  And I can see exactly what it is!
[00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:53.705]  And it's time for you to see what it is!
[00:43:53.725 --> 00:43:56.206]  Alright, I said I'd take a lot of calls.
[00:43:56.246 --> 00:43:57.686]  We did it yesterday, we'll do it today.
[00:43:57.706 --> 00:44:01.867]  We've got a bunch of other news coming up, but right now I just get mad, folks.
[00:44:01.907 --> 00:44:02.747]  We should all be mad.
[00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.168]  Kurt in Texas and Rodney, Jim, Dave, Lori and others.
[00:44:06.188 --> 00:44:07.828]  Go ahead Kurt, you're on the air.
[00:44:07.888 --> 00:44:08.348]  Yes sir.
[00:44:08.909 --> 00:44:22.413]  While Jack Blood was handling the show for you last, I was listening and they were having the miners lost in the mines and the head of the mining organization said,
[00:44:26.516 --> 00:44:28.417]  There's no need for them being lost.
[00:44:30.058 --> 00:44:41.765]  We can outfit them with a personal electronic device where they can be found at any time, so I believe they're going to push to microchip all the miners.
[00:44:41.785 --> 00:44:42.565]  Sir, I agree.
[00:44:43.666 --> 00:44:48.549]  I have four articles where companies are making their employees take chips now, not in Mexico, but in the U.S.
[00:44:49.129 --> 00:44:51.130]  Yes, this was in West Virginia.
[00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:52.291]  Yeah, I remember with the miners.
[00:44:54.048 --> 00:44:55.389]  Well, you want a job, don't you?
[00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:56.430]  You don't have to work here.
[00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.192]  If you want to work here and you want to eat, you go and take the chip.
[00:44:59.873 --> 00:45:00.493]  That's real great.
[00:45:00.673 --> 00:45:01.774]  It's for your safety, too.
[00:45:03.055 --> 00:45:04.376]  It's all for your safety, Kurt.
[00:45:04.857 --> 00:45:05.717]  Yes, that's true.
[00:45:06.057 --> 00:45:06.518]  That's true.
[00:45:06.538 --> 00:45:12.843]  I saw that little blurb about we can fit them with a personal identification device and they didn't say whether it was
[00:45:14.225 --> 00:45:22.409]  Yeah, well, I figure that they will get around to the microchip for them, you know.
[00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:26.111]  They're already getting around to it.
[00:45:26.691 --> 00:45:26.931]  Yes.
[00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:28.312]  With other professions.
[00:45:28.872 --> 00:45:33.815]  They'd say, well, down there in the mine, they'd likely lose a watch or something, confusion.
[00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:37.937]  Well, we'll give them a microchip, you know, where it'll stay with them always.
[00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:41.472]  And I hadn't heard a mention of it.
[00:45:41.512 --> 00:45:43.293]  I thought I might just bring it up.
[00:45:43.634 --> 00:45:44.614]  Kurt, I appreciate that.
[00:45:44.654 --> 00:45:50.197]  What do you think of Cheney doing a 180 and shooting somebody in his hunting party that was behind him?
[00:45:50.657 --> 00:45:53.019]  I wonder what the man did to him to deserve that.
[00:45:53.719 --> 00:45:58.642]  It's a very good possibility that he is a big contributor to the campaign.
[00:45:59.162 --> 00:46:00.122]  You know what I just learned?
[00:46:00.142 --> 00:46:02.084]  Maybe he decided he was going to expose something.
[00:46:03.164 --> 00:46:08.287]  Did you know Mr. Whittington owned a big building downtown that burned down a few weeks ago?
[00:46:09.875 --> 00:46:13.877]  And did you know that I just talked to somebody who was living in there, who had an apartment in there?
[00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:15.458]  You weren't supposed to have apartments in there, but they did.
[00:46:15.478 --> 00:46:21.000]  I was talking to them last night, and I'm trying to confirm this, but two separate people now have told me this.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.242]  There was another fire there six days before, and the media has never talked about it.
[00:46:25.642 --> 00:46:26.922]  The firefighters were able to put it out.
[00:46:26.962 --> 00:46:28.023]  Now that's suspicious.
[00:46:28.383 --> 00:46:31.324]  And now, I mean, what's the chances that his building burns down?
[00:46:31.364 --> 00:46:32.505]  There was a fire before that.
[00:46:32.565 --> 00:46:34.145]  Now he's down there getting shot by Cheney.
[00:46:34.405 --> 00:46:35.946]  Look, I don't think it's a conspiracy, though.
[00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:38.367]  I think Cheney is just a complete idiot.
[00:46:39.164 --> 00:46:39.484]  You do.
[00:46:40.045 --> 00:46:41.826]  Very good possibility.
[00:46:41.986 --> 00:46:43.548]  He was going to kill him.
[00:46:43.568 --> 00:46:44.528]  They got people to kill him.
[00:46:44.548 --> 00:46:46.430]  It wouldn't be the Vice President doing it himself.
[00:46:49.753 --> 00:46:55.777]  It might be a political warning to the fellow if they thought he was stepping out of line.
[00:46:57.198 --> 00:47:01.062]  Alright, well listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:47:01.562 --> 00:47:02.663]  It could be this, it could be that.
[00:47:02.703 --> 00:47:03.844]  We just have to go off what we know.
[00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:25.445]  And if they wanted to kill somebody they'd have them have a car wreck or have a heart attack or get mugged or in a carjacking and you know that's how they make it look or they'll even kill you and then you know go bust some mental patient who was just released the day before and have them confess to it that's one of their favorite things to do they wouldn't and supposedly this guy is deep in with Chaney a total minion of him so
[00:47:26.015 --> 00:47:26.575]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:28.436]  I'm just wondering, Alex, why was the Vice President so fearful
[00:47:43.397 --> 00:48:10.735]  uh... uh... you know to uh... delay this uh... story for twenty two what is he so fearful of that he had to delay it for twenty two hours well number one if you shoot somebody with a twenty eight gauge shotgun which i'm guessing has a similar pattern to a four ten at thirty yards okay at thirty yards i mean we're talking that's far away with a shotgun the pattern is too close it doesn't make sense
[00:48:11.295 --> 00:48:22.009]  The pattern, and you can go look at the incident report, it shows where he got hit, it shows the area the police officer or the park official drew it up.
[00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:26.234]  It's a very tight pattern, it looks more like 10 yards to me.
[00:48:26.955 --> 00:48:31.199]  So, I think that, uh, who knows, Cheney could have dropped his gun.
[00:48:31.219 --> 00:48:35.482]  I mean, that's a lot more plausible and reasonable than his made-up story.
[00:48:35.742 --> 00:48:43.829]  It may be true, but I mean, doing a 180 and turning around and shooting behind you to shoot a bird that flies over you, that's a 101 no-no.
[00:48:44.209 --> 00:48:47.552]  And supposedly, Cheney's this big accomplished hunter who constantly is hunting.
[00:48:47.812 --> 00:48:49.073]  That was my next point.
[00:48:49.313 --> 00:48:50.634]  He's a seasoned hunter.
[00:48:50.915 --> 00:48:53.617]  He knows the rules, the safety rules of hunting.
[00:48:54.118 --> 00:48:54.819]  I don't think so.
[00:49:04.564 --> 00:49:15.295]  Well, I don't like to sit here and have theories, but in an investigation we have to try to look at it and balance it around.
[00:49:15.775 --> 00:49:23.563]  It sounds to me like Chaney dropped his gun and it went off and shot the guy from about 20 feet away from the size of the pattern and how bad off he is.
[00:49:24.143 --> 00:49:27.527]  Folks, if you get peppered at 30 yards, even with a 12-gauge birdshot,
[00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:30.889]  If it doesn't hit me in the eye or something, they just pull it out with tweezers.
[00:49:31.149 --> 00:49:32.489]  The guy is still in the hospital.
[00:49:32.529 --> 00:49:33.610]  They won't let anybody see him.
[00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:38.692]  If he didn't look really bad, you would have already seen him all over TV saying everything's great.
[00:49:39.093 --> 00:49:41.734]  I mean, for all we know, that guy could be on life support right now.
[00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:42.454]  We don't know.
[00:49:42.734 --> 00:49:44.115]  These people are such liars.
[00:49:44.135 --> 00:49:45.356]  They lie about everything.
[00:49:45.696 --> 00:49:46.636]  Something stinks.
[00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:49.438]  Holding the cops off for almost a day.
[00:49:49.698 --> 00:49:51.839]  Secret Service declaring national security.
[00:49:51.859 --> 00:49:54.040]  You know, because the sheriff's so dangerous, folks.
[00:49:55.427 --> 00:49:58.369]  Here's something else that I wanted to mention.
[00:49:58.889 --> 00:50:05.293]  At PrisonPlanet.com, I noticed that you pointed out that Bush's approval is down to 39%.
[00:50:05.513 --> 00:50:12.917]  So evidently, all of this $1.6 billion, as in Bravo, it's not working.
[00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:16.979]  And I have reason to believe, Alex, that you've played a major role in that.
[00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:20.883]  Well, I don't really care if I did play a role in it or not.
[00:50:20.903 --> 00:50:24.864]  I mean, I'm sure that to some extent, but it's all of you taking action.
[00:50:24.904 --> 00:50:26.224]  It's people getting wise.
[00:50:26.845 --> 00:50:27.985]  It's people getting informed.
[00:50:28.065 --> 00:50:33.547]  Mainly, it's just citizens being abused by the government or their families being abused is why people are getting wise, brother.
[00:50:33.987 --> 00:50:35.407]  Amen, and thank you, Alex.
[00:50:35.547 --> 00:50:36.368]  Keep up the good work.
[00:50:36.428 --> 00:50:36.848]  Thank you.
[00:50:36.928 --> 00:50:40.289]  I mean, they get on TV and tell you how great the economy is, and that's just, it's not true.
[00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:47.411]  I mean, some people are doing well, but overall, the direction
[00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.396]  Of all of this, it's going down.
[00:50:50.456 --> 00:50:52.280]  The graphs are going down.
[00:50:53.343 --> 00:50:57.914]  The globalists openly say we're going down out of one side of their mouth, but to the public, I tell you, everything's wonderful.
[00:51:02.401 --> 00:51:09.789]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:14.795]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.035 --> 00:51:20.662]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.902 --> 00:51:25.444]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.644 --> 00:51:32.807]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.827 --> 00:51:33.607]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:51:33.647 --> 00:51:37.369]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.529 --> 00:51:40.050]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:46.973]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.213 --> 00:51:52.479]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.499 --> 00:51:52.899]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.733 --> 00:52:06.959]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:15.209]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:22.517]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.697 --> 00:52:23.958]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:52:24.038 --> 00:52:29.942]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:30.142 --> 00:52:35.205]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:35.325 --> 00:52:44.211]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.472 --> 00:52:47.654]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:43.559 --> 00:54:45.080]  Thank you for your sacrifice.
[00:54:45.381 --> 00:54:46.542]  Thank you for what you gave us.
[00:54:47.103 --> 00:54:49.065]  I'm sorry we flushed most of it down the toilet.
[00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:49.946]  We're trying to get it back.
[00:54:50.767 --> 00:54:52.348]  The people will just wake up, we can.
[00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.870]  Or it can get worse.
[00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:56.493]  Jim in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[00:54:56.553 --> 00:54:56.913]  Welcome.
[00:54:56.934 --> 00:54:57.394]  Go ahead.
[00:54:58.095 --> 00:54:59.436]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[00:54:59.596 --> 00:54:59.857]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:00.532 --> 00:55:04.933]  Where are you on your state traffic violation that you had a while back?
[00:55:05.753 --> 00:55:17.297]  I am contesting it and I have to go to one pleading and then I have to go back to the county north of us.
[00:55:17.777 --> 00:55:24.859]  About ten years ago I had the opportunity to rail against four different county level
[00:55:30.356 --> 00:55:30.616]  We're good.
[00:55:57.981 --> 00:56:05.250]  Please convert that into gold and silver coin in order to be absolutely lawful in paying this fine off.
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.862]  And I never did get a response back from them.
[00:56:10.062 --> 00:56:11.923]  Well, there are other simpler ways to do it.
[00:56:11.963 --> 00:56:20.006]  You just go in and call the officer and then demand the calibration records and almost never do they do it every month like they're supposed to and it's thrown out right there.
[00:56:20.247 --> 00:56:20.827]  Absolutely.
[00:56:21.067 --> 00:56:21.707]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:22.047 --> 00:56:22.728]  Anything else, sir?
[00:56:22.748 --> 00:56:23.248]  No, sir.
[00:56:23.628 --> 00:56:23.968]  Thank you.
[00:56:24.409 --> 00:56:26.169]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:27.950]  Let's talk to Dave.
[00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:29.051]  Dave in California.
[00:56:29.091 --> 00:56:29.751]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:56:30.552 --> 00:56:31.552]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:56:31.672 --> 00:56:32.032]  Good, sir.
[00:56:33.493 --> 00:56:34.153]  You hear me okay?
[00:56:34.493 --> 00:56:34.934]  Yes, I do.
[00:56:35.074 --> 00:56:35.514]  Do you hear me?
[00:56:36.365 --> 00:56:39.668]  Yeah, I've got crackling on my end of the phone, so I don't think it's you guys.
[00:56:40.249 --> 00:56:53.502]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I took advantage of that four-disc set that you had, Dark Seekers, Inside Bohemian Grove, Martial Law, American Dictators, and 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:56:55.124 --> 00:56:57.046]  Just wanted to tell you, excellent.
[00:56:57.446 --> 00:56:57.927]  Excellent.
[00:56:58.067 --> 00:56:59.408]  All four were tremendous.
[00:57:00.815 --> 00:57:15.613]  One thing I wanted to bring out, or just kind of touch on, and I know a lot of times you're very serious about what you do, but I have to tell you, I can't watch that part where you interview David Gergen without absolutely just busting up.
[00:57:16.254 --> 00:57:18.657]  I'm sorry, and I hope you don't
[00:57:19.911 --> 00:57:25.174]  Well, no, I mean, he's the Karl Rove of four administrations, and I'm going, you said you didn't run around naked.
[00:57:25.194 --> 00:57:26.174]  Here's the news article.
[00:57:26.414 --> 00:57:27.435]  Are you part of the ritual?
[00:57:27.475 --> 00:57:29.236]  And he just freaks out and says, none of your business.
[00:57:30.196 --> 00:57:32.837]  I mean, he could have just said, no, I don't run around naked.
[00:57:32.877 --> 00:57:34.078]  No, I'm not part of the ritual.
[00:57:34.098 --> 00:57:35.379]  But no, he just blew up.
[00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:45.964]  Yeah, no, I'm referring specifically to the part where you say weaving spiders come out of here.
[00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:48.725]  And if you don't mind me bringing that up.
[00:57:49.249 --> 00:57:49.949]  Well, no!
[00:57:50.009 --> 00:57:50.670]  Why would I mind?
[00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:52.190]  I don't know.
[00:57:52.971 --> 00:57:59.114]  To me, it's the most... I know it's as serious as the New World Order is.
[00:57:59.174 --> 00:58:00.174]  I just wanted to tell you, man.
[00:58:00.335 --> 00:58:03.756]  You know, it just cracks me up, makes me laugh, like nobody's business.
[00:58:04.597 --> 00:58:08.158]  Well, I'm glad that martial law brought you some pleasure.
[00:58:08.859 --> 00:58:12.741]  Well, obviously the movies are serious.
[00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:14.361]  There's no question about it.
[00:58:15.442 --> 00:58:16.823]  But, without a doubt,
[00:58:18.045 --> 00:58:20.246]  That part is quite comical.
[00:58:20.466 --> 00:58:25.947]  I appreciate your call, and I hope you'll spread the word on those videos and share them with people and make some copies.
[00:58:28.107 --> 00:58:29.208]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[00:58:29.228 --> 00:58:30.628]  Yeah, you can watch that video clip.
[00:58:30.648 --> 00:58:32.348]  It's on Infowars.com if you want to see it.
[00:58:32.708 --> 00:58:36.089]  Or just type in the search engine, Alex Jones, David Gergen, video clip.
[00:58:36.489 --> 00:58:39.990]  We'll be right back with The Second Hour, a ton of news, your calls, and Paul Watson.
[00:58:41.283 --> 00:58:46.146]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.186 --> 00:58:46.627]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.787 --> 00:58:47.567]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.787 --> 00:58:53.271]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.631 --> 00:58:55.713]  You want answers?
[00:58:56.013 --> 00:58:56.953]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.755 --> 00:59:09.356]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.916 --> 00:59:14.037]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.419 --> 00:59:22.180]  Well, it's Valentine's Day, 14th day of February 2006.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.841]  Already into the second hour.
[00:59:26.821 --> 00:59:28.842]  I'm going to get into more detail in this hour.
[00:59:28.902 --> 00:59:33.063]  United Arab Emirates firm to operate six major U.S.
[00:59:33.143 --> 00:59:33.463]  ports.
[00:59:34.625 --> 00:59:41.289]  Bush PR, propaganda push, cost taxpayers $1.6 billion, that's paying for your own brainwashing.
[00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:54.956]  We'll also get into a little news clip of Scott McClellan bumbling around yesterday, White House Press Secretary, about the bigger story of Cheney shooting one of his compatriots, one of his buddies.
[00:59:56.053 --> 01:00:04.741]  His comrades, is that his response to it, not letting the sheriff in, declaring national security, controlling the news story, all of that will come up as well.
[01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:11.627]  And we will get into a whole plethora of news on the situation with Iran, new torture developments.
[01:00:12.087 --> 01:00:17.112]  Paul Watson is joining us in 30 minutes, so that is coming up today.
[01:00:18.161 --> 01:00:23.444]  Later in this hour, he'll be with us from the middle of the broadcast through the end for an hour and a half.
[01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.966]  He normally joins us about twice a month from the United Kingdom.
[01:00:27.427 --> 01:00:31.069]  And he's been doing a lot of great reports on a host of issues, so that's coming up.
[01:00:31.569 --> 01:00:33.831]  Right now, let's continue with open phones.
[01:00:34.391 --> 01:00:36.712]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lori in Texas.
[01:00:36.772 --> 01:00:37.453]  Lori, welcome.
[01:00:37.853 --> 01:00:38.313]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:38.433]  Hi.
[01:00:38.654 --> 01:00:39.734]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:39.894 --> 01:00:40.215]  You bet.
[01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:42.576]  How are you doing today on this Happy Valentine's Day?
[01:00:42.916 --> 01:00:43.957]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:00:44.077 --> 01:00:44.637]  Alright, man.
[01:00:44.677 --> 01:00:45.878]  You keep up the good work.
[01:00:45.938 --> 01:00:47.459]  I really don't know where to start here.
[01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:52.700]  But I have wondered because I've never heard you ask this question before.
[01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:55.822]  I have downloaded a copy of the first Patriot Act.
[01:00:56.283 --> 01:00:58.724]  Did you realize that it was actually done in January of 2001?
[01:00:58.805 --> 01:01:02.988]  Well, do you have HR 3162 in front of me?
[01:01:03.088 --> 01:01:03.128]  HR 3162.
[01:01:03.468 --> 01:01:05.890]  And then you go back and you look and you see that it was done again on October 24th, 2001.
[01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:06.750]  And it's called HR 3162 RDX.
[01:01:21.392 --> 01:01:25.275]  Are you saying that you found a copy of the legislation from before 9-11?
[01:01:25.855 --> 01:01:27.737]  Actually, from the National Archives.
[01:01:29.418 --> 01:01:33.721]  And it's dated January 2000 and the third day of January 2001.
[01:01:34.042 --> 01:01:37.344]  Well, Bush wasn't even in office then.
[01:01:38.145 --> 01:01:38.625]  Exactly.
[01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:41.928]  He wasn't sworn in until, what, the 23rd of January.
[01:01:42.668 --> 01:01:45.150]  He'd been elected, yeah, but he wasn't in office yet.
[01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:51.490]  So, I had never heard anybody bring up that contradiction that I found in my research.
[01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:53.351]  I haven't seen that.
[01:01:53.671 --> 01:02:02.618]  The copy I saw was October 27, 2001, and it was... The one I've got is October 24, 2001.
[01:02:03.859 --> 01:02:08.383]  And a few select members of Congress were given an hour and a half to review the 400 plus page.
[01:02:08.603 --> 01:02:09.544]  Yeah, in the middle of the night.
[01:02:11.203 --> 01:02:12.763]  Yes, that's been in the news.
[01:02:12.783 --> 01:02:15.585]  We've also had congressmen and women talking about it on air.
[01:02:16.405 --> 01:02:18.086]  But I know this.
[01:02:18.286 --> 01:02:25.710]  Much of what was in the Patriot Act was old pieces of police state legislation that had failed previously.
[01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.511]  Absolutely.
[01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:30.353]  And that it was a bundling of different police state machinations and measures.
[01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.234]  But no, I was not aware of that.
[01:02:34.149 --> 01:02:38.731]  Send me, if you have an email, obviously you're in the National Archives.
[01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:41.793]  I've been railing against these people for about 10 years now.
[01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:49.536]  Email me links to the National Archives with that copy so I can check that out.
[01:02:49.576 --> 01:02:50.897]  That's interesting.
[01:02:50.977 --> 01:02:54.018]  And then my next thing, have you ever heard of Tom Flacco?
[01:02:55.186 --> 01:03:00.629]  Yes, we haven't had Tom on in about a year, but in the past we've had him on a few times.
[01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:08.553]  Okay, well then you're probably well aware of his cash pay off bonds, murder linked to White House 9-1-1 finance?
[01:03:08.954 --> 01:03:18.679]  Yeah, I don't want to get off into the middle of this, but I haven't had Tom on for a reason in a while, just because I really don't agree with some of the reports that he's been putting out.
[01:03:19.439 --> 01:03:22.963]  And in the past he did a lot of great work and he might be great today.
[01:03:23.043 --> 01:03:24.944]  I just don't see eye to eye with it.
[01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:28.127]  I don't really... I mean I'm sure a lot of that stuff is going on.
[01:03:28.147 --> 01:03:35.154]  I just... Some of the people he surrounded himself with, I just... If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.
[01:03:35.174 --> 01:03:36.115]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:37.616 --> 01:03:38.137]  Anything else?
[01:03:38.277 --> 01:03:40.679]  Hey, good to hear from you Lori.
[01:03:40.699 --> 01:03:41.600]  I appreciate the call.
[01:03:42.578 --> 01:03:47.399]  Jason, Mike, Tom, Michael, and many, many others.
[01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:50.440]  Your calls are coming up after this quick break.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.500]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:57.362]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.602 --> 01:03:58.302]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.402 --> 01:03:59.182]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.522 --> 01:04:04.203]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.543 --> 01:04:11.285]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:13.587]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:16.629]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:21.394]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.594 --> 01:04:25.998]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:33.464]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.724 --> 01:04:36.146]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.048]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.103]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.483 --> 01:05:01.226]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.486 --> 01:05:06.609]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:16.234]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.594 --> 01:05:21.556]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.856 --> 01:05:25.877]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.

[01:06:06.067 --> 01:06:13.972]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.132 --> 01:06:21.177]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:21.397 --> 01:06:22.598]  There are no side effects.

[01:06:57.953 --> 01:06:58.593]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.253 --> 01:07:00.314]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.014 --> 01:07:02.134]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.774 --> 01:07:03.595]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.355 --> 01:07:06.276]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.296 --> 01:07:09.857]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.097 --> 01:07:14.218]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.418 --> 01:07:24.042]  Alright, now 8 minutes, 30 seconds into this second hour.

[01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:34.075]  Jason, Mike, Tom, Michael, many others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:07:35.437 --> 01:07:39.823]  For those that just joined us, you know that thousands of reporters are on government payroll.
[01:07:40.284 --> 01:07:43.949]  Department of Education, Department of Labor, Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:07:45.724 --> 01:07:53.550]  FBI, Department of Commerce, and 1.6 billion was spent in the last two and a half years.
[01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.092]  That's now the Congressional Budget Office's own numbers.
[01:07:56.873 --> 01:08:03.999]  Over a year ago, they did a report on it and said that it was all illegal, totally illegal, and cited federal laws.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.661]  Well, guess what happened?
[01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:11.885]  In the first six months after that report was released,
[01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:16.955]  And we just have until the middle of last year, because they're always about six, eight months behind in this accounting.
[01:08:19.437 --> 01:08:24.861]  The Bush administration actually accelerated the amount of already declared illegal spending.
[01:08:25.742 --> 01:08:33.609]  And folks, it is illegal to go give a reporter $250,000 to not tell the public that he's a paid agent of the government to go out and lie.
[01:08:34.227 --> 01:08:41.176]  It's illegal to pay Tommy Franks $450,000 to go out and push White House policies.
[01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:44.160]  And I would see him, I knew he was on the payroll, I'd see him on Fox News.
[01:08:44.741 --> 01:08:49.347]  And he'd say, he'd always, I'm sure you've seen this, I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, remember during the election.
[01:08:50.348 --> 01:08:51.310]  And I'm not a...
[01:08:52.558 --> 01:08:56.419]  I'm not taking sides here, but I think Bush is doing a great job, and I love the war.
[01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.860]  He'd always lie.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.161]  He'd say, I'm not on their payroll, when he was.
[01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:03.102]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:03.622 --> 01:09:07.283]  Now imagine, he's getting $400-something thousand, somebody else is getting $250,000.
[01:09:07.783 --> 01:09:09.904]  How much money?
[01:09:09.924 --> 01:09:13.765]  $1.6 billion dollars.
[01:09:14.385 --> 01:09:15.266]  Out in the open.
[01:09:15.426 --> 01:09:18.867]  They say it's got to be much more, because they hide a lot of this.
[01:09:20.393 --> 01:09:22.734]  And then hundreds of millions for fake newscasts.
[01:09:22.774 --> 01:09:24.674]  I mean, I know I keep talking about this, but think about it.
[01:09:24.835 --> 01:09:28.636]  Fake newscasts where they don't tell you it's an infomercial, a propaganda-mercial.
[01:09:28.996 --> 01:09:30.036]  They don't tell you any of that.
[01:09:30.056 --> 01:09:30.937]  They just put it out.
[01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:35.998]  And I've heard neocons on the radio defending this.
[01:09:36.058 --> 01:09:37.259]  Well, I bet they're on the payroll.
[01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.780]  It's all extremely suspect.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.141]  I mean, how do we have a free society?
[01:09:43.181 --> 01:09:47.002]  How do we believe anything they're saying when there are billions of dollars
[01:09:47.782 --> 01:09:49.223]  being spent to do all this.
[01:09:49.303 --> 01:10:11.110]  Meanwhile, all these foreign lobbyists, the majority of lobbyists are foreign, are criminally, but it's just no one enforces it, openly at the state and federal level, two lobbyists for each member of Congress, federally, and there's even a higher ratio for state lobbying, as hard as that is to believe, and they're just lobbying to have the entire government and the infrastructure handed over to private companies.
[01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.671]  In some cases, for pennies on the dollar.
[01:10:14.312 --> 01:10:15.613]  We are being looted.
[01:10:15.953 --> 01:10:17.093]  We are being gutted.
[01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:20.815]  As Cynthia McKinney said last week, we are being hollowed out.
[01:10:22.595 --> 01:10:26.357]  And they know you're getting wise to it, so they're militarizing the police against us.
[01:10:26.897 --> 01:10:29.778]  And I'm going to tell the police, hey, you're with us whether you want to be with us or not.
[01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.579]  And you may never figure that out.
[01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:33.680]  You may just go along with this and go down with the ship.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.861]  But you need to know, you are always with us.
[01:10:36.521 --> 01:10:38.162]  I mean, you're going to be abusing this thing too.
[01:10:39.355 --> 01:10:42.316]  And for all the people in government, I mean, it is just horrible.
[01:10:42.356 --> 01:10:45.156]  And both parties are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[01:10:45.176 --> 01:10:46.337]  Now, we're going to go to your calls in a minute.
[01:10:46.357 --> 01:10:47.877]  I want to play this little clip.
[01:10:47.897 --> 01:10:52.578]  This is an exchange with Scott McKellen, the White House Press Secretary.
[01:10:54.198 --> 01:11:01.100]  And he's sitting there going back and forth with members of the press who finally have found some type of spinal column.
[01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:03.511]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:27.906]  This all concerns, of course, the Dick Cheney shooting his buddy in the face and body with a 28-gauge shotgun, and then taking control of the situation and not letting the sheriff talk to him under national security, and controlling the press for 22 hours, and then releasing the story himself word-for-word, it being regurgitated by the local media, and of course they've been absolved by the local constabulary because they know
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.961]  Who their master is.
[01:11:30.081 --> 01:11:32.664]  It's just more example of just lawlessness.
[01:11:32.744 --> 01:11:33.865]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:34.986]  Think about it.
[01:11:35.326 --> 01:11:40.572]  The Vice President of the United States shoots someone and the general public doesn't find out for 21 hours.
[01:11:41.032 --> 01:11:42.934]  Now that's the recipe for an uproar.
[01:11:43.973 --> 01:11:47.854]  What time on Sunday morning did you learn that Vice President Dick Cheney was the shooter?
[01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:48.495]  It was early.
[01:11:48.735 --> 01:11:49.435]  I was woken up.
[01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:55.157]  It fell to White House spokesman Scott McClellan to explain, and he was talking to a group that wasn't exactly buying.
[01:11:55.497 --> 01:11:59.278]  The initial information is coming from his team on the ground with him, and they're just providing this report.
[01:11:59.558 --> 01:12:00.679]  An accident has taken place.
[01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:02.819]  They might not know all the facts at that point, Bill.
[01:12:02.979 --> 01:12:03.960]  They're right there.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.380]  They're out there with him.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.161]  The ones who are providing that information
[01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:11.518]  May have not been right there physically with him and saw exactly what happened.
[01:12:11.558 --> 01:12:11.959]  I don't know.
[01:12:12.579 --> 01:12:15.622]  And yet, clearly, McClellan wasn't in charge of PR on this one.
[01:12:16.062 --> 01:12:17.603]  The Vice President apparently was.
[01:12:18.004 --> 01:12:22.728]  I'm not going to get into all the discussions that are had, but it was the Vice President's office that took the lead on this.
[01:12:23.068 --> 01:12:31.916]  The White House says the shooting took place at 5.30 p.m., and the President didn't know the Vice President was the shooter until 8, because all attention was on Harry Whittington.
[01:12:32.532 --> 01:12:39.752]  That's two and a half hours, according to the White House, when no one told the President Mr. Cheney had shot someone.
[01:12:40.399 --> 01:12:45.721]  But apparently the decisions affecting who knew what when weren't being made at the White House by the President.
[01:12:46.181 --> 01:12:49.522]  They were being made on the ground in Texas by the Vice President.
[01:12:49.962 --> 01:12:54.503]  The decision to have the ranch owner call her local paper to let the general public know of the shooting?
[01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.304]  That was Mr. Cheney's choice as well.
[01:12:57.664 --> 01:12:59.565]  I just want to clarify one thing.
[01:12:59.805 --> 01:13:02.146]  Is it appropriate for a private citizen
[01:13:02.686 --> 01:13:08.828]  To be the person to disseminate the information that the Vice President of the United States has been, has shot someone.
[01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.728]  That's one way to provide information to the public.
[01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:13.329]  The Vice President's office worked with her.
[01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.150]  I should say the Vice President.
[01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:20.231]  The Vice President spoke with her directly and agreed that she should make it public.
[01:13:20.531 --> 01:13:22.132]  And that they would provide additional information.
[01:13:23.445 --> 01:13:26.867]  A rare day here, and by rare we mean once every couple of centuries.
[01:13:26.887 --> 01:13:30.690]  Aaron Burr dueled Alexander Hamilton 201 years ago.
[01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.871]  Shot and killed him.
[01:13:32.391 --> 01:13:37.855]  And that's the last time anyone had to provide any particulars about the Vice President shooting someone.
[01:13:38.115 --> 01:13:38.315]  Bob?
[01:13:39.136 --> 01:13:42.018]  One person we haven't heard from as far as I know is the President.
[01:13:42.058 --> 01:13:43.719]  Did he ever weigh in on this, Jim?
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:49.406]  We had a photo op after an Oval Office appearance today, and of course reporters shouted questions, Bob.
[01:13:49.786 --> 01:13:56.514]  He did not respond, and interestingly enough, the Vice President had been in that meeting, but left just prior to the cameras being let in.
[01:13:58.156 --> 01:13:59.257]  So, there you have it.
[01:14:00.387 --> 01:14:15.017]  And there's a lot of different little wrinkles to this story, but understand, the local police, the local sheriff tried to get in there, as they do in any case, really would be a sheriff's deputy normally, but obviously the sheriff was interested and wanted to know what was going on and wanted to handle this himself.
[01:14:15.337 --> 01:14:16.538]  Very delicate situation.
[01:14:17.318 --> 01:14:22.122]  And just sorry, National Security, Secret Service says you can't talk to him, you can't go near him.
[01:14:23.082 --> 01:14:28.586]  And then we had Secret Service at the hospital keeping people away from the person who'd been shot.
[01:14:29.753 --> 01:14:31.054]  So we don't know what the truth is.
[01:14:31.114 --> 01:14:32.575]  We don't know what's really happened.
[01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:34.877]  There's no telling what really happened.
[01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:36.418]  Chaney could have dropped the gun and shot him.
[01:14:37.579 --> 01:14:43.583]  That would almost be better than having the bird fly over him and doing a 180 and shooting behind him.
[01:14:43.643 --> 01:14:53.030]  And that's just 101 first grade or really kindergarten lesson on dove hunting or quail hunting or grouse or pheasant or anything.
[01:14:54.131 --> 01:14:56.473]  It's just incredibly ridiculous.
[01:14:57.196 --> 01:14:59.017]  But the story isn't the shooting.
[01:14:59.617 --> 01:15:02.879]  That has eclipsed now by their response in the propaganda.
[01:15:03.339 --> 01:15:04.760]  Let's go to Jason in Maryland.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.781]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:06.181]  Welcome.
[01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:07.441]  Hi, thanks.
[01:15:08.322 --> 01:15:12.184]  First, a short question and then a rather longer one.
[01:15:12.684 --> 01:15:15.846]  Do you know the real numbers on the trade deficit?
[01:15:16.566 --> 01:15:18.307]  I mean, our national deficit?
[01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:19.568]  Yes.
[01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:22.949]  The Dallas Morning News reported three years ago that it was $44 trillion.
[01:15:25.263 --> 01:15:28.704]  And of course, we believe those numbers were behind at the time.
[01:15:28.764 --> 01:15:33.604]  Last time we did the numbers about a year ago, it was around $77 trillion.
[01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:38.425]  The public numbers, that is what's owed today, what's owed this year.
[01:15:39.025 --> 01:15:42.286]  What the current debt is, you know, it's like this month you've got your house and car payment.
[01:15:42.306 --> 01:15:43.926]  It's what's owed this month on your budget.
[01:15:44.186 --> 01:15:49.507]  For the country, it is $8 trillion, almost $9 trillion.
[01:15:49.527 --> 01:15:54.228]  They just expanded the debt ceiling earlier last month.
[01:15:55.603 --> 01:16:04.351]  But if you look at the expenditures that have been signed on to, if you look at the obligations, it's over 70 trillion dollars.
[01:16:05.472 --> 01:16:06.152]  That's amazing.
[01:16:07.273 --> 01:16:09.395]  That's certainly not the numbers they're giving on Fox.
[01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:10.936]  Well, people don't have to believe me.
[01:16:10.976 --> 01:16:13.979]  The Dallas Morning News had some of the top economists in the US.
[01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:16.861]  A big article said 40 plus trillion.
[01:16:17.222 --> 01:16:20.104]  No, I would certainly believe you over anything on television.
[01:16:20.144 --> 01:16:21.105]  My second question is,
[01:16:21.687 --> 01:16:26.791]  Have you ever read a book by a man named William Cooper called Behold a Pale Horse?
[01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.754]  You know, I've interviewed Bill a few times.
[01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:34.538]  God rest his soul, he's dead, of course, killed by a SWAT team out there in Arizona.
[01:16:35.519 --> 01:16:36.740]  Red Rock, Arizona, I believe.
[01:16:37.501 --> 01:16:39.142]  In very suspicious circumstances.
[01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:44.627]  And I had read the book, and later he kind of discredited his own book as it gets into
[01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:46.688]  Flying saucers and things.
[01:16:47.028 --> 01:16:52.051]  Most of his work was really great, very talented broadcaster, very intelligent man.
[01:16:52.131 --> 01:16:57.635]  I just think, I don't agree with some of the UFOlogy stuff he got into, because I don't cover that.
[01:16:57.815 --> 01:17:02.938]  So he recanted the UFO stuff, which he claimed to be an eyewitness to?
[01:17:03.158 --> 01:17:06.380]  You know, I don't want to speak for him, but yeah, he backed off of it a lot.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.824]  But you think that the basics of the New World Order stuff that he put in the book were all accurate?
[01:17:13.735 --> 01:17:14.335]  You know, I don't know.
[01:17:14.376 --> 01:17:16.217]  He claims he was in secret meetings and stuff.
[01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.798]  So, I mean, I don't know.
[01:17:18.038 --> 01:17:18.718]  I really can't.
[01:17:19.619 --> 01:17:23.001]  Have you ever heard, other than his book, anything about Mount Weather or...?
[01:17:25.863 --> 01:17:26.063]  No.
[01:17:27.464 --> 01:17:27.804]  Okay.
[01:17:28.084 --> 01:17:28.665]  Well, thank you.
[01:17:28.865 --> 01:17:29.705]  Thank you for the call.
[01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.607]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:33.628]  Mike, thank you for holding.
[01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:34.028]  Go ahead.
[01:17:34.048 --> 01:17:34.889]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:38.051]  You were talking earlier about the Panama Canal.
[01:17:39.097 --> 01:18:00.833]  And I was just reading a book called The Secret Empire, the second part of it, that's available through American Free Press, written by a guy named Cushman Cunningham, who identifies himself as an old oilfield hand, and a guy who had several businesses destroyed by what he identifies as the secret empire.
[01:18:00.853 --> 01:18:07.458]  But he mentions early on in the book, the Panama Canal Treaty negotiation back in 69,
[01:18:09.056 --> 01:18:12.958]  And he claims that that treaty was negotiated by Saul Linowitz.
[01:18:14.039 --> 01:18:17.381]  Linowitz was a high-powered attorney.
[01:18:17.461 --> 01:18:19.282]  He's one of the co-founders of Xerox.
[01:18:21.643 --> 01:18:26.086]  And, you know, he had Carter's blessing, of course.
[01:18:26.106 --> 01:18:26.506]  Stay there.
[01:18:26.546 --> 01:18:28.287]  We'll talk about the Panama Canal when we get back.
[01:18:28.347 --> 01:18:29.268]  Very important subject.
[01:18:29.728 --> 01:18:31.769]  We build it and then just give it to the Chinese.
[01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:33.951]  Hutchison, Wampoa.
[01:18:35.492 --> 01:18:37.573]  Open, you know, front rib of the
[01:18:38.684 --> 01:18:39.806]  Communist Chinese Navy.
[01:18:41.088 --> 01:18:42.670]  All of their captains are.
[01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:43.612]  Many of their ships.
[01:18:44.293 --> 01:18:45.014]  It's really sick.
[01:18:45.575 --> 01:18:47.518]  They got troops there in mass publicly.
[01:18:47.578 --> 01:18:48.619]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.541]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.533 --> 01:19:02.660]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.283]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:19:07.644 --> 01:19:11.567]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:19:11.927 --> 01:19:16.971]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:19:17.371 --> 01:19:21.154]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,

[01:19:50.106 --> 01:19:56.820]  3841.

[01:23:11.588 --> 01:23:22.716]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here live.
[01:23:39.801 --> 01:23:41.902]  Let's go back to Mike in Arizona.
[01:23:41.942 --> 01:23:53.470]  He was bringing up the Panama Canal, which the deal was made, as he said, back in the late 60s right through the 70s, and the Republicans would get up on TV and act like they were fighting the evil Democrats.
[01:23:53.490 --> 01:23:57.793]  Meanwhile, they were getting it up to their eyeballs, and they just handed it over.
[01:23:58.974 --> 01:24:01.435]  And it's all of our infrastructure is being handed over.
[01:24:01.716 --> 01:24:02.336]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:24:03.397 --> 01:24:03.937]  Yeah.
[01:24:04.197 --> 01:24:08.060]  Now, Omar Torrijos was a light colonel in the Panamanian Army.
[01:24:08.584 --> 01:24:09.664]  He was CIA trained.
[01:24:10.224 --> 01:24:14.966]  He overthrew President Arias about 11 days after Arias had been elected.
[01:24:17.026 --> 01:24:21.188]  And, you know, one is tempted to speculate that this was, you know, CIA-backed.
[01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:22.548]  I'm pretty sure it was.
[01:24:22.568 --> 01:24:37.272]  But at any rate, the point is that the treaty, the main purpose of the treaty was to set up a surveillance-free area, zone, the whole country of Panama,
[01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:46.618]  Where the international bankers could come in, set up shop, and not have any kind of scrutiny from anyone, including the IRS.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:55.847]  Presumably he doesn't say this, but down in that part of the world, the only reason I can think of doing that is drug money laundering.
[01:24:58.044 --> 01:24:58.544]  No.
[01:24:58.664 --> 01:24:59.425]  Panama?
[01:25:00.025 --> 01:25:12.094]  I mean, look at Manuel Noriega and the hip pocket of the globalists until he bought too many villas and they got jealous and then suddenly why some college students have been kidnapped and they saved them and they go, we were never kidnapped.
[01:25:12.114 --> 01:25:15.356]  Special Forces troops came here and said, stay here, we're here to save you.
[01:25:15.396 --> 01:25:16.417]  They said, save us from what?
[01:25:17.258 --> 01:25:18.478]  The attack was already going.
[01:25:18.518 --> 01:25:22.882]  It was just one day we wake up and they've attacked Panama and it's patriotic!
[01:25:22.962 --> 01:25:24.703]  Get them evil Panamanians!
[01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:32.753]  Yeah, my understanding is that Noriega didn't want to play footsie with the Banksters.
[01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:35.735]  Well, he had played footsie, but yeah, he was getting a little greedy.
[01:25:36.716 --> 01:25:49.345]  That could be, who knows, but at any rate, the Panama Canal Treaty had less to do with China, I think, than with allowing the bankers a place to, you know, their own little private island there.
[01:25:49.505 --> 01:25:52.328]  Well, they do that in Belize and many other places.
[01:25:52.388 --> 01:25:53.008]  Costa Rica?
[01:25:56.001 --> 01:25:56.942]  That's the only thing I have.
[01:25:57.482 --> 01:26:09.152]  Hey, what do you think about just the wholesale propaganda openly admitting that millions of dollars are spent with fake newscasts lying to the American people and people still trust the media?
[01:26:10.954 --> 01:26:19.541]  Well, you know, you're never going to lose money overestimating the ignorance of the American people.
[01:26:19.621 --> 01:26:21.623]  It's just, what will they put up with?
[01:26:22.063 --> 01:26:22.804]  I'm beginning to wonder.
[01:26:23.663 --> 01:26:26.104]  You know, when are they going to say, enough is enough?
[01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:33.067]  Well, then the Congressional Budget Office and the Governmental Accounting Office and several others say, this is illegal!
[01:26:33.747 --> 01:26:40.210]  Patently on its face, no debating it, and Bush says, no, I make the laws, I decide what's legal and not, and I'm allowed to.
[01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:51.515]  Yeah, but what do you got a president who is openly saying that, I'm going to enforce laws, as in the Patriot Act, whether they
[01:26:51.991 --> 01:26:53.152]  Whether it's renewed or not.
[01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:56.415]  In other words, I'm going to exist laws whether they exist or not.
[01:27:00.478 --> 01:27:01.939]  We've gotten into the surreal here.
[01:27:01.959 --> 01:27:12.768]  I mean, they're just, they're so openly lawless that, you know, I just wonder what Congress is thinking, particularly the Democrats.
[01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:13.529]  I mean, why aren't the
[01:27:14.056 --> 01:27:16.858]  Why aren't the Democrats making hay out of it?
[01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.821]  Because Bush has only vetoed a couple bills.
[01:27:19.861 --> 01:27:20.982]  He signs everything.
[01:27:21.022 --> 01:27:24.084]  I mean, the more money spent than all presidents combined.
[01:27:24.124 --> 01:27:27.427]  Folks, that's Bill Clinton, his daddy, Reagan, all of them.
[01:27:27.447 --> 01:27:31.871]  I mean, more than all presidents combined, and he's not even done with his eight years yet.
[01:27:31.891 --> 01:27:32.892]  He's only six years in.
[01:27:32.932 --> 01:27:35.073]  I mean, it's just an orgy.
[01:27:35.794 --> 01:27:37.535]  They are just looting us.
[01:27:37.956 --> 01:27:39.577]  We're being gutted like a hog.
[01:27:39.677 --> 01:27:41.799]  Yeah, and I think that should tell us something.
[01:27:41.859 --> 01:27:43.100]  I think we're right on the brink of
[01:27:43.849 --> 01:27:48.882]  Of a major, major change where they're not going to
[01:27:49.474 --> 01:27:50.575]  I'm just afraid that Iran is going to be the
[01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:20.590]  We're on the march.
[01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:22.031]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:31:04.548 --> 01:31:07.769]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:07.809 --> 01:31:13.271]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:31:13.311 --> 01:31:22.934]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.075 --> 01:31:24.355]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:29.857]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.357 --> 01:31:34.821]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:34.861 --> 01:31:36.242]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.402 --> 01:31:39.865]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:39.885 --> 01:31:40.866]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:59.336]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:31:59.876 --> 01:32:02.637]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.057 --> 01:32:16.902]  If you want to help us expose the criminals that are in control of our society and who are accelerating our program of looting,
[01:32:18.836 --> 01:32:22.339]  And openly announcing martial law, how wonderful it is, now the President's a dictator.
[01:32:22.399 --> 01:32:23.920]  I mean, that's officially what's been done.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.361]  I mean, I'm not embellishing that.
[01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:26.522]  That is what it is.
[01:32:26.762 --> 01:32:27.542]  It is what it is.
[01:32:28.063 --> 01:32:29.003]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.344]  No weaseling around that point.
[01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:35.868]  All the horrible things we discussed for so long are just calmly being announced right out in front of everyone.
[01:32:35.928 --> 01:32:36.929]  And they're seeing what you do.
[01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:38.310]  They're seeing how you respond.
[01:32:39.378 --> 01:32:42.720]  You know, we're hearing all this talk of martial law and dictators above the law now.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.342]  That's my latest, biggest film, three hours long, really, of any series.
[01:32:47.402 --> 01:32:52.864]  It's Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[01:32:52.904 --> 01:32:53.684]  Why the long title?
[01:32:54.645 --> 01:32:56.406]  Because it's a big film.
[01:32:56.746 --> 01:33:03.569]  We cover the latest police state, you know, with just a shotgun pattern, pun intended, the entire gamut, the gauntlet.
[01:33:04.238 --> 01:33:13.968]  And then we spent over an hour on 9-11, how the globalists carried it out, and then about 45 minutes on the Illuminati, and David Gergen, and confronting him, and the White House advisor blows up.
[01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:23.217]  It's all there, it's a very important film, and it's $24.95, and we've got discounts where you buy that, and then the next video is $5.95.
[01:33:25.305 --> 01:33:29.128]  There are fourteen specials on Infowars.com right now.
[01:33:29.208 --> 01:33:30.188]  Fourteen specials.
[01:33:30.388 --> 01:33:33.330]  Book specials, DVD specials, book DVD combos.
[01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:35.792]  We're carrying, what about one or two?
[01:33:38.414 --> 01:33:40.715]  Every week I'm carrying something new.
[01:33:40.835 --> 01:33:42.536]  And most weeks it's two new items.
[01:33:42.596 --> 01:33:46.119]  Like last week it was the new
[01:33:47.049 --> 01:33:50.592]  A book by Galen Ross, Robert Galen Ross, about the elite.
[01:33:50.612 --> 01:33:54.796]  Don't dare let us tell the people about who the ruling New World Order crowd is and what their goals are.
[01:33:55.296 --> 01:34:00.361]  And we also have his Elite Serial Killers of Lincoln, JFK, RFK, and MLK, a great book.
[01:34:00.761 --> 01:34:05.645]  We're carrying, of course, Joan Vion's Global Straightjacket, UN Global Straightjacket.
[01:34:06.286 --> 01:34:12.491]  We're carrying the Powder Burns book about CIA drug trafficking from a DEA eyewitness who was in Latin America, Celica Stilub.
[01:34:13.448 --> 01:34:16.651]  We are carrying just so many new books and videos.
[01:34:16.692 --> 01:34:21.176]  Loose Change 2, we have that on DVD available, the second edition.
[01:34:21.396 --> 01:34:27.362]  And if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, by the way, you can go watch Loose Change 2 online right now.
[01:34:27.422 --> 01:34:29.384]  It was gracious enough to authorize us to do that.
[01:34:29.865 --> 01:34:36.532]  Ted Pike, some of his videos, all 14 of my films, my weekly TV reports, video reports in studio here at my office.
[01:34:37.867 --> 01:34:38.067]  Thank you.
[01:34:54.697 --> 01:35:00.683]  And then, of course, you can simply go to InfoWars.com to the shopping cart to order the books and videos or t-shirts and bumper stickers.
[01:35:00.743 --> 01:35:01.965]  It's all about getting the word out.
[01:35:02.285 --> 01:35:04.187]  InfoWars.com or CallTollFree.
[01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:08.952]  You can order by calling or you can also ask questions there if you need any questions answered.
[01:35:09.551 --> 01:35:16.513]  And then go order on the website, or if you need the mailing address, it's 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Street, 100 Austin, TX 78704.
[01:35:16.633 --> 01:35:24.496]  Now, Paul Watson joins us at least twice a month, and he's our head honcho over there over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, working with his brother, Steve Watson.
[01:35:39.005 --> 01:35:40.692]  There's a whole gamut of news we're gonna cover.
[01:35:41.807 --> 01:35:45.629]  But before we do that, and of course more of your calls, before we do that, I wanted to bring her up.
[01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:47.250]  She hasn't been on with us in a week or two.
[01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:52.052]  And that's Debbie Morrow, the Made in America Water Filtration Systems.
[01:35:52.092 --> 01:35:55.194]  What I personally use, I used them many years before they were our sponsor.
[01:35:55.674 --> 01:35:57.275]  They are the manufacturer.
[01:35:57.295 --> 01:36:02.298]  So you get distributor deals from them just buying one unit.
[01:36:02.398 --> 01:36:04.319]  You try to buy these units at stores, they're $320.
[01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:07.100]  A knockoff from China or India is $300 or $279.
[01:36:09.581 --> 01:36:12.962]  And these are American-made Berkeys.
[01:36:12.982 --> 01:36:15.463]  They also have British Berkeys, which are excellent if you want those.
[01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:20.165]  And we try to bring you American-made products that also have quality.
[01:36:21.065 --> 01:36:21.825]  And they really do.
[01:36:21.845 --> 01:36:24.486]  And there's some new specials and a new travel Berkey they're offering.
[01:36:24.806 --> 01:36:27.807]  They have the sports bottles as well that are very economical.
[01:36:28.347 --> 01:36:30.428]  Debbie, thank you for spending a few minutes with us.
[01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:31.728]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:36:31.808 --> 01:36:32.989]  Thank you for having me.
[01:36:33.089 --> 01:36:35.029]  It's a beautiful day in Dallas.
[01:36:35.329 --> 01:36:36.510]  It's a beautiful day in Austin.
[01:36:38.288 --> 01:37:02.360]  Well the reason I wanted to specially talk to everybody is I talked to Jim about what kind of specials we were going to have on the new Travel Berkey which people are already buying like crazy because everybody's been waiting for a smaller one that they could put in their boat or their truck or their RV and this Travel Berkey is perfect for that and what we're offering for the special with it is
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:09.502]  The base for the Berkey Light, the one without the light, it fits the Berkey Travel perfect.
[01:37:09.522 --> 01:37:15.185]  So you can get the Travel Berkey up off the counter and get a cup right underneath the thicket.
[01:37:16.125 --> 01:37:20.947]  So we are offering as a free gift with a Travel Berkey purchase.
[01:37:21.007 --> 01:37:29.731]  They can either get a base so that they get it up off or they can get a generic label Berkey Sport Bottle.
[01:37:31.207 --> 01:37:34.210]  Now to be clear, the sports bottles just make water safe to drink.
[01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:36.832]  130 refills of green swamp water.
[01:37:36.852 --> 01:37:39.815]  600 and something refills of tap water.
[01:37:40.115 --> 01:37:44.379]  Cutting out most of the toxins and poisons and making all the bacteria makes it safe to drink.
[01:37:44.739 --> 01:37:46.561]  Those are great for the gym or work or wherever.
[01:37:46.601 --> 01:37:48.122]  You've got to take control of your lives, folks.
[01:37:48.623 --> 01:37:49.483]  Myself included.
[01:37:49.523 --> 01:37:50.985]  I forget to sometimes take mine with me.
[01:37:51.545 --> 01:37:59.112]  And then on top of it, then they have the black murky elements in the stainless steel or in the Lexan, the bulletproof glass type material.
[01:37:59.292 --> 01:37:59.893]  It's plastic.
[01:38:00.433 --> 01:38:03.576]  And they have those, and it takes a few minutes to put them together.
[01:38:03.616 --> 01:38:04.817]  They're gravity fed filters.
[01:38:04.857 --> 01:38:06.218]  That's why spring water is so good.
[01:38:06.539 --> 01:38:07.740]  It goes through the limestone.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.923]  Well, this is the same thing, and it's based on the British design.
[01:38:11.483 --> 01:38:12.404]  We're good to go.
[01:38:35.607 --> 01:38:37.890]  They're the big national maker and distributor.
[01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:42.515]  They've got a big warehouse, a big business, hundreds and hundreds of distributors, stores, shops all over.
[01:38:42.575 --> 01:38:45.438]  They are the top of the line name brand.
[01:38:46.079 --> 01:38:51.085]  Debbie just handles for them just the few radio interviews they do.
[01:38:51.796 --> 01:39:02.843]  Okay, and those are Patriot Freedom Talk shows because Jim Shepard is also a Patriot, and so you're supporting an American company, a Patriot company, and you're supporting this broadcast and international shortwave outreach.
[01:39:02.863 --> 01:39:10.528]  This is how we fund that, because we don't make any money on broadcasting globally to speak of, but we do it because we get so many letters and emails from
[01:39:11.108 --> 01:39:11.589]  We're good to go.
[01:39:32.449 --> 01:39:40.536]  803-4438 or go to Berkeywater.com and in the comments section tell them what free gift you want or go to Infowars.com.
[01:39:40.756 --> 01:39:43.038]  I've got to add that new travel Berkey to our shopping cart.
[01:39:43.058 --> 01:39:48.702]  You can order there and we fax the order over to them same day or sometimes the next day and they ship it out to you at UPS Ground.
[01:39:48.962 --> 01:39:53.926]  So 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[01:39:54.266 --> 01:39:56.188]  Debbie, any other specials or anything we need to know?
[01:39:56.468 --> 01:40:08.180]  Of course we have the Berkey Light Specials, you know, where they get a free Berkey Sport Bottle with the regular Berkey Light, or they get a KDSR Filter or two Sport Bottles with the Berkey Light with Light.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.084]  And all of our stainless steel units come with free Berkey Sport Bottles.
[01:40:12.144 --> 01:40:13.365]  So give me a call.
[01:40:13.445 --> 01:40:18.470]  I'll be glad to find out what it is you're looking for and what kind of nice gift you get with it.
[01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:20.292]  It helps support everybody's airtime.
[01:40:21.314 --> 01:40:21.915]  I think so.
[01:40:42.129 --> 01:40:48.671]  At the old office, but will you mail me the new travel Berkey and put that on my... I will.
[01:40:48.691 --> 01:40:50.712]  Charge me for that and thanks for joining us.
[01:40:51.112 --> 01:40:53.013]  Okay, thank you.
[01:40:53.053 --> 01:40:53.933]  God bless you Debbie.
[01:40:54.213 --> 01:40:59.495]  Always good to have you on with us and I appreciate everybody letting me have her on every couple weeks or every week sometimes because
[01:40:59.895 --> 01:41:04.082]  It's really an important sponsor, and it's a great product, and it's important to get out of this system.
[01:41:04.102 --> 01:41:08.549]  888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com, or order at Infowars.com.
[01:41:08.869 --> 01:41:10.452]  Okay, enough said there.
[01:41:10.472 --> 01:41:11.393]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:41:11.653 --> 01:41:14.698]  Let's now go to Paul Watson, joining us from the UK.
[01:41:15.539 --> 01:41:20.742]  Paul, a lot has happened since we had you on a few weeks ago.
[01:41:20.782 --> 01:41:28.406]  There's a whole bunch of news stories and some articles that you've written, some articles we've collaborated on, but I've got to tell you, you've been doing yeoman work there.
[01:41:28.947 --> 01:41:32.329]  Bring us up to speed on some of the news we're going to cover in the next hour and 18 minutes.
[01:41:33.409 --> 01:41:34.710]  Certainly, Alex.
[01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:38.472]  In the last couple of weeks, obviously, we've had the Muslim riot.
[01:41:38.672 --> 01:41:42.995]  We've put out several articles on that story based around the
[01:41:44.113 --> 01:41:50.675]  Confirmed staged provocateur nature of the riot, the origin of the riot.
[01:41:50.915 --> 01:42:02.059]  At the end of last week we had Bush give a speech about this supposed LA plot to attack the library tower in LA by flying aircraft into it.
[01:42:02.119 --> 01:42:04.200]  That turns out to be a complete fraud.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.701]  It was a politically timed maneuver.
[01:42:07.941 --> 01:42:08.381]  We've had
[01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:13.184]  The NSA spying story continued to rumble on.
[01:42:13.804 --> 01:42:24.027]  The mainstream media following lockstep in with the government news speak, directly listing and taking their orders from the White House.
[01:42:25.068 --> 01:42:32.510]  And then we had, obviously you had Cynthia McKinney on late last week, and she went further than ever before in her comments.
[01:42:32.731 --> 01:42:36.672]  So, just those four stories on their own in the past two weeks have been major.
[01:42:37.914 --> 01:42:44.139]  I tell you what, we also have, I believe, P-2-O-G again, same with the Muslim cartoons of Muhammad.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.283]  We also have the British troops beating up the Iraqi teenagers.
[01:42:49.043 --> 01:42:50.705]  We have so many other things going on.
[01:42:50.725 --> 01:42:54.267]  We have Cheney blasting his hunting buddy in all of the cover-ups there.
[01:42:55.068 --> 01:43:02.274]  But first, let's talk about Fox TV with video of flying saucers blowing up the library tower.
[01:43:03.217 --> 01:43:09.779]  And then cutting back to Bush saying they wanted to blow up that building, and then he renames it the Liberty Tower just because it sounds better.
[01:43:09.799 --> 01:43:12.760]  I mean, now there's no reality connected to anything.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.761]  Just flying saucers flying around, blowing this up.
[01:43:15.781 --> 01:43:18.022]  Then you look at the supposed terrorist he claimed was going to do it.
[01:43:18.402 --> 01:43:21.103]  Turns out he's connected to major U.S.
[01:43:21.143 --> 01:43:22.143]  intelligence agencies.
[01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:24.204]  We've already fingered them as a provocateur.
[01:43:24.964 --> 01:43:26.144]  He just never ends.
[01:43:26.184 --> 01:43:27.445]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[01:43:27.685 --> 01:43:28.285]  Tell us about that.
[01:43:29.605 --> 01:43:31.526]  Well, yeah, it's so syntactic.
[01:43:32.355 --> 01:43:34.677]  The nature of what they were trying to do with this L.A.
[01:43:34.757 --> 01:43:57.639]  terror plot, I mean, I put it that it was as sophisticated as a £300 Pittsburgh Steelers fan after a heavy drinking session because it was so primordial that it was directed at the people who have bought these terror alerts each time they're put out, even though people like Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security Secretary, said that
[01:43:58.522 --> 01:44:04.946]  Um, admitted that they were timed to, um, exploit politically expedient times, such as the election.
[01:44:05.487 --> 01:44:09.449]  And now they're mixing flying saucers into it from Independence Day.
[01:44:09.469 --> 01:44:13.752]  I mean, I thought I was, had, had, had, was having a hallucination when I saw that.
[01:44:14.633 --> 01:44:28.182]  Well, yeah, and that's because as soon as Bush announced that they'd foiled the supposed plot, uh, more than three years after it was supposedly to have happened, um, the mayor of LA, Antonio Villaraigosa, went public and said that
[01:44:28.584 --> 01:44:35.946]  He had no knowledge whatsoever and wasn't told of such a plot, which strongly suggests that the target of the L.A.
[01:44:36.106 --> 01:44:45.328]  Library Tower, not the Liberty Tower, was specifically selected by Karl Rove and the scriptwriters and pulled out of thin air.
[01:44:45.508 --> 01:44:53.290]  Because they had video with their paid-off minions, we just covered billions of fake news, because they had video of a space alien blowing it up.
[01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:55.950]  I mean, I mean, how is space aliens mixed in?
[01:44:56.010 --> 01:44:57.991]  I mean, folks, this is total psyops.
[01:44:59.241 --> 01:45:08.365]  Oh yeah, because they needed to create the fallacy that the attack had taken place, because these terror alerts are about solidifying the possibility.
[01:45:08.465 --> 01:45:17.309]  Yeah, it conjures the original images of the towers imploding and exploding, and it also mixes in all these fears of the alien outsider.
[01:45:17.349 --> 01:45:19.410]  I mean, this was pure Pentagon psyops.
[01:45:20.265 --> 01:45:35.537]  Right, and it further puts in the shadow the unexplained collapse of the Twin Towers, because people saw, after Bush's announcement, this library tower collapsing, and again that solidifies the fallacy that aircraft can make steel buildings collapse.
[01:45:35.577 --> 01:45:44.484]  So it's multi-layered, but in the mind of the passive viewer, when they're watching television, and we've covered the scientific studies on this before,
[01:45:45.071 --> 01:45:51.595]  People suspend disbelief when they're watching fictional television, so it appears as if it's real in that very moment.
[01:45:52.256 --> 01:46:13.190]  So, they were able to embrace the notion that the building really was destroyed by terrorists, and so, as I wrote, that kind of residue remains in the viewer's psyche, and then the response that is solicited means that they accept the passing of the Patriot Act, which they extended immediately after Bush's speech.
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:24.009]  And the justification for spying on Americans, which is how Bush justified that darger, by saying that we use that intelligence to prevent this L.A.
[01:46:24.049 --> 01:46:24.930]  plot from happening.
[01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:37.881]  Then you had, the day after, less than 23 intelligence experts told Capitol Hill Blue that the whole story was completely fabricated for political point storing.
[01:46:40.596 --> 01:46:41.596]  It's admittedly fake.
[01:46:41.876 --> 01:46:55.160]  I mean, we have this on the heels of the new White House memo coming out that mirrors the Downing Street where they wanted to paint up planes like UN aircraft to get them shot down as a pretext for war and stage WMD discoveries.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.821]  I mean, they have absolutely no credibility at any level.
[01:47:00.041 --> 01:47:05.423]  Right, but they continue to put out these terror alerts and terror arrests
[01:47:05.782 --> 01:47:13.147]  You know, where they supposedly apprehend the Al-Qaeda number two, the Al-Qaeda number three, they've done that five or six times over.
[01:47:13.167 --> 01:47:28.436]  Turns out in the last case where that happened, a guy by the name of Al-Libi, it was actually a different Al-Libi with a different spelling of his name, he wasn't actually Al-Qaeda number three, he wasn't the original Al-Libi, but that was never mentioned.
[01:47:28.837 --> 01:47:32.479]  The original story held precedent over the fact that later on it was
[01:47:33.127 --> 01:47:36.190]  Under the spotlight and deemed to be complete fabrication again.
[01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:47.199]  Bottom line, they know that most Americans are totally unconscious now, just mindlessly sucking everything up, so they're mixing flying saucers in, mixing in fake names, just hopping around making stuff up.
[01:47:47.259 --> 01:47:48.360]  It's just totally mindless.
[01:47:49.721 --> 01:47:57.608]  Well yeah, but the hope is, and this is why we do what we do, is that less and less of a majority are
[01:47:58.186 --> 01:48:02.107]  You know, mindless to that extent, where they just lap up what the government tells them.
[01:48:02.127 --> 01:48:04.208]  Paul, why do you think it's so shoddy, though?
[01:48:04.248 --> 01:48:05.688]  It's almost like they want to get caught.
[01:48:05.728 --> 01:48:06.989]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:48:07.049 --> 01:48:15.131]  Or do they think that's the mentality, the low-grade moron mindset of the people they're trying to propagandize, that it just has to be kindergarten-esque?
[01:48:15.211 --> 01:48:19.133]  I mean, it's just grunting, stupefiedly stupid.
[01:48:19.253 --> 01:48:22.834]  It's not even... It's just so easy to just prove everything they say and do.
[01:48:22.994 --> 01:48:23.634]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:25.154 --> 01:48:41.788]  Well, it's the analogy you often make, where the serial killer, almost through a pathology of his own, likes to get caught by kind of revisiting the crime scene, and they revisit these tactics again and again, even though they're exposed again and again for perpetrating absolute frauds on the American people.
[01:48:41.889 --> 01:48:48.094]  Yeah, I think they're just setting, I agree, they're setting the precedent to just run around just being as ridiculous as they want.
[01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:55.044]  Well yeah, and if they can set that as the benchmark, then they don't have to become more sophisticated in their propaganda.
[01:48:55.484 --> 01:49:08.950]  I think the more sophisticated stuff kind of goes on behind the scenes, whereby you have the Pentagon about a month ago, we had the BBC article where they admitted to basically formulating the policy to attack
[01:49:09.369 --> 01:49:14.911]  The internet and declare war on the internet whereby they will put out disinformation.
[01:49:15.111 --> 01:49:18.613]  Yeah, and plant propaganda and shut the web down.
[01:49:19.033 --> 01:49:25.616]  And the whole thing about planting propaganda is that it's all in Iraqi newspapers which is in itself a fallacy.
[01:49:25.636 --> 01:49:28.777]  We're supposed to be over there liberating them and yet we have to lie to them.
[01:49:29.238 --> 01:49:32.199]  If it's so great a situation then why don't they just tell the truth?
[01:49:32.339 --> 01:49:36.221]  Well then they say in their own documents that it's meant to be picked up here, which it is.
[01:49:36.921 --> 01:49:37.081]  Yeah.
[01:49:37.757 --> 01:49:47.969]  But then out of the other side of their mouth, it's admitted that the Pentagon's large portion of this $1.6 billion of propaganda they've bought in the last few years was military propaganda here domestically.
[01:49:48.349 --> 01:49:49.610]  That's from the Congressional...
[01:49:50.738 --> 01:49:53.099]  Oversight group that put out this report.
[01:49:53.539 --> 01:49:55.040]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:58.321]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.441 --> 01:50:02.342]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.382 --> 01:50:06.624]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.964 --> 01:50:10.745]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.885 --> 01:50:12.706]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.866 --> 01:50:16.207]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.227 --> 01:50:17.288]  The medical bills!
[01:50:18.988 --> 01:50:20.949]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.089 --> 01:50:24.130]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:27.191]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.671 --> 01:50:33.773]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.313 --> 01:50:38.115]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:52:54.544 --> 01:53:01.526]  This just in, Harry Weddington
[01:53:10.038 --> 01:53:16.340]  The hunting buddy of Lord Bush, the Austin lawyer, has had a heart attack and is in intensive care.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:28.385]  Let me tell you folks, if he was really 30 yards away and got hit by the shotgun, in almost every case it would just take a few minutes with tweezers and he would have only been hit by maybe 10 BBs if it was number 8 shot.
[01:53:29.605 --> 01:53:33.787]  They're saying that it's a lot more serious than that and very suspicious.
[01:53:35.061 --> 01:53:37.241]  Paul, I tell you, the beat just goes on.
[01:53:37.321 --> 01:53:41.122]  It gets more and more and more and more ridiculous by the minute.
[01:53:42.903 --> 01:54:01.646]  Well, the thing about this Cheney incident is the only thing that sticks out about it to me, because I'm quite wary that it's being saturated so much that it is a kind of distraction from Iran, from the fake terror alerts, I mean the really big fish that they're fraying.
[01:54:02.324 --> 01:54:05.345]  The fact that the left wing is transfixed by this story.
[01:54:05.985 --> 01:54:15.029]  But the important thing about it is that the Sheriff tried to interview Cheney about the incident and the Secret Service rejected that possibility entirely.
[01:54:15.049 --> 01:54:16.209]  Well, let me just read the article.
[01:54:16.269 --> 01:54:18.210]  Hunter shot by Cheney has heart attack.
[01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:19.411]  This is Associated Press.
[01:54:20.191 --> 01:54:27.974]  The 78-year-old lawyer who was shot by Vice President Dick Cheney in a hunting accident has some birdshot lodged in his heart.
[01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:30.375]  Okay, that's the end of it.
[01:54:30.919 --> 01:54:35.803]  Folks, he shot him a lot closer than 30 yards.
[01:54:36.844 --> 01:54:43.028]  A bird shot will not penetrate into the heart, through the ribcage, in between the ribs.
[01:54:43.389 --> 01:54:55.158]  Believe me, believe me, I've shot a lot of birds, I've shot a lot of animals, I used to do a lot of hunting, and let me assure you folks, that especially with a 28 gauge, that this is ridiculous.
[01:54:55.678 --> 01:54:57.079]  This is pure baloney.
[01:54:57.279 --> 01:54:59.481]  He must have dropped the gun or something and shot him.
[01:54:59.861 --> 01:55:01.162]  Very close for this to happen.
[01:55:01.962 --> 01:55:03.183]  It just doesn't work that way.
[01:55:03.203 --> 01:55:04.784]  I mean, it's the old thing.
[01:55:04.824 --> 01:55:13.210]  A kid's stealing watermelons and the old man keeps rock salt in the 12 gauge and you shoot him, you know, at 30 feet with it and just peppers him and goes in a quarter inch.
[01:55:13.650 --> 01:55:17.532]  Believe me, I actually know old-timers who've been shot with rock salt stealing watermelons.
[01:55:18.373 --> 01:55:19.794]  I know shotguns is my point.
[01:55:19.854 --> 01:55:21.115]  I mean, I know the forensics of them.
[01:55:21.135 --> 01:55:21.515]  I know they're
[01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:24.596]  Their trajectory, their energy mass, I know it all.
[01:55:25.617 --> 01:55:28.118]  Frankly, I used to be a gun nut, but when I had time.
[01:55:28.458 --> 01:55:38.082]  The 78-year-old lawyer who was shot by Vice President Dick Cheney in a hunting accident has some birdshot lodged in his heart and had a minor heart attack Tuesday morning.
[01:55:38.403 --> 01:55:43.405]  Hospital officials said the victim, Harry Whittington, was immediately moved back to intensive care unit.
[01:55:43.425 --> 01:55:44.906]  Folks, they've been covering this up the whole time.
[01:55:45.186 --> 01:55:48.827]  I guarantee within 30 minutes of being at the hospital and an x-ray, they saw that in his heart.
[01:55:49.248 --> 01:55:49.668]  They knew.
[01:55:50.588 --> 01:55:54.991]  Was immediately moved back to the intensive care unit for further treatment, said Peter Banko.
[01:55:55.031 --> 01:55:56.271]  So see, they're doling it out now.
[01:55:56.612 --> 01:55:58.933]  The administrator at Corpus Christi Hospital.
[01:56:00.074 --> 01:56:08.738]  And it goes on, Banko said there was an irregularity in the heartbeat caused by a pellet and doctors performed a cardiac catheterization.
[01:56:09.039 --> 01:56:10.559]  That's hardcore, folks.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:16.483]  Woodington expressed a desire to leave the hospital, but Banko said he would probably stay for another week to make sure
[01:56:17.285 --> 01:56:21.287]  More shot doesn't move other organs or to other parts of the body.
[01:56:22.667 --> 01:56:27.249]  The shot doesn't move into the heart without penetrating it in the original blast.
[01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:35.012]  So just more spin here because people don't know anything about, I guess, basic medical procedures, Watson.
[01:56:36.993 --> 01:56:41.395]  Well, if the contention is that Chaney deliberately did this,
[01:56:42.638 --> 01:56:44.219]  Um, then you have to ask why.
[01:56:44.239 --> 01:56:47.301]  You know, is it to intentionally create a distraction?
[01:56:48.061 --> 01:56:53.324]  I know absolutely nothing about guns because I come from a country which is completely disarmed and enslaved.
[01:56:53.464 --> 01:56:56.145]  But, um, when I did... Now that's not true!
[01:56:56.185 --> 01:56:59.707]  You got to shoot a .357 Magnum and a .22 when you were here.
[01:57:00.287 --> 01:57:05.450]  When I did visit Austin, the only thing I really learned was that you don't point loaded guns at people.
[01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:07.171]  Well, that was the first part of the lesson.
[01:57:07.191 --> 01:57:08.571]  Remember we spent about 20 minutes on it?
[01:57:08.592 --> 01:57:10.693]  You guys followed the rules and did a great job.
[01:57:11.093 --> 01:57:11.353]  Yeah.
[01:57:14.409 --> 01:57:15.510]  You know, why has that happened?
[01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:17.871]  Well, Lord Chaney's good.
[01:57:17.931 --> 01:57:18.752]  Don't talk bad about him.
[01:57:18.772 --> 01:57:19.613]  Well, stay there.
[01:57:19.653 --> 01:57:20.894]  We'll talk more about it when we get back.
[01:57:21.474 --> 01:57:21.614]  Ha!
[01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:27.399]  I mean, you gotta feel sorry for this guy he shot, but the story just gets deeper and deeper by the minute.
[01:57:27.739 --> 01:57:29.360]  We'll probably be learning the truth here pretty soon.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:29.841]  Stay with us.

[01:57:51.243 --> 01:57:52.283]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.003 --> 01:57:54.104]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.764 --> 01:57:55.585]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.345 --> 01:57:57.205]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.225 --> 01:58:01.587]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.088 --> 01:58:06.210]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.151 --> 01:58:10.732]  I've got Pelotection with me.
[01:58:11.636 --> 01:58:15.258]  In studio, Kevin Smith who works over here at the office.
[01:58:15.278 --> 01:58:37.487]  I just drug him in here because during the break he was talking about how normally if you shoot a bird at 30-40 yards away that's the limit of these shotguns and it'll barely knock them out of the air and they'll just be injured when you get there so you break their neck and when you get the breast meat out to throw it in the bag that's in your backpack that's got the wine or the seasoning in it you start marinating them right there in the field folks.
[01:58:38.027 --> 01:58:40.331]  Have some water with you, rip the breast out, throw it in there.
[01:58:40.631 --> 01:58:41.913]  When you get back, cook it on the grill.
[01:58:41.953 --> 01:58:42.914]  It's absolutely luscious.
[01:58:43.676 --> 01:58:45.598]  Actually, I'm getting hungry for some quail right now.
[01:58:46.279 --> 01:58:48.122]  And Paul Watson is joining us this hour.
[01:58:48.162 --> 01:58:51.227]  If you don't know, he had a heart attack because Chaney shot him in the heart.
[01:58:51.307 --> 01:58:52.068]  Let me tell you something.
[01:58:52.478 --> 01:59:03.242]  With a .28 gauge, and as a total pea shooter, to get birdshot into the heart, you'd have to be at least, maximum 20 feet away, and it still wouldn't go into the heart.
[01:59:03.522 --> 01:59:17.647]  This is the biggest bunch of bull I've ever heard in my life, for a public that's gone from being the most armed, most gun savvy in the world, to one of the dumbest, I don't know, I don't mean you the audience, I mean middle America, general public, knows nothing about guns.
[01:59:18.007 --> 01:59:19.988]  I wanted to get a comment from Kevin on this, Kevin?
[01:59:20.999 --> 01:59:23.970]  Yeah, Alex, that was always the toughest thing for me to go bird hunting.
[01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.660]  I mean, I really love the ritual of going out with your friends, but...
[01:59:27.236 --> 01:59:34.658]  The thing was, when you shot one, in any distance at all, there was a strong chance, basically, you were just knocking it out of the air with the force of the pellets.
[01:59:34.678 --> 01:59:39.660]  And when you got there, the thing was flopping, and you were going to have to do a big gut check and break the thing's neck.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:41.920]  And that was always the hardest thing for me.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:46.402]  And you could almost squeeze out a lot of those pellets like they were pimples.
[01:59:46.442 --> 01:59:50.003]  I mean, they're just not that deeply penetrated on most shots.
[01:59:50.043 --> 01:59:51.143]  And this is a light bird shot.
[01:59:53.090 --> 01:59:59.015]  Man, hunters know this, police know this who are listening, and again, unfortunately gun owners or people who don't hunt don't know this.
[01:59:59.115 --> 02:00:01.217]  This is a total lie, okay?
[02:00:01.717 --> 02:00:05.240]  To penetrate the heart with birdshot, he had to be very close.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:06.922]  I think Cheney dropped the gun or something.
[02:00:07.142 --> 02:00:08.383]  We're being lied to on this.
[02:00:08.903 --> 02:00:13.607]  And hey, if this can bring them down, a lot of times these crooks go down for small reasons.
[02:00:13.888 --> 02:00:17.811]  Or sometimes somebody falling off their horse in history stops a war happening.
[02:00:19.132 --> 02:00:20.534]  We shouldn't look at this as a bad thing.
[02:00:20.574 --> 02:00:25.218]  This may be God giving us a reprieve or something and one of their main minions gets in trouble.
[02:00:25.478 --> 02:00:30.422]  Or they say they're above the law, maybe he's allowed to shoot people and then lie about it and keep the cops at bay.
[02:00:31.003 --> 02:00:32.004]  Paul Watson, comments.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:50.187]  Well, yeah, I mean, the justification for not allowing the police to talk to him, if it's the Secret Service's detail to protect the President and the Vice President against threats on their livelihood, is that the local police there were a threat to Cheney's livelihood.
[02:00:51.008 --> 02:01:00.912]  So, in not allowing them to talk to him, they're declaring that Cheney is above the law, as Bush has pronounced himself and Gonzales has pronounced Bush to be.
[02:01:02.316 --> 02:01:14.045]  So, even if this follows through and it leads to manslaughter, then if they invoke the, you know, above the law privilege, then what kind of questions will that raise?
[02:01:14.425 --> 02:01:20.049]  Yeah, if this is on purpose, they may just say, we're by the law, and as I said, start barbecuing small children on the White House lawn.
[02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:27.215]  Kevin, when you just heard this a few minutes ago, at the end of the last hour, that he shot the guy in the heart, I mean, what did you first think?
[02:01:28.416 --> 02:01:30.338]  Well, I just know it was cool down there.
[02:01:30.378 --> 02:01:32.299]  These guys are wearing orange reflective vests.
[02:01:32.319 --> 02:01:35.462]  They're probably wearing down jackets underneath that.
[02:01:35.922 --> 02:01:43.968]  And just knowing the penetrating possibilities of light birdshot from any distance away, it just didn't make any sense.
[02:01:44.028 --> 02:01:52.895]  And if you see that picture of Whittington in the local paper, he's this big attorney and over his shoulder out the window is the Frostbank Devil Tower right behind him.
[02:01:53.375 --> 02:01:56.578]  He actually owns the property where Co-Op Radio burned.
[02:01:57.526 --> 02:02:08.181]  a week or so back and I don't know you know this guy supposedly an old hardline Republican contributor maybe he's another one of the Republican conservatives that's had enough of this stuff.
[02:02:08.201 --> 02:02:08.662]  Who knows?
[02:02:09.551 --> 02:02:10.411]  I don't agree with that.
[02:02:10.831 --> 02:02:12.272]  They're not going to kill somebody this way.
[02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:13.472]  They're not going to pull.
[02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:16.472]  They're not going to have Cheney go out and blast them.
[02:02:16.892 --> 02:02:19.553]  Anything else you want to add when we get back, Governor, or are you done?
[02:02:20.053 --> 02:02:20.593]  I think I'm done.
[02:02:20.653 --> 02:02:21.833]  I think I'm done, Alex.
[02:02:21.933 --> 02:02:22.593]  I smell a rat.
[02:02:22.613 --> 02:02:23.494]  Something stinks.
[02:02:23.594 --> 02:02:25.274]  Maybe he dropped a gun accident.
[02:02:25.314 --> 02:02:26.434]  Who knows?
[02:02:26.694 --> 02:02:27.754]  Maybe he's got birdshot.
[02:02:27.774 --> 02:02:28.515]  We're not aware of.
[02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.235]  Maybe it's like kryptonite.
[02:02:31.435 --> 02:02:32.195]  Maybe it's DU.
[02:02:32.275 --> 02:02:33.075]  Maybe he's brought it home.
[02:02:33.095 --> 02:02:34.436]  He's using DU to hunt doves.
[02:02:34.456 --> 02:02:34.856]  Who knows?
[02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:38.131]  Alright, thanks Kevin.
[02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:40.192]  Paul Watson, we'll talk to you more when we get back.
[02:02:40.212 --> 02:02:43.015]  A lot of other key subjects and issues and news we haven't covered.
[02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:44.036]  And your call, stay with us.
[02:02:46.818 --> 02:02:49.660]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.921 --> 02:02:51.502]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:03:03.912 --> 02:03:05.893]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.093 --> 02:03:08.935]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.035 --> 02:03:13.697]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.897 --> 02:03:18.300]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:25.764]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:51.823]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:52.163 --> 02:03:56.265]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.545 --> 02:03:57.105]  We listened.
[02:03:57.405 --> 02:04:02.387]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.667 --> 02:04:03.148]  We listened.
[02:04:03.528 --> 02:04:06.589]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:07.009 --> 02:04:07.529]  We listened.
[02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:11.371]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:04:11.411 --> 02:04:11.951]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.673 --> 02:04:37.574]  4438.
[02:04:36.733 --> 02:04:37.574]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:37.614 --> 02:04:38.555]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.865 --> 02:04:52.950]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[02:04:53.590 --> 02:04:54.391]  I'm Tex Mars.
[02:04:54.811 --> 02:04:58.994]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.
[02:04:59.014 --> 02:05:02.576]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[02:05:03.137 --> 02:05:11.963]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.

[02:05:16.465 --> 02:05:17.886]  Their mysterious symbols.
[02:05:18.226 --> 02:05:19.747]  Their hidden language.
[02:05:20.387 --> 02:05:21.247]  Encyclopedic.
[02:05:21.848 --> 02:05:22.448]  Documented.
[02:05:22.728 --> 02:05:23.668]  Codex Magicka.
[02:05:23.788 --> 02:05:26.830]  Unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.

[02:05:41.383 --> 02:05:45.166]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[02:05:46.787 --> 02:05:52.811]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.431 --> 02:05:56.393]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.887 --> 02:06:00.468]  Welcome back.
[02:06:00.488 --> 02:06:04.493]  We've got about 51 minutes left in this worldwide broadcast today.
[02:06:04.573 --> 02:06:05.834]  Second segment of the third hour.
[02:06:06.335 --> 02:06:10.520]  Thank you for riding along with us, riding shotgun, but that brings up a bad connotation.
[02:06:11.241 --> 02:06:13.083]  Hunter shot by Chaney has heart attack.
[02:06:13.564 --> 02:06:19.371]  Then they spin it in the AP article, because it's all press releases from Dick Chaney, and say that he was shot in the heart.
[02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:31.301]  And then you read it here, it says that the doctors that are treating him are White House doctors, Cheney's White House doctors, and the Secret Service is all bivouacked and won't let anybody in to see him.
[02:06:32.002 --> 02:06:39.370]  And I said this, I said this yesterday, there's no telling what the truth is, how bad this guy's really hurt, because we're dealing with congenital liars.
[02:06:39.871 --> 02:06:41.913]  They wouldn't let the police, do you understand?
[02:06:42.922 --> 02:06:47.747]  The police, the state police, weren't allowed in when they heard this was going on.
[02:06:48.087 --> 02:06:50.029]  The sheriff wasn't allowed in himself.
[02:06:50.049 --> 02:06:52.832]  Of course, the sheriff would have just shoved those federal twits aside.
[02:06:53.653 --> 02:06:58.037]  And they're in there saying because of national security and Chinese safety.
[02:06:58.457 --> 02:06:59.298]  Again, the sheriff.
[02:06:59.318 --> 02:07:00.139]  See, he's evil.
[02:07:00.639 --> 02:07:01.700]  He could be Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:02.982]  He could be planning something.
[02:07:03.923 --> 02:07:06.005]  And no, they're covering up the fact.
[02:07:06.065 --> 02:07:07.346]  And there wouldn't have been a crime here.
[02:07:08.399 --> 02:07:11.821]  You know, Chaney's an idiot and it looks like he probably dropped his shotgun.
[02:07:12.541 --> 02:07:16.843]  It's impossible that at 30 yards he shoots him with a 28 gauge.
[02:07:16.903 --> 02:07:17.884]  A 12 gauge wouldn't do it.
[02:07:18.224 --> 02:07:19.124]  With birdshot in it.
[02:07:19.144 --> 02:07:20.645]  They were saying they were hunting with number 8 shot.
[02:07:20.665 --> 02:07:21.426]  We now know the number.
[02:07:21.446 --> 02:07:29.710]  And it shoots through the vest, through the flesh, through the muscle, through, in between the ribs, however, into the heart.
[02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:31.311]  Penetrating the heart.
[02:07:31.891 --> 02:07:34.092]  Folks, we just talked about it in the last segment.
[02:07:34.858 --> 02:07:38.661]  So many times I've shot quail and dove at 20-30 yards away.
[02:07:38.701 --> 02:07:39.461]  That's the limit.
[02:07:40.282 --> 02:07:42.203]  And it just knocks them out of the air.
[02:07:42.223 --> 02:07:45.625]  It clips a wing or it goes into their breast tissue.
[02:07:46.306 --> 02:07:48.107]  And the bird is alive hopping around.
[02:07:48.147 --> 02:07:48.907]  The dog grabs it.
[02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:50.448]  Or if you're not hunting with dogs, you go grab it.
[02:07:50.468 --> 02:07:51.429]  And you snap its neck.
[02:07:52.029 --> 02:07:54.091]  And you rip its breast meat out.
[02:07:54.511 --> 02:07:55.912]  And you throw it into the bag.
[02:07:55.932 --> 02:07:57.453]  I'm not telling you how to get a good meal.
[02:07:57.493 --> 02:07:58.554]  You just throw it into the bag.
[02:07:59.571 --> 02:08:00.512]  That's in your backpack.
[02:08:00.992 --> 02:08:07.095]  Somebody's carrying a backpack and you put the breast in with the barbecue sauce or the wine or whatever it is you're marinating it.
[02:08:07.115 --> 02:08:10.137]  And when you get back a few hours later, it's ready to go on the grill.
[02:08:11.057 --> 02:08:12.398]  I'm actually starting to salivate.
[02:08:12.438 --> 02:08:13.719]  I haven't really eaten enough today.
[02:08:14.139 --> 02:08:14.579]  Excuse me.
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:15.840]  Very delicious.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:19.742]  But really, fresh quail is really good.
[02:08:20.502 --> 02:08:21.103]  Done that way.
[02:08:22.283 --> 02:08:22.844]  Okay, excuse me.
[02:08:22.884 --> 02:08:23.724]  I'm really getting hungry now.
[02:08:23.824 --> 02:08:25.005]  But side issue.
[02:08:26.053 --> 02:08:27.254]  I've been a while since I went hunting.
[02:08:27.654 --> 02:08:28.554]  I love hunting, folks.
[02:08:28.594 --> 02:08:29.495]  I never have time to do it.
[02:08:29.515 --> 02:08:31.936]  I've given that up for just fighting the New World Order.
[02:08:32.516 --> 02:08:35.257]  Side issue, I'm doing one of my babbling digressions here.
[02:08:36.678 --> 02:08:48.864]  They're saying that 30 yards away, he shoots Whittington, but then I saw the pattern from the Texas Parks and Wildlife report, and he shot him in the side of the face, down across the chest.
[02:08:48.904 --> 02:08:51.185]  It's about a foot and a half, two foot pattern.
[02:08:52.205 --> 02:08:53.806]  And that's indicative of about 20 feet.
[02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:55.947]  Or less.
[02:08:56.947 --> 02:09:00.308]  Especially with one of these smaller shotguns.
[02:09:01.249 --> 02:09:01.609]  And voila!
[02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:03.829]  It's penetrated the heart.
[02:09:05.010 --> 02:09:11.592]  Again, at 30 yards, it doesn't penetrate more than about a millimeter on a dove or a quail.
[02:09:11.672 --> 02:09:13.072]  A little bitty bird.
[02:09:13.092 --> 02:09:16.613]  A bird about three times the size of your parakeet.
[02:09:17.573 --> 02:09:18.854]  This is ridiculous.
[02:09:19.454 --> 02:09:21.874]  And anyone that's done any bird hunting knows this.
[02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:23.075]  So, they're lying.
[02:09:23.455 --> 02:09:23.995]  Period.
[02:09:25.453 --> 02:09:34.736]  It'd be like if cops went to a crime scene and claimed that someone had been killed with a hatchet, and there was no hatchet, but the person had bullet holes in them.
[02:09:35.216 --> 02:09:38.037]  It's just 101, we're being lied to.
[02:09:39.118 --> 02:09:44.300]  Cheney wouldn't let the police in for 22 hours, didn't tell the public, nothing.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:45.840]  Above the law.
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:54.083]  So now we don't know what really happened, we just know they're lying, and that this individual was closer than we think.
[02:09:55.177 --> 02:09:57.179]  We know Dick Cheney blows up and throws fits.
[02:09:57.219 --> 02:09:58.520]  Was the guy arguing with him?
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:01.882]  Did Dick Cheney, what I think is most likely, drop the gun?
[02:10:02.243 --> 02:10:03.724]  Was it leaned up against a tree?
[02:10:03.784 --> 02:10:04.745]  Did it fall over?
[02:10:04.865 --> 02:10:07.207]  That's what it sounds like, and he's 10-15 feet away.
[02:10:07.627 --> 02:10:12.111]  That's what this... I mean, you need to really be 10-15 feet away for a bird shot to go in that deep.
[02:10:12.451 --> 02:10:13.572]  Maximum 20 feet.
[02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:15.513]  And that's at the outside.
[02:10:15.553 --> 02:10:19.877]  And if the guy was wearing a heavy vest, which the news is saying he was, this is baloney!
[02:10:21.338 --> 02:10:22.579]  This is not true.
[02:10:22.659 --> 02:10:23.640]  Okay, now I'm ranting.
[02:10:24.312 --> 02:10:38.276]  I just, uh, Harry Whittington is in the hospital and he went into intensive care and he's got a pellet or pellets in his heart and has White House surgeons, these military surgeons, uh, top surgeons working on him right now.
[02:10:39.197 --> 02:10:42.778]  So it's just, I don't know what to say, they had to catheterize his heart.
[02:10:43.398 --> 02:10:46.919]  The guy, and then they're calling it a mild heart attack, more baloney.
[02:10:48.935 --> 02:10:50.296]  Let's go back to Paul Watson.
[02:10:50.336 --> 02:10:52.137]  Paul, thanks for holding during my ranting.
[02:10:52.177 --> 02:10:54.638]  I mean, is this getting ridiculous or what?
[02:10:56.139 --> 02:10:56.639]  It is, yeah.
[02:10:56.659 --> 02:10:58.420]  There's no doubt that they are lying.
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:02.142]  But I mean, my point is, are they deliberately lying?
[02:11:03.442 --> 02:11:09.786]  You know, in the face of other news stories about the Pentagon having finalized the plans for striking Iran.
[02:11:10.266 --> 02:11:11.927]  Is it a distraction?
[02:11:11.947 --> 02:11:18.310]  Do you think Cheney would fall on his sword this big just to keep the agenda going?
[02:11:19.865 --> 02:11:29.291]  I don't know, Alex, because I've been tracking the news for, you know, five, six years, and when I see a distraction, it normally comes to pass that it is a distraction.
[02:11:29.992 --> 02:11:43.381]  And when you've got every single left-wing website, including the Ford Foundation-controlled ones, having this top of their website every day, in and out, then it's... I don't know, I smell a rat.
[02:11:45.022 --> 02:11:48.304]  No doubt they're lying about it, but, you know, is it like controlled release?
[02:11:50.523 --> 02:11:53.464]  You can't put anything past him, but I think this could sink him.
[02:11:53.664 --> 02:11:58.126]  I mean, I think this is something that is palatable, that people can understand.
[02:11:58.146 --> 02:12:00.767]  Not the shooting the guy.
[02:12:00.827 --> 02:12:03.387]  I mean, if he dropped the gun and shot him, he should have just gone clean with it.
[02:12:03.427 --> 02:12:04.928]  No, he thought he could lie and control it.
[02:12:05.288 --> 02:12:06.708]  That's what I'm seeing through all this.
[02:12:06.748 --> 02:12:07.489]  We don't know, though.
[02:12:07.509 --> 02:12:08.509]  We just know they're lying.
[02:12:08.889 --> 02:12:14.151]  Another example, and telling the local police and the state police, hey, you ain't coming near here.
[02:12:14.471 --> 02:12:15.491]  National security.
[02:12:15.891 --> 02:12:17.592]  I mean, cops, you're now Al Qaeda too?
[02:12:19.915 --> 02:12:22.717]  Well, yeah, that was the main issue to arise out of it for me.
[02:12:23.678 --> 02:12:25.919]  Cheney's protection as being above the law.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:33.484]  Any high official that engages in even suspected criminality is beyond reproach.
[02:12:34.204 --> 02:12:36.786]  So that's what Cheney's invoked in this instance.
[02:12:38.587 --> 02:12:40.829]  Well, explain how delicate these birds are.
[02:12:40.849 --> 02:12:45.372]  I'm not trying to get graphic to gross people out who just like to go buy their meat at the store.
[02:12:46.469 --> 02:12:53.053]  But these birds are so delicate that you just, with your hands, with almost no force, all they are is a flying breast.
[02:12:53.713 --> 02:12:54.533]  It's really good meat.
[02:12:55.354 --> 02:12:55.854]  Dark meat.
[02:12:56.354 --> 02:13:03.418]  And you just pull their wings off and reach in and pull the breast out and throw the guts and the carcass on the ground.
[02:13:04.053 --> 02:13:06.014]  Or let your dog, you know, eat part of it.
[02:13:06.034 --> 02:13:07.634]  They'll get a stomachache if you give them too many.
[02:13:08.535 --> 02:13:12.176]  But I mean, that's, you don't want to really feed the dogs unless you're getting a taste for it.
[02:13:12.196 --> 02:13:16.618]  But side issue, it's just so ridiculous.
[02:13:16.638 --> 02:13:18.298]  This is not how it works.
[02:13:18.418 --> 02:13:22.860]  Understand folks, at 30 yards, the pellets bounce off the birds.
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.022]  It's just, it's so, I knew it was a lie the first time I heard it.
[02:13:27.042 --> 02:13:30.363]  30 yards away, and now it shot him in the heart?
[02:13:31.050 --> 02:13:33.071]  And they lied for days and said he was just fine?
[02:13:33.291 --> 02:13:34.551]  They knew day one.
[02:13:34.591 --> 02:13:35.472]  They knew within an hour.
[02:13:35.532 --> 02:13:38.373]  They knew when they gave the guy an x-ray where the pellets were.
[02:13:40.634 --> 02:13:43.214]  I had a dog one time when I was living in the country.
[02:13:43.254 --> 02:13:47.136]  Got loose and ran off and made somebody mad on their property chasing their sheep.
[02:13:47.196 --> 02:13:48.977]  And my dog came home bleeding.
[02:13:49.017 --> 02:13:51.297]  I took him to the vet and the dog's still alive.
[02:13:51.637 --> 02:13:52.758]  And he had bird shot in him.
[02:13:57.583 --> 02:14:02.905]  So, I mean, believe me, I've looked on X-Ray, I've seen it, and I've worked for a large animal vet and a small animal vet, so I've seen it before.
[02:14:03.285 --> 02:14:05.166]  It just isn't true.
[02:14:06.886 --> 02:14:13.649]  Well, I think I've spent enough time on that.
[02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:14.849]  We're going to go to some calls.
[02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:20.651]  Paul, let's take some calls right now, and then what are some of the other news items that you mentioned last hour that we're going to cover this hour?
[02:14:21.722 --> 02:14:31.328]  Um, Cynthia McKinney's comments, uh, the Muslim riots, and the, uh, newspeak relation to the NSA spying story.
[02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:35.751]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:14:35.791 --> 02:14:37.772]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Texas.
[02:14:37.832 --> 02:14:39.293]  Michael, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:14:39.313 --> 02:14:40.534]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:40.834 --> 02:14:49.459]  Uh, I just... I've been hunting with my dad since I was, like, 12 years old, uh, from the Midwest, and we'd shoot Quell also, and my dad would have me go out
[02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:57.526]  You know, and grab the birds, because like you were saying, it just basically knocks them out of the air and would snap their necks, so I totally agree with you that they're lying.
[02:14:57.546 --> 02:15:09.433]  I mean, maybe Chaney did drop the gun or something, but it just goes to show that they're all just a bunch of liars up there, and it's just completely ridiculous.
[02:15:11.753 --> 02:15:18.275]  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to know what type of shotgun shoots into somebody's heart from 30 yards away.
[02:15:18.675 --> 02:15:20.956]  Yeah, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:15:20.996 --> 02:15:34.940]  I think it's just trying to throw a smoke screen in front of us all to take our eyes off the bigger picture of what's going on, like the problems with China or Korea trying to get us into a nuclear war with Iran.
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:40.022]  I mean, people just need to kind of, you know, wake up and understand that this government's trying to
[02:15:40.529 --> 02:15:51.073]  Lead us into destruction and we not only have the right, but we have a duty to rebel against a system that wants to enslave and destroy all of us.
[02:15:52.573 --> 02:15:53.494]  I agree with you, Paul.
[02:15:55.434 --> 02:16:02.917]  Well yeah, there's also an Associated Press story which came out eight minutes ago, according to what I've just seen.
[02:16:03.706 --> 02:16:19.602]  And it outlines the fact that the White House's PR strategy with this incident is to play into the Daily Show line whereby they make jokes about it, which is what Dick Cheney, the only real comment that Dick Cheney's made are jokes about the incident.
[02:16:20.282 --> 02:16:25.868]  So they're trying to pass it off as a joke and, you know, just clarify it as a mishap.
[02:16:26.469 --> 02:16:27.630]  So that strategy
[02:16:28.286 --> 02:16:28.726]  Probably.
[02:16:28.766 --> 02:16:31.167]  Well, it sounds like a mishap, but I don't care.
[02:16:31.227 --> 02:16:34.889]  The point is they lied about it, and they kept the police out of the investigation.
[02:16:34.909 --> 02:16:35.749]  They're a bunch of crooks.
[02:16:37.229 --> 02:16:45.613]  Well, yeah, but I mean, with this, they're obviously trying to minimize it, which is obviously what they do by, you know, calling it a joke and making jokes about it.
[02:16:46.113 --> 02:16:49.574]  Yeah, well, it's not a joke for the guy fighting for his life with birdshot in his heart.
[02:16:50.535 --> 02:16:56.657]  Well, exactly, and he's the only guy that's going to speak out and say what really happened, so... But we never get to hear from him.
[02:16:57.648 --> 02:17:14.041]  Well, no, and if people say he's an establishment guy, and obviously there were these Swiss ambassadors there as well, and other establishment bigwigs that have been made to shut up, but he's the only guy that would speak out and say what really happened, so it remains to be seen if he has the opportunity to do that.
[02:17:14.362 --> 02:17:15.583]  All right, Mike, thanks for the call.
[02:17:15.603 --> 02:17:17.724]  We'll come back and talk to Jason, Patrick, Jeffrey, and Mike.
[02:17:17.764 --> 02:17:20.927]  That'll be it for calls, those four, because we've got a lot of news to cover.
[02:17:21.807 --> 02:17:29.332]  Cynthia McKinney dropped big bombshells on us last week, and we've codified it into one article that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:17:29.652 --> 02:17:30.532]  Be sure and check it out.
[02:17:30.872 --> 02:17:33.594]  And we'll also get into all the Iran war news coming out.
[02:17:34.094 --> 02:17:39.578]  The British National ID card, they've beat it seven, eight times, but this time they rammed that sucker through yesterday.
[02:17:40.038 --> 02:17:41.219]  We'll cover that as well.
[02:17:41.279 --> 02:17:41.779]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.799 --> 02:17:46.901]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:17:47.241 --> 02:17:49.024]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:17:49.044 --> 02:17:50.526]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:17:50.686 --> 02:17:50.966]  Yes.
[02:17:51.267 --> 02:17:52.108]  You neglect me.
[02:17:52.288 --> 02:17:54.271]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:17:56.094 --> 02:17:57.115]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:17:57.436 --> 02:17:58.317]  I'm getting sick.
[02:17:58.637 --> 02:18:00.821]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:18:01.861 --> 02:18:02.342]  Wait a minute.
[02:18:02.422 --> 02:18:04.042]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:18:04.062 --> 02:18:12.846]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and especially Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[02:18:13.306 --> 02:18:18.789]  Protecta's unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:21.390]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:26.212]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:18:26.432 --> 02:18:28.093]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:18:28.273 --> 02:18:31.595]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[02:20:53.327 --> 02:21:06.260]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.

[02:21:42.159 --> 02:21:46.861]  The press is reporting that it was a really tiny load.
[02:21:46.941 --> 02:21:48.482]  I guess shotgun loads go up to about 10.
[02:21:48.582 --> 02:21:50.983]  I've always hunted with something like a 6.
[02:22:02.023 --> 02:22:12.287]  Or a five, but small size bird shots such as five tungsten matrix load is a poor choice for deployment with a tactical shotgun.
[02:22:12.307 --> 02:22:16.249]  This is a SWAT team website, news information.
[02:22:16.969 --> 02:22:27.234]  Wounds inflicted from bird shot tend to be gruesome yet shallow as they lack the penetration required to reach vital cardiovascular or central nervous system structures.
[02:22:29.065 --> 02:22:33.808]  And that is Gelatin Testing Kent Tungsten Matrix 5 Birdshot.
[02:22:34.269 --> 02:22:34.929]  Statistics.
[02:22:35.189 --> 02:22:35.610]  Range.
[02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:36.310]  3 yards.
[02:22:37.491 --> 02:22:38.131]  Did you hear that?
[02:22:39.152 --> 02:22:39.692]  Shotgun.
[02:22:39.712 --> 02:22:40.413]  18 inch.
[02:22:40.673 --> 02:22:41.113]  Barreled.
[02:22:41.254 --> 02:22:43.935]  Remington 870 Marine Magnum.
[02:22:44.796 --> 02:22:45.136]  Round.
[02:22:45.556 --> 02:22:46.017]  12 gauge.
[02:22:46.037 --> 02:22:50.200]  2-3-4 Kent Tungsten Matrix 5 Birdshot.
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:52.021]  And it goes into what it does.
[02:22:52.101 --> 02:22:54.803]  So at just a couple feet it doesn't even do anything.
[02:22:55.902 --> 02:22:58.203]  Understand, folks, birdshot up close.
[02:22:58.423 --> 02:22:58.944]  That's what I've said.
[02:22:58.964 --> 02:23:05.987]  If you've got a family and you're living in a small house and there's thin walls, 6-7 birdshot, I mean, you're going to have to, like, punch them with it.
[02:23:06.127 --> 02:23:07.308]  And boy, it will kill them, too.
[02:23:07.748 --> 02:23:16.573]  You're a couple feet away from somebody, or maybe 5-6-7 feet away from them, it'll blow a gruesome hole through one end and out the other because of the mass and the speed of the pellets.
[02:23:16.613 --> 02:23:19.214]  But they slow down really fast.
[02:23:20.757 --> 02:23:22.859]  Well again, I live in a country where we're not even allowed to own knives.
[02:23:48.411 --> 02:23:48.871]  Oh yeah!
[02:23:49.312 --> 02:23:57.139]  We're going to go to calls, but before we forget, cover that, because now they're announcing that they're going to decide if you're allowed to have a knife or not, and everybody's got to turn their knives in.
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:11.592]  Yeah, it's a PR campaign launched by the British government, and for weeks and months before they even announced this, they had police walking up to middle-aged white women on the street
[02:24:12.396 --> 02:24:15.660]  Um, asking them if they're concerned about knife crime.
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:25.250]  And it was basically, uh, a method of entrapment to try and, uh, self-implicate these people in, you know, owning knives or carrying knives.
[02:24:26.859 --> 02:24:31.262]  And so they've launched this PR campaign for people to hand in their knives.
[02:24:31.383 --> 02:24:40.070]  They've created amnesty zones at all the police stations in the country where the criminals can hand in their knives.
[02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:45.174]  The criminals who are quite prepared to break into your home and rip you to shreds with said knives.
[02:24:45.875 --> 02:24:51.740]  But we're led to believe that the same criminals will relent in the face of a PR campaign
[02:24:52.390 --> 02:24:54.312]  And happily turning their knives.
[02:24:54.372 --> 02:24:56.433]  Basically, you can't own a knife in a prison.
[02:24:56.714 --> 02:24:59.736]  England is now a giant prison, and they're going ahead to ban the knives.
[02:25:01.217 --> 02:25:18.131]  Yeah, and at the same time, we're fed this line of reasonable force, whereby if somebody breaks into your house, you can try and apprehend them, but if you use anything more than reasonable force, reasonable resistance, then you're committing a criminal offense.
[02:25:19.059 --> 02:25:25.885]  And, uh, we've had famous examples whereby, um, George Harrison, who was getting stabbed by an intruder.
[02:25:26.086 --> 02:25:30.770]  George Harrison, the former Beatles member, was getting stabbed by an intruder who broke into his house.
[02:25:31.430 --> 02:25:41.660]  And he was, um, almost charged with manslaughter because the guy died, um, as he was defending him from attacking him and his wife.
[02:25:42.601 --> 02:25:54.364]  Well, I see cases all the time where the husband comes home, his wife's being beaten and raped, and he stabs the guy five times, and the cops indict him, saying, well, you should have only stabbed him enough to get him off your wife.
[02:25:54.564 --> 02:25:58.144]  Hey, to juice up enough to stab somebody, folks, you're not going to stop.
[02:25:58.804 --> 02:26:01.525]  I mean, you know, you don't just, like, oh, yeah, I'll stab you once.
[02:26:01.545 --> 02:26:02.705]  You've got to, like, get in there.
[02:26:02.725 --> 02:26:05.526]  If you're going to gut up enough to stab somebody, it ain't easy.
[02:26:06.706 --> 02:26:09.267]  Well, yeah, and the same thing with the same token.
[02:26:09.307 --> 02:26:10.607]  I mean, this came
[02:26:11.317 --> 02:26:26.102]  This news story came out at the same time where we heard that people in southern England were being told by police not to call them if shoplifters stole goods worth under £75, which is about $175.
[02:26:26.522 --> 02:26:28.003]  I thought it was £85.
[02:26:28.043 --> 02:26:30.804]  Well, it's pointless.
[02:26:30.824 --> 02:26:35.265]  Yeah, they're saying, you can get in trouble if you call us for shoplifting that's, you know, less than $150, basically.
[02:26:35.285 --> 02:26:35.365]  Yeah.
[02:26:37.896 --> 02:26:50.007]  And then we had stories a couple years ago where people break down in their cars and these hooligans set upon them and start smashing the windscreens trying to get into the car to harm the people in the car.
[02:26:50.047 --> 02:27:01.878]  Well, when I was in England, you'd see... Exactly, you'd see obvious, like, criminal types running by and the cops would ignore them, but then they'd see us dressed nice, going around interviewing people and run over, what are you doing with cameras?
[02:27:02.158 --> 02:27:03.239]  Well, where do you go with cameras?
[02:27:04.079 --> 02:27:07.463]  And I live now in a middle class area.
[02:27:08.383 --> 02:27:12.347]  The police run checkpoints where they fine middle class people for speeding.
[02:27:12.407 --> 02:27:18.634]  I used to live in a lower class area where people would joyride around the estate 24 hours a day and there were no police in sight.
[02:27:19.014 --> 02:27:21.717]  But they can make money out of the middle class people by having
[02:27:24.051 --> 02:27:28.014]  By the way, half the time I talk to you, you go, well, they're burning a car out back at my house.
[02:27:28.054 --> 02:27:31.116]  Well, they're trying to break in right now, but the cops won't help.
[02:27:31.136 --> 02:27:33.418]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.438 --> 02:27:33.918]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.059 --> 02:27:36.960]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.041]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.962 --> 02:27:42.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:48.762]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.022 --> 02:27:51.063]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:51.203 --> 02:27:58.247]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:58.528 --> 02:28:07.113]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:28:07.193 --> 02:28:07.413]  Yes!

[02:28:45.777 --> 02:28:48.798]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:49.118 --> 02:28:54.040]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.641]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.942 --> 02:29:07.845]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[02:29:11.966 --> 02:29:17.013]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.293 --> 02:29:24.042]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.523 --> 02:29:25.064]  What about you?
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:31.163]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:30:46.262 --> 02:30:48.444]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:49.024 --> 02:30:51.886]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:03.293]  All right, we're back live.
[02:31:03.313 --> 02:31:04.273]  Take a few final calls.
[02:31:04.293 --> 02:31:06.775]  Get into a bunch of other news issues and items here.
[02:31:07.835 --> 02:31:11.257]  Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Texas.
[02:31:11.277 --> 02:31:12.378]  A lot of calls from Texas.
[02:31:12.558 --> 02:31:13.399]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[02:31:13.439 --> 02:31:13.819]  Go ahead.
[02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:15.440]  Thank you.
[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:16.881]  God bless you for all you do.
[02:31:16.921 --> 02:31:18.081]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:31:18.821 --> 02:31:22.762]  Just wanted to say, Alex, I know I'm glad you have Mr. Watson on there, too, as well.
[02:31:22.782 --> 02:31:26.363]  I know you don't like to, or you deflect compliments a lot of the times.
[02:31:26.383 --> 02:31:42.068]  You don't want to bring the attention to yourself, but I just want to say thanks for what you do, because for people like you and Paul out there giving us the information, you know, without you guys, we wouldn't know half of what we do, but most of all what I want to thank you guys for, and I think Paul has this ability also, is
[02:31:43.832 --> 02:31:45.013]  Showing us the matrix.
[02:31:45.073 --> 02:31:49.917]  I mean, there's a lot of people out there, you know, saying that it's corrupt and we can see that, but there's so many.
[02:31:50.037 --> 02:32:01.967]  I think that for every move that this corrupt system makes, they also have the double think that they can fool just as many people because it's, you know, like you've been covering for almost a past year now.
[02:32:02.587 --> 02:32:07.791]  Some of this stuff is getting so obvious and so ridiculous that you just wonder what's behind it.
[02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:11.114]  And then you see people run into Democrats or, you know, whatever other little
[02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:16.254]  Fake move that they're gonna make, and they just jump out of the... Oh, I agree.
[02:32:16.294 --> 02:32:25.181]  They're setting it up for the Democrats to come in with all these new powers and do whatever they want, and the Democrats will see them as the saviors and back whatever they do.
[02:32:25.762 --> 02:32:28.164]  And I think it's really important, and I appreciate you doing that.
[02:32:28.184 --> 02:32:38.412]  And the other thing I wanted to say, for the people who are listening out there, you know, who maybe haven't done anything with this information yet, and I'm not saying... There's only one Alex Jones and one
[02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:40.030]  We're all unique.
[02:32:40.090 --> 02:32:47.857]  You know, God created us all unique, but if you're married, you definitely need to sit down with your wife and your family and make this a priority.
[02:32:47.877 --> 02:32:48.818]  I mean, that's what I've done.
[02:32:48.858 --> 02:32:55.784]  Because if you're listening and you're afraid and your wife thinks you're kooky, that's a normal reaction because this information is crazy.
[02:32:55.844 --> 02:33:01.309]  I thought you were crazy when I first heard you speak because it's so off the wall that you think, well, the guy must be crazy.
[02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:02.831]  But you have a responsibility.
[02:33:03.491 --> 02:33:05.073]  Once you find out it's not crazy,
[02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:16.123]  Even if your wife, this is the nature of women, if they think that you're kooky now, if things start to go down and spiral out of control, they're going to look to you as a husband to do something.
[02:33:16.143 --> 02:33:17.543]  Yeah, they're going to listen later.
[02:33:18.044 --> 02:33:29.487]  They're going to listen later, but you need to educate them now, because you need to let them know that this is an emergency, and if your wife's the only one that you would need to do that with, there's some people, it's like the gospel, if they want to hear it, fine, if they don't want to hear it, move on.
[02:33:30.236 --> 02:33:33.198]  You know, I think there's a lot of people out there who are intimidated by the information.
[02:33:33.559 --> 02:33:42.305]  Before I hang up, Alex, I just wanted to ask you, I had heard your comment about the sheriff, who, you know, they told the sheriff not even to come in, and it reminded me of a point.
[02:33:43.006 --> 02:33:55.355]  One, the question I had, and I'll listen off-air, was, I heard that Sheriff Henry Lee in New Orleans had died of a heart attack after that whole incident, where he said he would have the FEMA guards arrested.
[02:33:56.252 --> 02:33:59.775]  And I wanted to know what your comments, first of all, do you know that that's true?
[02:33:59.795 --> 02:34:00.975]  And what were your comments on that?
[02:34:01.015 --> 02:34:03.257]  And God bless you and Paul, and thanks for taking my call.
[02:34:04.298 --> 02:34:05.258]  You know, I miss that.
[02:34:05.298 --> 02:34:06.179]  I miss a lot of things.
[02:34:06.879 --> 02:34:09.421]  We can do a search on it, maybe while another caller is talking.
[02:34:09.441 --> 02:34:10.162]  Paul can.
[02:34:10.182 --> 02:34:16.026]  Did the New Orleans Sheriff, that parish guy, right after I know he said he'd have him arrested, and I knew that all that happened.
[02:34:16.086 --> 02:34:18.147]  Of course, a stress like that will make you have a heart attack.
[02:34:18.187 --> 02:34:20.849]  I don't want to say it was foul play if he did die, but I'm not aware of that.
[02:34:21.149 --> 02:34:21.830]  But as for
[02:34:22.470 --> 02:34:25.312]  People trying to resist the information because it's scary.
[02:34:25.412 --> 02:34:29.614]  Still, folks, the information is true, and so it doesn't go away when you deny it.
[02:34:29.994 --> 02:34:40.220]  And so I've used the analogy of walking through a dark field without a flashlight, and the field's got big pits in it with spikes at the bottom, and you come over and tell somebody, hey, you better not walk in that field without a flashlight.
[02:34:42.521 --> 02:34:46.266]  The person says, no, I just deny that there are pits with spikes in the bottom.
[02:34:46.567 --> 02:34:51.253]  I'm just going to tell you to shut up, and then you're at the bottom of a pit with a spike sticking through your belly.
[02:34:51.874 --> 02:34:55.298]  I mean, folks, believe me, we've seen the pits, we've been to them, we document them.
[02:34:55.499 --> 02:34:57.982]  The pits are real, they're there, you're stumbling around in the dark.
[02:34:58.302 --> 02:35:00.085]  You need to really get up to speed, Paul.
[02:35:01.374 --> 02:35:08.399]  Well yeah, and you make the analogy of the football analogy whereby if you don't go in full throttle then you're more likely to get injured.
[02:35:09.339 --> 02:35:11.201]  Take Cynthia McKinney as an example.
[02:35:11.241 --> 02:35:19.066]  She came out early 2002 and kind of watered down the 9-11 stuff by saying that they may have had prior knowledge.
[02:35:19.705 --> 02:35:29.289]  Now, when you say that they stood down on 9-11, she says yes, she agrees, and now she's directly exposing DynCorp U.S.
[02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:31.770]  government-sponsored sex slave rings.
[02:35:32.270 --> 02:35:35.371]  They ignore her and they leave her alone, and now she's been re-elected.
[02:35:35.871 --> 02:35:41.774]  So if you go in, um, you know, timidly, then they will try and attack you and expose you.
[02:35:41.794 --> 02:35:45.435]  But if you go in full throttle, then all they can do is try and ignore you.
[02:35:46.713 --> 02:35:49.075]  And then you win, as the Gandhi quote goes.
[02:35:49.235 --> 02:35:52.938]  Yeah, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:35:53.138 --> 02:35:55.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeffrey in Missouri.
[02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:56.720]  Jeffrey, go ahead.
[02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:59.482]  How you doing, Mr. Jones, and your guests?
[02:35:59.522 --> 02:35:59.763]  Good.
[02:36:00.223 --> 02:36:00.883]  Good, me too.
[02:36:01.564 --> 02:36:03.485]  I'm recovering from operation, but that's okay.
[02:36:04.246 --> 02:36:07.348]  Hey, I have a few things about Cheney and the military, if you don't mind.
[02:36:07.828 --> 02:36:08.449]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:36:08.869 --> 02:36:10.851]  I think Cheney was an anger issue.
[02:36:11.611 --> 02:36:15.554]  And I believe alcohol is involved because they wouldn't let the local law enforcement in there.
[02:36:16.209 --> 02:36:18.311]  And there's no independent reporting?
[02:36:18.571 --> 02:36:19.933]  Well, we have to know it's suspicious.
[02:36:19.973 --> 02:36:20.773]  We know they lied.
[02:36:20.813 --> 02:36:23.035]  We know he wasn't 30 yards or even 30 feet away.
[02:36:23.056 --> 02:36:27.420]  And we're now getting the actual SWAT team, you know, police handbook numbers here.
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:29.061]  It's even worse than I was saying.
[02:36:29.101 --> 02:36:31.884]  This stuff won't penetrate anything at even 30 feet.
[02:36:31.904 --> 02:36:38.090]  I mean, and that's even, it was number 5 shot, which we were, the report is they were using an even smaller BB load.
[02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:40.612]  And they wouldn't let the police in.
[02:36:40.632 --> 02:36:53.782]  They've got their doctors, government doctors in there, Chinese White House doctors in there, presidential staff doctors, and they lied earlier and said that nothing was serious, but that he was in intensive care.
[02:36:53.822 --> 02:36:56.665]  Now we know he's had a heart attack because of the BB in the heart.
[02:36:56.705 --> 02:36:57.105]  Go ahead.
[02:36:57.505 --> 02:37:03.170]  And the other one I'd like to bring up is really, they had another BRAC, but they didn't tell the American people about it.
[02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:04.171]  They didn't tell us about it.
[02:37:05.011 --> 02:37:06.933]  In January sometime, the Pentagon
[02:37:07.833 --> 02:37:09.735]  Decided to get rid of 36 B-52s.
[02:37:10.075 --> 02:37:23.388]  They're going to get rid of all the F-117 stealth fighters, half of the C-21 transports for VIPs out of Washington, and all the U-2 spy planes, and also cut down the Air Force by 55,498 people.
[02:37:23.428 --> 02:37:23.929]  That's a BRAC.
[02:37:23.989 --> 02:37:24.890]  That's amazing!
[02:37:24.910 --> 02:37:24.970]  Yes.
[02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.930]  Thank you for your call.
[02:37:32.970 --> 02:37:33.711]  I appreciate it.
[02:37:33.851 --> 02:37:35.391]  Let's take one final call here.
[02:37:35.811 --> 02:37:36.852]  Mike in California.
[02:37:36.912 --> 02:37:37.592]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:37:38.012 --> 02:37:38.212]  Hi.
[02:37:38.753 --> 02:37:53.438]  Alex, yesterday you got in at the very last of the program a story about the six major ports in America being sold off to the United Arab Emirates for six billion dollars.
[02:37:53.458 --> 02:37:55.119]  Can you give us any update on that?
[02:37:56.503 --> 02:38:02.850]  Yes, we picked it up in Citizen Watchdog Group, World Tribune, and the Associated Press.
[02:38:04.572 --> 02:38:08.075]  And it says here, United Arab Emirates firm to operate six major U.S.
[02:38:08.156 --> 02:38:08.536]  ports.
[02:38:09.137 --> 02:38:09.998]  This is World Tribune.
[02:38:10.038 --> 02:38:15.463]  The Bush administration has approved a deal in which a United Arab Emirates company would operate six major U.S.
[02:38:15.523 --> 02:38:15.864]  ports.
[02:38:16.804 --> 02:38:18.545]  In the United States, a U.S.
[02:38:18.565 --> 02:38:21.428]  government panel has determined that the U.A.E.
[02:38:21.848 --> 02:38:22.769]  firm, D.P.
[02:38:22.829 --> 02:38:25.511]  World, would not endanger national security.
[02:38:25.891 --> 02:38:26.211]  D.P.
[02:38:26.251 --> 02:38:37.360]  World, based in Dubai, has offered $6.8 billion for the purchase of a British firm that operates the ports of Baltimore, Miami, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, and Philadelphia.
[02:38:37.740 --> 02:38:40.082]  Middle East Newsline reported, D.P.
[02:38:40.122 --> 02:38:42.724]  World intends to acquire the London-based penciler
[02:38:43.674 --> 02:38:47.219]  And, uh, Oriental Steam Navigation and Co.
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:50.545]  The sale was expected to be approved today.
[02:38:51.611 --> 02:39:11.870]  And it goes on, excuse me, Monday, the P&O directors have withdrawn the recommendation of the offer by PSA, which was announced on January 26th and unanimously recommended that P&O stockholders vote in favor of the revised proposals at the meetings, which are now scheduled to take place February 13th, as EP World said in a statement.
[02:39:12.210 --> 02:39:13.071]  The company said the U.S.
[02:39:13.091 --> 02:39:16.134]  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States thoroughly reviewed the potential
[02:39:16.554 --> 02:39:18.775]  Transaction and concluded that they had no objection.
[02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:25.359]  The committee includes representatives from the Departments of Treasury, Defense, Justice, Commerce, State, and Homeland Security.
[02:39:26.339 --> 02:39:27.400]  Okay, does that answer your question?
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:30.401]  Yeah, what was the first source that you quoted?
[02:39:30.602 --> 02:39:31.762]  Citizens something or other?
[02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:35.064]  I just said a citizens group because I don't remember.
[02:39:35.104 --> 02:39:36.725]  It's here on the stack.
[02:39:36.985 --> 02:39:39.866]  But they quoted it from the big Arab newspapers.
[02:39:40.327 --> 02:39:41.147]  It's all over the place.
[02:39:41.227 --> 02:39:42.428]  If you want it, you can just find
[02:39:43.294 --> 02:39:54.037]  I mean, I know some neocons got on the air and implied that it wasn't a true story and I was making it up, so, you know, as usual, some people are asking me to proof it, so, I don't know, just, you know, it's all in the newspapers, so that's all I can tell you.
[02:39:54.337 --> 02:39:55.298]  Is that a done deal now?
[02:39:56.378 --> 02:39:57.338]  Uh, I believe so, yeah.
[02:39:57.358 --> 02:40:02.020]  It says the transaction was expected to go through yesterday, and now they're reporting that it went through, but I don't know.
[02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:03.040]  I'm just reporting the news here.
[02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:03.520]  Okay.
[02:40:03.821 --> 02:40:04.841]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:40:04.901 --> 02:40:05.562]  I appreciate it.
[02:40:05.702 --> 02:40:06.283]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:40:06.343 --> 02:40:07.263]  I appreciate it.
[02:40:07.283 --> 02:40:11.207]  Yeah, I'm the Communist Chinese of the Long Beach Port, the only major deep water port in the West Coast.
[02:40:11.227 --> 02:40:12.488]  That was just basically given to them.
[02:40:12.888 --> 02:40:15.050]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:40:16.071 --> 02:40:19.554]  And, uh, it's the same thing with the Panama Canal.
[02:40:19.614 --> 02:40:21.915]  I mean, it's just, we're going into receivership.
[02:40:21.955 --> 02:40:24.698]  A foreign Spanish company owned by Juan Carlos, predominantly.
[02:40:24.718 --> 02:40:26.900]  It's going to have all our major roads here in Texas, Paul.
[02:40:28.401 --> 02:40:31.964]  Well, yeah, just to pick up on what the previous caller said, um,
[02:40:32.961 --> 02:40:46.136]  I mean, the mindset of Cheney to say he's got an anger problem is understating because he told a senator to bleep off on the Senate floor in public in view of everybody.
[02:40:46.436 --> 02:40:49.980]  Who would do that without having unparalleled arrogance?
[02:40:51.235 --> 02:40:53.457]  He was at the heart of exposing Plain.
[02:40:53.697 --> 02:40:56.319]  You know, he made jokes about Katrina when that happened.
[02:40:56.339 --> 02:40:58.962]  No, it's well known that he throws vicious fits.
[02:40:58.982 --> 02:41:00.483]  He's a vicious, vicious person.
[02:41:00.984 --> 02:41:01.424]  Exactly.
[02:41:01.544 --> 02:41:05.588]  And he's more protected than Bush by the Secret Service.
[02:41:05.788 --> 02:41:09.111]  Bush was in the Ukraine and he had a grenade thrown at him.
[02:41:09.251 --> 02:41:11.694]  And there have been other occasions where Bush has not been
[02:41:12.234 --> 02:41:14.416]  Nowhere near the level as protected as Cheney.
[02:41:14.596 --> 02:41:17.979]  Listen, the White House Press Secretary admitted Cheney's running all this.
[02:41:18.299 --> 02:41:19.681]  Cheney said don't tell Bush.
[02:41:19.741 --> 02:41:21.022]  Cheney is the President.
[02:41:21.562 --> 02:41:24.725]  Yeah, and Cheney visited Philadelphia.
[02:41:24.925 --> 02:41:34.553]  You remember that example where the guy was trying to get home but he was passing through an area where Cheney was visiting and he was tasered for trying to get home.
[02:41:35.054 --> 02:41:39.678]  Also a guy was wrestled away at Madison Square Garden in the VIP area.
[02:41:40.089 --> 02:41:48.391]  Where Cheney was, so the Secret Service are more eager to protect Cheney than they are Bush, because Cheney's obviously higher up in the lungs of power.
[02:41:50.272 --> 02:41:54.313]  And boy, folks, I'm not going to get into it, but it all fits the M.O.
[02:41:54.353 --> 02:41:55.834]  He is a brutal person.
[02:41:57.074 --> 02:41:58.014]  Very vicious.
[02:41:59.635 --> 02:42:00.335]  Oh my goodness.
[02:42:00.735 --> 02:42:05.196]  Paul, let's get into some of the other news items that you mentioned in the last hour.
[02:42:05.236 --> 02:42:06.977]  We've got about 15 minutes to cover them.
[02:42:06.997 --> 02:42:07.317]  Go ahead.
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:11.622]  Yeah, the Muslim riots.
[02:42:12.463 --> 02:42:15.445]  Early indications show that it was a provocation.
[02:42:16.466 --> 02:42:36.080]  The first cartoons that were handed out that were included in the set that were apparently published originally, but they in fact weren't, were of a more degrading nature, were handed out by this Danish imam and were just bundled in with the cartoons that were actually published.
[02:42:36.897 --> 02:42:42.658]  The ones that were published by the Danish newspaper, the Danish newspaper was a top neocon newspaper.
[02:42:42.678 --> 02:42:45.099]  It had Bilderberg links.
[02:42:45.299 --> 02:42:52.221]  And so then we got the Muslims stirred up over all the images together, even though some of them weren't printed in the newspapers.
[02:42:53.301 --> 02:43:01.663]  We have two separate top Russian MPs saying that the Muslim riots were directly orchestrated as a siot.
[02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:03.491]  On behalf of the U.S.
[02:43:03.551 --> 02:43:07.474]  government to provoke a row between Europe and the Islamic world.
[02:43:07.574 --> 02:43:09.075]  And MPs are members of Parliament.
[02:43:09.095 --> 02:43:14.419]  What do you think of this new video where, ooh yeah, beat them up, yeah, where they're just beating up innocent Iraqi teenagers?
[02:43:14.439 --> 02:43:17.702]  I mean, that's really an opportune time to keep the Arabs stirred up.
[02:43:19.263 --> 02:43:22.866]  Well, yeah, it fits into P2OG, but the interesting thing is
[02:43:23.638 --> 02:43:46.347]  Whereas in America, the recruiting ads for the military, from what I've seen, are kind of directed to be noble, and that you're defending America, and it's a noble cause, it's interesting that the ads for joining the Marines and the military in Britain are about kids nearly being drowned by shoving their heads under the water, and the pitch is 99.9% need not apply,
[02:43:50.618 --> 02:43:56.263]  So, I mean, that in itself causes people with a certain disposition to apply in the first place.
[02:43:57.684 --> 02:44:16.719]  And it's another example of the Abu Ghraib torture policy, which was initiated by Rumsfeld and Cheney, just playing out, whereby these actions are authorized by the highest echelons of power, and then whenever they get caught, they burn the lower-level minions, and it all gets put in the back of the newspaper.
[02:44:19.730 --> 02:44:28.393]  Three months ago, the example of the British soldiers beating each other up, wrestling naked, kicking each other directly in the head.
[02:44:29.034 --> 02:44:34.396]  So it's all basically a tribal initiation to even get in the army in the first place.
[02:44:34.456 --> 02:44:43.279]  So then when they do it to Iraqi teenagers, they see it as no big deal because their commanders were doing it to them when they joined the army in the first place.
[02:44:43.299 --> 02:44:46.160]  So they don't even see it as a big deal to do that.
[02:44:48.484 --> 02:44:53.606]  There are a lot of other issues that have developed in the last few weeks since you were on.
[02:44:53.646 --> 02:44:54.747]  Let's get into those, Paul.
[02:44:56.127 --> 02:45:05.771]  Yeah, we've got the NSA spying story, which now has been turned into the terrorist surveillance program.
[02:45:05.811 --> 02:45:15.295]  The White House called it that in late January, and immediately the news network, not just Fox, now the Associated Press,
[02:45:15.777 --> 02:45:19.503]  I've picked up that term, terrorist surveillance program.
[02:45:20.344 --> 02:45:25.753]  So if you know, why would you be against listening to Osama bin Laden if he's making a phone call?
[02:45:26.405 --> 02:45:46.898]  And it plays directly into what George Orwell described as Newspeak, which I got the definition off one of the websites which studied it, to provide a medium of expression for the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible.
[02:45:47.638 --> 02:45:48.239]  So it's about
[02:45:49.398 --> 02:45:59.745]  Setting new vocabulary terms around issues to change their very definition, even though it's completely anathema to the truth of the initial story.
[02:46:00.466 --> 02:46:14.035]  Which is that, as you've said, the NSA has been spying on Americans through Echelon for at least two decades, and the Pentagon has directly been spying on domestic peace organizations for the past five years.
[02:46:16.781 --> 02:46:37.213]  And in the Patriot Act, Section 213 and 215, it just openly says we have administrative subpoenas that aren't even warrants issued by the very agencies for whole dragnets of just going in houses, businesses, you name it, and searching whatever you want, leaving whatever you want, and if anybody catches you, you order them under national security to never tell anyone or you're charged as a terrorist.
[02:46:37.513 --> 02:46:39.755]  Now there's direct spying without warrants right there!
[02:46:41.556 --> 02:46:43.377]  Yeah, which is interesting because
[02:46:44.483 --> 02:46:50.024]  The very fruits of the American Revolution were about how the British had complete search and seizure power.
[02:46:50.304 --> 02:46:54.845]  And then they have the nerve, Gonzalez gets up and says, no, this is what George Washington did.
[02:46:55.145 --> 02:46:57.426]  He did electronic surveillance without warrants.
[02:46:58.066 --> 02:47:00.366]  He also flew in jet airplanes and went to the moon.
[02:47:02.107 --> 02:47:05.367]  Yeah, he did electronic surveillance without electricity.
[02:47:06.108 --> 02:47:08.068]  Somehow he must have conjured it up magically.
[02:47:09.028 --> 02:47:12.289]  But I mean, Village Voice did a big piece on it where that's
[02:47:12.890 --> 02:47:16.791]  That's what the Committee of Correspondence's idea was about.
[02:47:17.071 --> 02:47:25.773]  Communicating the fact that the British proclaim the power to invade any American's home and search their papers and seize anything they like.
[02:47:26.154 --> 02:47:29.975]  That was the start of the American Revolution.
[02:47:32.135 --> 02:47:33.736]  Yeah, but George Washington loved it.
[02:47:33.756 --> 02:47:35.716]  According to Gonzales, he doesn't lie, Paul.
[02:47:37.276 --> 02:47:39.157]  No, and Bush is above the law, naturally.
[02:47:39.933 --> 02:47:40.534]  Well, let me get back.
[02:47:40.554 --> 02:47:41.835]  I want to just briefly mention this.
[02:47:41.855 --> 02:47:50.883]  A Florida man charged in sex slave trade, a man has been arrested on charges he smuggled two Mexican migrants into the United States and sold them as part of a sex slave trade, authorities said.
[02:47:50.903 --> 02:47:54.867]  Alicio Escalante Santos,
[02:47:55.567 --> 02:47:56.729]  Now, let's stop right there.
[02:48:17.396 --> 02:48:20.420]  Why is it the FBI raiding Dime Corps in Halliburton right now?
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:25.505]  They openly have lobbyists, Chicago Tribune lobbying for their sex trade, slave trade.
[02:48:26.126 --> 02:48:37.639]  See, I mean, they'll go buy some little, little maggot, but they won't go after the king, king worms, the king demons, the king scum, I don't have words for them, buckets of pus, whatever you want to call them.
[02:48:38.995 --> 02:48:41.038]  And believe me, Cheney and all of them are into this, folks.
[02:48:41.058 --> 02:48:43.820]  If you only knew, they're just, they are, they are pig demons.
[02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:45.502]  They are murdering trash.
[02:48:45.762 --> 02:48:50.087]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.287 --> 02:48:54.712]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.852 --> 02:48:59.216]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.276 --> 02:49:00.618]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.357 --> 02:49:01.758]  Panama!
[02:49:02.398 --> 02:49:03.179]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:17.274 --> 02:49:18.454]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:49:46.050 --> 02:49:49.054]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.414 --> 02:49:58.224]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.564 --> 02:50:03.230]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.690 --> 02:50:10.414]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.815 --> 02:50:22.602]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.062 --> 02:50:27.525]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.706 --> 02:50:30.007]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:30.027 --> 02:50:32.009]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:50:35.431 --> 02:50:36.412]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:47.077]  Thank you.

[02:51:31.485 --> 02:51:34.567]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.727 --> 02:51:40.593]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:48.493 --> 02:51:49.294]  Right, exactly.
[02:51:49.314 --> 02:51:50.395]  It's not a story.
[02:52:18.750 --> 02:52:27.141]  Uh, take Dutro, the Belgian case, uh, where the victim said that senior judges, uh, politicians, bankers were involved.
[02:52:27.221 --> 02:52:31.206]  And they found a bunch of dead toddlers, folks, and satanic, uh, altars and everything.
[02:52:31.227 --> 02:52:31.927]  This isn't a joke.
[02:52:33.289 --> 02:52:35.212]  But the fact is, Dutro himself
[02:52:36.249 --> 02:52:42.011]  He admitted that he was providing these sex slaves, these children, for the elite.
[02:52:42.351 --> 02:52:48.674]  He admitted it in the court case, but it was not investigated because the people investigating it were involved in it.
[02:52:48.994 --> 02:52:50.835]  And what was the biggest march ever in history?
[02:52:50.875 --> 02:52:58.178]  Like three million people marched and the normally passive population was about to burn all the police stations down until they finally put them in prison.
[02:52:58.198 --> 02:52:59.038]  They weren't even going to do that.
[02:52:59.058 --> 02:53:00.819]  It's like, oh, you're allowed to murder toddlers.
[02:53:00.839 --> 02:53:01.279]  That's okay.
[02:53:02.324 --> 02:53:15.312]  Yeah, and then we had a case in Britain, um, Holly and Jessica Chapman, who were two, um, eight-year-old girls that were murdered, and it turned out that the, um, chief of police investigating the case was involved in paedophile rings.
[02:53:15.352 --> 02:53:19.154]  Again, so, the people investigating the crime are the criminals.
[02:53:19.615 --> 02:53:22.476]  Um... Well, who else do you get to remote-control planes into buildings?
[02:53:22.496 --> 02:53:23.817]  Who else do you get to do this?
[02:53:24.157 --> 02:53:26.739]  They're a bunch of... it's just... they're demons, people!
[02:53:27.359 --> 02:53:28.320]  Absolute demons!
[02:53:29.159 --> 02:53:32.620]  Yeah, which is why the pedophile rings always lead back to satanic rings.
[02:53:33.081 --> 02:53:41.464]  Hand in hand, every time, in France, Portugal, Australia, and the Australian case involves Spain, Italy, the British Royal Family.
[02:53:41.584 --> 02:53:41.844]  Yeah.
[02:53:42.284 --> 02:53:43.525]  Chile, Bosnia.
[02:53:43.765 --> 02:53:47.486]  They dug up dead bodies at the Royal Combat on the Netherlands of kids?
[02:53:49.027 --> 02:53:50.647]  Yeah, this is what they engage in.
[02:53:50.887 --> 02:53:52.108]  This is their fetish.
[02:53:52.988 --> 02:53:54.609]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[02:53:55.902 --> 02:53:58.183]  More dead women found at the castle.
[02:53:58.243 --> 02:53:59.704]  More dead children found.
[02:54:00.504 --> 02:54:01.505]  No big deal.
[02:54:03.906 --> 02:54:04.686]  Look at this article.
[02:54:05.566 --> 02:54:08.688]  Expelled Tibetans protest Google censorship.
[02:54:08.708 --> 02:54:12.330]  So now Google's blocking things like Gulag.
[02:54:12.370 --> 02:54:13.670]  You can't learn about those.
[02:54:14.010 --> 02:54:15.611]  Yahoo and everybody else is doing it.
[02:54:15.651 --> 02:54:16.692]  It's just freedom, Paul.
[02:54:18.252 --> 02:54:24.015]  Well, yeah, and it's all tied into the initial wave, which is to charge per email sent.
[02:54:24.887 --> 02:54:34.754]  Which is the first step in the regulation of the Internet and the forced migration over to Internet 2, which is completely government regulated, whereby you need permission to own a website.
[02:54:35.694 --> 02:54:42.919]  It's simple, it's like you've got an existing road and they shut it down to one lane, then they force you over to the new toll road that has all the restrictions.
[02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:43.960]  That's what they're doing with Internet 2.
[02:54:45.712 --> 02:54:49.516]  Yeah, and Google's corporate motto is, don't be evil.
[02:54:50.397 --> 02:54:56.843]  And now they're centering in China, and the Chinese model, as it is for most things, is the model to be introduced in America.
[02:54:56.883 --> 02:55:02.028]  Yeah, we've got to find some other alternative search engines that are good that don't do this, but it seems like they're all doing it.
[02:55:02.448 --> 02:55:04.470]  And of course, it's already going on to some extent here, too.
[02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:07.493]  Paul, in the last minute, we've got LeftPrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:07.773 --> 02:55:09.675]  We've added a lot of new features, a lot of new media.
