[00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:06.816]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:08.538]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:10.379]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.821]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.581 --> 00:00:13.502]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:18.066]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:22.470]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:28.476]  I have been bucking and engaging, chomping at the bit.
[00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:30.758]  Been like a tempest in a little teapot.
[00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:37.731]  Since last night, frankly every day, I'm just getting more and more angry.
[00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:39.852]  But more than just angry, focused.
[00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:42.993]  And I realize how serious things are.
[00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.015]  And things are just disgusting me at levels that they haven't in years.
[00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:48.856]  And frankly, that's healthy.
[00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:51.237]  I mean, I've been getting conditioned.
[00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:59.416]  To Big Brother, in condition to all the police state things that are happening, and getting more and more acclimated to it in the last few years.
[00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:03.959]  And I really, lately on air, it's been like the old days.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.887]  Maybe it's good that I've been yelling and screaming and freaking out, because we need to yell and scream and freak out.
[00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:18.572]  This is yelling and screaming and freaking out type stuff that we're dealing with.
[00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:28.768]  Remember about two years ago there was a New York Times article saying how great it was going to be that the Pentagon had a plan for your local cities with grants.
[00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.891]  Yes, the Pentagon with grants.
[00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:36.057]  That every citizen will actually be made
[00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:46.697]  To watch a computer terminal several hours a week at first, and people who wish to be paid will watch it upwards of 20 hours a week.
[00:01:47.138 --> 00:01:51.180]  And they will randomly watch CCTV cameras in different cities.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.522]  It said if you were in Chicago, you'd watch Dallas, Texas.
[00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:58.205]  And if you were in Dallas, Texas, you'd be watching some town in Idaho.
[00:01:58.225 --> 00:02:01.027]  Because we can't have our own citizens watching our own people.
[00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:03.068]  That might open it up to harassment.
[00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:26.923]  And that they were going to have simulated images of terrorists, so real, you couldn't tell the difference via the video feeds that people were watching, because they said there'll never really be any real terrorism, so we've got to simulate it to see if people are on their toes, and then they will instantly then activate it and notify the police department through a filing system.
[00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:30.484]  Yes, it's science fiction, but we're in the 2000s now.
[00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:38.481]  And just a few weeks ago, I had a Homeland Security professor on who's teaching 14 classes.
[00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:44.703]  He's the dean over 14 classes of Homeland Security at one university in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[00:02:45.324 --> 00:02:54.907]  And they're recruiting hundreds and hundreds of people to go online and post little tattletale reports on all crime, terrorism, and of course, threats.
[00:02:55.127 --> 00:03:00.449]  So, again, there's no real terrorism, but the classical sense, but everything is terrorism.
[00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.297]  Well, guess what?
[00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:04.478]  It's going to be on British Cable TV.
[00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:09.141]  You have your own channels, hundreds of them, of surveillance cameras.
[00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:15.005]  You can flip around on them real time and watch any camera you want and tattle on people.
[00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:19.689]  It's so much fun and even get goodies for doing it.
[00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:28.415]  And yes, of course, your community service will be having to watch the cable and tattle on people here in America.
[00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:31.844]  And in England, of course.
[00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:35.425]  So, again, just the ultra-depths of Big Brother.
[00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:36.505]  Ultra-depths.
[00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:43.227]  And I've literally, no exaggeration, got about 35 articles today that are, frankly, even worse than this.
[00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:46.188]  I have an audio clip I'm not sure I even want to play.
[00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:51.810]  It's a high-level Bush administration official saying that they can torture small children and crush their genitalia.
[00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.411]  I can't really say more than that on air.
[00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.472]  And this was given in a major symposium at a major university.
[00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:02.688]  And it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:13.314]  You know, I said I wasn't joking when I said they'd probably be barbecuing small children on the White House lawn or maybe cutting the tops of their heads off and eating their brains with a dull spoon and calling it love of the Lord.
[00:04:13.334 --> 00:04:17.816]  You know, I joke about those things, but anything I joke about ends up happening.
[00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:24.540]  Paul Watson, three weeks ago, wrote an article where these people were defending torture and he said, you know, what's next?
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.061]  Burning children with Bunsen burners?
[00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:30.733]  No, no, it's worse than that, Paul, and we now have the clip.
[00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:39.171]  The Bush administration, a high-level official, says we will crush children's testicles in front of their parents.
[00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:47.928]  So there's your loving government, getting you ready for the equivalent of a red Nazi terror, the likes of which the world's never seen.
[00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.411]  And I know most of us will roll over and just ask them to blow our heads off.
[00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:54.312]  Oh, government, thank you!
[00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:56.133]  Blow my head off!
[00:04:56.373 --> 00:04:57.214]  You're so good!
[00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:06.263]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:10.909]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.435]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:16.817]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:18.339]  Panama!
[00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:22.802]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.862 --> 00:05:29.787]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.989]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:42.656]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:43.797]  If you want to understand
[00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:44.197]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:12.498]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:20.202]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:20.963]  I don't know.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.344]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:42.306]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:48.431]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:52.615]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.635 --> 00:06:53.196]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:05.205 --> 00:07:10.468]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:21.635]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:29.720]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.962]  This is real, not science fiction.
[00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:41.341]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:53.490]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.894]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:08.319]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.282 --> 00:08:20.104]  Welcome, my friends, 8 minutes, 15 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:21.444 --> 00:08:30.408]  We have a UT professor coming on who wrote, I think, a really fair book, very accurate, about Andrew Jackson,
[00:08:31.718 --> 00:08:33.059]  An amazing president.
[00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:34.220]  I mean, a orphan.
[00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:36.843]  His mother died in the Revolutionary War.
[00:08:36.863 --> 00:08:39.485]  He was in the Revolutionary War when he was 12 years old.
[00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:40.806]  Both his brothers died.
[00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:42.888]  His father died before he was born.
[00:08:42.968 --> 00:08:49.174]  He was on the front lines of the wilds of South Carolina.
[00:08:50.126 --> 00:09:02.379]  When it was the very edge of the frontier and his whole life he beat Lord Wellington's armies that had never been beaten by anybody in history when he was fifty-something years old at the Battles of New Orleans.
[00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.001]  I say battles because there was two battles.
[00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.302]  It's called the Battle of New Orleans.
[00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:10.568]  Then of course he went on to be President, defeat the big central banks that are our Federal Reserve today.
[00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:11.809]  They were able to take us down in 1913.
[00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:22.135]  So, Andrew Jackson, often demonized, you'll learn why from a UT professor, who is also a best-selling author, who is scheduled to join us in the second hour.
[00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:28.639]  And then Paul Joseph Watson joins us from his report from the prison planet that our planet is being turned into.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:37.164]  He joins us from Sheffield, England to talk about Larry Silverstein, the owner of the World Trade Center 7, giving us his new excuse for why he said he blew the buildings up.
[00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:39.826]  All the evidence shows they blew them up, but he admitted he blew them up.
[00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:45.231]  We'll also get into the latest torture developments, the police state developments.
[00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:54.960]  There is so much more with Paul Joseph Watson, the editor over at PrisonPlanet.com, one of my great news services and websites.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.183]  You know, we've signed up, I don't know, what is it, like seven news stations the last two weeks?
[00:10:01.013 --> 00:10:07.176]  The Great Affiliate Relations sent me an email, but for some reason I couldn't find it in my thousands of emails this morning, literally.
[00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:11.559]  But I do want to thank a lot of the new affiliates that we've got out there.
[00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:15.481]  We are so appreciative of all of the stations that carry us.
[00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:22.124]  But AM 1340 is in Needles, Arizona, but it also goes into California.
[00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:25.027]  What, three states?
[00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:30.971]  So that's a great affiliate there, AM1340 out of Needles there in Arizona.
[00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:38.797]  And also in Montana, we have a new affiliate in, how do you pronounce it?
[00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:40.478]  Calasis, I believe.
[00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:44.000]  I'm going to make locals mad that I've even been through that town.
[00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:47.002]  And that's KGEZ AM600.
[00:10:47.102 --> 00:10:52.026]  And of course, Corpus Christi just turned us on.
[00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:53.798]  Several other stations.
[00:10:53.818 --> 00:10:54.478]  There's a whole bunch.
[00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:59.142]  It was seven stations like a week ago, and I haven't plugged any of them, and I apologize about that.
[00:10:59.462 --> 00:11:03.505]  So it's great to have more affiliates on board with us to really be growing.
[00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:12.692]  And again, I want to thank all the affiliates that have been carrying us in some cases as long as eight plus years since this broadcast went into syndication.
[00:11:14.292 --> 00:11:15.193]  Man, where to start?
[00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:17.617]  I mean, this is the kind of news that faces me every day.
[00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:23.444]  So before I start ranting about one subject, let me just go through the type of headlines that stare me down every day.
[00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:24.245]  Totally admit it.
[00:11:24.866 --> 00:11:25.127]  Okay?
[00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:32.531]  Women who eat GM foods while pregnant risk endangering their unborn babies, startling new research shows.
[00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:39.738]  And again, I've had the fathers on of DNA sequencing, the fathers of DNA coding and proteins.
[00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:48.585]  I mean, top individuals, top scientists who made major developments, who've gone public and said, I quit doing this, I quit being paid $20 million a year
[00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:53.935]  When we found that it's really killing all mammals that come in contact with it.
[00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.578]  Now I want you to understand something.
[00:11:55.618 --> 00:11:57.402]  This is on store shelves now.
[00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:15.370]  This is why everyone now has allergies, people who never had it have allergies, because then other pathogens in the air, other things that confuse the body, it makes you more susceptible, more easy to trigger when you're eating any of this GMO corn, when you're eating any of this GMO soy.
[00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:21.674]  There are literally, literally dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of studies
[00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:23.475]  That I have personally read.
[00:12:23.515 --> 00:12:25.415]  See folks, I set up late at night calmly.
[00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:27.636]  I'm actually a pretty calm person around the office.
[00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:31.077]  The people that go out to dinner with me, they're like, man, you're so calm, you know, in person.
[00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:33.078]  Why are you so upbeat on the air?
[00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:34.879]  Because then I get focused here.
[00:12:35.419 --> 00:12:39.260]  Then I, you know, get serious off of the, really it's frustration.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.140]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:41.901]  Last night I couldn't sleep.
[00:12:42.801 --> 00:12:47.283]  I was so angry about everything that's happening and so upset and so threatened.
[00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:52.291]  By all the incredibly bad things that are happening, and my desire to beat them.
[00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.432]  That even though I was exhausted, I couldn't go to bed.
[00:12:56.452 --> 00:12:59.113]  So I got up and I wrote a couple pages of notes.
[00:12:59.734 --> 00:13:05.556]  And then every time I try to articulate, just... The problem is, I can't even articulate how bad it is.
[00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:12.478]  Anything you can imagine, no matter how horrible it is, the governments of the Western world are openly doing it.
[00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:14.099]  I mean, literally.
[00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:16.160]  It is so diabolical.
[00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:25.363]  It is so massive, but let me just read to you, I'm sorry, see, I said that I'd just read the headlines and then I had to stop.
[00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:30.146]  GM, new study shows unborn babies could be harmed.
[00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:31.067]  London Independent.
[00:13:31.487 --> 00:13:37.812]  Mortality rate for newborn rats six times higher when mother was fed on diet of modified soy.
[00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:44.136]  And folks, this exact soy is in almost everything.
[00:13:44.196 --> 00:13:45.437]  I mean, processed foods.
[00:13:45.577 --> 00:13:46.578]  It is, read on the back.
[00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:52.149]  And because the GMO soy is the predominant variety now grown.
[00:13:52.169 --> 00:14:12.653]  Now there's a whole bunch of different varieties of that subdivision and we've again done massive shows on this with the farmers, the scientists, you name it, what it does and it's just right here and there's no debating it and think about how psychotic the government is and how nuts the big pharma is that they just do this.
[00:14:12.673 --> 00:14:16.094]  I had a New York Times article yesterday
[00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:17.814]  That we never even covered.
[00:14:17.874 --> 00:14:19.255]  I mentioned the headline, never covered it.
[00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:25.780]  About all these big studies coming out showing that genetically modified crops have spread into almost every species of plant.
[00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:33.286]  They're now killing whole fields, whole other species of plants that come in contact with them are now dying and losing their capacity to reproduce.
[00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:36.629]  And that's what the company said.
[00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:38.651]  I remember five years ago they had them on Santo.
[00:14:39.361 --> 00:14:52.532]  He gave a speech, and it's been in a bunch of newspapers, saying, our plan is to contaminate everything, then we own the courts, and the courts will say, since we contaminated you, that we really then own all other plant species.
[00:14:53.093 --> 00:15:02.221]  You ever seen that movie, The Thing, not the 1950s version, but the 1980s version, where The Thing takes over everything, but then looks like it?
[00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.270]  Okay?
[00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.151]  That is actually what a lot of these varieties do.
[00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:07.592]  Literally.
[00:15:08.012 --> 00:15:12.914]  It just doesn't happen in 30 seconds with spider legs popping out and pus squirting across the room.
[00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:15.194]  Okay?
[00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:22.957]  It just moves in and takes over, and then makes the plant inedible, or the plant stops reproducing, or it totally gets taken over.
[00:15:23.057 --> 00:15:26.819]  I mean, it is a cornucopia, literally, of evil.
[00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:27.619]  Pun intended.
[00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:32.839]  You see, I can't just read one article and then just move on to the next.
[00:15:32.979 --> 00:15:34.220]  It is killing us!
[00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:42.184]  But the phony environmental movement, financed by the same corporations doing this, they're too busy just stealing people's private property.
[00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:50.389]  And people get upset about the environment, they give money to the kid that comes to your door, they give money to fight for the environment locally, and it really goes to a big bank to steal your property.
[00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:51.530]  Public.
[00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.931]  I could do five shows on that and I have.
[00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:54.238]  Here's another one.
[00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:56.160]  Iran breaks seals at nuclear site.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.301]  Israel and U.S.
[00:15:57.341 --> 00:15:58.581]  said they could attack at any time.
[00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:00.243]  It could be tomorrow, it could be six months from now.
[00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:02.444]  And they're telling Turkey, get ready, we're going to attack them.
[00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:05.646]  We're going to use you as a military base.
[00:16:06.227 --> 00:16:09.689]  Young adults have healthy attitude towards privacy.
[00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:10.590]  This is a good news.
[00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:19.195]  Here they did a major poll that found that despite not growing up in the age of the KGB, a national poll of people 18 to 29, the majority do not like Big Brother.
[00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:21.657]  Well, I'd think so, but that's coming up later.
[00:16:21.877 --> 00:16:22.658]  That's some good news.
[00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.725]  Here's one Associated Press.
[00:16:24.805 --> 00:16:26.266]  Mexico demands U.S.
[00:16:26.306 --> 00:16:35.912]  allow more immigration and said migrants, regardless of their migratory status, should not be treated like criminals and demands a guest worker program, which is total legalization, Bush agrees.
[00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:40.795]  And then, remember we wrote the headline about six months ago about border war?
[00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:47.500]  Our headline was war zone, total breakdown of society, hundreds dead, rocket attacks?
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.901]  Finally, ABC News.
[00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:52.245]  But their answer is the Kest Worker Program.
[00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:53.245]  That will fix it.
[00:16:53.806 --> 00:16:56.727]  Drug War Zone rattles U.S.-Mexico border.
[00:16:57.327 --> 00:17:02.989]  And it says that it is an actual war zone, again, more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.631]  But of course, all their solutions are totally false.
[00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:07.751]  A U.S.
[00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:11.413]  troop sees award-winning Iraqi journalist who works for London Guardian.
[00:17:12.962 --> 00:17:15.805]  They have the nerve to get on the news and say there's free newspapers over there.
[00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:18.287]  Then it turns out they're all Pentagon fakes.
[00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:20.910]  No one is allowed to report anything.
[00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.474]  Before the war, the Pentagon said we will kill journalists that don't report what we say.
[00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:29.098]  And then it's a mystery when CNN goes, we think they're killing our reporters.
[00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:30.740]  Of course they are!
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:31.540]  U.S.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.722]  troops seize award-winning Iraqi journalists.
[00:17:33.983 --> 00:17:34.503]  Listen to this.
[00:17:34.563 --> 00:17:37.086]  Now folks, I have an audio clip of this.
[00:17:38.553 --> 00:17:40.834]  And I don't even know if I want to play it.
[00:17:41.355 --> 00:17:44.997]  Bush Adviser says President has legal power to torture children.
[00:17:45.017 --> 00:17:58.585]  And it says, John Yoo publicly argued that there is no law that could prevent the President from ordering the torture of a child of a suspected terrorist in custody, including by crushing that child's testicles.
[00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.847]  Now, I mean, folks, this is the real America.
[00:18:02.868 --> 00:18:06.850]  Now, we told you what was in the Washington Post, the CIA Section Chief bragged
[00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:08.829]  This makes my stomach turn.
[00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:21.399]  Bragged that they, and this was back in early 2002, that they were doing rendition and taking, quote, terrorist suspects to Egypt and Jordan where they tortured their children in front of them.
[00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:24.421]  I put that news article in Road to Tyranny.
[00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:27.543]  Remember back when I put that film out in 2002?
[00:18:27.944 --> 00:18:29.145]  Nobody even heard of torture.
[00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:30.346]  I even got calls and emails.
[00:18:30.606 --> 00:18:32.467]  Why are you talking about torture in your film?
[00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:32.908]  What?
[00:18:33.848 --> 00:18:35.850]  Then they were just preparing us to accept it.
[00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:42.570]  And man, they take those little kids in there, and the Army's Own Report admits, and they got these sicko jail guards, and they rape them.
[00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:43.931]  That's the Army's Own Report.
[00:18:44.152 --> 00:18:46.674]  Raping small children.
[00:18:47.434 --> 00:18:57.083]  And the sick thing is, then the Bush administration official, high level, gets up at a major university, and we have clips of it, in Chicago,
[00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:07.078]  A first debate in Chicago with Notre Dame professor and international human rights scholar Doug Cassel, we're going to get him on, and actually said that that is good.
[00:19:08.012 --> 00:19:10.154]  Now, you don't think he's just doing that on his own.
[00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:16.480]  No, they've been told to psychologically condition us and push the frontiers.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.025]  Folks, if they're saying, crushing children's testicles is good, what's coming next?
[00:19:22.085 --> 00:19:24.928]  I mean, God, what have we become?
[00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:27.791]  The Nazis didn't go this far.
[00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:31.234]  When Mengele tortured children, it was a hidden secret.
[00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:36.675]  And it was a secret when our government hired him and brought him over here through paperclip.
[00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:39.077]  Operation Paperclip and the Rat Line.
[00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:43.361]  And I just, I just feel dirty.
[00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:50.266]  I feel like I haven't done enough, I haven't fought enough, I haven't resisted these people enough.
[00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:52.808]  They all need to be arrested right now!
[00:19:52.928 --> 00:19:54.730]  George Bush and all of them!
[00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.713]  Just like Paul Craig Roberts says, they are worse than Nazis!
[00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:04.730]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:07.834]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:08.114 --> 00:20:12.259]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.541]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.841 --> 00:20:18.407]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.908 --> 00:20:21.009]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:36.213]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:21:02.484 --> 00:21:05.105]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:05.546 --> 00:21:17.851]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.393]  That way they will have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[00:21:23.254 --> 00:21:29.398]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:37.665]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:21:44.348 --> 00:21:46.029]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:46.569]  One and the same.
[00:22:08.522 --> 00:22:12.523]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:14.583]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:14.603 --> 00:22:15.103]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:16.644]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:17.404]  Here is reality.
[00:22:17.424 --> 00:22:19.844]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:19.884 --> 00:22:22.665]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:38.502 --> 00:22:42.266]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:10.569]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:14.191]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.273 --> 00:24:24.356]  Seriously, folks, we've got an audio clip we're going to play later where
[00:24:26.101 --> 00:24:37.109]  This Bush administration official, John Yoo, had written in presidential documents that if the president wanted to order things like this to be done to children, that he used the law, he could do it.
[00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:43.153]  So a professor brought this up to him, his quotes, and he said, yeah, the president wants to do that, he can.
[00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:49.197]  Folks, everybody knows, I don't care what the politicians say, that George Bush isn't allowed to say
[00:24:50.311 --> 00:24:58.018]  Drive down the street and decide he wants to walk into a liquor store and shoot the clerk behind the counter and then grab a bottle of Jack Daniels and run out the door.
[00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:00.040]  He isn't allowed to commit murder.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.803]  George Bush isn't allowed to snort cocaine.
[00:25:03.343 --> 00:25:07.928]  George Bush isn't allowed to violate the Constitution or he should be impeached.
[00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:10.165]  He is not above the law.
[00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:16.647]  In fact, government servants, public servants, they now call themselves officials and authorities.
[00:25:16.687 --> 00:25:18.287]  Never called that until about 20 years ago.
[00:25:18.787 --> 00:25:20.507]  They told you to call them that, see?
[00:25:20.947 --> 00:25:23.748]  That's how it is in Europe and China, where, oh, you're the official.
[00:25:24.028 --> 00:25:24.708]  Oh, sir!
[00:25:25.068 --> 00:25:25.908]  Oh, sir!
[00:25:26.589 --> 00:25:28.729]  And now it's happening here.
[00:25:29.969 --> 00:25:36.091]  Now it's going on in the United States of America, formerly Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.
[00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:38.071]  So that's the kind of news I've got here in front of me.
[00:25:39.139 --> 00:25:44.581]  Bush Advisor says President has legal power to torture children and crush their testicles in front of their parents.
[00:25:45.462 --> 00:25:51.584]  And they got all the 24 shows and shows like Spooks and every one of these shows they torture kids and it's always good.
[00:25:51.944 --> 00:25:53.345]  Torturing the kid gets the CC.
[00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:55.545]  It's not enough to condition you to accept torture.
[00:25:56.786 --> 00:25:59.847]  If they get you to accept torturing children, see, then you'll accept anything.
[00:26:00.687 --> 00:26:04.049]  But it was to get the, you know, the nuke deactivated and save the city.
[00:26:04.809 --> 00:26:07.030]  And of course that scenario will never happen.
[00:26:08.368 --> 00:26:15.003]  But it's to get you to play those little psychological games with yourself to move your compass.
[00:26:16.716 --> 00:26:26.725]  Leaked facts shows Romania helps CIA interrogators in torture on the Telegraph and Egyptian government facts intercepted by Swiss intelligence offers the first real evidence that the U.S.
[00:26:26.765 --> 00:26:31.970]  interrogated suspects terrorists at secret prisons in Eastern Europe, European politicians said yesterday.
[00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:42.479]  I always love how they act like it's so hard, but I guess for a journalist who's just now reporting on this like David Rennie for the London Telegraph, I guess it is hard.
[00:26:44.063 --> 00:26:46.445]  Because he wasn't following torture ten years ago.
[00:26:46.965 --> 00:26:48.226]  Okay?
[00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:50.347]  In 2002, they were in the Washington Post.
[00:26:50.387 --> 00:26:57.732]  The CIA said they were torturing children in Central Asia, in the Middle East, and in Europe.
[00:26:57.772 --> 00:26:59.953]  They were taking them to third-party countries for torture.
[00:27:00.613 --> 00:27:02.475]  They used the word torture.
[00:27:02.675 --> 00:27:03.455]  Torture.
[00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:06.017]  So everyone's looking for the first real proof.
[00:27:07.216 --> 00:27:15.621]  Again, it'd be like if somebody committed a crime, admitted to it, been found with the evidence, and then everyone's going, oh my gosh, we need evidence.
[00:27:17.542 --> 00:27:20.504]  The highly classified facts, which will probably turn out being fake.
[00:27:20.584 --> 00:27:23.706]  See, whenever something like this happens, it's usually what they call a honeypot.
[00:27:23.766 --> 00:27:25.467]  Disinfo to be disproven.
[00:27:26.507 --> 00:27:29.709]  Because I say that, because I don't think they're that stupid, all the media, to ignore.
[00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:32.331]  Back when they thought, right from 9-11, we'd buy anything.
[00:27:32.511 --> 00:27:34.592]  When they were going, yeah, we torture kids, yeah!
[00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:37.452]  I mean, now we have them!
[00:27:37.512 --> 00:27:38.735]  I mean, they're admitting it!
[00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:41.881]  It's like Dick Cheney in the P-9 document in September.
[00:27:42.868 --> 00:27:45.129]  20th 2000 says Saddam isn't a threat.
[00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:52.251]  He says Saddam is not a threat, but offers a pretext to invade and use Iraq as a central hub for the invasion of Iran and Syria.
[00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:54.492]  The oil supplies will also be quite lucrative.
[00:27:54.552 --> 00:27:55.892]  I mean, he says it!
[00:27:56.572 --> 00:27:58.853]  It's not like it's Bush's biographer saying it.
[00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:02.514]  It's not like it's Richard Clarke saying it or O'Neill saying it.
[00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:05.895]  Treasury Secretary, it is Dick Cheney!
[00:28:06.535 --> 00:28:07.756]  Dick Cheney!
[00:28:07.856 --> 00:28:08.876]  I have a little rap song.
[00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:11.550]  I mean, it's just, hey, Dick Cheney!
[00:28:12.051 --> 00:28:15.334]  I mean, I'll never... See, this is where my frustration comes from.
[00:28:15.635 --> 00:28:16.515]  It's all admitted.
[00:28:17.777 --> 00:28:20.720]  We're debating the NSA listening to foreign calls to the U.S.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.723]  from the NSA 20 years ago, and now they're listening to domestic U.S.
[00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:24.064]  calls.
[00:28:24.404 --> 00:28:25.445]  Declassified public.
[00:28:25.465 --> 00:28:27.127]  The media acts like they don't know about it.
[00:28:28.156 --> 00:28:33.820]  We sit here and we debate how they're listening to us when transponders are going in the cars nationwide to track our every movement.
[00:28:34.221 --> 00:28:36.382]  When you can call the cell phone company and say, where am I?
[00:28:36.402 --> 00:28:42.967]  And they'll tell you, well that's a federal operation and hooked into the NSA right now and about to be hooked into every major police department, every squad car!
[00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:50.152]  Your name, everything about you, where you're going, what you're doing, and the cop can punch a few keys and use your phone as a audio sensor.
[00:28:50.372 --> 00:28:51.573]  And you don't believe me on that.
[00:28:51.613 --> 00:28:52.374]  I remember when they put
[00:28:53.294 --> 00:28:54.255]  Microphones in.
[00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:56.616]  Five years ago in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:57.617]  No, six years ago.
[00:28:58.037 --> 00:29:00.158]  And it said, Gun Shot Detectors.
[00:29:00.178 --> 00:29:02.320]  Then I read the name of the company that had the microphones.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.923]  You go to their company, they brag about how they can listen to a kid on the street talking to his friend at 200 yards away.
[00:29:07.943 --> 00:29:09.504]  You can listen to the audio online.
[00:29:10.402 --> 00:29:13.585]  And I said, watch, when they're ready, they're going to announce them as microphones.
[00:29:13.665 --> 00:29:16.287]  And now, from Rochester, New York to Austin, Texas.
[00:29:16.827 --> 00:29:19.069]  See, they never went after one gunshot.
[00:29:19.089 --> 00:29:22.972]  They never went after any... They just quietly put them all in and just said, those are sketch gunshots.
[00:29:23.212 --> 00:29:25.494]  And now they're announcing, hey, we're going to be listening to you!
[00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:30.738]  And we're going to have the citizens able to dial into them and listen in hippas.
[00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:33.025]  In fact, I'm going to control myself.
[00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:34.706]  I promised myself to do this.
[00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:37.608]  Paul Watson's writing notes right now.
[00:29:38.128 --> 00:29:39.349]  Put a story together on this.
[00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:44.112]  I'm going to come back and go through the latest Big Brother developments calmly, if that's possible.
[00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:46.033]  Then we'll take your calls.
[00:29:46.073 --> 00:29:47.694]  Got two big guests coming up today.
[00:29:47.714 --> 00:29:48.534]  Stay with us!
[00:29:52.237 --> 00:29:53.137]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.618 --> 00:29:55.239]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.139 --> 00:29:58.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.061 --> 00:30:07.505]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:30:07.766 --> 00:30:11.369]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:19.637]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:30:19.897 --> 00:30:25.523]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:31.045]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:30:31.326 --> 00:30:33.406]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:30:33.667 --> 00:30:45.812]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:50.477]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:30:50.697 --> 00:30:51.659]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:53.461]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:30:53.581 --> 00:30:55.383]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:30:55.643 --> 00:30:56.104]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:30:56.144 --> 00:30:56.324]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:07.093]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:07.633]  are located?
[00:31:07.834 --> 00:31:11.217]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:11.437 --> 00:31:16.162]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:32:03.484 --> 00:32:09.845]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:15.066]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:15.386 --> 00:32:23.308]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:23.448 --> 00:32:30.489]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:30.709 --> 00:32:31.931]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:35.475]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:35.535 --> 00:32:36.636]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:36.937 --> 00:32:38.198]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:32:38.418 --> 00:32:45.247]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:45.367 --> 00:32:47.810]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:51.732]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:51.792 --> 00:32:55.415]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.248 --> 00:33:25.945]  It was a Fort Worth police officer gave me this about, not about, six and a half years ago up in Waco.
[00:33:26.005 --> 00:33:29.110]  We were building a memorial church for all those that died up there, a chapel.
[00:33:30.749 --> 00:33:32.269]  And it's an old painting.
[00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:33.430]  It's a print of a painting.
[00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:39.831]  No man in the wrong can stand up against a fella that is in the right and keeps on a coming.
[00:33:39.871 --> 00:33:41.892]  Texas Ranger Captain Bill McDonald.
[00:33:42.332 --> 00:33:42.872]  And that's true.
[00:33:42.972 --> 00:33:49.954]  No man in the wrong can stand up against a fella that is in the right and keeps on a coming.
[00:33:51.414 --> 00:33:52.134]  And that's the key.
[00:33:52.214 --> 00:33:54.215]  We Americans were known for standing up.
[00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:55.335]  We started laying down.
[00:33:56.838 --> 00:33:59.100]  And I just get so angry.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.101]  I keep saying that.
[00:34:00.221 --> 00:34:02.202]  I am so... It feels good, though.
[00:34:02.242 --> 00:34:04.244]  I mean, this is what I felt like six, seven, eight years ago.
[00:34:04.264 --> 00:34:06.646]  And over time, I just kind of got conditioned.
[00:34:06.686 --> 00:34:21.537]  I would still get angry some, but I am just energized because now so many people are waking up, but at the same time, the enemy, the New World Order, these criminals that control our government, have just pulled out all of the stops.
[00:34:22.606 --> 00:34:27.408]  Oh, by the way, here are some of the commuter stations that we've signed up in the last week and a half that I wanted to thank.
[00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:39.414]  KTOX AM 1340, and that is in Needles, and the Mojave Valley, Bullhead City, and Lake Hanasu City.
[00:34:40.435 --> 00:34:42.536]  And, of course, KGEZ AM 600, and that is in Talispel.
[00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:57.819]  And Poulsen, and we're really excited about that, and KCLT AM, and that's in Corpus Christi, Texas, 1150 AM.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:07.046]  And there's a whole bunch of other stations I need to get the information on so I can plug them, because that's something I really, again, don't do enough, and I want to thank all of those new stations.
[00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:11.310]  We need to get also an updated list on the website, there's so many.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.423]  Four folks that can specifically tune in and listen to the show.
[00:35:15.923 --> 00:35:23.169]  I guarantee you we've got listeners in listening areas that are listening on the internet or shortwave or satellite that don't even know they can pick us up when I am in FM.
[00:35:23.689 --> 00:35:27.733]  I mean, what have we got, like, four affiliates now in Illinois about to get a fifth?
[00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:31.296]  We've got three affiliates in Ohio about to get a fourth.
[00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:38.682]  My point is, places that we weren't even on in the past, we're really starting to build in.
[00:35:39.082 --> 00:35:41.444]  In my own state of Texas, though, only on a few stations.
[00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:48.100]  And frankly, it's because most people down here, at least some of them, just they don't care if Bush wants their guns.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.321]  They've been told that's conservative and they're ready to hand them in.
[00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:52.001]  And I'm not kidding about it.
[00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:54.362]  I've had them tell me, you're one of those right-wing conservatives.
[00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:56.323]  Why, I'm for gun control.
[00:35:56.343 --> 00:35:58.344]  And I'm just like, well, you just enjoy yourself then.
[00:35:59.984 --> 00:36:01.305]  Please go from us in peace.
[00:36:01.865 --> 00:36:09.968]  Forget that we were ever your countrymen and may your chains sit lightly upon you and crouch and lick the hand that feeds you.
[00:36:12.142 --> 00:36:17.945]  I'm paraphrasing one of those old, dead, white guys, but it makes my top blow.
[00:36:18.245 --> 00:36:32.552]  I mean, when I see a high-level Bush administration official, and by the way, get that clip ready, and this isn't the best audio, it was recorded up in Chicago at one of these big university debates where they, of course, never allow cameras and videotape to be there, but somebody did catch it on video, and this is
[00:36:33.951 --> 00:36:39.674]  This is audio off the video of John Yoo, who worked high level in the Bush administration.
[00:36:39.694 --> 00:36:40.634]  Let me just read part of this.
[00:36:40.954 --> 00:36:45.437]  Bush advisor says president has legal power to torture children.
[00:36:45.977 --> 00:36:58.523]  John Yoo publicly argued that there is no law that could prevent the president from ordering the torture of a child of a suspect in custody, including by crushing that child's testicles.
[00:36:59.495 --> 00:37:08.308]  And this came out in response to a question in the December 1st debate in Chicago with a Notre Dame professor and international human rights scholar, Doug, at Council.
[00:37:08.729 --> 00:37:10.231]  I'm going to try to get both these guys on.
[00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:12.334]  What is particularly chilling
[00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:22.700]  And revealing about this is that John Yoo was a key architect post 9-1-1 Bush administration legal policy and a deputy assistant to the then Attorney General John Ashcroft.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:34.831]  John Yoo authored a number of legal memos arguing for unlimited presidential powers to order torture of captive suspects and to declare war anytime, anywhere on anyone the President deemed a threat.
[00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:43.976]  It has now come out that you also had a hand in providing legal reasoning for the President to conduct unauthorized wiretaps of U.S.
[00:37:44.017 --> 00:37:54.483]  citizens, Georgetown Law Professor David Cole wrote, Few lawyers have had more influence on President Bush's legal policies and the war on terror than John Yoo was one of his counsels.
[00:37:54.823 --> 00:37:59.086]  So was Alberto Gonzalez who said the President is law and we can torture people to death.
[00:37:59.106 --> 00:37:59.526]  Remember that?
[00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:00.827]  Those four memos are public.
[00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:09.973]  This part of the exchange during the debate with Doug Castle reveals the logic of Hughes' theories adopted by the administration as bedrock principles in the real world.
[00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:17.776]  Castle, if the President deems that he's got to torture somebody, including by crushing the testicles of a person's child, there is no law that could stop him?
[00:38:18.076 --> 00:38:18.376]  You.
[00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:18.996]  No treaty.
[00:38:19.476 --> 00:38:21.797]  Also, no law by Congress, Castle said.
[00:38:22.117 --> 00:38:25.078]  That is what you wrote in August 2002 memo of the President.
[00:38:25.398 --> 00:38:25.638]  You.
[00:38:25.778 --> 00:38:28.919]  I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.360]  He goes on that yes, he can.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:38.404]  You reasoned that because the Constitution makes the President the Commander-in-Chief, no law can restrict the actions he may take in pursuit of war.
[00:38:38.904 --> 00:38:44.428]  On this reasoning, the President would be entitled by the Constitution to resort to genocide if he wished.
[00:38:44.508 --> 00:38:46.889]  Folks, that is an actual quote right there.
[00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:48.290]  Oh, genocide!
[00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.251]  Oh, yeah!
[00:38:50.271 --> 00:38:54.473]  I guess he did fund Hitler, as granted he did, and their main money, their family, publicly.
[00:38:54.493 --> 00:38:56.074]  The New York Times is from the Hitlers.
[00:38:56.654 --> 00:39:04.077]  So, let's be honest, Fritz Giesen, the man that paid Hitler, the main industrialist, go ahead and roll this sicko.
[00:39:05.398 --> 00:39:15.363]  If the President deems that he's got to torture somebody, including by crushing the testicles of the person's child, there is no law that can stop that.
[00:39:16.323 --> 00:39:16.743]  No treaty.
[00:39:16.823 --> 00:39:18.244]  And also no law by Congress.
[00:39:18.264 --> 00:39:20.285]  That's what you wrote in the August 2002 memo.
[00:39:20.365 --> 00:39:22.846]  I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that.
[00:39:26.068 --> 00:39:30.689]  And then if you want to go to the website, you can link to another site that has more of it where he gets into the genocide and stuff.
[00:39:31.889 --> 00:39:33.190]  Folks, let me explain something again.
[00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:38.051]  The president, Joseph Mingala, and this is well documented.
[00:39:38.871 --> 00:39:50.674]  In fact, one of my counterparts, the guy's dead now, even interviewed the German driver, this was not part of some Soviet propaganda, this is true, who actually drove Mingala with five kids in a car.
[00:39:50.694 --> 00:39:52.514]  And he'd do this every few weeks, it was just an enjoyment.
[00:39:53.368 --> 00:39:55.049]  You know, some people like to go fly fishing.
[00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:56.349]  Some people like to go hiking.
[00:39:56.369 --> 00:39:57.710]  Some people like white water rafting.
[00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:58.770]  Some people like to go play pool.
[00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.611]  Some people like to blow little kids' heads off.
[00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.431]  You know, Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:03.212]  People like that like to kill them other ways.
[00:40:03.852 --> 00:40:07.774]  And Mingala, Joseph Mingala, who was later protected by the U.S.
[00:40:07.814 --> 00:40:08.494]  government publicly.
[00:40:09.094 --> 00:40:10.975]  That's public, just like Wernher von Braun and the rest of them.
[00:40:11.555 --> 00:40:15.237]  Wernher von Braun Space Center, high schools, colleges named after him.
[00:40:15.257 --> 00:40:16.077]  Of course, it's not true.
[00:40:16.257 --> 00:40:16.737]  I know!
[00:40:16.817 --> 00:40:17.218]  It's not true.
[00:40:17.278 --> 00:40:17.818]  Everything's fine.
[00:40:19.058 --> 00:40:20.119]  Go back to Sleep America.
[00:40:20.699 --> 00:40:22.920]  He would march the five little kids out.
[00:40:23.817 --> 00:40:26.058]  Sometimes six little kids, as many as they could pack in the big car.
[00:40:26.478 --> 00:40:28.759]  He'd hand them chocolates on the side of the road.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:40.785]  And, uh, they would eat the chocolates, and he would ask them if they were good, and then he would just, uh, get a gleeful look on his face with his luger, and he would blow their little heads off.
[00:40:43.286 --> 00:40:52.570]  Now, uh, thousands of these characters, some not as vicious as Mingela, some more vicious, were brought to the United States.
[00:40:53.447 --> 00:40:55.609]  Of course, Mengele's family were the equivalent of billionaires.
[00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:58.371]  And so he was taken care of quite nicely.
[00:40:58.411 --> 00:41:00.993]  He lived in the U.S., out in Midland, Texas for a while.
[00:41:01.973 --> 00:41:07.758]  Then he had to run away because there was a few Jewish groups that couldn't be bought off, wouldn't go along with it, so he had to run down to Brazil.
[00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:09.219]  But that's just public.
[00:41:09.259 --> 00:41:10.200]  That's public knowledge.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.400]  Your government took him.
[00:41:12.501 --> 00:41:19.306]  And he'd take twins and sew them together, cut kids' eyeballs out, or he'd tie a woman's legs together when she was going to give birth.
[00:41:19.326 --> 00:41:20.047]  I mean, you want to hear more?
[00:41:21.217 --> 00:41:22.139]  You don't have to now.
[00:41:22.159 --> 00:41:30.395]  You can just hear the White House counsel saying, genocide's good, crushing testicles is good, torturing children's good, and we can do whatever we want.
[00:41:33.451 --> 00:41:34.651]  And that is tyranny, folks.
[00:41:34.691 --> 00:41:40.292]  They got the guns, they got the fighter bombers, they got the mindless cops to follow the orders and think this is part of some good country.
[00:41:40.613 --> 00:41:43.353]  The people running America are killing America.
[00:41:43.753 --> 00:41:53.775]  And they got all this moral authority baloney of why they do it and all these public relations ads and all these public service commercials about why the government loves you and how they're doing this for you.
[00:41:53.935 --> 00:41:57.776]  And they do a lot of good things, on purpose, on the surface, to make you think it's okay.
[00:41:58.036 --> 00:42:00.637]  While they carry out their real operations behind the scenes.
[00:42:00.877 --> 00:42:02.437]  And even when it's a good thing they're doing.
[00:42:02.877 --> 00:42:04.479]  Like, I'm all for trauma centers.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.001]  More trauma centers in Texas.
[00:42:07.042 --> 00:42:14.089]  But we wouldn't need more money if we weren't being bankrupted by the conservatively 9 million illegal aliens in Texas.
[00:42:15.043 --> 00:42:16.323]  Yes, folks, 9 million.
[00:42:16.343 --> 00:42:17.724]  Supposedly we're only 25 million people.
[00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:18.744]  You go, what do you mean 9 million?
[00:42:20.085 --> 00:42:23.146]  The government says 6 million, and anything they say is at least twice as much.
[00:42:23.426 --> 00:42:24.886]  But I'm even cutting that down.
[00:42:24.906 --> 00:42:28.247]  9 million is one of the internal government numbers that we've seen in some documents.
[00:42:29.067 --> 00:42:31.108]  9 million, and that was 2004 numbers.
[00:42:31.668 --> 00:42:35.009]  They come out a year late, and I saw those a few months ago, so I'm sure it's worse now.
[00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:39.971]  9 million illegal aliens getting free health care that you and I pay for.
[00:42:40.828 --> 00:42:45.692]  Now, that is in the tune of around $10 billion a year.
[00:42:46.152 --> 00:42:48.955]  California, it's around $20 billion a year or more.
[00:42:48.975 --> 00:42:50.156]  That's not counting corrections.
[00:42:50.536 --> 00:42:53.238]  About 40% of their population is illegal aliens out in California.
[00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:57.822]  So instead of doing something about that, we say our trauma hospitals are overloaded.
[00:42:59.463 --> 00:43:03.506]  So when that stupid DPS cop, I shouldn't say stupid, ignorant, probably a smart guy.
[00:43:05.628 --> 00:43:10.212]  So when he pulls me over, and he pulls me over,
[00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:16.604]  And he tells me I'm gonna get points on my driver's license if I'm convicted of this latest speeding thing when I wasn't speeding.
[00:43:16.624 --> 00:43:17.705]  If I'm speeding, I'll admit it.
[00:43:18.085 --> 00:43:19.165]  I admitted it last time on air.
[00:43:21.146 --> 00:43:22.846]  That, uh, I'm gonna have to pay big money.
[00:43:24.326 --> 00:43:28.007]  And, but it's okay, he's smirking, cause it pays for hospitals.
[00:43:28.227 --> 00:43:32.449]  And then, of course, I went and looked it up and found news articles where they're not giving the money to hospitals to begin with.
[00:43:32.689 --> 00:43:34.189]  Oh, but it sounded real good, didn't it?
[00:43:35.189 --> 00:43:38.050]  And by the way, you're going to end up losing your job, mister!
[00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:47.313]  That's also part of the plan, but you're too lazy to go read the documents and what the State Board of Transportation is admitting we're moving towards under federal grants.
[00:43:47.493 --> 00:43:52.174]  By the way, the feds will give you 20 million bucks and then expect billions in revenue off of it.
[00:43:52.394 --> 00:43:54.215]  This isn't free federal money to begin with.
[00:43:54.395 --> 00:43:58.696]  They take it, send 30 cents back, and then mandate 20 times that much spending back on us.
[00:43:59.277 --> 00:44:00.637]  It's just all a scam!
[00:44:01.017 --> 00:44:03.218]  Man, we're getting scammed every which way but loose!
[00:44:07.282 --> 00:44:14.987]  Now, I know Paul Watson's listening patiently, and he wanted to hear my specific rant on Big Brother, so that he could write an article about it.
[00:44:15.967 --> 00:44:18.129]  And listen up, then, my compadre.
[00:44:18.329 --> 00:44:18.989]  This is how we do it.
[00:44:19.049 --> 00:44:20.630]  I'll rant on air about the information.
[00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:25.473]  He will then compile my comments, and of course find hyperlinks to every statement I make, because they're all documented.
[00:44:25.493 --> 00:44:27.194]  He does a great job.
[00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:28.095]  He does the real work.
[00:44:28.215 --> 00:44:31.657]  And then Paul will add his points to it, and that's when you see an Alex Jones-Paul Watson article.
[00:44:31.677 --> 00:44:32.257]  That's what happened.
[00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:36.560]  Let me just settle down for a minute.
[00:44:39.278 --> 00:44:40.379]  Let me just settle down for a minute.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.903]  I have these articles here in my stack.
[00:44:50.003 --> 00:44:51.244]  Let me just read this to you.
[00:44:51.284 --> 00:44:52.704]  This isn't Alex Jones writing this.
[00:44:52.724 --> 00:44:54.265]  This is the BBC, okay?
[00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.066]  This is the BBC.
[00:44:57.006 --> 00:44:59.748]  Rights Group criticizes AsaboTV.
[00:45:00.168 --> 00:45:00.568]  Comment.
[00:45:01.545 --> 00:45:23.969]  This, combined with the government's encouragement for Londoners to report their neighbors for suspicious activity, including dropping bubble gum, of which potential signs of terrorism include owning a vehicle, living in a house, or getting a refund on a credit card, fuse the infrastructure of the classic total surveillance state with civilian tattletale squads forming the modern Stasi.
[00:45:26.209 --> 00:45:30.610]  And then, this is what the article says, civil rights campaigners have voiced concern about a new channel
[00:45:31.346 --> 00:45:38.190]  Allowing householders in East London to monitor local CCTV cameras dubbed SaboTV.
[00:45:39.251 --> 00:45:46.815]  The project will enable residents to compare suspicious characters with an on-screen rogues gallery from their living rooms.
[00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:50.437]  Viewers can then alert police to anyone in a breach of anti-social behavior.
[00:45:52.117 --> 00:45:53.458]  Or committing a crime.
[00:45:53.858 --> 00:45:57.841]  A Sabo Concern said the scheme was a gimmick and would be open to abuse.
[00:45:58.341 --> 00:45:59.141]  Fear of crime.
[00:45:59.181 --> 00:46:06.726]  And it goes on to say that the CCTV channel is part of a 12 million pound or 24 million dollar... That's not true.
[00:46:06.746 --> 00:46:09.708]  12 million pounds is about 22 million.
[00:46:09.868 --> 00:46:10.789]  Okay.
[00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:19.054]  22 million community network project being set up in the area under a 10-year government-funded reg... Whatever that says.
[00:46:20.027 --> 00:46:20.968]  We're good to go.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.240]  We're good to go.
[00:46:55.097 --> 00:47:15.343]  Either over your computer or over your cable system, they will put it in, and for your public service, for tickets or anything else, this is responsibility, you will have to watch, starting at two hours a week, if you wish to be paid upwards of twenty hours a week, this will be the new job in America, sitting there watching for terrorism, but then it said, yeah, there isn't much terrorism, so we'll also be watching for crime.
[00:47:15.683 --> 00:47:20.264]  You see, because they can't, they've tried to develop computers that are AI, artificially intelligent,
[00:47:21.358 --> 00:47:26.042]  They pick up stuff and they claim they have biometric stuff that can tell if you're a terrorist because of how you walk.
[00:47:26.562 --> 00:47:27.163]  Just type that in.
[00:47:27.803 --> 00:47:29.284]  They can tell you're a terrorist by how you walk.
[00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:30.325]  You'll get probably 50 articles.
[00:47:30.645 --> 00:47:31.506]  No, you'll get about 500.
[00:47:31.546 --> 00:47:31.946]  I'm sorry.
[00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:33.727]  Really, there's hundreds I've seen.
[00:47:34.608 --> 00:47:37.090]  And so, all of this is going on, just literally.
[00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:42.414]  You see, I just said I was going to go over this, and I'm just covering one point and ranting about it.
[00:47:43.134 --> 00:47:43.735]  Number one.
[00:47:45.116 --> 00:47:50.480]  The government has been caught using chemical and biological and radiological weapons on the American people and the British people.
[00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:53.956]  Thousands of times declassified.
[00:47:53.976 --> 00:47:55.719]  They cannot be trusted to do anything.
[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.840]  They have no moral authority.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.266]  Then, statistically, governments have been found to engage in more criminal activity.
[00:48:01.444 --> 00:48:03.105]  Then the general member of the public.
[00:48:03.325 --> 00:48:04.946]  So again, they have no moral authority.
[00:48:05.227 --> 00:48:08.208]  It is not because we have something to hide that we don't want this.
[00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:20.656]  It's because we don't trust the government because all history and common sense shows that they do this to literally enslave you and abuse you because there's corrupt people that want more power and control.
[00:48:20.876 --> 00:48:30.482]  And high-level dictators will put in thousands of viceroys and minions who will all set up their own little petty empires in your neighborhood and make your life a living hell!
[00:48:32.213 --> 00:48:33.334]  Okay, that's point number one.
[00:48:34.874 --> 00:48:44.919]  This is a total control grid, not so they can just have it in place, but so they can abuse us even further, and the more we put up with, even more control will be layered onto that.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:53.523]  This control grid is so they can enforce, force psychological testing and drugging, now a federal law to be done nationwide,
[00:48:54.472 --> 00:48:58.993]  Under New Freedom, it is so they can enforce a conscription, that is the national draft.
[00:48:59.033 --> 00:49:03.894]  It's so they can enforce their land takings that are going to happen under zoning.
[00:49:03.914 --> 00:49:07.215]  They're just openly taking private property without even just compensation now.
[00:49:07.415 --> 00:49:09.015]  Again, all the indicators, folks!
[00:49:09.856 --> 00:49:11.376]  You see, I'm just seeing this even clearer now.
[00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:14.517]  This is happening faster than I personally thought it would happen.
[00:49:16.177 --> 00:49:18.578]  Number three, they did not ask us.
[00:49:19.258 --> 00:49:20.058]  You know, they claim
[00:49:21.247 --> 00:49:22.650]  They put it all in place first.
[00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.278]  They were putting radio readers up eight years ago in Texas.
[00:49:26.639 --> 00:49:32.411]  I saw an article six years ago in Indiana where they were putting up license plate readers and now they're going in nationwide.
[00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:39.255]  Remember three years ago, the little Florida town, quote, everyone that goes through it has their, quote, records run?
[00:49:39.495 --> 00:49:40.795]  That's already gone in nationwide.
[00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:43.076]  But they're now announcing that in England.
[00:49:43.276 --> 00:49:45.376]  Here they put it in place and then announce it.
[00:49:45.736 --> 00:49:49.157]  Notice they put the cameras in first and said, oh, it's just for traffic, shut up.
[00:49:49.698 --> 00:49:52.178]  And I told you they then announced, oh, the cops are going to use it.
[00:49:52.338 --> 00:49:53.259]  That was always the plan.
[00:49:53.479 --> 00:49:54.479]  See, now that's happening.
[00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:56.991]  So they did not ask us.
[00:49:57.051 --> 00:50:03.173]  Then, retroactively, when we do hear about it, there's polls in 85, 95, 98, depending on the poll.
[00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:05.794]  I mean, almost everyone's against it, and they just don't care.
[00:50:06.054 --> 00:50:06.814]  It's like Texas.
[00:50:07.094 --> 00:50:10.515]  We beat the RFID tracker chip in the inspection sticker.
[00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:13.916]  And what does the DPS do with the TxDOT?
[00:50:14.236 --> 00:50:18.497]  They announce they're going to put at least 2 million of them in this year without even asking.
[00:50:19.654 --> 00:50:21.395]  So, you're criminals!
[00:50:22.476 --> 00:50:23.957]  I mean, you are criminals!
[00:50:24.157 --> 00:50:25.878]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it!
[00:50:26.218 --> 00:50:27.819]  You all deserve to go to prison!
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.721]  Any of you that do this stuff!
[00:50:32.182 --> 00:50:33.583]  I got 20 points here.
[00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:39.907]  I said I'd be calm about this, but it's just, I've gotta, it's just, there's so much here.
[00:50:43.189 --> 00:50:44.030]  I'm gonna go through all of it.
[00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:46.631]  We got a big guest coming up.
[00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:48.533]  I know we got callers, but you may not even get on.
[00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:51.471]  Until later, because I've just got to cover all this.
[00:50:52.332 --> 00:50:53.354]  I've got to plug videos.
[00:50:53.374 --> 00:50:54.976]  I've got to plug those or we won't even be here.

[00:51:03.317 --> 00:51:06.179]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:51:18.229 --> 00:51:22.432]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.

[00:51:25.575 --> 00:51:28.037]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:28.257 --> 00:51:34.801]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:42.285]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:54:08.459 --> 00:54:12.461]  I don't mean to start hyperventilating.
[00:54:12.821 --> 00:54:15.303]  I didn't mean to sit there and bash the state police yesterday.
[00:54:15.343 --> 00:54:17.004]  I had a really bad car wreck with my dad.
[00:54:18.027 --> 00:54:18.488]  We're good to go.
[00:54:38.763 --> 00:54:41.325]  And you know, I've had them pull me over and not give me tickets when I have been speeding.
[00:54:41.525 --> 00:54:43.947]  The point is, I wasn't speeding this time, and the guy gave me a ticket.
[00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:45.309]  And that isn't what made me mad.
[00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:47.811]  It was the search the car business.
[00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:51.654]  It was the, where you coming from, where you been, you know, all this.
[00:54:51.774 --> 00:54:52.935]  I just don't need it, man.
[00:54:52.995 --> 00:54:54.516]  I'm a free human being.
[00:54:54.536 --> 00:55:00.241]  And then you give me something about a point system, and I go research it, and it's criminal!
[00:55:02.993 --> 00:55:04.474]  It's just, it's all a scam.
[00:55:04.774 --> 00:55:07.835]  And then the cops all think it's for hospitals, and it's not for hospitals.
[00:55:08.255 --> 00:55:10.236]  It actually goes to a private Spanish company.
[00:55:10.256 --> 00:55:11.917]  49% of it.
[00:55:11.937 --> 00:55:16.058]  And then of the 49% that's supposed to go, 1% goes to the DPS.
[00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:16.939]  Isn't that ridiculous?
[00:55:17.319 --> 00:55:24.402]  I mean, just... Of the 49% that's supposed to go to the hospitals, what'd they say, about 12% of that's going?
[00:55:25.362 --> 00:55:28.303]  And it said it's illegal, but just, well, no one's going to stop them.
[00:55:28.343 --> 00:55:29.484]  It's just going to something else.
[00:55:32.319 --> 00:55:34.861]  It's just the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:55:34.881 --> 00:55:40.764]  They got all these good little reasons of why they do is to con us and condition us that it's all wonderful.
[00:55:40.784 --> 00:55:43.045]  What were the other points I made?
[00:55:44.425 --> 00:55:47.107]  GPS in the cars for taxation regulation.
[00:55:47.587 --> 00:55:48.427]  The cell phones.
[00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:50.988]  Call up with your cell phone and tell them, where am I?
[00:55:51.089 --> 00:55:52.889]  And they'll tell you down to a few feet where you're at.
[00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.731]  Well, the government's using that same system going in the emergency management systems.
[00:55:57.051 --> 00:56:02.294]  The exact same transponder systems are going in England, the U.S., Germany, and Western Europe, showing it's global.
[00:56:04.984 --> 00:56:08.807]  They're watching what you watch on your cable boxes, your digital cable boxes in TiVo.
[00:56:09.088 --> 00:56:13.731]  Track exactly what you watch, how long you watch it, and what your psychological score is.
[00:56:14.272 --> 00:56:17.514]  You know those 600 question psychologicals they give you at some jobs?
[00:56:18.095 --> 00:56:18.655]  Police get them.
[00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:19.456]  You've had them.
[00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:24.020]  Well, imagine having millions of your choices over the years on computers and on cable.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.362]  They can really build a digital algorithm with that.
[00:56:27.943 --> 00:56:31.566]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:56:31.626 --> 00:56:33.828]  It's all totally un-American.
[00:56:35.251 --> 00:56:38.792]  And it's systematic.
[00:56:38.832 --> 00:56:40.252]  They've built the cage around us.
[00:56:40.633 --> 00:56:42.073]  Now they're starting to turn it on.
[00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:46.234]  And you've got all these happy Americans who grew up in this free country, this wonderland.
[00:56:47.755 --> 00:56:50.695]  And the government's openly announced that they're doing all of this.
[00:56:51.116 --> 00:56:56.977]  So when they take your pension funds, which is already starting to happen, because the dollar's going down in value, that automatically happens.
[00:56:57.297 --> 00:57:03.279]  So when they take your private property, which they're now announcing they're going to do, under federal zoning at the local level,
[00:57:04.139 --> 00:57:05.920]  That you won't be able to resist.
[00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:08.642]  I mean, they say they're going to do all these bad things.
[00:57:11.184 --> 00:57:12.385]  It's so horrible.
[00:57:12.425 --> 00:57:14.247]  I mean, we're not just going to be a police state, folks.
[00:57:14.287 --> 00:57:16.588]  We're going to be the biggest one the world's ever seen.
[00:57:16.768 --> 00:57:17.889]  America, bigger and better.
[00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.292]  In my own state, we always do it bigger in Texas.
[00:57:21.352 --> 00:57:25.194]  And boy, yeah, Texas is going to be one of the worst states in the Union.
[00:57:25.214 --> 00:57:26.996]  It's just so sad to me.
[00:57:27.896 --> 00:57:29.538]  My family, again, has deep roots here.
[00:57:29.598 --> 00:57:31.319]  I was out on the family home place this weekend.
[00:57:32.416 --> 00:57:36.878]  And you know, out there with old homesteads and old rock-lined wells, you know, built in the 1830s.
[00:57:37.738 --> 00:57:40.979]  And just out there thinking about how free we used to be and we're not going to be.
[00:57:41.339 --> 00:57:46.581]  It just makes me sad to know that at once free people are totally being enslaved and don't even know what's going on.
[00:57:48.801 --> 00:57:50.462]  Listen, before I end this hour,
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.500]  We've still got a lot of specials.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.481]  We've got some new specials we're now offering.
[00:57:54.801 --> 00:57:55.761]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:57:56.061 --> 00:58:04.322]  We got rid of the old specials and are offering a lot of new specials at Infowars.com on our books and videos and books on tape and t-shirts that we carry.
[00:58:04.342 --> 00:58:06.443]  We kept a few of the old specials and added a bunch of new ones.

[00:59:03.188 --> 00:59:04.008]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.728 --> 00:59:06.269]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:10.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.491 --> 00:59:14.612]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.692 --> 00:59:27.817]  Well, a high-level Bush administration official, authority, master ruler of the people, has written in memos that Bush is above the law and that they can torture children, genocide,
[00:59:29.204 --> 00:59:35.226]  They can crush children's body parts in front of their parents to, quote, make them talk.
[00:59:35.246 --> 00:59:36.526]  You know, that's what the good guys do.
[00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:38.707]  That's how sick all of this has gotten.
[00:59:39.367 --> 00:59:45.749]  And I went through the control grid, how systematically, the government didn't ask us, and when we told them we didn't want it, they said, we don't care.
[00:59:46.209 --> 00:59:52.370]  Put up the radio scanner readers for the RFID chips going on the inspection stickers and the registration stickers nationwide.
[00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:56.451]  Even when we beat laws at the state level, they just still implement it.
[00:59:56.531 --> 00:59:58.452]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:59:59.922 --> 01:00:05.945]  They are tracking us with the computers, tracking us with the digital cable boxes, selling the data.
[01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:10.427]  Companies are openly selling your personal data, selling your cell phone records to whoever wants them.
[01:00:11.188 --> 01:00:13.569]  And all this was federally put in by the federal government.
[01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:18.171]  The British government is going to sell all the National ID card data to whoever wants it.
[01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:22.353]  They're putting into cable systems here in the U.S.
[01:00:22.373 --> 01:00:23.033]  They're planning it.
[01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.154]  It's now starting in England.
[01:00:25.046 --> 01:00:37.049]  To have whole cable channels that are interactive where you can flip to any of thousands of cameras you want and zoom in and watch people and report it to the cops and have a gallery of even petty criminals and call the police for people.
[01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:38.169]  They have these new laws.
[01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:38.890]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:47.012]  They have these new laws where you go to jail if you drop litter, but then they can also take your house if you drop litter.
[01:00:47.772 --> 01:00:49.592]  So, see, that's a police state, folks.
[01:00:50.373 --> 01:00:50.933]  Well, that's like
[01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:54.398]  I'm having one of those moments.
[01:00:54.438 --> 01:00:55.379]  What's the big island?
[01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:56.079]  Singapore.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:57.981]  The Singapore.
[01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.984]  It's been on television where a guy doesn't wash his hands in the bathroom.
[01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.705]  Camera in the bathroom on national U.S.
[01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:03.145]  television.
[01:01:03.366 --> 01:01:05.327]  They're showing this on ABC News a few years ago.
[01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:06.448]  Caller called in about it.
[01:01:06.488 --> 01:01:07.389]  I have seen that footage.
[01:01:07.769 --> 01:01:08.490]  And he walks out.
[01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.671]  He's arrested by police.
[01:01:10.592 --> 01:01:11.773]  Didn't wash his hands well.
[01:01:11.813 --> 01:01:12.834]  It'll keep us safe.
[01:01:13.294 --> 01:01:14.455]  You know, what costs safe?
[01:01:15.015 --> 01:01:16.757]  Of course, the globalists are moving everything there.
[01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:17.798]  That's going to be their headquarters.
[01:01:18.198 --> 01:01:19.199]  One of their major headquarters.
[01:01:19.239 --> 01:01:20.400]  Just a hellish world.
[01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:26.923]  And now all over the U.S., cameras in restrooms, at the rest stops, cameras in school bathrooms, in the stalls.
[01:01:27.443 --> 01:01:29.764]  Oh yeah, Paul Watson, add that to the article you're putting together.
[01:01:30.024 --> 01:01:31.364]  Cameras in the bathrooms.
[01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:35.626]  I mean, you know, just, there's no end to it.
[01:01:35.686 --> 01:01:37.346]  It's all off the charts.
[01:01:38.807 --> 01:01:40.047]  And the average American
[01:01:40.752 --> 01:01:45.736]  is totally unaware of the fact that any of this is even going on.
[01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:57.865]  Meanwhile, the government's own documents come out that mercury in the vaccines has brain-damaged millions, and the CDC's own documents got released by Dan Burton's committees, and they say, yeah, it's brain-damaged millions, we gotta cover this up, but I'm not giving it to my kids.
[01:01:58.205 --> 01:01:59.666]  The director actually says that in the meeting.
[01:01:59.686 --> 01:02:00.847]  I'm not giving it to my granddaughter.
[01:02:02.288 --> 01:02:03.409]  But we gotta cover this up.
[01:02:03.449 --> 01:02:05.551]  I mean, I mean, how do you do that?
[01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:10.604]  How do you not take care of people?
[01:02:11.304 --> 01:02:14.327]  How do you let them knowingly be hurt?
[01:02:15.007 --> 01:02:18.410]  That's how sick the people are that are running things.
[01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:24.314]  And they go out and they recruit other like-minded people just like them.
[01:02:25.114 --> 01:02:25.995]  That's what they do.
[01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:33.861]  They've built an army of scum, an army of control freaks, an army of sociopaths that think that we are all basically their slaves.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.541]  And they're now moving against us.
[01:02:39.521 --> 01:02:42.542]  And it is our duty to stand up against it and say no.
[01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:44.983]  It is our duty to say this is our country.
[01:02:45.043 --> 01:02:48.584]  And if we fight these things, these things are so wildly unpopular.
[01:02:48.604 --> 01:02:51.385]  I mean, everyone's against cameras in bathrooms.
[01:02:51.845 --> 01:02:53.666]  Every time they get caught, they get in trouble, the government.
[01:02:54.146 --> 01:03:00.248]  Everyone is against transponders in the cars, taxing and tracing us and giving us tickets and turning every major road into a toll road.
[01:03:00.788 --> 01:03:02.089]  Again, Houston polls are 98% against it.
[01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.631]  We need to fight it to say no.
[01:03:06.592 --> 01:03:08.193]  You know, we have the moral authority.
[01:03:08.253 --> 01:03:09.934]  We have the majority on our side.
[01:03:10.534 --> 01:03:11.895]  We have to say no to this whole thing.
[01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:19.000]  Now, we're scheduled after the break to have Henry William Brands, who I'm a big fan of, very fair.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.801]  You know, it's not worshipful.
[01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:22.963]  It's even-handed.
[01:03:25.485 --> 01:03:28.887]  History, because I've already read several books about Andrew Jackson, pro and con.
[01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:32.615]  And I think Andrew Jackson was our greatest president, personally.
[01:03:33.055 --> 01:03:37.797]  The most sentinel, the most dynamic, someone who really set our course more than anyone else.
[01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:47.402]  I mean, really, I see the twin peaks of Americana being Andrew Jackson and George Washington.
[01:03:47.522 --> 01:03:50.644]  But, really, George Washington, in so many respects, was a figurehead.
[01:03:50.924 --> 01:03:51.524]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.965 --> 01:04:00.808]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:01.108 --> 01:04:02.508]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.688 --> 01:04:04.889]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:07.130]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:12.352]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.672 --> 01:04:16.714]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:18.735]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.815 --> 01:04:29.461]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.601 --> 01:04:31.502]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:35.564]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.245]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:04:37.265 --> 01:04:37.785]  That's 888-2533139.

[01:04:53.491 --> 01:05:02.113]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:02.334 --> 01:05:13.577]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.817 --> 01:05:16.479]  Yep, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:23.265]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:25.307]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:31.532]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.772 --> 01:05:37.437]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:37.697 --> 01:05:41.940]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:49.284]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:08.572]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[01:06:08.992 --> 01:06:15.013]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[01:06:15.574 --> 01:06:34.899]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[01:06:58.496 --> 01:06:59.136]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.797 --> 01:07:00.857]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.578 --> 01:07:02.679]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:04.159]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.780]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.461 --> 01:07:10.303]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:14.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.248 --> 01:07:25.674]  Alright, our guest has a long bio here.
[01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.737]  We're talking with prolific writer H.W.
[01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:36.403]  Brands about history, politics, and Brand's book, Andrew Jackson, His Life and Times, which brings to life one of Alex's heroes, the true patriot, Andrew Jackson.
[01:07:36.423 --> 01:07:38.684]  That's what's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:39.465 --> 01:07:40.346]  And I'll say this right now.
[01:07:41.247 --> 01:07:42.688]  You know, the man owned slaves.
[01:07:42.788 --> 01:07:44.209]  The man was an Indian fighter.
[01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:46.651]  He fought the Aboriginal population.
[01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:52.314]  But it isn't like it was one of the disgraceful things of the 1880s where they're riding down a bunch of women and children.
[01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.616]  And some of that did go on.
[01:07:54.656 --> 01:07:55.536]  It would be 5,000 Indians against 2,000...
[01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:02.472]  You know, 2,000 Americans or Tennesseans with 1,000 Indians with them.
[01:08:02.492 --> 01:08:03.913]  I mean, the Indians were warlike.
[01:08:04.154 --> 01:08:05.755]  They were killing each other continually.
[01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:06.436]  They were doing this.
[01:08:06.676 --> 01:08:08.118]  And so were Americans.
[01:08:08.599 --> 01:08:10.241]  And so I'm not defending any of that.
[01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:12.924]  And I'm not defending slavery.
[01:08:12.944 --> 01:08:15.827]  You have to realize the time frame it was in, what was going on.
[01:08:15.907 --> 01:08:18.230]  I judge him on his character.
[01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:20.191]  I've read quite a few books on Jackson.
[01:08:20.231 --> 01:08:21.131]  I've been to the Hermitage.
[01:08:21.151 --> 01:08:23.173]  I have read foreign histories on him.
[01:08:23.253 --> 01:08:24.293]  I've read negative histories on him.
[01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:29.436]  I think the best book I've read is the book by Henry William Brands, and we'll tell you about his website today and a lot more.
[01:08:49.159 --> 01:08:51.120]  And folks, he's written a bunch of best-selling books.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.903]  He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the Los Angeles Times Prize, as well as the New York Times Bestseller.
[01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:58.104]  And he wrote The Age of Gold.
[01:08:58.124 --> 01:09:00.285]  It was the Washington Post Best Book of 2002.
[01:09:00.705 --> 01:09:03.807]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:09:04.927 --> 01:09:08.891]  And so we are honored to have him on with us.
[01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:13.275]  He also wrote Lone Star Nation, and that won a bunch of different awards.
[01:09:13.996 --> 01:09:17.839]  And of course he's a historian, a professor, and I just think he did a really fair job.
[01:09:17.879 --> 01:09:25.006]  Because frankly, I've read books that are more glowing, and more vitriolic, and put Jackson on more of a pedestal.
[01:09:25.046 --> 01:09:27.428]  He just went off the facts, and you do get a hero.
[01:09:28.436 --> 01:09:30.819]  And Mr. Brands, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:09:31.139 --> 01:09:32.221]  Delighted to be with you, Alex.
[01:09:32.561 --> 01:09:33.142]  You bet.
[01:09:34.023 --> 01:09:36.146]  We're going to start in just the 15 minutes we've gotten.
[01:09:36.166 --> 01:09:37.468]  A few breaks in there.
[01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:40.892]  First, tell us a little bit about yourself, about history.
[01:09:40.912 --> 01:09:42.454]  We had a nice discussion during the break.
[01:09:43.275 --> 01:09:48.456]  And why history is really a lens or a window to the future, in my opinion.
[01:09:48.656 --> 01:09:51.076]  And then let's go through the life of Andrew Jackson.
[01:09:51.116 --> 01:09:54.157]  I want to take particular time, if we can.
[01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:55.957]  And obviously, folks, you've got to get the book.
[01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:57.458]  I mean, believe me, you want to get this book.
[01:09:58.598 --> 01:10:02.739]  But on his early years and then on his defeat of Lord Wellington's troops.
[01:10:03.279 --> 01:10:03.719]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:10:04.139 --> 01:10:04.319]  Sure.
[01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:07.880]  Well, let me try to answer your question by explaining why I wrote the book on Andrew Jackson.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.700]  I've been teaching American history for about 25 years now.
[01:10:11.191 --> 01:10:13.878]  And I noticed an odd discrepancy.
[01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:19.974]  A discrepancy between people's attitudes toward Jackson during his own lifetime and for the generation to after.
[01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:22.911]  And recent attitudes toward Jackson.
[01:10:23.311 --> 01:10:29.236]  During his own time, Andrew Jackson was considered to be the towering figure of American politics, American public life.
[01:10:29.616 --> 01:10:35.201]  He was often simply referred to as the hero, after his victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.
[01:10:35.461 --> 01:10:39.644]  And for the rest of his life, if you simply said the hero, everybody knew who you were talking about.
[01:10:39.964 --> 01:10:46.890]  Sort of the way people who were interested in American, I don't know, pop music for the last 40 years could just mention the king, and everybody knew you were talking about Elvis Presley.
[01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:48.131]  Or the Beatles, yeah.
[01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:52.253]  Well, yeah, I mean, in some ways, Andrew Jackson was the Elvis Presley of his time.
[01:10:52.614 --> 01:10:56.516]  He was considered a hero fully equal in stature to George Washington.
[01:10:56.576 --> 01:11:00.759]  In fact, he was often considered, he was often called the second George Washington.
[01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:04.041]  But if you really know Washington, he can't hold a candle to Jackson.
[01:11:04.581 --> 01:11:08.444]  Well, Washington had a lot of advantages that Jackson didn't.
[01:11:08.484 --> 01:11:10.525]  Jackson pretty much had to do it all his own.
[01:11:11.218 --> 01:11:19.649]  Anyway, so Jackson was considered this immensely popular figure, a person who dominated American public life during the first half of the 19th century.
[01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:22.553]  In fact, between Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
[01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:31.138]  And in most of the South, even beyond Lincoln, on down into the 20th century, Jackson was the man of American public life and politics.
[01:11:31.518 --> 01:11:33.920]  So, I knew enough about history to understand that part.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:45.551]  I also know enough about American recent politics to know that if you ask people today, if you ask historians, if you ask presidential biographers, if you ask people on the street to name the top five or ten presidents,
[01:11:46.076 --> 01:11:49.817]  Most of them would miss Andrew Jackson, or some would deliberately leave him out.
[01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:53.638]  Well, frankly, I found most even educated people can't even list the first three.
[01:11:53.698 --> 01:11:56.879]  They'll list modern presidents and maybe pro-George Washington then.
[01:11:57.319 --> 01:11:57.539]  Right.
[01:11:57.759 --> 01:12:08.762]  But the thing about Jackson is, unlike Thomas Jefferson, everybody at least knows about Thomas Jefferson, and understands that though he was a slaveholder, he was conflicted on the subject, and so he had a bad conscience.
[01:12:09.562 --> 01:12:10.142]  And that gives
[01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:28.299]  Modern day people in the early 20th century, something to kind of hang on to, because Jefferson, although he, in fact Jefferson owned twice as many slaves as Jackson ever did, he still kind of, he has one foot in the camp of modernity you might say, or to put it another way, Jefferson is at least somewhat
[01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:29.866]  Politically correct.
[01:12:30.226 --> 01:12:33.189]  Because he's saying the right things, even if he's not doing the right things.
[01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:38.895]  The basic problem with Jackson is, he's the most politically incorrect president in American history.
[01:12:39.136 --> 01:12:40.677]  As you said, he was a slaveholder.
[01:12:40.697 --> 01:12:43.760]  But not only was he a slaveholder, he was an unrepentant slaveholder.
[01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:48.145]  You know, George Washington owned more slaves than Jackson did, but at least George Washington
[01:12:48.746 --> 01:12:50.749]  emancipated his slaves after his death.
[01:12:50.789 --> 01:12:52.752]  And you can interpret this one of two ways.
[01:12:53.133 --> 01:13:04.789]  Either he was kind of late seeing the light, or else you could put it a little bit more cynically and say that, well, Washington squeezed all of the exploitation out of the slaves, and then after he died, realizing he couldn't take it away from them.
[01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:08.712]  By the time Andrew Jackson had slaves, it was even becoming an unprofitable thing.
[01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:16.978]  I'm not defending the institution, it was horrible, but by then a lot of times they'd try to free slaves and they wouldn't go anywhere because it was kind of a sharecropping thing.
[01:13:16.998 --> 01:13:22.382]  And of course a large portion of the population that was white was basically in a sharecropping type position.
[01:13:22.422 --> 01:13:28.746]  So my whole point is that it was accepted at the time, and all I look at Jackson as, was he a real person?
[01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:30.727]  Was he controlled by special interests?
[01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:33.049]  Did he defeat the British banking interest?
[01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:38.732]  Who was a leader who actually thought he was doing something for the American people?
[01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:41.834]  And I think looking at Jackson, you cannot deny that he was.
[01:13:42.194 --> 01:13:45.596]  Well, in fact, no one controlled Andrew Jackson.
[01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:51.079]  Most of the people who knew him realized he was, well, some were appalled that he was kind of uncontrollable.
[01:13:51.159 --> 01:13:54.842]  But in fact, Andrew Jackson was very clearly his own man.
[01:13:55.182 --> 01:13:58.944]  He was the first common person to become President of the United States.
[01:13:59.364 --> 01:14:01.946]  He spent no more than a couple of years in formal schooling.
[01:14:01.966 --> 01:14:04.968]  Couldn't we say that he was really the most primitive?
[01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:08.090]  I mean, really, this guy was almost barbarian-like in where he came from.
[01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:10.992]  Let's go over that history that you spend so much time on in the book.
[01:14:11.372 --> 01:14:11.612]  Sure.
[01:14:11.893 --> 01:14:17.116]  At the age of 13, he joined the Revolutionary Army to fight against the British in the American Revolutionary War.
[01:14:17.256 --> 01:14:21.519]  He must have been, he had to have been, one of the youngest soldiers in the Revolutionary Army.
[01:14:21.539 --> 01:14:24.141]  He was taken prisoner after one of the battles.
[01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.975]  He was wounded while a prisoner by a British officer.
[01:14:28.015 --> 01:14:39.070]  In fact, the story that Jackson tells is that this officer, looking at this young kid, he was now 14, ordered the kid, Jackson, to shine his boots, shine the officer's boots.
[01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.032]  And Jackson apparently
[01:14:42.307 --> 01:14:52.434]  told this British officer that he could either shine his boots himself or stick them up his... In other words, he resented the demand and he refused to obey.
[01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:57.718]  The British officer pulled out his sword and took a swipe at Jackson's head with his sword.
[01:14:57.838 --> 01:15:00.860]  Jackson Duck threw up his hand to ward off the blow.
[01:15:01.341 --> 01:15:04.063]  He suffered a severe gash in the side of his hand.
[01:15:04.383 --> 01:15:07.365]  The sword continued and whacked Jackson in the side of his skull.
[01:15:07.405 --> 01:15:09.286]  He bled like a stuck pig.
[01:15:09.807 --> 01:15:11.188]  And for the rest of his life,
[01:15:11.468 --> 01:15:12.029]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:15:32.387 --> 01:15:50.593]  Also, that was Colonel Tavington's troops, who in Mel Gibson's movie, they kind of combine a bunch of different historical events into one, but that's the same Colonel Tavington that's riding around, engaging in all those activities, just to bring it up to speed, which is something modern for people to kind of connect to.
[01:15:50.653 --> 01:15:51.193]  Is that correct?
[01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:57.615]  Well, as a matter of fact, his actual name is Bannister Tarleton, but yeah, he's the model for the Tavington in The Patriot.
[01:15:57.955 --> 01:15:59.296]  Exactly, that same individual, yes.
[01:15:59.556 --> 01:15:59.756]  Right.
[01:16:00.016 --> 01:16:03.118]  So Jackson, when the war ends, Jackson is an orphan.
[01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.760]  His father actually died before he was born.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.661]  He never knew his father.
[01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:08.702]  His mother died during the war.
[01:16:08.742 --> 01:16:10.763]  She fell ill and died.
[01:16:11.124 --> 01:16:14.646]  So at the age of 15, Jackson is basically thrown upon the world.
[01:16:14.706 --> 01:16:17.068]  His two brothers died during the war as well.
[01:16:17.228 --> 01:16:23.192]  And his mother actually walked, I mean, just miles and miles to get him out of the stockade, and then she comes home and dies.
[01:16:23.532 --> 01:16:25.893]  Oh, she was an exceedingly determined person.
[01:16:25.913 --> 01:16:26.634]  And if Jackson
[01:16:27.935 --> 01:16:34.320]  And of course, Jackson's father died before Jackson came out of the womb.
[01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:34.961]  Right.
[01:16:35.401 --> 01:16:40.285]  So Jackson is basically turned loose on the world at the age of 15.
[01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:42.407]  No parents, no siblings.
[01:16:42.888 --> 01:16:50.394]  He did inherit a little bit of money from an uncle back in Scotland, which he promptly proceeded to gamble away.
[01:16:50.995 --> 01:16:53.717]  So now at 16, he doesn't know what to do with himself.
[01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:57.251]  He has no land, he has no money, he has no family.
[01:16:57.531 --> 01:17:02.713]  He decides to do what lots of people in American history have done under similar circumstances, become a lawyer.
[01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:09.716]  Now in those days people didn't go to law school, they typically apprenticed in the office of somebody else.
[01:17:09.736 --> 01:17:18.239]  So Jackson talked himself into an apprenticeship, he spent a couple of years learning the ropes of the legal trade, and then he took the equivalent of the bar exam at the age of about 19.
[01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.220]  And he talked his way past the examiners,
[01:17:21.756 --> 01:17:23.096]  He said, fine, you can become a lawyer.
[01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:27.457]  This was in North Carolina, and the standards for the practice of the law were fairly low.
[01:17:27.937 --> 01:17:31.438]  Jackson decided at this point, though, that North Carolina was too bad.
[01:17:31.458 --> 01:17:34.619]  Plus, he was also a war vet, so that gave him entree into a lot of stuff.
[01:17:35.419 --> 01:17:36.419]  Yes and no.
[01:17:36.479 --> 01:17:43.400]  In fact, you pretty much had to be a war veteran to have any respect in the eyes of your neighbors.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.501]  But because so many people were, it didn't give you any special edge.
[01:17:47.253 --> 01:17:55.855]  One of the things Jackson realized, though, at the age of 1920 was that there were going to be more opportunities out West than there were in North Carolina.
[01:17:56.195 --> 01:18:00.895]  And Jackson took advantage of what would become a standard practice in American history.
[01:18:01.155 --> 01:18:15.838]  That is, for people who don't have money, for people who don't have family, for people who don't have education, the place to go is out West, where you will be judged not on your connections, not on your money, not on your name, but on what you can accomplish,
[01:18:16.286 --> 01:18:18.409]  With your own energy and with your own talent.
[01:18:18.769 --> 01:18:20.671]  So Jackson headed out to Tennessee.
[01:18:20.711 --> 01:18:24.415]  At that time Tennessee was the western district of North Carolina.
[01:18:24.716 --> 01:18:28.640]  And he took an unpaid position as a solicitor.
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:32.545]  Or he's basically the prosecuting attorney for the state of North Carolina.
[01:18:33.462 --> 01:18:34.402]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:18:34.442 --> 01:18:43.165]  We've got to go to break, and we're talking to Professor Brands, who's written the powerful book, Andrew Jackson, and it's on store shelves right now.
[01:18:43.465 --> 01:18:45.485]  I was very impressed with it.
[01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:46.226]  Very fair.
[01:18:47.266 --> 01:18:50.747]  But, I mean, if you want to get real, it's Andrew Jackson.
[01:18:55.928 --> 01:18:56.970]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:57.290 --> 01:19:00.095]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:00.355 --> 01:19:04.501]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:04.942 --> 01:19:05.783]  So what do you do?
[01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:10.671]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:11.127 --> 01:19:13.248]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:14.648]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:18.770]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[01:21:54.099 --> 01:21:55.581]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:59.866]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:03.771]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:07.716]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:22:08.117 --> 01:22:12.963]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:22:13.283 --> 01:22:19.087]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:22:19.388 --> 01:22:23.090]  I now wear my TriVides bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:25.532]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:22:25.873 --> 01:22:31.637]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:22:32.057 --> 01:22:33.238]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:22:33.558 --> 01:22:34.678]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:22:34.758 --> 01:22:40.180]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.842]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:22:44.122 --> 01:22:45.422]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:22:45.442 --> 01:22:45.742]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:23:02.347 --> 01:23:16.539]  During the Civil War, we had Lincoln who wrote multiple letters and gave speeches saying, if I could reunify the Union without freeing one slave, by God, I'd do it.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.201]  It was not about slavery.
[01:23:19.221 --> 01:23:20.963]  It was about controlling Western expansion.
[01:23:20.983 --> 01:23:26.047]  It was about tariffs, which just a few years later after Jackson left office, in the 60s, 1860s, broke out.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.944]  And that almost happened with South Carolina whenever he was president.
[01:23:31.044 --> 01:23:33.988]  We'll talk about that before our guest leaves us.
[01:23:34.469 --> 01:23:36.031]  But it's just not an honest debate.
[01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:36.612]  Oh, why?
[01:23:36.632 --> 01:23:38.675]  You know, George Washington owns slaves.
[01:23:38.735 --> 01:23:43.041]  Well, DynCorp owns them right now and ships them out of Europe and nobody seems to care.
[01:23:43.082 --> 01:23:44.624]  And that's for sex slavery, folks.
[01:23:45.345 --> 01:23:47.806]  You know, the point is, this was a different time, a different world.
[01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:51.448]  There's slavery going on right now in Asia, slavery going on right now in Africa.
[01:23:51.788 --> 01:23:54.669]  Why don't the people who bash Andrew Jackson talk about that?
[01:23:55.049 --> 01:23:59.911]  Why don't these Ford Foundation professors that just hate America and are paid to do it, why don't they talk about that?
[01:24:00.391 --> 01:24:02.132]  It's hypocritical, it's a fraud.
[01:24:02.152 --> 01:24:03.753]  You have to look at the time you are in.
[01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:08.735]  You know, we don't talk about Julius Caesar and go, he was a good guy or he was a bad guy because he owned slaves.
[01:24:09.055 --> 01:24:11.256]  We say he was a bad guy because he was a dictator.
[01:24:12.156 --> 01:24:16.558]  Because he was corrupt over the money power, something that Andrew Jackson did the opposite on.
[01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:27.681]  Something I wish your book would have focused more on, Professor, was of course how he beat twice the big British banking powers that were trying to put in their own central bank here in the United States.
[01:24:27.721 --> 01:24:31.743]  But let's go back just a few minutes here, or back a few years.
[01:24:32.483 --> 01:24:32.743]  Sure.
[01:24:32.783 --> 01:24:40.667]  Well, one of the things that Jackson discovers when he gets out in Tennessee is that if people are going to make their fortune in Tennessee, they're going to make it in land.
[01:24:40.687 --> 01:24:43.648]  In fact, from the very beginning, well, almost until the present,
[01:25:00.245 --> 01:25:04.967]  Buying land, investing in land, watching land grow in value has been the great American pastime.
[01:25:05.547 --> 01:25:09.749]  Jackson began acquiring title to land in Tennessee.
[01:25:09.989 --> 01:25:14.370]  Now at the time, land in Tennessee around Nashville, where he lived, wasn't worth very much at all.
[01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:17.632]  Often, in fact, land was much more plentiful than cash was.
[01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:21.893]  And so Jackson would have to take his fees as a lawyer, often in land.
[01:25:22.413 --> 01:25:29.476]  And in fact, people spoke of land in terms of 640, a square mile, or a half section.
[01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:32.136]  Um, as almost units of currency.
[01:25:32.476 --> 01:25:38.118]  So Jackson often found himself holding title to tens of thousands of acres of land.
[01:25:38.138 --> 01:25:40.279]  Well, there's a term, land rich, money poor.
[01:25:40.479 --> 01:25:42.860]  Well, that's exactly the situation in Tennessee.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:52.824]  But Jackson realized that if he could hold on to the land, eventually he would acquire a fortune because more and more people were coming out to Tennessee and as they did, the land would increase in value.
[01:25:53.124 --> 01:25:59.026]  But acquiring the land put Jackson and everybody else in Tennessee in conflict with the Indian of the area.
[01:25:59.406 --> 01:26:06.368]  At this time, Indians were still in control of much of what is now the American Southeast, then was the Southwest.
[01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:11.870]  In fact, Tennessee and the region was part of the original, what's called the Southwest Territory.
[01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.630]  Anyhow,
[01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:17.430]  And so Jackson and the Tennesseans were in constant conflict with the Indians.
[01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:21.071]  And it was, in certain respects, a philosophical difference.
[01:26:21.492 --> 01:26:28.714]  Because the Tennesseans, the Americans, the farmers, looked at the Indians and said, you've got way more land than you need.
[01:26:29.054 --> 01:26:34.456]  If you guys would take up farming, if you would live the way we do, then we could all have land here.
[01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:39.957]  Now the Indians naturally took the position, we were here first, this is our land, what in the world are you doing here?
[01:26:40.558 --> 01:26:41.238]  It led to
[01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:43.211]  Incessant conflict.
[01:26:43.551 --> 01:26:47.174]  In fact, during the early years, there were Indian raids, there were settler reprisals.
[01:26:47.394 --> 01:26:49.015]  This went on and on and on.
[01:26:49.035 --> 01:26:55.739]  Yeah, Hollywood now just shows the natives being loving and good and getting killed, but in truth, it was slaughter on both sides.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.104]  Well, and as a matter of fact, one thing that's worth bearing in mind is that in every, almost without exception,
[01:27:02.404 --> 01:27:09.791]  In every contest, in every war campaign between Americans and Indians, it was never just Americans and Indians.
[01:27:10.232 --> 01:27:14.756]  It was Americans and their Indian allies against other Indians.
[01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:25.807]  Well, in fact, in George Washington's earliest days, it's the Indian Chiefs always coming to him when he's the head of the Virginia Blues and saying, hey, come fight our enemies for us.
[01:27:26.187 --> 01:27:26.367]  Right.
[01:27:26.487 --> 01:27:27.988]  Or the French using the Indians.
[01:27:28.028 --> 01:27:29.148]  I mean, it's the same story.
[01:27:29.388 --> 01:27:30.448]  That was precisely it.
[01:27:30.809 --> 01:27:44.553]  Anyway, Jackson fairly early on discovered that the most important position, the most prestigious position in Tennessee was not prosecutor, was not judge, was not even governor, but was general of the militia.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:50.003]  Because the militia were the protectors, the forerunners of the National Guard.
[01:27:50.463 --> 01:27:52.624]  These were the protectors of the community.
[01:27:53.065 --> 01:27:56.346]  If a judge screwed up, it meant some legal decision was wrong.
[01:27:56.386 --> 01:27:58.928]  If a governor screwed up, the budget was out of bounds.
[01:27:58.968 --> 01:28:02.570]  But if the general of militia screwed up, the entire community was in danger.
[01:28:04.016 --> 01:28:04.897]  Well, absolutely.
[01:28:05.597 --> 01:28:14.584]  Stay there until he becomes the head of the militia and there's all these big political wranglings and people shooting him and all of this.
[01:28:14.604 --> 01:28:18.867]  We'll talk about it when we get back and then get into his confrontation with the British troops.
[01:28:19.287 --> 01:28:20.068]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:28:24.671 --> 01:28:25.572]  We're on the march.
[01:28:26.072 --> 01:28:27.673]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:28.574 --> 01:28:31.256]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:37.550]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:37.811 --> 01:28:41.633]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:28:41.953 --> 01:28:42.774]  Read the labels.
[01:28:43.214 --> 01:28:47.336]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:51.739]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:56.982]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:28:57.362 --> 01:29:00.964]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:01.144 --> 01:29:06.487]  It's all-natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra-virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:06.748 --> 01:29:09.489]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:09.789 --> 01:29:10.670]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:29:34.668 --> 01:29:37.689]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:37.989 --> 01:29:42.931]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:47.532]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:29:47.832 --> 01:29:56.735]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:56.483]  You know, it's hard in 45 minutes of air time to talk about the life of a giant.
[01:31:56.623 --> 01:31:57.284]  And again,
[01:32:11.912 --> 01:32:20.498]  Imagine a Hollywood movie where the individual is, before he's even born, his father dies.
[01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:25.842]  They live out on the edge of the wilderness in the wilds of South Carolina.
[01:32:26.743 --> 01:32:30.905]  He, his mother, and his two brothers survive living with relatives.
[01:32:31.806 --> 01:32:33.707]  Then in the war, his two brothers die.
[01:32:33.747 --> 01:32:35.229]  He's in a concentration camp.
[01:32:36.129 --> 01:32:41.053]  They slash him across the head and hand with a saber because he basically won't lick their
[01:32:42.336 --> 01:32:57.006]  He then goes and becomes a lawyer, he becomes a prosecutor, a judge, then a militia commander, then he's in all these countless battles with famous people like David Crockett and Sam Houston who were, of course, seminal towering individuals in Texas.
[01:32:57.666 --> 01:33:08.950]  Texas history, beating Lord Wellington's troops who hadn't been beaten in India, fighting eight times their numbers, and had beaten Napoleon, and had beaten him in Spain as well, not just in Waterloo.
[01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:21.515]  So all of this, and then going to be a president, and getting his way, and fighting the money powers, as he called them, and on his deathbed saying, I killed the bank, I beat the bank.
[01:33:22.899 --> 01:33:23.380]  That's all.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:26.022]  I mean, he really is a secret president now.
[01:33:26.082 --> 01:33:28.384]  Some people know who Andrew Jackson is, but most don't.
[01:33:28.425 --> 01:33:30.286]  And if they do, they have a bad opinion of him.
[01:33:30.727 --> 01:33:35.191]  When in truth, he did at least believe he was doing it for the people.
[01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:37.533]  Going back to our guest, H.W.
[01:33:37.573 --> 01:33:38.014]  Brands.
[01:33:38.954 --> 01:33:42.696]  Give us your website, Mr. Brands, and tell us how we can get Andrew Jackson.
[01:33:53.797 --> 01:33:56.439]  Well, the website's real easy, HWBrands.com.
[01:33:56.459 --> 01:33:59.622]  There's no punctuation in there, no dots, just HWBrands.com.
[01:34:00.523 --> 01:34:07.729]  HWBrands.com, brands, B-R-A-N-D-S.com, and I've seen it all over different bookstores that I traffic.
[01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:09.710]  Oh yeah, the books are in all the bookstores.
[01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:12.492]  It's been doing very well, I'm pleased to say.
[01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:16.175]  Well, yeah, and I'm pleased to say some of these hit pieces aren't doing well.
[01:34:16.215 --> 01:34:17.957]  People don't want to read these little hit pieces, do they?
[01:34:19.125 --> 01:34:21.307]  Well, they have a relatively short shelf life.
[01:34:21.588 --> 01:34:27.634]  And when I wrote this book, I didn't set out to write it either pro-Jackson or anti-Jackson.
[01:34:27.694 --> 01:34:29.035]  I just wanted to figure out
[01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:34.983]  No, I like pure history books.
[01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:37.843]  I don't like sappy worship sessions.
[01:34:37.903 --> 01:34:40.004]  I mean, your book just really shows both sides.
[01:34:40.644 --> 01:34:44.585]  And then just by showing the information, you really get a good view.
[01:34:44.905 --> 01:34:48.426]  Why didn't you spend more time on, frankly, on his two presidencies?
[01:34:48.446 --> 01:34:49.947]  I mean, you spent some on the Texas question.
[01:34:50.387 --> 01:35:01.893]  Not a lot of time on the British with assassins sneaking around, or people firing pistols at misfire, or individuals lobbying him to let the banking power in.
[01:35:02.393 --> 01:35:03.894]  He was most proud of that when he died.
[01:35:03.914 --> 01:35:05.615]  I thought that was the only flaw in your book.
[01:35:06.135 --> 01:35:06.795]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:35:07.756 --> 01:35:16.160]  With a life like Jackson's, in certain respects, the presidency was the least exciting eight years of his life.
[01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:17.970]  The rest of his life was civil.
[01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:21.111]  There are other presidents where that's really the heart of the story.
[01:35:21.671 --> 01:35:29.993]  If you write about Lincoln, what makes Lincoln the man that he was, what makes him riveting is his experience as president during the Civil War.
[01:35:30.013 --> 01:35:38.995]  If you're going to write about Franklin Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt had a rather ordinary, well it was privileged, but a rather ordinary existence before he became president.
[01:35:39.255 --> 01:35:41.195]  Just an opium family, yeah.
[01:35:42.496 --> 01:35:43.296]  But Jackson's
[01:35:44.395 --> 01:35:50.518]  Years before he became president, we're so filled with experiences that are foreign to us today.
[01:35:50.718 --> 01:35:52.078]  His duels, for example.
[01:35:52.098 --> 01:36:03.143]  You know, Jackson fought in numerous duels, and I haven't even had a chance to talk about this part of Jackson's life, but one of the most appealing parts of Jackson's life was his relationship with his wife, Rachel.
[01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:07.285]  It was Rachel's honor that provoked Jackson to fight duels.
[01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:11.487]  Jackson is the only president ever to have killed a man in cold blood.
[01:36:11.934 --> 01:36:15.635]  Now, for a lot of people today, that's really off-putting.
[01:36:16.176 --> 01:36:16.596]  What do you want?
[01:36:16.616 --> 01:36:17.696]  You want to murder his president?
[01:36:17.716 --> 01:36:22.298]  Well, in fact, in Jackson's time, that was considered a mark in his favor.
[01:36:22.438 --> 01:36:27.380]  After all, this man had insulted his wife, and it was a matter of honor.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.222]  And so Jackson insists on fighting a duel, which he killed the man.
[01:36:31.882 --> 01:36:40.125]  And when we look at Jackson today, and there are certain aspects of Jackson's attitudes, his personality, his action,
[01:36:40.717 --> 01:36:42.639]  That we have a hard time warming up to.
[01:36:42.699 --> 01:36:48.404]  Jackson's slave-holding, his attitude toward Indians, his militant expansionism.
[01:36:48.644 --> 01:36:52.567]  Well, those were things that people of Jackson's generation valued.
[01:36:52.928 --> 01:37:00.735]  The secret of Jackson's success was that he embodied, he represented the democratic will of the American people.
[01:37:01.355 --> 01:37:11.585]  And if you're going to have a democracy, like we do, then you are going to choose that your great leaders are going to be people who... Well, he said over and over again, everything is the Republic.
[01:37:12.186 --> 01:37:17.030]  And, I mean, just, you know, all the stories of him going against his own vice president, and all of it.
[01:37:17.050 --> 01:37:20.454]  Let's get into those famous Indian battles.
[01:37:20.994 --> 01:37:25.476]  Well, the fundamental thing to remember about Jackson's entire life was that from the time Jackson was born until he died
[01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:54.314]  The United States, the existence of the United States, the independence of the United States was constantly under threat.
[01:37:54.674 --> 01:37:56.496]  It's easy for us to forget that.
[01:37:56.576 --> 01:38:01.900]  After all, we've been living when, for the last hundred years, the United States has been the most powerful country in the world.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.442]  It wasn't so during Jackson's life.
[01:38:04.742 --> 01:38:10.466]  In fact, Jackson experienced a constant threat from external enemies, the British, the French,
[01:38:11.005 --> 01:38:25.759]  uh... indian internal threat from secession so to understand jackson's accomplishment you need to keep in mind that this experiment in self-government was one whose success could never be assured not from the time jackson was born until the time he died.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:35.769]  This was a life and death struggle for those who don't know and frankly i think hollywood has made such a big deal out of the west in the eighteen fifties sixties seventies eighties
[01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:51.646]  You know, even modern films like Open Range and things set in the 1890s, all of that is nothing compared to the swashbuckling, pirate-like warring and struggling and spying and double-dealing and
[01:38:52.066 --> 01:38:52.807]  Yes, we are.
[01:39:12.245 --> 01:39:18.690]  Well, in fact, what Jackson waged was perhaps the first war on terror in American history.
[01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:36.484]  Because Jackson's campaign against the Red Sticks, this was a militant band of Creek Indians in what's now Alabama, Mississippi, was precipitated by a massacre that the Red Sticks, the Creeks, inflicted upon settlers, about 250 settlers, a place called Fort Mims.
[01:39:37.268 --> 01:39:39.609]  In the southern part of Mississippi Territory, as it then was.
[01:39:39.989 --> 01:39:46.292]  And the entire purpose of this massacre was to terrorize the American settlement.
[01:39:46.732 --> 01:39:49.474]  To drive the Americans away from the Southeast.
[01:39:49.554 --> 01:39:55.156]  And by the way, there have been previous battles all over where major forces larger than Jackson's, even U.S.
[01:39:55.196 --> 01:39:57.237]  government forces, were being beaten by the Indians.
[01:39:57.637 --> 01:39:57.837]  Right.
[01:39:58.057 --> 01:40:03.720]  And as a matter of fact, this was part of the most successful Indian alliance
[01:40:04.439 --> 01:40:07.862]  In the history of North America, it's one that was put together by Tecumseh, the great Shawnee chief.
[01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:13.567]  And it had for its devout purpose, what can be described as nothing less than a race war.
[01:40:14.107 --> 01:40:16.449]  This was going to be a war of Indians against whites.
[01:40:16.809 --> 01:40:24.896]  And the whole point was to drive, first of all, to kill as many whites as possible, and to drive the rest out of the West, back to the Atlantic coast.
[01:40:25.677 --> 01:40:29.600]  And this was something that Tecumseh worked for years to organize.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.062]  And the attack of the Red Sticks,
[01:40:32.521 --> 01:40:32.861]  I think?
[01:40:53.027 --> 01:40:57.430]  To the extent that people know about the War of 1812 today, they remember it as a war between the United States and the British.
[01:40:57.450 --> 01:41:05.735]  But in fact, it was a war between the United States and its Indian allies against Britain and Britain's Indian allies.
[01:41:05.775 --> 01:41:11.818]  And the first part of the war, especially for Jackson, in the Southwest, was fighting Britain's Indian allies.
[01:41:12.139 --> 01:41:19.223]  Jackson won a great victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, and it was this that brought him to national attention.
[01:41:19.736 --> 01:41:31.117]  So that President Madison and the Secretary of War decided they needed to bring Jackson from command of the Tennessee militia into a commanding position in the U.S.
[01:41:31.277 --> 01:41:31.498]  Army.
[01:41:31.963 --> 01:41:36.227]  So he was promoted sort of sideways from Major General of the Tennessee Militia.
[01:41:36.327 --> 01:41:49.317]  And of course we're skipping over the stuff in the book about all the times that his superiors would give him orders that he thought were wrong and he'd disobey them and just, you know, duels or where he's walking through the street and somebody shoots him twice in the chest and he almost bleeds to death.
[01:41:49.357 --> 01:41:52.060]  I mean, this guy was like a pin cushion of wounds.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.563]  In fact, he spent most of his life carrying several bullets around in his body.
[01:41:56.924 --> 01:42:00.867]  And there's some reason to believe that the lead that leached out of those bullets had
[01:42:01.463 --> 01:42:01.863]  I think so.
[01:42:11.961 --> 01:42:15.223]  And to dose themselves with various compounds of mercury.
[01:42:15.603 --> 01:42:17.864]  So people were swimming in heavy metals in those days.
[01:42:18.244 --> 01:42:20.445]  Hey, nowadays the news is saying it's nutritious.
[01:42:20.625 --> 01:42:21.946]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:42:22.746 --> 01:42:25.068]  I've got this local newscast saying mercury in the vaccines is good.
[01:42:25.308 --> 01:42:26.428]  Yeah, they would dose them.
[01:42:26.508 --> 01:42:27.449]  Arsenic's a heavy metal.
[01:42:27.489 --> 01:42:28.389]  People would take that.
[01:42:28.889 --> 01:42:31.511]  And it would drive you actually kind of crazy.
[01:42:31.571 --> 01:42:38.074]  Well, and one of the remarkable things about this is to imagine how tough these people must have been.
[01:42:38.686 --> 01:42:42.808]  Because we have this notion today that somehow if your health isn't perfect, there's something wrong.
[01:42:42.828 --> 01:42:44.929]  You ought to be able to take something and do something to fix it.
[01:42:45.289 --> 01:42:51.091]  Well, in those days, people sort of expected that if you live long enough, you're going to come down with various diseases and ailments.
[01:42:51.372 --> 01:42:55.333]  And they woke up every morning not thinking about, oh gosh, this isn't right or that isn't right.
[01:42:55.373 --> 01:42:56.794]  They were just happy to be alive.
[01:42:57.270 --> 01:43:11.844]  Well, anyway, Jackson survived through all of this, but he was often operating, well, he was always operating at less than optimum health, either from the bullets or from a recent duel that he'd fought, or he had chronic intestinal ailments for his entire life.
[01:43:12.264 --> 01:43:18.270]  He was almost painfully thin, and there were times when he was basically existing on gin and coffee.
[01:43:19.025 --> 01:43:20.105]  He seemed to agree with him.
[01:43:20.125 --> 01:43:26.886]  The odd thing was that when he was on campaign, when he was out in the field, he often felt better and was able to operate more effectively.
[01:43:26.906 --> 01:43:28.947]  But his wife's good cooking when put him in bed, yeah.
[01:43:29.007 --> 01:43:29.487]  That's it.
[01:43:29.527 --> 01:43:30.587]  That was exactly it.
[01:43:30.867 --> 01:43:31.727]  The rich food at home.
[01:43:32.047 --> 01:43:33.768]  He was also very worshipful of women.
[01:43:33.788 --> 01:43:38.188]  He hated the high society of D.C.
[01:43:39.089 --> 01:43:46.410]  where they were just constantly criticizing women who were wives of his cabinet, and so he didn't put up with that either.
[01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:57.297]  Well, as a matter of fact, one of the real blunders, if you want to call it a blunder of his presidency, was his perhaps excessive loyalty to Peggy Eaton and her husband John Eaton.
[01:43:57.717 --> 01:44:07.344]  This was a woman who was criticized for political and personal reasons, but Jackson was someone who could never bring himself to think ill of a woman.
[01:44:08.205 --> 01:44:13.088]  And so he stuck by Peggy Eaton probably, well, longer than he should have as
[01:44:13.835 --> 01:44:18.657]  A lot of that comes from the image of his mother, because he never even met his father, who died before he was born.
[01:44:18.757 --> 01:44:20.317]  His mother and his wife, Rachel.
[01:44:20.457 --> 01:44:25.759]  Rachel actually was a political casualty of the campaign, the presidential campaign of 1828.
[01:44:25.879 --> 01:44:30.801]  She got a heart attack because of all the criticisms just days before he was to be inaugurated, right?
[01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:31.682]  Oh, that's exactly it.
[01:44:31.802 --> 01:44:35.183]  In fact, we often think that politics today is low and dirty.
[01:44:35.243 --> 01:44:41.325]  It's nothing like politics in the 1820s, when people did fight duels, when people died as a result of politics.
[01:44:42.071 --> 01:44:44.032]  Yeah, there were fights on the House floor.
[01:44:44.313 --> 01:44:44.913]  Let's go back.
[01:44:44.933 --> 01:44:46.954]  So we have the War of 1812.
[01:44:46.994 --> 01:44:49.096]  The British actually attack D.C.
[01:44:50.737 --> 01:44:52.058]  They burn down the White House.
[01:44:52.378 --> 01:44:55.680]  They're firing their cannons into the population.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:58.001]  Meanwhile, they send the General.
[01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:01.123]  He's now General Jackson.
[01:45:01.784 --> 01:45:04.626]  Quickly, we've got about four minutes before the break, Professor, and we're so honored to have you.
[01:45:04.666 --> 01:45:08.108]  Go through how he defeated an army that had never been defeated.
[01:45:08.528 --> 01:45:11.649]  Okay, the thing to remember is how important the Battle of New Orleans was.
[01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:27.535]  The British had a strategy whereby they would defeat Jackson at New Orleans, they would march up the Mississippi River, their southern army marching north would combine with an army from Canada marching south, and they would literally split the United States in two along the line of the Mississippi River.
[01:45:27.955 --> 01:45:35.158]  They would either give Louisiana back to Spain, Britain's ally, or give it to the Indians and set it up as a
[01:45:36.561 --> 01:45:36.942]  I don't think so.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:53.585]  The United States would have been split into, and quite possibly, American democracy.
[01:45:53.805 --> 01:45:55.928]  The whole idea of American self-government would have been at risk.
[01:45:56.108 --> 01:45:59.191]  Whether the United States could have survived that defeat is an open question.
[01:45:59.812 --> 01:46:02.314]  No one, no one expected that Jackson could win.
[01:46:02.575 --> 01:46:09.502]  The British had tromped all over American forces through most of the war, and now they were being reinforced by these fresh troops from Europe.
[01:46:10.542 --> 01:46:16.127]  Wellington's Invincibles, as they were called, they had never been defeated, and they were going to take on Jackson at New Orleans.
[01:46:16.147 --> 01:46:17.569]  They greatly outnumbered Jackson.
[01:46:17.889 --> 01:46:21.332]  Jackson had the most rag-tag army, perhaps, in American history.
[01:46:21.432 --> 01:46:25.396]  It was made up of former black slaves, it was made up of Indians, it was made up of, yeah.
[01:46:25.676 --> 01:46:28.278]  It consisted of Tennessee volunteers and some Army regulars.
[01:46:28.359 --> 01:46:30.901]  It consisted of members of various Indian tribes.
[01:46:31.361 --> 01:46:32.963]  of slaves, of free African-Americans.
[01:46:33.163 --> 01:46:37.086]  There were 800 Haitians there, and I still haven't figured out exactly what the Haitians were doing there.
[01:46:37.326 --> 01:46:40.169]  But nonetheless, there were pirates under Jean Lafitte.
[01:46:40.749 --> 01:46:45.253]  And the only thing that welded them together, held them together, was Jackson's will.
[01:46:45.334 --> 01:46:49.457]  Jackson, perhaps, had the most powerful will of any one of his generation.
[01:46:49.837 --> 01:46:53.481]  Jackson believed that he could win because he must win.
[01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:57.024]  And he persuaded, he cajoled, he
[01:46:57.688 --> 01:47:00.430]  It forced everybody at New Orleans to fight.
[01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:03.572]  There were a lot of French and Spanish nationals in New Orleans.
[01:47:03.732 --> 01:47:04.632]  They didn't want to fight at all.
[01:47:04.672 --> 01:47:09.275]  They would have been quite happy if New Orleans and Louisiana had reverted to French or Spanish control.
[01:47:09.515 --> 01:47:12.697]  But Jackson made them fight, made them believe that they could win.
[01:47:13.017 --> 01:47:19.962]  And in this absolutely astonishing battle, on the morning of January 8, 1815, Jackson won this tremendous victory.
[01:47:20.982 --> 01:47:26.746]  2,000 British soldiers were killed, captured, or wounded against less than two dozen on the American side.
[01:47:27.173 --> 01:47:31.214]  When the rest of the United States heard of Jackson's victory, they couldn't believe it.
[01:47:31.254 --> 01:47:39.457]  It was as though God had come down and delivered the United States from this grave danger using Andrew Jackson as his agent.
[01:47:39.897 --> 01:47:44.579]  And from then until the rest of his life, Andrew Jackson was known simply as the hero.
[01:47:44.919 --> 01:47:48.700]  Immediately, people began talking about Andrew Jackson for president.
[01:47:49.161 --> 01:47:52.042]  It was one of the most astonishing moments in American history.
[01:47:52.062 --> 01:47:55.363]  Yeah, to be specific, they were landing a bunch of the Invincibles and
[01:47:56.907 --> 01:48:05.552]  They got him bottlenecked there and then Jackson was able to get there and they built some works against him and that's quite a battle right there with the British troops climbing up over and all.
[01:48:05.572 --> 01:48:06.853]  It was like an Alamo, really.
[01:48:07.413 --> 01:48:10.995]  Well, in fact, the Battle of New Orleans actually took place over a couple of weeks.
[01:48:11.015 --> 01:48:22.402]  It started with an artillery battle in which Jackson's pirates, the pirates from Barataria under Jean Lafitte, used their skill that they had acquired seizing
[01:48:23.198 --> 01:48:23.318]  Yes.
[01:48:45.131 --> 01:48:53.053]  Operated on the principle that they would march across this open field and essentially strike terror into the hearts of those people that were defending.
[01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:56.794]  And that had worked with the French, that had worked with people in India, but it didn't work here.
[01:48:57.155 --> 01:49:05.117]  No, it didn't, because Jackson, well, in fact, the defenders decided that they probably had more to fear from Jackson than they had from the British.
[01:49:05.677 --> 01:49:11.979]  And Jackson coolly told them to, he really did say the equivalent of, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
[01:49:12.389 --> 01:49:16.011]  They had to let them get close enough so that the musket fire would have an effect.
[01:49:16.511 --> 01:49:28.118]  And then when it did, the muskets in conjunction with the cannons that were lowered down to where they would just blast across at head height, mowed enormous, appalling swaths through the British forces.
[01:49:28.718 --> 01:49:31.740]  And within the space of an hour, the British Army was decimated.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.741]  They tried what, four different attacks though?
[01:49:33.761 --> 01:49:35.182]  They kept sending wave after wave?
[01:49:35.342 --> 01:49:40.085]  Wave after wave after wave, and as often as they came, they were decimated by Jackson's fire.
[01:49:41.395 --> 01:49:42.156]  Amazing story.
[01:49:42.176 --> 01:49:43.498]  And then there's the whole presidency.
[01:49:44.179 --> 01:49:45.761]  We've got one more segment with you, Professor.
[01:49:45.781 --> 01:49:51.769]  I want to get you back up sometime for a part two on this and talk about your book about Texas as well, which I had the pleasure of reading it.
[01:49:52.049 --> 01:49:52.690]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.710 --> 01:49:53.071]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.569 --> 01:49:58.412]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.673 --> 01:50:00.255]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.595 --> 01:50:05.261]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.621 --> 01:50:12.349]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.669 --> 01:50:14.650]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.850 --> 01:50:17.692]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.792 --> 01:50:22.455]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.655 --> 01:50:27.037]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:27.297 --> 01:50:34.521]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:51:13.073 --> 01:51:19.801]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:20.202 --> 01:51:31.956]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:53:01.164 --> 01:53:03.966]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.888 --> 01:53:07.089]  We've been talking about the book.
[01:53:08.195 --> 01:53:09.756]  Andrew Jackson is live in Times.
[01:53:09.816 --> 01:53:11.397]  Information at Infowars.com.
[01:53:11.417 --> 01:53:14.379]  You can link through over to the author's website.
[01:53:14.399 --> 01:53:27.848]  And again, it's a very even-handed... I mean, you can get into the whole books that have been written just with his quotes all about fighting the bankers and fighting the centralization by all the scallywags and the rest of it.
[01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:35.793]  It is so important that we take this history that's been robbed from us and just simply be honest about it.
[01:53:36.551 --> 01:53:44.536]  Simply be honest about it, because now we have presidents that are just bought and paid for the creations of advertisement agencies and their financial interest.
[01:53:45.857 --> 01:53:54.082]  And there were presidents like that back in those days as well, but when you get down to somebody like Andrew Jackson, I mean, imagine, why hasn't Hollywood made a movie?
[01:53:54.102 --> 01:53:57.164]  I mean, imagine the flair of that.
[01:53:58.024 --> 01:54:00.306]  An individual who was an orphan,
[01:54:01.511 --> 01:54:06.134]  By the time he was 14 years old, never saw his father, who died before he was born.
[01:54:06.174 --> 01:54:09.357]  Both his brothers dying in the war, one dying in the concentration camp.
[01:54:10.177 --> 01:54:27.950]  Just all the things that happened this whole life, and we haven't told you, but a thimble's full of this great repository that is there, because there is just so much that has gone on.
[01:54:28.170 --> 01:54:30.832]  Now, before we go back to our guests here in the last few little minutes,
[01:54:32.817 --> 01:54:33.639]  I have the new film.
[01:54:33.699 --> 01:54:34.600]  It's the Order of Death.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.983]  We snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:36.023 --> 01:54:37.545]  We show you what the world leaders are doing.
[01:54:37.585 --> 01:54:38.687]  We caught it all on tape.
[01:54:38.727 --> 01:54:41.291]  Well, now we had another infiltrator that got us the footage.
[01:54:41.312 --> 01:54:41.993]  He did a great job.
[01:54:43.237 --> 01:54:44.358]  Who worked there for two years.
[01:54:44.458 --> 01:54:46.300]  We've got Inside the Sacrificial Owl.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.321]  We've got video from outside of it.
[01:54:48.721 --> 01:54:54.906]  And we've got the tie-ins to the Ku Klux Klan and all these secret societies that the Globalists are a part of.
[01:54:54.986 --> 01:55:00.571]  And then on the same DVD, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the original infiltration, updated.
[01:55:00.971 --> 01:55:06.355]  Both films, one price, one DVD, one VHS, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:06.375 --> 01:55:08.437]  Of course, there's my film, Martial Law, that's amazing.
[01:55:08.897 --> 01:55:09.717]  You need all of them.
[01:55:09.737 --> 01:55:11.438]  A lot of new specials for the new year.

[01:55:21.001 --> 01:55:21.581]  15 cents a day.
[01:55:21.601 --> 01:55:23.042]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:55:23.062 --> 01:55:23.922]  My weekly TV show.
[01:55:23.962 --> 01:55:25.562]  My documentary films.
[01:55:25.582 --> 01:55:25.842]  My book.
[01:55:25.862 --> 01:55:26.883]  Paul Watson's book.
[01:55:37.847 --> 01:55:40.829]  Well, one thing to remember about Andrew Jackson is that
[01:56:01.838 --> 01:56:04.299]  Almost single-handedly, he held the Union together.
[01:56:04.359 --> 01:56:07.199]  He did so first militarily at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.
[01:56:07.639 --> 01:56:11.741]  He did it again in 1833, went to South Carolina, threatened to secede from the Union.
[01:56:12.221 --> 01:56:15.621]  It's often forgotten because it was a secession that didn't happen.
[01:56:15.682 --> 01:56:20.003]  But the reason it didn't happen was that Andrew Jackson was President of the United States at the time.
[01:56:20.443 --> 01:56:24.624]  South Carolinians were upset about a tariff tax bill that they thought was too high.
[01:56:24.704 --> 01:56:27.564]  And he told their leaders, I'm going to come down there and kill you.
[01:56:27.905 --> 01:56:29.065]  Well, that's exactly what he said.
[01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:34.324]  When they threatened to secede, Jackson let them know that if they seceded, it meant war.
[01:56:34.665 --> 01:56:39.809]  And he laid preparations to march at the head of an army of 200,000 men down into South Carolina.
[01:56:40.349 --> 01:56:50.897]  And when the South Carolinians got wind of this, they realized, well, they finally knew who they were tangling with, and they decided to rescind their order of secession and to reconsider.
[01:56:51.218 --> 01:56:57.082]  Now, it's worth thinking about what would have happened had somebody like Andrew Jackson been president in 1860.
[01:56:58.413 --> 01:57:03.441]  When the Civil War occurred, when secession occurred, it occurred largely because the South didn't think the North would fight.
[01:57:03.741 --> 01:57:05.644]  It was the same thing all over again.
[01:57:05.664 --> 01:57:10.111]  And Andrew Jackson, of course, then did less in the tariff, though.
[01:57:10.131 --> 01:57:11.333]  He did make a compromise with them.
[01:57:11.794 --> 01:57:12.315]  Well, he did.
[01:57:12.355 --> 01:57:13.517]  He was smart enough to know that.
[01:57:13.997 --> 01:57:15.638]  He was going to have to give them some precedence.
[01:57:15.658 --> 01:57:17.038]  Tell you what, Professor, this is an important point.
[01:57:17.318 --> 01:57:18.879]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:57:18.899 --> 01:57:19.979]  We've got a one-minute break.
[01:57:20.399 --> 01:57:22.280]  We've got a little five-minute segment coming up.
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.921]  Do five more minutes with us, okay?
[01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:24.881]  Alex, I've got to run.
[01:57:24.941 --> 01:57:26.141]  Okay, you've got to go back to your classes.
[01:57:26.362 --> 01:57:27.902]  Listen, I really appreciate you joining us.
[01:57:28.202 --> 01:57:28.842]  Okay, thank you.
[01:57:28.962 --> 01:57:29.223]  You bet.
[01:57:29.243 --> 01:57:29.583]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:29.843 --> 01:57:31.383]  Alright, we've got Paul Watson coming up.
[01:57:34.044 --> 01:57:38.926]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:51.211]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.871 --> 01:57:52.932]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.653 --> 01:57:54.774]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.414 --> 01:57:56.215]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.976 --> 01:57:57.876]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.896 --> 01:58:02.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:06.823]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:19.914]  Another amazing thing about Andrew Jackson, who we were talking to an award-winning author and history professor in the last hour about, was that he didn't like the crowds.
[01:58:19.934 --> 01:58:21.115]  He didn't like the adulation.
[01:58:21.135 --> 01:58:22.195]  He liked his little farm.
[01:58:23.576 --> 01:58:25.937]  And, you know, the book, I said, was balanced.
[01:58:25.957 --> 01:58:28.958]  It doesn't get into his fighting with a fellow reserve in the same crowd.
[01:58:28.978 --> 01:58:35.821]  It doesn't get into him trying to basically bring them down and holding them off.
[01:58:35.981 --> 01:58:41.063]  And, of course, he was against a civil war because he knew the British were agitating the entire thing.
[01:58:44.208 --> 01:58:49.174]  I'm not saying the North was good or what the North did was good.
[01:58:49.194 --> 01:58:50.276]  It was all bad.
[01:58:50.716 --> 01:58:53.740]  It's just that the British really were manipulating all of that.
[01:58:54.601 --> 01:58:56.424]  And now we have a chance to talk to one of them.
[01:58:56.544 --> 01:58:58.647]  One of the great evils, as Andrew Jackson said.
[01:59:00.092 --> 01:59:01.674]  Ultimate Boogeyman Creatures.
[01:59:01.734 --> 01:59:04.357]  We actually have one with us.
[01:59:04.477 --> 01:59:07.140]  Lord Watson of Canterbury.
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.541]  Watson, good to have you with us.
[01:59:09.062 --> 01:59:10.063]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:59:10.383 --> 01:59:11.705]  I'm sorry to have to tease you.
[01:59:11.785 --> 01:59:12.946]  It's just fun to do.
[01:59:12.966 --> 01:59:14.788]  Well, you know, I'm not really sorry.
[01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:17.271]  You can make fun of me, though.
[01:59:17.291 --> 01:59:17.631]  Go ahead.
[01:59:17.691 --> 01:59:18.452]  Go ahead if you want to.
[01:59:19.609 --> 01:59:23.855]  Well, you can talk bad about the government, boys.
[01:59:24.536 --> 01:59:25.137]  That's right.
[01:59:25.357 --> 01:59:27.800]  Don't you talk about George Bush, who I associate with my daddy.
[01:59:28.882 --> 01:59:32.827]  Oh man, he was my daddy before he was my daddy's daddy, or whatever your brother said.
[01:59:32.847 --> 01:59:34.089]  That was a great little piece we did.
[01:59:35.791 --> 01:59:36.812]  Alright, I'll quit screwing around.
[01:59:36.832 --> 01:59:41.415]  You know, there's so much serious news, so many serious things happening we need to talk about.
[01:59:41.435 --> 01:59:52.082]  Remember two years ago, Paul, I talked about how the New York Times had an article about how your cable and your computer, you'd be able to dial in to all the surveillance cameras and watch everybody and even get paid to do it?
[01:59:52.102 --> 01:59:52.782]  Yeah.
[01:59:53.283 --> 02:00:00.988]  Well, now in England that's going to start on your major cable systems with the city, but it's going to be interactive, but you've got to pay to be part of it.
[02:00:01.949 --> 02:00:02.489]  That's right.
[02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:05.491]  Launched in a borough of London today.
[02:00:06.936 --> 02:00:20.519]  Um, it's basically what they're doing is people pay £3.50 which is about $5 or more a month to watch the CCTV cameras and they're encouraged to report suspicious behaviour.
[02:00:21.399 --> 02:00:30.661]  And it's kind of like something called the Delphi Technique which they use to make people believe they're involved in the very programmes that oppress them.
[02:00:31.161 --> 02:00:33.662]  Make them, you know, think they're part of the power structure.
[02:00:34.426 --> 02:00:36.567]  To boil it down, it's like paying lip service.
[02:00:36.827 --> 02:00:40.568]  We want to hear what everyone has to say at the meeting and then go, okay, we heard what you said.
[02:00:40.628 --> 02:00:42.149]  You said you want the slavery.
[02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:44.389]  And it doesn't matter if you said you didn't want it.
[02:00:44.409 --> 02:00:46.790]  They just go, well, we heard what you had to say.
[02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:48.311]  Exactly.
[02:00:48.491 --> 02:01:00.415]  It ties into the fact that although some of the latest CCTV systems automatically detect, you know, loitering and suspicious behavior, they don't even need anyone to watch them.
[02:01:01.392 --> 02:01:05.456]  Um, the non-mechanized aspect of it does need somebody to watch them.
[02:01:05.576 --> 02:01:09.880]  And obviously you can't have somebody watching every camera at every hour of the day.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:12.302]  It's like when you talk about Echelon.
[02:01:12.502 --> 02:01:16.085]  It's like coming home to having three million answer phone messages.
[02:01:16.105 --> 02:01:17.586]  You just can't sift through them all.
[02:01:17.666 --> 02:01:21.229]  So, although everything's recorded, not everything's analyzed.
[02:01:22.190 --> 02:01:28.736]  Um, but in the case of Britain, it comes at the same time as the British government and the Metropolitan Police.
[02:01:29.398 --> 02:01:30.779]  Oh, do me a favor, I forgot to do that.
[02:01:30.799 --> 02:01:32.620]  Will you instant message that to the network?
[02:01:51.565 --> 02:01:56.826]  Yeah, it says things like, you know, you enjoy your nice lifestyle, you enjoy seeing your friends.
[02:01:57.006 --> 02:01:59.087]  Well, if you want to, you better stop the terrorists.
[02:01:59.127 --> 02:02:00.467]  Did they cash a check wrong?
[02:02:00.687 --> 02:02:04.268]  And then, of course, terror is all crime, because there's not going to be any real terror, folks.
[02:02:04.688 --> 02:02:12.030]  Well, look, they give examples, potential signs of terrorism, you know, judging on the message being sent out by these posters.
[02:02:12.570 --> 02:02:16.811]  Living in a house or an apartment is a potential sign of terrorism, according to them.
[02:02:17.699 --> 02:02:20.441]  As opposed to say, terrorists need places to live.
[02:02:20.581 --> 02:02:22.683]  Are you suspicious of your tenants and neighbors?
[02:02:23.944 --> 02:02:26.767]  So basically, we've got to teach you how to be suspicious of everyone.
[02:02:27.107 --> 02:02:29.549]  Yeah, and if you live in a house, then you may be a terrorist.
[02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:31.010]  Aha, yes.
[02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:33.532]  If you have a car, you may be a terrorist.
[02:02:34.733 --> 02:02:35.354]  Stay there, Paul.
[02:02:35.374 --> 02:02:42.980]  I want to go over all this in detail, and instant message that over to the little pollywogs at the network, and we'll get it out to people.
[02:02:46.952 --> 02:02:49.894]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.554 --> 02:02:51.855]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:52.055 --> 02:02:57.799]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[02:03:03.623 --> 02:03:05.244]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order

[02:03:07.925 --> 02:03:11.706]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.966 --> 02:03:16.627]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.707 --> 02:03:19.468]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:03:19.768 --> 02:03:22.948]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:03:22.988 --> 02:03:24.769]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:04:47.114 --> 02:04:50.415]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.

[02:04:56.278 --> 02:04:58.179]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[02:05:47.347 --> 02:05:53.391]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.991 --> 02:05:57.033]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.135 --> 02:06:02.116]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 p.m.
[02:06:02.317 --> 02:06:05.779]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:06:06.739 --> 02:06:13.924]  We have our great friend from Northern England joining us, where they're known for standing up against
[02:06:14.705 --> 02:06:16.006]  Tyranny as well.
[02:06:16.086 --> 02:06:18.947]  Yes, that's the MO I get from the folks over in Europe.
[02:06:19.307 --> 02:06:22.748]  Those evil, evil folks from northern England.
[02:06:23.228 --> 02:06:25.569]  Our little Scotty, Waddy, Lord Watson.
[02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:28.711]  And he is on with us right now.
[02:06:29.751 --> 02:06:31.552]  And here's the news, folks.
[02:06:31.592 --> 02:06:32.612]  I talked about this in the first hour.
[02:06:32.632 --> 02:06:33.552]  We'll talk about it more today.
[02:06:33.592 --> 02:06:37.294]  Bush Advisors says the President has legal power to torture children and crush their testicles.
[02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:45.218]  And he was asked about it at a big University of Chicago symposium, arguing with a Notre Dame professor, and he said it's good, and they'll do it, and they can also commit genocide.
[02:06:46.499 --> 02:07:01.174]  So, you know, it's just unbelievable to hear this out of them, and this is one of the other advisors who was in the same department there as White House counsels, as our current Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, who said that they were above the law,
[02:07:02.256 --> 02:07:14.379]  And I also have this news about how GM food killing mammal babies, that is six times a higher level in infant mortality with those that have eaten genetically modified crops.
[02:07:14.739 --> 02:07:16.799]  Folks, this stuff is actual poison.
[02:07:17.399 --> 02:07:19.420]  You're worried about smoking two packs of cigarettes a day?
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:22.220]  Well, I would be if you do, but that's a lot less dangerous.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:30.502]  Drinking Jack Daniels every day, ten shots of it, and smoking two packs of cigarettes is less dangerous from the studies I've seen.
[02:07:31.831 --> 02:07:34.832]  I mean, it'll kill you faster to be eating this stuff.
[02:07:34.852 --> 02:07:35.612]  And are they stopping?
[02:07:35.632 --> 02:07:36.753]  No, it's just going into everything.
[02:07:37.273 --> 02:07:38.953]  Paul, my head is starting to spin.
[02:07:38.973 --> 02:07:40.934]  I mean, is your head starting to spin?
[02:07:40.974 --> 02:07:44.235]  Are they just not... I mean, that's more radical than I thought.
[02:07:44.275 --> 02:07:47.956]  They go in front of a supposium and go, yeah, we can crush children's testicles.
[02:07:47.996 --> 02:07:49.196]  I mean, where do they come up?
[02:07:49.216 --> 02:07:50.736]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[02:07:50.997 --> 02:07:52.477]  What is their major malfunction?
[02:07:53.894 --> 02:08:04.516]  Well, they've given themselves carte blanche to do anything they like, you know, under the auspices of the noble lie that the ends justify the means, and they don't.
[02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.817]  It's like the mercury in vaccines.
[02:08:07.377 --> 02:08:18.339]  There was a comedy skit on a Canadian politics comedy show where they were asking the people who'd just taken the flu shot if they knew that the vaccine had mercury in it.
[02:08:18.899 --> 02:08:20.980]  None of them did, and they all said,
[02:08:21.536 --> 02:08:23.837]  You know, I've just got blind faith in government.
[02:08:23.997 --> 02:08:26.138]  I think they're here to protect me and I trust them.
[02:08:26.819 --> 02:08:32.682]  You know, the same kind of government that... Now, was it one of those comedy skits where the comedy guy goes out and interviews, you know, real people?
[02:08:33.682 --> 02:08:33.923]  Yeah.
[02:08:35.523 --> 02:08:36.444]  Have I missed that video?
[02:08:37.874 --> 02:08:39.656]  It was on Perspective last week.
[02:08:40.156 --> 02:08:43.138]  Oh, man, you've got to instant message that to the network, too.
[02:08:43.179 --> 02:08:43.919]  We'll air that in a minute.
[02:08:44.179 --> 02:08:45.841]  Now, I know I'm digressing.
[02:08:45.861 --> 02:08:52.306]  I want to go back to this in a minute with the GM Foods and whatever else you want to talk about and the Shickas saying, you know, that they can torture small children.
[02:08:52.946 --> 02:08:54.207]  I mean, this is how sick it is, folks.
[02:08:54.227 --> 02:08:56.569]  And then, of course, they have all the TV shows that say the same thing.
[02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:59.532]  Mass conditioning, a unified front of pure wickedness.
[02:09:00.132 --> 02:09:01.153]  I mean, this is wickedness.
[02:09:01.213 --> 02:09:02.234]  But going back to
[02:09:03.254 --> 02:09:08.256]  What's happening in London now, and even the BBC says it's Stasi Big Brother.
[02:09:08.737 --> 02:09:11.558]  Even the Register, we can all be Big Brother now.
[02:09:12.138 --> 02:09:16.480]  And it says you've read the book and seen the film, now you can oppress the proletariat.
[02:09:16.961 --> 02:09:28.386]  Yes, it's true, you can take part in a groundbreaking social engineering project without leaving the comfort and safety of your own ivory tower, which we call rubbish, using three same-and-fear architect who kiddied out the office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
[02:09:28.966 --> 02:09:33.908]  And it goes on to say that now the cable, and this is just starting in one area, it's going to be nationwide.
[02:09:34.268 --> 02:09:38.429]  Again, they've said this here, but here they're going to make us all watch each other.
[02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:39.830]  That was in the New York Times.
[02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:41.531]  I mean, Paul, this isn't coming.
[02:09:41.611 --> 02:09:42.291]  It's here, brother.
[02:09:42.311 --> 02:09:44.211]  It's here now.
[02:09:44.552 --> 02:09:50.634]  And to look at these posters that the MAC police put out shows you how brazen they are in announcing it.
[02:09:51.674 --> 02:09:54.875]  They've got a poster which shows a receipt for a credit card refund.
[02:09:54.895 --> 02:09:57.056]  They say that is a potential sign of terrorism.
[02:09:57.697 --> 02:10:05.505]  So, you know, about 10 million British citizens became terrorist suspects on Boxing Day when they got refunds for unwanted Christmas gifts.
[02:10:06.326 --> 02:10:16.456]  And they must know that, you know, if there's any real terrorists out there, ones that aren't on the payroll of MI6, like our friend ASWAT, the London bombing mastermind,
[02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:24.966]  That, you know, something like this would only create more noise in the system, allowing any real terrorist to evade any detection, and they must know that.
[02:10:25.466 --> 02:10:29.528]  So, in effect, they're creating the terrorist cadre that don't exist.
[02:10:29.608 --> 02:10:35.351]  By the way, I've had on about... Exactly, I've had on about protecting the terrorists, you're right, who are their officers.
[02:10:35.591 --> 02:10:44.296]  I have had on what four high-level CIA officers in the last month, they've all said, these local tattletale squads, like they're doing in Knoxville, Tennessee and London, England,
[02:10:44.997 --> 02:10:48.383]  Are the opposite of what will keep us safe if the terror threat was real.
[02:10:48.803 --> 02:10:50.747]  I mean, that's 101 what you just said, Paul.
[02:10:51.167 --> 02:10:55.375]  But you can't tell that to these cops and the general public, who frankly are as dumb as dirt.
[02:10:56.258 --> 02:10:58.459]  Well, yeah, and they get power out of it.
[02:10:58.499 --> 02:11:03.641]  They get to exercise their little Hitler ego trips when they search your bags and stuff like that.
[02:11:03.761 --> 02:11:06.362]  And you read this, it says, crime is terror.
[02:11:06.382 --> 02:11:10.163]  There's not going to be any real terrorists with millions of people watching CCTs.
[02:11:10.783 --> 02:11:11.683]  No, TVs.
[02:11:12.024 --> 02:11:13.724]  No, I mean, this is about total control.
[02:11:13.764 --> 02:11:20.627]  And by the way, they passed the new law there where if you drop some trash, you can go to jail and be charged thousands of pounds.
[02:11:20.667 --> 02:11:21.127]  And guess what?
[02:11:21.187 --> 02:11:24.308]  Blair's saying, if you do this now, they'll take your house.
[02:11:24.848 --> 02:11:29.071]  Yes, it's in the news today, now for petty crimes that government will take your house.
[02:11:29.792 --> 02:11:35.916]  Yeah, they've got people who frog march you to a cash machine if you drop a piece of gum, if you don't immediately pay the fine.
[02:11:36.777 --> 02:11:42.421]  You get arrested, and now the law's coming in Britain where any offense whatsoever is immediately arrestable.
[02:11:42.781 --> 02:11:46.984]  And again, we heard this five years ago when Blair said, I want to get rid of juries, they're bad!
[02:11:47.324 --> 02:11:49.005]  And now they're starting to do it!
[02:11:50.506 --> 02:11:50.926]  And with this
[02:11:52.401 --> 02:12:02.267]  Surveillance Grid and the Stasi campaign, they're kind of shifting the surveillance grid into areas where it's not mechanized, so it becomes self-regulating.
[02:12:02.627 --> 02:12:12.572]  Because if you pound it into people that everything they're doing is constantly being monitored, which is obviously part of the motivation behind this NSA spying scandal.
[02:12:12.592 --> 02:12:13.753]  It's called the Panopticon.
[02:12:13.773 --> 02:12:15.614]  It's called self-censorship, chilling effect.
[02:12:16.414 --> 02:12:18.075]  Yeah, so I've pounded it into people.
[02:12:18.095 --> 02:12:24.860]  They're trying to make people regulate their own behaviour and have, you know, absolutely no confidence to exercise their innate freedoms.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:33.026]  For example, I get emails from people asking if they subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv, will they get put on a list?
[02:12:33.206 --> 02:12:35.608]  Will they get a visit from Homeland Security?
[02:12:36.388 --> 02:12:38.889]  That's how deep it penetrates.
[02:12:38.909 --> 02:12:44.613]  I know a lot of people who say, you're making this stuff up, but I don't want to talk to you because I'll be put on a list.
[02:12:44.653 --> 02:12:45.633]  And I go, now which is it?
[02:12:45.913 --> 02:12:48.755]  We're not living under Big Brother, but you're afraid of being put on a list.
[02:12:48.795 --> 02:12:51.316]  Folks, who cares if you're on a list?
[02:12:51.336 --> 02:12:52.157]  Let me tell you the truth.
[02:12:52.557 --> 02:13:02.943]  I have congressmen on, I have Bush, Reagan, Bush Sr., major former officials on, saying the government's terrorist, it's carrying out terror attacks, and it's going to kill us.
[02:13:03.423 --> 02:13:06.564]  Okay, I mean, look, they're people who weren't saying this a few years ago.
[02:13:06.784 --> 02:13:08.105]  It's because they see what we see.
[02:13:08.545 --> 02:13:10.306]  Okay, we're the good guys.
[02:13:10.326 --> 02:13:13.527]  If we roll over now, then you need to be afraid.
[02:13:13.627 --> 02:13:15.328]  This whole thing is to abuse us all.
[02:13:15.708 --> 02:13:17.469]  If you serve them, they'll abuse you.
[02:13:17.749 --> 02:13:21.651]  It's actually when you fight them, it's like a lion leaving an elephant alone.
[02:13:21.711 --> 02:13:24.632]  It goes after a kit-kit, or it goes after a gazelle.
[02:13:25.052 --> 02:13:27.813]  It goes after some little bug-eyed creature that's defenseless.
[02:13:28.113 --> 02:13:29.194]  It doesn't go after some
[02:13:30.814 --> 02:13:31.274]  Elephant!
[02:13:31.535 --> 02:13:34.316]  So stop acting like a bunch of little cowardly jellyfish!
[02:13:35.016 --> 02:13:45.280]  And no, folks, PrisonPlanet.tv, now I've been offered money before, but it's always, you know, like ten years ago, give money to Pat Buchanan, and now I'm on every mailing list you can imagine of conservative groups.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:48.161]  No, we don't sell names, we don't do anything with it.
[02:13:48.502 --> 02:13:50.502]  In fact, after a year, it gets shredded.
[02:13:50.863 --> 02:13:53.764]  So no, we do not sell names to answer that question.
[02:13:53.984 --> 02:13:57.785]  But already, dum-dums, and I don't mean to be mean about it, but come on, folks.
[02:13:57.805 --> 02:13:59.126]  I'm talking to those particular people.
[02:14:00.174 --> 02:14:03.357]  Already on the net with cookies, everything's being tracked to begin with.
[02:14:03.417 --> 02:14:04.638]  That's the whole point.
[02:14:05.018 --> 02:14:05.979]  That's the whole point.
[02:14:06.039 --> 02:14:06.900]  It's out of control.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:07.580]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:18.890]  Yeah, and for the elite, you know, that self-regulatory little brother syndrome, as opposed to big brother watching everybody, it's going to be more successful for them because
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:26.783]  A dictatorship by fiat rather than force is something that's far easier for them to package and sell to the wider population.
[02:14:26.923 --> 02:14:27.844]  Well, here's an example.
[02:14:28.524 --> 02:14:33.526]  There's a big article out today, actually several, about that Rupert Murdoch bought Myspace with his 36 million members.
[02:14:34.378 --> 02:14:58.305]  And you could go on there and say whatever you wanted and do whatever you wanted to share information, and so the pig demon, the person who puts out the dirtiest, rottenest TV to corrupt everybody, who then you call Christian conservative, Rupert's slimeball maggot-head Murdoch, phony conservative propagandist, worms his way over and buys MySpace, and now it's not just hundreds of things, thousands of things.
[02:14:58.765 --> 02:14:59.866]  I mean, I told you, it's easy.
[02:15:00.806 --> 02:15:09.813]  News Corp admits, that's who owns Fox, News Corp admits that you post anything about their competitors, anything else, it's automatically deleted.
[02:15:10.033 --> 02:15:11.474]  You see, there's your free speech.
[02:15:12.695 --> 02:15:14.696]  And this is why there's a push for internet too.
[02:15:15.217 --> 02:15:28.947]  Because in the sphere of the internet, they have got those mechanized systems where, for example, Microsoft have keyword logging for all emails, which led them to alert the Chinese government to shut down this blogger.
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:32.262]  Which they've done on several other occasions in the past.
[02:15:33.022 --> 02:15:34.543]  And what were these bloggers doing?
[02:15:34.604 --> 02:15:37.566]  Criticizing how their neighbor was forced to have an abortion.
[02:15:38.246 --> 02:15:39.847]  Oh, look, we better shut them down!
[02:15:40.948 --> 02:15:44.110]  Yeah, and Declan McCullers got an article out today.
[02:15:45.391 --> 02:15:48.333]  Annoying someone on the internet is a federal crime.
[02:15:48.393 --> 02:15:50.655]  That's right, CNN News, mainstream.
[02:15:50.995 --> 02:15:51.915]  Tell us about that, Paul.
[02:15:53.076 --> 02:15:57.079]  Yeah, it was passed by Pork Barrel, as they always do, in a different bill.
[02:15:59.005 --> 02:16:13.049]  If you annoy someone on the internet, the language is so vague and ambiguous it could be anything, then it's two years in jail and a fine, which is obviously going to target political email lists as nuisances or any kind of boycott or lobbying.
[02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:14.830]  Now again, that's total First Amendment.
[02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:24.433]  No one believed that the McCain-Feingold bill that says six weeks before an election, I can't have gun owners of America on, or Nature Conservancy, but now Bush
[02:16:25.633 --> 02:16:34.978]  Yeah, and then stuff like, you know, can spam law.
[02:16:35.578 --> 02:16:38.760]  I still, I get more amount of spam now since they passed that law.
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:39.720]  Who does it target?
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:49.305]  It's always people who send out mass emails and, you know, those people who get accused of paper terrorism and stuff like that by trying to lobby people in government or
[02:16:50.095 --> 02:16:58.480]  It's all going to be selectively enforced and then when the British government or the US government sells your data to known criminals on purpose, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:16:59.541 --> 02:17:10.167]  Well yeah, they actually said that they're going to fund the British ID card by selling all your personal information to big companies so they could spam you with offers of credit cards, etc.
[02:17:10.827 --> 02:17:18.992]  So they brought it in under the guise of protecting your information and identity theft and the very first step that they take to fund it does exactly that.
[02:17:20.379 --> 02:17:24.362]  Well, we got the audio clip, the radio ad in England about how to keep safe.
[02:17:24.843 --> 02:17:25.723]  Look for people.
[02:17:25.943 --> 02:17:28.245]  Do you want to continue living an enjoyable life?
[02:17:28.505 --> 02:17:33.109]  Become a member of Big Brother's Stasi and bring down the East Asians.
[02:17:33.549 --> 02:17:35.911]  We've always been at war with East Asia.
[02:17:36.372 --> 02:17:40.335]  Now, Morpho Missile Production and Chaka Rations are up by 2,971%.
[02:17:40.395 --> 02:17:40.815]  BB reports 6,795.
[02:17:46.394 --> 02:17:49.657]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:49.737 --> 02:17:53.900]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:56.942]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:57.142 --> 02:17:59.544]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:59.724 --> 02:18:08.371]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:08.571 --> 02:18:09.932]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:18:10.112 --> 02:18:14.275]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:14.515 --> 02:18:15.035]  We're good to go!
[02:18:33.524 --> 02:18:35.285]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:35.465 --> 02:18:37.086]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:18:37.106 --> 02:18:41.047]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:18:59.324 --> 02:19:04.248]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:19:05.328 --> 02:19:07.150]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:19:07.530 --> 02:19:08.351]  There may be more.

[02:21:55.615 --> 02:22:07.210]  Silverstein and Pohl, thanks to a listener, dug up the fact that they covertly put out a little press report through the State Department of all places trying to explain away why they said that they blew up Building 7.
[02:22:08.826 --> 02:22:09.426]  So that's coming up.
[02:22:09.446 --> 02:22:11.267]  But Paul, let's roll this ad now.
[02:22:11.347 --> 02:22:12.767]  Set up this radio ad for us.
[02:22:13.507 --> 02:22:20.469]  This goes along with the billboard ads that say, safe under the watchful eyes, with like a big brother all-seeing eye looking down on the buses.
[02:22:20.949 --> 02:22:23.189]  And then a year later, the buses and the trains get bombed.
[02:22:23.229 --> 02:22:25.730]  So, just kind of an in-your-face situation.
[02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:32.912]  Now they have these new ads, TV, radio, print, report your neighbors, watch for everything, everything's terrorism.
[02:22:33.212 --> 02:22:34.652]  Set up this ad we're about to hear, Paul.
[02:22:35.635 --> 02:22:42.358]  Well yeah, before the bombings they had a stardew campaign on trains saying you should report suspicious behaviour on trains.
[02:22:43.178 --> 02:22:54.442]  And now last week Metropolitan Police and the government launched this campaign which encourages reporting your neighbours, reporting people who own a vehicle or get a credit card refund.
[02:22:54.462 --> 02:22:57.303]  So it's basically anything that is potential terrorism.
[02:22:57.423 --> 02:23:04.026]  And they're just training us, then in two years it'll be report anybody who doesn't submit to the government, who doesn't like what we're doing and then they just disappear.
[02:23:05.208 --> 02:23:06.172]  Yep, that's the plan.
[02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:09.968]  Let's go ahead and roll this loving ad.
[02:23:10.008 --> 02:23:10.410]  Here it is.
[02:23:11.807 --> 02:23:13.408]  You are someone who lives in London.
[02:23:13.548 --> 02:23:16.149]  Someone who takes the tube, gets the bus, hails a cab.
[02:23:16.229 --> 02:23:19.550]  You're someone who stands on the right, holds open doors, smiles at strangers.
[02:23:19.770 --> 02:23:23.352]  You're someone with a partner, friends and family, mates and colleagues.
[02:23:23.572 --> 02:23:28.214]  You are someone with hopes and fears, ambitions and dreams, a past and a future.
[02:23:28.614 --> 02:23:35.717]  And you are someone who knows that terrorists won't succeed, as long as someone calls the police to report anything suspicious.
[02:23:36.758 --> 02:23:37.238]  You are
[02:23:39.739 --> 02:23:44.441]  But if you see the tomb full of illegal aliens, don't worry about it.
[02:23:44.461 --> 02:23:49.423]  Tony Blair's made secret deals to legalise all of them, like Georgie Porgie Pudding Pie.
[02:23:49.443 --> 02:23:55.866]  That's right, he's been caught doing that with the Romanian government and others.
[02:24:10.569 --> 02:24:12.070]  Well, just listen to it.
[02:24:12.130 --> 02:24:12.951]  It's anything.
[02:24:13.591 --> 02:24:16.253]  How about breathing oxygen or eating food?
[02:24:16.434 --> 02:24:17.574]  Well, you've got a life.
[02:24:17.594 --> 02:24:21.417]  Listen, you've got a life and you're not going to have that life unless you start tattling on everyone.
[02:24:21.858 --> 02:24:25.681]  It just creates this foggy fear and the men in black uniforms are going to save you.
[02:24:25.701 --> 02:24:34.647]  Meanwhile, I'm out there bullhorning Parliament, totally legal, outlawed three days later, and they march over and try to physically start stopping me from speaking.
[02:24:36.088 --> 02:24:39.351]  Yeah, but just imagine if people took this to heart.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:48.843]  The amount of noise it would create, where you'd have people phoning 999 for anything, and people who wanted to get revenge on somebody they didn't like.
[02:24:48.863 --> 02:24:50.323]  But I'll tell you what this does.
[02:24:50.463 --> 02:24:51.664]  But I'll tell you what this does.
[02:24:51.744 --> 02:24:53.084]  It creates a chatter.
[02:24:53.104 --> 02:24:58.126]  The thousands of anti-terror drills they've had create the subconscious perception that the terror threat is real.
[02:24:58.166 --> 02:24:59.106]  They've got to do this.
[02:25:00.186 --> 02:25:01.427]  Yeah, they've charged
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:06.401]  They've had 500 terrorist suspects detained in Britain.
[02:25:06.841 --> 02:25:10.762]  They've only charged two of them, and that was on visa violation.
[02:25:10.782 --> 02:25:13.843]  By the way, we found publications from the 80s.
[02:25:13.903 --> 02:25:24.665]  It's admitted that they caught, this was big in the news when it happened, a Mossad agent with a team of six about to carry out bombings on buses and trains to blame it on the Muslims.
[02:25:25.606 --> 02:25:27.546]  Nice little tidbit we found, Paul.
[02:25:27.566 --> 02:25:30.007]  A little memory hole news we'd forgotten about.
[02:25:30.767 --> 02:25:31.187]  Exactly.
[02:25:32.558 --> 02:25:36.322]  Even not terrorism, anything that hate speech.
[02:25:36.582 --> 02:25:43.970]  There was a lady in Cambridge, which is just north of London, who wrote a book opposing gay adoption.
[02:25:44.370 --> 02:25:49.295]  She was doing a radio interview instead, very calmly, without threatening anybody.
[02:25:49.355 --> 02:25:54.320]  We don't give girls to two men, and we shouldn't adopt boys to two men, and they said, we may arrest you lady.
[02:25:54.941 --> 02:25:59.224]  Yeah, she got a phone call from the police and she said to them, well, have I broke any law?
[02:25:59.244 --> 02:26:01.046]  They said, no, we're just investigating.
[02:26:01.066 --> 02:26:04.388]  And, you know, she said, well, why don't you go out and catch some real criminals?
[02:26:04.408 --> 02:26:05.589]  Stop wasting my time.
[02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:08.311]  So, I mean, those are the real criminals now.
[02:26:08.771 --> 02:26:12.434]  Authors and people who live in houses and own vehicles.
[02:26:13.576 --> 02:26:17.238]  People who have been by the lake in London could be terrorists.
[02:26:17.298 --> 02:26:21.861]  These posters... Tyranny is put in place to take land and take property and enslave people.
[02:26:22.361 --> 02:26:25.303]  And you can bet your bottom dollar because all the economic indices show this.
[02:26:25.323 --> 02:26:28.865]  You know, that's a big news story last week that China is now going to move away from the dollar.
[02:26:29.385 --> 02:26:31.726]  And then the average public has no idea what that means, Paul.
[02:26:32.687 --> 02:26:34.007]  Well, the economy's great.
[02:26:34.187 --> 02:26:35.548]  It's improving all the time.
[02:26:35.568 --> 02:26:36.289]  They believe it.
[02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:37.389]  And that's the end of the story.
[02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.750]  Doesn't matter.
[02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:42.152]  Every major index and indice shows the opposite, Paul.
[02:26:42.987 --> 02:26:43.447]  Exactly.
[02:26:44.368 --> 02:26:45.549]  We're just being negative, Paul.
[02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:52.793]  I guess, you know, I want to come back and talk about the Bush administration officials saying they can torture people's children in front of them and crush their genitalia.
[02:26:53.954 --> 02:26:55.575]  Do you think we ought to talk about that when we get back, Paul?
[02:26:56.656 --> 02:27:00.138]  Yeah, because I wrote an article last week saying, what's next?
[02:27:00.498 --> 02:27:02.279]  Advocating torturing children.
[02:27:02.399 --> 02:27:03.520]  You know, we've already seen it in 24.
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:05.981]  With Bunsen burners, you said, yeah?
[02:27:06.582 --> 02:27:08.563]  Yeah, and it came out yesterday.
[02:27:09.853 --> 02:27:12.695]  You see, it was worse than what you thought they'd do, see?
[02:27:12.735 --> 02:27:13.015]  Yeah.
[02:27:13.176 --> 02:27:14.336]  It's always worse.
[02:27:15.237 --> 02:27:20.001]  And there's actually weirdos right now going, yeah, killing, torturing children's good, huh?
[02:27:20.401 --> 02:27:22.502]  That's what America's all about.
[02:27:22.983 --> 02:27:25.905]  What's wrong with that Paul guy on there?
[02:27:25.925 --> 02:27:28.847]  We need to torture children.
[02:27:28.907 --> 02:27:33.611]  That's what freedom's about, and that's what we, that's what Jesus would do.
[02:27:36.664 --> 02:27:37.585]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.045 --> 02:27:39.726]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.587 --> 02:27:43.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:05.558 --> 02:29:09.001]  So effective you can drink raw untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.

[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.902]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:29:51.082 --> 02:29:56.465]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:29:56.705 --> 02:29:58.226]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:29:58.266 --> 02:30:00.508]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:30:00.688 --> 02:30:04.250]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:30:04.770 --> 02:30:05.250]  We're good to go.

[02:30:59.072 --> 02:30:59.972]  Central Standard Time.
[02:30:59.992 --> 02:31:01.153]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:31:01.554 --> 02:31:03.215]  Paul Watson riding shotgun with us.
[02:31:03.275 --> 02:31:04.015]  A ton of news.
[02:31:04.036 --> 02:31:06.898]  We want to cover a couple different audio clips as well.
[02:31:08.018 --> 02:31:18.162]  Before we go any further, though, if you want to spend a lot of money and get hazardous, toxic, poisonous chemicals for cleaning, that's your business.
[02:31:18.222 --> 02:31:30.867]  If you want to save lots of money and get safe, earth-friendly, pure soaps made out of vegetables and fruits for your health and cleanliness, then that's my business, and that's the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[02:31:31.727 --> 02:31:35.909]  Folks, I've been using them for almost two years, and my wife's like, why don't you get them as a sponsor?
[02:31:36.852 --> 02:31:38.073]  Oh yeah, this stuff's incredible.
[02:31:38.633 --> 02:31:45.078]  It's just made out of coconuts and made out of vegetables and there's no beef tallow, there's no toxins.
[02:31:45.638 --> 02:31:47.019]  It doesn't eat holes in your clothes.
[02:31:47.079 --> 02:31:47.960]  It's so good.
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:53.323]  Anytime we run out of it and use other even mild detergents, my kids get rashes and stuff on them.
[02:31:53.643 --> 02:31:54.644]  It dries their skin out.
[02:31:54.684 --> 02:31:57.026]  It eats through your clothes.
[02:31:57.726 --> 02:31:59.828]  Believe me folks, it's so toxic.
[02:31:59.968 --> 02:32:00.388]  Why?
[02:32:00.408 --> 02:32:00.468]  Why?
[02:32:00.628 --> 02:32:00.988]  Why?
[02:32:02.947 --> 02:32:06.292]  And as usual, getting something non-toxic that's great saves you money.
[02:32:06.312 --> 02:32:07.874]  85% off.
[02:32:09.916 --> 02:32:13.741]  That's how much you'll save with this stuff, because it's triple concentrated.
[02:32:13.801 --> 02:32:18.307]  You need to go to Calbin Pure Soap, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:18.688 --> 02:32:21.151]  You need to go to their website.
[02:32:21.918 --> 02:32:26.400]  And you need to get the materials and you need to use them.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:31.983]  We have a big banner up on InfoWars.com at CalBenPureSub.com.
[02:32:32.003 --> 02:32:36.305]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N PureSub.com or just go to InfoWars.com on the left hand side.
[02:32:36.585 --> 02:32:41.227]  There's a link to it and Paul Watson is going to be putting a link up on PresidentPlanet.com as well.
[02:32:41.287 --> 02:32:43.969]  It's a made in America company right out in Oakland, California.
[02:32:44.689 --> 02:32:47.090]  It is a now 57 year business.
[02:32:49.358 --> 02:32:53.501]  Some of the old ads you run on the network, because the network's had them for a sponsor for a while, say 50 years.
[02:32:53.541 --> 02:33:03.009]  It's now 57 years, family owned, and you save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[02:33:03.049 --> 02:33:05.511]  Call today for a Calbin Pure Soap catalog.
[02:33:06.298 --> 02:33:07.058]  At 1-800-340-7091.
[02:33:07.079 --> 02:33:20.426]  And they've got some starter packs where they send you out, you know, some laundry soap, dish soap, bath soap, shampoo, for just about the cost of two bottles of, you know, maybe a bottle of detergent and a bottle of shampoo.
[02:33:20.446 --> 02:33:21.546]  You get like five or six things.
[02:33:21.566 --> 02:33:23.367]  This is like half off.
[02:33:23.407 --> 02:33:24.167]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:33:24.768 --> 02:33:25.308]  Give them a call.
[02:33:25.328 --> 02:33:25.368]  800-340-7091.
[02:33:25.388 --> 02:33:27.549]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get that.
[02:33:27.669 --> 02:33:28.270]  Get a free catalog.
[02:33:28.290 --> 02:33:28.950]  800-340-7091 or calvinpearsoap.com.
[02:33:35.396 --> 02:33:38.777]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:33:38.897 --> 02:33:45.079]  You know, at the Whole Foods, at the Central Market, we still buy some other citrus and vegetable-based stuff.
[02:33:45.119 --> 02:33:45.759]  It's pretty good.
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:48.200]  But it's not as concentrated.
[02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:49.500]  It's not triple concentrated.
[02:33:50.241 --> 02:33:52.201]  So, you know, we have quite a few things in the house.
[02:33:52.221 --> 02:33:53.762]  We do not use the toxic chemicals.
[02:33:53.982 --> 02:33:54.882]  And it's good.
[02:33:54.902 --> 02:33:56.522]  You walk in, you smell the cleaning stuff.
[02:33:56.582 --> 02:33:57.803]  It gets it clean even better.
[02:33:57.823 --> 02:33:59.403]  It doesn't make your head spin.
[02:33:59.903 --> 02:34:01.364]  I mean, who wants to be around that stuff?
[02:34:04.603 --> 02:34:08.225]  Just take sodium lauryl sulfate, the number one ingredient in shampoo.
[02:34:08.386 --> 02:34:10.507]  A known carcinogen, a known toxin.
[02:34:10.527 --> 02:34:12.448]  They have allowable levels of all of this.
[02:34:12.908 --> 02:34:14.289]  I hate to harp all day, folks.
[02:34:14.369 --> 02:34:19.273]  I just don't know how you support Procter & Gamble with all the pentagrams on their products anyways.
[02:34:19.293 --> 02:34:20.894]  I mean, it just sounds crazy.
[02:34:20.934 --> 02:34:22.234]  Go look on the back of it.
[02:34:24.076 --> 02:34:27.318]  You know, this is the craziness of all of this stuff.
[02:34:27.378 --> 02:34:29.159]  It's a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.141]  And so give Calvin Pierce a call.
[02:34:33.212 --> 02:34:45.656]  And before we go back to Paul Watson, we have a lot of new specials and quite frankly today I haven't printed them off the website so I don't have them in front of me, but we got rid of the specials from last year and we have the new specials for this year that are excellent.
[02:34:47.692 --> 02:34:52.373]  And we have the good old-fashioned special we have before the year-end special for three months free.
[02:34:52.393 --> 02:35:03.475]  You don't get 5.3 months free, but you get three months free when you get a yearly subscription to PrisonPlanet.tv with my weekly TV reports, a weekly video shoot inside my radio studio with in-studio guests.
[02:35:03.855 --> 02:35:05.356]  Coming up, it's going to be Tex Mars.
[02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:11.057]  And we're going to have Mr. Stahl, who's running for state senate, fighting the trans-Texas NAFTA corridor grid.
[02:35:11.337 --> 02:35:12.457]  He'll be in studio Friday.
[02:35:12.477 --> 02:35:13.317]  That'll be up on the site.
[02:35:13.717 --> 02:35:16.998]  Our interview with McNairick of last Friday, that'll be up tomorrow.
[02:35:17.991 --> 02:35:25.833]  Uh... for PrisonPlanet.tv members, all my films, my book, my watchlist book, all my best audio interviews, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:25.893 --> 02:35:32.195]  Fifteen cents a day, and coming up in about two months, it'll be the two-year anniversary of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:32.255 --> 02:35:36.616]  So there are two years of material up there, but really there's about ten years of material up there.
[02:35:36.636 --> 02:35:39.117]  All my work in the last ten years, the best stuff we've done.
[02:35:40.359 --> 02:35:41.600]  And it's a great activist center.
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:50.546]  You can download all my videos, download copies of Paul's book, my book, put it on disk, print out hard copies of it, put it in a folder, give it as a gift, you know, spiral bound folder.
[02:35:51.427 --> 02:35:55.089]  You can download the TV shows, burn them to disk, give them to people.
[02:35:55.610 --> 02:35:59.672]  An amazing, an amazing activist tool.
[02:36:00.733 --> 02:36:03.095]  In fact, the high bandwidth quality versions are pretty good.
[02:36:03.115 --> 02:36:05.076]  You can even air those on local access TV if you wanted to.
[02:36:05.096 --> 02:36:07.758]  Just burn copies right there to your disk and go put that on.
[02:36:09.108 --> 02:36:13.995]  It is such an amazing tool, so use PrisonPlanet.TV as an activist tool.
[02:36:14.997 --> 02:36:16.078]  Very, very exciting.
[02:36:16.098 --> 02:36:24.911]  And we grow, we affect change, we get the word out because you give people information about PrisonPlanet.TV, because you tell folks about InfoWars.com.
[02:36:25.675 --> 02:36:31.478]  We have a whole video and bookstore expanding t-shirts and videos and books we're carrying up on InfoWars.com.
[02:36:31.498 --> 02:36:36.961]  Go order hard copies of DVD or VHS or t-shirts off of InfoWars.com.
[02:36:37.001 --> 02:36:40.783]  That is the main engine, that shopping cart there that funds what we're doing.
[02:36:40.803 --> 02:36:41.684]  We're hiring more people.
[02:36:41.704 --> 02:36:42.324]  We're expanding.
[02:36:42.344 --> 02:36:43.184]  We're moving forward.
[02:36:43.605 --> 02:36:45.866]  We're going to intensify our war against the New World Order.
[02:36:46.926 --> 02:36:48.547]  It's a great harvest right now.
[02:36:48.627 --> 02:36:51.588]  People are really waking up because it's all out in the open now.
[02:36:51.628 --> 02:36:53.309]  People go, man, Alex said that ten years ago.
[02:36:53.329 --> 02:36:54.290]  He said that five years ago.
[02:36:54.690 --> 02:36:56.431]  Station owners, you had me on as a guest.
[02:36:56.471 --> 02:36:57.331]  I mean, every week they call.
[02:36:57.531 --> 02:36:58.271]  I'm putting you on.
[02:36:58.491 --> 02:36:59.652]  I didn't believe you five years ago.
[02:36:59.672 --> 02:37:00.592]  I had you on as a guest.
[02:37:00.632 --> 02:37:01.253]  It's all true.
[02:37:01.273 --> 02:37:04.914]  You know, my nephew got raided by the police and they said, we don't need a warrant.
[02:37:04.934 --> 02:37:08.676]  You know, it's... See, the tyranny is getting so bad now.
[02:37:09.156 --> 02:37:12.418]  That it's happening and we're standing up like Americans always do.
[02:37:12.718 --> 02:37:13.619]  The Sleeping Giant.
[02:37:13.659 --> 02:37:14.719]  But it doesn't mean we're winning.
[02:37:14.759 --> 02:37:15.820]  The battle is joined.
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:17.641]  We're in this match right now.
[02:37:17.701 --> 02:37:18.442]  We haven't won it.
[02:37:19.682 --> 02:37:23.725]  So, InfoWars.com to order via the SafeSecure shopping cart or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:37:23.745 --> 02:37:25.225]  That's 1-888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:39.179 --> 02:37:40.500]  Take action, call now.
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:46.585]  You can also write to me at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:37:46.725 --> 02:37:50.387]  Everybody tells me I talk too fast.
[02:37:50.427 --> 02:37:56.572]  It's 3001, it's South Lamar, it's Suite 100, it's Austin, Texas, it's 787-04.
[02:37:56.992 --> 02:37:59.574]  Paul Watson, I want to get into the news and play a couple of audio clips here.
[02:37:59.594 --> 02:38:00.695]  We're always honored to have you.
[02:38:01.716 --> 02:38:06.239]  But tell us about some of the things we've been adding to PrisonPlanet.tv, then I want to get into Larry Silverstein.
[02:38:07.603 --> 02:38:11.308]  Well, there's already a whole library there, which is now nearly two years old.
[02:38:12.189 --> 02:38:14.732]  Dozens of, um, weekly video reports.
[02:38:15.253 --> 02:38:16.434]  All your documentary films.
[02:38:16.474 --> 02:38:16.955]  Dozens?
[02:38:16.995 --> 02:38:18.376]  It's gotta be like a hundred, Paul.
[02:38:19.478 --> 02:38:19.878]  Well, yeah.
[02:38:20.119 --> 02:38:20.559]  Many dozens.
[02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:23.911]  We purge the information.
[02:38:24.531 --> 02:38:30.893]  If you want to let your account expire, basically you can sign up for $5.95, download everything you want and then cancel.
[02:38:31.373 --> 02:38:32.893]  We give people the option to do that.
[02:38:33.493 --> 02:38:36.514]  All the information gets purged after a matter of days.
[02:38:36.774 --> 02:38:39.075]  So we don't sell the information or anything like that.
[02:38:39.855 --> 02:38:41.015]  So it's all secure.
[02:38:41.115 --> 02:38:42.856]  We accept PayPal, credit card.
[02:38:43.296 --> 02:38:46.397]  We accept checks and money orders.
[02:38:46.497 --> 02:38:48.878]  Just send them to the address which is on the website.
[02:38:51.118 --> 02:38:52.579]  You know, the bandwidth's great now.
[02:38:52.639 --> 02:38:57.402]  The videos download the highest possible speed you can imagine.
[02:38:57.422 --> 02:39:14.654]  I mean, I can download videos faster than some, you know, big websites like Yahoo or Hotmail or whatever at higher speeds, so... Yeah, it was slowing down during peak times because everybody's been sharing their passcodes, but now we've got a just really smoking pipe in servers.
[02:39:15.095 --> 02:39:18.437]  And so, yeah, and if it slows down again, we'll upgrade again, folks.
[02:39:19.688 --> 02:39:23.989]  It's not like, you know, AOL or something where they're just ripping everybody off and nobody can get online.
[02:39:25.250 --> 02:39:27.030]  Meanwhile, saying the internet's bad anyway.
[02:39:30.291 --> 02:39:37.954]  Larry Silverstein, I got a couple of clips I want to play, Paul, but Larry Silverstein, they finally responded to, I mean, go through that great article you put together.
[02:39:39.119 --> 02:39:43.344]  Well, yeah, it's been floating around the internet for a few months, but nobody picked up on it.
[02:39:43.884 --> 02:39:57.019]  And I'm quite frustrated that this story wasn't bigger, because it answered a lot of the questions that people had about what Silverstein meant when he said, we pulled Building 7 on that PBS documentary.
[02:39:57.905 --> 02:40:17.398]  And the answer, as you said, comes through the State Department website in their 9-11 debunking section, which also says that organ harvesting from executed Chinese prisoners is a conspiracy theory, even though it's admitted on their own website in a different area.
[02:40:17.558 --> 02:40:21.961]  And it's, you know, it's been in every major newspaper you can mention for the past 5-10 years.
[02:40:23.388 --> 02:40:25.469]  The Chinese government advertises it.
[02:40:25.529 --> 02:40:28.931]  It's not like, you know, it's like saying Ford Motors doesn't exist.
[02:40:29.611 --> 02:40:34.994]  Yeah, it's like saying the government putting mercury in vaccines is a conspiracy theory.
[02:40:35.034 --> 02:40:35.754]  It's admitted.
[02:40:37.315 --> 02:40:50.761]  But Phil Steen said through his spokesperson that he meant that he was referring to evacuating firefighters from the building when he said, we pulled the building.
[02:40:51.846 --> 02:41:00.595]  Which doesn't correlate with the facts, because three separate official reports say that there were no firefighters in the building.
[02:41:00.615 --> 02:41:00.916]  Never!
[02:41:00.936 --> 02:41:01.797]  It was never fought!
[02:41:01.817 --> 02:41:11.547]  No, the FEMA report... Then they say that no one died in it, though a Secret Service agent did, and now this police detective who died was actually somebody who was in there and barely got out as it collapsed.
[02:41:12.876 --> 02:41:13.116]  Yeah.
[02:41:13.156 --> 02:41:14.918]  Plus we have the squibs going off the building.
[02:41:14.958 --> 02:41:18.480]  He says, we gave the order to watch it come down, and then it came down.
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:21.482]  Then on the same documentary they say, pull it means destroy a building.
[02:41:21.722 --> 02:41:22.803]  I mean, how simple is that?
[02:41:23.503 --> 02:41:23.904]  Well, yeah.
[02:41:24.024 --> 02:41:30.508]  FEMA report says no manual firefighting operations were taken by the FDNY in relation to building 7.
[02:41:30.568 --> 02:41:31.889]  Local NPR reported that day.
[02:41:31.929 --> 02:41:34.131]  The government may blow the building up to keep others safe.
[02:41:34.411 --> 02:41:36.933]  The building fell into a perfect little demolition pile.
[02:41:37.887 --> 02:41:50.412]  Yeah, and even Popular Mechanics' debunking piece had the quote from NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology, as saying there was no, quote, there was no firefighting in WTC7.
[02:41:50.552 --> 02:41:51.572]  They also say that...
[02:41:52.441 --> 02:42:07.191]  North Tower fell and knocked out the central column, but their own debris field, they admit that the building never hit Building 7, that some dust did, and that the main support falls one second before the rest of the building falls at 5.30 in the afternoon.
[02:42:07.231 --> 02:42:13.715]  I mean, it's publicly admitted that the North Tower didn't hit it, but they just make it up and say it did now!
[02:42:14.395 --> 02:42:17.797]  Well, just look at the video, North Tower collapsing.
[02:42:18.138 --> 02:42:20.119]  At the very least, it's hit by some dust.
[02:42:20.788 --> 02:42:29.413]  That building basically turns into dust seconds after it starts to collapse because of the volume of explosives that must have been in there.
[02:42:29.913 --> 02:42:44.442]  So, under no explanation can you say that the amount of... That we have demolition professors, we have demolition physicists who look at it and they go, look, it's a classic, there are the blast points, we've got the squibs, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:42:44.482 --> 02:42:46.843]  I mean, you see the bombs going off!
[02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:50.045]  Yeah, three steel buildings, um,
[02:42:50.629 --> 02:42:55.311]  The first in history and the only in history to collapse from fire damage, all in the same day.
[02:42:57.211 --> 02:43:10.876]  But the point is, is that Silverstein has now changed his story as well, because earlier he just supposedly told a New York Post reporter that it was for some other reason, and I mean, now they're just in overdrive spin.
[02:43:10.916 --> 02:43:13.256]  I mean, it's just, it's not going to work.
[02:43:14.457 --> 02:43:18.338]  Well, now they're tripping over their own tongues, I mean, in one debunking piece.
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:20.565]  You know, it'll contradict still the Steve.
[02:43:22.688 --> 02:43:32.997]  There's a danger that debating all day what he meant when he said that clouds the fact that it's so blatantly obvious that the building was professionally demolished.
[02:43:33.017 --> 02:43:39.062]  It doesn't matter what Silverstein says happened and what definition you can get out of that.
[02:43:39.082 --> 02:43:40.243]  The evidence is there.
[02:43:40.263 --> 02:43:47.089]  The squibs, you know, the people in the lower levels, also in the Trade Towers saying that bombs were going off.
[02:43:47.310 --> 02:43:48.611]  The firefighters saying it.
[02:43:49.315 --> 02:43:54.618]  And by the way, they've now released a bunch of other firefighter tapes they claim were destroyed, but it turns out that under national security, they'd hid them.
[02:43:55.058 --> 02:43:58.660]  And on all the tapes, the firefighters are saying, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs!
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:06.744]  I mean, go and read any recount of September 11th, where they talk to people on the street, anyone who was in the building.
[02:44:07.304 --> 02:44:10.426]  Invariably, in nearly every one, you'll see mentions of bombs.
[02:44:11.046 --> 02:44:13.127]  It was as if they had detonated!
[02:44:13.207 --> 02:44:14.388]  Boom, boom, boom!
[02:44:15.228 --> 02:44:17.169]  Exactly, so... I mean, what do firefighters know?
[02:44:18.977 --> 02:44:29.165]  And to my knowledge, nobody's taken up that one million dollar challenge to prove that the building collapsed from fire damage caused by falling debris alone.
[02:44:29.225 --> 02:44:34.549]  Well, UL National Underwriters, the biggest group in the country, did their own internal test.
[02:44:34.829 --> 02:44:40.293]  When their chief engineer went public and said it's all a fraud, fire won't do that, they fired Kevin Ryan.
[02:44:40.734 --> 02:44:43.636]  And I mean, now there's all these other demolition experts going public?
[02:44:43.656 --> 02:44:44.797]  I mean, it's just not true!
[02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:47.231]  Exactly.
[02:44:47.451 --> 02:44:55.303]  You've got so many credible individuals coming out and saying the same thing that it's getting to the level where they could come out and say
[02:44:56.198 --> 02:45:05.362]  Because they had reports put out where these hijackers, government agents, whatever you want to call them, were seen in the Trade Towers before the attack.
[02:45:05.722 --> 02:45:14.146]  So they could come out and say that Al-Qaeda wired the building with bombs, if it gets to the level where public climate is so accepted.
[02:45:14.386 --> 02:45:15.667]  That's something that would take months.
[02:45:15.767 --> 02:45:19.689]  I mean, it takes months to do that, but of course the general public doesn't know that, so they'll probably believe it.
[02:45:20.882 --> 02:45:24.685]  I don't think they'll do that, but it's always, you know, it's a last resort.
[02:45:24.945 --> 02:45:27.647]  Well, that's what Vance tried to say when he debated me.
[02:45:28.267 --> 02:45:33.171]  He admitted that Silverstein said he blew it up, because it's public, and then said, oh, but it was Al-Qaeda that did it.
[02:45:34.912 --> 02:45:44.899]  I mean, it's just never, and you know, I want to play this clip, you talk about that comedy piece on Canadian TV, where it's a comedy TV show, but they're talking to real people on the street about mercury and the vaccines.
[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:47.141]  Go ahead and roll that mercury and vaccines clip.
[02:45:51.235 --> 02:45:56.358]  Health Canada says the best way to avoid the flu is vaccination, which in many provinces is free.
[02:45:56.879 --> 02:46:05.284]  Well, let's see if these recent flu shot recipients can help reveal the mystery of why Cheetos and Pop-Tarts list their ingredients while vaccines do their best not to.
[02:46:05.624 --> 02:46:07.245]  Are you aware of the ingredients in the vaccine?
[02:46:08.286 --> 02:46:10.207]  I know there's some egg products.
[02:46:10.575 --> 02:46:13.637]  I don't think they offered us a list of ingredients, so... That, no.
[02:46:13.737 --> 02:46:14.197]  I don't know.
[02:46:14.217 --> 02:46:15.258]  This is blind faith for me.
[02:46:15.478 --> 02:46:17.199]  Did you know that there's mercury in that shot?
[02:46:17.659 --> 02:46:18.139]  No, I didn't.
[02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:19.040]  Oh, I did not.
[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:19.380]  No.
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:20.521]  Are you glad that it's free?
[02:46:20.721 --> 02:46:20.921]  Yes.
[02:46:21.301 --> 02:46:22.362]  But you know it's not really free.
[02:46:22.822 --> 02:46:23.002]  Yes.
[02:46:23.662 --> 02:46:25.764]  Well, it's paying through our taxes, right?
[02:46:25.804 --> 02:46:28.125]  So... If I sneeze right now, would you be okay with that?
[02:46:29.426 --> 02:46:29.586]  No.
[02:46:32.187 --> 02:46:33.828]  These people confirmed two things.
[02:46:34.148 --> 02:46:38.671]  Some are happy to wait in line for a secret serum, and nobody likes getting sneezed on.
[02:46:40.307 --> 02:46:41.748]  Well, what if drug companies are right?
[02:46:41.889 --> 02:46:45.472]  What if tricking your body into thinking it's already sick doesn't make you sick?
[02:46:45.832 --> 02:46:47.654]  What if there's not enough vaccine to go around?
[02:46:48.315 --> 02:46:51.538]  You should know that making your own is easier than brewing your own beer.
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:54.981]  And it could save your life.
[02:46:55.701 --> 02:46:57.423]  Well, the first thing you need is a live virus.
[02:46:57.643 --> 02:46:59.265]  Is there anyone here suffering from the flu?
[02:47:03.173 --> 02:47:07.295]  Sir, would you favor us by discharging directly onto these chicken embryos?
[02:47:07.635 --> 02:47:09.655]  Maybe I could do that.
[02:47:09.855 --> 02:47:14.857]  Okay, we now have our chicken embryos and our live virus.
[02:47:15.938 --> 02:47:23.641]  Now from the pickled frog jar at your local school's biology class, we'll keep that virus dead like the drug companies do with formaldehyde.
[02:47:25.421 --> 02:47:27.422]  Now careful, don't get any frog in the mix.
[02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:29.072]  That'd be gross.
[02:47:31.133 --> 02:47:32.954]  Now, let's add a little ether.
[02:47:34.655 --> 02:47:35.796]  Careful, don't fall asleep.
[02:47:36.716 --> 02:47:38.217]  And then we dump some detergent in there.
[02:47:38.237 --> 02:47:40.099]  That keeps it clean.
[02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:47.143]  And remember when your mother lost her mind when you played with mercury because it never leaves your body?
[02:47:47.884 --> 02:47:49.204]  Well, that makes it a great preservative.
[02:47:50.005 --> 02:47:57.730]  If you have a thermometer... Staying healthy is a lot more important than room temperature.
[02:47:59.463 --> 02:48:06.206]  Now all of this goes into the centrifuge, like this blender, and... Hey, hey, hey!
[02:48:06.226 --> 02:48:07.066]  Alright.
[02:48:07.507 --> 02:48:09.948]  It's vaccine for the whole... You know what, there's more of it.
[02:48:09.988 --> 02:48:11.788]  I'll air it tomorrow in the first hour, folks.
[02:48:12.169 --> 02:48:15.010]  Gotta come back with Paul Watson and finish up with a few other news items.
[02:48:15.630 --> 02:48:18.731]  Paul, I mean, that's really how they make the vaccine, my friend.
[02:48:19.652 --> 02:48:24.794]  Yep, and then we get emails saying that it's the conspiracy theory that the government puts mercury in vaccines.
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:26.200]  Well, that's right.
[02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:27.341]  We're evil demons.
[02:48:28.021 --> 02:48:29.462]  We made that up, Paul.
[02:48:29.762 --> 02:48:32.123]  How do I have a CBS news piece saying it's nutritious?
[02:48:32.683 --> 02:48:33.203]  Exactly.
[02:48:34.324 --> 02:48:35.664]  I mean, mercury is nutritious.
[02:48:37.185 --> 02:48:40.947]  According to the Bush administration official, torturing children is good.
[02:48:41.007 --> 02:48:42.788]  I mean, what more do you need?
[02:48:47.344 --> 02:48:50.186]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.446 --> 02:48:52.027]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.367 --> 02:48:57.050]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.391 --> 02:49:04.115]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.455 --> 02:49:06.435]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:09.476]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.576 --> 02:49:14.237]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.437 --> 02:49:18.838]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.078 --> 02:49:26.300]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.981]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:59.497 --> 02:50:05.964]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:50:06.184 --> 02:50:07.465]  to below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.745 --> 02:50:11.668]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.908 --> 02:50:18.434]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:18.654 --> 02:50:24.138]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:24.378 --> 02:50:31.303]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:50:31.524 --> 02:50:35.547]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:38.209 --> 02:50:39.390]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:47.202 --> 02:50:47.663]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.546 --> 02:51:02.946]  I think so.
[02:51:22.773 --> 02:51:22.993]  I think so.
[02:51:47.514 --> 02:51:52.659]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:55.663]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.683 --> 02:51:59.186]  We've got a local news clip from Minnesota that one of our
[02:52:00.362 --> 02:52:06.890]  Engineers there saw and taped for us, and this is where they admit Minnesota and all these other governments sell all your data to these private groups.
[02:52:07.291 --> 02:52:08.312]  They allow it to be public.
[02:52:08.332 --> 02:52:09.334]  The government gets your data.
[02:52:09.354 --> 02:52:10.054]  Do you understand?
[02:52:10.515 --> 02:52:15.682]  And then they give it to everyone, and then the criminals go buy it, and then identity theft goes to all-time highs.
[02:52:15.722 --> 02:52:19.046]  It's like Bank of America selling three million names to criminals.
[02:52:19.606 --> 02:52:19.766]  It is.
[02:52:19.827 --> 02:52:20.627]  It's brazen and open.
[02:52:20.667 --> 02:52:23.229]  It always gets that way, you know, in the final days of tyranny.
[02:52:39.268 --> 02:52:54.291]  Um, the good news is this, uh, Associated Press poll, uh, young adults have healthy attitude towards privacy, where the vast majority said that the, uh, NSI spying was a step behind what the KGB did.
[02:52:55.891 --> 02:53:02.538]  And at the same time here, privacy comes from the word for the toilet.
[02:53:02.858 --> 02:53:08.323]  So even in our own privies, we have cameras now in hundreds of school bathrooms.
[02:53:08.663 --> 02:53:10.265]  Make sure you add that to the police statement.
[02:53:10.425 --> 02:53:12.426]  I mean, how far is it going to go?
[02:53:12.906 --> 02:53:19.150]  President's top officials saying torture children and crush their private parts in front of their parents?
[02:53:20.310 --> 02:53:21.551]  Jeffrey Dahmer type stuff?
[02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:23.972]  And Mercury's good for you?
[02:53:24.012 --> 02:53:25.073]  I mean, where does it end, Paul?
[02:53:26.297 --> 02:53:28.820]  Well, yeah, I mean, I wrote an article in December.
[02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:38.870]  This former White House spokesman, Blackwell, said, in the case of an imminent attack, would you torture the terrorists to gain information?
[02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:43.575]  And he argued that you would, which, of course, has never happened in history.
[02:53:43.595 --> 02:53:49.541]  And everyone agrees, who can still put two brain cells together, that
[02:53:50.177 --> 02:53:52.980]  You know, someone under that situation is not going to give credible information.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:58.647]  Well, it's a hypothetical worst case scenario just to convince and perfect the argument for torture, period.
[02:53:59.648 --> 02:53:59.768]  Yeah.
[02:53:59.789 --> 02:54:00.670]  It's a total fraud.
[02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:06.757]  So I said, you know, why not up the ante and put Bunsen burners to children?
[02:54:07.575 --> 02:54:09.456]  In order to protect the American people.
[02:54:09.997 --> 02:54:21.285]  And then this, um, spokesman for Bush yesterday comes out and says something even worse than that, or at least advocates it by saying that, you know, it'd be down to the President.
[02:54:21.325 --> 02:54:24.968]  Well, he wrote in memos, I mean, he wrote in memos the President could do that to the President.
[02:54:25.228 --> 02:54:28.350]  Oh, President, you can burn them, you can, I mean, you can crush them.
[02:54:28.911 --> 02:54:30.712]  I mean, imagine how sick that is.
[02:54:30.732 --> 02:54:32.833]  And of course, it's not even real terrorists, folks.
[02:54:33.114 --> 02:54:36.196]  The President is the man or the actual terrorist that attacked us.
[02:54:37.091 --> 02:54:45.894]  Yeah, and as Paul Craig Roberts said, you get self-implicating innocent people who will say anything to prevent this.
[02:54:46.034 --> 02:54:47.835]  So you create terrorists in that sense.
[02:54:47.855 --> 02:54:59.518]  Well, we've got the independent here, total side issue, but I mentioned it earlier, admitting that mammals they've done tests on are six times higher in mortality rate of newborn when mother was fed a diet of genetically engineered soy.
[02:54:59.538 --> 02:55:04.200]  I mean, that's what all the evidence shows, but people are still going to go out and eat this, Paul.
[02:55:05.456 --> 02:55:07.197]  They are, because they don't care.
[02:55:07.658 --> 02:55:11.741]  And to reach those people, in most cases, is not even worth the effort.
[02:55:12.021 --> 02:55:17.285]  So the point is, exactly, exactly, the point is, in this climate of this stuff, we're all being abused, folks.
[02:55:18.846 --> 02:55:25.251]  Yeah, and you can't always avoid all the trappings of it, but you can at least be aware of it, and make an effort to.
[02:55:26.192 --> 02:55:26.792]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:55:26.812 --> 02:55:29.114]  We've got to get you back up for longer than an hour sometime.
[02:55:29.434 --> 02:55:32.837]  There's been so much, and tomorrow we'll play that Minnesota clip.
[02:55:32.857 --> 02:55:34.078]  But Paul, anything else you want to add?
[02:55:35.930 --> 02:55:37.191]  No, just to keep fighting.
[02:55:37.231 --> 02:55:41.434]  I mean, a benchmark of our success is what they haven't done, not necessarily what we have.
[02:55:41.454 --> 02:55:44.916]  You know, Galloway said they'd be in Damascus and Tehran by now.
[02:55:44.936 --> 02:55:48.699]  So, where there's a will, there's a way, and we can change things for the better.
[02:55:49.539 --> 02:55:54.943]  Well, that's the point, is that they're juggernauts rolling forward, but we're slowing it.
[02:55:55.804 --> 02:55:57.365]  Yeah, and that's the best we can do.
[02:55:58.505 --> 02:55:58.945]  Exactly.
[02:55:58.965 --> 02:56:01.367]  And the longer we hold them, the worse their case gets.
[02:56:01.407 --> 02:56:04.349]  The more they're revealed, the stronger our forces grow.
[02:56:04.749 --> 02:56:06.370]  The more we can hold them back, folks.
[02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:10.193]  So, everybody, put your weight physically against their machinery.
[02:56:10.773 --> 02:56:12.134]  Stop being apologetic.
[02:56:12.174 --> 02:56:12.894]  Be bold.
[02:56:13.375 --> 02:56:15.056]  Criminals run our society.
[02:56:15.076 --> 02:56:16.157]  They must be brought to justice.
[02:56:16.417 --> 02:56:18.378]  Paul Watson, I salute you for your great work, my friend.
[02:56:18.838 --> 02:56:19.139]  Okay.
[02:56:19.159 --> 02:56:19.619]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:19.919 --> 02:56:20.239]  You bet.
[02:56:20.279 --> 02:56:21.160]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:22.161]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:22.221 --> 02:56:23.141]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.361 --> 02:56:24.422]  Get out there and take on the new world.
