[00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:06.293]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.014]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:09.834]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:11.315]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:12.976]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:17.378]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.022]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.582]  It is Tuesday, the 21st day.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.661]  Of March 2006.
[00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:34.702]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.123]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:45.167]  I'm going to spend a little bit of time this hour talking about the Charlie Sheen interview.
[00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:54.732]  Actor Charlie Sheen exposing the 9-11 cover-up, calling for a real investigation and what the mainstream media has done with this interview.
[00:00:55.032 --> 00:00:58.854]  But I'm not going to spend more than about 10 minutes on it in this first hour coming up.
[00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:04.126]  At the bottom of the hour, I think, is the best time, so be sure and stay with us.
[00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:10.210]  There have been some very, very interesting developments concerning media control.
[00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:17.714]  Now, in the meantime, we're going to get into the news.
[00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:19.575]  President Bush had a press conference this morning.
[00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:26.219]  Bush defends decisions on Iraq war and says that it will be there at least through 08, into the next administration.
[00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:29.353]  And he says, look past the bloodshed and see freedom.
[00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:33.615]  So I want to go over some of these nauseating points that he's made.
[00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:44.461]  And he also yesterday warned Israel, excuse me, in Freudian slip, warned Iran that if they don't do everything that Israel and others want, they're going to get attacked.
[00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:48.343]  And that if Israel does attack them, they better lie down and take it.
[00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:53.185]  If they fire back, that is just the ultimate evil and America will have to attack them.
[00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:54.326]  Sounds good to me.
[00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:55.386]  Hey, we're going to attack you.
[00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:56.427]  You're going to lay there and take it.
[00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:57.691]  You understand?
[00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.012]  Good.
[00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:00.793]  Also, Iraqi diplomat gave U.S.
[00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:02.674]  pre-war WMD details.
[00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:03.975]  This is from NBC News.
[00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:08.717]  Stacks on top of all the other eyewitness reports and documents that are confirmed.
[00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:10.599]  And this was even one of their agents.
[00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.399]  They paid him off.
[00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.621]  He was here, and he told them in secret meetings, look, there isn't a nuclear program.
[00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:17.202]  There isn't a biological program.
[00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:18.543]  There's just the stuff you mailed us.
[00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:28.930]  A few years ago, and then right back to the 80s, our government was mailing them botulism and anthrax and West Nile in 1994.
[00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.551]  And going back, of course, into the mid-1980s, 1983, early 1980s.
[00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:38.693]  So we'll get into this report, and just here it is, admitted, now declassified.
[00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:40.894]  They've released this information.
[00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:43.535]  It's just, okay, yeah, we knew there was nothing.
[00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:45.356]  Again, just another example of this.
[00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.636]  It's not like they screwed up.
[00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:48.077]  They knew they were lying.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.668]  Kissinger is saying, America's global strategy benefits from the Indian participation in building a new world order.
[00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:57.829]  That is a quote.
[00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:58.870]  We'll get more into that article.
[00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.193]  Jury finds Abu Ghraib, dog handler, guilty.
[00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:03.715]  This is Associated Press.
[00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:08.840]  How can he be guilty for letting the dogs chew on people when he was ordered to do that?
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.821]  I mean, I'm not defending him.
[00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:10.622]  He needs to go to prison.
[00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:19.937]  But when it's the official policy and Bush's White House is ordering the torture and those memos are public and those orders are public, why send the people to prison?
[00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.731]  I mean, this is a joke, so we'll get into that report.
[00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:26.913]  Also, Blair wants a battle of ideas with the terrorists, so he can have a battle with himself, I guess.
[00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:30.316]  Japan's rich by organs from executed Chinese prisoners.
[00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:31.937]  This is out of London Independent.
[00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:33.678]  It also happens here in the United States.
[00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:36.080]  And another one, Chinese internet dissonance.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.241]  It's a 10-year sentence.
[00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:38.241]  These are our good little buddies.
[00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:43.225]  And one I didn't get into yesterday, China bans weird baby names.
[00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:46.287]  That's the incredible freedom of our good economic
[00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:51.132]  But Iran's the threat, not China.
[00:03:51.152 --> 00:03:52.754]  China's just wonderful.
[00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:53.715]  They're good people.
[00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.538]  Back to Iraq, death squads on the prowl.
[00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.403]  Iraq convulsed by fear, and of course now it's been confirmed by Iraqi police.
[00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.962]  And even our own generals are saying, well, we don't really want to disagree with them.
[00:04:04.342 --> 00:04:08.223]  They went in that house and killed all those women and children at point-blank range while they were in handcuffs.
[00:04:09.023 --> 00:04:10.843]  First, the government denied they killed anybody.
[00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:12.144]  That is the coalition government.
[00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.084]  Now they're admitting it.
[00:04:13.844 --> 00:04:17.625]  Putting people in handcuffs and blowing their heads off is really no big deal.
[00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:24.407]  Especially six-month-old babies need to put that one in the handcuffs, but the three-year-olds and the two five-year-olds.
[00:04:25.087 --> 00:04:26.368]  Hey, they're deadly.
[00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:29.589]  You know, maybe they were crying or something.
[00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:37.571]  I mean, if the police come to your house in America and the dog's barking when they swat team you, if it's a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, they shoot it, so why not?
[00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:38.252]  The kid's crying.
[00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:41.573]  While you're blowing their parents' heads off, just grease the kid.
[00:04:42.013 --> 00:04:42.333]  Freedom!
[00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:43.373]  Good guys do.
[00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:46.975]  Sounds like something Jack Bauer would do on 24.
[00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.495]  Keeping us safe from terrorists.
[00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:52.176]  Death squads on the prowl, Iraq convulsed by fear.
[00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:53.397]  I want to get into that when we get back, but
[00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:57.275]  Paramedic who worked on WTC Morgue dies of respiratory illness.
[00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:58.617]  One of the hundreds.
[00:04:59.037 --> 00:05:00.559]  Pat's illness dad has some new comments.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.624]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:10.249]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:14.754]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:14.854 --> 00:05:16.136]  A New World Order.
[00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:18.258]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:41.956]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:47.637]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:09.615]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:21.065]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.967]  Yep, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.308 --> 00:06:30.773]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:32.815]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:39.020]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.945]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:06:49.928 --> 00:06:50.628]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.394 --> 00:07:06.298]  Did you know you could be punishing your diesel engine if you don't use a diesel fuel conditioner in the winter?
[00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:12.742]  Winter conditions don't just call for an anti-gel, but a host of additives, as diesels have trouble in the winter, especially when idling.
[00:07:13.343 --> 00:07:20.327]  SFR Diesel, with its multifunctional additive package, prevents soot buildup, maximizes performance, and improves mileage.
[00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:26.252]  If you want to run longer, run stronger, use SFR Diesel Diesel Fuel Conditioner.
[00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:30.755]  Call 888-USE-SFR-NUMBER-1 for a store near you.
[00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:34.290]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.670]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:40.552]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:47.674]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:07:48.454 --> 00:07:50.655]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:51.475]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:52.955]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:07.551]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:14.854]  Alright, I'm going to run through the international, national news, and then news from around the country, right now.
[00:08:14.874 --> 00:08:25.798]  And then coming up in about 20 minutes, at the bottom of the hour, 22 minutes to be precise, I'll get into the big Charlie Shee interview that we had here yesterday.
[00:08:26.904 --> 00:08:35.076]  Dr. Charlie Sheen questions official 9-1-1 story, calls for truly independent investigation, joins growing ranks of prominent, credible whistleblowers.
[00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:37.960]  He'll give you an idea of where this is going, come up in about 20 minutes.
[00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:51.455]  For the first time ever, linked to, well I guess they had actually linked to stories before they were posted on other sites of our work, but he's never directly linked to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:57.016]  He linked and it was up for about three and a half, four hours, and then pulled, and it's not pulled the way Drudge pulls stories.
[00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:02.618]  Drudge will let them roll down to the bottom and then put them in his previous headlines.
[00:09:03.524 --> 00:09:04.644]  It was expunged.
[00:09:04.704 --> 00:09:06.705]  It was completely removed.
[00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:08.006]  They never do that.
[00:09:08.026 --> 00:09:09.706]  I've been watching drugs for a decade.
[00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:11.287]  Know how they operate.
[00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:13.328]  And it just went into the memory hole.
[00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.309]  And the articles didn't roll down when they did that.
[00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:19.490]  They just added one about 30 million bags lost in the airports.
[00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.751]  That one replaced it.
[00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:23.612]  And then I made some calls.
[00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:25.572]  Well, first I got contacted by some press this morning.
[00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:26.833]  And then I made some calls.
[00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:37.835]  Uh, and I talked to some of the chieftains in some different media bureaus, and one of them I talked to, boy, he was a real piece of work.
[00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:40.798]  And if Charlie Sheen has a crooked toenail,
[00:09:41.764 --> 00:09:42.725]  Or anyone of his ilk.
[00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:43.785]  It's top news story.
[00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:52.911]  Or if Santana puts out a milquetoast statement about how he has a different philosophy from Bush on war, it's a big AP article out of the very same AP office.
[00:09:53.611 --> 00:10:01.256]  But when it's Charlie Sheen saying that Bush is arrogant and going in all these hotels about 9-11 and calling for a real investigation, I mean, that is incredibly newsworthy.
[00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:03.557]  Well, see, I'm already covering this.
[00:10:03.617 --> 00:10:07.880]  I'll tell you what happened when we talked to Hollywood Reporter.
[00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:10.965]  I'll tell you what happened when we talked to the Associated Press.
[00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:15.988]  And again, they still may run something on this, one of the other offices, and it frankly doesn't even matter.
[00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:20.751]  The alternative media is now bigger than mainstream media in most cases.
[00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:35.679]  They've got big mainline outlets that can really saturate, but if you stack up the alternative media next to the mainstream media, and this is their own admission, the alternative media about a year ago got as big and is now much bigger and is growing exponentially.
[00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:39.775]  We have a few places that are crossover, like Coast to Coast AM.
[00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:48.545]  It's one of the only big line old media formats of talk radio that has kept its audience of 16 million or so a night.
[00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:54.011]  Whereas, look at O'Reilly's top viewership, 3 million for his so-called big TV show.
[00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:57.194]  So they're really legends in their own minds.
[00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:08.807]  What, 8 million people in the last 12 hours or so have gone to the site and just presentplanet.com and Infowars and read our story.
[00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:13.252]  See how much bigger that is than Mr. O'Reilly?
[00:11:13.613 --> 00:11:16.276]  Again, it's not about, quote, just being big.
[00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:17.577]  It's actually scary for me.
[00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:18.719]  It's daunting.
[00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:24.222]  But it's about how they can act as gatekeepers and shut this down.
[00:11:24.242 --> 00:11:26.544]  So I'm asking you to go get the article.
[00:11:26.964 --> 00:11:30.866]  Actor Charlie Sheen questions official 9-1-1 story at the top of InfoWars.com.
[00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:33.768]  That's the second story in the General News on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:42.051]  And to get it and to email it out to everyone, to email it out to your local TV, radio, Associated Press, UPI, Reuters.
[00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:43.512]  I want them to be swimming in it.
[00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:48.375]  I want them to be knee-deep in this article and ask them, hey, why aren't you picking this up?
[00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:54.159]  You picked up Santana, who isn't one-tenth as big as a Charlie Sheen.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.961]  Plus, the tabloids love this guy.
[00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.583]  He's the darling of the tabloids.
[00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:01.745]  Been in over 65 major films.
[00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:04.288]  Okay, I'll tell you the rest of the story later.
[00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:08.794]  It's just incredible to see the control at work.
[00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:12.819]  And see, I wasn't sure it was control, so I made phone calls and I discovered it was.
[00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:16.123]  I mean, I've got names of these people.
[00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.465]  I discovered it was.
[00:12:18.394 --> 00:12:22.999]  I was calmly talking to them and one of them was screaming at me.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.240]  They're so upset.
[00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.382]  They're so afraid.
[00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:28.645]  I wonder who the head AP guy is in Los Angeles.
[00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.387]  I wonder how you get that kind of job.
[00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:33.310]  Boy, that'd be a nice place for a gatekeeper, wouldn't it?
[00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.752]  We've seen a lot of that in the news.
[00:12:35.473 --> 00:12:35.933]  I wonder.
[00:12:35.973 --> 00:12:39.317]  It's just all very, very interesting.
[00:12:40.831 --> 00:12:41.892]  So we'll get into that.
[00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:44.575]  Alright, let's dive into the news right now.
[00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:48.359]  Bush defends decision on Iraq war, Associated Press.
[00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:52.863]  President Bush said Tuesday, the decision about when to withdraw all U.S.
[00:12:52.923 --> 00:12:58.689]  troops from Iraq will fall to future presidents and Iraqi leaders, suggesting that U.S.
[00:12:58.749 --> 00:13:02.012]  involvement will continue at least through 2008.
[00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:04.275]  Acknowledging the public's growing unease,
[00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:05.556]  Uh, yeah.
[00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:11.180]  With the war and election year skittishness among fellow Republicans, the President nonetheless vowed to keep U.S.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.040]  soldiers in the fight.
[00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.862]  Let me get my Texas accent, my fake one.
[00:13:15.683 --> 00:13:18.785]  If I didn't believe we could succeed, I wouldn't be there.
[00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:20.506]  I wouldn't put those kids there.
[00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:21.347]  Bush, declared.
[00:13:22.207 --> 00:13:26.250]  He also stood by embattled Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld.
[00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.671]  I don't believe he should resign.
[00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:29.032]  He's doing a fine job.
[00:13:29.432 --> 00:13:32.815]  Every war plan looks good on paper until you meet the enemy, he said.
[00:13:34.137 --> 00:13:39.080]  But your real war plan said you wanted to break it up into three or four regions, preferably three.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.961]  That goes back to the 80s and restated in the 90s and then in 2002 and 2003.
[00:13:43.582 --> 00:13:48.664]  And have endless civil war because the defense contractors, A, make more money the longer they're there.
[00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:53.627]  And then B, you want to control that oil longer and build permanent bases.
[00:13:53.847 --> 00:14:02.371]  And C, you want to use Iraq as a military launch base to project power into Iran and Syria and you'll have a total link up then with Afghanistan to the east.
[00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:05.749]  Right to the door of China.
[00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:12.872]  Oh, but, you know, oh, we just, you know, it looks good on paper until you meet the enemy.
[00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:14.453]  Aren't you the one that said, let's roll?
[00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:21.436]  In his second full-blown news conference of the year, Bush confronted his political problems by addressing them directly.
[00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:22.596]  Nobody likes war.
[00:14:22.616 --> 00:14:25.037]  It creates a sense of uncertainty in the country, he added.
[00:14:25.357 --> 00:14:26.438]  War creates trauma.
[00:14:27.938 --> 00:14:30.401]  You know all about trauma-based mind control, don't you, Bush?
[00:14:30.781 --> 00:14:31.842]  You told your biographer in 99.
[00:14:32.303 --> 00:14:33.744]  I mean, you had this book published.
[00:14:33.784 --> 00:14:35.486]  This is what you told your biographer.
[00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:42.190]  You said you're going to be a war president because you can't be questioned with your domestic policies when you've got the people in a war.
[00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:43.511]  Now, you said that.
[00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:45.273]  Bush Peanak said that in September 2000.
[00:14:45.313 --> 00:14:47.875]  You guys say it over and over again.
[00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:52.139]  We're supposed to ignore your actual policy papers that go out to your minions.
[00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:54.081]  See, there's different levels of media.
[00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:58.885]  There's the general public that gets all their news just watching TV, sitcoms and dramas that are laced with propaganda.
[00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:02.367]  Then you've got another segment of the populace, 20-30%, around there.
[00:15:02.387 --> 00:15:11.350]  I mean, I don't have a significant number on that, but the media reports that it's only 25-30% depending on what study it is that really is into the news.
[00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:17.072]  And then that's fake left-right paradigms and different flavors of propaganda, different layers of the onion.
[00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:24.334]  But you guys have got to communicate with your tens of thousands of minions and viceroys and employees and agents and people that carry this out.
[00:15:25.143 --> 00:15:28.985]  Your policy developers and people that execute them.
[00:15:29.225 --> 00:15:31.086]  And so it's all in policy papers.
[00:15:31.146 --> 00:15:33.707]  It's all public that you get all this on purpose.
[00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:43.931]  And it's called PNAC and it's called your biographer and it's called all your statements and it's called Brzezinski's book and it's CFR meetings on C-SPAN.
[00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:45.291]  Next time you see one on your
[00:15:47.683 --> 00:15:53.985]  Online schedule there, or on your digital cable or satellite or whatever, just flip through and see when they're going to have a CFR meeting.
[00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:55.366]  They have one on C-SPAN about every month.
[00:15:55.786 --> 00:16:11.231]  And then half the time you tune in, they'll just openly be talking about the New World Order, and how they're going to use things like 9-11 for a New World Order, and how Iraq's going really well, and this is the whole plan.
[00:16:14.243 --> 00:16:21.686]  You'll see the Naval War College darling Barnett, Thomas Barnett, Dr. Barnett up there admitting all this.
[00:16:21.726 --> 00:16:23.346]  I mean, it won't be Alex Jones saying it.
[00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:25.227]  It'll be them saying what I'm saying.
[00:16:25.787 --> 00:16:27.588]  People go, Alex, how does he know all this?
[00:16:27.628 --> 00:16:28.448]  How does he calculate?
[00:16:28.468 --> 00:16:29.669]  How does he predict everything?
[00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:30.829]  How does he know it?
[00:16:31.109 --> 00:16:32.590]  I just read what they say.
[00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.410]  I watch them.
[00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.531]  I mean, it's not hard.
[00:16:36.286 --> 00:16:38.227]  That's what's so frustrating about all of this.
[00:16:38.607 --> 00:16:39.908]  But obviously I shouldn't be frustrated.
[00:16:39.928 --> 00:16:43.430]  72% of the troops say they're against the war and want out.
[00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.871]  Same type of numbers here in the U.S.
[00:16:47.452 --> 00:16:49.834]  And so, what are we going to do?
[00:16:49.854 --> 00:16:50.954]  It's just they don't care.
[00:16:51.675 --> 00:16:53.796]  None of us want these big toll roads with transponders.
[00:16:53.816 --> 00:16:54.196]  They do it.
[00:16:54.936 --> 00:16:56.077]  We don't want the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:16:56.097 --> 00:16:57.318]  We don't want a national ID card.
[00:16:57.338 --> 00:16:57.718]  They do it.
[00:16:58.254 --> 00:16:59.576]  We don't want open borders.
[00:16:59.616 --> 00:17:00.457]  They just keep doing it.
[00:17:00.938 --> 00:17:04.162]  Or they'll have some little thing where we're going to send a hundred cops in the next year.
[00:17:04.182 --> 00:17:07.707]  Every month there'll be a contingent of ten cops down there.
[00:17:07.727 --> 00:17:14.496]  And there'll be, well, actually five of them are cops, two will be state guard, one will be national guard, and one will be a local sheriff.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.821]  We're going to spend ten million dollars next year.
[00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:24.663]  It's like if your dam breaks and you're going to throw a grain of sand into it to stop it and they'll have some big press conference down there.
[00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:29.665]  I'm just, it's just, they're dismantling this country right in front of us.
[00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:32.306]  Right in front of us.
[00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:37.988]  Bush looked past Iraq bloodshed and he sees freedom, this is Associated Press,
[00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:48.842]  And it's got his little sick little quotes here that we see freedom, death squads, the newspapers all run by the Pentagon admittedly, killing children, our troops breathing DU.
[00:17:50.183 --> 00:17:53.585]  All of this happening, total carnage, by design.
[00:17:55.126 --> 00:17:57.588]  Thirteen years of sanctions and now three years of this.
[00:17:57.628 --> 00:17:59.309]  That's sixteen years!
[00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.153]  It's been almost sixteen years since the sanctions started.
[00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:06.495]  In just a few months,
[00:18:09.452 --> 00:18:10.312]  16 years of it!
[00:18:10.372 --> 00:18:11.973]  And it'll be going on in 16!
[00:18:12.153 --> 00:18:12.893]  Don't worry!
[00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:15.373]  In fact, that's what Bush is saying.
[00:18:15.413 --> 00:18:17.014]  It's going to go well past 08.
[00:18:17.774 --> 00:18:19.574]  And there's not a troop drawdown.
[00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:21.975]  They're going from 140,000 to anywhere from 170,000 to 180,000.
[00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:24.935]  There's a troop build-up.
[00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:29.176]  But don't worry, Bush warns Iraq on Israel.
[00:18:30.076 --> 00:18:31.496]  The threat from Iran, of course.
[00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:34.857]  Their stated objective is to destroy our strong ally Israel.
[00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:36.673]  That's a threat, a serious threat.
[00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:37.834]  It's a threat to the world peace.
[00:18:37.854 --> 00:18:38.314]  The U.S.
[00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:42.618]  said after speaking in a speech defending the war in Iraq.
[00:18:42.698 --> 00:18:42.958]  The U.S.
[00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:58.671]  President said, I made it clear and I'll make it clear again that we will use military might to protect our ally Israel, said Bush, who was apparently referring to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmad Jadjad, I can't ever pronounce his name, called for destruction of Israel.
[00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:09.576]  On the atomic dispute, Bush said he hopes to solve this issue diplomatically by a united message to Tehran from Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, as well as Russia, hopefully, and China.
[00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:15.459]  What happens is, every time Israel says they're going to destroy 200 sites and attack Israel, he responds and says, we'll destroy you.
[00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:19.680]  Bush says, you're going to feel great pain and suffering.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.642]  Bolton says it, head UN envoy from the US.
[00:19:23.402 --> 00:19:25.923]  And then they repeat back exactly what he says,
[00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:38.284]  You know, the president of Iran, who I'm not even defending, the guy's a nut too, he says, he says, OK, we don't want to have a war with you, but if you attack us, we'll cause you great pain and suffering.
[00:19:38.304 --> 00:19:38.725]  Headline!
[00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:40.726]  He said he'll create great pain and suffering.
[00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:41.407]  Can you believe him?
[00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:43.569]  Just quoting back what Bush and Bolton said.
[00:19:46.101 --> 00:19:47.343]  So we'll come back and get into Iraq.
[00:19:47.363 --> 00:19:48.184]  Diplomat gave U.S.
[00:19:48.204 --> 00:19:50.747]  pre-war WMD details and told them there's no WMDs.
[00:19:51.007 --> 00:19:52.569]  That was their own paid agent telling them that.
[00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:52.970]  They knew.
[00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.815]  Also, Kissinger is America's global strategy for a new world order.
[00:19:57.215 --> 00:19:58.196]  Wait till you hear about that.
[00:19:58.216 --> 00:19:58.617]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.024 --> 00:20:04.065]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.385 --> 00:20:07.167]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:11.590]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.891]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:17.774]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:20.356]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.856 --> 00:20:21.717]  Sheltering in place.
[00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:35.543]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:20:52.173 --> 00:20:53.153]  Currency devaluation.
[00:20:53.213 --> 00:20:53.453]  Inflation.
[00:20:53.473 --> 00:20:53.954]  One and the same.
[00:21:10.842 --> 00:21:20.684]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.104 --> 00:21:24.225]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.485 --> 00:21:26.326]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:29.406]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.947 --> 00:21:32.167]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.547 --> 00:21:36.088]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.608 --> 00:21:40.229]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.819 --> 00:21:44.561]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:10.363]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:14.385]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[00:22:15.091 --> 00:22:16.552]  Would the Marines accept this?
[00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:27.499]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:29.400]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.322]  Forced confiscation of guns?

[00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:42.492]  Call now.
[00:22:42.832 --> 00:22:47.978]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:02.618]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:06.021]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:11.626]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:23:11.927 --> 00:23:21.475]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:23:21.756 --> 00:23:23.938]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[00:23:24.218 --> 00:23:27.781]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:31.264]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:23:31.544 --> 00:23:35.087]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.710]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.112]  I'm really amazed.
[00:23:40.272 --> 00:23:46.117]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:23:46.257 --> 00:23:48.659]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:55.743]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:23:55.763 --> 00:23:57.144]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:23:57.324 --> 00:23:58.405]  You know what's really hilarious?
[00:24:20.109 --> 00:24:26.375]  Our Charlie Sheen interview has been, of course, posted all over the internet, blogs, forums, everywhere.
[00:24:26.395 --> 00:24:44.271]  And all these neocons, the tiny little gun-grabbing anti-American minority they are, the ultra-Soviet minority they are, are sending little threatening, little mean emails about, ah, Charlie Sheen, look, you know, he had trouble with women and drugs in the past, back in the 90s.
[00:24:45.282 --> 00:24:47.724]  So how dare him have any right to say anything?
[00:24:48.084 --> 00:25:01.033]  Your president is a DWI-admitted cokehead who kisses on and hugs on male prostitutes inside the press briefing room in front of everyone and you all ignore it.
[00:25:01.053 --> 00:25:06.897]  He knows he can just do it in front of everybody and they admittedly bus in gay porn stars.
[00:25:07.057 --> 00:25:11.320]  So at least Charlie Sheen back in the 90s, it was women.
[00:25:13.544 --> 00:25:14.925]  And he doesn't do that anymore.
[00:25:14.965 --> 00:25:15.825]  He's a homebody now.
[00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:17.006]  And listen, I talked to the guy.
[00:25:17.026 --> 00:25:17.546]  I was impressed.
[00:25:17.566 --> 00:25:18.146]  He knows all about 9-11.
[00:25:18.206 --> 00:25:19.547]  He's been listening to the show for years.
[00:25:20.387 --> 00:25:23.729]  And we had him on because it exposes 9-11.
[00:25:24.209 --> 00:25:26.790]  And I can't wait to write a response to these nutjobs.
[00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.071]  I mean, you guys are really pathetic.
[00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:29.571]  I know.
[00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:33.233]  Jeff Gannon and all those other people.
[00:25:33.293 --> 00:25:34.233]  I'm not just talking about Jeff Gannon.
[00:25:34.253 --> 00:25:39.896]  You understand the New York Post and others have reported, the San Francisco Chronicle, that literal jets land
[00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:50.072]  With $5,000 a day male prostitutes from all over America and Europe to go in there with your Christian conservative leaders and enjoy themselves?
[00:25:50.572 --> 00:25:53.815]  I mean, it makes Brokeback Mountain look like a TiddlyWinks.
[00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:57.237]  I can't wait to write a response to this stuff.
[00:25:57.878 --> 00:26:01.300]  I mean, you guys are just unbelievable.
[00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:03.402]  Oh, and you're so Christian.
[00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:05.603]  Now look at who Christ was out there working with.
[00:26:05.623 --> 00:26:06.864]  Look at who he was reforming.
[00:26:06.904 --> 00:26:07.585]  Look at who he was.
[00:26:08.165 --> 00:26:10.127]  You guys need to get the sticks out of your own eyes.
[00:26:11.193 --> 00:26:13.636]  Now, maybe you'd like Shane if it was men.
[00:26:14.477 --> 00:26:16.159]  I understand you're good Republicans.
[00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:18.101]  I understand basically who runs the Republican Party.
[00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:19.202]  Drudge and all that crew.
[00:26:20.123 --> 00:26:22.145]  I mean, believe me, I fully understand.
[00:26:22.906 --> 00:26:24.929]  And so, you're mad that Charlie likes girls.
[00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:26.931]  And it upsets you.
[00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:28.633]  It's very upsetting to you.
[00:26:29.411 --> 00:26:30.591]  Of course, this is my audience.
[00:26:30.632 --> 00:26:32.512]  It isn't even the neocons that are emailing me.
[00:26:32.532 --> 00:26:33.693]  I've just got to write all this up.
[00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:37.494]  You guys cannot deal with reality.
[00:26:37.995 --> 00:26:39.095]  You can't deal with anything.
[00:26:39.255 --> 00:26:43.697]  Go drink your Jack Daniels, and you know, you're good, and everything's fine.
[00:26:45.418 --> 00:26:46.818]  Charlie, she doesn't even drink now.
[00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:48.159]  He has a teetotaler.
[00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:50.164]  And that's been reported on by the press.
[00:26:50.624 --> 00:26:53.505]  But George Bush is known to be falling down drunk half the time.
[00:26:53.685 --> 00:26:55.706]  Oh no, he doesn't drink anymore.
[00:26:55.766 --> 00:26:56.526]  It's just confirmed.
[00:26:56.546 --> 00:27:03.588]  New York Daily News, he grabs 17-year-old staffers, screaming with a purple face, spitting all over them, and then starts throwing furniture around.
[00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:06.369]  But that's okay, he's on Prozac!
[00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:16.313]  It's okay, George Bush is a good Christian man at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove with all the gay prostitutes.
[00:27:21.576 --> 00:27:24.481]  So, keep the emails coming.
[00:27:24.521 --> 00:27:29.249]  Of course, it's the vast minority of them, but these neocons, they get on these
[00:27:31.658 --> 00:27:33.739]  They get on these forums and they just can't stand it.
[00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:35.479]  They want to turn their guns in.
[00:27:35.939 --> 00:27:37.560]  They want this country bankrupt.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.222]  They love China and these foreign countries taking over our ports and roads.
[00:27:42.282 --> 00:27:43.102]  They love it.
[00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:43.862]  They do.
[00:27:43.922 --> 00:27:44.462]  I've talked to them.
[00:27:44.502 --> 00:27:45.463]  They love it.
[00:27:45.643 --> 00:27:47.523]  I've had neocons say, I want to take a chip.
[00:27:47.803 --> 00:27:48.904]  I want one to prove I'm good.
[00:27:48.924 --> 00:27:50.904]  They want to put all the Arabs in camps.
[00:27:51.125 --> 00:27:52.265]  All the Muslims in camps.
[00:27:52.305 --> 00:27:55.246]  They want to live in a police state because they're cowards.
[00:27:55.866 --> 00:28:03.953]  Because deep down they know the New World Order is coming down, so they've made a psychological decision to rationalize everything.
[00:28:04.414 --> 00:28:05.695]  To ignore everything.
[00:28:05.735 --> 00:28:07.396]  To say DU is good for you.
[00:28:08.697 --> 00:28:12.601]  I mean, there's a bunch of people I know who are young, who've got lung cancer.
[00:28:13.662 --> 00:28:17.345]  Lung cancer is up six-fold from two years ago.
[00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:20.728]  And we're living in an insane asylum.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.141]  But you're not worried about that?
[00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:27.123]  Oh no, you're all over the web attacking me and others saying, no, no, DU's good.
[00:28:27.384 --> 00:28:28.184]  DU's not bad.
[00:28:28.224 --> 00:28:28.945]  It's a good weapon.
[00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:30.025]  I don't apologize for that.
[00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:31.206]  Well, good then!
[00:28:31.286 --> 00:28:32.107]  Enjoy it!
[00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:35.829]  I know you'll email me or call me in a year when you're dying of lung cancer.
[00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.731]  Going, man, I should have listened to you, Alex.
[00:28:38.811 --> 00:28:39.672]  I'm so sorry.
[00:28:39.692 --> 00:28:41.373]  Of course, probably then you won't even do it.
[00:28:41.713 --> 00:28:43.775]  Well, that was probably secondhand smoke.
[00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:49.438]  I love George W. I hope they bomb 200 and something sites in Iran using DU.
[00:28:51.392 --> 00:28:54.053]  I hope they do, because it's a good weapon.
[00:28:54.393 --> 00:28:56.074]  Turn it into a parking lot.
[00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.115]  But you say you support the troops.
[00:28:58.155 --> 00:28:59.856]  Why do you want them breathing it?
[00:28:59.876 --> 00:29:01.717]  It ain't bad for them, Alex.
[00:29:01.857 --> 00:29:02.797]  Shut up!
[00:29:04.398 --> 00:29:05.919]  But the military's own handbooks.
[00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:06.759]  Their own manuals.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.600]  The document's going back to the 70's on this.
[00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:10.601]  It's deadly.
[00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:11.301]  It's horrible.
[00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:12.782]  It's radioactive.
[00:29:12.802 --> 00:29:13.562]  It's poisonous.
[00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:19.405]  They've used the equivalent amount used in 44,000 A-bombs at the Hiroshima and Nagasaki sites.
[00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:21.767]  What's Harold Schemer?
[00:29:22.228 --> 00:29:23.408]  I'll kill them too!
[00:29:23.448 --> 00:29:24.368]  But no, I'm talking about us.
[00:29:24.388 --> 00:29:24.908]  We're breathing it.
[00:29:25.108 --> 00:29:25.688]  Shut up!
[00:29:25.949 --> 00:29:27.249]  But the detectors are picking up.
[00:29:27.689 --> 00:29:28.509]  High levels of it.
[00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.570]  Huh?
[00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.450]  Detectors?
[00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:30.710]  What?
[00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.251]  You need a detector upside your head, boy.
[00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:34.651]  Listen, please, listen to me.
[00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:36.391]  The globalists are psychopathic.
[00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:37.532]  No, they're not.
[00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:38.092]  You are.
[00:29:38.152 --> 00:29:39.452]  You need to be in a camp.
[00:29:40.252 --> 00:29:41.473]  I think you ought to be in a camp.
[00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.533]  I got emails like that today.
[00:29:43.353 --> 00:29:45.254]  People like, you need to be locked up.
[00:29:45.714 --> 00:29:47.034]  I like George W. Bush.
[00:29:47.094 --> 00:29:49.455]  We'll cover a lot of news when we get back.
[00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:54.662]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.563 --> 00:29:58.364]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.685 --> 00:30:04.986]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:09.608]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:30:10.128 --> 00:30:17.511]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance crew and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:30:17.932 --> 00:30:21.913]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:30:22.313 --> 00:30:35.758]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:30:36.158 --> 00:30:39.559]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of stem enhancers.
[00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:44.185]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:30:44.565 --> 00:30:47.468]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:30:47.628 --> 00:30:50.931]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:30:50.992 --> 00:30:52.473]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:04.425]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.746 --> 00:31:09.669]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.293]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:23.480]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.323]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.603 --> 00:31:32.631]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.931 --> 00:31:39.661]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:40.702]  What about you?
[00:31:41.431 --> 00:31:46.794]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:47.935]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.015 --> 00:31:49.916]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.829 --> 00:32:04.151]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:04.411 --> 00:32:06.453]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:06.593 --> 00:32:13.640]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:22.488]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:33:02.737 --> 00:33:07.879]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.861]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:15.812]  Michael, Keith, James, Chris, Chris, and many others.
[00:33:15.832 --> 00:33:17.272]  Take your calls.
[00:33:17.292 --> 00:33:19.832]  Don't forget to join us.
[00:33:19.852 --> 00:33:20.092]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:20.993 --> 00:33:22.193]  I want to get into all this news.
[00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:25.894]  I've already covered some of it, but let me just get the Charlie Sheen stuff out of my system.
[00:33:27.534 --> 00:33:31.655]  Because I've got a nice little stack.
[00:33:31.675 --> 00:33:31.995]  I don't know.
[00:33:32.015 --> 00:33:37.476]  It's probably about 12 or so really mean emails.
[00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:39.017]  Of course, we've gotten hundreds of nice ones.
[00:33:42.162 --> 00:33:48.146]  We just simply pointed out that Charlie Sheen has gone public about 9-11 and how the official story is a fraud.
[00:33:49.147 --> 00:34:02.215]  That's newsworthy and he's done his research and the neocons try to make it an issue of, well, he was, you know, he was in a lot of trouble, I guess really most of about 10 years ago.
[00:34:03.716 --> 00:34:06.378]  Drugs, women, Hollywood stuff, you know, young guy.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.260]  That doesn't matter.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.422]  It's Larry Silverstein says he blew up building 7.
[00:34:12.774 --> 00:34:18.957]  And the point is, there are a lot of other Hollywood people, and you'd know the names right now if I said them, some of the biggest names.
[00:34:19.938 --> 00:34:20.798]  Bigger than Charlie Sheen.
[00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:25.081]  Who I've talked to privately, who know the truth about 9-11.
[00:34:25.121 --> 00:34:26.261]  I mean, a bunch of them.
[00:34:27.082 --> 00:34:29.163]  I don't even contact these people, they contact me.
[00:34:30.324 --> 00:34:30.644]  Okay?
[00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:34.566]  And they're blown away, but they're afraid to go public.
[00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:36.507]  They're just giving everybody copies of the films, and...
[00:34:37.972 --> 00:34:38.473]  We're good to go.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.204]  Some of the things that happened to him when he did that, that's a good thing.
[00:35:03.364 --> 00:35:06.887]  And even if you don't agree with somebody, it's good that they're speaking up and involved.
[00:35:07.268 --> 00:35:19.638]  And whether you like it or not, Hollywood people do get more attention paid to them than physics professor Stephen Jones or underwriter laboratories testing the steel and saying what happened with jet fuel is impossible.
[00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:35.238]  uh... kevin ryan or the german defense minister andres von buehler michael major number three in the blair cabinet resigning and saying you know the war on terror is bogus and looks like the government's involved or ray mcgovern you know high-level c.i.a.
[00:35:35.298 --> 00:35:48.827]  briefer uh... chief briefer for ronald reagan and george bush senior chief analyst for him from the central intelligence agency saying the same thing here i mean this is real and we have them on and we we cover those issues that when we put the sheen
[00:35:49.477 --> 00:36:04.627]  Press release out, with the article up at the top, we had a big block of all these credible people that are saying... And let me tell you something, Charlie was a little bit nervous yesterday on air, but I think he did a great job in the interview, but you gotta talk to the guy when he's not on air and not nervous about what he's saying.
[00:36:04.827 --> 00:36:11.471]  Very well spoken, very well informed on so many things I'm not even going to get into, because I'm going to let him say what he wants to say and that's it.
[00:36:12.672 --> 00:36:18.336]  And the other people he knows that are awake in Hollywood, a whole other circle of people that are as big as it gets,
[00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:19.859]  That have seen the films.
[00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:21.940]  You know, they go over to his house and they all sit around and watch him.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.240]  For, he said, ten hours straight or whatever.
[00:36:25.901 --> 00:36:33.262]  You know, the point is, is that we're getting Hollywood to wake up and not be tools of this elite, of this establishment.
[00:36:34.703 --> 00:36:36.663]  And that's exciting and that's why we did the interview.
[00:36:37.283 --> 00:36:38.884]  You know, we were the first to interview Jones.
[00:36:38.904 --> 00:36:40.464]  We were the first to interview Von Bulow.
[00:36:40.484 --> 00:36:41.804]  We were the first to interview Meacher.
[00:36:42.525 --> 00:36:44.045]  We were the first to interview Ray McGovern.
[00:36:44.085 --> 00:36:45.265]  What, three and a half years ago?
[00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:46.946]  We're the first to interview all these people.
[00:36:47.786 --> 00:36:48.466]  Morgan Reynolds.
[00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:51.231]  We get the scoop time and time again.
[00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:53.072]  We bring you the people first.
[00:36:53.853 --> 00:36:56.675]  And again, I'm sitting here having a debate with a non-existent audience.
[00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:59.137]  I know 95% of you out there listening are on board.
[00:37:00.558 --> 00:37:01.759]  And you understand what's going on.
[00:37:01.779 --> 00:37:02.800]  You've researched what I'm saying.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.561]  You know it's facts.
[00:37:04.241 --> 00:37:08.385]  I'm responding, and I guess I'll write an article about this, to the sniveling neocons.
[00:37:08.405 --> 00:37:12.428]  Who will deny that Cheney shot Whittington any closer?
[00:37:13.607 --> 00:37:16.029]  And they'll still deny that Cheney was drinking even when he admits it.
[00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.512]  And of course the shooting thing isn't even that important.
[00:37:18.592 --> 00:37:19.813]  It just shows the lawlessness.
[00:37:20.233 --> 00:37:23.636]  They're still denying it and attacking me and I still get emails attacking me about that.
[00:37:24.897 --> 00:37:27.039]  I got a call on a local radio show I was on this morning.
[00:37:30.282 --> 00:37:34.826]  I was on with Dale and Bob on SECA and of course Charlie Hodge.
[00:37:37.731 --> 00:37:43.874]  When the guy called in and just said my whole test, ballistic test, was a big lie, and it's just, I'm just lying, and I don't like George Bush, and I'm an evil liberal.
[00:37:44.414 --> 00:37:46.875]  No, you're the liberal by your stupid yardstick.
[00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:50.116]  And I'm so tired of you people.
[00:37:50.156 --> 00:37:55.399]  I mean, Ron Paul has said that Bush is no conservative, and it's worse than Bill Clinton, in what he's actually doing.
[00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.880]  Bob Barr has said Bush is more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.340]  He's on the NRA board.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.661]  You think Bob Barr is some evil liberal?
[00:38:01.721 --> 00:38:02.042]  No!
[00:38:02.642 --> 00:38:05.303]  He's a conservative's conservative, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:08.212]  We are the majority.
[00:38:08.493 --> 00:38:09.834]  We love this country.
[00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:11.675]  We don't like going into a police state.
[00:38:11.955 --> 00:38:16.178]  We don't like the Patriot Act being used in non-terror-related cases as federal judges have ruled.
[00:38:16.798 --> 00:38:18.079]  They've been doing it now for four years.
[00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:23.123]  I'm tired of the lies, and I'm tired of America lying to itself.
[00:38:24.724 --> 00:38:26.225]  Now granted, you're a minority now.
[00:38:26.745 --> 00:38:29.988]  The neocon followers are a minority, but you're a large minority.
[00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:32.830]  I'd say about 30% of this country.
[00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:33.630]  Polls show 33%.
[00:38:35.525 --> 00:38:36.466]  And you're delusional!
[00:38:36.886 --> 00:38:38.147]  You are delusional!
[00:38:38.547 --> 00:38:45.291]  I owe an allegiance to the Bill of Rights Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, and my family, and this country, and to do what's right for my family.
[00:38:45.951 --> 00:38:57.278]  And you owe your allegiance to someone who is a fourth-generation elitist, who is in the hip pocket of the British royal family, and in bed with the Bin Laden family in business.
[00:38:57.318 --> 00:38:57.958]  That's admitted.
[00:38:58.019 --> 00:38:58.839]  Don't roll your eyes.
[00:38:58.879 --> 00:38:59.780]  Don't say it's not true.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.400]  Go check it out.
[00:39:01.974 --> 00:39:06.498]  And you're so caught up in your rah-rah, liberal versus conservative, you don't know you've been scammed.
[00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:07.839]  I actually love you.
[00:39:07.899 --> 00:39:08.660]  I care about you.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.664]  And I'm just so sick of your smirking, giggling, laughing.
[00:39:12.804 --> 00:39:13.945]  It isn't funny.
[00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.087]  Breathing DU isn't funny.
[00:39:16.147 --> 00:39:17.528]  National ID cards aren't funny.
[00:39:17.868 --> 00:39:19.150]  Open borders aren't funny.
[00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:25.095]  And if another one of you sends me an email telling me Bush is pro-control-the-border, I'm gonna throw up.
[00:39:25.495 --> 00:39:27.297]  Don't send me another Bush is pro-gun thing.
[00:39:27.317 --> 00:39:28.378]  I mean, when I was buying that
[00:39:29.947 --> 00:39:33.348]  28-gauge shotgun, do the test, down at McBride's, a nice gun shop here in town.
[00:39:33.368 --> 00:39:34.548]  I had two of the employees there.
[00:39:35.088 --> 00:39:37.569]  Well, Alex, you should stop lying about George Bush.
[00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:39.769]  That's exactly how they talk.
[00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:44.650]  I don't know if people affect an overly, you know, Texas accent.
[00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.530]  It really gets annoying.
[00:39:47.271 --> 00:39:49.751]  Alex, Bush isn't an anti-gun.
[00:39:49.771 --> 00:39:50.932]  He wasn't for the assault weapons ban.
[00:39:50.952 --> 00:39:53.892]  One of the other employees, the manager's like, no, no, he really did.
[00:39:53.952 --> 00:39:54.812]  No, no, Alex is right.
[00:39:54.832 --> 00:39:57.033]  Of course, most of them were fans in there, most of them.
[00:39:57.614 --> 00:40:04.055]  You know, I think I probably talked to probably about ten people in there and like eight of them shook my hand and two of them were looking at me angrily and I heard them mumbling.
[00:40:04.075 --> 00:40:04.535]  I'm like, what?
[00:40:04.555 --> 00:40:06.536]  They're like, you shouldn't talk about George Bush.
[00:40:06.556 --> 00:40:08.316]  I mean, what's wrong with you?
[00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:09.936]  I don't understand you!
[00:40:09.956 --> 00:40:15.577]  I mean, what I'm telling you is as true as the sun coming up this morning or setting this evening.
[00:40:16.897 --> 00:40:20.718]  And I meant to get off into the sheen thing and then get your calls, but it's just, it's bigger than that.
[00:40:21.438 --> 00:40:26.819]  It's, it's that, it's that George Bush can be an admitted narcotics user,
[00:40:27.808 --> 00:40:51.121]  Have DWIs be falling down drunk routinely, running around basically attacking staffers, we reported on that two years before it was in the New York Daily News, grabbing them and screaming at them and turning purple, throwing fits, passing out, stumbling around, drinking heavily, that's all been confirmed, and all of his womanizing.
[00:40:51.562 --> 00:40:53.623]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, we really don't have
[00:40:54.884 --> 00:41:00.829]  Evidence of Bush imbibing in the men as much of his cabinet and others do.
[00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:05.227]  Though we know that he did put his cheek up against Gannon and started rubbing him on the back of the neck.
[00:41:05.247 --> 00:41:06.307]  I mean, that was caught on video.
[00:41:06.347 --> 00:41:07.648]  The AP photos picked it up.
[00:41:07.928 --> 00:41:08.649]  And it just was put out.
[00:41:08.689 --> 00:41:09.529]  Like, what is this?
[00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:11.710]  And then other times, he's always touching on him.
[00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.632]  And the guy was in there dozens and dozens of times.
[00:41:14.712 --> 00:41:15.752]  Fifty-something times.
[00:41:15.992 --> 00:41:16.953]  Was it 53 times?
[00:41:16.993 --> 00:41:17.573]  Memory serves.
[00:41:18.173 --> 00:41:22.476]  It passed midnight, creeping around the White House and bringing in other male escorts.
[00:41:22.516 --> 00:41:23.376]  That's mainstream news.
[00:41:24.076 --> 00:41:28.679]  Male escorts that this male madam, who's also in porno movies,
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:42.870]  Jeff Gannon aka Guckard is in there and the New York Post and others report confirmed top gay porn stars quote service moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[00:41:44.831 --> 00:41:46.392]  I mean you can't make stuff up like that.
[00:41:46.452 --> 00:41:55.479]  I've got Spy Magazine and stories that people reporters got from the 80s where it described buses from the airport full of the male prostitutes.
[00:41:56.559 --> 00:42:01.943]  But that's okay, or that's not true, or old Bush gets up when he was young, and this is going on there.
[00:42:01.963 --> 00:42:02.904]  I mean, I got Richard Nixon.
[00:42:02.924 --> 00:42:03.865]  We can't play the clip on the air.
[00:42:03.885 --> 00:42:04.725]  There's profanity in it.
[00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:11.511]  But just type in a Richard Nixon, Bohemian Grove quote into Google, or go to our Bohemian Grove archive on prisonplanet.com.
[00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:12.231]  It's halfway down.
[00:42:12.271 --> 00:42:14.533]  Go listen to him talking to Harper's Magazine about it.
[00:42:14.853 --> 00:42:17.154]  Well, Bohemian Grove, you know, in San Francisco, I'm a member of.
[00:42:17.194 --> 00:42:19.855]  Well, they're at the club in Northern California.
[00:42:20.355 --> 00:42:22.056]  It's just absolutely disgusting.
[00:42:22.076 --> 00:42:25.237]  The most bleeping, faggy thing you've ever seen.
[00:42:25.257 --> 00:42:27.838]  The things they do there, all of them, it's just sick.
[00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:28.999]  But I'm a member.
[00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:29.499]  I go.
[00:42:29.519 --> 00:42:37.462]  I mean, that's the President of the United States in a huge homosexual devil cult.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.580]  Wallowing around.
[00:42:39.941 --> 00:42:41.181]  That's what they do in the coffins.
[00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:42.581]  They're at Skull and Bones.
[00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:43.622]  And that's okay.
[00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:45.022]  Bush is okay.
[00:42:45.082 --> 00:42:47.123]  But Charlie Sheen's bad.
[00:42:47.723 --> 00:42:48.583]  He doesn't do it anymore.
[00:42:48.664 --> 00:42:49.704]  He's said it's bad.
[00:42:49.744 --> 00:42:52.125]  He's apologized for it.
[00:42:52.645 --> 00:42:57.687]  You know, for masses of women and drugs.
[00:43:00.607 --> 00:43:01.868]  Prodigal son.
[00:43:02.685 --> 00:43:03.305]  Does it matter?
[00:43:03.345 --> 00:43:09.969]  The point is, he's well-spoken, he's intelligent, he's prominent, he's putting himself on the line, knowing he, more than anybody else, is going to get attacked.
[00:43:10.009 --> 00:43:11.710]  He has amazing bravery.
[00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.731]  Believe me, folks, I'm not starstruck.
[00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:16.453]  I know people a lot bigger than Charlie Sheen.
[00:43:17.033 --> 00:43:19.434]  Okay, I'm into doing the news, covering information.
[00:43:19.835 --> 00:43:24.958]  I am struck, though, by his courage to come on this broadcast and do what he did.
[00:43:26.038 --> 00:43:27.099]  And he needs to be commended.
[00:43:27.799 --> 00:43:29.320]  And I know most of you are commending him.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.821]  It's just to see these sniveling
[00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:36.450]  Sniveling neocon followers who just deny everything.
[00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:52.993]  And of course, if they can't buy the fact that Bush, through regulations, not even laws, is attacking importation of guns, and double the size of the BATF, and they built some giant building for him, some huge, one of the biggest federal buildings now in D.C., that Bush is paid to have built, that's now almost completed.
[00:43:53.233 --> 00:43:54.253]  I mean, that's scary!
[00:43:55.753 --> 00:43:56.513]  That's scary!
[00:43:56.593 --> 00:44:01.114]  And if they can't even admit that to themselves, they're not going to admit homosexual prostitutes.
[00:44:02.111 --> 00:44:06.514]  In the White House, past midnight, 50-something times with other male prostitutes with them.
[00:44:07.515 --> 00:44:10.096]  These aren't male prostitutes for the women, boys and girls.
[00:44:11.097 --> 00:44:20.023]  This is for the neocons, those disgusting fat old men in there, or little twerply men doing all the things they do.
[00:44:20.043 --> 00:44:22.785]  It just makes me sick.
[00:44:24.186 --> 00:44:25.987]  It makes me want to throw up.
[00:44:27.501 --> 00:44:32.562]  And you know, I'm not saying the things Charlie Sheen's done is good, but my gosh, being 25 years old and liking racy women.
[00:44:34.323 --> 00:44:37.604]  If that's the case, then King David, a man after God's own heart, is in deep trouble.
[00:44:38.764 --> 00:44:41.285]  He had people killed for their women and God forgave him.
[00:44:41.565 --> 00:44:45.506]  But you can't forgive Charlie Sheen, can you?
[00:44:48.547 --> 00:44:51.167]  Last time I checked, he isn't killing people for their women.
[00:44:52.808 --> 00:44:53.688]  He just likes them.
[00:44:55.635 --> 00:45:03.982]  And what hypocrites are you out there to tell yourselves just because you've never acted on impulses, and that's good, that you don't like women?
[00:45:07.444 --> 00:45:07.765]  All right.
[00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.846]  Again, I'm responding to these emails.
[00:45:09.866 --> 00:45:11.307]  I should just write an article later about it.
[00:45:12.248 --> 00:45:17.733]  But the bigger news, the bombshell, and we'll see if I'm... I hope I'm proven wrong.
[00:45:18.573 --> 00:45:21.916]  The bombshell is that
[00:45:23.297 --> 00:45:25.019]  I got a call from Charlie last week.
[00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:26.400]  Check, it is Charlie Shing.
[00:45:28.442 --> 00:45:30.885]  Talked to him three or four times, sometimes an hour and a half at a time.
[00:45:32.326 --> 00:45:33.528]  He wants to come on.
[00:45:34.228 --> 00:45:35.129]  He wants to stand up.
[00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:40.555]  The only place he felt safe, he said, to come out and speak, where he wouldn't be taken out of context.
[00:45:40.635 --> 00:45:41.516]  And I said, Charlie,
[00:45:44.648 --> 00:45:53.950]  You know, you're so on target with this that they'll probably, there's a good chance they'll ignore it because it'll be so mainline and the facts you lay out will be so documented that they can't attack you.
[00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.610]  This isn't something dirty to say about you.
[00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:01.391]  I predicted that there'd be a predominant blackout in the mainstream media on this.
[00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:05.592]  And other people are like, oh, no way, man.
[00:46:05.632 --> 00:46:10.293]  I mean, you know, if a Hollywood person falls off their bicycle, it's top news.
[00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:11.173]  Especially Charlie Sheen.
[00:46:11.213 --> 00:46:11.833]  I said, just watch.
[00:46:13.906 --> 00:46:16.188]  And then we get a call from AP.
[00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:19.871]  We're talking to them.
[00:46:20.691 --> 00:46:21.512]  They're going to do a story.
[00:46:22.193 --> 00:46:22.993]  But nothing happens.
[00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:25.135]  We call AP out in LA.
[00:46:25.175 --> 00:46:26.276]  Talk to their head guy out there.
[00:46:27.497 --> 00:46:31.099]  Jeff Williams, I believe is the name, left the notes at the home office.
[00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:31.940]  I should have brought those with me.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.261]  Yeah, it's Jeff Williams.
[00:46:34.182 --> 00:46:36.344]  And he's just real, yeah, Alex, what do you want?
[00:46:36.884 --> 00:46:40.227]  Just real tough guy.
[00:46:40.247 --> 00:46:41.648]  He's got that whole M.O.
[00:46:41.688 --> 00:46:41.988]  about him.
[00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.791]  I wonder if he's seen some terrorism in Southeast Asia.
[00:46:44.811 --> 00:46:45.651]  I wonder what he's been up to.
[00:46:45.671 --> 00:46:50.933]  But an important position there at AP in Los Angeles over the Propaganda Bureau.
[00:46:51.453 --> 00:46:52.394]  Seemed like an experienced fellow.
[00:46:52.414 --> 00:46:57.175]  And I'm like, yeah, you guys aren't going to run this story?
[00:46:58.716 --> 00:46:59.936]  And he goes, no we're not!
[00:46:59.956 --> 00:47:01.657]  I know all about Charlie Sheen.
[00:47:01.697 --> 00:47:03.538]  I personally don't care what he says.
[00:47:03.598 --> 00:47:04.038]  And I go, oh!
[00:47:04.927 --> 00:47:06.868]  But is it newsworthy, Mr. Williams?
[00:47:07.448 --> 00:47:11.629]  Your very office, your very AP office put out the Santana story.
[00:47:11.709 --> 00:47:23.534]  Carlos Santana just with a milquetoast statement, I said, I said a tame statement about, you know, he disagrees with the war and he's into peace and love, a different philosophy than Bush.
[00:47:24.154 --> 00:47:25.114]  He said, ah, whatever.
[00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:27.155]  And I said, well, I need to quote you on this.
[00:47:27.655 --> 00:47:28.976]  Are you saying this isn't newsworthy?
[00:47:30.816 --> 00:47:32.377]  And he said, we're not going to run anything.
[00:47:33.047 --> 00:47:36.949]  And I said, is it newsworthy to have Charlie Sheen saying Bush is arrogant?
[00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.792]  Wouldn't you normally run that if it wasn't attached to all this 9-11 information?
[00:47:41.292 --> 00:47:43.413]  And he said, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BAIT ME!
[00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:44.934]  And slammed the phone down.
[00:47:46.415 --> 00:47:48.576]  He just, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BAIT ME!
[00:47:48.836 --> 00:47:49.557]  CLANG!
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:51.578]  And then I called back and the woman answered.
[00:47:51.598 --> 00:47:54.180]  She's like, they must have audits or phone numbers.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.500]  She's like, yes.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.961]  And I go, what's your name?
[00:47:56.981 --> 00:47:57.522]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:57.542 --> 00:47:58.502]  She goes, I'm not gonna talk to you.
[00:47:58.602 --> 00:48:00.924]  I'll send you back to Mr. Williams.
[00:48:03.027 --> 00:48:06.708]  And I'm like, uh, don't you think this is newsworthy?
[00:48:07.528 --> 00:48:11.569]  Don't you think Charlie Sheen is newsworthy?
[00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:16.971]  I mean, regardless of what you think of him personally, isn't this newsworthy?
[00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:18.051]  And she hung up.
[00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:25.193]  And I said, alright, baby, to my wife who's sitting by me at her terminal, I said, I'm gonna call the Hollywood Reporter.
[00:48:25.533 --> 00:48:32.175]  And then I turn around and do something else, and she's ringing, and she starts talking to him, and talks to a real nice fellow, and we're not gonna say his name, and he's like, yeah, I think it's newsworthy, yeah.
[00:48:32.771 --> 00:48:39.894]  Yep, I was on the desk here yesterday afternoon, came in, I passed it on, I should think we should do a story on it.
[00:48:40.974 --> 00:48:42.975]  I would think this is newsworthy, but we've been told we're not doing one.
[00:48:44.136 --> 00:48:45.996]  And she's like, that's unusual.
[00:48:46.016 --> 00:48:46.897]  He goes, mm-hmm, yes.
[00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:47.837]  Thank you.
[00:48:47.857 --> 00:48:48.818]  Gotta go.
[00:48:50.278 --> 00:48:59.042]  So that was obviously somebody who wasn't some type of establishment operative, some type of little unofficial or whatever gatekeeper who thinks they can control what the news is.
[00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:07.994]  And so then we call up another major wire and get the same thing.
[00:49:08.075 --> 00:49:09.395]  Oh yeah, we've heard about it.
[00:49:09.956 --> 00:49:11.217]  Oh no, we're not touching it.
[00:49:12.838 --> 00:49:15.880]  I mean, is it a journalistic cowardice or could it be?
[00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:31.657]  All the big news articles about billions, 1.6 billion spent on fake news, the Frank Church hearings of the seventies where a lot of AP chiefs, most reporters aren't agents, but a lot of big AP chiefs over major regions are CIA.
[00:49:32.557 --> 00:49:42.841]  I wasn't even looking for that when I was researching Herman Roosevelt's after action reports after he carried out bombings in Iran to blame it on Mosaddegh, Mohammad Mosaddegh.
[00:49:43.696 --> 00:49:45.197]  And it gets on the CIA's own website.
[00:49:45.217 --> 00:49:46.638]  You can link through and read the official documents.
[00:49:46.978 --> 00:49:47.439]  CIA.gov.
[00:49:47.479 --> 00:49:48.399]  You might want to check it out.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.541]  And read one of the, there's like three after-action reports.
[00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:54.523]  It's the after-action report, I believe, to Tim Downing Street.
[00:49:54.964 --> 00:49:58.246]  And then it's duplicated to Washington.
[00:49:59.366 --> 00:50:02.388]  I believe it was Eisenhower.
[00:50:03.149 --> 00:50:09.273]  And he says, well, we already control most of the news wires, AP, Washington Post, New York Times, with our officers as editors.
[00:50:09.513 --> 00:50:12.155]  But we need to get control of more of them because stuff's slipping out.
[00:50:12.802 --> 00:50:19.949]  Just go read him saying it in a report to the President and a report to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
[00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.512]  So I'm not paranoid in thinking what I heard, man.
[00:50:26.334 --> 00:50:34.161]  Or just maybe, you know, a lot of times they just go pick people that already have these views and think that they can just sit around gatekeeping whenever they want.
[00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:35.923]  And again, I don't need Associated Press.
[00:50:35.943 --> 00:50:38.085]  I've been in Associated Press probably 30-something times.
[00:50:39.278 --> 00:50:43.002]  I'm quite proud of getting it in the Associated Press that Janet Reno is the butcher of Waco.
[00:50:43.042 --> 00:50:43.442]  Remember that?
[00:50:44.023 --> 00:50:47.747]  And that got covered on Fox News, but I guess that was Janet Reno, so it was okay.
[00:50:48.688 --> 00:50:49.689]  No, I know how this works.
[00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:50.850]  I mean, we've got our own media.
[00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:51.651]  We don't need you.
[00:50:52.031 --> 00:50:56.155]  But the story is, the story is, this story's been shut down.
[00:50:56.836 --> 00:51:00.500]  Drudge did something he's never done before, in my experience.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.501]  When we get back on...
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.442]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.702 --> 00:51:07.283]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.623 --> 00:51:12.286]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.647 --> 00:51:19.351]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.691 --> 00:51:21.671]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.892 --> 00:51:24.732]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:29.493]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.693 --> 00:51:34.074]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.334 --> 00:51:41.556]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.796 --> 00:51:44.217]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:05.353]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[00:52:14.842 --> 00:52:19.527]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.987 --> 00:52:26.714]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

[00:53:02.932 --> 00:53:08.855]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.095 --> 00:53:11.356]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:51.004 --> 00:53:56.875]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:13.497]  But to experience the gatekeeping, to experience the block, I mean to talk to reporters and they're just like,
[00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:42.185]  Other reporters who weren't Mr. Smarty Pants like Mr. Williams, Jeff Williams, like, oh yeah, we know about it, oh yeah, it's, it's, yeah, I thought it was worthy, yeah, I'll pass it on.
[00:54:43.386 --> 00:54:54.975]  One other time I talked to a Reuters reporter about Schwarzenegger, and he said, this is totally newsworthy, this is huge, I've been working here a long time, I've only seen this on war stories, the London office, this had been signed off on by the U.S.
[00:54:55.035 --> 00:54:57.557]  office, the London office, the head office says no.
[00:55:00.273 --> 00:55:04.474]  I'm not going to say which Reuters outfit, well I already did it, it doesn't even matter.
[00:55:04.975 --> 00:55:14.358]  The point is, is that, well it was the reporters, that's what matters, is that this is the control, this is the gatekeeping, and somebody screwed up.
[00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:16.498]  Drudge has got a couple different webmasters over there.
[00:55:16.518 --> 00:55:27.962]  Drudgey was probably out on the town enjoying himself, or lord knows what, and so they posted it, and we were already getting hundreds of thousands of
[00:55:28.703 --> 00:55:30.264]  We're good to go.
[00:55:48.067 --> 00:56:01.033]  This was visitors, millions, just streaming in and we're there backing the servers up and getting more bandwidth and I'm on the phone having to ride the buck and bronco because what happens is Drudge links and then a thousand other sites link.
[00:56:01.894 --> 00:56:02.574]  And then boom!
[00:56:04.175 --> 00:56:05.615]  Drudge takes it off.
[00:56:05.635 --> 00:56:09.437]  And Drudge, I've been watching this format for 10 years, it hasn't changed.
[00:56:10.398 --> 00:56:17.641]  Drudge lets headlines roll down and he moves them down and then they go in his recent headlines.
[00:56:18.932 --> 00:56:19.653]  It disappeared.
[00:56:19.693 --> 00:56:22.956]  He didn't change the format of any other areas of the page, which he never does.
[00:56:24.958 --> 00:56:37.869]  And just that link was changed to another story about the 30 million bags being lost by the TSA last year, in 2005, and how horrible it is.
[00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:41.692]  And he just, the story just disappeared.
[00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:42.613]  It's like, that went up,
[00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:44.978]  A phone call got made, but I wasn't sure.
[00:56:45.018 --> 00:56:48.780]  I just thought maybe Dredge just didn't like it or somebody else didn't and just took it down.
[00:56:50.401 --> 00:56:55.044]  And then I start talking to reporters who are like, yeah, it's really newsworthy.
[00:56:56.104 --> 00:56:58.105]  We would normally run it, but we're not.
[00:56:59.406 --> 00:57:08.491]  And then I call the head honcho and one of the minions out in California, and he's just like, we're not running it.
[00:57:09.191 --> 00:57:10.352]  No, we're not going to run it.
[00:57:11.025 --> 00:57:12.066]  Yeah, I know about it.
[00:57:12.186 --> 00:57:13.446]  And Alex, we're not going to run it.
[00:57:13.506 --> 00:57:14.067]  Okay, buddy?
[00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:15.307]  Alright?
[00:57:17.508 --> 00:57:21.991]  And it's just such an illustration of what we face and what we deal with.
[00:57:22.011 --> 00:57:25.412]  And that's why it's up to you to spread the word on the stories we put out.
[00:57:25.792 --> 00:57:27.893]  If you don't do it, nobody will.
[00:57:28.794 --> 00:57:30.875]  If you don't report, no one will.
[00:57:31.776 --> 00:57:59.138]  It is so vitally important that you report, that you get the word out, that you email your friends, that you email your family, that you call the Associated Press all over this country, every office, that you've got one in your town, if it's a good size city, and you call them and you say, hey, and most of these people are nice, most of them aren't on some government payroll, and say, isn't that newsworthy that Charlie Sheen, especially Charlie Sheen,
[00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:03.850]  But see, everything he said was so credible that they can't really attack it.
[00:58:04.891 --> 00:58:08.354]  Folks, I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com and get some of the Citizen Rule books.
[00:58:08.594 --> 00:58:11.117]  10 of them for $10, 100 of them for $75.
[00:58:11.157 --> 00:58:12.097]  We're selling them at cost.
[00:58:13.138 --> 00:58:14.579]  We're selling these at our cost.
[00:58:16.661 --> 00:58:21.125]  And I just want you to get the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, this terrorist document.
[00:58:21.841 --> 00:58:28.987]  I want you to have this, and also any order of a VHS or DVD or book on tape or book, all the great stuff we've got at Infowars.com.
[00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:30.968]  Any order you make, you get one of these.
[00:58:30.988 --> 00:58:33.010]  And if you order like five or more things, we throw two in.
[00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:34.731]  So be sure to go to Infowars.com.
[00:58:34.751 --> 00:58:39.035]  Alright, we'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:39.075 --> 00:58:40.436]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.677 --> 00:58:45.900]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.268 --> 00:58:57.909]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.569 --> 00:58:59.610]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.351 --> 00:59:01.492]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.112 --> 00:59:02.933]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.674 --> 00:59:04.574]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.255 --> 00:59:08.938]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.439 --> 00:59:13.502]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:27.600]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:28.361 --> 00:59:30.902]  We are now in to hour number two.
[00:59:30.922 --> 00:59:35.325]  We've got a lot of news on China, a lot of news on the economy, news on torture.
[00:59:35.345 --> 00:59:37.286]  It's all very, very important.
[00:59:37.306 --> 00:59:41.228]  But right now, you guys have been holding very, very patiently.
[00:59:41.248 --> 00:59:46.371]  So I'm going to go ahead and start taking some of your calls until the first few phone banks have completed their statements.
[00:59:46.752 --> 00:59:48.693]  And I'll get back into the news.
[00:59:50.114 --> 00:59:51.735]  Michael in New York, you're on the air.
[00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:52.335]  Thanks for holding.
[00:59:55.996 --> 00:59:57.157]  Okay, Michael's gone.
[00:59:57.657 --> 01:00:00.138]  Let's talk to Keith in Ohio.
[01:00:00.178 --> 01:00:00.898]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:00:01.278 --> 01:00:01.739]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:01.759 --> 01:00:03.279]  You just keep on plugging away there.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.401]  And there's a new service I've come across recently.
[01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:09.622]  It's called AlertNet.org.
[01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:15.385]  And for many years, it's been supplying information on humanitarian crisis around the world.
[01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:24.049]  And I think it's important for people to kind of keep up with the worldwide view of what's going on, especially like forgotten emergencies.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.482]  And that way we can educate ourselves and we can be more effective.
[01:00:27.642 --> 01:00:28.903]  Exactly!
[01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:40.070]  Life is very, very cheap and the globalists are doing a lot of horrible things all over the planet right now and we're in our own little bubble here being propagandized and the rest of the world can see a lot more than we can.
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:47.655]  You know, like Congo in the last eight years has been like four million people that have died through war and violence and diseases and so forth.
[01:00:47.695 --> 01:00:48.716]  Yeah, I was a man of that.
[01:00:49.056 --> 01:00:50.177]  Just imagine, you know, there's all these
[01:00:50.959 --> 01:01:05.684]  Natural resources, what the Luciferian globalists are involved in, and how the possibility is there, and we can make a difference through informing ourselves and effective praying, because this is a spiritual battle, primarily.
[01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:06.865]  Well, I agree with you, Ed.
[01:01:06.945 --> 01:01:07.885]  Here's another example.
[01:01:09.311 --> 01:01:17.979]  In the Sudan, the Muslims really are the only place in the world that they're really killing Christians, and our government doesn't say a word, doesn't do a thing.
[01:01:18.599 --> 01:01:23.824]  Meanwhile, they go around pointing their finger at even secular governments that are leaving us alone, and oh, they're evil, we've got to invade them.
[01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:34.453]  You know, there's a lot of interconnection behind evil, you know, like there's great connections between the Vatican and Islam, and there's connections between these, you know,
[01:01:35.294 --> 01:01:39.216]  Occultists that are globalists, I mean, they want to wipe out 80% of the world's population.
[01:01:39.236 --> 01:01:40.197]  That's in their own documents.
[01:01:40.217 --> 01:01:40.857]  Well, they're doing it.
[01:01:40.877 --> 01:01:41.957]  The Biodiversity Treaty.
[01:01:41.977 --> 01:01:42.618]  They're doing it.
[01:01:42.778 --> 01:01:46.920]  The more we can educate, you know, wisdom and knowledge, then we can have a sharp force.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.422]  Did you know malaria conservatively kills 60 million a year?
[01:01:52.683 --> 01:01:54.143]  Yeah, it's so much.
[01:01:54.263 --> 01:01:55.324]  It's like AIDS.
[01:01:55.444 --> 01:01:58.305]  AIDS was created, you know, to wipe out populations.
[01:01:58.365 --> 01:02:00.987]  The more we can be educated, the more these things can be
[01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:04.120]  Withstood, you know, and so... I agree.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.521]  No one can debate the DU.
[01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:08.322]  I mean, that's hurting us all right now, blowing all over the planet.
[01:02:08.703 --> 01:02:09.463]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:10.263 --> 01:02:12.645]  And some people won't go research AIDS being engineered.
[01:02:13.145 --> 01:02:14.145]  So, fine.
[01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:14.946]  Don't go investigate it.
[01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:15.386]  It's true.
[01:02:15.446 --> 01:02:16.086]  Declassified.
[01:02:16.126 --> 01:02:16.427]  Public.
[01:02:16.447 --> 01:02:16.827]  Available.
[01:02:17.227 --> 01:02:17.967]  What about DU?
[01:02:17.987 --> 01:02:18.928]  I mean, you can't ignore that.
[01:02:19.808 --> 01:02:21.990]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Maryland.
[01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.630]  James, go ahead.
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.811]  Hi Alex, I had a couple of headlines off of CNN.
[01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:28.071]  I thought you might be interested.
[01:02:29.072 --> 01:02:29.712]  Sure.
[01:02:29.732 --> 01:02:32.213]  800 to 1,200 new officers in New York City.
[01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:39.875]  And the second one is US forces accused of killing 15 family members in Haditha.
[01:02:40.435 --> 01:02:43.176]  Yeah, and then they first tried to deny the attack itself.
[01:02:43.256 --> 01:02:46.637]  Now they say, oh, we accidentally killed some kids, but the police report
[01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:52.159]  And the autopsy shows they were handcuffed and all shot execution style in the head.
[01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.280]  Then the building was blown up and they blew up a firebomb on the cars outside.
[01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:58.221]  And it's just atrocious.
[01:02:58.921 --> 01:03:02.942]  Yeah, those people are coming back here, but at least the borders are open.
[01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:07.464]  Well, and it's conservative to be for gun control now, too.
[01:03:08.864 --> 01:03:11.045]  Have you heard about the new officers in New York City?
[01:03:11.085 --> 01:03:12.265]  Do you know what the real numbers are?
[01:03:13.124 --> 01:03:14.285]  I heard they were going to hire more.
[01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:16.126]  I haven't seen that particular article you mentioned.
[01:03:16.747 --> 01:03:18.007]  I just saw it on CNN.
[01:03:18.047 --> 01:03:20.529]  The last thing we need is more police.
[01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:22.690]  800 to 1,200 new officers.
[01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:26.453]  The last thing we need, because they don't have them out doing detective work or really busting crooks.
[01:03:26.793 --> 01:03:28.995]  They steal your car, good luck getting them to come out to your place.
[01:03:29.295 --> 01:03:30.756]  Your house gets broken into, good luck.
[01:03:30.776 --> 01:03:31.936]  And I'm not saying cops are bad.
[01:03:32.377 --> 01:03:35.739]  Just that they got the average cop out collecting fines and we don't need more of that.
[01:03:38.138 --> 01:03:38.879]  Much less indebted.
[01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:39.820]  What about the officers?
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.921]  Number one cause of death is getting hit by cars.
[01:03:42.342 --> 01:03:44.884]  See these cops hanging their hind ends out in the middle of the highway?
[01:03:45.264 --> 01:03:45.665]  Good points.
[01:03:45.705 --> 01:03:46.765]  Thanks for the call, James.
[01:03:48.287 --> 01:03:48.807]  I mean, for what?
[01:03:48.827 --> 01:03:50.148]  To ride a stinking ticket?
[01:03:50.168 --> 01:03:51.089]  You don't need that money.
[01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:52.030]  The government's got plenty of money.
[01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:59.853]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.153 --> 01:04:01.533]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.914]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.155]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.435 --> 01:04:11.397]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:15.739]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:15.999 --> 01:04:17.780]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:28.508]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.648 --> 01:04:30.549]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.749 --> 01:04:34.592]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[01:05:54.098 --> 01:05:58.043]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:05:58.424 --> 01:06:01.948]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:05.893]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:06:06.274 --> 01:06:11.140]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:17.263]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:06:17.563 --> 01:06:21.265]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.706]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:29.809]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:06:30.229 --> 01:06:31.410]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:32.851]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:38.374]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.

[01:06:43.658 --> 01:06:43.918]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:06:57.503 --> 01:07:01.767]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:07:02.347 --> 01:07:03.168]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.909 --> 01:07:04.769]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:09.413]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.674 --> 01:07:13.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:21.063]  The sniveling, nobody, daddy's boy puppet, George W. Bush.
[01:07:21.724 --> 01:07:25.127]  The Kenny Buckport, main-carpet-baggin' fake cowboy.
[01:07:28.112 --> 01:07:32.115]  Tells us that we brought freedom to Iraq and it's a loving what we're doing.
[01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:35.197]  We're going to be there for many more years and it's a great thing.
[01:07:36.477 --> 01:07:42.221]  We'll be talking about that and then we have stories here like jury finds Abu Ghraib, dog handler, guilty.
[01:07:42.241 --> 01:07:43.482]  I've got a problem.
[01:07:44.923 --> 01:07:48.285]  I've got a problem with that and I'll tell you why here in a few minutes.
[01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:52.007]  Right now let's just keep going to your calls so people get a chance to get on air.
[01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:53.709]  Chris in Florida, go ahead.
[01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:55.690]  Hi Alex.
[01:07:57.181 --> 01:08:05.349]  I was on a drudge about a year and a half ago, and I noticed a similar instance of what happened to you, or the article linking to you.
[01:08:05.369 --> 01:08:09.132]  The article was where the Miami Herald... A lot of stations just joined us this hour.
[01:08:09.173 --> 01:08:09.593]  Recap.
[01:08:09.613 --> 01:08:10.494]  Tell folks what's going on.
[01:08:11.637 --> 01:08:17.440]  Well, it sounded like you said the Drudge had linked to you on the Charlie Sheen interview that you had yesterday.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.342]  Yes, and I've been visiting his site for ten years and I've never seen him pull articles.
[01:08:21.382 --> 01:08:23.103]  He'll pull them and stick them in the archive.
[01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:31.327]  He doesn't completely pull them, and after just four hours, he pulled it and replaced it with a similar headline, didn't change the general format.
[01:08:31.547 --> 01:08:34.348]  When he changes, usually the whole thing changes or the top changes.
[01:08:34.708 --> 01:08:38.290]  Instead, he just, he didn't pull it or move it, he just totally pulled it.
[01:08:39.312 --> 01:08:53.583]  Right, and I noticed he did that one other time at least when I emailed him and never got a response, but it was just a Miami Herald where they covered how the federal court has a secret docket down there in Miami-Dade County.
[01:08:54.187 --> 01:08:55.648]  So I just want to bring that to your attention.
[01:08:55.788 --> 01:08:57.670]  Oh yeah, that was just about a month ago.
[01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:58.651]  Totally illegal.
[01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:02.154]  A violation of the Fifth Amendment and one other.
[01:09:02.174 --> 01:09:04.716]  Popped my head a second.
[01:09:05.016 --> 01:09:07.078]  And that's huge news.
[01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:08.039]  That's huge news.
[01:09:08.099 --> 01:09:09.260]  I never saw that on Drudge.
[01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:12.042]  Yeah, I saw that about a year and a half ago.
[01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:18.908]  There was a new article about a month ago how thousands of defendants, they're doing it in New York now too, it's just secret.
[01:09:18.928 --> 01:09:20.390]  Non-terror related.
[01:09:22.478 --> 01:09:25.279]  I want to talk about unconstitutional and that stuff.
[01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:25.919]  I don't know.
[01:09:26.099 --> 01:09:27.060]  I've got to look into this more.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.360]  A friend has been telling me about it.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.881]  They also have these secret budgets.
[01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:33.462]  The County Commission has secret budgets.
[01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:34.862]  I think you mentioned that before.
[01:09:34.882 --> 01:09:37.163]  Anyway, I'll have to look into that more.
[01:09:37.183 --> 01:09:51.288]  But I just wanted to thank you for having Charlie on yesterday and thank him because, you know, I see how the media really resents the fact that they can't question or validate what you have to say, so they are obligated to attack it.
[01:09:51.747 --> 01:09:56.910]  When they know in their heart that they need to just, uh, they need to quite, uh, validate and document it.
[01:09:57.431 --> 01:10:01.253]  And the fact that you had Charlie on yesterday, you know, makes them ambivalent.
[01:10:01.413 --> 01:10:05.696]  I mean, they'd love to cover it, but they would hate what their editors would have to say if they did.
[01:10:06.137 --> 01:10:06.597]  Exactly.
[01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:07.637]  I appreciate the call.
[01:10:08.858 --> 01:10:14.302]  That's what I'm saying, that I've talked to a lot of big Hollywood people, as big or bigger than Charlie Sheen.
[01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:17.504]  None of them were as informed on 9-11 as Charlie Sheen.
[01:10:17.564 --> 01:10:20.486]  None of them is well-spoken, especially when we talk on the phone many times.
[01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:25.434]  And been listening to the show for years, been getting the films, been giving them to people, showing them to other people.
[01:10:26.035 --> 01:10:32.700]  And then the courage of knowing, you know, his past with the media, and to come out and do that, it just shows a boldness.
[01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:46.592]  And then the neocons savage him because, you know, a decade ago or so, some high-dollar call girls, escorts, drugs, things like that,
[01:10:47.449 --> 01:10:50.270]  And then we've got George Bush and Jeff Gannon.
[01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:51.411]  And it's not just Jeff Gannon.
[01:10:51.511 --> 01:10:53.011]  It's been in the back of the paper.
[01:10:53.091 --> 01:11:03.296]  It's admitted that it was masses, 53 times, past midnight, with Gannon with other call men, call boys.
[01:11:05.597 --> 01:11:07.718]  And then, of course, we have the Washington Times article from 1988.
[01:11:09.828 --> 01:11:11.369]  ...admitting that George Bush Sr.
[01:11:11.409 --> 01:11:12.010]  was connected.
[01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.474]  Seriously, we have the news article with underage callboys in the White House late at night.
[01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:30.823]  And then we have, at the same time, Barney Frank has 14-year-olds at his house, a whoredom up there, of disadvantaged youth he'd gotten a hold of.
[01:11:30.883 --> 01:11:35.326]  And because he's a globalist, man, the cops, they're above the law.
[01:11:36.905 --> 01:11:38.707]  I mean, Barney Frank was caught.
[01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:42.290]  Do you understand running a whorehouse with underage boys?
[01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:54.519]  He had a literal stable up in his, what do they call it, a stable up in his big three-story house in D.C.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.861]  Nothing happened.
[01:11:57.902 --> 01:11:58.342]  But you know what?
[01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:00.163]  Conservatives don't want to talk about that.
[01:12:00.323 --> 01:12:01.464]  Again, Barney Frank's a liberal.
[01:12:01.504 --> 01:12:02.265]  I mean, I attacked him.
[01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:03.526]  I attack all these people.
[01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:08.101]  Admittedly, at Bohemian Grove, they bring in all these male prostitutes.
[01:12:08.341 --> 01:12:10.143]  That's mainstream admitted.
[01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:12.385]  That that's the main taste.
[01:12:12.445 --> 01:12:13.646]  It's 4 to 1 men.
[01:12:14.006 --> 01:12:16.208]  They bring in high dollar women as well.
[01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:18.570]  When the jets land, they offload them.
[01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:19.771]  They fly in from Europe.
[01:12:20.772 --> 01:12:21.132]  Okay?
[01:12:21.673 --> 01:12:23.775]  Back in the 80's, it was $2,000 an hour.
[01:12:24.435 --> 01:12:25.296]  That's what the press was reporting.
[01:12:25.316 --> 01:12:26.177]  Imagine what it is now.
[01:12:28.806 --> 01:12:30.566]  So we have that going on.
[01:12:30.606 --> 01:12:31.286]  Here's Charlie Sheen.
[01:12:31.567 --> 01:12:33.967]  Hasn't been involved in any of that in what, about ten years.
[01:12:34.507 --> 01:12:35.227]  Totally clean.
[01:12:35.367 --> 01:12:36.227]  Doesn't even drink now.
[01:12:38.148 --> 01:12:40.268]  And he's being attacked.
[01:12:40.448 --> 01:12:44.769]  Oh, well, Charlie Sheen, you know, he's been in trouble in the past, so he can't have his opinion.
[01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:56.271]  Well, again, and these are so-called Christians saying this, and I'll repeat, King David sent one of his men out to be killed so he could have his wife because he left it after and he repented and God forgave him.
[01:12:56.811 --> 01:12:57.231]  Saul,
[01:12:58.061 --> 01:13:03.983]  of Tarsus hunted down Christians and chopped their heads off and crucified them and had them stoned.
[01:13:04.043 --> 01:13:05.624]  He killed hundreds.
[01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:07.044]  You understand?
[01:13:07.064 --> 01:13:16.827]  He became Paul, the Apostle Paul, the tent maker, who was later killed at the hand of the New World Order.
[01:13:17.487 --> 01:13:18.608]  So I don't want to hear it.
[01:13:18.688 --> 01:13:21.929]  I mean, please, you people are such hypocrites.
[01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:23.449]  It makes me sick.
[01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:25.110]  It took
[01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:43.255]  It took Charlie more courage than it would somebody with a spotless record like George Clooney, who I'd like to see talk about 9-11, and I know he knows about 9-11, that's all I'm going to say.
[01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:45.016]  He knows all about it.
[01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:49.379]  And I'd like to see, quite frankly, somebody I really respect.
[01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:53.903]  I'd like to see Mel Gibson come out and talk about 9-11.
[01:13:55.304 --> 01:13:56.245]  I know he knows about it.
[01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.631]  You want to get down to brass tacks on this?
[01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:01.492]  Charlie Sheen called me.
[01:14:01.752 --> 01:14:02.933]  He has the courage!
[01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:04.234]  He is to be commended!
[01:14:04.434 --> 01:14:05.935]  He's the one that has stuff to lose.
[01:14:05.955 --> 01:14:07.056]  He doesn't want me to talk about it.
[01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.277]  Do you have any idea what he has to lose?
[01:14:09.597 --> 01:14:12.619]  You know what happened to his father when he did anti-war stuff right before the war?
[01:14:13.099 --> 01:14:13.940]  What it cost him.
[01:14:16.301 --> 01:14:17.142]  That's all I'm going to say.
[01:14:17.182 --> 01:14:20.084]  You know, I could say a lot more, but if people don't want me to, I'm not.
[01:14:21.284 --> 01:14:23.646]  I mean, just watch somebody put it all on the line.
[01:14:24.514 --> 01:14:25.555]  And know what they're going to get.
[01:14:25.575 --> 01:14:26.916]  I know my listeners aren't attacking him.
[01:14:27.737 --> 01:14:43.970]  I get these sick neocon emails, and it's just dripping with, you're not a Christian because you had him on, and George Bush is lordly, and Charlie Sheen's a devil, or Charlie Sheen's a joke because he made mistakes in life.
[01:14:46.672 --> 01:14:53.478]  And half of them are probably on Prozac and got their kids on Ritalin, which is the same molecule as some of the stuff Charlie Sheen allegedly did.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.342]  A lot of you are out there drinking coffee today, just like I took a drink of Earl Grey tea just now.
[01:15:02.363 --> 01:15:04.944]  It's the same receptors as cocaine and heroin.
[01:15:05.265 --> 01:15:07.126]  Just stop being hypocrites.
[01:15:08.046 --> 01:15:08.626]  Stop it!
[01:15:09.747 --> 01:15:14.049]  But again, I'm speaking to dead ears because those idiots aren't listening.
[01:15:14.369 --> 01:15:14.990]  A few of them are.
[01:15:17.031 --> 01:15:17.751]  They're not listening.
[01:15:18.452 --> 01:15:20.733]  Again, they are in denial that Bush is anti-gun.
[01:15:21.468 --> 01:15:22.208]  It's admitted.
[01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:23.469]  Bob Barr has said it.
[01:15:23.489 --> 01:15:26.069]  The NRA has now admitted it.
[01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:28.390]  He is worse than Bill Clinton on the Second Amendment.
[01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.871]  And I have been confronted on the street by emails in gun shops.
[01:15:33.291 --> 01:15:37.452]  You better say, Alex, I appreciate some of what you do, but you need to back off.
[01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:38.732]  Bush isn't an anti-gun.
[01:15:39.893 --> 01:15:41.273]  I need to back off.
[01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:43.033]  You need to get your head out of the dirt.
[01:15:44.014 --> 01:15:44.874]  You just say something, Scott?
[01:15:48.155 --> 01:15:49.055]  Scott, did you just talk to me?
[01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:54.111]  Oh well, some feedback or something just cut in.
[01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:55.552]  I guess you sent me a feed or something happened.
[01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.493]  Anyways, I'm down in Austin, Texas.
[01:15:58.513 --> 01:15:59.193]  They're up in Minnesota.
[01:15:59.213 --> 01:16:00.373]  So I'm always on remote.
[01:16:00.413 --> 01:16:04.635]  I'm like a jet pilot flying around there talking to me from ground control to Major Tom.
[01:16:05.615 --> 01:16:07.756]  But I don't want to spend all day on Charlie Sheen.
[01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:09.197]  I've got a lot of other stuff to cover here.
[01:16:09.257 --> 01:16:13.359]  But you can only commend someone like him for his courage.
[01:16:15.387 --> 01:16:29.258]  And for getting his life straight, and then for having the nerve, when he's on top of the world with one of the number one TV shows in the country, two movies coming out this year, another movie coming out next year, one of the longest and biggest careers in Hollywood, and he's on the air saying this.
[01:16:29.338 --> 01:16:30.920]  And believe me, it's scary.
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.683]  Believe me, it's hard for people, especially people who've got something to lose.
[01:16:36.704 --> 01:16:40.067]  And it's more people like him, see, need to stand up, need to step up.
[01:16:40.968 --> 01:16:42.249]  We can beat the new world order.
[01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.574]  Look how many prominent people have already stood up.
[01:16:46.594 --> 01:16:48.235]  Look how many of them we've brought to you here.
[01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:51.076]  Professor Stephen Jones, BYU Physics Professor.
[01:16:52.337 --> 01:16:58.240]  Morgan Reynolds, Chief Economist for the Department of Labor for the current Bush, in his first administration, 2001-2005.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:05.923]  Ray McGovern, Chief Analyst for Ronald Reagan, giving him his briefings for four years, and George Bush Sr.
[01:17:05.963 --> 01:17:09.025]  for four years, saying the government is behind the terror.
[01:17:10.911 --> 01:17:11.551]  How many others?
[01:17:12.191 --> 01:17:18.874]  German Defense Ministers, members of the British Parliament, number three in the British government, resigned and exposed it.
[01:17:19.374 --> 01:17:30.658]  Michael Meacher, underwriting Laboratories, Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, Stanley Hilton, the Dean of the Defense Language School went public and said, I was forced to train some of the terrorists.
[01:17:30.878 --> 01:17:31.798]  The government did it.
[01:17:32.338 --> 01:17:34.419]  San Jose Mercury News never got picked up again.
[01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:36.720]  Never got picked up by other newspapers.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.081]  See, stuff gets out, but then it never gets picked up.
[01:17:39.101 --> 01:17:39.942]  It gets blocked off.
[01:17:40.282 --> 01:17:41.002]  It never grows.
[01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:43.044]  We take the stuff they ignore and we magnify it here.
[01:17:43.964 --> 01:17:45.365]  And it's up to you to do that.
[01:17:45.385 --> 01:17:46.506]  I mean, how many more are there?
[01:17:46.546 --> 01:17:48.667]  Call in when we get on open line.
[01:17:48.887 --> 01:17:51.709]  I know I've forgotten the hundreds of people that have gone public that are prominent.
[01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:55.631]  Ron Paul saying we're going into martial law.
[01:17:55.651 --> 01:17:57.832]  We're in danger of total tyranny, total takeover.
[01:17:58.233 --> 01:17:59.713]  Bob Woodward said the same thing.
[01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:02.255]  Even Sandra Day O'Connor has now said the same thing.
[01:18:04.697 --> 01:18:05.477]  So many others.
[01:18:05.497 --> 01:18:06.557]  There's so many now.
[01:18:06.577 --> 01:18:08.218]  Do you realize the danger we're in?
[01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:10.278]  It's time to stop playing around.
[01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.858]  It's time to stop kidding yourselves.
[01:18:12.298 --> 01:18:13.219]  We're in trouble.
[01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:19.940]  And me and Namby Pamby and dancing around the bush isn't going to get the job done.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.921]  We've got to take the bull by the horns and get in there at point-blank range and say, hey, we know you did it.
[01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:27.001]  We know you carried out the attacks.
[01:18:28.402 --> 01:18:30.742]  And we know your own documents say you were going to do it.
[01:18:31.579 --> 01:18:32.920]  You murder and trash!
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.302]  Don't you do it again!
[01:18:34.742 --> 01:18:36.724]  Don't you think you're going to get away with it for a minute?
[01:18:37.985 --> 01:18:41.368]  Noah said they've got an army of cowards that deep down know what I'm saying is the truth.
[01:18:41.628 --> 01:18:46.252]  So they're going to go defend this system in a frantic pace because they're afraid.
[01:18:46.292 --> 01:18:48.134]  They think if they serve it, they'll be safe.
[01:18:48.755 --> 01:18:50.576]  Cowards die a thousand deaths.
[01:18:50.656 --> 01:18:51.097]  Remember that.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.463]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:56.543 --> 01:19:00.747]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:03.769]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:03.969 --> 01:19:06.351]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:06.552 --> 01:19:15.199]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:15.399 --> 01:19:16.740]  The Brooklyn Light is different.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.084]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:21.844]  We're good to go!

[01:20:47.118 --> 01:20:57.003]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?

[01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:55.991]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.771 --> 01:22:02.393]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:22:02.433 --> 01:22:03.194]  Supreme Court.
[01:22:03.954 --> 01:22:08.255]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an I-Nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:22:08.295 --> 01:22:11.937]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:22:12.897 --> 01:22:18.119]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:22:18.948 --> 01:22:27.234]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:54.965 --> 01:23:06.349]  They railed against the crowd with another red-tag band.
[01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:11.520]  Declaring independence.
[01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:18.161]  Lay their bodies down.
[01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:19.542]  On a bloody wall.
[01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:23.803]  A liberty for their descendants.
[01:23:25.123 --> 01:23:28.164]  Thanks to the renegades.
[01:23:28.884 --> 01:23:30.104]  A free day.
[01:23:31.204 --> 01:23:33.465]  Thanks to the renegades.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:35.520]  Welcome back.
[01:23:35.861 --> 01:23:43.611]  This is how the Declaration of Independence closes.
[01:23:48.453 --> 01:24:05.442]  We therefore the representatives of the United States of America and General Congress assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions due in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare, they were signing their death warrants,
[01:24:05.962 --> 01:24:24.554]  That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved, and that as a free and independent state they have power to levy war, conclude peace.
[01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:45.821]  Contact, allegiance, and establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do, and for the support of this declaration, we, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.
[01:24:46.561 --> 01:24:49.942]  And then it starts with the signature of John Hempcock.
[01:24:52.423 --> 01:24:53.543]  And that's where we stand.
[01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:54.991]  That's where we stand.
[01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:57.593]  I mean, are you willing to stand up and say no to the New World Order?
[01:24:57.613 --> 01:25:00.515]  Or are you going to nitpick about who does it and how they do it?
[01:25:01.256 --> 01:25:01.956]  We don't have time.
[01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:03.077]  We've got to stand up now.
[01:25:03.717 --> 01:25:05.919]  Things are getting very, very dark, very, very quickly.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.981]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here?
[01:25:10.683 --> 01:25:11.443]  Who would I go to next?
[01:25:14.105 --> 01:25:14.586]  All right.
[01:25:15.226 --> 01:25:16.127]  Chris in New Hampshire.
[01:25:16.147 --> 01:25:16.687]  You're on the air.
[01:25:16.727 --> 01:25:17.128]  Go ahead.
[01:25:17.248 --> 01:25:18.529]  Yeah, you're on fire today, Alex.
[01:25:18.569 --> 01:25:20.010]  I just want to say thank you very much.
[01:25:25.367 --> 01:25:26.588]  That's funny, sir.
[01:25:29.449 --> 01:25:31.671]  I'm not quite sure what that means.
[01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:35.533]  Pardon me?
[01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:38.975]  What does that mean?
[01:25:40.416 --> 01:25:44.418]  Let him go, let him go.
[01:25:45.418 --> 01:25:49.961]  So many people have been, I don't know if he's been destroyed psychologically, but they have.
[01:25:50.001 --> 01:25:53.523]  So many young people I talk to are either awake or it's just giggling at everything.
[01:25:54.494 --> 01:25:57.055]  And then an act of fool and somehow everything will be alright.
[01:25:57.276 --> 01:25:58.336]  And maybe that's the response.
[01:25:58.376 --> 01:26:00.157]  Maybe that's good, sir.
[01:26:00.997 --> 01:26:06.660]  Maybe that'll get the uranium out of all of our lungs that's intensifying with every passing day.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.842]  I guess the globals did tell us they were going to kill everybody.
[01:26:10.562 --> 01:26:11.703]  So I guess they're really doing it.
[01:26:12.724 --> 01:26:14.925]  Let's talk to Joseph in England.
[01:26:14.945 --> 01:26:15.885]  You're on the air, Joseph.
[01:26:15.905 --> 01:26:16.466]  Thanks for holding.
[01:26:17.426 --> 01:26:17.846]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:18.126 --> 01:26:22.889]  Yeah, I think I get calls like that last one about two in the morning sometimes, but let's move on from that.
[01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:32.975]  Erm, yeah, I've basically been sort of helping spread the word just by sort of, you know, word of mouth kind of thing at work and it's been a kind of mixed bag of responses.
[01:26:33.195 --> 01:26:44.240]  I mean, I told the guy at work basically and he's well aware of the New World Order and he wasn't really that sort of excited at the fact that Charlie Sheen was talking about it because he knows about all the information anyway, but...
[01:26:44.824 --> 01:26:49.446]  I mean, if you talk to people that don't really know much about it, it gets the ball rolling with them.
[01:26:49.506 --> 01:26:52.408]  That's what's good about getting, you know, celebrities on board.
[01:26:52.448 --> 01:26:59.612]  Because, you know, most people watch, you know, hours of TV a day, but they do like zero hours of research into 9-11.
[01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:00.792]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:27:00.812 --> 01:27:02.813]  People are friends with their sitcom buddies.
[01:27:02.853 --> 01:27:04.034]  That's reality to them.
[01:27:05.175 --> 01:27:06.535]  And so it has a big effect, I agree.
[01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:08.256]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[01:27:08.576 --> 01:27:12.298]  I mean, I'm just sort of a local, you know, message boy in my own town.
[01:27:12.318 --> 01:27:13.659]  I've had a few sort of, um...
[01:27:14.116 --> 01:27:17.639]  Yeah, the typical stuff about him being a dope head, which he isn't.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.224]  Because he's a celebrity, does that mean he's the foremost authority?
[01:27:22.244 --> 01:27:23.405]  That's not the point.
[01:27:23.745 --> 01:27:29.170]  We're trying to use this to get the attention that it needs to the people.
[01:27:29.571 --> 01:27:33.014]  The point is he does have a lot to lose.
[01:27:33.935 --> 01:27:34.355]  Exactly.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:41.823]  At the end of the day, I mean, the elite love using celebrities like Bon Jovi and the Sugar Babes, you know, when they're chilling for globalism.
[01:27:41.863 --> 01:27:42.583]  Oh yeah, they've sold us.
[01:27:42.603 --> 01:27:43.364]  Why can't we?
[01:27:43.444 --> 01:27:50.067]  They've sold us that that's all that matters, but then they try to switch gears and say, when one of these people gets out of line, oh no, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:50.087 --> 01:27:51.368]  They try to slap them back down.
[01:27:52.488 --> 01:27:53.009]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:54.990]  It's total hypocrisy.
[01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:59.252]  I mean, somebody like Charlie Sheen, he was very informed.
[01:27:59.312 --> 01:28:01.313]  I had no idea he knew that much, to be honest.
[01:28:01.433 --> 01:28:03.034]  Oh, he knows a lot more than what you heard.
[01:28:03.754 --> 01:28:04.615]  Yeah, I'll bet.
[01:28:05.962 --> 01:28:07.564]  Obviously, I've got a lot to lose.
[01:28:07.644 --> 01:28:12.029]  I mean, he's basically, you know, losing the spotlight.
[01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:15.652]  Well, for the immigrants out there, I mean, how many of them were wild when they were young?
[01:28:17.254 --> 01:28:20.778]  I mean, I guarantee a lot of them sitting there talking trash need to think back to stuff they did.
[01:28:22.359 --> 01:28:22.960]  Anything else?
[01:28:23.897 --> 01:28:25.358]  No, I mean, that's basically it.
[01:28:25.378 --> 01:28:27.678]  You know, I think people should just get this story out, you know?
[01:28:27.758 --> 01:28:28.739]  Talk to people about it.
[01:28:28.779 --> 01:28:30.019]  Don't be afraid of ridicule.
[01:28:30.039 --> 01:28:30.660]  Just get it out.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:31.560]  Exactly.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:40.343]  It's a good way to get the foot in the door with a lot of people that don't even listen to the news, aren't even aware of, you know, that the planet's the third rock from the sun.
[01:28:40.703 --> 01:28:42.364]  They have no idea which end is up.
[01:28:43.464 --> 01:28:44.385]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.845 --> 01:28:46.506]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.386 --> 01:28:50.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:13.985 --> 01:29:15.546]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?

[01:31:58.595 --> 01:32:03.257]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:03.857 --> 01:32:08.178]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[01:32:21.487 --> 01:32:38.236]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:32:39.516 --> 01:32:42.398]  Let's continue with your calls, and then I will plunge right into the news.
[01:32:42.418 --> 01:32:44.079]  I'm going to take a few more, and we'll get right into the news.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.301]  I'll tell you, I keep getting my entire
[01:32:49.455 --> 01:32:50.676]  Call is scrambled here.
[01:32:50.736 --> 01:32:51.356]  Who's up next?
[01:32:52.377 --> 01:32:53.318]  Amy in Arkansas.
[01:32:53.358 --> 01:32:53.958]  You're on the air.
[01:32:53.998 --> 01:32:54.339]  Welcome.
[01:32:54.659 --> 01:32:55.279]  Hi, Alex.
[01:32:55.359 --> 01:32:56.200]  First time caller.
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:57.761]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:32:57.841 --> 01:32:58.682]  How may I serve you?
[01:32:59.162 --> 01:33:05.787]  Yes, this may be off topic, but I work for an engineering firm here in Arkansas, and there's a drafting and surveying department.
[01:33:06.107 --> 01:33:07.128]  Ma'am, there is no topic.
[01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.689]  We just did just a couple of phones.
[01:33:09.449 --> 01:33:17.175]  Okay, well the surveyors, the crew chief, he called me in there and he started telling me about how since Thursday their GPS equipment hasn't been working.
[01:33:18.132 --> 01:33:25.153]  And he said that he called their representative and the rep said that at least three or four states that they serve are having the same trouble.
[01:33:25.233 --> 01:33:28.294]  So it would include Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and maybe Kansas.
[01:33:28.334 --> 01:33:29.714]  He named off at least three or four states.
[01:33:29.734 --> 01:33:31.074]  They're all having the same problem.
[01:33:31.154 --> 01:33:32.034]  It's not been working.
[01:33:32.555 --> 01:33:36.475]  I heard about GPS tied in with radar having problems at some airports last week.
[01:33:36.675 --> 01:33:45.377]  Well, according to this guy, he told the crew chief here that the last time that they had trouble like this was right before we bombed Iraq.
[01:33:48.004 --> 01:33:49.425]  You know, that's speculation.
[01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:54.366]  You know, they were just kind of bantering about back here at the office about what it could mean.
[01:33:54.406 --> 01:34:04.130]  Well, we know the Russians use GPS jammers, and Iraq bought a bunch of those, and so all that happens is a precision-guided munition that isn't a laser target.
[01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:15.634]  I mean, the best type of precision-guided munition is you've got special forces with a special gun that projects an invisible laser that the scopes on the fighter bombers or bombers pick up.
[01:34:16.718 --> 01:34:31.505]  And then those are the best because if you're using GPS guided cruise missiles or GPS guided bombs, you turn on those GPS scramblers, all that happens is the bomb misses by a quarter mile and blows up a school instead of blowing up the military target.
[01:34:32.065 --> 01:34:36.047]  But I don't know if those GPS jammers would cause a global problem.
[01:34:36.767 --> 01:34:38.088]  I think they're just localized.
[01:34:38.635 --> 01:34:38.835]  Right.
[01:34:39.095 --> 01:34:39.916]  I don't know.
[01:34:39.976 --> 01:34:41.236]  I don't have any clue.
[01:34:41.256 --> 01:34:43.837]  I just know what this representative said.
[01:34:43.857 --> 01:34:52.701]  And don't ask me how it works because GPS is just a grid and then the cruise missile is honing in using that.
[01:34:52.721 --> 01:34:55.802]  But I guess it jams the cruise missile itself when it gets close enough.
[01:34:55.842 --> 01:34:57.423]  But who knows what's going on.
[01:34:57.603 --> 01:34:57.883]  Right.
[01:34:58.323 --> 01:35:01.865]  He just knows that three or four states are being affected and it hasn't worked since Thursday.
[01:35:01.945 --> 01:35:05.707]  According to him, the last time it had this trouble was right before we bombed Iraq.
[01:35:07.054 --> 01:35:10.196]  What they use and how it's used, you know, I don't know all the ins and outs of it.
[01:35:10.216 --> 01:35:11.117]  Well, that's scary.
[01:35:11.317 --> 01:35:15.600]  I bet if I do a search on it, we can find something if that's really going on, but that's interesting.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.020]  Anything else?
[01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:17.241]  Well, one other thing.
[01:35:17.281 --> 01:35:22.485]  We have a big situation going up here in Northwest Arkansas with the police.
[01:35:23.085 --> 01:35:30.891]  We had a, I guess he was 18 or 19, he escaped from some boys prison or something and he came down from Michigan in a high-speed chase.
[01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:32.732]  Michigan, Minnesota, I don't remember.
[01:35:32.832 --> 01:35:34.413]  Anyway, high-speed chase.
[01:35:34.433 --> 01:35:35.574]  He came down to this area.
[01:35:36.027 --> 01:35:37.608]  He was on the run for a few days.
[01:35:37.688 --> 01:35:40.850]  They thought they found him walking along the highway.
[01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:44.512]  The police made this guy that they thought was him get down on the ground.
[01:35:44.532 --> 01:35:49.114]  They told him, I guess, to show both of his hands, and he wouldn't do it or couldn't do it.
[01:35:49.454 --> 01:35:50.635]  And so they shot and killed him.
[01:35:50.695 --> 01:35:53.897]  Well, come to find out, it wasn't even the guy that they were looking for.
[01:35:53.977 --> 01:35:57.839]  And this guy was mentally retarded, and he didn't understand what they were asking him to do.
[01:35:58.679 --> 01:35:59.320]  So there's a big...
[01:36:00.185 --> 01:36:01.845]  to do here in Northwest Arkansas.
[01:36:01.885 --> 01:36:08.287]  Well, it's called the threat continuum and it's just horrible.
[01:36:08.327 --> 01:36:09.247]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:09.267 --> 01:36:15.689]  Let me comment on that off air so we can try to hurry here so I can get to the news before this hour ends.
[01:36:17.169 --> 01:36:18.589]  Here's the problem with that.
[01:36:19.469 --> 01:36:24.090]  I guess about once a year the Austin Police kill a mentally retarded man or woman.
[01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:26.271]  That's just where I live.
[01:36:27.973 --> 01:36:31.214]  And I have a good friend who is the manager of a Home Depot.
[01:36:32.595 --> 01:36:35.396]  I mean, he's a clean-cut, blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy.
[01:36:35.416 --> 01:36:38.538]  And I make that point because it's really bad when you're a minority.
[01:36:39.878 --> 01:36:46.161]  No criminal record, happily married, got paralyzed, I think it was in a car wreck, he said, about a decade ago.
[01:36:46.481 --> 01:36:47.742]  And this happened about four years ago.
[01:36:48.342 --> 01:36:49.062]  That's five now.
[01:36:51.403 --> 01:36:53.324]  And he got pulled over, supposedly speeding.
[01:36:54.344 --> 01:36:55.725]  We've interviewed him for the TV show before.
[01:36:56.576 --> 01:36:57.696]  He's been on radio, too, with us.
[01:36:59.017 --> 01:37:00.217]  And a really nice fella.
[01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:02.518]  I see him when I go to Home Depot every once in a while.
[01:37:03.298 --> 01:37:04.539]  He's the one I buy my house.
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:08.540]  And this all got written up, too.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.361]  This was in the news, and the cops defended it.
[01:37:11.882 --> 01:37:14.643]  Is it called quadriplegic when you're from the chest down?
[01:37:17.103 --> 01:37:19.084]  And it was a commander.
[01:37:19.144 --> 01:37:21.185]  It was one of the cops in the supervisor
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.303]  I guess they drive the big Ford SUVs.
[01:37:25.443 --> 01:37:26.244]  It's not the Explorer.
[01:37:26.264 --> 01:37:27.125]  What's the thing about that?
[01:37:27.405 --> 01:37:29.287]  It doesn't matter.
[01:37:30.748 --> 01:37:38.716]  And so this big cop, well known for liking to have big muscles and take the stuff that causes that.
[01:37:38.736 --> 01:37:43.040]  We know about the big law enforcement problem in America with the cops on the juice.
[01:37:44.085 --> 01:37:47.686]  He pulls this guy over, and I know this fella, and I have friends who are actually friends with him.
[01:37:47.706 --> 01:37:49.207]  He's very quiet, nice.
[01:37:49.227 --> 01:37:52.448]  He's a manager of a big, you know, they don't just put idiots in those positions.
[01:37:52.468 --> 01:37:53.028]  He's very calm.
[01:37:53.048 --> 01:37:53.668]  That's how I deal with people.
[01:37:54.389 --> 01:37:57.270]  And the cop comes over and goes, what is that on your steering wheel?
[01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:58.590]  And he goes, sir, I'm paralyzed.
[01:37:58.630 --> 01:38:06.873]  These are my hand controls, because it's like a, basically like a black stick sticking off of the, uh, and he's got levers and stuff to control the gas.
[01:38:07.333 --> 01:38:08.394]  And he says, get out of the car.
[01:38:08.414 --> 01:38:09.174]  And he says, yes, sir.
[01:38:09.214 --> 01:38:09.954]  My wife's right here.
[01:38:10.314 --> 01:38:12.155]  She'll need to get the wheelchair out for me.
[01:38:13.297 --> 01:38:14.938]  And he's driving an SUV.
[01:38:15.538 --> 01:38:22.222]  The officer said, pulls the gun out, puts it to his head, and he said, listen to me, you bleepin' bleeper, get out of the car right now!
[01:38:22.882 --> 01:38:24.943]  And he said, sir, okay, I will.
[01:38:25.644 --> 01:38:35.889]  He said, and starts opening the door, and then he can, you know, see, he's got little smaller legs, he can tell when somebody, you know, they're kind of... Any fool could notice this.
[01:38:35.929 --> 01:38:39.271]  And the cop's trying to slide in one hand, gun in the other, and he says, get out!
[01:38:40.619 --> 01:38:45.323]  And he said the cop was just wild, and I talked to other cops that know this cop, that is how he is.
[01:38:45.383 --> 01:38:47.604]  I mean, he just flies off the handle.
[01:38:47.864 --> 01:38:50.526]  He has rages, whether that's natural or not.
[01:38:52.027 --> 01:39:04.096]  And it was really embarrassing because by then, another cop pulls up and he grabs him by the hair and drags this quadriplegic out and starts slamming his head into the concrete, screaming and cussing, going,
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.461]  I mean, this is the psychopathic evil.
[01:39:11.162 --> 01:39:12.483]  And this guy's all bleeding and beat up.
[01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:16.865]  Of course, cops don't do any wrong, so let's just try to charge him with something while we're at it.
[01:39:20.067 --> 01:39:22.588]  And of course, all that made-up stuff got dropped.
[01:39:22.608 --> 01:39:23.409]  He didn't resist him.
[01:39:23.529 --> 01:39:25.710]  You know, the guy who can't walk resisted you.
[01:39:26.871 --> 01:39:27.931]  I mean, totally paralyzed.
[01:39:30.493 --> 01:39:32.154]  But the cop never got in trouble and got promoted.
[01:39:32.174 --> 01:39:34.055]  He's like some... I think he's like a captain now.
[01:39:34.095 --> 01:39:35.056]  I mean, he's like big time.
[01:39:36.516 --> 01:39:37.337]  And that's the message!
[01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:41.171]  And I know cops that know him.
[01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:44.073]  I mean, I've got quite a few friends that are on the Austin Police Force.
[01:39:44.133 --> 01:39:47.875]  And they say, oh God, he's a complete... He'll start fights with people in the locker room.
[01:39:50.237 --> 01:39:53.759]  I mean, he's running around starting fights with cops.
[01:39:53.799 --> 01:39:58.963]  There's nothing sicker than a big muscle head beating up on someone who's paralyzed.
[01:39:59.003 --> 01:40:02.845]  I mean, that is so... I mean, I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, but I am somewhat of a tough guy.
[01:40:03.746 --> 01:40:07.789]  And I would feel ashamed getting in a fight with somebody who was smaller than me.
[01:40:08.329 --> 01:40:09.670]  I'm not that big of a person, average.
[01:40:11.323 --> 01:40:15.487]  I don't know, I guess I'm kind of a husky like a gorilla, but... I mean, I would be ashamed.
[01:40:17.049 --> 01:40:19.091]  I would be just so ashamed.
[01:40:21.534 --> 01:40:22.655]  And they flip out.
[01:40:23.997 --> 01:40:29.863]  And there's the case out in California where the Army vet gets back, highly decorated, no criminal record.
[01:40:30.885 --> 01:40:32.406]  The cop follows him for a few minutes.
[01:40:32.446 --> 01:40:34.188]  At first they claimed he'd run.
[01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:41.374]  Well, I've been listening to the radio before and had a cop turn on his lights but be way back behind me and then finally pulls up beside you and you fall over.
[01:40:41.674 --> 01:40:43.736]  Then they yell at you and you explain, hey, I just didn't see you.
[01:40:43.756 --> 01:40:44.436]  I was listening to the music.
[01:40:44.516 --> 01:40:46.098]  Oh, okay, well, you can go.
[01:40:46.118 --> 01:40:47.859]  In fact, one time that happened, the guy was kind of embarrassed.
[01:40:47.879 --> 01:40:48.740]  He was a normal person.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.142]  So he was like, oh, well, just don't speed next time.
[01:40:51.162 --> 01:40:52.383]  Because he was embarrassed.
[01:40:52.805 --> 01:40:57.467]  Well, you get a crazy meathead, they're not going to, if they're wrong, they're just going to keep going with it.
[01:40:57.707 --> 01:41:00.908]  I mean, we've all done this in a parking lot or at a store or somewhere at work.
[01:41:00.948 --> 01:41:04.129]  We get mad, blow up at somebody, and then we feel ashamed and say, oh, sorry.
[01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:06.149]  Well, see, not with these nutcase cops.
[01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:11.331]  They just go further, see, when they throw a fit.
[01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:13.592]  I mean, none of us are perfect here.
[01:41:15.226 --> 01:41:19.630]  And all the time, you know, a retarded kid runs, shoot him three times in the back.
[01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:20.771]  On and on.
[01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:26.355]  But this case in San Diego got picked up, not by the squad car video, but by somebody else who was videotaping.
[01:41:26.395 --> 01:41:27.917]  Of course, the squad cars, they wouldn't release.
[01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:28.877]  I'm sure it was much worse.
[01:41:29.718 --> 01:41:34.342]  And he's down on the ground, got his hands out on the ground, and the officer says clearly, now get up!
[01:41:35.043 --> 01:41:37.324]  And he says, yes sir, officer, I'm on your side.
[01:41:37.365 --> 01:41:39.106]  He's probably been running checkpoints in Iraq.
[01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.267]  See what comes around goes around.
[01:41:41.374 --> 01:41:43.718]  He goes, yes sir, I'm on your side, I'm getting up.
[01:41:44.319 --> 01:41:47.023]  Stands up, hands up, and the cop shoots him a couple times.
[01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:54.255]  And they do this instinctive shooting training, which
[01:41:55.385 --> 01:42:00.750]  Back in the day when I had time to just lift weights and work 8 hours a day and go shooting at the shooting range.
[01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:03.292]  I went out a few times with Dr. Dillingham.
[01:42:03.332 --> 01:42:04.012]  We worked with my dad.
[01:42:04.052 --> 01:42:04.513]  Real nice fellow.
[01:42:04.533 --> 01:42:05.634]  I don't know if he lives around here anymore.
[01:42:05.834 --> 01:42:07.055]  Big, big gun enthusiast.
[01:42:07.595 --> 01:42:10.838]  We'd go out to Hill Country Rifle Range when Travis County had its training op out there.
[01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:12.740]  That would be Dallas, SWAT teams, Houston, Austin.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.744]  And I would go through the obstacles with them and the shooting contests they would have.
[01:42:20.171 --> 01:42:21.612]  Not bragging, it was kind of fun.
[01:42:21.712 --> 01:42:25.874]  I was always in... there might be a hundred people out there taking part and I'd usually be in the top seven.
[01:42:28.236 --> 01:42:31.518]  I guess it's because some of those guys are just so emotional with a gun or didn't grow up with it.
[01:42:31.538 --> 01:42:32.619]  I mean, I wasn't shooting that good.
[01:42:32.659 --> 01:42:33.379]  Usually I was kind of nervous.
[01:42:33.399 --> 01:42:39.783]  I've been around all these cops and going through these obstacles with a handgun and then going through with a shotgun and doing these obstacles over there.
[01:42:40.063 --> 01:42:42.284]  Probably cops listen right now and go, hey, I used to do that.
[01:42:42.304 --> 01:42:43.545]  I think I saw you out there.
[01:42:44.146 --> 01:42:45.546]  That's what I'd be doing if I had time.
[01:42:45.827 --> 01:42:48.408]  Fishing and shooting guns and hanging out with my family.
[01:42:49.249 --> 01:42:49.689]  But, uh,
[01:42:51.061 --> 01:42:52.321]  They're just so afraid.
[01:42:52.421 --> 01:42:53.722]  Police are so afraid, number one.
[01:42:53.762 --> 01:42:58.203]  Number two, they are taught instinctive shooting.
[01:42:58.243 --> 01:43:01.404]  As soon as the target pops up, it pops up, it's a woman with a baby.
[01:43:01.444 --> 01:43:03.644]  It pops up, it's a bad guy.
[01:43:04.425 --> 01:43:05.725]  And you shoot, you don't shoot.
[01:43:05.825 --> 01:43:07.786]  And it's instinctive shooting, and they teach you that.
[01:43:08.526 --> 01:43:12.067]  And the instinctive shooting is to turn off the thinking process so you're quick on the draw.
[01:43:12.787 --> 01:43:17.148]  Well, the problem is a lot of people just can't cut the mustard on that type of training.
[01:43:18.088 --> 01:43:20.449]  I remember watching cops shoot the woman with the baby.
[01:43:21.667 --> 01:43:25.668]  And quite frankly, a couple times I did it, I think I remember doing it once.
[01:43:26.388 --> 01:43:28.128]  Going through them all day, over and over again.
[01:43:28.148 --> 01:43:29.549]  But I saw cops every time doing it.
[01:43:30.469 --> 01:43:31.909]  I mean, they're just wild with a gun.
[01:43:32.329 --> 01:43:34.950]  And they're just, frankly, people who don't have a gun in hand.
[01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:36.230]  They're people that didn't grow up with it.
[01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:42.851]  Frankly, if you don't grow up with guns, and you don't grow up doing it a lot, you're just... It's really hard to get there.
[01:43:44.592 --> 01:43:45.832]  It's really hard to be good with them.
[01:43:45.972 --> 01:43:49.133]  And then some of these guys are just nuts that want to kill people.
[01:43:50.593 --> 01:43:51.393]  And it's scary.
[01:43:52.623 --> 01:43:58.430]  It's scary to see this and to know this is going on, and the officer says, now get up!
[01:43:59.511 --> 01:44:10.784]  And the officer is so shaky that he's got his finger on the trigger, and he pulls the trigger, and he shoots the American soldier, what was it, three times!
[01:44:13.726 --> 01:44:15.547]  For absolutely no reason.
[01:44:15.627 --> 01:44:17.108]  He did what the officer said.
[01:44:17.428 --> 01:44:19.549]  And then last time I checked, the officer doesn't get in trouble.
[01:44:19.809 --> 01:44:26.892]  I mean, in the past, that cop would be fired so fast, he'd be indicted for manslaughter so fast, it'd make his head spin.
[01:44:27.092 --> 01:44:29.694]  And then cops were careful, and cops kept other cops in line.
[01:44:29.934 --> 01:44:32.775]  And cops were respected and loved in this country.
[01:44:33.355 --> 01:44:34.176]  Not anymore!
[01:44:34.656 --> 01:44:36.697]  How did you go from being loved to being hated?
[01:44:37.958 --> 01:44:40.780]  Because you got put in positions that aren't what peacekeepers are.
[01:44:41.121 --> 01:44:42.582]  Aren't what guardians of the peace are.
[01:44:42.902 --> 01:44:44.383]  You're no longer peace officers.
[01:44:44.403 --> 01:44:46.905]  You're no longer lawmen.
[01:44:47.366 --> 01:44:51.649]  You are now law enforcers for the globalists.
[01:44:53.711 --> 01:44:56.133]  And I see cops changing tires every once in a while.
[01:44:56.153 --> 01:44:56.974]  It warms my heart.
[01:44:57.014 --> 01:44:59.095]  I want to, you know, give them an award.
[01:44:59.135 --> 01:45:00.256]  But do they really deserve that award?
[01:45:00.336 --> 01:45:01.037]  I've changed tires.
[01:45:01.077 --> 01:45:03.299]  My dad was almost annoying when I was a kid.
[01:45:03.359 --> 01:45:05.040]  He stopped at every person to help him.
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:07.042]  And even one time had somebody try to mug him.
[01:45:07.782 --> 01:45:09.464]  They didn't know who they were getting into it with, though.
[01:45:10.605 --> 01:45:13.827]  And, so I mean, is that really special?
[01:45:13.867 --> 01:45:15.169]  That's what police are supposed to do.
[01:45:17.751 --> 01:45:26.999]  I remember when I had a big wreck a year and a half ago, when we went into tornadic winds, and cops informed me, state police informed me, you just went through a tornado and torn everything up around us.
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:29.441]  Threw us off the road down into a gully.
[01:45:30.882 --> 01:45:34.846]  Really nice state police, really nice, helped us, really professional.
[01:45:36.514 --> 01:45:40.276]  And you go to big cities like New York or something, you compare that to the cops there.
[01:45:40.316 --> 01:45:41.916]  I mean, these guys are like monkeys.
[01:45:42.676 --> 01:45:46.158]  I mean, they're like psycho gorillas, or they're really nice professionals.
[01:45:47.538 --> 01:45:51.060]  Whereas the state police, I don't think I've ever run into one that acts like a monkey.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:57.322]  I mean, they might follow orders that aren't good and be doing bad things, but at least they don't act like power-crazed monkeys.
[01:45:58.222 --> 01:46:02.804]  Okay, see ma'am, you brought up a point, now I've been ranting about it for five minutes because it makes me so sick.
[01:46:04.341 --> 01:46:09.524]  I mean, to watch the video of him stomping that black 14-year-old boy to death in Florida.
[01:46:09.744 --> 01:46:11.025]  I mean, stomping his head.
[01:46:11.705 --> 01:46:14.346]  When he's in restraints, for no reason, just to punish him.
[01:46:15.127 --> 01:46:16.668]  He was in there for some petty offense.
[01:46:17.488 --> 01:46:24.352]  And then they have the local coroner say he died of a blood disorder, and they did another autopsy, and clearly he died of subdermal hematoma.
[01:46:26.993 --> 01:46:28.274]  That's a bigger crime to me.
[01:46:29.535 --> 01:46:31.176]  Murdering him was bad.
[01:46:31.196 --> 01:46:32.316]  It was manslaughter.
[01:46:32.496 --> 01:46:33.117]  I don't think they meant it.
[01:46:33.137 --> 01:46:33.617]  They were idiots.
[01:46:34.639 --> 01:46:36.100]  They don't know their own strength.
[01:46:36.821 --> 01:46:38.282]  That's a big problem with you guys.
[01:46:38.622 --> 01:46:39.683]  You don't know your own power.
[01:46:41.364 --> 01:46:45.367]  I guess you've never really been in anything until you get to that point where you kill somebody.
[01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:53.773]  But it's even worse to be a coroner and to lie about the murder of a child.
[01:46:54.894 --> 01:46:58.076]  To falsify, and to falsify your profession.
[01:47:00.538 --> 01:47:01.079]  It's shameful.
[01:47:01.099 --> 01:47:03.200]  And these crime labs that frame people all the time.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:03.921]  Huge revelations.
[01:47:05.316 --> 01:47:06.897]  Here's an article that dovetails with this.
[01:47:07.017 --> 01:47:10.340]  Jury finds Abu Ghraib dog handler guilty.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.022]  Associated Press.
[01:47:13.823 --> 01:47:23.852]  A jury found an army dog handler guilty Tuesday today of abusing detainees at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison by terrifying them with a military dog allegedly for his own amusement.
[01:47:24.373 --> 01:47:25.934]  Now I love that watered down version.
[01:47:25.974 --> 01:47:30.258]  There's photos of the huge bites everywhere and blood splattering all over the floor.
[01:47:31.678 --> 01:47:33.099]  The blood splattered.
[01:47:33.419 --> 01:47:36.701]  By the time they're done with it, they spin it down as just terrifying someone, menacing someone.
[01:47:37.041 --> 01:47:40.463]  Sergeant James J. Smith, 24, was found guilty of 6 of 13 counts.
[01:47:40.944 --> 01:47:45.266]  He had faced the stiffest penalty sentence of any soldier charged so far in an underground scandal.
[01:47:45.786 --> 01:47:50.869]  He could face up to 24 and a half years in prison and convicted of all counts.
[01:47:50.909 --> 01:47:58.714]  The 7 jurors, 4 officers, and 3 enlisted soldiers began liberating Friday after 4 days of testimony.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:09.906]  Now, it says they use the dog to intimidate prisoners for fun and compare it with another canine handler trying to make detainees soil themselves.
[01:48:10.027 --> 01:48:10.407]  What do you mean?
[01:48:10.467 --> 01:48:12.348]  It's admitted they bit on them, on purpose.
[01:48:12.829 --> 01:48:14.890]  Now, they were ordered to do all this.
[01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:15.491]  That's admitted.
[01:48:15.551 --> 01:48:17.212]  We have the White House own memos.
[01:48:17.292 --> 01:48:20.714]  We have them defending it today, saying, well, we don't call it torture.
[01:48:20.734 --> 01:48:24.838]  We can beat someone to death, and if it wasn't on purpose, it's not torture.
[01:48:25.558 --> 01:48:26.859]  Killing people isn't even torture.
[01:48:27.119 --> 01:48:29.281]  We can torture small children in front of their parents.
[01:48:29.321 --> 01:48:30.382]  John Yoo wrote the memos.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.622]  One of Gonzales' assistants.
[01:48:36.442 --> 01:48:38.384]  We have people like this running our country.
[01:48:39.564 --> 01:48:52.532]  And they give the orders, and then when their people get caught doing it, they send them England and Grainer and this latest creature, Smith, Michael Smith.
[01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.654]  Michael J. Smith, not right of the actor.
[01:48:57.015 --> 01:48:57.335]  I hope.
[01:49:00.217 --> 01:49:02.679]  And, uh, it's just, oh, you're going to prison.
[01:49:02.779 --> 01:49:08.344]  It was another case of a contractor in Afghanistan who they admitted was ordered to beat people and torture them.
[01:49:08.804 --> 01:49:11.946]  And a couple of them died, and so some good officers reported him.
[01:49:11.966 --> 01:49:12.507]  See, that's what happens.
[01:49:12.547 --> 01:49:13.427]  Good people report them.
[01:49:13.668 --> 01:49:14.949]  So then something's got to be done.
[01:49:14.969 --> 01:49:18.972]  You've got captains and colonels going, listen, they're killing people.
[01:49:19.412 --> 01:49:20.513]  And so they'll go grab him.
[01:49:20.593 --> 01:49:23.996]  And then when they tried to charge him and say he'd done it on his own, he released his orders.
[01:49:24.556 --> 01:49:29.380]  They declared national security, used the Patriot Act to gag him, and he got, I forget how many years in prison.
[01:49:30.578 --> 01:49:32.460]  So you take the gloves off, psychos.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.301]  I want you to know this.
[01:49:33.881 --> 01:49:39.086]  When you get caught doing it, then you're going to be hung out to dry for following your orders.
[01:49:40.427 --> 01:49:41.808]  I want you to understand that.
[01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:47.713]  I want you to consciously get it through your bug brains.
[01:49:47.854 --> 01:49:50.416]  We'll be right back with your calls in one more minute.
[01:49:54.358 --> 01:49:57.200]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:59.041]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:04.064]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.404 --> 01:50:11.148]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.468 --> 01:50:13.430]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:13.650 --> 01:50:16.492]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.592 --> 01:50:21.256]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.456 --> 01:50:25.859]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:33.325]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:13.028]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:51:13.268 --> 01:51:14.529]  to below detectable levels.
[01:51:14.829 --> 01:51:18.753]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:18.973 --> 01:51:25.498]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:25.738 --> 01:51:31.203]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:31.443 --> 01:51:38.388]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:51:54.318 --> 01:51:54.839]  We're good to go.
[01:52:09.662 --> 01:52:10.263]  I think so.
[01:52:29.946 --> 01:52:30.346]  I think so.
[01:52:56.292 --> 01:52:56.772]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.252 --> 01:52:58.773]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.293 --> 01:53:02.013]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:20.143 --> 01:53:25.104]  Hi, we're going to go back to your calls, Emmett and Mike and Fred and many others that are patiently holding here in just a moment.
[01:53:25.704 --> 01:53:33.406]  I want to implore you again to not procrastinate, to go to InfoWars.com and get the great little Citizen Rulebooks we carry.

[01:54:07.938 --> 01:54:09.519]  A little color cover booklet.
[01:54:09.559 --> 01:54:12.181]  It's great to give people, great to give your students, whatever.
[01:54:12.201 --> 01:54:13.081]  A lot of people are getting these.
[01:54:13.101 --> 01:54:14.082]  We're excited about that.
[01:54:14.102 --> 01:54:15.182]  We should have carried them years ago.
[01:54:15.503 --> 01:54:16.863]  We put one of these free in every order.
[01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:25.469]  If you get a DVD, say, Martial Law or Order of Death, or any of the books and other videos that we carry at InfoWars.com via the video and bookstore, you get one of these free.
[01:54:25.489 --> 01:54:28.490]  And on bigger orders, we throw in more, as well as some bumper stickers.
[01:54:29.651 --> 01:54:31.872]  Some InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com bumper stickers.
[01:54:31.913 --> 01:54:35.695]  So, please go to InfoWars.com and order or call toll-free.

[01:54:41.413 --> 01:54:43.154]  Basically just read to you what's on the back of the videos.
[01:54:43.634 --> 01:54:46.296]  And they can take your order if you call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:46.316 --> 01:54:47.017]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:54:47.037 --> 01:54:50.619]  And don't ever forget PrisonPlanet.tv until the end of this month.
[01:54:50.639 --> 01:54:51.619]  Now just a few days.
[01:55:01.508 --> 01:55:03.970]  You get almost a half year free when you sign up for a year.
[01:55:04.011 --> 01:55:06.953]  So basically pay for six months and you get 5.3 months free.
[01:55:07.714 --> 01:55:17.103]  Or you pay for 5.7 or excuse me 6.7 months and you get 5.3 months free.
[01:55:17.724 --> 01:55:19.586]  So over five months almost half a year free.
[01:55:19.626 --> 01:55:20.527]  Almost half off.
[01:55:21.888 --> 01:55:24.851]  Almost half off when you order.
[01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.873]  When you go and sign up, it's really fast, it's really quick.
[01:55:28.893 --> 01:55:33.758]  You get all my videos, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV show, all the good radio interviews.
[01:55:33.819 --> 01:55:34.519]  It's just all up there.
[01:55:34.539 --> 01:55:36.682]  It's a ridiculous deal, and it makes what we do possible.
[01:55:37.282 --> 01:55:38.684]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:38.724 --> 01:55:40.806]  That's PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:41.066 --> 01:55:42.608]  We're carrying a lot of new books and videos.
[01:55:42.628 --> 01:55:44.991]  Go peruse the shopping cart, check it out, or make the phone call.
[01:55:45.852 --> 01:55:47.433]  Let's go to Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[01:55:47.493 --> 01:55:48.014]  Emmett, welcome.
[01:55:50.529 --> 01:55:51.249]  Yes, Alex.
[01:55:51.349 --> 01:55:56.191]  I would hope that someday you have to be off, you would repeat the Charlie Sheen Show.
[01:55:59.212 --> 01:56:01.593]  And, um... What'd you think of it?
[01:56:02.534 --> 01:56:09.636]  Well, I had to be, uh... I had to be at a place... I'm 60 years old, and you know what happens to men at 60 years.
[01:56:09.736 --> 01:56:12.978]  I had to go be checked out, but I'm okay.
[01:56:12.998 --> 01:56:15.519]  You know, in the prostate gland.
[01:56:15.539 --> 01:56:17.740]  Okay.
[01:56:19.423 --> 01:56:20.764]  Anyway, I'd like to urge your list.
[01:56:20.864 --> 01:56:27.309]  I've been making copies of your DVD, Martial Law, over to tape for people, and they're baffled.
[01:56:27.329 --> 01:56:29.971]  Even bush worshippers, they're baffled.
[01:56:30.371 --> 01:56:31.912]  They don't argue.
[01:56:32.273 --> 01:56:38.057]  If they give it back to me, I would rather they pass it on, but they give it back to me, they just go, uh-huh.
[01:56:38.077 --> 01:56:38.917]  Which film is that?
[01:56:39.198 --> 01:56:39.998]  Martial Law.
[01:56:40.398 --> 01:56:41.099]  Yeah, it's a good video.
[01:56:41.159 --> 01:56:41.880]  It's our best.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:42.600]  They're baffled.
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:44.241]  They just go, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[01:56:45.458 --> 01:56:50.401]  I'd like to urge people, for sure, to get a Newswatch Magazine of David Jones.
[01:56:52.002 --> 01:56:53.923]  No, David Jones is my dad's name.
[01:56:54.703 --> 01:56:55.724]  It's David J. Smith.
[01:56:56.484 --> 01:56:57.605]  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
[01:56:57.785 --> 01:56:58.105]  Okay.
[01:56:58.785 --> 01:57:00.246]  Okay, yeah, David J. Smith.
[01:57:01.167 --> 01:57:02.808]  I just got a copy of it today.
[01:57:02.828 --> 01:57:05.169]  The Illuminati plan is working.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:17.347]  Hey, uh, they're putting up cameras on the Schuylkill Expressway to photograph cars that accidentally go through a red light or yellow... Yeah, now they're admitting all these federally paid-for cameras around the nation.
[01:57:17.487 --> 01:57:19.168]  Oh, we're gonna use it to watch you too!
[01:57:19.288 --> 01:57:19.869]  Yeah!
[01:57:19.889 --> 01:57:22.691]  It's the final kind of... Yeah, Marty, they're watching us.
[01:57:22.871 --> 01:57:23.951]  Okay, bye-bye.
[01:57:24.412 --> 01:57:25.392]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:57:25.432 --> 01:57:30.296]  We'll come back and start the third hour, take a few calls, and get a guest on for a segment, then get back into all this news.
[01:57:30.316 --> 01:57:30.776]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.263 --> 01:57:38.291]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.379 --> 01:57:50.039]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:51.741]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.462 --> 01:57:53.583]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.224 --> 01:57:55.024]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.805 --> 01:57:57.707]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.727 --> 01:58:01.090]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.551 --> 01:58:05.675]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.538 --> 01:58:10.880]  Well, we got a different, uh...
[01:58:11.836 --> 01:58:14.077]  Subject we'll be discussing coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:14.177 --> 01:58:14.918]  Some good news.
[01:58:15.358 --> 01:58:18.700]  Different locales around the country are throwing out the Animal ID Act.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:24.263]  And the state operation here in Texas is getting in a lot of trouble.
[01:58:24.323 --> 01:58:29.566]  People learn about what this Big Brother system for all your livestock and even your parakeet will really do.
[01:58:29.586 --> 01:58:30.826]  A thousand dollar a day fines.
[01:58:31.267 --> 01:58:33.188]  Got to ask permission to leave your house with your horse.
[01:58:33.288 --> 01:58:33.708]  You name it.
[01:58:34.989 --> 01:58:35.850]  Want to be slaves?
[01:58:35.890 --> 01:58:38.091]  Well, they're setting up a nice system for people that want to be slaves.
[01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:40.052]  So that's coming up for just one segment.
[01:58:40.072 --> 01:58:42.353]  I'm just going to have him on about 12, 14 minutes or so.
[01:58:43.073 --> 01:58:46.635]  And then we'll get back into this mountain of news I haven't even detailed yet.
[01:58:46.975 --> 01:58:48.316]  We've already covered quite a bit of it.
[01:58:48.896 --> 01:58:53.599]  Right now, let's go back to the calls and let's talk to Michael in New York and Fred Roy and others.
[01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:54.299]  Michael, welcome.
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:55.400]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:58.241]  Nobody deserves more commendation than you, Alex.
[01:58:58.261 --> 01:59:01.183]  You're the guy risking everything every day.
[01:59:01.975 --> 01:59:06.978]  With respect to Charlie Sheen, I am curious though, weren't they Clinton supporters?
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:16.524]  Yes, but Charlie really wasn't political then, and he's a gun owner, and he's more conservative than his father, I would venture to say.
[01:59:16.864 --> 01:59:17.205]  Okay.
[01:59:17.545 --> 01:59:22.948]  Now Alex, with respect to 9-11, Road to Tyranny, excellent work right there for sure.
[01:59:24.989 --> 01:59:25.750]  Caller, are you there?
[01:59:27.952 --> 01:59:28.273]  Hello?
[01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:30.118]  Yeah, your phone cut out for a second.
[01:59:30.138 --> 01:59:30.539]  Go ahead.
[01:59:30.559 --> 01:59:31.080]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:59:31.261 --> 01:59:36.094]  Okay, with respect to your 9-11 Road to Tyranny video, which is excellent work as well.
[01:59:36.957 --> 01:59:43.799]  In that segment where the FEMA trainer educating the police and the fire rescue guys.
[01:59:43.819 --> 01:59:47.340]  Says the Founding Fathers are bad terrorists and all Christians are enemies of the government.
[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:48.600]  Alex, you got it.
[01:59:48.740 --> 02:00:00.283]  That right there, that little blurb, if that could be posted on every site, all people need to see that and immediately they have the evidence of, hey, this is what our government, the people in our government... It's insane!
[02:00:00.323 --> 02:00:02.124]  They're talking like space aliens.
[02:00:02.644 --> 02:00:03.284]  It's unbelievable.
[02:00:03.304 --> 02:00:06.165]  And then I show a bunch of documents that are official that say it.
[02:00:07.205 --> 02:00:09.707]  Alex, they should be hanging from a tree limb just from that.
[02:00:10.127 --> 02:00:28.058]  Now last, if I may, you know, to prove how the Christians are so asleep, when in 99, when all the candidates were running for the Republican nomination and Bush got it, so through the debates on TV, live, the question is posed among them... That was actually in 2000.
[02:00:28.518 --> 02:00:29.719]  Okay, thank you.
[02:00:29.759 --> 02:00:36.183]  The question was posed among them about who influenced them the most in their lives, and when GW's turn to answer that,
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:38.721]  He tried to say Jesus, but he couldn't.
[02:00:38.761 --> 02:00:39.682]  He kept saying Jeh.
[02:00:40.142 --> 02:00:40.363]  Jeh.
[02:00:40.463 --> 02:00:40.523]  Jeh.
[02:00:40.543 --> 02:00:42.624]  It was like he was under kryptonite or something.
[02:00:42.664 --> 02:00:43.865]  He couldn't say Jesus.
[02:00:44.165 --> 02:00:46.227]  And to this day, he never says Jesus.
[02:00:46.827 --> 02:00:49.850]  And yet these Christians think he's so Christian, it's baffling.
[02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:50.850]  I know.
[02:00:50.890 --> 02:00:52.772]  I've seen that clip, and it was like kryptonite.
[02:00:54.473 --> 02:00:56.875]  It's like a vampire trying to kiss a cross.
[02:00:57.035 --> 02:00:57.635]  Exactly.
[02:00:57.675 --> 02:00:58.736]  You see it with your own eyes.
[02:00:58.796 --> 02:00:59.957]  It's exactly how it is.
[02:01:00.857 --> 02:01:01.637]  Alex, God bless.
[02:01:01.677 --> 02:01:02.178]  Great work.
[02:01:02.658 --> 02:01:03.018]  Thank you.
[02:01:03.118 --> 02:01:06.520]  Well, I appreciate the call and I appreciate the compliment.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:12.782]  Yeah, for those that haven't read the Charlie Sheen story we put out, there's two of them now in the audio interview, please get it out to everybody.
[02:01:12.842 --> 02:01:15.424]  I mean, the mainstream media is trying to block the story.
[02:01:15.444 --> 02:01:19.365]  I mean, can you imagine if Charlie Sheen had a crooked toenail?
[02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:20.226]  It'd be top news.
[02:01:20.266 --> 02:01:21.306]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[02:01:21.786 --> 02:01:28.109]  But he comes out cogently and covers 9-11 and much more, and it's just not a word said.
[02:01:28.509 --> 02:01:29.390]  Let's talk to Fred.
[02:01:30.134 --> 02:01:30.894]  In Pennsylvania.
[02:01:30.914 --> 02:01:31.515]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:01:31.935 --> 02:01:32.355]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:32.815 --> 02:01:32.955]  Hi.
[02:01:33.356 --> 02:01:35.317]  Actually, Indiana, but that's okay.
[02:01:35.557 --> 02:01:37.097]  Hey, you know, it's in the U.S.
[02:01:38.818 --> 02:01:46.162]  I just wanted to say, I've been a member of PrisonPlanet.tv for like five months now, and I still haven't downloaded all the videos you had up on there.
[02:01:47.622 --> 02:01:48.823]  By far, worth the money.
[02:01:48.943 --> 02:01:51.304]  So, I encourage everyone out there to go and get an account.
[02:01:51.324 --> 02:01:53.065]  Well, I appreciate the lavish plug.
[02:01:53.585 --> 02:01:54.085]  No problem.
[02:01:54.586 --> 02:01:55.346]  I wanted to ask you,
[02:01:55.785 --> 02:02:02.848]  I wanted to go to Indianapolis with some of your movies and a couple of government documents I printed out.
[02:02:03.789 --> 02:02:08.071]  Is there any law against me standing on a sidewalk and just handing these materials out?
[02:02:09.032 --> 02:02:11.675]  No, none of it is a public street.
[02:02:12.155 --> 02:02:20.102]  Some have unconstitutional laws against panhandling, but you just explained that it's free speech material and you really shouldn't have a problem.
[02:02:20.122 --> 02:02:21.964]  They're trying to train police to arrest you.
[02:02:21.984 --> 02:02:22.665]  They're trying to train them.
[02:02:22.685 --> 02:02:24.867]  There's no free speech, but it's not working.
[02:02:25.227 --> 02:02:29.291]  Yeah, because I come across that video of the protesters getting attacked by the police on your website.
[02:02:30.484 --> 02:02:33.807]  Yeah, they've done nothing, and that's up in D.C.
[02:02:33.847 --> 02:02:36.729]  at an anti-war rally, and they just attack them.
[02:02:36.789 --> 02:02:44.775]  I mean, in New York, I've got video where cops will run their bicycles into a crowd, just sitting there in a park, to then be able to beat them up and arrest them for assault.
[02:02:44.835 --> 02:02:50.259]  Imagine, the cop right on purpose, they're all just sitting there, just runs into them on purpose.
[02:02:50.279 --> 02:02:51.740]  I mean, it's called provocatory.
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:52.801]  Yeah, I've seen that video.
[02:02:53.525 --> 02:02:56.129]  Um, there was one other thing I wanted to bring up, like, two years ago.
[02:02:56.189 --> 02:02:57.311]  That was their trick in New York.
[02:02:57.331 --> 02:03:00.055]  They'd run into you, and then when they assaulted you, it was assault.
[02:03:00.476 --> 02:03:01.337]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:03:01.517 --> 02:03:04.081]  And there was, uh... See, in the past, cops just beat you up.
[02:03:04.693 --> 02:03:05.434]  You know, we got a break.
[02:03:05.454 --> 02:03:06.014]  Stay there, sir.
[02:03:06.234 --> 02:03:06.394]  Sure.
[02:03:06.615 --> 02:03:07.155]  We'll be right back.

[02:03:55.431 --> 02:04:06.657]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.997 --> 02:04:12.039]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[02:04:12.179 --> 02:04:12.719]  No problem.
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:19.604]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.804 --> 02:04:26.629]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:04:57.253 --> 02:05:05.160]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:12.366]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.586 --> 02:05:13.787]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:13.947 --> 02:05:17.328]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:17.388 --> 02:05:18.508]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:18.789 --> 02:05:20.069]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:20.269 --> 02:05:27.092]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:05:33.897 --> 02:05:38.101]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:38.201 --> 02:05:40.182]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:08.055]  Alright, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:08.455 --> 02:06:10.137]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:10.217 --> 02:06:12.098]  We've got this guest just for one segment.
[02:06:12.118 --> 02:06:14.481]  We appreciate him spending time with us.
[02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:27.792]  And he is, well, just doing an amazing job out there with other citizens fighting against this Big Brother takeover that even the big paper in Fort Worth reported.
[02:06:29.182 --> 02:06:48.221]  In Fort Worth, called it Big Brother Watching Your Cow, and then it admitted that satellite tracking systems via the cell towers that boost the signal will scan the RFID tag that must be put in all livestock, and if everything isn't done exactly as they say, $1,000 a day fines, you think the IRS is bad?
[02:06:48.241 --> 02:06:52.505]  This is a whole new layer of bureaucracy and the big meat packers and others
[02:06:53.746 --> 02:07:00.327]  Trying to monopolize the industry have openly lobbied and talked about this is to put small operators out of business.
[02:07:00.747 --> 02:07:02.168]  This is shut down the family farm.
[02:07:02.488 --> 02:07:10.329]  There's a lot of people got 10, 15 cows, 50 cows and they pay for upkeep of the tractor, they pay for their taxes with it.
[02:07:10.349 --> 02:07:11.930]  I mean I've got family.
[02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:17.611]  We are land rich, I guess money poor when it comes to our property.
[02:07:17.651 --> 02:07:21.572]  We've had from Spanish land grants back in 1829 there in Northeast Texas
[02:07:24.478 --> 02:07:28.199]  And it's just close to the town of Buffalo, south of Fairfield.
[02:07:28.839 --> 02:07:30.019]  And they need those cows.
[02:07:30.059 --> 02:07:36.521]  I mean, basically it just pays for the taxes and pays for putting new fences in every ten years or so.
[02:07:37.261 --> 02:07:38.481]  And it just pays the bills.
[02:07:39.041 --> 02:07:41.502]  I mean, you've got to do that just to keep your land.
[02:07:43.502 --> 02:07:48.083]  And then somebody gets cancer and over time you've got to sell land.
[02:07:50.726 --> 02:07:52.647]  And we don't have many farmers left.
[02:07:52.667 --> 02:07:53.568]  I'm sure you've heard that.
[02:07:53.628 --> 02:07:55.709]  But it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:56.570]  But I'm going to shut up.
[02:07:57.490 --> 02:08:01.793]  The good news is Texas County Farm Bureau rejects mandatory ID plan.
[02:08:02.213 --> 02:08:04.295]  Texas is moving towards rejecting it.
[02:08:05.055 --> 02:08:08.257]  The first state to pass a law adjoining the federal law.
[02:08:08.958 --> 02:08:10.159]  So we're in really deep trouble here.
[02:08:10.199 --> 02:08:11.840]  But the outrage has just been massive.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:18.764]  And long time dairy farmer and rancher Bob Parker explains why he proposed the resolution.
[02:08:19.204 --> 02:08:20.145]  And then he gets into it.
[02:08:22.458 --> 02:08:24.418]  So, Mr. Parker, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:25.439]  Well, it's a pleasure.
[02:08:26.179 --> 02:08:40.206]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and just what you're doing, ranching and farming, and what you discovered about the IDing process for the livestock, the premises identification as well, the National Animal Identification System.
[02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:47.129]  Well, just to give you a little background, I grew up in Kansas on a farm, moved to Missouri when I was 19, bought a farm here.
[02:08:48.234 --> 02:08:48.955]  I'm 49.
[02:08:49.015 --> 02:08:51.677]  I've dairy farmed and run beef cattle, still run beef cattle.
[02:08:52.478 --> 02:08:57.202]  I have about 700 acres that I farm and just stay busy on the farm.
[02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:58.423]  I sell real estate also.
[02:08:59.881 --> 02:09:04.223]  That's what farmers have got to do is work two or three jobs.
[02:09:04.643 --> 02:09:14.027]  All the farmers and ranchers in my family have to go in and work a job during the week, and then on the weekend they might work from sunup to sundown just to keep the family farm going.
[02:09:14.207 --> 02:09:14.907]  Well, exactly.
[02:09:15.488 --> 02:09:17.388]  When I dairied, I just worked the dairy.
[02:09:17.448 --> 02:09:21.150]  I didn't have time for anything else, but now with beef cattle, you've got to supplement that.
[02:09:22.130 --> 02:09:23.271]  My first love is the farm.
[02:09:24.652 --> 02:09:28.876]  I've been involved in a lot of groups and read a lot of magazines and try to stay informed.
[02:09:28.916 --> 02:09:31.578]  We're kind of out here in the Ozarks.
[02:09:31.638 --> 02:09:33.640]  We're kind of out of the mainstream here.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.284]  We're kind of kicking back in this rural lifestyle and enjoy it very much.
[02:09:38.324 --> 02:09:48.892]  About 30 days ago or so, I read this National Identification System plan on the USDA site and I'd heard this thing kicked around some.
[02:09:50.331 --> 02:09:55.653]  And just that they were talking about some kind of animal ID thing and didn't really have any details.
[02:09:56.473 --> 02:10:01.215]  It's to stop Al Qaeda, but the border's wide open.
[02:10:01.515 --> 02:10:02.896]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:10:02.956 --> 02:10:05.076]  It's just, you know, and nothing definite on it.
[02:10:05.096 --> 02:10:11.459]  Then I read, you know, about 30 days ago, I read this plan and it's like, my God, this is written by the Gestapo.
[02:10:11.519 --> 02:10:16.441]  I just can't even believe that this has been out there for a couple of years.
[02:10:18.227 --> 02:10:22.289]  Uh, time for the public to have input in it are basically over.
[02:10:22.329 --> 02:10:23.629]  They've already had their hearings.
[02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:28.411]  I really wasn't aware, you know, that this was really being discussed like it is.
[02:10:28.491 --> 02:10:30.151]  I mean, I've just, I was just horrified.
[02:10:31.812 --> 02:10:34.613]  Does it scare you to think all the other stuff you don't know about?
[02:10:34.633 --> 02:10:36.313]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:36.393 --> 02:10:42.616]  And, you know, you know, I basically, you know, kind of trust the government, give them the benefit of the doubt.
[02:10:42.656 --> 02:10:46.717]  I mean, I know there's, I know there's problems and, and, you know, I mean, you know, and,
[02:10:47.891 --> 02:10:56.716]  But then when you see this in black and white, what they're getting ready to do to the farm, you just realize how far things are digressing, how fast and how bad things are getting.
[02:10:57.616 --> 02:11:00.718]  And it's like, you know, I'm not going to take this anymore.
[02:11:00.758 --> 02:11:08.001]  I've got to get people informed about this because in our area, nobody's heard anything about the details of this plant.
[02:11:08.582 --> 02:11:13.424]  So I've been writing and talking to people and basically creating habits.
[02:11:13.996 --> 02:11:16.617]  With our elected officials, I think it's time to educate them.
[02:11:16.757 --> 02:11:17.738]  You're a Paul Revere.
[02:11:17.778 --> 02:11:24.640]  For those that don't know what's in the plan, and I'm actually... I mean, I actually have the federal regulations.
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.482]  I have the Texas state law here in my hands, and I have their own handouts.
[02:11:27.822 --> 02:11:29.022]  I mean, this is official.
[02:11:29.322 --> 02:11:29.923]  What they're going to do?
[02:11:29.963 --> 02:11:30.683]  Tell people about it.
[02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.624]  Yeah, well, I mean, they're going to ID all livestock.
[02:11:34.664 --> 02:11:36.765]  They're going to put a transmitter and everything.
[02:11:36.845 --> 02:11:40.767]  It's going to... You know, it's supposed to be read from 30 inches away.
[02:11:41.443 --> 02:11:47.144]  Everything's going to be required to, you know, receive this ID according to the plan.
[02:11:48.805 --> 02:11:50.865]  You know, it's going to be made mandatory.
[02:11:50.985 --> 02:11:59.467]  The timeline is, let's see here, that by January 2008, premises registration and animal ID is required.
[02:11:59.507 --> 02:12:00.367]  That's mandatory.
[02:12:00.427 --> 02:12:02.208]  And that's when we get our national ID cards.
[02:12:02.228 --> 02:12:04.468]  Did you know your state driver's license is already federal?
[02:12:05.788 --> 02:12:07.169]  Well, I know I had to take my
[02:12:09.913 --> 02:12:14.876]  Oh my, when you travel my, not my visa, but my... Driver's license?
[02:12:15.076 --> 02:12:15.396]  No.
[02:12:16.336 --> 02:12:16.796]  Passport?
[02:12:17.137 --> 02:12:18.117]  Yeah, my passport in.
[02:12:18.137 --> 02:12:20.918]  When I got my driver's license last week, they had to have my passport.
[02:12:20.998 --> 02:12:22.459]  So I know there's changes in there.
[02:12:22.479 --> 02:12:26.441]  They're going to add a tracker chip to all the licenses and a face scan and a thumb scan.
[02:12:26.741 --> 02:12:30.823]  Texas has been doing it with the face scan and the thumb scan since 93.
[02:12:31.483 --> 02:12:34.925]  Yeah, I mean it's just, you know, it's just incredible.
[02:12:34.965 --> 02:12:35.525]  But you know, in 2009,
[02:12:37.279 --> 02:12:37.820]  I don't know.
[02:12:54.153 --> 02:12:57.134]  And from what I can gather, they don't seem to be making any changes.
[02:12:57.175 --> 02:13:01.897]  And then if your cow gets struck by lightning, or coyotes kill a calf, you've got to report that.
[02:13:01.937 --> 02:13:07.279]  If you don't, thousands of dollars of fine, jail time, little inspectors coming to your house all the time.
[02:13:07.459 --> 02:13:07.860]  Exactly.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:13.662]  And you know, I've talked to people about this, and I've argued with people that support this.
[02:13:13.803 --> 02:13:18.185]  Like, you know, we've just got to have this, because all these diseases are getting ready to, you know, defend upon us.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:19.740]  We're good to go.
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:33.881]  Care for, you know, this so-called security.
[02:13:33.921 --> 02:13:36.602]  I mean, they admit this isn't going to really stop any disease.
[02:13:36.803 --> 02:13:48.128]  Did you know that the real data shows that almost all the disease is coming from big agri-feedlots and, you know, massive chicken coops with a million chickens in one building?
[02:13:49.108 --> 02:13:50.489]  And they're the ones lobbying for this.
[02:13:50.729 --> 02:13:52.110]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:57.292]  You know, small agriculture, guys like me, you know, with 50 cows and smaller
[02:13:57.762 --> 02:13:59.943]  You know, we're the guys that are going to take it on the chin with this.
[02:13:59.963 --> 02:14:01.504]  We've got ID everything.
[02:14:01.764 --> 02:14:03.025]  Well, that's what they're longing for.
[02:14:03.325 --> 02:14:03.725]  What's that?
[02:14:04.205 --> 02:14:12.610]  They've said in some of the policy documents of the corporations, I don't know if you've seen these, but it's been written about, that this is meant to add a layer of regulation to knock you guys out.
[02:14:12.650 --> 02:14:13.891]  They admit it.
[02:14:13.971 --> 02:14:14.451]  Exactly.
[02:14:14.991 --> 02:14:19.794]  I've even had local guys tell me, we need to get rid of these small producers, they're not good for the industry.
[02:14:20.274 --> 02:14:22.955]  I'm like, you're talking about people that raise their own food.
[02:14:22.995 --> 02:14:24.296]  Are you out of your mind?
[02:14:24.616 --> 02:14:25.937]  You know, this is America.
[02:14:26.317 --> 02:14:27.078]  You know, have we lost?
[02:14:27.118 --> 02:14:28.198]  Well, see, this is what happens.
[02:14:28.218 --> 02:14:31.420]  There's all these scumbags who've got 50, 100 cows.
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:36.923]  They associate themselves with a ConAgra or something that, you know, slaughtering millions a year.
[02:14:37.503 --> 02:14:41.085]  And then, yeah, we got to get rid of the little guys.
[02:14:41.165 --> 02:14:42.926]  And no, you're the little guy.
[02:14:43.206 --> 02:14:43.666]  You're right.
[02:14:43.686 --> 02:14:45.507]  They don't realize they're going to be the little guy.
[02:14:45.567 --> 02:14:49.049]  It's going to be all the really big guys that are going to control the whole thing.
[02:14:49.867 --> 02:15:00.395]  But, you know, we're talking about our people, their ability to raise their own food without government fees and costs and restrictions.
[02:15:00.415 --> 02:15:01.996]  I mean, to grow your own food.
[02:15:02.076 --> 02:15:04.377]  Well, sir, you did more than talk about it.
[02:15:04.397 --> 02:15:10.582]  You took the bull by the horns, pun intended, and you marched in there and you got your county to pass a resolution saying, we're not going to do this.
[02:15:10.782 --> 02:15:11.222]  Well, I did.
[02:15:11.262 --> 02:15:17.066]  We had a knock-down, drag-out meeting in our last, you know, when we got together, our Farm Bureau Board.
[02:15:18.448 --> 02:15:22.391]  I just wanted to say that we reject it.
[02:15:22.751 --> 02:15:27.315]  It was about blood on the floor, but it did pass.
[02:15:27.615 --> 02:15:40.964]  I think everybody out there should take some kind of resolution and take it to their local city council, take it to the Farm Bureau boards, take it to their commissioners.
[02:15:41.024 --> 02:15:44.447]  Get everybody to adopt a resolution opposing this.
[02:15:45.681 --> 02:15:48.325]  Not all are, but at least they're going to become aware.
[02:15:48.885 --> 02:15:50.788]  But that's something everybody could do.
[02:15:50.848 --> 02:15:55.975]  They could take a resolution, get your local political party to pass a resolution against it if you can.
[02:15:57.657 --> 02:16:01.603]  Mr. Parker, this is a great idea you've got, and that's exactly what we're doing.
[02:16:02.875 --> 02:16:04.756]  But all wealth comes from the land.
[02:16:05.176 --> 02:16:06.277]  And this is feudalism.
[02:16:06.297 --> 02:16:07.057]  This is serfdom.
[02:16:07.137 --> 02:16:07.917]  Make no mistake.
[02:16:08.717 --> 02:16:10.898]  They've openly announced they're getting us off the land.
[02:16:10.918 --> 02:16:12.739]  They only want big agribusiness out there.
[02:16:13.519 --> 02:16:14.220]  Yeah.
[02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:20.002]  And I've fought for the small farmer ever since I've been a small farmer.
[02:16:20.522 --> 02:16:21.362]  We're disappearing.
[02:16:23.023 --> 02:16:25.444]  We're going to be the next endangered species.
[02:16:26.124 --> 02:16:26.864]  We nearly are.
[02:16:27.945 --> 02:16:29.465]  I sell real estate down here in the Ozarks.
[02:16:29.485 --> 02:16:31.026]  There's very few people coming in here
[02:16:32.115 --> 02:16:47.766]  It's sad to see communities dying, and of course as they get bigger and bigger, those big predatory, which are really medium-sized farms, they're just going to be working with the government to shut down the small ones.
[02:16:48.987 --> 02:16:51.729]  Little Jay Johnson over there didn't tag all of them.
[02:16:51.769 --> 02:16:53.550]  He had his horse out without scanning it.
[02:16:53.791 --> 02:16:55.792]  You're going to go to jail for a year, boy.
[02:16:55.812 --> 02:16:57.473]  Get my deputy over there.
[02:16:57.653 --> 02:17:00.295]  We don't cotton the free graders around here.
[02:17:01.796 --> 02:17:04.037]  Yeah, that's really what you're looking at.
[02:17:04.097 --> 02:17:07.119]  It's unbelievable as this sounds, what we're talking about.
[02:17:07.139 --> 02:17:12.162]  I mean, if somebody just turns into this and says, God, these guys are nuts talking about this stuff.
[02:17:12.502 --> 02:17:17.665]  You know, get on the USDA site and read in black and white what they are proposing.
[02:17:17.845 --> 02:17:19.786]  It is absolutely unbelievable.
[02:17:19.926 --> 02:17:23.048]  That's what business is now in the modern corrupt America.
[02:17:23.068 --> 02:17:25.249]  It isn't so much the product, it's monopolies.
[02:17:26.229 --> 02:17:27.770]  And so that's what these companies do.
[02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:28.871]  Tell you what, sir.
[02:17:30.553 --> 02:17:31.875]  Can you stay with us for one more segment?
[02:17:31.895 --> 02:17:33.537]  We've got a little break here.
[02:17:33.557 --> 02:17:34.999]  We'll come back with you for five more minutes.
[02:17:35.159 --> 02:17:36.681]  And then I'm going to cover the news.
[02:17:36.701 --> 02:17:38.283]  We'll get back after that and take your calls, everybody.
[02:17:38.743 --> 02:17:39.864]  This is so important.
[02:17:40.726 --> 02:17:41.767]  It's called feudalism.
[02:17:41.907 --> 02:17:43.329]  We're going into slavery right now.
[02:17:45.396 --> 02:17:50.678]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:17:50.878 --> 02:17:52.959]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:17:53.199 --> 02:18:00.321]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:18:00.441 --> 02:18:11.965]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:18:12.365 --> 02:18:19.750]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[02:18:20.010 --> 02:18:25.014]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:18:25.134 --> 02:18:30.157]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:18:30.437 --> 02:18:35.821]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:35.841 --> 02:18:37.062]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:38.362]  That's toll-free, triple
[02:18:44.406 --> 02:18:46.287]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.367 --> 02:18:51.149]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:51.309 --> 02:18:59.092]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:59.372 --> 02:19:04.716]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:19:04.937 --> 02:19:11.962]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:12.243 --> 02:19:17.567]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:19:17.847 --> 02:19:22.531]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:19:22.891 --> 02:19:30.520]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:37.087]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:19:37.407 --> 02:19:38.449]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.689]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:47.970 --> 02:19:55.352]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:56.432 --> 02:20:06.115]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:07.015 --> 02:20:13.597]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:23.422]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:20:24.022 --> 02:20:25.503]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.523 --> 02:20:25.843]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.863 --> 02:20:26.023]  Call now.
[02:20:26.043 --> 02:20:31.404]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:44.562 --> 02:20:46.644]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:20:46.844 --> 02:20:49.086]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:20:49.386 --> 02:20:50.066]  New toenails?
[02:20:50.447 --> 02:20:51.428]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:20:52.428 --> 02:20:55.110]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:20:55.631 --> 02:20:57.072]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:20:57.092 --> 02:20:59.874]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:21:00.094 --> 02:21:01.496]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:21:01.916 --> 02:21:03.577]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:21:03.757 --> 02:21:05.118]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:21:05.158 --> 02:21:07.981]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:21:08.181 --> 02:21:09.402]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:21:09.987 --> 02:21:11.028]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:11.508 --> 02:21:15.572]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:21:16.292 --> 02:21:17.193]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:21:17.433 --> 02:21:19.995]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:21:20.256 --> 02:21:21.917]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:21:22.397 --> 02:21:25.440]  Now you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:26.420]  You bet!
[02:21:26.641 --> 02:21:30.723]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:21:30.743 --> 02:21:32.424]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:32.804 --> 02:21:33.945]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:34.125 --> 02:21:35.786]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[02:21:36.146 --> 02:21:41.249]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[02:21:41.449 --> 02:21:42.470]  In the foot care section.
[02:21:55.908 --> 02:21:58.568]  Long time dairy farmer and rancher, Bob Parker.
[02:21:59.508 --> 02:22:04.750]  He led this counter-assault against the Consolidators.
[02:22:04.770 --> 02:22:06.270]  They want to run us all off the land.
[02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:08.331]  That's their own stated policy and goal.
[02:22:08.771 --> 02:22:09.991]  Total control monopoly.
[02:22:10.011 --> 02:22:14.592]  And they use their PR machines to convince us to all stand down and go along with it.
[02:22:14.632 --> 02:22:18.113]  But they got it thrown out in their Farm Bureau up in Texas County, Missouri.
[02:22:18.593 --> 02:22:19.894]  And they're on the run here in Texas.
[02:22:19.914 --> 02:22:21.194]  They passed it here.
[02:22:22.427 --> 02:22:24.208]  And the fight continues on.
[02:22:24.268 --> 02:22:32.752]  And reading through these documents, their own documents, they say, oh, we'll make it voluntary the first two years and then have it kick in as mandatory.
[02:22:32.772 --> 02:22:34.673]  That's the way to get people to go along with it.
[02:22:34.994 --> 02:22:41.797]  And they're really deceptive and sneaky and they dispatch their minions all over the country to come talk to local farm bureaus and lie to you guys, don't they?
[02:22:41.817 --> 02:22:43.338]  That's exactly right.
[02:22:43.378 --> 02:22:48.841]  I mean, you know, they've talked about this voluntary plan and Farm Bureau supported voluntary plan.
[02:22:49.714 --> 02:22:56.419]  And then when I read the actual document, and that's part of the plan, that it's just exactly like you said, it's voluntary and goes to mandatory.
[02:22:56.439 --> 02:23:01.842]  I'm like, how can you call a program like that voluntary if it goes to mandatory?
[02:23:03.103 --> 02:23:07.266]  But that's how you get everybody sucked in, and they're already passing out these papers.
[02:23:07.326 --> 02:23:08.987]  Register your farms now.
[02:23:09.507 --> 02:23:10.948]  Give them their GPS coordinates.
[02:23:10.968 --> 02:23:13.790]  I mean, it's just an outrage.
[02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:15.811]  They're just boiling the frog slowly.
[02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:23.606]  I see where it's going, and a whole bunch of other people do too, and it's just time to stand up and yell about it.
[02:23:23.626 --> 02:23:25.969]  This is serious stuff!
[02:23:28.793 --> 02:23:40.945]  It's going to add a lot of cost on just initially to the price of these farm-raised cattle and chickens and other things that are grown out there as you farmers say.
[02:23:41.706 --> 02:23:45.970]  And then once it causes a greater consolidation, that will really spike prices.
[02:23:46.270 --> 02:23:46.991]  Well, exactly.
[02:23:50.410 --> 02:23:54.571]  The ability of people to produce their own food and it's just in the hands of a few of the giants.
[02:23:54.591 --> 02:23:57.671]  We're going to be asking them how much food is.
[02:23:57.911 --> 02:23:59.832]  Well, their operatives and lackeys are everywhere.
[02:23:59.852 --> 02:24:06.353]  Did you run into any of their minions trying to stop you from doing this?
[02:24:06.513 --> 02:24:08.813]  It's just unbelievable what I've been through.
[02:24:09.253 --> 02:24:15.654]  I've been told since our meeting that the vote was illegal and blah, blah, blah.
[02:24:15.694 --> 02:24:18.855]  I've had some of my news releases stopped from coming out in papers.
[02:24:19.833 --> 02:24:26.598]  And we're going to have another real interesting board meeting next month, because the people that oppose it are just extremely opposed to it.
[02:24:26.618 --> 02:24:27.739]  But I'm not stopping.
[02:24:27.779 --> 02:24:28.520]  I mean, they don't get it.
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:31.322]  This isn't something that I can back on.
[02:24:31.342 --> 02:24:34.224]  This is for everything that I believe in.
[02:24:35.985 --> 02:24:42.911]  As a Christian, as a believer, when you see about the mark, you can't buy and sell without a mark.
[02:24:43.311 --> 02:24:48.195]  And I know very few people really seem to pay attention to that anymore, other than real believers.
[02:24:48.874 --> 02:24:51.817]  You know, this isn't the mark.
[02:24:51.857 --> 02:24:53.739]  This isn't on my forehead or my right hand.
[02:24:53.819 --> 02:24:55.040]  But it's a big step towards it.
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.341]  It's a big step towards it.
[02:24:56.401 --> 02:24:57.542]  It's leading right into it.
[02:24:57.823 --> 02:25:00.285]  You get all the animals ID'd.
[02:25:00.325 --> 02:25:01.466]  You can't buy or sell them.
[02:25:01.506 --> 02:25:03.228]  You get all the pets ID'd.
[02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:04.850]  It's going to be a real small step.
[02:25:07.224 --> 02:25:12.312]  Well, it's simple, Mr. Parker, and you know this.
[02:25:12.612 --> 02:25:15.136]  Throughout history, elites never want the people to have land.
[02:25:15.176 --> 02:25:15.857]  That's freedom.
[02:25:17.339 --> 02:25:20.104]  That's the capacity to be sovereign, to be independent.
[02:25:20.832 --> 02:25:25.595]  And humans' entire history is the struggle to keep land and have land.
[02:25:26.376 --> 02:25:27.757]  It is the icon of liberty.
[02:25:27.797 --> 02:25:29.818]  That's what the wealth and liberty grows out of.
[02:25:29.918 --> 02:25:30.218]  Exactly.
[02:25:30.279 --> 02:25:31.619]  And you talk about the Bible.
[02:25:31.639 --> 02:25:32.320]  That's in the Bible.
[02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:40.365]  And it's being taken from us right now under a myriad of different attacks and guises and phony environmentalism and land grabs and all of it.
[02:25:40.385 --> 02:25:40.946]  Well, exactly.
[02:25:41.046 --> 02:25:42.066]  And now here comes this.
[02:25:43.527 --> 02:25:48.691]  You know, anybody who loves our country and loves the land and loves
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:51.140]  You know, it loves everything that we have here.
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:53.221]  It's got to stand up on this issue.
[02:25:53.681 --> 02:25:54.741]  You can't wait anymore.
[02:25:54.801 --> 02:26:00.183]  You've got to stand up on this issue and, you know, and oppose this with everything you've got.
[02:26:00.203 --> 02:26:07.545]  Well, I have meetings here in Texas where the state board, the legislature passed an unconstitutional law and just said, the board is given unlimited authority.
[02:26:07.865 --> 02:26:14.626]  Then the board with all their big, you know, agri connections, big money connections, conflict of interest, just says, okay, you've got to do this.
[02:26:14.666 --> 02:26:16.187]  We're making it illegal right now.
[02:26:17.287 --> 02:26:28.594]  You know, starting in just a few months, so everybody gets upset, and they have a few meetings, and there's 500 people there, and one person there is for it, everybody else is against it, so then they just cancel the public meetings.
[02:26:29.054 --> 02:26:31.616]  Right, right.
[02:26:31.716 --> 02:26:42.462]  You know, they've created these bureaucracies, you know, they're not elected officials, the people don't really get a voice, they just create these bureaucracies, they give them some enabling legislation somewhere,
[02:26:42.972 --> 02:26:43.473]  I think so.
[02:27:03.249 --> 02:27:08.612]  A little guy down here in Missouri, you know, and it finally got to this issue affects all us little guys.
[02:27:08.732 --> 02:27:11.493]  I mean, you know, it's just incredible.
[02:27:11.513 --> 02:27:12.954]  Listen, I want to stay in contact with you.
[02:27:13.074 --> 02:27:14.975]  Are you going to take your fight at the state level now?
[02:27:15.815 --> 02:27:16.595]  Yeah, we're working.
[02:27:16.796 --> 02:27:20.857]  We have a state resolution that they're probably going to pass opposing it.
[02:27:20.917 --> 02:27:22.098]  Now, Tennessee did that.
[02:27:22.178 --> 02:27:23.379]  We're trying to get that done here.
[02:27:23.579 --> 02:27:24.339]  Good job.
[02:27:24.459 --> 02:27:25.440]  Good job.
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:28.261]  We're fighting it as far as, you know, we're going to fight it all the way.
[02:27:28.321 --> 02:27:29.041]  We've got to win.
[02:27:29.201 --> 02:27:29.802]  We're out of time.
[02:27:29.842 --> 02:27:30.682]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:27:35.569 --> 02:27:38.558]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:28:51.694 --> 02:28:57.858]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.138 --> 02:29:06.583]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.824 --> 02:29:13.828]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.148 --> 02:29:18.951]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.171 --> 02:29:24.595]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:24.915 --> 02:29:27.997]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.338 --> 02:29:36.243]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.343 --> 02:29:36.903]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.009 --> 02:29:49.074]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:49.274 --> 02:29:52.679]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:52.859 --> 02:29:56.303]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:56.576 --> 02:29:59.838]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:59.858 --> 02:30:05.320]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:14.985]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.105 --> 02:30:16.425]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:16.445 --> 02:30:21.888]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:22.288 --> 02:30:28.290]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:31.892]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:31.912 --> 02:30:32.912]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:51.203 --> 02:30:59.709]  Alright, Roy and Bob and other callers that are patiently holding, we're going to get your calls, cover some more news before this broadcast ends, here in about 26 minutes.
[02:31:13.689 --> 02:31:16.471]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:27.959]  I haven't had her on in a couple of weeks, and she's Debbie Morrow, and she just takes the calls from the radio interviews they do for New Millennium Concepts.
[02:31:27.979 --> 02:31:33.682]  They're the national distributor and manufacturer of the American Berkey, the big Berkey, with the black elements.
[02:31:33.702 --> 02:31:37.005]  They also carry the British Berkeys, if you would prefer those, but the U.S.
[02:31:37.025 --> 02:31:40.827]  design is a new standard, according to the universities that did the studies on it.
[02:31:41.247 --> 02:31:42.108]  Non-detectable.
[02:31:42.128 --> 02:31:43.389]  There's just nothing in the water.
[02:31:44.029 --> 02:31:46.131]  Once it goes through there, it just cuts it all out.
[02:31:46.552 --> 02:31:48.213]  They have so many other great products.
[02:31:48.433 --> 02:31:51.396]  And listen, the crisis is now.
[02:31:51.456 --> 02:31:52.977]  The poison in your water is there.
[02:31:53.938 --> 02:31:55.540]  And your family deserves clean water.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:57.842]  And these are the best gravity filters out there.
[02:31:57.982 --> 02:32:00.404]  And you buy Chinese knockoffs for $100 more.
[02:32:00.925 --> 02:32:02.166]  This is made in America.
[02:32:02.186 --> 02:32:02.626]  You get these for $195, $250.
[02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:06.930]  You know, the different configurations.
[02:32:07.090 --> 02:32:10.173]  And a cheap knockoff is $300 at the local camping store.
[02:32:10.968 --> 02:32:12.910]  And you can go see Burke.
[02:32:12.970 --> 02:32:14.131]  He's there for $300, $350.
[02:32:14.451 --> 02:32:18.735]  So you're getting what distributors who buy hundreds are getting them for.
[02:32:19.355 --> 02:32:21.737]  They do that because they believe in the program.
[02:32:21.777 --> 02:32:22.538]  They're patriots.
[02:32:22.838 --> 02:32:24.700]  They are against the New World Order.
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:27.742]  Jim Shepard is a great Christian man, the owner.
[02:32:28.503 --> 02:32:31.946]  And with the Iran situation coming up, when is this a better time?
[02:32:31.986 --> 02:32:33.187]  And when is there a better time?
[02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:39.363]  With Israel saying they may attack him any minute, and Bush saying they're going to back him up, and Iran saying we're going to destroy you.
[02:32:39.804 --> 02:32:42.325]  I mean, look, scaring you gets you to buy filters.
[02:32:42.385 --> 02:32:42.865]  Fine.
[02:32:43.446 --> 02:32:44.847]  I'm telling you, that's not even a threat.
[02:32:44.907 --> 02:32:47.048]  The threat is what is already in your water.
[02:32:47.488 --> 02:32:48.409]  I drink filtered water.
[02:32:48.589 --> 02:32:49.449]  I use their systems.
[02:32:49.489 --> 02:32:50.790]  I bought it for friends and family.
[02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.951]  We use it.
[02:32:52.291 --> 02:32:53.011]  You need to have it.
[02:32:53.312 --> 02:32:54.652]  Debbie's going to spend a few minutes with us.
[02:32:54.672 --> 02:32:55.813]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:56.273 --> 02:32:56.914]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:32:57.014 --> 02:32:58.835]  Thank you so much for having me.
[02:32:59.295 --> 02:32:59.555]  You bet.
[02:32:59.575 --> 02:33:02.256]  I heard your phones have been ringing off the hook the last few weeks.
[02:33:02.276 --> 02:33:02.677]  That's good.
[02:33:02.697 --> 02:33:04.477]  That means people are concerned and are moving.
[02:33:05.038 --> 02:33:05.658]  I think so.
[02:33:05.698 --> 02:33:07.399]  I think people are finally realizing.
[02:33:07.439 --> 02:33:15.603]  I have call after call from your listeners who say, you know, I've been thinking about it for three years and I finally decided it's time to get a Berkey.
[02:33:16.283 --> 02:33:24.587]  And, you know, if they'd have bought it three years ago, they'd have quit buying bottled water a long time ago and probably would have saved thousands of dollars in their grocery list.
[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:30.824]  You know, for those people that are sitting around thinking, you know, I really ought to get a Berkey, but I can't afford it.
[02:33:31.285 --> 02:33:34.488]  You really can't afford not to get one if you're buying bottled water.
[02:33:34.508 --> 02:33:35.829]  Well, you've done the calculation.
[02:33:35.869 --> 02:33:37.370]  A small bottle of water is a dollar.
[02:33:37.410 --> 02:33:39.852]  A good size one is like two bucks, a dollar fifty.
[02:33:40.313 --> 02:33:43.696]  Let's say you drink, you're at work, you buy one or two of those a day.
[02:33:43.716 --> 02:33:48.560]  I mean, then in just a couple months you'll pay off the Berkey.
[02:33:48.980 --> 02:33:53.264]  That's right, and not only that, you know you're getting the very best possible
[02:33:53.769 --> 02:33:56.630]  Drinking water available in this day and time.
[02:33:56.670 --> 02:34:06.292]  You know, I mean, you're getting out the chemicals and the petroleum products that are in the water, all these things that are poisonous little by little every day.
[02:34:06.312 --> 02:34:09.613]  You know, you're drinking Berkey water, you're staying healthier.
[02:34:09.633 --> 02:34:17.175]  I know personally for me over the years since I've been doing Berkey water, I have quit getting strep throat like I used to get.
[02:34:17.315 --> 02:34:19.055]  I've quit getting the colds and
[02:34:19.834 --> 02:34:21.995]  Yeah, there's all sorts of bacteria.
[02:34:22.035 --> 02:34:30.897]  People need to go to the FDA's own website and look at what allowable levels of nickel and mercury and arsenic and all these poisons and then bacteria.
[02:34:30.917 --> 02:34:33.538]  See, the chlorine only kills the bacteria.
[02:34:33.558 --> 02:34:34.658]  You're still drinking them.
[02:34:34.978 --> 02:34:38.299]  You're still drinking little microscopic pieces of dead meat, basically.
[02:34:38.319 --> 02:34:39.420]  That's right.
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:40.100]  It sure is.
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:41.060]  And we take out
[02:34:41.556 --> 02:34:45.058]  The pathogenic bacteria to a non-detectable level.
[02:34:45.078 --> 02:34:46.739]  Well, take Los Angeles and many other cities.
[02:34:46.779 --> 02:34:47.780]  They have toilet to tap.
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:50.101]  They are drinking recycled sewer water.
[02:34:51.222 --> 02:34:52.003]  That's pretty thick.
[02:34:52.023 --> 02:34:53.584]  If you think about it.
[02:34:53.744 --> 02:34:58.106]  And then most of the bottled water is just semi-filtered for flavor toilet water.
[02:34:58.427 --> 02:34:58.927]  That's right.
[02:34:59.167 --> 02:35:00.128]  That's absolutely right.
[02:35:00.228 --> 02:35:06.652]  And you're getting, you know, the fluoride in lots of bottled water that they're not listing on the bottles.
[02:35:08.536 --> 02:35:11.697]  That's right, because the regular systems don't knock out the fluoride.
[02:35:11.717 --> 02:35:31.724]  In fact, even though murkies are the best thing out there under electron microscopes, no bacteria a week after you pour slime, long growth through it, some of the fluoride, I forget, looking at the statistics, what, like 87% of the fluoride is cut out by your filters, but you have to buy post filters on top of that that go on the spigot to just knock out the next level.
[02:35:31.764 --> 02:35:33.564]  I mean, fluoride is so hard to get out.
[02:35:33.984 --> 02:35:34.805]  It really is.
[02:35:36.124 --> 02:35:47.336]  We're one of the only filters out there that has the ability to take the fluoride out and we really want to encourage people to try and do the very best for their health.
[02:35:47.997 --> 02:35:53.984]  I've had so many customers who, you know, give me testimony after testimony how healthy they feel.
[02:35:54.557 --> 02:35:58.558]  How much more water they're drinking because they're actually seeing their water.
[02:35:58.578 --> 02:35:59.938]  Now does my memory serve me?
[02:36:00.418 --> 02:36:07.840]  Your regular filtration gets 80 plus percent out and then when you add the post filter only 99 percent?
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:11.441]  It takes out about 99 percent.
[02:36:11.861 --> 02:36:15.442]  The actual Black Berkey filters don't take any of the fluoride out Alex.
[02:36:16.141 --> 02:36:18.566]  It's just with the, you need to have the post filter.
[02:36:18.647 --> 02:36:20.591]  Okay, so is it the white ones that do that?
[02:36:20.611 --> 02:36:21.733]  I remember reading the literature.
[02:36:21.813 --> 02:36:23.316]  No, it was a long time ago.
[02:36:23.336 --> 02:36:25.461]  We had the very first set of filters.
[02:36:25.501 --> 02:36:27.405]  We tried doing a formulation.
[02:36:28.021 --> 02:36:32.783]  Where the filters did take out some of the fluoride with the black filters, but unfortunately... Oh, it was too slow!
[02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:33.283]  Too slow.
[02:36:33.303 --> 02:36:37.364]  It was so slow, and people would have had to replace the filters so quickly.
[02:36:37.384 --> 02:36:39.245]  It would have been very costly.
[02:36:39.265 --> 02:36:41.486]  So, people understand this, what we're talking about.
[02:36:41.506 --> 02:36:45.607]  Everybody talks about spring water being so good, or that you're down in these caves.
[02:36:45.647 --> 02:36:47.568]  That's because it's gone through the limestone.
[02:36:48.271 --> 02:36:48.451]  Correct.
[02:36:48.511 --> 02:36:59.239]  And this was invented in England, I don't know, 100-something, 200 years ago, and Queen Elizabeth gave them a big award for it, and then another Queen gave them an award for it, and then the American version is even better.
[02:36:59.659 --> 02:37:01.580]  I mean, it really does a great job, folks.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:02.741]  I hope you'll give Debbie a call.
[02:37:02.761 --> 02:37:03.121]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:37:03.141 --> 02:37:03.501]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:37:03.521 --> 02:37:04.482]  And you get a free gift.
[02:37:12.374 --> 02:37:14.679]  And when you get one of the larger Berkeys, you get two free gifts.
[02:37:14.699 --> 02:37:20.935]  You now even have the travel Berkey that's a little bit smaller for your campers or for at work.
[02:37:21.696 --> 02:37:26.260]  And just on InfoWars.com, on the shopping cart, tell them which free gift you want.
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:30.643]  Or you go to Berkeywater.com, get the exact same deals, exact same specials there.
[02:37:30.884 --> 02:37:34.106]  That's their direct website, Berkeywater.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:37:34.346 --> 02:37:37.229]  There's a banner on InfoWars as well, over to Berkeywater.com.
[02:37:37.529 --> 02:37:38.970]  Or call her right now, 1-888-803-4438.
[02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:44.615]  And if they're busy, leave her name and number and they'll call you right back.
[02:37:44.635 --> 02:37:44.675]  888-803-4438.
[02:37:44.715 --> 02:37:45.716]  Anything in closing, Debbie?
[02:37:49.316 --> 02:37:53.720]  Um, we're just real excited that we can sell the stainless steel travel brookies in California.
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:57.903]  So, for your California listeners, they've been holding out for stainless steel.
[02:37:57.943 --> 02:37:58.683]  Give me a call.
[02:37:59.364 --> 02:38:00.545]  Alright, thank you so much, Debbie.
[02:38:00.565 --> 02:38:01.645]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:01.706 --> 02:38:02.426]  Have a great day.
[02:38:02.446 --> 02:38:03.347]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:38:03.807 --> 02:38:04.628]  Give her a call.
[02:38:05.208 --> 02:38:06.649]  Okay, I believe in the sponsor.
[02:38:06.709 --> 02:38:07.390]  I know it works.
[02:38:07.650 --> 02:38:09.251]  I use it, and it's made in America.
[02:38:10.192 --> 02:38:11.813]  I know it's not made in India or China.
[02:38:12.153 --> 02:38:12.694]  Uh, we're evil.
[02:38:13.294 --> 02:38:13.635]  But, uh, 888-803-4438.
[02:38:13.655 --> 02:38:13.955]  Call them.
[02:38:18.423 --> 02:38:19.964]  Take control of your life, it's so important.
[02:38:19.984 --> 02:38:22.145]  Alright, let's uh... Who's up first here, you said?
[02:38:27.289 --> 02:38:29.110]  Stephen Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:30.371]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:30.991 --> 02:38:33.352]  Listen to you every day and really enjoy your show.
[02:38:33.372 --> 02:38:36.514]  Wanted to congratulate you on what you're doing.
[02:38:36.654 --> 02:38:39.536]  It's gotten me started and a number of other people that I know.
[02:38:39.556 --> 02:38:45.460]  I particularly wanted to congratulate you on yesterday's show with Charlie Sheen.
[02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:46.821]  I thought it was
[02:38:47.694 --> 02:38:53.425]  Extremely well considered and the comments that he made were very well taken all the way around.
[02:38:53.465 --> 02:38:57.793]  I think the liberty added to it will probably
[02:38:59.355 --> 02:39:02.316]  Help bring in a lot of other people that wouldn't otherwise pay attention.
[02:39:02.676 --> 02:39:03.517]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:03.577 --> 02:39:15.401]  I mean, we've had all these other prominent scientists and professors and former Bush administration officials and Reagan officials saying the same thing, and then Charlie Sheen wants to come on and boldly stand up and take a lot of risk.
[02:39:15.441 --> 02:39:16.582]  I mean, he can only be commended.
[02:39:16.642 --> 02:39:19.062]  I mean, oh, he had trouble earlier in his life.
[02:39:19.082 --> 02:39:19.783]  Well, so who didn't?
[02:39:19.863 --> 02:39:20.643]  You know, so what?
[02:39:21.023 --> 02:39:21.683]  He doesn't now.
[02:39:22.424 --> 02:39:22.884]  Exactly.
[02:39:22.944 --> 02:39:28.446]  And in light of that, there's two things in the American Statesman today that I thought you might be interested in.
[02:39:29.170 --> 02:39:37.235]  In the nation section on the back page one, there's a little paragraph entitled, uh, agent, a warrant of terrorist.
[02:39:38.196 --> 02:39:57.528]  It mentions an FBI agent who interrogated, uh, Mosawi before, uh, September the 11th, and it warned his supervisors more than 70 times that Mosawi was a terrorist, uh, and was, uh, his name is Harold Samet, and told jurors that, uh,
[02:39:58.283 --> 02:40:05.925]  At his death penalty trial yesterday that his efforts to secure a warrant to search his belongings were frustrated at every turn.
[02:40:05.945 --> 02:40:12.947]  Yeah, I actually have that article here in the stack and while you're talking, I'm trying to find it.
[02:40:13.148 --> 02:40:13.628]  Keep going.
[02:40:14.328 --> 02:40:19.489]  He accused the FBI officials, his superiors, of criminal negligence.
[02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:27.652]  So, obviously, there was extreme incompetence, if not collusion at the top, to
[02:40:28.869 --> 02:40:32.293]  Yeah, read me that headline.
[02:40:32.313 --> 02:40:33.794]  I want to see if it's the same story I've got.
[02:40:34.775 --> 02:40:44.387]  Yeah, I've got a headline here somewhere that I can't find for some reason, where it's, I think the headline's like, uh,
[02:40:50.142 --> 02:40:51.364]  I'll try to find it here in a minute.
[02:40:52.184 --> 02:41:04.535]  Basically, Zacharias Michelli, in any op the government's going to carry out, they've got to go out and provocateur Apache, who their people can meet with, and then talk into shooting their mouths off at the local bar.
[02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:17.257]  And then they can trot out the Patsy, like Marinus van der Lubbe, who they charged with the Reichstag fire, and they cut his head off over it.
[02:41:17.757 --> 02:41:18.558]  That's what Hitler did.
[02:41:19.598 --> 02:41:25.361]  So they always, you know, and then Zacharias Mishalis tried to call witnesses showing that he was a Patsy.
[02:41:25.401 --> 02:41:27.803]  They were trying to get him to talk about doing stuff that he didn't.
[02:41:28.463 --> 02:41:28.623]  Right.
[02:41:28.643 --> 02:41:30.665]  But in this case, they've got an FBI agent stating that he
[02:41:48.243 --> 02:41:55.588]  Well, I mean, we've interviewed the lawyer for FBI agent Robert Wright.
[02:41:56.008 --> 02:41:58.750]  Sterling record, moving up to the ranks quickly.
[02:41:59.151 --> 02:42:01.432]  He specifically knew all about what was about to happen.
[02:42:02.273 --> 02:42:04.815]  And he was told, you'll be arrested if you stop him.
[02:42:05.435 --> 02:42:09.658]  And then after the attacks, he was told, if you talk about it, you'll be arrested under national security.
[02:42:10.251 --> 02:42:16.655]  And then so he got up on the National Press Club and said, all I can tell you, and he broke down in tears, is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:42:17.175 --> 02:42:18.436]  And he broke down crying.
[02:42:18.836 --> 02:42:22.779]  He said, here's the letter, I'll be arrested under national security, oh my god, oh my god.
[02:42:23.019 --> 02:42:26.201]  I think we have that clip somewhere on the computer, we haven't played it in years, maybe they don't have it now.
[02:42:26.581 --> 02:42:29.943]  But it's in, what is it, it's in Masters of Terror.
[02:42:30.723 --> 02:42:36.287]  But the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens, gee, what could he be trying to tell us?
[02:42:37.043 --> 02:42:38.905]  Of course, he just said that because it's been in the news.
[02:42:39.185 --> 02:42:40.366]  But see, people just can't get that.
[02:42:40.446 --> 02:42:42.968]  Oh, I guess... And by the way, he was a Republican.
[02:42:42.988 --> 02:42:44.230]  It's not like it's some Bush hater.
[02:42:44.530 --> 02:42:48.253]  You know, you get these mindless Bush followers that just think it's all liberal lies.
[02:42:48.914 --> 02:42:50.836]  Now, the Democrats are helping cover this up, too.
[02:42:50.896 --> 02:42:51.516]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:52.617 --> 02:42:54.259]  And here's an example of this.
[02:42:55.460 --> 02:43:01.805]  The Charlie Sheen story got tens... Well, that's not true.
[02:43:01.865 --> 02:43:02.266]  I was told
[02:43:03.152 --> 02:43:08.194]  Eight million page views yesterday on the two sites together in the aggregate.
[02:43:08.834 --> 02:43:20.859]  And I would imagine now, that's how my brain works, that since I checked that this morning, a couple more million have come in, but it's slowed down to, what they say, a few hundred thousand for each website that has it posted every hour or so.
[02:43:20.879 --> 02:43:22.840]  I guess it's getting up close to nine million or something.
[02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:23.541]  But again, I haven't checked.
[02:43:23.841 --> 02:43:26.882]  Eight million page views and
[02:43:28.075 --> 02:43:30.758]  And of course, most of that is because Drudge linked to it for four hours.
[02:43:30.818 --> 02:43:32.059]  Most of that came in in four hours.
[02:43:32.099 --> 02:43:36.102]  And that site just gets... I forget, what is it, like 20 million visitors a day?
[02:43:36.142 --> 02:43:37.944]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[02:43:38.805 --> 02:43:40.706]  It's ridiculous how much that site gets.
[02:43:41.307 --> 02:43:43.689]  Because there's not many stories on it, and it gets such huge traffic.
[02:43:44.490 --> 02:43:55.139]  And so if your story's up there, and like all these other newshounds, and all these other people that are too lazy to check their inboxes, that's where the really good news is, that listeners send you from all over, they, you know, they go up to Drudge every day.
[02:43:56.090 --> 02:44:00.293]  And he posts it up there and then jerks it up for four hours and then doesn't put it in his archive.
[02:44:00.333 --> 02:44:03.135]  He never, he never does that.
[02:44:03.935 --> 02:44:09.019]  So, email Drudge and say, Drudge, why didn't you post that story?
[02:44:09.119 --> 02:44:10.139]  Why aren't you covering it?
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:11.941]  Why aren't you reporting on it?
[02:44:12.001 --> 02:44:13.081]  Call the Associated Press.
[02:44:13.462 --> 02:44:16.604]  I talked to AP reporters who were, yeah, this is big, we're going to get this out.
[02:44:16.624 --> 02:44:19.466]  And you call them back, oh, we're not running it now.
[02:44:19.546 --> 02:44:21.427]  Well, just upstairs said no.
[02:44:22.423 --> 02:44:24.325]  Now you call a Hollywood reporter, hey did you get that?
[02:44:24.365 --> 02:44:25.546]  Yeah, I got it yesterday afternoon.
[02:44:25.566 --> 02:44:26.446]  Do you think it's a big story?
[02:44:26.767 --> 02:44:27.607]  Yeah, it's big.
[02:44:28.168 --> 02:44:28.908]  Well, what's going to happen?
[02:44:28.928 --> 02:44:30.310]  I pass it on, they're not going to run it.
[02:44:31.170 --> 02:44:31.851]  And you call another.
[02:44:31.871 --> 02:44:42.159]  Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot,
[02:44:49.108 --> 02:44:49.988]  I mean, they're shocked, too.
[02:44:50.028 --> 02:45:07.454]  I mean, imagine, if Charlie Sheen would have fallen off of a bicycle, or had a motorcycle wreck, or if Charlie Sheen would have gotten in an argument with his wife in front of people at a coffee shop, if Charlie Sheen would have been seen smoking marijuana, it would be top news on CNN, ABC, Fox, endlessly.
[02:45:07.855 --> 02:45:14.837]  He goes on the air, and cogently talks about having a real investigation, and talks about how, concerning the war, that Bush is arrogant,
[02:45:16.303 --> 02:45:22.408]  And then meanwhile, Carlos Santana, which is nothing on the scale of a Charlie Sheen, if we're being big.
[02:45:22.428 --> 02:45:26.451]  I mean, he's been an A-list actor for 20 years.
[02:45:27.511 --> 02:45:34.637]  He's been in over 65 major films, got two coming out this year, one of the number one TV shows in the country, on for about three years, signed on for a new season.
[02:45:37.038 --> 02:45:38.860]  And it's just, yes, it's a big story.
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:39.941]  No, we're not running it.
[02:45:40.481 --> 02:45:44.444]  And then I call and I talk to Jeff Williams at the AP in L.A.
[02:45:45.390 --> 02:45:49.093]  I mean, he just sounded like a gritty individual.
[02:45:49.974 --> 02:45:51.796]  And he just, no, we're not running it.
[02:45:52.797 --> 02:45:54.398]  No, we're not running anything.
[02:45:54.858 --> 02:45:57.020]  We're not running anything about Charlie Sheen.
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:45:58.742]  I know Charlie Sheen.
[02:45:58.762 --> 02:46:00.623]  I go, is it newsworthy?
[02:46:00.683 --> 02:46:04.607]  Why did your very office run the Santana piece?
[02:46:04.667 --> 02:46:07.109]  I go, and the guy just got mad.
[02:46:08.152 --> 02:46:09.553]  And then I said, you know it's newsworthy.
[02:46:09.593 --> 02:46:10.814]  Tell me it isn't newsworthy.
[02:46:11.095 --> 02:46:15.338]  When Charlie Sheen says these things, and then it wouldn't run if it didn't have 9-11 stuff in it.
[02:46:15.999 --> 02:46:19.662]  And he's like, I'm not gonna let you bait me.
[02:46:19.682 --> 02:46:20.402]  He just yelled it.
[02:46:20.462 --> 02:46:21.904]  I'm not gonna let you bait me!
[02:46:22.444 --> 02:46:23.705]  Slam the phone down!
[02:46:26.708 --> 02:46:29.350]  And then you talk to others, and they're like, yeah, we think it ought to run, yeah?
[02:46:30.191 --> 02:46:31.352]  But it's not going to.
[02:46:33.033 --> 02:46:34.174]  See, drugs thought it was big.
[02:46:34.214 --> 02:46:36.396]  Put it up, and then boom, jerked it.
[02:46:38.624 --> 02:46:39.324]  Email Drudge.
[02:46:39.504 --> 02:46:39.844]  Ask him.
[02:46:40.885 --> 02:46:41.205]  Ask him.
[02:46:42.265 --> 02:46:43.185]  Ask him what's going on.
[02:46:43.305 --> 02:46:44.426]  Ask him why it's not up.
[02:46:46.286 --> 02:46:47.647]  Call the AP in your town.
[02:46:47.747 --> 02:46:48.107]  Call them.
[02:46:49.147 --> 02:46:57.230]  If you're in a good-sized city, I mean, Austin's only, you know, a million metro, 800,000 in the town, and then they've got an Associated Press, and be nice to them.
[02:46:57.250 --> 02:46:58.590]  You know, ask them, are you going to run it?
[02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:59.750]  You know, this is a big story.
[02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:01.751]  And they go, well, no, no, we're not going to.
[02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:03.051]  Or, no, no, it's not a big story.
[02:47:03.331 --> 02:47:05.312]  Go, well, why is all this other stuff big?
[02:47:06.832 --> 02:47:13.174]  Why if somebody says they think Bush is an idiot, it's top news, because there's not substance behind it.
[02:47:13.214 --> 02:47:17.535]  They can't report that... I talked to Charlie this morning, what was his statement?
[02:47:17.555 --> 02:47:23.736]  He just reiterated the quote of, you know, if there's something wrong with Building 7's story, then there's something wrong with the whole thing.
[02:47:24.736 --> 02:47:26.017]  His exact quote's on the website.
[02:47:28.837 --> 02:47:31.438]  By the way, there's a typo in our story.
[02:47:31.718 --> 02:47:33.038]  It was 1,100 feet, not 120 feet.
[02:47:35.683 --> 02:47:38.204]  That the fire went down the elevator shafts and we screwed that up.
[02:47:38.284 --> 02:47:39.505]  Charlie pointed that out to me this morning.
[02:47:39.525 --> 02:47:40.165]  He's a little sharp.
[02:47:41.485 --> 02:47:43.826]  And so I forgot to tell Ryan Slickhize that.
[02:47:43.866 --> 02:47:45.347]  I forgot to tell Paul Joseph Watson that.
[02:47:45.387 --> 02:47:47.468]  You guys need to change that immediately.
[02:47:49.209 --> 02:47:54.531]  Because it has been picked up by a lot of big alternative media and some medium-sized town newspapers have picked it up.
[02:47:54.571 --> 02:47:58.072]  But again, that's not the controlled media.
[02:47:58.112 --> 02:48:00.673]  This is an exercise in that.
[02:48:01.334 --> 02:48:04.635]  It's an exercise in documenting the control.
[02:48:06.559 --> 02:48:19.191]  It's a demonstration, better than it's an exercise, in showing how they'll report on somebody if they're out with a call girl ten years ago and still talk about it every day.
[02:48:19.932 --> 02:48:21.273]  There's articles out about that today.
[02:48:23.335 --> 02:48:25.858]  And, you know, stuff about Charity Sheen got
[02:48:26.602 --> 02:48:29.105]  Heather Locklear to talk to his wife for him.
[02:48:29.405 --> 02:48:31.727]  Oh, how bad of him!
[02:48:32.888 --> 02:48:36.432]  Meanwhile, he's putting it all on the line to say this because he said it so cogently.
[02:48:37.172 --> 02:48:39.935]  It doesn't fit the caricature they want to put on him.
[02:48:40.596 --> 02:48:41.136]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:49.353]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.593 --> 02:48:51.175]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.515 --> 02:48:56.198]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.539 --> 02:49:03.304]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.604 --> 02:49:05.586]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:05.787 --> 02:49:08.610]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.730 --> 02:49:13.375]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.595 --> 02:49:17.980]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:21.644]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:25.445]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:25.685 --> 02:49:28.126]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.286 --> 02:49:31.867]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:49:31.887 --> 02:49:32.267]  1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:45.515 --> 02:49:53.018]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:53.298 --> 02:50:04.203]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:05.705 --> 02:50:09.869]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:10.210 --> 02:50:20.662]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.962 --> 02:50:21.463]  That's right!
[02:50:21.643 --> 02:50:28.768]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:29.048 --> 02:50:33.171]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:50:33.331 --> 02:50:37.354]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.474 --> 02:50:38.015]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:47.384 --> 02:50:47.724]  I think so.
[02:51:02.609 --> 02:51:03.269]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.139 --> 02:51:35.221]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.382 --> 02:51:41.346]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.509 --> 02:51:47.711]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:48.271 --> 02:51:51.153]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:53.075 --> 02:51:54.016]  Look at this news.
[02:51:54.176 --> 02:51:56.978]  Iraqi diplomat gave US pre-war WMD details.
[02:51:58.627 --> 02:52:01.890]  Saddam's foreign minister told the CIA the truth, so why didn't the agency listen?
[02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:06.093]  He was their paid-off agent, and he said he doesn't have any biological, any chemical, nothing.
[02:52:06.494 --> 02:52:09.276]  And now that's NBC News.
[02:52:09.336 --> 02:52:10.197]  Too little, too late.
[02:52:11.097 --> 02:52:17.883]  Kissinger, quote, America's global strategy benefits from the Indian participation in building a new world order.
[02:52:18.824 --> 02:52:20.105]  So let's give them more nukes.
[02:52:20.765 --> 02:52:23.768]  That's a good thing, but let's attack Iran, who can't have them for 10 years.
[02:52:25.408 --> 02:52:42.525]  Continuing, Japan's rich by organs from executed Chinese, London Independent, and our own State Department says on its website, it isn't true, China doesn't sell organs, when the Chinese government advertises in major medical magazines and publications, saying that they have them, and advertising it.
[02:52:42.545 --> 02:52:45.628]  That's the level of denial our government tries to give us.
[02:52:46.491 --> 02:52:57.300]  And it says, hundreds of well-off Japanese other nationals are turning to China's burgeoning human organ transplant industry, paying tens of thousands of pounds for livers and kidneys, which in some cases have been harvested from executed prisoners and sold to hospitals.
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:01.503]  And I've heard neocons the last few years promoting that idea here.
[02:53:02.244 --> 02:53:03.525]  Killing people and taking their organs.
[02:53:04.005 --> 02:53:07.308]  Which then puts an incentive in there to kill by a corrupt government.
[02:53:07.688 --> 02:53:09.970]  Chinese internet dissident gets a 10-year sentence.
[02:53:11.235 --> 02:53:13.957]  And that was just for having a little human rights internet website.
[02:53:14.177 --> 02:53:15.218]  Criticizing what they do.
[02:53:15.258 --> 02:53:15.758]  Here's another one.
[02:53:16.398 --> 02:53:17.239]  AAP.
[02:53:17.579 --> 02:53:19.540]  China bans weird baby names.
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:22.522]  See, that's the incredible freedom of the country we're giving all our industry to.
[02:53:23.002 --> 02:53:25.103]  Already only allowing to have one child.
[02:53:25.143 --> 02:53:28.405]  Chinese parents may now face restrictions on what name they can give their baby.
[02:53:28.445 --> 02:53:31.107]  China is planning to introduce new regulations on name registration.
[02:53:33.226 --> 02:53:34.027]  Registration.
[02:53:34.087 --> 02:53:40.831]  Can't talk now because the government's computer database is unable to handle rare Chinese characters state media reported today.
[02:53:40.891 --> 02:53:42.792]  Well, that sounds reasonable.
[02:53:43.613 --> 02:53:44.914]  Can't name your child now.
[02:53:45.254 --> 02:53:46.334]  Probably have that here soon.
[02:53:46.354 --> 02:53:48.516]  Uh, death squads on the prowl.
[02:53:48.596 --> 02:53:50.037]  Iraq convulsed by fear.
[02:53:50.057 --> 02:53:52.378]  Admitted death squads marching around killing everyone.
[02:53:52.859 --> 02:53:56.161]  Paramedic who worked on WTC morgue dies of respiratory illness, AP.
[02:53:57.817 --> 02:54:01.699]  And, uh, in my film I talk about, uh, what, 12 dogs dying?
[02:54:01.739 --> 02:54:03.560]  Now it's been like 20-something.
[02:54:03.600 --> 02:54:07.543]  Almost all of them have died from lung cancer or nasal cancer.
[02:54:08.003 --> 02:54:09.904]  The same thing's happening with firefighters and police.
[02:54:09.944 --> 02:54:18.489]  A 41-year-old paramedic who worked at the morgue for months after September 11th, 2001, in an attack at the World Trade Center, was buried Monday after dying of an asbestos-related cancer.
[02:54:18.509 --> 02:54:24.032]  And, of course, the building was asbestos, and they weren't worried about giving the cops breathers for three days, and the firemen
[02:54:24.841 --> 02:54:26.904]  But you're with Al-Qaeda if you say that.
[02:54:26.945 --> 02:54:28.767]  You're just trying to undermine the President.
[02:54:29.128 --> 02:54:33.755]  And the President blocked $90 million payout by the EPA to help the firemen and police.
[02:54:34.276 --> 02:54:35.258]  That's your government.
[02:54:36.414 --> 02:54:37.635]  A bunch of sick scum.
[02:54:37.975 --> 02:54:38.956]  Pat Tillman's dad.
[02:54:38.996 --> 02:54:40.016]  What happened to my son?
[02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:43.038]  It has all been a lie after a lie after a lie after a lie.
[02:54:43.078 --> 02:54:43.739]  New York Times.
[02:54:44.279 --> 02:54:47.561]  And you ought to go read this article just how at every level they lied from the start.
[02:54:48.001 --> 02:54:49.082]  And told him to shut up.
[02:54:49.142 --> 02:54:50.283]  And lied and lied and lied.
[02:54:50.303 --> 02:54:51.323]  They are liars.
[02:54:51.524 --> 02:54:52.804]  That's all they do is lie.
[02:54:53.085 --> 02:54:54.425]  I'm sorry to all the callers that are holding.
[02:54:54.485 --> 02:54:54.946]  I'm out of time.
[02:54:54.966 --> 02:54:55.926]  Won't have time to take your calls.
[02:54:55.946 --> 02:54:56.847]  But call me back tomorrow.
[02:54:57.387 --> 02:54:58.388]  And I'll be able to take your calls.
[02:54:58.708 --> 02:54:59.849]  Dutch Coffee Shop.
[02:55:00.504 --> 02:55:06.769]  Introduce fingerprint ID to make sure when you're buying things over-the-counter that are only for adults.
[02:55:06.809 --> 02:55:07.890]  You've got a thumb scan.
[02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:15.656]  That's coming here too, but it'll be part of the national ID card, which is going to have a graduated sales tax, and so we'll have to make sure you're not cheating on your bracket.
[02:55:16.196 --> 02:55:30.699]  Identity cards, a present to terrorists and criminals, spy heroine says, the side of the Scotsman, a national identity card scheme will be a present to terrorists, criminal gangs and foreign spies, one of Britain's most respected former intelligence agents has told ministers.
[02:55:31.759 --> 02:55:35.300]  And top security experts said, as the others have, it will actually make things worse.
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:38.381]  That's the plan, the globalists are the spies and crooks.
[02:55:39.061 --> 02:55:40.061]  The warning from
[02:55:41.298 --> 02:55:50.780]  Daphne Park, who served 30 years as Senior Controller for MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, came as a preliminary power struggle over the Identity Cards Bill dragged on.
[02:55:51.421 --> 02:55:53.361]  House of Lords has rejected it for the fourth time.
[02:55:53.401 --> 02:55:54.701]  Tony Blair continues to pass it.
[02:55:55.162 --> 02:55:57.002]  Eighty-plus percent of the country is against it.
[02:55:57.302 --> 02:55:59.063]  And here's that other article I just mentioned.
[02:55:59.643 --> 02:56:02.904]  Lords defeats ID Card Bill for the fourth time, one that intended.
[02:56:03.604 --> 02:56:04.544]  BBC covers
[02:56:06.078 --> 02:56:08.279]  The concerns over military and police merging.
[02:56:08.939 --> 02:56:11.140]  White House pushes more schools for drug testing.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:13.081]  Testing for their product.
[02:56:13.521 --> 02:56:14.681]  Testing for product placement.
[02:56:15.762 --> 02:56:16.462]  I'm out of time.
