[00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:04.561]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.321]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.102]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:09.562]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:11.222]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.543]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:20.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.420]  Well, gold right now is over $704 an ounce.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:48.563]  Oil prices are climbing back up steadily again after Condoleezza Rice a few days ago took the President of Iran's letter, the first from an Iranian head of state, calling the President, Your Excellency and Sir.
[00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:51.864]  And they just took it and basically wadded it up and laughed at him.
[00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:55.405]  Yes, that's the great diplomacy.
[00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:56.705]  You see, they want a war.
[00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:59.026]  Now oil prices are exploding yet again.
[00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:04.220]  And the globalists know that this helps the crisis widen or out of chaos.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.920]  That's what they want.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.701]  That's what they're doing.
[00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.462]  I want to get some into the President of Iran's letter.
[00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:15.444]  It's been out for a few days, but I just had a chance to read the entire 18 pages last night.
[00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:20.446]  He talks about 9-11, questioning the official story, though vaguely.
[00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:24.328]  And he gets into a lot of the crimes committed against the Iranians and a lot more.
[00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:24.948]  We'll get into that.
[00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:30.568]  And no, I'm not for the Iranians, but I'm sure not for the bankers that run this country either.
[00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:35.210]  Governments themselves throughout history are corrupt and out of control and wicked.
[00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:46.474]  And I think that goes for the Iranian government as well, but compared to the New World Order, Iran is run by a lower demon and America is truly run by Beelzebub in chief.
[00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:51.056]  An admitted practicing Satanist, Bush is.
[00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:54.237]  A servant of the dark side, he is.
[00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:56.149]  No debating it.
[00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.029]  He is.
[00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:01.192]  And we'll get into the Minutemen.
[00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:04.715]  In fact, we'll do this when we get back from break.
[00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.797]  It's the most outrageous thing we've seen yet.
[00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.979]  U.S.
[00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.641]  tipping Mexico to Minutemen patrols.
[00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:17.124]  But first, let's go ahead and roll Inside Job and we'll come back after the break and get right into the news.
[00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:18.325]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:18.745]  Stay with us.
[00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.617]  They came and took it all away.
[00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.543]  The place is where you used to play.
[00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:43.365]  It was an inside joke, by the well-connected.
[00:02:46.107 --> 00:02:54.193]  You're a sinner's protest, so merrily rejected.
[00:02:54.834 --> 00:03:03.420]  It was an inside joke, like it always is.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.762]  Chalk it up to a feeling that's as usual.
[00:03:11.642 --> 00:03:29.007]  While you are dreaming, this little island disappears.
[00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:35.629]  While you are looking the other way,
[00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:41.110]  They'll take your right to own your own ideas.
[00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.876]  And it's an inside job, favor selection.
[00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:54.282]  Your trusted servants have left you a prediction.
[00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:59.788]  With an inside job, like it always is.
[00:04:04.214 --> 00:04:07.898]  I don't think so.
[00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:30.811]  I know.
[00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:01.712]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.974]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.094 --> 00:05:08.997]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:13.319]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.402]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:19.403]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:22.865]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:23.986]  The medical bills!
[00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:27.606]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:30.787]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:33.848]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:40.431]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:44.774]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:45.174 --> 00:05:46.535]  Order your video today.
[00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:47.936]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:50.278]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:50.298 --> 00:05:51.739]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:05.631]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:10.054]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:10.915]  We listened.
[00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:16.200]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.960]  We listened.
[00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:20.383]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:21.324]  We listened.
[00:06:21.784 --> 00:06:25.845]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:26.725]  We listened.
[00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:32.307]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:32.707 --> 00:06:34.067]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:34.447 --> 00:06:41.829]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.650]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling

[00:06:51.326 --> 00:06:52.368]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:08:09.052 --> 00:08:09.892]  You want answers?
[00:08:09.912 --> 00:08:11.473]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:16.155]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:20.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.577 --> 00:08:26.399]  It is Wednesday, the 10th day of May 2006.
[00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:28.419]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.660]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:30.672 --> 00:08:35.658]  New draconian anti-gun legislation moving through at the federal level.
[00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:44.970]  Aaron Zellman of Jews the Preservation of Firearms ownership will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour or roughly an hour and 20 minutes from now.
[00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:53.487]  Then we have Dar Jamal who's been on with us several times with new information concerning what's really going on in Iraq.
[00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.710]  He'll be joining us today in the third hour.
[00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.533]  We'll have wide open phones for all three hours.
[00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:01.695]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:05.559]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:18.970]  Well, Hillary Clinton and Rupert Murdoch told the Financial Times of London after their big story yesterday about how the two are inseparable and Murdoch's going to raise money for her.
[00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.554]  They came out with their spin, and we'll be getting into that.
[00:09:23.634 --> 00:09:26.416]  Of course, we're evil liberals here because we're against Hillary.
[00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:29.558]  Now, to be a conservative, you must be pro-Hillary.
[00:09:29.638 --> 00:09:30.239]  Just watch.
[00:09:31.073 --> 00:09:36.884]  Neocons love the anti-gun, pro-world government Tony Blair, and they're really going to love Hillary.
[00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.630]  But right now, the treason continues.
[00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:41.492]  We know that
[00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:51.073]  Our porous border has been fostered, the porousness of it has been fostered by the White House, no matter what administration we've seen the last 30 years.
[00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:56.175]  It has been fostered and pushed by the Mexican government for over 60 years.
[00:09:56.636 --> 00:10:01.918]  They teach every grade school student in Mexico that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:16.953]  And that every problem in Mexico is caused by the evil Americans and our government just loves it because it's part of the public CFR plan that even Lou Dobbs has covered to break up the sovereignty of America for an American Union similar to the European Union.
[00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:25.522]  And we know that everywhere the Minutemen show up, in Texas, in Arizona, and in Southern California,
[00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:29.368]  That they're being followed by Feds.
[00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:41.058]  And the Feds, we already had gotten reports of this, were radioing the exact locations in real time and even using military spy aircraft to track the Minutemen.
[00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.319]  We've covered this in the past.
[00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:48.144]  Now it's in the Associated Press and several other major publications.
[00:10:50.046 --> 00:10:52.928]  The Mexican government is bragging about this.
[00:10:55.123 --> 00:11:11.478]  President Bush has had the federal government pay states nationwide from Texas to Florida to South Carolina to Virginia to Arizona just all over the place to have these federally written training manuals where they say property rights activist
[00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:15.392]  Gun owners, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:11:15.432 --> 00:11:16.252]  Constitution.
[00:11:16.613 --> 00:11:18.295]  These are exact quotes, by the way.
[00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:23.060]  Homeschoolers, those that believe in sovereignty of the states.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.641]  Those that believe in a U.N.
[00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:25.562]  conspiracy.
[00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:30.227]  That we are terrorists and need to be watched.
[00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:34.311]  So, so, tattle on everyone, spy on everyone.
[00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:37.933]  If you have a road almanac in your car, it's a sure sign of being a terrorist.
[00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:40.495]  If you're wearing blue jeans, Levi's, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:42.576]  If you have a cell phone, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:42.637 --> 00:11:44.838]  If you're traveling with women and children, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:45.098 --> 00:11:47.340]  If you're polite and kindly to police, you're a terrorist.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.241]  I mean, these are the official manuals.
[00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:53.984]  And then Bush comes out last year and says, the minute men are dangerous vigilantes,
[00:11:54.702 --> 00:12:00.532]  And he sicks the Justice Department on them, and all over the country they'll charge border watch groups for the most petty of things.
[00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:08.745]  It doesn't matter if a French TV news crews there covering the Minutemen, and that was even a pre-Minutemen group, Ranch Rescue,
[00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:15.322]  Giving blankets and water to two, what was it, Venezuelans that had come across the border.
[00:12:15.342 --> 00:12:16.742]  No, it was Nicaraguans.
[00:12:17.343 --> 00:12:21.205]  And then they run off and claim that they were abused by the ranch rescue.
[00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:23.206]  It doesn't matter if there's videotape of the whole thing.
[00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:25.787]  And then they end up losing their ranches and going to jail.
[00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.388]  So, spy on each other inside America.
[00:12:29.488 --> 00:12:30.568]  Spy on your neighbors.
[00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:32.008]  Report everyone.
[00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:36.849]  Coast to coast, right here in Austin, Texas, they give out little discount credit cards.
[00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.710]  It gives them like freebies at the school cafeteria.
[00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:46.092]  And they get extra credits and get CD players and Walkmans and $200 PlayStation 2s.
[00:12:46.572 --> 00:12:49.492]  If they tattle on their parents, what's in the medicine cabinet?
[00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:56.014]  I have local TV ads in my film Road to Tyranny where it shows the Austin police advertising on TV.
[00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:00.044]  Report your parents, report your neighbors, report everyone!
[00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:01.713]  You're now enrolled in the program!
[00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:28.912]  That's all wonderful and good, of course it's completely un-American, but if you go down the border, even on your own property or someone else's property who's a volunteer, and you videotape, and you have radios, and you have cell phones, and you don't touch the illegals, you just call the police, you have the FBI and others, and the Border Patrol, not busy arresting the coyotes, the smugglers, the drug dealers, the human smugglers, the murderers that have killed over 800 just last year on the Texas-Mexican border,
[00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:39.456]  The State Department's stating last year in three separate emergency releases that it is more dangerous on the Texas-Mexico border than it is in the West Bank of Israel.
[00:13:41.117 --> 00:13:52.781]  All mainstream news, all admitted, machine gunnings, car bombings, total slaughter going on, cops being killed every month, sheriffs having Mexican troops come up and aim machine guns at them and taking drugs back that have been seized.
[00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:54.462]  We've had the sheriffs on, it's been in the news.
[00:13:54.782 --> 00:13:55.762]  You know the laundry list.
[00:13:56.362 --> 00:13:57.903]  All of this is going on!
[00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:02.292]  And we have this in front of us here today.
[00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:05.915]  First report about the Daily Bulletin and also the Associated Press.
[00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:06.976]  U.S.
[00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:09.958]  tipping Mexico to Minutemen patrols.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.222]  Top story up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:14:15.197 --> 00:14:19.562]  While Minutemen civilian patrols are keeping an eye out for illegal border crossers, the U.S.
[00:14:19.602 --> 00:14:24.427]  Border Patrol is keeping an eye out for the Minutemen and telling the Mexican government where they are.
[00:14:24.727 --> 00:14:26.209]  And we've talked to many of the Minutemen.
[00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:28.512]  We've talked to Al Garza, their national coordinator.
[00:14:28.832 --> 00:14:30.193]  He's been shot at three times.
[00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:35.379]  So, our government, and by the way, the Mexican troops and the Mexican mafia openly have a $200,000 bounty on Border Patrol's heads.
[00:14:39.418 --> 00:14:45.721]  And don't weasel around that psychologically, cops listening, because you worship the government no matter what it does, even as it flushes you down the toilet.
[00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.441]  That has been in the mainstream news.
[00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:51.463]  There is a $200,000 bounty on law enforcement on the border.
[00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:53.624]  Predominantly on the Border Patrol.
[00:14:53.984 --> 00:14:54.744]  So what do they do?
[00:14:55.284 --> 00:15:00.306]  Oh, let's give them the data so they can shoot at the minute men that are trying to support us.
[00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:01.947]  Because we've been ordered to.
[00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.168]  Why do you follow orders?
[00:15:05.103 --> 00:15:07.444]  Would you stick your mother in an oven if they told you to?
[00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:12.165]  According to three documents on the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations website, the U.S.
[00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:25.388]  Border Patrol is to notify the Mexican government as to the location of Minutemen and other civilian border patrol groups when they participate in apprehending illegal immigrants, and if and when violence is used against border crossers.
[00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:26.728]  So they add that little caveat.
[00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:27.948]  A U.S.
[00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:34.530]  Customs and Border Protection spokesman confirmed the notification process, describing it as a standard procedure meant to reassure
[00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:40.584]  Reassure the Mexican government that migrants' rights are being observed.
[00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:45.545]  What, their rights to engage in the reconquering of the Southwest?
[00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:46.045]  You mean that?
[00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:48.625]  The rights of your coyotes to feed on them?
[00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:55.147]  The rights of your troops to kill cops and citizens and torch houses and rob sheriffs at gunpoint?
[00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:56.287]  Guns to their heads?
[00:15:57.127 --> 00:16:03.088]  It's not a secret where the Minutemen volunteers are going to be, said Mario Martinez Monday.
[00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:05.554]  This simply makes two basic statements.
[00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:15.585]  That we will not allow any lawlessness of any type, and that if an alien is encountered by a Minuteman, or arrested by the Minuteman, then we will allow the government to interview the person.
[00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:21.631]  And that is the Mexican Foreign Relations Statement.
[00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:24.194]  So, they're the boss.
[00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:25.831]  They're the boss.
[00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:26.371]  There they are.
[00:16:27.232 --> 00:16:27.932]  They run things.
[00:16:28.432 --> 00:16:32.233]  They're a good corrupt government that our government's using to destroy America, so they're going to be given the red carpet.
[00:16:32.753 --> 00:16:43.136]  Minutemen members were not so sanguine about the arrangement, however, saying that reporting their location to Mexican officials nullifies their effectiveness along the border and could endanger their lives.
[00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:48.878]  Yeah, the Mexican troops have been caught with the flat-backed trucks just carrying thousands of illegals here and there.
[00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:49.618]  They just go around them.
[00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:57.995]  Now we know why it seems like Mexican officials know where we are all the time, said Chris Simcox, founder of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps.
[00:16:59.136 --> 00:17:03.719]  It's unbelievable that our own government agency is sending intelligence to another country.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.926]  They are sending intelligence to a nation where corruption runs rampant and that could be getting into the hands of criminal cartels.
[00:17:12.126 --> 00:17:12.666]  Could be?
[00:17:12.706 --> 00:17:13.567]  What do you mean?
[00:17:14.007 --> 00:17:17.110]  They just basically endanger the lives of the American people.
[00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:20.241]  Well, when Americans get killed or kidnapped, it's just back of the paper.
[00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:20.882]  Nobody cares.
[00:17:22.363 --> 00:17:24.125]  Officials of the Mexican Consulate in D.C.
[00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:25.166]  cannot be reached for comment.
[00:17:25.706 --> 00:17:37.597]  Martinez said reporting the location of immigrant apprehensions to consulate representatives in common practice if an illegal immigrant requests counsel or believes they have been mistreated.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.201]  Wow.
[00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:46.425]  Once the illegal alien is apprehended, they can request counsel, he said.
[00:17:46.505 --> 00:17:54.151]  We have to give the counsel the information about the apprehension, and that includes where they were apprehended, whether a Minuteman volunteer spotted them, or a citizen.
[00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:58.954]  And what they do is, and we've caught them, they've been told, they've been given lawyers, phone numbers, and how to do it.
[00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:07.880]  Even if a Minuteman doesn't touch them, they know the location, and they claim when the Border Patrol shows up, that they were assaulted, and they lie under oath, and the U.S.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.723]  attorneys and local state attorneys, they swoop in viciously.
[00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:14.385]  The government's playing hardball, folks.
[00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:17.007]  They've got to make sure that border stays open to break down this country.
[00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:29.356]  Martinez said Mexican officials' perception of the civilian groups is that they are vigilantes and believe the Border Patrol hopes to allay, well the President says it too, by entering into a cooperative agreement.
[00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:30.156]  Yes.
[00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:33.779]  Isn't that just special?
[00:18:36.397 --> 00:18:53.951]  One of the documents on the website, Actions of the Mexican Government in Relation to the Activities of Vigilante Groups, states that the Mexican Consulate Representatives stay in close contact with Border Patrol Chiefs to ensure the safety of the migrants trying to enter the U.S., those being detained, and the actions of all vigilantes along the border.
[00:18:54.532 --> 00:18:58.535]  The Mexican Council and Presidio also contacted the Chief of the Border Patrol
[00:18:59.344 --> 00:19:08.730]  uh... in the sector to solicit his cooperation in case they detect any activities of the vigilantes and who were told to immediately contact the consulate if there was according to the document.
[00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:27.681]  So, you got the Mexican troops running around dealing drugs, killing people, robbing Mexicans, shooting at sheriffs, killing sheriff's deputies, stealing from sheriffs, taking drugs back from sheriffs, and then they're all busy reporting back what the Minutemen are doing, but meanwhile telling the American citizens to tattle on anyone and everyone around you and training your children how to be brown shirt Nazis.
[00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.650]  So, just understand that.
[00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:39.076]  The document also describes a meeting between San Diego Border Patrol Chief Daryl Griffin and the Mexican terrorist.
[00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:40.296]  I would add.
[00:19:41.697 --> 00:19:43.118]  And it goes on for another page.
[00:19:43.338 --> 00:19:44.139]  Oh my gosh.
[00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:45.220]  I'll get more into this later.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.401]  We'll take your calls on this subject and others.
[00:19:48.322 --> 00:19:53.485]  We'll talk about the Iranian President's letter that they used for Birdcage Liner as soon as it hit the State Department.
[00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:56.868]  And Hillary and Fox News in a lip lock.
[00:19:56.908 --> 00:19:57.328]  Stay with us.

[00:21:00.865 --> 00:21:04.788]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:04.988 --> 00:21:17.278]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:18.099]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:23.724]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.124 --> 00:21:26.326]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.247]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:32.128]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.248 --> 00:21:38.290]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:38.691 --> 00:21:42.052]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:21:56.118 --> 00:21:58.779]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.881]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.901 --> 00:22:11.065]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.523]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office?
[00:22:16.744 --> 00:22:25.050]  We continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:27.400]  The handwriting is on the wall.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:36.127]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.189 --> 00:23:06.231]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:08.652]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big
[00:23:14.122 --> 00:23:14.562]  We're good.
[00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.510]  We're good to go.

[00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:27.150]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.030]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.531]  Go ahead.
[00:24:32.453 --> 00:24:33.014]  Hello, Alex.
[00:24:33.814 --> 00:24:34.735]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[00:24:34.755 --> 00:24:35.095]  Go ahead.
[00:24:35.376 --> 00:24:35.736]  Okay.
[00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:38.137]  A few things I want to touch on today.
[00:24:38.278 --> 00:24:42.320]  One thing is a New York State thing that I think may set a precedent throughout the country.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.962]  It may be a bellwether if this is to happen or to pass.
[00:24:46.043 --> 00:24:51.467]  They want to enact a law now in which people, when charged with misdemeanor offenses,
[00:24:52.423 --> 00:24:55.725]  Misdemeanor offenses have DNA samples taken.
[00:24:56.466 --> 00:24:58.888]  There's almost just about no limitation.
[00:24:58.948 --> 00:25:02.690]  They're using all kinds of rhetoric to try and pressure to get this law passed.
[00:25:03.551 --> 00:25:14.759]  My recommendation is to people in New York State that hear this broadcast, who have any conscience about this, they've got to realize that this is just any flimsy attempt to scoop up your DNA.
[00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:19.002]  They'll use any flimsy excuse to do that to get as many in the data.
[00:25:19.002 --> 00:25:26.465]  Well, all over the country, it's anyone who's arrested now, even for traffic violations, they're trying to pass state laws to take DNA.
[00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.345]  England's doing something similar.
[00:25:28.365 --> 00:25:38.809]  What people don't know is, crime labs have been caught from Houston, at the local level, the county city level, all the way up to the FBI crime lab, manufacturing fake DNA evidence.
[00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:41.190]  DNA evidence is not 100% as we've been told.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.360]  No, it's not.
[00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:52.985]  It's a little bit more complex than the average person would know, so they mislead a lot of juries with it and make them think that it's the magic or silver bullet to cure all criminal problems.
[00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:56.026]  In fact, it's not, but that's very long to get into.
[00:25:56.666 --> 00:26:01.108]  However, you know, you shouldn't have them scooping up DNA, certainly for minor offenses.
[00:26:01.128 --> 00:26:03.229]  As a matter of fact, one of the big arguing points
[00:26:05.134 --> 00:26:13.532]  On the part of those state representatives against this, is that police will take DNA in an investigation to eliminate people who haven't even been charged.
[00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:25.133]  And they don't even want to get rid of, in other words... Sir, they've had cases, what was the case down in Louisiana two years ago where they arrested or made thousands come in and give DNA because of a murder, remember that?
[00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:26.013]  Yes, I do.
[00:26:26.674 --> 00:26:35.116]  And if that was New York State and probably the case in Louisiana, they will not take that DNA out of the database once it's established that they're totally innocent people.
[00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:40.338]  So they're just using any flimsy reason, literally, to soak up your DNA.
[00:26:40.878 --> 00:26:41.978]  This is diabolical.
[00:26:42.018 --> 00:26:46.339]  This is the trademark of a government that's behaving in the most suspect ways.
[00:26:46.859 --> 00:27:00.062]  Well, I mean, if you're upset about that, Ron, which I'm upset and I'm glad you're upset about it, I've had congressmen on, it must have been five years ago, last time I really talked about this, did you know starting 33 years ago, anyone 33 years old or younger,
[00:27:03.147 --> 00:27:11.775]  Every major health department affiliated hospital in the country takes three ampules of blood and they tell you, oh, it's for a blood test.
[00:27:11.795 --> 00:27:13.757]  Well, they could do that blood test there at the hospital.
[00:27:14.237 --> 00:27:16.279]  And they go, oh, it's going to the health department.
[00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:26.708]  And indeed, the health screening for blood diseases is done at the health department, but the other two ampules are sent to very quietly held federal databases.
[00:27:26.869 --> 00:27:28.050]  One is in Lansing, Michigan.
[00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:29.470]  We're good to go.
[00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:49.539]  We're good to go.
[00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:16.295]  In the last twenty-something years, and now it's thirty-three years, thirty-three, almost thirty-four years ago, in England, Canada, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand.
[00:28:16.315 --> 00:28:21.118]  I call it the Echelon Group of Countries, because all five of those countries work through Echelon.
[00:28:21.298 --> 00:28:23.279]  Here it will be Head Start.
[00:28:23.339 --> 00:28:24.800]  In England it will be Smart Start.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.162]  Every program has the same name, or almost the same name.
[00:28:28.462 --> 00:28:34.626]  It's all done exactly the same, controlled by the same... It's a global grid.
[00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:37.767]  And so all of us have our blood in their database.
[00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:41.109]  Yes, I'm aware that's been going on since the early 1970s.
[00:28:41.309 --> 00:28:43.390]  Absolutely, and it was quiet for quite a long time.
[00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:46.172]  You know, it's too much.
[00:28:47.072 --> 00:28:48.273]  You've got to suspect.
[00:28:48.413 --> 00:28:54.436]  Nobody can be so silly and so naive as to think that when a government engages in this, it has your interests at heart.
[00:28:55.317 --> 00:29:00.859]  And another thing on a government front, for everybody who thinks that... I'm going to stop you, and then I'll hold you over, Ronald, if I need you.
[00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:01.800]  I'm going to make this point.
[00:29:02.432 --> 00:29:09.114]  They kept the Manhattan Project secret for three years with over 2,000 people involved in it full time.
[00:29:09.394 --> 00:29:11.575]  So I don't want to hear they can't keep the blood secret.
[00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:15.176]  The blood is public and still no one that I talk to knows about it.
[00:29:15.436 --> 00:29:17.076]  And people at hospitals laugh at you.
[00:29:17.096 --> 00:29:18.336]  They don't even know where they're sending it.
[00:29:18.977 --> 00:29:20.657]  And it's the same thing with 9-11.
[00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:22.718]  It's the same thing with any of this criminality.
[00:29:23.918 --> 00:29:24.678]  They're doing it.
[00:29:24.738 --> 00:29:26.079]  They do get caught doing it.
[00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:27.419]  And they don't stop doing it.
[00:29:28.186 --> 00:29:30.348]  So, you know, it's the same across the board.
[00:29:30.388 --> 00:29:33.310]  It shows how maniacal these individuals are.
[00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.010]  Ron, stay there.
[00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.771]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:36.372]  Ron calls in every few weeks.
[00:29:36.412 --> 00:29:38.213]  He's a retired New York police detective.
[00:29:38.233 --> 00:29:40.114]  We always love having him on with us.
[00:29:40.134 --> 00:29:41.035]  A lot of great insight.
[00:29:41.715 --> 00:29:43.757]  This is serious, serious business.
[00:29:44.437 --> 00:29:45.058]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:51.362]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.822 --> 00:29:53.463]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.483 --> 00:29:57.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.979 --> 00:30:03.060]  What has been deemed the healthiest oil on the earth?
[00:30:03.621 --> 00:30:04.741]  Virgin Coconut Oil.
[00:30:05.061 --> 00:30:07.443]  What did Woman's Day magazine call the miracle oil?
[00:30:07.983 --> 00:30:09.043]  Virgin Coconut Oil.
[00:30:09.484 --> 00:30:14.867]  Why have people reported increased energy, reduction in food craving, and an easier time losing weight?
[00:30:15.327 --> 00:30:16.628]  Virgin Coconut Oil.
[00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:17.908]  The answer is clear.
[00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:21.090]  It's time to switch to Virgin Coconut Oil by Nourishing Planet.
[00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.591]  Made from organic coconuts,
[00:30:22.911 --> 00:30:26.733]  Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil is produced in the pristine Fiji Islands.
[00:30:27.233 --> 00:30:36.618]  Using coconuts within hours of opening, Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil retains more of the nutrition, including the tocotrienols, which are powerful vitamin E antioxidants.
[00:30:36.958 --> 00:30:41.881]  The minimally processed coconuts allow for delightful taste and the aroma of fresh coconuts.

[00:33:03.872 --> 00:33:05.393]  This show is documented.
[00:33:05.913 --> 00:33:08.674]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:09.074 --> 00:33:12.595]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:17.096]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:17.656 --> 00:33:19.397]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:24.739 --> 00:33:31.542]  Later in the broadcast I'll be playing Neil Young's new song, one off of his new album.
[00:33:31.562 --> 00:33:33.943]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:33:34.463 --> 00:33:42.226]  We'll be getting into Iran, the letter that the Iranian President sent that was used as toilet paper by Condi Rice and Lord Bush and others.
[00:33:42.246 --> 00:33:44.407]  It's an interesting letter everyone should read.
[00:33:45.166 --> 00:34:00.537]  And, of course, we do have Erin Zellman, who is the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, joining us at the bottom of the next hour about some new important moves against the Second Amendment that are taking place right now that the mainline gun organizations aren't going to tell you about because they're bought and paid for by the New World Order.
[00:34:00.697 --> 00:34:01.498]  Yes, it's true.
[00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:04.220]  And more on Hillary and Rupert Murdoch.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.540]  I keep talking about this.
[00:34:06.201 --> 00:34:08.162]  A lot of people just can't face the truth.
[00:34:08.923 --> 00:34:11.885]  And you're going to have to face it when Fox News starts promoting Hillary.
[00:34:13.237 --> 00:34:15.998]  Of course, at that point, he'll probably just worship her and kneel before her.
[00:34:16.498 --> 00:34:20.580]  I don't mean our listeners, but some of the neocons out there that occasionally tune in.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.721]  Let's go back to Ron in New York, let him finish up, and we'll go to other callers.
[00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:24.401]  Go ahead, Ron.
[00:34:24.622 --> 00:34:25.162]  Yes, Alex.
[00:34:25.222 --> 00:34:25.982]  Two more points.
[00:34:26.062 --> 00:34:40.608]  That starting next month also, the Center for Disease Control, I believe it is, is initiating federal protocols that doctors, when they do a routine checkup of any patient, regardless of background or circumstances, must now also conduct an AIDS test.
[00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:43.215]  Know that that's going to start next month.
[00:34:45.037 --> 00:34:52.783]  Well, they have these other little regulations they pass where the doctor's got to snoop on you and ask you if you have guns or... Yeah, they do that too.
[00:34:52.803 --> 00:34:53.883]  That's just one more though.
[00:34:54.404 --> 00:35:04.131]  They'll now be, every time you go in for a routine checkup to your physician, they will be required by federal regulation to conduct an AIDS test, an HIV AIDS test on you.
[00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:05.372]  But everyone's... No matter who you are.
[00:35:06.247 --> 00:35:08.268]  So you'll have to have a needle jab in your arm?
[00:35:08.529 --> 00:35:09.089]  Absolutely.
[00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:10.010]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.810]  I don't like needles.
[00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:11.390]  Absolutely not.
[00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:16.354]  And I would suggest anybody who respects himself as an American certainly protest that.
[00:35:16.394 --> 00:35:17.334]  Well, here's an example.
[00:35:17.675 --> 00:35:26.420]  Three years ago, or two and a half years ago, I went with my wife and son to SeaWorld San Antonio, and they just put the hand scanners in.
[00:35:27.001 --> 00:35:28.542]  And they said, sir, you have to do it.
[00:35:28.602 --> 00:35:29.822]  And I said, no, I don't.
[00:35:30.543 --> 00:35:32.004]  And they said, okay, you can go through.
[00:35:32.614 --> 00:35:55.823]  Well, I went back a few weeks ago with my family and now they say that most people refuse and they say just go on through without doing it and I sat there and I videotaped all these poor sheep going ahead and going along with it and sometime later in the next few weeks I'll put a little piece together of that little ten minute piece and put it on InfoWars.com and on the local TV show for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:35:56.923 --> 00:36:08.306]  This is going on, and so saying no, it's like the cops and the firemen and the first responders three years ago said no to the smallpox shot when they were ordered to take it, and then that whole program fell apart.
[00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.807]  And it's the same with this age test, which I did see out of New York State.
[00:36:12.107 --> 00:36:13.507]  You've just got to say no to that.
[00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:14.347]  Well, it's federal.
[00:36:14.387 --> 00:36:16.968]  It's going to be federally mandated guidelines, by the way.
[00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.109]  Federally mandated guidelines.
[00:36:19.189 --> 00:36:20.409]  But via the states, correct?
[00:36:21.404 --> 00:36:25.268]  Well, it's the federal government dictating to every doctor in every state that they must do this.
[00:36:25.528 --> 00:36:28.010]  Now, Ron, you're a retired police officer.
[00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:46.848]  What do you think of, meanwhile, the doctor's got to spy on you, got to take your bodily fluids for Uncle Sam, got to do all this Big Brother stuff, tattle on your neighbors, spy on your parents if you're in public schools, get prizes, but the president calls the Minutemen vigilantes and reports their every movement
[00:36:47.523 --> 00:36:53.085]  Using the military, the border patrol, and the FBI to the Mexican troops who openly deal drugs and kill cops.
[00:36:53.725 --> 00:37:04.989]  Oh, what I think is that it's time for us as American people to realize that the government of this country is not 365 people who sit in Washington, but 280 million people who reside in the country.
[00:37:05.409 --> 00:37:10.591]  And once we become conscious of that fact, then maybe we could begin to take our country back.
[00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.652]  Well, it's simple.
[00:37:13.052 --> 00:37:14.913]  I mean, give us your take.
[00:37:14.973 --> 00:37:15.693]  Why do you think
[00:37:16.585 --> 00:37:20.947]  They are so hell-bent on stopping the Minutemen and are helping our enemies defeat them.
[00:37:21.387 --> 00:37:25.349]  Well, because it interferes with their plan for this country.
[00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:35.873]  I believe that they do want to basically erase the borders, turn this into nothing more than a transnational economic zone, an international territory to be used.
[00:37:36.674 --> 00:37:37.294]  To be used!
[00:37:37.914 --> 00:37:39.175]  Yeah, basically a toilet.
[00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:40.155]  The world's toilet.
[00:37:40.435 --> 00:37:40.775]  That's it.
[00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:42.056]  To turn you into a toilet.
[00:37:43.007 --> 00:37:45.728]  And these guys, of course, interfere with that.
[00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:48.050]  They raise conscientiousness about this.
[00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.391]  And that's why they're trying to demonize them.
[00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:53.692]  I mean, even to the point that they're letting the Mexican government know?
[00:37:53.712 --> 00:38:03.497]  The so-called American government, and you must always use these terms, so-called American government, is telling the Mexican government where American citizens are?
[00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:09.093]  Trying to protect the borders and in fact enforce the statutory laws of the United States.
[00:38:09.133 --> 00:38:14.577]  And then meanwhile, and then meanwhile, inside the country, training us all how to be tattletales.
[00:38:15.097 --> 00:38:15.498]  That's right.
[00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:17.719]  We're in bad times and we're in danger.
[00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:20.661]  Look at this, you mentioned that thing about Rupert Murdoch and Hillary, right?
[00:38:21.602 --> 00:38:29.387]  Now for years and years, Rupert Murdoch has always been posed to us, this Australian editor of a newspaper and owner of Fox News,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.827]  As you know, this great Bubba good ol' boy right winger, and he's holding a campaign fundraiser for Hillary.
[00:38:37.007 --> 00:38:40.631]  One of the most infamous political figures in the history of the country in the last hundred years.
[00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:42.141]  And you're right.
[00:38:42.421 --> 00:38:43.582]  We're going to have that phony.
[00:38:44.142 --> 00:39:01.888]  We're going to have that phony Hannity, eventually probably get on the air, whack-a-head phony, patent leather phony, and then try to twist and turn and spin things so that all of a sudden you're going to be made to look at Hillary Clinton like she's, you know, this fine Reaganite conservative.
[00:39:02.528 --> 00:39:03.289]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.949]  So we've got to
[00:39:04.918 --> 00:39:06.178]  Well, they're already doing that.
[00:39:06.198 --> 00:39:09.259]  They've already got the neocons with their talking points saying, look at Hillary.
[00:39:09.299 --> 00:39:11.140]  She's come over to sanity.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.960]  She's doing the right thing.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.941]  Even Hillary, but the evil liberals don't like her.
[00:39:16.401 --> 00:39:16.801]  Why?
[00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:17.662]  Why?
[00:39:17.842 --> 00:39:19.442]  George Clooney doesn't like her.
[00:39:19.522 --> 00:39:22.603]  So if you don't like Hillary, you're a liberal.
[00:39:22.783 --> 00:39:23.943]  Yeah, you're a liberal.
[00:39:23.963 --> 00:39:24.924]  They're already doing it.
[00:39:24.944 --> 00:39:26.284]  I mean, I don't know if you've been tuning in.
[00:39:26.904 --> 00:39:27.884]  They're already doing it!
[00:39:27.924 --> 00:39:45.950]  Look, we're liberals because we don't want to turn our guns in, and we don't want our borders open, and we don't like Bush spending more money than all presidents combined, and we don't like him signing UN treaties, and we don't like him attacking innocent countries, and we don't like him setting up domestic CIA, and we don't like the head of the NSA saying there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.430]  I mean, these people are sick!
[00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.571]  But there's an easier way to say it than that.
[00:39:49.851 --> 00:39:53.492]  I don't want to turn my soul over to people who have no souls at all.
[00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:55.350]  That's what I don't want to do.
[00:39:55.490 --> 00:40:01.975]  Hillary Clinton is a monster and no matter how much perfume these neocons put on her, she's still a fat pig.
[00:40:02.035 --> 00:40:02.756]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:03.316 --> 00:40:03.777]  Welcome.
[00:40:04.097 --> 00:40:05.778]  And I don't mean that physically a fat pig.
[00:40:05.818 --> 00:40:08.460]  I mean her soul is a big fat pig goblin.
[00:40:09.021 --> 00:40:10.362]  I mean she makes me sick!
[00:40:11.823 --> 00:40:12.003]  Ugh!
[00:40:12.023 --> 00:40:13.644]  I can't stand Hillary Clinton!
[00:40:14.625 --> 00:40:15.986]  I wish they could just go away.
[00:40:16.246 --> 00:40:17.127]  I've got some good news.
[00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:18.088]  Clinton was up speaking.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:27.030]  What was it in Ohio, just a few days ago, and the hall held, I think it was 2,000 people, the news article said, and only like 700 showed up?
[00:40:27.891 --> 00:40:32.117]  I mean, I could go to a speaking engagement at a college and 2,000 would show up!
[00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:32.858]  Ha!
[00:40:33.138 --> 00:40:33.879]  Bill Clinton!
[00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:34.620]  I'm nobody!
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.561]  It's good!
[00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:37.704]  You're a piece of garbage, Bill Clinton!
[00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:40.200]  And I don't care if George Bush Sr.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.200]  and George Jr.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.920]  say you're great.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.861]  You're not great, and they're not great either.
[00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.362]  I know I'm a liberal because I don't love them.
[00:40:46.682 --> 00:40:48.743]  You stupid neocons out there.
[00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:50.263]  You people are scum!
[00:40:51.904 --> 00:40:53.064]  Oh man, we're in trouble.
[00:40:53.644 --> 00:40:55.005]  I'm sorry, I'm getting real mad.
[00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:57.026]  I just am so sick of Hillary Clinton.
[00:40:57.406 --> 00:41:01.567]  I'm so sick of her, and I'm so sick of all the things she tried to do with this country.
[00:41:02.087 --> 00:41:05.629]  Communist medicine, which is for the bankers, handing over everything to them.
[00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:06.649]  Not for you, the people.
[00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:22.513]  Just all the gun control, the open borders, the Christmas trees with crack pipes on them, the Jorge Cabrera known convicted cocaine dealers giving her money at the White House, communist generals in the White House selling out our secrets.
[00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:26.436]  I mean, making me sick.
[00:41:27.457 --> 00:41:29.218]  And now we're evil liberals.
[00:41:29.699 --> 00:41:30.139]  I've heard them.
[00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:32.581]  What do you mean, Ron, they're going to be saying that?
[00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:33.782]  They're already doing it!
[00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:40.608]  Oh, it's just, it's just, there's no end to it.
[00:41:40.768 --> 00:41:42.069]  There's no end.
[00:41:43.509 --> 00:41:45.610]  Mark in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.331]  Hi Alex, this is Mark in Northeast Wisconsin.
[00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:53.372]  I got a pub story where I didn't get beat up like that guy you were talking to yesterday there.
[00:41:53.392 --> 00:42:04.136]  And, uh, what happened was I was bringing up 9-11 and, you know, the facts about the buildings and telephones don't work up, you know, up 30,000 feet and
[00:42:06.229 --> 00:42:10.372]  And I was getting reneged by this gentleman alongside of me and he seemed quite intelligent.
[00:42:10.392 --> 00:42:19.419]  We were talking quite a while and then after quite a few beers he opened up a little bit and I opened up and I asked him, uh, where'd you retire from?
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.222]  He got kind of quiet and then he answered, well, you're not going to believe this.
[00:42:23.282 --> 00:42:25.264]  I retired from the NSA after 30 years.
[00:42:26.485 --> 00:42:31.349]  So the first word that came out of my mouth was echelon and he got that look on his face like David Gergen there.
[00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:35.412]  And, uh, and I brought up some facts about that and he says, well,
[00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:41.672]  You're right about a lot of that and there's a lot of things I can't talk about because I'm still under oath even after I'm retired.
[00:42:41.732 --> 00:42:50.700]  The guy pretty much tried to put me down and I brought up the number 7 building there and he didn't seem to remember that that went down in the afternoon.
[00:42:51.721 --> 00:43:00.188]  But he said the cell phones do work above 30,000 feet and those buildings fell from the hot flames and on and on.
[00:43:00.368 --> 00:43:02.530]  Cell phones admittedly don't work at 30,000 feet.
[00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.311]  Yeah, I know that.
[00:43:04.858 --> 00:43:05.439]  I don't know.
[00:43:22.379 --> 00:43:27.224]  Shielding around the plane, there's so much movement in the signal, it breaks up then.
[00:43:27.264 --> 00:43:29.486]  It breaks up immediately on takeoff.
[00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:33.690]  But they've done studies, 2000 is the maximum shielding with the cell phones.
[00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.993]  It's just, it's total bull.
[00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:44.481]  But for those that don't know, I said I'd have the article, a little blurb up, just the basics, that there in South Carolina, a veteran,
[00:43:45.538 --> 00:44:07.234]  That was simply sitting at the bar table, you know, on the stool, brought up 9-11, brought up some films he'd seen, the man he was talking to agreed with him, and the head of the hall came up and said, get out of here, and he said, no I have a right, and sat back down, and they assaulted him, the guy was arrested, along with three other guys, but they haven't been arrested yet, and
[00:44:09.337 --> 00:44:11.518]  The crazy part is they then banned him.
[00:44:11.558 --> 00:44:15.701]  The person that assaulted him then banned him from that VFW hall.
[00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:20.423]  And so we put a little report up last night, but it had a typo or two in it, so I pulled it this morning.
[00:44:20.983 --> 00:44:21.644]  We're fixing it.
[00:44:21.704 --> 00:44:27.527]  It's really a piece of cake article, but it'll be up there soon on InfoWars.com.
[00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:29.127]  And it's just outrageous.
[00:44:29.147 --> 00:44:30.408]  What did you think when you heard that story?
[00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:36.509]  It totally blew my mind because they're a little bit more gentlemanly up here in Wisconsin.
[00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:37.710]  There was no problem like that.
[00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:41.773]  A lot of people were kind of listening in and thought I was a conspiracy nut and whatnot.
[00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:48.478]  But then I kind of changed the talk a little bit and I brought up what about the torture and all that.
[00:44:48.999 --> 00:44:59.748]  This gentleman, he was absolutely against torture completely and he had a friend that still works for the CIA and he's an interrogator and his friend, they're absolutely against this torture.
[00:44:59.768 --> 00:45:00.888]  He says it does not work.
[00:45:00.908 --> 00:45:02.630]  You will not get a decent confession.
[00:45:03.513 --> 00:45:04.734]  We agreed with me on that.
[00:45:04.754 --> 00:45:05.454]  No, no, no.
[00:45:05.755 --> 00:45:08.537]  Giving people cigarettes and beer gets the confession.
[00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:14.561]  You're giving their friends, and they have whole, you know, encyclopedic textbooks on this.
[00:45:15.342 --> 00:45:22.267]  Well, the beer opened up, you know, got us talking, and then we had a really gentleman conversation for about three hours, and he brought up the Upper Peninsula of Michigan here.
[00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:28.051]  There's some really nasty jailing going on up there, and I don't know if there's one of those concentration sites in the UP or not, but
[00:45:28.877 --> 00:45:33.240]  Kind of like what it sounded like, and he was absolutely against us jailing people for money.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.003]  Sir, they have black sites all over the US, black world sites all over Europe, it's admitted.
[00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:39.204]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:40.064 --> 00:45:42.186]  Exciting phone call to hear those folks were waking up.
[00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:43.954]  Well, you know, that's the thing.
[00:45:44.014 --> 00:45:51.139]  The only thing torture works for is terror, is fear in the general population, and for false confessions.
[00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:53.521]  It does not get you good intelligence.
[00:45:53.621 --> 00:45:54.341]  It never has.
[00:45:54.441 --> 00:45:55.102]  It never will.
[00:45:55.142 --> 00:45:56.102]  History shows that.
[00:45:56.543 --> 00:45:58.984]  We've interviewed top interrogators on this program.
[00:45:59.485 --> 00:46:01.146]  It does not work.
[00:46:03.267 --> 00:46:05.509]  All it does is ensure that your troops get tortured.
[00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:08.091]  Because what are we going to do next time somebody grabs our troops and tortures them?
[00:46:08.737 --> 00:46:12.278]  They'll go, how dare the enemy torture them, that's incredibly evil!
[00:46:12.678 --> 00:46:15.338]  Saddam tortured, he had rape rooms!
[00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:18.759]  Yeah, our government trained Saddam, that's declassified.
[00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:22.280]  Trained by the CIA for two years, 1958 to 1960.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.781]  Head of Ba'athist security, put into power in 1969.
[00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:29.061]  Coup d'etat in 1979.
[00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:33.762]  A few months later they launched the attack on Iran, all staged by our government.
[00:46:35.663 --> 00:46:38.464]  And the President of Iran put that in his grievance.
[00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:40.524]  He said, you overthrew our government in 1953.
[00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:46.145]  He didn't even mention when our government admits they carried out terror attacks to do it, to blame it on Mossadegh.
[00:46:46.805 --> 00:46:54.166]  Blew up our own jetliners, blew up our own ships, tried to constantly overthrow our country, put sanctions on us.
[00:46:55.247 --> 00:47:02.428]  By the way, our government admittedly right now, the illegitimate government, admittedly for a year has special forces troops in Iran, foreign troops,
[00:47:03.283 --> 00:47:07.785]  And they say that when Israel attacks Iran, that if they fight back, they're evil.
[00:47:08.165 --> 00:47:09.685]  Now, I mean, can you imagine?
[00:47:09.705 --> 00:47:12.906]  We're going to attack you, and you don't fight back, okay?
[00:47:12.926 --> 00:47:13.446]  Or you're bad.
[00:47:15.247 --> 00:47:16.607]  Let's talk to Tom in Tennessee.
[00:47:16.647 --> 00:47:17.228]  Tom, welcome.
[00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:18.448]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:19.228]  You're on the roll today.
[00:47:19.968 --> 00:47:26.831]  I was talking to someone yesterday, and I'm a relatively new listener, and he asked a question I couldn't answer.
[00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:27.671]  I was wondering if you could help me.
[00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:35.261]  I was presenting facts like NORAD staying down and several of the other, with Giuliani and 15 Minutes getting out of the building and everything.
[00:47:35.821 --> 00:47:54.496]  He asked me about, this actually goes along with the cell phone calls, he said, so what were the moms making it up when their sons, when they had the recordings of their sons calling and when they went on and were doing books and things like that about their sons calling and leaving messages, hearing their voices,
[00:47:55.268 --> 00:48:02.492]  And I wasn't sure if that was staged or whether they were able to use the computer software to generate those voices somehow.
[00:48:02.692 --> 00:48:07.635]  Is it similar to how 007 when they said that the Russians had shot them down?
[00:48:07.995 --> 00:48:12.278]  I'm wondering about the similarities and how I can actually answer the questions.
[00:48:12.995 --> 00:48:16.556]  That seemed to be legitimate when face value.
[00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:27.819]  Well, we're hearing all these questions because people go into a dark movie theater, they're hypnotized, they focus on the big luminous screen, and they suspend disbelief, and they absorb what they see as reality.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:28.440]  Okay?
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.841]  Now, bottom line, I answered this question actually yesterday, but I'll do it again.
[00:48:33.861 --> 00:48:36.042]  I'm getting this question every day now, and that's fine.
[00:48:36.062 --> 00:48:40.243]  In fact, I even got it around the same time of the show, but I'll answer it again.
[00:48:40.263 --> 00:48:41.784]  No, no, that's an important question.
[00:48:41.804 --> 00:48:42.644]  I'm glad you're asking it.
[00:48:44.253 --> 00:48:48.615]  The official story they tell us from end to end is a fraud.
[00:48:49.716 --> 00:48:53.038]  We know that the official story we've been given is a lie.
[00:48:53.078 --> 00:48:55.159]  They've changed it so many times it's ridiculous.
[00:48:55.739 --> 00:49:04.924]  We then know that the Arabs couldn't have NORAD stand down, couldn't put bombs in the buildings, couldn't warn public officials not to fly, couldn't have the war games that day.
[00:49:05.665 --> 00:49:08.326]  Bin Laden's known CIA on and on and on.
[00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:10.007]  CIA insider trading.
[00:49:11.986 --> 00:49:14.508]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones calling you from a local hospital.
[00:49:14.588 --> 00:49:16.550]  One of my friends this morning started to basically die.
[00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:17.951]  He's going to be dying here probably pretty soon.
[00:49:34.292 --> 00:49:35.995]  He's on the edge of death right now.
[00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:38.580]  The reason I'm calling in is because there's so much important news today.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.408]  I feel really bad not being here for the live broadcast, but I'll be in in the next 30 minutes.
[00:49:43.086 --> 00:49:47.449]  To an hour, so I can cover Bush's propaganda about troops on the border.
[00:49:47.489 --> 00:49:48.230]  It's a total lie.
[00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:52.073]  Everything else that's happening, it's just... So I'm sorry I'm not here live for you folks.
[00:49:52.453 --> 00:49:55.095]  I'll be in the middle of the next hour, cover all the news for you.
[00:49:55.515 --> 00:49:57.777]  I'm just here in South Austin at a hospital.
[00:49:57.817 --> 00:50:02.941]  My best friend is about to pass, and as soon as he passes, I'll be there.
[00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:05.683]  If he hangs on, I may not be there later, but I'll probably be there.
[00:50:05.723 --> 00:50:06.223]  God bless.
[00:50:06.383 --> 00:50:06.724]  Stay with us.
[00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.931]  Okay, it will fool anyone.
[00:50:16.551 --> 00:50:17.572]  And then it gets even easier.
[00:50:17.592 --> 00:50:20.213]  You get these phone calls to answering machines.
[00:50:20.693 --> 00:50:21.473]  I'm on the phone.
[00:50:21.674 --> 00:50:22.334]  Hijackers.
[00:50:22.614 --> 00:50:23.414]  They've got bombs.
[00:50:24.115 --> 00:50:29.117]  They actually had to get the people's voices and then use it and generate that.
[00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:31.918]  Yes, but they don't have to have their voices saying it exactly.
[00:50:32.178 --> 00:50:35.280]  They can get a phone print, record the person, the target,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:46.390]  Okay, and then real time, even if you say, you know, you're an NSA spook, the private contractor now, black world op, running it via satellite phone out of, say, Wiesbaden, Germany.
[00:50:47.051 --> 00:50:51.796]  You call, Mama even answers, and you go, Mama, it's me, they've hijacked, it's on the plane.
[00:50:52.036 --> 00:50:54.719]  And when she hears it, it's, hey Mama, I'm in trouble.
[00:50:54.999 --> 00:50:57.081]  See, it's precise.
[00:50:57.401 --> 00:50:59.183]  We'll be right back, stay there.
[00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:04.401]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:04.681 --> 00:51:06.242]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:51:23.795 --> 00:51:26.277]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:26.477 --> 00:51:33.063]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:33.303 --> 00:51:40.529]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:54:05.599 --> 00:54:07.281]  This story broke yesterday on air.
[00:54:07.341 --> 00:54:09.662]  We're posting it on Infowars.com right now.
[00:54:09.742 --> 00:54:14.725]  Veteran assaulted and banned by VFW Post for questioning official 9-11 story.
[00:54:16.338 --> 00:54:17.639]  Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:26.727]  An American patriot who served in combat was allegedly assaulted April 1st 2006 at a VFW post 445 for voicing comments.
[00:54:27.768 --> 00:54:39.598]  Richard Scram has been arrested and charged for allegedly assaulting photographer mate second-class Mark Dury in Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:54:39.698 --> 00:54:40.039]  Dury
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:46.822]  Indicated that he required medical attention for his injuries, and he's going to send us a photograph of that.
[00:54:47.742 --> 00:54:53.524]  He reported to us, we should add, that he was assaulted, and the police have confirmed it.
[00:54:53.564 --> 00:55:00.766]  We've talked to them, and we've got the arrest reports up on the article that we posted on JonesReport.com, going up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:55:01.306 --> 00:55:02.046]  Subsequently,
[00:55:03.268 --> 00:55:13.155]  Durie has had his canteen privileges suspended and may be permanently barred from the locale for his role in the incident on April 1st, 2006.
[00:55:13.195 --> 00:55:23.122]  This is ironic since Durie was allegedly assaulted by Schramm, who was the post commander and is now its quartermaster.
[00:55:23.142 --> 00:55:26.204]  There was an election last night and they removed him as commander.
[00:55:26.244 --> 00:55:27.365]  He's now quartermaster.
[00:55:28.132 --> 00:55:38.982]  This very person who was charged for assaulting Mr. DeRee has been barred from the VFW post, which DeRee has a right to frequent as a dues-paying veteran.
[00:55:40.223 --> 00:55:50.313]  So the very person that allegedly assaulted Mr. DeRee, who's been charged with it, is the very one that barred him from being able to go back to the VFW.
[00:55:50.593 --> 00:55:53.856]  And we have all the documents and all the arrest history there.
[00:55:55.126 --> 00:56:02.852]  The circumstances, the reason I'm babbling through this is the printer printed this so small that even with 20-20 vision I'm having to focus to read this.
[00:56:03.552 --> 00:56:06.174]  These circumstances are very dangerous for free speech.
[00:56:06.554 --> 00:56:08.696]  It is one of the most important
[00:56:09.722 --> 00:56:15.666]  It is of the utmost importance that Mark Dury has his access to the VFW Post 445 reinstated.
[00:56:15.726 --> 00:56:25.153]  Otherwise, it is a precedent that a citizen of the United States can be first assaulted for voicing his views and then punished for creating a quote, incident.
[00:56:25.893 --> 00:56:33.739]  According to the account of Mr. Dury, he was considering problems with the official 9-11 story and discussing such films
[00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:38.255]  As Marshall Law, 9-11, rise of the police state, loose change.
[00:56:38.775 --> 00:56:42.419]  Again, on air he said loose change, but we talked to him prior.
[00:56:42.459 --> 00:56:45.402]  He was talking about a lot of 9-11 stuff and Marshall Law, so we added that.
[00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:50.747]  Schramm and others at the VFW's canteen overheard him and told him to shut up or get out.
[00:56:51.127 --> 00:56:53.730]  When Durie refused, Schramm
[00:56:54.534 --> 00:57:01.820]  Allegedly attacked him from behind, then knocked Doree to the floor, where he was reportedly kicked and stomped by upwards of four individuals.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.143]  Richard Schramm could not be reached for comment Tuesday or Wednesday.
[00:57:06.183 --> 00:57:11.907]  An attempt was also made to reach the arresting officer, who was not reached for comment either, but the police department was.
[00:57:11.927 --> 00:57:13.088]  We did talk to the police department.
[00:57:13.408 --> 00:57:15.689]  The phone number for the VFW, we have that posted.
[00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:29.334]  And the Charleston County Court websites list Mr. Schramm's recent arrest that include, since 2000, not only the charge of assault and battery from this incident, but also DUI, reckless driving, and gambling, and unlawful games.
[00:57:29.754 --> 00:57:32.735]  And we have copies of all of those up there on the site.
[00:57:32.755 --> 00:57:34.976]  We'll start the second hour
[00:57:36.138 --> 00:57:46.122]  Get into Iran, get into the President's letter to our President, who literally was just totally undiplomatic, and we'll get to all of your calls for those of you that are holding.
[00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:54.685]  Before I end this hour and the next 30 seconds, we've got a big 9-11 event with the top speakers and myself, and my new film will be screened there first.
[00:57:55.145 --> 00:57:58.087]  June 24th and 25th, downtown LA at the Sheraton.

[00:58:34.258 --> 00:58:36.159]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:36.659]  Stay with us.

[00:58:57.476 --> 00:58:58.117]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.797 --> 00:58:59.838]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:01.680]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.141]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.882 --> 00:59:04.803]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.823 --> 00:59:09.186]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.647 --> 00:59:13.710]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:28.345]  Neil Young, who put out the Let's Roll song cashing in after 9-11 buying into the official fraud, has now gone public that he's been conned about the war and a lot more.
[00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:32.207]  I first had a chance last night to hear a few of the songs online.
[00:59:32.227 --> 00:59:34.809]  We're going to play one of them, The Secret Garden, later.
[00:59:35.695 --> 00:59:47.300]  In this hour, we have the director, the founder of Jews Preservation and Firearms Ownership, Aaron Zellman, joining us to talk about some really scary gun control coming down the federal pike, coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:56.703]  We'll take your calls right now, get into the Iran situation, this letter from their president to our president that was treated with the utmost of disrespect.
[00:59:56.723 --> 01:00:01.105]  I mean, even if Iran's evil and our government's loving and good, you still
[01:00:02.523 --> 01:00:07.306]  You know, consider a letter, especially one that's gracious, calling Bush's excellency and stuff.
[01:00:08.206 --> 01:00:09.307]  It's just, it's disgusting.
[01:00:09.347 --> 01:00:11.568]  So we'll get into that as well.
[01:00:12.688 --> 01:00:16.890]  And going up on InfoWars.com in the next few minutes, we're going to have the article about a veteran.
[01:00:17.251 --> 01:00:21.793]  We have the police reports assaulted for simply talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:00:22.093 --> 01:00:25.435]  And then banned from the VFW Hall by the very person that assaulted him.
[01:00:26.755 --> 01:00:28.156]  So this is quite rich.
[01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:33.358]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:00:33.518 --> 01:00:37.239]  Let's talk to Mike in North Carolina.
[01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:38.139]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:00:38.179 --> 01:00:38.519]  Welcome.
[01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:40.659]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:40.739 --> 01:00:53.762]  First thing, this past semester, I'm a community college teacher, and I've screened American Dictators, Loose Change, Second Edition, and Painful Deceptions to my students, and I probably had a 90-95% wake-up rate.
[01:00:57.728 --> 01:00:58.308]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:58.608 --> 01:00:59.549]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:59.609 --> 01:01:17.087]  I mean, I spent about 15-20 minutes per class throughout the course of the semester leading up to the documentary unit just going over the news off PrisonPlanet.com, WhatReallyHappened.com, and I really think that helped set the stage for such an unprecedented wake-up rate amongst my students.
[01:01:17.913 --> 01:01:19.294]  So congratulations.
[01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:20.916]  No, congratulations to you!
[01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:21.617]  Are you kidding?
[01:01:22.577 --> 01:01:25.640]  Did you get any feedback from other administrators or anybody?
[01:01:25.921 --> 01:01:31.866]  No, I'm very surprised with the amount of autonomy that I was granted.
[01:01:33.608 --> 01:01:35.569]  You know, none of the students complained.
[01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:40.554]  I think that they understood that I was just trying to get them to think.
[01:01:41.475 --> 01:01:43.677]  You know, whether or not they agree with me or not,
[01:01:44.403 --> 01:01:45.363]  They knew I didn't care.
[01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:47.804]  I was just trying to... Did you hold some type of vote?
[01:01:47.924 --> 01:01:50.405]  All of those that think it was an inside job, raise your hand.
[01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:56.087]  No, what it was is I had them, because we spent about six weeks... Oh yeah, write a report on it.
[01:01:56.148 --> 01:02:05.891]  Yeah, they had to write a summary on Super Size Me, then one on Walmart, or the Enron documentary, and then one of their choice.
[01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:12.974]  And a lot chose to write about loose change, and everything came back just totally positive.
[01:02:14.622 --> 01:02:16.243]  I tell you, that is so exciting!
[01:02:16.563 --> 01:02:26.468]  Yeah, and then my other comment that I wanted to make is, has a caller called in about the new industrial metal outfit, Ministry, putting their new album out?
[01:02:27.428 --> 01:02:33.671]  I'm told that Ministry is doing a music video, Dylan Avery is.
[01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:34.811]  Oh, really?
[01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:39.273]  Yeah, because I know this new album... It's about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:02:39.513 --> 01:02:39.833]  Totally.
[01:02:42.089 --> 01:02:54.663]  70-80% of the songs are about either Bush or Bin Laden, the war in Iraq, and it's just a total 60 minutes of hardcore political trash.
[01:02:54.783 --> 01:02:55.524]  It's awesome.
[01:02:57.294 --> 01:03:01.555]  Well, you know, Ministry, 15 years ago, had a song that would go, New World Order!
[01:03:02.075 --> 01:03:02.976]  It would have Bush Sr.
[01:03:03.016 --> 01:03:03.936]  sing, New World Order.
[01:03:04.336 --> 01:03:10.457]  And I was wondering, would it be alright if I just took another moment or two and read out some of the lyrical passages that I've assembled?
[01:03:10.577 --> 01:03:11.037]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:14.038]  Okay, the first one is from a song called, Butt Clowns.
[01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:15.659]  I've had to censor this a little bit.
[01:03:16.839 --> 01:03:25.181]  And the lines in this one go, I want to go to the circus, the circus of power, the circus they call Washington, a circle of dishonor.
[01:03:25.652 --> 01:03:28.093]  I want to round up the Senators just like they did in Rome.
[01:03:28.413 --> 01:03:30.893]  Feed these butt clowns to the lions, then I can go home.
[01:03:31.593 --> 01:03:35.034]  And there's just a whole bunch of just golden political lyrics on this album.
[01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:36.374]  Is that album out yet?
[01:03:36.655 --> 01:03:38.135]  Yes, it came out on the 2nd of May.
[01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:38.955]  What's the name of it?
[01:03:39.355 --> 01:03:40.335]  Rio Grande Blood.
[01:03:41.236 --> 01:03:42.236]  Rio Grande Blood.
[01:03:42.256 --> 01:03:43.996]  I'll have to get a copy.
[01:03:44.036 --> 01:03:45.257]  Maybe we'll play some of it.
[01:03:45.317 --> 01:03:46.157]  Alright, thank you.
[01:03:46.817 --> 01:03:48.417]  Very exciting call as well.
[01:03:48.877 --> 01:03:50.138]  More calls, more news.
[01:03:50.238 --> 01:03:51.058]  Straight ahead.
[01:03:51.118 --> 01:03:51.578]  Stay with us.
[01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.474]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:56.674 --> 01:04:01.098]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:02.459]  There is a chance.
[01:04:03.046 --> 01:04:05.627]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:08.488]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:04:08.788 --> 01:04:13.009]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:19.991]  We rip the Sinister Hatred Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:22.132]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:32.898]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:38.521]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:52.634 --> 01:04:55.635]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:55.975 --> 01:05:04.798]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:09.800]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:16.988]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:17.389 --> 01:05:29.163]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.643 --> 01:05:34.108]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:05:51.693 --> 01:05:53.694]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[01:05:53.855 --> 01:05:54.175]  Thanks.
[01:05:54.455 --> 01:05:56.697]  Last summer I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[01:05:56.797 --> 01:05:58.818]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[01:05:58.938 --> 01:06:00.339]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[01:06:00.399 --> 01:06:02.221]  See, this one looks thick, that one's yellow.
[01:06:02.301 --> 01:06:04.182]  What you need is Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:04.282 --> 01:06:07.424]  Non-X clears out the buildup that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:08.865]  It's called Keratin Debris.
[01:06:09.025 --> 01:06:10.266]  Just apply Non-X daily.
[01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:12.408]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[01:06:12.648 --> 01:06:13.448]  Just look at mine!
[01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:16.050]  The dietrist recommended Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:21.114]  Now at Walgreens, Long's, Eckerd Pharmacy, Rite Aid, and Brooks Pharmacy in the foot care section.
[01:06:23.047 --> 01:06:24.048]  Looking for profits?
[01:06:24.128 --> 01:06:25.509]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:29.051]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:36.377]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:06:36.737 --> 01:06:40.260]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.021]  Secure your position today.
[01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:43.502]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:43.802]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:54.412 --> 01:07:00.455]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.055 --> 01:07:04.036]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:24.014]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:34.082]  Aaron Zellman, Judge of Preservation of Firearms Ownership, is coming up here in about 22 minutes to talk about some new gun control legislation, and then he's a reporter who's been inside Fallujah during the war.
[01:07:34.182 --> 01:07:37.265]  He's been all over Iraq and the Middle East many times, Dar Jamal.
[01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:43.470]  He was just here last night in Austin giving a speech, and he'll be joining us again coming up in the next hour.
[01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:50.556]  For those that just joined us, we covered an Associated Press report about how the Mexican government brags, and our government admits,
[01:07:51.934 --> 01:08:00.019]  That the Border Patrol and others surveil the Minutemen and tell the Mexican troops and government their exact location at all times.
[01:08:02.714 --> 01:08:21.669]  Meanwhile, the government encourages American citizens to tattle on each other for anything and everything, but citizens peacefully calling the Border Patrol when they see hordes of illegal aliens and criminal smugglers, while their evil vigilantes in the Mexican government takes pot shots at them, routinely shoots at them, and has killed many police officers and others, but that's okay.
[01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.170]  Mexico's our friend.
[01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:24.051]  It's outrageous.
[01:08:25.993 --> 01:08:29.936]  Meanwhile, a few days ago, I'm sure most of you are aware, the president of
[01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:36.855]  Iran sent a letter via the Swiss Embassy to Conor Lisa Rice and President Bush.
[01:08:37.955 --> 01:08:42.738]  And I suggest you just type letter from Iranian President to President Bush into Google.
[01:08:43.138 --> 01:08:44.839]  You can read the actual letter itself.
[01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:48.461]  It is a groveling letter.
[01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:55.606]  He is begging Bush to be Christian and he is begging Bush to not attack them.
[01:08:55.726 --> 01:08:57.747]  He is telling Bush that he's a great
[01:08:58.516 --> 01:09:11.412]  A leader, that he's an excellency, and that they just want to live in peace, and that they forgive us, basically, for overthrowing their country in 53, which was a pro-America peaceful government, by the way.
[01:09:11.952 --> 01:09:14.916]  Our government carried out terror attacks, to blame it on Mossadegh.
[01:09:14.936 --> 01:09:16.077]  That's admittedly classified.
[01:09:16.578 --> 01:09:17.459]  CIA.gov.
[01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:23.183]  And he brings up how we blew up their jetliners, and how we've had sanctions on them, and all of this.
[01:09:23.263 --> 01:09:31.431]  And Iranians never done this, and geopolitical experts, even conservative experts, who studied the Persians, looked at this and they said, this is unprecedented.
[01:09:32.071 --> 01:09:36.936]  This is major face loss for him, especially since Bush snubbed it.
[01:09:37.696 --> 01:09:38.917]  These are very proud people.
[01:09:38.977 --> 01:09:41.640]  This is unheard of, unprecedented, never happened.
[01:09:42.413 --> 01:09:44.514]  Rice was very arrogant, giggled about it.
[01:09:44.894 --> 01:09:46.515]  I've got our Schneid comments here.
[01:09:46.575 --> 01:09:47.556]  This is nothing new.
[01:09:47.636 --> 01:09:48.736]  This is blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:49.137 --> 01:09:50.557]  This is manipulative.
[01:09:51.118 --> 01:09:52.819]  We're not even responding to it.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.521]  This is Iran trying to put out the olive branch.
[01:09:57.821 --> 01:10:00.603]  And by the way, Iran has never said they'd wipe Israel off the map.
[01:10:01.023 --> 01:10:03.764]  Iran has said if they're attacked, they will wipe it off the map.
[01:10:03.804 --> 01:10:04.985]  And Israel said that back.
[01:10:06.226 --> 01:10:10.648]  After Israel a few months ago said, we will attack you with nukes, they said, okay, well we'll wipe you off the map too.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:18.165]  When Bush and Cheney and Bolton said, we'll cause you great pain and suffering, they said, well, please don't do that.
[01:10:18.225 --> 01:10:19.446]  We want to work things out with you.
[01:10:19.486 --> 01:10:22.809]  I read the actual quotes by the president of Iran.
[01:10:22.849 --> 01:10:25.751]  Please don't do that, but we can also cause you great pain and suffering.
[01:10:26.171 --> 01:10:30.154]  Well, our media took it and just, Iranian president, we'll cause you great pain and suffering.
[01:10:33.036 --> 01:10:36.239]  That's like if I say, I'm coming over to your house and I'm going to kill you.
[01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.718]  And you say, over my dead body, I'm going to fight back.
[01:10:40.259 --> 01:10:42.160]  It might just be you that's pushing daisies.
[01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.922]  Alex Jones threatened me.
[01:10:44.982 --> 01:10:46.263]  Can you believe it?
[01:10:46.944 --> 01:10:54.991]  But again, we have an American people, two-thirds of which can't find Iraq or Iran or India or Pakistan on a map.
[01:10:55.031 --> 01:10:55.931]  I mean, how do you miss India?
[01:10:55.991 --> 01:10:56.612]  It sticks out.
[01:10:57.788 --> 01:11:07.694]  The vast majority of Americans don't know how many continents there are, and I talk about this every year, that they just have the same big National Geography study of college graduates and college students.
[01:11:08.994 --> 01:11:10.635]  You get the same numbers with adults.
[01:11:11.356 --> 01:11:14.397]  I mean, I'll have debates with adults who have multiple degrees.
[01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:19.040]  I'll be arguing with somebody at a coffee shop or, you know, at the grocery store.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.362]  Every once in a while they'll walk over and argue, and they'll always laugh.
[01:11:23.559 --> 01:11:25.200]  Man, you make up a lot of stuff.
[01:11:27.342 --> 01:11:30.664]  You claim there's cross-species genetic-engineered species.
[01:11:31.544 --> 01:11:32.625]  There's no such thing.
[01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:33.766]  I took biology.
[01:11:33.786 --> 01:11:35.367]  And I go, when did you take it?
[01:11:35.387 --> 01:11:36.207]  20 years ago?
[01:11:36.267 --> 01:11:37.829]  Well, yeah, I was 76.
[01:11:38.969 --> 01:11:44.093]  Well, just type spider goats into Google and you'll get CBS Nightly News.
[01:11:44.153 --> 01:11:45.474]  I mean, it's admitted, sir.
[01:11:45.554 --> 01:11:47.555]  Most of the foods we eat are cross-species.
[01:11:48.255 --> 01:11:49.196]  That's a lie!
[01:11:49.516 --> 01:11:50.577]  I used to respect you.
[01:11:50.677 --> 01:11:51.237]  I don't now.
[01:11:51.277 --> 01:11:52.058]  You're a liar.
[01:11:53.462 --> 01:11:54.963]  Okay, fine, thank you.
[01:11:55.824 --> 01:11:58.026]  Or a guy, some yuppie will ride by on some $50,000 Harley.
[01:11:58.066 --> 01:12:00.247]  This has happened like twice.
[01:12:00.267 --> 01:12:03.410]  They'll go, hey punk, keep talking about your black helicopters.
[01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:06.352]  And I'll go, hey, excuse me, why don't you come back and argue about it?
[01:12:07.092 --> 01:12:09.274]  I might get off this cycle and do something else.
[01:12:09.294 --> 01:12:12.356]  And of course my eyes start bugging out of my head and they just ride off.
[01:12:14.358 --> 01:12:16.459]  But the point here is, is I'm sick of it.
[01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:18.541]  I'm tired of you being dumb.
[01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.123]  Look, I'm not that smart.
[01:12:22.196 --> 01:12:23.957]  I don't have that high view of myself.
[01:12:24.017 --> 01:12:24.698]  I really don't!
[01:12:27.379 --> 01:12:31.622]  I'm amazed by the skilled craftsmen I know, these incredible carpenters.
[01:12:31.702 --> 01:12:35.044]  I'm amazed by farmers and ranchers I know and the skills they know.
[01:12:35.064 --> 01:12:36.705]  I'm amazed by doctor skills.
[01:12:36.765 --> 01:12:39.107]  I'm amazed by chiropractor skills.
[01:12:39.167 --> 01:12:41.228]  I'm amazed by school teachers.
[01:12:41.268 --> 01:12:46.792]  And I'm amazed by artisans and filmmakers and musicians I know.
[01:12:47.272 --> 01:12:48.873]  I don't have that high view of myself.
[01:12:48.953 --> 01:12:51.455]  I can't play a harmonica, much less a violin.
[01:12:52.913 --> 01:12:56.477]  I don't know how to build a barn in two days.
[01:12:56.777 --> 01:12:57.938]  I don't know how to do a lot of things.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.223]  I don't know all the football and baseball scores either.
[01:13:02.363 --> 01:13:04.445]  You see, you're not dumb out there.
[01:13:04.545 --> 01:13:05.486]  You've been diverted.
[01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:13.817]  You're experts on how to act cool, how to have a bunch of friends, how to have all the leisure you can, how to max out your credit cards.
[01:13:14.298 --> 01:13:17.420]  You're an expert on how to go play pool every night and get drunk.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:23.123]  You're an expert on how to have the best cosmetics and sleep with the most men if you're one of the women out there.
[01:13:23.484 --> 01:13:28.227]  You're an expert on all this stuff, but you don't know anything about the world.
[01:13:30.521 --> 01:13:32.502]  Do you know about the sun's history?
[01:13:32.522 --> 01:13:33.843]  Do you know about the planets?
[01:13:34.323 --> 01:13:35.703]  Do you know the order of the planets?
[01:13:35.743 --> 01:13:38.344]  Do you know just basic stuff?
[01:13:38.985 --> 01:13:40.686]  Do you know who invented the light bulb?
[01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:44.507]  Do you know who invented electricity or who captured it first?
[01:13:45.147 --> 01:13:46.448]  It was one of our Founding Fathers.
[01:13:48.529 --> 01:13:50.530]  I mean, do you know who our Founding Fathers were?
[01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:52.931]  Do you know what the first Ten Amendments to the Bill of Rights are?
[01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:53.871]  Well, I got rights.
[01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:55.212]  My rights ain't been taken.
[01:13:57.273 --> 01:13:59.095]  Well, they're being taken, they're being dismantled.
[01:13:59.115 --> 01:14:00.076]  Do you know your rights?
[01:14:00.176 --> 01:14:00.957]  No, you don't know them.
[01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:05.502]  So I'm not some arrogant person up here pontificating.
[01:14:05.622 --> 01:14:06.303]  I'm scared.
[01:14:07.124 --> 01:14:08.205]  I'm really freaked out.
[01:14:09.326 --> 01:14:15.853]  Because we have a government engaging in every telltale sign, every key indicator, every signature, every wavelength.
[01:14:16.531 --> 01:14:22.316]  All the modus operandi, the classic MO of really scary tyrants.
[01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:27.181]  I don't mean the type of tyrant that's just a dictator and steals from people and is a little bit corrupt.
[01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:30.063]  I mean, I'm talking about mechanized extermination.
[01:14:30.103 --> 01:14:32.385]  I'm talking about real slave pit type stuff.
[01:14:32.705 --> 01:14:34.847]  I'm talking about the worst stuff in history we've seen.
[01:14:35.107 --> 01:14:40.292]  The exact same thing manifesting with a high-tech overlay grid merged with it.
[01:14:40.672 --> 01:14:43.435]  And I see the general public, man, they're in la-la land.
[01:14:43.955 --> 01:14:49.558]  Driving around smiling, listening to the rock and roll music, or going to their church.
[01:14:49.598 --> 01:14:51.278]  You know, the Lord's coming soon.
[01:14:51.338 --> 01:14:54.000]  Thank God they're trying to microchip us.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.481]  Thank God all these Latin American presidents are trying to make their people take them.
[01:14:58.201 --> 01:14:59.962]  Oh, I'm glad things are getting bad.
[01:15:00.002 --> 01:15:01.623]  It means I'll be out of here soon.
[01:15:02.763 --> 01:15:06.125]  You're not a real Christian, folks, if you don't have a burning desire to warn other people.
[01:15:06.664 --> 01:15:09.006]  You don't have a burning desire to try to fight this evil.
[01:15:09.407 --> 01:15:11.549]  I mean, your discernment's gone.
[01:15:11.609 --> 01:15:12.089]  You're gone.
[01:15:12.109 --> 01:15:13.591]  You're not going where you think you're going.
[01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:14.992]  That freaks me out.
[01:15:16.654 --> 01:15:17.715]  That scares me.
[01:15:18.255 --> 01:15:22.639]  It's just... Neocon talk radio.
[01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:26.143]  Fake conservative talk radio.
[01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:40.272]  Covers up for all the Bush's spending, and his gun control, and his doubling the size of every major federal agency, and all the hars, and doubling the money for Health and Human Services, and the CPS, and just everything evil he's doing.
[01:15:40.312 --> 01:15:41.472]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:15:42.473 --> 01:15:44.313]  It's all off the Richter scale.
[01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:45.693]  I'm shocked.
[01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:46.913]  I'm taken aback.
[01:15:47.633 --> 01:15:50.494]  I mean, I can't believe how they're just doing it all out in the open.
[01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:52.374]  Yeah, the NSA's spying on you.
[01:15:52.674 --> 01:15:56.615]  Fourth Amendment says we're allowed to spy without warrants, when it says the exact opposite.
[01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:59.817]  Well, people don't know how many continents there are.
[01:15:59.837 --> 01:16:03.499]  They're certainly not going to know what the first ten amendments are.
[01:16:03.519 --> 01:16:05.521]  And they're not going to know what the fourth amendment is.
[01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:08.163]  Or they think they know because the TV tells them.
[01:16:08.623 --> 01:16:11.445]  The fourth amendment means you have the right to be spied on for your safety.
[01:16:11.825 --> 01:16:12.526]  That's what they're saying.
[01:16:12.826 --> 01:16:15.648]  Oh, I have my right to be spied on, Mr. Jones!
[01:16:15.848 --> 01:16:16.589]  Shut up!
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:32.685]  I mean, I read these articles in the Financial Papers, Wall Street Journal today, everybody's celebrating, oh, the Dow's broken the record, oh, 11,600 and something, it's back, the economy's back, oh.
[01:16:33.525 --> 01:16:33.945]  No.
[01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:38.327]  In mid-2000, the economy crashed, we had a deep recession.
[01:16:39.955 --> 01:16:47.801]  We would have had a depression, which would have been milder compared to what it's going to be, but like a heroin addict who gets addicted, they just took even more instead of going through withdrawals.
[01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:52.904]  And the Federal Reserve doubled the money in the next five to six years.
[01:16:53.184 --> 01:16:53.605]  Doubled it.
[01:16:54.045 --> 01:16:56.827]  Now Bernanke's in there, he's saying he's going to double that in two.
[01:16:58.288 --> 01:16:59.529]  The dollar's imploding.
[01:17:00.029 --> 01:17:01.650]  And of course the stock market's at $11,000.
[01:17:04.984 --> 01:17:06.266]  Of course it is!
[01:17:08.468 --> 01:17:12.733]  If you've doubled the money supply, that means the stock market's at 6,000-something.
[01:17:13.654 --> 01:17:17.359]  I know I keep saying that, but I mean, come on, people!
[01:17:18.363 --> 01:17:18.844]  Okay?
[01:17:19.084 --> 01:17:20.965]  You don't know how many continents there are.
[01:17:21.366 --> 01:17:22.387]  Basic stuff like that.
[01:17:22.427 --> 01:17:24.028]  You don't know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[01:17:24.409 --> 01:17:26.070]  You don't know what the Tenth Amendment is.
[01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:28.252]  You don't even know what the whole First Amendment is.
[01:17:28.672 --> 01:17:29.713]  Most people think they do.
[01:17:30.754 --> 01:17:36.039]  And I'm talking about the general public listening, not our long-time listeners who are smarter than I am, or more informed on this issue than I am.
[01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:44.006]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks, when you don't even know the dollars tanked, and you don't even know they're printing money like Germany was before the crash.
[01:17:45.811 --> 01:17:48.294]  I mean, I'm upset about this, and it's going to be painful.
[01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:51.658]  There's going to be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.
[01:17:52.358 --> 01:17:56.523]  You're going to be so freaked out, and you're going to go right to the very government that's going to engineer it all.
[01:17:56.803 --> 01:17:58.425]  They're going to have make-work programs.
[01:17:58.445 --> 01:18:01.329]  It's going to be tattletale squads, set of building dams.
[01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:08.000]  Government buildings, you're going to be building FEMA camps, and you're going to be tattling on neighbors.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:08.940]  They've openly announced it.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:20.724]  Our whole economy is going to shift into this hellish thing, and to do anything, you know, to make $20,000 a year when it's worth $10,000 a year, and to stomp around in some uniform, that's all you'll have is your dumb uniform, you're going to do it!
[01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:24.405]  You're going to help kill this country for the very people that did this to us!
[01:18:27.205 --> 01:18:33.227]  I mean, that's the sick thing about the New World Order, is they do it to you, and then you thank them while they do it as your savior.
[01:18:33.837 --> 01:18:37.000]  They blow up buildings right in front of you.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.866]  They got declassified documents saying they carry out terror attacks.
[01:18:42.506 --> 01:18:48.032]  And it's like talking to a bunch of... Well, a bunch of ignorant savages are smarter than you.
[01:18:48.052 --> 01:18:50.795]  I mean, you people are as dumb as dirt!
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:19:02.288]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:19:02.548 --> 01:19:13.778]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:19:14.118 --> 01:19:19.823]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:19:20.063 --> 01:19:26.709]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:33.755]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:19:34.015 --> 01:19:35.777]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[01:19:36.057 --> 01:19:38.099]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[01:19:51.716 --> 01:19:52.157]  Gold.
[01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:53.798]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:54.058 --> 01:20:00.124]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:00.324 --> 01:20:04.148]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:06.390]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:08.732]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:08.872 --> 01:20:15.759]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:20:15.959 --> 01:20:16.659]  We're good to go.
[01:20:38.148 --> 01:20:38.388]  I'm good.
[01:20:52.037 --> 01:20:54.519]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.079 --> 01:21:02.162]  Did you know that Bible Prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the Communist world in the last days?
[01:21:03.023 --> 01:21:08.666]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the Western world of Christianity?
[01:21:09.366 --> 01:21:12.788]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible Prophecy.
[01:21:13.489 --> 01:21:14.070]  We're good to go.

[01:21:55.974 --> 01:21:57.775]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:58.896 --> 01:22:06.783]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:09.646]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Inc.'

[01:22:59.334 --> 01:23:02.995]  Let's move quick.
[01:23:03.115 --> 01:23:04.755]  Keith in New Jersey.
[01:23:05.035 --> 01:23:05.655]  You're on the air.
[01:23:05.695 --> 01:23:06.376]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:23:06.736 --> 01:23:07.936]  Yo, hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:23:08.336 --> 01:23:11.356]  Yo, um, I realized you were talking about you were making a new film.
[01:23:11.376 --> 01:23:12.657]  You don't even have a title for it.
[01:23:13.157 --> 01:23:14.257]  I have a couple suggestions.
[01:23:14.897 --> 01:23:21.738]  The first one is government, government, the ultimate inside job, or just inside jobs of the government.
[01:23:22.839 --> 01:23:24.699]  Inside jobs of the government?
[01:23:24.859 --> 01:23:25.019]  Yes.
[01:23:26.357 --> 01:23:29.921]  Or terrorism, an inside job, something like that.
[01:23:30.181 --> 01:23:30.842]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:47.418]  Another quick point, if you have enough time, is believe it or not, the hip-hop community, at least the underground parts of it, are actually aware and awake to this 9-11 and inside jobs, and the CIA being responsible for distributing drugs in America.
[01:23:47.899 --> 01:23:50.161]  I know you were talking about the prison industrial complex,
[01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:56.626]  No, I know a lot of the underground hip-hop, the stuff that doesn't get played on stations or picked up by MTV, that's some of the best out there.
[01:23:56.646 --> 01:24:05.768]  I mean, I can't listen to the mainstream hip-hop, but you listen to a lot of the alternative, Paris and others, Immortal Technique, and it's all about 9-11 being an inside job, you name it.
[01:24:06.368 --> 01:24:13.310]  I'm remote-conscious, to name a few ones, and actually one of them, who's mainstream, actually spoke about this in a quick blurb.
[01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:15.130]  I don't know if you ever heard of Jadakiss from The Rocks?
[01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:18.091]  He actually had a song out there that was pretty popular.
[01:24:18.111 --> 01:24:18.612]  It was called Live.
[01:24:18.652 --> 01:24:19.953]  Yeah, Bush brought down the towers.
[01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:20.613]  That's the one.
[01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:29.839]  And then there's also, if you look at some of the music that Eminem's put out, he also did a music video with Guerrilla News Network.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.523]  Oh, you're talking about the one that got censored and they changed the ending to vote instead of Bush being impeached?
[01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:36.163]  Yes.
[01:24:38.565 --> 01:24:43.668]  Oh, another thing is I'm a longtime listener and I've been trying to do my part on MySpace, on Facebook.
[01:24:43.909 --> 01:24:45.190]  I've actually started up
[01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:48.194]  9-11 Truth Movement on Facebook.
[01:24:48.774 --> 01:24:53.819]  All you've got to do is go to NJIT and just do a search on 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:01.806]  And actually, I also put up a post on where you can view Loose Change First and Second Edition on video.google.com.
[01:25:02.367 --> 01:25:03.948]  Oh yeah, thank you so much for the call.
[01:25:03.988 --> 01:25:04.709]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:05.569 --> 01:25:08.312]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:25:08.672 --> 01:25:11.134]  Let's talk to Travis in Ohio.
[01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:11.535]  Welcome.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:12.980]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.001]  I'm a huge fan.
[01:25:14.661 --> 01:25:16.142]  It's a real honor to actually talk to you.
[01:25:16.182 --> 01:25:16.942]  Honor to talk to you.
[01:25:17.002 --> 01:25:17.542]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:17.762 --> 01:25:21.924]  Well, sir, actually, I want to say I'm in Kentucky, but I'm right across the river.
[01:25:22.004 --> 01:25:29.508]  But yeah, George Bush will be speaking up here at Northern Kentucky University on the 19th of this month.
[01:25:29.828 --> 01:25:33.389]  And I just wanted to try to get the word out for anybody in this area who doesn't know about it.
[01:25:33.909 --> 01:25:35.210]  There will be a few protests.
[01:25:35.876 --> 01:25:46.696]  Not many though, and most of the people I've talked to through the campus organizations, all the Democrats are like, no, we don't want any crazy people up here talking crazy stuff and all that sort of crap.
[01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:48.299]  Just try to keep it...
[01:25:48.985 --> 01:25:50.465]  On the issues, as they would say.
[01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:59.087]  Yeah, the left gatekeepers who work for Hillary Clinton and others, trying to minimize and control any movement against Lord Bush, who's their boss.
[01:25:59.547 --> 01:26:04.728]  I've been arguing about Hillary for the past year, that this is who's going to be coming.
[01:26:05.148 --> 01:26:07.008]  Everybody's like, well, she'll do alright.
[01:26:07.048 --> 01:26:07.688]  She'll be good.
[01:26:07.748 --> 01:26:08.408]  She'll be alright.
[01:26:08.428 --> 01:26:08.908]  She'll be good.
[01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:11.009]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:11.389 --> 01:26:12.849]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:12.909 --> 01:26:17.750]  She's even more pro-war than George Bush, and the neocons now are starting to love her.
[01:26:18.655 --> 01:26:19.155]  That's right.
[01:26:20.055 --> 01:26:21.396]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:26:21.436 --> 01:26:23.576]  Let's talk to Phil in Maryland.
[01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:24.236]  You're on the air.
[01:26:24.776 --> 01:26:26.717]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:26.817 --> 01:26:28.537]  You bet.
[01:26:29.837 --> 01:26:33.938]  Through doing research on the internet, something unrelated woke up to all this.
[01:26:34.518 --> 01:26:41.019]  It's been less than a year, actually, and I have been just a voracious reader of trying to inform myself.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.420]  Well, that's a sure sign of being with Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:44.831 --> 01:26:45.391]  Yeah, right.
[01:26:46.012 --> 01:26:59.475]  I have in-laws in Houston and I just, you know, sent them the scanned images of the Texas, whatever it is, if you wear Levi jeans and they're slowly waking up.
[01:26:59.575 --> 01:27:04.836]  Oh yeah, the terror handbook saying that if you're a land rights activist or wear Levi's, you're a terrorist.
[01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:09.638]  Listen, my brother is a general aviation pilot and back in 2000 and 2002,
[01:27:12.116 --> 01:27:17.800]  We fly, you know, down to Florida to go fishing or something, and I turn my cell phone on and it's playing.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:22.063]  We were at about, you know, in a general aviation Cessna, you can't go above, say, 8.
[01:27:22.523 --> 01:27:26.646]  And if you don't have a compressed cabin above 10,000, you're supposed to be on oxygen.
[01:27:27.386 --> 01:27:32.930]  So even at, say, I think we were like maybe 5,500 feet, you know, to get some smooth air.
[01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.932]  And pilots are knowledgeable about
[01:27:37.253 --> 01:27:42.755]  FM frequencies, AM frequencies, they fly to a radio beacon at night with visual flares.
[01:27:42.775 --> 01:27:44.056]  I understand, yes.
[01:27:44.156 --> 01:27:57.520]  So these commercial pilots, they understand that cell phones don't work in a steel tube at 30,000 feet, and I was talking to my brother, who's a little skeptical about this, and I said, let's just say his name is Joe, and our last name is Smith.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:05.263]  I said to my brother, Joe, I said, Joe, when's the last time you called Mom and said, Hi Mom, this is Joe Smith, using your last name?
[01:28:06.431 --> 01:28:07.812]  Which is, which is what is going on.
[01:28:07.832 --> 01:28:08.632]  Oh yeah, the calls.
[01:28:09.172 --> 01:28:11.453]  Hello, this is Joe Smith, your son.
[01:28:11.513 --> 01:28:12.474]  The terrorists have me.
[01:28:12.494 --> 01:28:13.074]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:13.194 --> 01:28:15.255]  And they're calling from 30,000 feet.
[01:28:15.675 --> 01:28:15.895]  Yeah.
[01:28:16.255 --> 01:28:17.596]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:28:17.616 --> 01:28:18.316]  You know, come on.
[01:28:18.636 --> 01:28:22.998]  Now, Alex, last night ABC aired the bird flu movie and I watched most of it.
[01:28:23.578 --> 01:28:25.699]  But you didn't bring that up for this.
[01:28:25.719 --> 01:28:26.259]  Well, stay there.
[01:28:26.299 --> 01:28:26.980]  I didn't see it.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:29.421]  So give us your take on it real quick.
[01:28:29.441 --> 01:28:32.502]  Then we'll go right to Aaron Zellman, JPFO director.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.802]  With the update on the Second Amendment.
[01:28:34.822 --> 01:28:35.944]  Because we're evil liberals.
[01:28:35.984 --> 01:28:37.346]  We're pro-gun, anti-Hillary.
[01:28:37.786 --> 01:28:38.467]  You gotta get ready.
[01:28:38.627 --> 01:28:39.689]  We're now the liberals.
[01:28:42.773 --> 01:28:43.193]  March.
[01:28:43.634 --> 01:28:45.256]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.276 --> 01:28:48.881]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:54.291]  Come on, Bill.
[01:28:54.511 --> 01:28:56.332]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[01:28:56.533 --> 01:28:59.675]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:29:00.015 --> 01:29:00.575]  What did you do?
[01:29:00.695 --> 01:29:01.516]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:29:01.616 --> 01:29:02.336]  No, John.
[01:29:02.397 --> 01:29:03.577]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:29:03.858 --> 01:29:09.381]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:09.681 --> 01:29:15.926]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:16.266 --> 01:29:18.487]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:18.748 --> 01:29:20.069]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.850]  Whoa!
[01:29:23.211 --> 01:29:24.391]  What was that website again?
[01:29:24.491 --> 01:29:27.973]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:28.294 --> 01:29:29.374]  Now write this down, John.
[01:29:29.534 --> 01:29:33.837]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:29:33.977 --> 01:29:34.577]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:29:34.838 --> 01:29:36.038]  I'm going there right now.
[01:29:36.439 --> 01:29:37.119]  Check, please.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.341]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:29:40.821 --> 01:29:41.422]  Sure, John.
[01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:46.024]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:46.305 --> 01:29:47.986]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:29:48.166 --> 01:29:48.406]  Deal.
[01:29:49.787 --> 01:29:52.808]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:53.128 --> 01:29:58.049]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:29:58.309 --> 01:30:02.670]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:11.872]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:12.072 --> 01:30:15.693]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:15.993 --> 01:30:21.022]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:21.323 --> 01:30:28.054]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:28.535 --> 01:30:29.076]  What about you?
[01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:35.173]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:50.037 --> 01:30:56.900]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:30:57.041 --> 01:31:09.967]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:31:10.147 --> 01:31:11.928]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:31:12.108 --> 01:31:15.590]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:19.652]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:31:19.912 --> 01:31:24.874]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:31:25.134 --> 01:31:26.855]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:31.077]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:31:31.337 --> 01:31:33.199]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:38.006]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.

[01:31:39.768 --> 01:31:40.309]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[01:31:58.443 --> 01:31:59.404]  Alright, my friends.
[01:32:00.164 --> 01:32:01.985]  Cutting into that rebroadcast now.
[01:32:02.045 --> 01:32:02.586]  We're live.
[01:32:02.626 --> 01:32:05.187]  It's Monday, the 15th day of May, 2006.
[01:32:05.748 --> 01:32:08.009]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:08.449 --> 01:32:17.815]  If you were listening towards the end of the first hour, I called in via cell phone because, believe me, I would miss an important broadcast day like this for almost anything, but...
[01:32:18.607 --> 01:32:21.248]  I'm going to get into that news, what brought me back in today.
[01:32:21.268 --> 01:32:40.036]  I got a call early this morning that my best friend from childhood, who lives here in Austin, Texas, we both grew up in Dallas, but he and his family lived down here in Austin, had gotten real sick yesterday and he went to the hospital and is going to die any minute, they're saying.
[01:32:41.376 --> 01:32:45.938]  When I got there, they had already resuscitated him, he'd already died once.
[01:32:46.607 --> 01:32:56.951]  And I was actually able to talk to him and he was conscious and nodding yes, shaking his head no, not asking questions, but then his blood pressure dropped again.
[01:32:56.991 --> 01:32:59.352]  He's got total organ failure.
[01:33:00.272 --> 01:33:05.414]  It's really a mystery because he wasn't a very big drinker, didn't use drugs.
[01:33:06.774 --> 01:33:13.517]  Who knows where it is nowadays that causes things like this to happen no more once they
[01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:26.435]  Once they get tests back, but it reminds us all how transitory, how quick life goes by and how precious it is every day above ground is a good day.
[01:33:26.695 --> 01:33:37.300]  And when we die, it's really what we've done in our lives, what we've stood up for, the good things we've done, the children we've reared, the ideas we put forward, the stands we've taken.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:42.522]  And my good friend, Ryan Baxter, a great guy who I've known since I was two years old,
[01:33:43.399 --> 01:33:44.720]  He's 33 years old.
[01:33:45.321 --> 01:33:49.285]  For all intents and purposes, the doctors are saying there's no way.
[01:33:49.585 --> 01:33:51.667]  They've got him on a ventilator.
[01:33:54.069 --> 01:33:54.730]  It's interesting.
[01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:56.151]  We did that show Friday.
[01:33:56.171 --> 01:34:07.582]  Again, I say I don't even believe in it because I don't get into stuff like that, but we had the three-star general on, Stubblebine, who headed up the Army's program for remote viewing.
[01:34:08.661 --> 01:34:18.367]  And I talked about how most people have the experience of you think about your grandmother, you worry about your grandmother, you haven't called her in two months, and you call, you know, your daughter and she's just died.
[01:34:18.387 --> 01:34:23.370]  And yesterday I spent half the day with my family.
[01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:25.331]  I try to squeeze that in.
[01:34:25.711 --> 01:34:29.433]  I've been finishing this new film, Terror Storm.
[01:34:29.453 --> 01:34:30.854]  I think that's going to be the title.
[01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:33.195]  I came up with that in-house here.
[01:34:33.235 --> 01:34:36.037]  I appreciate all the listeners that submitted all their great ideas as well.
[01:34:37.731 --> 01:34:39.032]  And it was about 8 o'clock at night.
[01:34:39.072 --> 01:34:41.853]  I'd gotten back up here and I was working on the film with Rob.
[01:34:42.514 --> 01:34:43.815]  And I just kept thinking about Ryan.
[01:34:43.855 --> 01:34:45.535]  I said, you know, I don't have his number here at the office.
[01:34:45.556 --> 01:34:46.556]  I just need to call him.
[01:34:46.576 --> 01:34:50.518]  He'd been calling me the last few months and I'd been so busy I hadn't been calling him back.
[01:34:50.538 --> 01:34:53.400]  And I just kept thinking about him.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.441]  And it's just really weird.
[01:34:55.461 --> 01:34:58.543]  And then I woke up this morning, well actually in the middle of the night.
[01:34:59.263 --> 01:35:02.845]  I'd gone to bed about 2.30 and I woke up about 4 o'clock and I rarely wake up.
[01:35:03.285 --> 01:35:03.646]  And I was
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:06.380]  I had a really weird dream.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.361]  I'm not going to go into it.
[01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.941]  But the point is, there's a lot of weird stuff going on in the world.
[01:35:10.861 --> 01:35:15.802]  And what we see, what we think reality is, is only the surface of things.
[01:35:15.862 --> 01:35:17.383]  And I know he's going to a better place.
[01:35:18.203 --> 01:35:20.864]  I tell you, it was one of the most poignant things I've ever seen.
[01:35:21.964 --> 01:35:29.066]  When I first got there about 8.30 in the morning, he died just about an hour before.
[01:35:29.106 --> 01:35:31.046]  And they, again, resuscitated him.
[01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:37.794]  And they'd hopped him up on a bunch of drugs that would keep his blood pressure up while he was on the ventilator.
[01:35:38.195 --> 01:35:51.063]  And imagine, you're conscious, you're awake, you know you're dying, you hear doctors around you talking about how you're going to die, and he's looking around him, he's clearly responding, he's squeezing your hand, you know, you say, do you hear me?
[01:35:51.083 --> 01:35:52.404]  And he squeezes your hand real hard.
[01:35:53.025 --> 01:35:59.009]  And this real nice black lady, this chaplain comes in, because the family's Christian,
[01:36:00.217 --> 01:36:06.378]  And they ask her to pray with him and to basically read him the last rites.
[01:36:07.319 --> 01:36:09.879]  And she's talking to him about the Holy Spirit and about Jesus Christ.
[01:36:10.459 --> 01:36:13.420]  And he did not want to hear that he's going to die.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.340]  And barring a miracle, he is.
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:16.381]  He may even be dead right now.
[01:36:19.521 --> 01:36:21.802]  So to make a long story short, she starts
[01:36:22.757 --> 01:36:29.839]  And again, it wasn't that he was upset, because I know he's a Christian, about hearing about Jesus and heaven and accepting Jesus and all of that.
[01:36:30.299 --> 01:36:31.839]  It was that he didn't want to hear he was going to die.
[01:36:31.859 --> 01:36:32.919]  And he started trying to get up.
[01:36:32.939 --> 01:36:33.759]  They had him restrained.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.560]  Get up out of the bed.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.861]  And he started, basically starting to flail a little bit.
[01:36:40.981 --> 01:36:42.441]  And he was really fighting.
[01:36:42.461 --> 01:36:44.542]  And I said, so you want to hang on?
[01:36:44.582 --> 01:36:45.122]  You want to fight?
[01:36:45.162 --> 01:36:47.202]  You want to be resuscitated again if you die again?
[01:36:47.562 --> 01:36:49.723]  He's like nodding his head and squeezing my hand.
[01:36:50.518 --> 01:36:52.099]  And then his blood pressure dropped again.
[01:36:52.159 --> 01:37:00.185]  His pupils went from, you know, small in that brightly lit room to just totally, I guess they call it like shark eyes, just where it's black.
[01:37:00.786 --> 01:37:07.030]  So he's almost, I guess we've got his brainwaves like in a coma right now.
[01:37:07.931 --> 01:37:11.274]  And again, it's hard to come into a radio show when you're best friend.
[01:37:12.795 --> 01:37:14.196]  And I wouldn't say we've grown apart.
[01:37:14.216 --> 01:37:15.337]  It's just I don't have a lot of friends.
[01:37:15.357 --> 01:37:17.218]  All I do is work and then spend time with my family.
[01:37:18.298 --> 01:37:43.991]  I mean, I remember being five years old, going fishing with him, our families would go down to the coast together, building sandcastles, I remember when we grew up, across the street from each other in Dallas, and playing Army in the woods, and Batman and Robin running around on our Hot Wheels, and all of that, and being in Big Bend, and one time Ryan went running and jumped off a rock about five feet down, yelling Spider-Man right on top of a giant cactus.
[01:37:44.551 --> 01:37:45.472]  That was something else.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:54.201]  But here, now today, for ever gone, that's really how it works.
[01:37:54.361 --> 01:37:55.682]  And I want everybody to remember that.
[01:37:56.222 --> 01:38:05.524]  For all your cars, and your money, and acting cool, and your fake George Bush stickers, or your stupid Bill Clinton stickers, none of that's going to mean anything in the end.
[01:38:05.544 --> 01:38:16.467]  I mean, what matters is knowing the truth, and being involved, and standing up for what's good, and standing up against evil, and knowing the truth about the world, and raising strong families.
[01:38:18.087 --> 01:38:19.347]  I could die today and I'd be happy.
[01:38:19.387 --> 01:38:20.448]  I'd be happy with my life.
[01:38:20.548 --> 01:38:21.548]  I'd be proud of my life.
[01:38:21.968 --> 01:38:23.269]  There's a lot of work I haven't done.
[01:38:23.289 --> 01:38:24.229]  A lot of work I want to do.
[01:38:24.289 --> 01:38:24.949]  I love life.
[01:38:25.689 --> 01:38:30.691]  But I could die right now and know I've lived a fulfilled life and I'm at peace with that.
[01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:33.092]  Obviously, I have a very dangerous job and I know that.
[01:38:33.732 --> 01:38:46.996]  But at the same time, when somebody you know and love is dying, you get really sad but at the same time it makes you happy that you're still alive and you can walk outside on a beautiful day and see the pretty trees and the blue sky and hear the birds singing.
[01:38:47.939 --> 01:38:50.922]  But at the same time, you have a little bit of guilt that, you know, I'm alive.
[01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:52.022]  I'm vibrant.
[01:38:52.142 --> 01:38:53.824]  I'm virile.
[01:38:54.604 --> 01:38:55.345]  I'm here.
[01:38:55.425 --> 01:38:56.206]  I'm potent.
[01:38:57.266 --> 01:38:58.868]  I'm hard-charging through life.
[01:38:59.628 --> 01:39:07.174]  And it just really makes you sad for those out there that you know who the door of life is closing on them.
[01:39:09.075 --> 01:39:13.679]  But I'm not trying to do a, you know, pre-eulogy here.
[01:39:13.839 --> 01:39:14.339]  It's just
[01:39:16.391 --> 01:39:31.742]  A lot of people I've known, last year, I went to like four funerals last year, and I guess this year is off to a, I guess we're in the middle of the year now, it's off to a sad start as well, but there's so much life around us, and that's part of God's plan, part of the cycle.
[01:39:32.683 --> 01:39:38.187]  When somebody's taken at a young age, it makes it that much harder to deal with.
[01:39:38.827 --> 01:39:45.472]  Sitting here, there's also the mystery of why his organs are basically
[01:39:46.843 --> 01:39:54.445]  Liquefying, and basically the drugs they've got him on are just keeping his core alive.
[01:39:55.765 --> 01:39:58.786]  I'm getting off into side issues, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:59.386 --> 01:40:10.548]  It's hard to cover the news when stuff like this is going on, but let me shift into the news, why I'm here, why I left the hospital and came in here, because this must be discussed, it must be talked about.
[01:40:12.452 --> 01:40:15.994]  George Bush's approval rating has hit 29 percent.
[01:40:16.154 --> 01:40:19.416]  Conservatives will accept his anti-gun stance.
[01:40:19.436 --> 01:40:24.819]  They will accept his spending more than all presidents before him combined stance.
[01:40:25.639 --> 01:40:27.920]  They like the fact that he attacked Iraq.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.301]  They think that's macho and tough.
[01:40:30.021 --> 01:40:31.022]  They think that's manly.
[01:40:31.062 --> 01:40:32.062]  They think that's American.
[01:40:32.122 --> 01:40:32.563]  It's not.
[01:40:34.323 --> 01:40:40.867]  But they will not put up with the open borders and the illegal aliens running around saying this is Oslon, this is Mexico.
[01:40:43.061 --> 01:40:54.230]  And what Bush is doing is a microcosm of what Governor Rick Perry has done, what the Governor of New Mexico has done, and even what Arnold has talked about doing, and that's smoke and mirrors.
[01:40:55.451 --> 01:41:04.198]  The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who's Chief of Texas-Mexico Affairs, is a Mexican citizen and a registered lobbyist of the government of Mexico.
[01:41:05.639 --> 01:41:11.444]  That is patently illegal in my view, and I've looked at some of the laws, but these people don't seem to care.
[01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:25.352]  And it was his border advisor, when Perry's numbers started sliding over the border issue massively, just a few months ago, as he goes into this election that's coming up, this gubernatorial election, Rick Perry said, I'm going to put troops on the border!
[01:41:25.732 --> 01:41:39.035]  And big press conferences, George Bush came down here to Texas, they went down on the South Texas border, it's a huge war zone, state departments listed it more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel, three travel advisories last year, one advisory this year not to go there,
[01:41:40.015 --> 01:41:41.916]  And you know the facts of what's happened.
[01:41:42.496 --> 01:41:46.937]  Car bombings, machine gunnings, death, mass kidnappings, cops being killed, citizens being killed.
[01:41:47.298 --> 01:41:47.958]  It's unbelievable.
[01:41:47.978 --> 01:41:52.720]  You talk about terrorist attacks, a war zone, South Texas is it, in the border region.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:42:05.044]  And so Rick Perry, then you look at the details of what he did, the governor, and it was 100 police and state guard and national guard mixed with border patrol
[01:42:06.519 --> 01:42:07.960]  100 over the next year.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:17.623]  And you average it out, it's about 12 people in one month rotations throughout the next, or excuse me, that'd be less.
[01:42:17.703 --> 01:42:22.984]  It's 8 people each month through the next 12 months.
[01:42:23.024 --> 01:42:28.426]  So Perry in a speech said 100, but then you broke it down, it was each month.
[01:42:31.190 --> 01:42:32.991]  And that's exactly what Bush is doing.
[01:42:33.571 --> 01:42:40.534]  Bush is binding and tying like a... like railway cars connected to an engine on the train track.
[01:42:40.574 --> 01:42:44.376]  And the engine is amnesty that he calls the Guest Worker Program.
[01:42:44.396 --> 01:42:46.116]  That'll be the biggest amnesty in U.S.
[01:42:46.617 --> 01:42:51.318]  history of conservatively, and it's conservative, 25 million illegal aliens.
[01:42:52.459 --> 01:42:53.619]  Much higher than 14 million.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.700]  We have the federal numbers.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:56.401]  They're cooking the numbers when you hear 14.
[01:42:58.109 --> 01:43:04.734]  That's just what the census picked up, but the welfare bureaus have got the number of 24 million and it's rapidly climbing by 3 million a year.
[01:43:04.754 --> 01:43:14.421]  2 million illegal, 1 million legal, and then of course the number should be 4 million, but 1 million do go back each year, but it's a total increase of 3 million.
[01:43:14.881 --> 01:43:22.507]  And so what they've done is they have Bush's amnesty plan that in two state of the unions he's told this is not an amnesty, but it's for six years, I mean what do you call this?
[01:43:23.167 --> 01:43:26.350]  For six years anyone who's here or anyone who can get here
[01:43:27.305 --> 01:43:35.638]  is instantly legalized, gets green card status, and is put in the pike to get their citizenship within four years.
[01:43:36.299 --> 01:43:39.664]  So anyone who gets here for the next six years will be instantly legalized.
[01:43:40.891 --> 01:43:44.092]  So that's even more, over and above the 25 million that are currently here.
[01:43:44.512 --> 01:43:49.513]  It allows corporations to bring in unlimited unskilled and unlimited skilled.
[01:43:49.773 --> 01:43:55.694]  You thought, what is it, over 80% of the high-tech jobs in the last decade going overseas to India and China?
[01:43:55.714 --> 01:43:56.695]  You thought that was bad.
[01:43:56.735 --> 01:44:06.557]  That 20% will be displaced now by Indians and Chinese and other Eastern Europeans, but predominantly Indians, being brought into the U.S.
[01:44:08.317 --> 01:44:15.058]  And then of course unlimited skilled workers, unlimited unskilled, and the corporations can literally just bust the Latin Americans in.
[01:44:15.458 --> 01:44:18.619]  It will instantly end, quote, the illegal alien problem.
[01:44:18.679 --> 01:44:29.441]  Yes, you're not going to see the illegal border crossers anymore because they will be totally legalized instantly and can instantly flood across the border totally unabated.
[01:44:31.302 --> 01:44:32.102]  And that is the plan.
[01:44:32.142 --> 01:44:33.122]  We've read the bill on air.
[01:44:33.162 --> 01:44:34.582]  We've had Tom Tancredo on.
[01:44:34.942 --> 01:44:36.363]  We've had Ron Paul about the bill.
[01:44:36.383 --> 01:44:37.983]  There's been hundreds of articles I've seen.
[01:44:38.729 --> 01:44:39.790]  I'm sure you've read many of them.
[01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:44.512]  We post them on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com to tell all this.
[01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:47.294]  And it's just in your face!
[01:44:48.555 --> 01:44:49.815]  They call it a guest worker program.
[01:44:49.855 --> 01:44:50.976]  It's a total and complete amnesty.
[01:44:51.036 --> 01:44:59.401]  And then they're going, just like Rick Perry did, when Rick Perry put a hundred people on the border, he didn't even in his speeches say it was to stop illegal aliens, what he calls migrants.
[01:44:59.421 --> 01:45:01.682]  He said, yes, the border's real dangerous and it's bad.
[01:45:01.742 --> 01:45:06.165]  We've got to control our borders and they'll be there fighting drugs and the coyotes and the crime.
[01:45:08.047 --> 01:45:09.408]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:45:10.369 --> 01:45:18.353]  And so the same model that New Mexico and Texas have engaged in, of putting state guard on the border, is what Bush is going to do with some paltry number.
[01:45:19.094 --> 01:45:31.882]  And he's already backtracking from the news announcements Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, where he's going to secure the border, to telling the Mexican government, don't worry, I'm just going to put a few thousand National Guard on the border to deal with the quote, crime.
[01:45:32.964 --> 01:45:43.031]  Meanwhile, of course, the Bush administration is really reporting every movement via the Border Patrol, taking up their precious scant resources to report to the Mexican government the location of all the Minutemen.
[01:45:43.551 --> 01:45:55.179]  So the Minutemen are vigilantes because they're reporting criminals coming across the border, but Bush tells the public to spy on their neighbors domestically here in the U.S., but then it's okay to have the Border Patrol spy on the Minutemen.
[01:45:57.506 --> 01:45:59.567]  So, here's the first spin out.
[01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:01.328]  Bush set to send guard to border.
[01:46:01.828 --> 01:46:03.068]  Assignment would be temporary.
[01:46:03.209 --> 01:46:04.949]  Critics cite strain on troops.
[01:46:05.730 --> 01:46:08.771]  And then they've got the illegal aliens are going to come out and protest Bush now.
[01:46:09.151 --> 01:46:11.072]  And that will fool billions of Americans.
[01:46:11.092 --> 01:46:12.913]  They'll say, well, Bush has finally gotten tough.
[01:46:14.333 --> 01:46:14.634]  He is
[01:46:16.095 --> 01:46:22.756]  We've got the illegal aliens protesting him now, and the illegal alien protests are wildly unpopular, right at ninety percent.
[01:46:23.296 --> 01:46:27.557]  It was in the high eighties before the protest that backfired on Rob Allen and Co.
[01:46:27.577 --> 01:46:30.798]  that Bush and Fox hired the PR firm to stage all this.
[01:46:30.838 --> 01:46:34.458]  They thought it would work, it blew up in their face, and they can't un-ring that bell.
[01:46:36.119 --> 01:46:43.020]  And so now Bush is in free fall with his poll numbers, so he's going to engage in this smoke and mirrors of how he's going to put troops on the borders,
[01:46:43.687 --> 01:46:44.748]  But he's attaching that.
[01:46:44.788 --> 01:46:45.769]  He's sending it to Congress.
[01:46:46.069 --> 01:46:59.239]  He's announcing legislation to add to the legislation he introduced two years ago through the Democrats, working with him as usual, and Republican leadership, to attach, hey, I'm going to put troops on the borders and this guest worker program.
[01:46:59.859 --> 01:47:01.380]  That'll fix the illegal alien problem.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.842]  So give me this and I'll give you that.
[01:47:06.184 --> 01:47:07.905]  And Bush did this too with the Second Amendment.
[01:47:07.925 --> 01:47:12.929]  Remember during the campaign he gave speeches about how he must defend the individual's right to the Second Amendment?
[01:47:13.777 --> 01:47:15.719]  Then people ask his lawyers, well, what's he mean by that?
[01:47:15.739 --> 01:47:16.860]  He goes, well, within the law.
[01:47:17.341 --> 01:47:21.745]  Meaning that the little laws or regulations they pass supersede the Second Amendment.
[01:47:21.885 --> 01:47:31.055]  And then he doubles the size of the BATF and starts changing regulations using regulatory measures instead of laws to attack the Second Amendment viciously.
[01:47:31.115 --> 01:47:33.557]  And we had Aaron Zellman on about that last week.
[01:47:35.928 --> 01:47:41.893]  And then I go in a gun shop and I'm told I'm a liar, George Bush, it wasn't for the assault of his van, why they heard his speech.
[01:47:42.393 --> 01:47:51.780]  Doesn't matter if he lobbied for it, pushed it, tried to reauthorize it, doesn't matter what he's really doing, it just feels good to suck your thumb like an idiot and be fooled and be conned.
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:54.742]  I don't know why so many people want to lie to themselves.
[01:47:55.182 --> 01:48:02.408]  Why so many people want to be conned, why you want to be stupid, why you want to believe frauds, why you think it's cute.
[01:48:03.323 --> 01:48:08.068]  I see these people with George Bush stickers all over their cars and sportsmen for Bush and all this.
[01:48:08.889 --> 01:48:10.490]  And I mean, you're being fooled.
[01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:11.171]  You're being conned.
[01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:16.276]  It's like you want, you know, timeshares that didn't exist or mining shares that didn't exist.
[01:48:16.316 --> 01:48:17.497]  I mean, you've been ripped off.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.562]  And you will not get out of the first phase.
[01:48:20.622 --> 01:48:23.044]  People always, when they get ripped off at first, are in denial.
[01:48:23.384 --> 01:48:24.505]  But you people have been in denial.
[01:48:24.765 --> 01:48:26.806]  It's the same thing when a Democrat's in office.
[01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:34.312]  The whole New World Order agenda will just continue on, and suddenly the Democrats will all be defending it, and Republicans will all be screaming bloody murder about it.
[01:48:35.192 --> 01:48:38.255]  Look, I scream bloody murder when Communist Chinese take over our bases.
[01:48:38.535 --> 01:48:40.737]  When Clinton's in, I scream bloody murder when they do it.
[01:48:41.017 --> 01:48:42.658]  When Bush is in, I don't change.
[01:48:43.659 --> 01:48:45.300]  This is not a radical broadcast.
[01:48:45.956 --> 01:48:46.256]  Okay?
[01:48:46.557 --> 01:48:47.637]  We just cover the facts.
[01:48:47.697 --> 01:49:00.346]  I'm sorry, the truth to some people sounds radical, but Bush is a sniveling puppet of the globalists that are breaking down the sovereignty of this country and foreclosing on it and consolidating it and looting it.
[01:49:02.868 --> 01:49:07.391]  And this morning, driving into the hospital to visit again my friend who's dying.
[01:49:08.452 --> 01:49:10.853]  He may already be dead, but folks should pray for him.
[01:49:10.873 --> 01:49:11.674]  I would ask you to do that.
[01:49:12.985 --> 01:49:17.567]  I knew if I tuned into Neocon Talk Radio, I'd hear that, man, this is great, Bush is really doing something.
[01:49:19.247 --> 01:49:20.828]  And they do this by creating a false debate.
[01:49:20.848 --> 01:49:27.030]  They had guests on who were saying, we're against this, we're immigrant rights groups, Bush is a fascist pig, basically.
[01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:28.871]  This will hurt our immigrants.
[01:49:29.791 --> 01:49:34.893]  And people see the Reconquistas attacking him and think, oh, he must be good.
[01:49:35.713 --> 01:49:37.113]  And they just fooled you again.
[01:49:37.133 --> 01:49:38.954]  And I just get so tired of it.
[01:49:39.354 --> 01:49:41.495]  I get so tired of the good cop, bad cop stuff.
[01:49:42.856 --> 01:49:44.076]  I just want to save this country.
[01:49:44.717 --> 01:49:49.498]  We'll come back in the morning to take your calls.
[01:49:51.278 --> 01:49:54.119]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[01:50:01.321 --> 01:50:08.043]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:08.363 --> 01:50:10.365]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:10.565 --> 01:50:13.407]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:13.507 --> 01:50:18.150]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:22.774]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:23.014 --> 01:50:30.239]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:51:03.705 --> 01:51:08.367]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:08.847 --> 01:51:15.570]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:27.715]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:51.783 --> 01:51:52.083]  I think so.
[01:52:07.128 --> 01:52:07.789]  We're good to go!
[01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:39.751]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:39.911 --> 01:52:45.874]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.597 --> 01:52:56.538]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:52:56.998 --> 01:52:59.740]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:53:06.112 --> 01:53:22.065]  You've got to really be taken back by the hubris, the arrogance of Bush and his handlers, his globalist crime syndicate controllers, that they get up there and propose total amnesty.
[01:53:22.085 --> 01:53:28.631]  They've been doing this for two years, more than two years now, as the way to fix illegal immigration.
[01:53:29.071 --> 01:53:31.053]  Well yeah, they'll just totally capitulate to it.
[01:53:31.633 --> 01:53:33.535]  We'll end the war, we'll surrender.
[01:53:34.845 --> 01:53:35.826]  Is the whole response.
[01:53:35.906 --> 01:53:37.488]  We'll strike our colors.
[01:53:37.528 --> 01:53:40.331]  We'll hoist down our flag and run up the white flag.
[01:53:41.393 --> 01:53:44.777]  And that he's going to be defended by the entire host of neocons.
[01:53:45.598 --> 01:53:46.078]  He's going to be.
[01:53:46.579 --> 01:53:47.380]  It's already happening.
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.601]  The lying.
[01:53:49.502 --> 01:53:50.443]  It's a new hoax.
[01:53:51.665 --> 01:53:52.366]  A new hoax.
[01:53:55.279 --> 01:53:59.763]  Bush is saying, don't worry, I'm only going to put them down there a few months, just pass my legislation.
[01:54:00.343 --> 01:54:18.057]  In the meantime, for amnesty, I mean, guest worker program, in the meantime, I'll put some troops on the border, and don't worry, we'll have lots of TV images of troops apprehending a few thousand illegal aliens on the Texas and New Mexico and Arizona and Southern California border.
[01:54:20.496 --> 01:54:22.518]  No, what they need to do is start going after the employers.
[01:54:22.538 --> 01:54:24.219]  And you're like, well, they did a few months ago.
[01:54:24.279 --> 01:54:26.681]  They arrested over a thousand illegal aliens.
[01:54:26.741 --> 01:54:27.682]  Twelve hundred total.
[01:54:28.123 --> 01:54:29.784]  About two hundred of those were employers, though.
[01:54:30.585 --> 01:54:32.106]  From one crate company.
[01:54:32.406 --> 01:54:33.607]  Why didn't they go after Walmart?
[01:54:33.627 --> 01:54:34.608]  Why didn't they go after Target?
[01:54:34.648 --> 01:54:36.690]  Why didn't they go after these auto plants?
[01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:40.813]  Why didn't they go after Cargill and Tyson Chicken and Tyson Packing?
[01:54:41.314 --> 01:54:41.874]  Oh, believe me.
[01:54:41.894 --> 01:54:43.816]  I mean, it's almost all illegal aliens there.
[01:54:44.502 --> 01:54:48.363]  In fact, those companies, some of them had paid leave for the illegal aliens back on May Day.
[01:54:48.423 --> 01:54:49.424]  Oh, you go ahead and leave.
[01:54:49.464 --> 01:54:50.124]  You go protest.
[01:54:50.144 --> 01:54:50.964]  We're all for you.
[01:54:51.004 --> 01:54:51.704]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:54:54.165 --> 01:54:55.065]  I mean, think about it.
[01:54:56.346 --> 01:55:07.209]  If they arrested 1,000 illegal aliens a day for 365 days, that would be less than 1% of the 25 million that are in this country.
[01:55:07.929 --> 01:55:09.850]  Or let's say there's only 14 million.
[01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:10.850]  That'd be less than 2%.
[01:55:10.890 --> 01:55:11.170]  It's a joke!
[01:55:13.837 --> 01:55:14.677]  It's a joke.
[01:55:14.697 --> 01:55:18.078]  Again, you've got a general public in major studies.
[01:55:18.098 --> 01:55:18.719]  They have every year.
[01:55:18.739 --> 01:55:20.059]  A new one just came out two weeks ago.
[01:55:20.559 --> 01:55:21.299]  We covered it here.
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.221]  Over two-thirds can't find places like Pakistan.
[01:55:25.261 --> 01:55:26.741]  A third can't find Iraq.
[01:55:27.221 --> 01:55:33.483]  In some cases, it's 90 plus percent can't find other major places like Nigeria, South Africa.
[01:55:34.484 --> 01:55:39.525]  And they've had major studies where upwards of 90 percent of high school seniors don't know who the vice president is.
[01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:41.666]  And adults aren't much different.
[01:55:42.481 --> 01:55:43.502]  I mean, the studies were 18 to 24.
[01:55:43.542 --> 01:55:48.806]  I mean, I talk to people who've got degrees, and they don't know which end is up.
[01:55:48.866 --> 01:55:50.348]  But they'll argue with you, though.
[01:55:51.769 --> 01:55:56.333]  They haven't read books, three or four books on Iraq's history, three or four books on Iran's history.
[01:55:56.353 --> 01:55:58.234]  They haven't read four or five books on the Iraq War.
[01:55:58.254 --> 01:56:01.697]  They haven't interviewed probably, I don't know, 50, 60 guests on the first Iraq War.
[01:56:02.137 --> 01:56:05.480]  Say, 150 guests or more on the second Gulf War.
[01:56:06.061 --> 01:56:08.463]  Top generals, congressmen, experts.
[01:56:09.668 --> 01:56:19.215]  People that have been there, journalists, they just, I watch Fox TV, I watch CNN, and everything is great, and George W. is good, and just shut up, Alex!
[01:56:20.336 --> 01:56:21.536]  Just shut up!
[01:56:24.038 --> 01:56:28.601]  Christine, Kerry, Skunk, Dave, Tim, we'll start your calls when we get into the next hour.
[01:56:29.262 --> 01:56:30.723]  I got a bunch of other news, too.
[01:56:30.743 --> 01:56:32.464]  This is out of the Australian, mainstream news.
[01:56:32.944 --> 01:56:36.467]  Building top floors closed after brain tumor alert from cell phone tower.
[01:56:37.379 --> 01:56:40.780]  This is really starting to break into the mainstream consciousness.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.340]  And there's a bunch of other news on Iran.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.001]  A ton of issues coming up in the third hour.
[01:56:47.861 --> 01:57:00.784]  Before I do that, I just want to briefly at the end of this hour tell you that the tickets are going fast to our huge 9-11 conference we're going to have with Professor Steven Jones and Professor Fetzer and other surprise guests, Webster Tarpley, myself.
[01:57:01.344 --> 01:57:03.705]  My new film will be debuted there, Terror Storm.
[01:57:04.654 --> 01:57:07.435]  Southern California, L.A., downtown Sheraton.
[01:57:08.456 --> 01:57:12.057]  And that's going to be the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:57:12.077 --> 01:57:16.759]  Get your tickets at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.680]  That's InfoWars.com.
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.041]  Don't wait or call to get your tickets.
[01:57:21.061 --> 01:57:21.521]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:21.561 --> 01:57:22.442]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:30.319 --> 01:57:34.463]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:34.483 --> 01:57:34.583]  Hello?
[01:57:34.603 --> 01:57:35.023]  Big Brother.
[01:57:35.163 --> 01:57:35.784]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:36.004 --> 01:57:37.746]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:37.786 --> 01:57:39.347]  You want answers?
[01:57:40.088 --> 01:57:44.492]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.111 --> 01:57:57.732]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.292 --> 01:58:02.414]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.476 --> 01:58:17.339]  President Bush sent a box publicly on the record, controlled the illegal alien movement through the PR firm Rob Allen & Co., orchestrated through Spanish-speaking media under their control.
[01:58:18.308 --> 01:58:22.470]  So they're going to have the illegal aliens protesting Bush's new total amnesty plan today.
[01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:26.392]  That way Americans will think that it's really a plan to control the border.
[01:58:26.793 --> 01:58:29.814]  Bush will stage some troops there for a few months and fool everybody.
[01:58:30.695 --> 01:58:31.675]  We'll get back into that.
[01:58:31.695 --> 01:58:32.836]  A lot of news on Iran.
[01:58:32.856 --> 01:58:35.277]  Some new news on cell phone danger to your brain.
[01:58:35.297 --> 01:58:37.698]  They've had to evacuate a building over this.
[01:58:38.159 --> 01:58:40.840]  Right now let's go to Christine in Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.240]  Welcome.
[01:58:42.881 --> 01:58:43.381]  Hi Alex.
[01:58:43.422 --> 01:58:43.902]  Can you hear me?
[01:58:44.082 --> 01:58:44.602]  Yes I can.
[01:58:45.663 --> 01:58:45.843]  Yeah.
[01:58:46.707 --> 01:58:52.809]  Uh, we out here in Nebraska just got steamrolled by the neocon election machine.
[01:58:53.449 --> 01:59:00.512]  I don't know if you know about this or not, but... Yeah, your, uh, Senator Hagel owns the majority of the voting machines in the state.
[01:59:00.532 --> 01:59:01.192]  That's right.
[01:59:01.232 --> 01:59:15.157]  So imagine owning the company that people cast votes for you, and Nebraska's one of the worst where the polls, mainstream polls, will show a candidate's gonna win by 15 or 20 points in some cases, but magically Hagel and others win by 15 points over them.
[01:59:15.457 --> 01:59:16.217]  That's impossible.
[01:59:17.128 --> 01:59:19.049]  Well, here's what just happened.
[01:59:19.369 --> 01:59:25.933]  We had the most popular person in the history of this state, Tom Osborne, their former football coach.
[01:59:26.373 --> 01:59:31.036]  I mean, the acronym that went with Tom Osborne was that he walks on water.
[01:59:31.156 --> 01:59:33.557]  I mean, the Husker Nation loved him.
[01:59:33.877 --> 01:59:39.760]  And if you've ever been through Nebraska, you know there really isn't much out here except for corn crops and Huskers.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:40.701]  That's it.
[01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:46.444]  And he was their absolute, he was their hero on all respects.
[01:59:47.133 --> 01:59:56.256]  So he runs for governor against Heinemann, who inherited the governorship from Mike Johansson, who was appointed by President Bush as Secretary of Agriculture.
[01:59:56.336 --> 01:59:58.496]  Anyway, Heinemann was one of the good old boys.
[01:59:59.377 --> 02:00:10.440]  And so Osborne ran as a Republican against Heinemann for the candidacy for governor of Nebraska.
[02:00:11.674 --> 02:00:15.057]  And everybody knew that Osborne was way popular.
[02:00:15.157 --> 02:00:17.159]  I mean, it wasn't even a contest.
[02:00:17.599 --> 02:00:23.043]  Because in the minds of Nebraskans, Osborne has already been elected with three national football championships.
[02:00:23.123 --> 02:00:23.644]  I understand.
[02:00:23.664 --> 02:00:26.726]  And that's about the extent of the mentality of Nebraska voters.
[02:00:26.766 --> 02:00:28.908]  Nebraska's the most football state in the country.
[02:00:28.928 --> 02:00:30.790]  When people think it's Texas, it's really Nebraska.
[02:00:31.530 --> 02:00:33.051]  So, tell us what happened.
[02:00:33.071 --> 02:00:34.072]  Surprise, surprise!
[02:00:34.653 --> 02:00:39.937]  Real quick, what happened here is, Heinemann was just not even in the polls.
[02:00:40.382 --> 02:00:50.108]  And suddenly, the Omaha World Herald, who is part owner in the secret neocon vote counting company called Election Systems and Software, they're in it with Hagel.
[02:00:51.149 --> 02:01:05.717]  Suddenly, the World Herald published these polls that look like a company on the stock market that went from way, way, way down in the red to suddenly a stellar... Oh yeah, that's what happens always a few days before the election when they're going to state something.
[02:01:05.937 --> 02:01:08.319]  They'll put out a fake poll to confuse people, you know.
[02:01:08.939 --> 02:01:23.389]  And I'm looking at this state poll, and they also, the Neocons also had Tom Osborne's hometown of Hastings, Nebraska, where he was, you know, absolutely Jesus Christ, voting against Osborne and for Heinemann.
[02:01:23.770 --> 02:01:36.879]  And they made up this article and said the reason why his own hometown, which absolutely eulogized him beyond belief, voted against Tom Osborne was because people just felt that
[02:01:37.361 --> 02:01:40.083]  A football coach wouldn't be a good governor.
[02:01:40.103 --> 02:01:41.904]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:01:41.924 --> 02:01:50.371]  You want to write an email up for me, an article about that man and make all your points and send it to tipsandinfowars.com or ryanandinfowars.com.
[02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:50.951]  We'd post it.
[02:01:51.251 --> 02:01:51.932]  Why don't you do that?
[02:01:53.373 --> 02:01:54.393]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:55.975 --> 02:02:01.679]  I hadn't been following the election there, but I had seen that there was the former football coach running for governor and, I mean, what do you expect?
[02:02:01.719 --> 02:02:04.541]  It doesn't matter if the polls say he's going to win, he's going to lose!
[02:02:05.538 --> 02:02:09.439]  If you're not New World Order, you're not going to win an election.
[02:02:09.459 --> 02:02:11.900]  35% of the country plus has these machines in.
[02:02:12.801 --> 02:02:13.841]  And it just doesn't matter.
[02:02:14.461 --> 02:02:16.522]  I do know about Nebraska politics, though.
[02:02:17.282 --> 02:02:19.443]  That's why they're so arrogant right now, folks.
[02:02:20.363 --> 02:02:23.644]  You're going to see people getting re-elected who've got 25% approval records.
[02:02:24.245 --> 02:02:30.347]  And if you don't like it, men will drop by to wear black masks and drive armored vehicles that have machine guns, and they'll blow your guts all over the wall.
[02:02:30.387 --> 02:02:30.927]  How's that sound?
[02:02:31.861 --> 02:02:34.026]  We're going to take your pension funds.
[02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:34.366]  Don't worry.
[02:02:34.426 --> 02:02:36.150]  The New World Order wants you to know that.
[02:02:36.170 --> 02:02:37.853]  They're just going to say we're here to take them.
[02:02:37.974 --> 02:02:38.454]  Nothing you can do.
[02:02:41.801 --> 02:02:48.605]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:48.925 --> 02:02:50.306]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:50.506 --> 02:02:52.707]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:52.847 --> 02:02:54.948]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:55.228 --> 02:03:00.171]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:00.491 --> 02:03:04.533]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:04.773 --> 02:03:06.554]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:06.634 --> 02:03:17.278]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.418 --> 02:03:19.318]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:19.518 --> 02:03:23.400]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:54.169]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:45.155 --> 02:04:46.015]  Look no further!
[02:04:46.315 --> 02:04:48.896]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:04:49.316 --> 02:04:57.840]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.681]  You can order everything you need on the web
[02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:00.362]  I think so.
[02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:15.840]  I'm good.
[02:05:43.115 --> 02:05:49.136]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:49.736 --> 02:05:52.777]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.257 --> 02:05:55.317]  Alright, we'll get some more of your calls here in just a moment.
[02:05:55.917 --> 02:06:04.019]  More information on Bush's ridiculous speech he's going to be giving this evening for his total amnesty plan, more smoke and mirrors.
[02:06:06.099 --> 02:06:08.319]  But during the last segment, a lady called in from Nebraska.
[02:06:08.439 --> 02:06:11.720]  I knew that the former head of the Nebraska football team, the three-time champion,
[02:06:12.509 --> 02:06:13.910]  was a gubernatorial candidate.
[02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:15.510]  Last time I heard he was a shoe-in.
[02:06:15.791 --> 02:06:17.311]  Wild poll numbers for him.
[02:06:19.172 --> 02:06:26.095]  And then magically, magically, the establishment governor beat him.
[02:06:26.155 --> 02:06:27.136]  I didn't know that.
[02:06:27.176 --> 02:06:28.176]  I hadn't been following it.
[02:06:29.857 --> 02:06:37.540]  But I do know that Senator Chuck Hagel owns the majority of the company when he first ran for Senate.
[02:06:38.941 --> 02:06:40.582]  And he was 15 points behind
[02:06:41.329 --> 02:06:53.417]  In the major polls, but magically on election day, when he first got in the Senate years ago now, Hagel just exploded past his candidate and won by a gigantic margin.
[02:06:53.437 --> 02:06:54.317]  I think it was like 14%.
[02:06:55.298 --> 02:06:57.379]  And that just keeps happening in Nebraska.
[02:06:57.999 --> 02:07:04.503]  The problem with election fraud, people have been emailing me, they've been calling me, they say, Alex, we're sick of hearing about 9-11.
[02:07:04.784 --> 02:07:06.885]  Now, it is a minority that's saying that.
[02:07:06.925 --> 02:07:08.606]  Some people want to hear more about it.
[02:07:09.244 --> 02:07:15.806]  But they say, Alex, we want to hear more about election fraud, about Diebold, about all these different companies.
[02:07:18.246 --> 02:07:19.046]  Here's the problem.
[02:07:22.167 --> 02:07:30.109]  A lot of times when I'm talking about 9-11, I hesitate to even get into it because I'm not going to do it justice.
[02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:33.150]  I don't like to make the claim
[02:07:35.522 --> 02:07:59.746]  That the government carried out 9-11 without backing it up and there's so much evidence to back it up that a lot of days I will just specifically talk about 9-11 so we can detail just some of the evidence and then sometimes a caller will call in when I've got another guest on about another subject and want to get into 9-11 and I'm always happy to but I always feel bad just
[02:08:00.962 --> 02:08:05.764]  Just making one or two points and then moving on because this is something that's so important.
[02:08:05.804 --> 02:08:16.008]  I know we have new listeners every second tuning in on all of our AM and FM affiliates out there on the internet as well, and shortwave as well, that I almost think it does a disservice.
[02:08:16.749 --> 02:08:19.330]  And I haven't covered enough election fraud in years past.
[02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:20.830]  I mean, I've been talking about it for 10 years.
[02:08:21.731 --> 02:08:25.152]  I really talked about it back during the 2000 election and in 2004, but it's so demonstrated now.
[02:08:30.191 --> 02:08:37.436]  For those that don't know, a whole bunch of engineers and scientists and software programmers from a whole bunch of companies have gone public.
[02:08:38.296 --> 02:08:52.266]  They've caught convicted felons and convicted hackers and people that are involved in electronic fraud, running Diebold and vice-presidential places, vice-presidents of the company, running scams in California.
[02:08:53.007 --> 02:09:03.136]  We've caught Republican hired companies running scams to jam phone banks and block voters in Florida, and it's just admitted, not debated, and no one gets in trouble.
[02:09:04.677 --> 02:09:07.619]  I mean, there's literally, this is not an exaggeration.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:16.467]  I haven't counted it all up, but it's got to be in the five thousands of numbers of mainstream news articles that I've seen.
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.921]  But they're all regional news.
[02:09:20.121 --> 02:09:21.902]  You'll see one here, one there.
[02:09:22.142 --> 02:09:24.123]  Every time there's an election, there's hundreds.
[02:09:24.463 --> 02:09:26.844]  And there's elections all the time.
[02:09:26.864 --> 02:09:34.288]  The exit polls show this candidate won by 70%, but they only got 10% on the machines.
[02:09:34.308 --> 02:09:42.092]  An employee was pulled over by police drunk with ballot boxes and had just been caught dumping them in the trash can.
[02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:53.820]  You know, employee quits, goes public from county elections board and says they're engaging in fraud and that members of the CIA were giving them orders.
[02:09:54.981 --> 02:10:03.128]  Head of voter board says that wireless modems are accessing in real time, illegally, into these systems.
[02:10:03.168 --> 02:10:04.029]  I mean, it just...
[02:10:04.841 --> 02:10:25.901]  I mean every day, there are sites that cover this and I go to them a few times a week and I print the stuff off and then hardly ever talk about it because it's like, it's like after you've caught someone, let's say Henry Lee Lucas or somebody and he takes cops to ten places, there are dead bodies and the cops dig them up, at that point just, it's proven he's a murderer, did he kill these other 120 people?
[02:10:26.021 --> 02:10:30.165]  I don't know, just send the guy to the electric chair, lethal injection, whatever.
[02:10:32.942 --> 02:10:35.765]  Of course, Bush gave him a stay of execution for some reason, but side issue.
[02:10:36.565 --> 02:10:39.448]  It just doesn't even matter anymore.
[02:10:39.488 --> 02:10:43.432]  I mean, case closed.
[02:10:43.552 --> 02:10:46.254]  It's just, why should we even continue to prove it?
[02:10:47.255 --> 02:10:48.176]  It's totally proven.
[02:10:48.216 --> 02:10:55.042]  You've just got a general public that cannot believe in America the elections have been stolen.
[02:10:55.999 --> 02:10:59.463]  Now it's only, this number's a year old, it's growing.
[02:10:59.483 --> 02:11:16.501]  They have the Help America Vote Act, voter assistance legislation that Chuckie Schumer sponsored, that George Bush signed, that Bush helped write, and it was six billion bucks to pay the counties and cities and states to put in these electronic voting systems
[02:11:17.518 --> 02:11:29.541]  And the specifications for the federal money designs it to make sure it's a fraud and to make sure no one can look into it and to ensure there's no paper trail and no recount possible.
[02:11:31.602 --> 02:11:40.264]  And then you look at the big three companies, Diebold, Sequoia, others, and who are they?
[02:11:42.688 --> 02:11:57.592]  They are openly run, in every case, by one of them is the former head of the National Security Agency, NSA, two other systems, one's run by the former director of the CIA, the other big companies run by the former deputy director of the CIA,
[02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:59.590]  We're good to go.
[02:12:15.576 --> 02:12:17.379]  There are retina scans to get in.
[02:12:17.439 --> 02:12:18.440]  There's barbed wire around.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:19.682]  I mean, it's a joke, okay?
[02:12:19.702 --> 02:12:26.511]  The government runs it now with 30-plus percent of the country, 35-plus percent now under their control.
[02:12:26.871 --> 02:12:28.614]  And it's being put in everywhere else right now.
[02:12:28.654 --> 02:12:29.996]  A few states are trying to block it.
[02:12:32.018 --> 02:12:33.681]  And that's why they're so arrogant.
[02:12:33.741 --> 02:12:36.085]  It's just, we're going to enslave you is what they're saying.
[02:12:36.145 --> 02:12:37.587]  We're going to do whatever we want.
[02:12:37.607 --> 02:12:38.909]  We're going to take your pension funds.
[02:12:38.949 --> 02:12:40.291]  We're going to have a national draft.
[02:12:40.711 --> 02:12:43.616]  We're going to carry out terror attacks to mobilize you to support us.
[02:12:43.716 --> 02:12:45.559]  You'll think that we're your saviors.
[02:12:46.753 --> 02:13:04.760]  And it's just, we're going to spy on you illegally, and we're going to war profiteer personally, and we're going to engage in no-bid contracts, even with American companies, and we're going to have a bunch of members of Homeland Security be involved in all these felonies, but that'll all get blocked, and we're just, we're criminals, and we're going to have our way with you.
[02:13:05.981 --> 02:13:10.683]  And we're going to ship our money overseas into offshore accounts, and we're going to do it all to you.
[02:13:10.703 --> 02:13:11.703]  There's nothing you're going to do about it.
[02:13:12.941 --> 02:13:24.905]  And we're going to militarize the police and train them near all the enemies and give them little anti-terror training manuals that say homeschoolers, Christians, gun owners, property rights activists, anyone who makes frequent references to the U.S.
[02:13:24.945 --> 02:13:26.346]  Constitution are terrorists.
[02:13:26.926 --> 02:13:31.788]  And we're going to ship drugs in and if your kids use them, we're going to put them in our own prisons that we the drug dealers own.
[02:13:32.725 --> 02:13:43.809]  And if you don't like that, and you try to protest or demonstration, have a demonstration, we'll have men in black riot outfits dressed up like Darth Vader come out and crack your heads, and we'll have provocateurs stir something up so we can put you in jail.
[02:13:44.169 --> 02:13:48.370]  But if you're illegal aliens, we'll roll the red carpet out for you, and it just goes on and on.
[02:13:49.231 --> 02:14:02.215]  And we're gonna attack Iran and start World War III, and we're gonna, and if you don't like it, we'll just send a SWAT team by, and they'll just come into your house, and kick your teeth in, and put you in a paddy wagon, and haul you off, and if you try to resist,
[02:14:02.788 --> 02:14:06.669]  We'll just shoot you four or five times in the head and splatter your brains all over the wall.
[02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.810]  That's America!
[02:14:07.890 --> 02:14:08.610]  Just shut up!
[02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:10.411]  We're a banana republic now.
[02:14:10.711 --> 02:14:11.991]  We're going to enslave you.
[02:14:12.191 --> 02:14:13.992]  The enslavement hasn't even begun yet.
[02:14:14.052 --> 02:14:15.092]  We know you're going to struggle.
[02:14:15.292 --> 02:14:28.897]  So we've got this big straitjacket and this ball and chain and these monocles and we're hooking them up to you right now and that ain't freedom you hear the sound of the clicking chains clinking along behind you.
[02:14:29.077 --> 02:14:31.338]  That's new world order terror boys and girls.
[02:14:34.178 --> 02:14:35.483]  And I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:14:38.573 --> 02:14:39.456]  This is what we face.
[02:14:39.476 --> 02:14:40.359]  This is what we've become.
[02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:42.450]  Germany had their round of it.
[02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:43.411]  Russia's had theirs.
[02:14:43.511 --> 02:14:44.471]  China's still under it.
[02:14:44.811 --> 02:14:45.791]  Cuba had theirs.
[02:14:45.851 --> 02:14:50.273]  Almost every country in history, going back 6,000 years, is run by despots.
[02:14:50.713 --> 02:14:52.613]  And you're going to learn how to be poor slaves.
[02:14:52.654 --> 02:14:54.274]  And don't worry, you'll still have your movie theaters.
[02:14:54.294 --> 02:14:56.735]  You'll still have your baubles, your trinkets.
[02:14:56.995 --> 02:14:58.575]  But you're not going to have any real wealth.
[02:14:58.595 --> 02:14:59.956]  You're not going to have any real future.
[02:15:00.296 --> 02:15:01.676]  You're not going to be able to eat healthy food.
[02:15:01.696 --> 02:15:04.197]  You're going to be given nothing but adulterated, genetically engineered trash.
[02:15:04.901 --> 02:15:17.168]  Then we're gonna take your guns, and if you're a little toady of the government, you can still keep your guns, but be a little deputy of them, and I'm sure a lot of y'all love that, and America's gone, America's dead, freedom's over, and we're getting rid of our borders, and we're gonna have a world government.
[02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:23.472]  And that's the end of it, and that's what they've done to us, and that's what the New World Order is, and I'm mad about it.
[02:15:26.014 --> 02:15:28.035]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carrie in Florida.
[02:15:28.055 --> 02:15:28.755]  Carrie, go ahead.
[02:15:29.195 --> 02:15:29.976]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:15:30.838 --> 02:15:33.479]  We have something else very serious to think about too.
[02:15:33.559 --> 02:15:41.762]  I've been hearing this talk all over the state and also on TV about people starting another party and not voting Republican or Democrat.
[02:15:42.682 --> 02:15:44.643]  And I think this might be a very good idea.
[02:15:46.203 --> 02:15:54.786]  And also, we found out that we've got a serious problem from NASA that we're finding out the whole universe is warming up, not only just the Earth.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.101]  There is something going on and they don't know what's happening.
[02:15:58.281 --> 02:15:59.622]  No, I agree with you.
[02:15:59.642 --> 02:16:00.362]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:00.422 --> 02:16:10.026]  About two months ago, NASA came out and said they thought we'd hit the highest heat cycle radiated power of the sun ever recorded in the last hundred years.
[02:16:10.066 --> 02:16:13.907]  They thought that was the biggest 11 year, it's an 11 and a half year cycle to be precise.
[02:16:15.368 --> 02:16:22.031]  And they're saying the sun in the next 11 years, and that cycle's about to tick off, is going to increase its brightness by 50%.
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:26.482]  And boys and girls, that's going to be wild.
[02:16:27.143 --> 02:16:36.871]  But don't worry, they'll use that crisis to blame it on freedom, blame it on fossil fuels, blame it on our economy, and they'll have a nice global tax cut of the crisis it creates.
[02:16:37.352 --> 02:16:39.293]  They've already got their hoax hole set up for that.
[02:16:40.555 --> 02:16:44.478]  Everything's about hoaxes with these people, and there's not a hoax we hadn't bought.
[02:16:44.498 --> 02:16:46.360]  There's not a hoax we're not going to buy.
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.142]  You want to be ignorant, bug-eyed slaves?
[02:16:49.162 --> 02:16:51.404]  You're going to get a front row seat at it.
[02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:58.689]  I think we're going to make it through this with God's help, but I... You know how I really feel?
[02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:59.589]  This is how I really feel.
[02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.970]  I've had enough.
[02:17:03.391 --> 02:17:04.132]  I've had enough.
[02:17:06.233 --> 02:17:08.795]  I mean, it's just, I'm wallowing in the crimes of these people.
[02:17:08.855 --> 02:17:09.975]  It's just, it's ridiculous!
[02:17:10.035 --> 02:17:13.077]  I can't even... It's exhausting to try to even cover it all.
[02:17:15.498 --> 02:17:17.880]  In fact, throughout history, I've never seen
[02:17:20.493 --> 02:17:23.074]  A government more flagrantly engaged in crime.
[02:17:23.114 --> 02:17:31.218]  I mean, there were governments that did worse things, but not as many and not as obvious and not as ridiculous were the so-called free people that could have done something about it.
[02:17:32.559 --> 02:17:37.101]  So just keep loving the Democrats, keep loving Bush, keep sucking your thumbs.
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.502]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:17:45.782 --> 02:17:49.283]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:17:49.363 --> 02:17:53.305]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:17:53.525 --> 02:17:59.687]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:00.088 --> 02:18:08.011]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:18:08.411 --> 02:18:13.773]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:18:13.913 --> 02:18:17.694]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:18.055 --> 02:18:19.895]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:18:19.975 --> 02:18:22.136]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:19:41.909 --> 02:19:44.411]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:45.091 --> 02:19:51.756]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:55.219]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:56.019 --> 02:20:02.243]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:20:03.144 --> 02:20:11.230]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[02:20:12.259 --> 02:20:20.123]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[02:20:22.925 --> 02:20:23.125]  Call now.
[02:20:23.165 --> 02:20:27.407]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:41.497 --> 02:20:43.338]  Gas prices are out of control.
[02:20:43.558 --> 02:20:47.741]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[02:20:48.081 --> 02:20:52.603]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[02:20:52.803 --> 02:20:57.446]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using the
[02:20:57.526 --> 02:20:58.806]  We're good to go.

[02:21:21.396 --> 02:21:27.441]  And, you can also have a lucrative home-based business by simply sharing this amazing, money-saving product with others.
[02:21:27.581 --> 02:21:28.121]  Don't wait!
[02:21:28.241 --> 02:21:29.982]  Call MPG Biz now at 800-526-1778.
[02:21:30.022 --> 02:21:30.223]  That's 800-526-1778.
[02:21:30.243 --> 02:21:32.384]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:32.504 --> 02:21:32.944]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:42.474 --> 02:21:53.278]  We've got a few really important audio clips concerning the border war coming up.
[02:21:53.298 --> 02:21:54.138]  More of your calls.
[02:21:54.158 --> 02:21:55.878]  I want to just run through some of the news too.
[02:21:57.979 --> 02:22:01.220]  Kerry and Florida brought up a third party saving us.
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:04.321]  And I'm not against forming a third party.
[02:22:04.341 --> 02:22:05.581]  I'm not against coalitions.
[02:22:06.362 --> 02:22:11.003]  But we get 60% turnouts in national federal elections on average, presidential elections.
[02:22:11.869 --> 02:22:17.011]  We get about 8% nationally for local elections, and locally is where you can still have an effect.
[02:22:17.951 --> 02:22:28.175]  Even if you pose as a pro-New World Order person, and it's going to come down to that by the way, with the electronic voting machine fraud, and then get in there and do something, it's the only place you can still have an effect.
[02:22:28.655 --> 02:22:29.915]  State, county, city level.
[02:22:30.595 --> 02:22:32.456]  People always want solutions, that's it.
[02:22:32.596 --> 02:22:34.837]  I mean, run for school board, run for water district.
[02:22:35.327 --> 02:22:46.751]  Wherever you see corruption, wherever you see graft, expose the double set of books, the comprehensive annual financial reports, get involved in lobbies for the Second Amendment, land rights, fight for those.
[02:22:47.352 --> 02:22:52.394]  But see, we're getting into a point where, oh, 97% in Texas polls don't want the transponder toll roads.
[02:22:52.694 --> 02:22:53.634]  We're going to do it anyway.
[02:22:53.714 --> 02:22:55.135]  We've paid off all your politicians.
[02:22:55.915 --> 02:22:58.516]  Oh, 90% of you don't want illegal aliens at open borders.
[02:22:58.536 --> 02:22:59.516]  We're going to do it anyways.
[02:22:59.676 --> 02:23:01.217]  But we're going to call it fixing the problem.
[02:23:02.904 --> 02:23:06.005]  That'd be like if you'd cut a finger off and they said, we're going to fix your cut finger.
[02:23:06.025 --> 02:23:15.769]  We're going to cut both your arms off and both your legs off, stab you 45 times in the chest, cut your heart out, cut your brain out, and beat your face in with a sledgehammer.
[02:23:16.089 --> 02:23:21.832]  That'll fix the... I mean, it's just... Oh, you stubbed your toe.
[02:23:21.872 --> 02:23:23.352]  Here, we'll chop your leg off.
[02:23:24.273 --> 02:23:27.274]  So if I'm angry, I just... I shouldn't even...
[02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:33.934]  As a country, you, the listeners that care and love this nation... I'm not talking about thumbsuckers, I'm talking about neocons and liberals.
[02:23:35.715 --> 02:23:36.675]  You know what's going on.
[02:23:36.715 --> 02:23:39.457]  We shouldn't even have to... I mean, how obvious is this?
[02:23:39.477 --> 02:23:40.458]  This is ridiculous!
[02:23:41.378 --> 02:23:42.439]  The stock market is at $11,600?
[02:23:42.599 --> 02:23:45.661]  The stock market's at $6,500 if you do the math.
[02:23:45.681 --> 02:23:46.321]  With a 46% devalued dollar.
[02:23:46.341 --> 02:23:47.182]  I'm just in a bad mood.
[02:23:58.047 --> 02:24:02.388]  Again, my good childhood friend, my best friend through childhood is basically dead right now.
[02:24:02.408 --> 02:24:11.450]  Had total failure of a bunch of organs last night and is on a respirator and is basically dead and is just, I'm in a bad mood.
[02:24:12.471 --> 02:24:16.232]  I probably shouldn't have come in and done this show, but there's so much news to cover, so much to talk about.
[02:24:16.252 --> 02:24:21.693]  I just... But this is how I really feel about the country.
[02:24:22.373 --> 02:24:23.754]  And believe me, I've done my homework.
[02:24:23.794 --> 02:24:24.694]  This is what I do.
[02:24:25.737 --> 02:24:28.219]  And I talk to all the experts in every field.
[02:24:28.239 --> 02:24:29.260]  You hear them here on the air.
[02:24:29.741 --> 02:24:36.487]  I live this constantly, and it's really painful to watch my country dying, where my family lives!
[02:24:37.588 --> 02:24:40.671]  Our children don't have a future because of a bunch of criminals!
[02:24:41.151 --> 02:24:43.694]  And they're so obvious, they're not even slick!
[02:24:45.055 --> 02:24:47.457]  But we, like a bunch of saps, go along with them.
[02:24:47.477 --> 02:24:48.438]  We're conned by them.
[02:24:49.497 --> 02:24:51.939]  And it's not cute and it's not funny to be conned.
[02:24:52.419 --> 02:24:58.042]  And I'm tired of smiley face people walking up to me on the street, they are the minority, and making little jokes about the New World Order.
[02:24:58.283 --> 02:25:00.404]  Hey buddy, the New World Order isn't funny!
[02:25:01.384 --> 02:25:04.026]  If you had any sense, you'd be scared out of your wits!
[02:25:05.607 --> 02:25:07.328]  Skunk in Kansas City, go ahead.
[02:25:07.768 --> 02:25:09.129]  Hey Alex, how you doing my friend?
[02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:10.530]  Pretty good, I guess.
[02:25:10.770 --> 02:25:15.893]  Alright, I just got a couple quick observations, things that I thought about over the weekend after I heard our Fuhrer
[02:25:17.589 --> 02:25:20.650]  ...announced that we may potentially be putting boots along the border.
[02:25:21.090 --> 02:25:29.373]  What's going to happen when, not if, but when, some of these banditos start taking pop shots at our troops from the other side of the border, from Mexico?
[02:25:29.433 --> 02:25:31.614]  The video will just keep it quiet in the local news.
[02:25:31.674 --> 02:25:32.714]  It happens every day, sir.
[02:25:33.234 --> 02:25:33.735]  Absolutely.
[02:25:33.775 --> 02:25:34.475]  My other thought...
[02:25:34.975 --> 02:25:37.877]  Is, uh, what if this is just the beginning of something a little bit bigger?
[02:25:37.957 --> 02:25:42.639]  First troops along the border, then troops, you know, going into the cities to help root out illegals?
[02:25:42.799 --> 02:25:50.844]  It's totally constitutional to have troops on the border, but I agree the image is troops for Katrina, troops for the border, troops, troops, troops.
[02:25:51.244 --> 02:25:57.649]  The state governors need to raise and pay for their own border paramilitary forces.
[02:25:58.029 --> 02:25:59.690]  That's how the Founding Fathers handled it.
[02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:01.352]  It's how Andrew Jackson handled it.
[02:26:02.352 --> 02:26:04.954]  Now, the federal troops can be on the border and it's constitutional.
[02:26:05.194 --> 02:26:07.396]  But I agree, it's still a dangerous backdrop.
[02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:13.274]  And I just got one comment, I guess, to cap it off, because I know there's other people that want to get through.
[02:26:13.294 --> 02:26:14.375]  No, no, you've been holding long enough, sir.
[02:26:14.415 --> 02:26:15.637]  I want to hear what you have to say about the border.
[02:26:15.677 --> 02:26:16.237]  I interrupted you.
[02:26:16.257 --> 02:26:16.558]  Go ahead.
[02:26:16.578 --> 02:26:17.499]  I'll hold you over if need be.
[02:26:17.879 --> 02:26:24.988]  Well, it's just... I've been looking at this border issue for quite a while now, and I keep hearing the same sides of the argument.
[02:26:25.453 --> 02:26:28.917]  And I mean, it goes back even into, like you say, with Bill Clinton, with NAFTA.
[02:26:29.317 --> 02:26:37.045]  Years ago, I told people that NAFTA was going to destroy our economy, that it was going to send all of our businesses, all of our major infrastructure businesses... It's an EU!
[02:26:37.105 --> 02:26:39.428]  This is how the EU started, as a quote, trade deal.
[02:26:39.448 --> 02:26:42.271]  They don't just say, we're getting rid of your concrete, they do it through trade deals.
[02:26:42.848 --> 02:26:43.569]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:43.649 --> 02:26:48.354]  And I made this argument to my brother-in-law years ago, who's a Wharton Business School graduate.
[02:26:48.794 --> 02:26:50.376]  And he thought it was absurd.
[02:26:50.856 --> 02:26:56.182]  And I just saw him again recently, because he came out here to Kansas City to visit me and his sister, my wife.
[02:26:56.822 --> 02:27:02.368]  And, you know, I brought it back up, and he just kind of shook his head, and he goes, you know, I didn't really think of it back then.
[02:27:02.408 --> 02:27:05.571]  I was just out of college, I was fairly liberal, and I just wasn't thinking.
[02:27:05.631 --> 02:27:06.012]  But, you know,
[02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:10.791]  Now, when I talk to people, I say, well, why do you think that, you know, gas costs more?
[02:27:10.831 --> 02:27:13.292]  Not just because, oh, the price of oil is going up.
[02:27:13.352 --> 02:27:14.773]  It's because the dollar is worth less.
[02:27:14.833 --> 02:27:16.033]  Why is the dollar worth less?
[02:27:16.353 --> 02:27:19.674]  Because we're fighting a war that communist countries are supporting.
[02:27:20.234 --> 02:27:21.955]  They don't seem to get the connection.
[02:27:21.975 --> 02:27:23.355]  Do you understand?
[02:27:23.435 --> 02:27:24.055]  No, I hear you.
[02:27:24.176 --> 02:27:26.116]  Do you want to make another point, or are you done?
[02:27:26.536 --> 02:27:27.537]  Oh, just one fast one.
[02:27:27.557 --> 02:27:27.857]  Stay there.
[02:27:28.057 --> 02:27:28.737]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:32.138 --> 02:27:33.038]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.518 --> 02:27:35.039]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.042 --> 02:27:38.803]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.805 --> 02:27:45.166]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:45.406 --> 02:27:47.447]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:47.588 --> 02:27:54.671]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:54.891 --> 02:28:03.495]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company for the past 57 years has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:28:53.311 --> 02:28:57.615]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:28:57.955 --> 02:29:00.958]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:01.278 --> 02:29:04.701]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:05.021 --> 02:29:14.386]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:14.646 --> 02:29:18.147]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:29:41.821 --> 02:29:48.206]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:48.506 --> 02:29:53.210]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[02:29:53.530 --> 02:30:01.176]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:01.476 --> 02:30:08.322]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:08.542 --> 02:30:09.923]  There are no side effects!
[02:30:10.263 --> 02:30:13.884]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[02:30:34.249 --> 02:30:34.509]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.529 --> 02:30:35.290]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:31:10.094 --> 02:31:11.936]  Things are going to get worse in this country.
[02:31:12.076 --> 02:31:14.619]  All the evidence, all the indicators show that.
[02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:22.107]  The good news is, we can wake people up, we can warn people, so as things get worse, they'll know who did it, they'll know why it happened.
[02:31:22.127 --> 02:31:29.155]  Because the globalists are masters at creating the crisis, and then they pose as the saviors, they offer the solution.
[02:31:30.683 --> 02:31:32.404]  And so we can win this thing.
[02:31:32.464 --> 02:31:34.165]  Their program is not going well.
[02:31:34.525 --> 02:31:35.606]  They're being exposed.
[02:31:35.626 --> 02:31:36.666]  They're being discredited.
[02:31:37.106 --> 02:31:40.949]  But they still are in control so they continue to move forward arrogantly.
[02:31:42.029 --> 02:31:44.691]  But really it's more than just moving forward in an arrogant fashion.
[02:31:45.051 --> 02:31:46.051]  They have to keep moving.
[02:31:46.091 --> 02:31:47.012]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:31:47.032 --> 02:31:53.375]  They've got to get it bigger and bigger and take over more and more just to protect themselves from the past crimes they've committed.
[02:31:54.716 --> 02:31:56.797]  So it's really a dissent into tyranny.
[02:31:58.024 --> 02:32:00.726]  That's what we're facing right now, and it's not pretty.
[02:32:00.766 --> 02:32:05.150]  I mean, they're setting up for mechanized, across-the-board mass oppression.
[02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:13.716]  Let's run through the whole raft of callers, then I'm going to get into news and the final segments we've got here left today together on this live Wednesday edition.
[02:32:14.937 --> 02:32:16.298]  Skunk and KC, finish up.
[02:32:16.338 --> 02:32:17.079]  The point you wanted to make?
[02:32:17.619 --> 02:32:23.224]  Oh, I just wanted to express, I believe the next 10 to 15 years in this country is going to be
[02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:26.041]  A very turbulent time.
[02:32:26.101 --> 02:32:38.304]  I think a lot of people are going to have to choose whether they're going to idly sit by and let the machine take them into its power, or if you're going to stand up and fight for what this country was founded on.
[02:32:39.244 --> 02:32:42.004]  Pursuit of happiness, justice, and freedom.
[02:32:42.584 --> 02:32:43.305]  It's that simple.
[02:32:43.325 --> 02:32:44.685]  Do you want your kids to be slaves?
[02:32:44.705 --> 02:32:45.925]  Do you want your kids to be free?
[02:32:45.965 --> 02:32:46.985]  That's what you need to ask.
[02:32:47.545 --> 02:32:50.146]  And, I mean, that's where you need to take your stand accordingly.
[02:32:51.508 --> 02:32:52.768]  I bid you Godspeed, Alex.
[02:32:52.788 --> 02:32:54.469]  You're going through some turbulent stuff yourself.
[02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:56.330]  I bid you well, my man.
[02:32:56.350 --> 02:32:56.830]  Have a good one.
[02:32:57.350 --> 02:32:58.030]  Thanks a lot.
[02:32:59.371 --> 02:33:02.192]  I appreciate those kind words.
[02:33:05.253 --> 02:33:06.313]  We do have to decide.
[02:33:06.333 --> 02:33:07.513]  I mean, we have to decide.
[02:33:07.533 --> 02:33:08.674]  Do I want to be free?
[02:33:08.714 --> 02:33:10.774]  Because if you want to be free, you're going to have to fight for it.
[02:33:11.114 --> 02:33:12.035]  You're going to have to stand up.
[02:33:12.095 --> 02:33:14.956]  And see, we've always had freedom, so we take it for granted.
[02:33:14.996 --> 02:33:17.277]  You don't know what you've got until it's gone, the song goes.
[02:33:18.017 --> 02:33:18.597]  And that's true.
[02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:22.211]  I mean, do you know what it's like to live on your knees?
[02:33:22.231 --> 02:33:23.791]  Do you know what it's like to be a slave?
[02:33:23.811 --> 02:33:29.713]  Do you know what it's like to have a government that can shove you around and doesn't care what happens to you or your bank accounts or your future?
[02:33:29.733 --> 02:33:40.656]  I mean, we already live in a system where they have grabbed millions of, they grab a million, four children a year from their families, most of them totally innocent.
[02:33:40.676 --> 02:33:44.177]  The government's five more times, five times more likely to abuse the children.
[02:33:44.835 --> 02:33:48.897]  We already have 15% of our kids on psychotropic or amphetamine type drugs that are deadly.
[02:33:49.297 --> 02:33:53.578]  The government's own numbers show they want to put 50% on the drugs in the next 10 years.
[02:33:53.598 --> 02:33:53.578]  50%!
[02:33:54.339 --> 02:33:57.820]  I mean half of us, half the kids on drugs.
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.041]  I mean this is, this is La La Land crazy twilight zone.
[02:34:02.081 --> 02:34:04.522]  I use that term a lot because it is.
[02:34:05.963 --> 02:34:08.704]  I know I talk a lot about this but I just can't get over it.
[02:34:08.724 --> 02:34:11.385]  I mean it really is in the Chicago Tribune and the BBC
[02:34:12.865 --> 02:34:26.539]  The Diane Corcoran Halliburton run giant white kidnapping rings, white slavery rings, where they kidnap kids to sell them for adoption, to blow their heads off for schnapp films, that's who they get sold to, to make them work in textile plants.
[02:34:26.579 --> 02:34:27.640]  I mean, it runs the gamut.
[02:34:28.281 --> 02:34:29.242]  Not all of them are being
[02:34:30.089 --> 02:34:32.210]  You know, killed in something like the movie The Hostel.
[02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:35.750]  But, I mean, this is... Again, and that's real!
[02:34:35.770 --> 02:34:38.831]  Do you understand that's real and it's in the newspaper?
[02:34:39.151 --> 02:34:44.353]  Think of 50 years ago, if it would have been in the front page of a major paper in the U.S.
[02:34:44.433 --> 02:34:47.634]  confirming this, it's not even being debated and nothing happens.
[02:34:48.634 --> 02:34:51.455]  And see, I'm supposed to just shut up and, oh, that's old news, Alex.
[02:34:53.075 --> 02:34:54.735]  I mean, right now my brain is reeling.
[02:34:54.835 --> 02:34:56.176]  I'm reeling right now.
[02:34:56.256 --> 02:34:56.796]  I reel
[02:34:58.725 --> 02:35:03.009]  In just... It's almost like vertigo from this.
[02:35:03.749 --> 02:35:05.210]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:35:05.250 --> 02:35:07.072]  It's like words aren't even proper.
[02:35:07.132 --> 02:35:11.355]  It's almost like it's... It's almost like it's not enough of an action.
[02:35:12.476 --> 02:35:25.386]  I mean, these people, they have created giant cadres, armies of psychopaths and criminals, and hitmen, murderers, just self-centered trash, really dark people.
[02:35:26.497 --> 02:35:33.301]  Really dark-hearted scum, and they're setting the whole world up as their big playground, and we're the prey.
[02:35:34.261 --> 02:35:35.382]  And I just don't like it.
[02:35:36.923 --> 02:35:37.343]  You know what?
[02:35:37.423 --> 02:35:38.924]  I shouldn't be called radical.
[02:35:40.405 --> 02:35:42.946]  Again, this is not a radical broadcast.
[02:35:43.686 --> 02:35:48.729]  There is nothing radical about reporting the dollars plunged in value.
[02:35:48.749 --> 02:35:52.331]  There's nothing radical about talking about the Federal Reserve being private and a big scam.
[02:35:53.072 --> 02:35:57.313]  There's nothing radical about saying official plans to force drug half our kids is wrong.
[02:35:58.133 --> 02:36:01.254]  Over two-thirds of the foster children in America are already on these drugs.
[02:36:02.154 --> 02:36:03.394]  And they've got a captive audience.
[02:36:04.774 --> 02:36:07.095]  I mean it's been in the New York Daily News.
[02:36:08.375 --> 02:36:15.817]  It's been in the New York Papers that they take little black kids and they don't just give them AIDS medication that's toxic when they don't even have AIDS.
[02:36:16.397 --> 02:36:19.117]  They give them pesticide and pesticide trials and murder.
[02:36:19.577 --> 02:36:20.578]  It's mainly black kids.
[02:36:22.298 --> 02:36:22.858]  I don't know why.
[02:36:23.951 --> 02:36:26.652]  Actually, I don't know why, but it's a whole history of why.
[02:36:27.112 --> 02:36:33.675]  Statistically, it's easier to get black people's kids, and they broke the family up so bad they won't go as hog wild.
[02:36:33.875 --> 02:36:35.776]  I guess they've been trained to just be fed on.
[02:36:36.076 --> 02:36:37.516]  I just, good God, I can't help it.
[02:36:38.297 --> 02:36:39.777]  I just can't handle it.
[02:36:40.398 --> 02:36:51.262]  These people are just scum out of the pit of hell, and they're setting up a system to literally butcher us en masse, and I am not going to go along with it.
[02:36:52.443 --> 02:37:03.631]  I mean, I gotta tell you, I'm trying to fix this peacefully, I'm trying to resist it peacefully, but when they try big massive Katrina stuff nationwide, you gotta defend yourself.
[02:37:03.912 --> 02:37:19.703]  And if you aren't heavily armed, and all of us, including myself, need to take time out to go to the shooting ranges, to stay proficient, to have friends and family we trust, and to have friends that have got their heads screwed on straight, that know what we're going into.
[02:37:20.684 --> 02:37:22.025]  I mean, when we got a government,
[02:37:23.314 --> 02:37:26.216]  That protects Halliburton and Dyncor.
[02:37:26.957 --> 02:37:29.819]  And I've had Dyncor's people through the grapevine threatening me.
[02:37:29.859 --> 02:37:31.601]  You can just go straight to Hades.
[02:37:32.301 --> 02:37:38.967]  I'm so far past being afraid of people like you, you giant, pus-filled, maggot, scum-sucking bastards!
[02:37:39.647 --> 02:37:41.569]  I'd like to rip your heads off!
[02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:44.271]  I just... I shouldn't even do a radio show right now.
[02:37:44.331 --> 02:37:45.252]  Just play a song for a minute.
[02:37:45.272 --> 02:37:45.953]  I'm about to blow up.
[02:37:46.473 --> 02:37:47.214]  Just put something on.
[02:37:47.254 --> 02:37:47.894]  Put a song on.
[02:37:47.934 --> 02:37:48.535]  Put anything on.
[02:37:49.095 --> 02:37:50.096]  I just can't even deal with it.
[02:38:49.907 --> 02:39:15.429]  Well, I know what's right I got just one life In a world that keeps on pushing me around But I'll stand my ground And I won't back down I won't back down
[02:39:29.665 --> 02:39:32.622]  We're staying alive, friend.
[02:40:41.584 --> 02:40:43.185]  Think about it for a second.
[02:40:44.386 --> 02:40:50.811]  If you go look at the President's plan, a four-year-old could read it and figure out that it is a total amnesty.
[02:40:50.951 --> 02:40:52.452]  But he says it is an amnesty.
[02:40:52.512 --> 02:40:54.734]  He says it's the cure for the illegal aliens.
[02:40:56.574 --> 02:41:03.517]  And now we're going to have neocons all over talk radio, as usual, lying and saying it's good and calling us liars.
[02:41:03.917 --> 02:41:05.577]  I just, I'm so sick of it.
[02:41:07.298 --> 02:41:22.123]  And I think about John Yoo, White House Counsel, getting up at a CFR meeting and being confronted even by a CFR member, saying, why did you write a memo saying you can torture children in front of their parents?
[02:41:23.052 --> 02:41:24.012]  Even sexually.
[02:41:24.433 --> 02:41:26.233]  And John, you said, yeah, I wrote that.
[02:41:26.293 --> 02:41:26.974]  Yeah, we can.
[02:41:27.074 --> 02:41:29.455]  I mean, and they're not going to be arrested, folks.
[02:41:29.615 --> 02:41:30.635]  They're going to be promoted.
[02:41:31.315 --> 02:41:35.657]  Do you realize what type of inhuman, monster Alberto Gonzales is?
[02:41:35.717 --> 02:41:37.278]  He's our Attorney General.
[02:41:37.958 --> 02:41:43.740]  A guy who says the President is above the law is the head law enforcement officer in this country.
[02:41:45.181 --> 02:41:46.261]  They are sharks.
[02:41:46.421 --> 02:41:47.402]  They are vermin.
[02:41:49.123 --> 02:41:52.404]  They are cold-blooded killers.
[02:41:54.265 --> 02:41:57.287]  And people are going to make excuses for them.
[02:41:58.989 --> 02:42:00.149]  They're going to get beaten again.
[02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:01.470]  Evil always implodes.
[02:42:01.530 --> 02:42:02.992]  It always fails.
[02:42:04.373 --> 02:42:05.393]  I just am sick of it.
[02:42:05.934 --> 02:42:07.215]  I know today I'm in a really dark mood.
[02:42:07.235 --> 02:42:08.876]  It's because I got a call early this morning.
[02:42:08.916 --> 02:42:12.999]  I want my best friend from childhood dying and going to see him on a respirator.
[02:42:14.144 --> 02:42:26.354]  You know, on the verge of death, it'll focus you, it'll make you in a little bit of a dark mood, but believe me, that's not the reason I'm being so negative predominantly, it's because this Bush thing, it just pushes me over the edge.
[02:42:26.394 --> 02:42:37.263]  He's going to attack some, oh a few months of troops on the border, interdicting quote criminals, they'll just bust a few drug dealers that didn't pay the cut into the big banks, and then a bunch of idiots will go back to sleep.
[02:42:40.271 --> 02:42:42.313]  Dave in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:42:42.673 --> 02:42:43.294]  Hi Alex.
[02:42:43.554 --> 02:42:43.755]  Hi.
[02:42:43.775 --> 02:42:46.277]  Hey, I'm sorry about your friend, man, that's a hard thing.
[02:42:46.537 --> 02:42:49.080]  Oh no, it just reminds you how precious life is.
[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:57.388]  Yes it does, and I want you to know that there's a lot of us out here that would be happy to take a bullet for you, and I'm one of them, but I'm not too sure about jumping into a cactus.
[02:42:57.628 --> 02:42:58.589]  I'd have to think about that.
[02:42:58.609 --> 02:43:00.631]  That was a funny, I was in action when that happened, yeah.
[02:43:01.632 --> 02:43:03.714]  Anyway, don't count on me to yell Spider-Man, but
[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:09.102]  But I wanted to say... It was a joke story for those that just joined us about my friend when he was about five.
[02:43:09.402 --> 02:43:12.864]  No, no, he jumped up over a rock in the desert and fell down on a cactus.
[02:43:12.904 --> 02:43:13.104]  Yeah.
[02:43:13.164 --> 02:43:13.984]  Oh, okay.
[02:43:14.525 --> 02:43:16.686]  Well, anyway, yeah, I hope that works out.
[02:43:16.766 --> 02:43:23.069]  And I'm going to say a prayer for him today, and I'm going to give you a little positive stuff real quick today, because sometimes we need to look at it.
[02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:30.232]  I'm not a major Christian fundamentalist type, but I do pray
[02:43:31.165 --> 02:43:39.568]  I'm going to take time out to pray for your friend today, and I'm putting you on my list right underneath my family, so anytime that I sit down... Thank you.
[02:43:39.588 --> 02:43:40.049]  You're welcome.
[02:43:40.329 --> 02:43:43.630]  I want you to know that you're having a really huge effect.
[02:43:44.010 --> 02:43:50.953]  Every place I go online now, anytime I Google anything about 9-11 or the New World Order and all that, you always pop up.
[02:43:51.173 --> 02:43:59.496]  In fact, I Googled some stuff on 9-11 the other day, and everything was, inside job, the government did it, it's just massive.
[02:44:00.431 --> 02:44:05.053]  How widely it's been disseminated on the web, and you have to take a huge amount of credit for that.
[02:44:06.193 --> 02:44:09.054]  Also, you're having a small effect as well.
[02:44:10.174 --> 02:44:11.615]  You woke me up, personally.
[02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:13.015]  I knew a lot of this stuff to begin with.
[02:44:13.035 --> 02:44:15.296]  That's why I moved out to Northern California in the country.
[02:44:15.316 --> 02:44:19.117]  I figured it was a good place to hunker down if things got crazy about 20 years ago.
[02:44:20.078 --> 02:44:24.459]  But I really haven't been watching it as closely as I should have been until I ran into you a few years back.
[02:44:25.174 --> 02:44:37.428]  And the effect you're having on us here locally is that a lot of my friends are awake now, we've got clean water filtered, we've got, you know, some food stashed away, everybody's got weaponry, plenty of ammo, they know how to use it, and they're all...
[02:44:37.955 --> 02:44:42.640]  Basically, we've all partnered up together, so it's going to be a lot harder in all these areas.
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:44.242]  Yeah, that's exactly what we need.
[02:44:44.322 --> 02:44:51.129]  That is worth more than a chest full of gold coins, or a million dollars, is to have good friends, a real community.
[02:44:51.370 --> 02:44:53.672]  There you go, and that's what it's going to come down to.
[02:44:53.712 --> 02:44:58.037]  I mean, that's how people stayed alive back in the old days, and you had to do it all yourself.
[02:45:00.109 --> 02:45:04.291]  And I have one more thing, and I'll let you go, about the Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[02:45:04.371 --> 02:45:11.715]  I know that, I don't know if you're a member, but I know that they support you, and you support them, and you guys are doing stuff together on these conferences.
[02:45:11.975 --> 02:45:21.500]  I would like to suggest that you or one of your folks there at the station join them and get a thread going on the forum.
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:24.881]  They've got a nice members-only forum.
[02:45:24.921 --> 02:45:27.763]  Well, I mean, I've been having them on promoting their thing they're having in
[02:45:29.350 --> 02:45:34.094]  Coming up this second, third, and fourth in Chicago, I have them on every few weeks.
[02:45:34.374 --> 02:45:46.243]  Yep, I know, and I think it's great, and I do see a lot of stuff about you in their forum now, and the stuff that you're saying, and, you know, there's threads on the New World Order and all that, so it's getting out amongst the scholarly folks as well.
[02:45:46.303 --> 02:45:46.564]  Good.
[02:45:47.424 --> 02:45:48.805]  Good to hear from you.
[02:45:48.845 --> 02:45:50.226]  I really appreciate those kind words.
[02:45:50.427 --> 02:45:51.007]  Thank you, Dave.
[02:45:51.407 --> 02:45:52.368]  Tim in Florida.
[02:45:52.388 --> 02:45:53.029]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:45:53.049 --> 02:45:54.510]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:56.631]  I want to say something about 9-11.
[02:45:58.499 --> 02:46:02.441]  But first, have you ever heard the word Zog?
[02:46:02.461 --> 02:46:05.683]  Yeah, it's the Zionist Occupied Government.
[02:46:06.244 --> 02:46:08.545]  Hey, man, not many people know that.
[02:46:10.046 --> 02:46:25.896]  Well, I mean, I think we have a New World Order Occupying Government, and certainly there's the big Israeli lobbies are a big part of that, but I think it limits it to claim that it's Zog, or Zog is what's running everything, but a lot of people think that, and so that's what they want to think, I mean, whatever.
[02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:27.457]  Well, if someone
[02:46:28.226 --> 02:46:34.288]  Who will sacrifice any person, anything, or any nation for the greater good of Israel.
[02:46:36.228 --> 02:46:37.369]  That's what a Zionist is.
[02:46:37.389 --> 02:46:40.610]  Yeah, that would have to be most of our evangelical Christians.
[02:46:41.650 --> 02:46:46.171]  Right, and Christians are in the White House also.
[02:46:47.011 --> 02:46:51.133]  Sir, you know what, that's Bush's job is to make people think Christians are bad.
[02:46:52.193 --> 02:46:54.274]  Bush is not a Christian, he's a Luciferian.
[02:46:54.794 --> 02:46:55.374]  He is, I know.
[02:46:57.161 --> 02:47:13.565]  And you know the crowd that thinks everything's Zog this, Zog that, they say Bush is Jewish, they say I'm Jewish, they say everything's Jewish that isn't, and it just, at a certain point, that's all they do, and you know what, they've been hammering on Israel forever and it doesn't do anything.
[02:47:14.045 --> 02:47:22.847]  I'm against much of what Israel does, because they're run by organized crime, but most Jews in Israel are against what Israel's doing.
[02:47:25.128 --> 02:47:25.668]  You know about
[02:47:26.539 --> 02:47:31.783]  The flash that the airplanes made before they went into the building?
[02:47:31.843 --> 02:47:32.724]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[02:47:33.664 --> 02:47:34.485]  What do you think about that?
[02:47:35.506 --> 02:47:36.927]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:37.227 --> 02:47:45.273]  What I do is I stick to the things that I can totally prove, instead of the things that we can sit around and debate all day.
[02:47:45.733 --> 02:47:51.217]  It gets a lot of publicity, and that's good for people that do that, and I'm sure a lot of it's important.
[02:47:52.450 --> 02:47:55.971]  What I don't like is I've never told anybody what they should or shouldn't cover on 9-11.
[02:47:56.011 --> 02:47:57.272]  I've said, cover whatever you think.
[02:47:58.232 --> 02:48:05.514]  But a lot of the very people that get into that type of stuff and freak out and squeal and squawk, you know, that I won't adopt their views.
[02:48:05.574 --> 02:48:10.096]  And I would just remind them that it's a free country and I'm allowed to have my own views on things.
[02:48:10.156 --> 02:48:17.658]  And I choose to get into the cornucopia of things about 9-11 that most people don't get into.
[02:48:19.810 --> 02:48:21.071]  So, that's what I do there.
[02:48:21.391 --> 02:48:24.432]  And, uh, you know, we can talk about The Flash or P.O.D.S.
[02:48:24.492 --> 02:48:25.712]  or any of that all day if you want.
[02:48:26.232 --> 02:48:27.773]  Truthfully, I don't know what that is.
[02:48:28.333 --> 02:48:29.474]  I don't know what's going on there.
[02:48:32.255 --> 02:48:33.575]  It's just amazing.
[02:48:34.655 --> 02:48:35.656]  Totally unbelievable.
[02:48:35.916 --> 02:48:36.536]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.042]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:46.302 --> 02:48:47.883]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:48.224 --> 02:48:52.867]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:53.247 --> 02:48:57.671]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:48:58.091 --> 02:49:02.294]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:02.494 --> 02:49:05.336]  The Constitution has been shredded and America is now a police state.
[02:49:05.436 --> 02:49:07.898]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:08.118 --> 02:49:14.684]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:14.924 --> 02:49:22.150]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:22.410 --> 02:49:24.832]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:55.475 --> 02:49:58.958]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[02:49:59.238 --> 02:50:03.440]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:03.721 --> 02:50:07.663]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:07.903 --> 02:50:14.407]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:14.647 --> 02:50:20.110]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:20.350 --> 02:50:27.294]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:40.761]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:43.660]  I think so.
[02:50:58.547 --> 02:50:59.207]  We're good to go!
[02:51:28.081 --> 02:51:31.164]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:31.324 --> 02:51:37.309]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:43.153 --> 02:51:46.236]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:51:48.985 --> 02:51:51.466]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:52.267 --> 02:51:54.948]  We'll be here tomorrow with all the coverage of Bush's speech.
[02:51:54.988 --> 02:51:56.689]  We already know what he's going to say.
[02:51:56.709 --> 02:52:00.110]  He's put out some press releases to kind of gauge the public.
[02:52:01.611 --> 02:52:04.352]  And it's just total smoke and mirrors, as I said.
[02:52:04.372 --> 02:52:12.136]  I got a bunch of articles from all over the world, conclusive studies, evidence of especially the cell towers giving you brain cancer.
[02:52:12.576 --> 02:52:15.098]  Building top floors close after brain tumor alert.
[02:52:15.118 --> 02:52:15.798]  The Australian
[02:52:16.804 --> 02:52:26.166]  Newspaper reports, the top floors of Melbourne office building were closed down yesterday after a hundred people evacuated after a seventh worker in many years was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
[02:52:27.286 --> 02:52:29.086]  And it just goes on.
[02:52:29.686 --> 02:52:36.067]  Five academics who work from the top floor and two general staff workers suffered brain tumors since 99.
[02:52:36.707 --> 02:52:41.648]  Six of the seven staff have worked at the Brook Street premises for more than a decade.
[02:52:41.688 --> 02:52:43.389]  Two of these cases were malignant.
[02:52:44.489 --> 02:52:45.529]  And it just goes into that.
[02:52:46.778 --> 02:52:48.178]  I mean, it's a serious problem.
[02:52:48.839 --> 02:52:51.079]  And it's evacuated because the workers are refusing.
[02:52:51.139 --> 02:52:53.160]  The company keeps saying, no, no, no, no.
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:53.900]  It's good for you.
[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:54.460]  It's good.
[02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:55.340]  Not a problem.
[02:52:56.361 --> 02:53:01.722]  And they admit that the cell phone itself up against your head heats the brain, causes brain tumors.
[02:53:01.782 --> 02:53:05.423]  It's just... And we all keep doing it because we're in the habit of doing it.
[02:53:06.964 --> 02:53:07.724]  We've got to stop.
[02:53:08.704 --> 02:53:09.764]  Let's take two final calls.
[02:53:09.844 --> 02:53:11.225]  Dan in New Mexico, then Les.
[02:53:11.345 --> 02:53:11.925]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:13.621]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:13.721 --> 02:53:15.301]  Good to get on your show.
[02:53:15.421 --> 02:53:20.224]  I don't get to catch you live all the time, but I usually catch you in the evening.
[02:53:20.524 --> 02:53:20.904]  Welcome.
[02:53:20.964 --> 02:53:21.785]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:53:22.745 --> 02:53:36.592]  I just wanted to say I got a chance today, so I was listening to you, and I could hear it even before you told them to go to music that you're just about at your wit's end, and we don't want to give them that.
[02:53:37.392 --> 02:53:42.235]  I'm hoping that you've got somebody that can take over the reins for you for a little while.
[02:53:43.387 --> 02:53:47.090]  I've got my best friend from childhood dying, but I'm fine.
[02:53:47.270 --> 02:53:49.072]  I've got Matt talking about the New World Order.
[02:53:49.272 --> 02:53:50.152]  Don't worry about me.
[02:53:50.192 --> 02:53:53.094]  I should never get emotional on air because everybody tries to help me.
[02:53:53.154 --> 02:53:53.875]  I'm great, man.
[02:53:54.315 --> 02:53:54.916]  I'm wonderful.
[02:53:54.936 --> 02:53:55.416]  I'm alive.
[02:53:55.456 --> 02:53:56.597]  I'm sucking air into my lungs.
[02:53:56.917 --> 02:54:00.099]  Yeah, we know it.
[02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:04.302]  Your importance can't be overstated.
[02:54:04.863 --> 02:54:07.365]  You're a great source for all this information.
[02:54:09.622 --> 02:54:16.345]  Those of us out here get concerned when we hear... At the same time, and listen, I really appreciate your call, I gotta go.
[02:54:16.845 --> 02:54:19.406]  But at the same time, we should be angry about what's happening.
[02:54:19.446 --> 02:54:22.607]  We should be, to the point of blowing up, full of anger.
[02:54:22.627 --> 02:54:24.268]  I mean, this is serious stuff.
[02:54:25.208 --> 02:54:25.568]  Okay?
[02:54:25.608 --> 02:54:27.809]  This is serious, serious,
[02:54:29.662 --> 02:54:41.745]  I mean, when people can openly say, we kidnap children by the hundreds of thousands publicly, and you're not going to stop us, and it can be in the front pages of papers, and nobody gets in trouble, we're in deep trouble, okay?
[02:54:42.365 --> 02:54:43.066]  We're in trouble.
[02:54:43.606 --> 02:54:44.626]  I'm sorry to lessen others.
[02:54:44.666 --> 02:54:45.726]  I don't have time to get to you.
[02:54:46.406 --> 02:54:47.627]  I'll be back refocused.
[02:54:49.278 --> 02:54:50.859]  Tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:54:51.239 --> 02:54:53.320]  We had a lot of big guests today, but we had to cancel them.
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:54.541]  Tomorrow they'll be on with us.
[02:54:54.981 --> 02:54:58.183]  We got a South Texas Sheriff about the illegal aliens in the war zone.
[02:54:58.603 --> 02:55:04.646]  I had a bunch of clips about Los Zetas troops shooting at police in the last few days.
[02:55:04.686 --> 02:55:05.346]  I was going to play that.
[02:55:05.366 --> 02:55:06.387]  We'll play it all tomorrow.
[02:55:06.847 --> 02:55:08.108]  Sorry I wasn't here for the first half.
[02:55:08.148 --> 02:55:12.790]  I was at the hospital visiting with some family friends.
[02:55:12.850 --> 02:55:16.812]  They're good friends of mine that have got a very serious problem in the family.
[02:55:17.404 --> 02:55:18.745]  He may even be dead by now.
[02:55:18.765 --> 02:55:20.186]  He's on the verge of death on the left.
[02:55:21.146 --> 02:55:22.647]  But there are some people in the hospital room.
[02:55:22.667 --> 02:55:23.447]  I just got out of there.
[02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:27.389]  Please come to our big 9-11 conference.
[02:55:27.589 --> 02:55:37.555]  We're having there a wide variety of 9-11 angles and things will be discussed by a lot of top scientists and others and surprise guests as well.
[02:55:37.595 --> 02:55:38.235]  Get your tickets.
[02:55:38.795 --> 02:55:39.776]  We're getting close to
[02:55:41.185 --> 02:55:47.151]  30% of the tickets being gone and we're still like 39 days, 40 days away from this event.
[02:55:47.331 --> 02:55:48.393]  It's 39 days.
