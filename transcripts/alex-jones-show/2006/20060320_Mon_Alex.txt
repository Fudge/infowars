[00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:06.238]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:09.766]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:11.189]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:12.877]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:17.179]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:30.763]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:33.444]  Thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:34.685]  The 20th day of March, 2006.
[00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:38.866]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.223]  And there's been a lot of important developments and news stories that have come out, of course, over the weekend.
[00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:46.463]  It always does.
[00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:51.886]  We have a very special guest joining us after this first break that's coming up in about four minutes.
[00:00:52.306 --> 00:01:02.052]  On the anniversary of three years since the invasion of Iraq, Bush and Cheney see Iraq's successes, and they say that Iraq is better off than it was, of course.
[00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:11.998]  Their own CIA reports admit that it is many times worse than it was before the 12 years of sanctions, before the invasion of three years ago.
[00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.761]  The place has basically been knocked back to the Stone Age.
[00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:18.686]  So we'll be getting into that also.
[00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:23.107]  A major move nationwide to impeach President Bush.
[00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:28.248]  It's gained over 45 co-sponsors in the House, now getting sponsors in the Senate.
[00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:34.269]  Multiple states are moving at the state level to vote at their state houses to move for impeachment.
[00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.410]  Places like Vermont and New Hampshire.
[00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:40.344]  And they're getting a big backlash from the neocons on that.
[00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:41.706]  Really scary report.
[00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:45.512]  We already knew this was happening, but here it is, right out of Knight Ridder News Service.
[00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:50.881]  Pentagon hired contractor to advise on collecting information on churches,
[00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:53.339]  Mosque and other U.S.
[00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:53.779]  sites.
[00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.360]  So they've got private contractors illegally spying on us.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.461]  And notice they always focus in on NSA spying.
[00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:00.982]  Only the tip of the old iceberg.
[00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:04.343]  It's much, much worse in this nation.
[00:02:04.383 --> 00:02:08.405]  And it's completely criminal, totally illegal, and Bush and his cohorts is his
[00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:12.106]  His dark horsemen say they don't care, they are the law.
[00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:16.186]  Also, MI5 helped IRA buy bomb parts in the U.S.
[00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:21.828]  This is all the London Times today, and my upcoming film covering a London bombing, that's one aspect of the new documentary I'm making.
[00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.588]  I don't even have a name for it yet, I've been working on it for over six months.
[00:02:25.448 --> 00:02:27.749]  We focus in on British government-sponsored terror.
[00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:37.291]  All of the admissions, they admit they've carried out many of the so-called IRA bombings, and here is more evidence of that today out of the Times of London.
[00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.611]  This and a lot more
[00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.057]  Coming up on the broadcast.
[00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:50.165]  Now, after the break here in a minute or two, we're going to come back and talk to Charlie Sheen for the full hour, for the rest of the hour.
[00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:56.170]  And he's been in over 65 major motion pictures, has a couple more coming out this year.
[00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.917]  Of course, he's the star, the biggest star on one of CBS's hit shows, and that's Two and a Half Men.
[00:03:04.737 --> 00:03:17.746]  And Charlie and I have had a chance to talk some in the last week or so, and he's just got a few issues, a few questions he wants to bring up concerning 9-11 and what's happening here in America.
[00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:23.970]  So believe me, you're not going to want to miss the interview that is coming up after this quick break.
[00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.032]  And you can go to InfoWars.com and we've got links to
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.046]  Uh, the different film databases and, uh, the different fax pages about Mr. Sheen.
[00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:36.691]  Of course, he comes from an activist family, Martin Sheen.
[00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:56.378]  Who is the star of the West Wing and has been immortalized by some of the movie roles that he has played, like Apocalypse Now, has always really stood up first to corruption by the federal government, especially warmongering.
[00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:59.039]  And his son is somewhat of an activist.
[00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.063]  Both of his sons are somewhat of activists in their own right, though not as well known for activism as their father.
[00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:06.064]  Well, I think that
[00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:14.008]  Then in the future you'll be seeing Charlie Sheen standing up more and more to the issues that he's concerned about.
[00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:32.960]  And he'll be doing some of that coming up in the next segment and talk about his hit show, Two and a Half Men, which a lot of people I talked to here in the office before Mr. Sheen was going to come on were really excited because they're big fans of that broadcast that airs every week on CBS.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:46.747]  So we're gonna go to break, we're gonna come back, we're gonna talk to Mr. Sheen for the rest of the hour, and then coming up in the second and third hour, I'll get into all the government-sponsored terror news, the Iraq news, the police state news, here in America, what the secret police are up to, and a lot more.
[00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:54.491]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, and many more.
[00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:54.971]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.252]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.492 --> 00:05:07.094]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:12.099]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:19.186]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:21.466]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:24.507]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:29.288]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:33.889]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.351]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.012]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:08.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:12.100]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.781]  He's been in over 65 major motion pictures, produced them, written them.
[00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:22.442]  From Platoon to Red Dawn, one of my favorites.
[00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.946]  And of course, TV shows like Spin City.
[00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:32.149]  Right now he's the major star on the CBS program Two and a Half Men.
[00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.193]  And he's got several new movies coming out this year and next year.
[00:08:38.153 --> 00:08:41.696]  And when I got a chance to talk to Charlie Sheen, I was just amazed.
[00:08:41.736 --> 00:08:44.057]  Because I've talked to a lot of other big Hollywood people.
[00:08:44.077 --> 00:08:45.198]  We've got a few of them on this show.
[00:08:46.182 --> 00:08:46.543]  Yes, we are.
[00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:05.065]  Really knows what's going on on the planet today, but that shouldn't surprise me.
[00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:08.867]  His father, Martin Sheen, has been on the front lines.
[00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:13.949]  As Mark Twain said in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:19.192]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:21.493]  And, of course, has been proven right time and time again.
[00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:22.174]  It was his father.
[00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:28.495]  In the days leading up to the war, he was the most vocal spokesman in America against this disastrous conflict.
[00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:29.815]  Everything he said has now come true.
[00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:41.037]  And of course, Charlie Sheen and his brother are also activists in their own right, and we are just incredibly honored to have Charlie Sheen on with us for the balance of this hour.
[00:09:41.077 --> 00:09:42.178]  Mr. Sheen, good to have you with us.
[00:09:42.718 --> 00:09:43.578]  Nice to be here, Alex.
[00:09:43.598 --> 00:09:43.998]  How are you?
[00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:45.598]  I'm great.
[00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:49.399]  Before we get into the really serious stuff, tell me a little bit about Two and a Half Men.
[00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.371]  Well, gosh, we're thrilled.
[00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:54.891]  We are at the end of our third season.
[00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:59.732]  We have three more shows to shoot.
[00:09:59.852 --> 00:10:09.415]  Most sitcoms will shoot 22 episodes, but because the network always wants more product, we do 24.
[00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:14.136]  So our season will continue when all the other shows have shut down.
[00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:15.877]  But it's going good.
[00:10:15.917 --> 00:10:16.777]  It's going really good.
[00:10:18.473 --> 00:10:29.761]  We've found ourselves sort of in or around the top ten for most of this year, and we found out we got picked up for next season, which is fabulous.
[00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:43.912]  And what's happening is they're using our show to launch new shows, which is the sign of great confidence and trust in us sort of being the anchor of that Monday night lineup, you know?
[00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:49.388]  So with that, I should probably throw out a shameless plug on tonight's show.
[00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:51.249]  If that's alright.
[00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.650]  Oh sure, tell us about tonight's show.
[00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:55.472]  Tonight's show... I want to hear about it.
[00:10:56.293 --> 00:10:58.874]  It's entitled, The Spit-Covered Cobbler.
[00:10:58.894 --> 00:11:05.178]  And it's funny because the title of our show will always relate to a line of dialogue.
[00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:13.083]  And so, it's about my brother Alan, played by John Cryer, and he's dating a girl who has no money.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.001]  And so, he doesn't have any money himself.
[00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:23.202]  I sort of support him on the show, because I took him in when he went through a divorce with his kid, played by Angus Jones, right?
[00:11:24.302 --> 00:11:29.363]  And so, he's dealing with a woman, April Bowlby, who plays Candy on the show.
[00:11:29.883 --> 00:11:33.283]  And she's fabulous, and she's beautiful, but she's broke.
[00:11:33.623 --> 00:11:34.504]  Imagine that, right?
[00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:40.965]  So, John is forced to pick up the tab for a lot of her bills.
[00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:44.906]  That leads to some pretty funny scenarios.
[00:11:45.568 --> 00:11:47.351]  What time is that showing this evening?
[00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:51.097]  It's on CBS, 9 o'clock, 8 central.
[00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:52.841]  Alright, well I'll have to tune into that.
[00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:55.005]  Now, Mr. Sheen...
[00:11:56.093 --> 00:12:14.770]  You have some questions about the official 9-11 story, and we got hooked up because we both mutually have been looking into that, and I wanted just to, I guess, start by what happened on 9-11, what your instincts told you, and really just go from there.
[00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:20.335]  Well, it was interesting, and let me just preface that by saying that
[00:12:21.772 --> 00:12:48.176]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time and I've been following you and I've seen all of your documentaries and your research is tireless and it's interesting because a lot of these guys you sort of look behind the notes and you start to discover inconsistencies in a lot of the claims that they're making which pretty much torpedoes the credibility of most of their substance but
[00:12:48.948 --> 00:12:51.209]  With you, that's not the case.
[00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:57.713]  And I was always amazed to see that you always had hard data to back up your claims.
[00:12:58.053 --> 00:13:13.941]  And so, you know, this is tough for me because for the longest time I've been doing my own independent research and, you know, I don't claim to be an expert in any of these fields, but just as a concerned
[00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:43.912]  uh... job upstanding tax-paying american citizen there's just uh... there's questions i have uh... that i wish somebody could uh... explain away for me there's things that that one will will view and then look at the the king commission's official report and it just uh... as i heard someone say might have been you uh... there's holes in the story you could fly a boeing jet through
[00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.790]  Oh, there certainly is.
[00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:52.352]  In fact, we were talking yesterday and you said over the phone that the biggest conspiracy theory is the official story.
[00:13:52.392 --> 00:13:55.692]  I mean, at every point, it's a fabrication.
[00:13:56.012 --> 00:13:56.572]  It's a lie.
[00:13:56.612 --> 00:13:57.533]  Would you elaborate on that?
[00:13:58.413 --> 00:13:58.813]  Well, yeah.
[00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:06.194]  It's like they want to just pigeonhole all of us into this group of conspiracy nutbags.
[00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:09.695]  When we're not really debating things that are
[00:14:10.643 --> 00:14:17.645]  Related to UFOs, uh, bringing down the towers, or Building 7, or the Pentagon, right?
[00:14:17.785 --> 00:14:33.950]  And so, um, it just, um, you know, it just feels like, um, you know, there's, there's things in there that, that, we're not the conspiracy theorists on this particular issue, you know?
[00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.592]  It seems to me like, you know, 19 amateurs with box cutters
[00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:44.246]  Taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets?
[00:14:45.146 --> 00:14:46.746]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:51.907]  Well, I tell you, back in 2001, everybody admits that cell phones didn't work over 3,000 feet.
[00:14:51.927 --> 00:14:53.628]  How were they working at 33,000, 32,000 feet?
[00:14:53.688 --> 00:14:57.629]  How did Al-Qaeda make NORAD stand down?
[00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:03.310]  Did Al-Qaeda call Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, as the Chronicle reported, and say, don't fly to New York?
[00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.410]  No, the White House did.
[00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.073]  Did Al Qaeda call Salman Rushdie and say don't fly to New York on September 11th?
[00:15:09.113 --> 00:15:11.734]  No, the Times of London reported that the White House did.
[00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:22.921]  Did Al Qaeda run drills, CIA and Pentagon drills on the morning of 9-11 of hijacked jets hitting those exact same targets at those exact same times and then drills the day before and drills two weeks before?
[00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:27.744]  Yeah, the answer to that would be probably not.
[00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:46.347]  No, it's just that the more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events around the fateful day, it just raises a lot of questions.
[00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:55.773]  There's a lot of questions, and I know that a couple of years ago it was severely unpopular to discuss any of this.
[00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:07.219]  But it sort of feels like, just in my research and in the people that I talk to and in and around my circles, it seems like the worm is turning.
[00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:20.624]  Because you start talking about this, even with conservative Republicans, and they can't really debate away some of the most obvious facts.
[00:16:22.037 --> 00:16:22.598]  On that day.
[00:16:22.778 --> 00:16:24.899]  Let me ask my radio producer a question.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.421]  Did you find that clip of Dan Rather?
[00:16:28.742 --> 00:16:35.688]  Let me just roll this little 30 second clip because this is what Dan Rather thought about 20 seconds after Building 7 collapsed.
[00:16:36.048 --> 00:16:38.990]  They backed the tape up and played it and this is what he said live.
[00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.671]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.453]  Again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[00:16:44.314 --> 00:16:47.396]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[00:16:48.237 --> 00:16:50.339]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:55.304]  It's an amazing, incredible picture work.
[00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:07.089]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:11.950]  All right, so there's Dan Rather, and that's what I thought that morning.
[00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:17.232]  That's what engineers, the heads of engineering colleges, that's what a lot of people said.
[00:17:18.112 --> 00:17:19.493]  Charlie, what did you think on that morning?
[00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:24.276]  Well, where do we start?
[00:17:24.556 --> 00:17:33.122]  I was up early, actually, and we were going to do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do.
[00:17:34.643 --> 00:17:42.388]  And so, gosh, I was up, and I was watching the news, and the North Tower was burning.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:50.763]  And so, you know, the world was focused on what I guess they were assuming to be pilot error, right?
[00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.545]  Or some tragedy nobody could really explain.
[00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:57.727]  And so I saw the South Tower hit live.
[00:17:59.007 --> 00:18:03.509]  That famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building, and then we see the tremendous fireball, you know?
[00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:10.833]  And there was just a feeling that it just didn't look...
[00:18:12.671 --> 00:18:13.351]  How do I say this?
[00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:20.374]  It didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.
[00:18:21.554 --> 00:18:32.579]  And then when the buildings came down, later on that day, I was with my brother, I was at my parents' house, and we were out on the deck, and I said, hey, call me insane.
[00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:38.921]  But did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[00:18:39.747 --> 00:18:46.049]  And he said, well, kind of, but gosh, that's impossible if you think about what it would take for them to orchestrate that.
[00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:54.171]  And so, as the days and the weeks went on, I was sort of told what to believe.
[00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:58.312]  And I was told through mainstream media and all of the talking heads,
[00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:00.152]  About what really happened.
[00:19:00.392 --> 00:19:03.513]  Not only when the press, when the press, you know, here's your interview.
[00:19:04.254 --> 00:19:10.817]  If they think it's radical that you thought it looked like explosives, they better go talk to Dan Rather than the host of CBS Nightly News.
[00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:14.699]  And we also have a clip of Peter Jennings saying the exact same thing twice.
[00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:22.463]  So he says it looks like bombs, so I guess they'll have to dig up poor Peter Jennings and gripe at him for thinking the same thing that you and I thought.
[00:19:22.943 --> 00:19:26.105]  Of course, but what bothers me even more about all of this is that
[00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:29.367]  All of this stuff exists from day one.
[00:19:29.387 --> 00:19:41.336]  If you start looking at all of the news reporting after day one, the official story starts to find its way into our consciousness.
[00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:43.498]  They start telling us the conspiracy theory.
[00:19:43.518 --> 00:19:47.161]  The conspiracy theorists in the government start telling us their wild-eyed conspiracies.
[00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:48.339]  Exactly.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.620]  Exactly.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.783]  And so we all go away from what we felt in our guts initially.
[00:19:54.183 --> 00:19:55.424]  Charlie Sheen, stay right there.
[00:19:55.464 --> 00:19:56.164]  We've got a break.
[00:19:56.184 --> 00:19:57.065]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.485 --> 00:19:58.546]  Folks, strap yourselves in.
[00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.933]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:04.993 --> 00:20:09.176]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:12.198]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:14.800]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.647]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:25.188]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:20:25.368 --> 00:20:29.531]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:30.291]  We're good to go!
[00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:53.106]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:56.109]  Moedis Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.

[00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.714]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards,
[00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:20.746]  Learn the stability of real money.
[00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:23.228]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:21:23.628 --> 00:21:25.169]  They are instruments of death.
[00:21:25.429 --> 00:21:27.470]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.311]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:11.974]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[00:22:12.854 --> 00:22:17.456]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office?
[00:22:17.656 --> 00:22:25.959]  We continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:28.341]  The handwriting is on the wall.
[00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:37.049]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:49.248 --> 00:22:50.049]  516-8736.

[00:23:01.056 --> 00:23:03.117]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:23:03.337 --> 00:23:05.579]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:06.560]  New toenails?
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.920]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:23:08.901 --> 00:23:11.583]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy-looking.
[00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.540]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.342]  They were so discolored and really awful looking.
[00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.944]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:20.065]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:21.587]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:24.449]  Look, this one looks white and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:25.910]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.511]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:27.992 --> 00:23:32.075]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:33.676]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:36.478]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:38.380]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.963]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:42.904]  You bet!
[00:23:43.124 --> 00:23:47.228]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[00:23:47.368 --> 00:23:48.889]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:50.430]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:50.611 --> 00:23:52.272]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:57.717]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[00:23:57.937 --> 00:23:58.958]  In the foot care section.
[00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:18.421]  No, we're not backing down.
[00:24:19.482 --> 00:24:20.763]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:26.429]  There are those attempting to break down the sovereignty and the freedoms that are in this country, and they're failing.
[00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:30.693]  More and more Americans, as Charlie Sheen said, are waking up.
[00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.195]  The worm has turned.
[00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:40.397]  And I was talking to Charlie yesterday and I talked about how when I brought up my facts on 9-11 just days after it happened, a lot of people disagree with me.
[00:24:40.477 --> 00:24:44.822]  Now, not just on my own broadcast, but on so many other shows, really no one calls in to disagree.
[00:24:44.842 --> 00:24:49.126]  Many of you as listeners in your local area have heard me on your local station with a talk show host attacking me.
[00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:54.528]  And everyone calls into my defense, so people instinctively know that something is wrong.
[00:24:55.008 --> 00:24:56.509]  And 9-11 is just part of that.
[00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:05.813]  We're talking to, of course, a legendary actor, star of screen and of course television, poet and writer, you name it, and Charlie Sheen.
[00:25:05.833 --> 00:25:08.674]  Charlie, there's so many facets to 9-11, but what about WTC7?
[00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:12.328]  I mean, it wasn't even hit by a building.
[00:25:12.348 --> 00:25:15.408]  47-story structure, has two small fires in it.
[00:25:16.008 --> 00:25:18.809]  A modern steel building that never collapsed from fire.
[00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:25.430]  The Madrid fire last year, it burned for two days with 150 something foot white hot flames and nothing collapsed there.
[00:25:25.831 --> 00:25:27.411]  What happened with Building 7 in your opinion?
[00:25:28.031 --> 00:25:28.971]  Well, curious, isn't it?
[00:25:29.972 --> 00:25:30.932]  It's a little bit curious.
[00:25:31.272 --> 00:25:35.593]  It just seems odd that an event
[00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:46.666]  Uh, something that we all witnessed because, um, September 11th wasn't the Zapruder Film, it was the Zapruder Film Festival, okay?
[00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:55.812]  And I think that, um, what was the great, uh, Hoover quote about the bigger the lie,
[00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.089]  The easier it is to pass over on people?
[00:25:58.329 --> 00:25:58.610]  Yes.
[00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.451]  I mangled it.
[00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:00.891]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:26:00.931 --> 00:26:01.231]  Well, no.
[00:26:01.272 --> 00:26:04.274]  Hitler had a similar one about the bigger the lie, the more they'll buy it.
[00:26:04.654 --> 00:26:04.954]  Sure.
[00:26:05.014 --> 00:26:05.514]  There you go.
[00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:06.335]  There you go.
[00:26:06.355 --> 00:26:17.503]  Let me just throw out a quote just because, you know, we're 20 minutes into this and I'm sure I'm being demonized across the nation by, you know, all of the people that do that sort of thing.
[00:26:18.183 --> 00:26:21.346]  But people see through the propaganda organs now like they never have before.
[00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:22.166]  Well, good.
[00:26:22.627 --> 00:26:22.907]  Good.
[00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:23.487]  Finally.
[00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:25.469]  There's a couple of quotes here.
[00:26:26.573 --> 00:26:32.658]  The first is, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the President or anyone else.
[00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:44.007]  The second quote from the same gentleman is, uh, that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.
[00:26:44.467 --> 00:26:45.308]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:47.670]  Yes, well that's what the Founding Fathers said.
[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.231]  It's our job to be watchdogs.
[00:26:49.251 --> 00:26:53.695]  The Declaration of Independence clearly states that in our seminal founding document.
[00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:55.076]  Absolutely.
[00:26:55.532 --> 00:27:01.920]  Yeah, and we've been coerced away from these founding principles.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:09.969]  We've been told you're either with us or you're with the terrorists, and we've been told never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning 9-11.
[00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:11.351]  Bush said that at the UN.
[00:27:11.811 --> 00:27:12.232]  Yes, he did.
[00:27:12.842 --> 00:27:13.362]  Yes, he did.
[00:27:13.422 --> 00:27:17.503]  That would direct the blame away from those responsible, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:18.783 --> 00:27:20.864]  Back to Building 7, yeah.
[00:27:21.044 --> 00:27:31.387]  You pointed out in one of your documentaries that in a classic controlled demolition that they create what's first called a crease, is that correct?
[00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:32.467]  Or a wrinkle?
[00:27:33.247 --> 00:27:36.268]  A crease, wrinkle, cramp, all those are used, yes.
[00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:37.428]  They blow the central column.
[00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:40.929]  Right, and the term pull is about pulling
[00:27:41.613 --> 00:27:44.115]  The outer walls toward the center of the building, correct?
[00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:44.476]  Yes.
[00:27:46.318 --> 00:27:50.802]  So you minimize the damage, and that way you bring a building down on its own footprint.
[00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:52.563]  Correct.
[00:27:52.663 --> 00:27:56.687]  And many controlled demolition experts said they've never seen a prettier job than Building 7.
[00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:57.989]  Yeah, gosh.
[00:27:58.149 --> 00:28:02.513]  And there was a guy, I can't remember his name, but scientifically he broke down
[00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:10.252]  That the building actually fell faster than the speed of gravity because of the explosive vacuum that was created.
[00:28:10.832 --> 00:28:22.296]  Well, a lot of different physicists, a physics professor at BYU, Stephen Jones has done that, Underwriting Laboratories, Kevin Ryan, who was there.
[00:28:22.436 --> 00:28:23.657]  That guy got fired, right?
[00:28:23.897 --> 00:28:26.358]  Yes, he said we did our own test, and it's impossible.
[00:28:26.398 --> 00:28:28.798]  Steel doesn't melt until thousands of degrees.
[00:28:29.298 --> 00:28:32.259]  Around 3,000 it weakens, and jet fuel burns at 1,200 to 1,400.
[00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:33.520]  It's impossible.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.860]  Well, that's 1,200 at optimum conditions, right?
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:37.421]  Yes.
[00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:47.783]  Yeah, and then you've got Silverstein, the leaseholder, the owner of 7, as well as the rest of the complex, right?
[00:28:49.224 --> 00:28:50.724]  On tape, on the record,
[00:28:51.465 --> 00:28:51.846]  Same.
[00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:57.975]  We've had such a terrible loss of life that day and I made the decision that they should go ahead and pull it.
[00:28:58.216 --> 00:29:00.058]  And we gave the order and watched the building come down?
[00:29:00.459 --> 00:29:00.720]  Yeah.
[00:29:02.168 --> 00:29:08.752]  Well, pull is the... I mean, that's his... That's his comment to the demo world as action and cut to the movie world.
[00:29:08.972 --> 00:29:24.362]  In fact, in the same PBS documentary, uh, narrated by Kevin Spacey, or not Kevin Spacey, the other guy, uh, he comes right out and says, uh, they cut to one of the other, uh, uh, engineers demoing a building, and he says, we're getting ready to pull it.
[00:29:25.262 --> 00:29:25.903]  And then they pull it.
[00:29:25.923 --> 00:29:29.105]  We're gonna come back, in fact, and play, uh, some of those clips.
[00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:30.946]  On the other side,
[00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:33.324]  of this quick break.
[00:29:33.384 --> 00:29:37.286]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:37.306 --> 00:29:39.607]  We're talking to Charlie Sheen.
[00:29:40.047 --> 00:29:44.769]  We're very honored to have him, and of course I'm flattered that he likes the documentaries.
[00:29:45.089 --> 00:29:45.510]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.453 --> 00:29:52.393]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:54.454]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.355 --> 00:29:58.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.482 --> 00:30:02.584]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:04.707]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:30:04.727 --> 00:30:06.209]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:06.650]  Yes.
[00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:07.792]  You neglect me.
[00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.955]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:30:11.778 --> 00:30:12.800]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.002]  I'm getting sick.
[00:30:14.322 --> 00:30:16.506]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:18.027]  Wait a minute.
[00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:19.747]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:28.532]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:30:28.992 --> 00:30:34.455]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:30:34.675 --> 00:30:37.076]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:41.901]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:43.763]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:30:43.963 --> 00:30:47.286]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[00:31:12.744 --> 00:31:17.047]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:31:17.387 --> 00:31:20.389]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.132]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:31:24.472 --> 00:31:33.819]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:37.581]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:37.822 --> 00:31:44.927]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:08.271]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:13.493]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:13.813 --> 00:32:21.736]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:28.919]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:30.341]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:33.886]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:33.946 --> 00:32:35.067]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:35.368 --> 00:32:36.630]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:43.679]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.223]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:32:49.424 --> 00:32:50.444]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.484 --> 00:32:53.865]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:56.405]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:18.214]  Well, he comes from a family of actors and he's one of the most accomplished.
[00:33:18.234 --> 00:33:19.354]  He's Charlie Sheen.
[00:33:20.095 --> 00:33:21.135]  They're also activists.
[00:33:22.676 --> 00:33:26.538]  And he has starred in over 65 major films and a couple new ones coming out this year.
[00:33:26.578 --> 00:33:34.802]  And of course, he'll be on tonight at 8 o'clock Central Time on CBS for Two and a Half Men, which he is the main star of the show on.
[00:33:35.442 --> 00:33:42.926]  But he joins us today to talk about, well, just the state of the world and some of the interesting things that are happening and some of the foundational events that are the
[00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:46.255]  Pretext for our new way of life.
[00:33:46.896 --> 00:33:48.217]  America changed, they told us.
[00:33:48.257 --> 00:33:49.378]  Give up all your freedoms.
[00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:53.963]  Freedom equals safety or security.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.921]  What's the new definition of freedom?
[00:33:57.941 --> 00:34:00.082]  It's surveillance and not having freedom.
[00:34:00.142 --> 00:34:03.063]  So it's a lot of double-speak and double-think.
[00:34:03.243 --> 00:34:05.664]  And Charlie Sheen again is our guest.
[00:34:06.005 --> 00:34:07.245]  I want to play a clip.
[00:34:07.305 --> 00:34:14.088]  He mentioned this clip from America Rebuilds, a 2002 PBS documentary.
[00:34:14.249 --> 00:34:16.570]  And it is narrated by Kevin Spacey.
[00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.872]  And here is Larry Silverstein, the owner who took out $7 million of insurance on the two towers.
[00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:25.214]  And he's also now bought the Sears Tower and taken out a bunch of insurance.
[00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:33.458]  Governor Pataki just called him the lowest of the low in the newspaper because he's holding out for a billion more now.
[00:34:33.858 --> 00:34:39.641]  Interesting fellow, made out quite well, and here is his statement from America Rebuilds.
[00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:46.585]  I remember getting a call from the fighter bomber commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:34:48.205 --> 00:34:50.166]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:53.108]  Maybe this one has induced this pullet.
[00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:59.594]  Uh, they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[00:35:00.035 --> 00:35:02.336]  They made the decision to pull.
[00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:03.537]  They made.
[00:35:04.097 --> 00:35:05.278]  They made the decision.
[00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:22.459]  And this building with two small fires implodes perfectly, and then there's video from every angle of the squibs, or the blast points, where the plastic explosives are detonating, and you see the ejection ports, you see the blast points, just like when you watch a Las Vegas demolition.
[00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:25.060]  They just had a demolition over the weekend in Fort Worth.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.981]  We have video and photos of that up on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:28.982]  Fell just like seven.
[00:35:29.242 --> 00:35:30.883]  The blast, the squibs,
[00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:36.664]  Then the crimp in the middle, the top of the building imploding downwards, and then it falls in on itself.
[00:35:37.804 --> 00:35:43.145]  Going back to our guest, Mr. Sheen, that is the clip you mentioned with Mr. Silverstein.
[00:35:43.565 --> 00:35:45.546]  Yes it is, yeah.
[00:35:46.046 --> 00:35:47.846]  Let me just play devil's advocate for a second, right?
[00:35:51.327 --> 00:35:54.847]  Again, I don't claim to be an expert about structural integrity.
[00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:56.968]  I don't claim to be an expert about demolitions.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:07.089]  Could they have rigged that building during the day when they decided that the fire was out of hand, even though it was only in a couple of floors?
[00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:07.650]  No way!
[00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.612]  They could have blown the whole thing to bits!
[00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:15.824]  With just a mass of explosives down low, but they couldn't engage in precision demolitions.
[00:36:15.844 --> 00:36:16.464]  It would take weeks.
[00:36:16.905 --> 00:36:17.505]  Okay, good.
[00:36:17.725 --> 00:36:18.126]  Good to know.
[00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:19.046]  That's what I think.
[00:36:19.287 --> 00:36:24.331]  But again, I'm just throwing stuff out that somebody might present as a viable argument.
[00:36:24.471 --> 00:36:28.354]  Well, the engineers that have looked at it, who are on government payroll, have said just what you're saying.
[00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:31.557]  The heads of mining colleges, the heads of physics departments,
[00:36:31.977 --> 00:36:36.581]  Let me ask you though, how long did it take to start an investigation after Pearl Harbor?
[00:37:01.488 --> 00:37:02.009]  About a day.
[00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:04.711]  Okay, uh, the Titanic.
[00:37:05.792 --> 00:37:06.773]  It started that day.
[00:37:07.613 --> 00:37:08.274]  Uh, JFK.
[00:37:08.995 --> 00:37:09.635]  Started that day.
[00:37:10.116 --> 00:37:11.537]  Yeah, uh, 9-11?
[00:37:12.538 --> 00:37:13.899]  Started about a year later.
[00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:14.820]  Yeah.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.584]  Yeah, and then the investigation was ordered to be limited in its scope.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:28.987]  Well, they had armed guards over every piece of steel and put GPS equipment on each piece, and if a guy pulled over to get a hamburger for ten minutes, he'd be fired and then criminally charged.
[00:37:29.027 --> 00:37:32.149]  That's what they actually did, and they shipped it to China under guard.
[00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:42.837]  Yeah, well, that bothers me because Giuliani, as a former prosecutor, knows the value of evidence preservation and crime scene preservation.
[00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:54.534]  I understand that they were on the clock, and they were still looking for victims, and they were still looking for bodies, and they were still hoping, beyond hope, that there were survivors, but... But not a week into it, not a month into it.
[00:37:55.134 --> 00:37:55.915]  No, I know.
[00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:57.015]  I know.
[00:37:57.335 --> 00:38:06.458]  So, the thing that I can't get my mind off of is that if there's a problem with Building 7, there's a problem with the whole thing.
[00:38:07.273 --> 00:38:07.793]  Well, you're right.
[00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:09.674]  What about firefighters on record?
[00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:17.419]  Major newspapers say they found three of the voice recorders, data recorders, and then the FBI said, don't tell anybody about this, and shipped them off.
[00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:20.480]  Yeah, and we've never had access to that data, have we?
[00:38:20.781 --> 00:38:21.001]  No.
[00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:21.881]  No.
[00:38:23.002 --> 00:38:28.465]  Yeah, just the fact that the entire event is so shrouded in secrecy.
[00:38:28.505 --> 00:38:33.287]  They ordered the FAA to destroy the tapes as well, the tapes they recorded at the towers.
[00:38:34.908 --> 00:38:35.269]  Yeah.
[00:38:37.725 --> 00:38:37.985]  I know.
[00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:44.391]  Again, I'm not coming on your show to say I know who did it, I know how they did it, and I know why they did it.
[00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:54.920]  I'm just coming on to talk about what we've been told as a public, and again, a lot of it is pretty
[00:38:57.717 --> 00:38:59.358]  Silly, for lack of a better term.
[00:39:00.178 --> 00:39:01.858]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:39:01.898 --> 00:39:03.699]  We know there hasn't been a real investigation.
[00:39:03.739 --> 00:39:04.959]  In fact, there's been a cover-up.
[00:39:05.439 --> 00:39:08.240]  And when you normally see a cover-up going on, that's pretty suspicious.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.061]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:12.341]  Let me ask you this, though.
[00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:23.185]  Everybody's now familiar with the famous Andrew Card Bush ear-whisperer at the elementary school.
[00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:33.579]  That whole incident is problematic to me, because as we talked about yesterday, it was broadcast three days in advance, um, his schedule, correct?
[00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:34.359]  The President's schedule?
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:34.860]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:35.401 --> 00:39:41.267]  Yes, so, conservatively, um, if that event was being broadcast live, right?
[00:39:41.767 --> 00:39:41.988]  Yes.
[00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:47.934]  How many people in the state of Florida knew where the President was at that specific point in time?
[00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:53.612]  Basically, the entire population that watched the TV news, it was a big event.
[00:39:54.112 --> 00:40:02.961]  Okay, alright, so... If, in fact, he was being informed that the second plane had hit, America's under attack, right?
[00:40:03.361 --> 00:40:03.962]  Isn't he then...
[00:40:05.515 --> 00:40:09.676]  Putting everybody in his immediate circle at great risk?
[00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:12.157]  Including that school full of elementary students?
[00:40:12.637 --> 00:40:13.618]  That's what I'm talking about, yeah.
[00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:23.341]  Yeah, so it would seem to me that upon the revelation of that news that the Secret Service would grab the President and remove him
[00:40:24.725 --> 00:40:27.386]  As if he were on fire from that room.
[00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:28.206]  Well, you're right.
[00:40:28.286 --> 00:40:32.087]  And he was only about ten minutes away from a major airport.
[00:40:32.107 --> 00:40:35.688]  I mean, and they were saying they thought there were hijackers all over the country.
[00:40:35.728 --> 00:40:38.269]  And everyone's in incredible fear.
[00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:47.931]  But, oh, George Bush, he just sits there after he's told the second plane has hit for around twenty minutes and then kind of just ambles out, taking his time.
[00:40:48.471 --> 00:40:53.416]  Of course, some Secret Service did say, let's get him out, and then Card and others just said, no, we're going to stay.
[00:40:53.456 --> 00:40:54.316]  I wonder what they knew.
[00:40:54.336 --> 00:41:01.763]  It's funny, Jeb Bush declared martial law three days before, too, and that was kind of kept just a little bit quiet as well.
[00:41:02.264 --> 00:41:03.525]  Did Jeb Bush ever explain why?
[00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:06.867]  No, he wouldn't say why, and Bush wouldn't say why.
[00:41:06.887 --> 00:41:09.909]  They had massed 44,000 U.S.
[00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:22.618]  troops, 18,000 British troops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and had carrier attack groups about to launch their attacks on Afghanistan, and he had that order signed on his desk just waiting two days before 9-11.
[00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:30.383]  That was incredibly convenient to have your whole military stacked up and ready to go into Afghanistan, something that took about six months to build up, I'm told.
[00:41:31.485 --> 00:41:34.587]  Yeah, because you don't really put those strategies together overnight, do you?
[00:41:34.607 --> 00:41:38.490]  For a major invasion, no.
[00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.872]  No, those are really well calculated and really well planned.
[00:41:42.813 --> 00:41:43.814]  At least from this government.
[00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:46.075]  Well, you're right.
[00:41:48.237 --> 00:41:49.057]  But let me ask you this.
[00:41:50.618 --> 00:41:58.384]  In a statement that the President made following, I think it was a school kid that asked him, what did you think when the first plane hit?
[00:41:59.733 --> 00:42:05.657]  And he said something to the effect of, I was watching it on TV like everybody else, and I thought, oh gosh, that's pilot error.
[00:42:05.917 --> 00:42:06.238]  Correct?
[00:42:06.538 --> 00:42:06.818]  Yes.
[00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:12.382]  So, I guess one of the perks of being president is you get access to TV channels
[00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:15.526]  That don't exist in the known universe, correct?
[00:42:16.006 --> 00:42:16.386]  That's right.
[00:42:16.426 --> 00:42:21.970]  He said, yeah, I saw it on TV, the first plane hit, and I thought, that guy's gotta be a terrible pilot.
[00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:29.555]  Then, his spokesman, a day later, because the San Francisco Cronkle did the whole timeline, his spokesman said, no, he never saw that, he didn't mean that.
[00:42:30.373 --> 00:42:42.355]  He wasn't even aware the first building had been hit when he went out to give the speech, but then the Times of London and AP had photos of him watching the first tower smoking after it had been announced there in the green room.
[00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:43.896]  So we also have a lot of lying going on.
[00:42:45.076 --> 00:42:55.838]  Yeah, it um... I mean it might lead you to believe that he'd seen similar images in some type of a
[00:42:57.117 --> 00:42:57.698]  Rehearsal.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.380]  As it were.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.102]  Yes.
[00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:11.570]  What did you think of the guns being taken from the pilots just a few months before in July, the federal law being changed by Bush so pilots couldn't carry firearms?
[00:43:12.611 --> 00:43:13.712]  That's a little convenient, isn't it?
[00:43:15.473 --> 00:43:20.958]  Because that was instituted post-Cuban Missile Crisis, correct?
[00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:21.439]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:22.039 --> 00:43:23.681]  Yeah, so that had been in place for almost 40 years.
[00:43:26.272 --> 00:43:33.468]  It's, you know, it's right in there with, I guess it was June or July of 2001, when after 46 years, Cheney changed
[00:43:37.268 --> 00:43:39.029]  The authorization for the shoot-down orders.
[00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:40.210]  Oh, that's right.
[00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:47.316]  Since NORAD was set up in the late fifties, generals and admirals had standing shoot-down orders of errant aircraft like Payne Stewart.
[00:43:47.336 --> 00:43:49.277]  They were ready in that case a few years before.
[00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:57.123]  But magically, he took the power away from all the generals and only gave it to himself and to his adjunct, the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:43:58.724 --> 00:43:59.004]  Yeah.
[00:43:59.104 --> 00:44:06.350]  No, again, you know, I'm not on your show to say who did it or why, because I don't have those answers.
[00:44:06.954 --> 00:44:10.535]  Yeah, we just shouldn't have an investigation by their very people that turns out to be a whitewash.
[00:44:10.575 --> 00:44:19.139]  I mean, the 9-11 Commission, we talked yesterday about how the Commission claimed there weren't even support pillars in the middle of Tower 1 and 2 when it had the biggest columns in the world up until that time.
[00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:20.859]  Yeah, it had how many?
[00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:20.859]  47.
[00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:23.660]  47, that's right, yeah.
[00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:35.445]  And it would seem to me, just based on what we've all seen, those images that are indelibly emblazoned into our memories forever, again,
[00:44:36.129 --> 00:44:50.815]  I don't have experience in avionics or high-rise mechanics, but it looked like the majority of the jet fuel, upon impact, exploded.
[00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:51.555]  Yes, it did.
[00:44:54.344 --> 00:45:08.256]  I have a hard time believing that a fireball traveled down the elevator over 1100 feet and still had the explosive energy to destroy the lobby like it was described.
[00:45:08.636 --> 00:45:16.023]  Well we can fill a two hour film just with quick cuts of different firefighters and police saying they saw bombs going off.
[00:45:16.563 --> 00:45:24.988]  But then they were told to shut up, and then they did these after-action video reports with the firemen and police, and then the government declared national security on those tapes.
[00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:26.949]  Then they declared that they were destroyed.
[00:45:27.269 --> 00:45:29.570]  Then with a congressional order, some got released.
[00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.891]  And what are the firemen and police saying on the tapes?
[00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:34.973]  That they saw bombs going off in all three of the buildings.
[00:45:35.788 --> 00:45:42.672]  Yeah, and this one guy in that famous clip talks about it looked like one of those, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, controlled detonations.
[00:45:42.712 --> 00:45:43.393]  We have that clip.
[00:45:43.433 --> 00:45:45.074]  Now, there's two in the computer, John, so be careful.
[00:45:45.174 --> 00:45:46.895]  One hasn't been edited and has the cussing.
[00:45:47.155 --> 00:45:47.795]  Don't air that one.
[00:45:47.815 --> 00:45:48.175]  Be careful.
[00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:49.736]  Last time we almost had a mistake.
[00:45:50.197 --> 00:45:54.459]  Can you find the one where the firefighters are saying, it looked as if they had detonators?
[00:45:54.479 --> 00:45:55.500]  Are you talking about that one?
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.221]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:05.323]  And then now there are films that have come out, and of course I have all these clips, but there are films that just have an hour and a half of just that, Charlie.
[00:46:05.703 --> 00:46:05.963]  Yeah.
[00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:07.604]  Of just different firemen saying that.
[00:46:08.164 --> 00:46:15.966]  Sure, and again, this is not you and I watching the video, you know, speculating about what we think we saw.
[00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:21.247]  These are gentlemen, you know, inside the buildings,
[00:46:22.704 --> 00:46:25.926]  At the very point of collapse.
[00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:27.167]  Let's go ahead and roll that next clip.
[00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:27.507]  Here it is.
[00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:28.048]  Sure.
[00:46:28.088 --> 00:46:28.868]  We made it outside.
[00:46:28.908 --> 00:46:30.469]  We made it about a block.
[00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:32.331]  We made it at least two blocks.
[00:46:32.511 --> 00:46:34.632]  And we started running.
[00:46:34.673 --> 00:46:36.394]  Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[00:46:36.454 --> 00:46:38.756]  It was just, it had detonated.
[00:46:38.776 --> 00:46:41.157]  Yeah, it detonated.
[00:46:41.237 --> 00:46:42.218]  Yeah.
[00:46:42.358 --> 00:46:42.899]  All the way down.
[00:46:42.939 --> 00:46:44.220]  I was watching it, and we're on it.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.320]  It just ran upwind.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.303]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of **** chasing you down.
[00:46:49.003 --> 00:46:49.624]  Could not run it.
[00:46:49.645 --> 00:46:51.428]  Could not run it.
[00:46:51.488 --> 00:46:54.593]  I jumped behind a battalion car, I hit under the car, I was squinting to die.
[00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:56.536]  So...
[00:46:58.797 --> 00:47:00.618]  Mr. Sheen, what do you think we should do then?
[00:47:00.658 --> 00:47:02.419]  I mean, this is a citizen, you have that right.
[00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:03.700]  What do you think we should do?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.501]  I mean, what type of, what would be a real investigation?
[00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:07.762]  What would satisfy you?
[00:47:08.042 --> 00:47:20.969]  Who, according to most Americans in major polls, a CNN poll 90%, a Zogby poll 49%, take whatever poll you want, but more than half of Americans in major polls want some type of real investigation.
[00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:21.790]  What would you like to see?
[00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.851]  I would like to see the same thing.
[00:47:23.871 --> 00:47:24.732]  I think it's got to be
[00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:34.446]  It's got to be headed by, if this is possible, some neutral investigative committee.
[00:47:37.212 --> 00:47:37.733]  I don't know...
[00:47:38.763 --> 00:47:41.125]  Exactly how to establish that.
[00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:44.148]  Well the problem is... You would know more about that than I would.
[00:47:44.348 --> 00:47:48.371]  Well the problem is they tried to again appoint Henry Kissinger and they called him independent.
[00:47:48.852 --> 00:47:53.575]  It was like appointing one of Janet Reno's deputies to investigate Waco and calling it independent.
[00:47:54.016 --> 00:47:55.157]  What would be independent?
[00:47:55.737 --> 00:48:04.004]  Maybe just randomly pick 20 engineers or something and then draft them for a committee and then make sure no one tried to intimidate the witnesses.
[00:48:04.024 --> 00:48:05.906]  I mean maybe just a jury of the peers.
[00:48:07.006 --> 00:48:11.817]  What if we use retired political foreign nationals?
[00:48:12.298 --> 00:48:15.406]  What if we use experts that don't have any ties whatsoever?
[00:48:16.027 --> 00:48:16.928]  To this administration.
[00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:22.711]  Well, Michael Meacher, number three in the Blair government, says that he believes the government may be behind it.
[00:48:23.091 --> 00:48:27.654]  And then we have Andres von Bulow, the former German defense minister, saying the same thing.
[00:48:28.134 --> 00:48:32.217]  And a bunch of other Russian and other foreign leaders are saying the same thing.
[00:48:32.497 --> 00:48:36.159]  Over 80% of the French public in major polls say our government did it.
[00:48:36.439 --> 00:48:38.260]  So, boy, we got foreigners to do it.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.661]  I think they come to the same conclusion we have.
[00:48:40.302 --> 00:48:40.782]  Right, right, right.
[00:48:40.802 --> 00:48:44.024]  But I'm just saying as far as people that don't have a stake, or don't have an interest, or don't
[00:48:44.864 --> 00:48:46.725]  You know, aren't controlling... Oh, I agree with you.
[00:48:46.825 --> 00:48:47.306]  I agree with you.
[00:48:47.326 --> 00:48:49.307]  I'm just saying that they would come to the same conclusion.
[00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:50.168]  Yeah.
[00:48:51.148 --> 00:48:55.031]  Well, I guess in the court of public opinion, I would say that people aren't buying the official story.
[00:48:56.312 --> 00:48:56.912]  No, they're not.
[00:48:57.333 --> 00:48:57.793]  They're not.
[00:48:57.873 --> 00:49:00.174]  And I would place myself in that court.
[00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:04.377]  But, you know, so we've talked about Building 7, right?
[00:49:05.838 --> 00:49:09.321]  And that whole episode really smells a rat.
[00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:13.924]  But then you've got to sort of shift the focus to the Pentagon.
[00:49:15.592 --> 00:49:16.453]  Very suspicious.
[00:49:16.893 --> 00:49:18.534]  You know, are we coming up on a break?
[00:49:18.554 --> 00:49:20.295]  Should we come back to the Pentagon after the break?
[00:49:20.355 --> 00:49:25.277]  Yeah, let's do that after the break, but in the minute and a half or so, we've got right now... Okay.
[00:49:25.297 --> 00:49:26.298]  What about PNAC?
[00:49:26.458 --> 00:49:38.244]  Project for an American Century, Dick Cheney pens a piece in September 2000 titled, Rebuilding America's Defenses, and he says, we need a Pearl Harbor event to catalyze the American people
[00:49:38.704 --> 00:49:40.445]  To invade the Middle East.
[00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:43.007]  We need to have a terror attack on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:45.029]  And then Brzezinski goes further.
[00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:47.330]  He says we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event.
[00:49:49.292 --> 00:49:50.132]  Yeah.
[00:49:50.753 --> 00:49:51.373]  Coincidence?
[00:49:51.834 --> 00:49:52.734]  We think not.
[00:49:54.836 --> 00:50:01.881]  No, I think again it's emblematic of the arrogance of this administration.
[00:50:03.482 --> 00:50:05.784]  Even just that video that was released
[00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:14.876]  Last week, I believe, the interview prior to Katrina, and I mean, it's not like there's, you know, again, supposition.
[00:50:15.057 --> 00:50:18.079]  It's documented quotes on videotape.
[00:50:19.059 --> 00:50:26.204]  And the White House comes out and says, well, you can't really look to that as any, you know, clear-cut example of what we knew.
[00:50:26.404 --> 00:50:28.565]  Yeah, FEMA said it's going to probably destroy the city.
[00:50:28.605 --> 00:50:30.106]  The Houston Chronicle reported that.
[00:50:30.487 --> 00:50:31.807]  Times-Picayune reported it.
[00:50:31.827 --> 00:50:32.488]  Everybody knew.
[00:50:32.508 --> 00:50:34.189]  And then Bush goes off on vacation.
[00:50:35.376 --> 00:50:35.596]  Yeah.
[00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:39.257]  No, again, it is a very arrogant administration.
[00:50:39.297 --> 00:50:40.997]  Well, what about them today?
[00:50:41.698 --> 00:50:45.338]  Mr. Sheen's saying that Iraq's better off and everything's going great.
[00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:47.739]  Yeah.
[00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:52.280]  I don't know that they're talking about the same Iraq that you and I are observing.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.140]  I agree with you.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:53.921]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:55.021]  Amazing interview.
[00:50:55.081 --> 00:50:56.761]  The conclusion on the other side.
[00:51:01.784 --> 00:51:08.631]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:10.313]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.493 --> 00:51:12.695]  The original film was 144 minutes long.

[00:51:15.218 --> 00:51:20.162]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.483 --> 00:51:24.527]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[00:51:26.609 --> 00:51:37.257]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.417 --> 00:51:39.299]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:52:21.064 --> 00:52:22.345]  to below detectable levels.
[00:52:22.625 --> 00:52:26.548]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:26.788 --> 00:52:33.314]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:33.534 --> 00:52:39.018]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[00:53:02.216 --> 00:53:02.697]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.538 --> 00:53:18.179]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:50.138]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.318 --> 00:53:56.260]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:09.963]  Well, I talked to him during the break, and he has really been a champ, spending a whole hour of his precious time with us.
[00:54:09.983 --> 00:54:15.525]  He's going to leave us in just about four minutes, five minutes, and go work on his TV show.
[00:54:16.491 --> 00:54:19.692]  Today, two-and-a-half men will be on tonight at eight o'clock CBS.
[00:54:20.712 --> 00:54:26.933]  But I was talking to him yesterday and he talked about some of the folks there where he works and a story that one of the crew told him.
[00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:29.154]  And it meshes with this article out of Knight Ridder.
[00:54:29.194 --> 00:54:35.135]  Today, Pentagon hired contractors to advise on collecting information on churches, mosques, and other U.S.
[00:54:35.175 --> 00:54:36.756]  sites spying on American citizens.
[00:54:36.796 --> 00:54:37.376]  Here's another one.
[00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:40.817]  Washington Post, advance workers for Bush impersonated reporters.
[00:54:41.157 --> 00:54:45.778]  They're all over the place posing as reporters spying on people and advance teams doing that.
[00:54:46.498 --> 00:54:48.900]  And they just do this all over the place.
[00:54:50.181 --> 00:54:51.561]  Charlie, your take on that?
[00:54:52.562 --> 00:55:12.615]  Yeah, there's a young guy, this young kid at work, he's from Nigeria, and he's in the production department, and he sort of overheard a conversation, I was talking about the events of 9-11 and this and that, and he said, you know, it was interesting because at the time, he was attending George Washington University in downtown D.C.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:30.117]  And he said the day after the event that federal teams of what they were described as trauma counselors came to his school, came to his college, came into the classrooms and basically told them, you're all in shock.
[00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:34.842]  What we've seen is unlike anything we've ever witnessed.
[00:55:35.322 --> 00:55:36.003]  We understand
[00:55:36.647 --> 00:55:43.173]  That in moments like this, that your memory, your eyes, will play tricks on you in the future.
[00:55:43.713 --> 00:55:45.315]  So, if anybody's questioning...
[00:55:47.075 --> 00:55:50.296]  You know, what we're telling you has happened.
[00:55:51.456 --> 00:55:55.097]  Do not believe what you think you know about yesterday.
[00:55:55.397 --> 00:56:01.158]  Basically telling them that here's the story, follow it, have a good day.
[00:56:01.178 --> 00:56:03.979]  I have questions about the Pentagon, so do you.
[00:56:04.039 --> 00:56:07.839]  Why did they grab hundreds of surveillance camera tapes and declare national security?
[00:56:07.859 --> 00:56:10.420]  Why won't they just show us the footage of what happened?
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.921]  Show us this incredible maneuvering.
[00:56:14.501 --> 00:56:15.482]  Just show it to us.
[00:56:16.182 --> 00:56:20.843]  Just show us, you know, how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers.
[00:56:20.984 --> 00:56:21.984]  What was it?
[00:56:22.084 --> 00:56:23.685]  A 270 degree turn at 500 miles an hour?
[00:56:24.065 --> 00:56:26.165]  Descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes?
[00:56:26.866 --> 00:56:31.467]  Skimming across the treetops the last 500 meters?
[00:56:31.727 --> 00:56:33.288]  You can't hold... Four feet off the ground?
[00:56:33.308 --> 00:56:41.131]  I have talked to pilots who've flown that very aircraft, that very type, and they say that at 500 and something miles an hour, you cannot fly that low to the ground.
[00:56:41.858 --> 00:56:51.720]  Yeah, no, if that happened and there are that many cameras on it, you know, I understand in the interest of national security that maybe not release the Pentagon cameras, but what about the Sheraton?
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.100]  What about the gas station?
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.900]  What about the Department of Transportation freeway cam?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.361]  What about all these shots that had this thing perfectly documented?
[00:57:00.241 --> 00:57:05.602]  Instead, they put out five frames that they claim not to have authorized, correct?
[00:57:06.682 --> 00:57:10.943]  And it doesn't look like a passenger liner, it looks like some type of small white aircraft or drone.
[00:57:11.747 --> 00:57:13.428]  It's really suspicious.
[00:57:13.608 --> 00:57:21.313]  And then, if you look in the lower left hand corner at the date stamp, it's September 12th.
[00:57:24.616 --> 00:57:27.618]  It's just... As usual, nothing they say fits.
[00:57:27.758 --> 00:57:29.079]  Nothing at any point.
[00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:31.160]  Everything they say turns out to be a fraud.
[00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:35.187]  Yeah, but just the whole thing about, well, the plane disintegrated and this and that.
[00:57:35.227 --> 00:57:43.593]  Now, I don't know what a Boeing, uh, you know, what that jet is going to do into a, you know, a reinforced limestone facade.
[00:57:43.673 --> 00:57:46.134]  But it did disappear like the Wicked Witch from Waterheader.
[00:57:46.214 --> 00:57:48.015]  It just, it just all went into a 14-foot hole.
[00:57:48.896 --> 00:57:49.456]  Exactly.
[00:57:49.757 --> 00:57:54.800]  Um, but this whole thing about, even if you just take the one statement about the wings folding up,
[00:57:55.419 --> 00:58:01.205]  It seems like at that impact velocity, everything is still going the same speed.
[00:58:01.385 --> 00:58:01.906]  You know what?
[00:58:02.826 --> 00:58:12.576]  Mr. Sheen, Charlie Sheen, we've got to get you back up in the near future, and of course you and I are going to be working on something in the near future, and I'm really honored to be collaborating with you, and I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:14.238]  Closing comments in the last 30 seconds.
[00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:17.121]  Last 30 seconds, it is up to us.
[00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:19.509]  To reveal the truth.
[00:58:19.569 --> 00:58:22.390]  It is up to us because we owe it to the families.
[00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:23.591]  We owe it to the victims.
[00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:32.616]  We owe it to everybody whose life was drastically altered, horrifically, that day and forever.
[00:58:32.776 --> 00:58:36.097]  We owe it to them to uncover what happened.
[00:58:36.198 --> 00:58:36.658]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:36.758 --> 00:58:37.218]  Godspeed.
[00:58:37.238 --> 00:58:38.059]  You've got a lot of courage.
[00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:38.779]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:48.413]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.823 --> 00:58:58.503]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.124 --> 00:59:00.205]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.906 --> 00:59:02.047]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.667 --> 00:59:03.508]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.249 --> 00:59:05.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.786 --> 00:59:09.430]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:14.074]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.255 --> 00:59:21.441]  Well, we just had one of the icons of Hollywood, Charlie Sheen, from an icon family, join us for the last hour.
[00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:22.662]  He wanted to stay.
[00:59:22.682 --> 00:59:23.183]  He had to go.
[00:59:23.223 --> 00:59:27.206]  He has to go shoot on the set for the next episode of Two and a Half Men.
[00:59:27.567 --> 00:59:29.569]  And it's raining, so he'll probably get there late anyways.
[00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:30.730]  He's getting there late to do this interview.
[00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:37.182]  So, uh, we're going to have him back on in the near future and we are working on some really neat stuff that I'm not going to talk about now.
[00:59:37.962 --> 00:59:43.886]  Uh, but, uh, just to finish up, he wanted to make the point when he ran out of time that the wings would have folded up.
[00:59:44.486 --> 00:59:45.567]  I mean, they claim they folded up.
[00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:50.670]  If they would have folded up, you would have seen the wreckage there or it would have left marks on the facade of the building.
[00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:51.690]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:54.292]  And that's what everybody else has said about the Pentagon.
[00:59:54.312 --> 00:59:56.854]  So we're very honored to have Mr. Sheen.
[00:59:56.894 --> 00:59:57.514]  I'm going to take a break.
[00:59:58.271 --> 01:00:00.212]  I need to come down off that interview a little bit.
[01:00:00.232 --> 01:00:06.434]  So I'm going to play Inside Job, where he talks about the towers, people that brought down the towers.
[01:00:06.574 --> 01:00:07.415]  It's an inside job.
[01:00:08.235 --> 01:00:11.236]  And from one of the big rock and rollers.
[01:00:11.336 --> 01:00:13.077]  See, everybody knows it's an inside job.
[01:00:13.637 --> 01:00:17.559]  So let's go ahead and roll that and we'll be right back with your calls and a lot of news on the other side.
[01:00:24.284 --> 01:00:27.646]  They came and took it all away.
[01:00:27.866 --> 01:00:32.429]  The lanes and the meadows.
[01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:37.032]  The places where you used to play.
[01:00:37.272 --> 01:00:39.233]  It was an inside job.
[01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:43.416]  By the well connected.
[01:00:43.576 --> 01:00:49.620]  You're a little frozen.
[01:00:52.854 --> 01:00:57.178]  I don't think so.
[01:01:24.423 --> 01:01:43.396]  This little island disappears While you are looking the other way They'll take your right to own your own ideas And if it isn't just
[01:01:45.165 --> 01:02:04.931]  You think that you're so smart But you don't have a single clue What those men up in the towers
[01:02:20.469 --> 01:02:20.789]  We're good to go.
[01:02:53.852 --> 01:02:55.974]  I know what I've done wrong.
[01:02:56.374 --> 01:02:59.056]  I am acquainted with the light.
[01:02:59.477 --> 01:03:05.121]  I know how hard it is to always walk out in the light.
[01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:11.646]  And it's an inside job to learn about forgiving.
[01:03:11.786 --> 01:03:13.588]  It's an inside job.
[01:03:15.472 --> 01:03:18.916]  We're good to go.
[01:03:54.755 --> 01:03:57.616]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.857 --> 01:03:59.437]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.778 --> 01:04:04.460]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:11.544]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.864 --> 01:04:13.826]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.046 --> 01:04:16.888]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.988 --> 01:04:21.631]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.832 --> 01:04:26.235]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:33.720]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:06:56.306 --> 01:06:59.088]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:08.655]  Well, you know what happened?
[01:07:09.376 --> 01:07:19.119]  Our AM and FM listeners that listen off of the satellites were able to hear the whole Charlie Sheen interview.
[01:07:19.699 --> 01:07:31.563]  But 15 minutes towards the end of the interview, about 45 after last hour, all of the streams, and I mean there are a bunch of streams, I've got servers, the network has servers, it just maxed out and crashed.
[01:07:31.623 --> 01:07:36.285]  So what I'm going to do is, that interview is so important as more and more prominent people go public,
[01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.888]  I'm just going to air that interview again next hour.
[01:07:40.088 --> 01:07:42.931]  We're getting a lot of requests and phones are ringing off the hook of the network.
[01:07:43.752 --> 01:07:51.761]  There are even some stations, believe it or not, that get these high quality digital internet feeds from us that are, I don't know, 100 and something bit or 56k.
[01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:53.223]  I forget what it is.
[01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.726]  We even have affiliates that take it off the web.
[01:07:55.746 --> 01:07:57.368]  They're known to dedicate streams and those even
[01:07:58.047 --> 01:08:01.110]  Went down because they were on the very servers that started smoking.
[01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:06.876]  So I apologize about you guys, I guess, losing roughly 10 minutes of broadcast and program.
[01:08:07.396 --> 01:08:10.039]  So we will re-air that coming up in the third hour.
[01:08:10.279 --> 01:08:10.959]  I think it's worth it.
[01:08:10.999 --> 01:08:12.461]  Isn't that what you want, listeners?
[01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:16.064]  If some of the listeners missed something, we should just go ahead and air it again.
[01:08:16.445 --> 01:08:18.967]  In this hour, we'll cover all the news and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:23.146 --> 01:08:25.368]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:08:25.428 --> 01:08:32.115]  For those that just tuned in, we had Charlie Sheen on last hour and Charlie contacted me about a week ago.
[01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:36.299]  And thank God I didn't miss his email.
[01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.741]  One of my staff picked it up.
[01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:45.328]  We get thousands and thousands a day and got in touch with him and confirmed it was Charlie Sheen and some other Hollywood contacts started talking to him.
[01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:46.409]  The guy is so informed.
[01:08:46.429 --> 01:08:46.910]  You talk to him
[01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:53.544]  Especially in private, he just knows so much about everything from vaccines to the war to you name it.
[01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:58.866]  And I'm really glad that I'm happy to know that he's another person that listens to the show.
[01:08:58.886 --> 01:09:02.407]  I mean, I don't tell you who listens to the show who's prominent.
[01:09:02.968 --> 01:09:05.869]  And I mean generals, congressmen and women.
[01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.510]  Really, it's daunting.
[01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:10.591]  It's amazing that we have this many listeners.
[01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:16.716]  Hollywood people, some of the biggest names, who listen routinely.
[01:09:16.916 --> 01:09:23.477]  I mean, that listen every week that I'm in contact with, that I talk to, but that are afraid to go public.
[01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:25.798]  Well, not Charlie Sheen.
[01:09:26.698 --> 01:09:30.919]  He is putting a lot on the line to come out and do that.
[01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:36.660]  I mean, he's already been on the tabloids before for his taste in women and other things.
[01:09:37.458 --> 01:09:42.764]  Hell, everybody knows the President's a lot wilder than Charlie Sheen, so I don't want to get any neocon emails talking bad about him.
[01:09:44.185 --> 01:09:47.789]  Boy, look at the beam in George Bush's eye, your emperor, your god.
[01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:54.376]  But he's a great guy, and again, of all the Hollywood people I've talked to, he is the most informed.
[01:09:54.516 --> 01:09:57.559]  And I mean, I've talked to some that just live this stuff constantly.
[01:09:58.288 --> 01:09:59.869]  And he confirmed what I already knew.
[01:09:59.889 --> 01:10:13.078]  In Hollywood right now, that's why you are actually seeing movies come out that are anti-New World Order, the establishment is having a lot of trouble trying to keep all their producers and people in line because they all want to talk about this.
[01:10:13.138 --> 01:10:13.719]  I mean, why not?
[01:10:13.779 --> 01:10:14.980]  The truth is dynamic.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.700]  It's amazing.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.521]  It's invigorating.
[01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:17.181]  It's scary.
[01:10:17.782 --> 01:10:19.103]  And it's what people want to talk about.
[01:10:19.143 --> 01:10:20.143]  It's what they want to get into.
[01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:22.365]  So we had Charlie Sheen on with a stick in his toe.
[01:10:23.288 --> 01:10:33.275]  In the water today, here on the Alex Jones Show, where we cover real talk radio, real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[01:10:35.657 --> 01:10:41.181]  And I am just, again, blown away by the fact that top Japanese CEOs
[01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:49.722]  Listen to the radio show and watch my films that the UN Security Council's ordered them.
[01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:53.803]  That we've sent orders to the National Security Council in this government.
[01:10:54.423 --> 01:10:56.324]  That the Pentagon orders my videos.
[01:10:56.364 --> 01:11:02.145]  I mean, I'm not just talking about visitors to the website because you can go, oh look, 5% of our traffic's government.
[01:11:02.205 --> 01:11:06.587]  Oh look, NSA, DEA, Defense Intelligence.
[01:11:07.127 --> 01:11:11.988]  I mean, any big site's going to have that because there's employees there late at night and a lot of that's just traffic.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.061]  It's patriots or people following a link.
[01:11:17.021 --> 01:11:19.202]  You know, a lot of folks go, look, I've got traffic on my website.
[01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:20.802]  That means the government's looking at me.
[01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:22.062]  Most of the time that is not the case.
[01:11:23.023 --> 01:11:28.824]  No, no, but when the heads of federal agencies are ordering the videos.
[01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:37.326]  When big international banking associations in Switzerland and then, oh, the other day, again, I won't say names, I don't.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:44.002]  It's kind of like the guy in school who goes out and dates the girls and keeps his mouth shut and the girls start really, his name starts getting around.
[01:11:44.122 --> 01:11:44.582]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:49.523]  No, I mean, seriously, and that's a terrible analogy, but I keep my mouth shut.
[01:11:49.863 --> 01:12:04.487]  But to sit there and to see orders that come in from, you know, international banking associations based in Europe, places like Austria, to have, I mean, to be contacted, to know that top
[01:12:05.577 --> 01:12:05.978]  Several.
[01:12:06.478 --> 01:12:10.361]  But in one case, one top CEO of a Japanese company.
[01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:15.725]  And they have staff checking out what I'm saying and cross-referencing and listening.
[01:12:16.025 --> 01:12:17.787]  Because they know it's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:19.788]  And don't ask me why they all tune into this show.
[01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:23.391]  I mean, I'm bombastic.
[01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:24.592]  I've got my problems.
[01:12:24.852 --> 01:12:28.355]  And I frankly sometimes don't even like to listen to my own shows.
[01:12:28.375 --> 01:12:29.596]  Sometimes I listen and I go, that's great radio.
[01:12:29.616 --> 01:12:32.058]  Other times I listen and I go, I sound like a babbling monkey.
[01:12:32.518 --> 01:12:33.879]  A jibbering ape.
[01:12:34.837 --> 01:12:37.160]  Uh... but I think I telegraphed the truth to people.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.484]  People know, I mean, I'm in this for survival.
[01:12:41.005 --> 01:12:51.438]  I'm in this for the right reasons and people have instincts and people's instincts are getting honed because things are getting so dangerous in the world that it has a way of getting people's heads screwed on straight and folks
[01:12:52.566 --> 01:12:56.287]  See the COINTELPRO operatives, the DISINFO operatives from a mile away.
[01:12:56.307 --> 01:12:58.347]  And that's why you are losers.
[01:12:58.567 --> 01:13:01.308]  Some of you out there that attack the show and do the things you do.
[01:13:01.348 --> 01:13:03.229]  And why no one will ever have truck with you.
[01:13:03.549 --> 01:13:04.869]  No one will ever suck with you.
[01:13:04.889 --> 01:13:06.669]  Or give you sucker.
[01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:08.970]  No one wants to be around you.
[01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:14.311]  Because you're evil, grasping, dark side individuals.
[01:13:15.231 --> 01:13:16.552]  And you're going to lose.
[01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:17.252]  Believe me.
[01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:23.451]  I snuck out last night after work and saw a V for Vendetta.
[01:13:23.491 --> 01:13:24.592]  My wife hears it and she's going to get mad.
[01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:25.533]  She wanted me to take her to it.
[01:13:27.935 --> 01:13:30.136]  But I'm going to be caught by my own mouth.
[01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:32.498]  But I snuck off and watched it last night.
[01:13:33.579 --> 01:13:34.459]  And it was good.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.361]  People said it was Illuminati.
[01:13:36.421 --> 01:13:39.743]  And I'd read some of the different synopses that were out there about it.
[01:13:40.343 --> 01:13:42.365]  Those were dishonest.
[01:13:42.765 --> 01:13:44.286]  I have questions about the Matrix.
[01:13:44.847 --> 01:13:47.188]  I have questions about some of the Illuminati things that are in it.
[01:13:47.569 --> 01:13:48.409]  Especially in the third one.
[01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:51.592]  What is it?
[01:13:52.072 --> 01:13:54.093]  Matrix Revolutions or Revelations?
[01:13:54.133 --> 01:13:54.533]  I forget.
[01:13:56.793 --> 01:14:01.114]  But the Wachowski brothers with V for Vendetta, I know why the media is attacking them.
[01:14:01.134 --> 01:14:15.178]  I mean, it shows the government carrying out terror attacks with a bird flu type weapon to get martial law, to go after their political enemies, and to sell the pharmaceutical that is the cure for it.
[01:14:17.378 --> 01:14:19.439]  Which is what's happening in our real world.
[01:14:20.812 --> 01:14:26.236]  And in the film, of course, the government... Well, just go see it for yourself.
[01:14:26.256 --> 01:14:27.217]  There's a lot of other things in it.
[01:14:29.119 --> 01:14:33.622]  It should also scare you, though, because a lot of times we see in Hollywood what the New World Order is actually going to do later.
[01:14:34.723 --> 01:14:38.106]  In some cases, the bad guys do that themselves, but in others, it's the opposite.
[01:14:39.067 --> 01:14:40.428]  But everybody knows they're in danger.
[01:14:40.568 --> 01:14:42.349]  Servants of the New World Order know they're in danger.
[01:14:42.389 --> 01:14:44.491]  People who are big-time know they're in danger.
[01:14:44.511 --> 01:14:49.515]  And that's why they're finally jumping ship, finally getting off the fence in some cases,
[01:14:50.242 --> 01:14:57.283]  Now, those who are just neutral and joining the fight for humanity, joining the fight for liberty, joining the fight against dehumanization.
[01:14:59.624 --> 01:15:06.865]  Because they know that this is bad for everybody, that the elite are psychopathic.
[01:15:06.905 --> 01:15:08.326]  I mean, why are the elite?
[01:15:08.686 --> 01:15:14.327]  There's an article here where different states are trying to pass laws banning cities and counties
[01:15:15.226 --> 01:15:22.371]  and different farming associations from themselves banning the cross-species genetically engineered crops.
[01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:28.156]  You see, the limballs of the world try to confuse this issue.
[01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:32.359]  They try to confuse the issue
[01:15:33.766 --> 01:15:38.149]  And they try to say, oh, George Washington Carver, he engaged in genetic engineering.
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:49.398]  Yeah, he'd take one variety of peanut and cross it with five other peanuts and find out which one used less water, less soil, and a larger fruit inside the peanut shell.
[01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:52.780]  Now, that's just simple breeding, just like we've bred dogs.
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.204]  You're still working with the original canine genetics.
[01:15:57.264 --> 01:15:58.685]  That's what canine familiaris is.
[01:15:59.364 --> 01:16:09.319]  You take the, I guess, three different subspecies of wolf and the different variants there is where you then get the different derivations of canine familiaris.
[01:16:09.995 --> 01:16:11.276]  That is not cross-species.
[01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:32.115]  When you stick spider genes in goats, or tomato genes in pigs, or human genes in pigs, or jellyfish and cockroach and salamander genes in corn, and that's the kind of stuff that's in them, or you stick part of two different bacteria and three other plants from totally different species, not even the same genus or group, into it,
[01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:44.840]  Then you get really dangerous stuff that can give rise to super-funguses, super-bacteria, super-viruses that can take over other whole plant species or animal species.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:57.465]  And they're now admitting that most of the allergies, the explosion in allergies, people never had allergies that we're seeing, are because of all this genetically engineered pollen out there in the air that's got other plant and animal matter in it and the body really sees it as a bacteria.
[01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:05.834]  And then they're using DU all over the planet, which their own handbooks admit will kill you, guaranteed.
[01:17:06.715 --> 01:17:08.696]  You're going to live a life of misery and then you're going to die.
[01:17:09.657 --> 01:17:13.559]  If you get just even small amounts of this and now it's in the air globally.
[01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:20.824]  And then they race to buy up the government and private testing centers to make sure no one can even release that data.
[01:17:21.889 --> 01:17:22.690]  Why are they doing that?
[01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:23.031]  Why?
[01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.213]  The elite could have taken Iraq.
[01:17:24.233 --> 01:17:26.235]  They could take over without using DU.
[01:17:26.295 --> 01:17:27.357]  They themselves breathe.
[01:17:27.437 --> 01:17:27.717]  Why?
[01:17:27.778 --> 01:17:28.999]  What's wrong with them?
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.341]  They're evil.
[01:17:31.343 --> 01:17:32.284]  They're malfunctioning.
[01:17:32.364 --> 01:17:33.486]  They love death.
[01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:36.250]  They are possessed with destructive tendencies.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.763]  And these crooks, these big crime families, none of them will say no to each other.
[01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:48.506]  So they're all just racing each other to get new developments and new patents and new profits in the corner and control industry.
[01:17:48.546 --> 01:17:51.468]  So there's no legitimate sane controls.
[01:17:52.088 --> 01:17:59.492]  And they're busy pulling you and your family over saying they want to search your car because 9-11 and America's in a new atmosphere because we're all in danger.
[01:18:00.213 --> 01:18:04.035]  You better not worry about planes blowing up or even A-bombs going off.
[01:18:04.335 --> 01:18:07.337]  That is nothing compared to the genetic engineering and the DU
[01:18:08.672 --> 01:18:08.972]  What is it?
[01:18:09.012 --> 01:18:13.074]  The equivalent of 44,000 Hiroshima A-bombs?
[01:18:13.174 --> 01:18:16.975]  That's the equivalent of uranium that has been released in the atmosphere by the DU?
[01:18:17.315 --> 01:18:18.636]  I mean, 40-something thousand?
[01:18:18.696 --> 01:18:19.516]  That's official numbers!
[01:18:19.576 --> 01:18:27.920]  It makes all the A-bomb and hydrogen bomb, the Keeney Island stuff, all the New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada stuff look like... child's play!
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:36.163]  All the Russian testing, the Chinese testing, the French testing, the British testing... It's nothing!
[01:18:38.027 --> 01:18:41.111]  The equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs.
[01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:45.595]  A-bombs.
[01:18:46.376 --> 01:18:47.237]  And we're breathing it.
[01:18:48.639 --> 01:18:51.902]  The radiation detectors are ringing off the hook.
[01:18:53.584 --> 01:18:58.886]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:18:59.086 --> 01:19:01.167]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:08.531]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:19:08.651 --> 01:19:20.176]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:27.942]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:33.206]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:19:33.346 --> 01:19:38.370]  Disconnect your application and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:44.034]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:19:54.003 --> 01:19:57.668]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:58.088 --> 01:20:03.515]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:03.975 --> 01:20:05.057]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:05.097 --> 01:20:09.122]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:09.762 --> 01:20:23.089]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:28.893]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:29.193 --> 01:20:35.076]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:20:49.318 --> 01:20:57.362]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:57.942 --> 01:20:59.683]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:00.851 --> 01:21:08.743]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:08.963 --> 01:21:11.607]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:21:11.587 --> 01:21:13.009]  's patented methodology.

[01:21:53.263 --> 01:21:55.523]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.724 --> 01:22:06.186]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:11.467]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:16.668]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[01:22:17.373 --> 01:22:23.040]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[01:22:23.817 --> 01:22:31.821]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:55.777 --> 01:23:01.842]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:05.446]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:12.452]  Sure enough, you've been requesting it on instant messenger and emails and phone calls.
[01:23:12.472 --> 01:23:19.558]  You want to hear the interview again because some of the internet listeners, well, all the internet listeners got knocked off because it maxed out the servers and we can
[01:23:20.618 --> 01:23:23.539]  We could have tens of thousands listen, so it's pretty serious.
[01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:25.600]  Just on the net, which is a small part of our audience.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:35.323]  I know we've got Johnny and many others that are holding, but John Connor of the Resistance Manifesto has done a lot of great work out there exposing the New World Order.
[01:23:35.623 --> 01:23:36.384]  He just called in.
[01:23:36.404 --> 01:23:38.224]  Well, he called in on the studio line.
[01:23:38.244 --> 01:23:39.085]  I'm not supposed to do that.
[01:23:41.077 --> 01:23:42.338]  I'll put him in the time-out for that.
[01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:44.219]  But, John, good to hear from you.
[01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:44.859]  What's on your mind?
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.201]  Alex, I just want to touch on a few points.
[01:23:47.221 --> 01:23:51.623]  Since you mentioned Veefer and Dave Vendetta, I'm going to be posting a review here in about five minutes.
[01:23:52.063 --> 01:23:56.026]  Well, let me ask you a question of what you thought of the Sheen interview.
[01:23:56.046 --> 01:23:58.047]  Oh, absolutely fantastic.
[01:23:58.107 --> 01:24:01.569]  I'm sending out emails letting everybody know so they can tune in to the rebroadcast.
[01:24:02.034 --> 01:24:03.075]  I think it's fantastic.
[01:24:03.115 --> 01:24:09.440]  I hope that Charlie Sheen just stands up and charges straight forward with all of his contacts to get this information out, Alex.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.961]  Congratulations on that interview.
[01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:15.324]  Well, I'm not going to say what he's planning to do, but it's exciting.
[01:24:16.345 --> 01:24:19.287]  Well, listen, I just have a few points I want to touch on V for Vendetta.
[01:24:19.307 --> 01:24:21.929]  Sorry for calling on the studio line, but I feel it's fairly important.
[01:24:21.949 --> 01:24:22.609]  I was teasing you.
[01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:23.190]  What's on your mind?
[01:24:23.675 --> 01:24:33.166]  Well, I just want to say, for those who haven't seen it, be careful for the pro-homosexual and anti-Christian messages which are blatantly slipped into the storyline.
[01:24:33.186 --> 01:24:33.887]  Oh, you're right.
[01:24:33.907 --> 01:24:34.228]  You're right.
[01:24:34.248 --> 01:24:35.409]  In fact, I sent in a writer review.
[01:24:35.449 --> 01:24:36.571]  There is some of that in there.
[01:24:36.591 --> 01:24:39.274]  I meant where they're claiming it's pro-terrorist.
[01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.698]  I meant the message of showing the government's behind the terror.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.021]  Well, yeah.
[01:24:44.181 --> 01:24:47.343]  But it is a right-wing government, and that's because the liberals can't figure it out.
[01:24:47.363 --> 01:24:54.689]  The liberals look at Bush and believe that he's really a Christian, and so they think that's what tyranny is, and I've talked about how that's done on purpose.
[01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:56.810]  There are a few points.
[01:24:57.651 --> 01:25:03.275]  The character V was the victim of an MKUltra-type experiment, which, in a sense, created him.
[01:25:03.656 --> 01:25:10.401]  The government did cause the death of hundreds of thousands of people to cause a police state in a pretext for their fascist regime.
[01:25:10.681 --> 01:25:11.962]  And to sell the pharmaceutical.
[01:25:12.754 --> 01:25:24.618]  Yes, and I think it's very dangerous that this government, although they're not using the label Christian, it's very clear that it is a Christian fascist government with the pro-homosexual messages.
[01:25:24.658 --> 01:25:26.639]  But it shows that they're not really Christians.
[01:25:28.059 --> 01:25:28.439]  Correct.
[01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:33.761]  They are a perverted sect of the Christianity, which is what most of the Christians believe.
[01:25:33.781 --> 01:25:36.762]  Well, it shows them all partying and sex and drugs.
[01:25:36.782 --> 01:25:42.104]  It clearly shows the Catholic bishop, I mean, clearly not a Christian.
[01:25:42.978 --> 01:25:43.178]  Sure.
[01:25:43.258 --> 01:25:58.432]  I just wonder, even though this is a great tool for addressing issues for our constitutional freedoms and issues of privacy, I do question the motives of the film's producers as to glorifying guy folks and seeming to plant the idea
[01:25:58.892 --> 01:26:13.362]  That what he was going to do was a good thing back in 1605 on November 5th when he and his crew... Well, I wasn't really an expert on that, and now I've researched some of the gunpowder plot, and a lot of evidence shows that it was another staged deal where the British just grabbed their enemies, claiming they were going to blow something up, and it wasn't true.
[01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:16.745]  Well, Alex, you'll be the one to uncover that and get to the truth.
[01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:25.591]  Well, no, that's... I mean, that's in a lot of mainstream histories, that it was just a big setup and that they had provocateurs in there trying to stir people up to do it.
[01:26:26.798 --> 01:26:27.899]  Hey, that's a fantastic thing.
[01:26:27.919 --> 01:26:29.340]  Somebody should post an article on that.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.783]  But I just wanted to express my disgust for the pro-homosexual and the anti-Christian message.
[01:26:35.164 --> 01:26:39.426]  And I really just think that we need to take this film... Well, you know, the cross they use is the double cross.
[01:26:39.466 --> 01:26:42.348]  It's actually the Knights Templar Illuminati cross.
[01:26:42.388 --> 01:26:43.429]  It's a double red cross.
[01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:53.738]  Yeah, but they do, in the film, ban the Koran, and the television preacher does have a book which remains unnamed, but obviously it's a Christian Bible.
[01:26:53.858 --> 01:26:57.682]  So, there is some Christian bashing in the sub-bible.
[01:26:57.702 --> 01:26:58.162]  I agree with you.
[01:26:58.683 --> 01:26:59.063]  You know what?
[01:26:59.083 --> 01:26:59.483]  You're right.
[01:27:00.785 --> 01:27:02.847]  I was delirious and tired last night when I watched it again.
[01:27:03.797 --> 01:27:11.960]  Yeah, well, I just wanted to touch on those points, and I just fear that they're going to hope that this sparks some MK-Ultra-type Timothy McVadick.
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.260]  Well, look, I've said this.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.820]  Listen, I've said this already.
[01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:23.103]  Clearly, they're planning to have Bush demonize conservatives and then bring in a, quote, liberal-cow revolution that'll just continue with the Patriot Act and all the rest of it.
[01:27:23.183 --> 01:27:24.644]  Surely, that's being set up.
[01:27:25.644 --> 01:27:28.525]  Yep, so I just want to throw these red flags to the Foomis.
[01:27:28.605 --> 01:27:30.565]  Fantastic tool for awakening people.
[01:27:30.665 --> 01:27:31.446]  Alex, gotta run.
[01:27:31.506 --> 01:27:32.266]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:33.346 --> 01:27:33.726]  You bet!
[01:27:33.907 --> 01:27:35.408]  Thank you for the call.
[01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:37.910]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Texas.
[01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:38.851]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:39.411]  We'll hold you over.
[01:27:39.431 --> 01:27:39.832]  Go ahead.
[01:27:40.192 --> 01:27:40.933]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:27:41.073 --> 01:27:41.793]  Good afternoon.
[01:27:43.575 --> 01:27:44.556]  I've enjoyed your show.
[01:27:44.576 --> 01:27:45.737]  It's a little bit off topic.
[01:27:45.937 --> 01:27:49.780]  I've enjoyed your show on Austin Access for well over a year now.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:55.305]  I turned on the other day to watch it and it wasn't there.
[01:27:55.485 --> 01:27:59.448]  It had been replaced by the City of Lakeway Bulletin Board.
[01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:01.490]  So this entire area
[01:28:02.051 --> 01:28:10.058]  In Apache Shores, which is just outside of Lakeway, this entire area used to get your show.
[01:28:10.438 --> 01:28:14.822]  You and Jeff Davis and everybody else, the Free Speech Channel was there.
[01:28:14.842 --> 01:28:15.703]  It was available.
[01:28:16.063 --> 01:28:16.964]  Now it's not.
[01:28:17.064 --> 01:28:18.185]  It's been taken away.
[01:28:18.225 --> 01:28:19.386]  Do you know anything about this?
[01:28:20.367 --> 01:28:20.728]  Yeah.
[01:28:21.773 --> 01:28:29.699]  A lot of cities carried the AXS outside Austin, so we were able to reach over potentially millions, and all around us, they're shutting off the show.
[01:28:30.259 --> 01:28:30.740]  So stay there.
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.880]  Tell me more about it when we get back.
[01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:33.942]  Yeah, I mean, we sort it out on AXS TV.
[01:28:34.022 --> 01:28:34.783]  I still do it every week.
[01:28:34.823 --> 01:28:35.583]  It's very effective.
[01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:38.145]  They're shutting it down all over the country.
[01:28:38.165 --> 01:28:38.625]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.789 --> 01:28:44.690]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:46.791]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.692 --> 01:28:50.394]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.150 --> 01:29:01.012]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.172 --> 01:29:14.096]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.276 --> 01:29:16.057]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.257 --> 01:29:19.719]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:23.762]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:24.022 --> 01:29:29.006]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:29.266 --> 01:29:30.987]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:31.247 --> 01:29:35.190]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.312]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:42.036]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.

[01:29:54.204 --> 01:30:00.427]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.587 --> 01:30:06.750]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:15.474]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.715 --> 01:30:22.718]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:23.038 --> 01:30:27.861]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:33.485]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.825 --> 01:30:36.907]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:37.228 --> 01:30:45.193]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.233 --> 01:30:45.813]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.259 --> 01:30:57.580]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.182]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:31:02.702 --> 01:31:10.085]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:31:10.509 --> 01:31:14.510]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:28.815]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:31:28.835 --> 01:31:32.116]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of Stem Enhancer.
[01:31:32.518 --> 01:31:36.780]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:40.061]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:31:40.201 --> 01:31:40.721]  Call me.
[01:31:40.881 --> 01:31:42.722]  Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[01:31:42.762 --> 01:31:44.002]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:31:44.022 --> 01:31:45.963]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:45.983 --> 01:31:48.063]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:05.133]  Waging war on corruption!
[01:32:07.394 --> 01:32:08.415]  I want to run through the news.
[01:32:08.475 --> 01:32:09.616]  It's all very important.
[01:32:11.738 --> 01:32:15.181]  So, let's move to your calls quickly so I can get back into the news.
[01:32:16.124 --> 01:32:30.268]  Johnny, I am aware of what you're discussing, and in the past, a few years ago, Time Warner cabled the AXS channels with the city and the county and the school TV channels showing all the meetings, and then three channels of citizens.
[01:32:30.768 --> 01:32:37.070]  Very popular, people would ask for it, but no, now other areas will just run bulletin board, which no one wants to see.
[01:32:37.170 --> 01:32:38.090]  Why would they do that?
[01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:40.091]  These are Time Warner systems.
[01:32:40.371 --> 01:32:44.512]  Time Warner is suing the city right now to shut down AXS TV in Austin.
[01:32:44.532 --> 01:32:45.192]  I mean, I've had to
[01:32:45.982 --> 01:32:46.803]  We're good to go.
[01:33:10.616 --> 01:33:14.679]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying about out there by Lake Travis getting shut off.
[01:33:15.039 --> 01:33:23.125]  Okay, now I've been in this area for about eight years and I maintain a place for my mother out there in Lakeway.
[01:33:23.705 --> 01:33:27.908]  Okay, my wife and I bought a place just outside of Lakeway in Apache Shores.
[01:33:28.309 --> 01:33:37.175]  Now for all these previous eight years in the city of Lakeway proper you were not able to get Austin Access free speech channel.
[01:33:37.697 --> 01:33:45.326]  If you went out of the city limits and knew somebody over in Apache Shores, you could get it because this is an unincorporated area and still considered part of the city of Austin.
[01:33:45.846 --> 01:33:47.048]  So that's the way it was.
[01:33:47.108 --> 01:33:51.573]  You could come to Apache Shores and watch your show or Jeff Davis or anybody, which I did quite often.
[01:33:52.133 --> 01:33:53.475]  Now you can't do that.
[01:33:54.051 --> 01:34:01.055]  Now it's, you come out of Lakeway, you come to Apache Shores, you turn it on and it's just a... Well, you call them and ask why that's happening?
[01:34:01.456 --> 01:34:02.456]  No, I don't know who to call.
[01:34:02.676 --> 01:34:03.337]  Who should I call?
[01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:03.817]  Time Warner?
[01:34:04.137 --> 01:34:06.499]  Yes, and then find out the specific little provider.
[01:34:06.519 --> 01:34:08.080]  They may be feeding another provider out there.
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:08.660]  Anything else, sir?
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.602]  No, it's just that, this is the mentality.
[01:34:11.642 --> 01:34:16.985]  Lakeway is full of what, it's full of what I like to refer to as Bush Nazis, and this is their mentality.
[01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:19.703]  Let's not let our kids see free speech.
[01:34:19.783 --> 01:34:22.305]  I mean, they isolate these kids in Lakeway.
[01:34:22.445 --> 01:34:23.586]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:34:23.746 --> 01:34:24.046]  Oh, really?
[01:34:24.086 --> 01:34:24.987]  I've talked to the police.
[01:34:25.007 --> 01:34:30.111]  They're some of the... I'm not saying all the rich people out there are bad, but it's some of the most corrupt, decadent kids, period.
[01:34:30.571 --> 01:34:31.371]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:34:31.472 --> 01:34:32.833]  And they've got a great police force.
[01:34:33.113 --> 01:34:36.776]  I actually know some of the people in the force.
[01:34:36.816 --> 01:34:38.437]  Yeah, actually, I do too, as well.
[01:34:38.497 --> 01:34:39.678]  I go fishing out there and stuff.
[01:34:40.118 --> 01:34:40.298]  Right.
[01:34:40.318 --> 01:34:41.319]  They're a great bunch of guys.
[01:34:42.039 --> 01:34:43.881]  They've had their hands tied for a long time.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.164]  And now they're finally getting some... My point is, they're not really protecting those children from anything.
[01:34:50.345 --> 01:34:52.066]  All right, well listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:34:52.607 --> 01:34:55.769]  That's bad to hear, but I mean, they're shutting them down all over the country.
[01:34:55.829 --> 01:34:58.631]  Every week I see some major access station just shut down.
[01:34:59.252 --> 01:35:00.853]  It won't be there soon, so use it.
[01:35:00.973 --> 01:35:04.076]  That's why I say get my films and make copies of them.
[01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:05.497]  And I guess I don't say that enough, because
[01:35:06.235 --> 01:35:09.356]  Charlie Sheen listens to the show, and he says, hey, have I ever made copies of these?
[01:35:09.376 --> 01:35:10.816]  And I'm like, man, make all the copies you want.
[01:35:10.836 --> 01:35:11.376]  He's like, great.
[01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:14.816]  So in case any of you other people haven't heard, make copies.
[01:35:14.836 --> 01:35:16.297]  That's my whole point of making these.
[01:35:17.477 --> 01:35:19.917]  Let's talk to Dean in Tennessee.
[01:35:19.937 --> 01:35:20.677]  Dean, you're on the air.
[01:35:21.898 --> 01:35:22.678]  How you do, Alex?
[01:35:23.058 --> 01:35:28.159]  On the original broadcast on television, they talked about bombs going off at the Twin Towers.
[01:35:28.279 --> 01:35:28.759]  You remember?
[01:35:28.879 --> 01:35:29.999]  Have you seen any of those tapes?
[01:35:30.259 --> 01:35:32.199]  Yeah, I've got clips of it in some of my films.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.660]  OK, I wasn't sure.
[01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:39.032]  I have a tape of the original one that I've just looked at.
[01:35:40.153 --> 01:35:41.434]  Do me a favor in case I don't have it.
[01:35:41.474 --> 01:35:42.395]  Make yourself a copy.
[01:35:42.555 --> 01:35:44.336]  Make me an SP copy and mail it to me.
[01:35:44.356 --> 01:35:44.657]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:44.677 --> 01:35:46.318]  Okay, that's why I was calling you.
[01:35:46.378 --> 01:35:47.619]  Because it's never been run.
[01:35:47.699 --> 01:35:49.180]  The first time I've run it was today.
[01:35:49.921 --> 01:35:50.841]  Well, do me a favor.
[01:35:50.862 --> 01:35:52.203]  There's a lot of tapes that I don't have.
[01:35:52.223 --> 01:35:54.084]  So send it to me.
[01:35:54.684 --> 01:35:56.226]  Okay, there's four hours of it.
[01:35:56.826 --> 01:35:57.166]  Please.
[01:35:57.847 --> 01:35:58.928]  Okay, it's on its way.
[01:35:58.968 --> 01:35:59.508]  Thank you, Al.
[01:35:59.928 --> 01:36:00.409]  Anything else?
[01:36:01.184 --> 01:36:04.266]  Uh, no sir, just keep it up and I'm just a lone wolf here in Tennessee.
[01:36:04.546 --> 01:36:05.966]  What'd you think of the interview last hour?
[01:36:06.787 --> 01:36:07.667]  Uh, I didn't get to hear it.
[01:36:07.707 --> 01:36:08.508]  We got knocked off.
[01:36:09.548 --> 01:36:10.829]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:11.749]  That's why we're gonna re-air it.
[01:36:12.489 --> 01:36:13.570]  Hope it doesn't happen again.
[01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:15.351]  Uh, let's talk to Rita and Matt.
[01:36:15.451 --> 01:36:16.231]  Rita, you're on the air.
[01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:16.671]  Go ahead.
[01:36:21.714 --> 01:36:22.734]  Okay, Rita's not there.
[01:36:22.754 --> 01:36:24.135]  Uh, Robert in Denver.
[01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.015]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:36:25.055 --> 01:36:25.415]  Go ahead.
[01:36:26.436 --> 01:36:27.596]  Good morning, Alexander.
[01:36:27.637 --> 01:36:28.117]  How are you?
[01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:28.437]  Good.
[01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:29.370]  Good.
[01:36:29.511 --> 01:36:33.416]  Do you still have the same ruling that old timers like me can only call in once a week?
[01:36:33.556 --> 01:36:34.617]  Is that still the same edict?
[01:36:35.819 --> 01:36:35.999]  Sure.
[01:36:36.079 --> 01:36:42.869]  All I said was is that people who call every day, I'd like them to try to limit it to once a week.
[01:36:43.289 --> 01:36:45.372]  Only because a lot of people complain they can never get through.
[01:36:45.945 --> 01:36:46.245]  I hear you.
[01:36:46.285 --> 01:36:46.665]  Fair enough.
[01:36:47.046 --> 01:36:48.586]  Hey, three quick questions.
[01:36:48.726 --> 01:36:54.069]  A year ago, we talked about Howard and going to Sirius and the big money.
[01:36:54.089 --> 01:37:01.192]  He didn't think it would happen, but as you know, he went on the air in January this year and he seems to be blowing and going, although I can't... I want to know what you thought of that.
[01:37:01.212 --> 01:37:03.813]  Do you still think he's going to be on the air for the next three or four years?
[01:37:03.833 --> 01:37:05.053]  How do you see that playing out?
[01:37:05.614 --> 01:37:07.354]  Are you saying I said I didn't think it would work?
[01:37:07.514 --> 01:37:08.835]  I think I said I thought it would work.
[01:37:09.655 --> 01:37:10.056]  Oh, okay.
[01:37:10.076 --> 01:37:11.156]  I thought you said it wouldn't.
[01:37:11.436 --> 01:37:13.677]  Well, I jabbered so fast, maybe you misunderstood me.
[01:37:13.757 --> 01:37:15.398]  I mean, no, he's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:17.763]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:24.648]  Two weeks ago, 12 pages of Denver Post, there was a survey done that showed Bush is approved rating within the low 30s.
[01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:30.253]  The same survey said that 72% of the soldiers in Iraq said they should get out in a year.
[01:37:30.574 --> 01:37:31.795]  Did you see that survey?
[01:37:31.815 --> 01:37:37.860]  Well, that was the Zogby, the other was Lapue Research Center, and they both show similar numbers.
[01:37:39.202 --> 01:37:43.243]  Some polls show him as low as 25 percent, a lot of them 27, some 33.
[01:37:43.283 --> 01:37:45.644]  The big CBS and U.S.
[01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:47.304]  CNN polls are showing 32, 34.
[01:37:50.165 --> 01:37:53.986]  Meanwhile, Cheney and Bush are saying that the war is going great and everything is wonderful.
[01:37:55.186 --> 01:37:59.067]  But do you think that the part about the soldiers, 70 percent, saying we should get out is accurate?
[01:37:59.087 --> 01:37:59.767]  Do you agree with that?
[01:38:00.267 --> 01:38:03.068]  Oh, I think it's higher than that from the soldiers I've talked to.
[01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:03.968]  Really?
[01:38:04.008 --> 01:38:04.928]  They echo the same thing?
[01:38:05.555 --> 01:38:10.743]  Yeah, I mean, you've got some brainwashed soldiers that just think it's all wonderful, but most of them are pretty smart.
[01:38:10.783 --> 01:38:16.011]  I mean, you normally find that 70 plus percent of soldiers are on the right side of things, are good people.
[01:38:16.332 --> 01:38:20.699]  Most of them do join because they love this country and think they're fighting for this country, in most cases.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.182]  76% in the famous 29 Palm survey.
[01:38:24.222 --> 01:38:26.464]  Will you fire on Americans under PDD 25?
[01:38:27.686 --> 01:38:29.607]  76% said no.
[01:38:29.648 --> 01:38:33.371]  And then they've had other official surveys and it's in the high 70s.
[01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:37.695]  So those numbers mesh with 70 plus percent are good people.
[01:38:38.376 --> 01:38:38.816]  Well good.
[01:38:38.856 --> 01:38:40.118]  The others are dumb as dirt.
[01:38:41.099 --> 01:38:43.461]  And you know that's better numbers than you find in the general public.
[01:38:44.962 --> 01:38:45.683]  You're probably right.
[01:38:45.703 --> 01:38:46.424]  I'm glad to hear that.
[01:38:46.765 --> 01:38:48.067]  Hey, one last quick thing.
[01:38:48.147 --> 01:38:51.912]  I was listening to Stan Monteith a week or so ago, and I forget who he was talking to.
[01:38:52.233 --> 01:38:55.878]  The subject of war came up in Iraq and what's going to happen to Iran and so forth.
[01:38:56.394 --> 01:39:02.299]  And Dr. Monteith made the comment that he thought that the United States is a superpower.
[01:39:02.339 --> 01:39:03.780]  We could pretty much corrupt anybody.
[01:39:04.521 --> 01:39:09.505]  I think two countries that would give us run for our money in a straight up war would definitely be China and Russia.
[01:39:09.866 --> 01:39:10.826]  What's your feelings on that?
[01:39:11.287 --> 01:39:12.748]  I'll let you go and answer that.
[01:39:12.808 --> 01:39:16.711]  The problem is the globalists own and control predominantly Russia and China.
[01:39:16.732 --> 01:39:17.192]  So it's like
[01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:20.512]  A triple Siamese twin, the U.S., Russia, China.
[01:39:20.932 --> 01:39:25.114]  So they start, if you start stabbing the twin next to you, you're stabbing your own blood supply.
[01:39:25.495 --> 01:39:26.535]  You're stabbing yourself.
[01:39:27.976 --> 01:39:42.545]  So, according to the Pentagon's new map and the futurist war planners that they really respond to and they support and they celebrate, China and Russia are buddies and are going to help police America and we're going to help police them.
[01:39:42.585 --> 01:39:43.205]  That's official.
[01:39:43.746 --> 01:39:44.646]  And then it's 65 countries
[01:39:46.559 --> 01:39:59.991]  Penax is 63 in quote the gap and the gap is basically if you look at a flat map of the world it's a big giant circle right in the middle it's the third world the equatorial countries and those a couple thousand miles either side of it
[01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:17.931]  and uh... it's the malaysia's and it's the african countries the nigeria's and it's the middle eastern countries and they've all got to be invaded and latin america needs to some areas need to be invaded and they have been invaded troops down there right now by the tens of thousands and so
[01:40:19.985 --> 01:40:23.087]  They play off this false bipolar world, and they say this in policy reports.
[01:40:23.107 --> 01:40:41.762]  They say, the people know there's a one world government, so we've got to act like there isn't, and basically play each other off against each other, building up police states in both poles of the false political system in the name of fighting each other, but really it's an excuse to build up our armaments to dominate the third world and domestic populations.
[01:40:44.369 --> 01:40:49.831]  Around 70% of the funding of our military goes into international conflicts, two-front wars.
[01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:54.733]  Around 30%, that number's growing, is for domestic suppression.
[01:40:55.313 --> 01:41:01.716]  You know, they're going to have CIA offices, already do, in major cities, military merging with the police, merging the National Guard with the police.
[01:41:01.736 --> 01:41:12.840]  You know, all the National Guard's going to give you their old command base, but they're going to still have an office in it, and have the emergency management center there with FEMA money, and then we're going to basically, through grants, have the cities and counties sign their authority away over to us.
[01:41:13.846 --> 01:41:16.687]  And they have little citizen tattletale squads and Homeland Security squads.
[01:41:16.707 --> 01:41:23.210]  We've had some of their directors and minions and volunteers at every level on and covered it in several of the films.
[01:41:24.591 --> 01:41:27.332]  So that's what's going on.
[01:41:31.214 --> 01:41:31.594]  Okay.
[01:41:32.114 --> 01:41:35.516]  Let's go ahead and go to Daryl in New Hampshire and that's going to be up for calls for a while because I've got to cover some news.
[01:41:35.536 --> 01:41:36.136]  Daryl, go ahead.
[01:41:38.237 --> 01:41:38.617]  Hello, Alex.
[01:41:40.218 --> 01:41:40.458]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:45.432]  Hey, uh, thanks for spreading the truth out there and liberating people's minds.
[01:41:45.492 --> 01:41:45.872]  Thanks, man.
[01:41:46.172 --> 01:41:46.512]  Thank you.
[01:41:46.552 --> 01:41:47.653]  Anything on your mind, sir?
[01:41:48.493 --> 01:41:49.513]  Um, I just don't know.
[01:41:49.633 --> 01:42:07.838]  Like, I'm in, like, a tiny suburban town where, like, there's, like, mad CEOs and all this stuff, and I'm sure that there are some of my involved, and I don't even know how to get myself, like, uh... I'm struggling, but I'm building my courage, and I think I'll see you out there.
[01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:10.223]  And everyone else.
[01:42:10.283 --> 01:42:17.147]  We're just going to have to not be afraid whatsoever, despite any consequence.
[01:42:18.648 --> 01:42:20.269]  Well, we better be afraid of not standing up.
[01:42:20.309 --> 01:42:23.791]  The consequences of doing nothing are much greater than the consequences of standing.
[01:42:25.132 --> 01:42:26.293]  It feels good to stand up.
[01:42:27.133 --> 01:42:29.675]  I'm tired of these psychopathic bullies trying to run our lives.
[01:42:29.695 --> 01:42:31.396]  It's good to hear that you're getting involved.
[01:42:31.456 --> 01:42:32.677]  First, you've got to inform yourself.
[01:42:33.117 --> 01:42:34.638]  Really get educated on the facts.
[01:42:35.345 --> 01:42:38.027]  Then you pick some issues, is one good way to do it, and get involved locally.
[01:42:38.047 --> 01:42:41.609]  You don't have to go, you know, defeat the New World Order overnight, defeat the dragon yourself.
[01:42:41.670 --> 01:42:44.772]  I mean, we have that Hollywood image of the superhero saving us.
[01:42:45.032 --> 01:42:47.153]  It's all of us, little things we do.
[01:42:47.173 --> 01:42:47.974]  It's the little people.
[01:42:48.755 --> 01:42:51.076]  The little man, like Alan Jackson's song.
[01:42:51.156 --> 01:42:52.777]  Thank God for the little man.
[01:42:52.797 --> 01:42:55.319]  Okay, now I'm really torturing people.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.741]  Let me get into some of the news here.
[01:42:59.201 --> 01:42:59.701]  Listen to this.
[01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:06.925]  Pentagon hired a contractor to advise on collecting information on churches, mosques, other U.S.
[01:43:06.965 --> 01:43:07.305]  sites.
[01:43:07.625 --> 01:43:16.330]  A Pentagon intelligence agency that kept files on American anti-war activists hired one of the contractors who bribed former Representative Randy Duke Cunningham, Republican of California.
[01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:17.891]  He's the guy that stole 800 plus million.
[01:43:17.911 --> 01:43:18.471]  He's pled guilty.
[01:43:19.091 --> 01:43:24.734]  To help and collect data on houses of worship, schools, power plants, and other locations in the United States.
[01:43:25.234 --> 01:43:26.455]  And it just goes into the spine.
[01:43:26.995 --> 01:43:28.256]  It is so massive.
[01:43:29.091 --> 01:43:29.992]  Here's another one.
[01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:34.254]  Advanced workers for Bush impersonated reporters.
[01:43:34.294 --> 01:43:35.394]  That's Washington Post.
[01:43:35.434 --> 01:43:39.356]  The White House said yesterday it will discipline two government employees who masqueraded as journalists.
[01:43:40.217 --> 01:43:40.737]  Sure they will.
[01:43:41.637 --> 01:43:46.460]  It's like the army recruiter that called up threatening people to go to prison if they didn't come join the military and sign the contract.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.501]  That's racketeering, by the way, and extortion.
[01:43:48.521 --> 01:43:51.302]  They're enforcing what they're doing.
[01:43:52.325 --> 01:43:55.167]  And they gave him a bonus and made him the head of a whole region.
[01:43:56.528 --> 01:44:02.613]  Just like the head of the Met Police who did the big cover-up shooting DeMendez 14 times.
[01:44:02.853 --> 01:44:04.315]  He's now getting a giant cash bonus.
[01:44:05.776 --> 01:44:10.660]  The FBI agents that ordered their underlings not to stop, quote, Al-Qaeda before 9-11, they got record cash bonuses.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.502]  The others got demoted to fire to try to stop Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:14.122 --> 01:44:18.546]  Mississippi couple whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and two men who later identified themselves as service agents
[01:44:19.289 --> 01:44:24.993]  ...pretended to be Fox News journalists, same thing, when surveying their neighborhood in advance of a March 8th visit from President Bush.
[01:44:25.013 --> 01:44:34.099]  Just another example of secret police everywhere, and they'll now be our new national police under the auspices of the Expanded Patriot Act.
[01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:35.960]  Here's a really scary article.
[01:44:37.861 --> 01:44:42.484]  MI5 helped IRA buy bomb parts in U.S.
[01:44:43.945 --> 01:44:48.708]  We have the related MI5, MI6 involvement in the IRA terrorism archive under that, that we posted there.
[01:44:49.682 --> 01:44:57.752]  And a link to Paul's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, a free chapter on it from the book British Intelligence, Her Majesty's Terrorist Network.
[01:44:58.152 --> 01:45:07.644]  A former British Army mole in the IRA has claimed that MI5 arranged weapons buying Crypto-America in which he obtained detonators later used by terrorists to murder soldiers.
[01:45:08.837 --> 01:45:09.778]  And police officers.
[01:45:09.798 --> 01:45:23.286]  In a book to be published next month, The Spy, he uses the pseudonym Kevin Fulton, describes in detail how the British intelligence cooperated with the FBI to ensure his trip to New York in the 1990s went ahead without incident so that his cover would not be blown.
[01:45:24.047 --> 01:45:27.489]  He goes on to talk about how he supplied the detonators used to carry out the bomb.
[01:45:27.509 --> 01:45:28.570]  Folks, they build the bombs.
[01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:30.531]  There's hundreds of articles and admissions.
[01:45:30.911 --> 01:45:33.533]  They go break people's legs and they refuse to carry out the bombing.
[01:45:33.793 --> 01:45:36.295]  In every case we looked at, they commanded the IRA.
[01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.689]  Hardliners.
[01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:42.651]  The British intel sat as the heads of the IRA.
[01:45:42.671 --> 01:45:51.174]  So this is just one new little cherry on top, or maybe a little nut on the sundae, of just hundreds of pieces that make this gourmet treat.
[01:45:52.615 --> 01:45:56.817]  On the anniversary of the invasion, Bush and Cheney see Iraq's successes.
[01:45:56.877 --> 01:46:02.539]  On the third anniversary of the war that they once expected to be over, by now, they said within six months guaranteed,
[01:46:03.775 --> 01:46:05.077]  They swore our troops would be home.
[01:46:05.477 --> 01:46:06.979]  They're on battle plans, said 20 years.
[01:46:07.399 --> 01:46:19.252]  President Bush and senior officials argued Sunday that their strategy was working despite escalating violence in Iraq, even as the former Iraqi Prime Minister, once favored by the White House, declared that a civil war had already started.
[01:46:20.593 --> 01:46:24.297]  And it goes on with their ridiculous quotes and Bush saying that
[01:46:25.276 --> 01:46:29.098]  Things are better now than they were, and we don't want to cut and run.
[01:46:29.618 --> 01:46:34.560]  The Pentagon's own plan is to have civil war and break that country up and stay there as long as possible.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.601]  We see it as a failure.
[01:46:35.641 --> 01:46:36.861]  The globalists see it as a victory.
[01:46:36.881 --> 01:46:40.563]  It's like the war on drugs is called a failure, if you believe what they claim it's for, it is.
[01:46:40.903 --> 01:46:49.047]  But no, if it's to get control, put your kids in prison, which the big cartels openly own, and then bring in the majority of the drugs themselves, then it's a great success.
[01:46:51.628 --> 01:46:53.649]  And I've made that point many times, so I will not belabor it.
[01:46:55.629 --> 01:46:58.011]  Impeach Bush chorus grows, London Times.
[01:46:58.671 --> 01:47:10.039]  The movement to impeach President George W. Bush over the war on terror began with a few tatty bumper stickers on the back of battered old Volvos and slogans such as, Bush lied, people died, on far left websites.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:19.646]  But as Democratic hopes rise of gaining control of Congress this autumn, dreams of impeaching Bush are no longer confined to his political fringe.
[01:47:19.706 --> 01:47:22.508]  I remember people thought we couldn't start the impeachment of Clinton, but we did.
[01:47:23.291 --> 01:47:29.573]  A poll last week found that voters, by 50% to 37% who are against, would prefer the Democrats to control Congress.
[01:47:30.033 --> 01:47:35.875]  If Bush opponents find themselves in opposition to power, the temptation to humiliate him is likely to be irresistible.
[01:47:37.355 --> 01:47:40.176]  And Ron Paul says they'll probably impeach him, but it'll just be political.
[01:47:40.196 --> 01:47:43.777]  I mean, then they'll oppose as our saviors while being for the exact same policies.
[01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.438]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:47:47.046 --> 01:47:51.029]  But Ron Paul and others have said it would probably be a good thing because anything to limit executive power is good.
[01:47:51.069 --> 01:47:53.671]  We're in danger of total open dictatorship.
[01:47:54.592 --> 01:47:56.954]  Small town provokes big outrage in Vermont.
[01:47:56.994 --> 01:48:04.619]  Vote to impeach Bush sparks backlash and they say that the majority of Vermonters of course want to impeach him but they're getting hate calls and letters from all over the country.
[01:48:06.381 --> 01:48:09.183]  Or the neocons, who are the minority but try to intimidate everybody.
[01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:12.237]  Chavez blasts Bush as donkey and drunkard.
[01:48:12.257 --> 01:48:14.918]  I don't know about him being a donkey, but he is a drunkard.
[01:48:15.278 --> 01:48:19.780]  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Sunday lobbed a litany of insults at U.S.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:25.503]  President Bush ranging from donkey to drunkard in response to White House report branding the left-wing leader a demagogue.
[01:48:26.143 --> 01:48:32.426]  Chavez is one of America's fiercest critics and has repeatedly accused the United States government of seeking to oust him from the presidency of Venezuela.
[01:48:32.726 --> 01:48:35.787]  The world's number five oil exporter and a supplier of around 50% of U.S.
[01:48:35.847 --> 01:48:36.628]  crude imports.
[01:48:37.008 --> 01:48:37.568]  They own Sitco.
[01:48:38.439 --> 01:48:42.440]  You are a donkey, Mr. Bush, said Chavez, speaking in English on his weekly Sunday broadcast.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.481]  You're an alcoholic, Mr. Danger.
[01:48:44.961 --> 01:48:50.503]  Or rather, you're a drunkard, Chavez said, referring to Bush by the nickname he frequently uses to describe the U.S.
[01:48:50.543 --> 01:48:50.863]  President.
[01:48:52.864 --> 01:48:53.964]  I gotta laugh at that.
[01:48:54.424 --> 01:48:55.465]  Pillaring Bush.
[01:48:56.105 --> 01:48:56.525]  Pillaring him.
[01:48:56.545 --> 01:48:59.626]  You know, that's where they put you in the stocks and throw rotten food at you.
[01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:03.608]  You know, the old movies where they show old play.
[01:49:03.628 --> 01:49:07.149]  People don't like the play or the comedy and they throw rotten cabbages and eggs.
[01:49:07.169 --> 01:49:07.869]  That's pillaring.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:12.143]  And, uh, this type of pilloring does nothing.
[01:49:13.844 --> 01:49:15.726]  And I guess it makes constituents happy.
[01:49:15.826 --> 01:49:16.526]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:49:16.546 --> 01:49:18.328]  He needs to be, that's what is effective.
[01:49:18.348 --> 01:49:20.409]  To describe how he's a titular, nothing.
[01:49:20.730 --> 01:49:21.550]  It's like Bill Clinton was.
[01:49:22.911 --> 01:49:25.033]  You get all caught up just attacking these people, it does nothing.
[01:49:26.835 --> 01:49:31.639]  Here it is, blundering Met Police Chief in line for 34,000 pounds, excuse me, I said dollar.
[01:49:32.079 --> 01:49:33.260]  So that's over, that's about 60,000 dollars.
[01:49:35.518 --> 01:49:36.759]  Cash bonus for doing a great job.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.281]  He's the guy that covered up the killing of DeMendez.
[01:49:40.202 --> 01:49:41.063]  A lot more coming up.
[01:49:41.083 --> 01:49:42.184]  We'll take a few more calls too.
[01:49:42.224 --> 01:49:50.031]  I'm going to go live until 8 after and then we'll come back and play the Charlie Sheen interview right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:50.071 --> 01:49:50.851]  This is Genesis.
[01:49:51.412 --> 01:49:53.073]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.434 --> 01:49:57.297]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.021 --> 01:49:59.302]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.522 --> 01:50:05.245]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.525 --> 01:50:10.788]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.068 --> 01:50:15.190]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:19.174]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.435 --> 01:50:24.080]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:26.943]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:27.243 --> 01:50:30.427]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.467 --> 01:50:32.309]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:51:01.323 --> 01:51:12.249]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.509 --> 01:51:14.311]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:51:14.591 --> 01:51:17.914]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:51:18.234 --> 01:51:28.683]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:51:28.983 --> 01:51:29.484]  That's right!
[01:51:29.664 --> 01:51:36.790]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:53:14.673 --> 01:53:14.973]  Get them!

[01:55:45.867 --> 01:55:46.787]  Who's up next in line?
[01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:56.871]  Well, what I'll do as soon as you get the call is straight, is I'll, because remember, they're up in Minnesota, folks, and I'm down here in Austin, Texas, so I always have to
[01:55:57.662 --> 01:56:00.424]  I could use the instant messenger, but I tend to be in the Stone Age here.
[01:56:01.304 --> 01:56:07.048]  So I always just have them tell me the names, I write them down and go to them, and then shuffle the papers and can't get to them.
[01:56:07.709 --> 01:56:09.750]  Mike in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:56:10.170 --> 01:56:19.096]  Yeah, how does the anthrax mailings and the smallpox scare and the West Nile virus follow up what 9-11 and what Charlie Sheen said?
[01:56:20.717 --> 01:56:24.179]  Well, we know the anthrax was a White House ordered op.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.401]  All of Bush's enemies got the letters.
[01:56:27.375 --> 01:56:36.042]  From the guy that did a story about his daughters falling down drunk, to people that, you know, the leader of the Senate, Daschle.
[01:56:37.163 --> 01:56:38.404]  And we know it was super U.S.
[01:56:38.444 --> 01:56:44.008]  designed, high-grade, $100 million piece of equipment it takes just to coat them in bentonite.
[01:56:44.068 --> 01:56:52.575]  They actually put little wings on each spore so they get picked up by the air and stay buoyant in the atmosphere for inhalation.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.104]  And we know he was on Cipro starting September 10th with his cabinet, Associated Press.
[01:56:59.124 --> 01:57:02.386]  Ari Fleischer, White House Press Secretary, also confirmed that when he was questioned.
[01:57:02.406 --> 01:57:03.927]  And we know that it came from Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[01:57:04.247 --> 01:57:06.689]  We know they tried to cover that up and claim somebody made it in their bathtub.
[01:57:07.469 --> 01:57:08.730]  So that was a government op.
[01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:10.191]  And then you mentioned, what else did you mention?
[01:57:11.652 --> 01:57:13.853]  They were saying that some columnist in Iowa was behind it.
[01:57:14.214 --> 01:57:14.534]  What was that?
[01:57:15.316 --> 01:57:16.036]  No, that wasn't true.
[01:57:16.577 --> 01:57:18.718]  They tried to claim it was Stephen Hadfield, too, and that wasn't true.
[01:57:18.738 --> 01:57:19.979]  Then you mentioned West Nile.
[01:57:20.419 --> 01:57:28.004]  West Nile, we know our government, in 1984, and then again in 1990, mailed that stuff to Saddam Hussein.
[01:57:28.104 --> 01:57:28.544]  And then again in 1994.
[01:57:28.624 --> 01:57:31.646]  And then they tried to claim he did it, which he didn't.
[01:57:31.666 --> 01:57:32.726]  We'll be right back.

[01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:51.871]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.592 --> 01:57:53.713]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.373 --> 01:57:55.174]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.934 --> 01:57:56.815]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.835 --> 01:58:01.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.658 --> 01:58:05.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.664 --> 01:58:09.324]  Welcome back.
[01:58:09.484 --> 01:58:13.107]  Now into the third and final hour of this live Monday edition.
[01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:17.110]  Because the server is overloaded and crashed,
[01:58:19.565 --> 01:58:22.726]  In the first hour with Charlie and some of our audience on the web.
[01:58:22.746 --> 01:58:25.567]  I was unable to hear it and people were requesting it and it didn't tune in.
[01:58:25.587 --> 01:58:29.768]  We're going to re-air that interview coming up here in the next segment so you do not want to miss it.
[01:58:30.028 --> 01:58:34.129]  Talking about 9-11 and several other issues and we'll be back on with us in the near future.
[01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:38.991]  Here is an article out of the London Telegraph today.
[01:58:39.131 --> 01:58:42.152]  Lifelong vaccine will end booster jab ordeal and it's
[01:58:42.924 --> 01:58:59.796]  Touted as the next best thing to slice bread, and it says that they give you the shot, and then the vaccine is a microcapsule of a type of compound similar to what they find in ancient fossilized ferns.
[01:59:01.217 --> 01:59:04.239]  Yes, and then it just slow releases the biological agent.
[01:59:04.519 --> 01:59:10.043]  Talk about, I mean, you talk about a deadly bio-weapon, and you spray everybody with this stuff, it's in them, and then at a certain point it
[01:59:12.586 --> 01:59:16.648]  I read they have these as bioweapons that get into your system and are already encapsulated.
[01:59:16.668 --> 01:59:21.990]  I heard about this exact science from sources long before it happened.
[01:59:22.630 --> 01:59:23.551]  Long before it was announced.
[01:59:23.611 --> 01:59:25.392]  It's incredible.
[01:59:25.412 --> 01:59:29.253]  And then you can hit it with a certain wavelength, certain resonance, break it loose, have it unfold.
[01:59:29.993 --> 01:59:31.534]  And this is really, really scary.
[01:59:31.674 --> 01:59:38.377]  I read another article a few years ago in the London Telegraph where, oh, they have vaccines they give you that have a viral attack of your brain.
[01:59:39.258 --> 01:59:49.732]  It says the virus goes in and creates plaques in the neuroreceptors, the electrochemical receptors, that would pick up nicotine or opiates or cocaine, any type of narcotic.
[01:59:50.333 --> 01:59:50.793]  I don't think so.
[02:00:14.914 --> 02:00:18.797]  We're designed to be good creatures at many levels.
[02:00:18.957 --> 02:00:20.699]  God gave us that to reward us when we do good.
[02:00:21.319 --> 02:00:29.465]  And so you feel good because your body produces its natural endorphins to supply you for doing good.
[02:00:31.427 --> 02:00:41.635]  Or you know, when you wanted to date that girl for years and you finally get her to go out with you and you have a great time and you're dropping her off, she gives you a kiss at the door, you get that good endorphin because that's a good thing you're doing.
[02:00:41.995 --> 02:00:43.276]  You're getting yourself a nice mate.
[02:00:44.477 --> 02:00:46.157]  Or vice versa for a woman towards a man.
[02:00:46.177 --> 02:00:49.018]  They just said, oh, there'll be a slight problem.
[02:00:49.038 --> 02:00:54.119]  It might hurt, you know, feeling good, but we can give you medication that'll counteract that.
[02:00:54.899 --> 02:00:57.500]  So take away your natural brain.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:58.280]  Oh, that sounds good.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:03.241]  A virus that attacks the neuroreceptors and creates plaques.
[02:01:04.042 --> 02:01:05.342]  How wonderful.
[02:01:06.735 --> 02:01:08.955]  I mean, everybody knows that's why narcotics are bad.
[02:01:08.975 --> 02:01:12.576]  It's because they burn out or jam up or fill your normal receptors.
[02:01:12.596 --> 02:01:13.877]  After a while, they can come back.
[02:01:14.357 --> 02:01:15.057]  But not with this.
[02:01:15.117 --> 02:01:16.737]  Not with the viral attack.
[02:01:16.777 --> 02:01:19.618]  The whole new class of bioweapons is what they are.
[02:01:19.658 --> 02:01:20.658]  And oh, your child needs it.
[02:01:20.698 --> 02:01:22.898]  You don't want them to get hooked on cocaine.
[02:01:22.918 --> 02:01:27.139]  6,000 Americans out of 300 million people die every year from illegal drugs.
[02:01:27.159 --> 02:01:28.240]  That's the official government numbers.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:34.441]  The conservative numbers, what they admit for dying from prescription drugs, just bad reactions.
[02:01:35.353 --> 02:01:36.474]  Or drug interactions is 130,000.
[02:01:37.194 --> 02:01:53.023]  And of course, many... I mean, go read the adverse reactions to all of the big pharma drugs, which aren't even... And again, they're never a natural plant or natural drug, because then they can't have a patent on it.
[02:01:54.104 --> 02:02:01.528]  All the stuff they make is totally synthetic, mainly out of petrochemicals, so that then they can hold a certain patent on a new creation.
[02:02:01.548 --> 02:02:02.329]  It has to be synthetic.
[02:02:03.346 --> 02:02:11.872]  So that's why illegal drugs are so much worse than even the very destructive, round-of-the-mill, garden variety, literal garden narcotics.
[02:02:12.512 --> 02:02:13.853]  Opium from the poppy.
[02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:15.674]  Cocaine from the coca leaf.
[02:02:16.935 --> 02:02:17.676]  Things of that nature.
[02:02:18.196 --> 02:02:19.977]  Tobacco from North Carolina.
[02:02:21.398 --> 02:02:22.419]  Hit the same receptors.
[02:02:23.279 --> 02:02:24.060]  Very chilling.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.782]  Websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:27.062 --> 02:02:30.104]  Coming up later this afternoon, we'll have an article out on the Charlie Sheen bombshell interview.
[02:02:30.644 --> 02:02:31.925]  We'll have it posted up there for you as well.
[02:02:32.836 --> 02:02:34.879]  Right now, we'll see if we smoke the servers again.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:36.962]  Go ahead and roll on the other side.
[02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:38.464]  Be sure and stay with us.
[02:02:38.524 --> 02:02:42.189]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:46.437 --> 02:02:49.280]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.121]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.462 --> 02:02:56.146]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.487 --> 02:03:03.213]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.553 --> 02:03:05.515]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:05.735 --> 02:03:08.558]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.678 --> 02:03:13.322]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.542 --> 02:03:17.946]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.186 --> 02:03:25.413]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.653 --> 02:03:28.075]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:45.535 --> 02:03:49.017]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.297 --> 02:03:52.799]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.879 --> 02:03:56.822]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:57.042 --> 02:04:03.205]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.605 --> 02:04:11.530]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:17.274]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.434 --> 02:04:21.196]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.577 --> 02:04:23.418]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:23.478 --> 02:04:25.659]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:05:45.916 --> 02:05:51.943]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.564 --> 02:05:55.608]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.110 --> 02:06:02.275]  He's been in over 65 major motion pictures, produced them, written them.
[02:06:03.577 --> 02:06:05.940]  From Platoon to Red Dawn, one of my favorites.
[02:06:07.702 --> 02:06:10.444]  And of course, TV shows like Spin City.
[02:06:10.724 --> 02:06:15.648]  Right now he's the major star on the CBS program Two and a Half Men.
[02:06:16.489 --> 02:06:20.672]  And he's got several new movies coming out this year and next year.
[02:06:21.633 --> 02:06:25.196]  And when I got a chance to talk to Charlie Sheen, I was just amazed.
[02:06:25.236 --> 02:06:27.558]  Because I've talked to a lot of other big Hollywood people.
[02:06:27.578 --> 02:06:28.659]  We've had a few of them on this show.
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:30.041]  Yes, we are.
[02:06:43.983 --> 02:06:48.566]  Really knows what's going on on the planet today, but that shouldn't surprise me.
[02:06:48.606 --> 02:06:52.368]  His father, Martin Sheen, has been on the front lines.
[02:06:53.208 --> 02:06:57.430]  As Mark Twain said in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[02:06:57.450 --> 02:07:02.673]  But in time, when his cause exceeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:07:03.053 --> 02:07:04.974]  And, of course, has been proven right time and time again.
[02:07:05.014 --> 02:07:05.655]  It was his father.
[02:07:06.715 --> 02:07:11.976]  In the days leading up to the war, he was the most vocal spokesman in America against this disastrous conflict.
[02:07:12.016 --> 02:07:13.296]  Everything he said has now come true.
[02:07:13.776 --> 02:07:24.518]  And of course, Charlie Sheen and his brother are also activists in their own right, and we are just incredibly honored to have Charlie Sheen on with us for the balance of this hour.
[02:07:24.558 --> 02:07:25.679]  Mr. Sheen, good to have you with us.
[02:07:26.219 --> 02:07:27.059]  Nice to be here, Alex.
[02:07:27.079 --> 02:07:27.479]  How are you?
[02:07:28.279 --> 02:07:29.139]  I'm great.
[02:07:29.579 --> 02:07:32.880]  Before we get into the really serious stuff, tell me a little bit about Two and a Half Men.
[02:07:33.815 --> 02:07:35.617]  Well, gosh, we're thrilled.
[02:07:36.437 --> 02:07:38.359]  We are at the end of our third season.
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:43.223]  We have three more shows to shoot.
[02:07:43.343 --> 02:07:52.911]  Most sitcoms will shoot 22 episodes, but because the network always wants more product, we do 24.
[02:07:53.812 --> 02:07:57.635]  So our season will continue when all the other shows have shut down.
[02:07:58.656 --> 02:07:59.357]  But it's going good.
[02:07:59.417 --> 02:08:00.277]  It's going really good.
[02:08:01.957 --> 02:08:13.246]  We've, you know, found ourselves sort of in or around the top ten for most of this year and we found out we got picked up for next season, which is fabulous.
[02:08:14.467 --> 02:08:27.377]  And what's happening is they're using our show to launch new shows, which is the sign of great confidence and trust in us sort of being the anchor of that Monday night lineup, you know?
[02:08:29.230 --> 02:08:32.872]  So with that, I should probably throw out a shameless plug on tonight's show.
[02:08:32.892 --> 02:08:34.733]  If that's alright.
[02:08:34.813 --> 02:08:36.114]  Oh sure, tell us about tonight's show.
[02:08:36.774 --> 02:08:42.357]  Tonight's show is entitled, it's entitled, The Spit-Covered Cobbler.
[02:08:43.237 --> 02:08:48.660]  And it's funny because the title of our show will always relate to a line of dialogue.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:56.564]  And so, it's about my brother Alan, played by John Cryer, and he's dating a girl who has no money.
[02:08:57.242 --> 02:09:00.463]  And so, he doesn't have any money himself.
[02:09:01.023 --> 02:09:06.664]  I sort of support him on the show because I took him in when he went through a divorce with his kid, played by Angus Jones, right?
[02:09:07.785 --> 02:09:12.826]  And so, he's dealing with a woman, April Bowlby, who plays Candy on the show.
[02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:16.747]  And she's fabulous and she's beautiful, but she's broke.
[02:09:17.107 --> 02:09:17.967]  Imagine that, right?
[02:09:18.647 --> 02:09:24.449]  So, John is forced to pick up the tab for a lot of her bills.
[02:09:26.644 --> 02:09:28.367]  That leads to some pretty funny scenarios.
[02:09:29.049 --> 02:09:30.812]  What time is that showing this evening?
[02:09:31.533 --> 02:09:34.578]  It's on CBS, 9 o'clock, 8 central.
[02:09:35.039 --> 02:09:36.302]  Alright, well I'll have to tune into that.
[02:09:36.983 --> 02:09:38.465]  Now, Mr. Sheen,
[02:09:39.571 --> 02:09:58.256]  You have some questions about the official 9-11 story, and we got hooked up because we both mutually have been looking into that, and I wanted just to, I guess, start by what happened on 9-11, what your instincts told you, and really just go from there.
[02:09:59.476 --> 02:10:03.617]  Well, it was interesting, and let me just preface that by saying that
[02:10:05.256 --> 02:10:31.640]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time and I've been following you and I've seen all of your documentaries and your research is tireless and it's interesting because a lot of these guys you sort of look behind the notes and you start to discover inconsistencies in a lot of the claims that they're making which pretty much torpedoes the credibility of most of their substance but
[02:10:32.409 --> 02:10:34.672]  With you, that's not the case.
[02:10:35.072 --> 02:10:41.200]  And I was always amazed to see that you always had hard data to back up your claims.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:50.832]  And so, you know, this is tough for me because for the longest time I've been doing my own independent research and
[02:10:52.159 --> 02:11:10.832]  You know, I don't claim to be an expert in any of these fields, but just as a concerned, upstanding, tax-paying American citizen, there's just... There's questions I have that I wish somebody could explain away for me.
[02:11:11.473 --> 02:11:18.658]  There's things that one will view, and then look at the King Commission's official report, and it just...
[02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:27.395]  As I heard somebody once say, might have been you, there's holes in the story you could fly a Boeing jet through.
[02:11:27.415 --> 02:11:29.257]  Oh, there certainly is.
[02:11:29.337 --> 02:11:35.822]  In fact, we were talking yesterday and you said over the phone that the biggest conspiracy theory is the official story.
[02:11:35.862 --> 02:11:39.165]  I mean, at every point, it's a fabrication.
[02:11:39.485 --> 02:11:40.046]  It's a lie.
[02:11:40.086 --> 02:11:41.007]  Would you elaborate on that?
[02:11:41.887 --> 02:11:45.070]  Well, yeah, it's like they want to just pigeonhole
[02:11:45.791 --> 02:12:12.359]  all of us into this group of conspiracy nutbags uh... when we're not really debating things that are related to UFOs uh... bringing down the towers or building seven or the pentagon right and so uh... it's just uh... you know it just feels like uh... you know there's there's things in there that that
[02:12:12.887 --> 02:12:16.852]  We're not the conspiracy theorists on this particular issue.
[02:12:17.393 --> 02:12:26.906]  It seems to me like 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over 4 commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets
[02:12:28.593 --> 02:12:30.214]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:30.474 --> 02:12:35.375]  Well, I tell you, back in 2001, everybody admits that cell phones didn't work over 3,000 feet.
[02:12:35.395 --> 02:12:37.096]  How were they working at 33,000, 32,000 feet?
[02:12:37.156 --> 02:12:41.077]  How did Al-Qaeda make NORAD stand down?
[02:12:41.097 --> 02:12:46.779]  Did Al-Qaeda call Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, as the Chronicle reported, and say, don't fly to New York?
[02:12:46.859 --> 02:12:47.879]  No, the White House did.
[02:12:49.339 --> 02:12:52.520]  Did Al-Qaeda call Salman Rushdie and say don't fly to New York on September 11th?
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:55.201]  No, The Times of London reported that the White House did.
[02:12:55.361 --> 02:13:06.384]  Did Al-Qaeda run drills, CIA and the Pentagon drills on the morning of 9-11 of hijacked jets hitting those exact same targets at those exact same times and then drills the day before and drills two weeks before?
[02:13:06.404 --> 02:13:11.166]  Yeah, the answer to that would be probably not.
[02:13:15.382 --> 02:13:29.820]  No, it's just that the more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events around the fateful day, it just raises a lot of questions.
[02:13:30.201 --> 02:13:33.906]  There's a lot of questions, and I know that a couple of years ago,
[02:13:34.668 --> 02:13:39.271]  It was, you know, severely unpopular to discuss any of this.
[02:13:40.811 --> 02:13:50.677]  But it sort of feels like, just in my research, and in the people that I talk to, and in and around my circles, it seems like a worm is turning.
[02:13:51.757 --> 02:14:00.422]  Because you start talking about this, even with conservative Republicans, and they can't really debate away
[02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:06.053]  Some of the most obvious facts on that day.
[02:14:06.253 --> 02:14:08.375]  Let me ask my radio producer a question.
[02:14:08.775 --> 02:14:10.877]  Did you find that clip of Dan Rather?
[02:14:12.198 --> 02:14:19.123]  Let me just roll this little 30 second clip because this is what Dan Rather thought about 20 seconds after Building 7 collapsed.
[02:14:19.504 --> 02:14:22.466]  They backed the tape up and played it and this is what he said live.
[02:14:22.486 --> 02:14:23.147]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:14:23.747 --> 02:14:25.869]  And again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[02:14:27.757 --> 02:14:31.541]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[02:14:31.581 --> 02:14:33.783]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[02:14:34.844 --> 02:14:38.767]  It's amazing, incredible picture work.
[02:14:39.728 --> 02:14:50.498]  For the third time today, reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:55.393]  All right, so there's Dan Rather, and that's what I thought that morning.
[02:14:55.433 --> 02:15:00.658]  That's what engineers, the heads of engineering colleges, that's what a lot of people said.
[02:15:01.559 --> 02:15:02.960]  Charlie, what did you think on that morning?
[02:15:04.822 --> 02:15:07.744]  Well, where do we start?
[02:15:08.024 --> 02:15:16.492]  I was up early, actually, and we were going to do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do.
[02:15:18.084 --> 02:15:25.850]  And so, gosh, I was up and I was watching the news and the North Tower was burning.
[02:15:26.770 --> 02:15:34.216]  And so, you know, the world was focused on what I guess they were assuming to be pilot error, right?
[02:15:34.256 --> 02:15:37.018]  Or some tragedy nobody could really explain.
[02:15:37.038 --> 02:15:41.161]  And so I saw the South Tower hit live.
[02:15:42.462 --> 02:15:46.925]  That famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building and then we see the tremendous fireball, you know?
[02:15:48.031 --> 02:15:56.793]  Um, and it was just a, there was a feeling that, uh, it just didn't look... How do I say this?
[02:15:57.113 --> 02:16:03.814]  Um, it didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.
[02:16:04.174 --> 02:16:15.977]  Um, and then when the buildings came down, later on that day, I was with my brother, I was at my parents' house, and, um, we were out on the deck, and I said, hey, call me insane.
[02:16:16.730 --> 02:16:22.411]  But did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[02:16:22.431 --> 02:16:29.493]  And he said, well, kind of, but gosh, that's impossible if you think about what it would take for them to orchestrate that.
[02:16:30.693 --> 02:16:37.615]  And so, as the days and the weeks went on, I was sort of told what to believe.
[02:16:37.935 --> 02:16:41.756]  And I was told through mainstream media and all of the talking heads
[02:16:42.481 --> 02:16:43.563]  About what really happened.
[02:16:58.565 --> 02:16:58.825]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:58.885 --> 02:17:02.287]  Of course, but what bothers me even more about all of this is that all of this stuff exists from day one.
[02:17:02.307 --> 02:17:04.928]  If you start looking at all of the news reporting after day one,
[02:17:17.772 --> 02:17:24.778]  Um, the official story starts to find its way into our consciousness.
[02:17:24.878 --> 02:17:26.940]  They start telling us the conspiracy theory.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.623]  The conspiracy theorists in the government start telling us their wild-eyed conspiracies.
[02:17:31.364 --> 02:17:31.804]  Exactly.
[02:17:33.145 --> 02:17:37.209]  And so we all go away from what we felt in our gut initially.
[02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:38.870]  Charlie Sheen, stay right there.
[02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:39.611]  We've got a break.
[02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:40.512]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:40.932 --> 02:17:41.993]  Folks, strap yourselves in.
[02:17:45.791 --> 02:17:47.392]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:47.532 --> 02:17:51.635]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:51.775 --> 02:17:54.657]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:54.737 --> 02:18:01.441]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:01.641 --> 02:18:04.643]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:04.843 --> 02:18:07.225]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:07.365 --> 02:18:12.068]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:18:12.248 --> 02:18:26.842]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Apcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:18:27.003 --> 02:18:33.669]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-8888.
[02:18:40.854 --> 02:18:48.299]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.699 --> 02:18:54.182]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.743 --> 02:18:55.263]  That's right.
[02:18:55.563 --> 02:18:57.844]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:59.245 --> 02:19:05.329]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:05.891 --> 02:19:13.578]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.018 --> 02:19:18.883]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.503 --> 02:19:22.526]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.308 --> 02:19:29.434]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:29.815 --> 02:19:30.055]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.075 --> 02:19:32.018]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.078 --> 02:19:32.398]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:32.699 --> 02:19:32.959]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.225 --> 02:19:47.626]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.166 --> 02:19:57.830]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:19:57.850 --> 02:20:02.532]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:20:03.312 --> 02:20:07.957]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[02:20:08.758 --> 02:20:17.306]  This is the same New World Order called for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[02:20:19.968 --> 02:20:27.734]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:27.974 --> 02:20:29.796]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.816 --> 02:20:30.256]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.276 --> 02:20:30.656]  Call now.
[02:20:30.676 --> 02:20:33.318]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:45.237 --> 02:20:46.917]  What causes foods to spoil?
[02:20:47.337 --> 02:20:50.318]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[02:20:50.638 --> 02:20:55.939]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[02:20:56.239 --> 02:21:05.761]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors, and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[02:21:06.041 --> 02:21:08.242]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[02:21:08.542 --> 02:21:12.085]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:21:12.345 --> 02:21:15.567]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:21:15.847 --> 02:21:19.390]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says, You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:23.013]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:21:23.153 --> 02:21:24.414]  I'm really amazed.
[02:21:24.574 --> 02:21:30.418]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:21:30.558 --> 02:21:32.980]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:41.446]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODORS.
[02:21:41.626 --> 02:21:43.627]  That's 1-866-NO-ODORS.
[02:21:45.148 --> 02:21:49.191]  Well, I'll walk back down.
[02:21:49.611 --> 02:21:52.333]  No, we're not backing down.
[02:21:52.573 --> 02:21:55.295]  I'll walk back down.
[02:22:02.865 --> 02:22:04.148]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:09.838]  There are those attempting to break down the sovereignty and the freedoms that are in this country, and they're failing.
[02:22:10.258 --> 02:22:14.105]  More and more Americans, as Charlie Chase said, are waking up.
[02:22:14.145 --> 02:22:15.608]  The worm has turned.
[02:22:16.583 --> 02:22:23.809]  And I was talking to Charlie yesterday and I talked about how when I brought up my facts on 9-11 just days after it happened, a lot of people disagree with me.
[02:22:23.889 --> 02:22:28.232]  Now, not just on my own broadcast, but on so many other shows, really no one calls in to disagree.
[02:22:28.252 --> 02:22:32.556]  Many of you as listeners in your local area have heard me on your local station with a talk show host attacking me.
[02:22:32.996 --> 02:22:34.317]  And everyone calls into my defense.
[02:22:34.637 --> 02:22:37.939]  So people instinctively know that something is wrong.
[02:22:38.439 --> 02:22:39.900]  And 9-11 is just part of that.
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:49.225]  We're talking to, of course, a legendary actor, star of screen and of course television, poet and writer, you name it, and Charlie Sheen.
[02:22:49.245 --> 02:22:52.107]  Charlie, there's so many facets of 9-11, but what about WTC7?
[02:22:53.861 --> 02:22:55.722]  I mean, it wasn't even hit by a building.
[02:22:55.742 --> 02:22:58.825]  47 story structure, has two small fires in it.
[02:22:59.445 --> 02:23:02.228]  A modern steel building, it never collapsed from fire.
[02:23:02.688 --> 02:23:08.854]  The Madrid fire last year, it burned for two days with 150, you know, something foot wide hot flames and nothing collapsed there.
[02:23:09.254 --> 02:23:10.795]  What happened with building 7 in your opinion?
[02:23:10.816 --> 02:23:12.357]  A little curious, isn't it?
[02:23:13.379 --> 02:23:14.340]  It's a little bit curious.
[02:23:16.361 --> 02:23:30.070]  It just seems odd that an event, something that we all witness, because September 11th wasn't the Zapruder Film, it was the Zapruder Film Festival, okay?
[02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:32.371]  And I think that
[02:23:34.427 --> 02:23:41.514]  What was the great Hoover quote about the bigger the lie, the easier it is to pass over on people?
[02:23:41.754 --> 02:23:42.015]  Yes.
[02:23:42.655 --> 02:23:43.856]  I mangled it.
[02:23:43.957 --> 02:23:44.657]  I'm paraphrasing.
[02:23:44.677 --> 02:23:47.660]  Hitler had a similar one about the bigger the lie, the more they'll buy it.
[02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:48.361]  Sure.
[02:23:48.441 --> 02:23:48.921]  There you go.
[02:23:48.941 --> 02:23:57.009]  Let me just throw out a quote just because we're 20 minutes into this and I'm sure I'm being demonized across the nation by all of the
[02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:00.873]  People that do that sort of thing.
[02:24:00.893 --> 02:24:04.736]  But people see through the propaganda organs now like they never have before.
[02:24:04.756 --> 02:24:05.577]  Well, good.
[02:24:06.017 --> 02:24:06.878]  Good, finally.
[02:24:07.899 --> 02:24:08.899]  There's a couple of quotes here.
[02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:16.086]  The first is, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the President or anyone else.
[02:24:16.886 --> 02:24:24.633]  The second quote from the same gentleman is that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile,
[02:24:25.151 --> 02:24:27.372]  But is morally treasonable to the American public.
[02:24:27.852 --> 02:24:28.633]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:31.054]  Yes, well I mean that's what the Founding Fathers said.
[02:24:31.114 --> 02:24:32.634]  It's our job to be watchdogs.
[02:24:32.654 --> 02:24:37.076]  The Declaration of Independence clearly states that in our seminal founding document.
[02:24:38.057 --> 02:24:38.457]  Absolutely.
[02:24:38.931 --> 02:24:45.317]  Yeah, and we've been coerced away from these founding principles.
[02:24:45.478 --> 02:24:53.366]  We've been told you're either with us or you're with the terrorists, and we've been told never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning 9-11.
[02:24:53.426 --> 02:24:54.747]  Bush said that at the U.N.
[02:24:55.207 --> 02:24:55.628]  Yes, he did.
[02:24:56.255 --> 02:24:56.755]  Yes, he did.
[02:24:56.895 --> 02:25:00.897]  That would direct the blame away from those responsible, blah, blah, blah.
[02:25:02.177 --> 02:25:04.258]  Back to Building 7, yeah.
[02:25:04.458 --> 02:25:14.782]  You pointed out in one of your documentaries that in a classic controlled demolition that they create what's first called a crease, is that correct?
[02:25:14.982 --> 02:25:15.882]  Or a wrinkle?
[02:25:16.662 --> 02:25:19.663]  A crease, wrinkle, cramp, all those are used, yes.
[02:25:19.703 --> 02:25:20.844]  They blow the central column.
[02:25:21.344 --> 02:25:24.325]  Right, and the term pull is about pulling
[02:25:25.009 --> 02:25:27.510]  The outer walls toward the center of the building, correct?
[02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:27.890]  Yes.
[02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:34.212]  So you minimize the damage, and that way you bring a building down on its own footprint.
[02:25:35.292 --> 02:25:35.632]  Correct.
[02:25:35.852 --> 02:25:40.633]  And many controlled demolition experts said they've never seen a prettier job than building something.
[02:25:40.673 --> 02:25:41.374]  Yeah, gosh.
[02:25:41.534 --> 02:25:45.895]  And there was a guy, I can't remember his name, but scientifically he broke down
[02:25:46.582 --> 02:25:53.647]  That the building actually fell faster than the speed of gravity because of the explosive vacuum that was created.
[02:25:54.227 --> 02:26:05.695]  Well, a lot of different physicists, a physics professor at BYU, Stephen Jones has done that, Underwriting Laboratories, Kevin Ryan, who was there.
[02:26:05.835 --> 02:26:07.096]  That guy got fired, right?
[02:26:07.296 --> 02:26:09.757]  Yes, he said we did our own test, and it's impossible.
[02:26:09.797 --> 02:26:12.219]  Steel doesn't melt until thousands of degrees.
[02:26:12.699 --> 02:26:15.641]  Around 3,000 it weakens, and jet fuel burns at 1,200 to 1,400.
[02:26:15.761 --> 02:26:16.881]  It's impossible.
[02:26:17.302 --> 02:26:19.943]  Well, that's 1,200 at optimum conditions.
[02:26:20.583 --> 02:26:20.824]  Yes.
[02:26:23.185 --> 02:26:31.189]  Yeah, and then you've got Silverstein, the leaseholder, the owner of 7, as well as the rest of the complex, right?
[02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:34.131]  On tape, on the record,
[02:26:34.844 --> 02:26:35.265]  Same.
[02:26:35.825 --> 02:26:41.350]  We've had such a terrible loss of life that day and I made the decision that they should go ahead and pull it.
[02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:43.432]  And we gave the order and watched the building come down?
[02:26:43.852 --> 02:26:44.172]  Yeah.
[02:26:45.574 --> 02:26:52.159]  Well, pull is the... I mean, that's just coming to the demo world as action and cut to the movie world.
[02:26:52.379 --> 02:27:00.607]  In fact, in the same PBS documentary narrated by Kevin Spacey, or not Kevin Spacey, the other guy, he comes right out and says
[02:27:02.087 --> 02:27:07.730]  They cut to one of the other engineers demoing a building and he says we're getting ready to pull it.
[02:27:08.650 --> 02:27:09.271]  And then they pull it.
[02:27:09.291 --> 02:27:16.714]  We're going to come back in fact and play some of those clips on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:16.774 --> 02:27:20.675]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:20.695 --> 02:27:23.016]  We're talking to Charlie Sheen.
[02:27:23.477 --> 02:27:28.159]  We're very honored to have him and of course I'm flattered that he likes the documentaries.
[02:27:28.479 --> 02:27:28.879]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.447 --> 02:27:38.448]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.368 --> 02:27:42.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.371 --> 02:27:49.432]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:49.652 --> 02:27:53.034]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.214 --> 02:27:56.695]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:56.952 --> 02:28:00.155]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.175 --> 02:28:05.700]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:15.369]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:15.489 --> 02:28:16.870]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:28:16.890 --> 02:28:22.275]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:22.771 --> 02:28:27.216]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.296 --> 02:28:28.657]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:28.817 --> 02:28:32.281]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:28:32.301 --> 02:28:33.282]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:28:45.234 --> 02:28:47.195]  You've asked for them, and now they're here!
[02:28:47.295 --> 02:28:57.998]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.378 --> 02:29:02.900]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:14.304]  When used, water flows through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.884 --> 02:29:21.732]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.132 --> 02:29:24.275]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:24.775 --> 02:29:29.721]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:30.041 --> 02:29:36.784]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.984 --> 02:29:40.585]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:40.825 --> 02:29:41.566]  That's toll free.
[02:29:41.586 --> 02:29:41.626]  888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.527 --> 02:29:49.972]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:50.252 --> 02:29:53.836]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:53.976 --> 02:30:02.125]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:30:02.365 --> 02:30:07.991]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:30:08.291 --> 02:30:13.536]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:13.796 --> 02:30:15.878]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:30:16.138 --> 02:30:28.310]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:28.530 --> 02:30:32.952]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:33.172 --> 02:30:34.133]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:34.293 --> 02:30:35.934]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:36.054 --> 02:30:37.834]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:38.095 --> 02:30:39.015]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:39.055 --> 02:30:41.536]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:30:41.636 --> 02:30:50.741]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:51.441 --> 02:30:53.742]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.831 --> 02:31:01.573]  Well, he comes from a family of actors, and he's one of the most accomplished.
[02:31:01.613 --> 02:31:02.734]  He's Charlie Sheen.
[02:31:03.474 --> 02:31:04.515]  They're also activists.
[02:31:06.036 --> 02:31:18.142]  And he has starred in over 65 major films, got a couple new ones coming out this year, and of course, he'll be on tonight, 8 o'clock, Central Time on CBS for Two and a Half Men, which he is the main star of the show on.
[02:31:18.162 --> 02:31:26.307]  But he joins us today to talk about, well, just the state of the world, and some of the interesting things that are happening, and some of the foundational events that are the
[02:31:27.054 --> 02:31:29.617]  Pretext for our new way of life.
[02:31:30.277 --> 02:31:31.579]  America changed, they told us.
[02:31:31.639 --> 02:31:32.740]  Give up all your freedoms.
[02:31:33.160 --> 02:31:36.383]  Freedom equals safety or security.
[02:31:39.818 --> 02:31:41.299]  What's the new definition of freedom?
[02:31:41.379 --> 02:31:43.460]  It's surveillance and not having freedom.
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:46.441]  So it's a lot of double-speak and double-think.
[02:31:46.622 --> 02:31:49.043]  And Charlie Sheen again is our guest.
[02:31:49.403 --> 02:31:50.604]  I want to play a clip.
[02:31:50.664 --> 02:31:57.447]  He mentioned this clip from America Rebuilds, a 2002 PBS documentary.
[02:31:57.607 --> 02:31:59.928]  And it is narrated by Kevin Spacey.
[02:32:00.369 --> 02:32:05.231]  And here is Larry Silverstein, the owner, who took out $7 million of insurance on the two towers.
[02:32:05.711 --> 02:32:08.593]  And he's also now bought the Sears Tower and taken out a bunch of insurance.
[02:32:10.134 --> 02:32:16.817]  Governor Pataki just called him the lowest of the low in the newspaper because he's holding out for a billion more now.
[02:32:17.237 --> 02:32:23.000]  Interesting fellow, made out quite well, and here is his statement from America Rebuilds.
[02:32:23.661 --> 02:32:29.944]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:32:29.964 --> 02:32:33.506]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:36.503]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[02:32:37.906 --> 02:32:39.468]  And they made that decision to pull.
[02:32:39.789 --> 02:32:42.954]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[02:32:43.414 --> 02:32:45.698]  They made the decision to pull.
[02:32:46.239 --> 02:32:46.900]  They made.
[02:32:47.461 --> 02:32:48.663]  They made the decision.
[02:32:49.355 --> 02:33:05.824]  And this building with two small fires implodes perfectly, and then there's video from every angle of the squibs, or the blast points, where the plastic explosives are detonating, and you see the ejection ports, you see the blast points, just like when you watch a Las Vegas demolition.
[02:33:06.044 --> 02:33:08.405]  They just had a demolition over the weekend in Fort Worth.
[02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:11.326]  We have video and photos of that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:11.366 --> 02:33:12.327]  Fell just like seven.
[02:33:12.607 --> 02:33:14.248]  The blast, the squibs,
[02:33:15.128 --> 02:33:20.011]  Then the crimp in the middle, the top of the building imploding downwards, and then it falls in on itself.
[02:33:21.171 --> 02:33:26.514]  Going back to our guest, Mr. Sheen, that is the clip you mentioned with Mr. Silverstein.
[02:33:26.934 --> 02:33:29.055]  Yes it is, yeah.
[02:33:29.415 --> 02:33:31.216]  Let me just play devil's advocate for a second, right?
[02:33:34.698 --> 02:33:38.200]  Again, I don't claim to be an expert about structural integrity.
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:40.341]  I don't claim to be an expert about demolitions.
[02:33:41.525 --> 02:33:50.460]  Could they have rigged that building during the day when they decided that the fire was out of hand, even though it was only in a couple of floors?
[02:33:50.641 --> 02:33:51.041]  No way!
[02:33:51.061 --> 02:33:52.964]  They could have blown the whole thing to bits!
[02:33:53.781 --> 02:33:58.243]  Well, the engineers that have looked at it, who aren't on government payroll, have said just what you're saying.
[02:33:58.283 --> 02:34:01.864]  The heads of mining colleges, the heads of physics departments, the heads of
[02:34:16.189 --> 02:34:19.930]  Let me ask you though, how long did it take to start an investigation after, I don't know, Pearl Harbor?
[02:34:44.853 --> 02:34:45.353]  About a day.
[02:34:45.373 --> 02:34:48.075]  Okay, uh, the Titanic.
[02:34:49.136 --> 02:34:50.117]  It started that day.
[02:34:50.957 --> 02:34:51.638]  Uh, JFK.
[02:34:52.338 --> 02:34:52.998]  Started that day.
[02:34:53.479 --> 02:34:54.900]  Yeah, uh, 9-11?
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.261]  Started about a year later.
[02:34:57.902 --> 02:34:58.082]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.931 --> 02:35:02.953]  Yeah, and then the investigation was ordered to be limited in its scope?
[02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:12.338]  Well, they had armed guards over every piece of steel and put GPS equipment on each piece, and if a guy pulled over to get a hamburger for ten minutes, he'd be fired and then criminally charged.
[02:35:12.378 --> 02:35:15.499]  That's what they actually did, and they shipped it to China under guard.
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:26.185]  Yeah, well, that bothers me because Giuliani, as a former prosecutor, knows the value of evidence preservation and crime scene preservation.
[02:35:27.495 --> 02:35:37.901]  I understand that they were on the clock, and they were still looking for victims, and they were still looking for bodies, and they were still hoping, beyond hope, that there were survivors, but... But not a week into it, not a month into it.
[02:35:38.481 --> 02:35:39.262]  No, I know.
[02:35:40.042 --> 02:35:40.362]  I know.
[02:35:40.683 --> 02:35:49.788]  So, the thing that I can't get my mind off of is that if there's a problem with Building 7, there's a problem with the whole thing.
[02:35:50.623 --> 02:35:51.143]  Well, you're right.
[02:35:51.183 --> 02:35:53.023]  What about firefighters on record?
[02:35:53.083 --> 02:36:00.745]  Major newspapers say they found three of the voice recorders, data recorders, and then the FBI said, don't tell anybody about this, and shipped them off.
[02:36:01.705 --> 02:36:03.825]  Yeah, and we've never had access to that data, have we?
[02:36:04.125 --> 02:36:04.345]  No.
[02:36:05.005 --> 02:36:05.226]  No.
[02:36:06.346 --> 02:36:11.807]  Yeah, just the fact that the entire event is so shrouded in secrecy.
[02:36:11.847 --> 02:36:16.627]  They ordered the FAA to destroy the tapes, as well, the tapes they recorded at the towers.
[02:36:18.208 --> 02:36:18.628]  Yeah.
[02:36:21.073 --> 02:36:21.333]  I know.
[02:36:22.874 --> 02:36:27.736]  Again, I'm not coming on your show to say I know who did it, I know how they did it, and I know why they did it.
[02:36:28.156 --> 02:36:37.660]  I'm just coming on to talk about what we've been told as a public, and again, a lot of it is pretty
[02:36:41.061 --> 02:36:42.722]  Silly, for lack of a better term.
[02:36:43.502 --> 02:36:45.203]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[02:36:45.243 --> 02:36:47.044]  We know there hasn't been a real investigation.
[02:36:47.084 --> 02:36:48.304]  In fact, there's been a cover-up.
[02:36:48.784 --> 02:36:51.586]  And when you normally see a cover-up going on, that's pretty suspicious.
[02:36:52.706 --> 02:36:53.407]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36:53.427 --> 02:36:56.148]  Let me ask you this, though.
[02:36:56.988 --> 02:37:06.532]  Everybody's now familiar with the famous Andrew Card Bush ear-whisperer at the elementary school.
[02:37:08.783 --> 02:37:16.909]  That whole incident is problematic to me because, as we talked about yesterday, it was broadcast three days in advance of his schedule, correct?
[02:37:16.929 --> 02:37:17.690]  The President's schedule?
[02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:18.150]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:18.750 --> 02:37:18.970]  Yes.
[02:37:19.111 --> 02:37:24.614]  So, conservatively, if that event was being broadcast live, right?
[02:37:25.115 --> 02:37:25.315]  Yes.
[02:37:26.396 --> 02:37:31.279]  How many people in the state of Florida knew where the President was at that specific point in time?
[02:37:33.112 --> 02:37:36.956]  Basically, the entire population that watched the TV news, it was a big event.
[02:37:37.437 --> 02:37:46.306]  Okay, alright, so... If, in fact, he was being informed that the second plane had hit, America's under attack, right?
[02:37:46.706 --> 02:37:47.307]  Isn't he then...
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:52.961]  Putting everybody in his immediate circle at great risk?
[02:37:53.261 --> 02:37:55.502]  Including that school full of elementary students?
[02:37:55.962 --> 02:37:56.963]  That's what I'm talking about, yeah.
[02:37:57.423 --> 02:38:06.686]  Yeah, so it would seem to me that upon the revelation of that news that the Secret Service would grab the President and remove him
[02:38:08.073 --> 02:38:10.714]  As if he were on fire from that room.
[02:38:10.954 --> 02:38:15.415]  Well, you're right, and he was only about ten minutes away from a major airport.
[02:38:15.455 --> 02:38:31.278]  I mean, and they were saying they thought there were hijackers all over the country, and everyone's in incredible fear, but oh, George Bush, he just sits there after he's told the second plane has hit for around twenty minutes, and then kind of just ambles out, taking his time.
[02:38:31.798 --> 02:38:36.744]  Of course, some Secret Service did say, let's get him out, and then Cardin and others just said, no, we're going to stay.
[02:38:36.784 --> 02:38:37.645]  I wonder what they knew.
[02:38:37.665 --> 02:38:45.094]  You know, it's funny, Jeb Bush declared martial law three days before, too, and that was kind of kept just a little bit quiet as well.
[02:38:45.594 --> 02:38:46.856]  Did Jeb Bush ever explain why?
[02:38:47.476 --> 02:38:50.197]  No, he wouldn't say why, and Bush wouldn't say why.
[02:38:50.217 --> 02:38:53.239]  They had massed 44,000 U.S.
[02:38:53.619 --> 02:39:05.964]  troops, 18,000 British troops into Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and had carrier attack groups about to launch their attacks on Afghanistan, and he had that order signed on his desk just waiting two days before 9-11.
[02:39:06.265 --> 02:39:13.708]  That was incredibly convenient to have your whole military stacked up and ready to go into Afghanistan, something that took about six months to build up, I'm told.
[02:39:14.822 --> 02:39:17.923]  Yeah, because you don't really put those strategies together overnight, do you?
[02:39:17.943 --> 02:39:21.824]  For a major invasion, no.
[02:39:22.504 --> 02:39:25.205]  No, those are really well calculated and really well planned.
[02:39:26.125 --> 02:39:27.125]  At least from this government.
[02:39:28.766 --> 02:39:29.406]  Well, you're right.
[02:39:31.346 --> 02:39:32.387]  But let me ask you this.
[02:39:33.947 --> 02:39:41.689]  In a statement that the President made following, I think it was a school kid that asked him, what did you think when the first plane hit?
[02:39:43.061 --> 02:39:48.984]  And he said something to the effect of, I was watching it on TV like everybody else, and I thought, oh gosh, that's pilot error.
[02:39:49.224 --> 02:39:49.564]  Correct?
[02:39:49.864 --> 02:39:50.164]  Yes.
[02:39:50.785 --> 02:39:55.707]  So, I guess one of the perks of being president is you get access to TV channels
[02:39:56.731 --> 02:39:58.792]  Don't exist in the known universe, correct?
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:25.689]  He wasn't even aware the first building had been hit when he went out to give the speech, but then the Times of London and AP had photos of him watching the first tower smoking after it had been announced there in the green room.
[02:40:25.709 --> 02:40:27.230]  So we also have a lot of lying going on.
[02:40:28.411 --> 02:40:40.960]  Yeah, it might lead to believe that he'd seen similar images in some type of a rehearsal
[02:40:43.254 --> 02:40:43.715]  As it were.
[02:40:43.735 --> 02:40:45.436]  Yes.
[02:40:46.096 --> 02:40:54.902]  What did you think of the guns being taken from the pilots just a few months before in July, the federal law being changed by Bush so pilots couldn't carry firearms?
[02:40:55.943 --> 02:40:57.024]  That's a little convenient, isn't it?
[02:40:58.785 --> 02:41:04.269]  Because that was instituted post-Cuban Missile Crisis, correct?
[02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.749]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:06.991]  Yeah, so that had been in place for almost 40 years.
[02:41:09.602 --> 02:41:16.797]  It's, you know, it's right in there with, I guess it was June or July of 2001, when after 46 years, Cheney changed
[02:41:20.595 --> 02:41:22.356]  The authorization for the shoot-down orders.
[02:41:22.896 --> 02:41:23.516]  Oh, that's right.
[02:41:23.936 --> 02:41:30.639]  Since NORAD was set up in the late fifties, generals and admirals had standing shoot-down orders of errant aircraft like Payne Stewart.
[02:41:30.659 --> 02:41:32.600]  They were ready in that case a few years before.
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:40.443]  But magically, he took the power away from all the generals and only gave it to himself and to his adjunct, the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:41:40.984 --> 02:41:42.324]  Yeah.
[02:41:42.424 --> 02:41:46.506]  No, again, you know, I'm not on your show to say
[02:41:47.358 --> 02:41:48.439]  Who did it, or why?
[02:41:48.459 --> 02:41:49.799]  Because I don't have those answers.
[02:41:50.259 --> 02:41:53.861]  Yeah, we just shouldn't have an investigation by their very people that turns out to be a whitewash.
[02:41:53.901 --> 02:42:02.425]  I mean, the 9-11 Commission, we talked yesterday about how the Commission claimed there weren't even support pillars in the middle of Tower 1 and 2 when it had the biggest columns in the world up until that time.
[02:42:03.294 --> 02:42:04.175]  Yeah, it had how many?
[02:42:04.195 --> 02:42:04.175]  47.
[02:42:04.215 --> 02:42:06.977]  47, that's right, yeah.
[02:42:07.397 --> 02:42:23.229]  And it would seem to me, just based on what we've all seen, those images that are indelibly blazing into our memories forever, again, I don't have experience in avionics or high-rise mechanics.
[02:42:26.912 --> 02:42:34.140]  But it looked like the majority of the jet fuel, upon impact, exploded.
[02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:34.881]  Yes, it did.
[02:42:37.671 --> 02:42:51.557]  I have a hard time believing that a fireball traveled down the elevator over 1100 feet and still had the explosive energy to destroy the lobby like it was described.
[02:42:51.957 --> 02:42:59.320]  Well we can fill a two hour film just with quick cuts of different firefighters and police saying they saw bombs going off
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:08.310]  But then they were told to shut up, and then they did these after-action video reports with the firemen and police, and then the government declared national security on those tapes.
[02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:10.272]  Then they declared that they were destroyed.
[02:43:10.592 --> 02:43:12.895]  Then with a congressional order, some got released.
[02:43:13.235 --> 02:43:15.217]  And what are the firemen and police saying on the tapes?
[02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:18.301]  That they saw bombs going off in all three of the buildings.
[02:43:19.102 --> 02:43:25.705]  Yeah, and this one guy in that famous clip talks about it looked like one of those, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, controlled detonations.
[02:43:25.765 --> 02:43:26.705]  In fact, we have that clip.
[02:43:26.745 --> 02:43:28.386]  Now, there's two in the computer, John, so be careful.
[02:43:28.486 --> 02:43:30.207]  One hasn't been edited, and that's the cussing.
[02:43:30.467 --> 02:43:31.107]  Don't air that one.
[02:43:31.127 --> 02:43:31.507]  Be careful.
[02:43:31.527 --> 02:43:32.288]  Be sure to blast on.
[02:43:32.308 --> 02:43:33.488]  We almost had a mistake.
[02:43:33.508 --> 02:43:37.770]  Can you find the one where the firefighters are saying, it looked as if they had detonators?
[02:43:37.810 --> 02:43:38.810]  Are you talking about that one?
[02:43:39.270 --> 02:43:40.511]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
[02:43:40.911 --> 02:43:48.633]  And then now there are films that have come out, and of course I have all these clips, but there are films that just have an hour and a half of just that, Charlie.
[02:43:49.494 --> 02:43:50.894]  Just different firemen saying that.
[02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:59.276]  Sure, and again, this is not you and I watching the video, you know, speculating about what we think we saw.
[02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:04.558]  These are gentlemen, you know, inside the buildings,
[02:44:05.716 --> 02:44:09.217]  Uh, at the very point of, um, of collapse.
[02:44:09.237 --> 02:44:10.477]  Let's go ahead and roll that next clip.
[02:44:10.497 --> 02:44:10.818]  Here it is.
[02:44:11.178 --> 02:44:11.378]  Sure.
[02:44:30.783 --> 02:44:31.124]  I'll run it.
[02:44:31.144 --> 02:44:31.365]  I'll run it.
[02:44:31.385 --> 02:44:34.733]  I jump behind a battalion car, I hit under the car, I swing and die.
[02:44:42.108 --> 02:44:43.929]  Mr. Sheen, what do you think we should do then?
[02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:45.730]  I mean, this is a citizen, you have that right.
[02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:47.011]  What do you think we should do?
[02:44:47.031 --> 02:44:49.812]  I mean, what type of... What would be a real investigation?
[02:44:49.832 --> 02:45:04.280]  What would satisfy you who, according to most Americans in major polls, a CNN poll 90%, a Zombie poll 49%, take whatever poll you want, but more than half of Americans in major polls want some type of real investigation.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.100]  What would you like to see?
[02:45:06.001 --> 02:45:07.141]  I would like to see the same thing.
[02:45:07.181 --> 02:45:08.042]  I think it's got to be
[02:45:10.402 --> 02:45:17.766]  It's got to be headed by, if this is possible, some neutral investigative committee.
[02:45:20.488 --> 02:45:21.028]  I don't know...
[02:45:22.054 --> 02:45:24.435]  Exactly how to establish that.
[02:45:24.795 --> 02:45:27.455]  Well, the problem is... You would know more about that than I would.
[02:45:27.635 --> 02:45:31.676]  Well, the problem is they tried to, again, appoint Henry Kissinger and they called him independent.
[02:45:32.136 --> 02:45:36.857]  It was like appointing one of Janet Reno's deputies to investigate Waco and calling it independent.
[02:45:37.297 --> 02:45:38.458]  What would be independent?
[02:45:39.018 --> 02:45:47.280]  Maybe just randomly pick 20 engineers or something and then draft them for a committee and then make sure no one tried to intimidate the witnesses.
[02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:49.200]  I mean, maybe just a jury of the peers.
[02:45:50.299 --> 02:45:55.107]  What if we use retired political foreign nationals?
[02:45:55.588 --> 02:45:58.693]  What if we use experts that don't have any ties whatsoever?
[02:45:59.304 --> 02:46:00.204]  To this administration?
[02:46:00.725 --> 02:46:06.007]  Well, Michael Meacher, number three in the Blair government, says that he believes the government may be behind it.
[02:46:06.387 --> 02:46:10.949]  And then we have Andres von Bülow, the former German defense minister, saying the same thing.
[02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:15.510]  And a bunch of other Russian and other foreign leaders are saying the same thing.
[02:46:15.810 --> 02:46:19.432]  Over 80% of the French public in major polls say our government did it.
[02:46:19.732 --> 02:46:22.953]  So, boy, if we got foreigners to do it, I think they come to the same conclusion we have.
[02:46:23.594 --> 02:46:24.074]  Right, right, right.
[02:46:24.094 --> 02:46:27.315]  But I'm just saying, as far as people that don't have a stake, or don't have an interest, or don't
[02:46:28.340 --> 02:46:30.021]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:46:30.141 --> 02:46:30.602]  I agree with you.
[02:46:30.622 --> 02:46:32.603]  I'm just saying that they would come to the same conclusion.
[02:46:34.444 --> 02:46:38.326]  Well, I guess in the court of public opinion, I would say that people aren't buying the official story.
[02:46:39.647 --> 02:46:40.207]  No, they're not.
[02:46:40.628 --> 02:46:41.108]  They're not.
[02:46:41.188 --> 02:46:43.469]  And I would place myself in that court.
[02:46:45.090 --> 02:46:47.672]  But, you know, so we've talked about Building 7, right?
[02:46:49.133 --> 02:46:52.615]  And that whole episode really smells a rat.
[02:46:54.056 --> 02:46:57.218]  But then you've got to sort of shift the focus to the Pentagon.
[02:46:58.889 --> 02:46:59.749]  Very suspicious.
[02:47:00.209 --> 02:47:01.830]  You know, are we coming up on a break?
[02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:03.570]  Should we come back to the Pentagon after the break?
[02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:07.931]  Yeah, let's do that after the break, but in the minute and a half or so we've got right now.
[02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:08.571]  Okay.
[02:47:08.591 --> 02:47:11.212]  What about PNAC, Project for an American Century?
[02:47:11.652 --> 02:47:21.514]  Dick Cheney pins a piece in September 2000 titled, Rebuilding America's Defenses, and he says we need a Pearl Harbor event to catalyze the American people
[02:47:21.994 --> 02:47:23.755]  To invade the Middle East.
[02:47:23.976 --> 02:47:26.277]  We need to have a terror attack on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[02:47:26.458 --> 02:47:28.319]  And then Brzezinski goes further.
[02:47:28.359 --> 02:47:30.641]  He says we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event.
[02:47:32.582 --> 02:47:33.443]  Yeah.
[02:47:34.043 --> 02:47:34.684]  Coincidence?
[02:47:35.124 --> 02:47:36.045]  We think not.
[02:47:38.126 --> 02:47:45.192]  No, I think again it's emblematic of the arrogance of this administration.
[02:47:46.773 --> 02:47:49.075]  Even just that video that was released
[02:47:50.367 --> 02:47:58.172]  Last week, I believe, the interview prior to Katrina, and I mean, it's not like there's, you know, again, supposition.
[02:47:58.352 --> 02:48:01.373]  It's documented quotes on videotape.
[02:48:02.354 --> 02:48:09.498]  And the White House comes out and says, well, you can't really look to that as any, you know, clear-cut example of what we knew.
[02:48:09.698 --> 02:48:11.859]  Yeah, FEMA said it's going to probably destroy the city.
[02:48:11.899 --> 02:48:13.400]  The Houston Chronicle reported that.
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:15.101]  Times-Picayune reported it.
[02:48:15.121 --> 02:48:15.761]  Everybody knew.
[02:48:15.781 --> 02:48:17.482]  And then Bush goes off on vacation.
[02:48:18.633 --> 02:48:18.873]  Yeah.
[02:48:19.274 --> 02:48:22.556]  No, again, it is a very arrogant administration.
[02:48:22.596 --> 02:48:24.277]  Well, what about them today?
[02:48:24.998 --> 02:48:28.620]  Mr. Sheen's saying that Iraq's better off and everything's going great.
[02:48:30.261 --> 02:48:31.042]  Yeah.
[02:48:31.522 --> 02:48:35.565]  I don't know that they're talking about the same Iraq that you and I are observing.
[02:48:35.865 --> 02:48:36.446]  I agree with you.
[02:48:36.466 --> 02:48:37.206]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:37.466 --> 02:48:38.327]  Amazing interview.
[02:48:38.387 --> 02:48:40.048]  The conclusion on the other side.
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:53.747]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.028 --> 02:48:58.772]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:58.992 --> 02:49:04.638]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.878 --> 02:49:16.783]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:16.803 --> 02:49:21.325]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.485 --> 02:49:24.006]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.226 --> 02:49:30.929]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:49:36.457 --> 02:49:36.878]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.738 --> 02:49:49.619]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:49.839 --> 02:49:55.281]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:55.561 --> 02:50:05.925]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:06.085 --> 02:50:10.426]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:10.546 --> 02:50:11.427]  We're good to go!
[02:50:31.363 --> 02:50:31.784]  I think so.
[02:50:47.153 --> 02:50:47.614]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.512 --> 02:51:03.112]  I think so.

[02:51:44.457 --> 02:51:53.226]  Well, I talked to him during the break, and he has really been a champ, spending a whole hour of his precious time with us.
[02:51:53.266 --> 02:52:00.054]  He's gonna leave us in just about four minutes, five minutes, and go work on his TV show today.
[02:52:00.074 --> 02:52:02.817]  Two and a half minutes, it'll be on tonight, 8 o'clock, CBS.
[02:52:03.968 --> 02:52:10.209]  But I was talking to him yesterday and he talked about some of the folks there where he works and a story that one of the crew told him.
[02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:12.910]  And it meshes with this article out of Knight Ridder today.
[02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:18.391]  Pentagon hired contractors to advise on collecting information on churches, mosques and other U.S.
[02:52:18.451 --> 02:52:20.032]  sites spying on American citizens.
[02:52:20.052 --> 02:52:20.652]  Here's another one.
[02:52:21.012 --> 02:52:24.093]  Washington Post, advance workers for Bush impersonated reporters.
[02:52:24.433 --> 02:52:29.054]  They're all over the place posing as reporters spying on people and advance teams doing that.
[02:52:29.774 --> 02:52:32.175]  And they just do this all over the place.
[02:52:33.436 --> 02:52:34.836]  Charlie, your take on that?
[02:52:35.817 --> 02:52:55.885]  Well, yeah, there's a young guy, this young kid at work, he's from Nigeria, and he's in the production department, and he sort of overheard a conversation, I was talking about the events of 9-11 and this and that, and he said, you know, it was interesting, because at the time, he was attending George Washington University in downtown D.C.
[02:52:57.023 --> 02:53:13.377]  And he said the day after the event that federal teams of what they were described as trauma counselors came to his school, came to his college, came into the classrooms and basically told them, you're all in shock.
[02:53:14.158 --> 02:53:18.121]  What we've seen is unlike anything we've ever witnessed.
[02:53:18.581 --> 02:53:19.262]  We understand
[02:53:19.927 --> 02:53:26.454]  That in moments like this, that your memory, your eyes, will play tricks on you in the future.
[02:53:26.974 --> 02:53:28.576]  So, if anybody's questioning...
[02:53:30.339 --> 02:53:33.562]  You know, what we're telling you has happened.
[02:53:34.723 --> 02:53:38.366]  Do not believe what you think you know about yesterday.
[02:53:38.666 --> 02:53:44.432]  Basically telling them that here's the story, follow it, have a good day.
[02:53:44.452 --> 02:53:47.254]  I have questions about the Pentagon, so do you.
[02:53:47.314 --> 02:53:51.098]  Why did they grab hundreds of surveillance camera tapes and declare national security?
[02:53:51.138 --> 02:53:53.680]  Why won't they just show us the footage of what happened?
[02:53:54.799 --> 02:53:57.180]  Show us this incredible maneuvering.
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:58.741]  Just show it to us.
[02:53:59.441 --> 02:54:04.103]  Just show us, you know, how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers.
[02:54:04.243 --> 02:54:05.063]  What was it?
[02:54:05.243 --> 02:54:06.944]  A 270 degree turn at 500 miles an hour?
[02:54:07.324 --> 02:54:09.425]  Descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes?
[02:54:10.125 --> 02:54:14.727]  Skimming across the treetops the last 500 meters?
[02:54:14.987 --> 02:54:16.568]  You can't hold... Four feet off the ground?
[02:54:16.588 --> 02:54:24.391]  I have talked to pilots who've flown that very aircraft, that very type, and they say that at 500 and something miles an hour, you cannot fly that low to the ground.
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:26.720]  Yeah, no.
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:34.982]  If that happened, and there are that many cameras on it, you know, I understand in the interest of national security that maybe not release the Pentagon cameras, but what about the Sheraton?
[02:54:35.302 --> 02:54:36.362]  What about the gas station?
[02:54:36.782 --> 02:54:39.163]  What about the Department of Transportation freeway cam?
[02:54:39.503 --> 02:54:42.624]  What about all these shots that had this thing perfectly documented?
[02:54:43.504 --> 02:54:48.785]  Instead, they put out five frames that they claim not to have authorized, correct?
[02:54:49.947 --> 02:54:51.629]  And it doesn't look like a passenger liner.
[02:54:51.649 --> 02:54:54.252]  It looks like some type of small white aircraft or drone.
[02:54:55.513 --> 02:54:56.695]  It's really suspicious.
[02:54:56.875 --> 02:55:04.243]  And then, if you look in the lower left-hand corner at the date stamp, it's September 12th.
[02:55:07.852 --> 02:55:10.875]  It's just, uh... As usual, nothing they say fits.
[02:55:10.995 --> 02:55:12.316]  Nothing at any point.
[02:55:12.456 --> 02:55:14.458]  Everything they say turns out to be a fraud.
[02:55:15.418 --> 02:55:18.461]  Yeah, but just the whole thing about, well, the plane disintegrated and this and that.
[02:55:18.481 --> 02:55:26.867]  Now, I don't know what a Boeing, uh, you know, what that jet is going to do into a, you know, reinforced limestone facade.
[02:55:26.927 --> 02:55:29.269]  But it did disappear like the Wicked Witch from Waterheader.
[02:55:29.329 --> 02:55:31.231]  It just, it just all went into a 14-foot hole.
[02:55:32.131 --> 02:55:32.711]  Exactly.
[02:55:33.251 --> 02:55:44.455]  But this whole thing about, even if you just take the one statement about the wings folding up, it seems like at that impact velocity, everything is still going the same speed.
[02:55:44.635 --> 02:55:45.575]  You know what?
[02:55:46.075 --> 02:55:55.398]  Mr. Sheen, Charlie Sheen, we've got to get you back up in the near future, and of course you and I are going to be working on something in the near future, and I'm really honored to be collaborating with you, and I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:55:55.858 --> 02:55:57.499]  Closing comments in the last 30 seconds.
[02:55:58.359 --> 02:56:00.360]  Last 30 seconds, it is up to us.
[02:56:01.087 --> 02:56:02.768]  To reveal the truth.
[02:56:02.808 --> 02:56:05.650]  It is up to us, because we owe it to the families.
[02:56:05.690 --> 02:56:06.851]  We owe it to the victims.
[02:56:06.891 --> 02:56:11.614]  We owe it to everybody whose life was drastically altered.
[02:56:12.054 --> 02:56:12.795]  Horrifically.
[02:56:13.775 --> 02:56:15.857]  That day and forever.
[02:56:16.037 --> 02:56:17.018]  We owe it to them.
[02:56:17.218 --> 02:56:17.558]  We do.
[02:56:17.678 --> 02:56:19.339]  To uncover what happened.
[02:56:19.459 --> 02:56:19.899]  Yes sir.
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:20.600]  Godspeed.
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:21.320]  You've got a lot of courage.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:22.021]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:56:24.525 --> 02:56:29.416]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
