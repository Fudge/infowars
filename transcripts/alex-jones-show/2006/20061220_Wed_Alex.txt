[00:00:05.857 --> 00:00:06.498]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:08.199]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.041]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.502]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:14.185]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:17.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:22.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:54.944]  Coming up in the second hour we're going to be joined by John Connor who's doing a greater and greater job on a routine basis getting out there exposing 9-11.
[00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:57.806]  He walks into big university halls and began
[00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:04.074]  Yelling and screaming and getting the information out about September 11th.
[00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:16.417]  He of course also calls into national talk shows on a repeated basis focusing listeners in on Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones and 9-11.
[00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:26.080]  And he walked up to one of these petty celebrities on the streets of Los Angeles
[00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:51.933]  Just a week or so ago and brought up 9-11 to this Bonaducci character and the guy just told him he was an idiot and that nobody was watching and that he was a nobody and that we're all a bunch of kooks and so the video got posted on the web and then I guess Bonaducci decided to try to hype it somehow and turn it into some type of publicity stunt
[00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:54.905]  We got John Connor coming on.
[00:01:54.945 --> 00:02:05.731]  I just thought, though, Connor's in contact with this Bonaduce character, who's constantly on every neocon radio and TV show known to man, calling for total world government and a police state.
[00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:13.555]  What we ought to do is try to get Mr. Bonaduce on the show.
[00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:21.239]  He's just some child actor from the 70s, but now better known for worshipping George W. Bush.
[00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.667]  But it's just an illustration of how these individuals hype things.
[00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:37.661]  He then claimed that he was getting death threats on his MySpace, and that he didn't contact the FBI, they contacted him, and he told the FBI, oh no, I don't want to prosecute anybody.
[00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:43.736]  Well, you know, when we get a death threat, we do call the FBI and we do file a complaint.
[00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:50.259]  And this whole thing sounds staged to me, or this individual would be doing something about this.
[00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.962]  So we'll play the clip of the video, play the audio from the video coming up later.
[00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:05.027]  And we also have Tommy Pallotta to talk about Scanner Darkly and its dystopic view of the nightmare near future.
[00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:11.712]  Coming up, joining us for about 30 minutes at the last half hour of the third hour today.
[00:03:11.732 --> 00:03:18.135]  We'll also have open phones on this Wednesday edition.
[00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:23.358]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:46.667]  Also, back on Monday, we had an individual on who's made it into the national press reporting on a story picked up by Hustler Magazine, of all places, with video of what appears to be Timothy McVeigh, a year and a half after he's in the U.S.
[00:03:46.908 --> 00:03:53.412]  Army, in an Army uniform at a military base in the Dakotas.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.459]  And a lot of people compared the photo to McVeigh five, ten years later, pale, with more meat on his bones.
[00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.352]  Well, and didn't think it was him.
[00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:14.818]  Well, we went and got actual photos of McVeigh, admitted photos of McVeigh when he was in the military, and I'm telling you, same ears, same eyes, same face.
[00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:23.384]  A voice analysis has been done by a prestigious professor who's an expert in voice identification.
[00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:29.809]  He said it is a high match and would testify in court that he believes it is Timothy McVeigh.
[00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.290]  And we have all those reports.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:51.386]  Posted, but I challenge you to go up to Infowars.com Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com Look at the story, look at those photos, the new photos we've added of McVeigh in 91 versus this video allegedly shot in 93 and call us and tell us who you think it is.
[00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:55.287]  Alright, there's a ton of other news, you'll want to stay with us.
[00:04:56.107 --> 00:04:59.228]  North American Union news, you name it, we'll be right back.
[00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:07.674]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:09.955]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.316 --> 00:05:18.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.725]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:32.989]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.484 --> 00:05:37.525]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:41.366]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.727]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:47.988]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:06.619]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:14.866]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:22.172]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:23.272]  We're good to go!

[00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:03.269]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.710]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.292]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:17.354]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:29.979]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:34.321]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:40.823]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer!
[00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:47.266]  Honest, Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:52.028]  That's Wristease.
[00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:57.150]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.791]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:08.594]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.194 --> 00:08:12.235]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:23.218]  There is a gigantic article.
[00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:27.160]  I mean, this thing is like 20 pages long.
[00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:43.189]  In Mother Jones Magazine that just came out, it's the February 2007 issue, and it gets into the national toll roads that are going in.
[00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.675]  It's titled, The Highwaymen, i.e., The Highway Robbers.
[00:08:49.244 --> 00:08:57.606]  Why you could soon be paying Wall Street investors, Australian bankers, and Spanish builders for the privilege of driving on American roads.
[00:08:57.766 --> 00:09:05.308]  And it goes through the history of our roads, the interstate under Eisenhower, and with just amazing precision.
[00:09:06.328 --> 00:09:08.149]  Because I've read the article now.
[00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:10.549]  With amazing precision.
[00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:13.170]  We're posting it up on JonesReport.com right now.
[00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:31.333]  It goes through that they have paid off the politicians and they're basically being given the roads and then they promise later to pay a percentage of it as tax revenue to county, state, federal, and yes, international.
[00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:38.077]  And the reason I bring this up out of the gates as I did yesterday, I was on
[00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:53.322]  Well, it seems every day I'm amazed by ignorance and willful ignorance on the Trans-Texas Corridors, the NAFTA Highways, the funding mechanism, the surveillance mechanism, the control mechanism of the New World Order.
[00:09:53.382 --> 00:09:55.283]  Roads are commerce, are power.
[00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:59.947]  The U.S., more than any other nation in the world, is designed and based on roads.
[00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:01.648]  We live far apart.
[00:10:01.808 --> 00:10:03.229]  Our cities are sprawling.
[00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.612]  They're not thousands of years old and compact like Europe.
[00:10:07.933 --> 00:10:09.274]  Trains couldn't ever
[00:10:10.072 --> 00:10:10.433]  I don't
[00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:29.579]  By hook or by crook, there is no level of taxation which we won't pay to use those.
[00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.259]  We have a love affair with the road.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.901]  Almost everybody in this country has a car.
[00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:41.344]  You basically have to have a car to get to work or you better get up an hour or two earlier than you would just to get there by bus.
[00:10:43.144 --> 00:10:48.927]  Unless you live in a few cities like New York and still it's a nightmare on the buses and the trains and the cabs.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:11:00.802]  They know what they're doing and they are seizing the roads and this is how they're going to finance and govern and track and surveil our nation.
[00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:02.182]  This is the octopus.
[00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:03.983]  This is the grid.
[00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:05.083]  This is the net.
[00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.183]  The roads literally are a net to be used.
[00:11:08.203 --> 00:11:12.544]  They're going to wall off many areas into UN biosphere zones.
[00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:17.605]  That's all been officially agreed to and signed on to under the guise of saving the environment.
[00:11:19.686 --> 00:11:20.506]  It's all happening.
[00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:31.569]  And I talked about how I was down at the TV station on Monday, and there was the Republican Party Chairman of Travis County, Austin, Texas, and he was just denying that there's even a North American Union.
[00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.172]  First, people deny there's a North American Union.
[00:11:36.192 --> 00:11:39.234]  I guess he's still in that phase of denying it, denying it, denying it.
[00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:44.118]  Now it's here, and other people are just spinning it and saying it's a good thing.
[00:11:49.449 --> 00:12:09.062]  And sure enough, I was on Lars Larson's big national radio show last night, and I brought up the fact that American University professor Robert Pastor, who is the co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:22.270]  Who literally wrote the agreement that Bush signed last March and expanded last December with then Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada and then President Vicente Fox of Mexico.
[00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.872]  Bush is the last of the three amigos.
[00:12:24.353 --> 00:12:32.342]  Literally, word for word, the agreement borrowed much of the towards a North American
[00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:36.079]  Union Towards a North American Community.
[00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:37.600]  There's two separate documents.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:46.544]  They borrowed whole paragraphs and wrote it into this executive fiat administrative merger of our countries.
[00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:52.107]  And so, lo and behold, I'm on Lars Larson last night and what does he bring up?
[00:12:52.947 --> 00:13:00.791]  He starts basically saying the North American Union's good because it's going to give us security.
[00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:02.732]  And he says, well, what's wrong with roads?
[00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.891]  What's wrong with security?
[00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:17.077]  I mean, soon will the, quote, officials and authorities in your area, not the public servants, but the authorities, the officials, will they show up and just say, we need to take your house?
[00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:18.798]  It's for security?
[00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:19.878]  That's what the British would say.
[00:13:21.299 --> 00:13:24.581]  One of the reasons that we saw the kickoff of the Revolutionary War
[00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:28.982]  I mean, everything is for security.
[00:13:29.002 --> 00:13:41.831]  We're going to get rid of our borders, we're going to hand our roads over to foreign corporations, we're going to track everything you do, we're going to tax the living daylights out of you, and if you're not for it, you're with Al Qaeda, basically.
[00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:52.578]  Imagine doing an hour-long interview with a guy on over 200 radio stations, and I've been on there before, and
[00:13:57.777 --> 00:13:59.657]  He was apologizing.
[00:14:01.558 --> 00:14:08.479]  He was openly defending the North American Union.
[00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:13.560]  Now, this is one of those supposed stalwart conservatives.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:19.181]  Now, normally you can't get a neocon talk show host to even talk about the North American Union.
[00:14:19.201 --> 00:14:23.842]  According to Limbaugh, it is still a kook detector.
[00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:27.015]  Doesn't matter if it's been in hundreds of newspapers.
[00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:28.576]  Doesn't matter if it's admitted.
[00:14:28.996 --> 00:14:31.999]  Doesn't matter if congressmen have gone public speaking out against it.
[00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:35.742]  It doesn't matter if Lou Dobbs has talked about it probably 20-30 times on a show.
[00:14:36.282 --> 00:14:39.225]  It doesn't matter if it's official and you can read the agreement.
[00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:40.846]  It doesn't matter.
[00:14:40.986 --> 00:14:42.067]  It's a kook detector.
[00:14:42.087 --> 00:14:43.288]  There isn't a CFR.
[00:14:43.808 --> 00:14:44.689]  Yeah, we know Limbaugh.
[00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:47.091]  Your books are published by a CFR imprint.
[00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:50.454]  There isn't a CFR.
[00:14:52.051 --> 00:14:53.612]  There's no Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:14:53.632 --> 00:14:55.334]  There's no plan for a One World Government.
[00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.155]  There's no plan for a North American Union.
[00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:04.882]  And so, see, some of them are still on that old script, but then others, like Lars Larson,
[00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:16.330]  have now gotten up to a more modern script and they say, oh yeah, what's wrong with us coordinating our security with Mexico and Canada?
[00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.372]  What's wrong with us letting some foreign corporations run our roads?
[00:15:19.692 --> 00:15:21.152]  Oh Alex, you're not free market!
[00:15:21.492 --> 00:15:22.673]  And I'd say, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:24.053]  We have the TxDOT documents.
[00:15:24.093 --> 00:15:25.794]  We have even documents out of Oregon.
[00:15:26.274 --> 00:15:32.977]  We have documents where they're basically being, and it's all in Mother Jones this month, being given to them.
[00:15:34.204 --> 00:15:36.224]  We've interviewed Joseph Stiklitz, Nobel Prize winner.
[00:15:36.264 --> 00:15:47.126]  He said in the final phases of a country going into receivership, the big central banks come in and basically instruct the politicians to start handing off the infrastructure.
[00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:48.547]  The same thing happened in China.
[00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:50.407]  They sent Smudley Butler in there.
[00:15:50.447 --> 00:15:51.767]  They sent him into Guatemala.
[00:15:52.107 --> 00:15:55.788]  The Marine Corps General, later he wrote about it, how they were there overthrowing countries.
[00:15:56.688 --> 00:15:58.028]  But now they don't do it militarily.
[00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:00.109]  They do it with payoffs.
[00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:01.709]  It's like the big telecom companies.
[00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:09.868]  What, just six of them together spent $150 million this year trying to end net neutrality, to start shutting down freedom on the web?
[00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:22.481]  And only because the committee chairman sounded like a complete lunatic on air, not knowing what the internet even was, and calling it a bunch of tubes, and saying they had to save the fouled up tubes, that did it fail?
[00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:23.762]  But they'll be back next session!
[00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:27.697]  You think $150 million is a lot?
[00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:37.261]  They've spent a lot more lobbying at every county and every city and every state at the federal level, billions of dollars, and now they're just handing over.
[00:16:37.321 --> 00:16:40.883]  And Mother Jones goes through how they're doing this, and they call it privatization.
[00:16:40.923 --> 00:16:43.344]  Here's Lars Larson calling it privatization.
[00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:45.025]  What's wrong with free market, Alex?
[00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:47.866]  It's not free market.
[00:16:47.986 --> 00:16:51.868]  It is global corporations becoming our government.
[00:16:53.118 --> 00:16:54.479]  Having governmental power.
[00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:59.441]  It's taking over existing roads we've paid for two and three times over.
[00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:01.042]  Take Texas.
[00:17:01.922 --> 00:17:07.044]  Six billion dollars in a bank account they haven't even touched.
[00:17:08.225 --> 00:17:12.687]  Untold amounts of money in their comprehensive annual financial report slush funds.
[00:17:13.307 --> 00:17:19.950]  And they're busy saying, we're broke, we're broke, we have to, we have to sell the roads to Sintra of Spain.
[00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:35.981]  And then you read the agreement which the legislature had to sue over and start criminal complaints over because they said, oh, TxDOT, Texas Department of Transportation, and their agreement with a foreign company is secret and confidential.
[00:17:37.442 --> 00:17:40.083]  Finally got much of it and they're not paying anything.
[00:17:40.263 --> 00:17:41.524]  They're putting no money down.
[00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:52.237]  Once they start operating the toll roads, then they will pay a percentage into the state to quote, upkeep the roads.
[00:17:52.498 --> 00:17:58.082]  And if they lay any new blacktop on an existing highway, it then becomes their road.
[00:17:58.582 --> 00:17:59.943]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:03.626]  This is absolutely amazing!
[00:18:05.612 --> 00:18:17.554]  It's states, and they've done this, the same company in Florida and other areas where they run these out, they've done it in Mexico, we've covered it, read the news articles here and there, had expert guests on, the head of Corridor Watch, Stahl and others, David Stahl.
[00:18:19.355 --> 00:18:33.077]  If they're toll roads, which are existing roads they're seizing, or they'll re-blacktop a bridge, and then just put a toll on that bridge, and then say they own that bridge, and then okay, well you've just got to pay on an existing highway to go over the bridge now.
[00:18:33.729 --> 00:18:37.711]  This is how they get around the law against tolling existing roads.
[00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:43.474]  I don't know, there's just so many frauds and so many scams they're running.
[00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:45.655]  Many of you are already aware of this.
[00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:51.519]  But just to go on a show, and he kept going, oh, very nice conspiracy, Mr. Jones.
[00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:54.420]  Very nice, oh, the conspiracy theory.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.464]  And then he would just admit the North American Union was here, but still, I'm a conspiracy theorist because I don't like it.
[00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:15.566]  But if the existing roads they seize and put toll roads on, quote, don't make them enough money, and that's all agreed upon in the agreement with the state.
[00:19:17.647 --> 00:19:21.569]  With a state agency that says it's outside the legislature and outside the people.
[00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:22.329]  I forgot that part.
[00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:31.453]  That then they can shut down existing lanes and roads, arterials that are being used to circumvent the toll road.
[00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:32.974]  It's in the agreement.
[00:19:35.825 --> 00:19:39.607]  And I'm on a talk show being laughed at because I'm against it.
[00:19:41.428 --> 00:19:45.770]  And there indeed there are phony conservatives out there sucking their thumbs loving it.
[00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.851]  I'm the liberal, see?
[00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:52.713]  I'm against the foreigners paying off politicians and being handed our infrastructure.
[00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:55.254]  I'm the bad man.
[00:19:56.775 --> 00:19:58.716]  And phony conservatives like Lars Larson
[00:20:01.897 --> 00:20:03.177]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:09.539]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:13.540]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.780]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.120]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:25.022]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[00:20:25.162 --> 00:20:26.283]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:46.742]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:20:47.082 --> 00:20:49.683]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.884 --> 00:20:56.005]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:02.554]  Can't we stop?
[00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:04.395]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:21:04.816 --> 00:21:05.056]  What?
[00:21:05.416 --> 00:21:05.776]  Again?
[00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:07.817]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:21:07.897 --> 00:21:12.320]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.841]  Why did you do that?
[00:21:14.061 --> 00:21:19.864]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:21.185]  Are we there yet?
[00:21:21.285 --> 00:21:22.345]  for the entire trip.
[00:21:22.585 --> 00:21:24.807]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:26.307]  Great idea.
[00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:29.149]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:21:29.508 --> 00:21:31.974]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:21:32.174 --> 00:21:36.564]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:37.166]  Honey!
[00:21:37.987 --> 00:21:39.228]  You're terrific!
[00:21:39.628 --> 00:21:41.108]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:44.630]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:45.711]  Now, can we stop?
[00:21:46.191 --> 00:21:46.951]  I need to go, too.

[00:22:03.596 --> 00:22:08.538]  Did you know that Russia sponsored a terrorist training camp in Havana, Cuba in 1966?
[00:22:09.138 --> 00:22:14.801]  In this camp, they planned terrorist activity on every continent, including the United States.
[00:22:15.441 --> 00:22:19.303]  Have we seen terrorist activities on every continent just as they planned?

[00:24:01.874 --> 00:24:07.059]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.982]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.855 --> 00:24:17.380]  Let's look at one little tiny facet of how they're going to use the roads as total surveillance and taxation grids.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:27.268]  I learned about nine years ago that already in Indiana and Texas and other states license plates scanning instant read
[00:24:28.984 --> 00:24:29.424]  I think?
[00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:49.896]  Not one horse, four horse.
[00:24:50.436 --> 00:24:55.841]  You know, small towns, I meant to say every four-way stop, even in a one-horse town, has these.
[00:24:56.681 --> 00:25:02.426]  And the LAPD was the first to announce three years ago that it's going on many other police cars.
[00:25:02.846 --> 00:25:06.689]  You heard about the Florida town where every car that comes through it, they run your plates.
[00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:15.076]  But this is a TV documentary we've got a clip of, and we're putting it up on JonesReport.com in the next hour or so.
[00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:19.504]  This is where they admit that it's not just criminals, though.
[00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:22.686]  Everybody's data is being logged and mined.
[00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:23.887]  Okay?
[00:25:24.688 --> 00:25:30.592]  So, now again, I'm the conspiracy theorist nine years ago when I'm reading government documents on air.
[00:25:30.972 --> 00:25:41.959]  Now it's announced, and I'm still evil and bad because I don't like being under total surveillance while the borders wide open and illegal aliens don't have to show ID to get bank accounts or housing loans.
[00:25:42.637 --> 00:25:46.420]  Because again, this is not about controlling crime or stopping terrorism.
[00:25:46.741 --> 00:25:50.123]  It's about micromanaging and letting you know you're a slave.
[00:25:50.564 --> 00:25:53.326]  That's why the police, everybody's been ordered to be rude to us.
[00:25:53.826 --> 00:25:56.709]  The people at the airports have been ordered to let us know they're the boss.
[00:25:57.129 --> 00:26:00.712]  It's all about humiliation and our journey into enslavement.
[00:26:00.932 --> 00:26:01.313]  Here it is.
[00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:11.040]  The Long Beach Police Department has recently acquired new technology that allows officers to automatically read license plates and compare them to wanted vehicle databases.
[00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:15.245]  This is called ALPR or Automated License Plate Recognition.
[00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:22.334]  Each ALPR vehicle has three cameras mounted on the light bar that can read license plates in all weather and in complete darkness.
[00:26:23.104 --> 00:26:26.406]  Each camera contains both a color overview and infrared camera.
[00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:29.768]  The system compares plates to four databases at this time.
[00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:37.553]  We are searching for wanted felony vehicles, local wanted vehicles, stolen vehicles, and vehicles with lost or stolen license plates.
[00:26:38.093 --> 00:26:42.956]  If the system finds a match in a database, the officer will be alerted both visually and audibly.
[00:26:45.197 --> 00:26:46.939]  Now we want to get all the new information.
[00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:50.140]  All the stolen vehicles that are out in the field.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.582]  So what we're going to do is we're just going to hit begin shift.
[00:26:53.228 --> 00:26:54.469]  The process is wireless.
[00:26:56.211 --> 00:27:00.034]  It's now uploading all the databases, and it's done.
[00:27:00.054 --> 00:27:08.742]  What we're seeing is typically between 3,000 and 4,000 plates a shift being read and compared to the database.
[00:27:09.182 --> 00:27:15.748]  Opposed to the old way, which is just manually inputting plates on the computer, the quickest guy, I think we saw 150, 200 a shift.
[00:27:17.782 --> 00:27:23.766]  So you're comparing a lot of information that you normally just would have driven right by to databases.
[00:27:25.988 --> 00:27:27.649]  So basically you're just cruising down the lot.
[00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:32.433]  You can go, you could be going 50 miles an hour and it will read them.
[00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:39.518]  Obviously the slower you go the better, but it's pretty efficient.
[00:27:41.379 --> 00:27:41.699]  I'm going 80.
[00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:49.654]  I'm sketching the cars going the opposite direction, and I'm sure going at least 80.
[00:27:53.278 --> 00:28:00.067]  And if you're driving along, and the computer actually sees the car,
[00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:05.469]  You'll get a hit.
[00:28:05.649 --> 00:28:10.271]  And it takes about one second from when the camera sees it to when it displays on the screen.
[00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:15.152]  But it automatically pops up, so you don't have to worry about fumbling with the computer and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:15.512 --> 00:28:18.273]  And to verify it, obviously, you just go back to your Tiburon screen.
[00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:27.476]  If something happens, and you're on a call, and say a 211 goes out, you have the ability to manually input plates into the system as well.
[00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:32.257]  To do that, what you'll do is you'll just hit Manual Plate Entry.
[00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:34.802]  Let's see this truck up here.
[00:28:35.822 --> 00:28:46.727]  Um... Call goes out... It's 7... Charles 65... 885, right?
[00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:49.868]  Hit play.
[00:28:50.508 --> 00:28:52.729]  There's no match in the system.
[00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:54.270]  We're just gonna make a note.
[00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.371]  It's a... It's just gonna be a test, but you can put whatever you want it into there.
[00:28:58.391 --> 00:28:59.852]  Hit save.
[00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:01.853]  Now the next time you see it,
[00:29:04.693 --> 00:29:10.796]  It's going to turn off, but as soon as it sees the plate, the alarm will go off.
[00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:13.298]  And it gives you all the information that you inputted.
[00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:19.841]  It gives you a picture of the car, the plate as it saw it, and then the plate as it interpreted it to be.
[00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:26.124]  The machine will keep every single read that you've collected until you downshift, or endshift.
[00:29:26.144 --> 00:29:31.307]  Just hit the next button, and you can actually toggle through every single plate.
[00:29:33.869 --> 00:29:34.489]  That you read.
[00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:41.433]  Alright, we'll be right back and let this clip finish up, then I'll tell you how this is really being used.
[00:29:42.153 --> 00:29:47.336]  And it's not just in the police cars, we've got a bunch of other audio clips we'll be playing and analyzing.
[00:29:47.356 --> 00:29:49.156]  We'll also take some calls and go to John Turner.
[00:29:51.618 --> 00:29:52.498]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.998 --> 00:29:54.599]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.201]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:04.456]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.956 --> 00:30:08.278]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:08.658 --> 00:30:11.600]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:18.244]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.324 --> 00:30:22.727]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:22.967 --> 00:30:27.329]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:27.469 --> 00:30:30.090]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.871]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.351 --> 00:30:35.872]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:35.912 --> 00:30:40.174]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:40.234 --> 00:30:41.074]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.354 --> 00:30:45.979]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.801]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[00:31:16.118 --> 00:31:18.378]  1971, Nissan closes the gold window.
[00:31:18.438 --> 00:31:19.279]  Fiat currency.
[00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:23.879]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:31:24.219 --> 00:31:26.080]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.000]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.681]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:37.042]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:31:37.122 --> 00:31:41.822]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:31:41.982 --> 00:31:43.263]  Could government let this happen?
[00:31:43.403 --> 00:31:45.343]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:31:45.623 --> 00:31:52.673]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:31:52.713 --> 00:31:54.455]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:55.637]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:31:55.677 --> 00:31:55.977]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.222]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:04.482 --> 00:32:06.523]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:06.663 --> 00:32:13.688]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:13.968 --> 00:32:22.554]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:32:22.654 --> 00:32:22.854]  Yes!

[00:32:50.852 --> 00:32:54.175]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:32:54.195 --> 00:32:56.996]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[00:33:09.874 --> 00:33:33.516]  There was something so different about that place Even your emotions had an echo in so much space And when you're out there, without care, yeah I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much
[00:33:48.954 --> 00:33:49.474]  Possibly.
[00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:56.635]  Welcome back.
[00:33:57.756 --> 00:33:59.756]  We've got a lot of audio clips today.
[00:34:00.816 --> 00:34:01.856]  When it rains, it pours.
[00:34:01.896 --> 00:34:03.017]  They're all very important.
[00:34:03.097 --> 00:34:07.157]  The next one I'm going to get to here in a few minutes is 60 Minutes on Sunday.
[00:34:07.177 --> 00:34:14.399]  A CIA official revealed that Bush, Cheney, Rice were personally told Iraq had no WMDs in the fall of 2002.
[00:34:14.479 --> 00:34:16.859]  We'll be getting to that.
[00:34:19.548 --> 00:34:37.879]  I also want to cover how Gibson on Fox News is trying to demonize 9-11 truthers, basically with a straw man argument that reeks of COINTELPRO with this Gary Bonaduce person.
[00:34:40.421 --> 00:34:46.765]  And then I want to actually play some of what John Connor actually said to him there on the side of a street at a little cafe.
[00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:54.256]  But let me go back and finish up with these cop car scanners.
[00:34:56.036 --> 00:35:11.862]  Why doesn't the national media have a bunch of fanfare about the fact that for nine years, and that's what I know of, many states had test arrays of cameras hooked into the software packages
[00:35:13.184 --> 00:35:16.845]  that scan the plates, read the plates of every car.
[00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:22.768]  In fact, some of these software packages can read hundreds of plates simultaneously.
[00:35:24.248 --> 00:35:26.989]  Packed roads, both sides, they're reading it all.
[00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:40.374]  This technology was developed by the NSA for satellite surveillance so that computers could artificially recognize numbers and other
[00:35:42.947 --> 00:35:48.129]  Key things that then would flag it for human analysis, because there's so much surveillance.
[00:35:48.169 --> 00:35:50.890]  That's what a lot of this AI technology does.
[00:35:53.571 --> 00:35:58.252]  No, they're selling it to you in Texas and Florida and California with... Oh!
[00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:01.733]  LA got 40 units!
[00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:03.594]  San Diego got 10 units!
[00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:06.975]  Dallas got 10 units!
[00:36:07.115 --> 00:36:08.816]  Under federal grants, I would add.
[00:36:11.207 --> 00:36:14.608]  Boston got 20-something units, and we see these reports every week.
[00:36:16.588 --> 00:36:18.248]  Chicago got a bunch of units.
[00:36:18.648 --> 00:36:24.829]  Oh, the feds are paying for two billion dollars worth of camera systems in New York.
[00:36:25.549 --> 00:36:26.790]  900 million in Dallas.
[00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.890]  I mean, it's just that constantly we read these stories.
[00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:34.271]  Then you go read, you see the company name, you go find out, you go spot check, you go pull it.
[00:36:34.911 --> 00:36:37.932]  It's not just license plate reading.
[00:36:38.332 --> 00:36:39.512]  It's face scanning arrays.
[00:36:39.532 --> 00:36:40.232]  That's why you'll have
[00:36:41.253 --> 00:36:44.175]  On a busy pedestrian street, an array of different cameras.
[00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:48.798]  One is hooked into software, and now they're trying to integrate it where one camera feed does all of this.
[00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:54.302]  Where they're reading faces, they're reading walks, they're listening to your speech.
[00:36:55.063 --> 00:36:57.324]  Austin's got hundreds of microphones all over it.
[00:36:57.364 --> 00:37:00.646]  We were one of the test cities, starting in 98, under a federal grant.
[00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:01.987]  I have the front of the statement.
[00:37:02.007 --> 00:37:02.868]  The state's been saying it.
[00:37:03.208 --> 00:37:04.409]  Put it in my film, Police Day 2000, in 99.
[00:37:04.449 --> 00:37:05.470]  And now it's been announced.
[00:37:08.152 --> 00:37:11.254]  Okay, at first they said it was gunshot detectors.
[00:37:11.534 --> 00:37:12.795]  Then I went and pulled the federal grant.
[00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:15.857]  It said microphones to listen to people on the street.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.082]  And now they just admit it's microphones in Austin and every other major city in this country.
[00:37:24.683 --> 00:37:28.866]  In fact, I've even seen microphones, seen reports of microphones in small towns at the park.
[00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:31.348]  Oh, we just have these to make sure there's not a problem.
[00:37:31.368 --> 00:37:34.710]  Now in England, there's not just four and a half million cameras in London.
[00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:35.511]  There's
[00:37:38.012 --> 00:37:40.554]  Untold numbers of microphones going in.
[00:37:42.195 --> 00:37:46.339]  So you see this grid that's being put in place and so they sell it to you.
[00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:47.880]  Oh we're out looking for stolen cars.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:48.781]  Oh really?
[00:37:51.863 --> 00:37:53.144]  You know what the car thieves do?
[00:37:53.184 --> 00:37:54.105]  They steal the car.
[00:37:54.884 --> 00:38:24.484]  And before it's ever even found, stolen, five hours later when you wake up and go outside and your car isn't there, it's already gone to a chop shop, it's already been chopped up, or it's already had its serial numbers removed in the dash, and it's had new plates put on, fake plates, and it's already been loaded onto a truck, and the Border Patrol, there have been huge reports in the LA Times on this, nothing is done as these cars are shipped, there's all the big bribes being made, right over the border, right into Mexico.
[00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:29.383]  Big old tractor trailers full of cars, trains full of cars.
[00:38:29.983 --> 00:38:33.504]  It's a big business and it comes right back into this country.
[00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:38.906]  They just repaint them, change up the basic look, and ship them right back into the U.S.
[00:38:40.887 --> 00:38:45.009]  And then you pay for it with increased premiums on your insurance.
[00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:47.190]  So, and I mean, I had a car stolen in Dallas.
[00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.250]  Cops wouldn't even come out.
[00:38:49.071 --> 00:38:53.892]  I had my car broken into here in Austin, totally ransacked, windows knocked out, everything stolen.
[00:38:54.252 --> 00:38:55.632]  Cops wouldn't even come out.
[00:38:58.113 --> 00:39:00.473]  Oh, but it's to stop car thieves.
[00:39:00.653 --> 00:39:01.454]  Yeah, sure.
[00:39:02.954 --> 00:39:08.635]  And I'm a deep sea North Atlantic lobster.
[00:39:11.536 --> 00:39:13.376]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:39:14.616 --> 00:39:15.637]  Here's another example.
[00:39:16.677 --> 00:39:17.317]  We told you
[00:39:18.024 --> 00:39:36.289]  It was about seven, eight years ago because I was sent a big trucking magazine and it admitted that the feds were going to track all cell phones, not just in real time, that was a separate law they passed in 96, but they were also going to use the cell phones to track traffic congestion.
[00:39:37.569 --> 00:39:38.690]  And I told people about that.
[00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.711]  Again, I'm not that smart, I just know how to read industry publications, I just admitted.
[00:39:44.378 --> 00:39:48.802]  And everybody laughed and giggled, haha, sure they're going to track my location with my cell phone.
[00:39:50.383 --> 00:39:53.886]  And the question was, how were they going to announce and sell this surveillance to you?
[00:39:54.786 --> 00:40:02.072]  Well, sure enough, they've now come out coast to coast, from Montana to Kansas to Texas, it's been in our newspapers.
[00:40:02.092 --> 00:40:02.132]  Oh!
[00:40:03.073 --> 00:40:09.638]  Your city emergency management and traffic centers, all integrated under federal control and federally financed,
[00:40:10.602 --> 00:40:14.924]  are tracking all the cell phones in real time to be able to look at traffic patterns.
[00:40:15.824 --> 00:40:19.826]  Remember when they put up all the cameras and even show them to you on the news, get you acclimated, showing the traffic?
[00:40:19.846 --> 00:40:20.967]  You know, it has a dual use.
[00:40:21.327 --> 00:40:25.289]  Oh, we were given these federal cameras to look at the traffic, to help you get to work quicker.
[00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:33.372]  And, oh, we're going to use the cell phone to track right where you're at, to be able to tell where all the cars are for traffic.
[00:40:33.572 --> 00:40:35.593]  Oh, and for law enforcement.
[00:40:35.653 --> 00:40:36.854]  We forgot to mention that part.
[00:40:37.904 --> 00:40:50.776]  So they always mention some little innocuous or helping reason for this, but if you read last year one of the issues in MIT Magazine, they said the Pentagon designed this at MIT and this is a control grid.
[00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:53.119]  There were several other big mainstream articles last year
[00:40:53.699 --> 00:41:00.125]  As well, where they said, oh, the population surveillance system, it had an even scarier name, I forget it.
[00:41:00.446 --> 00:41:01.887]  It was like something out of a science fiction movie.
[00:41:02.107 --> 00:41:04.149]  The one we developed for Western Europe and the U.S.
[00:41:04.169 --> 00:41:07.112]  that's in place now, we need to put that in Iraq.
[00:41:07.152 --> 00:41:08.053]  That's why it was in the news.
[00:41:08.393 --> 00:41:13.338]  Oh, the same slave grid we're under here, oh, we need to use that in Iraq against them.
[00:41:17.082 --> 00:41:18.503]  See how these people operate?
[00:41:19.668 --> 00:41:28.696]  And then when your neighbor finally hears that his cell phone's listening to him, tracking him, he'll just say, oh, it's for traffic congestion.
[00:41:31.158 --> 00:41:31.979]  And what have they announced?
[00:41:31.999 --> 00:41:42.108]  There's going to be CIA officers under Homeland Security at every emergency management center in every... I mean, even small towns have these.
[00:41:43.169 --> 00:41:44.871]  If it's a mid-sized city like Austin,
[00:41:46.135 --> 00:41:49.337]  You will have a huge command bunker, which they built back in 99.
[00:41:50.658 --> 00:41:52.960]  With county, city, fire department, everybody in there.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.221]  It's all federally controlled.
[00:41:55.241 --> 00:42:02.546]  But then in small towns, and in regions where it's not urban, you'll have on average, say, four counties that come together.
[00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:05.548]  And right in the middle of it, there'll be that guard armory.
[00:42:06.658 --> 00:42:10.440]  I've probably seen 200 news articles or more.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.903]  You're always calling in with it, going, yeah, what you said about the police moving into military bases.
[00:42:15.143 --> 00:42:20.686]  They moved into it, but the guard's keeping an office and runs security there and, quote, advises the police.
[00:42:21.106 --> 00:42:24.188]  And there's a Homeland Security officer that's over the whole thing.
[00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:26.329]  Just go pull it up.
[00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:30.111]  If you've got an old base, chances are the police department's moved into it.
[00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:34.414]  It's now under federal control with troops with that relationship forming.
[00:42:36.337 --> 00:42:38.979]  See, they don't have to come in with the military and take over your police stations.
[00:42:39.179 --> 00:42:48.405]  They just come in with some money, and your police station moves in, and it's now the Tri-County Emergency Command Center.
[00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:50.067]  Or the Quad County.
[00:42:50.647 --> 00:42:52.088]  Just type these names into Google.
[00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:56.091]  Or the Tennessee River Authority
[00:42:57.902 --> 00:42:59.522]  Emergency Management Center.
[00:43:00.083 --> 00:43:01.323]  Just type this stuff in.
[00:43:01.903 --> 00:43:02.463]  And learn.
[00:43:02.543 --> 00:43:03.544]  And go on down.
[00:43:04.024 --> 00:43:08.565]  Just say, hey, I'm doing a paper for college about Homeland Security and how great it is.
[00:43:08.725 --> 00:43:10.125]  They'll probably let you right in.
[00:43:10.145 --> 00:43:17.447]  There'll be big rooms with plasma TVs and guys walking around in uniforms and military men giving orders to police captains.
[00:43:17.487 --> 00:43:18.108]  Yes, sir!
[00:43:18.388 --> 00:43:19.108]  Walking around.
[00:43:19.748 --> 00:43:21.710]  And of course there's no real terrorist, no real threat.
[00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.675]  The cameras are picking up illegal aliens who they don't have a face print off of from the driver's license photo.
[00:43:26.715 --> 00:43:27.675]  They ignore all that.
[00:43:27.836 --> 00:43:30.058]  They could round up all the illegals in a matter of weeks!
[00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:33.450]  No, none of it's going to be used for that.
[00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:34.750]  It's for scanning.
[00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.912]  And see, they're putting in all this software, and it's wired in.
[00:43:39.312 --> 00:43:43.194]  The Austin Emergency Management Center can dial in the cameras all over the country.
[00:43:43.214 --> 00:43:44.814]  It was on C-SPAN a few years ago.
[00:43:44.834 --> 00:43:45.315]  My dad calls.
[00:43:45.355 --> 00:43:45.915]  He's eating breakfast.
[00:43:45.935 --> 00:43:47.015]  He goes, tune into C-SPAN.
[00:43:47.215 --> 00:43:48.396]  They were just showing Austin.
[00:43:48.696 --> 00:43:56.659]  And they had the federal transportation head on, and they got a big screen up, and they're showing the C-SPAN interviewer, look here, we can show you this city.
[00:43:56.699 --> 00:43:57.680]  We can show you that city.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.400]  Here's LA.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.180]  Here's Boston.
[00:43:59.521 --> 00:44:00.241]  Here's Austin.
[00:44:02.674 --> 00:44:02.914]  See?
[00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:21.627]  Just flipping through the channels, and then the New York Times comes out and says, oh, they're going to try to have an after-school program where if you want to graduate from high school, the state says you have to volunteer for two semesters to watch surveillance cameras and help the police.
[00:44:22.447 --> 00:44:23.808]  And see, now it's being announced.
[00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:26.963]  And so see, citizens are going to be dialed in too.
[00:44:27.303 --> 00:44:27.483]  Oh!
[00:44:27.863 --> 00:44:35.069]  In fact, in London you can subscribe with your cable package and get to yourself dial in with a little computer key and look at different cameras.
[00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:37.671]  So you don't worry about Big Brother.
[00:44:37.751 --> 00:44:38.512]  You can help.
[00:44:38.692 --> 00:44:39.653]  You can be part of it.
[00:44:43.236 --> 00:44:46.839]  Alright, I'm burning our time up and I want to get to all these clips.
[00:44:46.939 --> 00:44:48.200]  We've got several guests today.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.803]  Again, it's so complex.
[00:44:51.823 --> 00:44:53.344]  There's so many layers to this evil.
[00:44:53.404 --> 00:44:54.445]  I can't even cover it all.
[00:44:56.395 --> 00:45:12.331]  And I remember reading, starting out in Wisconsin as the first place they announced it, that, oh, we're going to have to have a new cell phone tax in the state to pay to have the officers that sit in the command center, and the officers were all surprised.
[00:45:12.351 --> 00:45:14.052]  They go, oh, we didn't know we had this capability.
[00:45:14.293 --> 00:45:17.215]  See, the feds are there every month going, oh, here's a new capability now.
[00:45:17.496 --> 00:45:20.719]  We're going to teach everybody in the command center about this new capability.
[00:45:21.497 --> 00:45:30.524]  We're now going to show you in live time everyone's cell phone by their name as a red blip on the screen and it can be integrated with a database to check for warrants.
[00:45:30.764 --> 00:45:33.186]  And so you see these red dots on the screen?
[00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:36.529]  These are felons right now driving around in the city.
[00:45:38.591 --> 00:45:39.752]  Well, why don't we go bust them?
[00:45:39.812 --> 00:45:42.133]  Well, we're not ready to implement this program yet.
[00:45:43.334 --> 00:45:47.698]  And the cops just see because they haven't announced it to everyone yet.
[00:45:49.145 --> 00:46:17.252]  And so they've got the cell phones tracking you, the license plate reading cameras tracking you, the face scanning cameras tracking you, and then all over the country, the feds are lobbying, international companies are lobbying, states are passing it to put in tracker chips, RFID chips, and all the inspection stickers to tax you as you drive down the road, and as it said in the bill here in Texas, we nearly beat a few years ago, they're trying to implement now by fiat, the minute your insurance runs out, the minute
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:25.865]  You are instantly flagged and it's going to come up on a computer screen that they're now installing in police cars all over the country, again with federal grants.
[00:46:26.905 --> 00:46:27.806]  Go ahead and laugh, police.
[00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:30.948]  You'll be getting it in the next few months or in the next year or two, depending on where you are.
[00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:32.189]  Then, of course, you'll love it.
[00:46:32.209 --> 00:46:34.831]  Because it's such a great way to stop criminals, right?
[00:46:34.871 --> 00:46:36.952]  Except criminals run the government.
[00:46:38.513 --> 00:46:46.919]  And false info can be put in by design on people's records, as they are doing to Professor Boyle we had on.
[00:46:47.848 --> 00:46:57.531]  Just two days ago, who wrote our biological weapons treaty because he's out exposing government involvement in anthrax and because he's out fighting the New World Order and calling for Bush's impeachment.
[00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:04.141]  He now basically can't fly and gets harassed everywhere he goes because he's on the no-fly list.
[00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:18.506]  And again, Governor Ridge, when they were founding Homeland Security in 2002, on C-SPAN said, it's all going to be on your ID card with that ID number attached to a database, everything you do, everything you say, everything you are.
[00:47:22.662 --> 00:47:24.783]  Let's go to this, uh, an upset.
[00:47:24.803 --> 00:47:25.824]  I mean, that's only one chapter.
[00:47:26.064 --> 00:47:29.025]  Listen, it would take ten hours to even try to tell you everything about it.
[00:47:29.506 --> 00:47:30.846]  Okay, it's that bad, folks.
[00:47:31.186 --> 00:47:34.308]  I mean, Google's saying they're going to use cameras and microphones to listen to you and watch you.
[00:47:34.688 --> 00:47:38.650]  I've got a mainstream news article here today admitting that the new video games watch you.
[00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:41.011]  Oh, I'm not kidding.
[00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:43.453]  See, this is mega-tyranny.
[00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:45.874]  Nothing to do with fighting criminals.
[00:47:46.094 --> 00:47:47.715]  It's about enslaving and controlling you.
[00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:55.974]  Let's go to this clip where a high-level CIA officer, the head of the CIA's Europe Division, Section Chief, talks about how they knew there were no WMDs.
[00:47:56.194 --> 00:47:57.234]  Here it is from 60 Minutes.
[00:47:58.895 --> 00:48:04.098]  Meanwhile, the CIA had made a major intelligence breakthrough on Iraq's nuclear program.
[00:48:04.818 --> 00:48:11.861]  Nagi Sabri, Iraq's foreign minister, had made a deal to reveal Iraq's military secrets to the CIA.
[00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:15.503]  Tyler Drumheller was in charge of the operation.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.143]  Inner Circle Saddam Hussein, someone who would know what he was talking about.
[00:48:22.163 --> 00:48:23.404]  You knew you could trust this guy.
[00:48:23.544 --> 00:48:25.386]  We continued to validate him the whole way through.
[00:48:25.886 --> 00:48:33.653]  According to Drumheller, CIA Director George Tenet delivered the news about the Iraqi Foreign Minister at a high-level meeting at the White House.
[00:48:34.874 --> 00:48:36.956]  The President, the Vice President, Dr. Rice.
[00:48:37.436 --> 00:48:38.557]  And at that meeting?
[00:48:38.597 --> 00:48:42.821]  They were enthusiastic because they said, they were excited that we had a high-level
[00:48:43.994 --> 00:48:45.535]  Uh, penetration of Iraqis.
[00:48:46.215 --> 00:48:48.016]  And what did this high level source tell you?
[00:48:48.436 --> 00:48:53.798]  He told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program.
[00:48:54.119 --> 00:49:05.564]  So, in the fall of 2002, before going to war, we had it on good authority from a source within Saddam's inner circle that he didn't have an active program for weapons of mass destruction?
[00:49:06.758 --> 00:49:07.839]  There's no doubt in your mind about it.
[00:49:07.859 --> 00:49:08.739]  No doubt in my mind at all.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.664]  It directly contradicts what the President and staff were telling us.
[00:49:15.184 --> 00:49:16.205]  The policy was set.
[00:49:16.885 --> 00:49:21.209]  The war in Iraq was coming and they were looking for intelligence to fit into the policy.
[00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:22.710]  And then... To justify the policy.
[00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.252]  And then... The Drummer never expected the White House... That's good.
[00:49:25.652 --> 00:49:26.673]  And then a few months later...
[00:49:28.456 --> 00:49:36.779]  They have the White House meeting with Blair, and they say, well, we'll just stage a defector coming out and claiming he saw WMDs, or we can get it, fly a plane low, paint it up like a U.N.
[00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:40.681]  plane, get it shot down.
[00:49:41.601 --> 00:49:43.642]  But still, neocons are on talk radio.
[00:49:43.742 --> 00:49:45.203]  Every day I tune in, I hear this.
[00:49:45.263 --> 00:49:46.303]  I mean, it's like a mantra.
[00:49:46.703 --> 00:49:48.184]  They found mobile weapons trucks.
[00:49:48.224 --> 00:49:49.625]  They found the deserting gas.
[00:49:49.665 --> 00:49:50.725]  They found blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:51.661 --> 00:49:54.183]  Those mobile weapons trucks were pumping up hot air balloons.
[00:49:54.724 --> 00:49:55.284]  They knew it.
[00:49:55.845 --> 00:49:56.885]  Actually, hydrogen balloons.
[00:49:57.326 --> 00:49:59.247]  They knew that from the start.
[00:50:01.209 --> 00:50:02.490]  It had the British serial numbers.
[00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.071]  It was in Jane's Weapons Quarterly.
[00:50:04.472 --> 00:50:07.294]  They knew exactly what it was the minute the British found it.
[00:50:08.015 --> 00:50:11.958]  And they just, for months, we found mobile anthrax labs.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.522]  That reminds me of the time we got it on video.
[00:50:16.582 --> 00:50:20.545]  It's in Road to Tyranny, where they pull over one of our listeners, Farrell Montgomery,
[00:50:21.149 --> 00:50:23.271]  And we have it because it was chopper video of all this.
[00:50:24.232 --> 00:50:27.214]  And he gets out, hands up, didn't do anything wrong.
[00:50:27.534 --> 00:50:35.721]  They taser him, let a dog chew on him, and then they wanted to act like it was okay, so they pull out jumper cables, they're jumper cables, and hold them up and say, look, pipe bombs!
[00:50:36.542 --> 00:50:38.103]  Jumper cables are pipe bombs!
[00:50:39.084 --> 00:50:41.786]  Balloon trucks are anthrax machines!
[00:50:45.449 --> 00:50:46.390]  You like being lied to?
[00:50:47.191 --> 00:50:47.511]  You like
[00:50:48.227 --> 00:50:50.688]  This criminal government that ships in narcotics for your children?
[00:50:50.988 --> 00:50:52.249]  That puts mercury in your vaccines?
[00:50:52.289 --> 00:50:53.769]  I mean, that gets rid of your borders?
[00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:54.750]  That destroys your country?
[00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:55.850]  You like it?
[00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.371]  Well good then, enjoy it!
[00:50:57.791 --> 00:50:58.491]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.472 --> 00:51:07.455]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.815 --> 00:51:09.756]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.116 --> 00:51:17.719]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:25.513]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.894 --> 00:51:37.319]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:41.141]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:43.502]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.862 --> 00:51:47.644]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:43.722]  I do want to briefly tell you that I had never had time to put my first seven films, America Destroyed by Design,
[00:54:44.426 --> 00:54:49.790]  The Masters of Terror, Police State 1, 2, and 3, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports exposed.
[00:54:51.531 --> 00:54:53.112]  I have never put these films on DVD.
[00:54:53.132 --> 00:54:55.474]  I've been too busy to do it.
[00:54:56.095 --> 00:55:06.622]  My first seven films, the classics, are now all on DVD and we've got, you can get all three of the Police State films for $34.95 for a limited time in a box set on three different DVDs.

[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.361]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:56:15.381 --> 00:56:17.723]  I want to quickly say I heard you, I got two comments here.
[00:56:17.743 --> 00:56:20.665]  I heard you on George Norrie and you were asking him what part of the road to tyranny he liked.
[00:56:43.095 --> 00:56:43.415]  I just want
[00:57:00.013 --> 00:57:00.993]  Um, yeah.
[00:57:01.354 --> 00:57:06.836]  We start the film by showing the admissions of where criminals in our government have staged terror.
[00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:07.636]  This is admitted!
[00:57:07.996 --> 00:57:08.216]  Right.
[00:57:08.516 --> 00:57:13.178]  So that way anybody, all the people they have in their minds, oh no, the government, you know, would never do anything wrong.
[00:57:13.378 --> 00:57:16.959]  My neighbor, he's evil, and the guy who just cut me off, he's evil, but the government, they're great, you know.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.141]  So it, you know, you really thoroughly document specifically.
[00:57:20.161 --> 00:57:23.042]  Yeah, my neighbor gave me a dirty look, he's bad, but I trust my government.
[00:57:23.282 --> 00:57:23.562]  Right.
[00:57:24.042 --> 00:57:28.724]  It's totally inane, but, uh, you know, as I say, you know, with really documented cases,
[00:57:29.834 --> 00:57:34.338]  You know, like I said, the idea of proof of concept is really big in engineering and stuff.
[00:57:35.759 --> 00:57:41.343]  The second thing I want to talk about is a possible big aspect of this, of September 11th.
[00:57:43.225 --> 00:57:44.746]  Are you familiar with who Thomas Barnett is?
[00:57:45.947 --> 00:57:46.267]  Yes.
[00:57:46.707 --> 00:57:49.510]  Okay, yeah, he wrote, he's kind of a pseudo-neocon.
[00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:50.671]  The Pentagon's new map.
[00:57:51.411 --> 00:57:54.493]  Exactly, yeah, he wrote that for Vanity Fair and he was on a big speaking tour for that.
[00:57:55.014 --> 00:57:57.596]  Okay, I like studying warfare, I write science fiction, so
[00:57:58.158 --> 00:58:16.003]  I watch interviews with him, and I saw an interview with him on Google Video, and he was talking, you know, just kind of giving his biography, his professional biography and the like, and he was saying in the mid-90s he worked for the Naval War College, and in the mid-90s, Cantor Fitzgerald commissioned the Naval War College as the think tank for economic war games.
[00:58:16.883 --> 00:58:21.985]  And he was saying, and let's see here, Cantor Fitzgerald, that's just,
[00:58:23.123 --> 00:58:29.405]  Cantor Fitzgerald, they lost 600 employees in the World Trade Center, more than any other company, including the New York Fire Department.
[00:58:30.005 --> 00:58:37.667]  And on September 14th, three days later, they already had an economic plan in place for the... Tell you what, stay there to briefly finish your point.
[00:58:37.687 --> 00:58:39.547]  When we get back, send me that Google clip.
[00:58:41.208 --> 00:58:45.129]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.449 --> 00:58:46.229]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:57.907]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.567 --> 00:58:59.628]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:01.528]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.088 --> 00:59:02.909]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.669 --> 00:59:04.569]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:08.951]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:13.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:22.376]  Coming up in the next segment, we're getting an update from John Connor, who just goes out trying to get attention to 9-11.
[00:59:22.516 --> 00:59:24.837]  It's being an inside job.
[00:59:25.825 --> 00:59:30.427]  With the twit Gary Bonaduce, which the whole thing looks like a staged Cointelpro op.
[00:59:31.947 --> 00:59:36.849]  How they're hyping and claiming 9-11 truthers have been threatening him and John Gibson on Fox News.
[00:59:37.409 --> 00:59:41.270]  And it integrates with another clip I'm going to play later in the hour of O'Reilly with Kevin Barrett.
[00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:43.111]  He doesn't want to debate 9-11.
[00:59:43.211 --> 00:59:47.272]  He just wants to call him names and, you know, claim we're all a bunch of kooks.
[00:59:47.332 --> 00:59:52.194]  I want to analyze media here and how they respond and the different operations they run.
[00:59:53.234 --> 00:59:55.255]  We're going to get to Jim and John and
[00:59:56.204 --> 00:59:58.064]  Everybody else is patiently holding as well.
[00:59:58.645 --> 01:00:25.010]  David in Michigan called in and was talking about Thomas Barnett, who openly, he's with the Naval War College, he's one of the top futurist strategists, he gets up on C-SPAN, we played clips of it, and says that the military works for Wall Street and the New World Order, he says, for world government, and he just says it's all wonderful, and how wonderful China is, and how we're just going to merge with them,
[01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:27.603]  It's totally sick.
[01:00:28.804 --> 01:00:31.625]  And then I had him set up as a guest one time, and he refused to come on.
[01:00:31.645 --> 01:00:36.346]  It was guest time, and it was this time about two years ago.
[01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:39.087]  We were calling him during this segment for the second hour.
[01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:40.247]  We tend to put guests.
[01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:42.928]  I called him during the break, and I said, why won't you come on?
[01:00:42.968 --> 01:00:43.788]  He was livid.
[01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:50.770]  And let me tell you, you know when you're talking to one of them, he was, how dare you say the government was behind 9-11?
[01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.051]  I'm not going to give you any credibility with coming on.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.760]  And I said, we're going to defeat you.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.101]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:00:57.481 --> 01:00:59.081]  And he was like, no, you're not.
[01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:00.842]  You just keep on dreaming.
[01:01:00.862 --> 01:01:03.243]  I mean, imagine, you're on the phone with him.
[01:01:03.283 --> 01:01:05.163]  I mean, this stuff's real, folks.
[01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:07.364]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:08.704]  America will prevail.
[01:01:11.365 --> 01:01:13.846]  And he's literally going, uh-huh, you just keep on dreaming.
[01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.786]  Imagine, I'm going, we're going to defeat you.
[01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:17.867]  And I know who I'm talking to.
[01:01:18.067 --> 01:01:18.847]  We're going to defeat you.
[01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.027]  America will prevail.
[01:01:21.188 --> 01:01:22.528]  You just keep on dreaming, then.
[01:01:25.026 --> 01:01:35.553]  So, yeah, there was a lot of suspicious stuff of people in the buildings, companies, all their CEOs gone for that weird Offutt Air Force Base meeting with Bush later in the day.
[01:01:35.573 --> 01:01:38.475]  But they were there early that morning told to wait for a secret meeting.
[01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:43.078]  It was a way to get the CEOs out, I guess, without telling them everything.
[01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:45.820]  But go back and finish up the point you were making about Barnett.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:52.364]  Well, just that Google video, if you just type in Thomas Barnett, I think it's one of my two or three videos that comes up.
[01:01:52.384 --> 01:01:54.806]  It's just like an hour long sit down interview with him.
[01:01:55.336 --> 01:02:06.458]  And he just says when he's working at the Naval War College, Cantor Fitzgerald commissioned them to play economic war games and hypothesize what a terrorist attack and stuff like that would do.
[01:02:06.878 --> 01:02:12.299]  And Cantor Fitzgerald, just for the record, is a company, at that time they had over $70 trillion in annual transactions.
[01:02:12.419 --> 01:02:18.920]  Obviously transactions doesn't mean revenue or profits, but they were a huge, huge company.
[01:02:19.341 --> 01:02:21.561]  Now, it's worth noting,
[01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:23.046]  We've got about 30 seconds.
[01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.207]  Go ahead and come to the point.
[01:02:47.893 --> 01:02:54.198]  I'm sorry, I don't have a broader point than that, but the Cameron Fitzgerald connection on 9-11 is worth investigating.
[01:02:54.939 --> 01:03:01.324]  And a really quick plug, your next guest might be interested in www.jamescameron.blogspot.com.
[01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:01.985]  That's my site.
[01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:03.186]  So keep up the great work, Alex.
[01:03:03.967 --> 01:03:04.747]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:06.028]  I appreciate you coming on.
[01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:08.010]  And again, I said I'd go to calls quickly.
[01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:14.055]  I went to his call and gave him about seven minutes of talk time because he's making a really important point.
[01:03:14.555 --> 01:03:16.097]  He's bringing up an important individual.
[01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:20.855]  One of the technicians that operates the Technocracy.
[01:03:22.276 --> 01:03:42.842]  And whether it's Dick Cheney on C-SPAN bragging about how he kept his CFR membership secret, from his constituents and laughing, to Thomas Barnett saying, we work for one world government, to off-air the guy, you know, when I say the New World Order will be defeated, America will prevail, and he just says, you just keep on dreaming.
[01:03:43.722 --> 01:03:46.003]  Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
[01:03:47.045 --> 01:03:48.446]  I mean, what's he saying when he says that?
[01:03:48.686 --> 01:03:50.768]  He's saying, yeah, America's going down.
[01:03:50.788 --> 01:03:56.614]  It's here.
[01:03:56.794 --> 01:04:01.578]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:09.565]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:17.322]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:29.128]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.468 --> 01:04:33.050]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:35.351]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.691 --> 01:04:39.513]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.873 --> 01:04:53.634]  Terrorism!
[01:04:53.794 --> 01:04:54.534]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.654 --> 01:05:00.698]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:02.559]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:05.281]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:20.230]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.590]  government.
[01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:22.571]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.951 --> 01:05:28.853]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:33.474]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:53.931 --> 01:05:59.352]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:05:59.792 --> 01:06:04.513]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:04.913 --> 01:06:07.534]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:08.034 --> 01:06:11.435]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:12.215 --> 01:06:16.536]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:16.976 --> 01:06:20.156]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:20.756 --> 01:06:23.597]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:26.516]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:26.536 --> 01:06:28.637]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:28.657 --> 01:06:28.697]  U.S.
[01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.759]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:31.079]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:31.099 --> 01:06:31.979]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:06:32.019 --> 01:06:32.660]  Ask for George.
[01:06:53.088 --> 01:06:58.709]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.812 --> 01:07:19.493]  Remember the young 10-year-old, now 11 years old, a few months ago, who was at the Steiner
[01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:32.943]  Middle school and he during the computer lab went to Infowars.com and they told him that was a terrorist website.
[01:07:33.364 --> 01:07:34.325]  He wasn't allowed to.
[01:07:34.385 --> 01:07:35.386]  They reprimanded him.
[01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:37.189]  They wanted psychological evaluation.
[01:07:39.105 --> 01:07:43.527]  And then we wrote a big story about it, and now the principal's freaking out, claiming they're getting threatened.
[01:07:43.567 --> 01:07:47.269]  The teacher, quote, wants him out of her class, claiming she's been threatened.
[01:07:47.289 --> 01:07:48.430]  So let's punish the child.
[01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.271]  You violate his rights.
[01:07:50.331 --> 01:07:51.271]  You demonize him.
[01:07:51.611 --> 01:07:54.953]  He gets called a terrorist at the front of the classroom by other kids.
[01:07:55.273 --> 01:07:56.214]  He gets pulled out.
[01:07:56.674 --> 01:07:58.475]  He gets in all this trouble.
[01:07:59.298 --> 01:08:01.220]  And then somebody supposedly threatens you.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.122]  Now usually when they say this they're making it up.
[01:08:03.562 --> 01:08:16.695]  But other cases we found that mental patients and crazies and feds and trolls and minions go out and they threaten people to then get the response they want.
[01:08:17.956 --> 01:08:20.218]  To then be able to blame it on patriots.
[01:08:20.278 --> 01:08:20.939]  Blame it on 9-11 truthers.
[01:08:24.199 --> 01:08:38.267]  And this is just an example of how these people operate, and so now they're trying to punish this young man there at the school here in Austin, Texas, in Travis County.
[01:08:39.708 --> 01:08:49.894]  John Connor has been doing a great job calling in the national talk shows, Larry King Live, television, over and over again, putting out key 9-11 information, skull and bones information,
[01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:52.650]  He's been able to get a lot of publicity.
[01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.250]  He took media in college.
[01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:55.390]  He's a smart guy.
[01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.751]  We should all be doing similar things.
[01:08:56.811 --> 01:08:58.611]  I've been doing similar things, of course, for years.
[01:09:00.152 --> 01:09:07.294]  Really kind of pioneered this more modern form of gonzo journalism and combining it with ambush journalism.
[01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:09.975]  And we commend John Connor on what he's been doing.
[01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:10.755]  We need leaders.
[01:09:11.316 --> 01:09:13.416]  We need more of you to become leaders and do similar things.
[01:09:13.456 --> 01:09:18.238]  He goes into big college rooms, dorms, buildings, the streets.
[01:09:18.985 --> 01:09:19.886]  We're good to go.
[01:09:39.273 --> 01:09:50.202]  Danny Bonaducci has been all over Fox Radio, Fox TV, Glenn Beck.
[01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:57.988]  I mean I constantly see him and hear him and I'm not watching much television so he must be like one of their favorite little pet minions or something.
[01:09:59.173 --> 01:10:13.262]  And so John Connor, along with his friend, the fellow that worked at the Bohemian Grove and shot that video for us last year that we put in the Order of Death, they were able to get footage
[01:10:14.597 --> 01:10:16.237]  And here's the audio from that footage.
[01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.618]  But first, let's go ahead and go to John Connor.
[01:10:18.638 --> 01:10:25.440]  John, describe the video, audio, that we're about to play for our listeners out there since they can't see it.
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:35.562]  It's up on InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com right now, but for those that won't have internet and can't go see it, why don't you describe what we're about to play?
[01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:45.597]  Codename Kyle and I were hanging out in Hollywood shooting a video on another related matter when he spotted Bonaduce sitting outside by himself at an outdoor cafe.
[01:10:46.278 --> 01:10:50.400]  So we started rolling the camera and I just walked right up to him and said, can I bother you for two seconds?
[01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:53.182]  Do you think 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:10:53.202 --> 01:10:56.945]  The audio isn't the greatest for the first few seconds and then it becomes very clear.
[01:10:57.632 --> 01:11:13.500]  And, uh, he brushed it off as, those are conspiracy theorists, and then as soon as I asked him if he heard of a plan for our own government to commit terrorism and blame it on someone else, he completely freaked out, started dropping the f-word repeatedly, and I just started laughing.
[01:11:14.073 --> 01:11:25.040]  Uh, right in his face, and he told me that I was nobody, that nobody's gonna care about this interview, and so I just started laughing and thought, you know, this... We'll put this on YouTube, we'll see who cares about this.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:30.303]  And now the 9-11 Truth Movement and myself are under one of the biggest assaults.
[01:11:30.934 --> 01:11:31.495]  I don't know.
[01:11:52.944 --> 01:12:01.351]  And what happens to innocent people in wartime in his suicidal, drug-filled mind equates with death threat.
[01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:04.914]  So this is absolutely ridiculous and appalling.
[01:12:04.934 --> 01:12:07.757]  What do you mean by suicide, drug-filled mind?
[01:12:08.237 --> 01:12:14.583]  Well, he's been in and out of rehab for numerous instances, and I didn't even know this until after we shot this video.
[01:12:14.623 --> 01:12:20.728]  Apparently, on his VH1 series, Breaking Bonaduce, which is a reality show of him just being a lunatic,
[01:12:21.444 --> 01:12:24.525]  He attempted suicide by slitting his wrists.
[01:12:27.247 --> 01:12:31.748]  There needs to be an investigation to find out if these are false charges that he's leveling.
[01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:47.415]  And we're going to play the Fox News clip where, by the way, we have another Fox News clip where they're saying that Matt Damon and all these other people who are just mildly criticizing the Iraq War and the police state in America, that we should all be put in camps.
[01:12:48.487 --> 01:12:51.268]  Laura Ingraham has said, I'm American, Al Qaeda should be arrested.
[01:12:52.088 --> 01:12:54.768]  Hannity has said similar things, by name.
[01:12:55.228 --> 01:13:00.029]  Now they're just saying, all of us, or anybody that criticizes, and it's because we're kicking their hind ends.
[01:13:00.069 --> 01:13:01.530]  We're going to defend this republic.
[01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:05.490]  We're going to defeat the New World Order, and we're going to do it with your help, America.
[01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:08.851]  So please don't stand behind us, stand right beside us.
[01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:14.072]  Here you are talking, oh, by the way, I notice the tape kind of ends abruptly.
[01:13:14.887 --> 01:13:17.509]  With him cussing at you, how did all this end?
[01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:20.231]  I asked him another question after that.
[01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:24.735]  I said, so do you actually think that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?
[01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.397]  And I said, you don't think that that was a complete fabrication?
[01:13:28.157 --> 01:13:32.220]  And then he went on to say that his brother was in Iraq and got shot.
[01:13:32.901 --> 01:13:35.883]  And he asked me if I still wanted to mess with him about this.
[01:13:36.143 --> 01:13:37.084]  I felt really bad.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.742]  And I didn't, I knew this story was going to get hot.
[01:13:40.143 --> 01:13:46.109]  And I didn't want the story to be focused on a quote, celebrity family member was shot in Iraq.
[01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.471]  And I figured that's a very personal private matter.
[01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:51.654]  I figured that him and his family didn't want that kind of attention.
[01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:52.755]  Have you looked into that though?
[01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:54.157]  Is that even true?
[01:13:54.617 --> 01:13:56.139]  I have in his emails.
[01:13:56.219 --> 01:14:01.424]  And when I spoke with him on the phone, he called me and we, we addressed some of these issues over the phone.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:08.043]  He did say that it wasn't his brother, but rather his wife's brother, who he considers his family.
[01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:09.304]  You need to check into that, too.
[01:14:09.984 --> 01:14:16.047]  Let's go ahead and play this... Well, you're being quite friendly and respectful, and then they're calling you crazy.
[01:14:16.287 --> 01:14:18.188]  Fox News is calling us all crazy.
[01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:26.332]  We're crazy for bringing up official Operation Northwoods, Associated Press, Baltimore Sun, ABC News.
[01:14:26.532 --> 01:14:27.433]  We're crazy.
[01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:28.093]  Here it is.
[01:14:28.951 --> 01:14:30.874]  Hey Danny, can we just bother you for two seconds?
[01:14:30.894 --> 01:14:31.654]  What do you think about 9-11?
[01:14:31.995 --> 01:14:33.517]  You think it was an inside job?
[01:14:39.659 --> 01:14:42.500]  No, considering that was the source of this mess that we're in now.
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.742]  I mean, we know that there were no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:14:44.782 --> 01:14:53.228]  Now, most officials are saying that the war in Iraq was a mistake, and we're trying to get to the bottom of this so that the American people won't be fooled again.
[01:14:53.248 --> 01:14:56.470]  3,000 people have been murdered, Danny.
[01:14:56.510 --> 01:15:01.513]  So, have you heard that 9-11 was, at the bare minimum, let to happen on purpose?
[01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:06.704]  I've heard rumors from ridiculous conspiracy theory people, yes.
[01:15:07.304 --> 01:15:23.455]  So, Morgan Reynolds, former Bush cabinet official, is a conspiracy theorist, and the former German defense minister, Andre von Bülow, is a conspiracy theorist, and the former head of the Star Wars program, are all conspiracy theorists?
[01:15:24.016 --> 01:15:29.780]  If you believe that there was advanced knowledge of 9-11 and we didn't get civilians out, and that is their opinion, yes, that is what I believe.
[01:15:30.956 --> 01:15:39.300]  Did you know that there's a declassified document in the National Archives where our government put plans to paper to commit terrorism in this country and blame it on another country?
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.761]  Dude, what is that?
[01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:45.823]  I'm sorry, what is your name?
[01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:48.485]  Can you log my name for just one moment?
[01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:54.069]  Who the f*** are you to come up to me on the street and criticize my government?
[01:15:54.369 --> 01:15:56.010]  I voted for President Bush.
[01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:58.551]  I believe in what we're doing in the Middle East.
[01:15:58.911 --> 01:15:59.972]  I don't f***ing know you.
[01:15:59.992 --> 01:16:01.693]  I don't want to know you.
[01:16:01.713 --> 01:16:03.774]  I don't give a f*** about your opinions.
[01:16:04.274 --> 01:16:07.976]  We're losing the hearts and minds around the world and you want to help make us the enemy?
[01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:08.816]  F*** off!
[01:16:10.882 --> 01:16:13.724]  Well, my name is John Connor from the Resistance Manifesto.
[01:16:13.764 --> 01:16:15.145]  I wish I had a book for you.
[01:16:15.345 --> 01:16:27.073]  I would kindly give it to you, sir, so you could be enlightened to the truth that President Bush is a lying criminal, member of Skull and Bones, and the Bohemian Grove, where they do mock human sacrifices every year.
[01:16:27.393 --> 01:16:31.816]  He's also the President of the United States of America, you disrespectful little...
[01:16:33.653 --> 01:16:38.658]  I do believe that we have a First Amendment here, which is the freedom of speech.
[01:16:38.858 --> 01:16:41.601]  Did I say you shouldn't say it, or did I just say you're disrespectful?
[01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:43.262]  I agree with you we have freedom of speech.
[01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:50.729]  Feel free to make fun of the president of your country where you're free to do this little bull**** thing you're doing that counts for no one.
[01:16:50.989 --> 01:16:54.352]  You're just trying to make yourself feel important by walking up and down the street with a microphone.
[01:16:54.633 --> 01:16:59.197]  You're nobody, you're not going to amount to anything, but you get this chance because you live in a free country.
[01:17:00.842 --> 01:17:05.203]  Well, uh, I know we haven't spoken from a true Hollywood celebrity.
[01:17:07.604 --> 01:17:10.645]  That's right, we don't count, only the elite scumbags count.
[01:17:10.765 --> 01:17:15.146]  So, this is, this is how they roll, this is, this is how they operate.
[01:17:15.166 --> 01:17:23.788]  But you notice, John's saying it's a total inside job, but Monoduchi doesn't even believe that the government ever had prior knowledge, which is totally now admitted.
[01:17:23.868 --> 01:17:24.168]  John?
[01:17:24.889 --> 01:17:29.490]  Now, when he and myself were on John Gibson's Fox Radio show, John Gibson asked him,
[01:17:29.986 --> 01:17:35.507]  How he felt about one-third of the American people believing that 9-11 was an inside job, and he was utterly shocked.
[01:17:35.687 --> 01:17:38.328]  He said that he found that hard to believe.
[01:17:38.348 --> 01:17:46.210]  That was a Scripps Howard News Service Ohio poll, and of course the other numbers are 84% don't believe the official story, believe they're being lied to.
[01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:54.172]  And we have a slight clip of him on that show making these claims that he has received numerous death threats through his MySpace page.
[01:17:54.665 --> 01:18:01.867]  And then he contradicts himself because he says that the FBI called him and wanted to turn over the names of the people who were quote, threatening his life.
[01:18:02.227 --> 01:18:05.908]  And he said he didn't want to cooperate with them because he believes in freedom of speech.
[01:18:06.228 --> 01:18:13.850]  But then later on in the end of the interview, he goes on to say that if anybody does threaten his life, he will turn it over to the FBI.
[01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:15.390]  So I'm very confused.
[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:18.171]  This could be a COINTELPRO op.
[01:18:18.513 --> 01:18:24.374]  The FBI contacting him or him contacting the FBI, they knew that this story was going to get hot.
[01:18:24.694 --> 01:18:33.116]  And by mentioning that he was receiving threats and that the FBI is involved, it smears not only me, but the entire 9-11 truth movement.
[01:18:33.356 --> 01:18:35.277]  And that makes me very aggravated.
[01:18:35.857 --> 01:18:43.839]  Well, overall, this is a good thing because it draws more attention to 9-11 truth for the dumbed-down masses that only care about
[01:18:45.163 --> 01:18:46.264]  These reality shows.
[01:18:46.344 --> 01:18:50.346]  So it's a big score for the truth.
[01:18:50.386 --> 01:18:51.887]  Good job, John Connor.
[01:18:51.907 --> 01:18:52.427]  We'll be back.
[01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:56.530]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:58.931]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:00.092 --> 01:19:04.914]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:05.134 --> 01:19:07.856]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:07.916 --> 01:19:09.037]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:19:10.357 --> 01:19:14.920]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:19:15.871 --> 01:19:23.135]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:27.198]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:19:27.438 --> 01:19:32.801]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:19:53.378 --> 01:19:56.940]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:57.501]  are located?
[01:19:57.701 --> 01:20:01.083]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:20:58.873 --> 01:21:04.018]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:05.006 --> 01:21:09.108]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:09.548 --> 01:21:18.211]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.

[01:21:36.162 --> 01:21:37.583]  It's absolutely free.
[01:21:37.703 --> 01:21:39.904]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:39.944 --> 01:21:40.525]  Just call right now.
[01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:54.830]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:55.691]  What's wrong?
[01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:56.992]  I am so tired.
[01:21:57.052 --> 01:21:59.533]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:21:59.653 --> 01:22:00.734]  I have tried everything.
[01:22:00.814 --> 01:22:02.555]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:22:02.715 --> 01:22:03.856]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:22:03.996 --> 01:22:06.298]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:08.019]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:10.301]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:22:10.401 --> 01:22:12.642]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:12.822 --> 01:22:13.343]  The what?

[01:22:47.435 --> 01:22:50.716]  That's Bed F A N dot com.
[01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:56.533]  Uh-huh.
[01:23:34.771 --> 01:23:35.351]  Welcome back.
[01:23:37.572 --> 01:23:38.512]  John Connor is our guest.
[01:23:38.532 --> 01:23:41.652]  He'll be with us until about 40 after.
[01:23:41.672 --> 01:23:46.853]  And then we're going to go to your calls from there until the bottom of the next hour.
[01:23:46.933 --> 01:23:49.954]  We have another great guest coming on, the producer of The Scanner Darkly.
[01:23:50.014 --> 01:23:52.754]  I've got a bunch of other world news that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:23:52.855 --> 01:23:55.335]  I will at least graze over the surface.
[01:23:56.075 --> 01:24:14.662]  There's just so much here, but the reason we're covering this with all the other world news and the dollar and incredible inflation and just everything that's going on is because it's an illustration of how the other side doesn't have anything but blusters and claiming they're being threatened and we're all bad.
[01:24:15.863 --> 01:24:19.604]  John, I want to get to this Fox Radio clip with John Gibson.
[01:24:21.371 --> 01:24:29.235]  I'm trying to demonize 9-11 truth, but do you want to comment about some of the charges that Bonaduce makes?
[01:24:29.255 --> 01:24:34.598]  ...that his entire family, including his 12-year-old daughter, uses his MySpace page.
[01:24:35.218 --> 01:24:37.960]  First of all, a 12-year-old isn't supposed to use MySpace.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.521]  The terms of service are a minimum of 14 years old.
[01:24:40.882 --> 01:24:49.446]  And what in the world is his daughter doing using the, quote, official Danny Bonaduce MySpace page for his fans?
[01:24:49.506 --> 01:24:50.947]  That's completely ridiculous.
[01:24:51.388 --> 01:25:02.476]  I would imagine that half of his emails are from fellow drug addicts and alcoholics wishing him a happy sobriety and exchanging their stories of their alcohol and drug abuse.
[01:25:02.596 --> 01:25:10.662]  So it just blows my mind that not only he lets his 12-year-old daughter use MySpace in general, but use his MySpace
[01:25:11.181 --> 01:25:19.669]  And apparently he interprets pictures of collateral damage and links to films like Terror Storm as, quote, death threats.
[01:25:19.769 --> 01:25:20.290]  That's right.
[01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:28.237]  You went and looked at the stuff on the page, John, and then you talked to him and he was relaying to you what the threats were.
[01:25:28.577 --> 01:25:30.999]  How is a link to Terror Storm terrorism?
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:36.865]  I'm not sure, and I asked him to send me copies of the emails, send me the usernames,
[01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:38.190]  He said that he would.
[01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:39.611]  I have not received those yet.
[01:25:39.891 --> 01:25:44.914]  And then in this interview, this clip that we're going to play... But wait, first he claimed the threats were on the MySpace.
[01:25:44.954 --> 01:25:45.994]  Where's the beef?
[01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:46.735]  Where's the proof?
[01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.335]  I haven't seen it.
[01:25:48.636 --> 01:25:53.478]  And then he contradicts himself again, saying that if he did get threats, he would call the FBI.
[01:25:53.498 --> 01:25:57.120]  But then he said that earlier he wouldn't turn over the threats.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.580]  This is completely ridiculous.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:03.443]  Then he says in the interview that he received 20 people were sending him death threats.
[01:26:03.483 --> 01:26:05.824]  I think what he means is 20 people were posting
[01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.937]  9-11 Truth on his MySpace page.
[01:26:08.977 --> 01:26:19.162]  So this man, I think his brain is soaking in alcohol and drugs, and he has lost his grip on reality like most celebrities, especially child stars, have done.
[01:26:19.182 --> 01:26:26.626]  Well, see, I don't really know who this guy is, just that I hear him all over Neocon Talk Radio worshipping the whole agenda.
[01:26:27.346 --> 01:26:28.247]  Who is this guy?
[01:26:28.925 --> 01:26:43.432]  He was a former child star from the Partridge family who has done little bits and pieces in very, very small TV shows and movies throughout the last 20 or 30 years and is still most known for being a 10-year-old child
[01:26:44.217 --> 01:26:46.319]  on the 1970s television show.
[01:26:46.339 --> 01:26:51.443]  Let's go ahead and start playing this clip, and we'll come back and play the rest of it and let you respond to it.
[01:26:51.463 --> 01:26:53.065]  Then we'll go to your calls and cover news, folks.
[01:26:53.325 --> 01:27:00.671]  We appreciate John Connor joining us today, and we appreciate him going and talking to this twit on the side of the street and enduring all this demonization.
[01:27:01.172 --> 01:27:05.335]  But it's overall for a good cause to get 9-11 truth out to the general public.
[01:27:06.016 --> 01:27:10.599]  Here it is with Gibson, who looks like Count Dracula, a Count Dracula albino.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.000]  Here it is.
[01:27:11.846 --> 01:27:13.348]  Danny Bonaducci joins me now.
[01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:20.514]  Danny, thanks for coming on and thanks for telling that little bleep to where he can shove it, bleep.
[01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:23.878]  First of all, thank you for having me and I gotta tell you something, I am...
[01:27:25.024 --> 01:27:37.753]  The most informed person on psychopaths today, if you'd have called me on Friday, the day that hit YouTube, I'd have said, uh, I'd have said, he's a certifiable lunatic and they should lock him away.
[01:27:38.313 --> 01:27:48.640]  But then the tape hit YouTube and the certifiable lunatics came out and completely eclipsed him compared to the people who follow him.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:51.242]  He's, I'd like to have him as my next door neighbor.
[01:27:51.622 --> 01:27:55.330]  But I'm not particularly politically inclined.
[01:27:55.851 --> 01:28:03.566]  This guy and his nut job followers made me a political person overnight and I didn't ask for the job!
[01:28:04.122 --> 01:28:07.645]  Well, yeah, by the way, I just realized we've never even been formally introduced.
[01:28:07.726 --> 01:28:09.067]  Hi Danny, I'm John Gibson.
[01:28:09.667 --> 01:28:16.154]  Well, I mean, I know who you are, but I'm almost at a level 8 on my scale, and 10 is just spooky.
[01:28:16.854 --> 01:28:29.086]  And you need to know that this little tape on YouTube took on a life of its own and got so... I've been contacted by the FBI... Let me write it back.
[01:28:29.918 --> 01:28:37.384]  We'll stop it right there with him being contacted by the FBI and the story changing a couple times, and we'll finish up with John Connors.
[01:28:37.404 --> 01:28:37.885]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.529 --> 01:28:44.430]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:46.532]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.453 --> 01:28:50.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.163 --> 01:28:57.945]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:28:58.165 --> 01:29:02.146]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:29:02.406 --> 01:29:08.708]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:57.296]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:29:57.536 --> 01:30:01.099]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:01.359 --> 01:30:05.441]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:05.721 --> 01:30:06.662]  I was so amazed.
[01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:09.763]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:30:09.924 --> 01:30:11.805]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:12.185 --> 01:30:17.388]  Saltlywellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:30:17.868 --> 01:30:23.771]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:25.772]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:30:26.012 --> 01:30:29.214]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:30:29.394 --> 01:30:33.296]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:30:33.536 --> 01:30:35.057]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:30:35.377 --> 01:30:40.040]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:46.743]  That's SOLAYWellness.com or call 312-224-2710.
[01:30:46.763 --> 01:30:47.543]  312-224-2710.
[01:30:47.963 --> 01:30:58.688]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:30:59.849 --> 01:31:04.671]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:07.632]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:31:07.652 --> 01:31:08.733]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:14.714]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:31:15.635 --> 01:31:22.900]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:26.963]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:32.566]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:31:33.547 --> 01:31:34.828]  Call for your copy today.
[01:31:34.848 --> 01:31:35.048]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:31:38.328 --> 01:31:44.153]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:31:44.873 --> 01:31:45.274]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:31:45.294 --> 01:31:45.514]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:45.534 --> 01:31:45.754]  First off,
[01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:15.921]  Bonaduce, Danny Bonaduce claims that he's not political.
[01:32:15.981 --> 01:32:22.385]  He's a pro-war, pro-New World Order little creature who I, again, hear all over talk radio.
[01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:24.106]  Glenn Beck, you name it.
[01:32:25.146 --> 01:32:26.227]  Pushing all of this.
[01:32:26.427 --> 01:32:27.928]  So, number one, that's not true.
[01:32:29.671 --> 01:32:33.774]  And he talks about how crazy and whacked out and wild John Connor is.
[01:32:34.334 --> 01:32:38.457]  John Connor was calmly talking to him and talking about information that's mainstream news.
[01:32:39.958 --> 01:32:42.941]  Let's go back to the clip where he says the FBI contacted him.
[01:32:42.981 --> 01:32:43.321]  Here it is.
[01:32:44.105 --> 01:32:49.069]  But I'm almost at a level 8 on my scale, and 10 is just spooky.
[01:32:49.770 --> 01:33:04.963]  And you need to know that this little tape on YouTube took on a life of its own, and got so... I've been contacted by the FBI, because they wanted me to give them all the names of the people who threatened my life.
[01:33:05.823 --> 01:33:06.344]  I said no!
[01:33:07.472 --> 01:33:08.213]  I said, you know what?
[01:33:08.313 --> 01:33:08.833]  I've got to.
[01:33:08.853 --> 01:33:12.476]  I'm going to write them all back and say, don't threaten my life because I'm a real, live American.
[01:33:12.656 --> 01:33:15.058]  I'll fight for your right to be stupid.
[01:33:15.459 --> 01:33:16.580]  Just here's what you need to know.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:26.768]  And that's what I want to make clear, that John Connor, comparatively speaking, I literally went online to these people who threatened my life for standing up for my country.
[01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:30.593]  And I wrote them back because I'm on MySpace.
[01:33:30.893 --> 01:33:32.634]  I said, this is not my personal thing.
[01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:40.120]  This is a MySpace that involves my wife's dress company, my fan mail, and my 12-year-old and her anime friends.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.441]  You're writing to the computer of a 12-year-old.
[01:33:43.673 --> 01:33:48.135]  Two or three people out of the 20 with the death threats stopped writing or even apologized.
[01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:52.496]  There's one guy, he actually wrote back, sorry I didn't know, and I couldn't believe it.
[01:33:52.536 --> 01:33:54.257]  I wrote him back and told him I was proud of him.
[01:33:54.837 --> 01:34:02.119]  But some of these nutjobs actually readdressed their death threats to my child so she would get them directly.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:08.481]  She opened up my space thing with an anime picture of it and it was a picture of a child on fire.
[01:34:13.506 --> 01:34:19.888]  What do you think about the fact that some huge percentage of Americans, upwards of 30%, actually believe this stuff?
[01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:23.209]  I had no idea that as many as 30% believe.
[01:34:23.389 --> 01:34:25.050]  Now, what is it you're saying that they believe?
[01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:26.310]  Because I would find that hard to believe.
[01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:31.952]  That's one-third of Americans are saying, believe that the American government bombed the World Trade Center?
[01:34:32.745 --> 01:34:33.045]  Yeah.
[01:34:34.106 --> 01:34:36.287]  Uh, that, that frightened me.
[01:34:37.288 --> 01:34:38.669]  It wouldn't have frightened me Friday.
[01:34:39.129 --> 01:34:40.750]  It would not have frightened me Friday.
[01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:50.716]  It frightened me today because the mail I got was so vicious and so mean and when I told them you're writing to a 12 year old, they didn't care.
[01:34:50.976 --> 01:34:54.178]  Then, out of nowhere, the FBI called me.
[01:34:55.163 --> 01:35:00.865]  Because this YouTube tape of me... Essentially, as far as I'm concerned, I'm eating lunch and the moment is over.
[01:35:01.245 --> 01:35:11.309]  And I gotta tell you, uh, uh, this guy, comparatively speaking, John Connor, in my opinion, may be crazy, I don't know, but he is, at least in form... Wait a minute.
[01:35:11.569 --> 01:35:13.130]  They contact him about the YouTube?
[01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:15.031]  There's no threats on the YouTube?
[01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:17.492]  And then he's not political?
[01:35:18.072 --> 01:35:20.473]  And then there's death threats on the...
[01:35:21.534 --> 01:35:22.135]  MySpace?
[01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:29.560]  But you went there, John, and all you saw was links to TerrorStorm, and he starts whining, I guess, about, hey, my kids are on this page when it's his personal page.
[01:35:29.861 --> 01:35:33.023]  So I guess people send pictures of Iraqi children going, look at what's happening.
[01:35:33.363 --> 01:35:37.386]  I guess he probably then construed that into more threats.
[01:35:38.167 --> 01:35:40.008]  And then Gibson's running with this.
[01:35:40.028 --> 01:35:43.831]  This is how they counter 9-11 truth, never with debating the facts.
[01:35:43.891 --> 01:35:51.137]  It's always, we're crazy, we're evil, we need to go to FEMA camps, we're terrorists, we're American Al Qaeda, we should all be arrested.
[01:35:51.952 --> 01:35:54.292]  I mean, that's what O'Reilly and others have said.
[01:35:55.513 --> 01:35:56.993]  John, where is he going with this?
[01:35:58.013 --> 01:36:01.694]  I, again, refer back to his years of alcohol or drug abuse.
[01:36:01.994 --> 01:36:05.294]  I don't think the man has a rational thought coming out of his mouth.
[01:36:05.775 --> 01:36:09.675]  When I spoke with him on the phone, it was very, very difficult.
[01:36:09.775 --> 01:36:12.096]  He did not want to listen to me whatsoever.
[01:36:12.176 --> 01:36:19.417]  I kept trying to educate him, telling him that I'm not a liberal, this isn't a liberal issue, tried to suggest some of the evidence, and he kept cutting me off.
[01:36:19.878 --> 01:36:22.799]  I don't care what you have to F and say.
[01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:27.620]  I just want to make sure that your dogs aren't going to come and mess with my family.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.582]  And again, he said that the FBI contacted him because there's a video of him on YouTube.
[01:36:33.182 --> 01:36:34.603]  I am very confused.
[01:36:34.703 --> 01:36:36.083]  I emailed him again and I asked him,
[01:36:36.559 --> 01:36:45.406]  What exactly the FBI said to him, why they were contacting him, if this was allegedly, before the alleged threats that he was getting.
[01:36:45.446 --> 01:36:46.346]  Yeah, there are threats.
[01:36:46.447 --> 01:36:53.692]  It's probably some FBI or some FBI mole doing it, and they are contacting him to try to create some publicity.
[01:36:53.992 --> 01:36:55.954]  It's probably all being run by Fox News.
[01:36:56.334 --> 01:37:00.197]  I mean, Viet Dinh is on the board of directors, ladies and gentlemen, of Fox News.
[01:37:00.237 --> 01:37:01.298]  They are in operation.
[01:37:01.778 --> 01:37:11.980]  Yeah, this reeks of COINTELPRO, and it's the perfect opportunity, unfortunately, for the mainstream media to not only demonize the 9-11 Truth Movement, but to paint us like we're a bunch of dangerous... Who knows?
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:19.422]  You know, he may really have been threatened, but you saw TerrorStorm links, or did he say these evil TerrorStorm links to the film TerrorStorm?
[01:37:19.602 --> 01:37:23.683]  I saw links to various 9-11 Truth videos, TerrorStorm included.
[01:37:23.843 --> 01:37:26.943]  I saw a picture of some collateral damage on his webpage.
[01:37:26.983 --> 01:37:30.244]  I saw pictures of Building 7 collapsing in questions.
[01:37:30.852 --> 01:37:42.764]  The only thing that I saw on his page was a personal insult to him, and apparently if somebody insulting him in his own mind gets twisted into a death threat through his delusional view.
[01:37:42.964 --> 01:37:45.587]  Let's finish up the clip and we're going to let you get back to work, John.
[01:37:45.627 --> 01:37:47.028]  Here it is.
[01:37:47.268 --> 01:37:50.692]  Then, out of nowhere, the FBI called me.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:57.164]  Because this YouTube tape of me... Essentially, as far as I'm concerned, I'm eating lunch and the moment is over.
[01:37:57.545 --> 01:38:10.535]  And I gotta tell you, this guy, comparatively speaking, John Connor, in my opinion, may be crazy, I don't know, but he is at least informed and writes a reasonable email, compared to some of these other nuts.
[01:38:10.955 --> 01:38:14.338]  And I want to make something perfectly clear to the nuts that are going to write me right after this.
[01:38:14.778 --> 01:38:16.940]  The FBI gave me a beautiful tip.
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.341]  A beautiful tip.
[01:38:19.353 --> 01:38:25.079]  Because I think they were surprised that I didn't hand over all the names of the people who had emailed me.
[01:38:25.119 --> 01:38:30.405]  And I said, I can't be a proud American and stifle somebody's right to free speech.
[01:38:30.445 --> 01:38:32.747]  I can't be winning this fight by cheating.
[01:38:33.328 --> 01:38:34.409]  So I can't do that right now.
[01:38:34.449 --> 01:38:37.372]  But anybody who threatens me, I will certainly turn over their guts.
[01:38:37.772 --> 01:38:39.414]  Your freedom of speech doesn't come into my house.
[01:38:40.735 --> 01:38:41.355]  Stop right there.
[01:38:41.435 --> 01:38:47.197]  So this is... So he says that he wouldn't turn people over unless they threatened him.
[01:38:47.677 --> 01:38:51.058]  So I guess there he's saying he wasn't really threatened.
[01:38:51.138 --> 01:38:53.979]  I mean, this guy's contradicting himself every other sentence, John.
[01:38:54.479 --> 01:38:58.681]  Yeah, he was so irrational when I spoke with him on the phone, I couldn't even get an answer out of the man.
[01:38:58.861 --> 01:39:03.162]  I felt like he was intoxicated when he was yelling at me and swearing at me on the phone.
[01:39:03.877 --> 01:39:11.487]  Uh, and again, for the FBI to contact him out of the blue just blows my mind, unless they knew that this was going to be hot.
[01:39:12.047 --> 01:39:14.290]  And again, this just shows the celebrity fixation.
[01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:35.167]  Public officials, military officials coming forward and making allegations, and it just gets brushed over, but a washed-up child star all of a sudden makes insults towards the 9-11 Truth Movement, and he's all over Fox News, he's all over the web, this very, very, very fishy of COINTELPRO.
[01:39:36.733 --> 01:39:38.474]  And he's probably being manipulated.
[01:39:38.494 --> 01:39:43.018]  I don't think the guy's got his head screwed on straight enough to even be staging this.
[01:39:43.218 --> 01:39:52.485]  Now I posted emails that he sent me and that I sent him on my site so anybody can just go through and read those and I asked him if I could come on as a guest.
[01:39:52.904 --> 01:39:58.347]  He was apparently going to host Glenn Beck's show, and I asked him, I said, can I come on as a guest and talk about these issues?
[01:39:58.427 --> 01:40:04.570]  And he said he would consider it, but then he said he had another work obligation that may supersede it, so I hope that he calls me again.
[01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:07.471]  That's right, he's such a neocon, he's co-hosting Glenn Beck's show.
[01:40:07.511 --> 01:40:08.432]  Let's finish up the clip.
[01:40:08.692 --> 01:40:09.032]  Here it is.
[01:40:10.499 --> 01:40:14.561]  So I can't do that right now, but anybody who threatens me, I will certainly turn over their guts.
[01:40:14.942 --> 01:40:17.903]  Your freedom of speech doesn't come into my house with a threat with my kid.
[01:40:18.363 --> 01:40:20.004]  And the FBI gave me a great tip.
[01:40:20.584 --> 01:40:29.689]  They said, put all your computers, the second business opens tomorrow, take all your computers through your server company or whatever it is, and put them all in your kid's name.
[01:40:29.869 --> 01:40:30.549]  And I said, why?
[01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:34.231]  And they said, because you can't write anything to a 12-year-old.
[01:40:34.251 --> 01:40:38.193]  They said, if they write, and it's even addressed to you,
[01:40:39.329 --> 01:40:41.131]  And you open it, and it's dirty language?
[01:40:41.231 --> 01:40:42.432]  It's a picture you don't like?
[01:40:42.653 --> 01:40:45.356]  They said, even if it just says hi, how are you going?
[01:40:45.656 --> 01:40:50.181]  If it comes to the computer of a minor, and you report it to us, we have to investigate.
[01:40:50.441 --> 01:40:52.103]  So write me again tonight, you freaks!
[01:40:52.683 --> 01:40:54.726]  And the FBI will be on your door tomorrow.
[01:40:55.902 --> 01:40:57.343]  Okay, so let's just stop right there.
[01:40:57.443 --> 01:41:04.108]  First he says that he was threatened, but then he said if he was threatened he'd tell the FBI, but then he wasn't, so he isn't handing it over.
[01:41:04.429 --> 01:41:13.596]  But now, so he can get everybody, he's moved the servers over into his daughter's name, which is using a child to troll for things without people even knowing.
[01:41:14.036 --> 01:41:16.198]  I don't think you can put servers in a child's name.
[01:41:16.218 --> 01:41:19.120]  I don't even think the FBI would really tell him that.
[01:41:19.841 --> 01:41:30.030]  And so we've got some type of entrapment here, where if anybody writes to him, even if it's just saying, Hi, Mr. Bonaduce, then we'll claim it was to a child.
[01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:35.114]  I mean, this is him talking about attempted frame-ups on national radio now?
[01:41:35.134 --> 01:41:35.835]  I mean, this is getting
[01:41:36.195 --> 01:41:44.597]  Crazier and crazier by the minute, the more I look at this story, it just... and the reason we're covering this, folks, is that we're looking at manipulation.
[01:41:44.637 --> 01:41:45.577]  We're looking at control.
[01:41:45.597 --> 01:41:47.037]  We're looking at the tricks they play.
[01:41:47.317 --> 01:41:50.578]  We're studying, with this as a case point example, what they're doing.
[01:41:50.958 --> 01:41:52.819]  Okay, that's why we're here talking about this today.
[01:41:52.859 --> 01:41:53.119]  John?
[01:41:53.939 --> 01:42:03.401]  Now, I've gotten plenty of emails from the right-wing saying, if I was Danny Bonaduce, I would have kicked your butt and this and that, and I'm sure he probably got a few emails from people saying,
[01:42:03.891 --> 01:42:06.516]  You know, if you would have spoken to me, I would have done this.
[01:42:06.937 --> 01:42:11.044]  But you're not running around wringing your hands like... I mean, there was a website
[01:42:15.871 --> 01:42:18.852]  Saying, I want to hire someone to kill Alex Jones.
[01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:20.633]  Contact me at this private address.
[01:42:21.073 --> 01:42:22.814]  And I did say, I'm not going to put up with that.
[01:42:23.294 --> 01:42:26.516]  And the FBI did call me and I turned over the info and I talked about it on air.
[01:42:26.836 --> 01:42:31.178]  I mean, if you're going to claim you're getting threatened, you better then deliver the goods.
[01:42:31.458 --> 01:42:36.220]  And I delivered the goods and we told everybody on the web where the threat was and everybody could see it.
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.641]  But not with Bonaduce.
[01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:40.531]  No, I have yet to get the emails.
[01:42:40.591 --> 01:42:42.072]  And again, he contradicts himself there.
[01:42:42.112 --> 01:42:43.093]  He says he got threats.
[01:42:43.153 --> 01:42:44.054]  Now he says he didn't.
[01:42:44.234 --> 01:42:45.675]  If he did, he was going to turn them over.
[01:42:45.735 --> 01:42:47.276]  He said he got 20 death threats.
[01:42:48.156 --> 01:42:50.378]  I don't know what this man is talking about.
[01:42:50.878 --> 01:42:56.241]  I just wonder if the O'Reilly with Kevin Barrett yesterday is a setup for O'Reilly to address this.
[01:42:56.742 --> 01:43:00.204]  All of a sudden they have Kevin Barrett on again asking him what this has done for his life.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.961]  And the basic message is, you're not a professor, ha ha ha.
[01:43:05.321 --> 01:43:10.282]  And you know, Riley says, I don't want to debate the issues with you, let's just talk about how you're a kook.
[01:43:10.662 --> 01:43:13.123]  All they've got is sophomore names and terms.
[01:43:13.163 --> 01:43:15.564]  It's like when I was on Lars Larson last night.
[01:43:16.064 --> 01:43:19.424]  He just basically said, so what if foreign companies take over the roads?
[01:43:19.544 --> 01:43:21.205]  I'm a liberal because I don't want them to.
[01:43:21.445 --> 01:43:24.966]  When it's admitted, they've just paid off the politicians to hand it over to them.
[01:43:25.146 --> 01:43:30.207]  When John Gibson opened up with the segment, he said that if anybody believes even a fraction
[01:43:30.712 --> 01:43:36.617]  Of what the 9-11 Truth Movement people are saying, that you belong in a mental institution.
[01:43:36.717 --> 01:43:38.538]  So see, now they're in panic mode.
[01:43:38.598 --> 01:43:40.760]  Now it's O'Reilly saying you should be arrested.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.082]  It's Ingram saying it.
[01:43:43.502 --> 01:43:46.385]  Now it's open discussion of how we're all insane.
[01:43:46.445 --> 01:43:47.345]  We're violent.
[01:43:48.506 --> 01:43:50.348]  We're hurting 12-year-old children.
[01:43:50.368 --> 01:43:52.870]  I mean, we must be really hurting them bad.
[01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:53.530]  Well, we know we are.
[01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:54.251]  Look at the poll numbers.
[01:43:54.731 --> 01:43:56.513]  Yeah, they keep saying upwards of 30.
[01:43:57.134 --> 01:44:01.778]  It's 36% believe total inside job, 84% believe they're being lied to.
[01:44:01.978 --> 01:44:10.286]  So apparently one-third of the American people need to be committed in a mental institution and he said that they were certifiably insane.
[01:44:12.809 --> 01:44:13.369]  It's amazing.
[01:44:13.409 --> 01:44:14.510]  I'm not going to play the rest of the clip.
[01:44:14.551 --> 01:44:16.112]  Folks, you can go up to InfoWars.com.
[01:44:16.152 --> 01:44:17.914]  We have links over to Conor's site where you can
[01:44:18.727 --> 01:44:20.729]  Check that out at www.TheResistanceManifesto.com.
[01:44:21.190 --> 01:44:23.692]  John, what is next in your bag of tricks?
[01:44:23.712 --> 01:44:25.654]  I mean, were you just out there walking around in L.A.
[01:44:25.714 --> 01:44:27.556]  and came across this creature?
[01:44:28.196 --> 01:44:38.466]  We actually were doing a video just on the lack of morals in Hollywood and the sewage that spills from Hollywood into the living rooms of Americans across the country.
[01:44:38.886 --> 01:44:44.590]  And we just so happened to bump into Mr. Bonaducci.
[01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:53.237]  And again, I emailed him and I said, hey, so I guess that little BS interview that counts for no one, I guess you couldn't have been more wrong about that.
[01:44:53.357 --> 01:44:56.299]  So hopefully Mr. Bonaducci will learn to bite his tongue.
[01:44:56.856 --> 01:45:00.879]  And he doesn't know who he's talking to or what he's getting himself into here.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.242]  Online media people think that was the attitude.
[01:45:04.262 --> 01:45:08.345]  I remember 10 years ago, 12 years ago, talking to a reporter for a paper.
[01:45:08.685 --> 01:45:11.448]  These people were on unbelievable power trips.
[01:45:11.828 --> 01:45:14.090]  They don't have their monopoly of media anymore.
[01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:16.391]  You see, we don't want a monopoly.
[01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:17.552]  You guys want a monopoly.
[01:45:17.813 --> 01:45:19.214]  We know the truth sells.
[01:45:19.554 --> 01:45:24.578]  We want to be on an open playing field to beat you to pieces.
[01:45:25.098 --> 01:45:26.921]  Okay, we're going to win.
[01:45:26.962 --> 01:45:28.404]  We're going to ace you.
[01:45:28.644 --> 01:45:29.366]  We're coming.
[01:45:29.626 --> 01:45:30.908]  You cannot stop us.
[01:45:30.928 --> 01:45:34.234]  This zombie never even heard of YouTube and in the last...
[01:45:35.218 --> 01:45:40.822]  This video has gotten 130,000 views and it's still skyrocketing every day.
[01:45:41.183 --> 01:45:55.193]  It's one of the most popular videos of the week on YouTube and this individual says that nobody cares about the interview, that I'm a nobody, and he wasn't even informed and he was shocked that one-third of the people agree with what I was saying to him.
[01:45:56.184 --> 01:45:57.985]  Well, you're not a nobody, John Connor.
[01:45:58.005 --> 01:45:58.846]  You've taken action.
[01:45:58.866 --> 01:46:05.790]  You've woken up a lot of people, and folks should learn from the tricks you use to get attention to 9-11 Truth and the New World Order.
[01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:06.851]  I salute you.
[01:46:06.871 --> 01:46:07.331]  Take care.
[01:46:07.451 --> 01:46:10.814]  Thanks for coming on with us, and we'll be talking to you in the future.
[01:46:10.994 --> 01:46:12.095]  You got to keep up the fight.
[01:46:12.395 --> 01:46:12.895]  Take care.
[01:46:13.315 --> 01:46:14.456]  All right, we're going to go to your calls.
[01:46:14.796 --> 01:46:16.738]  I know you've been holding patiently.
[01:46:18.759 --> 01:46:21.741]  Jim and John and Lewis and Greg and Ron, we're going to get to everybody.
[01:46:21.761 --> 01:46:23.242]  I don't have a guest until the bottom of the next hour.
[01:46:24.691 --> 01:46:28.914]  But I do want to bring up Debbie Morrow for just four short minutes.
[01:46:28.974 --> 01:46:30.254]  I appreciate her coming on with us.
[01:46:30.294 --> 01:46:31.275]  New Millennium Concepts.
[01:46:31.735 --> 01:46:32.696]  Made in America.
[01:46:33.356 --> 01:46:33.857]  Pardon me, John?
[01:46:35.438 --> 01:46:37.179]  She's calling right back in with her phone dropped.
[01:46:37.259 --> 01:46:37.499]  Okay.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:39.600]  I'll just plug it.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:40.781]  I mean, we don't even need to have Debbie on.
[01:46:40.801 --> 01:46:42.162]  The point is, I use these.
[01:46:42.302 --> 01:46:43.202]  I give these as gifts.
[01:46:43.382 --> 01:46:45.063]  I've bought over ten of these in the years.
[01:46:45.824 --> 01:46:46.564]  It's well over ten.
[01:46:46.604 --> 01:46:48.225]  I mean, I've bought like five in one year.
[01:46:48.265 --> 01:46:48.726]  I know that.
[01:46:49.106 --> 01:46:49.906]  To give as gifts.
[01:46:50.287 --> 01:46:51.187]  They're very affordable.
[01:46:51.227 --> 01:46:52.368]  Gravity-fed filters.
[01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:56.130]  And they cut everything out except fluoride.
[01:46:56.170 --> 01:46:57.331]  It reduces fluoride.
[01:46:57.531 --> 01:47:01.833]  Fluoride is so small, even reverse osmosis can't get rid of it.
[01:47:02.153 --> 01:47:05.415]  But they have a special post filter that knocks that out.
[01:47:07.095 --> 01:47:09.537]  And that's only like 99.99 something.
[01:47:09.697 --> 01:47:10.697]  Some of it still gets through.
[01:47:10.737 --> 01:47:15.980]  But they have a filtration system that you can add on that will even knock that out.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:19.021]  Give Debbie Morrow a call.
[01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:23.290]  She just handles the radio interviews for New Millennium Concepts.
[01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:29.475]  They are the manufacturer of the American Berkey, which is a higher standard than even the British Berkey, which is excellent as well.
[01:47:29.755 --> 01:47:34.800]  They are the national distributor of British Berkeys, so they support patriotic broadcasting and the truth movement.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:37.322]  And you get a wholesale price.
[01:47:37.402 --> 01:47:45.249]  You try to buy their filters at the camping supply store, or at, you know, IRE or whatever, Outfitters, they're $300. $195.
[01:47:49.168 --> 01:47:52.969]  Okay, and they've got other units that it takes a few minutes to put together.
[01:47:53.469 --> 01:47:55.150]  Great for camping, great for your house.
[01:47:55.650 --> 01:47:58.151]  Stop drinking the poison that's in the water.
[01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:01.431]  Give her a call right now.
[01:48:01.451 --> 01:48:05.112]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:48:05.232 --> 01:48:08.453]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:48:08.913 --> 01:48:13.275]  Or order via the safe, secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:13.695 --> 01:48:15.875]  We give them the orders each and every day and they send them out to you.
[01:48:15.935 --> 01:48:17.256]  Or you can go to BerkeyWater.com.
[01:48:18.886 --> 01:48:24.350]  And in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special to get the special deals and you get a free gift.
[01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:33.117]  A bottle of potassium iodide in case there's a radiological event or a sheltering in place DVD or a sports bottle filter that doesn't purify.
[01:48:33.598 --> 01:48:34.278]  It reduces it.
[01:48:36.251 --> 01:48:39.613]  130 refills of swamp water, 600 plus refills of tap water.
[01:48:39.954 --> 01:48:49.799]  It reduces massively, but you can't say totally knocks it out like you can with the big units, which non-detectable levels of everything.
[01:48:49.879 --> 01:48:50.980]  It is unbelievable.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:51.660]  I use it.
[01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:53.281]  We use it right here in the office.
[01:48:53.702 --> 01:48:54.562]  You need to get it.
[01:48:54.582 --> 01:48:57.284]  1-888-803-4438 or InfoWars.com or BerkeyWater.com.
[01:49:03.007 --> 01:49:08.590]  We have a link directly on Infowars.com over to Berkeywater.com where you can get the exact same units, exact same prices.
[01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:10.771]  We just drop ship it from them.
[01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:14.853]  You can order via our secure Yahoo shopping cart if you choose to do that.
[01:49:14.914 --> 01:49:16.815]  But give Debbie a call.
[01:49:16.875 --> 01:49:21.237]  Believe me, just go read what they allow in the water at the FDA website.
[01:49:21.852 --> 01:49:23.854]  Herbicides, pesticides, heavy metals.
[01:49:24.374 --> 01:49:26.035]  The chlorine just kills the bacteria.
[01:49:26.055 --> 01:49:27.256]  You're drinking dead bacteria.
[01:49:27.717 --> 01:49:29.258]  Start purifying your water.
[01:49:29.418 --> 01:49:30.919]  It is 70% of your body.
[01:49:31.379 --> 01:49:32.100]  So important.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:37.424]  Murkywater.com, Infowars.com, 888-803-4438.
[01:49:37.484 --> 01:49:40.446]  This is an area where you can take control.
[01:49:40.506 --> 01:49:43.169]  This is a big area in your life and your health.
[01:49:43.529 --> 01:49:48.693]  And it's somewhere where you can stop the New World Order from being able to poison you.
[01:49:50.077 --> 01:49:50.637]  Call the number.
[01:49:50.898 --> 01:49:51.738]  Get a free brochure.
[01:49:51.758 --> 01:49:56.941]  It's here.
[01:49:57.141 --> 01:50:01.924]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.284 --> 01:50:09.849]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.618 --> 01:50:17.681]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.061 --> 01:50:29.486]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.806 --> 01:50:33.308]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.768 --> 01:50:35.669]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:39.871]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.509 --> 01:50:57.073]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:57.113 --> 01:50:57.613]  are located?

[01:51:30.981 --> 01:51:31.281]  I think so.
[01:51:52.987 --> 01:52:00.914]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[01:52:56.003 --> 01:52:59.905]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[01:52:59.965 --> 01:53:02.507]  Would you stand up for truth?
[01:53:02.647 --> 01:53:06.249]  Or would you turn away to leave?
[01:53:06.589 --> 01:53:11.611]  And what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:53:11.671 --> 01:53:13.733]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[01:53:14.353 --> 01:53:17.494]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[01:53:17.555 --> 01:53:21.417]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[01:53:22.097 --> 01:53:23.918]  Would you stand up for truth?
[01:53:32.294 --> 01:53:32.895]  Welcome back.
[01:53:32.915 --> 01:53:37.738]  It's hard to start this song and not play all of it.
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:40.541]  We're not going to.
[01:53:41.021 --> 01:53:42.062]  I want to get to your calls.
[01:53:42.542 --> 01:53:43.703]  We're going to take a lot of calls now.
[01:53:43.763 --> 01:53:44.584]  Toll free number 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:44.724 --> 01:53:53.970]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net.
[01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:58.654]  A lot of those sites have exclusives every day that are not on the other sites, so be sure and check them all out.
[01:53:59.272 --> 01:54:01.433]  We have that, so we have backups, redundancy.
[01:54:02.134 --> 01:54:07.897]  It's been a good, effective program against the New World Order, having multiple sites while we do it.
[01:54:09.878 --> 01:54:11.839]  My first seven films were never on DVD.
[01:54:11.879 --> 01:54:16.421]  I was too busy to re-author them and put them on DVD and make new covers and packaging and do all that.
[01:54:16.782 --> 01:54:17.422]  It's been done.
[01:54:19.043 --> 01:54:23.025]  The Police State Trilogy are together in one package, three DVDs in a box set, $34.95.
[01:54:23.085 --> 01:54:23.885]  America Destroyed by Design,
[01:54:27.904 --> 01:54:32.768]  The Masters of Terror, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed.
[01:54:33.548 --> 01:54:36.971]  They're all available now on DVD.
[01:54:37.872 --> 01:54:44.116]  Right now at www.FOWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.

[01:54:51.342 --> 01:54:52.743]  It's good to have the DVD folks.
[01:54:52.783 --> 01:54:53.043]  Get them.
[01:54:53.183 --> 01:54:53.644]  Support us.
[01:54:54.324 --> 01:54:55.485]  Let's talk to Jim in Texas.
[01:54:55.525 --> 01:54:56.326]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:54:56.366 --> 01:54:56.666]  Welcome.
[01:54:57.887 --> 01:54:58.208]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:58.248 --> 01:54:59.229]  How are you doing?
[01:54:59.690 --> 01:54:59.970]  Good.
[01:55:00.831 --> 01:55:01.613]  That's good.
[01:55:01.693 --> 01:55:06.099]  You know I like poking and playing a poker show.
[01:55:06.179 --> 01:55:08.322]  Oh, you should have told us earlier.
[01:55:08.342 --> 01:55:09.965]  I wouldn't have kept you on hold all this time.
[01:55:11.083 --> 01:55:32.370]  This is Jimmy Ritter, who has a TV show, longtime friend of mine, and helped out a lot with a lot of times with the police state, got a lot of good footage for us, and he had the Republican Party chairman on, and I talked about it, and the guys just up there denying everything, and I was talking about just how even good conservatives like you, Jimmy, just can't see how bad things have gotten.
[01:55:33.191 --> 01:55:35.611]  Well, who should I have voted for then, Alex?
[01:55:36.832 --> 01:55:40.053]  I mean, you know, we agree on a lot of things, but we should disagree on a few things.
[01:55:41.093 --> 01:55:45.638]  I understand what he said, and I also understand that even Larry Pratt will tell you he knew that that
[01:56:01.073 --> 01:56:10.763]  That's a good question and I must admit that I was hurt by that.
[01:56:10.923 --> 01:56:15.168]  I did not expect Professor when I voted for him but I did not expect him to say that either.
[01:56:16.409 --> 01:56:20.173]  Nonetheless, it still beat Senator Kerry.
[01:56:21.856 --> 01:56:22.917]  He would have been even worse.
[01:56:23.037 --> 01:56:24.278]  He would have been wonderful.
[01:56:24.538 --> 01:56:29.080]  Because then conservatives like you would be forced to wake up.
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:30.321]  We could rally the troops.
[01:56:30.621 --> 01:56:32.702]  Man, listen, you listen to Neocon Radio.
[01:56:32.782 --> 01:56:33.223]  I do too.
[01:56:33.243 --> 01:56:35.104]  I mean, like Lars Larson.
[01:56:35.444 --> 01:56:37.725]  He was there saying the North American Union is okay.
[01:56:39.662 --> 01:56:42.544]  Yeah, he's trying to compete with the Euro Union.
[01:56:42.624 --> 01:56:47.086]  As you know, the Euro dollar is more valuable than our dollar now.
[01:56:47.486 --> 01:56:58.933]  Oh, so Jimmy, you're now buying into that because, I mean, how many years, over a decade I've been saying, they're going to bring up the Euro, claim it's defeating the dollar, then bring in the Amaro, and then merge the two.
[01:56:58.973 --> 01:57:00.173]  This is a scam, Jimmy!
[01:57:00.514 --> 01:57:02.815]  Yes, it is, but how do we fight it, Alex?
[01:57:05.784 --> 01:57:13.989]  We fight it by getting involved locally and demanding people like that Republican Party chairman you had in there stop sandbagging conservatives.
[01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:15.851]  We need leaders who rally.
[01:57:16.251 --> 01:57:17.972]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:57:18.973 --> 01:57:20.994]  Jimmy, you called in.
[01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:22.375]  You obviously have something else to say.
[01:57:23.516 --> 01:57:24.056]  Anything else?
[01:57:25.257 --> 01:57:28.179]  Yeah, you know, they're coming up with the legislation this year.
[01:57:28.219 --> 01:57:28.959]  Well, just stay there.
[01:57:28.999 --> 01:57:29.479]  We got a break.
[01:57:29.499 --> 01:57:30.380]  We'll be back in one minute.
[01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:37.612]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:37.632 --> 01:57:38.153]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.193 --> 01:57:39.133]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.153 --> 01:57:40.274]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:40.294 --> 01:57:44.976]  You want answers?
[01:57:45.356 --> 01:57:48.378]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.438 --> 01:58:01.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:05.764]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.389 --> 01:58:21.114]  We're trying to get the American people to realize that there is a global crime syndicate known as the New World Order that is destroying our Republic.
[01:58:21.814 --> 01:58:24.236]  There's a lot of conservatives out there that are still in denial.
[01:58:24.256 --> 01:58:25.557]  It's like when we post a video clip
[01:58:26.497 --> 01:58:42.123]  Of Dick Cheney talking about how he kept his CFR membership secret from his constituent and then laughs, people go on the YouTube message board and post under it going, he's a real conservative, he fights the CFR, this isn't a real tape, or he's just joking!
[01:58:43.144 --> 01:58:47.165]  And it's that type of willful denial that I'm talking about.
[01:58:47.926 --> 01:58:51.387]  And now Bush has got the Democrats in office, if he would have been a strong conservative,
[01:58:53.250 --> 01:58:58.476]  He could have gotten more real conservative Republicans in, but see, and then we could have controlled the border, but he didn't want that.
[01:58:58.536 --> 01:59:03.041]  He's happy the Democrats are in because now he can get his open border.
[01:59:04.322 --> 01:59:06.965]  And it's like this on every other issue and every other subject.
[01:59:08.246 --> 01:59:09.728]  I mean, I'll tell you how we fix things, Jimmy.
[01:59:10.428 --> 01:59:19.138]  You were too nice to that Republican Party chairman of Travis County you had on when he was sitting there feeding everybody a line of baloney about how great the Republicans are.
[01:59:19.538 --> 01:59:23.503]  The Republicans, in many cases, frankly, are worse than the Democrats.
[01:59:23.603 --> 01:59:23.843]  Jimmy?
[01:59:23.863 --> 01:59:25.204]  In some cases, yeah.
[01:59:26.246 --> 01:59:30.250]  But I had to be polite and I did give people the opportunity to ask questions of him.
[01:59:31.198 --> 01:59:32.920]  Well, you did give me the opportunity.
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:42.771]  I have to be fair, you did give me an opportunity to come in and... We were short on time at that time, so we couldn't get too deep into it, but I wish you'd come out a little earlier sometimes when they have these kind of people on.
[01:59:43.532 --> 01:59:45.614]  Like the local chef, I've had him on twice.
[01:59:46.976 --> 01:59:50.460]  Yeah, but anyway, some royalty checkpoints.
[01:59:50.894 --> 01:59:53.536]  As you know, Alex, we've defeated here in Texas several times.
[01:59:53.576 --> 01:59:55.477]  Well, that's because they're running random checkpoints.
[01:59:55.517 --> 01:59:56.498]  They're not sobriety.
[01:59:56.538 --> 01:59:58.399]  If you see a drunk, you've got probable cause.
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:02.062]  And yes, the state police thought they could search vehicles without warrants.
[02:00:02.102 --> 02:00:04.664]  We sued them, and so now they're trying to pass it again.
[02:00:04.684 --> 02:00:09.327]  And all indications are it will pass if we don't do something.
[02:00:09.887 --> 02:00:16.632]  January 22nd, I will be at the state capitol with a whole bunch of other people, and I'm sure if we can get you involved in this too.
[02:00:18.163 --> 02:00:18.803]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:00:18.823 --> 02:00:21.365]  I'd love to come down there and fight checkpoints.
[02:00:21.665 --> 02:00:31.170]  And Mothers Against Drunk Driving also wants, by law, breathalyzers in all cars for everyone to have to blow.
[02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:32.891]  That's true.
[02:00:33.211 --> 02:00:43.016]  If we don't stop it somewhere, and you know, a lot of us ask about the best way to fight the New World Order, and of course my belief is to get involved in politics like we are.
[02:00:43.076 --> 02:00:47.258]  We're precinct chairs, delegates to all the conventions up to the state level,
[02:00:48.269 --> 02:00:57.156]  And at the State Capitol on January 22nd, uh, one of our old friends will be down there, a lobbyist, uh, uh, Sputnik from Texas Motorcycle Rights Association.
[02:00:57.176 --> 02:00:59.177]  Well, Jimmy, what I'll do is I should get Sputnik on.
[02:00:59.197 --> 02:01:00.838]  He's a character, but we've only got a minute left.
[02:01:00.878 --> 02:01:01.819]  He's very good.
[02:01:01.959 --> 02:01:02.900]  Let me bring something up here.
[02:01:03.536 --> 02:01:06.459]  On the eve of the Goal 4, I told you it would be a quagmire.
[02:01:06.539 --> 02:01:08.440]  By design, it would be broken in three parts.
[02:01:08.821 --> 02:01:10.282]  America would be demonized.
[02:01:10.743 --> 02:01:13.445]  Your precious Fox News overseas demonizes us.
[02:01:13.705 --> 02:01:15.507]  The domestically tries to keep us in line.
[02:01:15.807 --> 02:01:17.709]  The war is not meant to be won.
[02:01:18.029 --> 02:01:20.091]  The DU is deadly in killing our troops.
[02:01:20.411 --> 02:01:22.813]  If you support the troops, you should be for bringing them home.
[02:01:23.193 --> 02:01:24.495]  Are you for bringing them home, Jimmy?
[02:01:25.215 --> 02:01:26.536]  I only invest in it.
[02:01:26.556 --> 02:01:28.278]  You know we're going to disagree on this one.
[02:01:28.298 --> 02:01:30.520]  My boy just got back from his second tour.
[02:01:31.471 --> 02:01:42.714]  And DU can be deadly, uh, harmful, uh, but it's not quite as ha- and there's something else I'll have to help you out here with, Alex, is no troops, none of our wounded troops pay their own way home.
[02:01:43.655 --> 02:01:44.575]  They get vouchers.
[02:01:45.015 --> 02:01:47.776]  Uh, that has been in the Associated Press, Jimmy.
[02:01:47.996 --> 02:01:48.776]  They were wrong.
[02:01:49.256 --> 02:01:49.817]  Ha, ha!
[02:01:50.157 --> 02:01:51.657]  I guarantee they were wrong.
[02:01:51.677 --> 02:01:53.758]  And they don't pay for their meals either in the hospital?
[02:01:54.498 --> 02:01:54.698]  Nope.
[02:01:56.085 --> 02:01:58.847]  And, uh, and, uh, is... They get vouchers, what's called vouchers.
[02:01:59.027 --> 02:02:02.410]  If they blow their money, their voucher money, then they're on their own.
[02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:10.215]  But they get, they do get voucher money... Jimmy, why do you think it's patriotic for our troops to be used by the New World Order?
[02:02:10.736 --> 02:02:16.259]  I'm not saying it's patriotic, but we're already there, and for the troops that are there, all this politics is all out the window.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:21.083]  The CIA is, hold on, the CIA assessment says it's only going to get worse while we're there.
[02:02:21.758 --> 02:02:31.047]  If we don't do what we need to do... And it all seems to be happening just like you said it would.
[02:02:31.888 --> 02:02:34.070]  I don't know why we wasn't the absolute bums over there.
[02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:36.993]  We would have won this war a long time ago and be home.
[02:02:48.337 --> 02:02:48.797]  It's here!
[02:02:49.017 --> 02:02:53.800]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:03:01.824]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.504 --> 02:03:09.568]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.948 --> 02:03:16.792]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.324 --> 02:03:21.367]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.687 --> 02:03:25.170]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.650 --> 02:03:27.571]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.911 --> 02:03:31.834]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.623 --> 02:03:53.973]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.
[02:03:54.134 --> 02:04:04.206]  Find out about everything from job migration to evacuation information, such as major bridges in disrepair and FEMA evacuation time studies for coastal cities.
[02:04:04.666 --> 02:04:10.512]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.
[02:04:10.753 --> 02:04:21.484]  Find out everything from where to get water in an emergency, the geographic income levels, housing prices, complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on the 3,000 plus counties in the U.S.
[02:04:21.644 --> 02:04:22.705]  Full color photographs.
[02:04:22.885 --> 02:04:23.185]  We're good.
[02:04:47.119 --> 02:04:51.241]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:51.461 --> 02:04:53.221]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:53.481 --> 02:04:59.784]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:05:00.064 --> 02:05:06.186]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.426 --> 02:05:08.287]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument,
[02:05:08.547 --> 02:05:08.907]  I think so.
[02:05:31.045 --> 02:05:37.088]  Alright, I want to blitz through your calls because then I want to get into a big stack of news I haven't even mentioned yet.
[02:05:59.386 --> 02:06:01.987]  We've got another great guest coming up here at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:02.007 --> 02:06:07.390]  Right now, let's go to John in Michigan.
[02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:08.110]  Thanks for holding.
[02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:09.430]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:06:09.450 --> 02:06:10.631]  Hey, no problem.
[02:06:10.691 --> 02:06:14.833]  I don't mind holding because for some reason my media player ain't working and I got to hear your show.
[02:06:14.953 --> 02:06:15.533]  That's fine, sir.
[02:06:15.553 --> 02:06:15.873]  Go ahead.
[02:06:16.874 --> 02:06:22.536]  What are some main questions I should ask state representatives if I ever come in contact with them?
[02:06:22.856 --> 02:06:25.137]  Some main questions I can kind of apply some pressure.
[02:06:27.307 --> 02:06:30.268]  to them to investigate or to get involved.
[02:06:31.808 --> 02:06:37.249]  Well, I would simply point out that we don't need a bigger federal government, that it's way outside its scope.
[02:06:37.969 --> 02:06:53.893]  I would give them videos, I would give them documents, I would give them some of Ron Paul's material, and I would show them that they take a dollar of state tax money, a dollar of our money out of the state, and on average send about 33 cents back with federal strings attached.
[02:06:54.153 --> 02:06:55.173]  It's not free money.
[02:06:56.121 --> 02:07:03.589]  And then just to also point out to them that there are millions of laws, no one can follow them all, and that they need to
[02:07:05.583 --> 02:07:10.446]  You know, not get recruited into the good old boy club and sell out this country any further.
[02:07:10.927 --> 02:07:27.819]  But frankly, at this point, it's about getting the people to not go along and getting the people to not sign on to checkpoints in the name of stopping drunks or face scanning cameras on all the police cars and license plate reading cameras to stop the car thieves.
[02:07:28.059 --> 02:07:32.482]  You know, they've got all these good reasons for it, but the base reason is to control us.
[02:07:32.942 --> 02:07:38.286]  Things are so far gone now, we're just trying to get people to recognize who the enemy is.
[02:07:38.686 --> 02:07:46.331]  So as things get worse, the enemy can't pose as our savior and then always give us a solution that gets us deeper into a crisis.
[02:07:46.411 --> 02:07:47.752]  I appreciate your call.
[02:07:47.792 --> 02:07:48.232]  Anything else?
[02:07:48.793 --> 02:07:57.899]  Yeah, do you know offhand, I'm from Michigan and you're far away and you don't have, the show isn't on radio out here or anything, but I'm looking for some Michigan like group to connect with.
[02:07:58.757 --> 02:07:59.518]  To meet up with.
[02:07:59.618 --> 02:08:02.120]  I didn't know if you had any information that you guys could relay to me.
[02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:03.281]  Yeah, you got a computer.
[02:08:03.421 --> 02:08:06.784]  You know, there's probably a thousand groups up there on different issues.
[02:08:06.864 --> 02:08:10.527]  Second Amendment, land rights, border control.
[02:08:10.547 --> 02:08:11.928]  I appreciate your call.
[02:08:12.488 --> 02:08:21.455]  I mean, I really can't... I mean, this is a big world with a lot of things happening, and I can't begin to tell you which group you should join in Michigan.
[02:08:22.036 --> 02:08:23.477]  Why don't you start an organization?
[02:08:23.497 --> 02:08:28.401]  Why don't you start in your neighborhood, your community, and pick some issues you want to deal with.
[02:08:29.298 --> 02:08:44.888]  The problem is, Americans have been so brainwashed and have not even been taught the basics of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, so they're unable to even have a real conversation about our government.
[02:08:45.388 --> 02:08:49.270]  They can't even recognize what's going wrong in our government.
[02:08:49.631 --> 02:08:50.391]  Take the war.
[02:08:51.612 --> 02:08:54.334]  The Republicans and Democrats are run by the same global interests.
[02:08:54.374 --> 02:08:56.575]  They have a staged fight in front of the public.
[02:08:58.195 --> 02:09:16.547]  And to some extent it's a real fight because it's two different management teams who are betting for control but they have the same agenda and the establishment funds and finances whoever more aggressively and more deceptively is able to carry out that agenda of consolidation of power, of loss of liberty.
[02:09:17.978 --> 02:09:23.483]  And so I can get up here and tell you exactly what's going to happen in the Iraq War because I'm reading official Pentagon and Israeli plans.
[02:09:23.543 --> 02:09:27.346]  I can tell you it's meant to destroy America in the eyes of the world.
[02:09:27.447 --> 02:09:29.168]  I can tell you it's meant to kill our troops.
[02:09:29.528 --> 02:09:33.532]  I can tell you it's meant to make hundreds of billions a year for defense contractors.
[02:09:33.972 --> 02:09:39.017]  But the Republicans can come out and say you're a dirty liberal who wants us to lose if you're not for the war.
[02:09:39.337 --> 02:09:43.401]  And macho American men, they just go, well then I'm for it!
[02:09:45.931 --> 02:09:46.893]  And that's the end of it.
[02:09:46.953 --> 02:09:48.074]  We get taken again.
[02:09:48.154 --> 02:09:52.000]  I mean, that's what's so painful here, is to see us getting taken.
[02:09:53.863 --> 02:09:56.947]  And the neocons come out and say the North American Union is to fight terror.
[02:09:57.768 --> 02:10:00.272]  All the neocons line up and say, we've got to have it now.
[02:10:01.152 --> 02:10:07.854]  Notice the Neocon talk show host, that's again fake conservatives, they wouldn't talk about North American Union other than saying it didn't exist.
[02:10:08.175 --> 02:10:09.835]  Now they have to admit it exists.
[02:10:10.315 --> 02:10:12.136]  Now it's to fight Al Qaeda.
[02:10:12.456 --> 02:10:13.236]  There's no evidence.
[02:10:13.256 --> 02:10:14.177]  They just say that.
[02:10:14.217 --> 02:10:15.517]  See, it's so simple.
[02:10:16.037 --> 02:10:20.219]  And then weak-minded people hear it and go, okay, well, I'm suddenly for it.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.781]  Or they say, well, this is free market.
[02:10:24.821 --> 02:10:28.662]  The commie pinkos over at Mother Jones
[02:10:29.503 --> 02:10:32.746]  They don't want us to be able to pay for our roads!
[02:10:34.007 --> 02:10:35.088]  Pay as we go!
[02:10:35.208 --> 02:10:36.450]  I'm a libertarian!
[02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:40.653]  I think we ought to... I think we ought to give all our roads over to Spain!
[02:10:42.115 --> 02:10:44.677]  The roads were paid for two, three times over!
[02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:47.500]  They're giving them the roads!
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.341]  We're being signed over!
[02:10:50.062 --> 02:10:51.323]  We've been hijacked!
[02:10:52.885 --> 02:10:53.505]  Doesn't matter!
[02:10:53.806 --> 02:10:55.167]  Rather than stand up and fight it,
[02:10:55.916 --> 02:10:56.917]  They want to be lied to.
[02:10:56.977 --> 02:10:59.198]  Good propaganda isn't sophisticated, okay?
[02:11:01.059 --> 02:11:02.260]  For the general public.
[02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:06.843]  There's different brands of propaganda for different stratum of the society.
[02:11:09.645 --> 02:11:10.705]  It's just basic.
[02:11:10.765 --> 02:11:11.746]  It says, go to sleep.
[02:11:11.866 --> 02:11:12.666]  Everything's alright.
[02:11:12.686 --> 02:11:13.407]  You're patriotic.
[02:11:13.427 --> 02:11:13.947]  You're good.
[02:11:14.167 --> 02:11:15.048]  Let's just feel good.
[02:11:16.749 --> 02:11:21.512]  And once they get your hooks into you, you get emotionally and psychologically wedded to an idea
[02:11:22.432 --> 02:11:24.856]  You're not going to admit you're wrong.
[02:11:25.096 --> 02:11:26.138]  It's tribal, too.
[02:11:26.559 --> 02:11:27.660]  Most people aren't leaders.
[02:11:29.583 --> 02:11:30.605]  And so, it's simple.
[02:11:31.543 --> 02:11:33.684]  Our good guys are in our uniforms.
[02:11:33.704 --> 02:11:35.444]  They're over there fighting bad guys.
[02:11:36.205 --> 02:11:37.865]  And I'm rooting for our team.
[02:11:38.085 --> 02:11:40.986]  And while our troops are there, we gotta support the war.
[02:11:41.246 --> 02:11:44.568]  Because if we don't support the war, that destroys morale and then we'll lose.
[02:11:44.848 --> 02:11:46.208]  Like it's a football game.
[02:11:46.448 --> 02:11:48.829]  Hey man, this game's rigged, okay?
[02:11:49.049 --> 02:11:51.050]  It's like playing a slot machine that's rigged.
[02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:52.730]  Or a roulette wheel that's rigged.
[02:11:53.011 --> 02:11:54.971]  Or dice that have got weights in them.
[02:11:55.611 --> 02:11:58.752]  Or playing poker with somebody who's got a whole deck up their sleeve.
[02:11:59.073 --> 02:11:59.993]  It isn't real!
[02:12:00.894 --> 02:12:03.115]  They manipulate your tribal buttons!
[02:12:03.656 --> 02:12:08.038]  They push your buttons, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:12:09.639 --> 02:12:11.560]  Let's talk to Lewis in New Jersey.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:12.100]  Thanks for holding.
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:12.460]  Go ahead.
[02:12:14.642 --> 02:12:14.942]  Alex.
[02:12:16.382 --> 02:12:17.203]  Okay, let him go.
[02:12:17.263 --> 02:12:19.184]  Let's go ahead and go to Greg in Arkansas.
[02:12:19.244 --> 02:12:19.964]  Greg, you're on the air.
[02:12:20.885 --> 02:12:21.405]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:21.465 --> 02:12:23.366]  I'm one of those youthful eaters from Region 7.
[02:12:24.187 --> 02:12:30.070]  Just calling in that clip you played about the new technology the police cars have, and I just wanted to
[02:12:30.711 --> 02:12:57.585]  Possibly suggest to you maybe once a month having a call-in hour for something like non-violent civil disobedience and ways to get around some of these technologies such as the mention of this transparent spray that you can spray on your license plate whereas the cops can't read your license plate and leading to the lawyers having a cash register heyday in court with all the little people draining us all.
[02:12:58.334 --> 02:13:01.235]  And that would leave us some resources to... Here's the problem.
[02:13:01.295 --> 02:13:13.861]  They, a lot of these, there's different systems, but the main system simply scans optically the dark on the white face, on the light face.
[02:13:14.121 --> 02:13:16.342]  I don't know about a spray that defeats it.
[02:13:17.171 --> 02:13:18.293]  I've heard of it before.
[02:13:18.353 --> 02:13:28.204]  I don't know the company name, but it's just... Well, here's the deal, and I'm not saying that... People always tell me, well, I put super glue on my thumb when I went in the thumb scan, so they didn't really get my thumb.
[02:13:28.224 --> 02:13:29.886]  You know, so it had a film on it.
[02:13:30.267 --> 02:13:36.214]  It's better to go take over the legislature, show it's a federal ID card, and to remove it.
[02:13:37.293 --> 02:13:39.614]  You see, it's easier to go in and cut the head off.
[02:13:39.935 --> 02:13:41.175]  We're the boss, okay?
[02:13:41.415 --> 02:13:49.900]  You're not the boss, government bureaucrats, who've been told you're the boss by your private banker owners, who've trained you to be a bunch of blustering fools.
[02:13:50.181 --> 02:13:52.922]  You're destroying the country you live in, you idiots!
[02:13:53.302 --> 02:14:06.430]  Yeah, I do agree with you, but there are ways we can fight it, little ways that we can fight it, such as, locally, we're printing up little cards we hand to police if being stopped, and it's a reverse Miranda telling them that we do understand our rights and we'd prefer to have
[02:14:08.231 --> 02:14:09.852]  I think that's a wonderful idea.
[02:14:09.872 --> 02:14:10.232]  No, no, no.
[02:14:10.312 --> 02:14:13.014]  I'm not knocking you saying, you know, do this to your license plate.
[02:14:13.054 --> 02:14:16.135]  But take the law they almost passed in Texas, they are passing in other states.
[02:14:16.756 --> 02:14:21.798]  Federally written up, being implemented through the National Association of Legislatures and Governors.
[02:14:22.359 --> 02:14:23.439]  Again, it's all federally written.
[02:14:23.459 --> 02:14:26.481]  They bring it down here, change the name on the form letter, and pass it.
[02:14:27.462 --> 02:14:30.123]  If you tamper with that transponder, felony.
[02:14:30.303 --> 02:14:32.024]  And then, of course, the transponder can be broken.
[02:14:32.064 --> 02:14:34.205]  They're just going to claim you did it and send you to jail, too.
[02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:35.386]  You see?
[02:14:35.993 --> 02:14:40.479]  Yeah, well, there are little ways, you know, so that the people don't give up and feel defeated.
[02:14:40.499 --> 02:14:45.566]  There are little ways that we can needle these people constantly, like triple mailings, IRS forms.
[02:14:45.747 --> 02:14:53.057]  I know, but all that will do, sir, what that will do is then make them come up with newer generations of it.
[02:14:53.517 --> 02:15:06.669]  Rather than... The government wanted to have a debate five years ago about face scanning technology in Tampa because they kept slot-teaming innocent people on the streets because it was flagging innocent people with their children as axe murderers, okay?
[02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:16.398]  And instead the debate was then, oh, it's not the technology's bad or a violation of your Fourth Amendment, it's that it doesn't always work and now they said they perfected it so it's okay.
[02:15:16.699 --> 02:15:18.100]  So it's similar to what you're saying.
[02:15:19.093 --> 02:15:19.453]  All right.
[02:15:19.853 --> 02:15:21.174]  You're saying get around it.
[02:15:21.234 --> 02:15:22.954]  No, I'm saying let's get everybody mad about it.
[02:15:23.174 --> 02:15:25.855]  Go take over our government and dismantle the whole thing.
[02:15:26.075 --> 02:15:31.117]  Instead of having ways to beat red light cameras, let's go stop red light cameras from going in.
[02:15:31.517 --> 02:15:33.738]  Not because I'm against red light runners getting caught.
[02:15:33.778 --> 02:15:34.538]  It is a big problem.
[02:15:34.578 --> 02:15:35.158]  I'm sick of it.
[02:15:35.418 --> 02:15:36.759]  These people just run them all the time.
[02:15:37.139 --> 02:15:38.159]  You put cops there.
[02:15:38.499 --> 02:15:39.579]  It's a serious ticket.
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:40.980]  It's reckless driving.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:45.643]  Okay, and cops should be concerned, and a lot of them are, because this is going to get rid of your jobs.
[02:15:45.923 --> 02:16:04.794]  The problem is Lockheed Martin, that runs a lot of these cameras, has been caught shortening the yellow lights, and causing more accidents to get more money, where people accidentally pull out a foot or two, you still get a ticket, they've been caught doing a bunch of stuff, and there isn't an officer involved, and so it's been found in San Diego, they had to remove them, but it isn't a real ticket.
[02:16:06.375 --> 02:16:09.497]  I don't want defense contractors involved domestically.
[02:16:10.847 --> 02:16:15.929]  The defense contractors figured out with the banks, why should we just fund the military with tax money?
[02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:17.670]  Why don't we just take America over?
[02:16:17.710 --> 02:16:20.551]  It's what Eisenhower warned about in 1961.
[02:16:20.751 --> 02:16:21.852]  Well, it happened, folks.
[02:16:22.152 --> 02:16:22.612]  Okay?
[02:16:22.852 --> 02:16:24.192]  They brainwashed your police.
[02:16:24.393 --> 02:16:25.533]  They bought up your government.
[02:16:25.693 --> 02:16:26.373]  They took over.
[02:16:26.413 --> 02:16:27.754]  Now they're seizing the roads.
[02:16:27.914 --> 02:16:29.895]  They're putting in a Pentagon control grid.
[02:16:30.095 --> 02:16:30.875]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:16:30.915 --> 02:16:31.775]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:33.056 --> 02:16:34.797]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Texas.
[02:16:34.837 --> 02:16:35.417]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:16:36.392 --> 02:16:39.274]  Hi, I have a question about building 7 on 9-11.
[02:16:40.494 --> 02:16:42.836]  Yes, at 520 in the afternoon they blew up, yes.
[02:16:43.036 --> 02:16:55.443]  Yeah, how does a man, I saw your movie Terror Storm, how does this guy Silverstein blow up his own building without somebody like the Attorney General investigating it since he had the most to gain through insurance?
[02:16:56.058 --> 02:17:01.079]  How do we get around the Attorney General of the United States or New York investigating?
[02:17:01.459 --> 02:17:03.860]  Is it legal for you just to blow up your own building?
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.060]  People don't get into those positions unless they're bought and paid for it.
[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:13.282]  You know Building 7 had the Defense Intelligence, CIA, FBI, State and County and City Emergency Management.
[02:17:13.642 --> 02:17:19.063]  They were having a terror drill that morning so they'd already moved all the key command systems out to the end of the pier.
[02:17:19.083 --> 02:17:19.563]  Did you know that?
[02:17:20.163 --> 02:17:32.689]  Yes, I've seen your movie, Terror Storm, and I've known that that was the theory behind it, but I don't understand why somebody, the papers don't just say, well look, you can't... Because the papers are owned by the defense contractors.
[02:17:33.430 --> 02:17:35.111]  Have you ever looked at who owns the media, sir?
[02:17:35.731 --> 02:17:36.131]  Yeah, I know.
[02:17:36.151 --> 02:17:36.611]  It's simple.
[02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:40.533]  Look, look, the hardware manufacturers and the banks, that's what they do.
[02:17:40.573 --> 02:17:41.214]  They take over.
[02:17:41.254 --> 02:17:43.955]  There was a hostile corporate takeover of America.
[02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:51.171]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:52.372 --> 02:17:57.195]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:57.395 --> 02:18:00.137]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.177 --> 02:18:01.297]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:02.638 --> 02:18:07.241]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:08.162 --> 02:18:15.366]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:16.411 --> 02:18:19.473]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:21.615 --> 02:18:25.077]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:26.058 --> 02:18:27.339]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:27.579 --> 02:18:29.800]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.841 --> 02:18:36.705]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:37.385 --> 02:18:37.806]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:37.846 --> 02:18:38.046]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.615 --> 02:18:50.580]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:56.325]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:18:56.365 --> 02:19:00.649]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:19:00.989 --> 02:19:04.012]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:19:04.312 --> 02:19:07.755]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:19:08.075 --> 02:19:17.445]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:19:17.685 --> 02:19:21.189]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:28.537]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:19:45.333 --> 02:19:47.815]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.356 --> 02:19:55.483]  Did you know the Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the communist world in the last days?
[02:19:56.323 --> 02:20:01.949]  Did you know that it predicts the confrontation between atheistic communism and the western world of Christianity?
[02:20:02.489 --> 02:20:02.829]  I think so.
[02:20:17.213 --> 02:20:18.714]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:18.734 --> 02:20:19.074]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:19.094 --> 02:20:22.677]  Call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:22.697 --> 02:20:23.378]  It's free.
[02:20:23.518 --> 02:20:26.400]  Call now while our operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:45.180]  It's a fact.
[02:20:45.381 --> 02:20:49.823]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:20:50.263 --> 02:20:55.466]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:58.949]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[02:20:59.209 --> 02:21:06.313]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:21:06.673 --> 02:21:13.876]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:21:14.296 --> 02:21:16.137]  We also do credit restoration.
[02:21:16.597 --> 02:21:22.920]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:26.902]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[02:21:27.262 --> 02:21:29.865]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.

[02:21:32.008 --> 02:21:33.409]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:36.793]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order!
[02:21:51.835 --> 02:21:56.161]  Continuing with your phone calls, Tommy Pallotta, producer of A Scanner Darkly, will be joining us.
[02:21:56.661 --> 02:21:59.004]  The DVD released nationally was yesterday.
[02:22:00.626 --> 02:22:02.569]  Great dystopic anti-New World Order film.
[02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:05.753]  Matrix of Evil, now available on DVD.
[02:22:05.853 --> 02:22:09.157]  Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, exposed, now available on DVD.
[02:22:09.955 --> 02:22:12.276]  The Masters of Terror, now available on DVD.
[02:22:12.756 --> 02:22:15.197]  America Destroyed by Design, now available on DVD.
[02:22:15.497 --> 02:22:23.441]  My Police State Trilogy, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, in a box set, all three films.
[02:22:24.101 --> 02:22:24.521]  And that's only $34.95.
[02:22:25.922 --> 02:22:27.683]  We've got, for those three films together,
[02:22:28.764 --> 02:22:33.467]  Seven of my films, my first seven films, that we never even had time to get on DVD.
[02:22:33.747 --> 02:22:43.914]  We've got them for you, nice handsome packaging, and of course your purchase also makes this broadcast possible, so please visit Infowars.com to order those, or simply call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:22:43.934 --> 02:22:47.736]  You can also pick them up at Brave New Books in downtown Austin.
[02:22:52.145 --> 02:22:54.487]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:22:54.567 --> 02:22:57.289]  Let's talk to Jane in Maryland.
[02:22:57.329 --> 02:22:57.970]  Go ahead, Jane.
[02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.550]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:58.770 --> 02:22:59.411]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:00.512]  Good to talk to you.
[02:23:00.532 --> 02:23:01.252]  Good to talk to you.
[02:23:01.433 --> 02:23:06.757]  I've been listening to you for quite a while, and this is great, getting a chance to talk to you.
[02:23:07.277 --> 02:23:14.643]  I wanted to bring to your attention something from the Early Morning Gazette that came in.
[02:23:14.843 --> 02:23:20.548]  I'm a new transplant to Germantown, Maryland, which is about 20 miles outside of
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:25.903]  The district, which is what they call Washington, D.C., around here, and I'm from Montana.
[02:23:26.924 --> 02:23:45.818]  And here, apparently, I guess this happened in the spring, there's a new state law going into effect on January 2nd, and it says, parents, if your children in grades 6 through 9 are not vaccinated by January 2nd, 2007, they will be excluded from attending school.
[02:23:47.719 --> 02:23:49.203]  Now again, that's a policy.
[02:23:49.403 --> 02:23:52.030]  Then they're going to slap on... This is nationwide.
[02:23:52.865 --> 02:23:57.106]  Then they're going to slap that they're truant, and then try to criminally come after you.
[02:23:58.266 --> 02:24:03.827]  As far as I know, the District of Columbia tried to pass a law saying you had to vaccinate, but that was overturned.
[02:24:03.888 --> 02:24:08.329]  As far as I know, where you live, there in Maryland, it is not a law.
[02:24:08.449 --> 02:24:11.449]  I mean, what does it say in the article, or is it just vague?
[02:24:11.729 --> 02:24:19.251]  It is actually a half-page ad of sorts that says, locations for free vaccinations.
[02:24:19.471 --> 02:24:31.618]  Well, I mean, I'm sure you've heard many of your listeners talk about, before school, they just announced, nationwide, it's the law, you'll be arrested, it's the law, there is no law, it is, again, this is an example of mass-coordinated fraud.
[02:24:32.178 --> 02:24:32.958]  I think so.
[02:24:33.519 --> 02:24:34.379]  Well, I mean, I know so.
[02:24:34.559 --> 02:24:36.540]  Listen, go find out for yourself there's no law.
[02:24:37.161 --> 02:24:38.261]  It's a policy.
[02:24:38.301 --> 02:24:40.923]  That just means some bureaucrat says, oh, you have to do this.
[02:24:41.543 --> 02:24:43.584]  See, so much of tyranny is just, you have to do this.
[02:24:44.465 --> 02:24:46.066]  And of course, autism is 1 in 168 from 1 in 25,000.
[02:24:48.877 --> 02:24:52.981]  Twenty-something years ago, they're not going to stop until everybody's got autism.
[02:24:53.302 --> 02:24:53.542]  Right.
[02:24:53.682 --> 02:24:57.125]  And then they said they took the mercury out.
[02:24:57.326 --> 02:24:58.727]  No, they increased the level.
[02:24:59.508 --> 02:25:00.989]  And it's ridiculous.
[02:25:01.390 --> 02:25:09.458]  My nurse practitioner who took care of my children, they're two and four right now, so this school age doesn't really affect them right now.
[02:25:10.171 --> 02:25:13.975]  But it may affect them in 10 years when they're in school.
[02:25:13.995 --> 02:25:14.596]  Oh, that's a good thing.
[02:25:14.616 --> 02:25:17.198]  They'll try to have their doctor refuse care if they have them.
[02:25:17.458 --> 02:25:23.785]  But you can just type into Google the name of your town and, you know, anti-vaccine doctor.
[02:25:24.986 --> 02:25:25.687]  That would be good.
[02:25:26.697 --> 02:25:27.697]  Look, look, look, look.
[02:25:27.857 --> 02:25:28.798]  There is no law.
[02:25:28.998 --> 02:25:30.738]  It shows how criminal your government is.
[02:25:30.918 --> 02:25:32.459]  They're a pack of lying scum.
[02:25:32.699 --> 02:25:41.321]  This is the same government that sterilized black men and women and radiated children and nerve gassed our troops.
[02:25:41.581 --> 02:25:44.702]  They're a bunch of lying criminal murderers, okay?
[02:25:44.982 --> 02:25:46.443]  These are murdering scum.
[02:25:46.463 --> 02:25:48.083]  You ought to get angry.
[02:25:48.423 --> 02:25:51.484]  Telling you you've got to do something that isn't even a law.
[02:25:52.466 --> 02:25:54.927]  And by the way, I don't care if they pass a law, I gotta take shots.
[02:25:55.227 --> 02:25:59.288]  Over my dead body, you murdering, eugenics, Nazi Phil!
[02:25:59.708 --> 02:26:00.409]  Exactly.
[02:26:00.489 --> 02:26:04.510]  Now, what's the difference between a law and a mandate and a policy?
[02:26:04.770 --> 02:26:08.251]  Because you use all three words on their website.
[02:26:11.761 --> 02:26:35.679]  Most legislatures have passed a law that there should be a regulation, that a school have a policy, and then you read the law, and we've done this many times, I ought to go pull the laws up, they're all the same, and it says we passed a law that under the state spending package and federal grants, that it is in the policy booklet that we ask you to be vaccinated.
[02:26:35.819 --> 02:26:38.601]  So, again, it's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:26:38.641 --> 02:26:39.422]  There is no law.
[02:26:40.962 --> 02:26:41.422]  It doesn't matter.
[02:26:41.522 --> 02:26:43.843]  These are only for two particular vaccinations.
[02:26:43.883 --> 02:26:45.704]  This is going to be all across the country.
[02:26:45.784 --> 02:26:54.748]  Ma'am, if you're going to put your children in government training camps, when it comes time to enroll them, just say, oh yeah, I'm here for the vaccine waiver form.
[02:26:55.208 --> 02:26:58.749]  Or you can call your health department and they will have it and they will send it to you.
[02:26:58.949 --> 02:27:00.330]  But again, you don't even have to have that.
[02:27:00.410 --> 02:27:01.551]  That registers your children.
[02:27:01.571 --> 02:27:02.931]  There have been the court cases.
[02:27:02.951 --> 02:27:04.212]  There is no law.
[02:27:04.512 --> 02:27:05.152]  Let me say it again.
[02:27:05.512 --> 02:27:05.972]  No law.
[02:27:06.312 --> 02:27:07.293]  No law in England.
[02:27:07.573 --> 02:27:08.493]  No law in Germany.
[02:27:08.794 --> 02:27:09.814]  No law in the U.S.
[02:27:10.498 --> 02:27:15.842]  Though they use the same organized fraud, and that's racketeering, against you.
[02:27:16.302 --> 02:27:19.364]  Proving they are criminal scum!
[02:27:19.924 --> 02:27:20.725]  Thank you for the call.
[02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:21.786]  Think about it.
[02:27:23.307 --> 02:27:26.789]  So much of what these bastards do isn't even a law.
[02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:33.053]  But then they expel your child, then they get truancy criminal charges.
[02:27:33.774 --> 02:27:34.494]  Because they're criminals.
[02:27:35.615 --> 02:27:36.596]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.996 --> 02:27:38.517]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.526 --> 02:27:42.328]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:49.451]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:49.651 --> 02:27:53.053]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.233 --> 02:27:56.695]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:56.986 --> 02:28:00.228]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.248 --> 02:28:05.711]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:28:05.751 --> 02:28:15.376]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:15.516 --> 02:28:16.817]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:28:16.837 --> 02:28:22.280]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:27.224]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.305 --> 02:28:28.666]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:28.846 --> 02:28:32.870]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:34.812]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:28:45.453 --> 02:28:47.034]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:28:47.355 --> 02:28:55.962]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:28:56.322 --> 02:29:02.047]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:29:02.427 --> 02:29:09.870]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:15.572]  Davis Products is offering high quality solid cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.

[02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:50.454]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:29:50.855 --> 02:29:56.281]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:29:56.741 --> 02:29:57.822]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:29:57.862 --> 02:30:01.907]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:30:02.547 --> 02:30:15.874]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:30:15.894 --> 02:30:21.697]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:30:21.977 --> 02:30:27.860]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:30:31.463 --> 02:30:34.646]  When investing, always proceed with caution.

[02:30:35.707 --> 02:30:37.889]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:30:37.909 --> 02:30:37.969]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:30:54.810 --> 02:31:00.273]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:31:00.313 --> 02:31:05.316]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:31:05.737 --> 02:31:08.218]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:31:08.458 --> 02:31:10.860]  There wasn't by as many as there was a while ago.
[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:16.143]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:31:19.064 --> 02:31:40.609]  We looked down a river and we seen the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drums They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[02:31:43.479 --> 02:31:45.140]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:45.160 --> 02:31:48.401]  We're going to jam some of your calls in, hit some news, get Tommy Palata's take on it.
[02:31:48.441 --> 02:31:52.943]  Tommy's one of my very best friends and he really is aware of what's going on in the world.
[02:31:52.963 --> 02:31:57.305]  I had a chance to see him when I was out in Los Angeles over the weekend.
[02:31:57.365 --> 02:31:58.386]  We took a bike ride down
[02:32:11.065 --> 02:32:13.326]  on the beach there, Malibu and Venice.
[02:32:13.887 --> 02:32:15.127]  That was a lot of fun Saturday.
[02:32:15.868 --> 02:32:17.409]  Wish I had more time to do such things.
[02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:22.812]  But let me just comment briefly before we go to Tommy about what it boils down to.
[02:32:23.012 --> 02:32:27.735]  Elites and king rats throughout history have tried to dominate populations.
[02:32:28.977 --> 02:32:31.798]  Those that run our society are very sophisticated.
[02:32:31.838 --> 02:32:32.798]  They're very advanced.
[02:32:33.298 --> 02:32:39.339]  They know they're going to do things financially, economically, societal changes that are going to make you get angry and rebel.
[02:32:39.619 --> 02:32:43.540]  So they're building a huge prison grid around you right now to have their way with you.
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:46.100]  And really, we just need to get mad.
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:47.661]  We need to start saying no to the system.
[02:32:47.681 --> 02:32:52.742]  You heard that lady earlier, how they got ads in the paper saying, you've got to take vaccines for your child to be in school.
[02:32:53.642 --> 02:32:54.322]  It's a policy.
[02:32:55.942 --> 02:32:56.702]  There's no law.
[02:32:56.843 --> 02:32:59.124]  They just lie and tell you it's a law.
[02:33:00.444 --> 02:33:02.105]  Right there is all the evidence you need.
[02:33:02.365 --> 02:33:06.007]  A national concerted campaign telling you about laws that don't exist.
[02:33:08.549 --> 02:33:09.669]  It is a fraud.
[02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:11.890]  Just go verify it in your state or county.
[02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:13.091]  You'll find out in 10 minutes.
[02:33:13.471 --> 02:33:14.652]  Go read your state laws.
[02:33:14.872 --> 02:33:17.754]  Just type in Alabama's law on vaccination.
[02:33:19.615 --> 02:33:20.295]  Texas law.
[02:33:20.982 --> 02:33:21.642]  Go find out!
[02:33:21.682 --> 02:33:30.406]  And then when you see the news on your local TV tell you it's the law, right before school starts, in a concerted propaganda campaign, you will understand.
[02:33:30.846 --> 02:33:35.068]  And the idiot newsreader, they're just reading some newsprint that came down from the network.
[02:33:36.108 --> 02:33:38.149]  They just package it in little news packages.
[02:33:38.209 --> 02:33:39.790]  The videos sent down to them now.
[02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:42.591]  It makes it so easy, quote, for downsizing.
[02:33:43.111 --> 02:33:43.952]  It's a fraud.
[02:33:44.852 --> 02:33:47.853]  Talking about a total surveillance, control grid society.
[02:33:47.873 --> 02:33:49.754]  They did a lot of research for this movie.
[02:33:51.415 --> 02:33:55.638]  And it was shot live-action, that is, real actors, and then they rotoscoped it.
[02:33:56.658 --> 02:33:59.620]  And Tommy Pallotta is credited by the Philip K. Dick estate.
[02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:07.505]  That's Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall.
[02:34:08.125 --> 02:34:09.906]  He's the most adapted sci-fi writer.
[02:34:12.435 --> 02:34:26.652]  It was, it was, the family said this is the truest adaptation ever and they said it really happened because Tommy got the big actors Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson and others together.
[02:34:27.839 --> 02:34:31.240]  He got the film made when some said it couldn't be done.
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:36.762]  This was not a big studio like Disney or Pixar making this.
[02:34:37.382 --> 02:34:39.903]  They did it and he brought it to market.
[02:34:39.963 --> 02:34:44.104]  It did very well all over the planet and is still in theater some places.
[02:34:44.124 --> 02:34:45.484]  It's now come out on DVD.
[02:34:45.505 --> 02:34:46.905]  It came out yesterday.
[02:34:47.891 --> 02:34:50.954]  And I hope in the next few days we're going to put a few clips up on the web of it.
[02:34:50.974 --> 02:34:51.775]  I've just been too busy.
[02:34:52.175 --> 02:34:56.639]  He gave me a copy when I was there of the DVD and of course I left it in the hotel room at 5 a.m.
[02:34:56.699 --> 02:34:58.541]  stumbling around to go catch my flight.
[02:34:58.841 --> 02:35:01.063]  But I'm going to be getting some clips up on the web here in the next few days.
[02:35:01.404 --> 02:35:02.705]  Amazing new film.
[02:35:03.526 --> 02:35:03.906]  I'm in it.
[02:35:03.926 --> 02:35:06.108]  And then you've got the commentaries.
[02:35:06.869 --> 02:35:08.250]  It's got a lot of great stuff on it.
[02:35:09.482 --> 02:35:10.523]  I haven't even seen it.
[02:35:10.563 --> 02:35:12.084]  I saw him shooting the commentaries.
[02:35:12.144 --> 02:35:14.046]  I know what's on it because I was on the other end of it.
[02:35:14.506 --> 02:35:16.187]  But I have seen the film, of course, I'm in it.
[02:35:16.627 --> 02:35:18.268]  Tommy Pallotta, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:35:18.689 --> 02:35:19.529]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:35:21.010 --> 02:35:22.471]  It's good to be talking to you again.
[02:35:22.491 --> 02:35:24.473]  It was great seeing you out there in L.A.
[02:35:24.773 --> 02:35:26.614]  Yeah, it was fun.
[02:35:26.774 --> 02:35:29.056]  Now you're back in Texas now visiting family.
[02:35:29.456 --> 02:35:30.357]  Yeah, I am indeed.
[02:35:31.975 --> 02:35:32.615]  Back in Texas.
[02:35:32.955 --> 02:35:35.678]  And Scanner Darkly was predominantly shot in Austin.
[02:35:36.139 --> 02:35:39.522]  Yeah, it was pretty much all shots except for the B-roll that we shot.
[02:35:39.962 --> 02:35:42.885]  Tell folks about Scanner Darkly, how it was done.
[02:35:43.526 --> 02:35:50.352]  I mean, really, it is a dystopic film that is pretty much what we're living in today just a few years from now.
[02:35:51.013 --> 02:35:56.578]  Well, I mean, Philip K. Dick, you know, for the listeners who have read him,
[02:35:57.076 --> 02:36:03.077]  You know, that proved to be, he's proved to be very prescient in a lot of his visions of the future.
[02:36:03.877 --> 02:36:11.279]  And, you know, he does that on a sort of really personal level, and I think probably none so more personally than with the Scanner Darkly.
[02:36:11.319 --> 02:36:18.721]  Scanner Darkly is a sort of very autobiographical tale, really about Philip K. Dick and his friends.
[02:36:19.341 --> 02:36:24.342]  And I just think that some people tend to be much more sensitive to their environment.
[02:36:24.362 --> 02:36:25.182]  A lot of times that
[02:36:25.646 --> 02:36:31.070]  These people aren't necessarily predicting the future, but they're sensitive to the things and the trends that are going on around them.
[02:36:31.470 --> 02:36:34.272]  And they're just able to sort of express them in ways.
[02:36:34.332 --> 02:36:37.895]  You know, this was written in, I believe, 77, the book was.
[02:36:38.355 --> 02:36:41.637]  And it was sort of during the Nixon era.
[02:36:42.118 --> 02:36:49.743]  And so a lot of the paranoia, you know, a lot of the trends that we see happening in government today were happening back then, and a lot of these things sort of happen in cycles.
[02:36:50.259 --> 02:37:00.121]  So we really felt it was appropriate to sort of, you know, adapt this novel and do a really sort of literal adaptation, but sort of view it in our time.
[02:37:02.802 --> 02:37:05.543]  Well, you did a bang-up job and the research is amazing.
[02:37:05.863 --> 02:37:08.424]  Break down the basics for those that haven't seen it in theaters.
[02:37:09.504 --> 02:37:16.786]  By the way, the fellow running the show right now, John Harmon, he went out and bought it on DVD last night and watched it and said he liked it.
[02:37:17.506 --> 02:37:17.806]  Oh, cool.
[02:37:19.355 --> 02:37:20.116]  That's always good to hear.
[02:37:21.717 --> 02:37:25.561]  It's really a tale of paranoia.
[02:37:26.122 --> 02:37:39.015]  It's about a surveillance society in which an undercover narcotics agent actually starts to see himself and has the narc on himself.
[02:37:39.495 --> 02:37:42.258]  Basically, it's a really shadowy government
[02:37:42.705 --> 02:37:48.428]  And that's the point of the Surveillance Society is not to bring security, but to bring paranoia and mistrust and the whole tattletale system.
[02:38:01.443 --> 02:38:12.992]  The climax of the film away, but we're talking about corporate, militarized connections to government, mercenary-type forces, the people that claim they're fighting a problem are really behind the problem.
[02:38:13.673 --> 02:38:15.034]  I mean, it mirrors reality.
[02:38:15.815 --> 02:38:25.042]  Yeah, I mean, this sort of imagines a future where the majority of the people are employed by the government actually surveying the other people.
[02:38:25.863 --> 02:38:29.766]  And again, it sort of takes it to the extreme where the guy is actually surveying himself.
[02:38:32.546 --> 02:38:34.428]  And that's because he's got the scramble suit.
[02:38:34.468 --> 02:38:35.829]  Tell folks about the scramble suit.
[02:38:35.849 --> 02:38:48.501]  Well, the scramble suit is a sort of conceit that these undercover agents even have to hide identity from each other because there's so much distrust.
[02:38:48.901 --> 02:38:54.286]  So even if you're in law enforcement, you can't even expose who you are to the other law enforcement agencies.
[02:38:54.787 --> 02:38:58.350]  And they have this suit that hides their identity and what it does is project millions
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:09.363]  Of different characteristics of different people, all shapes, sizes, colors, you know, onto themselves so that it's sort of like those those pixelations that they do in the cops videos and stuff like that, but almost a live version of that.
[02:39:11.503 --> 02:39:15.704]  And that's to stop the face scanning cameras as well that are everywhere.
[02:39:16.184 --> 02:39:22.366]  Yeah, there's, you know, I mean, you know, we should tell everybody that you're a consultant on this movie as well, like in the very early stages.
[02:39:22.386 --> 02:39:28.287]  When I came to Texas to make this movie, Alex was the first person I called.
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:43.324]  When I got back into town from New York and told him I told him that about this movie and what we're doing and and I really wanted to sort of integrate a lot of the biometric technology and and those kinds of ideas and theme and sort of update that because that really necessarily wasn't in the book.
[02:39:43.823 --> 02:39:46.524]  But, you know, it was something that I was aware of was happening now.
[02:39:46.704 --> 02:39:47.205]  Well, that's right.
[02:39:47.225 --> 02:39:50.886]  You've got how they track people to triangulate a camera.
[02:39:51.146 --> 02:39:53.067]  They will track the cell phone location.
[02:39:53.347 --> 02:39:58.150]  And, of course, the cell phones like their little TV slash radio slash everything like it is now.
[02:39:58.170 --> 02:40:01.191]  Of course, you were writing this adaptation a few years ago.
[02:40:01.651 --> 02:40:05.653]  And now they're openly announcing that, hey, we're tracking you with your cell phone.
[02:40:05.673 --> 02:40:06.534]  We're listening to you.
[02:40:07.194 --> 02:40:07.374]  Right.
[02:40:09.298 --> 02:40:09.919]  Unbelievable.
[02:40:10.039 --> 02:40:12.801]  I tell you, folks, you've got to get this DVD, Tommy.
[02:40:13.021 --> 02:40:14.021]  Now, what about the extras?
[02:40:14.061 --> 02:40:15.442]  Because I'm a total moron.
[02:40:16.243 --> 02:40:22.007]  Like I said, waking up at 5 a.m., I somehow left it in the hotel room, and I haven't gone out and bought a copy.
[02:40:22.087 --> 02:40:24.909]  I am going to buy one tonight, because I want to watch the extras.
[02:40:24.929 --> 02:40:26.330]  This has got a bunch of extras in it.
[02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:29.512]  This has got you, Rick Linklater, how you guys shot it.
[02:40:29.552 --> 02:40:33.475]  I mean, while we were making the film, I saw cameras all over the place documenting it.
[02:40:33.775 --> 02:40:35.316]  That's a film within a film itself.
[02:40:35.616 --> 02:40:36.197]  Tell me about that.
[02:40:36.477 --> 02:40:49.101]  Yeah, well, there's commentary by Keanu Reeves, Richard Linklater, myself, a novelist, Jonathan Latham, who knows a lot about Philip K. Dick, and Philip K. Dick's daughter, Issa Dick Hackett.
[02:40:50.301 --> 02:41:01.344]  And then there's sort of two little featurettes, one that really gets behind the filming of Scanner Darkly, kind of the live-action version of it, and the other one that sort of goes behind the scenes with how the animation was done.
[02:41:02.404 --> 02:41:04.325]  So that's really kind of the extras that you can expect.
[02:41:05.157 --> 02:41:06.398]  Well, I can't wait to see it.
[02:41:07.418 --> 02:41:10.220]  Tommy, it was tough making this film.
[02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:16.403]  You guys did this on a record low budget, what, $8.5 million, when normally Keanu Reeves would get, what, $20 million?
[02:41:16.423 --> 02:41:18.904]  He made over $100 million on one movie alone.
[02:41:18.944 --> 02:41:23.867]  I mean, you made this movie for a fraction of what one of the actors would have been paid.
[02:41:24.127 --> 02:41:25.348]  How did you get that done?
[02:41:25.368 --> 02:41:31.091]  Because I know the Dick Estate, on the official Philip K. Dick website, really give you the lion's share of the credit.
[02:41:31.667 --> 02:41:36.691]  Well, it was a passion project for everybody involved.
[02:41:37.331 --> 02:41:43.735]  I think it was one of those rare instances where people were really attracted to Philip K. Dick's vision.
[02:41:44.196 --> 02:41:48.118]  They were attracted to the idea of how we were going to be visually treating it.
[02:41:48.839 --> 02:41:51.221]  A lot of credit goes to Richard Linklater.
[02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:52.702]  Actors love working with him.
[02:41:55.103 --> 02:41:58.886]  Once you get these elements into place, and you have that spirit of,
[02:41:59.571 --> 02:42:00.892]  You know, we're going to make this movie.
[02:42:00.912 --> 02:42:03.433]  This is a movie that wouldn't be made for a large budget.
[02:42:04.533 --> 02:42:06.874]  And so the only way to do it was to do it in a low budget.
[02:42:06.934 --> 02:42:12.937]  And the only way to get it done was to sort of put these elements together that would make it attractive to a studio and to an audience.
[02:42:13.237 --> 02:42:19.760]  Yeah, it's fair to say the corporates, because even when you make a film, then you have to go sell it to a major corporation for distribution.
[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:25.983]  Is it fair to say they didn't like some of the, I don't know how much we can get into, but didn't like some of the anti-government message?
[02:42:26.964 --> 02:42:27.845]  You know, not really.
[02:42:27.925 --> 02:42:32.708]  I mean, I don't think that there was ever a time where I felt that there was censorship going on.
[02:42:33.548 --> 02:42:39.072]  I mean, I think in any time that you're sort of making a movie, there's going to be a back and forth, just sort of creatively.
[02:42:39.092 --> 02:42:42.815]  Stuff like, we don't like that cop blowing that guy's head off.
[02:42:43.935 --> 02:42:44.656]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:42:44.916 --> 02:42:50.039]  I mean, you know, there is sort of talk like that, but it didn't really kind of feel conspiratorial to me.
[02:42:50.119 --> 02:42:50.920]  It kind of felt more
[02:42:51.579 --> 02:42:53.239]  Like, um, just an opinion.
[02:42:53.499 --> 02:42:56.820]  Kind of a self-censorship thing, just where it's their own idea, their own view.
[02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:57.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:58.161 --> 02:43:09.883]  So, I mean, I have to say that my, you know, that my, a lot of people ask me about what it's like working with the studio, and, you know, almost non-dramatically, I have to say that it's pretty normal.
[02:43:09.983 --> 02:43:13.304]  I mean, it's just really, it seems it's more about business than anything else.
[02:43:15.707 --> 02:43:19.710]  Well, I tell you, I think it's fair to say Scanner Darkly is avant-garde.
[02:43:19.770 --> 02:43:21.711]  There's nothing out there that looks like this.
[02:43:22.231 --> 02:43:28.995]  For folks who have seen Waking Life and love it, and it's an evergreen cult classic now, that's done in more of a free form.
[02:43:29.996 --> 02:43:34.138]  Every frame of this is a work of art, and you guys gave us a congruent
[02:43:35.154 --> 02:43:38.117]  Look with all of the, what was it, 40, 50 animators.
[02:43:38.457 --> 02:43:39.898]  Can you get into that a little bit for us?
[02:43:40.319 --> 02:43:45.683]  Yeah, I mean, I think, I think Wake, I mean, first we should mention that you have a cameo in Scanner Darkly.
[02:43:46.924 --> 02:43:50.667]  A lot like, you're the only person who came from sort of waking life to Scanner Darkly.
[02:43:51.648 --> 02:43:59.135]  And you play sort of a similar character, you know, person with a bullhorn, you know, kind of, kind of yelling out.
[02:43:59.175 --> 02:44:01.717]  But yeah, I mean, the thought behind
[02:44:02.196 --> 02:44:08.618]  Scanner Darkly was that it was going to be a much more consistent feel and look.
[02:44:08.938 --> 02:44:11.959]  And we wanted to really sort of make it like a graphic novel come to life.
[02:44:12.559 --> 02:44:15.860]  And we wanted the animation to really serve the story first and foremost.
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:19.321]  You know, Waking Life was really a nice experiment.
[02:44:20.241 --> 02:44:26.743]  And, you know, it had a lot to do with sort of animation and sort of showcase that animation and dealing with these sort of abstract ideas.
[02:44:27.283 --> 02:44:29.584]  But Scanner Darkly is sort of a much more
[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:31.781]  It's a very detailed and subtle story.
[02:44:32.461 --> 02:44:35.842]  It's a narrative that we sort of tell that has a beginning and middle and end.
[02:44:36.282 --> 02:44:38.483]  And so we kind of really wanted to have that consistency.
[02:44:40.323 --> 02:44:42.344]  And we had a much larger budget.
[02:44:42.364 --> 02:44:46.045]  I mean, Waking Life was made for about $1.5 million.
[02:44:46.685 --> 02:44:49.426]  So we had quite a bit more money to play with.
[02:44:50.126 --> 02:44:51.727]  And that was shot in 1999 or was it 2000?
[02:44:51.767 --> 02:44:53.647]  It was one of those, 1999 or 2000.
[02:44:53.687 --> 02:44:54.408]  I think it was late 1999.
[02:45:00.093 --> 02:45:06.277]  With that, we were able to hire more artists, and we were able to spend more time.
[02:45:06.317 --> 02:45:11.361]  I mean, it took about 500 man-hours per minute to animate this scene.
[02:45:12.281 --> 02:45:12.682]  A scene.
[02:45:13.662 --> 02:45:20.867]  So, you know, every minute of film that you watch, there were people working about 500 hours to draw that.
[02:45:21.471 --> 02:45:26.232]  And that's because every frame they had to go paint over the actual footage.
[02:45:26.832 --> 02:45:31.393]  And so this isn't like Waking Life where it looks like people, but you can tell it's a cartoon.
[02:45:31.413 --> 02:45:34.134]  This is like, it gives it some type of dream feel.
[02:45:34.954 --> 02:45:40.495]  And I've talked to a lot of people who liked A Scanner Darkly when they first saw it, but then they saw it again, they liked it even more.
[02:45:40.815 --> 02:45:45.276]  Because the first time, when I, you know, avant-garde folks just mean something totally new, state of the art.
[02:45:45.636 --> 02:45:46.676]  This is avant-garde.
[02:45:47.396 --> 02:45:49.797]  I mean, because the subject matter,
[02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:56.613]  Uh, is, is, you know, not the standard kind of Hollywood fare, and then the rotoscoping is unlike anything you've ever seen.
[02:45:58.735 --> 02:45:59.255]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:46:00.236 --> 02:46:04.080]  Well, I mean, haven't, I mean, I know a lot of other reviewers have, have, have called it avant-garde.
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:06.162]  I mean, I think avant-garde puts it lightly.
[02:46:07.784 --> 02:46:15.471]  Yeah, you know, well, it's a challenging film, I think, on many different levels, but it's, it's, um, you know, to make it, it's a very satisfying film to make, and, um,
[02:46:15.902 --> 02:46:19.825]  You know, I do think that you're accurate in saying that there's really not another film like it.
[02:46:19.865 --> 02:46:26.451]  I mean, it's hard to point to another film and say, like, oh, well, it's like this, which was sort of the difficulty in trying to make it.
[02:46:26.871 --> 02:46:32.716]  And we were just fortunate enough to sort of have people to take that leap of faith with us and to let us, you know, make this film.
[02:46:32.836 --> 02:46:36.499]  And, you know, really what you're seeing truly is our vision.
[02:46:36.679 --> 02:46:39.081]  I mean, we had final cut on the film.
[02:46:39.101 --> 02:46:42.664]  So, you know, when you're asking earlier what it was like, you know, sort of dealing with the studio,
[02:46:43.171 --> 02:46:46.372]  In the end of the day, you know, it really is the film that we wanted to make.
[02:46:48.133 --> 02:46:54.915]  Well, that's just amazing to see you guys be able to get together and actually bring this to fruition.
[02:46:54.955 --> 02:46:59.796]  And I'm just proud that I was involved in any small way, consulting.
[02:46:59.836 --> 02:47:06.418]  But frankly, when I saw what you guys were planning, the research you'd already done for the surveillance system, I think I just added a few little touches.
[02:47:07.078 --> 02:47:12.360]  It's pretty darn accurate when it comes to really almost the current state
[02:47:13.335 --> 02:47:21.557]  of surveillance, but I think it really is a lens to show people how far we've gone and then how far we could go if we don't turn this around.
[02:47:21.577 --> 02:47:28.238]  A Scanner Darkly is in stores all over the country from Barnes and Nobles to Best Buy.
[02:47:28.258 --> 02:47:39.900]  Now don't run out too quickly here in Austin because I want to go get one today because I left it in the hotel room Sunday when I flew back out of Los Angeles because I want to watch it tonight with my wife after the little ones go to sleep.
[02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:45.105]  Uh, but everybody really should go out and get this film because it also supports more independent filmmaking.
[02:47:45.145 --> 02:47:51.532]  I mean, this was a film that was independently done with Final Cut and then distributed through Warner Brothers.
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:52.721]  Warner Independent.
[02:47:52.901 --> 02:47:54.502]  Yeah, Warner Independent.
[02:47:54.522 --> 02:47:59.106]  And it's important to support these type of revolutionary films.
[02:47:59.506 --> 02:48:05.491]  Talking to the Dick Estate now, talking to Keanu Reeves and others, are they happy with how it ended up?
[02:48:06.031 --> 02:48:06.752]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:48:06.932 --> 02:48:08.313]  I mean, everybody seems pretty pleased.
[02:48:08.533 --> 02:48:10.575]  I think that we delivered kind of what we promised.
[02:48:11.196 --> 02:48:12.276]  Well, they must be, Tommy.
[02:48:12.316 --> 02:48:13.317]  They want you to do more.
[02:48:13.337 --> 02:48:14.258]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:14.358 --> 02:48:19.162]  I'm talking to them about doing a live-action feature next, based on a book called Ubik.
[02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:21.264]  Which is a great book, by the way.
[02:48:22.483 --> 02:48:24.144]  I'll tell you, it's amazing.
[02:48:25.425 --> 02:48:33.049]  We probably shouldn't say much more about the director who might be doing it, but I'll just tell you that I'd love to see that live action.
[02:48:34.210 --> 02:48:35.311]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:35.931]  Final segment.
[02:48:35.971 --> 02:48:37.212]  We may even cram in a few calls.
[02:48:38.692 --> 02:48:41.534]  Here with Tommy Pallotta, a scanner darkly, in stores now.
[02:48:41.574 --> 02:48:42.395]  Get it at Amazon.com.
[02:48:48.516 --> 02:48:51.699]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.039 --> 02:48:53.981]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.341 --> 02:49:02.007]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.688 --> 02:49:09.733]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.133 --> 02:49:17.039]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[02:49:17.512 --> 02:49:21.535]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.855 --> 02:49:25.358]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.818 --> 02:49:27.719]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.079 --> 02:49:32.002]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:51.361 --> 02:51:53.122]  Hey, Scanner Darkly in stores now.
[02:51:53.302 --> 02:51:54.502]  So is Terror Storm.
[02:51:55.903 --> 02:51:58.644]  Though it's sold out and a lot of them didn't restock for some reason.
[02:51:59.204 --> 02:52:02.086]  But I know Scanner Darkly's in stores all over the country right now.
[02:52:02.726 --> 02:52:06.287]  Get it as a last minute gift and then say, oh by the way, here's a few news articles.
[02:52:06.688 --> 02:52:07.888]  A lot of this is already happening.
[02:52:07.908 --> 02:52:09.089]  I'm not going to give away the film.
[02:52:09.929 --> 02:52:10.509]  You need to get it.
[02:52:10.629 --> 02:52:11.710]  It's anti-New World Order.
[02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:16.852]  The entire cast, and I had a chance to talk to a lot of them, and the big stars are on board.
[02:52:17.532 --> 02:52:19.473]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:26.284]  Let's just take some calls, and pretty much any subject they mention will be the police state, so it ties into a scanner darkly.
[02:52:26.564 --> 02:52:28.205]  Tim in Ohio, then Dana.
[02:52:28.505 --> 02:52:29.305]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:52:29.686 --> 02:52:30.566]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:52:30.646 --> 02:52:31.206]  Hello, Tommy.
[02:52:31.507 --> 02:52:31.887]  Hello.
[02:52:32.347 --> 02:52:36.149]  Quickly, Merry Christmas to you and all the freedom-loving listeners on the GCN line.
[02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:42.573]  This is, once again, Tim from TRUTH, and that stands for Teaching and Researching United States Treasonous Hierarchy.
[02:52:43.073 --> 02:52:49.277]  I have a little trilogy that I try to bring up to people when we're dealing with these Dana-Bunaduchi types of the world that they're
[02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:51.800]  Number one, they're stunningly uninformed to the truth.
[02:52:52.260 --> 02:52:58.942]  They're completely arrogant when it comes to hearing the truth, and they're totally apathetic when it comes to accepting the truth.
[02:52:58.962 --> 02:52:59.863]  Now, check this out, Alex.
[02:53:00.883 --> 02:53:02.383]  The T-Rex, a political talk!
[02:53:03.044 --> 02:53:07.545]  I went out via TerrorStorm, and I got me a big-time bullhorn, just like you got.
[02:53:08.025 --> 02:53:09.926]  I went also to Radio Shack,
[02:53:10.293 --> 02:53:13.174]  And they have what are called RF modulators.
[02:53:13.194 --> 02:53:14.334]  You can take your DVD.
[02:53:14.734 --> 02:53:17.415]  It has three plugs for the RCA type.
[02:53:17.515 --> 02:53:18.595]  Two audio, one video.
[02:53:18.615 --> 02:53:18.815]  Sure.
[02:53:18.835 --> 02:53:19.315]  What do you do?
[02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:19.635]  Tell us.
[02:53:19.756 --> 02:53:20.636]  Well, you take it in.
[02:53:20.936 --> 02:53:24.037]  Then you can take it out to your VCR and you can make all big-time copies.
[02:53:24.097 --> 02:53:28.218]  I've recorded Terror Storm so many times I can almost recite it verbatim.
[02:53:28.298 --> 02:53:28.558]  Good.
[02:53:28.638 --> 02:53:29.418]  I appreciate you.
[02:53:29.438 --> 02:53:30.218]  We're out of time.
[02:53:30.578 --> 02:53:31.359]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:53:31.379 --> 02:53:32.039]  We'll have more time.
[02:53:32.259 --> 02:53:34.479]  Tommy, what about the alternative media rising?
[02:53:34.879 --> 02:53:36.340]  Mainline media starting to
[02:53:38.144 --> 02:53:39.605]  We've talked a lot about that privately.
[02:53:39.625 --> 02:53:40.445]  Does that excite you?
[02:53:41.266 --> 02:53:45.649]  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I think it's really an obligation of each individual to educate themselves.
[02:53:46.210 --> 02:53:50.813]  And I think with the internet primarily, there's never been a better time to do that.
[02:53:51.294 --> 02:53:57.999]  I mean, I think before when I was younger, I would just spend, you know, hours and hours in the library, you know, looking at newspapers from other countries.
[02:53:58.764 --> 02:54:10.193]  Trying to gain different perspectives, but now I can go to these different sites and you get several sources from the same news feed and from different countries and different perspectives.
[02:54:11.354 --> 02:54:12.775]  I just think it's a wonderful thing.
[02:54:12.815 --> 02:54:23.924]  I think all the podcasts are great, all the video transmissions on the internet are fantastic, and I just love the fact that your audience keeps on growing and these different voices can be heard now.
[02:54:25.484 --> 02:54:27.145]  What do you think the establishment is going to do?
[02:54:27.186 --> 02:54:28.607]  Are they going to give up their monopoly?
[02:54:28.647 --> 02:54:29.407]  Or what are they going to do?
[02:54:30.468 --> 02:54:33.791]  You know, I think that people in power never really want to relinquish control.
[02:54:34.652 --> 02:54:43.359]  And, you know, that people tend to try to do what they can do to maintain their status, no matter what area that is.
[02:54:43.679 --> 02:54:46.882]  And, you know, whether it's money or power or whatever.
[02:54:47.082 --> 02:54:50.745]  And, you know, I think what happens is that people, that there are these different cycles.
[02:54:51.686 --> 02:54:53.708]  And right now, you know, I'm fairly optimistic.
[02:54:54.255 --> 02:55:10.509]  About the way things are, and the thing that I was thinking the other day was really, like, there seems to be, I really do believe that people have power, and it's sort of a collective consciousness, or a synchronicity, or whatever, that we can actually affect the way things happen.
[02:55:11.250 --> 02:55:18.976]  And I think that we went through a really dark period the last five years, and I kind of feel like we are kind of on an upswing right now, and there seems to be momentum.
[02:55:19.377 --> 02:55:22.019]  And I feel much more positive about, you know, change happening.
[02:55:22.665 --> 02:55:23.505]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:55:23.525 --> 02:55:25.866]  There is a massive awakening taking place.
[02:55:26.387 --> 02:55:32.389]  And even when I go on big neocon talk shows, they go, well, we can't take calls because everybody agrees with this nut.
[02:55:32.969 --> 02:55:34.610]  And they take them and all the callers agree.
[02:55:34.650 --> 02:55:37.251]  So their fraud isn't selling anymore.
[02:55:37.351 --> 02:55:39.932]  Dana and all the other callers, I apologize.
[02:55:39.952 --> 02:55:40.792]  We'll get to you tomorrow.
[02:55:41.073 --> 02:55:41.913]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:42.959 --> 02:55:44.580]  Sometime this week in the next two shows.
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:45.521]  I won't have guests.
[02:55:45.541 --> 02:55:46.482]  We'll just take your calls.
[02:55:46.782 --> 02:55:47.803]  But we're out of time now.
[02:55:48.103 --> 02:55:51.745]  A Scanner Darkly on store shelves nationwide or you can get it at Amazon.com.
[02:55:51.765 --> 02:55:52.726]  A Scanner Darkly.
[02:55:53.366 --> 02:55:55.248]  Tommy, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:55:55.268 --> 02:55:56.849]  You can also go to Tommy's MySpace.
[02:55:57.189 --> 02:55:59.331]  You can go to Infowars.com and he's one of my friends.
[02:55:59.351 --> 02:56:02.913]  You can link over on my MySpace to him and say hi to Tommy there on his MySpace.
[02:56:03.253 --> 02:56:04.534]  Tommy, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:56:04.875 --> 02:56:05.215]  Thank you.
[02:56:05.996 --> 02:56:09.739]  You bet, and you're going to be hopefully in Austin sometime around the New Year, we can hook up again.
[02:56:10.199 --> 02:56:10.780]  Sounds good, man.
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:11.600]  I look forward to it.
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:12.661]  Thank you and take care.
[02:56:12.681 --> 02:56:16.364]  Yeah, he's got some really exciting projects coming up.
[02:56:16.524 --> 02:56:18.245]  I'm very excited about it.
[02:56:19.026 --> 02:56:20.367]  Alright, God bless you all.
[02:56:20.407 --> 02:56:22.088]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:22.108 --> 02:56:23.409]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:30.074]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
