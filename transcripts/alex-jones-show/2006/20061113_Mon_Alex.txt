[00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:06.114]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:07.835]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:09.656]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.116]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:12.757]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:17.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.701]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:37.639]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.666]  Thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition, the 13th day of November 2006.
[00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:48.568]  We'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:50.090]  He hasn't been on with us in a couple months.
[00:00:50.470 --> 00:01:00.178]  Paul Joseph Watson will be riding shotgun in the second hour with his world report from the prison planet, from England.
[00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:06.787]  And we'll also have wide open phones throughout the broadcast giving you a chance to respond to what you've witnessed with the election.
[00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:14.091]  Now there can be no doubt every major Democrat has gone public saying zero impeachment, zero investigations.
[00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:27.258]  Now they are going public and saying well we may reduce the troops or we're looking at five different scenarios from the independent Iraq working study group with James Baker.
[00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:33.990]  Which it's not independent, of course, and this is the same thing they've been doing for now two and a half years.
[00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:45.435]  Always saying, oh, we'll look in a few months at giving a date for withdrawal, or, oh, we're going to withdraw 10,000 troops, and then they never even withdraw them and actually add more.
[00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:46.676]  So they put it kind of into a
[00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:58.463]  A no man's land of debate and discussion while telling the people what they want to hear, while at the same time actually escalating the number of troops in the country.
[00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:02.545]  So you're welcome to chime in on this subject.
[00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:09.449]  Also, Wayne Madsen, who turned out to be a great source, is saying that Cheney could be next on the chopping block.
[00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.871]  We'll get into that report for you.
[00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:17.279]  But really, I want to focus in on Nancy Pelosi.
[00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:32.029]  I have a report here that her constituents in the San Francisco Bay Area have had a referendum and they've demanded that impeachment be launched, but the problem is Nancy Pelosi is on the payroll of a bunch of foreign lobbies.
[00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:35.858]  And has said that she's not even going to criticize China.
[00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.239]  She's not going to criticize Israel.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.960]  The war is going to continue.
[00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.781]  There will be no impeachment.
[00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:44.862]  I mean, of course, you're aware of what's happening.
[00:02:44.882 --> 00:03:02.289]  I want to give you a chance to respond on air and give us your take on any ideas that you have on ways to force the Democrats to move forward with impeachment of George W. Bush and the criminal neocons that are still running this country.
[00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:05.080]  They're still in control for another two years.
[00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.664]  The Democrats have said we're not going to repeal the Patriot Act.
[00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:11.747]  There's no discussion of repealing H.R.
[00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:11.747]  6166.
[00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.430]  Finally, Lou Rockwell's pointing this out.
[00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:17.873]  I thought we were the only people that noticed this.
[00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:24.760]  So the question is, will the country go back to sleep, or will there be a mass
[00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:33.510]  energizing against what the Democratic Party is doing, circling the wagons with the Republicans.
[00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.052]  The question is, how do we force impeachment?
[00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:41.575]  How do we force repeals of these abominable acts, of these enabling acts?
[00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:46.478]  And then another important question for the listeners that I'd like to get your take on,
[00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:53.382]  What comes in the future if we don't impeach Bush, if we don't punish the neocon allies in the Democratic Party?
[00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:55.404]  Will they attack Iran?
[00:03:55.484 --> 00:03:57.206]  Israel is saying they may do it any day.
[00:03:57.527 --> 00:04:00.570]  They're talking about going into Lebanon again, even going into Syria.
[00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.493]  This is in Haraj, this is in the Jerusalem Post.
[00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:08.079]  What's going to happen when we have Lieberman running the homeland security
[00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:10.496]  Committee in the Senate.
[00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:16.479]  What's going to happen when we have all these war hawk Democrats in control of key committees?
[00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:25.524]  Really, Bush has now defended himself against his weak flank that was some real conservative members of the House of Representatives.
[00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:37.250]  And of course, there's the big nightmare looming, not even on the horizon, but starting up in the new Congress in the next legislative session in January, and that is blanket
[00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:39.956]  Total Amnesty.
[00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:42.457]  That is the guest worker program.
[00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:44.077]  So we're going to go to break here in just a moment.
[00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:54.741]  And when we get back, we will go to your phone calls and break down the state of the world, the state of the economy, and much more.
[00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:55.721]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:56.082 --> 00:04:59.043]  The websites are JonesReport.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:04:59.303 --> 00:04:59.783]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.626]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:17.637]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.314 --> 00:05:25.378]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:37.184]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.006]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:43.388]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:47.570]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.295]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:14.542]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:14.802 --> 00:06:21.848]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:22.949]  We're good to go!
[00:06:49.207 --> 00:06:49.547]  We're good.
[00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:07.851]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:13.032]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:16.033]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:19.934]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:25.036]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.456 --> 00:07:28.637]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:32.098]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:32.876 --> 00:07:35.017]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:35.057 --> 00:07:37.157]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:37.177 --> 00:07:37.517]  U.S.
[00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:39.238]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:39.558]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:40.458]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:40.999]  Ask for George.
[00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:06.039]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:07.779]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.580]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.040]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:12.861]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:17.302]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:21.624]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:48.357]  In past decades, the New World Order overlords that control our private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve, controlled the dominant committee chairmen and women in the House and Senate.
[00:08:48.397 --> 00:08:49.838]  They controlled most of the governors.
[00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.679]  They always controlled the President.
[00:08:52.319 --> 00:09:01.185]  Many Presidents before Kennedy and all Presidents after John F. Kennedy was killed in Dallas, Texas, coming up on the 43rd anniversary here pretty quick.
[00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.794]  Seems like just like yesterday, but that we had the last anniversary.
[00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:20.107]  So all of this is swarming around, all of this is, all these current events are happening, but to put them into perspective,
[00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:42.769]  In 1994, the Republican Party came to power and there were real independent conservatives that came in as part of that sweeper landslide with all the discontent with Bill Clinton and a socialist health care plan, Bill Clinton and Waco, Bill Clinton and of course his gun control actions.
[00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:45.135]  And so the Republicans came into power.
[00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:50.943]  Newt Gingrich then basically was put into a position to ride herd over them.
[00:09:50.963 --> 00:10:00.056]  And then by 1998, still some of those conservative elements in the House responding to the huge national
[00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:16.114]  lobbying effort from the grassroots to impeach Bill Clinton did successfully get the House to vote for impeachment proceedings in the Senate but then they were dead on arrival in the Senate and the neocons did a great job also with their inside man
[00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:45.678]  The Special Counsel, Special Investigator, Special Prosecutor, Kenneth Starb, they were able to ensure that nuclear reactor transfers by Clinton weren't investigated, missile secrets, missile components, MIRV technology, that's the Multiple Reentry Device technology, so that a warhead coming into the atmosphere, or that is the third stage of a Long March rocket, can pop open and fire dozens of different missiles and decoys,
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:11:04.526]  The point is, they weren't allowed to go after Clinton on any real issue because Kenneth Starr, through David Shippers and others, only brought forward something that was
[00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:06.902]  Individualized.
[00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:16.805]  Something that was localized only to Bill Clinton, and that was having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
[00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:19.066]  Alright?
[00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:24.007]  And again, before I get into the latest news, it's important to go back and look at what happened.
[00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:26.328]  So that scared the establishment.
[00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:44.581]  And as soon as George Bush got in office in 2001, continuing his father's administration, starting his father's fifth administration, because his father was the real president in both Reagan administrations, his administration, of course, and then in both of Bill Clinton's administrations,
[00:11:45.490 --> 00:12:01.179]  As soon as George Herbert Walker Bush started his fifth administration through his front man, his son, his puppet, in 2001, the first thing they did was block Dan Burton's committee that was going after Bill Clinton.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.221]  We had Bill Clinton dead to rights.
[00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:11.766]  We had him caught red-handed pardoning scores of convicted cocaine dealers, money launderers,
[00:12:13.827 --> 00:12:19.869]  Just people involved in arms smuggling, felons, Chinese generals in the White House, you know the drill.
[00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.650]  And so that all just disappeared.
[00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.931]  George Bush, day one, said, we're not going to have any investigations.
[00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.932]  Just like Nancy Pelosi today is saying, no investigations.
[00:12:28.992 --> 00:12:31.353]  And the Republicans howled in anger.
[00:12:31.393 --> 00:12:36.295]  That is the Republican faithful, the grassroots, the backbone of this country, well-meaning people.
[00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:46.779]  And now, well-meaning liberals are howling in disgust, demanding an investigation, demanding an impeachment, demanding a repeal of the Patriot Act, and H.R.
[00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:54.422]  6166, and the Military Commissions Act, and the Defense Authorization Act of 2007, that sets up a military dictatorship publicly.
[00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:55.622]  I mean, NORTHCOM's announced it.
[00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.216]  And we cannot let this fade away like we did in 2001.
[00:13:02.637 --> 00:13:06.322]  So many Republicans were glassy-eyed in rapture.
[00:13:06.342 --> 00:13:13.713]  They were angry about Bush protecting Clinton, but they said, well, at least he's in control now, and he's just trying to work with Clinton.
[00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:27.751]  I don't think that the progressives, the liberals, the third force in this country that is made up of the Reagan Democrats and others are going to put up with this this time.
[00:13:29.152 --> 00:13:34.014]  And I am really trying to get everybody focused right now on several issues.
[00:13:34.034 --> 00:13:44.720]  9-11 Truth is the event that all of the modern actions playing out under New World Order programs orbit.
[00:13:45.686 --> 00:14:04.658]  And we need to attack their foundation and expose the fact that, and they always go back to 9-11, you know, they've got this Draft Giuliani move now, drafting the president, and the ads they're running on radio and TV across the country are saying, he saved us, he's our leader, the man we went to, the man that led us through the darkness on 9-11.
[00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:06.419]  I mean, it's so rich, it's sick.
[00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:12.263]  Here's somebody involved in the attacks and I have to hear ads about how he, I heard it last night about how he's saving us.
[00:14:13.783 --> 00:14:15.464]  So again, it's their zeitgeist.
[00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:19.567]  They continue to go back to 9-11 and use that as the excuse for everything they do.
[00:14:20.968 --> 00:14:35.378]  We also have to move to repeal the Military Commissions Act, to repeal the Defense Authorization Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, to repeal Patriot Act 1 and 1.5, because they didn't fully get 2 passed last year, so I call it 1.5.
[00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:41.728]  We have to continue to make this the central issue and not let the country go back to sleep.
[00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:44.090]  But the good news is they're not going back to sleep.
[00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:47.152]  There's a lot of partisan pundants.
[00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.373]  I was listening to Beyond the Beltway last night.
[00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:59.860]  I finished my own, the new radio show I'm doing, Sundays from 4 to 6, that we syndicated out of the studios of News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:15:01.847 --> 00:15:08.496]  And I was driving to actually go to a circus with family and friends, a little local circus here in town.
[00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:12.001]  It's really an acrobat circus, but I'm already digressing.
[00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:17.809]  And so I had about 45 minutes in traffic to listen to Beyond the Beltway.
[00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:22.001]  It's a syndicated show out of Chicago.
[00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:22.943]  Many of you probably heard it.
[00:15:23.663 --> 00:15:26.867]  And the Democrat analyst had it right on the show.
[00:15:26.907 --> 00:15:30.472]  He was saying, listen, people don't like either party now.
[00:15:31.112 --> 00:15:32.534]  It is a third force.
[00:15:33.355 --> 00:15:34.817]  They're against global government.
[00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.633]  They're against the New World Order.
[00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:58.998]  They don't like either party, and I'm telling you that in 2008, if the Democrats haven't gotten us out of Iraq and haven't stopped the North American Union and a lot of other things, they're going to get thrown out too, and you're going to see a real third party, not like 94, 96, or 98, or 2000, you know, these ineffectual things.
[00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:00.418]  You're going to see a real one.
[00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:11.203]  And then I tuned in when I was leaving the circus last night to Matt Drudge driving home, and he had Pat Buchanan sing the exact same thing.
[00:16:11.644 --> 00:16:18.608]  Third force, anti-New World Order, anti-North American Union, both parties have circled the wagons against the people.
[00:16:19.654 --> 00:16:27.358]  And it's encouraging, folks, when Limbaugh's having to say that he carried the water, that he lied to people, telling you that Republicans were good.
[00:16:27.818 --> 00:16:31.060]  It's encouraging when top Democratic strategists are admitting it.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.482]  It's encouraging when even Matt Drudge is having to admit it.
[00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:38.404]  And that's because if they don't admit it, they're losing their entire audiences.
[00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:45.287]  Matt Drudge is having to admit there's a world government and that he doesn't like it, at least he's having to say that, because we have achieved
[00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:50.153]  I don't want to use the corny New Age term, Enlightenment.
[00:16:51.014 --> 00:16:53.616]  Eighty-plus percent of the country now knows the game.
[00:16:53.876 --> 00:17:01.523]  They know enough of the rules, they know enough of the basics to see how the scam's working, and this is incredibly positive news.
[00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:03.465]  Amazingly positive.
[00:17:03.485 --> 00:17:09.670]  I mean, I got a little bit down last week and was pouting on air, and for that I apologize, just because I knew the Democrats would sell out.
[00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:11.372]  I threw a fit over it.
[00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:13.574]  I just thought they'd at least give us lip service.
[00:17:14.094 --> 00:17:24.348]  But the fact that they didn't even give us lip service, the fact that they just threw down the gauntlet and said, we don't care, really energized the population and kept the people from going back to sleep.
[00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.776]  And now to hear all these top pundits admitting that they've lost control is really exciting.
[00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:46.854]  So of course you see Nancy Pelosi and John Conyers in that bug-eyed twerp, Howard Dean, basically circling the wagons, closing the drawbridge, huddled with Bush and the rest of those criminals, trying to defend the status quo.
[00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:51.258]  They've got a tiger by the tail, and they're not going to be able to do it.
[00:17:52.499 --> 00:17:56.243]  They're not going to be able to just ride out the next two years and whatever shenanigans they're planning.
[00:17:57.803 --> 00:18:00.485]  And by the way, I think they could stage a terror attack any time.
[00:18:00.585 --> 00:18:01.685]  We are not out of the woods.
[00:18:03.146 --> 00:18:07.749]  They're now putting out alerts that Al-Qaeda, Al-Ci8 has called back in their fighters from the U.S.
[00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:10.090]  and England, and they're about to strike us any minute.
[00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.091]  Give up all your rights.
[00:18:11.471 --> 00:18:13.392]  Worship the nearest man in a black uniform.
[00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:17.815]  I mean, it's really getting to be transparent right now.
[00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:27.993]  But the good news is, the establishment is having to admit that they are totally discredited and they're not trusted.
[00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:37.761]  And now, the first three or four days, the Democrats were, that is the Democratic constituents, were a little bit childlike and delusional.
[00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:46.167]  They were criticizing myself and others saying, oh, you don't worry, Conyers and Dean and them are just saying that everything's okay.
[00:18:46.707 --> 00:18:49.328]  Now they're beginning to become horrified.
[00:18:49.348 --> 00:18:58.050]  Now they're beginning to grow up a little bit and they are setting about to try to force their party to move forward with impeachment.
[00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:04.131]  Now, let me just briefly comment on Iraq and we'll come back and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:19.794]  They have this Iraq study group with a bunch of top establishment Democrats and Republicans, chaired by James Baker, the Bush and Saudi lawyer, the chief whitewasher.
[00:19:19.814 --> 00:19:25.736]  I mean, this guy is as powerful as George Sulz, and more powerful than Henry Kissinger.
[00:19:26.076 --> 00:19:31.337]  A top gopher for the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Sachs-Coburt, Gothers, and the Dutch Royal Family.
[00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.318]  Works directly for all of them.
[00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:37.152]  Well, we'll tell you about what he's doing briefly on the other side.
[00:19:37.472 --> 00:19:42.113]  There's big talk about Dick Cheney being forced to move out of office.
[00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.933]  I don't know if that's the case, but it could happen.
[00:19:45.313 --> 00:19:47.234]  The guy's already basically on life support.
[00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:48.214]  He's like Darth Vader.
[00:19:49.494 --> 00:19:54.315]  And we'll continue with your calls when we start taking those.
[00:19:54.815 --> 00:19:55.715]  So stay with us.
[00:19:56.255 --> 00:19:58.896]  JonesReport.com, Pleasant Planet.com are the websites.

[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.403]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[00:21:09.983 --> 00:21:15.606]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[00:21:16.206 --> 00:21:22.330]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?

[00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:03.557]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:22:03.897 --> 00:22:05.418]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:06.078]  What?
[00:22:06.438 --> 00:22:06.799]  Again?
[00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:08.840]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.342]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:14.862]  Why did you do that?
[00:22:15.063 --> 00:22:20.865]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:22:21.166 --> 00:22:22.186]  Are we there yet?
[00:22:22.286 --> 00:22:23.367]  for the entire trip.
[00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:25.808]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:22:26.288 --> 00:22:27.309]  Great idea.
[00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:30.150]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:22:30.535 --> 00:22:37.586]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:22:37.866 --> 00:22:38.187]  Honey!
[00:22:39.013 --> 00:22:40.253]  You're terrific!
[00:22:40.634 --> 00:22:42.134]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:22:42.234 --> 00:22:45.655]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:22:45.936 --> 00:22:46.716]  Now can we stop?
[00:22:47.216 --> 00:22:47.956]  I need to go, too.

[00:24:15.736 --> 00:24:16.676]  Central Standard Time.
[00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:17.636]  We're here, my friends.
[00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:18.576]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:21.257 --> 00:24:24.417]  Alright, I want to get to Tonto, Fred, Troy, Mike, and others.
[00:24:26.878 --> 00:24:30.339]  But before we do that, just finishing up, and I'm going to get more into this later.
[00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:36.620]  We have the Iraq Study Group.
[00:24:38.530 --> 00:25:00.983]  Which the media keeps going, well, I'm glad they're here, they'll fix it all, and the ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN, liberals, conservatives, it doesn't matter, the establishment talking heads are all saying, oh, they're non-partisan, oh, they'll fix it, oh, Bush has gotten a spanking, his daddy's back into control.
[00:25:02.364 --> 00:25:03.885]  And that's why you know they are the
[00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.191]  We're good to go.
[00:25:27.452 --> 00:25:28.632]  Robert Gates and others.
[00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:31.993]  I mean, they were involved in the crimes of Iran-Contra and covering it up.
[00:25:32.554 --> 00:25:34.574]  Involved in all of the corruption.
[00:25:35.694 --> 00:25:36.935]  Just unbelievable stuff.
[00:25:36.975 --> 00:25:39.516]  BCCI, arming Saddam.
[00:25:39.596 --> 00:25:41.816]  I mean, these guys just never stop.
[00:25:42.897 --> 00:25:43.537]  And they're back!
[00:25:44.357 --> 00:25:45.997]  They were there stealing the election in 2000.
[00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:47.558]  Well, they're back again!
[00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:51.839]  And the media is calling them independent.
[00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:54.040]  I mean, that is so laughable.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.680]  That's like when
[00:25:56.002 --> 00:26:09.113]  Janet Reno appointed former Senator John Danforth from Missouri, and then her two deputies, the two top people that aided Danforth were her two top deputies.
[00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:13.597]  Now one of them, you know, is Congressman Michael McCaul, the big conservative.
[00:26:14.257 --> 00:26:17.119]  Bill Clinton and Janet Reno's top right-hand man.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.061]  Again, it's a nest.
[00:26:19.942 --> 00:26:23.725]  We can prove that Bill Clinton is a CIA operative on the take,
[00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:31.936]  Recruited, trained in the late sixties, working for Bush Senior, who was CIA director later, and then of course head ambassador to China.
[00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:35.398]  I mean, this is a management team for the globalists.
[00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:36.139]  Period.
[00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:38.340]  And now, it's more obvious than ever.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.122]  And what is the Iraq study group recommending?
[00:26:42.222 --> 00:26:44.043]  Oh, they've got five different plans.
[00:26:45.945 --> 00:26:47.766]  Two of the plans are the most likely.
[00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.987]  That was the original Israeli and Pentagon plan.
[00:26:51.132 --> 00:27:03.039]  Back in 1983, the Israelis wrote it up, and then it was immediately adopted by the Pentagon as the main battle plan to destabilize and balkanize and divide and conquer the region.
[00:27:03.879 --> 00:27:07.061]  And one plan is to break it up into four parts, the other is into three parts.
[00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:10.823]  So, two of the five plans are really the same plan.
[00:27:11.163 --> 00:27:13.845]  And those are the plans that you'll see carried out.
[00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:20.169]  Predominantly, because really what these guys always do is have a mismatch.
[00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.051]  Then one of the other plans is to actually build up troops, increase the troops.
[00:27:25.691 --> 00:27:28.372]  That's the program they've been carrying out for the last two and a half years.
[00:27:28.512 --> 00:27:36.054]  Remember two and a half years ago every month we heard the mantra, oh we're going to be pulling out now down to 50,000 troops, 40,000 troops in the next year.
[00:27:36.435 --> 00:27:38.975]  But first we've got to stabilize it by going from 35,000 to 64,000.
[00:27:41.252 --> 00:27:45.761]  And then down to 150, and then back up to 165, and then back down to 130, and back down to... When in truth, there's never been less than 150,000 troops in country.
[00:27:52.012 --> 00:28:00.439]  And so they just claim that they're listening to the people and are going to end the war, and then they just every month have a new meeting, a new debate, a new discussion.
[00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:08.886]  But don't worry, down the line, when the 30-plus permanent structures, one of them costing, what, $2 billion, holds 3,000 people, a giant armored compound,
[00:28:12.606 --> 00:28:23.115]  And every major town and city has these, and they're just there to make sure the infighting and mass murder and bombing continues, that the bedlam continues.
[00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:23.835]  And that was the plan.
[00:28:24.155 --> 00:28:35.885]  Go in, blow out the first world economy, balkanize it, and then just guard the pipelines to ensure that oil does not flow, therefore jacking up prices.
[00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:40.929]  You see, by shutting off that oil and restricting its flow, the oil companies make record profits.
[00:28:41.449 --> 00:29:00.486]  And so the oil companies let Bush and the neocons take the blame, and now the higher-level folks that are just as neocon, if you want to use that term, but the Rockefeller Republican types, they now, quote, come in and fix everything with the very crew they engineered and put in power.
[00:29:00.907 --> 00:29:04.450]  And so when you read a New York Times article or you read a Reuters story,
[00:29:05.518 --> 00:29:09.181]  Democrats push for troop cuts within months, four to six months.
[00:29:09.221 --> 00:29:10.922]  Democrats who've won majorities in the U.S.
[00:29:10.962 --> 00:29:15.986]  Congress in the last week's elections said on Sunday they will push for a phased withdrawal of U.S.
[00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:18.408]  troops from Iraq to begin in four to six months.
[00:29:18.448 --> 00:29:20.209]  And in four to six months, you would have forgotten.
[00:29:20.249 --> 00:29:27.215]  It's like Bush saying, oh, I'm going to phase in 6,000 troops on the southern border over the next four to six months.
[00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:29.288]  And nothing ever happens.
[00:29:29.328 --> 00:29:33.071]  They put a few hundred troops down there for one or two photo ops and nothing's done.
[00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:34.292]  Same thing with a fence.
[00:29:34.652 --> 00:29:36.453]  They didn't pass a bill to fund a fence.
[00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:38.755]  They passed a bill to allow a fence!
[00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:40.196]  Ha ha!
[00:29:41.197 --> 00:29:42.178]  Yeah, yeah.

[00:32:00.973 --> 00:32:05.757]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:32:05.977 --> 00:32:09.961]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:32:10.221 --> 00:32:16.526]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[00:33:03.912 --> 00:33:09.937]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:09.957 --> 00:33:13.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.531 --> 00:33:19.358]  The bad news is both parties are totally controlled.
[00:33:19.378 --> 00:33:24.109]  Anyone who's anti-establishment, Democrat or Republican, is targeted by the machine.
[00:33:24.229 --> 00:33:24.831]  We know that.
[00:33:26.194 --> 00:33:41.481]  Most of us have known that for decades, but the good news now is that the general public is awake to that, and I heard Beyond the Beltway, Matt Drudge, I mean, just listening to talk radio last night, everyone admitting that it's an anti-New World Order.
[00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:46.844]  I heard that term used, not just by Pat Buchanan, but on the Beyond the Beltway show.
[00:33:47.904 --> 00:33:49.425]  An anti-globalist sentiment.
[00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:56.692]  They're having to admit the majority of Americans now don't trust anything they say and are, quote, anti-New World Order.
[00:33:56.992 --> 00:33:57.694]  It's happened, folks.
[00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.138]  We are now mainstream.
[00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:03.081]  We've always been the normal people.
[00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:04.182]  We want our country.
[00:34:04.502 --> 00:34:05.383]  We want our borders.
[00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:06.784]  We want our Second Amendment.
[00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.785]  We want our families.
[00:34:08.106 --> 00:34:09.327]  We want our sovereignty.
[00:34:10.288 --> 00:34:16.714]  Paleo-conservatives have always known that big government is a tool of big corporations used to extract our wealth.
[00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:18.655]  The liberals never understood that.
[00:34:18.735 --> 00:34:21.118]  Grassroots liberals thought big government was for the people.
[00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:26.723]  Now grassroots liberals, who are good folks who I talk to and whose blogs I read, now get it.
[00:34:27.243 --> 00:34:31.384]  Their understanding that big government is a tool of the global elite.
[00:34:31.984 --> 00:34:37.585]  And so the entire welfare state paradigm, everything they've built, is starting to fall apart.
[00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:45.187]  Doesn't mean we're out of the woods, but again, I study this, I look at this, this is complex issues.
[00:34:45.687 --> 00:34:51.708]  And so, you know, I was getting a little depressed last week because I saw the traitors, the Democrats, saying they were going to do nothing to go after this
[00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:57.636]  This man who would be king, this man who is trying to be a dictator, openly!
[00:34:58.437 --> 00:35:03.242]  But it's one thing to say our Bill of Rights is dead, it's another thing for them to actually implement that.
[00:35:03.962 --> 00:35:07.947]  It's one thing for them to claim they've got this power, it's another thing to actually use it.
[00:35:09.628 --> 00:35:12.712]  So we stand against the New World Order, you stand against them.
[00:35:13.012 --> 00:35:13.753]  Let's go to Karl's.
[00:35:14.723 --> 00:35:17.964]  I'm guessing that Troy in West Virginia disagrees, so I'm going to put him at the head of the line.
[00:35:18.564 --> 00:35:24.026]  And I was having a debate with a friend Friday night when we had a showing of Terror Storm for free at a local church.
[00:35:25.307 --> 00:35:32.989]  And my friend was thinking that Troy really is a patriot and is just acting ignorant.
[00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.111]  But he is, he's a great actor.
[00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:39.432]  Troy's called in, I guess, two or three times in the last few weeks.
[00:35:40.312 --> 00:35:43.133]  Troy, are you joking when you call and say you disagree?
[00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.970]  No.
[00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:49.677]  Okay, well I don't have a lot of time to waste with you because... Alright, I just have a simple question.
[00:35:49.697 --> 00:35:50.918]  I wasn't going to take up much of your time.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:52.941]  Okay, go ahead!
[00:35:54.023 --> 00:36:01.453]  We've made it clear that you want Bush impeached, but my question to you is, if Bush were to be impeached, wouldn't Cheney be the new president?
[00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:14.778]  Well, obviously, if there is an impeachment process, it's going to destroy his whole administration, and they're all going to have to leave, you know, just like when Nixon left, his Vice President got indicted.
[00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:18.741]  So the Vice President wasn't President when Nixon got impeached?
[00:36:19.822 --> 00:36:20.202]  Pardon me?
[00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:30.750]  See, I have trouble talking to you, sir, because I don't, it's like, I'm not that smart, but talking to you, it's like talking to another life form.
[00:36:32.186 --> 00:36:33.767]  Listen, I don't understand what you just said.
[00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:37.368]  Who was Nixon's vice president?
[00:36:37.488 --> 00:36:38.308]  Spiro Agnew.
[00:36:38.328 --> 00:36:39.569]  Oh, okay, I didn't know that.
[00:36:39.609 --> 00:36:46.211]  Was that some little smart, smart comment you made about, you know, oh, so Cheney was president?
[00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:47.051]  I mean, what are you saying?
[00:36:47.832 --> 00:36:49.212]  I just asked you a simple question.
[00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:49.992]  I didn't know that.
[00:36:50.012 --> 00:36:50.993]  I just assumed that when the...
[00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:55.236]  If something happens to the President, the Vice President becomes President, right?
[00:36:55.256 --> 00:37:03.420]  If the President has a heart attack, or has a stroke on a train like Woodrow Wilson and dies, then the Vice President becomes President.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:12.524]  But no, if a President's removed for corruption, like Grant or somebody, their Vice President doesn't usually hang around long.
[00:37:12.984 --> 00:37:13.784]  Okay, I didn't know that.
[00:37:14.085 --> 00:37:14.705]  That's all I needed.
[00:37:14.725 --> 00:37:17.566]  Okay, but you've called in disagreeing before.
[00:37:18.426 --> 00:37:18.807]  Okay?
[00:37:19.107 --> 00:37:20.167]  So I'm trying to understand.
[00:37:20.207 --> 00:37:21.928]  Are you against impeaching George Bush?
[00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:24.201]  I'm a Republican, so yeah.
[00:37:25.382 --> 00:37:27.983]  So you don't think he lied about WMDs?
[00:37:29.703 --> 00:37:30.523]  I didn't want to argue.
[00:37:31.164 --> 00:37:34.985]  I just think he had bad information, that's all.
[00:37:35.325 --> 00:37:40.867]  Do you know about the White House memo where they premeditatedly talk about staging the discovery?
[00:37:44.168 --> 00:37:47.049]  I don't remember, no.
[00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.470]  Is this a joke?
[00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:54.942]  No, it's not a joke.
[00:37:54.962 --> 00:37:57.824]  I didn't call in to discuss that with ASIC about the Vice President.
[00:37:57.864 --> 00:38:03.589]  No, but I'm trying to figure out with you because, I mean, are you trying to call in to make me look good or something?
[00:38:04.569 --> 00:38:05.010]  No.
[00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.814]  Well, no, because, I mean, people are now debating and thinking that you're a fake caller.
[00:38:10.314 --> 00:38:14.437]  One person accused me of you being my cousin and calling in with staged phone calls.
[00:38:14.718 --> 00:38:16.959]  No, ladies and gentlemen, he must be real.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.861]  I'm not proving to you that I'm real or them.
[00:38:18.881 --> 00:38:20.082]  I don't know how to prove it to them.
[00:38:20.854 --> 00:38:29.584]  Well, I just think they're so amazed, and I'm not being sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek here, they're so amazed by your ignorance, your willful ignorance, that they think you must be a fake caller.
[00:38:30.124 --> 00:38:32.207]  Well, I'm trying to learn, I guess.
[00:38:33.068 --> 00:38:34.529]  Well, I'm glad you're here.
[00:38:34.549 --> 00:38:38.213]  You're the only radio show I listen to, so I don't really listen to radio shows.
[00:38:38.273 --> 00:38:39.595]  Okay, see, there's the quandary.
[00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:44.386]  Because, you know, there's the enigma or the... Why do I listen to you?
[00:38:44.746 --> 00:38:48.027]  Yeah, I mean, there's the... Yeah, that's what people are having trouble understanding.
[00:38:48.307 --> 00:38:49.027]  That's the riddle.
[00:38:49.488 --> 00:38:53.429]  How could you listen to this show all the time and then think I'm a liar?
[00:38:53.469 --> 00:38:55.009]  Because you've called in and called me a liar before.
[00:38:55.029 --> 00:38:56.990]  I probably shouldn't have said it like that.
[00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.510]  I regret doing that.
[00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:59.510]  I think you're joking.
[00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.871]  I don't think you're serious.
[00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:02.151]  That you're a liar?
[00:39:02.851 --> 00:39:04.032]  No, I think this is a setup.
[00:39:04.332 --> 00:39:05.212]  A setup for what?
[00:39:07.205 --> 00:39:11.328]  I don't think you can routinely listen to this show and be as ignorant as you say... How long have I been listening?
[00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:12.588]  Okay, I've been listening probably for a month.
[00:39:12.628 --> 00:39:13.249]  Just a month.
[00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:14.529]  Oh, okay, I understand now.
[00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.511]  Well, okay, are you starting to come around?
[00:39:16.531 --> 00:39:21.293]  Not yet, but it might take some time.
[00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:23.315]  Okay, I appreciate your call, Troy.
[00:39:23.335 --> 00:39:24.815]  I want to get to other people here.
[00:39:24.836 --> 00:39:31.239]  Uh, yeah, Jack Blood was at the event Friday night, and he goes, oh, that's your cousin, that stage.
[00:39:31.259 --> 00:39:32.240]  And I said, no, it's not.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.682]  I said, that guy may be putting an act on, but I don't know him.
[00:39:37.857 --> 00:39:38.317]  Who knows?
[00:39:38.838 --> 00:39:40.199]  Uh, Tonto in Texas.
[00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:41.219]  Tonto, you're on the air.
[00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:41.620]  Go ahead.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.701]  Hey, how you doing there?
[00:39:44.221 --> 00:39:45.922]  Glad to have... I'll be a first-time caller.
[00:39:46.162 --> 00:39:47.403]  Good to have you on board, Tonto.
[00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:49.405]  How's the Lone Ranger doing, Kimo Sabe?
[00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:52.427]  Oh, he's got me cleaning up horse droppings right now.
[00:39:52.487 --> 00:39:54.188]  I'm just trying to, you know, get past that.
[00:39:55.188 --> 00:39:55.769]  Okay.
[00:39:56.389 --> 00:39:56.909]  Here's the deal.
[00:39:56.929 --> 00:40:03.193]  A couple of weeks ago, the Republicans were all celebrating, oh, we're going to have a big Republican suite.
[00:40:03.574 --> 00:40:04.214]  We're going to win.
[00:40:04.234 --> 00:40:04.834]  Well, you know what?
[00:40:05.175 --> 00:40:06.095]  They won anyway.
[00:40:06.395 --> 00:40:07.076]  They got their way.
[00:40:07.904 --> 00:40:10.346]  And I just want to know one question and then give you one more comment.
[00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:16.411]  How many of the new Congress and the Senate voted for all this legislation?
[00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:18.453]  Voted for the military commissions?
[00:40:18.473 --> 00:40:19.253]  How many are left?
[00:40:19.814 --> 00:40:21.815]  The vast majority voted for all of it.
[00:40:22.356 --> 00:40:23.497]  Yeah, great.
[00:40:23.717 --> 00:40:24.998]  We're in great shape, aren't we?
[00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:27.100]  But here's one thing I just noticed.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:35.947]  Of all of our stuff that we've been going through, you and all the videos I've seen, there's one person out of this whole bunch who to me is the most susceptible
[00:40:36.505 --> 00:40:38.986]  Who benefited from this, and that's Larry Silverstein.
[00:40:39.426 --> 00:40:49.429]  And I wish all the energy of all of the New World Order, the 9-11 Truth, would just focus on this one guy his entire life, because as far as I'm concerned, he'll break before the rest.
[00:40:49.629 --> 00:41:01.533]  Well, we brought Larry Silverstein out here on air within weeks of the attack, and we really put the whole Building 7 issue on the map, and we've been attempting to do that, and I appreciate your call.
[00:41:03.054 --> 00:41:04.314]  But this is what tends to happen.
[00:41:05.265 --> 00:41:27.132]  People look at the gold under one of the towers, billions of dollars confirmed, or people look at trillions in oil, or hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contracts, or hundreds of billions a year in opium in Afghanistan, or CIA insider trading, and they say, it was the CIA insider trading, that's why they did 9-11, or it was so they could get 7.3 billion dollar payout,
[00:41:29.573 --> 00:41:53.110]  on a hundred and ninety seven million dollar investment on the World Trade Center complex two months before 9-11 by the owner Larry Silverstein or it was so they could invade Iraq or it was so they could help Israel or it was so they could anything the globalists do goes through a complex cost-benefit analysis and if it helps a bunch of their interest
[00:41:54.622 --> 00:42:00.023]  It harms very few, and if they think they can get away with it, they will implement it.
[00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:01.603]  They will launch the attack.
[00:42:02.804 --> 00:42:04.244]  And that's what happened on 9-11.
[00:42:05.764 --> 00:42:18.887]  Obviously, when they're picking a prominent landmark to blow up, to attack, to have a big media event, they're going to pick a major city, they're going to pick a major landmark, and they're going to pick a landmark they control.
[00:42:19.736 --> 00:42:33.944]  So you had the Port Authority in a public-private partnership where the Rockefellers don't put up any money and they made the tens of billions in profit off of developing that lower Manhattan swampland right there by the edge of the Hudson.
[00:42:35.745 --> 00:42:36.045]  Okay?
[00:42:39.487 --> 00:42:41.128]  And so that's what happened.
[00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:45.110]  And
[00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:53.876]  It wasn't good enough to have just the government in control, because there were too many government workers, and every worker at the Port Authority wasn't, hey, let's blow up buildings and kill people.
[00:42:54.176 --> 00:42:59.940]  They had to then give control over to Larry Silverstein, who already owned Building 7.
[00:43:00.961 --> 00:43:02.722]  That was the only building he owned.
[00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:03.363]  He built it.
[00:43:03.763 --> 00:43:04.724]  He built the building.
[00:43:06.087 --> 00:43:08.990]  And so he owned that building, and he was in deep with the government.
[00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:18.638]  The evidence has been in the news that he's connected to a lot of money laundering and a lot of underworld characters involved with smack, you know, junk.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.624]  And so he's this underworld character, and look who leased Building 7.
[00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:26.385]  I mean, we're not just saying this.
[00:43:26.425 --> 00:43:28.387]  It's been in the major papers that
[00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:32.152]  No private building in the country had this many government tenants.
[00:43:32.272 --> 00:43:36.015]  CIA, Defense Intelligence, Army Intelligence.
[00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:39.137]  It had the FBI in it.
[00:43:39.497 --> 00:43:40.738]  It had the IRS in it.
[00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:42.700]  It had the regular Army in it.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.161]  It had the Navy in it.
[00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:46.102]  It had the county, the city, the state.
[00:43:46.602 --> 00:43:47.643]  It had FEMA in it.
[00:43:49.765 --> 00:43:54.448]  The entire building was a huge, spook command base.
[00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:19.256]  The former German Defense Minister, former Minister of Technology as well, and former head of the Reichstag intelligence, he was the head of oversight in the Parliament, very intelligent, Andres from Yulow, has said clearly from all the evidence he's got, it looks as if they ran the attacks from Building 7, coordinating with an office in the Pentagon.
[00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:25.000]  And people nitpick this, you know, I say, I simplify it, the CIA ran drills.
[00:44:26.381 --> 00:44:29.544]  And then I get nitpicked by the Disinfo artist out there going,
[00:44:30.322 --> 00:44:36.147]  Oh, but look, it was a Pentagon Protective Office drill run with the Pentagon and NORAD.
[00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:37.888]  He wasn't CIA.
[00:44:37.928 --> 00:44:39.650]  This man's a disinfo agent.
[00:44:42.071 --> 00:44:51.679]  The CIA broke the news three years ago in a press release bragging how they ran and wrote the drill.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:57.564]  And then, of course, they did it in conjunction with the Pentagon and others.
[00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:00.771]  Of course!
[00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:04.332]  See, that's how strong... and I'm digressing already here.
[00:45:05.152 --> 00:45:09.133]  But that's... I really ought to do a whole show on straw men attacks.
[00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:13.154]  Because that's what they do to our movement.
[00:45:13.194 --> 00:45:19.455]  They either go and attack some disinfo agent who openly puts out ridiculous information, like no planes hit Tower 1 or 2.
[00:45:20.995 --> 00:45:29.157]  They either go attack stuff like that, and that's clear plants, or they claim we said things we didn't say, or they play little semantical games.
[00:45:33.638 --> 00:45:38.363]  Now, let me go back to what the caller said because it's so important.
[00:45:40.085 --> 00:45:42.308]  Let me go back to what Tonto was just discussing.
[00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:47.113]  We need to focus on Silverstein.
[00:45:48.054 --> 00:45:55.042]  Yes, that's one of the weakest parts of their story where we've caught them absolutely red-handed, hand in the cookie jar.
[00:45:56.562 --> 00:46:02.365]  But for people who think they just carried out 9-11 to get seven plus billion dollars, no.
[00:46:02.625 --> 00:46:04.767]  This is what these master criminal networks do.
[00:46:05.247 --> 00:46:12.511]  For every piece of the plan, they make sure that those that take part in it, profit from it.
[00:46:15.112 --> 00:46:15.492]  Okay?
[00:46:16.713 --> 00:46:25.758]  And so that's, you make a hundred and ninety million something dollar, it was like a hundred ninety eight million dollar upfront investment two months before,
[00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:27.877]  Silverstein gets full control.
[00:46:28.117 --> 00:46:30.338]  He takes out double insurance on both towers.
[00:46:30.698 --> 00:46:32.638]  He's collected $7.3 billion now.
[00:46:32.658 --> 00:46:40.620]  If you watch a martial law, I say $6 point something billion, and then a straw person would nitpick that.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.381]  They'd say, oh look, it's really $7.3, but he says $6.9.
[00:46:45.161 --> 00:46:46.521]  Well, he got more since then.
[00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:47.421]  He got a little extra.
[00:46:53.262 --> 00:46:56.163]  So, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with here.
[00:46:59.594 --> 00:47:01.535]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Philly.
[00:47:01.595 --> 00:47:02.175]  Fred, welcome.
[00:47:03.396 --> 00:47:04.216]  Greetings, Alex.
[00:47:04.877 --> 00:47:05.677]  Greetings, Earthling.
[00:47:05.697 --> 00:47:06.037]  What's up?
[00:47:07.378 --> 00:47:12.401]  Okay, there's something very interesting that was on television.
[00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:25.988]  I believe it was Harry Reid, around the ninth, he said that there's a critical need for arming our own forces on our own territory, on U.S.
[00:47:26.028 --> 00:47:28.269]  territory, that there is not a single
[00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:33.031]  Combat Ready Brigade on U.S.
[00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:43.135]  soil, and that he was in favor of immediate $75 billion in new spending to do that.
[00:47:46.377 --> 00:47:48.338]  Well, number one, that's a total lie.
[00:47:48.358 --> 00:47:50.360]  It's the same thing the local city councils do.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.001]  These guys all come from the same place.
[00:47:52.401 --> 00:47:55.003]  It's the same tricks at a higher level on a bigger scale.
[00:47:55.623 --> 00:48:09.132]  They won't fill the potholes or put new radios in the police cars and ambulances until they've had four or five bond proposals and got them passed and then instantly invested that in private companies and then they still don't put the money into it.
[00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:15.016]  And so they always hold back on the bare essentials to telegraph the illusion that there's no money.
[00:48:16.877 --> 00:48:18.578]  They have C.I.A.
[00:48:18.618 --> 00:48:26.343]  now going into control of every major FEMA emergency management center in every major city, even mid-sized cities and small towns.
[00:48:27.424 --> 00:48:31.266]  They have troops everywhere, training with Mexican, Canadian and other troops.
[00:48:32.227 --> 00:48:34.288]  They have homeland security all over the place.
[00:48:35.035 --> 00:48:38.097]  So, that's really a lie, but I missed this.
[00:48:38.477 --> 00:48:39.978]  $75 billion for domestic ops?
[00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:46.341]  That is bigger than a... Well, that's almost bigger than the occupation cost each year of Iraq.
[00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:56.106]  Well, he said it was for just military... general military spending to bring a... I think he used the word brigade.
[00:48:56.146 --> 00:48:59.727]  Now, what is below division in military groups?
[00:49:00.508 --> 00:49:03.349]  What is the unit below division, Alex?
[00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:04.570]  You would know that.
[00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:06.871]  No, my brain's not working.
[00:49:06.891 --> 00:49:18.594]  Okay, well, it's not platoon, it's not division, it's not army, but there is, he said there was not a single combat-ready brigade, I think it was, brigade in U.S.
[00:49:18.634 --> 00:49:32.219]  territory because of the sending out of our forces out of the country and the mismanagement, the bad logistics that they need to have, you know, all the tanks and all the things that
[00:49:33.465 --> 00:49:40.511]  uh... that the army has for proper brigade but i mean i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
[00:50:02.941 --> 00:50:03.622]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:50:03.642 --> 00:50:10.848]  Have you ever wondered why Lockheed Martin that sells stealth fighters and satellites runs all these TV ads for the last 20 years?
[00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.750]  That's a payoff to the news media, boys and girls.
[00:50:14.631 --> 00:50:16.332]  Or it's a payoff to their own divisions.
[00:50:17.053 --> 00:50:24.399]  A lot of the defense contractors own major stock in the media and then they just basically fund themselves.
[00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:27.962]  It's a revolving door of control.
[00:50:29.303 --> 00:50:31.965]  But, oh no, they've got troops, they've got
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.141]  You know, a point that we should think about is this.
[00:50:36.542 --> 00:50:37.902]  This is very important.
[00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:39.463]  Well, I'm going to talk about it when we get back.
[00:50:40.823 --> 00:50:44.065]  How do the 30 million illegal aliens play into this new world order?
[00:50:44.825 --> 00:50:50.288]  I mean, you know they're there to drive down wages and they're there to balkanize the nation, but what else are they there for?
[00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:53.349]  When we get back, we'll break it down and continue with your calls.
[00:50:53.409 --> 00:50:54.450]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:55.910]  Tons of news straight ahead.
[00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:57.431]  There's talk of Dick Cheney stepping down.
[00:50:57.651 --> 00:50:59.052]  We'll cover that as well in the next hour.
[00:50:59.132 --> 00:50:59.612]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.574 --> 00:51:05.034]  It's here!
[00:51:05.234 --> 00:51:10.036]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.376 --> 00:51:18.058]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.718 --> 00:51:25.781]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:33.043]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.553 --> 00:51:37.594]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:41.435]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:43.776]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.136 --> 00:51:48.037]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.754 --> 00:52:05.318]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.358 --> 00:52:05.858]  are located?
[00:52:06.078 --> 00:52:09.461]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:53:39.002 --> 00:53:39.362]  I think so.
[00:54:06.192 --> 00:54:15.179]  Ten years ago, the general public didn't know there was a world government, a global elite, a NAFTA highway, an American Union, North American Union.
[00:54:15.199 --> 00:54:19.242]  They didn't know about cancer viruses and mercury and the vaccines.
[00:54:20.943 --> 00:54:23.205]  They didn't know what the Council on Foreign Relations was.
[00:54:23.225 --> 00:54:24.967]  Now, the average person does.
[00:54:26.928 --> 00:54:30.931]  Now, the major issue, even mainstream pundits admit, is global government.
[00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:32.512]  The people are mad.
[00:54:32.632 --> 00:54:33.193]  They're awake.
[00:54:34.056 --> 00:54:38.279]  And the smoke and mirrors, the diversions, the distractions won't work anymore.
[00:54:38.299 --> 00:54:50.748]  Hey, I was saying, I always do this, before the break, somebody brought up a point and I was saying I would finish it and then people come in here and talk to me during the break and I don't write a note and I forget what it was.
[00:54:51.629 --> 00:54:53.070]  I guess one of these callers can tell me.
[00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.492]  I was like, I'll tell you after the break!
[00:54:56.392 --> 00:54:57.813]  Then I come back after the break.
[00:54:58.534 --> 00:55:02.417]  I listen to my show sometimes, rebroadcast, and I do that almost every day.
[00:55:04.292 --> 00:55:05.493]  There's just too much on my mind.
[00:55:05.533 --> 00:55:07.234]  I'm like the absent-minded professor here.
[00:55:08.375 --> 00:55:10.456]  What was it I was saying I would talk about?
[00:55:10.476 --> 00:55:17.361]  The caller had... No, that was another caller about Silverstein.
[00:55:17.381 --> 00:55:18.601]  I don't know.
[00:55:18.621 --> 00:55:25.206]  We'll talk to Mike and Omar and Justin and Charles and others here in a minute and they'll be able to tell us.
[00:55:26.467 --> 00:55:28.048]  Paul Watson is joining us, but I'm going to just
[00:55:29.495 --> 00:55:31.577]  You smattered the entire interview with your great calls.
[00:55:31.617 --> 00:55:32.818]  I love the directions you take us in.
[00:55:32.838 --> 00:55:33.819]  We'll get into Dick Cheney.
[00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:38.463]  Next on the chopping block is a question that's from a great source in D.C., Wayne Madsen.
[00:55:39.844 --> 00:55:45.469]  Before I do that, we have America, Freedom to Fascism, here in stock, on the shelves, 1995.
[00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:54.237]  An incredible film about the root problem, who owns this country, the private fellow reserve, their income tax system, the 16th Amendment not being ratified,
[00:55:54.947 --> 00:55:56.488]  The Control Grid going into play.
[00:55:56.668 --> 00:55:57.649]  Such an important film.
[00:55:57.689 --> 00:55:59.010]  It's even better than what you saw in theaters.
[00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.231]  It's been beefed up.
[00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:01.192]  So professional.
[00:56:01.212 --> 00:56:03.413]  You need to have it.
[00:56:03.433 --> 00:56:03.413]  $19.95.
[00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:05.335]  Get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:06.576]  You cannot beat that deal.
[00:56:06.616 --> 00:56:15.162]  Even if you already have Terror Storm, get America Freedom from Fascism and for $9.95, get Terror Storm when you order it with it, if you'd like, and give that as a gift.
[00:56:15.692 --> 00:56:16.933]  You cannot beat that price, $9.95.
[00:56:17.473 --> 00:56:19.975]  It's rock bottom.
[00:56:20.035 --> 00:56:21.415]  I just want to get the film out to you.
[00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:24.697]  Available when you get American Freedom from Fascism for $9.95 at infowars.com.
[00:56:28.712 --> 00:56:41.919]  There's also all my other documentaries, 15 that I've made, the other books and videos that we carry, like the great film, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions Part 1, that David Ray Griffin says is the best 9-11 film out there.
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:47.222]  Also, David Ray Griffin's new film, 9-11, The Myth and Reality, we have that for you.
[00:56:47.242 --> 00:56:51.624]  We have big discounts when you get multiple films, all available at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:52.185 --> 00:56:56.407]  But if you go to PrisonPlanet.tv, that's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:05.104]  You can get for 15 cents a day a monthly membership or 5 months free if you get a yearly membership.
[00:57:05.144 --> 00:57:06.224]  Now let me be clear about this.
[00:57:08.026 --> 00:57:10.267]  If you go to the site, I guess there's kind of an error there.
[00:57:10.307 --> 00:57:12.328]  It says get a yearly membership and get 3 months free.
[00:57:12.568 --> 00:57:15.010]  You normally get 3 months free when you get a yearly membership.
[00:57:17.091 --> 00:57:17.452]  Okay?
[00:57:18.552 --> 00:57:24.156]  You get 5.3 months free for this month and next month.
[00:57:24.896 --> 00:57:26.958]  Well, the deal stops December 25th.
[00:57:28.072 --> 00:57:35.278]  So you get 5.3 months free when you get a yearly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:36.699 --> 00:57:46.848]  And again, we don't have to go up on prices for this, we're not planning to, but I don't care if you share your passcode with one or two people.
[00:57:47.791 --> 00:57:53.572]  But we just price it to pay for the webmaster and the folks uploading the video and the cameras and the bandwidth charges.
[00:57:53.632 --> 00:57:54.533]  It's 15 cents a day.
[00:57:54.873 --> 00:57:58.394]  It's even lower when you get the yearly membership and get 5.3 months free.
[00:57:58.974 --> 00:58:01.294]  I think it comes out to like 11 cents or something.
[00:58:01.334 --> 00:58:05.475]  I mean you just can't beat this deal and it funds so much of what we're doing.
[00:58:05.836 --> 00:58:10.677]  So please renew your memberships right now if you already had a yearly membership and get 5.3 months free.
[00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:37.560]  Or get a trial monthly membership for $5.95 at PrisonPlanet.tv Or you can call toll free to get America Freedom From Fascism and Terrorist War and the other films 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 We're going to come back and go to Mike, Omar, Justin, Charles and many others and then Paul Watson will be joining us about 8 after in the next hour.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:38.701]  We'll talk about Dick Cheney.
[00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:39.561]  We'll leave you stepping down.
[00:58:41.613 --> 00:58:44.594]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:44.614 --> 00:58:44.874]  Big Brother.
[00:58:44.894 --> 00:58:45.814]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:45.834 --> 00:58:46.374]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:46.394 --> 00:58:46.814]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.991 --> 00:59:04.871]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.892 --> 00:59:09.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.734 --> 00:59:13.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.537 --> 00:59:18.458]  Every major poll shows it.
[00:59:19.859 --> 00:59:22.140]  Letters to the editor, documented.
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:29.543]  Last night, two different national neocon radio shows, both having to admit the people are mad at the New World Order.
[00:59:30.184 --> 00:59:31.264]  It's the central issue.
[00:59:31.344 --> 00:59:33.065]  Both parties are completely distrusted.
[00:59:33.823 --> 00:59:39.628]  Any hopes the Democrats will do the right thing and weren't totally controlled by the same foreign lobbyist has been totally blown away.
[00:59:41.129 --> 00:59:43.191]  There's open talk of Dick Cheney stepping down.
[00:59:43.211 --> 00:59:45.693]  We'll be discussing that in the next segment with Paul Watson.
[00:59:46.853 --> 00:59:48.415]  So the good news is the people are awake.
[00:59:48.435 --> 00:59:56.441]  The bad news is the elite's got control and is hanging on and is militarizing the police to physically block the American people taking control of their lives again.
[00:59:57.382 --> 01:00:01.205]  So we'll be discussing this here and taking your calls through the second and third hours today.
[01:00:01.863 --> 01:00:03.444]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:00:03.484 --> 01:00:04.245]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[01:00:04.265 --> 01:00:04.686]  Go ahead.
[01:00:05.867 --> 01:00:06.427]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:06.827 --> 01:00:10.330]  I think part of the previous caller's word he was looking for was battalion.
[01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:11.912]  I think maybe that was what he was looking for.
[01:00:11.972 --> 01:00:16.216]  Anyway, I think that the press is the key.
[01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:21.660]  You were talking about earlier what ideas we have to get this thing going.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.784]  We need to organize the public protest on days when the mainstream media cannot ignore
[01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:54.063]  uh... protests you know that can make the things on the back burner well i'll tell you this though and and and i agree we should engage in guerrilla info war and that means jumping in front of live feeds and that means holding signs up behind live feeds all of that is very effective where they can't do anything anywhere without us doing this the problem is we had two thousand people at ground zero and that's a conservative estimate on nine eleven and always they'd show downtown manhattan uh... they would show
[01:00:55.077 --> 01:00:56.098]  You know, the wound in the earth.
[01:00:56.618 --> 01:00:58.860]  Notice, and I taped it off the news.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.182]  In fact, if anybody else has got tape of it, send it to him because we're looking for more of it to document it.
[01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:04.964]  If you notice, they wouldn't show anything but the wound.
[01:01:05.225 --> 01:01:06.686]  They wouldn't show the streets around it.
[01:01:06.906 --> 01:01:12.170]  And that's because the streets around it were all wearing black t-shirts saying, you know, 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.250]  Investigate 9-11.
[01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:15.152]  So, sorry, go ahead.
[01:01:15.992 --> 01:01:20.716]  Oh, well, I'm just, every time I talk to you, when I'm on hold, I make a list of things I want to say.
[01:01:21.368 --> 01:01:39.579]  Also, I called you earlier on your TV show and said, if he publicized a timeline of your predictions versus the mainstream media coming around, it would almost be like a zigzag graph of, like, you would say, like, say in January of 2004 about the New World Order, and people would call you, oh, he's crazy.
[01:01:39.619 --> 01:01:44.042]  And then, fast forward about three years later, two years later, oh, OK, we admit it.
[01:01:44.482 --> 01:01:50.366]  It would be this very consistent graph of diagonal lines from when you said it.
[01:01:51.155 --> 01:01:55.456]  I think you said it would add a lot of credence to what we're saying to do that.
[01:02:08.386 --> 01:02:17.437]  That's the paradox here, there's many paradoxes, but what we have said has come true, and still some want to call us kooks, but that's a minority now.
[01:02:18.098 --> 01:02:20.861]  And listen, I'm a busy bee doing other stuff.
[01:02:20.981 --> 01:02:24.165]  I would love for some of you out there, people always ask, can I volunteer, can I help?
[01:02:24.685 --> 01:02:25.566]  You know, write it up.
[01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:27.608]  Make the graph for those that have the skills.
[01:02:27.668 --> 01:02:28.288]  Put it together.
[01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:29.009]  Send it to us.
[01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:37.136]  You know, have a link to the article I wrote or the poll wrote and then have our prediction or what we say and then show it four years later, you know, in the mainstream news.
[01:02:37.196 --> 01:02:38.557]  I mean, I think that's a great idea.
[01:02:39.281 --> 01:02:40.581]  Not just predictions.
[01:02:40.641 --> 01:02:43.442]  I've made predictions and analysis other people made.
[01:02:43.462 --> 01:02:45.902]  But again, it's not that hard.
[01:02:46.182 --> 01:02:53.203]  The CFR, the globalists, actually brag about what they're going to do to us, but it's in scholarly journals and dissertations.
[01:02:53.243 --> 01:02:54.724]  It's never on the nightly news.
[01:02:55.844 --> 01:02:57.264]  I've got one last thing I want to say.
[01:02:57.364 --> 01:03:01.125]  It's easy for everybody to do, but they do on the Dave Long Plus show.
[01:03:01.565 --> 01:03:08.046]  If we refer to Republicans and Democrats as Republicans and Demoblicans, and don't even quit saying Republicans and Demoblicans, that would like
[01:03:08.755 --> 01:03:09.935]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:09.975 --> 01:03:11.056]  That's another good point.
[01:03:11.436 --> 01:03:11.856]  Exactly.
[01:03:11.896 --> 01:03:12.536]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:12.576 --> 01:03:13.196]  Great call.
[01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.537]  And, you know, I try to do that.
[01:03:15.637 --> 01:03:17.198]  I don't call Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda.
[01:03:17.218 --> 01:03:18.438]  I call it Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[01:03:19.178 --> 01:03:21.119]  And I did coin that term.
[01:03:21.199 --> 01:03:23.340]  I'm pretty darn proud of myself.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.900]  Well, let's be honest.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.881]  A couple weeks after 9-11, a caller coined it.
[01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:29.522]  And I openly said on air I was stealing it.
[01:03:29.802 --> 01:03:30.402]  But let's say this.
[01:03:30.562 --> 01:03:33.143]  I popularized it.
[01:03:33.203 --> 01:03:33.743]  I'm proud of that.
[01:03:33.783 --> 01:03:35.864]  I popularized Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:43.198]  And I did invent and coin propaganda placement instead of product placement when government buys media.
[01:03:43.218 --> 01:03:43.759]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.258 --> 01:03:59.482]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:01.725]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:09.735]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:17.492]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.892 --> 01:04:29.299]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.639 --> 01:04:33.102]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.602 --> 01:04:35.483]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.863 --> 01:04:39.706]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.126 --> 01:04:53.866]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.026 --> 01:04:54.766]  Terrorism!

[01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.808]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:03.048 --> 01:05:05.509]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.909 --> 01:05:20.472]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.512 --> 01:05:20.812]  government.
[01:05:21.012 --> 01:05:22.812]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.192 --> 01:05:28.654]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:33.275]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:06:09.108 --> 01:06:11.410]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:06:43.643 --> 01:06:45.684]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.262]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:12.825]  Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade.
[01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:19.248]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[01:07:21.189 --> 01:07:24.872]  The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:28.374]  But I am still alive.
[01:07:33.229 --> 01:07:35.330]  I was a sailor.
[01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:37.991]  I was born upon the tide.
[01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:43.194]  With the sea I did abide.
[01:07:44.834 --> 01:07:48.316]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[01:07:50.877 --> 01:07:54.299]  I went aloft to twirl the mainsail in a float.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.462]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed.
[01:08:02.223 --> 01:08:29.613]  But I'm living still I was a dam builder Across a river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
[01:08:44.546 --> 01:08:45.886]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:45.906 --> 01:08:49.067]  Glad that you have joined us here today.
[01:08:50.007 --> 01:08:51.748]  We are the Modern Day Explorers.
[01:08:51.888 --> 01:08:54.288]  We are getting outside of the controlled paradigm.
[01:08:54.308 --> 01:08:55.549]  We're getting outside the box.
[01:08:55.649 --> 01:08:55.989]  We are
[01:08:57.143 --> 01:09:00.325]  Rediscovering our liberty, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights.
[01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:11.871]  We're resisting the parasitic overlords of the planet that are setting up their one-world government to exterminate 90% of us in an orderly fashion and to take control of human development according to their designs.
[01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.432]  We are going to resist them.
[01:09:13.472 --> 01:09:14.493]  We are going to defeat them.
[01:09:14.513 --> 01:09:15.793]  We are going to bring them to justice.
[01:09:15.813 --> 01:09:23.278]  We're going to continue with Omar and Justin and Charles and Ron and others early in this hour, riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:09:23.298 --> 01:09:23.918]  Ian Watson?
[01:09:25.262 --> 01:09:29.064]  He's been popping in the last few months with short reports, but he'll be with us for the next 50 minutes here.
[01:09:30.325 --> 01:09:32.206]  And Paul, thank you for coming on.
[01:09:32.886 --> 01:09:33.887]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:40.070]  Paul Watson is the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:45.613]  I want to get into Cheney first, and next on the chopping block, this is from Wayne Madsen.
[01:09:46.253 --> 01:09:51.996]  But before we get to that, give us kind of a preview of some of the other news stories and issues you're going to be discussing.
[01:09:53.066 --> 01:10:18.771]  Well, obviously I want to talk about the post-election, or post-changing-of-the-guard issue, and I think one of the most under-reported, spun-and-censored stories of 2006 is the deliberate and open declaration of psychological warfare on the American people via the agenda to infiltrate, regulate and pollute the Internet.
[01:10:20.726 --> 01:10:24.327]  That's right, they just publicly announced what they've already been criminally doing.
[01:10:26.068 --> 01:10:43.674]  Right, and I'm amazed that it received so little attention because in early September Bush gave a speech in which he announced the declassification of the White House's own planning strategy on how to win the war on terror.
[01:10:44.423 --> 01:10:50.906]  Which he said, you know, they'd been pursuing since 9-11 but was only just declassified two months ago.
[01:10:52.026 --> 01:11:05.893]  And most of your listeners will remember Bush in front of the United Nations just a few days or a week after 9-11 in which he said we must never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories about 9-11.
[01:11:06.913 --> 01:11:13.296]  Well this, in September, was codified in the White House's own strategy paper
[01:11:14.013 --> 01:11:19.238]  Which you can read on the White House website, which we link to when we put the articles out about this.
[01:11:19.598 --> 01:11:30.247]  And so there's no stretch to say that Popular Mechanics and others with members of Homeland Security's family running it are just, and Hearst Publishing wrote the book on yellow journalism, I mean this is pure op.
[01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:35.892]  Well exactly, because it directly targets, quote, conspiracy theories
[01:11:36.653 --> 01:11:41.615]  As a wellspring for the ideas of terrorists and a recruiting ground for terrorists.
[01:11:41.675 --> 01:11:53.400]  By the way, I was on Fox News last night on their website and there was a little featured video blog saying that not just 9-11 truthers, but any liberal bloggers that were really working for Al-Qaeda know.
[01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:56.002]  Right, that's the new paradigm.
[01:11:56.522 --> 01:12:03.665]  Not completely ignoring the National Intelligence Assessment which says that obviously it's the policies of the US government which
[01:12:04.978 --> 01:12:18.289]  Create terrorists is their own policies and actions that do this, but know where the targets, the conspiracy theories, are the motivation for the terrorists according to the White House's own strategy on winning the war on terror.
[01:12:18.329 --> 01:12:23.793]  So you read that and you become very aware of the fact that there's this chilling effect which targets bloggers
[01:12:24.318 --> 01:12:26.020]  From whatever political persuasion.
[01:12:26.621 --> 01:12:30.766]  And quote, conspiracy theorists, which obviously we'd be lumped into that category.
[01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:35.171]  But Pandora's box has already opened, the genie's out of the bottle, the cat's out of the bag.
[01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:38.756]  I mean, it's, you know, the dice have already been thrown.
[01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:55.937]  I mean I heard major pundits on show after show last night, well two big national shows, all agreeing that the people hate the new world order, that's the new main political issue in America, that they hate globalism, they hate the North American Union, that both parties now have lost all credibility
[01:12:56.577 --> 01:13:07.561]  And just Bush and the neocons in the military coming out and admitting they're planning lies and mailing fake letters to the editor, and Diebold has their employees out on the internet attacking people, posing.
[01:13:07.901 --> 01:13:09.981]  I mean, they've just shown themselves!
[01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:11.082]  Everything we said!
[01:13:11.902 --> 01:13:13.342]  But again, why are they doing this?
[01:13:13.402 --> 01:13:16.363]  Because we are cleaning their clocks!
[01:13:17.824 --> 01:13:21.885]  Right, because there's so many of us that have started our own websites that
[01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:28.591]  It's very hard for them to overturn the sheer amount of people that are voicing their discontent.
[01:13:28.611 --> 01:13:33.154]  Well, we also investigate whoever attacks us, and nine times out of ten, they're a big fat fad.
[01:13:34.415 --> 01:13:40.400]  Well, yeah, and it's... I mean, The Guardian had an article in 2002 called The Fake Persuaders.
[01:13:41.218 --> 01:13:50.444]  In which it was revealed that Monsanto hired fake bloggers to trash a scientific report about GM food contamination.
[01:13:50.464 --> 01:13:51.945]  You know, Paul, that just gave me an idea.
[01:13:51.985 --> 01:13:56.327]  You or your brother, great writers you are, shouldn't do just a story on the Pentagon's fake news.
[01:13:56.347 --> 01:13:58.509]  We ought to do one on propaganda placement.
[01:13:58.529 --> 01:14:02.551]  Remember you wrote one on my comments like four years ago, one of the first articles you wrote for me?
[01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:10.055]  We ought to do one about propaganda placement, the art of fake news in 2006, and just break down all the admissions of this.
[01:14:10.476 --> 01:14:10.756]  Go ahead.
[01:14:11.684 --> 01:14:11.984]  Right.
[01:14:12.604 --> 01:14:29.012]  You coined the term propaganda placement and it's the same thing that they would call viral marketing, which is where they go in and create phony advocacy and campaign groups and activist groups purely out of false perception of creating
[01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:33.099]  Artificially, supposedly what the majority think.
[01:14:33.279 --> 01:14:35.881]  Oh, but the country's not going in the wrong direction, Paul.
[01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:36.701]  Everything's fine.
[01:14:36.961 --> 01:14:42.303]  Having the Pentagon running around secretly and now publicly, planting news and lying to us is freedom.
[01:14:43.504 --> 01:14:44.384]  Well, exactly.
[01:14:44.404 --> 01:14:57.570]  And they would say they were, quote, setting the record straight on the war on terror, which is what this latest CENTCOM-Pentagon initiative seeks to do, whereby they counter the propaganda of
[01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:12.879]  The terrorists, which is what the White House has said, that the propaganda speaking out against the war on terror... Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, all of them, and Laura Ingraham are saying we're Al-Qaeda now, when really their bosses are Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[01:15:14.639 --> 01:15:15.900]  I say more power to them.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.341]  In fact, let them even arrest me.
[01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:21.083]  Show everybody just how evil you are.
[01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.904]  Show them how you want to kill this country, you bastards.
[01:15:24.324 --> 01:15:24.725]  Excuse me.
[01:15:26.265 --> 01:15:26.986]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:27.026 --> 01:15:27.266]  I mean,
[01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:29.530]  You've also made the analogy.
[01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:37.195]  They've loaded the gun, they've taken off the safety, they've held it right up against our heads, but not yet pulled the trigger.
[01:15:37.235 --> 01:15:40.577]  They've got the infrastructure of tyranny, of dictatorship in place.
[01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.800]  And then along come the Democrats to save us all.
[01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:47.382]  Will they tear down the infrastructure
[01:15:47.913 --> 01:15:55.518]  Of tyranny, or will they just ignore it and carry on with the same policy with a, you know, a kindler, gentler form of fascism?
[01:15:55.678 --> 01:15:57.959]  Well, we now know that it's just that.
[01:15:57.979 --> 01:16:02.262]  They're calling for increased funding, domestic increased operations, everything.
[01:16:02.302 --> 01:16:04.964]  They're just... Do whatever James Baker says.
[01:16:05.084 --> 01:16:06.104]  Oh, he's so wonderful.
[01:16:07.485 --> 01:16:15.370]  Right, and it's... They can play that scam by characterizing the political field over the next two years.
[01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:16.791]  This is what's likely going to happen.
[01:16:17.634 --> 01:16:43.639]  with political tokenism which started last week with the resignation of Rumsfeld and is likely to continue as you mentioned with the top story we've got on prisonplanet.com by Wayne Madsen who predicted in late October that Rumsfeld would step down that Cheney is going to be the next sacrificial lamb offered up in the arena, in the theatre of political tokenism
[01:16:44.554 --> 01:16:54.561]  Which feeds into the steam valve effect that has been perpetrated upon a discontented population with this election.
[01:16:54.741 --> 01:17:01.926]  Well this is huge steam valving we're witnessing and they must be desperate if they're doing that but I want them to know they can't put perfume on a pig.
[01:17:02.626 --> 01:17:05.348]  I mean, I don't think they can put this back in the bottle again, Paul.
[01:17:05.448 --> 01:17:07.130]  I mean, it's critical mass now.
[01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:08.891]  People know they're murdering terrorists.
[01:17:08.911 --> 01:17:11.373]  I mean, I think 9-11 Truth, I think, is the heart of this.
[01:17:11.413 --> 01:17:14.275]  The general public now knows they're murdering terrorists.
[01:17:14.576 --> 01:17:18.779]  And they know that James Baker and others control those that carried out the terror attacks.
[01:17:19.039 --> 01:17:20.741]  They know Baker himself was a puppet.
[01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:26.405]  And I'm just here to tell the government, your cover's blown, your credibility's gone, there's no putting it back together again.
[01:17:26.465 --> 01:17:26.925]  I'm sorry!
[01:17:28.647 --> 01:17:29.848]  Exactly, which is why we
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.161]  We're good to go.
[01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:54.773]  It's still a long way from the sheer size and influence of the progressive community, which was starting to get involved with certain aspects of the 9-11 community.
[01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:56.735]  Which would have been a huge engine we need.
[01:17:56.755 --> 01:18:00.978]  That engine's basically out of gas, so we've just got to crank the others up even higher.
[01:18:01.899 --> 01:18:11.367]  That's right, because you've always had the establishment left gatekeepers, like, you know, your counterpunch and your Capitol Hill Blue and Democracy Now and people like that.
[01:18:12.116 --> 01:18:16.260]  So we got to throw that gas back into the engine and crank it up again.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:35.536]  Because, as many people noticed, as soon as the results came through last week, the establishment crowd had a giddy, celebratory and accusatory tone saying that this has changed it, we've won the battle, now we can get on with the agenda, and it's a scam!
[01:18:37.725 --> 01:18:42.588]  Yeah, you 9-11 conspiracy people need to go back to sleep and there's no election fraud.
[01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:44.449]  Go back to sleep.
[01:18:44.569 --> 01:18:45.309]  Everything's fine.
[01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:45.750]  Uh-uh.
[01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:47.751]  We're not going back to sleep.
[01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:50.352]  We'll be right back with your calls and more.
[01:18:50.372 --> 01:18:50.793]  Stay with us.
[01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:51.333]  More on Cheney.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.201]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:18:53.281 --> 01:18:54.021]  Today is November 13, 2006.

[01:18:57.443 --> 01:18:58.143]  That's $650.35 and $325.38.
[01:18:58.243 --> 01:19:05.847]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interests.
[01:19:20.794 --> 01:19:24.037]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:19:24.097 --> 01:19:27.539]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:19:27.599 --> 01:19:30.601]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[01:19:30.962 --> 01:19:33.684]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[01:19:46.756 --> 01:19:48.918]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:49.058 --> 01:19:51.400]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:15.729]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:21.893]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.

[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:09.565]  Defending the Republic, going up against world government at point-blank range.
[01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.667]  I'm here to tell you we've had
[01:23:20.643 --> 01:23:21.444]  A great victory.
[01:23:22.104 --> 01:23:25.668]  The majority of Americans now know and hate world government.
[01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:28.390]  They now know that the world government even exists.
[01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.093]  They now know the name Bilderberg.
[01:23:31.353 --> 01:23:34.015]  They now know the name CFR.
[01:23:34.596 --> 01:23:36.597]  And the enemy knows we're coming for them.
[01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:39.860]  The first step in a fight is knowing there's a fight.
[01:23:40.441 --> 01:23:42.843]  And it's knowing who your adversary is.
[01:23:43.584 --> 01:23:45.425]  And it's taking action against them.
[01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:47.027]  And we're doing that here.
[01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:52.273]  I want to get into a revolt that is forming against the traitor Nancy Pelosi.
[01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.855]  I want to also get more into Dick Cheney.
[01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:55.796]  Will he be stepping down?
[01:23:55.856 --> 01:23:58.158]  Who Robert Gates really is?
[01:23:59.078 --> 01:24:00.759]  And the whole Iran situation.
[01:24:00.839 --> 01:24:02.381]  What Al-Syeda is up to?
[01:24:02.661 --> 01:24:04.542]  But Paul Watson, right now, let's go to some calls.
[01:24:04.942 --> 01:24:06.964]  Omar in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:24:07.004 --> 01:24:07.384]  Welcome.
[01:24:07.945 --> 01:24:10.366]  Hey, how y'all doing today, American citizens?
[01:24:10.787 --> 01:24:12.388]  Death to the New World Order.
[01:24:13.032 --> 01:24:23.338]  The New World Order must be destroyed, along with the United Nations Council for Relations, the 300 Committee, all corporations and news groups that help them.
[01:24:24.898 --> 01:24:25.979]  What do you think about that?
[01:24:26.239 --> 01:24:27.360]  Amen to that, my friend!
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.401]  Hey, because, you know, it's war!
[01:24:29.421 --> 01:24:30.702]  They're waging war on us!
[01:24:31.122 --> 01:24:31.522]  They are!
[01:24:31.562 --> 01:24:36.925]  You know, and they done killed, murdered 3,000 people in September 11th.
[01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:42.408]  And all the proof is there against them, and these Democrats talk about no, uh,
[01:24:43.089 --> 01:24:45.572]  No impeachment, even Conyers.
[01:24:45.612 --> 01:24:48.295]  You know, I mean, that's just ridiculous.
[01:24:49.796 --> 01:24:56.504]  And if we stand for that, we like a rape victim that they've been raped seven or eight times and did nine or ten and we go back.
[01:24:58.152 --> 01:25:02.274]  Well, absolutely, and people really thought Conyers and others would do something.
[01:25:02.334 --> 01:25:04.475]  They thought Waxman would do something.
[01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:08.297]  They're going to do nothing, and if they do have some little hearing, it'll be some petty issue.
[01:25:08.317 --> 01:25:09.217]  It'll be a straw man.
[01:25:09.638 --> 01:25:18.162]  Straw men go, well, there's multiple types of straw men, but a lot of it isn't just claiming somebody said something they didn't to discredit them.
[01:25:18.582 --> 01:25:19.703]  It's just like Bush said.
[01:25:19.723 --> 01:25:22.024]  You're either with the American people or you're against them.
[01:25:22.124 --> 01:25:24.126]  And we got to hold their feet to the fire on that.
[01:25:44.935 --> 01:25:45.235]  I agree.
[01:25:45.255 --> 01:25:52.820]  Paul Watson comments on... Oh, by the way, Howard Dean is going to try to, quote, help the Labour Party and Tony Blair in the next election.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:55.101]  That's how traitorous Howard Dean is.
[01:25:55.141 --> 01:25:55.722]  Comments, Paul?
[01:25:57.403 --> 01:26:01.746]  Well, yeah, because a lot of the British people are going to fall for the same scam.
[01:26:02.346 --> 01:26:07.229]  Because the Tories, the opposition party to Labour, have come out against National ID Cards.
[01:26:07.964 --> 01:26:12.507]  And again, some of the key issues that the British populist hate blare for.
[01:26:13.107 --> 01:26:25.214]  So they may fall for the same scam and vote in the Tories, which dovetailed with former President H. W. Bush's same agenda back in the early 90s when the Tories were in power.
[01:26:26.134 --> 01:26:27.175]  But look at it this way.
[01:26:27.895 --> 01:26:36.640]  If you were Karl Rove, and if there was really any difference between the Democrats and the Republicans, what would you do for the next two years?
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:57.971]  You'd make Bush come out with this Reagan-esque populist rhetoric about how he's going to close the borders, how he's going to stop the sell-out of key US infrastructure to foreign nations, like the ports and the Chinese takeover, and NAFTA, the North American Union, Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:26:59.996 --> 01:27:10.691]  And then that would reinvigorate the GOP base, which had been so discontented with Bush, and you would probably get an easy election of a Republican candidate like John McCain in 2008.
[01:27:16.178 --> 01:27:21.461]  Let me just add that when he had control of both houses, he couldn't do that because they've got to move the agenda forward.
[01:27:21.841 --> 01:27:27.024]  But now the Democrats have it, they can act like they're trying to do it, but just can't get it passed.
[01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:28.985]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:27:29.025 --> 01:27:37.269]  In fact, Limbaugh's even admitted it now, I can't believe he must have taken truth serum, that quote, in a sick way, George Bush wanted the Democrats to win.
[01:27:37.309 --> 01:27:38.690]  There's no sick way about it.
[01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:42.192]  Now they can get their agenda through of totally open borders, Paul.
[01:27:43.456 --> 01:27:50.202]  Right, because the mass amnesty of illegal aliens was being prevented by Bush's own Republican Congress.
[01:27:50.823 --> 01:27:52.284]  The Democrats are all for it.
[01:27:53.065 --> 01:28:00.051]  You mentioned the investigations that Pelosi, Dean and Conyers have now backed away from completely.
[01:28:00.812 --> 01:28:04.575]  Will public pressure and popular opinion and other
[01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:13.016]  You know, genuine Democrats, people like Murtha, although we were naive to think Conyers was genuine before his statement on Friday.
[01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:15.678]  Will they push for a real investigation?
[01:28:16.699 --> 01:28:22.383]  Probably yes, and it will happen, but it will be a sham because both parties are completely compromised.
[01:28:22.403 --> 01:28:26.046]  There are so many skeletons in the closet, they don't want to open the closet.
[01:28:27.407 --> 01:28:31.310]  Yeah, and again, I'm no Democrat, but in fairness to Conyers and others,
[01:28:32.336 --> 01:28:35.540]  If they don't tell the line, they just better stay out of small airplanes.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.041]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:28:37.322 --> 01:28:39.945]  We're gonna come back, take more calls, get into a bunch of other facets.
[01:28:39.965 --> 01:28:40.405]  Stay with us.
[01:28:42.227 --> 01:28:43.128]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:45.211]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.132 --> 01:28:48.835]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.853 --> 01:28:55.275]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:55.775 --> 01:28:59.098]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:28:59.478 --> 01:29:02.420]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:29:02.701 --> 01:29:09.066]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:29:09.146 --> 01:29:13.549]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:29:13.789 --> 01:29:18.151]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:20.912]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:29:20.932 --> 01:29:23.693]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:29:24.153 --> 01:29:26.694]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:29:26.734 --> 01:29:30.996]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:29:31.056 --> 01:29:31.896]  Treasury bonds.
[01:29:32.176 --> 01:29:36.800]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.622]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:38.642 --> 01:29:40.623]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:29:53.539 --> 01:29:54.580]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:57.701]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:29:57.961 --> 01:30:02.124]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:30:02.544 --> 01:30:03.384]  So what do you do?
[01:30:03.684 --> 01:30:08.247]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:30:08.755 --> 01:30:10.856]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:30:11.356 --> 01:30:26.060]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:32:04.355 --> 01:32:05.216]  Welcome back folks.
[01:32:05.256 --> 01:32:07.438]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 to 2.
[01:32:07.918 --> 01:32:09.800]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:13.083]  Going out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:32:15.045 --> 01:32:18.208]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave WWCR.
[01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:20.070]  And you can always
[01:32:22.128 --> 01:32:28.352]  Tune in via the internet at Infowars.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com.
[01:32:28.713 --> 01:32:37.739]  We've got the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com, and a guy who writes multiple articles daily and updates the site and does so much more, and your customer service.
[01:32:38.499 --> 01:32:45.224]  Yes, Paul works quite a few hours, and we are so honored to have him here with us.
[01:32:45.244 --> 01:32:47.906]  I want to blitz through some warrior calls.
[01:32:48.721 --> 01:32:54.108]  Justin and Ron and Greg and Jeff, and I'm told Jeff disagrees, so he'll go to the head of the line here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:54.869 --> 01:33:00.156]  But before we go any further, Paul, we have the Holiday Christmas Special running until December 25th.
[01:33:00.536 --> 01:33:03.060]  You normally get three months free when you sign up for a year.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.404]  It's $5.95 a month if you get just, you know, month to month.
[01:33:07.668 --> 01:33:10.429]  You can buy a month trial subscription to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:16.092]  But right now, you sign up, we do this every Christmas, you get 5.3 months free.
[01:33:16.112 --> 01:33:18.353]  It comes out to 5 plus months free.
[01:33:18.373 --> 01:33:20.274]  Did you get my IM about changing that too?
[01:33:21.615 --> 01:33:21.895]  Yeah.
[01:33:22.315 --> 01:33:23.916]  Okay, because it still said 3 months.
[01:33:23.956 --> 01:33:25.097]  That's the deal you always get.
[01:33:25.457 --> 01:33:28.539]  It's 5 plus months free.
[01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:30.500]  Tell folks what they get with PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:32.378 --> 01:33:38.243]  Well, they get the best of the Alex Jones Show, the best audio interviews, including this one.
[01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:49.993]  Special field reports, like the Bilderberg coverage protest that Alex has led in the past, including the 9-11 anniversary protest.
[01:33:50.653 --> 01:33:55.598]  Extra material on that, which, there's a lot on the web, but you get a lot of extra material.
[01:33:55.618 --> 01:33:59.381]  Eighteen hours from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium in L.A.
[01:34:00.097 --> 01:34:08.743]  Yeah, and multiple speeches from the 9-11 anniversary where, you know, Crown Zero workers etc.
[01:34:08.763 --> 01:34:09.824]  come out and give speeches.
[01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:29.357]  Documentaries by other producers, we've got dozens of them by people like Pastor Ted Pike, JFK 2, a documentary on the JFK assassination, Alex Jones TV report, Alex's weekly TV report that shows on Austin, cable access,
[01:34:30.424 --> 01:34:43.575]  My book, Caught Out of Chaos, Alex's book, Descent Into Tyranny, future books that we'll be releasing, and in-studio guest appearances from people on the Alex Jones Show, and a lot more besides.
[01:34:43.715 --> 01:34:53.763]  So, for £39.95 for an entire year, which is over five months free, basically it's fuel for our fire.
[01:34:53.803 --> 01:34:58.207]  It allows us to continue to expand the websites and the operation.
[01:34:59.375 --> 01:35:02.918]  Exactly, and we're in this fight, so it's a great gift to give as well.
[01:35:03.018 --> 01:35:12.486]  I mean, certainly if you buy yourself a year membership, I don't care if you give it to your spouse or maybe one of your neighbors or to someone as a gift, or you want to support us, buy a couple of year memberships.
[01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:19.332]  We have bulk year and bulk month memberships with huge discounts on top of the discounts available at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:19.872 --> 01:35:22.455]  Also, if you want to get America Freedom from Fascism on DVD,
[01:35:23.195 --> 01:35:29.942]  You can get it for $19.95 and then get TerrorStorm for $9.95 if you choose or buy them each individually.
[01:35:29.982 --> 01:35:34.026]  But get half off on TerrorStorm when you get America Freedom to Fascism.
[01:35:34.046 --> 01:35:41.814]  And even if you already have TerrorStorm but don't have America Freedom to Fascism, get America Freedom to Fascism by itself or get TerrorStorm with it at half price and give that as a gift.
[01:35:42.492 --> 01:35:45.055]  And your purchases make this broadcast possible.
[01:35:45.095 --> 01:35:46.536]  We have a gigantic overhead.
[01:35:46.856 --> 01:35:47.937]  We're actually expanding.
[01:35:48.438 --> 01:35:49.599]  And it's all about the fight.
[01:35:49.659 --> 01:35:50.560]  We are obsessed.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.861]  We love what we're doing.
[01:35:51.881 --> 01:35:53.102]  We love fighting this corruption.
[01:35:53.903 --> 01:35:57.226]  So please call toll-free to get America Freedom from Fascism or Terrorist Storm 888-253-3139.
[01:36:04.285 --> 01:36:18.700]  253-3139 or you can write to me on Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin, TX 78704 or go to Infowars.com to produce all the videos and books that we carry there by ourselves and others.
[01:36:19.441 --> 01:36:26.068]  Paul, I want to talk about the positive news here and I hope you or your brother will do a piece or maybe Slick Eisen or maybe Dykes will do a piece on this.
[01:36:27.498 --> 01:36:28.439]  Or maybe I'll do a piece.
[01:36:28.479 --> 01:36:40.548]  I write up maybe an article or two a week myself about the positive things that are happening because it really let me... I heard the panic in their voices by Republican pundits, Democratic pundits on
[01:36:41.585 --> 01:36:43.466]  Different national shows last night.
[01:36:43.846 --> 01:36:48.408]  It mirrors what I've seen in the major polls, but it was the first time I heard mainstream talking about it.
[01:36:48.748 --> 01:37:06.955]  Then I was watching some TV late last night on the computer, some clips, and they were saying it on MSNBC and CNN, and that's that there's a new populist movement that both parties aren't trusted, that it's anti-war, anti-globalism, anti-New World Order, they even use that term, anti-North American Union,
[01:37:07.795 --> 01:37:11.198]  And that the Democrats will be thrown out now if they don't do something.
[01:37:11.558 --> 01:37:20.924]  So really, Paul, what I've been saying here, and I don't like to declare victory because we haven't won, but at least the people now aren't as naive as they used to be.
[01:37:21.424 --> 01:37:28.369]  Real issues are now on the map, and at the grassroots, and we're a small part of that, but a big piece of it.
[01:37:28.949 --> 01:37:29.129]  I think?
[01:37:59.169 --> 01:38:16.793]  Well, as I've said in the past, the benchmark of our success is the fact that we are engaged in a form of brinksmanship whereby we're curtailing the advancement of the agenda which they thought would be light years ahead of what it is now.
[01:38:17.293 --> 01:38:27.235]  After 9-11 we were led to believe that America would come under bioterrorist attack, there would be more attacks on the scale of 9-11 and higher, you know, on an almost
[01:38:27.907 --> 01:38:29.308]  Monthly or yearly basis.
[01:38:29.348 --> 01:38:30.348]  That was the propaganda.
[01:38:30.388 --> 01:38:31.208]  It hasn't happened.
[01:38:31.929 --> 01:38:37.891]  In 2004, I thought they would change the guard because the discontent was growing so much.
[01:38:37.991 --> 01:38:43.273]  I thought they'd stick Kerry in and put the left-wing progressive crowd to sleep.
[01:38:43.413 --> 01:38:44.754]  And I told you they wouldn't do that.
[01:38:45.294 --> 01:38:46.035]  They wouldn't do that?
[01:38:46.055 --> 01:38:48.876]  They wanted to get more gas mileage out of Bush before they flushed him.
[01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:51.777]  They still had a little gas mileage in Bush.
[01:38:52.509 --> 01:38:58.498]  But now, at least, they've come to the point where they have to change the mask, the facade.
[01:38:58.878 --> 01:39:00.901]  So that is a benchmark of our success.
[01:39:00.962 --> 01:39:04.567]  And now we've just, you know, got to hold their feet to the fire, the Democrats.
[01:39:05.271 --> 01:39:08.593]  And get some real results and kind of leave a legacy.
[01:39:09.013 --> 01:39:13.536]  Because if we don't leave a legacy, then the past five years have been completely in vain.
[01:39:13.796 --> 01:39:16.357]  It also tells the world that we don't support this war.
[01:39:16.857 --> 01:39:24.561]  It may be a fake changing of the guard, rearranging of deck chairs, but at least the world knows, and that's good.
[01:39:25.862 --> 01:39:26.162]  Yeah.
[01:39:26.663 --> 01:39:29.904]  I mean, we've been accused of being defeatist, negative.
[01:39:30.605 --> 01:39:32.906]  We haven't said that the fact they've changed the guard
[01:39:34.191 --> 01:39:34.812]  I think so.
[01:39:50.021 --> 01:40:15.187]  And if you create a system whereby you openly trash the Constitution, abolish Geneva Conventions, surveil and spy on the American people, and launch illegal, unjustified wars which kill hundreds and thousands of people, and don't face the consequences, then that infrastructure is still set up whereby a John McCain or a Hillary Clinton will waltz in
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:15.740]  In 2008.
[01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:18.724]  And the exact same thing will continue.
[01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:24.951]  And notice how the mainstream media, even with Colbert, no discussion now of the Military Commissions Act.
[01:40:25.031 --> 01:40:26.773]  No discussion of the Defense Authorization Act 2007.
[01:40:26.853 --> 01:40:28.255]  No discussion of the Patriot Act.
[01:40:31.178 --> 01:40:34.059]  Well exactly, and a lot of the left wing crowd have bought it.
[01:40:58.979 --> 01:41:08.605]  I mean, every time I visit a less-leaning website now, whereas beforehand, you know, they had a lot of excellent material on those kind of websites.
[01:41:08.685 --> 01:41:16.750]  Yeah, they were showing the concentration camps, and New World Order, and what's happening, and what Bush is doing, and now it's like, oh, I just love Hillary!
[01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:24.595]  The quotes that I've seen, and obviously, yeah, there's a minority that haven't gone along with this, and that's good, but
[01:41:25.313 --> 01:41:30.656]  The majority have, and the quotes are like, now we have the power, now we have the power.
[01:41:31.116 --> 01:41:32.257]  You don't have any power.
[01:41:32.537 --> 01:41:41.642]  They've invested their power into the hands of Pelosi, Dean, and this turncoat John Conyers, who have all publicly stated that impeachment is off the table.
[01:41:42.142 --> 01:41:43.443]  But there's no mention of that.
[01:41:43.883 --> 01:41:47.425]  It's this egotistical power trip that now we have the power.
[01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:50.130]  And they really think that they're in control of anything.
[01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.550]  Which is exactly what Republicans did with Bush.
[01:41:52.610 --> 01:41:57.552]  It's that personal power, you know, living in Michigan or living in Ohio or Texas.
[01:41:57.932 --> 01:42:04.794]  Democrats just going around feeling good and polishing the bumper stickers on their cars and feeling like they had a victory.
[01:42:05.895 --> 01:42:10.716]  Just like a sports fan gets off at a primitive level on their team winning.
[01:42:11.096 --> 01:42:16.458]  It may feel good, folks, but at the end of the day it does nothing for your life, nothing for your society.
[01:42:17.338 --> 01:42:19.079]  Well, yeah, you make the sports analogy.
[01:42:19.999 --> 01:42:21.299]  You can take one in England.
[01:42:21.359 --> 01:42:28.222]  In the late 90s, Manchester United won the league title of soccer every year and everybody hated Manchester United.
[01:42:28.782 --> 01:42:35.164]  And then the next year, Chelsea won the title and so everybody liked Chelsea just because they'd beaten Manchester United.
[01:42:35.524 --> 01:42:39.226]  And now Chelsea have won the title for three years running, everybody hates Chelsea.
[01:42:39.506 --> 01:42:46.288]  So it's a big theatre, sports analogy, team thing where they don't realise that both sides are controlled.
[01:42:46.963 --> 01:42:48.984]  And then you look at Pelosi's own record.
[01:42:49.524 --> 01:42:50.965]  She voted for the Patriot Act.
[01:42:51.405 --> 01:42:56.687]  She voted against legislation which simply condemned torture of Iraqis.
[01:42:56.747 --> 01:42:57.907]  It didn't even have any teeth.
[01:42:57.967 --> 01:42:59.608]  It simply condemned torture.
[01:42:59.648 --> 01:43:00.548]  She voted against it.
[01:43:01.209 --> 01:43:11.813]  And then you look at her public speeches, and she's consistently bolstered and been the cheerleader for the legitimacy and necessity of the so-called War on Terror.
[01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.814]  So, you know, even if they bring some of the troops home,
[01:43:15.695 --> 01:43:29.849]  Where's the motivation to not turn them on the American people with the infrastructure that Bush has already set up, which they are not going to repeal according to their own statements, or simply send them away, you know, to face the latest manufactured threat abroad?
[01:43:31.450 --> 01:43:34.373]  This is the discussion I wanted to have today and I'm glad we're having it.
[01:43:34.594 --> 01:43:36.936]  Justin in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:39.011 --> 01:43:40.052]  Hello?
[01:43:40.372 --> 01:43:41.072]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[01:43:41.372 --> 01:43:45.274]  Just wanted to thank the great affiliates up here in Rochester, WASB 1590.
[01:43:46.095 --> 01:43:50.317]  You probably know the late Dr. Wolf, who set that station up.
[01:43:50.337 --> 01:43:51.858]  Just want to thank them.
[01:43:52.318 --> 01:43:54.019]  Oh yeah, Dr. Wolf died a few years ago.
[01:43:54.039 --> 01:43:54.619]  I was really sad.
[01:43:54.699 --> 01:43:55.439]  He was a great guy.
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.181]  Yeah, I actually go to that church now where he used to pastor.
[01:44:00.082 --> 01:44:02.343]  I just wanted to ask you a question.
[01:44:02.785 --> 01:44:08.427]  I've heard you now a couple times reference this thing where Bill Clinton was recruited by George H.W.
[01:44:08.487 --> 01:44:15.808]  Bush, and I went looking for that information because I actually write articles in my school newspaper at the university I go to.
[01:44:15.828 --> 01:44:26.471]  I write articles every week, carte blanche, whatever I want to write, and I've been throwing missiles at the New World Order, but I'd like to write an article about this because... Sure, sure, let me be clear.
[01:44:27.371 --> 01:44:28.732]  We know that Bush Sr.
[01:44:30.024 --> 01:44:32.986]  I was recruited in the CIA by the mid-1950s.
[01:44:33.607 --> 01:44:38.331]  We know Bush Senior was involved in the Dallas operation in 1963.
[01:44:39.031 --> 01:44:48.138]  We know that in the late 60s when Clinton went to Oxford that he did have some connections in recruiting with the CIA.
[01:44:48.158 --> 01:44:50.240]  You have to go dig that up, but that's come out.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:54.363]  You know, just like Anderson Cooper was at the CIA, you know, the big guy on CNN.
[01:44:55.023 --> 01:44:57.986]  This is where they recruit is out of the Ivy League in England and here.
[01:44:58.666 --> 01:44:59.447]  Then we know
[01:45:00.726 --> 01:45:08.709]  From Terry Reed and a bunch of other CIA operatives that I've interviewed, that there were different Bushes out at MENA, that Clinton worked for them.
[01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:16.732]  We know that Bush Sr., and I have to go dig all this up, had 11 meetings with Clinton in the years before he ran for president.
[01:45:17.012 --> 01:45:18.213]  We know he went to Bilderberg.
[01:45:18.513 --> 01:45:19.733]  And now it's even more clear.
[01:45:20.073 --> 01:45:22.114]  Clinton's called a surrogate son of the Bushes.
[01:45:22.754 --> 01:45:24.015]  He vacations with them.
[01:45:24.893 --> 01:45:25.573]  Yeah, I remember
[01:45:53.524 --> 01:46:14.791]  I think it was at the end of last year we wrote specifically like two or three different articles outlining all those points that you just made so I will repost them tonight just for the caller and that outlines the cozy relationship that they have had and which has obviously been proven by the fact that they have this foundation together whereby
[01:46:15.868 --> 01:46:21.654]  They go around cuddling each other and kissing up to each other on every issue and make it very public.
[01:46:21.895 --> 01:46:23.056]  So I'll repost those.
[01:46:23.557 --> 01:46:31.987]  And that was always the case and understand when I say recruited by CIA we know he had connections to George Bush before he even got in
[01:46:33.010 --> 01:46:34.791]  Well, I have one more comment if you could give me a moment.
[01:46:34.811 --> 01:46:35.912]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:46:35.952 --> 01:46:38.314]  I consider myself a pretty devout Christian
[01:46:59.358 --> 01:47:06.764]  I often have people listen to your show with me and watch your videos to wake them up, because I know that you're a Christian man.
[01:47:06.864 --> 01:47:26.278]  So I just wanted to encourage you to spend some time in God's Word to get your strength, because I know, and I'm not criticizing you, I'm just as an encouragement, brother, and anyone out there who considers themselves a Christian, don't get too wrapped up in looking at the evil in the face while neglecting God's Word.
[01:47:27.592 --> 01:47:29.173]  I totally agree with you.
[01:47:29.253 --> 01:47:33.133]  I love when I get a chance to read the Bible or hear a good sermon.
[01:47:35.254 --> 01:47:39.075]  Listen, I know whose side I'm on, and I appreciate your call.
[01:47:39.775 --> 01:47:40.635]  That's a great call.
[01:47:40.675 --> 01:47:43.876]  Let's go ahead and go to Ron.
[01:47:44.596 --> 01:47:46.337]  Ron, where are you calling us from?
[01:47:46.357 --> 01:47:51.598]  I know Ron's there.
[01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:52.178]  Ron, are you there?
[01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:55.481]  Yeah, I just had a blank on this.
[01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:56.762]  Good afternoon, guys.
[01:47:57.002 --> 01:47:57.482]  Hello, sir.
[01:47:57.522 --> 01:47:57.902]  Go ahead.
[01:47:58.623 --> 01:48:01.444]  Yeah, I wanted to respond to your Friday show.
[01:48:01.484 --> 01:48:07.408]  You were talking about the Godfather movie and the Kennedy assassination.
[01:48:08.069 --> 01:48:18.455]  So I've been working on something for a couple of years, and I'm going to try to link both Kennedy assassinations to the New World Order.
[01:48:19.252 --> 01:48:26.659]  And the other movie that you might want to look at is the Bugsy Siegel story, that movie.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:34.907]  And if you just put the Godfather 2 movie together with the Bugsy Siegel movie... Yeah, Hyman Roth.
[01:48:35.528 --> 01:48:36.389]  Yeah, you'll have your...
[01:48:37.403 --> 01:48:41.967]  You know, you'll have your Kennedy assassination, and also you'll start the border.
[01:48:42.007 --> 01:48:44.809]  You can see who the New World Order is.
[01:48:45.089 --> 01:48:48.572]  Well, of course the Kennedy assassination is connected to the New World Order.
[01:48:48.612 --> 01:48:49.532]  They killed both of them.
[01:48:50.293 --> 01:48:51.454]  Yeah, but that's in the movie.
[01:48:51.774 --> 01:48:55.157]  In other words, they've come forward themselves, okay?
[01:48:55.497 --> 01:48:59.120]  So even though I'm trying to put this together, they've already done it.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.561]  They've already come forward.
[01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:01.061]  Really?
[01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.342]  In the Bugsy Siegel story?
[01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:03.403]  Yes, right.
[01:49:04.105 --> 01:49:19.532]  If you're only going to watch the two movies, alright, if you just want to, let's say, make a connection, it's in the Bugsy Siegel story in the movie that Warren Beatty was the star of that, and it's Godfather 2.
[01:49:20.432 --> 01:49:23.173]  So both of those movies almost repeat each other.
[01:49:24.394 --> 01:49:29.556]  And they give you, they at least give you the idea of why Kennedy was assassinated.
[01:49:29.576 --> 01:49:31.277]  It has to do with laundromats.
[01:49:32.928 --> 01:49:39.054]  They had the one faction of the New World Order had their laundromat in Cuba.
[01:49:39.535 --> 01:49:43.819]  The other faction of the New World Order had their laundromat in Las Vegas.
[01:49:55.137 --> 01:49:58.319]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:00.601]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:08.627]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.307 --> 01:50:16.372]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.752 --> 01:50:23.657]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:50:24.133 --> 01:50:28.175]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.475 --> 01:50:32.017]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.457 --> 01:50:34.358]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.699 --> 01:50:38.621]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:51.852 --> 01:50:54.873]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:55.194 --> 01:51:00.116]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.376 --> 01:51:04.718]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.018 --> 01:51:13.922]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:14.142 --> 01:51:17.744]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:18.044 --> 01:51:23.072]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.372 --> 01:51:30.122]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:30.603 --> 01:51:31.143]  What about you?

[01:52:55.449 --> 01:52:58.311]  I'm going to keep Paul Watson five minutes to the next hour with us.
[01:52:58.351 --> 01:53:03.313]  We have another guest coming up who runs a huge website after Downing Street.
[01:53:05.262 --> 01:53:07.363]  To hear from the Democrats, to hear from the Liberals.
[01:53:07.383 --> 01:53:14.406]  What are they going to do about the traitorous activities that are taking place in front of everyone right now?
[01:53:16.867 --> 01:53:19.008]  But I forgot we had a caller who disagreed.
[01:53:19.068 --> 01:53:19.888]  I apologize.
[01:53:19.928 --> 01:53:21.189]  You normally go to the head of the line.
[01:53:21.769 --> 01:53:25.230]  But let's go ahead and skip a couple callers from Greg and others that we will get to.
[01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:29.032]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Pennsylvania, who I'm told disagrees with something.
[01:53:29.052 --> 01:53:29.672]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:53:30.552 --> 01:53:31.213]  Hello, Alex?
[01:53:31.593 --> 01:53:31.793]  Yes.
[01:53:32.694 --> 01:53:37.979]  I understand you believe there's a conspiracy theory with Child Protective Services?
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:39.901]  Uh, yeah.
[01:53:40.902 --> 01:53:45.045]  Well, I actually work for Child Protective Services in Pennsylvania.
[01:53:46.327 --> 01:53:48.369]  There's no conspiracy theory.
[01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:55.275]  It's a fact that federal numbers, five times more likely for children to be abused
[01:53:55.939 --> 01:54:00.964]  In your system, I'm talking about New York, where they take the children and do medical experiments on them.
[01:54:00.984 --> 01:54:01.984]  That's been all over the news.
[01:54:02.125 --> 01:54:06.008]  I hear in Texas over two-thirds of the children are on psychotropic drugs.
[01:54:06.328 --> 01:54:07.669]  There's over 3,000 missing.
[01:54:07.689 --> 01:54:10.372]  The CPS is grabbed in Florida.
[01:54:10.812 --> 01:54:14.856]  And so when you try to say it's a conspiracy, it's been all over the news.
[01:54:15.997 --> 01:54:17.538]  We don't drug children.
[01:54:17.578 --> 01:54:19.560]  We take advice from the doctors.
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:20.440]  Ah, yes.
[01:54:21.827 --> 01:54:26.874]  And second, you were talking about those drills, I guess, in Michigan.
[01:54:26.894 --> 01:54:28.596]  Yeah, where they put guns to their heads.
[01:54:28.656 --> 01:54:29.037]  Yeah.
[01:54:29.878 --> 01:54:38.269]  Well, those drills, there's nothing really wrong with those drills because it teaches the children not to bring guns to school, not to bring knives to school.
[01:54:38.993 --> 01:54:42.195]  You know, they see worse on TV.
[01:54:42.315 --> 01:54:43.036]  There you go.
[01:54:44.017 --> 01:54:57.546]  You're admitting that terrorism is to make them hate guns and hate the Second Amendment, but the lying feds that pay for this all over the country, where SWAT teams run into eight-year-olds and scream at them while they cry and beg, and it isn't what they see on TV.
[01:54:58.066 --> 01:55:01.609]  While they traumatize them, it's really about letting them not like it.
[01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:07.090]  Uh-huh, but they tell the parents it's when the terrorists attack, so the kids know what to do.
[01:55:07.331 --> 01:55:08.731]  Let me tell you something, sicko.
[01:55:09.251 --> 01:55:12.452]  It's not normal to put guns in little kids' heads while they cry.
[01:55:12.712 --> 01:55:14.773]  And see, you think it's so normal.
[01:55:15.193 --> 01:55:21.214]  You people are designed to destroy society, and unravel society, and a whole bunch of you are perverts.
[01:55:21.535 --> 01:55:23.455]  A big percentage of the time, you're a bunch of perverts.
[01:55:24.755 --> 01:55:27.856]  Look, I've taken a lot of children from incompetent parents.
[01:55:27.896 --> 01:55:29.017]  Yeah, you like it, don't you?
[01:55:29.037 --> 01:55:29.897]  You like the power trip.
[01:55:30.552 --> 01:55:33.274]  There's a lot of bad parents out there.
[01:55:33.614 --> 01:55:33.894]  Hey!
[01:55:33.974 --> 01:55:34.314]  Hey!
[01:55:34.775 --> 01:55:35.795]  Let me tell you something.
[01:55:35.815 --> 01:55:38.317]  You're five times more likely to abuse children.
[01:55:38.517 --> 01:55:40.198]  That's the Justice Department's own numbers.
[01:55:40.418 --> 01:55:42.580]  You have no place to do anything.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:47.323]  A bunch of sickos want your job, who feed off pain and suffering.
[01:55:48.444 --> 01:55:50.285]  You have the highest turnover in the country.
[01:55:50.305 --> 01:55:54.467]  50% of CPS workers quit in one year because they're not sickos.
[01:55:54.728 --> 01:55:56.649]  Only the sickos can keep doing that job.
[01:55:58.437 --> 01:56:01.480]  I haven't seen any sickos here in Pennsylvania, sir.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:02.020]  Yeah, I bet.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:12.368]  Yeah, you think putting guns to little children's heads unannounced, a door busting open, and a SWAT team running in under a federal drill, screaming at little kids is normal?
[01:56:12.769 --> 01:56:13.970]  You people are sick!
[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:15.451]  You're an actual demon!
[01:56:17.754 --> 01:56:18.776]  You make me sick!
[01:56:19.176 --> 01:56:20.118]  You make me sick!
[01:56:20.218 --> 01:56:24.264]  Everybody should get their children out of the public schools so creeps like this can't get a hold of them.
[01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:26.527]  They'll come to your house, they'll trick their way in.
[01:56:26.867 --> 01:56:28.350]  One dirty dish, they take your kid.
[01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:33.858]  Then they go dump them in these big foster homes with dozens of kids and cockroaches and they beat the kids up.
[01:56:34.278 --> 01:56:35.759]  Well, first off, my son actually got sick.
[01:57:04.289 --> 01:57:08.611]  From playing with, uh, this kid down the street here who's homeschooled.
[01:57:08.651 --> 01:57:11.893]  Pure bull, you idiot, ignorant piece of trash!
[01:57:12.534 --> 01:57:17.516]  If your child's been vaccinated, they can't get something from some... Fine.
[01:57:17.896 --> 01:57:18.397]  Stay there.
[01:57:18.957 --> 01:57:20.458]  Paul Watson, I gotta let you go.
[01:57:20.478 --> 01:57:21.799]  I appreciate you coming on.
[01:57:21.819 --> 01:57:22.319]  I gotta talk.
[01:57:22.459 --> 01:57:23.760]  We may even cancel the next guest.
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:26.941]  If you're willing to stay on here, I'll settle down, and I'll let you talk.
[01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:28.182]  People, you wanna see evil?
[01:57:28.522 --> 01:57:29.863]  Evil doesn't even know it's evil.
[01:57:32.273 --> 01:57:37.318]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:37.378 --> 01:57:37.838]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.038 --> 01:57:38.899]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.939 --> 01:57:41.281]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:46.686]  You want answers?
[01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:48.367]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.227 --> 01:58:00.168]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.409 --> 01:58:04.530]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.671 --> 01:58:08.111]  Alright, I'm going to settle down.
[01:58:11.252 --> 01:58:18.495]  Out of the gates, this CPS worker, Jeff in Pennsylvania, says that he thinks the drills
[01:58:19.344 --> 01:58:21.406]  Well, the quality of the education is really in question because
[01:58:48.723 --> 01:58:55.405]  These people who are teaching the homeschoolers aren't, you know, don't have the same experience.
[01:58:55.485 --> 01:58:57.526]  Should you have to have a license to have children?
[01:59:00.807 --> 01:59:02.068]  A license?
[01:59:02.428 --> 01:59:02.728]  No.
[01:59:02.748 --> 01:59:05.028]  Well, you just said, can't we teach our own children?
[01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:07.629]  Do we have to put them in your government school?
[01:59:09.690 --> 01:59:12.391]  Well, there's a lot they wouldn't learn if they didn't go.
[01:59:12.411 --> 01:59:12.811]  That's right.
[01:59:12.831 --> 01:59:17.533]  They need to be socialized in Illinois and California are moving to try to ban homeschooling.
[01:59:17.553 --> 01:59:18.293]  Do you support that?
[01:59:20.268 --> 01:59:23.569]  Well, I believe parents should have to pass a test to teach their kids.
[01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:24.769]  That's right, go to the state.
[01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:27.490]  Hey, did you know this used to be called Land of the Free, Home of the Brave?
[01:59:28.110 --> 01:59:31.231]  Just 20 years ago, you told somebody they couldn't raise their children, they'd laugh at you.
[01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:33.671]  Man, what kind of control freak are you, boy?
[01:59:35.552 --> 01:59:36.752]  I don't know what you mean.
[01:59:37.532 --> 01:59:41.693]  I mean, you think it's good for the SWAT teams to go in and terrorize children.
[01:59:42.293 --> 01:59:44.634]  But you don't think it's terrorizing, do you?
[01:59:45.273 --> 01:59:52.057]  Well, when they go into the school, I'm sure, while it's happening, they probably assure the children and tell, you know... No!
[01:59:52.477 --> 01:59:52.757]  No!
[01:59:53.137 --> 01:59:54.098]  No, I have the A.P.
[01:59:54.178 --> 01:59:54.978]  I have video of it!
[01:59:56.079 --> 01:59:58.040]  My God, what's... Are you so blind?
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:00.321]  You know, you think this is normal?
[02:00:00.381 --> 02:00:01.241]  You think this is good?
[02:00:01.441 --> 02:00:02.762]  Let me ask you, are you like the C.P.S.
[02:00:02.802 --> 02:00:10.426]  worker that tricks their way into the house because the neighbor said they saw something and you see a dirty dick and you trick them into signing a paper without due process and snatch their kids?
[02:00:11.667 --> 02:00:15.068]  Well, there's no tricking that's involved.
[02:00:15.288 --> 02:00:23.670]  I go to the house and then, you know, if there's cause to believe, you know, it's all lawful.
[02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.331]  Oh, you decide!
[02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:26.771]  You're the judge and you're the jury!
[02:00:27.011 --> 02:00:28.971]  You decide and make the determination, huh?
[02:00:29.071 --> 02:00:30.912]  Whatever happened to due process, you monster?
[02:00:32.432 --> 02:00:36.075]  Well, it all depends on how credible the complaint is from a neighbor.
[02:00:36.496 --> 02:00:37.516]  Ah, you decide!
[02:00:37.556 --> 02:00:38.677]  You're the judge and jury!
[02:00:38.857 --> 02:00:39.898]  You're Judge Dredd!
[02:00:40.218 --> 02:00:43.141]  Since when in America did one person decide this stuff?
[02:00:43.321 --> 02:00:46.863]  And on your recommendation, this judge, they created these new courts.
[02:00:47.204 --> 02:00:50.046]  And Bush has created new courts now that he says have all this authority.
[02:00:50.266 --> 02:00:51.567]  Do you say those are legitimate?
[02:00:52.937 --> 02:00:53.858]  Which type of court?
[02:00:53.898 --> 02:00:54.659]  The military?
[02:00:54.839 --> 02:00:55.299]  All of it!
[02:00:55.459 --> 02:00:57.000]  That's what your courts are!
[02:00:57.501 --> 02:01:03.385]  They create these things 35, 40 years ago, just give them new power, the idiot public doesn't know it's on a real court.
[02:01:04.486 --> 02:01:08.249]  Doesn't Congress have the power to establish these courts by the people?
[02:01:08.289 --> 02:01:18.117]  These courts have been set up at the state and county level by these, this is all administrative law judge behavior and the whole thing's about tricking parents, and please don't tell me it isn't.
[02:01:19.853 --> 02:01:21.394]  It's about getting kids in the system.
[02:01:21.434 --> 02:01:26.458]  Don't you know that the more CPS they hire, the worse the numbers for everything in this society?
[02:01:26.538 --> 02:01:27.618]  Everything's unraveling.
[02:01:28.139 --> 02:01:29.279]  So you never knew.
[02:01:29.299 --> 02:01:34.003]  You never knew that you guys are five times more likely to hurt children in your custody.
[02:01:34.203 --> 02:01:37.425]  The most dangerous place for children is in your custody.
[02:01:37.605 --> 02:01:39.406]  That was on the cover of Time Magazine.
[02:01:39.686 --> 02:01:41.728]  Are you saying you don't know about that?
[02:01:42.608 --> 02:01:46.270]  Look, I would have to see what these numbers are based on.
[02:01:46.290 --> 02:01:46.871]  Listen, listen.
[02:01:47.171 --> 02:01:50.793]  You are the worst group of people in the country, statistically.
[02:01:51.013 --> 02:01:52.854]  You ought to have some shame!
[02:01:52.874 --> 02:01:56.016]  Look, I don't hate children at all.
[02:01:56.336 --> 02:01:57.317]  We're trying to help.
[02:01:59.038 --> 02:01:59.639]  Sure you don't.
[02:02:00.419 --> 02:02:04.161]  Hey, did you hear about the 3,000 kids missing in Florida that CPS grabbed?
[02:02:05.542 --> 02:02:06.022]  No, I did not.
[02:02:06.082 --> 02:02:07.804]  Huge national story for years.
[02:02:08.044 --> 02:02:08.884]  You never heard about it?
[02:02:08.904 --> 02:02:09.545]  Well, okay.
[02:02:10.734 --> 02:02:13.098]  Well, if the kids run away, it's not our fault.
[02:02:14.861 --> 02:02:15.002]  Ahhhhhh.
[02:02:17.466 --> 02:02:17.666]  Ahhhhhh.
[02:02:19.089 --> 02:02:20.531]  And they're found with their heads chopped off.
[02:02:21.052 --> 02:02:24.118]  Hey, did you hear about the three top pedophiles running the Florida CPS system?
[02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:25.971]  Miami Herald, you hear about that?
[02:02:26.531 --> 02:02:32.776]  Look, there's a couple of bad apples, but, you know, it's not as widespread as you'd think.
[02:02:33.036 --> 02:02:34.297]  Oh, oh, okay.
[02:02:34.697 --> 02:02:35.117]  All right.
[02:02:35.378 --> 02:02:37.219]  Well, I'll just trust you to not have any due process.
[02:02:37.259 --> 02:02:38.440]  Yeah, I don't need due process.
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:39.360]  We'll just make you king.
[02:02:39.681 --> 02:02:40.261]  How's that sound?
[02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:40.841]  Stay there, Jeff.
[02:02:47.131 --> 02:02:52.597]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.958 --> 02:03:00.606]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.303 --> 02:03:08.348]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.748 --> 02:03:20.155]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.495 --> 02:03:23.998]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.458 --> 02:03:26.379]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.719 --> 02:03:30.482]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.501 --> 02:04:50.923]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:04:51.343 --> 02:04:56.084]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:56.484 --> 02:04:59.105]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:04:59.605 --> 02:05:03.006]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:03.787 --> 02:05:08.108]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:08.548 --> 02:05:11.709]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:12.329 --> 02:05:15.170]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:15.948 --> 02:05:20.212]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:20.232 --> 02:05:20.673]  U.S.
[02:05:20.693 --> 02:05:22.574]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:22.594 --> 02:05:23.215]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:23.535 --> 02:05:23.996]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:24.456]  Ask for George.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:48.602]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:50.383 --> 02:06:04.228]  Two years ago a UT student brought to my attention, and I confirmed as the UT textbook used, the Calhoun Reader, what they call the family of disease, and that we need to be eradicated.
[02:06:04.248 --> 02:06:04.868]  I've had the former
[02:06:05.655 --> 02:06:08.196]  Head of Policy, number two position, Department of Education.
[02:06:08.416 --> 02:06:12.577]  She published a book the size of a phone book with the documents about how they're going to break up the family.
[02:06:13.098 --> 02:06:22.681]  Since the welfare state came in in the 60s, we've gone from 10 to 15 percent illegitimacy in this country to, in some different ethnic groups, over 90 percent.
[02:06:23.541 --> 02:06:25.682]  And in whites, it's almost reached 50 percent.
[02:06:25.742 --> 02:06:27.222]  In blacks, it's over 90 percent.
[02:06:28.283 --> 02:06:29.603]  And, oh, thank you, government.
[02:06:29.663 --> 02:06:31.004]  Thank you for all you do.
[02:06:31.024 --> 02:06:32.384]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[02:06:33.064 --> 02:06:34.245]  And so we're talking to
[02:06:35.291 --> 02:06:45.373]  Jeff in Pennsylvania, who says he's a CPS worker, and then he says he doesn't know that CPS workers have a 50% turnover each year, because they're not all evil.
[02:06:45.393 --> 02:06:53.555]  In fact, there was a CPS worker in New York with a whistle two years ago on how they take the little black kids and give them pesticides and some of the tests kill them.
[02:06:53.735 --> 02:06:57.596]  I mean, that's in the New York papers, boys and girls, with big pharma.
[02:06:57.876 --> 02:07:01.737]  I mean, this is nightmare on Elm Street type stuff.
[02:07:01.777 --> 02:07:04.598]  This is like coma or the island.
[02:07:05.319 --> 02:07:06.479]  I mean, this is really going on.
[02:07:06.499 --> 02:07:10.820]  This is the state, the same state that gave black men syphilis and let them spread it and die of it.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.321]  The same state that sterilized 450,000 women.
[02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:15.481]  The same Social Worker Corps.
[02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:27.404]  The Margaret Sangers of this country are the ones that took girls who were from single-parent homes with under a B+, up until the mid-eighties, and would sterilize them.
[02:07:28.865 --> 02:07:30.765]  I wonder if you support the state doing that?
[02:07:30.805 --> 02:07:34.066]  Are you into social hygiene there, Jeff?
[02:07:35.101 --> 02:07:39.544]  Well, first off, let me make an analogy here.
[02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:43.988]  The child protective system is kind of like the criminal justice system.
[02:07:44.328 --> 02:07:46.789]  And our criminal justice system isn't perfect, you know.
[02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:51.973]  There's some police officers that might violate someone's rights.
[02:07:52.353 --> 02:07:55.175]  Listen, there's a criminal court there.
[02:07:55.396 --> 02:07:57.417]  You guys have got kangaroo courts, buddy.
[02:07:57.877 --> 02:07:58.758]  We don't need you.
[02:07:58.958 --> 02:08:02.541]  If there's actual crimes being committed, then the police should be involved.
[02:08:04.890 --> 02:08:13.501]  Well, I don't think the police can be expected to deal with... Yeah, we need a special core of people like you out there.
[02:08:13.961 --> 02:08:14.742]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:08:14.782 --> 02:08:19.829]  You brought up homeschooling, and you basically said you think homeschooling should be banned?
[02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:21.491]  Well, not banned.
[02:08:21.531 --> 02:08:22.192]  I think it should be...
[02:08:23.823 --> 02:08:29.325]  Regulated for the education of the children for the quality.
[02:08:29.665 --> 02:08:31.926]  Oh yeah, you know the government brings such quality.
[02:08:32.946 --> 02:08:34.086]  Yeah, you do such a great job.
[02:08:34.546 --> 02:08:36.867]  You talk about this evil homeschool that got your kids sick?
[02:08:38.068 --> 02:08:47.331]  Well yeah, my son was playing down the street, you know, with one of his friends who is homeschooled.
[02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:49.971]  We ought to just go snatch their kids!
[02:08:49.991 --> 02:08:51.112]  That's what control freaks do!
[02:08:51.132 --> 02:08:51.672]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:08:52.375 --> 02:08:53.316]  Well, I mean, you're God.
[02:08:53.376 --> 02:08:54.496]  You make all the decisions.
[02:08:55.017 --> 02:08:56.358]  You know, I mean, you're God, man.
[02:08:56.418 --> 02:08:57.779]  Somebody died and made you God.
[02:08:58.019 --> 02:08:59.019]  No judge, no jury.
[02:08:59.259 --> 02:09:00.340]  There's just Jeff God.
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:01.021]  Here's God!
[02:09:01.241 --> 02:09:03.342]  Bow down to the new king!
[02:09:03.362 --> 02:09:04.383]  Oh, hail you!
[02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.143]  I'm sorry.
[02:09:05.243 --> 02:09:05.784]  I'm sorry.
[02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:06.544]  Tell me about the kid.
[02:09:07.905 --> 02:09:12.408]  Well, uh, my son got a really serious case of the flu.
[02:09:12.768 --> 02:09:16.871]  And I don't think... And you just know it came from that child?
[02:09:17.391 --> 02:09:18.932]  Well, there's a pretty good chance.
[02:09:18.992 --> 02:09:21.634]  I mean, he... What does that even mean, you buffoon?
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:33.402]  Well, I'm saying that the homeschool child probably didn't get the same kind of health care that the school offers.
[02:09:33.502 --> 02:09:40.263]  And that child is without those protections.
[02:09:40.283 --> 02:09:43.364]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:09:43.404 --> 02:09:44.124]  I'm just curious.
[02:09:44.904 --> 02:09:46.604]  And to be clear, I don't care what education you got.
[02:09:46.644 --> 02:09:49.365]  I'm just curious, what medical education do you have?
[02:09:51.792 --> 02:09:53.372]  Didn't take any medical classes.
[02:09:53.412 --> 02:09:55.273]  Let me just give you a little news flash here.
[02:09:55.473 --> 02:09:56.713]  This is Associated Press.
[02:09:57.133 --> 02:10:06.875]  The last five flu seasons in a row, the variant flu mutation that they mass-produced was not for the main flu strain.
[02:10:07.295 --> 02:10:10.116]  Okay, so number one, there's no law you've got to take a flu shot.
[02:10:10.836 --> 02:10:16.837]  Number two, the last five years it hasn't even matched the mutation of the actual flu that hits North America.
[02:10:16.857 --> 02:10:18.058]  Okay, that's admitted.
[02:10:18.178 --> 02:10:19.058]  It's called FACTS.
[02:10:19.904 --> 02:10:38.911]  And number three, you have no idea where your son got the flu, but you are like somebody who says throw the Jew down the well in the Middle Ages because the Jews knew to eat garlic and take different medicinals so they didn't die of the plague, and so they went and grabbed the Jews and threw them down the well because they were ignorant!
[02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:39.992]  They were ignorant!
[02:10:42.292 --> 02:10:49.035]  So you're saying that the flu vaccinations don't protect against the flu?
[02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:53.604]  That's exactly what Tommy Thompson said three years ago.
[02:10:53.624 --> 02:10:55.185]  That's exactly what's all over the news.
[02:10:55.225 --> 02:10:56.927]  You didn't hear about the big scandal?
[02:10:58.308 --> 02:11:00.349]  That's not what our family doctor said.
[02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:04.533]  That's not what your family doctor, who just does exactly what the AMA says?
[02:11:05.985 --> 02:11:10.346]  Oh, so your family doctor will just roll your sleeve up and you give you and your son?
[02:11:10.546 --> 02:11:12.446]  You know, that's how you people curse yourselves.
[02:11:12.707 --> 02:11:15.927]  You believe in this system that has come to kill, steal, and destroy you.
[02:11:16.587 --> 02:11:18.028]  And you just go ahead and believe.
[02:11:18.068 --> 02:11:19.108]  Just take your mercury.
[02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:21.148]  Do you believe mercury is good for children's brains?
[02:11:21.188 --> 02:11:23.149]  Because federal studies have shown that.
[02:11:24.289 --> 02:11:26.990]  Well, I don't think that mercury is safe.
[02:11:27.710 --> 02:11:28.950]  Oh, excuse me!
[02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:31.091]  Your all-powerful state says so.
[02:11:31.111 --> 02:11:32.951]  Can you cue up the mercury nutritious clip, please?
[02:11:35.334 --> 02:11:39.461]  Oh, so again, sir, do you just trust the whole... This is so sick.
[02:11:39.982 --> 02:11:40.483]  You know something?
[02:11:40.563 --> 02:11:45.352]  I have been at the hospital with a family whose first child was taken because they were poor.
[02:11:46.067 --> 02:11:50.788]  And they're there to have another child, and they openly... I got the court filings.
[02:11:51.228 --> 02:11:52.689]  I did a whole TV show on it.
[02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:54.669]  I ought to grab that tape and put it on the web.
[02:11:54.689 --> 02:11:56.830]  In fact, Mike Hanson, you're listening, you've got a copy of that.
[02:11:57.210 --> 02:11:59.431]  CPS grabs kids show.
[02:11:59.771 --> 02:12:01.211]  I want to put that on the web for folks to see.
[02:12:01.251 --> 02:12:06.933]  We're there, with a video camera, and a cop grabs the woman around the throat and makes her sign a form.
[02:12:07.253 --> 02:12:11.214]  Again, the Soviet Union, they tortured you underground, secretly, to sign forms.
[02:12:11.474 --> 02:12:13.756]  In America, they think forcing people to sign.
[02:12:14.016 --> 02:12:14.357]  Why?
[02:12:14.557 --> 02:12:17.700]  Because they have to force you because it's not due process.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.001]  It's racketeering.
[02:12:19.021 --> 02:12:24.186]  Now let me ask you, do you go around when the poor people are dumb enough to go have their kids at a government hospital?
[02:12:24.486 --> 02:12:25.727]  Are you there snatching their kids?
[02:12:27.409 --> 02:12:31.293]  I've never... well, a couple times, you know.
[02:12:32.774 --> 02:12:40.878]  I've tried to be calm with them and explain to them about the paperwork, but you know, that can be pretty hard if they don't understand what they're getting into.
[02:12:41.018 --> 02:12:46.221]  So, I mean, I don't... I'm not forcible, if that's what you mean.
[02:12:47.421 --> 02:12:48.022]  Listen to me!
[02:12:48.062 --> 02:12:48.622]  Listen to me!
[02:12:48.862 --> 02:12:54.645]  What I'm saying to you is don't you understand that you don't have the power to take them until you trick them into signing?
[02:12:54.825 --> 02:12:56.646]  Don't you understand that's totally un-American?
[02:12:58.874 --> 02:13:02.517]  Well, I don't get my powers from any documents.
[02:13:02.537 --> 02:13:07.001]  You know, it comes from the same type of authority that a police officer might have, you know?
[02:13:07.021 --> 02:13:07.821]  No!
[02:13:07.921 --> 02:13:12.625]  You're there tricking them to sign over custody to you, you freak!
[02:13:14.127 --> 02:13:21.293]  Well, you know, again, you have to explain to the parents that it's really for their child.
[02:13:22.534 --> 02:13:22.794]  You know,
[02:13:24.595 --> 02:13:33.788]  We do it for the children, and we have a child protective service system that works, and you're trying to bat it down.
[02:13:34.269 --> 02:13:37.854]  And there's a lot of positive things that we do that you don't talk about.
[02:13:37.874 --> 02:13:38.995]  You're just talking about the data.
[02:13:39.075 --> 02:13:40.798]  Okay, tell us all the positive stuff you do.
[02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:49.910]  Well, first off, you know, you look in the news, there's tons of stories about babies being thrown in dumpsters.
[02:13:49.970 --> 02:13:55.511]  Yeah, the media, yeah, the media hypes the hell out of that and they should be criminally charged, okay?
[02:13:56.371 --> 02:14:01.512]  Of course there's criminal stuff going on, sir, but listen, I know wealthy people, okay?
[02:14:01.552 --> 02:14:04.333]  I mean folks that are living in $2 million, $3 million houses.
[02:14:04.673 --> 02:14:11.134]  I mean people that make a lot of money, who wear, you know, Brooks Brothers suits, whose children are totally taken care of immaculately.
[02:14:11.574 --> 02:14:19.301]  And one of them is three years old and jumps off the jungle gym and breaks a finger and CPS is at the hospital trying to snatch him!
[02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:34.534]  My father is an oral surgeon and a dentist and when I was at the pool, when I was about 12 years old and partially tore my shoulder out of place, my dad going to the hospital where he worked said, son, and he was concerned, he said, they're going to ask how this happened?
[02:14:34.774 --> 02:14:36.115]  They may call in CPS?
[02:14:36.155 --> 02:14:39.438]  And my father was concerned because he works around you freaks!
[02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:48.014]  Well, if something happened that was an accident, you know, CPS shouldn't get involved.
[02:14:48.254 --> 02:14:49.755]  No, you decide!
[02:14:49.795 --> 02:14:51.296]  CPS is there all the time!
[02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:54.759]  Well, it's not entirely our decision.
[02:14:54.779 --> 02:15:09.208]  Yeah, I know, they threaten the doctors and tell them that they're liable if anything, you know, that happens, you know, they're liable for not reporting it, so the doctors are turning into little secret police officers.
[02:15:10.199 --> 02:15:11.780]  Well, I wouldn't say that.
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:24.168]  The doctors are very independent and, you know, offer their recommendations to me as to what happens in cases that involve injuries like that.
[02:15:24.929 --> 02:15:30.092]  But I don't think that we should just give up on the CPS.
[02:15:30.153 --> 02:15:32.654]  You need to have... Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[02:15:32.914 --> 02:15:34.996]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, due process.
[02:15:35.916 --> 02:15:41.418]  Okay, you guys are outside the law, and you may not understand that, but you need to get back inside the law.
[02:15:42.999 --> 02:15:44.560]  So you're saying we're not in the law?
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:46.060]  Yeah, you're not inside the law.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:47.701]  Family courts are a fraud.
[02:15:47.721 --> 02:15:52.403]  Let me stop you.
[02:15:52.463 --> 02:16:04.308]  I reposted a newscast from three years ago where Judge Gene Mear, who has a juvenile justice center named after her, when the children are late to class three times, they illegally, and we went before the legislature on this, they're trying to change it,
[02:16:05.504 --> 02:16:11.027]  They claim that's a truancy, but one absence is not a truancy and being late three times is not an absence.
[02:16:11.627 --> 02:16:14.889]  And then she sits there and tricks the parents and says, okay, sign this form.
[02:16:15.209 --> 02:16:16.950]  Your child will now be on probation.
[02:16:16.970 --> 02:16:18.771]  If they do one thing wrong, I'm going to take them.
[02:16:19.411 --> 02:16:22.933]  And the parents are in there in the portable building where she holds court with the other judges.
[02:16:23.293 --> 02:16:31.438]  And then they, and then they're busy tricking them to get into administrative law court to, uh, to, to basically go on to probation when no crime's even been committed.
[02:16:32.018 --> 02:16:33.839]  It's called contract fraud, Bubba.
[02:16:34.722 --> 02:16:38.105]  It's like you tricked some, you know, body to basically become a sharecropper.
[02:16:39.886 --> 02:16:59.802]  Well, I think that, um, you have a couple of these cases that come up, and, uh, you know, there are criminal, uh, workers out there, you know, just a guy last week was, uh, fired, um, uh, at the office that I work at, but, uh, you know, these things happen.
[02:16:59.862 --> 02:17:00.722]  What was he fired for?
[02:17:04.294 --> 02:17:06.497]  I don't think I can discuss that on the air.
[02:17:06.517 --> 02:17:07.958]  Well, let me just tell you something, sir.
[02:17:08.539 --> 02:17:15.386]  There's a lot of people like you who have been conditioned and think because you're not an evil person that everything else around you isn't corrupt.
[02:17:16.127 --> 02:17:26.117]  And you need to stop being naive and you need to find out the fact about your industry that it's there to break up families, to hop kids up on drugs, because you get more federal funding when you do it.
[02:17:27.029 --> 02:17:29.171]  Okay, and what I'm talking about is reality.
[02:17:29.751 --> 02:17:34.155]  I appreciate you calling, I hope you'll call in again sometime, but I'm sorry I called you a bunch of names.
[02:17:34.855 --> 02:17:39.399]  I just, I detest people that abuse children, and you're the biggest abusers out there.
[02:17:39.419 --> 02:17:45.824]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:48.115 --> 02:17:52.938]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:53.158 --> 02:17:55.880]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:17:55.940 --> 02:17:57.060]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:17:58.381 --> 02:18:02.984]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:03.904 --> 02:18:11.189]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:12.169 --> 02:18:15.231]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:20.825]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:21.806 --> 02:18:23.087]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:23.327 --> 02:18:25.549]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:26.611 --> 02:18:32.457]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:33.157 --> 02:18:33.438]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:33.458 --> 02:18:33.778]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:50.254]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[02:18:51.095 --> 02:18:55.019]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[02:18:55.659 --> 02:19:04.008]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?

[02:21:47.262 --> 02:21:50.165]  This song is for you, the last guy to call, and your whole ilk.
[02:21:50.766 --> 02:21:51.987]  All the people in this government.
[02:21:52.267 --> 02:21:53.989]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:21:54.089 --> 02:21:54.670]  Here it is.
[02:21:54.690 --> 02:21:58.874]  Every breath you take.
[02:22:00.335 --> 02:22:02.617]  Every move you make.
[02:22:03.418 --> 02:22:06.121]  Every point you make.
[02:22:06.241 --> 02:22:07.703]  Every step you take.
[02:22:07.783 --> 02:22:08.844]  I'll be watching you.
[02:22:34.002 --> 02:22:36.084]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[02:22:36.184 --> 02:22:37.645]  Let's try to blitz through some of your calls.
[02:22:37.705 --> 02:22:38.566]  And I got a guest coming up.
[02:22:38.586 --> 02:22:39.627]  I want to get back into Chaney.
[02:22:39.667 --> 02:22:40.667]  Will he be kicked out?
[02:22:42.549 --> 02:22:45.852]  Well, let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Connecticut.
[02:22:46.112 --> 02:22:49.014]  Then we'll talk to Dustin, Thomas, and others.
[02:22:49.054 --> 02:22:50.315]  Go ahead, Greg.
[02:22:51.196 --> 02:22:51.997]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:22:52.037 --> 02:22:52.457]  How are you?
[02:22:53.017 --> 02:22:53.218]  Good.
[02:22:53.258 --> 02:22:54.639]  I was talking to the folks running the show.
[02:22:54.679 --> 02:22:55.940]  That guy was for real.
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:58.001]  They were talking to him during the break.
[02:22:58.061 --> 02:23:03.506]  I mean, that just... The type of low-grade morons we got out there that don't even know the evil system they're in.
[02:23:04.196 --> 02:23:04.897]  Unbelievable.
[02:23:06.299 --> 02:23:12.848]  And I just wanted to say, you know, you're number two on, if you go to shoutcast.com, you're number two on the list for talk radio.
[02:23:12.968 --> 02:23:14.270]  Well, that's just one of our streams.
[02:23:14.290 --> 02:23:17.354]  If you combine our streams, I'm always number one, but thank you.
[02:23:18.112 --> 02:23:18.692]  All right, awesome.
[02:23:18.832 --> 02:23:39.859]  And, uh, you know, I was just, uh, I was looking at this, uh, blog and, uh, you know, Bush, you know, before, before the elections, he said, yeah, uh, Rumsfeld's gonna stay with me to the end, you know, and then two days later, you know, he says, all right, Rumsfeld's out, you know, he just obviously lies, you know, and then, uh... And political strategists have said that if he would have outed him two weeks before, Republicans would have held on to more seats.
[02:23:39.959 --> 02:23:41.540]  Again, this is by design.
[02:23:42.313 --> 02:23:53.942]  Uh, you know, my, uh, my Senator, uh, Senator Lieberman, he wanted an independent, you know, he used to be a Democrat, and now he's saying that, you know, I'm not, you know, uh, being a Republican is a possibility.
[02:23:53.982 --> 02:23:55.883]  I'm not, I'm not, you know, boxing that out.
[02:23:55.903 --> 02:23:57.444]  I'm definitely looking into that.
[02:23:57.504 --> 02:24:02.228]  So then, if he does that, then they're going to be the majority in the, you know, in the state.
[02:24:02.348 --> 02:24:08.913]  Well, yeah, it'll be, it'll be 50-50, and then you'll have, uh, Lord Cheney as the tiebreaker.
[02:24:09.699 --> 02:24:10.139]  That's right.
[02:24:10.319 --> 02:24:12.020]  And then one more thing.
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:15.521]  You said you forgot what you were going to say before that commercial break.
[02:24:15.601 --> 02:24:19.762]  You were about to talk about 30 million immigrants about the borders and everything.
[02:24:19.862 --> 02:24:20.722]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:20.922 --> 02:24:22.303]  Listen, I really appreciate your call.
[02:24:22.343 --> 02:24:23.123]  Thanks for reminding me.
[02:24:23.163 --> 02:24:25.004]  On the first hour, I said, I'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:24:25.044 --> 02:24:27.485]  And I got back and I said, what was it I was going to talk about?
[02:24:27.505 --> 02:24:31.726]  This broadcast is the opposite of scripted, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:32.964 --> 02:24:41.006]  Yeah, the 30 million illegal aliens, at least half of them are radicals who believe this is Mexico, who openly talk about violent revolution.
[02:24:41.826 --> 02:24:45.847]  The Ford Foundation, the federal government, and others are clearly in control of these groups.
[02:24:46.427 --> 02:24:48.747]  And the globalists can crash the economy when they want.
[02:24:48.807 --> 02:24:53.568]  They can create some provocation instantly and have every major U.S.
[02:24:53.588 --> 02:24:56.529]  city burned to the ground by the illegal aliens.
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:00.860]  So the New World Order's got some aces in the hole here.
[02:25:01.261 --> 02:25:03.101]  We're sure the American people are waking up.
[02:25:03.841 --> 02:25:06.541]  There's a grassroots populist move against globalism.
[02:25:07.622 --> 02:25:09.382]  But at the same time, we're not out of the woods yet.
[02:25:09.442 --> 02:25:13.143]  So, this illegal alien problem, and what's Bush doing?
[02:25:13.343 --> 02:25:16.683]  Amnesty, which is his quote, guest worker program.
[02:25:17.383 --> 02:25:20.024]  It's just, here it comes with Pelosi.
[02:25:20.544 --> 02:25:20.724]  Ha!
[02:25:21.564 --> 02:25:26.825]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dustin in Deutschland.
[02:25:26.865 --> 02:25:27.565]  Dustin, welcome.
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.281]  Alex, what's going on, buddy?
[02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:32.561]  Doing a worldwide broadcast.
[02:25:33.381 --> 02:25:34.262]  I know that's right.
[02:25:34.462 --> 02:25:36.843]  Hey, you talk about positive things happening.
[02:25:38.083 --> 02:25:42.965]  Going on here on this front, the Battle of the Bulge over here in Europe.
[02:25:43.505 --> 02:25:50.007]  We got some copies of Freedom to Fascism available for the soldiers to buy.
[02:25:50.507 --> 02:25:53.848]  And they came in last week and over the weekend they sold out.
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:59.730]  So we're, we're waking the soldiers up over here, putting the stake right through the heart of the New World Order.
[02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:00.131]  No, that's it!
[02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:01.052]  How they gonna fight us?
[02:26:01.413 --> 02:26:04.138]  How they gonna fight us if the Army's on our side?
[02:26:04.158 --> 02:26:04.920]  Heh heh!
[02:26:08.974 --> 02:26:22.858]  I totally agree with you, and that's why, whether it's Terrorist Storm, or whether it's American Freedom from Fascism, whatever it is, get them!
[02:26:23.278 --> 02:26:23.979]  Make copies!
[02:26:24.139 --> 02:26:25.279]  No, they can't stop us!
[02:26:25.499 --> 02:26:26.599]  Basically, it's like football.
[02:26:26.859 --> 02:26:28.280]  They cannot stop the run.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.080]  Alex, what
[02:26:54.416 --> 02:26:59.961]  What we need to do right now is like the perfect time for just like all of us to just like unify.
[02:26:59.981 --> 02:27:00.702]  You know what I mean?
[02:27:00.742 --> 02:27:06.167]  Because I'm a little concerned right now with all the rats that are leaving the sneaking ship.
[02:27:06.688 --> 02:27:07.568]  You know what I mean?
[02:27:07.929 --> 02:27:08.970]  We got to unify.
[02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:13.394]  Don't take our eyes off of them and don't let them try to sneak out the back door.
[02:27:13.434 --> 02:27:13.754]  I agree.
[02:27:13.774 --> 02:27:15.176]  They're more dangerous than ever.
[02:27:15.216 --> 02:27:16.577]  I appreciate you calling from Germany.
[02:27:16.617 --> 02:27:17.698]  Call back anytime.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.101]  Got a guest coming up.

[02:27:21.703 --> 02:27:22.464]  Stay the course.
[02:27:22.504 --> 02:27:23.585]  The final 30 minutes.
[02:27:23.905 --> 02:27:24.746]  Straight ahead!
[02:27:30.512 --> 02:27:31.432]  We're on the march.
[02:27:31.893 --> 02:27:33.494]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.415 --> 02:27:37.118]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:46.651]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:46.671 --> 02:27:49.275]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business.
[02:27:55.029 --> 02:27:56.690]  Globalism is nationalism.
[02:27:57.090 --> 02:27:59.092]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.

[02:28:40.285 --> 02:28:47.870]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:55.235]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:28:55.355 --> 02:29:05.582]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when
[02:29:05.742 --> 02:29:06.362]  I think so.
[02:29:36.002 --> 02:29:39.203]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:42.444 --> 02:29:46.586]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:46.806 --> 02:29:48.566]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:48.827 --> 02:29:54.869]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatter.
[02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:59.310]  Raymond Reif discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:29:59.550 --> 02:30:01.391]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:01.671 --> 02:30:01.952]  I think?

[02:30:28.015 --> 02:30:28.235]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:28.255 --> 02:30:28.315]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:51.489 --> 02:31:15.848]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[02:31:18.098 --> 02:31:21.199]  Welcome back!
[02:31:21.799 --> 02:31:25.861]  That's right, at the end of our lives,
[02:31:45.399 --> 02:31:47.300]  It's all just going to be an empire of dirt.
[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:48.701]  You better do the right thing while you live.
[02:31:48.721 --> 02:31:51.803]  The man who dies with the most toys loses.
[02:31:51.883 --> 02:31:53.364]  It's who stands up and does the right thing.
[02:31:53.404 --> 02:31:54.104]  It's what we build.
[02:31:54.184 --> 02:31:55.125]  It's who we are.
[02:31:55.145 --> 02:31:56.445]  It's standing up for little people.
[02:31:56.846 --> 02:31:57.846]  That's what life's all about.
[02:31:58.006 --> 02:31:59.567]  Okay.
[02:31:59.707 --> 02:32:05.310]  The Democrats, Pelosi and others, are totally bought and paid for by the very same global lobbyist.
[02:32:06.051 --> 02:32:09.513]  And I told everybody, you watch, they're going to go in there and they're not going to do a single thing.
[02:32:10.507 --> 02:32:14.294]  And even if we twist their arms, I would look for them to go after Bush on some little side issue.
[02:32:14.314 --> 02:32:16.438]  We have him dead to rights on the Downing Street Memo.
[02:32:16.739 --> 02:32:20.687]  But forget the Downing Street Memo, the White House Memo is even that much stronger.
[02:32:22.268 --> 02:32:27.412]  And we don't hear the Democrats now, at least the mainstream ones, saying repeal H.R.
[02:32:27.612 --> 02:32:41.401]  6166, Military Commissions Act, repeal the Military Authorization Act that ends posse comitatus, no talk of Patriot Act, and I guess when we get a Hillary in there, Democrats will suddenly be pro-war, pro-torture, pro-world government.
[02:32:42.321 --> 02:32:47.004]  I mean, it's like Republicans abandon every value they had because George Bush got in office.
[02:32:47.085 --> 02:32:49.006]  It's not about these puppets.
[02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:55.335]  Joining us, and I appreciate him coming on, is David Swanson, and he helped set up Aberdowningstreet.org.
[02:32:55.375 --> 02:33:00.779]  He also is the Washington Director of Democrats.com and the ImpeachPact.org.
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:04.943]  He's the creator of Meet with Cindy and a board member of Progressive Democrats of America.
[02:33:05.343 --> 02:33:13.350]  He's worked as a newspaper reporter and as a communications director with jobs including press secretary for Dennis Kucinich,
[02:33:14.356 --> 02:33:14.797]  I think?
[02:33:34.657 --> 02:33:36.459]  A power-sharing deal has been made.
[02:33:37.219 --> 02:33:38.200]  Where's all this going?
[02:33:38.260 --> 02:33:43.264]  And you're inside the system, you know, with a bird's-eye view, kind of from the progressive wing.
[02:33:43.624 --> 02:33:44.465]  What do you see happening?
[02:33:45.895 --> 02:33:49.336]  Well, I certainly see the progressive wing having grown in the election.
[02:33:49.356 --> 02:33:51.857]  There are more progressive Democrats in Congress.
[02:33:51.877 --> 02:33:58.360]  There are dozens of Democrats in Congress who are talking about the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act and so forth.
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:04.662]  That being said, there are dozens who are not, including the leadership, Pelosi, Dean, Emanuel, the rest of them.
[02:34:05.263 --> 02:34:09.004]  And for Nancy Pelosi or Emanuel or Conyers or anyone,
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:13.101]  To say that impeachment is off the table is a disgrace.
[02:34:13.361 --> 02:34:15.522]  It's to tear up the Constitution.
[02:34:15.982 --> 02:34:35.389]  Even if we didn't know already of overwhelming evidence of impeachable offenses, to suggest that you're going to do investigations but you will somehow forbid them from arriving at impeachment is to ignore key sections of the Constitution and your duty as a member of Congress.
[02:34:36.675 --> 02:34:41.857]  Again, that being said, I'm not depressed or defeated or pessimistic.
[02:34:41.957 --> 02:34:48.360]  I actually am increasingly confident, as many people are, that we are going to get to impeachment.
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:35:00.424]  But to do it will require a movement from American people of the sort that forced Nixon to leave town.
[02:35:00.685 --> 02:35:04.206]  Well, there was also that grassroots movement going after Clinton.
[02:35:06.168 --> 02:35:07.569]  Well, in a way.
[02:35:07.629 --> 02:35:10.691]  I mean, it was sort of a grass-tops movement.
[02:35:10.751 --> 02:35:14.213]  I mean, public support for impeaching Clinton never got above 37%.
[02:35:14.313 --> 02:35:18.155]  No, but I'm saying there were a lot of conservatives on the ground lobbying for it.
[02:35:20.376 --> 02:35:22.097]  A lot is a vague term.
[02:35:22.117 --> 02:35:27.240]  There were certainly conservatives in key places lobbying for it.
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:31.242]  But it did serious damage to our country.
[02:35:31.262 --> 02:35:32.123]  I don't care about Clinton.
[02:35:32.163 --> 02:35:34.184]  I wanted him impeached for some serious reasons.
[02:35:35.126 --> 02:35:44.652]  to take the process of impeachment and turn it into a witch hunt over somebody lying under oath about their sex life damages
[02:35:45.732 --> 02:35:48.874]  Our constitutional system and the role that impeachment plays.
[02:35:48.954 --> 02:36:02.424]  And now, people see impeachment as a joke, see it as a distraction, see it as slowing down useful activities, and imagine that impeachment is all about technical legalities of whether you lied under oath.
[02:36:02.484 --> 02:36:05.326]  And people are telling me all the time, oh, Bush didn't lie under oath.
[02:36:05.426 --> 02:36:06.887]  What is, what is, yeah.
[02:36:10.029 --> 02:36:10.669]  Ridiculous.
[02:36:10.849 --> 02:36:21.353]  Impeachment is about somebody setting up a unitary executive and saying they have dictatorial powers and having their viceroys write memos saying they can torture children with pliers.
[02:36:22.093 --> 02:36:22.693]  Exactly.
[02:36:22.913 --> 02:36:28.015]  Impeachment is about abuses of power and threats to our system of government.
[02:36:29.130 --> 02:36:37.276]  Bush has committed endless crimes, among them intentionally misleading Congress in writing and orally, which is a felony.
[02:36:37.317 --> 02:36:40.339]  You don't have to lie under oath to break the law.
[02:36:40.399 --> 02:36:45.163]  But lying to the public is not a crime, and it is an impeachable offense.
[02:36:45.203 --> 02:36:46.704]  Well, David, this audience knows that.
[02:36:46.744 --> 02:36:56.552]  What I want to get at is how do we get the impeachment process to take place without anthrax hitting the Capitol again, Bush launching that, or, you know, a bunch of small plane crashes
[02:36:57.072 --> 02:36:58.453]  With members of Congress on board.
[02:36:58.913 --> 02:36:59.813]  How do we stop?
[02:37:00.174 --> 02:37:04.896]  I mean, I think they also know in the Congress that Bush isn't playing around and is a crime family.
[02:37:05.476 --> 02:37:09.819]  And it's also quite dangerous to go up against President Bush.
[02:37:09.859 --> 02:37:12.800]  Plus, the top Democrats are telling us, oh, James Baker is wonderful.
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:17.242]  He's here with his independent commission, the Iraq Study Group, to save us.
[02:37:17.923 --> 02:37:26.367]  And so now they're just going to try to put the whole debate into this big discussion and try to neutralize populist momentum against what these people are doing.
[02:37:27.331 --> 02:37:32.697]  Yeah, and that commission may not come out with anything in the end, but we have to do two things, I think.
[02:37:33.077 --> 02:37:41.687]  We have to do an inside strategy and an outside strategy, and the inside strategy is pushing the Democrats hard to start the right investigations.
[02:37:41.847 --> 02:37:45.190]  Investigations that we know will end up at impeachment.
[02:37:46.251 --> 02:37:47.733]  And the outside part is
[02:37:48.403 --> 02:37:57.329]  is not backing off an inch, not turning our rhetoric into investigations, but building a public uproar for impeachment.
[02:37:57.549 --> 02:38:00.151]  They have to know that that's what we want.
[02:38:00.651 --> 02:38:05.014]  And so we've got a huge coalition built, bigger than we've ever had before.
[02:38:05.114 --> 02:38:10.738]  People are actually optimistic, and we've set up a website impeachforchange.org.
[02:38:11.358 --> 02:38:13.559]  We're still using afterdowningstreet.org.
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:15.661]  We're launching a petition drive.
[02:38:15.721 --> 02:38:17.622]  We're going to collect millions of signatures.
[02:38:18.092 --> 02:38:28.115]  We're organizing people to lobby their Congress members now, and we're planning events everywhere in the country on December 10th, which is a Sunday, and it's Human Rights Day.
[02:38:28.135 --> 02:38:30.515]  We're making it Human Rights and Impeachment Day.
[02:38:30.855 --> 02:38:39.797]  We're going to have town hall forums and rallies and vigils that day, and organize and organize and organize, and in January, get people to D.C.
[02:38:40.418 --> 02:38:44.979]  lobbying and protesting and fitting in and raising hell, and
[02:38:46.181 --> 02:38:47.022]  We're going to get there.
[02:38:47.223 --> 02:38:49.345]  I actually think we're going to get there.
[02:38:49.385 --> 02:38:56.235]  And if we get the investigations going and we don't get to impeachment, that's still ahead of where we were.
[02:38:56.255 --> 02:39:01.121]  And if we get impeachment but we don't get removal from office, that's still two steps ahead of where we were.
[02:39:01.301 --> 02:39:03.845]  Yeah, David Swanson, why do you think
[02:39:04.611 --> 02:39:06.832]  Pelosi and others didn't at least pay lip service.
[02:39:06.872 --> 02:39:07.973]  Why do you think instantly?
[02:39:07.993 --> 02:39:11.975]  I mean, now, in fact, I said Wednesday, I said, she's already had a meeting with Bush.
[02:39:12.015 --> 02:39:13.436]  It's the exact same talking points.
[02:39:13.916 --> 02:39:18.439]  It turns out at about 7.50 something in the morning, they had a long talk.
[02:39:18.519 --> 02:39:22.421]  They all, you know, Howard Dean and Pelosi and Bush's people.
[02:39:23.222 --> 02:39:26.263]  Bush talked to Pelosi, then he had her over the next day for lunch.
[02:39:26.804 --> 02:39:30.946]  I mean, they were on the same page before the Senate was even decided.
[02:39:31.927 --> 02:39:33.428]  In Virginia and Montana.
[02:39:33.448 --> 02:39:34.528]  This is disgusting!
[02:39:35.268 --> 02:39:39.930]  Well, Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat, and Democrats don't know how to think, and they like to lose.
[02:39:40.310 --> 02:39:49.834]  And, you know, if the Democrats hadn't held off on impeachment under Reagan with Iran-Contra, they wouldn't have lost that next election so horribly.
[02:39:50.174 --> 02:39:50.934]  They would have won.
[02:39:50.954 --> 02:39:55.156]  You look back through history, pushing impeachment is good for you politically.
[02:39:55.216 --> 02:39:59.798]  When the Republicans tried to impeach Truman, it was good for them in the next election.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:15.731]  Nancy Pelosi doesn't understand what's smart politically, but, you know, it's a weird situation, because looking back at past cases, the leadership has always gone in saying, we're not interested in impeachment, we just want investigations, and then they get to impeachment.
[02:40:16.211 --> 02:40:24.817]  But here, the evidence of impeachable offenses is staring us all in the face before the investigations start, and so nobody believes it, and it looks
[02:40:27.123 --> 02:40:29.143]  What about a war crimes court in Germany?
[02:40:29.163 --> 02:40:35.866]  There's 11 plaintiffs who were tortured at Abu Ghraib under memos and orders given by Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:40:35.886 --> 02:40:39.467]  Will that help if Rumsfeld is indicted in absentia?
[02:40:41.182 --> 02:40:44.945]  It will help the world to have some accountability for a criminal like Donald Trump.
[02:40:45.445 --> 02:40:57.973]  Well, exactly, but will that be a focusing lens here domestically of reminding people it isn't about lying, even about WMDs, it is about torture, but at the same time it is about lying at a certain level.
[02:40:58.433 --> 02:41:00.715]  It will be if it gets onto American television.
[02:41:00.775 --> 02:41:09.320]  I don't think it has yet, but interestingly, Pelosi's announcing that Congress won't do anything helps the chances of that case in Germany.
[02:41:09.673 --> 02:41:16.376]  Where they have been reluctant in the past to take it up because they've argued that Congress would do it.
[02:41:16.956 --> 02:41:20.158]  So, you know, there is a little silver lining there.
[02:41:20.198 --> 02:41:24.780]  I mean, they'll have investigations, exactly, they'll have investigations over nothing in Congress.
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:34.305]  We're not going to have investigations about lying about WMDs, going to war, covering up 9-11, HR 6166, but that's the really bad thing.
[02:41:34.745 --> 02:41:36.265]  Most Democrats voted for HR 6166.
[02:41:38.879 --> 02:41:40.002]  Which is disgusting.
[02:41:40.062 --> 02:41:45.719]  It is absolutely disgraceful and did not help them in the election and I'm hopeful that they don't think it did.
[02:41:46.161 --> 02:41:54.648]  But there are many, many Democrats openly talking now about serious investigations into the lies that sold us this war.
[02:41:54.688 --> 02:41:56.250]  Well, I agree, but let me ask you this question.
[02:41:56.310 --> 02:42:02.135]  What's going to happen in two years if the Democrats haven't had the investigation, haven't at least tried impeachment?
[02:42:02.675 --> 02:42:12.664]  A lot of the political experts on both sides of the aisle are saying that this is a third force, a huge populist movement in America, and that they will go after the Democrats too if they don't do their job.
[02:42:13.792 --> 02:42:16.116]  Well, the Democrats will lose the elections.
[02:42:16.677 --> 02:42:22.986]  I personally will refuse to have my name associated with the word Democrat in any way, shape, or form from here until I die.
[02:42:25.934 --> 02:42:34.796]  Most important result will be that we will have set up a system that says it's okay for future presidents to lie us into wars and torture us.
[02:42:35.016 --> 02:42:35.656]  Exactly!
[02:42:35.696 --> 02:42:36.457]  That's my point!
[02:42:36.537 --> 02:42:37.757]  We have to fight this!
[02:42:38.017 --> 02:42:45.759]  Because if we don't, they're going to set in stone secret arrests of citizens, torture, preemptive imperial wars.
[02:42:46.279 --> 02:42:47.539]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:42:47.579 --> 02:42:49.820]  We've got to bring these criminals to justice!
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:50.861]  Yeah.
[02:42:51.521 --> 02:42:54.803]  A friend of mine, Dave Lindorff, made the point the other day in Philadelphia.
[02:42:54.823 --> 02:42:55.564]  We had a huge event.
[02:42:55.584 --> 02:43:04.370]  He said, I would be in for impeachment if it was the day before the 2008 election to get it in there, because we can't let this precedent stand.
[02:43:06.031 --> 02:43:06.692]  Well, exactly.
[02:43:06.712 --> 02:43:15.538]  You know, folks are saying that it's good that the Democrats won because it repudiates the war and torture and all the rest of this, but that's not going to last in the world's eyes if somebody isn't punished.
[02:43:16.098 --> 02:43:19.601]  In fact, it'll show them that we're basically a reprobate country.
[02:43:20.271 --> 02:43:23.673]  Well, you know, that election is a start, it's not a finish.
[02:43:23.994 --> 02:43:36.522]  And we've got progressive left-wing activist groups now arguing, well, we won the election, now let's be positive and forward-looking and cooperative and that will help us win the next election.
[02:43:36.542 --> 02:43:41.685]  Yeah, I've had them criticizing me and others just saying, let's work with Bush.
[02:43:41.806 --> 02:43:42.946]  Oh, he's being nice!
[02:43:43.427 --> 02:43:47.409]  You don't work with a dictator and the public didn't ask anybody to.
[02:43:47.449 --> 02:43:49.871]  The Republicans didn't win a single new seat.
[02:43:50.410 --> 02:43:52.331]  The Democrats won overwhelmingly.
[02:43:52.351 --> 02:43:54.093]  This is not a mandate for cooperation.
[02:43:54.153 --> 02:44:02.318]  Oh yeah, I heard Nancy and the Republican spin masters saying, this is the message they want bipartisanship, this is the message they want us to work together and fix things.
[02:44:02.699 --> 02:44:03.199]  Bull!
[02:44:03.399 --> 02:44:05.901]  We want George Bush and his cronies to go to prison!
[02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:07.250]  That's right.
[02:44:07.451 --> 02:44:07.951]  That's right.
[02:44:08.051 --> 02:44:17.559]  And that's the other potential benefit of real investigations, whether we get impeachment or not, is dragging out the facts that will be useful in criminal indictments.
[02:44:18.399 --> 02:44:22.142]  And we need criminal indictments of Bush, Cheney, and more.
[02:44:22.302 --> 02:44:32.170]  Let me ask you a question, David Swanson, whose website is davidswanson.org, and he's one of the biggest organizers in the alternative left or progressives in this country.
[02:44:32.190 --> 02:44:32.911]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:44:35.066 --> 02:44:37.629]  Do you think George Bush would let it go that far?
[02:44:37.669 --> 02:44:39.451]  Or would he try to start a war with Iran?
[02:44:39.471 --> 02:44:44.676]  Would he pull some other type of rabbit out of a hat to divert us and get us all to rally back around him?
[02:44:45.157 --> 02:44:47.920]  Is things really getting dangerous for him?
[02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:59.177]  Well, I wouldn't put anything past him, but they saw this election coming and they held off on starting a war with Iran, so it is possible that we can restrain them.
[02:45:00.538 --> 02:45:01.058]  We'll see.
[02:45:01.338 --> 02:45:11.606]  I certainly wouldn't put it past him, and I certainly don't put stealing the next election past them, although they failed pretty much across the board this time.
[02:45:12.087 --> 02:45:16.750]  I've seen a lot of real-line conservatives, too, are also supporting impeachment.
[02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:17.511]  Were you aware of that?
[02:45:18.243 --> 02:45:24.531]  There are a great many conservatives, a great many republicans, and former republicans who won't call themselves republicans anymore.
[02:45:24.891 --> 02:45:35.804]  There are, of course, the libertarians in groups like the Cato Institute, and there are all sorts of real conservatives who are for impeaching this guy.
[02:45:37.001 --> 02:45:43.265]  And there are hardcore neoconservative backers who sold us this war who've now turned against Bush.
[02:45:43.405 --> 02:45:45.486]  Well, America won't get its soul back.
[02:45:45.546 --> 02:45:49.808]  I mean, folks, we've gone from the most loved, the most hated in less than a decade.
[02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:53.150]  We're not going to get our soul back unless people are brought to justice.
[02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:58.213]  And by the way, I mean the defense contractors that wrote the policy, that made the campaign contributions.
[02:45:58.673 --> 02:45:59.873]  I mean the neocons.
[02:46:00.233 --> 02:46:02.434]  We need a bunch of these people to go to prison.
[02:46:02.694 --> 02:46:03.794]  And I think it's possible.
[02:46:04.114 --> 02:46:05.735]  That's why they're going to fight so hard, though.
[02:46:05.755 --> 02:46:07.455]  You know, David, you've studied these people.
[02:46:07.955 --> 02:46:13.696]  Why do you think Rumsfeld and John Yoo and Gonzalez put in memos they can torture children and stuff?
[02:46:14.016 --> 02:46:17.997]  I mean, didn't they know that that was just throwing down the gauntlet?
[02:46:18.017 --> 02:46:20.038]  That even the Nazis didn't put stuff on paper?
[02:46:20.878 --> 02:46:26.919]  That's right, and that's why they passed that Military Commissions Act not long before an election, knowing it would hurt them.
[02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:32.692]  Because they wanted to retroactively legalize their crimes, which is done in that act.
[02:46:32.732 --> 02:46:33.972]  They're scared.
[02:46:33.992 --> 02:46:39.653]  But I'm asking you, because you study them, you go up there, I mean, you're all over the place.
[02:46:40.454 --> 02:46:43.074]  What is wrong with them to openly say it?
[02:46:43.354 --> 02:46:47.816]  My point is, a smart criminal doesn't leave handbooks and ledgers around.
[02:46:48.276 --> 02:46:49.916]  I mean, we have smoking gun evidence.
[02:46:50.056 --> 02:46:52.437]  Why did they do something that Hitler didn't do?
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:58.161]  An absolutely unfathomable amount of arrogance.
[02:46:59.102 --> 02:47:04.883]  George Bush is, you know, he's an idiot, but primarily he's incredibly arrogant.
[02:47:05.384 --> 02:47:06.044]  I agree.
[02:47:06.204 --> 02:47:19.568]  This is a kid who, you know, went around blowing up frogs and turtles for fun, a mean little brat who's never had to civilize himself or be accountable to anything or apologize for anything in his entire life.
[02:47:20.028 --> 02:47:23.429]  You know, this is a frat boy
[02:47:23.959 --> 02:47:34.809]  Who's been bailed out time and again, and who thinks it's unmanly to change course or admit you were wrong about anything, and who's never had to come face-to-face with that.
[02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:36.110]  Well, now he will.
[02:47:37.592 --> 02:47:41.576]  I just can't believe they openly wrote memos saying they could crush children with pliers.
[02:47:41.656 --> 02:47:42.336]  I mean, come on.
[02:47:42.917 --> 02:47:44.879]  No one can defend that, but they still do!
[02:47:46.224 --> 02:47:56.852]  It's incredibly offensive to suggest that you can do anything short of killing someone and it's okay and it doesn't count as torture.
[02:47:57.533 --> 02:47:59.434]  Well, you know, then what's torture?
[02:47:59.975 --> 02:48:03.618]  And if Bush wanted to get
[02:48:04.771 --> 02:48:08.733]  You know, facts out of these people about Valerie Plame or anything.
[02:48:09.053 --> 02:48:10.073]  Why didn't he torture them?
[02:48:10.374 --> 02:48:11.674]  You know, because it doesn't even work.
[02:48:12.054 --> 02:48:13.095]  Alright, final segment.
[02:48:13.115 --> 02:48:17.557]  I want to ask you about how we help get Bush impeached, what the strategy is with these petitions.
[02:48:18.417 --> 02:48:20.458]  On the other side, we'll take two final calls too.
[02:48:21.358 --> 02:48:22.899]  Our guest is David Swanson.
[02:48:22.919 --> 02:48:23.699]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:23.739 --> 02:48:28.341]  Our websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and JonesReport.com.
[02:48:28.762 --> 02:48:30.783]  His website is davidswanson.com.
[02:48:31.143 --> 02:48:31.763]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:41.272 --> 02:48:41.732]  It's here!
[02:48:41.932 --> 02:48:46.694]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:47.094 --> 02:48:54.756]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:55.416 --> 02:49:02.479]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:02.879 --> 02:49:09.781]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House probe into disseminating fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:10.242 --> 02:49:14.264]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:14.604 --> 02:49:18.126]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:18.566 --> 02:49:20.487]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:20.827 --> 02:49:24.729]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:38.061 --> 02:49:38.802]  Terrorism!
[02:49:38.962 --> 02:49:39.702]  Terrorism!
[02:49:39.822 --> 02:49:45.887]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:49:46.147 --> 02:49:47.749]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:49:47.969 --> 02:49:50.451]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:49:50.851 --> 02:50:05.422]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:05.442 --> 02:50:05.762]  government.
[02:50:05.963 --> 02:50:07.724]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:50:08.124 --> 02:50:14.029]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:14.149 --> 02:50:18.673]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:51:33.665 --> 02:51:36.287]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:51:41.192 --> 02:51:41.692]  Don't worry.
[02:51:42.173 --> 02:51:43.693]  This show is documented.
[02:51:44.214 --> 02:51:47.495]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:48.876 --> 02:51:52.658]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:51:53.219 --> 02:51:58.181]  Love is a burning thing, and it makes a fiery ring.
[02:51:59.622 --> 02:52:00.543]  Thank you so much.
[02:52:00.783 --> 02:52:06.426]  Again, we're going to take a few calls here at the end, but I want to thank David Swanson for joining us.
[02:52:07.641 --> 02:52:13.426]  And I hope that the conscience of the Democratic Party, the American people, will take action and do something about this.
[02:52:15.109 --> 02:52:18.751]  But this is just too much that they wouldn't even give lip service.
[02:52:18.771 --> 02:52:19.851]  I think it was a mistake too.
[02:52:20.192 --> 02:52:29.436]  You know, Pelosi would have given lip service, this kind of might have dissipated a bit, but I think by her throwing down the gauntlet and saying no investigation, I think she's got a tiger by the tail now.
[02:52:29.476 --> 02:52:30.237]  What do you say, David?
[02:52:30.697 --> 02:52:32.118]  Well, she's saying no impeachment.
[02:52:32.158 --> 02:52:33.919]  She's not saying no investigations.
[02:52:34.179 --> 02:52:39.922]  That's where she doesn't make any sense, because investigations will get to impeachment, especially
[02:52:40.502 --> 02:52:41.423]  If we demand it.
[02:52:41.683 --> 02:52:43.184]  Unless they're designed to be whitewashers.
[02:52:43.265 --> 02:52:46.727]  How do we help you impeach Lord Bush?
[02:52:47.468 --> 02:52:50.591]  Come to our website afterdowningstreet.org.
[02:52:50.651 --> 02:52:52.592]  It's a nonpartisan coalition.
[02:52:52.712 --> 02:52:57.517]  Lots of people from across the political spectrum and sign up to stay informed.
[02:52:57.537 --> 02:52:59.899]  Help organize in your congressional district.
[02:53:00.299 --> 02:53:02.341]  Help plan events for December 10th.
[02:53:02.741 --> 02:53:04.663]  Help get signatures on petitions.
[02:53:04.743 --> 02:53:06.984]  Help raise hell with the media and
[02:53:08.470 --> 02:53:11.553]  Lowly but surely, we'll get there by spring.
[02:53:11.853 --> 02:53:13.134]  Well, I hope you're right.
[02:53:13.174 --> 02:53:14.295]  Let's be clear on this.
[02:53:14.355 --> 02:53:22.602]  If we weren't here fighting these criminals, if we weren't here saying no to the war, no to Lebanon, no to all of it, they would already be a lot further down the road in their agenda.
[02:53:23.122 --> 02:53:24.564]  And I think we're making history here.
[02:53:24.644 --> 02:53:30.048]  I mean, they may be able to buy off the Congress and control them, but it does show the people are taking action.
[02:53:30.488 --> 02:53:31.169]  Absolutely.
[02:53:31.449 --> 02:53:31.950]  I'm with you.
[02:53:32.250 --> 02:53:34.132]  Alright, David Swanson, thanks for checking in with us.
[02:53:34.332 --> 02:53:34.712]  Thank you.
[02:53:35.032 --> 02:53:35.333]  You bet.
[02:53:35.373 --> 02:53:35.733]  Take care.
[02:53:36.704 --> 02:53:39.206]  Before I take two final calls real quick, please support us.
[02:53:39.246 --> 02:53:44.170]  Please go to InfoWars.com and get America, Freedom to Fascism for $19.95 and get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[02:53:45.531 --> 02:53:50.675]  Half price when you get it if you choose or get America, Freedom to Fascism or Terror Storm by itself.
[02:53:51.075 --> 02:53:53.978]  A bunch of other great books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:54.478 --> 02:53:58.881]  We have the Christmas special five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:58.921 --> 02:54:02.184]  Go check that out or call toll free to order the books and videos 1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:06.912 --> 02:54:09.794]  Got a lot of different specials and stuff going right now.
[02:54:10.354 --> 02:54:13.877]  Again, at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:54:16.419 --> 02:54:19.781]  Going up later today, I've got a new t-shirt special for $12.95.
[02:54:19.841 --> 02:54:21.722]  A new 9-11 Inside Job t-shirt.
[02:54:22.583 --> 02:54:23.544]  $12.95 for the t-shirts.
[02:54:24.004 --> 02:54:25.285]  That's going to be going up today.
[02:54:25.325 --> 02:54:26.105]  It should be.
[02:54:26.186 --> 02:54:28.487]  It should have gone up Friday, but it hadn't yet.
[02:54:29.428 --> 02:54:32.630]  Let's go ahead and talk to Thomas.
[02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:33.751]  Thomas, where are you calling from?
[02:54:34.523 --> 02:54:35.904]  Um, the Show Me State, sir.
[02:54:36.144 --> 02:54:36.824]  How's it going?
[02:54:36.944 --> 02:54:37.705]  From Missouri.
[02:54:38.085 --> 02:54:38.865]  It's going pretty good.
[02:54:39.786 --> 02:54:56.413]  Um, I was wanting to point out to that, uh, worker who called in earlier and point out to him films such as Beyond Treason, which they talk about, uh, squalene and the vaccines and how our military has been experimented upon.
[02:54:56.493 --> 02:54:59.575]  But what I see is happening is quite incredible.
[02:55:00.270 --> 02:55:05.834]  We have all these COINTELPRO groups who are just falling apart and scattering to the wind.
[02:55:05.854 --> 02:55:07.254]  It's not working anymore.
[02:55:07.275 --> 02:55:08.295]  Well, the funding ended.
[02:55:08.575 --> 02:55:12.318]  And you can always see when people are COINTELPRO, we already knew some were.
[02:55:12.658 --> 02:55:15.039]  But then you see them falling apart when their funding ends.
[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:21.243]  And yeah, I've seen five or six known COINTELPRO group websites disbanding in the last week.
[02:55:22.844 --> 02:55:23.725]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:23.745 --> 02:55:27.227]  But it's kind of upsetting because they send us viewers.
[02:55:27.367 --> 02:55:29.609]  So, in a weird way, it actually hurts us.
[02:55:32.985 --> 02:55:33.966]  Call me back tomorrow, Thomas.
[02:55:33.986 --> 02:55:34.686]  I've got to go to Roman.
[02:55:34.967 --> 02:55:35.327]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:35.367 --> 02:55:36.267]  Call me back earlier tomorrow.
[02:55:36.548 --> 02:55:37.508]  Roman in California.
[02:55:37.528 --> 02:55:38.529]  You've got 45 seconds.
[02:55:39.189 --> 02:55:43.252]  Yeah, uh, I don't have a full investigation on the Freemasons.
[02:55:43.292 --> 02:55:47.895]  They basically control everything in the government, and we need to investigate them.
[02:55:48.335 --> 02:55:50.516]  You called Friday and said that, and I'll try to get on it.
[02:55:50.536 --> 02:55:51.337]  Yeah.
[02:55:51.937 --> 02:55:52.858]  I made a film about it.
[02:55:53.098 --> 02:55:54.419]  It's called The Order of Death, brother.
[02:55:55.709 --> 02:55:56.609]  The Order of Death.
[02:55:56.809 --> 02:55:57.790]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:57.910 --> 02:56:02.671]  Again, get The Order of Death and you get My Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove updated, remastered.
[02:56:03.572 --> 02:56:04.292]  Two films in 1995.
[02:56:04.672 --> 02:56:08.213]  I mean, we're making it so cheap we can barely fund ourselves here.
[02:56:08.613 --> 02:56:09.474]  Go get Order of Death.
[02:56:09.954 --> 02:56:10.954]  Combo DVD.
[02:56:11.474 --> 02:56:12.115]  Out of time?
[02:56:12.155 --> 02:56:13.775]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:14.095 --> 02:56:15.096]  God bless you all!
[02:56:17.957 --> 02:56:22.558]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
