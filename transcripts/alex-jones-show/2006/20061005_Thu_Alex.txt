[00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:06.159]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.920]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.701]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.162]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:12.842]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:17.145]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:21.747]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.095]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.376]  It is Thursday, the fifth day of October 2006.
[00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:33.357]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:39.560]  Representative Virgil Goode of the 5th District of Virginia will be joining us.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.305]  He's introduced legislation to block NAFTA and North American Union highways, the taxing mechanism of this global government system.
[00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:53.927]  Then, Steve Watson, it'll be his second time on the broadcast.
[00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:56.088]  He was in studio last year.
[00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.430]  Here in Texas, he'll be joining us from London.
[00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:15.274]  He's done an incredible analysis and really broken the news, thanks to tips from listeners, about how fake the latest Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, slash hijacker videotapes are, released last Friday.
[00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:20.875]  Now on the heels of his report, the Times of London is reporting that this stuff is fake.
[00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:22.970]  This stuff is staged.
[00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.131]  This stuff is appearing out of nowhere.
[00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.073]  So Steve Watson will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:29.873]  Huge report.
[00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:42.620]  And then Chris Floyd with his amazing editorial about the Constitution overturning legislation, the Bill of Rights destroying legislation that passed last Friday.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.864]  We're not going to be diverted or distracted by the pervert news with Congressman Foley.
[00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:56.575]  Though I will point out that Drudge is in overdrive right now.
[00:01:57.356 --> 00:02:07.240]  ABC News posted a bunch of text messages and emails to different pages, several of them 16, saying, I'm 16, I'm too young, I can't talk to you.
[00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:15.764]  Drudge has found some instant message that they posted from an 18-year-old, and they're trying to spin that and claim it's all 18-year-olds.
[00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:18.937]  There's just no end.
[00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:24.359]  This is the neocons are calling in to talk radio going, going, the Democrats are perverts too!
[00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.919]  Here's an example of Democrats, Barney Frank!
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.700]  As if that makes it okay!
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.820]  They're all bad!
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.880]  Exactly!
[00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:35.062]  Well, Bill Clinton was a traitor too!
[00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:38.142]  Bill Clinton wanted to get rid of our borders too!
[00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:39.683]  I mean, of course!
[00:02:39.723 --> 00:02:40.883]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:44.484]  So I do have some comments on that.
[00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:47.925]  Really scary article here out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:50.787]  FBI worries about Al-Qaeda ties to the mob.
[00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:58.772]  Oh yes, oh just you see Al-Qaeda is involved with with just normal criminals now and then and see all crime is Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.895]  And remember a few months ago the Houston police chief said he wants cameras in everybody's homes?
[00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:11.519]  Well they're back at it again and meanwhile up in Milwaukee they want to force cameras in all of the businesses and bars.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.481]  So again, forcing you to take cameras
[00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:21.207]  And hey, Google's announced they're going to use the microphones and cameras built in standard on most computers to watch you and listen to you in your home.
[00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:22.528]  Oh, what's the big deal?
[00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:27.572]  By the way, Google's been caught deleting our millions of viewers of TerrorStorm again.
[00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:29.514]  It's very frustrating.
[00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:31.376]  Makes me mad.
[00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:34.919]  They're not doing it to other great 9-11 films.
[00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.841]  They're doing it to us, and they've admitted they've done it.
[00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:38.762]  They say it's an accident.
[00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:43.119]  Because once we go into the top 100, the most popular, then it's exponential.
[00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.300]  That's what everybody who watches Google Video goes and looks at, is the top 100.
[00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:51.863]  Tens of millions a week peruse it, and we're being cheated in our fight against the New World Order.
[00:03:51.883 --> 00:04:05.830]  But hey, just because the enemy has thrown sand in our eyes, just because the enemy has pieces of iron sewn into their gloves, it's just we've got to get even madder, and gut up even stronger, and totally KO them!
[00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:08.872]  So I want you all to go to
[00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:10.395]  Google.
[00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.717]  Click video and type in Terror Storm.
[00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:15.399]  And pick one of the high quality links there.
[00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.302]  And I want you to go absolutely ape.
[00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:20.483]  And email it out to your entire email list.
[00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:21.764]  Post on every message board.
[00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:22.565]  Keep it up.
[00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:24.507]  We found out what they're doing.
[00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:27.929]  Every time it hits over 200,000 on the counters.
[00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.993]  And there's like over 20 versions of it up there.
[00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:33.874]  Every time it does that.
[00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:37.337]  Suddenly it deletes it.
[00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:44.591]  And then now, instead of taking a few weeks to get up to 200,000, in just a few days it gets to 200,000 and they delete it again.
[00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.734]  There's some little algorithm, some little trigger built in.
[00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:54.518]  But there have been, just on Google alone now, over 4 million views of TerrorStorm.
[00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.300]  But we're being cheated.
[00:04:58.641 --> 00:04:59.521]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.690]  It's here!
[00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.711]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:17.733]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.413 --> 00:05:25.454]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:32.736]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:37.270]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.092]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.552 --> 00:05:43.453]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:47.736]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:06.432]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.572 --> 00:06:14.661]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:21.968]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:29.390]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.671]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:43.674]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:47.214]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:49.576]  I think so.
[00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.710]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.492]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:09.613]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:13.315]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:19.439]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest greatest nutritional wonder products?
[00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:24.562]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:26.883]  But what if you found from a single source
[00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:27.423]  That's right.
[00:07:48.773 --> 00:07:51.797]  Or call me, Amy Bjorkman, personally at 805-595-2711.
[00:07:51.817 --> 00:07:51.857]  805-595-2711.
[00:07:51.877 --> 00:07:55.001]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.842]  Alright, second segment.
[00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:13.585]  First segment for some stations that are just now joining us.
[00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:15.427]  It is Thursday, 5th day of October 2006.
[00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:21.233]  Coming up in the next hour, Steve Watson, reporter from London, will be joining us.
[00:08:21.273 --> 00:08:22.134]  He broke the news.
[00:08:22.194 --> 00:08:31.024]  It's been confirmed that the supposed hijacker videos of last week have been released for two years and are staged.
[00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:32.463]  This is huge.
[00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:34.004]  The mainstream media has been ignoring it.
[00:08:34.144 --> 00:08:41.330]  Finally, after five days of this story being out, or four days, the Times of London has weighed in saying, yeah, it looks like it's staged.
[00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.772]  There's a lot of problems with it, so we'll be talking about that.
[00:08:45.272 --> 00:08:48.275]  And then, of course, syndicated columnist Chris Floyd joins us in the third hour.
[00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:55.877]  Right now, we're honored to be joined by someone who's strong on the Second Amendment, border security, national sovereignty.
[00:08:56.197 --> 00:09:10.282]  Here's the World Net Daily headline, North American Union Threat Gets Attention of Congressmen, Resolution Aimed at Blocking Merger, Funding of NAFTA Superhighways, because they're going to tax us with toll roads with these and then pay for roads in Mexico.
[00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:10.722]  That's in there.
[00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:17.305]  Now, this is the North American Union Taxation Grid, and roads are power.
[00:09:17.845 --> 00:09:22.690]  And so we are honored to be joined by the Congressman from the 5th District of the great state of Virginia.
[00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:34.203]  He's part of Congressman Ron Paul's Liberty Committee, and this is another one of the unsung heroes in Congress that the media likes to ignore, because I know quite a bit about Congress, and I knew a little bit about
[00:09:35.302 --> 00:09:39.104]  Representative Virgil Goode, but I didn't know that much about him.
[00:09:39.564 --> 00:09:41.365]  And so here he is for you, the audience.
[00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:42.826]  Thank you, sir, for spending time with us.
[00:09:43.846 --> 00:09:44.626]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:46.227]  It's an honor to be on your show.
[00:09:46.247 --> 00:09:47.588]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:58.393]  You're stepping up to the plate with Ron Paul and others, with your leadership, to fight the wildly unconstitutional and wildly unpopular NAFTA superhighways.
[00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:03.415]  First off, tell us about how you learned of it, what we're truly facing, and what you're doing to fight it, and how we can help you.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:24.398]  Well, first learned of it through some media statements and through conversations with persons who expressed a concern about, I believe they called it, the Partnership for Prosperity among Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
[00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:28.382]  And I saw that as a loss of our sovereignty.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.181]  I was not a supporter of NAFTA.
[00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:34.962]  In fact, I have a bill in to repeal NAFTA.
[00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:37.523]  We do not need a NAFTA superhighway.
[00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:45.626]  The trucks from Mexico, in my opinion, are not as safe as most United States trucks.
[00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:46.727]  Well, that's not your opinion.
[00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:49.708]  That's admitted, and the state police are told to leave them alone.
[00:10:50.088 --> 00:10:58.151]  We already have Mexican trucks driving in from Texas all the way to New York, and they're involved in a higher percentage of wrecks per capita.
[00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:08.040]  Well, I haven't seen that exact statistic, but I've talked with persons in law enforcement, just as you've indicated, and others, who say that is the case.
[00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:13.018]  And I'm not for them coming all the way into the interior.
[00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:21.421]  At one time, and you can know the exact mileage, they had like a 10 or 20 mile zone right near the border, and that's all they could go.
[00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:25.943]  It was 10, then 20, then 50, and then nationwide, yeah.
[00:11:26.003 --> 00:11:26.563]  Yes.
[00:11:27.523 --> 00:11:34.246]  The safety of the traveling public is diminished by having all the Mexican trucks in this country,
[00:11:35.307 --> 00:11:41.677]  The highway would simply diminish further the safety of our traveling public.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.062]  Well, Congressman, in Texas we barely defeated, but they're still going ahead with it.
[00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.162]  They don't care, they don't have a law.
[00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:58.586]  Transponders and all the inspection stickers, they openly say, and they call it the Texas Corridor, the Texas grouping, but in Florida it's the same name.
[00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:08.390]  They're telling locals that pieces of the highway are local to deceive people, but really it is part of the larger national, international system.
[00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.571]  And they're saying that they're going to Texas
[00:12:11.011 --> 00:12:13.173]  Oh, I'm totally opposed to paying for any road in Mexico.
[00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:15.755]  We need the funds that are from the traditional sources like the gasoline tax
[00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:43.132]  The paper highways in this country for use by United States citizens.
[00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:50.199]  And I'm vigorously opposed this union among Canada, the United States and Mexico.
[00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:53.623]  It's a further derogation of our sovereignty.
[00:12:54.123 --> 00:12:59.669]  And we are going to lose rights if we go down this road.
[00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.051]  And it's part of the
[00:13:01.826 --> 00:13:16.436]  Globalized worldview of some, and I regret that President Bush felt compelled to deal with, I believe it was Mr. Howard at the time, and then Senator Fox on this issue.
[00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:27.604]  We need to be protecting our borders, securing our country, and not engaging in this triumvirate which would only be expanding.
[00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:30.466]  It's like NAFTA has expanded into CAFTA.
[00:13:31.096 --> 00:13:35.426]  And more free trade agreements around the world which brings in
[00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:40.325]  They're not negotiated fairly for us, in my opinion.
[00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.646]  Well, you're right, Congressman.
[00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:46.847]  We're again talking to the Congressman from the 5th District of Virginia, Virgil Goode, Jr.
[00:13:47.488 --> 00:13:59.872]  Congressman, three weeks ago there was a secret meeting with the tops of the Mexican, U.S., and Canadian government, and there were also the heads of most major Fortune 500 companies.
[00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:01.973]  Some of the minutes did get leaked out.
[00:14:02.673 --> 00:14:12.616]  It was openly setting up and expanding the North American Union, which Bush signed on to last year, with Paul Martin and Vicente Fox, then leaders of Canada and Mexico.
[00:14:13.376 --> 00:14:24.778]  I mean, I can't believe we're actually here on the air talking about North American Union, but not just North American Union, we're talking about secret governmental meetings now, and our government's saying it's secret.
[00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:26.959]  What's your view on that, Congressman?
[00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:31.100]  Well, I don't know the names of the companies that were in there with them, but it
[00:14:32.087 --> 00:14:38.210]  Some of these major companies are more interested in their margins than they are in the future of the country.
[00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:45.154]  And the owners and the large shareholders of these companies need to wake up.
[00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:56.780]  If they globalize the United States and take away our constitutional rights like the Second Amendment and others, who's going to stand up for freedom and capitalism in the world?
[00:14:57.593 --> 00:15:00.194]  If we don't stand up for it, it's not going to happen.
[00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:10.779]  And all of those large shareholders with billions of dollars may think they can go to an island somewhere in the United States, but all they'll have is a sheet of paper.
[00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:21.683]  We need to stand fast for the sovereignty of this country, for preserving our borders, protecting this nation, which has been the champion for capitalism,
[00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:22.703]  We're good to go.
[00:15:39.727 --> 00:15:40.768]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:15:40.808 --> 00:15:50.096]  The problem is you've got global corporations that have colluded together who aren't operating like capitalistic interests, but they're operating like crime syndicates.
[00:15:50.457 --> 00:15:55.862]  They're in there wanting the Supreme Court ruling where they can start grabbing private property for private interest.
[00:15:56.182 --> 00:16:00.306]  This is more of a robber baron type strip mining
[00:16:00.906 --> 00:16:01.746]  Of the society.
[00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:04.067]  You know, the feds say we've got 14 million illegals.
[00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:08.587]  The real numbers from groups that have done the studies is over 30 million illegal aliens.
[00:16:08.607 --> 00:16:10.088]  They're illegal aliens.
[00:16:10.148 --> 00:16:11.128]  They want them in here.
[00:16:11.468 --> 00:16:13.588]  Some of the large companies do.
[00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:15.789]  I don't want to say all of them do, but some of them do.
[00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:19.429]  Because cheap labor reduces labor costs.
[00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.530]  But it's undermining the integrity of the United States.
[00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.211]  And we need, for our president,
[00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:45.094]  for a majority in Congress to say no amnesty for illegals and uh... if we said no amnesty and took a farmstern stand against amnesty uh... many of them would go back to their home countries and I am glad a partial fence bill passed.
[00:16:45.214 --> 00:16:56.476]  I wish the poll fence bill would have passed but we are making a step and many thought six months ago that that had no chance at all but the general public
[00:16:57.222 --> 00:17:09.249]  Alex is becoming aware of the situation and the heat got turned up enough that the Senate and some of the Democrats had to cave in and vote for the fence.
[00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:17.554]  Absolutely, but as you said, it's a 2,000 plus mile border, a 700 mile fence with giant gutters under it where people can go right up underneath it.
[00:17:17.594 --> 00:17:23.017]  I mean, is this fence going to be more modern than the ones with the giant gutters where you can just walk right underneath it?
[00:17:23.117 --> 00:17:25.459]  Oh yeah, the fence will be
[00:17:26.468 --> 00:17:41.531]  That I envision is like the one between Mexico and San Diego, where it's not a fence, it is a series of fences with roads in between, so it's not just a fence put up.
[00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:45.092]  Well, that's my final question for you, Congressman.
[00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:48.253]  We have six and a half billion people that want into this country.
[00:17:48.273 --> 00:17:51.714]  There's a hundred plus million new births every 16 to 18 months.
[00:17:53.392 --> 00:17:57.754]  To all the people that think we have to have open borders, folks, everyone wants to come here.
[00:17:57.774 --> 00:18:02.356]  We're already basically bankrupt from the medical costs, the welfare costs.
[00:18:02.376 --> 00:18:06.277]  We're probably already pretty much done for as an economy.
[00:18:07.438 --> 00:18:08.959]  Our legs are basically chopped off.
[00:18:08.999 --> 00:18:09.999]  We're bleeding to death here.
[00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:12.120]  We've got to put tourniquets on them now.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.101]  How do we get your legislation passed?
[00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:18.122]  Tell us about how we get a tourniquet on it, how we pass H.R.
[00:18:18.142 --> 00:18:18.763]  487, Congressman.
[00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:23.867]  Four co-sponsors.
[00:18:23.987 --> 00:18:30.671]  Well, it's myself, Congressman Paul, Tom Tancredo of Colorado, and Walter Jones from North Carolina.
[00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:32.151]  They should all be signing it!
[00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:33.372]  Every person in Congress!
[00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:33.892]  Absolutely!
[00:18:34.373 --> 00:18:41.817]  And it's important for the public to get accepted and generated on this issue, and contact their representatives.
[00:18:42.757 --> 00:18:49.541]  We got the bill back from Legislative Services right before the campaign recess break.
[00:18:50.274 --> 00:19:02.719]  And when we go back, the more that can sign that and send a message to the administration and to others that want some globalized, leveling down world would be great.
[00:19:03.639 --> 00:19:05.680]  Absolutely.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.302]  These roads really are the beachhead for a new world order, aren't they, Congressman?
[00:19:09.742 --> 00:19:09.982]  Yes.
[00:19:11.065 --> 00:19:12.646]  Uh, this is a litmus test.
[00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:18.269]  I mean, we have 90 plus percent of Americans in major polls against these NAFTA highways, these nation-killing roads.
[00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:28.834]  We need to, when the new, uh, when the recess ends and the Congress comes back into session, should everybody be demanding in person at meetings while the congressmen and women are at recess?
[00:19:28.874 --> 00:19:33.276]  And should they be demanding on the telephone when they get back in that they co-sponsor this now?
[00:19:33.996 --> 00:19:37.298]  I think that would be a tremendous help to the legislation.
[00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:46.121]  If as many people get energized about the fence as this, we have a chance to tie them.
[00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:47.462]  Absolutely, folks.
[00:19:47.502 --> 00:19:49.463]  You know what you need to do now to fight this.
[00:19:49.763 --> 00:19:51.344]  Congressman, I hope to get you back up soon.
[00:19:51.384 --> 00:19:52.004]  God bless you.
[00:19:52.044 --> 00:19:52.424]  Thank you.
[00:19:53.004 --> 00:19:53.705]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:54.365]  Take care.
[00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:58.087]  There goes Representative Virgil Goode, 5th District, Virginia.
[00:19:58.127 --> 00:19:58.587]  Stay with us.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.561]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:10.481]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:19.684]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:20.644 --> 00:20:25.505]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:36.173]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.975]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:39.756 --> 00:20:40.997]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:41.017 --> 00:20:41.057]  702-953-0267.
[00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:07.335]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:13.160]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.721]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:18.744]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:32.749]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:33.229 --> 00:21:38.552]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:38.852 --> 00:21:44.734]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:46.835]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:51.501]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:51.942 --> 00:21:52.543]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:54.745]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:54.765 --> 00:21:54.826]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:03.951]  Terrorism!
[00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:04.852]  Terrorism!
[00:22:04.952 --> 00:22:11.014]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:22:11.275 --> 00:22:12.855]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:15.576]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:22:15.977 --> 00:22:30.543]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:30.883]  government.
[00:22:31.063 --> 00:22:32.864]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:22:33.244 --> 00:22:39.168]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:43.811]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:22:44.052 --> 00:22:49.455]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.555 --> 00:22:50.756]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:51.357]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.417 --> 00:22:53.458]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:23:03.283 --> 00:23:05.764]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.246]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:23:08.306 --> 00:23:15.390]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.272]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:22.474]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:23:23.014 --> 00:23:27.157]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:23:27.737 --> 00:23:30.679]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:34.583]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:23:35.344 --> 00:23:37.786]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:37.826 --> 00:23:38.066]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:39.767]  For the following two free reports.
[00:23:39.827 --> 00:23:40.007]  U.S.
[00:23:40.047 --> 00:23:42.829]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:23:42.849 --> 00:23:43.210]  Call 888-Xanadu.
[00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.070]  That's 888-Xanadu.
[00:23:57.566 --> 00:24:00.969]  X-A-M-A-D-U, and ask for Jor.
[00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:02.330]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:02.870]  Welcome back.
[00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.572]  Alright, I literally have about a four-inch stack here.
[00:24:05.592 --> 00:24:07.393]  Actually, I have two stacks here of news.
[00:24:07.494 --> 00:24:10.496]  And I could spend the next three hours on this one alone.
[00:24:29.336 --> 00:24:37.740]  I get around 500 good emails a day, not just spam or news links, but actual emails, and it's always filled with things like this.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.460]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.223]  I was aware of programs like this, but I tend to forget about it.
[00:24:43.263 --> 00:24:56.669]  Just like I've kind of forgotten about three weeks ago, Google announced they're going to use the microphones and video cameras built into many standard PCs now to openly watch you and listen to you and categorize what you say and do with AI software.
[00:24:57.759 --> 00:24:59.199]  Huge, earth-shaking event.
[00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:01.620]  It just goes and passes, no big deal.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.101]  What, a few months ago, the police chief of Houston said, we want to make people put cameras in their homes.
[00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:17.222]  Today, Milwaukee says they want to make businesses, restaurants, bars, all take cameras, which they, of course, will tap into.
[00:25:17.962 --> 00:25:19.023]  Same thing's happening in England.
[00:25:19.063 --> 00:25:20.203]  Same thing's happening in Illinois.
[00:25:21.503 --> 00:25:25.664]  They passed a new freedom initiative to start forced psychological testing for everyone ages 4 to 18.
[00:25:25.704 --> 00:25:25.964]  It's begun.
[00:25:28.223 --> 00:25:29.484]  It's all happening.
[00:25:29.504 --> 00:25:31.085]  They're just marching forward.
[00:25:33.928 --> 00:25:37.310]  And we cover the articles and we just move on to the next tragedy.
[00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:40.113]  The next travesty of freedom and liberty.
[00:25:40.393 --> 00:25:44.336]  We are in an incredibly abusive, sickening system.
[00:25:44.436 --> 00:25:47.018]  But the average person, again, is not conscious of it.
[00:25:47.258 --> 00:25:51.962]  And then when you get snared by it, you don't even recognize the tyranny for what it is.
[00:25:52.002 --> 00:25:53.504]  You don't know how to fight back against it.
[00:25:53.544 --> 00:25:55.625]  You don't know your constitutional rights.
[00:25:55.645 --> 00:25:56.506]  You don't know history.
[00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:57.687]  I'm talking about the average person.
[00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:04.419]  But I remember about five years ago, we started hearing, the schools are falling apart.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.744]  Let's get tough on parents that don't make their children finish their homework.
[00:26:10.284 --> 00:26:12.026]  Let's arrest them.
[00:26:14.107 --> 00:26:21.013]  And by the way, that started in Virginia, that started in D.C., that started in Houston, Texas, of all places.
[00:26:21.854 --> 00:26:25.437]  And of course, you notice since the government federalized the schools and took them over 50 years ago,
[00:26:26.095 --> 00:26:31.097]  We've gone from the smartest in the world, the highest test scores, to the lowest in the industrialized world.
[00:26:31.137 --> 00:26:34.978]  And last time I checked, thirty-something plus behind third world countries.
[00:26:35.498 --> 00:26:36.499]  We're fifty of something.
[00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:39.800]  Since, uh, I keep saying fifty years.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.001]  Since 1953, so that'd be fifty-three years.
[00:26:44.982 --> 00:26:48.643]  We were number one in the fifties, in the early fifties and late forties.
[00:26:48.803 --> 00:26:49.683]  Number one.
[00:26:50.244 --> 00:26:54.285]  All the inventions, all the profits, all the money, all the ideas.
[00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:56.630]  I mean, Americans walked tall.
[00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.431]  They were smart.
[00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:58.272]  They dressed sharp.
[00:26:58.312 --> 00:26:59.332]  They knew what was going on.
[00:26:59.673 --> 00:27:00.593]  They were informed.
[00:27:00.713 --> 00:27:01.874]  And then they got decadent.
[00:27:02.455 --> 00:27:05.117]  And here we are today, and you're saying, well, Alex, what are you going to get to next?
[00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.638]  This tears my guts out.
[00:27:07.678 --> 00:27:11.001]  I mean, this is Shawshank Redemption.
[00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:12.502]  This is corruption.
[00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:14.303]  The bureaucracy is hungry.
[00:27:14.844 --> 00:27:16.485]  They want more people, and they're going to get them.
[00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:21.669]  I called the school this morning in Tell City, Indiana.
[00:27:23.721 --> 00:27:25.323]  I called the City Junior High School.
[00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:26.223]  I had the form.
[00:27:26.283 --> 00:27:27.004]  I had the email.
[00:27:27.124 --> 00:27:28.185]  But I wanted to confirm it.
[00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.387]  And I asked, do they indeed do this?
[00:27:30.467 --> 00:27:33.169]  And the secretary, or whoever it was, answered the phone.
[00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.430]  I didn't have much time.
[00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.391]  I was running out of the office.
[00:27:35.411 --> 00:27:36.172]  I said, yeah, we do that.
[00:27:37.553 --> 00:27:42.997]  And it says, right here in the letter, the parent makes the claim in the email, but then it says it in their little form letter.
[00:27:43.718 --> 00:27:49.663]  If the teacher says you haven't properly finished your email, there's no judge, no jury, no proceeding.
[00:27:49.683 --> 00:27:50.524]  It's all color of law.
[00:27:50.564 --> 00:27:51.865]  It's all totally criminal.
[00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:53.639]  Totally criminal!
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.421]  They then say, you've got to go to Friday school.
[00:27:58.062 --> 00:28:19.197]  And when you go to Friday school, it's at Friday night, if your parents don't pick you up exactly on time, you go into police custody, it says right here, you go to the police station, and it says that Child Protective Services, they call it, we find their name important in the end, it's CPS in Florida and Texas and most states, there they call it
[00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:22.269]  We've got another name for it.
[00:28:22.289 --> 00:28:23.149]  It's here in this form.
[00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.011]  Where's the part?
[00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:27.111]  Should be necessary.
[00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:31.094]  Involve the Perry County Office of Family and Children.
[00:28:31.134 --> 00:28:35.016]  So it's uh... it's uh... County Office of Family and Children there.
[00:28:35.196 --> 00:28:36.497]  So it's the Office of Family and Children.
[00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:39.899]  And CPS drops by and interrogates them.
[00:28:40.299 --> 00:28:43.381]  So it's an illegal detainment at the police station.
[00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:46.523]  It's an illegal interrogation by CPS.
[00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:51.267]  And I've told you, I know lots of middle class, nice families.
[00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:54.348]  Imagine how bad it is for poor people who don't know their rights.
[00:28:55.908 --> 00:28:57.329]  The system really feeds on them.
[00:28:58.589 --> 00:29:14.714]  But I know middle class people, I mean folks living in $400,000 houses, you know, two nice cars, mommy makes $150,000 a year, daddy makes $200,000 a year, where the child in front of dozens of witnesses jumps off the merry-go-round and breaks their toe,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.621]  And when you go to the hospital, CPS says, OK, parents stay in there, I'm going to talk to your child.
[00:29:19.881 --> 00:29:20.541]  Do they touch you?
[00:29:20.561 --> 00:29:21.361]  What do they do to you?
[00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:22.461]  Did they break your toe?
[00:29:24.302 --> 00:29:33.103]  Then I talked to another parent whose child jumped off of the jungle gym in front of witnesses, it didn't matter, and broke their hand.
[00:29:34.483 --> 00:29:37.924]  CPS tried to take the child, because they've run out of poor kids now.
[00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:41.084]  The hell is upon us!
[00:29:41.284 --> 00:29:44.325]  But here it is, totally illegal, total color of law,
[00:29:45.914 --> 00:29:48.357]  And, uh, well, we'll talk about it when we get back.
[00:29:48.597 --> 00:29:49.378]  They're all criminals.
[00:29:51.901 --> 00:29:52.802]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.302 --> 00:29:54.904]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:58.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.997 --> 00:30:06.638]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:30:06.678 --> 00:30:07.419]  have diabetes.
[00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:14.681]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.841 --> 00:30:19.362]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.562 --> 00:30:22.383]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:31:10.053 --> 00:31:10.653]  Yeah.
[00:31:11.034 --> 00:31:12.455]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:31:12.815 --> 00:31:16.217]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:31:16.698 --> 00:31:18.179]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:31:18.619 --> 00:31:20.360]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:31:20.721 --> 00:31:22.502]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:23.543]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:31:23.963 --> 00:31:26.225]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:31:26.466 --> 00:31:26.806]  What?

[00:33:08.527 --> 00:33:15.864]  The entire nation, the entire world is being set up as a grid to get you into slavery.
[00:33:16.485 --> 00:33:17.588]  But they have to do little games.
[00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:26.791]  They know that if they just come grab you and say, get in the back of the ox cart, we're going to put a chain around your neck, you're being taken to a plantation, you're my slave, you'll fight.
[00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:28.111]  No, no, no, no.
[00:33:28.391 --> 00:33:30.571]  They preface it with, it's for the children.
[00:33:30.611 --> 00:33:32.832]  You violated the regulation.
[00:33:33.172 --> 00:33:34.932]  We're doing this for education.
[00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:36.433]  We're doing this to keep you safe.
[00:33:37.013 --> 00:33:38.573]  Oh, you broke a law.
[00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:48.515]  Oh, we caught you with some drugs that they shipped in to begin with, so then when they catch you with their drugs, they put you in their camp
[00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:55.452]  working in a slave factory for twenty cents an hour displacing the rest of the population.
[00:33:55.792 --> 00:34:02.374]  You see, they have these little games to trick you like, oh it's my fault I'm here!
[00:34:03.275 --> 00:34:05.435]  Oh it's my fault I'm in this system!
[00:34:07.276 --> 00:34:12.658]  Meanwhile the criminals running the system are immune from the laws that they pass.
[00:34:13.338 --> 00:34:15.359]  So let me go ahead and get into this now.
[00:34:15.859 --> 00:34:16.239]  This is
[00:34:17.262 --> 00:34:25.627]  Tell City Junior High, 3515 Mozari Street, Tell City, Indiana, 47586
[00:34:28.946 --> 00:34:36.212]  And you can call the school at 812-547-3748 or fax them at 812-547-9737.
[00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:43.438]  And again, you've got all these do-gooders, all these little idiots that mean well.
[00:34:44.018 --> 00:34:45.740]  They're very self-righteous about it.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.002]  Of course CPS comes if you don't...
[00:34:48.542 --> 00:34:50.363]  Pick your child up exactly on time.
[00:34:50.404 --> 00:34:52.225]  Of course we put them in police custody.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:54.286]  Of course CPS interrogates them.
[00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:55.287]  We've got to find out.
[00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:57.068]  Well, how about we come interrogate you?
[00:34:57.228 --> 00:34:58.449]  Well, no, I have rights.
[00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.131]  We interrogate the parents.
[00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:01.832]  We interrogate the children.
[00:35:01.992 --> 00:35:02.873]  We take them.
[00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:04.254]  It's good.
[00:35:04.514 --> 00:35:07.436]  Well, CPS is five times more likely to abuse or kill children.
[00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:10.238]  I never saw that, and I'm not going to look at those numbers.
[00:35:12.662 --> 00:35:21.808]  I mean, how many months have I been telling you that police, CPS workers, truancy workers, people in government, principals, are more apt to be engaged in every type of crime you can imagine?
[00:35:22.068 --> 00:35:27.511]  Because criminals like to be in positions of power, evidenced by what you're now seeing in Congress.
[00:35:29.693 --> 00:35:31.674]  Kell City Junior High School.
[00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:37.756]  And this isn't a judge, it's not a jury, it's not a law, it's not anything.
[00:35:37.856 --> 00:35:42.379]  It's just the school says and then you comply.
[00:35:42.419 --> 00:35:44.219]  It's all color of law.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:53.584]  Dear parent and or guardian, we are writing to inform you that your child has been assigned Friday school as a result of missed homework assignments.
[00:35:53.604 --> 00:35:56.105]  Now in some areas they just arrest you outright.
[00:35:56.385 --> 00:35:57.806]  And it is quote law.
[00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:00.501]  But I'll tell you how that trick's played in Texas.
[00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:05.746]  The purpose of Friday School is to give students the opportunity to catch up with their classmates.
[00:36:05.806 --> 00:36:09.289]  Each student will be instructed to complete the work they have missed.
[00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:12.872]  See, it's all these words about... Listen to the words carefully.
[00:36:13.312 --> 00:36:18.777]  We are writing to inform you that your child has been assigned Friday School as a result of missed homework assignments.
[00:36:19.038 --> 00:36:23.762]  The purpose of Friday School is to give students the opportunity to catch up with their classmates.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.721]  To give them the opportunity.
[00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:30.422]  See, it's no law, it's no regulation, it's not even... we just say.
[00:36:30.882 --> 00:36:39.406]  Each student will be instructed to complete the work they have missed, to work on homework that is due, and to review material that is relevant to their classes.
[00:36:41.507 --> 00:36:43.427]  And see, it'll be more next time.
[00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:49.209]  Friday school is supervised by two teachers and lasts from 3.15 to 6.15.
[00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.211]  Please make arrangements to pick up your child before 6.30.
[00:36:54.453 --> 00:36:55.594]  This is in bold.
[00:36:55.955 --> 00:37:03.041]  Should your child not be picked up, arrangements have been made with the Tell City Police Department to have them housed at the police station.
[00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:14.511]  We have also been informed that should it be necessary for the Tell City Police to intervene, it is their intention to also involve the Perry County Office of Family and Children.
[00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:17.013]  You see, if the police have to intervene,
[00:37:19.214 --> 00:37:32.401]  I've got the report now that when Dick Cheney ordered that high-level, middle-class, high-powered, non-profit consultant in Colorado, he walks by and says, the war is reprehensible.
[00:37:33.222 --> 00:37:40.125]  And then they walk back about ten minutes back by the same place and the Secret Service is waiting there and says, oh, your words were an assault.
[00:37:40.386 --> 00:37:42.767]  We're going to arrest you and your kids going to CPS.
[00:37:42.907 --> 00:37:46.669]  In fact, I was watching on cable last weekend
[00:37:48.394 --> 00:38:04.879]  One, they meet the F'ers and two, they meet the family and Robert De Niro just barely questions a state police officer and so they zap him and CPS takes the kid.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.781]  You see, and by the way, every time they do this, they interrogate him.
[00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:13.882]  Imagine driving in the car and usually you don't get your kid for about 24 hours.
[00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.043]  Does mommy ever touch you?
[00:38:16.986 --> 00:38:21.072]  Well, what three-year-old wasn't touched when they were being wiped, when they were being cleaned?
[00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:22.294]  Boom!
[00:38:22.995 --> 00:38:24.657]  Yeah, mommy, mommy touches me.
[00:38:24.858 --> 00:38:25.799]  Boom, baby!
[00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:31.868]  Your kid is probably gone forever and is going to be held, in most cases, by CPS rape gangs.
[00:38:32.876 --> 00:38:37.037]  They are, a large percentage of them, hardcore pedophiles.
[00:38:37.497 --> 00:38:48.900]  Hardcore pedophiles get your children when you go to jail for warrants or whatever, and the perverts go, does mommy, does daddy ever touch you?
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.841]  And the three-year-olds, well, yeah, they remember, you know, years before getting their diapers changed.
[00:38:53.842 --> 00:38:57.503]  And then now when you come in, there's a judge's order there.
[00:38:57.603 --> 00:38:59.003]  Oh, we've got to have hearings now.
[00:38:59.043 --> 00:39:00.363]  You're not going to be getting your child back.
[00:39:00.684 --> 00:39:02.084]  And then there's more intensive
[00:39:03.177 --> 00:39:12.261]  And then by the time your child then goes and gets the medical test, or now they have a medical exam if they've been molested, and most of the time, CPS has already raped the living daylights out of them.
[00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:14.662]  Oh, you didn't know that's how it works?
[00:39:15.102 --> 00:39:16.422]  Oh, absolutely!
[00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:20.944]  They rape your child, and then you go to prison for it!
[00:39:21.904 --> 00:39:23.205]  Man, these are six!
[00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:24.525]  Oh, God, help us!
[00:39:24.565 --> 00:39:25.846]  What have we turned into?
[00:39:25.866 --> 00:39:28.347]  Ah, I can't handle it!
[00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:31.381]  Oh, these criminals are everywhere!
[00:39:31.421 --> 00:39:34.384]  And again, they lie, color of law, say it's the law, you gotta be vaccinated.
[00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:38.508]  They lie, color of law, how do they take your kids in Houston if you haven't, quote, done the homework?
[00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:47.918]  They suspend your child, and as the suspension notice is issued, it's considered being truant now, under that city ordinance they have.
[00:39:47.938 --> 00:39:50.261]  I went and read it two, three years ago, and I passed it.
[00:39:51.787 --> 00:39:55.449]  And of course, state law says 14 unexcused absences.
[00:39:55.469 --> 00:39:56.089]  They may have changed.
[00:39:56.109 --> 00:40:03.552]  The last time I read the state truancy law was years ago when we were fighting the ASAP program here in town.
[00:40:04.052 --> 00:40:08.594]  Where again, your child is late to class three times in Austin.
[00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:11.035]  But we got that program scaled back.
[00:40:11.335 --> 00:40:12.375]  May have been beefed back up again.
[00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:13.756]  I haven't been fighting local issues lately.
[00:40:15.209 --> 00:40:23.972]  That constables come with CPS to your house unannounced and force their way in and literally, dog hair, dirty plates, boom, your kids are gone again.
[00:40:24.353 --> 00:40:30.675]  Anybody who lives in Austin who watches cable and the news knows we fought that for a year and finally got it suspended because it was illegal.
[00:40:30.735 --> 00:40:35.717]  We went in, started to file suit, read the actual law and we said, how is three late?
[00:40:35.837 --> 00:40:37.558]  I mean, you're late to class three times.
[00:40:37.858 --> 00:40:40.659]  And they started in the 6th and 7th grade where they start the periods.
[00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:47.302]  And little kids aren't used to running across the school in five minutes and getting their classes, so a lot of them are late.
[00:40:47.382 --> 00:40:54.546]  Again, it's designed to get normal, good children in the clutches of the criminal government.
[00:40:56.007 --> 00:41:08.233]  And again, a large percentage of those people involved in children's custody systems, the CPS, the investigators, the truancy officers,
[00:41:09.085 --> 00:41:16.569]  Just type truancy officer caught raping child, or truancy officer in sex scandal, or truancy officer... I mean, it's just thousands of links.
[00:41:16.649 --> 00:41:18.230]  Just... I mean, everywhere.
[00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.971]  That's just... feeding everywhere.
[00:41:20.472 --> 00:41:23.253]  And if you're a truancy officer, then you're not one.
[00:41:23.273 --> 00:41:27.896]  And I don't know what percentage of them are, but it's just... it's an astronomically higher than the general public.
[00:41:27.916 --> 00:41:28.576]  That's admitted.
[00:41:29.257 --> 00:41:34.580]  I'm sorry, you picked a profession, and maybe you didn't know, that is the profession of pedophiles.
[00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:36.721]  Okay?
[00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:38.182]  You didn't know that.
[00:41:40.154 --> 00:41:41.914]  You weren't aware of that.
[00:41:46.235 --> 00:41:47.575]  You weren't conscious of that.
[00:41:47.635 --> 00:41:48.656]  So, get in the profession.
[00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:53.256]  I'm sorry, you're in a profession known for dirtbags.
[00:41:55.117 --> 00:41:59.598]  And dirtbag isn't a strong enough term.
[00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:07.499]  And you know what, folks, again, we should all be enraged, in a white hot rage over this.
[00:42:09.071 --> 00:42:17.516]  Should your child be absent from school on Friday, he or her absence must be excused by a doctor and your child will be scheduled for the following Friday school holidays.
[00:42:18.096 --> 00:42:20.818]  Should the absence be unexcused, your child will be suspended from school.
[00:42:21.954 --> 00:42:22.294]  Boom!
[00:42:22.354 --> 00:42:26.636]  See, and I guarantee you, in Indiana, the law is multiple unexcused truancies.
[00:42:27.097 --> 00:42:27.757]  Doesn't matter now.
[00:42:28.137 --> 00:42:30.919]  They just decide to say it's one, you see.
[00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:44.246]  Because the feds write up these programs, and the National Association of Counties, and city managers, and governors, they all go get the same talking points, the same legislation, the same... All over the country, three inch grass gets your house seized.
[00:42:44.666 --> 00:42:46.607]  They selectively enforce it.
[00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:48.628]  The $2,000 a day fines in Austin, Texas.
[00:42:50.385 --> 00:42:52.746]  I've been to, for some reason they go after old people.
[00:42:52.786 --> 00:42:54.687]  They seem to know when you have a heart attack or cancer.
[00:42:55.067 --> 00:42:58.768]  Because if you're 35 years old and you've got three inch grass, they're not going to come after you.
[00:42:58.788 --> 00:43:07.231]  It's always some 85 year old World War II vet who's got some type of, I remember with Roland Ellingson, World War II vet.
[00:43:08.011 --> 00:43:09.792]  Beautiful over there on 37th Street.
[00:43:09.812 --> 00:43:10.212]  Beautiful.
[00:43:10.232 --> 00:43:11.052]  He had two houses.
[00:43:11.693 --> 00:43:13.393]  He built after Korea.
[00:43:13.433 --> 00:43:14.554]  He was a Korean vet, excuse me.
[00:43:14.934 --> 00:43:17.855]  He was an arborist and he had colon cancer.
[00:43:18.695 --> 00:43:20.937]  As soon as he got out of the hospital, man, cops were there.
[00:43:21.897 --> 00:43:23.699]  We went out to his house the day after it happened.
[00:43:24.259 --> 00:43:25.080]  They had arrested him.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.221]  And they said for the three-inch grass.
[00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:28.322]  And it was three-inch grass.
[00:43:29.203 --> 00:43:31.484]  No garbage, no junk, no nothing.
[00:43:31.544 --> 00:43:32.845]  Two nice, well-kept homes.
[00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:33.766]  He had renters in the front.
[00:43:34.046 --> 00:43:35.827]  He lived in the two-story house in the back.
[00:43:36.488 --> 00:43:40.631]  And, I mean, those two houses back then, what was it, valued at like half a mil?
[00:43:41.411 --> 00:43:43.833]  Over off 37th Street, which is downtown now.
[00:43:46.015 --> 00:43:48.936]  And all these Mercedes men zoning yuppies all around him.
[00:43:50.577 --> 00:43:54.619]  And then of course we found out it was a connected realtor that had been filing the complaints because they wanted the property.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.041]  I mean these people are like carrion crows.
[00:43:58.382 --> 00:43:59.462]  And he complained.
[00:43:59.482 --> 00:44:00.283]  He went on the TV show.
[00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:01.203]  We went and videotaped it.
[00:44:01.223 --> 00:44:01.744]  We showed it.
[00:44:01.784 --> 00:44:05.446]  We went down and showed the city health department with like two foot grass.
[00:44:06.106 --> 00:44:07.667]  The very people filing this on him.
[00:44:08.436 --> 00:44:11.017]  And the cops came to his house again, walked up to his door.
[00:44:11.097 --> 00:44:15.439]  Roland had drunk earlier in his life, but he couldn't drink then with the colon cancer.
[00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:16.639]  He could hardly walk.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.300]  We'd take him to the doctor and stuff.
[00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:19.901]  They knocked on the door.
[00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:20.721]  He came outside.
[00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:21.782]  He said, listen, I'm really sick.
[00:44:21.802 --> 00:44:22.762]  And they said, you're going with us.
[00:44:22.862 --> 00:44:23.542]  You've been drinking.
[00:44:23.562 --> 00:44:25.203]  Imagine, Austin cops knock on your door.
[00:44:25.243 --> 00:44:25.883]  You've been drinking.
[00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:27.944]  So they took him to the jail.
[00:44:27.984 --> 00:44:29.865]  He talked about how he pooped all over himself.
[00:44:29.885 --> 00:44:31.686]  They took him in, slammed his head into the wall.
[00:44:32.246 --> 00:44:36.648]  That's how old vets get treated in America by the scum criminals.
[00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.391]  You are scum criminals.
[00:44:39.411 --> 00:44:39.992]  I want you to know.
[00:44:40.312 --> 00:44:41.073]  I hate you.
[00:44:41.413 --> 00:44:42.274]  You're scum.
[00:44:42.594 --> 00:44:43.755]  No one should respect you.
[00:44:43.795 --> 00:44:45.036]  You're pieces of filth.
[00:44:45.836 --> 00:44:47.097]  Stop respecting government.
[00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:47.918]  Stop being nice.
[00:44:47.958 --> 00:44:49.840]  Stop calling themselves authorities.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.541]  Call themselves officials.
[00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:52.962]  They're a bunch of criminals.
[00:44:53.262 --> 00:44:54.463]  And they're not criminals.
[00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:55.965]  They're useful idiots.
[00:44:56.065 --> 00:45:04.171]  Weak-minded, little piggy-eyed people who just exploit their children and follow their little orders, their little hive, beehive system.
[00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:06.253]  You're America killing trash.
[00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:10.786]  Oh, I remember my now dead grandfather.
[00:45:10.826 --> 00:45:12.647]  He had a heart attack a few months right after it.
[00:45:13.788 --> 00:45:21.872]  Well, they said he had a heart attack right around that time, but he didn't know he had a heart attack, and then he caused a stroke, and they told him he'd had a heart attack by the enzymes and stuff they tested.
[00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:25.894]  My, uh, what was he?
[00:45:26.195 --> 00:45:27.535]  He was like 75, 76, I forget.
[00:45:27.575 --> 00:45:29.677]  He died about four years later, so, you know.
[00:45:30.717 --> 00:45:32.378]  And they never wanted to tell me.
[00:45:32.418 --> 00:45:33.519]  He didn't call me over to do it.
[00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:35.320]  He didn't hire some lawn service to do it.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.220]  He was a penny pincher.
[00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:37.801]  And, uh,
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.905]  I come over there and he's always walking around happy and in pretty good health.
[00:45:45.046 --> 00:45:46.287]  Never even went to the doctor.
[00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:49.850]  And he's sitting there in the chair and he's all mad and he's not feeling well.
[00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:50.871]  He's having trouble walking.
[00:45:51.431 --> 00:45:53.673]  He'd had the heart attack, we found out months later.
[00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:56.035]  And he goes, yeah, did you see this letter?
[00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:57.476]  I didn't want to call you over to do it.
[00:45:57.697 --> 00:46:00.239]  I was like, I guess I was about 20 at the time.
[00:46:00.259 --> 00:46:01.940]  I used to go over there every Sunday for dinner.
[00:46:02.501 --> 00:46:05.924]  He goes, they made me go into the city drainage ditch, which isn't even their property.
[00:46:06.627 --> 00:46:12.231]  Or they threaten his $2,000 a day fines and clean out all the debris and the limbs and big old limbs.
[00:46:12.711 --> 00:46:15.173]  So he went, climbed over the fence because you couldn't get to it.
[00:46:15.193 --> 00:46:16.854]  It was a green belt back there.
[00:46:16.914 --> 00:46:18.355]  Cleaned out the city gutter.
[00:46:19.716 --> 00:46:21.337]  And of course, I went and checked it.
[00:46:21.357 --> 00:46:22.298]  It wasn't their property.
[00:46:22.338 --> 00:46:23.699]  It wasn't their responsibility to do it.
[00:46:23.719 --> 00:46:25.180]  And I said, you want me to make a big stink out of it?
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.941]  He said, no, I don't want to be on TV.
[00:46:26.981 --> 00:46:29.503]  I don't want to be on your TV show.
[00:46:29.523 --> 00:46:30.164]  This was about 22 then.
[00:46:30.544 --> 00:46:31.845]  I'd actually been on the air a few years.
[00:46:33.027 --> 00:46:34.429]  And, uh, that's what they do.
[00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.531]  It's not even laws.
[00:46:35.571 --> 00:46:41.640]  It's just scum in uniforms, swaggering around, ordering us, get to work, slaves!
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.124]  And we, oh, yes, sir, we'll, we'll do it.
[00:46:46.688 --> 00:46:48.711]  But, uh, here's a letter I got from the parent.
[00:46:50.376 --> 00:46:54.178]  I guess it's okay to take a child to jail if their parents only have one car.
[00:46:54.238 --> 00:47:02.522]  Fortunately my wife was working third shift at the time and she had not been or our kid would have been taken to the police station.
[00:47:02.542 --> 00:47:11.566]  The DCFS would have been called on us simply because we only have one car and I would have not been able to get my child after being held hostage at the school.
[00:47:12.326 --> 00:47:13.227]  By the school
[00:47:14.556 --> 00:47:19.097]  We were given this paper the day before he was supposed to attend Friday school.
[00:47:19.417 --> 00:47:20.218]  Not much of a notice.
[00:47:20.698 --> 00:47:24.419]  They really didn't like the idea of my wife being there at the time.
[00:47:24.819 --> 00:47:29.540]  She said that either she was going to stay there with him or he wasn't going.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.961]  And it goes on to say, we started homeschooling this Monday.
[00:47:34.261 --> 00:47:34.882]  Absolutely.
[00:47:37.071 --> 00:47:40.752]  Homeschoolers, all the top test scorers, all the big spelling bee championships.
[00:47:40.972 --> 00:47:42.772]  They've won like, what, six years in a row now?
[00:47:43.192 --> 00:47:44.533]  The International Geography Bee.
[00:47:44.993 --> 00:47:46.853]  The corporations hungrily try to get them.
[00:47:46.973 --> 00:47:49.774]  They consistently get the biggest grants.
[00:47:50.954 --> 00:47:54.154]  I always have a mind blank on that.
[00:47:54.214 --> 00:47:55.375]  It's not called a grant.
[00:47:55.395 --> 00:47:56.955]  It's not called a tuition.
[00:47:57.415 --> 00:48:01.316]  What's it called when the university system pays for your college?
[00:48:02.636 --> 00:48:04.417]  What's that called, Scott?
[00:48:05.217 --> 00:48:06.657]  When the university pays for your tuition?
[00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:10.063]  No, it's not called Freeride.
[00:48:10.844 --> 00:48:14.007]  It's called a... Okay, this is ridiculous.
[00:48:15.008 --> 00:48:18.893]  The last few times I've tried to think of the word, it's a... Scholarship!
[00:48:19.774 --> 00:48:20.615]  Gosh almighty.
[00:48:21.175 --> 00:48:23.098]  They get the highest scholarships on average.
[00:48:23.118 --> 00:48:23.999]  Go look at all the numbers.
[00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:25.961]  Because they're not ruined.
[00:48:28.248 --> 00:48:28.828]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:31.650]  Type in state cracks down on homeschooling.
[00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:33.852]  Type in governor seeks to outlaw homeschooling.
[00:48:33.872 --> 00:48:35.313]  You'll get Illinois, California.
[00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.375]  Man, the CPS is coming after them.
[00:48:38.895 --> 00:48:41.277]  Neighbors think it's weird that the child isn't at school.
[00:48:41.337 --> 00:48:42.077]  Call the police.
[00:48:42.358 --> 00:48:43.498]  We're a sick tattletale.
[00:48:43.538 --> 00:48:45.840]  It's not just the cops and the government and the CPS workers.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.581]  We're scum as a country.
[00:48:48.462 --> 00:48:49.743]  I mean, a large portion of us.
[00:48:51.183 --> 00:48:53.145]  We really are like demons or something.
[00:48:54.406 --> 00:48:54.906]  I mean, really.
[00:48:59.426 --> 00:49:00.186]  It goes on here.
[00:49:00.907 --> 00:49:02.908]  But this is all color of law in Indiana.
[00:49:02.968 --> 00:49:04.708]  It's color of law in Houston where they do it.
[00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:06.349]  And it's color of law everywhere.
[00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:12.532]  They tell you last minute, oh by the way, you're not there in 15 minutes after they let out.
[00:49:12.852 --> 00:49:15.914]  And I remember lots of times, my dad would get stuck in traffic or something would happen.
[00:49:16.194 --> 00:49:20.176]  After football practice, my mom, I might have to wait, not all the time, but sometimes an hour.
[00:49:20.996 --> 00:49:23.957]  And we'd play pass football, touch football.
[00:49:26.818 --> 00:49:31.321]  God forbid in sixth grade, walk down to the EZ Mart and get a Gatorade or something.
[00:49:33.502 --> 00:49:34.763]  Oh no, that's another thing.
[00:49:34.983 --> 00:49:36.784]  A lot of kids I knew lived by the school.
[00:49:36.804 --> 00:49:37.484]  They'd walk home.
[00:49:37.544 --> 00:49:38.905]  Uh-uh, they got fences now, folks.
[00:49:38.925 --> 00:49:40.006]  You don't get offered lunch.
[00:49:40.326 --> 00:49:42.407]  You don't get to walk home if you live a block away.
[00:49:42.967 --> 00:49:50.592]  Your parents will be here or you're going to the police station and CPS will be waiting to ask, why weren't you there to get your child?
[00:49:52.108 --> 00:49:54.030]  And then a lot of parents don't know their rights, so they trick them.
[00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.091]  We'll just sign this form.
[00:49:55.231 --> 00:49:56.373]  The child goes under observation.
[00:49:56.413 --> 00:49:57.153]  Everything will be alright.
[00:49:57.354 --> 00:49:58.114]  We'll take him if you don't.
[00:49:58.555 --> 00:49:59.596]  Alright, I'll be reasonable.
[00:49:59.676 --> 00:50:02.019]  And literally, when you sign that, sometimes they'll even laugh.
[00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:02.519]  Ha ha!
[00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:03.540]  Alright, that's it.
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.762]  Your child is being taken into custody.
[00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:07.204]  What do you mean you said if I signed it?
[00:50:07.364 --> 00:50:08.365]  Just keep complying.
[00:50:08.385 --> 00:50:09.306]  Everything will be alright.
[00:50:09.526 --> 00:50:11.949]  Folks, you can't imagine how monstrous they are.
[00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:14.752]  The Soviet Union wasn't this bad.
[00:50:15.891 --> 00:50:17.812]  The Communist Chinese aren't like this.
[00:50:17.832 --> 00:50:22.035]  You know, they'll kill you and take your organs, but as for just every day, it's all about spider webs.
[00:50:22.335 --> 00:50:24.677]  Bureaucracies set up spider webs.
[00:50:25.157 --> 00:50:26.198]  Nets to catch you.
[00:50:27.159 --> 00:50:28.880]  It's not about your child.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.141]  It's not about education.
[00:50:30.161 --> 00:50:32.022]  Of course, the idiots implementing it think that.
[00:50:32.962 --> 00:50:34.243]  It's about control.
[00:50:34.323 --> 00:50:35.484]  Getting you into the system.
[00:50:35.724 --> 00:50:36.785]  By hook or by crook.
[00:50:38.446 --> 00:50:40.407]  Unbelievably criminal.
[00:50:40.507 --> 00:50:41.168]  It is criminal!
[00:50:42.088 --> 00:50:43.428]  There's no law.
[00:50:43.869 --> 00:50:45.529]  Send your child to the police station.
[00:50:45.569 --> 00:50:49.651]  There's no... It's just policy.
[00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:50.891]  Get them in the system.
[00:50:52.351 --> 00:50:53.472]  I got a bunch of other news.
[00:50:53.572 --> 00:50:54.492]  Masses of guests.
[00:50:54.572 --> 00:50:56.353]  Unbelievable amounts of information.
[00:50:56.633 --> 00:50:58.253]  I haven't even scratched the surface today.
[00:50:59.134 --> 00:50:59.794]  It's unbelievable.
[00:51:04.608 --> 00:51:05.068]  It's here!
[00:51:05.288 --> 00:51:10.070]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:18.092]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.773 --> 00:51:25.835]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.215 --> 00:51:33.077]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.604 --> 00:51:37.646]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.946 --> 00:51:41.468]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.928 --> 00:51:43.829]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:48.092]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.332 --> 00:53:09.260]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.883]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:54:04.568 --> 00:54:05.049]  Don't worry.
[00:54:05.529 --> 00:54:07.071]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.572 --> 00:54:10.315]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.657 --> 00:54:17.624]  They abolished the Bill of Rights.
[00:54:17.644 --> 00:54:18.105]  Friday.
[00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:20.127]  Of course, it doesn't mean that it isn't still in effect.
[00:54:20.147 --> 00:54:20.848]  These are criminals.
[00:54:20.868 --> 00:54:21.349]  It's illegitimate.
[00:54:22.616 --> 00:54:25.359]  But the courts are already violating the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:54:25.539 --> 00:54:26.480]  They're doing it everywhere.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:44.154]  They're just practicing the tyranny against you, training you, using movies and TV shows where it shows the police violating people, shows like Cops where it shows them violating people, where the citizens are always toothless white trash, who are always guilty, selling you on the image of they're the good cops in uniform, we're the white trash.
[00:54:44.674 --> 00:54:46.436]  You see, all of this is crafted
[00:54:47.887 --> 00:54:49.548]  And if you're not a bad cop, I'm not against you.
[00:54:50.188 --> 00:54:52.069]  The system is rotten and is bad.
[00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:54.410]  And if you doubt that... I mean, look at Foley.
[00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.111]  Missy and exploited children.
[00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:57.612]  And he's a big, fat perv.
[00:54:58.312 --> 00:55:01.154]  Well, of course the people involved in all that stuff are the pervs.
[00:55:02.514 --> 00:55:03.535]  That's criminology.
[00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.236]  In fact, if you'd had any real law enforcement training, you'd know that.
[00:55:06.256 --> 00:55:07.817]  It's not too late.
[00:55:07.857 --> 00:55:08.797]  Go buy some textbooks.
[00:55:08.817 --> 00:55:12.019]  You can school yourself in what you weren't taught at the academy.
[00:55:14.306 --> 00:55:18.252]  Look at this, FBI worries about Al-Qaeda ties to Mob.
[00:55:19.594 --> 00:55:22.619]  This is pure bull, and notice it's always speculation.
[00:55:23.402 --> 00:55:26.825]  The FBI's top counter-terrorism official harbors lots of concerns.
[00:55:27.325 --> 00:55:35.953]  Weapons of mass destruction, undetected, homegrown terrorists, and the possibility that old-fashioned mobsters will team up with Al-Qaeda for the right price.
[00:55:36.293 --> 00:55:44.520]  And it goes on to say there's no evidence of this, but let's just have a press conference and say Al-Qaeda is everywhere and working with normal criminals, so normal crime is terror.
[00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.281]  I want to get into that later.
[00:55:46.742 --> 00:55:51.666]  Steve Watson's coming up with this huge report on the fake hijacker video.
[00:55:52.714 --> 00:55:54.756]  By fake, we know it was released by the government.
[00:55:55.137 --> 00:55:56.759]  We know it had already been on TV before.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.881]  How dumb do they think we are?
[00:55:59.562 --> 00:56:00.403]  Before we go any further...
[00:56:01.855 --> 00:56:08.397]  My friends, I want you to go to InfoWars.com and I want you to get the two incredible films on one DVD for only $19.95.
[00:56:09.538 --> 00:56:21.882]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, remastered, new information added with a whole new film, The Order of Death, with the footage shot in 2005 at the cremation of care by an employee of the Grove inside the altar.
[00:56:22.262 --> 00:56:24.283]  The mock human sacrifice they do of a child.
[00:56:24.603 --> 00:56:27.024]  This is your Christian Conservative pervert Republicans.
[00:56:29.205 --> 00:56:34.709]  It gets into how they bust in the $2,000 an hour gay porn stars for themselves.
[00:56:34.729 --> 00:56:36.610]  It's all in this film.
[00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:38.512]  Bush kissing on Gannon.
[00:56:40.473 --> 00:56:41.313]  Christian conservatism.
[00:56:41.353 --> 00:56:42.134]  You know, men kissing men.
[00:56:42.154 --> 00:56:42.554]  It's Christian.
[00:56:42.574 --> 00:56:43.634]  I'm very conservative.
[00:56:44.135 --> 00:56:48.957]  You need to have this film, The Order of Death and Dark Secrets of Sal Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:49.177 --> 00:56:52.358]  Two films on one DVD!
[00:56:52.378 --> 00:56:52.358]  1995.
[00:56:52.678 --> 00:56:55.099]  You need to get my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:56:55.159 --> 00:56:57.620]  If you've already gotten a copy and you like it, buy a couple copies.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:58.781]  We need your support.
[00:56:59.081 --> 00:57:00.741]  Give them to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:02.582]  Give them as a birthday present, as a Christmas present.
[00:57:03.022 --> 00:57:03.382]  Don't wait.
[00:57:03.402 --> 00:57:04.443]  Give it as an early gift.
[00:57:04.463 --> 00:57:05.543]  Hey, here's your present early.
[00:57:05.924 --> 00:57:06.604]  Be informed.
[00:57:07.784 --> 00:57:09.405]  Go to InfoWars.com today.
[00:57:10.788 --> 00:57:13.329]  Look at the 16 different specials we have up there.
[00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:16.770]  Well, my films are as low as $5.95 when you get multiple copies.
[00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:22.111]  The other books and videos, Loose Change 2nd Edition, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, an incredible film, $19.95.
[00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:24.552]  They're all available.
[00:57:24.572 --> 00:57:25.232]  You support us.
[00:57:25.252 --> 00:57:26.492]  You support the other filmmakers.
[00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:27.813]  You get a powerful tool.
[00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:29.293]  You're authorized and encouraged.
[00:57:29.333 --> 00:57:31.053]  I beg you to make copies of my films.
[00:57:31.394 --> 00:57:32.174]  Like Terror Storm.
[00:57:32.274 --> 00:57:33.494]  Continue making copies.
[00:57:33.534 --> 00:57:34.374]  It's having an effect.
[00:57:34.915 --> 00:57:36.995]  We can stop these terrorists if we expose them.
[00:57:37.175 --> 00:57:37.755]  It's up to you.
[00:57:37.795 --> 00:57:38.596]  The ball's in your court.
[00:57:38.616 --> 00:57:38.636]  1-888
[00:57:40.913 --> 00:57:45.435]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 is the toll-free number to order.

[00:58:07.174 --> 00:58:09.115]  A bunch of other special reports we've done.
[00:58:09.135 --> 00:58:12.357]  It's just ridiculous how much stuff you get for 15 cents a day.
[00:58:12.698 --> 00:58:13.978]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.801]  And yes, don't forget, I uploaded Terror Storm.
[00:58:17.821 --> 00:58:20.663]  It's such an important film for free to Google Video.
[00:58:20.683 --> 00:58:25.006]  And they've been caught knocking out our stats again, so we won't go into the top 100.
[00:58:26.767 --> 00:58:27.867]  I want you to go nuts.
[00:58:28.288 --> 00:58:30.269]  Please help us get Terror Storm.
[00:58:31.144 --> 00:58:32.225]  Off Google Video for free.
[00:58:32.325 --> 00:58:33.205]  Email it to everyone.
[00:58:33.405 --> 00:58:34.886]  Put it on every message board you can.
[00:58:35.166 --> 00:58:38.587]  Call into radio talk shows and tell them about TerrorStorm and the free download.
[00:58:38.828 --> 00:58:39.748]  Help me get it out!
[00:58:41.249 --> 00:58:45.931]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.691 --> 00:58:58.351]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.992 --> 00:59:00.052]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.772 --> 00:59:01.873]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.533 --> 00:59:03.353]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.094 --> 00:59:05.054]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.674 --> 00:59:09.376]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.836 --> 00:59:13.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.018 --> 00:59:17.619]  I'm living in the Twilight Zone.
[00:59:17.879 --> 00:59:23.321]  The Houston Police Chief is out calling for cameras to be put in people's homes to keep them safe.
[00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:31.497]  In Illinois, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, they're calling to make businesses, to put cameras in with the police watching everyone.
[00:59:32.898 --> 00:59:45.003]  Google Video openly has come out, not Google Video, but Google itself, and said they're going to use the video cameras and audio systems that are built into many new PC's, Standard and Macs, to listen to you and watch you.
[00:59:45.563 --> 00:59:46.303]  They've announced it!
[00:59:46.323 --> 00:59:46.764]  Okay?
[00:59:47.064 --> 00:59:50.325]  I'm living in some type of twilight zone!
[00:59:51.326 --> 00:59:52.306]  I just covered a little
[00:59:52.995 --> 01:00:15.418]  town run by a bunch of sickos uh... and uh... tell city indiana where they where your child has done all their homework they make them stay after school and if you're fifteen minutes late picking them up I would have been at the police station all the time with my parents when they were usually you know either on time or twenty minutes late
[01:00:16.724 --> 01:00:17.465]  It's over, folks.
[01:00:17.485 --> 01:00:21.768]  You go to the police station and CPS begins interrogations and they try to take your child.
[01:00:22.049 --> 01:00:23.089]  It's actually in the news.
[01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.351]  We're talking 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th graders.
[01:00:25.672 --> 01:00:26.152]  Right up until 12th.
[01:00:26.212 --> 01:00:27.793]  You're not allowed to leave the school.
[01:00:27.813 --> 01:00:28.354]  You're a prisoner.
[01:00:28.554 --> 01:00:30.215]  To get in, you gotta have pass cards.
[01:00:31.617 --> 01:00:36.761]  And your child is questioned by people who are five times, conservatively, more likely to be pedophiles.
[01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:38.322]  That's your CPS.
[01:00:38.342 --> 01:00:39.103]  Go look up those numbers.
[01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:45.885]  Just like Mr. Head of the Missing and Exploded Children, Mr. Foley.
[01:00:46.025 --> 01:00:47.785]  Oh, the government's good.
[01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:55.449]  It's a pack of crooks with a bunch of useful idiots with low IQs around them just pulling paychecks, don't know what's going on right next to them.
[01:00:56.371 --> 01:00:58.212]  North American Union's being set up.
[01:00:58.292 --> 01:00:59.733]  Total tyranny's being set up.
[01:01:00.013 --> 01:01:01.294]  Everything's being dismantled.
[01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:03.075]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[01:01:03.315 --> 01:01:04.276]  Poison in the water.
[01:01:04.336 --> 01:01:05.577]  Poison in the vaccines.
[01:01:05.977 --> 01:01:21.367]  Our government's openly calling for one-child policies and now saying sterilization of people on welfare is good and total police state and just open borders and 30 million illegals running all over us and brainwashed police and cameras and microphones everywhere.
[01:01:23.315 --> 01:01:26.266]  I mean, we need to seriously freak out, folks!
[01:01:26.326 --> 01:01:27.851]  We are in freak out mode!
[01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:39.020]  I mean, we've already known the NSA is using the microphones on the cable boxes and using your phone to dial in as a microphone in your house to listen to you.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.341]  That's all declassified now.
[01:01:40.561 --> 01:01:52.449]  But now Google and other major industry companies are bragging, because Google brags in their own press release, well, we're not like the other companies that have keyword software that listens to the audio in your house off the microphone.
[01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.190]  No, we do even better.
[01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:59.614]  We have a super good system that listens to your voice and the TV and even how many pets you have.
[01:02:01.035 --> 01:02:03.596]  I mean, this is Big Brother on steroids!
[01:02:04.396 --> 01:02:05.317]  It's happening, folks.
[01:02:05.717 --> 01:02:08.939]  They abolished the Bill of Rights last Friday.
[01:02:09.339 --> 01:02:09.859]  Mayday!
[01:02:10.219 --> 01:02:10.740]  Alert!
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:11.660]  Alert!
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.540]  Alert!
[01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:13.561]  Mayday!
[01:02:13.801 --> 01:02:14.221]  Mayday!
[01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:17.323]  In fact, worldwide, people listening on shortwave, internet, satellite,
[01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:18.911]  I'm Alex Jones!
[01:02:18.931 --> 01:02:20.392]  The United States has been seized!
[01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:21.193]  Help us!
[01:02:21.413 --> 01:02:23.595]  Act, you know, behave like it's been seized!
[01:02:23.635 --> 01:02:25.156]  Don't just yell, the tyranny's pretty bad!
[01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:29.820]  No, I mean, this is like, this is like revolutionary been seized!
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:43.491]  I mean, this is like we should be huddling and talking about what we can do to get the country back and constantly thinking about it and constantly, you know, getting the information out however we can, every waking hour, freaked out, constantly dealing with this!
[01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:46.153]  I mean, folks!
[01:02:48.033 --> 01:02:50.334]  It is hitting us from every angle.
[01:02:50.414 --> 01:02:52.535]  I mean, I want it to hit you full-on.
[01:02:53.935 --> 01:02:57.017]  I want people to know worldwide that we've been seized.
[01:02:57.557 --> 01:02:59.257]  We have been completely grabbed.
[01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:01.438]  They're openly talking about shutting down free speech.
[01:03:01.738 --> 01:03:07.501]  Neocons are talking about how I need to be arrested and how I shouldn't be on the radio, on national radio they're saying this.
[01:03:08.301 --> 01:03:10.262]  They're calling for people to be shut up.
[01:03:10.622 --> 01:03:13.443]  They're talking about when the next terror attack happens they're going to arrest everybody.
[01:03:15.217 --> 01:03:20.740]  Our government is run by terrorists that carried out 9-11, and people again can't deal with that.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.461]  What about the Tuskegee experiment?
[01:03:22.481 --> 01:03:24.782]  What about the radiated soldiers and children?
[01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:26.683]  What about the sterilizations?
[01:03:26.763 --> 01:03:29.644]  What about all the other crimes this government's committed?
[01:03:29.664 --> 01:03:32.746]  See, when somebody argues with you, mention all the admitted stuff!
[01:03:32.806 --> 01:03:35.807]  That's why Google Video is so afraid of TerrorStorm.
[01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:39.009]  Because we give you the undisputed history first,
[01:03:39.762 --> 01:03:45.927]  It is convincing almost everyone that sees it and so they're knocking us out of the top 100 so you can't find out the truth.
[01:03:46.307 --> 01:03:47.048]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:47.068 --> 01:03:47.608]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.403 --> 01:03:59.585]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.926 --> 01:04:01.867]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.227 --> 01:04:09.893]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.573 --> 01:04:17.618]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.018 --> 01:04:20.960]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.662]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.102 --> 01:04:24.903]  NSA spying.
[01:04:25.396 --> 01:04:29.458]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.738 --> 01:04:33.260]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.621]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:39.883]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:56.520]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.603]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.723 --> 01:05:03.305]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.365 --> 01:05:05.687]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:05.867 --> 01:05:14.314]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:14.394 --> 01:05:15.715]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:19.838]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:19.838 --> 01:05:20.338]  We're good to go!
[01:05:40.347 --> 01:05:42.589]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:42.609 --> 01:05:44.410]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:48.353]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:05:48.433 --> 01:05:51.135]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:12.732]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:17.435]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:18.015 --> 01:06:20.997]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:21.957 --> 01:06:24.879]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.061]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:28.101 --> 01:06:30.803]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:39.219 --> 01:06:39.519]  U.S.
[01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:42.501]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:51.366]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[01:06:53.167 --> 01:07:00.871]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.231 --> 01:07:07.495]  Hi, Steve Watson joins us in this hour.
[01:07:09.252 --> 01:07:11.854]  To talk about the incredible analysis he put together.
[01:07:11.874 --> 01:07:13.755]  Thanks for some tips from listeners.
[01:07:15.717 --> 01:07:37.792]  Concerning the fact that the footage being bandied around now for the last 6-7 days, since last Friday, of Mohammed Adda and other supposed hijackers giving their little last will and testament to Allah, I mean, not only does it not look like him, not only is Adda 10 years younger, not only has his father said it isn't him,
[01:07:38.698 --> 01:08:01.404]  Not only have they put out fake Fat Bin Laden tapes before that have been voice printed and proven to be frauds, not only have they claimed that they killed Zarqawi over twelve times, all of the past fake videos coming out of Virginia and Houston from government servers, it had aired in a docudrama on television, the footage had aired before, and now the Times of London is saying this footage didn't come from Al Qaeda.
[01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.944]  So joining us is Steve Watson.
[01:08:04.964 --> 01:08:05.985]  Steve, thank you for coming on.
[01:08:06.005 --> 01:08:07.445]  It's good to be on Alex.
[01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:17.716]  Steve, your brother's been on here a lot, but you do almost as much work as he does behind the scenes at Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:18.476 --> 01:08:19.656]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:08:19.676 --> 01:08:20.857]  You're actually the older brother.
[01:08:21.477 --> 01:08:27.920]  Tell us, just in a nutshell, about Steve Watson and your education and what you do there in London, and then we'll get into your report.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:36.763]  Yeah, well, after 9-11, I sort of felt that I needed to know more about the way the world works, really.
[01:08:37.695 --> 01:08:41.998]  So, I took a course, a Master's Degree in International Relations.
[01:08:43.078 --> 01:09:01.890]  I went back to university in Nottingham and basically they tried to teach us that Mao is good and NAFTA is good, GATT is good and things just didn't add up for me and I don't really think they they sort of liked the work that I was producing for them.
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:05.812]  I didn't get an astounding mark but I passed and now
[01:09:07.054 --> 01:09:07.675]  Everything's good.
[01:09:07.715 --> 01:09:08.755]  I'm working for you.
[01:09:10.877 --> 01:09:16.281]  By the way, Nottingham, you hail from where old Robin Hood's from.
[01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:18.703]  Robin Hood country, yeah.
[01:09:19.123 --> 01:09:19.884]  You and your brother.
[01:09:20.384 --> 01:09:21.905]  Alright, but you live in London now.
[01:09:22.566 --> 01:09:23.587]  Get into this report.
[01:09:23.647 --> 01:09:26.509]  Break it down for people because I don't think some of the listeners realize
[01:09:27.555 --> 01:09:29.336]  How big this story is.
[01:09:29.396 --> 01:09:31.757]  You've done one report, the original report, very lengthy.
[01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:37.060]  Your brother has done two supplementary reports that are up on all the websites right now.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.141]  Everybody should get these.
[01:09:38.721 --> 01:09:40.122]  And again, get them out to everybody.
[01:09:40.642 --> 01:09:43.143]  And we should force the media, hey, this isn't real.
[01:09:43.224 --> 01:09:44.504]  Hey, they're lying about this.
[01:09:44.844 --> 01:09:46.345]  Hey, you guys have done this again.
[01:09:46.845 --> 01:09:47.626]  Break it down for us.
[01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:52.827]  Basically, this broke over the weekend.
[01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:59.808]  It was released to the London Times, the Sunday Times, to a journalist called UC Fowler.
[01:10:01.808 --> 01:10:09.390]  And basically it shows Bin Laden addressing a rally in Kandahar in Afghanistan in January 2000.
[01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:17.351]  The first thing I think we should talk about is the lack of sound, because basically I
[01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:22.547]  I was on the London Times website trying to play this through and there's no sound.
[01:10:22.587 --> 01:10:24.229]  I thought there was something wrong with my computer.
[01:10:24.249 --> 01:10:26.771]  I'm trying to turn the volume up.
[01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:35.058]  But basically, we're told that there's no sound because Al-Qaeda's forgot to add the soundtrack, rather conveniently.
[01:10:36.679 --> 01:10:47.168]  In the same... In fact, ABC did a report with the Times journalist who said, all throughout the report, that Al-Qaeda had become very technologically
[01:10:48.382 --> 01:10:55.123]  Competent, yet they can't add a soundtrack to a video that they produce.
[01:10:55.763 --> 01:10:57.704]  I mean, it's quite simple, really.
[01:10:58.424 --> 01:11:04.605]  But basically, we're told that Atta and Jarrah, the two 9-11 hijackers, are reading the Last Will and Testament.
[01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:09.766]  But I don't know how we're supposed to know this, because there's no sound.
[01:11:10.446 --> 01:11:17.607]  We're simply told that on the scrap of paper Mohammed Atta's looking at, it says, The Will, in Arabic.
[01:11:19.147 --> 01:11:25.151]  Well, I can't read Arabic, but it's very hard to decipher anything on the paper that he's looking at.
[01:11:26.292 --> 01:11:34.017]  Then we're told that lip readers analysed the video, but they couldn't decipher anything that the two of them were saying.
[01:11:36.539 --> 01:11:44.965]  Why they couldn't is not explained, because the lips are clearly visible, and obviously the Pentagon has got Arabic-speaking lip readers.
[01:11:46.246 --> 01:11:48.287]  But basically, to break it all down, this means that
[01:11:48.928 --> 01:11:51.289]  The lack of sound, it prevents voice analysis.
[01:11:52.429 --> 01:12:08.416]  And we know that in 2002 there was a tape released, a Bin Laden tape, which was proven to be a total fake, because basically it was analysed by an institute in Switzerland, which always analyses Bin Laden tapes.
[01:12:08.456 --> 01:12:12.758]  And basically they said this one was not Bin Laden, it was a complete fraud.
[01:12:15.422 --> 01:12:23.944]  And then a linguist in other countries, what France and Canada studied it too, it wasn't just not the same voice print, it was a totally different dialect.
[01:12:23.984 --> 01:12:33.827]  But again, all of this propaganda is very shoddy, almost by design, so the general public just hears the news, then later it gets retracted, but deep in the paper,
[01:12:34.915 --> 01:12:36.836]  Yeah, you just called me Paul by the way, Alex.
[01:13:01.266 --> 01:13:03.527]  Well, I've had him on a million times and never had... Okay, that's right.
[01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.487]  This is Steve Watson.
[01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.408]  From now on, you're going to be known as Paul.
[01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:06.768]  Go ahead.
[01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:20.234]  Okay, well, if we get over the issue that there's no sound on the video, basically, if you watch the unedited version of it, it's totally strange.
[01:13:20.314 --> 01:13:30.978]  It's a sort of weird snapshot effect, where it's panning around the crowd of people that are listening to Bin Laden speaking, and it sort of freezes and frames
[01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:32.645]  Different faces.
[01:13:33.546 --> 01:13:36.548]  As if it's sort of cataloguing them.
[01:13:37.929 --> 01:13:43.454]  And there's even a large section of it that primarily focuses on children.
[01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:49.238]  And it freezes on different children, as if it's sort of creating a surveillance catalogue of them.
[01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:57.285]  And it's this aspect of it that's sort of baffled experts as well, terrorism experts.
[01:13:57.305 --> 01:14:01.168]  There was an Egyptian expert on Islamic terrorism
[01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:31.287]  called Dia Rashwan who described to the Associated Press described the video as so out of character for Al-Qaeda that it could have been taken by a security agency and not only this we've got the father of Mohammed Atta as well who's come out this has only been reported in a couple of foreign papers one of them was in Saudi Arabia told them that the tape's totally fake and
[01:14:32.307 --> 01:14:34.829]  He said that it's, quote, not my boy.
[01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:38.592]  He said the Americans have tampered with and falsified that video.
[01:14:39.193 --> 01:14:42.216]  They want to change the truth in order to achieve their goals in the Middle East.
[01:14:43.417 --> 01:14:51.544]  And you'd think that would be quite a major story in the media, but I've not seen it in any American papers or any British papers.
[01:14:52.384 --> 01:14:56.728]  The only place I've seen it is in a German publication and this Saudi Arabian one.
[01:14:59.545 --> 01:15:09.451]  The AP piece also highlights how the appearance of the hijackers is strangely different from the mug shots that the FBI released after 9-11.
[01:15:11.873 --> 01:15:24.581]  Linking in, I pointed out in the article that I did that Zayad Jarrar, who was the pilot, the supposed pilot of Flight 93 that crashed into the field in Pennsylvania, it's been confirmed that he
[01:15:25.262 --> 01:15:33.368]  He was not a 9-11 hijacker, or the man in this latest video who is said to be Gerard is not a 9-11 hijacker.
[01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:40.754]  If you check the article I wrote, there are five different pictures that are supposedly the same man.
[01:15:41.734 --> 01:15:46.998]  And clearly, there are up to three different people in those pictures.
[01:15:47.399 --> 01:15:53.103]  But the key one is the passport photo that was miraculously found in the wreckage.
[01:15:54.904 --> 01:16:05.672]  If you compare that picture, which is basically the whole story that he was on that flight hinges on that picture, which is ridiculous in itself.
[01:16:05.753 --> 01:16:10.596]  But if you compare that to the man in this video, they're certainly not the same person.
[01:16:12.578 --> 01:16:20.244]  Gerard's family also came out a week after 9-11 and provided proof to CNN that he wasn't on the plane.
[01:16:22.528 --> 01:16:28.692]  Um, BBC have reported since then that at least seven hijackers are alive.
[01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.653]  Others have reported it to LA Times.
[01:16:30.933 --> 01:16:39.658]  Then there were two other people with the exact same names as one of the hijackers who looked the same that in the month after 9-11 crashed and died at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:16:40.419 --> 01:16:41.059]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:41.079 --> 01:16:44.821]  I mean, there's sort of doubles of these patsies all over the place.
[01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:50.445]  I mean, there was a video released last month which seems to have been forgotten.
[01:16:51.007 --> 01:17:00.089]  But it was only last month, but it was Bin Laden with two of the hijackers, two of the supposed hijackers, Wal Ashiri and Hasmah Al-Ghamdi.
[01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:06.410]  Now, Al-Shiri was reported alive by the BBC after 9-11.
[01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:09.530]  They did a full piece on this which I linked in my article.
[01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:14.711]  And the other one, Al-Ghamdi, was interviewed by the London Telegraph after 9-11.
[01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:19.592]  So they're both still alive, yet we've got them in a video
[01:17:20.299 --> 01:17:21.079]  With Bin Laden.
[01:17:21.099 --> 01:17:28.442]  But again, this is not even complex, it's just somewhat, it takes a little bit of focus to keep track of it.
[01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:38.366]  No, we'll just show you a brown person and say he's admitting to it and here's your proof and there's no sound and, by the way, we've released these videos before but we're saying these are brand new.
[01:17:38.406 --> 01:17:41.567]  This time, you know, I think that's the strongest evidence.
[01:17:42.087 --> 01:17:42.787]  Well, exactly.
[01:17:43.107 --> 01:17:46.089]  Basically, it's the lowest, they're going for the lowest common denominator.
[01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:47.329]  They're aiming at people who just
[01:17:47.947 --> 01:17:48.427]  Look at it.
[01:17:48.467 --> 01:17:51.229]  Won't even watch the whole thing and just go, yeah, that proves it for me.
[01:17:52.710 --> 01:18:05.178]  But basically, the important thing about the tape is they're saying it's a missing link that completes a jigsaw of where Mohammed Atta was in the event, in the time leading up to 9-11.
[01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:14.824]  The Times said that American and German investigators have struggled to find evidence of where Atta was in January 2000.
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.701]  After he disappeared from the cell in Hamburg, the terrorist cell he was with.
[01:18:21.941 --> 01:18:28.943]  And they're basically touting this tape as the missing link to place him in Afghanistan in January 2000.
[01:18:29.423 --> 01:18:38.004]  Stay there Steve Watson, we're going to come back and go to the other key points of the story that when they're taken together proves this latest footage is a complete fraud.
[01:18:38.565 --> 01:18:40.225]  The entire story is a scam.
[01:18:40.245 --> 01:18:45.366]  This is being done to bolster the sagging and collapsing official fable
[01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:48.949]  Of September 11th attacks five years and a month ago.
[01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:50.431]  We'll be right back, stay with us.

[01:19:53.647 --> 01:19:57.551]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.771 --> 01:20:10.042]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.482 --> 01:20:10.882]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.922 --> 01:20:16.507]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.908 --> 01:20:19.110]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:22.031]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:22.071 --> 01:20:24.912]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:25.012 --> 01:20:31.053]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:23:02.061 --> 01:23:11.646]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll play an ABC News clip that Steve was talking about.
[01:23:20.965 --> 01:23:25.448]  Paul Watson's brother, another one of the Infowars team members over on the Prison Planet side.
[01:23:25.808 --> 01:23:28.069]  Alright, now getting to the real meat and potatoes.
[01:23:29.009 --> 01:23:40.216]  You've set the table here where they've had fake Bin Laden tapes, there's all these other weird inconsistencies, the way the video zooms in, what the family's saying, what terrorist experts are saying.
[01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:44.518]  Now the Times of London is saying that Al-Qaeda didn't release this videotape.
[01:23:45.183 --> 01:23:46.304]  That Owl C.I.A.
[01:23:46.324 --> 01:23:47.224]  did, obviously.
[01:23:48.025 --> 01:23:55.469]  But let's get into the real, you know, the center of the argument, the proof that the official story is a lie.
[01:23:55.489 --> 01:24:00.733]  They're claiming this tape just appeared, but it turns out large excerpts of this have been on television before, Paul.
[01:24:01.053 --> 01:24:01.353]  Steve?
[01:24:02.154 --> 01:24:03.394]  Now you've really messed me up, Steve.
[01:24:03.434 --> 01:24:03.755]  Go ahead.
[01:24:04.755 --> 01:24:14.101]  Yeah, well, basically, the quote was it was officially obtained via a tested channel by the London Times.
[01:24:15.545 --> 01:24:26.728]  Um, but the Times itself in its article refers to US sources that have already analyzed it, so what they mean by that, I mean, it's unexplained.
[01:24:27.008 --> 01:24:30.609]  Yeah, the CIA or whatever federal agency is a tested channel.
[01:24:31.129 --> 01:24:31.549]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:32.869]  A tested sewer line.
[01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:39.291]  So, on the one hand they're saying that Al Qaeda's released this, but then on the other they're sort of intimating that
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.342]  It's been released to them via an American intelligence agency.
[01:24:43.362 --> 01:24:45.084]  Yeah, these liars cover themselves.
[01:24:45.124 --> 01:24:49.767]  It's always real vague, so that now that we've caught them, it's incredible.
[01:24:49.787 --> 01:24:52.329]  Well, exactly.
[01:24:52.369 --> 01:24:57.493]  And, I mean, experts... NBC said it had exclusive U.S.
[01:24:57.813 --> 01:25:03.517]  intelligence analysis of every frame, and this was sort of moments after the Times had received it.
[01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:09.238]  They admitted in their own report that the video was found in Afghanistan in 2001.
[01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:23.907]  And another interesting thing is, in an article NBC wrote to accompany the report, they said that they'd filed a Freedom of Information Act request earlier this year for the same tape.
[01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:39.413]  But all over national news, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and today, Al-Qaeda releases a sweeper cell tape, meant to trigger assassins, mass bombers, something bigger than 9-11 could hit us by the end of the month.
[01:25:39.553 --> 01:25:42.275]  Al-Qaeda releases a tape, boldly.
[01:25:42.916 --> 01:25:44.437]  That is a lie right there.
[01:25:45.118 --> 01:25:45.838]  Well, exactly.
[01:25:46.459 --> 01:25:52.243]  NBC basically openly admitted that, without saying it outright, that the government has released it.
[01:25:52.671 --> 01:25:58.294]  And they did it via the London Times to basically distance themselves away from it.
[01:25:58.714 --> 01:26:00.195]  That's all basically a smoke screen.
[01:26:00.795 --> 01:26:12.181]  But getting to the fact that it's been seen before, there's basically a listener to the show who alerted me to this, and I should thank him, his name's James Dorman.
[01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:20.105]  He pointed out that the footage of the rally, not the footage of Muhammad Atta and Jarrah, but the footage of the rally,
[01:26:21.258 --> 01:26:40.755]  It's featured in a docudrama that was made called The Road to Guantanamo and it was first broadcast in this country seven months ago in March and that kind of ties in with the NBC Freedom of Information request as well which was made around the same time for the same tape.
[01:26:41.316 --> 01:26:48.362]  The docudrama basically follows three British detainees at Guantanamo who were later released because they were
[01:26:48.797 --> 01:26:53.399]  Like everybody else, they're totally unconnected to Al-Qaeda and have nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:26:53.539 --> 01:26:55.000]  Yeah, real Al-Qaeda is U.S.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:00.062]  intelligence, but they have to have this illusion and set the precedent to torture people.
[01:27:00.102 --> 01:27:01.382]  That's what these camps are all about.
[01:27:02.002 --> 01:27:02.703]  Well, exactly, yeah.
[01:27:03.143 --> 01:27:15.528]  And the relevance of the fact that it was in that docudrama is that in the Road to Guantanamo, it's being shown to inmates as an intelligence surveillance tape.
[01:27:17.224 --> 01:27:32.350]  The context of the clip portrays doctored... they're basically showing doctored footage to the detainees where they've put the detainees' faces into the video, edited in with CGI.
[01:27:34.402 --> 01:27:37.263]  Uh, to try and get them to confess that they were there at that time.
[01:27:37.283 --> 01:27:40.005]  So in the documentary, they're admitting it's a doctored tape.
[01:27:40.025 --> 01:27:41.245]  Well, that ought to be the headline.
[01:27:41.285 --> 01:27:43.826]  Government caught red-handed doctoring tape.
[01:27:44.166 --> 01:27:49.288]  And then they spin it on us and release it again when it's well known it's already been on television.
[01:27:49.588 --> 01:27:51.609]  How stupid do they think we are, Paul?
[01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:53.690]  I keep calling you Paul!
[01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:54.651]  Steve Watson!
[01:27:54.671 --> 01:27:57.812]  I mean, this is getting me really, really mad.
[01:27:59.181 --> 01:28:01.403]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's like they're throwing it in our faces.
[01:28:01.503 --> 01:28:06.909]  It's like they're sort of throwing out the challenge for us to pick up on.
[01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:10.893]  It's like they know, Steve, how dumb the general public is.
[01:28:10.973 --> 01:28:13.916]  It doesn't matter what happens or what goes on.
[01:28:13.996 --> 01:28:15.678]  Bush can kiss Gannon in public.
[01:28:16.178 --> 01:28:16.899]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:16.919 --> 01:28:20.142]  They can just do whatever they want, Steve!
[01:28:21.123 --> 01:28:21.284]  Yep.
[01:28:23.186 --> 01:28:24.647]  Moving on from that, basically... Well, stay there!
[01:28:24.687 --> 01:28:25.147]  We got a break!
[01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:28.068]  I'm back with... It just keeps going and going and going!
[01:28:28.408 --> 01:28:29.868]  Did you hear what he just said?
[01:28:30.369 --> 01:28:31.369]  What Steve Watson just said?
[01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:32.649]  And Paul's got reports on this, too.
[01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:35.671]  And we're breaking this, thanks to you, the listeners, for pointing it out.
[01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:41.433]  The video, they admit, has been doctored and is used against detainees.
[01:28:43.974 --> 01:28:44.854]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:46.955]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.895 --> 01:28:50.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.991 --> 01:28:56.553]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:58.414]  A tornado under your hood!
[01:28:58.574 --> 01:29:04.357]  A tornado is an easy to install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[01:29:04.657 --> 01:29:11.741]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[01:29:11.881 --> 01:29:16.664]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[01:29:16.844 --> 01:29:22.147]  Visit tornadoair.com or pick up your tornado at Checker, Shucks and Cragen today!
[01:29:24.347 --> 01:29:28.090]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:33.113]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[01:29:33.133 --> 01:29:34.894]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[01:29:35.174 --> 01:29:35.394]  No.
[01:29:35.715 --> 01:29:39.477]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[01:29:39.877 --> 01:29:41.238]  Are all covers the same?
[01:29:41.498 --> 01:29:41.719]  No.
[01:29:41.999 --> 01:29:45.681]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:48.203]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:51.005]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:53.066]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:29:53.849 --> 01:29:56.730]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:29:57.090 --> 01:29:59.972]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:30:00.192 --> 01:30:06.374]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:30:06.774 --> 01:30:14.077]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:30:14.257 --> 01:30:18.359]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:30:18.619 --> 01:30:24.162]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:30:24.362 --> 01:30:37.468]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:41.510]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places U.S.A.
[01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:46.232]  now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at
[01:30:55.378 --> 01:30:59.481]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:30:59.721 --> 01:31:01.482]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:01.743 --> 01:31:08.027]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:08.327 --> 01:31:14.451]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.692 --> 01:31:16.553]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:31:16.793 --> 01:31:17.233]  I think so.
[01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:32.221]  We're good to go.
[01:32:01.847 --> 01:32:04.748]  Well, I won't back down.
[01:32:06.029 --> 01:32:08.890]  No, I won't back down.
[01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:25.458]  You can stand me up... Steve Watson, brother of Paul Watson, does a lot of the analysis and articles for us and web mastering over at Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:28.340]  We're going to go back to Steve in just a moment.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.640]  Go ahead and put him on hold for a minute.
[01:32:31.764 --> 01:32:39.507]  But before we go back to Steve, I want to encourage every single one of you out there to not wait.
[01:32:40.727 --> 01:32:46.569]  Documentary films that are powerfully produced with the truth are waking people up.
[01:32:46.649 --> 01:32:53.251]  We have tools that can and are being used to turn the tide.
[01:32:53.611 --> 01:33:00.074]  And Terror Storm, I think, is a very important contribution to this fight.
[01:33:00.114 --> 01:33:01.254]  The history of terror.
[01:33:01.829 --> 01:33:18.735]  From the USS Liberty to Hitler's shenanigans to the Gulf of Tonkin, right through to 9-11, the 7-7 bombings, the Madrid bombings, the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the mind control they're using, the surveillance, the torture, it's all in Terror Storm.
[01:33:20.536 --> 01:33:28.799]  The film is right under two hours long, 68 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium in L.A., 68 minutes of the best material.
[01:33:30.544 --> 01:33:35.686]  Over three hours on one DVD, 1995, available right now.
[01:33:37.947 --> 01:33:38.987]  Get to Airstorm.
[01:33:39.307 --> 01:33:41.748]  Aggressively get a DVD burner.
[01:33:41.788 --> 01:33:43.389]  You can get DVD burners that burn DVD-9s.
[01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:47.050]  Just tell them when you go to the electronics store, I want a DVD-9 burner.
[01:33:47.711 --> 01:33:49.871]  Because it's not a DVD-5, it takes a DVD-9.
[01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:53.513]  Or you can put it on your computer and compress it a bit and put it on DVD-5s.
[01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:57.773]  Please get Terror Storm and get it out to everybody.
[01:33:58.053 --> 01:34:12.723]  And yes, your meager purchase of the film also makes what we do here possible and goes back into the mission of making more films, doing more reports, getting better news and information for you, paying our people better so they can live a decent life.

[01:34:20.023 --> 01:34:27.288]  Call up and get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, my original film, remastered, re-edited, updated.
[01:34:27.308 --> 01:34:29.590]  And then a whole new film, The Order of Death, added to it.
[01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:30.230]  The Republican, uh, sicko,
[01:34:41.525 --> 01:34:47.095]  Scandal, him kissing Jeff Gannon, what they're into, what they do at the Grove, the mock child they murder.
[01:34:47.676 --> 01:34:49.380]  It's all in the new film, Order of Death.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.461]  When you get to Order of Death, you get free!
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.881]  The full length feature film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on one DVD.
[01:34:56.061 --> 01:35:01.102]  Get the new film that I'm really proud of that we're carrying and I'm proud of the work they've done.
[01:35:01.122 --> 01:35:03.902]  9-1-1 Mysteries Part 1 Demolition.
[01:35:03.922 --> 01:35:05.683]  It's just all about the demolitions of the buildings.
[01:35:06.143 --> 01:35:07.163]  This is really effective.
[01:35:07.423 --> 01:35:09.723]  They're all available at Infowars.com.
[01:35:10.263 --> 01:35:11.123]  Big discounts.
[01:35:11.443 --> 01:35:12.784]  There's a lot of specials there.
[01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:16.684]  And it's about the information but secondarily about supporting what we're doing.
[01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:18.825]  Also don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:18.965 --> 01:35:19.945]  All 15 of my films.
[01:35:20.484 --> 01:35:41.652]  My weekly TV reports, special video reports, my speeches in Chicago, L.A., the entire 9-11 Neocon Symposium, Neocon Agenda Symposium, my Dallas speeches, Jim Marr's speech, all these little special, other special reports we do, over a thousand pieces of media, all the best audio interviews from the radio show clipped out just so you can hear those.
[01:35:43.092 --> 01:35:48.014]  PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, a month.
[01:35:48.474 --> 01:35:52.716]  Membership is the cost of 2 to 3 cups of Starbucks coffee, depending on what size you get.
[01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:55.077]  And it makes what we do possible.
[01:35:55.418 --> 01:36:00.960]  And then in closing on the issue of videos, I'm not whining, I'm not complaining, it's not sour grapes.
[01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:04.302]  I busted my hind end.
[01:36:04.682 --> 01:36:09.604]  I mean, work until 2 o'clock in the morning, 6 nights a week, sometimes till 4 in the morning,
[01:36:11.025 --> 01:36:11.706]  We're good to go.
[01:36:29.521 --> 01:36:31.382]  And we were going to upload it to Google Video.
[01:36:31.402 --> 01:36:32.963]  We noticed other people had already started doing it.
[01:36:33.444 --> 01:36:34.945]  And they were bad copies.
[01:36:34.965 --> 01:36:36.746]  They weren't high res or higher res.
[01:36:37.386 --> 01:36:39.487]  So a couple of months ago I uploaded high quality versions.
[01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:40.928]  A couple of them.
[01:36:40.968 --> 01:36:42.429]  Other people have uploaded a bunch of versions.
[01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:44.450]  And I got excited!
[01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:47.753]  We got into the Top 100 briefly.
[01:36:49.814 --> 01:36:53.116]  If you added up all the different versions that were on there, it was well over 2 million.
[01:36:54.449 --> 01:36:55.849]  And it was growing exponentially.
[01:36:55.889 --> 01:36:57.710]  Most of those two million, it happened in a few days.
[01:36:57.730 --> 01:36:59.350]  It took a month for it to build up to that.
[01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:01.171]  And suddenly, Google wiped us out.
[01:37:01.771 --> 01:37:02.791]  Wiped out all our numbers.
[01:37:02.831 --> 01:37:03.612]  And why is that important?
[01:37:03.912 --> 01:37:08.473]  Most of the Google video visitors, and what is it, hundreds of millions, they said every month, watch videos on there now.
[01:37:08.513 --> 01:37:10.654]  It's bigger than all the US TV combined.
[01:37:10.694 --> 01:37:11.314]  It's huge.
[01:37:12.274 --> 01:37:13.134]  And you're in the top 100, folks.
[01:37:13.154 --> 01:37:14.895]  That's what people peruse.
[01:37:15.475 --> 01:37:17.376]  That's like getting on cable.
[01:37:17.436 --> 01:37:18.656]  It's like getting on television.
[01:37:18.676 --> 01:37:19.676]  It's like you're there now.
[01:37:19.996 --> 01:37:21.577]  You're not hidden in some recess.
[01:37:23.988 --> 01:37:26.370]  And we complained about it, and Google said, oh, it's a mistake.
[01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:28.512]  And we noticed they weren't doing it to loose change.
[01:37:28.592 --> 01:37:31.455]  And again, I figured out why I think they're not doing it to loose change.
[01:37:31.695 --> 01:37:32.836]  Loose change is already too big.
[01:37:32.876 --> 01:37:34.177]  If they do that, it'll become obvious.
[01:37:36.859 --> 01:37:41.103]  Well, actually, Google did wipe off a bunch of their earlier versions, and then they had to put up new versions.
[01:37:42.268 --> 01:37:46.331]  And then those have already gotten, I looked it up the other day, it was already like 6-7 million.
[01:37:47.011 --> 01:37:49.313]  People say 10 million downloads, that was 3 or 4 months ago.
[01:37:49.933 --> 01:37:51.734]  Loose Changes had over 30 million downloads.
[01:37:51.774 --> 01:37:52.455]  I've been watching it.
[01:37:52.515 --> 01:37:53.015]  It's awesome.
[01:37:53.035 --> 01:37:53.935]  I hope it gets a billion.
[01:37:54.136 --> 01:37:56.497]  We're not going to survive if we don't wake up and get involved.
[01:37:57.218 --> 01:37:57.558]  Okay?
[01:37:58.018 --> 01:37:58.899]  But it makes me mad!
[01:38:01.011 --> 01:38:03.292]  That I put this film out for free.
[01:38:03.432 --> 01:38:04.712]  I want to stop the terrorists.
[01:38:05.192 --> 01:38:07.313]  I think Terror Storm has a different perspective.
[01:38:07.333 --> 01:38:08.453]  They're all excellent.
[01:38:08.513 --> 01:38:09.833]  A different perspective.
[01:38:09.853 --> 01:38:11.774]  9-11 Mysteries hits one thing and just the demolitions.
[01:38:12.134 --> 01:38:15.395]  Loose Change is from a young, hip view.
[01:38:15.735 --> 01:38:16.415]  Great job.
[01:38:16.675 --> 01:38:17.255]  Great film.
[01:38:17.535 --> 01:38:18.195]  Second edition.
[01:38:18.215 --> 01:38:19.356]  You know, the first had a few mistakes.
[01:38:19.376 --> 01:38:19.976]  We all make mistakes.
[01:38:20.236 --> 01:38:21.556]  The second is just so good.
[01:38:22.436 --> 01:38:24.277]  That's why we promote that one and sell that one.
[01:38:24.337 --> 01:38:25.337]  I did in the first one.
[01:38:26.137 --> 01:38:27.518]  But I still thought they were doing a great job.
[01:38:27.558 --> 01:38:28.458]  I mean, nobody's perfect.
[01:38:28.498 --> 01:38:29.058]  I make mistakes.
[01:38:31.557 --> 01:38:35.720]  But Terror Storm really hits a wide audience.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.522]  Not just the young, but the old, the middle-aged.
[01:38:40.122 --> 01:38:43.944]  It gets the history, the war, other attacks, 7-7.
[01:38:45.005 --> 01:38:46.286]  And people are loving it.
[01:38:46.866 --> 01:38:49.047]  People are saying they're getting wake-up rates with this.
[01:38:49.087 --> 01:38:50.428]  They haven't seen it with any other film.
[01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:57.252]  And Google Video wiped about again a couple days ago, I learned.
[01:38:57.593 --> 01:38:59.774]  And it's already built back up to hundreds of thousands.
[01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:05.715]  70-something thousand on one, 80-something thousand on another, 150,000 on another, 130,000 on another.
[01:39:06.036 --> 01:39:07.477]  But still, I'm tired of that!
[01:39:08.218 --> 01:39:09.660]  I want to be in the top 100.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.362]  I want 30 million downloads six months from now.
[01:39:12.923 --> 01:39:15.065]  And I'm telling you folks, we can't let them win.
[01:39:15.125 --> 01:39:16.287]  We can't let them have their way.
[01:39:17.245 --> 01:39:22.806]  Go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, get the high quality link to the best video version of it that's out there.
[01:39:23.206 --> 01:39:28.688]  And I mean every message board, MySpace, letters to the editor.
[01:39:28.788 --> 01:39:30.668]  I want you to call in to every Patriot Talk Show.
[01:39:30.948 --> 01:39:33.509]  I want you to call in to all the mainstream talk shows and go.
[01:39:33.569 --> 01:39:36.830]  Go to Google Video, type in TerrorStorm and see the truth.
[01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:38.410]  Find out who really carried out the terror.
[01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:39.930]  TerrorStorm, TerrorStorm.
[01:39:39.971 --> 01:39:41.331]  Remember, TerrorStorm.
[01:39:41.671 --> 01:39:43.851]  Do it!
[01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:45.972]  They're afraid of this film for some reason!
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:51.362]  I don't know why in their grand calculations they're so scared of it.
[01:39:52.102 --> 01:39:53.343]  But they are scared of it!
[01:39:53.363 --> 01:39:54.803]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:39:55.164 --> 01:39:56.304]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:58.485]  Steve Watson.
[01:39:59.786 --> 01:40:01.247]  Now, recapping.
[01:40:01.387 --> 01:40:02.407]  Run through for us.
[01:40:02.427 --> 01:40:03.828]  This is such a huge story you've broken.
[01:40:04.188 --> 01:40:10.031]  Recap, you know, the basics and then let's get back into... I want to repeat that with more detail like you did in the article.
[01:40:11.312 --> 01:40:13.093]  The video that they're showing now
[01:40:14.043 --> 01:40:18.407]  ...is of the supposed hijackers admitting to everything, but there's no audio.
[01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:21.249]  They just say it shows them admitting to it, and there's no audio, and it's fake.
[01:40:21.469 --> 01:40:22.450]  Again, that's what they say.
[01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:25.252]  Here's the plane hitting the Pentagon, and they don't show you a plane.
[01:40:25.272 --> 01:40:28.234]  It's just more of the same mind control.
[01:40:29.235 --> 01:40:33.839]  It's like Americans can't recognize the semantic symbols for what they really represent.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.660]  This is so huge.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.642]  State that again for people that may have missed it.
[01:40:39.175 --> 01:41:08.142]  Well, it was released to the London Times, it was a video showing Bin Laden at a rally, giving a speech, and tagged onto it, not filmed on the same day, or necessarily in the same location, which is an important point, is the statements of Mohammed Atta and the supposed pilot of Flight 93, Zayed Jarrah, giving their last testaments, without any sound, and
[01:41:09.478 --> 01:41:17.940]  The fact that it was tagged on to the Bin Laden footage is more or less a really crude attempt to associate the two.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:26.482]  And the NBC analysis of it is really where the propaganda lies.
[01:41:26.682 --> 01:41:29.183]  I think you've got a two and a half minute clip.
[01:41:29.203 --> 01:41:30.143]  Yeah, we have several clips.
[01:41:30.163 --> 01:41:31.603]  We've got an ABC and an NBC.
[01:41:31.623 --> 01:41:34.184]  Which one do you want?
[01:41:34.284 --> 01:41:35.184]  It's the NBC.
[01:41:35.484 --> 01:41:38.305]  Okay, go ahead and roll that clip and he wants to comment on this.
[01:41:38.365 --> 01:41:38.665]  Here it is.
[01:41:39.366 --> 01:41:41.527]  NBC has obtained exclusive U.S.
[01:41:41.567 --> 01:41:42.208]  analysis.
[01:41:42.828 --> 01:41:44.830]  But why is this tape coming out now?
[01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:46.731]  And how might it have helped the U.S.
[01:41:46.751 --> 01:41:47.611]  in the war on terror?
[01:41:47.671 --> 01:41:48.772]  What is its significance?
[01:41:49.172 --> 01:41:50.373]  We're going to get to all that right now.
[01:41:50.533 --> 01:41:53.175]  NBC News has obtained an exclusive U.S.
[01:41:53.215 --> 01:41:54.316]  analysis of this tape.
[01:41:54.896 --> 01:42:02.488]  It shows ringleader Mohammed Atta recording his last will and testament, this just months before the deadly attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
[01:42:02.788 --> 01:42:05.091]  From MSNBC terrorism analyst Evan Coleman.
[01:42:05.192 --> 01:42:06.333]  Evan, a good morning to you.
[01:42:06.814 --> 01:42:08.376]  First off, where did the U.S.
[01:42:08.476 --> 01:42:09.778]  get this tape and when?
[01:42:10.399 --> 01:42:13.783]  Well, the video was recovered, actually, in Afghanistan by U.S.
[01:42:13.863 --> 01:42:17.366]  forces at approximately late 2001 or the beginning of 2002.
[01:42:18.307 --> 01:42:20.109]  It's been in the custody of the U.S.
[01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:22.291]  government since then and various different U.S.
[01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:23.212]  government agencies.
[01:42:23.792 --> 01:42:27.776]  And it's not clear exactly why it's coming out now or who provided it to the Times.
[01:42:28.537 --> 01:42:31.620]  But, you know, it is obviously a very interesting and relevant video.
[01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:34.992]  And if this tape was recovered by the U.S.
[01:42:35.052 --> 01:42:40.159]  military in 2001, why is it you think we're only learning of its existence now?
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.264]  Hey, Evan, do you think it's a mistake that this tape is out there right now?
[01:42:44.304 --> 01:42:45.626]  Was it accidentally leaked?
[01:42:45.646 --> 01:42:47.128]  Or do you think it was intentionally so?
[01:42:47.188 --> 01:42:48.850]  And if so, for what purpose?
[01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:51.151]  I doubt it was intentionally leaked.
[01:42:51.171 --> 01:42:53.252]  The video has been floating around for a while.
[01:42:53.272 --> 01:42:55.554]  I know it's in a bunch of different courts now.
[01:42:56.314 --> 01:43:03.318]  And, you know, frankly speaking, I think there may be future use for it at the upcoming military tribunals down in Guantanamo Bay.
[01:43:03.938 --> 01:43:06.620]  So I think, generally speaking, I think probably the U.S.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.102]  government would have preferred that this video remain under wraps for now.
[01:43:10.522 --> 01:43:13.283]  Now that it's out, I mean, it's a piece of history.
[01:43:13.383 --> 01:43:14.924]  It's a documentation of history.
[01:43:14.964 --> 01:43:16.005]  I think it's important that
[01:43:16.505 --> 01:43:29.453]  You know, people watch this video and understand that this is more or less conclusive proof that 9-11 was the work of Al Qaeda, it was not inspired by Al Qaeda, it was directed, it was orchestrated by Al Qaeda at the most senior levels.
[01:43:29.953 --> 01:43:32.115]  And I think this is the kind of video proof
[01:43:32.595 --> 01:43:37.220]  That is going to put a lot of 9-11 conspiracy theorists out in the cold, and for good reason.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.923]  And what do you think is the most frustrating part of this tape?
[01:43:40.123 --> 01:43:42.265]  I know, probably not having the audio, right?
[01:43:42.285 --> 01:43:43.506]  That's got to be troubling.
[01:43:43.547 --> 01:43:50.273]  Yeah, and I think that may be the very reason why this video was never released publicly by Al-Qaeda, at least until now.
[01:43:51.654 --> 01:43:54.915]  I think it was a bit embarrassing that they forgot to turn the sound on.
[01:43:54.955 --> 01:44:01.296]  And you have a Margaret and Will read by Mohammed Adda, read by Zia Jarrah, and there's simply no sound.
[01:44:01.336 --> 01:44:04.017]  And I'm sure by the time they realized that mistake, it was too late.
[01:44:04.877 --> 01:44:09.298]  It's an embarrassing mistake by Al Qaeda's multimedia folks, but it's certainly not the first.
[01:44:10.338 --> 01:44:11.678]  Okay, let me comment, Stephen.
[01:44:11.698 --> 01:44:12.618]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:44:12.638 --> 01:44:13.719]  I'm hoping to write an article about it.
[01:44:13.739 --> 01:44:14.779]  I probably already have.
[01:44:16.807 --> 01:44:18.008]  Notice he keeps going back and forth.
[01:44:18.028 --> 01:44:19.149]  That guy's a total shill.
[01:44:19.209 --> 01:44:24.152]  I mean, boy, when you hear about news stories about people being on the government payroll, that guy needs to be investigated.
[01:44:24.192 --> 01:44:25.133]  I know what I was hearing there.
[01:44:25.413 --> 01:44:26.754]  I've heard that kind of stuff before.
[01:44:27.494 --> 01:44:28.295]  Classic MO.
[01:44:29.281 --> 01:44:30.181]  of a propagandist.
[01:44:30.361 --> 01:44:32.382]  Maybe he's not, though maybe he's a good person.
[01:44:33.022 --> 01:44:41.886]  You notice he then by the end is saying Al-Qaeda released the tape again, and that they made the mistake is why they never released it until now, and then he says it's been floating around for years.
[01:44:42.126 --> 01:44:54.350]  This is the same mainstream media that said Al-Qaeda had released this back on Friday, and then he's saying this is conclusive proof that puts the conspiracy theorist out in the cold, like they said with the fat bin Laden,
[01:44:54.910 --> 01:45:01.393]  Back in 2002, then they're saying they're going to use it in the tribunals, then he says the government accidentally leaked it?
[01:45:01.493 --> 01:45:05.314]  Oh, how... Steve Watson, I mean, this is just total bull!
[01:45:06.295 --> 01:45:07.015]  Well, exactly.
[01:45:07.075 --> 01:45:09.276]  He... His name is Evan Coleman.
[01:45:09.476 --> 01:45:13.378]  He's the terror... terrorist expert for NBC.
[01:45:14.578 --> 01:45:16.839]  He contradicts himself in his own report.
[01:45:16.939 --> 01:45:20.060]  He contradicts himself several times within two minutes.
[01:45:20.601 --> 01:45:23.802]  He says that the US had recovered this video
[01:45:24.554 --> 01:45:30.858]  In late 2001, early 2002, and then it's been floating around several different intelligence agencies.
[01:45:31.498 --> 01:45:36.521]  And then he goes on to say that he's still toeing the line that Al-Qaeda's released this video this week.
[01:45:36.541 --> 01:45:39.923]  I know, but it doesn't matter to a general public, it's totally brain dead!
[01:45:41.043 --> 01:45:41.523]  Well, exactly.
[01:45:41.543 --> 01:45:47.827]  I mean, any... How you can watch this report and not realize that that just doesn't add up, I just...
[01:45:48.573 --> 01:45:49.554]  It's just baffling.
[01:45:49.614 --> 01:45:51.595]  It's the most pathetic piece of journalism.
[01:45:51.775 --> 01:45:54.336]  Well, yes, Steve, we've been put out in the cold, though, now.
[01:45:54.396 --> 01:45:55.417]  It's over for us.
[01:45:56.358 --> 01:45:56.958]  Well, exactly.
[01:45:56.978 --> 01:46:01.821]  I mean, that is basically a direct attack on the 9-11 Truth Movement, isn't it?
[01:46:01.861 --> 01:46:05.903]  Saying conspiracy theorists have been put out in the cold for good reason.
[01:46:07.524 --> 01:46:11.826]  I mean, we have not been put out in the cold by this.
[01:46:11.886 --> 01:46:14.388]  We've been given heat by this, because it's such a shoddy job.
[01:46:15.209 --> 01:46:15.769]  Exactly.
[01:46:15.789 --> 01:46:16.409]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:46:16.449 --> 01:46:24.551]  I think the arrogant intelligence agents and people in government are fighting the war of 20, 30 years ago when they were the only ones putting baloney out.
[01:46:25.111 --> 01:46:27.351]  Okay, now they're not getting away with it.
[01:46:27.732 --> 01:46:29.872]  And every time they attack us, we just get stronger.
[01:46:30.292 --> 01:46:37.013]  And I just don't think these little arrogant cusses have figured it out yet, Steve, that we are cleaning their terrorist clocks.
[01:46:38.574 --> 01:46:39.474]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:46:40.374 --> 01:46:44.675]  With stuff like that to work with, it's not very hard either.
[01:46:45.467 --> 01:46:49.050]  Well, but there's those of us that are informed and involved and seeking for the truth.
[01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:58.557]  They're playing to an audience that just can't find Afghanistan on a map, doesn't know who the Vice President is, and thinks gun control and open borders is conservative.
[01:46:59.358 --> 01:47:15.182]  So, again, we've got to remember that, for those of us that are somewhat informed, I don't claim to be a genius, you don't either, it's just common sense, that this seems asinine and just ridiculous cockamamie boulderdash, but to some, they believe it.
[01:47:15.642 --> 01:47:18.062]  But, I want to recap, this is key.
[01:47:19.223 --> 01:47:20.443]  In this documentary,
[01:47:21.572 --> 01:47:25.114]  The Road to Guantanamo, which I've watched, by the way.
[01:47:25.934 --> 01:47:28.395]  When this all came up ago, I remember that footage.
[01:47:28.415 --> 01:47:29.716]  Again, hidden in plain view.
[01:47:30.656 --> 01:47:31.717]  I didn't make all the connections.
[01:47:31.777 --> 01:47:32.357]  A listener did.
[01:47:32.717 --> 01:47:33.237]  He did this.
[01:47:33.758 --> 01:47:34.918]  That's why you help us, folks.
[01:47:34.938 --> 01:47:40.060]  That's why I've tried to read, tried to scan through with my wife, 500 emails this morning.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.181]  I literally have like a hundred printed out.
[01:47:42.481 --> 01:47:43.642]  I'd love to read them all on air.
[01:47:43.662 --> 01:47:44.422]  They're all excellent.
[01:47:46.303 --> 01:47:48.004]  I have other staff trying to read all these.
[01:47:48.044 --> 01:47:50.665]  Just keep them coming, though, because you're the folks that point all this out.
[01:47:51.269 --> 01:47:52.389]  And we did go and confirm it.
[01:47:52.409 --> 01:47:53.270]  You did help Steve.
[01:47:53.710 --> 01:47:58.092]  Understand... Go over that again, Paul, Steve, and elaborate on it.
[01:47:58.112 --> 01:47:59.772]  I know Paul's written another article on this today.
[01:47:59.952 --> 01:48:00.813]  But Steve, go over this.
[01:48:02.373 --> 01:48:10.297]  Well, yeah, the docudrama Road to Guantanamo follows three British inmates who were detained and were later proven to be totally innocent.
[01:48:11.417 --> 01:48:18.380]  And the context of it is they're showing the tape as an intelligence surveillance tape to the DCADs
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.644]  And they've edited in their appearances.
[01:48:22.426 --> 01:48:27.235]  They've doctored the footage to make it appear that they are, they were there.
[01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:30.432]  At this rally in Afghanistan in January 2000.
[01:48:30.992 --> 01:48:37.496]  Now there's a documentary how the government's using this edited footage to trick people into confessing.
[01:48:37.516 --> 01:48:41.799]  So on national television, international, it's an admittedly fake Dr. Tate.
[01:48:42.139 --> 01:48:47.122]  Now it's on television and they're announcing Al-Qaeda's released it.
[01:48:47.462 --> 01:48:49.343]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:48:49.363 --> 01:48:55.007]  Yeah, and then NBC comes out and basically does exactly the same thing.
[01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:56.928]  Shows a crowd of people
[01:48:57.843 --> 01:49:04.742]  Pauses on a face and the analysis is this this might be Mohammed Atta in the crowd and
[01:49:05.425 --> 01:49:07.566]  It's basically exactly the same as it is in the Gump video.
[01:49:07.586 --> 01:49:19.110]  And then they cut to this jumpy video that has the same look as when Forrest Gump shakes hands with Kennedy, not real, or the stuff where Steve McQueen last year pitching Mustangs, 20 plus years in the grave.
[01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:22.171]  It's hard to mimic the real movement of a face.
[01:49:22.311 --> 01:49:25.392]  It can look like it, but there's still a jumpiness, still a plasticky look.
[01:49:25.812 --> 01:49:28.813]  This video looks totally fake to begin with, Steve.
[01:49:29.747 --> 01:49:34.449]  Yeah, I mean, you have to go, you have to basically go to the Times website and watch the unedited clip.
[01:49:34.809 --> 01:49:36.009]  It lasts 50 minutes.
[01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:38.990]  Yeah, I've gone and watched them.
[01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:40.331]  It's as fake as the day is long.
[01:49:40.351 --> 01:49:42.031]  But we've proven it's fake from every other angle.
[01:49:42.971 --> 01:49:43.592]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:43.652 --> 01:49:47.813]  Steve Watson, the brother of Paul Watson, joins us.
[01:49:47.913 --> 01:49:48.693]  Great analysis.
[01:49:49.173 --> 01:49:50.554]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:49:56.642 --> 01:49:59.824]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.185 --> 01:50:02.086]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.486 --> 01:50:10.152]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.832 --> 01:50:17.877]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.277 --> 01:50:25.142]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:29.714]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.994 --> 01:50:33.515]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.975 --> 01:50:35.856]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.216 --> 01:50:40.117]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:55.106 --> 01:50:56.146]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:50:56.466 --> 01:50:59.247]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:50:59.507 --> 01:51:03.668]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.

[01:52:49.458 --> 01:52:52.081]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:52:54.945 --> 01:53:10.403]  We've got Chris Floyd, maybe I'll call him Paul Floyd, joining us, writes for a bunch of big international newspapers with his great analysis of the Constitution Killing Enabling Act, signed, well, coming up
[01:53:11.411 --> 01:53:12.872]  In a few days, it'll be a week ago.
[01:53:13.392 --> 01:53:16.153]  This is just outrageous to have this happening.
[01:53:16.173 --> 01:53:18.313]  I'm going to keep Steve Watson with us.
[01:53:18.954 --> 01:53:25.776]  I've had his brother probably on 75 times in the last four years, so I'm so accustomed to saying Paul Watson when I hear that English voice.
[01:53:25.916 --> 01:53:26.496]  Steve Watson.
[01:53:26.956 --> 01:53:28.217]  They sound so much alike that...
[01:53:29.401 --> 01:53:32.103]  Scott, when he called him up in England to get him on the show, said, that sounds like Paul.
[01:53:32.463 --> 01:53:33.484]  But it is Steve Watson.
[01:53:33.764 --> 01:53:36.506]  You see a lot of his great work on InfoWars.net.
[01:53:36.707 --> 01:53:38.328]  That's the main site that he runs.
[01:53:38.548 --> 01:53:43.091]  But he also contributes to PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:45.033 --> 01:53:47.115]  Steve, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:53:47.155 --> 01:53:56.882]  But before we do that, any other little tidbits or caveats or addendums or supplementals that you would like to add to your wonderful analysis of this fraud?
[01:53:57.802 --> 01:54:16.415]  Yeah, well I've written another article today which is now up on all the websites, basically highlighting the fact that the tape was released to the London Times, but that was a total smokescreen because the journalist, UC Fowler, is the guy who works for Al Jazeera in London.
[01:54:16.695 --> 01:54:18.136]  He also works for the Times.
[01:54:18.156 --> 01:54:22.399]  So basically, he gets all the videos all the time anyway.
[01:54:22.839 --> 01:54:27.502]  So the fact that it was put in the London Times and not Al Jazeera is a total smokescreen.
[01:54:28.308 --> 01:54:35.650]  And basically, the videos are provided to him, all the evidence points, by a company called Intel Center.
[01:54:36.330 --> 01:54:36.610]  Yes.
[01:54:37.891 --> 01:54:49.674]  And basically, whenever an Al-Qaeda tape is released, it goes onto their website, intelcenter.com, which you can go and look at, and it goes on immediately, and it's immediately for sale.
[01:54:50.714 --> 01:54:56.356]  And they've even predicted before when they're going to get one, before it's actually released, as they did with
[01:54:56.827 --> 01:54:58.328]  Mm-hmm, wonder who they are!
[01:54:59.189 --> 01:55:02.831]  The London Bomber Tape, um, the second London Bomber Tape.
[01:55:03.332 --> 01:55:07.394]  But basically, Intel Center's run by a guy called Ben Venk.
[01:55:08.535 --> 01:55:18.062]  And if you do a simple Google search on his name, you realize that he used to be the director of an intelligence company called iDefense.
[01:55:19.302 --> 01:55:25.967]  Uh, which is basically made up of several ex-military officials, long-serving ex-military.
[01:55:26.494 --> 01:55:33.698]  It's directly tied into... And it's in Virginia, and it's yellow and it quacks, and it's got little pink feet.
[01:55:34.478 --> 01:55:36.179]  But it's not a duck, Steve.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:38.801]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:38.841 --> 01:55:46.005]  And basically, I mean, the director of eye defense is called Jim Melnick, and this is on their own website.
[01:55:46.025 --> 01:55:47.665]  He worked 16 years in the U.S.
[01:55:47.705 --> 01:55:50.047]  military in psychological operations.
[01:55:50.287 --> 01:55:51.287]  Well, don't worry.
[01:55:51.568 --> 01:55:53.449]  So what if there's psychological operations?
[01:55:53.469 --> 01:55:54.049]  This is good.
[01:55:54.736 --> 01:55:56.437]  You can trust all these tapes, Steve.
[01:55:56.477 --> 01:55:57.198]  It's all real.
[01:55:57.498 --> 01:55:59.299]  We've been thoroughly discredited yet again.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.883]  Basically, he was assigned directly to the office of, guess who?
[01:56:05.143 --> 01:56:06.404]  Donald Rumsfeld!
[01:56:06.464 --> 01:56:07.665]  Donald Rumsfeld!
[01:56:07.705 --> 01:56:12.068]  The videos are coming from Don Rumsfeld's deputy.
[01:56:12.849 --> 01:56:16.811]  I think you said yesterday on the show that he keeps popping up like the devil.
[01:56:17.092 --> 01:56:17.812]  He's everywhere.
[01:56:17.852 --> 01:56:18.973]  He's connected to everything.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:23.863]  But it takes about five minutes to connect him to where these tapes are coming from.
[01:56:23.943 --> 01:56:26.525]  It takes five minutes to connect him to everything on Earth that's bad.
[01:56:26.545 --> 01:56:27.766]  I mean, I'm serious, folks.
[01:56:28.346 --> 01:56:34.831]  Every time I finally get to the final deep crevice of the rat hole, it's Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:56:36.932 --> 01:56:38.013]  He literally is a demon.
[01:56:38.053 --> 01:56:43.077]  I mean, the guy... Sorry, folks, I'm... I just... Steve, when is it going to end?
[01:56:43.497 --> 01:56:47.940]  When is... I mean, just how... How incredible does it have to get before people wake up?
[01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:50.823]  Well, I don't know.
[01:56:51.024 --> 01:56:52.284]  I don't know what's going to happen next.
[01:56:52.384 --> 01:56:57.387]  I mean, to me, this is the most ridiculous tape that's been released.
[01:56:57.808 --> 01:56:59.449]  You can see through it from a mile off.
[01:57:00.549 --> 01:57:01.530]  Every angle!
[01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:04.091]  No matter how you look at it, it's a fraud.
[01:57:04.292 --> 01:57:06.173]  It's not like we're trying to go prove it a fraud, folks.
[01:57:06.233 --> 01:57:07.674]  It's a joke fraud.
[01:57:07.694 --> 01:57:11.456]  I mean, all you have to do is pay some attention to it.
[01:57:12.068 --> 01:57:15.431]  And I think it's the fact that a lot of people don't pay any attention to it.
[01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:17.572]  Yeah, it's just all that new Bin Laden tape.
[01:57:17.752 --> 01:57:19.053]  They're on... I've had people email me.
[01:57:19.254 --> 01:57:21.715]  They're on TV admitting they did it, Alex!
[01:57:22.776 --> 01:57:25.178]  They're on television admitting it, Alex.
[01:57:25.198 --> 01:57:26.139]  What's wrong with you?
[01:57:26.579 --> 01:57:30.662]  I'm gonna give all my rights up so Muhammad Abba doesn't get me.
[01:57:30.982 --> 01:57:31.823]  We'll take a couple calls.
[01:57:31.863 --> 01:57:32.363]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.344 --> 01:57:38.248]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:50.536]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.237]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.978 --> 01:57:54.078]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.739 --> 01:57:55.539]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.200]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:01.583]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.063 --> 01:58:06.165]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.906 --> 01:58:08.827]  Well, I gotta tell ya...
[01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:19.815]  My whole crew keeps knocking them out of the park, and Steve Watson set a grand slam here, proving from every angle that this new footage of the supposed hijackers taking credit is a fraud.
[01:58:20.115 --> 01:58:24.537]  Well, there's a statement that it's them admitting to it, has no audio, there's nothing, that's a fraud.
[01:58:24.577 --> 01:58:29.339]  Then it links back to one of Donald Rumsfeld's deputies, the people that are always putting it out.
[01:58:30.419 --> 01:58:38.563]  It's just, it's been out for a year or so, in this docudrama on television, admitted, edited, fake government footage.
[01:58:39.824 --> 01:58:40.864]  It's insane.
[01:58:40.884 --> 01:58:43.525]  Let's talk to Deanne in Illinois and Chris in Canada.
[01:58:43.566 --> 01:58:44.346]  Go ahead, Deanne.
[01:58:44.366 --> 01:58:46.547]  You're on the air with Steve Watson.
[01:58:47.327 --> 01:58:48.708]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:48.808 --> 01:58:52.109]  I'm sorry you came out here.
[01:58:52.169 --> 01:58:53.369]  I'm sorry I missed you.
[01:58:53.449 --> 01:58:55.550]  I'm a radio host as well.
[01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:56.751]  Well, don't be so sorry.
[01:58:56.771 --> 01:58:58.531]  I am.
[01:58:58.591 --> 01:59:02.613]  I'm sorry because you've been doing an excellent job and I commend you.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.441]  I'm sorry, Alex, I was trying to talk to your host and I got Alex in my mind.
[01:59:08.801 --> 01:59:13.302]  That's okay, my name's Alex and you're talking to Steve.
[01:59:13.342 --> 01:59:14.803]  He likes to be called Stevie though.
[01:59:14.963 --> 01:59:16.103]  Yeah, I'm getting flustered.
[01:59:17.103 --> 01:59:31.046]  So anyway, what I want to say about Muhammad Atta, I was in a business in Palos Heights, Illinois, where in 2000, Atta called into my business because there was a flight school.
[01:59:31.839 --> 01:59:36.421]  There, within my business, that I reported to the FBI and they did absolutely nothing.
[01:59:36.981 --> 01:59:50.665]  And I'm under the impression from what I've done and looking into different things and I do a lot of background checking and investigation that this man is still alive and it was just totally a hoax.
[01:59:50.765 --> 02:00:00.549]  The 9-11 issue had to do with insurance fraud, manipulation of money through real estate and everything else tied right back into this government and CIA.
[02:00:01.462 --> 02:00:03.543]  There were operatives that I've talked to.
[02:00:03.603 --> 02:00:06.864]  They have told me that they use various names like Mohammed.
[02:00:07.684 --> 02:00:19.328]  That was like a code word for these ops to go and perpetrate these criminal activities so that we would point... Well, we know that everybody else was trained in every type of spy training under the sun.
[02:00:19.688 --> 02:00:20.889]  They're total government agents.
[02:00:20.909 --> 02:00:21.769]  There's no debating that.
[02:00:22.169 --> 02:00:23.950]  Yeah, and it's a nightmare.
[02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.650]  But the thing is,
[02:00:25.089 --> 02:00:28.173]  I just want to ask both of you for the listening audience.
[02:00:28.273 --> 02:00:31.256]  I put together a petition.
[02:00:31.677 --> 02:00:36.963]  One is by Alfred Weber, which is for treason against George Bush's White House.
[02:00:37.003 --> 02:00:43.290]  And the other one is I'm trying to get the low-end government officials that are okaying and allowing these things from each state.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.343]  To be impeached and removed out of government offices.
[02:00:47.523 --> 02:00:49.104]  Okay, is there a website or something?
[02:00:49.364 --> 02:00:51.626]  Yeah, I'm putting it together.
[02:00:51.666 --> 02:01:02.014]  You can call on my site, which is d-a-n-n-e-s-g-u-s-t-dot-c-o-n-dot-n-r, and I will be putting that up tomorrow.
[02:01:02.234 --> 02:01:03.075]  Okay, great.
[02:01:03.275 --> 02:01:04.836]  I've actually heard your radio show.
[02:01:05.077 --> 02:01:10.541]  You've called in a couple times, too, and you're wonderful, and you're going to support everything you're doing.
[02:01:10.581 --> 02:01:11.942]  We've got to collectively work
[02:01:12.503 --> 02:01:14.284]  On this, and I think you're doing a wonderful job.
[02:01:14.304 --> 02:01:15.184]  Good, well you are too.
[02:01:15.404 --> 02:01:16.065]  Good to hear from you.
[02:01:16.085 --> 02:01:18.706]  Let's take one call here from Chris in Canada.
[02:01:18.786 --> 02:01:19.506]  Welcome, Chris.
[02:01:20.086 --> 02:01:21.607]  Hey, thanks for what you're doing.
[02:01:21.627 --> 02:01:33.552]  You know, what puzzles me is, like, since I figured this out, or this became clear to me, everything about 9-11, etc., I just can't stop spreading the word.
[02:01:34.492 --> 02:01:40.175]  And when someone that I speak to finally does see the facts and their mind is changed, nobody really cares.
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:44.401]  It's like, I've never found anybody who gets really lit up by this.
[02:01:44.821 --> 02:01:45.921]  Oh, well you found me, buddy.
[02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:47.242]  I found you, yeah.
[02:01:47.302 --> 02:01:48.842]  Steve gets lit up, don't you, Steve?
[02:01:50.182 --> 02:02:03.546]  Yeah, well I've found now that I don't need, well I still go to people, but now more so, especially this year, people are now coming to me, people that I know, that I haven't, you know, I've sown seeds with them before, but they're now coming to me to find out more.
[02:02:03.966 --> 02:02:10.528]  I think all you've got to do really is keep sowing the seed, and as more information comes out, people will start coming to you for more.
[02:02:12.241 --> 02:02:20.265]  And before you let me go, I just wanted to, um, to... About your getting your videos out... Well, stay there, stay there, because we got Chris Floyd, an amazing writer and researcher, coming up.
[02:02:20.285 --> 02:02:21.886]  But I'll keep you both two minutes on the other side.
[02:02:21.906 --> 02:02:22.687]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:22.747 --> 02:02:24.428]  I know Steve has a hot date tonight.
[02:02:24.448 --> 02:02:25.128]  We gotta let him go.
[02:02:25.188 --> 02:02:26.168]  It's nighttime over there.
[02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:30.010]  And, uh... Oh, it's true.
[02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:30.751]  That's what you told me.
[02:02:31.211 --> 02:02:39.495]  And then, uh, we're gonna go to break, and we're gonna come back, and, uh... We're going to, uh, have Chris, uh, Floyd on with us.
[02:02:39.515 --> 02:02:40.556]  But, but, but, stay there.
[02:02:41.596 --> 02:02:42.397]  Caller, you stay there too.
[02:02:42.417 --> 02:02:44.038]  I'm going to let you both finish up on the other side.
[02:02:44.979 --> 02:02:51.924]  It's here, after a year in production, traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.284 --> 02:02:54.206]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.566 --> 02:03:02.192]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.918 --> 02:03:09.939]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.339 --> 02:03:21.761]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.081 --> 02:03:25.602]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.062 --> 02:03:27.982]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.302 --> 02:03:32.083]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.535 --> 02:03:47.376]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:03:47.716 --> 02:03:49.237]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:03:49.657 --> 02:03:49.897]  What?
[02:03:50.258 --> 02:03:50.618]  Again?
[02:03:51.038 --> 02:03:52.659]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:03:52.739 --> 02:03:57.161]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:03:57.381 --> 02:03:58.682]  Why did you do that?
[02:03:58.882 --> 02:04:04.685]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:04:04.985 --> 02:04:06.006]  Are we there yet?
[02:04:06.126 --> 02:04:07.186]  for the entire trip.
[02:04:07.427 --> 02:04:09.628]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:04:10.108 --> 02:04:11.128]  Great idea.
[02:04:11.409 --> 02:04:13.950]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:04:14.358 --> 02:04:16.823]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:04:17.023 --> 02:04:21.412]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:04:21.692 --> 02:04:22.013]  Honey!
[02:04:22.816 --> 02:04:24.056]  You're terrific!
[02:04:24.476 --> 02:04:25.957]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:04:26.057 --> 02:04:29.458]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:04:29.738 --> 02:04:30.518]  Now can we stop?
[02:04:31.038 --> 02:04:31.758]  I need to go, too.
[02:04:32.058 --> 02:04:36.519]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.579 --> 02:04:36.859]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.919 --> 02:04:38.480]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.091 --> 02:04:46.733]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[02:04:47.033 --> 02:04:54.423]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[02:04:54.583 --> 02:05:02.372]  With stabilized allicins, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[02:05:02.572 --> 02:05:03.654]  And there's no odor.
[02:05:03.894 --> 02:05:13.900]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:22.205]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[02:05:22.465 --> 02:05:28.048]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[02:05:28.504 --> 02:05:37.147]  Visit truthandexcellence.com, click the Truth and Excellence banner on GCNlive.com, or call me, Amy Bjorkman, personally at 805-595-2711.
[02:05:37.167 --> 02:05:37.207]  805-595-2711.
[02:05:37.227 --> 02:05:40.728]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:03.696 --> 02:06:20.289]  We're going to read just a few paragraphs of that in a moment and go to Chris Floyd, who I've been a big fan of for years.
[02:06:20.789 --> 02:06:23.651]  Briefly met him at the Project Sensory Award back in 2004.
[02:06:24.392 --> 02:06:29.696]  He joins us from Oxford, England, though he is an American and has a huge bio here.
[02:06:29.716 --> 02:06:32.218]  I won't even attempt to go over it, but briefly finishing up with Steve.
[02:06:32.845 --> 02:06:39.392]  Watson, also joining us from England, and he is an Englander, and we were talking to Chris in Canada.
[02:06:39.432 --> 02:06:42.976]  Chris, you had one more point you wanted to make to Steve Watson.
[02:06:42.996 --> 02:06:43.336]  Go ahead.
[02:06:43.356 --> 02:06:45.438]  Actually, this is just for you, Alex.
[02:06:45.498 --> 02:06:50.944]  As far as getting your videos out into Canada, because we need them here, and you were saying that you're having difficulty getting them across customs.
[02:06:52.029 --> 02:06:55.373]  I can get videos into Russia, China, anywhere in South Africa.
[02:06:56.173 --> 02:06:57.915]  Canada is like Nazi Germany.
[02:06:58.316 --> 02:06:59.417]  It was hard for me to fly in.
[02:06:59.457 --> 02:07:02.580]  I was detained for 15 hours last time I flew in there.
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:03.781]  Yeah, I know.
[02:07:06.484 --> 02:07:10.588]  Why not have somebody in Canada and just have them distributed from Canada?
[02:07:11.972 --> 02:07:13.133]  We've heard a lot of that.
[02:07:13.573 --> 02:07:18.175]  A lot of people have said that, and we're probably going to end up having to do that, and I appreciate your call.
[02:07:18.235 --> 02:07:18.835]  God bless you.
[02:07:19.516 --> 02:07:22.217]  Steve Watson, in closing, you have written two huge articles.
[02:07:22.237 --> 02:07:23.177]  Your brother's written two.
[02:07:23.658 --> 02:07:32.462]  This new development, Tracking Back the Fake Hijacker Tape, was released last week to a former deputy of Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:07:32.542 --> 02:07:38.745]  This is massive, and the fact that the very video was shown two years ago, or a year ago, in a docudrama
[02:07:40.446 --> 02:07:44.968]  We have caught them with their pants completely down, Steve, and you have knocked it out of the park.
[02:07:45.108 --> 02:07:45.748]  Final statement?
[02:07:47.269 --> 02:07:55.332]  Well, yeah, just to say that, I mean, things like this tape, as they've shown, they don't need to make them complex or, you know, sophisticated.
[02:07:55.372 --> 02:07:56.633]  They just throw them out there.
[02:07:57.433 --> 02:08:06.097]  And it's really like they're firing cannonballs off a warship, and we've just got to just counter-strike and strike back, because
[02:08:07.503 --> 02:08:08.864]  They don't need to be sophisticated.
[02:08:08.884 --> 02:08:15.327]  They're just using them as distractions from, as we've seen from basically the destruction of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[02:08:15.727 --> 02:08:18.869]  Well, that is one of their strong points, is it is just mindless lies.
[02:08:18.929 --> 02:08:20.189]  In fact, they make them stupid.
[02:08:20.369 --> 02:08:22.130]  We killed Zarqawi twelve times!
[02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:25.512]  You know, we killed... I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:08:25.572 --> 02:08:26.872]  How dumb do they think we are?
[02:08:26.892 --> 02:08:28.533]  I don't know.
[02:08:28.553 --> 02:08:35.977]  Maybe they think we'll just get so bored of how dumb they are that we'll stop trying to counter-strike, but we're not going to.
[02:08:36.821 --> 02:08:37.061]  No, no.
[02:08:37.081 --> 02:08:38.462]  We're having a lot of success right now.
[02:08:38.522 --> 02:08:39.502]  You keep it up, my friend.
[02:08:39.542 --> 02:08:39.882]  Take care.
[02:08:39.902 --> 02:08:41.042]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:08:41.562 --> 02:08:41.803]  You bet.
[02:08:41.843 --> 02:08:43.523]  There goes Steve Watson.
[02:08:44.323 --> 02:08:45.864]  Always great to have him with us.
[02:08:46.004 --> 02:08:48.084]  Okay, let me just read a few paragraphs of this and we'll go to our guest.
[02:08:48.665 --> 02:08:51.606]  Fatal Vision, the Deeper Evil Behind the Detainee Bill.
[02:08:52.146 --> 02:08:57.687]  And Chris Floyd has written for international newspapers in England, Russia, the U.S.
[02:08:57.727 --> 02:08:58.268]  He writes.
[02:08:58.428 --> 02:08:59.728]  His stuff gets posted everywhere.
[02:08:59.748 --> 02:09:00.508]  He's very prolific.
[02:09:01.128 --> 02:09:03.009]  I probably don't have to introduce him to this audience.
[02:09:03.409 --> 02:09:06.270]  Fatal Vision, the Deeper Evil Behind the Detainee Bill.
[02:09:08.175 --> 02:09:27.652]  And it begins, it was a dark hour indeed last Thursday when the United States Senate voted to end the Constitutional Republic and transform the country into a leader state, giving the President and his agents the power to capture, torture, and imprison forever anyone, American citizens included, whom they arbitrarily decided is an enemy combatant.
[02:09:27.672 --> 02:09:31.836]  This also includes those who merely give terrorism some kind of support
[02:09:32.771 --> 02:09:41.036]  Defined so vaguely that many experts say it could encompass legal advice, innocent gifts to charities, or even political opposition to U.S.
[02:09:41.076 --> 02:09:43.757]  government policy within its draconian structures.
[02:09:44.417 --> 02:09:51.561]  And I read most of the bill, most of the sections on enemy combatant designations, or alien and enemy combatant designations.
[02:09:52.882 --> 02:10:00.726]  Not giving total allegiance to Bush, damaging property, trespassing, seizing something that isn't yours.
[02:10:00.886 --> 02:10:02.127]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:10:03.101 --> 02:10:14.492]  All of this is bad enough, a sickening and cowardly surrender of liberty not seen in a major western democracy since the Enabling Act passed by a German Reichstag in March of 33, a month after Hitler firebombed it, I would add.
[02:10:14.732 --> 02:10:18.335]  But it is by no means the full extent of our degradation.
[02:10:18.355 --> 02:10:22.980]  In reality, the darkness is deeper and more foul than most people imagine.
[02:10:23.502 --> 02:10:46.793]  For in addition to the dictatorial powers of seizure and torment given by Congress on Thursday to George W. Bush, powers he had already seized and exercised for five years anyway, even without this fig leaf of sham legality, there is a far more sinister imperial right that Bush has claimed and used openly without any demur or debate from Congress at all, ordering the extra
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:58.544]  Judicial killing of anyone on earth that he and his deputies decide arbitrarily, without charges, court hearing, formal evidence, or appeal, it is an enemy combatant.
[02:10:59.324 --> 02:11:02.985]  And the article goes on for ten pages jam-packed.
[02:11:03.045 --> 02:11:06.926]  I mean, you want to really learn what they're doing, you go read this.
[02:11:07.967 --> 02:11:13.748]  And we don't have time to read all of it, but we are honored again to have Chris Floyd with us.
[02:11:14.129 --> 02:11:15.289]  Thank you, sir, for joining us.
[02:11:15.785 --> 02:11:16.765]  Well, thank you Alex.
[02:11:16.845 --> 02:11:23.007]  The article sure sounds better when you read it, I must say.
[02:11:23.587 --> 02:11:25.208]  First, tell us a little bit about Chris Floyd.
[02:11:25.228 --> 02:11:27.469]  This is your maiden visit with us.
[02:11:27.489 --> 02:11:34.151]  You've been chronicling this and, unfortunately, tolling the bell that all this would happen.
[02:11:34.431 --> 02:11:38.672]  Your analysis has been in the top ten I've seen out there.
[02:11:38.712 --> 02:11:40.493]  Unfortunately, you're spot on yet again.
[02:11:41.793 --> 02:11:46.635]  Tell us about yourself and break down what's really happening for us and what you see happening in the future.
[02:11:47.776 --> 02:11:50.777]  Well, Alex, like you said, I'm an American.
[02:11:50.877 --> 02:11:51.978]  I do live in England at the moment.
[02:11:52.818 --> 02:11:53.499]  But I'm an American.
[02:11:53.539 --> 02:11:57.661]  I worked over in the Moscow Times for many years and that's where I really started writing about Bush.
[02:11:57.761 --> 02:12:00.022]  I had a column for the Moscow Times for about 11 years.
[02:12:00.722 --> 02:12:04.224]  And I began writing about this power grab of George Bush.
[02:12:04.324 --> 02:12:09.206]  Actually, my first article about Bush's power grab, imperial power grab, was September 19, 2001.
[02:12:11.294 --> 02:12:19.717]  You know, I mean, from the very first day we've been writing about this, I've been writing about this extrajudicial killing program since November the 2nd, 2001.
[02:12:20.297 --> 02:12:36.362]  And as I pointed out, I don't know if I pointed out in this article, I've pointed out elsewhere, all these facts, as you said, it's a long article and it's full of facts, all these facts about these extrajudicial powers, unconstitutional powers, these tyrannical powers that Bush has seized over the years, all these facts,
[02:12:36.897 --> 02:12:37.957]  Or in the mainstream press.
[02:12:37.997 --> 02:12:39.778]  I didn't get them from any inside whistleblower.
[02:12:39.798 --> 02:12:41.878]  You know, I didn't have Daniel Ellsberg come around and tell me about it.
[02:12:42.218 --> 02:12:45.118]  You just read it in the paper, where they brag about it, where they talk openly about it.
[02:12:45.138 --> 02:12:51.540]  Especially in the early days, when they were, you know, when Cheney was going on television saying, yeah, we're going to the dark side, and saying it openly.
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:53.800]  You know, now they've pulled back from that a little bit.
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:54.980]  But it's all out there in the open.
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:56.961]  All this information is out there for anyone to see.
[02:12:56.981 --> 02:12:59.901]  And as I say, it's been going on for about five years.
[02:12:59.961 --> 02:13:05.082]  And so, to me, in some ways, what happened last Thursday, and I know it is to you too,
[02:13:05.598 --> 02:13:10.119]  I mean, it was horrible, it was heartbreaking, but it really wasn't a surprise, was it?
[02:13:10.139 --> 02:13:25.904]  To see the Congress vocal like that, to see the Democrats not even... No, it wasn't, but still, when it happened, everybody I've talked to said it was still... Like, we didn't think we'd be staggered by it, but everybody I've talked to, including Ed Asner yesterday, said that it was literally like I lost something.
[02:13:25.944 --> 02:13:28.084]  I'm like, my God, everything we said about them is true.
[02:13:28.464 --> 02:13:29.465]  They really did it.
[02:13:30.085 --> 02:13:33.626]  Still, even though we knew it was going to happen, to see them do it... Oh, yeah.
[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:36.181]  Well, it's like in any other situation.
[02:13:36.201 --> 02:13:40.722]  When you're there and you're expecting the worst, say you have some fatal illness, or you suspect you have a fatal illness, right?
[02:13:41.142 --> 02:13:42.823]  And you prepare for it, and you think, well, it's probably the worst.
[02:13:43.103 --> 02:13:46.264]  But when the doctor finally tells you, you know, that's it, man, you're going.
[02:13:47.084 --> 02:13:50.285]  It's a big shock, no matter how much you prepared for it, how much you think it's going to happen.
[02:13:50.305 --> 02:13:52.026]  That's what's happened here.
[02:13:52.206 --> 02:13:56.828]  You've been writing about it, and talking about it, and filming about it, and I've been writing about it for five years now.
[02:13:59.394 --> 02:14:09.963]  And I guess there was an element, especially in the early years when I wrote about it, you know, it was an element of this is what could happen, you know, this is what's coming, this could happen if, you know, if it's followed to its logical conclusion, this is what could happen.
[02:14:09.983 --> 02:14:13.405]  Sort of a prophylactic kind of thing, you know, trying to warn people.
[02:14:13.906 --> 02:14:16.608]  But then it turned out to be just, it has happened, you know.
[02:14:16.788 --> 02:14:24.294]  That's like saying the Redcoats are going to land, we say it for years, and finally the ships are landing, the troops are disembarking, it's here!
[02:14:24.794 --> 02:14:25.635]  Yeah, I know, it's here.
[02:14:25.675 --> 02:14:26.996]  Well, I mean, there's nothing to
[02:14:27.688 --> 02:14:47.253]  Once it's been approved this way, I guess at some point, in some ways, as long as it was all hidden, as long as we could see it happening and Bush was claiming his powers in secret with executive orders, but I mean, this is really, yes, I've used this expression myself many times, crossing the Rubicon, each time we think this is it, but this is it.
[02:14:47.273 --> 02:14:56.436]  I mean, when the Congress comes out and embraces this unitary executive theory, embraces torture, embraces this ability of the President to, you know,
[02:14:56.969 --> 02:15:00.111]  As you were talking about, this enemy combatant designation is just wide open.
[02:15:00.171 --> 02:15:02.152]  It could be anybody they want to, for anything they want to.
[02:15:02.673 --> 02:15:10.378]  When the Congress has embraced that and enshrined it in law, not only is it shocking, but it means that the Supreme Court is almost certain to go along with it.
[02:15:10.438 --> 02:15:20.684]  I mean, of course, this Court might be willing to go anyway, but, you know, just in our system, in our legal system, the courts usually defer if both the executive and the legislative decide something.
[02:15:20.704 --> 02:15:22.025]  You know, well, this is heavy.
[02:15:23.703 --> 02:15:24.824]  Heavy artillery on their side.
[02:15:25.064 --> 02:15:30.467]  Of course, you know, I mean, we don't make too much of these comparisons, although I do here, between what happened in Germany, but why not?
[02:15:30.527 --> 02:15:31.467]  I mean, it is a lot like that.
[02:15:31.487 --> 02:15:33.468]  This is what the Nazis did, too.
[02:15:33.528 --> 02:15:42.773]  They took the legal structure, you know, the formal legal legislative structure in Germany at that time, and they used it, you know, to seize power illegally.
[02:15:42.853 --> 02:15:44.074]  That's what we've seen here, you see.
[02:15:45.255 --> 02:15:46.936]  It's really... No, you're right.
[02:15:46.956 --> 02:15:49.097]  I mean, it's a horrible thing, and I agree with Ed Asner.
[02:15:49.117 --> 02:15:50.317]  You know, it's like someone has died.
[02:15:50.337 --> 02:15:51.358]  Someone has died, you know.
[02:15:52.298 --> 02:15:53.239]  Our country has died, so...
[02:15:55.257 --> 02:15:57.837]  I just, they really threw down the gauntlet here.
[02:15:57.897 --> 02:16:16.761]  Do you think, some people hope that, well, Congress did this because they knew that Bush could be indicted, or he could be impeached and then indicted for torture, for war crimes, for illegal spying, that this was them trying to buttress him, but it doesn't matter because he's already declared these powers, he's sworn to use them.
[02:16:17.141 --> 02:16:17.301]  Yes.
[02:16:18.221 --> 02:16:23.202]  Well, he openly declared he's going to use them, and yes, and that's the part of the bill that I actually didn't get into, but you're right to bring it up.
[02:16:23.712 --> 02:16:29.435]  Because, as you say, my article was long, and I didn't have room to get all of the horrors in this bill into this article.
[02:16:29.955 --> 02:16:31.956]  Is this immunity provision?
[02:16:32.656 --> 02:16:33.537]  Yes, that was a big part of it.
[02:16:33.557 --> 02:16:38.839]  I mean, that's probably the main part to Bush, because, as you say, he's already claimed to use these powers, but what he wanted was this immunity provision.
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:51.945]  But, you know, it's hard to... Of course, these are war crimes that he's committed openly, and this, you know, warrantless surveillance program is an open, in-your-face, brazen, I'm bragging about it,
[02:16:54.028 --> 02:16:55.829]  I mean, they're doing this for a reason.
[02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:56.570]  We're going to break.
[02:16:56.590 --> 02:16:57.951]  Chris Floyd is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:16:57.971 --> 02:16:59.552]  He joins us from Oxford, England.
[02:16:59.572 --> 02:17:00.753]  We're extremely honored to have him.
[02:17:23.951 --> 02:17:25.513]  I want to get into the Iran War.
[02:17:25.573 --> 02:17:27.074]  Where do you see this going next?
[02:17:27.134 --> 02:17:29.757]  I mean, they just keep marching down the road to tyranny.
[02:17:29.817 --> 02:17:34.983]  They keep moving forward at every level, dismantling the United States.
[02:17:35.083 --> 02:17:36.444]  The United States is an idea.
[02:17:36.544 --> 02:17:37.065]  It's law.
[02:17:37.525 --> 02:17:38.907]  It's the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:17:38.947 --> 02:17:40.388]  And it has been overturned.
[02:17:41.249 --> 02:17:43.972]  It still lives in our hearts and minds, but it has been overturned.
[02:17:46.269 --> 02:17:48.750]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:17:48.871 --> 02:17:51.232]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:17:51.292 --> 02:17:58.376]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[02:17:58.956 --> 02:18:01.258]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:18:01.918 --> 02:18:05.460]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.143]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:18:10.723 --> 02:18:13.665]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:18:14.648 --> 02:18:17.589]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:24.310]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:27.391]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:18:27.631 --> 02:18:31.052]  For the following two free reports.
[02:18:31.932 --> 02:18:32.212]  U.S.
[02:18:32.312 --> 02:18:35.233]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:18:36.173 --> 02:18:38.474]  Call 888-XANADU.
[02:18:38.534 --> 02:18:42.715]  That's 888-XANADU.
[02:18:43.055 --> 02:18:44.015]  And ask for George.
[02:18:45.140 --> 02:18:46.342]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[02:18:46.382 --> 02:18:47.625]  Today is October 5th, 2006.
[02:18:47.705 --> 02:18:48.266]  Gold opened at $573.80.
[02:18:48.306 --> 02:18:50.189]  And one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $605.44.
[02:18:50.229 --> 02:18:52.373]  Again that's $605.44 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[02:18:58.874 --> 02:19:01.555]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[02:19:02.035 --> 02:19:06.636]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[02:19:07.056 --> 02:19:08.457]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[02:19:08.917 --> 02:19:12.058]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[02:19:12.418 --> 02:19:17.899]  We, the people, labor to create the money only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[02:19:18.279 --> 02:19:19.840]  They, in turn, lend it back to us
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:23.982]  And we the people are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[02:19:24.362 --> 02:19:29.265]  Midas Resources is offering the creature from Jekyll Island a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[02:19:29.665 --> 02:19:29.966]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.986 --> 02:19:32.387]  If you haven't read this book, get a copy today.
[02:19:32.407 --> 02:19:32.447]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:32.907 --> 02:19:35.028]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[02:19:35.068 --> 02:19:35.369]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.501 --> 02:19:48.522]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:19:48.842 --> 02:19:53.763]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:19:54.023 --> 02:19:58.364]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:19:58.664 --> 02:20:07.586]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:20:07.786 --> 02:20:11.407]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:20:11.707 --> 02:20:16.732]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:20:17.032 --> 02:20:23.758]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:20:24.238 --> 02:20:24.779]  What about you?
[02:20:25.527 --> 02:20:30.894]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:20:30.954 --> 02:20:32.035]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:20:32.115 --> 02:20:34.017]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:49.207]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:49.427 --> 02:20:52.833]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:53.013 --> 02:20:56.439]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:56.747 --> 02:20:59.990]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:05.475]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:21:05.515 --> 02:21:15.144]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:15.284 --> 02:21:16.625]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:21:16.645 --> 02:21:22.070]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:22.546 --> 02:21:26.988]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:27.068 --> 02:21:28.429]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:28.609 --> 02:21:32.471]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:32.491 --> 02:21:33.351]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:52.820]  They're going for broke, my friends.
[02:21:52.860 --> 02:21:55.901]  You see, once a government goes this criminal, it's like a Ponzi scheme.
[02:21:55.941 --> 02:22:04.684]  They've got to keep putting more and more in, just to keep it expanding onto the next front, bigger and bigger, or it will fall in on itself.
[02:22:05.285 --> 02:22:16.415]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon, getting rid of our borders, setting up the North American Union, all the no-bid contracts, the corruption, the sex scandals, just all of it!
[02:22:16.816 --> 02:22:17.937]  A pack of criminals!
[02:22:17.957 --> 02:22:18.858]  We've become Rome!
[02:22:20.759 --> 02:22:25.744]  And they're passing laws to take all your private property, they're passing laws to give you all these new taxes,
[02:22:26.707 --> 02:22:28.808]  I mean, and don't think the Democrats will save you.
[02:22:28.828 --> 02:22:34.130]  This is both parties, but this particular brand with the Bushies is deadly dangerous.
[02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:36.671]  Chris Floyd, you've been covering politics for decades.
[02:22:36.711 --> 02:22:39.452]  You've really been watching these neocons for a long time.
[02:22:39.472 --> 02:22:42.613]  You've made a lot of good predictions and analysis in the past.
[02:22:43.634 --> 02:22:47.575]  Projecting forward with your dead reckoning, what do you see happening with Iran?
[02:22:47.635 --> 02:22:50.456]  What do you see happening with the neocon hubris?
[02:22:50.516 --> 02:22:52.477]  I mean, are we just going off the end of the cliff here?
[02:22:53.601 --> 02:22:56.364]  Well, actually, that's the question of the day, isn't it?
[02:22:56.424 --> 02:23:11.160]  I mean, I think one thing we might be seeing, I mean, it comes down to if the American establishment, you know, sort of the old line American establishment, where the power really is, you know, if they go along with it, then we are going off the deep end and they've gone along with everything so far.
[02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:14.243]  I think some, you know, I wrote recently about this Bob Woodward book.
[02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:19.253]  It's sort of like, what I think about... It was a great article, you called it War in Heaven.
[02:23:19.273 --> 02:23:20.014]  Tell us about that.
[02:23:20.354 --> 02:23:21.855]  Well, it's the elite.
[02:23:21.895 --> 02:23:24.118]  You know, this whole thing is a scramble between the elite, you see.
[02:23:24.138 --> 02:23:25.699]  Now, you've got the Bush faction elite.
[02:23:26.079 --> 02:23:30.043]  That's your old, you know, your oil guys, your right-wing Christian cranks and all these people.
[02:23:30.363 --> 02:23:33.786]  And you've got your old line of establishment that George Bush's father sort of represents, you know.
[02:23:33.806 --> 02:23:40.873]  These guys that go back decades, generations of old money and old rapacious elite, you know, going back generations.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:47.162]  I think Woodward has always sort of spoken for that establishment, you know, that faction of the establishment.
[02:23:47.182 --> 02:23:52.244]  I think this book is sort of a way to sort of rattle Junior Bush a little bit.
[02:23:52.424 --> 02:23:55.505]  It's a little squabble between the elite, you see.
[02:23:57.526 --> 02:24:00.967]  And I think the Iran thing is sort of scaring them.
[02:24:01.027 --> 02:24:04.708]  And to me, that's where the sort of... As I mention this article, I'm sorry I'm not making much sense.
[02:24:04.748 --> 02:24:06.869]  As I mention this article, this is what's really sort of bad about it.
[02:24:07.029 --> 02:24:07.810]  It's not up to us.
[02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:08.910]  It's not up to we, the people.
[02:24:09.589 --> 02:24:15.012]  It's how these elite factions, and some of it even within one family, the Bush family, how they resolve their differences.
[02:24:15.072 --> 02:24:18.553]  It's going to depend on whether or not we attack Iran.
[02:24:18.914 --> 02:24:21.435]  So you believe that Fisher is real?
[02:24:21.495 --> 02:24:33.401]  I mean, I wasn't sure if it was real until this year at Bilderberg in Ottawa, we confirmed they were having screaming cussing matches, and that the neocons are now in the minority but in control of the U.S.
[02:24:33.461 --> 02:24:34.221]  war engine.
[02:24:34.701 --> 02:24:37.523]  I think that's right, but the point is how far they will go with it.
[02:24:37.543 --> 02:24:38.503]  I think you're exactly right about that.
[02:24:59.935 --> 02:25:01.455]  And they were a little bit worried about the Iraq War.
[02:25:01.475 --> 02:25:07.957]  You know, before Iraq, there was these articles from Scowcroft and all these people, and sort of little shots crossed the bow from daddy to junior there.
[02:25:08.417 --> 02:25:13.078]  But in the end, they buckled under with it, you know, because... Where do you think Rockefeller is in people like that?
[02:25:13.898 --> 02:25:21.320]  Well, you know, I think all the sort of old line people, they found that, you know, Junior Bush and the Bush faction had been so sweet to them.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:24.060]  You know, tax cuts, no regulations, all this kind of stuff.
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:25.741]  You know, just open the treasure to them.
[02:25:25.761 --> 02:25:26.621]  You know, war profits.
[02:25:27.102 --> 02:25:35.248]  It's just been too sweet for them to give up the goods, you know, but I think what they're worried about now is it's getting a little too far, and you might just kill the whole, you know, you might kill the whole golden goose.
[02:25:35.628 --> 02:25:40.131]  But, again, it's just a matter of them making that decision, you know.
[02:25:40.151 --> 02:25:40.892]  Do we go with this?
[02:25:40.912 --> 02:25:43.974]  Do we think, well, maybe we can weather this Iran thing and come out better?
[02:25:44.514 --> 02:25:45.155]  Or maybe not.
[02:25:45.995 --> 02:25:50.198]  But in any case, as I mentioned in this article, you know, they're not going to bring George W. Bush down all the way.
[02:25:50.238 --> 02:25:51.679]  They might rattle his cage a little bit.
[02:25:51.699 --> 02:25:55.642]  They might try to pull him back, and like you say, they might wrap a few of the neocons a little bit.
[02:25:56.107 --> 02:26:05.069]  But it also depends on whether these forces that they've unleashed, the neocons and the right-wing Christians, you know, they may be stronger than, too strong to pull back on the reins now, you know.
[02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:11.731]  I mean, you know, they've sort of used these people, you know, as sort of a mutual benefit for everyone around.
[02:26:11.811 --> 02:26:15.332]  And Chris, when you say right-wing Christians, I mean, these aren't real right-wing Christians.
[02:26:15.372 --> 02:26:22.133]  You mean the cult-like, nuke-the-world, end-the-planet, bring-Jesus-back, George Bush's Jesus crowd.
[02:26:22.593 --> 02:26:23.694]  Yes, of course, that's what I mean.
[02:26:23.714 --> 02:26:24.914]  I don't mean people that actually would
[02:26:25.365 --> 02:26:29.326]  Have any resemblance whatsoever to someone who followed any of the teachings of Jesus and Nazareth.
[02:26:29.346 --> 02:26:32.667]  You know, we're talking about these politicized cult figures, absolutely.
[02:26:33.307 --> 02:26:38.509]  But, you know, I don't know, that's just the big question to me, is if the establishment is going to go along with Iran.
[02:26:38.529 --> 02:26:44.231]  But I think that the Bush people, the Cheney faction, the Rumsfeld faction, they will attack Iran.
[02:26:44.251 --> 02:26:45.351]  I mean, this is what they've come in to do.
[02:26:45.371 --> 02:26:46.552]  This is what they're there for, you know.
[02:26:46.752 --> 02:26:50.833]  And as you say, they need to keep, as you say, it's like a Ponzi scheme.
[02:26:50.853 --> 02:26:54.234]  You have to keep upping and anting, upping and anting, because, just again, as you said,
[02:26:54.775 --> 02:26:56.096]  So much stuff is coming out now.
[02:26:56.176 --> 02:26:58.078]  Sex scandals, corruption scandals.
[02:26:58.898 --> 02:27:00.219]  Bush has been rumbled on all of it.
[02:27:00.239 --> 02:27:08.166]  You've got, what, 65% of the people believe now that Bush lied about Iraq, which is pretty good since he obviously lied from day one.
[02:27:08.646 --> 02:27:10.688]  But I mean, we've got that going on.
[02:27:10.708 --> 02:27:12.769]  As you say, they've got to keep upping the ante.
[02:27:12.789 --> 02:27:14.791]  They've got to keep getting worse and worse to stay ahead of all that.
[02:27:14.871 --> 02:27:16.052]  And so that's what makes me think.
[02:27:16.621 --> 02:27:18.403]  More and more there's going to be some sort of attack on Iran.
[02:27:18.423 --> 02:27:21.025]  They're putting everything in place.
[02:27:21.085 --> 02:27:24.268]  They've got some battle groups in the ocean over there.
[02:27:24.288 --> 02:27:26.129]  They've got at least two battle groups.
[02:27:26.149 --> 02:27:27.791]  Let's talk about that in detail when we get back.
[02:27:27.851 --> 02:27:31.194]  Ante calls Chris Floyd, internationally syndicated columnist.
[02:27:31.654 --> 02:27:33.276]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.296 --> 02:27:33.356]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:36.038 --> 02:27:36.959]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.439 --> 02:27:39.041]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.961 --> 02:27:42.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.065 --> 02:27:50.366]  If you're tired of spending a small fortune every time you fill up, now you can do something about it!
[02:27:50.606 --> 02:27:57.087]  Ethos FR, a product used all over the world, has reported savings of up to 19% on gas, and even reduced emissions of up to 30%!
[02:27:57.187 --> 02:28:02.568]  Ethos FR is easy to use, and works with any kind of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.
[02:28:02.728 --> 02:28:10.029]  Ethos FR works by reformulating the gas in your tank to burn more completely, resulting in a cleaner engine, better mileage, more power, and fewer emissions.
[02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:13.230]  So visit ctsafegas.com and start saving today!
[02:28:13.370 --> 02:28:15.070]  That's ctsafegas.com!
[02:28:16.673 --> 02:28:19.155]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:28:19.616 --> 02:28:21.537]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:28:22.238 --> 02:28:25.421]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:28:26.061 --> 02:28:32.547]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:28:33.328 --> 02:28:35.530]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:36.351]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:28:36.431 --> 02:28:37.812]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:28:46.568 --> 02:28:55.632]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:28:55.892 --> 02:29:07.116]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:07.457 --> 02:29:13.159]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:29:13.399 --> 02:29:20.104]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:20.264 --> 02:29:27.090]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:27.370 --> 02:29:29.151]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:29:29.391 --> 02:29:31.453]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:29:31.533 --> 02:29:32.755]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[02:29:32.795 --> 02:29:33.356]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:33.376 --> 02:29:35.719]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:46.033 --> 02:29:48.196]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[02:29:48.597 --> 02:29:55.186]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[02:29:55.467 --> 02:30:01.856]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the Mystery Schools long before the Messiah was born.
[02:30:02.216 --> 02:30:06.778]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts, the worship of pagan gods prevailed.
[02:30:07.078 --> 02:30:12.520]  The Church's sacred cannibalism service, known as Communion, is based upon words the Messiah never said.
[02:30:12.780 --> 02:30:14.081]  The Savior was no cannibal.
[02:30:14.341 --> 02:30:15.501]  He lived and taught the Torah.
[02:30:15.841 --> 02:30:16.301]  See proof?
[02:30:16.582 --> 02:30:17.122]  Get the book.
[02:30:17.342 --> 02:30:19.283]  Communion, Bloodfest of Babylon today.
[02:30:19.583 --> 02:30:21.323]  Write to Two Witnesses Ministries, P.O.
[02:30:21.343 --> 02:30:22.104]  Box 2453, Abilene, Texas 79604.
[02:30:22.264 --> 02:30:22.504]  Or call 325-572-3913.
[02:30:31.047 --> 02:30:35.969]  Yes, Gnostics did hijack the antique to fulfill their devious plan to make abomination look holy.
[02:30:36.229 --> 02:30:40.250]  Gnostic conspiracy exposed in Communion, Bloodfest of Babylon.
[02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:41.931]  Call 325-572-3913.
[02:30:42.251 --> 02:30:52.294]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.974 --> 02:30:55.335]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:55.355 --> 02:30:57.516]  Chris Floyd's our guest.
[02:30:57.556 --> 02:30:58.876]  We're gonna open the phones up.
[02:30:59.728 --> 02:31:08.512]  Later in this segment, 1-800-259-9231, we're talking about the official abolishment of the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:08.712 --> 02:31:23.218]  And again, hundreds of different editorialists, political scientists, PhDs in political science, constitutional scholars, conservatives, liberals, libertarians, they've all read the bill and they're all saying it killed the Republic.
[02:31:23.778 --> 02:31:25.779]  My article said they killed the Republic.
[02:31:26.488 --> 02:31:28.749]  Chris Floyd's article said, they killed the Republic.
[02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:29.390]  Okay?
[02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:34.053]  Everyone unanimously, without looking at each other, within a day, had written the same thing.
[02:31:34.713 --> 02:31:35.874]  Because we went and read the bill.
[02:31:35.934 --> 02:31:39.636]  Go read this horror for yourself!
[02:31:43.098 --> 02:31:44.399]  H.R.
[02:31:44.419 --> 02:31:44.399]  6166.
[02:31:44.879 --> 02:31:49.402]  If you don't have total allegiance to Bush's government, you're a terrorist.
[02:31:49.742 --> 02:31:50.963]  And you don't get due process.
[02:31:52.085 --> 02:31:53.966]  You can be tortured, or what they call it, pressure.
[02:31:53.986 --> 02:31:58.227]  Before we go back to Chris Floyd and your calls, give me that number 1-800-259-9231.
[02:32:00.088 --> 02:32:02.489]  I said that a little quick, didn't I?
[02:32:02.509 --> 02:32:03.529]  800-259-9231.
[02:32:03.909 --> 02:32:08.011]  We're carrying a new video, 9-11 Mysteries Part 1 Demolitions.
[02:32:09.031 --> 02:32:12.712]  And this 90-minute documentary just focuses on how they blew the buildings up.
[02:32:12.932 --> 02:32:13.672]  The inside job.
[02:32:14.093 --> 02:32:16.453]  It's got footage never before seen, interviews never before seen.
[02:32:16.493 --> 02:32:17.894]  It is a Cracker Jack film.
[02:32:19.025 --> 02:32:22.968]  This focuses in on just one area of 9-11 in great detail.
[02:32:23.069 --> 02:32:23.849]  It's a great tactic.
[02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:25.631]  Great voiceover.
[02:32:25.651 --> 02:32:26.632]  A woman voices it.
[02:32:27.012 --> 02:32:27.793]  Very professional.
[02:32:27.813 --> 02:32:28.933]  Very well done out in Hollywood.
[02:32:29.334 --> 02:32:29.974]  We're carrying it.
[02:32:29.994 --> 02:32:35.239]  We have it for you on InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:35.719 --> 02:32:41.124]  There, of course, is my new film, Terror Storm, which is the opposite of 9-11 Mysteries.
[02:32:41.444 --> 02:32:42.365]  It's the wide view.
[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:50.825]  The history of government-sponsored terror, 9-11, 7-7, proving it was an inside job, the Madrid bombing.
[02:32:51.846 --> 02:32:58.991]  We get into the lies that took us to war in Iraq, how they premeditatedly in the White House and Downing Street memos said they'd lie.
[02:32:59.471 --> 02:33:05.175]  We get into the warrantless spying, the torture of children, John Hughes' own memos.
[02:33:05.749 --> 02:33:07.712]  Believe me, it's a film you need to have.
[02:33:07.792 --> 02:33:10.396]  Terror Storm, almost two hours long.
[02:33:10.436 --> 02:33:13.179]  The extras are 68 minutes, so it's over three hours total.
[02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:19.388]  Of the 9-11 Neocon Symposium that was historical, we had that over 1,200 people attended in Los Angeles in June.
[02:33:21.331 --> 02:33:23.351]  $19.95 and we do want people to carry it.
[02:33:23.371 --> 02:33:24.532]  We want people to get it out to folks.
[02:33:24.552 --> 02:33:30.235]  If you want to be a bulk slash, I guess, seller of this, you can also call my office 512-291-5750.
[02:33:30.255 --> 02:33:30.355]  512-291-5750.
[02:33:30.395 --> 02:33:31.615]  Or again, you can call 1-877-996-4327.
[02:33:31.655 --> 02:33:32.496]  I'm losing my mind.
[02:33:32.516 --> 02:33:33.316]  Too many numbers.
[02:33:33.336 --> 02:33:35.137]  That's the network back line.
[02:33:48.985 --> 02:33:49.145]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139
[02:33:58.363 --> 02:34:00.003]  And I carry dozens of other films.
[02:34:00.063 --> 02:34:00.904]  I've made 15 films.
[02:34:01.064 --> 02:34:04.324]  I've got a lot of other books and videos by great researchers and authors we carry.
[02:34:04.384 --> 02:34:05.285]  You need to have it.
[02:34:05.345 --> 02:34:05.945]  You need to get them.
[02:34:06.285 --> 02:34:10.666]  Again, Infowars.com or 888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Street 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:34:10.866 --> 02:34:12.026]  And you're encouraged, and I beg you,
[02:34:21.252 --> 02:34:24.494]  To make copies of all my videos, the 15 films I've made.
[02:34:24.514 --> 02:34:30.479]  I don't want you to get them unless you're going to burn a few copies of the DVDs or the VHS and give them to people.
[02:34:31.119 --> 02:34:31.359]  Look!
[02:34:31.659 --> 02:34:32.700]  We're not going to have a country.
[02:34:33.441 --> 02:34:35.562]  They're going to take over even worse than they already have.
[02:34:35.582 --> 02:34:36.843]  They're going to get real abusive.
[02:34:38.264 --> 02:34:41.466]  The electronic voting machine frauds, the land grabbing, all of it.
[02:34:41.506 --> 02:34:42.647]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[02:34:43.228 --> 02:34:45.049]  And I'm not going to give up and roll over and die.
[02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:46.370]  So join me in this fight.
[02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:47.931]  You can also go to Google Video.
[02:34:49.361 --> 02:34:53.423]  And type TERRORSTORM, that's TERRORSTORM, and even if you've already done this, do it again.
[02:34:53.723 --> 02:34:56.944]  Get it, email it out to your whole email list, post it on your website.
[02:34:57.204 --> 02:35:10.049]  I want you to call into every talk show, liberal, conservative, patriot, mainstream, and tell them, hey, TERRORSTORM, the documentary of the resistance, as Kurt Nemo said, it's for free on Google Video.
[02:35:10.149 --> 02:35:11.750]  TERRORSTORM, Google it.
[02:35:12.090 --> 02:35:13.511]  TERRORSTORM, Google it.
[02:35:13.891 --> 02:35:14.291]  Tell them!
[02:35:17.014 --> 02:35:22.099]  We are desperately trying to cause a revelation, a renaissance of understanding here.
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:27.324]  We have had over 4 million downloads in the last month and a half on Google Video for Terror Storm.
[02:35:27.945 --> 02:35:34.471]  They are deleting our rankings every time we hit several million in the aggregate so we don't go into the top 100.
[02:35:34.811 --> 02:35:35.692]  We've been in the top 100 one time.
[02:35:37.125 --> 02:35:38.426]  And that's when they started deleting us.
[02:35:38.466 --> 02:35:42.048]  They do not want this to be a phenomenon like Loose Change Second Edition.
[02:35:42.428 --> 02:35:43.628]  Don't let them have their way.
[02:35:43.688 --> 02:35:49.632]  Even if they're deleting our rankings, still millions will be able to see it until they erase it, I guess, entirely.
[02:35:49.872 --> 02:35:52.653]  We have it up on YouTube in 12 parts.
[02:35:53.834 --> 02:35:54.554]  It's all over the web.
[02:35:54.574 --> 02:35:56.335]  Just get out there and get it, folks.
[02:35:56.595 --> 02:36:00.797]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv where it's in super high quality down to low quality.
[02:36:00.817 --> 02:36:03.899]  We have four different versions of it depending on your connection rate.
[02:36:05.029 --> 02:36:05.549]  We're good to go.
[02:36:27.179 --> 02:36:32.021]  Just every night, make 10 copies while you're sitting there watching TV or surfing the web, and then hand them out to people!
[02:36:32.101 --> 02:36:32.662]  Help us!
[02:36:33.142 --> 02:36:35.863]  Seriously, folks, I don't want to have to evacuate the U.S.
[02:36:36.483 --> 02:36:39.945]  And I've said I'm going to stay here if there's any chance of saving the country.
[02:36:40.665 --> 02:36:42.426]  I may evacuate my family.
[02:36:42.506 --> 02:36:45.827]  I'm seriously looking at evacuating the United States.
[02:36:46.308 --> 02:36:47.648]  I mean, it's that bad, folks.
[02:36:47.928 --> 02:36:48.369]  I've said it.
[02:36:48.789 --> 02:36:53.751]  If it was some new country that was free like America was to some extent in the 50s, habeas corpus,
[02:36:54.594 --> 02:36:59.758]  Free market, Bill of Rights, and I was like a German or a Jew, I'd leave Germany.
[02:37:00.198 --> 02:37:01.299]  There's nowhere to go.
[02:37:01.399 --> 02:37:02.520]  It's a global government.
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:09.605]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go back to our guest, Chris Floyd, prolific syndicated columnist, writes for some of the biggest papers in the world.
[02:37:10.085 --> 02:37:14.208]  Chris Floyd, tell us about your new book, Empire Burlesque.
[02:37:15.249 --> 02:37:20.433]  Oh, well, that's a, yes, Empire Burlesque, High Crimes and Low Comedy in the Bush and Pym.
[02:37:20.733 --> 02:37:21.334]  It's basically
[02:37:22.503 --> 02:37:25.384]  Sort of a history of how we got to where we are today.
[02:37:25.404 --> 02:37:37.329]  A history, a real-time history on the ground as it's happening, because it's taken from these weekly columns that I wrote for, again, mostly for the Moscow Times and also for Counterpunch, a couple pieces for The Nation, things like that.
[02:37:37.649 --> 02:37:45.532]  Mostly Moscow Times and Counterpunch, and other pieces are on the web, and now of course for my blog, which got started last year, and it's called Empire Burlesque also.
[02:37:46.072 --> 02:37:51.794]  And what it gives you is just, it sort of lays it out step-by-step, how we got to this, what was going on,
[02:37:52.276 --> 02:37:58.258]  You can just see... Well, one good thing is, as you read, you can see the patterns forming, and you see how they just repeat over and over again.
[02:37:58.298 --> 02:38:00.879]  If you read this page... And everybody should get Empire Burlesque.
[02:38:00.919 --> 02:38:01.799]  Here's the problem.
[02:38:01.839 --> 02:38:06.561]  If you follow the trend, and it's not stopping, I see where it leads, Chris.
[02:38:07.321 --> 02:38:08.362]  I know you see where it leads.
[02:38:08.402 --> 02:38:10.282]  Tell folks where it leads!
[02:38:11.203 --> 02:38:15.024]  Well, I mean, you just look at... It leads to what we've just practically got right now.
[02:38:15.044 --> 02:38:17.225]  It leads to an authoritarian, militarized,
[02:38:18.197 --> 02:38:25.802]  Leader state, you know, the Unitary Executive States of America, as I would call it now, the U.E.S.A.
[02:38:25.882 --> 02:38:31.265]  At least what we have right now, you know, we have a step-by-step we're getting into this.
[02:38:31.325 --> 02:38:40.511]  I mean, of course, you know, what the Bush people have done, they've exacerbated and carried forward trends that have been in the American system for many years.
[02:38:40.571 --> 02:38:41.371]  I mean, you know that also.
[02:38:41.631 --> 02:38:44.413]  But it's now coming to its scrofulous head.
[02:38:44.593 --> 02:38:45.914]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:38:45.934 --> 02:38:47.715]  You know, it's the apotheosis of all this sort of stuff.
[02:38:48.516 --> 02:38:57.562]  And the book will just sort of show you how that has happened, you know, step by step, and brings up right up to probably about three months ago.
[02:38:57.642 --> 02:38:59.783]  So, you know, it just gets you right into where we are.
[02:39:00.343 --> 02:39:01.724]  The whole thing, you know, Fallujah.
[02:39:01.764 --> 02:39:08.788]  I mean, one good thing about all these things you may have forgotten as new outrages come along, you know, is, oh, right, you know, what about Fallujah when they did this?
[02:39:08.828 --> 02:39:09.249]  What about this?
[02:39:09.269 --> 02:39:09.929]  What about that?
[02:39:09.949 --> 02:39:11.070]  What about that?
[02:39:11.290 --> 02:39:12.591]  But as you get back to Iran, one
[02:39:13.857 --> 02:39:33.642]  One salient point that might be gotten from the book, is if you watch, because I was tracking this build up to the war, to Iraq, long before they started ruling it out in September 2002, but even before that I was tracking their statements, tracking their actions, tracking their troop movements, and you can just see it was coming and there was no way it was not going to come, the war against Iraq.
[02:39:33.662 --> 02:39:42.024]  That's right, and do you see that same pattern now, that they've already committed, point of no return, whatever they say is window dressing, they're going to strike Iran?
[02:39:43.024 --> 02:39:44.104]  I see that pattern happening.
[02:39:44.244 --> 02:39:52.726]  I can't, I can't, I don't have the same sense of absolute certainty that it's going to happen just because the sort of meta-situation I'm in, the political situation I'm in.
[02:39:52.746 --> 02:39:54.247]  That's right, the tide has turned against them.
[02:39:54.567 --> 02:39:59.268]  Somewhat, because of people like you, because of all the people that are, you know, because the polls are against them.
[02:39:59.288 --> 02:40:01.128]  But here's the problem, here's the problem.
[02:40:01.148 --> 02:40:02.089]  I know you've said this before.
[02:40:03.949 --> 02:40:08.230]  Them having their backs against the wall, them having their poll numbers drop, even makes it more dangerous.
[02:40:08.717 --> 02:40:09.498]  Because then what else?
[02:40:09.798 --> 02:40:11.019]  They have nothing else to do.
[02:40:11.059 --> 02:40:16.642]  That's what I was going to say, Chris Floyd, author of Empire Burlesque, is that it's a catch-22.
[02:40:16.682 --> 02:40:21.746]  If we let them do what they want, they're going to stage attacks and stage provocations and attack Iran.
[02:40:22.026 --> 02:40:27.510]  But if we do press them all the way to the wall, they may do something even bigger, like government-sponsored terror.
[02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:28.631]  Well, absolutely.
[02:40:30.012 --> 02:40:31.312]  All the elements are in place.
[02:40:31.533 --> 02:40:35.515]  As you've noted before, all the elements are in place for them to do anything they want to.
[02:40:35.595 --> 02:40:36.476]  All the elements are in place
[02:40:37.071 --> 02:40:43.195]  Right now for the attack on Iraq, you know, as Cy Hirsch reported months ago, we've got covert operators inside Iraq.
[02:40:43.275 --> 02:40:43.995]  And you have seen it.
[02:40:44.035 --> 02:40:44.936]  You've probably seen the news.
[02:40:44.956 --> 02:40:47.157]  Of course, these are in the back pages of the news and the briefs.
[02:40:47.577 --> 02:40:50.419]  You know, little terrorist attacks happening inside Iran all the time.
[02:40:50.459 --> 02:40:51.660]  Terrorist attacks all the time.
[02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:53.681]  You know, we've got the
[02:40:54.895 --> 02:40:55.735]  The M.E.K.
[02:40:55.795 --> 02:40:58.256]  terrorist group stationed in Iraq.
[02:40:58.436 --> 02:40:59.416]  They're Iranian terrorists.
[02:40:59.436 --> 02:41:00.136]  You've probably heard of them.
[02:41:00.156 --> 02:41:03.357]  They're sort of a cult-like Iranian terrorist group that Saddam Hussein took in.
[02:41:03.697 --> 02:41:06.758]  And they acted as assassins and enforcers for Saddam Hussein.
[02:41:07.038 --> 02:41:08.018]  And now Bush has adopted them.
[02:41:08.058 --> 02:41:09.599]  And he's getting ready to unleash them on Iran.
[02:41:10.639 --> 02:41:13.579]  We've got the naval battle groups that we've talked about.
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:16.420]  We've got all these things ready.
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:18.241]  Whatever they want to do for Iran, they can do.
[02:41:18.681 --> 02:41:23.682]  And also, as you've covered in all your writings and movies, the infrastructure for
[02:41:25.533 --> 02:41:28.775]  Uh, the outright fascist state is already in place.
[02:41:28.815 --> 02:41:31.738]  You know, rounding up people, Halliburton's got their contracts.
[02:41:31.758 --> 02:41:35.501]  Yeah, I don't think Iran and Iraq are even the big targets.
[02:41:35.541 --> 02:41:36.361]  They're hors d'oeuvres.
[02:41:36.401 --> 02:41:38.403]  The real target is totally capturing us.
[02:41:38.663 --> 02:41:39.304]  Well, that's true.
[02:41:39.324 --> 02:41:40.685]  I mean, yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:40.725 --> 02:41:44.648]  But, well, I've always, you know, the war on terror is a war of terror.
[02:41:44.928 --> 02:41:46.509]  And one of the main targets is the homeland.
[02:41:46.549 --> 02:41:50.813]  You know, I mean, this word that they've used, this sort of awful word they've adopted for our
[02:41:53.447 --> 02:41:54.168]  We are the target.
[02:41:54.188 --> 02:41:55.168]  Of course we're part of the target.
[02:41:55.188 --> 02:41:57.009]  That's the thing, Chris Floyd.
[02:41:57.069 --> 02:42:00.251]  It seems like they're trying to adopt Nazi terminology.
[02:42:00.571 --> 02:42:03.533]  It seems like they're trying to be as thuggish and gangsterish.
[02:42:03.933 --> 02:42:05.214]  I mean, Homeland?
[02:42:05.514 --> 02:42:07.375]  Protect the Homeland?
[02:42:07.515 --> 02:42:08.736]  This is right out of 1984.
[02:42:08.836 --> 02:42:11.157]  Absolutely.
[02:42:11.217 --> 02:42:12.998]  I couldn't believe it when they first started using it.
[02:42:13.179 --> 02:42:14.019]  It popped out right after 9-11.
[02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:18.792]  As you say, they began adopting this terminology as if we'd always used it.
[02:42:18.973 --> 02:42:21.575]  Had you ever heard an American politician talk about the homeland?
[02:42:21.615 --> 02:42:22.556]  I mean, we didn't talk about that.
[02:42:22.576 --> 02:42:25.618]  They didn't have homeland security, homeland defense during World War II.
[02:42:25.658 --> 02:42:26.479]  It was nothing like that.
[02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:29.862]  You know, we talked about domestic defense.
[02:42:29.902 --> 02:42:31.383]  We talked about the country.
[02:42:31.423 --> 02:42:37.308]  I mean, but yes, they're adopting all these things because they're doing the same sort of thing, because they want unrestricted power.
[02:42:38.729 --> 02:42:43.813]  And if you want unrestricted power in a country, you will obviously do the same sort of things.
[02:42:43.833 --> 02:42:44.294]  You know, it's like a
[02:42:45.243 --> 02:42:59.676]  No matter what your ideology is, if your ideology is Nazism, or if it's Communism, or if it's whatever there is, there's a rapacious crony capitalism, whatever you want to call it, you're going to see the same sort of patterns emerging because that's just how you seize unrestrained power, you know, and the same sort of
[02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:03.321]  The same sort of lies, the same sort of subterfuge.
[02:43:03.401 --> 02:43:09.184]  And of course the Founding Fathers told us that the point of tyranny we'll live under is the exact point and level that we put up with.
[02:43:09.984 --> 02:43:17.928]  I guess if we weren't here resisting them to some extent, they'd already have a big black throne out and maybe triumphant arches built to Bush.
[02:43:17.948 --> 02:43:20.089]  He'd crown himself Supreme Emperor.
[02:43:20.109 --> 02:43:22.130]  I mean, I really think they would go that far.
[02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:23.570]  How far do you think they'll get?
[02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:27.212]  Because you talk about the tithes turned against them, but because of their massive
[02:43:29.293 --> 02:43:37.637]  It's like the inertia of this huge juggernaut is still rolling, it's slowing, but will it reach its goal before it finally stops?
[02:43:38.037 --> 02:43:40.058]  Well, again, Alex, this is the great question.
[02:43:40.279 --> 02:43:50.964]  I've said before many times, when people talk about, oh, well, the Iraq War is a quagmire, and all this kind of thing, but what the Iraq War has done, you see, is transferred billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[02:43:51.505 --> 02:43:53.106]  Out of the public treasury and out of Iraq.
[02:43:53.186 --> 02:43:54.807]  It was designed to be a quagmire.
[02:43:54.827 --> 02:43:56.348]  The longer it runs, the more money they get.
[02:43:56.428 --> 02:43:56.809]  That's right.
[02:43:56.829 --> 02:44:00.591]  And so, you take all that money, and it goes to the Bush faction and their cronies.
[02:44:00.631 --> 02:44:05.915]  I mean, that permanently alters, as you said, you know, the power balance in America for decades.
[02:44:05.935 --> 02:44:13.240]  No matter what happens in the next election, whatever happens in 2006, 2008, these people have massive amounts more money than they have more power than they have.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:14.841]  This is a huge Nazi war chest.
[02:44:15.381 --> 02:44:16.082]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:16.142 --> 02:44:16.802]  I mean, it will go on.
[02:44:17.042 --> 02:44:18.263]  You know, it will run for generations.
[02:44:18.283 --> 02:44:19.844]  So, I mean, yeah, that's a good question.
[02:44:19.904 --> 02:44:21.025]  I mean, whether they will
[02:44:21.983 --> 02:44:23.424]  You know, take it all the way or not.
[02:44:25.025 --> 02:44:27.926]  I don't see, at this point, I don't really see, but we'll stop there.
[02:44:27.966 --> 02:44:39.432]  Basically, it's like a big octopus that's come out from under the rock, eaten a couple big meals, gotten even fatter, and it may run up underneath the rock again if we drive it in there, but it's still going to be sneaking out, grabbing people forever.
[02:44:40.032 --> 02:44:45.135]  Well, of course, because if you go back, you know, I go back to, like, tracking politics a long way.
[02:44:45.155 --> 02:44:47.716]  I mean, I was a young man then, but back during the Nixon days.
[02:44:48.537 --> 02:44:50.898]  And, you know, we felt like, at that time, Watergate
[02:44:51.508 --> 02:44:55.110]  Nixon's impeachment resignation, you know, we sort of killed the snake, right?
[02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:56.431]  We sort of killed the octopus, you know.
[02:44:56.491 --> 02:44:58.792]  Wow, you know, now we're free of all this stuff.
[02:44:58.812 --> 02:45:02.153]  But, you know, you have to maintain that vigilance because it comes back.
[02:45:02.194 --> 02:45:03.454]  These people in power now, who?
[02:45:03.554 --> 02:45:08.217]  Cheney, Rumsfeld, Kissinger, for God's sake, you know, being the main advisor to these people.
[02:45:08.457 --> 02:45:09.377]  It all has come back.
[02:45:09.417 --> 02:45:10.338]  You can't ever relax.
[02:45:10.358 --> 02:45:10.818]  You can't ever...
[02:45:11.365 --> 02:45:13.588]  I did a personal analysis of dictatorships of Bush and Hussein.
[02:45:31.468 --> 02:45:35.829]  And everything that Bush was accusing Hussein of doing, he is not doing.
[02:45:35.930 --> 02:45:38.150]  Yeah, ripe rooms, secret police, dead hands.
[02:45:38.170 --> 02:45:39.211]  The whole nine yards.
[02:45:39.551 --> 02:45:44.912]  What I wanted to do is, since everybody's chomping at the bit, saying, what can I do, what can I do, what can I do?
[02:45:45.213 --> 02:45:46.453]  I just wanted to say this.
[02:45:46.673 --> 02:45:49.134]  We should have a Constitution Action Day.
[02:45:49.614 --> 02:45:54.396]  And if anything happens before we get that off, we should have a Constitution Reaction Day.
[02:45:54.956 --> 02:45:57.437]  And I wanted to be the point man for it.
[02:45:57.737 --> 02:45:58.417]  I wanted to
[02:45:59.266 --> 02:46:00.327]  Get all the materials.
[02:46:00.487 --> 02:46:01.708]  People just download it.
[02:46:01.748 --> 02:46:03.129]  Don't even say who you are.
[02:46:03.649 --> 02:46:05.751]  Just set things up in your own community.
[02:46:05.771 --> 02:46:15.317]  At the end of the evening, pull out one of Alex's videos, pop it in the VCR, DVD, whatever, and just make a potluck night out of it.
[02:46:15.738 --> 02:46:19.280]  And just discuss the Constitution, Bill of Rights, everything.
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:27.566]  Because I think they're able to... But the government would call that Terror Day, because in a bunch of their federally written manuals, they say those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:46:27.606 --> 02:46:28.967]  Constitution are terrorists.
[02:46:29.702 --> 02:46:32.124]  Well, that's too bad.
[02:46:32.344 --> 02:46:34.526]  I mean, they really do say that, but who cares about these terrorists?
[02:46:34.766 --> 02:46:35.627]  They're really the terrorists.
[02:46:35.947 --> 02:46:37.709]  And listen, send me some info on that.
[02:46:37.729 --> 02:46:38.850]  We might work on something like that.
[02:46:38.890 --> 02:46:39.610]  I appreciate the call.
[02:46:39.891 --> 02:46:42.773]  Going back to Chris Floyd on that issue, two issues he brought up there.
[02:46:43.273 --> 02:46:52.201]  Everything they've accused Saddam of, which our government helped put him in power to do, they've now done in spades, whether it's death squads, torture camps, rape rooms.
[02:46:52.581 --> 02:46:56.785]  And then the second thing that the caller was bringing up there,
[02:46:58.044 --> 02:47:02.747]  That made me think of the fact that the real terrorists are the people that overthrew our Constitution.
[02:47:03.028 --> 02:47:04.429]  They're really the usurpers.
[02:47:04.469 --> 02:47:09.152]  This administration, they're the revolutionary aliens to our form of government.
[02:47:09.192 --> 02:47:09.672]  Chris Floyd?
[02:47:10.273 --> 02:47:11.353]  Well, absolutely.
[02:47:11.373 --> 02:47:12.714]  I mean, that sort of goes without question.
[02:47:12.734 --> 02:47:19.779]  The real terrorists, you have a few freelance terrorists out there who can take pot shots now and then, and yeah, do some damage, hurt some people, that's bad.
[02:47:21.387 --> 02:47:23.528]  Throughout history, the real terrorism has been state terrorism.
[02:47:23.548 --> 02:47:28.411]  And now we have the most powerful state in the world, the most powerful military, and it's run by people who have a terrorist mentality.
[02:47:28.431 --> 02:47:32.233]  And as you, as the caller said, I mean, of course, Hussein and Bush have done the same things.
[02:47:32.293 --> 02:47:38.176]  And Bush, having more power and more money, has done, you know, at a different level of magnitude.
[02:47:38.557 --> 02:47:39.737]  Because it's what we're talking about.
[02:47:40.058 --> 02:47:41.138]  Because they want the same thing.
[02:47:41.158 --> 02:47:48.282]  They wanted unrestricted power to do what they want, and to bloat their cronies, you know, gorge their cronies with goods, and wield dominion over other people.
[02:47:48.322 --> 02:47:49.583]  So they do the same sort of things.
[02:47:50.495 --> 02:47:52.236]  Having more power does it at a greater magnitude.
[02:47:52.276 --> 02:47:57.538]  I mean, we know that Bush in the last three years has killed at least 250,000 Iraqi civilians.
[02:47:57.578 --> 02:48:04.821]  I mean, this is... I mean, sometimes I myself, you know, we throw these numbers around and we just don't, you know, let them sink in.
[02:48:04.861 --> 02:48:06.782]  But I mean, it's just staggering.
[02:48:06.802 --> 02:48:11.924]  It's just, you know, it's... And so the level of crime is just staggering like that.
[02:48:12.484 --> 02:48:12.804]  You're right.
[02:48:14.825 --> 02:48:16.826]  And we're talking about very cold-blooded people.
[02:48:16.946 --> 02:48:19.607]  I mean, some of the Americans think we're getting power in Iraq.
[02:48:19.687 --> 02:48:20.987]  We're part of the fun.
[02:48:21.027 --> 02:48:22.027]  We're part of the empire.
[02:48:22.647 --> 02:48:27.469]  The very people that think nothing of Iraqi women and children do not care about you, America.
[02:48:27.489 --> 02:48:30.530]  I mean, they could care less about you.
[02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:38.732]  And every ruling, every action, every law, everything that's being done is about raping the living daylights out of you financially.
[02:48:38.752 --> 02:48:41.273]  That's just so sick.
[02:48:41.333 --> 02:48:42.594]  Final segment with Chris Floyd.
[02:48:42.634 --> 02:48:43.594]  Final segment, period.
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:54.321]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.681 --> 02:49:02.343]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.023 --> 02:49:10.064]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.465 --> 02:49:17.346]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.853 --> 02:49:21.934]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.194 --> 02:49:25.695]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.155 --> 02:49:28.076]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.416 --> 02:49:32.337]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.543 --> 02:49:50.646]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:50.706 --> 02:49:58.011]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:49:58.151 --> 02:50:08.778]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:50:08.998 --> 02:50:13.521]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:50:13.821 --> 02:50:18.807]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:50:19.007 --> 02:50:21.951]  Yes, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.191 --> 02:50:32.002]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:51:48.921 --> 02:51:50.723]  Final segment, two final calls.
[02:51:50.823 --> 02:51:53.405]  Jonathan in Texas, you're on the air with Chris Floyd.
[02:51:53.425 --> 02:51:53.805]  Go ahead.
[02:51:55.427 --> 02:51:58.570]  Hi Alex, I'm calling from the University of Texas, San Antonio down here.
[02:51:58.810 --> 02:51:59.510]  Yes sir, welcome.
[02:52:01.031 --> 02:52:03.874]  We started a student organization down here, Students for 9-11 Truth.
[02:52:04.694 --> 02:52:07.917]  We started this Monday and we've had really good support down here.
[02:52:07.957 --> 02:52:12.280]  We have about, I don't know, about 120 people on our mailing list, about 60 members so far.
[02:52:13.221 --> 02:52:15.483]  And next week we're going to be handing out a Terror Storm DVDs.
[02:52:15.503 --> 02:52:17.464]  Awesome, thank you!
[02:52:18.485 --> 02:52:18.985]  No problem.
[02:52:19.986 --> 02:52:21.808]  Just doing whatever we can to get the word out.
[02:52:22.949 --> 02:52:24.630]  But we've been educating people, we've been
[02:52:25.063 --> 02:52:26.784]  Putting posters up and telling people about HR 6166.
[02:52:28.665 --> 02:52:30.706]  It's amazing how many people don't know about it.
[02:52:32.247 --> 02:52:33.347]  Well, we need to repeal it.
[02:52:33.367 --> 02:52:38.290]  You know, Bush got total blanket liability protection passed for the vaccine makers.
[02:52:38.330 --> 02:52:39.330]  We made them repeal that.
[02:52:39.831 --> 02:52:45.733]  Once people find out it was, they spun it that it was a defeat of Bush and in truth it was a total empowerment.
[02:52:45.994 --> 02:52:48.535]  Chris Floyd, what do you think of that smoke and mirrors trick?
[02:52:49.116 --> 02:52:49.897]  Well, absolutely.
[02:52:49.977 --> 02:52:51.017]  I mean, he's absolutely right.
[02:52:51.298 --> 02:52:52.478]  People don't know anything about it.
[02:52:53.039 --> 02:52:53.899]  They wasn't reported.
[02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:55.801]  As you said, it wasn't reported for what it was.
[02:52:56.301 --> 02:53:02.446]  It was reported as the tail end of this sham negotiation between McCain and all these, you know, McCain and Warner and Bush.
[02:53:03.146 --> 02:53:08.530]  Again, even if that was real, we'd have a small sliver of the elite trying to decide, you know, how much liberty we can have.
[02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:10.832]  But that was just a sham in the first place.
[02:53:11.332 --> 02:53:12.733]  And so, no, no one knows about it.
[02:53:12.793 --> 02:53:18.077]  But as you say, if it somehow could be made to know what's going on, I don't know, you know, if the Democrats had just
[02:53:18.502 --> 02:53:22.727]  If the Democrats in the Senate would stage a one-day strike and say, look, we're not doing any business today.
[02:53:22.747 --> 02:53:23.968]  Of course, the Senate is now closed.
[02:53:24.068 --> 02:53:27.212]  It would have called attention to this sort of thing, but they wouldn't do that.
[02:53:27.232 --> 02:53:29.614]  They just stood up on the day of the bill.
[02:53:29.634 --> 02:53:34.940]  They made a few fine speeches that they should have been making for the last five years, and they wouldn't even filibuster the bill.
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:35.681]  And he's right.
[02:53:35.741 --> 02:53:39.145]  No one knows what the import of the bill is, because, of course, the next day,
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.521]  It happened on Thursday and the next day was, you know, Friday Night Football and that was the weekend.
[02:53:43.781 --> 02:53:44.041]  Sure.
[02:53:44.121 --> 02:53:45.321]  Jonathan, keep it up.
[02:53:45.341 --> 02:53:48.222]  I want to know more about 9-11 Truth in San Antonio.
[02:53:48.682 --> 02:53:50.002]  We want to get you down here sometime.
[02:53:50.702 --> 02:53:51.563]  Help us out down here.
[02:53:51.823 --> 02:53:59.104]  Well, I'd love to try to do that, but just get a website, get some organization together and you can certainly plug it here.
[02:53:59.144 --> 02:53:59.504]  Thank you.
[02:54:00.064 --> 02:54:01.505]  And thanks for handing out tariffs for them.
[02:54:01.545 --> 02:54:03.145]  I need people's help getting it out.
[02:54:03.285 --> 02:54:05.065]  Evan in Florida, last caller, go ahead.
[02:54:05.766 --> 02:54:06.766]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:54:06.946 --> 02:54:07.266]  Good, sir.
[02:54:07.717 --> 02:54:08.858]  I got two things to say.
[02:54:09.158 --> 02:54:12.842]  The first one is, so if you were to leave America, where would you go?
[02:54:12.862 --> 02:54:14.464]  Well, no, that's my point.
[02:54:14.504 --> 02:54:16.346]  There's nowhere to run.
[02:54:17.387 --> 02:54:19.529]  It's that serious, folks.
[02:54:19.749 --> 02:54:20.870]  That's how bad this is.
[02:54:21.991 --> 02:54:23.432]  So we're all sort of stuck here.
[02:54:23.452 --> 02:54:26.776]  I don't even think we could leave if we tried.
[02:54:28.231 --> 02:54:36.297]  Well, no, for now, but after Bush nukes the city and blames it on Iran, or releases smallpox or something, Lord knows what they'll do, then things can get real serious.
[02:54:36.497 --> 02:54:37.258]  That's the whole point.
[02:54:37.698 --> 02:54:44.483]  Chris Floyd, I mean, do you think I'm exaggerating, or do you think we're in danger of going into a total Nazi-type state?
[02:54:45.023 --> 02:54:46.845]  Well, I think that's a genuine risk.
[02:54:46.865 --> 02:54:51.228]  I mean, absolutely, it's a risk, because as we said before, there's structures in place if they want to push it that far.
[02:54:51.268 --> 02:54:55.031]  And you're right about... I live in England right now for family reasons, but
[02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:58.022]  Yes, it's even worse over here in some degrees.
[02:54:58.082 --> 02:55:00.424]  I mean, they have incredible draconian powers over here.
[02:55:00.665 --> 02:55:04.429]  And they basically outlaw protest over here if they want to outlaw it.
[02:55:04.589 --> 02:55:06.051]  You can't get three people together.
[02:55:06.091 --> 02:55:10.916]  And if you press, like I said, a leaflet on someone twice, they can arrest you for harassment over here.
[02:55:10.956 --> 02:55:13.739]  So, yeah, I mean, that's the real trouble.
[02:55:13.859 --> 02:55:16.342]  Well, now they're banning leaflets saying they're bad for the environment.
[02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:18.061]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:55:18.081 --> 02:55:21.945]  I mean, you know, whatever trick, you know, uh, whatever trick they can pull, that's what they'll do.
[02:55:22.005 --> 02:55:25.209]  Hey, I was all over London and cops would walk over and go, turn your cameras off.
[02:55:25.229 --> 02:55:26.370]  You're not allowed to videotape.
[02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:28.112]  You've got cameras everywhere watching me.
[02:55:28.572 --> 02:55:29.173]  Well, absolutely.
[02:55:29.193 --> 02:55:33.397]  Well, I was in the Soviet Union in early 1980 for a visit and it's the same sort of thing now.
[02:55:33.437 --> 02:55:34.098]  Don't take pictures here.
[02:55:34.118 --> 02:55:34.798]  Don't take pictures there.
[02:55:34.818 --> 02:55:35.239]  Don't do this.
[02:55:35.299 --> 02:55:35.759]  Don't do that.
[02:55:35.779 --> 02:55:37.801]  You know, that's the same sort of thing that's coming.
[02:55:37.821 --> 02:55:38.082]  So, um,
[02:55:39.915 --> 02:55:41.236]  All right, thank you for the call, Evan.
[02:55:41.256 --> 02:55:41.897]  Sorry we're out of time.
[02:55:42.157 --> 02:55:44.440]  Chris Floyd, I want to have you back on again.

[02:55:47.863 --> 02:55:49.464]  And the blog is Empire Burlesque.
[02:55:49.484 --> 02:55:51.106]  Just type Chris Floyd into Google, you'll find it.

[02:55:55.250 --> 02:55:56.191]  Godspeed, my friend.

[02:55:58.813 --> 02:55:59.374]  Have a great evening.
