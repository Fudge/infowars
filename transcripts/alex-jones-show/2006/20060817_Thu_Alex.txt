[00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:06.363]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.083]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:09.903]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.344]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:13.004]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:17.325]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:21.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:34.605]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.666]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:42.410]  It is the 17th of August, 2006.
[00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.632]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.452 --> 00:01:00.983]  We'll get into all the fear-mongering that Alberto Gonzalez and Michael Chertoff, both dual citizens of different countries, are doing to scare the population into accepting a new reign of total terror and control.
[00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:09.440]  More on my prediction of government-sponsored terror by late October, unless we warn the world, which is now starting to happen.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.941]  Good job.
[00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:10.761]  Keep it up, folks.
[00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:18.766]  Also, what the supposed ceasefire is doing over in the Middle East, in Lebanon and northern Israel.
[00:01:20.627 --> 00:01:27.351]  Coming up in the second hour, really, the American Union news has gotten off of the front burner, unfortunately.
[00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:40.912]  and the fact that uh... the census reports that cities like new york are sixty plus percent foreigners and illegal aliens and almost every other major city in the u.s.
[00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:56.457]  is majority foreigner that trends only accelerating not decelerating or reversing and how that ties into his freedom of information act request and some of the documents he's gotten some of the documents they've refused to give Jerome Corsi
[00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.558]  in his fight to expose the American Union.
[00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:13.808]  You see, I've been trying to expose the American Union for 12 years and we've had, oh, it's got to be 30, 40, 50 guests on just the last couple years on the subject, but a lot of people didn't pay attention to us.
[00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:25.736]  You know, we talk about the Federal Reserve being private and vaccines being bad for you and most conservative leaders not really being conservative, so the La La Land fake conservatives won't listen to us, but
[00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:53.190]  When a neocon lord like Jerome Corsi finally reads the documents and decides to do reports on it, finally America now admits it's real and going on, and Lou Dobbs, an establishment type, admits it's going on, and Glenn Beck admits it's going on, and the Associated Press admits it's going on, well then we can finally have a real discussion.
[00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.931]  The U.S.
[00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:54.331]  is being
[00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.268]  Broken up, right now, officially.
[00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.549]  Still, the general public isn't aware of it, but some are learning of it.
[00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.031]  And so that's coming up in the second hour, and there's been a lot of new things he's learned, a lot of big stories he's been breaking.
[00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.292]  He's doing some good work on that subject, and so Mr. Corsi will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:14.272]  Then, Jonathan Mosley,
[00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:22.861]  His family runs one of the biggest neocon publishing houses in the country.
[00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.742]  They're the folks that put out the Swift Boat books.
[00:03:27.742 --> 00:03:29.082]  Again, I'm not for Kerry, folks.
[00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:31.783]  I'm just pointing out this guy's tied in with these operatives.
[00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:45.787]  Jonathan Mosley wrote a really venomous, savage hit piece against myself and others, and said some things in here that I don't think will stand up to scrutiny.
[00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:59.804]  9-1-1 Bush Bashers is his archetypal neocon hit piece against me, where I'm called the key conspiracy leader.
[00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:07.390]  I've run the whole thing and I'm particularly un-American and disgusting and horrible and profane.
[00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:10.907]  Says, I'm profaning the deaths of the 3,000.
[00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:19.273]  Well, if I was one of the 3,000 that was killed, I'd want those that killed me to be brought to justice, whether you even believe the official story.
[00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.454]  It's Osama Bin Laden.
[00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:22.195]  They say they're not looking for him anymore.
[00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:25.497]  Number three at the CIA says they don't want him.
[00:04:25.517 --> 00:04:28.179]  Of course, he didn't carry out the attacks.
[00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:29.600]  He couldn't carry out the attacks.
[00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:35.405]  But the point is, this feller will be joining us in the third hour.
[00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:40.820]  So we'll be talking to him.
[00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:46.364]  And I'm going to try to be controlled.
[00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:47.585]  We'll see.
[00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:53.289]  I've normally got my tie loosened by the third hour.
[00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.771]  It's the fire breathing hour.
[00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.433]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.794]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.134 --> 00:05:10.076]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:18.102]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:25.808]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:33.094]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:37.628]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:41.468]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.829]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.090]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:07.616]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:12.061]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:12.901]  We listened.
[00:06:13.202 --> 00:06:18.186]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:18.947]  We listened.
[00:06:19.327 --> 00:06:22.370]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.331]  We listened.
[00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:27.315]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:06:27.455 --> 00:06:28.475]  We're good to go.
[00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:46.983]  Get the Perky Lite, the American water purifier.
[00:06:47.183 --> 00:06:47.363]  Only $279.
[00:06:47.423 --> 00:06:48.024]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.084 --> 00:06:48.424]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.464 --> 00:06:49.845]  Or order on the web at perkywater.com.
[00:06:49.885 --> 00:06:50.925]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.808 --> 00:07:07.590]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.031]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:15.272]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing our rights.
[00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:17.233]  Today, you can take this stand.
[00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:22.735]  You can express your beliefs by wearing a new and innovative t-shirt available only through GCN.
[00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:28.716]  Each shirt is black, with a redesign of the famous Don't Tread on Me Gaston flag located on the front of the shirt.
[00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:30.557]  On the back is the Bill of Rights.
[00:07:30.937 --> 00:07:31.438]  I think so.
[00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:07.157]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:26.683]  Alright, coming up in the third hour today, we have Jonathan Mosley wrote this really vicious 9-11 hit piece on my shelf and others.
[00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:30.651]  And I appreciate him having the courage to come on the show.
[00:08:31.231 --> 00:08:34.693]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:08:34.713 --> 00:08:38.055]  We will have open phones during the broadcast as well.
[00:08:38.195 --> 00:08:41.717]  I want to talk some about the American Union and the open borders.
[00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:52.523]  We've been so busy talking about government stage terror attacks that are looming and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East that we're not really looking at
[00:08:53.982 --> 00:09:00.467]  The public signing of the Security and Prosperity Partnership and what that means to our society.
[00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:04.971]  Here are some of the latest articles out on the subject, just from Human Events alone.
[00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:10.555]  North American Trusted Trader begins rolling out on the NAFTA Super Corridor.
[00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:17.461]  In the Trusted Traders, that is an American Union ID Pass for Canada, the U.S.
[00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:17.981]  and Mexico.
[00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:20.523]  That is your American Union ID Card.
[00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:27.556]  21st Century Slave Trade, the Guest Worker Amnesty, we'll be getting into that report.
[00:09:28.617 --> 00:09:32.420]  China Wins NAFTA Superhighway Battle.
[00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:42.669]  And we'll get more into the La Reconquista Movement, Mexico's plan for the American Southwest from their own statements, from their own admissions.
[00:09:47.618 --> 00:09:56.845]  In a minute though, I'm going to get into Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez is saying that literally terrorists are everywhere and that they are just on the verge.
[00:09:57.525 --> 00:09:58.566]  They're in every neighborhood.
[00:09:58.626 --> 00:09:59.767]  They're preparing to strike.
[00:10:00.307 --> 00:10:01.188]  Just get ready.
[00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:03.229]  It's total doom, total destruction.
[00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:14.137]  I talked to a family friend yesterday and I'm not supposed to tell you the name of the funeral home
[00:10:15.146 --> 00:10:18.268]  I'm not supposed to tell you any of the details.
[00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:25.774]  People just like to tell me stuff like this and then say that we've all got to basically cower down and let it all happen.
[00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:28.916]  As if that's going to stop anything.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:37.585]  Because, and again, people will freely admit all this and then tell you that, oh, no, it's okay, you can tell people about this.
[00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:38.706]  It's not secret.
[00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:47.431]  But Americans today, even people that I know personally, for many years, still feel like, well, that you're just not supposed to talk about it.
[00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:51.714]  You're not supposed to talk about horrible things when you confirm it.
[00:10:52.592 --> 00:11:01.663]  It has to do with the plan here in Austin and every other major city to put the dead bodies in the makeshift morgue.
[00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:08.450]  And can you guess what the makeshift morgue is going to be after the terror attack they say that is sure to happen?
[00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:13.156]  It is the North Cross Mall ice skating rink.
[00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:19.075]  And a lot of you just tuned in and you're saying, what are you talking about Alex Jones?
[00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:25.941]  Well, I'll tell you a little bit later after we cover some news in this hour exactly what I'm getting at here.
[00:11:25.961 --> 00:11:38.813]  I want to give you time to call your friends and family and your co-workers and your neighbors and tell them to tune in right now whether you're listening on an AM or FM station, shortwave, the internet, or satellite.
[00:11:41.008 --> 00:11:45.609]  Because this is important and it meshes in with all the other data I have in front of me.
[00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.471]  And I've already independently confirmed what you're going to hear.
[00:11:52.311 --> 00:12:09.937]  But it's just when you then get it even in your town you live in, when you hear the type of stuff that you've read that's been going on nationally, it just lets you know how serious the globalists are and what they'd like to do to you and your family.
[00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:21.596]  The world is going to be a-changin' in a big way, for the worse, unless we get the word out about the bad people that are running our government.
[00:12:21.796 --> 00:12:29.724]  And, you know, the neocon zombie followers seem to think it's because we hate George Bush.
[00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:33.008]  And, yeah, they're right to a certain extent.
[00:12:33.863 --> 00:12:52.591]  The crust, the very thin veneer at the surface, I mean I don't like George Bush, I don't like Bill Clinton, I detest people like Hillary and Chuckie Schumer and folks of that ilk, but I mean I hate all puppets of the New World Order.
[00:12:54.217 --> 00:12:59.159]  I detest elitists that can care less about our freedoms and our futures.
[00:12:59.239 --> 00:13:08.401]  But no, it's not because we're all evil, mindless, Democrat liberals that we just mindlessly hate George Bush.
[00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:09.702]  I mean, I hear these callers.
[00:13:09.782 --> 00:13:16.704]  I heard one this morning on a national neocon show with a voice just like this, I just don't understand it.
[00:13:16.784 --> 00:13:21.685]  Bush is trying to save America and these evil Bush haters
[00:13:22.922 --> 00:13:24.103]  They just are horrible.
[00:13:24.883 --> 00:13:26.645]  And they don't want to defend our country.
[00:13:26.745 --> 00:13:28.766]  I don't know why they want to bring it down.
[00:13:29.646 --> 00:13:37.211]  And I just don't know how they don't see how the great man George Bush is and everything he's doing to defend our country.
[00:13:38.052 --> 00:13:45.517]  And I just, you know, these liberals out there like Jimmy Carter, they just want to bring this country down.
[00:13:45.577 --> 00:13:47.038]  They just need to shut up.
[00:13:47.378 --> 00:13:48.719]  They're aiding Al Qaeda.
[00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:57.331]  I learned yesterday from two separate eyewitnesses that two different national radio shows were equating my shelf with Al-Qaeda.
[00:13:58.011 --> 00:13:59.333]  One of them, Laura Ingram.
[00:14:01.414 --> 00:14:02.675]  Yeah, Alex Jones!
[00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:05.958]  He's got the same mindset as Al-Qaeda!
[00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:15.186]  One of my employees, one of my officers in the fight against the New World Order heard this.
[00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:17.428]  He's just flipping around the radio at lunch and there it is.
[00:14:19.352 --> 00:14:22.715]  And then I talked to another friend who heard it on a separate show.
[00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:29.821]  So they get their daily talking points, I guess, and... That Alex Jones, he's with Al Qaeda!
[00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.865]  And there are hit pieces out there, over and over again.
[00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.807]  This is how we aid Al Qaeda, see?
[00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:37.508]  We're really...
[00:14:38.388 --> 00:14:45.475]  We're really announcing the government's going to launch a terror attack so that when Al-Qaeda strikes the U.S.
[00:14:46.756 --> 00:14:49.438]  Al-Qaeda's in control of us, you see, according to the media now.
[00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:55.624]  So when Al-Qaeda hits the United States, we'll think it's Bush.
[00:14:55.924 --> 00:14:56.384]  Yes!
[00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:56.805]  Oh!
[00:14:57.635 --> 00:15:00.576]  Absolutely, that's, that, boy, you've caught us now.
[00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:03.536]  Hold on, hold on, I'm, ring, ring, I'm getting a call.
[00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:04.997]  Yes, Mr. Bin Laden.
[00:15:05.757 --> 00:15:10.198]  What am I, oh, okay, say Bush is going to carry out the terror attack.
[00:15:10.518 --> 00:15:12.339]  Why, why, why, Mr. Bin Laden?
[00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:15.239]  Oh, really, sir?
[00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:17.860]  Oh, because then we'll blame it on him.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.200]  Oh, you're such a genius.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.281]  Oh, thank you.
[00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:21.661]  Oh, yes, worshipful.
[00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:23.321]  Oh, thank you, master.
[00:15:23.341 --> 00:15:26.222]  Oh, click, oh, I talked to my master.
[00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:28.329]  I mean, come on!
[00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:47.575]  But this is their new tactic, and believe me, a lot of the general public is so, not even dumbed down, they're so focused on mindlessness, they're so focused on baloney, their brains are so filled with disinformation, and they associate their whole psyche with the disinfo.
[00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.636]  That's who they are, that's their identity.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:57.304]  That they hear that I'm with Al-Qaeda, folks, and they hear that I'm supporting Al-Qaeda, they believe it!
[00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:00.487]  Oh, that Alex Jones!
[00:16:00.567 --> 00:16:01.367]  I heard about him!
[00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:03.969]  He's the one that's with Al-Qaeda!
[00:16:03.989 --> 00:16:08.052]  You know, I wasn't joking over the years when I kept saying, you know, you're for freedom, you're with Al-Qaeda!
[00:16:09.493 --> 00:16:18.419]  Now, whenever you complain about a warrantless break into your house, or the police rubber-bulleting an innocent crowd, they now just say, well, you know, it's post-9-11.
[00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:21.812]  We need to do this to keep you safe.
[00:16:21.892 --> 00:16:23.352]  You don't want Al-Qaeda to get us.
[00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:24.873]  You're not with Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:25.713 --> 00:16:31.476]  And then it's metastasized and warped and mutated into, you're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:33.077 --> 00:16:34.497]  Everything aids Al-Qaeda now.
[00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:37.378]  Selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes aids Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:40.800]  Homeless people sleeping on benches charge under Patriot Act.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.640]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.601]  Pot dealers.
[00:16:42.841 --> 00:16:44.381]  You've seen the national TV ads.
[00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:46.242]  Marijuana aids Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:46.622 --> 00:16:47.863]  Everything's Al-Qaeda!
[00:16:48.823 --> 00:17:00.094]  Except for those that really are Al-Qaeda, the bowels of the military-industrial complex that created these organizations, that control them seven ways to Sunday.
[00:17:01.735 --> 00:17:04.298]  We've got the evidence in quadruple-triplicate.
[00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:05.719]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.281]  But it doesn't matter to the neocons.
[00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:11.223]  They can just get in World Net Daily and just say, well, they claim Bin Laden's CIA.
[00:17:11.243 --> 00:17:33.919]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:44.043]  You see, they know people don't read today's newspaper, much less go pull them off the microfiche at the library from 20 years ago.
[00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:51.005]  And so if perception is reality... You see, the globalists know that.
[00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:52.085]  They're into hoaxes.
[00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:53.586]  They're into frauds.
[00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:56.707]  And most of their minions are well-meaning people.
[00:17:57.307 --> 00:18:01.928]  I would imagine that Jonathan Mosley, who we've got scheduled in the third hour if he shows up, and I'm sure he will,
[00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:07.330]  I mean, he probably believes all this stuff and really thinks I'm a demon.
[00:18:08.771 --> 00:18:09.571]  What's the word here?
[00:18:10.352 --> 00:18:11.072]  Profane.
[00:18:12.252 --> 00:18:15.434]  I'm profaning the memory of the 3,000 victims.
[00:18:16.634 --> 00:18:17.195]  No, I'm not.
[00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:19.496]  And the evidence shows I'm not.
[00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:20.716]  I'm trying to save lives.
[00:18:22.677 --> 00:18:26.399]  Because the people that did 9-11 are going to keep on doing it as long as we give them power out of it.
[00:18:28.881 --> 00:18:34.246]  Later in the show, I got about a four-minute clip that a caller called in about this yesterday and I'd read about it, I hadn't seen it.
[00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:51.300]  Last night I came across the local newscast of peaceful protesters not doing anything wrong, peacefully gathered, and the police department there in Florida just start shooting them with rubber bullets and laughing while they do it.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.464]  And then the deputy police chief's in there, one of the top captains,
[00:18:57.413 --> 00:18:59.214]  And he's just having a huge celebration.
[00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:00.474]  He's saying, good job team.
[00:19:00.494 --> 00:19:03.015]  It was funny how you shot that woman in the face.
[00:19:03.836 --> 00:19:04.396]  Good job!
[00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:08.598]  And then, he does it right in front of a whole tent of news cameras.
[00:19:09.038 --> 00:19:11.499]  I mean, they have public celebrations now.
[00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:14.920]  About, and you can go watch the video.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.221]  We're going to get it posted on Infowars.com.
[00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:21.563]  You can find it all over the web though.
[00:19:22.003 --> 00:19:23.423]  I was sent it in several emails.
[00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:24.684]  Thanks to listeners doing that.
[00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:35.819]  And it was humiliating to know that America has gone from land of the free, home of the brave, where cops used to step and fetch it for the American people a hundred years ago.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.141]  And they got on Mafia payroll about 80 years ago and the rest is history.
[00:19:44.103 --> 00:19:47.585]  I mean, just a giant tent of hundreds of people in Darth Vader uniforms.
[00:19:47.985 --> 00:19:49.726]  I mean, it's Darth Vader outfits.
[00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:53.088]  Just laughing about shooting a woman in the face for no reason.
[00:19:53.968 --> 00:19:55.769]  And the news puts it on and goes, this is normal.
[00:19:55.889 --> 00:19:56.069]  Yeah.
[00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.330]  Nice.
[00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:59.512]  Just keep doing what you're doing, boys.
[00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.893]  Keep doing it.
[00:20:01.973 --> 00:20:04.435]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:04.895 --> 00:20:10.459]  Did you know that Communism has stated that America would not jump from Capitalism to Communism?
[00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:19.045]  That our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America and one day we would wake up and have Socialism-Communism and not even know how it happened.
[00:20:19.826 --> 00:20:24.293]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:30.383]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism, communism, and don't even know it.
[00:20:30.483 --> 00:20:32.226]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.
[00:20:32.893 --> 00:20:40.659]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.
[00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:42.881]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:44.061]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for your subscription.
[00:20:44.081 --> 00:20:44.862]  Call now.
[00:20:44.882 --> 00:20:48.525]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:21:02.717 --> 00:21:03.759]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:09.666]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:10.728]  That's right.
[00:21:11.048 --> 00:21:13.331]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:20.821]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.377 --> 00:21:29.063]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.503 --> 00:21:34.307]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.984 --> 00:21:40.005]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:40.785 --> 00:21:44.926]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:45.546]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.586 --> 00:21:47.046]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:47.266]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.286 --> 00:21:47.566]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.746]  Move in, move in, move in.
[00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:49.066]  Captain?
[00:22:04.474 --> 00:22:05.195]  We got trouble.
[00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:05.756]  What?
[00:22:05.896 --> 00:22:07.558]  The cattle haven't had water for two days.
[00:22:07.738 --> 00:22:09.881]  We found a pond, but the cattle won't drink from it.
[00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:10.622]  Well, why not?
[00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:14.287]  Well, Captain, it's loaded with pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites.
[00:22:14.387 --> 00:22:18.552]  It's also contaminated with chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, and MTBE.
[00:22:18.572 --> 00:22:21.376]  And there's even heavy metals like lead and mercury in the water.
[00:22:21.576 --> 00:22:23.098]  Break out the Crown Berkey.
[00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:25.461]  But Captain, we've got 200 head of cattle.
[00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:29.326]  That Crown Berkey will purify 27 gallons of water per hour with 8 elements.
[00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:30.467]  You just keep it full.
[00:22:30.647 --> 00:22:31.688]  Captain, it's working.
[00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:34.312]  The cattle are drinking, and look, they're even smiling.
[00:22:41.014 --> 00:22:46.097]  Get your Crown Berkey Purifier with 2 Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $299 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:46.117 --> 00:22:46.377]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:46.437 --> 00:22:47.918]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:48.078 --> 00:22:49.498]  Not yet available in California or Iowa.
[00:23:00.894 --> 00:23:03.375]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:23:03.496 --> 00:23:05.857]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:13.001]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:23:13.581 --> 00:23:15.883]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:23:16.543 --> 00:23:20.085]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:24.768]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:23:25.328 --> 00:23:28.290]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:23:29.272 --> 00:23:32.193]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:23:32.933 --> 00:23:38.674]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:38.734 --> 00:23:42.015]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:45.676]  For the following two free reports.
[00:23:46.556 --> 00:23:46.836]  U.S.
[00:23:46.936 --> 00:23:49.837]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:23:50.797 --> 00:23:53.098]  Call 888-XANADU.
[00:23:53.158 --> 00:23:57.339]  That's 888-XANADU.
[00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:58.639]  And ask for George.
[00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:04.810]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.692]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:23.377]  Every time there is an anti-free trade open border demonstration with liberals and conservatives together, anywhere in this country, the police are ordered to go out and aim at peaceful protesters.
[00:24:24.357 --> 00:24:28.039]  We've got photos and videos of wooden dowels sticking out of people's bodies.
[00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:31.620]  Folks die every year in this country from these rubber bullets and wooden bullets.
[00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:42.019]  And you've got lawyers out in their business suits just standing there with a sign, the cops just, from about 30 feet away, shooting with rubber bullets, blood spilling out all over the place, and you can hear the cops laughing.
[00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:43.098]  Ha!
[00:24:43.218 --> 00:24:43.378]  Ha!
[00:24:43.499 --> 00:24:43.659]  Ha!
[00:24:43.739 --> 00:24:43.919]  Ha!
[00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:45.140]  Man, this is fun!
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.320]  Ha!
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:45.700]  Ha!
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:45.981]  Ha!
[00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:46.301]  Ha!
[00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:46.681]  Ha!
[00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:50.224]  People hitting the ground, blood all pouring out of their eyes in some cases.
[00:24:50.244 --> 00:24:51.085]  And the cops are, Ha!
[00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:51.445]  Ha!
[00:24:51.545 --> 00:24:51.745]  Ha!
[00:24:52.046 --> 00:24:52.326]  Ha!
[00:24:52.446 --> 00:24:52.526]  Ha!
[00:24:52.546 --> 00:24:54.047]  It's like a roar of, Ha!
[00:24:54.107 --> 00:24:54.548]  Ha!
[00:24:54.608 --> 00:25:02.915]  We're jolly green, giants, and dressed up in ring-wraith outfits, ruling the land of the cowards and home of the slaves.
[00:25:03.175 --> 00:25:03.315]  Ha!
[00:25:03.455 --> 00:25:03.635]  Ha!
[00:25:03.715 --> 00:25:03.835]  Ha!
[00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:03.995]  Ha!
[00:25:04.056 --> 00:25:04.276]  Ha!
[00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:10.231]  And then a woman tries to, please stop shooting me, puts up the little sign in front of her face.
[00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:13.273]  They shoot a rubber bullet right through it into the face.
[00:25:14.754 --> 00:25:21.820]  And then later it shows one of the police commanders going, good job men, I like to tell you, shot her right through the sign in the face.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.222]  They're all, alright, did we get a piece of redress?
[00:25:24.263 --> 00:25:25.043]  Ha ha ha!
[00:25:25.303 --> 00:25:25.904]  Yeah!
[00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:28.146]  They're in a big tent with all these news cameras.
[00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:31.529]  You see, what was done in secret is now
[00:25:32.245 --> 00:25:33.626]  Hey, we run these cities.
[00:25:33.726 --> 00:25:35.027]  Our union runs this city.
[00:25:35.248 --> 00:25:36.429]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:25:36.449 --> 00:25:38.190]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:41.813]  Half of us are on the mafia cake now.
[00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.435]  What do you think we do here in Miami?
[00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:44.575]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:49.720]  No one points out that we live in half million and million dollar houses on $50,000 salaries.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.802]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:25:52.222 --> 00:25:56.085]  When we go in the topless bars, the owner gives us girls immediately.
[00:25:56.105 --> 00:25:57.206]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:25:57.426 --> 00:25:58.968]  You live in Nazi Germany now!
[00:25:59.148 --> 00:26:00.329]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:02.594]  We'll laugh about it right in front of you!
[00:26:02.614 --> 00:26:03.734]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:26:03.754 --> 00:26:06.635]  I mean, you know, this is what corruption is.
[00:26:08.656 --> 00:26:15.118]  This mentality, this idea, this is what the New World Order is all about.
[00:26:16.418 --> 00:26:18.899]  And that's why they're training you to be slaves in the airports.
[00:26:18.939 --> 00:26:23.621]  That's why they make it ridiculously stupid to where you know it's dumb, but still you submit.
[00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:28.002]  Still you dump out the baby milk.
[00:26:28.182 --> 00:26:30.483]  Still you throw away the lipstick.
[00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:51.846]  Still, oh and by the way, we did learn, it is in the news, and they got caught, it was in mainstream news two days ago, they are selling on eBay your lighters, your tweezers, in some cases your hundred dollar pocket knives, they are selling your unopened champagne, they are selling your wine.
[00:26:52.187 --> 00:26:54.909]  Those little creatures are stealing it.
[00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:57.410]  And of course they lied, it was on national news.
[00:26:57.711 --> 00:26:59.692]  Don't worry, we throw it all away!
[00:26:59.712 --> 00:27:01.834]  And then, where is that article?
[00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:03.095]  It was in a major newspaper.
[00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:10.420]  Comes out and says, oh no, actually, the TSA, Homeland Security, now sells on eBay!
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.002]  How nice!
[00:27:14.143 --> 00:27:17.545]  See, just setting the precedent right out.
[00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:24.871]  By the way, so-called less lethal weapons, or non-lethal weapons, their true term, less lethal crowd control weapons,
[00:27:25.792 --> 00:27:29.914]  The plan is they're training the police with rubber bullets now.
[00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:31.375]  Open fire!
[00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:39.079]  These are a training aid to fire real bullets into crowds in the near future.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.184]  That's all it is and it's also training for the public to get accustomed to the images of people being hit and blood spilling.
[00:27:47.704 --> 00:27:51.246]  We remember the girl, what was her name, up in
[00:27:54.466 --> 00:28:02.215]  Up in Boston a couple years ago, oh how quickly we forget, and she just walked out of a bar.
[00:28:03.096 --> 00:28:05.238]  She was getting ready to graduate from college.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.181]  She was on the top of her class.
[00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:09.543]  They're always on the top of their class.
[00:28:09.603 --> 00:28:10.484]  I'm going to pull that.
[00:28:10.804 --> 00:28:11.605]  Guys, pull the one.
[00:28:11.665 --> 00:28:14.268]  It was at the end of a baseball game.
[00:28:15.569 --> 00:28:18.872]  And the cops called it a riot, just people wouldn't get off the streets at 2 a.m.
[00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:35.229]  They said, that's it, the bars are closed, and so everybody's leaving the bars, and here come the Darth Vader police, they've been given all this federal gear, they've been given training, and they block off a bunch of streets, and by the way, I've seen it in Austin, they don't let you get away, and then they just open fire and kill that young girl!
[00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.672]  Big pool of blood there!
[00:28:38.334 --> 00:28:43.499]  Wait till you hear these cops.
[00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:51.425]  It's so much fun!
[00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.327]  Grab them before us forces!
[00:28:53.367 --> 00:28:55.269]  It's like a bunch of orcs or something.
[00:28:55.569 --> 00:28:56.390]  Lord of the Rings.
[00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.551]  I mean you guys are really turned into animals.
[00:28:59.052 --> 00:29:03.356]  By the way police, do you think you're safe in a society where the government that lets you do this?
[00:29:03.636 --> 00:29:05.878]  Why do you think you're being trained like this pea brains?
[00:29:06.764 --> 00:29:09.845]  Because America's going into bondage.
[00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:15.667]  And you and your $35,000 to $50,000 a year, you're going to be in deep trouble.
[00:29:16.047 --> 00:29:19.568]  And your daughters and your sons are going to grow up like slaves.
[00:29:20.169 --> 00:29:26.051]  But don't worry, you'll teach them how to wear black uniforms and red armbands and salute the American Union flag.
[00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:28.491]  But still, you're not going to be in a good place.
[00:29:29.872 --> 00:29:33.233]  You're not going to be in a good place and nobody's going to help you.
[00:29:35.959 --> 00:29:36.840]  But don't worry.
[00:29:38.181 --> 00:29:43.086]  There'll be more and more riots and problems and you can gun down more girls and not get in trouble.
[00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:49.973]  You can shoot young ladies, 22-year-olds, right in the face and watch their eyes splatter.
[00:29:51.674 --> 00:29:52.575]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:54.677]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:58.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:05.900]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.281]  And check this out, I bought a new car!
[00:30:08.361 --> 00:30:13.583]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.

[00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:33.933]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.

[00:30:37.695 --> 00:30:45.161]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.

[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:40.414]  We've got this guest joining us who wrote the big 9-11 hit piece on the 9-11 Scholars for Truth and myself, Jonathan Mosley, coming up in the third hour today.
[00:33:44.048 --> 00:33:51.875]  And of course, we're going to be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.

[00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:58.422]  In about two or three minutes, I'm going to play the unedited news clip.
[00:33:59.022 --> 00:34:01.705]  By unedited, the only thing we haven't cut out is a cuss word.
[00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:03.166]  We did cut that out.
[00:34:04.327 --> 00:34:05.068]  One thing that is edited.
[00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:36.003]  uh... from the latest protests down in Miami and this has been repeated the last few years anytime they protest against the free trade area of the Americas or any of these deals the police got in trouble what three years ago because they even beat up some federal a federal judge and his wife what the cops would do is direct protesters down alleys and then just beat the daylights out of them they beat up some reporters but see they didn't get in trouble for that
[00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.771]  So now they just shoot women in the face for no reason.
[00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:41.012]  It's all on video.
[00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:44.313]  We just posted it, by the way, on JonesReport.com.
[00:34:44.953 --> 00:34:45.773]  It's all over the web.
[00:34:45.793 --> 00:34:47.794]  We've got some of our comments there in the video posted.
[00:34:48.154 --> 00:34:49.935]  JonesReport.com.
[00:34:49.955 --> 00:34:51.235]  It's not on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:51.635 --> 00:34:54.576]  It's on JonesReport.com.
[00:34:54.596 --> 00:35:01.499]  A lot of times you'll find news on JonesReport.com that isn't on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:02.939]  So that's come up in a few minutes.
[00:35:02.959 --> 00:35:04.880]  And I want to talk about this Time Magazine
[00:35:06.405 --> 00:35:10.166]  Headline, anti-terror, why we're still vulnerable.
[00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:13.247]  The same, similar headline from Newsweek.
[00:35:13.327 --> 00:35:15.447]  Newsweek, terror now!
[00:35:16.067 --> 00:35:18.588]  They want you to know this isn't five years ago, this is now!
[00:35:18.668 --> 00:35:19.808]  You've got to be afraid now!
[00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:21.669]  You've got to give your rights up now!
[00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:24.309]  There's going to be even more control now!
[00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.390]  We're going to put you in biometric lie detectors.
[00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.990]  We're going to scan your brain at the airports.
[00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.631]  We're going to search you now!
[00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:32.171]  We're going to yell at you now!
[00:35:33.812 --> 00:35:35.232]  For your own good, now!
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:39.549]  We're going to do lots of things you're not going to like now to keep you safe.
[00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.951]  Because we don't want the terrorists to get you.
[00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:43.853]  We've got to change the way you live your lives.
[00:35:44.333 --> 00:35:45.374]  Because you're not safe.
[00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:46.175]  You're in danger.
[00:35:46.815 --> 00:35:47.736]  See, that's terrorism.
[00:35:48.136 --> 00:35:50.078]  Do what I say or something bad's going to happen.
[00:35:50.318 --> 00:35:54.362]  Give up all your rights to me and don't question me or that bad man's going to get you.
[00:35:55.123 --> 00:35:55.943]  That's terrorism.
[00:35:56.184 --> 00:35:57.905]  That's the old classic definition.
[00:35:58.405 --> 00:35:59.326]  Right in front of everyone.
[00:35:59.346 --> 00:36:01.088]  They're engaging in terrorism.
[00:36:03.706 --> 00:36:21.877]  Now, even if you don't believe the criminal elements of the government are staging terror attacks, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we know that everything they're doing to quote fight it has nothing to do with keeping us safe, and everything to do with getting control of our lives, and robbing us blind, and robbing the treasury.
[00:36:22.857 --> 00:36:23.998]  Terror now!
[00:36:24.458 --> 00:36:29.181]  Someone gets into some of these articles and, Alberto Gonzales, terrorists are living in our neighborhoods!
[00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.123]  He said that they're everywhere, they could be baby bombers!
[00:36:34.597 --> 00:36:38.720]  Don't trust anyone and there's a new discovery of a new strain of H5N1.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:51.368]  I should have told you about the plan to put everybody on ice who dies from this right here in Austin using the skating rink, the ice rink.
[00:36:52.249 --> 00:36:58.993]  I'll tell you directly what we got from one of the, I'm going to say one of the, it really is the, but
[00:37:00.256 --> 00:37:05.419]  Let's say a very big national funeral home talking to one of the head honchos over there.
[00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:16.145]  Of course, we already knew this, but just to actually hear it locally from someone else who was told it by the feds, taken to a big seminar with the feds there.
[00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:21.487]  Oh, the government loves you so much they wouldn't hurt you.
[00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:24.069]  Don't listen to me, I'm bad.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.080]  I'm not patriotic.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.561]  I might be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:30.642]  Just let them get rid of our sovereignty.
[00:37:30.702 --> 00:37:34.103]  One little more gun control is actually conservative.
[00:37:35.063 --> 00:37:36.763]  Let's go ahead and bankrupt the Treasury.
[00:37:36.843 --> 00:37:37.543]  All that's good.
[00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:38.884]  Don't listen to me.
[00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:42.165]  Just the government's good.
[00:37:42.225 --> 00:37:43.485]  It doesn't lie.
[00:37:43.505 --> 00:37:46.286]  Al-Qaeda's the threat, not the government.
[00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:48.947]  Of course, it doesn't matter if Al-Qaeda really is the government.
[00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:50.027]  It doesn't matter.
[00:37:52.193 --> 00:37:59.277]  Okay, so I'll get into the plan in Austin to put the dead people on the ice rink in every other major city.
[00:37:59.297 --> 00:38:00.198]  That's your main morgue.
[00:38:01.438 --> 00:38:06.321]  And we'll then get into the fake terror alerts and play the clip.
[00:38:07.302 --> 00:38:18.088]  The clip of police having celebrations over shooting unarmed innocent women who are peacefully, legally, lawfully, rightfully, dutifully demonstrating.
[00:38:18.988 --> 00:38:20.369]  Land of the slave, home of the coward.
[00:38:21.363 --> 00:38:23.263]  Land of the shackled, home of the surveilled.
[00:38:23.323 --> 00:38:24.424]  I mean, that's where we are now.
[00:38:24.464 --> 00:38:25.484]  Worldwide known as that.
[00:38:27.284 --> 00:38:28.224]  Shut up, scum!
[00:38:28.285 --> 00:38:29.745]  You're still on the radio!
[00:38:29.985 --> 00:38:31.085]  And you shouldn't be on!
[00:38:31.105 --> 00:38:37.446]  I've had these people call in to this show, and now on my Sunday show I do on Kelby Jay, they'll call in and go, You're making all this up!
[00:38:37.466 --> 00:38:39.927]  You've got freedom to be on the air, but I don't think you should be!
[00:38:41.727 --> 00:38:43.528]  But wait, I thought you guys were for freedom.
[00:38:43.848 --> 00:38:45.468]  I think you should be taken off the air!
[00:38:46.508 --> 00:38:49.109]  But, but, but the country's still free, though, huh?
[00:38:50.615 --> 00:39:00.579]  There's lots of talk now by the neocon radio host and TV people and blogs that we should be restricted in our speech, spewing this type of sedition, I mean.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.461]  Getting up here and actually defending the Republic.
[00:39:05.862 --> 00:39:09.123]  When we've almost got it down on its knees, stop those people!
[00:39:09.143 --> 00:39:15.306]  Okay, so it's all coming up, but right now, we haven't had her on in a week or two.
[00:39:16.306 --> 00:39:17.587]  Almost two weeks, Demi Morrow.
[00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:25.258]  She takes the calls for the national manufacturer and the distributor of the Big Berkey Black Element Systems.
[00:39:26.278 --> 00:39:27.939]  And it's what I use in my home and office.
[00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:31.039]  And it is the best system out there for the best price.
[00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:33.180]  You get wholesale prices.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.080]  And it's made in America.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.662]  And they sponsor this broadcast and help us with our international shortwave outreach.
[00:39:41.182 --> 00:39:42.982]  We're always honored to have her with us.
[00:39:43.443 --> 00:39:44.843]  Debbie, I bet you've been busy lately.
[00:39:45.524 --> 00:39:46.324]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:39:46.404 --> 00:39:48.425]  I have been very, very busy.
[00:39:49.346 --> 00:39:55.228]  So busy I haven't even been able to hear what's going on with your, you know, show.
[00:39:55.928 --> 00:40:00.210]  And so I've had some of the customers keep me informed a little bit.
[00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:04.612]  Well, Debbie, we need everybody to call you right now and tell us about the different units.
[00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:08.473]  Tell us why we need a Made in America high-quality gravity fed filter.
[00:40:09.013 --> 00:40:10.574]  I think the main reason you need a
[00:40:11.378 --> 00:40:18.702]  A water filter like a Berkey is so that you can take care of yourself every single day, not wait for emergency.
[00:40:18.722 --> 00:40:33.009]  Around the 8th of August, there were 120,000 citizens in the San Diego area that were exposed to E. coli in their main water system.
[00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.410]  But that's nutritious!
[00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.791]  It's like mercury!
[00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:39.173]  Well, yeah, okay, no, it's not.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.401]  Thank you.
[00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:02.112]  When there's going to be a crack in a water main?
[00:41:02.332 --> 00:41:07.094]  Well, there's always E. coli in the water if it's a city water supply of any size.
[00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:12.756]  It's just that the high levels of chlorine kill the microorganisms.
[00:41:13.216 --> 00:41:16.497]  What do you think that chlorine does to your cell structures?
[00:41:16.937 --> 00:41:22.179]  We are a colony of cells, whereas a bacteria is a single cell organism.
[00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:29.382]  This is very toxic and very bad for your kidneys, very bad for your bladder, and very bad for your blood and your entire system.
[00:41:30.385 --> 00:41:35.627]  I mean, look, I can't stress enough that you guys got the best filters out there, made in America, at discounted prices.
[00:41:35.647 --> 00:41:40.628]  And, you know, forget there being a sewer spill, or a hurricane, or a nuke go off.
[00:41:41.008 --> 00:41:42.368]  You know, that's all the reasons to have it.
[00:41:42.388 --> 00:41:46.950]  But the real reason is, every day that water's full of trash, and it's time to stop drinking it.
[00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:47.870]  That's right.
[00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.410]  That is the main reason.
[00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.912]  And so we'd like to go ahead and, you know, get those orders in.
[00:41:54.032 --> 00:41:58.773]  And if you could just leave a message, we will gladly return your call.
[00:41:59.719 --> 00:42:02.467]  And I always look forward to talking to your listeners.
[00:42:02.527 --> 00:42:04.071]  They do help keep me informed.
[00:42:05.071 --> 00:42:09.615]  Well, Debbie, by the way, you called the office and said, are you allowed to come to our Dallas event?
[00:42:09.655 --> 00:42:10.676]  You know, you better be there.
[00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:13.679]  I was really hoping I could come.
[00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:14.660]  Oh, you bet.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.142]  Listen, we'll give you whatever seats you want.
[00:42:17.363 --> 00:42:25.670]  We'll probably take the third or fourth row, whatever a nice little prime area is, and have a few seats saved for folks like yourself.
[00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.894]  So I certainly want to see you there, nine days from now on the 26th.
[00:42:30.835 --> 00:42:32.495]  Coming up not this Saturday but next Saturday.
[00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:38.777]  Well I'm really looking forward to being there and I sure hope I get to meet a lot of the people that I speak to on the phone.
[00:42:39.237 --> 00:42:44.098]  So I want to encourage everybody to come and it's going to be a great time.
[00:42:44.498 --> 00:42:45.518]  Looking forward to it.
[00:42:45.798 --> 00:42:46.298]  You bet daddy.
[00:42:46.338 --> 00:42:47.759]  It's going to be, I guess we'll open the place about 645.
[00:42:48.279 --> 00:42:54.140]  We'll start at about 715 and we're going to show Terror Storm and then we're going to have Jim Marsh speak.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:54.740]  I'm going to speak.
[00:42:55.285 --> 00:42:58.707]  Then we're going to show footage I shot at the Bilderberg Group up until about 11.30.
[00:42:58.767 --> 00:43:02.469]  Then from about 11.30 on, we'll have a 20-minute intermission.
[00:43:02.489 --> 00:43:04.730]  Then we're going to have some great local lounge singers.
[00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:12.315]  But whether you come for three hours or all seven hours, folks, it's $10.50, and that basically lets us break even.
[00:43:12.335 --> 00:43:16.157]  We've got a very low price, and tickets are available at Infowars.com.
[00:43:16.177 --> 00:43:17.658]  But that's not why you're here with us, Debbie.
[00:43:18.038 --> 00:43:19.459]  Let me, again, invite
[00:43:20.413 --> 00:43:22.176]  Everyone to call Debbie right now.
[00:43:22.776 --> 00:43:25.841]  They're so busy and they're unable to answer the phones.
[00:43:25.861 --> 00:43:26.602]  Leave your name and number.
[00:43:26.962 --> 00:43:28.063]  They'll call you right back.
[00:43:28.504 --> 00:43:28.684]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:35.573]  Thank you.
[00:43:35.593 --> 00:43:36.074]  Have a great day.
[00:43:59.557 --> 00:43:59.857]  You bet.
[00:43:59.897 --> 00:44:02.078]  I'll see you not this weekend, but next weekend.
[00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:03.139]  Next weekend, thanks.
[00:44:03.439 --> 00:44:03.679]  You bet.
[00:44:03.699 --> 00:44:08.582]  At the Lakewood Theater in Central Dallas, right by White Rock Lake.
[00:44:08.622 --> 00:44:12.744]  It was once called East Dallas, Central East, but now it's really Central Dallas.
[00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:14.264]  Dallas has grown so much.
[00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:24.249]  I was born about four blocks or five blocks away from this movie theater, and I haven't been back to that neighborhood, even though I grew up in Dallas.
[00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:25.250]  I grew up right outside Dallas.
[00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:29.112]  I haven't been back to see that house since I was about
[00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:31.634]  Maybe 10 years old?
[00:44:31.654 --> 00:44:38.461]  So I'm going to go knock on the door Saturday afternoon before I go to the show.
[00:44:38.982 --> 00:44:40.724]  Hey, I grew up in this house.
[00:44:40.804 --> 00:44:42.165]  Mind if I come in?
[00:44:42.185 --> 00:44:43.086]  They'll probably say no.
[00:44:43.106 --> 00:44:46.510]  A few years ago I was up visiting family in Rockwall.
[00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.833]  Went back to my old neighborhood and went and knocked on the door and I said, Hi!
[00:44:51.375 --> 00:44:53.457]  I used to live here, right up in that bedroom right there.
[00:44:54.185 --> 00:44:55.708]  I guess it's a dangerous world today.
[00:44:55.728 --> 00:44:56.910]  We've been turned into evil heathens.
[00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.774]  Something people let you do 20 years ago, they won't let you do now.
[00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:11.693]  But I am now digressing, so that's not what you tuned in for.
[00:45:12.074 --> 00:45:18.138]  You can also order the Big Berkey Water Filters right off Infowars.com and we just then give them those orders every single day.
[00:45:18.458 --> 00:45:19.939]  They ship it out to your UPS grounds.
[00:45:19.959 --> 00:45:23.602]  You can also get all those filters on the shopping cart, the Yahoo!
[00:45:23.622 --> 00:45:26.924]  Secure Shopping Cart we have at Infowars.com.
[00:45:27.264 --> 00:45:29.866]  Okay, let me get back to serious issues here.
[00:45:32.205 --> 00:45:42.172]  Every year or so in Miami, if there's any type of anti-war or pro-homeless rally, where they've outlawed Miami and other cities like Tampa feeding homeless.
[00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.494]  I mean, you can't go to the park and give them a hamburger.
[00:45:45.234 --> 00:45:47.876]  They will arrest you and you'll be lucky if they don't knock your head in.
[00:45:47.936 --> 00:45:48.597]  I mean, it happens.
[00:45:49.878 --> 00:45:52.099]  When you've got a mafia-run police department, this happens.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:58.924]  It's always worse in places like Chicago and New York and Houston and Miami and places like that.
[00:46:02.103 --> 00:46:09.966]  If you don't have a computer and can't go to JonesReport.com and watch this, this is just a few days ago, a repeat of what's happened in the past.
[00:46:11.527 --> 00:46:20.290]  This is ABC News, interspersed with some activist footage, and this happened again just a few days ago.
[00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:25.172]  Well, I guess it'd be seven days ago.
[00:46:26.258 --> 00:46:32.140]  And there's a nice woman lawyer sitting there who they shoot once and she's complaining, why are you shooting me?
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.540]  They're just peacefully there on the side of the sidewalk.
[00:46:34.881 --> 00:46:37.181]  And if you listen carefully you can hear the police laughing.
[00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:40.562]  And then she puts the sign up in front of her because they start shooting more.
[00:46:40.862 --> 00:46:42.583]  The sign of fear gets a wolf going.
[00:46:42.943 --> 00:46:44.083]  So they start firing again.
[00:46:44.123 --> 00:46:44.963]  She puts the sign up.
[00:46:45.244 --> 00:46:46.784]  It goes right through and hits her in the face.
[00:46:47.324 --> 00:46:50.005]  And it shows some other people blood pouring out of their eyes.
[00:46:50.689 --> 00:46:52.190]  The cops are hurraying.
[00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:57.452]  And then it cuts to the police in the big tent with news cameras all over the place.
[00:46:57.492 --> 00:46:58.513]  They know there's news cameras.
[00:46:58.913 --> 00:47:04.055]  Having a huge celebration about how they're a football team and how they went out and won.
[00:47:04.736 --> 00:47:05.496]  So go ahead and roll it.
[00:47:16.752 --> 00:47:18.593]  You shoot me?
[00:47:19.273 --> 00:47:28.294]  A lady in a suit has been walking peaceably in front of you for a half an hour and you shot me with my back turned?
[00:47:28.354 --> 00:47:29.735]  Well you all saw it.
[00:47:29.835 --> 00:47:32.735]  You've been watching me for a half an hour.
[00:47:32.755 --> 00:47:34.475]  Now you know I'm not armed.
[00:47:34.595 --> 00:47:35.756]  He shot me.
[00:47:35.796 --> 00:47:38.376]  There's this big welt on her.
[00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:43.257]  If you listen carefully, you can hear the pops of the guns.
[00:47:44.415 --> 00:47:50.959]  They're not as loud as regular firearms.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.281]  I mean, I'm scared now.
[00:47:53.701 --> 00:47:53.821]  Ow!
[00:47:54.522 --> 00:47:56.083]  What was that?
[00:47:56.583 --> 00:48:05.009]  Why did you do that to us?
[00:48:09.692 --> 00:48:11.413]  Here's hundreds of rubber bullets hitting him.
[00:48:16.357 --> 00:48:22.866]  By this point, there's just blood pouring.
[00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.015]  You okay?
[00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.075]  You okay?
[00:48:32.135 --> 00:48:33.356]  You okay?
[00:48:33.796 --> 00:48:36.578]  Don't get around me, Mucky.
[00:48:36.718 --> 00:48:40.081]  Let them see it.
[00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:42.802]  Hit her in the face!
[00:48:43.203 --> 00:48:50.467]  Hit her in the face!
[00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:55.991]  So basically, it's police in Darth Vader outfits.
[00:48:58.027 --> 00:49:00.468]  Oh, that one right here?
[00:49:00.488 --> 00:49:02.510]  Put it on your website.
[00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.930]  Oh yeah, hit pause.
[00:49:04.791 --> 00:49:05.291]  Hit pause.
[00:49:05.932 --> 00:49:06.312]  Right there.
[00:49:06.332 --> 00:49:07.973]  Back it up about 20-15 seconds.
[00:49:07.993 --> 00:49:09.013]  We'll play it after the segment.
[00:49:10.354 --> 00:49:11.114]  And we'll take calls, folks.
[00:49:11.174 --> 00:49:12.935]  We're going to have unlimited calls in the second hour.
[00:49:14.056 --> 00:49:17.438]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:49:17.458 --> 00:49:22.701]  It just shows the peaceful people there with the cops now up close shooting them with rubber bullets.
[00:49:23.334 --> 00:49:27.601]  And there's other bicycle cops with them, and the people are bleeding, going, why do you do this to us?
[00:49:27.702 --> 00:49:28.403]  Why do you do this?
[00:49:28.443 --> 00:49:29.905]  Like, with humanity, going, why?
[00:49:29.985 --> 00:49:30.847]  Why do you shoot us?
[00:49:31.308 --> 00:49:34.573]  And the cops are just laughing, flipping them off, going, F you!
[00:49:34.613 --> 00:49:36.657]  We had to cut that out, but we show the, you know, video.
[00:49:37.492 --> 00:49:47.303]  Well, we actually left it on the website, but we cut it out here on the radio, and they're just flipping them off and laughing, and then they're just sitting there shotgunning them with rubber bullets, just, HA HA HA HA HA!
[00:49:47.503 --> 00:49:48.664]  But the laughing's coming up!
[00:49:49.105 --> 00:49:53.530]  You get to hear one of the police officials, just, it's a celebration of killing America!
[00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.952]  I mean, you guys would have done well in the Soviet Union.
[00:49:56.473 --> 00:49:57.594]  So go ahead and keep rolling it.
[00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:04.673]  Well, this one!
[00:50:04.854 --> 00:50:06.719]  Oh, that one right here?
[00:50:06.939 --> 00:50:10.008]  Yeah, put it on your website!
[00:50:10.653 --> 00:50:13.934]  That's all there is.
[00:50:14.954 --> 00:50:15.514]  Hit pause here.
[00:50:15.534 --> 00:50:20.315]  Hit pause here and when we come back we'll play it because now it cuts to the police in the tent.
[00:50:20.635 --> 00:50:22.115]  So they're saying, why are you doing this to us?
[00:50:22.155 --> 00:50:22.875]  Why are you doing this?
[00:50:23.355 --> 00:50:24.675]  And the guy's going, F you!
[00:50:24.756 --> 00:50:25.636]  Put it on your website!
[00:50:25.696 --> 00:50:26.316]  Ha ha ha!
[00:50:26.676 --> 00:50:27.756]  I mean, they know.
[00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:31.677]  They're like, we will do whatever we want, whenever we want.
[00:50:32.117 --> 00:50:34.017]  And these cops aren't even wearing masks, folks.
[00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.598]  I mean, it's just, you're slaves.
[00:50:37.098 --> 00:50:38.538]  It's basically like, you know, in
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.661]  The South or something with black people, where they can just beat blacks up in the street.
[00:50:43.102 --> 00:50:45.122]  It's like, we're going to beat you up and we're going to laugh about it.
[00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:49.124]  It's just, you know, this is the way it is.
[00:50:49.164 --> 00:50:50.204]  You're going to learn to like it.
[00:50:50.385 --> 00:50:51.205]  Here's my face.
[00:50:51.365 --> 00:50:52.165]  Here's your camera.
[00:50:52.405 --> 00:50:54.966]  We're shotgunning you and we're going to keep doing it.
[00:50:55.447 --> 00:50:56.987]  We're going to blow your eyeballs out.
[00:50:57.848 --> 00:50:58.188]  Okay?
[00:50:58.428 --> 00:50:58.908]  Period.
[00:50:59.188 --> 00:51:00.269]  We're going to kill people.
[00:51:00.449 --> 00:51:00.909]  Period.
[00:51:04.662 --> 00:51:05.142]  It's here!
[00:51:05.363 --> 00:51:10.126]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:18.152]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:25.898]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.298 --> 00:51:33.163]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.672 --> 00:51:37.713]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.013 --> 00:51:41.514]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.994 --> 00:51:43.895]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.235 --> 00:51:48.136]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.658 --> 00:52:02.439]  We're good to go.
[00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.030]  We're good to go.
[00:52:38.004 --> 00:52:38.324]  I think so.
[00:53:02.364 --> 00:53:02.684]  I think so.
[00:53:17.649 --> 00:53:18.249]  I think so.

[00:54:10.107 --> 00:54:20.071]  Going up on Jones Report right now, Professor Steven Jones gave us his statement on Jonathan Mosley's comments that Jones was calling for violent revolution.
[00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:23.733]  Anyone who knows Professor Jones knows how ridiculous that statement is.
[00:54:24.473 --> 00:54:28.775]  And we're going back right now into Jones's C-SPAN speech, and we've seen it many times.
[00:54:29.535 --> 00:54:32.696]  We remember he never said that, but we're double-checking that right now.
[00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:37.058]  But Jones is pretty upset about this, for as calm a person as he is.
[00:54:37.725 --> 00:54:48.008]  We do have Jonathan Mosley coming on in the third hour to talk about this unbelievable 9-11 story he wrote about myself, Jones, Fetzer, and others.
[00:54:48.068 --> 00:54:49.168]  I mean, it is savage.
[00:54:50.889 --> 00:54:51.809]  And he's scheduled.
[00:54:51.849 --> 00:54:57.191]  In fact, Kevin, I know he confirmed yesterday, but just call him and make sure he's coming on in the third hour.
[00:54:59.151 --> 00:55:01.612]  Alright, getting back to this Miami footage.
[00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:02.512]  This is the latest stuff.
[00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:03.372]  This happens all the time.
[00:55:03.392 --> 00:55:05.493]  I mean, again, three years ago they beat up federal judges.
[00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:09.702]  You know, old men, old ladies, I mean, and they got in a little bit of trouble for that.
[00:55:10.583 --> 00:55:14.067]  But now the cops know they can do whatever they want, and they're thugs.
[00:55:14.508 --> 00:55:17.392]  And so here's one of their commanders with news cameras everywhere.
[00:55:17.652 --> 00:55:18.994]  This is the disconnect, folks.
[00:55:19.655 --> 00:55:21.177]  You see, now they're doing it out in the open.
[00:55:22.192 --> 00:55:26.253]  Just bragging about, uh, hey, you see the woman with the sign?
[00:55:26.273 --> 00:55:28.433]  I love, that's why I love watching you men on TV!
[00:55:28.713 --> 00:55:33.474]  How you shot her in the face through the sign, and you hear them all laughing, and this is truly sick.
[00:55:33.534 --> 00:55:36.415]  It's like a huge tent full of people in black uniforms.
[00:55:36.435 --> 00:55:38.115]  They look like some evil army.
[00:55:38.595 --> 00:55:42.076]  And here's this, there's this commander in a black uniform.
[00:55:42.096 --> 00:55:45.456]  It's just so sick, and the things they're saying!
[00:55:45.976 --> 00:55:49.917]  But again, they think it's normal, just shooting people in the face with rubber bullets.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:54.681]  Eyeballs hanging out, blood pouring out of eyes, and they're just laughing about it.
[00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:58.522]  I mean, even cold-hearted, you know, armies, you don't laugh about it.
[00:55:59.382 --> 00:56:00.482]  It's just so immature.
[00:56:00.542 --> 00:56:01.223]  It's sick.
[00:56:01.603 --> 00:56:03.003]  This is their manhood, though.
[00:56:03.423 --> 00:56:05.264]  Shooting unarmed people or rubber bullets.
[00:56:05.504 --> 00:56:06.104]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:56:08.424 --> 00:56:17.267]  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.
[00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:27.499]  I don't know who got her, but when it went through the spine, it hit her smack dab in the middle of the neck.
[00:56:32.252 --> 00:56:39.093]  I don't know what's going to happen today, but I'll echo some of the captain's thought.
[00:56:39.133 --> 00:56:41.454]  I was on Metro Day before I went to BSL.
[00:56:41.754 --> 00:56:45.815]  This is the first time I actually got to come down here and actually be part of a winning team.
[00:56:45.895 --> 00:56:47.495]  Usually we got a round kick, okay?
[00:56:47.755 --> 00:56:48.735]  So yesterday we won.
[00:56:48.755 --> 00:56:49.796]  That's something to be proud of.
[00:56:50.056 --> 00:56:51.416]  Let's go home undefeated, alright?
[00:56:54.637 --> 00:57:00.698]  This is Elizabeth Ritter today, wearing the same red jacket after seeing and hearing the tape.
[00:57:02.048 --> 00:57:02.909]  Very disappointed.
[00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:17.869]  I was flabbergasted that an officer of the law would be trained in such a manner as to applaud and congratulate people for shooting a peaceful citizen in the head.
[00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:23.728]  Major John Brooks, who led those briefings, was made available by the department to offer this.
[00:57:23.929 --> 00:57:28.010]  We want to apologize for those remarks that were made, both about her and about the event.
[00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:32.011]  You know, to say that we're sorry those remarks were made.
[00:57:32.451 --> 00:57:40.433]  Brooks made headlines once before, riding into the van that was used to remove Elian Gonzalez from his relative's house in Little Havana.
[00:57:41.033 --> 00:57:47.155]  Elizabeth Ritter says neither Brooks nor Sergeant Kelman has called to offer her that apology in person.
[00:57:47.788 --> 00:57:49.189]  I would like to look at that officer.
[00:57:49.229 --> 00:57:54.171]  I'd like to sit down at a table the way that I'm sitting down with you now and ask, why?
[00:57:55.492 --> 00:57:56.893]  Because they're scum!
[00:57:57.653 --> 00:58:01.575]  Listen, police commanders are scared of the police.
[00:58:02.036 --> 00:58:02.336]  Okay?
[00:58:02.356 --> 00:58:06.038]  If they don't lick their boots, do everything they say, they get kicked out too.
[00:58:06.698 --> 00:58:08.539]  So see, it's all about appeasing.
[00:58:08.579 --> 00:58:09.800]  It's an animal mob.
[00:58:10.916 --> 00:58:11.857]  Okay?
[00:58:12.137 --> 00:58:12.938]  I'm sorry, folks.
[00:58:13.478 --> 00:58:15.099]  Again, I wasn't brought up to dislike police.
[00:58:15.179 --> 00:58:15.800]  I still don't.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.742]  I dislike that mentality and those type of cops.
[00:58:18.942 --> 00:58:20.863]  But that's the future of, quote, law enforcement.
[00:58:21.844 --> 00:58:23.505]  Just a bunch of wimps.
[00:58:23.725 --> 00:58:28.128]  Guaranteed, most of those guys are the type that would run away from a real situation.
[00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:31.311]  Real men don't sit around shooting women for fun.
[00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:34.933]  Let me explain that to these guys that are trying to be men.
[00:58:35.514 --> 00:58:37.235]  That's not how you're a man, okay?
[00:58:37.575 --> 00:58:39.216]  We can teach you how to be a man if you want.
[00:58:41.306 --> 00:58:45.888]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.908 --> 00:58:46.428]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.608 --> 00:58:47.409]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.429 --> 00:58:50.490]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.891 --> 00:58:56.012]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.025 --> 00:59:04.886]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.906 --> 00:59:09.529]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.769 --> 00:59:13.892]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.274 --> 00:59:20.857]  Coming up in the next hour, we have Jonathan Mosley coming on with us.
[00:59:21.518 --> 00:59:24.320]  He wrote 9-1-1 Bush Bashers.
[00:59:26.101 --> 00:59:29.524]  And I want to read part of this article before he gets on with us later in this hour.
[00:59:31.098 --> 00:59:32.378]  He calls us profane.
[00:59:32.398 --> 00:59:36.339]  He says we're profaning the memory of 3,000 victims.
[00:59:36.859 --> 00:59:44.141]  He basically claims that Professor Jones is a wild-eyed revolutionary calling for violent overthrow of the U.S.
[00:59:44.161 --> 00:59:44.481]  government.
[00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:46.481]  I've seen the tape over and over again.
[00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:47.601]  It's not on there.
[00:59:47.641 --> 00:59:48.322]  It's not true.
[00:59:49.082 --> 00:59:58.304]  Jones is real mad right now about this, and so I'm trying to... I'm trying to figure... But I talked to Jonathan Mosley.
[00:59:58.324 --> 00:59:59.324]  He sounds like a nice fella.
[00:59:59.504 --> 01:00:00.164]  I just don't know...
[01:00:00.988 --> 01:00:03.289]  Maybe he's getting it mixed up with me or something?
[01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.791]  I mean, I do say that this may come to blows.
[01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:08.151]  I mean, they're already attacking us.
[01:00:08.212 --> 01:00:10.393]  We're laying there like jellyfish taking it.
[01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:13.354]  But I'm just trying to figure out.
[01:00:14.675 --> 01:00:15.255]  Fantastic.
[01:00:15.315 --> 01:00:16.455]  What did you just say, Kevin?
[01:00:18.216 --> 01:00:19.737]  OK, well, we'll get him on five after.
[01:00:20.357 --> 01:00:27.141]  And then there's Professor Dr. Jerome Corsi, who was scheduled for the show today and then said an emergency had come up.
[01:00:28.381 --> 01:00:30.142]  And now he is coming on.
[01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:44.201]  So I told you we'd have open phones this hour, but I'm told Courtesy can only come on for 30 minutes, so we'll take calls immediately when we hit the bottom of the hour to get into the American Union, which is a very important subject.
[01:00:45.702 --> 01:00:52.186]  And there have been a bunch of new breaking developments concerning my prediction of a government-sponsored terror attack by late October.
[01:00:53.467 --> 01:00:58.170]  Some new developments there I want to get into, and again, you guys and gals out there are really getting the word out on this.
[01:00:58.570 --> 01:00:59.371]  I can only commend you.
[01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:05.770]  But without spending too much time on it, I want to get into it more later in the show, when of course he leaves us.
[01:01:08.411 --> 01:01:09.191]  This is the key.
[01:01:10.171 --> 01:01:27.775]  The criminals running the world are totally ruthless, and they need disasters, they need bird flus, they need smallpox, they need the threat of terrorism naturally occurring, or orchestrated by some group, as a pretext to get us to give up all of our liberties and go under total micromanagement.
[01:01:28.692 --> 01:01:33.213]  And I got a bunch of articles out in the last week about how that bird flu is still going to get us.
[01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:34.473]  It was supposed to kill us this winter.
[01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:37.294]  We're now coming to the end of the summer.
[01:01:38.334 --> 01:01:39.274]  Now it's going to kill us.
[01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:40.414]  Now they've started to hype up again.
[01:01:40.474 --> 01:01:41.754]  It's going to kill us this winter.
[01:01:42.314 --> 01:01:48.376]  Top scientists, the heads of major governments, you know, the head biologist in Spain is saying it's a fraud.
[01:01:49.056 --> 01:01:49.956]  That doesn't seem to matter.
[01:01:49.976 --> 01:01:52.236]  You know, Tamiflu has made a couple billion off of it.
[01:01:52.696 --> 01:01:54.197]  Well, excuse me, six billion now.
[01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.497]  Rumsfeld, something like a hundred million himself.
[01:01:57.128 --> 01:01:57.989]  That was last year.
[01:01:58.009 --> 01:01:58.870]  I'm told it's more now.
[01:02:00.692 --> 01:02:07.941]  So all of this is going on and we have the mainstream news articles.
[01:02:07.981 --> 01:02:09.683]  We have the internal documents we posted.
[01:02:11.093 --> 01:02:25.797]  Out of Pennsylvania, where in 13,000 plus counties, major preachers and pastors and priests have been recruited to tell their members, their parishioners, to turn their guns in, to take injections, to let their families be broken up.
[01:02:26.097 --> 01:02:27.178]  This is all in the documents.
[01:02:27.198 --> 01:02:29.058]  Remember, we majored in national news.
[01:02:29.418 --> 01:02:33.779]  We made a few months ago with this, and some of the preachers did the rounds out there.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.601]  And then FEMA had to admit, yeah, we're training preachers to quote, help us pacify the public.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:56.988]  Well, I've also read little blurbs about how the government and the Associated Press was reporting we're recruiting morticians and recruiting funeral homes to mass cremate and store all the dead bodies, and they told them that upwards of 150 million Americans will probably die.
[01:02:57.609 --> 01:03:03.832]  For those that just joined us or went to public school like myself, that is half the population of the United States, okay?
[01:03:04.292 --> 01:03:07.354]  That's the government saying this will happen, not might.
[01:03:07.794 --> 01:03:09.755]  I have mainstream articles saying it will.
[01:03:10.515 --> 01:03:18.379]  Well, I happen to have a good family friend who was at a major funeral home Monday.
[01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:25.142]  And I have the person's name, all the details, but I'm not at liberty to go into it, why I have no idea.
[01:03:25.462 --> 01:03:26.502]  The person wasn't hiding it.
[01:03:26.542 --> 01:03:27.463]  They were all freaked out.
[01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:29.804]  But I'll briefly tell you about it on the other side.
[01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:35.306]  Now again, we already know about this in the mainstream news, just not the full details.
[01:03:35.486 --> 01:03:38.428]  Well, they plan to.
[01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:47.764]  Take your dead bodies down and we'll tell you what we'll do with our dead bodies when we get back.
[01:03:48.505 --> 01:03:49.207]  So stay with us.
[01:03:56.435 --> 01:03:56.896]  It's here!
[01:03:57.136 --> 01:04:01.899]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:09.926]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.606 --> 01:04:17.651]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.072 --> 01:04:24.917]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:29.532]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.772 --> 01:04:33.273]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.753 --> 01:04:35.654]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.014 --> 01:04:39.916]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:56.031]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:04:56.352 --> 01:05:01.274]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:05:01.534 --> 01:05:05.876]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:06.176 --> 01:05:15.100]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.922]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:05:19.222 --> 01:05:24.268]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:31.276]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:31.756 --> 01:05:32.297]  What about you?
[01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:38.398]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:39.539]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[01:05:52.757 --> 01:05:58.038]  Dry, cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[01:05:58.299 --> 01:06:00.899]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[01:06:01.319 --> 01:06:03.900]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calyx Ointment.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.221]  It's diabetic-friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[01:06:09.462 --> 01:06:12.983]  Calyx never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:14.883]  Now they look and feel great!
[01:06:15.223 --> 01:06:18.704]  If you have calluses or dry, cracked heels, try Calyx Ointment.
[01:06:19.004 --> 01:06:21.925]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[01:06:23.376 --> 01:06:25.857]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:06:26.318 --> 01:06:28.239]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:06:28.939 --> 01:06:32.121]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:39.224]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:06:40.025 --> 01:06:42.226]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:06:42.606 --> 01:06:43.026]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:43.126 --> 01:06:44.507]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:53.047 --> 01:07:00.773]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.793 --> 01:07:17.345]  I tell you, Jerome Corsi is really an enigma to me, because Dr. Corsi is very intelligent, very informed, does great research on NAFTA, GATT, the American Union, the open borders, the Chinese, and
[01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:18.499]  We're good to go.
[01:07:37.982 --> 01:07:44.187]  He's gotten some of what he wanted, didn't get some of it, but he's been breaking some really big stories at WorldNetDaily and Human Events.
[01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:59.657]  We have links to those right now at Infowars.com and so we're honored to have him with us and we're glad he's fighting this key issue and he's about to come to Texas and be on the southern border for a month and I may go down there and videotape and cover some of what he's doing.
[01:07:59.677 --> 01:08:00.238]  I've been invited
[01:08:00.968 --> 01:08:02.689]  A hundred times by the minute men to go down there.
[01:08:02.729 --> 01:08:10.315]  I've just never had the time, but I may do it, because I want to interview Corsi about the American Union for a TV show I'm doing here locally.
[01:08:10.575 --> 01:08:12.396]  But Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.318]  Oh, it's a great pleasure, Alex, and come on down to the border.
[01:08:15.979 --> 01:08:21.162]  I'd love to work with you on a TV show that you're doing, and we'd love to have you the minute men down at the border.
[01:08:21.623 --> 01:08:23.024]  Well, I keep meaning to do it, I just...
[01:08:24.156 --> 01:08:31.042]  I don't know how upset I'll be seeing all those illegals pouring across, but hell, I'm here in Austin, Texas, which might as well be the border.
[01:08:32.443 --> 01:08:35.365]  We're bringing the trans-Texas corridor right through your backyard.
[01:08:36.146 --> 01:08:36.466]  It is.
[01:08:37.187 --> 01:08:42.771]  Let's behave as if we've got laymen joining us that don't understand the full scope of the American Union.
[01:08:43.192 --> 01:08:49.217]  Tell us what it is, what its main tenets are, how far ahead and along it already is, sir.
[01:08:49.824 --> 01:08:54.165]  Well it started really with the Waco, Texas in March 23rd, 2005.
[01:08:55.185 --> 01:09:01.247]  President Bush signed or agreed to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.
[01:09:01.807 --> 01:09:06.508]  The summit meeting with Vincente Fox and with Canada's Prime Minister Paul Martin.
[01:09:07.188 --> 01:09:17.170]  And from there it's just gone to a steady stream of government exercises and efforts to build what looks like it's going to be a North American Union like the European Union.
[01:09:17.911 --> 01:09:19.271]  And I've been focusing on this
[01:09:19.932 --> 01:09:48.108]  Department of Government, really department or division, spp.gov, that's sampeterpaul.gov, government website, and it documents, Alex, there, as you know, the 20 or so working groups that are actively today creating trilateral memorandums of understanding, a whole new network structure of North American, basically, treaty-type agreements.
[01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:48.817]  I think?
[01:10:03.382 --> 01:10:05.443]  Administrative law without a candidate, Mexico.
[01:10:05.563 --> 01:10:07.364]  And this is all about regional government.
[01:10:07.744 --> 01:10:22.009]  Already the states and the regions are breaking into their own subgroups where these unelected boards with executive authority literally are superseding local and even federal control of the Congress.
[01:10:22.109 --> 01:10:25.611]  And I had you on a few weeks ago on my local show on KLBJ.
[01:10:26.571 --> 01:10:42.436]  And since it's been in the news, can you tell us more, A, about the Trusted Traveler, which is really the American Union ID card, and now they have accompanying legislation to actually take tax money of American citizens and build the infrastructure in Mexico.
[01:10:42.456 --> 01:10:44.677]  In fact, I've got the bill here in front of me.
[01:10:44.717 --> 01:10:47.297]  This is going from bad to worse.
[01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:53.779]  Well, first of all, the Trusted Trader and Trusted Traveler is right out of SPP.gov.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.440]  And what they're going to do is they're going to
[01:10:56.010 --> 01:11:06.113]  Have some form of registration system where we'll all be given North American Union, basically, biometric border passes.
[01:11:06.753 --> 01:11:15.136]  And if you're a trusted trader, your trucking company or railroad or whatever will be able to cross the border with a Sentry electronic system.
[01:11:15.196 --> 01:11:17.717]  It'll be like going through an EZ Pass on a highway.
[01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:21.858]  And Mexicans will get them as well as we will in the United States.
[01:11:21.918 --> 01:11:25.559]  It'll completely open the border, Alex, because you'll be able to take your
[01:11:26.298 --> 01:11:27.400]  I don't think so.
[01:11:41.957 --> 01:11:44.719]  Because they've got these biometric North American cards.
[01:11:44.899 --> 01:11:50.462]  And I'm looking at a great article you wrote about this, and all your claims you hyperlinked to government documents, that's what I like.
[01:11:51.163 --> 01:12:09.534]  North American trusted traders begin rolling on NAFTA corridor highways, and this is from Human Events online, and we have a link on InfoWars.com to an archive on Human Events, a great website, where you can just see dozens and dozens and dozens of stories written by Dr. Corsi.
[01:12:11.182 --> 01:12:13.191]  Again, we run into denial.
[01:12:16.495 --> 01:12:21.218]  Now, George Norrie will talk about this with his huge national show, but very few others will.
[01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:24.080]  Even Limbaugh doesn't want to go all the way and admit this.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.221]  Hannity won't.
[01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:28.563]  The general public is having trouble believing.
[01:12:28.923 --> 01:12:39.649]  I mean, even when Lou Dobbs comes out and says, the end of America as we know it, total takeover, still I talk to mainline conservatives, they just go, George Bush wouldn't do that, it's not true.
[01:12:39.949 --> 01:12:42.471]  And I go, please look at the evidence, and they're in denial.
[01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:43.952]  Are you seeing denial?
[01:12:44.477 --> 01:12:45.258]  Well, yes, Alex.
[01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.679]  It's why I link so much to the government websites.
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.821]  I mean, every article I've been writing.
[01:12:49.841 --> 01:12:57.667]  And if you look at the book, you know, Minutemen, the Battle to Secure America's Borders, we interviewed dozens of government officials and quote them in the book.
[01:12:58.488 --> 01:13:06.033]  Now, the denial is that many Americans have come to associate conservatives with Republicans.
[01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:09.336]  In other words, they think Republicans are all conservatives.
[01:13:09.376 --> 01:13:11.117]  They think George Bush is a conservative.
[01:13:11.898 --> 01:13:13.679]  But it hasn't been the case since I was a kid.
[01:13:14.332 --> 01:13:28.660]  There always was the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party, which was the New York billionaires and billionaires and the international business people who wanted only profit and did not care about borders or the sovereignty of the United States.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:39.886]  Now that group is still strong in the Republican Party, and this idea to open up our borders and to let immigrants pour in here like an invasion
[01:13:40.552 --> 01:13:41.833]  It's a bipartisan idea.
[01:13:41.853 --> 01:13:44.676]  You've got Republicans and Democrats alike cooperating to do it.
[01:13:44.696 --> 01:13:45.537]  I need to explain.
[01:13:45.557 --> 01:13:47.759]  This is hand-in-glove, horse-in-carriage.
[01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:49.540]  This is in the SPP.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.282]  This is in the American Union Plan.
[01:13:51.682 --> 01:13:52.844]  Unlimited flow.
[01:13:53.284 --> 01:13:55.226]  We're talking about... This is in the plan, folks.
[01:13:55.666 --> 01:13:59.849]  Mexicans running the port facilities on these major highways.
[01:13:59.889 --> 01:14:00.669]  Then U.S.
[01:14:01.089 --> 01:14:03.211]  customs will be down in southern Mexico.
[01:14:03.611 --> 01:14:05.692]  Americans and Mexicans will be in Canada.
[01:14:05.932 --> 01:14:09.174]  This is the end of all three of our countries.
[01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.537]  And the new census five-year data just came out.
[01:14:12.897 --> 01:14:15.819]  Sixteen percent overall increase in legals and illegals.
[01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:19.441]  Sixty percent, and you know it's higher than that, of New York are foreigners.
[01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:21.702]  In every major U.S.
[01:14:21.762 --> 01:14:23.663]  city, the majority is now foreigners.
[01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:26.045]  Hell, they're already the majority!
[01:14:26.085 --> 01:14:27.146]  This isn't even America!
[01:14:27.346 --> 01:14:28.366]  We're already cooked!
[01:14:28.847 --> 01:14:29.647]  Well, that's right, Alex.
[01:14:29.727 --> 01:14:47.098]  And this whole idea of building this NAFTA superhighway, which is going to start in Texas next year, this Trans-Texas Corridor, four football fields wide of highway, train lines, pipes for natural gas pipelines, and oil,
[01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:56.874]  It's going to be built parallel to Interstate 35, right up from Laredo, Texas, right through Austin, through Dallas, up to the border, heading towards Oklahoma City.
[01:14:56.894 --> 01:15:05.537]  We've got trade groups like NASCO, N-A-S-C-O, look at nascocorridor.com, all one word.
[01:15:06.457 --> 01:15:15.121]  These state organizations, Kansas City SmartPorts, are going to put a Mexican port in the Kansas City inland port.
[01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:17.622]  I mean, first of all, what's Kansas City doing with an inland port?
[01:15:18.524 --> 01:15:20.670]  I was through Kansas City yesterday.
[01:15:20.731 --> 01:15:23.699]  They've got Mexico City Avenue right there by their airport.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.066]  The largest avenue going out of the airport.
[01:15:26.601 --> 01:15:29.222]  What's Mexico City Avenue?
[01:15:29.362 --> 01:15:32.804]  It's already set up, and then it bypasses the unions, everybody.
[01:15:33.285 --> 01:15:39.168]  This is globalism, where they literally carve up the infrastructure and hand it off to different foreign companies and countries.
[01:15:39.228 --> 01:15:46.852]  It's like most of the major highways in Texas will openly be run by Spanish-owned Sentra that Spanish government backed.
[01:15:46.912 --> 01:15:54.976]  I mean, we have foreign governments basically buying off our politicians and grabbing our roads, and they're going to slap unbelievable taxes on these roads.
[01:15:55.356 --> 01:15:56.117]  Well, that's right, Alex.
[01:15:56.137 --> 01:15:59.019]  You know, the people are going to vote in Texas for Governor Perry.
[01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:07.205]  If he wins, they're going to be surprised when he turns back around and he starts issuing eminent domain seizures of their homes.
[01:16:07.505 --> 01:16:10.327]  By the way, that's already happening in Eastern South Texas.
[01:16:10.547 --> 01:16:15.571]  They're already telling ranches, two miles off the road, we're taking your land, and people aren't getting fair value for it.
[01:16:16.091 --> 01:16:18.373]  Well, that's right, and they're not going to have any say about it.
[01:16:18.693 --> 01:16:21.455]  We're taking your land, not whether you like it.
[01:16:22.175 --> 01:16:24.377]  Even these meetings that are being held in Texas,
[01:16:25.776 --> 01:16:31.780]  These hearings that the Texas Department of Transportation are holding, they're not about whether or not the road's going to be built.
[01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:34.543]  They're just to show everybody the route it's coming through.
[01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.364]  The question's off the table.
[01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:37.465]  The road's going to be built.
[01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:40.911]  If I actually... And by the way, I talked to a bunch of people that were there.
[01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:45.753]  A well-known musician, Jimmy Vaughn, went and literally screamed at them and asked how they sleep at night.
[01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:55.656]  No one at any of these meetings, literally, you can have 2,000 people at these things and no one is for it, except maybe a TxDOT employee, and at the end they just say, we don't care, it goes forward.
[01:16:56.156 --> 01:16:57.696]  That's right, they're ignoring the people.
[01:16:57.736 --> 01:16:59.777]  It's like what President Bush is doing.
[01:16:59.797 --> 01:17:01.818]  The American people want the borders secured.
[01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:03.698]  President Bush couldn't care less.
[01:17:03.738 --> 01:17:05.759]  He's already agreed to erase the border.
[01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:15.030]  And the frightening part about this is when this National Superhighway connects in Mexico, it's going to connect down to ports like Lazaro, Cardenas.
[01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:19.753]  These ports are operated by the Communist Chinese, Hutchinson, Wampoa.
[01:17:19.993 --> 01:17:28.238]  All of the major ports at Corpus Christi, which is giant, it's almost bigger than the Houston ports, are going to be Chinese run, that was in the Corpus Christi collar times.
[01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:31.640]  Well that's due to me, and I know for sure in Mexico,
[01:17:32.327 --> 01:17:35.968]  And these Mexican ports... Oh no, now China's getting the Texas ports, oh yeah.
[01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.969]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:17:37.329 --> 01:17:39.510]  We've all been by the same guy.
[01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:44.912]  This Robert Pastor, who is at American University, he's been the father of the North American Union.
[01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:49.614]  He wrote the Council on Foreign Relations report, Building a North American Community.
[01:17:50.074 --> 01:17:55.696]  That report bragged it was the plan behind the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.
[01:17:56.317 --> 01:17:59.678]  And Robert Pastor is the same guy who under Jimmy Carter
[01:18:00.373 --> 01:18:10.757]  The National Security Council, and he gave away Panama Canal back to Panama, and both ends of the Panama Canal are also operated... And that was the trilateralist David Rockefeller's Big New Brzezinski then.
[01:18:11.217 --> 01:18:20.341]  That's right, and that's exactly right, and both ends of the Panama Canal are operated also by Hutchinson Wampoa.
[01:18:21.061 --> 01:18:29.444]  Now, I'm going to start writing, and I'll start it next week, some more articles on China, and documenting these slave goods that are being produced and brought up this highway.
[01:18:30.859 --> 01:18:32.320]  Well, this is the end of our country.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.361]  One more segment with Jerome Corsi.
[01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:35.621]  I want to hear about solutions.
[01:18:36.162 --> 01:18:37.362]  How do we shoot this down?
[01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:47.007]  Because they can't pass legislation to get it, so they're just ordering the different executive branches, the bureaucracies, to implement, and it's happening.
[01:18:47.467 --> 01:18:48.868]  The American Union is here.
[01:18:49.428 --> 01:18:50.789]  Jerome Corsi is our guest.
[01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:55.931]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:18:55.971 --> 01:19:07.555]  Did you know that a semi-secret organization called the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in 1921 by Marxist Colonel Edward Mandel House, who was the personal advisor to President Woodrow Wilson?
[01:19:08.275 --> 01:19:13.637]  Its objective was to capture the foreign policy section of the State Department to help direct U.S.
[01:19:13.677 --> 01:19:17.478]  influence in the overthrow of targeted nations for communism.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:22.564]  They were successful in the overthrow of Cuba and the Union of South Africa and many others.
[01:19:23.345 --> 01:19:26.869]  They control foreign policy in America this very moment in time.
[01:19:27.489 --> 01:19:36.638]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass and how they'll affect you by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:19:53.661 --> 01:19:57.562]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.762 --> 01:20:10.045]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.465 --> 01:20:10.865]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.905 --> 01:20:16.507]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.907 --> 01:20:19.108]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.968 --> 01:20:22.029]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:22.069 --> 01:20:24.910]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:31.052]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:31.472 --> 01:20:34.833]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:41.256]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:20:41.816 --> 01:20:45.821]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:46.202]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.222 --> 01:20:46.462]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:58.465]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:20:58.665 --> 01:21:00.747]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:21:00.987 --> 01:21:08.113]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:21:08.233 --> 01:21:19.763]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:27.525]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:21:27.805 --> 01:21:32.786]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:21:32.926 --> 01:21:37.927]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:42.928]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium.
[01:21:43.388 --> 01:21:44.289]  At 888-803-4438.

[01:21:48.633 --> 01:21:52.096]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:53.157 --> 01:21:55.339]  By now it is no surprise that the U.S.
[01:21:55.399 --> 01:22:00.984]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:22:01.205 --> 01:22:07.050]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become nutrition deficient.
[01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:11.123]  I think so.
[01:22:40.503 --> 01:22:42.083]  Trade, Agriculture, Law Enforcement, the Bureaucracy, Taxation,
[01:23:10.347 --> 01:23:15.711]  They're just setting it up, like they set up the Federal Reserve, like they set up all these other bureaucracies.
[01:23:15.811 --> 01:23:17.072]  They're just doing it.
[01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:19.975]  Jerome Corsi, we're going to get you back up in the next few weeks.
[01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:26.140]  You're going to be at the Texas border from September 11th until election time, drawing attention to this.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.662]  I'm definitely going to come down to Laredo.
[01:23:28.762 --> 01:23:30.243]  They're in the war-torn zone.
[01:23:30.783 --> 01:23:33.986]  State Department has stated it's more dangerous than areas of Israel.
[01:23:34.895 --> 01:23:40.037]  Issuing travel advisories, be safe, rocket attacks, machine gunnings, killing police.
[01:23:40.417 --> 01:23:41.697]  It is literal hell on earth.
[01:23:42.137 --> 01:23:45.318]  We were writing articles two years before the mainstream media finally called it a war zone.
[01:23:45.918 --> 01:23:47.099]  I'll be down there to interview you.
[01:23:47.139 --> 01:23:47.839]  Your new book's out.
[01:23:47.859 --> 01:23:49.259]  We'll tell folks about that in a second.
[01:23:49.479 --> 01:23:50.380]  And I'm gonna carry it.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:50.800]  I meant to.
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.360]  I'm just gonna call your publisher.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:56.061]  But right now, in the last few minutes we've got left, what are solutions?
[01:23:56.401 --> 01:23:58.782]  How do we stop this American Union?
[01:23:59.102 --> 01:24:01.663]  If they don't care, if there's not a law, they're just doing it.
[01:24:02.236 --> 01:24:05.678]  Well, I think, first of all, people have really got to get their minds around that it's happening.
[01:24:06.119 --> 01:24:07.580]  Because, you know, the government will deny it.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:10.762]  Tony Snow came out and said, oh no, we're not creating a North American Union.
[01:24:11.222 --> 01:24:13.944]  Well, fine, then close down SPP.gov.
[01:24:13.964 --> 01:24:19.988]  Because SPP.gov is creating a North American Union by regulations below the radar.
[01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:21.409]  They're building the roads!
[01:24:21.549 --> 01:24:22.630]  They're building the roads.
[01:24:22.670 --> 01:24:23.771]  The roads are coming through.
[01:24:24.511 --> 01:24:26.233]  The Chinese are operating the ports.
[01:24:26.693 --> 01:24:28.094]  You know, there'll be Chinese
[01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:32.389]  warships coming up the Mississippi before George Bush will admit what he's doing.
[01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:33.550]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:34.991]  See, Jerome didn't even know about it.
[01:24:35.011 --> 01:24:37.113]  There's lots of stuff that he talks about I don't know about.
[01:24:37.373 --> 01:24:48.060]  There's so much studying this every day, it's so bad that he didn't even know it was in the Corpus Christi paper that the Communist Chinese are taking over the major ports there.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.801]  No, that's news to me.
[01:24:49.821 --> 01:24:52.943]  The thing is, Alex, there's so many people working on this.
[01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:57.586]  You've got, within our federal government, the papers I've already gotten from SPP.gov,
[01:24:58.479 --> 01:25:10.141]  There's, you know, 10 or 12 different agencies of the federal government participating on these working groups, and they're just by fiat creating new memorandums, trilateral memorandums of understanding.
[01:25:10.501 --> 01:25:15.822]  They're not submitting them as treaties to Congress, but our laws are being rewritten by the executive branch.
[01:25:16.342 --> 01:25:21.943]  It's virtually a coup going on within the administration, within the executive branch of the Bush administration.
[01:25:22.263 --> 01:25:26.324]  That's what's happening, and they'll deny it until it's already fait accompli.
[01:25:27.918 --> 01:25:28.738]  That's the problem.
[01:25:28.778 --> 01:25:31.420]  People have got to speak up.
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.181]  People have got to get involved and speak up.
[01:25:35.402 --> 01:25:44.506]  Voting against Governor Perry, it's going to be, to me, astonishing if Governor Perry wins re-election in Texas with the invasion that's going on in Texas.
[01:25:44.546 --> 01:25:45.787]  He's doing nothing to stop it.
[01:25:46.487 --> 01:25:50.910]  We're building the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is already going in place.
[01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:53.571]  A million people in Texas are going to be evicted.
[01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:54.411]  You know what's going to happen?
[01:25:56.024 --> 01:25:56.564]  I'm afraid you're right.
[01:25:56.624 --> 01:26:01.286]  And, you know, again, the Republicans and the Democrats are both in on this together.
[01:26:01.326 --> 01:26:02.467]  Everybody's getting paid.
[01:26:02.507 --> 01:26:03.667]  I've written articles on
[01:26:18.499 --> 01:26:30.106]  WorldNetDaily.com, tracing the money, looking at all the money Governor Perry's campaign's gotten from the Spanish company that's financing this trans-Texas corridor, and the Texas company that's going to do the building.
[01:26:30.446 --> 01:26:37.310]  Well, the head of Perry's Border Affairs Group is a Mexican citizen, a registered lobbyist of Mexico.
[01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:39.411]  Well, that's right, and you know, they'll all deny it.
[01:26:39.451 --> 01:26:40.912]  The Kansas City SmartPort,
[01:26:41.482 --> 01:26:46.645]  We're saying, oh no, this will be, you know, the Mexican Customs Office will be still Kansas City soil.
[01:26:47.085 --> 01:26:49.306]  Well, then we had to get their internal emails.
[01:26:49.886 --> 01:26:53.948]  Their internal emails show that they have not even yet gotten the approval of the State Department.
[01:26:54.468 --> 01:26:58.750]  It might take a treaty to get this customs, Mexican Customs Office in Kansas City.
[01:26:59.231 --> 01:27:03.133]  It's almost assuredly going to be Mexican sovereign soil in Kansas City.
[01:27:03.573 --> 01:27:08.795]  But they lie to the people, even though their internal emails show that they are lying.
[01:27:08.855 --> 01:27:10.156]  They don't, they don't feel any
[01:27:10.771 --> 01:27:13.513]  compunction to come forth and tell the truth about what they're doing.
[01:27:14.533 --> 01:27:15.534]  That's what shocks me.
[01:27:16.014 --> 01:27:19.577]  Final question, how is your FOIA request going to get these documents?
[01:27:19.897 --> 01:27:27.061]  We got the first 300 pages and the attorney talked to the Linda Bell, who's doing the FOIA request in the Department of Commerce.
[01:27:27.482 --> 01:27:29.023]  They say more is forthcoming.
[01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:33.325]  I'm just expecting, they may slow play it a while, but I expect to get more documents.
[01:27:33.926 --> 01:27:37.548]  And what I've gotten right now, Alex, the United States of America
[01:27:38.157 --> 01:27:39.578]  Just out of these, erased out.
[01:27:39.658 --> 01:27:43.399]  Everything is North American this, North American that, North American everything.
[01:27:43.419 --> 01:27:47.800]  Well, you've got the documents where Texas companies are being given their new North American Union Code.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:56.103]  I've got them right in my file here where you've got a Texas corporation, you've got to apply, get your North American Business Classification Code.
[01:27:56.464 --> 01:28:00.485]  You can't use the old ones supplied by the Texas Department of Commerce or the U.S.
[01:28:00.505 --> 01:28:01.285]  Department of Commerce.
[01:28:01.305 --> 01:28:01.946]  They're no good.
[01:28:01.966 --> 01:28:03.946]  You've got to get a North American one.
[01:28:04.666 --> 01:28:05.987]  It's going to be harmonized with
[01:28:06.576 --> 01:28:07.637]  Canada and Mexico.
[01:28:07.697 --> 01:28:13.243]  Mr. Corsi, Dr. Corsi, we've got to get you back up for a full hour in the near future.
[01:28:13.263 --> 01:28:22.012]  I know you're beating yourself to death, fighting us, running all over the country, but I think the good news is we've gone from nobody knowing about this to now I'd say a lot of folks waking up.
[01:28:22.652 --> 01:28:24.594]  I think you're right, Alex, and we're just going to continue.
[01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:25.655]  I intend to keep writing.
[01:28:25.935 --> 01:28:27.277]  Tell us real fast the name of the new book.
[01:28:27.857 --> 01:28:33.838]  Uh, Minutemen, the battle to secure America's borders, and I'm co-author with Jim Gilchrist of the Minutemen Project.
[01:28:34.038 --> 01:28:35.559]  I haven't read it yet, but I hear it's powerful.
[01:28:35.599 --> 01:28:36.959]  I'm gonna definitely read it and then carry it.
[01:28:37.239 --> 01:28:38.139]  Take care, Dr. Corsi.
[01:28:38.459 --> 01:28:39.480]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.080]  We'll see ya.
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.460]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:28:43.841 --> 01:28:44.781]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.241 --> 01:28:46.901]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:50.442]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.583 --> 01:28:59.745]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.965 --> 01:29:01.746]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:02.006 --> 01:29:08.350]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:14.833]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:15.073 --> 01:29:22.557]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:29:22.937 --> 01:29:25.778]  Now available is the 2006 Biosolutions Plus.
[01:29:25.979 --> 01:29:30.040]  The Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:30.201 --> 01:29:33.762]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:34.062 --> 01:29:37.804]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:38.004 --> 01:29:40.565]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:40.685 --> 01:29:43.087]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:29:43.247 --> 01:29:45.628]  For more information call Biosolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:45.648 --> 01:29:46.148]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.155 --> 01:29:58.360]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:06.607]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:06.867 --> 01:30:13.933]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.113 --> 01:30:15.374]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:30:15.454 --> 01:30:21.358]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.538 --> 01:30:26.622]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:26.742 --> 01:30:35.628]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:30:35.888 --> 01:30:39.191]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.152 --> 01:30:43.193]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:43.333 --> 01:30:45.314]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:45.494 --> 01:30:49.437]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:30:49.497 --> 01:30:51.538]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:12.548]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.088 --> 01:31:17.231]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:20.793]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:21.754 --> 01:31:24.696]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:25.416 --> 01:31:27.498]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:27.518 --> 01:31:29.939]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:39.034 --> 01:31:39.314]  U.S.
[01:31:39.394 --> 01:31:42.295]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:31:43.276 --> 01:31:51.159]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.581]  We're going to take some calls now.
[01:31:56.661 --> 01:31:59.162]  Total screen number to join us, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:32:06.112 --> 01:32:26.737]  And then I'm going to get back into more details on how, when the bird flu is sure to hit us, the feds say, I'm not saying that, that it may kill half the population or more, and that all the major ice skating rinks are designated for the dead bodies, and one of the heads of the biggest funeral home here in Austin, nationwide it's one of the biggest,
[01:32:27.692 --> 01:32:44.296]  Uh, they went to the big seminar and they told them all that everybody's gonna be dying and martial law's gonna come in and the funeral homes will be needed to take all the dead bodies down and they'll be kept at the North Cross Mall there on the ice.
[01:32:44.457 --> 01:32:46.017]  I mean, just give me a break.
[01:32:47.248 --> 01:32:49.330]  Another one of these hoaxes.
[01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:53.854]  And don't worry, this is all a drill for martial law, a drill for federalization with the locals.
[01:32:53.874 --> 01:32:54.835]  It's all part of the fear.
[01:32:54.855 --> 01:32:56.897]  And one day the Feds will release something like this.
[01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:59.819]  They're busy killing all their top microbiologists for some reason.
[01:33:01.261 --> 01:33:04.424]  So there won't be a trail when they drop it on us.
[01:33:04.784 --> 01:33:07.306]  It is their religion to kill the majority of us.
[01:33:07.907 --> 01:33:11.690]  You can go read their own CIA docs on that and a lot of others.
[01:33:11.730 --> 01:33:12.471]  This is their plan.
[01:33:13.778 --> 01:33:18.482]  And they want to have a police state so they can orderly do this to us.
[01:33:19.383 --> 01:33:21.444]  Right now, Tony in Toronto.
[01:33:21.504 --> 01:33:22.105]  Tony, go ahead.
[01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:24.286]  Hi, Alex.
[01:33:24.327 --> 01:33:25.027]  How you doing?
[01:33:25.147 --> 01:33:25.507]  Good, sir.
[01:33:25.888 --> 01:33:26.088]  Good.
[01:33:26.568 --> 01:33:31.652]  Yeah, I was just talking to you, touch base on that police brutality thing.
[01:33:32.893 --> 01:33:34.074]  Really, this is nothing new.
[01:33:34.134 --> 01:33:41.140]  I mean, up here in Canada, in Toronto, I think it was before 9-11, we had the head of the police services or
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:46.721]  A union just openly threatening the commissioners here in Toronto.
[01:33:47.141 --> 01:33:48.121]  You know, right out front.
[01:33:48.561 --> 01:34:01.244]  Oh yeah, when a country goes bad, when a society goes bad, the police in Rome, Roman police captains, Roman generals, there'd be new Caesars every month.
[01:34:01.284 --> 01:34:03.285]  They were just taking over.
[01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:08.546]  And the head of the Praetorian Guard would normally then be the next Caesar.
[01:34:09.256 --> 01:34:12.320]  Yeah, I was the one who called in yesterday about the rubber bullet thing.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:14.302]  I was just sort of laughing around, it was a big joke.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:37.506]  All this sort of thing, but you know, people need to realize that there's a real fine line between, you know, when you give someone a badge, between a cop and a criminal, really.
[01:34:37.866 --> 01:34:38.406]  Well, that's it.
[01:34:38.426 --> 01:34:39.207]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:39.927 --> 01:34:41.509]  That's exactly what we're talking about here.
[01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:44.531]  The disconnect.
[01:34:44.551 --> 01:34:56.339]  You see, psychopaths, sociopaths, criminals, hardcore criminals are normally sociopaths, and they may break completely into total, you know, psychopath behavior, psychotic break.
[01:34:57.165 --> 01:34:58.366]  They don't feel bad.
[01:34:58.386 --> 01:34:59.527]  See, there's no empathy.
[01:35:01.289 --> 01:35:03.271]  Oh, there's peaceful protesters standing there.
[01:35:04.372 --> 01:35:07.655]  We'll just start shooting them with rubber bullets and dowels for fun.
[01:35:07.695 --> 01:35:08.055]  Oh, look!
[01:35:08.356 --> 01:35:11.839]  I mean, on this video, there's like people's eyes with blood pouring out of them.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.181]  And the cops are laughing.
[01:35:15.663 --> 01:35:16.564]  And people go, why?
[01:35:16.604 --> 01:35:17.464]  Why are you doing this?
[01:35:18.465 --> 01:35:19.046]  F you!
[01:35:19.086 --> 01:35:20.667]  Go ahead and put it on the internet!
[01:35:20.707 --> 01:35:22.089]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:35:26.112 --> 01:35:29.175]  And see, empathy is what you have in aggressive mammals.
[01:35:29.856 --> 01:35:33.439]  It's so we don't tear our own pack members to pieces because we are aggressive.
[01:35:35.461 --> 01:35:40.585]  Actually, dominant aggressive males have more empathy than even most females.
[01:35:41.446 --> 01:35:41.666]  But weak
[01:35:42.797 --> 01:35:49.663]  Child-like, arrested development, the equivalent of being an eleven-year-old, zit-faced, you know, just trying to feel aggressive.
[01:35:50.123 --> 01:35:55.007]  That's the mentality of these weak little... I see a lot of these cops in these black uniforms.
[01:35:55.027 --> 01:35:57.209]  They kind of waddle around with their knees pointing in.
[01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:58.870]  You know, they're real feminine.
[01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:01.873]  They're a little dark.
[01:36:01.893 --> 01:36:06.757]  And they need those Darth Vader outfits and all that junk they wear to feel powerful.
[01:36:06.797 --> 01:36:07.698]  These are not men.
[01:36:10.971 --> 01:36:13.533]  A man wants to fight other big men.
[01:36:13.553 --> 01:36:17.635]  A warrior wants to fight men.
[01:36:17.975 --> 01:36:19.656]  Wants to fight strong enemies.
[01:36:19.736 --> 01:36:27.601]  A warrior doesn't see a bunch of cowering hippies and start shotgunning them with rubber bullets and blowing their eyeballs out.
[01:36:28.422 --> 01:36:33.705]  We went and pulled the article and the photo of a little girl in the pool of blood.
[01:36:34.085 --> 01:36:36.006]  Student killed during post-game celebration.
[01:36:36.306 --> 01:36:38.288]  Woman hit by projectile fired by officer.
[01:36:38.708 --> 01:36:40.269]  Police take full responsibility.
[01:36:40.876 --> 01:36:41.996]  But no one went to jail.
[01:36:42.356 --> 01:36:50.439]  A 21-year-old college student died Thursday of a head injury after a clash between police and a crowd of Red Sox fans who poured into the streets outside Fenway Park.
[01:36:50.859 --> 01:36:52.039]  Now this is the original article.
[01:36:52.099 --> 01:36:54.140]  It came out then that no one was doing anything.
[01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:57.041]  They were coming out of the bars that closed at 2.
[01:36:57.121 --> 01:37:01.082]  I guess they closed at the same time in Boston as they do in Austin.
[01:37:02.043 --> 01:37:06.464]  And they just, they just, it came out that she just came out and she was walking away.
[01:37:07.373 --> 01:37:14.079]  And there's the photo that was taken by a news helicopter of a half a second before he fires.
[01:37:14.619 --> 01:37:16.661]  And there she is turning with her boyfriend.
[01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:23.847]  And there's the cop out of the line, up close, about 20 feet away, shot her right in the eye, pushed her eye right back in her brain.
[01:37:24.507 --> 01:37:29.171]  The bone behind the eye is thinner than a Lay's potato chip.
[01:37:31.493 --> 01:37:33.435]  It is paper thin.
[01:37:35.902 --> 01:37:36.282]  I think so.
[01:37:53.914 --> 01:38:05.822]  Our terminal hematoma, that bleeding underneath the skull, pushing the little brain up against the skull, crushing it as ounces and ounces of blood pour in.
[01:38:08.083 --> 01:38:09.924]  And what do these stupid meatballs do?
[01:38:14.651 --> 01:38:16.972]  In fact, there was laughing in Boston.
[01:38:17.432 --> 01:38:20.154]  At first, the cops ran over, started beating up her boyfriend.
[01:38:20.174 --> 01:38:30.678]  You know, because she hit the ground, and they all just started walking over, because that's... See, they want confrontations.
[01:38:30.698 --> 01:38:33.820]  They want confrontations in the screening at the airport.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.801]  They want confrontations on the street.
[01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:40.623]  They want to let men let them know that we're the people that run things here!
[01:38:44.031 --> 01:38:46.813]  I remember doing a lot of stories on that, and so they just kind of walked over.
[01:38:46.873 --> 01:38:48.294]  Her boyfriend was trying to fight.
[01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:48.915]  Help her!
[01:38:48.955 --> 01:38:49.355]  She's down!
[01:38:49.395 --> 01:38:50.316]  There was a pool of blood.
[01:38:50.336 --> 01:38:51.137]  You can go look at the photos.
[01:38:51.157 --> 01:38:52.137]  We're posting them right now.
[01:38:52.478 --> 01:38:53.038]  Reposting them.
[01:38:54.019 --> 01:38:55.100]  There she is in that pool of blood.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:55.920]  They're just, get back!
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.861]  They're just walking over.
[01:38:56.881 --> 01:38:56.921]  Ah!
[01:38:57.261 --> 01:38:58.402]  And they just start firing.
[01:38:58.442 --> 01:38:58.743]  Boom!
[01:38:58.783 --> 01:38:59.103]  Boom!
[01:38:59.143 --> 01:38:59.463]  Boom!
[01:38:59.503 --> 01:38:59.824]  Boom!
[01:38:59.844 --> 01:39:00.264]  Boom!
[01:39:01.225 --> 01:39:04.807]  And so she, uh, died right there.
[01:39:04.867 --> 01:39:05.988]  She bled to death right there.
[01:39:06.008 --> 01:39:10.292]  It took a while to get the, uh, aid to her, but... I talked to eyewitnesses.
[01:39:10.332 --> 01:39:12.914]  We even, uh, talked to her boyfriend, who we can never get on the air.
[01:39:13.968 --> 01:39:18.051]  About it, he was too distraught, but just about all the cops were just laughing and having a good time.
[01:39:18.691 --> 01:39:20.193]  And, uh, yeah, why don't you do this, Scott?
[01:39:20.233 --> 01:39:23.575]  Why don't you cue that clip we played from Miami seven days ago?
[01:39:24.155 --> 01:39:27.698]  Why don't you cue that back up to the, uh, cops in a little celebration?
[01:39:29.099 --> 01:39:32.601]  Can you, uh, can... Okay, go ahead and roll it.
[01:39:32.622 --> 01:39:35.924]  Now, this is the police in a tent in front of a bank of news cameras.
[01:39:37.057 --> 01:39:40.359]  Bragging about, hey did you see that woman with the sign up?
[01:39:40.379 --> 01:39:41.439]  You shot her right in the face.
[01:39:41.579 --> 01:39:43.720]  Hey do I get a piece of her dress?
[01:39:44.281 --> 01:39:45.641]  This is the new hunting.
[01:39:46.482 --> 01:39:48.863]  These guys don't go kill quail or white tail deer.
[01:39:49.103 --> 01:39:53.345]  Hey man, they go out and they blow your little girl's head off and they laugh about it.
[01:39:53.365 --> 01:39:55.046]  See, this is the mentality.
[01:39:55.086 --> 01:39:55.726]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:39:59.678 --> 01:40:08.508]  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.
[01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:17.677]  I don't know who got her, but when it went through the sun it hit her smack dab in the middle of the head.
[01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:30.315]  I don't know what's going to happen today, but I'll echo some of the captain's thought.
[01:40:30.335 --> 01:40:32.456]  I always win on Metra Day before I went to BSL.
[01:40:32.476 --> 01:40:37.060]  This is the first time I actually got to come down here and actually be part of a winning team.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:38.701]  Usually we got a round kicked, okay?
[01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:39.982]  So yesterday we won.
[01:40:40.002 --> 01:40:41.023]  That's something to be proud of.
[01:40:41.303 --> 01:40:42.644]  Let's go home undefeated, alright?
[01:40:45.399 --> 01:40:47.461]  Let's go home undefeated.
[01:40:47.561 --> 01:40:52.246]  See, this isn't football games that you live your manhood through, okay?
[01:40:52.686 --> 01:40:54.308]  This is bleeding women.
[01:40:55.890 --> 01:40:58.412]  On the sidewalk, you guys just decided to shoot.
[01:40:58.933 --> 01:41:02.216]  By the way, this case started when one of them accidentally pulled the trigger.
[01:41:02.276 --> 01:41:05.199]  It's now come out and hits this woman in the back of the leg.
[01:41:05.499 --> 01:41:07.281]  She turns around and said, you shot me!
[01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:08.122]  What is that for?
[01:41:09.376 --> 01:41:14.379]  And, uh, they didn't like her talking bucks, so they just... One of us shot, we better all start!
[01:41:15.559 --> 01:41:18.501]  It's like one of these wounded knee massacres or something.
[01:41:19.461 --> 01:41:21.742]  And in the future, folks, it ain't gonna be rubber bullets.
[01:41:22.503 --> 01:41:26.645]  Right now in China, when they're taking people's private property, these little farmers will starve without it.
[01:41:27.145 --> 01:41:28.606]  They'll let you starve in China, by the way.
[01:41:28.626 --> 01:41:29.466]  It's such a good country.
[01:41:29.866 --> 01:41:32.968]  If you don't have, uh, you know, there's no welfare there in the great commie world.
[01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:45.964]  And the farmers, real, real human beings, make Americans look like cowardly pieces of filth, charging Chinese military with machine guns and they have hoes and axes and rakes.
[01:41:47.466 --> 01:41:48.307]  And beating them too!
[01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:57.663]  Because, I mean, you know, the truth is, if you've got 5,000 farmers up against 300 police with machine guns, the farmers come running up and they run the 100 yards.
[01:41:57.683 --> 01:41:59.804]  They run the 50 yards with just bullets.
[01:41:59.844 --> 01:42:00.424]  BOOM!
[01:42:00.484 --> 01:42:00.905]  BOOM!
[01:42:02.165 --> 01:42:03.827]  BOOM!
[01:42:04.227 --> 01:42:09.690]  And the scum in the black uniforms are just savagely crushing their heads in.
[01:42:09.711 --> 01:42:14.834]  And I'm telling the scum that runs this country, your time is coming.
[01:42:16.075 --> 01:42:17.416]  I mean, I see those Chinese.
[01:42:17.476 --> 01:42:19.118]  I just wish we had Americans like that.
[01:42:19.358 --> 01:42:22.020]  Just ramming into them.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.302]  All that anger just pouring into that scum.
[01:42:24.483 --> 01:42:28.026]  Those big fat parasite beetles in those black uniforms.
[01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:34.471]  I need to control myself.
[01:42:35.332 --> 01:42:36.353]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:42:36.413 --> 01:42:38.815]  I just... Have you seen the different videos online?
[01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:39.516]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:47.351]  Where, I mean, the peasants with literal clubs, folks, take on people with machine guns and beat them.
[01:42:48.051 --> 01:42:49.051]  Almost every time.
[01:42:51.913 --> 01:42:57.215]  I mean, nothing on earth can stop a mob of people that are in the right, ladies and gentlemen, fighting for their homes.
[01:43:00.581 --> 01:43:01.621]  No, it's dead here.
[01:43:01.641 --> 01:43:03.302]  I guarantee it'll just mow crowds down.
[01:43:03.322 --> 01:43:03.962]  We'll just beg.
[01:43:04.162 --> 01:43:05.143]  Help me!
[01:43:05.783 --> 01:43:05.923]  Oh!
[01:43:06.123 --> 01:43:07.644]  We're land of the coward!
[01:43:07.884 --> 01:43:09.144]  Home of the slaves!
[01:43:09.364 --> 01:43:09.504]  Oh!
[01:43:10.005 --> 01:43:12.165]  Oh, black uniform God!
[01:43:12.606 --> 01:43:13.746]  Please, oh!
[01:43:14.246 --> 01:43:16.647]  Don't shoot me in the face!
[01:43:16.707 --> 01:43:18.668]  Why did you do it?
[01:43:19.452 --> 01:43:20.312]  I'm probably the same way too.
[01:43:20.353 --> 01:43:22.013]  I'd probably go, because I'm such a slave.
[01:43:22.053 --> 01:43:23.074]  I mean, I come from the slave.
[01:43:23.134 --> 01:43:23.934]  We are the slaves.
[01:43:24.254 --> 01:43:28.516]  I'd probably fall down and go... I mean, I'm not saying I'm anything special.
[01:43:28.556 --> 01:43:29.317]  I'm a scumbag.
[01:43:29.337 --> 01:43:32.178]  Imagine what our founding fathers would think of us.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:37.721]  And a bunch of goons in black going, Yay!
[01:43:37.761 --> 01:43:39.502]  We shot a bunch of innocent people!
[01:43:39.882 --> 01:43:42.603]  Rubber bullets and they had blood pouring out of their faces!
[01:43:43.104 --> 01:43:44.704]  Alright!
[01:43:45.525 --> 01:43:47.966]  I mean, we're a sick, decadent joke!
[01:43:48.613 --> 01:43:49.974]  We really are scum!
[01:43:51.074 --> 01:43:52.815]  Look at what our country's turned into!
[01:43:55.696 --> 01:44:06.660]  And the government blows up buildings right in front of us, and flies planes into them, and the general public's so stupid, not even tuned in to reality at such a low level, they don't automatically know it's an inside job?
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.361]  I mean, come on!
[01:44:08.861 --> 01:44:09.762]  You go look at the evidence?
[01:44:09.782 --> 01:44:14.704]  I mean, just... And I know, just serve the system, police, and just serve it, just fine!
[01:44:15.124 --> 01:44:15.564]  Fine!
[01:44:15.784 --> 01:44:18.105]  The government's not corrupt, your bosses don't deal drugs,
[01:44:19.167 --> 01:44:23.929]  There's not 3.5 trillion or whatever missing from the Pentagon.
[01:44:24.949 --> 01:44:26.289]  No-bid contracts are good.
[01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:27.930]  NAFTA highways are good.
[01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:30.331]  30 million more illegals is good.
[01:44:31.851 --> 01:44:33.972]  Thumbscanning to buy and sell is going to be real good.
[01:44:34.452 --> 01:44:36.593]  Hell, 35 vaccines mandatory now.
[01:44:36.633 --> 01:44:38.054]  They're trying to make them 44.
[01:44:38.654 --> 01:44:39.774]  Mercury's good for you.
[01:44:39.814 --> 01:44:40.534]  You heard the news.
[01:44:40.554 --> 01:44:41.435]  I mean, don't listen to me.
[01:44:42.555 --> 01:44:43.575]  Just don't listen to me.
[01:44:45.676 --> 01:44:47.237]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Texas.
[01:44:47.277 --> 01:44:47.897]  Jim, go ahead.
[01:44:49.693 --> 01:44:50.413]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:51.374 --> 01:44:52.834]  Alex, nice to talk to you again.
[01:44:52.854 --> 01:44:53.895]  Guess what?
[01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:57.536]  There's a real choice in November in the election.
[01:44:57.556 --> 01:45:05.440]  I'm running for governor as a write-in candidate, and the headless quintuplets that are going to be on the ballot, every one of them is unacceptable and we all know it.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:11.102]  My middle name has been legally changed to Patriot to reflect who I am and what I believe in.
[01:45:11.656 --> 01:45:15.298]  I will be on the ballot, so there can be no confusion whatsoever.
[01:45:15.678 --> 01:45:23.282]  So hold on, Jim Dillon, who I know personally, is running for governor, your name is no longer Jim Dillon, it is Patriot?
[01:45:23.883 --> 01:45:26.304]  Yes it is, James Patriot Dillon.
[01:45:26.544 --> 01:45:27.985]  In quotation marks, Alex.
[01:45:28.465 --> 01:45:35.049]  Certified by the court, signed by a judge, on the ballot, listed that way, and there cannot be any confusion whatsoever.
[01:45:35.069 --> 01:45:38.871]  So you're going to be on the gubernatorial ballot in every county?
[01:45:39.892 --> 01:45:40.292]  I will be
[01:45:41.414 --> 01:45:53.643]  And my name, James Patriot Dillon, in quotation marks, Patriot, will be posted prominently in bold type in every polling booth, every polling booth in Texas in November.
[01:45:53.943 --> 01:46:04.230]  And if the millions of Patriots in this state do not make the right selection in this upcoming election, then they're going to deserve everything they're about to get, Alex, and you know it.
[01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:07.152]  Well, Jim, I appreciate your call, but it's more than that.
[01:46:08.728 --> 01:46:11.792]  The national average was 35% like a year ago.
[01:46:11.852 --> 01:46:18.261]  I know it's growing with the CIA run machines and the Feds paying to put them in.
[01:46:18.281 --> 01:46:23.748]  And I know Texas is ahead of the curve on that, so people are trying, they're confused.
[01:46:24.827 --> 01:46:31.749]  So, Jim, if I get down there to vote, I'm not... Travis County is kind of a joke.
[01:46:31.789 --> 01:46:34.370]  Gennady Bois has been caught stealing elections, the county clerk.
[01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:36.051]  It's even been in the newspaper.
[01:46:36.531 --> 01:46:38.952]  And we've got the hard inner civic machines here.
[01:46:39.012 --> 01:46:41.573]  So, as far as I'm concerned, there's not voting in Travis County.
[01:46:42.753 --> 01:46:49.515]  I mean, I just... We should all go out on election day and protest and point out that this is government run.
[01:46:50.295 --> 01:46:51.876]  So, I don't know what to say to you.
[01:46:53.268 --> 01:46:57.650]  But yeah, Jim, I mean, you'd be an interesting governor, I'll tell you that.
[01:46:57.670 --> 01:46:58.711]  I'll definitely vote for you.
[01:46:59.011 --> 01:47:02.633]  People should vote for you if they live in a county where they still have a real election.
[01:47:03.373 --> 01:47:05.054]  See, we've got to admit how bad it is.
[01:47:05.435 --> 01:47:12.958]  I think a lot of it is just admitting that we're in quite a pickle here.
[01:47:14.399 --> 01:47:15.960]  There's a better way of saying it, but I won't.
[01:47:16.821 --> 01:47:19.362]  Jason in Maryland, you're on the air, Jason.
[01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:21.098]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:21.578 --> 01:47:23.619]  Do me a gigantic favor and turn that radio off.
[01:47:25.139 --> 01:47:25.879]  There's no radio.
[01:47:25.899 --> 01:47:27.539]  Okay, well I heard something blaring in the background.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:28.980]  That was a television talk.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:29.420]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:48.964]  I was wondering if you could explain to me... I read what William Cooper had to say about this and I'd like to know if you know what will happen under page six of the Homeland Security with FEMA and everything if there's
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:56.485]  Another real bad attack like you're saying might happen, you know, with all the funeral homes being geared up and everything.
[01:47:56.565 --> 01:48:02.049]  What would happen in the few days following that with our government and our infrastructure?
[01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:03.390]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:04.231]  Let me comment on that.
[01:48:06.067 --> 01:48:19.490]  They'll probably have small bio-releases where only a few hundred people die, maybe even less, but there's lots of hysteria and freaking out, and checkpoints on the highways, and we're locking cities and states down, because they've told us what they'll do.
[01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:20.190]  This is what they've said.
[01:48:20.210 --> 01:48:24.651]  Not that they'll stage the small attack, but they'll tell us what they'll do in an attack.
[01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:28.632]  Lock down the states, lock down the cities, and
[01:48:30.572 --> 01:48:34.956]  Then have lots of hysteria and fear, and use that for a bigger crackdown and lockdown.
[01:48:35.596 --> 01:48:59.575]  Then, a few years later, when you're least expecting it, when they're not hyping the fear, but they've got all the locales trained to go under federal control instantly, that's what this is all about, and the public trained to be totally fearful, and all the preachers recruited, which they're now doing, 13,000 plus counties, and all the mortuaries recruited, it's going to probably be something really deadly.
[01:49:00.393 --> 01:49:02.754]  And there will be dead bodies all over the place.
[01:49:03.715 --> 01:49:05.435]  And they're just going to let it run its course.
[01:49:05.475 --> 01:49:07.857]  They'll be in their bunkers with their cures.
[01:49:08.977 --> 01:49:11.418]  And it's going to be bad.
[01:49:12.799 --> 01:49:17.421]  And they'll kill... Well, they say they're going to kill half of us.
[01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:19.322]  They say the bird flu will kill half of us.
[01:49:19.482 --> 01:49:20.242]  I don't believe that.
[01:49:20.302 --> 01:49:21.783]  I believe it's a hoax.
[01:49:22.183 --> 01:49:25.905]  It's a drill, a warm-up, a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drill.
[01:49:27.206 --> 01:49:27.386]  But...
[01:49:29.947 --> 01:49:32.209]  When they finally get around to the really big ones, it's a 90%.
[01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:35.693]  It's 85 to 95 depending on which document.
[01:49:37.475 --> 01:49:39.257]  But I think a lot of that is going to be in the third world.
[01:49:39.437 --> 01:49:42.960]  They'll probably just kill a few million of us here to get us licking their boots real nice.
[01:49:43.741 --> 01:49:48.426]  And then it's going to be open government worship and the president will be called the great leader.
[01:49:49.587 --> 01:49:50.628]  It's going to be real tough.
[01:49:56.639 --> 01:50:02.060]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:10.142]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.802 --> 01:50:17.843]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.264 --> 01:50:25.125]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.635 --> 01:50:29.738]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.999 --> 01:50:33.481]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.962 --> 01:50:35.903]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.224 --> 01:50:40.127]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:55.137 --> 01:51:06.407]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:10.110]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:14.592]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:14.872 --> 01:51:18.814]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:19.034 --> 01:51:25.578]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:25.798 --> 01:51:31.280]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:31.521 --> 01:51:38.404]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:51:38.624 --> 01:51:41.366]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:43.188 --> 01:51:44.069]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.548 --> 01:51:54.868]  I think so.
[01:52:09.773 --> 01:52:10.433]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.309 --> 01:52:42.392]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.552 --> 01:52:48.577]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:57.684 --> 01:53:00.306]  Coming up in 5 minutes, Jonathan Mosley joins us.
[01:53:00.326 --> 01:53:01.867]  I'm going to try to keep my whole hour.
[01:53:03.949 --> 01:53:07.712]  He wrote this article yesterday on this 5th September anniversary.
[01:53:08.487 --> 01:53:16.470]  On this 5th September 11th anniversary, some hatebush will gather in New York to profane the memory of 3,000 victims.
[01:53:17.410 --> 01:53:20.591]  And it's headlined, 9-1-1 Bush Bashers.
[01:53:22.752 --> 01:53:29.894]  And he goes on to say, many 9-11 conspiracy peddlers spontaneously slander the Jews without rhyme or reason.
[01:53:30.574 --> 01:53:35.296]  And they claim that, he claims that in an email, Jim Fetzer said that to him, which I don't believe.
[01:53:35.356 --> 01:53:37.797]  Fetzer now in a news release he's put out that we
[01:53:38.527 --> 01:53:40.468]  have up on InfoWars.com.
[01:53:40.508 --> 01:53:41.588]  Excuse me, it's not there yet.
[01:53:42.608 --> 01:53:44.069]  My webmaster had an emergency.
[01:53:44.989 --> 01:53:47.630]  It's on JonesReport.com, the only place you can get that.
[01:53:48.110 --> 01:53:52.731]  And we have Professor Jones' response as well to Mr. Mosley.
[01:53:54.772 --> 01:53:57.632]  And, I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff in here.
[01:53:58.252 --> 01:54:06.075]  He claims that Professor Stephen Jones, during the C-SPAN piece, said, there's no peaceful way to achieve the group's goals.
[01:54:06.295 --> 01:54:07.155]  Everybody knows that
[01:54:07.754 --> 01:54:13.880]  He's mild-mannered and said nothing about no way peaceful stuff can, you know, get our goals.
[01:54:15.462 --> 01:54:19.466]  And goes on to claim that he wants a violent overthrow of the government.
[01:54:20.147 --> 01:54:21.588]  That's not true!
[01:54:22.549 --> 01:54:26.013]  So, I mean, this article is amazing.
[01:54:26.634 --> 01:54:30.838]  He uses straw-man arguments to claim that it was a big Jew-bashing fest.
[01:54:31.713 --> 01:54:33.093]  on the C-SPAN, but it wasn't.
[01:54:33.574 --> 01:54:37.735]  He doesn't mention anybody specifically other than Fetzer, he claims, that was doing this.
[01:54:40.875 --> 01:54:44.296]  He claims, our goal is to convince Americans that there's no foreign enemies.
[01:54:44.736 --> 01:54:48.697]  We can now drop our guard, stop defending America, don't be ready to fight.
[01:54:49.257 --> 01:54:55.859]  Such stuff helps Americans' enemies to be more effective in attacking the United States.
[01:54:55.899 --> 01:55:00.400]  So see, we're trying to help Al-Qaeda now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:02.313 --> 01:55:06.235]  This is just a horrible article, and I read into this deeper and deeper and deeper.
[01:55:07.115 --> 01:55:08.476]  So, we're going to have him on.
[01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:18.681]  We're going to have this guy on with us, coming up here at the start of this next segment, and I hope we have time to take your calls.
[01:55:19.942 --> 01:55:25.665]  If he leaves us early, at the bottom of the hour, we'll be able to go to your calls then, but I may even go to calls while he's on with us.
[01:55:26.105 --> 01:55:27.045]  The number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:31.289 --> 01:55:45.372]  And I think I'm going to let one of the people being accused here face his accuser, and I think we're going to have Jim Fetzer on in about 20 minutes to ask a few questions or make a few statements back at Jonathan Mosley.
[01:55:47.733 --> 01:55:57.715]  Mosley also has this statement, quote, after debating these characters extensively, and he goes on to name me first, I believe people need to know who they really are.
[01:55:58.911 --> 01:56:00.373]  And then he goes on to list the characters.
[01:56:00.433 --> 01:56:01.394]  He's never debated me.
[01:56:02.194 --> 01:56:04.797]  And I wanted to debate him yesterday on the phone, but he had to get off.
[01:56:04.897 --> 01:56:05.458]  He's a lawyer.
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.842]  So he'll be joining us here in a few minutes.
[01:56:10.143 --> 01:56:13.126]  Before I end this segment, there's a big 9-11 event coming up.
[01:56:13.546 --> 01:56:15.568]  One night, one night only, next Saturday.
[01:56:15.608 --> 01:56:16.930]  Not this Saturday, next Saturday.
[01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:20.013]  Nine days from now in
[01:56:21.343 --> 01:56:24.764]  Downtown Dallas at the historic and beautiful Lakewood Theatre.
[01:56:24.984 --> 01:56:26.405]  I'll show my new film Terror Storm.
[01:56:26.465 --> 01:56:28.666]  I'll give a speech and take questions and comments for an hour.
[01:56:29.246 --> 01:56:37.529]  I will then introduce Jim Mars, professor, author of the new book, The Terror Conspiracies, that we'll have available there.
[01:56:37.549 --> 01:56:38.989]  He'll give an hour-long speech.
[01:56:39.269 --> 01:56:44.271]  Then we'll show about 35 minutes of video I shot in Canada, never before seen, of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:56:45.772 --> 01:56:47.354]  And then we'll have some live music.
[01:56:47.394 --> 01:56:48.836]  So it's an event you don't want to miss. $10.50.
[01:56:52.987 --> 01:56:55.149]  Coming up this next Saturday.
[01:56:55.169 --> 01:56:56.830]  And that's very cheap for an event this big.
[01:56:57.190 --> 01:56:58.852]  That just helps us break even.
[01:56:59.172 --> 01:57:01.894]  Tickets are still available at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:02.174 --> 01:57:10.361]  By the way, my new film Terror Storm is out and is available, the official DVD, with 66 minutes of extras on the almost two hour film.
[01:57:10.481 --> 01:57:12.463]  So it's almost three hours long total.
[01:57:12.703 --> 01:57:16.506]  That DVD is available now at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:17.742 --> 01:57:21.745]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:22.265 --> 01:57:32.452]  And no matter how hard the neocons fight, get the DVD of Terror Storm, make copies, and know every time you do, you're hurting the people that carried out this attack.
[01:57:33.433 --> 01:57:38.316]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.803 --> 01:57:50.443]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.104 --> 01:57:52.164]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.884 --> 01:57:54.005]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.645 --> 01:57:55.466]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.206 --> 01:57:57.107]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.127 --> 01:58:01.649]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.969 --> 01:58:06.072]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:19.381 --> 01:58:26.326]  All right, welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:26.346 --> 01:58:28.027]  We are now into the third hour.
[01:58:29.048 --> 01:58:35.752]  Yesterday, while I was on air, my producer walked in and handed me an article titled, 9-11 Bush Bashers.
[01:58:36.793 --> 01:58:42.817]  And it said, after debating these characters extensively, I believe people need to know who they really are.
[01:58:42.897 --> 01:58:47.200]  And he's Jonathan Mosley, and I think people should know who he is.
[01:58:48.334 --> 01:58:51.416]  And he has the courage to come on and face us today.
[01:58:51.437 --> 01:58:54.839]  He told me he appreciated my courage having him on.
[01:58:55.299 --> 01:58:58.202]  Hey, a man on the right doesn't have to have courage.
[01:58:58.222 --> 01:59:00.043]  He just is right and that's the way it is.
[01:59:01.164 --> 01:59:05.988]  He says in here that Professor Stephen Jones, and we've reviewed the tape.
[01:59:06.668 --> 01:59:07.389]  We haven't found it.
[01:59:07.429 --> 01:59:09.250]  Maybe he's watching something different we haven't seen.
[01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:13.133]  And now it's been reviewed by others and they're saying it's not there.
[01:59:14.074 --> 01:59:16.616]  That he supposedly called for violent overthrow of the U.S.
[01:59:16.656 --> 01:59:17.036]  government.
[01:59:17.728 --> 01:59:20.590]  There's a lot of other stuff in here that I think needs to be addressed.
[01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:22.671]  Mr. Mosley, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:59:23.051 --> 01:59:24.012]  Hi, how are you doing?
[01:59:24.592 --> 01:59:25.472]  I am doing really good.
[01:59:25.673 --> 01:59:34.738]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and your association with the publishing company that put out the Swift Boats Captain book for us.
[01:59:34.838 --> 01:59:35.778]  Can you tell us about that?
[01:59:36.119 --> 01:59:43.503]  Well, yeah, I wrote the book proposal for Unfit for Command to get that published because it's actually owned by my brother-in-law.
[01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:50.637]  Um, the, uh, one of his authors was Barbara Olson, um, who was killed at the Pentagon on flight 77.
[01:59:50.677 --> 01:59:52.639]  The Solicitor General's wife, yeah.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:53.220]  Right.
[01:59:53.981 --> 02:00:00.728]  And, you know, I, uh, she was at, I went to her funeral with, uh, Ted Olson and his family.
[02:00:01.568 --> 02:00:03.389]  It's a good move, personalizing it.
[02:00:03.650 --> 02:00:06.191]  Personalize it as if it's with your argument.
[02:00:06.631 --> 02:00:09.033]  In fact, that's how you open your article, Crafty.
[02:00:09.413 --> 02:00:14.557]  It says in here that we profane the memory of the 3,000 victims.
[02:00:14.577 --> 02:00:15.417]  Go ahead, you have the floor.
[02:00:15.677 --> 02:00:17.278]  Tell us how we profane their memory.
[02:00:17.839 --> 02:00:27.505]  Because we have a foreign enemy who has attacked us and has been attacking us since 1979 and hit the World Trade Center in 1993 and tells us they want to kill us again and again.
[02:00:27.525 --> 02:00:29.026]  And instead of
[02:00:30.359 --> 02:00:38.363]  Looking at the people who really killed them, they want to use it for a political point to bash George Bush and blame our country.
[02:00:38.383 --> 02:00:40.264]  It's awfully easy to talk about technicalities.
[02:00:40.845 --> 02:00:43.226]  Well, let's start with that, sir.
[02:00:44.846 --> 02:00:49.769]  Jonathan, you say that it's Bush-bashers, and then you talk about how it's liberals.
[02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:55.872]  Did you know that actually, I've looked at it, most people that believe 9-11 is an inside job are actually conservatives?
[02:00:56.681 --> 02:01:12.691]  Well, most people I've talked to, I would have a hard time believing that, because the arguments invariably degenerate into... Well, but see, Bush is no conservative, sir, so see... I mean, out of the gate, you're claiming he's a conservative, when by every yardstick, he's not a conservative.
[02:01:13.072 --> 02:01:18.535]  Well, that could be, and the issue here isn't whether, you know, it's okay to bash Bush or not.
[02:01:18.595 --> 02:01:21.777]  My point is that they're certainly not looking for the truth.
[02:01:22.438 --> 02:01:26.180]  The whole movement here is, we want to know the truth about 9-11, and my argument is, no, you don't.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:31.942]  Because you go from questions to conclusions without anything in between.
[02:01:32.742 --> 02:01:35.343]  And because you keep changing your story.
[02:01:35.983 --> 02:01:44.806]  Mr. Mosley, you can go out and find crazy people that think no planes hit the towers and then try to strawman claim them that we quote keep changing our story.
[02:01:45.166 --> 02:01:47.406]  I haven't changed my story from before 9-11.
[02:01:47.426 --> 02:01:52.008]  And I asked you yesterday, I said, have you heard of Operation Northwoods?
[02:01:52.048 --> 02:01:55.629]  And you said that you had heard me talk about it, but that you didn't know about it.
[02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:59.252]  Shouldn't you go find out if my claim about an official U.S.
[02:01:59.272 --> 02:02:05.578]  government document to carry out 9-11 style attacks, shouldn't you go find out if that exists, or you just decide that doesn't exist?
[02:02:05.879 --> 02:02:12.766]  Well, I don't believe it exists, but I think that most of the argument here is the fallacy of the possible.
[02:02:12.926 --> 02:02:14.948]  You say because it could have happened, therefore it did.
[02:02:16.553 --> 02:02:16.893]  No, sir.
[02:02:16.933 --> 02:02:19.874]  You just said you don't believe Northwoods exists, but you're not going to investigate it.
[02:02:20.174 --> 02:02:24.157]  Well, I could, but how would, you know, do you... I'm going to Congress, sir.
[02:02:24.217 --> 02:02:30.140]  It is ABC News, Baltimore Sun, declassified in April of 2000.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:31.641]  Stay there, sir.
[02:02:32.001 --> 02:02:33.262]  Let's go through it piece by piece.
[02:02:33.282 --> 02:02:34.962]  I'm going to give you a minute, then I'll take a minute.
[02:02:35.303 --> 02:02:36.463]  I've got my atomic clock right here.
[02:02:36.483 --> 02:02:37.184]  I'll try to be fair.
[02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:38.584]  Stay with us.
[02:02:39.045 --> 02:02:39.985]  We appreciate you joining us.
[02:02:48.636 --> 02:02:51.817]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.157 --> 02:02:54.097]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.457 --> 02:03:02.119]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.799 --> 02:03:09.840]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.261 --> 02:03:17.122]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.631 --> 02:03:21.673]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.993 --> 02:03:25.495]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.955 --> 02:03:27.876]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.217 --> 02:03:32.119]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.776 --> 02:04:48.137]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:48.377 --> 02:04:50.398]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:50.558 --> 02:04:57.621]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.

[02:05:46.182 --> 02:05:51.766]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.123 --> 02:05:55.385]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[02:05:55.425 --> 02:05:57.426]  We wage war on corruption.
[02:05:58.547 --> 02:06:00.688]  We crash the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:00.728 --> 02:06:09.214]  About to go back to our guest, Jonathan Mosley, who a lot of folks that snipe at us won't come on and take their medicine, but he's doing it, so I gotta commend him.
[02:06:09.554 --> 02:06:10.655]  He's getting in the arena.
[02:06:11.796 --> 02:06:13.557]  Get ready, I'm gonna open the gates on him in a minute.
[02:06:14.551 --> 02:06:17.813]  The Terror Conspiracy, Deception, 9-1-1, and the Loss of Liberty.
[02:06:18.173 --> 02:06:27.718]  Award-winning journalist and professor Jim Mars has written a new out-of-the-park book, A Grand Slam, and you won't be able to get it until September 11th in major stores nationwide.
[02:06:28.198 --> 02:06:37.103]  We have it early, because I happen to be the publisher of this, just so happens to be the publisher of my new documentary film.
[02:06:37.163 --> 02:06:39.364]  It'll be in stores nationwide.
[02:06:40.665 --> 02:06:42.806]  That's about everything but neocon Walmart, folks.
[02:06:44.144 --> 02:06:49.649]  And so you can get the Terror Conspiracy from us several weeks before it's in major stores.
[02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:55.375]  You can get it right now at InfoWars.com off the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[02:06:55.695 --> 02:06:59.279]  And my new film Terror Storm is out, the best film I've ever made.
[02:06:59.659 --> 02:07:03.443]  Conclusively, right off CIE.gov, Library of Congress,
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:10.786]  Members of Parliament, government experts, their own documents where the government admits they carry out hundreds of terror attacks.
[02:07:11.346 --> 02:07:12.487]  It's so crushing.
[02:07:13.028 --> 02:07:14.549]  It's going to hurt the New World Order bad.
[02:07:14.850 --> 02:07:16.111]  It's going to defend this Republic.
[02:07:16.491 --> 02:07:17.772]  You want to stop the American Union?
[02:07:17.812 --> 02:07:19.174]  You want to stop their whole agenda?
[02:07:19.694 --> 02:07:28.097]  You do that by blowing the fake conservatives politically out of the water, showing how they control the liberals, how Hillary's on the payroll, Clinton's on the payroll.
[02:07:28.437 --> 02:07:31.238]  You expose how they're terrorists and we can defeat them together.
[02:07:31.598 --> 02:07:37.140]  We can actually get the country back instead of being pacified by these government operatives out there that pose as conservatives.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.021]  And then you've got the well-meaning folks out there.
[02:07:39.927 --> 02:07:42.368]  Like Jonathan Mosley, who joins us now.
[02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:44.489]  Mr. Mosley, you've got the floor.
[02:07:44.529 --> 02:07:46.890]  You've written this big article, 9-1-1 Bush Bashers.
[02:07:47.190 --> 02:07:48.390]  Tell us how we're all wrong.
[02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:55.093]  Tell us why we're smirching, profaning, to use your language, the memory of the 3,000 dead on 9-11.
[02:07:55.113 --> 02:08:03.016]  Well, one of the biggest things that upsets me about this is that the effect of this is to not guard us against a real enemy.
[02:08:03.136 --> 02:08:06.897]  Now, if there are other enemies and other people we need to bring to justice, that's fine.
[02:08:06.957 --> 02:08:09.018]  But we know we have an enemy out there that wants to kill us.
[02:08:09.682 --> 02:08:11.683]  And the effect of this is saying, drop your guard.
[02:08:11.703 --> 02:08:16.404]  It's like a boxer letting his guard down so he can get walloped again.
[02:08:16.924 --> 02:08:22.866]  Now, I know that from your perspective, you don't want to be blamed for what other conspiracy theorists are saying about this.
[02:08:23.006 --> 02:08:28.107]  And one of the points I make is that there's a mishmash of different theories out there.
[02:08:28.747 --> 02:08:31.748]  And as a consequence of that, people say, oh, there's overwhelming evidence.
[02:08:31.828 --> 02:08:34.629]  But the overwhelming evidence is all contradicting each other.
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:41.943]  From your perspective, you want to be held accountable for your beliefs, but from the perspective of the country and people listening, they're hearing it all.
[02:08:42.623 --> 02:08:53.907]  I don't know how to respond to that, but we keep hearing all this craziness go back and forth, and it does keep changing when they encounter facts, they just switch to another argument.
[02:08:54.407 --> 02:08:59.549]  There is only one official story, but there's hundreds of alternatives, which of course can't all be wrong.
[02:09:00.070 --> 02:09:02.050]  But the thing is that
[02:09:04.335 --> 02:09:06.257]  There are several formats here of what happened.
[02:09:07.177 --> 02:09:13.042]  What got me into this, you know, considering what their memory of Barbara Olsen, who I knew, is to hear these facts being asserted.
[02:09:13.062 --> 02:09:17.106]  Then you go back and you check on them, and the initial fact turns out to be false.
[02:09:17.586 --> 02:09:21.769]  Now, I don't know, that might not be true of your arguments, but it's true of an awful lot of the stuff out there.
[02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:32.198]  Beginning with the idea that, you know, there's a 16-foot hole in the Pentagon, when the engineers measured it at 90 feet, and there's hundreds of eyewitnesses.
[02:09:32.597 --> 02:09:33.137]  And this kind of thing.
[02:09:33.177 --> 02:09:38.059]  So there's this structure of an assertion of fact, and then a whole bunch of arguments flowing from it.
[02:09:38.199 --> 02:09:39.340]  Go back and check the fact.
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:41.580]  It turns out not to hold up.
[02:09:42.261 --> 02:09:46.142]  The other thing is that what bothers me most is that people say, well, this is not plausible.
[02:09:46.742 --> 02:09:49.303]  They then suggest something that's infinitely less plausible.
[02:09:50.324 --> 02:10:00.227]  That there are thousands of people with no motivation to keep quiet who've all kept silent, including civilian radar operators and airline personnel.
[02:10:00.267 --> 02:10:01.848]  The airlines lost billions of dollars.
[02:10:03.583 --> 02:10:05.744]  It's just completely implausible.
[02:10:05.784 --> 02:10:12.746]  If you're going to argue from the idea that something is not plausible, I think the alternative needs to stand up to your own yardstick.
[02:10:12.766 --> 02:10:13.586]  Okay, stop right there.
[02:10:13.706 --> 02:10:19.668]  You just had three minutes, and I want to run over what you just said briefly, and then I'll let you continue to spout that stuff.
[02:10:21.148 --> 02:10:24.009]  Number one, you say people wouldn't keep quiet.
[02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:26.370]  FBI agent Robert Wright got up on
[02:10:27.148 --> 02:10:33.390]  C-SPAN at the National Press Club and held up a letter where he'll be threatened under national security for treason.
[02:10:33.911 --> 02:10:42.494]  If he tells the public what he knows, he begins crying and breaks down and says, all I can tell you is, the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:10:42.874 --> 02:10:43.434]  That's a quote.
[02:10:43.494 --> 02:10:46.975]  And then we get the memorandum from the President, W199I, ordering
[02:10:48.982 --> 02:11:06.152]  The FBI and CIA and Defense Intelligence, Able Danger, which we now have even more on, to back off the Bin Laden operations in Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as AQ Khan Laboratories in Pakistan developing hydrogen weapons and delivery systems, and it's now all on record.
[02:11:06.192 --> 02:11:08.934]  And I'm sure with that you'll say it doesn't exist.
[02:11:09.254 --> 02:11:13.296]  I'm sorry, everything I just said does exist in triplicate mainstream news.
[02:11:13.917 --> 02:11:14.237]  Also,
[02:11:15.106 --> 02:11:19.912]  There were countless other FBI and other government people who were threatened with arrest if they wouldn't shut up.
[02:11:20.153 --> 02:11:26.621]  When a colonel blew the whistle, they tried to charge him for $67 of unauthorized cell phone calls to his wife.
[02:11:27.222 --> 02:11:28.704]  This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[02:11:28.724 --> 02:11:30.847]  They threatened Sybil Edmonds with arrest.
[02:11:31.667 --> 02:11:33.248]  All of this, so just don't try it.
[02:11:33.608 --> 02:11:36.370]  Also, don't try to say they couldn't keep something this big secret.
[02:11:36.610 --> 02:11:49.977]  They used drills to smokescreen it, compartmentalize inside these different government agencies and they kept the Manhattan Project secret with over 100,000 employees for four years and other facets of it secret.
[02:11:50.237 --> 02:11:51.158]  We're good to go.
[02:12:05.712 --> 02:12:10.934]  Then you talk about how we have all these different stories, but the government has one unified story.
[02:12:11.094 --> 02:12:13.614]  They've given five different reasons for Building 7 falling.
[02:12:13.814 --> 02:12:15.035]  Now they say they don't know why.
[02:12:15.355 --> 02:12:20.536]  They said there were no steel columns in the middle of Tower 1 and 2, and they have the biggest columns you can put in a building that size.
[02:12:20.556 --> 02:12:24.077]  47 four-foot-a-round giant steel reinforced columns.
[02:12:24.257 --> 02:12:28.079]  You've got the entire commission being called independent, being appointed by George Bush.
[02:12:28.279 --> 02:12:32.440]  You've got a bunch of the commission on the Carlisle Group payroll, Zelikow and the rest of them.
[02:12:33.803 --> 02:12:41.066]  I'm going to stop right there and I'm just going to add that a lot of these people putting out the no planes at the Pentagon thing, I predicted stuff like this would happen.
[02:12:41.226 --> 02:12:50.550]  This is a classic setup where they put out ridiculous disinfo on purpose, buildings draw men, a lot of these are operatives, so then you guys can come discredit false stories.
[02:12:50.610 --> 02:12:52.111]  Go ahead, you've got three more minutes.
[02:12:52.571 --> 02:13:00.014]  Okay, well of course we kept the Manhattan Project secret because the people working on it knew it was in favor of their country and were patriots.
[02:13:00.594 --> 02:13:02.835]  No one watching the mass murder on television
[02:13:03.447 --> 02:13:05.024]  And see and all the, remember...
[02:13:05.342 --> 02:13:09.524]  The World Trade Center site was owned by the firefighters for weeks.
[02:13:09.564 --> 02:13:10.644]  They were looking for their buddies.
[02:13:10.864 --> 02:13:13.946]  Now on record they've reported they found the black boxes and ordered to shut up about it.
[02:13:13.966 --> 02:13:14.446]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:13:14.506 --> 02:13:16.107]  I want that they found the passports.
[02:13:16.167 --> 02:13:18.808]  Two of them magically didn't get... Oh, you're... Oh, yes.
[02:13:19.408 --> 02:13:23.170]  The firefighters, many of them, think there were bombs in the buildings and think it's an inside job.
[02:13:23.190 --> 02:13:29.373]  The head of the biggest victims family group says that he believes it's an inside job now and the majority of his members do.
[02:13:29.793 --> 02:13:30.293]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:13:30.433 --> 02:13:31.093]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:31.293 --> 02:13:31.614]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:31.634 --> 02:13:32.294]  I cut in on you.
[02:13:32.354 --> 02:13:33.114]  I apologize.
[02:13:33.414 --> 02:13:34.635]  But they didn't... Okay, look.
[02:13:35.175 --> 02:13:44.923]  To demolish the building the way I understand it is argued, you'd have to have 43,000 demolition devices, 236 steel columns around the outside.
[02:13:44.943 --> 02:13:47.905]  You know, some number inside, some people say 47.
[02:13:48.105 --> 02:13:52.629]  Then you times 80 or 90 floors, because you wouldn't know which floor.
[02:13:52.649 --> 02:13:53.269]  Well, that's not true.
[02:13:53.289 --> 02:14:02.817]  It would take a few hundred devices in Tower 1, which is larger explosives, and it would take several hundred devices in Building 7 with the classic bottom-down crimp blow.
[02:14:03.385 --> 02:14:07.288]  Well, of course, the news footage shows it falling from the top down.
[02:14:07.348 --> 02:14:09.810]  No controlled demolition in history has ever been from the top down.
[02:14:09.850 --> 02:14:10.610]  That's what I just said.
[02:14:10.650 --> 02:14:12.992]  Tower 1 and 2 were blown from the top down.
[02:14:13.032 --> 02:14:14.653]  You can see the squibs as they explode.
[02:14:14.913 --> 02:14:16.855]  I'm saying 7 was the classic demolition.
[02:14:17.515 --> 02:14:19.757]  But the technical arguments, this is where they're all inconsistent.
[02:14:19.777 --> 02:14:21.458]  The technical arguments are that the falling
[02:14:22.183 --> 02:14:25.365]  Well, let's do this.
[02:14:25.406 --> 02:14:29.168]  Let's say that magically passports flew out undamaged, but everything else was destroyed.
[02:14:30.089 --> 02:14:31.170]  No discernible remains.
[02:14:31.570 --> 02:14:34.292]  Let's just say that the planes made those fall.
[02:14:34.752 --> 02:14:37.834]  Building 7, what are you going to fall back on?
[02:14:37.874 --> 02:14:41.717]  Which one of the five stories that the government gives us are you going to give us on 7?
[02:14:43.530 --> 02:14:44.030]  Something like that?
[02:14:44.070 --> 02:14:45.470]  I don't think there's an official story.
[02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:48.571]  There's an... Well, you said there's one official story, sir!
[02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:49.591]  No, there's five!
[02:14:49.771 --> 02:14:51.552]  There's five, and they've abandoned all five!
[02:14:51.832 --> 02:14:54.712]  No, well... Have you actually read the NIST report like I have?
[02:14:54.932 --> 02:14:57.433]  Have you actually read the entire 9-11 Commission report?
[02:14:57.713 --> 02:15:00.673]  I've read the NIST report on World Trade Center 7.
[02:15:01.013 --> 02:15:04.854]  Look, if you go back, and I have the news footage that I recorded from the day of and that week.
[02:15:05.294 --> 02:15:09.755]  If you look at the... One tower collapsed neatly, the other tower collapsed very messy.
[02:15:10.182 --> 02:15:14.805]  There are chunks coming out of that top as big as ten, you know, ten houses together.
[02:15:15.285 --> 02:15:16.546]  Well, they blew it in sections.
[02:15:16.566 --> 02:15:23.690]  They blew it in... The metal was cut off perfectly in two-story and one-story sections.
[02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:25.331]  Perfectly sliced.
[02:15:25.551 --> 02:15:27.452]  Then they said, no cameras, no photos.
[02:15:27.793 --> 02:15:32.636]  Well, how would they do that without 43,000 separate demolition devices?
[02:15:33.416 --> 02:15:37.178]  Major companies could have wired each one of those towers in two weeks apiece.
[02:15:37.378 --> 02:15:42.780]  They had major drills, they had evacuations, they had major floors closed down, they had all sorts of weird people.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:54.185]  I've talked to the janitorial staff that were in there, just like Oklahoma City that Clinton pulled off when they caught the different guys in there with the grey sticks of butter drilling the columns.
[02:15:54.225 --> 02:15:55.446]  They told them they were maintenance people.
[02:15:56.149 --> 02:16:01.552]  Well, and you would have to drill the columns because you would have to put the explosive directly against it.
[02:16:01.572 --> 02:16:02.353]  Not if they're big enough.
[02:16:02.413 --> 02:16:04.955]  But yeah, they did drill in Oklahoma City.
[02:16:05.195 --> 02:16:07.036]  Jane Graham, the head of HUD, witnessed them doing it.
[02:16:07.705 --> 02:16:09.346]  Okay, but then you'd need miles of wire.
[02:16:09.386 --> 02:16:10.787]  No, Bill Clinton didn't do it, he's nice.
[02:16:11.107 --> 02:16:18.852]  And you'd need miles of wire, and demolition experts have looked at that, that you always have to... No, you don't need miles of wire, you can go out the synchronized radio beacon.
[02:16:19.132 --> 02:16:27.317]  Okay, but you couldn't synchronize different floors that way with... Have you ever tried to take a radio inside of a... No, you have different layers on different radio frequencies.
[02:16:27.337 --> 02:16:30.759]  Have you ever tried to take a radio inside of a big steel building?
[02:16:30.779 --> 02:16:34.721]  Sure, the government has all sorts of systems, and they use radio a lot on these buildings.
[02:16:34.961 --> 02:16:38.464]  Okay, but steel doesn't... You're not answering Building 7, sir.
[02:16:38.504 --> 02:16:39.705]  The middle collapses.
[02:16:39.825 --> 02:16:42.908]  It perfectly falls in on itself in a perfect little pile.
[02:16:43.268 --> 02:16:44.489]  But that isn't what happened.
[02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:50.094]  What happened was a demolition involved blowing out the bottom floor.
[02:16:50.114 --> 02:16:53.337]  There's no demolition in history, and why would anybody try it?
[02:16:53.417 --> 02:16:54.558]  It would be unprecedented.
[02:16:54.578 --> 02:16:54.959]  Wait a minute.
[02:16:54.999 --> 02:17:00.984]  Building 7 was the classic where you blow out the central column, then you blow out the outside columns, and it falls in on itself perfectly.
[02:17:01.773 --> 02:17:04.394]  It fell at the speed of an apple.
[02:17:04.654 --> 02:17:07.755]  But it fell from the top down, not from the bottom up.
[02:17:08.015 --> 02:17:08.355]  No, no.
[02:17:08.395 --> 02:17:10.936]  Building 7 fell from the bottom, sir.
[02:17:10.996 --> 02:17:12.036]  No, you look at it.
[02:17:12.056 --> 02:17:13.957]  The penthouse, the first thing... Well, no.
[02:17:14.337 --> 02:17:17.758]  The NIST report says it fell from the bottom down.
[02:17:17.918 --> 02:17:20.159]  No, the first change is the penthouse.
[02:17:20.219 --> 02:17:20.719]  No, no, no, sir.
[02:17:20.759 --> 02:17:22.960]  That's how you do it with a bottom down.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.341]  You blow the central column so that goes first on every Las Vegas demolition.
[02:17:28.581 --> 02:17:29.482]  It's a classic one.
[02:17:29.802 --> 02:17:30.062]  Okay?
[02:17:30.082 --> 02:17:30.702]  You're confused.
[02:17:31.298 --> 02:17:38.061]  They blow the central column, it falls, then the outside columns are blown, and so it falls in on itself.
[02:17:38.901 --> 02:17:39.182]  Come on!
[02:17:40.182 --> 02:17:41.523]  Fine, we'll hear more from you.
[02:17:41.603 --> 02:17:44.204]  You're going to be with us until 45 after, maybe longer.

[02:17:49.506 --> 02:17:55.129]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:17:55.169 --> 02:17:55.889]  Supreme Court.
[02:17:56.696 --> 02:18:00.980]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an I-Nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:04.643]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:18:05.624 --> 02:18:10.908]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[02:18:47.753 --> 02:18:50.095]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.586 --> 02:18:57.389]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.609 --> 02:19:00.351]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.391 --> 02:19:01.511]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.852 --> 02:19:07.455]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.375 --> 02:19:15.640]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:19.682]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:21.832 --> 02:19:25.295]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:26.276 --> 02:19:27.557]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:27.797 --> 02:19:29.999]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:36.925]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:37.606 --> 02:19:38.026]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:38.066 --> 02:19:38.267]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.712 --> 02:19:50.937]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:19:51.077 --> 02:19:59.164]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:06.470]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:13.911]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:20:14.091 --> 02:20:19.172]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:20:19.292 --> 02:20:28.154]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:20:28.434 --> 02:20:31.735]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:20:33.835 --> 02:20:34.176]  We're good.
[02:20:46.089 --> 02:20:46.329]  I think so.

[02:21:58.962 --> 02:22:01.543]  Attorney at law, living in Virginia.
[02:22:02.323 --> 02:22:05.604]  Professor Jim Fetzer, the founder and the head of 9-11 Scholars for Truth, has called in.
[02:22:05.904 --> 02:22:07.525]  We've also got Barry Homish listening.
[02:22:08.514 --> 02:22:14.938]  And I'll try to get him on in the next segment, and maybe I'll just try to keep our guests the entire hour, because people are just going wild to hear this.
[02:22:14.998 --> 02:22:17.320]  I would just add on the imploding and falling buildings.
[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:19.461]  No modern steel building had ever collapsed from fire.
[02:22:19.501 --> 02:22:24.224]  He claims one that did, but that was a separate, smaller, older construction.
[02:22:24.985 --> 02:22:30.228]  And, I mean, you know, top scientists, the University of Edinburgh is on record, and BBC's saying one's never fallen.
[02:22:30.248 --> 02:22:35.171]  They just tried to burn a building down over a month period with different experiments, and they couldn't do it.
[02:22:35.211 --> 02:22:36.572]  That was on BBC last week.
[02:22:37.325 --> 02:22:40.506]  And we had the Magritte fire with 100 foot white hot flames.
[02:22:40.586 --> 02:22:43.327]  The big columns didn't collapse.
[02:22:43.767 --> 02:22:46.228]  How do you respond to that, Mr. Mosley?
[02:22:47.728 --> 02:22:49.689]  They're not uniform, identical things.
[02:22:49.829 --> 02:22:55.671]  The idea is if one falls from ordinary fire, that proves that the temperature from ordinary fire can compromise steel.
[02:22:55.771 --> 02:22:57.331]  So we just got three of those in one day.
[02:22:58.051 --> 02:22:59.912]  Not anywhere else, but three in one day, one spot.
[02:22:59.952 --> 02:23:06.274]  When you talk about three in one day, that's language of randomness, which indicates that there must be a causal element.
[02:23:06.314 --> 02:23:06.634]  There is.
[02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:09.506]  There's a terrorist attack that hit, that affected all three.
[02:23:09.586 --> 02:23:10.687]  So that's not surprising.
[02:23:11.127 --> 02:23:18.011]  But the thing is, is the McCormick, look, people say no building ever fell, fell from fire alone.
[02:23:18.131 --> 02:23:20.292]  I got on the internet five minutes later, I came up with a dozen.
[02:23:20.748 --> 02:23:22.269]  that have partially or totally collapsed.
[02:23:22.589 --> 02:23:23.449]  That is not true.
[02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:26.230]  Floors have collapsed, not the main central.
[02:23:26.290 --> 02:23:29.951]  You can go to some old building, some 1900.
[02:23:29.991 --> 02:23:31.732]  We're talking about modern steel buildings.
[02:23:31.752 --> 02:23:32.212]  You know what?
[02:23:32.472 --> 02:23:33.692]  I'll let you get more into that, sir.
[02:23:33.872 --> 02:23:42.315]  But right now, I want to give Professor Fetzer, who you really hit the hardest in here, a chance to ask you some questions.
[02:23:42.575 --> 02:23:44.416]  Professor Fetzer, go ahead and make your statements.
[02:23:45.194 --> 02:23:49.897]  Yes, many of the claims this guy made during this internet exchange were actually corrected online.
[02:23:49.917 --> 02:23:56.381]  He nevertheless went ahead and put them, even knowing better, knowing that they were false or blunders, he nevertheless included them in his article.
[02:23:56.441 --> 02:24:00.663]  Now, this guy, for example, McCormick Place was a convention center.
[02:24:00.683 --> 02:24:05.046]  It wasn't a steel structure high-rise with welded and redundant features like the Twin Towers.
[02:24:05.466 --> 02:24:07.848]  So he simply pretends he doesn't know the difference.
[02:24:07.988 --> 02:24:09.849]  If he doesn't know the difference, he's incompetent.
[02:24:09.889 --> 02:24:11.430]  If he does know the difference, he's corrupt.
[02:24:12.017 --> 02:24:16.120]  He's been fanatical, even obsessive, about posting attacks on members of Scholars.
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:20.503]  I did a search, for example, Alex, on recent Mosley posts.
[02:24:21.043 --> 02:24:22.624]  On the 23rd of July, he put up 19.
[02:24:23.285 --> 02:24:24.486]  On the 1st of August, 22.
[02:24:24.866 --> 02:24:27.287]  On the 15th of August, he posted 15 attacks.
[02:24:27.748 --> 02:24:32.491]  His typical style was to post, then as soon as there was a response, he'd post again immediately.
[02:24:32.511 --> 02:24:35.193]  His whole style was immature and juvenile.
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:41.648]  If he was advancing serious arguments about our findings, they might have been justified in spite of that, but they committed elementary fallacies.
[02:24:41.668 --> 02:24:42.649]  Well, stop there, Professor.
[02:24:42.669 --> 02:24:43.871]  I want to give him a chance to respond.
[02:24:43.891 --> 02:24:46.875]  We'll hold you over, and both of you are gracious to come on.
[02:24:47.556 --> 02:24:52.883]  My concern here is that he says that Professor Jones
[02:24:53.707 --> 02:24:55.187]  Advocated the overthrow of the U.S.
[02:24:55.227 --> 02:24:55.587]  government.
[02:24:55.627 --> 02:24:56.668]  We've watched the tape.
[02:24:57.228 --> 02:24:58.448]  No one can find that.
[02:24:59.388 --> 02:25:01.989]  Mr. Mosley, I'm confused here.
[02:25:02.029 --> 02:25:02.929]  You're a smart guy.
[02:25:02.969 --> 02:25:03.569]  You're a lawyer.
[02:25:04.089 --> 02:25:07.910]  Where on that C-SPAN footage did Jones advocate the overthrow of the U.S.
[02:25:07.930 --> 02:25:08.230]  government?
[02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:11.011]  About 80% through the tape, there's a question.
[02:25:11.551 --> 02:25:17.412]  Can our aims be satisfied without violent overthrow of the government?
[02:25:18.152 --> 02:25:23.193]  Professor Jones responds echoing the Declaration of Independence and ends up saying no.
[02:25:24.197 --> 02:25:24.838]  It cannot be.
[02:25:25.378 --> 02:25:35.905]  Alex, I hate to say there's been a gross misrepresentation by Mr. Mosley, but I've been in contact with Steve Jones.
[02:25:35.945 --> 02:25:41.449]  We have Professor Jones comments that he emailed us now up on JonesReport.com.
[02:25:41.589 --> 02:25:42.470]  This is ridiculous.
[02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:45.952]  It's outrageous and even libelous that he makes these kinds of things up.
[02:25:46.052 --> 02:25:48.594]  Okay, well what did he exactly say then?
[02:25:48.774 --> 02:25:53.117]  He said there is no peaceful means to achieve our goals.
[02:25:53.772 --> 02:25:54.252]  That's wrong.
[02:25:54.292 --> 02:25:56.514]  That's false, untrue, and completely not what he said.
[02:25:56.534 --> 02:25:57.275]  He denied it.
[02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:57.775]  I was there.
[02:25:57.815 --> 02:26:00.177]  He said we have to use constitutional means.
[02:26:00.517 --> 02:26:02.238]  He specifically enforced impeachment.
[02:26:02.278 --> 02:26:04.219]  You obviously took something out of context.
[02:26:04.279 --> 02:26:07.141]  Just like the no planes hit the hit, we didn't see what we saw.
[02:26:07.181 --> 02:26:09.163]  It was on national television for everybody to see.
[02:26:09.713 --> 02:26:12.034]  We didn't see it because it was some kind of murder.
[02:26:12.074 --> 02:26:13.075]  Who's making that claim?
[02:26:13.095 --> 02:26:18.357]  You're now just picking from different sources to try to make together some kind of inconsistent theory.
[02:26:18.397 --> 02:26:20.838]  He's now implying that we're saying that and we're denying that.
[02:26:21.318 --> 02:26:26.501]  We're telling you, sir, that we've gone and watched the tape and your interpretation of what he said is out of left field.
[02:26:26.801 --> 02:26:28.301]  Everybody can watch it for themselves.
[02:26:28.742 --> 02:26:31.703]  They certainly can and discover that you're committing a libelous act.
[02:26:32.378 --> 02:26:34.259]  Well, I'm a lawyer, and I would know better.
[02:26:34.279 --> 02:26:38.943]  Well, you ought to know better, but you commit such elementary fallacies, I don't think you're good enough to testify.
[02:26:38.983 --> 02:26:39.944]  Well, where does this come from?
[02:26:39.984 --> 02:26:42.646]  Where does this come from, saying that Fetzer is attacking Jews?
[02:26:42.946 --> 02:26:45.107]  Because I've never heard... Fetzer's pretty liberal.
[02:26:45.147 --> 02:26:46.989]  I haven't ever heard him criticize Jews.
[02:26:47.169 --> 02:26:47.749]  I didn't say that.
[02:26:47.949 --> 02:26:51.672]  I said some of the others are, but I cannot... About 90% of the discussion...
[02:26:53.366 --> 02:27:20.568]  uh... that we've had on the internet and discussion group i cannot wait a minute let me let me read back in here a professor professor in the report i've got the three-page article for it yeah i mean is there a part here where he does say that he's got a cute he quote he's got a cute little bit of you because he was back in our program yeah that that's correct that you have a lot of that he and it was a little bit about that is that i want to go to the bottom of this because uh... i mean obviously the
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:25.224]  The indication there is, ooh, he wanted to know if I was a Jew.
[02:27:26.366 --> 02:27:27.767]  I'm just totally confused by that.
[02:27:28.348 --> 02:27:33.754]  Professor Vetser and I have been criticized for not saying it's Israel that carried out the attacks.
[02:27:35.956 --> 02:27:36.857]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.338 --> 02:27:38.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:42.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.655 --> 02:27:48.377]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:27:48.758 --> 02:27:55.243]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[02:27:55.283 --> 02:27:57.225]  That's over 46% savings!
[02:27:57.605 --> 02:27:59.887]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[02:28:01.768 --> 02:28:10.176]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[02:28:10.497 --> 02:28:13.780]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.
[02:28:13.980 --> 02:28:16.442]  There are no age restrictions, all prescriptions are covered, and 95%
[02:28:17.363 --> 02:28:17.663]  I think so.
[02:28:46.161 --> 02:28:47.162]  Good morning, honey.
[02:28:47.502 --> 02:28:53.586]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:28:53.886 --> 02:28:54.507]  Yeah.
[02:28:54.887 --> 02:28:56.308]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:28:56.668 --> 02:29:00.131]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[02:29:00.591 --> 02:29:02.092]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:29:02.572 --> 02:29:04.293]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:29:04.694 --> 02:29:06.475]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:29:06.695 --> 02:29:07.616]  Honey, cheer up.
[02:29:07.996 --> 02:29:10.257]  I brought our sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:29:10.538 --> 02:29:10.818]  What?
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:21.884]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:29:22.184 --> 02:29:27.066]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:29:27.566 --> 02:29:28.727]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[02:29:28.747 --> 02:29:32.549]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209 or get a Sport Berkey for only $39 by calling 888-803-4438 at 888-803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:29:32.569 --> 02:29:33.870]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.194 --> 02:29:47.675]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:29:47.796 --> 02:29:50.157]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:29:50.217 --> 02:29:57.281]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[02:29:57.881 --> 02:30:00.203]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:00.843 --> 02:30:04.385]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:04.925 --> 02:30:09.068]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:09.648 --> 02:30:12.590]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:13.573 --> 02:30:16.494]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:30:17.234 --> 02:30:22.476]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:23.036 --> 02:30:26.317]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:26.557 --> 02:30:29.979]  For the following two free reports.
[02:30:30.859 --> 02:30:31.139]  U.S.
[02:30:31.239 --> 02:30:34.140]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.401]  Call 888-XANADU.
[02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:41.642]  That's 888-XANADU.
[02:30:41.983 --> 02:30:42.943]  And ask for George.
[02:30:45.655 --> 02:30:55.204]  Alright, we're going to go right back to Jonathan Mosley who wrote the big World Net Daily article getting so much attention.
[02:30:55.224 --> 02:30:57.026]  9-11 Bush-bashers.
[02:30:57.046 --> 02:30:57.927]  We've got to be fair with them.
[02:30:57.947 --> 02:31:00.409]  We've got to give them some time to respond here.
[02:31:02.051 --> 02:31:05.494]  But Fetzer, you go ahead and finish up so we can do this one at a time.
[02:31:05.574 --> 02:31:07.036]  Finish your points that you wanted to make.
[02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:10.371]  He's playing several games, Alex.
[02:31:10.531 --> 02:31:12.492]  One is that I asked him who he was.
[02:31:12.572 --> 02:31:17.735]  I sent him an email and asked him about his background because he was acting in such an obsessive, compulsive fashion.
[02:31:18.215 --> 02:31:20.237]  And I truly believe this had to be a child.
[02:31:20.317 --> 02:31:25.579]  In fact, I would insist that this man, he may be older, but he acts like a child.
[02:31:25.619 --> 02:31:36.165]  And I suggest that this person, if I had to guess, was about 15 years old, very bright, probably Jewish, possibly a resident of Brooklyn, attending a scientific technological high school.
[02:31:36.584 --> 02:31:44.610]  Who believes he's superior to everyone else and has an obsession to try to prove it, but I was commenting on his behavior, not the subject of his judge.
[02:31:45.390 --> 02:31:49.733]  Second of all, here's a couple of examples of the shoddy quality of his argument.
[02:31:49.793 --> 02:31:58.180]  He says the Twin Towers can't have come down as a result of controlled demolition because they blow out the first and second floors so the building falls down into its own footprint.
[02:31:58.520 --> 02:32:02.943]  But I pointed out to him online, before he published this article, that was an equivocation
[02:32:03.379 --> 02:32:06.980]  He's just talking about the standard kind of controlled demolition, as in the case of Building 7.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.401]  I pointed out then and emphasized, we're talking about a special kind of controlled demolition.
[02:32:11.741 --> 02:32:14.602]  It's still a controlled demolition, just because it's from the top down.
[02:32:14.682 --> 02:32:16.242]  It's not the standard kind, that's all.
[02:32:16.563 --> 02:32:19.103]  But Building 7 was from the bottom down.
[02:32:19.123 --> 02:32:22.644]  Yeah, Building 7 was a standard controlled demolition, just like we see in Las Vegas.
[02:32:22.704 --> 02:32:24.545]  A few minutes ago he was saying that wasn't the case.
[02:32:24.605 --> 02:32:26.845]  Is that what you're saying, Jonathan?
[02:32:26.865 --> 02:32:29.026]  In a video show, it's definitely not the case.
[02:32:30.113 --> 02:32:32.494]  What is definitely not the case?
[02:32:32.954 --> 02:32:34.234]  It fell from the top down.
[02:32:34.834 --> 02:32:40.996]  You're seeing a blast on the bottom, caused the center pillar to fall, so you see a penthouse fall.
[02:32:41.036 --> 02:32:42.737]  That's a classic scene.
[02:32:42.777 --> 02:32:46.278]  This is clear evidence the guy is completely incompetent to discuss these issues.
[02:32:46.418 --> 02:32:51.999]  All these classic demolitions we see in Las Vegas over and over again.
[02:32:52.379 --> 02:32:56.261]  You have the slight indentation at the top coincidental with the blowing up of the bottom.
[02:32:56.281 --> 02:32:57.821]  They blow up some beams in the center.
[02:32:58.243 --> 02:33:00.725]  To ensure it will implode, fall toward the center.
[02:33:00.865 --> 02:33:04.207]  Enough, Professor Fetzer, but let him, let him count, or let him have some time.
[02:33:04.247 --> 02:33:04.807]  Go ahead.
[02:33:04.967 --> 02:33:08.990]  But there was no blowing out of the bottom floors, as a classic.
[02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:14.934]  And part of the thesis is, see, Professor Fetzer is a philosophy professor who cannot stay on the topic.
[02:33:15.379 --> 02:33:21.586]  The thesis being tested is, number one, everyone says, these fell exactly like a controlled demolition.
[02:33:21.606 --> 02:33:22.427]  Now I'm suspicious.
[02:33:22.507 --> 02:33:25.730]  You go back and say, no, it didn't fall exactly like a controlled demolition.
[02:33:26.131 --> 02:33:29.254]  Now he's saying it's a special controlled demolition that nobody's ever seen before.
[02:33:29.821 --> 02:33:35.103]  Okay, but the original thesis was, we're suspicious because it looks like a controlled demolition when it doesn't.
[02:33:35.383 --> 02:33:38.464]  Well, but that's stupid because... Mr. Mobley, let me say something.
[02:33:38.924 --> 02:33:49.387]  Sir, we say that because the firefighters reported bombs and explosions, and they reported squibs, and on all the videos, 7, 1, and 2, you see the blast points, sir.
[02:33:49.747 --> 02:33:50.347]  No, you don't.
[02:33:50.407 --> 02:33:57.029]  You see the ordinary piston effect of air being, or of an entire floor being compressed down to nothing.
[02:33:57.049 --> 02:33:58.970]  But they're not saying 7 was a pancake.
[02:33:59.688 --> 02:34:01.008]  And pancaking wouldn't do that.
[02:34:01.048 --> 02:34:07.330]  Before it's even pancaking, being blown up, you see the blast sometimes as much as two seconds before.
[02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:10.251]  I videotaped it from the day I just looked at the video.
[02:34:10.291 --> 02:34:11.211]  No, you don't see that.
[02:34:11.631 --> 02:34:12.571]  I mean, this is the problem.
[02:34:12.651 --> 02:34:14.692]  I don't know what video you're talking about, sir.
[02:34:15.052 --> 02:34:18.532]  We have blasts going out, in some cases, ten floors below.
[02:34:18.552 --> 02:34:20.673]  No, that's exactly what you don't see.
[02:34:21.073 --> 02:34:25.518]  If you were, if you had a controlled demolition, you see floors that are completely undisturbed.
[02:34:25.558 --> 02:34:27.160]  You're just, you know, I don't think you're stupid.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:30.044]  I think you're just trying to put doubts in people's minds, sir.
[02:34:30.344 --> 02:34:33.047]  And by the way, we've proven this controlled demolition.
[02:34:33.067 --> 02:34:34.689]  You can keep stating that we haven't.
[02:34:35.250 --> 02:34:36.191]  I will just state this.
[02:34:36.551 --> 02:34:38.754]  We have the public officials who are not to fly.
[02:34:38.794 --> 02:34:40.997]  We have the PNAC boys saying they need a terror attack.
[02:34:41.457 --> 02:34:47.582]  We have the NORAD drills, that's why NORAD stood down with the CIA, targeting the exact same places at the exact same times.
[02:34:47.942 --> 02:34:50.544]  We have the official Northwoods plan to carry out these types of attacks.
[02:34:50.884 --> 02:34:56.708]  We have the CIA operations like AJAX, where they declassified that our government stages terror attacks.
[02:34:57.169 --> 02:34:59.150]  That's why you and your guys have got a big problem.
[02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:01.612]  No, because you're arguing about the possible.
[02:35:01.952 --> 02:35:03.993]  Because something could have happened, therefore it did.
[02:35:04.213 --> 02:35:05.114]  That's a logical fallacy.
[02:35:05.154 --> 02:35:05.634]  No, no, no.
[02:35:05.674 --> 02:35:08.836]  Sir, the government admits it's carried out terror attacks.
[02:35:08.916 --> 02:35:10.657]  He talks about logical fallacies, Alex.
[02:35:10.677 --> 02:35:16.300]  He commits a beauty in this article, and I pointed it out to him already online before he published it.
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:21.623]  Namely, he says, because different conspiracy theories are inconsistent with one another, they must all be false.
[02:35:22.062 --> 02:35:24.684]  But the only inference you can follow is that they can't all be true.
[02:35:24.824 --> 02:35:25.844]  One of them could be true.
[02:35:26.465 --> 02:35:37.132]  That's why I'm saying, if you have a theory of the speed of light, and just because ten people are wrong about their theory, including the government's story, one of them is right.
[02:35:37.272 --> 02:35:47.358]  So yeah, to say, because there's an argument, every form of science and research and, you know, detectives at a cop shop, they're going to be disagreeing, but somebody's going to be right.
[02:35:47.818 --> 02:35:50.360]  See, I pointed out to Professor Fetzer online that
[02:35:51.199 --> 02:35:55.503]  They claim to have evidence proving all of these different inconsistent theories.
[02:35:55.903 --> 02:35:59.806]  And if there is evidence proving all of them... That's interpretive!
[02:35:59.846 --> 02:36:01.268]  That's interpretive!
[02:36:01.288 --> 02:36:06.332]  I pointed out to him that that's also a fallacy because if you only take part of the evidence you can prove one.
[02:36:06.512 --> 02:36:08.453]  You have to take into account all the relevant evidence.
[02:36:08.473 --> 02:36:12.337]  He's a master at what's called special pleading and taking only part of the evidence.
[02:36:12.357 --> 02:36:13.558]  He's committed another blunder.
[02:36:13.598 --> 02:36:17.701]  This guy could not get through a critical thinking class that I teach to our freshmen.
[02:36:18.078 --> 02:36:21.502]  Well, I hope you take that course, because you can't stay on one topic.
[02:36:21.522 --> 02:36:35.737]  Well, sir, can you specifically, going back to Jones, can you specifically tell us where, well, number one, you are saying here that he agreed with the overthrow of the government, and I've watched those tapes over and over again.
[02:36:35.797 --> 02:36:36.939]  I never saw that or heard that.
[02:36:37.179 --> 02:36:38.981]  Can you specifically tell me what Jones said?
[02:36:39.921 --> 02:36:44.904]  Yes, he was asked, is there a way to achieve our goals without a violent overthrow?
[02:36:45.064 --> 02:36:55.909]  He then echoed the Declaration of Independence preamble which is a call for revolution by deliberately echoing the language and format which is an argument for revolution
[02:36:56.300 --> 02:37:00.081]  And then ended up saying, there is no peaceful way to achieve our means.
[02:37:00.221 --> 02:37:02.161]  This is completely false and misleading.
[02:37:02.221 --> 02:37:03.721]  He said we have to follow the Constitution.
[02:37:03.741 --> 02:37:06.222]  Well, we're going to get the exact clip and we're going to post it.
[02:37:06.742 --> 02:37:14.143]  We're doing a big story on this because, you know, this goes into the psychology of people like Mr. Mosley.
[02:37:14.163 --> 02:37:16.244]  But again, I can't help but appreciate him.
[02:37:16.584 --> 02:37:20.764]  Jim, at least he will come on and debate us and go head to head with us.
[02:37:20.784 --> 02:37:21.785]  But what about this?
[02:37:21.885 --> 02:37:24.305]  After debating these characters extensively,
[02:37:24.885 --> 02:37:27.406]  And then the first person you talk about is me, Alex Jones.
[02:37:27.726 --> 02:37:29.506]  You have never talked to me, Mr. Mosley.
[02:37:29.766 --> 02:37:34.887]  I don't spend my time trolling around on message boards, and frankly, I wish Fetzer and others wouldn't.
[02:37:34.927 --> 02:37:36.087]  It's a complete waste of time.
[02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:41.588]  But I'm trying to understand here why you're implying that you debated me.
[02:37:41.868 --> 02:37:45.009]  You've been included on almost all of the emails back and forth.
[02:37:45.029 --> 02:37:48.890]  I don't know if you've read them or choose to participate, but mostly by others.
[02:37:50.376 --> 02:37:52.977]  Well, if you put your name on a list, then you're included in the debate.
[02:37:53.057 --> 02:37:54.018]  I didn't put your name.
[02:37:54.078 --> 02:37:56.999]  I mean, Mr. Fetzer and his colleagues put your name on the list.
[02:37:57.219 --> 02:37:57.580]  I didn't.
[02:37:57.820 --> 02:37:59.721]  I didn't put Alex's name on the list.
[02:37:59.981 --> 02:38:01.302]  You're making this stuff up.
[02:38:01.322 --> 02:38:03.062]  You just make this stuff up as you go along.
[02:38:03.142 --> 02:38:04.923]  Could we actually debate for a moment?
[02:38:05.824 --> 02:38:06.164]  You know what?
[02:38:06.204 --> 02:38:11.166]  You get a minute, then Jim gets a minute, and then I want to go to Barry Homish, if he's still there, to get a comment.
[02:38:11.186 --> 02:38:11.887]  But go ahead.
[02:38:12.207 --> 02:38:14.708]  Okay, the structure here is we have a thesis.
[02:38:14.788 --> 02:38:15.969]  We have to stay on the topic.
[02:38:16.369 --> 02:38:22.338]  Professor Fetzer is a master at tap dancing around and changing the topic when he gets caught.
[02:38:22.739 --> 02:38:27.646]  The thesis is, structural steel fails under the temperatures of ordinary fires.
[02:38:28.006 --> 02:38:31.592]  The McCormick Place was a 1960 building just like the World Trade Center.
[02:38:32.165 --> 02:38:34.586]  It did not have to bear the load of 110 floors.
[02:38:34.606 --> 02:38:36.127]  It was a heavy steel building.
[02:38:36.147 --> 02:38:38.808]  It was the premier exhibition hall in America.
[02:38:39.168 --> 02:38:42.050]  And under ordinary fire, in 30 minutes, the steel failed.
[02:38:42.430 --> 02:38:51.454]  Now, the issue... You're talking about a lightly built convention center that has an umbrella roof and is not a heavy supportive structure.
[02:38:51.494 --> 02:38:58.177]  Those things are outward husk and then have a light topping, cheap construction.
[02:38:58.217 --> 02:38:59.058]  Everybody knows that.
[02:38:59.318 --> 02:39:01.259]  I can't believe you're trying this argument, but go ahead.
[02:39:01.599 --> 02:39:02.920]  Stay on the topic.
[02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:06.222]  The topic is... No, I've studied that building!
[02:39:06.242 --> 02:39:07.663]  You guys always use that building!
[02:39:07.803 --> 02:39:08.784]  That's ridiculous!
[02:39:09.244 --> 02:39:15.688]  Is the temperature of an ordinary fire sufficient to weaken and compromise structural steel?
[02:39:15.889 --> 02:39:16.649]  Answer, yes.
[02:39:16.729 --> 02:39:17.249]  No, it's not.
[02:39:17.350 --> 02:39:18.790]  Okay, let's have Fetzer counter that.
[02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:19.251]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:39:19.271 --> 02:39:20.131]  That's completely false.
[02:39:20.171 --> 02:39:23.333]  The melting point of structural steel is 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:39:23.714 --> 02:39:26.616]  The highest temperature a jet-based fuel fire can attain is 1,800 degrees.
[02:39:26.636 --> 02:39:28.617]  There's a thousand degree difference.
[02:39:28.942 --> 02:39:33.885]  The Underwriters Laboratory certified the steel used in the towers to 2000 degrees up to 6 hours.
[02:39:34.245 --> 02:39:36.127]  The temperatures never got anywhere near there.
[02:39:36.207 --> 02:39:38.308]  They estimated closer to 500 degrees.
[02:39:38.688 --> 02:39:39.629]  This is completely...
[02:39:40.443 --> 02:39:41.004]  Ridiculous.
[02:39:41.064 --> 02:39:48.009]  In fact, there was a fire in 1975 in the North Tower on the 13th of February that burned much hotter and much longer.
[02:39:48.390 --> 02:39:49.570]  I've got to add this.
[02:39:49.611 --> 02:40:05.283]  There were the firefighters reported that in both towers the fires were almost out and to call up more ladders to save the people and there were people standing in the holes for minutes waiting for help without burning or without being singed
[02:40:05.763 --> 02:40:14.345]  Begging for helicopter rescue that never came inches away from pillars that seconds later as they talked on cell phones blew up.
[02:40:14.865 --> 02:40:16.966]  Now go ahead, we gotta give him some time.
[02:40:17.286 --> 02:40:19.646]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Jonathan.
[02:40:19.946 --> 02:40:27.988]  The same underwriters lab in their study of World Trade Center cited McCormick Place and a dozen other steel structures that have partially or completely failed.
[02:40:28.399 --> 02:40:32.662]  For the proposition, in Underwriters Lab's view, that structural steel does melt.
[02:40:32.682 --> 02:40:36.984]  No, they told the engineers that did the study to shut up and lie, and they wouldn't do it, so they got fired.
[02:40:37.385 --> 02:40:44.049]  Nope, the Underwriters Lab, because Mr. Fetzer, Professor Fetzer, Professor Fetzer is again changing the subject.
[02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:45.830]  Nobody is melting steel.
[02:40:46.210 --> 02:40:51.914]  The issue, does it bend and expand so it shears bolts, breaks connectors, warps the structure?
[02:40:51.954 --> 02:40:53.035]  It doesn't have to melt.
[02:40:53.155 --> 02:40:55.096]  This was a welded
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:59.323]  It's a steel structure with an intricate lattice, redundant support system.
[02:40:59.523 --> 02:41:00.865]  It was very sophisticated.
[02:41:01.005 --> 02:41:04.648]  It cannot have suffered from a pancake kind of collapse.
[02:41:05.068 --> 02:41:12.795]  I got a structural engineer on this website to correct him on McCormick Place and on the capacity of the Twin Towers to subject to pancake collapse.
[02:41:12.835 --> 02:41:13.956]  He simply ignores it.
[02:41:14.296 --> 02:41:21.643]  When this guy is corrected, he just goes ahead and repeats his own phony arguments, whether they commit equivocation or logical blunders or no matter what.
[02:41:22.017 --> 02:41:27.861]  He has the mind of a 15-year-old and he's obsessed to prove himself correct, no matter how wrong he may be.
[02:41:28.261 --> 02:41:30.502]  Look, because Professor Fetz comes back with DREC.
[02:41:30.863 --> 02:41:33.884]  He talks about melting steel instead of structural collapse.
[02:41:34.065 --> 02:41:40.949]  Well, sir, listen, the University of Edinburgh, with their top engineers, for a month every day,
[02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:42.130]  I'm going to stop you.
[02:42:02.987 --> 02:42:12.252]  And there are a lot of other engineers saying this, Kevin Ryan is saying this, countless others are saying this, and I don't understand how... Listen, it's been well known that buildings are the same.
[02:42:12.292 --> 02:42:17.174]  Listen, listen, listen, Edinburgh's doing these tests because they say this changes insurance everything.
[02:42:17.434 --> 02:42:31.021]  If buildings will suddenly collapse from kerosene, coal-burning fuel, black, burning, you know, smoke, low-oxygen flames, and you can run through this stuff, if this is the case, then the laws of physics have been suspended.
[02:42:31.081 --> 02:42:31.421]  Go ahead.
[02:42:31.681 --> 02:42:35.523]  Did they hit it with 104 tons of aircraft traveling 540 miles per hour?
[02:42:35.543 --> 02:42:39.846]  If that was the case, it would have happened by the time the fires hit their peak level.
[02:42:39.986 --> 02:42:43.028]  The fires had already diminished by over 90 percent!
[02:42:43.328 --> 02:42:45.589]  See, he knows these arguments are phony.
[02:42:45.809 --> 02:42:47.190]  He knows these arguments are phony.
[02:42:47.250 --> 02:42:57.276]  I've pointed out repeatedly that Frank DiMartini, who was the construction manager on the World Trade Center, had observed that they were designed to withstand the impact of the largest then commercial airliner, Boeing 707.
[02:42:57.316 --> 02:42:57.756]  Two of them!
[02:42:58.993 --> 02:43:02.916]  Yeah, whose impact, he said, would be analogous to sticking a pencil through mosquito netting.
[02:43:02.956 --> 02:43:08.360]  Now, this guy either doesn't know any better, in which case he's incompetent, or he knows better, in which case he's corrupt.
[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:09.460]  There are no alternatives.
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:10.881]  He's either incompetent or corrupt.
[02:43:10.901 --> 02:43:19.187]  Namuru Namasaki, the designer of the towers, went on record saying they could take multiple jumbo jet hits.
[02:43:19.568 --> 02:43:20.788]  Nobody tested that, did they?
[02:43:21.529 --> 02:43:22.510]  And a Boeing 707 is half the math.
[02:43:25.839 --> 02:43:33.986]  Sir, do you understand the molecular nature of aluminum when it hits giant steel columns and concrete?
[02:43:34.066 --> 02:43:35.007]  It's a joke, sir!
[02:43:35.968 --> 02:43:36.228]  Yeah.
[02:43:36.388 --> 02:43:43.615]  And do you understand the bomb effect of 30,000 kilograms of jet fuel going off in the middle, in the center of the building as a gigantic bomb?
[02:43:43.655 --> 02:43:43.875]  It did!
[02:43:43.995 --> 02:43:47.578]  Most of that fuel burned off in the giant fireball that's burning over there.
[02:43:47.658 --> 02:43:48.579]  Hold on.
[02:43:48.759 --> 02:43:59.028]  They've done analysis, sir, of the pounds per square inch pressure generated by that fuel detonating, and it is thousands of times too weak to even blow out the smallest columns.
[02:43:59.068 --> 02:43:59.869]  That's ridiculous.
[02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:05.496]  We know exactly how much C4 it takes, properly jacketed, to cut columns.
[02:44:05.516 --> 02:44:06.598]  This is hard to do.
[02:44:06.918 --> 02:44:13.567]  Look at Dr. Frank Greening's extensive and excellent article, which analyzes all the energy on this.
[02:44:13.687 --> 02:44:16.851]  And if you have a gigantic bomb going off in the center of the building,
[02:44:17.253 --> 02:44:21.737]  From 30,000 kilograms, that's 30 tons of jet fuel exploding.
[02:44:22.058 --> 02:44:24.060]  You're mangling the entire interior.
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:30.746]  Yeah, you would have had that damage, even if you believe your phony science, and then it would have broken off or slumped or bent.
[02:44:30.826 --> 02:44:34.790]  It wouldn't go boom, boom, boom, and blow off in clear little easy sections.
[02:44:34.850 --> 02:44:35.831]  Is Barry Homish still there?
[02:44:37.253 --> 02:44:38.234]  Hold on just a second, guys.
[02:44:38.294 --> 02:44:39.134]  Is Barry Homish still there?
[02:44:40.590 --> 02:44:43.373]  Barry Homish is a writer written for major papers in Israel.
[02:44:43.393 --> 02:44:44.494]  I believe he's here in the U.S.
[02:44:44.634 --> 02:44:45.995]  and I'm just going to give him a minute or so.
[02:44:46.036 --> 02:44:48.438]  I don't even know what subject he's calling in on.
[02:44:48.698 --> 02:44:51.781]  Then I'll let both of you gentlemen continue to the end of the hour.
[02:44:51.801 --> 02:44:54.203]  Please stay with us, Fetzer and Mosley.
[02:44:54.724 --> 02:44:57.046]  Barry Chomish, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:44:57.066 --> 02:44:57.647]  What's on your mind?
[02:44:58.507 --> 02:45:00.548]  Yeah, I was helped on, actually.
[02:45:00.929 --> 02:45:12.415]  Look, the business of Jews and 9-11 and all that... Look, the architect of the World Trade Center is on my email list.
[02:45:13.155 --> 02:45:15.476]  He's been writing me for the last four years.
[02:45:16.057 --> 02:45:21.440]  Now, he always had difficulties with it, but now he's coming out and going public.
[02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:23.701]  His name is Aaron Swirsky.
[02:45:24.621 --> 02:45:35.632]  Uh, he lives in Netanya, and now he, um, he's just saying that we designed the building to take any sort of a plane, and he doesn't believe the planes brought it down.
[02:45:36.053 --> 02:45:36.853]  And what's his name?
[02:45:37.354 --> 02:45:39.095]  His name is Aaron Swirsky.
[02:45:39.696 --> 02:45:41.157]  He lives in Netanya.
[02:45:42.038 --> 02:45:44.581]  Um, as I said, I've been corresponding with him for years.
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:49.802]  Barry Shumish, I've been meaning to get you on the air, and we finally got your number.
[02:45:49.882 --> 02:45:53.404]  Let me get your number again as backup, and then try to give me his email.
[02:45:53.444 --> 02:45:54.465]  I'd like to interview him now.
[02:45:54.685 --> 02:45:58.968]  I know we have chief engineers, the chief designer, Yamasaki.
[02:45:59.408 --> 02:46:04.031]  What area of design would Aaron Swartzky be involved in?
[02:46:04.491 --> 02:46:06.072]  I've got to get you his number.
[02:46:06.533 --> 02:46:11.136]  If I have to, I'll phone Israel and get it for you, and we'll see what he says.
[02:46:12.216 --> 02:46:20.301]  What do you think about Jonathan Mosley saying that he doesn't believe there was any government involvement?
[02:46:21.172 --> 02:46:22.433]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[02:46:23.313 --> 02:46:31.036]  Look, the fact of the matter is there are ties to Israel, and one of the most disturbing is Menachem Atzmon.
[02:46:32.057 --> 02:46:36.639]  During the 1980s, the Likud party had two accountants.
[02:46:37.179 --> 02:46:39.700]  One was Menachem Atzmon, the other one was Ehud Olmert.
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:44.222]  Atzmon was head of security for Logan and Newark airports.
[02:46:45.462 --> 02:46:46.923]  Uh, on September 11th.
[02:46:46.983 --> 02:46:49.624]  He determined who got on planes and who didn't.
[02:46:49.644 --> 02:46:54.586]  Well, I know Haratz reported that Odigo did indeed warn his employees.
[02:46:54.606 --> 02:46:55.546]  That's not an urban legend.
[02:46:55.726 --> 02:46:56.406]  That's from Israel.
[02:46:56.426 --> 02:46:59.167]  But I personally don't believe Israel could carry it out.
[02:46:59.207 --> 02:47:01.048]  But I certainly believe they knew what was going on.
[02:47:01.068 --> 02:47:02.629]  It's not just Israel.
[02:47:03.089 --> 02:47:06.350]  We had a war, uh, supposedly over
[02:47:07.010 --> 02:47:24.899]  We have a guy named Seymour Hersh claiming that the CFR, the so-called neocons, approved the war and that Israel took the air for two and a half weeks with no ground troops to see what it would be like to bomb Iraq.
[02:47:25.619 --> 02:47:30.524]  And we're getting all terrible, terrible, lots of younger ladies.
[02:47:30.564 --> 02:47:31.745]  Barry, I've got to leave you there.
[02:47:33.467 --> 02:47:34.388]  Let me get you on as a guest.
[02:47:34.428 --> 02:47:35.028]  Great journalist.
[02:47:35.529 --> 02:47:37.551]  Get his number because I know he's traveling around right now.
[02:47:37.871 --> 02:47:40.314]  Form me Scott and we'll get him on next week if we can.
[02:47:40.334 --> 02:47:41.054]  Thank you, Barry.
[02:47:41.575 --> 02:47:44.017]  We're going to go out of break to a final segment with both our guests.
[02:47:44.037 --> 02:47:45.599]  We appreciate them both being here with us.
[02:47:45.839 --> 02:47:48.421]  Jonathan Mosley, I'm going to let you take us out of this segment.
[02:47:48.441 --> 02:47:48.702]  Go ahead.
[02:47:49.282 --> 02:47:51.465]  Well again, there are hundreds of alerts every year.
[02:47:51.485 --> 02:47:52.947]  This is what bothers me.
[02:47:52.987 --> 02:47:56.170]  People are constantly being warned that there's chatter or something like that.
[02:47:56.190 --> 02:48:00.876]  The fact that some security person got it from authorities and passed it down, that's happening constantly.
[02:48:01.396 --> 02:48:02.598]  And was always happening constantly.
[02:48:02.618 --> 02:48:06.342]  But the media then tried to claim that it was just an urban legend and no one was warned.
[02:48:06.362 --> 02:48:07.664]  Why didn't they just say what you just said?
[02:48:08.576 --> 02:48:14.420]  Well, I don't know, but I remember hearing warnings during the summer of 2001, before anyone knew there was going to be a 9-11.
[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:16.182]  Yeah, for me, probably.
[02:48:17.623 --> 02:48:18.783]  Stay there, both of you.
[02:48:18.823 --> 02:48:26.269]  Final segment with Jim Fetzer and our guest Jonathan Mosley, who wrote this savage hit piece on myself.
[02:48:26.869 --> 02:48:27.710]  But I think it's great.
[02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:32.013]  They're going to go to my website, InfoWars.com, and they're going to find out the truth.
[02:48:32.685 --> 02:48:34.426]  They're going to join us to defend this republic.
[02:48:34.846 --> 02:48:38.268]  I know it's hard to believe our government did this, but it's not our government.
[02:48:38.288 --> 02:48:38.969]  It's globalists.
[02:48:39.009 --> 02:48:41.650]  They're the same ones getting rid of our borders right now.
[02:48:42.271 --> 02:48:43.772]  The same ones giving away our ports.
[02:48:46.173 --> 02:48:49.475]  It's here.
[02:48:49.655 --> 02:48:54.438]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.818 --> 02:49:02.423]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.151 --> 02:49:10.195]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.595 --> 02:49:22.022]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.322 --> 02:49:25.844]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.304 --> 02:49:28.225]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.566 --> 02:49:32.388]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.019 --> 02:49:49.181]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:49:49.221 --> 02:49:53.264]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:49:53.404 --> 02:49:55.965]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:49:56.025 --> 02:49:58.347]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:49:58.547 --> 02:50:06.972]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:50:07.052 --> 02:50:08.353]  The brookie light is different.
[02:50:08.513 --> 02:50:11.715]  Water molecules take minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:50:11.715 --> 02:50:12.216]  We're good to go!

[02:50:43.463 --> 02:50:44.604]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:31.497 --> 02:51:34.579]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.739 --> 02:51:40.604]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:59.352 --> 02:52:00.152]  Stop the Terror!
[02:52:00.192 --> 02:52:01.373]  Stop the people who carried out 9-11.
[02:52:01.713 --> 02:52:04.074]  We're carrying the new book, The Terror Conspiracy, by Jim Mars.
[02:52:04.114 --> 02:52:06.095]  You can't even get it for, what, 20 days?
[02:52:06.135 --> 02:52:08.456]  Then it'll be on bookstore shelves nationwide.
[02:52:08.496 --> 02:52:11.018]  And my new film, Terror Storm, get it at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:11.058 --> 02:52:15.420]  The official final DVD is out with the 66 minutes of extras, including...
[02:52:16.446 --> 02:52:23.012]  Well, I think that Mosley's last point well illustrates his incapacity to come to grips with the facts in this matter.
[02:52:39.665 --> 02:52:47.791]  The plane that actually hit the building was very different than the 707s that they were designed to accommodate, and in fact, precisely the opposite is the case.
[02:52:47.871 --> 02:52:49.312]  I routinely lecture on this.
[02:52:49.752 --> 02:53:02.521]  The physical properties, the mass, and even the fuel capacity of these planes are very comparable, and I found at least three other engineers who agreed with Frank DiMartini that the buildings were constructed to withstand the impact of those airliners.
[02:53:03.072 --> 02:53:09.858]  His point here is either deliberately deceiving us or he's utterly incompetent because he has no familiarity with the facts of the case.
[02:53:10.118 --> 02:53:11.099]  Well, I mean, let's ask him.
[02:53:11.159 --> 02:53:12.060]  Why are you doing this?
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:15.643]  I think he's told us he doesn't believe the story we put out.
[02:53:15.663 --> 02:53:17.304]  I guess he believes the official story.
[02:53:17.744 --> 02:53:20.827]  I know when he says that there's one official story, that is not the case.
[02:53:20.867 --> 02:53:23.730]  The government constantly is changing its story.
[02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:26.332]  Maybe Jonathan's missed that.
[02:53:26.392 --> 02:53:27.453]  Jonathan, your comments?
[02:53:28.273 --> 02:53:36.037]  Well, the Boeing website reports the mass fully loaded as being double for the aircraft that hit the World Trade Center than a 707.
[02:53:36.837 --> 02:53:44.581]  And the theory in the 60s was that an aircraft going around 180 miles an hour lost from the airport might hit it.
[02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:51.585]  Uh, philosophy professor, Fitzer, apparently doesn't know that the kinetic energy increases with the square of speed.
[02:53:51.865 --> 02:54:08.377]  Well, listen, you're a lawyer, he's a professor, we all have rights to have our views and study, but you keep implying by saying he's a philosophy professor that we don't have a bunch of scientists trained in engineering and physics that have come to the same conclusion.
[02:54:09.217 --> 02:54:14.601]  He appears not even to know that my PhD is in the history of science and the philosophy of science, the history of science.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.221]  This is what Kevin Ryan said, and we'll get to the bottom of it.
[02:54:39.784 --> 02:54:50.552]  He's emailed WorldNetDaily and has said of the numerous false statements made in the article by John Mosley that you recently published, at least one should remain and result in legal action.
[02:54:50.592 --> 02:54:59.038]  Anyone who actually listened to the C-SPAN broadcast and 9-11 Scholars Group can clearly hear that Mosley's quote of Stephen Jones is inaccurate, to say the least.
[02:54:59.634 --> 02:55:07.579]  Dr. Jones did not say that there is no peaceful way to achieve the group's goals and Dr. Jones has not promoted violence in any of his presentations.
[02:55:07.999 --> 02:55:11.141]  A correction of this libelous error might be wise choice.
[02:55:11.461 --> 02:55:15.543]  Thanks Kevin Ryan, UL Laboratories former underwriter engineer.
[02:55:15.903 --> 02:55:17.704]  You want to comment to his email he's put out?
[02:55:17.724 --> 02:55:19.545]  Millions of people saw it.
[02:55:20.996 --> 02:55:27.680]  I think this guy ought to be reported to the Board of Ethics that in his domain, this is completely unethical and corrupt behavior.
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:33.663]  Well, Mr. Professor Fetzer repeatedly says that the weight of one floor is not enough to bring down subsequent floors.
[02:55:33.723 --> 02:55:37.945]  No, in full note, well, the 29 floors, the 35 floors... Mostly you're jumping around.
[02:55:37.965 --> 02:55:40.306]  We're talking about Steve Jones and your libel of him.
[02:55:40.466 --> 02:55:41.387]  I was there, buddy.
[02:55:41.427 --> 02:55:42.648]  He didn't say what you claimed.
[02:55:42.848 --> 02:55:48.391]  We're talking about why the University of Minnesota should fire you, Mr. Professor Fetzer, because you're specifically lying.
[02:55:49.111 --> 02:55:51.152]  Well, I didn't get to debate or say much here.
[02:55:51.212 --> 02:55:52.812]  I guess you might, especially on Thermite.
[02:56:15.978 --> 02:56:17.460]  You've got probably 20 minutes to talk.
[02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:18.661]  That's not fair.
[02:56:18.701 --> 02:56:19.622]  You've got to save plenty.
[02:56:19.942 --> 02:56:21.264]  Well, listen, you can come back on.
[02:56:21.324 --> 02:56:22.605]  We'll set you back up next week.
[02:56:23.326 --> 02:56:24.027]  God bless, folks.
