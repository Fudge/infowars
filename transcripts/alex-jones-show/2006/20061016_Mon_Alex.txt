[00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.722]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.382 --> 00:00:11.202]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:12.863]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:17.224]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:21.825]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:28.627]  Mega massive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:32.288]  We don't have any
[00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:34.939]  Yes, that is full-length guest.
[00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:44.063]  We do have Michael Rivero, who lives in Hawaii, joining us for just a little five-minute report after this first segment comes to its conclusion.
[00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:54.328]  To give us an eyewitness account of just how bad the storm, or cluster, it's being called a storm, of earthquakes yesterday.
[00:00:54.368 --> 00:00:57.610]  Exactly what that's done to the island, though it is a volcanic
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.362]  Island where two tectonic plates collide there in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in one of the most active areas of the Great Ring of Fire.
[00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:15.304]  We will get a update from the islands coming up in exactly six minutes from now.
[00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:19.705]  We'll be coming out of break for the second segment and have Michael Rivero graciously on with us.
[00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:20.906]  And I think it's what 6 a.m.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.521]  out there right now we call him at 5 a.m.
[00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:50.614]  and he was up and it was a quite an earthquake quite a group of earthquakes then we're not here to talk about ourselves but we are here to analyze the hit pieces against us because we can understand the enemy's operations we understand their programming their propaganda Rush Limbaugh I now have learned attacked me last Thursday off and on for an hour
[00:01:52.751 --> 00:02:00.797]  And of course he called for the evil alternative press to be arrested as Bill O'Reilly did last Thursday.
[00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:02.878]  Must have been the talking point that day.
[00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.480]  They're now all saying it.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.461]  It was Michael Savage a couple years ago saying it.
[00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.884]  Now they're all saying it in unison.
[00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.245]  I kind of dropped the ball last Friday.
[00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.527]  I played much of the five minute clip.
[00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:26.147]  of Professor Fetzer on Fox being attacked Thursday night and covered eight different points of lies and distortions by Bill O'Reilly as Jack Blood calls him.
[00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:33.293]  Here on the network, here on the Genesis Network, he coined the term Bill O'Reilly and it really is true.
[00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:40.019]  Bill O'Bully would also be a nice term for Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. O'Reilly
[00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:56.943]  I got sped up, ran out of time, didn't get to the last part that was the key, but we did write an article about it Friday, Paul Watson did, did a great job for PrisonPlanet.com, where he called for the FBI to go and arrest Mr. Fetzer.
[00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:06.327]  Which, we forget, with another professor in Florida, O'Reilly called for him to be arrested, said he was probably a terrorist.
[00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:08.208]  The FBI went and arrested him.
[00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:10.768]  He was found not guilty by a jury, because he was a U.S.
[00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:11.228]  citizen.
[00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.389]  Though the FBI tried to keep its, quote, evidence secret from the jury, just trust us, we have the evidence.
[00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.530]  That didn't work.
[00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:29.012]  The jury found him not guilty, but he lost his job and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers, and that's what they did to this Arab-American, Palestinian-American,
[00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:33.797]  Well, now Lord O'Reilly, this is a big deal.
[00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:38.120]  I mean, when national shows are saying, I'm going to put the FBI on you.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.161]  You need to be investigated.
[00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:45.444]  The same thing needs to happen to you that happened to this other professor, which is arrested, life ruined.
[00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:47.605]  Because we're cleaning their clocks.
[00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:49.326]  And why are we cleaning their clocks?
[00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:50.627]  Because you've been taking action.
[00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:52.708]  And here's the big story of the day.
[00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.729]  Limbaugh's coming up.
[00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.472]  I'm going to play the end of the O'Reilly-Bill O'Booley exchange.
[00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:01.160]  We're going to go through all the news.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.201]  Take your calls today.
[00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:06.107]  I've cancelled all the major guests so that we can have time to take your calls.
[00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:08.190]  I've been doing that last week because so much is happening.
[00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:10.533]  Scientific Poll!
[00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:11.294]  84% reject official 9-11 story.
[00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.267]  Again, hold on to your hats.
[00:04:16.447 --> 00:04:21.229]  I cannot stress with the English language how wonderful this is.
[00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:28.893]  I could give you a Rebel Yell or a Yahoo, maybe, and that might get you just some inkling of how exciting this is.
[00:04:29.593 --> 00:04:30.473]  All right!
[00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:31.454]  Yeah!
[00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:33.015]  Man, this is good!
[00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:34.555]  Yeah, this is a good sign!
[00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:36.176]  We're cleaning their clocks!
[00:04:37.137 --> 00:04:41.899]  When we get back, we'll go to Hawaii, put an update there, and then straight into our top story.
[00:04:42.902 --> 00:04:47.586]  Scientific poll, 84% reject official 9-11 story.
[00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:53.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, oh man, I'm getting chills, but I'm starting now, I'm getting chills.
[00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:54.851]  Oh, it feels good.
[00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:56.873]  Victory feels good.
[00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.949]  It's here!
[00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:09.911]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:17.973]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:25.696]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:32.958]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:37.509]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.311]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.712]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:47.954]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:11.027]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:22.517]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.857 --> 00:06:27.681]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:28.061]  I think?
[00:06:47.034 --> 00:06:50.117]  Get a two-pack, only $99, or a four-pack, only $188.
[00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:53.960]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.065]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:04.068]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:06.550]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.696]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:16.458]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:20.735]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:25.439]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:29.001]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.962 --> 00:07:32.884]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:36.066]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:38.047]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:47.522]  U.S.
[00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:50.504]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:59.368]  Call 888-XANADU, that's 888-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[00:08:01.108 --> 00:08:06.151]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:08.792]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:16.627]  Okay, Rush Limbaugh lied about this broadcast.
[00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:18.367]  Rush Limbaugh spun.
[00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:37.915]  He engaged in what fake conservatives like himself do best, and that is lie to their listeners to neutralize the conservative majority, to ensure you don't stand up against the North American Union, the New World Order, the attacks on sovereign countries, to make sure you don't learn that Bush was triple the size of the BATF.
[00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.757]  And so I'm going off on Rush Limbaugh today.
[00:08:43.152 --> 00:08:46.254]  We also learned who called me.
[00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:48.136]  Was it George Bush?
[00:08:48.216 --> 00:08:49.457]  Was it a famous comedian?
[00:08:49.477 --> 00:08:57.763]  That incredible call I got last Thursday afternoon that we aired Friday that sounds just like George Bush telling me, let's make a deal on 9-11.
[00:08:57.823 --> 00:08:59.684]  We learned who it was, what happened.
[00:08:59.704 --> 00:09:01.926]  You'll find out later in the next hour.
[00:09:02.827 --> 00:09:06.389]  Before this hour ends, I will play the Limbaugh savaging man.
[00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.691]  Again, building straw men.
[00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:14.868]  But right now, the incredible news, the exciting news, we'll get his take on this.
[00:09:15.428 --> 00:09:28.124]  One of our chief analysts here on the broadcast, we're always honored to have him once a month for about an hour and a half, but he joins us today under bad circumstances, unfortunately, the big earthquake that hit the main island, Hawaii.
[00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:39.888]  He's on one of the smaller islands, the island that's got Pearl Harbor on it, but he'll tell you all about that, but a cluster of quakes hitting the entire chain, but centering there in the main island of Hawaii.
[00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:43.249]  I don't claim to be an expert on this, he just filled me in during the break.
[00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:52.112]  And then we'll get Michael Rivero's take on the news that I cannot, again, words cannot stress how exciting this is.
[00:09:53.462 --> 00:10:02.884]  I predicted Saturday, it wasn't hard to do, that you wouldn't see a hundred news articles about it and top news stories every evening about it unless we pushed it into mainstream consciousness.
[00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:10.346]  They wanted to hype up the 36% because it still sounded like a minority believing 9-11 is a total inside job.
[00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:12.606]  Specifically, did the government or elements of it do it?
[00:10:13.526 --> 00:10:17.107]  That was the Scripps Howard News Service, 68% in that same poll believing there's a cover-up.
[00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:24.520]  Well, 84% believe they've been lied to and there's a cover-up and that Bush is lying about 9-11.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:24.520]  84%!
[00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:27.442]  So we'll get Michael Rivero's take on that.
[00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:30.303]  Michael, thank you for letting us... Well, I guess you were already up.
[00:10:30.323 --> 00:10:34.245]  My producer said you were up and at them at like 5.30 your time when we called you.
[00:10:34.985 --> 00:10:42.389]  Yeah, I tend to be up with the chickens, as they say, and early to bed and early to rise and all that, because so much of my business is on the mainland.
[00:10:42.729 --> 00:10:45.030]  And it makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise, too, I hear.
[00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:48.606]  Well, we're still waiting to see the results on that one.
[00:10:50.827 --> 00:10:52.627]  Michael Rivera again of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:10:52.647 --> 00:10:53.407]  You're there in Hawaii.
[00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:57.609]  Tell us where you are geographically there on the String of Islands and then tell us what really happened.
[00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:01.510]  Okay, well we live on the island of Oahu.
[00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:09.632]  We can see Pearl Harbor from our windows and yesterday morning we were working.
[00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:14.394]  We're professionally up against some deadlines and about just after 7 the first earthquake hit
[00:11:15.814 --> 00:11:21.720]  And for a lot of people who've never been through an earthquake, they weren't sure what was going on.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:28.927]  In fact, when it first started, the shaking felt like maybe our washing machine had broken or something because it was just going into the spin cycle.
[00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:36.535]  And then when the swaying started, you know, I realized it was an earthquake and my wife and I, we got into the frame of the front door.
[00:11:38.127 --> 00:11:45.589]  The wave train, there was a sharp rattle, some swaying, another sharp rattle, and we lost some stuff off the walls, relatively minor.
[00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:49.250]  But you weren't in the epicenter, though?
[00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.350]  No, no, no.
[00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:59.052]  We were about 150 miles from the epicenter here, but the quake was felt all the way out to Kauai, which is the furthest island out in the chain to the west.
[00:11:59.913 --> 00:12:05.434]  And about 10 minutes later, the power went down, and apparently this was a safety
[00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:14.701]  There are seismic alarms on the steam turbines to shut them down and to vent the boilers to prevent possibilities of explosion.
[00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:21.805]  And because the system has to be brought up slowly, there are still parts of Oahu right now that don't have their power back.
[00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:23.386]  How is the main island doing?
[00:12:24.947 --> 00:12:28.650]  The big island has gotten most of their power back now.
[00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.152]  The damage is, there's a lot of structural damage.
[00:12:32.212 --> 00:12:33.793]  They had some ceiling panels come down.
[00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:37.438]  In the hospital in Kona and they've evacuated portions of that.
[00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:42.504]  There was another long-term care facility that had to be evacuated because of structural damage.
[00:12:43.004 --> 00:12:47.429]  A lot of small buildings, sheds and stuff got torn off their foundations.
[00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:55.998]  Highways are closed because of landslides and rocks that are boulders that are coming down onto the road and they're still basically
[00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.452]  Getting that cleaned up.
[00:12:57.672 --> 00:13:02.695]  Overall, for a quake of this magnitude, I think we got off very lucky in terms of damage.
[00:13:02.735 --> 00:13:05.056]  There have been no deaths reported so far.
[00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:07.578]  Only a few injuries, things like broken arms and stuff.
[00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:14.803]  So, you know, compared to some other places with higher population densities, you know, we got off lucky.
[00:13:15.303 --> 00:13:21.627]  There was no tsunami because Hawaii's volcanoes are not involved with what's called a subduction zone.
[00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:24.929]  We tend not to get tsunamis from our Hawaiian earthquakes.
[00:13:25.684 --> 00:13:38.954]  There is a concern that in the area where the quake epicenter was located, there is a very sharp undersea escarpment, and if a subsequent quake were to dislodge a large amount of that, then we could see some wave activity.
[00:13:39.094 --> 00:13:46.440]  Sure, the main thing that causes the tsunamis, for those that don't know, is you've got two plates running against each other, and if a mountain caves in,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.341]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:49.903]  And we don't have that here in Hawaii.
[00:13:49.923 --> 00:13:52.285]  Our volcanoes are caused by what's called a hot spot.
[00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:08.825]  Underneath the ocean floor.
[00:14:09.406 --> 00:14:17.853]  So, we'll get tsunamis in Hawaii that are caused by quakes in other parts of the Pacific, but generally Hawaiian quakes do not cause tsunamis.
[00:14:18.313 --> 00:14:20.995]  Where is the main bathyleth, or the main magma chamber?
[00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:23.838]  Is it right under the Big Island, or are there several magma chambers?
[00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:31.984]  It's one big chamber, and it's deep in the Earth's crust as the Pacific Ocean slides over it.
[00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:36.348]  And that's why you have this long chain of island remnants going out to Midway Island.
[00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:46.008]  Right now, the main magma chamber is underneath the southern edge of the Big Island, and as a matter of fact, a new island is already in the process of being formed.
[00:14:46.629 --> 00:15:00.239]  It's called Loihi, and it has not broken the surface of the water yet, but it's there on the floor of the ocean, and it's growing, and all the realtors are along the southern edge of the Big Island with their open house signs ready to plant as soon as it pokes up through the water.
[00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:02.826]  Amazing.
[00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:04.847]  It's so beautiful out there.
[00:15:04.867 --> 00:15:06.088]  I've never had a chance to be out there.
[00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:08.090]  Well, we're glad that nobody was killed.
[00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:16.737]  And I guess folks that live out there just accept the fact that you are living in this wondrous world of change on top of volcanic islands.
[00:15:16.777 --> 00:15:19.900]  So, I mean, I've heard that the Hawaiians are just taking it in stride.
[00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:25.743]  Well, they're taking in stride, although quakes of this magnitude are not all that common.
[00:15:25.763 --> 00:15:28.185]  This is the strongest one we've had in two decades.
[00:15:28.245 --> 00:15:31.869]  It's brought back a lot of memories of the 1983 and 1989 quakes.
[00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:35.312]  So it caught a lot of us by surprise.
[00:15:35.752 --> 00:15:42.278]  My wife and I certainly had thought we'd left this sort of thing behind us in Southern California, but apparently not.
[00:15:42.978 --> 00:15:44.640]  Out of the fire, into the furnace.
[00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:54.014]  Something like that, but there have been no major aftershocks over last night or this morning, so I think we're kind of through this one.
[00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:54.995]  Fantastic!
[00:15:55.035 --> 00:16:00.737]  Let's shift gears, if I can, and I'll let you get back to work there in the early morning hours, 6.15 a.m.
[00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:02.598]  there, Hawaii time in the Pacific.
[00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:10.402]  Scientific poll, 84% reject official 9-11 story, only 16% now believe official fable.
[00:16:10.842 --> 00:16:13.944]  According to a scientific New York Times CBS News poll,
[00:16:14.947 --> 00:16:18.871]  By Angus and Reed, one of the top three polling agencies in the western world.
[00:16:18.931 --> 00:16:19.712]  Very respected.
[00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:23.335]  And it says, Truth Movement now has a huge majority of opinion.
[00:16:23.675 --> 00:16:25.117]  How will the Bush Cabal react?
[00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:29.661]  And I love what you said at What Really Happened, your comment under our story that you linked to, Michael.
[00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:35.587]  You said... The other 16% are walking organ donors with no brains.
[00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:36.528]  Exactly.
[00:16:36.608 --> 00:16:39.871]  So 16% are brain dead and have no clue, basically.
[00:16:40.902 --> 00:17:01.436]  Well, you know, I'm just being flip and call it post-quake, you know, orneriness, but the reality is this is a very, very significant result and it does show that Americans have grown a very healthy degree of skepticism in viewing what they're being told by the government and by the mainstream media.
[00:17:02.296 --> 00:17:08.080]  And it does show that they are turning to alternative sources such as your radio show and websites like mine
[00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:11.161]  To get an alternative view of what's going on.
[00:17:11.982 --> 00:17:26.295]  And I see this as a very positive thing, but as you point out, President Bush and his neocons have to be viewing this latest development with a great deal of alarm, especially only a couple of weeks before a highly contentious election.
[00:17:28.394 --> 00:17:40.138]  My concern right now is, I am seeing indications that the voting against the incumbency is going to be so strong that even the vote fraud may not be able to counter it.
[00:17:40.738 --> 00:17:46.740]  And we might realistically see control of both houses of Congress shift to the Democrats.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.721]  At that point, I think we're going to see Bush, if that does happen, I think Bush is going to hit the panic button.
[00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:57.363]  And the panic button will be Chicago getting nuked, attacking Iran, what do you see?
[00:17:58.104 --> 00:18:00.446]  Well, it's kind of hard to predict.
[00:18:00.506 --> 00:18:04.028]  I'm sure they're thinking of what can they do that the American people would believe.
[00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:09.873]  Blowing up the Golden Gate Bridge, having a guy drive out there in a truck full of C4 and detonate it.
[00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:14.696]  Of course, it's a remote-controlled truck, but they'll have a guy with a beard and a face on five minutes in.
[00:18:15.837 --> 00:18:23.623]  Well, it has to be something that justifies not letting the new Congress take office in January, and that's the tricky part, because another terrorist attack
[00:18:24.398 --> 00:18:42.404]  uh... doesn't justify forbidding the new congress to take office so would have to be something perhaps in washington dc itself like uh... you know uh... congress gets hit with a huge anthrax attack and bush declares uh... state of national emergency in which he's running everything without any congress at all well that's right because
[00:18:44.068 --> 00:18:47.490]  No, I mean, that's right, because the anthrax attack was launched by the White House.
[00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.650]  We know that from the evidence.
[00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:57.294]  It was launched against the Capitol because they'd originally planned to flight 93 into there until generals refused orders and ordered the plane shot down.
[00:18:57.354 --> 00:19:01.716]  Thank God they wanted total congressional decapitation, the image of the smoking Capitol.
[00:19:01.996 --> 00:19:09.200]  So at a limited level to bully Congress, they launched the anthrax attack, had FBI running around with machine guns, shut down five of the six office buildings.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.760]  You're right, Mike.
[00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:14.412]  Yeah, and it's a very, very dangerous time.
[00:19:15.012 --> 00:19:28.516]  The only thing I can think right now is that with this 84% number, that has to be a deterrent to anybody who's planning this kind of a deceptive operation, because they're going to look at that number and say, you know, we didn't succeed with the last one.
[00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:29.656]  They weren't fooled.
[00:19:29.996 --> 00:19:32.897]  You know, if we try another one, it's only going to get worse.
[00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:34.917]  So, it's really a question.
[00:19:35.197 --> 00:19:41.721]  Unfortunately, the future of our nation is in the hands of whichever leader is the least mentally stable, and that's a very worrisome situation.
[00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:43.642]  You're absolutely right.
[00:19:43.842 --> 00:19:49.045]  Michael Rivero, thank you for joining us, and we'll see you, what, coming up November 7th, I believe?
[00:19:49.705 --> 00:19:50.225]  You got it.
[00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:51.766]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:52.426]  God bless.
[00:19:52.907 --> 00:19:54.888]  Alright, we'll be right back, my friends.
[00:19:55.048 --> 00:19:58.029]  I want to thank him again for joining us from Hawaii with that update.
[00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.870]  Stay with us.
[00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:07.756]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?

[00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:08.001]  The real money folks.
[00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:14.326]  Let's review a few things from the past November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:16.932 --> 00:21:18.794]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:19.334 --> 00:21:21.696]  A 5% increase!
[00:21:22.236 --> 00:21:27.821]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:31.323]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:32.084 --> 00:21:34.426]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[00:21:34.446 --> 00:21:37.708]  A 16% increase in real money!
[00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:41.351]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:23:02.868 --> 00:23:06.091]  You know, I really wish I could just power my place with solar.
[00:23:07.675 --> 00:23:13.877]  That's what I was saying to myself over and over again for years until I found out about Ken Solar.
[00:23:14.197 --> 00:23:20.778]  Ken has been working with solar power for over a decade and has designed systems for people all over the world.
[00:23:21.158 --> 00:23:30.220]  He's put together customized alternative energy packages for everything from powering the local supermarket all the way down to portable solar power generators.

[00:23:58.571 --> 00:24:00.212]  That's Ken Solar.
[00:24:10.527 --> 00:24:25.792]  To my knowledge, three separate times, Bill Maher has attacked Charlie Sheen for Charlie's bold stance on 9-11, going public and exposing the official story to be a fraud.
[00:24:27.012 --> 00:24:32.634]  Bill Maher poses as this trendy liberal, and he says some things that are true, some things that aren't.
[00:24:33.034 --> 00:24:35.014]  But at the end of the day, he's an establishment hack.
[00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:40.016]  We're going to play that clip coming up in the next hour, and it ties into this whole discussion.
[00:24:41.228 --> 00:24:47.113]  84% of Americans don't buy the official story and believe they're being lied to in a scientific poll.
[00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:53.137]  And so Bill Maher, you can sit over there with your 16% and it'll soon be 10% and it'll soon be 8%.
[00:24:54.859 --> 00:25:06.207]  8% of Americans on average in major scientific polls believe, and it's been frozen at that for two years, we haven't gained any... We raced up to 92% on the 40th anniversary.
[00:25:06.808 --> 00:25:09.510]  Now we're coming up on the 43rd anniversary of Kennedy being killed.
[00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:11.599]  And you can't budge that 8%.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:24.402]  8% of this country believes a lone assassin got off three shots from a junkie bolt-action rifle at about a hundred yards away, threw a tree, obstructing his entire view.
[00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:31.864]  8% believe that you can sprout wings and fly to Jupiter in five minutes, in less time than it takes to boil hot water.
[00:25:33.584 --> 00:25:34.804]  8% believe the sun doesn't rise.
[00:25:35.364 --> 00:25:37.585]  8% believe that George Bush is a conservative.
[00:25:38.812 --> 00:25:42.135]  8% will believe anything they're told anytime because they're gutless cowards.
[00:25:42.455 --> 00:25:44.177]  They decide to believe whatever they're told.
[00:25:44.197 --> 00:25:44.717]  They're scum.
[00:25:45.838 --> 00:25:48.360]  And hey, forget that we were your brethren.
[00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:51.103]  May your chains sit lightly upon you.
[00:25:51.523 --> 00:25:53.345]  Just go into the quiet night.
[00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:57.649]  Go get in the dick so the New World Order can blow your brains out the backside of your head.
[00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:59.491]  And forget that we were your countrymen.
[00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:01.392]  I scorn you.
[00:26:01.492 --> 00:26:03.014]  Just get out of my face.
[00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:04.055]  Get out of my way!
[00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:08.370]  Get out of the road!
[00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.451]  Get behind us!
[00:26:09.571 --> 00:26:12.654]  We're on our path to liberty and freedom and defeating the New World Order.
[00:26:12.674 --> 00:26:18.020]  You go suck your thumb and tell us we can't fight corruption or tell us there is no corruption somewhere else.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.102]  Get out of my way!
[00:26:19.122 --> 00:26:25.128]  Now, let's get into this incredible news.
[00:26:25.168 --> 00:26:27.351]  Michael Rivera made a point, though, I wanted to elaborate on.
[00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:36.916]  And that is, the landslide against incumbents, and that means Democrats and Republicans, is so huge in all the polling data we've got.
[00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:38.637]  You know, I don't just trust one poll.
[00:26:38.657 --> 00:26:40.098]  I look at whole indexes of polls.
[00:26:40.418 --> 00:26:44.240]  I mesh that with what I'm getting in public opinion on my talk show and other interviews I do.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:53.785]  The public opinion is so against this criminal government and all its pimps and pomps and servants and minions and viceroys and duchies and the rest of them.
[00:26:56.861 --> 00:27:07.808]  That even if they try to steal the election, what do you do when the anti-New World Order, or pro-freedom, or just anti-incumbent candidate is winning by twenty-something points?
[00:27:08.108 --> 00:27:11.910]  How do you steal that when the exit polls are showing somebody's winning by twenty points?
[00:27:14.211 --> 00:27:22.116]  Kerry was winning in Ohio by about seven points, and it really blew up in their face when the Republicans stole it, and then everybody knew they stole it.
[00:27:22.788 --> 00:27:23.489]  What do you do when it's 20%?
[00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.471]  And again, we're not saying Kerry's good.
[00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:27.772]  He also then took a dive.
[00:27:28.092 --> 00:27:28.973]  It was all staged.
[00:27:29.133 --> 00:27:35.178]  If you're going to stage the electronic voting machine fraud at the local level, you've got to have the national candidate take a dive and not challenge it.
[00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:41.804]  And again, in 70% of this country, roughly, you don't have these CIA-controlled machines.
[00:27:44.426 --> 00:27:45.887]  And so they've got a big problem.
[00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:51.332]  They've got a huge problem on their hands and
[00:27:52.699 --> 00:27:53.800]  Rivero's right.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:02.064]  I think if Bush sees certain doom and certain loss here in the next two weeks, folks, we're only 20 days, what, 22 days away from election.
[00:28:02.444 --> 00:28:03.925]  They may hit the panic button.
[00:28:05.186 --> 00:28:08.087]  We're in the prime zone and they don't care how obvious it is.
[00:28:08.387 --> 00:28:09.608]  Hubris is their name.
[00:28:10.449 --> 00:28:14.371]  Usually an October surprise comes in late September, early October.
[00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:17.773]  Man, they could, you know, I said we'll see the terror attack by late October.
[00:28:18.013 --> 00:28:20.034]  They could be the day before election.
[00:28:20.654 --> 00:28:22.275]  It could be on election day.
[00:28:23.248 --> 00:28:24.388]  These guys don't care!
[00:28:24.408 --> 00:28:26.949]  It could be on Election Day!
[00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.030]  And I've always said it's a Catch-22.
[00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:46.654]  Either we just ignore the criminals running our government, let them keep staging terror attacks and enslave us, or we expose the fact they're behind the terror, which ensures they'll carry out terror attacks, but then at least we're all awake to who's behind it and then they lose in the end.
[00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:53.267]  So you can either let them carry out terror attacks, or you can fight them, and they're still going to carry out terror attacks, but then we have a better chance of winning.
[00:28:53.787 --> 00:28:55.788]  And we've now forced them into that position.
[00:28:56.688 --> 00:29:01.650]  We're fighting them on our terms, on level playing ground, not where they've got the high ground.
[00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.871]  We're forcing them to act like tyrants.
[00:29:05.171 --> 00:29:07.312]  We're forcing them to be despots.
[00:29:07.552 --> 00:29:10.213]  We're forcing them to be despotic and tyrannical.
[00:29:10.876 --> 00:29:13.958]  And they're going to do it more and more and more.
[00:29:14.138 --> 00:29:17.720]  And they're going to show their face more and more and more.
[00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:35.070]  And things may get a lot worse before they get better, but we've just got to be rock hard, got to have steel in our eyes, got to have iron eyes, folks, and just eye of the tiger, fixed on the enemy, never stopping, never surrendering.
[00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.132]  We shall prevail with God's help, with His standard.
[00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:42.258]  When we get back, I'll go through the poll.
[00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:43.700]  This is such incredible news.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.443]  All the details, the facets, the analysis.
[00:29:47.184 --> 00:29:47.865]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.648 --> 00:29:51.549]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.652]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.573 --> 00:29:57.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:04.471]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:30:04.711 --> 00:30:05.572]  Look no further!
[00:30:05.872 --> 00:30:08.435]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:17.022]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:30:17.022 --> 00:30:17.583]  I think so.
[00:30:34.821 --> 00:30:35.321]  I think so.
[00:31:02.404 --> 00:31:13.734]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:21.982]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:22.262 --> 00:31:33.006]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:33.246 --> 00:31:38.748]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:38.988 --> 00:31:45.910]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system, so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.812]  The Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[00:31:47.872 --> 00:31:48.733]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.753 --> 00:31:50.254]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:50.274 --> 00:31:50.955]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:04.630]  I don't think so.
[00:33:16.137 --> 00:33:22.360]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:25.862]  Say that joker to the beat.
[00:33:28.123 --> 00:33:29.823]  There's too much confusion.
[00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:36.331]  I can't get no relief.
[00:33:36.671 --> 00:33:39.813]  Mr. Slander, drink my wine.
[00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:42.795]  Come and dig my earth.
[00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:48.338]  None will level on the mine.
[00:33:49.379 --> 00:33:51.320]  Nobody other this world.
[00:33:55.072 --> 00:33:56.013]  I love you out there.
[00:33:56.293 --> 00:33:57.914]  Every man, woman, and child.
[00:33:58.154 --> 00:34:03.778]  Old, young, black, white, Hispanic, Russian, Chinese, American, Texan.
[00:34:04.618 --> 00:34:05.079]  I love you.
[00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:09.341]  It's good to be here together in this fight against tyranny.
[00:34:09.461 --> 00:34:13.344]  The new world order is coming in, but it's coming in dead on arrival.
[00:34:14.116 --> 00:34:15.757]  They've already got their world government.
[00:34:15.777 --> 00:34:17.339]  They're trying to put the finishing touches on it.
[00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:19.561]  They're trying to raise the curtain in front of us.
[00:34:19.601 --> 00:34:23.985]  They're trying to arrogantly tell us there's no way out, but we're going to defeat them with God's help.
[00:34:24.425 --> 00:34:25.766]  They may have bought off the churches.
[00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:33.913]  The churches may be telling the Christians to lay down and go along with this new world order, but people are waking up inside the Christian church, just like the Democrats are waking up.
[00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:41.720]  Kevin and Aaron and some other folks here in the crew went down to the World Can't Wait big demonstration here in Austin last week.
[00:34:42.603 --> 00:34:48.827]  And one of the little socialist speakers got up and said, we need to get somebody real in to save the country like Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:50.648]  And everyone booed!
[00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:54.731]  Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, 9-11 truthers.
[00:34:55.391 --> 00:34:58.033]  Booed and booed and booed.
[00:34:59.654 --> 00:35:05.298]  I was on a syndicated show out of Rhode Island that's on at five stations in New England, Friday.
[00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:15.314]  And I didn't get a chance to hear it, but Kevin and Rob were in here working late night Friday, and so they decided to just tune in to the show.
[00:35:15.334 --> 00:35:18.415]  It was a taped interview I'd done during the day.
[00:35:19.175 --> 00:35:29.257]  And so they tuned into it, and they played the little 15-minute interview I did, and then opened the phones up, and Kevin and Rob for two hours up here,
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.161]  Hope they weren't on the clock though.
[00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:44.367]  Listened to caller after caller and Kevin said something like 30 callers called in in the next two hours and one of them disagreed and said that I was a traitor.
[00:35:44.607 --> 00:35:45.087]  One lady.
[00:35:46.228 --> 00:35:48.349]  And again, that's indicative of what I get everywhere.
[00:35:49.889 --> 00:35:52.751]  And the hosts were just saying, well we don't know if this is true.
[00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:53.651]  Here's his views.
[00:35:53.711 --> 00:35:54.452]  What do you think?
[00:35:56.413 --> 00:35:59.134]  30 callers plus over several hours.
[00:36:01.056 --> 00:36:10.700]  And one lady called in, and then near the end of the second hour, they go back to the phones, and it's her again, and she says, You're screening the calls!
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.562]  Everyone is agreeing with that crazy man!
[00:36:15.602 --> 00:36:17.502]  And they said, Ma'am, did we screen your call?
[00:36:17.522 --> 00:36:21.024]  We're just... It's a syndicated music show.
[00:36:21.044 --> 00:36:22.024]  It's rock and roll.
[00:36:22.728 --> 00:36:24.470]  And so, on those shows, they don't screen them.
[00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.371]  They just go to the calls.
[00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:26.992]  They go, hello, what's your name?
[00:36:27.453 --> 00:36:28.013]  What's your point?
[00:36:28.033 --> 00:36:29.935]  And they said, man, we didn't screen you.
[00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:31.557]  And she's like, well, you're screening others.
[00:36:31.577 --> 00:36:33.599]  And they said, well, it's you calling back.
[00:36:33.979 --> 00:36:34.960]  We didn't screen you.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.382]  See, they can't believe it.
[00:36:36.442 --> 00:36:37.223]  I've been on shows.
[00:36:37.263 --> 00:36:41.427]  I'll never forget this one about two years ago in San Diego on Kogo for like an hour.
[00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.074]  He's attacking me.
[00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:43.774]  I'm a traitor.
[00:36:44.094 --> 00:36:44.695]  I'm crazy.
[00:36:44.715 --> 00:36:46.115]  9-11 is not an inside job.
[00:36:46.396 --> 00:36:47.096]  I'm a liberal.
[00:36:47.176 --> 00:36:47.837]  I'm a commie.
[00:36:47.857 --> 00:36:50.198]  You know, just on and on with these names.
[00:36:50.899 --> 00:36:52.600]  And he probably took 20 calls.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.221]  And one or two of them disagreed with me.
[00:36:55.662 --> 00:37:02.226]  And by the end of it, he had his call screener trying to find people who disagreed and they couldn't.
[00:37:02.626 --> 00:37:04.327]  And he panicked and just hung up on me.
[00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:05.648]  And I went and tuned in on the Internet.
[00:37:06.429 --> 00:37:12.993]  And, uh, listened, and he kept getting more calls in the next hour after he'd gotten rid of me, after he demonized me and didn't try to take calls.
[00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:18.036]  He said, that's it, we're getting off this topic, it's a full moon, you're all nuts!
[00:37:20.945 --> 00:37:28.071]  The only illusion the New World Order's got left is that we are all a minority, that we're kooks.
[00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:30.733]  We are the majority, but we don't know that yet.
[00:37:30.933 --> 00:37:36.357]  I know that, a lot of you know that, but the general public quietly knows the truth in their gut and their spirit.
[00:37:36.697 --> 00:37:38.879]  They quietly know it in their intellect and their mind.
[00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:41.281]  They quietly have seen enough pieces of the puzzle.
[00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:46.725]  They're seeing a lot of other indicators, how they get lied to every day, how they're being treated like scum by police.
[00:37:47.325 --> 00:37:49.627]  More and more, people are learning.
[00:37:49.687 --> 00:37:52.728]  More and more, people are finding out that the dollar has been devalued.
[00:37:52.928 --> 00:37:54.950]  That the economy isn't as good as they say it is.
[00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.552]  More and more, people are finding out they're getting rid of the borders.
[00:37:58.792 --> 00:38:03.735]  The North American Union, everything we warned them about 10 years ago, 20 years ago, patriots 50 years ago.
[00:38:04.295 --> 00:38:11.239]  When we had 1937 New York Times cover pages about the 10 regions, which they now have, and the North American Union,
[00:38:14.676 --> 00:38:16.821]  All of this is being revealed now.
[00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:19.567]  We're being given a choice as a country.
[00:38:19.648 --> 00:38:23.456]  Are we going to go along with this quietly into the night or are we going to say no?
[00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.552]  So the only illusion they've got left is that we're the minority.
[00:38:28.592 --> 00:38:28.852]  No, no.
[00:38:29.192 --> 00:38:31.153]  We are the super majority.
[00:38:31.733 --> 00:38:41.178]  But we are a tribal, social creature in our mannerisms, very closely aligned to the canine familiaris, the household dog.
[00:38:41.198 --> 00:38:50.582]  That's why we domesticated them and love them because they're so similar to us in mannerisms, in the pack, in the troop, which you'd call a human group, tribal group, a troop.
[00:38:51.653 --> 00:39:00.000]  The pack merges with the troop, and so, like little social animals, we watch the news, and they tell us what the majority view is.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:13.411]  We watch the news, and they tell us that only kooks believe the government killed Kennedy, and only kooks believe 9-11 is an inside job, and only kooks are against the North American Union, and only traitors are against the Iraq War.
[00:39:15.233 --> 00:39:17.655]  But then the polls show 97% against toll roads.
[00:39:20.759 --> 00:39:21.719]  90% against open borders.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.222]  72% against the Iraq War, including the troops.
[00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:28.444]  And so they try to hide those polls.
[00:39:28.504 --> 00:39:34.809]  Every once in a while they get a poll they like now, and by one of the fraudulent news agencies like Fox or somebody, that's trumpeted everywhere.
[00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:39.192]  But I see the polls going to the big poll organizations that you never hear about.
[00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:41.945]  And you won't hear about this poll.
[00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:50.792]  Now I was surprised when they decided to go with 36% in a Scripps Howard Ohio University poll that actually from the info I have actually downplayed it.
[00:39:50.812 --> 00:39:55.095]  That 36% believe inside job, 68% believe government cover-up.
[00:39:55.335 --> 00:39:56.476]  The numbers are higher than that.
[00:39:57.536 --> 00:40:01.699]  From just all the info I have and how polls work and poll psychology and poll science.
[00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:09.185]  Well here is an extremely scientific poll that mirrors all the unscientific polls.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:16.305]  That I believe are more scientific than... CNN would let you vote once in the poll.
[00:40:17.286 --> 00:40:18.367]  I went and read the poll rules.
[00:40:18.407 --> 00:40:20.429]  You thought you could vote more than once, but it didn't count.
[00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:29.576]  You could vote once off of each terminal, off of each IP address, and that is the IP address that your vote, you know, what server, what internet connection you were using.
[00:40:29.977 --> 00:40:31.778]  Remember the Charlie Sheen poll? 84%
[00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:36.923]  Believing that the official story was a fraud.
[00:40:36.983 --> 00:40:38.784]  Believing that there was a cover-up.
[00:40:39.344 --> 00:40:44.347]  CNN's biggest response ever in a poll of 44,000 respondents.
[00:40:45.528 --> 00:40:44.347]  84%.
[00:40:45.828 --> 00:40:48.370]  Another CNN poll, 9,000 respondents.
[00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.731]  Well, it was actually 12,000 respondents.
[00:40:51.291 --> 00:40:53.112]  But, what was it?
[00:40:53.132 --> 00:40:53.533]  9,000 something.
[00:40:53.953 --> 00:40:55.114]  Believing that there was a cover-up.
[00:40:55.154 --> 00:40:56.234]  That was in 2004 on Anderson Cooper.
[00:40:58.863 --> 00:41:05.567]  All the other polls, an MSN poll two weeks ago that was scientific, 61% believing there's a cover-up.
[00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:07.368]  So we got these high numbers.
[00:41:07.428 --> 00:41:12.391]  Well now, I told everybody, once you go above the high 60s, it snowballs.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:13.681]  Okay?
[00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:21.207]  Then, the people that always had a question think it's safe now to tell the poller what they really think.
[00:41:21.828 --> 00:41:24.030]  Eighty-four percent!
[00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:28.894]  I mean, I need sirens, I need the sound of clapping, I need... In fact, you told me you have applause.
[00:41:29.275 --> 00:41:30.075]  Dig that applause up.
[00:41:30.115 --> 00:41:39.544]  I mean, we need the sound of hip-hip, hooray, we need the sound of screaming and rejoicing, because this is incredible news, my friends.
[00:41:41.881 --> 00:41:55.469]  Scientific Poll 84% Project Official 9-11 Story Only 16% Now Believe Official Fable According to New York Times CBS News Poll Truth Movement Has the Huge Majority of Opinion How Will the Bush Cabal React?
[00:41:56.337 --> 00:41:57.538]  By Steve Watson.
[00:41:58.078 --> 00:42:08.323]  A monumental new scientific opinion poll has emerged which declares that only 16% of people in America now believe the official government explanation of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
[00:42:08.703 --> 00:42:20.769]  According to the new New York Times-CBS News poll from Angus and Reed, very respected, only 16% of Americans think the government is telling the truth about 9-11 and the intelligence prior to the attacks.
[00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:25.992]  Here is, drumroll please... I'll do it myself there, very high-tech.
[00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:27.462]  Sound effects.
[00:42:28.822 --> 00:42:32.145]  Do you think members of the Bush Administration are telling the truth?
[00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:36.868]  Are mostly telling the truth, but hiding something, or are they mostly lying?
[00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:39.209]  Telling the truth, 16%.
[00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:40.150]  Hiding something, 53%.
[00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:41.971]  Mostly lying, 28%.
[00:42:47.199 --> 00:42:47.779]  Not sure at 3%.
[00:42:47.839 --> 00:42:52.881]  The 84% figure mirrors other recent polls on the same issue.
[00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:55.782]  A Canadian poll put the findings at 85%.
[00:42:55.822 --> 00:42:56.703]  A CNN poll had the figure at 89.
[00:42:57.123 --> 00:42:57.363]  Another at 80.
[00:42:57.403 --> 00:42:58.143]  And it goes on and on.
[00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:09.080]  on the stance of Charlie Sheen when he went public with his opinions of 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:22.531]  A recent CNN poll found the percentage of Americans who blame the Bush administration for September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington rose from almost a third to almost half after the last four years.
[00:43:23.071 --> 00:43:33.600]  This latest poll shows the figure has again risen exponentially and now stands at well over three-quarters of the population believing they're being totally lied to or partially lied to.
[00:43:41.132 --> 00:43:41.972]  I like that.
[00:43:43.232 --> 00:43:44.313]  Go to that clip site.
[00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:47.253]  I think they just took a little clap from the State of the Union.
[00:43:47.273 --> 00:43:51.114]  I remember one day we quickly did that and just had the same two-second clap over and over again.
[00:43:51.394 --> 00:43:52.014]  Good job!
[00:43:53.195 --> 00:43:54.315]  We found this great clip site.
[00:43:54.355 --> 00:43:56.235]  If Rob was here, I'd send it to the network.
[00:43:56.775 --> 00:44:00.956]  But I'm usually not into sound effects, so I don't blame him for not having them.
[00:44:02.197 --> 00:44:04.237]  Thank you, God, for opening people's eyes.
[00:44:04.297 --> 00:44:08.978]  Thank you, God, for getting leaders out there to stand up and take action.
[00:44:10.598 --> 00:44:30.857]  Like Michael Rivero, like Jack Blood, like Webster Tarpley, or Jim Fetzer, or Professor Stephen Jones, or Kevin Barrett, or folks like Dave von Kleist, the Genesis Network, all the other networks that are out there telling the truth when they're not attacking others.
[00:44:31.178 --> 00:44:32.339]  It's good to stay on target, guys.
[00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:34.561]  You can actually win the battle instead of going to FEMA camps.
[00:44:35.763 --> 00:44:57.788]  And just to, there's so many, I can't name them all, I mentioned all these change folks, that I mentioned the guests we had in the studio, Ken Jenkins, David Ray Griffin, the Guerrilla News Network, all the websites, 9-11 Truth, 9-11 Blogger, just there's millions of you, and thousands of sites, and hundreds of groups.
[00:44:58.795 --> 00:45:01.776]  Just everybody out there for what you've done.
[00:45:02.357 --> 00:45:03.077]  Keep it up!
[00:45:03.377 --> 00:45:06.719]  All of you, the listeners of this broadcast, that have taken Terror Storm.
[00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:13.262]  By the way, I found if you type Terror Storm as one word into Google, I found a whole bunch of other versions of it I didn't even know about.
[00:45:13.602 --> 00:45:17.564]  I kept entering it into the Google search engine as Terror Separation Storm.
[00:45:19.378 --> 00:45:26.830]  And I did some counting, so now it's over 5 million that have seen it, even with them deleting the numbers.
[00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.273]  We've caught them freezing stats, deleting stats.
[00:45:29.654 --> 00:45:32.638]  The loose change guys are now doing it to them, trying to keep us out of the top 100.
[00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:33.680]  They're panicking!
[00:45:34.284 --> 00:45:49.413]  Well, you just go out there again, email your whole list, go on to all the message boards, go on to the MySpace accounts, call into talk radio shows, Patriot shows, mainstream shows, and tell them, listen, Terror Storm is the newest, most powerful film exposing government-sponsored terror.
[00:45:49.814 --> 00:45:53.836]  It's professionally produced, and it's free at Google Video.
[00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:56.518]  One word, Terror Storm.
[00:45:58.706 --> 00:46:01.107]  I mean, I'm on a major campaign, folks.
[00:46:01.848 --> 00:46:05.330]  I did five interviews this weekend, three on Friday.
[00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:06.731]  I'm going nuts.
[00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:07.832]  I'm not stopping.
[00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.214]  I'm doing more today, more tomorrow.
[00:46:11.814 --> 00:46:15.676]  I mean, I am fired up because I see that we're near the end of this race.
[00:46:17.317 --> 00:46:19.419]  We're close to the end of this major battle.
[00:46:19.479 --> 00:46:20.479]  The war goes on.
[00:46:20.579 --> 00:46:22.640]  Evil's going to be with us for a long time.
[00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:25.062]  And we've got to fight it.
[00:46:25.979 --> 00:46:28.960]  Till God steps in against that old dragon, that old serpent.
[00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.041]  So I'm excited here.
[00:46:33.382 --> 00:46:39.524]  It took 35 plus years for the majority of Americans to wake up to the fact that the assassination of JFK was a government operation.
[00:46:40.177 --> 00:46:47.261]  It has only taken five years for more Americans to wake up to the fact that 9-11 was an inside job on behalf of the neoconservative crime syndicate within the U.S.
[00:46:47.661 --> 00:46:55.425]  And no amount of fake Al-Qaeda or fat bin Laden videos or soundless videos that we then find out are part of made-for-TV movies.
[00:46:57.546 --> 00:46:58.766]  We just caught you on that!
[00:46:58.807 --> 00:47:01.428]  That should bring the entire pack of criminals down right there!
[00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:07.491]  No amount of it is going to put your story back together again.
[00:47:08.217 --> 00:47:15.380]  References to past polls that show in the last five years there has been an explosion in numbers of those who did not buy the official line.
[00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:20.603]  In 2004, a Zogby poll showed that just over half of New Yorkers believed there was a cover-up.
[00:47:21.063 --> 00:47:27.146]  In May of this year, another Zogby poll indicated that around half of all Americans did not buy the official story.
[00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:36.170]  The latest poll also shows a massive awakening has occurred recently, given that previous statements indicated that around 34% still believe the official story and around 30% were
[00:47:37.992 --> 00:47:39.457]  Oblivious all together.
[00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:44.853]  By the way, I want your emails to be sent to
[00:47:46.303 --> 00:47:55.128]  Paul Watson, go to PrisonPlanet.com and e-mail, this is e-mail webmaster, I want you to send your e-mails to Aaron at Infowars.com, Kevin at Infowars.com.
[00:47:55.628 --> 00:48:04.974]  Specifically, I want to hear your testaments to who you think has fought the hardest in the 9-11 Truth Movement, who you think has gotten the word out the best, who you want to commend.
[00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:08.736]  And I just want to post hundreds of these e-mails in the next few days on the sites.
[00:48:09.972 --> 00:48:15.036]  We could put up some poll, but I don't want to have a poll of who the best is, or who's done the best job.
[00:48:15.076 --> 00:48:15.697]  That doesn't matter.
[00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:26.026]  I just want to hear testaments to these warriors, these men and women, of every race, color, and creed, and every stripe, who have, and again, I'm not declaring victory here, I'm just telling you,
[00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:28.678]  Man, we have been whooping up on the enemy.
[00:48:28.698 --> 00:48:30.840]  We've been winning some major battles.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.882]  We've been taking ground from these people.
[00:48:32.922 --> 00:48:33.963]  We've been taking hills.
[00:48:34.603 --> 00:48:38.827]  We have really been busting our hind ends and taking a lot of adversity.
[00:48:38.847 --> 00:48:48.777]  And you don't know how tough it was day one to go on there and say it was an inside job and to know it was coming two months before and to get past my fear personally and go in through and beyond.
[00:48:49.577 --> 00:48:52.220]  I'm telling you, we first have to realize we can win.
[00:48:54.329 --> 00:48:55.549]  And I know we can.
[00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:59.830]  I'm not going to listen to these churches telling us to lay down on government payroll.
[00:49:02.011 --> 00:49:03.091]  Biggest thing we face.
[00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:05.791]  It continues.
[00:49:06.232 --> 00:49:10.372]  In May of this year, another Zobby Poll indicated that around half of all Americans did not buy the official story.
[00:49:10.753 --> 00:49:11.253]  It goes on.
[00:49:11.273 --> 00:49:22.275]  The latest poll shows a massive awakening has occurred recently, giving that previous estimate indicated that around 34% still believe the official story and around 30% were oblivious altogether.
[00:49:23.121 --> 00:49:34.564]  Alex Jones declared that the truth movement has a cause to celebrate this evening as it is now beyond any doubt that the vast majority of Americans know that the official story of 19 Saudis with box cutters is ludicrous.
[00:49:35.164 --> 00:49:36.524]  It's impossible and it's a lie.
[00:49:37.204 --> 00:49:43.526]  The diligence of those who have worked to educate the world on 9-11 truth from day one cannot be underestimated.
[00:49:43.586 --> 00:49:48.547]  We are now seeing the fruits of this hard and at times extremely trying labor hit home.
[00:49:48.827 --> 00:49:51.228]  And make no mistake, some of us are going to lose our lives for this.
[00:49:52.108 --> 00:49:54.269]  They'll be ripped apart by COINTELPRO enemies.
[00:49:54.529 --> 00:49:56.971]  But they can tear individuals apart.
[00:49:57.231 --> 00:49:58.351]  They can demonize us.
[00:49:58.671 --> 00:49:59.772]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:49:59.812 --> 00:50:01.473]  But they cannot kill the truth.
[00:50:01.853 --> 00:50:02.994]  It is bulletproof.
[00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:04.675]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[00:50:04.875 --> 00:50:06.155]  The world is round.
[00:50:06.656 --> 00:50:07.956]  The war is a fraud.
[00:50:07.976 --> 00:50:10.078]  9-11 is an inside job.
[00:50:10.458 --> 00:50:12.859]  Bush is a demon and a puppet of the Illuminati.
[00:50:13.079 --> 00:50:13.880]  And we're winning!
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.221]  All of those are facts.
[00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:23.604]  We would add, though, that although this is a major victory for the truth movement, it does not mean that the hard work can stop.
[00:50:25.946 --> 00:50:40.916]  The next step is to use the majority opinion as leverage towards officially challenging that record of what happened on 9-11, forcing the mainstream media into addressing the issue, not as a quirky news item, but as a serious redefining of the state of the nation and the world today.
[00:50:41.957 --> 00:50:46.080]  And the number one focus right now, right now,
[00:50:46.815 --> 00:50:47.717]  Cold action!
[00:50:47.957 --> 00:50:49.821]  Cold arms in the Infowar!
[00:50:50.542 --> 00:50:53.527]  The number one thing you can do right now.
[00:50:53.928 --> 00:50:55.311]  I'll tell you when we get back from break.
[00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:57.174]  Get ready.
[00:50:57.595 --> 00:50:58.677]  Get your mind focused.
[00:51:03.934 --> 00:51:04.374]  It's here!
[00:51:04.595 --> 00:51:09.378]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.738 --> 00:51:17.424]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.084 --> 00:51:25.150]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:32.395]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:32.904 --> 00:51:36.986]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.246 --> 00:51:40.747]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.227 --> 00:51:43.148]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.488 --> 00:51:47.410]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.019 --> 00:52:04.583]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:04.623 --> 00:52:05.143]  are located?

[00:53:56.605 --> 00:53:59.228]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:03.012 --> 00:54:09.056]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.656 --> 00:54:12.638]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.099 --> 00:54:19.462]  Alright, Rush Limbaugh attacked me as the evil leader of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:54:21.763 --> 00:54:23.364]  We'll be playing that later in the next hour.
[00:54:24.024 --> 00:54:26.726]  We've discovered the mystery of the weird George Bush call I got.
[00:54:27.739 --> 00:54:32.800]  I also have a clip of a lady from my Sunday show who told me I was anti-semitic for using the word neocon.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:33.660]  We'll be playing that.
[00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:38.322]  We'll also get into a bunch of other news.
[00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:41.382]  We'll play this Bill Maher clip attacking Charlie Sheen and 9-11 Truth.
[00:54:42.262 --> 00:54:44.603]  He's done this three times now that I know of.
[00:54:44.943 --> 00:54:46.343]  This is one of the latest a few weeks ago.
[00:54:48.144 --> 00:54:50.764]  But let me tell you what we need to do here.
[00:54:50.924 --> 00:54:53.045]  The mainstream media is going to try to ignore
[00:54:54.750 --> 00:55:03.672]  The fact that 84% believe they're being lied to about 9-11, and even the newspapers are trying, the few articles I saw mainstream are trying to spin it.
[00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:08.973]  Right now I'm going, well that's just because they learned that they lied about intelligence and how big the threat was.
[00:55:09.293 --> 00:55:10.773]  That's what they think there's a lie about.
[00:55:11.113 --> 00:55:12.674]  No, it's do you think you're being lied to?
[00:55:13.074 --> 00:55:19.115]  And it fits in with the other polls, showing the majority believe there's a cover-up and a majority of that majority believing it's an inside job.
[00:55:20.046 --> 00:55:22.067]  So go get the article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:22.627 --> 00:55:29.169]  Op-Ed News wrote another good article today that we need to get posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and all the sites.
[00:55:29.189 --> 00:55:30.789]  I think it's probably already up there.
[00:55:31.229 --> 00:55:32.970]  That needs to be gotten out to everybody.
[00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:43.353]  And Steve Watson's writing another article today, a call to arms in the information war to let everybody know, hey, the majority believe we're being lied to.
[00:55:44.593 --> 00:55:48.074]  Now here's the truth, inside job, here's the motive.
[00:55:50.951 --> 00:56:03.321]  And again, we need to add to this article we're writing the fact that we go on these talk radio shows and the host of Texas, whether it's in Florida or California or Rhode Island or Boston or Texas.
[00:56:04.202 --> 00:56:10.027]  I mean, take KLBJ, man, that's Rush Limbaugh, Neil Borch, Drudge.
[00:56:10.768 --> 00:56:12.309]  This is mainstream big radio.
[00:56:13.104 --> 00:56:14.906]  And I get one caller in two hours.
[00:56:14.966 --> 00:56:16.607]  They go to the head of the line and they disagree with me.
[00:56:16.747 --> 00:56:21.611]  One call out of probably, I don't know, I probably only took 15 calls because I had so much news yesterday.
[00:56:22.292 --> 00:56:27.736]  But I could have taken 30, 40 as I've done on some shows and sometimes no one disagrees.
[00:56:27.796 --> 00:56:30.098]  And I'm like 1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:31.019]  Call if you disagree.
[00:56:31.299 --> 00:56:32.160]  You go to the head of the line.
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.581]  I'm told we do have someone who kind of disagrees.
[00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:37.904]  They say, we'll go to them first and we'll start the next hour here in just a moment.
[00:56:40.006 --> 00:56:41.907]  But before we do that, please go to
[00:56:43.203 --> 00:56:44.364]  Google Video.
[00:56:45.185 --> 00:56:47.507]  Get Terror Storm for free.
[00:56:50.851 --> 00:56:53.694]  Type it in as one word and you get even more versions of it.
[00:56:53.714 --> 00:56:56.436]  Look for ones that say deluxe or high quality because they really look good.
[00:56:56.737 --> 00:56:58.799]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.340]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:57:01.986 --> 00:57:06.067]  We do need a little bit of capital or we won't be here, but it doesn't seem to matter.
[00:57:06.087 --> 00:57:10.048]  I'm so busy firing my Info Cannon at the enemy, I don't even worry I'm running out of ammo.
[00:57:10.248 --> 00:57:13.349]  I'm just jamming the cartridges in, firing, blasting them.
[00:57:14.009 --> 00:57:24.572]  I'm just foaming at the mouth, literally, because, I mean, you get in a combat mode in this psychological warfare op we're in, using the truth, and their huge capital ships of lies are totally vulnerable.
[00:57:25.532 --> 00:57:26.293]  You understand?
[00:57:26.613 --> 00:57:28.753]  We slice through them like a hot knife through butter.
[00:57:29.133 --> 00:57:30.314]  The enemy's pathetic!
[00:57:30.494 --> 00:57:31.514]  Wring their necks!
[00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.630]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:39.593]  I mean, we haven't admitted that it's fake video of Mohammed Adda that they released three weeks ago.
[00:57:40.014 --> 00:57:40.594]  Just admitted.
[00:57:41.534 --> 00:57:42.475]  See, that's out there now.
[00:57:43.055 --> 00:57:44.216]  Just this fake, fakeness.
[00:57:44.516 --> 00:57:45.156]  It's all fake.
[00:57:46.477 --> 00:57:47.157]  Ring their necks.
[00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:53.520]  So, go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a 15 cent a day membership, and get download quality video of TerrorStorm.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:54.941]  So good it looks like TV.
[00:57:56.142 --> 00:57:56.982]  And there's something more.
[00:57:57.482 --> 00:57:58.423]  Burn it to disk.
[00:57:59.346 --> 00:58:00.367]  Burn it to disk.
[00:58:00.467 --> 00:58:02.949]  Burn it to disk every day before you go to bed.
[00:58:02.969 --> 00:58:03.590]  It takes a few minutes.
[00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:04.771]  Burn one copy.
[00:58:04.811 --> 00:58:06.793]  Give one copy out in a year.
[00:58:07.133 --> 00:58:08.774]  That'll go by in the winkling of an eye.
[00:58:08.834 --> 00:58:09.735]  A twinkling of an eye.
[00:58:10.456 --> 00:58:11.477]  You are winkling.
[00:58:11.557 --> 00:58:12.457]  I'm making up words here.
[00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:15.200]  You'll have 365 copies out.
[00:58:16.381 --> 00:58:18.002]  Or maybe make five copies a day.
[00:58:18.262 --> 00:58:19.203]  Get out thousands.
[00:58:19.644 --> 00:58:20.264]  Help us!
[00:58:20.484 --> 00:58:21.886]  Help us expose the terrorist!
[00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:23.647]  None of us are safe while they're out there.
[00:58:24.127 --> 00:58:26.650]  Or go to InfoWars.com and get the high quality DVD.
[00:58:27.603 --> 00:58:31.705]  And crystal clear digital quality with 68 minutes of extras on it.

[00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:45.293]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.046 --> 00:58:57.686]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.347 --> 00:58:59.407]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.127 --> 00:59:01.228]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.888 --> 00:59:02.708]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.448 --> 00:59:04.329]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:08.690]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.211 --> 00:59:13.332]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.214 --> 00:59:21.175]  I got all these callers scrambled.
[00:59:21.775 --> 00:59:23.256]  John, which one disagrees with me?
[00:59:25.669 --> 00:59:26.989]  Edward and Florida, okay.
[00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.190]  Because if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:33.151]  I had this list of calls here and didn't know which one of them disagreed.
[00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:35.072]  Alright, Rush Limbaugh has attacked me.
[00:59:36.012 --> 00:59:38.233]  We're not going to play this because he's talking about me.
[00:59:38.273 --> 00:59:43.075]  The point is they're having to respond and he's lying as usual as a big phony conservative.
[00:59:44.035 --> 00:59:45.875]  Put people in prison if they use drugs!
[00:59:46.095 --> 00:59:47.776]  But let me gobble all I want!
[00:59:47.856 --> 00:59:48.536]  I shouldn't go!
[00:59:48.556 --> 00:59:50.437]  I mean, it's just a decision.
[00:59:50.457 --> 00:59:52.698]  But I don't think you should go to prison, you despicable creature.
[00:59:52.718 --> 00:59:54.118]  You just shouldn't say everybody else should.
[00:59:55.197 --> 00:59:56.578]  So we'll talk about the big liberal.
[00:59:57.158 --> 00:59:58.079]  That's really what he is.
[00:59:58.159 --> 01:00:00.040]  Okay, liberals, you need to quit using that term.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.220]  Let's get into facts.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.061]  That's coming up later.
[01:00:02.401 --> 01:00:07.263]  I'll tell you who that, quote, call from George Bush was to my home office, unlisted number, last Thursday.
[01:00:07.283 --> 01:00:07.924]  We discovered it.
[01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.566]  To kind of give you a hint, my prediction was correct.
[01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:13.027]  It wasn't hard to predict what it was.
[01:00:13.187 --> 01:00:15.688]  It was, well, I will tell you about it later.
[01:00:16.314 --> 01:00:22.618]  And we've got Bill Maher attacking Charlie Sheen coming up and just masses of news on Iran.
[01:00:22.698 --> 01:00:25.400]  Bush changes his reason for being in Iraq again.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.802]  Basically, it's totally jam-packed.
[01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:30.744]  And we have the incredible, wonderful, fantastic news.
[01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:36.788]  84% of Americans not buying the official story, believing they're being lied to to some extent or totally.
[01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:42.754]  And it fits in with all the other numbers we're getting of other polls of 84%, which are unscientific.
[01:00:42.774 --> 01:00:45.236]  This is scientific, believing it's an inside job.
[01:00:45.837 --> 01:00:49.500]  And going to Edward in Florida on the subject of the poll, I'm told he disagrees.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:49.941]  Go ahead.
[01:00:50.802 --> 01:00:55.726]  Hey Alex, I think that we need to be careful about the conclusions that we draw from this poll.
[01:00:56.487 --> 01:01:00.731]  The question that's asked is when it comes to what they knew prior to September 11th.
[01:01:02.128 --> 01:01:09.274]  It doesn't talk about whether people think it's an inside job or whether the official story about... That is not the case, sir.
[01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:10.395]  That is not true.
[01:01:10.795 --> 01:01:12.296]  That is not... Go read it carefully.
[01:01:12.416 --> 01:01:13.237]  I'm reading it right now.
[01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:17.360]  Have you gone and read the Angus Reid deal?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:28.629]  When it comes to what they knew prior to September 11, 2001, about possible terrorist attacks against the U.S., do you think members of the Bush administration are telling the truth
[01:01:29.173 --> 01:01:32.476]  Mostly telling the truth, but hiding something, or are mostly lying.
[01:01:33.077 --> 01:01:35.559]  That has nothing to do with whether it's an inside job.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.221]  Uh, yes it does.
[01:01:37.881 --> 01:01:42.946]  And I just, I disagree with you on what you take away from this poll.
[01:01:43.386 --> 01:01:49.312]  Because in the past they had those polls, and it was 77% thinking they weren't covering up.
[01:01:49.532 --> 01:01:53.616]  The fact that people are saying, hey, the intelligence, it's a broad
[01:01:54.216 --> 01:02:00.441]  A simple question with the intelligence they had, now do you think they're lying, mostly lying, or not lying?
[01:02:00.962 --> 01:02:07.407]  You read that, this certainly shows that 80 plus percent of the American people believe they're being lied to about the official fable.
[01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:14.913]  Yeah, I agree that most of the people that they agreed are being lied to, but I mean, do they think they're being lied to about the fact that...
[01:02:15.213 --> 01:02:17.554]  Let me ask you this question, sir.
[01:02:17.894 --> 01:02:19.135]  This is all interpretation.
[01:02:19.175 --> 01:02:21.496]  I think what you're saying is fair to a certain extent.
[01:02:21.516 --> 01:02:23.557]  I brought that up earlier in the last hour.
[01:02:23.577 --> 01:02:24.658]  I'm sure you heard me say that.
[01:02:25.378 --> 01:02:29.981]  This mirrors the CNN polls of between 80 and 90 percent.
[01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:30.801]  There have been four of them.
[01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:32.302]  One was 80, one was 82, one was 84, one was 90.
[01:02:34.863 --> 01:02:37.024]  This mirrors other polls.
[01:02:37.724 --> 01:02:39.805]  MSN, 61% believing there's a cover-up.
[01:02:40.445 --> 01:02:43.806]  This mirrors the Scripps Howard News Service, 68%.
[01:02:44.206 --> 01:02:47.207]  I'm going from memory on this, but I'm pretty sure I'm accurate on these numbers.
[01:02:47.467 --> 01:02:50.868]  68% believing there's a cover-up, 36% believing total inside job.
[01:02:51.608 --> 01:02:54.809]  And then I do interviews, sir, where I'm being attacked by the host!
[01:02:55.842 --> 01:03:06.029]  On neocon stronghold stations, okay, and on average I'd say one caller out of about 20, on some it might be 40 calls and no one disagrees.
[01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:08.651]  Yeah, I mean, I agree there.
[01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:11.994]  I'm saying this vets what I'm getting organically.
[01:03:13.455 --> 01:03:15.836]  Alright, I got one more question.
[01:03:15.996 --> 01:03:16.437]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:21.140]  Okay, Larry Silverstein in the 2002 PBS documentary America Rebuilds.
[01:03:21.856 --> 01:03:24.958]  He says to the fire commander, alright?
[01:03:25.178 --> 01:03:29.902]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it, and they made the decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:34.225]  Why would Silverstein be telling the fire commander to pull the building?
[01:03:34.725 --> 01:03:36.466]  I think he's trying to put blame on them.
[01:03:36.526 --> 01:03:38.528]  Let me get what you think on the other side, okay?
[01:03:39.128 --> 01:03:40.949]  It's like Bush in the Rose Garden.
[01:03:41.009 --> 01:03:42.070]  I need to get this video.
[01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:42.991]  I have the audio clip.
[01:03:43.011 --> 01:03:44.912]  Well, I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[01:03:45.332 --> 01:03:47.033]  It was exactly a month ago.
[01:03:47.053 --> 01:03:48.635]  Yeah, a month ago today.
[01:03:48.655 --> 01:03:49.155]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:51.864 --> 01:03:56.388]  It's here!
[01:03:56.608 --> 01:04:01.353]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:09.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.089 --> 01:04:17.158]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.539 --> 01:04:24.408]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying.
[01:04:24.918 --> 01:04:28.959]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.259 --> 01:04:32.759]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.140]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.381]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:54.252 --> 01:04:55.293]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:55.613 --> 01:04:58.395]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.655 --> 01:05:02.817]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:04.078]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.398 --> 01:05:08.941]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:11.572]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.053 --> 01:05:26.762]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:52.267 --> 01:05:53.908]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:05:54.228 --> 01:06:01.594]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[01:06:01.774 --> 01:06:09.540]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.821]  And there's no odor.
[01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:21.090]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:29.397]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:35.222]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:38.208]  Alright, coming up in this hour, Rush Limbaugh savaged me and lied
[01:07:04.756 --> 01:07:13.620]  In a bald-faced way, last Thursday, as he does on so many issues as a fake, oxy-cotton, gobbling, phony conservative.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.520]  We'll play that.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.101]  We'll get into the incredible poll.
[01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:21.323]  84% of Americans believe they're being lied to by the Bush administration on 9-11.
[01:07:21.643 --> 01:07:25.364]  And you can, you know, nitpick and say about the intelligence on 9-11.
[01:07:25.384 --> 01:07:26.725]  The point is they know they're being lied to.
[01:07:27.691 --> 01:07:32.374]  This is a very scientific poll and it mirrors the unscientific polls that have been done by CNN and others.
[01:07:32.834 --> 01:07:46.143]  It mirrors what I've gotten on the street and other scientific polls show that the trend is going towards the vast majority believing there's a cover-up and the majority of that majority believing it is an inside job.
[01:07:46.543 --> 01:07:53.448]  No one can doubt from all the datum that the majority of Americans believe there's a cover-up and a large percentage believe it is an inside job.
[01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:56.270]  We were talking about that with the last caller.
[01:07:57.751 --> 01:08:12.900]  Edward, in Florida, his next point was about Silverstein and the pull-it clip, and then we have that clip, and we also have Bush's Rose Garden comments of a month ago that tie into all of this, and so I'm going to go ahead and we'll play that after you make your comments.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.201]  Make your points so I get where you're going with this, Edward.
[01:08:16.182 --> 01:08:21.765]  Yeah, I mean, I'm just wondering, why would Larry Silverstein be telling the fire commander to pull the building?
[01:08:22.703 --> 01:08:25.506]  I mean, was this fire commander in on it?
[01:08:25.686 --> 01:08:27.848]  I mean, can we get a comment from him?
[01:08:28.268 --> 01:08:35.795]  Also, in the 9-11 Mysteries demolition movie, there's a nearby fireman that says, hey, this building is going to come down.
[01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:37.236]  He says, keep an eye on that building.
[01:08:37.276 --> 01:08:38.277]  It's going to come down soon.
[01:08:38.637 --> 01:08:40.479]  How does he know it's going to come down soon?
[01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.140]  Can we get him to testify?
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.302]  That's my point.
[01:08:44.342 --> 01:08:47.585]  I just want to know how these other people know, and can we get info from them?
[01:08:48.647 --> 01:08:50.791]  Well I totally agree and I appreciate your call.
[01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:52.894]  Crooks do this a lot.
[01:08:54.797 --> 01:09:00.867]  They compartmentalize things and they tell good people in plain view what to do.
[01:09:03.726 --> 01:09:10.552]  To make this clear, they just tell them, hey, we're going to have to bring that building down because it's too damaged and we want to save the buildings next to it.
[01:09:10.993 --> 01:09:13.695]  And they just go, okay, go and bring it down.
[01:09:13.735 --> 01:09:17.278]  And then later, peer pressure to the point where you just don't question it.
[01:09:17.338 --> 01:09:19.841]  You consciously decide to go along with it.
[01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:22.603]  I have tried to contact the firefighters you're talking about.
[01:09:22.683 --> 01:09:26.987]  I've contacted firefighters who went public and said bombs were going off in all the buildings.
[01:09:27.007 --> 01:09:28.008]  They've been told to shut up.
[01:09:28.448 --> 01:09:29.890]  A few of them have gone on air.
[01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.071]  I've heard them on other shows.
[01:09:33.065 --> 01:09:37.487]  We've had underwriters and people that did the studies on the buildings go public and say it had to be inside job.
[01:09:38.127 --> 01:09:39.468]  So all of that is happening.
[01:09:39.928 --> 01:09:57.175]  Silverstein, to be clear, Silverstein in 2002, and we didn't learn of this show until 2003, we knew they'd already blown up building 7, the 47 story building that wasn't hit by a plane that day that collapsed at 5, 20 or whatever in the afternoon from small fires on multiple floors.
[01:09:58.672 --> 01:10:04.299]  We know the building had the CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence, and every other federal spook agency you can imagine.
[01:10:04.319 --> 01:10:05.421]  It was a who's who of it.
[01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:09.206]  The city and county and state command bunker was in it.
[01:10:11.168 --> 01:10:12.350]  Which is an oxymoron.
[01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.972]  It was in the 30-something floor up there.
[01:10:14.887 --> 01:10:24.158]  We know that they'd already moved the command center out in the days before for Tripod 2, a FEMA terrorist attack drill on the World Trade Center complex.
[01:10:24.418 --> 01:10:28.262]  So they moved the command base into mobile command centers to the end of the pier.
[01:10:28.863 --> 01:10:30.966]  We know that Giuliani
[01:10:32.914 --> 01:10:36.115]  Right after the tower's collapse, we got live with Peter Jennings.
[01:10:36.155 --> 01:10:43.776]  We have that clip up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the WTC7 section, and said, we've been told to get out of the building, Building 7.
[01:10:44.397 --> 01:10:46.357]  That's before fires even started in it.
[01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:55.099]  We know they then claimed that no one died in the building, but a Secret Service agent, who probably saw too much, did die in Building 7, despite the fact the North Tower did not hit it.
[01:10:55.139 --> 01:10:57.739]  A few windows got broken out by bouncing debris.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.900]  Some of the dust field, obviously, did hit it.
[01:11:01.753 --> 01:11:05.074]  But no substantive structural piece of the North or South Tower hit it.
[01:11:06.074 --> 01:11:09.956]  I mean, it's like 500 feet or something from the North Tower.
[01:11:09.976 --> 01:11:11.836]  I mean, it was outside the complex.
[01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:16.918]  If you look at diagrams of it, it was actually outside of what was really the Port Authority Complex.
[01:11:18.018 --> 01:11:19.218]  But it was owned by Silverstein.
[01:11:19.258 --> 01:11:24.260]  I mean, I'd be surprised if it wasn't in Toronto or something, you know, hundreds of miles away and collapsed.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.901]  I mean, it's just... Or, you know, maybe buildings he owns in San Francisco would have collapsed.
[01:11:28.961 --> 01:11:29.601]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:31.302]  It's unbelievable.
[01:11:32.193 --> 01:11:32.553]  All right.
[01:11:33.434 --> 01:11:34.776]  I mean, that's how stupid this is.
[01:11:34.816 --> 01:11:39.300]  And in the piece, right before it, they're talking about demolishing wreckage of buildings.
[01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:44.204]  How they demolished five, and how they demolished six, and how they got rid of the wreckage of four.
[01:11:44.825 --> 01:11:50.410]  And you've got the head engineer going, getting ready to tow building six.
[01:11:51.111 --> 01:11:53.733]  You know, he's a southern guy there with controlled demolition.
[01:11:53.753 --> 01:11:55.595]  We've got to cue all that up and just play it.
[01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:57.397]  Then they cut to seven and they go,
[01:11:58.977 --> 01:12:02.359]  Seven was rebuilt first because it totally demolished.
[01:12:02.599 --> 01:12:04.500]  And then they used the same turn pullet.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.243]  I mean, on the same show, pullet is demolishing one.
[01:12:10.804 --> 01:12:20.850]  They detonate charges and they have ropes tied to it with huge cranes to make sure it falls one way so it doesn't damage the larish slurry wall.
[01:12:21.231 --> 01:12:23.452]  The guy speaking in New York accent at the point of
[01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:32.131]  It's the slurry wall, I guess, that blocks the swamp off of the river there.
[01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:36.393]  But he goes, we wanted to pull it so it wouldn't hurt the legislary wall.
[01:12:37.473 --> 01:12:38.614]  Is it slurry wall?
[01:12:38.634 --> 01:12:40.414]  They call it a legislary?
[01:12:41.595 --> 01:12:43.015]  So you can go watch all that.
[01:12:43.035 --> 01:12:44.556]  They're saying, we're pulling Building 6.
[01:12:46.354 --> 01:12:54.819]  Then they cut from southerner to head New York engineer for the Port Authority talking about how they pulled it.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.503]  With explosives on the pillars and then with giant cables so it would fall one direction.
[01:13:00.523 --> 01:13:01.604]  There's different ways of doing this.
[01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:03.105]  So it wouldn't damage the wall.
[01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:07.147]  So here is... What do you have queued up first?
[01:13:07.187 --> 01:13:08.308]  Do you have Silverstein?
[01:13:09.088 --> 01:13:09.889]  Play Silverstein.
[01:13:09.909 --> 01:13:10.269]  Here he is.
[01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:14.692]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander.
[01:13:15.507 --> 01:13:18.048]  Telling you that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:13:19.668 --> 01:13:21.649]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:24.610]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:27.571]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:13:27.891 --> 01:13:31.592]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[01:13:33.033 --> 01:13:38.174]  I know since we first played these on air back in 2003, you've heard it over and over again in all the other shows.
[01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:39.635]  But let's hear it again.
[01:13:39.675 --> 01:13:42.136]  Can you go find the clip where they pull building six?
[01:13:42.176 --> 01:13:43.116]  I think it's pull six.
[01:13:44.723 --> 01:13:52.989]  Now this is just seconds after this, in the same documentary, they're pulling six, and blowing it up is called pulling it.
[01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:55.511]  Okay, so there's no debate what this means in the film.
[01:13:57.193 --> 01:14:04.098]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction has leveled World Trade Center buildings four and five.
[01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:07.460]  Hello?
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.003]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building six.
[01:14:13.769 --> 01:14:16.150]  We had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:25.155]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:14:27.256 --> 01:14:29.337]  By the way, there's that great clip.
[01:14:29.357 --> 01:14:38.002]  Again, I've talked to these firefighters, I've talked to NPR, which doesn't have the tapes anymore, where they announced on NPR in New York that the building was going to be brought down by Controlled Demo, Building 7.
[01:14:39.569 --> 01:14:41.610]  And there are firefighter tapes of this that we played.
[01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:51.695]  But yeah, in 9-11 Ministries, which we have on DVD, which I suggest you get right now, they have the firefighter right there on tape going, yeah, we're getting ready to pull down building 7.
[01:14:52.075 --> 01:14:53.095]  It's about to come down.
[01:14:53.956 --> 01:15:00.459]  From the time they told Giuliani to get out of the building at 10-something before the fires start, how obvious is this?
[01:15:01.266 --> 01:15:02.627]  They're telling them it's going to come down.
[01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.187]  Get out, it's going to come down!
[01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:07.128]  The firemen, okay, they told me it's going to come down.
[01:15:07.148 --> 01:15:08.289]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:10.450]  I mean, you know, how much more obvious?
[01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:17.372]  But then buildings like 4, 5, and 6 that I mean had North and South Tower fall on them.
[01:15:18.253 --> 01:15:21.154]  Bankers trust that had the South Tower fall into it.
[01:15:21.923 --> 01:15:23.104]  Burns for days!
[01:15:23.444 --> 01:15:24.325]  It doesn't collapse.
[01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:30.811]  Because giant steel, 4 foot around, 6 foot around, 3 foot around columns don't melt in normal fire.
[01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:35.135]  Just like the metal in your fireplace with white hot coals on it.
[01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:39.799]  For 50 years, that iron or steel, and iron is not even as strong as steel, it's never going to melt.
[01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:44.203]  Your stove top isn't going to melt with white hot, blue hot flames on it.
[01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:47.792]  You can baste it in the furnaces of Hades!
[01:15:48.092 --> 01:15:51.053]  If it doesn't get up until 2300 degrees, it's not going to weaken.
[01:15:51.633 --> 01:15:54.234]  And it's not going to melt until 3000 plus.
[01:15:57.795 --> 01:15:59.836]  It's scientific fact!
[01:15:59.996 --> 01:16:02.276]  It's like the world is round, okay?
[01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:04.457]  Jet fuel doesn't burn those columns.
[01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:05.437]  The world is round.
[01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:06.217]  Doesn't weaken them.
[01:16:06.438 --> 01:16:07.238]  The world is round.
[01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:12.079]  When they say it does, they're telling you the world is a pancake with sea monsters out on the edge of it.
[01:16:12.119 --> 01:16:14.280]  They're going to eat you if you try to sail past them.
[01:16:15.285 --> 01:16:15.565]  Okay?
[01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:16.565]  It isn't true, folks.
[01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:19.426]  The world isn't flat, and the government carried out 9-11, okay?
[01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:20.486]  Period.
[01:16:20.886 --> 01:16:21.567]  There's no debating it.
[01:16:22.107 --> 01:16:24.447]  Now, here's why I think he should the fireman.
[01:16:25.068 --> 01:16:27.968]  Criminals like to plant things in their alibis and stories.
[01:16:28.408 --> 01:16:36.570]  Bush at the Rose Garden now claiming they found out the terrorists involved in 9-11 wanted to plant bombs high in the buildings to make them blow up and rain down on people.
[01:16:36.951 --> 01:16:42.652]  And then if it ever comes out fully on 9-11, they'll just spit it and go, well, we told you through torture we found out they put bombs in.
[01:16:43.835 --> 01:16:46.496]  A bunch of the neocons they've got out there have now admitted it.
[01:16:46.817 --> 01:16:48.097]  I've been in national debates with them.
[01:16:48.117 --> 01:16:48.517]  You've heard it.
[01:16:49.398 --> 01:16:53.200]  And they say, oh, yes, I do think that the Muslims put bombs in the buildings.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.681]  So, they're already saying this and setting it up.
[01:16:55.921 --> 01:16:57.302]  Here's a month ago in the Rose Garden.
[01:16:57.502 --> 01:16:59.343]  By the way, if you've got video of this, folks, send it to us.
[01:16:59.383 --> 01:17:00.283]  All we have is the audio.
[01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:00.923]  Here it is.
[01:17:02.104 --> 01:17:12.309]  The information that the Central Intelligence Agency has obtained by questioning men like Khaliq Sheikh Mohammed has provided valuable information and has helped
[01:17:12.941 --> 01:17:16.083]  Disrupt terrorist plots including strikes within the United States.
[01:17:19.084 --> 01:17:23.987]  For example, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed described the design of planned attacks on buildings inside the U.S.
[01:17:24.027 --> 01:17:27.349]  and how operatives were directed to carry them out.
[01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:36.654]  That is valuable information for those of us who have the responsibility to protect the American people.
[01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:48.429]  He told us the operatives had been instructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a high point, a point that was high enough to prevent people trapped above from escaping.
[01:17:50.989 --> 01:17:58.571]  He gave us information that helped uncover al-Qaeda cells... Okay, so notice how nervous he was when he said that he had to get that just right.
[01:17:59.812 --> 01:18:05.113]  Okay, and so you have Silberstein trying to claim that the firefighters gave the order to blow it up.
[01:18:05.613 --> 01:18:08.154]  Because it was already a big controversy, they'd clearly blown up seven.
[01:18:09.241 --> 01:18:20.831]  And then for a year, almost two years, 2003-2005, late 2005, we called his office twenty times, everybody else had a hundred times, I mean everybody called.
[01:18:20.851 --> 01:18:22.913]  We tried to call the firemen, no one would talk.
[01:18:23.134 --> 01:18:26.156]  They wouldn't say if they had or if they hadn't, because they didn't know what to say.
[01:18:26.176 --> 01:18:29.579]  Because this was, you know, they had to all get together and powwow.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.583]  Then finally through one of his spokesmen, through a New York Daily News article,
[01:18:34.736 --> 01:18:36.657]  Silverstein says, oh, we meant pull the firemen out.
[01:18:37.017 --> 01:18:37.677]  There's a problem.
[01:18:37.717 --> 01:18:39.758]  Firemen were never in the building after 10 a.m.
[01:18:42.198 --> 01:18:43.079]  So what does that mean?
[01:18:43.779 --> 01:18:44.879]  And the fires hadn't started.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.760]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:18:48.941 --> 01:18:50.101]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[01:18:52.935 --> 01:18:58.017]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:18:58.077 --> 01:19:05.399]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:19:05.539 --> 01:19:16.162]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:19:16.383 --> 01:19:20.924]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:21.204 --> 01:19:26.189]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:19:26.389 --> 01:19:29.352]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:29.572 --> 01:19:39.382]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:19:39.482 --> 01:19:41.684]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:41.704 --> 01:19:46.407]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:46.467 --> 01:19:48.428]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:48.448 --> 01:19:49.189]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.211 --> 01:20:14.814]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:15.735 --> 01:20:23.000]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.063]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:27.303 --> 01:20:32.686]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:20:34.988 --> 01:20:35.168]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:44.257]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:45.038]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.058 --> 01:20:45.358]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.301 --> 01:20:59.622]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:20:59.922 --> 01:21:05.203]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:21:05.624 --> 01:21:08.624]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:58.752]  Alright, I've been a bad boy.
[01:22:58.772 --> 01:23:00.112]  I haven't taken a lot of your calls yet.
[01:23:00.152 --> 01:23:01.372]  Let's take a whole bunch of them now.
[01:23:01.392 --> 01:23:09.274]  I'm going to move quickly through your calls at 1-800-259-9231 and all those clips of Limbaugh and the rest of it are coming up.
[01:23:10.394 --> 01:23:11.594]  Cameron in Australia.
[01:23:11.915 --> 01:23:12.875]  You're a real trooper.
[01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:14.855]  I forgot we had a call from Australia.
[01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:15.475]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:16.335 --> 01:23:16.836]  Hello.
[01:23:17.776 --> 01:23:18.316]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:23:18.336 --> 01:23:18.916]  What's on your mind?
[01:23:19.948 --> 01:23:21.349]  A lot of things actually.
[01:23:21.449 --> 01:23:27.011]  Perhaps I first start a word about you from Dr. Tierney.
[01:23:27.811 --> 01:23:28.811]  Anyway, let's see.
[01:23:29.172 --> 01:23:35.374]  Our government's doing a lot of parallel things to what your government's doing, particularly your HR 6166.
[01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:40.436]  We had a station law drafted about a year ago here.
[01:23:41.365 --> 01:23:55.483]  Which had the same sort of draconian measures almost to the point where after hearing what you said about HR 6166 that we are having, how will you put it, a parallel
[01:23:57.488 --> 01:23:58.550]  It's all parallel.
[01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:00.713]  Every program has similar names.
[01:24:01.354 --> 01:24:03.958]  England has passed laws abolishing the Magna Carta.
[01:24:04.499 --> 01:24:07.103]  Our government has passed a law abolishing the Bill of Rights.
[01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:12.551]  And yes, Australia has passed very draconian laws getting rid of due process everything.
[01:24:13.789 --> 01:24:14.069]  Really?
[01:24:14.109 --> 01:24:20.131]  Yeah, well, my dad said after he studied it that it's worse than what your bores are, supposedly.
[01:24:20.471 --> 01:24:24.772]  You'd think it was maybe drafted in the United States or by the neocons, by the founder.
[01:24:25.132 --> 01:24:34.675]  The other thing, some other parallels that are interesting is, or some quick points that I've gone through, Australia's supplying uranium to China again, encouraged by the United States.
[01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:44.154]  When the Sedition Laws were passed, we tripled our ACO, which is our intelligence agency, just like your Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
[01:24:45.075 --> 01:24:53.781]  Our asylum-seeker detention camps, because they used their political science and fear to get re-elected here over border policies.
[01:24:54.922 --> 01:25:01.527]  When they stopped detaining people for years and years that weren't white or speak English or Christian or whatever,
[01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:08.833]  What they did is, the same day they said that they were going to be reused or something, I thought, detention camps!
[01:25:09.073 --> 01:25:09.593]  Exactly!
[01:25:09.613 --> 01:25:11.034]  No, no, no, this was written here.
[01:25:11.614 --> 01:25:20.838]  In RECS 84, written up by Oliver North, it says that they would claim, I've got Senate hearings on this, that it was for illegal aliens, but it's really for citizens.
[01:25:21.319 --> 01:25:25.000]  Now it's in our papers that it's, quote, for illegal aliens and for citizens.
[01:25:26.061 --> 01:25:26.821]  Yeah, in Australia.
[01:25:27.502 --> 01:25:30.323]  Well, see, but exactly, the same thing there is happening here.
[01:25:31.215 --> 01:25:31.455]  Yes.
[01:25:31.796 --> 01:25:33.397]  It's the same playbook!
[01:25:33.437 --> 01:25:34.358]  It's the same playbook!
[01:25:35.258 --> 01:25:39.181]  Yeah, I hear what you're saying over there, and then I see the same parallels here.
[01:25:39.522 --> 01:25:44.405]  Obviously, you've got Steve Watson and people in the UK that can tell you what parallels are happening in the same way.
[01:25:44.425 --> 01:25:44.906]  Same thing.
[01:25:45.686 --> 01:25:53.352]  However, I don't see a lot of traction here in Australia, and I think we're sort of miles behind, both, usually, England gets covered, and so does...
[01:25:55.059 --> 01:26:01.964]  I have seen that in the statistics that Australia is not awake as the US or England.
[01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:03.305]  Why do you think that is?
[01:26:04.506 --> 01:26:08.809]  Well, I think the tide is turning.
[01:26:08.829 --> 01:26:10.750]  It's moving slowly.
[01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:18.196]  It's the distinctive 100 monkey syndrome, as David Icke calls it, where there are people becoming more aware over time.
[01:26:18.516 --> 01:26:24.300]  We do have more critical media of America, as you mentioned on a program the other day, especially in the Murdoch Press.
[01:26:25.081 --> 01:26:26.262]  But a lot of it is fluff.
[01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:34.286]  Yeah, so basically, I want to hear from more Aussies that feel the same way.
[01:26:34.306 --> 01:26:36.787]  I can give out two websites for Australian listeners.
[01:26:36.908 --> 01:26:45.012]  One is www.911ofs.com and one mentions www.guyaguys.net.
[01:26:46.553 --> 01:26:48.074]  But I don't see what it's for.
[01:26:48.114 --> 01:26:52.716]  You're on a... You're on a... Sure, just 9-11 Truth Australia, you should find it.
[01:26:53.016 --> 01:26:54.317]  You're on an IP phone, aren't you?
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.486]  No, I'm on a mobile telephone.
[01:26:57.987 --> 01:27:00.052]  Oh wow, you're calling international on a mobile.
[01:27:00.112 --> 01:27:00.974]  It was just cutting out.
[01:27:01.274 --> 01:27:02.658]  What was the second address again?
[01:27:03.787 --> 01:27:11.093]  Second address was GaiaGuys, G-A-I-A-G-U-Y-F dot net.
[01:27:11.573 --> 01:27:12.213]  Absolutely.
[01:27:12.273 --> 01:27:15.536]  In fact, I'd like to have some folks from Australian 9-11 Truth on.
[01:27:15.936 --> 01:27:16.837]  I know they're over there.
[01:27:16.897 --> 01:27:18.338]  I know their numbers are growing.
[01:27:18.678 --> 01:27:20.139]  We need to all support each other.
[01:27:20.199 --> 01:27:21.160]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:21.640]  Take care.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:30.847]  Yeah, I'd like to, you know, maybe we'd have more time to have me or someone else on that has notes about some of the issues here, because there's no way
[01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:35.633]  We only want to get Australians interested because they think, oh, that's overseas politics in America.
[01:27:35.653 --> 01:27:37.213]  Who cares about that here?
[01:27:37.433 --> 01:27:39.834]  You know, that sort of attitude, I guess, we get.
[01:27:40.174 --> 01:27:43.835]  And Aussies have this old thing in Aussie culture, she'll be right, mate.
[01:27:46.156 --> 01:27:48.417]  So that's an old Australian saying.
[01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:50.958]  But, you know, I guess the government we've had
[01:27:57.165 --> 01:27:59.226]  Well, I wouldn't even really call it right wing.
[01:27:59.266 --> 01:28:00.446]  I mean, I wouldn't call it right wing.
[01:28:00.466 --> 01:28:06.587]  They act conservative to fool the good conservatives of Australia into going along with the loss of their freedoms.
[01:28:06.627 --> 01:28:09.808]  But listen, I really appreciate you coming on with us and take care.
[01:28:09.828 --> 01:28:11.809]  Good to hear from you from the land down under.
[01:28:11.829 --> 01:28:13.229]  We get calls now every day.
[01:28:13.929 --> 01:28:16.249]  And many times from different listeners in Australia.
[01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:28.652]  Calls from Japan, calls from China, South Korea, Russia, Spain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Mexico, Puerto Rico, all over the place.
[01:28:29.312 --> 01:28:32.912]  Call a free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:33.753 --> 01:28:41.214]  Joe, who's been holding, Paul, and many others, Cameron, we'll get to Eddie and many others, just stay with us.
[01:28:43.101 --> 01:28:46.105]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.026 --> 01:28:49.689]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.587 --> 01:28:55.909]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:56.169 --> 01:28:58.211]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:28:58.351 --> 01:29:05.396]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:29:05.676 --> 01:29:14.223]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:29:14.343 --> 01:29:14.563]  Yes!
[01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:19.268]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:29:19.408 --> 01:29:23.452]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:29:23.653 --> 01:29:26.095]  It's earth friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[01:29:26.255 --> 01:29:30.600]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:34.003 --> 01:29:37.546]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[01:29:37.726 --> 01:29:40.168]  Call today for a Calbin Soap Catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:40.188 --> 01:29:41.549]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[01:29:41.569 --> 01:29:43.951]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:29:52.961 --> 01:29:55.984]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:56.284 --> 01:30:01.208]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.468 --> 01:30:05.831]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.112 --> 01:30:15.039]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.239 --> 01:30:18.882]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.142 --> 01:30:24.171]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.491 --> 01:30:31.183]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:31.678 --> 01:30:32.318]  What about you?
[01:30:32.979 --> 01:30:38.342]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:38.382 --> 01:30:39.483]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:39.563 --> 01:30:41.464]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.351 --> 01:30:55.832]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:55.953 --> 01:30:58.314]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:58.374 --> 01:31:05.458]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[01:31:06.038 --> 01:31:08.340]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.542]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.082 --> 01:31:17.225]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:20.747]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:24.651]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:25.391 --> 01:31:31.133]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:31.193 --> 01:31:35.575]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:35.955 --> 01:31:38.136]  For the following two free reports.
[01:31:39.016 --> 01:31:39.296]  U.S.
[01:31:39.396 --> 01:31:42.337]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:31:43.257 --> 01:31:45.558]  Call 888-XANADU.
[01:31:45.618 --> 01:31:49.799]  That's 888-XANADU.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.100]  And ask for George.
[01:31:54.067 --> 01:31:58.970]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:59.691 --> 01:32:01.813]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:16.648 --> 01:32:18.090]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:19.672]  Thank you again for joining us today.
[01:32:19.692 --> 01:32:29.043]  I'm going to put in a little plug for the documentary films, and we're going to go to Andrew in Japan, Joe in Wisconsin, Paul in Canada, Brad in Kentucky, and many others.
[01:32:29.123 --> 01:32:32.027]  Wide open phones for the rest of the broadcast, but I've got a bunch of other news.
[01:32:33.271 --> 01:32:34.851]  Coming up, look at this story.
[01:32:34.951 --> 01:32:39.292]  Police want spy planes to fight anti-social behavior.
[01:32:39.332 --> 01:32:41.253]  See, first it's to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:32:41.313 --> 01:32:44.513]  Then it's, oh, we're going to fight illegal aliens because they know that's popular.
[01:32:44.573 --> 01:32:46.514]  And then, actually, they're not going to be for that.
[01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:53.315]  Every major city, not just in the U.S., but in England and everywhere else, will have little drones watching you.
[01:32:54.616 --> 01:32:59.037]  Pretty soon they're going to hand out black sunglasses and we're going to find out that they live real or something.
[01:32:59.877 --> 01:33:01.217]  If you haven't seen the movie, you won't get it.
[01:33:02.031 --> 01:33:04.473]  We'll play the Limbaugh clip and analyze his lies about us.
[01:33:04.513 --> 01:33:19.683]  We'll also play the attack on Charlie Sheen, the dastardly little comments by the creature over there on HBO, the person posing as a liberal, the phony anti-establishment individual Bill Maher.
[01:33:20.644 --> 01:33:22.585]  So that's all coming up, in fact, before this hour ends.
[01:33:23.206 --> 01:33:25.187]  But I do want to encourage you.
[01:33:26.551 --> 01:33:34.000]  To join us in this fight, to be part of this historical fight and also support this radio show and my websites and what we do here.
[01:33:35.281 --> 01:33:38.044]  Terror Storm is available on DVD.
[01:33:39.941 --> 01:33:43.964]  It is roughly a two-hour film with 68 minutes of extras.
[01:33:44.384 --> 01:33:47.306]  There's over three hours on the DVD.
[01:33:47.467 --> 01:33:50.949]  68 minutes of the highlights of the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium.
[01:33:51.509 --> 01:33:56.413]  Just that 68 minutes is very effective, covering every angle of 9-11 you can imagine.
[01:33:58.311 --> 01:34:00.573]  I mean, the 19 bucks is worth it just for that.
[01:34:00.613 --> 01:34:14.202]  And then you've got the full-length feature film, Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terror, Gulf of Tonkin, the USS Liberty, we cover Hitler's attack on Poland, how he staged that, stuff we haven't covered before.
[01:34:14.642 --> 01:34:25.329]  Then we cover 7-7 being a government operation, the Madrid bombing being a government operation, British carrying out other terror attacks in Iraq, staging and posing as Arabs,
[01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:35.042]  We then get into the propaganda that takes us to war, the lies, the fake news, the NSA spying, the CIA torture.
[01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:37.244]  It's all in TerrorStorm.
[01:34:37.264 --> 01:34:38.566]  Then we look at media propaganda.
[01:34:38.826 --> 01:34:39.888]  It's fast moving.
[01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:42.491]  It really covers about eight different subjects.
[01:34:43.234 --> 01:34:44.455]  And it's highly produced.
[01:34:44.495 --> 01:34:45.416]  It's my best film.
[01:34:45.476 --> 01:34:47.258]  Please get Terror Storm.
[01:34:47.318 --> 01:34:48.019]  Give it as a gift.
[01:34:48.059 --> 01:34:48.840]  A birthday present.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.823]  Buy ten copies and give it as an early gift.
[01:34:51.843 --> 01:34:53.344]  Say, I'm not giving presents this year.
[01:34:53.364 --> 01:34:57.228]  I'm not going to go out and fight traffic and go into debt and buy stuff people don't want.
[01:34:57.769 --> 01:34:58.569]  Buy one copy.
[01:34:58.609 --> 01:35:00.391]  Make copies of it and give that as a gift.
[01:35:00.792 --> 01:35:02.874]  Give them a card and say, here's a...
[01:35:04.352 --> 01:35:08.535]  Some email addresses, I mean some web addresses where you can learn more, and here's a copy of a film.
[01:35:08.695 --> 01:35:09.255]  I don't care.
[01:35:09.395 --> 01:35:10.416]  Give them originals.
[01:35:10.436 --> 01:35:14.379]  We've got them as low as, Terror Storms as low as $9.95 when you get a bunch of copies of them.
[01:35:14.759 --> 01:35:17.901]  Some of my films are as low as $5.95 when you get multiple copies.
[01:35:18.121 --> 01:35:24.105]  Go to Infowars.com and get American Dictators, get Order of Death, get Martial Law, get Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:24.905 --> 01:35:31.690]  Get all the other books and videos we carry, like the new film with Griffin that just came out, that we now have.
[01:35:32.611 --> 01:35:36.434]  Get the 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, which we have.
[01:35:36.694 --> 01:35:38.775]  Get Loose Change 2nd Edition, which we have in stock.
[01:35:39.256 --> 01:35:41.917]  We got big discounts, a lot of different specials up there.
[01:35:42.078 --> 01:35:44.719]  So you're not just supporting us, you're supporting these other filmmakers.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.402]  Take action now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:49.783]  We're having a huge effect.
[01:35:49.823 --> 01:35:50.924]  People are waking up.
[01:35:52.461 --> 01:36:02.825]  But there's still a lot of people that don't know, and that'll be the percentage of people that aid this Hitlerian group of criminals, these despots, in trying to set up open martial law in this country.
[01:36:02.905 --> 01:36:03.746]  And it is happening.
[01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:08.708]  But I tell you, looking at it, I think they're going to get their hind ends kicked if they try it.
[01:36:08.768 --> 01:36:09.648]  It's going to be bad, though.
[01:36:09.688 --> 01:36:14.570]  So the more people we get awake before they go to the next phase, the better it is for everybody.
[01:36:15.623 --> 01:36:21.291]  So again, InfoWars.com to order via the safe secure online video and bookstore or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:21.311 --> 01:36:21.351]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:29.844 --> 01:36:30.725]  Or you can write to me.
[01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:36.169]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:39.832]  Or see all my films right now.
[01:36:39.972 --> 01:36:41.253]  All 15 of my films.
[01:36:41.834 --> 01:36:45.697]  Dozens and dozens of other films we've been authorized to post by their authors and makers.
[01:36:46.137 --> 01:36:51.682]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV show, special video reports, my films weeks before they're available.
[01:36:51.942 --> 01:36:53.864]  Some cases months before they're available on DVD.
[01:36:55.405 --> 01:36:59.928]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, you can get TerrorStorm for free at Google Video, but it's a decent copy.
[01:37:00.528 --> 01:37:04.391]  But you get, I mean, it's almost as good as TV, the high quality download we've got.
[01:37:05.413 --> 01:37:10.636]  And even, I guess, if you've got a dial-up, you can still, I guess, take five hours and download it, but if you've got a T1, a few minutes.
[01:37:12.037 --> 01:37:13.798]  It's just a great activist tool.
[01:37:13.818 --> 01:37:18.621]  You know what you can do with that super high-quality version we've got up there for presentplanet.tv members?
[01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:20.302]  It is an activist center.
[01:37:20.342 --> 01:37:26.126]  It is a library of audio interviews, video interviews, in-the-field reports waiting for you.
[01:37:26.886 --> 01:37:30.708]  We have them in low resolution, medium, and high.
[01:37:30.989 --> 01:37:34.751]  In some cases, we have them in four resolutions, one of them being super high.
[01:37:35.387 --> 01:37:37.048]  I mean, it looks almost as good as TV.
[01:37:37.949 --> 01:37:39.109]  Almost as good as cable.
[01:37:39.670 --> 01:37:56.140]  And, uh, think of the activist power of you getting a hundred DVDs or a hundred discs, even, and going and burning those, downloading them and burning them, burning the TV shows, burning the special reports, burning all my films to discs.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:57.100]  Please!
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:57.600]  Help us!
[01:37:59.036 --> 01:38:00.317]  People say, why are you so hyped up?
[01:38:00.377 --> 01:38:01.298]  Why are you so upset?
[01:38:01.318 --> 01:38:01.778]  Think about it.
[01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:15.348]  If I really believe criminal elements of the government carried out 9-11, if I really believe they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, if I really believe they're poisoning us, if I really believe they're hurtling us toward World War III, if I really believe and know they abolished the Bill of Rights with H.R.
[01:38:15.368 --> 01:38:22.714]  6166, which is true, I mean, I believe it, it is the truth, then we've got to be, like, desperate, like, wake up!
[01:38:22.794 --> 01:38:25.196]  I mean, it's like at the end of the Body Snatcher movie.
[01:38:26.303 --> 01:38:35.049]  The old black and white one, where he's running from the body snatchers, you know, in human form, and he gets out to the highway outside the town, he sees all these bustling cars, he runs up to army trucks, he's saying, Help me!
[01:38:35.089 --> 01:38:35.410]  Stop!
[01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.690]  Stop!
[01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:36.210]  They're everywhere!
[01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:37.271]  It's an enemy invasion!
[01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:41.314]  And he runs to try to climb in the back of the truck, and there's pods in there.
[01:38:41.914 --> 01:38:43.976]  And he jumps out, and he's going, We're in danger!
[01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:44.556]  Listen!
[01:38:44.596 --> 01:38:45.377]  They're here!
[01:38:45.657 --> 01:38:50.781]  You've got to... I mean, that's how I feel, but it's our own species, it's our own people doing this to us.
[01:38:51.565 --> 01:38:56.667]  It's just as horrible if it was, you know, pod people from the Clulax system.
[01:38:57.507 --> 01:39:04.109]  And, I mean, I'm literally... Folks, sometimes I'll just start in the grocery store line, especially what usually sets me off is, do you have a discount card?
[01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:05.290]  Well, you saved a lot of money, and you did.
[01:39:05.650 --> 01:39:06.750]  And I'm like, that's for tracking me.
[01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:07.571]  Oh, sure it is.
[01:39:07.591 --> 01:39:08.491]  And I go, that's it!
[01:39:08.631 --> 01:39:10.652]  This entire country's turning into a control grid.
[01:39:10.912 --> 01:39:14.533]  I went shopping with my wife Saturday night, a rare occurrence to the mall.
[01:39:15.753 --> 01:39:16.714]  I'll tell that story next time.
[01:39:16.734 --> 01:39:17.394]  Let me write that down.
[01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:19.841]  Shopping experience.
[01:39:19.921 --> 01:39:21.482]  And she just finally said, I accept it.
[01:39:21.562 --> 01:39:22.442]  It's embarrassing for her.
[01:39:23.042 --> 01:39:26.163]  We were in about ten different shops buying our children clothes and things like that.
[01:39:26.663 --> 01:39:27.724]  Not, about eight different shops.
[01:39:28.404 --> 01:39:30.805]  And I just, I started just shooting my mouth off loud.
[01:39:30.825 --> 01:39:35.366]  Because you push big brother on me, baby, I get real loud in your store!
[01:39:36.644 --> 01:39:39.466]  By the way, I was brought up not to complain if there was a fly in my soup.
[01:39:39.767 --> 01:39:41.568]  I was brought up to be very genteel and nice.
[01:39:41.868 --> 01:39:43.570]  My parents are very genteel, actually.
[01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:45.892]  And I don't like to complain.
[01:39:45.912 --> 01:39:47.033]  I don't like to gripe at people.
[01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:50.596]  You push Big Brother on me, I get loud!
[01:39:52.142 --> 01:39:56.983]  And I roll down windows and say, tune in to KLBJ 590, tune in to 100.1 Radio Free Austin.
[01:39:57.323 --> 01:40:02.704]  I roll down my windows, and I sit there, and when I'm in another city that I'm on the radio, I roll down the window.
[01:40:02.884 --> 01:40:05.805]  Because let me tell you something, this is serious business.
[01:40:05.845 --> 01:40:07.205]  Now I'm moving quick here, I said I would.
[01:40:07.805 --> 01:40:09.105]  Andrew in Japan, go ahead.
[01:40:09.125 --> 01:40:12.706]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:40:12.746 --> 01:40:13.166]  Thank you.
[01:40:14.687 --> 01:40:18.587]  Um, yeah, I just wanted to overhear the exact opposite.
[01:40:18.607 --> 01:40:21.268]  People don't look at it like Big Brother's being pushed on them.
[01:40:21.775 --> 01:40:26.878]  Here at all the ATMs, they're already fitted with the biometric scan, with the thumbprint scanning.
[01:40:27.439 --> 01:40:29.360]  And it's common here.
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:29.960]  People do it.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:33.403]  They don't even think twice about it being there.
[01:40:33.443 --> 01:40:36.044]  Well, they know it's there to trick you, but they don't care.
[01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:41.988]  Sure, Japanese are some of the most intelligent, most well-educated people, and I admire a lot of aspects of their culture.
[01:40:42.008 --> 01:40:45.670]  We have a lot of Japanese listeners, but I've got to tell you, they are imperially conditioned.
[01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:47.131]  They are slave conditioned.
[01:40:47.151 --> 01:40:50.253]  Now, a samurai wanted to test out a new sword.
[01:40:51.747 --> 01:40:55.675]  Would just go chop up one of his rice pickers because they looked at him wrong.
[01:40:56.257 --> 01:40:58.120]  But he would go out looking for someone.
[01:40:58.201 --> 01:41:02.529]  It's total alpha male dominance, alpha female dominance, whatever.
[01:41:03.254 --> 01:41:06.755]  Totally compact, you know, 90-some percent, nothing built on it.
[01:41:07.135 --> 01:41:08.415]  Everyone heard it in the compact.
[01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:15.577]  And whereas the Japanese will believe it's an inside job, and they'll know it, and they're smart, they will still accept it and serve it.
[01:41:15.597 --> 01:41:17.297]  And it's just like the British, to a lesser extent.
[01:41:17.637 --> 01:41:26.780]  They took the most barbarous, hardcore, fighting Japanese tribes, and they beat them into submission and conditioned them to bow and stoop and, quote, be genteel.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:28.580]  It's domestication.
[01:41:29.506 --> 01:41:31.628]  And to do all of that, it's like the British.
[01:41:31.648 --> 01:41:32.408]  They're very quiet.
[01:41:32.569 --> 01:41:33.429]  They're very reserved.
[01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:34.710]  They bow to each other.
[01:41:34.951 --> 01:41:36.432]  They do all the same bull.
[01:41:37.162 --> 01:41:37.742]  And you know what?
[01:41:38.022 --> 01:41:43.384]  I'm one of these conditioned Germanic, you know, tribe, uh, you know, Mongol people that got into the U.S.
[01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:47.486]  and went wild again, and I'm, and the genes are in me, and I'm just, RAAH!
[01:41:47.606 --> 01:41:49.667]  I'm just in the cage of RAAH!
[01:41:50.027 --> 01:41:51.027]  I see what they're doing!
[01:41:51.107 --> 01:41:56.209]  I've got the intellect, I've got all the same smarts, you know, that the Europeans have, but I'm wild, man!
[01:41:56.649 --> 01:42:01.531]  Plus, it was wild Europeans, people that had the genes to begin with to be wild, who came here to begin with.
[01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:03.472]  Or it was blacks under adversity.
[01:42:03.932 --> 01:42:05.193]  You know, it's the same thing.
[01:42:05.253 --> 01:42:09.074]  So we're special as Americans, though we've turned into fat, dumb, and happy slobs.
[01:42:09.134 --> 01:42:10.755]  But tell me more about the Japanese.
[01:42:12.536 --> 01:42:18.659]  Yeah, well, it's funny you should mention genes, because really, they're only a few generations out of the Empire.
[01:42:19.119 --> 01:42:22.160]  So really, what you say is true.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:25.642]  They're so conditioned to accept authority.
[01:42:28.698 --> 01:42:38.870]  Uh, they got a new, they got a, you know, last time when I, not the last time, the time before when I called in I mentioned Koizumi, well he's gone now, and they have a new guy here called Abe, and the funny thing about him is...
[01:42:39.867 --> 01:42:41.908]  He's part of a long lineage.
[01:42:41.948 --> 01:42:43.468]  He's part of a political family.
[01:42:43.508 --> 01:42:46.069]  His grandfather was the Prime Minister here.
[01:42:46.569 --> 01:42:50.611]  And yet again, we've got that lineage creeping into government.
[01:42:51.411 --> 01:42:57.493]  It's like Kim Jong-il getting power from his daddy, or George Bush getting power from his daddy.
[01:42:57.834 --> 01:43:00.835]  You never want political dynasties.
[01:43:00.935 --> 01:43:02.835]  It stinks of despotism.
[01:43:02.875 --> 01:43:04.476]  You're on an IP phone, aren't you?
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.421]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
[01:43:06.561 --> 01:43:07.361]  No, it's okay.
[01:43:07.421 --> 01:43:08.782]  It's just breaking up sounds bad.
[01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:14.266]  But listen, that's why I always knock people who try to be different with hair sticking up.
[01:43:14.907 --> 01:43:15.988]  And I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:43:16.428 --> 01:43:19.731]  I always kind of knock people with their hair sticking up or tattoos all over them.
[01:43:20.071 --> 01:43:23.053]  Because I tell people in America, that's not being different.
[01:43:24.614 --> 01:43:26.275]  But I understand why they do it.
[01:43:26.335 --> 01:43:29.658]  They do it as an outward thing to say to all the sheep,
[01:43:30.439 --> 01:43:34.362]  And to say to all the people that are conforming, that hey, I am different.
[01:43:34.602 --> 01:43:36.043]  I'm different on the inside too.
[01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:37.984]  I understand running a flag up.
[01:43:38.424 --> 01:43:40.586]  I understand having blue spiked hair, okay?
[01:43:41.266 --> 01:43:43.708]  It's just for me, it's easier to have short hair.
[01:43:44.804 --> 01:43:46.265]  You know, that goes back to being a warrior.
[01:43:46.306 --> 01:43:47.967]  Somebody can't grab your hair and slit your throat.
[01:43:48.007 --> 01:43:49.609]  It goes back to not having lice in your hair.
[01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:51.150]  You know, I'm just a primitive.
[01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:53.573]  I like my hair short because I don't even comb it in the morning, folks.
[01:43:53.913 --> 01:43:58.278]  I just take the towel when it's wet and scrooch all it around and my hair, you know, just does what it does.
[01:43:58.578 --> 01:44:05.485]  And I throw on a simple t-shirt and a pair of jeans or I'm going out a pair of slacks and a shirt because it's simple and because it's camouflage.
[01:44:06.045 --> 01:44:07.626]  So the enemy doesn't see me.
[01:44:08.646 --> 01:44:16.290]  And they've hijacked the tattoo, blue hair movements, and the corporate structure has hijacked those and made it their own.
[01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:18.652]  Okay, or pink hair, or whatever.
[01:44:19.352 --> 01:44:25.135]  And so now they say, don't be rebellious against tyranny, don't be rebellious against oppression, just run around with green hair.
[01:44:26.395 --> 01:44:29.376]  And, uh, with a mohawk, and that will make you rebellious.
[01:44:29.436 --> 01:44:29.636]  No!
[01:44:30.036 --> 01:44:34.798]  I want to see the manifestation of shooting your mouth off in a shopping mall!
[01:44:35.198 --> 01:44:38.319]  I want to see you stand up to a cop when they try to bully you!
[01:44:38.559 --> 01:44:43.741]  I want to hear you put on the voice of power and say, how dare you try to violate my rights!
[01:44:43.981 --> 01:44:46.142]  How dare you treat me in this manner!
[01:44:46.722 --> 01:44:51.566]  You will follow my liberties to the T, or I assure you, you will be litigated against.
[01:44:51.826 --> 01:44:55.148]  And you may beat the rap, but you will not beat the ride.
[01:44:55.569 --> 01:44:55.789]  Is.
[01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.489]  That.
[01:44:56.970 --> 01:44:58.151]  Understood.
[01:44:58.511 --> 01:44:59.151]  Officer!
[01:44:59.632 --> 01:45:01.273]  That's what I want to hear from you!
[01:45:01.293 --> 01:45:02.874]  I want to hear power!
[01:45:03.315 --> 01:45:06.317]  I want to hear you stand up and be your natural selves!
[01:45:07.177 --> 01:45:09.419]  I want to hear you take this country back!
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.121]  I want to hear you be strong!
[01:45:13.442 --> 01:45:14.583]  Not a facsimile!
[01:45:14.663 --> 01:45:15.844]  Not a prosthesis!
[01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:20.532]  Not the illusion, not the vapor of the real thing.
[01:45:24.174 --> 01:45:33.479]  So again, I don't care if you got a shaved head, I don't care if you have 14 earrings in your nose, but you better be fighting the New World Order.
[01:45:33.519 --> 01:45:43.704]  You better, if you want to be rebellious, you want to rebel against this status quo, this corruption, everything we see, then I want to see real fruits.
[01:45:45.479 --> 01:45:48.501]  Not what you've been told is the trapping of being different.
[01:45:51.263 --> 01:45:54.946]  I don't want the semblance.
[01:45:55.166 --> 01:45:57.007]  I want the substance.
[01:45:57.087 --> 01:45:59.509]  And you should want the substance.
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:11.685]  Because I can have it any way I want, see, looking like a mainstream conservative person, because at heart I am a real conservative, but don't call me this modern term of conservative.
[01:46:11.885 --> 01:46:17.228]  And I like being able to have the cloaking device of looking like Mr. Rush Limbaugh worshipper.
[01:46:17.828 --> 01:46:20.049]  And then being able to switch it on, because it freaks them out.
[01:46:20.069 --> 01:46:21.449]  Everything's about how you look today.
[01:46:21.769 --> 01:46:26.730]  I like being able to switch it on and hit people who are in that phony conservative paradigm.
[01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:30.831]  Because, yeah, even with my looks, it then puts them off base.
[01:46:31.211 --> 01:46:37.373]  They expect me to have long hair and a ponytail, talk like this, enjoy his buzzes, do some bad thingies.
[01:46:37.633 --> 01:46:40.394]  And even those people take on that affected activity.
[01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:43.414]  And again, I don't care if you've got long hair, short hair.
[01:46:44.135 --> 01:46:45.395]  My point is I want reality.
[01:46:46.369 --> 01:46:48.769]  Joe in Wisconsin, if you like purple hair, do it.
[01:46:49.029 --> 01:46:49.730]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:52.010]  Ask again?
[01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:53.490]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.390]  Okay.
[01:46:55.551 --> 01:46:56.911]  Just for a comment for Edward.
[01:46:57.451 --> 01:47:06.132]  Me and Alex and I and everybody else is fighting for your right to disagree, but do you think if Karl Rove was a talk host, do you think he would give you first up status if you disagree?
[01:47:06.973 --> 01:47:15.614]  Anyway, what I wanted to talk about was the upcoming election, and I think I have a solution for things.
[01:47:16.092 --> 01:47:23.354]  This whole week, do nothing but find people in the red states, the ones that have these magic voting machines.
[01:47:23.834 --> 01:47:27.335]  Just tell them to go get an absentee ballot.
[01:47:27.635 --> 01:47:28.696]  Find ten people.
[01:47:29.216 --> 01:47:31.637]  Everybody, you know, states like Pennsylvania.
[01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:35.838]  Because that makes them like in Ohio, run off and get caught stealing the boxes.
[01:47:36.078 --> 01:47:36.378]  Oh yeah!
[01:47:36.458 --> 01:47:37.978]  At least we can physically bust them.
[01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:39.179]  Cops caught them a bunch of times.
[01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:43.040]  Well, I've got a website that shows where people have
[01:47:43.903 --> 01:47:50.646]  A paper trail, and which ones don't, it's www.verifiedvoting.org.
[01:47:51.586 --> 01:47:56.489]  And another good resource would be Bev Harris' blackboxvoting.org.
[01:47:56.789 --> 01:48:02.011]  Sure, and we've had her on a few weeks ago, but as the election approaches, I'm going to be doing a lot more on these electronic voting machines.
[01:48:02.091 --> 01:48:06.333]  Well, my point is, all of these Diebold executives are a bunch of felons.
[01:48:07.374 --> 01:48:07.855]  That's right!
[01:48:07.915 --> 01:48:17.966]  Again, Bush and his cronies have to hire criminals, whether it's ES&S or Diebold or the people that run the Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:48:18.287 --> 01:48:19.528]  They're always felons!
[01:48:19.748 --> 01:48:21.070]  They're open criminals!
[01:48:22.509 --> 01:48:23.690]  But Alex, think about this.
[01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:25.150]  We don't allow them to vote.
[01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:27.251]  Why are we allowing them to count ours?
[01:48:27.271 --> 01:48:29.933]  Oh my God, that is a great slogan!
[01:48:30.213 --> 01:48:36.596]  The voting machine companies are run almost unanimously by felons who can't vote, then why do they count them?
[01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:37.557]  Great point!
[01:48:37.977 --> 01:48:51.424]  But I think what we need to do is take that absentee ballot, fill it out, photocopy it twice, send it into a central collection agency, one that we can trust, keep one for ourselves, and then send the actual ballot in and have it checked.
[01:48:51.932 --> 01:48:52.933]  That's what we really need.
[01:48:53.253 --> 01:49:01.438]  This whole week, everybody... We need to just educate everybody that they're taking over and then, county by county, take out these systems, which is now starting to happen.
[01:49:01.838 --> 01:49:02.579]  First, they ignored us.
[01:49:02.599 --> 01:49:04.960]  Three years ago, we were like people with five heads.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.681]  Now, we are serious.
[01:49:06.741 --> 01:49:10.964]  Now, 90 plus percent, was it 95 percent in a major poll a few weeks ago?
[01:49:10.984 --> 01:49:15.827]  It was a group of polls in the high 90s, believe that the machines are frauds.
[01:49:16.227 --> 01:49:26.432]  You see, we're winning, we're winning, but they've still got the power and are ignoring us, so they know that as we all wake up, it's going to take just physical force to oppress us, but that always crumbles too.
[01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:28.133]  I mean, good to hear from you.
[01:49:29.394 --> 01:49:34.737]  And Joe, I'm sorry you got put at the back of the line for all these callers that are calling from foreign countries or disagree.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.204]  But, uh, we'll go to Paul and, uh, others.
[01:49:40.805 --> 01:49:43.568]  Paul and Brady and everybody else.
[01:49:44.109 --> 01:49:45.490]  Wide open phones in the third hour, too.
[01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:46.632]  The Limbaugh thing is coming up.
[01:49:47.052 --> 01:49:49.655]  The mystery of did Rush, uh, did Bush call me is coming up.
[01:49:49.695 --> 01:49:50.196]  It's all coming up.
[01:49:55.487 --> 01:50:00.969]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.329 --> 01:50:08.993]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.673 --> 01:50:16.716]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.116 --> 01:50:23.979]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:24.491 --> 01:50:28.552]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.852 --> 01:50:32.773]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.813 --> 01:50:34.733]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.073 --> 01:50:38.974]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.290 --> 01:50:54.131]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:50:54.472 --> 01:50:56.013]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:50:56.413 --> 01:50:56.653]  What?
[01:50:57.014 --> 01:50:57.374]  Again?
[01:50:57.794 --> 01:50:59.435]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:50:59.495 --> 01:51:03.919]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:51:04.159 --> 01:51:05.440]  Why did you do that?
[01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:11.444]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:51:11.744 --> 01:51:12.785]  Are we there yet?
[01:51:12.885 --> 01:51:13.946]  for the entire trip.
[01:51:14.186 --> 01:51:16.408]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:51:16.888 --> 01:51:17.909]  Great idea.
[01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:20.671]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:51:21.112 --> 01:51:23.577]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:51:23.778 --> 01:51:28.166]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:51:28.467 --> 01:51:28.768]  Honey!
[01:51:29.591 --> 01:51:30.832]  You're terrific!
[01:51:31.213 --> 01:51:32.714]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[01:51:32.814 --> 01:51:36.238]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:51:36.518 --> 01:51:37.299]  Now can we stop?
[01:51:37.799 --> 01:51:38.540]  I need to go, too.

[01:52:55.046 --> 01:53:01.071]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:01.671 --> 01:53:04.693]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:10.638 --> 01:53:15.802]  Alright, I'm going to go to Paul, Brad, Greg, Eric, and everybody.
[01:53:15.842 --> 01:53:17.243]  We're going to have open phones in the third hour.

[01:53:18.343 --> 01:53:24.248]  I will play the attack by the politically incorrect host now with his show on HBO against Charlie Sheen.
[01:53:24.986 --> 01:53:37.095]  We will also play a couple other clips and tell you who the mystery caller was that called and did the George Bush thing on my telephone.
[01:53:37.615 --> 01:53:38.436]  Was it George Bush?
[01:53:38.476 --> 01:53:39.516]  Was it a famous comedian?
[01:53:39.556 --> 01:53:39.957]  We'll see.
[01:53:40.957 --> 01:53:42.939]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:53:43.019 --> 01:53:44.460]  Paul in Canada, welcome!
[01:53:45.961 --> 01:53:47.482]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking the call.
[01:53:49.283 --> 01:53:52.145]  I have a couple quick questions for you.
[01:53:53.905 --> 01:54:03.954]  One of my questions is a tough question, but my first question is, do you know of the little owl on the up-verse side of the U.S.
[01:54:03.974 --> 01:54:04.474]  $1 bill?
[01:54:04.494 --> 01:54:09.959]  There's a little owl on the... Yes, it's right over by the 1, and they do all those fine etchings.
[01:54:09.979 --> 01:54:13.762]  There's keys and little eagles, and there is a little owl there, yes.
[01:54:14.582 --> 01:54:20.704]  Okay, and does that owl have anything to do with the 40 foot Bohemian Grove owl?
[01:54:21.285 --> 01:54:25.206]  Well yeah, I mean there are owls on the Supreme Court building, there's owls, a lot of corporate symbols.
[01:54:25.246 --> 01:54:27.807]  It's seen as a thing of wisdom and power, so yeah.
[01:54:28.607 --> 01:54:33.609]  Okay, my second question is Zionism.
[01:54:36.230 --> 01:54:40.392]  I kind of feel that, and a lot of people feel that, you don't target
[01:54:40.822 --> 01:54:41.983]  The Zionistic part of it.
[01:54:42.523 --> 01:54:49.348]  And in my mind, there's no doubt denying the fact that the NWO is headed by Zionists.
[01:54:50.289 --> 01:55:00.016]  And I'm just wondering, the protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, is that truly a hoax, like all these people say, oh it's such a hoax?
[01:55:00.457 --> 01:55:07.602]  You know, but when you go through it, and you look at the different tactics, like taking over media, banks, whatnot,
[01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:11.871]  It's hard to deny, but I just want to get your opinion.
[01:55:12.011 --> 01:55:12.492]  Is that a hoax?
[01:55:13.932 --> 01:55:14.732]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:55:14.932 --> 01:55:19.894]  It sounds like you disagree with me somehow, or this is a... No, no, let me stop you.
[01:55:20.214 --> 01:55:22.095]  If you would have said that, you would have gone to the head of the line.
[01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:24.776]  I just want you to know, sir, you're very coveted here.
[01:55:26.137 --> 01:55:28.357]  This is a... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:28.377 --> 01:55:29.438]  Let me just comment on it now.
[01:55:30.978 --> 01:55:35.320]  In the interest of getting to all the other callers, I'll never be able to cover all this news I've got coming up in the final hour.
[01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:49.174]  Number one, a lot of the people who have tried to bully me into attacking Jews are unsavory, lying snakes.
[01:55:50.474 --> 01:55:59.897]  So years ago, I noticed the people always talking about Zionists and Jews, they were the ones always telling lies about me, separately on other issues, and just
[01:56:00.572 --> 01:56:02.173]  Just incredibly hateful.
[01:56:02.674 --> 01:56:04.135]  Some were government agents, clearly.
[01:56:04.195 --> 01:56:05.236]  Some were just crazy.
[01:56:05.717 --> 01:56:07.818]  Some were just wildly jealous and hate-filled.
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:23.091]  And so right off the bat, you know, I was like, these are really... And of course, I'd grown up in Texas and worked and lived one year, part of the school year, in a summer, several summers in East Texas, and I ran into the Klan.
[01:56:23.852 --> 01:56:28.276]  And I mean, these were just incredibly trashy people, hateful of everyone around them.
[01:56:29.603 --> 01:56:33.487]  Uh, you know, my family helped found that area and they were calling, are you a damn Yankee?
[01:56:33.507 --> 01:56:42.776]  So, so I, so, you know, kind of out of the gates here, I don't really like the crowd that is, uh, always attacking Jews.
[01:56:42.836 --> 01:56:45.679]  And they'll always say, oh, we have a problem with Zionists.
[01:56:47.645 --> 01:56:52.047]  We have a problem with Zionists, which I've said no matter how many times I say, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:52.907 --> 01:56:54.588]  I'm against the Zionists.
[01:56:54.748 --> 01:56:55.989]  I don't like what the Zionists are doing.
[01:56:56.009 --> 01:57:01.671]  It's a very unsavory, very bad, mafiistic group who is manipulating our policy to a great extent, and I've said that.
[01:57:02.252 --> 01:57:10.335]  But the liars, the white trash, a lot of them are government agents, a lot of them are ADL, will, but then they get the white trash to parrot what they say.
[01:57:10.636 --> 01:57:11.456]  They know what they're doing.
[01:57:13.318 --> 01:57:19.343]  They always ignore the fact that I've covered all this stuff many, many times and had all these guests on.
[01:57:20.304 --> 01:57:21.025]  It doesn't matter.
[01:57:21.045 --> 01:57:22.586]  It doesn't matter.
[01:57:22.646 --> 01:57:23.467]  It isn't about that.
[01:57:23.487 --> 01:57:24.988]  It's about tearing down the movement.
[01:57:25.449 --> 01:57:27.210]  It's about not waking up to the New World Order.
[01:57:27.791 --> 01:57:30.373]  And it's about attacking Jews, which is going to kill this movement.
[01:57:32.635 --> 01:57:36.879]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.568 --> 01:57:49.228]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.869 --> 01:57:50.930]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:52.771]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.391 --> 01:57:54.212]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.972 --> 01:57:55.933]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.534 --> 01:58:00.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.716 --> 01:58:04.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.362 --> 01:58:16.882]  Welcome, my friends.
[01:58:16.922 --> 01:58:19.503]  We are now into our number three.
[01:58:19.563 --> 01:58:24.544]  Time flies when you're knocking the brains out of the New World Order.
[01:58:25.604 --> 01:58:28.024]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:28.724 --> 01:58:37.366]  In the next segment, I will, before we continue with calls, play the clip one last time, you might hear it six months from now, of this bizarre George Bush call.
[01:58:38.346 --> 01:58:43.147]  And I got the call Thursday afternoon, didn't learn of it until that morning on Friday.
[01:58:43.817 --> 01:58:46.418]  Did some checking and thought I knew who was doing it.
[01:58:47.298 --> 01:58:53.220]  Because it's the best, if it was an impersonation, the best Bush impersonation I'd ever heard.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.521]  And I knew it wasn't chopped up old speeches.
[01:58:57.741 --> 01:59:01.923]  Because you can tell the difference between the tonal quality, the audio, you know, the different microphone that was being used.
[01:59:02.143 --> 01:59:05.604]  When you work with audio, you get to where you recognize the stuff, like fingerprints.
[01:59:06.564 --> 01:59:11.626]  And it was somebody making an original call over a telephone, two telephone, had the whole telephone sound.
[01:59:13.306 --> 01:59:16.128]  And I made a prediction of what I thought it would be.
[01:59:16.148 --> 01:59:18.629]  And that's exactly what it was.
[01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:19.749]  It wasn't hard to guess.
[01:59:20.730 --> 01:59:21.770]  So we'll tell you.
[01:59:21.851 --> 01:59:23.912]  We will give you the mystery.
[01:59:26.393 --> 01:59:29.855]  We will spoil the fun on the other side of this break.
[01:59:29.875 --> 01:59:32.236]  And then I'll take a few more calls and get into Limbaugh tagging me.
[01:59:32.716 --> 01:59:33.396]  Analyze that.
[01:59:33.456 --> 01:59:36.138]  Get into Bush now changing his story on why we're in Iraq.
[01:59:37.378 --> 01:59:42.221]  They're saying that they may arrest the new Israeli president for rape.
[01:59:43.306 --> 01:59:45.268]  A lot of arm-twisting going on right now.
[01:59:45.768 --> 01:59:47.189]  There's infighting in all these groups.
[01:59:47.849 --> 01:59:58.917]  But unfortunately, good old Brad and others are going to have to hold on to the next segment because the last caller brought up such an important point, I have to address it and finish up with it.
[02:00:01.439 --> 02:00:12.107]  There are a lot of people who mockingbird what they hear others say in this movement, truth movement, patriot movement, some would call it another type of movement, but some of the people that are in it.
[02:00:13.012 --> 02:00:20.358]  But, just fill in the blank if you'd like, but I mean, I come from this from my center.
[02:00:20.678 --> 02:00:22.259]  I mean, I come from this from truth.
[02:00:22.399 --> 02:00:24.121]  I come from this as work.
[02:00:24.461 --> 02:00:25.722]  I come from this as a mission.
[02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:41.652]  And I've, you know, for ten years had people, I mean, I remember getting weird things where it was cutouts, like you see in the movies when somebody's got a ransom of different letters from magazines saying, the Goy Boy loves the Jews!
[02:00:42.073 --> 02:00:44.174]  The Goy Boy is going to die!
[02:00:45.595 --> 02:00:52.120]  And I was going, wow, these are incredible, and threats, and I wasn't even talking about Jews on my show.
[02:00:52.801 --> 02:00:55.163]  I was talking about the New World Order, and the Federal Reserve,
[02:00:56.886 --> 02:01:11.414]  That made them really upset, and so a lot of what the, you know, the ADL and the FBI, the ADL and others, you know, a rabbi got caught with the PO box of the Aryan Nations up in Idaho, and they'd have them out to protest every time they're about to pass hate laws to get them passed.
[02:01:12.135 --> 02:01:13.275]  I mean, it's fake, folks.
[02:01:13.335 --> 02:01:17.698]  Most of these groups are actually, actually run by the Mossad.
[02:01:18.898 --> 02:01:20.199]  And that's come out with a bunch of them.
[02:01:20.459 --> 02:01:21.900]  The American Hitler was Jewish.
[02:01:22.501 --> 02:01:23.701]  And I frankly am sick of it.
[02:01:24.022 --> 02:01:25.682]  I mean, think how great that works.
[02:01:25.762 --> 02:01:34.325]  Any political movement against tyranny or corruption, the media itself gives all these Nazi guys, all these TV shows, all this attention, all this program time.
[02:01:34.645 --> 02:01:35.605]  They won't give that to us.
[02:01:37.586 --> 02:01:42.227]  You see, because they want to beef up that threat, beef that up, and then attach to anything you're doing.
[02:01:42.407 --> 02:01:43.347]  Hey, I'm against corruption.
[02:01:43.788 --> 02:01:44.808]  Oh, you're anti-Jew.
[02:01:44.828 --> 02:01:46.788]  Hey, I'm for freedom.
[02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:48.269]  Oh, that's code for Jew.
[02:01:49.199 --> 02:01:50.761]  Uh, I'd like to not be in Iraq.
[02:01:50.821 --> 02:01:51.841]  Oh, you want to destroy Israel?
[02:01:51.881 --> 02:01:52.462]  You hate the Jews!
[02:01:52.782 --> 02:01:59.608]  I mean, I have, when the neocons call into this show or my other show, I do it on Sundays, they always say, you hate Israel, you Jew-hating piece of trash.
[02:01:59.628 --> 02:02:00.609]  I mean, I have recordings of them.
[02:02:01.049 --> 02:02:05.453]  One of them called yesterday, she wasn't as bad as the other guy, called a few weeks ago going, you Jew-hater!
[02:02:05.713 --> 02:02:06.994]  You're gonna get it, Jones!
[02:02:08.135 --> 02:02:11.498]  And on the other side of the equation, he, Jones, is secretly a Jew!
[02:02:11.978 --> 02:02:16.202]  Oh my gosh, he's, he's, and I, I just know that's a lie and ridiculous, and so what if I was?
[02:02:18.226 --> 02:02:19.347]  And so they know what they're doing.
[02:02:19.367 --> 02:02:26.690]  And then all the mockingbirds go out and attack whoever is doing a good job fighting the New World Order, going, He don't talk about the Jews!
[02:02:27.130 --> 02:02:28.751]  He don't talk about them!
[02:02:29.571 --> 02:02:30.252]  Look at him!
[02:02:30.312 --> 02:02:32.653]  We ought to get him and strike him up!
[02:02:33.153 --> 02:02:34.994]  He won't talk!
[02:02:36.195 --> 02:02:38.396]  Because I effectively expose Israel.
[02:02:38.836 --> 02:02:39.796]  I effectively!
[02:02:40.256 --> 02:02:41.357]  They hate it!
[02:02:41.817 --> 02:02:43.098]  So keep it coming, ADL!
[02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:47.821]  It's here!
[02:02:48.061 --> 02:02:52.804]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:53.184 --> 02:03:00.868]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.528 --> 02:03:08.592]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.992 --> 02:03:15.876]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:16.351 --> 02:03:20.412]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.712 --> 02:03:24.232]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.673 --> 02:03:26.573]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.933 --> 02:03:30.854]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:09.849 --> 02:04:16.416]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:04:16.656 --> 02:04:22.161]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:46.944]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:47.044 --> 02:04:49.425]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:04:49.485 --> 02:04:56.569]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[02:04:57.149 --> 02:04:59.450]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:03.632]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:04.192 --> 02:05:08.334]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:08.895 --> 02:05:11.856]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:12.839 --> 02:05:15.760]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:22.502]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:22.742 --> 02:05:25.583]  That's 1-888-892-6238.

[02:05:30.125 --> 02:05:30.405]  U.S.

[02:05:41.249 --> 02:05:42.209]  And ask for George.
[02:05:48.725 --> 02:05:49.365]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.026 --> 02:05:51.087]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:51.788 --> 02:05:52.929]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:53.569 --> 02:05:54.390]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.131 --> 02:05:55.992]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.693 --> 02:06:00.456]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.877 --> 02:06:04.941]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.638 --> 02:06:17.628]  Oh yeah, we for years have covered the fact that it's been in mainstream news, but we magnify it, that Israel admits they created fake Al-Qaeda groups and staged attacks against their own people.
[02:06:18.970 --> 02:06:20.251]  Absolutely documented.
[02:06:20.271 --> 02:06:23.074]  That should bring down our whole criminal government right there.
[02:06:25.231 --> 02:06:34.581]  But because we say, oh, the British government's evil too, and they did evil stuff long before, I guess, any Jews landed there, or the Chinese government's doing bad too, or North Korea, or our own government.
[02:06:35.121 --> 02:06:36.382]  Oh, no, that ain't it.
[02:06:36.462 --> 02:06:44.851]  It's the Jew, the devil spirit of the Jew, flies by with little bat wings and flies into the Chinaman to make him do it.
[02:06:45.999 --> 02:06:47.823]  I mean, literally, that's the attitude.
[02:06:48.204 --> 02:06:49.987]  No, we are not against Jews here.
[02:06:50.388 --> 02:06:51.250]  And we never will be.
[02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:55.478]  The people that claim, he covers up for the Zionisters.
[02:06:56.716 --> 02:06:58.777]  And then we've tracked back some of the groups attacking us.
[02:06:58.917 --> 02:07:00.298]  Clear ADL shills.
[02:07:00.358 --> 02:07:02.339]  They want to bully everybody into attacking Jews.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:03.900]  Zionists own documents.
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:08.143]  I mean, they published in major magazines 60, 70, 80 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:07:08.903 --> 02:07:17.969]  They're always saying that they want racism against Jews so that the Jews will get scared and go serve the Zionists who are a mafia who then use the Jews and feed off of them.
[02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:22.712]  Just like our government stages terror attacks and then gets us to go cuddle up under them.
[02:07:23.442 --> 02:07:25.904]  See, the Zionist groups will go get attacks on Jews.
[02:07:25.944 --> 02:07:33.448]  They were caught in some areas of Europe, and this is admitted, and in Iraq, staging bombings against Jews to make Jews move to the Holy Land.
[02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:46.817]  But see, if we address it from a point of not being racist, and from a point of talking about how there is a criminal mafia dominating the Jews, you see, that would actually bring them down.
[02:07:47.778 --> 02:07:48.438]  They don't want that.
[02:07:49.326 --> 02:07:56.247]  Because most of the crowd that attacks me, because I won't talk about the Zionists, when you really listen to them, it's Jew, Jew, Jew.
[02:07:56.267 --> 02:08:02.909]  I heard one of them this weekend on a show here on one of these networks, and it was just Jew, Jew, Jew.
[02:08:03.349 --> 02:08:04.889]  And it was going to be Jew at the end of it.
[02:08:04.949 --> 02:08:11.230]  Jews are evil, Jews are bad, Jews have evil genes, Jews are devils, Jews are going to get us.
[02:08:12.191 --> 02:08:14.311]  And even for folks that believe that,
[02:08:15.058 --> 02:08:22.623]  It is not going to be effective, and we're not going to defeat the New World Order by running around screaming that it's all the Jews.
[02:08:22.683 --> 02:08:26.265]  The public has been thoroughly inoculated and conditioned against that.
[02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:34.470]  Which is why then the very same elite come in and try to get everybody to attach to any freedom movement, anti-Semitism, so they can kill our movements.
[02:08:34.850 --> 02:08:36.811]  So no thank you, I won't take your cyanide pill.
[02:08:37.831 --> 02:08:38.332]  No, thank you.
[02:08:38.752 --> 02:08:40.273]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:08:40.513 --> 02:08:43.076]  I mean, let's just say that Jews run everything, which they don't.
[02:08:43.436 --> 02:08:46.539]  There are a lot of prominent Jews in powerful positions, though you cannot deny that.
[02:08:47.139 --> 02:08:51.503]  Let's just say that all the Jews disappeared and were teleported to Pluto.
[02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:52.804]  Okay?
[02:08:54.245 --> 02:09:05.415]  Evil WASPs and evil blacks, like Idi Amin, and evil Japanese, and evil people, power-hungry people, would step into those positions instantaneously.
[02:09:06.249 --> 02:09:09.512]  The Romans did horrible abuse of things long before the Jews were there.
[02:09:10.372 --> 02:09:11.973]  The Chinese and the Japanese did.
[02:09:12.494 --> 02:09:13.655]  It's not true.
[02:09:13.815 --> 02:09:16.837]  You know, Ivan the Terrible wasn't a Jew, folks, and he was a bad guy.
[02:09:18.258 --> 02:09:19.960]  Jeffrey Dahmer, did a Jew do it?
[02:09:21.901 --> 02:09:23.722]  John Wayne Gacy, did a Jew do it?
[02:09:24.103 --> 02:09:25.784]  You know, is evil the Jew?
[02:09:26.545 --> 02:09:28.606]  Is the source of all evil the Jew?
[02:09:29.087 --> 02:09:33.790]  Because until I put on a red armband with a swastika and start going, Zeke Heil!
[02:09:34.130 --> 02:09:34.851]  Zeke Heil!
[02:09:35.191 --> 02:09:35.872]  Zeke Heil!
[02:09:37.249 --> 02:09:45.336]  The parrots out there are going to say that I'm an evil Zionist agent who covers up the truth of the Jews.
[02:09:45.797 --> 02:09:48.059]  And of course they don't even know their masters are ADL.
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:57.767]  So there, sir, you called in with your comment, you called in with your point, and that's the end of it.
[02:09:57.947 --> 02:10:01.390]  Now I've got a caller here who's been holding for an hour, and normally I go to someone who disagrees first,
[02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:05.011]  But Brad's been holding out quite an hour, but close to it.
[02:10:05.151 --> 02:10:10.532]  When I go to calls, I'll go to Brad first, then we'll skip Greg, we'll go back to Greg, then Eric, but before that we've got to go to John.
[02:10:10.812 --> 02:10:13.113]  But we're not going to John right now because I promised to play this clip.
[02:10:14.833 --> 02:10:15.434]  Is it Bush?
[02:10:15.554 --> 02:10:16.454]  Is it an impersonator?
[02:10:16.534 --> 02:10:17.034]  What was it?
[02:10:17.074 --> 02:10:18.174]  Who called me last Thursday?
[02:10:18.434 --> 02:10:20.215]  We learned yesterday morning who it was.
[02:10:20.996 --> 02:10:27.678]  But before we do that, speaking of this whole Jewish thing, this is the type of call I get from neocon followers.
[02:10:27.738 --> 02:10:29.418]  And neocons are self-described.
[02:10:29.438 --> 02:10:31.359]  You know, Ron Paul's given speeches about them.
[02:10:31.639 --> 02:10:32.339]  Pat Buchanan.
[02:10:32.619 --> 02:10:34.259]  And I guess now they get called anti-Jew.
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:36.660]  Again, they attach it to everything.
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.341]  No, the neocons are self-described.
[02:10:38.761 --> 02:10:43.102]  Here is this lady, and I really answered her later, but I ended up hanging up on her.
[02:10:43.122 --> 02:10:43.842]  She wouldn't shut up.
[02:10:45.025 --> 02:10:46.767]  And there were so many things I wanted to talk to her about.
[02:10:46.787 --> 02:10:48.808]  I invited her on, though, to come on as a guest today.
[02:10:48.828 --> 02:10:49.388]  She refused.
[02:10:49.869 --> 02:10:54.172]  But this is yesterday on KLBJ syndicated through Genesis.
[02:10:54.872 --> 02:10:56.834]  Already picked up by five stations.
[02:10:56.854 --> 02:11:01.877]  We're asking your other affiliates to please pick it up or rebroadcast it later on Sunday nights, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:11:01.917 --> 02:11:02.138]  folks.
[02:11:02.158 --> 02:11:02.478]  Here it is.
[02:11:03.479 --> 02:11:05.160]  Cynthia, you're on KLBJ.
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:05.440]  Welcome.
[02:11:06.613 --> 02:11:30.939]  Hi Alex, I'm just curious what role you think the Muslim fascists and their oil pick financiers did have in 9-11, and what role Karl Rove and the neocons, which is a pejorative word for Jew last time I checked, what role they had in the beheadings of schoolgirls in Malaysia, and nuns over in Thailand, and all of that.
[02:11:30.959 --> 02:11:35.420]  And don't forget throwing babies out of incubators, which was proven to be a huge fraud.
[02:11:36.970 --> 02:11:37.431]  Throw that one?
[02:11:37.451 --> 02:11:42.098]  No, no, I mean, my point is ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, most of it is a lie.
[02:11:42.399 --> 02:11:44.222]  Now, now, let me just respond.
[02:11:44.242 --> 02:11:46.265]  The heading's a lie, I want to know.
[02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:48.048]  Okay, okay, I'm going to go back for just a second.
[02:11:49.168 --> 02:11:53.153]  We just sent my team down, and the video is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:53.173 --> 02:11:54.875]  I should play a clip of that, maybe next week I will.
[02:11:55.075 --> 02:12:03.785]  Just last week he confronted his Lordship, William Crystal, who was here in town, and he wrote a book, he coined the term Neocons.
[02:12:03.845 --> 02:12:07.249]  So, they call themselves Neocons,
[02:12:07.905 --> 02:12:17.249]  And they got upset then that people read their books and read their statements about the end of this country and the Straussians from the School of Economics there in Chicago.
[02:12:17.569 --> 02:12:21.350]  And they got very upset that real conservatives discovered them.
[02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:27.073]  And so Pat Buchanan and many other top Republicans have decried the neocons.
[02:12:27.133 --> 02:12:29.594]  So, out of the gate, you're claiming I'm anti-Semitic.
[02:12:29.634 --> 02:12:30.634]  Go ahead and just say it publicly.
[02:12:32.197 --> 02:12:34.683]  Go ahead, I'm not allowed to call them the name they call themselves.
[02:12:35.284 --> 02:12:38.351]  That's right, you're trying to neutralize my free speech.
[02:12:42.382 --> 02:12:47.404]  I'm a real conservative, and I know that Muslim fascists are cutting people's heads off.
[02:12:47.424 --> 02:12:47.924]  Sure they are.
[02:12:48.164 --> 02:12:49.364]  Hey, ma'am, let me just stop you.
[02:12:49.424 --> 02:12:50.945]  Nick Byrd, that was all staged.
[02:12:50.985 --> 02:12:57.166]  He was killed in combat operations for the Central Intelligence Agency, so they cut his head off and added a soundtrack to it.
[02:12:57.186 --> 02:12:59.707]  Alex, is there anything about this that you disagree with?
[02:12:59.747 --> 02:13:00.987]  You don't want any facts, do you, ma'am?
[02:13:01.007 --> 02:13:02.048]  You just want baloney, huh?
[02:13:03.866 --> 02:13:11.168]  No, no, I'm just curious if you're on the side of the Muslim fascists like that guy who's calling up... No, this is all you guys can ever say.
[02:13:11.568 --> 02:13:13.329]  This is all you guys can ever do.
[02:13:14.309 --> 02:13:20.231]  Okay, this is... Oh, now you're saying that guy that clearly had an American accent as a Muslim waiting to slit our throats?
[02:13:20.251 --> 02:13:24.012]  No, I'm talking about the guy with the Middle Eastern accent who is kissing your butt.
[02:13:26.027 --> 02:13:29.013]  Yeah, my producer in there just said there was no Middle Eastern accent.
[02:13:29.374 --> 02:13:32.260]  I bet the Muslims hide under your bed, don't they?
[02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:34.104]  Are you hearing their voices right now?
[02:13:34.144 --> 02:13:34.886]  Maybe in your fillings?
[02:13:36.729 --> 02:13:37.609]  Alex, you know what?
[02:13:37.769 --> 02:13:40.471]  I know they cut people's heads off, and they've been doing that.
[02:13:40.531 --> 02:13:40.972]  Yeah, I know.
[02:13:41.012 --> 02:13:42.433]  Cut heads off, cut heads off.
[02:13:42.453 --> 02:13:45.415]  If we don't give all our rights up and get rid of our borders, Al Qaeda will get us.
[02:13:45.455 --> 02:13:50.738]  I'm going to stop you right now, and I'll answer your questions, but I want you to answer my questions.
[02:13:51.279 --> 02:13:53.400]  Has Bush tripled the size of the BATF?
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:58.163]  Has he pushed an amnesty plan for total legalization of the illegal aliens?
[02:13:58.443 --> 02:13:59.964]  Has he signed on to UNESCO?
[02:14:00.205 --> 02:14:02.226]  Did he sign the North American Union Agreement?
[02:14:02.466 --> 02:14:04.928]  Has he spent more money than all presidents before him combined?
[02:14:05.618 --> 02:14:06.298]  Has he done that?
[02:14:06.499 --> 02:14:11.301]  I agree he has, but that doesn't mean... But he's in a fight against the Muslims!
[02:14:11.341 --> 02:14:14.783]  That's good, Alex, and that's where you're confused.
[02:14:14.844 --> 02:14:17.965]  Why is Lord Bush pumping in more Muslims than any other president?
[02:14:19.706 --> 02:14:21.467]  Well, I mean, that's wrong.
[02:14:21.487 --> 02:14:24.909]  Oh, I love him, he's so good!
[02:14:25.130 --> 02:14:29.292]  Our enemy, which is Islam and Muslim fascists.
[02:14:30.233 --> 02:14:31.373]  Ma'am, I'm telling you that
[02:14:33.590 --> 02:14:42.428]  The biggest threat is the New World Order syndicate that controls our government and much of our media.
[02:14:43.956 --> 02:14:46.719]  That's what I'm telling you, and I appreciate your call, because we're just out of time.
[02:14:46.739 --> 02:14:49.742]  You're welcome to try to call me next week, earlier in the show.
[02:14:49.762 --> 02:14:50.623]  We'll try to give you more time.
[02:14:50.843 --> 02:14:51.523]  I should have got her number.
[02:14:51.543 --> 02:14:54.766]  I should have her on my weekday show for like a full hour or something.
[02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:55.787]  In fact, call back, ma'am.
[02:14:55.807 --> 02:14:59.711]  Give me your number, and I'll have you on my syndicated show for 30, 40 minutes.
[02:14:59.731 --> 02:15:02.434]  There's so much music I could name you on for a whole hour, because I want it.
[02:15:02.474 --> 02:15:03.154]  She means well.
[02:15:03.194 --> 02:15:03.975]  This is a nice lady.
[02:15:04.716 --> 02:15:05.316]  I guarantee it.
[02:15:05.336 --> 02:15:07.638]  It'd be great to go over to her house, have dinner with her, go play golf.
[02:15:07.979 --> 02:15:09.240]  I mean, she's a nice person.
[02:15:09.887 --> 02:15:10.628]  But she didn't!
[02:15:11.028 --> 02:15:12.088]  Listen to me!
[02:15:12.749 --> 02:15:14.070]  Listen to me!
[02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:24.436]  You are meddling with the tidal forces of nature, Cynthia, and you will atone!
[02:15:24.456 --> 02:15:26.537]  Alright, that's a line from Network.
[02:15:27.198 --> 02:15:29.219]  Uh, Cynthia, you're not listening to me.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:34.262]  Al-Qaeda was hired for 45 million dollars.
[02:15:34.753 --> 02:15:36.454]  To attack the Serbs.
[02:15:36.874 --> 02:15:40.856]  That is a Republican Senate report chaired by Alphonse DiMotto, 1999.
[02:15:42.937 --> 02:15:43.397]  Cicero, 1999.
[02:15:44.497 --> 02:15:44.797]  Okay?
[02:15:45.158 --> 02:15:46.538]  What am I supposed to do for you?
[02:15:47.659 --> 02:15:51.120]  Al-Qaeda, the Russians didn't just attack Afghanistan.
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:16:00.404]  It's now declassified Operation Cyclone, our government, who had been breeding and training in Madrasas from Central Asia into the Middle East.
[02:16:00.905 --> 02:16:01.865]  From Lebanon.
[02:16:02.814 --> 02:16:13.004]  Okay, across the Euphrates, in Iraq, to as far east as Pakistan, had been training and funding only the most radical Muslims.
[02:16:13.384 --> 02:16:18.489]  And they would send them in with bombs and machine guns to take over all those countries.
[02:16:19.751 --> 02:16:21.512]  Do you understand that?
[02:16:22.193 --> 02:16:24.956]  So they've got three different types of terrorism.
[02:16:25.016 --> 02:16:25.877]  Provocateur,
[02:16:27.069 --> 02:16:31.312]  Real terrorism and total state-sponsored, where there are no Muslims involved.
[02:16:31.652 --> 02:16:34.554]  Spectacular events like 9-11 are pure state-sponsored.
[02:16:34.975 --> 02:16:35.615]  You understand me?
[02:16:36.696 --> 02:16:38.557]  Other events are provocateur.
[02:16:38.597 --> 02:16:45.822]  Even with a lot of suicide bombers, they don't know the money coming to them came from MI6, CIA, or Mossad.
[02:16:46.022 --> 02:16:49.845]  By the way, that's been in Arash, Jerusalem Post, UPI.
[02:16:49.905 --> 02:16:52.367]  You just don't know, do you?
[02:16:52.707 --> 02:16:54.388]  You don't understand that.
[02:16:55.603 --> 02:17:02.405]  You don't understand they make a hundred billion plus a year out of Iraq alone in extra hardware purchases.
[02:17:03.725 --> 02:17:06.006]  So they go and they create terrorist groups.
[02:17:06.606 --> 02:17:09.367]  And if they can't get a group to do it, they go do it themselves.
[02:17:09.707 --> 02:17:11.767]  Just like Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[02:17:12.287 --> 02:17:14.308]  Just like the USS Liberty was staged.
[02:17:14.568 --> 02:17:16.348]  Just like the Maine was staged.
[02:17:16.668 --> 02:17:21.430]  Just like Hitler staged terror attacks to launch World War II against Poland!
[02:17:23.681 --> 02:17:24.082]  I did it.
[02:17:24.122 --> 02:17:25.343]  I talked about Hitler.
[02:17:25.603 --> 02:17:27.525]  I'm in trouble now with some of the audience.
[02:17:28.266 --> 02:17:32.050]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[02:17:34.092 --> 02:17:35.693]  We'll play the Bush clip and tell you who did it.
[02:17:35.734 --> 02:17:40.258]  Then we'll go to Brad and then John and Greg and Eric and everybody else that's holding.
[02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:51.312]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:17:51.612 --> 02:17:56.914]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:17:57.314 --> 02:18:00.335]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:46.253]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[02:18:46.293 --> 02:18:47.654]  Today is October 13th, 2006.
[02:18:47.734 --> 02:18:49.897]  Gold opened at $5.87 and 1 oz gold coins can be purchased for $6.19.
[02:18:50.037 --> 02:18:51.399]  Again that's $6.19 to purchase 1 oz gold coins.
[02:18:56.693 --> 02:18:59.375]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[02:18:59.856 --> 02:19:04.480]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:06.301]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[02:19:06.721 --> 02:19:09.884]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[02:19:10.244 --> 02:19:15.709]  We, the people, labor to create the money only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[02:19:16.109 --> 02:19:21.774]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[02:19:22.174 --> 02:19:27.079]  Midas Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.282]  Call 800-686-2237.

[02:19:39.271 --> 02:19:39.592]  Call 1-800-686-2237.

[02:20:40.276 --> 02:20:41.278]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:44.984 --> 02:20:48.586]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:20:48.827 --> 02:20:49.687]  Look no further!
[02:20:49.987 --> 02:20:52.569]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:20:52.989 --> 02:21:01.515]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.

[02:21:03.476 --> 02:21:04.037]  I think so.
[02:21:19.175 --> 02:21:19.515]  I don't know.
[02:21:48.698 --> 02:21:50.198]  I was going to Brad, but he just hung up.
[02:21:50.479 --> 02:21:53.940]  So we'll go to John and Jason, who both disagree, and then we'll get to Greg and Eric.
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:54.520]  You guys stay there.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.880]  They've been holding long enough.
[02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:58.341]  I want to get to you.
[02:21:58.361 --> 02:21:59.441]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[02:21:59.921 --> 02:22:07.604]  Coming up in the next segment, too, after we take some calls, I'll play the clip of Limbaugh falsely attacking me, and analyze his propaganda, and then hit this Bush war news.
[02:22:08.084 --> 02:22:13.985]  Also, Oliver Stone says that his new film's going to be a thriller about trying to capture Bin Laden.
[02:22:14.205 --> 02:22:16.026]  This guy's totally gone over to the dark side.
[02:22:17.023 --> 02:22:18.684]  Maybe he was always there, who knows.
[02:22:19.445 --> 02:22:21.907]  Pretty bad stuff now, the second film to do this.
[02:22:23.108 --> 02:22:24.029]  Maybe he's just stupid.
[02:22:24.749 --> 02:22:25.590]  Although I doubt that.
[02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:29.193]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:22:30.334 --> 02:22:35.378]  I discovered who did this, and let's just play the clip.
[02:22:35.898 --> 02:22:38.040]  I got this call Thursday, wondered who it was.
[02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:40.082]  Friday, here it is.
[02:22:40.102 --> 02:22:42.344]  Mr. Jones, this is...
[02:22:43.868 --> 02:23:00.133]  This is George Bush, the President of the United States, and I've heard many things that you have been saying on the internet and other various mediums that are out there.
[02:23:00.173 --> 02:23:10.616]  I understand you have problems with the government and you believe in many conspiracies.
[02:23:11.772 --> 02:23:13.994]  But I believe that we can work this out.
[02:23:14.034 --> 02:23:20.559]  If you will take my phone call, we can speak about this stuff.
[02:23:20.579 --> 02:23:22.580]  We will work this out.
[02:23:24.041 --> 02:23:25.182]  It's diplomacy.
[02:23:25.242 --> 02:23:27.063]  Diplomatic diplomacy is the way to go.
[02:23:27.083 --> 02:23:39.092]  If the two of us can work this out, and I think we can, we will definitely have it worked out then.
[02:23:42.645 --> 02:23:43.365]  We'll try it back.
[02:23:44.466 --> 02:23:47.468]  If you need to keep doing what you're doing, do it.
[02:24:13.428 --> 02:24:15.009]  And yeah, it was Frank Caliendo.
[02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:21.913]  Folks were emailing him to his site and he said, yeah, I did do that on a radio show with Joe Rogan as a joke Thursday to Alex.
[02:24:22.733 --> 02:24:25.775]  And so I guess Joe was leaving it out there as a joke and wouldn't let me know who did it.
[02:24:26.376 --> 02:24:29.277]  But then we emailed him and confirmed it was Frank Caliendo.
[02:24:29.297 --> 02:24:30.998]  I think I'll try to get on the show.
[02:24:32.739 --> 02:24:33.160]  But I knew.
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:34.540]  I said it is not George Bush.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:37.642]  It is one of the top comedians out there.
[02:24:38.423 --> 02:24:39.823]  And it certainly was.
[02:24:40.264 --> 02:24:41.684]  And I knew it wasn't clips of a speech.
[02:24:41.704 --> 02:24:42.445]  It was just too good.
[02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:47.649]  Let's go ahead and... He's just been holding too long.
[02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:53.231]  I'm going to get to you, John and Jason, but Greg, or excuse me, George in Indiana has been holding too long.
[02:24:53.271 --> 02:24:53.591]  So has Eric.
[02:24:53.611 --> 02:24:56.172]  I'm going to get them out of the way, so we can give you guys plenty of time.
[02:24:56.432 --> 02:24:58.713]  Go ahead, you're on the air, George.
[02:24:58.993 --> 02:25:06.496]  Yeah, Alex, I got that movie, Demolitions, and about 49 minutes into the movie, it gives you a
[02:25:08.718 --> 02:25:18.386]  It shows you the ground zero where all these big beams have been cut at an angle and there's like eight of them on the screen.
[02:25:18.446 --> 02:25:24.931]  I've seen the one that was in your video, but I tell you this demolitions is as good as your terror storm is.
[02:25:25.672 --> 02:25:27.274]  Oh, I think it's excellent.
[02:25:27.554 --> 02:25:31.738]  That's why I've not gone up here and said Terror Storm is the best 9-11 film.
[02:25:32.218 --> 02:25:34.720]  It is the best government-sponsored terror film.
[02:25:35.641 --> 02:25:39.164]  It's good to micro-cause them in and just look at the demolitions to convince people.
[02:25:39.425 --> 02:25:44.549]  But then I always like to give the big view and show how it's been done in history, motive, why they do it, the big picture.
[02:25:44.970 --> 02:25:47.131]  I frankly found that to be extremely effective.
[02:25:47.172 --> 02:25:48.493]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[02:25:48.873 --> 02:25:52.036]  That's why I've made four different films on 9-11, written a book, published a book.
[02:25:53.251 --> 02:26:02.096]  That's why I carry a bunch of other videos that I think are the best out there, and we have 9-11 demolitions available on high-quality DVD right now, sir, and I'm glad you like it.
[02:26:02.636 --> 02:26:12.222]  And I tell you, I think your terror storm with this kind of lays out enough information a person would have to be crazy not to understand what's going on.
[02:26:12.802 --> 02:26:19.586]  I can't believe that there's not someone moving in government that's trying to overturn all of this.
[02:26:19.866 --> 02:26:20.747]  I mean, it's just like the
[02:26:21.383 --> 02:26:22.423]  They turned their back to it.
[02:26:22.683 --> 02:26:27.385]  Hey man, they live in million-dollar houses, big golf courses, cars, hot wives.
[02:26:27.925 --> 02:26:28.886]  That won't protect them.
[02:26:29.106 --> 02:26:29.626]  No, I know.
[02:26:29.646 --> 02:26:31.286]  They're just self-centered.
[02:26:31.326 --> 02:26:34.467]  It's all about the fancy suits and being yes men.
[02:26:35.028 --> 02:26:38.329]  Meanwhile, the country is literally being looted out from under us, sir.
[02:26:38.349 --> 02:26:39.469]  We're like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:26:39.849 --> 02:26:43.931]  Yeah, and you know, a friend that I've been talking to, trying to get him to wake up,
[02:26:45.658 --> 02:26:47.040]  He said, what difference does it make?
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:48.662]  I said, well, do you realize the Bill of Rights?
[02:26:48.722 --> 02:26:50.624]  He says, I don't even know what's on the Bill of Rights.
[02:26:50.704 --> 02:26:52.506]  I said, well, you deserve what you're going to get then.
[02:26:52.826 --> 02:26:59.995]  And he has no idea that we're fighting tooth and nail for him, that if we weren't here, his pension fund, his bank account, his property, it'd all be gone.
[02:27:00.175 --> 02:27:01.937]  That's the nature of government in history.
[02:27:01.977 --> 02:27:03.839]  It isn't that it happens sometimes.
[02:27:03.979 --> 02:27:05.681]  It always happens.
[02:27:05.941 --> 02:27:06.182]  Yeah.
[02:27:06.642 --> 02:27:08.363]  Well, I don't know how to convince him otherwise.
[02:27:08.423 --> 02:27:09.883]  I've pretty much given up on it.
[02:27:10.563 --> 02:27:12.304]  Give him a copy of Demolitions.
[02:27:12.324 --> 02:27:13.464]  Give him a copy of Terror Storm.
[02:27:13.904 --> 02:27:15.365]  And if he says he doesn't care, move on.
[02:27:15.525 --> 02:27:16.345]  Dust your feet off.
[02:27:16.645 --> 02:27:17.746]  Let the dead bury the dead.
[02:27:17.786 --> 02:27:19.426]  Pearls before swine and everything else.
[02:27:20.247 --> 02:27:20.767]  Take care, man.
[02:27:20.787 --> 02:27:21.647]  Good to hear from you, George.
[02:27:22.267 --> 02:27:24.608]  Okay, briefly, because, I mean, I've got a bunch of stuff to do now.
[02:27:24.748 --> 02:27:30.670]  I'm going to let Eric, who's been gracious to hold, and look at the John and Jason, who disagree, a bundle of them.
[02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:37.434]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.355 --> 02:27:41.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:45.805 --> 02:29:49.928]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:50.148 --> 02:29:51.909]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:52.189 --> 02:29:58.473]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:29:58.754 --> 02:30:04.878]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.138 --> 02:30:06.979]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:07.119 --> 02:30:13.064]  uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.

[02:30:34.519 --> 02:30:34.620]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:37.861]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:37.881 --> 02:30:44.984]  Alright, I'm just taking three more calls because I got three clips I want to play and some more news.
[02:30:57.546 --> 02:30:59.387]  This third hour is the one nobody should miss.
[02:30:59.407 --> 02:31:00.508]  It's always the most jam-packed.
[02:31:01.108 --> 02:31:02.309]  Eric in Connecticut, go ahead.
[02:31:02.349 --> 02:31:02.890]  You're on the air.
[02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:03.590]  Thanks for calling.
[02:31:04.391 --> 02:31:05.852]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:31:06.132 --> 02:31:07.433]  Greetings from Skull and Bones country.
[02:31:07.673 --> 02:31:07.993]  Yes.
[02:31:08.914 --> 02:31:10.395]  I hit one out of the park last Friday.
[02:31:10.415 --> 02:31:12.836]  Can I read you a short letter that I had published in my newspaper?
[02:31:12.956 --> 02:31:13.577]  Sure, tell us.
[02:31:14.017 --> 02:31:15.178]  Okay, to the editor of the day.
[02:31:15.638 --> 02:31:20.101]  Thomas Jefferson said that an informed populace is essential to liberty.
[02:31:20.702 --> 02:31:25.285]  He would be appalled at the pre-digested candy that passes for mainstream news today.
[02:31:26.187 --> 02:31:29.129]  I'm convinced that we Americans are the most lied to people on earth.
[02:31:29.829 --> 02:31:35.592]  We have been woefully short sheeted by our leaders in government and media and are frankly a laughingstock.
[02:31:36.592 --> 02:31:44.016]  Agenda driven reporting born of subterfuge has camouflaged accurate accounts of the sordid history of government-sponsored terrorism for example.
[02:31:44.757 --> 02:31:48.619]  How many Americans have heard of operations Northwoods, Ajax and Gladio?
[02:31:49.179 --> 02:31:55.122]  Go to www.infowars.com or google video to watch Alex Jones' latest film, Terror Storm.
[02:31:55.822 --> 02:32:02.107]  It concisely and clearly exposes the techniques of the problem-reaction solution engaged in by governments, including our own.
[02:32:02.948 --> 02:32:10.274]  A recent poll indicated that most Americans were more familiar with the character of the TV series The Simpsons than the First Amendment of our Constitution.
[02:32:10.875 --> 02:32:17.341]  Have our priorities morphed from the concern for the well-being of our nation to cold six-packs, football, and the latest installment of American Idol?
[02:32:18.421 --> 02:32:23.546]  Bread and circuses was an effective tool for diverting the masses during Roman times.
[02:32:24.192 --> 02:32:27.156]  The electronic version of the aforementioned is alive and well today.
[02:32:27.897 --> 02:32:35.127]  Our very survival as a nation depends on our getting and staying informed and involved regarding the actions and policies of our elected public servants.
[02:32:35.608 --> 02:32:37.270]  We the people get the government we deserve.
[02:32:37.791 --> 02:32:38.392]  Thanks a lot, Alex!
[02:32:39.403 --> 02:32:41.044]  Hey, you're not gone, are you, Eric?
[02:32:41.244 --> 02:32:41.444]  No.
[02:32:41.784 --> 02:32:44.765]  I just want to thank you, because that's another great idea.
[02:32:44.785 --> 02:32:57.189]  You know, whereas the Pentagon spends millions for fake letters to the editor, what would happen if all the listeners wrote letters to the editor like that, with some information, and said, go to the video and watch Terror Storm for proof of this?
[02:32:58.158 --> 02:33:06.101]  I mean, that would get millions of viewers right there, and we're trying to get this out, so thank you, thank you, thank you for listening to my call to arms.
[02:33:06.461 --> 02:33:09.142]  When did you write that letter, and how long did it take for him to publish it?
[02:33:09.442 --> 02:33:10.123]  About three days.
[02:33:10.323 --> 02:33:15.164]  I called the day, and I asked the lady, I said, you know, please make sure, the lady there, very good.
[02:33:15.725 --> 02:33:19.786]  I said, please make sure the reference to Alex Jones and his video gets in that article.
[02:33:19.866 --> 02:33:23.408]  I said, that is the key, that's the crux of the letter.
[02:33:23.448 --> 02:33:24.228]  And she said, okay.
[02:33:25.695 --> 02:33:27.596]  And then you followed it up with a phone call.
[02:33:27.656 --> 02:33:33.521]  I mean, you put that seed in the ground, you put a little water on it, you know, and look now, it really grew.
[02:33:33.981 --> 02:33:37.223]  And I would imagine, you know, thousands of people will read that in your paper.
[02:33:37.624 --> 02:33:39.765]  The stakes are too high, Alex, for us to let this go.
[02:33:40.265 --> 02:33:41.046]  What was the paper?
[02:33:41.086 --> 02:33:45.249]  I'll put a link to the letter to the editor as a way to give people an example of what to do.
[02:33:45.569 --> 02:33:49.972]  Okay, it's The Day, www.theday.com.
[02:33:50.012 --> 02:33:52.034]  It's the new one, Connecticut Day.
[02:33:52.214 --> 02:33:53.495]  Oh boy, yeah, that's the big paper.
[02:33:53.860 --> 02:33:56.943]  Okay, and it might be, I think after a couple of days you've got to register.
[02:33:56.963 --> 02:33:59.425]  It's just your name and your email address.
[02:33:59.725 --> 02:34:00.105]  Yeah, sure.
[02:34:00.125 --> 02:34:03.908]  We'll go grab it off the online version today before they make you register.
[02:34:04.129 --> 02:34:04.689]  Thank you.
[02:34:04.869 --> 02:34:05.209]  Sure.
[02:34:05.450 --> 02:34:06.651]  Can I have one quick thing?
[02:34:06.671 --> 02:34:06.871]  Sure.
[02:34:07.331 --> 02:34:08.752]  I was riding my bicycle in town, right?
[02:34:08.772 --> 02:34:10.894]  There's a children's museum in town here in Niantic.
[02:34:11.354 --> 02:34:13.316]  I saw a Kinder Care van.
[02:34:14.077 --> 02:34:15.598]  I almost fell off my bicycle.
[02:34:16.218 --> 02:34:20.502]  The Kinder Care logo has the pyramid with the missing capstone in the eye of Ra.
[02:34:21.143 --> 02:34:22.744]  Could you tell me what that has to do with kids?
[02:34:24.011 --> 02:34:24.912]  It's just sick.
[02:34:24.992 --> 02:34:28.095]  It's a cult that runs things, and they put their thing everywhere.
[02:34:28.135 --> 02:34:28.795]  It's a big joke.
[02:34:28.815 --> 02:34:31.417]  They need to get power out of having it in plain view.
[02:34:31.457 --> 02:34:32.278]  Thank you for the call.
[02:34:33.039 --> 02:34:33.599]  God bless you.
[02:34:33.619 --> 02:34:34.560]  That is really exciting.
[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:36.361]  Thank you so much, Eric, and thanks for holding.
[02:34:36.862 --> 02:34:37.282]  All right.
[02:34:37.462 --> 02:34:47.250]  I have no idea what they disagree with, but they disagree, so we are going to skip some other callers and tell them, sorry, we don't have time to go to your calls, but John and Jason disagree, so we have time to take theirs, even though we really don't.
[02:34:47.691 --> 02:34:48.952]  John in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.350]  Hello?
[02:34:52.570 --> 02:34:52.831]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:53.051 --> 02:34:53.451]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:34:53.691 --> 02:34:54.072]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:34:54.092 --> 02:34:55.032]  I heard a click or something.
[02:34:55.513 --> 02:34:56.173]  Yeah, it does that.
[02:34:56.213 --> 02:34:59.916]  That's the standard Telos phone system to let you know you're on air.
[02:34:59.936 --> 02:35:01.498]  It goes... Okay.
[02:35:01.578 --> 02:35:02.819]  Well, thank you for taking my call.
[02:35:02.899 --> 02:35:06.502]  Actually, that's the aliens uploading your brain, but I'm sorry.
[02:35:06.542 --> 02:35:06.822]  Go ahead.
[02:35:06.862 --> 02:35:07.383]  One or the other.
[02:35:09.024 --> 02:35:11.366]  And same old, same old with me about disagreeing.
[02:35:11.566 --> 02:35:13.648]  I'm here to contend your assertion that
[02:35:14.718 --> 02:35:18.719]  The Bible is all about standing up and resisting and standing up for our rights against evil.
[02:35:19.139 --> 02:35:20.700]  If I could just read a few short passages.
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:21.860]  Well, let me just stop you.
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:24.581]  Was Paul in prison for not following government orders?
[02:35:24.941 --> 02:35:26.462]  I'm here to read a passage from the Bible.
[02:35:26.542 --> 02:35:26.942]  You know what?
[02:35:26.982 --> 02:35:27.682]  Put him on hold.
[02:35:27.742 --> 02:35:28.342]  Put him on hold.
[02:35:28.663 --> 02:35:32.764]  Because it's one thing if somebody calls repeatedly with the same bull.
[02:35:33.769 --> 02:35:35.891]  Okay, we've had scholars, we've had pastors on.
[02:35:35.911 --> 02:35:42.675]  The whole Bible is about standing up against the corrupt state, standing up against the corrupt king, saying no to the king of Egypt.
[02:35:44.016 --> 02:35:45.697]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[02:35:45.777 --> 02:35:49.380]  Christ went and overturned the money changers, the leaders of the church whipped them.
[02:35:50.420 --> 02:35:57.705]  Now, if you have a godly government, in very rare cases it's saying follow that, or follow the laws, you know, don't murder, things like that.
[02:35:58.426 --> 02:35:58.926]  But you know what?
[02:35:58.966 --> 02:36:00.087]  I'm going to give you 60 seconds.
[02:36:00.127 --> 02:36:00.507]  Go ahead.
[02:36:00.527 --> 02:36:01.228]  Just give them the floor.
[02:36:02.097 --> 02:36:03.858]  Alright, I'm calling about lawsuits.
[02:36:03.878 --> 02:36:09.321]  You mentioned alleged civil litigation, which is something that I have engaged in against the New World Order myself.
[02:36:09.361 --> 02:36:13.042]  This passage concerns pagan governments and bringing civil lawsuits before them.
[02:36:13.403 --> 02:36:16.564]  Paul is the author of Corinthians, or the commonly attributed author.
[02:36:16.584 --> 02:36:20.306]  1 Corinthians 6, verses 4-8.
[02:36:21.086 --> 02:36:27.229]  If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge?
[02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:28.850]  I say this to your shame.
[02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:30.591]  It is so that there is
[02:36:31.221 --> 02:36:37.345]  Is it so that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?
[02:36:37.785 --> 02:36:41.208]  But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers.
[02:36:41.588 --> 02:36:45.991]  Now, therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another.
[02:36:46.291 --> 02:36:47.892]  Why do you not rather accept wrong?
[02:36:48.172 --> 02:36:50.253]  Why do you not rather let yourselves be cheated?
[02:36:50.634 --> 02:36:54.416]  No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you do these things to your brethren.
[02:36:54.636 --> 02:36:56.377]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex, and God bless you.
[02:36:56.417 --> 02:36:57.578]  That proves nothing, sir.
[02:36:57.598 --> 02:36:58.839]  You're an absolute... and that's a joke!
[02:36:59.699 --> 02:37:01.520]  You just read off some passages?
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:15.846]  Are you telling me that the body of the Bible, Old and New Testament, is not one story after the next, historical stories of people standing up against evil, telling the king, no, I'm not going to bow down before you.
[02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:17.187]  Fine, you go in the lion's den.
[02:37:17.547 --> 02:37:19.068]  No, I'm not going to bow down before you.
[02:37:19.128 --> 02:37:20.368]  Fine, you go in the furnace.
[02:37:20.788 --> 02:37:22.849]  No, I'm not going to worship your Caesar.
[02:37:23.089 --> 02:37:24.310]  I'm going to cut your head off.
[02:37:25.356 --> 02:37:25.696]  Pardon me?
[02:37:25.896 --> 02:37:27.558]  What do you think about David and Saul?
[02:37:27.958 --> 02:37:35.323]  I remind you, David... Saul tried to kill David multiple times, and David forgave him, and subserviated himself to Saul multiple times.
[02:37:35.363 --> 02:37:38.665]  Again, sir, you're taking things out of context.
[02:37:38.685 --> 02:37:40.227]  I'm believing in the Bible, Alex.
[02:37:40.367 --> 02:37:42.408]  No, actually, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:37:43.109 --> 02:37:44.750]  Fine, lay down the corruption, man!
[02:37:44.770 --> 02:37:47.852]  Hey, when the CPS comes to take your kids, let them take them!
[02:37:48.607 --> 02:37:49.468]  Don't even sue them!
[02:37:49.508 --> 02:37:50.888]  Don't even leave your house!
[02:37:51.329 --> 02:37:55.471]  Just like a chicken-necked little... This is what cursed America.
[02:37:56.111 --> 02:38:04.836]  We've gone from the Founding Fathers and the Black Brigades, the pastors and priests, leading us into war against King George III, to that that you just heard.
[02:38:05.696 --> 02:38:11.400]  We have gone from the people in the B-17s over Germany and the paratroopers, to that.
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:14.081]  To that that you just heard, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:14.421 --> 02:38:17.323]  That's the type of coward who sits there.
[02:38:18.544 --> 02:38:21.528]  God cursed Israel with a king because they asked for one.
[02:38:22.409 --> 02:38:22.689]  Okay?
[02:38:22.729 --> 02:38:24.671]  And God does different things at different times.
[02:38:24.712 --> 02:38:31.740]  There is a time to reap, a time to sow, a time to die, a time to dance, a time to sing, a time to go to war, a time for peace.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:35.104]  You have to read the whole thing in its whole context, you twit!
[02:38:35.464 --> 02:38:36.706]  You miserable coward!
[02:38:37.498 --> 02:38:42.000]  The entire Bible is about standing up against evil and standing up against the government.
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:44.161]  And you never respond to anything I raise.
[02:38:44.682 --> 02:38:45.902]  Hundreds of stories in the Bible.
[02:38:45.922 --> 02:38:50.185]  You just twist and... You're a little... You're a pig, demons, what you are.
[02:38:50.905 --> 02:38:51.545]  Little pig.
[02:38:51.565 --> 02:38:53.686]  Don't even... I shouldn't get mad.
[02:38:54.347 --> 02:38:54.627]  Fine.
[02:38:54.827 --> 02:38:54.987]  Fine.
[02:38:55.307 --> 02:38:56.568]  Let's lay down, folks.
[02:38:56.608 --> 02:38:58.149]  That's exactly what we're supposed to do.
[02:38:59.129 --> 02:39:00.670]  That's exactly what we're supposed to do.
[02:39:01.690 --> 02:39:02.451]  Over and over again.
[02:39:02.491 --> 02:39:04.512]  Who will watch?
[02:39:04.532 --> 02:39:06.574]  Who will stand up against the wicked ones for me?
[02:39:07.034 --> 02:39:08.295]  Who will be a watchman on the wall?
[02:39:08.335 --> 02:39:12.298]  If you're not a watchman on the wall, you see the enemy coming, you don't warn the people, the blood is on your hands.
[02:39:12.719 --> 02:39:15.981]  Better for you to let one of these children harm one of these little children, tie a millstone around your neck.
[02:39:16.662 --> 02:39:18.143]  On and on and on.
[02:39:18.423 --> 02:39:20.024]  And Christ saying no to the government.
[02:39:20.364 --> 02:39:22.686]  I mean, crucified for it, but not you, buddy.
[02:39:24.307 --> 02:39:25.749]  I know, just take the easy way.
[02:39:25.769 --> 02:39:28.691]  I'm just gonna sit here and go along with everything.
[02:39:31.773 --> 02:39:33.254]  Will I even have time for Limbaugh now?
[02:39:33.655 --> 02:39:35.616]  The last caller disagrees and it's got to be quicker.
[02:39:35.636 --> 02:39:36.897]  Jason in Texas, go ahead.
[02:39:36.917 --> 02:39:39.118]  Hey Alex.
[02:39:39.379 --> 02:39:41.060]  Hello Jason, you disagree, go ahead.
[02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:43.742]  Well, I talked to you once about Fnord before.
[02:39:44.002 --> 02:39:46.604]  You said that everybody knows about it, but I know that not everybody knows about it.
[02:39:46.624 --> 02:39:47.044]  You talked about what?
[02:39:47.064 --> 02:39:47.925]  I didn't understand you.
[02:39:48.125 --> 02:39:48.485]  Fnord.
[02:39:48.745 --> 02:39:49.986]  F-N-O-R-D.
[02:39:50.546 --> 02:39:52.328]  To show my ignorance, what is Fnord?
[02:39:53.108 --> 02:39:56.791]  It's pretty much like the old saying, but it's amorphous.
[02:39:57.191 --> 02:40:01.194]  They use different... Oh yeah, you called a TV show and I didn't understand a word you said.
[02:40:03.309 --> 02:40:05.350]  You see the secret signs?
[02:40:05.430 --> 02:40:07.812]  It's a little egg inside the eye of the pyramid?
[02:40:08.072 --> 02:40:10.033]  Yeah, I understand those symbols are everywhere.
[02:40:10.053 --> 02:40:10.874]  We just talked about it.
[02:40:11.234 --> 02:40:13.656]  And then you said that I'm not talking about it.
[02:40:13.676 --> 02:40:14.617]  Well, what are you talking about?
[02:40:14.797 --> 02:40:20.641]  I'd like to have it covered more because of how pervasive it is and how it's forming our faces all the time.
[02:40:20.721 --> 02:40:22.102]  And people don't realize what it is.
[02:40:22.682 --> 02:40:28.126]  And that's the only point that I was bringing up that you disagreed about, that I disagreed about, was that you said everybody knows about it.
[02:40:28.146 --> 02:40:29.166]  Not everybody knows about that.
[02:40:29.667 --> 02:40:31.248]  They know about like a capstone pyramid.
[02:40:31.707 --> 02:40:34.468]  And they see that every now and then, but there's so much more to it.
[02:40:34.648 --> 02:40:36.529]  I mean, I'd like to talk to you later about it.
[02:40:36.549 --> 02:40:37.530]  It's a gang sign.
[02:40:37.570 --> 02:40:38.290]  It's their symbol.
[02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:39.451]  But they own this.
[02:40:39.471 --> 02:40:40.531]  So, what's your point?
[02:40:40.551 --> 02:40:44.934]  They're pretty much like creating a, you know, the Mark of the Beast or whatever is what this is pretty much.
[02:40:44.994 --> 02:40:45.314]  Okay.
[02:40:45.614 --> 02:40:47.815]  I'm going to have to let you go in about 30 seconds.
[02:40:47.855 --> 02:40:48.575]  What's your next point?
[02:40:49.336 --> 02:40:51.417]  The next thing is the flag of Iran.
[02:40:51.437 --> 02:40:56.379]  If you look at it and compare it to the head of the Baphomet, it's like the same thing or whatever.
[02:40:56.679 --> 02:40:57.780]  So, I don't know from what that's worth.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:40:58.861]  You better nuke them then.
[02:40:59.481 --> 02:40:59.581]  No.
[02:41:00.273 --> 02:41:01.133]  No, I don't agree with that.
[02:41:01.294 --> 02:41:02.894]  I mean, I agree with everything about you.
[02:41:02.914 --> 02:41:03.755]  I think you're great, man.
[02:41:03.795 --> 02:41:04.435]  I totally love you.
[02:41:04.976 --> 02:41:05.536]  For real, man.
[02:41:05.576 --> 02:41:06.496]  You're totally awesome.
[02:41:06.516 --> 02:41:09.098]  If there was more people like you, we wouldn't even be in this situation.
[02:41:09.358 --> 02:41:09.958]  Well, please.
[02:41:09.998 --> 02:41:11.039]  I'm just an average person.
[02:41:11.319 --> 02:41:12.720]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:15.481]  And we should get more into numerology and the symbols.
[02:41:15.721 --> 02:41:17.102]  It's the globalist gang sign.
[02:41:17.122 --> 02:41:18.022]  They tag everything.
[02:41:18.062 --> 02:41:19.583]  Like, low-level gang members.
[02:41:19.623 --> 02:41:21.144]  Everything they do, the globalists do.
[02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:21.884]  It's all the same.
[02:41:22.385 --> 02:41:23.725]  It's a dirty gang of pirates.
[02:41:24.786 --> 02:41:25.086]  Okay.
[02:41:26.267 --> 02:41:26.507]  Okay.
[02:41:27.566 --> 02:41:37.809]  They tag things with all seeing eyes, with a little triple six egg you were mentioning, with owls, with pirate symbols, I mean... Okay, I wanted to get into O'Reilly, too.
[02:41:37.889 --> 02:41:43.730]  Cue at the last minute of O'Reilly when he says he's gonna, you know, call the FBI and he needs to be investigated.
[02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:47.711]  I mean, this is really scary, but we'll play that after the Limbaugh clip.
[02:41:49.612 --> 02:41:54.493]  Limbaugh engaged in massive spin Thursday, the day after the plane crash.
[02:41:55.932 --> 02:41:58.115]  He went on for like an hour, we're just going to play two minutes of it.
[02:41:59.136 --> 02:42:12.169]  And we reported, and we said in the article, which you can go read, which he then read, that Fox News was engaging in a PSYOP claiming that it would affect the election and conjure images of 9-11, which we said it clearly did.
[02:42:13.886 --> 02:42:19.450]  And in the hour before, Limbaugh indeed says that, says it's conjuring 9-11, it can be used politically.
[02:42:19.851 --> 02:42:30.138]  But then he double-spins it back, takes our article reporting on Fox using it as a psy-op and claims we're nuts, believing the plane crashing into the building itself is a psy-op.
[02:42:31.499 --> 02:42:37.424]  So we're reporting on their propaganda, and as a propagandist, he turns it around and claims that we reported that.
[02:42:37.884 --> 02:42:38.765]  Here's Rush Limbaugh.
[02:42:39.798 --> 02:42:43.921]  Ladies and gentlemen, during the break, a friend of mine sent me an email.
[02:42:44.801 --> 02:42:48.404]  I don't visit the Democrat kook websites much anymore, but a friend does.
[02:42:52.686 --> 02:42:53.447]  It's just funny.
[02:42:55.108 --> 02:42:55.908]  What is this site?
[02:42:56.909 --> 02:42:58.870]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:59.931 --> 02:43:01.892]  It's an article here by Alex Jones.
[02:43:02.653 --> 02:43:04.834]  Now, I'm told, I don't know this for certain,
[02:43:07.228 --> 02:43:14.031]  I'm told that Alex Jones is one of the leaders of the 9-11 was a government conspiracy campaign.
[02:43:14.351 --> 02:43:21.874]  One of the leaders of the movement trying to prove that 9-11 was not what it was, that the Bush administration was behind it for whatever nefarious purpose.
[02:43:21.894 --> 02:43:22.855]  Let me just read this to you.
[02:43:24.675 --> 02:43:28.537]  Headline, Fox News spins plane accident says it could affect election.
[02:43:29.218 --> 02:43:35.564]  The FBI and Homeland Security are now labeling a small aircraft hitting an apartment building in Manhattan as a probable accident.
[02:43:35.744 --> 02:43:42.149]  Is this a government psyop intended to invoke memories of 9-11 as the midterm elections approach?
[02:43:42.930 --> 02:43:45.092]  On Fox News, your world with Neil Cavuto.
[02:43:45.132 --> 02:43:53.699]  Cavuto suggested during a conversation with Congressman Peter King that the event would possibly affect the upcoming midterm election by reminding Americans of the horror of 9-11.
[02:43:55.097 --> 02:43:59.681]  It has now been reported the pilot, one of the occupants of the plane, was Corey Lytle.
[02:44:00.382 --> 02:44:03.024]  The fact that the accident... Now listen to this.
[02:44:03.865 --> 02:44:14.974]  The fact that the accident involves a celebrity means the networks can justifiably talk about it for another three weeks, and in that sense, invoking memories of 9-11, it could impact the election.
[02:44:15.524 --> 02:44:30.274]  Reports that Lytle's passport was found on the street, also seen as suspicious by some 9-11 truthers, because it would seemingly prop up the inconceivable notion that Mohammed Atta and other hijackers' passports survived and were discovered.
[02:44:30.314 --> 02:44:38.520]  However, in the case of Lytle, this could easily be explained by eyewitness reports that most of the plane debris did not enter the building and ended up on the street below.
[02:44:40.709 --> 02:44:41.370]  They believe it.
[02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:51.557]  They believe that this is a psychological ops operation designed to make you think of 9-11 to impact negatively the Democrats in the upcoming election.
[02:44:51.917 --> 02:44:54.579]  Alright, so I am now a Democratic Cook.
[02:44:56.801 --> 02:45:00.804]  You know, who armed... Before I get into the limbo, I wanted to say this earlier.
[02:45:01.164 --> 02:45:02.365]  Who armed China
[02:45:03.058 --> 02:45:05.078]  With the nukes and the missile secrets, U.S.
[02:45:05.098 --> 02:45:05.439]  government.
[02:45:06.339 --> 02:45:07.599]  Who armed North Korea?
[02:45:07.759 --> 02:45:08.119]  U.S.
[02:45:08.239 --> 02:45:10.660]  government, British government, Israeli government.
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:15.301]  Who gave Saddam the weapons in 83-84?
[02:45:15.361 --> 02:45:16.241]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:45:16.801 --> 02:45:17.141]  Who?
[02:45:18.862 --> 02:45:21.222]  Every time we look at who created Al-Qaeda?
[02:45:21.522 --> 02:45:22.522]  Our own government admitted it.
[02:45:22.903 --> 02:45:23.783]  Operation Cyclone.
[02:45:25.303 --> 02:45:27.684]  Over and over again, every crisis is created.
[02:45:27.904 --> 02:45:28.964]  Who's getting rid of the borders?
[02:45:29.733 --> 02:45:31.934]  Who's spending more money than all presidents before combined?
[02:45:31.954 --> 02:45:32.955]  You know the drill.
[02:45:33.295 --> 02:45:34.616]  Who's the enemy of this country?
[02:45:34.676 --> 02:45:36.016]  It's these Republicans!
[02:45:36.356 --> 02:45:39.158]  And of course the Democrats are run by the very same globalist crew.
[02:45:40.438 --> 02:45:42.660]  But that's what Limbaugh and these people are.
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:44.340]  They're there to pacify conservatives.
[02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:46.341]  They're there to make sure you don't see the full paradigm.
[02:45:46.361 --> 02:45:49.943]  They're there to call real conservatives, conspiracy theorists, and liberals.
[02:45:50.283 --> 02:45:54.385]  They're now calling Lou Dobbs a conspiracy theorist, liberal, and he's well known to be conservative.
[02:45:55.026 --> 02:45:56.927]  Keith Olbermann a conspiracy theorist, liberal.
[02:45:58.267 --> 02:45:59.228]  We just read the bills.
[02:46:00.103 --> 02:46:07.465]  You know, Limbaugh, you're a talented talk show host, and I learned not to trust the liberals listening to you when you first got on air 17, 18 years ago.
[02:46:08.965 --> 02:46:10.786]  Hard to believe, I mean, I've been on air 12 years.
[02:46:11.406 --> 02:46:13.427]  You've been on the air 5, 6, 7 years before me.
[02:46:13.907 --> 02:46:16.788]  I cut my teeth listening to him, but then I learned, wait, the Republicans lie too!
[02:46:16.808 --> 02:46:18.368]  Well, wait, they're owned by the same people!
[02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:22.929]  And Limbaugh's gotten more and more establishment over the years.
[02:46:23.730 --> 02:46:25.230]  More and more establishment.
[02:46:26.517 --> 02:46:30.338]  And I think about how he defends this system, and how he defends the status quo.
[02:46:31.418 --> 02:46:35.219]  And I remember so many times hearing him, and I really got turned off to him ten, twelve years ago.
[02:46:35.239 --> 02:46:38.540]  I mean, I still knew he was a phony conservative, but, oh, he was alright.
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:39.120]  He's rushed.
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:40.781]  You know, still, I kind of liked him a little.
[02:46:41.161 --> 02:46:43.342]  Because, you know, I'm a pro-gun guy, all that stuff.
[02:46:43.362 --> 02:46:44.462]  But he doesn't tell you about that.
[02:46:45.542 --> 02:46:51.584]  When he would say, put these people, you know, the Democrats are complaining that the first time someone's caught with cocaine, they're put in jail for five years.
[02:46:52.024 --> 02:46:53.164]  And the second time, fifteen.
[02:46:53.224 --> 02:46:53.924]  I think it's great.
[02:46:54.044 --> 02:46:54.965]  Throw the book away at them.
[02:46:55.185 --> 02:46:56.145]  The war on drugs is great.
[02:46:57.188 --> 02:47:03.952]  The whole time, and I've now been in radio a while, and a lot of big radio people who knew Rush back when he was in California, I'm not going to say anymore.
[02:47:04.413 --> 02:47:05.874]  He's been a hypocrite the whole time.
[02:47:06.694 --> 02:47:08.255]  And he's taking synthetic heroin.
[02:47:08.936 --> 02:47:11.217]  I mean, over a hundred pills a day in some cases.
[02:47:11.297 --> 02:47:12.058]  Totally addicted.
[02:47:12.078 --> 02:47:14.079]  It takes decades to build up a tolerance like that.
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:20.744]  It's well known he likes party girls and likes drugs and alcohol and a lot of other stuff.
[02:47:21.544 --> 02:47:22.345]  And you know what, Rush?
[02:47:22.405 --> 02:47:23.705]  I don't think you should go to prison.
[02:47:23.745 --> 02:47:24.926]  You do have a disease.
[02:47:24.946 --> 02:47:25.887]  You do have a problem.
[02:47:27.499 --> 02:47:29.780]  Uh, you know, I've never taken Oxycontin.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.942]  I never got into anything more stiff than marijuana back in college.
[02:47:34.562 --> 02:47:35.942]  Thank God I never really liked drugs.
[02:47:36.923 --> 02:47:39.484]  But I was never for putting everybody in jail because they used them.
[02:47:39.504 --> 02:47:40.484]  You're a hypocrite!
[02:47:40.744 --> 02:47:42.325]  And you're a sick joke!
[02:47:43.805 --> 02:47:46.766]  And I don't even think you need to go to prison, but maybe you need to teach you a lesson.
[02:47:46.966 --> 02:47:48.807]  But all your power got you out of it.
[02:47:50.348 --> 02:47:51.288]  You're a hypocrite.
[02:47:52.398 --> 02:47:55.559]  Just like with these pedophile Republicans up there.
[02:47:55.579 --> 02:47:56.960]  All the Republicans suddenly defend them.
[02:47:57.140 --> 02:47:59.360]  But when a Democrat does it, you say, throw the key away.
[02:48:00.181 --> 02:48:01.881]  Now they all need to go to the who's scowl.
[02:48:05.422 --> 02:48:08.743]  And so go ahead and attack us all day, Limbaugh, by accusing us of what you did.
[02:48:08.783 --> 02:48:15.846]  We said it was a PSYOP that you guys were already saying at Conjure 9-11 and trying to acquaint it with that.
[02:48:16.126 --> 02:48:17.566]  We said you were PSYOPing.
[02:48:17.906 --> 02:48:20.287]  You turn around and say we're PSYOPing.
[02:48:23.425 --> 02:48:31.290]  And you got a bunch of zombies who think they're conservative and who aren't listening to you, and I'm just sad for you.
[02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:36.793]  You took so much Oxycontin, and one of the symptoms is that it ate the nerve endings in your ears.
[02:48:37.914 --> 02:48:40.755]  So you got big old wires sticking out of your head like a robot.
[02:48:41.295 --> 02:48:41.956]  Darth Vader!
[02:48:47.609 --> 02:48:50.790]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.130 --> 02:48:53.071]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:53.431 --> 02:49:01.093]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.773 --> 02:49:08.836]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.216 --> 02:49:16.058]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:16.607 --> 02:49:20.649]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.949 --> 02:49:24.450]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.930 --> 02:49:26.831]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.171 --> 02:49:31.093]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:50.382]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:49:50.722 --> 02:49:54.923]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:49:55.223 --> 02:49:55.783]  We listened.
[02:49:56.123 --> 02:50:01.245]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:50:01.525 --> 02:50:02.025]  We listened.
[02:50:02.425 --> 02:50:05.567]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:50:05.987 --> 02:50:06.547]  We listened.
[02:50:07.027 --> 02:50:10.128]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[02:50:10.128 --> 02:50:10.809]  We're good to go.
[02:50:28.064 --> 02:50:30.786]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.

[02:51:40.289 --> 02:51:42.911]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:51:48.584 --> 02:51:53.930]  All right, I'm going to play the Bill Maher clip and then hit a final piece here, but we have time.
[02:51:55.031 --> 02:51:55.992]  But here's O'Reilly.
[02:51:56.012 --> 02:51:59.535]  I didn't get to this main point last Friday of all the lies he told.
[02:51:59.595 --> 02:52:01.778]  If you believe in 9-11 truth, you believe in space aliens.
[02:52:03.479 --> 02:52:11.868]  O'Reilly says to Fetzer, you know, just like I got Al Ararin, the former professor of USF, arrested and charged,
[02:52:13.082 --> 02:52:15.243]  To help lead a Palestinian terrorist group.
[02:52:15.604 --> 02:52:17.625]  I'm going to put them on you.
[02:52:17.705 --> 02:52:19.366]  You need to be looked at.
[02:52:19.886 --> 02:52:21.547]  He's calling for the arrest here.
[02:52:21.767 --> 02:52:23.268]  By the way, that guy was totally innocent.
[02:52:23.308 --> 02:52:24.268]  He found that none of it was true.
[02:52:24.308 --> 02:52:29.091]  He gave money to some mainstream charity that then gave money to some group in the Palestinian area.
[02:52:29.571 --> 02:52:32.793]  And then this guy, because O'Reilly said it, the FBI went and arrested him.
[02:52:33.013 --> 02:52:37.996]  And now he's not just saying it to a guy with brown skin, which they think they can get away with.
[02:52:38.516 --> 02:52:39.216]  I'm trying to hurry here.
[02:52:39.577 --> 02:52:42.138]  Now they're saying it to a former Marine Corps officer.
[02:52:42.887 --> 02:52:46.509]  Here is Bill, piece of trash O'Reilly.
[02:52:46.529 --> 02:52:48.330]  Here he is.
[02:52:48.570 --> 02:52:49.670]  We have no funding.
[02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:50.591]  We have no money.
[02:52:50.891 --> 02:52:52.692]  We're doing this because we believe in our country.
[02:52:52.752 --> 02:52:56.234]  And as a former Marine Corps officer, Bill, I resent your implication.
[02:52:56.274 --> 02:52:58.555]  We're interested in the truth and not being deceived.
[02:52:58.695 --> 02:52:59.515]  You hate your country.
[02:52:59.535 --> 02:53:00.736]  You hate the American government.
[02:53:01.296 --> 02:53:02.997]  You hate your country.
[02:53:03.057 --> 02:53:06.539]  You're accusing a man of murder, the President of the United States of murder, without any evidence.
[02:53:06.819 --> 02:53:10.441]  If you had the evidence, somebody, somewhere would take the evidence.
[02:53:10.701 --> 02:53:12.602]  Why don't you bring the evidence over to France?
[02:53:12.962 --> 02:53:14.523]  Why don't you give it to the French media?
[02:53:14.624 --> 02:53:16.045]  Or the Canadian media?
[02:53:16.325 --> 02:53:17.526]  Or the CBC or BBC?
[02:53:17.746 --> 02:53:20.829]  Are they controlled by the American Federal Government?
[02:53:20.849 --> 02:53:21.689]  Are they afraid?
[02:53:21.869 --> 02:53:22.810]  Why don't you take it there?
[02:53:23.251 --> 02:53:24.211]  See what they'll do with it?
[02:53:24.492 --> 02:53:24.672]  Huh?
[02:53:25.152 --> 02:53:28.355]  Billy, you're obviously not going to give me a chance to talk about any of these things.
[02:53:28.375 --> 02:53:29.396]  No, I'm not, because you're a nut!
[02:53:29.416 --> 02:53:32.258]  Go to our website, ST... Alright, we urge you to go to our website.
[02:53:32.298 --> 02:53:33.018]  We want the truth.
[02:53:33.099 --> 02:53:33.339]  Fine.
[02:53:33.559 --> 02:53:34.760]  Scholars for 9.
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:38.563]  You can't get any legitimate news organization in the world
[02:53:39.204 --> 02:53:42.206]  To put your stuff anywhere, because it's all bogus.
[02:53:42.286 --> 02:53:43.807]  And I don't care whether you're a Marine officer.
[02:53:43.967 --> 02:53:46.309]  You're disgracing the Marine Corps by what you're doing.
[02:53:46.709 --> 02:53:47.870]  You hate your country.
[02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:51.012]  You accuse a man of a murder, of being a murderer of President Bush.
[02:53:51.252 --> 02:53:53.794]  And you know, if I were Bush, I'd take a look at you, Professor.
[02:53:54.215 --> 02:53:56.836]  I'd definitely take a look at you, just like Sammy Al-Arian.
[02:53:57.257 --> 02:54:02.340]  I'd put the FBI on you, and then Nutty Barrett, and find out what the hell you guys are up to.
[02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:03.441]  Bottom line.
[02:54:04.031 --> 02:54:05.172]  Thanks for being here.
[02:54:05.232 --> 02:54:11.935]  There he is, the bully, because they're losing because 84% of Americans at a major poll know they're being lied to about 9-11.
[02:54:11.995 --> 02:54:12.735]  Go get the poll.
[02:54:13.015 --> 02:54:17.217]  Get the stories off Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net.
[02:54:17.657 --> 02:54:18.598]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:54:18.638 --> 02:54:20.198]  Don't let these terrorists have their way.
[02:54:20.218 --> 02:54:21.659]  Don't let them stop TerrorStorm.
[02:54:21.939 --> 02:54:23.080]  Get TerrorStorm on DVD.
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:26.362]  Get it out, make copies, get aggressive folks!
[02:54:26.402 --> 02:54:29.884]  Go to InfoWars.com, buy the DVD, get 9-11 Mysteries.
[02:54:30.284 --> 02:54:34.426]  Now here they are, Bill Maher, the liberals attacking Charlie Sheen on 9-11.
[02:54:34.647 --> 02:54:35.067]  Here it is.
[02:54:35.807 --> 02:54:43.812]  Listen to this, 36% of the American people think it is very likely or somewhat likely that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:54:44.232 --> 02:54:51.537]  They're conspiracy theorists who think that it was, the towers may have been brought down by a controlled demolition.
[02:54:52.282 --> 02:55:03.031]  Scholars like Charlie Sheen have signed on to this theory, so... Hey, if Charlie's buying into it, I'm buying into it.
[02:55:03.051 --> 02:55:04.292]  Go where Charlie goes.
[02:55:04.312 --> 02:55:11.378]  He wasn't mean at work, he's only... But he directed that.
[02:55:11.398 --> 02:55:15.241]  I mean, a controlled demolition, wouldn't they have had to have plant a lot of
[02:55:16.030 --> 02:55:17.491]  Demolitions in the building.
[02:55:17.511 --> 02:55:19.553]  Wouldn't have someone seen that?
[02:55:19.593 --> 02:55:20.815]  And if it was an inside job.
[02:55:20.835 --> 02:55:22.997]  Look, they can't get the lights on in Baghdad.
[02:55:23.057 --> 02:55:24.818]  They can't clean up after Katrina.
[02:55:24.918 --> 02:55:33.286]  I just don't believe that they could have pulled off 9-11.
[02:55:33.406 --> 02:55:34.588]  Alright, stop it right there.
[02:55:35.208 --> 02:55:36.089]  Because we're out of time.
[02:55:37.450 --> 02:55:38.271]  Play the rest tomorrow.
[02:55:38.311 --> 02:55:40.073]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:55:40.726 --> 02:55:41.666]  That's what they always say.
[02:55:41.846 --> 02:55:43.587]  Oh, they can't get the lights on in Baghdad.
[02:55:43.607 --> 02:55:53.631]  Their official plan from 83, and then again 2002, Pentagon of Israelis says, break it in three parts, sectarian war, strife, de-industrialize, shut them down.
[02:55:53.731 --> 02:55:55.472]  Don't let them have a first world country.
[02:55:56.132 --> 02:55:59.753]  They have executed Iraq with total precision.
[02:56:00.613 --> 02:56:01.594]  Like the war on drugs.
[02:56:01.674 --> 02:56:03.214]  More people on drugs, you call it a failure.
[02:56:03.555 --> 02:56:05.075]  Total precision.
[02:56:06.496 --> 02:56:08.236]  War on terror, you're going to take all your freedoms.
[02:56:08.356 --> 02:56:09.757]  Total precision.
[02:56:10.365 --> 02:56:11.366]  That's why they're in control.
[02:56:11.686 --> 02:56:13.087]  Total precision!
[02:56:13.488 --> 02:56:15.449]  Precision destruction of our freedom!
[02:56:16.470 --> 02:56:17.411]  God bless you all.
