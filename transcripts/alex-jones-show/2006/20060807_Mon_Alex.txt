[00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.027]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:07.748]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.570]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.031]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:12.692]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.353 --> 00:00:17.116]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:21.619]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.843]  Welcome my friends it is August 7th 2006
[00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:44.263]  On this live Monday edition, we're going to have wide open phones today for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:54.332]  We have a guest coming up in the middle of the next hour to speak a few minutes about Austin Energy putting in thumb scanners, biometrics, to log in and out of work.
[00:00:54.432 --> 00:01:02.459]  And while on the surface that might sound like a good idea, but where it really leads, what it's a small part of, a larger, much larger picture.
[00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:09.701]  I tell you, yesterday I did my new Sunday show on KLBJ 590 AM that covers most of the state of Texas.
[00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:11.623]  A lot of you tuned in over the internet.
[00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:14.505]  We're going to be syndicating it soon, hopefully with Genesis.
[00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:19.249]  But I was kind of mean to the regular listeners.
[00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.993]  I didn't take one of the calls that agreed with me, though there were
[00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:29.447]  Probably 50 of those on the board throughout the two hours.
[00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:33.850]  I would only take those that disagreed with me and I actually got what I wanted.
[00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:42.357]  I probably took about four calls, five calls that really disagreed with me and a few others that were just arguing over smaller points or issues.
[00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:53.526]  But the unifying theme was that basically I shouldn't be on the radio, that I should be taken off the radio, that I'm yelling fire in a theater,
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.061]  And then one guy screaming that I'm a Jew hater, that I'm a racist.
[00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:07.923]  When I was simply pointing out that Israel's done a lot of bad things to the Palestinians and the Arabs and that it takes two to tango.
[00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:14.124]  I thought in the US you were allowed to, as Colin Powell said, criticizing Israel is not anti-semitic.
[00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:17.725]  A large portion of the Jews in Israel are against these wars.
[00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:18.845]  I guess they're anti-semitic.
[00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:21.526]  I mean, really, that's what it's turning into in the US.
[00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:22.506]  We're not allowed to
[00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.211]  to criticize Israel, or our own government, or anybody else.
[00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:33.493]  Well, I have a right to do that, and I will not be bullied into silence.
[00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:53.902]  I think that the people that worship the aggressive, predatory government of Israel, whether they be Jewish or Christian, I think they're actually painting themselves into a corner on this, making enemies out of people that were worn against them, with the name-calling, and the demonization, and the rest of it.
[00:02:57.296 --> 00:02:59.879]  But I digress early in the broadcast.
[00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.183]  It's just mind-numbing.
[00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:08.250]  Mind-numbing that even my mild criticism
[00:03:08.997 --> 00:03:20.505]  Of Israel's crimes would elicit people calling up and threatening the board op, screaming at him so much, calling him so many names, that they would never even get on air and they would hang up.
[00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:27.150]  He said there were a couple of those calls, and I have known this, he was running my show for a few months while I was doing it over there.
[00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:33.027]  That he himself is Jewish and he was just shocked by it.
[00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:42.129]  He said he totally agreed with me and my analysis of what's happening in Israel, but these people are calling in threatening and screaming and yelling.
[00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:45.669]  It's really, really sad.
[00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.570]  It really is sad.
[00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:59.012]  And I was also talking about how vaccines have mercury in them and how it's brain damaging children and how there is no law that you have to take
[00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:04.041]  Vaccines to go to public school, or private school, or school for that matter.
[00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:10.629]  And I had a guy call in who disagreed and said, was basically saying, well, so what if it isn't a law?
[00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.852]  It's for your own good, so we act like it's a law.
[00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:28.440]  And so, it's still shocking to deal with people who are this wedded to a fraud, that are this ingratiated in the false reality.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.643]  So, when we get back, I want to talk a little bit about my philosophy and why I do what I do and what we really face as a society.
[00:04:35.663 --> 00:04:43.347]  I had a moment of clarity last night at about midnight laying in bed, thinking I couldn't go to sleep.
[00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.567]  Then we'll get into oil above $77 a barrel in Alaska.
[00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:48.708]  Pipelines shut down.
[00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.991]  Chinese regime eyes Texas port facilities.
[00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.491]  Oh yes!
[00:04:53.532 --> 00:04:55.193]  And a bunch of new 9-11 news.
[00:04:55.213 --> 00:04:58.515]  The 9-11 truth movement has turned the corner.
[00:04:58.615 --> 00:04:59.856]  We have gone supernova!
[00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.334]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:09.576]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:17.642]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:25.368]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.768 --> 00:05:32.654]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:37.226]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:40.969]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.370]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.613]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:10.904]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:22.555]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:28.680]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.400]  I don't know.
[00:06:46.052 --> 00:06:48.314]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188.
[00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.596]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.656 --> 00:06:50.076]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:51.598]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:05.597]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:08.457]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:11.438]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:16.779]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.539]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.420]  Now they look and feel great!
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.240]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.461]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.400]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.781]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:07:36.502 --> 00:07:39.683]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:07:40.324 --> 00:07:46.767]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:50.388]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:50.869]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:05.928]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:08.573]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.061]  I'm glad you're on board with us today.
[00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:26.642]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:30.204]  Thank you so much for caring about this planet, this country.
[00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:32.645]  Thank you for caring about your own destiny.
[00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.707]  Attempting to be involved, to be informed.
[00:08:35.727 --> 00:08:39.970]  That's all any of us are attempting and trying to do here together.
[00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:43.583]  We will have, again, open phones today.
[00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:46.384]  I will plunge into the news, the information.
[00:08:46.945 --> 00:08:48.166]  Your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:48.226 --> 00:09:01.134]  I do a lot of radio interviews, but the last six months or so, I've cut back a lot because I was busy finishing my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:10.951]  But I have now jumped back into doing interviews and have been doing about, I don't know, three or four a day for the last couple of weeks.
[00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:15.412]  And I go on broadcasts where the talk show hosts are hostile.
[00:09:16.552 --> 00:09:23.654]  I go on programs where they are neutral, where they ask piercing questions, insightful questions.
[00:09:23.734 --> 00:09:28.315]  I go on shows where the host is just making jokes and laughing.
[00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:30.315]  Basically, it runs the gamut.
[00:09:31.508 --> 00:09:59.561]  But in the last five years, coming up on five years, since the military-industrial complex carried out 9-11, I have gone from being on talk shows and being ridiculed and laughed at by the majority of the callers, I'd say 60-70 percent, to the vast minority of callers calling in who disagree with me about 9-11 and other terror attacks being inside jobs.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:09.169]  But yesterday, doing my own news Sunday radio program on KLBJ 590 from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:10:09.229 --> 00:10:18.680]  Central, I made the announcement, as I've made each week on this show and on that new show, that anyone who disagreed went to the head of the line.
[00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:27.169]  And quite a few calls, I don't know, four or five came in on 9-11, a couple others on other issues who disagreed with me.
[00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:32.211]  And so, unfortunately, all the great callers who agreed or had another point to make never got on board.
[00:10:33.392 --> 00:10:38.633]  But that's because in the past, people disagreeing has been so rare that I try to give them preferential treatment.
[00:10:38.653 --> 00:10:46.296]  If it becomes a regular occurrence where it's 50-50, I'll just go to calls and order as I do on this broadcast.
[00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:48.417]  Again, unless you disagree, go to the head of the line.
[00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:59.131]  Or maybe I should continue to put those that disagree to the head of the line, even if they're calling in en masse, because it really illustrated the mind-numb stupor that they're in.
[00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:13.559]  Or their lack of grasp for what the United States is all about, what the Bill of Rights is all about, because they were unanimously saying I should be taken off the air, that I shouldn't be on the radio,
[00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.051]  And then I was yelling fire in a theater, and that I was a traitor to this country.
[00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:27.693]  And two of them said, even if I say, even if what I say is true, it shouldn't be on the air.
[00:11:30.074 --> 00:11:31.774]  Now those listeners have always been there.
[00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:34.395]  And I guess that was the sixth show I've done on Caleb O.J.
[00:11:34.455 --> 00:11:35.375]  and never had them call.
[00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:38.593]  But why are they calling now?
[00:11:38.673 --> 00:11:43.415]  Because they're hearing about 9-11 being a self-inflicted wound on C-SPAN.
[00:11:43.435 --> 00:11:54.597]  They're seeing it all over Fox, and all over CNN, and all over MSNBC, and CNBC, and PBS, and in the Houston Chronicle, and the AP yesterday, and it's everywhere now!
[00:11:55.037 --> 00:11:59.699]  And they're hearing that 48% of the American people in major polls believe it's an inside job.
[00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:02.099]  And in another poll, 36%, or in a CNN poll, 84%
[00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:12.045]  And they're beginning to panic because deep down they know it's true.
[00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:14.867]  In their guts they know 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:12:14.907 --> 00:12:19.451]  And if they look at the evidence then they have the cold hard facts that it's an inside job.
[00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:30.099]  And they're desperately trying to cling to the shreds of their false reality in this sea of truth that is now deluging them.
[00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:44.835]  But the sad thing is the people that call up threatening board ops, call up screaming at people, call up just so mindlessly filled with hate.
[00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:52.719]  Let me just really tell you the place, or try to describe for you the place I'm at.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.361]  Imagine having to take a walk for a mile in my shoes.
[00:12:58.302 --> 00:13:00.383]  Imagine just being a happy-go-lucky
[00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:08.135]  Individual who learned about history and studied history and learned that governments are the most corrupt, evil things ever in human history.
[00:13:08.556 --> 00:13:11.639]  And that they've killed hundreds of millions of people last century alone.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:18.688]  And that a private banking system runs our country and has created a debt system by design to destroy the middle class.
[00:13:19.677 --> 00:13:25.800]  And to openly read published autobiographies written by David Rockefeller, where he says he's going to destroy U.S.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:48.671]  sovereignty and bring us into a one-world government, and to read official Rand Corporation documents where they talk about how we're all going to be enslaved, and how they're going to take our children from us, and to read CIA plans to forcibly sterilize and eradicate the population, and to catch them putting poisons in the water and the food and the medicines,
[00:13:49.668 --> 00:13:55.191]  And to know how cold-blooded and indiscriminate this elite is, and to know it is true!
[00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:57.872]  To know it is verifiable!
[00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:08.378]  And to realize that they are just expanding their ongoing carnage against the people of this planet!
[00:14:10.178 --> 00:14:16.862]  And the lies on top of lies, wrapped in doublespeak and spun in big shiny packages,
[00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:20.288]  It's so huge!
[00:14:20.368 --> 00:14:32.952]  The dark majesty of the fraud is so... ...gorgantuan and colossal and... How do you even begin to describe it?
[00:14:34.493 --> 00:14:35.253]  I'm in awe!
[00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:38.114]  I'm... I'm... ...babbling.
[00:14:38.134 --> 00:14:42.795]  I mean, just how do you even warn people it's so bad?
[00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:47.957]  And I listened to rebroadcast this weekend and there I am on the air...
[00:14:49.299 --> 00:15:01.929]  Of the weekday syndicated program, the Genesis program, and there I am describing how the elite are going to use terrorism to build compact city control grids, and how they're going to exterminate us, 90% of us.
[00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:14.399]  And that sounds crazy, it is crazy, because the government is openly saying it and preparing it, and their theoreticians are openly stating it, standing ovations, and they're really setting it up!
[00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:16.441]  And believe me, that's scary!
[00:15:20.124 --> 00:15:23.747]  And then you just see the mind-numbed population.
[00:15:23.807 --> 00:15:35.317]  You see the liberals who are tuned into their whole false political story, their false political paradigm, the false map of the world that they've been given by the left gatekeepers.
[00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.300]  And then you've got the neocons who are just a
[00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:48.547]  A giant cult, the followers of the neocons, who don't care if Bush is getting rid of the borders, or anti-gun, or signing on to U.N.
[00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:57.375]  treaties, or spent more money than all presidents before him combined, or done all these other horrible things, or if he's butchering the Bill of Rights systematically.
[00:15:57.955 --> 00:15:59.217]  They just don't care!
[00:15:59.577 --> 00:16:06.083]  They just love tyranny, and they love the end of this country, and they're just gibbering, weak-minded people.
[00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.920]  And really, at the end of the day, that's what this is all about.
[00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:12.202]  People deep down know something's wrong.
[00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:13.023]  They're scared.
[00:16:13.043 --> 00:16:21.408]  And so they decide to rationalize it all and make excuses to themselves and just go along with this.
[00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.752]  Well, I can't just go along with it.
[00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:28.413]  I don't have a choice.
[00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:29.854]  I can't control myself.
[00:16:29.894 --> 00:16:30.815]  This is who I am.
[00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:55.155]  And I love life, I love all that's beautiful in the world, all that's wonderful, all that's innocent, and it's threatened by these people that are totally ruthless, that run our planet, who one-up each other in the sadistic things they do to populations and see you and I as totally weak and pathetic because we have love in our hearts and have some type of conscience and compassion.
[00:16:56.455 --> 00:17:00.556]  And I'm just so tired of how naive people are!
[00:17:01.348 --> 00:17:03.229]  We're in such danger!
[00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:11.175]  Systematic eugenics is being implemented against all of us right now on a thousand fronts.
[00:17:12.516 --> 00:17:17.760]  Legions of wickedness are being unleashed upon us.
[00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:21.602]  And I get melancholy sometimes.
[00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:22.423]  I get a chill.
[00:17:22.503 --> 00:17:26.165]  I feel the cold darkness of evil.
[00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:28.247]  Last night I'm just thinking about
[00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:32.470]  How blessed I am and how beautiful things are and how much good there is in the world.
[00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:37.612]  And how it's been captured and threatened by this tiny inbred group of trash.
[00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:41.214]  And I thought about... I know people have fear.
[00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.754]  Fear of what their neighbors will think of them.
[00:17:42.814 --> 00:17:44.115]  Fear of losing their job at work.
[00:17:44.635 --> 00:17:47.897]  Fear of the church thinking you're strange.
[00:17:48.337 --> 00:17:50.198]  Fear of what your wife or husband will say.
[00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:52.929]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:53.589 --> 00:17:58.372]  If you know the truth about 9-11 and the New World Order, you've got to go public and fight it however you can.
[00:17:58.692 --> 00:18:01.534]  Because the people that carried out 9-11 are playing for keeps.
[00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:08.579]  I mean, they snuffed out 2,840-something people just like that on that morning.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.822]  They did it in a cold-blooded fashion, and they're going to do more of it.
[00:18:14.602 --> 00:18:16.984]  And somebody's got to stand up to them and say no!
[00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:23.302]  Somebody's got to have the will to say no to these people and to meet them head on.
[00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:25.885]  Believe me, I wish it wasn't me.
[00:18:25.965 --> 00:18:27.446]  I wish the world wasn't this way.
[00:18:28.928 --> 00:18:30.229]  I wish it wasn't this serious.
[00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:31.010]  But you know what?
[00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:34.673]  You can't change the facts by wishing.
[00:18:35.094 --> 00:18:36.375]  Wishing won't get it done.
[00:18:41.005 --> 00:18:56.956]  Believe me, we've turned the corner in the 9-11 Truth Movement, building over all these years as small groups of us worked to expose it, made films and wrote books, and then it built to a crescendo on the foundation we had built, loose change second edition, exploded and went supernova.
[00:18:57.725 --> 00:19:05.450]  And then that chain reaction into energizing all the other existing documents exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.951]  It all feeds into itself.
[00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:15.817]  And then C-SPAN, well before C-SPAN, then Charlie Sheen, because people saw his courage, no matter who Charlie Sheen is, they knew he was taking a risk.
[00:19:15.857 --> 00:19:17.018]  Everybody recognized that.
[00:19:17.358 --> 00:19:21.621]  That selfless sacrifice, that exploded from that point on.
[00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:24.883]  And then when we hit
[00:19:26.027 --> 00:19:32.951]  When we hit the C-SPAN airing four times, we left the atmosphere, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:35.932]  The rocket left the atmosphere.
[00:19:37.073 --> 00:19:40.415]  And a fuse was lit for a collision.
[00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:43.136]  Now the Globalists are having to deal with 9-11.
[00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:44.797]  They're having to try to debunk it.
[00:19:45.257 --> 00:19:46.638]  They're panicking en masse.
[00:19:47.058 --> 00:19:50.100]  There is a huge awakening happening right now.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.641]  This awakening has been happening, but now it's exponential.
[00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:55.980]  And we have entered the final phase of this conflict.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.460]  We have entered the deciding phase of this conflict.
[00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:06.402]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:20:06.462 --> 00:20:13.763]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:20:13.903 --> 00:20:21.765]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine.
[00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:22.946]  We're good to go!
[00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:48.680]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.220]  One and the same.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.441]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1%,
[00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:20.537]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:20.957 --> 00:21:24.098]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.358 --> 00:21:26.179]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:29.261]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:32.022]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.402 --> 00:21:36.004]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.484 --> 00:21:40.126]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.686 --> 00:21:43.528]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.864 --> 00:21:48.585]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:21:50.106 --> 00:21:50.406]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.426 --> 00:21:54.167]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:22.499]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:23.399 --> 00:22:30.045]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[00:23:00.888 --> 00:23:09.415]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:23:09.635 --> 00:23:11.457]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:23:11.657 --> 00:23:12.798]  That's one in four adults.
[00:23:13.188 --> 00:23:19.273]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:23:19.553 --> 00:23:23.215]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:24:02.328 --> 00:24:05.370]  We will take your calls and cover the news coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:11.215]  Boy, there's a lot of it, but finishing up my thoughts on really the state of the world, the state of the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:38.229]  It is scary, you know, to a certain extent, but you have to just get over it to go public and to point at criminal elements in the government and expose them for the murder they committed.
[00:24:39.129 --> 00:24:43.390]  Because then you have to admit that they're murderers, and that itself is terrifying.
[00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.671]  And then you are faced with the fact that you are now up against cold-blooded killers.
[00:24:51.550 --> 00:25:04.254]  I mean, think of the gall of these people to kill our own population and then to sit up there with straight faces and take the credit and, as I say, pose as our saviors.
[00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:07.636]  But that's what governments have done all throughout history.
[00:25:08.616 --> 00:25:11.237]  And it's time for a lot of people out there to grow up.
[00:25:11.972 --> 00:25:14.973]  A lot of people think that, well, reality is their view.
[00:25:15.073 --> 00:25:19.654]  That if you just decide something is one way, that that somehow makes it the case.
[00:25:19.674 --> 00:25:23.935]  That if you just deny that the government had nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:26.215]  If you just say the government's totally innocent.
[00:25:27.575 --> 00:25:29.276]  But somehow that makes it the case.
[00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:30.956]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:25:31.896 --> 00:25:33.337]  I've done the research.
[00:25:33.757 --> 00:25:40.278]  There's so much evidence that 9-11 was orchestrated in an inside job that it is staggering.
[00:25:41.718 --> 00:25:54.906]  It would take days to recite just bare synopses, abbreviations, boil-downs, cheat notes.
[00:25:58.008 --> 00:26:01.129]  I guess you could call it the Reader's Digest version.
[00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:06.292]  I take a deep breath just thinking about it.
[00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:10.435]  But then, for those of you that have trouble facing it,
[00:26:11.477 --> 00:26:13.198]  At a certain point, I can't blame you.
[00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:29.305]  It's easier just to have your bass boat and to think about nothing but the weekend and how you want to go to the country bar and drink beer, how you want to go to the liberal little coffee house and sit around slurping coffee talking about how wonderful Chuckie Schumer and Dianne Feinstein are.
[00:26:31.686 --> 00:26:38.629]  I understand that it's easy to basically stay like a child in denial, but childhood has to end.
[00:26:39.089 --> 00:26:40.290]  You know, you are adults.
[00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:44.595]  And think about being in my position.
[00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:48.099]  I mean, a lot of times when I'm going to bed at night, I think, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26:49.781 --> 00:26:51.022]  What a responsibility!
[00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.365]  Millions of people listen to me.
[00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:56.368]  I have started multiple movements.
[00:26:57.209 --> 00:26:59.171]  I have coined many phrases.
[00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:03.796]  I have defeated masses of legislation with your help.
[00:27:04.398 --> 00:27:06.079]  And I have all of these problems.
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:06.980]  I'm not perfect.
[00:27:07.941 --> 00:27:12.905]  But I have this incredible responsibility and I'm not performing at the level I should be.
[00:27:13.826 --> 00:27:15.247]  But still, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:27:16.588 --> 00:27:19.190]  And I think about what a target I am.
[00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.413]  How they love to kill me the minute I ever drop out of the spotlight.
[00:27:24.634 --> 00:27:27.136]  How they have threatened me so many times.
[00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:31.019]  How I'm basically on the razor's edge in everything I do.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.721]  Just totally
[00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:36.111]  Putting all my faith and trust in God.
[00:27:38.013 --> 00:27:42.177]  And I get asked every talk show, every talk show interview I do, why are you still alive?
[00:27:44.459 --> 00:27:47.602]  This government's so evil and done all this, why haven't they killed you yet?
[00:27:47.643 --> 00:27:50.025]  And of course it's a simple answer, they don't want to make me a martyr.
[00:27:51.847 --> 00:27:53.228]  I've put my work out there.
[00:27:53.248 --> 00:27:57.332]  It's been a testament and they could really give it
[00:27:58.078 --> 00:28:27.431]  Cult of personality status by killing me but it's a catch-22 because as I enter that realm without dying it tempts them to a greater and greater extent to strike me down and unfortunately I have my own analytical skills and I talk about this more and more because I can see a point approaching in the future where there is a extreme possibility that they will strike me down
[00:28:28.408 --> 00:28:32.250]  And I really don't want that to happen.
[00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.990]  I love life.
[00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.691]  I love it with incredible gusto.
[00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:42.935]  But at the same time, it is a sacrifice that I am more than willing to make because it is instinctive.
[00:28:42.975 --> 00:28:43.776]  It is spiritual.
[00:28:44.196 --> 00:28:46.597]  It is a basic need to defend the tribe.
[00:28:46.617 --> 00:28:50.479]  It is a core operating system.
[00:28:52.523 --> 00:29:10.227]  And program, no matter what the odds are, no matter what you face, that if there is a threat against your species, against your family, against your country, by a group of people that will give you no quarter, that they must be met head-on at 110%.
[00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:14.248]  And everything we are, everything we'll ever be, is owed
[00:29:17.017 --> 00:29:32.322]  To the people before us that made those sacrifices, and I know that human potential is almost unlimited, and we've got to get this parasitic elite out of control, the species, and our development, because we can do so much.
[00:29:34.103 --> 00:29:40.345]  And I know the promise of humanity in the stars, the creations we will make, we're in God's image, are so wondrous,
[00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:47.687]  That I am honored to die in the service of humanity to make sure we reach our potential.
[00:29:51.391 --> 00:29:52.292]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.773 --> 00:29:54.394]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:57.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:14.538]  Many companies were considered, but only one company made the final cut.
[00:30:14.778 --> 00:30:24.643]  The company that was chosen above and beyond the rest is the same company that you've been hearing about for months here on GCN, www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.

[00:32:01.263 --> 00:32:03.585]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:05.887]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:06.027 --> 00:32:13.074]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:21.922]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:06.976]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.611 --> 00:33:25.177]  We're about to go right to your calls.
[00:33:25.277 --> 00:33:40.126]  Just in closing and the whole discussion, well I guess the statements I was making in the last two segments, really the biggest pieces of evidence that prove that our government carried out 9-11
[00:33:41.764 --> 00:33:51.606]  Isn't the hijackers trained at military bases, or the public officials warned not to fly, or bombs in the buildings, and NORAD standing down, and all of that.
[00:33:51.646 --> 00:33:53.047]  I mean, that's all important.
[00:33:53.987 --> 00:33:57.968]  It's not just Northwoods and all the pre-plans to carry out those style of attacks.
[00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:03.889]  It's that the government knowingly has done similar things over and over again.
[00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:10.471]  They ruthlessly radiated tens of thousands of American babies and school children
[00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:18.345]  In radiation chambers, telling the GIs, husbands and wives that they were just getting x-rays.
[00:34:18.605 --> 00:34:20.267]  That's declassified, that's admitted.
[00:34:20.867 --> 00:34:22.870]  Thousands of times they sprayed U.S.
[00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.453]  cities with chemical, radiological and biological agents.
[00:34:26.674 --> 00:34:27.715]  Deaths resulted.
[00:34:29.224 --> 00:34:46.160]  I've talked a lot about this, but it's so important that Project Shad from 1947 to 1985, from England to Hawaii, just all over the world, having troops go out in fields and having aircraft fly over and spray them with nerve gas and kill them.
[00:34:47.081 --> 00:34:50.124]  This is mainstream news, but it comes out 40 years, 20 years, 30 years later.
[00:34:52.664 --> 00:35:01.988]  Telling a young officer, we're going to test the flu bug on you, sign this waiver, you get three days extra leave, go in this chamber, hit them with nerve gas, kill them, dissect their body.
[00:35:02.388 --> 00:35:04.689]  I mean cold-blooded murder of our troops!
[00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:19.274]  I've been talking a lot about it the last two weeks just because it was finally back in mainstream news, but we've been covering it for a decade that Bayer Pharmaceutical and others knowingly took blood that had HIV and Hepatitis C in it,
[00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:25.153]  People say, well they just didn't care and their documents show they knew and let it go on for a decade.
[00:35:26.773 --> 00:35:28.054]  But it's more than that.
[00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:30.475]  That's their business is killing people.
[00:35:31.156 --> 00:35:34.598]  That's their business is killing who they see as the weak and the infirm.
[00:35:35.098 --> 00:35:40.841]  They're eugenics Nazis, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:41.021 --> 00:35:43.462]  They believe in the ubermensch.
[00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:46.144]  They believe in killing the inferior.
[00:35:47.664 --> 00:35:48.685]  That's the whole point.
[00:35:49.986 --> 00:35:54.109]  That's the whole rationale to go ahead and give people Factor VIII that's going to kill them.
[00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:06.157]  Hundreds of thousands of people died in the U.S., tens of thousands in Canada, tens of thousands per nation in Europe, in Japan.
[00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:08.899]  The numbers are over a million.
[00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:12.601]  You get different numbers from different governments, different publications.
[00:36:14.262 --> 00:36:16.404]  Hundreds of thousands dead in this country.
[00:36:17.219 --> 00:36:27.063]  Little, innocent, mainly young boys, because it's an inherited trait predominantly with males, and it normally gets real bad by adolescence.
[00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:43.711]  Hundreds of thousands of young men who were loved by their mothers and their fathers, and the cold-blooded killers would give them a drug knowing it was going to kill them.
[00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:51.808]  And these naive people sit out there and say criminal elements of the government wouldn't carry out 9-11.
[00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:54.109]  Who is the Defense Secretary?
[00:36:54.129 --> 00:37:01.512]  He is a manifestly dark creature.
[00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:05.154]  He is a devil walking among us.
[00:37:05.214 --> 00:37:07.055]  The devil himself, if you ask me.
[00:37:07.075 --> 00:37:09.676]  He has stood by
[00:37:11.008 --> 00:37:12.830]  On so many evil occasions.
[00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:14.592]  He got aspartame.
[00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:16.254]  He was the man who ramrodded it.
[00:37:17.115 --> 00:37:22.281]  Aspartame through that is in its base wood alcohol.
[00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:23.863]  It is highly addictive.
[00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:27.207]  Now in 9,000 plus products.
[00:37:27.227 --> 00:37:29.169]  A scourge on our people's health.
[00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:54.245]  He's the guy that got the Terminator seeds and genetically modified plants approved, the ones that are taking over entire subspecies, entire species of corn, soybeans, jumping into many other plant species, jumping now into other bacteria and other fungus, jumping into whole different kingdoms of life.
[00:37:55.791 --> 00:37:58.833]  He's the guy who gave the chemical and biological weapons to Saddam.
[00:37:58.853 --> 00:38:01.035]  He's the guy that gave the nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:38:02.476 --> 00:38:06.619]  Just literally, he's the guy who presided over trillions being stolen from the Pentagon.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.741]  Trillions are now missing.
[00:38:10.602 --> 00:38:14.505]  And you watch him up there, he just radiates palpable evil.
[00:38:16.407 --> 00:38:16.947]  Palpable.
[00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:21.411]  A lot of these guys can cloak it, Rumsfeld cannot.
[00:38:22.372 --> 00:38:22.892]  He has been
[00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:48.560]  Overtaken by it, and I have to sit there and look at these cold-blooded killers waiting for them to strike again, waiting to wake up one morning when the power's off intermediately and some major city's been nuked and the phone lines are jammed and the killers are going to be on TV, long face, thumping their chest about how they'll keep us safe from the terrorists.
[00:38:49.213 --> 00:38:55.756]  There'll be a national draft, there'll be surveillance, there'll be arrest of those that criticize the government for our safety!
[00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:59.718]  And you'll get to keep your pension funds as long as you don't argue with them.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.442]  Oh man, I mean to know the magnitude
[00:39:08.448 --> 00:39:36.976]  of the public announcements that we are now in the American Union and they have now ordered every federal agency to begin merging with Canada and Mexico from our social security to our police to security to the military to produce and meat products just everything merging foreign corporations taking over the infrastructure the Arabs, the Chinese, the Spanish, the British, the Germans openly taking over our infrastructure
[00:39:38.248 --> 00:39:45.172]  Foreign governments like MI6 and Mashhad openly blackmailing and running whole sectors of the federal government.
[00:39:49.434 --> 00:39:51.235]  We have been blown wide open.
[00:39:51.295 --> 00:39:53.116]  Our gates have been blown off their hinges.
[00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:55.817]  Every barbarian horde has invaded us.
[00:39:56.238 --> 00:39:58.419]  They've gotten control of the propaganda organs.
[00:39:58.439 --> 00:40:00.220]  They're blasting us from the heights.
[00:40:01.914 --> 00:40:06.697]  And I see all these poor people driving around on the highways and living their lives.
[00:40:06.717 --> 00:40:07.858]  They're so naive.
[00:40:08.118 --> 00:40:14.802]  They don't know that, yeah, they've still got this confidence that America's the biggest and the best and invincible and it can't happen here.
[00:40:14.842 --> 00:40:16.123]  Well, I've got news for you.
[00:40:16.523 --> 00:40:17.904]  It did happen here.
[00:40:20.185 --> 00:40:25.109]  And it's only going to get worse until you really stand up and get involved and speak out.
[00:40:25.129 --> 00:40:27.290]  Alright, let's go to calls.
[00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.471]  Let's talk to Robert in Colorado.
[00:40:29.511 --> 00:40:30.472]  Robert, thanks for holding.
[00:40:32.448 --> 00:40:33.369]  Good morning, Alexander.
[00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.250]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.830]  How are you today?
[00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.651]  Fine, thank you.
[00:40:35.671 --> 00:40:36.251]  What's on your mind?
[00:40:37.312 --> 00:40:39.194]  I listened to you yesterday on the show.
[00:40:39.594 --> 00:40:40.174]  Great stuff.
[00:40:40.455 --> 00:40:41.375]  I enjoyed listening to it.
[00:40:41.395 --> 00:40:46.920]  I thought it was interesting, the people that you pulled on the line who disagreed with you.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:53.285]  When someone has no intellectual rebuttal, they often resort to name-calling and dropping F-bombs and such.
[00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:56.487]  And that's kind of what happened with those callers yesterday.
[00:40:56.527 --> 00:40:58.389]  They couldn't argue, so they just called you names.
[00:40:58.509 --> 00:41:01.191]  So, thanks for sticking in there and arguing intelligently.
[00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:10.988]  Um, I think I finally figured out why the Alex Jones Show does not take contributions and let me know if I'm right on or way off base.
[00:41:11.608 --> 00:41:20.795]  The reason you don't like to take contributions, is it because you're concerned if you amass a lot of money that the show could then get out of control and become corrupted?
[00:41:21.175 --> 00:41:24.217]  Like the Red Cross or whatever, is that kind of the reason you don't take contributions?
[00:41:25.478 --> 00:41:30.682]  You know, it's, I mean I've taken them and people send them, I just don't solicit
[00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:46.273]  I appreciate your call, Robert, because I would rather have people support us by getting my documentary films, getting the books we've written, we've published the other books and videos that we carry.
[00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:56.737]  Then you know that you are getting some information that will be put towards good use.
[00:41:59.438 --> 00:42:00.679]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[00:42:03.003 --> 00:42:08.484]  More than that, I literally turn down sponsors every couple days.
[00:42:09.064 --> 00:42:15.325]  And every once in a while on the website one or two will slip through and they'll be up for a week or so and we'll cancel them and send their money back.
[00:42:18.826 --> 00:42:29.408]  But I don't solicit contributions just because... I don't even like plugging my own documentary films.
[00:42:29.428 --> 00:42:31.928]  That's why you kind of get the same dry, staid
[00:42:34.707 --> 00:42:37.928]  You know, Bar King, whenever I do plug my films, they are excellent.
[00:42:37.968 --> 00:42:38.688]  I wish you'd get them.
[00:42:38.708 --> 00:42:39.588]  They're very effective.
[00:42:39.628 --> 00:42:42.830]  They're waking people up and that's how we fund what we do here.
[00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.392]  Really, in the final equation, I've got a little bit of money in the bank and I don't even spend it.
[00:42:50.212 --> 00:42:54.354]  I just, money to me is like food in the refrigerator.
[00:42:54.914 --> 00:43:02.917]  I don't go and stare at the peaches and the cheese and the milk and the orange juice and the heads of lettuce and pet them.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:30.332]  I mean, it's just, it's not, most people unfortunately, this isn't how Americans were in the past, but it is now, their identity is what they drive, their identity is how they look, their identity is the pose that they're striking and what they're putting on, and I guess maybe to some extent I was like that when I was a junior high student, but I've really never been like that since.
[00:43:34.296 --> 00:43:41.798]  And so I guess there hasn't been enough of a focus on money here in my operation, in my office, because we could do a lot more if we did have more money.
[00:43:42.898 --> 00:43:47.199]  And so many times when we did need money, we would get contributions that would just show up in the mail.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.560]  So I guess in a way we do take contributions.
[00:43:53.521 --> 00:43:58.762]  It's just I'd rather you call up and buy a hundred Terror Storms and give them to people.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.823]  That way you get a nice DVD to give folks or just buy one and make copies of it.
[00:44:04.863 --> 00:44:07.485]  But if you want to support us, buy a whole bunch of them.
[00:44:10.226 --> 00:44:18.892]  I mean, I do need to hire at least one more person to answer the phones for customer service so we can be more effective with people.
[00:44:20.313 --> 00:44:30.160]  But I would just much rather have people support us and so we can then spend that money to actually hire people out of money that we made from selling books and videos.
[00:44:31.895 --> 00:44:50.320]  The biggest reason is I don't want to be associated with the TVN style preachers in their $3,000, $4,000 suits and their $500 ties and their big fancy Cadillacs.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:58.081]  I don't want to be associated with... Here's another thing.
[00:44:58.262 --> 00:45:00.142]  I know people in the Patriot Movement
[00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:08.891]  Who make lots of money and then they're still on the air begging, saying they don't have money.
[00:45:11.633 --> 00:45:21.838]  And people wonder why every once in a while I fire a little torpedo out there saying, hey if you don't hear me endorsing a product then it means that I'm neutral on it or I don't believe in it.
[00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:27.101]  I mean really folks, I mean all the time I get huge offers
[00:45:28.579 --> 00:45:33.121]  I'll give you $10,000 to sell this vitamin and claim it cures all these things.
[00:45:33.741 --> 00:45:34.681]  I'm just not going to do it.
[00:45:35.901 --> 00:45:38.722]  Or I'll give you $5,000 a week to plug this.
[00:45:38.822 --> 00:45:43.904]  And of course, real sponsors with real products can never give you anywhere near that amount of money.
[00:45:44.424 --> 00:45:45.545]  Because they're real products.
[00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:49.026]  You see, it's part of the lie and the illusion of the world.
[00:45:50.066 --> 00:45:55.708]  Something real... People want some magic silver bullet.
[00:45:57.498 --> 00:46:20.363]  And then the people that are out there pitching all the snake oil, they pull their hair out because I, in my own little meek way, kind of let people know that I'm not associated with all that, when they have hurt this movement, and they have embarrassed me, and embarrassed so many other people, they just think they can crap all over me, excuse my French, and I'm just gonna sit here and take it?
[00:46:21.374 --> 00:46:29.697]  And that when I get embarrassed by it and sheepishly occasionally make a little comment so people know that I'm not associated with all of that, they get mad at me?
[00:46:30.257 --> 00:46:31.798]  Well, let people get mad.
[00:46:31.858 --> 00:46:34.258]  I'll just come all the way out with it if that's what they like.
[00:46:35.939 --> 00:46:37.400]  You see, I've got morals.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.261]  I don't claim to be a perfect person.
[00:46:41.021 --> 00:46:44.282]  But I try my best to do the right thing each and every day.
[00:46:47.759 --> 00:46:50.920]  I try my best not to steer my listeners into disinformation.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.621]  I try my best to tell the truth.
[00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:57.383]  I try my best to work as hard as I can.
[00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:00.544]  And we do work hard.
[00:47:01.684 --> 00:47:02.865]  And we do need your support.
[00:47:06.086 --> 00:47:14.829]  And I don't associate with a lot of people in the quote patriot movement or the truth movement because so many of them, it's the nature of man, the world's getting more and more evil.
[00:47:15.915 --> 00:47:26.358]  Are these egomaniacs who are grasping and want to be their leaders, and that's why they'll never be leaders, because that's not what it's about to be a real leader.
[00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:33.140]  A leader is really trying to find a way out of the fog, trying to find the path to the mountains.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.961]  A leader is really trying to help and save the people.
[00:47:39.362 --> 00:47:42.963]  Believe me, if we ever get in a position where we need donations from you, I will tell you.
[00:47:46.132 --> 00:48:03.084]  My only thing that upsets me is I know that if I don't take your donations, they'll go to some snake oil creature who could care less about this movement, care less about where society's going.
[00:48:04.525 --> 00:48:12.050]  And the lies that have been told about me, the way I've been stabbed in the back, the things I know about so many people that are out there, it's so sad.
[00:48:16.178 --> 00:48:16.898]  It's so sad.
[00:48:16.918 --> 00:48:24.400]  And now I've digressed.
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:31.442]  You know, I'm really just talking about a lot of issues today that we really don't spend a lot of time on, on this broadcast.
[00:48:31.482 --> 00:48:32.262]  I mean, here's another one.
[00:48:32.302 --> 00:48:33.802]  I kind of ended the show with this Friday.
[00:48:33.822 --> 00:48:40.023]  I don't talk about things that really can't be verified or double-checked or triple-checked.
[00:48:40.644 --> 00:48:41.844]  I don't talk about the
[00:48:44.759 --> 00:48:46.980]  This city will be nuked on this weekend.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.122]  Yeah, it gets you a lot of attention when you first say it, but discredits you in what you're doing.
[00:48:51.882 --> 00:48:54.703]  I try to traffic and truck with the truth.
[00:48:56.644 --> 00:49:00.626]  I might deliver it sometimes isn't the best, but people know I'm trying to tell the truth.
[00:49:00.666 --> 00:49:01.746]  I'm trying to get the truth out.
[00:49:01.786 --> 00:49:03.287]  I'm trying to find the truth.
[00:49:04.827 --> 00:49:13.811]  And there's all these stories that we hear out there that people put out that don't pan out, that can't be checked out.
[00:49:15.709 --> 00:49:26.661]  And just because the government and the media lie and twist and distort doesn't mean that everything in the alternative media is true either.
[00:49:27.282 --> 00:49:36.572]  Just because much of what the establishment says is a lie doesn't mean that it's like a yin and yang and we're over here on the other side and everything we say is true.
[00:49:40.226 --> 00:49:48.671]  I mean, there's all this verified mainstream news about concentration camps, but every call I ever get and every email I ever get, 90-something percent of them are about the rumors.
[00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:50.633]  The same rumors I've been hearing for 12 years.
[00:49:51.633 --> 00:49:54.615]  Why can't some of you people out there go get the Houston Chronicle?
[00:49:55.876 --> 00:49:57.537]  Or go get Army Purchase Orders?
[00:50:00.359 --> 00:50:01.359]  I mean, we link to it.
[00:50:01.459 --> 00:50:03.941]  You can go find out about the real concentration camps.
[00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:10.055]  I just don't understand it sometimes.
[00:50:10.156 --> 00:50:12.057]  And I'm not in a bad mood today, don't get me wrong.
[00:50:12.917 --> 00:50:15.819]  I just have had a lot of clarity over the weekend.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:23.404]  A lot of really, you know, in my guts, getting down to what it's really all about.
[00:50:25.745 --> 00:50:28.287]  And I know that we are facing a world of hurt.
[00:50:29.307 --> 00:50:36.592]  If we don't get our heads screwed on straight and agree on this, a pack of inbred scum runs our planet,
[00:50:37.435 --> 00:50:46.482]  And is engineering everything to further enslave us and deprive us of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and control our destinies.
[00:50:47.042 --> 00:50:49.344]  And I don't want to put up with it, and I don't want to go along with it.
[00:50:51.186 --> 00:50:54.608]  And if you want to support us, there's a couple ways you can do it.
[00:50:55.029 --> 00:50:57.991]  And I'll tell you briefly about that when we get back, then we'll go to your calls.
[00:51:04.588 --> 00:51:05.048]  It's here!
[00:51:05.268 --> 00:51:10.010]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.411 --> 00:51:18.074]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.754 --> 00:51:25.797]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.197 --> 00:51:33.060]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.587 --> 00:51:37.669]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.929 --> 00:51:41.431]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.911 --> 00:51:43.812]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.152 --> 00:51:48.054]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.238 --> 00:52:04.259]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:09.482]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.742 --> 00:52:14.103]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.384 --> 00:52:23.307]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:27.149]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.429 --> 00:52:32.455]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.755 --> 00:52:39.482]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.963 --> 00:52:40.503]  What about you?
[00:52:41.264 --> 00:52:46.608]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:47.395 --> 00:53:50.477]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.657 --> 00:53:56.620]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:07.445 --> 00:54:08.866]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:54:23.432 --> 00:54:24.753]  It has such a huge effect.
[00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:27.174]  It's so massive when you take action.
[00:54:27.734 --> 00:54:29.435]  We can bring these criminals to justice.
[00:54:29.495 --> 00:54:31.076]  Don't you see they're starting to fail?
[00:54:31.536 --> 00:54:33.317]  Don't you see the cracks in the facade?
[00:54:33.698 --> 00:54:35.298]  Don't you see their feet getting weak?
[00:54:36.099 --> 00:54:37.520]  Their clay feet cracking?
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.164]  Please, go to InfoWars.com and get my new film, Martial Law or Order of Death or the newest, Terror Storm.
[00:54:46.162 --> 00:54:47.083]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:47.103 --> 00:54:47.763]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:47.783 --> 00:54:53.548]  Or you can also write to me, I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, and don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:53.608 --> 00:54:57.070]  Fifteen cents a day, $5.95 a month, you get three months free when you sign up for a year.
[00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:16.434]  But go to the trial monthly subscription.
[00:55:16.474 --> 00:55:20.697]  You can download all 15 of my films, the weekly TV reports, and so much more.
[00:55:21.037 --> 00:55:27.441]  And burn them to disk in high-quality, high-bandwidth downloads, which is almost as good as regular television viewing.
[00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:31.304]  That's a great activist tool right there at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.901]  And be sure and tell all your friends about Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:38.701]  That's our goal.
[00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:41.942]  That's our currency, is waking more people up.
[00:55:42.002 --> 00:55:48.623]  That's what I'm trying to accrue, is people that are awake and involved and fighting the New World Order.
[00:55:48.663 --> 00:55:51.544]  You see, that's our goal, not making money.
[00:55:52.044 --> 00:55:55.084]  And that's why we put the films out for free.
[00:55:55.484 --> 00:55:58.585]  That's why we put out the higher quality bandwidth copies.
[00:55:58.985 --> 00:55:59.466]  We're good to go.
[00:56:10.862 --> 00:56:20.169]  Well, this month on the 26th of August in Dallas, Texas at the Lakewood Beautiful Art Deco Theater, I'm going to be there showing Terror Storm.
[00:56:20.209 --> 00:56:20.890]  I'll give a speech.
[00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:25.473]  Jim Mars will give a speech titled 9-11, JFK to 9-11.
[00:56:25.934 --> 00:56:34.440]  And then we're going to show some of the footage we shot up in Ottawa, Canada there just a few months ago at the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.741]  And we're going to have some live music.
[00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:37.863]  So that's going to be from about 7.30 till 2 in the morning.
[00:56:39.531 --> 00:56:41.292]  You can come see the whole thing or come see part of it.
[00:56:41.312 --> 00:56:42.173]  I hope to see you up there.
[00:56:42.493 --> 00:56:45.655]  Get your tickets again at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:45.715 --> 00:56:50.398]  And then coming up in September, tickets are already on sale for the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:56:51.159 --> 00:56:58.724]  Let's go ahead and go to Bert in Louisiana, then Linda, Nick, and Paula and others.
[00:56:58.764 --> 00:56:59.425]  Go ahead, Bert.
[00:56:59.665 --> 00:57:00.585]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:57:00.685 --> 00:57:01.026]  Good, sir.
[00:57:01.706 --> 00:57:02.447]  Look, I got two.
[00:57:02.567 --> 00:57:03.888]  One's a comment, one's a question.
[00:57:04.989 --> 00:57:21.220]  My word by John Gibson for the last past two days is talking about 9-11 and he has talked to the major people in the conspiratorial area and he's telling his people that are watching that you people are a bunch of nuts.
[00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:24.843]  And that's what my word two days in a row was about 9-11.
[00:57:26.095 --> 00:57:28.317]  And he has talked to the main people like yourself.
[00:57:28.797 --> 00:57:33.561]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:57:33.581 --> 00:57:37.824]  By the way, we have that video clip up on JonesReport.com right now.
[00:57:37.884 --> 00:57:41.186]  I forgot Friday to send that to the network to play it.
[00:57:41.987 --> 00:57:48.992]  And so I'm telling my crew right now, go get that Gibson clip, send it up to the network, and we will play that.
[00:57:49.654 --> 00:57:52.435]  Later in the next hour, but you're saying he's done that now another day?
[00:57:52.455 --> 00:57:53.696]  Well, it was two days in a row.
[00:57:53.716 --> 00:57:54.176]  9-11.
[00:57:54.576 --> 00:57:59.398]  I watch Fox, believe it or not, because, you know, I just try to get everything here.
[00:58:00.058 --> 00:58:03.320]  But two days in a row, 9-11 was my word.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.260]  Well, he doesn't usually stutter.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:13.584]  He's doing it now, because that coward may rationalize even to himself, but his guts, his spirit, knows the truth.
[00:58:13.904 --> 00:58:19.026]  Well, we know when he's bringing it up more frequently, he's a little worried about something.
[00:58:19.642 --> 00:58:24.104]  And he's letting the people know if we pay any attention... Hey listen, they better worry.
[00:58:24.124 --> 00:58:32.148]  This isn't like the Kennedy assassination where it's going to come out 40 years later with the mistress and the lawyer of LBJ saying he bragged about killing Kennedy.
[00:58:32.448 --> 00:58:33.589]  This is going to come out now!
[00:58:34.149 --> 00:58:36.990]  You hear me murderers and all the people that have covered up for it?
[00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:40.112]  How are you going to feel when it all comes out, you killers?
[00:58:41.052 --> 00:58:45.715]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.362 --> 00:58:58.003]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.665 --> 00:58:59.727]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.449 --> 00:59:01.531]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.212 --> 00:59:02.994]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.776 --> 00:59:04.577]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.339 --> 00:59:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:13.621]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:26.985 --> 00:59:28.945]  Now into our number two.
[00:59:28.985 --> 00:59:30.526]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:30.826 --> 00:59:32.126]  Oil is about $77 a barrel on Alaskan
[00:59:35.299 --> 00:59:42.565]  Shut down, BP says they had some type of pipeline problem, and so now they've shut down one of the major pipelines.
[00:59:42.605 --> 01:00:00.940]  Now understand, a fraction of Alaskan oil is allowed to be extracted, and 80 plus percent of it goes to China and Japan to fuel their economy, and then about 20 percent of it is sent to Canada and the western United States.
[01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:04.368]  In fact, it doesn't even take any more drilling.
[01:00:04.428 --> 01:00:06.749]  They have hundreds of capped mega-wells.
[01:00:07.929 --> 01:00:12.370]  That is admitted fact of incredibly high quality crude oil.
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.350]  And you're never going to have it.
[01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:18.211]  They've always blamed it on the environmentalists stopping drilling.
[01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:21.451]  No, the media always announces that they're stopping it.
[01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:24.972]  Bush has the House, the Senate, the entire legislative.
[01:00:25.652 --> 01:00:28.813]  He has the executive and the judiciary and the majority of the governors.
[01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:31.333]  And Alaska itself wants to drill.
[01:00:32.486 --> 01:00:34.887]  Wants to extract what's already been drilled.
[01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:40.188]  Wants to take it from the ground and the pipelines are there, but that is not going to happen.
[01:00:40.908 --> 01:00:43.569]  There is too much oil according to oil company documents.
[01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:47.430]  That's why they bought up hundreds of refineries here in the US and shut them down.
[01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:48.231]  Their own documents.
[01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:49.431]  Associated Press.
[01:00:50.551 --> 01:00:53.972]  And that's why they funded ten years ago the Peak Oil Fraud Movement.
[01:00:54.712 --> 01:00:56.193]  As Greg Powell has even told you.
[01:00:57.013 --> 01:00:59.914]  And that's why they're preparing you for artificial scarcity.
[01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:03.073]  It's really quite simple.
[01:01:03.815 --> 01:01:06.981]  Chinese regime has Texas port facilities.
[01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:13.094]  You know they already have the Long Beach Naval Station, the major deep water port on the west coast.
[01:01:14.483 --> 01:01:14.903]  The U.S.
[01:01:14.923 --> 01:01:15.884]  wasn't even allowed, U.S.
[01:01:15.944 --> 01:01:22.086]  companies weren't even allowed to bid, just like the Chinese were given the Panama Canal and now do the nuclear scanning at Freeport in the Bahamas.
[01:01:22.506 --> 01:01:28.808]  The Chinese are eyeing facilities in Texas to further economic invasion of the United States, American Free Press reports.
[01:01:29.328 --> 01:01:41.913]  Negotiations are underway for Communist Beijing to utilize a logistical hub, the former Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, which closed in 1995 during the Clinton administration's base reduction program.
[01:01:43.459 --> 01:02:03.285]  If the deal is consummated, the Chinese will also gain access to two major Texas ports at Corpus Christi and Houston on the Texas coast of the Gulf of Mexico, another 11,000 foot long airstrip which is part of the Kelly Base facilities, rail links with rail car switching facilities, and links with five interstate highways.
[01:02:03.305 --> 01:02:09.427]  The Chinese are keenly interested in the deal because the San Antonio base will help facilitate its trade with Mexico.
[01:02:09.947 --> 01:02:13.589]  Yeah, cutting out any middlemen with the slave goods coming right in.
[01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:16.551]  We'll get more into that later.
[01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:18.352]  But that's part of the American Union deal.
[01:02:18.372 --> 01:02:23.074]  The Mexican government will have control of large areas of Kansas City and St.
[01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:31.178]  Louis for major, quote, port facilities, as they're called, for the Trans-Navita highways that are being built right now and existing roads being sieved.
[01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:34.840]  And they will be foreign international American Union zones.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.501]  It's all official.
[01:02:37.893 --> 01:02:49.680]  But, again, the average neocon listener tunes in and sucks their thumb and hears about how evil Hillary is on networks run by Roger Ailes, where Roger Ailes is meeting weekly with Hillary Clinton, having fundraisers.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.460]  It's all completely staged.
[01:02:52.161 --> 01:02:53.762]  But, again, you're not going to figure that out, are you?
[01:02:54.842 --> 01:02:57.624]  You're the age-old moron who likes to be a slave.
[01:02:57.924 --> 01:02:58.424]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:00.886]  I just... These people are so pathetic.
[01:03:04.395 --> 01:03:08.277]  More on widening concern over Chinese organ transplantation.
[01:03:10.058 --> 01:03:12.819]  Some big news on the controlled demolition of the towers.
[01:03:12.839 --> 01:03:16.561]  9-11 demolition work suspended for one day.
[01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:23.744]  They're demolishing a building that was damaged going back almost five years ago.
[01:03:23.764 --> 01:03:27.446]  This is out of the Seattle Post-Intelligence here yesterday.
[01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:33.029]  Because of so much toxic dust and asbestos from Tower 1 and 2.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:41.069]  And then another report here where they announce the government secretly has a big warehouse filled with a bunch of debris from the towers.
[01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.852]  But of course, you're not allowed to go look at it.
[01:03:44.273 --> 01:03:45.394]  They're being very secretive.
[01:03:45.975 --> 01:03:48.198]  Well, why can't we look at it?
[01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.541]  Are you preparing some false samples or something for us?
[01:03:51.122 --> 01:03:51.923]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.144 --> 01:03:59.347]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:01.629]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:09.655]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.336 --> 01:04:17.381]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.781 --> 01:04:24.667]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:29.199]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:32.980]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.381]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:39.642]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.854 --> 01:04:54.855]  Good morning, honey.
[01:04:55.215 --> 01:05:01.261]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:02.202]  Yeah.
[01:05:02.582 --> 01:05:04.003]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:05:04.364 --> 01:05:07.827]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[01:05:08.287 --> 01:05:09.809]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:11.991]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:14.173]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:15.314]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:05:15.694 --> 01:05:17.956]  I brought our sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:05:18.237 --> 01:05:18.517]  What?
[01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:29.572]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:30.133]  You know?
[01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:33.077]  This is a terrific cabin and wow!
[01:05:33.357 --> 01:05:34.798]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:05:35.258 --> 01:05:36.419]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:40.241]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209 or get a Sport Berkey for only $39 by calling 888-803-4438 at 888-803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:41.562]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:58.739]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:00.740]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.343]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:07.643 --> 01:06:13.826]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Ripe discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.066 --> 01:06:21.550]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:24.771]  Now available is the 2006 Biosolutions Plus.
[01:06:24.972 --> 01:06:29.033]  The Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:06:29.174 --> 01:06:32.755]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:36.797]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:39.558]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:39.678 --> 01:06:42.080]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.621]  For more information call Biosolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:45.141]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:53.861 --> 01:06:55.942]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.502 --> 01:06:59.363]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.403 --> 01:07:13.729]  Jason Vermas, I think the most well-spoken and, let's just say, best on television of the Loose Change Boys was just on MSNBC.
[01:07:13.749 --> 01:07:15.749]  They tried to do a hit piece on him.
[01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:16.850]  It didn't work too well.
[01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:19.731]  We'll be airing that coming up later in the hour.
[01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:22.475]  I also have that Gibson clip.
[01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:23.336]  What's his name?
[01:07:23.376 --> 01:07:27.339]  John Gibson on... We call him the Albino Dracula.
[01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:29.140]  Everybody I know says he looks like a vampire.
[01:07:30.381 --> 01:07:35.285]  The big liberal from Fox Television posing as a conservative to try to fool us and bring down the country.
[01:07:36.206 --> 01:07:38.908]  He... Again, I don't believe in liberal conservative terms.
[01:07:38.968 --> 01:07:42.490]  I just use that because it best describes them for what they're really pushing for.
[01:07:43.731 --> 01:07:45.393]  I'll throw that back in the neocons' faces.
[01:07:46.133 --> 01:07:48.275]  We've got his clip where he disparages, you know,
[01:07:49.313 --> 01:07:54.794]  36% of the American people believe 9-11 is an inside job and we're all just nuts who hate George Bush.
[01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:59.075]  Hey, George Bush is a snot-nosed, cowardly puppet.
[01:08:00.736 --> 01:08:06.917]  I hate the guts of David Rockefeller and Lord Rothschild and Elizabeth Sachs-Koburg-Gotha.
[01:08:08.138 --> 01:08:08.378]  Okay?
[01:08:08.398 --> 01:08:10.438]  And I hate Henry Kissinger and George Stoltz.
[01:08:11.158 --> 01:08:14.779]  And I hate people like that that are actually in power and doing bad things.
[01:08:16.099 --> 01:08:16.400]  Alright?
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.040]  And I hate Bayer Pharmaceutical.
[01:08:18.692 --> 01:08:26.337]  And I hate the Health Department of New York that grabs little black kids and feeds them pesticides till they die, mainstream news, and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:28.158]  And I hate the U.S.
[01:08:28.258 --> 01:08:32.360]  Army that took its own troops and nerve-gassed them and killed them, just to test stuff on them.
[01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:34.482]  Okay?
[01:08:34.722 --> 01:08:35.642]  That's who I hate!
[01:08:35.902 --> 01:08:42.046]  I hate the cowards at the CDC who found out that the mercury was causing brain damage and covered it up and continued putting it in there.
[01:08:42.066 --> 01:08:44.348]  They have their own minutes of their own meetings.
[01:08:45.128 --> 01:08:45.989]  That's who I hate!
[01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.070]  I hate the people that are hurting us!
[01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:57.882]  Now, H-E-B, for those who don't live in Texas and surrounding states, is the biggest and most successful grocery store chain in the state.
[01:09:01.085 --> 01:09:02.847]  And of course, they're big mega-Masons.
[01:09:02.927 --> 01:09:09.755]  My grandmother, my one living grandparent, even went to college at Baylor in the same classes with Mr. Butts, the owner of the company.
[01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:20.235]  My grandmother always jokes that her friend, Butts, wanted to marry one of her friends, but her name was Rusty, and she said her name wasn't going to be Rusty Butts.
[01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:21.476]  That's funny.
[01:09:21.496 --> 01:09:22.677]  That's one of my grandmother's jokes.
[01:09:22.737 --> 01:09:33.204]  But the point is that they announced four years ago, and had it all over TV, that the thumb scanning was great, and it didn't keep your fingerprint total live.
[01:09:33.645 --> 01:09:34.605]  It was just quote numbers.
[01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:38.048]  Well, of course it's numbers that are then reassessed into the image of a thumbprint.
[01:09:38.628 --> 01:09:42.551]  And that it was totally wonderful, and would keep you safe from identity theft, and it was going to go in everywhere.
[01:09:43.143 --> 01:09:49.348]  They tried it in a few stores in Houston and College Station and it failed and so now they just make their employees do it.
[01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:58.376]  And I boycotted H-E-B for a few years over it, but I still go there occasionally now and I've stopped my boycott because Randalls and others are just as bad.
[01:09:58.396 --> 01:09:59.977]  They just have the smart cards.
[01:10:01.218 --> 01:10:02.679]  And so I'd go in H-E-B.
[01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.541]  We've got a guest coming on here in just a moment who's holding.
[01:10:05.896 --> 01:10:23.925]  So I'd go to H-E-B and every time I go to the one by my house, that's not true, there's been a few times but they haven't, but almost every time managers come over to me, head managers, assistant managers, they're huge fans, they say that a lot of employees are refusing to thumbprint to get in and out of work.
[01:10:25.546 --> 01:10:28.287]  Now the argument is, and the road to hell is paved with good intentions,
[01:10:29.756 --> 01:10:32.624]  That employees do cheat on time cards.
[01:10:32.664 --> 01:10:34.188]  They have their friends punch in for them.
[01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:35.792]  Stuff like that happens.
[01:10:36.855 --> 01:10:37.016]  But...
[01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:41.039]  Again, it leads to a national ID card, a cashless society.
[01:10:41.359 --> 01:11:01.613]  The official federal plan is they're going to make you thumb scan with the national ID card in the near future, which they passed last year, for verification for the national sales tax to make sure you're not, quote, cheating on the sales tax because it's going to be graduated and there'll be people who are in a higher sales tax bracket going and getting those that pay a zero sales tax to go buy goods for them.
[01:11:01.653 --> 01:11:06.796]  So there will have to be a record of what you buy to make sure you're not buying more than you could consume according to your
[01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:09.098]  You know, monthly income.
[01:11:09.118 --> 01:11:11.318]  I mean, this has all been officially announced, okay?
[01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:12.319]  They're putting it in.
[01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:14.539]  It is hellish control!
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:21.822]  Again, we barely beat the bill in Texas last session to put transponders and all inspection stickers to...
[01:11:23.576 --> 01:11:27.559]  Give you tickets and track you and tax you to turn all the roads into toll roads.
[01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:37.465]  And so now I've read that they went ahead and in a couple million of the stickers went ahead and did it anyways and I've been so busy I haven't had time to go out and videotape it and do a newscast on it.
[01:11:37.485 --> 01:11:39.707]  I mean this is how crazy everything is.
[01:11:42.268 --> 01:11:44.230]  This is all being implemented right now.
[01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.210]  Do you understand this?
[01:11:46.491 --> 01:11:48.933]  And I know that Dillard's and I know that
[01:11:49.691 --> 01:11:53.572]  I mean, department stores, just everybody's putting this in.
[01:11:53.872 --> 01:11:55.373]  You try to go to a tanning salon.
[01:11:55.393 --> 01:12:03.575]  I've gotten reports, probably a hundred of them in the last two years, in the news of grocery stores, tanning salons around the country doing it.
[01:12:03.955 --> 01:12:05.996]  You've got to do it when you go to the tanning salon.
[01:12:06.036 --> 01:12:10.237]  I've talked to friends who go to tanning salons and, oh yeah, you've got a thumb scan now when you go in.
[01:12:10.797 --> 01:12:12.358]  Health clubs are making you do it.
[01:12:12.858 --> 01:12:16.599]  I've read that they are going to start it at these Lance Armstrong 24-hour fitness.
[01:12:16.939 --> 01:12:17.780]  Boy, that's just fitting.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.180]  We'll see if they do that.
[01:12:21.525 --> 01:12:22.606]  All of this is happening.
[01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:26.308]  I mean, it's going in right now, and it's bad.
[01:12:26.348 --> 01:12:30.391]  I mean, it's muy hombre bad for the Cashless Society Control Grid.
[01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:32.592]  And we've got to fight it.
[01:12:32.632 --> 01:12:33.953]  We've got to say no to it.
[01:12:36.332 --> 01:12:38.212]  And there's so many other scary things.
[01:12:38.252 --> 01:12:48.275]  The government, if it has a copy of your prints on file, which they take, and most drivers, DMVs in the country now, under federal regulations, now under law by 2008, all of them will do it.
[01:12:48.675 --> 01:12:49.775]  There's only a few states that haven't.
[01:12:50.315 --> 01:12:53.256]  Did you know they can fake your thumbprints and handprints once they have that?
[01:12:53.556 --> 01:12:55.156]  You gotta have it to get into Disney World.
[01:12:55.176 --> 01:12:58.237]  You gotta have it to get into Disneyland.
[01:12:58.257 --> 01:13:00.818]  You gotta have it to get into SeaWorld.
[01:13:00.838 --> 01:13:02.698]  See, it's going in everywhere.
[01:13:05.154 --> 01:13:13.039]  But the big thing is it's going to be the quote verification with your new national ID card that is the state driver's license at point of sale.
[01:13:14.119 --> 01:13:22.324]  So I get this email and I did make a phone call about this and I did confirm that City of Austin is doing this with many other departments.
[01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:31.310]  Alex I found out today that my company is buying thumb scanners for employees and I stormed into my manager's office and said no way
[01:13:32.228 --> 01:13:33.209]  I was told I'd be fired.
[01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:36.692]  I'm an IT professional and have advanced knowledge of the purchase.
[01:13:37.553 --> 01:13:38.513]  I have a meeting on 8406.
[01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:41.716]  They did have that meeting at 10 a.m.
[01:13:41.756 --> 01:13:45.920]  with the head of the department in which I will lay out my reasons for stopping this.
[01:13:47.435 --> 01:13:48.096]  And it goes on.
[01:13:48.136 --> 01:13:51.099]  I was at your arrest at DPS way back.
[01:13:51.119 --> 01:13:52.821]  Yeah, that was in 97.
[01:13:53.382 --> 01:13:55.844]  And have a good arsenal lined up of information.
[01:13:56.225 --> 01:13:58.748]  The union is coming in next week to back me up.
[01:13:59.288 --> 01:14:00.530]  I will file a lawsuit.
[01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:02.812]  Several employees are already backing me.
[01:14:02.892 --> 01:14:04.054]  Not enough for a strike yet.
[01:14:04.394 --> 01:14:08.839]  I will probably be unemployed tomorrow afternoon and would be available for a short interview if you would like
[01:14:09.259 --> 01:14:10.520]  I really appreciate you having me on Alex.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.461]  It's news I need to get out.
[01:14:34.227 --> 01:14:38.748]  Tim, remember back in 97, I was reading the federal documents on air, how they were going to make everybody do this?
[01:14:38.788 --> 01:14:39.768]  And here it is!
[01:14:40.888 --> 01:14:42.409]  That was my inspiration for this.
[01:14:42.749 --> 01:14:45.549]  And after I sent you that email, we did have the meeting.
[01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:48.090]  And I went in there prepared.
[01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:53.751]  I was a little nervous, but I had document after document showing why this is junk technology and what it's going to lead to.
[01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:56.592]  And I just kept hitting them with facts and facts.
[01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:59.612]  They kept dodging and say, oh, well, it's just a pilot program.
[01:15:00.513 --> 01:15:01.853]  And it's very harmless.
[01:15:02.566 --> 01:15:05.708]  Recorded into an algorithm and nobody can decode it, and I showed them documents.
[01:15:05.748 --> 01:15:06.548]  Again, it's the same thing.
[01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.689]  We go, it's not your thumbprint, it's the numbers.
[01:15:08.989 --> 01:15:13.031]  Well, a digital photo's a bunch of numbers, and it's put back together as your picture.
[01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:22.575]  Exactly, and when you did your protest back in 97, even the local news channel came on and said, well, this helped identify the tornado victims.
[01:15:22.615 --> 01:15:23.116]  Remember that?
[01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:25.477]  Yes, in Jarrell.
[01:15:26.117 --> 01:15:28.158]  So, obviously, it can be decoded.
[01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:30.199]  It's not just harmless algorithms.
[01:15:31.073 --> 01:15:39.836]  And when Homeland Security or Fatherland Security comes knocking on the door like they did to Google and Yahoo and says, turn over these records, I don't think anybody's going to stand up and say no.
[01:15:39.896 --> 01:15:41.457]  And I don't want to be treated like a criminal.
[01:15:41.717 --> 01:15:42.777]  That's what you do to criminals.
[01:15:42.817 --> 01:15:47.059]  You take them down, you throw them, pin them, and say, here, scumbag, you're going to be tracked for the rest of your life.
[01:15:47.259 --> 01:15:51.100]  And I don't want to be a convicted felon for being an upstanding member of my community.
[01:15:51.883 --> 01:15:57.327]  Well, that's right, and they're going to use it for the National Sales Tax so people enjoy what's coming down the road for them.
[01:15:57.767 --> 01:15:59.308]  And so now they're trying to set you up.
[01:15:59.348 --> 01:16:05.312]  You sent an email with the word cowards in it, and so now they're claiming that you've created a bad work environment.
[01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:09.375]  No, they're the ones creating a bad work environment, enrolling you all as prisoners.
[01:16:10.335 --> 01:16:19.061]  Exactly, and I told them that I don't want to be treated like this, and being told three times in five minutes that I'm going to be fired if I refuse to thumb scan,
[01:16:19.628 --> 01:16:21.809]  That's a hostile work environment, and that's where it started.
[01:16:21.969 --> 01:16:23.670]  Well, notice they didn't do it yet, though.
[01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:24.571]  See, that's a threat.
[01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:28.173]  Those were terroristic, cruel, and unusual threats against you.
[01:16:28.893 --> 01:16:33.055]  And I've got the truth and the facts on my side, so they dodged questions.
[01:16:33.115 --> 01:16:35.296]  They actually refused to answer questions.
[01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:40.139]  They actually bold-faced lied in front of a high-level meeting.
[01:16:40.635 --> 01:16:45.239]  It's amazing when you put the spotlight on the cockroaches, how they scuttle under the refrigerator.
[01:16:45.399 --> 01:16:47.120]  Well, it's all going to be selectively enforced.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.442]  It's like GPS in police cars and buses.
[01:16:49.982 --> 01:16:52.504]  The corrupt system will use it to burn the good people.
[01:16:53.365 --> 01:16:59.329]  And, you know, if they had proper managers in place, the excuses they have to use this wouldn't be needed.
[01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.670]  Right.
[01:17:01.511 --> 01:17:05.634]  And I just think the people of the city of Austin need to know, I actually looked up the U.S.
[01:17:05.734 --> 01:17:10.278]  Code and presented this to them actually, which is the relationship between government and employees.
[01:17:11.081 --> 01:17:13.281]  And it actually says, if somebody wants to look it up, it's U.S.
[01:17:13.321 --> 01:17:13.882]  Code Title 5.
[01:17:14.142 --> 01:17:19.603]  It says that they cannot take a thumbprint, a photograph, or a voiceprint without your written consent first.
[01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:25.684]  And if they do, then it's a civil lawsuit is basically required, is what I was getting at.
[01:17:25.744 --> 01:17:28.464]  It is a giant document, and I just highlighted the stuff for them.
[01:17:28.964 --> 01:17:32.825]  But when I did that, the color went out of their faces a little bit.
[01:17:32.845 --> 01:17:34.945]  Yeah, they're like, we've got one that can see.
[01:17:34.985 --> 01:17:36.106]  We've got one that can think.
[01:17:36.126 --> 01:17:37.386]  He's put on the glasses.
[01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:47.955]  But you see, the Feds all write the laws as back doors so they can escape themselves, but then they selectively, through color of law, enforce it on us.
[01:17:48.335 --> 01:17:56.601]  It's like the mass hoax going on right now nationwide saying, it's the law, you'll be arrested if you don't vaccinate your kids, and they just added a bunch of new vaccines.
[01:17:56.641 --> 01:17:59.984]  What, I counted it up Friday, it was like 45 vaccines now.
[01:18:00.704 --> 01:18:04.725]  And it doesn't matter if there's no law, they will still arrest you for not doing it.
[01:18:04.766 --> 01:18:06.046]  People say, well how do they do that?
[01:18:06.506 --> 01:18:07.666]  They play a trick on you.
[01:18:07.787 --> 01:18:23.572]  They suspend you, though you didn't even have to have the shots to be in school, they falsely suspend you criminally, and then they try to criminally charge you for being truant when they have the waiver the whole time in their desk drawer, and by law we're supposed to give it to you.
[01:18:24.412 --> 01:18:25.932]  See how it's all deception?
[01:18:26.953 --> 01:18:29.853]  I want to get a little bit more on this story and find out where this is going.
[01:18:30.133 --> 01:18:30.653]  Tim Davis.
[01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:41.676]  Then we'll come back in the next segment and play some audio clips and take your calls for the balance of the program, all the latest developments in Israel, what's happening with energy prices, and the 9-11 truth movement is turning the corner.
[01:18:42.236 --> 01:18:43.696]  It's worth a point of no return.
[01:18:44.436 --> 01:18:47.337]  We are basically destroying the official story right now.
[01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:50.558]  It's hit supernova.

[01:19:55.086 --> 01:19:56.147]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.547 --> 01:20:02.030]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:03.090]  That's right.
[01:20:03.411 --> 01:20:05.692]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.252 --> 01:20:13.176]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.746 --> 01:20:21.437]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:21.878 --> 01:20:26.685]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:32.378]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.159 --> 01:20:37.300]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:39.881]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:39.941 --> 01:20:40.242]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:40.822]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.821 --> 01:20:57.122]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:58.142 --> 01:21:00.983]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:02.504 --> 01:21:12.168]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[01:21:52.876 --> 01:21:59.820]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:05.143]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:22:05.864 --> 01:22:12.908]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:22:13.809 --> 01:22:22.554]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:22:29.614 --> 01:22:30.075]  Just call today.

[01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:58.009]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:22:58.029 --> 01:23:03.731]  We're talking to Tim Davis, IT professional for many years there at Austin Energy.
[01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:09.833]  And they tell him, hey, we're putting thumb scanners in biometrics to clock in and out.
[01:23:11.094 --> 01:23:15.315]  And he goes in with the facts and shows them federal law and they start threatening to fire him.
[01:23:16.494 --> 01:23:24.476]  All of America, all the world, is being turned into a prison where every purchase, everywhere you go, everything you do, face scanning cameras, total control.
[01:23:24.856 --> 01:23:31.518]  And remember, it's run by the criminals in the government, the private corporations that control our government.
[01:23:31.598 --> 01:23:37.159]  And the people don't want toll roads, they don't want open borders, they don't want all these loss of freedoms, they don't want the war.
[01:23:37.599 --> 01:23:38.680]  The elite doesn't care.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.340]  It's the same thing with the electronic voting machines.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:52.726]  Proven to be fraud based, proven to be stealing elections, and they just smile and say, we got SWAT teams if you don't like it, don't get violent, or we'll send military trained troops to kill you!
[01:23:53.206 --> 01:23:54.447]  It's freedom!
[01:23:55.267 --> 01:23:56.688]  Going back to Tim Davis.
[01:23:56.708 --> 01:23:58.749]  Tim, where does it go from here?
[01:23:58.829 --> 01:24:00.290]  What are your other coworkers saying?
[01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.451]  What is your union saying?
[01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.112]  Well, I told the union about it.
[01:24:04.711 --> 01:24:11.837]  And before I said anything, I just said they're putting in thumb scanners, and before I even prompted or anything, he said, well, next thing you know, they'll be microchipping us.
[01:24:12.157 --> 01:24:13.358]  And exactly.
[01:24:13.378 --> 01:24:15.640]  Because it's incrementalism, it's the same old thing.
[01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:20.244]  But the thing I've really taken from this, Alex, is that I've been emboldened from it.
[01:24:20.524 --> 01:24:27.049]  Because it's intimidating to go up to these high-paid, you know, elitists, and confront them with facts.
[01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:30.993]  But when you do it, if people out there can just take a little stand, I'm nobody.
[01:24:31.453 --> 01:24:32.334]  And I think I'm
[01:24:32.941 --> 01:24:38.104]  Making huge progress in just the short time this has been going on, because they've backed down considerably.
[01:24:38.784 --> 01:24:51.811]  Well, what's happened at private institutions like H-E-B is they let certain people not do it because they need them, and then later kind of shuffle them off if they get somebody else hired, and then everybody else is quote, gotta do it.
[01:24:52.523 --> 01:25:00.066]  But if somebody in every city and every town said no, and sued cities when they tried this, we could stop this whole program from going into place.
[01:25:00.146 --> 01:25:02.167]  Folks, it's happening right now.
[01:25:02.267 --> 01:25:05.849]  At public schools all over the country, you have to thumb scan to get lunch.
[01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:07.390]  No cash allowed.
[01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:08.690]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:25:09.731 --> 01:25:15.253]  And like you, I've been preaching this gospel for many years, and everybody in this company knows exactly where I stand.
[01:25:15.293 --> 01:25:17.574]  So this is not a big shock to anybody that I would stand up.
[01:25:18.315 --> 01:25:21.456]  But half of the company, I mean, four years ago when I started,
[01:25:21.949 --> 01:25:25.650]  I was the pinfoil hat guy, you know, got ridiculed, and I actually enjoy that.
[01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:27.490]  I consider it a badge of honor.
[01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:35.292]  But now, about half the company is behind me, and nobody wants to get microchipped, and almost nobody wants to thumb scan.
[01:25:35.372 --> 01:25:36.492]  We're a public utility.
[01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:37.632]  It's public information.
[01:25:38.012 --> 01:25:42.913]  If we were at NASA flying space shuttles, yeah, maybe a thumb scanner, you could probably justify this.
[01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:46.134]  But there's no reason for this, and it's just ridiculous.
[01:25:46.414 --> 01:25:47.434]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:25:49.032 --> 01:25:55.397]  I mean, this information, you know, will get out there to people, but it's down the road what it's going to be used for.
[01:25:55.798 --> 01:26:00.261]  It's admittedly part of this wider plan, and you talk about microchips.
[01:26:00.861 --> 01:26:10.509]  The Mexican Attorney General, folks, two years ago, ordered his employees to take chips or to quit, to leave their jobs, that they were fired.
[01:26:11.392 --> 01:26:12.112]  We have U.S.
[01:26:12.152 --> 01:26:14.033]  companies trying to make their employees take it.
[01:26:14.053 --> 01:26:18.974]  Remember I had a sheriff on last year for Bergen County, New Jersey, who said he'll make people take chips?
[01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:20.635]  He would arrest them if they didn't.
[01:26:20.655 --> 01:26:21.395]  I remember that show.
[01:26:21.435 --> 01:26:29.738]  In Cincinnati, Ohio, that company, just a .com, is a condition of employment right now to have an embedded microchip, RFID, under your skin.
[01:26:30.178 --> 01:26:31.378]  This is in America, people.
[01:26:31.438 --> 01:26:32.659]  We have got to say no.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.600]  Wait till the feds nuke.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.960]  That's when we're all going to get it.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.301]  And people think, oh, that won't happen.
[01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:39.721]  Watch.
[01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:50.134]  After we get hit by a nuke, after we get hit by a nuke, if we do not expose 9-11 as an inside job, we will be hit by a weapon.
[01:26:51.054 --> 01:26:54.735]  And thanks to you Alex, I think a lot of people are really turning around.
[01:26:55.495 --> 01:27:00.237]  Like you say, it doesn't take much to put them back in their shells and not be able to speak out.
[01:27:00.577 --> 01:27:03.718]  But when you do it, people, I'm telling you, it makes you feel good about yourself.
[01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:05.398]  You're standing up for your own principles.
[01:27:05.979 --> 01:27:07.559]  Some things are more important.
[01:27:08.124 --> 01:27:14.647]  Nothing more important than your principles, though, and if you stand up for it, you'll feel good about yourself, and you'll be emboldened to speak out everywhere you go.
[01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:22.872]  Well, listen, if they fire you, you're going to have a major lawsuit, and just the intimidation you've been through, I think you need to go ahead and sue them.
[01:27:23.392 --> 01:27:28.074]  I mean, that's what these remedies are there for, and you need to let them know you're not going to put up with it.
[01:27:28.294 --> 01:27:36.819]  Do you think folks should call Austin Energy and tell them to leave Tim Davis alone, and that the people of Austin don't want to spend tax money to put thumb scanners in?
[01:27:37.705 --> 01:27:40.266]  It is going to be a big expense if it goes company-wide.
[01:27:40.666 --> 01:27:42.626]  And they're going to say, oh, it's just a pilot program.
[01:27:42.727 --> 01:27:47.148]  And I think just me standing up may back them off because they don't want the PR.
[01:27:47.568 --> 01:27:50.709]  And I don't want to encourage anybody to do anything they don't want to do.
[01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:57.111]  But if you feel upset about what's going on, I mean, I'm certainly not going to say don't do it.
[01:27:57.911 --> 01:27:58.291]  All right.
[01:27:58.351 --> 01:28:02.572]  Well, from my family to yours, Tim, I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:28:03.012 --> 01:28:04.393]  More people need to
[01:28:05.521 --> 01:28:13.805]  Put their jobs, put their lives, put everything on the line to say no to this system, and if more of us would do it, this would be easy to beat these people.
[01:28:14.685 --> 01:28:21.408]  Yes, and a quick plug, I am running for County Commissioner, so if I do get fired, somebody give me another job and I'll stand up for the little guy at the county level.
[01:28:21.968 --> 01:28:23.649]  And that's Travis County Precinct 4.
[01:28:24.009 --> 01:28:28.511]  Thank you so much for joining us, Tim, and keep us abreast as things develop.
[01:28:29.211 --> 01:28:31.472]  We don't want to be sitting here five, ten years from now
[01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.450]  Swiping our cards with the National Sales Tax.
[01:28:35.770 --> 01:28:36.771]  It'll be sooner than that.
[01:28:38.071 --> 01:28:40.653]  Wishing that we would have listened to Tim.
[01:28:43.395 --> 01:28:44.295]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.796 --> 01:28:46.377]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.317 --> 01:28:49.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.490 --> 01:29:00.093]  December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[01:29:00.373 --> 01:29:05.935]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[01:29:06.255 --> 01:29:12.738]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:29:13.018 --> 01:29:19.883]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:29:20.083 --> 01:29:24.546]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack.
[01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:29.130]  The house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:32.852]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[01:29:33.152 --> 01:29:36.575]  Its many self-sufficient and high security features will amaze you.
[01:29:36.935 --> 01:29:44.280]  With Nuclear World War 3 looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey, ready for a new owner.

[01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:08.151]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:19.814]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:27.579]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:30:27.859 --> 01:30:32.843]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:30:32.983 --> 01:30:37.966]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.

[01:30:53.236 --> 01:31:00.521]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[01:31:00.701 --> 01:31:03.744]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[01:31:03.864 --> 01:31:07.186]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[01:31:07.646 --> 01:31:08.046]  We're good to go!
[01:31:37.244 --> 01:31:40.006]  And since we are of nature, we should eat foods in their natural form.
[01:31:40.346 --> 01:31:44.469]  Only Grown by Nature offers a full line of re-natured nutrients.
[01:31:44.489 --> 01:31:45.190]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:51.454]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[01:31:54.216 --> 01:31:59.339]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.262]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:05.297 --> 01:32:07.059]  Alright, you've been holding long enough, callers.
[01:32:07.099 --> 01:32:09.020]  We're going to go straight to your calls very quickly.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.844]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:32:12.864 --> 01:32:18.228]  Let's go to Paula, and then Linda, and then Mark, Sasha, Babs, and others.
[01:32:18.328 --> 01:32:19.770]  Paula in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:24.033]  Okay, Paula's gone.
[01:32:24.073 --> 01:32:25.494]  Let's go to Linda in Rhode Island.
[01:32:25.534 --> 01:32:26.415]  Linda, you're on the air.
[01:32:26.455 --> 01:32:26.875]  Go ahead.
[01:32:27.696 --> 01:32:28.277]  Hi Alex.
[01:32:28.537 --> 01:32:28.777]  Hello.
[01:32:30.365 --> 01:32:34.511]  I have a son going into 7th grade and he has to get a booster shot and I don't like it.
[01:32:34.751 --> 01:32:35.472]  How do I avoid this?
[01:32:44.113 --> 01:32:58.245]  They have, by state and federal law, in the health department of every city and in the filing cabin or computer system of every principal, assistant principal, and their designates, the school nurse, a waiver form.
[01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:03.249]  And federal court cases and state cases show you don't even have to do that.
[01:33:03.309 --> 01:33:07.192]  You just say, conscientious objector, religious objections,
[01:33:07.592 --> 01:33:08.593]  And it is over.
[01:33:08.953 --> 01:33:13.097]  And if they try to kick your child out of school, you can then sue them for everything they're worth.
[01:33:13.157 --> 01:33:13.977]  That is illegal.
[01:33:14.178 --> 01:33:22.164]  What they try to do is not tell you about it because they get $4,000 per child just off of those shots for administration fees that you never hear about.
[01:33:22.405 --> 01:33:33.214]  In fact, our mayor, Will Wins, slipped up and said in the paper that we lose $500,000 a day if we don't vaccinate all the Austin kids.
[01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.615]  It is a crime.
[01:33:36.562 --> 01:33:41.345]  And, um, I've been trying to wake people up and, uh, people say, where do you get information?
[01:33:41.665 --> 01:33:42.625]  Like, on the computer.
[01:33:43.005 --> 01:33:50.669]  And everybody's telling me, don't believe anything you read on the internet, and these are all people that don't even know how to turn the thing on.
[01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:52.450]  It's unbelievable.
[01:33:52.470 --> 01:34:05.517]  Well, it sounds like you're hanging around with the wrong people, because in national surveys, uh, 84 to 36 percent believe it's an inside job, depending on what poll you look at, and everybody I talk to is waking up.
[01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.256]  Well, these people, I think they can't handle pain.
[01:34:08.296 --> 01:34:09.377]  They're a bunch of sissies.
[01:34:09.497 --> 01:34:10.817]  They can't handle it.
[01:34:10.857 --> 01:34:16.080]  They'd rather just go on with their life, drive their fancy cars, and think that that's going to protect them.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.560]  Oh, I agree.
[01:34:17.601 --> 01:34:18.281]  That's what they think.
[01:34:18.321 --> 01:34:20.502]  But I'm trying to understand something here.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:30.028]  Every major newspaper in the country has more readership online than they have in their physical circulation.
[01:34:30.668 --> 01:34:34.613]  Are they saying everything online is a lie, including the Library of Congress?
[01:34:35.393 --> 01:34:36.675]  That's just it.
[01:34:36.695 --> 01:34:38.777]  They never have gone on the internet.
[01:34:38.837 --> 01:34:41.720]  These are people who have never even gone on it telling me this.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.521]  Alright, well I appreciate your call.
[01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:44.261]  That's too bad.
[01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:46.783]  Just keep trying to wake people up in your area.
[01:34:46.823 --> 01:34:50.585]  Sounds like you're in a pocket of morons to me, but we do find it in pockets.
[01:34:51.046 --> 01:34:59.291]  I've had a lot of great folks in Rhode Island actually who like to know what's going on, but perhaps in her little area they just are particularly ignorant to the facts.
[01:35:00.391 --> 01:35:06.075]  We see this, though, about four or five years ago before a lot of people started getting on the web.
[01:35:06.115 --> 01:35:10.918]  Now, what, 60% of the population is on the web on a weekly basis and has computers?
[01:35:11.863 --> 01:35:13.063]  I think it may be higher than that.
[01:35:13.083 --> 01:35:14.404]  That number is a few years old.
[01:35:15.044 --> 01:35:21.385]  I know it was like 50% five years ago, and then I read 60% a few years ago, but it's exponentially growing.
[01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:28.107]  But I get emails and calls and people going, you're just faking those stories on your website.
[01:35:28.587 --> 01:35:31.187]  That says Infowars.com.
[01:35:31.507 --> 01:35:34.268]  That's not a real Associated Press article.
[01:35:36.255 --> 01:35:55.468]  And I would announce on TV and radio to those people or I'd even send them an email back and I'd say, well you're using email, you obviously know enough about computers to understand that we posted the AP article and at the top of the page there's a link to the original story and we put that link up
[01:35:56.668 --> 01:36:08.794]  There, so you'll know where it came from, but we save it because a lot of times they put those stories in archives or move them and we want an archive of this to prove our case over a long period of time.
[01:36:09.955 --> 01:36:17.379]  And then sometimes they'd email back or call back and go, I clicked on the link and it was an AP website but not the story!
[01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:18.779]  You lied!
[01:36:18.799 --> 01:36:23.502]  And I'd call them back or email them back, I don't have time for this now, we don't do this anymore.
[01:36:24.508 --> 01:36:29.613]  We don't get as many of these, but when we do with these illiterate people, computer illiterate, we just leave it alone.
[01:36:30.494 --> 01:36:31.374]  We try to explain.
[01:36:31.655 --> 01:36:36.819]  That's why we save the story, because they move them or take them down or they go to subscription.
[01:36:38.641 --> 01:36:45.227]  But if you take our headline and copy it into Google, you'll find it in other formats on other major publications most of the time.
[01:36:46.045 --> 01:36:51.629]  Or you can call the Associated Press, or you can subscribe and find it, or you can... There's just any excuse.
[01:36:51.989 --> 01:36:54.131]  Here's an example, and then I'm going back to your calls.
[01:36:54.411 --> 01:36:55.872]  I want to talk to Babs and everybody that's holding.
[01:36:58.694 --> 01:37:02.397]  Yesterday, I'm going over evidence on my Sunday talk show that I do.
[01:37:03.478 --> 01:37:10.422]  I'm discussing evidence of government prior knowledge of involvement in preparation to 9-11.
[01:37:13.266 --> 01:37:27.644]  And I mentioned the fact that 44,000 US troops and 18,000 British troops were massed in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and a small area of Pakistan in the months before 9-11, and that Bush, two days before,
[01:37:28.695 --> 01:37:36.217]  9-11, MSNBC and Newsweek reported, had the launch orders on his desk to attack Afghanistan.
[01:37:36.297 --> 01:37:42.899]  Remember, out of the blue, we're going to attack Afghanistan, and boom, it just magically happens, and no one wonders how long it took to mask those troops?
[01:37:43.539 --> 01:37:46.540]  I make that cogent point, stated it clearly,
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:55.283]  And a guy calls in and goes, I just got out of the Army with my Army degree, and I flew C-130s, and let me just tell you, you're a complete liar.
[01:37:55.583 --> 01:37:57.963]  There was no preparation beforehand to go to war.
[01:37:58.263 --> 01:37:59.984]  We can't move 44,000 U.S.
[01:38:00.444 --> 01:38:03.025]  troops with the entire fleet in two days.
[01:38:04.325 --> 01:38:06.726]  And I said, sir, I'm not saying it was in two days.
[01:38:06.786 --> 01:38:12.728]  I'm saying in the months before, and then Bush had the launch order to launch the attack on his desk two days before.
[01:38:12.988 --> 01:38:14.528]  No, no, you're a liar!
[01:38:14.708 --> 01:38:15.569]  You're a liar!
[01:38:15.749 --> 01:38:16.529]  You're a liar!
[01:38:17.612 --> 01:38:20.073]  It's totally admitted all over the news.
[01:38:20.113 --> 01:38:21.534]  The White House doesn't deny it.
[01:38:22.795 --> 01:38:24.235]  But I'm a liar!
[01:38:24.675 --> 01:38:27.417]  You see, they take anything we do and twist it.
[01:38:28.297 --> 01:38:31.218]  They make strawman arguments in their own heads.
[01:38:31.258 --> 01:38:42.564]  For those who don't know what a strawman is, when Popular Mechanics puts out an issue or puts out a book, they don't attack real things I've said and done.
[01:38:42.784 --> 01:38:44.945]  They made up things I never said.
[01:38:45.365 --> 01:38:47.186]  They made up articles I didn't write.
[01:38:48.183 --> 01:39:15.079]  And when Popular Mechanics called me, when Ben Chertoff, I didn't know, the nephew of the Homeland Security Director at the time, called me, he was so bumbling, and stuttering, and sounded so... I got off the phone after an hour-long discussion with the guy, and I said to my wife, I said, I think that's a 14-year-old kid.
[01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:16.080]  I think this is a prank.
[01:39:16.869 --> 01:39:33.099]  I thought it was a stupid, Kool-Aid drinking, video game playing, twinkie gobbling, fourteen-year-old, zip-faced kid, and I called Poplar Mechanics, and I called their editor, and I said, I don't believe this is real.
[01:39:33.119 --> 01:39:34.039]  Will you give me a call back?
[01:39:34.099 --> 01:39:34.660]  Is this real?
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.000]  I've never done that!
[01:39:36.321 --> 01:39:41.644]  In hundreds of newspaper interviews I've done, I've done like four or five in the last couple days.
[01:39:42.184 --> 01:39:43.145]  You could tell reporters.
[01:39:43.705 --> 01:39:45.246]  I thought this was fake!
[01:39:47.176 --> 01:39:47.576]  Okay.
[01:39:48.937 --> 01:39:53.998]  And I get a call back from the head editor of Popular Mechanics saying, oh no, Mr. Jones, it's real.
[01:39:54.778 --> 01:39:56.459]  What's his name, Magus or Mags?
[01:39:57.719 --> 01:40:00.500]  And, oh, I promise you, we just want to hear what you have to say.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.160]  I promise this isn't a hit piece.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.221]  And I said, do I have your word on that?
[01:40:04.341 --> 01:40:05.001]  Oh, yes.
[01:40:05.381 --> 01:40:06.321]  Oh, oh, you.
[01:40:07.062 --> 01:40:08.842]  I mean, they're a pack of liars.
[01:40:09.742 --> 01:40:12.283]  You know the government spent $1.6 billion in fake newscasts.
[01:40:12.913 --> 01:40:13.813]  That's just what we know about.
[01:40:13.833 --> 01:40:15.194]  I wonder who else is getting paid.
[01:40:15.734 --> 01:40:16.775]  Boy, I've seen the M.O.
[01:40:16.835 --> 01:40:17.215]  before.
[01:40:17.275 --> 01:40:19.296]  I think I can make a wild guess.
[01:40:19.676 --> 01:40:20.316]  What do you think?
[01:40:23.197 --> 01:40:24.678]  And it was all straw men.
[01:40:25.658 --> 01:40:30.781]  And mixing me in with people that have put out pretty shoddy stuff on 9-11.
[01:40:31.341 --> 01:40:32.561]  And that's what the media is going to do.
[01:40:32.581 --> 01:40:33.262]  They're doing it right now.
[01:40:33.522 --> 01:40:35.883]  They're not going to focus on the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:40:35.923 --> 01:40:36.623]  military bases.
[01:40:37.577 --> 01:40:39.698]  They're not going to focus on CIA insider trading.
[01:40:39.898 --> 01:40:43.499]  They're not going to focus on the government running drills and hitting the exact same targets at the exact same time.
[01:40:43.759 --> 01:40:47.881]  They're not going to focus on the PNAC and Northwood's documents calling for the terror attacks and planning them.
[01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:49.441]  No, no, no, no.
[01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:51.822]  They're not going to allow any of that.
[01:40:52.862 --> 01:40:55.563]  After they had me on CNN and I absolutely crushed them.
[01:40:56.564 --> 01:41:00.605]  I've had Fox set me up, what is it, four or five times in the last couple months.
[01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:07.953]  Many times in years past, and now when they call and some producers are all hot to get me on, I go, have you put this up to your higher-ups yet?
[01:41:08.233 --> 01:41:09.673]  Oh no, but I'm allowed to do whatever I want.
[01:41:09.693 --> 01:41:11.374]  And I go, you won't be allowed to in this case.
[01:41:12.915 --> 01:41:14.215]  I'm banned from Fox.
[01:41:14.976 --> 01:41:15.936]  They're afraid of me.
[01:41:16.436 --> 01:41:17.396]  They won't have me on.
[01:41:19.377 --> 01:41:22.739]  Because I will decimate their fake arguments.
[01:41:24.299 --> 01:41:30.502]  And they go, I get calls all the time from Reuters reporters and AP reporters and big newspaper reporters and I go,
[01:41:31.881 --> 01:41:34.303]  Oh, you really think 9-11 is an inside job?
[01:41:34.323 --> 01:41:35.364]  You looked at the evidence?
[01:41:35.644 --> 01:41:37.105]  Oh, you're interviewing all these experts?
[01:41:37.205 --> 01:41:39.407]  And I go, and you think you're going to publish this?
[01:41:39.787 --> 01:41:41.328]  Uh-huh, they've never stopped me in the past.
[01:41:41.408 --> 01:41:45.051]  I go, well, alright, I'll call you back in a few days.
[01:41:45.071 --> 01:41:47.613]  And I call them back and they go, listen, I've never had that happen before.
[01:41:47.653 --> 01:41:48.874]  They say they're not going with the story.
[01:41:50.536 --> 01:41:52.377]  I don't know why, I just put all the facts in there.
[01:41:53.918 --> 01:41:55.319]  And I said, welcome to the club.
[01:41:55.339 --> 01:41:57.021]  Okay?
[01:41:57.681 --> 01:42:01.344]  The only way you get in the media is if they misrepresent what you've said.
[01:42:02.156 --> 01:42:21.128]  That is the dominant media, or if they mix you in with a bunch of straw men, people who think space aliens attacked the World Trade Center, people who think planes didn't hit that, and I'm sure now, unfortunately I have to say it, it's gotten dangerous enough and big enough now, that either people are government agents that are saying that, or they're useful idiots.
[01:42:21.828 --> 01:42:24.450]  And anybody saying that planes didn't hit the World Trade Center,
[01:42:25.877 --> 01:42:29.019]  is really hurting the movement egregiously.
[01:42:29.399 --> 01:42:33.561]  Let me explain to people how blue screen works because I've dealt with it, I've worked around it in TV.
[01:42:34.082 --> 01:42:42.346]  Blue screen is a blue screen behind you and you set the chroma key to that level and it is impossible to project chroma key onto the side of a building.
[01:42:45.211 --> 01:42:52.537]  Number two, you couldn't do it across the sky, and holograms can only be projected in clouds, and it was a clear day.
[01:42:52.577 --> 01:43:04.826]  The biggest hologram engines they've got, and I know people that work with James Cameron, who's trying to re-revolutionize Hollywood, and switch from big screens to big screen, hollow screen projectors.
[01:43:04.846 --> 01:43:05.687]  You know that's the next phase?
[01:43:05.707 --> 01:43:06.887]  You'll hear about it in the next five years?
[01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:12.692]  And they cannot get them, you know, more than about a hundred feet tall
[01:43:14.036 --> 01:43:19.379]  And even then, they've got to add some type of mist, because it just doesn't work without it.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:29.223]  So, it is not, it's just, just to see what the government does, and not everybody's spouting this as government.
[01:43:29.923 --> 01:43:36.066]  A lot of them think they're avant-garde, think that that's how they get notices, come in with a new theory.
[01:43:36.086 --> 01:43:42.089]  I mean, I could be on every talk show in the country, every TV show, if I made a film,
[01:43:43.673 --> 01:44:07.157]  Saying that, you know, something ridiculous like there was a fusion, fish infusion, x-ray laser beam, and I talked to the secret agent at the Pentagon who installed the x-ray laser that was fired from a low Earth orbit blimp that hit the buildings and incinerated it at the exact same time, and there's gray aliens in Area 51 controlling it,
[01:44:11.485 --> 01:44:15.028]  I will not get all the attention because I am not going to do that.
[01:44:16.969 --> 01:44:20.392]  Frankly, I like it when legitimate people get more attention than I do.
[01:44:20.972 --> 01:44:24.475]  I love it when I see the Loose Change Boys on TV.
[01:44:24.715 --> 01:44:31.480]  I love it when I see other people like Webster Tarpley or Professor Fetzer getting attention or Stephen Jones.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:31.980]  I love it.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.001]  That's what I'm here to do.
[01:44:36.644 --> 01:44:39.786]  But it is horrifying
[01:44:41.658 --> 01:44:44.820]  To be lumped in with people that are on, most of the time, government payroll.
[01:44:46.341 --> 01:44:53.585]  And it's gotten so bad for the movement, though we're still winning and growing, I can just see what they're doing, that I might just have to come out against all these people.
[01:44:53.605 --> 01:44:57.827]  You know, I would do it strategically, because I don't normally sit here and infight and do all this.
[01:44:57.847 --> 01:44:58.728]  This wouldn't be infighting.
[01:44:58.748 --> 01:45:05.672]  This is something that... The problem is, is it would get even more attention on it, and then it could even make it worse for us.
[01:45:06.846 --> 01:45:09.428]  You know, there's even controversy among their ranks.
[01:45:09.948 --> 01:45:12.870]  Maybe it's just better to stay focused on the information.
[01:45:14.951 --> 01:45:21.755]  But a lot of the reasons that I want everybody else to be successful in exposing 9-11, the key is because it's about surviving.
[01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:25.572]  Stopping another 9-11 event that's going to be even bigger.
[01:45:25.592 --> 01:45:29.075]  If you look at these events, these government false flag events, they get bigger each time.
[01:45:29.175 --> 01:45:31.517]  And it's about kind of a schooling effect.
[01:45:31.818 --> 01:45:32.959]  Why do fish school?
[01:45:33.399 --> 01:45:37.402]  It isn't just because they hope that, you know, it isn't them that gets grabbed each time.
[01:45:37.462 --> 01:45:49.493]  It's because it confuses the fish, the predator fish, the grouper, the thrasher shark, the salmon, whatever's attacking the schools of, say, sardines.
[01:45:50.402 --> 01:45:52.584]  That they can't get a vector on them.
[01:45:52.624 --> 01:45:54.185]  It's like why zebras have stripes.
[01:45:54.225 --> 01:45:58.289]  It confuses the black and white vision of the big lions.
[01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:59.330]  The pride.
[01:46:02.752 --> 01:46:08.277]  So, I like it that there's more people out doing this.
[01:46:09.818 --> 01:46:11.520]  I wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell.
[01:46:14.026 --> 01:46:20.370]  Right now, as big as this movement is, if I was still the only one out here putting it out and telling the truth and getting the job done.
[01:46:22.771 --> 01:46:27.354]  Alright, there's also an attempt to make 9-11 only about Israel.
[01:46:28.094 --> 01:46:31.496]  And clearly, Israel has staged terror attacks against the USS Liberty.
[01:46:32.077 --> 01:46:35.639]  Clearly, Israel has staged terror attacks, according to Heratz and Jerusalem Post.
[01:46:36.343 --> 01:46:38.964]  against their own populations and created fake Al Qaeda groups.
[01:46:39.024 --> 01:46:46.508]  But Israel could not have NORAD stand down, could not control the whole attacks, could not run the entire operation.
[01:46:46.908 --> 01:46:51.710]  I believe clearly elements of Israeli intelligence were involved, so was MI6.
[01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:54.571]  But there's a crowd who wants you to think the U.S.
[01:46:54.611 --> 01:47:05.616]  government had nothing to do with it, and they want to make this a Jewish thing, so that then everybody exposing 9-11 can be lumped in with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:47:05.896 --> 01:47:07.856]  And again, I'm not going to fall for that one either.
[01:47:08.777 --> 01:47:15.978]  And not because it would be so damaging to go with an Israeli angle, it would be, but because it isn't true.
[01:47:16.418 --> 01:47:19.479]  And that doesn't take Israel off the hook.
[01:47:19.879 --> 01:47:21.939]  Israel is a criminal regime.
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:23.760]  Most governments are.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.081]  So I have the unique enjoyment
[01:47:30.547 --> 01:47:33.969]  of having to get death threat letters.
[01:47:33.989 --> 01:47:46.197]  I mean, I've had them from the Klan and other white supremacist groups where they cut out each letter from different magazines when they threaten you and mail it from some, you know, public post office box, some mailbox out on the street corner.
[01:47:47.698 --> 01:47:48.659]  I get to enjoy that.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:59.726]  And I get to enjoy, then, having people of the exact same mindset, really, you know, Likudnik Zionists call up and
[01:48:00.256 --> 01:48:04.559]  You better shut your mouth about Israel if you know what's good for you or something bad's gonna happen to you!
[01:48:08.321 --> 01:48:10.903]  As I make films exposing the Bushes as being Nazis.
[01:48:12.904 --> 01:48:14.525]  And Schwarzenegger as being a Nazi.
[01:48:14.845 --> 01:48:19.428]  But he's okay because he is a Nazi who they can control and blackmail and use.
[01:48:20.429 --> 01:48:26.813]  Just like they think now they've got Mel Gibson where they want him because of what he reportedly, supposedly said.
[01:48:27.653 --> 01:48:28.074]  And so...
[01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:36.112]  Now they can, basically, I guess he can give them $10 million a year like Schwarzenegger does, and he's not even a Nazi.
[01:48:37.232 --> 01:48:38.052]  Mel Gibson isn't.
[01:48:38.072 --> 01:48:44.194]  I mean, I guess if he pays them off a percentage of every movie he makes, they might say he's good now, but I don't think Mel will do that.
[01:48:44.915 --> 01:48:46.135]  That whole thing was like a setup.
[01:48:46.195 --> 01:48:47.475]  I haven't talked about that, you notice.
[01:48:47.515 --> 01:48:53.057]  I've been watching and studying and looking at it, but he's at a bar nearby, has a 1.2
[01:48:57.029 --> 01:48:59.130]  Alcohol level, that is extremely low.
[01:48:59.150 --> 01:49:01.272]  A few years ago that was the blood alcohol limit.
[01:49:01.312 --> 01:49:04.994]  That's about three beers for somebody who weighs 170 pounds like he does in an hour.
[01:49:06.055 --> 01:49:18.043]  He's supposedly all going wild and just so happens to be a Jewish cop and then he says all this stuff and then the police aren't going to release it but they do within hours and all that stuff's in it.
[01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:38.375]  And I think, you know, if he did say those things, it's untasteful and not really a good thing, but Israel gets to write in big official newspapers, I've got them right here, that the Palestinians basically aren't humans and they can kill whoever they want.
[01:49:38.435 --> 01:49:43.476]  I mean, that's just as... I mean, people are sick of the hypocrisy of Israel is the big thing.
[01:49:44.497 --> 01:49:46.117]  I mean, I'm against racism, folks.
[01:49:47.237 --> 01:49:51.879]  And so I'm against the Klan, and I'm against the Nazis, and I'm against what Israel's doing.
[01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:56.844]  It's here!
[01:49:57.104 --> 01:50:01.828]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:09.894]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.575 --> 01:50:17.620]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:24.886]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.396 --> 01:50:29.479]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.663]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.723 --> 01:50:35.644]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.985 --> 01:50:39.888]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:07.784 --> 01:53:08.485]  Babs in Texas.
[01:53:08.605 --> 01:53:09.646]  Babs, you're on the air.
[01:53:09.706 --> 01:53:10.427]  Thanks for holding.
[01:53:10.467 --> 01:53:10.847]  Welcome.
[01:53:10.907 --> 01:53:11.608]  How are you?
[01:53:11.888 --> 01:53:12.168]  Good.
[01:53:12.909 --> 01:53:18.574]  You just got through talking about Schwarzenegger, and I think I should add something before I tell you the other things I want to say.
[01:53:18.594 --> 01:53:22.918]  Schwarzenegger's father joined the Nazi Party in 1938.
[01:53:23.338 --> 01:53:25.340]  I don't think many Americans know this.
[01:53:27.402 --> 01:53:29.504]  I worked in a movie with him, Running Man.
[01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:33.251]  The back of my head and my blue silk scarf got a close-up.
[01:53:34.112 --> 01:53:37.413]  He's very funny, very delightful, but he is not presidential material.
[01:53:37.714 --> 01:53:39.214]  They're fixing to run him for president.
[01:53:39.514 --> 01:53:40.415]  Get wise, people.
[01:53:41.095 --> 01:53:50.760]  I just want to say that you keep talking as loud as you want, Alex Jones, because you are waking up the people all over the world.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:52.260]  Not just Texas.
[01:53:52.941 --> 01:53:55.802]  If they kill me, I'll just come back and haunt them.
[01:53:56.522 --> 01:53:58.644]  I'm not afraid to try and save my country.
[01:53:59.244 --> 01:53:59.484]  Only
[01:53:59.994 --> 01:54:02.316]  The person that we should be fearing is God.
[01:54:03.297 --> 01:54:04.457]  Now, I do believe that.
[01:54:04.918 --> 01:54:07.360]  Now, the Bible tells us to teach the truth.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:12.463]  If people do not want to accept it, or even hear it, get up and dust yourself off and leave.
[01:54:12.824 --> 01:54:16.647]  On the radio, the only way you can leave is if the listener can turn that radio off.
[01:54:17.327 --> 01:54:17.707]  Okay?
[01:54:18.368 --> 01:54:23.212]  But, well, you don't have to do that.
[01:54:23.792 --> 01:54:28.596]  You do not let any of these people who are dumbed down influence you.
[01:54:29.349 --> 01:54:30.590]  You're doing the right thing.
[01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:36.076]  I learned about this back in 1964 in California and it's happening.
[01:54:36.637 --> 01:54:41.742]  My mother said Babs don't tell anybody they're going to think you're a kook and that it would even begin to happen.
[01:54:41.962 --> 01:54:43.664]  Well it's happening and I tell everybody.
[01:54:44.144 --> 01:54:47.588]  The ones who get smart and they're informed from hearing your words
[01:54:48.027 --> 01:54:48.307]  I don't know.
[01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:18.435]  I realize the type of evil we're up against and I just can't imagine being in the dark like that and being so ignorant or stupid or ill-informed.
[01:55:18.455 --> 01:55:27.779]  I mean, I just can't imagine knowing what I know now and then trying to just get in the mindset of somebody who is in denial.
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:35.122]  I mean, it's horrifying to know how criminal this elite is when I'm aware of the facts.
[01:55:36.553 --> 01:55:46.158]  You know, the perspective of seeing somebody who's still in the dark, who's sitting right next to this stinking monster, this pile of maggots, and they don't even know it.
[01:55:46.698 --> 01:55:58.864]  You know, the elite really are, that's kind of an oxymoron, they are the alpha scum, they are the cancer of humanity, of the world, they are the darkness in the world, they are death.
[01:56:01.224 --> 01:56:07.686]  And they're arrogant, they're always full of themselves, they think they're invincible, they've got great power, and that gets them so far!
[01:56:08.326 --> 01:56:14.328]  But throughout history, that's what causes elites to implode and fall, is their manifest arrogance.
[01:56:15.108 --> 01:56:17.629]  And that arrogance is here with us now.
[01:56:18.489 --> 01:56:21.950]  And so, but I think, and in a way this is a bad thing,
[01:56:22.583 --> 01:56:24.985]  They've been arrogant about the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:56:25.025 --> 01:56:26.886]  They've been condescending.
[01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:28.548]  They've ignored us or they've laughed at us.
[01:56:28.988 --> 01:56:30.429]  Now there's fear in their eyes.
[01:56:30.469 --> 01:56:33.471]  And after we finish up some more calls, I will play the Gibson clip.
[01:56:33.491 --> 01:56:42.939]  I was in John Gibson demonizing 9-11 truthers on Fox and calling over a third of the American people, you know, idiots who just hate George Bush.
[01:56:42.979 --> 01:56:44.820]  And then we've got another clip of Loose Change Boys.
[01:56:45.321 --> 01:56:46.782]  One of them, Jason Bermas on
[01:56:48.354 --> 01:56:49.775]  MSNBC about an hour ago.
[01:56:49.795 --> 01:56:52.658]  That's going up on JonesReport.com by the way right now.
[01:56:53.018 --> 01:56:54.660]  Help get that out to everybody.
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.864]  But we'll come back and go to Mark and Sasha and others.
[01:56:58.904 --> 01:57:05.369]  The total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 and we will try to get to your calls a little bit quicker.
[01:57:05.429 --> 01:57:06.230]  I'm always trying.
[01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:07.611]  I'm getting better and better about it.
[01:57:12.674 --> 01:57:16.275]  You know, it's not depressing though that we're on the air talking about all this bad stuff.
[01:57:16.335 --> 01:57:17.295]  That's the good news.
[01:57:17.335 --> 01:57:19.275]  The good news is we are on the air.
[01:57:19.816 --> 01:57:22.076]  The good news is we are waking up a lot of people.
[01:57:22.136 --> 01:57:23.336]  More than you thought we could.
[01:57:23.356 --> 01:57:27.717]  But I've always told you, knowing who your enemy is, is half the battle.
[01:57:28.897 --> 01:57:31.678]  And then the other part is taking action and knowing you can win.
[01:57:33.058 --> 01:57:37.939]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.759 --> 01:57:50.399]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:52.120]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.841 --> 01:57:53.941]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.622 --> 01:57:55.422]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.183 --> 01:57:57.103]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.743 --> 01:58:01.365]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.926 --> 01:58:06.048]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.773 --> 01:58:18.975]  Mark, Sasha, Andy, Bill, Charles, everybody your calls?
[01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:22.350]  Are up right now.
[01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:25.592]  Now I'm going to play a few audio clips coming up and cover a bunch of other news.
[01:58:26.372 --> 01:58:28.173]  Right now, let's go to Mark in Wisconsin.
[01:58:28.193 --> 01:58:28.894]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:28.934 --> 01:58:29.614]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:58:30.355 --> 01:58:30.815]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:31.575 --> 01:58:36.939]  I called Wisconsin Public Radio this morning because they had Webster Tarpley on from 8 a.m.
[01:58:36.999 --> 01:58:37.659]  to 9 a.m.
[01:58:37.899 --> 01:58:38.360]  Good!
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.522]  And I wonder if it'd be alright if I could repeat what I said.
[01:58:41.542 --> 01:58:42.762]  It's about one minute.
[01:58:43.363 --> 01:58:44.063]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:46.565]  I hope I don't sound like I'm doing a book report, but I'll try here.
[01:58:46.785 --> 01:58:46.945]  Okay.
[01:58:48.632 --> 01:58:53.934]  I'd like to talk about Alex Jones, a 32-year-old talk show radio host from Austin, Texas.
[01:58:55.074 --> 01:59:00.616]  He did a live TV and radio show on July 25, 2001, one and a half months before 9-11.
[01:59:00.796 --> 01:59:18.222]  He gave an urgent request to his listeners to call Washington, their senators, their representatives, and warn them their government has plans to fly jetliners into the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden, the CIA agent, as a pretext to go to war in Afghanistan, Iraq,
[01:59:18.715 --> 01:59:19.436]  We're good to go.
[01:59:35.066 --> 01:59:35.786]  And that's what I said.
[01:59:36.006 --> 01:59:36.387]  Well, good.
[01:59:36.407 --> 01:59:37.527]  You know, I've asked Tarpley.
[01:59:37.947 --> 01:59:38.968]  We put him in the panel.
[01:59:39.008 --> 01:59:41.369]  He's gotten massive attention from, and he's a great guy.
[01:59:41.729 --> 01:59:44.450]  We've tried to build him up here and give him more attention than he's ever gotten.
[01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:55.014]  I've asked Tarpley, when he's on these shows, to please plug some website that has got the 9-11 Scholars Symposium roundtable discussion posted.
[01:59:55.094 --> 01:59:59.636]  Infowars.com has the almost two-hour roundtable discussions, like an hour and 48 minutes.
[02:00:00.476 --> 02:00:03.517]  You know, our four cameras shoot a lot better than C-SPAN's quality.
[02:00:03.917 --> 02:00:05.317]  Up there for free!
[02:00:06.258 --> 02:00:12.779]  And so, I hope Tarpley, when he goes on all these shows he's going on, will plug that for people.
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.080]  Yeah, that'd be good.
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:17.361]  Did he plug that folks could go watch the C-SPAN piece?
[02:00:18.081 --> 02:00:19.861]  He mentioned C-SPAN, yeah.
[02:00:20.201 --> 02:00:26.323]  He wasn't particularly familiar with the July 25, 2001 thing, but he remembered something about it.
[02:00:26.903 --> 02:00:27.964]  I'll tell you one thing, Alex.
[02:00:28.624 --> 02:00:29.644]  Since C-SPAN aired,
[02:00:30.529 --> 02:00:33.611]  We have a phase transition and a paradigm shift.
[02:00:33.631 --> 02:00:37.354]  There's a lot of people locally that have talked through that thought on C-SPAN.
[02:00:38.032 --> 02:00:44.554]  Well, the good part about C-SPAN was it took them a month to air it so the anticipation builds up to Fever Pitch.
[02:00:44.894 --> 02:00:46.475]  Then they aired it twice in one night.
[02:00:46.635 --> 02:00:48.436]  Once the next day and then once two days later.
[02:00:48.856 --> 02:00:52.937]  By that fourth showing we had huge audiences tuned in.
[02:00:53.257 --> 02:00:56.819]  And now millions of listeners of this show and other shows did what we asked.
[02:00:56.839 --> 02:00:57.979]  They all made tapes of it.
[02:00:58.039 --> 02:00:59.560]  They gave that tape to other people.
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:02.621]  The effects of it are just now being felt.
[02:01:05.774 --> 02:01:07.816]  What all was Tarpley talking about on NPR?
[02:01:08.156 --> 02:01:22.430]  Well they had another, like some kind of professor with terrorism, I think he was from Florida, I forgot his name, but he seemed to be fairly reasonable and so they were kind of doing half and half and then the commentator was making her comments and she was pretty fair too, I was surprised.
[02:01:22.731 --> 02:01:27.135]  Well that's because everybody knows in their gut it's an inside job and they know the very people that carried it out.
[02:01:27.899 --> 02:01:31.183]  Are menacing all of us and may kill a bunch of us at any time.
[02:01:31.243 --> 02:01:32.584]  I mean, you know, that's the point.
[02:01:32.624 --> 02:01:33.866]  People want us to forget about it.
[02:01:33.946 --> 02:01:40.693]  Okay, well, even if it's true, it's too scary and it would destroy the contract we have with the government and the people and everything would fall apart.
[02:01:40.913 --> 02:01:42.495]  Hey, they're not going to stop, folks.
[02:01:42.515 --> 02:01:43.957]  They're cold-blooded killers.
[02:01:45.018 --> 02:01:46.840]  We've got to expose these people.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.781]  None of us are safe.
[02:01:48.539 --> 02:01:51.300]  I mean, I'm out here risking my life to do this, folks.
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:53.280]  Believe me, I'm a canary in the coal mine.
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:58.861]  The least you can do is, you know, do what Mark did in Wisconsin and call into these talk shows.
[02:01:58.901 --> 02:01:59.581]  Keep doing it!
[02:02:01.942 --> 02:02:04.402]  Well, thank you for plugging InfoWars.com, too, my friend.
[02:02:04.422 --> 02:02:05.042]  I appreciate it.
[02:02:05.722 --> 02:02:06.642]  Thank you so much, Mark.
[02:02:07.123 --> 02:02:11.343]  We'll come back and go to Sasha and Andy and Bill and Charles and everybody else.
[02:02:12.023 --> 02:02:12.824]  What a great caller.
[02:02:13.664 --> 02:02:14.524]  And again, I'm not here
[02:02:15.994 --> 02:02:17.035]  Snapping at Tarpoli.
[02:02:17.255 --> 02:02:18.736]  I want him to be on every show out there.
[02:02:19.457 --> 02:02:21.399]  I just have heard him on the air and his info is great.
[02:02:21.419 --> 02:02:27.083]  But when you're on these shows, you've got to drive people to the websites.
[02:02:27.864 --> 02:02:31.587]  You've got to drive them to the better websites that are out there.
[02:02:32.488 --> 02:02:38.913]  And, you know, if we take the time to encode video and put it on the web for free, people need to plug it.
[02:02:39.574 --> 02:02:40.334]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:02:40.354 --> 02:02:40.875]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.570 --> 02:02:51.751]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.111 --> 02:02:54.031]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.391 --> 02:03:02.053]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.733 --> 02:03:09.794]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.175 --> 02:03:17.056]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.563 --> 02:03:21.665]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.906 --> 02:03:25.408]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.888 --> 02:03:27.789]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:32.052]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:58.623 --> 02:04:02.127]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:04:02.387 --> 02:04:06.611]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:06.871 --> 02:04:10.814]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:04:11.034 --> 02:04:17.580]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:23.304]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:23.524 --> 02:04:30.330]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:04:47.014 --> 02:04:51.176]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:51.416 --> 02:04:53.177]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:53.457 --> 02:04:59.800]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:06.263]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.523 --> 02:05:14.007]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[02:05:14.367 --> 02:05:17.229]  Now available is the 2006 Biosolutions Plus.
[02:05:17.429 --> 02:05:21.491]  The Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:05:21.631 --> 02:05:25.213]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:05:25.513 --> 02:05:29.255]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:05:29.435 --> 02:05:31.996]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:05:56.303 --> 02:05:57.243]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.263 --> 02:06:01.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.064 --> 02:06:06.186]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.366 --> 02:06:09.247]  Alright, we're gonna go straight back to your calls.
[02:06:09.367 --> 02:06:16.489]  I just want to invite everyone in Central Texas, North Texas, East Texas, Oklahoma,
[02:06:17.426 --> 02:06:31.740]  To come to a big 9-11 truth event, one night only, August 26th, that's coming up in 18-19 days, in Dallas at the historic Lakewood Art Deco Theater.
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:35.864]  We're going to show my new film, Peristorm, the final edition of it.
[02:06:36.585 --> 02:06:41.470]  We will then have, I'll have a speech and take questions and comments, then Professor
[02:06:42.213 --> 02:06:47.315]  Jim Mars, best-selling author, Jim Mars, will give a speech titled JFK to 9-11.
[02:06:47.495 --> 02:06:58.899]  Then I'll show about 35-40 minutes of the best footage we got at the Bilderberg meeting a few months ago in Canada with all the elitists and then two hours of great lounge music by Shanghai Five.
[02:06:59.359 --> 02:07:02.140]  That's from 7 o'clock at night until 2 a.m.
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.161]  You can come for the whole thing or come for just one of the films, whatever.
[02:07:05.721 --> 02:07:10.208]  It's $10.50 for tickets at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:10.488 --> 02:07:12.471]  That's cheap for an event this big.
[02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.233]  Again, that's InfoWars.com.
[02:07:16.164 --> 02:07:17.705]  I want this to be a really successful event.
[02:07:17.985 --> 02:07:19.166]  There's going to be some media there.
[02:07:19.186 --> 02:07:22.449]  We know the BBC is going to be there, and some newspapers are going to be there.
[02:07:22.489 --> 02:07:24.410]  So it's good to have a large showing.
[02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:29.434]  And the tickets have been going fast in the last weeks as we started selling these, though now it's slowed down.
[02:07:30.375 --> 02:07:31.195]  But you never know.
[02:07:31.235 --> 02:07:34.177]  I mean, all events have sold out except for one I've had in the past.
[02:07:34.197 --> 02:07:35.498]  So it'll probably sell out.
[02:07:35.518 --> 02:07:40.442]  So get your tickets now at InfoWars.com, or by calling toll-free.
[02:07:40.482 --> 02:07:42.243]  They can email you a ticket or mail you one.
[02:07:42.724 --> 02:07:43.344]  And that is
[02:07:45.469 --> 02:07:45.569]  888-253-3139.
[02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.629]  888-253-3139.
[02:07:45.689 --> 02:07:48.151]  And don't count on somebody else!
[02:07:57.674 --> 02:08:00.956]  To get my new film, Terror Storm, that really is our crowning achievement.
[02:08:00.976 --> 02:08:23.651]  The history of government-sponsored terror, 7-7 in London and the Madrid bombing and Spain being inside jobs, British intelligence caught dressed up like Arabs carrying out terror attacks in Basra and Baghdad, the latest 9-11 info, all these incredible interviews from Ray McGovern to Cindy Sheehan to Professor Jones to you name it, they're all in the new film, Terror Storm.
[02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:52.752]  So, the same toll-free number to order at 1-888-253-3139 or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 to get my new film Terror Storm or Road to Tyranny or Martial Law or any of the other great videos and books that we've produced or that we carry there on the online video and
[02:08:53.903 --> 02:08:54.403]  Bookstore.
[02:08:55.004 --> 02:09:01.607]  So please support us, but more importantly, these videos are waking people up, and it's up to you to get them out to folks.
[02:09:02.107 --> 02:09:06.369]  Okay, let's go to Sasha, who's been holding for eons.
[02:09:06.749 --> 02:09:08.150]  Where are you calling us from, Sasha?
[02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:08.890]  St.
[02:09:08.910 --> 02:09:09.430]  Louis, MO.
[02:09:10.151 --> 02:09:10.491]  Welcome.
[02:09:11.231 --> 02:09:13.773]  Yeah, we're just waiting for that new port to be installed here.
[02:09:15.874 --> 02:09:17.514]  That's right, Kansas City and then St.
[02:09:17.554 --> 02:09:20.556]  Louis are going to have Mexican-run port facilities.
[02:09:21.316 --> 02:09:22.857]  Yeah, the I-70 Mexico Highway.
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:32.063]  Um, I've been inspired this weekend and I wrote a bit of a rallying call to, um, I guess it's to people who are at least concerned and are somewhat informed.
[02:09:32.663 --> 02:09:33.684]  And I wonder if I could read it to you.
[02:09:34.944 --> 02:09:35.604]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:09:36.345 --> 02:09:38.866]  Um, working title will be Open Letter to America.
[02:09:40.586 --> 02:09:46.248]  We told the fear, the fear of fear, the dark itself, each other and ourselves, to support the troops and stay the course.
[02:09:46.769 --> 02:09:52.991]  Told if you are not with us, then you are against us, your senses are biased, and if you believe, you are lying eyes, then you'll be disappeared.
[02:09:53.513 --> 02:09:55.794]  Told trade your lives for images of security.
[02:09:56.094 --> 02:09:57.674]  Trade your judgment for insanity.
[02:09:57.954 --> 02:10:01.175]  Give up and give in because the killers say they'll watch your kids for you.
[02:10:01.715 --> 02:10:05.617]  Nero, an anti-Christian whore, burned my birthplace to crucify Christ's kin.
[02:10:06.017 --> 02:10:09.198]  Caligula killed anyone displeased by the madness of his divine sins.
[02:10:09.558 --> 02:10:10.058]  And Hitler?
[02:10:10.358 --> 02:10:10.978]  They're Hitler.
[02:10:11.138 --> 02:10:12.418]  A Reichstag for a Reich.
[02:10:12.799 --> 02:10:14.219]  American eugenics and a gang.
[02:10:14.579 --> 02:10:15.339]  Murder trio.
[02:10:15.379 --> 02:10:16.980]  You know the band's got a fourth, though?
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:18.980]  Terror starts a terror war.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:20.561]  Twin towers burned by Bush.
[02:10:21.323 --> 02:10:24.165]  9-11 was so self-inflicted, it is still killing us.
[02:10:24.825 --> 02:10:29.067]  PNAC will steal the peace, piece by piece, and neocon you it is for your securities.
[02:10:29.547 --> 02:10:36.111]  Bilderberger cookouts took out their own in droves and hordes, while Constantinian bohemian grovers slammed the doors.
[02:10:36.631 --> 02:10:41.234]  But we see you hiding there in plain sight, in a darkened White House, stealing away our light.
[02:10:41.794 --> 02:10:47.457]  You place your patsies on posters with wanted tags, send us to the mall and the soldiers' home in body bags.
[02:10:47.884 --> 02:10:53.327]  You dream of World War III and are fool enough to believe that anyone left behind will be allowed any form of victory.
[02:10:53.907 --> 02:10:59.270]  Terrorists' faces plastered to places in armed cars retrieving the aces.
[02:10:59.730 --> 02:11:01.831]  A ponzi shell game to misplace the blame.
[02:11:02.191 --> 02:11:04.812]  But we saw through somehow before the shells were gone.
[02:11:05.272 --> 02:11:06.373]  Who's most wanted now?
[02:11:06.753 --> 02:11:07.954]  The Info War is on.
[02:11:09.514 --> 02:11:10.435]  Well that's good!
[02:11:10.455 --> 02:11:12.656]  Email me that, we'll post it.
[02:11:13.317 --> 02:11:14.738]  I just did on your MySpace account.
[02:11:15.158 --> 02:11:15.658]  Oh, good.
[02:11:15.718 --> 02:11:16.218]  Good job.
[02:11:16.238 --> 02:11:21.500]  I will grab it off of there and post it on InfoWars or Prison Planet.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:24.681]  I tell you, I'm somewhat subdued today.
[02:11:24.741 --> 02:11:40.246]  I mean, I'm calm because I just thought about what we're facing over the weekend, but it really is unbelievable, but the facts are the facts, that we've got a pack of criminals that carried out 9-11 and all these other crimes up there posing as good guys
[02:11:41.013 --> 02:11:44.197]  And that so many of these stupid saps buy into it.
[02:11:45.338 --> 02:11:47.300]  I mean, why do they think we'd make this up?
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:49.062]  Why do they think we'd come up with this?
[02:11:49.123 --> 02:11:50.644]  I mean, we're going off of the facts.
[02:11:51.165 --> 02:11:52.647]  Believe me, I wish it wasn't true.
[02:11:52.687 --> 02:11:53.788]  Don't you wish it wasn't true?
[02:11:54.168 --> 02:11:54.849]  Absolutely.
[02:11:54.889 --> 02:11:56.311]  I wish all this stuff was gone.
[02:11:56.331 --> 02:11:59.174]  I do too, man.
[02:11:59.314 --> 02:12:00.496]  I don't like working this much.
[02:12:02.098 --> 02:12:15.784]  But I'm totally obsessed with it, because a normal person, if they know that murdering hardcore killers are in control, I mean, if you've got the evidence of this, and they're going to do it again, you've got to work hard to stop them, folks!
[02:12:16.805 --> 02:12:17.685]  With everything you've got.
[02:12:18.726 --> 02:12:19.766]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:19.786 --> 02:12:20.967]  That's a beautiful poem.
[02:12:21.307 --> 02:12:21.967]  Really well done.
[02:12:21.987 --> 02:12:22.607]  Very talented.
[02:12:23.208 --> 02:12:24.388]  Thank you so much for that.
[02:12:25.369 --> 02:12:28.390]  We'll get that, well, you said it's up on my MySpace account.
[02:12:29.614 --> 02:12:30.214]  So thank you.
[02:12:30.855 --> 02:12:36.238]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Illinois.
[02:12:36.258 --> 02:12:36.858]  You're on the air.
[02:12:36.878 --> 02:12:37.518]  Go ahead, Andy.
[02:12:37.938 --> 02:12:39.119]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:12:39.199 --> 02:12:40.420]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:41.340]  Bless you, my friend.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.001]  What's on your mind?
[02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:48.524]  I just want to give you a little testimonial about the effects of a conference on local talk radio.
[02:12:51.105 --> 02:12:52.686]  I actually turned on the local station.
[02:12:52.906 --> 02:12:54.367]  It's a news talk station.
[02:12:54.387 --> 02:12:56.228]  It has local programming only all day.
[02:12:57.148 --> 02:12:59.809]  And there was a guy talking about the 9-11 conference.
[02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:03.271]  That led to a whole two hours.
[02:13:03.672 --> 02:13:06.153]  The entire show was nothing but people calling in.
[02:13:06.173 --> 02:13:09.355]  I would say 75% saying inside job.
[02:13:10.155 --> 02:13:11.516]  So the following day I called in.
[02:13:11.536 --> 02:13:12.496]  I was the first caller.
[02:13:12.857 --> 02:13:19.660]  And I played the Larry Silverstein clipping of him admitting that he pulled building 7.
[02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:22.062]  That led to another two hours.
[02:13:22.822 --> 02:13:25.864]  And the talk show host was saying, I don't believe this.
[02:13:26.823 --> 02:13:29.325]  But there's a part of me that's making me scratch my head.
[02:13:29.985 --> 02:13:32.187]  If this is really true, our country is in trouble.
[02:13:32.527 --> 02:13:35.589]  I do not want to believe this, but you could tell he was becoming agnostic.
[02:13:36.530 --> 02:13:38.812]  The following day, another two hours.
[02:13:39.992 --> 02:13:40.633]  Same topic.
[02:13:41.874 --> 02:13:43.515]  And this is the local talk radio.
[02:13:43.595 --> 02:13:47.378]  Ed Schultz also devoted an entire show to this.
[02:13:47.618 --> 02:13:52.081]  And he took a poll and 69% of his audience believe that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:13:53.042 --> 02:13:54.903]  But Ed Schultz says, I'm not buying it.
[02:13:56.841 --> 02:14:06.545]  I mean, even with the host attacking the truth, you get the vast majority agreeing with the fact that it's an inside job, and it's because they've looked at the evidence.
[02:14:06.605 --> 02:14:24.533]  And listen, there's baloney out there, and there's stuff that isn't true, and there's mistakes out there, but if you look at the hundreds of smoking guns of 9-11, there's really over 600, but if you type into Google the 200-plus smoking guns of 9-11, we've got it posted on our site, but other sites have got it and have compiled it,
[02:14:25.438 --> 02:14:26.030]  To their credit.
[02:14:26.681 --> 02:14:27.882]  I mean, you look at that list.
[02:14:27.922 --> 02:14:30.143]  That's all true and all documented on that list.
[02:14:30.183 --> 02:14:32.204]  And there's the links to all the mainstream news articles.
[02:14:32.684 --> 02:14:52.253]  I mean, I challenge people who... I mean, even if you don't believe us, some listener out there driving along in Kansas or Austin, Texas or California, wherever you're listening, well, enough people believe this is a big enough phenomenon that you might want to just look into it and find out if you're wrong about your view or find out if we're wrong.
[02:14:52.773 --> 02:14:54.874]  And I mean, watch my film, Terror Storm.
[02:14:54.914 --> 02:14:55.815]  Go to Google Video.
[02:14:56.841 --> 02:15:01.786]  Type in TerrorStorm and you can watch my new film for free!
[02:15:02.266 --> 02:15:14.357]  Now listen, we won't be here unless somebody supports us and goes to Infowars.com and buys a high quality DVD of it and if you have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership we have super high quality bandwidth up there.
[02:15:14.397 --> 02:15:17.500]  It's a lot better than what you can get for free off Google.
[02:15:18.361 --> 02:15:20.843]  But again, it's there for free for anybody.
[02:15:20.923 --> 02:15:21.784]  I mean, go look at it.
[02:15:22.224 --> 02:15:23.145]  Go ahead, Andy.
[02:15:24.987 --> 02:15:28.210]  I had a question unrelated to 9-11 about the microchip.
[02:15:28.571 --> 02:15:28.811]  Sure.
[02:15:29.091 --> 02:15:33.716]  Which Latin American countries are promoting the microchip?
[02:15:34.637 --> 02:15:37.400]  You know, the other day, a few weeks ago, I read an article.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.624]  It's two Latin American countries, and I didn't go look.
[02:15:42.104 --> 02:15:43.125]  My memory fails me.
[02:15:44.046 --> 02:15:48.731]  But if you just type in, Latin American president proposes microchipping, you'll get it.
[02:15:49.874 --> 02:15:53.277]  Hillary said she thinks the corporations want to put brain chips in everybody.
[02:15:53.317 --> 02:15:57.199]  She was serious when she told New York Daily News that two weeks ago.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:01.102]  But I forget which Latin American countries that was.
[02:16:01.142 --> 02:16:01.422]  You know what?
[02:16:01.742 --> 02:16:03.524]  I'll look that up during the break and come back and tell you.
[02:16:03.544 --> 02:16:04.264]  All right.
[02:16:04.304 --> 02:16:06.786]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:16:06.846 --> 02:16:08.007]  And once again, God bless you.
[02:16:08.187 --> 02:16:08.487]  Well, no.
[02:16:08.547 --> 02:16:09.247]  Thank you, Andy.
[02:16:09.648 --> 02:16:13.610]  The key is when you're on these radio talk shows, though, is to give people websites.
[02:16:14.311 --> 02:16:15.892]  It's good to sit there and talk about it, but
[02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:20.324]  But when you get on these shows, you need to hit people with the evidence.
[02:16:20.344 --> 02:16:22.285]  Let's put another call in.
[02:16:22.685 --> 02:16:23.906]  Bill in Chicago.
[02:16:23.986 --> 02:16:24.606]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:16:25.587 --> 02:16:25.867]  Alex?
[02:16:26.227 --> 02:16:26.588]  Hello.
[02:16:27.308 --> 02:16:30.070]  Alex, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year now.
[02:16:30.710 --> 02:16:35.113]  First of all, I want to say thank you very much for waking me up three years ago with my security.
[02:16:35.374 --> 02:16:37.175]  Are you on an IT phone, sir?
[02:16:37.735 --> 02:16:40.417]  No, I'm on a cordless chest.
[02:16:41.057 --> 02:16:42.338]  You've got to get closer to the line.
[02:16:42.358 --> 02:16:43.919]  You're unintelligible.
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:44.900]  Okay.
[02:16:45.829 --> 02:16:47.170]  Can you hear me better?
[02:16:47.650 --> 02:16:48.551]  No, I can't, sir.
[02:16:48.571 --> 02:16:49.331]  Damn it!
[02:16:52.453 --> 02:16:59.778]  Yeah, the poor guy has been calling for a year and he finally got through and his phone sounded like a robot.
[02:17:00.098 --> 02:17:01.239]  Hey, just call back in.
[02:17:01.299 --> 02:17:07.983]  Go get on the landline and call into the show, sir, and we'll get you back on.
[02:17:08.023 --> 02:17:11.465]  I don't want you to not be able to get in, Bill.
[02:17:11.565 --> 02:17:12.246]  Charles and
[02:17:13.644 --> 02:17:24.928]  Paul and many others, your calls are coming up and I do have that clip of Gibson, John Gibson, throwing a fit on Fox News and another one of the Jason Burmas, the loose change boys on MSNBC today.
[02:17:25.268 --> 02:17:26.148]  We will play those.
[02:17:27.449 --> 02:17:31.610]  And I'm also going to do a news blitz.
[02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:31.970]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:32.510 --> 02:17:37.312]  Never know which great angle or informative direction our callers will take us.
[02:17:37.812 --> 02:17:40.173]  More of that on the other side.
[02:17:45.886 --> 02:17:49.029]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:49.089 --> 02:17:53.133]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:53.253 --> 02:17:55.835]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:55.895 --> 02:17:58.217]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:58.417 --> 02:18:06.845]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:06.925 --> 02:18:08.206]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:18:08.366 --> 02:18:11.709]  Water molecules take minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:11.909 --> 02:18:12.669]  We're good to go!

[02:19:04.804 --> 02:19:06.846]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.

[02:19:09.027 --> 02:19:11.108]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[02:19:38.410 --> 02:19:39.310]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:51.236 --> 02:19:56.379]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:57.375 --> 02:20:01.457]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:20:01.917 --> 02:20:10.602]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:16.725]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[02:20:28.534 --> 02:20:29.936]  It's absolutely free.
[02:20:29.956 --> 02:20:32.279]  Operators are standing by to assist you.

[02:20:45.208 --> 02:20:47.391]  By now it is no surprise that the U.S.
[02:20:47.471 --> 02:20:53.039]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:58.447]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become nutrition
[02:21:02.483 --> 02:21:02.923]  We're good to go.
[02:21:24.259 --> 02:21:24.900]  Is possible.

[02:21:45.934 --> 02:21:51.959]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:52.579 --> 02:21:55.561]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:03.467 --> 02:22:04.968]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:06.069 --> 02:22:12.854]  We're going to go to Charles and Paul and Sue and Joe and many others here in just a moment.
[02:22:12.894 --> 02:22:15.536]  But first, this was Friday.
[02:22:16.522 --> 02:22:18.764]  This was that Gibson character on Fox.
[02:22:18.844 --> 02:22:20.585]  We call him the Albino Vampire.
[02:22:22.167 --> 02:22:31.114]  And he's up there first claiming that the 9-11 conspiracy theories come from France.
[02:22:33.016 --> 02:22:33.916]  That is not true.
[02:22:36.338 --> 02:22:40.161]  The first questions of the official story were launched by me.
[02:22:42.125 --> 02:22:44.167]  And I don't care about getting the credit for that.
[02:22:44.367 --> 02:22:47.010]  It's actually a dangerous thing to hold.
[02:22:49.212 --> 02:22:53.856]  It's just they want to claim that it's the American haters in France and Canada.
[02:22:54.296 --> 02:23:04.806]  No, the heart of the 9-11 Truth Movement is not in France, it's not in Canada, it's here in the United States and it beats in my chest, it beats in your chest as listeners.
[02:23:05.774 --> 02:23:11.979]  So first he tries to act like it's the outsiders claiming this, then he claims that it's liberal Bush haters that are saying this.
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:22.188]  And even the liberal websites and Air America, who's now being forced to cover this, will tell you this stuff originated with what they call the Libertarian-slash-Patriot movement.
[02:23:22.628 --> 02:23:23.629]  And that's us again.
[02:23:25.871 --> 02:23:30.214]  And again, here is Gibson bumbling around.
[02:23:30.254 --> 02:23:30.915]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:23:31.465 --> 02:23:33.526]  Americans now believe the U.S.
[02:23:33.586 --> 02:23:36.108]  government had something to do with the 9-11 attacks.
[02:23:36.728 --> 02:23:42.291]  This madness has long been afoot among the America haters in Europe and Canada and the Arab nations.
[02:23:42.831 --> 02:23:45.853]  A best-selling book in France started it all a few years ago.
[02:23:46.293 --> 02:23:55.258]  Then another in Germany contributed to this notion that the 9-11 attacks were not the work of Osama Bin Laden, but instead, it was George W. Bush!
[02:23:56.044 --> 02:24:00.985]  This notion has gained considerable currency despite the fact that Bin Laden admitted he did it.
[02:24:01.485 --> 02:24:05.146]  Now they say, hey, the Bin Laden tapes were faked.
[02:24:05.926 --> 02:24:09.566]  They also say the Twin Towers couldn't have been brought down by the two hijacked jets.
[02:24:09.646 --> 02:24:13.667]  It must have been demolition explosives planted in the building by the U.S.
[02:24:13.687 --> 02:24:14.067]  government.
[02:24:14.567 --> 02:24:16.548]  They say the attack on the Pentagon was U.S.
[02:24:16.588 --> 02:24:18.108]  missiles, not American Flight 77.
[02:24:19.808 --> 02:24:22.229]  You say, well, then where is Flight 77?
[02:24:23.329 --> 02:24:24.829]  Where are those people who are on board?
[02:24:25.589 --> 02:24:30.736]  I have personally interviewed every major purveyor of this garbage in the world.
[02:24:31.096 --> 02:24:34.260]  None of them have an answer to the Flight 77 question.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:42.750]  Just more empty-headed questions that lead to truly sick conclusions that somehow Bush attacked his own country on 9-11.
[02:24:43.752 --> 02:24:49.798]  The truth is, people don't believe the 9-11 story because they hate George Bush and they don't believe anything he says.
[02:24:50.318 --> 02:24:52.460]  If he says Osama did it, they don't believe it.
[02:24:52.941 --> 02:24:57.164]  If he says the Twin Towers were felled by two hijacked jetliners, they don't believe it.
[02:24:57.625 --> 02:25:05.272]  If Bush says there were 19 hijackers and they took four airliners and crashed all four in the largest attack on American soil ever, they don't believe it.
[02:25:05.814 --> 02:25:12.855]  So now we have one-third of the American people as blinded by hate as many Europeans and many Canadians and many Arabs.
[02:25:13.335 --> 02:25:20.897]  So blinded they cannot see or hear the hundreds if not thousands of experts who have told them exactly what happened on 9-11.
[02:25:21.797 --> 02:25:32.399]  Instead, they rush to so-called evidence and so-called investigations that are much closer to alien spaceships than they are to observable and verifiable
[02:25:33.906 --> 02:25:37.007]  That is my... Okay, so that's his propaganda.
[02:25:37.387 --> 02:25:42.188]  It is admitted that the Bin Laden tape is a fake in Rome, looks nothing like him.
[02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:53.131]  Then major universities did voice print off of real tapes of Bin Laden, which are 100% accurate in their voice print, voice recognition.
[02:25:53.431 --> 02:25:56.432]  Then they took this Bin Laden, it wasn't the same person even close.
[02:25:56.692 --> 02:25:59.313]  Then linguists listened, it wasn't even the same dialect.
[02:25:59.813 --> 02:26:00.833]  Nice try.
[02:26:01.213 --> 02:26:03.054]  The person wasn't even from Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:04.611 --> 02:26:07.873]  Then he claims that, oh, us nuts think there were bombs in the buildings.
[02:26:08.594 --> 02:26:12.076]  He didn't mention Building 7, you noticed that, way down the street, not hit by a plane.
[02:26:12.556 --> 02:26:13.957]  Then he says, where is the plane?
[02:26:14.458 --> 02:26:16.959]  It's not our job to say where the planes are!
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:18.801]  Okay?
[02:26:19.801 --> 02:26:22.043]  And again, I don't even get into what hit the Pentagon.
[02:26:22.143 --> 02:26:30.589]  I focus on the insider trading, NORAD standing down, the CIA drills, Bin Laden being CIA, the hijackers trading U.S.
[02:26:30.609 --> 02:26:31.369]  military bases.
[02:26:31.409 --> 02:26:32.570]  You show all that,
[02:26:33.646 --> 02:26:34.687]  And then you've got them.
[02:26:34.727 --> 02:26:36.648]  You've proven it to people.
[02:26:37.189 --> 02:26:40.031]  All the little specifics of exactly how they did it, we don't know.
[02:26:40.351 --> 02:26:42.973]  Operation Northwoods gives us an idea in the official U.S.
[02:26:43.013 --> 02:26:45.975]  government plan of how to carry out a 9-11 style attack.
[02:26:46.936 --> 02:26:50.398]  Mr. Gibson, you haven't interviewed every major person.
[02:26:50.418 --> 02:26:51.559]  You have not interviewed me.
[02:26:52.599 --> 02:26:54.881]  You have not interviewed a lot of other people, you coward.
[02:26:54.901 --> 02:26:56.342]  I would dissect you.
[02:26:56.902 --> 02:26:59.084]  You little, slithering, bug-eyed nothing.
[02:26:59.867 --> 02:27:00.288]  Excuse me.
[02:27:00.528 --> 02:27:01.830]  I shouldn't get into personal attacks.
[02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:05.535]  Just such a... To watch American haters like him makes me sick.
[02:27:06.276 --> 02:27:09.760]  His boss, George Bush, is the puppet who's breaking up the U.S.
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:10.321]  right now.
[02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:11.663]  You understand the U.S.
[02:27:11.703 --> 02:27:16.930]  is going bye-bye right now, you stupid neocon, thumb-sucking bedwetters?
[02:27:18.109 --> 02:27:19.371]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's what you are.
[02:27:19.411 --> 02:27:21.313]  You're a bunch of little babies!
[02:27:21.333 --> 02:27:25.417]  You don't really love the Second Amendment like I do, and like our listeners do!
[02:27:25.878 --> 02:27:30.423]  You love thinking you're a conservative when you're a bunch of cowardly scumbags!
[02:27:32.045 --> 02:27:32.946]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.447 --> 02:27:35.049]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.970 --> 02:27:38.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.017 --> 02:27:44.738]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:27:45.118 --> 02:27:51.600]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.

[02:28:42.558 --> 02:28:51.725]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:28:51.985 --> 02:29:03.374]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[02:29:41.095 --> 02:29:45.137]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:45.358 --> 02:29:48.759]  For over 5 years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:48.939 --> 02:29:52.381]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:52.668 --> 02:29:55.910]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:55.930 --> 02:30:01.393]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:01.433 --> 02:30:11.079]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:11.199 --> 02:30:12.540]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:17.983]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:18.383 --> 02:30:24.368]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:24.528 --> 02:30:28.411]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:45.811]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:46.331 --> 02:30:49.672]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:56.314 --> 02:31:01.036]  So, the fellow on Fox talks about how we have truly sick conclusions.
[02:31:02.236 --> 02:31:05.537]  Hey, you don't want to talk about Operation Northwoods, do you, Mr. Gibson?
[02:31:06.137 --> 02:31:06.717]  On Fox.
[02:31:07.678 --> 02:31:09.938]  You don't want to talk about those hijackers trained at U.S.
[02:31:09.978 --> 02:31:11.979]  military bases being agents, confirmed.
[02:31:12.805 --> 02:31:17.726]  You don't want to talk about Tripod 2 and Building 7 and how they were running a drill that morning.
[02:31:18.246 --> 02:31:20.546]  You don't want to talk about any of it.
[02:31:21.066 --> 02:31:26.047]  You don't want to talk about Bush and the American Union, Bush and gun control, Bush and open borders.
[02:31:26.087 --> 02:31:41.190]  You want to get up there and pose as conservatives while your bosses fund the campaign of Hillary Clinton, while Bill Clinton vacations with the Bushes, that you're all a big, fat mafia trying to keep us in the dark and give us the illusion of choice!
[02:31:42.173 --> 02:31:43.633]  Well, we see through you!
[02:31:44.433 --> 02:31:47.454]  We see through the liberals, we see through you, we see through all of it!
[02:31:48.454 --> 02:31:54.756]  Now, I'm going to go to Bill, who got back from Chicago, and then Charles and everybody else, but right now, it's about four minutes long.
[02:31:55.176 --> 02:32:00.557]  This is Jason Burness of Loose Change 2nd Edition, that we, by the way, have at InfoWars.com on DVD for you.
[02:32:01.377 --> 02:32:04.958]  And this is when he finally got a chance to go on MSNBC about two hours ago.
[02:32:05.318 --> 02:32:06.018]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:32:06.933 --> 02:32:11.716]  Academy Award winning director Oliver Stone's movie World Trade Center will open on Wednesday.
[02:32:12.136 --> 02:32:20.401]  The film tells the true story of the heroic survival and rescue of two Port Authority police officers who were trapped in the rubble on 9-11.
[02:32:20.441 --> 02:32:24.304]  The film also follows their families and the rescuers who pulled them out of the debris.
[02:32:25.465 --> 02:32:33.531]  Nearly five years later, many still believe the government played some role in the attacks, according to a new Scripps Howard Ohio University poll.
[02:32:33.891 --> 02:32:44.160]  Get this, 36% of Americans suspect that federal officials assisted in the attacks, or took no action to prevent them, so that the United States could go to war in the Middle East.
[02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:44.560]  Another 16%
[02:32:46.221 --> 02:32:50.544]  Believe explosives planted in the Twin Towers helped to bring the buildings down.
[02:32:51.045 --> 02:32:56.428]  Joining us from Albany, New York is Jason Burmess from LooseChange911.com.
[02:32:56.488 --> 02:32:58.030]  Jason, welcome to MSNBC.
[02:32:59.551 --> 02:33:10.358]  You're here in part because I don't buy into any of the conspiracy theories, but I came home to dinner one night and my own 18-year-old, when this came up at dinner, said, well, have you seen Loose Change?
[02:33:10.779 --> 02:33:14.001]  What is Loose Change for those who've not yet been to your site or seen the video?
[02:33:14.728 --> 02:33:21.933]  Loose Change is basically a documentary that takes the evidence that was presented that day and in subsequent news reports that contradicts the official version.
[02:33:23.375 --> 02:33:29.459]  One of the subjects that always comes up when you talk about the conspiracy theories that surround September 11 is the Pentagon and Flight 77.
[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:39.607]  And I know that many of us have seen the imagery where you've got the hole in the side of the Pentagon and then people say, well, how could that possibly represent where an airplane struck the Pentagon?
[02:33:40.008 --> 02:33:43.731]  To which I often respond, well, where are all the people from Flight 77?
[02:33:44.531 --> 02:33:48.374]  If a missile hit the Pentagon, where in the world are all the passengers who were on Flight 77?
[02:33:49.975 --> 02:33:53.617]  Well, no one is here to disrespect the family members and say that they're off somewhere.
[02:33:53.678 --> 02:33:54.618]  We believe they're alive.
[02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:58.741]  We just happen to believe that a commercial airliner did not strike the Pentagon.
[02:33:59.041 --> 02:34:00.042]  Wait a minute.
[02:34:00.262 --> 02:34:01.022]  Perhaps I misheard.
[02:34:01.062 --> 02:34:02.263]  You believe they're alive?
[02:34:02.583 --> 02:34:03.464]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:03.504 --> 02:34:05.105]  That's why I said we don't believe they're alive.
[02:34:05.125 --> 02:34:06.386]  We obviously believe they're dead.
[02:34:06.686 --> 02:34:08.867]  We're not trying to insult any of the victim's family members.
[02:34:09.208 --> 02:34:18.494]  We're just saying that a commercial airliner piloted by Hani Hajjar did not make a 500 mile an hour turn at 330 degrees, clip five light poles, leave no debris,
[02:34:19.175 --> 02:34:22.101]  And bash into the Pentagon at the bottom floor, leaving no wreckage.
[02:34:22.522 --> 02:34:23.484]  But where is the plane?
[02:34:23.564 --> 02:34:23.845]  Area 51?
[02:34:24.526 --> 02:34:27.653]  I mean, if that airplane didn't hit the Pentagon, then where in the world is it?
[02:34:28.388 --> 02:34:34.951]  Well, it's kind of insulting that you would bring Area 51 and outrageous conspiracy theories into this when we're using physical evidence and actual news reports.
[02:34:35.331 --> 02:34:43.594]  Well, respectfully, I've just read a book published by Popular Mechanics in which they refute each and every one of these conspiracy theories that comes through in loose change.
[02:34:43.634 --> 02:34:48.656]  And I'm asking you the question, I mean, if you tell me a plane didn't hit the Pentagon, I'm asking you, where is that airplane?
[02:34:48.676 --> 02:34:50.677]  Because, frankly, I think it is disrespectful.
[02:34:50.737 --> 02:34:55.019]  I think of Deborah Burlingame, whose brother Chick Burlingame was the captain of that flight,
[02:34:55.239 --> 02:35:00.281]  I mean, you're sending a message to her that her brother didn't die in the manner that's being reported by the government.
[02:35:00.301 --> 02:35:01.221]  So how did he die?
[02:35:02.141 --> 02:35:04.302]  I think that Chick Burlingame was actually a hero.
[02:35:04.402 --> 02:35:09.023]  I mean, he actually took part in Mascow drills of ramming a commercial airliner into the Pentagon.
[02:35:09.043 --> 02:35:12.985]  And he may have been one that went public, saying we were war-gaming this prior to 9-11.
[02:35:13.365 --> 02:35:21.848]  You don't believe, sir, that the Twin Towers came down as a result of the two airplanes that struck them, but rather by virtue of some charges in addition to the airplanes.
[02:35:22.128 --> 02:35:22.828]  Is that fair to say?
[02:35:23.448 --> 02:35:24.249]  That is fair to say.
[02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:33.679]  Actually, Steven Jones from BYU has tested some of the metal steel beams and come up with thermite as what they use to actually slice them and blow the building up.
[02:35:33.819 --> 02:35:36.382]  Is there any other argument that you would raise?
[02:35:36.422 --> 02:35:37.363]  I want to be fair to you.
[02:35:37.423 --> 02:35:39.645]  I don't buy into it, but take your best shot.
[02:35:39.705 --> 02:35:44.550]  If there's an aspect of September 11 that you think people should be questioning, what exactly is it?
[02:35:45.194 --> 02:35:46.535]  Well, nothing should have struck the Pentagon.
[02:35:46.555 --> 02:35:53.597]  We have Norman Mineta's testimony that he was in a bunker with Cheney prior to it hitting, and an aide came in and said, the plane is 50 miles out.
[02:35:53.878 --> 02:35:54.698]  It's 30 miles out.
[02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:55.898]  Do the orders still stand?
[02:35:56.178 --> 02:35:58.820]  And Cheney turned his head around and said, of course the orders still stand.
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:00.120]  Did you hear anything different?
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:01.861]  And that's a direct stand-down order.
[02:36:02.201 --> 02:36:04.702]  He should have stopped whatever was going to hit the Pentagon, and he didn't.
[02:36:04.862 --> 02:36:09.544]  And that has been censored by C-SPAN and the archives, yet it is in the 9-11 Commission hearings.
[02:36:10.251 --> 02:36:10.511]  Okay.
[02:36:10.651 --> 02:36:18.656]  Loose Change 9-11 is where you can go to get that side of it and Popular Mechanics out this week with a book that refutes each and every one of those conspiracy theories.
[02:36:19.556 --> 02:36:21.057]  And it does not refute anything.
[02:36:21.137 --> 02:36:29.281]  It's pure baloney by a bunch of government apologists with the Homeland Security Director's family running the whole thing publicly.
[02:36:30.562 --> 02:36:32.103]  Has Vanity Fair even exposed?
[02:36:33.764 --> 02:36:35.384]  Jason Barmer said a really good job.
[02:36:35.424 --> 02:36:36.065]  I give him an A.
[02:36:37.412 --> 02:36:44.225]  But I would just add that when they bring this bull up that, oh, the families don't like this or how dare you make them feel sad.
[02:36:46.665 --> 02:36:47.566]  That's a red herring.
[02:36:47.606 --> 02:37:06.698]  What you do is you come back with Bill Doyle, who heads the biggest coalition of 9-11 families, who lost his son, has said on the record he believes the evidence shows it's an inside job, and the majority of the other victims' families groups have now gone public, including protesting outside the White House three separate times.
[02:37:06.938 --> 02:37:12.562]  So the families are demanding that the real murderers of their family members be exposed
[02:37:12.842 --> 02:37:19.890]  And everyone is owed the truth on 9-11 because it's being used to not just kill the people that died that day, but to kill the United States!
[02:37:20.411 --> 02:37:23.154]  So don't you try that to use those dead people!
[02:37:23.655 --> 02:37:31.384]  Now that's how you handle one of those scumbag little government pimps when they try that stuff with you.
[02:37:33.414 --> 02:37:36.955]  And then, of course, when they bring up where did the plane go, you go, I don't know, the official U.S.
[02:37:36.975 --> 02:37:44.878]  government plan to carry out 9-11 Operation Northwood says they would stage people getting on the planes, then land, get them off, take the planes back off, and then blow them up.
[02:37:44.958 --> 02:37:45.398]  I don't know!
[02:37:45.598 --> 02:37:46.518]  Let's go off the U.S.
[02:37:46.538 --> 02:37:47.619]  government document!
[02:37:49.459 --> 02:37:52.400]  I want them to put me on MSNBC, I want them to put me on FOX.
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:54.081]  I mean, I don't contact them, I don't call them.
[02:37:54.781 --> 02:37:57.902]  I hardly even call them back now when they call, because I've been through it over and over again.
[02:37:57.922 --> 02:38:01.683]  Now, they call up, and
[02:38:02.546 --> 02:38:03.647]  We want to have you on.
[02:38:03.667 --> 02:38:05.568]  And then I go, OK, sure.
[02:38:05.588 --> 02:38:06.848]  And then they go to their boss.
[02:38:06.868 --> 02:38:08.169]  Their boss says, Alex Jones?
[02:38:08.189 --> 02:38:09.149]  No way!
[02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:14.512]  And it's not that I'm even that good on TV.
[02:38:16.533 --> 02:38:19.815]  They just know that I am going to hit them on the areas they don't want to be hit.
[02:38:20.715 --> 02:38:23.737]  Bin Laden being a known CIA asset, the hijackers training U.S.
[02:38:23.757 --> 02:38:31.421]  military bases, bombs in the buildings, Building 7, the NORAD stand down, Cheney in the bunker, some of the stuff Burma's hit,
[02:38:33.582 --> 02:38:34.063]  C.I.A.
[02:38:34.123 --> 02:38:35.265]  insider trading, U.S.
[02:38:35.285 --> 02:38:40.753]  troops massed overseas, the PNAC documents, and then just keep rolling from there.
[02:38:40.933 --> 02:38:41.694]  The C.I.A.
[02:38:41.714 --> 02:38:42.195]  drills.
[02:38:43.775 --> 02:38:49.037]  And when the host tries to always go back to the Pentagon, the Pentagon, notice they instinctively go to it.
[02:38:49.317 --> 02:38:50.937]  They always have.
[02:38:51.257 --> 02:38:52.398]  They always will.
[02:38:52.698 --> 02:38:58.940]  For some reason, as I point out in my film, Terror Storm, we cover the whole Pentagon controversy.
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:07.022]  And yes, Paul Watson and Steve Watson have been spending the last six months writing a book titled, The Pentagon Controversy.
[02:39:07.542 --> 02:39:08.782]  It'll be out in a few months.
[02:39:09.023 --> 02:39:10.303]  It's going to go to press here in the next
[02:39:10.863 --> 02:39:11.463]  It'll be this time.
[02:39:39.079 --> 02:39:40.079]  Can you hear me now?
[02:39:40.159 --> 02:39:40.939]  Yes, I can, sir.
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:41.720]  Great.
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:46.101]  First of all, I want to say thank you very much for waking me up three years ago with this.
[02:39:46.501 --> 02:39:46.901]  Excellent.
[02:39:47.401 --> 02:39:49.121]  I recommend everybody to see it.
[02:39:49.141 --> 02:39:53.743]  It is nothing but fact-filled information that you did an excellent job on.
[02:39:54.503 --> 02:39:57.924]  Two things that I wanted to talk to you about real quickly.
[02:39:58.124 --> 02:40:02.165]  One is, two weeks ago, you mentioned about the guy tagging U.S.
[02:40:02.665 --> 02:40:03.725]  Air Force One.
[02:40:04.785 --> 02:40:06.786]  Now it's come out that he didn't really do that, I think.
[02:40:07.286 --> 02:40:07.566]  Yes.
[02:40:09.053 --> 02:40:15.137]  It's all staged that they bought the plane and did that, so I didn't know if you knew that or not.
[02:40:15.297 --> 02:40:23.521]  I'm also a key player for you because I'm in Naperville, which happens to be right next to Dennis Hassert's office.
[02:40:24.022 --> 02:40:29.305]  So if you need any help with Dennis Hassert, please feel free to contact me.
[02:40:29.705 --> 02:40:34.248]  I've emailed you several, several times, but I understand you're a busy man.
[02:40:35.088 --> 02:40:36.609]  I wanted to tell you, though,
[02:40:37.239 --> 02:40:44.964]  Is I took the FBI document that claims people are terrorists down to my municipal building.
[02:40:45.004 --> 02:40:46.345]  Your phone's going bad again.
[02:40:46.385 --> 02:40:47.426]  You're going to need to move quick.
[02:40:48.166 --> 02:40:48.446]  Okay.
[02:40:49.267 --> 02:41:00.294]  I took down the FBI, that FBI manual thing to my municipal building and I explained to them, I showed them on there that anybody that upholds the Constitution is considered a terrorist.
[02:41:01.475 --> 02:41:04.817]  That is when it got through their oath and I went up to the mayor's office
[02:41:05.279 --> 02:41:09.228]  And I said, see, because you signed yourself, they're considering you a terrorist.
[02:41:09.709 --> 02:41:15.281]  Believe it or not, they got two security guards to escort me out of the building because they said that I was stealing that.
[02:41:16.698 --> 02:41:30.786]  They said it was scary that you brought them an official FBI training document where they said that Constitutionalists are terrorists, those that make frequent references to the Constitution are terrorists, and because you were talking about tyranny in this country, it scared them and they threw you out.
[02:41:31.046 --> 02:41:38.171]  You see, that's desperate to stay with their heads in the sand, just like the Germans were desperate to deny what was going on all around them under Hitler.
[02:41:38.491 --> 02:41:39.191]  Good to hear from you.
[02:41:39.211 --> 02:41:40.272]  I appreciate the call.
[02:41:41.204 --> 02:41:44.745]  And I had my big call list here and it's now been wiped clean.
[02:41:44.805 --> 02:41:46.565]  I can't find my caller.
[02:41:48.326 --> 02:41:50.246]  Charles in Alabama, you're on the air.
[02:41:50.286 --> 02:41:50.927]  Thanks for holding.
[02:41:52.067 --> 02:41:52.607]  Yes, Alex.
[02:41:53.207 --> 02:41:58.609]  I've been listening to your program two or three years on the internet.
[02:41:58.809 --> 02:42:02.970]  I can't get it on TV, I mean on the news here on television.
[02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:04.250]  It's just on the internet.
[02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:07.171]  But I wanted to mention that there's
[02:42:08.755 --> 02:42:10.496]  In the Bible, this is Daniel Chapter 8.
[02:42:10.596 --> 02:42:14.097]  It's happening in Iran and going to happen in Iraq.
[02:42:15.318 --> 02:42:23.301]  And most of the people miss it because the people that teach prophecy miss it because they think Daniel Chapter 8 was Alexander the Great.
[02:42:24.261 --> 02:42:31.644]  But verse 5, verse 16 and 17, 19 and 20, shows you that it wasn't Alexander the Great.
[02:42:33.045 --> 02:42:35.526]  It mentions there the kings of
[02:42:36.642 --> 02:42:43.928]  The he-goat, I mean the ram's horns, two horns on the ram are the kings of Media and Persia, which is the day I ran in Iraq.
[02:42:45.029 --> 02:42:50.313]  The he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and ran into them and broke them in pieces.
[02:42:51.574 --> 02:42:53.296]  The he-goat says he's the king of Grisha.
[02:42:53.956 --> 02:42:56.398]  Grisha is not Greece.
[02:42:56.518 --> 02:42:58.200]  Grisha came from the word Javin.
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:01.983]  Greece came from the word Hellas, you see.
[02:43:05.339 --> 02:43:20.808]  The he-goat that came from the west, we're the only people in history that's ever came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and ran into that area of the world.
[02:43:21.528 --> 02:43:25.110]  And we've already broken up Iraq and we're going to break up Iran.
[02:43:25.330 --> 02:43:26.711]  Yeah, it's saying flew in there.
[02:43:28.852 --> 02:43:29.232]  Did what?
[02:43:30.053 --> 02:43:34.155]  I mean, I guess that means flew into the region without touching our foot to the ground.
[02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:47.419]  They flew into that area, yeah, and it says they'll run into the ram with the two horns, which is Iran and Iraq, today, and break them in pieces.
[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:51.161]  Then it says the he-goat will become great.
[02:43:51.601 --> 02:43:57.805]  The he-goat is George Bush, the leader of Grisha, which is us, actually.
[02:43:58.485 --> 02:44:02.067]  Now it takes a lot of, there's some other things in the scriptures that verify that.
[02:44:05.646 --> 02:44:10.910]  When he becomes great, then it says the great horn is broken.
[02:44:12.911 --> 02:44:16.574]  Then it says four powers will come up out of the nation, but not in his power.
[02:44:16.614 --> 02:44:21.197]  Those four powers that come up will be the four world unions coming up now.
[02:44:22.739 --> 02:44:27.682]  And then it says out of one of the four comes forth a little horn, which is the Antichrist.
[02:44:27.862 --> 02:44:30.785]  And we know the Antichrist will come out of Europe and so on.
[02:44:32.096 --> 02:44:34.537]  Put people on track on this thing and prophecy.
[02:44:34.597 --> 02:44:35.737]  It is Daniel chapter 8.
[02:44:35.777 --> 02:44:37.178]  It's the beginning.
[02:44:37.778 --> 02:44:39.919]  His verses 3 and 4 of Daniel chapter 11.
[02:44:39.959 --> 02:44:43.200]  And then it'll continue on from there.
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:46.261]  And like you've been telling people, this is not going to stop.
[02:44:46.361 --> 02:44:48.542]  It won't stop till they face Christ.
[02:44:49.862 --> 02:44:51.082]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:44:51.122 --> 02:44:51.943]  Good to hear from you.
[02:44:52.963 --> 02:44:53.663]  Who's up next?
[02:44:55.184 --> 02:44:56.484]  Paul in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:44:56.504 --> 02:44:57.104]  You're on the air.
[02:44:57.985 --> 02:45:01.226]  Alex, I'm just wondering if you've covered
[02:45:04.284 --> 02:45:06.725]  It's the Israeli Supreme Court in Jerusalem.
[02:45:07.606 --> 02:45:08.286]  Have you covered that?
[02:45:09.166 --> 02:45:10.647]  Well, they've had a lot of rulings there.
[02:45:11.187 --> 02:45:12.648]  What specifically are you talking about?
[02:45:12.928 --> 02:45:17.351]  Well, basically, if you go on to Google Earth, you can find the PlaySpark on the Google Earth community site.
[02:45:17.371 --> 02:45:19.512]  Oh, you mean how it's a giant, all-seeing-eye pyramid?
[02:45:20.092 --> 02:45:20.492]  Exactly.
[02:45:20.512 --> 02:45:22.613]  I mean, that just struck my mind.
[02:45:22.893 --> 02:45:25.775]  They want that to be their world court.
[02:45:26.619 --> 02:45:31.021]  That's where they want Israel to be the governing state of the world.
[02:45:31.481 --> 02:45:40.444]  It just occurred to me after seeing that, after seeing the Illuminati all-seeing eye on top of their buildings and their Masonic designs and whatnot.
[02:45:40.464 --> 02:45:44.866]  Yeah, if you had anything else to say, I have one more comment.
[02:45:44.906 --> 02:45:52.649]  Well, they told the Christians that worshiping Israel is the thing to do, so when they got a guy in a fancy gold robe up there, they're going to fall down and think it's Jesus.
[02:45:53.753 --> 02:45:57.434]  Well yeah, that just struck my mind.
[02:45:57.474 --> 02:46:01.756]  That's their actual mandate is to set up the New World Order centrally in Israel.
[02:46:02.216 --> 02:46:15.180]  My second point is, I've talked to somebody who knows the stuff on 9-11, and he told me that a lot of those people that were killed in the Pentagon were actually planning a coup against the Bush Admin.
[02:46:16.581 --> 02:46:37.415]  Yeah, I've heard that it was Naval Intelligence that got hit, that it was releasing documents on the trillions that were missing, which admittedly, Associated Press, trillions are missing, that was breaking in the week before 9-11, they were all about to go to jail, and then magically there's a huge terror attack they already had all lined up, but as for what was Naval Intelligence doing, I don't know.
[02:46:37.435 --> 02:46:41.978]  Okay, so I just wanted to bring those up, also I just wanted to plug a site, it's not
[02:46:42.937 --> 02:46:45.659]  It's called coughwatch.org.
[02:46:46.099 --> 02:46:47.460]  That's a good website.
[02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:50.382]  Post people's videos and photos from all over the country.
[02:46:51.203 --> 02:46:55.285]  Yeah, so I just wanted to plug that in for the common population.
[02:46:55.465 --> 02:46:56.086]  Well, good job.
[02:46:56.106 --> 02:46:58.107]  I appreciate your call from Canada, my friend.
[02:46:58.487 --> 02:46:59.988]  Sue in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:47:00.048 --> 02:47:00.529]  Go ahead.
[02:47:00.549 --> 02:47:01.870]  Hello?
[02:47:02.110 --> 02:47:02.450]  Hi.
[02:47:03.090 --> 02:47:03.391]  Alex?
[02:47:03.691 --> 02:47:04.011]  Yes.
[02:47:04.571 --> 02:47:05.472]  You're my hero.
[02:47:05.872 --> 02:47:06.913]  I'm here in Houston.
[02:47:07.702 --> 02:47:12.984]  And I gotta tell you that Tom Martino is going to have a show here again, live.
[02:47:13.865 --> 02:47:22.129]  And he, this morning, mentioned that he wants people to call in if they have any... You don't have your radio on, do you?
[02:47:22.149 --> 02:47:23.309]  It's in the other room.
[02:47:23.729 --> 02:47:25.470]  It's really tough on us folks.
[02:47:25.490 --> 02:47:27.531]  We want to hear what you have to say so bad.
[02:47:27.731 --> 02:47:28.311]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:30.672]  But at the same time, you gotta turn radios off.
[02:47:30.692 --> 02:47:31.473]  Okay, I'm in the other room.
[02:47:31.953 --> 02:47:34.194]  So he was saying that if people have any
[02:47:34.861 --> 02:47:35.501]  I don't know.
[02:47:47.890 --> 02:47:52.553]  I'm very excited about that because this gives me the opportunity to call into his show.
[02:47:52.633 --> 02:48:02.759]  Yeah, you know, I was on his show last week and the producers said they were going to call me today and set me up for like an hour or two.
[02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:03.960]  So I know Kevin's listening.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.040]  Kevin, go ahead and make that call.
[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:06.001]  That was something I was forgetting.
[02:48:08.942 --> 02:48:10.643]  Did you interview him already?
[02:48:11.024 --> 02:48:11.664]  No, no, no, no.
[02:48:11.984 --> 02:48:13.105]  He had me on his show.
[02:48:14.082 --> 02:48:14.642]  Oh, okay.
[02:48:15.043 --> 02:48:18.005]  You know, the problem is that we're only going to get him for one hour.
[02:48:18.866 --> 02:48:21.388]  And I don't know if they'll be able to get your whole interview.
[02:48:22.869 --> 02:48:37.880]  Probably not, but the good news is, is that Tom Martino is a pretty well-respected, pretty smart guy, and he's leaning towards 9-11 being an inside job now, and lets me go on air and expose it and agrees with me, so, again, more good news.
[02:48:45.223 --> 02:48:45.704]  It's here!
[02:48:45.924 --> 02:48:50.708]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:51.068 --> 02:48:58.734]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.415 --> 02:49:06.460]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:13.706]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:14.235 --> 02:49:18.296]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.576 --> 02:49:22.077]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.557 --> 02:49:24.458]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:24.798 --> 02:49:28.699]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:43.601 --> 02:49:44.643]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:44.963 --> 02:49:47.747]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:48.027 --> 02:49:52.173]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:52.614 --> 02:49:53.455]  So what do you do?
[02:49:53.755 --> 02:49:58.322]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:49:58.803 --> 02:50:00.924]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:01.425 --> 02:50:16.115]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:50:43.268 --> 02:50:43.588]  I think so.
[02:50:58.493 --> 02:50:59.154]  We're good to go!
[02:51:28.012 --> 02:51:31.114]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:31.274 --> 02:51:37.237]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:46.942 --> 02:51:55.807]  Welcome back, final segment.
[02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:58.321]  Great broadcast today.
[02:51:58.341 --> 02:52:08.824]  I just got time to talk to Joe and Jeff, but in closing before I do that, if you live in Dallas or surrounding areas in the Metroplex, please come to our event.
[02:52:08.884 --> 02:52:09.625]  It's going to be great.
[02:52:09.645 --> 02:52:10.325]  We're inviting you.
[02:52:10.345 --> 02:52:11.145]  We want to see you there.
[02:52:11.185 --> 02:52:12.946]  We'll premiere my new film, Terror Storm.
[02:52:13.809 --> 02:52:18.133]  I am also going to have Professor Jim Mars there giving a speech, JFK at 9-11.
[02:52:18.233 --> 02:52:25.739]  Then I'll show video that we shot up at the Bilderberg Group Conference, close-ups of David Rockefeller and all of it, the whole nine yards.
[02:52:26.339 --> 02:52:28.161]  That is coming up, my friends!
[02:52:30.182 --> 02:52:31.964]  That is coming up in Dallas.
[02:52:32.791 --> 02:52:33.912]  Hi, can you hear me?
[02:52:34.012 --> 02:52:34.692]  Yes, I can.
[02:52:34.752 --> 02:52:35.152]  A couple points.
[02:52:35.192 --> 02:52:39.434]  A week or two ago, you had a guy mention a C-SPAN show that was like two and a half hours long.
[02:53:00.885 --> 02:53:06.268]  Bernanke was being talked to and talked about the people in London being on the board.
[02:53:06.288 --> 02:53:13.992]  Yeah, well it's well known that our country is foreign owned to the banking system and it's private and then it was just Bernanke admitting it on C-SPAN.
[02:53:14.312 --> 02:53:20.996]  Well the whole thing was actually interesting to watch and I think it looked very staged actually all of the comments and concerns they voiced.
[02:53:21.156 --> 02:53:25.238]  I did get a copy of that as an AVI file if you are still looking for it.
[02:53:25.971 --> 02:53:31.014]  Yeah, I don't know if I got it in the mail yet, so why don't you go ahead and email it to us at tipsandinfowars.com.
[02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:32.275]  Well, it's a huge file.
[02:53:32.315 --> 02:53:33.816]  It's like a 1.1 meg.
[02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:34.937]  Can you burn it on a disk?
[02:53:35.277 --> 02:53:38.519]  I can put it on at least a couple of CDs if you can put it back together.
[02:53:38.539 --> 02:53:41.361]  That would be absolutely fabulous, sir.
[02:53:42.274 --> 02:53:44.995]  Tennis is a 3000 Lamar one.
[02:53:45.255 --> 02:53:50.397]  Yes sir, 3001 South Lamar, suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:53:50.937 --> 02:53:57.439]  Okay, the other point is I'm running for Secretary of State in Kansas on the Reform Party ticket.
[02:53:57.679 --> 02:53:58.099]  Oh good!
[02:53:58.319 --> 02:54:00.740]  And one of my big issues is indeed vote fraud.
[02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:06.882]  And the Kansas Secretary of State currently, Ron Thornberry, he's really pushing electronic voting machines.
[02:54:06.942 --> 02:54:08.082]  Of course they are, yeah.
[02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:12.702]  And they've had some interesting surprises, I think, in this primary.
[02:54:12.742 --> 02:54:15.524]  And of course, they have lots of electronic voting machines now.
[02:54:16.985 --> 02:54:23.488]  Yeah, I mean, never before would you have somebody 15 points behind in the polls, but they magically win because they're the establishment candidate.
[02:54:23.848 --> 02:54:24.669]  Out of time, Joe.
[02:54:24.689 --> 02:54:25.949]  We'd love it if you'd send that to us.
[02:54:25.989 --> 02:54:26.450]  Thank you.
[02:54:26.930 --> 02:54:28.051]  Jeff in Michigan.
[02:54:28.091 --> 02:54:28.631]  Last caller.
[02:54:28.671 --> 02:54:29.311]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:54:29.872 --> 02:54:30.372]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:30.972 --> 02:54:35.955]  I'm calling in for the NCLEX examination for student nurses.
[02:54:36.936 --> 02:54:41.257]  If anybody's been failing this, we have a website called SoCanon.com.
[02:54:41.817 --> 02:54:56.242]  It's the test that's being written by the psychometricians and a lot of anonymous nursing students are telling me that they can't even understand the questions that are being asked on the computer adaptive testing for state licenses.
[02:54:56.842 --> 02:54:57.062]  Okay.
[02:54:57.122 --> 02:54:59.122]  Alright, that's interesting.
[02:54:59.242 --> 02:55:00.803]  A show about testing tips.
[02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:04.351]  I think that's one of the more interesting statements and plugs I've gotten.
[02:55:04.791 --> 02:55:12.994]  Well, what's happening is in this computer-adaptive testing, it's going across the CPAs, accountants, massage therapists, you name it.
[02:55:13.374 --> 02:55:16.275]  And I think it's going to get to the point that if you... Oh, I understand.
[02:55:16.315 --> 02:55:21.216]  They're centralizing certification nationwide... There you go.
[02:55:21.236 --> 02:55:23.757]  ...with a federally... Oh, that's big, yeah.
[02:55:24.097 --> 02:55:25.378]  I knew that was going on, yeah.
[02:55:25.518 --> 02:55:26.418]  How about DARPA?
[02:55:26.886 --> 02:55:30.635]  Is DARPA putting money into preschoolers for computer-adaptive testing?
[02:55:30.935 --> 02:55:31.577]  Yes, they are.
[02:55:31.998 --> 02:55:32.980]  Okay, so can it.
[02:55:33.365 --> 02:55:34.545]  SoCanada.com.
[02:55:34.585 --> 02:55:35.666]  We've got some information.
[02:55:35.726 --> 02:55:36.486]  I'll send you some more.
[02:55:36.906 --> 02:55:37.366]  Thank you.
[02:55:38.507 --> 02:55:38.987]  I plead.
[02:55:39.047 --> 02:55:39.887]  I was ignorant at first.
[02:55:39.947 --> 02:55:41.468]  I didn't get what you were saying.
[02:55:41.488 --> 02:55:45.289]  I thought you were just plugging a site about how to pass some exam.
[02:55:45.369 --> 02:55:48.110]  I was going, man, this is a weird call.
[02:55:48.390 --> 02:55:48.990]  Now I understand.
[02:55:49.010 --> 02:55:50.550]  You know, that's how they centralize everything.
[02:55:50.851 --> 02:55:56.052]  The same centralized tests are being given in New Zealand, England, Canada, Australia, the U.S.
[02:55:56.692 --> 02:55:58.273]  It's all leaving the same names.
