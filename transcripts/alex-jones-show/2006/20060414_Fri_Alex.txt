[00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:06.323]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:08.064]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:09.865]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:11.346]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:12.987]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:17.311]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.974]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:31.241]  Coming up in the next hour, joining us from Europe is Dr. Daniel Ganzer.
[00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:46.633]  He's an expert in geo-strategy and security, secret warfare, business and human rights, peace research, and of course, I can't even tell you about some of his titles and some of the work he does as a condition of the interviews.
[00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:49.295]  I mean, that's how high level this gentleman is.
[00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:57.263]  And he's written a book several years ago, NATO's Secret Army, Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.
[00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:01.586]  Contemporary Security Studies, paperback.
[00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.827]  We'll be getting into his book today.
[00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:07.728]  Operation Gladio.
[00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:14.450]  Western governments carrying out terror attacks, staging terror attacks, hiring provocateurs, you name it.
[00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.551]  It's all coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:24.533]  In the meantime, our plate is extremely full on this live Friday edition.
[00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:29.981]  UK soldier jailed for refusing to go to Iraq.
[00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:38.548]  The doctor, RFA doctor, jailed for refusal to go to Iraq.
[00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:43.992]  And we'll get into this report and some of the quotes and some of the things that he is saying.
[00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:49.055]  Royal Air Force doctor arrested, tried, convicted.
[00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:52.558]  He's going to spend, what, eight months in the stockade.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.842]  Also, Texas stops arresting drunks in bars.
[00:01:57.402 --> 00:02:01.324]  Operation Last Call program suspended after public outcry.
[00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:16.633]  This is good news, showing that standing up against the insane police state can have an effect, but it dovetails with the police before someone had even been indicted or tried for drug charges, trying to rip their gold caps out of their teeth.
[00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:21.816]  I mean, again, in Nazi Germany, they waited until you were dead to do such things.
[00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.576]  And then we have other police state activities I want to cover.
[00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:27.457]  Random weapon scans in New York City schools.
[00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:30.438]  More Britons have DNA held by police in the rest of the world.
[00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.359]  And how it dovetails with several other reports.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.622]  New developments with all the illegal aliens and the staged protests and demonstrations around the country.
[00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:48.845]  We'll be getting into that and we'll open the phones up for you to join us on air.
[00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:53.963]  Early in this first hour, as we did yesterday.
[00:02:53.983 --> 00:03:03.808]  Any news item, any story, any issue, any question, any comment, whatever you'd like to discuss, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.970]  By the way, I'm very proud of two websites that don't get enough promotion.
[00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:24.872]  And that's JonesReport.com that we developed five years ago and just let sit there for a future development.
[00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:31.917]  Now has been updated daily for about a month or a little less than a month and it's got a lot of original material on it.
[00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:34.038]  It's also a quick download page.
[00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:42.024]  It's not as big or hard to download as some of our other juggernaut websites like Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:54.614]  And it's got a lot of original materials and reports that originate solely from its ISP, its domain registry number and its ISP.
[00:03:56.155 --> 00:04:02.217]  So it's all there for you at JonesReport.com and also InfoWars.net run by Steve Watson and Dwayne Coogs.
[00:04:02.337 --> 00:04:08.020]  It's excellent and has a lot of reports weekly that originate directly from it that are exclusive, I should say.
[00:04:09.072 --> 00:04:10.372]  to InfoWars.net.
[00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:16.234]  We're very proud of the work of Steve Watson as well, so be sure and check that out.
[00:04:16.634 --> 00:04:19.874]  There's going to be some big new 9-11 developments this weekend.
[00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:33.977]  I can't tell you what those developments are going to be, but you can tell I get pleasure out of lancing the New World Order boils, and this is definitely a big lancing that's going to happen.
[00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:36.178]  I enjoy exposing corruption.
[00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:37.738]  It is my opiate.
[00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:40.607]  It is my love.
[00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:42.687]  I'm in love with the truth.
[00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:45.388]  I'm in love with smashing the New World Order.
[00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:48.750]  And I know you share that same love.
[00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.551]  Almost, almost lust, but that's not a good word to use for it.
[00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:54.752]  That's the feeling I have.
[00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:55.992]  A lust.
[00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.193]  A burning desire for the truth.
[00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:02.944]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:06.186]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:10.228]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:14.511]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:18.633]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.773 --> 00:05:20.714]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.774 --> 00:05:24.096]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:25.197]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.898 --> 00:05:28.820]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.044]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:35.067]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:41.674]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:45.997]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:47.758]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.178 --> 00:05:49.159]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.460]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.961]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:02.665]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:06.907]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:09.908]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.988 --> 00:06:16.712]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.892 --> 00:06:19.893]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.495]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:27.337]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:36.844]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:42.107]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:48.892]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Blank Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.163]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:07:04.603 --> 00:07:08.746]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:16.672]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:21.082]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:07:21.463 --> 00:07:34.914]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:07:35.334 --> 00:07:38.697]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of stem enhancers.
[00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:43.353]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.636]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:07:46.797 --> 00:07:47.277]  Call me.
[00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:50.100]  Dr. Patricia Margitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.101]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:08:02.032 --> 00:08:07.635]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:28.768]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the second segment.
[00:08:28.788 --> 00:08:30.809]  We're now into the Friday edition.
[00:08:32.148 --> 00:08:39.531]  Dr. Daniel Ganzer will be joining us coming up in the next hour to talk about U.S.
[00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:51.857]  government and European terror attacks from the 1950s, 60s, 70s into the 80s crowned by things like the Bologna bombing killing over a hundred people that were blamed on their political enemies.
[00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:54.198]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.360]  Let me just plunge right into the news right now.
[00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:03.268]  UK soldier jailed for refusing to go to Iraq.
[00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:12.131]  A British Air Force doctor who refused to go to Iraq was jailed for eight months on Thursday after being found guilty by a court-martial of disobeying orders.
[00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:19.433]  Australian-born Malcolm Kendall Smith refused to go to Iraq in 2005, arguing the war was a crime.
[00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:28.055]  The judge ruled that the British presence in Iraq was legal and told the five officer panel acting as a jury to ignore the officer's arguments.
[00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:31.637]  The case is the first of its kind in Britain over the war in Iraq.
[00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:44.004]  Sat motionless as the president of the panel pronounced him guilty of five counts, one for refusing to go to Iraq and four for refusing to train and prepare.
[00:09:44.164 --> 00:09:50.170]  Kendall Smith's lawyer Phillip Samsford described him to the court as a man of great moral courage.
[00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:59.038]  And I would add to this that we were in contact with his lawyer yesterday and trying to get
[00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:01.105]  Can't get him on.
[00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:02.265]  Can't get Mr. Smith on.
[00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:03.186]  He's in the stockade.
[00:10:03.226 --> 00:10:04.506]  But get his lawyer on.
[00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:09.469]  And if it doesn't happen in the third hour today, it should be happening sometime early for you next week.
[00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.710]  And I'm looking for it.
[00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.951]  I printed this.
[00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:14.832]  It was a second and third page.
[00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.413]  And I don't see his comments.
[00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:19.895]  I guess you've got to love printers sometimes.
[00:10:19.915 --> 00:10:22.556]  Because when you print, it'll print just the first page.
[00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:23.396]  I should have noticed that.
[00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:25.738]  People say, well, then why are you using a printer, buddy?
[00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:26.458]  You've got a computer.
[00:10:27.088 --> 00:10:38.399]  Because if you try to skip around between sometimes a hundred stories on the computer, the computer will freeze up or you can't get to your document in the stack as we call it in talk radio.
[00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:42.083]  But, oh, I think I printed it twice.
[00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:47.969]  So let me now bumble about here on air and get to it.
[00:10:49.213 --> 00:10:50.614]  I think I did find his quotes.
[00:10:50.694 --> 00:11:01.037]  Kendall told the military hearing that he refused to serve in Basra, Iraq last July because he did not want to be complicit with an act of aggression contrary to international law.
[00:11:01.117 --> 00:11:06.518]  He said, I have evidence that the Americans were on par with Nazi Germany with his actions in the Persian Gulf.
[00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:08.559]  I have documents in my possession which support my
[00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:20.642]  Assertions, this is on the basis of that, on ongoing acts of aggression in Iraq and systematically applied war crimes provide a moral equivalent between the US and Nazi Germany.
[00:11:21.662 --> 00:11:38.367]  And then he went on to say, I paraphrase, I'm having trouble finding it, he said the Ministry of Defense's actions in convicting me only reaffirm what I already knew and that he is basically very pleased now to serve eight months in prison for what he believes in.
[00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:46.647]  So, let me just dovetail this with what happened three weeks ago.
[00:11:48.229 --> 00:12:06.105]  One of the top men, he's an officer, in special air services for decades, as highly decorated as it gets, with the highest marks the BBC reported, and the London Telegraph reported, we wrote articles about it, that you can get.
[00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:08.387]  He is a soldier's soldier.
[00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.051]  Contrary to what you hear, the Mossad are not the best.
[00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:14.191]  The Delta Force is not the best.
[00:12:14.611 --> 00:12:16.431]  The Navy SEALs are not the best.
[00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:19.572]  They are all modeled off of SAS.
[00:12:19.612 --> 00:12:21.992]  And I've actually studied Special Forces history.
[00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.672]  I have a lot of friends in Special Forces.
[00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:28.833]  They will tell you no one has the success rate of Special Air Services.
[00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:30.534]  They are the best.
[00:12:30.554 --> 00:12:35.054]  It's basically a bunch of military James Bonds is what they are.
[00:12:35.074 --> 00:12:38.435]  And then the James Bond type characters are recruited out of SAS.
[00:12:40.114 --> 00:12:54.099]  And he said that we are engaging in murder, we are engaging in crimes, we are stirring up crises on purpose, and he'd already been there for three years in the most heavy combat they've seen.
[00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.620]  He was in on the invasion.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.980]  He was in throughout.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:04.003]  And he said, the Americans are engaging in crimes every day, and I'm being forced to aid and abet them.
[00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:07.604]  And he said, I am not going to be part of this.
[00:13:09.218 --> 00:13:15.480]  And the Ministry of Defense then, you can go read the articles, said, oh, we really respect a top soldier of his nature.
[00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:18.461]  No, we're not going to be arresting him as he thinks he is.
[00:13:18.702 --> 00:13:19.822]  We want to speak with him.
[00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:36.008]  See, they didn't want to make a martyr out of this guy, but they took this doctor, Mr. Smith, Dr. Smith, who has a medical degree, medical doctor, and he also has a top PhD in philosophy,
[00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:44.171]  And his philosophy professors are coming out and saying that his dissertation was one of the best PhDs in philosophy they'd ever seen.
[00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:47.951]  And by the way, his dissertation was on good and evil.
[00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:54.353]  And saying, contrary to what Nietzsche and others said, that there is good and evil.
[00:13:55.433 --> 00:13:57.813]  So he has a PhD in good and evil.
[00:13:58.593 --> 00:14:01.054]  He has a medical doctorate as well.
[00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:06.535]  And he researched the war and he said, I'm not going.
[00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:11.180]  I joined the military because I was naive and thought we were going to fight evil.
[00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:13.562]  Post 9-11.
[00:14:14.443 --> 00:14:18.647]  And then he found out, of course, that the war was a fraud and the whole thing was a scam.
[00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:22.671]  He's another Pat Tillman but a smarter Pat Tillman.
[00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:24.913]  He went and he joined
[00:14:28.194 --> 00:14:31.436]  By the way, he's already been a university professor on top of it.
[00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:36.620]  So, I mean, you cannot really be more, have more letters in front of your name than Dr. Smith.
[00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.603]  And again, when we got a break here in a few minutes, I'll look through my articles.
[00:14:41.643 --> 00:14:43.144]  I can't find his quotes here.
[00:14:43.164 --> 00:14:45.066]  I want to get four of them here.
[00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:57.254]  I want to find the quote and read the quote that he had to say, that he had to say about this because
[00:14:58.459 --> 00:15:03.843]  It is so vitally important that we understand the moral stand people are taking.
[00:15:04.243 --> 00:15:07.525]  By the way, remember three weeks ago it was on Fox News.
[00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:09.526]  He's a contributor there, not for long.
[00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.067]  He's one of their analysts.
[00:15:11.748 --> 00:15:13.989]  He was also on CBS Nightly News.
[00:15:15.971 --> 00:15:16.431]  Check that.
[00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:18.332]  He was on one of the CBS Sunday News shows.
[00:15:20.013 --> 00:15:22.755]  And he also first gave the interview in LA Weekly.
[00:15:25.874 --> 00:15:28.516]  One of the founders of Delta Force.
[00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:37.884]  And he said, in fact we're going to write another article on this, but we wrote an article about the SAS officer and the Delta Force founder.
[00:15:39.485 --> 00:15:44.149]  He's founding commander, the founder from Austin, Texas and died a few years ago, but he's the founding commander.
[00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:48.593]  The person that first commanded Delta Force.
[00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:52.596]  And he went public and said the war is staged.
[00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:55.918]  We are stirring up crises on purpose.
[00:15:56.358 --> 00:15:58.600]  He said the war on terror isn't real.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.482]  No real country threatens us.
[00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:01.863]  The war on terror is bogus.
[00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:05.745]  To paraphrase, he even said things more hardcore than that.
[00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:10.929]  And again, just go read the articles on InfoWars.com and on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.312]  Or in LA Weekly or Fox News or wherever you wish.
[00:16:14.652 --> 00:16:15.833]  They all put stories out on it.
[00:16:17.432 --> 00:16:27.757]  These are top SAS officers, top Delta Force officers, RAF, again, Royal Air Force doctors.
[00:16:27.997 --> 00:16:30.638]  These are the creme de la creme of the military.
[00:16:30.938 --> 00:16:34.320]  What, in the last week, two former Iraq U.S.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:43.104]  generals at the highest levels have gone public, saying Rumsfeld needs to resign, we're stirring up crises, it's insane that they want to attack Iran.
[00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:48.987]  And these individuals, almost universally, are conservatives.
[00:16:49.048 --> 00:16:49.848]  They're hawks.
[00:16:50.849 --> 00:16:54.671]  You go look at their records, they're pro-gun, pro-America.
[00:16:55.352 --> 00:16:56.973]  You don't get any more red-blooded.
[00:16:57.033 --> 00:17:02.817]  So the people out there driving around with the, you know, support our troops,
[00:17:04.062 --> 00:17:04.642]  Stickers!
[00:17:05.203 --> 00:17:09.565]  You do support the troops by getting them out of a fraud, by bringing them home.
[00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:10.945]  You don't protect America.
[00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:17.708]  All the analysts say that Iraq has now become a laboratory, a laboratory, a factory of real terrorists.
[00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:30.534]  Which, if you read Pentagon Plan P2OG, six billion funding a year, it is meant to, quote, stir up terrorists, create terrorists, create crises as an excuse and a pretext for U.S.
[00:17:30.554 --> 00:17:32.135]  military force in the Middle East.
[00:17:33.203 --> 00:17:34.264]  It is not our opinion.
[00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:38.089]  It is not the founding commander of Delta Forces' opinion.
[00:17:38.689 --> 00:17:43.435]  It is not one of the most highly decorated veteran SAS officers' opinion.
[00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.966]  It is not Dr. Smith's opinion.
[00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:48.168]  It is not Alex Jones' opinion.
[00:17:48.188 --> 00:17:51.530]  It is not Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, opinion.
[00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:57.273]  It is not Congressman Ron Paul, Vietnam, Dr. Veteran, opinion.
[00:17:57.814 --> 00:18:00.295]  It is not the opinion of any of us.
[00:18:00.415 --> 00:18:01.996]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:03.677]  We've looked at the facts.
[00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:09.481]  The war is designed to go on as long as possible to make the defense contractors more money,
[00:18:10.894 --> 00:18:33.847]  and the contractors that serve the troops more money and serve the contractors more money and more importantly it's meant as a domestic distraction according to Bush's own biographer his own autobiography look at our sources of information out of their own mouths out of the horse's mouths it is about using Iraq as a military launch base to project force into the region
[00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:43.946]  It is a fraud, it is a lie, and people who are supporting this because they think George Bush is conservative, you're on the wrong side of history!
[00:18:46.648 --> 00:18:49.771]  Our troops are breathing depleted uranium.
[00:18:51.412 --> 00:18:56.657]  Their birth defects universally tripled after the first Gulf War, they have now more than quadrupled.
[00:18:56.717 --> 00:18:57.438]  Official numbers?
[00:18:58.298 --> 00:18:59.940]  Time Magazine, it's admitted, it's not hidden.
[00:19:01.994 --> 00:19:17.079]  So, when your son, when he's 30, is dying of lung cancer, and they do a CAT scan, and they do a tissue biopsy test, and he's got DU in him, and you're burying your son, know I'm going to be a lot more sad about it than you are!
[00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:19.940]  And know that I tried to stop it!
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.262]  When your daughter's going in the ground, when her kids are crying around her coffin,
[00:19:29.978 --> 00:19:32.460]  I want you to remember that we tried to stop this.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.281]  That we tried to defend this republic.
[00:19:36.322 --> 00:19:39.564]  That we did the best job we could to really support the troops.
[00:19:40.364 --> 00:19:42.846]  And that I'm up late at night losing sleep over the troops.
[00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:45.367]  And that I care about our military.
[00:19:46.168 --> 00:19:48.489]  And I don't like seeing what's happened to it.
[00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.050]  And don't tell me I'm a liberal.
[00:19:51.171 --> 00:19:53.312]  Hillary Clinton wants more war than Bush does.
[00:19:53.332 --> 00:19:57.074]  Because they're all a bunch of pot and paid for scum.
[00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:58.455]  He'll be right back.
[00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:05.761]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you'll want to listen carefully to this.

[00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:05.454]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.674 --> 00:21:17.964]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.384 --> 00:21:18.784]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.824 --> 00:21:24.409]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:27.011]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:29.933]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.973 --> 00:21:32.814]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.934 --> 00:21:38.956]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[00:24:07.485 --> 00:24:09.006]  They railed against the crown.
[00:24:09.706 --> 00:24:11.667]  Ha ha!
[00:24:11.747 --> 00:24:13.368]  Another rag tag band.
[00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:19.352]  Declaring.
[00:24:19.753 --> 00:24:21.934]  They laid their bodies down.
[00:24:24.836 --> 00:24:26.917]  In a bloody war.
[00:24:26.977 --> 00:24:28.618]  For liberty.
[00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:29.139]  For me.
[00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:30.740]  For you.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.161]  Descendants.
[00:24:32.321 --> 00:24:33.081]  Descendants.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.460]  I'm here for my descendants.
[00:24:37.781 --> 00:24:39.441]  The wonderful lives they're going to have.
[00:24:41.242 --> 00:24:42.422]  Think about our descendants.
[00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:44.063]  They're going to be exploring the planets.
[00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:48.244]  They're going to be given God's great promise.
[00:24:48.264 --> 00:24:50.184]  We stand up and do the right thing now.
[00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:52.225]  It's guaranteed.
[00:24:52.385 --> 00:24:53.065]  It's going to happen.
[00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:55.786]  Far ahead of their time.
[00:24:56.741 --> 00:24:57.941]  Thanks to the Renegades.
[00:24:57.961 --> 00:24:59.281]  You know, I'm tempted to play that song.
[00:24:59.522 --> 00:25:00.282]  Hey, dig that up.
[00:25:00.302 --> 00:25:02.102]  We haven't played that in full in about a year.
[00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.722]  Dig that up, Scott, if you can.
[00:25:03.762 --> 00:25:08.983]  I know during the move it's probably in some shelf or something, but find me Steve Ross' Renegades.
[00:25:09.003 --> 00:25:09.783]  We'll play that later.
[00:25:10.724 --> 00:25:11.944]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:25:12.064 --> 00:25:12.964]  Jeff and Mass.
[00:25:13.104 --> 00:25:13.924]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:25:13.944 --> 00:25:14.564]  Thanks for holding.
[00:25:14.904 --> 00:25:15.284]  Ah, yes.
[00:25:15.824 --> 00:25:16.445]  Very simple.
[00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:24.246]  As far as illegal immigration is concerned, I was looking at Michelle Malkin's website on the subject, and these illegal immigrants
[00:25:24.702 --> 00:25:27.443]  I'm not just here to work jobs that Americans will not work.
[00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:28.943]  This is a fifth column.
[00:25:28.963 --> 00:25:31.083]  These people are wearing Che Guevara shirts.
[00:25:31.684 --> 00:25:38.345]  And with our troops in Iraq and the Middle East, this country is wide open for an internal revolution.
[00:25:38.505 --> 00:25:39.946]  Well, you're not joking when you say that.
[00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:43.446]  On Monday is the International Commie Party Day.
[00:25:43.466 --> 00:25:44.867]  They're going to have a big one on May Day.
[00:25:45.107 --> 00:25:46.507]  They've got red flags everywhere.
[00:25:46.567 --> 00:25:50.308]  They've got the Farm Workers Party flags that are openly communistic.
[00:25:50.328 --> 00:25:50.548]  Yes.
[00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:52.035]  Oh yeah, that's a fact.
[00:25:52.215 --> 00:26:00.058]  And let me add that I believe that America's demise will come when gas prices go to about $7 a gallon.
[00:26:00.598 --> 00:26:02.119]  Which the Bilderberg Group said it would.
[00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:03.179]  Well, that's it.
[00:26:03.379 --> 00:26:05.460]  And people go by their stomachs.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.900]  People don't care about anything.
[00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:16.003]  You'll see massive amounts of people going out into the streets, white, blacks, and Hispanics, all fighting each other like Bosnia and Herzegovina.
[00:26:16.584 --> 00:26:20.625]  And then UN troops will come into this country, crackheads,
[00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:28.965]  The borders will be sealed, except it will keep guys like us in, and we will all be put into camps where our organs will be taken out.
[00:26:29.325 --> 00:26:31.547]  That will be the end of America as we know it.
[00:26:31.888 --> 00:26:34.430]  It will be like the movie V for Vendetta.
[00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.232]  Did you see the movie V for Vendetta?
[00:26:36.312 --> 00:26:36.912]  Yes, I did.
[00:26:37.753 --> 00:26:39.875]  That's what the future is going to be like.
[00:26:39.955 --> 00:26:44.459]  America will be a third world country, and we'll be the world's biggest leper colony.
[00:26:45.507 --> 00:26:50.611]  And the whole world will dump its bomb twenty-five percent... And England prevails!
[00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:53.174]  Thanks for the call, I appreciate it.
[00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:57.958]  I'm an Englishman and I'm absolutely proud of it, and England prevails!
[00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:00.301]  You degenerate Americans!
[00:27:00.461 --> 00:27:03.463]  You haven't seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:03.484 --> 00:27:05.205]  Let me just stop you right there.
[00:27:05.545 --> 00:27:09.049]  Paul Watson and I, what, two weeks ago, wrote an article
[00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:13.060]  About what you just said, and it is a possibility.
[00:27:13.161 --> 00:27:15.422]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it is a possibility.
[00:27:15.702 --> 00:27:20.964]  Something's going to happen with the riots and problems in the next year, I would surmise.
[00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:22.865]  I would analyze and give you that projection.
[00:27:24.086 --> 00:27:25.047]  And it is all staged.
[00:27:25.067 --> 00:27:27.868]  You've got to go to PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:27:28.728 --> 00:27:35.712]  And we have a detailed report that we put together last night and have posted today, dealing with the fact that it is admitted.
[00:27:36.893 --> 00:27:37.633]  It is admitted.
[00:27:38.507 --> 00:27:40.808]  In fact, Paul put a question mark on the headline.
[00:27:40.828 --> 00:27:57.095]  I told him to take the question mark off that Bush and Fox hired Bush's big PR firm that he uses for his elections and Fox used back in December to stage these demonstrations and we've tracked it right back to it and the PR firm said we're going to defeat that legislation.
[00:27:58.315 --> 00:28:01.637]  The legislation making illegal aliens who are already illegal felons.
[00:28:01.817 --> 00:28:03.777]  Making the local police enforce the law.
[00:28:05.158 --> 00:28:07.459]  Making the federal police enforce the law.
[00:28:09.422 --> 00:28:15.704]  And yes, instead of us all living in peace together as whites, hispanics, and blacks do here in Austin at least, everybody gets along pretty darn good.
[00:28:17.327 --> 00:28:20.648]  The government and the media is about making us see our differences.
[00:28:20.808 --> 00:28:23.828]  See, in the name of a lot of this multiculturalism, it's the opposite.
[00:28:23.888 --> 00:28:25.969]  It's actually showing the differences.
[00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:38.391]  Getting all the quote minority groups that are now the majority, Hispanics in the southwest of the majority, to think that whites are out to get them, then to get whites to think Hispanics are out to get them, and to get us all at each other's throats.
[00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:39.531]  Hey, let's see the big enemy.
[00:28:39.911 --> 00:28:42.332]  Let's come together against the New World Order, my friends.
[00:28:42.372 --> 00:28:43.572]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.841]  We all have been enslaved in the past.
[00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:48.581]  We don't want our children being enslaved now.
[00:28:49.082 --> 00:28:54.263]  And you explain to these illegal aliens and the people that are supporting them that it's a George Bush PR firm.
[00:28:54.504 --> 00:28:55.324]  That's LA Times.
[00:28:55.344 --> 00:28:56.244]  That's Dallas Morning News.
[00:28:56.264 --> 00:28:57.185]  That's Associated Press.
[00:28:57.905 --> 00:28:59.345]  Hidden in plain view three months ago.
[00:28:59.365 --> 00:29:03.527]  I just remembered it two days ago and went and researched it and sure enough my memory served correct.
[00:29:03.547 --> 00:29:04.107]  There it was.
[00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:05.148]  Caught red-handed.
[00:29:05.188 --> 00:29:08.369]  A very important article up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:29:09.989 --> 00:29:11.510]  A foreign government
[00:29:12.384 --> 00:29:29.342]  Has come into America, hired a PR firm, worked in tandem with the media, the Spanish media, the English-speaking media, to propagandize the American people, to back us off, because there's a real grassroots revolution against these open borders and our sovereignty being destroyed.
[00:29:30.243 --> 00:29:33.506]  The good news is the first week and a half of protest were nothing but Mexican flags.
[00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:35.443]  You can't unring that bell.
[00:29:35.503 --> 00:29:39.946]  People have seen that now, so now they're serving out the American flags, desperately trying to keep it going.
[00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:41.186]  It's too late.
[00:29:41.787 --> 00:29:44.088]  So it blew up in your face again, New World Order.
[00:29:44.308 --> 00:29:46.149]  Your PR campaign's a failure.
[00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:50.032]  You may have defeated the legislation, but you've woken the sleeping giant.
[00:29:50.252 --> 00:29:51.373]  Now where's the whirlwind?
[00:29:51.893 --> 00:29:52.813]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:54.895]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.815 --> 00:29:58.497]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.494 --> 00:30:07.477]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:30:07.677 --> 00:30:10.039]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:13.560]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.543]  Protect-A Engine Treatment, Protect-A Transmission Treatment, and Protect-A Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[00:30:18.823 --> 00:30:26.575]  Protecta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[00:30:26.895 --> 00:30:33.706]  Only Protecta contains a new technology, Nano-B, which is not found in any competitive additive products at your local auto parts store.
[00:30:34.807 --> 00:30:35.247]  We're good to go.
[00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:14.440]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.145]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:31:18.405 --> 00:31:22.630]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.854]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:33.602]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:33.822 --> 00:31:39.308]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:39.548 --> 00:31:46.472]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:31:46.692 --> 00:31:50.635]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:00.996 --> 00:32:11.283]  TriVortex Technology features subtle energy products that include an item called Tri-Vibes that allow you to save hundreds of dollars by wearing, rather than orally taking, vitamins and nutrients.

[00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:58.010]  We don't need no education.
[00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:05.572]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:33:19.637 --> 00:33:21.038]  Welcome back.
[00:33:21.218 --> 00:33:23.620]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:28.262]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:50.018 --> 00:33:58.765]  Early in the week you had a call from a listener with a question about a link on Jimmy Walter's reopened 9-11 site.
[00:34:20.729 --> 00:34:29.632]  To the question of whether blue screen technology was used to create fake doctored video broadcast by CNN and MSNBC.
[00:34:29.792 --> 00:34:36.214]  Well I wasn't, let me be clear, I wasn't specifically attacking Walter for having some link on his side of a thousand plus links.
[00:34:36.594 --> 00:34:43.416]  I'm just saying I believe the progenitors, the people that came up with that idea, the people pushing it, are just out of control.
[00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:43.796]  Go ahead.
[00:34:44.316 --> 00:34:46.097]  Well you cavalierly dismissed
[00:34:46.736 --> 00:34:48.418]  The whole issue is a red herring.
[00:34:48.478 --> 00:34:49.840]  Yes, I cavalierly dismissed it.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:35:02.175]  If, indeed, fake doctored video has been used by the networks, which we know the American people are... Ma'am, ma'am, I talked to personal family friends of mine that I've known for over a decade who saw the second plane hit.
[00:35:03.058 --> 00:35:10.480]  Maybe they think they saw a plane hit, but the fact of the matter is... And maybe there's space aliens in the basement of the Capitol Building.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.461]  At least two of the flights aren't even on the BTS database.
[00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:14.942]  Those would be flight 11 and flight 77.
[00:35:15.002 --> 00:35:16.042]  They never existed.
[00:35:16.062 --> 00:35:19.904]  Ma'am, I'm not saying they didn't change flights and have little squirrely things going on.
[00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.524]  We know it's an inside job.
[00:35:21.544 --> 00:35:29.947]  If we have hard evidence that fake doctor... a cartoon was broadcast to send us off to war,
[00:35:30.737 --> 00:35:32.238]  That is absolutely vital.
[00:35:32.318 --> 00:35:33.098]  And the media!
[00:35:33.478 --> 00:35:35.639]  The media is at the center of the whole 9-11 incident.
[00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:37.180]  What fake cartoon are you talking about?
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.181]  Are you talking about the fat bin Laden?
[00:35:39.881 --> 00:35:42.382]  You know, that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
[00:35:42.522 --> 00:35:43.082]  Absolutely.
[00:35:43.443 --> 00:35:52.086]  If the media is broadcasting fake doctored video, we have to put that out there and we have to explain to people the manner in which it's being used.
[00:35:52.106 --> 00:35:55.548]  Well, man, what I'm telling you is, do you think it was holograms or blue screen?
[00:35:56.189 --> 00:35:58.270]  No one has said that I know it was holograms.
[00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:03.251]  I'm convinced, I'm absolutely convinced that at least one of those videos is fake.
[00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:05.452]  You can see it when you walk through it frame by frame.
[00:36:05.712 --> 00:36:08.713]  There is no impact when the object hits the tower.
[00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:18.716]  Now, I don't want to get into a discussion of the specifics of what specific technologies were used to create fake doctored video material.
[00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:21.956]  I was feeling pretty good, Gene, but I've got a headache now.
[00:36:24.418 --> 00:36:30.921]  I guess it's a question of just how much, how critical you consider the media to the whole brainwashing of the American public.
[00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:34.742]  Well, there's a thousand times a thousand different points I'm integrating, Jane.
[00:36:35.182 --> 00:36:40.105]  Tell you what, let me put you on hold just so I'm not distracted and I'll go back to you and let you comment on what I'm about to say.
[00:36:41.045 --> 00:36:41.885]  Okay, number one.
[00:36:43.446 --> 00:36:45.667]  The globalists follow past plans.
[00:36:45.927 --> 00:36:46.887]  They're psychopaths.
[00:36:46.927 --> 00:36:53.330]  Psychopaths, if you've studied criminology, do the same thing with different variants on that main theme over and over again.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.221]  And in Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[00:36:57.261 --> 00:37:18.375]  government document planning 9-11 style attacks with hijacked jets, which is official, admitted, declassified, public, reported on even by ABC News and Baltimore Sun, the government says they will stage CIA operatives getting on board aircraft that take off in plain view at public airports, at international airports.
[00:37:19.102 --> 00:37:27.946]  They take off and go somewhere else, and then drones, cargo planes, dressed up like passenger planes, are blown up, and a fake manifest is issued publicly.
[00:37:29.027 --> 00:37:29.747]  This is all in there!
[00:37:29.867 --> 00:37:30.307]  Go read it!
[00:37:31.948 --> 00:37:45.434]  Preferably, it's said with young people, students on board, because that will cause a helpful wave of national indignation to be focused on Cuba, and then, of course, the widening war that they wanted to have with the Soviet Union.
[00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:47.355]  It was real in 1967, when
[00:37:49.935 --> 00:38:00.245]  President Johnson and Defense Secretary McNamara parked 14 miles off the coast of Egypt, the USS Liberty, and then with unmarked Israeli planes, it was a deal with the U.S.
[00:38:00.265 --> 00:38:06.532]  and Israel, I had the admirals on, the JAG officers, this is all public now, attack that ship
[00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:13.852]  To blame it on Egypt, and they attempted to sink it and kill all aboard and strafe the life rafts to blame it on Egypt.
[00:38:13.892 --> 00:38:20.254]  And then when the ship asked for help with an emergency transmitter that the Israelis hadn't shot away, they were jamming the American signals.
[00:38:20.494 --> 00:38:29.136]  The pilot, one of the pilots admits, of the two wings that attacked it, that they were ordered to attack and knew it was American and tried to refuse and were threatened with court martial over the radio.
[00:38:29.636 --> 00:38:31.537]  All these people, this is public, not debatable.
[00:38:31.937 --> 00:38:32.897]  That was a real ship.
[00:38:32.937 --> 00:38:35.898]  They didn't go stick a fake one out there, okay?
[00:38:39.056 --> 00:38:41.698]  Gladio, all these attacks, they're real.
[00:38:42.198 --> 00:38:47.741]  They blew up real mosques, they killed real religious leaders, they shot real crowds of people.
[00:38:47.842 --> 00:38:52.765]  In 1953 to bring down Mozadek and Iran, Kermit Roosevelt and CIA and MI6 together in tandem.
[00:38:53.885 --> 00:39:00.109]  We have the publicly released after-action reports from Kermit Roosevelt to Tim Downing Street and to President Eisenhower.
[00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:02.751]  I talked to
[00:39:03.667 --> 00:39:16.552]  Jimmy Wright, good family friend of mine, I've stayed at his home many times, good friends with him and his family, structural engineer, that day, within an hour or two of it happening, live on air, had him on, saying clearly there were bombs in the building, clearly controlled demolition.
[00:39:17.012 --> 00:39:24.455]  He heard the first plane hit, got up and was watching, and they'd already evacuated and got downstairs, and he saw the second one hit.
[00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:25.815]  We ought to dig that out and play that again.
[00:39:28.556 --> 00:39:29.456]  All of that happened.
[00:39:30.197 --> 00:39:31.037]  That was witnessed.
[00:39:31.855 --> 00:39:43.586]  I know other people, personally, friends of mine, who saw the first plane hit, who saw the second plane hit.
[00:39:43.846 --> 00:39:47.810]  Listen, blue screen is too hard to use, and yeah, people are saying holograms.
[00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:49.912]  Holograms are too hard to use.
[00:39:51.714 --> 00:39:52.615]  It was real.
[00:39:52.715 --> 00:39:54.817]  Those were real planes hitting.
[00:39:56.098 --> 00:39:58.860]  And I have challenged everyone in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.121]  I haven't told you what to say or what to do or what to believe.
[00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:04.323]  I get criticized because I say I'm not going to focus on the Pentagon.
[00:40:04.403 --> 00:40:06.064]  Obviously the story we're being told isn't true.
[00:40:06.544 --> 00:40:10.727]  I'm not going to focus on this or that because it's honey pots meant to create a big debate.
[00:40:11.247 --> 00:40:13.989]  And believe me, I could have sold a lot of videos if I did do that.
[00:40:14.869 --> 00:40:25.576]  I focused on prior knowledge, government involvement, NORAD stand down, Bin Laden being CIA, Marvin Bush running security, bombs in the buildings, Building 7 getting blown up, drills that were carried out that day.
[00:40:27.777 --> 00:40:31.239]  Bush signing W199I, ordering the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:45.708]  You can convince college students, and you can convince mom and pop, and you can convince Sally Soccer Mom and Joe Sixpack with the Pentagon business and all the rest of it, and that's fine and dandy and I've left that to others.
[00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:49.811]  And they're big stars.
[00:40:49.831 --> 00:40:51.592]  I can convince congressmen
[00:40:52.339 --> 00:40:54.001]  I can convince Hollywood people.
[00:40:54.502 --> 00:40:56.685]  I can convince people with doctorates.
[00:40:57.145 --> 00:40:59.548]  I can convince chief economists.
[00:40:59.708 --> 00:41:10.622]  I can convince big high-powered individuals by not putting on a case where it's nebulous things that look suspicious but I can't prove one way or the other.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:23.208]  I win with the people that count, and America wins when we focus on the issues that cannot be debated, that they cannot get around, that are absolute fact.
[00:41:24.549 --> 00:41:35.097]  And the fact is, criminal elements of our government planned, funded, executed, and then engaged in the propaganda of the aftermath of 9-11.
[00:41:36.275 --> 00:41:41.416]  And saying there was blue screen and holograms is the kiss of death.
[00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.396]  Let me give you another piece of evidence of that.
[00:41:44.817 --> 00:41:46.197]  What is Popular Mechanics?
[00:41:47.237 --> 00:41:48.297]  What is Vanity Fair?
[00:41:48.717 --> 00:41:54.278]  What is the New York Times, the Washington Post, and all the paid blogs, Front Page Magazine, the rest of them?
[00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:00.599]  What do they do?
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.260]  They attack
[00:42:05.071 --> 00:42:08.314]  The Pentagon, they attack the holograms, they attack the blue screen.
[00:42:10.837 --> 00:42:17.764]  Because those are areas where we can debate it till the end of the earth, until the hills fall down.
[00:42:19.426 --> 00:42:26.874]  Please, please, please, if you want to be effective, take my ten cents for what it's worth.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.061]  Start out with people on Northwoods.
[00:42:30.522 --> 00:42:31.963]  Start out with them on Gladio.
[00:42:32.343 --> 00:42:33.744]  Start out with them on the Reichstag.
[00:42:34.104 --> 00:42:35.265]  Start out with them on the Main.
[00:42:35.585 --> 00:42:37.066]  Start out with them on the Lusitania.
[00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:41.950]  Start out with them on Mozadek and Iran.
[00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:56.180]  Start out where you can go to CIA.gov, where it's all admitted, where they've shot their mouths off, where they carried out terror attacks, or staged events, or provocateured,
[00:42:57.634 --> 00:43:06.001]  You see, if I'm a prosecutor and I got a thousand pieces, two thousand pieces of evidence, I'm going to put on the fifty to the jury that cannot be debated.
[00:43:07.482 --> 00:43:17.329]  I'm not going to put on the evidence to the police officers listening right now, to the detectives, to the people out there that understand dealing with crime scenes and crime and evidence.
[00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.252]  I'm not going to put on the stuff that isn't bulletproof.
[00:43:20.993 --> 00:43:27.899]  I'm gonna put on the cast-iron, iron-side, iron-bellied, armored, plaz-steel fat.
[00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:30.241]  And I'm gonna win.
[00:43:32.083 --> 00:43:33.184]  Okay, go ahead, Jane, finish up.
[00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:46.476]  Look, one of the first things that I looked for in the first 24 hours of 9-11 were airport security video cam evidence that, in fact, hijackers, the hijackers who they claimed to have hijacked these planes,
[00:43:47.154 --> 00:43:48.915]  Actually boarded the planes that they were alleged to be on.
[00:43:48.935 --> 00:43:51.516]  And they could only do it in one case?
[00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:55.338]  And they could simply show them going through the security checkpoint into the gates?
[00:43:55.638 --> 00:43:55.998]  Never.
[00:43:56.038 --> 00:44:02.361]  The only video that they showed us at all was what they alleged to be Mohammed Aded getting on a connecting flight to Portland, Maine.
[00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:03.702]  We never had any video.
[00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:11.505]  And that was only, and I agree with you, and that was only, and that was only going through the security checkpoint, not going through the gate onto the plane?
[00:44:11.725 --> 00:44:11.925]  Right.
[00:44:11.965 --> 00:44:13.386]  Bottom line, we never got any
[00:44:13.982 --> 00:44:18.145]  Security cam video from Logan, from Newark, or from Dallas.
[00:44:18.225 --> 00:44:21.007]  And there's only 20.1% on all four of the flights.
[00:44:21.247 --> 00:44:29.872]  Computer malfunctions, two airlines, they're landing planes, the governor says, in Ohio at airports and putting them in the military hangars with the same flight numbers.
[00:44:30.052 --> 00:44:30.713]  Absolutely!
[00:44:30.993 --> 00:44:36.136]  Something really weird went on, Jane, but listen, you're never going to be able to prove exactly what went on.
[00:44:36.536 --> 00:44:40.539]  Well, certainly the claim that the networks faked
[00:44:41.308 --> 00:44:41.508]  I think?
[00:45:13.191 --> 00:45:17.493]  I was wondering if you had seen Ken Welch dot com?
[00:45:18.614 --> 00:45:18.854]  No.
[00:45:19.494 --> 00:45:23.737]  Some very informative information about this weekend on there.
[00:45:24.497 --> 00:45:25.177]  Great, well thank you.
[00:45:26.718 --> 00:45:27.459]  Concerning what, sir?
[00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:29.520]  Um, Texas.
[00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.621]  Oh, how there's going to be terror attacks or something?
[00:45:35.063 --> 00:45:35.823]  More than that, I think.
[00:45:36.624 --> 00:45:37.824]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[00:45:39.285 --> 00:45:40.246]  You know something?
[00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:42.727]  I don't even know what the caller is bringing up here specifically.
[00:45:44.298 --> 00:45:53.926]  But one time I got on air, one time in twelve years, not five times, not twenty times, not a hundred times, one time.
[00:45:54.666 --> 00:46:01.992]  And I said, call the White House, pretty risky for me, and tell them, don't attack the World Trade Center and don't blame it on your asset bin Laden.
[00:46:02.892 --> 00:46:04.714]  And I said, it's going to happen, call them, stop them.
[00:46:05.474 --> 00:46:08.557]  From sources I have, from intelligence, from my own research.
[00:46:09.858 --> 00:46:10.939]  And what happened two months later?
[00:46:10.999 --> 00:46:12.660]  What happened a month after I put out my alert?
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:21.366]  Dr. Tania Karajanian, Chief Economist for Vladimir Putin, went public and said they're going to attack the World Financial Center, the main financial center of the world in New York, lower Manhattan.
[00:46:21.967 --> 00:46:22.968]  She wasn't specific.
[00:46:23.588 --> 00:46:23.948]  I was.
[00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.491]  And what I said came true.
[00:46:27.531 --> 00:46:28.291]  What I said happened.
[00:46:31.494 --> 00:46:35.036]  And now, there are individuals, God bless them, a lot of them don't mean bad.
[00:46:35.096 --> 00:46:35.777]  Some of them may.
[00:46:36.157 --> 00:46:37.198]  I just, it's really sad.
[00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:50.009]  Who get up on the radio, get up on TV, get up on their news sites, and say, this city's going to be blown up by a nuke on this day.
[00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:51.309]  This is going to happen.
[00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:52.030]  That's going to happen.
[00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.891]  Planet X will kill us in three years on this day.
[00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:55.731]  Three years passes.
[00:46:56.051 --> 00:46:57.151]  I predicted three years before.
[00:46:57.211 --> 00:47:02.693]  I said, they'll claim that the Gregorian calendar was wrong, and then it's really in two years, because they can keep book sales going that way.
[00:47:03.793 --> 00:47:04.574]  Exactly what I said.
[00:47:04.774 --> 00:47:06.434]  I mean, I even know what they're going to do after.
[00:47:06.474 --> 00:47:07.595]  Don't ask me how my brain works.
[00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:08.375]  I just knew, okay?
[00:47:09.594 --> 00:47:11.535]  Sometimes I think it's a blessing, other times I think it's a curse.
[00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:13.317]  Didn't happen.
[00:47:13.617 --> 00:47:16.699]  The same people saying that are back out selling other books with new things.
[00:47:18.561 --> 00:47:19.001]  Oh man.
[00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.403]  I have a headache now.
[00:47:22.423 --> 00:47:25.285]  I need to eat something.
[00:47:29.188 --> 00:47:31.450]  And people are running around
[00:47:33.644 --> 00:48:01.723]  saying that we're going to be nuked on this day and then when Texas City doesn't get nuked on this day okay now we're going to be nuked on this day and now we're going to be nuked on this day now we're going to be nuked on this day and a lot of people have bitten on this I remember Tex Mars calling me two and a half years ago and going Alex have you gotten a call from this individual Tex is really smart by the way former Air Force intelligence
[00:48:02.682 --> 00:48:05.083]  Space and aeronautics professor, best-selling author, pastor.
[00:48:06.744 --> 00:48:09.005]  And I said, he goes, what's your feeling on this person?
[00:48:09.025 --> 00:48:10.986]  And I go, I think they're probably an operative.
[00:48:12.167 --> 00:48:14.128]  And he said, I agree with you, that's what I thought.
[00:48:15.188 --> 00:48:18.970]  Person calls up, I want to come by your office, I want to talk about the attack on Texas City that's coming.
[00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.071]  It was like two and a half, three years ago.
[00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:23.052]  It's going to happen in a couple months, I want to come warn you.
[00:48:23.412 --> 00:48:25.293]  Text is like, no thanks, have a nice day.
[00:48:26.274 --> 00:48:29.075]  I'm contacted by the same people, no thanks, I'll talk to you later.
[00:48:30.465 --> 00:48:38.307]  Over and over again it's going to happen, over and over again it doesn't happen, over and over again people bite, over and over again I get a headache.
[00:48:40.868 --> 00:48:56.973]  Now the people who really will carry out a terror attack, who you've got to watch, the CFR, or the people that are privy to knowledge of those that will, came out three years ago and said Dallas, Cleveland, Denver,
[00:48:58.098 --> 00:49:00.299]  Will be hit by A-bombs.
[00:49:01.219 --> 00:49:02.940]  Will be hit by smallpox.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.320]  The White House told U.S.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:19.385]  News and World Report in late 2004, before the election, I should say mid, that the Capitol would be hit by a massive attack bigger than 9-11.
[00:49:19.405 --> 00:49:20.265]  It was going to happen.
[00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:21.325]  It was going to be atomic.
[00:49:22.406 --> 00:49:23.846]  I said, that's not going to happen, folks.
[00:49:25.187 --> 00:49:25.867]  At least not now.
[00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:51.311]  And it would be really easy for me if I wanted to instantly have the top story, instantly be the biggest thing in alternative media on the web, I could put out a report right now, I could call Paul Watson up, hey Paul, yes Alex, I want you to do some research on this, there's some chatter that they're going to nuke the Capitol, or they're going to nuke Texas City, and just put out a report saying that it's a good chance it's going to happen and we've got sources saying it.
[00:49:52.472 --> 00:49:55.933]  And Paul, of course, isn't immoral and stupid, so he'd say no.
[00:49:56.173 --> 00:49:59.954]  But if he did, we'd write the article and you'd get millions of readers that first day.
[00:50:02.395 --> 00:50:05.896]  But see, I'm not here to get millions of readers just for millions of readers.
[00:50:06.296 --> 00:50:07.377]  I've got a little bit of money in the bank.
[00:50:07.397 --> 00:50:08.177]  I don't even spend it.
[00:50:08.197 --> 00:50:08.957]  I don't care about it.
[00:50:10.498 --> 00:50:11.778]  I'm not here to be a big shot.
[00:50:11.818 --> 00:50:12.478]  I don't care.
[00:50:13.098 --> 00:50:18.820]  I don't like being bugged at the supermarket and at the mall and at Target when I'm buying socks.
[00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:20.921]  I'm not in this for ego.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.667]  I'm in this to aggressively defend my family, and hence the country they live in, and the planet they live in.
[00:50:27.588 --> 00:50:28.329]  I'm a warrior.
[00:50:30.312 --> 00:50:30.833]  For freedom.
[00:50:31.874 --> 00:50:33.497]  And I've got my head screwed on straight.
[00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:34.979]  And I'm aggressive.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.321]  And I'm focused.
[00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:42.015]  And I'm not going to pick up a bunch of COINTELPRO DISINFORMATION TRASH!
[00:50:42.556 --> 00:50:47.179]  And I'm sick and tired of having to respond to it year in and year out.
[00:50:47.219 --> 00:50:51.723]  In fact, I'm calling Paul Watson up and we're putting an article together rebuking all of this.
[00:50:51.743 --> 00:50:54.325]  I already told him yesterday too and he's been too busy to.
[00:50:54.345 --> 00:50:58.629]  Or maybe I've got to get online and write the thing by myself.
[00:51:03.007 --> 00:51:05.850]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:07.691]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.032 --> 00:51:12.696]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:17.460]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:22.105]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.305 --> 00:51:25.148]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.730]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:34.496]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.736 --> 00:51:41.962]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.202 --> 00:51:44.644]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.804 --> 00:51:46.606]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:51:46.626 --> 00:51:46.906]  1-888-253-3139.

[00:52:02.108 --> 00:52:08.331]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.471 --> 00:52:14.634]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.914 --> 00:52:23.358]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:30.622]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.922 --> 00:52:35.745]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.965 --> 00:52:41.349]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:44.791]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:45.132 --> 00:52:53.077]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:53.697]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.423 --> 00:53:03.743]  I think so.
[00:53:18.647 --> 00:53:19.308]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.169 --> 00:53:51.252]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.432 --> 00:53:57.297]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:04.840]  Don't worry.
[00:54:05.361 --> 00:54:06.882]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.402 --> 00:54:10.084]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.564 --> 00:54:14.066]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.086 --> 00:54:18.589]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.149 --> 00:54:23.372]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:54:24.133 --> 00:54:25.614]  The ring of fire.
[00:54:27.194 --> 00:54:28.535]  You know, that's what the government does.
[00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:36.016]  They constantly run around saying, we're going to get nuked, we're going to get smallpox, SARS is going to kill us, bird flu is going to kill us, kill us, kill us, kill us.
[00:54:36.636 --> 00:54:44.038]  And then we're always here saying, well, if it does happen, it's going to be in the future because they've still got to set up the police state, and it's going to be the government that's behind it.
[00:54:45.178 --> 00:54:51.660]  And then all these people that constantly, year after year, put out baloney, and put out hoaxes, and put out things that don't come true,
[00:54:53.214 --> 00:54:57.117]  They lose a little credibility with the thinkers, but still so many people buy into it.
[00:54:57.257 --> 00:54:59.178]  And look, I'm not blaming you for questioning.
[00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:00.940]  I'm not blaming you for asking questions.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.161]  I'm not blaming you for looking at it.
[00:55:02.661 --> 00:55:03.922]  It's just I've been doing this a while.
[00:55:04.702 --> 00:55:05.323]  I'm an expert.
[00:55:06.123 --> 00:55:08.005]  And I'm enough of an expert to know I don't have all the answers.
[00:55:08.365 --> 00:55:09.186]  So just don't believe me.
[00:55:09.226 --> 00:55:10.166]  Just check out what I'm saying.
[00:55:12.068 --> 00:55:15.210]  Earlier I was mentioning the SAS officer that quit.
[00:55:16.966 --> 00:55:33.904]  And then I was mentioning the former founder of Delta Force, retired Command Sergeant Major Eric Haney, founding member of the military's elite covert counter-terrorism unit, Delta Force, and going public saying the war's staged, we're stirring up trouble on purpose, there's no real terror threat to America, on and on and on.
[00:55:34.304 --> 00:55:35.365]  And the other guy's top SAS,
[00:55:36.886 --> 00:55:44.951]  London Telegraph, SAS soldier has refused to fight in Iraq and has left the army over illegal tactics of United States troops and the policies of coalition forces.
[00:55:44.971 --> 00:55:50.215]  See, they didn't charge him like they did Dr. Smith, the doctor who refused, who they just gave eight months in prison.
[00:55:50.755 --> 00:55:59.001]  After three months in Baghdad, Ben Griffin told his commander that he was no longer prepared to fight alongside American forces and he was there, of course, three years before on the eve of the war as well.
[00:56:00.433 --> 00:56:02.336]  He said he witnessed dozens of illegal acts by U.S.
[00:56:02.356 --> 00:56:07.924]  troops claiming they viewed all Iraqis as undermension of the Nazi term for races regarded as subhuman.
[00:56:07.944 --> 00:56:08.605]  It goes on and on.
[00:56:09.826 --> 00:56:14.933]  So I thought I would just, since I mentioned that earlier, I would give you the names because the names were failing me, memory wise.
[00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:25.575]  And yes, I have the articles that Collar's mentioned about Russian nukes traced to Texas, and it's not a drill, and all this.
[00:56:25.635 --> 00:56:26.776]  And, you know, who knows?
[00:56:26.796 --> 00:56:27.917]  You know, that could be going on.
[00:56:27.977 --> 00:56:29.118]  It's just over and over again.
[00:56:29.458 --> 00:56:32.140]  I hear this story every month, and it's going to happen on this date.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.422]  It's going to happen on that date, and it doesn't happen.
[00:56:34.442 --> 00:56:35.302]  And I get angry.
[00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:41.787]  I mean, is something big going to happen on the eve of the Iran attack?
[00:56:41.807 --> 00:56:42.168]  It could.
[00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:46.731]  But I think they'll attack Iran first, and then claim that Iran attacks us.
[00:56:46.891 --> 00:56:47.832]  And it could even be real.
[00:56:47.872 --> 00:56:48.953]  Iran really could do something.
[00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:53.132]  But most likely it will be in the Middle East and Iraq against U.S.
[00:56:53.172 --> 00:56:53.532]  forces.
[00:56:54.212 --> 00:56:56.633]  Coalition forces, the Brits and the U.S.
[00:56:56.673 --> 00:56:57.493]  is all that's left there.
[00:57:00.074 --> 00:57:07.476]  But instead of always focusing on what we can't prove, what would it be like if we focused on what we could prove?
[00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:12.737]  Let's go ahead.
[00:57:12.777 --> 00:57:13.978]  Well, I don't have time to take calls.
[00:57:14.018 --> 00:57:15.678]  I'll take a few calls in the next five minutes.
[00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:16.938]  We'll get our guest on from Europe.

[00:57:20.941 --> 00:57:23.723]  government terrorism and also hiring provocateurs.
[00:57:23.743 --> 00:57:24.624]  That was part of Gladio.

[00:59:38.305 --> 00:59:41.667]  So we'll go ahead and roll that, and then we'll come back and go to our guests.
[00:59:41.687 --> 00:59:44.928]  We will take calls early in the next hour for all of you holding, so be patient.
[00:59:44.968 --> 00:59:45.728]  We will get to you.

[00:59:58.413 --> 00:59:59.313]  Here is Renegades.
[01:00:11.023 --> 01:00:36.152]  And as Venice became, well, a ragtag band To bring a revolution Some would make him king Others couldn't stand that The cross was a solution But he rose again
[01:00:38.016 --> 01:00:42.899]  Wise men follow him where he roams again.
[01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:47.481]  Wise men follow him, thank God for the renegade.
[01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:03.834]  We're good to go.
[01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:56.605]  From Nazareth he came with rag-tag bands to bring a revolution.
[01:01:57.105 --> 01:02:04.386]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand for that.
[01:02:05.147 --> 01:02:11.808]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:18.241]  Wise men follow him, they know the music here.
[01:02:19.763 --> 01:02:25.169]  Wise men follow him, thank God for the music here.
[01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:45.162]  The Lord knows where we'll be When the coast of heroes renegades your mind
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.922]  But he rose again.
[01:03:14.182 --> 01:03:15.443]  Wise men follow him.
[01:03:16.344 --> 01:03:18.505]  For the renegades.
[01:03:20.286 --> 01:03:22.427]  And the lives they lead.
[01:03:22.928 --> 01:03:27.130]  Born ahead of their time.
[01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:30.432]  A thousand renegades.
[01:03:32.051 --> 01:03:36.399]  When it comes to heroes, Renegade's your mind.
[01:03:53.737 --> 01:03:58.082]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.263 --> 01:04:02.568]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.689]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:04:07.709 --> 01:04:08.929]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:34.539]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:06:00.783 --> 01:06:13.707]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.668]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?

[01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:45.839]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.469 --> 01:07:00.510]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:02.351]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.992 --> 01:07:03.832]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.573 --> 01:07:06.074]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.114 --> 01:07:09.797]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:14.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:27.917 --> 01:07:30.859]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:44.970]  He's got such a voluminous pedigree when it comes to research and doctorates that I think it's best if I just let our guest Dr. Daniel Ganzer
[01:07:46.514 --> 01:07:47.856]  Tell us about himself.
[01:07:48.076 --> 01:07:50.379]  He's been in, of course, major think tanks all over Europe.
[01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:54.384]  He's a Swiss individual living in Switzerland, and he teaches college.
[01:07:54.424 --> 01:07:55.145]  He's a professor.
[01:07:55.485 --> 01:07:59.831]  He's written a book that I now have in my hot little hands a few weeks ago.
[01:07:59.871 --> 01:08:02.434]  It was Essential Research, our new film I'm making.
[01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:26.832]  NATO's Secret Army, Operation Gladio, and terrorism in Western Europe, and of course it's available from Amazon.com, we'll tell you about it later and have a link to that up on Infowars.com, and scholarly work, NATO Stay Behind Armies, NATO's Secret Armies, and this is where they carry out terror attacks or pay a criminal group to carry out a terror attack as a pretext for blaming their political enemies.
[01:08:27.432 --> 01:08:29.214]  And so I'm really honored
[01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:32.253]  Glad to have Mr. Ganser on with us today.
[01:08:32.293 --> 01:08:33.073]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:33.714 --> 01:08:34.114]  Thank you.
[01:08:34.274 --> 01:08:34.855]  Good afternoon.
[01:08:35.055 --> 01:08:35.355]  You bet.
[01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:37.377]  Tell us about yourself in a nutshell.
[01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:44.823]  I know some of it, some of the work you've done we won't even get into today for security reasons, but tell us what you can about yourself.
[01:08:45.924 --> 01:08:47.225]  Well, I'm a historian.
[01:08:47.285 --> 01:08:48.306]  I live in Switzerland.
[01:08:49.367 --> 01:08:54.311]  I'm the father of a young daughter and I teach history, modern history, international relations.
[01:08:55.111 --> 01:08:59.675]  And what I'm really interested in is false flag terrorism and geostrategy.
[01:09:00.442 --> 01:09:04.045]  Because that's the foundation of our entire geopolitical system, isn't it?
[01:09:05.065 --> 01:09:07.347]  Well, abuse of power does exist.
[01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:08.488]  That's certainly true.
[01:09:08.528 --> 01:09:11.370]  And as historians, we sort of study this in detail.
[01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:18.755]  But it's been very difficult during the last years to actually find concrete examples where we have so-called false flag terrorism.
[01:09:18.815 --> 01:09:22.058]  In fact, many people don't even know the term what false flag terrorism is.
[01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:35.810]  But Doctor, is it fair to say that the zeitgeist of governments in modern history has been staging events or provocateuring events to scare populations into accepting unpalatable political agendas?
[01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:39.093]  These things have happened.
[01:09:39.213 --> 01:09:40.454]  It's certainly fair to say.
[01:09:40.494 --> 01:09:45.038]  What I looked at specifically were events in Europe during the Cold War.
[01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:46.660]  That's the period between 1947 and 1991.
[01:09:49.757 --> 01:09:53.542]  What I looked at were the NATO secret armies, and we found data in this context.
[01:09:53.582 --> 01:10:01.413]  We also found data in other continents, in Africa, in Asia, in the Americas, and yeah, it's all over the place.
[01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:09.469]  I would like you to just break down for us, as if you're talking to a layman audience.
[01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:16.533]  We have a very informed, intelligent audience, one of the most informed out there, but there's a lot of new listeners and a lot of people will listen to this and read the transcript later.
[01:10:16.893 --> 01:10:24.337]  Break down what false flag is, why governments engage in it, and then let's just run through it for the audience.
[01:10:24.397 --> 01:10:26.418]  I would just add the caveat beforehand
[01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:49.202]  One of the best open and shut cases is the 1953 overthrow of Mohamed Mozadek, who was pro-America, thrown out the Soviets, man of the year, Time Magazine, and I've listened to Kermit Roosevelt before he died on the radio, the CIA section chief who carried out the attacks with MI6, Foreign British Petroleum, he admitted that they bombed mosques, machine gun crowds,
[01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:52.184]  To blame it on political enemies and to bring down Mosaddegh.
[01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:52.904]  They've been beheaded.
[01:10:53.284 --> 01:10:57.927]  Most of his cabinet put him on house arrest the rest of his life, blaming him for a crime they had committed.
[01:10:58.247 --> 01:11:04.831]  The after action reports are on the CIA's own website and Time Magazine, New York Times also have done reports on it and have it posted.
[01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:09.872]  Well, you're certainly right that the 1953 operation in Iran was a false flag operation, or included elements of false flags.
[01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:43.411]  But the term false flag comes from the time when, you know, adversaries met on the sea and one ship, for instance, had a red flag and the other ship had the blue flag and these groups of ship would fight against each other.
[01:11:43.451 --> 01:11:50.334]  Now, some ships, you know, some captains wanted to be very cunning, very clever, so they hissed a different flag.
[01:11:50.354 --> 01:11:59.518]  So if you take the group with the blue flag, they just hissed the red flag and they could then sail closer to the other ships and attack from within the group.
[01:12:00.138 --> 01:12:02.720]  And that was the origin of the term false flag.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.644]  You actually don't show who you really are, but you pretend you're somebody else.
[01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:13.370]  I myself, Doctor, in one of the few areas of history I have focused on is naval history from 1500 to the 1900s.
[01:12:15.891 --> 01:12:18.772]  And the British, of course, were the masters of false flag.
[01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:24.814]  They would, say, pose as a Spanish ship when Spain was neutral during one section of the Napoleonic War.
[01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:33.257]  They would then run up alongside, even painting their ships, up against the Spanish ships or Dutch ships to then sink them.
[01:12:33.537 --> 01:12:41.520]  Pirates then took the cue from the British and would fly a neutral or friendly flag to get up close on British East India.
[01:12:42.245 --> 01:12:43.705]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:43.765 --> 01:12:45.966]  I mean, you actually put it down correctly.
[01:12:46.346 --> 01:12:54.429]  It seems to the average citizen, it seems like something silly to do, just, you know, paint your ship in a different color or take a uniform.
[01:12:54.469 --> 01:13:04.772]  But you must remember when World War II started, Hitler actually had a unit, a unit of German soldiers trained to sing Polish songs.
[01:13:04.892 --> 01:13:08.613]  And these guys then dressed up as Polish soldiers and
[01:13:09.473 --> 01:13:28.879]  invaded a little radio station which was called Gleiwitz Radiostation and what they did is they presented, you know, they played to be Polish and attacked these Germans there and later Hitler said, well the Polish have attacked us, although these were actually Germans.
[01:13:28.899 --> 01:13:36.261]  And it was later discovered during the Battle of the Bulge there were SS units trained to talk like Americans and Brits.
[01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:37.282]  That's right.
[01:13:37.322 --> 01:13:45.429]  I mean, you know, these things are very, very effective because after they have happened, usually the war starts.
[01:13:45.469 --> 01:13:49.533]  And the war always, always, you know, makes a lot of noise and a lot of confusion.
[01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:52.015]  And people can't go back to this first event.
[01:13:52.055 --> 01:13:53.076]  But if you remember that
[01:13:53.627 --> 01:13:59.011]  The Second World War, which cost 60 million lives, actually started as a false flag.
[01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:01.653]  It's fair to say that false flags do matter.
[01:14:02.074 --> 01:14:02.634]  And it's simple.
[01:14:02.674 --> 01:14:05.356]  How is Hitler going to attack the town of Gleiwitz?
[01:14:05.736 --> 01:14:14.123]  Well, they even went so far as to grab a concentration camp victim, a Pole, dress him up as a Pole to have somebody dead that the Germans supposedly killed.
[01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:15.424]  And I covered that in the new film.
[01:14:15.504 --> 01:14:16.965]  It doesn't have a title yet, folks.
[01:14:17.265 --> 01:14:18.326]  It'll be out in two months.
[01:14:18.706 --> 01:14:19.907]  And this is exactly what they do.
[01:14:19.947 --> 01:14:22.089]  Going back to the original false flags that the Brits
[01:14:22.549 --> 01:14:23.790]  Pioneered and perfected.
[01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:40.762]  They would also capture Spanish or Dutch or they would also capture French ships, get their code books, and then come up and flash their lanterns with the proper code at the horizon to bring in the French ships so they could feed on them.
[01:14:41.303 --> 01:14:52.869]  Yeah, I mean, it's everybody who's sort of working on geo-strategy knows that if you don't look at false flags, you always take a signal as a general signal, you will take a plane as a genuine plane.
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:15:03.375]  Whereas, in fact, everybody knows you can, of course, dress up as, you know, a Pole or a German or an American or a Muslim or a Jew or whatever, you can always stage something.
[01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:10.199]  And this is the cunning side of warfare, which can lead, obviously, sometimes to very dreadful results.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.281]  Yes, Doctor.
[01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:15.104]  Where would you like to start with the state behind armies and NATO starting in 1945?
[01:15:15.204 --> 01:15:17.546]  Is that a good place for us to start?
[01:15:17.586 --> 01:15:18.146]  Yeah, why not?
[01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:18.907]  Let's start there.
[01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:21.629]  I mean, that was the time when the Second World War was over.
[01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:26.253]  Europe was devastated and most strategists in Europe actually
[01:15:26.713 --> 01:15:32.577]  feared an occupation of Western Europe by the Communists in the years to come.
[01:15:32.677 --> 01:15:40.302]  So they thought we must prepare something like a guerrilla network which could then be operated in case of an invasion.
[01:15:40.342 --> 01:15:48.187]  So the primary thinking for creating such secret units was we must have a guerrilla unit ready in case of occupation.
[01:15:48.812 --> 01:15:51.474]  But that was only a first point of the thinking.
[01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:54.116]  That's the excuse for recruiting as the guerrilla networks.
[01:15:54.536 --> 01:15:55.336]  Well, it's not.
[01:15:55.937 --> 01:16:00.360]  We shouldn't say it's an excuse because some people, you know, they're like Norwegian.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.641]  I talked to a number of officers in Norway.
[01:16:02.661 --> 01:16:09.026]  They have been occupied by the Germans and they were unprepared or not well prepared enough.
[01:16:10.027 --> 01:16:13.710]  So they said, we never want that again for the next war.
[01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:14.931]  We really want to be ready.
[01:16:14.991 --> 01:16:18.114]  So they set up secret arms caches in these and that places.
[01:16:18.655 --> 01:16:21.117]  They trained how to operate behind enemy lines.
[01:16:21.137 --> 01:16:29.064]  By the way, I would interrupt you again and say that that's something that the Swiss pioneered is arming their population and having caches and you guys never get invaded.
[01:16:29.745 --> 01:16:30.265]  That's true.
[01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:32.407]  I mean, we had a secret army was called P-26.
[01:16:33.952 --> 01:16:48.039]  And it was set up also after the Second World War and we cooperated with the British MI6 because the Swiss said the British are the best in that trade and it's actually true that probably the British are the best at secret warfare worldwide.
[01:16:48.139 --> 01:16:49.560]  Oh, did you hear me say that last hour?
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:50.981]  Sorry?
[01:16:51.261 --> 01:16:56.423]  It's just interesting, I was having this big debate about who the best, it just sounded like you were agreeing with me.
[01:16:56.704 --> 01:16:59.945]  Last hour I talked about the British being the best.
[01:17:00.526 --> 01:17:03.287]  Yes, I mean I didn't hear that obviously in Switzerland but
[01:17:04.217 --> 01:17:05.998]  I would agree with you when you said it.
[01:17:06.058 --> 01:17:08.159]  The British are very strongly involved.
[01:17:08.599 --> 01:17:14.881]  Obviously, there was a sharing of information between the British and then the Americans picking up after 1945.
[01:17:15.482 --> 01:17:17.582]  And the Israelis are also rather good.
[01:17:17.602 --> 01:17:19.143]  So it's among these three, you know.
[01:17:19.223 --> 01:17:21.344]  It's always a big battle who's actually the best.
[01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:24.245]  Well, I would say that the British are the progenitors.
[01:17:24.905 --> 01:17:37.020]  Yeah, they, you know, they had to hold an empire which stretched over the whole globe and if you want to hold an empire, as the Chinese say, you have to be cunning, you have to deceive, you have to use tricks.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:41.245]  It's not, you know, it's no moral game to be an empire, as the Romans said.
[01:17:42.288 --> 01:17:42.908]  I agree with you.
[01:17:42.928 --> 01:17:44.269]  Wow, this is an amazing interview.
[01:17:44.309 --> 01:17:46.090]  We're on the same page, Doctor.
[01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:50.312]  Please, we're about to break, but please continue with the Stay Behind Networks.
[01:17:51.213 --> 01:18:07.201]  Well, the second problem they faced was that in Western Europe you had nominally democracies, so people, you know, could elect their leaders, where in Eastern Europe you had totalitarian systems, where you just had one party, namely the Communist Party, and this party was more or less directed by Moscow.
[01:18:08.009 --> 01:18:14.310]  But then Western strategists were very concerned that in these democracies of Western Europe,
[01:18:15.064 --> 01:18:23.250]  Namely Italy or France, people would actually go and vote for the wrong people, which in their view were the Communist Party.
[01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:24.771]  So that was a real problem.
[01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:40.303]  They wanted to give Western Europe the right to vote and actually go and have their elections, but they were terrified, really terrified that these people might vote for the Communists, and then you have Communist parties in Western Europe, and that would have weakened NATO from within.
[01:18:40.984 --> 01:18:41.804]  Stay there, Doctor.
[01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:43.866]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:18:44.566 --> 01:18:46.770]  He's Dr. Daniel Ganzer.
[01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:47.551]  Stay with us.

[01:19:01.277 --> 01:19:09.161]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[01:21:54.015 --> 01:21:56.056]  Gene, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:21:56.317 --> 01:21:58.558]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:21:58.838 --> 01:21:59.518]  New toenails?
[01:21:59.878 --> 01:22:00.899]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.541]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.506]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:22:06.526 --> 01:22:09.327]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:22:09.547 --> 01:22:10.928]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:22:10.948 --> 01:22:13.048]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:22:13.188 --> 01:22:14.549]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:22:14.609 --> 01:22:17.409]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:18.890]  Well, here's my secret.

[01:22:40.336 --> 01:22:41.876]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:42.256 --> 01:22:43.396]  Non-X Nail Gel.

[01:23:05.808 --> 01:23:10.771]  Before he leaves us, we'll tell you about Dr. Daniel Gansner's book and how you can get it.
[01:23:10.791 --> 01:23:19.877]  It's reading, must have reading for anybody that wants to know what's going on and the foundation of the type of things we see happening today in our modern world.
[01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:28.222]  Dr. Gansner continuing with the Stay Behind Armies early, early post-war period.
[01:23:28.242 --> 01:23:28.862]  Please continue.
[01:23:30.131 --> 01:23:43.458]  Yeah, the problem was, as I said, that people in Western Europe were voting for Communists, and then you had Communists in parliaments, and then people were scared that these Communists would sort of weaken NATO from within.
[01:23:44.258 --> 01:23:50.141]  So the task ahead, I mean, during the Cold War, it must be remembered, was that everybody was fighting the Communists.
[01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:53.003]  I mean, everybody was saying, they're really scary and they will destroy everything.
[01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:55.277]  So, what could be done?
[01:23:55.297 --> 01:24:03.225]  Strategists then thought, well, we can plant bombs and say, these bombs have been planted by the Communists.
[01:24:03.265 --> 01:24:05.307]  That will make them really look very bad.
[01:24:05.447 --> 01:24:09.411]  And this was a strategy that was being implemented, for instance, in Italy.
[01:24:11.453 --> 01:24:16.498]  Now, the white Russians, the pro-Tsarist forces, enjoyed doing that too.
[01:24:17.439 --> 01:24:29.374]  I mean, you know, false flag operations really is nothing that you can say, you know, only the Germans did it, or only the Cubans did it, or the Russians did it, or the English did it, or the Israeli did it.
[01:24:29.674 --> 01:24:32.778]  There's actually no nation that, you know, had that.
[01:24:33.278 --> 01:24:48.105]  And from what I've studied, doctor, that's really the excuse they use with these specially picked special forces or criminals they hire to do this is, well, they're going to do it, so we've got to do it!
[01:24:48.889 --> 01:24:51.912]  Yeah, but it's, you know, everybody loses in that game.
[01:24:51.952 --> 01:24:53.493]  That's the point we must wake up.
[01:24:53.614 --> 01:24:57.938]  I mean, you can obviously let that happen for some time and then everybody's doing false flags.
[01:24:58.198 --> 01:25:05.184]  What we have now in Iraq, in the ongoing Iraq War, was that we have Special Air Service, SAS.
[01:25:05.224 --> 01:25:07.627]  These are the British Special Forces.
[01:25:08.327 --> 01:25:17.811]  And in one case, you know, they dressed up as Muslims, you know, really wearing a wig and wearing the sort of clothes a Muslim would wear.
[01:25:17.871 --> 01:25:25.393]  In 2005, we had an imposter being caught by the Iraqis who said, gee, why do you guys dress up like that?
[01:25:25.433 --> 01:25:26.734]  And they then found the
[01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:32.280]  The car was full of explosives nearby and it was a huge hazard.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.402]  It also killed police officers.
[01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:37.505]  That's right.
[01:25:37.525 --> 01:25:39.928]  When you're doing a false flag, think of the situation.
[01:25:40.348 --> 01:25:41.449]  You don't want to be caught.
[01:25:44.812 --> 01:25:45.913]  I don't know.
[01:25:46.073 --> 01:25:55.318]  If you were posing now as a Chinese, I don't know whether you can fancy that, but just think of it and travel to Shanghai and blow something up and say, you know, the Chinese are clearly violent.
[01:25:55.338 --> 01:25:56.518]  This is the proof for it.
[01:25:56.659 --> 01:25:59.820]  Although, you know, you did it yourself and then they catch you.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:04.843]  Obviously, it's very embarrassing because you're actually proving the point that you are truly, truly violent.
[01:26:05.183 --> 01:26:06.584]  And then it totally backfires.
[01:26:06.624 --> 01:26:11.666]  So it's very important that the false flag operation remains unknown, remains secret.
[01:26:11.786 --> 01:26:21.490]  Once the public realizes that the false flag operation has actually been carried out by the one who afterwards screams, gee, how valid the others are, you know, he's totally discredited.
[01:26:22.637 --> 01:26:33.786]  You're right, and they are getting caught, and they were caught shooting police, running off, they catch them with fake beards and the whole Muslim outfit on, and then they look in the car and it's full of laws, rockets, machine guns and bombs.
[01:26:34.527 --> 01:26:39.731]  Yeah, but we must remember that really this is the exception that false flag operation people are being caught.
[01:26:40.171 --> 01:26:49.299]  As a rule, you know, if we go back to the Italian case, for instance, we had an attack there in the year 1972 in a small little village called Pediano.
[01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:58.403]  And there, you know, you had a few police officers receiving a call saying, there's a little car at the woods and why don't you check it out?
[01:26:58.423 --> 01:26:59.704]  It seems to have been stolen.
[01:26:59.724 --> 01:27:05.407]  Then the police officers go there and once they are close enough, the car just blows up and they're all dead.
[01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:10.329]  And then, you know, an anonymous phone call says, you know, that was the Red Brigades.
[01:27:10.429 --> 01:27:10.929]  We did it.
[01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:15.912]  So the data you have at the moment is just a lot of bodies all over the place.
[01:27:16.593 --> 01:27:18.876]  Clear sign of violence and destruction.
[01:27:19.436 --> 01:27:24.942]  And you have another phone call or you know today you would have a video or something that you can't trace back.
[01:27:24.962 --> 01:27:26.604]  You don't really know whether it's true or not.
[01:27:27.024 --> 01:27:29.767]  And then this message spreads out into the public.
[01:27:29.787 --> 01:27:34.092]  You know, the journalists go there and obviously the journalists, they don't have a clue what happened.
[01:27:34.432 --> 01:27:37.536]  They just go there and write down what people tell them.
[01:27:37.936 --> 01:27:48.547]  And so you have a whole, you know, sequence of events which leads people to believe, oh gee, the Red Brigades, which were a violent communist group in Italy, they did this indeed.
[01:27:48.707 --> 01:27:54.473]  And what we look at as historians is that this was in 1972, and we found out only 1984, that's 12 years later, that in fact
[01:28:00.118 --> 01:28:10.284]  It was a right-wing Catholic, you know, an Italian Catholic, who staged this incorporation with the Italian military's secret service, the Servizio Informazione Sicurezza Militare.
[01:28:10.544 --> 01:28:12.025]  This is the Italian secret service.
[01:28:12.485 --> 01:28:16.687]  And so it was actually the state, you know, engaging in this operation.
[01:28:16.707 --> 01:28:18.088]  People usually don't think of it.
[01:28:18.308 --> 01:28:18.628]  You're right.
[01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:19.108]  We've got a break.
[01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.850]  I want to go through a whole bunch of cases, the Bologna bombing and others.
[01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:25.953]  And how they do this, and how the government goes and hires these people to carry it out.
[01:28:25.993 --> 01:28:27.554]  We've had intelligence chiefs go public.
[01:28:27.774 --> 01:28:29.015]  We've had former presidents go public.
[01:28:29.035 --> 01:28:30.276]  We've had all these people go public.
[01:28:30.617 --> 01:28:31.417]  It is admitted.
[01:28:31.898 --> 01:28:38.843]  We really got some exposure and a look into this world with what happened in decades of terrorist attacks in Italy.
[01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:44.928]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:47.010]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.249 --> 01:28:58.890]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:59.671]  have diabetes.
[01:29:00.011 --> 01:29:06.933]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:29:07.093 --> 01:29:11.614]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:29:11.814 --> 01:29:14.635]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:30:53.985 --> 01:30:58.051]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:58.271 --> 01:31:01.657]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.837 --> 01:31:05.282]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:08.827]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.847 --> 01:31:14.308]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:14.348 --> 01:31:23.970]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:25.471]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:25.491 --> 01:31:30.872]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:35.848]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:37.269]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:37.429 --> 01:31:41.211]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[01:32:06.609 --> 01:32:10.392]  John in Texas, Ron in New York, Betty in Florida, others, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:12.234 --> 01:32:24.524]  And we are specifically today talking about false flags in Europe and other areas of the world with our guest, and I'm really honored to have with us, Dr. Daniel Ganser.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.921]  And you need to get his book.
[01:32:28.101 --> 01:32:28.961]  You really need to have it.
[01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:31.202]  I haven't asked my webmaster if this is up, but it should be.
[01:32:31.222 --> 01:32:32.222]  If it isn't, we'll get a link to it.
[01:32:32.622 --> 01:32:35.943]  NATO's Secret Army, Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.
[01:32:37.404 --> 01:32:42.906]  Or you can just simply type his name into Google, Dr. Daniel Ganser, and it will come up for you.
[01:32:42.926 --> 01:32:44.046]  You need to get this book.
[01:32:45.366 --> 01:32:47.868]  Ganser is spelled G-A-N-S-E-R.
[01:32:48.128 --> 01:32:49.509]  G-A-N-S-E-R.
[01:32:49.589 --> 01:32:50.190]  Pretty easy.
[01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:51.191]  Dr. Daniel Ganser.
[01:32:51.651 --> 01:32:52.772]  And your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:52.792 --> 01:32:52.872]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:52.912 --> 01:32:54.073]  Dr. Ganser, please continue.
[01:33:01.498 --> 01:33:07.401]  Because you're not just here saying that the Italian government, the CIA, and the P2 Lodge, and others were involved in this.
[01:33:07.441 --> 01:33:14.164]  This is now mainstream news, because I've done the research, and you've done the research more than I have, in the Italian press.
[01:33:14.204 --> 01:33:15.084]  They've been caught.
[01:33:15.865 --> 01:33:17.505]  So let's just look at one country.
[01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:21.067]  There's so many where this happened, with the NATO option, the Salvadoran option, all of it.
[01:33:21.307 --> 01:33:22.407]  Happened in Latin America too.
[01:33:22.667 --> 01:33:27.890]  But let's specifically, if we can, spend a few minutes on Italy itself, and the history of some of the events.
[01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:29.070]  Okay, sure.
[01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:30.251]  Let's focus on Italy.
[01:33:31.075 --> 01:33:37.937]  What you have in Italy is a strong communist party on the left and a conservative Catholic party on the right.
[01:33:38.097 --> 01:33:45.859]  The one, the conservative on the right was called Democrazia Cristiana and on the left it was called Partito Socialista Italiano.
[01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:49.720]  So between these two groups you always had a very strong fight.
[01:33:50.772 --> 01:33:56.254]  And in this fight, obviously, it was not in a civil war, but it almost went to a civil war.
[01:33:56.274 --> 01:33:58.275]  We had a lot of deaths during the Cold War.
[01:33:58.975 --> 01:34:02.176]  And in one specific moment, people died in the following way.
[01:34:02.656 --> 01:34:12.420]  Go back to 1969, go to the Italian city Milano, this is in Northern Italy, and everybody's shopping for Christmas presents and stuff, and suddenly a lot of bombs go off.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:15.821]  And, you know, they kill people all over the place, and everybody's scared.
[01:34:16.821 --> 01:34:19.523]  And you have this effect of terror.
[01:34:19.623 --> 01:34:21.345]  The first effect of terror is fear.
[01:34:21.365 --> 01:34:22.846]  You know, it spreads all over the place.
[01:34:23.286 --> 01:34:28.190]  And then as a second effect, you need somebody who is responsible for this.
[01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:31.513]  And then the message comes out, you know, these were the communists.
[01:34:32.154 --> 01:34:33.034]  These were the communists.
[01:34:33.054 --> 01:34:34.055]  These were the communists.
[01:34:34.476 --> 01:34:36.037]  And people sort of believe this.
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:48.590]  In 2001 or 2 it was, I think, you have a trial in Italy and, you know, you find out it was not the Communists, it was right-wing people, you know, people from the Catholics from the other camp.
[01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:50.371]  So it was a false flag operation.
[01:34:50.952 --> 01:35:01.421]  And then you have an Italian general from the intelligence service, Giandilio Moletti, his name is, and he says, you know, it's true we did this, but we did this together with the CIA.
[01:35:02.682 --> 01:35:19.420]  And this was a very far-reaching claim, you know, he said, you know, we Italians, it's true, we did some false flag operations, but we did this in cooperation with foreign secret services who said, we need to stabilize NATO, and in order to stabilize NATO, we need to defeat the Communists.
[01:35:22.163 --> 01:35:23.164]  So that's just one example.
[01:35:24.179 --> 01:35:31.604]  Now, I wasn't going to bring up current issues because I want to try to keep this in a historical perspective, and that's of course your wish as well.
[01:35:32.584 --> 01:35:39.869]  But at the same time, you brought up SAS dressed up like Arabs, clearly involved in the staging of false flag ops.
[01:35:39.909 --> 01:35:41.090]  That's even mainstream news now.
[01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:54.036]  And we've caught Israelis dressed up as Arabs shooting US troops, and the Marines have even captured them and beat them up and pulled their clothes off, and they're Israeli Special Forces or Israeli contractors.
[01:35:54.937 --> 01:35:58.018]  But then we look at things like the London bombing and all the evidence there.
[01:35:58.038 --> 01:35:59.239]  I mean, I've said it's a false flag.
[01:35:59.279 --> 01:36:00.459]  The evidence shows that.
[01:36:00.499 --> 01:36:05.622]  Even Scotland Yard says they don't think that these were, quote, the bombers or knew what they were part of, and it turns out a SWAT
[01:36:06.022 --> 01:36:07.203]  He's really working for MI6.
[01:36:07.404 --> 01:36:11.968]  I have John Lopness, a former, you know, chief anti-terrorism expert for the Justice Department.
[01:36:12.329 --> 01:36:16.032]  He comes on and says it looks like the British were carrying out the attacks that were involved.
[01:36:16.072 --> 01:36:18.155]  I mean, that's a pretty heavy weight saying that.
[01:36:18.195 --> 01:36:19.496]  We have the drill that day.
[01:36:19.856 --> 01:36:21.478]  We have, you know, all this evidence.
[01:36:21.838 --> 01:36:22.960]  We have all this happening.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.163]  Do you want to get into London briefly or do you want to just move on?
[01:36:27.803 --> 01:36:36.306]  I don't know too much about London, but what I know is that people, like 10 years ago, you know, people didn't even know the term false flag operation.
[01:36:36.406 --> 01:36:43.527]  And now I'm talking to so many, you know, students, newspapers, everybody, everybody tries to find out what is this false flag?
[01:36:43.567 --> 01:36:44.628]  Does it really exist?
[01:36:44.688 --> 01:36:49.769]  You know, like my mother, when she asked me, so what are you studying and what do you specialize in?
[01:36:49.789 --> 01:36:53.130]  And I said, you know, secret warfare and military operations.
[01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:54.111]  I don't know.
[01:37:05.265 --> 01:37:06.806]  Come on, I mean, this is not true.
[01:37:06.906 --> 01:37:08.308]  So what's fake and what's true?
[01:37:08.348 --> 01:37:09.369]  How can we find out?
[01:37:09.409 --> 01:37:11.570]  It's really, it's a real mess then.
[01:37:12.151 --> 01:37:22.380]  And what I'm trying to get at is to show that within the Cold War, we have very, very clear and specific cases where we can show this happened.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.181]  It was a false flag operation.
[01:37:24.561 --> 01:37:25.262]  We know that the
[01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:28.844]  Take for instance 1954, the Lavon Affair.
[01:37:29.205 --> 01:37:39.892]  This was a moment in the time when the Israelis didn't want the British to leave from Egypt because they wanted them to function as a buffer a little bit between Egypt and Israel.
[01:37:40.232 --> 01:37:43.415]  So they dressed up as Egyptians and set off some bombs.
[01:37:43.515 --> 01:37:48.018]  Nobody was killed, but it effectively kept the British there a little longer.
[01:37:48.058 --> 01:37:50.980]  In the end, the Israeli Defense Minister Lavon had to resign.
[01:37:51.903 --> 01:37:55.399]  But, you know, we've loads of false flag operations documented.
[01:37:57.471 --> 01:37:58.912]  Listen, I've got Haratz.
[01:37:59.032 --> 01:38:00.873]  I mean, that's the biggest paper in Israel.
[01:38:00.913 --> 01:38:22.004]  I've got Jerusalem Post, where, what, back in 2002 was also in UPI, United Press International, did a report, and it's admitted that Israel was grabbing young Palestinian youths, holding them for five, six, seven years, in some cases ten years, releasing them as basically stooges who now work for Shin Bet and
[01:38:23.604 --> 01:38:30.250]  Of course, Massad, and having him go out and quote stage Al Qaeda attacks that didn't claim that Al Qaeda was in the West Bank.
[01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:31.491]  There you go.
[01:38:31.511 --> 01:38:37.255]  I mean, the funny thing, once you start turning the world in your head, you know, you can go to many countries.
[01:38:37.295 --> 01:38:38.476]  Go to Cuba, for instance.
[01:38:38.536 --> 01:38:39.157]  If you remember
[01:38:39.637 --> 01:38:42.438]  I recall the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.
[01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:47.100]  You know, obviously it was an effort of the CIA to try to overthrow Castro, which didn't work.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.700]  Everybody knows that part of the story.
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:57.163]  But that small part of the story was that it also contained a false flag, because first, the US wanted to destroy Castro's Air Force.
[01:38:57.723 --> 01:39:00.085]  He only had a few planes, and they were not even good.
[01:39:00.526 --> 01:39:04.910]  But they wanted to bomb Cuba, but it didn't look good.
[01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:08.553]  So what they did is they had planes painted in Cuban color.
[01:39:08.753 --> 01:39:16.881]  So that was American planes painted in Cuban color, which then bombed Cuba and came back and landed in the U.S.
[01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:23.327]  And the story, as it was spread at the United Nations where Cuba protested, was that these were Cuban pilots
[01:39:23.787 --> 01:39:24.308]  I don't know.
[01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:46.632]  This sort of false flag happens again and again and again in so many different places.
[01:39:46.832 --> 01:39:47.733]  Here's another example.
[01:39:48.033 --> 01:39:50.194]  I know you know about the White House memo.
[01:39:50.514 --> 01:39:53.975]  It came out about a year after the Downing Street memo, and this is admitted.
[01:39:53.995 --> 01:39:57.597]  The White House wants to quote arrest whoever released this, so does Downing Street.
[01:39:57.977 --> 01:40:01.258]  Blair is meeting just a few months before the war at the White House.
[01:40:01.898 --> 01:40:06.241]  And Bush says, number one, we can stage a defector coming out who claims he saw WMDs.
[01:40:06.681 --> 01:40:06.981]  We know that.
[01:40:07.041 --> 01:40:07.641]  We've tried that.
[01:40:07.902 --> 01:40:16.607]  Then he says we can paint up American or British planes like UN planes, fly them low, and try to get some of Saddam's forces to fire on them.
[01:40:16.787 --> 01:40:17.947]  That's a false flag right there.
[01:40:17.967 --> 01:40:18.788]  That's it?
[01:40:19.773 --> 01:40:21.154]  And it's not new on the planet.
[01:40:21.214 --> 01:40:22.435]  That's what we have to remember.
[01:40:22.475 --> 01:40:24.816]  It's only new that we start to get to grips with it.
[01:40:25.036 --> 01:40:25.797]  No, I agree, sir.
[01:40:25.817 --> 01:40:28.298]  We learn that they exist and we start to decipher it.
[01:40:28.318 --> 01:40:29.799]  It's really difficult for scientists.
[01:40:30.179 --> 01:40:39.445]  I've said over and over again, Doctor, that the key right now is to have the public have a revelation or an epiphany.
[01:40:40.194 --> 01:41:03.924]  A renaissance of understanding about false flag because I see it as the key in the geopolitical strategy for world empire by the Anglo-American establishment over and over again and now I've gone in ten years myself focusing predominantly on false flag and government sponsored terror to now see that it is commonplace and now entering the popular vocabulary and nomenclature.
[01:41:04.602 --> 01:41:05.103]  That's true.
[01:41:05.143 --> 01:41:15.473]  I mean, what we're looking at is that we're in a sort of waking up process to a strategy which has been there in the, let's say, in the abyss of international relations.
[01:41:15.493 --> 01:41:17.074]  You know, people wouldn't talk about it.
[01:41:17.475 --> 01:41:22.840]  It was in the dark chambers and, you know, specialists knew that it existed.
[01:41:23.701 --> 01:41:29.907]  But most people would hardly confess that they actually participate in false flag operations at all.
[01:41:30.327 --> 01:41:35.993]  Whereas now, let's say we've had false flag operations for at least 50 years, which we can document very well.
[01:41:36.313 --> 01:41:42.500]  The recent false flag, obviously we've had them for many, many hundred years, but the last 50 years we can document them rather well.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.963]  And people start to say, so what's the use?
[01:41:46.904 --> 01:41:53.646]  When I usually teach strategic thinking, I always say, think of a weapon, and then people think of a gun first, right?
[01:41:53.826 --> 01:41:56.527]  They think of guns, and then they think of something powerful.
[01:41:56.947 --> 01:42:04.330]  Then they think of an aircraft carrier, or of a stealth bomber, or a screw missile, something really big and heavy, heavy hardware.
[01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:08.951]  I always point out that the strongest weapon is not visible.
[01:42:09.091 --> 01:42:11.612]  You can't even smell it, because it's fear.
[01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:18.027]  And fear is a weapon that can be used to do many things.
[01:42:18.107 --> 01:42:24.194]  Obviously, if you live in a relationship, you know that one partner can use fear against the other one.
[01:42:24.314 --> 01:42:30.600]  Or if you live in a school, if you go to work, you know that fear can be used and is being used as a power tool.
[01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:33.924]  And so it is being used as well in international politics.
[01:42:34.324 --> 01:42:40.630]  And their false flag operation actually are one of the essential mechanisms to trigger fear.
[01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:41.911]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:41.931 --> 01:42:54.481]  I mean, in this toolbox, it is one of the most used, most effective tools, and that's what, in his after-action report in 1953, that's what Kermit Roosevelt tells the White House, Eisenhower, and that's what he tells Tim Downing Street.
[01:42:54.521 --> 01:42:57.664]  He says, this is incredibly effective, we've got to use this more.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.041]  That's true.
[01:42:59.061 --> 01:43:06.170]  That was the first feeling of politicians who got this tool into their hands.
[01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:07.212]  They were fascinated.
[01:43:07.232 --> 01:43:09.635]  They thought, gee, it's not moral.
[01:43:10.055 --> 01:43:14.060]  It's not right, obviously, because you kill and lie at the same time.
[01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:16.123]  It's wonderful.
[01:43:16.163 --> 01:43:16.964]  It's so strong.
[01:43:17.004 --> 01:43:19.406]  We probably can use it and make it a better world.
[01:43:19.846 --> 01:43:22.349]  Most people are convinced that they're going to make a better world anyway.
[01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:26.853]  So these people who use false flag are always convinced they're fighting something very evil.
[01:43:27.194 --> 01:43:30.537]  And once that has been defeated, then they will be good.
[01:43:30.577 --> 01:43:31.918]  But in the meantime, they have to be bad.
[01:43:32.178 --> 01:43:39.686]  So this false flag strategy was used, and now we see it all over the place, and we can't get it back into the box.
[01:43:40.282 --> 01:43:51.225]  And this is something we must wake up to, that we were tricked to think that we can handle it, but once again, very much like nuclear weapons, we're not really able to handle it, and now we have a mess.
[01:43:51.585 --> 01:43:52.265]  Well, exactly.
[01:43:52.405 --> 01:43:53.125]  Here's an example.
[01:43:53.525 --> 01:44:05.548]  They have drills at school where they take ten eight-year-old children, point machine guns at them, scream at them, yell at them, they cry, and the government says the answer is, we've got to have a police state at the school to keep you safe from shooters.
[01:44:06.088 --> 01:44:08.349]  And then it's just part of the brainwashing for the police state.
[01:44:08.389 --> 01:44:10.630]  Here in Austin, we've had... Where is that happening?
[01:44:11.130 --> 01:44:11.890]  Here in the U.S.
[01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:17.372]  We've had fake bio-attacks in downtown Austin before 9-11, shutting down the city.
[01:44:17.392 --> 01:44:20.473]  Then they admit later, oh, we really didn't pull over a Muslim.
[01:44:20.773 --> 01:44:21.613]  He was an officer.
[01:44:21.673 --> 01:44:22.493]  We were staging it.
[01:44:22.754 --> 01:44:26.775]  They have a fake nuclear spill on I-35, shot down the highway, total hysteria.
[01:44:27.055 --> 01:44:29.136]  Then at midnight, they announce it was just a drill.
[01:44:30.336 --> 01:44:38.322]  Well, we have these drills constantly where at first they announce they're real, sir, just to terrorize us and create this atmosphere of fear here in America.
[01:44:38.862 --> 01:44:42.685]  You know, people always ask, why is it useful to study Latin?
[01:44:42.945 --> 01:44:45.427]  It's such an old language and it's all gone.
[01:44:45.467 --> 01:44:46.228]  Who uses it anyway?
[01:44:46.288 --> 01:44:46.808]  Fee bono.
[01:44:46.828 --> 01:44:51.331]  But Latin, you know, if you know what terror means, it means great fear in Latin.
[01:44:51.391 --> 01:44:52.052]  That's what it means.
[01:44:52.532 --> 01:44:55.794]  And if a country is in great fear, and probably the U.S.
[01:44:55.854 --> 01:45:00.937]  is in great fear, or has been during the last five years, then the country is paralyzed.
[01:45:00.957 --> 01:45:03.978]  You know, you will feel it when you go out and you're in a different country.
[01:45:03.998 --> 01:45:06.259]  You will feel it will be different, but there as well.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:13.804]  Every country can be put under great fear once you use mechanisms that strengthen the fear.
[01:45:13.864 --> 01:45:21.848]  And people can break... What I always say is, you know, I was born in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, so I had a very strong focus on Italy.
[01:45:22.328 --> 01:45:32.913]  And when people then say, so what can we do if we see there is false flags going on, but it happens so quickly that, you know, we can't find out who it was and everything is so complicated.
[01:45:33.354 --> 01:45:37.636]  And I always say, steer clear of the fear, because that's the only thing.
[01:45:37.736 --> 01:45:41.858]  It's not the 10 people who were killed in the false flag who are actually the target group.
[01:45:42.238 --> 01:45:44.880]  The target group are the millions who survived.
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.241]  And they're not even aware that they're the target group.
[01:45:47.281 --> 01:45:47.641]  They think,
[01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:49.662]  Oh, gee, these are really unfortunate.
[01:45:49.702 --> 01:45:52.103]  They died in this nasty terrorist attack.
[01:45:52.123 --> 01:45:59.288]  But as I said, in Italy, this terrorist attack targeted the rest, the surviving who thought they might be next.
[01:46:00.068 --> 01:46:01.889]  Yes, the living are the targets.
[01:46:02.129 --> 01:46:04.871]  And so, in the past, when the U.S.
[01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:07.452]  had some real terror attacks in the 1970s,
[01:46:09.728 --> 01:46:10.208]  I don't know.
[01:46:29.879 --> 01:46:43.009]  But then after a big event, when you know it's the government or one of their elements, you see the tell-tale signs, but also you see them instantly maximizing it, instantly leveraging it, and we see them with the endless fake terror alerts.
[01:46:43.069 --> 01:46:44.130]  That's a form of terror.
[01:46:44.410 --> 01:46:55.519]  No one is killed, and then the White House had to admit, as documents went public, that they were releasing those whenever something scary came out about Enron, or some new corruption scandal came out, they would bump it up to the red level,
[01:46:55.959 --> 01:47:01.764]  That was a mechanism of not even carrying out attacks but bringing the fear back and you can see who the real terrorists are.
[01:47:01.984 --> 01:47:23.182]  The terrorist is the person who threatens a crime or carries out a crime for their political aims against a population or a government or institution and then you see the government proving they're the terrorist in most cases because there they are openly hyping the fear day one when it happens and using it and maximizing it.
[01:47:23.806 --> 01:47:29.352]  I mean, what we have is we do have governments using the tool, but we also have, obviously, private groups.
[01:47:29.372 --> 01:47:34.118]  I mean, you know, they're normal terrorists in the genuine sense, and I'm not saying false.
[01:47:34.358 --> 01:47:35.239]  They do exist.
[01:47:35.339 --> 01:47:36.060]  They do exist.
[01:47:36.582 --> 01:47:57.670]  And what has to be emphasized is that what is very difficult to say is in a specific case, whether it was this classical normal terrorist that you always thought of as this independent union unit, not infiltrated by any military intelligence service and manipulated by any government or so, you know, like a genuine terrorist group, they exist, they carry out killings.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.361]  And they have done this during the last hundred years.
[01:48:00.421 --> 01:48:01.282]  That's one group.
[01:48:01.382 --> 01:48:08.505]  And on the other group, you do have state actors who just pose as terrorists and who use terrorist strategy.
[01:48:09.066 --> 01:48:17.490]  And what is important from a historical perspective is that we always sit back when we see a terrorist attack and say, gee, OK, what was this?
[01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:20.752]  Was this my tax money being used against me by the state?
[01:48:21.292 --> 01:48:26.938]  Always do the private group that carried out another atrocity because both cases are always possible.
[01:48:27.139 --> 01:48:33.406]  Exactly, so it's important doctor to just instantly question and research anytime there's an event and never give in to fear.
[01:48:33.426 --> 01:48:34.447]  That's exactly the point.
[01:48:34.507 --> 01:48:39.132]  We must research much more because what we do is we always get hyped up, you know.
[01:48:39.492 --> 01:48:40.712]  There's the terrorist attack.
[01:48:41.072 --> 01:48:42.253]  Next day, there's the answer.
[01:48:42.533 --> 01:48:44.373]  And the day after, we want the death penalty.
[01:48:44.653 --> 01:48:46.174]  But the saying doesn't work like that.
[01:48:46.434 --> 01:48:50.495]  We get caught into a huge spiral of violence all over the globe.
[01:48:50.535 --> 01:49:04.018]  And only later, if you look at Indonesia, there was the Indonesian president, Waheed, who said that the Bali terror, some of it, you know, military intelligence was involved.
[01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:16.233]  And that's really scary because, you know, we gather data here in Switzerland and in Germany and in other countries and in Europe we've had this false flag terrorism for a long, long time.
[01:49:16.313 --> 01:49:20.874]  We had it, for instance, in 1954 in Greece, you know.
[01:49:20.914 --> 01:49:33.056]  Some people, the Turks, from the special forces in Turkey, they went to Greece and they went to a museum which was dedicated to Kemal and they threw in a bomb and posed as Greeks.
[01:49:33.636 --> 01:49:41.719]  Now, next day, everybody got so steered up and thought, gee, these were the Greeks, you know, that the Turks and the Greeks started killing each other.
[01:49:42.139 --> 01:49:43.279]  And it was all false.
[01:49:43.399 --> 01:49:45.220]  It was a false flag operation.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:45.720]  Stay there.
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.881]  Absolutely, stay there, doctor, senator, professor.
[01:49:49.901 --> 01:49:50.481]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.521 --> 01:49:52.182]  We'll take your calls, I promise, on the other side.
[01:49:54.969 --> 01:49:57.831]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.071 --> 01:49:59.652]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.012 --> 01:50:04.675]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:09.438]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.858 --> 01:50:14.081]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.281 --> 01:50:17.123]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.203 --> 01:50:21.846]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.066 --> 01:50:26.467]  Marshall Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.707 --> 01:50:33.910]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:50:54.122 --> 01:50:56.103]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:50:56.183 --> 01:51:06.887]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:07.267 --> 01:51:11.789]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.849 --> 01:51:23.193]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.773 --> 01:51:30.616]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:31.016 --> 01:51:33.157]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:33.657 --> 01:51:38.620]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:45.082]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.103 --> 01:51:46.203]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[01:51:46.263 --> 01:51:47.103]  That's toll free!
[01:51:53.126 --> 01:51:53.787]  I think so.
[01:52:11.244 --> 01:52:11.904]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:43.862]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:49.967]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:59.514]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:00.875 --> 01:53:05.358]  Alright, John, Ron, Betsy, Kevin, everybody, we're going to your calls.
[01:53:05.479 --> 01:53:09.822]  Russ is up first, listening to us from Southern California on KCAA.
[01:53:11.323 --> 01:53:12.244]  Russ, thanks for calling.
[01:53:12.264 --> 01:53:13.244]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:53:13.264 --> 01:53:13.665]  Go ahead.
[01:53:13.965 --> 01:53:16.066]  Okay, I got three points to make.
[01:53:16.807 --> 01:53:32.857]  Now, I don't have the data with me, but back about 30 years ago, we got a CIA warning that the KGB had trained 10,000 ministers, secret agents, as Christian ministers.
[01:53:34.198 --> 01:53:37.400]  Another point, and I wonder where they're hiding.
[01:53:39.622 --> 01:53:41.403]  Right in front of us, on the boob tube.
[01:53:42.503 --> 01:53:57.011]  And then another point, it was about the, let's see, we got the KGB, and then there was a, oh, doggone, I was writing it down so I could... Well, there was the GRU.
[01:53:58.752 --> 01:53:59.732]  The TRU?
[01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:01.033]  GRU.
[01:54:02.334 --> 01:54:03.434]  Oh, I don't know about that.
[01:54:03.514 --> 01:54:06.556]  Well, I think you're bringing up the fact that the Soviets engaged in this and Dr.
[01:54:07.978 --> 01:54:08.258]  Sure.
[01:54:08.919 --> 01:54:09.699]  Oh, another thing.
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:21.686]  Oh, they bought up, they bought up Soviet block money, bought up all our publications when they were in trouble back in about the same time.
[01:54:21.706 --> 01:54:28.349]  If the point you're making is that the Soviets engaged in false flag operation, then that's true.
[01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:31.091]  They own Time, Life, Look.
[01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:34.032]  You wondering why these magazines take the slants?
[01:54:34.092 --> 01:54:34.513]  They do.
[01:54:35.893 --> 01:54:36.734]  The ministers,
[01:54:37.358 --> 01:54:41.860]  The publications, the media, the mass media, they own all that.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.981]  The Soviets had for quite a while.
[01:54:47.543 --> 01:54:55.086]  And then of course, you know, remember the Federal Reserve was what got JFK murdered.
[01:54:56.206 --> 01:54:59.368]  Because he was going to institute those silver dollars.
[01:55:00.154 --> 01:55:04.115]  Which would hit them right where they live in the interest-bearing money.
[01:55:04.195 --> 01:55:10.316]  Well, I mean, he did issue $4 billion of $44 billion of Lincoln Greenbacks, little $5 bills.
[01:55:10.396 --> 01:55:11.277]  I own several of them.
[01:55:11.677 --> 01:55:13.017]  Thank you so much for the calls, sir.
[01:55:13.037 --> 01:55:18.478]  Interesting points that you raise, and we want to thank our great affiliate out there, KCAA in Southern California.
[01:55:19.059 --> 01:55:20.619]  Comments, Professor, Doctor?
[01:55:21.411 --> 01:55:25.712]  Well, you know, this gentleman said, let's look at Russia as well.
[01:55:25.872 --> 01:55:32.333]  And what we look at, if we look at false flag in Russia, it's obviously the restart of the Chechen War.
[01:55:32.453 --> 01:55:40.394]  We had a series of bombings in Moscow before the war against Chechnya restarted in 1999.
[01:55:41.114 --> 01:55:50.256]  And there's been a lot of accusations between Putin and other Russians saying, you know, this was the Russian secret service and they posed as Chechens.
[01:55:51.136 --> 01:55:56.738]  What we have to understand is that false flag is a technique.
[01:55:56.958 --> 01:56:03.121]  It's not something this or that nation does, and this or that nation never does.
[01:56:03.321 --> 01:56:04.861]  It's something human beings do.
[01:56:05.081 --> 01:56:11.444]  Yes, Doctor, you raised Russian false flag in 1999, the four apartment bombings, three of which were carried out.
[01:56:12.026 --> 01:56:14.508]  I'm saying it could be your fault, by the way.
[01:56:14.548 --> 01:56:23.053]  Well, Moscow police caught known members of SFB with the hexogen bombs in the fourth building.
[01:56:23.073 --> 01:56:24.573]  I know that one, yeah.
[01:56:24.613 --> 01:56:26.575]  Yes, and so that's why we have that story.
[01:56:27.515 --> 01:56:30.437]  And the Chechens were saying, why would we attack you and bring your RAF down?
[01:56:30.757 --> 01:56:32.118]  They didn't have the motive.
[01:56:32.598 --> 01:56:33.039]  That's it.
[01:56:33.159 --> 01:56:39.644]  I mean, obviously, the motive thing plays a role to sort of focus, zoom in on one group or the other.
[01:56:39.704 --> 01:56:44.808]  But historically, it's always very difficult to sort of say, now we have the proof.
[01:56:44.948 --> 01:56:45.769]  Exactly.
[01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:50.092]  The official history very quickly writes, you know, it was a Chechen bombing.
[01:56:50.112 --> 01:56:53.094]  And that is obviously too imprecise.
[01:56:53.134 --> 01:56:54.956]  We must always look in more detail.
[01:56:54.976 --> 01:56:56.217]  Was it not a false flag?
[01:56:56.237 --> 01:56:56.337]  Yes.
[01:56:56.417 --> 01:56:57.698]  And if it was, how can we prove it?
[01:57:18.624 --> 01:57:21.286]  What you need to know about the New World Order's operations.
[01:57:21.847 --> 01:57:29.673]  You need to go to Infowars.com or the online video bookstore and get these films and get them now to understand the full magnitude of what we're discussing.
[01:57:30.193 --> 01:57:32.615]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.556 --> 01:57:38.220]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.964 --> 01:57:54.148]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.808 --> 01:57:55.629]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.389 --> 01:57:57.290]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.331 --> 01:58:01.614]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.134 --> 01:58:06.257]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.538 --> 01:58:10.420]  Well, time flies when you're fighting corruption.
[01:58:11.782 --> 01:58:12.982]  Already into the third hour.
[01:58:13.002 --> 01:58:15.705]  We have our guest with us for three more segments,
[01:58:18.129 --> 01:58:28.911]  Daniel Ganser, and we'll tell you how to get his book before he leaves us again, NATO's Secret Army Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.
[01:58:28.951 --> 01:58:33.552]  We're talking about false flag operations, government-sponsored terror, government-provocateur terror.
[01:58:34.312 --> 01:58:37.273]  We're about to go to John, Ron, Betsy, and others that are holding.
[01:58:38.873 --> 01:58:42.994]  But I was thinking, well, after the break I'll get into these staged demonstrations for open borders.
[01:58:43.553 --> 01:58:48.374]  Turns out the White House PR firm that Bush uses and Fox uses staged the whole thing.
[01:58:48.835 --> 01:58:49.735]  How's that false flag?
[01:58:49.755 --> 01:58:51.495]  You think this is some organic thing of immigrants?
[01:58:51.855 --> 01:58:52.175]  It's not.
[01:58:52.235 --> 01:58:53.336]  It's totally bought and paid for.
[01:58:54.476 --> 01:58:56.237]  And they don't even know it when they're taking part in it.
[01:58:56.437 --> 01:58:57.877]  A lot of times the patsies don't.
[01:58:59.478 --> 01:59:01.058]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[01:59:01.138 --> 01:59:02.038]  John, you're on the air.
[01:59:02.058 --> 01:59:02.518]  Go ahead.
[01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:07.380]  Okay, John's not there.
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.460]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:11.001]  Ron, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:11.401]  Go ahead.
[01:59:12.452 --> 01:59:12.812]  Hi Alex.
[01:59:13.793 --> 01:59:13.973]  Hi.
[01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:24.139]  I called today, my topic is something different of course than your guest, but it is something very interesting and I wonder if most of your listeners are aware of this.
[01:59:24.159 --> 01:59:38.847]  You know I noticed that there was a funny inclination on the part of the last two administrations, particularly the present and the one before to some degree, that they don't seem to utilize a veto and I thought this was kind of strange.
[01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:58.759]  So I did a little research and I found out the reason for that is that starting with Clinton and coming on like a complete waterfall with Bush, they signed something called a statement or presidential statement of intent when they sign laws, legislation into law.
[01:59:59.802 --> 02:00:14.229]  And he basically puts, you might say, a stipulation on the legislation he signs, in which he says... Yeah, you're talking about signing statements, which makes him a dictator, where he then orders the bureaucracy that he controls how to implement that.
[02:00:14.269 --> 02:00:14.709]  And I bet...
[02:00:15.692 --> 02:00:19.215]  The question of checks and balances, obviously, is the executive a runaway executive or not?
[02:00:19.235 --> 02:00:20.135]  I mean, this is a long debate.
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.681]  False flag playing to this as well.
[02:00:37.741 --> 02:00:43.402]  I wouldn't widen the topic too much because false flag is already very complicated as such.
[02:00:43.983 --> 02:00:49.944]  Obviously, checks and balances among the different branches of a government are important as well.
[02:00:50.024 --> 02:00:51.664]  If we want to go into that, we can.
[02:00:51.864 --> 02:00:52.965]  No, it's alright.
[02:00:53.305 --> 02:00:59.426]  The whole background, the whole table is set for martial law and total control and dictatorship.
[02:00:59.466 --> 02:01:02.607]  I mean, the Western world is plunging into tyranny right now.
[02:01:04.227 --> 02:01:05.788]  I don't hope so.
[02:01:05.808 --> 02:01:20.332]  I must say that if I look at it from Switzerland, I'm astonished to hear how strongly you voice it, but obviously the danger that power gets corrupted is always there.
[02:01:20.432 --> 02:01:22.633]  I agree with that part, definitely.
[02:01:24.153 --> 02:01:24.994]  Ron, anything else?
[02:01:25.634 --> 02:01:29.155]  Well, yeah, I'd like to expand a little bit on what I initially discussed.
[02:01:29.736 --> 02:01:48.384]  The problem with that is you have the President, and if you look at the signing statements, he will indicate that his intent on the understanding of how the law applies, particularly to him, his executive powers, and how it should be implemented in just about every case is in stark contrast with the Congressional legislation that's been passed.
[02:01:48.984 --> 02:01:57.168]  I mean, literally, he's using these statements to say he doesn't believe the law is applied the way it's intended to apply, and it doesn't apply to him.
[02:01:57.888 --> 02:01:58.349]  I mean, this is...
[02:01:59.929 --> 02:02:08.480]  Such a gross overreach of executive power to literally create nearly an hour... Well, Ron, I appreciate your call and I'll just add this little addendum.
[02:02:10.202 --> 02:02:12.965]  A couple months ago, Bush signed a law that wasn't even passed.
[02:02:13.065 --> 02:02:13.565]  Okay, buddy?
[02:02:14.066 --> 02:02:16.949]  He signed a $2 billion spending bill that hadn't even passed.
[02:02:17.449 --> 02:02:20.672]  He just grabbed legislation he likes and signs it without it even passing.
[02:02:21.193 --> 02:02:22.714]  So, it's classical dictatorship.
[02:02:23.175 --> 02:02:26.198]  He's announced he's allowed to order torture, even if it's illegal.
[02:02:26.218 --> 02:02:29.861]  He's announced he can spy without warrants, even if it's illegal.
[02:02:30.482 --> 02:02:33.645]  He's announced he can invade countries without congressional authorization.
[02:02:34.787 --> 02:02:36.909]  And they're exercising corrupt power.
[02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:41.212]  That's what a dictator does as they come to full dictatorial despotic power.
[02:02:41.833 --> 02:02:44.055]  And so I'll tell it like it is, we're in a dictatorship.
[02:02:45.962 --> 02:02:52.787]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:53.107 --> 02:02:54.488]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.688 --> 02:02:56.889]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:57.029 --> 02:02:59.131]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.411 --> 02:03:04.354]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.674 --> 02:03:08.697]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.957 --> 02:03:10.737]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.818 --> 02:03:21.460]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.501]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.701 --> 02:03:27.582]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[02:03:27.662 --> 02:03:29.082]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[02:03:29.122 --> 02:03:29.302]  That's 888-2533139.
[02:03:36.044 --> 02:03:39.432]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:03:39.452 --> 02:03:40.816]  I'll give them that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:03:46.673 --> 02:03:51.157]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.517 --> 02:03:55.600]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.901 --> 02:03:56.441]  We listened.
[02:03:56.761 --> 02:04:01.746]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.006 --> 02:04:02.506]  We listened.
[02:04:02.887 --> 02:04:05.929]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.349 --> 02:04:06.870]  We listened.
[02:04:07.330 --> 02:04:11.394]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.774 --> 02:04:12.274]  We listened.
[02:04:12.615 --> 02:04:17.859]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.621]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.001 --> 02:04:27.367]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.768 --> 02:04:31.211]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[02:04:37.233 --> 02:04:38.196]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:38.216 --> 02:04:39.881]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:52.535]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:52.695 --> 02:05:05.606]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.

[02:05:47.282 --> 02:05:53.308]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.908 --> 02:05:56.951]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.454 --> 02:06:02.336]  Dr. Daniel Ganser is our guest.
[02:06:02.356 --> 02:06:06.539]  He's the author of NACO's Secret Army, Operation Gladio, and Terrorism in Western Europe.
[02:06:08.541 --> 02:06:12.385]  And he has... Well, I'm not going to get into his whole bio.
[02:06:13.661 --> 02:06:26.726]  Of course, he's a professor of history and several other disciplines and has been involved at the highest levels of the strategy and advising major organizations, institutions, but we're not going to cover all that.
[02:06:27.986 --> 02:06:33.828]  I want to take calls, and we're taking calls while he's with us, and we're asking the callers if they're calling in on topic, and they're not.
[02:06:34.528 --> 02:06:39.250]  I'll still take your calls, but it'd be nice if you'd stay focused on this issue because it's so important.
[02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:45.753]  It's just incredibly foundational to everything we're going through right now, and it's complex in and of itself.
[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:51.953]  As the professor, the doctor, was just saying.
[02:06:51.973 --> 02:06:52.553]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:52.573 --> 02:06:54.954]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number.
[02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:58.676]  Doctor, let's get into some more of the terror events carried out.
[02:06:58.716 --> 02:06:59.897]  You mentioned Indonesia.
[02:07:00.237 --> 02:07:01.337]  What about Latin America?
[02:07:01.397 --> 02:07:03.498]  Some of the other things that happened in Italy.
[02:07:03.538 --> 02:07:05.679]  The Bologna bombing in 1980.
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:10.922]  Let's go through some of those, if you'd like, and then cover any other topics you'd like to discuss.
[02:07:10.942 --> 02:07:12.943]  Then we'll go to Betsy and Kevin and others.
[02:07:13.523 --> 02:07:16.025]  Yeah, we're doing a false flag world tour here, right?
[02:07:16.065 --> 02:07:26.693]  I mean, we went to Italy, we took something from the U.S., we went to England, had Israel, we were in Iran together, and maybe we should look at Japan for a moment.
[02:07:27.934 --> 02:07:32.637]  We must think back again to the beginning of the Second World War.
[02:07:32.757 --> 02:07:38.942]  It started in 39 in Europe, but it started earlier than that in Asia, Southeast Asia.
[02:07:38.962 --> 02:07:39.462]  The moment
[02:07:40.203 --> 02:07:42.645]  Where you had a false flag there was in 1931.
[02:07:43.105 --> 02:07:55.392]  The situation was such that Japan, the island, was facing China, the mainland, and China had this really interesting territory which Japan wanted to grasp.
[02:07:55.942 --> 02:08:12.379]  So, with the Japanese, they went over to the other side of that little bit of a sea there, really, and staged and inched it, and they blew up a bit of peace there in Mukden, a railway road, and imposed the Chinese, and then the next day they said, you know, the Chinese
[02:08:12.959 --> 02:08:15.140]  Have attacked us there and we must go there.
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.202]  It's always the same simple pattern and you know, it's not something small.
[02:08:19.262 --> 02:08:23.544]  This was the start of the Second World War over there in Japan and China.
[02:08:24.005 --> 02:08:28.987]  But it's always something very small and it seems not so important.
[02:08:29.027 --> 02:08:34.610]  But if you look at it in detail, you will find out that false flag operations can have very grave consequences.
[02:08:35.376 --> 02:08:44.920]  And in hindsight, 70-something years later, it's admitted, Japan later admitted that they had staged an attack on their own railway and blamed it on the Chinese.
[02:08:45.321 --> 02:08:46.761]  Yeah, because they were defeated.
[02:08:47.782 --> 02:08:48.262]  Then you admit.
[02:08:49.273 --> 02:08:51.074]  And what about Latin America?
[02:08:51.094 --> 02:08:55.115]  We've seen a lot of examples of governments carrying out attacks there to blame it on their enemies.
[02:08:55.815 --> 02:08:59.896]  Yeah, I don't know too much of the data in Latin America.
[02:08:59.936 --> 02:09:08.459]  The other obviously very famous one is the one with Cuba, the fight between the US and Cuba with Operation Northwood.
[02:09:08.479 --> 02:09:10.059]  But that's already very well known.
[02:09:10.119 --> 02:09:13.480]  This was the strategy of the Pentagon to say, let's have
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:22.985]  A few terrorist attacks and then blow down a shoot down them a drone which is an unnamed aircraft and then blame it on Costa to have a pretext for an invasion.
[02:09:23.485 --> 02:09:33.010]  This is probably the largest or best known in the Latin American context, but we do have data also from from the Pinochet years.
[02:09:34.637 --> 02:09:36.618]  In the Guatemala and Honduras conflicts.
[02:09:36.658 --> 02:09:41.639]  I don't know the specifics right now of the cause.
[02:09:41.699 --> 02:09:43.180]  You're an extreme expert on Italy.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:48.381]  Let's talk about a few other cases in Italy of false flag and then some of the people that went public exposing it.
[02:09:50.122 --> 02:09:54.723]  One of the most important sources that we have in Italy is Vincenzo Vinci Guerra.
[02:09:55.223 --> 02:09:57.784]  He was a member of Orgine Nuovo, which is
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:04.466]  A Catholic neo-fascist organization, and you know, he went on trial and he said, yes, okay, it's true.
[02:10:04.586 --> 02:10:08.410]  I, I did this peteano attack in 1972.
[02:10:09.071 --> 02:10:12.034]  And then he said, and guess what?
[02:10:12.054 --> 02:10:13.796]  You know, the military secret service,
[02:10:14.276 --> 02:10:15.817]  They backed me.
[02:10:15.937 --> 02:10:20.518]  After I did it, they packed me into a plane and flew me over to Franco.
[02:10:20.598 --> 02:10:22.599]  Obviously, Franco was a fascist dictator.
[02:10:22.919 --> 02:10:27.380]  So he was sealed off from, you know, nobody could touch him there.
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:39.504]  And then later on trial, he said, you know, people asked him, but okay, then you were an actor for the state and people were very confused because they say, okay, I give taxes to the state and I hope that the state protects me.
[02:10:40.384 --> 02:10:44.486]  And then they asked him, will the state now apologize?
[02:10:44.506 --> 02:10:51.130]  And he said, no, the state probably can never admit that he did this and that he backed me in this.
[02:10:51.190 --> 02:10:53.391]  And so people in Italy are rather cynical.
[02:10:54.011 --> 02:10:56.092]  That's the problem in the end that you really have.
[02:10:57.648 --> 02:11:01.971]  Dr. Ganser, I want to take some calls, but I first want to ask you, how did you first wake up the false flag?
[02:11:01.991 --> 02:11:13.037]  I mean, was it when you were getting your doctorate in college, or when did you begin to discover this, and then what was it like when you found out that so much of history that you've been told was really a facade?
[02:11:28.429 --> 02:11:34.733]  Yeah, I was still a student of history, and somebody told me, look at Gladio.
[02:11:34.873 --> 02:11:36.113]  And I thought, Gladio?
[02:11:36.134 --> 02:11:36.974]  What's that anyway?
[02:11:37.034 --> 02:11:43.998]  I knew that Gladio is this guy who fights in the old Roman times.
[02:11:44.038 --> 02:11:44.838]  They fought each other.
[02:11:44.878 --> 02:11:49.801]  And then I started to look at this, and I said, yeah, I want to research this more.
[02:11:49.841 --> 02:11:51.842]  And none of my professors knew about it.
[02:11:54.163 --> 02:11:55.645]  That was really in a waking point.
[02:11:55.705 --> 02:11:59.229]  I was then at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK.
[02:12:00.699 --> 02:12:03.582]  I was really stunned that most people don't know anything about it.
[02:12:03.602 --> 02:12:07.606]  So the professors, all of those I really looked up to and thought they know everything.
[02:12:08.146 --> 02:12:09.067]  They knew a lot.
[02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:12.830]  They knew a lot about the Suez Conflict, about the OPEC embargo.
[02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:15.533]  They knew a lot about globalization, world trade.
[02:12:15.893 --> 02:12:17.455]  They were really knowledgeable people.
[02:12:17.495 --> 02:12:23.600]  But when it came to dirty tricks, false flag operation and special forces, they had no knowledge.
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:24.921]  So they couldn't give it to us.
[02:12:24.961 --> 02:12:26.723]  And so I tried to find it myself.
[02:12:28.425 --> 02:12:31.287]  And the rabbit hole was indeed deep and dark.
[02:12:32.068 --> 02:12:33.409]  It was more dark than I thought, yeah.
[02:12:33.429 --> 02:12:42.675]  Alright, I'm going to take a few calls, folks, but I'd specifically like you to call in and talk about false flag government sponsored terror 1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:43.095 --> 02:12:45.137]  Let's go to Betty in Florida.
[02:12:45.557 --> 02:12:46.898]  Betty, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:12:46.918 --> 02:12:47.999]  Hello.
[02:12:48.559 --> 02:12:48.839]  Yes.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:50.761]  Alex, it's Betsy.
[02:12:51.541 --> 02:12:55.804]  I have one question for you and I have another question for the doctor.
[02:12:57.816 --> 02:13:10.105]  The first thing I wanted to bring up was, and I know you've addressed this, but how best do you think that we can support Cynthia McKinney right now in this supposed arrest that's going to happen?
[02:13:10.826 --> 02:13:12.727]  Well, I mean, you talk about a false flag.
[02:13:12.867 --> 02:13:14.208]  They've been harassing her.
[02:13:14.248 --> 02:13:15.690]  She'd already told me about this privately.
[02:13:15.710 --> 02:13:17.431]  We had her on as a guest on TV and radio.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.061]  And they would shove on her and grab on her.
[02:13:20.081 --> 02:13:22.763]  The guy grabbed on her, she turned and bumped into him.
[02:13:23.163 --> 02:13:24.744]  Then they claimed they had surveillance camera.
[02:13:24.764 --> 02:13:25.704]  Now they admit they don't.
[02:13:26.084 --> 02:13:29.686]  And now they're talking about, uh, you know, indicting her and have indicted her and are going after her.
[02:13:30.187 --> 02:13:36.890]  And it's just, uh, the Capitol Hill police are harassing anybody that doesn't go along with Bush or under his control.
[02:13:37.491 --> 02:13:41.313]  And we should just call for the grand jury to drop any indictments and to leave her alone.
[02:13:46.169 --> 02:13:49.051]  There's a few people who's really standing up for us and what we believe in.
[02:13:49.571 --> 02:13:59.256]  We should probably make an all-out effort to do whatever we can to flood her office with letters of support or flood the offices of our own congresspeople.
[02:13:59.496 --> 02:14:02.538]  Okay, what's your question for the guest?
[02:14:03.178 --> 02:14:15.525]  I wanted to ask him, because I didn't hear him touch upon this, does he think that assassinations, such as of JFK, fall into this false flag category?
[02:14:18.018 --> 02:14:18.979]  No, not actually.
[02:14:19.079 --> 02:14:28.529]  Assassinations eliminate the opponent, whereas false flags are actually to discredit the opponent and scare everybody else.
[02:14:29.050 --> 02:14:32.093]  It's a bit of a different strategy.
[02:14:32.533 --> 02:14:36.197]  I think she means blaming patsies like Oswald.
[02:14:36.217 --> 02:14:37.519]  Like Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:14:38.027 --> 02:14:38.688]  That way.
[02:14:38.748 --> 02:14:47.761]  Well, what you do have as a similarity is that obviously both involve violence, like assassination and false flag usually involve violence.
[02:14:48.231 --> 02:14:52.454]  And they both, in many ways, often involve lying.
[02:14:52.875 --> 02:15:03.383]  But still, you know, it is very important to say that false flags, specifically, I would really say false flags, need a sort of a terrorist attack.
[02:15:03.503 --> 02:15:07.166]  If you want, you can take assassination in it, but I classically don't.
[02:15:07.607 --> 02:15:11.149]  It's basically how you differentiate the terms.
[02:15:11.230 --> 02:15:13.511]  Obviously, assassinations are an important point as well.
[02:15:13.792 --> 02:15:15.113]  Betsy, I appreciate your call.
[02:15:15.813 --> 02:15:16.654]  Let me add to that.
[02:15:17.475 --> 02:15:20.698]  The way I look at it is there's different types of false flag.
[02:15:20.718 --> 02:15:26.784]  You have the classical flying a false color for whatever reason on your ship or your uniform or your tank or whatever.
[02:15:26.864 --> 02:15:37.193]  Then you have false flag where you frame Patsy's or you have the false flag that police officers or police detectives listening right now have had where they pose as a drug dealer and go out and sell drugs.
[02:15:37.453 --> 02:15:41.137]  We're talking about governmental terror related false flag.
[02:15:41.955 --> 02:15:46.418]  And it's not only, I mean, we must be very precise in this matter, because it's very complicated.
[02:15:46.458 --> 02:15:48.520]  It's not only governments that use false flags.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.781]  Private corporations do.
[02:15:49.901 --> 02:15:59.107]  Yeah, I mean, you know, every human being can use a false flag if he wants to, but it is, it has not been decided that the government use false flags.
[02:15:59.127 --> 02:15:59.568]  Sure, sure.
[02:15:59.608 --> 02:16:00.989]  Really, it's called a frame-up.
[02:16:01.769 --> 02:16:02.049]  Yeah.
[02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.670]  Yeah.
[02:16:04.231 --> 02:16:10.415]  So we could boil false flag down to frame-ups, where I don't like somebody, so I plant drugs on them and call the cops.
[02:16:11.116 --> 02:16:11.296]  Yeah.
[02:16:12.614 --> 02:16:13.915]  Yeah, true indeed.
[02:16:14.635 --> 02:16:17.036]  Alright, let's talk to Kevin in Alabama.
[02:16:17.056 --> 02:16:18.176]  Kevin, you're on the air with our guests.
[02:16:18.196 --> 02:16:18.717]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:16:19.477 --> 02:16:20.157]  Hey, how y'all doing?
[02:16:20.718 --> 02:16:21.078]  Good, sir.
[02:16:21.758 --> 02:16:34.123]  Alright, uh, I called in about two days ago, and I have a question for the doctor, but, uh, I called in about two days ago, and I said, uh, I saw Charlie, I have pictures of Charlie Sheen at Illuminati meetings.
[02:16:34.343 --> 02:16:36.024]  Okay, what Illuminati meeting was that, sir?
[02:16:36.484 --> 02:16:37.905]  It was the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:16:38.125 --> 02:16:40.286]  If you, if you watch the History Channel,
[02:16:41.807 --> 02:16:44.428]  And watch their little shows on Secret Societies.
[02:16:44.728 --> 02:16:45.328]  You'll see them.
[02:16:45.348 --> 02:16:46.229]  Alright?
[02:16:46.509 --> 02:16:48.209]  That is totally false.
[02:16:48.269 --> 02:16:54.452]  That is totally... Well, then I tell you to produce... Sir, sir, I challenge you to produce the clip.
[02:16:55.052 --> 02:16:56.252]  Okay, you want me to produce it?
[02:16:56.272 --> 02:16:57.433]  The name of the show, at least.
[02:16:58.153 --> 02:16:59.874]  It is Secret Societies.
[02:17:00.754 --> 02:17:06.416]  It has come on two or three times in the last four or five years on the History Channel.
[02:17:07.330 --> 02:17:09.411]  Are you sure you're not talking about Martin Sheen?
[02:17:09.931 --> 02:17:10.231]  Sir!
[02:17:10.732 --> 02:17:11.072]  Stop!
[02:17:11.112 --> 02:17:11.352]  Sir!
[02:17:11.372 --> 02:17:11.692]  Sir!
[02:17:11.772 --> 02:17:12.032]  Sir!
[02:17:12.432 --> 02:17:13.173]  Martin Sheen!
[02:17:13.453 --> 02:17:14.493]  Are you talking about Martin Sheen?
[02:17:14.934 --> 02:17:15.754]  Charlie Sheen.
[02:17:15.854 --> 02:17:16.895]  Well I'll call him and ask him.
[02:17:18.015 --> 02:17:21.237]  But you've called before sir and it's usually pretty ridiculous so I appreciate your call.
[02:17:21.597 --> 02:17:24.438]  Sorry if I don't just jump on whatever you're saying.
[02:17:25.719 --> 02:17:27.960]  But I'd be glad if he'd been to that and was now going public.
[02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:28.640]  That'd be wonderful.
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:31.962]  Yeah, that's exactly who they invite to it is Charlie Sheen.
[02:17:32.682 --> 02:17:34.883]  Oh please, this is just unbelievable.
[02:17:35.928 --> 02:17:37.092]  You gotta love those type of calls.
[02:17:37.272 --> 02:17:38.776]  Sorry about that, Doctor.
[02:17:38.856 --> 02:17:40.641]  We'll come back and take some more calls.
[02:17:46.149 --> 02:17:47.830]  What causes foods to spoil?
[02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:51.231]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[02:17:51.572 --> 02:17:56.854]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[02:17:57.154 --> 02:18:06.679]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[02:18:06.959 --> 02:18:09.160]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:13.003]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:18:13.263 --> 02:18:16.486]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:18:16.766 --> 02:18:20.309]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:23.952]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:18:24.072 --> 02:18:25.334]  I'm really amazed.
[02:18:25.494 --> 02:18:31.339]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:18:31.479 --> 02:18:33.901]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:42.365]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.

[02:19:04.833 --> 02:19:06.875]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[02:19:07.295 --> 02:19:08.896]  They are instruments of death.
[02:19:09.076 --> 02:19:11.138]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[02:20:45.727 --> 02:20:46.547]  Come on, Bill.
[02:20:46.768 --> 02:20:48.589]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[02:20:48.789 --> 02:20:51.952]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:20:52.272 --> 02:20:52.853]  What did you do?
[02:20:52.953 --> 02:20:53.753]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:20:53.873 --> 02:20:55.855]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:20:56.115 --> 02:21:01.640]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:08.205]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:21:08.525 --> 02:21:10.747]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:21:11.048 --> 02:21:13.910]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[02:21:14.390 --> 02:21:17.832]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[02:21:18.092 --> 02:21:18.473]  Whoa!
[02:21:18.873 --> 02:21:20.094]  What was that website again?
[02:21:20.174 --> 02:21:23.656]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:21:23.936 --> 02:21:25.076]  Now write this down, John.
[02:21:25.196 --> 02:21:29.499]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:21:29.659 --> 02:21:30.239]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:31.700]  I'm going there right now.
[02:21:32.121 --> 02:21:32.761]  Check, please!
[02:21:34.541 --> 02:21:36.002]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:21:36.483 --> 02:21:37.083]  Sure, John.
[02:21:37.303 --> 02:21:41.666]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:21:41.966 --> 02:21:43.648]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:21:43.828 --> 02:21:44.148]  Deal.
[02:21:50.852 --> 02:21:52.414]  I want to try to twist our guest's arm.
[02:21:52.434 --> 02:21:53.174]  I haven't asked him yet.
[02:21:53.434 --> 02:21:55.496]  Stay a few minutes into the next segment, maybe five minutes.
[02:21:56.256 --> 02:22:00.319]  Because that'd be a total of under 12 or so, so we can finish up talking about his book itself.
[02:22:00.339 --> 02:22:01.540]  But I want to take a few calls right now.
[02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:05.954]  Fred in South Dakota has a question, so does Fred in Philadelphia, for our guest specifically.
[02:22:06.354 --> 02:22:07.875]  Let's skip ahead to Thomas in Tennessee.
[02:22:07.895 --> 02:22:12.936]  He says he can shed some light on the conspiracy shows, supposedly on, what did he say, discovery or history?
[02:22:12.956 --> 02:22:16.617]  He says something about Sheen, which just sounds ridiculous to me.
[02:22:17.317 --> 02:22:19.998]  Thomas, can you shed some light on what the last caller was saying?
[02:22:20.618 --> 02:22:23.639]  Yeah, I just thought that was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[02:22:24.299 --> 02:22:28.060]  I'll just make a little comparison.
[02:22:28.878 --> 02:22:35.081]  When the Pharisees and the scribes came to Jesus and accused him of having a demon, he said, why would Satan cast out himself?
[02:22:35.881 --> 02:22:39.083]  Why in the world would the Illuminati be killing on themselves?
[02:22:39.163 --> 02:22:45.906]  You know, the government gave us an ulterior tale as to what really happened.
[02:22:47.506 --> 02:22:48.767]  What's his reasoning for this?
[02:22:49.047 --> 02:22:52.108]  To make us believe that it was the terrorists that did this?
[02:22:52.188 --> 02:22:54.069]  I mean, this does not make any sense.
[02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.770]  You know?
[02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:57.151]  It's like reverse psychology.
[02:22:57.291 --> 02:22:57.931]  You know, giving us
[02:22:58.896 --> 02:23:04.997]  Um, giving us a fake story to believe what they, you know, give us a real story to believe what...
[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:06.501]  The government tells us?
[02:23:06.561 --> 02:23:07.882]  I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
[02:23:07.982 --> 02:23:09.983]  Why in the world would he tell on himself?
[02:23:10.303 --> 02:23:10.584]  You know?
[02:23:10.884 --> 02:23:17.268]  Well, I mean, his father is in high up political circles, and he's always exposing DU, the war, he's against everything they're doing.
[02:23:17.749 --> 02:23:23.213]  I mean, I guess there's some slight chance they do invite a few actors every once in a while, but I sincerely doubt it.
[02:23:23.333 --> 02:23:25.835]  I'll definitely try to check it, though, and find out, believe me.
[02:23:26.115 --> 02:23:27.035]  I'm already looking into it.
[02:23:27.776 --> 02:23:28.657]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:23:28.997 --> 02:23:31.238]  Let's talk to Fred in South Dakota for our guest.
[02:23:31.258 --> 02:23:31.859]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:23:33.174 --> 02:23:33.714]  How are you doing?
[02:23:33.994 --> 02:23:34.314]  Good, Jim.
[02:23:34.334 --> 02:23:36.055]  Yes, I got a good question for the doctor.
[02:23:37.755 --> 02:24:01.123]  Well, when one's dealing, and he stated earlier that his professors were ignorant of some of the information he has, and my question is, when the information does come out, and he does have the sources, and he does have the evidence, and you prove a part of it wrong, and he presents it to the academia,
[02:24:03.825 --> 02:24:04.727]  Did they resist it?
[02:24:05.207 --> 02:24:08.572]  Because I've found an awful lot of resistance in academia.
[02:24:09.215 --> 02:24:13.777]  Well, let me say this, now I don't find as much resistance.
[02:24:13.817 --> 02:24:15.418]  He's talking about decades ago.
[02:24:16.158 --> 02:24:20.980]  We're talking about now there not being as much resistance, because back then it was pretty much unknown.
[02:24:21.281 --> 02:24:22.821]  But let me have the doctor answer.
[02:24:22.861 --> 02:24:23.121]  Doctor?
[02:24:24.602 --> 02:24:30.085]  Partly yes, there is resistance, but partly no, because there is also curiosity.
[02:24:30.245 --> 02:24:31.165]  It's basically both.
[02:24:31.205 --> 02:24:35.247]  What we do have is obviously if you publish in an academic journal, it's peer-reviewed.
[02:24:35.908 --> 02:24:42.411]  And those peers, colleagues, can only judge the paper from their level of knowledge.
[02:24:42.451 --> 02:24:56.338]  And if you come in with a new set of data, with new sources, new paradigms really, obviously false flags is something that has not been discussed in international history thoroughly for the last 30 years.
[02:24:58.359 --> 02:25:02.721]  So there were, you know, some papers were not published, but then others were published.
[02:25:02.781 --> 02:25:04.583]  Yeah, I found... What can I say?
[02:25:04.643 --> 02:25:06.864]  Yeah, there is resistance, but there is also support.
[02:25:06.884 --> 02:25:15.129]  Yeah, I found a lot of... I mean, to answer my point of view on this, I have found a lot of peer-reviewed papers out there by some professors around the world.
[02:25:15.970 --> 02:25:17.931]  It's just very, very rare until now.
[02:25:18.706 --> 02:25:27.068]  That's true, but I think we are also in this phase in a very, very changing world because many, many academics wake up to this reality of false flag operation.
[02:25:27.108 --> 02:25:29.188]  It's no longer disputed that they exist.
[02:25:30.108 --> 02:25:33.129]  The dispute is really, which one is the false flag?
[02:25:33.189 --> 02:25:34.009]  Where do we know it?
[02:25:34.069 --> 02:25:34.829]  What was the date?
[02:25:34.889 --> 02:25:35.849]  What was the country?
[02:25:36.189 --> 02:25:38.530]  Who was, what was the strategic framework?
[02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:41.350]  And you, we travel the globe and then search every bit.
[02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:42.711]  Let's take another call.
[02:25:42.771 --> 02:25:44.271]  Fred in Philadelphia, you're on the air.
[02:25:47.405 --> 02:26:03.011]  I got an example of Egypt faking a murder of a Libyan exile and tricking Libya into claiming that the man had been, quote, executed to liquidate the enemies of the revolution.
[02:26:03.091 --> 02:26:08.713]  So they can do it, fake a murder, fake a kidnapping.
[02:26:08.753 --> 02:26:10.174]  And what's been going on in Iraq?
[02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:16.624]  As possibly the fingerprints of that all over it.
[02:26:16.844 --> 02:26:19.186]  What was that specific case?
[02:26:20.587 --> 02:26:38.022]  Well, it was in 85 and there was a gentleman who was... They took the four assassins into custody and then pretended to...
[02:26:40.142 --> 02:26:46.704]  To kill this Libyan exile, took a photograph and sent it to Libya, or somehow Libya got it.
[02:26:47.484 --> 02:26:52.166]  And then Libya, of course, came out with a press release.
[02:26:52.186 --> 02:27:02.169]  A press agency said that Bakush had been, quote, executed by a team established to liquidate the enemies of the revolution.
[02:27:02.189 --> 02:27:06.470]  And then, of course, Egypt stepped forward and said Bakush was alive.
[02:27:07.530 --> 02:27:13.976]  Uh, a peer, a gentleman, who's appeared at a press conference and, you know, they got hay out of that.
[02:27:14.696 --> 02:27:16.358]  Can we do a few more minutes, Doctor?
[02:27:17.259 --> 02:27:20.001]  Just a few more, yeah, like five more and then we'd have to go.
[02:27:20.121 --> 02:27:23.043]  Great, I want to get your comment on that and then finish up on the other side.
[02:27:23.083 --> 02:27:23.544]  We'll do that.
[02:27:23.564 --> 02:27:24.645]  It's been a great honor to have you.
[02:27:24.925 --> 02:27:25.505]  Thank you, caller.
[02:27:25.746 --> 02:27:28.488]  And then we'll take more calls and cover other news items on the other side.
[02:27:28.928 --> 02:27:30.530]  One more quick little segment with our guest.
[02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:31.951]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.528 --> 02:27:39.512]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.453 --> 02:27:43.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:53.284]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.504 --> 02:27:58.507]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.827 --> 02:28:06.732]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.892 --> 02:28:13.936]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:14.156 --> 02:28:15.377]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:15.517 --> 02:28:18.898]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.958 --> 02:28:21.639]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.839 --> 02:28:28.682]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:28.782 --> 02:28:31.243]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:34.548 --> 02:28:35.390]  One more time that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.485 --> 02:28:50.386]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:50.626 --> 02:28:56.047]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:56.327 --> 02:29:06.689]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:06.849 --> 02:29:11.190]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:11.390 --> 02:29:12.210]  Try Halo Methane.
[02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:19.735]  And volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.

[02:30:57.828 --> 02:31:08.901]  This isn't an example of a government sponsored terror or provocateur false flag, but it is an example of false flag under the definition that has really four different subgroups.
[02:31:09.841 --> 02:31:13.825]  Over and over again we'll hear about an Al-Qaeda operative being arrested, and it's a big victory.
[02:31:13.865 --> 02:31:15.667]  We've got number three, number two, number four.
[02:31:16.227 --> 02:31:25.095]  Oh, he's giving us lots of intelligence about how bin Laden carried out 9-11, how they're going to get us any minute, and, you know, bin Laden's scared of George Bush and thinks he's so forceful.
[02:31:25.136 --> 02:31:30.721]  You know, they always say what just sounds perfect to the propagandist ears.
[02:31:32.475 --> 02:31:44.180]  But there have been countless examples, and there's been scores of them, where then it comes out six months later, five months later, two years later, that, oh, they were just staging the arrest of a U.S.
[02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:55.544]  government asset working for the CIA or MI6 or Defense Intelligence, so that when they brought him into custody out of, quote, Al-Qaeda, to protect him,
[02:31:57.428 --> 02:32:00.014]  Really, they were government agents and they just staged the arrest.
[02:32:01.197 --> 02:32:04.204]  Professor, Doctor, have you seen any examples of that in your own studies?
[02:32:05.971 --> 02:32:12.115]  I didn't focus on these too much because if there were no dead, I didn't take it up into the data set.
[02:32:12.135 --> 02:32:14.556]  You know, it really had to be a bomb killing people.
[02:32:14.596 --> 02:32:21.300]  But what it burns down to really is that false flag operations exist and it means we can be fooled.
[02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:31.506]  But there's one point I don't want to leave it at that because it could be that people, you know, I've said that false flag operations are designed to increase fear.
[02:32:32.313 --> 02:32:43.537]  Now, information like this, you know, that false flag operations exist, can also increase fear, and that would be the one thing I'd really like to hint at, that that is not the purpose.
[02:32:43.597 --> 02:32:52.279]  We should really say, okay, now we know it, they do exist, but we should not get stuck into fear, because that would be the counter, that would be just the opposite of what I want to do.
[02:32:52.379 --> 02:32:59.061]  I want to say they exist, and we have to steer clear from being tricked into violence.
[02:32:59.161 --> 02:33:00.582]  That's really the main message.
[02:33:01.514 --> 02:33:02.335]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:33:02.375 --> 02:33:25.851]  I've said many times that my broadcast may help the New World Order, may help the Anglo-American Empire, but if people take away from it fear, instead of taking away from it that we can change the world, we can affect change, we can expose false flag, and then take that tool out of their repertoire, take that tool out of their satchel of dirty tricks, we're trying to save lives here.
[02:33:25.871 --> 02:33:28.733]  This is a positive thing, and that we shouldn't have fear.
[02:33:29.573 --> 02:33:34.734]  That's true, because you know, I'm having the same thing when I teach a class of history students here in Switzerland.
[02:33:34.974 --> 02:33:54.418]  I sort of explain them, they're between 20 and 25, and I explain them that these things happen, that we have the data, and the first phase they really go through is one of disappointment, you know, that it's so bad, and then the second phase they go into is a phase of resignation, they go, you know, then it's basically lost, what can we do?
[02:33:55.419 --> 02:33:58.922]  And only the third phase is that they then look at their own emotions.
[02:33:59.042 --> 02:34:00.924]  That's really what everybody has to do.
[02:34:00.964 --> 02:34:18.961]  He has to look at his own emotion, realize that he's being steered by fear, and he has to unplug that steering wheel and say, okay, then I just have to steer clear of violence and sort of find my way without, you know, getting involved in killings and terror and war.
[02:34:19.628 --> 02:34:23.431]  What do your colleagues think in the different circles you're in, sir?
[02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:26.172]  What do they think of your work?
[02:34:26.292 --> 02:34:32.877]  Some think it's great, and some think I'm making too much noise and saying, you know, you shouldn't talk about this.
[02:34:33.037 --> 02:34:36.979]  This is really delicate, that's what some say.
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:41.102]  And it is delicate, but you know, as academics, we have to be honest.
[02:34:42.803 --> 02:34:44.864]  Bring out the facts, and we shouldn't filter them.
[02:34:45.044 --> 02:34:53.267]  We shouldn't just, you know, tell stories that are true, and don't tell other stories that we know that are true, because we don't tell them because they're ugly.
[02:34:53.967 --> 02:34:56.228]  We should try to be honest, like everybody else.
[02:34:56.448 --> 02:35:08.833]  Well, he's a professor, he's a doctor, he's Daniel Ganser, and we really appreciate you joining us, sir, and your book is NATO's Secret Armies, Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.
[02:35:09.634 --> 02:35:12.316]  And folks, you can go to Amazon.com and get it.
[02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:15.237]  We'll put a link to it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:15.617 --> 02:35:16.918]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:35:17.598 --> 02:35:17.798]  No.
[02:35:18.179 --> 02:35:18.719]  No, that's it.
[02:35:19.611 --> 02:35:21.032]  Well, I hope you're happy with the interview.
[02:35:21.052 --> 02:35:22.533]  I think it's been a great exchange of ideas.
[02:35:22.554 --> 02:35:23.254]  Yeah, my pleasure.
[02:35:23.574 --> 02:35:32.202]  And I've learned a lot, and I want to thank you for your bold courage in defending our civilization from its darker side.
[02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:44.692]  I want to thank you for the future of my children, because I think with men like you and women like yourself out there fighting on the front lines, that we're going to cause a revolution or a revelation, a renaissance of understanding.
[02:35:45.251 --> 02:35:46.751]  Yeah, Renaissance of Understanding.
[02:35:46.771 --> 02:35:47.392]  I like that one.
[02:35:47.432 --> 02:35:50.172]  And I think it's important to emphasize that there are loads of us.
[02:35:50.272 --> 02:35:53.513]  I mean, you know, let's not get shocked and let's not get despaired.
[02:35:53.533 --> 02:35:57.634]  There's lots of people who think, you know, enough with these lies and pretentious.
[02:35:58.414 --> 02:35:59.414]  We did it for some time.
[02:35:59.434 --> 02:35:59.955]  It didn't work.
[02:36:00.355 --> 02:36:01.175]  Let's do something else.
[02:36:01.355 --> 02:36:05.136]  That's the best news I take from this interview is that you're getting the same feedback I'm getting.
[02:36:05.156 --> 02:36:06.316]  People are really waking up to this.
[02:36:06.496 --> 02:36:07.596]  We'll talk to you soon, Doctor.
[02:36:08.157 --> 02:36:08.637]  Thanks a lot.
[02:36:08.737 --> 02:36:09.657]  You have a good time.
[02:36:09.677 --> 02:36:10.237]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:36:11.157 --> 02:36:12.858]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:12.878 --> 02:36:13.918]  He goes with God, I hope.
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:16.421]  Amazing interview.
[02:36:17.242 --> 02:36:17.702]  Amazing.
[02:36:17.742 --> 02:36:18.243]  I learned a lot.
[02:36:18.283 --> 02:36:19.744]  Did you learn a lot?
[02:36:20.324 --> 02:36:21.105]  That's what I do every day.
[02:36:21.125 --> 02:36:21.585]  This is what we do.
[02:36:21.645 --> 02:36:22.186]  We research.
[02:36:22.226 --> 02:36:22.626]  We fight.
[02:36:22.686 --> 02:36:23.467]  We interface.
[02:36:23.527 --> 02:36:26.069]  We work with people.
[02:36:26.149 --> 02:36:27.710]  We research.
[02:36:28.591 --> 02:36:30.012]  And that's a great person.
[02:36:30.032 --> 02:36:31.273]  I really enjoyed that discussion.
[02:36:31.293 --> 02:36:34.056]  I enjoyed that interview a lot.
[02:36:34.156 --> 02:36:35.016]  Let's take calls.
[02:36:35.076 --> 02:36:37.979]  And I'll also have a smattering of some other news we haven't hit here before we end.
[02:36:38.359 --> 02:36:40.481]  We've got exactly 41 minutes, 5 seconds left.
[02:36:41.161 --> 02:36:43.483]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Indiana.
[02:36:43.503 --> 02:36:44.084]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:45.692]  How you doing today?
[02:36:45.872 --> 02:36:46.253]  Good, sir.
[02:36:46.734 --> 02:36:50.280]  Hey, uh, I got a couple statements to make, then I got a question.
[02:36:50.841 --> 02:36:55.089]  My two statements was that, uh, Bin Laden was trained by CIA.
[02:36:55.109 --> 02:36:56.632]  He used to be a CIA agent.
[02:36:57.093 --> 02:36:57.274]  Yes.
[02:36:58.161 --> 02:37:02.784]  And, uh, on the, uh, terrorists, there were seven of the eight terrorists that are still alive.
[02:37:03.244 --> 02:37:04.105]  BBC, yes.
[02:37:04.485 --> 02:37:04.845]  Yeah.
[02:37:05.265 --> 02:37:12.910]  Then, uh, the question last night I, I couldn't figure out is why are we building 14 bases, military bases in Iraq?
[02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:14.431]  Well, that's 14 big ones.
[02:37:14.451 --> 02:37:16.572]  There's over a hundred satellite bases as well.
[02:37:17.132 --> 02:37:18.853]  One of them holds 6,000 employees.
[02:37:18.893 --> 02:37:20.975]  They're giant armored extermination towers.
[02:37:21.755 --> 02:37:24.817]  These are just citadels to conduct the extermination and the genocide from.
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:27.723]  Oh, so he is going that direction.
[02:37:27.743 --> 02:37:28.884]  Oh man, we've got to stop that.
[02:37:28.904 --> 02:37:29.986]  I don't know what to do to stop it.
[02:37:30.006 --> 02:37:31.047]  Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
[02:37:44.545 --> 02:37:47.186]  The problem is, is the government doesn't do what the people want.
[02:37:47.206 --> 02:37:48.526]  It doesn't do what's constitutional.
[02:37:48.546 --> 02:37:50.107]  It doesn't do what's righteous or decent.
[02:37:50.507 --> 02:37:56.328]  We just have to expose them and try to remove them from office, but they're racing ahead to put in the electronic fraud-driven systems.
[02:37:56.828 --> 02:37:59.989]  The White House was just caught publicly engaged in election fraud in 2002.
[02:38:00.689 --> 02:38:03.550]  In 2004, the Democrats were bought off even if we were to get them into office.
[02:38:04.130 --> 02:38:06.511]  We've got a tough road to hoe, but the good news is, is that
[02:38:07.742 --> 02:38:11.424]  Is that people are waking up and we're making hay while the sun shines.
[02:38:11.444 --> 02:38:12.104]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:12.905 --> 02:38:14.145]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[02:38:14.165 --> 02:38:15.066]  See if he's there this time.
[02:38:15.106 --> 02:38:15.686]  Go ahead, John.
[02:38:18.247 --> 02:38:18.888]  He did it again.
[02:38:19.148 --> 02:38:21.929]  Sometimes those callers call and they hang up and they get back on.
[02:38:21.949 --> 02:38:23.130]  They want to talk and they hang up again.
[02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:24.291]  I had this feeling he wouldn't be there.
[02:38:25.311 --> 02:38:26.292]  Mick in Arizona.
[02:38:26.372 --> 02:38:27.012]  Mick, welcome.
[02:38:27.552 --> 02:38:28.853]  Hey Alex, great job.
[02:38:28.913 --> 02:38:29.573]  Great interview.
[02:38:29.793 --> 02:38:30.174]  Thank you.
[02:38:30.354 --> 02:38:32.675]  Hey, your videos are popping up everywhere.
[02:38:33.174 --> 02:38:34.075]  Popping up everywhere.
[02:38:34.275 --> 02:38:37.278]  I'd like to encourage people to keep making copies and keep passing them out.
[02:38:37.418 --> 02:38:39.740]  What did you witness that makes you say that?
[02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:41.381]  Oh, I found them everywhere.
[02:38:41.401 --> 02:38:43.063]  There was a street fair in Tucson.
[02:38:43.183 --> 02:38:44.364]  People were passing them out there.
[02:38:46.323 --> 02:38:47.724]  What films are they passing out?
[02:38:47.744 --> 02:38:49.126]  A bunch of them.
[02:38:49.246 --> 02:38:54.730]  I couldn't tell you all of them, but I have to say there's at least hundreds of them that I know that were passed out.
[02:38:54.971 --> 02:38:55.211]  Good.
[02:38:55.231 --> 02:38:58.614]  Oh, but it's Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[02:38:58.634 --> 02:38:59.475]  That's really exciting.
[02:39:00.015 --> 02:39:06.260]  Hey, another twist to that terrorism, the false flag terrorism, is what I believe the police are doing in America today.
[02:39:07.201 --> 02:39:11.145]  Did you hear in Arizona they passed a law where they would make the illegals
[02:39:12.103 --> 02:39:12.904]  I don't know.
[02:39:32.097 --> 02:39:36.582]  They're more prone to commit other crimes because they don't give a hoot about our laws in the beginning.
[02:39:37.143 --> 02:39:45.231]  By the way, there are national and local studies that conclusively show that a disproportionate amount of crime is committed by the illegal aliens.
[02:39:45.492 --> 02:39:46.132]  That's a fact.
[02:39:46.433 --> 02:39:47.333]  That is a fact.
[02:39:47.474 --> 02:39:50.497]  And they know if they were to round them up, the crime rate would drop.
[02:39:51.124 --> 02:39:54.745]  And they wouldn't be able to fear-monger, and they wouldn't need all the police that they have.
[02:39:54.765 --> 02:39:56.886]  They could drop, cut them out of police and have them.
[02:39:56.906 --> 02:40:01.508]  Well, the Detroit police chief slipped up many decades ago and said the police aren't here to have order.
[02:40:01.888 --> 02:40:03.569]  The police are here to create disorder.
[02:40:04.258 --> 02:40:08.319]  And I'm not saying the average cop is doing that, but there's a reason, and I've looked at studies on this.
[02:40:09.039 --> 02:40:12.800]  Violent offenders spend less time in jail than non-violent offenders.
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:19.562]  Because a non-violent offender is easier to house, he'll work in the prison industry, he'll make money for the private corporation that owns it.
[02:40:19.902 --> 02:40:24.423]  A violent one is expensive to house, and if you release them, they will generate more crime.
[02:40:24.443 --> 02:40:30.004]  So they don't want to actually see the crime rate go down, because it justifies their bloated budgets.
[02:40:30.444 --> 02:40:31.005]  I agree with you.
[02:40:31.285 --> 02:40:32.525]  Thanks for the... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:33.868 --> 02:40:35.969]  I thought he was going to finish up and I interrupted him and he hung up.
[02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:37.970]  Thank you Mick, thank you for that good news.
[02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:44.053]  Everything is problem reaction solution or frame ups or false flag, whatever name you want to use.
[02:40:44.133 --> 02:40:47.574]  Blaming somebody for something you or one of your surrogates or minions did.
[02:40:48.815 --> 02:40:52.877]  The government controls the major narcotics conduits into this country.
[02:40:54.518 --> 02:40:57.639]  They know that nine out of ten home invasions
[02:40:58.713 --> 02:41:07.957]  8 out of 10 car jackings are robberies, but the number is 8 to 9 out of every 10, depending on which region or which area or which type of crime.
[02:41:08.717 --> 02:41:13.259]  But it's in the 80s and 90s, depending on which strata or sector of crime you look at.
[02:41:13.299 --> 02:41:15.179]  And cops driving are nodding their heads, they know this.
[02:41:15.419 --> 02:41:16.360]  This is the official numbers.
[02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:17.620]  So listen, officers.
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:20.801]  You're out there putting a tough job, dangerous position, for what?
[02:41:21.302 --> 02:41:22.322]  It's a load of baloney.
[02:41:23.562 --> 02:41:24.763]  The narcotics are shipped in.
[02:41:25.823 --> 02:41:33.529]  Then the crackheads, the heroin heads, the pill poppers, break in an average of two houses per day.
[02:41:35.230 --> 02:41:36.431]  That's what these junkies do.
[02:41:37.812 --> 02:41:53.885]  They break into the homes looking for stereos, computers, jewelry, to then go sell to these god-awful pawn shops that are everywhere, make me sick, and they go in there and they sell it, and then they go out and they buy drugs, a large portion of it, going directly into the banks to be laundered.
[02:41:55.465 --> 02:41:58.806]  Then, we've looked at the big cartels and the banks that launder the money.
[02:41:59.187 --> 02:42:09.471]  They predominantly own the thousands of private prisons in the country, with over 2.5 million people in private prisons, 7 million plus total in the system itself.
[02:42:09.871 --> 02:42:15.753]  They end up competing, lowering the wages of the average American worker because they work for an average of 20 cents an hour.
[02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:19.151]  Now, that ain't problem, reaction, solution.
[02:42:19.171 --> 02:42:19.952]  I don't know what is.
[02:42:20.352 --> 02:42:26.896]  Create a crisis, offer the solution, and then get your original aim through via that system.
[02:42:28.758 --> 02:42:30.739]  And so, the drug war is a great success.
[02:42:30.899 --> 02:42:36.863]  If you look at it from their stated goal of getting drugs off the street, making our children healthy and happy, it's a total failure.
[02:42:36.883 --> 02:42:44.348]  But if you look at the reality of it, more people in prison, more drugs than ever on the streets, more crime, more cops, more control.
[02:42:46.522 --> 02:42:51.363]  They don't want the old-fashioned cop where somebody committed a crime, it was a big deal, they were going to catch you, did it?
[02:42:51.983 --> 02:42:52.943]  You look at the old numbers.
[02:42:53.224 --> 02:43:00.205]  Did you know when you kill a cop, nine times out of ten, they catch the person and convict them?
[02:43:01.045 --> 02:43:08.147]  Did you know that when an American, an average citizen, a civilian as they call us in military terminology, gets killed, it's the reverse?
[02:43:09.289 --> 02:43:10.209]  Or almost the reverse.
[02:43:10.709 --> 02:43:12.150]  Two times out of ten.
[02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:17.011]  Twenty percent of the time, they catch them, convict them, catch them, indict them, convict them, and prison them.
[02:43:18.132 --> 02:43:20.673]  See, if they want to really catch somebody, they can do it.
[02:43:21.593 --> 02:43:22.353]  And they do do it.
[02:43:23.333 --> 02:43:28.995]  Now, if you look at the old statistics, it was over seventy percent of the time, a violent crime, you got caught.
[02:43:29.275 --> 02:43:30.316]  They would hunt you down.
[02:43:30.356 --> 02:43:31.576]  They would go to the ends of the earth.
[02:43:31.836 --> 02:43:33.377]  That's what police did.
[02:43:36.057 --> 02:43:37.718]  If it was a minor petty crime,
[02:43:39.594 --> 02:43:41.355]  Here's an example of what old-time cops would do.
[02:43:41.575 --> 02:43:42.556]  And this is historical.
[02:43:42.576 --> 02:43:43.537]  They'd catch a bully.
[02:43:43.918 --> 02:43:47.161]  They'd catch 3 or 4 16-year-olds beating a 10-year-old up in an alley.
[02:43:49.183 --> 02:43:50.184]  The kids wouldn't get arrested.
[02:43:50.204 --> 02:43:52.846]  The cops would beat them up.
[02:43:52.866 --> 02:43:54.067]  That was the old days.
[02:43:54.468 --> 02:43:55.509]  Oh, you want to be a bully?
[02:43:55.869 --> 02:43:57.030]  Here, we're just going to beat you up.
[02:43:57.230 --> 02:43:58.591]  Because they didn't want to get you in the system.
[02:43:58.611 --> 02:43:59.672]  They wanted to teach you a lesson.
[02:44:00.173 --> 02:44:01.434]  The jails were very small.
[02:44:01.474 --> 02:44:04.397]  They were encouraged by the judges and others not to put a bunch of people in the system.
[02:44:06.352 --> 02:44:10.093]  If old Billy Bob was out drunk, they would just put Billy Bob in the slammer.
[02:44:10.113 --> 02:44:12.434]  If he was falling down drunk, starting fights, they wouldn't charge him.
[02:44:12.454 --> 02:44:14.154]  They'd throw him in the slammer until he cooled off.
[02:44:14.715 --> 02:44:15.735]  The next day, they'd let him go.
[02:44:18.016 --> 02:44:23.797]  But if you beat somebody up and robbed them, they're going to hunt you down and you're going to spend 20 years hard labor.
[02:44:24.378 --> 02:44:29.499]  If you murdered somebody, 7 plus times out of 10, they're going to hunt you down.
[02:44:29.799 --> 02:44:32.300]  That Texas Ranger is going to follow you to California.
[02:44:34.261 --> 02:44:36.762]  And when you committed a crime, you thought about it twice.
[02:44:38.042 --> 02:44:38.402]  Okay?
[02:44:38.662 --> 02:44:39.703]  That isn't the way it is now.
[02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:41.463]  I've had cars stolen twice.
[02:44:41.563 --> 02:44:42.804]  Once in Dallas, once in Austin.
[02:44:43.304 --> 02:44:43.624]  Nothing.
[02:44:44.304 --> 02:44:46.585]  I got mad, slightly rude to the cops in Dallas.
[02:44:46.625 --> 02:44:48.165]  I just said, fine, you're not going to help me, sure.
[02:44:48.726 --> 02:44:50.606]  And I hung up after like 30 minutes on the phone.
[02:44:51.206 --> 02:44:54.827]  Oh, the police came real mad and said, you didn't have permission to hang up.
[02:44:55.968 --> 02:44:57.508]  Now we want to search this apartment.
[02:44:57.528 --> 02:44:58.469]  I'm in there with my girlfriend.
[02:45:01.149 --> 02:45:02.490]  That's America, folks.
[02:45:03.363 --> 02:45:11.652]  And then I saw an article where in Dallas they were just going to quit even trying to go out and catch people who had committed car robberies.
[02:45:11.712 --> 02:45:12.233]  And what happens?
[02:45:12.713 --> 02:45:13.995]  Grand theft auto increases.
[02:45:15.576 --> 02:45:18.760]  It's the same thing over and over.
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.802]  Now believe me, police would rather.
[02:45:20.822 --> 02:45:25.127]  I mean in the old days you didn't have just normal cops just everywhere minding everything.
[02:45:26.098 --> 02:45:27.959]  What you had was detectives.
[02:45:28.459 --> 02:45:31.041]  You had them out actually trying to do something.
[02:45:31.461 --> 02:45:37.325]  Just 50 years ago, a cop in blue, he'd help if the car broke down or he'd help if there was something going on or a fight.
[02:45:37.705 --> 02:45:44.509]  But a lot of the time, he was there aiding detectives and they were going around collecting data and watching people and seeing what's going on and they didn't put up with it.
[02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:45.909]  Now we have the opposite.
[02:45:45.930 --> 02:45:53.014]  You know, they say crimes drop, but really, when the advent of television and all the violent acts on it desensitized this, it clearly showed increased crime.
[02:45:53.314 --> 02:45:55.235]  That's only one small part of the equation.
[02:45:56.573 --> 02:46:02.077]  A lot of it's societal and the changing crime-fighting tactics, but the best way to see the graph is a mountain.
[02:46:03.458 --> 02:46:03.839]  Okay?
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:10.404]  And so in about 1991, crime hits an all-time high.
[02:46:11.124 --> 02:46:15.188]  Then we go a few hundred feet down the mountain, but it's a 12,000 foot mountain.
[02:46:15.648 --> 02:46:20.972]  So we went up to the peak in the early 90s, and now we're a few hundred feet down the side, but we're still up on the top of the mountain.
[02:46:21.613 --> 02:46:22.854]  We're just a few hundred feet to the summit.
[02:46:23.134 --> 02:46:25.636]  So it went up to an all-time high, it's gone down a little bit,
[02:46:26.252 --> 02:46:30.753]  But compared to 1955, we're still up on top of a mountain of crime.
[02:46:33.874 --> 02:46:35.715]  And what has made crime actually drop a little bit?
[02:46:36.695 --> 02:46:39.295]  What, over 25 states have passed concealed carry laws?
[02:46:39.756 --> 02:46:43.717]  And you see on average around 24% Florida, Texas is in between those numbers.
[02:46:44.097 --> 02:46:45.957]  Other states, within two years, crime plummets.
[02:46:46.257 --> 02:46:47.838]  Because let me tell you something, the crooks know.
[02:46:48.278 --> 02:46:51.299]  Why is New York, why don't all the crooks move to New York, Chicago, LA?
[02:46:51.319 --> 02:46:52.459]  Because you've got all the gun control.
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:53.780]  Detroit.
[02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:58.343]  They know they can enjoy themselves, but in Texas they bust through a door.
[02:46:58.603 --> 02:47:09.628]  They know over half the time there's going to be a .357 Magnum or a Defender Winchester pump shotgun, 12 gauge.
[02:47:10.149 --> 02:47:13.290]  You come in my house and you try to hurt my family, I'm going to kill you.
[02:47:14.351 --> 02:47:15.611]  And so that's why you don't come around.
[02:47:15.631 --> 02:47:17.052]  That's why my family is a lot safer.
[02:47:18.753 --> 02:47:20.154]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to
[02:47:22.315 --> 02:47:23.736]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob and Mash.
[02:47:23.816 --> 02:47:24.436]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:47:52.859 --> 02:47:54.921]  a target of any kind of bombing or whatnot.
[02:47:55.102 --> 02:47:56.143]  And now they're getting blown up?
[02:47:56.583 --> 02:47:56.864]  Yeah.
[02:47:56.984 --> 02:47:58.025]  I know he did bring that up.
[02:47:58.225 --> 02:48:01.169]  He brought up that the SAS caught dressed up like Arabs.
[02:48:01.209 --> 02:48:01.549]  Yeah, I know.
[02:48:01.569 --> 02:48:02.110]  He brought that up.
[02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.931]  Okay.
[02:48:03.812 --> 02:48:05.033]  Well, anyway, I just wanted to mention it.
[02:48:06.475 --> 02:48:07.396]  Bob, I appreciate you.
[02:48:07.416 --> 02:48:08.497]  Are you on an IP phone?
[02:48:09.435 --> 02:48:10.657]  No, it's a really weird line.

[02:48:57.425 --> 02:49:04.172]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.472 --> 02:49:06.453]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.653 --> 02:49:09.515]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.595 --> 02:49:14.258]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.478 --> 02:49:18.860]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:26.344]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:51:52.811 --> 02:51:55.172]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:56.713 --> 02:51:58.954]  There certainly is and knowing is half the battle.
[02:52:00.675 --> 02:52:02.436]  Nora and Bruce is all I have time to take.
[02:52:02.476 --> 02:52:05.377]  I'm sorry to Elias and Raimondo and so many people.
[02:52:05.417 --> 02:52:06.858]  Just call me back on Monday.
[02:52:06.878 --> 02:52:09.820]  We're going to take a few calls though here in a second.
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.121]  Texas stops arresting drunks in bars.
[02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:16.132]  Operation Last Call program suspended after public outcry.
[02:52:16.893 --> 02:52:25.479]  Austin, Texas did this three years ago, so did DC, and we talked about it then and they stopped it for two years, two and a half years, and then brought it back.
[02:52:26.179 --> 02:52:30.182]  And World Net Daily, of course, as usual, takes credit for stopping it, not the national outcry.
[02:52:30.682 --> 02:52:41.430]  After a series of stories on World Net Daily about cops going into bars to arrest drunks, some of whom are guests in hotels who don't plan to drive anywhere, Texas officials responsible for Operation Last Call have stopped the controversial practice in Texas.
[02:52:42.834 --> 02:52:47.597]  Talks about the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission along with Irving Police arrested some 30 people.
[02:52:48.177 --> 02:52:49.658]  They do it in Austin, by the way, mainly.
[02:52:50.139 --> 02:52:50.879]  And it just goes in.
[02:52:51.219 --> 02:52:55.602]  Folks, I have personal friends who hardly drink.
[02:52:55.642 --> 02:52:57.083]  I mean, maybe a beer or two.
[02:52:57.443 --> 02:52:58.444]  In years, I've known them.
[02:52:58.884 --> 02:53:00.585]  Who have been in sports bars.
[02:53:00.745 --> 02:53:02.326]  I mean, everywhere is a bar in Austin.
[02:53:02.647 --> 02:53:04.468]  Most restaurants, almost all of them serve alcohol.
[02:53:04.828 --> 02:53:09.051]  And you'll be there to play pool or play foosball or video games with your family.
[02:53:09.071 --> 02:53:10.231]  We have like Dave and Buster's here.
[02:53:10.271 --> 02:53:10.892]  They serve alcohol.
[02:53:12.216 --> 02:53:19.637]  And here will come, you know, the Texas Alcohol Commission, they will come in and just have a paddy wagon and just arrest everyone!
[02:53:20.358 --> 02:53:21.438]  That's been in the news!
[02:53:22.418 --> 02:53:24.918]  And yeah, they got in a lot of trouble because they'd go into hotel bars.
[02:53:25.979 --> 02:53:30.079]  There'd be a guy they see drink three drinks, they consider that drunk, and man, they take you to jail!
[02:53:30.199 --> 02:53:39.061]  I mean, it's just, it's like last week, the police arrest people, don't even charge them, and they're taking them to the dentist to have their gold teeth ripped out, going, well, that's acid pulmonary seizure!
[02:53:40.013 --> 02:53:45.755]  The story is, not that they're ripping teeth out or trying to, it's that they think you're guilty until proven innocence.
[02:53:45.855 --> 02:53:47.015]  It's totally un-American.
[02:53:47.716 --> 02:53:49.976]  So some good news though, they're claiming they're going to stop that.
[02:53:49.996 --> 02:53:52.537]  I don't believe it for a minute, but at least they're having the backpedal.
[02:53:53.597 --> 02:53:57.399]  Also, I really hope all of you will go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a monthly membership, $5.95.

[02:54:40.849 --> 02:54:44.611]  And it's so important to get my films and make copies of them.
[02:54:44.651 --> 02:54:45.792]  That's where it's having the effect.
[02:54:45.832 --> 02:54:48.413]  If you've got my films, make copies, get them out to people.
[02:54:48.633 --> 02:54:50.294]  If you haven't gotten them, get them, make copies.
[02:54:50.354 --> 02:54:52.055]  It's having such a huge effect.
[02:54:52.835 --> 02:54:54.576]  Nora in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:54:54.596 --> 02:54:56.056]  Hi Alex, love your show.
[02:54:56.236 --> 02:54:56.616]  Thank you.
[02:54:56.677 --> 02:54:57.857]  Great guest.
[02:54:57.957 --> 02:55:00.518]  I just want a quick comment and a question.
[02:55:01.938 --> 02:55:06.780]  This guy that keeps calling that's obsessed with Charlie Sheen being at the Illuminati meeting.
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:10.421]  Does that mean that Joan Vian is a globalist because she's at all the meetings?
[02:55:11.162 --> 02:55:12.882]  Well, we looked it up and made phone calls.
[02:55:12.922 --> 02:55:13.362]  It's not true.
[02:55:16.024 --> 02:55:20.906]  You know, I've learned so much from you, and I'd like to learn more about Zionism and Zionists.
[02:55:20.986 --> 02:55:22.186]  I'm really confused with that.
[02:55:22.206 --> 02:55:26.628]  Do you have something on the web or a book you can recommend where I can educate myself?
[02:55:26.648 --> 02:55:35.751]  Well, certainly the labor Zionists, there's three different groups of Zionists, but two of the three groups are definitely bad, and we have done shows in the past.
[02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:36.111]  You should go
[02:55:36.983 --> 02:55:45.488]  PrisonPlanet.tv, there's a two hour interview I did with, well the ads cut out an hour and a half, with Robert Galen Ross, and he really breaks it down there.
[02:55:46.028 --> 02:55:53.473]  And we also have Ted Pike, two of his videos he authorizes to post at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can watch those there, or contact him and get a hard copy.
[02:55:53.953 --> 02:55:58.916]  And we have done probably about ten shows so far this year on that subject, and we do cover it.
[02:56:00.207 --> 02:56:04.491]  We just talked about earlier this hour about Israel carrying out terror attacks to blame it on their enemies.
[02:56:04.691 --> 02:56:06.212]  So, alright, we're out of time.
[02:56:06.392 --> 02:56:13.598]  But again, Zionists represent a very small number of Jews and a lot of people that just hate Jews use it as an excuse to hate them.
[02:56:14.239 --> 02:56:15.220]  We love the Jews.
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:16.240]  We love everybody here.
[02:56:16.641 --> 02:56:17.141]  We love you.
[02:56:18.022 --> 02:56:19.143]  We love the Mexicans.
[02:56:19.183 --> 02:56:19.903]  We love the blacks.
[02:56:19.923 --> 02:56:20.604]  We love the whites.
[02:56:20.624 --> 02:56:21.305]  We love everybody.
[02:56:21.885 --> 02:56:22.826]  God bless you all!
