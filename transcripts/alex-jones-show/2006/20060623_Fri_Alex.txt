[00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.127]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:07.848]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.111]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:17.116]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:21.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:29.066]  Live from the Infowar Studios, deep behind enemy lines, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.058]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:35.523]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:39.609]  It is the 23rd day of June, 2006, of Friday.
[00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.911]  A good Friday!
[00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.633]  It is a good day to die!
[00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:45.934]  Welcome aboard.
[00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:47.655]  We've got a great show for you today.
[00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:55.543]  Dar Jamal will be joining us in the second hour of our broadcast today, giving us some updates of what is going on deep inside Iraq.
[00:00:55.583 --> 00:01:03.831]  Dar Jamal has some great contacts as a former unembedded reporter in Iraq, and he's going to come up in the second hour of today's program and give us the skinny.
[00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:08.736]  We're going to be taking a lot of calls today as well and talking about a lot of news.
[00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:16.540]  Alex Jones will also be joining us here in about 10 minutes to discuss with me, and you, the Summer of Fear.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.021]  That's right folks, one day after the next.
[00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:24.644]  One terrorist plot foiled every single day leading up to the midterm elections.
[00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:27.785]  And many boogeymen killed and caught.
[00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:32.007]  The Democrats, of course, the Liberals, cutting and running.
[00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:34.709]  And Jim Fetzer, last night,
[00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:47.950]  On the Hannity, or Vanity and Combs program, Oliver North sitting in for Sean Vanity just destroyed both Oliver North and, well, I think Alan Combs was along for the ride.
[00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.993]  Sometimes you just get the feeling that Combs really wants to just break out and tell us what we want to know, but then again, let's not give him too much credit.
[00:01:56.393 --> 00:01:57.794]  Got a lot of news to cover today, though.
[00:01:58.174 --> 00:01:58.414]  U.S.
[00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:00.815]  military links the Karzai brothers
[00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:06.898]  Of course, you know, Hamid Karzai is the Chief Governor of Kabul in Afghanistan.
[00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:09.039]  They are linking them now to drugs!
[00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:09.720]  That's right!
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.604]  This is exactly what we've been talking about on my program and this program for the last week is how all of this always seems to connect to drugs.
[00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:23.327]  How drugs and the global drug smuggling rings headed by global intelligence of the New World Order
[00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:25.188]  Fund terrorism.
[00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.409]  They go hand in hand.
[00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.350]  We're also going to talk about more terrorist plots foiled in the summer of fear.
[00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.411]  One particularly going on in the UK.
[00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.611]  They busted one in the UK.
[00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:36.772]  They busted one in Canada.
[00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:39.412]  They busted one just about a month ago in Australia.
[00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:42.093]  And now we've got another one here in Florida.
[00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:45.474]  Of course, Alex Jones will be joining us here in just a few minutes to discuss that with you.
[00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:50.595]  Tom Ridge has come out and said the War on Terror will last decades.
[00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:56.316]  That wouldn't be anything new, as we've been told this from the beginning, that this war will last generations.
[00:02:56.396 --> 00:03:01.358]  In fact, some have put a time span of a 100-year War on Terror.
[00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:10.420]  I suppose at that time, when we've run out of boogeymen, we'll have to invent little green men from space coming down to be our mortal enemy.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.300]  This will be the final act
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:23.127]  If it hasn't happened already, that we'll have the world join together and form that glorious, peaceful, one-world government in order to fight the evil attackers.
[00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.269]  But that'll be a hundred years from now.
[00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.672]  Newspapers have rejected the White House request to kill Astori.
[00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:33.314]  More propaganda, more psychological warfare on the people.
[00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:34.515]  We'll talk about that today.
[00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:36.778]  Also, a new report coming out.
[00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:40.021]  Social isolation is growing in the United States.
[00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:44.907]  A new study says the number of people who say they have no one to confide in has risen.
[00:03:45.228 --> 00:03:46.650]  Of course, that's right folks.
[00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.572]  We don't talk to our neighbors anymore.
[00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:50.675]  We don't talk to our family anymore.
[00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:54.558]  I don't think that's true for you info warriors out there.
[00:03:54.578 --> 00:04:13.672]  In fact, you're doing all the talking, which is fantastic, but the average American out there, constantly isolated, constantly locked into their own little world, their virtual world of 500 channels of programming, of internet surfing, of Walmart to trinkets from
[00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:23.275]  China, this is the world that we have created for ourselves, and I'll say it before, I've said it before, I'll say it again, we get what we pay for.
[00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.596]  We're going to talk about that a little bit today.
[00:04:25.616 --> 00:04:33.179]  Ah, yes, and if you don't think that's enough, in China, a woman forced to abort a fetus at seven months.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.540]  That's our future, folks.
[00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:43.969]  Eugenics, population control, and yes, let's get rid of 95% of the population.
[00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:44.909]  Not me that's saying that.
[00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:46.530]  Of course, that is the elite.
[00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.370]  We'll come right back.
[00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.971]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:50.711]  I'm Jack Blood filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:52.852]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:53.272]  Stay tuned.
[00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:02.735]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:05.996]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:10.017]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:14.318]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:18.419]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:20.420]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.901]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:25.001]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.642]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:31.823]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:34.864]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:41.466]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:45.809]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:19.348]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.733]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.433]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.493 --> 00:06:41.395]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:47.520]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:05.710]  Look no further!

[00:07:19.514 --> 00:07:20.054]  I think so.
[00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.120]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.874]  Ease the T-Rex in political talk.
[00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:07.259]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:13.648]  I am the pterodactyl of talk radio.
[00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:20.911]  We have the T-Rex with us, live from Los Angeles, checking in with us, one and only Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:22.712]  Alex, good to have you aboard.
[00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:25.493]  Man, the summer of fear really taking effect here.
[00:08:25.513 --> 00:08:32.477]  Wanted to have you come on and talk about these seven black Muslims rounded up in this domestic terror plot in Florida.
[00:08:33.664 --> 00:08:35.606]  Well, Jack, thanks for having me on and thanks for sitting in.
[00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:36.807]  I know you're flying out here tonight.
[00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:40.149]  Well, I tell you, the conference, first off, sold out on Monday.
[00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:46.014]  And there are hordes of people showing up here going, we've got to get tickets, we've got to get tickets.
[00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:48.196]  It's just wild how big this has gotten.
[00:08:48.216 --> 00:08:50.657]  We probably could have had 3,000 or 4,000 people here, not 1,200.
[00:08:51.738 --> 00:08:54.160]  And as reported yesterday, C-SPAN is going to be here.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.002]  It looks like BBC is going to be here, CNN.
[00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:59.442]  Charlie Sheen is going to be speaking some tomorrow.
[00:08:59.462 --> 00:09:01.543]  We're going to have some other surprise guests.
[00:09:01.764 --> 00:09:03.665]  So it's going to be amazing.
[00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:15.010]  And obviously, part of my talk that I'm going to give tomorrow is going to be, and was going to be, on provocateuring terrorist attacks, or provocateuring the illusion of these.
[00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:25.776]  So before I get in briefly to what's happening right now, well, first off, I went to bed last night about 1 o'clock California time, about 3 o'clock Central time,
[00:09:26.374 --> 00:09:34.041]  I was on a nationally syndicated Spanish radio show for two hours laying out how 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.364]  So that's my excuse for just waking up about an hour and a half ago.
[00:09:37.904 --> 00:09:45.731]  And I opened my eyes, I turned the television on, it's on CNN, and they're saying, coming up, the terror bust in Florida!
[00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:50.295]  So, immediately I said, okay, it's going to be either
[00:09:51.082 --> 00:09:59.925]  Registered welfare recipients, Muslim men who are registered to be retarded, or it's going to be teenagers.
[00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:01.946]  And again, it's not that I'm some genius, folks.
[00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:04.547]  I've seen this over and over again from Canada to England.
[00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:05.737]  To the U.S.
[00:10:05.757 --> 00:10:07.638]  going back to the 1993 World Trade Center attack.
[00:10:07.658 --> 00:10:11.559]  And domestic terror, which seems to be the angle in all the recent roundups around the world.
[00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:19.561]  And it just so happens that a month ago, why, Mueller, the head of the FBI, had a speech just scheduled for today on the danger of domestic terror.
[00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:23.802]  So, exactly what I thought the report would be, it then comes on,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.361]  And they admit that these were young, dumb kids.
[00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:35.444]  They show one of their friends an incoherent gibbering about how we just love the Bible and we love Jesus and all of this stuff.
[00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:41.026]  And they imagine, out of the clear blue sky, the feds show up.
[00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:50.209]  With $50,000, hand it to kids, tell them they're soldiers at first, then tell them you get $50,000 more if you go videotape this.
[00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:54.931]  The kids freak out, they think they've entered, you know, heaven or something, nirvana.
[00:10:55.512 --> 00:11:01.114]  They start running around, they go videotape what they're told to videotape, and boom, it's this huge national rave.
[00:11:01.134 --> 00:11:08.477]  But even CNN and Fox were having to admit, well, the government basically went out, funded the group, set it up, got the space,
[00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:10.497]  Videotape them saying all this.
[00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.719]  So now, before I go further, Jack, let me just back up.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.484]  Back in, what was it, 1994, they had the Viper Militia.
[00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:23.166]  And that was out on the West Coast.
[00:11:24.047 --> 00:11:25.468]  And this is all on the record.
[00:11:25.508 --> 00:11:32.053]  The FBI went out, went to a methamphetamine dealing bar owned by bikers.
[00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:37.977]  Over the next year, the FBI agent became the head of the group
[00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:42.355]  With two informants he had also infiltrated the group because he kept giving them so much money.
[00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:42.956]  They said, sure.
[00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:45.577]  It was a very small bike club, drug dealers.
[00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:48.039]  And they said, we're the Viper Militia.
[00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:49.239]  He gave them machine guns.
[00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.860]  They detonated some bottle bombs.
[00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:52.241]  Then they raided them.
[00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:56.283]  And of course, the FBI chose the name because it was the Viper Biker Club.
[00:11:56.584 --> 00:11:59.205]  They knew that that would sound great later to say Viper Militia.
[00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:05.469]  Now, Bumsteer Award, 1998, Mid-Texas, Texas Monthly, big insult.
[00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:07.610]  It's in my film, Police Take Through the Takeover.
[00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:15.769]  They go out and literally, an FBI informant with an FBI agent, and this is why they got really scared in the media, but back then they got in trouble for this.
[00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:16.550]  Now it's a good thing.
[00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.431]  And they went to, and nothing against trailer parks, folks.
[00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:22.872]  You aren't trashed if you live in a trailer, but trash does sometimes live in trailers.
[00:12:23.412 --> 00:12:29.254]  But they went to this trailer trash people, and they literally spent two years
[00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:33.712]  They went to these two men who had two wives.
[00:12:33.992 --> 00:12:35.852]  They, quote, created a Klan group.
[00:12:36.332 --> 00:12:37.672]  The informant was the leader.
[00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:41.893]  He gave them tens of thousands of dollars, tried to get them to attack the chemical plant.
[00:12:42.313 --> 00:12:46.434]  Again, gave them a video camera, they videotaped blowing up a black powder bottle bomb.
[00:12:46.914 --> 00:12:51.235]  They got them talking about how they were going to take over the White House and how they were going to become president after they robbed it.
[00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:58.296]  It was so delusional that the FBI could never get them to actually attack the chemical plant there in Arlington, right by Fort Worth.
[00:12:58.737 --> 00:12:59.738]  Well, I, by the way, have family.
[00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:01.019]  I don't appreciate that, FBI.
[00:13:01.359 --> 00:13:07.023]  And so they raided them and busted them, but then it came out that it was all staged, and the guy that they had doing this had done it over and over again.
[00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:13.227]  So, then remember, about four months ago, in Ohio, they raided and busted a bunch of people.
[00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:14.728]  They were planning all these terror attacks.
[00:13:14.768 --> 00:13:21.673]  Turns out the, quote, leader was a Army Special Forces officer who'd, quote, been sheep-dipped, just come out of the military.
[00:13:21.993 --> 00:13:22.974]  He went out and found
[00:13:23.827 --> 00:13:33.092]  Some young people, ages about 18 to 25, and got them just to shoot their mouths off at meetings and say, yeah, yeah, and to agree with him.
[00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:50.949]  Then we look at about a month ago in England, the same day they announced they'd bust 17 people in Canada, they raid a house with over 50 armed police, that one house, over 400 in the neighborhood, they go in a house, they shoot an innocent person, turns out, oh, it was just a false alarm, but tight retractions, back of the paper, no terrorist busted.
[00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:55.913]  Canada, it's the same thing, they provocateur'd them, they got them, found people to just shoot their mouths off.
[00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:59.996]  Jack, I experienced this in Canada,
[00:14:00.811 --> 00:14:08.536]  With upwards of four different provocateurs at once, openly saying, we need to blow stuff up, we need to do this and that, then later on... We hear this in our forum all the time, Alex.
[00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:10.318]  I mean, this is just the routine for us now.
[00:14:10.338 --> 00:14:11.038]  Mm-hmm.
[00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:22.166]  So if they can get you to one time, and I put this in the article, Paul Watson did, if you one time agree with them, you will then be arrested,
[00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:27.145]  And listen, I would have been on Canadian television, Alex Jones, plotting terror attack.
[00:14:27.526 --> 00:14:29.626]  When I came in, they were asking me if I was.
[00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:31.747]  You see, they had this whole thing set up.
[00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:38.829]  Then they grabbed people and derogated them, who weren't provocateuring, and took them to weird facilities and said, you know, are you with Alex Jones?
[00:14:38.869 --> 00:14:42.690]  Are you planning on... I mean, folks, this is what they do.
[00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.851]  Now, let's go back to 93.
[00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:47.712]  On the record, the FBI took the bomb, trained the driver, gave them the detonators,
[00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:52.889]  Both of the Muslim men were on city welfare, registered mentally retarded.
[00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.092]  So this is how they operate.
[00:14:56.513 --> 00:14:57.574]  This is what they do.
[00:14:57.654 --> 00:14:58.815]  And frankly, I'm sick of it.
[00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.579]  And we were talking before the show started.
[00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:01.959]  You're right.
[00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:03.160]  It is the summer of terror.
[00:15:03.581 --> 00:15:05.343]  We asked, what are they going to do to be able to attack Iran?
[00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.644]  What are they going to do for the election?
[00:15:06.944 --> 00:15:07.425]  And you're right.
[00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:09.868]  They staged the announcement of Roe for now.
[00:15:10.777 --> 00:15:13.100]  They're staging all these quote high-profile busts.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.802]  Oh, they're going to save you.
[00:15:14.842 --> 00:15:19.567]  And then I saw them on CNN going, good thing Chicago just put in all those Homeland Security cameras.
[00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:20.889]  This will keep people safe.
[00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:22.310]  The cameras will keep you safe.
[00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:29.098]  And then literally we see the real potential terrorists, all these men in camouflage, unnamed, and wearing masks.
[00:15:29.518 --> 00:15:30.899]  Running around our streets, folks.
[00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:32.899]  I'm sorry, but those men know it or not.
[00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.720]  They work for the people that carried out 9-11.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:42.823]  Right, and then we got the mayor of Cleveland coming out and saying that all the teens are terrorists, and again, this feeds into this cycle of fear with domestic terrorism.
[00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:43.163]  Exactly.
[00:15:43.203 --> 00:15:46.944]  Now, all crime or street fights are now terrorism.
[00:15:47.584 --> 00:15:48.285]  Everything is terror.
[00:15:48.305 --> 00:15:50.445]  But what is the Webster's definition of terror?
[00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.006]  It is using fear to control populations.
[00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:54.507]  It is terrorizing.
[00:15:54.627 --> 00:15:57.308]  The government is terrorizing us with the media,
[00:15:57.768 --> 00:15:58.609]  With these reports.
[00:15:58.689 --> 00:16:07.796]  It won't matter that in a week or a month, it'll come out that all this was staged and gets thrown out and that, you know, half of them are mentally retarded and the other half are mentally... We'll not hear any more about it.
[00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:09.898]  It'll be back in the paper.
[00:16:10.318 --> 00:16:15.783]  And then I'll, you know, be sitting there in the grocery store lying here and some people go, oh, the duckling's on me too, thank goodness!
[00:16:16.363 --> 00:16:22.488]  I mean, so, so bottom line, I want Paul Watson, I know he's listening, to write an article on this, but instead of just focusing on this new case,
[00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:27.649]  Maybe a rundown of... I mean, there are cases in the 60s and 70s.
[00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:29.910]  Nixon did this north of me in San Francisco.
[00:16:31.111 --> 00:16:34.552]  It's a famous case where they had this big peace group that was really getting effective.
[00:16:34.612 --> 00:16:35.693]  Hundreds of peaceful people.
[00:16:36.193 --> 00:16:40.035]  And so the FBI gave them, what was it, $20,000.
[00:16:40.535 --> 00:16:42.096]  So that person became the treasurer.
[00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:43.216]  The FBI agent became the treasurer.
[00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:43.877]  Oh, you've got money?
[00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:45.057]  Sure, you're the treasurer.
[00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:48.859]  Then he went out with two other members he could convince just to quote
[00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:50.543]  Have some fun.
[00:16:50.563 --> 00:16:59.789]  He lit a half stick of dynamite in a mudflat, and then they arrested hundreds of people, many of them are still in prison, who were totally innocent and had nothing to do with it.
[00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:05.293]  So, you know, we've got the BATF with militia members bearing pipe bombs on their land in Michigan.
[00:17:05.313 --> 00:17:07.094]  They've been caught doing that.
[00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:10.837]  And so let's just get, you know, flat out about this.
[00:17:11.937 --> 00:17:16.724]  The reason violence isn't good is because the government carries out violence and then blame it on their enemies.
[00:17:17.144 --> 00:17:23.073]  And if anybody ever buries something on my land or anybody ever buries something on Jack's land, we're on record that this is total baloney.
[00:17:23.093 --> 00:17:26.077]  But notice they don't mess with us because they know that we're on record.
[00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:32.441]  And I want criminal charges for these FBI agents that tried to set these kids up to do something violent.
[00:17:32.821 --> 00:17:34.942]  Because this is more than a sting, more than a setup.
[00:17:35.342 --> 00:17:39.104]  What if somebody is able to carry this out before they're able to stop them?
[00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:41.065]  They're going to be responsible, but that's exactly their plan.
[00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:44.327]  Well, yes, but it goes even two steps past entrapment.
[00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:45.468]  It goes two steps past that.
[00:18:12.992 --> 00:18:22.978]  We know with the Klan group in 98, we know with the 93 bombing in New York, that they're actually trying to get them to carry out the bombings.
[00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:30.662]  They only bust them when the people are so stupid and so dumb that they can't actually get them to carry it out.
[00:18:31.563 --> 00:18:42.169]  And so, on record, our government, New York Times, again, but Plainview, The Average Person Still Doesn't Know, it was on CBS News, ABC News, all of this is on the record.
[00:18:42.734 --> 00:18:50.276]  That the FBI took the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators, and then Amad Salam, the informant, the Egyptian Security Force agent, said, look, it's time to bust them.
[00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:52.356]  And they said, nope, we're letting it go forward.
[00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:58.478]  He knew he was being set up, so he recorded over 12 hours of him saying, we're going to let the bombing take place.
[00:18:59.698 --> 00:19:00.898]  And then they shut him up.
[00:19:00.938 --> 00:19:03.839]  They paid him $1.3 million to go away and shut up.
[00:19:04.968 --> 00:19:15.252]  So, listen folks, the government right now, if they can find some group, they will give them bombs, they will give them detonators, they will kill you and your family, and they will take your freedoms after they do it.
[00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:25.215]  I'm glad you put this warning out, because this pertains to a lot of the people that maybe might listen to a show like this, Alex, who are out chatting on a message board somewhere about how they might want to do something.
[00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:26.615]  You will be targeted!
[00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:31.757]  You will be targeted, you will be set up, and we'll read about you in the newspapers, the next new big
[00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:36.198]  The black lot foiled, isn't Homeland Security and the FBI doing a wonderful job?
[00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:36.818]  Exactly.
[00:19:36.838 --> 00:19:46.460]  This is a phony war, so they've got to continue to create this boogeyman threat, and they are literally, in front of everyone, setting up a basket of real and fake terrorists.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.160]  Are you going to stay through this break?
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.321]  I'm going to let you go, Jack.
[00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:52.661]  You're flying in tonight, I'll see you this evening, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:55.302]  It's going to be an incredible event, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:55.322 --> 00:20:01.043]  I want to thank those that are here and those that are coming, and just expose the fake government terrorism at FirstPlanet.com.
[00:20:02.169 --> 00:20:05.471]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[00:20:05.951 --> 00:20:08.112]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[00:20:08.633 --> 00:20:13.995]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[00:20:14.536 --> 00:20:20.399]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution, to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?
[00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.261]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.
[00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:26.383]  We focus on the whole you.
[00:20:26.843 --> 00:20:32.106]  Personalized for your unique body composition, individual needs, and personal goals.
[00:20:32.646 --> 00:20:34.828]  Not the cookie cutter approach offered by others.
[00:20:35.515 --> 00:20:35.995]  I think so.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.462]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:17.947]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:18.768]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.828 --> 00:21:24.410]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.011]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:29.933]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.973 --> 00:21:32.814]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.934 --> 00:21:38.956]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:39.376 --> 00:21:42.717]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.817 --> 00:21:49.140]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.721]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.841 --> 00:21:56.401]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:57.181]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.301 --> 00:22:03.923]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:22:04.263 --> 00:22:07.023]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:07.303 --> 00:22:11.444]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:11.884 --> 00:22:12.704]  So what do you do?
[00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:17.605]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:20.207]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:20.707 --> 00:22:35.395]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:35.435 --> 00:22:42.579]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:23:02.586 --> 00:23:08.968]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:23:09.328 --> 00:23:13.990]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency technology.
[00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:21.853]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[00:23:22.313 --> 00:23:29.200]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.801]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:34.765]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[00:23:49.698 --> 00:23:50.418]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:27.930]  Yes, it is the summer of fear, folks.
[00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:30.232]  But do not be afraid.
[00:24:30.312 --> 00:24:30.972]  Fear not.
[00:24:31.883 --> 00:24:36.207]  Fear nothing but fear itself, a globalist once said.
[00:24:36.227 --> 00:24:37.328]  And he was right!
[00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:38.649]  He was right about that, anyway.
[00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.974]  Something else FDR said, and he also said there are no accidents in politics.
[00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:46.256]  I happen to agree with that as well.
[00:24:46.997 --> 00:24:50.260]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:24:51.455 --> 00:24:54.877]  And I do the radio program right after Alex every day on this very network.
[00:24:54.897 --> 00:24:55.858]  Hope you can all tune in.
[00:24:55.878 --> 00:24:57.979]  We've got a lot of news and we're going to take a lot of your calls.
[00:24:57.999 --> 00:25:01.902]  We've got Darja Mel coming up in the second hour to give us some updates on Iraq.
[00:25:02.402 --> 00:25:06.444]  And we are going to continue to bring you all the news fit to suppress.
[00:25:06.484 --> 00:25:07.305]  Recent story...
[00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:14.230]  Just breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com, Penn Bytes, Paul Joseph Watson talks about another terror plot.
[00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.232]  Cook Terror Plot recycles politics of fear.
[00:25:18.273 --> 00:25:23.636]  CIA to plan to fly planes in the London skyscrapers concocted by government lobbyists.
[00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:37.146]  So we've got the terror ring here of low IQ, desperate teenagers who took a couple of bucks to make a video, and the next thing you know they're blamed on bombing the Silverstein Tower, sorry, the Sears Towers.
[00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:39.742]  Here's the event in England.
[00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:43.644]  Another bizarre example of Tony Blair's government playing with the politics of fear.
[00:25:43.664 --> 00:25:49.827]  A discredited terror plot concerning Al-Qaeda plans to fly planes into London's skyscrapers.
[00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:55.030]  An admitted fairy tale manufactured by government lobbyists resurfaced today as a new story.
[00:25:55.785 --> 00:25:56.065]  That's right.
[00:25:56.266 --> 00:25:58.628]  They don't even have to go out and create new events.
[00:25:58.648 --> 00:26:04.894]  They just recycle the stories over and over again because, of course, most of us fall down the memory hole and forget what happened.
[00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:16.486]  The BBC reports that a Department of Homeland Security dossier verifies a previous Al-Qaeda plan to hijack airplanes from Heathrow Airport and fly them into nearby Canary Wharf buildings.
[00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:27.670]  The fact that this story was thoroughly discredited back in November of 2004 as a collusion of imaginative government lobbyists and lapdog media collaborators is completely omitted.
[00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:41.360]  Immediately before the Queen's speech, Blair's government needed to inject a dose of fear into the political landscape in order to enable their ID cards and anti-terror legislation to hit the ground running.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:49.786]  So it was that two daily mail and ITN news journalists, renowned for fraternizing socially with Blair's
[00:26:50.186 --> 00:26:56.254]  Hierarchy met with government lobbyists to cook up a terror plot and it was reported a week later as bona fide news.
[00:26:56.295 --> 00:27:03.805]  At the time, police and intelligence officials were baffled as to where the information had come from and totally distanced themselves from it.
[00:27:04.542 --> 00:27:08.305]  To say we were surprised at the report is an understatement.
[00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:11.067]  This is the first we have heard of a plot like this.
[00:27:11.148 --> 00:27:17.773]  Another said, quote, no one has been charged for this so-called plot, which suggests it never happened.
[00:27:18.253 --> 00:27:24.478]  Even Labor's own Peter Hayne, the leader of Commons, declared the so-called plot to be bogus.
[00:27:24.739 --> 00:27:33.406]  Quote, despite having the information for several days and possibly longer than a week, the newspaper and television program held the stories until just before the Queen's speech.
[00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:38.243]  Which contain bills to introduce a biometric ID card.
[00:27:38.563 --> 00:27:46.367]  An FBI-style organized crime agency and other anti-terrorist measures, said the London Independent, noting the suspicions timing of the leak.
[00:27:47.047 --> 00:28:02.434]  In another bizarre parallel, earlier May 2004, BBC Panorama documentary stimulated a terror attack on Canary Wharf, causing many shocked viewers to believe the event was real, provoking hundreds of subsequent complaints.
[00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:18.260]  Again, putting together a documentary, or a mockumentary in this case, showing terrorists flying into buildings in London, and trying to, again, instill this fear in the viewers.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:28.443]  And I remember, it wasn't too long ago, on Nightline, they aired a war game in which Madeleine Albright pretended to be President, and the war game was
[00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:51.657]  That the entire world had been victims unleashed of a bubonic plague, or of a biological attack, and they sat around a round table with all the leaders of the world and discussed how they were going to vaccinate everybody, how they were going to use the vaccinations for political purposes, should they give them to the Middle East or not, because again, they are our enemy,
[00:28:52.217 --> 00:28:53.738]  And it looks so real.
[00:28:53.778 --> 00:29:06.342]  I mean, if you didn't know, and a lot of people don't know that Madeleine Albright wasn't president or isn't president, but it looks so real and there was no explanation that if you were out of the loop and politically ignorant, you would not know that from the real thing.
[00:29:06.362 --> 00:29:15.426]  And let's face it, folks, and if you ever watched jaywalking or if you've ever watched any of these, you know, game shows, you'll have noticed that people don't even know who the vice president is.
[00:29:16.135 --> 00:29:19.759]  So, they are very susceptible to this type of an attack.
[00:29:20.219 --> 00:29:34.974]  The fabled Canary War plot is just another one in the never-ending deluge of phony terror alerts pumped out at a politically expedient time in an attempt to quell dissent against the Blair government and the Bush government, the Howard government, and all governments around the world.
[00:29:34.994 --> 00:29:35.495]  Stay tuned, folks.
[00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:35.955]  We'll come back.
[00:29:35.975 --> 00:29:36.976]  We'll go right to your calls.
[00:29:37.197 --> 00:29:39.439]  This is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:51.696 --> 00:29:54.757]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.597 --> 00:29:58.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:09.921]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:11.982]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.182 --> 00:30:13.362]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.683 --> 00:30:19.789]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.733]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:31:01.636 --> 00:31:05.540]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.205]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.465 --> 00:31:21.835]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:26.359]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:27.340]  We're good to go!
[00:31:41.596 --> 00:31:41.876]  I think so.
[00:32:01.724 --> 00:32:06.129]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[00:32:06.309 --> 00:32:11.995]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[00:32:12.355 --> 00:32:17.260]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.025]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[00:32:22.305 --> 00:32:28.590]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.432]  Xango is revolutionary.
[00:32:30.632 --> 00:32:40.640]  Not only has Xango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Xango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.102]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[00:32:43.422 --> 00:32:45.044]  Unleash the power of Zango today!

[00:34:13.304 --> 00:34:19.507]  Of course, he's getting ready for the massive 9-11 Neocon Agenda Conference in Los Angeles.
[00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:22.247]  And, as Alex said, a lot of buzz on this.
[00:34:22.388 --> 00:34:23.728]  And this is exactly what we need.
[00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:26.589]  We need to get out and do whatever we can to bring this
[00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:39.052]  Issue of 9-11 and the neocon agenda to the public at large and so far so good It's working and as I say when things start to work Don't don't lay off redouble your efforts

[00:34:41.777 --> 00:34:43.138]  Let's talk to some of you renegades.

[00:34:51.721 --> 00:34:55.323]  First up is Mike in Texas.
[00:34:55.603 --> 00:34:56.504]  Mike, thank you for holding.
[00:34:56.524 --> 00:34:57.624]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:58.024 --> 00:34:58.405]  Hey, Jack.
[00:34:58.445 --> 00:34:58.865]  How are you, buddy?
[00:34:59.025 --> 00:34:59.325]  Very good.
[00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:07.601]  Hey, I was wondering if you could get a hold of Rick Santorum, because I was out in my backyard this morning, and I think I found a couple hundred weapons of mass destruction.
[00:35:07.621 --> 00:35:11.243]  You found some old coke bottles that were buried, and they could be toxic.
[00:35:11.463 --> 00:35:13.384]  Those could be used and given to the terrorists.
[00:35:13.844 --> 00:35:19.746]  Well, I'll tell you what, that was almost as funny as watching Geraldo last night talk about his combat experience.
[00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.707]  He was ripping John Kerry's butt off.
[00:35:22.807 --> 00:35:23.668]  Unbelievable.
[00:35:23.748 --> 00:35:25.889]  Geraldo and Bill O'Reilly together.
[00:35:25.909 --> 00:35:28.890]  Shouldn't they do their own show on the Comedy Channel?
[00:35:29.574 --> 00:35:34.356]  Actually, you know, O'Reilly could probably do a show on sexual harassment because of that tape of him.
[00:35:34.396 --> 00:35:36.577]  But anyway, I wanted to ask you real quick.
[00:35:36.617 --> 00:35:43.820]  I've heard you talk before, and I think you do a heck of a job, and I'm not sucking up or nothing, but you mentioned your website one day, and what is it?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.261]  Because I'm just curious.
[00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:49.003]  Well, it's kind of hard, but I try to make it simple for people.
[00:35:49.083 --> 00:35:50.663]  It's jackblood.com.
[00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:52.044]  How's that?
[00:35:52.705 --> 00:35:53.185]  Easy enough.
[00:35:53.605 --> 00:35:54.906]  You know my name and put a dot com.
[00:35:54.926 --> 00:35:56.667]  In fact, you don't even have to put the dot com.
[00:35:56.707 --> 00:36:02.910]  Just Google my name and then you get to read all of my stalker's notes that are generally always at the top of Google.
[00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:09.933]  So you can read what a big sellout I am and how I beat my wife or I don't know what they're making up today.
[00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:11.214]  I can't even keep up with it anymore.
[00:36:11.234 --> 00:36:11.714]  But it's simple.
[00:36:11.754 --> 00:36:12.655]  Just Google Jack Blood.
[00:36:12.675 --> 00:36:15.096]  You'll get several pages of information and the website.
[00:36:15.696 --> 00:36:16.597]  Well, actually, you know what?
[00:36:16.617 --> 00:36:17.837]  I think it's very interesting.
[00:36:17.857 --> 00:36:19.118]  The same guys that say that
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.463]  Take pride in Ann Coulter saying that basically John Murtha should be killed.
[00:36:24.203 --> 00:36:30.948]  Well, the same people that say that call the FBI and other people and snitch on other people, so let's listen to them, you know?
[00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.689]  Yeah, buddy.
[00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:32.630]  I appreciate your time.
[00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.490]  You're doing a great job.
[00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.051]  Thank you very much for being who you are.
[00:36:35.392 --> 00:36:35.932]  You got it!
[00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:37.360]  Thank you for the call.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.283]  Yeah, chemical weapons too old to use, says the U.S.
[00:36:41.364 --> 00:36:42.685]  intelligence officials.
[00:36:42.705 --> 00:36:45.748]  This has been brought to the Department of Defense.
[00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:48.090]  I mean, look, the White House doesn't really want to comment on it.
[00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.494]  The Department of Defense is taking the line now because Centorum really stepped in it.
[00:36:53.189 --> 00:36:54.770]  And so did Sean Vanity and the rest.
[00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:01.953]  They really all stepped in it, but they're taking the line that, well, those could, those were dangerous, this was poison, this could hurt people.
[00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:12.858]  Well, obviously you can go to your kitchen sink right now and find a lot of weapons of mass destruction that does not justify trillions of dollars of expenditures, hundreds of thousands of lives, including over 2,500 of our own.
[00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:17.348]  And, of course, the loss of liberties, etc., etc., etc.
[00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:19.629]  No, those aren't weapons of mass destruction.
[00:37:20.289 --> 00:37:21.749]  It's poison at this point.
[00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:23.950]  But, well, Saddam Hussein had poison.
[00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.250]  You see?
[00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.110]  We were right all along.
[00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.111]  Let's go to Charles in Louisiana.
[00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:28.411]  Charles, I'm glad you called in.
[00:37:28.431 --> 00:37:29.432]  I was hoping you would.
[00:37:29.452 --> 00:37:31.632]  Because I wanted somebody from Louisiana to call in.
[00:37:31.652 --> 00:37:34.413]  And if they could, tell us what's going on down there.
[00:37:34.453 --> 00:37:36.094]  Because the National Guard was called down.
[00:37:36.574 --> 00:37:41.817]  Looks like curfews for children, for juveniles, are being put in place in New Orleans.
[00:37:41.977 --> 00:37:43.558]  We want to find out what's going on down there.
[00:37:43.978 --> 00:37:44.779]  Have you seen anything yet?
[00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:47.641]  Well, yeah, I go down there every two weeks to see my aunt.
[00:37:48.341 --> 00:37:49.762]  And I went down there last week.
[00:37:50.402 --> 00:37:51.703]  The National Guard wasn't out.
[00:37:51.743 --> 00:37:53.284]  But let me explain this to you, Jack.
[00:37:53.984 --> 00:37:58.587]  Sometimes, in a night before, there's seven or eight killings a day.
[00:37:58.607 --> 00:37:59.868]  You don't hear about them.
[00:38:00.308 --> 00:38:03.390]  But five kids got killed and ran into a light post.
[00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:05.690]  So they call out the National Guard.
[00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.071]  They say crime rate's so bad.
[00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:09.493]  But crime rate's always been bad in New Orleans.
[00:38:09.693 --> 00:38:11.374]  I lived there for a year myself.
[00:38:11.454 --> 00:38:11.935]  I'm very aware of that.
[00:38:11.955 --> 00:38:13.996]  You know, in the Ninth Ward, the police don't even go back there.
[00:38:14.016 --> 00:38:14.196]  Yeah.
[00:38:14.797 --> 00:38:18.640]  And when they confiscated them guns, they didn't go in the Ninth Ward to confiscate them.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.641]  They went on Esplanade and St.
[00:38:20.681 --> 00:38:21.302]  Charles Street.
[00:38:21.662 --> 00:38:21.882]  Right.
[00:38:22.002 --> 00:38:24.604]  And took the decent people's money, you know?
[00:38:24.664 --> 00:38:26.846]  And ended up on the magazine street, you know?
[00:38:26.866 --> 00:38:27.506]  Right, right.
[00:38:27.626 --> 00:38:29.187]  You know, like that old woman they took in jail?
[00:38:29.287 --> 00:38:30.028]  Yeah.
[00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.709]  But anyway, they're down there right now.
[00:38:31.729 --> 00:38:32.610]  I talked to my aunt.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.001]  They're just running around.
[00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:35.201]  They're running through your house right now.
[00:38:35.221 --> 00:38:38.564]  If they hear a shot, they'll come knocking on your door and run right through your house now.
[00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:39.284]  You know?
[00:38:39.604 --> 00:38:48.630]  Looking for a... You know, you get the feeling if you live in Louisiana or New Orleans, as I said I have, Los Angeles or California in general was the police super state.
[00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:52.372]  But now I'm seeing a lot of tests going on in Louisiana.
[00:38:52.392 --> 00:38:59.437]  And this all started, Charles, as I'm sure you know, about two years ago when the Fed snapped up all the authority for New Orleans.
[00:38:59.617 --> 00:39:03.038]  All over and superseding even the state of Louisiana itself.
[00:39:03.078 --> 00:39:05.258]  So you can kind of see the writing on the wall.
[00:39:05.498 --> 00:39:09.959]  And all they needed was the right event, which coincidentally enough came in Hurricane Katrina.
[00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:10.259]  Yeah.
[00:39:10.419 --> 00:39:12.140]  Well, DeBlanco likes all this.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.060]  She likes to talk about my soldiers are cocked and loaded.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.401]  They won't shoot.
[00:39:17.661 --> 00:39:18.621]  She likes all this.
[00:39:18.681 --> 00:39:19.241]  You know what I mean?
[00:39:19.381 --> 00:39:20.321]  Makes her feel powerful.
[00:39:20.361 --> 00:39:23.122]  They just gave us a nasty email about
[00:39:23.615 --> 00:39:31.817]  The other day, she got thousands of emails saying that they voted their self-lifetime insurance, you know, in ten years, and she's going to have to veto that bill.
[00:39:32.117 --> 00:39:32.317]  Yeah.
[00:39:32.417 --> 00:39:34.518]  But they shoved her.
[00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:49.721]  And at one point, you think that Negan, in the beginning of Hurricane Katrina, is doing the right thing, calling out the government, getting the word out that they're not getting help, exposing, you know, some of the plots and plans of the feds, and the next thing you know, he's doing everything they say.
[00:39:49.741 --> 00:39:53.202]  I mean, you get the feeling that they threatened him with a complete
[00:39:53.302 --> 00:39:54.103]  We're good to go.
[00:40:15.009 --> 00:40:15.589]  In the pets.
[00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:17.750]  Well, you better believe it's coming, Charles.
[00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.471]  I mean, right now, of course, the report came out today, the planet's hotter than ever.
[00:40:21.531 --> 00:40:28.594]  Of course, we know the Gulf is starting to cook right now, and that's the perfect ingredient and alchemy for another giant storm.
[00:40:28.634 --> 00:40:34.596]  In fact, I think they've predicted at least four major Cat 4 storms are going to hit the United States and the Gulf this year.
[00:40:34.776 --> 00:40:34.916]  Yeah.
[00:40:35.116 --> 00:40:36.197]  Well, New Orleans is finished.
[00:40:36.217 --> 00:40:42.519]  I mean, Louisiana, believe it or not, Jack, and I'm just saying this, Louisiana is so dumb, it's finished.
[00:40:43.038 --> 00:40:49.723]  Look, last night when I wanted to report on you on Nightline, they're saying our biggest threat is homegrown terrorism.
[00:40:49.884 --> 00:40:50.084]  Yeah.
[00:40:50.344 --> 00:40:52.686]  And they're using the internet to recruit people.
[00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:57.630]  And I wanted to ask you, because I heard you talk about it before, when are they going to shut down the internet?
[00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:05.840]  Well, look, one thing they're going to do is they're going to shut people like myself and Alex Jones and groups like YouTube out of the Internet.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.102]  That's what's going on right now.
[00:41:07.122 --> 00:41:13.571]  And if we don't stop them, if we don't get a hold of the Senate and tell them there are going to be dire consequences if they outprice us and
[00:41:13.951 --> 00:41:19.056]  They basically sold us out to the telecom companies, the same usual suspects, AT&T and the rest of the gang.
[00:41:19.336 --> 00:41:21.118]  Sold us out for lobbyist money.
[00:41:21.418 --> 00:41:22.579]  So that's the first step.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.702]  The second step is already happening.
[00:41:24.742 --> 00:41:30.267]  It's being put into place where every day there's a new event on MySpace that is just criminal.
[00:41:30.607 --> 00:41:36.913]  Every day there's a new event on a chat room which catches a group of terrorists plotting and planning to blow up buildings.
[00:41:36.973 --> 00:41:37.354]  So look,
[00:41:37.614 --> 00:41:39.415]  They've got now the pretext.
[00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:40.555]  This is the problem.
[00:41:40.775 --> 00:41:44.237]  They're already using the news cycle to put forth a reaction.
[00:41:44.537 --> 00:41:46.138]  And yes, you better believe it, Charles.
[00:41:46.298 --> 00:41:47.178]  They got a solution.
[00:41:47.278 --> 00:41:47.859]  Listen to this.
[00:41:48.299 --> 00:41:54.282]  Now the police down there, they've been told you can't gun confiscate, but the police say they're going to do it anyway.
[00:41:55.082 --> 00:41:57.143]  And so I tried to call on a talk show.
[00:41:57.483 --> 00:42:01.825]  They said if you protect your property and your guns not conceal,
[00:42:02.236 --> 00:42:06.698]  And a policeman walks up to you, he'll take the gun away and give it to you on a later date.
[00:42:06.738 --> 00:42:15.002]  What you need to do is roll back emergency powers acts and war powers acts and these types of things which generally supersede state and federal constitutions.
[00:42:15.382 --> 00:42:19.684]  I mean, without doing that, they'll be able to get away with just about anything they want.
[00:42:19.804 --> 00:42:24.406]  Well, Jack, I know people think they get tired of me talking about giving these tapes out, Alex tapes.
[00:42:24.746 --> 00:42:26.187]  That's the only way I know how to do it.
[00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:27.508]  I'm played out on it.
[00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:29.168]  I don't have no more to give.
[00:42:29.268 --> 00:42:30.329]  I mean, for eight years,
[00:42:31.158 --> 00:42:34.340]  You know, I've been giving, and I don't have no more to give.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.903]  Charles, man, if we had everybody doing as much as you, we'd be in pretty good shape pretty fast.
[00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:46.249]  In fact, the caller called in the other day and said that, you know, if everybody got together and opposed this government, we'd have it back in 12 hours.
[00:42:46.449 --> 00:42:47.870]  Well, you know, it hurts me.
[00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:56.896]  How can a man have a family and go to sleep and tell them, I love you, and he's going to protect her, knowing that this kid don't have a future, Jack?
[00:42:57.386 --> 00:42:58.927]  They won't support the programs.
[00:42:59.248 --> 00:43:04.572]  I tried, Jack, I tried, I passed out... Charles, we never had a future that we didn't fight for.
[00:43:04.732 --> 00:43:06.514]  And I'll tell you, it just gets my blood up.
[00:43:06.734 --> 00:43:07.295]  You know what I mean?
[00:43:07.335 --> 00:43:08.195]  No pun intended.
[00:43:08.576 --> 00:43:09.516]  It gets me up.
[00:43:09.577 --> 00:43:10.858]  It gets me excited.
[00:43:10.938 --> 00:43:16.462]  I feel alive knowing that I'm fighting for the future of my children and my grandchildren.
[00:43:16.723 --> 00:43:17.924]  And we just got to keep that going.
[00:43:17.944 --> 00:43:20.666]  We got to pass the proverbial torch, excuse the expression.
[00:43:20.926 --> 00:43:22.688]  I want to thank you for what you're doing, Jack.
[00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:23.569]  I really do.
[00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:25.010]  You know, I love you and the Lord.
[00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:26.991]  I guess I'm just tired now, Jack.
[00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:28.413]  I guess I'm just tired, my friend.
[00:43:28.593 --> 00:43:29.173]  Keep going.
[00:43:29.233 --> 00:43:30.374]  Keep what you're doing, Charles.
[00:43:30.394 --> 00:43:31.295]  You're doing a great job.
[00:43:31.315 --> 00:43:31.955]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:31.975 --> 00:43:32.556]  God bless you.
[00:43:32.596 --> 00:43:33.557]  Have a great weekend.
[00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.298]  Let's go to Moses in Texas.
[00:43:35.358 --> 00:43:36.719]  Moses, thank you for calling in.
[00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:38.000]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:39.321]  Good afternoon, Jack.
[00:43:39.581 --> 00:43:40.122]  Good afternoon.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.163]  Um, I just have a couple quick takes before I jump off the line.
[00:43:43.384 --> 00:43:43.544]  Okay.
[00:43:43.844 --> 00:43:46.828]  Um, Alexander, the BFG Emory Jones just called in.
[00:43:46.848 --> 00:43:49.231]  And you're talking about the entrapment with the FBI.
[00:43:49.792 --> 00:43:51.814]  Well, that was before the Patriot Act.
[00:43:51.835 --> 00:43:53.356]  Well, that was before the Patriot Act.
[00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:54.438]  I mean, the Patriot Act.
[00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:57.382]  Now they're effing bullies and intimidators, the FBI.
[00:43:57.642 --> 00:43:58.463]  Yeah.
[00:43:58.783 --> 00:43:59.745]  And B.A.T.S.
[00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:00.525]  and all the rest, yeah.
[00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:28.052]  Okay, well, you know, he was on Love, Loser, Larson, I mean, Lars Larson, maybe like two weeks ago, and some citizens called in and really kind of smacked Fletcher around, so I'm glad to hear that he made an improvement.
[00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:31.735]  But like I said, Jack, I have a couple quick takes, and I'll jump off the line.
[00:44:31.915 --> 00:44:32.455]  Go.
[00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:40.800]  The only thing I ask of you, Jack, is that if you have any questions for me or statements, just before I get dropped off the line, that you just... Just go and get it out, because we've got a lot of calls.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.280]  Go for it.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.101]  I'm giving you the floor.
[00:44:43.117 --> 00:44:47.980]  Well, first, I'd like to thank GCN and other networks, mine is its owner, for the work that you do.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.142]  I can sincerely thank you, these networks, plus the Internet.
[00:44:51.462 --> 00:44:57.566]  Speaking of Internet, if you look at it in the scope of history, not in its modernity, then this is the main reason why you might have a slim chance in hell.
[00:44:57.866 --> 00:45:11.234]  And to the Collins out there, like Charles in Louisiana, Kevin Smith, Stuart, Gail, Watson, Scott Horton, Jeff and Max, Rita and Rodney, my fellow Texans, you give me faith and hope.
[00:45:11.957 --> 00:45:16.060]  All I ask that you do is listen to closely to what I say, and if I'm wrong, correct me.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.602]  Or maybe, Jack, you're going to lie to me and pull me out of the shadows.
[00:45:19.002 --> 00:45:21.324]  Quickly, does anybody have any background on Silverstein?
[00:45:21.604 --> 00:45:24.907]  I'm just guessing, but if somebody does the search, I bet it's a panic.
[00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:27.649]  Now, the Super Bowl conference that you have happening in L.A.
[00:45:27.689 --> 00:45:36.956]  this weekend, I hope that you pull out some unity strategy and a little organization out of it, because the other side is, I'm not going to put a one-hour phone argument in a five-minute debate with you.
[00:45:37.476 --> 00:45:40.038]  And after these quick takes, maybe you'll see why.
[00:45:40.058 --> 00:45:43.581]  Well, you just made several takes, so I gotta have you call back, man.
[00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:46.183]  I mean, I can't give you ten minutes when we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:45:46.223 --> 00:45:48.605]  So, look, we gotta manage our time, all of us.
[00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:51.647]  And since I'm sitting at the helm here, I guess I have to manage all of you.
[00:45:51.687 --> 00:45:57.432]  But I appreciate the comments, Moses, and I especially liked your comment and your call out to the fellow Texans that give you faith.
[00:45:57.612 --> 00:45:58.813]  I mean, that's what it's all about, folks.
[00:45:59.033 --> 00:46:00.274]  We need each other.
[00:46:00.534 --> 00:46:04.417]  And as far as a unity strategy at the conference in Los Angeles, the conference itself
[00:46:04.697 --> 00:46:05.197]  Thank you, Jack Blood.
[00:46:05.217 --> 00:46:06.197]  I must say you're doing a splendid job.
[00:46:06.217 --> 00:46:09.038]  As far as filling out my wish list and probably the wish list of many others,
[00:46:34.617 --> 00:46:41.840]  As far as touching off some really heavy stuff, the immigration, the Trans-Texas Corridor, wonderfully done.
[00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:50.064]  I was wondering, since this is a radio show, and if you keep up with traditional radio shows and maybe take a request, maybe see about getting Mr. Tancredo back on.
[00:46:53.425 --> 00:46:55.626]  He's not doing my show.
[00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:56.067]  I'll tell you that.
[00:46:56.087 --> 00:46:59.048]  He's not returning my calls anymore and he used to get right on the phone with me.
[00:46:59.848 --> 00:47:00.248]  That's a shame.
[00:47:00.268 --> 00:47:05.851]  He did Liddy with Mr. Corsi and I didn't get to hear it because of a time conflict with Alex Jones.
[00:47:06.471 --> 00:47:06.951]  Can't have that.
[00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:08.332]  But anyway, that would be wonderful.
[00:47:08.352 --> 00:47:08.892]  How about this?
[00:47:08.972 --> 00:47:10.593]  You guys call Tancredo.
[00:47:10.633 --> 00:47:11.753]  You write Tancredo.
[00:47:11.793 --> 00:47:15.574]  You tell him to do the Jack Blood and Alex Jones Show on GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:15.654 --> 00:47:16.094]  You know what?
[00:47:16.114 --> 00:47:16.535]  That's a bet.
[00:47:16.575 --> 00:47:16.935]  I'll do it.
[00:47:17.035 --> 00:47:20.256]  And I also was going to say, KT Ordnance is back up online.
[00:47:20.296 --> 00:47:21.636]  Have you talked to the gentleman who runs it?
[00:47:21.676 --> 00:47:22.397]  Yeah, I have.
[00:47:22.417 --> 00:47:24.337]  In fact, we talked yesterday to Aaron Zellman.
[00:47:24.377 --> 00:47:25.658]  He gave us an update on that.
[00:47:25.698 --> 00:47:28.519]  They are back online, but they're not allowed to do business.
[00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:31.021]  A lot of their property was confiscated.
[00:47:31.041 --> 00:47:32.602]  All their computers were confiscated.
[00:47:32.823 --> 00:47:34.444]  Their hard drives were bugged.
[00:47:34.844 --> 00:47:36.986]  Okay, this is what the BATF and the FBI do.
[00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:37.847]  All of this is illegal.
[00:47:37.987 --> 00:47:40.750]  They have no case on them because obviously there's no charges.
[00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:43.232]  Well, you know, there are other sites out there selling the 80%.
[00:47:44.608 --> 00:47:44.988]  Yeah, I know.
[00:47:45.148 --> 00:47:46.349]  I understand.
[00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:49.230]  They pretty much can assume that they're going to be targets as well.
[00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.730]  But that's okay.
[00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.251]  Stand up to them and keep doing it.
[00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:58.813]  I'm not going to say if I'm geared up or not, but I'll let you go ahead and make an educated guess.
[00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:00.154]  Thanks for the call, Todd.
[00:48:00.174 --> 00:48:00.654]  Appreciate it.
[00:48:00.674 --> 00:48:01.334]  Have a good weekend.
[00:48:01.654 --> 00:48:02.995]  Jason in Maryland.
[00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:04.775]  You're up on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:09.157]  Hi, I was wondering if you could tell me whatever you know about the
[00:48:10.215 --> 00:48:16.761]  Global bankers speaking openly about the destruction of the dollar in their periodicals and how they can come out on top of that.
[00:48:17.421 --> 00:48:20.444]  Well, that's a mighty question you just asked, Jason.
[00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:21.825]  Where do I start?
[00:48:22.794 --> 00:48:40.952]  Obviously the global bankers at several Bilderberg conferences going back now tens, twenties, thirties years ago have openly discussed the destroying of all currency to unify them under one currency which will generally be an electronic
[00:48:41.332 --> 00:48:41.873]  Currency.
[00:48:41.913 --> 00:48:44.114]  This, again, alleviates paper trails.
[00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:47.457]  This is what, of course, the big boys are doing, the corporate chieftains.
[00:48:47.497 --> 00:48:55.243]  They are now writing software programs to eliminate any paper trails, which, of course, keeps them clear of any Enron-style investigations.
[00:48:55.563 --> 00:49:00.947]  But for the rest of us, the goal is, and we're looking at it now, to unify currencies.
[00:49:01.007 --> 00:49:03.749]  This is what's happened with the Euro, with the EU.
[00:49:03.769 --> 00:49:06.612]  Of course, now it's being predicted very accurately, I think.
[00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:10.815]  We're going to get an Amero dollar here for the American and then future
[00:49:11.155 --> 00:49:26.069]  Pan-American Union, and then at that point you're going to get a global dollar, a global currency, which will all be credit either on your little card, your little biometric card, passport, one-size-fits-all, or your subdermal microchip.
[00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:30.053]  I mean, that's the plan, and they'll do whatever they have to do to get there, but
[00:49:30.533 --> 00:49:34.276]  They're going to do so incrementally, which is exactly what we need to do.
[00:49:34.537 --> 00:49:36.859]  We need to do things incrementally.
[00:49:36.999 --> 00:49:43.905]  Obviously, if we can take a big bite, we'll do it, but incrementally, we've got to keep rolling this stuff back, and I believe we've done that.
[00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:47.348]  You know, if we would have just stood and done nothing two years ago,
[00:49:47.708 --> 00:49:51.110]  The FTAA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, would have gone through.
[00:49:51.150 --> 00:50:00.754]  We would have extended this quote-unquote free trade all the way to the tip of the continent, north and south, and we would already be locked into the Pan-American Union.
[00:50:00.955 --> 00:50:09.219]  They are several years behind in their plan, and already in Europe, people are starting to question the euro as well.
[00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:13.681]  So, that's the plan, and you know, look, this is what
[00:50:14.793 --> 00:50:19.014]  I'm starting to wonder with the fact that they are years behind and that the wheels seem to be coming off for them with
[00:50:35.956 --> 00:50:39.238]  Japan's premier newspaper is saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:50:39.278 --> 00:50:40.179]  They're getting desperate.
[00:50:40.379 --> 00:50:49.506]  I'm starting to wonder if incrementalism is still the, uh... Well, I mean, that's been their plan for a hundred years, and they've had their backs to the wall before.
[00:50:49.786 --> 00:50:50.787]  Thanks for the call, Jason.
[00:50:50.807 --> 00:50:51.447]  We'll come right back.
[00:50:51.487 --> 00:50:53.649]  Try to play this clip of Jim Fetzer right after this.
[00:50:53.669 --> 00:50:54.229]  Stay tuned.
[00:50:59.293 --> 00:51:02.155]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:02.885 --> 00:51:04.187]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:04.367 --> 00:51:10.115]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:10.395 --> 00:51:15.662]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:15.943 --> 00:51:17.565]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:51:17.745 --> 00:51:20.106]  The program for world domination has blown wide open.
[00:51:20.266 --> 00:51:24.028]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:24.308 --> 00:51:28.931]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:29.011 --> 00:51:35.274]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:35.334 --> 00:51:37.155]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:52:00.382 --> 00:52:04.503]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:04.623 --> 00:52:07.504]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:07.584 --> 00:52:14.307]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:14.487 --> 00:52:17.488]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:17.688 --> 00:52:20.089]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:20.209 --> 00:52:24.931]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:25.111 --> 00:52:39.703]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:58.456]  All in all you're just a little brick in the wall.
[00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:06.452]  We don't need no education.
[00:55:09.933 --> 00:55:11.654]  We don't need no education.
[00:55:11.694 --> 00:55:12.995]  We need knowledge.
[00:55:13.575 --> 00:55:15.056]  Knowledge is power.
[00:55:16.537 --> 00:55:19.318]  We're going to play that Jim Fetzer clip for you just after dark.
[00:55:19.498 --> 00:55:22.439]  Jamal leaves us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:22.459 --> 00:55:24.140]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.882]  I'm Jack Blood, again, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:55:26.942 --> 00:55:29.743]  Alex will be back, or is scheduled to be back, on Monday.
[00:55:30.316 --> 00:55:34.260]  Hopefully everything goes well, and we'll have Alex back in the chair in the InfoWars studios.
[00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:41.288]  Real quick, let me just say, the best way to wake people up are the films of Alex Jones.
[00:55:41.728 --> 00:55:42.969]  And I've seen a lot of films.
[00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:43.710]  They're all good.
[00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:50.858]  I mean, documentary films with knowledge, something now really spinning out of control, and we've seen a lot of them loose change.
[00:55:50.878 --> 00:55:52.519]  Of course, we carry that here at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.701]  But the films of Alex Jones are excellent.
[00:55:55.821 --> 00:55:57.902]  I've seen the new film, Terror Storm.
[00:55:57.922 --> 00:56:00.323]  It is absolutely unbelievable.
[00:56:00.343 --> 00:56:03.244]  You guys are going to really love this film when it comes out.
[00:56:03.264 --> 00:56:09.506]  But there are so many films that Alex has now available that are still valid, still very, very good, and very, very hot.
[00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:14.734]  Marshall Waugh, 9-11, Rise of the Police State is three films in one.
[00:56:14.794 --> 00:56:16.356]  I was on the ground in New York City.
[00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:20.499]  I saw the police state assembled for the Bush coronation ceremony in 2004.
[00:56:21.759 --> 00:56:26.943]  Also, this video gets into the connections of the Bush family to Hitler and the Nazis.
[00:56:27.243 --> 00:56:29.105]  It sets out the full
[00:56:29.905 --> 00:56:32.226]  Uh, story about state-sponsored terrorism.
[00:56:32.246 --> 00:56:33.407]  From Oklahoma City to 9-11.
[00:56:33.627 --> 00:56:36.028]  A lot of new evidence about 9-11 in this film.
[00:56:36.068 --> 00:56:37.549]  This film is still excellent.
[00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:38.589]  Excellent film.
[00:56:38.609 --> 00:56:38.870]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:39.010]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:42.571]  There are a number of specials as well that you can ask for when you give us a call.
[00:56:42.591 --> 00:56:42.691]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:42.711 --> 00:56:45.173]  I still think one of the best things you can do is subscribe.
[00:56:54.577 --> 00:57:10.425]  to prison planet dot TV there is a huge amount of resources there for information it's 5495 for the entire year there are specials going on for the months prison planet dot TV you can see everything from weather control to
[00:57:11.285 --> 00:57:14.208]  Alex's interview with Dean Haglin from the X-Files.
[00:57:14.528 --> 00:57:17.471]  That's really always very entertaining and always very informative.
[00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:20.173]  A number of Alex's selective works and appearances.
[00:57:20.193 --> 00:57:25.218]  You get to see his local cable access TV show, which I watch several times a week here.
[00:57:25.938 --> 00:57:28.080]  Just a ton of great information there.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.461]  It's about anything you want to know about.
[00:57:29.662 --> 00:57:33.525]  And that's really probably the most cost-effective way to get all of this information.
[00:57:33.545 --> 00:57:36.568]  So every one of you should be a subscriber to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:45.735]  Look, and this is the thing, folks, we don't have enough money to do everything we want, but let's not go to a movie this weekend.
[00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:55.203]  Let's take a little bit of sacrifice and get one of these films, make a bunch of copies for everybody, get them out for educational, not-for-profit purposes.
[00:57:55.916 --> 00:58:10.790]  And you support the network, you support this growing operation here, the InfoWars operation, the operation of Alex Jones, all the money coming in, the largest portion of it going right back into expanding the operation, to getting the word out to more people.
[00:58:11.031 --> 00:58:12.172]  You get to be a part of it!
[00:58:12.712 --> 00:58:13.532]  That's what it's all about.
[00:58:13.612 --> 00:58:14.933]  We all get to work together.
[00:58:14.953 --> 00:58:15.753]  This is your part.
[00:58:15.913 --> 00:58:17.494]  It's a win-win-win situation.
[00:58:17.554 --> 00:58:21.575]  Go to the InfoWars store, InfoWars.com, or give us a call at AAA-253-3139.
[00:58:21.675 --> 00:58:29.158]  We're going to come right back, go to Dar Jamal, get some inside information on what's going on in Iraq.
[00:58:29.378 --> 00:58:29.818]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:29.838 --> 00:58:30.958]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:30.998 --> 00:58:32.599]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:58:32.939 --> 00:58:34.920]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.340]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:43.057]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:43.097 --> 00:58:43.538]  Big Brother.
[00:58:43.698 --> 00:58:44.478]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:44.698 --> 00:58:48.781]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.942 --> 00:58:52.183]  You want answers?
[00:58:52.403 --> 00:58:53.864]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:06.228]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:10.911]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.833 --> 00:59:18.196]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way this Friday, the 23rd day of June, 2006.
[00:59:18.836 --> 00:59:27.422]  Alex, of course, in Los Angeles getting everything prepared for the thousands of people going to the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Conference.
[00:59:28.154 --> 00:59:36.887]  Great conference, great speakers, over 80 media outlets are going to be there covering this, including C-SPAN and the BBC, and of course you'll be able to see all of this.
[00:59:36.927 --> 00:59:43.216]  Another reason to subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv because you're going to be the first ones to see some of these speeches at the conferences.
[00:59:43.556 --> 00:59:48.058]  He's also going to debut his new film, Terror Storm, which I'm telling you folks is the best one yet.
[00:59:48.078 --> 00:59:50.079]  It is absolutely amazing.
[00:59:50.299 --> 00:59:51.500]  You're all going to want to get that as well.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.120]  Dar Jamal is with us.
[00:59:53.140 --> 01:00:00.524]  Dar Jamal, an unembedded reporter in Iraq who's been reporting on his blog, DarJamalIraq.com.
[01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:04.946]  Since he got back from Iraq, he keeps deep contacts in there so he knows what's going on.
[01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:09.188]  He's always apprised of the real situation going on in Iraq.
[01:00:09.228 --> 01:00:10.688]  That's why it's always good to have him.
[01:00:10.928 --> 01:00:12.209]  Dar, thanks for being on the show today.
[01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:13.547]  Thanks for having me.
[01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:15.794]  Where do we start, Dar?
[01:00:15.814 --> 01:00:18.116]  I've got so many things to ask you about Iraq.
[01:00:18.256 --> 01:00:20.418]  Obviously, Haditha is still looming.
[01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:29.266]  We've got the wholesale killing of the crippled man, which was covered up and made to look like he was a terrorist.
[01:00:29.346 --> 01:00:34.690]  That plot was uncovered and now, I guess, charges are going out against the Marines who were involved in that.
[01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:42.997]  Just recently, in fact, I think this was just today, the Iraqi government has officially declared a state of emergency and everything that goes with that.
[01:00:43.237 --> 01:00:44.057]  Where do you want to start?
[01:00:44.077 --> 01:00:45.697]  What's the most important thing you want to tell us?
[01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:55.639]  Well, I think the most important story and the most covered story at the moment is what's going on in Ramadi, the capital city of Al Anbar province.
[01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.340]  As I'm sure you're aware, the U.S.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:08.102]  has had an ongoing military siege against that city for a couple of weeks, and it's just been in the last week that it's really been spiking as far as that they are trying to push into different parts of the city.
[01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:11.083]  Using snipers very heavily to shoot into the city.
[01:01:11.503 --> 01:01:13.424]  Definitely many civilians are being killed.
[01:01:13.884 --> 01:01:16.706]  At least a couple of hundred thousand refugees have had to flee.
[01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:22.468]  So it's something along the lines of what happened in Fallujah during the first siege there, April 2004.
[01:01:22.948 --> 01:01:29.211]  And it's being so covered up that this time the military is not even allowing embedded reporters.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.341]  What is actually going on though?
[01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:33.702]  I know you got your ear to the ground over there.
[01:01:33.722 --> 01:01:42.167]  Last I heard, a lot of people were able to get out of Ramadi, though a lot of people, obviously the elderly, the sick, the crippled, not able to get out.
[01:01:42.227 --> 01:01:48.872]  All electricity was cut off, food was cut off, water was cut off, bombings had begun.
[01:01:48.892 --> 01:01:51.233]  That was just a few days ago, Dar.
[01:01:51.273 --> 01:01:52.334]  Where are we at with that now?
[01:01:53.434 --> 01:01:59.839]  It's really a continuation of the same where we have ongoing random airstrikes from the U.S.
[01:01:59.899 --> 01:02:01.239]  dropping bombs in the city.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:08.544]  We have other neighborhoods being sieged by ground troops and tanks backed by helicopters.
[01:02:09.885 --> 01:02:19.090]  A huge refugee crisis, but then we also have at the same time a large number of people staying in the city simply because they're too afraid to leave.
[01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.551]  Either they're too poor to leave or they don't have anywhere to go.
[01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:32.356]  It's rather remote in location, so it's not easy to just go out and go over to Uncle Bat Bob's house or something, you know?
[01:02:32.596 --> 01:02:34.237]  I mean, they're really literally stuck there.
[01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:35.711]  Well, that's true.
[01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.193]  It's a very large city.
[01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.696]  Geographically, it's twice the size of Fallujah.
[01:02:39.716 --> 01:02:43.641]  It has about 100,000 more people, so there's about 500,000 people that live there.
[01:02:43.701 --> 01:02:47.867]  But then, yeah, if they want to go to Baghdad, that's going to be about a 60-mile walk.
[01:02:48.548 --> 01:02:51.071]  And with many of these people too poor to even have cars.
[01:02:51.511 --> 01:02:54.813]  Or they can't go into nearby Fallujah, which is the closest town.
[01:02:54.853 --> 01:03:06.100]  It's about a 15 minute drive, but you can't go in there because they still run biometrics against Fallujah, so you have to get a retina scan and all ten fingers fingerprinted if you can't prove that you have a relative in there.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.044]  Are we going to find thousands of dead in shallow graves after this is all done?
[01:03:29.211 --> 01:03:33.494]  Well, the possibility is certainly there, because that's definitely what occurred after the second siege.
[01:03:33.514 --> 01:03:38.397]  Thank God Saddam Hussein still isn't in power, huh, Dar?
[01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:39.958]  We've really set those people free.
[01:03:40.018 --> 01:03:42.200]  Democracy has come to Iraq.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.060]  They've got to love it.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.621]  Of course, I'm being extremely sarcastic.
[01:03:44.902 --> 01:03:46.583]  Dar Jamal will be with us right when we come back.
[01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:47.443]  Folks, you stay tuned.
[01:03:47.463 --> 01:03:50.205]  This is the Alex Jones Show, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:03:59.472 --> 01:04:03.836]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:06.739]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:11.243]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:11.303 --> 01:04:18.250]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:20.392]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:20.772 --> 01:04:31.075]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:31.355 --> 01:04:36.716]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:58.709]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:10.218]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:10.438 --> 01:05:13.060]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:19.887]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:21.909]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:28.136]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:28.396 --> 01:05:33.842]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:39.123]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:05:39.163 --> 01:05:41.804]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.969]  I think so.
[01:06:23.795 --> 01:06:24.115]  I think so.
[01:06:54.895 --> 01:06:55.535]  Big Brother.
[01:06:56.196 --> 01:06:57.256]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:57.957 --> 01:06:59.137]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:59.718 --> 01:07:00.558]  You want answers?
[01:07:01.298 --> 01:07:02.219]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:02.859 --> 01:07:06.721]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:11.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.361 --> 01:07:17.187]  Jack Blood reporting for Alex Jones in the InfoWars studio.
[01:07:17.888 --> 01:07:19.171]  Alex again will be back on Monday.
[01:07:19.211 --> 01:07:20.153]  Darjamel with us.
[01:07:20.193 --> 01:07:21.876]  Darjamelirac.com.
[01:07:21.936 --> 01:07:23.098]  It's his daily blog.
[01:07:23.903 --> 01:07:31.885]  Tell you what's going on inside Iraq and give you the truth without the spin, without the propaganda, without the psychological operations and warfare.
[01:07:32.125 --> 01:07:33.346]  Dar, thanks again for being with us.
[01:07:33.406 --> 01:07:36.666]  I know you don't have a lot of time, so I want to cover a lot of issues.
[01:07:37.547 --> 01:07:45.969]  Obviously, one of the biggest stories coming out of Iraq this week were the two soldiers who were killed, tortured, and left in a booby-trapped field somewhere.
[01:07:46.769 --> 01:07:49.731]  And instantly we had Zakawi Jr.
[01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:50.912]  taking credit for this.
[01:07:51.432 --> 01:07:58.356]  But again, it didn't really fit with our common sense, because as we understand the Muslim religion, they don't torture the dead.
[01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:08.102]  These people were, according to the news, and who believes them, the captors wore Iraqi police uniforms.
[01:08:08.162 --> 01:08:09.683]  What information do you have on this?
[01:08:09.723 --> 01:08:10.864]  What really happened with this?
[01:08:11.927 --> 01:08:33.495]  Well, you really covered the basics, and I think, to me, the part that I follow the story the closest, and what you touched on also, is now we have another big bad boogeyman to replace Zarqali, which, you know, I just want to remind people some interesting information I've had from my colleagues over at Al Jazeera who have connections within Jordanian intelligence.
[01:08:33.955 --> 01:08:34.996]  We're good to go.
[01:08:54.431 --> 01:09:02.513]  So when someone like this shows you a picture and promises you, gives you their word that this individual is the person that they say it is, why should we believe them?
[01:09:02.573 --> 01:09:10.435]  And in that same line, why should we believe them that now they're saying, oh, there's another terrorist mastermind stepping in to fill the shoes of Zarqali?
[01:09:11.275 --> 01:09:17.917]  Zarqali, an individual who they claimed was a leader of the Iraqi resistance, they're going out of their way to connect him with
[01:09:18.537 --> 01:09:18.577]  Uh...
[01:09:48.657 --> 01:09:59.966]  And it's just an interesting thing to watch them continue to make links between terrorism and the legitimate Iraqi resistance, and terrorism in Iraq having links with 9-11.
[01:10:00.006 --> 01:10:03.068]  It's just, it's absurd, but we continue to watch them do this.
[01:10:03.128 --> 01:10:06.211]  You are actually heading out to Damascus pretty soon.
[01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:08.092]  I hope I wasn't supposed to say that on the show.
[01:10:09.213 --> 01:10:10.274]  Oh, it's okay.
[01:10:10.934 --> 01:10:14.037]  I gotta be careful sometimes, but you're heading to Syria, is that right?
[01:10:14.637 --> 01:10:15.177]  That's correct.
[01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.019]  And what are you going to be covering there, Dar?
[01:10:18.477 --> 01:10:22.139]  I mainly want to go try to humanize the situation.
[01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:42.033]  I just want to show that this is a country with people trying to live their lives because if you watch the corporate media, and even really there hasn't been much coverage of this in alternative media either, but if you look all you hear about is Syria and the government and
[01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:52.559]  The President and this sort of thing, and these accusations being hurled at them from people like Rumsfeld, that they have something to do with the resistance movement in Iraq and this sort of thing.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.301]  And I want to go try to put a human face on the situation.
[01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:57.803]  For you, because they portray all these people like animals.
[01:10:57.843 --> 01:11:03.887]  What they forget to tell us is that people, particularly in Iran, are wearing Levi's and watching Seinfeld.
[01:11:03.987 --> 01:11:04.447]  I mean, look.
[01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:08.810]  They're not a bunch of raging, flag-burning terrorists.
[01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:20.680]  In fact, if we'd have just left them alone and given them a little encouragement, I don't think there's any doubt that they might have eventually come around and joined the world in some kind of a peaceful future.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.703]  I agree with you completely, and that's exactly what I want to try to show.
[01:11:25.717 --> 01:11:28.598]  You know, you gotta hand it to him though, don't you Dar?
[01:11:28.938 --> 01:11:29.578]  In some levels.
[01:11:29.678 --> 01:11:30.538]  It's pretty smart.
[01:11:30.738 --> 01:11:33.259]  You know, in 1984 we had Emanuel Goldstein.
[01:11:33.299 --> 01:11:34.779]  He's the guy you can never catch.
[01:11:34.819 --> 01:11:41.380]  He's always the boogeyman, and of course that is the role that Osama Bin Laden has filled, who's on ice or in a shallow grave somewhere, no doubt.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:54.903]  But it's a pretty good plan to build up a guy every year or two, blame all this sectarian violence on him, blame all of these terrorist acts on him, and then go get him and capture him and stand on his body with your foot on his chest.
[01:11:55.751 --> 01:12:07.321]  Well, you're exactly right, and I love that you made the parallel to Emanuel Goldstein in 1984, because that's exactly what it is, and we've already had a few Emanuel Goldsteins in this administration.
[01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:14.567]  We still have, of course, the Emanuel Goldstein Sr., bin Laden, lurking somewhere in the shadows, and then we had Zarqawi.
[01:12:14.887 --> 01:12:16.949]  Well, they've milked that one for several years.
[01:12:17.789 --> 01:12:20.331]  Uh, and then now we have the Zarqawi Jr.
[01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.412]  So, you know, who's it going to be next?
[01:12:22.512 --> 01:12:35.759]  And it's really irrelevant, because the bottom line is, they're all the same person, they're all this, this thing that we're supposed to be afraid of, and they'll just hold them up when approval ratings are really going down into the toilet, and it does work pretty effectively for the masses.
[01:12:36.259 --> 01:12:52.364]  I saw a former cocaine smuggler and money launderer and arms dealer all over North sitting in for Sean Hannity on Fox News last night and he's trying to tell the people of Fox News, you know, you get what you pay for as I like to say, that the people of Iraq really do want us there.
[01:12:52.424 --> 01:12:59.447]  They really think we are helping them and really there are a lot of people throwing flowers at our combat boots there in Iraq.
[01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:00.787]  I'd like you to comment on that.
[01:13:01.107 --> 01:13:12.645]  And also, this state of emergency which expands the curfews, which again goes on a massive gun confiscation, also the amnesty that's now being offered to these quote-unquote terrorists.
[01:13:12.685 --> 01:13:13.967]  You can comment on any of that, Gar.
[01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:39.325]  Well, I think it's really important to talk about this state of emergency in Baghdad because I actually woke up this morning and saw that on the news and then simultaneously received an email from one of my contacts in Baghdad who said that there's a lot of talk about a coup, basically an overthrow by the resistance of the government in Baghdad, that the government is
[01:13:39.805 --> 01:13:44.450]  Worried enough and concerned enough about an all-out assault against the Green Zone.
[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:47.733]  That's why this state of emergency came into play.
[01:13:48.133 --> 01:14:01.406]  And to further underscore it, a high-ranking official in the puppet government came out immediately and denied that there was a state of emergency, despite the fact that they imposed a curfew, a middle-of-the-day curfew, from 11 a.m.
[01:14:01.466 --> 01:14:01.826]  to 3 p.m.
[01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:17.442]  It's a knee-jerk response to try to lock down the capital city because they're very afraid that there would be a successful coup and a government more representative of the people would be injected in Baghdad to overthrow these corrupt politicians.
[01:14:17.462 --> 01:14:24.769]  Is the coalition in reality in danger of losing Baghdad, Basra, Tikrit, any of these key oil areas?
[01:14:25.743 --> 01:14:32.645]  Well, that's a really important question, and I think it's important that people understand that they've essentially lost it.
[01:14:33.346 --> 01:14:37.967]  They have flimsy control of the Green Zone in Baghdad, and that's about it.
[01:14:37.987 --> 01:14:40.348]  There is no control of Basra at this point.
[01:14:40.468 --> 01:14:46.330]  Basra, where another car bomb today exploded and killed ten people and wounded about four times that many.
[01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:52.112]  Pick a city, and really, outside of the Green Zone of Baghdad, they just don't have control.
[01:14:53.362 --> 01:15:00.289]  Should we be encouraged that we're not losing a lot of American troops, though obviously a lot of Iraqis are getting killed through all of this?
[01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:05.595]  Should we be encouraged to that, or is that telling us something that again, a lot of this is pointing to P2OG?
[01:15:07.654 --> 01:15:11.859]  Well, we really are looking at... That's not good publicity, by the way.
[01:15:12.059 --> 01:15:25.216]  You've got to stop killing the soldiers, so somehow, you know, other than these two poor souls who gave their lives for their country last week, I mean, that's obviously not very good publicity, though no one in America is likely to care about innocent Iraqis being killed.
[01:15:26.056 --> 01:15:26.676]  It is true.
[01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:27.537]  That's very true.
[01:15:27.597 --> 01:15:31.758]  And I think they've gone to great lengths to minimize the number of U.S.
[01:15:31.798 --> 01:15:32.198]  soldiers.
[01:15:32.258 --> 01:15:35.840]  Not because anyone in this administration gives a damn about U.S.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.561]  soldiers, but because it's just bad for bad politics.
[01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:39.541]  It's bad for the polls.
[01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:44.863]  And so, we do see a giant number of Iraqi security forces being killed.
[01:15:44.903 --> 01:15:48.464]  If you look at the fact that, on average, there's two and a half U.S.
[01:15:48.504 --> 01:15:49.945]  soldiers being killed nowadays,
[01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:54.266]  At least ten times that number of Iraqi security forces are being killed.
[01:15:54.666 --> 01:16:04.269]  But it really just shows this policy they're trying to put the Iraqis out there to bear the brunt of the violence and hide behind their ever-growing blast walls and suicide car bomb walls.
[01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:17.192]  And it's a failed policy because even right now they're scared enough in Baghdad that they want to try to lock down the entire city with a daytime curfew and it is in an emergency state and it's still not stopping the resistance.
[01:16:17.819 --> 01:16:22.342]  What about the amnesty that is offered technically to a lot of the insurgents?
[01:16:22.362 --> 01:16:25.364]  I mean, this has been tried before, nothing ever comes of it.
[01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:35.972]  This is a veiled attempt at showing we're trying to use diplomacy, or would you say that the backs are to the wall, they're desperate, they're trying anything they can to try to quell some of the insurgency?
[01:16:36.915 --> 01:16:41.237]  Well, it's both, and I'm glad you brought that up, that this is not the first time they've done this.
[01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:44.378]  They've tried this, actually, even well over a year ago.
[01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:45.978]  They tried this very same tactic.
[01:16:46.058 --> 01:16:46.999]  Of course, the U.S.
[01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:51.300]  denied it at the time, but they are that desperate, and they have been that desperate.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:59.563]  And so they are trying to pull this out and offer this amnesty, and it's simply not going to work, because the resistance movement cannot be bought off.
[01:16:59.603 --> 01:17:00.904]  They cannot be bribed.
[01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:01.944]  Their goal is to
[01:17:02.444 --> 01:17:04.125]  Not have their country occupied.
[01:17:04.205 --> 01:17:06.987]  And just like if anyone invaded the U.S.
[01:17:07.047 --> 01:17:12.892]  and set up some puppet government that was trying to control all of us, you're not going to stop the people from resisting that.
[01:17:13.872 --> 01:17:15.133]  Not until it simply leaves.
[01:17:15.233 --> 01:17:19.737]  Because it's illegal and it's a violation of international law and nobody here can tolerate that.
[01:17:19.757 --> 01:17:21.398]  And that's exactly what's happening in Iraq.
[01:17:21.974 --> 01:17:23.415]  We're going to go to your calls in the next segment.
[01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:26.077]  We've got Dar for about another 12 minutes, I believe.
[01:17:26.478 --> 01:17:29.500]  Because all of this leads up to the big question, Dar.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:39.308]  Are there any insurgents in Iraq that aren't controlled by global intelligence services, whether it be the Mossad, MI6, SAS, the CIA, what have you?
[01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:41.598]  Well, without a doubt, actually.
[01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:46.621]  There is a grassroots, homegrown resistance movement.
[01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:57.987]  Of course, it gets very blurry when you start talking about which group is with which, and who's getting backing from whom, because it's without a doubt a very big, complicated suit.
[01:17:58.967 --> 01:18:09.374]  Without a doubt, I think the brunt of the resistance is homegrown and legitimate, and they're simply fighting because they don't want their country to be occupied.
[01:18:09.474 --> 01:18:19.061]  But, simultaneously, as you said, without a doubt, there's plenty of black ops, plenty of bombs being planted by foreign countries, and this sort of thing.
[01:18:19.121 --> 01:18:20.402]  Well, the fact of the matter is,
[01:18:21.102 --> 01:18:27.668]  Even if you don't directly control them, you can be responsible for it by funding them or letting loose a lot of people.
[01:18:27.708 --> 01:18:31.172]  At that point, it does kind of spin out of control, but that's what you wanted.
[01:18:31.212 --> 01:18:37.097]  You wanted that chaos and the repercussions of which even the controllers sometimes don't know.
[01:18:37.117 --> 01:18:39.139]  I think that's the point that we wanted to make here.
[01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:40.520]  Dar, stay with me through this break.

[01:23:10.214 --> 01:23:11.476]  Always good to talk to you, Dar.
[01:23:11.496 --> 01:23:12.757]  You're doing some great work, man.
[01:23:12.797 --> 01:23:15.681]  People are really picking up on your work and getting it all over the place.
[01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:20.402]  Every time I turn around, you're somewhere else and someone else is talking about Dar Jamal.
[01:23:20.422 --> 01:23:25.883]  So, I appreciate that and it's good to see unembedded reporters getting the real news out, Dar.
[01:23:26.123 --> 01:23:26.884]  My hat's off to you.
[01:23:27.464 --> 01:23:29.764]  Well, thanks a lot and I really appreciate your support.
[01:23:30.224 --> 01:23:30.665]  You got it.
[01:23:30.865 --> 01:23:31.405]  All the way.
[01:23:31.585 --> 01:23:35.546]  Let's go to the phones, Dar, and we'll take a few calls for you in the remaining moments you have with us.
[01:23:35.566 --> 01:23:35.806]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:37.086 --> 01:23:38.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:38.907 --> 01:23:40.687]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex today.
[01:23:40.927 --> 01:23:42.748]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:23:42.808 --> 01:23:44.208]  Chris, you're up with Dar Jamal.
[01:23:46.359 --> 01:23:47.160]  Thank you very much.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.362]  I wanted to ask your guest a question.
[01:23:50.563 --> 01:23:55.927]  I heard that 70% are getting very disgruntled with this war in Iraq and want to get out of it.
[01:23:57.106 --> 01:23:57.646]  That's correct.
[01:23:57.686 --> 01:24:05.010]  The latest poll conducted of soldiers in Iraq found that 72% wanted the occupation over within a year.
[01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:07.171]  And that poll was conducted several months ago.
[01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:10.593]  So, yeah, morale has been very low for quite some time.
[01:24:10.733 --> 01:24:13.274]  Even a year ago, the U.S.
[01:24:13.334 --> 01:24:20.177]  Army conducted its own survey and found that 56% of all the units in Iraq reported either low or very low morale.
[01:24:20.217 --> 01:24:26.000]  And the other 30% are either contractors or they're there to fight for their buddies and, you know, just there to protect
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:32.143]  The people that are already there doing their duty to, again, fight a war to get the heck out of there and that's about it.
[01:24:33.364 --> 01:24:36.845]  But, you know, that's true and there's been a lot of suicides, there's been a lot of defections.
[01:24:36.865 --> 01:24:40.247]  We got people here in this country, Dar, that just refuse to flat out go now.
[01:24:40.267 --> 01:24:44.169]  A lot of people are refusing to even pay their taxes to support this phony war.
[01:24:44.847 --> 01:24:47.248]  That's right, and there were more suicides last year in Iraq.
[01:24:47.988 --> 01:24:49.888]  It's been the highest year yet for U.S.
[01:24:49.908 --> 01:24:50.268]  soldiers.
[01:24:50.328 --> 01:24:58.870]  And let's not forget also, because you are a reporter and you're going back there, there have been more reporters killed in the Iraq War than, I believe, World War II.
[01:24:59.130 --> 01:25:00.371]  Are we up to that number yet?
[01:25:00.811 --> 01:25:01.651]  That is correct.
[01:25:01.731 --> 01:25:05.892]  It has surpassed the number killed in World War I, World War II, and in Vietnam.
[01:25:06.492 --> 01:25:07.072]  Amazing.
[01:25:07.412 --> 01:25:08.333]  Chris, thanks for the call.
[01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:08.893]  Appreciate it.
[01:25:08.933 --> 01:25:10.333]  Let's go to Scott in California.
[01:25:10.373 --> 01:25:12.073]  Scott, you're on the air with Darjeel.
[01:25:13.054 --> 01:25:13.274]  Hello?
[01:25:13.694 --> 01:25:14.414]  Yes, you're on the air, sir.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:18.842]  Hey, I'm just calling to give you a field report of my contribution against the NWO.
[01:25:18.862 --> 01:25:20.903]  Okay.
[01:25:20.923 --> 01:25:22.064]  I recently went to Europe.
[01:25:22.104 --> 01:25:25.446]  I went to Amsterdam, I went to Prague, and then I went to Hamburg.
[01:25:25.906 --> 01:25:33.250]  And I've passed out as many copies of of uh, and also marched a lot as I possibly could.
[01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:42.675]  And I'm going to tell you, over there, it doesn't take any effort to convince people, Bush administration's behind 9-11, it doesn't take any effort to convince anybody about the
[01:25:43.584 --> 01:25:44.664]  New World Order.
[01:25:44.944 --> 01:25:46.065]  They're pretty much aware of it.
[01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:51.886]  And if you can get anybody to go over there and start distributing these, they're a lot more receptive than Americans are.
[01:25:52.066 --> 01:25:55.046]  I've got to tell you, we've got a lot of listeners out that way, believe it or not.
[01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:57.567]  I've got letters from all around the world, Scott.
[01:25:57.587 --> 01:26:00.608]  So we know that people are listening to this global transmission.
[01:26:00.628 --> 01:26:01.908]  They're listening to DAR today.
[01:26:02.388 --> 01:26:07.209]  They heard the analysis earlier of Alex Jones of these homegrown, phony FBI sting terror attacks.
[01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:14.452]  They get to hear it all, and look, whatever we can do, obviously we're going to do, because I'm concerned about my country.
[01:26:14.532 --> 01:26:15.352]  I live in this country.
[01:26:15.392 --> 01:26:28.798]  We should all be fighting for our own country, our own sovereignty, our own individualism, getting government out of our lives, teaching people to not trust government and put their faith in government, but I'm glad to see that the message is carrying around the world.
[01:26:28.818 --> 01:26:31.779]  We all need to make a stand in our individual countries.
[01:26:31.799 --> 01:26:32.960]  Dara, you want to comment on that at all?
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.763]  No, I just, I support you completely.
[01:26:35.843 --> 01:26:41.109]  I think if, I don't know if anyone's still on the fence and not deciding to take that stand or join in.
[01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:43.352]  I don't hate my country, Dar.
[01:26:43.412 --> 01:26:44.733]  I love my country.
[01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:46.055]  I do support the troops.
[01:26:46.075 --> 01:26:49.419]  That's why I don't want to see them going and getting DU'd and killed over in Iraq.
[01:26:50.319 --> 01:26:52.280]  And we hear it's for oil.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.480]  Well, it is for oil.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:57.742]  It's for keeping the oil in the ground and controlling the global petrodollar.
[01:26:57.782 --> 01:26:59.502]  And that's a lot of what this is about.
[01:26:59.542 --> 01:27:03.804]  And Greg Palacios wrote about this very prolifically in his book, Armed Madhouse.
[01:27:03.884 --> 01:27:06.785]  And I think we're now beginning to get the picture.
[01:27:06.945 --> 01:27:10.086]  John, in New Jersey, you're last up with Dar Jamal.
[01:27:10.106 --> 01:27:10.546]  Go for it.
[01:27:11.087 --> 01:27:13.707]  Yes, I really appreciate Dar Jamal.
[01:27:13.747 --> 01:27:17.909]  I read some of his articles on cmag.org, cmag.org.
[01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:23.534]  And it's amazing to me that there's so few that are willing to tell the truth.
[01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:42.430]  It seems the whole premise of the corporate media is to simply invite all of the proven liars on, the official Pentagon, White House liars on, the fake experts connected to the CIA and the Pentagon to scare the hell out of us over phony terrorist attacks.
[01:27:43.032 --> 01:27:52.116]  And then just sit there and wrap attention and thank them profusely for enlightening us with their disinformation and their propaganda and their lies.
[01:27:53.317 --> 01:27:56.879]  While they're rewarded millions of dollars a year to be the shills for the New World Order.
[01:27:57.079 --> 01:27:58.239]  That's what it's all about.
[01:27:58.379 --> 01:28:00.440]  And I read in one of D.A.R.'
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:07.023]  's articles, I don't know if you've mentioned it, but that they're in effect engaging in... Are you there?
[01:28:07.043 --> 01:28:07.484]  Yeah.
[01:28:08.979 --> 01:28:09.419]  Are you there?
[01:28:09.519 --> 01:28:11.881]  Go ahead, you're on.
[01:28:12.121 --> 01:28:13.282]  But we ran out of gas.
[01:28:13.482 --> 01:28:15.964]  We ran out of time.
[01:28:16.545 --> 01:28:19.067]  John, I'm going to keep you over if you want to stay over.
[01:28:19.087 --> 01:28:21.048]  We're going to play this clip of Jim Fetzer coming up.
[01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:22.629]  Dar, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:23.450]  Have a safe trip.
[01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:24.451]  Keep in touch with us.
[01:28:24.491 --> 01:28:25.371]  Keep us in the loop, folks.
[01:28:25.632 --> 01:28:27.213]  DarJamalIraq.com.
[01:28:27.233 --> 01:28:27.673]  Thanks, Dar.
[01:28:28.274 --> 01:28:28.574]  Thank you.
[01:28:40.908 --> 01:28:43.911]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.832 --> 01:28:47.635]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:54.522]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:54.722 --> 01:28:58.125]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:28:58.306 --> 01:29:01.709]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:02.017 --> 01:29:05.280]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:10.764]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:20.431]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:29:20.572 --> 01:29:21.913]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:29:21.933 --> 01:29:27.357]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:32.280]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.

[01:29:50.692 --> 01:29:55.914]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:56.054 --> 01:30:04.136]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:04.396 --> 01:30:11.438]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:11.578 --> 01:30:12.559]  We're good to go!
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:33.640]  I think so.
[01:30:51.627 --> 01:30:54.188]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:56.509]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:32:09.474 --> 01:32:13.888]  Well, thankfully we have people like Darja Mel out there, Chris Albritton, who have
[01:32:14.551 --> 01:32:23.577]  Literally, when you hear the stories of these guys, they don't just fly into Baghdad airport usually and give their press credentials and then just get to go wherever they want.
[01:32:23.617 --> 01:32:35.364]  They generally have to be smuggled over the border through Turkey or Syria with mules who they have to pay and climb through treacherous mountains and territories and they're really risking their lives at all times.
[01:32:35.424 --> 01:32:42.849]  Not being embedded, they are not only targets for potential insurgents or terrorists, but they're also targets
[01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:44.971]  By our own people, our own military.
[01:32:46.492 --> 01:32:49.996]  So, I mean, I don't know what more they could do, obviously.
[01:32:50.036 --> 01:32:53.960]  They're risking their lives to get us this news, and not being paid for it.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.685]  So if you get a chance to support these people, make sure that you do it, so we can continue to get this news and
[01:32:59.748 --> 01:33:02.551]  I just can't believe what these guys go through to get this.
[01:33:02.611 --> 01:33:04.753]  I mean, I think my job is hard sometimes.
[01:33:04.773 --> 01:33:17.986]  Some of the things I have to do, and it definitely scares my family a little bit, and some of the people around me, just because we attract so much attention, and we go at these people so hard, you know, hammering the FBI, hammering the government.
[01:33:18.984 --> 01:33:29.328]  You know, that it gets a little concerning sometimes, but it's nothing like going to Iraq and putting a big bullseye on your forehead to try to get people like us the news.
[01:33:29.788 --> 01:33:31.128]  They should really be commended.
[01:33:31.188 --> 01:33:33.469]  They are modern-day heroes, okay?
[01:33:34.256 --> 01:33:35.237]  I want to play this clip.
[01:33:35.257 --> 01:33:36.798]  Last night, I'm sure most of you saw that.
[01:33:36.818 --> 01:33:41.861]  If you didn't, you don't really need to see the video so much, but the audio is really important.
[01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:46.204]  Last night, Jim Fetzer made an appearance on the Hannity and Combs Show.
[01:33:46.224 --> 01:33:46.964]  Hannity was out.
[01:33:47.284 --> 01:33:51.387]  Kerner, Oliver North, war criminal, former drug smuggler, money launderer.
[01:33:52.108 --> 01:33:56.250]  The gentleman who put together this plan for the Civilian Inmate Labor Program.
[01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:57.671]  That's right, detention camps.
[01:33:58.251 --> 01:33:59.032]  Armed smuggler.
[01:34:00.018 --> 01:34:03.300]  Criminal from Iran-Contra, sitting in for Sean Hannity.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.081]  That's fitting.
[01:34:04.461 --> 01:34:06.442]  And I thought Jim Fetzer did a pretty good job, though.
[01:34:06.622 --> 01:34:10.125]  They were really trying to derail him, and it seemed at the end they just cut him right off.
[01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:17.670]  I mean, he was really starting to put out some good evidence, and it looked to me like he thought he had more time than he did, because the interview ended very abruptly.
[01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:19.030]  But I want to play that for you now.
[01:34:19.050 --> 01:34:23.874]  We'll come back, take some more phone calls, and get your comments on that, or obviously anything else you want to talk about.
[01:34:24.474 --> 01:34:25.775]  John, go ahead and roll that clip for us.
[01:34:26.896 --> 01:34:29.797]  ...on to the campuses of some major American universities.
[01:34:29.837 --> 01:34:37.042]  Joining us now, the co-chairman of Scholars for 9-11 Truth, Professor Emeritus at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, James Fetzer.
[01:34:37.102 --> 01:34:38.523]  Professor, thank you so much for being with us.
[01:34:38.783 --> 01:34:40.604]  First of all, is this a required course?
[01:34:43.385 --> 01:34:43.846]  Can you hear me?
[01:34:44.326 --> 01:34:44.886]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:34:44.926 --> 01:34:45.767]  Is it a required course?
[01:34:47.212 --> 01:34:49.994]  Well, you got your facts foxed, I'm sorry to say.
[01:34:50.054 --> 01:34:56.657]  In fact, I created an organization of faculty and experts to study 9-11, not to teach in courses.
[01:34:57.017 --> 01:35:04.361]  But I must tell you what we have discovered... Well, I just want to be clear because... ...certainly qualify as material for an important course... So you're saying you're not teaching this?
[01:35:04.601 --> 01:35:05.461]  I want to be clear here.
[01:35:05.761 --> 01:35:06.982]  You're not teaching a course in this.
[01:35:07.342 --> 01:35:13.085]  No, you're confused, and I hope that Fox usually does a better job on their research than this.
[01:35:13.225 --> 01:35:22.751]  I created an organization of faculty and scholars to study 9-11, and we discovered that practically everything the government has told us about it is false.
[01:35:22.811 --> 01:35:24.532]  I want to get into that in a moment, I just want to be clear.
[01:35:24.992 --> 01:35:32.056]  As far as you know, there is no course on 9-11 conspiracy theories being taught at your university or any place else that you know of?
[01:35:32.802 --> 01:35:34.323]  That's right, but it's a great idea.
[01:35:34.423 --> 01:35:38.427]  I would certainly support having such a course because there's a lot of material to work with.
[01:35:38.447 --> 01:35:47.735]  Alright, and what evidence do you have that the government was involved, that Cheney knew, that anybody in the Cheney command knew ahead of time that this was going to happen on 9-11?
[01:35:48.015 --> 01:35:52.079]  Can you give us any piece of evidence that would substantiate that argument?
[01:35:52.638 --> 01:35:53.159]  Absolutely.
[01:35:53.199 --> 01:36:04.086]  For example, Norman Mineta testified to the 9-11 Commission that he observed Dick Cheney in an underground bunker when a young aide came up to him and repeatedly told him, Sir, it's 50 miles out.
[01:36:04.126 --> 01:36:04.907]  Sir, it's 30 miles out.
[01:36:04.947 --> 01:36:05.967]  Sir, it's 10 miles out.
[01:36:06.007 --> 01:36:07.288]  Sir, do the orders still stand?
[01:36:07.648 --> 01:36:11.571]  Cheney turned around, jumped on him nearly bit off his head and said, of course the orders still stand.
[01:36:11.591 --> 01:36:12.552]  Have you heard anything different?
[01:36:12.912 --> 01:36:17.175]  The order had to be to not shoot down the plane that was approaching the Pentagon.
[01:36:17.735 --> 01:36:19.778]  After all, the order should have been to shoot it down.
[01:36:20.118 --> 01:36:32.653]  Shooting it down would be the obvious thing to do when you consider that you're going to lose the passengers in the plane if you shoot it down, but if you don't, you're going to use the passengers in the plane and also, of course, all the personnel and property at the target.
[01:36:33.113 --> 01:36:37.855]  I want to go back to something in exchange that you and Alan just had a moment ago.
[01:36:37.895 --> 01:36:47.540]  In fairness to our producers, when they talked to you earlier, you said that courses are being taught in which these conspiracy theories are advanced to the students.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.080]  Am I correct?
[01:36:48.786 --> 01:36:49.707]  No, you're not correct.
[01:36:49.767 --> 01:37:04.739]  What I said to him was, in courses on critical thinking, sometimes issues related to, for example, tax cuts, or global warming, or reasons for going to war in Iraq, might be discussed as examples, but I know of no courses as such that are being taught that way.
[01:37:04.759 --> 01:37:14.528]  So let me ask, how big is this group of professors that you've put together, this organization you've formed, that gives credence, if you will, to the theory you just advanced about 9-11?
[01:37:15.368 --> 01:37:28.277]  Well, there are over 300 members, Colonel North, including about 200 with advanced research skills, and about 85 that have affiliations, including physicists, mechanical engineers, pilots, aeronautical engineers.
[01:37:28.617 --> 01:37:31.979]  We've discovered that the Twin Towers were brought down by controlled demolition.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.863]  We've discovered that the Osama bin Laden appears to have had nothing to do with it.
[01:37:37.363 --> 01:37:37.983]  Help me out here.
[01:37:38.904 --> 01:37:43.327]  Having been involved in a couple of controversial undertakings over my years in government service,
[01:37:44.019 --> 01:37:48.549]  How many people in the government were part of this conspiracy that you envisioned?
[01:37:49.156 --> 01:37:49.556]  Hundreds?
[01:37:49.616 --> 01:37:50.176]  Thousands?
[01:37:50.917 --> 01:37:51.657]  No, no, Ollie.
[01:37:51.737 --> 01:37:52.857]  I think it's a small number.
[01:37:52.897 --> 01:37:58.619]  You know about classified, controlled operations where everything's departmentalized.
[01:37:58.819 --> 01:38:05.002]  Do you know, Ollie, that the FBI has confirmed that they have no hard evidence relating Osama bin Laden to the events of 9-11?
[01:38:05.022 --> 01:38:05.822]  Are you aware of that?
[01:38:05.982 --> 01:38:07.963]  Well, Osama bin Laden himself claims that.
[01:38:08.003 --> 01:38:09.963]  I mean, they didn't manufacture those tapes.
[01:38:09.983 --> 01:38:11.104]  This is the FBI, Ollie.
[01:38:11.184 --> 01:38:16.846]  This is the FBI that has affirmed in the last couple of weeks they have no hard evidence tying Osama bin Laden to 9-11.
[01:38:17.846 --> 01:38:24.888]  And so all of these people that died on 9-11, you're articulating, died as a consequence of what our government did.
[01:38:25.228 --> 01:38:27.428]  We're trying to find out exactly what happened.
[01:38:27.528 --> 01:38:31.829]  Our government has a considerable reputation for telling things that are not true, Ollie.
[01:38:31.849 --> 01:38:32.710]  All right, Professor.
[01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:34.410]  Thank you very much for coming on tonight.
[01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:36.550]  Coming up, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin.
[01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:37.971]  All right, that's it, folks.
[01:38:38.031 --> 01:38:46.973]  And like I said, the interview seemed to end rather abruptly, and what I would like to have heard Professor Fetzer say was that Bin Laden did not
[01:38:47.453 --> 01:38:48.734]  Confess to 9-11.
[01:38:48.774 --> 01:39:06.326]  In fact, that was a phony video, a made-up video, the Fat Bin Laden video that we generally talk about, where Bin Laden is roughly 40 to 80 pounds heavier, he has a giant fat nose, and this is Osama Bin Laden who is on kidney dialysis living in a cave.
[01:39:06.406 --> 01:39:11.450]  I'm not sure if he's just been boning up on goats and had a nose job, but barring that,
[01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:15.992]  We have no record where Osama Bin Laden confessed to 9-11.
[01:39:16.032 --> 01:39:31.060]  In fact, the actual records we do have are the opposite, where Osama Bin Laden denies 9-11, including a number of face-to-face interviews by people we've interviewed on our programs who say specifically Osama Bin Laden did not have anything to do with 9-11.
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:39.524]  And if he did, obviously we would have to look at the fact that he had been funded, trained, and brought up by the CIA in the Mujahedin.
[01:39:39.824 --> 01:39:40.445]  And of course,
[01:39:41.125 --> 01:39:42.946]  I had to get this money from somewhere.
[01:39:43.646 --> 01:40:09.036]  So look, I mean, Oliver North made an errant point, and it would have been nice to see Fetzer jump on that, but look, you put yourself in the chair, you're talking to Oliver North and Alan Combs, you're on Fox News, they're trying to move the topic along to whether or not you're teaching this in the school, because what they wanted to do was they wanted to portray Jim Fetzer as another one of these liberal professors, like Warren Churchill, who are out there teaching
[01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:14.302]  You're spreading leftist propaganda to our children and shouldn't you conservatives be outraged?
[01:40:15.302 --> 01:40:16.563]  That didn't work very good.
[01:40:17.203 --> 01:40:23.328]  And I think Fetzer did a fantastic job, and I have absolutely nothing but praise for that appearance.
[01:40:23.368 --> 01:40:26.090]  And this really proves that, you know, they used to ignore us.
[01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:27.571]  They used to malign us.
[01:40:27.731 --> 01:40:31.734]  Oh, well, that's just some conspiracy nuts on the Internet.
[01:40:31.995 --> 01:40:40.201]  And I remember when I interviewed Oliver North years ago, he tried to say, well, you must have saw this on the Internet, Jack, that I created the civilian inmate labor program.
[01:40:40.541 --> 01:40:45.851]  No, I saw the documents, and by the way, Ollie, don't you have a website that you're plugging right now?
[01:40:46.151 --> 01:40:49.457]  Should that all be considered to be worthless information?
[01:40:49.497 --> 01:40:51.401]  Well, in his case, of course, it certainly should!
[01:40:52.469 --> 01:41:22.129]  So it really tells us something that these people feel now they've got to take this on and just the fact that Jim Fetzer got out and proved that this isn't a bunch of internet hacks or conspiracy nuts but some of the top critical thinkers in this country at the best universities who are more qualified to analyze this than obviously Oliver North is or Sean Vanity is or certainly even the people in our government who hours after 9-11 blame Bin Laden.
[01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:40.461]  And let's not forget, FOIA requests were put through, the notes of Donald Rumsfeld were revealed, though somewhat redacted, and minimally what we got was, here is Donald Rumsfeld, on the ground, out on the lawn of the Pentagon, helping the poor survivors.
[01:41:42.002 --> 01:41:42.843]  May they rest in peace.
[01:41:43.792 --> 01:41:44.412]  On the day of 9-11.
[01:41:44.692 --> 01:41:55.976]  No, he wasn't monitoring or protecting the country to further attacks, because at that point they wouldn't have known, unless they were in on it, folks, they wouldn't have known that there weren't going to be any more attacks.
[01:41:56.336 --> 01:42:02.338]  So here he is, out on the lawn, helping, doing his part, and meanwhile he's giving notes to his aide.
[01:42:02.378 --> 01:42:05.619]  His aide is scribbling furiously a note to General Myers.
[01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:07.980]  And the note basically said, I'll paraphrase,
[01:42:09.154 --> 01:42:09.834]  Go after him!
[01:42:10.174 --> 01:42:10.975]  Sweep it all up!
[01:42:11.235 --> 01:42:14.815]  Find a way to blame this on Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
[01:42:15.096 --> 01:42:16.376]  True or not true?
[01:42:16.476 --> 01:42:17.336]  Sweep it all up!
[01:42:17.976 --> 01:42:24.898]  So they were already at that point, and he knew because he's in the peanut gang, they knew they were going to blame this on these guys in the first place.
[01:42:25.818 --> 01:42:28.879]  But they wanted to put that down the chain of command.
[01:42:29.477 --> 01:42:39.015]  And that's why, of course, hours later this was already blamed on Al Qaeda, and Osama Bin Laden, and eventually even Saddam Hussein, and now, of course, Iran.
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:41.441]  With absolutely no evidence.
[01:42:41.481 --> 01:42:55.636]  In fact, the evidence that I think convinced most Americans was the passport that flew out through that burning building and was found conveniently, seconds later, on the dust-filled, charred ground beneath the footprints of the World Trade Center Tower.
[01:42:55.896 --> 01:43:01.822]  That very find, which was later retracted in an international newspaper about a year later.
[01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:03.404]  Of course, you didn't hear about that.
[01:43:05.573 --> 01:43:05.633]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:43:06.374 --> 01:43:08.495]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:08.775 --> 01:43:11.738]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:43:12.078 --> 01:43:13.279]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:43:13.319 --> 01:43:17.722]  John, I'm sorry that I cut you off, and if you're still there, I wanted to give you a chance to finish up.
[01:43:18.303 --> 01:43:31.233]  Yeah, I just, in my compliments to our guy Jamal, I think I read in one of his articles, I'm sure I read this, but it's one of the unabated reporters, that they're actually using Nazi collective punishment tactics in Ramadi,
[01:43:31.801 --> 01:43:42.246]  And that they've in advance said that if you don't turn over the insurgents, you will get no telephone service, water, medical service, or any other kind of service.
[01:43:42.366 --> 01:43:50.009]  And then the insurgents on the other side say if you cooperate at all with the Iraqi government, the illegal, illegitimate government, or the occupiers, we'll kill you.
[01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:56.612]  Yeah, I mean, this shows the real tenor and nature of this brutal Nazi invasion over there.
[01:43:56.652 --> 01:43:59.874]  I mean, the premise of all the media
[01:44:00.379 --> 01:44:12.386]  Yeah, you're allowed to criticize Bush, Cheney, and company for being too concerned about bringing democracy there, or just being concerned or being too concerned.
[01:44:13.606 --> 01:44:18.049]  If you start with that garbage in, garbage out lie, everything else completely falls.
[01:44:18.089 --> 01:44:18.629]  That's right.
[01:44:18.929 --> 01:44:27.194]  And the only purpose of it is to actually destroy sovereignty and self-determination over there, as you said, to grab that oil as a hammer, a weapon of war.
[01:44:27.862 --> 01:44:47.016]  I guess the rest of the world... That's what James Traficant said in his speech before they framed him and locked him up in his speech which is on the public record, congressional record, is that we went bankrupt after World War II and they would use quote-unquote democracy to eliminate the sovereignty of everybody in this country and around the world and thanks for the call, John.
[01:44:47.036 --> 01:44:50.659]  I also want to put this on the record because something we really have to understand.
[01:44:51.199 --> 01:45:02.667]  If you do nothing else, and you talk to one of the mind-controlled Stepford Republicans locked into groupthink out there, one thing you're going to really have to get through to people is, this is war.
[01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:05.709]  There is no nice way to fight a war.
[01:45:05.929 --> 01:45:14.234]  There's psychological operations, there's intimidation, there's torture, there's napalm, there's all of this.
[01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:17.997]  This is what war is, especially modern warfare.
[01:45:18.573 --> 01:45:20.354]  But you can go back thousands of years.
[01:45:20.594 --> 01:45:22.214]  This is how wars are fought.
[01:45:22.554 --> 01:45:30.777]  And if we don't understand that before we send our troops to war, we're going to have to sit and wonder, why is all this happening?
[01:45:31.537 --> 01:45:33.218]  And it's all happening because this is war.
[01:45:33.418 --> 01:45:43.661]  The next time they try to sell you a war, you better understand that everything that's going on in Iraq right now, everything that's going on in Afghanistan right now, everything that happened in Vietnam will happen again.
[01:45:43.962 --> 01:45:45.862]  There's no nice way to fight a war.
[01:45:47.023 --> 01:45:48.043]  We better understand that.
[01:45:48.843 --> 01:45:57.495]  And that's why going to war on phony pretexts should be... I mean people should really be held responsible for that in the highest way.
[01:45:57.675 --> 01:46:00.619]  I mean literally prosecuted for war crimes and treason.
[01:46:01.593 --> 01:46:19.883]  Because you only go to war when you absolutely have to, to protect your country, to protect your way of life, to protect the sovereignty of your people, and not on a phony pretext, but when you absolutely have to, not preemptively, like we're thinking about doing in North Korea right now, which we're just about to do in Iran right now, or Syria.
[01:46:20.303 --> 01:46:26.187]  And by the way, if you're in Saudi Arabia, or if you know someone who is listening to this show, I've seen the white papers, they're going after you!
[01:46:26.487 --> 01:46:28.628]  If you live in Egypt, they're going after you!
[01:46:29.168 --> 01:46:30.429]  They've already talked about this!
[01:46:30.809 --> 01:46:32.070]  You're not safe!
[01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:38.774]  I don't care how many kisses on the lips King Fahd gets from George W. Bush, you're not safe either.
[01:46:39.335 --> 01:46:40.616]  No one is safe!
[01:46:41.296 --> 01:46:43.437]  And no wars can be fought politely.
[01:46:43.637 --> 01:46:44.718]  You better understand that.
[01:46:44.738 --> 01:46:46.319]  Let's go to Fred in Philly.
[01:46:46.339 --> 01:46:47.280]  Fred, thank you for holding.
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:48.461]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:49.081 --> 01:46:49.521]  Hi Jack.
[01:46:49.942 --> 01:46:55.105]  I want to say that the questioning that Jim had was of this type.
[01:46:56.436 --> 01:47:02.254]  They'll say, is it true or not true that there is a course on leprechauns being held at your university?
[01:47:03.568 --> 01:47:04.849]  That's the type of questioning.
[01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:06.151]  Well, this is what they always do.
[01:47:06.191 --> 01:47:12.336]  They try to turn things into a left versus right, liberal versus conservative debate.
[01:47:12.596 --> 01:47:14.058]  And Jim just didn't fall for it.
[01:47:14.118 --> 01:47:16.720]  Now, maybe... Look, they kept bringing it up.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.922]  That's the thing that really upset me is Oliver North.
[01:47:18.942 --> 01:47:20.043]  They'd already settled this.
[01:47:20.383 --> 01:47:25.328]  Oliver North brings it all back up again because it wastes time and he can't get out more evidence.
[01:47:25.508 --> 01:47:25.668]  Yeah.
[01:47:26.238 --> 01:47:27.800]  Now, I want to talk about the Iraq War.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.142]  I've got several points here.
[01:47:30.442 --> 01:47:32.784]  Most reporters killed more than World War II.
[01:47:33.325 --> 01:47:36.668]  Highest cost in people and material probably of any war.
[01:47:37.128 --> 01:47:47.978]  And there's about a 3,000 to 1 ratio of what the guerrillas have to spend for, you know, the little dinky little equipment they have and what the coalition has to spend.
[01:47:48.419 --> 01:47:51.902]  Number three, longest time of a war, if you want to count,
[01:47:53.111 --> 01:47:53.892]  Let's say September 1990.
[01:47:53.992 --> 01:47:56.633]  I'm talking about the whole Middle East conflict.
[01:47:57.174 --> 01:47:57.974]  Because it really didn't end.
[01:47:57.994 --> 01:48:00.356]  Yeah, you're going to have to go back to the 50s for that, sure.
[01:48:00.396 --> 01:48:02.517]  Yeah, to 2010, let's say.
[01:48:02.597 --> 01:48:05.719]  Maybe when this finally reaches its finalment.
[01:48:06.259 --> 01:48:09.801]  You have the phenomenon of off-book spending.
[01:48:09.821 --> 01:48:11.902]  You have an out-of-control spending.
[01:48:12.263 --> 01:48:13.463]  The lack of controls.
[01:48:14.064 --> 01:48:16.385]  Loss of liberty at home and no legality.
[01:48:17.206 --> 01:48:21.088]  Number five, you have fax being a huge casualty in the war.
[01:48:22.277 --> 01:48:27.981]  I had heard that there were 137 Iraqis murdered in custody in Iraqi jails.
[01:48:28.481 --> 01:48:30.243]  All the jails, not just Abu Ghraib.
[01:48:30.263 --> 01:48:32.545]  There's so many jails that are classified.
[01:48:32.625 --> 01:48:33.826]  You don't know where they are.
[01:48:33.866 --> 01:48:35.387]  You don't know who runs them.
[01:48:35.467 --> 01:48:37.148]  And not just in Iraq, as everybody knows.
[01:48:37.349 --> 01:48:37.589]  Right.
[01:48:38.509 --> 01:48:40.291]  Iraqi civilians killed and wounded.
[01:48:41.092 --> 01:48:43.373]  What about the numbers there?
[01:48:43.393 --> 01:48:44.814]  The press isn't telling us that.
[01:48:45.235 --> 01:48:46.796]  Torture, they're not telling us that.
[01:48:47.136 --> 01:48:48.157]  The whole story of that.
[01:48:48.197 --> 01:48:48.998]  What about weapons?
[01:48:49.423 --> 01:48:49.843]  Red!
[01:48:50.064 --> 01:48:50.244]  Red!
[01:48:50.264 --> 01:48:51.905]  We've got to stay the course!
[01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:53.666]  Red, we've got to stay the course!
[01:48:54.247 --> 01:49:03.053]  I heard there was a small nuke being used in Fallujah or something that was... Sure, and that's a proven fact.
[01:49:03.093 --> 01:49:07.036]  Juliana Segrina reported that and her bodyguard was killed trying to get that evidence back to Italy.
[01:49:07.376 --> 01:49:15.542]  So what's going to happen is that the leaders are so guilty they're going to continue this policy until they're
[01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:17.471]  Until they're kicked out.
[01:49:17.731 --> 01:49:26.017]  Look, I know all these facts, you know the facts, and I think a good majority of our listeners who have been listening to this program for any amount of time know all of these facts.
[01:49:26.078 --> 01:49:39.508]  Yet, here we have again, middle America, I guess, and I hate to point to you guys, because there certainly are a lot of robot radicals on both of the coasts, but they still think that getting Zakawi is a victory!
[01:49:39.868 --> 01:49:42.951]  Uncovering these terrorist plots every other day is a victory!
[01:49:45.049 --> 01:49:46.350]  We'll come right back after this, folks.
[01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.631]  Stay tuned.
[01:49:46.651 --> 01:49:50.134]  This is the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network, Infowars.com.
[01:49:51.676 --> 01:49:54.538]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:54.799 --> 01:49:55.479]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:55.579 --> 01:49:56.380]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.385]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:01.725 --> 01:50:08.472]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:08.792 --> 01:50:10.754]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:10.974 --> 01:50:13.817]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:13.897 --> 01:50:18.581]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:23.165]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:23.425 --> 01:50:30.652]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.683]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:54.723 --> 01:50:55.243]  are located?
[01:50:55.443 --> 01:50:58.825]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:51:52.125 --> 01:51:52.465]  I think so.
[01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:08.011]  We're good to go!
[01:52:36.892 --> 01:52:39.974]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:40.134 --> 01:52:45.997]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:55.766 --> 01:52:56.306]  Lee Ray!
[01:52:56.467 --> 01:52:56.987]  Lee Ray!
[01:53:11.813 --> 01:53:17.258]  We are going to go right back to your calls right after this next break, which is in just a few minutes.
[01:53:17.339 --> 01:53:21.142]  And I want to take all your calls in an open line format for the rest of the program today.
[01:53:21.523 --> 01:53:23.805]  And we're going to give you a lot of news.
[01:53:23.885 --> 01:53:25.987]  Again, you're not getting anywhere else.
[01:53:26.287 --> 01:53:27.008]  Just real quick.
[01:53:27.348 --> 01:53:30.411]  I want to remind you, Alex Jones' video is always on special.
[01:53:31.011 --> 01:53:32.072]  You need to get these videos.
[01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:38.737]  The Order of Death is the new, slick production of Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:53:38.757 --> 01:53:49.645]  It's got a lot of new footage in it, and if there's anyone out there that has any doubt that our entire society is ruled or controlled by deep occultists, then you just need to see this video.
[01:53:49.705 --> 01:53:50.406]  It's on record.
[01:53:50.926 --> 01:53:54.169]  And you know, when I interviewed Tim Russert last week, I mean, he couldn't even deny it.
[01:53:54.801 --> 01:53:55.742]  We've got the footage.
[01:53:55.782 --> 01:53:56.903]  We've got the documents.
[01:53:56.943 --> 01:53:58.284]  We've got the testimony.
[01:53:58.324 --> 01:53:59.805]  We've heard from the whistleblowers.
[01:54:00.085 --> 01:54:01.506]  This is all going on.
[01:54:01.546 --> 01:54:16.616]  These very people that profess to be Christians, or Muslims, or Jews, or what have you, are really New World Order occultists, who believe that the Sun religion and the Sun God will ultimately give them control of the entire Earth.
[01:54:16.636 --> 01:54:19.078]  And this has been going on since the beginning of time.
[01:54:19.098 --> 01:54:21.660]  And if you're so naive that you think, or someone you know is,
[01:54:22.538 --> 01:54:25.380]  You think that this just stopped about a hundred years ago?
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.721]  We really need to use some common sense.
[01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:30.343]  The order of death dictates all of this.
[01:54:30.503 --> 01:54:36.926]  Satanic secret societies that are trying to rule the world and reveals their history and their master plan.
[01:54:36.946 --> 01:54:40.208]  If you haven't seen this new cut, I went and saw it in the theater when it first came out.
[01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:41.209]  It's just amazing.
[01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:42.649]  It will really rock your world.
[01:54:42.669 --> 01:54:44.571]  888-253-3139.
[01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:50.514]  To make that call or simply go to Infowars.com, the online store, Infowars.com.
[01:54:51.074 --> 01:54:57.017]  And I don't think Alex talks about this very much, but I was just rifling through a number of the t-shirts here in the InfoWars studios.
[01:54:57.037 --> 01:55:11.144]  The Orwell t-shirts, the Arnold Exposed t-shirts, the Tyranny Response Team t-shirts, which you want to wear when you go out to protest, when you go out to get in the face of your local Congress critters, your local vampires that are in charge of your community.
[01:55:11.644 --> 01:55:13.645]  Great t-shirts, and they really get people
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:15.521]  Coming up to you.
[01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:19.546]  It's just amazing when you wear some of these shirts, especially the gun control shirt.
[01:55:19.967 --> 01:55:22.590]  People really come up to you and engage you in conversations.
[01:55:22.630 --> 01:55:31.881]  If you have trouble meeting people and getting the word out and maybe you feel a little bit intimidated to go up to people and talk to people, the t-shirts really, really work.
[01:55:31.901 --> 01:55:32.903]  So you wear the t-shirt.
[01:55:33.543 --> 01:55:41.069]  They come up, you start a conversation with people, and then you're able to give them copies of the videos that you get here from InfoWars.com.
[01:55:41.129 --> 01:55:45.053]  Also, PrisonPlanet.TV is the way you see things first.
[01:55:45.493 --> 01:55:49.136]  All of the projects Alex is working on, you'll get to see them first.
[01:55:49.156 --> 01:55:54.260]  You'll get the first sneak previews of everything Alex does at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.924]  Subscriptions are very low, literally pennies a day, and you want to subscribe to that.
[01:55:59.244 --> 01:56:02.665]  And I just wanted to say, my website is jackblood.com.
[01:56:02.705 --> 01:56:05.826]  We do daily news reports, original, exclusive reports.
[01:56:05.846 --> 01:56:12.988]  We've got a big supply of archives there that basically prove everything that we've been saying all these years.
[01:56:13.328 --> 01:56:14.969]  And I put out a monthly newsletter.
[01:56:14.989 --> 01:56:18.530]  I just sent one out last night, or I'm sending it out today to a lot of people.
[01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:20.050]  I got up at 3 in the morning working on it.
[01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:32.392]  It is deep analysis to really break down the month's news, the Matrix Monthly Newsletter, and the Club Blood membership, which gives you a lot of exclusive privileges, perks, bells, and whistles as well.
[01:56:32.472 --> 01:56:34.533]  So I didn't plug this for three days.
[01:56:34.553 --> 01:56:39.494]  I hope no one gets mad at me, but I just have to make that known that we need your support as well.
[01:56:39.834 --> 01:56:42.134]  Everybody here at this network needs your support.
[01:56:42.174 --> 01:56:43.054]  This is not easy.
[01:56:43.414 --> 01:56:45.855]  Obviously, we don't have the ability
[01:56:46.175 --> 01:56:54.564]  to put General Electric or Ford commercials or Big Pharma cartel commercials or Rockefeller Foundation commercials on this broadcast.
[01:56:55.024 --> 01:56:57.747]  They are not underwriting this program.
[01:56:58.067 --> 01:57:01.751]  We make it on our own, just like we all should be doing in America.
[01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:07.277]  We're individuals who are out there who care about our country, who are willing to fight back, to fight for you,
[01:57:07.797 --> 01:57:10.259]  But obviously, we're going to need a little support to do that.
[01:57:10.299 --> 01:57:11.900]  So keep supporting this broadcast.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.143]  Support my program, my broadcast, which starts every day right after Alex's show.
[01:57:16.663 --> 01:57:18.865]  Support people who are bringing you the truth.
[01:57:19.165 --> 01:57:20.546]  It doesn't matter who we are.
[01:57:20.826 --> 01:57:22.527]  It matters what you're getting.
[01:57:22.587 --> 01:57:24.188]  And check everything out for yourself.
[01:57:24.368 --> 01:57:25.109]  You'll see it's true.
[01:57:25.289 --> 01:57:26.510]  We'll be right back in about 70 seconds.
[01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:27.871]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:30.893 --> 01:57:35.136]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7777.
[01:57:46.967 --> 01:57:47.608]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.268 --> 01:57:49.328]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.048 --> 01:57:51.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:51.789 --> 01:57:52.609]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.369 --> 01:57:54.269]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.289 --> 01:57:58.771]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.111 --> 01:58:03.232]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.153 --> 01:58:09.494]  Third hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way.
[01:58:09.914 --> 01:58:12.615]  Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[01:58:12.735 --> 01:58:13.875]  Final day for me.
[01:58:14.617 --> 01:58:18.040]  And I only have three more hours of broadcasting to go and I'm just getting warmed up!
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:21.383]  I want to hear from everybody today at 800-259-9231.
[01:58:21.403 --> 01:58:27.328]  I've got a lot of news, but as I said, three hours to report it on this network today.
[01:58:27.348 --> 01:58:29.129]  So we're going to get through everything.
[01:58:29.169 --> 01:58:32.092]  We've got a call to action for Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:58:32.332 --> 01:58:33.133]  He needs your help.
[01:58:35.098 --> 01:58:38.100]  We were all under massive attack, and that's just how it's going to be.
[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:45.045]  But we knew when we were getting into this exactly what would happen, and we knew that if we had success, it would only intensify.
[01:58:45.865 --> 01:58:46.966]  But it just feels good.
[01:58:47.066 --> 01:58:49.468]  As President Bush likes to say, bring it on!
[01:58:50.308 --> 01:58:57.993]  So, we're out there again on the front lines fighting for you, and you are out there on the front lines fighting for your fellow citizens, and I congratulate you for that.
[01:58:58.013 --> 01:58:59.595]  We're going to go to the cause here in just one second.
[01:58:59.615 --> 01:59:01.256]  I've got to go over this story quickly.
[01:59:01.676 --> 01:59:01.976]  U.S.
[01:59:02.036 --> 01:59:04.598]  military links Karzai brothers to drugs.
[01:59:05.276 --> 01:59:08.961]  This is from ABC News Network, not from some blogger somewhere.
[01:59:09.482 --> 01:59:14.849]  Not that that would, by any means, relegate the information to the dustbin.
[01:59:14.909 --> 01:59:15.110]  No.
[01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:16.672]  I mean, ABC News is reporting this.
[01:59:17.835 --> 01:59:21.538]  And not that it must be true, but certainly it is very, very telling.
[01:59:21.558 --> 01:59:37.348]  A lot of people have been talking about this, how largely 9-11 was about drugs, about drug smuggling, how the invasion in Afghanistan was primarily about getting control of the massive multi-billions to trillion dollars worth of drugs moving out of there all the time.
[01:59:37.888 --> 01:59:38.129]  U.S.
[01:59:38.169 --> 01:59:45.934]  military documents obtained by ABC News list the brother of Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, former UNICAO employee,
[01:59:46.635 --> 01:59:51.251]  As a quote-unquote problem maker in the pay of drug lords.
[01:59:52.054 --> 01:59:52.475]  WALL-E!
[01:59:53.166 --> 01:59:53.906]  That's right, folks.
[01:59:54.287 --> 02:00:04.492]  Wally Karzai is described in the documents as, quote, receives money from drug lords as bribes to facilitate their work and movement.
[02:00:04.512 --> 02:00:08.334]  These documents mark secret, appear to be part of a, quote, U.S.
[02:00:08.414 --> 02:00:11.716]  military targeting assessment produced in January of 2005.
[02:00:11.756 --> 02:00:18.259]  The documents were downloaded from a computer, flashed as sold at an Afghanistan street bazaar for $200.
[02:00:20.603 --> 02:00:27.785]  Nine other prominent Afghanis are also listed as quote-unquote problem makers for a variety of reasons including connections to opium drug lords.
[02:00:28.405 --> 02:00:34.766]  Wally Karzai strongly denied the allegations in an interview with ABC News today in Kandahar.
[02:00:35.146 --> 02:00:42.348]  Quote, I was never in the drug business, I never benefited, I never facilitated, never helped anyone with the transport of any kind.
[02:00:43.048 --> 02:00:43.808]  Pass me the hookah.
[02:00:45.237 --> 02:00:50.501]  There had been previous speculation of the presidential brother's alleged connections to drugs, but the U.S.
[02:00:50.521 --> 02:00:55.585]  military documents are the first indication of how seriously the charges are taken by American officials.
[02:00:56.946 --> 02:01:03.510]  The Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on the content of the documents, although one official said they do appear to be genuine.
[02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:10.856]  The Los Angeles Times reported on similar documents discovered in a street bazaar in April, but did not report the allegations about Karzai.
[02:01:10.876 --> 02:01:12.537]  Very brave of you, Los Angeles Times.
[02:01:14.878 --> 02:01:14.978]  U.S.
[02:01:15.018 --> 02:01:18.759]  officials say they continue to investigate how sensitive documents ended up at the street bazaar.
[02:01:18.799 --> 02:01:20.740]  Well, look, folks, this isn't an accident.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.181]  Somebody let those documents out.
[02:01:23.221 --> 02:01:26.522]  They wanted this to come out for whatever reason.
[02:01:26.562 --> 02:01:29.623]  We can certainly speculate on why they might want to do that.
[02:01:29.663 --> 02:01:31.223]  I could spend an hour just speculating.
[02:01:31.423 --> 02:01:32.984]  We try not to do that on this program, though.
[02:01:33.004 --> 02:01:36.745]  It is a talk radio show, and we are allowed to do a little editorial.
[02:01:37.005 --> 02:01:39.592]  We're going to come back from this break and go right to your calls.
[02:01:40.053 --> 02:01:43.001]  Quickly, this is on my docket, so I've got to check it off.
[02:01:43.382 --> 02:01:44.806]  Cal Bend Soap Company.
[02:01:46.044 --> 02:01:46.904]  Very simple, folks.
[02:01:46.944 --> 02:01:49.085]  Cal-Ben soap is the best soap I've ever tried.
[02:01:49.985 --> 02:01:51.206]  I don't get paid to say that.
[02:01:51.246 --> 02:01:58.088]  In fact, yesterday, one of the listeners wrote me and said, well, I called Cal-Ben to get the special and mentioned Jack Blood.
[02:01:58.108 --> 02:01:59.229]  They didn't know what I was talking about.
[02:01:59.249 --> 02:02:01.089]  That's because this is the Alex Jones Show!
[02:02:01.289 --> 02:02:03.910]  You have to mention Alex Jones when you call them.
[02:02:04.110 --> 02:02:07.231]  Cal-Ben soap, pure, natural, good for the environment, safe.
[02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:10.152]  And I gotta tell you, folks, I even feel healthier using it.
[02:02:10.192 --> 02:02:11.153]  It just smells good.
[02:02:11.393 --> 02:02:12.173]  It feels good.
[02:02:12.193 --> 02:02:14.694]  You could literally... This is one of those soaps you could literally eat.
[02:02:15.314 --> 02:02:21.316]  And it's extremely cheap, much cheaper than the poison you're buying at the supermarket.
[02:02:22.196 --> 02:02:36.220]  Give them a call at 800-340-7091, 800-340-7091, or go to CalBenPureSoap, C-A-L-B-E-N, CalBenPureSoap.com, great, great like-minded sponsor of this program, non-corporate entity.
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:40.761]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, right after this, this is the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:42.518 --> 02:02:49.341]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:49.661 --> 02:02:51.041]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:51.221 --> 02:02:53.422]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:53.582 --> 02:02:55.663]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:55.943 --> 02:03:00.885]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:01.205 --> 02:03:05.247]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:05.507 --> 02:03:07.288]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:07.348 --> 02:03:17.994]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:18.155 --> 02:03:20.036]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:20.256 --> 02:03:24.118]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:46.691]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:04:47.031 --> 02:04:52.633]  A tornado is an easy to install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:04:52.933 --> 02:05:00.015]  I personally commissioned an independent test to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with tornado.
[02:05:00.155 --> 02:05:04.936]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[02:05:05.116 --> 02:05:10.658]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your tornado at Checkers, Shucks, and Cragen today.
[02:05:12.626 --> 02:05:16.368]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:05:16.608 --> 02:05:21.410]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:05:21.710 --> 02:05:23.191]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:05:23.451 --> 02:05:23.671]  No.
[02:05:23.991 --> 02:05:27.773]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:29.534]  Are all covers the same?
[02:05:29.774 --> 02:05:30.014]  No.
[02:05:30.274 --> 02:05:33.956]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:05:34.356 --> 02:05:36.477]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:05:36.757 --> 02:05:39.278]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[02:05:39.558 --> 02:05:41.339]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:05:43.709 --> 02:05:49.732]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:50.352 --> 02:05:53.333]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:12.293 --> 02:06:17.738]  Alright, we just want to go right to your calls, 800-259-9231, anything that is on your mind.
[02:06:17.758 --> 02:06:21.401]  You want to comment on these domestic terrorism, the summer of fear?
[02:06:21.421 --> 02:06:23.683]  Do you have any suggestions?
[02:06:24.604 --> 02:06:29.328]  You want to comment on this Karzai connection to the drug lords in Afghanistan?
[02:06:30.154 --> 02:06:31.915]  Anything you want to talk about for the next hour?
[02:06:31.935 --> 02:06:32.195]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:32.315 --> 02:06:35.737]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:35.797 --> 02:06:37.358]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex today.
[02:06:37.718 --> 02:06:44.202]  Alex should be back with you on Monday with a full report on the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Conference.
[02:06:44.442 --> 02:06:45.962]  Remember to go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:45.982 --> 02:06:50.505]  There are a lot of new articles coming out by Paul Joseph Watts, I think one of the better writers on the internet today.
[02:06:50.965 --> 02:06:55.107]  And all the news we're covering today coming right off of PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:56.748]  Let's go to Steve Mason.
[02:06:56.808 --> 02:07:01.210]  Steve Mason in Texas, who I know on the front lines for immigration and the border war.
[02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:02.450]  Steve, good to hear from you.
[02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:03.131]  You're on the show.
[02:07:03.671 --> 02:07:04.972]  Thanks, Jack.
[02:07:04.992 --> 02:07:10.954]  I wanted to announce to everybody about the 21st Century Paul Revere Ride that has started in Los Angeles.
[02:07:11.034 --> 02:07:14.476]  It is making its way across the country, rallying in various parts of the country.
[02:07:15.254 --> 02:07:18.836]  Against the illegal invasion, and they're going to end up in Washington, D.C.
[02:07:19.177 --> 02:07:22.199]  And you're a Minuteman, so I assume this is a Minuteman project here?
[02:07:22.539 --> 02:07:26.481]  No, it's a 21st century Paul Revere ride.
[02:07:26.522 --> 02:07:35.387]  It's put on by Frosty Wooldridge, who's one of the greatest speakers and writers and intellects in the immigration control movement.
[02:07:35.748 --> 02:07:38.049]  He's got a website at frostywoodridge.com.
[02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:40.391]  Any other plugs today, Steve?
[02:07:40.671 --> 02:07:40.991]  Pardon me?
[02:07:41.171 --> 02:07:42.272]  Any other plugs you want to get out here?
[02:07:42.608 --> 02:07:51.290]  Well, I wanted to announce to the people in Austin that the 21st Century Paul Revere Ride is coming through Austin on Sunday morning at the Capitol.
[02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:57.532]  At 9am to 10am, and they're going to proceed from there to Crawford, then up to Arlington, and on across the country.
[02:07:57.592 --> 02:08:03.433]  So this Sunday morning at the Statehouse, the Paul Revere Ride will roll through Austin, Texas and then head up to Crawford?
[02:08:04.073 --> 02:08:04.313]  Yeah.
[02:08:04.873 --> 02:08:07.134]  And I don't have a clone, so I won't be able to go.
[02:08:07.174 --> 02:08:10.915]  I guess the listeners will have to represent me there and Alex at the event.
[02:08:11.763 --> 02:08:12.563]  Well, okay.
[02:08:13.004 --> 02:08:15.845]  I want to give everybody the website if they're interested in the schedule.
[02:08:15.985 --> 02:08:16.825]  Go ahead.
[02:08:16.845 --> 02:08:19.986]  It's 21stCenturyPaulRevereRide.us.
[02:08:20.766 --> 02:08:21.247]  All right, Steve.
[02:08:21.367 --> 02:08:22.107]  Thanks for that, man.
[02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:23.207]  Keep up the good work, Steve.
[02:08:24.048 --> 02:08:24.788]  Appreciate the call.
[02:08:24.908 --> 02:08:26.669]  Let's go to Joan in Florida.
[02:08:26.909 --> 02:08:28.289]  Joan, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:28.489 --> 02:08:28.829]  Yes.
[02:08:28.889 --> 02:08:30.830]  Hi, Jack.
[02:08:32.411 --> 02:08:33.251]  Hello.
[02:08:33.611 --> 02:08:41.114]  Earlier on the show, you mentioned that on the Hannity and Combs last night, I'm getting an echo here.
[02:08:42.097 --> 02:08:44.198]  Well, you're coming through good on my end.
[02:08:44.318 --> 02:08:44.538]  Oh, okay.
[02:08:44.558 --> 02:08:44.778]  Alright.
[02:08:44.798 --> 02:08:45.979]  Let's see if we can work on it.
[02:08:45.999 --> 02:08:50.901]  Yeah, we actually played the clip of Jim Fetzer on the Sham the Tee and Combs program.
[02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:52.522]  Exactly.
[02:08:52.742 --> 02:08:57.444]  And it talked about the Secretary of Transportation, Mineta.
[02:08:57.884 --> 02:08:58.804]  Norman Mineta, yeah.
[02:08:58.844 --> 02:08:59.805]  Mineta, Mineta.
[02:09:00.545 --> 02:09:01.005]  Guess what?
[02:09:01.185 --> 02:09:11.290]  About an hour before you played that clip on the TV, they announced that he was stepping down today, the Secretary of Transportation.
[02:09:12.786 --> 02:09:16.429]  I was under the impression that Minetta had already stepped down, so... I don't know.
[02:09:16.469 --> 02:09:23.496]  They announced it like... Well, this administration goes through cabinet members like no other administration before them.
[02:09:24.016 --> 02:09:26.098]  They're not long for their jobs.
[02:09:26.178 --> 02:09:30.042]  And generally what we hear, Joan, is they want to go spend time with their family.
[02:09:30.142 --> 02:09:30.462]  Oh, yes.
[02:09:30.863 --> 02:09:31.143]  Oh, yes.
[02:09:31.676 --> 02:09:33.178]  And that's code 4.
[02:09:33.479 --> 02:09:34.580]  Get the heck out of here.
[02:09:34.621 --> 02:09:38.206]  We've got someone else who will follow the memos a little better than you.
[02:09:38.386 --> 02:09:41.991]  Well, the fellow that resigned the other day, he's gone to Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:42.432 --> 02:09:42.893]  That's right.
[02:09:42.913 --> 02:09:43.374]  Not a bad deal.
[02:09:43.394 --> 02:09:44.655]  You're talking about Zolnick?
[02:09:45.857 --> 02:09:46.959]  Yes, not a bad deal.
[02:09:47.139 --> 02:10:05.147]  Yeah, Mr. Zolnick, Trilateral Commission, Builder Burger, worked with the WTO to rape and pillage our country, helped in the Enron cover-up, an enabler of Wall Street, played a key role in NAFTA and CAFTA, two decades of GOP shilling, going to, as you said, Goldman Sachs.
[02:10:05.167 --> 02:10:10.869]  He really wanted that Treasury job, and I think was a little upset, but he was actually Condi's handler, I believe.
[02:10:10.909 --> 02:10:11.790]  He was number two
[02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:15.051]  By the way, I heard your prediction possibly... Oh, come on now, it was just on my tongue.
[02:10:39.772 --> 02:10:42.213]  I'm way out on a limb for the 2008 election.
[02:10:42.633 --> 02:10:47.776]  I don't mind doing that.
[02:10:47.997 --> 02:10:48.617]  John Edwards.
[02:10:49.237 --> 02:10:50.858]  This morning they were replaying.
[02:10:50.878 --> 02:10:54.140]  He was on one of the talk invite guests.
[02:10:55.734 --> 02:10:57.656]  There's little pushes here and there for him.
[02:10:57.696 --> 02:11:08.444]  His star is rising and I'm not making a prediction so much as I am a radio talk show host so I'm giving you my analysis much like Chris Matthews or anyone else would.
[02:11:09.245 --> 02:11:13.849]  Well listen I thought that was interesting that the Secretary of Transportation is
[02:11:14.949 --> 02:11:16.590]  What's the skinny down there in Florida?
[02:11:16.610 --> 02:11:25.837]  They got you guys all cowering in your boots over there because they wrapped up this giant terrorist plot there, which was already decoded as a massive sting operation.
[02:11:26.577 --> 02:11:28.338]  What's the feeling down there because of this?
[02:11:28.879 --> 02:11:30.700]  Well, I'm not that close to Miami.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:32.881]  I'm up here in the Tampa Bay area.
[02:11:33.322 --> 02:11:40.707]  But from what I get, a lot of people just think, they question whether this is
[02:11:41.474 --> 02:11:43.635]  Isn't that the truth, Joan?
[02:11:43.675 --> 02:11:48.597]  People just don't take a lot of stock in what's rolling off the Pentagon fax machine today.
[02:11:48.877 --> 02:11:57.821]  Well, it seems like once a day, or at least twice a day, there's something new to up-rile the nerves, the nervous system of the American people.
[02:11:58.041 --> 02:11:59.362]  The hurricanes are going to get you.
[02:11:59.382 --> 02:12:00.862]  The terrorists are going to get you.
[02:12:01.062 --> 02:12:02.743]  People with guns are going to get you.
[02:12:03.123 --> 02:12:04.784]  Oh, I know what I saw in a trailer today.
[02:12:07.611 --> 02:12:10.893]  Possibility of human-to-human bird flu in Malaysia.
[02:12:10.913 --> 02:12:11.593]  That's right.
[02:12:11.833 --> 02:12:13.234]  They tried to report that a few days ago.
[02:12:13.254 --> 02:12:18.897]  It just keeps hitting them over and over until I think so many are numb.
[02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:24.479]  Well, I want to take Bush's advice and I want to advise you, Joan, and the rest of you to stay the course.
[02:12:24.899 --> 02:12:26.520]  We're going to stay the course, George.
[02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:27.481]  Thanks for that advice.
[02:12:28.181 --> 02:12:31.583]  And George Bush, he said he was a uniter and not a divider.
[02:12:31.603 --> 02:12:36.165]  And he was right about that because he's united all of us together to fight for freedom.
[02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:42.474]  He's united a lot of people from the left and the right, and they don't care about the left and right anymore.
[02:12:42.874 --> 02:12:44.235]  They're getting focused.
[02:12:44.255 --> 02:12:47.057]  Well, let's make sure to smash those paradigms, Joan.
[02:12:47.097 --> 02:12:48.658]  Thank you so much for calling in today.
[02:12:48.678 --> 02:12:49.739]  You have a great weekend.
[02:12:50.119 --> 02:12:51.560]  Art is calling us from Kansas.
[02:12:51.681 --> 02:12:52.881]  Art, you're on the phone.
[02:12:53.102 --> 02:12:54.062]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:54.462 --> 02:12:54.803]  Hi.
[02:12:55.603 --> 02:12:57.605]  I've got to apologize for this phone line.
[02:12:57.665 --> 02:12:59.966]  It's been the pits since AT&T took over.
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:09.164]  We just reported yesterday there's a big NSA, AT&T internet spying hub in a secret bunker right there in Kansas City.
[02:13:09.745 --> 02:13:10.445]  Well, why not?
[02:13:10.945 --> 02:13:12.526]  I mean, that's where the railroad is going.
[02:13:13.227 --> 02:13:13.947]  From Mexico.
[02:13:14.787 --> 02:13:29.876]  I just want to say, I think the saddest aspect of this whole war is the fact that our intelligence and our military didn't learn a thing from the Soviet problem in Afghanistan 20 years ago.
[02:13:31.772 --> 02:13:33.113]  They finally picked up and left.
[02:13:33.673 --> 02:13:37.296]  Yeah, well, I'm not sure if that's the best analysis or not.
[02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:41.839]  I mean, look, but what is a good analysis is they don't seem to learn a thing.
[02:13:41.859 --> 02:13:44.201]  I mean, we remember the old adage, don't we Art?
[02:13:44.421 --> 02:13:46.862]  Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:13:47.283 --> 02:13:52.486]  Obviously somebody's not learning or, again as FDR said, there's no coincidences in politics.
[02:13:52.806 --> 02:13:53.107]  I know.
[02:13:55.108 --> 02:13:57.069]  Anyway, I just thought that's interesting.
[02:13:57.249 --> 02:13:59.391]  You know, there's a book called The Bear Trap.
[02:13:59.983 --> 02:14:01.905]  About the Soviets in Afghanistan.
[02:14:04.167 --> 02:14:04.687]  I'll check it out.
[02:14:05.128 --> 02:14:05.448]  Okay.
[02:14:05.648 --> 02:14:06.269]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:06.369 --> 02:14:19.280]  I mean, look, we've already got the preliminary or most of the info from that war in Afghanistan, as is the war in Kosovo, as the information coming from the entire continent of Africa, and we put that out on the air.
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:21.242]  But you can make of it what you want.
[02:14:21.562 --> 02:14:22.543]  That's the thing.
[02:14:22.763 --> 02:14:31.072]  When you listen to a show like this, we're not telling you, this is it, this is how it is, you gotta believe this, or you're wrong, or you're with the terrorists, or you're with the government, whatever it's going to be.
[02:14:31.312 --> 02:14:43.284]  We're just giving you the information that you're not getting in hopes that you'll double-check the facts, you'll get on board with us, and you'll get the information out if it meets with your common sense, with your gut, with your intuition.
[02:14:44.004 --> 02:14:50.987]  And I mean, just thank God for networks like this, not just this network, networks like this, that put out this information for all of you.
[02:14:51.307 --> 02:14:53.467]  Let's go to Dennis in New York.
[02:14:53.528 --> 02:14:54.288]  Is that right, Dennis?
[02:14:54.408 --> 02:14:55.468]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:55.488 --> 02:14:56.268]  Alright, how are you doing?
[02:14:56.369 --> 02:14:56.709]  Very good.
[02:14:56.929 --> 02:15:11.734]  Yeah, I happened to just be watching CNN a little while ago, and they had a guy on named Paul Callen, who's a former federal prosecutor, and he pretty much confirmed everything that Alex had said in the beginning of the show, that the whole thing was a setup, that this guy instigated them.
[02:15:12.495 --> 02:15:14.838]  Well, this was on CNN last night.
[02:15:15.258 --> 02:15:26.392]  Master GHG Athia, which is one of the suspect's friends, said, quote, someone along the line offered to him some funds to do whatever he wanted to do, if that's what he wanted to do.
[02:15:26.712 --> 02:15:31.879]  And as far as some subversive work, and he said that they would give him whatever he needed.
[02:15:32.259 --> 02:15:41.928]  So again, I mean, they baited, they found some people they could bait, they gave them a bunch of money, the people obviously didn't have very good judgment, and they played right into the hands of the FBI.
[02:15:42.028 --> 02:15:50.235]  I was amazed it was on CNN, because this guy said right out that he was, you know, he told them that he was with Al Qaeda, and he got them to take the oath to Al Qaeda.
[02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:53.711]  And that he instigated the whole thing, and they just went along with him.
[02:15:53.931 --> 02:16:01.674]  And of course, that's even hard to kind of make an analysis to, because they're trying to portray this as domestic terrorism.
[02:16:01.734 --> 02:16:08.437]  Are they now saying that there might have been some connections to Al-Qaeda, or that's just the line this guy used in order to get these guys wrapped up?
[02:16:08.677 --> 02:16:13.959]  Yeah, well, like I said, but he's, you know, they're saying that the FBI informant had said this, that he was Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:14.019 --> 02:16:14.219]  Right.
[02:16:14.939 --> 02:16:15.980]  So, I don't know what's going on.
[02:16:16.511 --> 02:16:22.673]  Well, we do, and actually this just happened yesterday, and we've already got a pretty good analysis on what's happening, and it's just more of the same.
[02:16:22.693 --> 02:16:27.654]  I think Alex really articulated this earlier in the first hour, and if you missed that, just go back and listen to it.
[02:16:27.674 --> 02:16:30.155]  No, like I said, that was why I called, because this is exactly what he had said.
[02:16:30.375 --> 02:16:30.835]  There you go.
[02:16:30.855 --> 02:16:31.855]  Anything else, Dennis?
[02:16:31.895 --> 02:16:32.515]  That's about it.
[02:16:32.755 --> 02:16:33.715]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:16:33.776 --> 02:16:36.556]  Tim in Utah, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:37.617 --> 02:16:37.877]  Da?
[02:16:38.237 --> 02:16:38.977]  Yes, you're on the air.
[02:16:40.106 --> 02:16:43.088]  Yeah, actually we're from Nebraska, but we're in Utah.
[02:16:43.108 --> 02:16:44.429]  We're headed to Los Angeles.
[02:16:44.489 --> 02:16:46.190]  Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
[02:16:46.570 --> 02:16:47.030]  Alright.
[02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:49.132]  Nice road trip with a great ending.
[02:16:50.172 --> 02:16:52.193]  Yeah, you say you used to live in Las Vegas.
[02:16:52.574 --> 02:16:55.095]  How far is it from Las Vegas to Los Angeles?
[02:16:55.215 --> 02:16:57.076]  It's not that far, actually.
[02:16:57.617 --> 02:16:59.358]  It used to be Route 66 would take you.
[02:16:59.378 --> 02:17:01.039]  It's a straight shot right out there.
[02:17:01.759 --> 02:17:04.541]  And probably, you're looking at maybe
[02:17:06.556 --> 02:17:08.418]  I'm at a guest site because it's been so long since I made the trip.
[02:17:08.438 --> 02:17:10.300]  Probably about three and a half, four hours tops.
[02:17:11.281 --> 02:17:11.641]  Okay.
[02:17:11.661 --> 02:17:12.482]  Maybe not even that long.
[02:17:12.502 --> 02:17:14.964]  I don't really have anything to add to the show.
[02:17:15.004 --> 02:17:17.507]  Do you want directions and a timeline for your travel?
[02:17:17.607 --> 02:17:18.368]  Right, right.
[02:17:19.328 --> 02:17:21.090]  And you're in the car and you're heading to the conference.
[02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:22.692]  I'll look forward to meeting you there, Tim.
[02:17:23.417 --> 02:17:23.657]  Okay.
[02:17:23.677 --> 02:17:24.278]  It's going to be great.
[02:17:24.318 --> 02:17:25.679]  Charlie Sheen is going to be speaking.
[02:17:25.699 --> 02:17:28.462]  A lot of guest surprise speakers are going to be speaking at the conference.
[02:17:29.102 --> 02:17:31.024]  People covering it from all over the world.
[02:17:31.324 --> 02:17:33.286]  Alex Jones giving the keynote address.
[02:17:33.546 --> 02:17:35.388]  Looking forward to seeing everybody that's going out there.
[02:17:35.408 --> 02:17:36.508]  We'll come right back after this, folks.
[02:17:36.729 --> 02:17:38.450]  More news and information you're not getting anywhere else.
[02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:39.231]  The Alex Jones Show.

[02:18:19.788 --> 02:18:27.349]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[02:18:27.409 --> 02:18:30.990]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:18:31.170 --> 02:18:32.691]  Secure your position today.
[02:18:32.991 --> 02:18:34.231]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:34.251 --> 02:18:34.491]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:44.358 --> 02:18:45.399]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:51.286]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:51.847 --> 02:18:52.347]  That's right.
[02:18:52.668 --> 02:18:55.331]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:56.352 --> 02:19:02.439]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:02.995 --> 02:19:10.684]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:11.145 --> 02:19:15.931]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:16.605 --> 02:19:22.027]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:22.408 --> 02:19:26.549]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:26.929 --> 02:19:27.170]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:29.130]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.491]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.791 --> 02:19:30.071]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:42.415 --> 02:19:45.696]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:45.756 --> 02:19:49.918]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:50.178 --> 02:19:52.979]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:53.159 --> 02:19:55.560]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:04.403]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:04.583 --> 02:20:05.943]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:20:06.124 --> 02:20:10.265]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:10.265 --> 02:20:10.925]  We're good to go!
[02:20:39.426 --> 02:20:40.673]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:42.310 --> 02:20:47.573]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[02:20:47.833 --> 02:20:50.434]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[02:20:50.874 --> 02:20:53.435]  But then my podiatrist gave me Kallax Ointment.
[02:20:53.796 --> 02:20:58.758]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[02:20:58.998 --> 02:21:02.540]  Kallax never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:04.421]  Now they look and feel great!
[02:21:04.761 --> 02:21:08.242]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Kallax Ointment.
[02:21:08.563 --> 02:21:11.464]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[02:21:12.915 --> 02:21:15.396]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:21:15.857 --> 02:21:17.758]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:21:18.478 --> 02:21:21.660]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:28.783]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:21:29.564 --> 02:21:31.745]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:21:32.145 --> 02:21:32.565]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:32.665 --> 02:21:33.966]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:42.801 --> 02:21:48.345]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:35.312 --> 02:22:37.113]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:37.173 --> 02:22:38.473]  Jack Blood, your radio gun.
[02:22:38.493 --> 02:22:46.575]  I'm here with you for about another 35 minutes and then I'll be doing my program for two hours in this very network deadline live with Jack Blood.
[02:22:47.403 --> 02:22:49.044]  We're going to keep rolling with the phone calls.
[02:22:49.084 --> 02:22:50.325]  Again, we've got a lot of news to report.
[02:22:50.345 --> 02:22:53.008]  We'll sneak some of it in, but I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:22:53.028 --> 02:22:56.270]  This is a good opportunity in an open line format to get something on the record.
[02:22:56.290 --> 02:22:57.211]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:57.751 --> 02:23:00.794]  I think we might even have one line open.
[02:23:01.454 --> 02:23:01.815]  Or not.
[02:23:01.855 --> 02:23:03.256]  But if somebody drops, you can get in.
[02:23:03.476 --> 02:23:05.257]  Let's go to Thomas in Tennessee.
[02:23:05.297 --> 02:23:06.438]  Thomas, thank you for calling.
[02:23:06.458 --> 02:23:07.779]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:09.361]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:23:09.741 --> 02:23:10.422]  Very good.
[02:23:10.662 --> 02:23:11.082]  Hey, listen.
[02:23:11.242 --> 02:23:12.703]  I'm just so mad.
[02:23:14.062 --> 02:23:22.625]  I want to show how phony and fake the mainstream media is.
[02:23:22.686 --> 02:23:25.247]  They say they're trying to get George Bush.
[02:23:25.567 --> 02:23:26.667]  They're against George Bush.
[02:23:26.927 --> 02:23:28.628]  If they really wanted to hurt him,
[02:23:29.164 --> 02:23:45.358]  They would jump all over this 9-11 thing, and they would push it themselves, and they're just throwing little hardballs... Well, not if it shows that all of their prime movers on the 9-11 Commission, the phony CFR Whitewash Commission, or the 9-11-O Mission, as I like to call it, were in on it.
[02:23:46.145 --> 02:23:47.326]  They don't want that to come out.
[02:23:47.446 --> 02:23:48.747]  It's just a bunch of crap.
[02:23:49.147 --> 02:23:50.388]  But you know what they would do?
[02:23:50.448 --> 02:23:57.051]  They would use a lot of the information that we have that actually could be used in a partisan effort to get rid of George Bush.
[02:23:57.111 --> 02:24:02.314]  Instead, I'm looking at these debates over the war, the war over the war, and it just looks like they're imploding.
[02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:03.415]  They're imploding.
[02:24:04.528 --> 02:24:10.198]  I was filling up my gas tank the other day, and I remember, if you might remember back in 91, I bought a GL Metro back in 91.
[02:24:10.719 --> 02:24:17.712]  It got 58 miles to the gallon on the highway, and it cost me maybe $8 to fill my tank.
[02:24:19.099 --> 02:24:25.881]  Why in the world can't all the technology that we have, we can't make an engine that's better than 91?
[02:24:26.661 --> 02:24:34.262]  But when I filled my little Ford Ranger the other day, it cost me $25 to get it three quarters of the way full.
[02:24:34.602 --> 02:24:37.523]  And I just keep thinking, George Bush, you creep!
[02:24:37.943 --> 02:24:40.283]  Every time I fill my tank, I'm so mad.
[02:24:40.643 --> 02:24:42.684]  Have you ever heard of acetone in your gas tank?
[02:24:42.724 --> 02:24:48.165]  I was listening to, I guess it was Gary Brownfield, I heard someone call in and said truckers are using acetone.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:51.462]  In their fuel and diesel.
[02:24:51.602 --> 02:24:53.844]  Have you heard anything about that?
[02:24:53.864 --> 02:24:58.106]  There are a lot of additives that can certainly make your car go better and fuel injection.
[02:24:58.307 --> 02:25:01.149]  See, the thing is, is that cars have actually improved.
[02:25:01.489 --> 02:25:06.292]  It's just that the gas has gotten worse and certainly the price of gas has shot through the roof.
[02:25:06.332 --> 02:25:12.276]  So, and then of course, you know, our cost of living goes up and somehow our wages go down.
[02:25:12.596 --> 02:25:16.239]  And this, you know, gets us to these scabs that run through the border
[02:25:16.719 --> 02:25:18.641]  Uh, to take the jobs to do that we won't do.
[02:25:18.761 --> 02:25:22.643]  You know, like those good construction jobs you used to get paid $18 an hour for.
[02:25:22.663 --> 02:25:24.465]  You know, you're looking to get $8 an hour for.
[02:25:24.525 --> 02:25:25.105]  So, yeah.
[02:25:25.265 --> 02:25:26.626]  I mean, they say there's no inflation.
[02:25:26.806 --> 02:25:27.467]  Give me a break!
[02:25:28.027 --> 02:25:30.009]  You know, and you do get mad when you go fill up your tank.
[02:25:30.069 --> 02:25:34.572]  I got a little, I have a little Toyota, and it takes, uh, a very small amount of gas.
[02:25:34.632 --> 02:25:36.793]  It costs about $25 to fill the thing up now.
[02:25:36.833 --> 02:25:39.015]  I mean, but we do a lot of walking, let me tell ya.
[02:25:39.315 --> 02:25:46.600]  But there is, the technology exists from hydrogen to biofuel to solar power to pure electric.
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:56.126]  The technology is there, but the big five motor companies are saying, you don't want the technology, so they're going to wait until you demand it before they put it into action.
[02:25:56.606 --> 02:26:00.268]  So you can use acetone in the gas tank from like auto parts stores and things like that?
[02:26:00.448 --> 02:26:04.331]  I'm not an expert on that, so I'd check that out with somebody else, but I have heard that as well.
[02:26:04.795 --> 02:26:11.878]  Okay, well the true patriots in this country need to stand up and get rid of the IRS and get rid of these phony balonies in the White House and get some real people in there.
[02:26:11.898 --> 02:26:13.578]  Expose the Federal Reserve!
[02:26:13.918 --> 02:26:14.959]  Exactly, man.
[02:26:15.179 --> 02:26:16.759]  It all begins and ends there.
[02:26:17.039 --> 02:26:18.060]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:18.900]  I appreciate that, Thomas.
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:19.460]  Stay mad!
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:20.981]  You know, it's good for you.
[02:26:21.041 --> 02:26:21.801]  Keeps you alive.
[02:26:21.841 --> 02:26:22.841]  Makes you know you're alive.
[02:26:23.062 --> 02:26:32.505]  When you stop getting mad and you start sinking in apathy in front of those 500 channels of programming, you know you've lost the war for yourself and for your family.
[02:26:34.023 --> 02:26:36.684]  Because we just brought up the Federal Reserve, I want to go over this really quick.
[02:26:38.025 --> 02:26:41.066]  This is a letter sent to me by one of the listeners.
[02:26:41.106 --> 02:26:44.887]  And by the way, probably the best way to reach me, believe it or not, is through MySpace.
[02:26:44.947 --> 02:26:46.868]  Just Google me or whatever you do.
[02:26:46.928 --> 02:26:48.028]  Jack Blood, MySpace.
[02:26:49.254 --> 02:26:50.695]  Friend me over there to get my bulletins.
[02:26:50.715 --> 02:26:52.275]  This is maybe one of the best ways to get me.
[02:26:52.335 --> 02:26:53.556]  And I get a lot of mail over there.
[02:26:53.596 --> 02:26:54.636]  This is something I got.
[02:26:55.476 --> 02:27:00.058]  It is from Ron Paul's adversary here in Texas.
[02:27:00.078 --> 02:27:02.999]  Of course, the elections are coming up for everybody, including Ron Paul.
[02:27:03.559 --> 02:27:07.280]  I want to come back and I want to talk about this because this guy is asking for it.
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:08.621]  He wants action.
[02:27:08.841 --> 02:27:10.881]  He doesn't understand what Ron Paul is doing.
[02:27:10.901 --> 02:27:16.023]  We're going to make it very clear to him and everybody else very soon here as we tear his phone lines up.
[02:27:16.383 --> 02:27:17.083]  Stay tuned, folks.
[02:27:17.103 --> 02:27:18.163]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[02:29:44.855 --> 02:29:46.956]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[02:29:47.296 --> 02:29:49.316]  And check this out, I bought a new car.
[02:29:49.416 --> 02:29:54.637]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[02:29:55.218 --> 02:29:59.338]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[02:29:59.678 --> 02:30:04.579]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.

[02:30:44.636 --> 02:30:44.976]  Get mad.
[02:30:45.056 --> 02:30:45.616]  Get even.
[02:31:02.341 --> 02:31:03.302]  You gotta be alive!
[02:31:03.322 --> 02:31:04.283]  You gotta feel something!
[02:31:04.303 --> 02:31:05.263]  You gotta get mad!
[02:31:05.744 --> 02:31:13.510]  But you can't get so mad that you lose perspective and you lose what you're fighting for, what's really important to you.
[02:31:15.572 --> 02:31:18.254]  So, we gotta be mad, but we gotta keep loving our lives.
[02:31:18.974 --> 02:31:19.455]  Yeah, I know.
[02:31:19.955 --> 02:31:21.756]  I know, that doesn't sound good to a lot of you.
[02:31:22.357 --> 02:31:23.138]  That love thing.
[02:31:23.178 --> 02:31:25.760]  People are weak who love their neighbor.
[02:31:28.462 --> 02:31:29.943]  I wanna go, uh, continue to go over this.
[02:31:31.008 --> 02:31:35.535]  This is a letter from Shane Schuyler, I guess you would pronounce his name.
[02:31:35.575 --> 02:31:45.070]  He's running in the same district, District 14, with Congressman Ron Paul, who has been a huge asset to us, one of the only good guys in Congress today.
[02:31:46.329 --> 02:31:48.250]  And here's his take on it.
[02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:56.993]  Hurricane season is upon us and Libertarian Congressman Ron Paul thinks we've forgotten his shameful record on relief and recovery.
[02:31:57.433 --> 02:32:09.658]  Last week, Paul triumphantly announced that Congress had passed hurricane relief funding and that he and his colleagues have worked to obtain 90% reimbursement for Texas communities affected by Hurricane Rita.
[02:32:10.658 --> 02:32:21.504]  He goes on to say, well, Ron Paul didn't vote for the bill, because the bill is loaded up with more government in your lives, more intrusion and more control.
[02:32:21.524 --> 02:32:26.327]  This is something that Ron Paul is proud that he protects his constituents from.
[02:32:27.068 --> 02:32:27.909]  This is exactly it.
[02:32:27.969 --> 02:32:29.150]  Get government out of our lives.
[02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:30.291]  We're going to take care of this.
[02:32:30.331 --> 02:32:32.433]  You know, write us a check with no strings attached.
[02:32:32.613 --> 02:32:41.362]  But the problem is, there are no checks coming from the Beltway, from Washington, D.C., from K Street, that don't have strings attached to it.
[02:32:41.622 --> 02:32:47.347]  So eventually, you want to do the right thing for your constituents, but you can't because there are so many strings attached.
[02:32:47.687 --> 02:32:50.090]  Obviously, Mr. Schuyler doesn't get this.
[02:32:50.845 --> 02:32:58.669]  And for some reason he thinks that this message is going to resonate with the people of District 41 here in Texas and he's taking on Ron Paul.
[02:32:58.869 --> 02:33:07.894]  I don't think Ron has anything to worry about by Shane Skyler because obviously the people of District 41 know who they have and really are 14 and really appreciate...
[02:33:08.742 --> 02:33:09.702]  What Ron Paul has done for him.
[02:33:09.883 --> 02:33:12.023]  And you appreciate Ron Paul all around the country.
[02:33:12.063 --> 02:33:18.346]  So, Skyler wants us to forward messages to our friends, spread the word about the real Ron Paul.
[02:33:18.386 --> 02:33:23.308]  You know the real Ron Paul that wants to not just reform the United Nations, but abolish it.
[02:33:24.088 --> 02:33:30.711]  The Ron Paul that wants to not just reform, or even for once audit the Federal Reserve, but to repeal it.
[02:33:31.371 --> 02:33:32.531]  Repeal central banks.
[02:33:32.771 --> 02:33:36.973]  The Ron Paul who wants government out of our lives as a true conservative.
[02:33:38.162 --> 02:33:39.823]  That's the real Ron Paul.
[02:33:39.863 --> 02:33:41.063]  We should let people know.
[02:33:41.303 --> 02:33:47.766]  So I think we should let Shane Skyler know about the real Ron Paul and how we support him.
[02:33:47.806 --> 02:33:55.189]  I don't care if you live in Germany, or if you live in Seattle, Washington, or New York, or Florida, or Chicago.
[02:33:55.629 --> 02:33:59.071]  Let's go ahead and let Shane know exactly how we feel.
[02:33:59.591 --> 02:34:05.093]  That we support Ron Paul, not only here in Texas, specifically in Texas, but all around the country.
[02:34:05.967 --> 02:34:08.229]  That he is probably the bravest congressman we've ever had.
[02:34:09.249 --> 02:34:11.451]  At least in the last 150 years.
[02:34:12.032 --> 02:34:13.172]  Jane Skyler, here's his number.
[02:34:13.473 --> 02:34:13.813]  Get a pen.
[02:34:13.833 --> 02:34:13.893]  361-574-9988.
[02:34:14.714 --> 02:34:19.918]  Jane, your phones are about to ring off the hook, buddy.
[02:34:19.938 --> 02:34:19.978]  361-574-9988.
[02:34:30.109 --> 02:34:36.274]  And Paul's work on the neocons is spectacular, where he points out that they're all Trotskyites.
[02:34:38.956 --> 02:34:41.779]  Super neoliberals who have become neocons.
[02:34:41.819 --> 02:34:47.463]  So let's let Shane Schuyler, who thinks he is being tricky here, let's let him know what we think.
[02:34:47.483 --> 02:34:47.864]  361-574-9988.
[02:34:47.884 --> 02:34:49.385]  Gives us something to do.
[02:34:49.425 --> 02:34:49.605]  It's fun.
[02:34:53.877 --> 02:34:56.259]  This is fun to beat these guys up and put them in their place.
[02:34:56.539 --> 02:34:59.982]  Let them know who you really support, and this is going to backfire on this guy.
[02:35:00.022 --> 02:35:00.923]  Let's make sure it does.
[02:35:01.644 --> 02:35:04.706]  Let's show these people that we support, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:35:05.727 --> 02:35:07.448]  Let's go to Paul in Baltimore.
[02:35:07.488 --> 02:35:08.429]  Paul, thank you for holding.
[02:35:08.449 --> 02:35:09.510]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:10.271 --> 02:35:10.551]  Yes.
[02:35:10.751 --> 02:35:12.833]  Hello, Jack.
[02:35:12.973 --> 02:35:13.794]  Yes, you're on the line.
[02:35:14.915 --> 02:35:18.398]  Yes, I just plugged my charger in.
[02:35:18.858 --> 02:35:19.478]  Thanks for sharing.
[02:35:20.579 --> 02:35:20.940]  Let's see.
[02:35:22.270 --> 02:35:28.232]  I'm getting a reverb here, but... Well, I hear you fine, so make a point for us, put something on the record, Paul.
[02:35:28.573 --> 02:35:29.793]  Right, I understand.
[02:35:30.073 --> 02:35:37.236]  I'd like to mention that there is a website out there that's called giveupblog.com.
[02:35:37.276 --> 02:35:42.858]  It's got Hitler vs. culture quiz, and you can find it by doing a Google search.
[02:35:43.498 --> 02:35:47.420]  Hitler, culture, and quiz, and it's hilarious.
[02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:51.014]  You cannot tell the difference between Ann Coulter and Hitler.
[02:35:52.115 --> 02:35:54.117]  Have you seen... I haven't, though.
[02:35:54.537 --> 02:35:56.919]  I'm a little sick of Ann Coulter, let me tell ya.
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:05.046]  A little bit goes a long way with that woman, but... Yeah, I mean, she's very easy to poke fun at, and I don't doubt that.
[02:36:05.266 --> 02:36:10.851]  Her statements actually can fit side-by-side, and if you read them, you wouldn't know if it was Hitler or Ann Coulter.
[02:36:11.051 --> 02:36:12.012]  Same thing with George Bush.
[02:36:12.492 --> 02:36:13.293]  Or John Ashcroft.
[02:36:14.924 --> 02:36:20.965]  Another book I wanted to mention is by Gustav Gilbert, who was an interrogator during Nuremberg trials.
[02:36:21.526 --> 02:36:29.047]  He wrote a book called The Nuremberg Diary, and he's got a Herman Goering quote, which is incredible.
[02:36:29.247 --> 02:36:34.129]  It totally describes what... Do you have it in front of you?
[02:36:34.669 --> 02:36:35.289]  Yes, I do.
[02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.669]  Read it.
[02:36:36.489 --> 02:36:44.411]  Okay, it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament.
[02:36:45.037 --> 02:36:46.358]  Or a communist dictatorship.
[02:36:46.838 --> 02:36:50.641]  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
[02:36:51.161 --> 02:36:51.881]  That is easy.
[02:36:52.442 --> 02:37:00.847]  All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
[02:37:01.347 --> 02:37:03.249]  It works the same in any country.
[02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:05.290]  Vice Marshal Herman Goering.
[02:37:05.973 --> 02:37:10.875]  This was recorded by Gustav Gilbert in his book.
[02:37:11.235 --> 02:37:16.617]  Would you be surprised if I told you, Paul, that I have a giant laminated version of that quote on my studio wall?
[02:37:17.497 --> 02:37:19.298]  Wow, but it's documented.
[02:37:20.078 --> 02:37:22.379]  It's not in the trial transcripts.
[02:37:23.059 --> 02:37:27.101]  This was recorded in Gilbert's actual diary.
[02:37:28.089 --> 02:37:33.115]  Sure, and it almost sounds like something that Nero might say, or Caesar might say.
[02:37:33.135 --> 02:37:35.898]  We've heard quotes like this throughout history.
[02:37:36.838 --> 02:37:40.801]  It sounds like something the Bush administration would say in their closed door meetings.
[02:37:41.242 --> 02:37:44.384]  It sounds like something our next president, whoever that might be, might say.
[02:37:44.404 --> 02:37:45.725]  Because we're going to get more of the same.
[02:37:45.905 --> 02:37:47.647]  Hey, Paul, thanks for the call, man, and the quote.
[02:37:47.667 --> 02:37:48.788]  You have a great weekend, okay?
[02:37:49.068 --> 02:37:49.288]  Right.
[02:37:49.749 --> 02:37:52.331]  Leslie in Virginia, thank you for holding.
[02:37:52.351 --> 02:37:53.532]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:53.812 --> 02:37:55.513]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[02:37:55.653 --> 02:37:56.294]  You got it.
[02:37:56.314 --> 02:37:57.555]  I have a message for Shane.
[02:37:58.095 --> 02:37:58.636]  What is his name?
[02:37:58.656 --> 02:37:59.476]  Shane Scholar?
[02:37:59.757 --> 02:38:00.457]  Yeah.
[02:38:00.517 --> 02:38:02.539]  Shane, this is Leslie from Virginia.
[02:38:03.374 --> 02:38:26.617]  And I challenge you, and I'll give you a call of course after this, I get off the phone with this person, and I challenge you to go after the SPP partnership that Bush signed, that's for starters, that's the Security and Prosperity Partnership, and that's with Vincente Fox, and that's with Paul Martin, the Canadian Prime Minister for the Union
[02:38:27.048 --> 02:38:27.909]  I don't think so.
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:46.241]  And get a congressional investigation.
[02:38:46.281 --> 02:38:48.343]  He's done nothing but put out spam.
[02:38:48.363 --> 02:38:49.343]  He has no track record.
[02:38:49.383 --> 02:38:51.164]  He's done nothing to defend the citizens of Texas.
[02:38:51.184 --> 02:38:52.965]  The point is, anybody can run for anything.
[02:38:53.225 --> 02:38:56.427]  We want to see what he produces in the next month.
[02:38:56.767 --> 02:38:58.228]  So come on, Shane.
[02:38:58.608 --> 02:39:00.830]  Come belly up to the bar.
[02:39:01.170 --> 02:39:01.850]  That's right.
[02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:02.851]  I love that.
[02:39:02.971 --> 02:39:03.691]  That's awesome.
[02:39:03.891 --> 02:39:05.152]  Well, let's take it to this guy.
[02:39:09.114 --> 02:39:09.815]  That's right.
[02:39:10.215 --> 02:39:11.376]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:39:11.536 --> 02:39:16.701]  Well, look, you guys give it to him and, you know, hey, I wanted to make a little announcement because we support Ron.
[02:39:17.121 --> 02:39:21.365]  He's got the track record that beats out every congressman in this country.
[02:39:21.385 --> 02:39:22.927]  You can name anyone you want.
[02:39:23.167 --> 02:39:26.029]  Senators, congressmen, Ron Paul has been fighting for us.
[02:39:26.530 --> 02:39:29.292]  And, yeah, he doesn't want to vote for more government control.
[02:39:33.044 --> 02:39:36.665]  It's actually better, Leslie, if they do nothing than what they want to do.
[02:39:36.705 --> 02:39:38.246]  I'm talking about the shame person.
[02:39:38.566 --> 02:39:43.247]  But it's actually better if you don't vote for anything and just create gridlock than what this guy wants to do.
[02:39:43.287 --> 02:39:44.127]  Let me tell you something.
[02:39:44.647 --> 02:39:47.388]  We all know about your man.
[02:39:47.408 --> 02:39:48.548]  Your man is fantastic.
[02:39:48.909 --> 02:39:52.770]  I'm saying this guy, you know, nothing's stopping him.
[02:39:52.830 --> 02:39:53.630]  Belly up to the bar.
[02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:55.510]  Well, that's good.
[02:39:55.811 --> 02:39:58.272]  Take the challenge, and I can't wait for the debate.
[02:39:58.332 --> 02:39:59.793]  I want to see some action around here.
[02:40:00.053 --> 02:40:00.513]  Me too.
[02:40:00.633 --> 02:40:01.054]  Thank you.
[02:40:01.114 --> 02:40:02.134]  Thank you for the call, Leslie.
[02:40:02.154 --> 02:40:02.855]  Have a good weekend.
[02:40:03.095 --> 02:40:05.216]  We've got W calling from Texco.
[02:40:05.736 --> 02:40:06.457]  W, is that you?
[02:40:06.977 --> 02:40:17.863]  You see, W has a hard time getting out a sentence, and I think that his controllers instantly just beeped him right off the air.
[02:40:18.123 --> 02:40:20.084]  Chris in Florida, thank you for holding.
[02:40:20.104 --> 02:40:21.105]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:22.066 --> 02:40:26.328]  Jack, I think there might be a problem with the Google searching on Alex's website.
[02:40:26.829 --> 02:40:28.870]  They actually might be blocking some of the searches.
[02:40:29.810 --> 02:40:41.636]  Because I've done a search on an article that I had searched for a few months ago by Todd Duransky on the three and a half million dollars that Bush requested for the Korean light water reactors.
[02:40:42.277 --> 02:40:43.277]  And now it's not there.
[02:40:43.637 --> 02:40:48.540]  And that's an article that I know was reflected all over the net on different websites.
[02:40:49.079 --> 02:40:50.580]  But now they're not even coming up.
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:52.641]  Well that's the problem.
[02:40:52.661 --> 02:41:01.365]  I mean unless we copy this and paste it and keep it forever and look there's so much news coming out that would be very expensive and very time-consuming.
[02:41:01.646 --> 02:41:02.446]  We're going to lose stuff.
[02:41:02.486 --> 02:41:08.809]  That's why when you hear something the best thing to do Chris is to copy it yourself right away and keep it in the records.
[02:41:08.849 --> 02:41:11.411]  But we have a few webmasters listening to this program.
[02:41:11.431 --> 02:41:12.231]  We'll look into that.
[02:41:12.451 --> 02:41:17.514]  The search engines are very very complicated and very tricky on individual websites and sometimes
[02:41:17.814 --> 02:41:19.980]  It's still there, you just gotta look for it.
[02:41:21.023 --> 02:41:25.194]  My advice is when you hear something good, copy it immediately and keep it for your records.
[02:41:26.016 --> 02:41:26.857]  Well, I did copy it.
[02:41:26.877 --> 02:41:33.820]  I actually emailed the author of the article, Todd Zuranski, who's with Bloomberg News, because it wasn't on Bloomberg's website.
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:36.782]  They just keep the most recent articles on there.
[02:41:37.482 --> 02:41:47.808]  And when I emailed him just to verify that he had written it, he emailed me right away back saying, you know, giving me a full copy of the article and saying that he had written it, and he's surprised it isn't very, uh...
[02:41:48.428 --> 02:41:50.789]  Very popular these days, they don't repeat that.
[02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:52.630]  I wish I had more help, Chris.
[02:41:53.091 --> 02:41:55.152]  Yeah, I think Google's blocking it.
[02:41:55.852 --> 02:41:56.792]  Wouldn't surprise me.
[02:41:57.853 --> 02:42:01.335]  And I also wanted to encourage people to call in the talk shows.
[02:42:02.215 --> 02:42:06.397]  It's so easy to get through, even the national talk shows, except for Hannity and Limbaugh.
[02:42:06.998 --> 02:42:08.619]  There's very little hold time.
[02:42:08.639 --> 02:42:17.243]  It shows that they really don't have much ratings, and it gives us a great chance to educate the country, fight the repetition of lies,
[02:42:18.174 --> 02:42:26.638]  Well when you do, mention Jack Blood and Alex Jones and GCN, but you know there's a guy named John Connor out there who's actually sitting in for me on my show on Monday and he holds the record.
[02:42:26.679 --> 02:42:31.461]  He gets in a few of these a week, gets into Hannity a couple of times a week and just will not let up.
[02:42:31.501 --> 02:42:35.083]  And you're right, you can get through, it just takes a little determination and a little patience.
[02:42:35.823 --> 02:42:38.205]  Sure, yeah and it's really amazing their responses.
[02:42:38.265 --> 02:42:38.885]  I mean they have
[02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:46.353]  Such few lies, and we have a huge arsenal of facts, many of which they shy away from, and they score when you mention them.
[02:42:46.373 --> 02:42:52.657]  Let me just say this, Chris, and I gotta let you go and wish you a good weekend, but when you do make these calls, make sure your points are organized.
[02:42:52.697 --> 02:42:57.981]  You know, have the best, most verifiable source information in front of you that you can have.
[02:42:58.221 --> 02:42:59.382]  Practice it a little bit.
[02:42:59.542 --> 02:43:07.687]  You know, you might only get 30 to 60 seconds, and make sure you put something on the record that they cannot refute or deny, and it will just make them look like liars.
[02:43:08.246 --> 02:43:09.167]  Well, I've done that before.
[02:43:09.187 --> 02:43:18.939]  I've told this local talk show host who has a few affiliates nationwide to email Todd Zuranski to make sure that he wrote this article if he doesn't believe me.
[02:43:19.199 --> 02:43:22.183]  And yet, after he takes my call, he says,
[02:43:23.433 --> 02:43:26.615]  It doesn't look like Todd Zuranski actually wrote this article.
[02:43:26.635 --> 02:43:32.498]  So, of course, the next time I called him, I had to shame him and let him know that, yeah, Todd Zuranski did write this article.
[02:43:32.518 --> 02:43:34.699]  You need to email him just to verify.
[02:43:34.759 --> 02:43:36.900]  Sure, and you can always call the source yourself.
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:41.202]  I mean, you don't have to be a big reporter or somebody important to call and verify the sources.
[02:43:41.242 --> 02:43:45.604]  You can do that as readers, as subscribers of any news service.
[02:43:45.704 --> 02:43:47.005]  Chris, good for talking, man.
[02:43:47.025 --> 02:43:47.846]  You have a great weekend.
[02:43:47.886 --> 02:43:48.506]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:49.106 --> 02:43:50.187]  Let's go to New York.
[02:43:50.227 --> 02:43:52.569]  We'll go first to Ron in New York and then Mike in New York.
[02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:53.470]  Ron, how you doing?
[02:43:53.490 --> 02:43:54.450]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:55.051 --> 02:43:56.071]  Hi Jack, how you doing?
[02:43:56.152 --> 02:43:56.532]  Very good.
[02:43:57.152 --> 02:44:02.016]  I want to expand on something I discussed on your show the other day when you had your guest on the offer.
[02:44:02.724 --> 02:44:04.906]  And we were talking about the medical databasing.
[02:44:05.126 --> 02:44:07.208]  I did a little bit more research since the other day.
[02:44:07.248 --> 02:44:13.092]  In fact, I actually called my congressman's office and spoke to his point person on that particular issue.
[02:44:13.712 --> 02:44:21.178]  It turns out that there is a version of the medical database bill, which has just been voted out of Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives.
[02:44:21.698 --> 02:44:27.903]  It's going to come out onto the floor of the full House, and they probably want to take it up before they recess in two weeks, alright?
[02:44:29.238 --> 02:44:31.085]  Now, she was rather informative.
[02:44:31.166 --> 02:44:34.639]  I had asked her, what are the level of privacy protections that are in that bill?
[02:44:35.259 --> 02:44:38.080]  To protect your medical privacy, medical records privacy.
[02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:38.320]  Right.
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:40.741]  And her response was, little to none.
[02:44:41.381 --> 02:44:54.645]  Now, another... And let's remind listeners, this is a bipartisan, privacy-affecting health bill that Hillary Clinton and others are both involved in, again, to just get you one more step to total surveillance.
[02:44:55.025 --> 02:44:55.245]  Right.
[02:44:55.365 --> 02:45:00.747]  As a matter of fact, something I... I brought up some issues on your show the other day, but one thing I didn't bring up is the following.
[02:45:01.303 --> 02:45:09.548]  Being this information will be in the possession of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and there'll be no legal limitations as to how they disseminate the information.
[02:45:09.929 --> 02:45:18.774]  There is every good probability that they will shift it to the Department of Justice NICS system, the system that your name is run through before you purchase a firearm.
[02:45:19.154 --> 02:45:24.498]  And I believe that they'll start trying to utilize it in that way as well, or misutilize it in that way as well.
[02:45:25.277 --> 02:45:30.241]  And also, this will segue into the Employer Verification Act, which is no work list.
[02:45:30.481 --> 02:45:32.983]  You know, Ron, this is what we talked about the other day when you called in.
[02:45:33.203 --> 02:45:46.874]  This is also, and probably most importantly, a eugenics program to weed out the weak and give, you know, through natural selection, all the key jobs to the sons and daughters and nepotism of the elite.
[02:45:47.274 --> 02:45:48.315]  That's correct, Jack.
[02:45:48.455 --> 02:45:54.020]  I've never seen something that could be misapplied and misused in so many different respects.
[02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:58.542]  This thing is a multi-headed monster.
[02:45:58.762 --> 02:46:00.243]  Your listeners have to call.
[02:46:00.283 --> 02:46:01.304]  They have to stand up.
[02:46:01.384 --> 02:46:02.904]  They have to act like men and women.
[02:46:03.345 --> 02:46:06.106]  They have to do something before this thing is put into law.
[02:46:06.126 --> 02:46:08.947]  Give us the exact information, Ron, because you're right.
[02:46:08.967 --> 02:46:12.269]  This is something like about a hundred other things that have to be stopped.
[02:46:12.909 --> 02:46:16.031]  Somebody might really take a niche and put their line in the sand on this.
[02:46:16.071 --> 02:46:17.852]  Give us the exact information we would need.
[02:46:18.212 --> 02:46:28.735]  Unfortunately, the title of the bill, it's a technology enhancement, the Senate version, which is the Hillary Clinton Bill Frist version that was passed in January on the Senate side.
[02:46:29.295 --> 02:46:31.916]  It's the Medical Technology Enhancement Act.
[02:46:31.996 --> 02:46:34.077]  It's a very long title bill.
[02:46:34.697 --> 02:46:41.401]  The one on the House side, I did not get the exact title to it, but basically it's a parallel bill, more or less.
[02:46:42.001 --> 02:46:45.524]  And it was voted out of ways and means this past week.
[02:46:45.684 --> 02:46:52.027]  And anybody in Washington up on the Hill is familiar with it because it's almost a legal landmark.
[02:46:52.067 --> 02:46:57.931]  The first time we would attempt to database every American's medical record with the federal government.
[02:46:58.559 --> 02:46:59.260]  They've got to.
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:00.141]  They've got to speak up.
[02:47:00.181 --> 02:47:00.501]  You can't.
[02:47:00.521 --> 02:47:01.662]  You can't database it.
[02:47:01.682 --> 02:47:03.163]  It's going to be too time-consuming.
[02:47:03.224 --> 02:47:07.428]  Really, the best way to do it, let's just go ahead and I'll take microchips, because that's going to be the best way to do that.
[02:47:07.548 --> 02:47:14.474]  I mean, here's Hillary Clinton and Pilfris, mortal enemies, reaching across the aisle to enslave you.
[02:47:14.774 --> 02:47:21.421]  And please, let me say this to some of your listeners who might buy the hogwash they give you about this database, alright?
[02:47:21.861 --> 02:47:30.784]  The one line they have found in this cloud is they're saying, well, it's a good thing because let's say you're from New York and you go to Florida and you get sick.
[02:47:31.244 --> 02:47:35.826]  Well, your doctor in Florida, you know, will be able to treat you and he'll be able to get you medical information.
[02:47:36.266 --> 02:47:40.108]  Well, that one aspect, small aspect of it might be true.
[02:47:40.588 --> 02:47:46.250]  The fact is there are 99 other diabolical purposes and uses for this system.
[02:47:46.890 --> 02:47:50.293]  In fact, I want you to know this, and you're right, it is bipartisan.
[02:47:50.713 --> 02:47:57.699]  It is a bipartisan attempt to undermine people because in the Ways and Means Committee in the House, that's a Republican majority.
[02:47:58.279 --> 02:48:04.944]  An amendment was brought up before that committee saying, listen, at least allow Americans who don't want to be part of this system to opt out.
[02:48:05.425 --> 02:48:07.887]  That Republican majority in that committee said no.
[02:48:08.945 --> 02:48:10.807]  They said no opt-out of that system.
[02:48:11.188 --> 02:48:15.653]  So you've got to understand, we're between an alligator and a crocodile here.
[02:48:16.073 --> 02:48:17.775]  That's the Republicans and the Democrats.
[02:48:17.916 --> 02:48:25.064]  Hey Ron, thanks for bringing this to our attention and in the next few hours I'm going to talk about bank data being sifted by U.S.
[02:48:25.124 --> 02:48:27.607]  and the secret block terror.
[02:48:28.414 --> 02:48:28.996]  The effect?
[02:48:29.056 --> 02:48:29.637]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:48:29.677 --> 02:48:31.421]  There are no more privacy.
[02:48:31.501 --> 02:48:32.704]  Unless you're George Bush.
[02:48:33.005 --> 02:48:34.768]  And then you don't have to tell anybody anything.
[02:48:35.089 --> 02:48:36.893]  We'll be right back after this to round this whole thing up.
[02:48:36.933 --> 02:48:38.857]  Big finish on the Alex Jones Show coming up right after this.
[02:48:43.562 --> 02:48:50.924]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:51.205 --> 02:48:55.946]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:56.166 --> 02:49:01.808]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:02.048 --> 02:49:06.592]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:06.852 --> 02:49:13.958]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:13.979 --> 02:49:18.522]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.683 --> 02:49:21.205]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:21.425 --> 02:49:28.131]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:49:28.351 --> 02:49:33.614]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:33.634 --> 02:49:34.055]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:42.466 --> 02:49:45.488]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:45.788 --> 02:49:50.732]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:50.972 --> 02:49:55.335]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:55.635 --> 02:50:04.541]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:08.384]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:08.664 --> 02:50:13.687]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:13.988 --> 02:50:20.712]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:21.192 --> 02:50:21.733]  What about you?
[02:50:22.489 --> 02:50:27.853]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:50:27.893 --> 02:50:28.994]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:50:29.074 --> 02:50:30.956]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:50:43.835 --> 02:50:44.156]  I think so.
[02:50:59.056 --> 02:50:59.717]  We're good to go!
[02:51:28.576 --> 02:51:31.679]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:37.706]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:52:04.083 --> 02:52:08.585]  Well, it has been an honor and a privilege sitting in for Alex Jones the last three days.
[02:52:09.025 --> 02:52:11.446]  Great talking to my old friend, the Short Wavers.
[02:52:12.026 --> 02:52:15.787]  We dropped our short a long time ago, but really just an honor being with you.
[02:52:15.807 --> 02:52:29.933]  It's so great to talk to such an intelligent, well-informed audience who's ready to go out there, beat the bushes, pun intended, get on the phone, hammer people, stand up for liberty, truth and justice, expose corruption,
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:34.283]  Just really a great honor to be here with you this weekend.
[02:52:34.423 --> 02:52:39.586]  Looking forward to seeing all of you in Los Angeles that make it out for the big convention.
[02:52:39.706 --> 02:52:42.088]  And I will of course be coming up on my program.
[02:52:42.268 --> 02:52:45.570]  Howard Zinn will be my guest in the second hour of my program.
[02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:48.452]  Immediately following this show at the top of the hour, Propaganda News.
[02:52:48.472 --> 02:52:49.613]  We've got a ton of news to take.
[02:52:49.633 --> 02:52:51.034]  We'll all stick more of your calls.
[02:52:51.935 --> 02:52:53.976]  And I want to let any affiliates know that are out there.
[02:52:53.996 --> 02:52:55.457]  My show is also on satellite.
[02:52:55.497 --> 02:52:57.979]  And I want to thank you brave affiliates for picking up the program.
[02:52:57.999 --> 02:52:59.340]  I want to thank all the sponsors.
[02:53:00.187 --> 02:53:03.168]  for being like-minded and sponsoring this program.
[02:53:03.188 --> 02:53:09.249]  I want to thank all of you who have supported InfoWars and Alex Jones all these years and have made so much of this possible.
[02:53:09.449 --> 02:53:11.730]  We're winning the war against the New World Order.
[02:53:12.010 --> 02:53:21.792]  Okay, it's going to be a long battle, but the victories are coming in, and that's something we always need to remember, that we are not defeated, that we're taking it to them.
[02:53:22.292 --> 02:53:25.393]  Mike, in New York, you are our tail gunner today.
[02:53:25.453 --> 02:53:26.553]  Put something on the record, Mike.
[02:53:26.573 --> 02:53:27.013]  Take us out.
[02:53:27.435 --> 02:53:27.755]  Beautiful.
[02:53:27.775 --> 02:53:35.220]  When you mentioned Wally Karzai there and drug running in Afghanistan, the first person I thought about who could shed some light on all this was Sybil Edmonds.
[02:53:35.521 --> 02:53:35.761]  Yeah.
[02:53:35.841 --> 02:53:42.005]  But then I had to remember the ruling out of King George's Minstrel Supreme Court against the whistleblowers.
[02:53:42.906 --> 02:53:47.289]  Make it very difficult for Sybil to reveal what she knows about the drug trade.
[02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.629]  Right.
[02:53:47.849 --> 02:53:50.671]  Well look, I would Google who killed John O'Neill.
[02:53:51.790 --> 02:53:58.759]  And you're going to get a whole bunch of more evidence and paper trails that go along with this and explain exactly what this story is about.
[02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:02.061]  And that's the best tip I can give you for right now, Mike.
[02:54:02.081 --> 02:54:02.741]  But you know what?
[02:54:02.861 --> 02:54:08.203]  Every time, whether it's Iran-Contra, whether it's, I guess, Vietnam, another great example.
[02:54:08.504 --> 02:54:09.824]  The war in Korea, a good example.
[02:54:09.964 --> 02:54:11.785]  The war in Kosovo, a good example.
[02:54:11.925 --> 02:54:12.925]  The war in the Balkans.
[02:54:13.786 --> 02:54:16.167]  And now the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:54:16.267 --> 02:54:24.630]  It all always seems to lead back to dope and kids and all of these things that the elite take pleasure in unleashing upon the people of the planet.
[02:54:24.890 --> 02:54:27.692]  And a lot of the same players throughout the last 20, 30, 40 years.
[02:54:27.852 --> 02:54:30.533]  Isn't it amazing what these guys can get away with?
[02:54:30.594 --> 02:54:43.341]  I mean, we thought we had the noose around their neck at the Iran-Contra hearings, and then along came guys like John Kerry to be gatekeepers to make sure that nobody is prosecuted, and now we've got Oliver North on Fox News telling us what the truth is.
[02:54:43.381 --> 02:54:44.022]  Give me a break.
[02:54:44.442 --> 02:54:45.282]  Jack, two more comments?
[02:54:45.563 --> 02:54:46.003]  Sure, quick.
[02:54:46.503 --> 02:54:48.404]  Thank you for filling in for Alex this week.
[02:54:50.083 --> 02:54:51.004]  Well, let Alex know.
[02:54:51.844 --> 02:54:53.445]  If you like what I did, let Alex know.
[02:54:53.465 --> 02:54:54.126]  Maybe I'll be back.
[02:54:54.246 --> 02:54:55.367]  Well, that's the second comment.
[02:54:55.787 --> 02:54:57.168]  Alex, Charlie, go get them.
[02:54:57.508 --> 02:54:58.069]  That's right.
[02:54:58.769 --> 02:54:59.570]  Don't worry about it.
[02:54:59.830 --> 02:55:00.870]  We're not shy about that.
[02:55:01.111 --> 02:55:03.732]  Hey, I want to thank all the callers, and again, thank the network.
[02:55:03.792 --> 02:55:05.133]  John, you did a great job today.
[02:55:05.153 --> 02:55:06.354]  Again, it was a pleasure sitting in.
[02:55:06.374 --> 02:55:07.775]  We've got two more hours to go.
[02:55:07.795 --> 02:55:09.897]  We've got a ton more news to cover.
[02:55:09.937 --> 02:55:13.899]  Some of the things we're going to cover is bank data sifted by the U.S.
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:15.821]  in secret to block terror.
[02:55:16.241 --> 02:55:19.323]  We're going to talk more about these phony chemical weapons that were found.
[02:55:19.343 --> 02:55:24.566]  We're going to talk about Tom Ridge's decades of war for the War on Terror.
[02:55:24.586 --> 02:55:32.151]  We're going to talk about propaganda and newspapers now actually rejecting some of the White House's propaganda.
[02:55:32.731 --> 02:55:36.813]  And also, I didn't get to this, social isolation growing within the United States.
[02:55:36.853 --> 02:55:38.854]  How we can defeat that and expose that as well.
[02:55:38.874 --> 02:55:39.875]  You've been a great audience.
[02:55:40.035 --> 02:55:41.156]  You have a great weekend.
[02:55:41.316 --> 02:55:42.757]  Hope to see a lot of you in L.A.
