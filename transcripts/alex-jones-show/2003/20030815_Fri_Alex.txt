[00:00:02.978 --> 00:00:06.241]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.411]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:17.193]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:18.995]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:20.396]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:21.497]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:26.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.003]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:40.109]  That's right, my friends.
[00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.951]  And you are my dear friends.
[00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:47.834]  I'm Alex Jones, and
[00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:53.141]  Here I am, thought I'd take off a day or two with my wife and family.
[00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.503]  I haven't had a vacation in a couple of years.
[00:00:56.524 --> 00:01:04.870]  And I am joining you via cell phone to talk about the power being turned off from Detroit to Toronto to New York City.
[00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:12.436]  It is August 14, 2003 and we're seeing a lot of diversions.
[00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:14.257]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Colby Bryant,
[00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:22.513]  A lot of different things going on, but when I first heard about this today, the power outage, I wasn't sure what was going on.
[00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:32.416]  Then I watched the news and the spin and the unified propaganda line across all four big networks, cable and broadcast TV.
[00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:35.397]  This thing stinks to high heaven, as they say.
[00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:40.308]  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:47.049]  So I want to talk about the situation with the power being turned off.
[00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:55.690]  And then I want to talk a little bit about the supposed missile story and all the holes in that.
[00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.392]  And then Warren Buffett being signed on to Arnold's election campaign for the governorship
[00:02:06.113 --> 00:02:10.375]  of the cesspool new world order state of California.
[00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:17.339]  So that's just some of what we'll be covering and then we're going to get back into all the news and the stuff that really matters.
[00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:30.545]  But bottom line, whether this is an accident or because there's not enough transmission lines or the globalists get it, they're certainly using it as a way for more federal control and
[00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:38.675]  Dispatching anti-terrorism teams with fully automatic weapons to keep everybody safe at all the New York and Detroit landmarks.
[00:02:40.697 --> 00:02:44.339]  And we know that the power business is a big scam in this country.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.324]  We know that Governor Great Davis would buy a megawatt for $137 and sell it back to the companies for $1.
[00:02:52.354 --> 00:03:02.821]  We know that they're trying to buy up city and county-owned utilities that have supplied power and done a great job for decades doing everything on big unified systems that can be turned off with a flip of a switch.
[00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:11.987]  They want dozens of states across the country in blocks to be under the control of monopolies in their area, or at least oligopolies.
[00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:14.308]  Just several companies controlling it.
[00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.370]  And this, more than anything, illustrates
[00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:27.715]  How vulnerable we are in this cashless society control grid, in these compact cities, the amazing control they have over us.
[00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:29.215]  We don't know where our water comes from.
[00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:34.098]  We don't know where our power comes from.
[00:03:35.138 --> 00:03:40.861]  We don't know where the steaks in the grocery store come from, or the corn in the tortilla shells.
[00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:51.388]  It's eugenically engineered, the oil, the way it's brought to us is through a scam, what's happening with the vaccines, what's going into the water with the fluoride.
[00:03:51.888 --> 00:03:59.633]  The globalists are a bunch of eugenics-promoting control freaks, a bunch of neo-feudalists, feudal lords, who just enjoy controlling us.
[00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:10.941]  And the message out of all this is, you're insecure, you don't have any power, but don't worry, the government's going to save you, we're here to control things, and oh, we need to force everybody onto alternative energy.
[00:04:11.613 --> 00:04:12.754]  That was the big message here.
[00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.034]  We've got to go to wind power.
[00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.855]  We've got to go to all these other systems.
[00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:19.037]  You've got to pay more taxes for your energy use.
[00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:21.498]  Big government's the answer.
[00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:24.299]  More of the same's the answer to fix this problem.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.162]  Now the power may have, you know, they try to send too much power down too few lines.
[00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:29.862]  Maybe that's true.
[00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:35.945]  But the bottom line fact is they're using this to push for more government control.
[00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.072]  They're using this to dominate humanity.
[00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:46.015]  And the globalists cannot be trusted to carry out the garbage, much less run our lives.
[00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:52.558]  And this just shows, as they centralize power more and more, what their mistakes can do.
[00:04:53.619 --> 00:05:00.942]  And by the way, deregulation has not been deregulation or privatization.
[00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:03.524]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.544 --> 00:05:04.144]  We'll talk about it.
[00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:18.511]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:23.517]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:23.737 --> 00:05:29.405]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:30.345]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:48.772]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:05:48.972 --> 00:05:55.733]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:07.718]  That's 800-481-9858.
[00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:15.884]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:22.421]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.102]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:24.322 --> 00:07:31.585]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:36.027]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:38.629]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:43.513]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:50.639]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:54.102]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[00:07:54.362 --> 00:07:57.765]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:15.582]  Big Brother.
[00:08:16.223 --> 00:08:17.284]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:19.106]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.746 --> 00:08:20.547]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:22.109]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:26.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.075 --> 00:08:31.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.427 --> 00:08:41.447]  Alright, welcome folks.
[00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:47.613]  Actually, it's live from South Texas on the road here, joining our giant
[00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:51.418]  Audience all over the country via cell phone.
[00:08:51.978 --> 00:08:53.379]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:59.221]  And there's a bunch of different key pieces of news and information we need to discuss.
[00:09:00.742 --> 00:09:09.285]  One of the big news stories, of course, is the power outage that took place on Thursday.
[00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:16.559]  And that is the situation with the power being off from Toronto to Detroit, Michigan.
[00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:19.082]  That's Toronto, Canada to Detroit, Michigan.
[00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:31.794]  New York, New York, the city of New York, surrounding areas, only power back on in spotty areas in major metropolitan areas by Thursday night.
[00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:47.476]  And we heard that all of this would be stopped if we had privatization and deregulation, but the globalists are great at labeling conservatism, being anti-gun, open borders, and for massive regulation.
[00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:48.576]  That's not real conservatism.
[00:09:49.577 --> 00:09:51.198]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.360]  They call deregulation and privatization
[00:09:55.257 --> 00:09:56.598]  They just label it differently.
[00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:00.421]  It's not really deregulation or privatization.
[00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:05.706]  It's monopoly or monopoly capitalism or crony capitalism.
[00:10:05.766 --> 00:10:22.140]  It's organized crime where they go around and force cities and counties and others and even smaller private power companies to sell out to the big conglomerates and then they run scams with the governors and regional leaders and with the presidents, whether it's Bill Clinton and
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:35.447]  Bill Richardson, or the guy they had removed, Mr. Ron Brown, or if it's George W. Bush and his energy secretary.
[00:10:36.487 --> 00:10:40.589]  Energy is a big scam in this country and worldwide.
[00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.971]  And we've seen this with Enron and with many of the other companies.
[00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:49.574]  We've broken a lot of stories on this show about the situation.
[00:10:50.885 --> 00:11:03.352]  When I found out that the power had gone off in the East Coast and then all the way over into Detroit, Michigan and up into Canada, I thought to myself, well, I've talked to a lot of engineers, a lot of people that work for power companies,
[00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:10.463]  They said they built bigger, larger power companies, but they do not have the transmission lines to actually get the power there.
[00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:16.326]  When people use a lot of that power during the summer months now, it can cause problems.
[00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:21.508]  So they can deliver the power to the lines, but the lines can't deliver the power to the people.
[00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:22.649]  So that may be the case.
[00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:30.273]  But then, within an hour of hearing of the story breaking, of watching all four big news channels,
[00:11:32.837 --> 00:11:35.040]  Again, these terrorists are up to their same activities.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:49.515]  Whether the globalists turn the power off, or whether it went off because the transmission lines aren't large enough, it doesn't really matter because the same script across the board
[00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:58.764]  On all the channels, the same words, in the same order, and you all saw it develop as well, folks, just use your thinking caps, was the same script.
[00:11:59.264 --> 00:12:18.549]  Big government can save you, we need to have more regulation, make you go to all these alternative forms of energy, all these new taxes, you're all weak and pathetic, but the government can step up to the plate, and President Bush can, and Hillary can, and Mayor Bloomberg can, and, you know, government's going to hold your hand, you're just lucky we're here.
[00:12:19.466 --> 00:12:22.028]  And then there's a whole other discussion here of how dependent we are.
[00:12:22.048 --> 00:12:30.936]  I mean, take these big metropolis-style cities, these mega-opolises, as they call them.
[00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:33.518]  I mean, people are totally dependent.
[00:12:33.538 --> 00:12:36.220]  There's two or three days of food on the shelves.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.842]  Most of the food in the cupboards isn't storable.
[00:12:39.162 --> 00:12:41.644]  The stuff that's in the refrigerator is going to spoil in a couple days.
[00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.407]  And where's our society going?
[00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.188]  More towards the urbanization.
[00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:48.370]  More towards that centralization.
[00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:53.311]  And this makes us totally dependent on the government and the people that run government.
[00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:56.393]  And none of this happens in a vacuum.
[00:12:57.113 --> 00:12:58.014]  It's all connected.
[00:12:58.054 --> 00:12:59.535]  We have to look at who runs the government.
[00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:00.876]  We have to look at what they've done in the past.
[00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:03.418]  We know they've done biological testing on us.
[00:13:03.478 --> 00:13:05.319]  We know they've carried out terrorist attacks.
[00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.681]  We know they see us as little creatures in a petri dish.
[00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:13.244]  And it's like a scientist examines an amoeba on a slide.
[00:13:13.264 --> 00:13:17.667]  The globalists examine our societies and manipulate us with the mass media.
[00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:19.643]  I mean, they're controlling us.
[00:13:20.403 --> 00:13:24.965]  And to see them get all this police state gas mileage and say, well, it's not terrorism.
[00:13:25.345 --> 00:13:26.765]  First, it was, we all know it was terrorism.
[00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:27.986]  Could have been another terrorist attack.
[00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.747]  They got an hour of that propaganda out and said, oh, no.
[00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.167]  Well, we don't think it's that.
[00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.348]  In fact, it's not that.
[00:13:33.428 --> 00:13:43.412]  But still, we've dispatched Homeland Security and we've dispatched heavily armed teams to all the key infrastructure points in case terrorists try to strike.
[00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:53.641]  And you know, all that sounds well and good until you realize, again, who's teared up the terrorism in the past, how the globalists say they'll use crisis to get their aims.
[00:13:54.142 --> 00:14:00.992]  I watched Bill Richardson on Larry King Live Thursday night and he said,
[00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:17.268]  That we need to use this disaster, use this problem to get so-called energy reform, that's government control, handing control to private corporations in furtherance of privatization and the so-called deregulation.
[00:14:17.288 --> 00:14:27.331]  And he said we need to force all these new taxes on people, make them go to all these so-called alternative fuels that could be legitimate, but the way they're bringing them forward are scams.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.141]  It was incredible.
[00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:32.964]  And you're saying, wait a minute, Bill Richardson's against privatization and deregulation.
[00:14:33.044 --> 00:14:33.324]  No.
[00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:36.526]  No, this is how they semantically manipulate.
[00:14:36.967 --> 00:14:48.196]  They'll have the liberals and the so-called conservatives come together and have some fake argument about the different ways to build the power infrastructure in the U.S.
[00:14:48.236 --> 00:14:51.578]  now that we need to because we're taking on all these third-world populations.
[00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:56.262]  And how do we upgrade just the older systems that are falling apart?
[00:14:56.974 --> 00:15:03.184]  And so Richardson will say, well, I'm for more government control and more funding and more taxes and more regulation.
[00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:06.801]  Well, then you read over the years what he's proposed.
[00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:11.644]  It's actually just giving money to the same corporations that he's against, quote, privatizing to.
[00:15:11.984 --> 00:15:13.105]  So it's all just semantical.
[00:15:13.405 --> 00:15:17.428]  And the so-called conservatives say, no, the answer is deregulation and privatization.
[00:15:17.588 --> 00:15:18.429]  It's all the same thing.
[00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:28.796]  They take our tax money, build this infrastructure, hand it over to centralized groups that are over dozens of states and in several blocks, and then jack up the prices on us.
[00:15:29.276 --> 00:15:34.660]  I mean, they'll do anything they can to buy up your private utilities that aren't part of the larger conglomerates.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.260]  They're smaller.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:45.266]  They'll do anything under the sun to force you to sell your city or county-owned utilities that are doing a good job and delivering power cheaply.
[00:15:46.047 --> 00:15:49.009]  In Austin, Texas, we have a government-owned system.
[00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:51.649]  Uh, and of course, it was fascist too.
[00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:56.395]  I mean, the province went to private groups, but still, it was cheap.
[00:15:56.996 --> 00:16:02.182]  As soon as they brought the so-called privatization in, the power bills went way, way, way up.
[00:16:03.023 --> 00:16:06.768]  They had their so-called public-private nuclear power plant.
[00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:08.290]  Comanche Peak in South Texas.
[00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:14.288]  And everybody in the state pays for that, and if it doesn't produce a tenth of the power, they claimed it would.
[00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:21.131]  So it's just, it's just limited capitalism, crony capitalism, whatever you want to call it.
[00:16:21.451 --> 00:16:24.653]  I just call it criminal corporatism all over the place.
[00:16:24.753 --> 00:16:29.455]  And out of this now, they had a big energy bill stalled in the House.
[00:16:30.214 --> 00:16:39.160]  In the Congress, and now they were on TV saying, well, thanks to this, we'll get the new increased funding for energy passed, when all we really needed was a free market.
[00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:47.606]  And that means not using government to go in and take over private companies that are sending people good power at good prices.
[00:16:48.687 --> 00:16:54.271]  Again, private corporations use the power of government to go in and take over their competition.
[00:16:55.112 --> 00:16:56.032]  This is what they do.
[00:16:56.112 --> 00:16:57.073]  It's not free market.
[00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:09.910]  But again, all that aside, look at how dependent we are, look at how non-self-sufficient we are, look at how we're at the mercy of government, and how we're like these little ants
[00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:21.430]  Remember when you were a kid, your parents would buy you the little set of ants you'd put in a little sand container that was see-through, and you'd watch the ants build their little colony?
[00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.351]  That's basically what the globalists have done.
[00:17:23.371 --> 00:17:26.193]  They've got us in these compact cities, totally controlled.
[00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:27.914]  They brag about their social engineering.
[00:17:28.254 --> 00:17:34.258]  They're doing everything they can to force people off their rural land, off their ranches, off their farms, into these compact cities.
[00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.079]  And it's horrible.
[00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:38.080]  We need to be educated on this fact.
[00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:54.313]  Now, one of the other big issues here that is very, very important is, again, the government last year got caught putting out fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria to get the administration's approval rating up.
[00:17:54.353 --> 00:18:01.396]  When you hear get the administration's approval rating up, translate that into get people back behind the New World Order agenda.
[00:18:02.003 --> 00:18:03.144]  That George Bush is pushing.
[00:18:03.164 --> 00:18:05.986]  And again, it wouldn't matter if it was Al Gore or John Kerry.
[00:18:06.006 --> 00:18:06.546]  They're puppets.
[00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:10.308]  But now we hear arms suspect hated America.
[00:18:10.869 --> 00:18:14.471]  Arms dealer hated America with this missile story.
[00:18:15.152 --> 00:18:20.355]  And when you read into the articles that we posted on PrisonPlanet.com and other websites, InfoWars.com,
[00:18:21.007 --> 00:18:27.251]  When you read into the meat of what they're really saying here, past just the headlines, this was a sting operation.
[00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:35.737]  They had cases in England where the government was trying to sell plastic missiles to any moron on the street.
[00:18:36.578 --> 00:18:47.445]  They're just out there everywhere trying to provocateur, trying to find patsies, trying to find these zealots out there who will then talk about how they want to carry out a terrorist attack and bust them.
[00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.572]  And, again, this government tells you they're trying to stop terrorists.
[00:18:51.932 --> 00:19:02.337]  This is all about creating the illusion that they're there protecting us, we're under attack, so we all have this beehive or this anthill mentality.
[00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:05.639]  And that's exactly what they're doing here.
[00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:09.021]  And you look at this case, it's all about the fear-mongering.
[00:19:09.101 --> 00:19:16.985]  See, we've got to have more terrorism funding, we've got to have a bigger police state, we've got to take more of your rights, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:18.791]  But where are the terrorists?
[00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:19.631]  They're non-existent.
[00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:23.492]  Every time you track down Al-Qaeda, it turns out to be CIA, Mossad, or MI6.
[00:19:23.773 --> 00:19:26.013]  That's British intelligence.
[00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:35.115]  And so when the people that we've caught carrying out terror, dozens of times, in this country and other countries, stand up and tell us, oh look, we caught a terrorist.
[00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:39.517]  He was trying to sell Stinger missiles, or these Russian missiles, similar to Stinger.
[00:19:40.057 --> 00:19:41.217]  It just doesn't hold any water.
[00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:45.840]  It's more fear-mongering so they can pose and play the part of your savior.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:20:00.122]  And then we have this announcement that Warren Buffett, the big globalist, has been tapped by Arnold Schwarzenegger as his economic advisor.
[00:20:00.162 --> 00:20:02.183]  And oh, this is the last straw.
[00:20:02.363 --> 00:20:04.843]  All opposition will now crumble.
[00:20:04.943 --> 00:20:06.284]  Oh, Warren Buffett's so good.
[00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:07.744]  And then they point out,
[00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:17.727]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:20:17.947 --> 00:20:20.190]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:20:20.391 --> 00:20:26.760]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.741]  I think so.
[00:20:47.295 --> 00:20:48.716]  Hi, Jack Rauner with Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[00:21:14.102 --> 00:21:15.423]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[00:21:15.643 --> 00:21:18.365]  The Nasdaq was down 22% for the year?
[00:21:18.785 --> 00:21:20.146]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:22.428]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[00:21:23.101 --> 00:21:28.462]  Unfortunately for many of us, the paper markets have already wiped out life savings with no hope of recovery.
[00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:29.962]  Don't let this happen to you.
[00:21:30.262 --> 00:21:32.083]  Call Midas Resources today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:32.143 --> 00:21:36.904]  Gold Spot at that time was trading at about $275.
[00:21:37.104 --> 00:21:40.505]  It is now up dramatically and looking very bullish.
[00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:45.626]  We recommend it at that time to put a significant portion of your assets into the gold and silver collector coins.
[00:21:45.886 --> 00:21:47.286]  That advice still stands.
[00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.548]  Call Midas today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.388 --> 00:21:54.111]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[00:21:54.391 --> 00:21:57.033]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[00:21:57.354 --> 00:22:02.297]  The time to move to hard assets is now, before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[00:22:02.538 --> 00:22:03.899]  Protect your financial holdings.
[00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:05.660]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:09.926]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:12.489]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:22:12.589 --> 00:22:13.290]  You heard that right.
[00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.853]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:16.954]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:22:17.194 --> 00:22:18.516]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:20.298]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:22:20.538 --> 00:22:23.301]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:24.002]  The procedures
[00:22:24.002 --> 00:22:27.163]  It's easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[00:22:27.363 --> 00:22:28.784]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:41.648]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:46.270]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than ten years.
[00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.830]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.991]  Fight back America!
[00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:49.951]  Stop the fraud!

[00:23:05.016 --> 00:23:06.617]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[00:23:10.296 --> 00:23:14.801]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:23:15.142 --> 00:23:19.247]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:23:19.527 --> 00:23:20.088]  We listened.
[00:23:20.388 --> 00:23:25.374]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:26.135]  We listened.
[00:23:26.535 --> 00:23:29.559]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:30.500]  We listened.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.043]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:23:35.403 --> 00:23:35.904]  We listened.
[00:23:36.244 --> 00:23:41.488]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:23:41.908 --> 00:23:43.249]  Again, we listened.
[00:23:43.629 --> 00:23:51.015]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:23:51.395 --> 00:23:55.278]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at
[00:24:00.243 --> 00:24:01.867]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:03.532]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.781]  All right, folks.
[00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:26.422]  Cut short by the last break.
[00:24:26.442 --> 00:24:34.427]  What I'm trying to say is about the Warren Buffett situation, the big insurance magnate, one of the richest men on paper in America.
[00:24:34.447 --> 00:24:38.089]  He's actually lower ranked, lower run compared to a lot of the top globalists.
[00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.652]  This guy has now joined Arnie and says they're good buddies from the past.
[00:24:43.712 --> 00:24:46.034]  Well, yeah, he's another New World Order bohemian grovite.
[00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.612]  from up there in Nebraska.
[00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:53.936]  He's now going to be Arnold's advisor in California on the economy.
[00:24:53.976 --> 00:24:55.978]  And oh, they're saying, oh, this is such a great choice.
[00:24:56.338 --> 00:24:57.259]  This is so wonderful.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.843]  Then they go ahead and point out that he's a big Democrat and that he'll make the tough choices.
[00:25:01.903 --> 00:25:05.867]  He'll raise taxes and cut programs.
[00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:07.128]  We'll see.
[00:25:07.148 --> 00:25:08.409]  This is what they're preparing us for.
[00:25:09.142 --> 00:25:35.287]  In the real political system, they socialize you, that is, they train you, they domesticate you, they get you addicted to government programs, they grow the size of the government, and then they blow out the government, bankrupt the states, the federal government, and transfer ownership and control to the private, tiny cabal of private corporations that are not free market, that are organized crime syndicates.
[00:25:36.347 --> 00:25:37.328]  But, I mean, here it is again.
[00:25:37.348 --> 00:25:38.808]  Not only is Arnold pro-abortion,
[00:25:39.423 --> 00:26:00.639]  Not only is Arnold vehemently anti-gun for banning whole classes of guns, not only is he for homosexuals marrying, homosexuals marrying and then adopting children, Arnold is appointing a bunch of Democrats to his gubernatorial cabinet to be his advisors.
[00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:02.320]  And what are the neo-cons?
[00:26:03.408 --> 00:26:06.571]  On top radio, on the news saying they are falling over themselves.
[00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:09.873]  They are worshipping him, Bush, over and over again from the ranch.
[00:26:10.914 --> 00:26:11.875]  Who knows what they're plotting.
[00:26:12.295 --> 00:26:15.958]  Now that Crawford, Texas is saying he supports Arnold.
[00:26:15.998 --> 00:26:26.327]  He's a, would make a great, a good governor, but not mentioning any other names of any other candidates who, by the way, have conservative records, some of them, who actually were behind getting the recall through.
[00:26:26.787 --> 00:26:32.512]  I'm all for getting rid of Davis, but not replacing him with somebody like
[00:26:33.172 --> 00:26:34.373]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:44.960]  But again, this just shows the amazing double standard of this system, where they will attack Mel Gibson for his film, The Passion, when there's nothing anti-Semitic in it.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:52.824]  But then somebody who says he, quote, admires Adolf Hitler and hangs out with Nazis of this day, like Kurt Voltheim, who just so happens to be the former head of the UN.
[00:26:53.285 --> 00:26:55.086]  See how the left and right are all together on this?
[00:26:55.546 --> 00:26:59.849]  You're a real Nazi, they love you, but if you're a patriot, they can label you as a Nazi.
[00:27:00.675 --> 00:27:01.976]  And we've got to rebuke this.
[00:27:02.016 --> 00:27:02.976]  We've got to stand up to this.
[00:27:03.016 --> 00:27:03.957]  We've got to say no to this.
[00:27:04.497 --> 00:27:10.840]  And just back to the power outages all over the East, from Detroit, Michigan, to Toronto, Canada, down to New York City.
[00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:14.122]  This just shows what centralization of power is all about.
[00:27:14.843 --> 00:27:20.586]  We should have local power companies privately owned for every state and for every county and city.
[00:27:20.906 --> 00:27:22.126]  And that's what we had in the past.
[00:27:22.287 --> 00:27:24.988]  And that's why we weren't like these third world countries that were always losing their power.
[00:27:26.255 --> 00:27:33.881]  But in places where you have third world countries, or where you have Russia or China or any command and control despot running things, you're going to have power outages.
[00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:35.603]  It's just part of living in a third world country.
[00:27:35.963 --> 00:27:46.792]  Police in black ski masks, helicopters in the sky surveilling us, police and military merging, high taxation and regulation, you can be secretly arrested and never seen again.
[00:27:47.192 --> 00:27:48.794]  This is all part of living in a third world country.
[00:27:49.394 --> 00:27:54.098]  And the other part of living in a third world country is not having utilities you can depend on.
[00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:58.611]  So, being in a police state, being in the New World Order means a lot of things.
[00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:09.441]  And one of the things it means is being abused and being totally dependent on a government that routinely will turn your power and your water off just to let you know who's the boss, and then make you feel more and more dependent.
[00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:13.585]  So the answer is, get self-sufficient and get away from this corrupting system.
[00:28:14.306 --> 00:28:19.031]  Before we end this segment and go back to our regularly scheduled show,
[00:28:19.853 --> 00:28:26.083]  And not myself out here on a rare respite one or two days of vacation via cell phone joining you.
[00:28:27.465 --> 00:28:32.252]  I want to challenge everybody to get my videos, to get my book,
[00:28:33.374 --> 00:28:39.521]  Uh, and to get the new book by Paul Joseph Watson, Order Out of Chaos, that covers elite sponsored terrorists and the New World Order.
[00:28:39.862 --> 00:28:41.784]  Get behind people that support freedom.
[00:28:42.064 --> 00:28:43.967]  Get behind people that support you and your family.
[00:28:44.247 --> 00:28:48.352]  Get behind radio stations and networks and sponsors that support freedom.
[00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:49.934]  And we're going to have a freer country.
[00:28:50.434 --> 00:28:50.895]  And believe me,
[00:28:51.576 --> 00:28:52.336]  And a freer world.
[00:28:52.456 --> 00:29:02.019]  If we weren't here fighting the New World Order, if we weren't here involved, if you weren't out there on the front lines educating people and supporting shows like this one, we'd be in a lot worse situation right now.
[00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:03.499]  That's what history proves.
[00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:07.180]  Despots want total control, and they want it now.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.901]  So again, please keep spreading the word about the show.
[00:29:09.921 --> 00:29:14.922]  I want to thank all our affiliates, our sponsors, number one, our listeners, the great folks around the show.
[00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:18.623]  And be sure and visit nfoawards.com and prisonplanet.com.

[00:29:22.805 --> 00:29:23.745]  And they all do one thing.
[00:29:23.785 --> 00:29:27.608]  They spread the word, they open eyes, they unlock minds to history.
[00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:31.211]  And what the centralization of power actually does.
[00:29:32.652 --> 00:29:35.414]  So again folks, God bless you all.
[00:29:36.435 --> 00:29:38.877]  More of the show coming up in another two and a half hours.
[00:29:38.897 --> 00:29:42.300]  A lot of great calls, guests, information, news, you name it.
[00:29:42.984 --> 00:29:48.529]  And again, we only cover a tiny fraction of the stuff that's going on out there, so please visit InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:53.113]  And remember, giving government control of your life only ensures that you'll be abused.
[00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:01.821]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:03.903]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.943 --> 00:30:07.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.552 --> 00:30:12.352]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:12.533 --> 00:30:13.133]  I mean, real.
[00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:18.174]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:18.494 --> 00:30:19.354]  Probably never, right?
[00:30:19.614 --> 00:30:23.115]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I'll do it for you.
[00:30:23.135 --> 00:30:23.935]  1-866-YO-COBRA.
[00:30:24.236 --> 00:30:30.097]  That's 1-866-962-6272, or visit CobraHead.com.
[00:30:32.338 --> 00:30:37.379]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:38.152 --> 00:30:40.513]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:43.035]  All right, folks.
[00:30:43.195 --> 00:30:49.559]  Jeffrey, John, Larry, Dennis, Ron, others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.243]  And I do want to get your response to the American Bar Association saying lawyers are now going to tattle on you.
[00:30:56.263 --> 00:30:58.004]  You're not going to have any attorney-client privilege.
[00:30:58.864 --> 00:31:00.325]  They've called for getting rid of juries.
[00:31:00.345 --> 00:31:03.187]  I mean, you talk about tyranny, it's happening.
[00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.731]  There's a call to ban .50 caliber rifles.
[00:31:06.871 --> 00:31:08.712]  Bush moving forward with the assault weapons ban.
[00:31:10.753 --> 00:31:13.033]  This and a lot more coming up, so definitely stay with us.
[00:31:13.053 --> 00:31:20.356]  We're about, in a few minutes, going to have a little five minute update from Joyce Riley on several big stories that she's been breaking and expanding.
[00:31:21.457 --> 00:31:23.898]  Expanding on news that's also been brought up by the mainstream media.
[00:31:25.373 --> 00:31:30.778]  Before we do that, folks, you need to go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:31:31.178 --> 00:31:35.222]  You need to order Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism and the New World Order.
[00:31:35.522 --> 00:31:38.945]  It's a book I have published because it needed to be seen.
[00:31:39.686 --> 00:31:43.189]  It's 334 pages long by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:49.075]  It covers September 11th, British sponsored terrorism in their own country and abroad.
[00:31:49.635 --> 00:31:51.637]  The Patriot Act, Homeland Security,
[00:31:52.596 --> 00:31:55.579]  And a bunch of other facets of the New World Order, my friends.
[00:31:55.719 --> 00:32:00.562]  It is very in-depth, very well written, very well documented.
[00:32:00.662 --> 00:32:01.903]  It is an amazing book.
[00:32:02.404 --> 00:32:02.684]  Only $19.95.
[00:32:02.724 --> 00:32:07.147]  And if you get a second book, it's only $11.95.
[00:32:08.268 --> 00:32:10.510]  So that's $31.90 for two books.
[00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.031]  $19.95 for one book.
[00:32:12.471 --> 00:32:12.772]  Order.
[00:32:13.272 --> 00:32:14.353]  Order out of chaos.
[00:32:14.893 --> 00:32:15.674]  Right now, folks.
[00:32:16.074 --> 00:32:17.135]  My new film is out.
[00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:34.087]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement, it covers dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism, Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, ports inoculations, concentration camps, foreign troops, government-run white slavery rings, it gets into the gun control, it gets into just so many facets.
[00:32:34.107 --> 00:32:36.428]  There's no way to describe all the stuff in these books and films.
[00:32:36.448 --> 00:32:44.851]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny is about September 11th, frankly our best film, just for the general public, you know, it looks like Discovery Channel or something.
[00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:46.932]  Now, you need to have these videos.
[00:32:47.052 --> 00:32:49.952]  You need to go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:32:50.433 --> 00:32:54.554]  And remember, your purchase of the films or books supports this show and what we're doing.

[00:33:06.698 --> 00:33:09.799]  The videos are all over two hours long, $25.95.
[00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:12.099]  Order three or more of any of the nine films.
[00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:13.320]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.844]  So don't wait folks, get the videos today!
[00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:21.847]  The toll free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:45.057]  That's 888-253-3139, or you can also write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:33:47.198 --> 00:33:49.020]  Don't wait, don't procrastinate.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.782]  The new film, the new book, is now shipping, folks.
[00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:53.929]  Captain Joyce Riley.
[00:33:54.189 --> 00:33:56.470]  Joyce, I know you called in about the new Air Force uniforms.
[00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.971]  They've gone over to the Black Berets a few years ago.
[00:33:59.011 --> 00:34:18.196]  This was admitted to get us ready to merge into a multinational NATO-slash-UN force, but I gotta stop because I was wanting to get you up on the show anyways to talk about... Anyways, despite that, to talk about... Well, it came out in the mainstream news that the father of one of the people that's died from this disease that liquefies the organs
[00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.937]  Um, it has nothing to do, obviously, with pneumonia, as they say.
[00:34:22.957 --> 00:34:27.545]  It's like being hit by a truck and saying you, you know, you died by being shot by a BB gun or something.
[00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:29.662]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:34:30.662 --> 00:34:35.524]  They're out here now saying that you had the father on, got even more revelations out.
[00:34:35.564 --> 00:34:36.465]  Now others are dying.
[00:34:36.705 --> 00:34:41.087]  They got hospitals in Germany full of these guys, turning into puddles of goo, basically.
[00:34:41.827 --> 00:34:47.550]  And his son had told him right before he got sick that we're hauling toxic stuff.
[00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.672]  We're hauling something classified to Saddam's bunkers.
[00:34:51.052 --> 00:34:57.655]  Then you talked about an article yesterday where somebody in the CIA leaked it, that they were trying to plant weapons of mass destruction.
[00:34:58.235 --> 00:35:01.138]  But that the convoy got bombed in friendly fire.
[00:35:01.958 --> 00:35:10.705]  By the grace of God, everything the globalists are doing keeps getting blown wide open, thanks to this network and shows like yours, and good people that are out there.
[00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:13.588]  So, Joyce, give us a quick overview of the different stuff that's going on.
[00:35:14.268 --> 00:35:14.969]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:35:15.049 --> 00:35:19.733]  I'll tell you, we're getting more and more people from the inside that are now reporting to us what is happening.
[00:35:20.253 --> 00:35:24.757]  And I think what we can do at this point in time is realize that there is a massive program underway
[00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:32.085]  Of course, to probably plant these weapons of mass destruction, as they've been trying to do this for quite a while.
[00:35:32.525 --> 00:35:40.809]  They've had a number of incidents that have occurred, and it is my belief that that is what the President meant when he said, we will bring the weapons.
[00:35:41.029 --> 00:35:48.974]  Well, I've heard their mouthpieces, the neocons laughing that Limbaugh and Hannity, the quote, they've already got them, they're going to roll them out right before the election.
[00:35:49.134 --> 00:35:51.575]  I've heard them laugh and brag and say it.
[00:35:53.675 --> 00:35:54.436]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:35:55.037 --> 00:35:59.863]  And I think that they were correct when they said we will find weapons of mass destruction.
[00:35:59.883 --> 00:36:00.984]  There is no doubt about that.
[00:36:01.044 --> 00:36:01.825]  We will find them.
[00:36:01.885 --> 00:36:03.847]  Well, I think they've already found them.
[00:36:03.888 --> 00:36:13.159]  What I think is happening here is that people like Josh Nushi, and what an incredible young man he was, his family is so proud of him, but yet they have so many questions right now.
[00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.906]  And wanting to know why he died.
[00:36:15.986 --> 00:36:26.335]  Now, the most, I think, significant thing in this case, to make any prior military or prior service person question, is the fact that you have a 20-year-old young man who was on this secret haul.
[00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:31.119]  He was hauling these toxins on the 26th of June.
[00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:40.026]  He began the mission, which was allegedly classified, or which the family said he could not tell them what it was, of the confidential nature of it.
[00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.611]  He becomes ill on the 30th.
[00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:51.937]  On the 1st of July, the military made him 100% medically retired.
[00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:59.842]  I mean, they retired a 20-year-old kid on a respirator in Germany without telling his parents anything.
[00:37:00.542 --> 00:37:08.167]  So this story has gotten more press only because of one journalist that says she's not going to change her story, though everybody else is.
[00:37:08.723 --> 00:37:13.129]  We've now got 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th that have been reported now.
[00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.652]  Deaths are being reported all over the country.
[00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:20.158]  And there's hundreds that are sick and it just so happens they were all right around this area.
[00:37:20.859 --> 00:37:24.584]  Joyce, we've caught them saying that trucks were pumping up dirigibles.
[00:37:25.228 --> 00:37:26.228]  We're sold by the British.
[00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:28.750]  They knew exactly what it was out of the Jane's Dictionary.
[00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.771]  They said for months it is Mobile Weapons Labs.
[00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:36.133]  They claim the Niger document that was showing uranium transfers from Africa.
[00:37:36.393 --> 00:37:37.933]  Turns out that was made out of whole cloth.
[00:37:38.334 --> 00:37:40.735]  They've been caught with fake dossiers written 12 years ago.
[00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:47.558]  They've been caught saying that mass graves were really just people in boxes of sand that had been exchanged with the Iranians.
[00:37:47.618 --> 00:37:48.358]  That was admitted.
[00:37:49.158 --> 00:37:50.979]  That was declared Site 92.
[00:37:51.439 --> 00:37:52.320]  All this on and on.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:58.342]  I mean, we've been lied to so many times, but you watch, right before the election, they'll go, see, this vindicates them.
[00:37:58.362 --> 00:38:03.644]  Well, I think they've had their plans foiled for the time being.
[00:38:04.005 --> 00:38:09.507]  And that's why we're now trying to get 24 million veterans in this country on their feet and saying enough is enough.
[00:38:10.214 --> 00:38:18.082]  The very fact that we were able to get the George Bush military record which shows that in 1990, excuse me, that in 1972 he was suspended from flying because he refused to take his
[00:38:26.193 --> 00:38:30.216]  Uh, physical exam and that was the first year they required the drug test to be done.
[00:38:30.736 --> 00:38:41.644]  And you've probably heard by now that the other person who was suspended with him, which just does not happen, believe me, in, uh, flying, is that the other person that was suspended was James R. Bath.
[00:38:41.824 --> 00:38:48.728]  And that James R. Bath, of course, is the associate of Osama Bin Laden, uh, who introduced Arbusto Energy and George W. Bush together.
[00:38:48.748 --> 00:38:54.132]  And that's been, all of this has been in mainstream news, by the way, Fort Worcester Telegram years ago about Mr. Bath.
[00:38:54.981 --> 00:38:59.505]  This is incredible that these guys are all doing this, and it's right out in the open.
[00:38:59.525 --> 00:39:00.566]  Here's the problem, Joyce.
[00:39:01.387 --> 00:39:04.230]  They are telling us, look for more terror attacks.
[00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:05.431]  We want the Victory Act.
[00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:08.814]  They're discussions of arresting people that criticize the government.
[00:39:09.434 --> 00:39:11.356]  They've got to go for it all now.
[00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:20.905]  Whereas putting heat on them frustrates their plans, it also escalates their unpredictability and desperateness.
[00:39:21.565 --> 00:39:27.887]  And that's why it's imperative that every listener get on their feet and start working right now, because we've got a job ahead of us.
[00:39:27.947 --> 00:39:28.987]  Joyce, another lie.
[00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:40.070]  The former head of the Army, a scientist who was sent to whitewash in 1991 the depleted uranium problem, quit and said, this is killing our troops.
[00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:45.092]  They've got radiation holes rotted in their skins.
[00:39:46.172 --> 00:39:50.954]  You know, they're bleeding out of their intestines, all of the classic radiation.
[00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:53.754]  He's now done blood tests of British and Australian troops.
[00:39:53.814 --> 00:39:55.695]  He says they've been hit again with it.
[00:39:55.795 --> 00:39:56.435]  It's horrible.
[00:39:56.495 --> 00:39:56.995]  It's bad.
[00:39:57.015 --> 00:40:00.636]  This is the guy they hired to say it was good, and that's swept under the rug.
[00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:06.438]  He's supporting the troops, letting them die of nerve gas, giving them deadly vaccines that are now admitted to be deadly.
[00:40:07.098 --> 00:40:19.287]  Is supporting the troops, making them huff DU, is being conservative, turning your guns in, is being conservative, blanket amnesty for all illegals, is being conservative, getting rid of attorney-client privileges and juries.
[00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:27.773]  I mean, this is wall-to-wall evil, Joyce, and the neocons are up there laughing, saying Arnold Schwarzenegger's a good conservative when he's for abortion and gun control.
[00:40:28.174 --> 00:40:34.058]  Oh yeah, I mean, they've got everybody focused on Schwarzenegger, which is absolutely a non-entity as far as I'm concerned.
[00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:37.279]  But the way that we support our military is by telling the truth.
[00:40:37.479 --> 00:40:38.779]  That's always the way it's been.
[00:40:38.799 --> 00:40:39.679]  You don't support them?
[00:40:40.279 --> 00:40:43.160]  You don't support them by not caring about them and just waving a plastic flag?
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:43.820]  That's right.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.801]  The Chinese made an American flag.
[00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:49.241]  And it is time that everybody get busy and start educating.
[00:40:49.261 --> 00:41:00.664]  Now we're going to be working with all of the other veterans groups, the independent veterans groups, to try and get a massive move to inform the Department of Defense that we are not going to allow him
[00:41:01.224 --> 00:41:05.708]  Well, I'll tell you what, we're going to make some noise from this, and it's going to be heard.
[00:41:05.728 --> 00:41:13.234]  I mean, it may be the last sound they ever hear, but it is going to be heard, because you don't have a president
[00:41:25.413 --> 00:41:26.274]  He's a deserter.
[00:41:26.774 --> 00:41:30.816]  And a deserter is defined as being over 30 days away from his duty station.
[00:41:31.917 --> 00:41:32.838]  He is a deserter.
[00:41:33.218 --> 00:41:36.160]  He refused to take... He never flew after 1972.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.041]  Never flew.
[00:41:38.581 --> 00:41:42.904]  And that's because he refused to take the flight physical, which, that is denying a direct order.
[00:41:43.104 --> 00:41:44.365]  But Daddy was the head of the CIA, so...
[00:41:46.924 --> 00:41:49.985]  Yes, and poor Michael New's father wasn't.
[00:41:50.005 --> 00:42:00.070]  So he gets, of course, dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge, and yet the President goes on, and yet George W. goes on to become President.
[00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.351]  But George, that shows the hypocrisy of this system.
[00:42:02.371 --> 00:42:10.514]  They're attacking Mel Gibson for his film, The Passion, that's right out of the Bible, and the very same head of the Asylum and Resettlement Center is
[00:42:10.674 --> 00:42:16.679]  He's praising Arnold, who Arnold said in Pumping Iron that his idol was Adolf Hitler.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.923]  He, quote, saw him as a role model and supports Kurt Volton.
[00:42:20.983 --> 00:42:24.386]  I mean, it just shows the hypocrisy of all this.
[00:42:24.586 --> 00:42:30.371]  And Simon Wiesenthal Center admitted that Schwarzenegger's father was a Nazi, that they had confirmed that.
[00:42:30.632 --> 00:42:33.314]  But Arnold says that he admires Hitler!
[00:42:33.614 --> 00:42:35.356]  Well, it is all hypocrisy.
[00:42:35.616 --> 00:42:36.797]  But it's all delusion.
[00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:37.778]  It is all a fraud.
[00:42:38.258 --> 00:42:54.282]  And we're seeing through it, and that's why I don't get as angry at it as I used to, because I see through it now, and I'm now going to start some very, very serious actions to educate some other independent people so that we can get this information, get it out to the point where they have to reckon with it.
[00:42:54.442 --> 00:42:55.623]  They have to reckon with it.
[00:42:56.043 --> 00:43:00.684]  Now, these people that are dying over there, these young 20-year-old kids, 21-year-old kids, it just breaks my heart.
[00:43:01.264 --> 00:43:03.305]  And this could be anybody's son or daughter now.
[00:43:03.325 --> 00:43:05.806]  Well, now they're getting the national draft lined up, Joyce.
[00:43:06.106 --> 00:43:08.787]  Yes, and it's also going to be a medical draft.
[00:43:08.868 --> 00:43:14.550]  And as soon as the medical people learn about this, I think you're going to see a real change of heart here.
[00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:29.837]  By the way, they've got another draft now for the TIPS program where all commercial drivers, taxi cab, ice cream truck, I mean, it doesn't matter, 18 wheelers, they all have to spy for the government against all crime.
[00:43:30.726 --> 00:43:32.967]  And that's indentured servitude right there.
[00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:35.589]  I mean, they're setting up the East German model.
[00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.071]  Wow, I was not aware of that.
[00:43:38.111 --> 00:43:39.051]  That is pretty frightening.
[00:43:39.071 --> 00:43:41.593]  We posted that two days ago right off the government's own website.
[00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:42.914]  Yeah.
[00:43:43.534 --> 00:43:46.175]  Joyce, what about these new uniforms for the Air Force?
[00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:49.397]  Okay, I was absolutely shocked when I confirmed it.
[00:43:49.838 --> 00:43:58.403]  It was in Air Force Times and I have confirmed it that the Air Force is now planning on the new BDUs, those are the battle dress uniforms, the ones that everybody calls the camos.
[00:43:58.923 --> 00:43:59.463]  We're good to go.
[00:44:21.966 --> 00:44:27.851]  Because they're afraid that the American public is going to respond to this very negatively because it is the UN blue color.
[00:44:27.991 --> 00:44:33.275]  Well, the black beret is the EU-NATO model, and I've read the policy reports.
[00:44:33.535 --> 00:44:35.356]  This is about merging the uniforms.
[00:44:35.476 --> 00:44:37.538]  That's right, and that's exactly what this does.
[00:44:38.038 --> 00:44:43.643]  And on the emblem of the uniform, it says Defensor Fortis.
[00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:47.505]  It is not an Air Force emblem on the front of this
[00:44:48.866 --> 00:44:58.613]  So if you see the covers that they're using right now, one of them, a BDU cap, is an 8-pointed cap, they're calling it.
[00:44:59.353 --> 00:45:03.776]  And the other one is the black one with Defensor Fortis on the front of it and the rank.
[00:45:04.531 --> 00:45:08.694]  Now, the problem I see here is that they're going to try and integrate this very quietly.
[00:45:08.714 --> 00:45:13.138]  They're only going to put about 45 people on a base, so everybody will get used to seeing this.
[00:45:13.758 --> 00:45:20.843]  And I've even got the list of the first bases where they're going to put them on, because this is trying to integrate it into the system without people getting angry.
[00:45:21.304 --> 00:45:25.987]  The first uniforms will be seen at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, Hurlbut Field, Florida.
[00:45:27.245 --> 00:45:28.826]  Langley Air Force Base, Virginia.
[00:45:28.866 --> 00:45:30.348]  Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.
[00:45:30.368 --> 00:45:31.889]  McCord Air Force Base, Washington.
[00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.430]  Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany.
[00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.532]  And Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia.
[00:45:36.052 --> 00:45:38.294]  So that's where they're going to integrate them first.
[00:45:38.314 --> 00:45:41.716]  They signed the deals last year to bring in the foreign troops.
[00:45:41.756 --> 00:45:47.861]  The Associated Press, the deals are signed, quote, if we're attacked by terrorists, they're going to bring in the foreign troops.
[00:45:47.921 --> 00:45:49.222]  We saw that in the Army War College in 99.
[00:45:50.383 --> 00:45:54.165]  And we've got the foreign NATO aircraft, the AWACS and the Norwegian F-16s.
[00:45:54.805 --> 00:45:56.106]  They're really doing it, Joyce.
[00:45:56.426 --> 00:45:59.727]  Captain Joyce Riley, we'll be watching this as it develops, and thanks for coming on.
[00:45:59.747 --> 00:46:02.628]  And check it out at airforcetimes.com.
[00:46:02.648 --> 00:46:03.369]  Or thepowerhour.com.
[00:46:03.409 --> 00:46:03.909]  Thanks a lot.
[00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:04.869]  Appreciate it.
[00:46:04.949 --> 00:46:05.249]  You bet.
[00:46:05.289 --> 00:46:05.990]  God bless you, Joyce.
[00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.131]  Let's talk to Jeffrey in Louisiana.
[00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:16.147]  Okay, I was just listening to Joyce while you were talking.
[00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:22.415]  I just wanted to comment on the Simon Biesenthal hypocrisy concerning Mel Gibson's film.
[00:46:23.196 --> 00:46:27.462]  The information I'm about to give you is what Simon Biesenthal did not give Mel Gibson.
[00:46:28.123 --> 00:46:41.338]  In 325 B.C.E., or B.C., Malachi, the last of the Old Testament prophets, convened a parliament of parliaments in Jerusalem under the nose of the Greeks who had just conquered Jerusalem under Alexander the Great and his successors.
[00:46:42.018 --> 00:46:46.664]  They had to come up with three recommendations because only 120 people at that time knew the Bible.
[00:46:49.207 --> 00:46:56.925]  The recommendations were, quote, teach the Torah to everybody, write the Torah down, and build the offense around the Torah.
[00:46:58.587 --> 00:47:24.464]  That now they're going to have a class of people called scribes who had to copy the Bible down exactly as it was originally copied so they wouldn't lose any more information because beforehand the Jewish people and the Israelites had had their elite memorize the Bible and hand it down from father to son orally but now they're going to write it down then of course they're going to teach it to everybody meaning they're going to have everybody learn from a class of people called rabbis
[00:47:25.316 --> 00:47:36.599]  And then they're going to build a fence around the Torah, meaning they're going to build up some commentaries to aid in trying to find out what hidden customs were going on at the time the Bible was given to Moses on Sinai.
[00:47:37.259 --> 00:47:48.523]  From this assembly, called the Parliaments of Parliaments, came two different distinct schools concerning what was more important in the Bible.
[00:47:49.043 --> 00:47:52.664]  You've heard of the Sadducee-Pharisee fight, I'm sure.
[00:47:53.482 --> 00:47:53.962]  Certainly.
[00:47:54.323 --> 00:48:10.334]  Okay, the Pharisees, or Frackim, emphasized moral action and believed that a man had to save himself by his works and by his actions in terms of obeying the moral law, but they were a little not as... Okay, but Jeffrey, I'm not mad at you, but where's this going?
[00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:20.221]  Where it's going is to point out what Simon Beeson Thal did not tell Mel Gibson and why their statements are absolutely hypocritical.
[00:48:21.511 --> 00:48:25.921]  Well, I mean, all Gibson did was take the Bible and make a movie out of it, and everybody's freaking out.
[00:48:25.941 --> 00:48:28.646]  You got a guy that says he loves Hitler, and they say he's good.
[00:48:28.666 --> 00:48:29.709]  Stay there.
[00:48:32.958 --> 00:48:37.442]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:48:37.802 --> 00:48:41.885]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:42.746]  We listened.
[00:48:43.046 --> 00:48:48.030]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:48.791]  We listened.
[00:48:49.171 --> 00:48:52.213]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:48:52.654 --> 00:48:53.174]  We listened.
[00:48:53.635 --> 00:48:57.678]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:48:58.058 --> 00:48:58.558]  We listened.
[00:48:58.899 --> 00:49:04.143]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:05.905]  Again, we listened.
[00:49:06.285 --> 00:49:13.671]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:17.494]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:49:23.683 --> 00:49:26.264]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:49:26.304 --> 00:49:27.144]  The New World Order.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:47.861]  Panama.
[00:49:47.961 --> 00:49:52.183]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:49:52.243 --> 00:49:59.188]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:49:59.308 --> 00:50:01.369]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:50:01.729 --> 00:50:12.096]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:50:12.316 --> 00:50:13.597]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:14.197]  Are you a diabetic?
[00:50:14.237 --> 00:50:15.338]  Do you know someone who is?
[00:50:15.358 --> 00:50:17.478]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money.
[00:50:37.145 --> 00:50:43.169]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.
[00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.533]  And if that's of interest to you, you need to know about R-Tex Medical.
[00:50:47.853 --> 00:50:52.016]  We'll ship your diabetes supplies right to your door at no cost to you.
[00:50:52.476 --> 00:50:59.181]  And we work with Medicare and Medicaid and even most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[00:50:59.401 --> 00:51:02.402]  Call now to confirm your eligibility.
[00:51:02.422 --> 00:51:02.982]  800-419-2335.

[00:51:12.904 --> 00:51:15.445]  There are no membership fees, no shipping costs.
[00:51:15.725 --> 00:51:18.066]  We even file all the insurance claims.
[00:51:18.106 --> 00:51:18.906]  So call 24 hours a day.
[00:51:18.926 --> 00:51:18.966]  800-419-2335.
[00:51:18.986 --> 00:51:19.026]  800-419-2335. 800.
[00:51:27.568 --> 00:51:28.288]  Alright, folks.
[00:51:28.348 --> 00:51:31.950]  Let's go back to Jeremy real quick.
[00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:38.933]  Finishing up, Jeremy, with your point.
[00:51:38.993 --> 00:51:39.233]  Right.
[00:51:39.273 --> 00:51:39.813]  My point is this.
[00:51:44.019 --> 00:52:04.132]  That the Simon Wiesenthal Center's refusal or not giving this information, which is available in any Jewish prayer book under the title, Ethics of the Fathers, has jeopardized their view of Mel Gibson's film completely because they are guilty of contributing to the very complaint they're making.
[00:52:04.553 --> 00:52:13.739]  And of course, their business of supporting Arnold Schwarzenegger further discredits them as far as trying to be the arbiters of anti-Semitism is concerned.
[00:52:14.199 --> 00:52:25.483]  Well, this is amazing because the film is being done in Aramaic and in Hebrew and is word-for-word out of the Old Testament that's been compared to the Dead Sea Scrolls and is identical.
[00:52:25.503 --> 00:52:31.486]  I mean, he's literally, the entire script is the Bible, word-for-word, and they should love it.
[00:52:31.526 --> 00:52:35.367]  They want to keep the language alive and this is something they study and are all into.
[00:52:35.827 --> 00:52:38.708]  It just shows that, look, they're tools for the establishment.
[00:52:39.068 --> 00:52:43.210]  The establishment, you know, a lot higher up in the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
[00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:48.974]  Uh, likes Margaret Sangers, likes Arnold Schwarzenegger, likes Nazis and protects them.
[00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:54.559]  And then everybody that stands up for family or decency or heritage is then labeled a Nazi.
[00:52:54.979 --> 00:52:57.862]  And I think Simon Wiesenthal, they listed Steve Voss, folks.
[00:52:57.882 --> 00:52:58.823]  I mean, we play his music.
[00:52:59.223 --> 00:53:00.605]  There's nothing about race in there.
[00:53:00.645 --> 00:53:01.706]  They had to remove it, by the way.
[00:53:01.726 --> 00:53:02.466]  He threatened to sue them.
[00:53:02.486 --> 00:53:05.129]  But, you know, we know what this is about.
[00:53:05.249 --> 00:53:06.930]  Arnold gave them millions of dollars.
[00:53:08.243 --> 00:53:09.063]  It's just amazing.
[00:53:09.103 --> 00:53:09.704]  Thanks, Jeremy.
[00:53:10.184 --> 00:53:11.365]  Okay, and remember this.
[00:53:11.405 --> 00:53:14.566]  The Simon Beeson Law Center does protect communists at the same time.
[00:53:14.606 --> 00:53:20.669]  They wouldn't help expose the communists as anti-Semitic activities in Russia and Poland during World War II.
[00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:21.069]  I know.
[00:53:21.129 --> 00:53:21.750]  It's amazing.
[00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:27.052]  Again, folks, I do not support Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says he admires Hitler as a role model.
[00:53:27.072 --> 00:53:27.672]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:28.093 --> 00:53:29.133]  It's on the record.
[00:53:29.213 --> 00:53:29.853]  MSNBC.
[00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:33.095]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[00:53:33.775 --> 00:53:34.616]  John, you're on the air.
[00:53:34.656 --> 00:53:35.016]  Go ahead.
[00:53:36.994 --> 00:53:37.734]  I've got two points.
[00:53:37.754 --> 00:53:39.895]  Schwarzenegger and Infowars.net.
[00:53:41.015 --> 00:53:44.776]  Last week, CNN interviewed Joe Weider, owner of Muscle and Fitness magazine.
[00:53:44.876 --> 00:53:49.957]  He said that Schwarzenegger overdosed on illegal steroids and that's why he had heart surgery.
[00:53:50.617 --> 00:53:53.657]  And of course, steroids routinely cause psychotic roid rage.
[00:53:54.718 --> 00:53:59.519]  CNN also showed a video of Arnold smoking pot from the Pumping Iron documentary.
[00:54:00.439 --> 00:54:06.020]  CNN did predict that Arnold would probably be crucified for his adultery, but now it appears they're doing spin control.
[00:54:07.054 --> 00:54:16.961]  Now a book biography on Arnold pointed out that during his early career, he was so broke that he lived with rich homosexuals who paid him to pose nude for private photographs.
[00:54:16.981 --> 00:54:21.644]  As far as I know, they haven't been published, unlike Sylvester Stallone's porn movie.
[00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:25.447]  Today, these photos would be great for controlling a politician.
[00:54:25.467 --> 00:54:30.310]  It would also explain why Arnold likes to hang out with naked old men at the Grove.
[00:54:31.872 --> 00:54:33.493]  The other point is Infowars.net.
[00:54:34.574 --> 00:54:46.196]  My former ISP was AT&T, Comcast, Scripps Howard of Bohemian Grove, but they censored my email ISP and canceled it for reposting a Reuters article from Infowars.com.
[00:54:46.977 --> 00:54:52.518]  I'd also sent similar news items to Project Censored about Infowars.com.
[00:54:53.238 --> 00:54:56.699]  And then Dreamhost.com censored my website for the same alleged crime.
[00:54:57.479 --> 00:55:03.020]  My website discussed our skull and bones mayor who's trying to get Scripps Howard a billion dollars in corporate welfare.
[00:55:04.017 --> 00:55:08.759]  Then I switched to free AOL using the free CDs advertised by the U.S.
[00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:09.499]  Post Office.
[00:55:10.339 --> 00:55:16.441]  Then AOL's customer support reps in India slammed me for $140 a month in bogus charges.
[00:55:17.082 --> 00:55:23.404]  A bank canceled AOL's bogus debt, but AOL's CNN keeps sending me bogus invoices.
[00:55:24.384 --> 00:55:26.985]  And coincidentally, when I removed AOL from my computer,
[00:55:27.475 --> 00:55:29.797]  My printer died and I had to buy a new computer and printer.
[00:55:30.257 --> 00:55:35.061]  So I look forward to safe surfing and an uncensored use of InfoWars.net.
[00:55:35.361 --> 00:55:42.627]  Wow, well it sounds like you wrote that and I appreciate the commercial, but yeah, we have virtual browsers where your anonymity is protected.
[00:55:43.087 --> 00:55:47.050]  It's less than these other services and it's a great dial-up and we offer other things as well.
[00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:49.792]  I hope folks will go sign up at InfoWars.net.
[00:55:50.092 --> 00:55:56.577]  Well, if anybody wants to read my censored website, there's a link from InfoWars.com on the 911 page, September 911 Surprise.
[00:55:58.303 --> 00:55:58.643]  All right.
[00:55:58.824 --> 00:55:59.865]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:02.207]  Appreciate it, John.
[00:56:03.508 --> 00:56:05.830]  Larry and Dennis and Ron and others, you're up next.
[00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:12.115]  And yeah, the stuff he was saying about Arnold and the old men, I mean, that's been in the papers before.
[00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:13.636]  I'm not going to get off into it.
[00:56:14.317 --> 00:56:16.439]  We know what goes on at the Grove, folks.
[00:56:16.459 --> 00:56:17.359]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.101]  This is your neocon.
[00:56:22.196 --> 00:56:25.217]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:56:25.517 --> 00:56:30.458]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:56:30.698 --> 00:56:38.559]  That's because many chemicals are in... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.720]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:49.421]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.161 --> 00:56:51.261]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.922 --> 00:56:52.742]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.502 --> 00:56:54.423]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.063 --> 00:56:58.704]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.244 --> 00:57:03.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.606 --> 00:57:08.347]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:08.407 --> 00:57:09.588]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:14.149]  On the show, it is the 13th of August, 2003.
[00:57:17.165 --> 00:57:20.548]  We're going to have wide open phones and I'm about to get into some more of the news.
[00:57:20.568 --> 00:57:25.572]  I already talked about the American Bar Association's announcement of getting rid of attorney-client privilege.
[00:57:25.592 --> 00:57:27.393]  They want to get rid of juries as well.
[00:57:28.354 --> 00:57:32.757]  Contra Coast takes aim at .50 caliber rifles.
[00:57:33.198 --> 00:57:36.000]  Contra Coast County Supervisors are taking aim at .50 caliber rifles.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.182]  The board is concerned that the powerful
[00:57:39.593 --> 00:57:50.001]  Air rifles, that's right, the powerful rifles, excuse me, could be used to shoot at refinery targets, chemical plants, and trains in the county.
[00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:58.386]  So, see, we have this advertisement by the government that terrorists are going to use .50 calibers, we've got to ban them, and in California they're trying to ban below .40 caliber handguns.
[00:57:59.007 --> 00:58:04.411]  The rifles use the same ammunition fired by powerful military machine guns, blah blah blah.
[00:58:05.367 --> 00:58:10.210]  The rifles in question are not automatic weapons, but are most often used by target shooters or hunters.
[00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:16.393]  If the board approves an ordinance banning the guns today, it will be the first county in California to take such a step.
[00:58:16.413 --> 00:58:18.354]  Los Angeles banned the guns in June.
[00:58:19.515 --> 00:58:27.459]  Chuck Michaels, a spokesman for the California Rifle and Pistol Association, says the claims made by the gun, that the bullets can penetrate eight inches of concrete, for instance, are baloney.
[00:58:27.899 --> 00:58:32.942]  He says the gun would be like a pea shooter for terrorists who would have access to illegal weapons and explosives.
[00:58:32.982 --> 00:58:34.823]  He calls the ban a part of an anti-gun movement.
[00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:36.950]  So we'll get in more into that.
[00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:43.454]  Again, Jewish group attacks Gibson Film, but doesn't mind Arnold, who sat on national TV, admires Hitler.
[00:58:44.935 --> 00:58:51.540]  Jolted over election voting, electronic voting, more articles admitting that touchscreens are totally fraud based and don't work.
[00:58:52.921 --> 00:59:00.946]  Smart bomb technology moving to China, Pentagon brushes aside concerns of national security will be threatened as they arm real enemies of America.
[00:59:03.204 --> 00:59:07.008]  Also, man accused of improperly storing gunpowder, denied bail.
[00:59:07.748 --> 00:59:11.231]  Wheeler pleads guilty to arraignment based on November 7th trial date.
[00:59:11.251 --> 00:59:19.418]  So they're going after people who store gunpowder, but the borders are wide open and the Chinese government's been caught chipping in machine guns and laws rockets and opium.
[00:59:19.458 --> 00:59:20.018]  Nothing happens.
[00:59:21.199 --> 00:59:24.562]  We'll also get in to bring us home.
[00:59:24.602 --> 00:59:25.763]  GIs flood the U.S.
[00:59:26.184 --> 00:59:27.805]  with war-weary emails.
[00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:30.988]  Sick veteran battles bureaucracy back home.
[00:59:32.203 --> 00:59:42.613]  We've got a bunch of other articles here about a man jailed over adding something onto his house through federal controls.
[00:59:42.633 --> 00:59:51.542]  They're getting states and cities to pass zoning laws that are a whole new level of tyranny where you face years in jail, but you can't even have a jury because it's a petty crime.
[00:59:51.562 --> 00:59:52.383]  You certainly get this.
[00:59:55.231 --> 01:00:00.034]  Racist faces jail under first British court order to ban use of a word.
[01:00:00.534 --> 01:00:01.715]  Cover that first when we get back.
[01:00:02.235 --> 01:00:04.857]  Nylon relatives want to make National Service Day.
[01:00:04.877 --> 01:00:08.779]  So they want to make a slave of the government that's been carrying out the terror.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.581]  And it's all coming up, folks.
[01:00:13.482 --> 01:00:18.365]  We've got some good news, some good things that are happening as well.
[01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:20.526]  But first, we will get to some more of your calls.
[01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:23.688]  When we get back, on the other side of this quick break,
[01:00:24.779 --> 01:00:26.080]  We've got one phone line open.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.742]  If you want to join us on air on any of these issues, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:30.762 --> 01:00:35.864]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:35.884 --> 01:00:42.447]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:00:42.647 --> 01:00:44.288]  And the caller mentioned that CNN piece.
[01:00:44.348 --> 01:00:45.068]  I did read about it.
[01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:49.690]  Did you see it where they talked about Joe Weiner who brought Arnold
[01:00:51.906 --> 01:00:52.946]  To the U.S.
[01:00:53.027 --> 01:00:56.028]  as he had the heart problems because of steroid overdoses.
[01:00:57.248 --> 01:00:58.769]  And that's interesting.
[01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:04.951]  I mean, it's obvious Arnold was on steroids, folks, the way he puffed up and got smaller and got, you know, all that stuff.
[01:01:05.552 --> 01:01:10.454]  And that's been admitted, but I don't want to get off into Arnold all day, but people want to talk about it, so we'll talk about it.
[01:01:10.854 --> 01:01:13.335]  The hypocrisy, the incredible double standards, you name it.
[01:01:14.065 --> 01:01:14.405]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:23.110]  There are calls and a lot more news coming at you right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:29.254]  And be sure to read all these articles we post daily at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:29.274 --> 01:01:38.239]  I keep plugging those sites because there's a lot of folks tuning into the AM and FM dial for the first time here on this show and I want them to check out the sites and see the documentation for themselves.
[01:01:38.819 --> 01:01:39.500]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:39.880]  Stay with us.
[01:01:42.603 --> 01:01:46.950]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:51.577]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:51.717 --> 01:01:56.124]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.144 --> 01:01:57.486]  The New World Order.
[01:01:58.267 --> 01:01:59.187]  Panama.
[01:01:59.247 --> 01:02:03.468]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:10.470]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:12.691]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:12.991 --> 01:02:23.414]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:23.594 --> 01:02:24.874]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:02:25.094 --> 01:02:25.274]  That's 888-253-3139
[01:02:41.918 --> 01:02:44.940]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:50.184]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:02:50.445 --> 01:02:54.788]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:02:55.088 --> 01:03:04.015]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:07.838]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:13.167]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:03:13.447 --> 01:03:20.159]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:03:20.655 --> 01:03:21.315]  What about you?
[01:03:21.956 --> 01:03:27.318]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:44.827]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[01:03:44.907 --> 01:03:47.009]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:49.851]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.
[01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:55.036]  So the time to consolidate your individual credit card balances, car loans, and other debt has never been better.
[01:03:55.177 --> 01:03:57.038]  And no one makes it easier than the credit people.

[01:04:06.107 --> 01:04:06.567]  Low credit?
[01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:07.248]  Bad credit?

[01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:33.983]  Big Brother.
[01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:34.503]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:34.543 --> 01:04:35.443]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:35.463 --> 01:04:36.064]  You want answers?
[01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:36.884]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:58.773]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:59.374 --> 01:05:03.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:06.618 --> 01:05:08.319]  Citizens are standing up.
[01:05:08.379 --> 01:05:09.459]  They are fighting back.
[01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:18.865]  In Texas a few years ago, a former prosecutor, lawyer, put up a sign on his ramp saying that you can say no to searches.
[01:05:18.945 --> 01:05:22.367]  It's a Fourth Amendment violation with a phone number you called and it would give you a
[01:05:24.991 --> 01:05:27.754]  The history of the Fourth Amendment in a brief two-minute message.
[01:05:27.854 --> 01:05:29.856]  And we had Mr. Barber on the show.
[01:05:31.397 --> 01:05:35.020]  Then the state police said, we don't care if there's McDonald's signs right down the road.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.361]  We don't care if there's not a law.
[01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:38.203]  You can't have that sign.
[01:05:38.924 --> 01:05:40.965]  And indicted him, went after him.
[01:05:40.985 --> 01:05:41.706]  He had to take it down.
[01:05:41.726 --> 01:05:43.688]  But now across the country, others are doing it.
[01:05:44.168 --> 01:05:45.469]  And the police are having to back down.
[01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:46.971]  This is out of the Gainesville News.
[01:05:47.972 --> 01:05:50.614]  And it says, billboards warn of speed trap.
[01:05:51.887 --> 01:06:01.229]  And this is part of what the AAA is doing because they say police are harassing people, feeding on them.
[01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:03.589]  That's why Mr. Barber put the sign up.
[01:06:03.609 --> 01:06:08.310]  He'd see families at their church with their goods thrown on the road by the state police in Texas.
[01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.991]  This is in Florida.
[01:06:11.591 --> 01:06:13.711]  And he was outraged by it.
[01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:17.432]  They'll throw your goods on the road and then have you pick it up.
[01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:19.473]  That's America, folks.
[01:06:19.533 --> 01:06:20.213]  Here's another one.
[01:06:20.533 --> 01:06:21.313]  Dispute over
[01:06:22.484 --> 01:06:25.365]  Uh, who prompted man to disrobe at Lauderdale Airport.
[01:06:26.425 --> 01:06:38.490]  And, uh, it says here, a man who's a security guard at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport ordered him to remove his pants and then fed them through the x-ray machine as bystanders watched him stand there humiliated in his boxer shorts.
[01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:51.214]  Well, Lou Rockwell, one of his writers wrote about, a well-known writer, his eight-and-a-half-month-old pregnant wife, right in front of everyone, they made her take her clothes off down to her panties with her belly hanging out.
[01:06:52.378 --> 01:06:54.400]  And then the husband said, how dare you do this?
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.300]  She started crying.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.221]  And he said, how dare you?
[01:06:56.261 --> 01:07:02.205]  As they made fun of her, basically standing there naked, you know, down to her bra and panties in front of hundreds of people.
[01:07:02.745 --> 01:07:03.966]  And so they arrested him.
[01:07:04.407 --> 01:07:05.587]  And then later we started suing.
[01:07:05.607 --> 01:07:07.509]  And they said, oh, we found a knife in your bag.
[01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:08.429]  They never said at the time.
[01:07:08.449 --> 01:07:09.370]  It was obviously made up.
[01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:17.016]  And they told him, take your pants off or you'll be arrested.
[01:07:17.556 --> 01:07:20.258]  He said, do you think I'm crazy?
[01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:24.003]  And they said, do it now or you'll be arrested.
[01:07:24.063 --> 01:07:25.083]  What do you have to hide?
[01:07:25.363 --> 01:07:26.483]  And they're being told to do this.
[01:07:26.503 --> 01:07:27.943]  It's all about humiliation.
[01:07:28.403 --> 01:07:31.604]  And now they're saying, oh, we've got to have troops on the streets.
[01:07:32.804 --> 01:07:35.905]  We've got to have these screeners in the buses, on the roads.
[01:07:36.245 --> 01:07:37.705]  The threat's going to expand.
[01:07:37.765 --> 01:07:40.025]  See, highway checkpoints where they're going to do this.
[01:07:40.565 --> 01:07:45.206]  When I went up to Kansas City to do the expo up there a few months ago, it was very successful.
[01:07:46.886 --> 01:07:50.167]  On the way there, there's these federal toll roads slash state toll roads.
[01:07:51.274 --> 01:07:52.355]  And we slowed down to one.
[01:07:52.395 --> 01:07:53.235]  We had our video camera.
[01:07:53.255 --> 01:07:54.175]  We said, how's it going today?
[01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.796]  To a lady waving traffic in.
[01:07:55.816 --> 01:07:56.896]  And she said, turn that off!
[01:07:57.276 --> 01:07:58.057]  I'll have you arrested!
[01:07:58.117 --> 01:08:02.338]  And started yelling Homeland Security and literally running to the police.
[01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:04.719]  And they said, get out of here!
[01:08:04.759 --> 01:08:07.140]  And I said, go ahead.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.981]  I don't want you to tell me to go.
[01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:10.201]  And then you call the police on me.
[01:08:11.602 --> 01:08:12.362]  And they got mad.
[01:08:12.382 --> 01:08:15.923]  And I heard them whisper something along the lines of, oh, he knows that we're going to try to set us up.
[01:08:16.183 --> 01:08:17.644]  So I sat there and said, I'm waiting for the police.
[01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:20.149]  They said if you don't go, we're going to have you arrested.
[01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.270]  So it's going to be like that for all of you folks.
[01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.171]  A bunch of articles here on that.
[01:08:25.812 --> 01:08:28.894]  I talked about how the American Bar Association wants to get rid of juries.
[01:08:29.514 --> 01:08:35.457]  They've now ruled in their own little private group that no attorney-client privilege in any case, not just corporate fraud.
[01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:44.767]  I talked about the BBC reporter who went to a land rights group and said that landowners deserve the same rights as homosexuals and minorities.
[01:08:45.148 --> 01:08:45.948]  That's all he said.
[01:08:46.049 --> 01:08:48.651]  Scotland Yard Diversity Unit had him arrested.
[01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.672]  That article is on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.574]  Just go to the audio interviews and it'll say BBC.
[01:08:53.615 --> 01:08:55.276]  Click here to actually read the article.
[01:08:55.896 --> 01:09:00.020]  And Scotland Yard Diversity Unit head said that he said the word homosexual.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:04.103]  That offends people so that he would now be arrested.
[01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:06.664]  Now, it's a medical word.
[01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.587]  He wasn't even bashing homosexuals, but it didn't matter.
[01:09:09.947 --> 01:09:14.672]  They said that word's not allowed now because the so-called homosexual groups find it offensive.
[01:09:15.833 --> 01:09:21.519]  So, see, now, just regular words aren't allowed, and they're getting rid of juries on the same thing.
[01:09:21.559 --> 01:09:23.180]  But here's the one independent today.
[01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:24.702]  Racist.
[01:09:25.302 --> 01:09:25.663]  Racist.
[01:09:25.723 --> 01:09:26.363]  Oh, see, it's okay.
[01:09:26.603 --> 01:09:30.067]  Faces jail under first British court order to ban use of word.
[01:09:30.991 --> 01:09:32.051]  Bad use of word, folks.
[01:09:32.732 --> 01:09:37.613]  A man faces being sent to jail for the use of a specific term of racial abuse in public.
[01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:49.117]  Michael Galliflow, 31, is believed to be the first person in the UK... It's not true, they've done another headline in the London Telegraph was, hundreds raided nightly in hate crimes raids for speech.
[01:09:50.278 --> 01:09:54.439]  It says, believed to be the first person in the UK to be banned from using a particular word.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.000]  Packeye,
[01:09:57.279 --> 01:09:57.519]  I don't
[01:10:16.096 --> 01:10:17.377]  Well, you know what?
[01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:20.959]  If you don't agree with that, you know, call him a limey!
[01:10:35.135 --> 01:10:38.839]  But that's your God-given right, folks, because then it's going to be all speech.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:45.626]  They arrested a British minister, and fired him, who criticized, who said that the EU was a Nazi state.
[01:10:45.646 --> 01:10:46.948]  They said, oh, that's insulting.
[01:10:49.752 --> 01:10:58.616]  Out in Utah last year, the Associated Press reported a black umpire beat up a white woman with a local newspaper in front of the stands.
[01:10:59.076 --> 01:11:02.738]  He got mad, he got in an argument, she was taking photos, he started choking her, beating her up.
[01:11:03.238 --> 01:11:04.718]  You know, fights happen in sports.
[01:11:04.758 --> 01:11:06.099]  He was calling her racial names.
[01:11:06.559 --> 01:11:11.121]  Her husband jumped down out of the bleachers and yelled back at him a racial name.
[01:11:11.161 --> 01:11:14.683]  And both guys, you know, could grow up a little bit.
[01:11:15.163 --> 01:11:16.523]  Especially the guy assaulting her.
[01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:17.664]  But he didn't go to jail.
[01:11:19.176 --> 01:11:19.936]  In his raids.
[01:11:19.956 --> 01:11:20.797]  This was in the paper.
[01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:23.158]  She got fired from the paper.
[01:11:23.418 --> 01:11:24.698]  The police arrested him.
[01:11:24.718 --> 01:11:26.299]  These are mainstream folks.
[01:11:26.939 --> 01:11:29.220]  Because they called him a racial name back.
[01:11:30.401 --> 01:11:31.901]  So don't think it won't happen here, folks.
[01:11:31.961 --> 01:11:32.662]  It already is.
[01:11:35.043 --> 01:11:37.604]  And, uh, it just goes on and on, folks.
[01:11:39.358 --> 01:11:41.379]  Man jailed over house extension.
[01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:42.679]  BBC.
[01:11:42.879 --> 01:11:49.222]  A Telford man has been jailed for three months for refusing to pull down an unauthorized extension he built to his house.
[01:11:49.322 --> 01:11:50.382]  It's feudalism, folks.
[01:11:51.022 --> 01:12:02.567]  Sylvester Nezzo has been pursued through the courts by Telford and Work and Council for more than two years since building, in addition to his home, on Checkley Lane, St.
[01:12:02.607 --> 01:12:03.347]  George, without
[01:12:04.116 --> 01:12:05.557]  A planning permission.
[01:12:05.637 --> 01:12:07.339]  So we have the same feudalist system here.
[01:12:07.819 --> 01:12:09.601]  National Association of Counties and Cities go.
[01:12:09.941 --> 01:12:11.162]  They pass these federal laws.
[01:12:11.182 --> 01:12:13.584]  They arrest people in Austin all the time for adding on.
[01:12:14.005 --> 01:12:18.268]  They put, you know, $20,000 in fines in a week, folks, and then take your house.
[01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:21.171]  It goes on.
[01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:26.095]  Had already been given three months suspended sentence for contempt of court.
[01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:31.740]  That stroke on Trent County Court in June, but was allowed this month to come to his census.
[01:12:32.685 --> 01:12:43.255]  He was told by the judge in Stanford Council Court, Crown Court on Tuesday, that as he failed to pull down the extension in the agreed time, he must now serve a suspended 12-week prison term.
[01:12:44.036 --> 01:12:44.996]  Bulldozer plan.
[01:12:46.318 --> 01:12:50.381]  And now they're going to use a bulldozer to bulldoze it.
[01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:52.363]  So, same, it's a British system, folks.
[01:12:53.004 --> 01:12:53.905]  It's a feudal system.
[01:12:54.265 --> 01:12:56.347]  The king says you can't build onto the surf.
[01:12:57.596 --> 01:12:59.857]  Holding, and if you don't, they come and burn it!
[01:13:00.198 --> 01:13:01.278]  That's what they did!
[01:13:01.358 --> 01:13:02.179]  It's feudalism!
[01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:08.762]  Genetic engineering, genetic breeding, eugenics, it's all feudalism, neo-feudalism.
[01:13:10.443 --> 01:13:12.604]  Oh man, I got just... Folks, I'm not kidding.
[01:13:12.644 --> 01:13:16.026]  Today, my wife printed, my webmaster printed like a hundred articles.
[01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:17.927]  They're all worse than this, okay?
[01:13:19.248 --> 01:13:20.148]  Who's up next here?
[01:13:20.228 --> 01:13:24.971]  I guess... Who's up first, Mark?
[01:13:26.081 --> 01:13:27.302]  Larry Louisiana, go ahead.
[01:13:27.762 --> 01:13:29.384]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing today?
[01:13:29.584 --> 01:13:29.964]  Pretty good.
[01:13:30.284 --> 01:13:30.685]  Good.
[01:13:30.805 --> 01:13:34.047]  I'm smelling another rat and another lead-in story at the headliner.
[01:13:34.087 --> 01:13:43.655]  It's the one about the missile smuggled out of Russia and sold up there in New York to a... Oh yeah, the Russians and the globalists are having all these state-managed terrorist things every day.
[01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:46.858]  Well, they said how wonderful it was now that we have a world police connection.
[01:13:47.218 --> 01:13:48.139]  But here's the deal.
[01:13:48.559 --> 01:13:53.423]  A kid can be charged for a terrorist activity for drawing a picture of a gun in school.
[01:13:53.943 --> 01:13:59.786]  But the guys that sold this missile to the terrorists are not being charged with terrorism.
[01:14:00.286 --> 01:14:00.666]  Oh, I know.
[01:14:00.766 --> 01:14:06.429]  They, uh... They're being... Hey, all the time, kids are rousing for Tweety Bird pee change or drawing a picture of a gun.
[01:14:06.949 --> 01:14:07.989]  Well, here's the connection.
[01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:09.710]  It's about the money.
[01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:15.793]  Katie Couric got up there and asked the FBI expert, why aren't they being charged for... Oh, it's all about the money.
[01:14:16.053 --> 01:14:22.476]  So it's another lead-in story, and I believe the words are Arabic Intifada... How do you say that word?
[01:14:23.118 --> 01:14:23.699]  Interfada.
[01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:24.800]  Interfada.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.364]  Now that sounds to most people like, oh good, they're going to catch those Arabs doing cash transactions.
[01:14:30.464 --> 01:14:32.466]  But people, it's for Americans.
[01:14:32.486 --> 01:14:39.932]  Yeah, the new Victory Act for secret arrest, secret execution, trading, you know, $100 cash, terrorist offense to the $3,000.
[01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:41.834]  It's about total control.
[01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:56.545]  Right, so the message to that story about the missile is that if we can just have complete control of the money, and then of course later on... That's like the missing college kids that the FBI did say, and I've now got an article on it, that it should be illegal to buy gas for travel without being tracked.
[01:14:56.785 --> 01:15:10.776]  Exactly, that was the first lead-in I smelled, and this headliner is the second lead-in I'm smelling, because they're converting it from terrorism to just being about the money, so if we can just take care of control, completely control the money, and later on do away with it, we can control terrorism.
[01:15:10.876 --> 01:15:16.070]  Yeah, it should keep us all safe, but the border stays wide open and the big banks like BCCI fund all the terrorists.
[01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:16.591]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:17.573 --> 01:15:20.075]  Dennis in Missouri, then Ron and others.
[01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:20.836]  Dennis, go ahead.
[01:15:21.496 --> 01:15:21.937]  Are you there?
[01:15:22.197 --> 01:15:22.657]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:23.718 --> 01:15:25.099]  I met you at the Expo.
[01:15:25.159 --> 01:15:28.922]  I was having the Reform Party booth selling the t-shirts.
[01:15:29.163 --> 01:15:29.543]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:29.583 --> 01:15:40.592]  What I'm calling about is on KCTV, they actually had a little blurb where they said that a Muslim FBI agent had
[01:15:41.847 --> 01:15:50.369]  Uh, caught a British citizen trying to sell him one of those shoulder-fired missiles, you know, rocket launchers.
[01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:56.471]  Well, yeah, you got MI6 not knowing they're going to their other agents trying to sell them weapons.
[01:15:56.851 --> 01:15:58.192]  This sounds really bizarre.
[01:15:58.212 --> 01:15:59.632]  I couldn't believe what I heard.
[01:16:00.753 --> 01:16:10.936]  They didn't say who the guy was except that he was a British citizen and he was trying to sell an FBI agent who was posing as a Muslim terrorist.
[01:16:11.276 --> 01:16:12.256]  Look, that's all they do.
[01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:16.538]  They just run around trying to find idiots that will buy something from them.
[01:16:19.689 --> 01:16:20.790]  It's like Randy Weaver.
[01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:21.710]  You know, he didn't know any better.
[01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:23.131]  I'm not saying he's an idiot, but he was ignorant.
[01:16:24.252 --> 01:16:25.733]  They just kept coming by for years.
[01:16:25.773 --> 01:16:27.514]  They followed him from back east.
[01:16:27.574 --> 01:16:30.515]  And the same guy, please sell me a shotgun.
[01:16:30.595 --> 01:16:31.476]  Please saw it off.
[01:16:31.576 --> 01:16:31.936]  Please.
[01:16:32.556 --> 01:16:34.157]  And this kid, he's sitting here.
[01:16:34.317 --> 01:16:36.899]  Alright, I'll saw the shotgun off.
[01:16:37.099 --> 01:16:37.559]  I'll do it.
[01:16:37.579 --> 01:16:39.380]  And then, you know, tanks and helicopters.
[01:16:40.441 --> 01:16:40.821]  Stay there.

[01:19:41.249 --> 01:19:47.534]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:19:47.914 --> 01:19:51.997]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:59.703]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:07.606]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:20:07.946 --> 01:20:10.187]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.

[01:20:50.129 --> 01:20:52.870]  Folks, I've got news that will totally blow you away.
[01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:54.490]  I mean, it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:58.852]  And stories about how a bunch of colleges are going to offer Homeland Security degrees.
[01:21:00.232 --> 01:21:01.753]  They're going to institutionalize this.
[01:21:01.773 --> 01:21:04.033]  They're going to make this the new profession.
[01:21:04.273 --> 01:21:06.034]  Most of the government's going to be made up of it.
[01:21:06.414 --> 01:21:08.635]  Tattletales, secret police, surveillance.
[01:21:09.955 --> 01:21:13.776]  And of course, there'll be terrorism that will be needed to keep all this going.
[01:21:14.776 --> 01:21:17.437]  To set up this Orwellian situation.
[01:21:17.917 --> 01:21:19.598]  So we'll be getting into that and a lot more.
[01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:23.546]  In the next segment, there's just so much coming up.
[01:21:23.566 --> 01:21:25.688]  But right now, let's go back to Dennis in Missouri.
[01:21:26.228 --> 01:21:26.949]  Go ahead, Dennis.
[01:21:27.489 --> 01:21:43.202]  What I can say is that, you know, the media acts like the Brits are our allies and all that crap, and then they find a British citizen trying to sell a rocket-fired missile launcher to a supposedly fake Moslem terrorist.
[01:21:43.302 --> 01:21:44.683]  I mean, this is really bizarre.
[01:21:44.703 --> 01:21:47.826]  Well, sir, in Masters of Terror, in Police State 3, in the book,
[01:21:48.677 --> 01:21:56.936]  Ordered out of chaos, we detail, admitted, documented, mainstream, almost all terror in the British Isles, from Ireland to Scotland, to London.
[01:21:57.765 --> 01:22:01.466]  is carried out by MI5 and MI6 and this is what they do.
[01:22:01.906 --> 01:22:05.466]  Same thing with the CIA, the FBI, and others in this country.
[01:22:05.526 --> 01:22:07.047]  They get power and control.
[01:22:07.307 --> 01:22:18.028]  They're institutionalizing a police state around fighting terror, which means all crime, and they're going to make the criminal justice schools now all about homeland security out to be a jackbooted thug.
[01:22:18.088 --> 01:22:19.929]  We're entering a nightmare system.
[01:22:21.769 --> 01:22:22.369]  I believe you.
[01:22:23.529 --> 01:22:26.310]  It was nice seeing you up there anyway at Kansas City.
[01:22:27.555 --> 01:22:28.176]  I'll let you go.
[01:22:28.656 --> 01:22:29.256]  Thank you, sir.
[01:22:29.297 --> 01:22:29.917]  All right.
[01:22:30.117 --> 01:22:30.477]  You bet.
[01:22:30.538 --> 01:22:32.079]  Yeah, they're institutionalizing this.
[01:22:32.099 --> 01:22:33.680]  That's why they said the terror is never going to end.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:36.142]  Well, yeah, it's their excuse to get total control.
[01:22:36.362 --> 01:22:37.583]  What power mongers want?
[01:22:37.783 --> 01:22:38.784]  What history shows?
[01:22:38.904 --> 01:22:39.445]  Wake up!
[01:22:40.385 --> 01:22:41.747]  Resistance is not futile, folks.
[01:22:41.767 --> 01:22:44.749]  We've just got to keep saying no to this and exposing who the terrorists are.
[01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:47.591]  Ron in New York, and then Becky, Jim, Lou, and others.
[01:22:47.952 --> 01:22:48.792]  Now go ahead, Ron.
[01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:49.453]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:49.713 --> 01:22:50.914]  I pulled down a few things.
[01:22:50.954 --> 01:22:54.917]  I went through the daily newspapers here in New York today, and I got some things for you.
[01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:55.858]  But I'm going to start out.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:59.761]  With the new ABA standards for lawyer-client confidentiality.
[01:23:00.461 --> 01:23:05.743]  Um, all the newspapers here are playing it up that it only pertains to large corporate Enron-type fraud.
[01:23:05.803 --> 01:23:06.583]  Well... Total lie!
[01:23:06.803 --> 01:23:07.603]  Okay, it is a lie.
[01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:13.025]  I called the ABA yesterday, I called the National Headquarters, and they read to me the regulation verbatim.
[01:23:13.365 --> 01:23:22.027]  And most of the regulation does ramble on about corporate fraud, but just about at the end, there's a, uh, a little clause and error in it, like, slash any crime.
[01:23:22.921 --> 01:23:29.203]  So, they threw that little catch-all phrase in there, so, you know, they ramble on, corporate fraud, corporate fraud, and it applies to any crime.
[01:23:29.223 --> 01:23:30.943]  It's the same thing about Homeland Security and Patriot Act.
[01:23:30.983 --> 01:23:44.888]  We love everyone, you have total rights, we just love Mickey Mouse, and we're just sweet and lovable little furballs of love, and then we could secretly arrest you and kill you and bring in foreign troops and put you in prison for life for any reason, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:44.908 --> 01:23:47.108]  The Homeland Security Act is like that too, right?
[01:23:47.128 --> 01:23:51.970]  It rambles on about foreign terrorism, and then you'll find usually at the end a few words and a paragraph or a sentence,
[01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:55.532]  Terrorism is in the action that endangers human life.
[01:23:55.552 --> 01:23:56.313]  We'll put you in prison.
[01:23:56.333 --> 01:23:57.354]  We'll secretly execute you.
[01:23:57.374 --> 01:23:57.974]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:23:58.354 --> 01:24:05.960]  So, my advice is anybody that goes to an attorney at this point, you better make damn sure and have it in black and white that there truly is confidentiality.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:06.700]  Okay, let me stop you.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.522]  We've got somebody saying the C word and now the D word.
[01:24:09.702 --> 01:24:11.283]  We've got a lot of kids listening.
[01:24:11.584 --> 01:24:12.164]  Remember that.
[01:24:12.204 --> 01:24:14.906]  You're addressing tens of thousands of homeschoolers.
[01:24:14.946 --> 01:24:17.608]  This show is required listening for thousands of homes.
[01:24:17.728 --> 01:24:18.929]  Please watch your language.
[01:24:19.509 --> 01:24:20.589]  But now we move on.
[01:24:20.829 --> 01:24:22.390]  Now we have some Nazis are in, man.
[01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:23.490]  Nazis are in fashion.
[01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:25.971]  The Daily News, page 8 off the AP Wire.
[01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:32.353]  A chic upscale clothing store in Hong Kong was selling Nazi fashions.
[01:24:32.933 --> 01:24:39.015]  They had swastikas decorating the stores, and they were playing loops of old Nazi propaganda films.
[01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:46.197]  It had to come to an end, but the manager of one of the stores in Hong Kong said that the people in Hong Kong had liked it.
[01:24:47.298 --> 01:24:48.018]  Oh, look!
[01:24:48.158 --> 01:24:48.398]  I mean...
[01:24:49.247 --> 01:24:50.909]  Uh, this is what Arnold's all about.
[01:24:50.989 --> 01:24:52.611]  He says he admires Hitler.
[01:24:52.651 --> 01:24:53.592]  That's his role model.
[01:24:53.852 --> 01:24:55.834]  He hangs out with Kurt Voltheim, defends him.
[01:24:56.434 --> 01:24:56.875]  That's cool now.
[01:24:56.895 --> 01:24:57.656]  The New York criminal.
[01:24:57.956 --> 01:25:00.399]  And then the Simon Wiesenthal Center says they're great.
[01:25:01.039 --> 01:25:02.100]  Says that Arnold's great.
[01:25:02.481 --> 01:25:03.061]  Newsday.
[01:25:03.342 --> 01:25:04.182]  Today's Newsday.
[01:25:04.242 --> 01:25:05.043]  New York Newsday.
[01:25:05.103 --> 01:25:05.764]  Obituary.
[01:25:06.465 --> 01:25:09.648]  Lady Diane Mosley, wife of Sir Oswald Mosley.
[01:25:09.668 --> 01:25:12.451]  He was a fascist leader in Britain during World War II.
[01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:16.410]  Sister of the Duchess of Devonshire passes away 93.
[01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:17.631]  She was loyal to the end.
[01:25:17.971 --> 01:25:18.531]  Do you get it?
[01:25:18.811 --> 01:25:22.253]  Lady, Duchess, Serb, British aristocracy, Nazis.
[01:25:22.273 --> 01:25:22.873]  Does it connect?
[01:25:23.313 --> 01:25:25.394]  Well, that's what the British aristocracy is.
[01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.855]  There it is in black and white.
[01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:29.415]  They are admitted Merovingians.
[01:25:29.475 --> 01:25:31.196]  They're Alsatians.
[01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:34.455]  Now, also, you say there's lots of kids listening.
[01:25:34.475 --> 01:25:35.955]  Well, we got a new toy for them.
[01:25:36.236 --> 01:25:38.496]  New York Post, page 3, Vincent Morris.
[01:25:39.077 --> 01:25:40.777]  A Bush-style, G.W.
[01:25:40.797 --> 01:25:41.818]  Bush-style, G.I.
[01:25:41.878 --> 01:25:43.438]  Joe doll is now available.
[01:25:44.519 --> 01:25:45.179]  George W. Bush.
[01:25:45.199 --> 01:25:47.200]  Aircraft Aviator Commander.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:48.000]  Right.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.501]  Dressed in his flight suit.
[01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:51.801]  So they could buy that.
[01:25:51.881 --> 01:25:54.422]  Parents could buy that for all the kids to play with.
[01:25:54.962 --> 01:25:56.763]  And I guess we could deify him.
[01:25:56.823 --> 01:25:57.183]  You're right.
[01:25:57.243 --> 01:25:58.223]  We should have feudalism.
[01:25:58.304 --> 01:25:59.344]  It should be Lord Bush.
[01:26:00.304 --> 01:26:07.030]  Let's say instead of the Senator of New York, we'll have the Duchess Hillary Clinton of New York, and it goes on and on.
[01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:13.355]  Also, if you could follow up with a story about that guy in the mall upstate New York who was arrested for wearing the Peace T-shirt.
[01:26:13.895 --> 01:26:17.839]  And by the way, you remember that prodigy child who was a homeschooler here in New York?
[01:26:18.399 --> 01:26:20.000]  You had him on the show I told you about?
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:20.941]  Yeah, they're trying to take her.
[01:26:21.261 --> 01:26:27.787]  Yeah, went to court, they ruled that no matter how you look at it, she hasn't got enough credit, has to go through high school.
[01:26:28.207 --> 01:26:29.328]  Stay there, I want to hear about that.
[01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:30.930]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.014 --> 01:26:33.936]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.417 --> 01:26:36.020]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.962 --> 01:26:39.647]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.152 --> 01:26:45.754]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[01:26:45.914 --> 01:26:48.796]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:54.200]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-8-1-888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.721]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:27:11.588 --> 01:27:13.369]  Warrior calls and a ton of news.
[01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:18.411]  Again, Warrior calls and a ton of news coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:22.733]  Real quick, I wanted to let Ron in New York finish up.
[01:27:22.773 --> 01:27:24.734]  Yeah, it was in the New York Post and other papers.
[01:27:25.714 --> 01:27:28.335]  15 years old, graduating from an accredited college with a 3.84.
[01:27:29.036 --> 01:27:32.877]  It's about a 97 average.
[01:27:34.218 --> 01:27:38.800]  And when they saw her in the paper, the CPS has been trying to take her from the family.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.620]  That was in the news.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.761]  We had the family on.
[01:27:42.091 --> 01:27:44.933]  And now Ron is giving us an update on what happened.
[01:27:45.634 --> 01:27:47.736]  So what does the paper say ended up happening with her?
[01:27:47.756 --> 01:27:52.219]  The story was reported on the ABC Radio News Network two days ago.
[01:27:52.759 --> 01:28:04.949]  Even after they take in consideration everything she achieved, which we know is massive, they determined that she only was able to obtain 27 credits, which fell short of what is necessary for a high school diploma.
[01:28:05.349 --> 01:28:06.710]  And now she's got to go through it.
[01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:10.894]  Now understand, they blocked the college giving her her honors degree.
[01:28:11.434 --> 01:28:11.955]  That's correct.
[01:28:12.295 --> 01:28:15.357]  And so they're saying she's got to go back to a school.
[01:28:15.378 --> 01:28:19.461]  And folks, you've always been able to get into college.
[01:28:19.481 --> 01:28:21.883]  There's kids graduating all the time at 15 from college.
[01:28:22.844 --> 01:28:24.005]  But no, they don't want that.
[01:28:24.045 --> 01:28:25.626]  They want you to be a mindless idiot.
[01:28:25.646 --> 01:28:26.187]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:27.463 --> 01:28:28.063]  Yeah, Ron?
[01:28:28.304 --> 01:28:29.204]  Listen, one last thing.
[01:28:29.224 --> 01:28:35.307]  When I did call the ABA and spoke with a person there above with confidentiality rules, she said the following, and I have to say this.
[01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:38.489]  She said, well, the rule is based on the discretion of the attorney.
[01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:45.413]  And I think and say, yeah, and he'll exercise that discretion in proportion to the government reward offered for information.
[01:28:45.533 --> 01:28:46.253]  Well, that's it.
[01:28:46.533 --> 01:28:48.494]  Your lawyer now is a spy for the government.
[01:28:49.415 --> 01:28:53.237]  And the same American Bar Association has said they want to get rid of juries.
[01:28:53.617 --> 01:28:55.118]  They want to get rid of them, folks!
[01:28:56.437 --> 01:29:01.825]  Well, I don't know, maybe we should just let Hannity and Limbaugh do our thinking for us.
[01:29:02.626 --> 01:29:12.641]  Well, hey, they say Arnold's good, abortion, gun control, homosexual adoption of kids, that's the new conservatism, and we're liberals.
[01:29:13.266 --> 01:29:21.009]  You know, Limbaugh says, well, Arnold, you know, Ted, you know, the Kennedys, Joseph Kennedy was in with the Nazis, and you don't hear the liberals saying that.
[01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:23.550]  Yeah, you don't hear them talking about Margaret Sanger either.
[01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:27.071]  Just because they're in with the Nazis doesn't mean it's okay if the Republicans are.
[01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:28.992]  I just love this system.
[01:29:29.292 --> 01:29:30.573]  Two wrongs don't make a right.
[01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:31.993]  Oh, it's out of control.
[01:29:32.013 --> 01:29:33.434]  People got to wake up.
[01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:34.995]  They gotta wake up, Alex.
[01:29:35.715 --> 01:29:37.035]  You're a pro-gun, right?
[01:29:37.516 --> 01:29:37.896]  I'm sorry?
[01:29:38.296 --> 01:29:39.356]  You're pro-Second Amendment?
[01:29:39.616 --> 01:29:40.056]  Yes, I am. 110%?
[01:29:41.597 --> 01:29:43.438]  Yes, I'm pro-constitution.
[01:29:43.518 --> 01:29:45.259]  Then you're a liberal communist.
[01:29:45.359 --> 01:29:47.420]  Anti-gun, anti-America.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.021]  You're a very conservative good person.
[01:29:49.361 --> 01:29:49.942]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:50.082 --> 01:29:50.622]  That's correct.
[01:29:50.662 --> 01:29:51.583]  That's the way they think.
[01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:52.123]  Thank you, Ron.
[01:29:52.143 --> 01:29:52.743]  Gotta let you go.
[01:29:53.564 --> 01:29:54.424]  Yeah, that's the system.
[01:29:54.624 --> 01:29:59.047]  We're gonna go to Becky, Jim, Lou, Tim, and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:29:59.107 --> 01:30:00.368]  And I think we've got a bunch of other news.
[01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:03.850]  But for the next five, we are joined by my good buddy, Jim Shepard.
[01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:05.951]  We're talking about how to protect yourselves, folks.
[01:30:06.551 --> 01:30:09.613]  The globalists have said the water supplies are a target, will be hit.
[01:30:09.633 --> 01:30:10.653]  I hope that's not the case.
[01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:14.255]  But we know they've already been hit by deadly fluoride, admitted to be deadly.
[01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:17.037]  The big Canadian scientist who was for it just said it's bad.
[01:30:17.857 --> 01:30:20.579]  We know they're putting herbicide, pesticide, we know it's all in there.
[01:30:20.699 --> 01:30:22.580]  Prozac gets in there, Ritalin gets in there.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.782]  Dead bacteria, the chlorine may kill the bacteria, but you're still drinking them.
[01:30:27.423 --> 01:30:29.584]  The big barking line of filters are the best out there.
[01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.325]  I bought them before Jim was a sponsor.
[01:30:31.745 --> 01:30:33.446]  This show's about taking control of your life.
[01:30:34.139 --> 01:30:40.200]  And they've got new, even more powerful filters, made in America, at great prices, and we've got some specials for you.
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.581]  So, Jim Shepard, tell them all about it.
[01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:43.821]  Okay.
[01:30:44.381 --> 01:30:52.823]  Well, most people are pretty familiar with the power of the black Berkey filter elements, the ones that are in the Berkey light systems.
[01:30:53.163 --> 01:31:03.805]  The fluoride is a big issue, and as we discussed the other day, the head guy in Canada that got fluoride into the water of the Canadian system,
[01:31:04.403 --> 01:31:05.084]  Folks, they don't know.
[01:31:05.104 --> 01:31:07.365]  They're not using calcium fluoride.
[01:31:07.385 --> 01:31:08.806]  Small amounts of it are good for you.
[01:31:34.375 --> 01:31:41.397]  They're using the sodium fluoride that is the byproduct of aluminum and fertilizer manufacturing.
[01:31:42.037 --> 01:31:46.439]  Now that's a fact, folks, and we have hundreds of university studies.
[01:31:47.119 --> 01:31:48.880]  Most filters will not cut the fluoride out.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.340]  Jim has got one that will.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.320]  Go ahead and tell them about it, Jim.
[01:31:51.741 --> 01:31:53.261]  Okay, well we're going to run a special.
[01:31:53.501 --> 01:31:57.982]  This is the PF2, and this is for folks who have black, burky filter elements.
[01:31:59.303 --> 01:32:02.644]  They come with the burky light system.
[01:32:03.608 --> 01:32:07.009]  And if you get the ceramic filters, then we've got a different one for that.
[01:32:07.049 --> 01:32:09.289]  But this is for the black Berkey filter elements.
[01:32:09.989 --> 01:32:19.651]  And they're designed to reduce the fluoride, arsenic, and any residual heavy metal ions that are in the water.
[01:32:20.472 --> 01:32:21.912]  And we have just improved.
[01:32:23.112 --> 01:32:26.473]  The new ones run about 20% faster than the old ones.
[01:32:26.493 --> 01:32:30.114]  So we're going to offer a special on the Generation 1 PF2 filters.
[01:32:32.432 --> 01:32:49.099]  If you don't have a Berkey system and you order a Berkey light with the lights for $2.59 or the Berkey light without the lights for $1.99, add $10 to the order and we'll send you a set of $50 PF2 fluoride filters.
[01:32:49.139 --> 01:32:50.200]  Now for those who don't know,
[01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:53.632]  This filter does 20 gallons a day.
[01:32:54.233 --> 01:32:56.435]  The new one you did does 30 gallons a day.
[01:32:56.475 --> 01:32:57.376]  So it's a great deal.
[01:32:57.916 --> 01:33:03.042]  Most of you aren't going to use more than 20 gallons a day, folks, for drinking water and for cooking water.
[01:33:03.702 --> 01:33:05.024]  That's a good point.
[01:33:05.224 --> 01:33:11.430]  And I think the point is that they're going to remove the same amount of fluoride from the water.
[01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:13.152]  They're not any less efficient.
[01:33:13.272 --> 01:33:14.834]  It's just that they flow slower.
[01:33:15.712 --> 01:33:17.713]  And then the new generation.
[01:33:18.113 --> 01:33:22.134]  And so there's plenty of water to go to for a family.
[01:33:23.295 --> 01:33:34.739]  And now, if you want two sets, then add $20 to your Berkey order, and we'll send you out $100 worth of PF2 filters.
[01:33:35.599 --> 01:33:43.302]  If you already have a Berkey light, and you want to get the PF2 filters, then we'll sell those to you for half price.
[01:33:44.339 --> 01:33:54.026]  And so instead of $50, it would be $25 a set, and this is a great way to stock up, you know, for future years on the PF2s.
[01:33:54.266 --> 01:33:59.670]  And so I think we've got probably about 60 or 70 sets left, and when those are gone, they're gone.
[01:34:00.331 --> 01:34:00.811]  All right.
[01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:02.232]  And it's all a great value.
[01:34:02.272 --> 01:34:03.693]  Take control of your life, folks.
[01:34:04.274 --> 01:34:09.177]  Call right now, and if the folks answering the phones are busy, leave your name and number.
[01:34:09.217 --> 01:34:10.258]  They'll call you right back.
[01:34:11.619 --> 01:34:12.820]  Or just call back.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.820]  The toll-free number to call is 1-888-803-4438.
[01:34:17.201 --> 01:34:22.102]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:34:24.563 --> 01:34:26.904]  You also have shower filters.
[01:34:27.944 --> 01:34:30.945]  You have potassium iodate in case there's a nuclear exposure.
[01:34:30.985 --> 01:34:33.566]  You take it, it blocks the thyroid with the good iodine.
[01:34:35.177 --> 01:34:42.520]  You've got the sports bottle filters that are portable, so you can feed that tap water and work through it.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:45.041]  It cuts out everything but the fluoride, unfortunately.
[01:34:45.061 --> 01:34:46.302]  It reduces that somewhat.
[01:34:46.622 --> 01:34:48.643]  Fluoride is just designed to go through everything.
[01:34:49.303 --> 01:34:50.524]  How much are the sports bottles?
[01:34:51.744 --> 01:34:53.465]  Well, the sports bottles are $39.
[01:34:55.606 --> 01:35:00.968]  If you order a Berkey Light, we'll go ahead and do a special on that and add an extra
[01:35:03.858 --> 01:35:07.620]  Add an extra $15 and we'll send you a support bottle.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.261]  Alright folks, 1-888-803-4438.
[01:35:09.461 --> 01:35:14.264]  I know a lot of you have been listening.
[01:35:14.284 --> 01:35:20.687]  You've heard me read the reports about what sodium fluoride does and the stuff that's mixed in with it, as the big Canadian expert just said.
[01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:23.280]  You need to take action.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.464]  Jim, why do you think so many professors and scientists that were for fluoride are now coming out against it?
[01:35:28.924 --> 01:35:30.305]  Well, I think that you have two types.
[01:35:30.345 --> 01:35:40.693]  You know, you have the ones that learn things in college, and they don't want to learn anything after that, and then basically what they learned 20 years ago is what they believe, and that's not going to change.
[01:35:41.314 --> 01:35:50.181]  And then you have others who, I think there's a lot of them who, you know, they hear people talking about the toxic properties of fluoride,
[01:35:51.005 --> 01:35:58.008]  And so they go to do the research to prove them wrong, and in the research they start discovering that, wait a minute, maybe they're not wrong, maybe I'm the one that's wrong.
[01:35:58.788 --> 01:36:06.131]  And I've known quite a few... Well, that's like the head guy of the Army who they sent to whitewash the depleted uranium in 1991.
[01:36:06.491 --> 01:36:08.992]  He quit and said, this is killing the troops, this is deadly.
[01:36:09.372 --> 01:36:12.913]  They got radiation sickness, and now he's out saying it's happened again.
[01:36:12.973 --> 01:36:15.774]  I mean, look, the globalists have got a problem, folks.
[01:36:16.094 --> 01:36:18.855]  If you'll just investigate what we're saying, you'll find out it's true.
[01:36:20.831 --> 01:36:22.032]  Now is the time, folks.
[01:36:22.052 --> 01:36:22.572]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:36:22.832 --> 01:36:26.815]  Take advantage of this special.
[01:36:27.455 --> 01:36:38.363]  Jim, the American Bar Association, in their document, and I've looked at it, not just for corporate fraud, it's for all so-called crime, now your lawyer is a tattletale of the government.
[01:36:39.844 --> 01:36:40.984]  Is that not incredible?
[01:36:41.245 --> 01:36:42.465]  That is incredible.
[01:36:42.525 --> 01:36:44.427]  What happened to attorney-client privilege?
[01:36:44.907 --> 01:36:47.829]  They just voted it down yesterday in San Francisco.
[01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:52.393]  Now, is this for the state of California or is this nationwide?
[01:36:52.433 --> 01:36:57.778]  No, the National Bar met in San Francisco and got the Associated Press article here.
[01:36:57.798 --> 01:36:58.419]  Let me dig it out.
[01:36:58.939 --> 01:37:05.525]  ABA erases rule on informing lawyers can now report suspected fraud by clients.
[01:37:06.346 --> 01:37:07.587]  And that is the Washington Post.
[01:37:07.607 --> 01:37:08.909]  They have another AP article here.
[01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:10.090]  They voted 218 to 201 with the board.
[01:37:13.146 --> 01:37:14.447]  Boy, that's a real slick deal.
[01:37:14.487 --> 01:37:22.270]  You go to, uh, somebody goes to an attorney, he charges them $280 an hour or whatever they charge now, so that he can inform on them.
[01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:23.190]  That's a deal.
[01:37:23.650 --> 01:37:26.552]  Well, they've already been doing it and getting in trouble, so this is to protect them.
[01:37:27.132 --> 01:37:30.033]  Oh, they also are calling to abolish the jury system.
[01:37:32.874 --> 01:37:33.835]  Boy, that's real sweet.
[01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:43.201]  I tell you Alex, some of the stuff that's coming down the pike, if somebody said this was going to happen 15 years ago, everybody would say you're stark raving mad.
[01:37:45.202 --> 01:37:53.505]  I don't know if you've ever read David Wilkerson's book.
[01:37:53.525 --> 01:37:56.626]  I read it back in 1976, I think it was called The Vision.
[01:37:57.226 --> 01:38:01.508]  Anyway, in that he had a vision and he kind of laid it out.
[01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.693]  Of what was going to take place in America.
[01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:10.777]  Back in the 1970s, I guess I read that in 76, yeah.
[01:38:11.398 --> 01:38:14.641]  In 76 I read that and it just seemed like science fiction.
[01:38:15.061 --> 01:38:15.782]  I haven't heard of that.
[01:38:15.822 --> 01:38:17.484]  What did he say was going to happen?
[01:38:17.924 --> 01:38:21.007]  I picked that book up about a year ago and re-read it and I couldn't believe it.
[01:38:21.107 --> 01:38:23.049]  It was just all like ancient history.
[01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:28.093]  Oh, he said that, well some of the things that he said is that they would start ordaining gay
[01:38:29.715 --> 01:38:33.936]  Uh, you know, ministers and, you know, back in 76 it was like, what?
[01:38:33.976 --> 01:38:35.557]  This had never happened in America.
[01:38:36.617 --> 01:38:44.639]  And, uh, uh, oh geez, just, you know, all the stuff that's on the front headlines is stuff that he was, he wrote in that book back in 1976.
[01:38:45.739 --> 01:38:55.022]  And, uh, and it's been about a year since I've read it, but what I can tell you is that the stuff that he wrote in there that just, well, one of the things that he said back then is that you would,
[01:38:55.856 --> 01:39:00.059]  That people would be getting pornography on their home TVs.
[01:39:00.579 --> 01:39:04.221]  And it was like, no, this could never happen in America way back then.
[01:39:04.641 --> 01:39:07.903]  Today, through cable TV, that's just everyday stuff.
[01:39:08.063 --> 01:39:15.168]  Hey, like I said, I've walked into hotel rooms, turned it on, and somebody was in there before me, you know, six hours before, bought the big package.
[01:39:15.848 --> 01:39:17.629]  And it's just Triple X right there.
[01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:20.331]  And then I was in Kansas City.
[01:39:20.391 --> 01:39:22.592]  It wasn't just the heterosexual stuff, folks.
[01:39:22.792 --> 01:39:24.353]  There in the menu, it wasn't on.
[01:39:24.393 --> 01:39:25.414]  I just looked at the menu.
[01:39:26.335 --> 01:39:33.561]  And now Channel 4 in England is going to air... I hate to even mention this, folks.
[01:39:33.581 --> 01:39:34.542]  This is BBC.
[01:39:35.523 --> 01:39:37.864]  Ten-year-old kids having sex in a house.
[01:39:38.745 --> 01:39:41.347]  I mean, like Big Brother, with cameras.
[01:39:41.808 --> 01:39:42.548]  You're kidding.
[01:39:42.808 --> 01:39:43.009]  Nope.
[01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:45.371]  This is going to be in the UK or in America?
[01:39:45.491 --> 01:39:45.831]  UK.
[01:39:45.891 --> 01:39:49.134]  And the same channel last year had the guy eat the baby.
[01:39:49.174 --> 01:39:49.874]  A real baby.
[01:39:49.974 --> 01:39:52.016]  Saw it up, eat it, marinate it.
[01:39:54.230 --> 01:40:15.289]  I tell you, I don't know where it is all going to end, but I tell you what, it's like, at times I feel like I'm going into a science fiction movie, you know, you used to see these old science fiction movies about Atlantis, you know, and they were mixing, you know, cows with humans and guys had horns and all this stuff, and it's just like this strange, bizarre society, and it just seems like
[01:40:15.908 --> 01:40:17.951]  Dang, you know, we're just going down that road.
[01:40:17.991 --> 01:40:24.160]  Yeah, in Taiwan, on the streets, they're selling a cross between a fish and a jellyfish.
[01:40:24.938 --> 01:40:35.886]  And it's like Blade Runner where, you know, the Blade Runner's walking along, the cop is, and he's, you know, showing people the genetics of this snake, and they go, ah, superior craftsmanship, you know, excellent quality.
[01:40:35.946 --> 01:40:37.667]  Now the very thing's going on with this.
[01:40:37.867 --> 01:40:40.589]  I saw, I watched a video clip on the news site about it.
[01:40:40.869 --> 01:40:45.192]  They show these fish that glow in the dark, they're part jellyfish, and you buy them.
[01:40:45.252 --> 01:40:47.714]  I mean, it's just genetic-engineered chimeras.
[01:40:48.334 --> 01:40:50.315]  Just in the corner square?
[01:40:50.335 --> 01:40:52.696]  Yeah, I was listening.
[01:40:52.716 --> 01:40:55.718]  I think it was a public PBS station.
[01:40:56.318 --> 01:41:03.282]  But anyway, they were talking about that they have a cross between a monkey and a jellyfish, and the hair glows green on the thing.
[01:41:04.023 --> 01:41:04.883]  I mean, this is just a regular TV.
[01:41:04.903 --> 01:41:05.163]  Oh, I saw that.
[01:41:05.183 --> 01:41:06.704]  You've got the glowing green monkeys, too.
[01:41:06.744 --> 01:41:06.964]  Yeah.
[01:41:07.404 --> 01:41:07.765]  Pardon me?
[01:41:08.185 --> 01:41:09.586]  Yeah, the glowing green monkeys.
[01:41:09.646 --> 01:41:10.086]  I saw that.
[01:41:10.406 --> 01:41:10.626]  Yep.
[01:41:11.346 --> 01:41:12.507]  Yeah, their blood glows, too.
[01:41:12.547 --> 01:41:15.789]  Yeah, the jellyfish they found can be put into a lot of different animals.
[01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:20.151]  And it's incredible.
[01:41:22.212 --> 01:41:28.794]  Look, last week they announced that DARPA is going to put 100 blimps in the sky with ground penetrating radar over every U.S.
[01:41:28.814 --> 01:41:32.035]  city that will just look through our walls and watch us for our safety.
[01:41:33.315 --> 01:41:36.656]  The same group that announced they're going to bet on dead soldiers and what city will get nuked.
[01:41:37.937 --> 01:41:39.317]  Then they announced that, oh yeah,
[01:41:40.217 --> 01:41:49.245]  DARPA's going to put brain scanners in on the streets, already done it in five airports, that scan your brain and see if you're hiding aggression, then the police will question you.
[01:41:49.265 --> 01:41:50.606]  This is Boston Globe, folks.
[01:41:51.767 --> 01:41:52.188]  Dang!
[01:41:52.708 --> 01:41:58.893]  Yeah, I mean, it's like we fell into an alternate dimension, and the general public's just being condescending, going, yeah, yeah, it's normal.
[01:41:59.514 --> 01:42:05.059]  Well, it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger saying in 76 on Pumping Iron that his idol is Adolf Hitler.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:15.124]  And he vacations with Kurt Voltheim last year, the Nazi, and he does all this, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center loves him, but is attacking Mel Gibson.
[01:42:17.005 --> 01:42:18.345]  Are they going after Mel Gibson?
[01:42:18.746 --> 01:42:22.187]  They're calling for a ban of it, they're calling to not have it ever in the U.S.
[01:42:22.227 --> 01:42:26.189]  or to be re-edited, and it's word for word a translation from the King James.
[01:42:26.449 --> 01:42:27.469]  It's just the story.
[01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:33.932]  Well, King James, or excuse me, Mel Gibson, I think that that guy's got some kahunas.
[01:42:34.890 --> 01:42:48.023]  And, uh, I think that he's gotten, uh, as my understanding, there's a lot of Hollywood types that don't like him because he does try to make statements, you know, in some of his movies, and in many of them he's had to finance them himself because they don't want to touch it.
[01:42:48.223 --> 01:42:48.684]  Yeah, he did.
[01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:50.385]  He put $25 million into the passion.
[01:42:50.645 --> 01:42:51.726]  Hey, Jim, thanks for coming on.
[01:42:51.807 --> 01:42:53.468]  Hey, always a pleasure talking with you, Alex.
[01:42:53.488 --> 01:42:55.010]  Good to hear from you, Mike, compadre.
[01:42:56.091 --> 01:42:58.733]  Okay, Mark keeps giving me the callers and I keep losing them.
[01:43:00.681 --> 01:43:01.041]  Who's in Ohio?
[01:43:01.101 --> 01:43:01.721]  Oh, I found them.
[01:43:02.462 --> 01:43:03.722]  Yeah, Becky in Ohio.
[01:43:03.762 --> 01:43:04.482]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:04.522 --> 01:43:04.962]  Go ahead.
[01:43:04.982 --> 01:43:10.964]  Yeah, I was trying to find out, where do you find out about this medical draft thing that Joyce referred to?
[01:43:11.204 --> 01:43:13.504]  That was the Houston Chronicle about a month and a half ago.
[01:43:13.564 --> 01:43:19.666]  It's already lined up and ready to draft medical workers, engineers to serve in forced inoculation.
[01:43:20.726 --> 01:43:24.649]  And they're going to draft all the high school kids a secret police, that's Secure Corps.
[01:43:25.069 --> 01:43:29.453]  I tried to, it's called Secure Corps, I was going to try to do a search on her line and it's forbidden.
[01:43:30.113 --> 01:43:35.837]  I went to her website to try to find it and it says forbidden, you don't have permission to access, blah blah blah.
[01:43:36.238 --> 01:43:37.959]  Well sometimes it says that when a link's dead.
[01:43:38.019 --> 01:43:45.945]  I read it on air, Houston Chronicle, type in Pentagon Proposes Medical Draft or
[01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:47.051]  I don't
[01:43:58.354 --> 01:44:03.059]  Orrin Hatch has proposed a constitutional amendment to repeal the requirement of being a natural-born citizen.
[01:44:03.099 --> 01:44:05.441]  And he said it's for Arnold, so he can be president, yeah.
[01:44:05.701 --> 01:44:06.042]  I know.
[01:44:06.162 --> 01:44:07.543]  And would you know what that number is?
[01:44:07.603 --> 01:44:09.425]  What that amendment is?
[01:44:09.565 --> 01:44:12.248]  I got the Hatch article here in a giant stack.
[01:44:12.288 --> 01:44:12.608]  Hold on.
[01:44:12.628 --> 01:44:13.168]  Okay.
[01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:14.350]  I think I just found it.
[01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:14.890]  Here it is.
[01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:16.832]  Salt Lake City Tribune Associated Press.
[01:44:16.912 --> 01:44:18.514]  Hatch for foreign-born Oakpoles?
[01:44:19.415 --> 01:44:20.696]  Robert Dirk?
[01:44:21.671 --> 01:44:29.918]  As the writer, and it says, Senator Orrin Hatch wants to terminate the constitutional prohibition against foreign-born citizens, as Arnold Schwarzenegger and others are becoming president.
[01:44:29.958 --> 01:44:34.482]  Article 2 of the Constitution says that no person is an actual born citizen of the United States.
[01:44:34.582 --> 01:44:38.765]  At the time of the adoption of the Constitution, shall be eligible for the office of President.
[01:44:39.246 --> 01:44:46.592]  Hatch is seeking to amend the Constitution to remove the ban allowing anyone who has been a citizen of the United States for two decades to run for the country's highest office.
[01:44:47.743 --> 01:44:50.445]  And they'll need a constitutional convention to do that.
[01:44:50.925 --> 01:44:53.287]  And now they're admitting they want to rewrite whole sections of it.
[01:44:53.687 --> 01:45:00.832]  And the minute the Con Con starts, the feds will launch massive terror attacks, create hysteria, they'll literally rewrite the entire thing.
[01:45:01.873 --> 01:45:02.513]  Be right back.
[01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:08.193]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.

[01:45:14.137 --> 01:45:24.524]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:45:24.684 --> 01:45:29.007]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:45:29.207 --> 01:45:37.552]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:44.216]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper, and foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.
[01:45:44.316 --> 01:45:48.798]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:46:25.692 --> 01:46:29.474]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:46:29.734 --> 01:46:34.356]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:46:34.456 --> 01:46:40.718]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.

[01:47:03.604 --> 01:47:05.285]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:07.886]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:47:08.067 --> 01:47:08.747]  It feels great.
[01:47:08.947 --> 01:47:09.948]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:47:10.068 --> 01:47:15.491]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:47:15.731 --> 01:47:17.512]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:47:17.652 --> 01:47:20.854]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:47:20.954 --> 01:47:21.634]  Incredible!
[01:47:21.834 --> 01:47:23.055]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:47:23.075 --> 01:47:26.797]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:47:27.057 --> 01:47:30.519]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:47:30.919 --> 01:47:37.424]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[01:47:37.664 --> 01:47:43.388]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting and I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:47:43.768 --> 01:47:48.432]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[01:47:51.616 --> 01:47:52.056]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:48:18.444 --> 01:48:20.225]  Yeah, I appreciate what you're doing Alex.
[01:48:20.245 --> 01:48:21.905]  My priority, I was in nuclear weapons in the military.
[01:48:21.945 --> 01:48:26.867]  My priority is to get this message across to the parents and the wives and husbands of the people over in the far Middle East.
[01:48:46.084 --> 01:48:47.805]  About this Neutron situation.
[01:48:48.126 --> 01:48:48.826]  Could I share it?
[01:48:50.528 --> 01:48:51.208]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:48:51.969 --> 01:48:59.995]  Well, if you've got Google, pull up Neutron exposure symptoms.
[01:49:00.235 --> 01:49:07.181]  You've got a bunch of research to do there, and you know we've got some serious things happening in the Middle East.
[01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:14.267]  Two nights ago, I got into a discussion with this gentleman about the Neutron situation.
[01:49:16.127 --> 01:49:17.868]  The radio, the computer radio.
[01:49:17.888 --> 01:49:20.469]  But anyway, I took the issue with him.
[01:49:20.489 --> 01:49:22.210]  You're talking about neutron bombs?
[01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.750]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:24.051 --> 01:49:31.234]  For those that don't know, a neutron bomb detonates with a radiation burst, kills all life, and then troops can roll in a day later.
[01:49:31.994 --> 01:49:37.697]  Well, the point is, sir, these gentlemen, their bodies are shut down over there now.
[01:49:39.118 --> 01:49:41.879]  That is symptoms of the neutron exposure.
[01:49:43.306 --> 01:49:53.193]  And we need to investigate this because these guys I suspect are guinea pigs for the weaponry.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:55.981]  Well, they always do that to the Tribs.
[01:49:56.041 --> 01:49:56.761]  I mean, it's admitted.
[01:49:56.901 --> 01:50:01.863]  This government killed Tribs in the 80s, put spray stuff on them and kill them, and that's the government.
[01:50:01.903 --> 01:50:02.723]  That's who runs things.
[01:50:03.023 --> 01:50:13.087]  So, but we've got the computer age now, and we're starting to learn and we're starting to be able to shut the televisions off and getting on the computer and becoming a little bit halfway intelligent with these people.
[01:50:13.808 --> 01:50:14.988]  Oh yeah, that's what's happening, yeah.
[01:50:15.428 --> 01:50:17.329]  Now, let's go to Mel Gibson.
[01:50:18.447 --> 01:50:28.192]  You know, the ADL, their pet project, and they was created in 1913, and that's the same year that the Federal Reserve was created.
[01:50:30.393 --> 01:50:41.599]  Now, we've got to understand that the ADL has power in this country and throughout the world, and if you go up against the ADL, there's no telling what'll happen to you, which I don't give a damn.
[01:50:41.859 --> 01:50:43.160]  I'm sorry, I don't care.
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:47.002]  I fought overseas, and you know, I might as well fight in this country.
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.002]  But we've got to get behind Mel Gibson and help that young man.
[01:50:53.483 --> 01:50:54.943]  He's put his resources up.
[01:50:55.023 --> 01:50:56.144]  He's put his talent up.
[01:50:57.184 --> 01:50:58.785]  He's trying to get a message across.
[01:50:58.845 --> 01:51:02.387]  And here we sit and we just talk about it like that judge in Alabama.
[01:51:05.004 --> 01:51:14.071]  Arnold can say he admires Hitler, hangs out with top Nazis to this day, defends him, and they say he's good, Simon Wiesenthal.
[01:51:14.332 --> 01:51:18.835]  And the same guy that runs it then attacks Gibson and says, don't let this film come out.
[01:51:19.115 --> 01:51:25.440]  Well, we've got to get behind Gibson and says, it's coming out!
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:31.165]  You know, if you read a book that Henry Ford wrote years ago about the international Jew,
[01:51:32.068 --> 01:51:44.038]  You're going to find that these four or five Jews that came over with Christopher Columbus, stole all of Queen Isabel's money, when they got back, you know who went to jail?
[01:51:44.979 --> 01:51:45.459]  Columbus!
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:47.621]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:51:47.661 --> 01:51:51.525]  You know, I don't think that Jews run the New World Order.
[01:51:52.025 --> 01:51:57.790]  And what I'm saying about Arnold is, the guy's an admitted Nazi and he's being defended.
[01:51:58.687 --> 01:52:00.568]  Okay, this is very opportunistic.
[01:52:00.648 --> 01:52:08.270]  And then anybody who's standing up against the New World Order, whether it's run by Chinese or Germans or Jews, is being called an anti-Semite, and that's wrong.
[01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:23.974]  And to take a book, the Bible, and to make a movie out of it, pretty standard, folks, by people that have seen it, The Passion, and then to call that anti-Semitic while defending a guy that says he admires Hitler, and who defends Kurt Voltheim, we've got a serious problem.
[01:52:25.794 --> 01:52:27.735]  And that's what I've been saying all along here.
[01:52:30.211 --> 01:52:31.271]  And it's terrible.
[01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:32.592]  It's terrible.
[01:52:32.692 --> 01:52:35.933]  And Hitler was a bad guy, and he got funded by the globalists.
[01:52:37.914 --> 01:52:41.275]  So it's a little bit more sophisticated than just one group running things.
[01:52:42.175 --> 01:52:48.038]  But it is despicable, though, to defend Arnold Schwarzenegger and then go after Mel Gibson, who's done nothing.
[01:52:49.258 --> 01:52:51.239]  All right, 3rd Hour, your calls, a bunch of news.
[01:52:51.299 --> 01:52:51.819]  Stay with us.
[01:52:54.278 --> 01:52:56.539]  Are you willing to speculate in today's market?
[01:52:56.859 --> 01:53:00.540]  Options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.080]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:11.282]  Right now, we're recommending the Perk... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.898 --> 01:53:20.538]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.198 --> 01:53:22.238]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.959 --> 01:53:24.059]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.719 --> 01:53:25.539]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.299 --> 01:53:27.239]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.259 --> 01:53:31.740]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:36.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:36.921 --> 01:53:41.002]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're now 25 seconds into the third and final hour.
[01:53:41.022 --> 01:53:46.083]  I do this show Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 Central, and then back from 9 to midnight.
[01:53:47.103 --> 01:53:48.643]  We are about to be going to, uh,
[01:53:51.304 --> 01:53:57.646]  To Lou and Tim and Linda and Manuel and Joe and others.
[01:53:58.827 --> 01:53:59.667]  So stay with us.
[01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:02.848]  Some of the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:03.188 --> 01:54:04.189]  This has now come out.
[01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:07.770]  It was Condoleezza Rice who warned Willie Brown not to fly on 9-1-1.
[01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:13.412]  The San Francisco Chronicle and others who admitted, Willie Brown admitted that he was told the day before not to fly to New York that day.
[01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:16.612]  Now it turns out it was Condoleezza Rice telling him not to do that.
[01:54:16.652 --> 01:54:18.253]  We have this on Infowars.com.
[01:54:18.793 --> 01:54:20.975]  They're going to shift over in most of the big colleges.
[01:54:21.655 --> 01:54:29.621]  They're making them Homeland Security Departments, where that's, if you want a job, that's what you gotta be, basically, to set this bureaucracy in place of the ultra-police state.
[01:54:30.361 --> 01:54:31.042]  And that's coming up.
[01:54:31.122 --> 01:54:32.923]  More on the death of Dr. David Kelly.
[01:54:33.744 --> 01:54:35.205]  Bunch of Second Amendment news.
[01:54:35.325 --> 01:54:38.047]  More on the Nazi, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:54:39.508 --> 01:54:40.288]  And I can say that.
[01:54:40.328 --> 01:54:43.711]  I mean, the guy said in the video, Pumping Iron, that he admired Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:45.723 --> 01:54:46.663]  That's MSNBC.
[01:54:46.703 --> 01:54:47.183]  I've seen it.
[01:54:47.203 --> 01:54:47.684]  I remembered that.
[01:54:47.704 --> 01:54:48.904]  I went, wow, I'd forgotten about that.
[01:54:49.724 --> 01:54:57.227]  He defended Kurt Volta when it came out that he was a Gestapo guy who killed a bunch of people and got awards for it in Serbia during that oppression.
[01:54:58.527 --> 01:55:04.789]  And he calls the former head of the Austrian Parliament his uncle who married his mother after his dad died.
[01:55:06.458 --> 01:55:07.118]  Just incredible.
[01:55:07.158 --> 01:55:11.721]  And the Simon Wiesenthal Center that he's given millions to is saying, oh, he's a good guy.
[01:55:11.741 --> 01:55:13.001]  He's a model citizen.
[01:55:13.021 --> 01:55:16.503]  We've given him awards, but they're going after Mel Gibson for the passion.
[01:55:16.543 --> 01:55:17.683]  This really makes me angry.
[01:55:18.784 --> 01:55:20.505]  So we'll be talking about that as well.
[01:55:20.825 --> 01:55:22.185]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:55:22.245 --> 01:55:24.567]  Let's talk to Lou in Colorado.
[01:55:24.907 --> 01:55:25.787]  Lou, you're on the air.
[01:55:26.027 --> 01:55:26.728]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:27.088 --> 01:55:27.408]  Welcome.
[01:55:28.101 --> 01:55:28.521]  How you doing?
[01:55:28.941 --> 01:55:29.222]  Good.
[01:55:29.502 --> 01:55:33.083]  I had a few questions here, because, you know, things go fast on your show.
[01:55:33.343 --> 01:55:37.585]  You said in Pennsylvania there was a law made that preacher cannot cite the Old Testament?
[01:55:38.285 --> 01:55:38.765]  Uh, yes.
[01:55:38.845 --> 01:55:43.727]  They said if they read passages criticizing homosexuals or others, they can be arrested or fined.
[01:55:43.747 --> 01:55:45.008]  The Republican governor signed it.
[01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.869]  Hmm.
[01:55:46.489 --> 01:55:47.770]  And where was that article?
[01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:48.750]  Governor Schweiker.
[01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:52.811]  Associated Press, CNS News, all over the place.
[01:55:53.431 --> 01:55:53.651]  Wow.
[01:55:53.751 --> 01:55:54.432]  Unbelievable.
[01:55:54.512 --> 01:55:54.992]  Last year.
[01:55:55.212 --> 01:56:00.373]  And I just read... Is that the freedom of religion to speak out on stuff or whatever and quote passages from the Bible all of a sudden?
[01:56:00.393 --> 01:56:03.654]  Well, it's just the rest of the guy who called a Pakistan person a Paki.
[01:56:04.254 --> 01:56:09.496]  And whether you're... I mean, that's just an abbreviation, but whether it is racist or not, it's free speech, folks.
[01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:09.996]  Yeah.
[01:56:10.576 --> 01:56:15.379]  You know, I mean, this stuff is just so... Well, like I say, you can see the inconsistencies on something.
[01:56:15.399 --> 01:56:21.803]  In one breath, they put programs on about the Nazis and how bad they are, and then the next breath...
[01:56:22.524 --> 01:56:29.112]  Uh, uh, you know, they're, they're, they're allowing certain, uh, people that favor Nazism, they're, they're okay.
[01:56:29.132 --> 01:56:30.534]  You can see these inconsistencies.
[01:56:30.714 --> 01:56:31.916]  It's like Margaret Sanger.
[01:56:31.936 --> 01:56:37.502]  She gave awards to Hitler, got awards from Hitler, the founder of Planned Parenthood, and the liberals just love her.
[01:56:37.763 --> 01:56:41.908]  Yeah, in two books that, uh, they had the body of secret shows that were a lot of,
[01:56:42.288 --> 01:56:42.909]  I don't know.
[01:56:57.588 --> 01:56:59.669]  And I don't like the government defending them!
[01:57:00.009 --> 01:57:05.892]  And the same thing with Bluebird, the project of Bluebird, where the guy talks about CIA stuff on mind control.
[01:57:06.292 --> 01:57:11.134]  And there again, certain Nazis were allowed in because... Well, it's like Joseph Mingla.
[01:57:11.174 --> 01:57:12.775]  They protected him for his research.
[01:57:12.895 --> 01:57:15.436]  And folks, then they say torture's good.
[01:57:15.496 --> 01:57:17.237]  Well, Joseph Mingla was good then?
[01:57:17.257 --> 01:57:17.798]  Yeah.
[01:57:18.218 --> 01:57:20.679]  As long as they help the system, it doesn't make any difference.
[01:57:20.739 --> 01:57:22.840]  As long as they can use these guys to help the system,
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:27.781]  They're good enough to use, you know.
[01:57:27.801 --> 01:57:28.182]  That's it.
[01:57:28.262 --> 01:57:31.523]  And you're now anti-Semitic if you're against Arnold, who's an admitted Nazi.
[01:57:31.723 --> 01:57:32.443]  Right.
[01:57:32.743 --> 01:57:33.963]  Notice the double think there.
[01:57:33.983 --> 01:57:37.965]  Don't stand up against Nazis, or you'll be listed as a racist.
[01:57:37.985 --> 01:57:39.805]  Yeah, I mean, it's so all over the place.
[01:57:39.845 --> 01:57:48.208]  The question is, how do you get people, you know, I would love to contact some people to call up on your show, because there has to be a way to get a hold of people that have the same views as you.
[01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:51.989]  You know, you can work to get out judges and other things that do this stuff, you know?
[01:57:52.809 --> 01:57:57.753]  I also found this guy, this book by James, The Body of Secrets by James Brantford.
[01:57:57.793 --> 01:57:59.093]  Yeah, we've interviewed him.
[01:57:59.113 --> 01:57:59.394]  Pardon?
[01:58:00.294 --> 01:58:01.475]  We have interviewed him.
[01:58:01.755 --> 01:58:02.516]  Yeah.
[01:58:02.596 --> 01:58:05.778]  I find his book though a little one-sided on stuff.
[01:58:05.798 --> 01:58:08.099]  He makes a lot of stuff, right statements and stuff.
[01:58:08.119 --> 01:58:11.422]  He gives credit to Al Gore's father.
[01:58:11.442 --> 01:58:11.842]  Stay there.
[01:58:15.319 --> 01:58:19.684]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:58:19.844 --> 01:58:24.290]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:28.815]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:58:28.855 --> 01:58:30.196]  The New World Order.
[01:58:30.977 --> 01:58:31.918]  Pan-Amerge.
[01:58:31.978 --> 01:58:36.200]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:43.184]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:58:43.324 --> 01:58:45.405]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:56.151]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:58:56.331 --> 01:58:58.472]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,

[02:01:20.536 --> 02:01:22.777]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:24.725 --> 02:01:27.986]  All right, back to open phones or calls, my friends.
[02:01:28.907 --> 02:01:31.408]  We're talking to Lou in Colorado.
[02:01:32.668 --> 02:01:34.029]  And he was talking about James Bamford.
[02:01:34.049 --> 02:01:35.149]  He wrote Body of Secrets.
[02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:37.670]  He got the Northwoods document, which the government's now released.
[02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:41.831]  And ABC News and Baltimore Sun have reported on the official U.S.
[02:01:41.871 --> 02:01:53.816]  government plan to carry out hijackings of airliners of college students, to crash them, to blame it on enemies, to kill astronauts, to blame it on foreign countries, to commit sniper attacks in D.C., and blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:01:55.544 --> 02:02:02.228]  I read a lot, and I catch inconsistencies in stuff.
[02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:06.891]  Here's the guy that's supposed to be doing it.
[02:02:07.131 --> 02:02:12.194]  You know, he has a tendency to badmouth Birch.
[02:02:12.214 --> 02:02:22.320]  He has a tendency, the way he writes, in which the right wing, always the right wing, we've got the quote in there from what's-his-name's father, Al Gore's father, who in fact
[02:02:23.318 --> 02:02:29.044]  It was admitted by, they got it on accident, was it?
[02:02:29.144 --> 02:02:33.568]  Albert Gore Sr., the admitted minion of Armand Hammer.
[02:02:33.688 --> 02:02:35.309]  Right, in the back pocket of him.
[02:02:35.970 --> 02:02:39.453]  And Hammer financed the Communists with big money.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.781]  He was loved by the Communists, and so it makes you wonder, well, was this Cuban thing... Well, this is what happens.
[02:02:45.801 --> 02:02:46.381]  Let me break it down.
[02:02:46.461 --> 02:02:46.961]  Let me break it down.
[02:02:47.161 --> 02:02:55.203]  They know we're going to find out about corruption, so they'll have a right-winger expose the left's corruption, but make sure the mass is blind to conservative corruption.
[02:02:55.603 --> 02:03:00.004]  They'll have a left-winger expose right-wing corruption, but never expose left-wing corruption.
[02:03:00.484 --> 02:03:02.765]  And the fact that at the top, they're all corrupt.
[02:03:02.805 --> 02:03:04.085]  Now, here's an example.
[02:03:04.145 --> 02:03:09.506]  Limbaugh came out, and I've got the text of his comments, and said, so what if Arnold's dad was a Nazi guy?
[02:03:10.126 --> 02:03:17.049]  You know, Joseph Kennedy was pro-Nazi, and we don't go after him, and of course he doesn't point out, well, wait a minute, yeah, and Arnold married into these people.
[02:03:17.709 --> 02:03:20.030]  You know, two wrongs don't make a right, as a caller said.
[02:03:21.371 --> 02:03:24.092]  But the point is, Arnold is in 2003.
[02:03:24.852 --> 02:03:26.333]  Arnold is hanging out with Kurt Voltheim.
[02:03:26.353 --> 02:03:29.334]  There's a photo of him on my website from last year with Kurt Voltheim.
[02:03:30.203 --> 02:03:33.026]  He's saying that he, quote, admires Hitler.
[02:03:33.666 --> 02:03:35.869]  So, you know, that's my whole point.
[02:03:35.889 --> 02:03:44.637]  But then, but then, but then, but then, Second Amendment groups and Mel Gibson and Steve Voss and stuff that
[02:03:45.177 --> 02:03:48.039]  Has never even said anything about Israel or the Jews.
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:51.382]  They suddenly are being listed by the Simon and Wiesenthal Center.
[02:03:51.662 --> 02:03:55.205]  While the same rabbi that heads it is praising Arnold.
[02:03:55.686 --> 02:04:02.331]  Yeah, I mean, you'd be listed as a Nazi if you, without a doubt, said something like that.
[02:04:02.711 --> 02:04:04.513]  And yeah, the inconsistency there is so much.
[02:04:04.913 --> 02:04:09.757]  But in his book, too, he mentions that Pearl Harbor America was caught by surprise.
[02:04:09.797 --> 02:04:12.399]  He does that also with this MacArthur thing.
[02:04:12.659 --> 02:04:13.680]  And that is absolutely wrong.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:14.240]  How can he get a story?
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:17.623]  Yeah, what he'll do is he'll take an admitted document and he'll spin it.
[02:04:17.643 --> 02:04:18.884]  But we don't go off Bamford.
[02:04:18.904 --> 02:04:21.186]  We go off the declassified documents and we read them.
[02:04:21.206 --> 02:04:21.606]  Right, right.
[02:04:21.626 --> 02:04:22.967]  Thanks for the call, Lou.
[02:04:23.007 --> 02:04:23.628]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:24.368 --> 02:04:25.629]  Tim in Washington State.
[02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:26.310]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:04:27.282 --> 02:04:27.622]  Thank you.
[02:04:27.782 --> 02:04:28.442]  Hello, Alex?
[02:04:28.562 --> 02:04:28.883]  Yes.
[02:04:29.203 --> 02:04:30.283]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[02:04:30.403 --> 02:04:34.084]  I'm a first-time caller and I've been listening for about eight months now.
[02:04:34.965 --> 02:04:39.126]  I just wanted to ask you if you are familiar with the story of Albert Caron?
[02:04:41.127 --> 02:04:41.407]  No.
[02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:52.170]  Albert Caron grew up as a ward of mob boss Vito Genovese and was himself a made man and a mob in addition to having reached the rank of colonel in the army.
[02:04:53.171 --> 02:04:54.431]  His military assignments
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:58.804]  Yeah, we know they use the mob as a hit arm of the CIA.
[02:05:15.444 --> 02:05:27.427]  He worked both sides of the war on drugs, essentially, and was personally acquainted with George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Barry Steele, Oliver North, and was himself involved with these men in CIA-sanctioned drug trafficking.
[02:05:28.267 --> 02:05:42.530]  And following an assignment in the late 80s when he and an associate were ordered to massacre an entire village in Mexico in order to teach them a lesson, Caron became disillusioned with his work and attempted to quit, but knew that he would not be allowed to do so.
[02:05:44.251 --> 02:05:48.654]  In relating this to his daughter, he stated to the effect that they'll be coming for me soon.
[02:05:48.734 --> 02:06:00.980]  Karun soon took ill with a disease of unknown etiology, which was causing brain shrinkage and causing his internal organs to liquefy, as we've been hearing with these Gulf War fighters.
[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:10.124]  And they call it pneumonia when they admit that the first guy to die called his dad and said we're hauling hazardous stuff.
[02:06:11.145 --> 02:06:11.905]  Classified.
[02:06:13.263 --> 02:06:14.603]  I just wanted to touch upon that.
[02:06:14.964 --> 02:06:27.947]  I heard you speaking with Joyce Riley on that subject a little while ago, and it's been ringing back to this story with me every time I've been hearing a mention of that, and I've been trying to get through online, and it's extremely difficult.
[02:06:27.968 --> 02:06:29.688]  I'm glad you got such great listenership.
[02:06:30.968 --> 02:06:36.710]  Well, I appreciate the call, and yeah, I'm aware of Barry Seal and the Clintons and the Bushes.
[02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:37.570]  I mean, that's all it is.
[02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:39.431]  We've got an organized crime syndicate,
[02:06:40.279 --> 02:06:46.002]  that owns Madison Avenue and the spin machines and they're selling us slavery right now.
[02:06:46.062 --> 02:06:46.683]  Thanks for the call.
[02:06:47.803 --> 02:06:49.665]  Let's talk to Linda in Wisconsin.
[02:06:49.685 --> 02:06:50.465]  Linda, you're on the air.
[02:06:50.505 --> 02:06:50.905]  Go ahead.
[02:06:50.925 --> 02:06:51.646]  Hi Alex.
[02:06:51.846 --> 02:06:53.027]  Two things quickly.
[02:06:53.747 --> 02:07:07.115]  I received a call today from a police officer asking me for funds but what was interesting is he gave me an incentive and I'm sorry I didn't get more details because
[02:07:08.005 --> 02:07:10.247]  What happened after that was very alarming.
[02:07:11.047 --> 02:07:19.513]  First of all, he told me that they would give a $300 award for anyone turning in a burglar.
[02:07:19.533 --> 02:07:25.497]  So, of course, that means you're going to be on the outlook, aren't you, for anyone that looks suspicious?
[02:07:26.398 --> 02:07:36.105]  But then the next thing that happened, I was telling him about Homeland Security and the Patriot Act 1 and so on, and about how our sheriff would be
[02:07:37.032 --> 02:07:48.001]  Brought down to the level of a police officer and that our government was bringing the police force under a militarized police force.
[02:07:48.081 --> 02:07:49.622]  And he said, oh, that would be good.
[02:07:49.642 --> 02:07:53.625]  So at that point, I talked to him about the Constitution.
[02:07:53.645 --> 02:07:54.466]  So that would be good.
[02:07:54.506 --> 02:07:55.286]  It's good in Russia.
[02:07:55.406 --> 02:07:56.327]  It's good in Germany.
[02:07:56.387 --> 02:07:58.449]  It was good in Austria.
[02:07:58.609 --> 02:07:58.829]  Right.
[02:07:58.869 --> 02:07:59.990]  I brought that out to him.
[02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:04.834]  OK, the next point is this is on the homosexual movement.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:08.802]  And, okay, here is this information I have.
[02:08:10.463 --> 02:08:18.829]  Back in April of 1999, there was a bill presented and evidently it passed, but this is what we need to find out.
[02:08:19.449 --> 02:08:24.773]  The bill was, and everyone get your pens out and write this down and do your homework, people.
[02:08:25.233 --> 02:08:31.257]  We need to find out about this, but I think this is why they're being so in our face and pushing all this.
[02:08:31.317 --> 02:08:31.957]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:08:32.117 --> 02:08:32.558]  It's HR 2431.
[02:08:35.266 --> 02:08:41.298]  And it was presented the International Freedom from Religious Persecution Act.
[02:08:44.196 --> 02:08:52.200]  Authorized or written up by Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute and he's who gave us Goals 2000.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:09:06.907]  Also he worked with Herman Kahn who was of the RAND Corporation and he also collaborated with Nina Shea of the Council on Foreign Relations from the Freedom House.
[02:09:08.868 --> 02:09:10.689]  What this legislation would do
[02:09:11.670 --> 02:09:26.444]  As it puts us, under the International Criminal Court in The Hague, it also formed a department commission to monitor religion and that was under Robert Seiple of the World Vision and at that point with Madeleine Albright.
[02:09:27.504 --> 02:09:31.385]  Yeah, of course, we covered that at the time.
[02:09:31.646 --> 02:09:40.628]  But look, that's why USA Today reported and everybody else that, oh, our Supreme Court follows the orders of the foreign courts now.
[02:09:40.728 --> 02:09:42.409]  They're the higher court.
[02:09:43.749 --> 02:09:47.593]  Yeah, there's no attorney-client privilege now, and yeah, we're getting rid of juries.
[02:09:47.673 --> 02:09:49.195]  It's the new system.
[02:09:49.755 --> 02:09:52.198]  But now, here's the twist of it.
[02:09:52.698 --> 02:09:59.806]  It says, for example, now that I'm reading from this, for example, if the practice of homosexuality becomes defunct,
[02:09:59.966 --> 02:10:05.550]  Yeah, this is they're trying to sell us the system and they're going to use neocons to sneak it through on us and it is
[02:10:21.812 --> 02:10:26.214]  I mean, I just read the article in England where the guy used the word and they arrested him.
[02:10:26.234 --> 02:10:29.096]  This is the Scotland Yard Diversity Unit.
[02:10:29.336 --> 02:10:31.377]  Now, here's what they're doing in the states.
[02:10:31.897 --> 02:10:42.523]  In the state of Utah, New York, Rhode Island, and Michigan, they passed legislation which was called neutral, what was it?
[02:10:43.283 --> 02:10:44.284]  Gender neutral.
[02:10:44.304 --> 02:10:45.365]  Gender neutral.
[02:10:45.405 --> 02:10:47.826]  They have passed that legislation.
[02:10:49.531 --> 02:10:51.893]  This is evil beyond anything.
[02:10:52.093 --> 02:10:52.473]  I hear you.
[02:10:52.493 --> 02:10:53.253]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:53.273 --> 02:10:54.454]  Appreciate it, Linda.
[02:10:55.215 --> 02:10:58.296]  Uh, let's talk to, uh, who's up next there?
[02:10:58.316 --> 02:11:00.818]  Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:11:00.838 --> 02:11:01.358]  Go ahead.
[02:11:01.938 --> 02:11:02.559]  Yes, Alex.
[02:11:02.579 --> 02:11:06.001]  First, I'd like to say, uh, latest video, Police Day 3, expertly done.
[02:11:07.061 --> 02:11:07.502]  Very good.
[02:11:07.962 --> 02:11:10.223]  Lays it out as absolute, whether you serve good or evil.
[02:11:10.383 --> 02:11:11.424]  I mean, it's two documentaries.
[02:11:12.381 --> 02:11:13.401]  Very, very good work.
[02:11:13.902 --> 02:11:17.243]  It's our longest film too, at 2 hours and 40 minutes.
[02:11:17.543 --> 02:11:18.083]  It sure is.
[02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:19.784]  When I first watched it, I watched it all the way through.
[02:11:20.584 --> 02:11:21.404]  Oh yeah, it is long.
[02:11:22.705 --> 02:11:30.687]  I'd like to say that this homosexuals, we can't call them perverts, but uh, they get on TV every day, these pundits, and they call us terrorists for speaking out the truth.
[02:11:30.707 --> 02:11:32.408]  How the double think is that?
[02:11:34.165 --> 02:11:40.887]  Well, look, it's the First Amendment, and I'll fight to the death for anybody to have the right to say what they feel, what they believe.
[02:11:41.388 --> 02:11:43.188]  But no, it's all one-sided.
[02:11:43.708 --> 02:11:45.709]  I got on this Jewish radio network.
[02:11:45.849 --> 02:11:48.110]  They were talking about the government, I think the guy's even a neocon.
[02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:51.991]  One time I tried to tell him about 9-11, how we were attacked by the globalists.
[02:11:52.091 --> 02:11:55.632]  He doesn't understand, we're under a system of indirect rule, this is all smoke and mirrors.
[02:11:56.473 --> 02:12:00.094]  And he tells me, he had another caller on after me, they were howling like wolves.
[02:12:00.774 --> 02:12:02.295]  He said the full moon must be out.
[02:12:03.666 --> 02:12:04.887]  These guys, they just don't get it.
[02:12:05.208 --> 02:12:07.010]  We're on a Luciferian chessboard.
[02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:08.051]  We've been reduced to pawns.
[02:12:08.592 --> 02:12:09.333]  They don't want to see that.
[02:12:10.494 --> 02:12:14.359]  Well, I mean, it's everybody, regardless of where they're from.
[02:12:14.479 --> 02:12:14.859]  No, no, no.
[02:12:14.899 --> 02:12:16.141]  That's not the point I'm trying to make.
[02:12:16.181 --> 02:12:20.426]  I'm just saying, he just happens to be Jewish and he doesn't get what's going on.
[02:12:21.759 --> 02:12:22.740]  A lot of people don't.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:24.582]  That's why we have to reach out to them and wake them up.
[02:12:24.862 --> 02:12:25.703]  I tried to do that.
[02:12:25.803 --> 02:12:27.985]  I even hit them with the Northwood document.
[02:12:28.025 --> 02:12:28.646]  I told them about that.
[02:12:28.666 --> 02:12:29.487]  I got your website.
[02:12:29.507 --> 02:12:31.389]  I'll prison plan it about three or four times.
[02:12:31.469 --> 02:12:32.249]  Oh, that's awesome.
[02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:33.851]  Well, the guy, he does let you speak.
[02:12:34.091 --> 02:12:34.632]  I'll give him that.
[02:12:35.132 --> 02:12:35.813]  He lets you speak.
[02:12:35.933 --> 02:12:40.798]  Hey, that's one of those shows where they'll censor you.
[02:12:40.818 --> 02:12:41.879]  They'll screen your call.
[02:12:43.477 --> 02:12:49.702]  I mean, if you're coherent and have a point to make here locally in Austin on some of these stations, they will not let you on, Manuel.
[02:12:50.123 --> 02:12:52.024]  Well, this guy, I give him credit and I told him.
[02:12:52.044 --> 02:12:52.404]  He does.
[02:12:52.504 --> 02:12:53.225]  He calls you.
[02:12:53.345 --> 02:12:55.487]  He does actually say on his show, if you disagree, call in.
[02:12:56.027 --> 02:12:56.608]  We'll give you time.
[02:12:56.628 --> 02:12:57.088]  I do give him that.
[02:12:57.108 --> 02:12:57.729]  Well, that's good.
[02:12:57.829 --> 02:13:01.692]  But, yeah, this thing where they go, oh, grassy hill conspiracy theory.
[02:13:01.852 --> 02:13:03.533]  Oh, there must be a full moon out.
[02:13:04.094 --> 02:13:05.435]  You're talking about documented stuff.
[02:13:05.455 --> 02:13:05.975]  That's crazy.
[02:13:06.696 --> 02:13:07.577]  Thanks a lot, sir.
[02:13:07.617 --> 02:13:10.799]  We'll talk to Joe in New York and others, and I am going to jump into some more of this news.
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:12.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:12.741]  Stay with me.

[02:14:52.537 --> 02:14:54.098]  Hi, Jack Rauner with Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:20.761]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[02:15:20.821 --> 02:15:23.724]  The Nasdaq was down 22% for the year?
[02:15:24.144 --> 02:15:25.505]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[02:15:25.585 --> 02:15:27.787]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[02:15:28.459 --> 02:15:33.820]  Unfortunately for many of us, the paper markets have already wiped out life savings with no hope of recovery.
[02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:35.320]  Don't let this happen to you.
[02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:37.441]  Call Midas Resources today at 800-686-2237.
[02:15:37.501 --> 02:15:42.242]  Gold Spot at that time was trading at about $275.
[02:15:42.462 --> 02:15:45.863]  It is now up dramatically and looking very bullish.
[02:15:46.123 --> 02:15:50.984]  We recommend it at that time to put a significant portion of your assets into the gold and silver collector coins.
[02:15:51.244 --> 02:15:52.644]  That advice still stands.
[02:15:53.124 --> 02:15:54.906]  Call Midas today, 800-686-2237.
[02:15:55.746 --> 02:15:59.469]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[02:15:59.729 --> 02:16:02.391]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[02:16:02.712 --> 02:16:07.655]  The time to move to hard assets is now, before the momentum buyers further escalate the crisis.
[02:16:07.896 --> 02:16:09.237]  Protect your financial holdings.
[02:16:09.517 --> 02:16:11.018]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:16:14.326 --> 02:16:16.107]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:16:16.287 --> 02:16:16.888]  I mean real!
[02:16:17.108 --> 02:16:21.931]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:16:22.271 --> 02:16:23.112]  Probably never, right?
[02:16:23.372 --> 02:16:26.454]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[02:16:26.734 --> 02:16:29.156]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[02:17:10.348 --> 02:17:13.190]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:17:28.123 --> 02:17:34.107]  We've got an article here admitting that police are going to be wired in to wireless systems to all the cameras.
[02:17:34.167 --> 02:17:36.029]  And oh, it is a federal control grid.
[02:17:36.529 --> 02:17:38.430]  Oh, it wasn't about traffic after all.
[02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:43.094]  Russian colleague doubts that Dr. David Kelly committed suicide.
[02:17:43.114 --> 02:17:49.278]  Condoleezza Rice warned Willie Brown, mayor of San Francisco, not to fly to New York the day before September 11th.
[02:17:50.799 --> 02:17:54.262]  Now founding out who called him, he admitted that he was told not to fly that day.
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.682]  That is coming up in the next segment, I promise.
[02:17:58.122 --> 02:17:59.904]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[02:17:59.944 --> 02:18:03.046]  Let's go to these quick, because there's a lot of them here.
[02:18:03.607 --> 02:18:06.569]  Let's talk to Joe in New York.
[02:18:07.209 --> 02:18:08.070]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:18:08.430 --> 02:18:08.951]  Hey, Alex.
[02:18:09.091 --> 02:18:09.871]  Nice talking to you again.
[02:18:09.891 --> 02:18:10.952]  Good talking to you.
[02:18:11.593 --> 02:18:19.759]  I'm wondering if there's any connection between the Bar Association getting together after this defeat by the IRS.
[02:18:19.959 --> 02:18:22.801]  The IRS, the lawsuit that they
[02:18:24.381 --> 02:18:25.923]  Yeah, a woman won a lawsuit.
[02:18:25.943 --> 02:18:27.144]  Tell the folks about that.
[02:18:27.164 --> 02:18:32.930]  Yeah, Coughlin, Vernie Coughlin, FedEx pilot, $920,000 supposedly.
[02:18:32.970 --> 02:18:37.074]  She didn't want to give a piece to the IRS and she went to court and she won.
[02:18:38.296 --> 02:18:41.779]  Saying that it was, using the argument, that it was a private group and a scam.
[02:18:41.979 --> 02:18:42.400]  Exactly.
[02:18:43.064 --> 02:18:44.605]  Tell folks about that, because I have the article.
[02:18:44.625 --> 02:18:45.745]  I never got into it.
[02:18:45.785 --> 02:18:46.286]  I should have.
[02:18:46.846 --> 02:18:51.808]  Well, supposedly, I believe in Memphis, Tennessee, she was brought to court.
[02:18:52.128 --> 02:18:58.571]  She was facing 30 years in prison, a $1.5 million fine, and the jury found her not guilty.
[02:18:59.052 --> 02:19:01.793]  And the funny part of it is, after they were excused,
[02:19:02.513 --> 02:19:05.754]  Well, they try to keep you where you never get to a jury.
[02:19:05.774 --> 02:19:07.655]  That's what the bar has called for getting rid of juries.
[02:19:07.675 --> 02:19:11.516]  Can you believe that calling for getting rid of juries?
[02:19:11.536 --> 02:19:13.056]  They've done it, folks!
[02:19:31.770 --> 02:19:34.131]  I tell you, they really want to set up a police state, don't they?
[02:19:34.531 --> 02:19:35.432]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[02:19:35.872 --> 02:19:42.055]  I think they're seriously in trouble with the IRS being seen as non-legit.
[02:19:42.075 --> 02:19:44.416]  I think a lot of people are going to say, oh, I guess I don't have to pay my taxes.
[02:19:44.436 --> 02:19:46.317]  Well, folks, some will say, we've got to have taxes.
[02:19:46.437 --> 02:19:48.418]  Folks, it all goes to the IMF and World Bank.
[02:19:48.499 --> 02:19:49.739]  It's not a legitimate tax.
[02:19:50.199 --> 02:19:50.840]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:52.801]  Really great points, Joe.
[02:19:53.021 --> 02:19:54.281]  Bob in New York.
[02:19:54.321 --> 02:19:55.022]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:19:57.703 --> 02:19:58.744]  Or wherever you're calling from.
[02:19:58.784 --> 02:19:59.444]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:19:59.784 --> 02:20:01.145]  How's your finger doing there, Alex?
[02:20:02.562 --> 02:20:05.625]  My finger is totally healed and the feeling came back.
[02:20:05.645 --> 02:20:10.969]  I almost completely cut my finger off about eight weeks ago and helping some folks.
[02:20:10.989 --> 02:20:21.758]  We were out fishing and this barge was stuck out in the lake and it was kind of high waves so I jumped in to swim over and I fell off the side and my hand caught in the railing and I pulled the skin right off and it was just a bone.
[02:20:21.958 --> 02:20:28.103]  I pulled the skin off the side of the boat, stuck it back basically on my finger and they went to the hospital.
[02:20:28.123 --> 02:20:29.184]  They sewed it together and
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.261]  It was numb until about a week ago, and the feeling's coming back.
[02:20:33.401 --> 02:20:34.281]  Well, that's good news.
[02:20:34.601 --> 02:20:41.204]  I bet you if Arnold Schwarzenegger did that to his finger that there'd be metal underneath it like all the movies he's put out.
[02:20:42.244 --> 02:20:52.907]  There's a new book coming out called Fleshing Out Skull and Bones, and I called a while back to find out when it was coming out, and I talked to this great guy named Chris Milligan.
[02:20:52.948 --> 02:20:54.288]  I guess he helped compile it.
[02:20:55.328 --> 02:20:58.869]  And I'm wondering if you might have him on the show.
[02:20:58.929 --> 02:21:01.990]  Boy, the guy is full of lots of information.
[02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:04.211]  And this new book is, like, real good.
[02:21:04.671 --> 02:21:05.071]  All right.
[02:21:05.091 --> 02:21:06.052]  Well, I'll try to do that.
[02:21:06.072 --> 02:21:10.533]  We know all about Skull & Bones, Satanic Order, that our Christian leaders go to.
[02:21:10.613 --> 02:21:16.835]  And they go to the Grove, and Barney hangs out, and there's lots of fun with the German Chancellor.
[02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:18.676]  Very interesting.
[02:21:19.921 --> 02:21:22.524]  The website, Alex, is TrineDay.com.
[02:21:22.904 --> 02:21:23.305]  Alright.
[02:21:24.045 --> 02:21:24.546]  Anything else?
[02:21:25.026 --> 02:21:25.547]  No, that's it.
[02:21:25.767 --> 02:21:26.428]  Thanks a lot.
[02:21:26.828 --> 02:21:27.749]  Who's up next, Mark?
[02:21:30.172 --> 02:21:30.972]  Don in Michigan.
[02:21:31.012 --> 02:21:31.473]  Go ahead.
[02:21:31.493 --> 02:21:33.415]  Hello, Alex.
[02:21:33.435 --> 02:21:34.096]  How are you doing today?
[02:21:34.316 --> 02:21:34.676]  Fine.
[02:21:35.197 --> 02:21:35.317]  Good.
[02:21:35.357 --> 02:21:37.579]  I just wanted to thank you for posting that stuff on Woodring.
[02:21:39.261 --> 02:21:39.781]  Oh, you bet.
[02:21:39.821 --> 02:21:41.063]  We're going to post the photos, too.
[02:21:41.863 --> 02:21:44.924]  I've been having real email problems the last few months trying to get stuff.
[02:21:45.164 --> 02:21:46.364]  It's been really interesting.
[02:21:46.764 --> 02:21:50.505]  I just learned how to send files over Messenger, pictures and stuff like that.
[02:21:50.805 --> 02:21:51.085]  Yes.
[02:21:51.245 --> 02:21:52.445]  There's a whole bunch more pictures.
[02:21:52.525 --> 02:21:57.786]  Yeah, I got the photos of the burnt out house where the tank smashed another mini Waco up there in Michigan.
[02:21:57.906 --> 02:21:58.646]  You got that right.
[02:21:59.206 --> 02:21:59.706]  I'll let you go.
[02:21:59.746 --> 02:22:00.947]  I know you got a few more callers to go.
[02:22:01.087 --> 02:22:01.667]  Thanks a lot Alex.
[02:22:01.687 --> 02:22:02.727]  Okay, thank you.
[02:22:03.467 --> 02:22:07.908]  Okay, and then up next is... Patty in Ohio.
[02:22:07.968 --> 02:22:08.728]  Patty, go ahead.
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:10.961]  Well, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:22:11.181 --> 02:22:17.425]  I listen to you almost every day or evening, and I'm very proud of you and what you're doing.
[02:22:18.525 --> 02:22:23.748]  Well, I want to thank the listeners for all your support and what everybody's doing out there to fight the globalists, and I'm proud of you guys.
[02:22:24.009 --> 02:22:34.455]  Well, we have gotten a lot of your videos out and gotten them into the hands of people who also feel that the hour is late and we must copy them as fast as we can.
[02:22:35.350 --> 02:22:37.171]  Yeah, but that's not what I'm calling about.
[02:22:37.231 --> 02:22:37.991]  Patty, stay there.
[02:22:38.311 --> 02:22:40.112]  We'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:22:40.132 --> 02:22:44.674]  I'm going to finish up with Patty, then I'm going to cover news for about 10 minutes, then I'm going to go back to calls.
[02:22:45.374 --> 02:22:47.054]  Call the free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:47.074 --> 02:22:50.176]  I'll actually find out who the callers are from Mark.
[02:22:50.196 --> 02:22:52.156]  He gave them to me.
[02:22:52.196 --> 02:22:52.917]  As usual, I've lost them.
[02:22:52.937 --> 02:22:52.997]  800-259-9231.
[02:22:53.017 --> 02:22:53.917]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:53.957 --> 02:22:54.717]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:23:05.814 --> 02:23:08.835]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.736 --> 02:23:12.517]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.479 --> 02:23:18.220]  Been thinking about your health lately?
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:20.681]  Of course you have, because it matters to you.
[02:23:21.261 --> 02:23:24.322]  Unfortunately, the more you look, the more confused you get, right?
[02:23:25.062 --> 02:23:28.324]  Sifting through products through 800-569-4340 or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:43.212]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:43.693 --> 02:23:46.533]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:49.594 --> 02:23:50.854]  That's right, my friends.
[02:23:50.934 --> 02:23:51.954]  Again, thanks for joining us.
[02:23:51.974 --> 02:23:56.375]  I'm about to go back to Patty and Irene, and then I'm gonna go straight into news.
[02:23:57.555 --> 02:24:03.336]  I got so much news, I'll just take these two final calls, and I won't take any more.
[02:24:03.356 --> 02:24:10.018]  Sorry to the others that wanted to get on board, but we'll have to call back tomorrow, or I guess on Monday.
[02:24:11.886 --> 02:24:16.530]  There's a lot of news and a lot of information we need to cover, so that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:17.671]  It's all very important.
[02:24:17.691 --> 02:24:21.734]  Before I go back to the calls though, I have published a book.
[02:24:22.645 --> 02:24:32.929]  I mean, I printed my own book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, covering September 11th and the history of government-sponsored terrorism and the developing police state and what their future plans are.
[02:24:33.009 --> 02:24:35.690]  It's 220-something pages long.
[02:24:35.810 --> 02:24:38.191]  It's 230, I forget.
[02:24:38.831 --> 02:24:42.092]  Only $12, full of graphics and diagrams and photos.
[02:24:42.972 --> 02:24:48.797]  But I've now published, I've printed, Paul Joseph Watson's book, and it is excellent.
[02:24:48.897 --> 02:24:50.258]  334 pages long.
[02:24:50.839 --> 02:24:53.061]  Some of the latest revelations on September 11th.
[02:24:53.101 --> 02:24:55.643]  A lot of detail on MI5, MI6 terrorism.
[02:24:55.963 --> 02:24:58.786]  Where they've been caught red-handed in their own country carrying out terror.
[02:24:59.246 --> 02:25:00.447]  Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[02:25:00.547 --> 02:25:01.548]  Homeland Security.
[02:25:02.048 --> 02:25:04.791]  How the Rothschilds are involved for mainstream news articles.
[02:25:05.171 --> 02:25:07.413]  Financing the phony UFO movement.
[02:25:08.033 --> 02:25:09.495]  It's kind of a New Age push.
[02:25:11.027 --> 02:25:12.328]  There's too much to describe.
[02:25:12.348 --> 02:25:13.669]  I mean, this book is amazing.
[02:25:13.709 --> 02:25:15.050]  You're crazy if you don't get it.
[02:25:16.090 --> 02:25:17.151]  $19.95, folks.
[02:25:17.171 --> 02:25:17.151]  $20.
[02:25:17.351 --> 02:25:20.873]  And if you get a second book, we have a package deal.
[02:25:20.913 --> 02:25:21.954]  The second book is only $11.95.
[02:25:23.455 --> 02:25:26.477]  So get a book for yourself and one for a friend or family.
[02:25:26.937 --> 02:25:28.358]  It'll really wake folks up.
[02:25:29.679 --> 02:25:32.701]  A very scholarly work, but at the same time an easy read.
[02:25:32.821 --> 02:25:33.902]  Very well documented.
[02:25:34.062 --> 02:25:37.564]  Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism, and The New World Order.
[02:25:38.507 --> 02:25:41.193]  My videos are all over two hours long.
[02:25:41.273 --> 02:25:43.657]  The newest one is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:25:44.038 --> 02:25:45.461]  They're waking a lot of people up.
[02:25:45.481 --> 02:25:46.723]  They're very well produced.
[02:25:46.884 --> 02:25:48.267]  Very shocking information.

[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:22.204]  But your friends, your family, those in your community don't know, it is up to you folks, if we're going to survive this thing, and it's coming down to that, to educate as many people as possible.
[02:27:22.624 --> 02:27:28.666]  We're hurting the New World Order, we're damaging their programs, but they're moving ahead, folks.
[02:27:29.406 --> 02:27:36.009]  So it's a fight to the death of this Republic, or the survival of this Republic, and the defeat of the New World Order.

[02:27:49.167 --> 02:27:51.768]  Alright, we also have Infowars.com bumper stickers.
[02:27:52.449 --> 02:27:55.050]  Let's go to Patty in Ohio who wanted to make another point.
[02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.750]  Go ahead, Patty.
[02:27:56.410 --> 02:28:04.013]  Well, I wanted to say first, I have two things, but the Jewish people, you know, there are about six kinds of Jews, I believe.
[02:28:04.053 --> 02:28:06.754]  I used to have a paper I passed out to people all the time.
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:14.648]  Uh, the ones that we need to be worried about are the communist Jews, and I'll tell you what, no one ever uses that word communist.
[02:28:14.888 --> 02:28:16.110]  They're still afraid of it.
[02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:19.554]  They've been afraid of it for 45 years, and I've been in this movement that long.
[02:28:20.314 --> 02:28:22.056]  They will not say communist Jews.
[02:28:22.937 --> 02:28:25.360]  Well, that's the end of that tirade that I'm on, but...
[02:28:26.465 --> 02:28:32.711]  For those that just tuned in and are wondering why you're raising this point, you know, I don't get into whether you're German or Chinese or Jewish.
[02:28:33.292 --> 02:28:37.796]  I fight evil people and the globalists are, really at their core, a bunch of Nazis.
[02:28:38.657 --> 02:28:47.786]  They're into breeding, they're into eugenics, they promote this, but the reason people are raising this is I talked about how the Simon Wiesenthal Center
[02:28:48.991 --> 02:29:07.458]  Is attacking Mel Gibson for his movie, The Passion, which is a direct translation of the Bible, out of English, back into Greek and Aramaic, and the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Hare, is saying, don't bring it out, we're going to boycott it, you better edit it, because it's word for word the Bible.
[02:29:08.078 --> 02:29:10.599]  And they're trying to claim that's anti-Semitic, when it's clearly not.
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:16.982]  Then, they're defending Arnold Schwarzenegger, for those who just joined us, we have a big section on this on InfoWars.com.
[02:29:18.129 --> 02:29:28.117]  We have Arnold a year ago visiting with Kirk Voltheim, one of the head Nazis in Serbia, killing people that saved a bunch of Jews, by the way.
[02:29:28.938 --> 02:29:34.642]  He admits that he put out a flyer distributed to thousands of people that said, kill all the Jews.
[02:29:34.662 --> 02:29:36.324]  Okay, this is MSNBC.
[02:29:37.390 --> 02:29:42.499]  Uh, we have Arnold in his movie Pumping Iron, a documentary saying, I admire Hitler.
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.702]  Now that's on the record, folks.
[02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:51.253]  Uh, we have Arnold, who in 86, when it came out that Voltheim had become Austrian President, had been UN Secretary General.
[02:29:52.354 --> 02:29:53.394]  He was this top Nazi.
[02:29:53.875 --> 02:29:55.915]  Arnold said at his wedding in front of TV cameras.
[02:29:55.935 --> 02:29:57.756]  This is in the news articles on my website.
[02:29:58.156 --> 02:30:00.456]  He said, I don't care about this Nazi stuff.
[02:30:00.636 --> 02:30:02.437]  I love Kurt Volkheim and so does my wife.
[02:30:02.777 --> 02:30:04.357]  He'll never apologize for that.
[02:30:04.757 --> 02:30:08.058]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and all these groups could care less.
[02:30:08.538 --> 02:30:11.419]  Simon Wiesenthal Center is praising him in the article.
[02:30:11.899 --> 02:30:14.140]  And then Mel Gibson makes a movie
[02:30:14.841 --> 02:30:20.143]  Where Jesus Christ, who was a Jew, was speaking out against the corrupt church, the Pharisees.
[02:30:20.503 --> 02:30:23.185]  Not against Jews, but against the corrupt leadership.
[02:30:23.565 --> 02:30:27.666]  You know, it's like George Washington speaking out against the Crown.
[02:30:27.686 --> 02:30:29.207]  He wasn't speaking out against the English.
[02:30:29.267 --> 02:30:30.167]  He was English!
[02:30:30.948 --> 02:30:32.208]  But they turned this around.
[02:30:32.448 --> 02:30:33.769]  This is what the left does.
[02:30:34.589 --> 02:30:35.770]  The communists, as you said.
[02:30:36.250 --> 02:30:39.211]  And say, oh, he's horrible, ban it, shut it down, whatever.
[02:30:40.052 --> 02:30:41.112]  This is amazing!
[02:30:41.452 --> 02:30:42.953]  And this is outrageous!
[02:30:44.223 --> 02:30:47.506]  And Arnold has paid millions of dollars to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[02:30:48.006 --> 02:30:50.589]  So, boy, I tell you, this is really seedy.
[02:30:51.109 --> 02:30:53.691]  I'm glad you're getting it out, because you're doing a good job.
[02:30:53.731 --> 02:30:57.995]  You put things into words the best way I've ever heard people really make them clear.
[02:30:58.055 --> 02:31:05.821]  Hey, hey, we stand against Hitler, and we're just wondering why Simon Wiesenthal Center is giving a big award to a guy that said he admires Hitler.
[02:31:06.747 --> 02:31:08.688]  Well, it's hard for us to understand any of this.
[02:31:08.788 --> 02:31:11.389]  It keeps our heads swirling, it's going so fast.
[02:31:11.489 --> 02:31:13.590]  But I wanted to also ask you... Hey, let me stop!
[02:31:13.650 --> 02:31:17.692]  I mean, I may be accused of being anti-Semitic because I'm against somebody that supports Hitler.
[02:31:18.152 --> 02:31:20.493]  I mean, now, if you don't support Hitler, you're anti-Semitic, I guess.
[02:31:20.933 --> 02:31:23.234]  I mean, I'm really... This is meant to confuse us.
[02:31:23.394 --> 02:31:24.015]  It's twisted.
[02:31:24.815 --> 02:31:33.679]  But I wanted to also say, did you hear the speech given on Friday, August 8th, by William Rivers Pitt?
[02:31:34.814 --> 02:31:35.014]  No.
[02:31:35.134 --> 02:31:35.615]  Have you heard it?
[02:31:35.795 --> 02:31:39.036]  I heard it played this morning on Joyce and Dave's program at the end.
[02:31:40.017 --> 02:31:45.019]  And I tell you, it brought down the house at a veterans group where he was speaking.
[02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:46.140]  What did he say?
[02:31:46.280 --> 02:31:55.005]  Well, I'll tell you, his speech should be rated up with Churchill's cheerleading speech to England to save that country, if that could.
[02:31:55.025 --> 02:31:58.507]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:31:58.527 --> 02:31:59.147]  Appreciate it.
[02:31:59.707 --> 02:32:00.988]  Let's talk to Irene.
[02:32:02.075 --> 02:32:03.416]  Irene in Idaho, go ahead.
[02:32:03.496 --> 02:32:10.558]  Yeah, Alex, the reason I'm calling, what got my attention, I was born and raised in Germany.
[02:32:10.598 --> 02:32:12.799]  I was born right into the Second World War.
[02:32:12.819 --> 02:32:22.202]  And what got my attention, when you mentioned taking the children out of their families, well, I experienced a lot of that.
[02:32:22.262 --> 02:32:28.865]  My grandmother, when I was little, she had us sit in a station,
[02:32:30.103 --> 02:32:38.467]  train station, in a wagon, because they were going to put us on a truck and haul us off, but they ended up taking us away anyway.
[02:32:38.487 --> 02:32:51.352]  They went to a doctor and told my grandmother she wasn't capable because of her heart, and they put us into a home, and during the night, I could, you know, have a long story here, but I'll make it short.
[02:32:51.712 --> 02:32:56.154]  During the night, the women, like the Gestapo women, they dressed as witches,
[02:32:56.795 --> 02:33:01.225]  You're saying they could stop it when they would terrorize you?
[02:33:06.539 --> 02:33:07.740]  Terrorized, yes.
[02:33:08.781 --> 02:33:14.625]  And also... Well, you better not criticize him, or you may be... Criticizing a Nazi means you're anti-Semitic now.
[02:33:15.105 --> 02:33:16.366]  It doesn't matter to me.
[02:33:16.546 --> 02:33:32.337]  I'm a... I'm a... My grandmother... We had... My grandmother had a neighbor, and she was a Red Cross nurse, and my grandmother told that woman, Hitler is crazy, and she told my grandmother, if you say that one more time, I'm gonna have you put against the wall and shot.
[02:33:33.809 --> 02:33:41.173]  Well, yeah, but according to them, that may be your... I mean, I don't want to say your grandmother's anti-Semitic, but standing up against Hitler may be a bad thing now.
[02:33:42.173 --> 02:33:44.314]  I'm being serious here, folks!
[02:33:44.654 --> 02:33:46.855]  It's not a bad thing for me.
[02:33:47.056 --> 02:33:49.697]  I was born into the Second World War.
[02:33:50.943 --> 02:33:54.406]  Well, ma'am, I'm getting tongue-in-cheek here, ma'am.
[02:33:55.567 --> 02:33:57.188]  Irene, God bless you.
[02:33:57.229 --> 02:33:58.289]  I'm sorry this happened to you.
[02:33:58.329 --> 02:34:01.432]  This must have been horrifying to be taken from your grandmother.
[02:34:01.452 --> 02:34:03.934]  This is what they do now here in this country.
[02:34:03.994 --> 02:34:04.655]  Franco did it.
[02:34:04.755 --> 02:34:07.057]  It is the eugenics, feudalist model.
[02:34:07.817 --> 02:34:17.045]  I'm just pointing out, what is it like for you then to see Arnold Schwarzenegger say that his idol is Hitler, that his role model is Hitler.
[02:34:17.365 --> 02:34:18.406]  That's one of the quotes.
[02:34:18.926 --> 02:34:23.550]  And then to hear the Simon Wiesenthal Center defend him, does that make you angry?
[02:34:23.570 --> 02:34:27.774]  It makes me angry, and people need to stand.
[02:34:28.494 --> 02:34:36.761]  You know, I admire your courage, and people need to have the courage to stand, stand, stand.
[02:34:37.582 --> 02:34:40.044]  And not submit to this evil.
[02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:44.568]  We're in a war of good and evil.
[02:34:45.048 --> 02:34:45.849]  What do we fight?
[02:34:46.573 --> 02:34:49.275]  We fight for the good.
[02:34:49.415 --> 02:34:50.455]  The good will win.
[02:34:50.916 --> 02:34:55.839]  Well, Hitler was big into social services, and Margaret Sanger gave awards, got awards.
[02:34:56.179 --> 02:34:56.839]  They love her.
[02:34:57.239 --> 02:34:59.140]  Why are schools still named after her?
[02:34:59.521 --> 02:35:03.003]  Because the real Nazis are supported by this government.
[02:35:03.583 --> 02:35:07.425]  And then those that aren't Nazis get called Nazis, and I am sick of it.
[02:35:07.826 --> 02:35:13.289]  Yeah, and the people need to come together and stand together and come against it.
[02:35:13.689 --> 02:35:14.970]  There's power in unity.
[02:35:15.570 --> 02:35:16.250]  Well, you're right.
[02:35:16.270 --> 02:35:19.652]  And a lot of people are waking up, but Peter Jennings isn't going to tell us that.
[02:35:19.972 --> 02:35:22.553]  They're not going to get their fourth Reich here in America.
[02:35:22.573 --> 02:35:22.654]  Yeah.
[02:35:24.054 --> 02:35:27.036]  Sometimes, you know, people, they're in a comfort zone.
[02:35:27.096 --> 02:35:28.536]  They don't want it any other way.
[02:35:28.877 --> 02:35:30.937]  I look at them like an egg.
[02:35:30.998 --> 02:35:32.298]  They haven't hatched out yet.
[02:35:32.338 --> 02:35:33.379]  They don't know nothing.
[02:35:33.619 --> 02:35:35.980]  They don't want to know because they're so comfortable.
[02:35:36.678 --> 02:35:38.239]  And they say, don't wreck my boat.
[02:35:38.359 --> 02:35:39.759]  I like the way I'm living.
[02:35:39.779 --> 02:35:41.420]  No, we've got to stand.
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:52.744]  I can, you know, maybe I get the opportunity sometimes to share my testimony, what it's been like going through, being born into a war.
[02:35:52.804 --> 02:35:57.245]  What was Nazi Germany like when you were a little girl?
[02:35:57.505 --> 02:36:05.468]  Well, when I was a little girl being taken away from my grandmother, and I must have been maybe three and a half years old.
[02:36:06.497 --> 02:36:08.277]  And I had a lot of backflashes.
[02:36:08.817 --> 02:36:21.240]  And what happened, the home got bombed, and then we were put on the street, and just the cardboard around our neck with our name on it, and shoved into individual homes.
[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:26.240]  So my brothers, we were separated at that time.
[02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:32.582]  So you remember, you talked about your grandmother at the train station when they took you away.
[02:36:32.602 --> 02:36:33.682]  Yeah.
[02:36:36.355 --> 02:36:37.376]  I don't remember that.
[02:36:37.456 --> 02:36:42.339]  That was before the doctor came and then we got taken away anyway.
[02:36:42.359 --> 02:36:43.880]  The doctor came.
[02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:46.361]  Yeah, we got taken away anyway.
[02:36:46.381 --> 02:36:51.505]  But the CPS was just doing its job.
[02:36:51.565 --> 02:36:53.846]  Yeah, but my grandmother knew.
[02:36:53.886 --> 02:36:55.507]  My grandmother stood up.
[02:36:55.607 --> 02:37:02.231]  She didn't, you know, she protected us in any way she could possibly can.
[02:37:02.291 --> 02:37:05.133]  And nowadays she'd say that she was an Al-Qaeda sympathizer.
[02:37:06.507 --> 02:37:07.208]  Well, whatever.
[02:37:08.188 --> 02:37:10.409]  She stood for whatever happened to your grandmother.
[02:37:11.369 --> 02:37:17.772]  My grandmother passed away about 15 years or so ago, almost 20 now.
[02:37:18.572 --> 02:37:20.453]  She must have lived to be very old then.
[02:37:21.474 --> 02:37:26.696]  She was 82, but what my grandmother's love is what brought us through it.
[02:37:28.536 --> 02:37:32.078]  He loved us, and her love is really what nourished us.
[02:37:32.098 --> 02:37:33.219]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:37:33.239 --> 02:37:35.881]  Did people grovel to the men in black uniforms?
[02:37:37.082 --> 02:37:37.562]  Pardon me?
[02:37:37.942 --> 02:37:42.285]  Did the people grovel like dogs to the Nazis?
[02:37:43.626 --> 02:37:44.646]  I don't remember.
[02:37:45.667 --> 02:37:48.389]  In the war, I don't remember those things.
[02:37:50.672 --> 02:38:05.157]  I know they took my brother, my older brother, he's a year older, they took his head and dunked him in the water until he couldn't breathe anymore as a child because he was so... I mean, it's just literally terrifying.
[02:38:05.177 --> 02:38:08.158]  They're the terrorists, not us.
[02:38:08.759 --> 02:38:16.442]  They're terrifying people because they want people to be scared and submit to them and do what they want them to do.
[02:38:16.482 --> 02:38:17.482]  We have to stand.
[02:38:18.556 --> 02:38:19.777]  This is not our government.
[02:38:19.817 --> 02:38:20.778]  This is an illegitimate group.
[02:38:20.798 --> 02:38:22.139]  No, this is not our government.
[02:38:22.459 --> 02:38:27.664]  And I want to tell Mel Gibson I am with him all the way and my prayers are with him.
[02:38:28.484 --> 02:38:29.905]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[02:38:30.966 --> 02:38:39.153]  Yeah, Mel Gibson making a movie about Jesus is under attack, but a guy who says he loves Hitler is being supported by the government and their minions.
[02:38:39.173 --> 02:38:40.054]  This is horrible.
[02:38:41.375 --> 02:38:42.516]  Really, really bad, folks.
[02:38:43.678 --> 02:38:44.999]  Okay, let me get into some of this news.
[02:38:45.159 --> 02:38:47.941]  Russian colleague doubts Kelly committed suicide.
[02:38:47.961 --> 02:39:00.388]  A Russian colleague of Dr. David Kelly, the British microbiologist who died amid a dispute on whether British authorities falsified intelligence reports on Iraq's weapons program, said Tuesday he doubted Kelly committed suicide.
[02:39:00.468 --> 02:39:01.289]  Kelly, a former U.N.
[02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:08.213]  weapons inspector, who was the head of Porton Down, I would add, was found with his wrist slashed last month just days after he harshly questioned
[02:39:08.832 --> 02:39:17.818]  By a parliamentary committee about his disclosure to the BBC, the British government had sexied up intelligence reports on Saddam Hussein's arsenal.
[02:39:18.358 --> 02:39:22.320]  British police have said they are not looking for any suspects, indicating they believe the death was suicide.
[02:39:22.761 --> 02:39:24.262]  Well, the media already says it's a suicide.
[02:39:24.662 --> 02:39:27.864]  Professor Sergei Rabokov, who served as a U.N.
[02:39:27.884 --> 02:39:31.026]  weapons expert with Kelly's immediate subordinate in Iraq,
[02:39:31.849 --> 02:39:37.255]  And for two years, from 96 to 98, said the microbiologist was an unlikely person to have killed himself.
[02:39:37.595 --> 02:39:40.999]  Judging by his character, I'm very surprised to hear it was a suicide.
[02:39:41.019 --> 02:39:48.927]  The scientist said from the city of Vladimir, where he heads a rare disease laboratory and research institute for animal protection.
[02:39:50.769 --> 02:39:53.372]  What really happened there, the investigation will show.
[02:39:54.674 --> 02:40:05.163]  Rabicoff recalled that Kelly was optimistic and even tempered, never losing his cool, even in the pressure of working on a team that could not always communicate well in the same language.
[02:40:06.944 --> 02:40:08.486]  Well, it was obvious he was killed, folks.
[02:40:08.506 --> 02:40:11.668]  He had electrodes on his chest, which they say has never before been seen.
[02:40:11.688 --> 02:40:14.631]  Here are some of the other news here.
[02:40:15.352 --> 02:40:16.913]  Long article on my website.
[02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:22.731]  And it says, uh, Condoleezza Rice warned Willie Brown not to fly on 9-1-1.
[02:40:22.751 --> 02:40:24.912]  That's the mayor of San Francisco.
[02:40:26.332 --> 02:40:29.993]  And it goes, uh, grasping at straws and closing a loop.
[02:40:30.033 --> 02:40:36.094]  Condoleezza Rice, the most senior black woman in the Bush administration, has leveled a charge of racism against critics of the U.S.
[02:40:36.134 --> 02:40:37.915]  drive to bring Western freedoms to the Middle East.
[02:40:38.115 --> 02:40:39.495]  Isn't that incredible?
[02:40:40.455 --> 02:40:43.056]  Then this former Chevron San Francisco employee
[02:40:43.931 --> 02:40:50.399]  Got this new rhetorical tactic from San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who has managed to turn every scandal there is into an issue of race.
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:52.242]  San Francisco election fraud.
[02:40:52.262 --> 02:41:00.312]  It goes on, white people don't want blacks to have an expensive, disruptive, mafia-owned football stadium in their overtaxed, underserved neighborhood.
[02:41:01.411 --> 02:41:01.851]  It goes on...
[02:41:22.345 --> 02:41:25.986]  That she's the one that warned Willie Brown not to fly.
[02:41:26.787 --> 02:41:30.148]  Willie Brown told the Chronicle he was told not to fly on September 11th.
[02:41:30.208 --> 02:41:32.309]  He said, oh, I got a call from the FAA not to fly.
[02:41:32.869 --> 02:41:35.810]  Now we're hearing it's from Rice, the news article right here.

[02:44:57.073 --> 02:44:59.033]  That ensures the tyrant's victory.
[02:45:00.353 --> 02:45:03.394]  They know that you want choices, so they give you a false left-right system.

[02:45:05.638 --> 02:45:07.099]  Here's one out of the Detroit Free Press.
[02:45:07.139 --> 02:45:10.702]  Police try spy cameras for better cruise control.
[02:45:10.722 --> 02:45:19.328]  And they say that they've got wireless systems hooked into their laptops and they drive around looking through all the cameras for law enforcement.
[02:45:20.669 --> 02:45:27.694]  Now the official federal documents putting in the national grid of face scanning cameras and now the banks and stores are doing it, said it was about control.
[02:45:28.335 --> 02:45:31.817]  But they sold it publicly as, oh, for traffic control and security.
[02:45:31.837 --> 02:45:33.759]  See, now it's, oh, they're going to watch you.
[02:45:34.938 --> 02:45:38.821]  And here's another article from directoryofschools.com.
[02:45:39.362 --> 02:45:41.664]  Hart's Business College Homeland Security Degree.
[02:45:42.224 --> 02:45:44.926]  They're making a UT an official Homeland Security College.

[02:45:57.797 --> 02:45:58.998]  And it says now more than ever.
[02:46:00.271 --> 02:46:15.678]  And it says that get a degree in Homeland Security to quote fight criminals, criminal justice system, emergency planning and security measures, security principles, planning and procedures, tactics, communications, domestic and international terrorism, emergency medical services, fire operations.
[02:46:16.559 --> 02:46:22.861]  And it says ethics and security specialist and it's creating this huge bureaucracy folks.
[02:46:22.881 --> 02:46:25.943]  This gigantic bureaucracy of control.
[02:46:26.610 --> 02:46:32.492]  The Postal Service has announced they're going to put RFID in all the packages and stamps.
[02:46:33.652 --> 02:46:37.473]  The big companies went to Ridge and said, make them do this in the name of terror.
[02:46:37.833 --> 02:46:39.674]  The people are boycotting us when we try it.
[02:46:40.434 --> 02:46:42.274]  The documents show Ridge said they'd do it.
[02:46:42.294 --> 02:46:49.496]  Now they're going to make the Postal Service do it to set the precedent to force these tiny trackable chips into everything.
[02:46:49.537 --> 02:46:50.957]  That's from the Associated Press.
[02:46:51.417 --> 02:46:54.598]  BBC reports, smart chips making daily life easier.
[02:46:55.862 --> 02:46:58.324]  And it says your medicine is out of date.

[02:47:03.227 --> 02:47:06.249]  So again, they want to put all this stuff in everywhere and track and trace you.

[02:47:17.936 --> 02:47:20.938]  Human Shield faces 12 years jail for visiting Iraq.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:27.103]  A school teacher went over there, protested, didn't aid anybody, just went over there and protested.
[02:47:28.404 --> 02:47:38.791]  He faces 12 years and a giant fine, but Bush and Cheney and Hillary and Clinton and all of them made money off selling weapons to Saddam during the 12-year embargo.
[02:47:39.812 --> 02:47:40.752]  But that's okay.
[02:47:42.694 --> 02:47:47.517]  Absolutely, absolutely amazing.
[02:47:48.829 --> 02:47:54.833]  And it goes on and it says here, Iraq's brutal dictatorship has been replaced by a crime wave.

[02:48:03.017 --> 02:48:03.217]  U.S.
[02:48:03.237 --> 02:48:04.858]  tried to plant weapons of mass destruction.
[02:48:04.938 --> 02:48:06.199]  Failed, wasterblower alleges.
[02:48:06.219 --> 02:48:12.883]  According to a Sunday report posted by a retired Navy Lieutenant Commander, 28-year veteran of the Defense Department, DOD, Bush Administration,
[02:48:13.807 --> 02:48:21.554]  Assurance about finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was based on a Central Intelligence Agency plan to plant weapons of mass destruction inside the country.
[02:48:22.034 --> 02:48:28.259]  Elder Rogers, the Pentagon whistleblower, claims the plan failed when the secret mission was mistakenly taken out by friendly fire.
[02:48:28.299 --> 02:48:42.851]  The Environmental List Against War reports Elder Rogers, 28-year veteran debriefer at DOD, said she became so concerned for her own safety that she decided to tell the story about this latest CIA military fiasco in Iraq.
[02:48:44.176 --> 02:48:45.737]  Oh boy, we're out of time, folks.
[02:48:45.757 --> 02:48:46.977]  A lot of news we didn't get to.
[02:48:48.878 --> 02:48:52.039]  But we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:48:52.259 --> 02:48:57.261]  And of course, we do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day.

[02:49:12.299 --> 02:49:14.481]  Think of all the crimes you know the government's committed.
[02:49:14.501 --> 02:49:16.243]  This is not a legitimate government.
[02:49:16.643 --> 02:49:17.925]  We're not revolutionaries.
[02:49:18.265 --> 02:49:19.366]  We're restorationists.
[02:49:19.847 --> 02:49:21.088]  We want America back.
[02:49:21.709 --> 02:49:22.790]  God bless you all.
