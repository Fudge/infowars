[00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:07.475]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:19.295]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:20.676]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:22.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:26.641]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.244]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:46.620]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:52.065]  It's already Wednesday, the 13th of August, 2003.
[00:00:53.406 --> 00:01:04.876]  We'll be live for the next three hours and we got a lot of powerful news and information for you today from around the world and right here in the United States.
[00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:09.280]  And we'll be going over that starting after the first break.
[00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:19.320]  In the meantime, I want to just make one more comment about the whole Arnold Schwarzenegger situation.
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.686]  I spent a lot of time on this yesterday, and since then I've done even more research.
[00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:28.128]  I've been forced to talk about it.
[00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:31.353]  Because it is the top story.
[00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:34.634]  It is dwarfing Colby Bryant, the other diversion.
[00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:44.237]  It is distracting from all the real scams, the lies about weapons of mass destruction, the globalists preparing to launch more terror attacks.
[00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:47.838]  It's smoke screening what's happening with the economy.
[00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:58.921]  And the reason that I'm so angry about this Arnold Schwarzenegger story is the guy admits that he's anti-gun, anti-family,
[00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.802]  He's for abortion on demand.
[00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:04.465]  He is for homosexuals adopting children.
[00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:09.330]  In his own book, Evolution of a Bodybuilder, he says he doesn't like Christians.
[00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:19.142]  And the Simon Wiesenthal Center is endorsing him, saying he's a great guy, because he's given them millions of dollars.
[00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:27.499]  Well, at the same time, in the movie Pumping Iron, which is a documentary, he says that he admires Adolf Hitler.
[00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:38.942]  He praised Kurt Voltheim, the former UN Secretary General and President of Austria, as a good friend who he loved and he didn't, quote, care about the Nazi stuff, was the quote.
[00:02:40.122 --> 00:02:49.664]  And then, just last year, I got a photo of him on Infowars.com in Austria with Kurt Voltheim, who was a war criminal in Serbia killing people.
[00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:56.229]  So this is very, very serious stuff, folks.
[00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.214]  And we have Arnold being worshipped.
[00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:11.181]  I mean, this shows how reprobate, how mindless, how evil the neocons are when they get on TV and radio and praise him.
[00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:15.405]  The so-called conservative websites and news services, you know who we're talking about.
[00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:17.667]  National talk show host.
[00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:25.161]  Defending Arnold, not just for the Nazi ties, but saying, so what if he's anti-gun?
[00:03:25.221 --> 00:03:28.604]  I've heard him, so what if he's for abortion?
[00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:30.345]  Oh, he's better than Davis.
[00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:31.446]  No, he's not.
[00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:33.568]  He's not a conservative.
[00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:35.629]  He's not even a moderate, folks.
[00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.815]  And again, it's a big diversion who the governor of California is and all this stuff, but at the same time,
[00:03:44.125 --> 00:04:13.540]  At the very same time, it's a great example of how they manipulate societies, of how they have double standards, because the very same head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center that is praising Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I have the quotes right here, of the London Guardian, Associated Press, Reuters, MSNBC, defending him and his real, legitimate Nazi affiliations,
[00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:28.378]  is attacking Mel Gibson for The Passion, which is the story of Jesus Christ, and it's taken word-for-word from the King James Bible and translated directly into Aramaic, Hebrew, and of course, Latin.
[00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:30.619]  That's anti-Semitic.
[00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:31.759]  That's bad.
[00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.261]  And the Simon Wiesenthal Center has attacked Steve Voss.
[00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:36.302]  We play his music here.
[00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.903]  You know, thank God for the renegades.
[00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:40.504]  Bring everybody together, America.
[00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.326]  When bullets and birth control
[00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:46.584]  Outnumber books something's wrong.
[00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:58.934]  I mean just good wholesome people are attacked by these people and but Arnold's good So you're welcome to comment on that, but I got all the news Coming up when we get back and boy is there a lot of it.
[00:04:58.954 --> 00:05:00.055]  I haven't even gotten into it yet.
[00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:06.700]  We will launch into it your phone calls And a lot more so please stay with us
[00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:12.216]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.

[00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:14.097]  Worked good for me.

[00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.299]  My stomach is not there no more.
[00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:20.299]  It's really very easy.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.420]  Helps me sleep good.

[00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.014]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:22.397]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:32.043]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:32.383 --> 00:07:37.326]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:41.672]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.

[00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.859]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:16.239]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:45.727 --> 00:08:46.808]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:46.888 --> 00:08:50.010]  Hey, this is fitting music to be talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.853]  We've got the Conan the Barbarian theme song in the background.
[00:08:55.415 --> 00:09:03.561]  Again, I don't apologize for talking about Arnold so much the last few days because it's a perfect case example.
[00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:08.085]  It illustrates everything I've been talking about for so long.
[00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:23.462]  The guy, Vacations with Kirk Voltheim, there's a photo of him on Infowars.com with the Nazi war criminal, former head of the UN, Austrian president, just a year ago in the Austrian parliament.
[00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:31.830]  Arnold's father was a Nazi police chief who joined the Nazi party when it was illegal in Austria, folks.
[00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.953]  He publicly praised Hitler after the war.
[00:09:36.465 --> 00:09:40.808]  Arnold has Hitler's middle name, Alos, in the name of Hitler's father.
[00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:44.630]  And it just gets worse and worse from there.
[00:09:44.711 --> 00:09:59.640]  At his 86th wedding to Maria Shriver, some of the other Nazi sympathizers with the Kennedy clan, he said, I want to say that despite the Nazi controversy, we support Kurt Voltheim and Maria and I love him.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.882]  These are all quotes on the record.
[00:10:03.132 --> 00:10:14.957]  The guy in the 1976 film Pumping Iron, and I'd forgotten about this until I read about it in the London Guardian, he said, I admire and use Adolf Hitler as my role model.
[00:10:15.017 --> 00:10:17.778]  He said this with total calm, folks.
[00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:19.719]  And they mentioned it here.
[00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:27.862]  I watched Pumping Iron over a decade ago on cable TV, on HBO, and by the way, it's not in the versions that are on video store shelves.
[00:10:28.383 --> 00:10:29.203]  We checked it out.
[00:10:29.223 --> 00:10:31.424]  So I've been doing a lot of research and
[00:10:32.774 --> 00:10:44.580]  Of course, I read his book, Evolution of a Bodybuilder, where he said he doesn't like Christians, he doesn't like Jesus Christ, he sees himself as a deity, we're all gods, basically.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.561]  I mean, this guy's sick, folks.
[00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:57.326]  Here he is, there's a photo on the website, it was posted on MSNBC, a photo on the website with Arnold a year ago with Kirk Voltheim.
[00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:00.336]  At the Austrian Parliament.
[00:11:00.636 --> 00:11:08.183]  Now when his father died 30 years ago, his mother married a top SS colonel who was the head of the parliament.
[00:11:08.683 --> 00:11:11.205]  The number two position in Austria.
[00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:12.527]  It's like the leader of the Senate.
[00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:13.788]  You know what Trent Lott was.
[00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:18.492]  Now with the new head of the Senate.
[00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:25.420]  So this guy is saying, during the top news story, Kurt Voltheim, former U.N.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.264]  Secretary General, turns out was a war criminal who evaded the authorities and blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:30.284 --> 00:11:32.626]  Well, they knew all along, folks, they're part of the aristocracy.
[00:11:33.606 --> 00:11:34.347]  Voltheim was.
[00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:37.589]  And he says, we don't apologize for him.
[00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:38.990]  Hitler's my role model.
[00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:41.352]  And why am I spending so much time on this?
[00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:47.937]  Because the Simon Wiesenthal Center says Arnold is a model person, the best you can be.
[00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:50.771]  A friend to Jews!
[00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:55.036]  This is amazing, folks.
[00:11:55.577 --> 00:12:07.549]  And then you see Time Magazine and it says that Arnold, it compares him to Ronald Reagan and it says that Arnold, you know, his dad was a police chief and Ronald Reagan's dad was a shoe salesman.
[00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.612]  This is getting out of control!
[00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:18.657]  And all of this simultaneously while there is a massive news blitz attacking friends of this show, the Gibson family.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.501]  Good Americans.
[00:12:24.182 --> 00:12:26.063]  Hutton Gibson, World War II vet.
[00:12:26.404 --> 00:12:28.205]  Took his family to Australia in 1968.
[00:12:29.066 --> 00:12:30.147]  Came back to this country.
[00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:35.065]  The film, The Passion, I've read the reviews of those that have seen it.
[00:12:35.386 --> 00:12:42.171]  It is word for word translation out of the King James back into Aramaic and back into Hebrew.
[00:12:42.691 --> 00:12:45.153]  And folks, it is what the Bible says.
[00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:47.015]  Jesus Christ was a Jew.
[00:12:47.915 --> 00:12:55.241]  Jesus Christ stood up to the corrupt government and the religious leaders just like Martin Luther did.
[00:12:56.862 --> 00:12:57.522]  It's incredible.
[00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:00.725]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:13.488]  And so, the very same rabbi, the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Mr. Hare, is praising Arnold in one article yesterday and attacking Gibson in another article.
[00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:17.130]  I will not stand here and put up with it and watch it.
[00:13:17.871 --> 00:13:19.852]  This illustrates everything I've been talking about.
[00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:21.914]  You're a real Nazi like Margaret Sanger.
[00:13:22.174 --> 00:13:28.879]  They name hundreds of schools and planned parenthoods after you and the black community just loves her and the media covers up for her.
[00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.351]  You're the founder of the Ku Klux Klan?
[00:13:33.651 --> 00:13:34.771]  An Illuminati chieftain?
[00:13:35.472 --> 00:13:43.955]  They leave your statue up behind the Supreme Court building, a giant statue, and black masonic lodges have a lot of them have pictures of Albert Pike in them.
[00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:45.656]  I mean, that's how crazy this is.
[00:13:46.624 --> 00:13:48.505]  We stand against the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.426]  We stand against the Nazi Party.
[00:13:50.866 --> 00:14:00.612]  And I will expose the Simon Wiesenthal Center for demonizing Mel Gibson and demonizing Steve Vosch and listing peaceable Texans for firearms rights.
[00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:03.334]  They listed hundreds of groups.
[00:14:03.374 --> 00:14:04.314]  Remember in 2000?
[00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:05.455]  Their digital hate 2000?
[00:14:05.715 --> 00:14:09.117]  Hate groups connected to Nazis and all this business?
[00:14:09.677 --> 00:14:14.160]  And you go and look at it, it's every mom and apple pie group you can imagine.
[00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:16.222]  They're all bad, they're all evil.
[00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:21.046]  Anybody who's against the UN, anybody who's for sovereignty, anybody who's for family values.
[00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:28.391]  But Arnold Schwarzenegger, defending Nazis, saying he admires Hitler, that's his role model.
[00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:34.655]  His daddy the Nazi, his mommy married to the head of the parliament who's a top Nazi.
[00:14:35.196 --> 00:14:36.537]  The guy running around.
[00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.605]  The Nazi archetypal character in movies in the black uniforms.
[00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:43.168]  And I have to sit here.
[00:14:43.448 --> 00:14:44.429]  You see, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:52.439]  When you get to the highest levels of Dutch and British and the Rothschild banking and all these people, they are just a bunch of monsters.
[00:14:53.295 --> 00:15:09.763]  And they push this whole politically correct agenda, and hate crimes, and thought crimes, and speech crimes, and... Look, I read the BBC News article years ago, where it said they're moving to ban the Old and New Testament in Europe, because, quote, the different groups out there say it's hateful.
[00:15:10.703 --> 00:15:11.663]  Their actual moves!
[00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:13.464]  Pennsylvania passed a law last year!
[00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:17.046]  The Republican governor did!
[00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:21.828]  That if a preacher reads out of the Old Testament criticizing homosexuals, he can be fined or arrested!
[00:15:23.004 --> 00:15:24.065]  Now that's on the record!
[00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:32.831]  They're trying to set up a Nazi-like system of no First Amendment in this country, and then you got these groups out there.
[00:15:32.851 --> 00:15:38.436]  It just blows me away, and I didn't mean to get back into it.
[00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:47.062]  I talked a lot about it yesterday, and we just posted a huge section on the website about it on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:52.246]  And just go look at Arnold Schwarzenegger last year with Kirk Valtime.
[00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:55.142]  Read his quotes publicly.
[00:15:56.062 --> 00:16:10.510]  And he, right up in the church, in front of everybody in 86, said, right when it was a big firestorm, about Kirk and how he was a Nazi and how he evaded the authorities and how he ran execution squads in Serbia against the people that were saving our airmen.
[00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.951]  And Arnold says he defends him and likes him.
[00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:15.852]  He said the same thing in Playboy in 88.
[00:16:18.774 --> 00:16:20.975]  Look, folks, he's given millions of dollars
[00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:22.643]  to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[00:16:22.683 --> 00:16:27.287]  He pays a percentage, right here on MSNBC, to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:31.911]  So the Simon Wiesenthal Center is defending real live Nazis.
[00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.953]  I mean, Arnold's a Nazi, folks.
[00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.114]  He said he admires Adolf Hitler.
[00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:38.196]  And that's okay.
[00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:49.726]  But Mel Gibson, who has decried Nazism in the New York Times, who, the family, again, is a friend of the show, a friend of this network, a friend of Pastor Butch's,
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.661]  Knows about the New World Order.
[00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.541]  Puts out wholesome family movies.
[00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:56.102]  Stands up against corruption.
[00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.002]  A good man.
[00:16:59.603 --> 00:17:00.523]  You know, has what?
[00:17:00.623 --> 00:17:01.544]  Seven children.
[00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:03.264]  Never cheated on his wife.
[00:17:03.304 --> 00:17:05.145]  And you got Arnold, the complete different.
[00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.605]  The complete opposite.
[00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:10.867]  With all the news reports of the stuff he does to women.
[00:17:11.267 --> 00:17:12.067]  And just everything.
[00:17:12.087 --> 00:17:13.848]  He's a 180 from Mel Gibson.
[00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:32.168]  And Mel Gibson makes a good, wholesome, historical film and puts 25 million dollars of his money on the line to make this thing, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the ADL don't want it to air here, want it to be edited, are going to boycott it, are going to try to stop theaters from carrying it.
[00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.991]  When all it is is a historical film.
[00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:46.224]  And this is amazing folks, this is absolutely amazing and it illustrates how the globalists love Nazis.
[00:17:47.224 --> 00:17:55.572]  I mean they put Kurt Voltheim, they knew good and well what he was, one of their favorite, in fact they say in the news, the all-time best Secretary General.
[00:17:57.373 --> 00:18:05.821]  Wounded in the front lines in 1942, became a head of a whole sector of Serbia during the incredible oppression there.
[00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:09.894]  It's amazing.
[00:18:10.114 --> 00:18:11.634]  It's just so unbelievable.
[00:18:12.155 --> 00:18:17.177]  Arnold Schwarzenegger said that his role model is Adolf Hitler.
[00:18:17.417 --> 00:18:29.823]  By the way, I found some more of his quotes on official Arnold-approved sites last night where it said that, I have conquered in bodybuilding, I have conquered in film, and I will conquer in politics.
[00:18:30.223 --> 00:18:33.765]  I've always been fascinated with those that control people.
[00:18:35.934 --> 00:18:37.956]  I don't want to be part of the mass.
[00:18:38.036 --> 00:18:39.417]  I want to be in control.
[00:18:40.318 --> 00:18:41.879]  I've got the quote right here, folks.
[00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:57.853]  And Orrin Hatch, for him, last week, I have the Associated Press here and the Salt Lake City Tribune, they're on Infowars.com, has introduced a bill so that someone who was not born here can be president.
[00:18:57.933 --> 00:19:02.157]  Folks, America's lenient because we were a nation of immigrants at the founding of this country, but
[00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:11.566]  Any other country, Mexico, Russia, Germany, you've got to be a born citizen to be in the federal government, period, in an elected position.
[00:19:12.227 --> 00:19:12.847]  But not here.
[00:19:12.907 --> 00:19:13.408]  No, no, no.
[00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:23.436]  Now they're saying Orrin Hatch, the gun-grabbing neocon, the Bohemian Grove neocon, says that he wants Arnold to be able to be president.
[00:19:25.117 --> 00:19:27.419]  This is unbelievable.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.422]  This is off the charts, folks.
[00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.991]  This shows how sick it is.
[00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:38.595]  So again, Margaret Sanger, Joseph Kennedy, it's fine for them to be Nazis.
[00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:40.176]  It's fine for them.
[00:19:40.196 --> 00:19:42.718]  I mean, Margaret Sanger, folks, was worse than Schwarzenegger.
[00:19:43.218 --> 00:19:43.779]  Ten times.
[00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:46.120]  All right, we got a break.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.443]  I'm going to come back and get into UK charity teaching Chechens to make bombs, say Russians.
[00:19:50.984 --> 00:19:56.587]  Ashcroft plans, Patriot Act, American Bar Association, a racist rule on informing.
[00:19:57.028 --> 00:19:58.509]  Lawyers are now going to work against you.
[00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.948]  Folks, I'll get to it.
[00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:05.290]  There's a ban on .50 caliber rifles coming up.
[00:20:05.951 --> 00:20:06.492]  Stay with us.
[00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:07.613]  We'll talk about freedom.
[00:20:11.986 --> 00:20:12.506]  It's here.
[00:20:12.786 --> 00:20:13.487]  It's powerful.
[00:20:13.807 --> 00:20:22.390]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.531]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:24.771 --> 00:20:26.871]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:31.353]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:31.653 --> 00:20:37.378]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:39.340]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.703]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.

[00:23:08.183 --> 00:23:10.785]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the CobraHead.
[00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:13.827]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the CobraHead.
[00:23:14.007 --> 00:23:19.851]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:22.252]  The CobraHead is like having a steel fingernail.
[00:23:22.413 --> 00:23:28.357]  This tool plants, scalps, cultivates, transplants, defatches, harvests, furrows, digs, you name it.
[00:23:28.477 --> 00:23:29.637]  The CobraHead can do it.
[00:23:29.898 --> 00:23:35.401]  With the CobraHead, I can make quick work out of weeding my garden beds, especially between the garden rows where space is tight.
[00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:38.063]  I love to spend time in the garden as any gardener does.
[00:23:38.323 --> 00:23:40.644]  But now my time in the garden is a lot more productive.
[00:23:40.844 --> 00:23:47.205]  The CobraHead handheld multi-purpose garden tool has certainly earned my personal stamp of approval and I'd recommend it to anyone.
[00:23:47.386 --> 00:23:48.766]  But don't take my word for it.
[00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:56.088]  The CobraHead just received the recommendation and seal of approval from the National Home Gardening Club after being tested by 200 members.
[00:23:56.548 --> 00:23:57.528]  Don't wait another minute.

[00:24:14.688 --> 00:24:16.589]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:19.991]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:22.452 --> 00:24:27.875]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 we expose hypocrisy and lies and manipulation.
[00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:33.358]  We defend against the criminal crime syndicate that is the New World Order.
[00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:35.799]  Look at this article.
[00:24:35.819 --> 00:24:37.520]  This illustrates everything I'm talking about.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.241]  A caller mentioned this yesterday.
[00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:40.041]  I never got to it.
[00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:40.481]  Here it is.
[00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:43.523]  ABA erases rule on informing.
[00:24:44.415 --> 00:24:48.398]  American Bar Association erases rule on informing.
[00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:53.102]  Lawyers can now report suspected fraud by clients.
[00:24:54.423 --> 00:24:56.644]  Now, that's Magna Carta, that's Bill of Rights.
[00:24:57.065 --> 00:25:05.952]  Your counsel is not allowed to rat you out or do things against you, but we already know they've been doing it or the bar kicks them out.
[00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:12.877]  Well now, your lawyer, the government's not just going to listen to your conversations, your jail conversations.
[00:25:14.218 --> 00:25:18.140]  With clients, they first said just in terror cases, we read the legislation, it was for everything.
[00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:21.322]  All criminal cases, including misdemeanors.
[00:25:21.783 --> 00:25:28.246]  Now they announce on the Washington Post that, oh yeah, they're going to not be working for you now, they're all going to work for the state.
[00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:30.548]  The prosecutor, the judge, and your defense.
[00:25:31.357 --> 00:25:39.919]  The American Bar Association House of Delegates voted last night to loosen confidentiality rules and allow lawyers to turn in corporate clients that are committing fraud.
[00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:44.200]  See, they know you're against the corporate corruption of Enron, so they make it sound like you're doing this.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.541]  Three years ago, the bar called for abolishing juries, by the way.
[00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:50.941]  Oh, that sounds good.
[00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.102]  They're doing that in Europe, by the way.
[00:25:54.133 --> 00:26:09.602]  The body approved the exemption to attorney-client confidentiality by a 218-201 vote at the ABA's annual meeting in San Francisco, put forward as part of the soul-searching that occurred in the wake of last year's corporate scandals.
[00:26:10.823 --> 00:26:14.966]  The new rule requires lawyers to try to address the problem with the company leadership first.
[00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:18.409]  It allows, but does not require, a corporate lawyer to go to authorities.
[00:26:18.629 --> 00:26:24.293]  The company officials are violating their legal obligations in a way that would result in substantial injury to the company.
[00:26:24.593 --> 00:26:29.577]  Well, I went and read the actual new rule, and it just means there's no confidentiality, period, folks.
[00:26:29.597 --> 00:26:30.998]  They just put this corporate label on it.
[00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:40.302]  It's our job and our public responsibility as lawyers, said outgoing ABA President Alfred P. Carlton, Jr., who lobbied for the proposal at the meeting last night.
[00:26:40.562 --> 00:26:44.765]  I'm pleased the House had the wisdom to listen to the arguments.
[00:26:44.845 --> 00:26:46.186]  Oh, the House, see?
[00:26:47.207 --> 00:26:49.268]  Private governmental body.
[00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:53.671]  By the way, licensed out of London, England, is the Barristers.
[00:26:54.651 --> 00:26:58.214]  Allowing voluntary reporting will destroy the confidence of clients and their lawyers.
[00:26:58.274 --> 00:27:07.581]  Lawyers will, in effect, have to give Miranda warnings to their clients, said Judah Beth, a Washington white-collar defense lawyer, who helped lead the charge against the proposal.
[00:27:08.202 --> 00:27:12.946]  The group will consider two more changes today that would also make it easier for lawyers to help fight company fraud.
[00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:19.031]  The proposed proposal for voluntary reporting that passed last night was by far the most controversial.
[00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:21.072]  A bunch of other horrible stuff happened.
[00:27:21.092 --> 00:27:23.054]  You can read the article at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:30.617]  So, they're getting rid of juries all over the world.
[00:27:32.157 --> 00:27:34.898]  The government's going to listen in on your conversations with your lawyer.
[00:27:35.858 --> 00:27:37.278]  And they're going to be there paddling on you.
[00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:38.859]  Now this already happens in most cases.
[00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:41.999]  You hire a lawyer from your town, you're an idiot.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.180]  Because they are working for the judge and they're playing ball with the good old boys.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.740]  It's a joke.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.101]  That's why they lose the case and have you plea bargain.
[00:27:51.033 --> 00:27:53.937]  Lawyers that don't plea bargain and use the law get disbarred.
[00:27:53.977 --> 00:27:55.699]  It happens all the time, folks.
[00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:58.543]  I have family friends that are top lawyers in Texas.
[00:27:59.003 --> 00:28:00.065]  They will admit this.
[00:28:01.987 --> 00:28:07.855]  Now, there are some lawyers that are so big and so powerful they are allowed to actually defend their clients, but that's only if they're an elitist.
[00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:11.441]  And, uh, it's just amazing.
[00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:16.765]  But the government's protecting all the corporate criminals, and then having the nerve to say this is about stopping corporate criminals.
[00:28:16.785 --> 00:28:28.533]  I mean, when they went after Martha Stewart, that's like going after a one-inch minnow, while leaving the giant whales of corruption, of derivatives, and currency speculation, and the rest of them, alone!
[00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.215]  So what do you think about this?
[00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:33.136]  We got wide open phones today, folks.
[00:28:33.477 --> 00:28:35.158]  Get your response to all this news.
[00:28:37.287 --> 00:28:38.628]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:38.648 --> 00:28:43.531]  ABA erases rules on informing.
[00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:45.432]  More on Ashcroft.
[00:28:45.552 --> 00:28:47.693]  Now it's going to be not 20 states, but 19 states.
[00:28:47.753 --> 00:28:49.214]  The city already did New York.
[00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:53.421]  Ashcroft plans Patriot Act tour.
[00:28:53.441 --> 00:29:01.446]  Attorney General John Ashcroft will embark on a multi-city tour this month to talk about the war on terrorism and the benefits of the USA Patriot Act, which will set Monday.
[00:29:01.947 --> 00:29:06.550]  Ashcroft plans to kick off a tour August 19th in Washington and visit more than a dozen cities.
[00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.192]  The exact itinerary was still being completed, will be released later.
[00:29:10.232 --> 00:29:12.474]  The Patriot Act passed a few weeks after the terrorist attacks.
[00:29:13.676 --> 00:29:16.777]  September 11th strengthened the government's surveillance powers and a lot more than that.
[00:29:16.897 --> 00:29:21.618]  Beefed up anti-terrorism laws and made it easier to go after financial bikers of terrorism.
[00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:25.860]  Critics say the law threatens civil liberties and improperly allows the government to snoop into people's lives.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.261]  Oh yeah, break into your house without a warrant in any criminal case.
[00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:35.803]  And if you touch them, you're not allowed to tell them what they were in there or you get terrorism charges.
[00:29:36.943 --> 00:29:40.204]  But the earlier article in the New York Daily News said last week
[00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:45.323]  That it is about the kickoff of the Victory Act, the second Patriot Act.
[00:29:46.804 --> 00:29:47.724]  The Victory Act.
[00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:50.086]  Victory gin, victory cigarettes, right out of 1984.
[00:29:50.186 --> 00:29:53.749]  Alright, I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:55.411]  We've got a bunch of other news.
[00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:56.772]  Big show.
[00:29:57.272 --> 00:29:58.073]  Stay with us.

[00:30:01.956 --> 00:30:03.597]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.478 --> 00:30:07.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.853]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:30:14.093 --> 00:30:17.616]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:30:32.267 --> 00:30:37.311]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:38.087 --> 00:30:40.469]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:49.475]  Alright folks, Jeffrey, John, Larry, Dennis, Ron, others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:30:51.477 --> 00:30:57.921]  And I do want to get your response to the American Bar Association saying lawyers are now going to tattle on you, you're not going to have any attorney-client privilege.
[00:30:58.542 --> 00:31:00.243]  They've called for getting rid of juries.
[00:31:00.263 --> 00:31:03.105]  I mean, you talk about tyranny, it's happening.
[00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.663]  There's a call to ban .50 caliber rifles.
[00:31:06.803 --> 00:31:08.624]  Bush moving forward with the assault weapons ban.
[00:31:10.685 --> 00:31:12.947]  This and a lot more coming up, so definitely stay with us.
[00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:20.271]  We're about, in a few minutes, going to have a little five minute update from Joyce Riley on several big stories that she's been breaking and expanding.
[00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:23.833]  Expanding on news that's also been brought up by the mainstream media.
[00:31:25.287 --> 00:31:30.689]  Before we do that, folks, you need to go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:35.131]  You need to order Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism and the New World Order.
[00:31:35.391 --> 00:31:38.853]  It's a book I have published because it needed to be seen.
[00:31:39.593 --> 00:31:43.094]  It's 334 pages long by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:31:43.715 --> 00:31:48.977]  It covers September 11th, British sponsored terrorism in their own country and abroad.
[00:31:49.537 --> 00:31:51.538]  The Patriot Act, Homeland Security,
[00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.493]  And a bunch of other facets of the New World Order, my friends.
[00:31:55.633 --> 00:32:00.478]  It is very in-depth, very well written, very well documented.
[00:32:00.558 --> 00:32:01.819]  It is an amazing book.
[00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:02.600]  Only $19.95.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.064]  And if you get a second book, it's only $11.95.
[00:32:08.165 --> 00:32:10.427]  So that's $31.90 for two books.
[00:32:10.447 --> 00:32:11.948]  $19.95 for one book.
[00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.689]  Order.
[00:32:13.169 --> 00:32:14.270]  Order out of chaos.
[00:32:14.791 --> 00:32:15.592]  Right now, folks.
[00:32:15.972 --> 00:32:17.053]  My new film is out.
[00:32:17.617 --> 00:32:19.358]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:32:19.418 --> 00:32:22.079]  It covers dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:29.362]  Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, forced inoculations, concentration camps, foreign troops, government-run white slavery rings.
[00:32:29.762 --> 00:32:31.823]  It gets into the gun control.
[00:32:32.243 --> 00:32:34.004]  It gets into just so many facets.
[00:32:34.024 --> 00:32:36.325]  There's no way to describe all the stuff in these books and films.
[00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:39.367]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny is about September 11th.
[00:32:39.527 --> 00:32:40.607]  Frankly, our best film.
[00:32:41.748 --> 00:32:44.749]  Just for the general public, you know, looks like Discovery Channel or something.

[00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:48.881]  Don't wait, don't procrastinate.
[00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:51.663]  The new film, the new book, is now shipping, folks.
[00:33:52.844 --> 00:33:53.825]  Captain Joyce Reilly.
[00:33:54.065 --> 00:34:18.079]  Joyce, I know you called in about the new Air Force uniforms, how they've gone over to the Black Berets a few years ago, this is admitted, to get us ready to merge into a multinational NATO-slash-UN force, but I gotta stop because I was wanting to get you up on the show, anyways, to talk about, anyways, despite that, to talk about, well, it came out in the mainstream news that the father of one of the people that's died from this disease that liquefies the organs
[00:34:19.314 --> 00:34:22.798]  That's nothing to do, obviously, with pneumonia, as they say.
[00:34:22.838 --> 00:34:27.425]  It's like being hit by a truck and saying you died by being shot by a BB gun or something.
[00:34:28.579 --> 00:34:29.560]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:36.344]  They're out here now saying that you had the father wrong, got even more revelations out, now others are dying.
[00:34:36.584 --> 00:34:40.967]  They got hospitals in Germany full of these guys, turning into puddles of goo, basically.
[00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:50.553]  And his son had told him right before he got sick that we're hauling toxic stuff, we're hauling something classified to Saddam's bunkers.
[00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:57.538]  Then you talked about an article yesterday where somebody in the CIA leaked it, that they were trying to plant weapons of mass destruction.
[00:34:58.098 --> 00:35:01.021]  But that the convoy got bombed in friendly fire.
[00:35:01.841 --> 00:35:10.569]  By the grace of God, everything the globalists are doing keeps getting blown wide open, thanks to this network and shows like yours, and good people that are out there.
[00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:13.451]  So, Joyce, give us a quick overview of the different stuff that's going on.
[00:35:14.132 --> 00:35:14.832]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:35:14.893 --> 00:35:19.597]  I'll tell you, we're getting more and more people from the inside that are now reporting to us what is happening.
[00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:24.641]  And I think what we can do at this point in time is realize that there is a massive program underway.
[00:35:25.439 --> 00:35:31.942]  Of course, to probably plant these weapons of mass destruction, as they've been trying to do this for quite a while.
[00:35:32.382 --> 00:35:40.665]  They've had a number of incidents that have occurred, and it is my belief that that is what the President meant when he said, we will bring the weapons.
[00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:48.829]  Well, I've heard their mouthpieces, the neocons laughing, that Limbaugh and Hannity, that quote, they've already got them, they're going to roll them out right before the election.
[00:35:48.989 --> 00:35:51.430]  I've heard them laugh and brag and say it.
[00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.271]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:59.708]  And I think that they were correct when they said, we will find weapons of mass destruction.
[00:35:59.728 --> 00:36:00.829]  There is no doubt about that.
[00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:01.670]  We will find them.
[00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.691]  Well, I think they've already found them.
[00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:15.761]  What I think is happening here is that people like Josh Nushi, and what an incredible young man he was, his family is so proud of him, but yet they have so many questions right now in wanting to know why he died.
[00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:24.328]  Now, the most, I think, significant thing in this case, to make any prior military or prior service person question, is the fact that you have a 20-year-old young man
[00:36:25.003 --> 00:36:26.184]  He was on this secret haul.
[00:36:27.504 --> 00:36:30.946]  He was hauling these toxins on the 26th of June.
[00:36:31.707 --> 00:36:40.691]  He began the mission which was allegedly classified or which the family said he could not tell them what it was because of the confidential nature of it.
[00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.473]  He becomes ill on the 30th.
[00:36:44.173 --> 00:36:49.656]  On the 1st of July, the military made him 100% medically retired.
[00:36:52.486 --> 00:36:59.672]  I mean, they retired a 20-year-old kid on a respirator in Germany without telling his parents anything.
[00:37:00.373 --> 00:37:08.059]  So this story has gotten more press only because of one journalist that says she's not going to change her story, though everybody else is.
[00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:12.883]  We've now got 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th that have been reported now.
[00:37:13.653 --> 00:37:14.054]  I don't
[00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:31.603]  They've said for months it is Mobile Weapons Labs.
[00:37:31.923 --> 00:37:35.966]  They claim the Niger document was showing uranium transfers from Africa.
[00:37:36.226 --> 00:37:37.787]  Turns out that was made out of whole cloth.
[00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:40.569]  They've been caught with fake dossiers written 12 years ago.
[00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:47.394]  They've been caught saying that mass graves were really just people in boxes of sand that had been exchanged with the Iranians.
[00:37:47.454 --> 00:37:48.235]  That was admitted.
[00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:50.797]  That was declared site in 92.
[00:37:51.277 --> 00:37:52.198]  All this on and on.
[00:37:52.318 --> 00:37:58.102]  I mean, we've been lied to so many times, but you watch, right before the election, they'll go, see, this vindicates them.
[00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:03.462]  Well, I think they've had their plans foiled for the time being.
[00:38:03.822 --> 00:38:09.343]  And that's why we're now trying to get 24 million veterans in this country on their feet and saying, enough is enough.
[00:38:10.043 --> 00:38:17.905]  The very fact that we were able to get the George Bush military record, which shows that in 1990, excuse me, that in 1972, he was suspended from flying because he refused to take his
[00:38:26.022 --> 00:38:30.025]  Uh... physical exam and that was the first year they required the drug test to be done.
[00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:41.453]  And you probably heard by now that the other person who was suspended with him, which just does not happen, believe me, in flying, is that the other person that was suspended was James R. Bath.
[00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:48.537]  And that James R. Bath, of course, is the associate of Osama Bin Laden, uh... who introduced our Busto Energy and George W. Bush together.
[00:38:48.557 --> 00:38:53.961]  And that's been... all of this has been in mainstream news, by the way, what worked on Telegram years ago about Mr. Bath.
[00:38:54.817 --> 00:38:59.319]  This is incredible that these guys are all doing this, and it's right out in the open.
[00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:00.380]  Here's the problem, Joyce.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.041]  They are telling us, look for more terror attacks.
[00:39:04.081 --> 00:39:05.262]  We want the Victory Act.
[00:39:05.782 --> 00:39:08.623]  There are discussions of arresting people that criticize the government.
[00:39:09.224 --> 00:39:11.164]  They've got to go for it all now.
[00:39:11.565 --> 00:39:20.689]  Whereas putting heat on them frustrates their plans, it also escalates their unpredictability and desperateness.
[00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:27.691]  And that's why it's imperative that every listener get on their feet and start working right now, because we've got a job ahead of us.
[00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:28.791]  Joyce, another lie.
[00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:39.874]  The former head of the Army, a scientist who was sent to whitewash in 1991 the depleted uranium problem, quit and said, this is killing our troops.
[00:39:40.195 --> 00:39:44.896]  They've got radiation holes rotted in their skins.
[00:39:45.843 --> 00:39:47.964]  Uh, you know, they're bleeding out of their intestines.
[00:39:49.445 --> 00:39:50.766]  All of the classic radiation.
[00:39:50.806 --> 00:39:53.567]  He's now done blood tests of British and Australian troops.
[00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:55.488]  He says they've been hit again with it.
[00:39:55.588 --> 00:39:56.248]  It's horrible.
[00:39:56.308 --> 00:39:56.788]  It's bad.
[00:39:56.808 --> 00:39:58.809]  This is the guy they hired to say it was good.
[00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.450]  And that's swept under the rug.
[00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:06.233]  He's supporting the troops, letting them die of nerve gas, giving them deadly vaccines that are now admitted to be deadly.
[00:40:06.893 --> 00:40:19.082]  Is supporting the troops, making them huff DU, is being conservative turning your guns in, is being conservative blanking amnesty for all illegals, is being conservative getting rid of attorney-client privileges and juries.
[00:40:19.382 --> 00:40:27.568]  I mean this is wall-to-wall evil, Joyce, and the neocons are up there laughing, saying Arnold Schwarzenegger's a good conservative when he's for abortion and gun control.
[00:40:27.969 --> 00:40:33.853]  Oh yeah, I mean they've got everybody focused on Schwarzenegger, which is absolutely a non-entity as far as I'm concerned.
[00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:37.090]  But the way that we support our military is by telling the truth.
[00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.572]  That's always the way it's been.
[00:40:38.592 --> 00:40:39.473]  You don't support them?
[00:40:40.074 --> 00:40:42.958]  You don't support them by not caring about them and just waving a plastic flag?
[00:40:43.198 --> 00:40:45.562]  That's right, a Chinese made American flag.
[00:40:46.218 --> 00:40:49.040]  And it is time that everybody get busy and start educating.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:41:11.573]  Now, we're going to be working with all of the other veterans groups, the independent veterans groups, to try and get a massive move to inform the Department of Defense that we are not going to allow him, the President, to put young women in jail because they are breastfeeding their children and refusing the anthrax vaccine when he himself refused an order to take a flight physical.
[00:41:11.814 --> 00:41:13.875]  Well, the whole administration are chicken hawks.
[00:41:15.083 --> 00:41:18.566]  Well, I'll tell you what, we're going to make some noise from this and it's going to be heard.
[00:41:18.846 --> 00:41:30.614]  I mean, it may be the last sound they ever hear, but it is going to be heard because you don't have a president who is a deserter and a deserter is defined as being over 30 days away from his duty station.
[00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:32.576]  He is a deserter.
[00:41:33.004 --> 00:41:35.929]  He refused to take... He never flew after 1972.
[00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.833]  Never flew.
[00:41:38.374 --> 00:41:42.681]  And that's because he refused to take the flight physical, which, that is denying a direct order.
[00:41:42.902 --> 00:41:45.727]  But Daddy was the head of the CIA, so...
[00:41:46.779 --> 00:41:49.781]  Yeah, and poor Michael New's father wasn't.
[00:41:49.861 --> 00:41:59.827]  So he gets, of course, dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge, and yet the president goes on, and yet George W. goes on to become president.
[00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:02.128]  But George, that shows the hypocrisy of this system.
[00:42:02.148 --> 00:42:06.111]  They're attacking Mel Gibson for his film, The Passion, that's right out of the Bible.
[00:42:06.772 --> 00:42:16.446]  Uh, and the very same head of the Simon and Lisa Dahl Center is praising Arnold, who Arnold said in Pumping Iron that his idol was Adolf Hitler.
[00:42:16.866 --> 00:42:20.772]  He, quote, saw him as a role model and supports Kirk Valtime.
[00:42:22.418 --> 00:42:24.159]  The hypocrisy of all this.
[00:42:24.339 --> 00:42:30.101]  And Simon Wiesenthal Center admitted that Schwarzenegger's father was a Nazi, that they had confirmed that.
[00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:33.062]  But Arnold says that he admires Hitler!
[00:42:33.383 --> 00:42:35.103]  Well, it is all hypocrisy.
[00:42:35.363 --> 00:42:36.524]  But it's all delusion.
[00:42:36.624 --> 00:42:37.584]  It is all a fraud.
[00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:46.068]  And we're seeing through it, and that's why I don't get as angry at it as I used to, because I see through it now, and I'm now going to start some very, very serious actions.
[00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:47.570]  We're good to go.
[00:43:01.027 --> 00:43:03.008]  And this could be anybody's son or daughter now.
[00:43:03.088 --> 00:43:05.549]  Well, now they're getting the national draft lined up, Joyce.
[00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:08.570]  Yes, and it's also going to be a medical draft.
[00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:14.292]  And as soon as the medical people learn about this, I think you're going to see a real change of heart here.
[00:43:14.632 --> 00:43:29.578]  By the way, they've got another draft now through the TIPS program where all commercial drivers, taxi cab, ice cream truck, I mean, it doesn't matter, 18 wheelers, they all have to spy for the government against all crime.
[00:43:30.487 --> 00:43:32.729]  And that's indentured servitude right there.
[00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:35.331]  I mean, they're setting up the East German model.
[00:43:36.412 --> 00:43:37.833]  Wow, I was not aware of that.
[00:43:37.853 --> 00:43:38.773]  That is pretty frightening.
[00:43:38.793 --> 00:43:42.676]  We posted that two days ago right off the government's own website.
[00:43:43.277 --> 00:43:45.939]  Joyce, what about these new uniforms for the Air Force?
[00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:49.161]  Okay, I was absolutely shocked when I confirmed it.
[00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:58.148]  It was in Air Force Times and I have confirmed it that the Air Force is now planning on the new BDUs, those are the battle dress uniforms, the ones that everybody calls the camos.
[00:43:58.635 --> 00:43:59.015]  I don't know.
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:27.616]  Because they're afraid that the American public is going to respond to this very negatively because it is the UN blue color.
[00:44:27.737 --> 00:44:33.022]  Well, the black beret is the EU-NATO model, and I've read the policy reports.
[00:44:33.283 --> 00:44:35.084]  This is about merging the uniforms.
[00:44:35.225 --> 00:44:37.287]  That's right, and that's exactly what this does.
[00:44:37.787 --> 00:44:39.129]  And on the emblem,
[00:44:39.629 --> 00:44:43.412]  Of the uniform, it says Defensor Fortis.
[00:44:43.692 --> 00:44:48.495]  It is not an Air Force emblem on the front of this cap.
[00:44:48.595 --> 00:44:58.362]  So if you see the covers that they're using right now, one of them, a BDU cap, is an 8-pointed cap, they're calling it.
[00:44:59.103 --> 00:45:03.506]  And the other one is the black one with Defensor Fortis on the front of it, and the rank.
[00:45:04.272 --> 00:45:08.414]  Now, the problem I see here is that they're going to try and integrate this very quietly.
[00:45:08.434 --> 00:45:12.875]  They're only going to put about 45 people on a base, so everybody will get used to seeing this.
[00:45:13.496 --> 00:45:20.559]  And I've even got the list of the first bases where they're going to put them on, because this is trying to integrate it into the system without people getting angry.
[00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:25.701]  The first uniforms will be seen at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, Hurlbut Field, Florida.
[00:45:26.986 --> 00:45:28.548]  Langley Air Force Base, Virginia.
[00:45:28.608 --> 00:45:30.089]  Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.
[00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:31.631]  McCord Air Force Base, Washington.
[00:45:31.671 --> 00:45:33.153]  Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany.
[00:45:33.653 --> 00:45:35.255]  And Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia.
[00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:38.018]  So that's where they're going to integrate them first.
[00:45:38.058 --> 00:45:41.441]  They signed the deals last year to bring in the foreign troops.
[00:45:41.942 --> 00:45:47.588]  Folks, Associated Press, the deals are signed, quote, if we're attacked by terrorists, they're going to bring in the foreign troops.
[00:45:47.648 --> 00:45:48.969]  We saw that at the Army War College in 99.
[00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:53.892]  And we've got the foreign NATO aircraft, the AWACS and the Norwegian F-16s.
[00:45:54.532 --> 00:45:55.833]  They're really doing it, Joyce.
[00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:59.454]  Captain Joyce Riley, we'll be watching this as it develops, and thanks for coming on.
[00:45:59.474 --> 00:46:01.855]  And check it out at airforcetimes.com.
[00:46:02.235 --> 00:46:02.896]  Or at thepowerhour.com.
[00:46:02.936 --> 00:46:03.316]  Take care.
[00:46:03.336 --> 00:46:03.736]  Thanks a lot.
[00:46:03.816 --> 00:46:04.556]  Appreciate it.
[00:46:04.676 --> 00:46:04.956]  You bet.
[00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:05.717]  God bless you, Joyce.
[00:46:06.237 --> 00:46:07.858]  Let's talk to Jeffrey in Louisiana.
[00:46:09.846 --> 00:46:15.871]  Okay, I was just listening to Joyce while you were talking.
[00:46:16.832 --> 00:46:22.137]  I just wanted to comment on the Simon Biesenthal hypocrisy concerning Mel Gibson's film.
[00:46:22.898 --> 00:46:27.202]  The information I'm about to give you is what Simon Biesenthal did not give Mel Gibson.
[00:46:27.862 --> 00:46:28.203]  In 325 BCE, or BC,
[00:46:31.269 --> 00:46:41.051]  Malachi, the last of the Old Testament prophets, convened a parliament of parliaments in Jerusalem under the nose of the Greeks who had just conquered Jerusalem under Alexander the Great and his successors.
[00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:48.313]  They had to come up with three recommendations because only 120 people at that time knew the Bible.
[00:46:48.913 --> 00:46:56.615]  The recommendations were, quote, teach the Torah to everybody, write the Torah down, and build the offense around the Torah.
[00:46:56.655 --> 00:46:57.595]  What that meant was
[00:46:58.297 --> 00:47:24.180]  That now they're going to have a class of people called scribes who had to copy the Bible down exactly as it was originally copied so they wouldn't lose any more information because beforehand the Jewish people and the Israelites had had their elite memorize the Bible and hand it down from father to son orally but now they're going to write it down and of course they're going to teach it to everybody meaning they're going to have everybody learn from a class of people called rabbis
[00:47:25.026 --> 00:47:27.207]  And then they're going to build a fence around the Torah meeting.
[00:47:27.227 --> 00:47:36.293]  They're going to build up some commentaries to aid in trying to find out what hidden customs were going on at the time the Bible was given to Moses on Sinai.
[00:47:36.973 --> 00:47:48.220]  From this assembly called the Parliaments of Parliaments came two different distinct schools concerning what was more important in the Bible.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.422]  You've heard of the Sadducee Pharisee fight, I'm sure.
[00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:53.623]  Certainly.
[00:47:54.022 --> 00:48:11.495]  Okay, the Pharisees, or Frackim, emphasized moral action and believed that a man had to save himself by his works and by his actions in terms of obeying the moral law, but they were a little not as... Okay, but Jeffrey, I'm not mad at you, but where's this going?
[00:48:11.856 --> 00:48:19.902]  Where it's going is to point out what Simon Beeson thought did not tell Mel Gibson and why their statements are absolutely hypocritical.
[00:48:21.204 --> 00:48:25.586]  Well, I mean, all Gibson did was take the Bible and make a movie out of it, and everybody's freaking out.
[00:48:25.606 --> 00:48:28.328]  You got a guy that says he loves Hitler, and they say he's good.
[00:48:28.348 --> 00:48:29.428]  Stay there.
[00:48:31.149 --> 00:48:35.471]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:40.094]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:48:40.214 --> 00:48:44.616]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:48:44.656 --> 00:48:45.997]  The New World Order.
[00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:47.713]  Panama.
[00:48:47.773 --> 00:48:51.995]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:58.998]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:48:59.118 --> 00:49:01.199]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:49:01.479 --> 00:49:11.943]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:49:12.123 --> 00:49:13.404]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:49:13.464 --> 00:49:16.205]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:34.173 --> 00:49:37.695]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:41.718]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:41.938 --> 00:49:48.102]  Black murky replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:48.502 --> 00:49:56.427]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:56.827 --> 00:50:02.170]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.112]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:06.472 --> 00:50:08.313]  And the Black Berkey filters are recleanable.
[00:50:08.393 --> 00:50:11.175]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:50:11.215 --> 00:50:15.737]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:50:15.777 --> 00:50:21.320]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:24.722 --> 00:50:28.564]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:50:29.204 --> 00:50:31.505]  As a doctor, you're able to cure and heal your patients.
[00:50:31.745 --> 00:50:34.366]  Unfortunately, there's more than that to a successful medical practice.
[00:50:34.646 --> 00:50:39.468]  Confirming appointments, rescheduling missed visits, and sending reminders is inconvenient and time-consuming.
[00:50:39.668 --> 00:50:41.829]  A team of receptionists is a costly solution.
[00:50:42.169 --> 00:50:45.310]  GTI Technologies has an efficient and manageable answer.
[00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.231]  We're good to go.
[00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.451]  Alright, folks, let's go back to Jeremy real quick.
[00:51:17.471 --> 00:51:18.751]  Finishing up, Jeremy, with your point.
[00:51:18.791 --> 00:51:19.612]  Alright, my point is this.
[00:51:43.945 --> 00:52:04.040]  That the Simon Wiesenthal Center's refusal or not giving this information, which is available in any Jewish prayer book under the title, Ethics of the Fathers, has jeopardized their view of Mel Gibson's film completely because they are guilty of contributing to the very complaint they're making.
[00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:13.688]  And, of course, their business of supporting Arnold Schwarzenegger further discredits them as far as trying to be the arbiters of anti-Semitism is concerned.
[00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:25.404]  Well, this is amazing because the film is being done in Aramaic and in Hebrew and is word-for-word out of the Old Testament that's been compared to the Dead Sea Scrolls and is identical.
[00:52:25.424 --> 00:52:31.387]  I mean, he's literally, the entire script is the Bible, word-for-word, and they should love it.
[00:52:31.427 --> 00:52:35.249]  They want to keep the language alive and this is something they study and are all into.
[00:52:35.749 --> 00:52:38.611]  It just shows that, look, they're tools for the establishment.
[00:52:39.011 --> 00:52:43.113]  The establishment, you know, a lot higher up in the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.881]  Uh, likes Margaret Sangers, likes Arnold Schwarzenegger, likes Nazis and protects them.
[00:52:49.322 --> 00:52:54.463]  And then everybody that stands up for family or decency or heritage is then labeled a Nazi.
[00:52:54.863 --> 00:52:57.744]  And I think Simon Wiesenthal, they listed Steve Voss, folks.
[00:52:57.764 --> 00:52:58.704]  I mean, we play his music.
[00:52:59.124 --> 00:53:00.505]  There's nothing about race in there.
[00:53:00.545 --> 00:53:01.605]  They had to remove it, by the way.
[00:53:01.625 --> 00:53:02.345]  He threatened to sue them.
[00:53:02.365 --> 00:53:05.006]  But, you know, we know what this is about.
[00:53:05.146 --> 00:53:08.967]  Arnold gave them millions of dollars and it's just amazing.
[00:53:09.007 --> 00:53:09.547]  Thanks, Jeremy.
[00:53:10.077 --> 00:53:14.460]  Okay, and remember this, the Simon Beasley Law Center does protect communists at the same time.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:20.563]  They wouldn't help expose the communists to anti-Semitic activities in Russia and Poland during World War II.
[00:53:20.723 --> 00:53:21.644]  I know, it's amazing.
[00:53:22.224 --> 00:53:26.947]  Again, folks, I do not support Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says he admires Hitler as a role model.
[00:53:26.967 --> 00:53:27.568]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:27.988 --> 00:53:29.028]  It's on the record.
[00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.729]  MSNBC.
[00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:33.011]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[00:53:33.651 --> 00:53:34.512]  John, you're on the air.
[00:53:34.552 --> 00:53:34.972]  Go ahead.
[00:53:36.893 --> 00:53:37.654]  I've got two points.
[00:53:37.674 --> 00:53:39.315]  Schwarzenegger and Infowars.net.
[00:53:40.902 --> 00:53:44.663]  Last week, CNN interviewed Joe Weider, owner of Muscle and Fitness Magazine.
[00:53:44.783 --> 00:53:49.845]  He said that Schwarzenegger overdosed on illegal steroids, and that's why he had heart surgery.
[00:53:50.505 --> 00:53:53.546]  And, of course, steroids routinely cause psychotic droid rage.
[00:53:54.567 --> 00:53:59.388]  CNN also showed a video of Arnold smoking pot from the Pumping the Iron documentary.
[00:54:00.308 --> 00:54:05.970]  CNN did predict that Arnold would probably be crucified for his adultery, but now it appears they're doing spin control.
[00:54:06.931 --> 00:54:08.051]  Now, a book biography
[00:54:09.814 --> 00:54:16.841]  Arnold pointed out that during his early career, he was so broke that he lived with rich homosexuals who paid him to pose nude for private photographs.
[00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:21.525]  As far as I know, they haven't been published, unlike Sylvester Stallone's porn movie.
[00:54:22.266 --> 00:54:25.329]  Today, these photos would be great for controlling a politician.
[00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:30.194]  It would also explain why Arnold likes to hang out with naked old men at the Grove.
[00:54:31.755 --> 00:54:33.377]  The other point is Infowars.net.
[00:54:34.454 --> 00:54:46.079]  My former ISP was AT&T, Comcast, Scripps Howard of Bohemian Grove, but they censored my email ISP and canceled it for reposting a Reuters article from Infowars.com.
[00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:52.382]  I'd also sent similar news items to Project Censored about Infowars.com.
[00:54:53.122 --> 00:54:56.583]  And then Dreamhost.com censored my website for the same alleged crime.
[00:54:57.364 --> 00:55:02.906]  My website discussed our skull and bones mayor who's trying to give Scripps Howard a billion dollars in corporate welfare.
[00:55:03.895 --> 00:55:08.639]  Then I switched to free AOL using the free CDs advertised by the U.S.
[00:55:08.699 --> 00:55:09.359]  Post Office.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:16.305]  Then AOL's customer support reps in India slammed me for $140 a month in bogus charges.
[00:55:16.965 --> 00:55:23.290]  A bank canceled AOL's bogus debt, but AOL's CNN keeps sending me bogus invoices.
[00:55:24.251 --> 00:55:29.615]  And coincidentally, when I removed AOL from my computer, my printer died and I had to buy a new computer and printer.
[00:55:30.137 --> 00:55:34.918]  So I look forward to safe surfing and an uncensored use of Infowars.net.
[00:55:35.218 --> 00:55:49.661]  Wow, well it sounds like you wrote that, and I appreciate the commercial, but yeah, we have virtual browsers where your anonymity is protected, it's less than these other services, and it's a great dial-up, and we offer other things as well, and I hope folks will go sign up at Infowars.net.
[00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:57.062]  Well, if anybody wants to read my censored website, there's a link from Infowars.com on the 911 page, September 911 Surprise.
[00:55:58.163 --> 00:55:59.663]  Alright, thank you so much, sir.
[00:56:00.674 --> 00:56:02.075]  Appreciate it, John.
[00:56:03.375 --> 00:56:05.717]  Larry and Dennis and Ron and others, you're up next.
[00:56:07.638 --> 00:56:10.159]  And yeah, the stuff he was saying about Arnold and the old men.
[00:56:10.219 --> 00:56:11.980]  I mean, that's been in the papers before.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.761]  I'm not going to get off into it.
[00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:15.782]  We know what goes on at the Grove, folks.
[00:56:16.042 --> 00:56:17.203]  It's just we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:56:17.843 --> 00:56:18.944]  This is your Neocon.
[00:56:21.622 --> 00:56:30.249]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:56:30.469 --> 00:56:39.556]  The BerkeyLite self-sterilizing... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.891]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:49.592]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.312 --> 00:56:51.453]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.073 --> 00:56:52.894]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.634 --> 00:56:54.535]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.555 --> 00:56:58.838]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.398 --> 00:57:03.521]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.762 --> 00:57:08.504]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:08.544 --> 00:57:09.745]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:57:11.466 --> 00:57:14.928]  On the show, it is the 13th of August, 2003.
[00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.691]  We're going to have wide open phones and I'm about to get into some more of the news.
[00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:25.713]  I already talked about the American Bar Association's announcement of getting rid of attorney-client privilege.
[00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:27.534]  They want to get rid of juries as well.
[00:57:28.494 --> 00:57:32.876]  Contra Coast takes aim at .50 caliber rifles.
[00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:36.077]  Contra Coast County Supervisors are taking aim at .50 caliber rifles.
[00:57:36.117 --> 00:57:38.298]  The board is concerned that the powerful
[00:57:39.726 --> 00:57:50.128]  Air rifles, that's right, that the powerful rifles, excuse me, could be used to shoot at refinery targets, chemical plants, and trains in the county.
[00:57:50.448 --> 00:57:58.510]  So, see, we have this advertisement by the government that terrorists are going to use .50 calibers, we've got to ban them, and in California they're trying to ban below .40 caliber handguns.
[00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:04.531]  The rifles use the same ammunition fired by powerful military machine guns, blah blah blah.
[00:58:05.504 --> 00:58:10.347]  The rifles in question are not automatic weapons, but are most often used by target shooters or hunters.
[00:58:11.028 --> 00:58:16.531]  If the board approves an ordinance banning the guns today, it will be the first county in California to take such a step.
[00:58:16.551 --> 00:58:18.492]  Los Angeles banned the guns in June.
[00:58:19.653 --> 00:58:27.578]  Chuck Michaels, a spokesman for the California Rifle and Pistol Association, says the claims made by the gun, that the bullets can penetrate 8 inches of concrete, for instance, are baloney.
[00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:33.082]  He says the gun would be like a pea shooter for terrorists who would have access to illegal weapons and explosives.
[00:58:33.122 --> 00:58:34.943]  He calls the ban a part of an anti-gun movement.
[00:58:35.726 --> 00:58:37.066]  So we'll get in more into that.
[00:58:37.586 --> 00:58:43.568]  Again, Jewish group attacks Gibson Film, but doesn't mind Arnold who's sat on national TV, admires Hitler.
[00:58:45.048 --> 00:58:51.669]  Jolted over election voting, electronic voting, more articles admitting that touchscreens are totally fraud based and don't work.
[00:58:53.029 --> 00:59:01.071]  Smart bomb technology moving to China, Pentagon brushes aside concerns of national security will be threatened as they arm real enemies of America.
[00:59:03.304 --> 00:59:07.128]  Also, man accused of improperly storing gunpowder, denied bail.
[00:59:07.868 --> 00:59:09.710]  Wheeler pleads guilty to arraignment.
[00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.371]  Faces November 7th trial date.
[00:59:11.391 --> 00:59:19.538]  So they're going after people who store gunpowder, but the borders are wide open and the Chinese government's been caught chipping in machine guns and laws rockets and opium.
[00:59:19.578 --> 00:59:20.138]  Nothing happens.
[00:59:21.319 --> 00:59:24.682]  We'll also get in to bring us home.
[00:59:24.722 --> 00:59:25.863]  GI's flood U.S.
[00:59:26.304 --> 00:59:27.905]  with war-weary emails.
[00:59:28.686 --> 00:59:31.108]  Sick veteran battles bureaucracy back home.
[00:59:32.325 --> 00:59:42.714]  We've got a bunch of other articles here about a man jailed over adding something onto his house through federal controls.
[00:59:42.735 --> 00:59:51.682]  They're getting states and cities to pass zoning laws that are a whole new level of tyranny where you face years in jail, but you can't even have a jury because it's a petty crime.
[00:59:51.702 --> 00:59:52.503]  It's hard to get this.
[00:59:55.353 --> 01:00:00.096]  Racist faces jail under first British court order to ban use of a word.
[01:00:00.116 --> 01:00:01.816]  We'll cover that first when we get back.
[01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:04.998]  Nylon relatives want to make National Service Day.
[01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:08.880]  So they want to make us slaves of the government that's been carrying out the terror.
[01:00:10.001 --> 01:00:12.682]  And it's all coming up, folks.
[01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:18.465]  We've got some good news, some good things that are happening as well.
[01:00:18.505 --> 01:00:20.626]  But first, we will get to some more of your calls.
[01:00:21.347 --> 01:00:23.788]  When we get back, on the other side of this quick break,
[01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:26.182]  We've got one phone line open.
[01:00:26.202 --> 01:00:30.845]  If you want to join us on air on any of these issues, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:30.865 --> 01:00:32.646]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:42.553]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:00:42.753 --> 01:00:44.394]  And the caller mentioned that CNN piece.
[01:00:44.454 --> 01:00:45.175]  I did read about it.
[01:00:45.515 --> 01:00:49.798]  Did you see it where they talked about Joe Weiner who brought Arnold
[01:00:51.989 --> 01:00:53.010]  To the U.S.
[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:56.112]  as he had the heart problems because of steroid overdoses?
[01:00:57.373 --> 01:00:58.855]  Man, that's interesting.
[01:00:59.815 --> 01:01:05.040]  I mean, it's obvious Arnold was on steroids, folks, the way he puffed up and got smaller and got, you know, all that stuff.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.564]  And that's been admitted, but I don't want to get off into Arnold all day, but people want to talk about it, so we'll talk about it.
[01:01:10.944 --> 01:01:13.466]  The hypocrisy, the incredible double standards, you name it.
[01:01:13.487 --> 01:01:13.547]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:18.334 --> 01:01:23.197]  Your calls and a lot more news coming at you right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:29.301]  And be sure to read all these articles we post daily at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:29.341 --> 01:01:38.327]  I keep plugging those sites because there's a lot of folks tuning into the AM and FM dial for the first time here on this show and I want them to check out the sites and see the documentation for themselves.
[01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:39.588]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:39.968]  Stay with us.
[01:01:42.674 --> 01:01:44.635]  You've asked for them, and now they're here!
[01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:55.438]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:01:55.818 --> 01:02:00.339]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:02:00.399 --> 01:02:11.722]  When used, water flows through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:02:12.322 --> 01:02:19.165]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:02:19.586 --> 01:02:21.707]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:02:22.207 --> 01:02:27.189]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:33.632]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:47.164]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:47.344 --> 01:02:51.788]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:51.908 --> 01:02:56.312]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:56.352 --> 01:02:57.654]  The New World Order.
[01:02:58.454 --> 01:02:59.374]  Panama.
[01:02:59.454 --> 01:03:03.676]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:10.658]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:10.798 --> 01:03:12.879]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:23.302]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:23.802 --> 01:03:29.164]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new 2.5 hour video, Police Take 3, is for you!

[01:03:32.125 --> 01:03:33.025]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:03:42.108 --> 01:03:42.428]  I think so.
[01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:02.805]  I think so.
[01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:22.853]  My soil is richer, my air is cleaner, and most importantly, my children are healthier because of organic gardening.
[01:04:23.073 --> 01:04:25.194]  It's such a simple way to make this world a better place.
[01:04:25.414 --> 01:04:27.796]  So call Sherry and the good folks at Arbico today at 1-800-827-2847.

[01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:32.238]  Saving the world has never been this simple because Arbico is organic gardening made easy.
[01:04:47.253 --> 01:04:47.893]  Big Brother.
[01:04:48.574 --> 01:04:49.614]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:50.335 --> 01:04:51.435]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:52.916]  You want answers?
[01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:54.597]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:54.617 --> 01:04:59.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:03.542]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:06.664 --> 01:05:08.385]  Citizens are standing up.
[01:05:08.445 --> 01:05:09.525]  They are fighting back.
[01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:14.088]  In Texas a few years ago, a former prosecutor, lawyer,
[01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:18.938]  He put up a sign on his ranch saying that you can say no to searches.
[01:05:18.978 --> 01:05:27.731]  It's a Fourth Amendment violation with a phone number you called and it would give you the history of the Fourth Amendment and a brief two-minute message.
[01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:29.834]  And when we had Mr. Barber on the show,
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.061]  Then the state police said, we don't care if there's McDonald's signs right down the road.
[01:05:35.121 --> 01:05:36.401]  We don't care if there's not a law.
[01:05:36.901 --> 01:05:38.242]  You can't have that sign.
[01:05:38.962 --> 01:05:41.002]  And indicted him, went after him.
[01:05:41.042 --> 01:05:41.743]  He had to take it down.
[01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:43.723]  But now across the country, others are doing it.
[01:05:44.203 --> 01:05:45.524]  And the police are having to back down.
[01:05:45.544 --> 01:05:47.004]  This is out of the Gainesville News.
[01:05:48.004 --> 01:05:50.665]  And it says, Billboards warrant of speed trap.
[01:05:51.938 --> 01:06:01.281]  And this is part of what the AAA is doing because they say police are harassing people, feeding on them.
[01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:03.642]  That's why Mr. Barber put the sign up.
[01:06:03.662 --> 01:06:08.343]  He'd see families at their church with their goods thrown on the road by the state police in Texas.
[01:06:09.023 --> 01:06:10.024]  This is in Florida.
[01:06:11.644 --> 01:06:13.765]  And he was outraged by it.
[01:06:14.585 --> 01:06:17.486]  They'll throw your goods on the road and then have you pick it up.
[01:06:18.446 --> 01:06:19.526]  That's America, folks.
[01:06:19.566 --> 01:06:20.267]  Here's another one.
[01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:21.347]  Dispute over
[01:06:22.535 --> 01:06:25.416]  Uh, who prompted man to disrobe at Lauderdale Airport?
[01:06:26.477 --> 01:06:38.522]  And, uh, it says here, a man who's a security guard at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport ordered him to remove his pants and then fed them through the x-ray machine as bystanders watched him stand there humiliated in his boxer shorts.
[01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:51.248]  Well, Lou Rockwell, one of his writers wrote about, a well-known writer, his eight-and-a-half-month-old pregnant wife, right in front of everyone, they made her take her clothes off down to her panties with her belly hanging out.
[01:06:52.412 --> 01:06:54.434]  And then the husband said, how dare you do this?
[01:06:54.454 --> 01:06:55.334]  She started crying.
[01:06:55.354 --> 01:06:56.235]  And he said, how dare you?
[01:06:56.295 --> 01:07:02.240]  As they made fun of her, basically standing there naked, you know, down to her bra and panties in front of hundreds of people.
[01:07:02.781 --> 01:07:04.002]  And so they arrested him.
[01:07:04.442 --> 01:07:07.544]  And then later when he started suing them, they said, oh, we found a knife in your bag.
[01:07:07.564 --> 01:07:08.465]  They never said at the time.
[01:07:08.485 --> 01:07:09.406]  It was obviously made up.
[01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:17.012]  And they told him, take your pants off or you'll be arrested.
[01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:20.295]  He said, he said, do you think I'm crazy?
[01:07:21.073 --> 01:07:24.034]  And they said, do it now or you'll be arrested.
[01:07:24.094 --> 01:07:25.095]  What do you have to hide?
[01:07:25.115 --> 01:07:26.495]  And they're being told to do this.
[01:07:26.515 --> 01:07:27.976]  It's all about humiliation.
[01:07:28.436 --> 01:07:31.617]  And now they're saying, oh, we've got to have troops on the streets.
[01:07:32.817 --> 01:07:35.939]  We've got to have these screeners in the buses, on the roads.
[01:07:36.279 --> 01:07:37.739]  The threat's going to expand.
[01:07:37.779 --> 01:07:40.040]  See, highway checkpoints where they're going to do this.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:45.242]  When I went up to Kansas City to do the expo up there a few months ago, it was very successful.
[01:07:46.903 --> 01:07:50.184]  On the way there, there's these federal toll roads slash state toll roads.
[01:07:51.011 --> 01:07:52.392]  And we slowed down to one.
[01:07:52.412 --> 01:07:53.253]  We had our video camera.
[01:07:53.273 --> 01:07:54.194]  We said, how's it going today?
[01:07:54.234 --> 01:07:55.815]  To a lady waving traffic in.
[01:07:55.835 --> 01:07:56.916]  And she said, turn that off!
[01:07:57.277 --> 01:07:58.097]  I'll have you arrested!
[01:07:58.137 --> 01:08:02.361]  And started yelling Homeland Security and literally running to the police.
[01:08:03.602 --> 01:08:04.743]  And they said, get out of here!
[01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:07.186]  And I said, go ahead.
[01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:09.007]  I don't want you to tell me to go.
[01:08:09.027 --> 01:08:10.228]  And then you call the police on me.
[01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:12.390]  And they got mad.
[01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:15.933]  And I heard them whisper something along the lines of, oh, he knows that we're trying to set us up.
[01:08:16.214 --> 01:08:17.675]  So I sat there and said, I'm waiting for the police.
[01:08:18.283 --> 01:08:20.165]  They said, if you don't go, we're going to have you arrested.
[01:08:20.465 --> 01:08:22.286]  So it's going to be like that for all of you folks.
[01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.208]  A bunch of articles here on that.
[01:08:25.809 --> 01:08:28.912]  I talked about how the American Bar Association wants to get rid of juries.
[01:08:29.532 --> 01:08:35.477]  They've now ruled, in their own little private group, that no attorney-client privilege in any case, not just corporate fraud.
[01:08:36.698 --> 01:08:44.759]  I talked about the BBC reporter who went to a land rights group and said that landowners deserve the same rights as homosexuals and minorities.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:45.960]  That's all he said.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.660]  Scotland Yard Diversity Unit had him arrested.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.661]  That article is on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:55.281]  It's got the audio interviews and it'll say BBC, click here to actually read the article.
[01:08:55.901 --> 01:09:00.002]  And Scotland Yard Diversity Unit had said that he said the word homosexual.
[01:09:00.142 --> 01:09:04.103]  That offends people so that he would now be arrested.
[01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:06.663]  Now, it's a medical word.
[01:09:06.703 --> 01:09:09.604]  He wasn't even bashing homosexuals, but it didn't matter.
[01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:14.666]  They said that word's not allowed now because the so-called homosexual groups find it offensive.
[01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:21.528]  So, see, now, just regular words aren't allowed, and they're getting rid of juries on the same thing.
[01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:23.168]  But here's one independent today.
[01:09:24.208 --> 01:09:24.668]  Racist.
[01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.649]  Racist.
[01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:26.349]  Oh, see, it's okay.
[01:09:26.589 --> 01:09:30.050]  Faces jail under first British court order to ban use of word.
[01:09:30.991 --> 01:09:32.052]  Banned use of word, folks.
[01:09:32.732 --> 01:09:37.614]  A man faces being sent to jail for the use of a specific term of racial abuse in public.
[01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:49.120]  Michael Galliflo, 31, is believed to be the first person in the UK, it's not true, they've done another headline in the London Telegraph was, hundreds raided nightly in hate crimes raids for speech.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.362]  It says he's believed to be the first person in the UK to be banned from using a particular word.
[01:09:57.279 --> 01:10:00.440]  That's just the abbreviation for Pakistanis.
[01:10:16.084 --> 01:10:17.684]  Well, you know what?
[01:10:17.825 --> 01:10:20.965]  If you don't agree with that, you know, call him a limey!
[01:10:35.118 --> 01:10:38.820]  But that's your God-given right, folks, because then it's going to be all speech.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:45.603]  They arrested a British minister and fired him, who criticized, who said that the EU was a Nazi state.
[01:10:45.623 --> 01:10:46.963]  They said, oh, that's insulting.
[01:10:49.744 --> 01:10:58.608]  Out in Utah last year, the Associated Press reported, a black umpire beat up a white woman with a local newspaper in front of the stands.
[01:10:59.068 --> 01:11:02.690]  He got mad, he got in an argument, she was taking photos, he started choking her, beating her up.
[01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:04.691]  You know, fights happen in sports.
[01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:06.072]  He was calling her racial names.
[01:11:06.532 --> 01:11:11.093]  Her husband jumped down out of the bleachers and yelled back at him a racial name.
[01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:14.654]  And both guys, you know, could grow up a little bit.
[01:11:15.134 --> 01:11:16.494]  Especially the guy assaulting her.
[01:11:16.534 --> 01:11:19.915]  But he didn't go to jail in his raves.
[01:11:19.935 --> 01:11:20.775]  This was in the paper.
[01:11:21.635 --> 01:11:23.136]  She got fired from the paper.
[01:11:23.396 --> 01:11:24.676]  The police arrested him.
[01:11:24.696 --> 01:11:26.276]  These are mainstream folks.
[01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:29.197]  Because they called him a racial name back.
[01:11:30.377 --> 01:11:31.878]  So don't think it won't happen here, folks.
[01:11:31.938 --> 01:11:32.558]  It already is.
[01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.592]  And, uh, it just goes on and on, folks.
[01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:41.335]  Man jailed over house extension.
[01:11:41.815 --> 01:11:42.676]  BBC.
[01:11:42.856 --> 01:11:49.180]  A Telford man has been jailed for three months for refusing to pull down an unauthorized extension he built to his house.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.361]  It's feudalism, folks.
[01:11:51.001 --> 01:12:02.529]  Sylvester Nezzo has been pursued through the courts by Telford and Work and Council for more than two years since building an addition to his home on Checkley Lane, St.
[01:12:02.589 --> 01:12:03.350]  George, without
[01:12:04.082 --> 01:12:05.522]  A planning permission.
[01:12:05.602 --> 01:12:07.303]  So we have the same feudalist system here.
[01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:09.563]  National Association of Counties and Cities go.
[01:12:09.904 --> 01:12:11.124]  They pass each other laws.
[01:12:11.144 --> 01:12:13.544]  They arrest people in Austin all the time for adding on.
[01:12:13.945 --> 01:12:18.226]  They put, you know, $20,000 in fines in a week, folks, and then take your house.
[01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:21.126]  It goes on.
[01:12:22.127 --> 01:12:26.028]  Had already been given three months suspended sentence for contempt of court.
[01:12:26.728 --> 01:12:31.689]  That stroke on Trent County Court in June, but was allowed this month to come to his census.
[01:12:32.651 --> 01:12:43.195]  He was told by the judge in Stamford Council Court, Crown Court on Tuesday, that as he failed to pull down the extension in the agreed time, he must now serve a suspended 12-week prison term.
[01:12:43.995 --> 01:12:44.935]  Bulldozer plan.
[01:12:46.276 --> 01:12:50.317]  And now they're going to use a bulldozer to bulldoze it.
[01:12:50.377 --> 01:12:52.318]  So, same, it's a British system, folks.
[01:12:52.938 --> 01:12:53.858]  It's a feudal system.
[01:12:54.218 --> 01:12:56.299]  The king says you can't build onto the surf.
[01:12:57.562 --> 01:12:59.804]  Holding, and if you don't, they come and burn it!
[01:13:00.144 --> 01:13:01.245]  That's what they did!
[01:13:01.305 --> 01:13:02.126]  It's feudalism!
[01:13:02.426 --> 01:13:08.711]  Genetic engineering, genetic breeding, eugenics, it's all feudalism, neo-feudalism.
[01:13:10.392 --> 01:13:12.574]  Oh man, I got just... Folks, I'm not kidding.
[01:13:12.614 --> 01:13:15.976]  Today, my wife printed, my webmaster printed like a hundred articles.
[01:13:16.216 --> 01:13:17.858]  They're all worse than this, okay?
[01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:20.119]  Who's up next here?
[01:13:20.179 --> 01:13:24.923]  I guess... Who's up first, Mark?
[01:13:26.024 --> 01:13:27.245]  Larry Louisiana, go ahead.
[01:13:27.705 --> 01:13:29.326]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing today?
[01:13:29.526 --> 01:13:29.907]  Pretty good.
[01:13:30.227 --> 01:13:30.627]  Good.
[01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:33.249]  I'm smelling another rat and another lead-in story.
[01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:33.990]  It's a headliner.
[01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:43.596]  It's the one about the missile smuggled out of Russia and sold up there in New York to a... Oh yeah, the Russians and the globalists are having all these states manage terrorist things every day.
[01:13:43.816 --> 01:13:46.798]  Well, they said how wonderful it was now that we have a world police connection.
[01:13:47.159 --> 01:13:48.079]  But here's the deal.
[01:13:48.499 --> 01:13:53.363]  A kid can be charged for a terrorist activity for drawing a picture of a gun in school.
[01:13:53.883 --> 01:13:59.727]  But the guys that sold this missile to the terrorists are not being charged with terrorism.
[01:14:00.067 --> 01:14:00.608]  Oh, I know.
[01:14:00.688 --> 01:14:06.371]  They, uh... They're being... Hey, all the time, kids are arrested for Tweety Bird keychains for drawing a picture of a gun.
[01:14:06.872 --> 01:14:07.932]  Well, here's the connection.
[01:14:08.633 --> 01:14:09.654]  It's about the money.
[01:14:09.734 --> 01:14:15.737]  Katie Couric got up there and asked the FBI expert, why aren't they being charged for... Oh, it's all about the money.
[01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:22.422]  So it's another lead-in story, and I believe the words are Arabic Intifada... How do you say that word?
[01:14:23.061 --> 01:14:23.642]  Interfata.
[01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:24.743]  Interfata.
[01:14:24.944 --> 01:14:30.311]  Now that sounds to most people like, oh good, they're going to catch those Arabs doing cash transactions.
[01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:32.273]  But people, it's for Americans.
[01:14:32.413 --> 01:14:38.121]  Yeah, the new Victory Act for secret arrest, secret execution, trading in $100 cash, terrorist defense instead of $3,000, it's about total
[01:14:42.025 --> 01:14:56.468]  Right, so the message to that story about the missile is that if we can just have complete control of the money, and then of course later on maybe... That's like the missing college kids that the FBI did say, and I've now got an article on it, that it should be illegal to buy gas or travel without being tracked.
[01:14:56.708 --> 01:15:10.691]  Exactly, that was the first lead-in I smelled, and this headliner is the second lead-in I'm smelling, because they're converting it from terrorism to just being about the money, so if we can just take care of control, completely control the money, and later on do away with it, we can control terrorism.
[01:15:10.771 --> 01:15:15.975]  Yeah, it should keep us all safe, but the border stays wide open and the big banks like BCCI fund all the tariffs.
[01:15:15.995 --> 01:15:16.595]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:17.516 --> 01:15:19.997]  Dennis in Missouri, then Ron and others.
[01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:20.758]  Dennis, go ahead.
[01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:21.859]  Are you there?
[01:15:22.139 --> 01:15:22.539]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.041]  I met you at the Expo.
[01:15:25.101 --> 01:15:28.843]  I was having the Reform Party booth selling the T-shirts.
[01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:29.464]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:29.504 --> 01:15:35.508]  What I'm calling about is on KCTV, they actually had a little blurb
[01:15:36.075 --> 01:15:50.287]  Well, they said that a Muslim FBI agent had caught a British citizen trying to sell him one of those shoulder-fired missiles, you know, rocket launchers.
[01:15:50.307 --> 01:15:55.431]  Well, yeah, you got MI6 not knowing they're going to their other agents trying to sell them weapons.
[01:15:55.531 --> 01:15:58.114]  I mean, this sounds really bizarre.
[01:15:58.134 --> 01:15:59.555]  I couldn't believe what I heard.
[01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:10.852]  They didn't say who the guy was, except that he was a British citizen, and he was trying to sell an FBI agent who was posing as a Muslim terrorist.
[01:16:11.193 --> 01:16:12.194]  Look, that's all they do.
[01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:16.458]  They just run around trying to find idiots that'll buy something from them.
[01:16:16.678 --> 01:16:17.279]  It's like...
[01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:20.698]  It's like Randy Weaver.
[01:16:20.718 --> 01:16:21.619]  You know, he didn't know any better.
[01:16:21.639 --> 01:16:23.039]  I'm not saying he's an idiot, but he was ignorant.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.640]  They just kept coming by for years.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.441]  They followed him from back east.
[01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:30.442]  And the same guy, please sell me a shotgun.
[01:16:30.522 --> 01:16:31.382]  Please saw it off.
[01:16:31.482 --> 01:16:31.842]  Please.
[01:16:32.462 --> 01:16:36.784]  And this kid, he said, alright, I'll saw the shotgun off.
[01:16:37.004 --> 01:16:37.704]  I'll do it.
[01:16:37.964 --> 01:16:39.264]  You know, tanks and helicopters.
[01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:40.745]  Stay there.
[01:16:44.006 --> 01:16:47.867]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and

[01:18:42.614 --> 01:18:44.835]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:18:45.275 --> 01:18:49.616]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:18:49.896 --> 01:18:55.698]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:18:55.938 --> 01:18:59.980]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.922]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:08.642]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:19:10.743 --> 01:19:14.645]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:19:14.685 --> 01:19:17.065]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:19:17.406 --> 01:19:19.707]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:19:20.107 --> 01:19:23.708]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:19:24.188 --> 01:19:30.391]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:31.811]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:19:31.831 --> 01:19:32.491]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:32.511 --> 01:19:32.711]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.494 --> 01:19:47.377]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[01:19:47.797 --> 01:19:48.497]  Is this true?
[01:19:49.057 --> 01:19:53.979]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying secret societies and subversive movements.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:20:00.122]  He lived in Africa for three years, and when he returned home, he studied the writings of the men who shaped the modern world.
[01:20:00.522 --> 01:20:02.283]  His book, Brotherhood of Darkness,
[01:20:02.503 --> 01:20:06.226]  ...identifies the people who control the world and the organizations they created.
[01:20:06.467 --> 01:20:14.053]  Dr. Monteith exposes the movement behind Rhodes Scholarship, the origin of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the myths surrounding communism.
[01:20:14.394 --> 01:20:17.016]  He discusses the goal of all covert organizations.
[01:20:17.276 --> 01:20:22.080]  So if you read Brotherhood of Darkness, you will learn a secret that has been passed down through the centuries.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:28.206]  When you learn this secret, you will understand what the future holds, and what you must do to help preserve our nation.
[01:20:28.886 --> 01:20:30.087]  Call and order your copy.
[01:20:30.107 --> 01:20:30.147]  877-300-7645.
[01:20:30.167 --> 01:20:30.247]  Only $12.95.
[01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:30.888]  That's 877-300-7695.
[01:20:50.188 --> 01:20:52.910]  Folks, I've got news that will totally blow you away.
[01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:54.551]  I mean, it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:20:54.711 --> 01:20:58.935]  And stories about how a bunch of colleges are going to offer Homeland Security degrees.
[01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:01.818]  They're going to institutionalize this.
[01:21:01.838 --> 01:21:04.120]  They're going to make this the new profession.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:06.101]  Most of the government's going to be made up of it.
[01:21:06.482 --> 01:21:08.703]  Paddle tail, secret police, surveillance.
[01:21:10.045 --> 01:21:13.808]  And of course, there'll be terrorism that will be needed to keep all this going.
[01:21:14.775 --> 01:21:19.339]  I can say is that, you know, the media acts like the Brits are our allies and all that crap, and then they find that
[01:21:35.248 --> 01:21:43.255]  A British citizen going and trying to sell a rocket-fired missile launcher to a supposedly fake Muslim terrorist.
[01:21:43.335 --> 01:21:44.817]  I mean, this is really bizarre.
[01:21:44.897 --> 01:21:56.968]  Sir, in Masters of Terror, in Police State 3, in the book, Ordered Out of Chaos, we detail, admitted, documented, mainstream, almost all terror in the British Isles, from Ireland to Scotland, to London,
[01:21:57.819 --> 01:21:58.439]  I believe you.
[01:21:58.479 --> 01:22:00.140]  It was nice seeing you up there anyway at Kansas City.
[01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:28.223]  I'll let you go.
[01:22:28.684 --> 01:22:29.304]  Thank you, sir.
[01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:29.964]  All right.
[01:22:30.144 --> 01:22:30.504]  You bet.
[01:22:30.584 --> 01:22:32.105]  Yeah, they're institutionalizing this.
[01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:33.726]  That's why they said the terror is never going to end.
[01:22:34.146 --> 01:22:36.167]  Well, yeah, it's their excuse to get total control.
[01:22:36.407 --> 01:22:37.607]  What power mongers want?
[01:22:37.807 --> 01:22:38.808]  What history shows?
[01:22:38.948 --> 01:22:39.488]  Wake up!
[01:22:40.428 --> 01:22:41.769]  Resistance is not futile, folks.
[01:22:41.789 --> 01:22:44.770]  We've just got to keep saying no to this and exposing who the terrorists are.
[01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:47.631]  Ron in New York, and then Becky, Jim, Lou, and others.
[01:22:47.972 --> 01:22:48.792]  Now, go ahead, Ron.
[01:22:48.812 --> 01:22:49.472]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:50.933]  I pulled down a few things.
[01:22:50.973 --> 01:22:54.935]  I went through the daily newspapers here in New York today, and I got some things for you.
[01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:55.875]  But I'm going to start out
[01:22:56.491 --> 01:22:59.793]  With the new ABA standards for lawyer-client confidentiality.
[01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:05.757]  Um, all the newspapers here are playing it up that it only pertains to large corporate Enron-type fraud.
[01:23:05.817 --> 01:23:06.637]  Well... Total lie!
[01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:07.618]  Okay, it is a lie.
[01:23:08.018 --> 01:23:13.041]  I called the ABA yesterday, I called the National Headquarters, and they read to me the regulation verbatim.
[01:23:13.382 --> 01:23:22.067]  And most of the regulation does ramble on about corporate fraud, but just about at the end, there's a, uh, a little clause in there, and it's like, slash any crime.
[01:23:22.952 --> 01:23:29.073]  So, they threw that little catch-all phrase in there, so, you know, they ramble on, corporate fraud, corporate fraud, and it applies to me.
[01:23:29.093 --> 01:23:30.974]  It's the same thing about the Homeland Security and Patriot Act.
[01:23:30.994 --> 01:23:44.957]  We love everyone, you have total rights, we just love Mickey Mouse, and we're just sweet and lovable little furballs of love, and then we can secretly arrest you and kill you and bring in foreign troops and put you in prison for life for any reason, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:44.977 --> 01:23:47.118]  The Homeland Security Act is like that too, right?
[01:23:47.158 --> 01:23:51.979]  It rambles on about foreign terrorism, and then you'll find usually at the end a few words and a paragraph or a sentence
[01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.542]  Terrorism is in the action that endangers human life.
[01:23:55.582 --> 01:23:56.322]  We'll put you in prison.
[01:23:56.342 --> 01:23:57.362]  We'll secretly execute you.
[01:23:57.382 --> 01:23:58.002]  Ha ha ha!
[01:23:58.362 --> 01:24:05.964]  So, my advice is, anybody that goes to an attorney at this point, you better make damn sure, and have it in black and white, that there truly is confidentiality.
[01:24:05.984 --> 01:24:06.724]  Okay, let me stop you.
[01:24:06.864 --> 01:24:09.524]  We've got somebody saying the C word and now the D word.
[01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.265]  We've got a lot of kids listening.
[01:24:11.585 --> 01:24:12.185]  Remember that.
[01:24:12.205 --> 01:24:14.905]  You're addressing tens of thousands of homeschoolers.
[01:24:14.945 --> 01:24:17.606]  This show is required listening for thousands of homes.
[01:24:17.726 --> 01:24:18.926]  Please watch your language.
[01:24:19.522 --> 01:24:20.603]  But now we move on.
[01:24:20.843 --> 01:24:22.403]  Now we have some Nazis are in, man.
[01:24:22.483 --> 01:24:23.504]  Nazis are in fashion.
[01:24:23.664 --> 01:24:25.985]  The Daily News, page 8 off the AP Wire.
[01:24:26.825 --> 01:24:32.348]  A chic upscale clothing store in Hong Kong was selling Nazi fashions.
[01:24:32.948 --> 01:24:39.031]  They had swastikas decorating the stores, and they were playing loops of old Nazi propaganda films.
[01:24:39.891 --> 01:24:46.214]  It had to come to an end, but the manager of one of the stores in Hong Kong said that the people in Hong Kong had liked it.
[01:24:47.294 --> 01:24:48.015]  Oh, look!
[01:24:48.155 --> 01:24:48.395]  I mean,
[01:24:49.264 --> 01:24:50.925]  Uh, this is what Arnold's all about.
[01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:53.586]  He says he admires Hitler, that's his role model.
[01:24:53.847 --> 01:24:55.828]  He hangs out with Kurt Voltine, defends him.
[01:24:56.428 --> 01:24:56.968]  That's cool now.
[01:24:56.988 --> 01:24:57.689]  He's a war criminal.
[01:24:57.969 --> 01:25:00.390]  And then the Simon Wiesenthal Center says they're great.
[01:25:01.051 --> 01:25:02.111]  Says that Arnold's great.
[01:25:02.471 --> 01:25:03.052]  Newsday!
[01:25:03.352 --> 01:25:05.753]  Today's Newsday, New York Newsday, obituary.
[01:25:06.454 --> 01:25:09.635]  Lady Diane Mosley, wife of Sir Oswald Mosley.
[01:25:09.655 --> 01:25:12.437]  He was a fascist leader in Britain during World War II.
[01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:15.787]  Sister of the Duchess of Devonshire passes away 93.
[01:25:16.488 --> 01:25:17.648]  She was loyal to the end.
[01:25:17.989 --> 01:25:18.549]  Do you get it?
[01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:22.231]  Lady, Duchess, Sir, British aristocracy, Nazis.
[01:25:22.271 --> 01:25:22.871]  Does it connect?
[01:25:23.312 --> 01:25:25.393]  Well, that's what the British aristocracy is.
[01:25:26.213 --> 01:25:27.854]  Well, there it is in black and white.
[01:25:27.874 --> 01:25:29.415]  They are admitted Merovingians.
[01:25:29.475 --> 01:25:31.196]  They're Alsatians.
[01:25:31.992 --> 01:25:34.454]  Now, also, you say there's lots of kids listening.
[01:25:34.474 --> 01:25:35.955]  Well, we got a new toy for them.
[01:25:36.255 --> 01:25:38.497]  New York Post, page 3, Vincent Morris.
[01:25:39.077 --> 01:25:40.778]  A Bush-style, G.W.
[01:25:40.818 --> 01:25:41.819]  Bush-style G.I.
[01:25:41.879 --> 01:25:43.420]  Joe doll is now available.
[01:25:44.521 --> 01:25:45.121]  George W. Bush.
[01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:47.203]  Aircraft Aviator Commander.
[01:25:47.543 --> 01:25:49.864]  Right, dressed in his flight suit.
[01:25:50.325 --> 01:25:54.427]  So they could buy that, parents could buy that for all the kids to play with.
[01:25:54.968 --> 01:25:56.769]  And I guess we could deify him.
[01:25:56.809 --> 01:25:58.230]  You're right, we should have feudalism.
[01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:59.331]  It should be Lord Bush.
[01:26:00.292 --> 01:26:07.017]  Let's say instead of the Senator of New York, we'll have the Duchess Hillary Clinton of New York, and it goes on and on.
[01:26:07.457 --> 01:26:17.824]  Also, if you could follow up with a story about that guy in the mall upstate New York who was arrested for wearing the Peace T-shirt, and by the way, you remember that prodigy child who was a homeschooler here in New York?
[01:26:18.384 --> 01:26:19.985]  You had him on the show I told you about?
[01:26:20.005 --> 01:26:20.925]  Yeah, they're trying to take her.
[01:26:21.226 --> 01:26:27.770]  Yeah, went to court, they ruled that no matter how you look at it, she hasn't got enough credit, has to go through high school.
[01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:29.331]  Stay there, I want to hear about that.
[01:26:30.294 --> 01:26:32.155]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:34.317]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.797 --> 01:26:36.418]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.339 --> 01:26:40.021]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.268 --> 01:26:50.776]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive, yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:26:51.057 --> 01:26:56.182]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because... 996-4327.
[01:26:56.243 --> 01:27:00.728]  Become a part of the Genesis Team by calling your local station or call the National Line at 877-996-4327.
[01:27:11.933 --> 01:27:15.354]  Warrior calls and a ton of news.
[01:27:15.414 --> 01:27:18.075]  Again, Warrior calls and a ton of news coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:27:20.135 --> 01:27:23.076]  Real quick, I wanted to let Ron in New York finish up.
[01:27:23.116 --> 01:27:25.056]  Yeah, it was in the New York Post and other papers.
[01:27:26.056 --> 01:27:28.677]  15 years old, graduating from an accredited college with a 3.84.
[01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:33.218]  It's about a 97 average.
[01:27:34.558 --> 01:27:39.139]  And when they saw her in the paper, the CPS has been trying to take her from the family.
[01:27:39.159 --> 01:27:39.920]  That was in the news.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080]  We had the family on.
[01:27:42.432 --> 01:27:45.275]  And now Ron is giving us an update on what happened.
[01:27:45.975 --> 01:27:48.057]  So what does the paper say ended up happening with her?
[01:27:48.077 --> 01:27:52.562]  The story was reported on the ABC Radio News Network two days ago.
[01:27:53.102 --> 01:28:02.451]  Even after they take in consideration everything she achieved, which we know is massive, they determined that she only was able to obtain 27 credits, which fell short
[01:28:02.975 --> 01:28:07.017]  Of what is necessary for a high school diploma, and now she's got to go through it.
[01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:11.340]  Now understand, they blocked the college giving her her honors degree.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.481]  That's correct, yeah.
[01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.682]  And so they're saying she's got to go back to a school.
[01:28:15.702 --> 01:28:16.703]  Uh huh.
[01:28:16.843 --> 01:28:19.805]  And folks, you've always been able to get into college.
[01:28:19.825 --> 01:28:22.206]  There's kids graduating all the time at 15 from college.
[01:28:23.187 --> 01:28:24.328]  But no, they don't want that.
[01:28:24.368 --> 01:28:25.948]  They want you to be a mindless idiot.
[01:28:25.968 --> 01:28:26.509]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:27.782 --> 01:28:28.403]  Yeah, Ron?
[01:28:28.643 --> 01:28:29.523]  Listen, one last thing.
[01:28:29.564 --> 01:28:35.649]  When I did call the ABA and spoke with a person there about those confidentiality rules, she said the following, and I have to say this.
[01:28:36.049 --> 01:28:45.737]  She said, well, the rule is based on the discretion of the attorney, and I think and say, yeah, and he'll exercise that discretion in proportion to the government reward offered for information.
[01:28:45.857 --> 01:28:46.577]  Well, that's it.
[01:28:46.858 --> 01:28:48.839]  Your lawyer now is a spy for the government.
[01:28:48.899 --> 01:28:49.840]  It's already happened.
[01:28:50.341 --> 01:28:53.563]  And the same American Bar Association has said they want to get rid of juries.
[01:28:53.944 --> 01:28:55.445]  They want to get rid of them, folks!
[01:28:56.758 --> 01:29:02.141]  Well, I don't know, maybe we should just let Hannity and Limbaugh do our thinking for us.
[01:29:02.922 --> 01:29:12.948]  Well, they say Arnold's good, abortion, gun control, homosexual adoption of kids, that's the new conservatism, and we're liberals.
[01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:21.315]  You know, Limbaugh says, well, Arnold, you know, Ted, you know, the Kennedys, Joseph Kennedy was in with the Nazis, and you don't hear the liberals saying that.
[01:29:21.375 --> 01:29:23.856]  Yeah, you don't hear them talking about Margaret Sanger either.
[01:29:24.097 --> 01:29:27.379]  Just because they're in with the Nazis doesn't mean it's okay if the Republicans are.
[01:29:27.399 --> 01:29:29.320]  I just love this system.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.901]  Two wrongs don't make a right.
[01:29:31.161 --> 01:29:32.322]  Oh, it's out of control.
[01:29:32.342 --> 01:29:33.763]  People got to wake up.
[01:29:33.903 --> 01:29:35.344]  They got to wake up, Alex.
[01:29:36.044 --> 01:29:37.325]  We're on Drupal Gun, right?
[01:29:37.822 --> 01:29:38.202]  I'm sorry?
[01:29:38.602 --> 01:29:39.663]  You're pro-Second Amendment?
[01:29:39.923 --> 01:29:41.383]  Yes, I am.
[01:29:41.403 --> 01:29:41.383]  110%?
[01:29:41.903 --> 01:29:43.184]  Yes, I'm pro-Constitution.
[01:29:43.224 --> 01:29:43.744]  That's correct.
[01:29:43.824 --> 01:29:45.204]  Then you're a liberal communist.
[01:29:45.304 --> 01:29:46.064]  Yeah, now, yeah.
[01:29:46.164 --> 01:29:47.525]  Anti-gun, anti-America.
[01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:49.325]  You're a very conservative good person.
[01:29:49.665 --> 01:29:50.245]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:50.946]  That's correct.
[01:29:50.986 --> 01:29:51.886]  That's the way they think.
[01:29:51.926 --> 01:29:52.446]  Thank you, Ron.
[01:29:52.466 --> 01:29:53.046]  Gotta let you go.
[01:29:53.886 --> 01:29:54.727]  Yeah, that's the system.
[01:29:54.927 --> 01:29:59.348]  We're gonna go to Becky, Jim, Lou, Tim, and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:29:59.408 --> 01:30:00.648]  And I think we've got a bunch of other news.
[01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:04.149]  But for the next five, we are joined by my good buddy, Jim Shepard.
[01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:06.270]  We're talking about how to protect yourselves, folks.
[01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:09.911]  The Globalists have said the water supplies are a target, will be hit.
[01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:10.951]  I hope that's not the case.
[01:30:11.411 --> 01:30:14.552]  But we know they've already been hit by deadly fluoride, admitted to be deadly.
[01:30:14.792 --> 01:30:17.332]  The big Canadian scientist who was for it just said it's bad.
[01:30:18.173 --> 01:30:20.893]  We know they're putting herbicide, pesticide, we know it's all in there.
[01:30:20.993 --> 01:30:22.874]  Prozac gets in there, Ritalin gets in there.
[01:30:23.754 --> 01:30:27.074]  Dead bacteria, the chlorine may kill the bacteria, but you're still drinking them.
[01:30:27.755 --> 01:30:29.875]  The big, murky line of filters are the best out there.
[01:30:29.915 --> 01:30:31.615]  I bought them before Jim was a sponsor.
[01:30:32.036 --> 01:30:33.756]  This show's about taking control of your life.
[01:30:34.426 --> 01:30:40.508]  And they've got new, even more powerful filters, made in America, at great prices, and we've got some specials for you.
[01:30:40.528 --> 01:30:42.889]  So, Jim Shepard, tell them all about it.
[01:30:43.749 --> 01:30:44.129]  Okay.
[01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:53.112]  Well, most people are pretty familiar with the power of the black Berkey filter elements, the ones that are in the Berkey light systems.
[01:30:53.472 --> 01:31:04.115]  The fluoride is a big issue, and as we discussed the other day, the head guy in Canada, they got fluoride into the water of the Canadian system.
[01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:08.791]  ...has done a complete about-face, and I'm quoting him right here.
[01:31:09.211 --> 01:31:22.914]  Tragically, he continued, "...that means that we're not just dumping toxic fluoride into our drinking water, we're also exposing innocent, unsuspecting people to deadly elements, lead, arsenic, and radium, all of them carcinogenic.
[01:31:23.114 --> 01:31:28.375]  Because of the cumulative properties of toxins, the detrimental effects on human health are catastrophic."
[01:31:28.455 --> 01:31:33.896]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, they're not using calcium fluoride that small amounts of it are good for you.
[01:31:34.682 --> 01:31:41.686]  They're using the sodium fluoride that is the byproduct of aluminum and fertilizer manufacturing.
[01:31:42.326 --> 01:31:46.728]  Now that's a fact, folks, and we have hundreds of university studies.
[01:31:47.409 --> 01:31:49.170]  Most filters will not cut the fluoride out.
[01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:50.630]  Jim has got one that will.
[01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:51.611]  Go ahead and tell them about it, Jim.
[01:31:52.031 --> 01:31:53.552]  Okay, well we're going to run a special.
[01:31:53.792 --> 01:31:58.274]  This is the PF2, and this is for folks who have black, burky filter elements.
[01:31:59.595 --> 01:32:02.917]  They come with the burky light system.
[01:32:03.892 --> 01:32:07.274]  And if you've got the ceramic filters, then we've got a different one for that.
[01:32:07.334 --> 01:32:09.576]  But this is for the black Berkey filter elements.
[01:32:10.276 --> 01:32:19.922]  And they're designed to reduce the fluoride, arsenic, and any residual heavy metal ions that are in the water.
[01:32:20.763 --> 01:32:23.364]  And we have just improved them.
[01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:26.767]  The new ones run about 20% faster than the old ones.
[01:32:26.787 --> 01:32:30.409]  So we're going to offer a special on the Generation 1 PF2 filters.
[01:32:32.702 --> 01:32:49.355]  If you don't have a Berkey system and you order a Berkey light with the lights for $2.59 or the Berkey light without the lights for $1.99, add $10 to the order and we'll send you a set of $50 PF2 fluoride filters.
[01:32:49.415 --> 01:32:50.456]  Now for those who don't know,
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.921]  This filter does 20 gallons a day.
[01:32:54.501 --> 01:32:56.703]  The new one you did does 30 gallons a day.
[01:32:56.743 --> 01:32:57.643]  So it's a great deal.
[01:32:58.183 --> 01:33:03.306]  Most of you aren't going to use more than 20 gallons a day, folks, for drinking water and for cooking water.
[01:33:03.967 --> 01:33:05.027]  That's a good point.
[01:33:05.167 --> 01:33:11.691]  And I think the point is that they're going to remove the same amount of fluoride from the water.
[01:33:12.011 --> 01:33:13.392]  They're not any less efficient.
[01:33:13.532 --> 01:33:15.093]  It's just that they flow slower.
[01:33:15.982 --> 01:33:17.983]  And then the new generation.
[01:33:18.383 --> 01:33:22.404]  And so there's plenty of water to go to for a family.
[01:33:23.565 --> 01:33:35.009]  And now, if you want two sets, then add $20 to your Berkey order, and we'll send you out $100 worth of PF2 filters.
[01:33:35.869 --> 01:33:43.572]  If you already have a Berkey light, and you want to get the PF2 filters, then we'll sell those to you for half price.
[01:33:44.592 --> 01:33:54.300]  And so instead of $50, it would be $25 a set, and this is a great way to stock up, you know, for future years on the PF2s.
[01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:59.945]  And so I think we've got probably about 60 or 70 sets left, and when those are gone, they're gone.
[01:34:00.586 --> 01:34:02.507]  All right, and it's all a great value.
[01:34:02.547 --> 01:34:03.948]  Take control of your life, folks.
[01:34:04.529 --> 01:34:09.433]  Call right now, and if the folks answering the phones are busy, leave your name and number.
[01:34:09.473 --> 01:34:10.514]  They'll call you right back.
[01:34:11.872 --> 01:34:13.073]  Or just call back.
[01:34:13.093 --> 01:34:15.775]  The toll-free number to call is 1-888-803-4438.
[01:34:17.456 --> 01:34:23.199]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.161]  You also have shower filters.
[01:34:28.202 --> 01:34:31.203]  You have potassium iodate in case there's a nuclear exposure.
[01:34:31.243 --> 01:34:33.825]  You take it, it blocks the thyroid with the good iodine.
[01:34:35.413 --> 01:34:43.037]  You've got the sports bottle filters that are portable, so you can feed that tap water and work through it.
[01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:45.298]  It cuts out everything but the fluoride, unfortunately.
[01:34:45.318 --> 01:34:46.539]  It reduces that somewhat.
[01:34:46.859 --> 01:34:48.740]  Fluoride is just designed to go through everything.
[01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:50.781]  How much are the sports bottles?
[01:34:51.982 --> 01:34:54.103]  Well, the sports bottles are $39.
[01:34:55.844 --> 01:35:01.207]  If you order a Berkey Light, we'll go ahead and do a special on that and add an extra
[01:35:04.114 --> 01:35:04.474]  I think so.
[01:35:34.463 --> 01:35:40.925]  And they don't want to learn anything after that, and basically what they learned 20 years ago is what they believe, and that's not going to change.
[01:35:41.545 --> 01:35:58.191]  And then you have others who, I think there's a lot of them who, you know, they hear people talking about the toxic properties of fluoride, and so they go to do the research to prove them wrong, and in the research they start discovering that, wait a minute, maybe they're not wrong, maybe I'm the one that's wrong.
[01:35:59.031 --> 01:36:06.353]  And I've known quite a few... Well, that's like the head guy of the Army who they sent to whitewash the depleted uranium at 91.
[01:36:06.714 --> 01:36:09.214]  He quit and said, this is killing the troops, this is deadly.
[01:36:09.594 --> 01:36:13.376]  They got radiation sickness and now he's out saying it's happened again.
[01:36:14.096 --> 01:36:15.997]  Look, the globalists have got a problem, folks.
[01:36:16.317 --> 01:36:19.078]  If you'll just investigate what we're saying, you'll find out it's true.
[01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:22.271]  Now is the time, folks.
[01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:22.791]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:27.055]  Take advantage of this special.
[01:36:27.675 --> 01:36:38.584]  Jim, the American Bar Association, in their document, and I've looked at it, not just for corporate fraud, it's for all so-called crime, now your lawyer is a tattletale of the government.
[01:36:40.245 --> 01:36:41.226]  Is that not incredible?
[01:36:41.486 --> 01:36:42.687]  That is incredible.
[01:36:42.747 --> 01:36:44.648]  What happened to attorney-client privilege?
[01:36:45.129 --> 01:36:48.051]  They just voted it down yesterday in San Francisco.
[01:36:49.406 --> 01:36:52.529]  Now, is this for the state of California or is this nationwide?
[01:36:52.649 --> 01:36:57.993]  No, the National Bar met in San Francisco and got the Associated Press article here.
[01:36:58.013 --> 01:36:58.634]  Let me dig it out.
[01:36:59.174 --> 01:37:05.740]  ABA erases rule on informing lawyers can now report suspected fraud by clients.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.861]  And that is the Washington Post.
[01:37:07.881 --> 01:37:09.123]  I have another AP article here.
[01:37:09.443 --> 01:37:12.465]  They voted 218 to 201 with the board.
[01:37:13.366 --> 01:37:14.687]  Boy, that's a real slick deal.
[01:37:14.707 --> 01:37:15.328]  You go to
[01:37:16.004 --> 01:37:22.465]  Somebody goes to an attorney, he charges them $280 an hour, or whatever they charge now, so that he can inform on them.
[01:37:22.705 --> 01:37:23.405]  That's a deal.
[01:37:23.845 --> 01:37:26.766]  Well, they've already been doing it and getting in trouble, so this is to protect them.
[01:37:27.346 --> 01:37:30.247]  Oh, they also are calling to abolish the jury system.
[01:37:33.107 --> 01:37:34.087]  Boy, that's real sweet.
[01:37:35.287 --> 01:37:43.349]  I tell you, Alex, you know, some of this stuff that's coming down the pike, if somebody would have said this was going to happen 15 years ago, everybody would have said, you're a stark, raving mad.
[01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:53.724]  I don't know if you ever read David Wilkerson's book.
[01:37:54.044 --> 01:37:54.684]  I read it back in 1976.
[01:37:54.784 --> 01:37:56.824]  I think it was called The Vision.
[01:37:59.345 --> 01:38:05.866]  He had a vision and he laid it out of what was going to take place in America.
[01:38:05.886 --> 01:38:07.806]  I guess I read that in 1976.
[01:38:11.613 --> 01:38:14.835]  In 76, I read that, and it just seemed like science fiction.
[01:38:15.255 --> 01:38:15.975]  I haven't heard of that.
[01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:17.656]  What did he say was going to happen?
[01:38:18.116 --> 01:38:21.178]  I picked that book up about a year ago and re-read it, and I couldn't believe it.
[01:38:21.298 --> 01:38:23.239]  It was just all like ancient history.
[01:38:23.839 --> 01:38:31.463]  Oh, he said that, uh... Well, some of the things that he said is that they would start ordaining, uh, gay, uh, you know, ministers.
[01:38:31.943 --> 01:38:34.124]  And, you know, back in 76, it was like, what?
[01:38:34.204 --> 01:38:35.765]  This had never happened in America.
[01:38:36.826 --> 01:38:37.066]  And, uh,
[01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:39.627]  Oh, geez.
[01:38:39.727 --> 01:39:04.418]  Just, you know, all the stuff that's on the front headlines is stuff that he wrote in that book back in 1976, and it's been about a year since I've read it, but what I can tell you is that the stuff that he wrote in there that just, well, one of the things that he said back then is that you would, that people would be getting pornography on their home TVs, and it was like, no, this could never happen in America way back then.
[01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:05.258]  Today,
[01:39:05.788 --> 01:39:08.050]  Through cable TV, that's just everyday stuff.
[01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:15.336]  Hey, like I said, I've walked into hotel rooms, turned it on, and somebody was in there before me, you know, six hours before, bought the big package.
[01:39:16.036 --> 01:39:17.838]  And it's just Triple X right there.
[01:39:18.959 --> 01:39:22.762]  And then I was in Kansas City, it wasn't just the heterosexual stuff, folks.
[01:39:22.982 --> 01:39:25.704]  There in the menu, it wasn't on, I just looked at the menu.
[01:39:26.545 --> 01:39:34.472]  And now Channel 4 in England is going to air... I hate to even mention this, folks, this is BBC.
[01:39:35.693 --> 01:39:38.035]  Ten-year-old kids having sex in a house.
[01:39:38.916 --> 01:39:41.518]  I mean, like Big Brother, with cameras.
[01:39:41.979 --> 01:39:42.719]  You're kidding.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:43.200]  Nope.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.522]  This is going to be in the UK or in America?
[01:39:45.642 --> 01:39:46.002]  UK.
[01:39:46.062 --> 01:39:49.305]  And the same channel last year had the guy eat the baby.
[01:39:49.325 --> 01:39:50.046]  A real baby.
[01:39:50.146 --> 01:39:52.228]  Saw it up, eat it, marinate it.
[01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:58.233]  I tell you, I don't know where this is all going to end, but I tell you what, it's like
[01:40:00.428 --> 01:40:02.710]  At times I feel like I'm going into a science fiction movie.
[01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:05.552]  You know, you used to see these old science fiction movies about Atlantis.
[01:40:06.233 --> 01:40:12.238]  You know, and they were mixing, you know, cows with humans, and guys had horns, and all this stuff.
[01:40:12.278 --> 01:40:14.380]  And it's just like this strange, bizarre society.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.143]  And it just seems like, dang, you know, we're just going down that road.
[01:40:18.183 --> 01:40:19.023]  I mean... Oh, yeah.
[01:40:19.084 --> 01:40:24.368]  In Taiwan, on the streets, they're selling a cross between a fish and a jellyfish.
[01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:36.035]  And it's like Blade Runner where, you know, the Blade Runner's walking along, the cop is, and he's, you know, showing people the genetics of this snake, and they go, ah, superior craftsmanship, you know, excellent quality.
[01:40:36.115 --> 01:40:38.876]  Now the very thing's going on with this.
[01:40:38.936 --> 01:40:45.379]  I watched a video clip on the news side about it that showed these fish that glow in the dark are part jellyfish, and you buy them.
[01:40:45.419 --> 01:40:50.442]  I mean, it's just genetic-engineered chimeras just in the corner square.
[01:40:51.428 --> 01:40:52.849]  Yeah, I was listening.
[01:40:52.889 --> 01:40:56.272]  I think it was a public PBS station.
[01:40:56.492 --> 01:41:03.397]  But anyway, they were talking about that they have a cross between a monkey and a jellyfish and the hair glows green on the thing.
[01:41:03.417 --> 01:41:04.578]  Oh, I saw that.
[01:41:04.598 --> 01:41:07.119]  The glowing green monkeys, too.
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:07.880]  Pardon me?
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.741]  Yeah, the glowing green monkeys.
[01:41:09.801 --> 01:41:10.262]  I saw that.
[01:41:10.562 --> 01:41:10.782]  Yep.
[01:41:11.503 --> 01:41:12.663]  Yeah, their blood glows, too.
[01:41:12.723 --> 01:41:15.986]  Yeah, the jellyfish they found can be put into a lot of different animals.
[01:41:18.728 --> 01:41:19.348]  It's incredible.
[01:41:22.364 --> 01:41:28.946]  Look, last week they announced that DARPA is going to put a hundred blimps in the sky with ground penetrating radar over every U.S.
[01:41:28.986 --> 01:41:32.186]  city that will just look through our walls and watch us for our safety.
[01:41:33.466 --> 01:41:36.807]  The same group that announced they're going to bet on dead soldiers and what city will get nuked.
[01:41:38.087 --> 01:41:49.390]  Then they announced that, oh yeah, DARPA's going to put brain scanners in on the streets, already done it in five airports, that scan your brain and see if you're hiding aggression, then the police will question you.
[01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:50.730]  This is Boston Globe, folks.
[01:41:51.914 --> 01:41:52.294]  Dang!
[01:41:52.835 --> 01:41:59.038]  Yeah, I mean, it's like we fell into an alternate dimension, and the general public's just being conditioned, going, yeah, yeah, it's normal.
[01:41:59.658 --> 01:42:15.227]  Well, it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger saying in 76 on Pumping Iron that his idol is Adolf Hitler, and he vacations with Kurt Voltheim last year, the Nazi, and he does all this, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center loves him, but is attacking Mel Gibson.
[01:42:17.152 --> 01:42:18.492]  Are they going after Mel Gibson?
[01:42:18.893 --> 01:42:20.434]  They're calling for a ban on it.
[01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:22.315]  They're calling to not have it air in the U.S.
[01:42:22.355 --> 01:42:23.255]  or to be re-edited.
[01:42:23.736 --> 01:42:26.317]  And it's word-for-word a translation from the King James.
[01:42:26.578 --> 01:42:27.618]  It's just the story.
[01:42:29.319 --> 01:42:34.122]  Well, King James, or excuse me, you know, Mel Gibson, I think that that guy's got some kahunas.
[01:42:35.043 --> 01:42:44.209]  And I think that he's gotten, as I understand, there's a lot of Hollywood types that don't like him because he does try to make statements, you know, in some of his movies.
[01:42:44.702 --> 01:42:48.145]  And in many of them he's had to finance them himself because they don't want to touch it.
[01:42:48.345 --> 01:42:48.805]  Yeah, he did.
[01:42:48.845 --> 01:42:50.506]  He put $25 million into the passion.
[01:42:50.767 --> 01:42:51.867]  Hey Jim, thanks for coming on.
[01:42:51.947 --> 01:42:53.589]  Hey, always a pleasure talking with you, Alex.
[01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:55.130]  Good to hear from you, my compadre.
[01:42:56.251 --> 01:42:58.893]  Okay, Mark keeps giving me the callers and I keep losing them.
[01:43:00.814 --> 01:43:01.194]  Who's in Ohio?
[01:43:01.254 --> 01:43:01.855]  Oh, I found them.
[01:43:02.615 --> 01:43:03.876]  Yeah, Becky in Ohio.
[01:43:03.916 --> 01:43:04.637]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:04.677 --> 01:43:05.097]  Go ahead.
[01:43:05.117 --> 01:43:07.639]  Yeah, I was trying to find out.
[01:43:08.154 --> 01:43:11.095]  Where do you find out about this medical draft thing that Joyce referred to?
[01:43:11.335 --> 01:43:13.637]  That was the Houston Chronicle about a month and a half ago.
[01:43:13.697 --> 01:43:19.859]  It's already lined up and ready to draft medical workers, engineers, to serve in forced inoculation.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.901]  And they're going to draft all the high school kids to Seeker Police.
[01:43:23.941 --> 01:43:24.802]  That's Secure Corps.
[01:43:25.222 --> 01:43:26.783]  I tried to... It's called Secure Corps?
[01:43:27.123 --> 01:43:29.544]  I was going to try to do a search on her line and it's forbidden.
[01:43:30.254 --> 01:43:33.356]  I went to her website to try to find it and it says forbidden.
[01:43:33.656 --> 01:43:34.996]  You don't have permission to access.
[01:43:35.217 --> 01:43:35.977]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:36.357 --> 01:43:38.078]  Well, sometimes it says that when a link's dead.
[01:43:38.138 --> 01:43:39.459]  I read it on air.
[01:43:39.939 --> 01:43:40.859]  Houston Chronicle.
[01:43:41.339 --> 01:43:49.863]  Type in Pentagon Proposes Medical Draft or Pentagon Proposes Draft of Professionals.
[01:43:50.484 --> 01:43:51.064]  At your site?
[01:43:51.684 --> 01:43:54.326]  Well, just in like Google or Yahoo or whatever.
[01:43:54.346 --> 01:43:54.506]  Okay.
[01:43:55.126 --> 01:43:56.507]  And then a couple other points.
[01:43:58.410 --> 01:44:03.155]  Warren Hatch has proposed a constitutional amendment to repeal the requirement of being a natural-born citizen.
[01:44:03.215 --> 01:44:05.557]  And he said it's for Arnold so he can be president, yeah.
[01:44:05.837 --> 01:44:06.158]  I know.
[01:44:06.278 --> 01:44:07.659]  And would you know what that number is?
[01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:09.541]  What that was, that amendment?
[01:44:09.701 --> 01:44:12.384]  I got the Hatch article here in a giant stack.
[01:44:12.404 --> 01:44:12.744]  Hold on.
[01:44:13.004 --> 01:44:13.284]  Okay.
[01:44:13.725 --> 01:44:14.466]  I think I just found it.
[01:44:14.606 --> 01:44:15.026]  Here it is.
[01:44:15.106 --> 01:44:16.968]  Salt Lake City Tribune Associated Press.
[01:44:17.028 --> 01:44:18.650]  Hatch for foreign-born Oakpools?
[01:44:19.531 --> 01:44:20.812]  Robert Dirk?
[01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:30.014]  As the writer, and it says, Senator Orrin Hatch wants to terminate the constitutional prohibition against foreign-born citizens, as Arnold Schwarzenegger and others, from becoming President.
[01:44:30.074 --> 01:44:38.879]  Article 2 of the Constitution says that no person with an actual born citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution shall be eligible for the office of President.
[01:44:39.359 --> 01:44:46.703]  Hatch is seeking to amend the Constitution to remove the ban, allowing anyone who has been a citizen of the United States for two decades to run for the country's highest office.
[01:44:47.859 --> 01:44:50.542]  And they'll need a constitutional convention to do that.
[01:44:51.042 --> 01:44:53.385]  And now they're admitting they want to rewrite whole sections of it.
[01:44:53.805 --> 01:45:01.332]  And the minute the ComCon starts, the feds will launch massive terror attacks, create hysteria, and then rewrite the entire thing.
[01:45:01.993 --> 01:45:02.614]  Be right back.

[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:11.989]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:17.016]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:47:17.236 --> 01:47:22.883]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:23.843]  We're good to go.
[01:47:38.749 --> 01:47:39.549]  Much, much more.
[01:47:39.729 --> 01:47:42.250]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:49.211]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:47:49.411 --> 01:47:54.672]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:47:54.692 --> 01:47:55.092]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:48:18.277 --> 01:48:20.399]  Yeah, I appreciate what you're doing Alex.
[01:48:20.419 --> 01:48:22.100]  My priority, I was in nuclear weapons in the military.
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:29.547]  And my priority is to get this message across to the parents and the wives and husbands of the people over in the far Middle East.
[01:48:46.306 --> 01:48:48.027]  About this Neutron situation.
[01:48:48.347 --> 01:48:49.047]  Could I share it?
[01:48:50.747 --> 01:48:51.408]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:48:52.168 --> 01:49:00.210]  Well, if you've got Google, pull up Neutron exposure symptoms.
[01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:07.372]  You've got a bunch of research to do there, and you know we've got some serious things happening in the Middle East.
[01:49:08.833 --> 01:49:14.455]  Two nights ago, I got into a discussion with this gentleman about the Neutron situation.
[01:49:16.348 --> 01:49:18.049]  The radio, the computer radio.
[01:49:18.089 --> 01:49:20.691]  But anyway, I took the issue with him.
[01:49:20.931 --> 01:49:22.392]  You're talking about neutron bombs?
[01:49:22.613 --> 01:49:22.953]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:24.254 --> 01:49:31.439]  For those that don't know, a neutron bomb detonates with a radiation burst, kills all life, and then troops can roll in a day later.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:37.904]  Well, the point is, sir, these gentlemen, their bodies are shut down over there now.
[01:49:39.325 --> 01:49:42.087]  That is symptoms of the neutron exposure.
[01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:53.384]  And we need to investigate this because these guys that are standing over there I suspect are guinea pigs for the weaponry.
[01:49:54.645 --> 01:49:56.186]  Well, they always do that to the Tribs.
[01:49:56.246 --> 01:49:56.967]  I mean, it's admitted.
[01:49:57.107 --> 01:50:02.071]  This government killed Tribs in the 80s, which spray stuff on them and kill them, and then just, that's the government.
[01:50:02.091 --> 01:50:02.911]  That's who runs things.
[01:50:03.211 --> 01:50:13.299]  So, but we've got the computer age now, and we're starting to learn, and we're starting to be able to shut the televisions off, and getting on the computer, and becoming a little bit halfway intelligent with these people.
[01:50:14.019 --> 01:50:15.200]  Oh yeah, that's what's happening, yeah.
[01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:17.502]  Now, let's go to Mel Gibson.
[01:50:18.632 --> 01:50:28.397]  You know, the ADL, their pet project, and they was created in 1913, and that's the same year that the Federal Reserve was created.
[01:50:30.578 --> 01:50:41.943]  Now, we've got to understand that the ADL has power in this country and throughout the world, and if you go up against the ADL, there's no telling what'll happen to you, which I don't give a damn.
[01:50:42.043 --> 01:50:43.344]  I'm sorry, I don't care.
[01:50:43.364 --> 01:50:47.186]  I fought overseas, and you know, I might as well fight in this country.
[01:50:48.444 --> 01:50:52.188]  But we've got to get behind Mel Gibson and help that young man.
[01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:55.110]  He's put his resources up.
[01:50:55.190 --> 01:50:56.331]  He's put his talent up.
[01:50:57.372 --> 01:50:58.974]  He's trying to get a message across.
[01:50:59.034 --> 01:51:02.577]  And here we sit and we just talk about it like that judge in Alabama.
[01:51:05.171 --> 01:51:14.234]  Arnold can say he admires Hitler, hangs out with top Nazis to this day, defends him, and they say he's good, Simon Wiesenthal.
[01:51:14.515 --> 01:51:18.996]  And the same guy that runs it then attacks Gibson and says, don't let this film come out.
[01:51:19.276 --> 01:51:25.599]  Well, we've got to get behind Gibson and says, it's coming out!
[01:51:25.639 --> 01:51:31.341]  You know, if you read a book that Henry Ford wrote years ago about the international Jew,
[01:51:32.233 --> 01:51:44.178]  You're going to find that these five Jews that came over with Christopher Columbus, sold all of Queen Isabel's money, when they got back, you know who went to jail?
[01:51:44.198 --> 01:51:45.638]  Columbus!
[01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:47.779]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:51:47.819 --> 01:51:51.681]  You know, I don't think that Jews run the New World Order.
[01:51:52.201 --> 01:51:57.943]  And what I'm saying about Arnold is, the guy's an admitted Nazi and he's being defended.
[01:51:58.857 --> 01:52:00.738]  Okay, this is very opportunistic.
[01:52:00.818 --> 01:52:08.443]  And then anybody who's standing up against the New World Order, whether it's run by Chinese or Germans or Jews, is being called an anti-Semite, and that's wrong.
[01:52:08.923 --> 01:52:24.132]  And to take a book, the Bible, and to make a movie out of it, pretty standard, folks, by people that have seen it, The Passion, and then to call that anti-Semitic while defending a guy that says he admires Hitler, and who defends Kurt Voltheim, we've got a serious problem.
[01:52:25.973 --> 01:52:27.914]  And that's what I've been saying all along here.
[01:52:30.393 --> 01:52:31.454]  And it's terrible.
[01:52:32.275 --> 01:52:32.755]  It's terrible.
[01:52:32.855 --> 01:52:36.098]  And Hitler was a bad guy, and he got funded by the globalists.
[01:52:38.079 --> 01:52:41.442]  So it's a little bit more sophisticated than just one group running things.
[01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:48.207]  But it is despicable, though, to defend Arnold Schwarzenegger and then go after Mel Gibson, who's done nothing.
[01:52:49.428 --> 01:52:51.409]  All right, 3rd Hour, your calls, bunch of news.
[01:52:51.469 --> 01:52:51.970]  Stay with us.
[01:52:54.429 --> 01:53:00.637]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident... Would you be prepared?
[01:53:01.317 --> 01:53:12.491]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:20.642]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.302 --> 01:53:22.383]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.083 --> 01:53:24.184]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.825 --> 01:53:25.665]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.426 --> 01:53:27.306]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.326 --> 01:53:31.610]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.170 --> 01:53:36.273]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.033 --> 01:53:41.116]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now 25 seconds into the third and final hour.
[01:53:41.136 --> 01:53:46.180]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, and then back from 9 to midnight.
[01:53:47.221 --> 01:53:48.742]  We are about to be going to, uh,
[01:53:51.391 --> 01:53:57.753]  To Lou and Tim and Linda and Manuel and Joe and others.
[01:53:58.933 --> 01:53:59.753]  So stay with us.
[01:54:00.974 --> 01:54:02.974]  Some of the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:03.274 --> 01:54:04.294]  This has now come out.
[01:54:04.334 --> 01:54:07.855]  It was Condoleezza Rice who warned Willie Brown not to fly on 9-1-1.
[01:54:07.875 --> 01:54:13.517]  The San Francisco Chronicle and others who admitted, Willie Brown admitted that he was told the day before not to fly to New York that day.
[01:54:14.272 --> 01:54:16.714]  Now, it turns out it was Condoleezza Rice telling him not to do that.
[01:54:16.754 --> 01:54:18.355]  We have this on Infowars.com.
[01:54:18.896 --> 01:54:29.724]  They're going to shift over in most of the big colleges to making them Homeland Security Departments, where that's, if you want a job, that's what you got to be, basically, to set this bureaucracy in place of the ultra-police state.
[01:54:30.465 --> 01:54:31.126]  And that's coming up.
[01:54:31.206 --> 01:54:33.007]  More on the death of Dr. David Kelly.
[01:54:33.848 --> 01:54:35.289]  Bunch of Second Amendment news.
[01:54:35.429 --> 01:54:38.131]  More on the Nazi Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:54:39.592 --> 01:54:40.373]  And I can say that.
[01:54:40.433 --> 01:54:43.796]  I mean, the guy said in the video, Pumping Iron, that he admired Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:45.808 --> 01:54:46.748]  That's MSNBC.
[01:54:46.788 --> 01:54:47.288]  I've seen it.
[01:54:47.308 --> 01:54:47.769]  I remembered that.
[01:54:47.789 --> 01:54:48.989]  I went, wow, I'd forgotten about that.
[01:54:49.809 --> 01:54:57.312]  He defended Kurt Volta when it came out that he was a Gestapo guy who killed a bunch of people and got awards for it in Serbia during that oppression.
[01:54:58.612 --> 01:55:04.874]  And he calls the former head of the Austrian parliament, his uncle, who married his mother after his dad died.
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.201]  Just incredible.
[01:55:07.241 --> 01:55:11.803]  And the Simon Wiesenthal Center that he's given millions to is saying, oh, he's a good guy.
[01:55:11.823 --> 01:55:13.084]  He's a model citizen.
[01:55:13.104 --> 01:55:16.586]  We've given him awards, but they're going after Mel Gibson for the passion.
[01:55:16.626 --> 01:55:17.767]  This really makes me angry.
[01:55:18.868 --> 01:55:20.589]  So we'll be talking about that as well.
[01:55:20.889 --> 01:55:22.270]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:24.651]  Let's talk to Lou in Colorado.
[01:55:24.991 --> 01:55:25.852]  Lou, you're on the air.
[01:55:26.092 --> 01:55:26.832]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:27.173 --> 01:55:27.493]  Welcome.
[01:55:28.186 --> 01:55:29.287]  How you doing?
[01:55:29.567 --> 01:55:33.149]  I had a few questions here, because things go fast on your show.
[01:55:33.429 --> 01:55:37.672]  You said in Pennsylvania there was a law made that preacher cannot cite the Old Testament?
[01:55:38.572 --> 01:55:43.815]  Yes, they said if they read passages criticizing homosexuals or others, they can be arrested or fined.
[01:55:43.835 --> 01:55:45.076]  The Republican governor signed it.
[01:55:45.754 --> 01:55:45.914]  Hmm.
[01:55:46.574 --> 01:55:47.635]  And where was that article?
[01:55:47.655 --> 01:55:48.816]  It was Governor Schweiker.
[01:55:49.516 --> 01:55:52.898]  Associated Press, CNS News, all over the place.
[01:55:53.498 --> 01:55:53.738]  Wow.
[01:55:53.838 --> 01:55:54.559]  Unbelievable.
[01:55:54.579 --> 01:55:55.059]  Last year.
[01:55:55.279 --> 01:56:00.042]  And I just read... Is that the freedom of religion to speak out on stuff or whatever and quote passages from Bible books?
[01:56:00.062 --> 01:56:09.567]  I'd like to say... Well, it's just the rest of the guy who called a Pakistan person a Paki, and whether you're... I mean, that's just an abbreviation, but whether it is racist or not, it's free speech, folks.
[01:56:09.867 --> 01:56:10.067]  Yeah.
[01:56:10.668 --> 01:56:15.414]  You know, I mean, this stuff is just so, well, like I say, you can see the inconsistencies on something.
[01:56:15.474 --> 01:56:25.927]  In one breath, they, you know, they put programs on about the Nazis and how bad they are, and then the next breath, you know, they're allowing certain
[01:56:26.765 --> 01:56:29.167]  People that favor Nazism, they're okay.
[01:56:29.187 --> 01:56:30.588]  You can see these inconsistencies.
[01:56:30.608 --> 01:56:31.969]  Well, it's like Martin Singer.
[01:56:31.989 --> 01:56:37.573]  She gave awards to Hitler, got awards from Hitler, the founder of Planned Parenthood, and the liberals just love her.
[01:56:37.813 --> 01:56:41.956]  Yeah, and two books that had the body of secret shows that were a lot of
[01:56:42.412 --> 01:56:56.496]  Nazis that were allowed into cryptology, I guess you'd call it, or, you know, cyphering information, that were allowed to come in... Echelon, drug running, setting up Fort Benning, Georgia, and torture, Klaus Barbie and drug dealing.
[01:56:56.796 --> 01:56:57.976]  I don't like these Nazis!
[01:56:58.336 --> 01:56:59.716]  And I don't like the government defending them!
[01:57:00.076 --> 01:57:05.898]  And the same thing with Bluebird, the project of Bluebird, where the guy talks about CIA stuff on mind control.
[01:57:06.358 --> 01:57:11.181]  And there again, certain Nazis were allowed in because... Well, it's like Joseph Mengele.
[01:57:11.221 --> 01:57:12.842]  They protected him for his research.
[01:57:12.962 --> 01:57:15.504]  And folks, didn't they say torture is good?
[01:57:15.544 --> 01:57:17.285]  Well, Joseph Mengele was good then?
[01:57:17.305 --> 01:57:17.846]  Yeah.
[01:57:18.206 --> 01:57:20.728]  So as long as they help the system, it doesn't make any difference.
[01:57:20.788 --> 01:57:22.889]  As long as they can use these guys to help the system,
[01:57:23.328 --> 01:57:26.209]  To further use their control.
[01:57:26.409 --> 01:57:27.830]  They're good enough to use, you know.
[01:57:27.850 --> 01:57:28.230]  That's it.
[01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:31.572]  And you're now anti-Semitic if you're against Arnold, who is an admitted Nazi.
[01:57:31.792 --> 01:57:32.372]  Right.
[01:57:32.492 --> 01:57:34.033]  See, see, notice the double think there.
[01:57:34.433 --> 01:57:37.875]  Don't stand up against Nazis, or you'll be listed as a racist.
[01:57:38.055 --> 01:57:39.855]  Yeah, I mean, it's so all over the place.
[01:57:39.895 --> 01:57:48.259]  The question is, how do you get people, you know, I would love to contact some people to call up on your show, because there has to be a way to get a hold of people that have the same views as you.
[01:57:48.279 --> 01:57:52.041]  You know, you can work to get out judges and other things that do this stuff, you know.
[01:57:52.901 --> 01:57:57.785]  Uh, I also found this guy, this book by James, The Body of Secrets by James Bramford.
[01:57:57.825 --> 01:57:59.146]  Yeah, we've interviewed him.
[01:57:59.166 --> 01:57:59.446]  Pardon?
[01:58:00.347 --> 01:58:01.528]  We have interviewed him.
[01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:02.048]  Yeah.
[01:58:02.489 --> 01:58:05.831]  Uh, I find his book, though, a little, uh, one-sided on stuff.
[01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:08.253]  He makes a lot of stuff, writes statements and stuff.
[01:58:08.313 --> 01:58:11.876]  He gives credit to, uh, to Al Gore's, uh, Bob... Stay there!
[01:58:16.377 --> 01:58:18.337]  A good healthy heart is serious business.
[01:58:18.898 --> 01:58:23.118]  It's well known that heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in America today.
[01:58:23.138 --> 01:58:26.599]  A cause that in a lot of cases could have been prevented.
[01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:32.700]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to help improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:20.007]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:20.167 --> 01:59:24.614]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:24.754 --> 01:59:29.121]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:30.523]  The New World Order.
[01:59:32.184 --> 01:59:36.506]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:36.566 --> 01:59:43.508]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:43.628 --> 01:59:45.728]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:46.008 --> 01:59:56.452]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:56.632 --> 01:59:57.892]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:59:57.892 --> 01:59:58.072]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:00:14.970 --> 02:00:17.991]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:00:18.291 --> 02:00:23.232]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:00:23.472 --> 02:00:27.832]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:00:28.133 --> 02:00:37.034]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:00:37.254 --> 02:00:40.875]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:00:41.155 --> 02:00:46.225]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:00:46.486 --> 02:00:53.199]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:00:53.692 --> 02:00:54.332]  What about you?
[02:00:54.993 --> 02:01:00.356]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:01:03.498 --> 02:01:06.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:08.482]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:24.884 --> 02:01:26.564]  All right, back to open phones.
[02:01:26.584 --> 02:01:28.145]  Your calls, my friends.
[02:01:29.085 --> 02:01:31.565]  We're talking to Lou in Colorado.
[02:01:31.585 --> 02:01:34.206]  And he was talking about James Bamford.
[02:01:34.226 --> 02:01:35.306]  He wrote Body of Secrets.
[02:01:35.366 --> 02:01:37.826]  He got the Northwoods document, which the government's now released.
[02:01:37.906 --> 02:01:41.967]  And ABC News in Baltimore Sun reported on the official U.S.
[02:01:42.027 --> 02:01:52.269]  government plan to carry out hijackings of airliners of college students, to crash them, to blame it on enemies, to kill astronauts and blame it on foreign countries, to commit sniper attacks in D.C.
[02:01:52.749 --> 02:01:53.969]  and blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:01:55.155 --> 02:02:03.059]  I read a lot, and I catch inconsistencies and stuff.
[02:02:03.079 --> 02:02:08.661]  Here's the guy that's supposed to be doing it.
[02:02:08.742 --> 02:02:12.343]  You know, he has a tendency to badmouth Birch.
[02:02:12.363 --> 02:02:22.468]  He has a tendency, the way he writes, in which the right wing, always the right wing, we've got the quote in there from what's-his-name's father, Al Gore's father, who in fact
[02:02:23.473 --> 02:02:29.200]  It was admitted by, it got it on accidental, was it?
[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:33.725]  Albert Gore Sr., the admitted minion of Armand Hammer.
[02:02:33.826 --> 02:02:35.448]  Right, in the back pocket of him.
[02:02:35.888 --> 02:02:39.613]  And Hammer financed the Communists with big money.
[02:02:40.313 --> 02:02:45.895]  He was loved by the communists, and so it makes you wonder, well, was this Cuban thing... Well, this is what happens.
[02:02:45.935 --> 02:02:46.535]  Let me break it down.
[02:02:46.595 --> 02:02:47.115]  Let me break it down.
[02:02:47.395 --> 02:02:55.338]  They know we're going to find out about corruption, so they'll have a right-winger expose the left's corruption, but make sure the mass is blind to conservative corruption.
[02:02:55.738 --> 02:03:00.160]  They'll have a left-winger expose right-wing corruption, but never expose left-wing corruption.
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.901]  And the fact that at the top, they're all corrupt.
[02:03:02.961 --> 02:03:04.241]  Now, here's an example.
[02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:09.643]  Limbaugh came out, and I've got the text of his comments, and said, so what if Arnold's dad was a Nazi guy?
[02:03:10.263 --> 02:03:17.187]  You know, Joseph Kennedy was pro-Nazi, and we don't go after him, and of course he doesn't point out, well, wait a minute, yeah, Arnold married into these people.
[02:03:17.807 --> 02:03:20.168]  You know, two wrongs don't make a right, as a caller said.
[02:03:21.509 --> 02:03:24.270]  But the point is, Arnold is in 2003.
[02:03:24.991 --> 02:03:26.471]  Arnold is hanging out with Kurt Voltheim.
[02:03:26.491 --> 02:03:29.473]  There's a photo of him on my website from last year with Kurt Voltheim.
[02:03:30.211 --> 02:03:33.152]  He's saying that he, quote, admires Hitler.
[02:03:33.792 --> 02:03:36.734]  So, you know, that's my whole point here.
[02:03:36.794 --> 02:03:55.321]  But then, but then, but then, but then, Second Amendment groups, and Mel Gibson, and Steve Voss, and stuff that has never even said anything about Israel or the Jews, they suddenly are being listed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, while the same rabbi that heads it is praising Arnold!
[02:03:55.821 --> 02:03:57.502]  Yeah, I mean, you'd be listed as a
[02:03:57.962 --> 02:04:02.443]  As a Nazi, if you may, without a doubt, said something like that.
[02:04:02.823 --> 02:04:04.684]  And yeah, the inconsistencies there are so much.
[02:04:05.024 --> 02:04:09.885]  But in his book, too, he mentions that Pearl Harbor, America, was caught by surprise.
[02:04:09.925 --> 02:04:12.526]  He does that also with this MacArthur thing.
[02:04:12.766 --> 02:04:13.886]  And that is absolutely wrong.
[02:04:13.966 --> 02:04:17.728]  Yeah, what he'll do is, he'll take an admitted document and he'll spin it.
[02:04:17.768 --> 02:04:18.988]  But we don't go off Bamford.
[02:04:19.028 --> 02:04:21.409]  We go off the declassified documents and read them.
[02:04:21.469 --> 02:04:23.089]  Thanks for the call, Lou.
[02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:24.389]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:24.469 --> 02:04:25.750]  Tim in Washington State.
[02:04:25.770 --> 02:04:26.410]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:04:27.409 --> 02:04:27.749]  Thank you.
[02:04:27.989 --> 02:04:28.569]  Hello, Alex?
[02:04:28.689 --> 02:04:28.989]  Yes.
[02:04:29.310 --> 02:04:30.410]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:34.191]  I'm a first-time caller and I've been listening for about eight months now.
[02:04:35.091 --> 02:04:39.232]  I just wanted to ask you if you were familiar with the story of Albert Caron?
[02:04:41.253 --> 02:04:41.533]  No.
[02:04:42.013 --> 02:04:52.275]  Albert Caron grew up as a ward of mob boss Vito Genovese and was himself a made man and a mob in addition to having reached the rank of colonel in the army.
[02:04:53.276 --> 02:04:54.536]  His military assignments
[02:04:55.353 --> 02:05:00.454]  Included tours of Dodi in World War II, the Korean War, and in Vietnam.
[02:05:01.135 --> 02:05:06.236]  Now we know they used the mob as a hit arm of the CIA.
[02:05:06.596 --> 02:05:07.196]  Absolutely.
[02:05:07.617 --> 02:05:13.678]  And throughout his military career, he also worked for the CIA and his assignments brought him into the DEA as well.
[02:05:15.559 --> 02:05:23.321]  He worked both sides of the war on drugs, essentially, and was personally acquainted with George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Barry Steele, Oliver North,
[02:05:23.942 --> 02:05:27.524]  was himself involved with these men in CIA-sanctioned drug trafficking.
[02:05:28.645 --> 02:05:42.693]  And following an assignment in the late 80s when he and an associate were ordered to massacre an entire village in Mexico in order to teach them a lesson, Caron became disillusioned with his work and attempted to quit, but knew that he would not be allowed to do so.
[02:05:44.354 --> 02:05:48.096]  In relating this to his daughter, he stated to the effect that they'll be coming for me soon.
[02:05:48.637 --> 02:05:52.419]  And Caron soon took ill with a disease of unknown etiology
[02:05:53.095 --> 02:06:01.082]  Which was causing brain shrinkage and causing his internal organs to liquefy as we've been hearing with these Gulf War fighters.
[02:06:02.223 --> 02:06:10.210]  And they call it pneumonia when they admit that the first guy to die called his dad and said we're hauling hazardous stuff.
[02:06:11.251 --> 02:06:12.032]  Classified.
[02:06:12.052 --> 02:06:14.714]  I just wanted to touch upon that.
[02:06:15.094 --> 02:06:18.297]  I heard you speaking with Joyce Riley on that subject a little while ago.
[02:06:19.711 --> 02:06:28.016]  It's been ringing back to this story with me every time I've been hearing a mention of that, and I've been trying to get through online, and it's extremely difficult.
[02:06:28.116 --> 02:06:29.797]  I'm glad you got such great listenership.
[02:06:31.057 --> 02:06:36.800]  Well, I appreciate the call, and yeah, I'm aware of Barry Seal and the Clintons and the Bushes.
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.661]  I mean, that's all it is.
[02:06:37.681 --> 02:06:46.086]  We've got an organized crime syndicate that owns Madison Avenue and the spin machines, and they're selling us slavery right now.
[02:06:46.166 --> 02:06:46.726]  Thanks for the call.
[02:06:47.782 --> 02:06:49.763]  Let's talk to Linda in Wisconsin.
[02:06:49.783 --> 02:06:50.544]  Linda, you're on the air.
[02:06:50.564 --> 02:06:51.004]  Go ahead.
[02:06:51.024 --> 02:06:51.765]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:51.925 --> 02:06:53.066]  Two things quickly.
[02:06:53.086 --> 02:06:59.990]  I received a call today from a police officer who was asking me for funds.
[02:07:00.911 --> 02:07:03.933]  But what was interesting is he gave me an incentive.
[02:07:04.553 --> 02:07:10.337]  And I'm sorry I didn't get more details because what happened after that was very alarming.
[02:07:11.137 --> 02:07:12.799]  First of all, he told me that
[02:07:14.737 --> 02:07:19.582]  They would give a $300 reward for anyone turning in a burglar.
[02:07:19.602 --> 02:07:25.567]  So, of course, that means you're going to be on the outlook, aren't you, for anyone that looks suspicious?
[02:07:26.488 --> 02:07:41.081]  But then the next thing that happened, I was telling him about Homeland Security and the Patriot Act 1 and so on, and about how our sheriff would be brought down to the level of a police officer, and that our government was
[02:07:42.257 --> 02:07:48.081]  Um, bringing the police force under a militarized, um, police force.
[02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:49.722]  And he said, oh, that would be good.
[02:07:49.742 --> 02:07:53.684]  So at that point, I talked to him about the Constitution, etc.
[02:07:53.704 --> 02:07:54.544]  So that would be good.
[02:07:54.584 --> 02:07:58.507]  It's good in Russia, it's good in Germany, it was good in Austria, but, uh, yeah.
[02:07:58.667 --> 02:08:00.048]  Right, I brought that out to him.
[02:08:00.068 --> 02:08:08.873]  Okay, the next point is, this is on the homosexual movement, and, okay, here is this information I have.
[02:08:09.935 --> 02:08:18.901]  Um, back in April of 1999, there was a bill presented and evidently it passed, but this is what we need to find out.
[02:08:19.521 --> 02:08:24.844]  The bill was, and everyone get your pens out and write this down and do your homework, people.
[02:08:25.304 --> 02:08:31.328]  We need to find out about this, but I think this is why they're being so in our face and pushing all this.
[02:08:31.388 --> 02:08:32.028]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:08:32.169 --> 02:08:32.609]  It's HR 2431.
[02:08:35.314 --> 02:08:41.416]  And it was presented the International Freedom from Religious Persecution Act.
[02:08:42.096 --> 02:08:52.258]  It was authorized or written up by Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute and he's who gave us Goals 2000.
[02:08:52.758 --> 02:08:54.459]  Also he worked with
[02:08:56.005 --> 02:08:56.586]  I think?
[02:09:11.738 --> 02:09:26.501]  As it puts us, under the International Criminal Court in The Hague, it also formed a department commission to monitor religion, and that was under Robert Seiple of the World Vision, and at that point, with Madeleine Albright.
[02:09:27.562 --> 02:09:31.447]  Yeah, of course, we covered that at the time.
[02:09:31.707 --> 02:09:40.697]  But look, that's why USA Today reported and everybody else that, oh, our Supreme Court follows the orders of the foreign courts now.
[02:09:40.797 --> 02:09:42.479]  They're the higher court.
[02:09:43.837 --> 02:09:47.661]  Yeah, there's no attorney-client privilege now, and yeah, we're getting rid of juries.
[02:09:47.721 --> 02:09:49.243]  It's the new system.
[02:09:49.303 --> 02:09:52.266]  Okay, but now here's the twist of it.
[02:09:52.746 --> 02:10:00.094]  It says, for example, now that I'm reading from this, for example, if the practice of homosexuality becomes defined
[02:10:00.094 --> 02:10:05.598]  Yeah, they're trying to sell us the system, and they're going to use neocons to sneak it through on us, and it is
[02:10:21.846 --> 02:10:26.249]  I mean, I just read the article in England where the guy used a word and they arrested him.
[02:10:26.289 --> 02:10:29.152]  This is the Scotland Yard Diversity Unit.
[02:10:29.392 --> 02:10:31.433]  Now, here's what they're doing in the states.
[02:10:31.934 --> 02:10:42.562]  In the state of Utah, New York, Rhode Island, and Michigan, they passed legislation which was called neutral, what was it?
[02:10:43.503 --> 02:10:44.323]  Gender neutral.
[02:10:44.343 --> 02:10:45.424]  Gender neutral.
[02:10:45.444 --> 02:10:47.886]  They have passed that legislation.
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:51.922]  This is evil beyond anything.
[02:10:52.122 --> 02:10:52.582]  I hear you.
[02:10:52.623 --> 02:10:53.283]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:53.303 --> 02:10:54.504]  Appreciate it, Linda.
[02:10:55.385 --> 02:10:58.368]  Let's talk to, uh, who's up next there?
[02:10:59.509 --> 02:11:00.851]  Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:11:00.891 --> 02:11:01.411]  Go ahead.
[02:11:01.992 --> 02:11:02.592]  Yes, Alex.
[02:11:02.612 --> 02:11:06.016]  First, I'd like to say your latest video, Police Day 3, expertly done.
[02:11:07.117 --> 02:11:07.537]  Very good.
[02:11:07.998 --> 02:11:10.260]  Lays it out as absolute, whether you serve good or evil.
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:11.461]  I mean, it's two documentaries.
[02:11:12.429 --> 02:11:13.430]  Very, very good work.
[02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:17.252]  It's our longest film too, at 2 hours and 40 minutes.
[02:11:17.572 --> 02:11:18.113]  It sure is.
[02:11:18.133 --> 02:11:19.834]  When I first watched it, I watched it all the way through.
[02:11:20.614 --> 02:11:21.435]  Oh yeah, it is long.
[02:11:22.736 --> 02:11:30.741]  I'd like to say that this homosexuals, we can't call them perverts, but uh, they get on TV every day, these pundits, and they call us terrorists for speaking out the truth.
[02:11:31.521 --> 02:11:32.442]  And a double think is that.
[02:11:34.199 --> 02:11:40.924]  Well, look, it's the First Amendment, and I'll fight to the death for anybody to have the right to say what they feel, what they believe.
[02:11:41.425 --> 02:11:43.206]  But no, it's all one-sided.
[02:11:43.746 --> 02:11:45.728]  I got on this Jewish radio network.
[02:11:45.888 --> 02:11:46.909]  They were talking about the government.
[02:11:46.929 --> 02:11:48.130]  I think the guy's even a neocon.
[02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:52.013]  One time I tried to tell him about 9-11, how we were attacked by the globalists.
[02:11:52.133 --> 02:11:52.933]  He doesn't understand.
[02:11:52.953 --> 02:11:54.535]  We're under a system of indirect rule.
[02:11:54.575 --> 02:11:55.655]  This is all smoke and mirrors.
[02:11:56.496 --> 02:11:59.098]  And he tells me, he had another caller on after me.
[02:11:59.118 --> 02:12:00.119]  They were howling like wolves.
[02:12:00.779 --> 02:12:02.341]  They said the full moon must be out.
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:04.900]  These guys, they just don't get it.
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:07.021]  We're on a Luciferian chessboard.
[02:12:07.041 --> 02:12:08.082]  We've been reduced to pawns.
[02:12:08.602 --> 02:12:09.342]  They don't want to see that.
[02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:14.364]  Well, I mean, it's everybody, regardless of where they're from.
[02:12:14.504 --> 02:12:14.904]  No, no, no.
[02:12:14.924 --> 02:12:16.144]  That's not the point I'm trying to make.
[02:12:16.184 --> 02:12:20.446]  I'm just saying, he just happens to be Jewish and he doesn't get what's going on.
[02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:22.748]  A lot of people don't.
[02:12:22.788 --> 02:12:24.609]  That's why we have to reach out to them and wake them up.
[02:12:24.889 --> 02:12:25.709]  I tried to do that.
[02:12:25.810 --> 02:12:27.991]  I even hit them with the Northwoods document.
[02:12:28.031 --> 02:12:28.651]  I told them about that.
[02:12:28.691 --> 02:12:29.492]  I got your website.
[02:12:29.532 --> 02:12:31.393]  I'll prison plan it about three or four times.
[02:12:31.473 --> 02:12:32.273]  Oh, that's awesome.
[02:12:32.593 --> 02:12:33.854]  Well, the guy, he does let you speak.
[02:12:34.114 --> 02:12:34.655]  I'll give him that.
[02:12:35.155 --> 02:12:35.815]  He lets you speak.
[02:12:35.915 --> 02:12:37.196]  That's what I don't understand about him.
[02:12:37.236 --> 02:12:40.798]  That's one of those shows where they'll censor you.
[02:12:40.818 --> 02:12:41.879]  They'll screen your call.
[02:12:43.491 --> 02:12:49.734]  I mean, if you're coherent and have a point to make here locally in Austin on some of these stations, they will not let you on, Manuel.
[02:12:50.134 --> 02:12:52.035]  Well, this guy, I give him credit and I told him.
[02:12:52.075 --> 02:12:52.415]  He does.
[02:12:52.515 --> 02:12:53.235]  He calls you.
[02:12:53.355 --> 02:12:55.496]  He does actually say on his show, if you disagree, call in.
[02:12:56.037 --> 02:12:56.637]  We'll give you time.
[02:12:56.657 --> 02:12:57.097]  I do give him that.
[02:12:57.117 --> 02:12:57.737]  Well, that's good.
[02:12:57.837 --> 02:13:01.679]  But, yeah, this thing where they go, oh, Grassy Hill conspiracy theory.
[02:13:01.859 --> 02:13:03.520]  Oh, there must be a full moon out.
[02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:05.441]  You're talking about documented stuff.
[02:13:05.461 --> 02:13:05.981]  That's crazy.
[02:13:06.881 --> 02:13:07.582]  Thanks a lot, sir.
[02:13:07.622 --> 02:13:10.803]  We'll talk to Joe in New York and others, and I am going to jump into some more of this news.
[02:13:11.463 --> 02:13:12.284]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:15:14.955 --> 02:15:18.598]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:15:19.018 --> 02:15:24.442]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:15:24.903 --> 02:15:25.964]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:15:26.024 --> 02:15:30.067]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:15:30.723 --> 02:15:44.014]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:15:44.534 --> 02:15:49.838]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:15:50.138 --> 02:15:56.023]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:16:21.416 --> 02:16:28.560]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[02:16:29.021 --> 02:16:32.823]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[02:16:33.203 --> 02:16:40.588]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[02:16:41.008 --> 02:16:50.280]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.

[02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:34.275]  We've got an article here admitting that police are going to be wired in through wireless systems to all the cameras.
[02:17:34.335 --> 02:17:36.196]  And oh, it is a federal control grid.
[02:17:36.696 --> 02:17:38.577]  Oh, it wasn't about traffic after all.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.283]  Russian colleague doubts that Dr. David Kelly committed suicide.
[02:17:43.864 --> 02:17:49.448]  Condoleezza Rice warned Willie Brown, mayor of San Francisco, not to fly to New York the day before September 11th.
[02:17:50.949 --> 02:17:54.472]  Now finding out who called him, he admitted that he was told not to fly that day.
[02:17:55.453 --> 02:17:57.875]  That is coming up in the next segment, I promise.
[02:17:58.295 --> 02:18:00.277]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[02:18:00.417 --> 02:18:01.438]  Let's go to these quick, because
[02:18:02.486 --> 02:18:03.206]  A lot of them here.
[02:18:03.766 --> 02:18:06.687]  Let's talk to Joe in New York.
[02:18:07.348 --> 02:18:08.208]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:18:08.228 --> 02:18:10.008]  Hey Alex, nice talking to you again.
[02:18:10.028 --> 02:18:11.109]  Good talking to you.
[02:18:11.729 --> 02:18:26.094]  I'm wondering if there's any connection between the Bar Association getting together after this defeat by the IRS, the lawsuit that they... Yeah, a woman won a lawsuit.
[02:18:26.114 --> 02:18:27.274]  Tell folks about that.
[02:18:27.859 --> 02:18:33.083]  Yeah, Coughlin, Vernie Coughlin, FedEx pilot, $920,000 supposedly.
[02:18:33.143 --> 02:18:37.206]  She didn't want to give a piece to the IRS and she went to court and she won.
[02:18:38.446 --> 02:18:41.909]  Saying that it was, using the argument, that it was a private group and a scam.
[02:18:42.129 --> 02:18:42.549]  Exactly.
[02:18:43.230 --> 02:18:45.131]  Tell folks about that, because I have the article yesterday.
[02:18:45.171 --> 02:18:45.912]  I never got into it.
[02:18:45.952 --> 02:18:46.432]  I should have.
[02:18:47.012 --> 02:18:51.976]  Well, supposedly, I believe in Memphis, Tennessee, she was brought to court.
[02:18:52.276 --> 02:18:53.317]  She was facing 30 years
[02:18:54.221 --> 02:18:58.705]  In prison, a million and a half dollar fine and the jury found her not guilty.
[02:18:59.185 --> 02:19:01.948]  And the funny part of it is after they were excused...
[02:19:02.841 --> 02:19:18.710]  From their service, the prosecutor told the judge, I demand you make her pay her taxes, I demand you tell her to send her her forms in, her tax returns, and the judge says to the district attorney, he says, sir, I don't work for the IRS.
[02:19:19.111 --> 02:19:20.592]  So I think this is a serious case.
[02:19:20.612 --> 02:19:22.913]  Well, they try to keep you where you never get to, a jury.
[02:19:22.973 --> 02:19:25.815]  That's what the bar has called for getting rid of juries.
[02:19:26.615 --> 02:19:27.396]  Can you believe that?
[02:19:27.516 --> 02:19:28.916]  Calling for getting rid of juries?
[02:19:28.936 --> 02:19:29.777]  They've done it, folks.
[02:19:31.906 --> 02:19:34.288]  I tell you, they really want to set up a police state, don't they?
[02:19:34.668 --> 02:19:35.949]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[02:19:36.009 --> 02:19:42.193]  I think they're seriously in trouble with the IRS being seen as non-legit.
[02:19:42.213 --> 02:19:44.554]  I think a lot of people are going to say, oh, I guess I don't have to pay my taxes.
[02:19:44.574 --> 02:19:46.455]  Well, folks, some will say, we've got to have taxes.
[02:19:46.575 --> 02:19:48.577]  Folks, it all goes to the IMF and World Bank.
[02:19:48.637 --> 02:19:49.878]  It's not a legitimate tax.
[02:19:50.338 --> 02:19:50.978]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:51.739 --> 02:19:52.940]  Really great points, Joe.
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:54.421]  Bob in New York.
[02:19:54.461 --> 02:19:55.161]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:19:57.843 --> 02:19:59.144]  Or wherever you're calling from, Bob.
[02:19:59.184 --> 02:19:59.584]  Go ahead.
[02:19:59.924 --> 02:20:01.285]  How's your finger doing there, Alex?
[02:20:02.698 --> 02:20:05.739]  My finger is totally healed and the feeling came back.
[02:20:05.759 --> 02:20:11.100]  I almost completely cut my finger off about eight weeks ago and helping some folks.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:21.062]  We were out fishing and this barge was stuck out in the lake and was kind of high waves so I jumped in to swim over and I fell off the side and my hand caught in the railing and pulled the skin right off.
[02:20:21.122 --> 02:20:21.882]  It was just a bone.
[02:20:22.082 --> 02:20:28.204]  I pulled the skin off the side of the boat, stuck it back basically on my finger and they went to the hospital.
[02:20:28.244 --> 02:20:29.284]  They sewed it together and
[02:20:30.916 --> 02:20:33.397]  It was numb until about a week ago, and the feeling's coming back.
[02:20:33.517 --> 02:20:34.397]  Well, that's good news.
[02:20:34.737 --> 02:20:41.339]  I bet you if Arnold Schwarzenegger did that to his finger that there'd be metal underneath it like all the movies he's put out.
[02:20:42.359 --> 02:20:53.022]  There's a new book coming out called Fleshing Out Skull and Bones, and I called a while back to find out when it was coming out, and I talked to this great guy named Chris Milligan.
[02:20:53.062 --> 02:20:56.403]  I guess he helped compile it, and I'm wondering if
[02:20:57.553 --> 02:20:58.994]  You might have him on the show.
[02:20:59.054 --> 02:21:04.317]  Boy, the guy is full of lots of information, and this new book is, like, real good.
[02:21:04.797 --> 02:21:06.158]  All right, well, I'll try to do that.
[02:21:06.198 --> 02:21:18.784]  We know all about Skull and Bones, Satanic Order, that our Christian leaders go to, and then they go to the Grove, and Arnie hangs out, and there's lots of fun with the German Chancellor, and very interesting.
[02:21:20.034 --> 02:21:22.655]  The website, Alex, is tryingday.com.
[02:21:23.016 --> 02:21:23.416]  All right.
[02:21:24.156 --> 02:21:24.656]  Anything else?
[02:21:25.137 --> 02:21:25.657]  No, that's it.
[02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:26.858]  Thanks a lot.
[02:21:26.938 --> 02:21:27.858]  Who's up next, Mark?
[02:21:30.279 --> 02:21:31.580]  Don in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:33.521]  Hello, Alex.
[02:21:33.541 --> 02:21:34.181]  How are you doing today?
[02:21:34.401 --> 02:21:34.782]  Fine.
[02:21:35.462 --> 02:21:37.663]  I just wanted to thank you for posting that stuff on Woodring.
[02:21:39.364 --> 02:21:39.884]  Oh, you bet.
[02:21:39.904 --> 02:21:41.165]  We're going to post the photos, too.
[02:21:41.986 --> 02:21:45.047]  I've been having real email problems the last few months trying to get stuff.
[02:21:45.267 --> 02:21:46.467]  It's been really interesting.
[02:21:46.867 --> 02:21:49.148]  I just learned how to send files over Messenger.
[02:21:49.568 --> 02:21:50.608]  Pictures and stuff like that?
[02:21:50.908 --> 02:21:51.188]  Yes.
[02:21:51.348 --> 02:21:52.549]  There's a whole bunch more pictures.
[02:21:52.629 --> 02:21:55.510]  Yeah, I got the photos of the burnt out house with the tanks smashed.
[02:21:55.570 --> 02:21:57.890]  Another mini Waco up there in Michigan.
[02:21:58.030 --> 02:21:58.750]  You got that right.
[02:21:59.310 --> 02:21:59.711]  I'll let you go.
[02:21:59.751 --> 02:22:01.031]  I know you've got a few more callers to go.
[02:22:01.191 --> 02:22:01.791]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:22:01.811 --> 02:22:02.851]  Okay, thank you.
[02:22:03.572 --> 02:22:08.013]  Okay, and then up next is Patty in Ohio.
[02:22:08.073 --> 02:22:08.833]  Patty, go ahead.
[02:22:09.699 --> 02:22:11.099]  Well, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:17.522]  I listen to you almost every day or evening and I'm very proud of you and what you're doing.
[02:22:18.622 --> 02:22:22.923]  Well, I want to thank the listeners for all your support and what everybody's doing out there to fight the globalists.
[02:22:23.043 --> 02:22:23.844]  I'm proud of you guys.
[02:22:24.104 --> 02:22:34.547]  Well, we have gotten a lot of your videos out and gotten them into the hands of people who also feel that the hour is late and we must copy them as fast as we can.
[02:22:35.453 --> 02:22:37.254]  But that's not what I'm calling about.
[02:22:37.354 --> 02:22:38.094]  Patty, stay there.
[02:22:38.495 --> 02:22:40.215]  We'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:22:40.235 --> 02:22:44.778]  I'm going to finish up with Patty, then I'm going to cover news for about 10 minutes, then I'm going to go back to calls.
[02:22:45.478 --> 02:22:47.159]  Call the free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:47.179 --> 02:22:50.260]  And I'll actually find out who the callers are from Mark.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:52.561]  He gave them to me, as usual.
[02:22:52.621 --> 02:22:53.022]  I've lost them.
[02:22:53.042 --> 02:22:53.102]  800-259-9231.
[02:22:53.122 --> 02:22:54.022]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:54.062 --> 02:22:54.782]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:23:05.729 --> 02:23:08.731]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.652 --> 02:23:12.334]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.011 --> 02:23:19.913]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:20.134 --> 02:23:25.577]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.857 --> 02:23:26.677]  Ideal for... Call 1-800-348-4100.
[02:23:26.697 --> 02:23:26.917]  That's 1-800-348-4100.
[02:23:26.938 --> 02:23:27.318]  Barclay Financial.
[02:23:27.338 --> 02:23:27.718]  Mystery Solved.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:43.861]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:23:44.341 --> 02:23:47.202]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:50.243 --> 02:23:51.523]  That's right, my friends.
[02:23:51.603 --> 02:23:52.624]  Again, thanks for joining us.
[02:23:52.804 --> 02:23:57.005]  I'm about to go back to Patty and Irene, and then I'm gonna go straight into news.
[02:23:58.206 --> 02:24:01.487]  I got so much news, I'll just take these two final calls, and I won't take any more.
[02:24:04.007 --> 02:24:10.670]  Sorry to the others that wanted to get on board, but we'll have to call back tomorrow, or I guess on Monday.
[02:24:12.529 --> 02:24:17.176]  There's a lot of news and a lot of information we need to cover, so that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:24:17.196 --> 02:24:18.318]  It's all very important.
[02:24:18.338 --> 02:24:22.385]  Before I go back to the calls though, I have published a book.
[02:24:23.314 --> 02:24:33.559]  I mean, I printed my own book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, covering September 11th and the history of government-sponsored terrorism and the developing police state and what their future plans are.
[02:24:33.659 --> 02:24:36.341]  It's 220-something pages long.
[02:24:36.461 --> 02:24:38.842]  It's 230, I forget.
[02:24:39.462 --> 02:24:42.724]  Only $12, full of graphics and diagrams and photos.
[02:24:43.618 --> 02:24:49.520]  But I've now published, I've printed, Paul Joseph Watson's book, and it is excellent!
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:25:10.126]  334 pages long, some of the latest revelations on September 11th, a lot of detail on MI5, MI6 terrorism, where they've been caught red-handed in their own country carrying out terror, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, how the Rothschilds are involved for mainstream news articles, financing the phony UFO movement, it's kind of a New Age push,
[02:25:11.658 --> 02:25:12.959]  There's too much to describe.
[02:25:12.979 --> 02:25:14.280]  I mean, this book is amazing.
[02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:15.681]  You're crazy if you don't get it.
[02:25:16.722 --> 02:25:17.783]  $19.95, folks.
[02:25:17.803 --> 02:25:17.783]  $20.
[02:25:17.983 --> 02:25:21.506]  And if you get a second book, we have a package deal.
[02:25:21.526 --> 02:25:22.587]  The second book is only $11.95.
[02:25:24.088 --> 02:25:27.110]  So get a book for yourself and one for a friend or family.
[02:25:27.571 --> 02:25:28.992]  It'll really wake folks up.
[02:25:30.313 --> 02:25:33.315]  A very scholarly work, but at the same time an easy read.
[02:25:33.455 --> 02:25:34.536]  Very well documented.
[02:25:34.696 --> 02:25:38.199]  Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism, and The New World Order.
[02:25:39.119 --> 02:25:41.800]  My videos are all over two hours long.
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:44.282]  The newest one is Police State, three total enslavement.
[02:25:44.642 --> 02:25:46.062]  They're waking a lot of people up.
[02:25:46.103 --> 02:25:48.864]  They're very well produced, very shocking information.
[02:25:50.606 --> 02:25:53.787]  See, people see all this crazy, wild news, but it's in pieces.
[02:25:53.847 --> 02:25:57.628]  We put it all together and give you a detailed picture of what's happening.
[02:25:57.688 --> 02:26:08.911]  So, whether it's America Destroyed by Design, or Police State 2000, or The Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, or Police State 3, or Police State 2, The Takeover, they're all excellent.
[02:26:09.191 --> 02:26:10.472]  They're $25.95.
[02:26:10.932 --> 02:26:12.512]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[02:26:12.752 --> 02:26:15.813]  You need to get these videos.
[02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.154]  You need to take action.
[02:26:17.194 --> 02:26:18.694]  You need to educate your friends and family.
[02:26:19.784 --> 02:26:29.270]  And I authorize listeners to make copies of my videos for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes to spread the word, to air them on AXS TV, to get them out to opinion makers.

[02:27:07.367 --> 02:27:12.331]  A lot of you know all about the New World Order and what it's all about and how it controls the neocons and the liberals.
[02:27:13.777 --> 02:27:22.801]  But your friends, your family, those in your community don't know, it is up to you folks, if we're going to survive this thing, and it's coming down to that, to educate as many people as possible.
[02:27:23.221 --> 02:27:29.263]  We're hurting the New World Order, we're damaging their programs, but they're moving ahead, folks.
[02:27:30.003 --> 02:27:36.606]  So it's a fight to the death of this Republic, or the survival of this Republic, and the defeat of the New World Order.
[02:27:38.234 --> 02:27:43.935]  So don't wait, call right now and get the new book, get the new films, get my pro-gun t-shirts, you name it.
[02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:45.175]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:27:45.916 --> 02:27:52.377]  Alright, we also have Infowars.com bumper stickers.
[02:27:53.037 --> 02:27:55.638]  Let's go to Patty in Ohio who wanted to make another point.
[02:27:55.658 --> 02:27:56.338]  Go ahead, Patty.
[02:27:56.998 --> 02:27:59.698]  Well, I wanted to say first, I have two things.
[02:28:00.639 --> 02:28:04.599]  The Jewish people, you know, there are about six kinds of Jews, I believe.
[02:28:04.639 --> 02:28:07.360]  I used to have a paper I passed out to people all the time.
[02:28:08.257 --> 02:28:15.226]  Uh, the ones that we need to be worried about are the communist Jews, and I'll tell you what, no one ever uses that word communist.
[02:28:15.487 --> 02:28:16.688]  They're still afraid of it.
[02:28:16.728 --> 02:28:20.153]  They've been afraid of it for 45 years, and I've been in this movement that long.
[02:28:20.914 --> 02:28:22.576]  They will not say communist Jews.
[02:28:23.511 --> 02:28:33.298]  Well, that's the end of that tirade that I'm on, but... Well, for those that just tuned in and are wondering why you're raising this point, you know, I don't get into whether you're German or Chinese or Jewish.
[02:28:33.879 --> 02:28:38.382]  I fight evil people, and the globalists are, really at their core, a bunch of Nazis.
[02:28:39.242 --> 02:28:48.369]  They're into breeding, they're into eugenics, they promote this, but the reason people are raising this is I talked about how the Simon Wiesenthal Center
[02:28:49.528 --> 02:29:08.037]  He's attacking Mel Gibson for his movie, The Passion, which is a direct translation of the Bible, out of English, back into Greek and Aramaic, and the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Hare, is saying, don't bring it out, we're going to boycott it, you better edit it, because it's word for word the Bible.
[02:29:08.658 --> 02:29:11.179]  And they're trying to claim that's anti-Semitic, when it's clearly not.
[02:29:11.359 --> 02:29:17.562]  Then, they're defending Arnold Schwarzenegger, for those that just joined us, we have a big section on this on InfoWars.com.
[02:29:18.712 --> 02:29:28.678]  We have Arnold a year ago visiting with Kirk Voltheim, one of the head Nazis in Serbia, killing people that saved a bunch of Jews, by the way.
[02:29:29.519 --> 02:29:35.203]  He admits that he put out a flyer distributed to thousands of people that said, kill all the Jews.
[02:29:35.223 --> 02:29:36.884]  Okay, this is MSNBC.
[02:29:37.974 --> 02:29:43.062]  Uh, we have Arnold in his movie, Pumping Iron, a documentary saying, I admire Hitler.
[02:29:43.803 --> 02:29:45.266]  Now that's on the record, folks.
[02:29:45.907 --> 02:29:51.816]  Uh, we have Arnold, who in 86, when it came out that Voltheim had become Austrian President, had been UN Secretary General.
[02:29:58.219 --> 02:30:01.020]  I don't care about this Nazi stuff.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.000]  I love Kurt Voltheim and so does my wife.
[02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:04.921]  He'll never apologize for that.
[02:30:05.321 --> 02:30:08.642]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and all these groups could care less.
[02:30:09.102 --> 02:30:14.703]  Simon Wiesenthal Center is praising him in the article and then Mel Gibson makes a movie
[02:30:15.402 --> 02:30:20.706]  Where Jesus Christ, who was a Jew, was speaking out against the corrupt church, the Pharisees.
[02:30:21.066 --> 02:30:23.748]  Not against Jews, but against the corrupt leadership.
[02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:28.231]  You know, it's like George Washington speaking out against the Crown.
[02:30:28.251 --> 02:30:29.752]  He wasn't speaking out against the English.
[02:30:29.832 --> 02:30:30.733]  He was English!
[02:30:31.513 --> 02:30:32.774]  But they turned this around.
[02:30:32.994 --> 02:30:34.335]  This is what the left does.
[02:30:34.355 --> 02:30:36.337]  The Communists, as you said.
[02:30:36.357 --> 02:30:39.759]  And say, oh, he's horrible, ban it, shut it down, whatever.
[02:30:39.779 --> 02:30:41.680]  This is amazing!
[02:30:42.021 --> 02:30:43.522]  And this is outrageous!
[02:30:44.769 --> 02:30:48.073]  And Arnold has paid millions of dollars to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[02:30:48.573 --> 02:30:51.135]  So, boy, I tell you, this is really seedy.
[02:30:51.556 --> 02:30:54.238]  Oh, God, you're getting it out, because you're doing a good job.
[02:30:54.298 --> 02:30:58.663]  You put things into words the best way I've ever heard people really make things clear.
[02:30:58.683 --> 02:31:06.370]  Hey, hey, we stand against Hitler, and we're just wondering why Simon Wiesenthal Center is giving a big award to a guy that said he admires Hitler.
[02:31:07.290 --> 02:31:09.252]  Well, it's hard for us to understand any of this.
[02:31:09.332 --> 02:31:11.954]  It keeps us... our heads swirling, it's going so fast.
[02:31:12.034 --> 02:31:14.135]  But I wanted to also... Hey, let me stop.
[02:31:14.215 --> 02:31:18.259]  I mean, I may be accused of being anti-Semitic because I'm against somebody that supports Hitler.
[02:31:18.699 --> 02:31:21.041]  I mean, now, if you don't support Hitler, you're anti-Semitic, I guess.
[02:31:21.481 --> 02:31:23.803]  I mean, I'm really... this is meant to confuse us.
[02:31:23.963 --> 02:31:24.563]  It's twisted.
[02:31:25.384 --> 02:31:34.231]  But I wanted to also say, did you hear the speech given on Friday, August 8th, by William Rivers Pitt?
[02:31:35.357 --> 02:31:35.557]  No.
[02:31:35.677 --> 02:31:36.158]  Have you heard it?
[02:31:36.338 --> 02:31:45.565]  I heard it played this morning on Joyce and Dave's program at the end, and I tell you, it brought down the house at a veterans group where he was speaking.
[02:31:45.765 --> 02:31:46.686]  What did he say?
[02:31:46.826 --> 02:31:54.652]  Well, I'll tell you, his speech should be rated up with Churchill's cheerleading speech to England to save that country.
[02:31:54.932 --> 02:31:55.552]  It's that good.
[02:31:55.572 --> 02:31:59.075]  Alright, well, thank you for the call.
[02:31:59.095 --> 02:32:00.316]  Appreciate it.
[02:32:00.336 --> 02:32:01.517]  Let's talk to Irene.
[02:32:02.618 --> 02:32:03.959]  Irene in Idaho, go ahead.
[02:32:04.039 --> 02:32:11.083]  Yeah, Alex, the reason I'm calling, what got my attention, I was born and raised in Germany.
[02:32:11.143 --> 02:32:13.344]  I was born right into the Second World War.
[02:32:13.364 --> 02:32:22.750]  And what got my attention, when you mentioned taking the children out of their families, well, I experienced a lot of that.
[02:32:22.810 --> 02:32:29.414]  My grandmother, when I was little, she had us sit in a station,
[02:32:30.572 --> 02:32:31.352]  We're good to go.
[02:33:00.265 --> 02:33:03.551]  I have no peripheral vision and I'm going to take that back.
[02:33:03.691 --> 02:33:06.376]  So you're saying the Gestapo went in and terrorized you?
[02:33:06.396 --> 02:33:08.159]  Terrorized, yes.
[02:33:09.455 --> 02:33:12.597]  Well, you better not criticize him, or you may be.
[02:33:12.737 --> 02:33:15.139]  Criticizing a Nazi means you're anti-Semitic now.
[02:33:15.639 --> 02:33:16.880]  It doesn't matter to me.
[02:33:18.681 --> 02:33:32.851]  My grandmother had a neighbor, and she was a Red Cross nurse, and my grandmother told that woman, Hitler is crazy, and she told my grandmother, if you say that one more time, I'm going to have you put against the wall and shot.
[02:33:34.318 --> 02:33:41.704]  Well, yeah, but according to them, that may be your... I mean, I don't want to say your grandmother's anti-Semitic, but standing up against Hitler may be a bad thing now.
[02:33:42.685 --> 02:33:44.827]  I'm being serious here, folks!
[02:33:45.187 --> 02:33:47.369]  It's not a bad thing for me.
[02:33:47.570 --> 02:33:50.212]  I was born into the Second World War.
[02:33:51.472 --> 02:33:54.914]  Well, ma'am, I'm getting tongue-in-cheek here, ma'am.
[02:33:56.075 --> 02:33:57.696]  Irene, I totally... God bless you.
[02:33:57.736 --> 02:33:58.797]  I'm sorry this happened to you.
[02:33:58.837 --> 02:34:01.939]  This must have been horrifying to be taken from your grandmother.
[02:34:02.479 --> 02:34:04.440]  This is what they do now here in this country.
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:05.161]  Franco did it.
[02:34:05.281 --> 02:34:07.562]  It is the eugenics, feudalist model.
[02:34:08.322 --> 02:34:17.548]  I'm just pointing out, what is it like for you then to see Arnold Schwarzenegger say that his idol is Hitler, that his role model is Hitler?
[02:34:17.868 --> 02:34:18.909]  That's one of the quotes.
[02:34:19.449 --> 02:34:24.070]  And then to hear the Simon Wiesenthal Center defend him, does that make you angry?
[02:34:24.090 --> 02:34:28.612]  It makes me angry, and people need to stand.
[02:34:29.012 --> 02:34:40.555]  You know, I admire your courage, and people need to have the courage to stand, stand, stand, and not submit to this evil.
[02:34:41.495 --> 02:34:45.076]  We're in a war of good and evil.
[02:34:45.536 --> 02:34:46.396]  What do we fight?
[02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:48.457]  We fight for the good.
[02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:50.991]  The good will win.
[02:34:51.432 --> 02:34:56.355]  Well, Hitler was big into social services, and Margaret Sanger gave awards, got awards.
[02:34:56.675 --> 02:34:57.336]  They love her.
[02:34:57.736 --> 02:34:59.637]  Why are schools still named after her?
[02:35:00.017 --> 02:35:03.500]  Because the real Nazis are supported by this government.
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:07.923]  And then those that aren't Nazis get called Nazis, and I am sick of it.
[02:35:08.723 --> 02:35:13.787]  And the people need to come together and stand together and come against it.
[02:35:14.187 --> 02:35:15.448]  There's power in unity.
[02:35:16.059 --> 02:35:16.760]  Well, you're right.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:20.182]  And a lot of people are waking up, but Peter Jennings isn't going to tell us that.
[02:35:20.463 --> 02:35:23.045]  They're not going to get their fourth Reich here in America.
[02:35:23.185 --> 02:35:24.486]  Yeah.
[02:35:24.546 --> 02:35:27.548]  Sometimes, you know, people, they're in a comfort zone.
[02:35:27.588 --> 02:35:29.029]  They don't want it any other way.
[02:35:29.550 --> 02:35:31.451]  I look at them like an egg.
[02:35:31.491 --> 02:35:32.812]  They haven't hatched out yet.
[02:35:32.832 --> 02:35:33.873]  They don't know nothing.
[02:35:34.113 --> 02:35:36.575]  They don't want to know because they're so comfortable.
[02:35:37.196 --> 02:35:38.757]  And they say, don't wreck my boat.
[02:35:38.877 --> 02:35:40.238]  I like the way I'm living.
[02:35:40.655 --> 02:35:41.916]  No, we've got to stand.
[02:35:42.356 --> 02:35:53.120]  I can, you know, maybe I get the opportunity sometimes to share my testimony of what it's been like going through, being born into a war.
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:57.522]  What was Nazi Germany like when you were a little girl?
[02:35:57.982 --> 02:36:05.946]  Well, when I was a little girl being taken away from my grandmother, and I must have been maybe three and a half years old,
[02:36:06.986 --> 02:36:08.747]  And I had a lot of back splashes.
[02:36:09.307 --> 02:36:21.754]  And what happened, the home got bombed, and then we were put on the street, and just the cardboard around our neck with our name on it, and shoved into individual homes.
[02:36:22.475 --> 02:36:26.737]  So my brothers, we were separated at that time.
[02:36:26.757 --> 02:36:33.061]  So you remember, you talked about your grandmother at the train station when they took you away.
[02:36:33.081 --> 02:36:34.161]  Yeah.
[02:36:36.850 --> 02:36:37.871]  I don't remember that.
[02:36:37.931 --> 02:36:42.835]  That was before the doctor came and then we got taken away anyway.
[02:36:42.855 --> 02:36:44.356]  The doctor came?
[02:36:44.376 --> 02:36:46.838]  Yeah, we got taken away anyway.
[02:36:46.858 --> 02:36:51.983]  But the CPS was just doing its job.
[02:36:52.043 --> 02:36:54.325]  Yeah, but my grandmother knew.
[02:36:54.365 --> 02:36:55.966]  My grandmother stood up.
[02:36:56.086 --> 02:37:02.711]  She didn't, you know, she protected us in any way she could possibly can.
[02:37:02.752 --> 02:37:05.614]  And nowadays she'd say that she was an Al-Qaeda sympathizer.
[02:37:06.985 --> 02:37:07.686]  Well, whatever.
[02:37:08.647 --> 02:37:09.587]  She stood for whatever.
[02:37:09.607 --> 02:37:10.868]  Whatever happened to your grandmother?
[02:37:11.849 --> 02:37:18.233]  My grandmother passed away about 15 years or so ago, almost 20 now.
[02:37:19.034 --> 02:37:20.915]  She must have lived to be very old then.
[02:37:21.936 --> 02:37:27.180]  She was 82, but my grandmother's love is what brought us through it.
[02:37:28.991 --> 02:37:32.675]  He loved us, and her love is really what nourished us.
[02:37:32.715 --> 02:37:33.696]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:37:33.716 --> 02:37:36.339]  Did people grovel to the men in black uniforms?
[02:37:37.540 --> 02:37:38.041]  Pardon me?
[02:37:38.401 --> 02:37:42.746]  Did the people grovel like dogs to the Nazis?
[02:37:44.107 --> 02:37:45.048]  I don't remember.
[02:37:45.068 --> 02:37:48.912]  In the war, I don't remember those things.
[02:37:51.132 --> 02:38:05.618]  I know they took my brother, my older brother, he's a year older, they took his head and dunked him in the water until he couldn't breathe anymore as a child because he was so... I mean, it's just literally terrifying.
[02:38:05.638 --> 02:38:08.599]  They're the terrorists, not us.
[02:38:09.219 --> 02:38:16.882]  They're terrifying people because they want people to be scared and submit to them and do what they want them to do.
[02:38:16.942 --> 02:38:17.963]  We have to stand.
[02:38:18.996 --> 02:38:20.237]  This is not our government.
[02:38:20.277 --> 02:38:21.499]  This is an illegitimate group.
[02:38:21.519 --> 02:38:22.620]  No, this is not our government.
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:28.125]  And I want to tell Mel Gibson I am with him all the way and my prayers are with him.
[02:38:28.946 --> 02:38:30.367]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[02:38:31.408 --> 02:38:39.616]  Yeah, Mel Gibson making a movie about Jesus is under attack, but a guy who says he loves Hitler is being supported by the government and their minions.
[02:38:39.636 --> 02:38:40.517]  This is horrible.
[02:38:41.839 --> 02:38:42.960]  Really, really bad, folks.
[02:38:44.142 --> 02:38:45.465]  Okay, let me get into some of this news.
[02:38:45.605 --> 02:38:48.390]  Russian colleague doubts Kelly committed suicide.
[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:57.086]  A Russian colleague of Dr. David Kelly, the British microbiologist who died amid a dispute on whether British authorities falsified intelligence reports on Iraq's weapons program.
[02:38:58.021 --> 02:38:58.201]  I think?
[02:38:58.221 --> 02:38:58.441]  I think?
[02:39:15.527 --> 02:39:18.269]  Intelligence reports on Saddam Hussein's arsenal.
[02:39:18.809 --> 02:39:22.752]  British police have said they are not looking for any suspects, indicating they believe the death was suicide.
[02:39:22.772 --> 02:39:24.693]  Well, the media already says it's a suicide.
[02:39:25.093 --> 02:39:28.295]  Professor Sergei Rabokov, who served as a U.N.
[02:39:28.315 --> 02:39:37.721]  weapons expert with Kelly's immediate subordinate in Iraq, and for two years, from 1996 to 1998, said the microbiologist was an unlikely person to have killed himself.
[02:39:38.042 --> 02:39:41.424]  Judging by his character, I'm very surprised to hear it was a suicide.
[02:39:42.730 --> 02:39:53.900]  The scientists said from the city of Vladimir, where he heads a rare disease laboratory at Research Institute for Animal Protection, are what really happened there, the investigation will show.
[02:39:55.121 --> 02:40:05.551]  Rabicoff recalled that Kelly was optimistic and even tempered, never losing his cool, even in the pressure of working on a team that could not always communicate well in the same language.
[02:40:07.395 --> 02:40:08.895]  Well, it was obvious he was killed, folks.
[02:40:08.915 --> 02:40:12.096]  He had electrodes on his chest, which they say had never before been seen.
[02:40:12.116 --> 02:40:15.057]  Here are some of the other news here.
[02:40:15.757 --> 02:40:23.160]  Long article on my website, and it says, uh, Condoleezza Rice warned Willie Brown not to fly on 9-1-1.
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:25.360]  That's the mayor of San Francisco.
[02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:27.781]  And it goes, uh,
[02:40:28.513 --> 02:40:36.519]  Grasping at straws and closing a loop, Connelisa Rice, the most senior black woman in the Bush administration, has leveled a charge of racism against critics of the U.S.
[02:40:36.559 --> 02:40:38.341]  drive to bring Western freedoms to the Middle East.
[02:40:38.561 --> 02:40:38.641]  Ah!
[02:40:39.181 --> 02:40:39.922]  Isn't that incredible?
[02:40:40.883 --> 02:40:52.652]  Then this former Chevron San Francisco employee got this new rhetorical tactic from San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who has managed to turn every scandal there is into an issue of race, San Francisco election fraud.
[02:40:53.661 --> 02:41:00.763]  It goes on, white people don't want blacks to have an expensive, disruptive, mafia-owned football stadium in their overtaxed, underserved neighborhood.
[02:41:01.843 --> 02:41:07.025]  It goes on, all foodie cops robbing and beating citizens, white people who complain don't like black police chief to succeed.
[02:41:07.245 --> 02:41:17.048]  It rises a lot of deep official San Francisco connections besides Chevron, Charles Schwab, San Francisco Sympathy Board of Governors, and the Transamerica Corporation.
[02:41:17.928 --> 02:41:21.569]  And then it goes on to talk about the details
[02:41:22.762 --> 02:41:26.424]  That she's the one that warned Willie Brown not to fly.
[02:41:27.184 --> 02:41:30.586]  Willie Brown told the Chronicle he was told not to fly on September 11th.
[02:41:30.606 --> 02:41:32.727]  He said, oh, I got a call from the FAA not to fly.
[02:41:33.308 --> 02:41:36.249]  Now we're hearing it's from Rice, the news article right here.
[02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:41.392]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:41.552 --> 02:41:45.975]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:46.135 --> 02:41:50.517]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:41:50.617 --> 02:41:51.878]  A New World Order.
[02:41:53.678 --> 02:41:57.901]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.961 --> 02:42:04.886]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:05.027 --> 02:42:07.088]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:07.388 --> 02:42:17.756]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.776 --> 02:42:18.597]  If you want to understand
[02:42:18.677 --> 02:42:23.424]  If you don't understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:42:49.551 --> 02:42:54.074]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:42:54.134 --> 02:43:05.482]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[02:43:06.062 --> 02:43:12.908]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:43:13.308 --> 02:43:15.450]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:43:15.930 --> 02:43:20.914]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
