[00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:06.030]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:15.197]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:16.939]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:18.760]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.241]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:21.882]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:26.405]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:30.789]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:42.989]  Alright my friends, another, well frankly terrifying edition of the Alex Jones Show as we expose the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order.
[00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.474]  But it is scary to know the truth and understand that the world is a dangerous place.
[00:00:49.374 --> 00:00:58.742]  But it's even scarier to realize that tens of millions of people, billions of people, are totally in the dark when it comes to the true nature of power and how the world works.
[00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:03.568]  Now, we're going to have open phones today.
[00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.270]  Any issue, any news item, any topic you want to discuss, you are absolutely welcome to be on this show.
[00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.051]  Whether it's the Second Amendment, or land grabbing that's going on, or victories against tyranny.
[00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.851]  We want to talk about the ongoing bloodbath in Iraq.
[00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:21.572]  We want to talk about the election in 2004.
[00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:24.573]  Who are they jockeying into position to be the next president?
[00:01:24.593 --> 00:01:25.613]  Will it be Wesley Clark?
[00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:29.714]  Will it be George W. Kennebunkport Maine Bush?
[00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.340]  These are just some of the issues that we should discuss.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.945]  Call the free number to join us on air today, or tonight, or this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in, is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:40.305]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:49.752]  By the way, the City of Austin Council, the Austin City Council, passed a resolution decrying the Patriot Act at about midnight last night.
[00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:14.425]  And I was on hand for that and gave a 15 minute speech and there was just a massive crowd of several hundred Austinites that were there who had shown up three times in the past when they kept postponing it.
[00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:23.027]  Who eloquently spoke against the Patriot Act and for the virtues of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and our God-given rights.
[00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:37.780]  There were high school students, there were black people, white people, Hispanics, Northerners, Southerners, everybody was there and I was told by viewers that I gave one of my better speeches ever there and so we'll be going over some of that
[00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:43.162]  The serious news, Senators unite behind gun bill.
[00:02:43.782 --> 00:02:46.364]  Senators unite behind gun bill.
[00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:53.050]  And yes, the Republicans and the Democrats have a draconian gun registration plan for you.
[00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.074]  Of course, and Lord Bush has said he will sign it.
[00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.216]  Latest developments, this is out of the Washington Times.
[00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.219]  This is all being updated on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:10.393]  PrisonPlanet.com as well as InfoWars.com.
[00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:15.474]  Criticism of Patriot Measures Endorsed.
[00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:20.395]  Again, City Resolution also opposes passage of USA Patriot Act 2.
[00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:21.356]  That's here in Austin.
[00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:26.277]  We'll get into poverty rises, income down, the census says.
[00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:27.817]  But remember that article last week?
[00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:32.259]  The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and government's growing.
[00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.159]  How does that work?
[00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.844]  Well, we'll break it down again with more detail.
[00:03:37.224 --> 00:03:39.204]  The real political, the real financial system.
[00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:42.385]  Also, News Observer, terrorist group under U.S.
[00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:48.566]  protection, another terror group under CIA control, as usual.
[00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:54.448]  Also, no-call list sees rescue set back.
[00:03:54.828 --> 00:04:00.449]  So, the no-call list for telemarketers, that's been put off for another couple months because of a judge's ruling.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.721]  You know, I hate telemarketers.
[00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:03.922]  I really do.
[00:04:04.142 --> 00:04:05.063]  They get on my nerves.
[00:04:05.443 --> 00:04:12.248]  But at the same time, these laws are going to be used to restrict other people lobbying or warning populations.
[00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:18.552]  And I believe if you don't like telemarketers, you should buy the telemarketer jammer little device.
[00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:20.173]  It'll only cost, I don't know, 20, 30 bucks.
[00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:21.294]  I don't know.
[00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:22.155]  What do you think about that?
[00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.176]  Having the government involved in a no-call list.
[00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:25.457]  Very dangerous trend.
[00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:29.373]  Get your response to that as well here on the show.
[00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:44.640]  Also, Little Chip and the Big Apple, they have their new implantation center in New York for the implantable chip, owned by the Communist Chinese military and IBM, through their front company Implot Digital Solutions, and they're engaging in chipping in New York now.
[00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:51.003]  Also, the Republicans are pressuring McClintock, who has a real conservative record,
[00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.633]  I mean, I'd call it leftist, but compared to Arnold, it's ultra-right-wing.
[00:04:56.434 --> 00:05:01.078]  And, uh, McClintock's being pressured by, well, Bush and, you know, the others to step down.
[00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:04.460]  You haven't been in photos with Robert Maple for it, buddy.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.701]  You're not a real conservative.
[00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:06.642]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:07.503]  You gotta step down.
[00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:13.748]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:15.769]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.711]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:27.253]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:31.654]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:35.639]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:40.545]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.389]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.893]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:48.756]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:06:06.963 --> 00:06:09.024]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.293]  It's here and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[00:06:15.714 --> 00:06:18.195]  It's the 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values.
[00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:24.279]  I love going to all the big gun shows and now I can buy with the comfort of knowing exactly what that old Winchester is really worth.
[00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.282]  Armed with the 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values makes you more knowledgeable and makes gun collecting more profitable.
[00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:36.806]  The 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains more information and firearm values than any other publication.
[00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:38.047]  Over 1,600 pages with the most

[00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:45.933]  So call now!
[00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:46.114]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:46.394]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:12.150]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.510]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.631]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:22.251]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:31.153]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:07:31.373 --> 00:07:32.753]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:37.334]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:37.934]  I think?
[00:07:56.983 --> 00:07:58.664]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:38.004]  All right, my friends, it's Open Line Friday.
[00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:42.486]  Any issue you want to discuss, who do you think the new president's going to be in the O4 election?
[00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:43.146]  Wesley Clark?
[00:08:43.326 --> 00:08:44.267]  George W. Bush?
[00:08:44.287 --> 00:08:44.787]  Doesn't matter.
[00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:46.728]  They're all skull and bones or Rhodes Scholars.
[00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:59.220]  Austin, Texas passed a resolution decrying Patriot Act 1 and 2, one of the first cities to do that, and I spoke along with hundreds of other great Austinites that were against this tyranny.
[00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:17.186]  We'll get into the Republican Party putting pressure on McClintock, the only conservative in the California recall race, and I've heard the neocon whores, that's what they are, selling out on the radio telling us how good Arnold is and how well McClintock just needs to step down.
[00:09:18.317 --> 00:09:24.961]  Because he's not anti-gun, and he's not for an open border, and, well, I guess he isn't in Robert Maple photos.
[00:09:27.002 --> 00:09:31.184]  Just such an illustration, this whole recall election of the hypocrisy.
[00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:38.708]  And there's new gun control, a national database of gun owners, and it's Republican-sponsored, of course.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.601]  And you will not hear a word of this from Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity.
[00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:52.723]  Their job is to keep you in the dark, because they're liberals, they're socialists, they're big government pimps, they're working for the man, they're there to make sure you get delivered up on a silver platter to the globalists.
[00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:57.664]  It's like George W. is, and I'm sorry if you can't figure that out, you need to wake up to it.
[00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:04.326]  Let me get into the Patriot Act right now, and what happened last night, because this is a national story.
[00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:07.107]  Not just what happened in Austin, but the
[00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.171]  First off, I've been down there three times.
[00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:36.448]  A couple months ago we were first there.
[00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:40.251]  They were going to vote on it when they saw that over 100 people showed up and signed up to speak.
[00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:42.832]  Over 100 signed up to speak and hundreds more were there.
[00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:45.754]  They postponed it.
[00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:51.378]  And then the next time 50 people showed up, 30-something signed up to speak, they postponed it again.
[00:10:51.398 --> 00:10:56.682]  And then they had people up again to speak and finally let some speak a few weeks ago and postponed it again.
[00:10:56.762 --> 00:10:58.483]  And then finally they said, okay, we will do it.
[00:10:58.883 --> 00:11:00.284]  September 25th we will vote on it.
[00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:04.298]  And over a hundred people were signed up to speak again last night.
[00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:08.480]  I'd say there were several hundred others that were there over the three or four hours while we waited.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.281]  They promised it'd be at 6.30.
[00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:12.441]  They got into the debate at about 8.30.
[00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:14.562]  It ended well after midnight.
[00:11:15.302 --> 00:11:16.683]  And I was the second speaker.
[00:11:17.423 --> 00:11:20.024]  But there was an assistant U.S.
[00:11:20.064 --> 00:11:21.745]  attorney there slithering about.
[00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:24.546]  And I walked over to the table where he was sitting.
[00:11:24.566 --> 00:11:29.148]  And he was sitting at his own designated table with Austin American Statesman writers.
[00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.451]  On both sides of it.
[00:11:32.412 --> 00:11:37.557]  These guys were in an unmitigated, unadulterated, absolute love fest.
[00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:40.400]  I sat there and I listened to them for about 20 minutes.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.984]  I sat on the floor beneath them, down in front of the table, because there was no seating.
[00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:49.769]  And I heard them basically talking about how they were going to manipulate things.
[00:11:50.775 --> 00:12:13.981]  And, uh, I even tried to record some of it, but it was just how they were buddies, and how dumb everybody was that they thought this took rights, and ha ha ha, and my editor agrees with you, ha ha ha, and of course Richard Opel at the Statesman has written these editorials about how wonderful it is, and how you're basically an orange-haired, purple-haired kook if you don't love giving your liberty up, because the Patriot Act's the next best thing to slice bread.
[00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:17.402]  But we have a record of this, two months ago.
[00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:22.783]  Ashcroft met with all the big editors of the country.
[00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:26.584]  Hundreds of editors of big newspapers met in a big Hollywood hotel.
[00:12:27.504 --> 00:12:31.645]  They had members of the media, TV, magazine heads.
[00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:35.766]  I mean, there were just hundreds of news editors, it said, and hundreds of other executives.
[00:12:36.206 --> 00:12:38.927]  And Ashcroft said, please put a good face on the Patriot Act.
[00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:44.459]  Now you see sitcoms and dramas and the newspapers and the news broadcasts.
[00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:46.521]  It's all Patriot Act good, Patriot Act good.
[00:12:46.922 --> 00:12:48.624]  It's been represented unfairly.
[00:12:48.844 --> 00:12:50.065]  And that's what Ashcroft said.
[00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:51.366]  This meeting, the press reported on it.
[00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:54.430]  He said it's been unfairly misrepresented.
[00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.292]  Please help us get the truth out to the people.
[00:12:57.632 --> 00:13:04.838]  And so every day since then I've watched dozens of editorials from all the big papers about, and it's all basically plagiarism.
[00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:05.879]  It's all the same article.
[00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:12.604]  It's wonderful, it's good, people are lying, it doesn't affect citizens, you gotta have a judge's order, this isn't true.
[00:13:12.624 --> 00:13:25.095]  And I watch the news, especially print media, sit there in just an endless love-fest with the assistant U.S.
[00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:25.455]  attorney.
[00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:29.775]  And you know, to them it would just be, oh we're just friends, we're just friendly.
[00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:44.645]  But to me it was all, oh yeah buddy, oh off the record, oh sure I understand, yeah these people are... And I tried to talk to the reporter, the statesman reporter, one of them, I said, look buddy, ask him about Section 802, that this affects all citizens, all crimes.
[00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:48.067]  And the reporter started laughing at me, and the U.S.
[00:13:48.107 --> 00:13:49.268]  Attorney said, well,
[00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:52.470]  What's the problem, Mr. Jones?
[00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.910]  So what?
[00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.771]  We're going after criminals.
[00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:54.872]  You got a problem with that?
[00:13:55.232 --> 00:13:57.814]  I said, yeah, everybody deserves the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:13:58.014 --> 00:14:01.077]  These are people you think may be criminals, and I don't trust this government.
[00:14:01.097 --> 00:14:09.203]  And I made that point, and the statesman reporter was literally on a power trip just laughing at me, sitting there beside him.
[00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:12.036]  Ever seen Return of the Jedi?
[00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:12.917]  This is an analogy.
[00:14:13.217 --> 00:14:15.560]  That little creature that sits on Jabba the Hutt's shoulder?
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:22.286]  I mean, he was like that in some other states when Ryder was sitting there laughing at me.
[00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:25.709]  I'm going, what about Section 501 of Patriot Act 2?
[00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:30.053]  You know, for secret arrests and executions, stripping us of our citizenship, enemy combatant designation.
[00:14:30.413 --> 00:14:32.695]  Well, what's wrong with that if I care, hmm?
[00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:34.376]  Then I watched the Assistant U.S.
[00:14:34.396 --> 00:14:35.858]  Attorney go out and talk to the press.
[00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:37.217]  We're good to go.
[00:14:57.378 --> 00:14:59.300]  But understand the history of this.
[00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:05.047]  And when I got up and spoke, I talked about how it was staged with the newspapers and how Ashcroft had ordered his U.S.
[00:15:05.087 --> 00:15:07.409]  attorneys and their minions to go out and propagandize.
[00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:14.297]  And how he wasn't having open debates with the public, he was having staged events with the police and the military.
[00:15:15.991 --> 00:15:23.057]  And I went into how in Tulea, Texas, they framed 56 people knowing that they didn't have any drugs or paraphernalia.
[00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:24.298]  They just wanted to put them in prison.
[00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:28.841]  How Houston, Texas admits that they framed thousands of people with their crime lab.
[00:15:29.102 --> 00:15:34.286]  Talked about Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, former head of the FBI crime lab, who admits they were in there framing hundreds of people.
[00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:36.027]  And he finally blew the whistle on it.
[00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:38.029]  And I went over this and I said, see?
[00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.270]  You can't trust government.
[00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.551]  You've got to restrict its size.
[00:15:42.426 --> 00:15:46.109]  And then I broke down that, hey, John Ashcroft said there was no Patriot Act II.
[00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:47.230]  I know you guys remember that.
[00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:49.653]  And the Council was all nodding their heads.
[00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:53.376]  I said, well, now you hear him saying there is a Patriot Act II and we've got to pass it.
[00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:54.737]  These guys are liars!
[00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:56.579]  And I pointed at the Assistant U.S.
[00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:58.460]  Attorney and I said, they are liars!
[00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:01.203]  They are trying to foist this tyranny upon us.
[00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:04.626]  And there's a giant uproar of applause throughout this.
[00:16:08.183 --> 00:16:11.324]  They're counting on people not reading it, not knowing what's in it.
[00:16:11.424 --> 00:16:23.690]  But the incredible thing is, the statesman writers that were there didn't want to hear what I had to say, didn't want to quote what the people there speaking out were saying.
[00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.430]  It was all what the Assistant U.S.
[00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.331]  Attorney has to say.
[00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.912]  And it's all what Richard Opel, the editor, has to say.
[00:16:28.932 --> 00:16:33.674]  You know, the big liberal Democrat, defending Bush, defending the big globalist agenda.
[00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:38.423]  So, I mean, this is collusion, folks.
[00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:39.424]  This is massive.
[00:16:39.984 --> 00:16:41.244]  This is widespread.
[00:16:43.726 --> 00:16:47.567]  Now, let me just read some of this article, then we'll come back and we'll go to all these great callers.
[00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:51.689]  Criticism of Patriot Measure Endorsed.
[00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:52.310]  Okay.
[00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.011]  City resolution also opposes passage of USA Patriot Act.
[00:16:56.091 --> 00:16:57.752]  This is one of the statement writers that was there.
[00:16:58.292 --> 00:16:59.333]  One of the court gestures.
[00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:01.256]  Jonathan Osborne.
[00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:02.878]  He thinks it's real funny, folks.
[00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:10.686]  The Austin City Council, and again, he was literally... I mean, he was one step away from sitting in the Deputy U.S.
[00:17:10.726 --> 00:17:11.767]  Attorney's lap, okay?
[00:17:11.787 --> 00:17:14.290]  I mean, he was literally fawning on him.
[00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.131]  It was a love fest.
[00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:16.012]  It was disgusting.
[00:17:16.412 --> 00:17:18.634]  I thought he was a used car salesman trying to sell the U.S.
[00:17:18.674 --> 00:17:19.395]  Attorney on something.
[00:17:20.296 --> 00:17:23.119]  The Austin City Council officially put its writing
[00:17:23.937 --> 00:17:34.420]  In writing, it's criticism of the USA Patriot Act on Thursday, joining the more than 170 cities, Trump 400, and counties nationwide that have passed similar resolutions.
[00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:44.686]  Council Members Jackie Goodman, Daryl Slusher, Danny Thomas, Ruel Alvarez voted for the resolution which also opposed the passage of the USA Patriot Act II.
[00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:51.673]  Mayor Will Nguyen and Council Members Brewster McCracken and Betty Dunkerley abstained.
[00:17:51.773 --> 00:17:54.696]  I told them, I said, be part of history, don't abstain.
[00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.558]  Say yes or no.
[00:17:57.539 --> 00:17:58.981]  Of course, they did the cowardly thing.
[00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:01.181]  Very cynical folks.
[00:18:01.382 --> 00:18:12.965]  The Austin Resolution expressed concern that the Patriot Act, lauded by federal lawmakers as an essential tool in fighting terrorism, might have the potential of violating fundamental liberties.
[00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:25.310]  The resolution, sponsored by Goodman, Thomas, and Alvarez, stopped short of directing police not to cooperate with federal authorities, and as Slusher requested, it does not declare any parts of the act unconstitutional.
[00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.791]  Yeah, they had that changed, by the way, after I left at about 1130 at night.
[00:18:30.822 --> 00:18:38.389]  They just moved in and said, well, you'll have to follow the Bill of Rights Constitution and can't follow any unconstitutional orders, and you have to check with the city first.
[00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.191]  And that's better than nothing, folks.
[00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:42.933]  The point is that we forced them to do this, they didn't want to.
[00:18:44.575 --> 00:18:49.900]  And it goes on, the act was approved by Congress shortly after September 11th terrorist attacks.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.602]  It gives the government surveillance powers.
[00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:54.945]  The critics say it could lead to the infringement of citizens' civil rights.
[00:18:56.333 --> 00:19:03.139]  And by the way, their argument was, well, our police can be charged criminally if they don't follow federal mandates.
[00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:03.659]  Oh, really?
[00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:10.264]  Is that why the city doesn't help the feds arrest illegal aliens, even when they commit crimes?
[00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:12.726]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:16.088]  And it's the old Nuremberg defense, well, just following orders.
[00:19:17.069 --> 00:19:20.752]  If you're given an illegal order, you will still be held accountable for following that order.
[00:19:22.253 --> 00:19:23.434]  So this is what they tried to sell.
[00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.456]  And they had, in all fairness to the
[00:19:26.576 --> 00:19:28.137]  to the council.
[00:19:28.578 --> 00:19:31.500]  I mean, they basically have the city attorneys and their minions up there threatening.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.205]  I mean, they were twisting arms, shaking their heads when the councilors started talking, freaking out.
[00:19:37.866 --> 00:19:38.926]  The deputy U.S.
[00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:41.969]  attorney was running around behind the scenes, pulling his hair out.
[00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.191]  It was disgusting.
[00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:50.176]  But he did celebrate later when he got part of it gutted.
[00:19:52.777 --> 00:20:08.981]  Alright folks, we will come back and I'll take some more calls, we'll get to some calls, and then I'll get back into this Patriot Act, back into more gun control out of Congress, and the neocons telling McClintock to step down and so Arnold can be the governor.

[00:24:15.012 --> 00:24:20.215]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:26.999]  Alright, we're about to go straight to your calls and get to a ton of other vital news and info.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:35.964]  Just to try to encapsulate it, to watch the newspaper in the hip pocket of the federal government.
[00:24:36.661 --> 00:24:52.721]  To know that the editor has met with the Justice Department, to know that their reporters were there to fawn and manipulate, to fawn after the government and to manufacture consent
[00:24:53.746 --> 00:24:56.147]  It's really disturbing, and to watch the Deputy U.S.
[00:24:56.187 --> 00:25:10.033]  Attorney get in there and have the resolution changed slightly to where, well, the police aren't ordered to not help the feds in terrorism cases, but they've got to at least check with the city council or with the police chief.
[00:25:11.204 --> 00:25:13.505]  Point is, is that they're responding.
[00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:16.847]  Another city has said, no, we're concerned about this.
[00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:18.688]  They're not getting away with it.
[00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:19.569]  They're in trouble.
[00:25:19.989 --> 00:25:24.531]  More cities are passing it now that Ashcroft is gallivanting around lying.
[00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:31.955]  But this is a great example of the manipulation, the manipulation of our media by the government.
[00:25:32.436 --> 00:25:35.417]  All right, let's go to Miles in North Carolina.
[00:25:35.457 --> 00:25:36.218]  Go ahead, Miles.
[00:25:36.238 --> 00:25:37.618]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[00:25:37.638 --> 00:25:38.999]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:25:39.139 --> 00:25:39.459]  You bet.
[00:25:41.065 --> 00:25:45.329]  Uh, you was wondering if, uh, who's going to win the 2004 presidential election.
[00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:46.630]  I believe it's going to be George Bush.
[00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.013]  The reason why I say that is, is what do the Democrats have?
[00:25:51.234 --> 00:25:51.934]  Nobody really.
[00:25:52.014 --> 00:25:55.077]  So, I mean, people want to stick with Bush, you know?
[00:25:55.357 --> 00:26:01.642]  I mean, I know- Plus, they've got the, uh, Diebold electronic voting machines with the CIA running them.
[00:26:02.022 --> 00:26:08.628]  This has all come out in the news, but not on national news, and they got backdoors into all these touchscreen systems, so, um, hey!
[00:26:10.157 --> 00:26:20.004]  I don't think it matters who they put, a Wesley Clark, or a John Kerry, or George Bush, it's all skull and bones, or Rhodes Collar, it's all New World Order this, New World Order that, they're just figureheads.
[00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:34.575]  Yeah, well what I was thinking was whoever the Democrat nominee was would probably get Hillary as, you know, Vice President, that way they could say, well, you know,
[00:26:35.776 --> 00:26:47.639]  She didn't say she'd run for president, but she was chosen for vice president, you know, and then that way they'd give Bill Clinton a seat in the Senate and take her spot for whatever, how long, about a year I guess.
[00:26:48.979 --> 00:27:02.008]  No, I mean, that's good political analysis, and that would make great dog and pony show as, you know, they'd have fake fights between Clinton and Bush, as if Bush is the conservative, as if she's the liberal, and really they're business partners, going back to MENA.
[00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:09.674]  They could just have this big staged event, and imagine, imagine the thinking process being switched off if Hillary is involved in a presidential run.
[00:27:09.714 --> 00:27:14.897]  It'll be, I don't care if Bush takes my guns, I love him, I don't like Hillary!
[00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:16.519]  You know what's really scary is,
[00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:37.402]  I mean, I believe the reason why people are in the shape they're in now is because for years all you've heard is, you know, the rapture of the church and then, you know, so people get the attitude like, well, you know, hey, this stuff's going to happen.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.042]  After I'm taken out of here, you know, so they're like, they don't care.
[00:27:41.262 --> 00:27:44.724]  So I guess Christians didn't need to fight Stalin or Mao or Hitler.
[00:27:45.284 --> 00:27:48.026]  Or I guess the disciples were wrong because they were going to get raptured.
[00:27:48.046 --> 00:27:49.827]  They were wrong to go out and fight evil.
[00:27:50.667 --> 00:27:52.128]  Oh yeah, it's a great cop-out.
[00:27:52.168 --> 00:27:53.389]  Everybody just sit there.
[00:27:53.729 --> 00:27:55.830]  Oh, praise the Lord, they're going to put migrants in.
[00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.552]  That's what I've heard people say, you know.
[00:27:59.198 --> 00:28:01.859]  I mean, not what you said, but... Well, no, I've heard them.
[00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:02.299]  I've heard them.
[00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:03.380]  Oh, goody, goody, goody.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.360]  They're going to put microchips in us soon.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.661]  That means the end is near.
[00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.222]  Oh, this is great.
[00:28:09.282 --> 00:28:10.122]  It's truly sick.
[00:28:10.282 --> 00:28:24.448]  Then what are they going to do when they have a man comes out on the world scene and he claims to be, you know, Jesus Christ and people are just like... Well, that's what the Antichrist does and they're going to say that's Jesus and worship him and say Jesus is fighting the terrorists.
[00:28:25.311 --> 00:28:44.416]  Yeah, well, the thing I looked at is that people like that, you know, I mean, nobody's really met anybody that had charisma, and nobody's really seen any miracles done, you know, like people being raised up, like blind eyes being opened.
[00:28:44.436 --> 00:28:53.499]  I mean, I know it's happened, you know, where Christians have prayed for people and, you know, given God the glory.
[00:28:56.378 --> 00:28:59.060]  Well, see, the New World Order has its artificial miracles.
[00:29:02.222 --> 00:29:03.442]  With their super technology.
[00:29:03.482 --> 00:29:04.423]  Thanks for the call, Miles.
[00:29:05.163 --> 00:29:09.906]  Look, bottom line, bottom line, and I appreciate your call, Miles.
[00:29:09.966 --> 00:29:10.367]  Take care.
[00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:19.952]  Look, folks, bottom line here, whether you're an atheist or not, the world leaders are occultists, okay?
[00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:20.833]  Just go study it.
[00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.894]  Now, even if you don't believe in God, doesn't that show they're pretty whacked out that they believe in the devil?
[00:29:26.734 --> 00:29:29.257]  Even if the devil's not real, which I believe it is, I know it is.
[00:29:29.957 --> 00:29:33.500]  The point is, you can't deny that this world government is a cult.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.402]  Why is it attacking true Christianity?
[00:29:35.782 --> 00:29:36.082]  Why?
[00:29:36.262 --> 00:29:37.904]  That's an important point you've got to face.
[00:29:39.265 --> 00:29:42.948]  And we need to think about that and be conscious of that.
[00:29:43.729 --> 00:29:45.751]  And then look at all the developments on the world scene.
[00:29:46.591 --> 00:29:47.252]  Very interesting.
[00:29:49.008 --> 00:29:58.618]  All right, we're going to talk to Walt and Laura and Ron and Bob and others, and we've got the big cloning doctor who's got the clones on the way coming on the show later in the next hour.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.841]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:03.903]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.923 --> 00:30:07.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.921]  Hi, my name is Donald from TheGoldenAnswer.com.
[00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:15.401]  Everyone knows that they need to own gold and silver.
[00:30:15.622 --> 00:30:16.942]  You see the headlines every day.
[00:30:17.202 --> 00:30:19.563]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:20.983]  Many of you want to acquire...
[00:30:34.025 --> 00:30:40.068]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:43.690]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:47.932 --> 00:30:54.216]  Alright, my friends, we're already 33 minutes into the first hour of this worldwide transmission.
[00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:58.318]  Websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:14.872]  And I've got into the fact that here in Austin, Texas, last night, the City Council passed a pretty good resolution reaffirming the Bill of Rights and Constitution, reaffirming the first ten amendments of the Constitution, saying that the Patriot Act violates those and that the city will not violate those.
[00:31:16.652 --> 00:31:17.653]  And there was an assistant U.S.
[00:31:17.693 --> 00:31:21.114]  attorney, again, scurrying around, trying to stop all this from happening.
[00:31:21.874 --> 00:31:24.115]  And I watched the Austin American statesman
[00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:26.313]  Almost sitting in his lap.
[00:31:26.353 --> 00:31:29.076]  I mean, both reporters were sitting right up against him.
[00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:30.918]  They were in rapture together.
[00:31:30.958 --> 00:31:32.960]  They were giggling and laughing at the speakers.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.381]  It was so funny.
[00:31:34.521 --> 00:31:37.064]  I tried to talk to the reporters, give them some facts.
[00:31:37.204 --> 00:31:37.764]  They didn't care.
[00:31:37.824 --> 00:31:38.565]  It was cynical.
[00:31:38.965 --> 00:31:40.187]  They were on a power trip.
[00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:42.509]  And they knew exactly what they were there to do.
[00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:46.152]  And the poor saps reading the paper don't know that.
[00:31:46.192 --> 00:31:50.056]  They don't know that all the big editors met with Ashcroft two months ago in Hollywood.
[00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:52.107]  They don't know this is all staged.
[00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:56.229]  But, again, regardless of that, more and more people are waking up.
[00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.593]  This is tyrannical, and it doesn't matter if Ashcroft's on his roadshow, it's blowing up in their face.
[00:32:03.234 --> 00:32:05.515]  Coming up, Senators unite behind gun bill.
[00:32:05.635 --> 00:32:07.636]  Oh yes, new draconian gun law.
[00:32:08.837 --> 00:32:11.819]  The so-called conservatives want McClintock to step down.
[00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:12.759]  They want Arnold.
[00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:13.920]  That's their type of Republican.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.861]  The Republican leadership of the U.S.
[00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:16.762]  and of California.
[00:32:17.382 --> 00:32:18.503]  They don't want McClintock.
[00:32:19.744 --> 00:32:21.105]  They want Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:32:23.145 --> 00:32:25.726]  So, what a great example of America, folks.
[00:32:25.786 --> 00:32:26.527]  Isn't that nice?
[00:32:26.887 --> 00:32:27.767]  Isn't that nice?
[00:32:29.128 --> 00:32:31.849]  Be a good Bush-onian conservative.
[00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:37.851]  You've got to be involved with Nazis or Robert Mapplethorpe or say you want to be a dictator, I guess.
[00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:42.513]  And also, property rises, income down, census says.
[00:32:43.702 --> 00:32:47.385]  We'll get into that and a whole lot more.
[00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:50.727]  Right now, let's go to Walt in Michigan.
[00:32:50.787 --> 00:32:51.748]  Walt, go ahead, sir.
[00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:52.729]  Hello, Alex.
[00:32:53.089 --> 00:32:53.329]  Yes.
[00:32:54.029 --> 00:33:04.357]  About an hour and a half ago, I saw three armored personnel carriers, the large ones with the door that's open in the back, go down M-90 into Thumb on civilian transport.
[00:33:04.557 --> 00:33:05.037]  Go boys.
[00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:10.021]  Well, yeah, I mean, most police departments have multiple APCs.
[00:33:10.601 --> 00:33:11.822]  These were not civilian type.
[00:33:12.284 --> 00:33:13.785]  These are the large military type.
[00:33:14.065 --> 00:33:15.766]  Yeah, well, there are a lot of them moving around the country.
[00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:17.547]  They're manufacturing them in Canada.
[00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:18.808]  I think the U.S.
[00:33:18.908 --> 00:33:20.288]  Army, what, ordered 15,000 of them?
[00:33:20.329 --> 00:33:27.893]  These are heading toward M-25 along the coast and the Blue Water Bridge.
[00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:28.833]  Okay.
[00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:29.614]  That area.
[00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.495]  I don't know where they were going.
[00:33:31.515 --> 00:33:37.018]  Yeah, I got the BBC here from Monday where Eastern Bloc, you know,
[00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:42.082]  Ukrainian and others are out there pulling families out of their cars in Scotland.
[00:33:42.582 --> 00:33:43.703]  It's happened here in Texas.
[00:33:43.783 --> 00:33:46.523]  I mean, we have urban warfare where they take over cities.
[00:33:46.643 --> 00:33:48.564]  It's all part of desensitization.
[00:33:49.184 --> 00:33:57.847]  Well, I had a National Guard communications officer, propagandist, whatever, for the Guard.
[00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:01.388]  She trained with Latvians up at Camp Grayling.
[00:34:04.394 --> 00:34:06.435]  For Texas, it's Czech Republic, into Louisiana.
[00:34:30.827 --> 00:34:44.317]  It's Chinese for the areas of the West Coast, Latvians and Russians for the East Coast into Michigan, and Germans and Israelis for the Midwest.
[00:34:44.797 --> 00:34:45.618]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:34:45.638 --> 00:34:46.878]  This is the official map.
[00:34:46.898 --> 00:34:49.240]  There's official Army maps.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.782]  And again, the Army War College.
[00:34:53.237 --> 00:34:59.239]  In 1999 they said, quote, we want Mexican and Canadian troops in America to, quote, deal with American terrorism for peacekeeping.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:07.382]  And now they've signed the deals last year with a joint command for NORTHCOM, and they've signed deals to bring foreign troops into America.
[00:35:07.782 --> 00:35:15.965]  Well, they're using those APCs, exactly the same kind I saw over in Iraq and these other countries where they're going door-to-door to confiscate civilians' firearms.
[00:35:16.025 --> 00:35:18.226]  These are large, what, Marine Corps-type LAVs?
[00:35:18.246 --> 00:35:19.006]  They're large.
[00:35:19.046 --> 00:35:20.907]  I don't know the model.
[00:35:22.263 --> 00:35:25.344]  I know they had the door in the back.
[00:35:26.304 --> 00:35:27.405]  That's one of those warriors.
[00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:31.365]  Just like the ones they're using in Iraq, they've been putting in the papers.
[00:35:31.886 --> 00:35:32.246]  Sure.
[00:35:32.366 --> 00:35:32.766]  On the news.
[00:35:33.366 --> 00:35:33.686]  Yeah.
[00:35:35.026 --> 00:35:36.587]  That was about an hour and a half ago.
[00:35:36.827 --> 00:35:37.247]  Okay.
[00:35:37.787 --> 00:35:38.967]  Well, thank you for that call.
[00:35:38.987 --> 00:35:39.728]  Appreciate it, Walt.
[00:35:40.508 --> 00:35:42.048]  Let's talk to Laura in Alabama.
[00:35:42.088 --> 00:35:42.928]  Laura, you're on the air.
[00:35:42.988 --> 00:35:43.388]  Go ahead.
[00:35:44.129 --> 00:35:44.309]  Yes.
[00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:48.290]  I'd like to make two different comments, and then I'll hang up and let you talk.
[00:35:49.986 --> 00:35:55.834]  First of all, the cities are waking up to the Patriot Bill, and they don't want it.
[00:35:55.935 --> 00:35:57.457]  So that means the global elite...
[00:35:58.844 --> 00:36:03.027]  Uh... are probably going to pull something to keep their plans afloat.
[00:36:03.047 --> 00:36:06.530]  Well, let me... and you can continue, but this is a good point you're making.
[00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:17.597]  What they'll do is, hold on, they'll let the Patriot Act resistance build, they'll let the resistance of the war build, then blow stuff up and say, oh see, we canceled total information awareness.
[00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:20.859]  Oh see, he threw out the Patriot Act and look what you caused.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.420]  I do see that in the cards.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.501]  I've been saying that for a year.
[00:36:23.561 --> 00:36:23.961]  Go ahead.
[00:36:24.242 --> 00:36:26.103]  Yeah, that's that Hegelian dialectic.
[00:36:26.443 --> 00:36:28.504]  They use in every country when they take them over.
[00:36:29.025 --> 00:36:36.750]  But I think that the Rockefellers and the Hagues and the Schultzes and some of these folks are getting pretty old and they want to see this come to fruition.
[00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.031]  Oh, very astute.
[00:36:39.051 --> 00:36:40.932]  Another bombshell statement.
[00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:41.633]  Absolutely.
[00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:52.340]  And another unrelated comment is I'm glad that Congress passed that do not call list because I think people have a right to opt out of phone calls just like they do junk mail.
[00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:56.257]  Okay, let me elaborate because I'm glad you called in about this.
[00:36:56.457 --> 00:36:57.858]  Okay, I'll hang up then and let you talk.
[00:36:57.898 --> 00:36:59.259]  Well, no, I want to get your take on this.
[00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:00.420]  Will you stay there, Laura?
[00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:02.081]  She already gone?
[00:37:03.302 --> 00:37:04.242]  Okay, she wanted to get off.
[00:37:04.262 --> 00:37:09.046]  Well, I threw this out as a question to the listeners because I don't know where I stand on this.
[00:37:09.626 --> 00:37:15.590]  Normally, people like this show because, well, I know where I stand on about 99% of stuff, but I haven't really had time to think about it.
[00:37:16.551 --> 00:37:18.392]  And driving in my truck yesterday,
[00:37:19.914 --> 00:37:21.055]  Down to the City Council.
[00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:30.822]  I was listening to the news and it said, well, the Do Not Call List, a judge has blocked it, and so it'll be a couple months until the Do Not Call List goes in.
[00:37:30.842 --> 00:37:36.086]  And at my house, I mean, it's always on Sunday night, Saturday night, Monday night, Tuesday night.
[00:37:36.627 --> 00:37:38.508]  We probably get three or four of these calls a night.
[00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:39.709]  A lot of times it's the same people.
[00:37:40.209 --> 00:37:47.795]  AT&T, Sprint, Mortgage Company, Viagra, you know, peddling drug companies.
[00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:48.876]  I don't know how they can do that.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.842]  It's all distasteful and I'm sick of it.
[00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.143]  Let me just say that here.
[00:37:54.264 --> 00:37:56.766]  And this goes on and on and on.
[00:37:56.906 --> 00:37:57.787]  All these calls!
[00:37:59.809 --> 00:38:00.790]  But here's the problem.
[00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.774]  Do I like having the government involved in restricting who can call who?
[00:38:04.794 --> 00:38:10.759]  I mean, maybe there should be class action suits against people for doing this for harassment.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.684]  I guarantee you, if you have a couple hundred class action suits against people, they'll stop doing these.
[00:38:19.148 --> 00:38:20.869]  So, I don't know where I stand.
[00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.532]  Because, again, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:27.315]  It's paved with good intentions.
[00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:33.439]  And so the government always tells us, well, we need a camera in your car to make sure children don't burn up in the heat.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.163]  We need a retina scan you to start your car at the size of your tire.
[00:38:38.203 --> 00:38:40.245]  That was mainstream news yesterday, folks.
[00:38:40.725 --> 00:38:41.706]  Oninfullwords.com.
[00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:45.804]  Well, we need to have face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:38:45.844 --> 00:38:48.666]  Well, your cell phone needs a satellite tracker, Jip.
[00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:49.907]  It could save somebody.
[00:38:50.407 --> 00:38:53.069]  Then they admit the plan is to track and trace in Texas with it.
[00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:54.109]  By the mile.
[00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:57.692]  Using it as a road marker off the RFID readers on the highways.
[00:38:59.032 --> 00:38:59.493]  All of this.
[00:38:59.633 --> 00:39:01.714]  Oh, we've got to take our liberties for security.
[00:39:01.754 --> 00:39:05.456]  You know, it's this... But you look at who creates the crisis over and over again.
[00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:06.117]  It's this government.
[00:39:06.857 --> 00:39:08.278]  I can't stand telemarketers.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:10.920]  But...
[00:39:12.026 --> 00:39:17.108]  You know this is going to get expanded out to you can't call anybody unless they solicited it up front.
[00:39:18.168 --> 00:39:19.589]  Unless they said you can call me.
[00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:22.950]  So it's pretty scary.
[00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:28.452]  Also, the government can selectively enforce this and claim you called somebody you weren't supposed to.
[00:39:28.972 --> 00:39:29.292]  I don't know.
[00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:30.633]  There's just problems involved.
[00:39:32.754 --> 00:39:34.694]  Anything federal scares me.
[00:39:34.754 --> 00:39:41.697]  I mean, if it was by a state-by-state basis and states would prosecute people, I don't think I'd have a problem with that because I can't stand telemarketers.
[00:39:42.526 --> 00:39:50.168]  But seriously, I mean, there's drug companies, mortgage companies, phone companies, people trying to sell you magazine subscriptions.
[00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:56.910]  And once you get on these lists, I mean, the phone just rings and rings and rings.
[00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.471]  And before we changed our number, by the way, we had to change our number.
[00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:07.572]  The phone, not just from listeners and people who'd gotten our home phone number, but everybody, these telemarketers, just ring, ring, ring.
[00:40:08.093 --> 00:40:09.433]  It's the same thing with spam.
[00:40:11.357 --> 00:40:13.058]  Everybody walks up to me in person.
[00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:17.379]  I mean, I've had, like, Hollywood people that are trying to get in touch with me who see me on the street who live here in Austin.
[00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:19.120]  Alex, I tried to email you five times.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:19.960]  It bounces back.
[00:40:20.661 --> 00:40:23.382]  Or newspaper reporters, or everybody!
[00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:27.523]  It bounces back, and what am I supposed to do?
[00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:34.006]  Well, the reason that's happening is we're getting now several thousand or more emails a day.
[00:40:34.106 --> 00:40:34.866]  Here's the problem, though.
[00:40:35.426 --> 00:40:36.166]  There'll be 300, 400 good emails in there.
[00:40:38.314 --> 00:40:42.156]  The rest of it, and I got like eight email addresses or something, it's all spam.
[00:40:44.197 --> 00:40:45.538]  Hundreds of drug ads.
[00:40:46.078 --> 00:40:48.259]  Hundreds of mortgage ads.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.542]  Hundreds of those scam emails from Nigeria going, I am the Crown Prince.
[00:40:52.942 --> 00:40:55.743]  You'll sue me $5,000, I will wire you $15 million, you know.
[00:40:58.845 --> 00:41:00.906]  I'm sick of it, but do I want the government involved?
[00:41:00.926 --> 00:41:05.048]  They're trying to pass laws where if you send somebody an unsolicited email, you get jail time.
[00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:07.790]  And you know that's going to be selectively enforced.
[00:41:09.048 --> 00:41:12.491]  They got laws where sending somebody an unsolicited email will be considered hacking!
[00:41:14.232 --> 00:41:17.095]  Orrin Hatch will destroy your computer if you download anything.
[00:41:17.896 --> 00:41:19.577]  This is serious business, folks.
[00:41:19.897 --> 00:41:20.878]  I don't know how to handle it.
[00:41:20.918 --> 00:41:21.819]  What do you think we should do?
[00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:23.400]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.104]  Alright, Ron in New York.
[00:41:28.124 --> 00:41:29.826]  Go ahead, Ron, then Bob in Wyoming and others.
[00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:30.887]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:32.308]  I called up about that gun bill.
[00:41:32.328 --> 00:41:34.650]  I've done some extensive research on it all morning.
[00:41:35.672 --> 00:41:42.357]  Um, what it is, is the resurrection or reincarnation of the Our Lady of Peace Act, which I know you're familiar with.
[00:41:42.397 --> 00:41:43.978]  You've had Larry Pratt on your airwave.
[00:41:44.098 --> 00:41:45.500]  And it's also in S-22.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.222]  It is the total registration of all gun owners and a bunch of other trash.
[00:41:49.523 --> 00:41:51.264]  And of course, it's got a Republican pushing it.
[00:41:51.504 --> 00:41:53.486]  And Bush says he'll sign it, tell folks all about it.
[00:41:53.626 --> 00:41:54.146]  I will.
[00:41:54.486 --> 00:41:55.647]  I'll give you all the details.
[00:41:56.248 --> 00:41:59.510]  The fact is, it's the resurrection of the Our Lady of Peace Act.
[00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.353]  However, it's the same thing, but they put a new title on the bill.
[00:42:04.068 --> 00:42:09.310]  It's called the National Criminal Background Check Act of 2003.
[00:42:10.271 --> 00:42:19.594]  Now, the bill, one of its main sponsors, one of the main people pushing it is the Senator from New York, Charles Schumer, who I'm sure is known to much of your audience.
[00:42:20.134 --> 00:42:25.237]  But ironically enough... We call him, uh, we call him the Dirty Possum.
[00:42:25.717 --> 00:42:31.279]  Okay, well, ironically enough, Senator Schumer, the Dirty Possum, look at the Trojan horses he's working with and doing this.
[00:42:32.253 --> 00:42:32.813]  In the U.S.
[00:42:32.833 --> 00:42:36.374]  House of Representatives, John Dingell, who postures himself as pro-gun.
[00:42:36.935 --> 00:42:37.535]  In the U.S.
[00:42:37.575 --> 00:42:39.095]  Senate... Ah, John Dingell!
[00:42:40.116 --> 00:42:40.656]  In the U.S.
[00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:50.219]  Senate, men who posture themselves as real apple pie conservatives in the Judiciary Committee, John McCain, Orrin Hatch, and Larry Craig.
[00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:50.919]  U.S.
[00:42:50.939 --> 00:42:53.860]  Senators, all Republicans, all men who posture themselves as pro-gun.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.401]  And by the way, it talks about the NRA's neutral on this.
[00:42:56.521 --> 00:42:58.262]  No, no, no, they're not neutral on it anymore.
[00:42:58.786 --> 00:43:02.287]  The NRA has gone through various metamorphosis with this.
[00:43:02.567 --> 00:43:05.768]  Yeah, well, I've got an article from today saying they were neutral.
[00:43:05.788 --> 00:43:07.269]  You're saying that just changed them a year.
[00:43:07.449 --> 00:43:08.929]  Yeah, listen, let me give you the background on this.
[00:43:08.949 --> 00:43:11.530]  I've been on top of this like white on rice from day one.
[00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.071]  I know, Ron.
[00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:13.431]  You called about a month ago about this.
[00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:13.811]  Okay.
[00:43:14.371 --> 00:43:15.612]  Originally, they supported it.
[00:43:15.792 --> 00:43:16.592]  They caught hell.
[00:43:17.112 --> 00:43:17.332]  Okay?
[00:43:17.352 --> 00:43:19.153]  There was a second incarnation of this bill.
[00:43:19.493 --> 00:43:20.893]  Then they took the neutral posture.
[00:43:21.514 --> 00:43:28.236]  Now that this is the third incarnation of this bill under a new title, but it's the same package, the same goods, they're in favor of it.
[00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:30.840]  Now, that's another... Now, are you a liberal?
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:31.801]  Excuse me?
[00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:33.242]  Well, you're pro-gun.
[00:43:34.142 --> 00:43:35.323]  Are you a member of the Communist Party?
[00:43:35.823 --> 00:43:37.784]  No, what I am is... No, no, let me stop you.
[00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:38.025]  Hey!
[00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:38.565]  Hey!
[00:43:39.485 --> 00:43:42.167]  The veterans fought and died so we'd have our guns confiscated.
[00:43:42.567 --> 00:43:47.650]  Well, I know that... Gun registration is conservative and you are obviously a communist.
[00:43:47.851 --> 00:43:48.511]  I knew that.
[00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:49.291]  I knew that.
[00:43:49.332 --> 00:43:53.574]  I believe it was Patrick Henry that did say, give me databases or give me death.
[00:43:53.734 --> 00:43:55.415]  Well, he was an evil commie.
[00:43:55.535 --> 00:43:56.276]  He was a commie.
[00:43:56.296 --> 00:43:57.136]  George Washington.
[00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.037]  Yeah, they were all commie.
[00:43:58.417 --> 00:43:59.037]  All of them.
[00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:08.621]  And again, Arnold, I mean, when you're involved with the most raunchy pornographer out there, and love Hitler, you're good.
[00:44:08.641 --> 00:44:15.464]  I mean, literally, folks, we're not even being sarcastic now, but if you love America, and love sovereignty and the Second Amendment, you are a Communist!
[00:44:15.724 --> 00:44:16.844]  Rice Limbaugh says it!
[00:44:17.365 --> 00:44:19.926]  Let me even impart some more information to the audience.
[00:44:20.546 --> 00:44:23.187]  They should definitely, and you have a lot of NRA members that listen to you,
[00:44:23.655 --> 00:44:25.796]  Get on your phone, raise hell with the NRA.
[00:44:26.016 --> 00:44:28.917]  Because, believe me, if they weren't supportive of this bill, it would go nowhere.
[00:44:29.017 --> 00:44:30.778]  I heard they were neutral.
[00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:32.838]  I believe you, Ron, because you've called them with good stuff in the past.
[00:44:33.298 --> 00:44:35.059]  Where did you hear them say they're now supporting it?
[00:44:35.099 --> 00:44:36.199]  This is larcenous!
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:43.702]  Okay, because this morning, I personally called their federal affairs office and spoke with their liaison.
[00:44:44.823 --> 00:44:46.103]  The federal affairs liaison.
[00:44:47.148 --> 00:44:48.009]  And they're supportive of it.
[00:44:48.149 --> 00:44:51.871]  I tell you, they're the most disgusting organization I've ever seen in my life.
[00:44:52.131 --> 00:44:54.993]  I'm a life member of that organization, and I say that with some regret.
[00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:57.335]  And it's time for people now to get on their case.
[00:44:57.395 --> 00:45:00.297]  Something strange has happened to that organization in the last 10 years.
[00:45:00.337 --> 00:45:04.099]  It has become insular and it's cynicistic towards the interests of its rank and file members.
[00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:05.080]  Well, it's called infiltration!
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.421]  You don't think they're going to just let us have our Second Amendment?
[00:45:08.342 --> 00:45:13.825]  Well, then I think the rank and file members, such as I have done, should get on the phone and tell them, don't you dare support this.
[00:45:13.845 --> 00:45:14.746]  You know what this bill does?
[00:45:15.678 --> 00:45:21.728]  It creates total registration and a nexus tied into the new matrix system and total information.
[00:45:22.009 --> 00:45:23.051]  And guess what else it does?
[00:45:23.644 --> 00:45:28.068]  It breaches the confidentiality of medical records, something we have held in violence.
[00:45:28.088 --> 00:45:32.632]  For those who don't know, folks, it's not just going to be now that you have a misdemeanor and can't own a gun.
[00:45:32.692 --> 00:45:36.715]  And the states, from Maryland to Kentucky, are going after folks who have misdemeanors.
[00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:40.598]  They're now considering that under the 60-Year Gun Control Act, expanding it to misdemeanors.
[00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:44.121]  Now, folks, it's medical records.
[00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:45.542]  They did a beta test of this in 1990.
[00:45:45.582 --> 00:45:47.504]  You're on the money with what you're saying.
[00:45:47.684 --> 00:45:48.364]  Well, let me stop you.
[00:45:49.265 --> 00:45:55.794]  Remember the beta test of this in 99 when Clinton gave 800,000 plus files on veterans for their medical records?
[00:45:56.255 --> 00:46:00.200]  And if somebody had ever collapsed in Vietnam from exhaustion, they consider that now mental illness?
[00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:05.107]  And so Grandpa goes in to buy his grandson a .22 and suddenly his red flag is a mental patient?
[00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:07.507]  That was the beta test!
[00:46:07.927 --> 00:46:09.568]  And so folks, you got a misdemeanor?
[00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:17.934]  You had an emotional breakdown when your wife died or something and checked yourself into the hospital over it?
[00:46:17.954 --> 00:46:20.555]  Because that's what the society said you should do?
[00:46:20.895 --> 00:46:22.316]  No guns for you now!
[00:46:22.596 --> 00:46:23.477]  No guns for you!
[00:46:23.557 --> 00:46:23.937]  Go ahead.
[00:46:24.498 --> 00:46:26.459]  And Alex, you couldn't be more accurate.
[00:46:26.499 --> 00:46:27.339]  And let me expand on that.
[00:46:27.399 --> 00:46:29.221]  It does include medical records, and you're right.
[00:46:29.261 --> 00:46:33.043]  And you know, one of the big stinks that Schumer and these other foreign conservatives are saying
[00:46:33.695 --> 00:46:43.944]  Is that well states don't report everything the reason that states do not report everything to federal databases is because the offenses committed are such low status offenses
[00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:51.428]  That, as you said, under the 1968 Gun Control Act, they don't rise to the level of the type of offense where you should lose civil rights.
[00:46:51.848 --> 00:47:04.592]  Now they want to take, literally, that sort of jaywalking offense... Look, we've had Larry Pratt on, we've read the analysis, I've read the bill on air, Arlenia Peace, also in Patriot Act II and S-22, Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[00:47:05.172 --> 00:47:07.254]  And it says everything.
[00:47:07.394 --> 00:47:10.036]  Millions more Americans will be knocked off the gun rolls.
[00:47:10.596 --> 00:47:11.637]  And I told folks this.
[00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:16.661]  That's why I'm... Look, I believe the day somebody gets out of prison, give them a machine gun.
[00:47:17.082 --> 00:47:18.443]  And people go, oh, that's crazy.
[00:47:18.743 --> 00:47:26.749]  Folks, back when this country was free and your doors were open, they would give you your guns back if you were taken into custody ten years before for bank robbery.
[00:47:26.909 --> 00:47:28.711]  When you left, they'd give you your guns back.
[00:47:29.131 --> 00:47:31.913]  And that was back in the day and age when crime was actually much lower.
[00:47:31.973 --> 00:47:33.535]  Hollywood played it up like there was a bunch of crime.
[00:47:33.555 --> 00:47:33.995]  There wasn't.
[00:47:34.575 --> 00:47:39.962]  I'd rather have criminals out there with their guns than a corrupt government be able to restrict me having a gun.
[00:47:40.242 --> 00:47:48.832]  Criminals don't run around doing stuff in Texas like they do in New York because they know if they bust in somebody's house about 60% of the time they're going to get their head blown off.
[00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.193]  That's absolutely true.
[00:47:50.494 --> 00:47:54.038]  And another thing is, as I said, everybody who's within earshot of me speaking.
[00:47:54.588 --> 00:48:01.676]  You have to call up, you have to raise hell about this, because they've done this in a backroom deal, in a dark corner from out of left field.
[00:48:01.696 --> 00:48:02.357]  Hold on real quick, Ron.
[00:48:02.377 --> 00:48:06.902]  You called the NRA, what did the Trojan Horse, uh, Judas Iscariot, tell you?
[00:48:07.362 --> 00:48:15.872]  Well, they tried to sell me on the act, but I told them, listen, I have a copy of the legislation, and it's not what you're purporting that it is, and I told them verbatim what the legislation is, so I said,
[00:48:16.232 --> 00:48:17.414]  We shouldn't be involved in this.
[00:48:17.454 --> 00:48:21.380]  We shouldn't be involved in putting the Second Amendment into conflict with the Fourth Amendment.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.124]  We shouldn't be involved in depriving states of states' rights.
[00:48:24.144 --> 00:48:25.286]  And what did the Rodents tell you?
[00:48:26.147 --> 00:48:28.891]  Well, they were just, I'm sorry, you know, I differ in opinion with you.
[00:48:28.911 --> 00:48:29.532]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:29.552 --> 00:48:30.113]  Thank you for the call.
[00:48:31.483 --> 00:48:36.827]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:48:36.987 --> 00:48:45.194]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:48:45.454 --> 00:48:54.100]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:49:00.145]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:49:00.345 --> 00:49:05.526]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:14.628]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodine form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:49:14.908 --> 00:49:20.509]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:49:21.749 --> 00:49:21.989]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:49:30.832 --> 00:49:35.157]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:49:35.337 --> 00:49:39.782]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:49:39.922 --> 00:49:44.307]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:49:44.347 --> 00:49:45.668]  The New World Order.
[00:49:46.449 --> 00:49:47.370]  Can emerge.
[00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:51.672]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:49:51.752 --> 00:49:58.676]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:49:58.816 --> 00:50:00.857]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:50:01.197 --> 00:50:02.138]  Homeland Security.
[00:50:02.398 --> 00:50:11.622]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:50:11.822 --> 00:50:17.164]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.
[00:50:17.684 --> 00:50:20.905]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:20.945 --> 00:50:21.446]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:50:21.466 --> 00:50:22.746]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:50:30.464 --> 00:50:31.445]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:50:31.685 --> 00:50:34.006]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards?
[00:50:34.086 --> 00:50:34.826]  You heard that right.
[00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:37.368]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:50:37.528 --> 00:50:38.468]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:40.009]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:41.850]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:44.811]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:48.693]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[00:50:48.893 --> 00:50:50.294]  Almost no one has ever failed.
[00:50:50.454 --> 00:50:51.355]  Check out 1-2-3 Nodet.com
[00:50:54.056 --> 00:50:57.299]  You can also wipe out your mortgage debt and get a free and clear title.
[00:50:57.519 --> 00:51:00.321]  Mortgage elimination is usually completed in two or three months.
[00:51:00.581 --> 00:51:03.163]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[00:51:03.363 --> 00:51:07.786]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than 10 years.
[00:51:07.967 --> 00:51:09.348]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[00:51:09.628 --> 00:51:10.508]  Fight back America!
[00:51:10.629 --> 00:51:11.469]  Stop the fraud!
[00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:12.450]  Stop the rip-off!
[00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:13.711]  Learn the truth!
[00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:17.356]  1-2-3 Nodet.com.
[00:51:17.496 --> 00:51:22.945]  Come over and get our rock-solid technology that wipes out debt without bankruptcy.
[00:51:22.965 --> 00:51:24.807]  1-2-3 Nodet.com.
[00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:26.170]  Live debt-free now.
[00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.153]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[00:51:42.574 --> 00:51:43.795]  All right, we're back live.
[00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:46.656]  I knew the NRA had supported this bill.
[00:51:47.757 --> 00:51:53.721]  They sell it to all the fools out there as Project Exile at the state level.
[00:51:54.721 --> 00:52:00.805]  And then I knew under pressure they'd gone neutral and Ron saying that he called them and they're now for it.
[00:52:00.945 --> 00:52:02.746]  And I'm just so sick of this.
[00:52:04.019 --> 00:52:06.060]  Senators unite behind gun bill.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.501]  This is the Washington Times.
[00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:18.026]  A bill to improve the national database aimed at preventing felons and the mentally ill from purchasing guns was announced jointly yesterday by two senators, a Democrat and a Republican.
[00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:22.122]  Now notice, the mentally ill now, everything's mental illness.
[00:52:22.142 --> 00:52:25.943]  They have hundreds of new designations and your boss says, oh, you've been a little stressed out.
[00:52:26.263 --> 00:52:29.624]  Go to the counselor, and the counselor goes, oh, why don't you go see a shrink?
[00:52:30.224 --> 00:52:32.665]  Half the folks in our department are, and it's okay.
[00:52:33.165 --> 00:52:34.385]  Oh, alright, I guess I'll go.
[00:52:34.465 --> 00:52:35.305]  Sure, you're telling me to.
[00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.606]  Oh yeah, it's totally normal.
[00:52:36.846 --> 00:52:37.986]  Then of course you lose your rights.
[00:52:38.606 --> 00:52:42.667]  They can't get you on welfare, they can't get you into criminal justice, they'll get you into their mind control.
[00:52:43.948 --> 00:52:48.569]  Senator Charles E. Dirty Possum Schumer, New York Democrat,
[00:52:49.484 --> 00:53:05.029]  Mr. Schumer predicted it would be the first gun legislation to go through Congress in years, saying the backers on stage with him covered the entire spectrum of gun control positions.
[00:53:05.189 --> 00:53:06.650]  Isn't this incredible?
[00:53:08.631 --> 00:53:09.711]  Mr. Schumer predicted.
[00:53:10.928 --> 00:53:11.748]  That it will pass.
[00:53:11.808 --> 00:53:19.890]  The bill would provide $400 million in incentives and grants to help states provide better information on the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
[00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:28.813]  And again, it will be misdemeanors, your medical records, if you've ever seen a psychologist, they'll send me an investigation of you.
[00:53:30.513 --> 00:53:34.074]  No, we need no gun laws so I can protect myself from lunatics!
[00:53:36.195 --> 00:53:37.815]  And it goes on and on and
[00:53:39.298 --> 00:53:41.619]  Oh, it does admit that the NRA supports this.
[00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.440]  Well, isn't that nice?
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.020]  Again!
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:52.223]  Open borders, gun control, campaign finance, signing it, protecting Bill Clinton and Pardongate, doing all this horrible stuff.
[00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.044]  This is sick!
[00:53:55.164 --> 00:53:57.165]  This makes me so mad!
[00:53:57.945 --> 00:54:03.627]  Now, we got the big cloning scientist who's in the news, who's really got clones going.
[00:54:04.147 --> 00:54:05.388]  Not the quiet, but the real deal.
[00:54:06.081 --> 00:54:12.386]  Join us in about 35 minutes, and before we do that, we'll talk to Ron and Bob and a bunch of other folks that are holding.
[00:54:14.288 --> 00:54:18.211]  And I do have a bunch of other news I'm going to get to, but here's another example of being stabbed in the back.
[00:54:18.231 --> 00:54:20.693]  McClintock pressed to quit the race.
[00:54:21.474 --> 00:54:25.397]  Also on the Washington Times, and it says prominent Republicans say that they want Schwarzenegger.
[00:54:25.477 --> 00:54:26.618]  Get out of there, McClintock!
[00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.260]  You're pro-gun and pro-border.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.341]  We want you out of there.
[00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:30.841]  Again!
[00:54:30.861 --> 00:54:33.504]  McClintock, you're not communistic enough.
[00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:35.005]  Sorry, buddy.
[00:54:35.706 --> 00:54:37.227]  You've got a little too much substance.
[00:54:37.247 --> 00:54:41.531]  Well, it's like when Bush had Ron Paul targeted in his last re-election campaign.
[00:54:41.571 --> 00:54:45.354]  Or Bush has openly said he's targeting Tom D'Angrito, who just wants to control our borders.
[00:54:45.774 --> 00:54:49.337]  They targeted Senator Bob Smith and got John Sununu in there.
[00:54:49.617 --> 00:54:51.879]  He's starting to figure out what's going on.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:57.264]  Now do you realize why I can't stand the neocon talk show hosts that keep you in the dark?
[00:54:58.605 --> 00:55:02.468]  That I could just clobber if they'd come on this show and debate me, which of course they won't.
[00:55:04.028 --> 00:55:23.139]  Before I end this hour, if you believe in this show, what we're doing, and you want to wake folks up, and you want to support this broadcast, you need to get Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, those are just some of my great films, the new amazing book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order by Paul Watson that I've published.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.481]  Seriously folks, get Order Out of Chaos.
[00:55:27.168 --> 00:55:28.870]  Get 9-1-1 the Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:30.271]  Give them as gifts.
[00:55:30.712 --> 00:55:31.472]  Take action.
[00:55:31.512 --> 00:55:32.433]  Don't count on others.
[00:55:32.693 --> 00:55:36.437]  We can win this thing, but not if you don't get off the bench and get in the game.
[00:55:36.817 --> 00:55:38.279]  Call right now and get the videos.
[00:55:38.319 --> 00:55:38.919]  Get the books.
[00:55:38.939 --> 00:55:39.840]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.100]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:49.802 --> 00:55:52.664]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order.
[00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:56.687]  Do not wait, folks.
[00:55:56.707 --> 00:56:01.090]  888-253-3139 or infowars.com to order.
[00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:08.695]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:09.615 --> 00:56:11.657]  Please take action.
[00:56:12.157 --> 00:56:13.018]  Get the videos.
[00:56:13.318 --> 00:56:16.440]  You get three or more, they drop down substantially in price, by the way.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.422]  Second hour, a lot of news in your calls and a guest right ahead.
[00:56:21.514 --> 00:56:23.455]  Clean water, clean food, and clean air.
[00:56:23.675 --> 00:56:24.816]  It's what nature intended.
[00:56:25.036 --> 00:56:28.458]  The trouble today is that our nutrients have been stripped and polluted.
[00:56:28.638 --> 00:56:32.540]  That's why your friends at Nutriteam stock the best in water and air.
[00:56:35.301 --> 00:56:38.463]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.012 --> 00:56:47.652]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.313 --> 00:56:49.373]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.093 --> 00:56:51.194]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.854 --> 00:56:52.674]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.414 --> 00:56:54.335]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:58.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.177 --> 00:57:03.298]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.279 --> 00:57:07.500]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.282]  Already 30 seconds into the second hour of this Friday global transmission against tyranny.
[00:57:15.123 --> 00:57:17.748]  Let Ron finish up briefly, then Bob, H.W., Rudy.
[00:57:17.788 --> 00:57:20.993]  Is that Margo in New Mexico?
[00:57:22.435 --> 00:57:22.716]  Good.
[00:57:23.176 --> 00:57:23.657]  Thank you, Mark.
[00:57:25.149 --> 00:57:29.033]  And just a bunch of other news as the Republicans pressure McClintock to step down.
[00:57:29.053 --> 00:57:35.238]  They should tell Arnold, that degenerate Nazi porno man, to step down.
[00:57:35.298 --> 00:57:36.900]  That gun-grabbing piece of trash.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.843]  But no, Limbaugh and Hannity are all worshipping him because they're dirty folks.
[00:57:41.063 --> 00:57:41.964]  They're bad news.
[00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:49.231]  And the NRA, I actually did find an article here, is supporting total gun registration and banning people with misdemeanors from owning guns.
[00:57:50.274 --> 00:57:55.227]  And it's just incredible, and Ron in New York called him up as a live member and talked to him today, and they admitted this.
[00:57:55.247 --> 00:57:56.269]  They're very proud of themselves.
[00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:57.673]  Real quick, finish up, Ron.
[00:58:00.859 --> 00:58:02.500]  Okay, Ron, you going to finish up, buddy?
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.340]  Yes, yes I am.
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.322]  Like I said, it's called the National Criminal Background Check Act of 2003.
[00:58:08.362 --> 00:58:08.763]  Call up.
[00:58:09.303 --> 00:58:12.064]  Representatives said they're going to try and bum-rush this through.
[00:58:12.324 --> 00:58:18.027]  They're going to try and fast-track this legislation, because they know once we wake up about it, there may be a big public outcry.
[00:58:18.467 --> 00:58:22.169]  Everybody, like you said, get off the bench, get in the game, do it right away.
[00:58:22.189 --> 00:58:25.110]  Did you know the NRA lobbied for the 1968 Gun Control Act?
[00:58:25.723 --> 00:58:27.144]  I know that Charlton Heston did.
[00:58:27.564 --> 00:58:30.206]  Oh yeah, I'm really on TV, but that's my whole point.
[00:58:30.466 --> 00:58:34.389]  They're a Trojan horse, and they con the five million active gun owners.
[00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:37.811]  And that horse has gotten bigger in the last ten years than it's ever been.
[00:58:38.632 --> 00:58:41.994]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks, and we'd better get on the ball here.
[00:58:42.014 --> 00:58:42.774]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:43.035 --> 00:58:44.075]  You're welcome.
[00:58:44.175 --> 00:58:46.397]  Gun control's conservative, yes.
[00:58:47.377 --> 00:58:50.600]  Alex, we gotta let Bush sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.700]  We gotta compromise.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.381]  No!
[00:58:53.843 --> 00:58:55.664]  You're a liberal, man.
[00:58:55.704 --> 00:58:57.344]  I mean, think how sick that is.
[00:58:57.725 --> 00:58:59.605]  I've had them call me a liberal because I'm pro-God, folks.
[00:58:59.805 --> 00:59:01.826]  That's how warped these neocons are.
[00:59:01.846 --> 00:59:03.927]  They've been listening to this stuff so long.
[00:59:07.808 --> 00:59:09.189]  They were pinkos and didn't know it.
[00:59:09.709 --> 00:59:11.910]  Okay, up next is Bob in Wyoming.
[00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:12.730]  Bob, you're on the air.
[00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:13.170]  Go ahead.
[00:59:13.831 --> 00:59:14.131]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:15.691]  Can you hear me?
[00:59:15.911 --> 00:59:16.152]  Yeah.
[00:59:16.472 --> 00:59:16.712]  Oh, okay.
[00:59:18.274 --> 00:59:23.499]  Yeah, I can't think of anyone that's been more irresponsible with firearms than the U.S.
[00:59:23.519 --> 00:59:25.200]  government in all of history.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:25.541]  Can you?
[00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:31.266]  Slaughtering of Native Americans, slaughtering people at Waco, slaughtering each other, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:31.466 --> 00:59:36.771]  I'd much rather be at odds with random criminals that have just the agenda of
[00:59:37.332 --> 00:59:40.775]  You know, getting ticks for that night or something.
[00:59:40.955 --> 00:59:41.816]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:59:41.836 --> 00:59:44.958]  I mean, look at the crime rate in Chicago and New York compared to Austin, Texas.
[00:59:45.218 --> 00:59:46.559]  You don't have home invasions here.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.341]  These people get killed when they do that.
[00:59:48.601 --> 00:59:55.246]  Well, the government can't wait to give rogue cops and terrorists weapons, as many as they want.
[00:59:55.947 --> 01:00:02.172]  But when it comes to, you know, anyone who, and if you, you know, it's like these guys at this public meeting you were saying, right?
[01:00:02.762 --> 01:00:04.284]  No, we're going after criminals.
[01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:05.685]  You got a problem with that?
[01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:07.707]  Well, who's going to go after the U.S.
[01:00:07.767 --> 01:00:08.248]  Attorney?
[01:00:08.308 --> 01:00:09.169]  That's what I want to know.
[01:00:09.249 --> 01:00:10.210]  Well, that's the point.
[01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:11.311]  I got up and said that.
[01:00:11.351 --> 01:00:12.612]  I said the government's criminal.
[01:00:13.113 --> 01:00:14.314]  Gave a bunch of examples.
[01:00:15.191 --> 01:00:17.092]  Uh, that everybody knows about right here in Texas.
[01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:19.034]  Well, let's take this example here.
[01:00:19.294 --> 01:00:22.656]  Who's gonna go after, uh, you know, we're going after criminals.
[01:00:22.676 --> 01:00:23.516]  You got a problem with that?
[01:00:23.877 --> 01:00:26.799]  Okay, well, whose definition of crime are we using here?
[01:00:26.879 --> 01:00:34.463]  Hitler's definition of crime was if, if you, uh, didn't reveal the location of your firearms with which to oppose Hitler, that was a crime.
[01:00:34.503 --> 01:00:35.564]  See, that's man's law.
[01:00:35.984 --> 01:00:36.825]  Vala prohibita.
[01:00:37.836 --> 01:00:42.617]  And with this Gun Bill Act, Ron in New York, God bless him, he's doing a great job.
[01:00:42.657 --> 01:00:46.158]  If you will look at that legislation, this is absolutely paramount, Alex.
[01:00:46.459 --> 01:00:47.659]  Well, I've read the legislation.
[01:00:47.719 --> 01:00:53.481]  Now, have you ever saw a shrink, no gun, got a misdemeanor, no gun, and the NRA is endorsing this?
[01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:58.362]  But if you commit mass murder, you've got an armed force at your, a henchman at your disposal.
[01:00:58.502 --> 01:01:02.203]  Well, at Ruby Ridge and Waco, they gave medals to the people involved.
[01:01:02.343 --> 01:01:03.644]  This is absolutely paramount.
[01:01:05.535 --> 01:01:13.221]  In that legislation, guaranteed, 100% certainty, it will say any, you know, maybe illegal or unlawful even, I don't know.
[01:01:13.621 --> 01:01:16.503]  It is unlawful for any person to do this.
[01:01:16.623 --> 01:01:19.465]  This will be the consequence for any person and or U.S.
[01:01:19.546 --> 01:01:24.569]  citizen, small c, and words and phrases are absolutely paramount in this kind of legislation.
[01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.832]  If they do pass it, they will pass it, it doesn't matter.
[01:01:28.692 --> 01:01:30.634]  It's not too late after they pass it, see?
[01:01:31.014 --> 01:01:32.115]  Because what you have to do is,
[01:01:32.862 --> 01:01:36.584]  Under pain and penalty of perjury, you file an oath of purgatory.
[01:01:36.624 --> 01:01:37.424]  That's the first step.
[01:01:37.864 --> 01:01:40.025]  I'll let you talk about the legalese when we get back.
[01:01:40.045 --> 01:01:40.385]  Stay there.
[01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:46.908]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.088 --> 01:01:51.509]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:56.031]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:57.412]  The New World Order.
[01:01:58.212 --> 01:01:59.133]  Panama!
[01:01:59.213 --> 01:02:03.436]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.496 --> 01:02:10.422]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:10.562 --> 01:02:12.643]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:12.924 --> 01:02:23.392]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:23.412 --> 01:02:26.234]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind
[01:02:26.314 --> 01:02:27.635]  This is a new two and a half hour video.
[01:02:27.675 --> 01:02:28.936]  Police Day 3 is for you!
[01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:32.038]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:45.797]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:02:46.037 --> 01:02:47.457]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:02:47.937 --> 01:02:49.378]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:02:49.638 --> 01:02:54.819]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:02:55.179 --> 01:02:59.640]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:08.602]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:03:09.122 --> 01:03:10.263]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:14.484]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:21.387]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:25.768]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:03:41.337 --> 01:03:44.818]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:03:45.098 --> 01:03:48.600]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.621]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:03:52.841 --> 01:03:59.003]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:07.326]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:04:07.746 --> 01:04:13.091]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:13.251 --> 01:04:17.014]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.236]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:04:19.296 --> 01:04:21.478]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:04:21.718 --> 01:04:26.963]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:04:27.003 --> 01:04:32.247]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:38.092]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:39.473]  Protect your family.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:47.920]  Big Brother.
[01:04:48.581 --> 01:04:49.641]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:50.342 --> 01:04:51.563]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:52.103 --> 01:04:52.964]  You want answers?
[01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:54.605]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:55.246 --> 01:04:59.089]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:03.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:11.299]  I just want to say that I had a wonderful time last night.
[01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:13.460]  I really did.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:30.568]  All the great people that I had a chance to talk to at the Austin City Council, all the wonderful men and women who care about liberty and freedom, who push the City Council into standing up against the USA Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:35.833]  As well as decrying unconstitutional executive orders.
[01:05:35.953 --> 01:05:36.853]  See the process?
[01:05:36.874 --> 01:05:47.622]  We're now discussing unconstitutional executive orders and the Bill of Rights and federal issues as they concern the states, the counties, the cities.
[01:05:48.042 --> 01:05:48.863]  It's a process.
[01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:49.883]  A Bill of Rights culture.
[01:05:50.103 --> 01:05:51.184]  And the people are involved.
[01:05:51.204 --> 01:05:52.285]  They are engaged.
[01:05:53.606 --> 01:05:54.427]  That's very exciting.
[01:05:55.307 --> 01:06:16.577]  For those that just joined us, I mean, really the big news of the day is that there is a Republican and slash Democrat sponsored bill for the Orrin Hatches and others involved that will ban millions from owning guns, that will create all these new crimes for having guns, that will expand the databases, will go after those that have misdemeanors.
[01:06:17.698 --> 01:06:19.538]  Retroactively, you won't be able to own guns.
[01:06:19.879 --> 01:06:20.639]  That's how it's written.
[01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:25.992]  It's better than the 1968 Gun Control Act, which the NRA, by the way, lobbied for.
[01:06:27.514 --> 01:06:32.339]  And now the NRA is lobbying for this new gun control legislation.
[01:06:32.699 --> 01:06:35.382]  That should just make you so angry.
[01:06:36.703 --> 01:06:43.090]  And again, another example of that same thing happening is McClintock pressed to quit race.
[01:06:44.679 --> 01:07:00.415]  Prominent California Republicans are sharply increasing the pressure on State Senator Tom McClintock to drop out of the gubernatorial recall election clearing the field for Arnold Schwarzenegger after the polls show the actor's performance in Wednesday night's debate was well received.
[01:07:01.238 --> 01:07:07.981]  It's everyone's preference to have one Republican on the ballot, said Mike Whitmute, spokesman for the California Republican Party.
[01:07:08.461 --> 01:07:10.321]  How we get there is still in dispute.
[01:07:10.802 --> 01:07:14.423]  Will it happen on its own or will it take more pressure in terms of endorsements?
[01:07:15.103 --> 01:07:17.004]  The pressure increased greatly yesterday.
[01:07:17.044 --> 01:07:27.308]  The 58 members of the California Republican County Chairman's Association endorsed Mr. Nazi yesterday by a 49 vote with five abstentions.
[01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:28.770]  And it goes on and on.
[01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:43.218]  Representative Daryl Issa, the Republican governor, I mean, the Republican who earlier was going to run for governor, who financed the signature gathering phase of the state's first ever recall of a governor, will be in the state today to give his endorsement.
[01:07:43.998 --> 01:07:46.179]  We're a close friend of Mr. McClintock.
[01:07:46.199 --> 01:07:54.143]  Mr. Issa is expected to tap Mr. Schwarzenegger as the party's best candidate to beat Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante.
[01:07:55.871 --> 01:08:02.874]  Folks, that is horrible of ISSA and that's horrible of not endorsing McClintock.
[01:08:03.575 --> 01:08:07.016]  And that is so classic and shows how staged this is.
[01:08:09.037 --> 01:08:19.502]  That they would want to have someone in there who is a carbon copy of Cruz, racist Bustamante, Mr. Mecha.
[01:08:20.642 --> 01:08:22.203]  Cruz Bustamante
[01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:26.705]  He is basically a Hispanic Ku Klux Klan member.
[01:08:26.745 --> 01:08:32.669]  He's a member of organizations that call for driving whites out of California and setting up a racial state.
[01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:34.770]  He's been on the record doing that.
[01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:38.072]  But Arnold Schwarzenegger supports that racist state.
[01:08:38.492 --> 01:08:41.514]  Arnold Schwarzenegger supports gun control and abortion on demand.
[01:08:41.714 --> 01:08:44.055]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger says he admires Hitler.
[01:08:44.956 --> 01:08:50.619]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger is involved in Robert Mapplethorpe photos that are so grisly no one will release them.
[01:08:52.782 --> 01:08:56.765]  We're not talking about the other homosexual magazines, folks, with Arnold just naked.
[01:08:56.785 --> 01:08:57.866]  We're talking about other stuff.
[01:08:58.186 --> 01:09:01.109]  I'm not going to get into it here, but these photos reportedly show.
[01:09:03.491 --> 01:09:07.334]  But this shows how, again, they're just, oh, we've got to go with Arnold.
[01:09:07.374 --> 01:09:08.314]  We've got to go with Arnold.
[01:09:08.334 --> 01:09:09.415]  We've got to support Arnold.
[01:09:09.735 --> 01:09:12.798]  And what they said before, when the news was saying Arnold wasn't going to run.
[01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:22.353]  A month before he announced, there was a San Francisco Chronicle saying, well, the Bohemian Grove, where the National Republicans meet, have said that Arnold will be the man.
[01:09:22.553 --> 01:09:24.214]  I got on the air and said, well, Arnold will be the man.
[01:09:24.654 --> 01:09:26.615]  Because the Bohemian Grove is where the bosses are at.
[01:09:27.636 --> 01:09:29.017]  They chose Ronald Reagan there.
[01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:31.078]  They chose Richard Nixon there.
[01:09:31.478 --> 01:09:33.259]  They developed the Manhattan Project there.
[01:09:33.339 --> 01:09:35.080]  Star Wars there, was hatched there.
[01:09:35.981 --> 01:09:41.524]  This is where the so-called fall of the Soviet Union was engineered there, with Russian premiers visiting.
[01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:45.571]  This is where they really make a lot of the deals there.
[01:09:47.952 --> 01:09:55.536]  And there was another article last week out of the San Francisco Chronicle admitting that the Bohemian Grove was running this election.
[01:09:58.397 --> 01:10:01.559]  So, what type of Republican Party is there?
[01:10:02.379 --> 01:10:10.363]  Where everything is diametrically opposed to what conservatives, Christians, patriots, freedom lovers endorse and believe in.
[01:10:11.434 --> 01:10:15.835]  I gotta go to these calls quick, we've got the cloning doctor coming on in about 15 minutes.
[01:10:16.876 --> 01:10:28.779]  Right now, real quick, Bob Wyoming was talking about how they can pass this new draconian gun control law, going after those that have misdemeanors or ever saw a psychologist, won't be able to own a gun, retroactively.
[01:10:29.539 --> 01:10:35.941]  But he was saying that the way they write these laws, it's all in a corporate fiction, and kind of encapsulate that for folks.
[01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:37.122]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:10:37.142 --> 01:10:37.782]  And this is how
[01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:46.525]  We, the American people, can right now, without having to convince any more people, to right now restore the Republic from this overthrow of our Republic.
[01:10:47.565 --> 01:10:54.887]  If you read the legislation and just substitute the word incorporated legal fiction to own any firearm, you know, then it becomes clear.
[01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:56.128]  You understand what I'm saying?
[01:10:56.148 --> 01:10:56.828]  I hope others do.
[01:10:57.488 --> 01:11:06.011]  Now, what it means is you have to have the standing before law, before the organic law, the law of nature, nature's God and the Declaration of Independence.
[01:11:06.565 --> 01:11:13.330]  In order to bring prosecution, according to law, against these thugs.
[01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:21.115]  And see, I'm conservatively going to guess that maybe 60% of the American people are at least dimly aware of the fact that the U.S.
[01:11:21.155 --> 01:11:22.836]  government engineered 9-11.
[01:11:23.396 --> 01:11:24.157]  Absolute fact.
[01:11:24.857 --> 01:11:29.420]  And there may be 30%, that's all conservative estimates, that are doing something about it.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.542]  Telling people, talking, at least to some extent.
[01:11:31.922 --> 01:11:34.604]  If even half of those, or a small percentage of those,
[01:11:35.202 --> 01:11:57.123]  Would understand that one point, and under oath, on file with their county recorder, where that's where the power is, at least in the western part of America, and will file that oath purgatory that I am a natural man, and I own all of my legal fictions imputed to me by copyright, trademark, and all that.
[01:11:57.597 --> 01:11:58.497]  See, then it's sworn.
[01:11:58.537 --> 01:12:01.458]  Then in order to controvert that, they have to swear that you're not.
[01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:02.339]  They're not going to do that.
[01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:02.899]  I hear you.
[01:12:02.999 --> 01:12:04.159]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:04.960]  Thanks for the call.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.520]  And what he's saying is true.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:13.443]  And the global corporations operate under this maritime law and give themselves all their rights and call themselves sovereigns.
[01:12:13.843 --> 01:12:16.024]  The problem is they don't even follow their own laws now.
[01:12:16.044 --> 01:12:17.544]  They have a double standard.
[01:12:18.225 --> 01:12:20.846]  But it certainly is worth investigating, folks.
[01:12:20.866 --> 01:12:22.326]  I think it's pretty complex.
[01:12:22.946 --> 01:12:23.647]  H.W.
[01:12:23.747 --> 01:12:24.527]  in Colorado.
[01:12:24.547 --> 01:12:25.487]  Go ahead, H.W.
[01:12:25.868 --> 01:12:26.528]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:27.373 --> 01:12:48.400]  I sure am glad you're speaking like a man in this desperate world of politicians and liars and thieves as to the individual of its right to live its individual living.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.361]  I hope
[01:12:55.144 --> 01:13:05.368]  We're going to get to philosophy of life, maybe in the conversation, because that is the issue.
[01:13:06.289 --> 01:13:13.332]  Life is way beyond all these politicians and crooks here on this earth.
[01:13:15.172 --> 01:13:23.616]  I do not know all the secrets, but I do not necessarily fight for life with a gun.
[01:13:24.486 --> 01:13:28.209]  I'm more inclined to let them name me to the cross.
[01:13:29.049 --> 01:13:32.171]  During my path of life, I suffered a lot.
[01:13:33.012 --> 01:13:54.086]  It started kind of with Hitler in 39, my dad being in the war in Russia, and so he was in jail the first part of it, then had to sort of earn his way out of it by being put in the front line.
[01:13:54.927 --> 01:14:01.492]  And yet the bar is back.
[01:14:02.753 --> 01:14:09.058]  But this is a very confused world right now.
[01:14:10.198 --> 01:14:16.503]  You're the only guy that I can hear on this continent speaking like a man.
[01:14:16.523 --> 01:14:20.806]  All these others are wimps, they're military, they're complex.
[01:14:22.447 --> 01:14:22.928]  Are you there?
[01:14:23.656 --> 01:14:36.168]  I am, and thanks for the compliments, but it is sick to see everybody selling out their families, selling out their children and grandchildren, just mindlessly being part of the establishment, rationalizing what they're part of and all their stuff suits.
[01:14:36.729 --> 01:14:42.474]  When they had any understanding of a context of history, they could see that we are in societal crisis.
[01:14:42.795 --> 01:14:45.798]  We are in a decadent downward spiral right now.
[01:14:46.498 --> 01:14:46.739]  Yeah.
[01:14:47.039 --> 01:15:02.055]  And only bold men and women getting involved and grabbing the bull by the horns and saying no to tyranny and rediscovering liberty and energizing the population with a warning of the tyranny, only by doing that can we save the society and ourselves.
[01:15:02.295 --> 01:15:04.177]  Yeah, I just got here.
[01:15:04.197 --> 01:15:06.640]  9-11 wrote the tyranny and police stayed free.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:07.761]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:15:07.821 --> 01:15:19.888]  I'm distributing it in the neighborhood, but these people sort of want to close off the ears, but I'm sort of insisting, because with my own life story, I'm kind of convincing.
[01:15:21.569 --> 01:15:35.258]  I used to be against guns, being European, a German, having suffered a lot under Hitler, but now I do know
[01:15:36.184 --> 01:15:42.549]  And I maybe learned this in this country, somewhere you have to defend your ground.
[01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:43.270]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:45.432]  When you give your guns up, only the bad people have them.
[01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:50.736]  Sir, I really appreciate your call and take care of H.W.
[01:15:50.756 --> 01:15:53.779]  We're going to come back and talk to Rudy in New Mexico.
[01:15:56.554 --> 01:16:06.279]  Others in New Mexico and of course folks in Florida will take a bunch of your calls and I do have more news coming up and we have this cloning doctor coming on who's pushing all the cloning.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:11.221]  That should be an interesting little discussion with one of the top cloning experts in the world.
[01:16:11.822 --> 01:16:13.943]  That's about 10-15 minutes away.
[01:16:13.963 --> 01:16:16.824]  When we get back we'll take some more calls so stay with us.
[01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:24.268]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPilot.com and the globalists can't have their way unless you lay down and let them.
[01:16:25.387 --> 01:16:26.288]  Have their way with you.
[01:16:26.788 --> 01:16:29.290]  So stop letting the New World Order rape you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:30.732]  Say no.
[01:16:32.053 --> 01:16:32.954]  It's really that simple.
[01:16:33.554 --> 01:16:38.678]  The old Chinese adage of a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:16:38.718 --> 01:16:41.541]  Well, we're more than a single step forward in this fight.

[01:18:41.522 --> 01:18:42.522]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:42.582 --> 01:18:47.364]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:47.524 --> 01:18:55.346]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:18:55.606 --> 01:19:00.968]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:01.188 --> 01:19:08.150]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:13.794]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:19:14.054 --> 01:19:18.797]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:19:19.137 --> 01:19:26.762]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:32.546]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:19:33.627 --> 01:19:36.769]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:37.489 --> 01:19:38.329]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.491]  Oh my God!
[01:19:41.751 --> 01:19:46.473]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:19:46.773 --> 01:19:47.433]  Yes, it's true.
[01:19:47.513 --> 01:19:50.194]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:19:50.355 --> 01:19:54.376]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:19:54.476 --> 01:19:55.057]  You heard it right.
[01:19:55.217 --> 01:20:00.219]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:20:00.359 --> 01:20:01.420]  The list goes on and on.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.763]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:08.005]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:20:08.185 --> 01:20:09.386]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:20:09.526 --> 01:20:13.850]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:18.653]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:23.077]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:20:23.117 --> 01:20:24.338]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine,
[01:20:29.662 --> 01:20:30.523]  All right, folks.
[01:20:30.543 --> 01:20:32.604]  Right back to the open phones on Open Line Friday.
[01:20:32.624 --> 01:20:34.245]  Let's talk to Rudy in New Mexico.
[01:20:34.285 --> 01:20:35.006]  Rudy, welcome, sir.
[01:20:35.026 --> 01:20:36.287]  Good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:20:58.951 --> 01:21:00.891]  Okay, Rudy may have stepped away from the phone for a moment.
[01:21:00.911 --> 01:21:01.632]  Let's put him on hold.
[01:21:01.652 --> 01:21:03.212]  Let's talk to Margo in New Mexico.
[01:21:03.272 --> 01:21:04.272]  Margo, you're on the air.
[01:21:04.312 --> 01:21:04.692]  Go ahead.
[01:21:05.112 --> 01:21:05.653]  Hi, Alex.
[01:21:05.973 --> 01:21:06.313]  Welcome.
[01:21:06.913 --> 01:21:10.874]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to tell you I had a fantastic time off the mainland.
[01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:12.514]  I was in Hawaii for a week.
[01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.455]  It was like going back 20 years in time.
[01:21:15.175 --> 01:21:23.597]  But it was like fast decompression when I got back because as soon as we had a stopover in California, the pilot told us on the intercom to vote for Arnold.
[01:21:24.977 --> 01:21:26.217]  And it went downhill from there.
[01:21:26.237 --> 01:21:28.418]  It turns out PSA ruined our vacation.
[01:21:28.939 --> 01:21:31.002]  Well I've been talking to people.
[01:21:31.022 --> 01:21:32.223]  I've been talking to people.
[01:21:45.582 --> 01:21:52.265]  And they will take their expensive shampoo, dump it all out in four or five different bottles of conditioner.
[01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:53.846]  They will break things.
[01:21:54.586 --> 01:22:01.189]  And usually, I'm not joking when I say this, in Boston Airport it was like 90% illegals and 60% of those were Arabs.
[01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:07.372]  And I'm not against Arabs, folks, but come on, when you've got a guy with a turban on who's here illegally and he's running security.
[01:22:07.832 --> 01:22:10.834]  I mean, it's just... And then, I know celebrities.
[01:22:10.894 --> 01:22:13.115]  When you're a celebrity, they really harass you.
[01:22:14.355 --> 01:22:15.916]  It's all about a petty power trip.
[01:22:15.936 --> 01:22:17.596]  It's about training us how to be slaves.
[01:22:17.776 --> 01:22:19.016]  But they won't arm the pilots.
[01:22:19.276 --> 01:22:23.597]  That would handle any of the problems, even if there were real hijackers.
[01:22:23.717 --> 01:22:26.098]  And I've heard that, where they break computers open.
[01:22:26.338 --> 01:22:32.760]  You'll get home after your vacation, or you'll get to your vacation, and if you put your hard drive in there, they go, this might be a bomb!
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.201]  And they will bash it open with a hammer, and then there's nothing you can do.
[01:22:38.261 --> 01:22:39.161]  So that happened to you?
[01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:40.081]  It sure did.
[01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.922]  And what was so upsetting about it, though, was
[01:22:42.302 --> 01:22:51.348]  They hand inspected our bags after redundant x-ray security and then they told me I could re-secure my bag and they wouldn't have anything more with it.
[01:22:51.869 --> 01:22:57.413]  But then when we got back home and I opened the bag, it was like it was in pieces, literally.
[01:22:57.453 --> 01:23:10.762]  They had, like, just manhandled it, busted open the case, and the circuit board had screws attaching the circuit board to the drive, and the screws were missing from the suitcase, and it was just all in pieces.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.483]  And they didn't even leave a note in that particular suitcase.
[01:23:15.144 --> 01:23:20.450]  In the other suitcase, they did reattach a sticker and leave one of those little courtesy notes.
[01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:21.911]  Courtesy!
[01:23:22.592 --> 01:23:26.476]  And get this, when you call them, the government agency, they give you a number to call.
[01:23:27.157 --> 01:23:28.358]  It's a disconnected number.
[01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:34.725]  And so you go into a black hole before you finally get the proper address, and we had gone to the TSA website.
[01:23:34.745 --> 01:23:42.850]  But notice the borders are wide open, they're protecting all these terrorist groups, new articles every day, ISI, CIA controls Al Qaeda, you know, Reuters, AFP.
[01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:49.315]  It's all out there, but you're gonna, and now they say under the next attack, there are gonna be troops on the streets, on the bridges, in the factories.
[01:23:49.615 --> 01:23:50.776]  This is our new life.
[01:23:50.976 --> 01:23:51.696]  Thanks for the call.
[01:23:51.716 --> 01:23:52.397]  Thank you.
[01:23:52.517 --> 01:23:53.458]  Sorry to hear that happen.
[01:23:53.558 --> 01:23:55.159]  Is Rudy still there, or is he gone?
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:58.401]  Okay, who's up next, Mark?
[01:23:59.258 --> 01:24:00.438]  Gene in Florida, go ahead.
[01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:02.979]  Hello?
[01:24:03.259 --> 01:24:03.519]  Yes!
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.100]  Okay, you may have already heard of this.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.201]  We only get to hear you about 50 minutes a day here.
[01:24:10.002 --> 01:24:14.623]  Have you heard about the new system that's replacing the data system the Pentagon is trying to set up?
[01:24:14.923 --> 01:24:17.164]  Well, I know they have the Matrix system at the state level.
[01:24:17.544 --> 01:24:20.565]  It's called Echelon, part of NSA that's been there for decades.
[01:24:21.285 --> 01:24:23.546]  I'm talking about the one they're hiding in Florida.
[01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:25.627]  Matrix?
[01:24:26.502 --> 01:24:30.723]  Yes, it's taken the place of the Pentagon's database.
[01:24:31.063 --> 01:24:32.984]  So, are you a listener to us in Pensacola?
[01:24:33.244 --> 01:24:33.384]  Yep.
[01:24:33.804 --> 01:24:35.364]  And they're only carrying 50 minutes of the show?
[01:24:35.384 --> 01:24:41.386]  Well, you get to hear you 5 to 10 minutes before 12 and then from about 12.45 to 1.
[01:24:41.566 --> 01:24:46.847]  Yeah, well that's a great station.
[01:24:46.888 --> 01:24:48.128]  I wish they'd pick more of the show up.
[01:24:48.228 --> 01:24:49.508]  Aren't we on there at night though?
[01:24:49.988 --> 01:24:51.249]  Oh yeah, I listen to you at night.
[01:24:52.836 --> 01:24:56.618]  Well, folks, you've got to support the show and tell the stations to pick up more of the show.
[01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:59.839]  That is so important to such a great group of people down there.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:09.324]  We need to be on the air there so people know that the NRA is supporting total gun registration and banning people with misdemeanors from owning guns.
[01:25:09.724 --> 01:25:10.865]  That's why this show is important.
[01:25:11.025 --> 01:25:14.207]  We're not like the other shows that tell you that Moloch is a Christian God.
[01:25:15.687 --> 01:25:18.729]  Anyway, this was by Associated Press out of New York.
[01:25:19.733 --> 01:25:25.899]  It's run by a company called S-E-I-S-I-N-T Incorporated out of Boca Raton.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.046]  It was supposedly started by a guy who used to fly plane loads of drugs into the U.S.
[01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:32.586]  back in the 1980s.
[01:25:34.373 --> 01:25:37.114]  Federal government's already put twelve million dollars into it.
[01:25:37.354 --> 01:25:41.476]  And they've had big problems with convicted felons running some of the database systems.
[01:25:41.516 --> 01:25:43.737]  Well, Poindexter, but others.
[01:25:44.077 --> 01:25:45.198]  And yeah, I had seen that.
[01:25:45.278 --> 01:25:47.118]  I mean, look, this is a pack of criminals.
[01:25:48.659 --> 01:25:51.040]  It's federally funded, twelve million dollars.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:54.181]  The State Florida Department of Law Enforcement guards it.
[01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:55.862]  And it's private property.
[01:25:55.922 --> 01:25:58.483]  It's called multi-state anti-terrorism.
[01:25:59.102 --> 01:26:02.525]  Information Exchange, and it can monitor innocent civilians.
[01:26:02.585 --> 01:26:04.166]  Yeah, that's, that's Matrix.
[01:26:05.107 --> 01:26:08.909]  And, uh, I wrote an article called DARPA Engineering the Beast System.
[01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:10.891]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[01:26:10.971 --> 01:26:12.512]  Sir, I really do appreciate your call.
[01:26:12.832 --> 01:26:13.253]  I'm sorry?
[01:26:13.633 --> 01:26:15.254]  I said, I really do appreciate your call.
[01:26:16.255 --> 01:26:16.695]  Thank you.
[01:26:16.935 --> 01:26:18.096]  I'd love to keep you, hold you over.
[01:26:18.116 --> 01:26:21.179]  We got a guest coming up, though, and we'll get to the other callers you're patiently holding, too.
[01:26:21.939 --> 01:26:22.860]  We've got this, uh,
[01:26:24.557 --> 01:26:29.244]  It's Dr. Michael Zaios coming on to talk about cloning.
[01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:29.725]  Stay with us.
[01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:33.891]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.352 --> 01:26:35.974]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.895 --> 01:26:39.579]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.001 --> 01:26:48.344]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:55.708]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the at least- 0-3-4-4-3-8.
[01:26:56.068 --> 01:26:57.629]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:26:57.889 --> 01:26:59.750]  That's toll-free, triple-eight, 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[01:27:14.827 --> 01:27:16.549]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2.
[01:27:16.589 --> 01:27:20.171]  And then back from 9 to midnight, we do this show nationwide.
[01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:20.932]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:27:20.952 --> 01:27:24.315]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:24.455 --> 01:27:26.817]  Certainly check them out today and spread the word.
[01:27:27.197 --> 01:27:31.481]  We're joined by Dr. Panos Michael Zavos.
[01:27:31.561 --> 01:27:32.902]  And he's pretty famous, folks.
[01:27:32.982 --> 01:27:33.883]  You've probably heard of him.
[01:27:34.603 --> 01:27:36.264]  Here's a new scientist article.
[01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:39.267]  First human clone embryo ready for implantation.
[01:27:39.307 --> 01:27:44.171]  The first human clone embryo to be implanted into a surrogate mother's womb before the end of the year.
[01:27:44.987 --> 01:27:45.067]  U.S.
[01:27:45.107 --> 01:27:55.154]  fertility expert Seyvos claimed on Monday the attempt follows months of practicing in the lab on hundreds of hybrid embryos.
[01:27:55.614 --> 01:27:56.254]  Hybrid, folks!
[01:27:56.634 --> 01:28:02.118]  Made by fusing human cells with an empty cow eggs, Seyvos told a press conference in London.
[01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:06.485]  Well, good afternoon and good morning to all of you out there.
[01:28:22.066 --> 01:28:30.134]  Now, just tell us a little bit about yourself, and for those that don't know who you are, I would imagine most of our listeners, probably 80%, have seen you on national television or in the newspaper.
[01:28:30.635 --> 01:28:31.956]  This is pretty controversial stuff.
[01:28:32.236 --> 01:28:34.618]  Tell us about yourself, exactly how you got into this and what you're doing.
[01:28:35.139 --> 01:28:41.065]  Well, my basic training is in reproductive medicine, and therefore I do help couples become parents.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:54.745]  And certainly in our area of expertise, we not only do obviously the traditional stuff, but we develop new technologies and we pioneer new technologies because simply the world evolves every day.
[01:28:55.806 --> 01:29:03.549]  And it is our understanding that cloning will be eventually available to humanity within my lifetime and yours.
[01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:08.951]  And because those things are really close to our understanding and
[01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:11.099]  I think so.
[01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:28.550]  Well, what about the Raelians?
[01:29:28.570 --> 01:29:33.612]  I mean, it was clear that they didn't have the know-how and that it was a publicity stunt by the fruitcake cult.
[01:29:34.012 --> 01:29:45.679]  You have quite an extensive background as a top scientist, recognized globally as one of the top three fertility specialists, and you have the know-how to do this, so you've been received with a lot of credibility.
[01:29:45.959 --> 01:29:53.583]  You're saying that you now have this human being, this acorn, this embryo ready for implantation?
[01:29:54.517 --> 01:29:55.117]  Yes, sir, we do.
[01:29:55.177 --> 01:30:00.100]  And of course, you know, please avoid using the term Raelians, because we have nothing to do with them.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:07.163]  They may very well be on another planet today, and so we're really going to talk about the facts, not about fiction.
[01:30:07.183 --> 01:30:10.204]  Well, no, but for a lot of people, that got so much attention.
[01:30:10.244 --> 01:30:11.225]  I want to make it clear.
[01:30:11.525 --> 01:30:14.746]  Let me make it clear that the Raelians have nothing to offer.
[01:30:14.766 --> 01:30:17.087]  The Raelians know nothing about this.
[01:30:17.448 --> 01:30:19.629]  Baby Eve and company never existed.
[01:30:20.069 --> 01:30:22.770]  It was pure lie from the beginning, and I obviously got
[01:30:23.522 --> 01:30:30.724]  God knows how many shows I've made just to tell the world that those people don't have any credibility, and therefore they're a bunch of crooks.
[01:30:30.964 --> 01:30:39.507]  Now, however, if you and I were making wine and somebody's a crook in the wine business, we may end up being crooks as well, at least found guilty by association.
[01:30:40.207 --> 01:30:52.491]  We resent that, of course, but I think time has shown that they faded away, or they fizzled, as I say, like Alka-Seltzer, and we're still here, and we're still carrying the effort, because we are for real.
[01:30:53.385 --> 01:31:03.911]  Well, Dr. Zabos, I just wanted to, for those that haven't followed, I wanted to know that you're a real scientist, really doing this, and I wanted to make it clear that you weren't connected to that group.
[01:31:04.011 --> 01:31:04.951]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:31:05.492 --> 01:31:07.353]  Dr. Zabos, I'm going to be up front with you.
[01:31:07.953 --> 01:31:14.096]  Well, just for a few minutes, tell folks about your training and how you got into this, and then I want to get into the current cloning program.
[01:31:14.977 --> 01:31:21.000]  Well, you know, if I'm a purist, obviously, and in some respect I am,
[01:31:22.013 --> 01:31:25.676]  I think God put me on this earth to help a fellow man and a woman.
[01:31:26.717 --> 01:31:33.022]  If I'm an expert in reproductive medicine, then obviously I'm helping people, couples, become parents.
[01:31:33.667 --> 01:31:45.154]  If I was a cardiac surgeon who would be helping people develop better hearts or via heart transplantation, obviously make them live longer and a better quality of life.
[01:31:45.754 --> 01:31:51.757]  So, to make a long story short, my expertise really enables me to help people in the reproductive arena.
[01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:58.361]  I got in it because, very simply, this technology inevitably will be developed in my lifetime and yours.
[01:31:59.065 --> 01:32:12.948]  And instead of leaving it to the Raelians or to some other, I don't know, people like them to develop this technology and abuse it and tell us, you know, that, hey, we developed it, we patented it and therefore you need to come to us.
[01:32:13.678 --> 01:32:31.248]  In order to have access to this technology, we decided that we're going to get involved and make this into a medical procedure that can help only, and I like to emphasize that, only people that wish to reproduce and have biological children of their own that they cannot reproduce in any other way, shape, and form.
[01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:38.953]  Let me stop you, Dr. Zabos, because understanding this, the procedure, how is it
[01:32:39.631 --> 01:32:42.554]  Now it's a clone, so it's just a clone of one of the parents?
[01:32:42.934 --> 01:32:44.556]  Or what's the procedure?
[01:32:44.576 --> 01:32:45.196]  How does this work?
[01:32:45.617 --> 01:32:50.781]  Well, simply put, we use an enucleated egg, which is an egg shell.
[01:32:51.542 --> 01:32:52.023]  Okay?
[01:32:52.123 --> 01:32:58.188]  It does contain the material, the fluid, but it does not contain the DNA that comes with that egg.
[01:32:58.789 --> 01:33:04.394]  Then having created that enucleated egg, which we can get from any woman, after we remove
[01:33:04.973 --> 01:33:14.659]  After we remove that nucleus from that egg, then that egg really does not have any identity aimed towards the producer of that egg.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:26.647]  If I take it from my wife, or yours, or your girlfriend, or mine, and I nucleate it, it really has very little material in it other than the riposomal DNA, we call it, which is only about 12 to 14
[01:33:30.094 --> 01:33:31.075]  I think so.
[01:33:52.463 --> 01:33:57.447]  That is very alert, it's a very ongoing cell, it's a very upbeat cell.
[01:33:57.907 --> 01:34:04.312]  And then we can do, not a nuclear transfer, as the term implies, we do transfer a nucleus of the cell.
[01:34:04.653 --> 01:34:11.478]  We transfer the whole cell into the egg, side by side with the membrane of the egg.
[01:34:11.558 --> 01:34:18.924]  And then it's a very fancy technology that we developed where we fuse the two cells over a period of about 6 to 10 or 12 hours.
[01:34:20.695 --> 01:34:24.338]  And then the one recognizes the other just like during fertilization.
[01:34:24.778 --> 01:34:38.969]  But instead of putting the egg and the sperm together, we put the whole DNA comes from you into an egg that is obviously recognizing it as such and creating an embryo that begins to develop like an irregular embryo.
[01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:42.092]  After we create that embryo, you can tell the difference.
[01:34:42.993 --> 01:34:45.875]  And then of course we do an embryo transfer like we do through an IVF.
[01:34:46.678 --> 01:34:51.142]  And we expect that pregnancy to take place about 30 to 40 percent of the time.
[01:34:51.863 --> 01:34:56.527]  Okay, Dr. Zavos, this is obviously riveting information because you really are doing this.
[01:34:56.627 --> 01:35:01.512]  I want to talk about how you say that by the end of the year this is going to be implanted in a woman.
[01:35:01.772 --> 01:35:02.293]  Yes.
[01:35:02.413 --> 01:35:09.440]  But, I mean, I really have you here because you are the world expert other than maybe secret government activities have been going on underground for a while.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:09.840]  Yes.
[01:35:12.552 --> 01:35:17.317]  Look, we know with Dolly the Sheep and the rhesus monkeys and all this, there have been problems.
[01:35:17.517 --> 01:35:35.093]  Is that because it was older cell material that has already had some DNA breakdown, or why have they had problems with clones, and how are you going to stop having this embryo develop with deformities or problems, and what would be the procedure if you saw that there was problems in the development, would you abort it?
[01:35:36.011 --> 01:35:43.396]  Well, I don't want to be too critical, but I've got to be very honest, because I've got to give you a straightforward answer to your question, which is an excellent question.
[01:35:44.137 --> 01:35:46.698]  First of all, Dolly was produced in 1996.
[01:35:48.059 --> 01:35:52.963]  Now, Dolly grew up to be a six-and-a-half-year-old sheep that died.
[01:35:53.523 --> 01:35:58.687]  Normally, sheep that old do die, or they're slaughtered for meat, or whatever other purposes.
[01:35:59.647 --> 01:36:02.189]  And therefore, the longevity in sheep is a relative thing.
[01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:11.279]  Now, Dolly, obviously, being produced, what, 96, 7, 8 years ago, that's old technology.
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.080]  I mean, this technology develops every day now.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:25.723]  I mean, it has tremendously evolved, and we know a heck of a lot more today how to clone something, other than what Ian Wilmut, the guy that did Dolly, tried 227 times and created one animal.
[01:36:28.784 --> 01:36:30.005]  Well, let me just say this, Dr. Zavos.
[01:36:30.385 --> 01:36:34.647]  I mean, I consider it the fact that you and others have produced human embryo clones.
[01:36:34.667 --> 01:36:35.607]  I mean, that's a human being.
[01:36:35.827 --> 01:36:36.888]  Human cloning has been done.
[01:36:38.088 --> 01:36:40.389]  Government laboratories, we know they have advanced technologies.
[01:36:40.409 --> 01:36:41.790]  We know they're doing a lot of different things.
[01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:48.873]  In your research, in your work, in talking to the global genetic engineering and biotech community,
[01:36:49.854 --> 01:37:00.422]  I mean, obviously, you want the crown for the first guy to clone a human being and have it come to term, but, I mean, really, do you really think they haven't already done that in one of their Level 4 bio labs?
[01:37:01.663 --> 01:37:12.971]  I have no, you know, I don't have any information, and so, you know, in my business, I can only speak on what I know and what I see and what I touch.
[01:37:13.846 --> 01:37:18.307]  Therefore, you know, for me to speculate, it's very, very inappropriate.
[01:37:18.367 --> 01:37:23.148]  And therefore, you know, whether they have one or not, it's insignificant right now.
[01:37:23.188 --> 01:37:27.029]  But let's get back to the Dolly issue, because I think that's very interesting.
[01:37:27.949 --> 01:37:30.649]  You know, they have produced one sheep.
[01:37:30.869 --> 01:37:38.211]  Unfortunately, they have not been able to produce others like Dolly, because we're simply, you know, they were not that good of experts.
[01:37:38.231 --> 01:37:39.651]  I mean, you know, everybody can
[01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.470]  Okay.
[01:37:59.156 --> 01:38:09.326]  Humans are not monkeys, or monkeys are not rats, and therefore, because of that, there's a species specificity and a difference between the various species, and therefore some species are much easier to clone than others.
[01:38:09.766 --> 01:38:15.832]  Yes, we may be close relatives to the monkeys, but one of our closest relatives is a pig.
[01:38:16.633 --> 01:38:20.056]  And pigs have been cloned very successfully in England and in the U.S.
[01:38:21.051 --> 01:38:23.473]  Aren't we closely related to rats?
[01:38:23.493 --> 01:38:24.754]  This is all relative.
[01:38:24.994 --> 01:38:27.556]  But we're also closely related to the rat, correct?
[01:38:27.856 --> 01:38:31.499]  Well, the rat is cloned, as a matter of fact, in the news today.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.821]  The first rat was cloned in France.
[01:38:35.321 --> 01:38:36.322]  Yeah.
[01:38:36.422 --> 01:38:46.890]  And therefore, I think that looking at an assembly line here where they can clone rats for creating, you know, the ideal experimental model, biological model that is, for future use.
[01:38:48.896 --> 01:38:56.422]  It comes down to show that the cloning technology can be used constructively to creating a better world for all of us.
[01:38:56.522 --> 01:39:05.509]  Now, I do know how radical and how frightening it sounds, it even sounds to me, to clone a human being.
[01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:12.835]  But let's get real, as we say, whatever happens in the rat and the pig and the monkey and whatever, eventually it trickles down to the human.
[01:39:13.135 --> 01:39:16.438]  Let me stop you, Dr. Zavos, because I've got to throw some bullet point questions out at you.
[01:39:17.276 --> 01:39:22.099]  Do you think a cloned human being who was born will be a human being, and do you think they have a soul?
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.821]  There's no doubt that they would have a soul.
[01:39:24.901 --> 01:39:31.645]  I mean, the same question was asked by a lady on a flight between Paris and Cincinnati, Ohio.
[01:39:32.365 --> 01:39:34.386]  And she says, would they have a soul?
[01:39:34.466 --> 01:39:37.348]  And my question to her is, do you have one?
[01:39:37.408 --> 01:39:38.069]  She says, yes.
[01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:40.010]  And I turned around and I said, well,
[01:39:40.609 --> 01:39:41.990]  Show it to me for crying out loud!
[01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:43.431]  Will they have rights?
[01:39:43.451 --> 01:39:45.172]  Or will they be... Well, why not?
[01:39:45.592 --> 01:39:46.853]  I mean, you know... Let me finish the question.
[01:39:46.873 --> 01:39:51.816]  I should say that, with all due respect, 25 years ago, that Louise Brown would not have any of those things.
[01:39:52.717 --> 01:39:56.219]  And I know Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby, personally.
[01:39:56.299 --> 01:39:58.661]  And I must tell you that Louise is a very gracious lady.
[01:39:58.981 --> 01:39:59.802]  So is her sister.
[01:40:00.642 --> 01:40:09.428]  And the guy that produced her, that is Bob Edwards, who happens to be a mentor and somebody that I admire immensely and a very good friend.
[01:40:10.376 --> 01:40:16.000]  Okay, but the point I'm trying to get at here is that, uh, not you, Doctor.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.404]  Yes, they'll have souls, and they'll have rights, and they'll have just about everything, all of the above.
[01:40:20.744 --> 01:40:22.745]  Dr. Zabos, let me just get a few questions out here to you.
[01:40:22.765 --> 01:40:23.426]  This is important.
[01:40:24.246 --> 01:40:25.387]  What I'm saying is this.
[01:40:25.627 --> 01:40:26.108]  Not you.
[01:40:26.148 --> 01:40:28.950]  You're saying you're going to clone for fertility people that can't have children.
[01:40:30.206 --> 01:40:47.416]  But a lot of the biotech firms, a lot of the interest in cloning is to basically grow a humanoid type creature in utero in a cow to get larger tissue yield for organ transplant or brain grafts.
[01:40:48.537 --> 01:40:56.746]  And what about the industrialization of growing human organs inside of a human host body, a clone body?
[01:40:57.027 --> 01:40:58.929]  We see the race towards that.
[01:40:58.949 --> 01:41:00.090]  You talk about assembly lines.
[01:41:00.551 --> 01:41:07.759]  That is frightening and nightmarish and really tampering with an area that God
[01:41:10.932 --> 01:41:18.174]  I understand exactly what you're saying, and George W. Bush said that in his last speech on cloning in the Rose Garden, and I responded to it.
[01:41:19.174 --> 01:41:21.755]  With all due respect, first of all, I am against that.
[01:41:22.796 --> 01:41:25.276]  So let me set the record straight here.
[01:41:25.817 --> 01:41:27.097]  I am totally against that.
[01:41:27.717 --> 01:41:33.099]  Secondly, it would require not me and my participation, although I'd be happy to participate,
[01:41:33.746 --> 01:42:02.101]  But people like George W. Bush and Mr. Jacques Chirac and Mr. Blair and leaders in the world and the United Nations to come to around the table and say this particular abuse is prohibited and it should be outlawed and anybody that does that should be spanked severely and therefore I mean you know in this world today in 2003 I think we have the right to do that and we can do it and I think we've done it for the most part with the nuclear weapons and I think that we've done
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:05.982]  We've done it with other things, and I don't see why this should be excluded.
[01:42:06.123 --> 01:42:12.927]  It's a powerful tool that should be legislated internationally to be prohibited and only be used under certain circumstances.
[01:42:12.967 --> 01:42:18.031]  So, Dr. Zegos, you're saying that we need global government to counter this?
[01:42:18.571 --> 01:42:20.753]  Well, you know, we live in a global world today.
[01:42:23.495 --> 01:42:25.796]  I was in two, three, four countries last week.
[01:42:26.477 --> 01:42:29.559]  It's just like, obviously, being in London, Kentucky and Frankfurt, Kentucky.
[01:42:29.859 --> 01:42:30.259]  I wasn't.
[01:42:30.299 --> 01:42:31.220]  I was in London, England.
[01:42:31.861 --> 01:42:35.123]  And Cyprus, Larnaca, Limassol, Athens, Greece, and what have you.
[01:42:35.543 --> 01:42:40.687]  So, I mean, you know, this is a global world, and I think the global world has the same interests.
[01:42:41.207 --> 01:42:44.749]  Now, obviously, you have physician... As far as the development of such technologies.
[01:42:44.969 --> 01:42:56.216]  Sir, you have physician-patient non-disclosure, which we certainly honor here, but the press has reported that you were involved in cloning programs for wealthy Arabs.
[01:42:56.716 --> 01:42:58.678]  Is that where your program is driving this?
[01:42:58.698 --> 01:42:59.138]  That is not true.
[01:43:00.788 --> 01:43:03.330]  So that is absolutely not true.
[01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:04.871]  Certainly you saw those reports.
[01:43:05.392 --> 01:43:13.518]  Well, listen, if I read every report they write about me and the fictional stuff, obviously I'll probably hang myself tomorrow.
[01:43:13.578 --> 01:43:18.242]  But I do happen to know the facts and therefore my conscience doesn't bother me at all.
[01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:24.947]  There's nothing that I can do to prevent the press from saying and doing the kinds of things they do to sell their newspapers.
[01:43:24.967 --> 01:43:26.208]  Okay, well who funds you then?
[01:43:26.288 --> 01:43:26.768]  I'm curious.
[01:43:26.788 --> 01:43:27.429]  It's got to be expensive.
[01:43:27.469 --> 01:43:28.390]  Well, just to keep
[01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:37.818]  The cooking ware, so to speak, intact and clean and what have you, we decided not to take any money from anyone.
[01:43:37.979 --> 01:43:39.080]  This is private money.
[01:43:39.784 --> 01:43:40.384]  Okay, Dr. Zajos?
[01:44:02.719 --> 01:44:13.685]  This new scientist article saying that you're saying that by the end of this year, this cloned embryo, this human, or humanoid, is going to be implanted in a woman, and then you're going to try to bring it to term.
[01:44:13.785 --> 01:44:14.525]  Is that correct?
[01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:15.225]  That is correct.
[01:44:15.245 --> 01:44:15.986]  Yes, of course.
[01:44:16.386 --> 01:44:23.049]  We created the embryo with the idea of not destroying it, but let me clarify that by what I just said and what you said.
[01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:25.150]  That we are in the process.
[01:44:25.210 --> 01:44:30.173]  We froze this embryo for one reason, and that is to put a stop to our action,
[01:44:30.962 --> 01:44:31.642]  Dr. Zabos, can you... Dr. Zabos!
[01:44:31.662 --> 01:44:32.082]  Dr. Zabos!
[01:44:32.162 --> 01:44:32.463]  Dr. Zabos!
[01:44:32.503 --> 01:44:32.723]  Dr. Zabos!
[01:44:57.352 --> 01:44:58.597]  We'll find out, folks.
[01:44:58.657 --> 01:44:59.379]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:59.901 --> 01:45:01.186]  Yeah, we'll be right back, of course.
[01:45:01.226 --> 01:45:01.547]  Why not?
[01:45:01.647 --> 01:45:02.290]  Okay, stay there.
[01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.531]  Thank you.
[01:45:03.937 --> 01:45:05.898]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:45:05.998 --> 01:45:16.703]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:45:17.083 --> 01:45:21.605]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:45:21.665 --> 01:45:32.990]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:40.435]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:45:40.835 --> 01:45:42.976]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:45:43.477 --> 01:45:48.440]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[01:47:03.644 --> 01:47:10.468]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:47:10.808 --> 01:47:12.169]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:47:12.369 --> 01:47:14.571]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:47:14.731 --> 01:47:16.812]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:47:17.092 --> 01:47:22.015]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:26.398]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:47:26.658 --> 01:47:28.419]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:47:28.499 --> 01:47:39.167]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:47:39.307 --> 01:47:41.208]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:47:41.408 --> 01:47:45.251]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.

[01:47:55.398 --> 01:47:56.419]  This show is documented.
[01:47:56.439 --> 01:47:57.460]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:58.261]  We're talking to Dr. P.M.
[01:47:58.341 --> 01:47:58.461]  Zyvos.
[01:48:18.203 --> 01:48:21.265]  They say he's the real global expert on cloning.
[01:48:21.305 --> 01:48:25.007]  I mean, he's one of the serious people that's out there, and he's got the embryo frozen.
[01:48:26.127 --> 01:48:32.071]  And the human being, ready to implant it, a copy of one of the parents.
[01:48:33.771 --> 01:48:35.572]  And Dr. Zaylo, during the break I was talking to you.
[01:48:35.592 --> 01:48:35.853]  Look.
[01:48:38.434 --> 01:48:45.518]  The genetic engineer companies, the Monsantos of the world, they're putting cockroach genes in tomatoes, splicing goats with spiders to make body armor.
[01:48:46.078 --> 01:48:47.579]  All this horrific stuff
[01:48:48.328 --> 01:48:52.170]  The big companies are racing ahead to create human clones for body parts.
[01:48:53.267 --> 01:48:53.727]  I hope not.
[01:48:54.068 --> 01:48:56.429]  Well, they are racing ahead with Blade Runner type scenarios.
[01:48:56.469 --> 01:48:57.329]  You're not doing that.
[01:48:57.389 --> 01:48:58.730]  I appreciate your honesty coming on the show.
[01:48:59.090 --> 01:48:59.970]  I think it's horrific.
[01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:04.072]  I understand you're not going to stop the march of this, but it seems like we're trying to become God.
[01:49:04.553 --> 01:49:07.054]  And you say governments are the answer, making some laws.
[01:49:07.094 --> 01:49:08.294]  These governments are so corrupt.
[01:49:08.615 --> 01:49:12.056]  I mean, they're always involved in all sorts of insundry activities and manipulation.
[01:49:12.416 --> 01:49:21.221]  How do we keep the human genome safe when the plant and animal genome is all being scrambled and human genes are being put in all these other animals right now?
[01:49:21.301 --> 01:49:22.081]  Can you comment on that?
[01:49:22.705 --> 01:49:25.706]  Well, there's no doubt that you have to have faith in the world today.
[01:49:25.786 --> 01:49:29.528]  Because, very simply, I think if we have no faith, we have no business in being here.
[01:49:29.988 --> 01:49:37.972]  Therefore, as a world citizen, I must tell you that I'm going to do anything in my power to see to it that this technology is not being abused.
[01:49:38.212 --> 01:49:39.833]  And that's the best that I can do.
[01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:49.857]  I can call George W. I can call on the world to obviously play with me and understand that this technology can be useful.
[01:49:50.903 --> 01:49:55.288]  Just like any technology, you know, a good example is the nuclear technology.
[01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:57.010]  The nuclear power technology.
[01:49:57.851 --> 01:50:03.438]  But at the same time, you know, there's the potential of abusing any technology, including the plain aspirin.
[01:50:04.261 --> 01:50:05.242]  I can point you to them.
[01:50:05.262 --> 01:50:05.923]  One last question.
[01:50:05.943 --> 01:50:10.327]  It's there and therefore we need to be aware of that and make all the measurements necessary.
[01:50:10.507 --> 01:50:11.328]  One last question.
[01:50:11.468 --> 01:50:11.669]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:11.869 --> 01:50:20.217]  In the Project for a New American Century document written by Dick Cheney and Remsfeld, they talk about bioweapons labs producing race-specific weapons and how this could be legitimate.
[01:50:20.678 --> 01:50:22.860]  I know you're a genetics expert and fertility expert.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:27.485]  Are you aware of the warnings that have been put out because of the development of race-specific bioweapons?
[01:50:28.462 --> 01:50:42.729]  Well, yes I am, and that worries the heck out of me, I must tell you, and therefore I think that, you know, as a scientist, I do walk a very fine line, but then of course my gut feeling is that we are not going to self-destruct.
[01:50:42.889 --> 01:50:52.454]  I think that we know better, I think the world is going to be a much safer place, and being an optimist, I was born to be an optimist, I must tell you that this world is going to hang in there for a long time to come.
[01:50:52.834 --> 01:50:53.475]  All right, Dr. Zavos,
[01:50:55.101 --> 01:50:57.244]  Just be careful and you need to pray about what you're doing.
[01:50:57.464 --> 01:50:58.005]  I do too.
[01:50:58.025 --> 01:50:58.866]  And take care.
[01:50:59.186 --> 01:51:07.836]  And if anybody wants to get on my website, all they have to do is go to www.zavoszavios.org and I thank you all.
[01:51:08.156 --> 01:51:09.518]  Alright, zavos.org, thank you.
[01:51:11.218 --> 01:51:14.401]  Well, you know, that guy, he came on, he told us the truth.
[01:51:14.441 --> 01:51:16.062]  He's pure New World Order, folks.
[01:51:16.242 --> 01:51:18.324]  You heard him, global citizen, all the rest of that.
[01:51:18.364 --> 01:51:20.245]  He knows all about the race-specific bioweapons.
[01:51:20.845 --> 01:51:22.186]  I hope you know about him now.
[01:51:22.427 --> 01:51:23.988]  I hope you know what's going on.
[01:51:24.408 --> 01:51:26.210]  We're not in Kansas anymore, folks.
[01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:27.130]  We're in 2003.
[01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:29.952]  Stop being naive about what's going on.
[01:51:30.093 --> 01:51:33.035]  I'll let you respond to what he was saying coming up in the next segment.
[01:51:33.495 --> 01:51:34.736]  No point being mean to that guy.
[01:51:34.756 --> 01:51:37.118]  He's just basically a mad scientist.
[01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:42.393]  And, uh, you know, means well, jumping up and down wildly about how he loves the New World Order, basically.
[01:51:43.333 --> 01:51:44.574]  Uh, just incredible.
[01:51:45.094 --> 01:51:46.955]  And this stuff is evil, folks.
[01:51:47.115 --> 01:51:47.856]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:51:49.336 --> 01:51:50.857]  But they're gonna say, oh, you can't stop it.
[01:51:50.957 --> 01:51:55.480]  And you got psychopaths in government that, you know, dwarf anything that Dr. Zabos has done, I guarantee you.
[01:51:56.826 --> 01:52:14.014]  Before we end this hour, if you believe in what we're doing and want to help us get the word out and fight the New World Order, get my videos, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design, the two books I offer, my book Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's great book, Order Out of Chaos.

[01:52:47.889 --> 01:52:50.050]  Third Hour, Your Calls, a bunch of other news straight ahead.
[01:52:54.105 --> 01:52:57.610]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:52:57.850 --> 01:53:01.355]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:53:01.435 --> 01:53:10.767]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed and... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.278 --> 01:53:19.919]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.599 --> 01:53:21.660]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.521]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.121 --> 01:53:24.942]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.682 --> 01:53:26.583]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.603 --> 01:53:31.026]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.446 --> 01:53:35.569]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:39.552]  We live in very interesting times.
[01:53:41.373 --> 01:53:42.194]  Last 30 minutes, I had Dr. P.M.
[01:53:42.214 --> 01:53:42.514]  Zabos
[01:53:46.343 --> 01:53:57.827]  PhD, top fertility doctor in the world, according to the new scientist, who's got his clones, his embryos on ice, of human beings, or are they human?
[01:53:58.467 --> 01:54:15.133]  These abominations, to be implanted copies of their parents, of one of the parents to be implanted, and this is not the Rayleigh and Colt getting attention, this guy's for real, and he's going to go forward with the implantation, he said, by the end of this year.
[01:54:16.639 --> 01:54:19.942]  So we'll have the first cloned human being on the scene walking around very soon.
[01:54:19.962 --> 01:54:21.683]  Of course, they're obviously already out there.
[01:54:21.904 --> 01:54:26.007]  Believe me, the globalists have been doing this in their government labs for a while.
[01:54:27.208 --> 01:54:28.930]  We don't talk enough about cloning on this show.
[01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:38.778]  You know, I mentioned race-specific bioweapons that Dick Cheney said he thinks is legitimate to develop that kill certain races in the PNAC document in 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[01:54:39.258 --> 01:54:41.020]  And Dr. Szabo said he was familiar with that.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.101]  It was very scary.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.962]  And I keep wanting to talk about race-specific bio-weapons that our Vice President says are legitimate to use.
[01:54:48.462 --> 01:54:49.062]  They've developed.
[01:54:49.402 --> 01:54:53.164]  And the three dozen Level 4 bio-weapons labs are building all across the country.
[01:54:53.684 --> 01:55:01.286]  Because this bio-attack is the crisis, is the New World Order's silver bullet that they're going to use to destroy liberty worldwide.
[01:55:02.627 --> 01:55:07.048]  They have genetic engineering technologies that are so advanced, it's hard to even imagine.
[01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:11.270]  And the clones are on the way, folks.
[01:55:12.256 --> 01:55:15.599]  Your chance to respond to it, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:15.739 --> 01:55:19.602]  It is open line Friday, 800-259-9231.
[01:55:20.542 --> 01:55:29.789]  Coming up, poverty rises, income down, census says, but size of government grows, as well as the profits of the Fortune 500.
[01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:33.412]  Government grows, Fortune 500 gets richer, the general public gets poorer.
[01:55:33.832 --> 01:55:34.673]  How does that work?
[01:55:34.953 --> 01:55:35.693]  We'll talk about it.
[01:55:36.594 --> 01:55:38.876]  Also, criticism of Patriot Act measure endorsed.
[01:55:39.036 --> 01:55:40.557]  Austin has thrown out the Patriot Act.
[01:55:41.303 --> 01:55:48.667]  Thanks for the great work of Austinites, and the local radio stations that carry this show, and all the great folks that showed up down there, and the pressure you brought to bear.
[01:55:48.687 --> 01:55:51.188]  I'll tell you more about my little run-in with the Deputy U.S.
[01:55:51.228 --> 01:55:51.568]  Attorney.
[01:55:52.288 --> 01:55:55.230]  Also, McClintock, the neocons want him out.
[01:55:55.290 --> 01:56:07.876]  They want Schwarzenegger, the gun-grabbing, abortion-promoting, open-border pimp, porno king, Mr. Mapplethorpe buddy, to be the man.
[01:56:07.896 --> 01:56:09.297]  They don't want a real conservative in there.
[01:56:10.518 --> 01:56:14.281]  And we'll get into Cheney's ties to Halliburton, more and more of that, and the scams coming out.
[01:56:14.681 --> 01:56:18.404]  Cheney said he's getting no money from Halliburton, and it comes out as tens of millions of dollars.
[01:56:19.725 --> 01:56:20.646]  So we'll get into that.
[01:56:20.666 --> 01:56:21.847]  And also, new gun control!
[01:56:21.947 --> 01:56:23.148]  NRA's endorsing it.
[01:56:24.489 --> 01:56:28.312]  If you've ever had any mental problem, ever had a misdemeanor, you won't be able to own guns.
[01:56:28.412 --> 01:56:30.213]  Massive crime database.
[01:56:31.034 --> 01:56:35.998]  And so, Our Lady of Peace Act is back, with Orrin Hatch and a bunch of Republicans endorsing it.
[01:56:37.131 --> 01:56:38.572]  Again, I'm not a Democrat here, folks.
[01:56:38.632 --> 01:56:42.335]  I'm just sick and tired of Republicans being worse than Bill Clinton and acting like they're good.
[01:56:42.355 --> 01:56:48.960]  When we get back, we'll go to Roger and David and others that are patiently holding.
[01:56:50.241 --> 01:56:56.105]  But I really do hope folks call in and talk about this cloning situation, because it's very serious.
[01:56:56.245 --> 01:57:00.609]  Also, Levi Strauss, North America, jeans no longer fit company.
[01:57:01.309 --> 01:57:02.870]  They're totally leaving the country.
[01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:04.772]  Now, again, you thought Naftogat was bad?
[01:57:04.832 --> 01:57:06.433]  It's going to get seven times worse.
[01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:09.411]  Seven times worse in high-tech alone.
[01:57:10.491 --> 01:57:14.133]  So you think that this new economy and the new world order has been great so far?
[01:57:14.453 --> 01:57:15.614]  You like globalism so far?
[01:57:15.654 --> 01:57:17.114]  There's a lot more where that came from.
[01:57:18.195 --> 01:57:20.396]  And so we'll be getting into that also.
[01:57:20.556 --> 01:57:33.782]  Israel, Air Force, grounds refuseniks, 27 reservist pilots, many of them combat veterans, are refusing to take part in what they call bombing and killing innocent civilians.
[01:57:34.685 --> 01:57:39.869]  I guess the ADL will call these, these, these, these Pontiacious Jews anti-Semitic.
[01:57:39.909 --> 01:57:42.091]  That'll, that'll be coming out any minute.
[01:57:42.131 --> 01:57:44.673]  But again, if you're a Nazi, they'll give you an endorsement if you're Arnold.
[01:57:46.154 --> 01:57:49.797]  Also, researchers overcome quark to clone rats.
[01:57:49.817 --> 01:57:51.498]  That's coming up too.
[01:57:52.831 --> 01:57:55.855]  It's a big, big third hour.
[01:57:56.115 --> 01:57:57.176]  Lined up, listeners.
[01:57:57.196 --> 01:58:00.560]  We've got 55 minutes and 15 seconds left, so stay with us.
[01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:06.087]  Again, the websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:58:06.527 --> 01:58:08.209]  Spread the word and check out the news.
[01:58:08.289 --> 01:58:09.451]  Updated daily.
[01:58:09.531 --> 01:58:10.272]  We'll be back.
[01:58:14.838 --> 01:58:19.183]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:58:19.383 --> 01:58:23.809]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:58:23.969 --> 01:58:28.314]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:29.715]  The New World Order.
[01:58:30.496 --> 01:58:31.417]  Panama.
[01:58:31.497 --> 01:58:35.719]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:58:35.779 --> 01:58:42.702]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:58:42.842 --> 01:58:44.923]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:58:45.223 --> 01:58:55.688]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:58:55.848 --> 01:58:58.569]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:59.910]  This is a two and a half hour video.
[01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:01.250]  Police Day 3 is for you!

[02:00:14.049 --> 02:00:19.351]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:00:19.551 --> 02:00:21.631]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:00:21.871 --> 02:00:28.933]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:00:29.113 --> 02:00:40.667]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.

[02:01:14.648 --> 02:01:19.693]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.073 --> 02:01:22.396]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:23.917 --> 02:01:27.320]  Alright my friends, eight minutes into the hour.
[02:01:28.121 --> 02:01:30.884]  Final hour today on this live Friday edition.
[02:01:31.565 --> 02:01:35.148]  As we blast out, as we radiate out on the AM and FM dials.
[02:01:35.188 --> 02:01:37.931]  Simulcasting on the internet and global shortwave.
[02:01:40.151 --> 02:01:48.198]  And let's go straight back to the calls, and I'll get more into the economy, more on more plant shutdowns, and the plunging dollar, as well as Dick Cheney's criminal activities.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.402]  Right now, let's go to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:53.422 --> 02:01:54.103]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:01:54.643 --> 02:01:55.804]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:01:56.304 --> 02:02:00.548]  I was bristling to ask Dr. Mengele, I mean, Zetos, I mean, Mengele.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.761]  Uh, with scientific specificity.
[02:02:04.141 --> 02:02:09.104]  Now, we've had perhaps true clones as far back as 30 years ago with those simple critters like frogs and such.
[02:02:09.124 --> 02:02:12.805]  Yeah, he really does, he really does fit the stereotype of the mad scientist.
[02:02:13.185 --> 02:02:16.867]  But nevertheless, uh... He looks like Bela Lugosi, too.
[02:02:17.527 --> 02:02:26.852]  Uh, well, I was really wanting to ask him, now, were the problems with the... You know what, I want to have him back up after he does the clone, and there's no point, but you hear all that New World Order talk, too, I'm sure.
[02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:27.632]  Yeah.
[02:02:28.257 --> 02:02:51.150]  Well, I very much wanted to ask him, given the unknown and potentially intractable problems as such with Dolly, what's he, he's not going to have any mental anguish if 15 or 20 years down the road the product of his, the fruits of his labor only begin to show the growth developmental or whatever other problems that are unknown.
[02:02:51.751 --> 02:02:53.952]  That's the problem, these cellular structures
[02:02:54.853 --> 02:03:02.376]  Developed in the eggs and the ovaries and in the sperm, in the male sexual organ, is new, is fresh.
[02:03:02.416 --> 02:03:04.417]  The DNA is very well sequenced.
[02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:11.079]  That's why older women have a higher degree of birth defects than their children, because their eggs are old.
[02:03:11.519 --> 02:03:13.460]  I mean, the DNA breaks down, folks.
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:15.501]  And so that's their problem.
[02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:17.621]  And he did dodge that, and he was running over me.
[02:03:17.722 --> 02:03:18.702]  Only this guy can do that.
[02:03:19.382 --> 02:03:22.204]  He's running over me, but I'm trying to get better about not running over folks.
[02:03:22.244 --> 02:03:26.387]  I could have jumped in on him, but I'm just trying to keep from doing that, Roger.
[02:03:26.547 --> 02:03:28.289]  Yeah, well, that's one of the problems.
[02:03:28.349 --> 02:03:31.291]  Of course, there's a whole slew of potentially unknown problems.
[02:03:31.331 --> 02:03:39.877]  Well, but the point is, he did dodge the point that these clones and a bunch of different animals act aggressive, act stupid, fall over, die young.
[02:03:40.919 --> 02:03:41.979]  And that's the facts.
[02:03:42.479 --> 02:03:43.159]  God bless, Alex.
[02:03:43.559 --> 02:03:44.380]  Anything else, Roger?
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:45.580]  No, that'll be all for now.
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:45.920]  God bless.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.440]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:49.000]  Let's talk to David in Michigan.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:49.741]  David, go ahead.
[02:03:50.001 --> 02:03:50.421]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:50.941 --> 02:03:51.381]  How you doing?
[02:03:51.521 --> 02:04:04.643]  You had him there when he said right off the bat there that 13 to 14 of the genes in the mitochondria or the ribosomal DNA aren't going to match the donor because they are specific to the egg.
[02:04:05.103 --> 02:04:07.184]  And by the way, the egg is a cow, folks.
[02:04:07.744 --> 02:04:09.064]  Forgot that little tidbit here.
[02:04:09.758 --> 02:04:12.741]  Well, if it's a cow egg, it wouldn't match at all.
[02:04:13.161 --> 02:04:14.643]  Sir, I got it right here.
[02:04:15.043 --> 02:04:16.584]  He's using a cow egg.
[02:04:17.305 --> 02:04:19.327]  Because it's bigger, easier to put stuff in.
[02:04:19.867 --> 02:04:29.776]  Well, they were showing the other night on NOVA, they were typing Neanderthals, and they had another show before that about Egyptian mummies, that they were typing the DNA from the mitochondrial DNA.
[02:04:30.957 --> 02:04:35.602]  So the mitochondrial DNA from a cow egg certainly wouldn't match a human being.
[02:04:38.154 --> 02:04:43.060]  So when you went to do a blood test, you see automatically that it wasn't the person that they were supposed to be trying to clone.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:48.427]  Well, he made that point, and he was saying it's 15 genes out of thousands of others, but still.
[02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:51.210]  That was just the ribosomal RNA.
[02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:54.695]  The mitochondria has several thousand genes itself.
[02:04:56.818 --> 02:04:57.579]  It's amazing.
[02:04:58.399 --> 02:04:59.560]  They're in the cytoplasm.
[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:01.461]  They're not in the nucleus to start with.
[02:05:01.762 --> 02:05:08.607]  Let's just say, I know more than the general public about biology, but that's not saying much.
[02:05:10.048 --> 02:05:14.171]  Well, I took several classes in genetics at the University of Michigan.
[02:05:14.911 --> 02:05:19.475]  One of the professors I had was one of the people that were studying biological warfare back in the 50s.
[02:05:19.535 --> 02:05:21.736]  Well, I'll tell you who's over all this.
[02:05:21.796 --> 02:05:22.057]  It's IBM.
[02:05:23.684 --> 02:05:25.808]  IBM's over every wicked thing you can imagine.
[02:05:25.848 --> 02:05:29.514]  Genetic engineering, the human genome, the implantable chips.
[02:05:30.736 --> 02:05:31.777]  They've got their fingers.
[02:05:31.837 --> 02:05:35.844]  Every time I find the bottom of the rat hole, there is IBM sitting there.
[02:05:37.352 --> 02:05:46.157]  Well, I'll tell you, if you really want to get a good dose of this, just pick yourself up a copy of Atlas Huxley's Brave New World, and you can really see just what they're trying to ram down our throats.
[02:05:46.217 --> 02:05:53.560]  Well, you know, did you hear me last year, I should re-air that, air the 49-minute speech of Aldous Huxley at Berkeley about two months before he died in 1962?
[02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:56.802]  Yeah, I've heard some of it, yeah.
[02:05:57.342 --> 02:06:01.404]  Well, I aired that, and he talked about, you know, this is what they're going to do.
[02:06:01.464 --> 02:06:06.307]  He said, already in 1961, I saw people with implantable chips in their brains.
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:09.582]  We're there and it's actually worse!
[02:06:32.412 --> 02:06:36.737]  Well, you just don't have the mass of arresting people and, you know, killing them for, you know, any reason.
[02:06:36.777 --> 02:06:38.358]  They just let us go around and gripe about it.
[02:06:38.378 --> 02:06:39.119]  They go, so what?
[02:06:39.139 --> 02:06:39.940]  We're going to keep doing it.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:46.206]  We have a higher number of per capita persons in prison in this country than they did in Stalinist Russia, Alex.
[02:06:46.266 --> 02:06:46.567]  They do.
[02:06:46.867 --> 02:06:48.288]  It's over 7 million right now.
[02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:51.712]  And a lot of the people that are in there are for manufactured crimes.
[02:06:52.236 --> 02:06:52.816]  Well, that's true.
[02:06:52.836 --> 02:06:57.797]  And the news two years ago, they had a Fed on CBS said, they'll be 33 million by 2020.
[02:06:58.337 --> 02:07:02.238]  Now I've seen them announce, no, they'll be 30 million by 2010.
[02:07:02.918 --> 02:07:08.059]  I mean, folks, the prison population was 1.3 million five years ago.
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:09.420]  It's over 7 million.
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:10.600]  That's the actual number.
[02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:11.240]  They say it's 5.5.
[02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:13.821]  No, no, it's 7 plus mil.
[02:07:15.141 --> 02:07:17.982]  And not only that, it costs probably 500,000 people running this.
[02:07:21.249 --> 02:07:22.329]  Oh, it's a lot more than $500,000.
[02:07:22.369 --> 02:07:24.330]  Just in prison guards.
[02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:25.270]  Yeah, just in prison guards.
[02:07:25.290 --> 02:07:26.971]  Then you've got the maintenance and all the rest of it.
[02:07:26.991 --> 02:07:29.832]  You've got the judges, you've got the lawyers, you've got the cops.
[02:07:29.872 --> 02:07:30.812]  But let's expand on that.
[02:07:30.832 --> 02:07:32.533]  A lot of good old boys went, good!
[02:07:33.033 --> 02:07:34.633]  Make them criminals work!
[02:07:34.754 --> 02:07:37.935]  Make them work in a shoe factory or a computer factory or furniture.
[02:07:38.395 --> 02:07:39.715]  Hey, folks!
[02:07:39.755 --> 02:07:40.355]  Let me stop you.
[02:07:40.856 --> 02:07:41.816]  Hey, folks!
[02:07:43.084 --> 02:07:46.107]  Where do you think your jobs are going if they're not going to China or Mexico?
[02:07:46.427 --> 02:07:50.230]  How are you going to compete against somebody on average getting 18, 20 cents an hour?
[02:07:50.490 --> 02:07:52.231]  You know, people just don't think this through.
[02:07:52.251 --> 02:07:58.076]  Well, this state here, they got them building office furniture and the people in Grand Rapids are upset about it.
[02:07:58.577 --> 02:07:59.017]  Well, good!
[02:07:59.057 --> 02:08:00.118]  People better wake up!
[02:08:00.178 --> 02:08:03.340]  Listen, did you know that the loggers aren't... It's a lie.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.003]  The loggers aren't losing their jobs because they won't let them cut down forest.
[02:08:07.023 --> 02:08:09.045]  The loggers are losing their jobs because I've had them on the show.
[02:08:09.085 --> 02:08:09.706]  I've talked to them.
[02:08:09.946 --> 02:08:11.427]  It's been in the news out there out west.
[02:08:12.088 --> 02:08:17.929]  They're losing their jobs because they're building prisons and then giant mills on the backs of them.
[02:08:18.429 --> 02:08:18.689]  Yeah!
[02:08:18.969 --> 02:08:20.910]  That's why you're losing your job, folks!
[02:08:22.290 --> 02:08:27.731]  I think I saw one article where like 70% of the mills in Oregon are prisons.
[02:08:27.791 --> 02:08:37.573]  I mean, how are you going to get $10 an hour to try to raise a family just barely squeezed by when there's somebody over here getting 20 cents an hour working in a mill?
[02:08:38.342 --> 02:08:42.566]  Well, you'd be liking that movie, Out of the Ice, with Willie Nelson, where he was showing the guy how to cook rat.
[02:08:42.586 --> 02:08:47.170]  So he could get enough strength to cut his daily quota up there in the Siberian forest.
[02:08:49.352 --> 02:08:49.693]  Yeah.
[02:08:51.034 --> 02:08:52.495]  I appreciate the call, Tick, here.
[02:08:52.676 --> 02:08:54.758]  I just... It's suicide, folks.
[02:08:54.778 --> 02:08:58.801]  You're just... And I hear these neocons on the radio, the idiot callers.
[02:08:59.462 --> 02:09:01.524]  I like mushroom balls and balls.
[02:09:01.564 --> 02:09:02.445]  Oh, you're good.
[02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:04.510]  Limbaugh, did you hear about these kooks?
[02:09:04.530 --> 02:09:05.651]  They think there's a world government.
[02:09:05.931 --> 02:09:07.452]  And they think Napkin Gatsby.
[02:09:10.434 --> 02:09:18.439]  The liberals, they don't like Schwarzenegger.
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:22.201]  Alright, is Lou in Rhode Island up next?
[02:09:25.678 --> 02:09:26.419]  Lou is gone.
[02:09:26.679 --> 02:09:29.341]  You know, Lou, I was about to go to you from Rhode Island up there.
[02:09:30.101 --> 02:09:31.382]  Let's talk to Tim in Canada.
[02:09:31.402 --> 02:09:32.223]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:09:32.243 --> 02:09:33.064]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:33.124 --> 02:09:33.984]  How are you today?
[02:09:34.505 --> 02:09:39.348]  Well, I'm just learning that I'm a communist because I'm pro-gun, pro-family, pro-border, pro-sovereignty.
[02:09:39.789 --> 02:09:51.418]  But I'm watching the Republican Party demand that McClintock step down so that Arne can win when he's as bad or worse than the racist kingpin, Bustamante.
[02:09:52.478 --> 02:09:54.320]  The man is pure evil.
[02:09:54.904 --> 02:09:56.404]  As far as I'm concerned.
[02:09:56.585 --> 02:10:01.506]  He's got nothing to do with me other than the fact that he's going to be part of the government of our largest neighbor.
[02:10:01.526 --> 02:10:05.207]  The fifth largest economy?
[02:10:05.227 --> 02:10:07.068]  He's going to be the governor of the fifth largest economy?
[02:10:07.308 --> 02:10:08.128]  Yes, in the world.
[02:10:09.588 --> 02:10:14.930]  I thought you did a really good job of staying away from that doctor.
[02:10:15.190 --> 02:10:19.051]  When he got into the New World Order stuff, I thought you were going to jump on him and you didn't.
[02:10:19.251 --> 02:10:21.892]  That was super because you never ever changed the guy's mind.
[02:10:22.872 --> 02:10:23.893]  He's nuts to begin with.
[02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:31.372]  No, I could tell talking to him that that guy is ramped up and he's mad scientist type.
[02:10:31.432 --> 02:10:33.293]  I've been around these type of researchers and folks.
[02:10:33.913 --> 02:10:39.475]  There's a lot of them here in Austin and they're smart guys but they're just so upbeat.
[02:10:39.495 --> 02:10:40.416]  They're just blind.
[02:10:40.436 --> 02:10:41.916]  He's just, I'm optimistic!
[02:10:42.716 --> 02:10:43.857]  Well I'm glad he is because
[02:10:44.787 --> 02:10:45.708]  I don't know where he's going.
[02:10:45.728 --> 02:10:46.688]  It's going to be awful warm.
[02:10:46.708 --> 02:10:50.131]  I wonder if he can invent some boots so he can dance around the fire without burning his feet.
[02:10:50.211 --> 02:10:51.812]  Well, I mean, this really is blasphemous.
[02:10:51.852 --> 02:10:54.274]  And look at all the horrible things that have come out of the genetic engineering.
[02:10:54.634 --> 02:10:56.035]  And there's no controls on it.
[02:10:56.335 --> 02:11:03.641]  Texas Company Protein Gene, Associated Press, 96 planting locations, pharmacological corn that grows HIV in the kernels.
[02:11:04.121 --> 02:11:05.322]  And it's spread into soybeans.
[02:11:05.602 --> 02:11:09.925]  Just back of the paper once, yeah, HIV growing plants everywhere.
[02:11:09.985 --> 02:11:10.886]  It's no big deal.
[02:11:10.926 --> 02:11:11.846]  Government's involved.
[02:11:12.507 --> 02:11:13.628]  That's just plants.
[02:11:14.508 --> 02:11:18.691]  Well, I tell you, I think we're barking up the wrong tree with this type of thing.
[02:11:19.331 --> 02:11:25.035]  God told us not to subdue the earth, but he did not tell us to mess around with creation.
[02:11:25.055 --> 02:11:26.596]  He said don't mix the seed.
[02:11:26.817 --> 02:11:27.437]  That's right.
[02:11:28.038 --> 02:11:41.547]  And I have a very strong suspicion that these creatures, whatever it is that comes out of this mixture of a cow egg and some sort of a cell from a human being, whatever they use, I'm not sure what that would be, but I would imagine that
[02:11:42.202 --> 02:11:44.544]  Well he also tried to compare a test tube baby
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:07.281]  That's completely different folks.
[02:12:07.321 --> 02:12:15.830]  That's just putting the egg and the sperm together and making sure it combines and forms a zygote and implanting it.
[02:12:16.593 --> 02:12:18.694]  I mean, I did that when I worked for a large animal vet.
[02:12:19.334 --> 02:12:22.075]  One day a week, you know, he had a big fancy lab.
[02:12:22.115 --> 02:12:25.817]  They bring in the champion bulls and cows and I have to assist.
[02:12:25.897 --> 02:12:27.217]  That is nothing.
[02:12:27.237 --> 02:12:32.219]  That's like taking the pollen off a flower and cross pollinating it on another flower with your finger.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:36.621]  That is not blasphemous and just out of control.
[02:12:36.661 --> 02:12:37.862]  And he tried to compare it to that.
[02:12:38.622 --> 02:12:45.505]  No comparison whatsoever because you're taking a process which basically God ordained the process.
[02:12:46.164 --> 02:12:47.044]  Well that's it, Tim.
[02:12:47.064 --> 02:12:47.745]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:47.765 --> 02:12:48.505]  More calls coming up.
[02:12:48.765 --> 02:12:51.346]  Your chance to get involved on air on this live Friday edition.
[02:12:51.366 --> 02:12:51.426]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:51.446 --> 02:12:52.727]  A blog about the Patriot Act here in Austin, too.
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:22.023]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:13:22.424 --> 02:13:25.166]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:13:25.606 --> 02:13:28.488]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:13:28.868 --> 02:13:35.993]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:13:36.513 --> 02:13:37.414]  That's recovery?
[02:13:38.014 --> 02:13:43.218]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:13:43.618 --> 02:13:45.159]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?

[02:16:14.284 --> 02:16:16.586]  Hi, my name is Donald from TheGoldenAnswer.com.

[02:16:20.869 --> 02:16:23.271]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[02:16:23.592 --> 02:16:26.114]  Many of you want to acquire gold, but you can't afford it.
[02:16:26.294 --> 02:16:31.458]  TheGoldenAnswer.com is a private club and our members acquire gold at 40 cents on the dollar.

[02:16:50.232 --> 02:16:54.495]  The balance is paid off by getting five other people into the club and to open a contract.

[02:17:16.156 --> 02:17:21.319]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:24.281]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:17:44.034 --> 02:17:45.795]  Alright, let's go straight back to the calls.
[02:17:45.855 --> 02:17:49.037]  Let's talk to Phil in Nebraska, then Katie in Tennessee, and others.
[02:17:49.358 --> 02:17:49.898]  Welcome, Phil.
[02:17:49.938 --> 02:17:51.379]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:17:51.579 --> 02:17:51.879]  Good.
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:53.940]  Hey, illegal immigration.
[02:17:56.002 --> 02:18:07.029]  There is over a thousand illegals going to Washington, D.C., and then they're going to go up to New York City, to Liberty State Park.
[02:18:07.489 --> 02:18:08.710]  They're going by bus.
[02:18:10.391 --> 02:18:12.032]  And they're going to protest for
[02:18:13.354 --> 02:18:14.174]  Immigrant rights!
[02:18:14.474 --> 02:18:23.396]  No, I know, they have immigrant rights rallies with thousands all the time in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and their people committing federal crimes just right out in the open!
[02:18:23.776 --> 02:18:34.858]  Now, they're going to be gathering at Liberty State Park, with the background being the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, next Friday.
[02:18:36.359 --> 02:18:38.319]  And, there's a counter-protest.
[02:18:40.656 --> 02:18:43.538]  Uh, at 1pm in Liberty State Park.
[02:18:44.718 --> 02:18:46.879]  Do you want the internet information on this?
[02:18:47.139 --> 02:18:47.800]  Well, yeah.
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:50.801]  I would imagine that American Patrol is reporting on that, aren't they?
[02:18:51.722 --> 02:18:52.222]  I doubt it.
[02:18:52.982 --> 02:18:54.443]  Uh, this is being organized.
[02:18:54.543 --> 02:18:55.824]  I'll give you the internet site.
[02:18:57.064 --> 02:19:00.306]  HalTurnerShow.com Flash I W F R
[02:19:07.626 --> 02:19:11.647]  Well, I'd imagine if they go to the general website, they'll see it right there.
[02:19:11.667 --> 02:19:14.487]  Yeah, they'll find it at howturnershow.com.
[02:19:14.527 --> 02:19:15.547]  You ought to have him on!
[02:19:16.087 --> 02:19:23.969]  Because, you know, I mean, these people, Jim McGreevey, the governor of New Jersey, is going to be there in support of these illegals.
[02:19:24.869 --> 02:19:28.490]  You know, they're lobbying Congress, they're right out in the open breaking the law, Alex.
[02:19:28.510 --> 02:19:30.250]  Well, look, let me just say something, Phil.
[02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:36.751]  The illegals, whether they're Russian or Mexican or Easter bunnies, don't have any power.
[02:19:38.183 --> 02:19:47.152]  The establishment wants to break America down, wants to destroy the middle class, wants to turn us into a third world country, and that's why the Republicans and the Democrats are both doing this.
[02:19:47.572 --> 02:19:53.358]  That's why they said the layoffs are going to get seven times worse, according to Scripps Howard News Service, and the federal government's own admission.
[02:19:54.466 --> 02:20:00.232]  That's why Boeing and IBM and Dell and Levi Strauss and everything else is leaving.
[02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:09.581]  And until these yuppies figure that out, until we stop listening to these lying neocons that tell us gun control is conservative and all this trash and tell us that
[02:20:11.219 --> 02:20:16.003]  You know, hardcore homosexual porn is a Christian conservative thing.
[02:20:17.043 --> 02:20:21.206]  Until we wake up from that, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:20:21.487 --> 02:20:26.570]  Well, let me just go to... I live in Omaha, Alex.
[02:20:27.451 --> 02:20:33.735]  I used to live in a town called Grand Island, Nebraska, about 150 miles west of Omaha.
[02:20:34.476 --> 02:20:38.879]  They had a swearing-in ceremony for new citizens the day before yesterday.
[02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:46.354]  In 10 languages, none, I repeat, none of the new citizens were white.
[02:20:47.494 --> 02:20:51.556]  So what they're doing is they're demographically changing the entire country.
[02:20:52.497 --> 02:20:56.579]  These Jewish neocons, I call them the Kosher Nostra.
[02:20:57.159 --> 02:21:07.525]  And the reason I call them the Kosher Nostra is because they're Trotskyites, same guys that did the Bolshevik Revolution, same ideology,
[02:21:08.112 --> 02:21:09.772]  And they're largely Jewish.
[02:21:10.592 --> 02:21:11.433]  And they're Zionist.
[02:21:11.933 --> 02:21:12.653]  It's amazing.
[02:21:13.373 --> 02:21:19.954]  And people just sit there and they just... They just have no idea what's going on.
[02:21:20.374 --> 02:21:25.195]  And as far as these computer people losing their jobs, that's a good deal.
[02:21:25.255 --> 02:21:26.895]  You wanna know why, Alex?
[02:21:28.956 --> 02:21:29.316]  You there?
[02:21:29.716 --> 02:21:30.816]  Yeah, I'm listening to ya!
[02:21:31.096 --> 02:21:34.937]  That's a good deal because they didn't give a hoot.
[02:21:35.914 --> 02:21:44.181]  About the $10 or $12 an hour guy, or $10 to $12 an hour guy losing his job when the jobs were going to Mexico.
[02:21:44.782 --> 02:21:46.123]  These people deserve it.
[02:21:46.644 --> 02:21:54.110]  Because they're making $80,000 to $120,000 a year when the $10, $12, $15 an hour guy lost his job.
[02:21:54.891 --> 02:21:57.834]  They've said, great, our 401k will keep increasing.
[02:21:58.334 --> 02:21:59.795]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:21:59.855 --> 02:22:00.576]  I appreciate it.
[02:22:01.277 --> 02:22:02.738]  And yes, I was there listening to you.
[02:22:03.805 --> 02:22:10.210]  Look, folks, this whole fetish of, it's all the Jews doing everything, defeats the purpose of fighting tyranny.
[02:22:11.591 --> 02:22:13.312]  Did the Jews run communist China?
[02:22:15.334 --> 02:22:17.475]  Let me ask you this, the UN is against Israel.
[02:22:17.636 --> 02:22:24.801]  The UN is totally evil, murders people all over the planet, masquerades around like the good guy, and they're against the state of Israel.
[02:22:26.342 --> 02:22:27.363]  How do you square with that?
[02:22:27.403 --> 02:22:28.444]  How do you square?
[02:22:28.464 --> 02:22:31.526]  How do the white supremacists out there square
[02:22:32.702 --> 02:22:38.311]  With the United Nations being against Israel.
[02:22:39.753 --> 02:22:43.859]  How do you square with all the dirty leftists who are so against Israel?
[02:22:44.721 --> 02:22:46.083]  How do you square being with them?
[02:22:46.747 --> 02:22:48.128]  Now understand, I don't like Israel.
[02:22:48.388 --> 02:22:49.848]  I don't like what their corrupt government's doing.
[02:22:50.048 --> 02:22:51.129]  I don't like what Mossad's doing.
[02:22:51.549 --> 02:22:53.449]  They're corrupt like all these other governments.
[02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:57.871]  The point is, you've got to be more sophisticated in your view if you're going to understand this.
[02:22:58.531 --> 02:23:00.532]  Let me try to explain it when we get back, okay?
[02:23:00.932 --> 02:23:01.993]  It just really gets old.
[02:23:02.033 --> 02:23:02.513]  We'll be back.
[02:23:04.313 --> 02:23:05.254]  We're on the march.
[02:23:05.694 --> 02:23:07.314]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.235 --> 02:23:10.916]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.117 --> 02:23:16.138]  What would you rather do?
[02:23:16.499 --> 02:23:19.402]  Spend 10 minutes learning how to become debt free within two years?
[02:23:19.682 --> 02:23:21.944]  Or spend the next 30 years wishing you had?
[02:23:21.964 --> 02:23:25.989]  The debt experts at startovertoday.com can usually settle your debt for you.
[02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:28.291]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the Ark Institute.
[02:23:28.351 --> 02:23:28.411]  P.O.
[02:23:28.491 --> 02:23:29.132]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[02:23:40.851 --> 02:23:46.134]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:47.834 --> 02:24:05.263]  You know, studying the New World Order, as I've done, I've found out that the Masonic Movement is controlled by the New World Order, the Nazi Movement, the Machiavelli, racist Hispanic groups, the racist black groups, and they all lead back to the same people, the same organizations.
[02:24:07.922 --> 02:24:18.969]  And when you look at the Nazi Party, deep occultism, pool society, funded and financed by the Rothschilds and others.
[02:24:20.329 --> 02:24:24.152]  Again, creating these bogeymen to then create a crisis that brings us into world government.
[02:24:25.232 --> 02:24:28.614]  Take the Patriot Act meeting last night where the City Council voted down the Patriot Act.
[02:24:29.835 --> 02:24:32.637]  It was mainly my listeners there, great folks, my viewers.
[02:24:33.297 --> 02:24:34.518]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them.
[02:24:37.142 --> 02:24:45.971]  Over a hundred signed up to speak, and they were black, they were white, they were Hispanic, they were old, they were young, they were German immigrants, they were, you know, Wyoshin immigrants that were there.
[02:24:47.112 --> 02:24:50.035]  Folks with the, you know, the Eastern accents, folks with the German accents.
[02:24:50.055 --> 02:24:50.895]  A lot of great people.
[02:24:52.597 --> 02:25:01.566]  And see, I can get on the air and I can say, we gotta deport the illegals, we gotta shut the border down, this is wrong, and my biggest listeners in Austin, frankly, are Hispanics.
[02:25:02.404 --> 02:25:07.266]  I mean, that's the biggest viewers and listeners of the show, and they're the biggest fans who are out there involved.
[02:25:08.047 --> 02:25:19.412]  They understand, I'm not against people because they're Hispanic, I'm against a giant third world horde that'll work for absolutely nothing, pouring across, it'll destroy our standard of living, which the globalists want so they can control us.
[02:25:19.672 --> 02:25:20.852]  I'm against prison labor!
[02:25:21.533 --> 02:25:26.395]  Because it's a dangerous trend, number one, with what governments have done in the past, but also because it drives down our wages.
[02:25:28.064 --> 02:25:33.549]  And I'm able to cross those lines to neutralize the vulcanization.
[02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:37.033]  Like a guy called earlier and he said, I was anti-gun, I was a liberal.
[02:25:37.053 --> 02:25:38.294]  But after listening to you, I'm not.
[02:25:38.654 --> 02:25:39.655]  Because you're not a hypocrite.
[02:25:39.675 --> 02:25:41.077]  You exposed Bush and Clinton.
[02:25:42.678 --> 02:25:45.821]  See, I mean, I'm a populist constitutionalist.
[02:25:46.161 --> 02:25:48.403]  I believe what Thomas Jefferson believed in.
[02:25:49.264 --> 02:25:50.666]  And I know we can win this fight.
[02:25:50.706 --> 02:25:53.048]  I mean, I believe in having a free society.
[02:25:54.272 --> 02:26:01.214]  I mean, you tell somebody, you tell one of these immigrants, hey, there's a six and a half million people, a hundred plus million new births every year.
[02:26:02.475 --> 02:26:03.635]  They're all coming this way.
[02:26:03.655 --> 02:26:07.777]  20 million new births every year in Latin America alone.
[02:26:08.097 --> 02:26:09.317]  Can we handle that many?
[02:26:09.457 --> 02:26:19.261]  Because they're building super highways down there, they're building factories in Mexico to suck everybody up from south of the border there, then stage it, bring them in here, legalize it, take their ID cards.
[02:26:19.661 --> 02:26:22.642]  Folks, there's 30 million illegal aliens in this country.
[02:26:24.267 --> 02:26:28.871]  Most of the coastal cities are over half populations that weren't even born here.
[02:26:29.171 --> 02:26:31.073]  And that's on the census!
[02:26:31.253 --> 02:26:33.115]  Most of these illegals don't go on the census.
[02:26:33.755 --> 02:26:35.557]  The numbers are far worse than even we know.
[02:26:37.298 --> 02:26:38.639]  And you're seeing the response.
[02:26:38.659 --> 02:26:40.141]  You're seeing the effect of it.
[02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:43.023]  You're seeing the economy fall apart.
[02:26:44.484 --> 02:26:45.665]  So how many are we going to take?
[02:26:45.685 --> 02:26:46.146]  20 million more?
[02:26:46.166 --> 02:26:46.646]  40 million more?
[02:26:47.147 --> 02:26:47.547]  100 million more?
[02:26:50.549 --> 02:26:53.350]  No, this borderless, New World Order, global system?
[02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:54.550]  Have you been to Mexico City?
[02:26:54.890 --> 02:26:55.411]  I have!
[02:26:57.071 --> 02:27:02.293]  There are giant sludge pools, giant... the rivers look like black yogurt.
[02:27:02.773 --> 02:27:03.393]  I'm not kidding.
[02:27:03.833 --> 02:27:05.914]  One hour in a day, water comes out of a faucet.
[02:27:06.174 --> 02:27:11.236]  Half the population of 30 million lives in cardboard boxes.
[02:27:12.455 --> 02:27:26.833]  And about, what is it, 20% of the children are born without brains, that is, their upper brain is gone, it's just masses of deformed children, toxic waste, the human waste, the feces, turns into black clouds that clogs the lungs.
[02:27:27.213 --> 02:27:30.878]  It is hell on earth, a scene out of Blade Runner.
[02:27:34.073 --> 02:27:34.853]  The globalists love it!
[02:27:35.054 --> 02:27:42.918]  I've got the policy reports by Kissinger, where they want to, you know, carry all this out and turn us all into a big third world system to control us, dumb us down so we don't resist.
[02:27:42.958 --> 02:27:44.018]  I mean, this is all on the record!
[02:27:45.099 --> 02:27:55.364]  Now, you tell a black person, or a white person, or a Jewish person, or a Chinese person, you tell them that, and they look around, they know it's the truth, they'll join you in liberty and freedom!
[02:27:57.806 --> 02:27:58.546]  But, uh,
[02:27:59.441 --> 02:28:03.223]  No, so we decry the Arnold Schwarzeneggers and the Bustamante's of the world.
[02:28:03.263 --> 02:28:04.723]  We show you they're not giving us a choice.
[02:28:05.464 --> 02:28:07.624]  Folks, they're giving us a choice on a controlled paradigm.
[02:28:08.825 --> 02:28:13.587]  And to just always say, you know, it's the Zionists, it's the Jews that run everything.
[02:28:13.627 --> 02:28:14.947]  I'm sorry folks, it's not true.
[02:28:15.568 --> 02:28:20.250]  Yeah, you've got a lot of Jews in the New World Order, you've got a lot of Germans, a lot of Dutch, a lot of royalty.
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:25.692]  And what they are is they're smart, cunning, rich people that have combined their forces to be slave masters.
[02:28:25.852 --> 02:28:26.652]  They're evil people!
[02:28:28.053 --> 02:28:28.293]  Okay?
[02:28:29.418 --> 02:28:31.099]  The Oppenheimers are evil people.
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:33.661]  Not because they're Jewish, but because they're evil.
[02:28:33.781 --> 02:28:34.481]  They're a cultist.
[02:28:35.842 --> 02:28:37.583]  The Rockefellers are evil.
[02:28:37.783 --> 02:28:40.385]  Not because they're Presbyterian, but because they're evil.
[02:28:41.766 --> 02:28:44.307]  The Saxe-Coburg-Gothic, you know her as Queen Elizabeth.
[02:28:45.368 --> 02:28:47.449]  She is not evil because she's German.
[02:28:47.489 --> 02:28:50.391]  She's evil because she engages in evil activities.
[02:28:51.354 --> 02:28:53.595]  And so we just cut through all that and fight the evil?
[02:28:53.796 --> 02:28:55.096]  This is all a big destruction!
[02:28:55.136 --> 02:29:00.180]  Yeah, they brought in all these people to balkanize us, so we're a tower of babble that can't communicate with each other.
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:01.340]  Yes, that's true, Collar.
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:02.401]  That's right, Phil.
[02:29:02.741 --> 02:29:03.962]  That part of what you said is true.
[02:29:04.462 --> 02:29:05.983]  But we don't have to play into that.
[02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:12.287]  Look, 87% of Americans want the borders shut and the illegals deported.
[02:29:12.327 --> 02:29:13.168]  I've seen all the big polls.
[02:29:13.508 --> 02:29:15.950]  When they come out, they don't publicize them because they don't like the results.
[02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:17.230]  Now, wait.
[02:29:17.571 --> 02:29:19.732]  That's the majority of Hispanics, of blacks, of whites.
[02:29:20.493 --> 02:29:20.973]  Evasions?
[02:29:21.153 --> 02:29:22.373]  People aren't stupid!
[02:29:22.393 --> 02:29:26.654]  The media keeps this line going that it's racial, racial, racial!
[02:29:28.615 --> 02:29:29.575]  It's amazing, folks.
[02:29:29.695 --> 02:29:32.055]  We do not have to play in their game, okay?
[02:29:32.135 --> 02:29:36.676]  You do not have to go along their psychological debates and parameters and go off their script.
[02:29:37.496 --> 02:29:42.857]  You can circumnavigate that and cut them off at the pass and just expose the whole rotten system!
[02:29:44.758 --> 02:29:47.078]  And yes, there's a current servant elite up there.
[02:29:49.201 --> 02:29:53.725]  You know, where Clinton's administration was dominated by communist Chinese spies and scams.
[02:29:53.765 --> 02:29:57.108]  This administration is dominated by Trotskyites and Zionists and people.
[02:29:57.789 --> 02:29:58.990]  And we can just address it.
[02:29:59.070 --> 02:30:00.471]  I mean, that's being addressed.
[02:30:02.253 --> 02:30:03.314]  But again, they're just tools.
[02:30:03.354 --> 02:30:07.238]  People act like it's the neocons that developed the New World Order and run it and they created it.
[02:30:07.318 --> 02:30:07.838]  No, they didn't.
[02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:10.621]  Cecil Rhodes didn't create it a hundred years ago.
[02:30:10.641 --> 02:30:12.503]  This is just empire, folks.
[02:30:12.543 --> 02:30:13.844]  A synthesis of wickedness.
[02:30:16.106 --> 02:30:18.027]  And so, we need to understand it.
[02:30:18.047 --> 02:30:18.947]  That's what I was trying to say.
[02:30:19.187 --> 02:30:20.088]  Katie in Tennessee.
[02:30:20.128 --> 02:30:20.788]  Katie, go ahead.
[02:30:21.668 --> 02:30:23.789]  Hey, I had a question for you.
[02:30:25.470 --> 02:30:27.251]  You speak the truth.
[02:30:28.411 --> 02:30:31.532]  One thing is, can I say a celebrity's name on the air?
[02:30:32.513 --> 02:30:32.773]  Sure.
[02:30:33.473 --> 02:30:39.255]  Okay, if you listen to Rush Limbaugh, he says you're not a patriot if you don't believe in this Patriot Act.
[02:30:39.576 --> 02:30:40.636]  You're not a good American, rather.
[02:30:41.218 --> 02:30:42.399]  And I'm a good American.
[02:30:42.459 --> 02:30:43.280]  So what do I say?
[02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:46.063]  I mean, what's a good comeback when they say we're not?
[02:30:46.503 --> 02:30:48.145]  Well, I mean, that's what Hitler said.
[02:30:48.185 --> 02:30:49.607]  You're either with us or you're against us.
[02:30:49.627 --> 02:30:51.769]  You're not a patriot if you disagree with something.
[02:30:51.969 --> 02:30:54.972]  And you're telling me Limbaugh says the Patriot Act is good?
[02:30:54.992 --> 02:30:59.336]  I think that he wants support for
[02:31:01.667 --> 02:31:04.689]  Well, now, I may not be right on that, but I know... Well, I've heard him.
[02:31:04.729 --> 02:31:05.930]  I'm just trying to see what you heard.
[02:31:06.151 --> 02:31:10.874]  Yeah, well, last night I heard another real conservative, because I drive a lot and I listen to Mark Fagin.
[02:31:10.935 --> 02:31:12.055]  They're not conservatives.
[02:31:12.256 --> 02:31:14.698]  They're telling McClintock to step down.
[02:31:15.258 --> 02:31:18.100]  They're going to sign a gun bill, the most draconian ever seen.
[02:31:18.881 --> 02:31:20.542]  They're open borders.
[02:31:20.582 --> 02:31:21.683]  They're not conservatives.
[02:31:21.723 --> 02:31:22.284]  That's the point.
[02:31:22.304 --> 02:31:27.248]  Look, Limbaugh... How many times have you heard Limbaugh say, if someone believes in a new world order,
[02:31:28.008 --> 02:31:28.529]  They're a kook.
[02:31:28.549 --> 02:31:29.209]  It doesn't exist.
[02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:31.491]  Well, now they announce it every day on the news.
[02:31:32.051 --> 02:31:33.412]  Our Supreme Court's under U.N.
[02:31:33.472 --> 02:31:36.154]  control, but still he tells you it's not real, it's not real.
[02:31:36.174 --> 02:31:43.159]  You know, it's like when enemies are busting down the gate, Limbaugh's up there with a bullhorn going, go back to sleep, it's not an attack, it's not an attack, lay down!
[02:31:43.379 --> 02:31:44.600]  He's an enemy agent!
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:46.842]  His books are published by the CFR!
[02:31:47.563 --> 02:31:52.785]  Well, this guy last night called Jimmy Carter a red, a commie, for saying that he was against the Patriot Act.
[02:31:52.905 --> 02:31:54.686]  But see, that's the theater.
[02:31:54.966 --> 02:31:56.146]  And Jimmy Carter's not a red.
[02:31:56.166 --> 02:31:59.207]  He's an elitist with Brzezinski who called for a new world order.
[02:31:59.527 --> 02:32:00.388]  Let me tell you what's going on.
[02:32:01.328 --> 02:32:02.629]  It's a set-piece battle.
[02:32:02.769 --> 02:32:06.310]  America knows that the liberals and the Democrats are a bunch of control freak elitists.
[02:32:07.188 --> 02:32:08.309]  Okay, but so are the Republicans.
[02:32:08.329 --> 02:32:09.330]  They're all on the same team.
[02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:12.072]  But they have these stage-set fake battles.
[02:32:12.092 --> 02:32:15.814]  Have you ever heard of the confidence game that Carnival Barkers will use?
[02:32:17.236 --> 02:32:21.959]  Where one guy will argue with the other one, and then they'll play good cop, bad cop, and then manipulate?
[02:32:22.059 --> 02:32:23.040]  It's a fun clown.
[02:32:24.113 --> 02:32:24.313]  Yeah.
[02:32:24.353 --> 02:32:25.414]  Like a flim flam.
[02:32:25.574 --> 02:32:26.215]  Yeah, a flim flam.
[02:32:26.235 --> 02:32:27.416]  That's all they're doing.
[02:32:27.717 --> 02:32:29.678]  Can't we figure that out?
[02:32:29.739 --> 02:32:30.539]  That's all it is.
[02:32:30.559 --> 02:32:32.221]  Oh look, Hillary's against this.
[02:32:32.461 --> 02:32:34.984]  Oh, we better be for it.
[02:32:35.024 --> 02:32:36.305]  It's a dog and pony show.
[02:32:38.403 --> 02:32:39.183]  So what do I say?
[02:32:39.684 --> 02:32:41.364]  I just say, look, I am pro.
[02:32:41.784 --> 02:32:42.144]  I am pro.
[02:32:42.164 --> 02:32:43.005]  This is what you say.
[02:32:43.345 --> 02:32:44.885]  Bush says he'll sign the insolvence ban.
[02:32:44.905 --> 02:32:45.746]  He's for open borders.
[02:32:46.026 --> 02:32:47.426]  He's signed campaign finance reform.
[02:32:47.446 --> 02:32:48.467]  Returning to the First Amendment.
[02:32:48.687 --> 02:32:50.087]  He's blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[02:32:50.287 --> 02:32:51.248]  Protecting Bill Clinton.
[02:32:51.568 --> 02:32:53.308]  He's giving supercomputers to Communist China.
[02:32:53.368 --> 02:32:54.009]  Now, hold on!
[02:32:55.149 --> 02:33:01.992]  The host will say, let's cover one issue at a time, let's, well, they'll go, no, don't try that with me!
[02:33:02.012 --> 02:33:12.375]  No, all you guys are, you're a bunch of neocons, the government's grown at record levels, you're here to compromise and co-opt the conservative movement in this country, and you're pathetic!
[02:33:12.855 --> 02:33:13.836]  And that's what you tell them.
[02:33:14.296 --> 02:33:16.117]  Okay, thank you.
[02:33:17.537 --> 02:33:17.977]  Isn't that it?
[02:33:19.098 --> 02:33:20.398]  Good to hear from you, appreciate the call.
[02:33:20.418 --> 02:33:22.439]  Let's talk to Justin in Minnesota, go ahead.
[02:33:23.291 --> 02:33:26.336]  Alex, I would just like to bring up a few points.
[02:33:26.576 --> 02:33:36.051]  First of all, if there's any of these kind of people listening, you know, that we're talking about, I just want to remind them how they are being used by what ends up being
[02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:41.971]  When you trace it all the way down, Lucifer himself, and he wants to destroy everyone, so they're going to go along with him.
[02:33:42.151 --> 02:33:43.372]  In the end, that's what they mean.
[02:33:43.692 --> 02:33:48.676]  Well, I know I turned Sean Hannity on, he's going, every child needs a chip, it's great, invest in it, invest in it.
[02:33:48.936 --> 02:33:49.137]  Yeah.
[02:33:49.177 --> 02:33:53.300]  I turn on another channel, and they're saying, world government's good, it's the conservative thing.
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:56.082]  I mean, it's just, and people go, it's conservative!
[02:33:56.702 --> 02:34:00.445]  I had a few things I just wanted to mention real quickly, a couple ideas I had.
[02:34:00.505 --> 02:34:02.307]  First of all, I expect to see a
[02:34:03.661 --> 02:34:07.764]  Identity theft has become a more and more and more publicized issue.
[02:34:07.904 --> 02:34:09.905]  Well they have been doing that in the past.
[02:34:10.365 --> 02:34:14.868]  Probably even perpetrated by the government just to get the people scared.
[02:34:15.028 --> 02:34:22.493]  Well actually the government has been caught releasing tens of thousands, and in many different cases, of social security numbers given to private corporations.
[02:34:22.513 --> 02:34:25.375]  Look, they create this number, they create this system,
[02:34:26.141 --> 02:34:28.603]  The guy that was on, he called a few calls ago,
[02:34:54.062 --> 02:35:03.966]  He mentioned a guy named Hal Turner, and I think Hal Turner is not somebody you want to associate the Freedom Movement, the Patriot Movement, with.
[02:35:04.407 --> 02:35:05.947]  I don't even know who he is.
[02:35:06.007 --> 02:35:07.148]  He's a total racist.
[02:35:07.228 --> 02:35:07.808]  He's a bigot.
[02:35:08.228 --> 02:35:22.715]  I do look at his site every day because he does have news that you're not going to find splattered all over other pages, but he's... Well, you know, a lot of these guys, they see the racism, all these white guys see the racism, the tribalism, the hatred of whites,
[02:35:23.388 --> 02:35:26.210]  And they hear the media saying that's a good thing, and that makes me angry too.
[02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:31.933]  But I'm not gonna like, join it, and then feed into it, that's how the globalists win.
[02:35:31.953 --> 02:35:47.222]  I'm gonna point out that the pimps of power are pulling all our strings with this, and show that multiculturalism is racism, meant to destroy all of our cultures, and when you tell people that, they understand, and then we can all come together and have liberty and freedom.
[02:35:47.242 --> 02:35:49.704]  But I don't wanna talk about other talk show hosts all day on my show.
[02:35:49.824 --> 02:35:52.352]  Yeah, I just wanted to mention that.
[02:35:52.453 --> 02:35:55.322]  I have to talk about Limbaugh because he's so powerful
[02:35:56.190 --> 02:36:06.494]  And I didn't know this for years, I bit my tongue, but when he says there isn't a new world order, the Patriot Act's good, gun control's not so bad, and when I hear that, man, that's it.
[02:36:06.574 --> 02:36:07.135]  I'm sick of it.
[02:36:07.155 --> 02:36:08.175]  I'm not going along with it.
[02:36:08.395 --> 02:36:08.615]  Right.
[02:36:08.755 --> 02:36:08.955]  Yeah.
[02:36:09.075 --> 02:36:12.177]  I mean, we have to support, you know, ideals of America.
[02:36:12.257 --> 02:36:13.377]  That is, people's rights.
[02:36:13.717 --> 02:36:14.177]  Exactly.
[02:36:14.217 --> 02:36:16.819]  They're giant pacifiers that manipulate us.
[02:36:17.259 --> 02:36:22.661]  And the very last thing I wanted to bring up, I've heard rumors of a superhighway in China that's
[02:36:23.263 --> 02:36:26.729]  Headed towards the Middle East, and I was wondering if you had ever heard anything about that.
[02:36:27.757 --> 02:36:28.437]  Oh, rumors?
[02:36:28.457 --> 02:36:35.939]  I mean, how is a superhighway in China have to go over Pakistan and Afghanistan and then through Iran?
[02:36:36.679 --> 02:36:39.660]  And, you know, you've got all these guys who don't even read the newspaper.
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:44.741]  They just sit up there and make stuff up on the radio and talk about the end of the world every five seconds.
[02:36:44.801 --> 02:36:46.462]  But that's what that sounds like to me.
[02:36:46.482 --> 02:36:48.722]  I mean, there's superhighways being built everywhere.
[02:36:49.162 --> 02:36:54.324]  I know they're building a trans-Siberian railway linking Europe, Russia and China right now.
[02:36:54.344 --> 02:36:55.764]  That's maybe what I...
[02:36:56.314 --> 02:36:57.216]  What I was hearing then.
[02:36:57.396 --> 02:36:58.097]  I was just curious.
[02:36:58.337 --> 02:36:59.439]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:36:59.459 --> 02:37:00.741]  Appreciate it.
[02:37:00.782 --> 02:37:03.686]  Let's talk to... I don't know.
[02:37:03.726 --> 02:37:04.868]  Who's up next here, guys?
[02:37:06.651 --> 02:37:07.553]  Nancy in Maryland.
[02:37:07.593 --> 02:37:07.974]  Go ahead.
[02:37:08.519 --> 02:37:09.320]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:10.740]  It's really nice to talk to you.
[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:13.842]  You do a great job, and I enjoy listening to your show.
[02:37:13.962 --> 02:37:16.424]  And actually, you took the steam out of what I wanted to say.
[02:37:16.464 --> 02:37:19.526]  You always do, because you always say it so much better than anybody else.
[02:37:19.586 --> 02:37:22.207]  I don't know about that.
[02:37:22.568 --> 02:37:28.111]  The reason I was calling is because I really am very disquieted about our open borders.
[02:37:28.618 --> 02:37:39.480]  And the open border policy, and I heard someone calling earlier, and one of the things that we have to stop doing is focusing on each other, because we're not the problem.
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:47.261]  And you say this all the time, you have to look at the globalists and look and see what they're doing, and one of the things that they're very good at is pitting us against each other.
[02:37:48.181 --> 02:37:56.783]  And so when I hear people call up and they're very angry with the Mexicans or this person or that person coming into this country, I don't like that we have open borders,
[02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:59.982]  But I don't think the immigrants are the problem.
[02:38:00.062 --> 02:38:04.765]  I think that the people who are making the policy to allow them to come into this country are the problem.
[02:38:04.785 --> 02:38:09.287]  Well, yeah, the tyranny that the globalists have kept over Latin America is the reason they're all coming here.
[02:38:09.307 --> 02:38:11.008]  I don't blame them for coming here.
[02:38:11.428 --> 02:38:23.014]  They come here wanting to work, and they get welfare cram in their face, and they get La Reconquista taught to them by the Ford Foundation, by Mr. Whitey, who wants to break the country up.
[02:38:23.599 --> 02:38:24.280]  Exactly.
[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:35.589]  And so I think that people have to keep, instead of focusing our energy on being angry at the immigrants, we need to keep that energy focused on where those decisions are coming from.
[02:38:35.609 --> 02:38:38.832]  Yeah, we're angry on how this is destroying our economy and our future.
[02:38:39.352 --> 02:38:42.735]  And we've got to explain that to the immigrants and the illegal aliens and let them know that.
[02:38:43.737 --> 02:38:46.760]  Tell them up front, hey man, you're driving down the wages.
[02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:48.462]  You're destroying this country.
[02:38:48.482 --> 02:38:49.543]  You're here to balkanize.
[02:38:49.563 --> 02:38:51.705]  You're being let in by these bad guys.
[02:38:52.166 --> 02:38:57.111]  And we don't dislike you, but I don't dislike the water in a flood.
[02:38:57.151 --> 02:38:58.532]  I'm not mad at the water.
[02:38:58.953 --> 02:39:00.975]  It just so happens to be flooding my house.
[02:39:01.335 --> 02:39:02.036]  Exactly.
[02:39:02.356 --> 02:39:10.923]  And the other thing is, I think that the other important point that you make all the time is about how the Democrats and the Republicans need to play good cop, bad cop.
[02:39:11.003 --> 02:39:14.526]  Oh, and on NAFTA, GATT, gun control, they're all together.
[02:39:14.546 --> 02:39:14.746]  Thank you.
[02:39:14.766 --> 02:39:18.589]  I mean, you take the words out of my mouth and that's why you have such a great show.
[02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.970]  Well, thanks for the call.
[02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.671]  Great hearing from you.
[02:39:20.691 --> 02:39:21.712]  Call back any time.
[02:39:22.352 --> 02:39:24.194]  Let's talk to Roy in Texas.
[02:39:24.274 --> 02:39:24.834]  One more caller.
[02:39:25.234 --> 02:39:25.815]  Roy, go ahead.
[02:39:27.045 --> 02:39:38.988]  Hello there, I'd like to know what number on the telephone we might best call in order to demand arresting officers appear at a massive public gathering of illegal aliens.
[02:39:41.509 --> 02:39:43.469]  Well, we just talked about that earlier.
[02:39:43.489 --> 02:39:50.231]  A caller called in from Nebraska and talked about how they're having in Washington some giant gathering of illegal aliens.
[02:39:50.591 --> 02:39:54.032]  Do we call to demand arresting officers appear at it?
[02:39:56.047 --> 02:39:57.228]  Well, I think that's important.
[02:39:57.248 --> 02:40:01.810]  I think people should call the newspapers, and they should call the police department in D.C.
[02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:09.894]  and say, we demand you go out and arrest thousands of lawbreakers, or it's selective enforcement.
[02:40:10.454 --> 02:40:11.655]  It is discrimination.
[02:40:12.095 --> 02:40:14.737]  I mean, they pull over some middle-class family, they throw the book at them.
[02:40:15.157 --> 02:40:21.080]  They pull over into checkpoint illegals, and sheriffs have been on the record saying this, they're not even allowed to arrest coyotes smuggling people.
[02:40:21.912 --> 02:40:25.234]  So we should start calling the police department in D.C.
[02:40:25.294 --> 02:40:27.335]  and New York and demanding arrests, huh?
[02:40:28.675 --> 02:40:30.176]  I hardly agree with that, yes.
[02:40:31.256 --> 02:40:32.897]  Okay, I just didn't know whom to call.
[02:40:32.937 --> 02:40:36.199]  If we could get someone to have their numbers, it'd make it convenient for everyone.
[02:40:36.219 --> 02:40:43.622]  Well, what you do is you call 1411 or 411, and you say, what is the number to the Washington, D.C.
[02:40:43.702 --> 02:40:45.083]  Metro Police Department?
[02:40:46.303 --> 02:40:47.844]  And then you tell them that.
[02:40:48.633 --> 02:40:50.174]  Okay, I hope everyone will do it.
[02:40:50.555 --> 02:40:51.976]  Okay, I appreciate the call.
[02:40:52.036 --> 02:40:52.896]  Thanks a lot, Roy.
[02:40:53.297 --> 02:40:54.397]  No more time for calls.
[02:40:54.417 --> 02:41:04.085]  I'm going to come back and hit seven or eight key pieces of news, recap a few top stories, and maybe even put a quick plug in for my videos and my books.
[02:41:04.865 --> 02:41:16.594]  I hope folks will get Order Out of Chaos by Paul Watson because it really is a great book and it covers the history of government-sponsored terror and some of the latest examples of terrorism in England carried out by the government and in Israel.
[02:41:17.999 --> 02:41:23.506]  It gets into the fake UFO movement controlled by the Rothschilds, exposes that as a government operation.
[02:41:24.047 --> 02:41:33.339]  I hope you'll go to PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and get Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order because it's an important book and it's only going to get out there if you promote it.
[02:41:33.359 --> 02:41:34.060]  So please do that.
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:34.481]  We'll be back.
[02:41:35.982 --> 02:41:40.324]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.504 --> 02:41:44.946]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.086 --> 02:41:49.467]  There is a chance to use this disaster in a New World Order.
[02:41:49.567 --> 02:41:50.848]  A New World Order.
[02:41:51.608 --> 02:41:52.569]  Can emerge.
[02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:56.854]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.914 --> 02:42:03.862]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.982 --> 02:42:06.005]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.385 --> 02:42:16.788]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:16.968 --> 02:42:22.370]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:26.611]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:26.631 --> 02:42:26.871]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:26.911 --> 02:42:27.912]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:35.254 --> 02:42:42.778]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:42:43.058 --> 02:42:56.045]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:42:56.325 --> 02:42:59.607]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:42:59.967 --> 02:43:10.433]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:43:10.734 --> 02:43:11.214]  That's right!
[02:43:11.414 --> 02:43:18.518]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:43:18.818 --> 02:43:22.901]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[02:43:23.081 --> 02:43:30.310]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:43:30.490 --> 02:43:32.853]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:33.494 --> 02:43:36.237]  Oh my God!
[02:43:36.497 --> 02:43:41.143]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor!
[02:43:41.483 --> 02:43:42.144]  Yes, it's true.
[02:43:42.224 --> 02:43:44.926]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:43:45.066 --> 02:43:49.090]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:43:49.210 --> 02:43:49.750]  You heard it right.
[02:43:49.950 --> 02:43:54.975]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:43:55.095 --> 02:43:56.155]  The list goes on and on.
[02:43:56.376 --> 02:44:00.479]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[02:44:00.579 --> 02:44:02.721]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[02:44:02.901 --> 02:44:04.122]  This is a limited time offer.
[02:44:04.242 --> 02:44:08.546]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[02:44:08.726 --> 02:44:13.369]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[02:44:13.509 --> 02:44:17.851]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[02:44:17.891 --> 02:44:22.114]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[02:44:22.234 --> 02:44:23.714]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[02:44:23.734 --> 02:44:24.735]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[02:44:38.752 --> 02:44:44.776]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:44:45.397 --> 02:44:48.419]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:49.379 --> 02:44:55.844]  Alright, it's the final segment, my friends, of this live Friday edition.
[02:44:55.884 --> 02:44:58.986]  Again, the show airs from 11 to 2 Central during the day.
[02:44:59.146 --> 02:45:06.231]  That's 12 PM to 3 PM Eastern, and then of course back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:45:06.331 --> 02:45:07.272]  And before the break,
[02:45:08.072 --> 02:45:11.173]  I was told you to get Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:45:11.533 --> 02:45:12.633]  Now, I didn't write this book.
[02:45:12.713 --> 02:45:13.613]  Paul Watson did.
[02:45:13.833 --> 02:45:14.634]  It's his first book.
[02:45:14.694 --> 02:45:15.394]  It's incredible.
[02:45:16.014 --> 02:45:32.578]  If you want something that's very well written, that covers a wide range of modern history, and even some ancient history, government-sponsored terror, that then gets into the latest of tales of terrorism being used by governments to control populations around the world,
[02:45:33.769 --> 02:45:34.089]  I think so.
[02:45:56.378 --> 02:45:58.499]  My book is only $12, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:45:58.539 --> 02:46:00.460]  It's about September 11th, the government sponsored terror.
[02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:06.763]  These are the most important subjects out there, and you need to be experts on it, well-versed in it, to be leaders in your area.
[02:46:06.803 --> 02:46:14.767]  So get Ole Watson's book, get my book, go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, and yes, get the videos.
[02:46:14.787 --> 02:46:17.949]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Mashes of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:46:19.059 --> 02:46:23.661]  We've got The Dark Seekers Inside Bohemian Grove, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:46:24.081 --> 02:46:26.402]  These are all excellent films.
[02:46:26.422 --> 02:46:28.583]  They're $25.95 a piece, all over two hours.
[02:46:29.003 --> 02:46:32.124]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:46:33.645 --> 02:46:35.106]  So don't procrastinate folks.
[02:46:35.786 --> 02:46:36.426]  Don't wait.
[02:46:36.666 --> 02:46:37.507]  Get the videos.
[02:46:37.567 --> 02:46:38.247]  Get the books.
[02:46:38.927 --> 02:46:39.928]  They make great gifts.
[02:46:39.948 --> 02:46:43.569]  They have the gift of opening people's eyes and unlocking their minds.
[02:46:44.129 --> 02:46:45.650]  The total free number to order is one...
[02:46:47.005 --> 02:46:47.185]  888-253-3139.
[02:46:47.245 --> 02:46:47.505]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:46:47.605 --> 02:46:48.645]  Or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:46:48.665 --> 02:46:49.345]  Or InfoWars.com.
[02:46:49.365 --> 02:46:53.806]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:47:14.238 --> 02:47:17.523]  Now last week I read a Statesman article about how the rich got richer.
[02:47:17.764 --> 02:47:19.967]  The Fortune 500 and the top 20 families.
[02:47:21.229 --> 02:47:24.033]  As the government, right next to it, the government grew at record levels.
[02:47:24.834 --> 02:47:29.001]  But the general public, pension funds, jobs, you name it, constricted.
[02:47:30.330 --> 02:47:33.151]  There's another headline today out of the Associated Press.
[02:47:33.351 --> 02:47:35.552]  Poverty rises, income down.
[02:47:35.652 --> 02:47:39.774]  Census says poverty rose and income levels declined in 2002.
[02:47:39.934 --> 02:47:44.936]  For the second straight year as the nation's economy continued struggling after the first recession in a decade.
[02:47:45.217 --> 02:47:46.777]  Census Bureau reported Friday.
[02:47:48.498 --> 02:47:50.379]  But the government's getting bigger and the rich are getting richer.
[02:47:50.619 --> 02:47:54.200]  That shows, again, they get their control out of contractions.
[02:47:54.921 --> 02:47:57.622]  Again, Austin voted to strike down the Patriot Act.
[02:47:58.585 --> 02:48:00.426]  And we were there speaking, and the U.S.
[02:48:00.466 --> 02:48:01.347]  Attorney, Deputy U.S.
[02:48:01.367 --> 02:48:03.027]  Attorney, was throwing fits trying to stop it.
[02:48:03.468 --> 02:48:04.488]  That was a great success.
[02:48:04.528 --> 02:48:05.829]  I want to commend those that were part of it.
[02:48:06.369 --> 02:48:11.132]  And I watched the Austin American Statesman, who wrote this spin piece, actually sitting in the lap.
[02:48:11.152 --> 02:48:16.474]  I mean, they were literally touching and patting and all right up around him.
[02:48:17.255 --> 02:48:25.619]  It was just endless worship fest, to a nauseating extent, going on with these guys there.
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:27.841]  And we've seen that.
[02:48:28.421 --> 02:48:33.984]  Well, you know how Ashcroft told all the editors to write propaganda pieces, and told the reporters too, and that certainly happened here.
[02:48:35.465 --> 02:48:37.926]  Also, McClintock pressed to quit the race.
[02:48:39.087 --> 02:48:44.210]  Again, one of the only conservative candidates, well, the only conservative candidate, pressed by the Republican Party nationally of the state to quit.
[02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:50.133]  They want a guy who's in Richard Robert, or whatever his name, Maple, for photos and says he loves Hitler.
[02:48:52.478 --> 02:48:54.219]  That's basically it for this show.
[02:48:54.239 --> 02:48:56.960]  A lot of information we didn't cover is on the website.
[02:48:57.020 --> 02:49:00.241]  Please spread the word about the broadcast and about our wonderful A.M.
[02:49:00.261 --> 02:49:00.481]  and F.M.
[02:49:00.541 --> 02:49:02.142]  affiliates, our sponsors.
[02:49:03.142 --> 02:49:09.325]  And to the listeners, the folks that run the show, and to my producer, to everybody, thank you for all you do.
[02:49:09.345 --> 02:49:11.666]  I want everybody to have a wonderful weekend.
[02:49:11.686 --> 02:49:12.926]  Spend some time with your family.
[02:49:13.426 --> 02:49:19.209]  And be aware of the propaganda that's around you in the newspaper, on the news, but more importantly in the sitcoms and dramas.
[02:49:19.649 --> 02:49:20.589]  Become conscious.
[02:49:21.250 --> 02:49:21.910]  Look around you.
[02:49:22.552 --> 02:49:23.393]  It'll be an eye-opener.
[02:49:23.433 --> 02:49:23.834]  Take care.
[02:49:26.417 --> 02:49:35.047]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:49:35.267 --> 02:49:36.849]  The Berkey Light self-sterilized
