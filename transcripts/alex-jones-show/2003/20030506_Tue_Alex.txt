[00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.746]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:15.948]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:17.649]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.510]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.951]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:22.571]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.894]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:31.536]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:41.914]  All right, my friends, we have a powerful broadcast for you today.
[00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:51.446]  Just masses of vital information developing on the police state, on the thought crime front here in the homeland.
[00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.532]  We also have Bechtel, that wicked organization.
[00:00:55.572 --> 00:01:00.454]  It's now coming out in the mainstream news that Bechtel is big with the Bin Ladens.
[00:01:00.474 --> 00:01:05.317]  Well, of course, you don't build anything in the Middle East unless you are with the CIA.
[00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:14.041]  I mean, the Bin Laden British intelligence family has been doing such a good job with the British ever since they created Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:26.275]  So we're going to get into that and Dick Cheney and the billions of dollars, the private contracts, no betting allowed, unprecedented corruption in your face.
[00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:32.057]  And the media is unified, the Chris Matthews of the world, Lovebush, what does that tell you?
[00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:33.097]  Well, it tells you this!
[00:01:33.577 --> 00:01:44.161]  On a Knight Ritter newspaper's headline, on Infowars.com right now, neoconservatives push for a new world order.
[00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.910]  Knight Ritter Newspapers.
[00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.611]  Now, five years ago, you were insane to say it exists.
[00:01:52.452 --> 00:02:00.054]  As we speak, FBI training manuals written in the last year say that you are delusional and are a terrorist.
[00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:01.935]  It does not exist.
[00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:08.077]  As presidents, prime ministers, publicly set it up and speak of it.
[00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.303]  Neoconservatives, when you hear neoconservative, you think Bill Clinton on PCP, steroids and growth hormone.
[00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:21.805]  Neoconservatives push for the New World Order.
[00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:33.310]  Oh yes, and we're also talking about an article here out of US News and World Report, where protesting is really not allowed in America anymore, they admit it.
[00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:36.648]  Let's just say it's part of being an American now.
[00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.373]  Also, it says a cop photographed class projects.
[00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:42.016]  He objected to.
[00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:44.199]  Snuck into the school at night.
[00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.607]  And he's being hailed as a commissar, a political officer.
[00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:53.662]  Also, passport will carry eye prints.
[00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:54.743]  We'll get to that.
[00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:56.703]  Even World Net Daily admits it.
[00:02:56.724 --> 00:03:02.626]  I wasn't going to cover it yesterday when the Toronto Star was saying it because I knew it would come out in other conservative publications.
[00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:06.848]  We like to go from it from that angle because we know how the liberals are.
[00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.570]  Turns out what we told you about a month ago was completely true.
[00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:15.052]  The military had pulled out two days before with Jessica Lynch.
[00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:20.315]  The doctors were walking down the street calling our troops less than a mile away saying, come pick her up.
[00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:27.449]  And, uh, when they did come pick him up, they got shoved around, beat up, machine guns pointed at them.
[00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.812]  Iraqis weren't within 50 miles of their government people.
[00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:34.995]  They'd fled two days before, and then in the news it was this daring raid.
[00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:45.502]  Now, again, we're all glad Jessica Lynch got saved, but as I told you, you guys like this, you like being hokey, you like being conned, you're gonna get conned.
[00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:50.346]  This thing had con written all over it with the cameras and all the rest of it.
[00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.470]  And now you've been lied to yet again.
[00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.571]  It wasn't even a rescue.
[00:03:55.472 --> 00:04:02.317]  And, uh, I made the point that I wish we would have saved, uh, Spiker, the pilot shot down in the first Gulf War, and the others.
[00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:10.643]  I wish we would have given treatment to our tens of thousands of troops that got hit with sarin nerve gas when our government blew up those bunkers.
[00:04:10.743 --> 00:04:20.050]  But, again, that's unpatriotic to say, actually give healthcare to the troops, to say that we should actually treat them when they're injured in battle is not patriotic and is communist.
[00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:22.690]  I understand that I'm pro-gun as well.
[00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.515]  Bush is about to reinstate the Clinton assault weapons ban and sign new gun laws and that's conservative.
[00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:31.637]  I'm pro-gun, pro-sovereignty, pro-border, pro-family.
[00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:32.738]  I am a commie.
[00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:35.141]  Alright, we're getting the new paradigm straight.
[00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:37.382]  But neocons push for new world order.
[00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:39.404]  World government is conservative.
[00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:40.065]  Ah!
[00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:45.618]  Also, paying cash triggers alert for terrorism in the new world.
[00:04:45.658 --> 00:04:48.840]  This is out of the Virginia Pilot.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.840]  Paying cash anywhere is now a terrorist act.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.961]  They'll be phasing it out soon.
[00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:53.962]  We can get to that.
[00:04:53.982 --> 00:04:55.622]  Again, Bechtel tied to Bin Laden.
[00:04:55.642 --> 00:04:56.583]  This is from CNN.
[00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.324]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:02.765]  Big, big show today, tonight, this morning.
[00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:04.646]  Depending on what time zone you're listening to.
[00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:06.847]  And it's all on InfoWars.gov.
[00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:14.400]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.085]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:30.735]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:35.239]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:43.784]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:50.428]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper and foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.
[00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:55.011]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.434]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:05:59.814 --> 00:06:04.037]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at
[00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:07.838]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:08.919]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:18.383]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.623 --> 00:06:23.365]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:29.228]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:29.468 --> 00:06:34.012]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:41.380]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.923]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:45.924]  And much, much more.
[00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:48.625]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:55.590]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.034]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:01.474]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:15.212]  Millions of people who've never set foot in a casino take a dangerous gamble every day.
[00:07:15.612 --> 00:07:17.253]  Living without health insurance.
[00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:19.595]  You can't afford not to have it.
[00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:28.383]  But affordable insurance can be hard to find, especially if you're a hard-working entrepreneur or if you work for a company that doesn't offer benefits.
[00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:35.989]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee has a solution with their dependable, affordable health insurance plans.
[00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:42.171]  More than likely, they have a plan that fits your individual needs perfectly at a price you can afford.
[00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:47.132]  After all, if you can't pay the premium, all the insurance in the world is useless.
[00:07:47.512 --> 00:07:50.733]  We're here 24 hours a day to help, so call 800-807-5989.
[00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:51.934]  Don't gamble, go to Midwest!
[00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.555]  Not available in all states.
[00:07:57.575 --> 00:07:59.156]  That toll-free number again is 800-807-5989.
[00:07:59.176 --> 00:07:59.276]  800-807-5989.
[00:07:59.296 --> 00:07:59.336]  800-807-5989.
[00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:00.356]  Ease the T-Rex in political talk.
[00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:02.297]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.794 --> 00:08:41.527]  If you'll just be honest, you'll just do a little research, you'll find out real quick that sadistic control freaks, ruthless organized crime subjects run the world.
[00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:50.795]  And their business is controlling you, dumbing you down, turning you into mindless idiots to follow them.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:02.968]  Everything is about crafting an image for these people that they are establishment and that they have all this regalia, that they can be trusted and they have all these high motives.
[00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:05.791]  It's Madison Avenue spin.
[00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:07.552]  It's propaganda.
[00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:11.575]  It's confidence men scamming you and your family.
[00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:41.173]  One would have to hide on the dark side of the moon to not know that Bin Laden is CIA, to not know that his family was set up by British intelligence over 70 years ago, that they carry out dangerous missions for the New World Order all over the world, and that if you want to build anything in the Middle East, you go one place, the Bin Ladens, and that you're not allowed to build
[00:09:42.319 --> 00:09:52.104]  Any type of military structure, or pipeline, anything, unless you go through the CIA and Her Majesty's Al Qaeda.
[00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:56.165]  I mean, the Bottoms.
[00:09:57.286 --> 00:10:07.991]  So, this is the reality, and it's now out in the news, and it's also in Fortune, not just in Swiss Info and other publications, that yes, Rumsfeld,
[00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:15.572]  Involved in the deal transferring the nuclear reactors to North Korea with full knowledge of what was happening.
[00:10:16.573 --> 00:10:18.954]  Same guy as the bag man arming Saddam.
[00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:27.718]  Same story, but they say arrest anyone who ever aided terrorists or who proliferated weapons of mass destruction.
[00:10:31.215 --> 00:10:33.717]  And here's the type of news I have in front of me today.
[00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:35.418]  Three large stacks of it.
[00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.181]  Neoconservatives push for a New World Order.
[00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:45.126]  Now, in case you didn't know, a New World Order is a place where you have absolutely no freedom.
[00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:46.447]  You don't own any private property.
[00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:51.331]  Your children are taken from you at the age of three or four, if you're lucky.
[00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:55.935]  This is their public plan now being implemented incrementally.
[00:10:57.134 --> 00:10:58.314]  That'll never happen here.
[00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:02.215]  Oh yeah, you just heard our guest on from the Homeschool Legal Defense Association.
[00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:05.856]  They passed that law in Florida where everybody gets a visit when their child's born.
[00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:08.257]  At the hospital by the child snatchers.
[00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:13.038]  Incidentally, I have an article here out of Mesa, Arizona.
[00:11:14.218 --> 00:11:20.159]  And the family didn't want to give their child, their newborn, first child, middle class family, didn't want to give them the hepatitis B shot.
[00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.320]  It's been very dangerous and leads to a lot of problems.
[00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:26.153]  And there's no law they had to, so the hospital didn't care.
[00:11:26.173 --> 00:11:29.915]  They just called in the police and are right now in a standoff threatening to take the kid.
[00:11:29.935 --> 00:11:31.096]  They don't care if there's law.
[00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:33.777]  This is about the new age of the New World Order.
[00:11:34.498 --> 00:11:39.701]  But you know, those hospital workers and those cops, when the smallpox injection come along, aren't going to take it.
[00:11:40.682 --> 00:11:41.522]  No, sir!
[00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:44.284]  It isn't an age of law anymore.
[00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:46.025]  It's an age of the gun.
[00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:47.766]  It's an age of the gun.
[00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:49.487]  It's like Walter Smith, the federal judge,
[00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:51.909]  There was going to be a Waco civil trial.
[00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:52.850]  The Davidians were suing.
[00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.611]  He took the case.
[00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:57.436]  The feds gave it to him, and he said, no juries in this one.
[00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.018]  People said, well, that's something new.
[00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:02.001]  And he said, hey, that's what it's all about.
[00:12:03.002 --> 00:12:03.964]  Something new.
[00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:09.650]  There's no law to take this hepatitis B shot, but we're going to do it.
[00:12:10.703 --> 00:12:11.664]  We got guns.
[00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:17.369]  There's no law that we can take juries and get rid of juries, but we're going to do it.
[00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:24.074]  There's no law we're going to bust in the wrong house without a warrant and spread bullets into you and your family, but we're going to do it.
[00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.578]  Don't you know we're the establishment and we're the law.
[00:12:28.818 --> 00:12:30.439]  Whatever we say is the law.
[00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:32.521]  Judge Dredd's the law.
[00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:37.658]  Oh, they told us Bush is different.
[00:12:37.678 --> 00:12:39.099]  He's not like his dad.
[00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:40.939]  He's not for the New World Order.
[00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:46.460]  I've heard on the news, the neocons... Oh, Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.220]  You've got to support him or you're with the New World Order.
[00:12:51.981 --> 00:12:54.281]  Neoconservatives push for a New World Order.
[00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:55.381]  Knight Ritter newspapers.
[00:12:56.041 --> 00:13:05.443]  I guess Dick Holman needs to be arrested because the FBI training manuals and the footage and video we have of FEMA hitting police, they talk about a constitution and a New World Order.
[00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.448]  Well, I mean, we read the article out of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution yesterday.
[00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:12.890]  Political activist, gun owner, got a job at a gun shop.
[00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:21.076]  Homeland Security was sick on him because it said in the article, first three lines, he believes in a new world order takeover.
[00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:24.038]  And it said that was enough to
[00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:28.588]  Get local officers very concerned.
[00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:33.293]  They had to call the homeland and got him fired.
[00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:36.996]  Cause it's all part of living in America, that crazy.
[00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:40.420]  Has been at rallies and talked about a new world order.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.722]  We think he may be working a gun shop to get intel on our officers.
[00:13:46.863 --> 00:13:52.546]  He believes in that imaginary thing that all these presidents are on TV talking about.
[00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:54.427]  I mean, this is how crazy it is.
[00:13:54.787 --> 00:14:01.670]  They have police in big meeting halls being told, the founding fathers are terrorists, Christians are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists.
[00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:02.891]  It's word for word, folks.
[00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:04.732]  Out of their manuals, on video, we have them.
[00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.020]  Folks, they're crazy.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:17.364]  They swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and they're sitting there nodding their heads when FEMA tells them the Constitution's illegal.
[00:14:17.764 --> 00:14:18.645]  But again, I'd like to know.
[00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:23.607]  So the Newell Order doesn't exist, but it's in the newspaper every day.
[00:14:23.847 --> 00:14:26.429]  Every day, dozens of times a day, we see it now.
[00:14:27.109 --> 00:14:30.891]  This is the news service, the night-runner newspapers, for several long years,
[00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:34.042]  Bill Kristol, agitated for a U.S.
[00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:38.485]  coup against Saddam Hussein, argued that America should remake the world to serve its own interests.
[00:14:38.525 --> 00:14:41.626]  You mean the bankers that own America, not the American people.
[00:14:42.207 --> 00:14:45.088]  Few bothered to listen at the time, so how does he feel now?
[00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:49.650]  In his office the other day, he grinned without smirking.
[00:14:49.771 --> 00:14:57.815]  That's how most of the hawkish defense intellectuals, better known as neoconservatives, are behaving these days, although they're sitting pretty in wartime Washington.
[00:14:58.255 --> 00:14:59.896]  They're trying not to preen.
[00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:11.082]  And it goes on to say Crystal refuses to strut his stuff because he knows how fast and high and mighty can be brought low in this town.
[00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:14.206]  After all, he was once Vice President Dan Quill, Chief of Staff.
[00:15:14.507 --> 00:15:15.508]  Still, he can't resist.
[00:15:16.653 --> 00:15:21.236]  Intending that September 11th made all the neocons look like prophets.
[00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:29.301]  Oh, we saw earlier than most people, I'd say you did, that the world was very dangerous.
[00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.162]  And you specifically listed the World Trade Center, didn't you?
[00:15:32.462 --> 00:15:35.604]  That America's drift during the 1990s was very dangerous.
[00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:44.990]  He said Wednesday at the Weekly Standard, the Rupert Murdoch Finance Magazine that edits, that promotes the neocon credo.
[00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:47.309]  We were alarmed.
[00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.050]  We tried to call attention to all that.
[00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:55.012]  So I don't want to say we feel vindicated, but we do feel our analysis was right.
[00:15:55.032 --> 00:16:05.356]  And of course, you got Ripper Murdoch with the most filthy, evil, society-destroying shows, but with the good, fair, and balanced conservatism.
[00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:09.338]  O'Reilly's saying ban SUVs out of the other mouth.
[00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:11.899]  Oh, well, Bush wants to register the guns again.
[00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:13.079]  I'll let him.
[00:16:13.119 --> 00:16:14.060]  It's needed.
[00:16:15.103 --> 00:16:16.344]  And they call this conservative.
[00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:22.370]  There's a whole pack of these people that scream down any opposition.
[00:16:24.753 --> 00:16:25.934]  I, for one, am just sick of it.
[00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:28.657]  I know I start every show about these people, but here's a new angle.
[00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:36.364]  The neocons, think tank warriors and commentators, all of whom cite Ronald Reagan's moral clarity.
[00:16:36.384 --> 00:16:37.946]  We have nothing to do with Ronald Reagan.
[00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:53.110]  You're the guys that, well, Bush ran against you in Neocon, ran against Reagan, and then when Reagan didn't follow orders, had a little accident, and of course, the Bushes were meeting with the shooter's family the night before.
[00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.234]  That's the Houston Chronicle, but again, let's just ignore it.
[00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.212]  And Iraq is just the beginning, said Crystal Cherli, contending.
[00:17:01.652 --> 00:17:04.534]  President Bush is committed pretty far down the road.
[00:17:04.554 --> 00:17:10.057]  The logic of events say you can't go halfway, you can't liberate Iraq, and then quit.
[00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:19.423]  They're selling the attack on all these 62 countries, 61 now, and how are they going to get, how are they, they said a hundred year war.
[00:17:20.244 --> 00:17:27.508]  Yeah, if they invade one country a year, or a year and a half as they've been doing, yeah, you're looking at about
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.381]  Ninety, eighty-five, ninety years.
[00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:31.101]  So, yeah.
[00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:31.621]  Yeah.
[00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:32.521]  A hundred years.
[00:17:33.222 --> 00:17:37.543]  And, of course, domestically, you're getting your national ID cards, the thumb scanners are going in.
[00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:40.644]  It's all happening right now.
[00:17:41.364 --> 00:17:43.005]  And, of course, that's the main war.
[00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:45.526]  And done.
[00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:49.027]  Now people are being arrested for wearing anti-war t-shirts that just say, give peace a chance.
[00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:49.847]  Hey, that's not allowed here.
[00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:50.748]  Oh, no.
[00:17:51.288 --> 00:17:52.668]  That's Al-Qaeda right there.
[00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:57.790]  But then those that are really with Al-Qaeda, hey, no discussion of it.
[00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:01.583]  Folks, just put up with it and go along with it.
[00:18:02.683 --> 00:18:04.243]  Well, and it goes on and on.
[00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:06.804]  Yeah, the neocons predicted an attack.
[00:18:06.824 --> 00:18:10.945]  Gary Hart, one of the chief neocons, I mean, he's a great Democrat.
[00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:16.806]  Of course, he's a leading neocon now on the board there with the CFR and with Rudman.
[00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:21.087]  And they said, they said, we're going to be hit by terrorists.
[00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:23.788]  Big tall buildings are going to be in trouble, he said on Hardball.
[00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:26.188]  4911, Kurt laughing.
[00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:27.489]  Chris Matthews laughed.
[00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:28.589]  It was a CFR moment.
[00:18:29.623 --> 00:18:33.125]  Lots of giggling around the table, lots of smacking, lots of rubbing hands together.
[00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:36.307]  And I got on the air and I said, look out, New York's about to get it.
[00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:39.168]  Call the White House, tell them to stop, to call off the attack.
[00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:43.831]  Call Congress, tell them to stop the terrorists, the bin Laden's that they're going to use as a scapegoat.
[00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:48.814]  And I said that on TV and radio and you heard me back in July 2001 over and over again.
[00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:51.195]  I never give out the White House and Congressional phone numbers.
[00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:51.855]  I did that time.
[00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:54.237]  God, it's on the record.
[00:18:55.317 --> 00:18:58.279]  So, yeah, it says Crystal refuses to strut his stuff.
[00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:02.092]  But admits that neocons look like prophets.
[00:19:02.372 --> 00:19:03.033]  Oh, yes.
[00:19:04.113 --> 00:19:09.855]  Yes, you certainly know how to call the terrorism, don't you CIA boys?
[00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:13.577]  Oh my goodness.
[00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:17.478]  So, you got Crystal and the rest of them running around.
[00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:24.821]  And we have a country now that is... all the liberties disappearing.
[00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:26.982]  Everything that makes America, America is dying.
[00:19:29.645 --> 00:19:31.687]  And it is, it is very painful.
[00:19:31.727 --> 00:19:33.909]  But when we get back, I will get into Bechtel.
[00:19:34.469 --> 00:19:37.351]  We'll go to Fortune and CNN and others.
[00:19:38.672 --> 00:19:44.657]  And they admit, and of course these groups, the people that own the New World Order, own these media outlets, they just kind of whitewash it.
[00:19:44.737 --> 00:19:53.284]  Okay, Bechtel does work with the Bin Ladens, just like Carlisle and everybody else, but that's just the way it is.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:05.256]  Can you imagine if you or I was involved with the Bin Laden family and al-Qaeda and all these groups and had meetings with them like the President did according to Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klaman?
[00:20:06.177 --> 00:20:07.479]  We'd be in jail, but not them.
[00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:08.421]  Have dinner with Bin Laden.
[00:20:10.265 --> 00:20:12.047]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:20:12.227 --> 00:20:17.872]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:20:18.213 --> 00:20:19.053]  Probably never, right?
[00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:22.397]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[00:20:22.677 --> 00:20:25.099]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.604]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:19.249]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:29.898]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:21:30.058 --> 00:21:34.402]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:34.602 --> 00:21:42.929]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:21:43.209 --> 00:21:49.593]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:21:49.693 --> 00:21:54.176]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:12.685]  Jones USA offers an alternative to duct tape and plastic.
[00:22:12.845 --> 00:22:22.976]  Our portable nuclear biological chemical shelter, the PNBC-273, uses an advanced NBC filtering system with overpressure valve that meets or exceeds U.S.
[00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:24.458]  military specifications.
[00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:29.664]  This system can operate on one 10-volt AC or 12-volt DC or by manual pump.
[00:22:29.964 --> 00:22:33.266]  The system can be assembled on a concrete slab or on bare earth.
[00:22:33.326 --> 00:22:39.589]  With a plastic liner and earth anchors, the PNBC-273 can be assembled in one day using simple tools.
[00:22:39.849 --> 00:22:43.871]  The 17-foot, 6-inch diameter dome can double as a backyard storage shed.
[00:22:43.951 --> 00:22:49.834]  We have another new product, the underground dome, which we implement engineered steel radius I-beams for structural support.
[00:22:50.134 --> 00:22:53.218]  Available in late summer will be a composite home with a yurt shape.
[00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:57.162]  The yurt will also offer excellent insulation valves and rapid assembly.

[00:23:09.574 --> 00:23:13.376]  Hi, this is Jack Browning with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[00:23:13.676 --> 00:23:20.619]  Use the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.400]  Take control of your own destiny.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.063]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:28.523]  This is more than a handbook.
[00:23:28.703 --> 00:23:32.005]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[00:23:32.405 --> 00:23:33.105]  Here's the deal.
[00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:44.609]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[00:23:44.849 --> 00:23:51.131]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918, and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[00:23:52.211 --> 00:23:57.035]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[00:23:57.375 --> 00:24:01.238]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.618 --> 00:24:03.460]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.043]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:24:08.103 --> 00:24:08.483]  Thank you.
[00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:17.130]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.352]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:24:24.404 --> 00:24:34.646]  One of the chief neocons, Richard Perle, has been called the Prince of Darkness at the Pentagon for over 20 years because, according to press reports, all he talks about is killing.
[00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:36.846]  All he talks about is destruction.
[00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:46.268]  The guy looks like an albino, and he just literally, he's like Count Dracula, he walks around talking about death and destruction, and they admit that here.
[00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:50.929]  Prince of Darkness, neoconservatives push for a New World Order article.
[00:24:50.949 --> 00:24:52.229]  Let me just read one more little
[00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:53.790]  A little tidbit of this.
[00:24:53.831 --> 00:24:56.672]  It's a long story and it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:58.133 --> 00:25:01.095]  And again, big government grabbing your guns, destroying your liberty.
[00:25:01.555 --> 00:25:03.956]  The neocons care little about domestic policy.
[00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:05.377]  They think globally.
[00:25:05.777 --> 00:25:05.997]  Oh!
[00:25:06.718 --> 00:25:10.220]  They don't believe in peaceful coexistence with hostile undemocratic states.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.103]  Rather, they want an unapologetic, idealistic, assertive America
[00:25:16.812 --> 00:25:23.013]  That will foment, in Crystal's words, pro-democratic revolutions around the world if necessary at the point of a gun.
[00:25:23.573 --> 00:25:24.013]  Well, wait!
[00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:25.514]  What are the neocons doing here?
[00:25:26.354 --> 00:25:45.878]  They're gonna go after my guns with gun registration, open borders, globalism, destroying my liberties, face scanning cameras everywhere, a national ID card with a driver's license, national compulsory draft, every Clinton program, BATF tripled in size, oh yeah, it's very conservative,
[00:25:46.593 --> 00:25:49.418]  Are you starting to get the picture of what they've done to you?
[00:25:49.438 --> 00:25:51.522]  This is a major takeover.
[00:25:51.963 --> 00:25:56.030]  And it goes on to Crystal's words that they're forming a new world order.
[00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:58.816]  That imaginary thing we're not supposed to talk about all these years.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.420]  Unbelievable!
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.801]  See, while they were building the New World Order, ehhh, doesn't exist, you're crazy!
[00:26:06.901 --> 00:26:30.166]  Now it's here, oh yeah, the New World Order is to stop terrorists, you're not what the terrorists are, you will know, I have won American sovereignty, I want my guns, ah, ah, ah, that's liberal, and you're like, no, no, they're neocons, that's right they are, and they're gonna run everything now, and they have nicknames like Prince of Darkness, and Rummy Bloody, and others,
[00:26:32.646 --> 00:26:37.750]  It goes on, and here's the wonderful freedom we're having, U.S.
[00:26:38.191 --> 00:26:43.015]  News and World Report, taking it to the streets.
[00:26:43.135 --> 00:26:49.840]  If you are worried about the state of free speech in America, consider the case of long-time protester Brent Bursley.
[00:26:50.381 --> 00:27:00.309]  Last October, the 54-year-old Bursley, carrying an anti-war sign, was arrested in Columbia Metropolitan Airport in South Carolina during a visit by President Bush.
[00:27:00.859 --> 00:27:08.663]  He was on public property at the time, but was charged with trespassing because he was outside the zone established for demonstrators that day.
[00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:16.988]  The zone was on the edge of the highway, a half mile away from the President, where neither Bush nor the media were likely to notice.
[00:27:18.869 --> 00:27:20.250]  The case continues.
[00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.930]  Other oddities.
[00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.331]  This is Berzy.
[00:27:23.089 --> 00:27:24.670]  Well, yeah, that's like in Portland.
[00:27:48.447 --> 00:27:56.549]  Remember when Bill Clinton, a family lost one of their sons in Somalia and they said, we don't, we don't like you, and Clinton had them arrested?
[00:27:58.249 --> 00:27:59.489]  Well, it's a lot worse than that.
[00:27:59.529 --> 00:28:04.670]  I mean, when Bush was governor, I just said, hey, what about the CFR Interlateral Commission at the end of a speech?
[00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.931]  And he had me kidnapped for 45 minutes, you know?
[00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:09.531]  And I was being pretty nice to Bush.
[00:28:09.612 --> 00:28:10.672]  And Bush knew me, too.
[00:28:10.692 --> 00:28:11.512]  Has anybody ever said that?
[00:28:11.532 --> 00:28:14.833]  He goes, oh, that's Alex Jones, and leaned over to Phil Graham and told him something.
[00:28:15.573 --> 00:28:16.413]  No one could hear what.
[00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:23.936]  Of course, my sister went to school with Bush's daughters, and Bush probably doesn't remember me for that.
[00:28:24.276 --> 00:28:25.337]  I know him from that.
[00:28:26.197 --> 00:28:27.958]  But, I mean, he's just a little creature.
[00:28:28.318 --> 00:28:31.119]  All Bush is is a little front man, but he's not running anything.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.720]  No matter how many photo ops they run.
[00:28:35.121 --> 00:28:43.204]  Imagine if Bill Clinton had been in the Texas Air National Guard, shown up for two weeks, and gone AWOL for several years, and had an unsatisfactory flying record.
[00:28:43.224 --> 00:28:45.645]  I mean, almost got killed the times he flew.
[00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:46.766]  He's just a horrible pilot.
[00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.350]  Probably on the jack.
[00:28:49.371 --> 00:28:52.672]  And, uh... But now it's war hero!
[00:28:52.712 --> 00:28:53.953]  Look at him land!
[00:28:53.973 --> 00:28:55.454]  This man is a leader!
[00:28:55.974 --> 00:28:57.855]  Chris Matthews, who could criticize Bush?
[00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:00.216]  He said, this president is incredible!
[00:29:00.996 --> 00:29:01.796]  Look at him!
[00:29:02.497 --> 00:29:05.598]  Chris Matthews, the ultra-liberal, worshiping Bush.
[00:29:05.978 --> 00:29:07.219]  Folks, this is their heyday.
[00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.139]  Government's taking over.
[00:29:09.139 --> 00:29:12.700]  I got video of Bush hugging Dashiell in love squeezes at the State of the Union.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.981]  These guys, this is all a sick joke.
[00:29:15.481 --> 00:29:27.585]  I got video of that creature, Schumer worshipping Ridge and Mueller and Ashcroft.
[00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:29.686]  I mean, these guys, these guys are taking over.
[00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:31.387]  Another one.
[00:29:31.847 --> 00:29:35.928]  Vermont cop photographed class projects to make sure they weren't un-American.
[00:29:36.748 --> 00:29:38.509]  Oh yeah, you can't have that.
[00:29:40.084 --> 00:29:44.165]  Well, we gotta watch what the kids are doing in their class projects.
[00:29:45.105 --> 00:29:46.706]  What are they thinking?
[00:29:48.206 --> 00:29:52.827]  It's what America's about!
[00:29:52.847 --> 00:29:53.127]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:53.287 --> 00:29:55.748]  Give me a call.
[00:29:56.168 --> 00:29:57.688]  We'll talk about Bechtel when we get back.
[00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:58.109]  Stay with me.
[00:30:00.709 --> 00:30:01.609]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.730]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.311]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.527 --> 00:30:11.267]  Are you prepared?
[00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:13.868]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:18.510]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:24.272]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our area.
[00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:24.592]  877-605-9200.
[00:30:24.912 --> 00:30:25.553]  Call today.
[00:30:32.335 --> 00:30:37.377]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:38.132 --> 00:30:55.549]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:30:56.349 --> 00:31:02.075]  Alright my friends, Ted in Georgia, Jim in D.C., Pastor Don in Missouri, John in Missouri and others.
[00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.371]  Your calls are coming up momentarily.
[00:31:04.491 --> 00:31:08.353]  I said I'd cover the CNN Bechtel story.
[00:31:09.713 --> 00:31:14.796]  For you, and here it is, Bechtel tied to Bin Laden's.
[00:31:14.836 --> 00:31:17.457]  Well, what isn't with his CIA family?
[00:31:18.017 --> 00:31:21.719]  Some of Bin Laden's family members invested $10 million in a
[00:31:22.626 --> 00:31:30.772]  Equity Fund, run by former Bechtel unit, the Bush administration, launched a war on terror because of the alleged acts of Osama Bin Laden.
[00:31:30.853 --> 00:31:40.240]  Ironically, one of the companies the administration has picked to rebuild Iraq after the latest phase of the war has ties to the Bin Laden family, according to a published report.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:54.634]  Bechtel Corporation, a private construction firm based in San Francisco, recently was awarded a State Department contract potentially worth more than $600 million to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure after the recent US-led war there.
[00:31:55.555 --> 00:31:56.015]  I think so.
[00:32:14.471 --> 00:32:27.656]  According to an article in the May 5th issue of the New Yorker Magazine, several Bin Laden family members, part of a large-scale Saudi Arabian family, that made a fortune in construction business, invested in the private equity fund operated by former subsidiary Bechtel, and it goes on and on.
[00:32:29.017 --> 00:32:31.118]  Now, Bechtel's nothing compared to Carlisle Group.
[00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:41.822]  Carlisle Group, a large portion of it's owned by the Bin Ladens, and the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens, according to Larry Klayman, head of Judicial Watch, and David Shippers, the man that impeached Bill Clinton,
[00:32:43.138 --> 00:32:55.001]  I said all that, well, here on this show, but also in a national press conference, the National Press Club, on C-SPAN last year, and clips of that are in my film, The Masters of Terror Exposed.
[00:32:56.362 --> 00:32:58.222]  Here's another one, Fortune Magazine.
[00:32:58.962 --> 00:33:05.504]  Rummy's North Korea connection, what did Donald Rumsfeld know about ABB's deal to build nuclear reactors there?
[00:33:06.764 --> 00:33:12.106]  And it says that ABB says, well, yes, Rumsfeld's on our board, and yes, he would have to know about the deal.
[00:33:13.072 --> 00:33:15.514]  Uh, for key design components for the reactors.
[00:33:15.634 --> 00:33:18.616]  Key control components that Bill Clinton authorized the transfer of.
[00:33:19.837 --> 00:33:23.801]  And, uh, Rumsfeld declined requests by Fortune to elaborate on his role.
[00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:37.792]  And it gets, the plot gets thicker when it turns out, and I've got all the articles, AP, Reuters, you name it, admitted where Rumsfeld was the bag man with the chemicals and biologicals, uh, in the mid-80s to Saddam.
[00:33:37.832 --> 00:33:39.493]  So it's just the same story.
[00:33:41.309 --> 00:33:46.512]  And now Rumsfeld, it's been leaked three weeks ago, wants to attack North Korea in October.
[00:33:46.652 --> 00:33:47.132]  Official!
[00:33:47.172 --> 00:33:49.193]  They want to attack North Korea.
[00:33:50.534 --> 00:33:54.936]  By the way, Bill Clinton and Oral and Hughes and a bunch of the Bush administration, by the way, were involved in it.
[00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:56.937]  They're all together, no matter what administration.
[00:33:57.537 --> 00:34:01.579]  Helped transfer the MIRV technology, multiple entry device technology.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:10.844]  So one North Korean or Iranian, whoever's missile, because China's selling it to everybody, Pakistan,
[00:34:11.678 --> 00:34:18.040]  Can not just come into our atmosphere and hit one city, but hit dozens with those warheads that come out once it reenters the atmosphere.
[00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:22.162]  And, of course, perfecting the missile components for them.
[00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:32.186]  And the government wants you to give up your liberty for security, but they leave the border wide open while arming all these lunatic countries and transferring all our factories over there?
[00:34:32.206 --> 00:34:34.466]  It's a sick joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:35.107 --> 00:34:37.367]  Let's talk to Ted in Georgia, then Jim and others.
[00:34:37.427 --> 00:34:38.228]  Ted, you're on the air.
[00:34:38.268 --> 00:34:38.628]  Go ahead.
[00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:41.256]  Yes Alex, thanks for having me on.
[00:34:42.356 --> 00:34:56.982]  I heard on one of the shortwave programs about a month ago that this particular individual considered that the neocons were really neotrotskyites.
[00:34:58.462 --> 00:35:06.245]  So I read a book on the autobiography of Leon Trotsky and he espouses what is called
[00:35:07.297 --> 00:35:18.544]  uh... permanent revolution and uh... yeah you gotta have a permanent crisis to do that yeah that's what neocons are and of course the... I mean you didn't think the communists were going to take over as democrats did you?
[00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:20.905]  I beg your pardon?
[00:35:21.225 --> 00:35:28.750]  they always attack you know dressed up in in friendly outfits could I continue?
[00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.633]  yeah go ahead go ahead and continue but it's not a communist conspiracy go ahead in the in the uh...
[00:35:34.853 --> 00:35:50.543]  In this autobiography of Trotsky, he points out that the, and it's a fact I'm sure, that the Communists in Germany in the 20s were in the Social Democrat Party.
[00:35:51.764 --> 00:36:00.609]  And so it was a revolution, permanent revolution, to spread social democracy across the world.
[00:36:00.669 --> 00:36:02.090]  Well yeah, that's what the Nazis are.
[00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.571]  They were socialists.
[00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:09.954]  And socialism is to consolidate the people's wealth, then it transfers to fascism.
[00:36:10.574 --> 00:36:13.356]  But the Nazis were national socialists.
[00:36:13.696 --> 00:36:14.517]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[00:36:14.637 --> 00:36:16.998]  And Trotsky was an international socialist.
[00:36:17.198 --> 00:36:19.020]  And they just said they're internationalists, yes.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:34.510]  But I went to Google, and I put in two words, put in Trotsky or neocon plus Trotsky with a plus sign in between in those spaces, and it was very interesting what came up.
[00:36:35.462 --> 00:36:50.315]  And I learned that Irving Kristol, who is the father of William Kristol, who is also considered to be the father of the neocon movement, was a neotrotskyite.
[00:36:50.355 --> 00:36:50.875]  You got it!
[00:36:51.036 --> 00:36:52.056]  You know what's happening.
[00:36:52.457 --> 00:37:01.705]  Then also I learned on this Google search that a man named Burnham
[00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:08.313]  Who I believe was the first editor of the National Review Magazine, was also a neo-trusteeite.
[00:37:11.874 --> 00:37:20.897]  Yeah, we've got the biggest government ever, we're losing our liberties, and they're building giant FEMA camps, just like under Stalin, it's the same system, but it's a little more sophisticated than that.
[00:37:20.937 --> 00:37:23.497]  They use all these terms interchangeably.
[00:37:23.677 --> 00:37:26.118]  What they are is command and controllers.
[00:37:26.158 --> 00:37:26.478]  Go ahead.
[00:37:26.518 --> 00:37:27.078]  Exactly.
[00:37:27.459 --> 00:37:27.899]  Exactly.
[00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:33.575]  Well, most of us have a knee-jerk reaction to the term communist.
[00:37:33.615 --> 00:37:36.057]  We think about the proletariat.
[00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:43.462]  But the concept is really, as you say, it's a command and control, as you say.
[00:37:43.482 --> 00:37:45.983]  Yeah, the bankers have always... That's what it is.
[00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:46.904]  It's not the bankers.
[00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:56.190]  The bankers were the ones that caused the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to release Trotsky so he could go over to Russia and
[00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:00.724]  Participated in the Revolution there, in 1917.
[00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:03.747]  And it's all facts, and they count on people not looking into it.
[00:38:04.007 --> 00:38:06.790]  Hey, great points, and email me those findings.
[00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.951]  What did you enter in the search engines?
[00:38:08.992 --> 00:38:22.744]  I knew that about Crystal's dad being a commie, but... I entered neocon, just neocon, with no hyphen, plus, used a plus sign with no space between it, Trotsky.
[00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:25.186]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:38:25.206 --> 00:38:26.987]  We'll go to Jim and others here in a second.
[00:38:28.227 --> 00:38:28.607]  You bet.
[00:38:28.627 --> 00:38:31.148]  Look, I've tried to explain the real political paradigm, okay?
[00:38:31.228 --> 00:38:38.650]  If you're on the far left, you've got police in black ski masks, giant prisons, incredible taxation, regulation control, a few strong men running things.
[00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.950]  That's socialism, communism, whatever you want to call it.
[00:38:41.331 --> 00:38:47.152]  On the far right, police in black uniforms, giant prisons, a few strong men running things, total control, high taxation.
[00:38:48.932 --> 00:38:50.633]  The book, until a hundred years ago,
[00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:55.242]  The universities taught liberty, freedom, Magna Carta, Bill of Rights.
[00:38:55.722 --> 00:38:57.984]  It was a discussion of liberty versus tyranny.
[00:38:58.504 --> 00:39:00.105]  It wasn't a discussion of left and right.
[00:39:00.506 --> 00:39:02.087]  They've learned how to give you false choices.
[00:39:02.127 --> 00:39:03.588]  They go, oh, do you want the left or the right?
[00:39:03.868 --> 00:39:06.230]  But there's no difference in substance.
[00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.313]  So call it fascism, call it communism, it's all command and control.
[00:39:11.273 --> 00:39:13.655]  Maybe a little bit different implementation system.
[00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:19.119]  But yeah, you got Bush's grandfather getting detained and having to pay a million plus fine.
[00:39:19.499 --> 00:39:20.400]  Prescott Bush.
[00:39:21.178 --> 00:39:26.944]  We're running almost all Nazi operations globally, over 53% of their steel production, you name it.
[00:39:27.605 --> 00:39:28.606]  Prescott, the Senator.
[00:39:29.927 --> 00:39:34.251]  You've, at the same time, got the other families funding the Communists.
[00:39:34.291 --> 00:39:35.853]  I mean, this is what they do, folks.
[00:39:37.815 --> 00:39:38.215]  Okay?
[00:39:38.395 --> 00:39:39.877]  And it's historical facts.
[00:39:41.694 --> 00:39:47.818]  And so the left thinks you defeat the corrupt corporations, because the big corporations aren't corrupt, they're not free market.
[00:39:48.078 --> 00:39:54.262]  They operate as crime syndicates, as pirate ships basically, feeding on us on the open seas under maritime.
[00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:56.483]  It's law of the gun.
[00:39:57.824 --> 00:40:01.406]  It's Lord of the Flies, it's King Monkey.
[00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.828]  Whoever's the biggest and baddest, King of the Hill.
[00:40:04.608 --> 00:40:05.989]  So that's what they're doing.
[00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.291]  And they know what they're doing.
[00:40:11.034 --> 00:40:16.138]  And, as long as they can confuse us in left-right discussions, but the left says, oh, we've got to stop the big corporations.
[00:40:16.238 --> 00:40:17.318]  Big government's the answer.
[00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:20.080]  Well, actually, big corporations lobby for big government.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:24.643]  It's something they use to go out with their competition, something they use to consolidate and maintain control.
[00:40:25.304 --> 00:40:29.927]  And now they're, quote, privatizing, giving themselves the government and control over your lives.
[00:40:31.227 --> 00:40:32.648]  So, it's basic slavery.
[00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:33.729]  And I've said it.
[00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:34.550]  I'll say it again.
[00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:39.653]  If you want to use these half-baked political terms, communist, socialist, fascist, I'll use them.
[00:40:41.776 --> 00:40:47.497]  And to use it more accurately, socialism leads to fascism.
[00:40:47.817 --> 00:41:01.079]  Over and over again, the bankers fund a socialist communist movement to consolidate power, to get a big government, to get people dependent, and then it is transferred, once they're dependent, to a fascist government.
[00:41:01.379 --> 00:41:03.460]  Now that's what happens over and over again.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.700]  In Russia, it's happened in China, it's now a fascist government.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.221]  Always was, but now they publicly say they're, quote, capitalist.
[00:41:10.822 --> 00:41:12.523]  You're like, what do you mean, capitalist is communist?
[00:41:12.543 --> 00:41:15.644]  Well, Jiang Zemin said it last year before he retired.
[00:41:16.085 --> 00:41:20.047]  He said, capitalism is the greatest form of communism.
[00:41:20.327 --> 00:41:22.588]  And the intellectuals went, whoa, he's right.
[00:41:23.708 --> 00:41:26.170]  And I'm sorry, if you can't get the BBC headline, I'm sorry.
[00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.331]  See, they've scrambled your brain, folks.
[00:41:29.531 --> 00:41:32.533]  The capitalists were there in Tiananmen Square watching a tank parade.
[00:41:32.953 --> 00:41:34.094]  They love slave camps.
[00:41:34.114 --> 00:41:35.034]  They love enslavement.
[00:41:35.354 --> 00:41:35.835]  They love it.
[00:41:35.855 --> 00:41:36.555]  They love control.
[00:41:37.364 --> 00:41:38.065]  It's just slavery.
[00:41:38.085 --> 00:41:38.745]  It's feudalism.
[00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:39.566]  It's serfdom.
[00:41:39.726 --> 00:41:41.627]  And they got all these terms that confuse you.
[00:41:41.868 --> 00:41:42.989]  So you think you've got a choice.
[00:41:43.049 --> 00:41:45.410]  It's like this choice over the New World Order.
[00:41:45.931 --> 00:41:48.713]  They say, will it be a left-wing New World Order or a right-wing New World Order?
[00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:50.875]  Five years ago, there wasn't a New World Order.
[00:41:51.155 --> 00:41:51.976]  Don't talk about it.
[00:41:52.016 --> 00:41:53.297]  Dangerous kooks talk about it.
[00:41:54.538 --> 00:42:00.983]  Public service announcements, you know, in the sitcoms and movies and on television, you know, crazies talk about New World Order.
[00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:07.193]  You know, they had product, propaganda, placement in the movies and TV, admittedly paid for by the Justice Department.
[00:42:07.213 --> 00:42:09.095]  You know, oh, he thinks there's a New World Order.
[00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:09.695]  He's nuts!
[00:42:11.457 --> 00:42:17.682]  And now that it's so far along, they go, okay, there's a New World Order, but will it be left-wing or right-wing, see?
[00:42:17.742 --> 00:42:19.264]  Now it's, we don't want a New World Order.
[00:42:19.524 --> 00:42:21.666]  Now let's just bypass that discussion entirely.
[00:42:21.926 --> 00:42:23.667]  It's, what type of New World Order do you want?
[00:42:23.928 --> 00:42:27.070]  And they'll have you debating how many angels can dance with the head of a pen.
[00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.933]  And you're not even part of the decision process.
[00:42:32.153 --> 00:42:39.439]  So see, we're way in advance of all the phony, mindless political discussions you hear on TV and radio.
[00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:41.901]  We're talking about real political science here.
[00:42:42.181 --> 00:42:43.682]  Let's talk to Jim in D.C.
[00:42:43.942 --> 00:42:45.744]  listening on, what is it, WPLC?
[00:42:46.284 --> 00:42:47.045]  Good to talk to you.
[00:42:47.505 --> 00:42:48.346]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:42:48.546 --> 00:42:51.008]  WPLC, a little station up in Silver Spring, Maryland.
[00:42:51.528 --> 00:42:59.175]  And I accidentally bumped into you, just drifting down the dial, you know, one day and hooked up to you like maybe two weeks ago or something.
[00:43:00.382 --> 00:43:23.476]  A lot of people are tuning into your show here that I know, and it's just amazing that you're on the air speaking out, and one can't really gather in Lafayette Park, down the hill from where I am, and speak out in such a manner as we have been able to all of my life, and part of why I live in Washington, D.C.
[00:43:23.936 --> 00:43:29.920]  But if I could direct your attention, I'd like to just mention two items and ask you to comment, if you don't mind, or what maybe you know on them.
[00:43:31.168 --> 00:43:36.452]  A is Secretary Bennett and this recent gambling thing, and it's not an issue of the gambling.
[00:43:37.493 --> 00:43:47.341]  When he was Secretary under Reagan, then he remained under Clinton, there was a movement to create a whole national textbook operation, and that was Whittle Books.
[00:43:48.802 --> 00:43:54.146]  There was a big grant, $30 million, $20 million, to set up a whole school program with these new books.
[00:43:54.626 --> 00:43:56.748]  The stock went from $7 to almost $30.
[00:43:58.732 --> 00:43:59.913]  Instantly, almost.
[00:44:00.133 --> 00:44:02.314]  And then later, you may know the whole thing bombed.
[00:44:02.955 --> 00:44:08.338]  Recently, a year or so ago, he signed up to go online.
[00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:10.919]  A whole educational system online is a private business.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:19.364]  And I personally just think this thing, I'm not against or for gambling or anything like that, but I just think pretense is cracking, and there's a shell cracking there.
[00:44:20.005 --> 00:44:22.046]  Alright, well let me tell you about the Bennett brothers.
[00:44:22.286 --> 00:44:22.967]  Do it!
[00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:26.509]  Well, I mean, look at Mary Madeline and her
[00:44:27.399 --> 00:44:29.040]  Weirdo husband, Carvel.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.482]  I mean, this is just, this shows us how phony the system is.
[00:44:33.002 --> 00:44:37.444]  You've got these brother-brother teams, sister-sister teams, husband-wife teams.
[00:44:38.045 --> 00:44:38.705]  It's a joke!
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:48.589]  And you've got the liberal Bennett, who's Bill Clinton's lawyer, and you've got the conservative Bennett, with his book of virtues, and the guys are dropping a million on a single gambling run, or million four, excuse me.
[00:44:50.211 --> 00:44:57.158]  And look, he does attend Bohemian Grove, according to the Washington Times, and I direct you to my film, Bohemian Grove, with the news articles.
[00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:00.261]  I'm not saying Bennett does it, but
[00:45:01.121 --> 00:45:06.226]  It's in the news what's trucked in there, on those buses, and let's just say it's not female prostitutes.
[00:45:06.827 --> 00:45:08.729]  So, it's a wild crowd.
[00:45:08.769 --> 00:45:17.138]  The neocons, well, I mean, Henry Kissinger, I got Henry Kissinger in the film dressed up like a woman on the cover of Spy Magazine, with Schultz.
[00:45:18.073 --> 00:45:26.860]  I mean, it's just according to Washington Times, Parade Magazine, all of this, they say that hundreds of male prostitutes are shucked in.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:34.947]  It is running around, drunkenness, people running around screaming, I love Satan, just insane, Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:45:35.887 --> 00:45:36.807]  They're at the base.
[00:45:36.947 --> 00:45:38.788]  Now, I know that all these leaders go there.
[00:45:38.808 --> 00:45:40.948]  A lot of them don't imbibe in it, but a lot of them do.
[00:45:42.268 --> 00:45:43.209]  So, gambling?
[00:45:43.269 --> 00:45:44.889]  I mean, one of these people involved in gambling?
[00:45:44.929 --> 00:45:48.130]  I mean, it's like Pat Robertson and all his racehorses.
[00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.750]  These guys are a bunch of thugs.
[00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.691]  And Pat Robertson, you know, I'm a conservative.
[00:45:53.871 --> 00:45:54.751]  I'm against abortion.
[00:45:55.111 --> 00:46:01.693]  That means I don't get on TV and say China's doing what it has to do with forced abortions and infanticide.
[00:46:02.113 --> 00:46:03.873]  And I don't forgive that type of thing.
[00:46:04.463 --> 00:46:07.164]  Bush calls himself a conservative and comes after my guys?
[00:46:07.404 --> 00:46:18.407]  Well, that's where I see the crack, is the pretense of purity, and the pointed finger at everyone else in society, and then BOOM!
[00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:26.690]  This thing opens, and under it is a very, very grubby, dangerous little money machine swamp.
[00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:32.732]  Well, I mean, look, when you've got people that are high up in the intellectual brain trust of the neocons,
[00:46:33.462 --> 00:46:41.006]  And they're at forest gatherings, 15-day forest gatherings, with busloads of European male prostitutes being flown in.
[00:46:41.026 --> 00:46:43.648]  I mean, that's Washington Times, folks.
[00:46:44.128 --> 00:46:47.690]  David Gergen said, well, I don't run around naked like the other people in the orgies.
[00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:49.311]  That was the Washington Times.
[00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:51.112]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[00:46:51.152 --> 00:46:52.133]  Good to have you on board, Jim.
[00:46:52.933 --> 00:46:53.814]  Please spread the word.
[00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:56.515]  I mean, you can't write stuff this crazy.
[00:46:58.737 --> 00:47:00.138]  I didn't believe in Bohemian Grove.
[00:47:00.558 --> 00:47:02.399]  I'd read about it, I'd heard about it, I didn't believe it.
[00:47:03.653 --> 00:47:05.034]  I've read mainstream news articles.
[00:47:05.574 --> 00:47:08.296]  The British media says, Mr. Jones, we'd like to get you to sneak in.
[00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:09.216]  We really can't do it.
[00:47:09.757 --> 00:47:11.117]  But we're afraid to do it, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:11.137 --> 00:47:12.058]  We know you do things like this.
[00:47:12.078 --> 00:47:13.178]  Would you like to sneak into the Grove?
[00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:15.960]  I snuck in, and I saw it, folks.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.360]  Okay?
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.941]  I saw it with my own two eyes.
[00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:19.442]  I got video of it.
[00:47:21.585 --> 00:47:30.590]  We're in so much trouble, and you wonder how things have gotten so bad, is that when people have big gambling debts, and when people are into all this weird stuff, they can be compromised.
[00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.410]  They can be blackmailed.
[00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:32.191]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:34.352]  We know Mossad was blackmailing him.
[00:47:34.372 --> 00:47:37.173]  We know the Chinese were blackmailing him.
[00:47:38.274 --> 00:47:40.335]  And that same stuff's going on right now.
[00:47:41.656 --> 00:47:42.136]  Right now.
[00:47:43.817 --> 00:47:47.359]  So please spread the word about us there in D.C., Jim.
[00:47:48.379 --> 00:47:51.060]  For the listeners of WPLC, that's a great affiliate down there.
[00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:52.581]  We've just been on it about a month or so.
[00:47:53.182 --> 00:47:57.504]  We'll come back and talk to Pastor Don, John, and others and get into more of the news.
[00:47:58.224 --> 00:47:58.585]  But no!
[00:47:58.885 --> 00:48:11.852]  They're telling us, you've got to give your rights up, you aren't going to have any more liberty to save America, and then we're going to get anybody who's connected to terrorists, and then they're all in business with the Bin Ladens and construction deals and seven million dollar contracts to
[00:48:12.961 --> 00:48:13.762]  We're good to go.
[00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:39.616]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:44.640]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:50.505]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.745 --> 00:48:55.269]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:48:55.489 --> 00:49:02.635]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:49:02.655 --> 00:49:07.199]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.902]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:49:10.102 --> 00:49:16.828]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:49:49.133 --> 00:49:57.036]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:57.816]  I think so.

[00:51:06.954 --> 00:51:07.194]  I think so.
[00:51:39.167 --> 00:51:44.268]  You know, a lot of people write me and email me and say, oh Alex, you've got so much courage to do this.
[00:51:44.708 --> 00:51:47.369]  All I do is read out of the newspaper.
[00:51:47.469 --> 00:51:50.130]  All I do is go out on location and see what these people are doing.
[00:51:51.039 --> 00:51:53.660]  No, the government is destroying our liberties and our freedoms.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.100]  They're going after our guns.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.620]  They're getting rid of our border.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.081]  They're signing deals for a Pan-American Union.
[00:51:59.321 --> 00:52:01.222]  They're giving Social Security to illegals.
[00:52:01.902 --> 00:52:03.262]  They are getting rid of America!
[00:52:04.942 --> 00:52:06.323]  And I'm disgusted by it!
[00:52:08.263 --> 00:52:11.344]  I mean, you know, you take this story out of Mesa, Arizona.
[00:52:11.384 --> 00:52:14.885]  The family refused to take a hepatitis B shot with a newborn baby.
[00:52:16.269 --> 00:52:17.469]  They had no criminal record.
[00:52:17.489 --> 00:52:18.850]  They were a nice middle class family.
[00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:19.310]  They're there.
[00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.330]  They say, well, there's no law that we're going to arrest you if you don't take your kid.
[00:52:23.551 --> 00:52:27.232]  And then the same government won't take smallpox shots because they know it's dangerous.
[00:52:27.572 --> 00:52:31.633]  And I got all these articles now admitting that brain disorders and stuff is exploding.
[00:52:31.673 --> 00:52:32.953]  It is from the vaccines.
[00:52:33.293 --> 00:52:34.693]  They found the garbage in it.
[00:52:36.154 --> 00:52:37.834]  Leave us alone!
[00:52:39.115 --> 00:52:40.735]  Just leave us alone!
[00:52:42.446 --> 00:52:43.307]  Oh, they're not going to listen.
[00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:54.373]  They're used to feeding on people, they're on power trips, they're gobbling up sovereign countries, and now Crystal, and Rumsfeld, and Pearl, Pearl, is bragging last week at some White House dinner.
[00:52:54.613 --> 00:52:57.155]  Oh, don't worry, we'll be invading North Korea soon.
[00:52:57.175 --> 00:52:57.975]  Ha ha ha!
[00:52:58.476 --> 00:52:59.837]  They call him the Prince of Darkness.
[00:52:59.857 --> 00:53:00.877]  Now, this is not funny.
[00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:08.662]  And they go, oh, it's to free the world, as they mow down masses of protesters.
[00:53:08.722 --> 00:53:10.403]  It's Tiananmen Square every day in Iraq now.
[00:53:11.471 --> 00:53:23.517]  And then we're treated to our leader, our leader Bush, landing on a jet aircraft, on an aircraft carrier, in a military uniform, shades of Kim Jong-il and Stalin.
[00:53:23.537 --> 00:53:25.738]  I don't know about you folks, but I know history.
[00:53:25.758 --> 00:53:30.520]  When they start dressing up in military outfits and being seen with their troops every week, look out!
[00:53:34.342 --> 00:53:37.624]  And for all this disgusting talk about freedom for other countries,
[00:53:38.283 --> 00:53:39.783]  Folks, this government is not our government.
[00:53:39.843 --> 00:53:45.964]  It backs up all the dictator shifts, it gives them weapons, sets them up for default, and domestically is destroying our liberty.
[00:53:46.324 --> 00:54:02.427]  I mean, if the government was leaving us alone, and not trying to dumb our kids down, and not trying to ship heroin and cocaine in, and not doing all these things, they wanted to go invade a bunch of countries and, uh, you know, bring them real republics and really have elections, I'd go, well, man, you know, maybe so!
[00:54:03.588 --> 00:54:05.548]  Violates what George Washington said about
[00:54:06.856 --> 00:54:10.780]  You know, staying out of the other hemisphere, but... Okay!
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.023]  But no, you don't destroy everything that makes America, America.
[00:54:17.545 --> 00:54:19.147]  And by the way, there's more terror coming.
[00:54:19.167 --> 00:54:20.408]  I mean, the globalists have told you.
[00:54:20.468 --> 00:54:25.212]  They're going to continue to provide the terror until there's no liberty left and until you're totally enslaved.
[00:54:26.593 --> 00:54:28.495]  They're building the prison grid for you right now.
[00:54:29.685 --> 00:54:32.068]  I want you to know Bill Clinton, George Bush, they're just puppets.
[00:54:32.348 --> 00:54:33.289]  They're not running anything.
[00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:34.871]  They're little neocon front men.
[00:54:35.412 --> 00:54:36.473]  They're at the think tanks.
[00:54:37.815 --> 00:54:42.801]  They're running the policy and engineering some of it, but there are others behind the scenes that came up with these plans.
[00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:45.936]  And it's a very long-term plan, but going for a while.
[00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.157]  And that's why they're in control.
[00:54:47.337 --> 00:54:48.438]  Because they are ruthless.
[00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:51.039]  And that's their sick, deep, dark excuse.
[00:54:51.099 --> 00:54:53.721]  Well, if we didn't do it, somebody else would.
[00:54:53.961 --> 00:54:56.382]  You have no excuse for trying to dumb down our people.
[00:54:56.703 --> 00:54:58.744]  You have no excuse for bringing in the narcotics.
[00:54:59.184 --> 00:55:04.047]  You have no excuse for all the things you're involved in and what you do at Bohemian Grove and Skull & Bones.
[00:55:04.547 --> 00:55:05.027]  All of you.
[00:55:06.548 --> 00:55:09.610]  You've been around each other so long, you don't know how flipped out you are.
[00:55:10.973 --> 00:55:12.074]  Well, some of us aren't afraid.
[00:55:12.094 --> 00:55:15.017]  We'll stand up for humanity because it's people like us.
[00:55:15.458 --> 00:55:20.163]  It's the only reason we still have humanity to counterbalance the just insane filth out there.
[00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:28.372]  Before I end this hour, if you believe in what we're doing, you want to fight the New World Order, you want a tool to fight the New World Order, get my videos.
[00:55:29.509 --> 00:55:36.051]  I've produced eight of them, and we've proved that Global has carried out 9-1-1, and we've proved they're going to carry out more, and we've proved that they're enslaving you and your family.

[00:55:55.964 --> 00:55:59.986]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 is the toll free number to order 1-888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9 or in full wars.com or net.
[00:56:00.006 --> 00:56:01.166]  Again that's 888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:56:01.186 --> 00:56:03.467]  Defending the Republic against the forces of Satan.
[00:56:21.644 --> 00:56:23.465]  Got three dollars in your pocket?
[00:56:23.665 --> 00:56:26.507]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:31.550]  Call and compare.
[00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:39.736]  For example... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:47.890]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:49.631]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.331 --> 00:56:51.452]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.092 --> 00:56:52.912]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.672 --> 00:56:54.573]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.233 --> 00:56:58.934]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:03.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:13.479 --> 00:57:17.081]  There has been a science that no one wants to talk about or discuss.
[00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:22.023]  It's the science of dumbing you down, making you love your captors.
[00:57:22.043 --> 00:57:25.424]  The science of slavery, of feudalism, of serfdom.
[00:57:26.645 --> 00:57:33.207]  And all those that struggle to break free of those bonds, and then we become fat and happy and enter into slavery yet again.
[00:57:33.568 --> 00:57:36.629]  We are facing the ultimate and final slavery of the technocracy.
[00:57:37.296 --> 00:57:38.416]  Total dehumanization.
[00:57:38.436 --> 00:57:40.317]  We must resist it for future generations.
[00:57:40.797 --> 00:57:42.017]  But not just future generations.
[00:57:42.497 --> 00:57:44.258]  For ourselves and our children today.
[00:57:44.278 --> 00:57:47.939]  The New World Order is run by totally ruthless sharks.
[00:57:49.539 --> 00:57:52.200]  Mafia dons on insane power trips.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.161]  And they must be resisted.
[00:57:55.201 --> 00:57:59.462]  The Neocons are their current manifestation of the scam.
[00:57:59.482 --> 00:58:00.842]  The wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:58:01.702 --> 00:58:03.463]  As they stick the knife in our back.
[00:58:04.324 --> 00:58:05.405]  Giving us the New World Order.
[00:58:05.425 --> 00:58:09.267]  And I talked about Bechtel tied to Bin Laden's, the big group getting the contracts in Iraq.
[00:58:09.668 --> 00:58:11.149]  Then you got Halliburton tied to them.
[00:58:11.629 --> 00:58:14.531]  You got Rumsfeld tied to North Korea and the nuke transfers.
[00:58:15.471 --> 00:58:16.632]  It goes on and on.
[00:58:16.652 --> 00:58:19.714]  And that headline, Neoconservatives push for a New World Order.
[00:58:21.716 --> 00:58:23.657]  Couldn't say it any more succinctly.
[00:58:23.677 --> 00:58:26.399]  Also, autism vaccines link considered.
[00:58:26.439 --> 00:58:28.720]  An epidemic of autism and other brain problems in America.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:34.084]  Children is linked to vaccines, say doctors, activists, a member of Congress who met in Chicago over the weekend.
[00:58:35.615 --> 00:58:40.159]  States urge to revise smallpox plans because they can't get any of the feds to take it.
[00:58:40.639 --> 00:58:45.643]  And I got an article where they're trying to arrest parents who won't give their kids vaccines, though there's no law.
[00:58:46.443 --> 00:58:49.205]  They just arrest people now without a law, folks.
[00:58:49.806 --> 00:58:52.548]  We've now entered super twilight tyranny land.
[00:58:53.385 --> 00:58:55.866]  Because the feds have mandated you inject them with this.
[00:58:55.986 --> 00:58:57.647]  We want to x-ray the eggs.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:58:59.348]  We want to dumb down population.
[00:58:59.828 --> 00:59:03.150]  They've been caught adding a hormone to these vaccines that cause cerebral cortex damage.
[00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:06.372]  It attacks brain development in small children.
[00:59:07.953 --> 00:59:09.053]  Why put up with this nightmare?
[00:59:09.073 --> 00:59:10.694]  Why not wake up to it and say no to it?
[00:59:11.154 --> 00:59:13.376]  Stop being idiots and happily going along with it.
[00:59:14.136 --> 00:59:16.217]  Let's talk to Pastor Don in Missouri.
[00:59:16.237 --> 00:59:19.879]  Then we'll go to Gene, Andrew, Charles, Tom, and others.
[00:59:19.919 --> 00:59:20.379]  Go ahead.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:21.760]  You're on the air, Don.
[00:59:22.219 --> 00:59:23.181]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[00:59:23.401 --> 00:59:23.822]  Pretty good.
[00:59:24.403 --> 00:59:26.185]  You know, you gave me a great segue there.
[00:59:26.205 --> 00:59:27.467]  You know, why don't people wake up to it?
[00:59:27.487 --> 00:59:28.970]  That was exactly why I was calling you.
[00:59:29.689 --> 00:59:32.130]  I talk all the time, and I don't just talk the gospel.
[00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:36.152]  I tell people that resistance to tyranny is, in fact, obedience unto God.
[00:59:36.592 --> 00:59:37.953]  Very few preachers preach that.
[00:59:38.653 --> 00:59:49.219]  And one of the reasons, one of the things that I see in people is they, first of all, they can't fathom the depths of the evil intents from the maniacs that are leading us.
[00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:52.480]  They can't fathom that these people could have this kind of evil intent.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.541]  Well, that's naive.
[00:59:54.601 --> 00:59:56.382]  It's happened over and over again in history.
[00:59:56.722 --> 00:59:57.222]  Absolutely.
[00:59:57.242 --> 00:59:58.463]  And then when you show them
[00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:03.330]  What you or I would call proof, frequently they don't know how to read between the lines.
[01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:08.615]  And I saw three things in the last month or so that I wanted to bring to your attention.
[01:00:09.016 --> 01:00:10.357]  One just happened over the last weekend.
[01:00:10.377 --> 01:00:19.706]  Did you see in Iraq that they discovered that a nuclear facility had been looted of all of its excess waste or plutonium or whatever it was?
[01:00:20.466 --> 01:00:22.008]  And now they're wondering who has it?
[01:00:22.805 --> 01:00:25.327]  Yeah, now it must be in Syria better to attack them.
[01:00:25.868 --> 01:00:36.037]  Well, the whole point of that is, if you read between the lines a little bit, you realize that they knew that facility was there, and we sent troops in to guard all the oil wells, why didn't they guard that facility?
[01:00:37.018 --> 01:00:38.660]  Only reason is because they didn't want to.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:45.406]  Well, they've got to create places where they can later say, oh, this group got a dirty bomb,
[01:00:46.047 --> 01:00:46.887]  From Saddam.
[01:00:46.928 --> 01:00:49.229]  Saddam's got secret teams in America.
[01:00:49.749 --> 01:00:53.551]  And then no one asked, well, wait, these secret teams were brought here by Bush Sr.
[01:00:53.631 --> 01:00:56.973]  and Clinton and were involved in Oklahoma City working for the CIA.
[01:00:56.993 --> 01:00:58.234]  They don't work for Saddam.
[01:00:58.534 --> 01:00:58.994]  Absolutely.
[01:00:59.014 --> 01:01:04.037]  It's just a matter of connecting the dots and taking the evidence that you see in front of you and realizing that it is, in fact, evidence.
[01:01:05.157 --> 01:01:10.100]  Last, I think, maybe two months ago in New York, they passed or were working on passing
[01:01:10.882 --> 01:01:18.626]  A local ordinance or a local law making it illegal to possess a camera in New York City on the streets.
[01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.388]  They said it was to protect us from terrorism.
[01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:23.629]  Oh yes, they're going to have their cameras.
[01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:24.369]  I know, I saw that.
[01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:27.131]  They're going to have cameras everywhere, but we can't have cameras.
[01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:28.632]  You starting to figure out how great this is?
[01:01:28.832 --> 01:01:29.232]  Exactly.
[01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.834]  I mean, New York City's been photographed a thousand times over.
[01:01:32.214 --> 01:01:32.834]  Well, don't worry.
[01:01:32.854 --> 01:01:37.677]  You can get a special permit from them if you can be trusted to have a camera.
[01:01:38.883 --> 01:01:40.905]  Even in Communist China you can have cameras.
[01:01:43.608 --> 01:01:46.710]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:46.991 --> 01:01:49.553]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio.

[01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:14.529]  Included accessories.

[01:02:21.652 --> 01:02:25.093]  Also a one-year full factory warranty on parts and labor.

[01:02:26.814 --> 01:02:26.994]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:02:27.014 --> 01:02:27.254]  Call today.
[01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:45.846]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:02:46.527 --> 01:02:47.808]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:02:48.008 --> 01:02:53.752]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:02:54.032 --> 01:02:59.296]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:03.699]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:03:03.939 --> 01:03:07.681]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:12.583]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:03:12.683 --> 01:03:18.926]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.966 --> 01:03:20.787]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:03:21.267 --> 01:03:23.349]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[01:03:39.021 --> 01:03:41.063]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:03:41.832 --> 01:03:43.433]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:03:43.793 --> 01:03:49.535]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:03:49.795 --> 01:03:54.917]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:03:55.257 --> 01:04:04.541]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:09.844]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:04:10.165 --> 01:04:14.187]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:19.171]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:04:19.531 --> 01:04:25.415]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:04:25.755 --> 01:04:34.804]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:04:34.984 --> 01:04:38.167]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.088 --> 01:04:40.189]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:45.814]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:46.355 --> 01:04:49.157]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:53.766 --> 01:04:57.029]  Yeah, about three weeks ago, I saw the article and I mentioned it on air.
[01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:59.771]  There's so much stuff like this now, we just kind of glaze over it.
[01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:02.293]  I guess it's the point of tyranny, it just overwhelms you.
[01:05:03.554 --> 01:05:05.716]  Don, in Missouri, you mentioned New York.
[01:05:05.816 --> 01:05:11.320]  They said, yeah, we want to pass a law where you can't have cameras or photograph buildings, really, of any type.
[01:05:12.681 --> 01:05:14.663]  People kind of said, wait a minute, there's cameras everywhere.
[01:05:14.683 --> 01:05:16.344]  You can look at the city cameras on the internet.
[01:05:16.605 --> 01:05:19.527]  People can hide cameras as if a real terrorist wouldn't be able to hide one.
[01:05:20.327 --> 01:05:23.871]  This is about them saying, turn that camera off when and how they want.
[01:05:24.232 --> 01:05:30.819]  We've had police here when we're downtown, and they're beating people up or, you know, doing something, and they'll walk over and say, turn that camera off!
[01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:33.282]  And we go, uh, First Amendment!
[01:05:34.203 --> 01:05:34.764]  Absolutely.
[01:05:35.084 --> 01:05:39.450]  And they'll try to yell at us, we'll say, hey, come on, this is America, don't act like that, and they'll usually back off.
[01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:45.314]  Yeah, under this new thing, it'll be selectively enforced, you see.
[01:05:45.654 --> 01:05:49.299]  And worse than Russia or China, but it's for America.
[01:05:49.319 --> 01:05:59.751]  Now, when the towers got taken down by the CIA, when the globalists did that, when that happened, you notice FEMA wouldn't let anybody take photographs.
[01:06:00.504 --> 01:06:09.788]  And they tore up the metal, the machinery, all the parts, and shipped it to Communist China, the Firefighting Association, National Firefighters Association, the oldest group in the country.
[01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:13.230]  Firefighter engineering said that it was a crime scene being covered up.
[01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:17.292]  The firemen's radios did not malfunction.
[01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:23.435]  Under national security directive, they grabbed all those tapes and interviews and told the firefighters not to talk.
[01:06:24.035 --> 01:06:27.337]  Though parts of those transcripts were released, bombs were going off,
[01:06:28.057 --> 01:06:28.377]  Go ahead.
[01:06:28.397 --> 01:06:29.138]  You got any comments?
[01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:30.278]  Absolutely.
[01:06:30.358 --> 01:06:30.799]  You're correct.
[01:06:30.819 --> 01:06:36.922]  You see, what's happened is that technology has marched forward and it has empowered the globalists.
[01:06:36.982 --> 01:06:38.763]  It has also empowered common people.
[01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:48.428]  Because now anybody can go get a digital camcorder for $600 or $500, whatever the number is, or get a digital still camera for the same kind of money.
[01:06:48.748 --> 01:06:51.890]  And people can record things that they may perhaps not want recorded.
[01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:56.653]  For example, no one would today know what really happened in Dallas if Abraham Zabruder didn't have that little 8mm
[01:06:58.356 --> 01:07:05.302]  Well, everybody knows that the back of the head doesn't blow off when you're shot in the back of the head.
[01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:05.982]  Absolutely.
[01:07:06.042 --> 01:07:07.423]  And yet, there it is on film.
[01:07:07.483 --> 01:07:11.246]  And so I believe that they're concerned about that kind of stuff being caught on tape.
[01:07:11.367 --> 01:07:15.710]  And people need to read between the lines and hold our people in check as much as possible.
[01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:22.055]  Well, I mean, imagine how delusional it is, though, that they're putting up cameras everywhere but then trying to say we can't have cameras.
[01:07:22.115 --> 01:07:22.616]  I mean, it's just...
[01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:29.370]  It's so insane, and then anything they say about anti-terrorism is a joke, because the borders are wide open.
[01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:29.991]  Thanks for the call.
[01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:30.751]  Alex?
[01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:31.312]  Yeah?
[01:07:31.412 --> 01:07:34.253]  I was in Minneapolis last week, and there's one more story I thought you'd appreciate.
[01:07:34.753 --> 01:07:41.818]  On April 22nd, the headline of the Star Tribune, banks give thumbs up to fingerprinting for all new accounts.
[01:07:42.498 --> 01:07:43.719]  Yeah, I covered that.
[01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:51.083]  The whole state, even if you have a bank account, they're putting in inkless thumb scanners, and how many years have I warned people?
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.902]  This is the Cashless Society Taxation Control Grid.
[01:07:55.323 --> 01:07:55.843]  Absolutely.
[01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:57.084]  You're doing a great job.
[01:07:57.124 --> 01:07:57.805]  Keep up the good work.
[01:07:57.965 --> 01:07:58.765]  Alright, thank you.
[01:07:58.785 --> 01:07:59.626]  And there's more of us.
[01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:02.709]  There's millions of us speaking up and telling the truth.
[01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:03.909]  And they can't get all of us.
[01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:05.451]  They can't frame all of us.
[01:08:05.491 --> 01:08:06.612]  They can't kill all of us.
[01:08:07.032 --> 01:08:08.293]  And that's why they know they're in trouble.
[01:08:08.313 --> 01:08:10.014]  Because there's more of us standing up every day.
[01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:11.495]  And more people waking up.
[01:08:11.856 --> 01:08:14.198]  And you take the firefighters, police, and others.
[01:08:15.779 --> 01:08:18.381]  They just refuse now to take the smallpox shot.
[01:08:19.836 --> 01:08:23.218]  Out of 11 million they wanted to take it, it's only in the hundreds, folks.
[01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:24.918]  Their whole program is failing.
[01:08:25.339 --> 01:08:32.902]  How can the globalists release smallpox then to get a total police state crackdown during the alerts if they can't get their own minions to follow orders?
[01:08:35.764 --> 01:08:41.786]  So see, it's like with Ceausescu, that little dictator, over in Eastern Europe.
[01:08:42.467 --> 01:08:43.887]  You know, everybody was sick of it.
[01:08:44.007 --> 01:08:45.088]  Everybody knew it was a lie.
[01:08:45.228 --> 01:08:47.349]  And finally people started to speak up and get involved.
[01:08:48.092 --> 01:08:49.512]  But here we don't have a dictator.
[01:08:50.513 --> 01:08:58.914]  We have a corrupt central bank that's got puppets in the House, the Senate, the Judiciary, and the Executive who just follow their orders.
[01:08:58.954 --> 01:09:02.775]  Just get their little marching orders right out of the think tanks for the big bankers.
[01:09:03.635 --> 01:09:15.098]  The bankers have said, get control of these people, get them tagged, get leases on them, get them under control, because we're going into the future and the elite wants all the life extension and all the new advanced technologies for themselves.
[01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:16.458]  They don't want you to have access to it.
[01:09:18.507 --> 01:09:19.868]  And that's really the big prize.
[01:09:19.908 --> 01:09:31.634]  They've got to have you dumbed down in kind of a suboid dark ages down here while they build technological pillars of control and parallel societies that are much more advanced than what we even know is going on.
[01:09:31.974 --> 01:09:33.615]  That's really the key to the New World Order.
[01:09:34.535 --> 01:09:36.796]  So your humanity should cry out against them.
[01:09:37.477 --> 01:09:41.278]  Your humanity should resist them and realize their paradigm and defeat them.
[01:09:41.599 --> 01:09:42.499]  It's got to be done.
[01:09:42.539 --> 01:09:44.340]  In fact, we're even helping the globalists.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.122]  These self-destructive idiots are just out of control.
[01:09:48.955 --> 01:09:53.056]  I was listening the other day, driving in my car, and I happened to turn on Rush Slackjaw.
[01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:17.734]  He was talking about... So wait, you turned into the ultra-liberal, and the neocon, and Bush is a communitarian.
[01:10:17.754 --> 01:10:20.896]  You know what the dictionary 20 years ago said about communitarian?
[01:10:21.636 --> 01:10:21.816]  No.
[01:10:22.316 --> 01:10:24.137]  One who promotes communist systems.
[01:10:24.998 --> 01:10:27.919]  Bush's press release for the election, I'm a communitarian.
[01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:30.180]  What did the communitarian Rush Limbaugh say?
[01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:38.905]  He was talking about when Bush landed on the aircraft carrier, and people were talking about how much money it was a waste and all that.
[01:10:39.853 --> 01:10:48.977]  Of course, supporting Bush 100% and saying, well, gee, he was in the fighter guard because he used to be an ex-fighter jock and all this.
[01:10:49.797 --> 01:10:52.638]  I said, wait a minute, his dad was an ex-fighter jock?
[01:10:53.118 --> 01:11:01.281]  But it turned out, then I heard on the Power Hour about the website AOLBush.com and I checked that all out.
[01:11:01.862 --> 01:11:07.784]  I guess he did fly 104s in the National Guard for a couple of years.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.721]  But then he went AWOL on that.
[01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:13.744]  He didn't even show up for his duty and wouldn't take his medical checkup.
[01:11:13.764 --> 01:11:20.590]  Wait, wait, you're telling me Rush implied that Bush had been in the military and then got into the Guard?
[01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:24.333]  No, he just referred to him as an ex-fighter jock.
[01:11:25.234 --> 01:11:26.895]  He said he was a fighter jock.
[01:11:27.275 --> 01:11:28.877]  Well, let me tell you what happened.
[01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.098]  Sir, we have the documents from his release.
[01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:33.000]  He showed up for a couple weeks.
[01:11:33.852 --> 01:11:42.258]  Almost crashed a couple times and was such a horrible pilot and then didn't show up ever again, actually went AWOL and nothing was done.
[01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.140]  Yeah, they have all that on that website.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.481]  It's well documented.
[01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:49.784]  Well, Daddy was director of the CIA, so you don't... Right.
[01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:55.808]  But the insinuation, you know, when he says ex-fighter Jack, that insinuates to me that he saw war.
[01:11:56.329 --> 01:12:00.572]  In the Air National Guard, all he did was fly around in the skies a little bit.
[01:12:00.632 --> 01:12:01.693]  Well, he didn't really do that.
[01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:07.458]  Supposedly, I mean, it's truly been in the news that the guy was one of the worst pilots they'd ever seen.
[01:12:07.478 --> 01:12:18.101]  Yeah, well, I heard a quote by him in some place where he said that the reason he got into the Guard was because they realized that he would be one of the best pilots in the world.
[01:12:18.602 --> 01:12:20.342]  One of the best pilots ever.
[01:12:20.822 --> 01:12:29.945]  And it's just such a crock because you've got Rush and these other guys all pumping him up as some kind of an ex-fighter jock and you check the truth out and it's
[01:12:31.169 --> 01:12:40.431]  It's such a bunch of lies that anymore I can't hardly listen to any radio station because I either get angry or I break up laughing one or the other, you know.
[01:12:40.451 --> 01:12:42.972]  And I would guess you probably consider yourself to be a conservative.
[01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.273]  Anymore, I don't know what I consider myself.
[01:12:46.313 --> 01:12:47.593]  Well, I mean in the past.
[01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:49.954]  The point is you're not on what they call a liberal.
[01:12:50.524 --> 01:12:50.984]  No, I'm okay.
[01:12:51.004 --> 01:12:53.025]  Did you hear about the private Lynch thing?
[01:12:53.385 --> 01:12:56.706]  Totally fake, totally made up, totally staged.
[01:12:57.026 --> 01:13:14.711]  For two days, the doctors were calling the military less than a mile away, walking to them, going, we have some of your people, we have one of your people, we're taking care of her, there's no troops here, they knew that the guard and others had pulled out two days before, they have this big staged event, and they made it up that Lynch
[01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:18.853]  Fought him hand-to-hand with daggers and was taking fire.
[01:13:18.873 --> 01:13:21.094]  It was like Audie Murphy turned out all lies.
[01:13:21.555 --> 01:13:22.855]  He was hiding under a blanket.
[01:13:23.235 --> 01:13:24.356]  She hid the first time.
[01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:25.877]  Fine, I'm glad they saved her.
[01:13:26.377 --> 01:13:28.518]  Now they just lie about everything.
[01:13:29.299 --> 01:13:36.323]  You know how dangerous it is when they just lie and you've got our war emperor landing on aircraft carriers in military outfits?
[01:13:36.363 --> 01:13:37.423]  How dangerous that is?
[01:13:37.903 --> 01:13:40.545]  That's what we always saw in Russia and Germany and China.
[01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:44.769]  So anymore, I guess I would just consider myself a strict constitutionalist.
[01:13:44.829 --> 01:13:46.930]  I don't go for any of those other labels.
[01:13:47.711 --> 01:13:53.016]  But talking about your lies and propaganda, I remember in 1974 I went to the World's Fair.
[01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:58.141]  And the theme of that World's Fair was ecology.
[01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:06.248]  And the worst exhibit there, the most propagandized exhibit, was the Russian exhibit at that World's Fair.
[01:14:06.795 --> 01:14:11.398]  And you go through the Russian exhibit from one end to the other, all they said was how wonderful it was in Russia.
[01:14:11.438 --> 01:14:16.561]  There was no pollution, the waters were clean, the air was clean, all this stuff.
[01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:19.302]  It was exactly the opposite of what was reality.
[01:14:19.903 --> 01:14:27.227]  But now we're turning into the same kind of a system that I saw in 1974 in the World's Fair in the Russian exhibit.
[01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:32.330]  Well, I'll be honest, if it was a new world, I'd leave.
[01:14:33.527 --> 01:14:44.551]  I love America, and my family's been in the Texas Independence fight, and for the battle for independence in 1776, but I gotta tell you... I'd be moving down there, I'll tell you.
[01:14:44.631 --> 01:14:45.111]  Well, I hear you.
[01:14:45.151 --> 01:14:49.892]  We need some states to break off, break away, get out of this thing, and, you know, get back to America.
[01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.694]  The real United States, because this isn't the federal government.
[01:14:54.074 --> 01:14:56.715]  People running the federal government, they're the enemy combatants.
[01:14:57.575 --> 01:15:00.636]  They are the people that have overthrown America and need to be arrested.
[01:15:01.528 --> 01:15:02.628]  And I'm just so sick of it.
[01:15:02.688 --> 01:15:05.629]  I mean, yeah, let's arrest people that arm North Korea with nuclear reactors.
[01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:07.009]  Okay, Rumsfeld?
[01:15:07.789 --> 01:15:08.549]  You go first.
[01:15:09.049 --> 01:15:11.070]  Let's arrest people that are in business with Bin Laden.
[01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:12.810]  Well, that's the entire Bush family.
[01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:14.910]  You know, this is the reality here.
[01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:17.611]  And so the reality's bizarre and scary.
[01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:18.391]  Well, that's the facts.
[01:15:18.771 --> 01:15:19.751]  Thanks for joining us, man.
[01:15:19.791 --> 01:15:20.291]  You take care.
[01:15:21.192 --> 01:15:21.672]  Good to hear from you.
[01:15:21.692 --> 01:15:26.053]  We'll come back and talk to Andrew and Charlie and Tom and Larry and everybody else.
[01:15:26.653 --> 01:15:27.193]  But look at this.
[01:15:27.253 --> 01:15:28.233]  The real saving
[01:15:29.201 --> 01:15:35.004]  Private Lynch, and it says, uh, Iraq's medical staff tell a different story than the U.S.
[01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:35.564]  military.
[01:15:35.604 --> 01:15:36.905]  We all became friends with her.
[01:15:37.325 --> 01:15:38.586]  We liked her so much.
[01:15:38.706 --> 01:15:54.954]  And now Lynch has spoken out, despite being told not to, and said, yeah, they did help me, and the Iraqis were gone for days, and they took care of me, and there were no troops, and... And it says, Hollywood could ever hope to have in a movie was there in this extraordinary feat of rescue, except perhaps the truth.
[01:15:57.142 --> 01:16:06.468]  And it goes on that the three doctors and nurses, one hospital administrator, and local residents interviewed us separately last week by the Toronto Star Investigation.
[01:16:06.988 --> 01:16:08.489]  Now World Night Daily's done one too.
[01:16:08.989 --> 01:16:09.629]  The men agrees.
[01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:11.330]  The medical team cared for Lynch.
[01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.472]  The hospital, formerly known as Saddam Hospital, is only now beginning.
[01:16:14.873 --> 01:16:18.915]  Appreciate how grand the myth was built up around the four hours the U.S.
[01:16:18.995 --> 01:16:22.337]  raiding party spent early on April Fool's Day.
[01:16:23.238 --> 01:16:24.098]  Yeah, April Fool's Day.
[01:16:24.118 --> 01:16:25.699]  It's always a sick joke by the globalists.
[01:16:26.388 --> 01:16:27.429]  And they are disappointed.
[01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:32.753]  And it turns out that the Rockies have been gone for days.
[01:16:33.294 --> 01:16:34.715]  She was being well taken care of.
[01:16:35.555 --> 01:16:39.719]  When the troops came in, well, I'll tell you about it when we get back and we'll go to your calls.
[01:16:40.539 --> 01:16:41.000]  Stay with me.

[01:17:51.868 --> 01:18:03.135]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:18:03.295 --> 01:18:06.017]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:18:06.357 --> 01:18:10.460]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.801]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:18:12.961 --> 01:18:14.823]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:21.046]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.

[01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:47.313]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:47.753 --> 01:18:52.296]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:52.676 --> 01:18:57.539]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.721]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:59.761 --> 01:19:00.761]  can barely be read.
[01:19:00.781 --> 01:19:02.042]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:06.265]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[01:19:42.535 --> 01:19:45.997]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[01:20:42.788 --> 01:20:44.809]  Alright my friends, we're back live again.
[01:20:44.829 --> 01:20:46.090]  Thanks for joining me today.
[01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:47.691]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:47.731 --> 01:20:50.592]  Websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:09.184]  Continuing from this article out of Canada, the Toronto Star, but WorldNetDaily has the same thing to say.
[01:21:09.204 --> 01:21:18.671]  The most important thing to know is that the Iraqi soldiers and commanders had left the hospital, it's a private lynch story, almost two days earlier.
[01:21:19.597 --> 01:21:23.178]  The night they left, a few of the senior medical staff tried to give Jessica back.
[01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:30.061]  They carefully moved her out of the intensive care and into an ambulance, and began to drive the Americans, who were just one kilometer away.
[01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:33.442]  When the ambulance got within 300 meters, they began to shoot.
[01:21:33.903 --> 01:21:36.864]  There wasn't even a chance to tell them, we have Jessica Taker.
[01:21:37.644 --> 01:21:39.265]  One night later, the raid unfolded.
[01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:41.585]  Osam Hamoud, 35, a waiter,
[01:21:43.747 --> 01:21:49.751]  At a restaurant describes the preamble when he was approached outside his home near the hospital by U.S.
[01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:53.793]  Special Forces troops accompanied by an Arabic translator from Qatar.
[01:21:54.313 --> 01:21:57.815]  They asked me if any troops were still inside the hospital and I said no.
[01:21:58.236 --> 01:21:59.056]  They're all gone.
[01:21:59.076 --> 01:22:02.198]  Then they asked me about Uday Hussein and again I said no.
[01:22:03.399 --> 01:22:07.621]  The translator seemed satisfied with my answers but the soldiers were very nervous.
[01:22:08.822 --> 01:22:12.664]  Well, yeah, it's not like Waco, the usual Delta Force mission these days.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:20.503]  At midnight, the sound of helicopters circling the hospital's upper floors sent staff scurrying for x-ray department.
[01:22:20.943 --> 01:22:29.427]  Only part of the hospital with no outside windows, the power was cut, followed by small explosions as the raiding teams blasted through locked doors.
[01:22:29.447 --> 01:22:32.468]  A few minutes later, they heard the men's voice shout, Go!
[01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:32.788]  Go!
[01:22:32.908 --> 01:22:33.088]  Go!
[01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:33.549]  in English.
[01:22:33.989 --> 01:22:35.429]  Seconds later, the door burst open.
[01:22:35.489 --> 01:22:38.831]  A red laser, like the darkness, framed on the forehead of the chief resident.
[01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.494]  We were pretty frightened.
[01:22:41.075 --> 01:22:46.857]  There were about 40 medical staff together in the x-ray department, said Dr. Amar Uday, 24.
[01:22:46.957 --> 01:22:48.417]  Everybody expected the Americans to come.
[01:22:48.817 --> 01:22:53.759]  Then that day, because the city had fallen, we didn't expect them to blast through the doors like a Hollywood movie.
[01:22:54.419 --> 01:22:55.920]  Well, there's cameras there, folks.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.500]  It's a movie.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.981]  They know the city's fallen, and everybody's pulled out.
[01:22:59.001 --> 01:23:04.183]  They've sent in intel folks to gather intelligence, and now it's part of a staged event.
[01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:11.796]  Another doctor, 27, observed dryly that two cameramen in the still-photographer Olsen uniform accompanied the U.S.
[01:23:11.836 --> 01:23:12.716]  team to the hospital.
[01:23:12.756 --> 01:23:14.438]  Maybe this was a movie after all.
[01:23:15.539 --> 01:23:22.925]  Separately, the Iraqi doctors described how the tension fell away rapidly once the Americans realized no threat existed on the premises.
[01:23:23.305 --> 01:23:23.566]  The U.S.
[01:23:23.646 --> 01:23:28.570]  medic was led to Lynch's room, as others secured the rest of the three-wing hospital.
[01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:32.974]  Several staff and patients were placed in plastic handcuffs, including, according to
[01:23:33.797 --> 01:23:40.159]  Husuma, one Iraqi civilian who was already immobilized with abdominal wounds from an earlier explosion.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:50.883]  One group of soldiers returned to the x-ray room to ask about the bodies of missing soldiers and was led to a graveyard opposite the hospital south wall.
[01:23:51.043 --> 01:23:52.944]  All were dead on arrival, the doctors say.
[01:23:52.964 --> 01:23:56.565]  The whole thing lasted about four hours, another doctor said.
[01:23:56.585 --> 01:23:58.505]  When they left, they turned to us and said, thank you.
[01:23:59.166 --> 01:23:59.806]  That was it.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.822]  And then they said they were shocked by the story that was then told on the news.
[01:24:04.902 --> 01:24:06.003]  It was completely untrue.
[01:24:06.023 --> 01:24:07.964]  It's a seven-page article.
[01:24:09.865 --> 01:24:21.331]  And Jessica Lynch admits in statements she's made that what the Muslims, what the Arabs, what the Iraqis, I should say, are saying is true.
[01:24:23.092 --> 01:24:27.434]  So more lies, more staged garbage.
[01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:30.856]  Again, this government could care less about the troops.
[01:24:31.056 --> 01:24:33.297]  Our troops were hit with chemical weapons in the first Cold War.
[01:24:33.998 --> 01:24:37.860]  The bunker's being blown up to cover up the evidence of who sold it to the Iraqis, our government.
[01:24:39.301 --> 01:24:40.301]  Our troops huffed it.
[01:24:40.802 --> 01:24:42.783]  Thousands of chemical weapons detectors went off.
[01:24:42.823 --> 01:24:43.803]  They were not given treatment.
[01:24:43.823 --> 01:24:47.605]  So I don't want to hear, listen to you boy, you don't support the troops.
[01:24:47.705 --> 01:24:48.366]  Yes, I do.
[01:24:49.066 --> 01:24:49.586]  Yes, I do.
[01:24:49.906 --> 01:24:55.529]  I'm tired of our troops getting left behind in real wars, being hit with weapons, not being treated.
[01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:56.550]  I'm tired of it.
[01:24:58.129 --> 01:25:05.454]  And I don't like our troops being used, as Knight Ridder News Service says today, neoconservatives push for a new world order.
[01:25:07.695 --> 01:25:17.721]  And Bush has said this weekend from Crawford, I want to say hi to the president, we know he doesn't really run anything, he's a puppet, but he can listen to me on News Talk 1260 when he's vacationing.
[01:25:18.962 --> 01:25:21.764]  Oh yes, we're transmitters right by the ranch.
[01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:23.585]  Listen to us on News Talk 1260, KWNX.
[01:25:25.652 --> 01:25:29.713]  You can now listen to us up in D.C., but again, I have nothing really against Bush.
[01:25:30.354 --> 01:25:32.774]  Bush is more of a puppet than Bill Clinton.
[01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:36.176]  Bill Clinton was really in there, enjoyed all of it.
[01:25:37.096 --> 01:25:44.599]  Bush is really just reading off a teleprompter and, hey, thanks, Daddy, it's great to be able to preside over the New World Order and the end of America.
[01:25:45.959 --> 01:25:47.360]  So let's get past Bush.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:53.362]  I just have to get past Bush because a lot of conservatives go, everything's alright, Bush is in office.
[01:25:53.422 --> 01:25:54.122]  Well, no.
[01:25:55.225 --> 01:25:58.687]  I mean, the guy's got a voting record, a signing record, like Chuck Schumer.
[01:25:59.187 --> 01:25:59.688]  Literally.
[01:25:59.948 --> 01:26:03.810]  They've written articles about how these two are allies now, and friends.
[01:26:05.111 --> 01:26:05.992]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:26:06.652 --> 01:26:07.993]  I love the Second Amendment.
[01:26:08.773 --> 01:26:09.934]  I love our sovereignty.
[01:26:09.994 --> 01:26:10.955]  It's all disappearing.
[01:26:11.275 --> 01:26:13.036]  Whether it's Bill Clinton or George Bush.
[01:26:13.476 --> 01:26:14.257]  It's gotta stop.
[01:26:15.698 --> 01:26:20.541]  Gene, Andrew, Charles, Tom, Larry, others, we'll get to your calls when we get back.
[01:26:20.641 --> 01:26:22.442]  A bunch of other news I haven't hit on.
[01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:27.054]  I'm fired up about freedom.
[01:26:28.335 --> 01:26:29.635]  I love America.
[01:26:30.436 --> 01:26:31.456]  We're gonna resist tyranny.
[01:26:33.257 --> 01:26:34.177]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.637 --> 01:26:36.258]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.178 --> 01:26:40.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:49.143]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:26:49.738 --> 01:26:51.158]  It is the nature of wicked control freaks to want more.
[01:26:51.179 --> 01:26:52.539]  The globalists basically own it all, run it all,
[01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:20.412]  But they want more.
[01:27:21.392 --> 01:27:42.887]  There's a few dirt poor backward countries around the globe, I was about to say companies is really what they are, rival companies, that the globalists don't own fully or control fully, so they're going to have this big global world war three to take all those groups over and to have the pretext to get you behind these aggressive pre-emptive wars.
[01:27:44.088 --> 01:27:48.631]  The globalists have provided terror attacks and they said they would do so in their own policy reports.
[01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:52.972]  Put out by the Neocons at the Project for a New American Century Foundation.
[01:27:53.653 --> 01:27:59.037]  Brzezinski, founder of the Trilateral Commission, said in his own book in 98, and they've done it.
[01:27:59.618 --> 01:28:01.159]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:09.647]  And before I go back to the news and these loaded phones, it's very important that I talk about, well, my videos.
[01:28:09.767 --> 01:28:13.190]  I mean, they really are powerful films, and they really do affect change.
[01:28:15.766 --> 01:28:22.509]  We are able to wake up 90% of those that see the videos.
[01:28:22.529 --> 01:28:35.216]  90% of those that see the documentary films, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror Exposed, are waking up.
[01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:36.977]  They could be black, they could be white.
[01:28:37.357 --> 01:28:39.658]  They could be a northerner, a southerner, a westerner.
[01:28:40.379 --> 01:28:51.162]  They're waking up when they see 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, when they see The Masters of Terror, when they read my book, 9-1-1, The Sentence to Tyranny, because it's all in your face mainstream.
[01:28:51.722 --> 01:28:59.364]  The public Northwoods document is covered in The Road to Tyranny, and in the book, The Sentence to Tyranny, where the U.S.
[01:28:59.424 --> 01:29:05.146]  government explains why it wants to kill Americans in terror attacks to be blamed on foreign enemies.
[01:29:05.931 --> 01:29:07.612]  How casualty lists in U.S.
[01:29:07.672 --> 01:29:10.633]  newspapers will cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[01:29:12.114 --> 01:29:14.035]  Now, you need to see those articles.
[01:29:14.055 --> 01:29:15.335]  You need to see those admissions.
[01:29:15.895 --> 01:29:17.596]  You need to have this information.
[01:29:18.116 --> 01:29:31.962]  Because if we don't, they're going to continue to carry out terror, and then ratchet up the level of control over and over again, and have all their anti-terror drills, which are really drills to merge local government under total federal control.
[01:29:32.263 --> 01:29:35.064]  They're setting up the dictatorship right now.
[01:29:35.845 --> 01:29:44.211]  The Dictatorship of the New World Order and its titular head, George W. Bush, the ultra-socialist neocon.
[01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:47.794]  So please take action.
[01:29:47.854 --> 01:29:49.715]  Get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:29:49.735 --> 01:29:51.656]  Get The Masters of Terror, the two films.
[01:29:51.717 --> 01:29:52.977]  Get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:29:52.997 --> 01:29:53.758]  Get The Takeover.
[01:29:53.818 --> 01:29:54.539]  Get Police State 2000.
[01:29:54.739 --> 01:29:57.681]  Want to find out what goes on at Bohemian Grove?
[01:29:58.777 --> 01:30:02.920]  The little neocon meeting group that I snuck into a few years ago?
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.122]  Get Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:09.885]  Make copies of the film.
[01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:13.627]  That's right, I authorize you, I beg you to make copies of the film.
[01:30:15.128 --> 01:30:17.770]  Get the videos to make the copies.
[01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.371]  Hundreds of copies.
[01:30:19.491 --> 01:30:24.475]  And I would add, if anything ever happens to me, I want you to make thousands of copies of those videos.
[01:30:25.115 --> 01:30:26.236]  Make copies of the films.
[01:30:26.923 --> 01:30:33.566]  Get them out to everyone, everywhere, so they can know the true horror of what we face inside the New World Order.
[01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:43.391]  Now, the films are $25.95 apiece, but if you order three or more of any of the eight films, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:49.174]  That's an $18 discount on the three-tape special, $24 discount on the four-tape special, and so on.
[01:30:49.254 --> 01:30:49.795]  Again, the book is $12.
[01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:52.210]  Call toll-free.
[01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:53.071]  Get the videos.
[01:30:53.091 --> 01:30:55.092]  Get the book now.
[01:30:55.112 --> 01:30:58.695]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:59.355 --> 01:31:11.164]  That's 888-253-3139 or infowars.com or net.
[01:31:11.645 --> 01:31:13.406]  Stand up for humanity.
[01:31:13.466 --> 01:31:20.031]  Fill your ingrained programming that God gave you to stand up against threats to your family of the most wicked type.
[01:31:20.686 --> 01:31:23.588]  The New World Order is endlessly, desperately wicked.
[01:31:24.829 --> 01:31:32.353]  If you don't have an instinctive need to expose them and warn others before their evil expands, then you're not really alive and something's wrong with you.
[01:31:32.693 --> 01:31:33.634]  Something's broken.
[01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:36.476]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:41.279 --> 01:31:49.564]  We have gotten in this position because people haven't been men, they haven't been women, they haven't stood up against corruption, they've decided it was somebody else's job.
[01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:53.002]  And that's the surest way for the Globals to eat your lunch.
[01:31:53.623 --> 01:31:56.864]  If you serve them, you're more likely to be stomped on by them.
[01:31:58.585 --> 01:32:01.926]  Again, that number, 1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or net.
[01:32:01.947 --> 01:32:06.529]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:32:18.135 --> 01:32:22.318]  That address is also posted on InfoWars.com or you can call the toll free number and get it.
[01:32:22.979 --> 01:32:25.881]  Alright, I got a bunch of other news coming up here that I want to get to.
[01:32:25.981 --> 01:32:27.562]  Passports will carry eye prints.
[01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:31.245]  Vermont cop photograph class projects.
[01:32:31.305 --> 01:32:36.590]  They now have political officers in the schools to decide if anything is hateful or anti-government.
[01:32:38.031 --> 01:32:43.875]  They'll also get into broad domestic role, ask for CIA and Pentagon.
[01:32:43.915 --> 01:32:45.517]  Oh, the CIA, really nice folks.
[01:32:45.537 --> 01:32:47.238]  Yeah, they'll keep you safe.
[01:32:48.869 --> 01:32:52.770]  War propels Exxon Robins to record 7 billion.
[01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.470]  BP's at record profits.
[01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:55.211]  Everybody is.
[01:32:55.611 --> 01:32:56.411]  That's okay, though.
[01:32:56.991 --> 01:32:57.831]  Oil isn't a motive.
[01:32:57.891 --> 01:32:58.652]  Oh, no, of course not.
[01:32:59.072 --> 01:33:00.392]  Weapon sales aren't a motive.
[01:33:01.472 --> 01:33:06.594]  High political approval ratings aren't a motive for the war.
[01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:10.054]  And certainly not a smoke screen for setting up a police state.
[01:33:10.234 --> 01:33:10.975]  No, no, no.
[01:33:12.135 --> 01:33:14.556]  Also, Bush fires warnings at U.S.
[01:33:14.616 --> 01:33:14.916]  enemies.
[01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:16.276]  You mean globalist enemies.
[01:33:17.808 --> 01:33:19.528]  Saying that other countries are next.
[01:33:19.768 --> 01:33:21.449]  So, they are going into other countries.
[01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.029]  There'll need to be a convenient terror attack.
[01:33:24.069 --> 01:33:25.189]  Blamed on someone, though.
[01:33:25.209 --> 01:33:25.729]  Don't worry.
[01:33:26.129 --> 01:33:28.990]  Much larger Gary Hart and other CFR people have told us.
[01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:30.510]  With total confidence.
[01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:35.331]  And then we'll call them prophets when Dallas or Denver or Cleveland get hit by smallpox.
[01:33:35.831 --> 01:33:41.292]  As Gary Hart said on national television on Hardball.
[01:33:42.092 --> 01:33:43.292]  Well, he said that before 9-1-1.
[01:33:43.312 --> 01:33:46.313]  He just said that on Addie and Combs.
[01:33:48.104 --> 01:33:53.009]  And also we're going to get into some of the other little interesting news stories here that I have.
[01:33:53.029 --> 01:33:56.973]  I already mentioned Neoconservative's push for a New World Order.
[01:33:57.033 --> 01:33:58.254]  That was out of Knight Ridder News Service.
[01:33:58.454 --> 01:33:59.315]  Oh, New World Order.
[01:34:00.036 --> 01:34:03.860]  Rumsfeld and Fortune Magazine with the nuclear reactors selling out our security.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:08.204]  The very folks taking our rights to keep us safe are the ones selling out our security.
[01:34:08.897 --> 01:34:10.479]  Autism Vaccine Link Considered.
[01:34:10.499 --> 01:34:11.439]  We're going to cover that.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:14.382]  State's Urge to Revise Smallpox Plans.
[01:34:14.862 --> 01:34:16.944]  Dublin Bomb Found Before Blair Visit.
[01:34:17.004 --> 01:34:18.185]  Probably M06 again.
[01:34:18.946 --> 01:34:19.206]  U.S.
[01:34:19.246 --> 01:34:21.268]  Shift Stance on North Korean Arms.
[01:34:21.969 --> 01:34:23.090]  Envoy Dubs U.S.
[01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:23.890]  a Police State.
[01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:24.811]  We'll hear about this.
[01:34:25.512 --> 01:34:26.933]  There's a lot of other news coming up.
[01:34:27.884 --> 01:34:30.405]  If you want America back, you've got to learn what the Bill of Rights is.
[01:34:30.445 --> 01:34:37.568]  And first and foremost, read your Bill of Rights, read your Declaration of Independence, and then ask yourself, is that what we have here in America today?
[01:34:37.608 --> 01:34:39.309]  And the answer is no, a 180.
[01:34:40.849 --> 01:34:42.190]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.831]  Let's talk to Andrew in North Carolina.
[01:34:44.991 --> 01:34:45.892]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[01:34:45.952 --> 01:34:46.292]  Welcome.
[01:34:47.352 --> 01:34:47.832]  Hi, Alex.
[01:34:47.872 --> 01:34:48.373]  How you doing?
[01:34:48.513 --> 01:34:48.913]  Good, sir.
[01:34:49.753 --> 01:34:51.694]  I had an idea.
[01:34:51.714 --> 01:34:53.455]  I don't know if you'd support me on it.
[01:34:54.727 --> 01:34:58.649]  The idea popped in my head a while back while I was tying down a load of glass.
[01:34:58.729 --> 01:35:10.033]  Anyway, the idea was how much of a coincidence that a little girl gets kidnapped in Utah and just so happens that her last name is Smart.
[01:35:11.554 --> 01:35:18.677]  In fact, there's a Smart chip out there and now her parents and Amber's parents have signed the Amber Alert Bill.
[01:35:19.869 --> 01:35:38.622]  Which turns over all radio, TV, billboards to FEMA and they're now flashing Report Terrorist, Report Guns and then it turns out that she's related to a congressman and all this other stuff and then there's some weird freak with her and yeah, the whole thing stinks to high heaven but I don't know sir, I don't speculate.
[01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:43.845]  And it turns out that, you know, there's a smart chip out there and they signed this bill and
[01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:45.420]  No, what's next?
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.842]  They're going to push for implanted microchips in kids now.
[01:35:48.863 --> 01:35:49.783]  Well, it's not next!
[01:35:49.803 --> 01:35:51.024]  They've been doing that for two years.
[01:35:53.226 --> 01:35:53.326]  Oh.
[01:35:53.366 --> 01:35:54.267]  Yeah, Sean Hannity.
[01:35:54.367 --> 01:35:55.728]  Every child needs a chip.
[01:35:55.748 --> 01:35:56.909]  What a great technology.
[01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:58.771]  I'm going to invest in the company.
[01:36:01.193 --> 01:36:03.254]  I just read a book by Robert Ludlum.
[01:36:03.294 --> 01:36:03.815]  You heard of him?
[01:36:04.375 --> 01:36:04.696]  Yes.
[01:36:04.716 --> 01:36:08.319]  The book was called The Prometheus Deception.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:10.761]  I didn't read it.
[01:36:10.781 --> 01:36:12.382]  I actually listened to it on audio tape.
[01:36:14.724 --> 01:36:15.545]  Recent history.
[01:36:16.505 --> 01:36:24.430]  Terror attacks, uh, new bill being signed for world protection, um, anthrax attacks, stuff like that.
[01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:33.096]  You know, just coming out like that and apparently... Well, did you know that the Pentagon pays $40 million a year to a Hollywood think tank to write scripts?
[01:36:34.697 --> 01:36:34.937]  Yeah.
[01:36:35.417 --> 01:36:39.320]  And that they wrote scripts about hijacked jet airliners flying to the World Trade Center?
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.481]  Yeah, I saw that episode.
[01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:43.810]  Oh yeah, it's been a lot of stuff.
[01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:44.950]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:52.775]  About the series, Seven Days, that was on UPN, where they had all these terrorist attacks that they'd go back in time and fix.
[01:36:53.835 --> 01:36:54.956]  All these different attacks.
[01:36:55.596 --> 01:37:08.183]  Well, they had the lone gunman on Fox, where the hijack- a secret government group hijacks a jet airliner to fly it into a World Trade Center to give Marshall Law, and then you read the Nightrunner News Service, and it says,
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:18.528]  Rupert Murdoch is behind the neocons in the Weekly Standard Magazine, and they've taken over the government, and they're running everything for the New World Order, and it says they were prophets.
[01:37:19.429 --> 01:37:23.032]  It says it makes the neocons look like prophets because they predicted it.
[01:37:23.072 --> 01:37:34.962]  Yeah, they were making TV shows, ha ha ha, where the secret government hijacks the jet airliner to fly it into the building with remote control systems to get martial law, and that came out three months before 9-1-1.
[01:37:35.102 --> 01:37:36.023]  Thanks for the call.
[01:37:36.863 --> 01:37:42.464]  And then we find out, I have AP articles on InfoWars.com and the giant archive of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:44.065 --> 01:37:47.905]  It turns out that, uh, that's right folks!
[01:37:48.466 --> 01:38:03.569]  AP and others reported the CIA just so happened to be running a drill with the top envoy from the White House and the National Security Council of flying hijacked jet airliners into city landmarks in DC and New York.
[01:38:05.124 --> 01:38:14.207]  On the morning of 9-1-1, at 830 to 930 in the morning, at that exact time, just accidentally.
[01:38:14.247 --> 01:38:17.428]  And that's why NORAD was told to stand down.
[01:38:18.188 --> 01:38:23.349]  That's what they're now telling the troops at NORAD and the head of Homeland Security and the rest of it, where it's all based.
[01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:26.490]  This is ridiculous, folks.
[01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:28.090]  Totally ridiculous.
[01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:30.291]  People are nuts, too.
[01:38:31.511 --> 01:38:33.392]  Why else would they have the Chicago Mercantile
[01:38:34.264 --> 01:38:38.866]  Exchange on 9-1-1, the one-year anniversary come up 9-1-1.000000.
[01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:45.428]  Saw the article that said 9-1-1.0.
[01:38:45.448 --> 01:38:48.690]  I went and looked up on the Chicago Mercantile at the close of that day.
[01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:51.451]  The zeros went on basically forever.
[01:38:52.611 --> 01:38:53.531]  That's never happened.
[01:38:53.571 --> 01:38:54.712]  That's impossible.
[01:38:55.882 --> 01:38:57.223]  Oh, you're thinking that was just a fluke.
[01:38:57.383 --> 01:39:02.205]  Oh, it came up 9-1-1 at the New York Lottery on 9-1-1, one-year anniversary.
[01:39:02.605 --> 01:39:03.546]  Just their little mark.
[01:39:03.606 --> 01:39:10.329]  Hey, we control the lotteries, we control the exchanges, the speculation exchanges, down to the point they close it.
[01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:13.551]  It's just la-la land, folks.
[01:39:14.231 --> 01:39:16.212]  And it's their little sick joke amongst themselves.
[01:39:16.512 --> 01:39:17.372]  Ha-ha-ha.
[01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:20.894]  The insider trading leads right back to the CIA.
[01:39:21.034 --> 01:39:22.675]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[01:39:24.286 --> 01:39:30.569]  And you know, it's not like the globalists are doing all this corrupt stuff to quote, back in the fifties they said, we're doing all these bad things so we can defeat the communist men.
[01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:32.589]  That's why we're working with all these former Nazis.
[01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:33.530]  You follow their orders.
[01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:35.471]  You know, we gotta, the commies are bad.
[01:39:35.531 --> 01:39:36.911]  We gotta be even tougher to defeat them.
[01:39:36.931 --> 01:39:38.092]  We gotta be more evil than the enemy.
[01:39:39.632 --> 01:39:44.214]  Well, you know, then that gave way to, hey, we're just corrupt gangsters and we enjoy what we're doing and we want it all.
[01:39:44.234 --> 01:39:44.874]  We want it now.
[01:39:48.936 --> 01:39:51.097]  But now, it's just, uh, it's just crazy.
[01:39:52.955 --> 01:39:56.797]  The globalists are in trouble though, because folks, there are thousands of talk shows, talking like I'm talking.
[01:39:57.758 --> 01:40:00.700]  There's tens of thousands of websites, people everywhere.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.681]  We're the majority.
[01:40:01.801 --> 01:40:04.743]  I've done 800 plus radio interviews now.
[01:40:04.983 --> 01:40:05.163]  Over 800.
[01:40:05.223 --> 01:40:11.687]  And there have been maybe 100 people that called in to disagree, 5,000 plus that called in to agree.
[01:40:11.707 --> 01:40:13.928]  90 plus percent agree.
[01:40:13.968 --> 01:40:16.410]  I mean, one call out of 30 disagrees with what I'm saying.
[01:40:18.869 --> 01:40:23.370]  Alright, let's go ahead and uh... talk to uh... we just talked to Andrews.
[01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:26.671]  I guess next is Tom in Maryland, then Larry in Louisiana, then Charles in Pennsylvania.
[01:40:27.051 --> 01:40:28.371]  Tom in Maryland, you're on the air.
[01:40:28.391 --> 01:40:30.271]  Alright, hold on.
[01:40:31.071 --> 01:40:31.852]  Put him off for a second.
[01:40:32.272 --> 01:40:32.652]  Put him off.
[01:40:33.692 --> 01:40:36.132]  I need everybody to always turn their radios off.
[01:40:37.053 --> 01:40:38.953]  Very important thing I ask everybody to do.
[01:40:40.093 --> 01:40:41.734]  Is uh... Tom's radio off?
[01:40:42.014 --> 01:40:42.414]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:42.774 --> 01:40:44.054]  Okay, what's on your mind, sir?
[01:40:44.934 --> 01:40:48.475]  Um, just wanted to let you know I'm anxiously anticipating your uh...
[01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:50.242]  A few of your films.
[01:40:50.722 --> 01:40:53.785]  I've been listening for many years and never bought them.
[01:40:54.086 --> 01:40:58.369]  I figured you were preaching to the converted, but I calmed and bought them anyhow.
[01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:03.794]  And I had a conversation a few weeks ago with somebody.
[01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:11.882]  It's so interesting the way people, and this was an individual who's never voted in his life and is not registered to vote.
[01:41:13.264 --> 01:41:27.713]  And since the War Wagon is running at full steam, I was telling this guy, look, Bush helped put Saddam Hussein in power, George Bush Sr.
[01:41:27.733 --> 01:41:34.597]  did, and Al-Qaeda and Iraq do have a connection, it's called the CIA.
[01:41:34.617 --> 01:41:40.140]  I was basically shouted down, I'm called unpatriotic and all these things, but what amazes me is
[01:41:41.962 --> 01:41:53.888]  A lot of the population's willingness to just jump on a bandwagon when they don't even participate in the electoral process, never have, never had an interest in politics at all.
[01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:57.990]  No, they know nothing, they are nothing, they're just grueling idiots.
[01:41:58.451 --> 01:42:04.014]  It's an admitted historical fact that he was a CI hitman in 58, that Bush Sr.
[01:42:04.034 --> 01:42:07.596]  was CI director in the late 70s.
[01:42:09.243 --> 01:42:19.965]  Uh... when uh... and and and and mid-seventies whenever he broke it when Saddam got into power it's admitted he was told to attack Iran that April Gillespie told him to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:42:20.285 --> 01:42:22.065]  That's on the record, but you talk to these people.
[01:42:22.105 --> 01:42:23.706]  Look, I had a guy call the TV show last week.
[01:42:23.726 --> 01:42:24.626]  I talked about this yesterday.
[01:42:25.446 --> 01:42:28.186]  And he said, Austin doesn't take people's houses.
[01:42:28.226 --> 01:42:28.746]  That's not true.
[01:42:28.766 --> 01:42:30.467]  And I said, sir, it's on TV.
[01:42:30.847 --> 01:42:31.707]  They seize houses.
[01:42:31.727 --> 01:42:32.747]  You don't pay your property tax.
[01:42:33.087 --> 01:42:33.847]  No, you're a liar.
[01:42:34.767 --> 01:42:36.528]  And there's no way the government could do anything wrong.
[01:42:36.588 --> 01:42:38.108]  I mean, they don't need any facts.
[01:42:38.715 --> 01:42:40.597]  They just need to feel good.
[01:42:41.117 --> 01:42:41.698]  Exactly.
[01:42:42.138 --> 01:42:48.003]  Yes, and the conversation I had, I was basically being yelled at and told.
[01:42:48.023 --> 01:42:54.990]  I tried to tell this guy, you know, because it went in so many different directions at one time.
[01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:58.433]  I was telling him, you know, your income tax monies go to the I.M.S.
[01:42:58.513 --> 01:42:59.454]  and Federal Reserve.
[01:43:00.354 --> 01:43:03.476]  So on and so forth, and no, no they don't, no they don't!
[01:43:03.576 --> 01:43:09.879]  You know, it's just a loud, vehement denial makes it true, and uh... Now wait a minute, though.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:18.424]  If he didn't have some problems subconsciously, the subconscious is much more powerful, you know, it's more powerful processor God gave us.
[01:43:18.584 --> 01:43:21.426]  It knows the truth, whereas the conscious doesn't.
[01:43:21.886 --> 01:43:29.470]  This guy, if he'd laugh at you if it wasn't serious, you know, if he thinks they protest too much, why do they get so excited then?
[01:43:30.226 --> 01:43:30.786]  Exactly.
[01:43:31.407 --> 01:43:38.830]  And since this whole war thing has gone on, I have met a few people who are against it.
[01:43:38.850 --> 01:43:42.552]  What if you tell him that private lynch rescue was a phony deal?
[01:43:42.572 --> 01:43:43.672]  He'll go, you liar!
[01:43:44.913 --> 01:43:47.214]  That same type of guy will say,
[01:43:47.873 --> 01:43:51.196]  You'll go, well, you know, all these bio and chemical finds have turned out to be fake.
[01:43:51.336 --> 01:43:52.057]  That's not true!
[01:43:52.177 --> 01:43:52.657]  Shut up!
[01:43:52.717 --> 01:43:54.378]  You go, well, here's the retraction in the newspaper.
[01:43:54.519 --> 01:43:55.379]  That's liberal!
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:56.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.602]  I don't know, Bush is going after our guns.
[01:43:59.122 --> 01:44:08.450]  Look, hold on, I'll hold you over if we need to, Todd, but I've been on conservative talk shows and I've had them call in and say, you're a lying liberal.
[01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:10.051]  Bush ain't going to register my guns.
[01:44:10.512 --> 01:44:11.993]  He ain't going to reinstate Clinton.
[01:44:12.193 --> 01:44:13.074]  I go, sir, yes he is.
[01:44:13.965 --> 01:44:15.927]  And the hosts will say, well, actually, Mr. Jones is correct.
[01:44:15.947 --> 01:44:17.548]  They'll go, well, fine, man!
[01:44:17.568 --> 01:44:18.809]  Right.
[01:44:19.009 --> 01:44:26.694]  Before you need some... I mean, it's like their brain is flip-flopping moment to moment so they don't have any responsibility.
[01:44:26.875 --> 01:44:27.275]  Go ahead.
[01:44:27.935 --> 01:44:29.657]  Yes, one last quick thing.
[01:44:29.677 --> 01:44:30.477]  You don't have to hold me over.
[01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:32.919]  I know you have a lot of callers.
[01:44:33.199 --> 01:44:35.801]  I wanted to lay a quote on you from this guy.
[01:44:37.817 --> 01:44:43.262]  I believe in too many conspiracy theories and you just gotta watch the news and believe it.
[01:44:43.502 --> 01:44:44.303]  That's what he told me.
[01:44:44.523 --> 01:44:46.205]  And he's a successful businessman.
[01:44:46.405 --> 01:44:46.885]  That's right.
[01:44:46.965 --> 01:44:47.866]  I'm successful.
[01:44:47.986 --> 01:44:48.587]  I'm important.
[01:44:48.627 --> 01:44:50.388]  I'm part of this power system.
[01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:53.812]  You just need to watch the news and believe it.
[01:44:54.492 --> 01:44:55.753]  And be part of it.
[01:44:56.434 --> 01:44:58.175]  I'm reporting you.
[01:44:58.235 --> 01:44:59.817]  You're with Al Qaeda.
[01:44:59.997 --> 01:45:01.078]  It's Nazi Germany.
[01:45:01.138 --> 01:45:01.879]  Nazi Germany.
[01:45:04.964 --> 01:45:12.329]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.

[01:45:28.199 --> 01:45:35.364]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:45:35.384 --> 01:45:36.164]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:45:36.204 --> 01:45:39.927]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:45:40.087 --> 01:45:42.608]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:45:42.829 --> 01:45:49.533]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:17.852]  Well, the caller in Maryland, Tom, that's the response I've seen.
[01:48:17.933 --> 01:48:22.475]  It's, boy, you better never come around these parts.
[01:48:22.555 --> 01:48:25.217]  Well, sir, I'm trying to keep your Second Amendment shut up, commie.
[01:48:25.237 --> 01:48:30.540]  I mean, I've had them actually say, they will say on air, it's a certain type.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.220]  It's a good old boy.
[01:48:32.068 --> 01:48:35.912]  He'll call in, he means well, but he's so sappy he can't get over his emotion.
[01:48:36.553 --> 01:48:40.417]  And he'll say, stop showing Bush's for gun control, because I always bring that out, it's a great example.
[01:48:40.957 --> 01:48:42.179]  You know, the guy's worse than Clinton.
[01:48:42.919 --> 01:48:46.423]  Not because he's George Bush, it's because we're just further along in the New World Order.
[01:48:46.443 --> 01:48:48.545]  It doesn't matter who was in there now, they're just puppets.
[01:48:48.565 --> 01:48:52.209]  But the point is, I've got to get past that for them and show them that he's just a puppet.
[01:48:53.132 --> 01:49:00.039]  So I'm explaining that he's gun-grabbing, and they'll say, you're a liar, and the host is usually up to speed and goes, well, actually, he is supporting more gun control.
[01:49:00.639 --> 01:49:03.202]  Well, uh, fine, man, we need to support it.
[01:49:03.242 --> 01:49:05.564]  You know, they'll have an instant flip-flop.
[01:49:07.005 --> 01:49:16.234]  And Tom mentions this guy who says, and I've heard this, hey, I got a good job, I'm doing good, I'm successful, I like the government, I'm with the government, and you better shut up.
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:18.982]  Mike Hanson does some camera work for me.
[01:49:19.022 --> 01:49:21.325]  He got some video that I just finally saw this week.
[01:49:21.365 --> 01:49:22.166]  He's had it for a month.
[01:49:22.586 --> 01:49:25.310]  They were having the pro-war Bush rallies downtown in Austin.
[01:49:25.330 --> 01:49:27.152]  They had like 30 people there.
[01:49:28.353 --> 01:49:29.194]  Mike walks up.
[01:49:29.294 --> 01:49:29.955]  I wasn't there.
[01:49:29.975 --> 01:49:33.799]  I was with one other person and says, hey, why are you for the war?
[01:49:33.899 --> 01:49:37.744]  And the guy just screams, Mike Hanson, you're with Alex Jones!
[01:49:38.801 --> 01:49:46.648]  I will bleep bleep your hind end if you don't say you're for George Bush and started threatening to assault Mike.
[01:49:46.688 --> 01:49:47.489]  This is on tape!
[01:49:47.549 --> 01:49:48.990]  And Mike goes, hey, you're on camera!
[01:49:50.512 --> 01:49:53.354]  And he goes, and Mike goes, wait a minute, so what do you think of George Bush?
[01:49:53.474 --> 01:49:54.615]  I'll die for him!
[01:49:54.776 --> 01:49:55.957]  I love him!
[01:49:55.997 --> 01:50:04.024]  I was like a Iraqi, just screaming they love the leader because the media said so, and you know, they're mindless slaves of the media and the neocons are controlling them.
[01:50:04.867 --> 01:50:08.329]  I mean, the Chris Matthews and the Rush Limbaughs are together just worshipping Bush.
[01:50:08.769 --> 01:50:11.450]  This is the final phase of the New World Order takeover of America.
[01:50:11.991 --> 01:50:16.653]  They had this phony left-wing bias, now it's shifting into just a worship of Bush, the neocon.
[01:50:18.134 --> 01:50:24.337]  And so, of course, Tom has a neighbor who's, well, I'm a successful businessman, you need to just watch the news and believe it.
[01:50:24.857 --> 01:50:25.878]  I've seen those people.
[01:50:27.111 --> 01:50:28.172]  You just need to know.
[01:50:28.192 --> 01:50:30.053]  Well, you're from the troops, aren't you?
[01:50:30.073 --> 01:50:32.135]  Well, uh, yeah, but we're being lied to.
[01:50:32.655 --> 01:50:33.335]  Shut up!
[01:50:34.356 --> 01:50:36.718]  I never knew you were with Al-Qaeda!
[01:50:36.758 --> 01:50:40.060]  Well, actually, the government works with Al-Qaeda and is in business with them.
[01:50:40.761 --> 01:50:41.781]  I have the documents here.
[01:50:42.042 --> 01:50:43.042]  I don't want to see that!
[01:50:43.723 --> 01:50:44.724]  I don't want to see none of it!
[01:50:45.264 --> 01:50:49.447]  I have a Christian friend who's a pro-lifer who's been arrested like five times, spent months in jail.
[01:50:50.848 --> 01:50:51.629]  Bush is in office.
[01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:53.229]  He said, I'll take microchips.
[01:50:53.630 --> 01:50:54.670]  He said, so what?
[01:50:55.130 --> 01:50:57.232]  And he said, I'll accept world government.
[01:50:57.432 --> 01:50:58.292]  I love Bush.
[01:50:58.332 --> 01:51:00.313]  I mean, it is like a cult following.
[01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:03.615]  But they're the minority, and a lot of those guys are finally waking up.
[01:51:05.176 --> 01:51:06.417]  It's just, it's sick!
[01:51:07.598 --> 01:51:08.098]  It's sick.
[01:51:08.258 --> 01:51:09.699]  It was all elaborately set up.
[01:51:10.379 --> 01:51:13.721]  Let's go ahead and talk to Larry Louisiana than Charles.
[01:51:14.321 --> 01:51:15.222]  Larry, you're on the air.
[01:51:15.262 --> 01:51:15.662]  Go ahead.
[01:51:16.062 --> 01:51:16.723]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:16.743 --> 01:51:17.163]  Good day.
[01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:18.231]  How you doing?
[01:51:18.331 --> 01:51:21.772]  Did you hear Jeanette Hanson this morning on the Peacock Channel?
[01:51:21.993 --> 01:51:26.494]  Well, they call it the Peacock Channel, but if you strip his wings off, sure looks like an oblique view of a horned owl to me.
[01:51:27.735 --> 01:51:31.716]  France is going, all biometric identification.
[01:51:31.736 --> 01:51:35.597]  And then she says, biometric identification?
[01:51:35.757 --> 01:51:37.098]  What is that?
[01:51:37.178 --> 01:51:39.919]  That sounds awful futuristic to me.
[01:51:39.939 --> 01:51:42.760]  She, to her commentator, mentions, can they do that?
[01:51:43.539 --> 01:51:44.140]  Well, yes, Jeanette.
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:45.461]  Oh, this is so neat!
[01:51:45.501 --> 01:51:47.923]  They'll have to thumb scan to buy and sell.
[01:51:48.924 --> 01:51:50.245]  How does that happen?
[01:51:51.366 --> 01:51:52.207]  Yes, Jeanette.
[01:51:52.307 --> 01:51:55.530]  Actually, these systems are all completely already built.
[01:51:55.891 --> 01:51:58.213]  And they have total amenity and keep you safe.
[01:51:58.333 --> 01:51:59.394]  I've seen the script.
[01:51:59.414 --> 01:51:59.654]  Yeah.
[01:52:00.175 --> 01:52:04.239]  We figure it'll take about five years to get all the systems in place.
[01:52:04.819 --> 01:52:06.640]  Oh, they said they're going to do it here.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.121]  Oh.
[01:52:07.541 --> 01:52:09.622]  Well, see, France is a bad cop right now.
[01:52:09.642 --> 01:52:17.108]  They completely convoluted the story by completely eliminating that story in the same breath and said, well, those French people don't understand why we're mad at them.
[01:52:17.368 --> 01:52:18.469]  Are they getting over that?
[01:52:18.529 --> 01:52:20.050]  See, they just convoluted the story.
[01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:22.011]  Yeah, well, we'll be having that.
[01:52:22.251 --> 01:52:28.315]  Well, now the big banking associations are announcing, have a bank account, not just if you go catch a check now, but buy and sell.
[01:52:28.836 --> 01:52:30.617]  And they're going to tax the daylights out of you.
[01:52:30.657 --> 01:52:32.598]  Hope you enjoy it.
[01:52:33.719 --> 01:52:34.399]  Anything else?
[01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:43.743]  Yeah, I met an E-8 that just came back from Korea, and they have received the briefing on getting the chip, and he signed... Oh, yeah, stay there.
[01:52:43.763 --> 01:52:46.324]  Yeah, yeah, my cousin was in, two weeks ago, was in my living room.
[01:52:46.684 --> 01:52:48.844]  They've been told they're all getting the microchip.
[01:52:49.125 --> 01:52:52.166]  It's all part of Sweden, fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:52:54.412 --> 01:52:58.035]  Grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers without chemicals with the help of Arbico.
[01:52:58.255 --> 01:53:00.777]  Eating healthy and preserving our Earth has never been this easy.
[01:53:00.877 --> 01:53:05.161]  Go to Arbico.com today and you'll learn, like I did, about the beneficial organisms.
[01:53:08.884 --> 01:53:12.066]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.657 --> 01:53:20.297]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.958 --> 01:53:22.018]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.738 --> 01:53:23.839]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.479 --> 01:53:25.299]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.059 --> 01:53:26.980]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:31.461]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.821 --> 01:53:35.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.423 --> 01:53:41.665]  Uh, yoo-hoo!
[01:53:43.065 --> 01:53:47.587]  When you've got a government with a president that lands on an aircraft carrier in a military suit,
[01:53:49.005 --> 01:53:49.986]  That's not a good sign.
[01:53:50.026 --> 01:53:59.511]  When face scanning cameras and armored vehicles are everywhere, and police in black uniforms and ski masks, and they tell you they're going to register your guns and that it's conservative, you're in deep trouble.
[01:53:59.551 --> 01:54:00.331]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:54:00.611 --> 01:54:01.071]  We are!
[01:54:01.372 --> 01:54:07.775]  And my cousin, two Mondays ago, was sitting in my living room, been in the army for 20 years.
[01:54:07.815 --> 01:54:08.515]  She's an officer.
[01:54:09.316 --> 01:54:10.677]  They were given a briefing this year.
[01:54:10.697 --> 01:54:12.277]  They're all getting microchips.
[01:54:13.778 --> 01:54:15.019]  The entire armed services.
[01:54:16.548 --> 01:54:25.517]  And then it goes into the general public, and they're telling them, brace for more terror, we'll have to give up all our rights, the Army's going to run our lives, but the border will stay wide open.
[01:54:26.318 --> 01:54:34.145]  And Larry in Louisiana was saying, he just talked to an E-8 that got back from North Korea, he said, they're all getting their chips, got the same briefing.
[01:54:34.766 --> 01:54:36.728]  You know, that's Twilight Zone, folks.
[01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:39.872]  You're not patriotic if you're against it.
[01:54:39.892 --> 01:54:41.273]  Let me tell you what the tactic is going to be.
[01:54:41.813 --> 01:54:47.418]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and claim that anti-chipping, anti-biometric groups are doing it.
[01:54:47.959 --> 01:54:49.320]  And so if you're anti-chip,
[01:54:50.309 --> 01:54:56.532]  Yes, I see it exactly.
[01:54:56.672 --> 01:54:59.853]  And the E-8 stated that he's just got five months to retire.
[01:55:00.194 --> 01:55:02.394]  He hopes he gets out before they get him all chipped.
[01:55:02.414 --> 01:55:03.615]  He don't want to take his chip.
[01:55:03.995 --> 01:55:04.936]  And then I asked him...
[01:55:10.882 --> 01:55:11.843]  It's now been in print.
[01:55:12.223 --> 01:55:13.604]  Everybody I talked to was against it.
[01:55:13.644 --> 01:55:14.645]  How about you say no?
[01:55:15.165 --> 01:55:20.869]  Well, I informed him, Alex, that even though they said that he doesn't have constitutional rights, he really does have his God-given constitutional rights.
[01:55:20.889 --> 01:55:23.030]  Well, look, I mean, did they tell you to take cyanide?
[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:24.211]  Did they tell you to take a dangerous...
[01:55:24.941 --> 01:55:29.587]  Look, the smallpox shot, it says, do not give it to a breastfeeding a pregnant woman.
[01:55:29.848 --> 01:55:34.313]  They just court-martialed a woman in Michigan because she was breastfeeding and wouldn't take a smallpox shot.
[01:55:35.335 --> 01:55:38.239]  I mean, the bottle says don't take it!
[01:55:38.559 --> 01:55:40.682]  They're breaking the law when they do that!
[01:55:40.962 --> 01:55:42.323]  Well, see, he knows it.
[01:55:42.563 --> 01:55:44.065]  And then I asked him about the survey.
[01:55:44.125 --> 01:55:45.746]  I said, they call us civilians, you know.
[01:55:46.046 --> 01:55:49.369]  But that survey came around that asked you if you would fire on U.S.
[01:55:49.409 --> 01:55:52.011]  civilians in time of national emergency here.
[01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:56.074]  And he quietly, in a lower voice, said, I put no on that.
[01:55:56.455 --> 01:56:02.359]  And then I asked him, I said, since you just got back from Korea, do you know who built that reactor in North Korea?
[01:56:02.519 --> 01:56:04.021]  And he raised his right hand.
[01:56:04.341 --> 01:56:05.562]  So he knew some stuff, Alex.
[01:56:07.509 --> 01:56:08.790]  Why did he raise his right hand?
[01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:09.431]  We did.
[01:56:10.331 --> 01:56:11.993]  We built the reactor in North Korea.
[01:56:12.393 --> 01:56:13.955]  Yeah!
[01:56:14.975 --> 01:56:15.836]  Isn't it sick?
[01:56:15.876 --> 01:56:18.859]  I mean, you couldn't come up with a book this crazy.
[01:56:18.879 --> 01:56:19.740]  People wouldn't believe it.
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:21.441]  Well, those are the truths.
[01:56:21.501 --> 01:56:29.528]  And I told him, I said, while you're in there, if it ever comes down here, when the war comes right here, we're counting on people like you who do know some of these things, to back us up.
[01:56:29.548 --> 01:56:30.969]  Well, you notice he's been overseas.
[01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:35.153]  When you're like my cousin or this guy and you say on the survey, I won't fire on Americans,
[01:56:35.902 --> 01:56:36.983]  You get sent overseas.
[01:56:37.103 --> 01:56:38.583]  You get sent overseas.
[01:56:38.623 --> 01:56:42.265]  He said there's 36,000 troops in South Korea.
[01:56:42.385 --> 01:56:44.706]  He said it's the biggest set up you've ever seen.
[01:56:44.726 --> 01:56:46.367]  80% of those are only support troops.
[01:56:46.847 --> 01:56:48.648]  The other 20% are combat.
[01:56:48.968 --> 01:56:49.869]  That's the biggest set up.
[01:56:49.889 --> 01:56:51.049]  So look for a set up there.
[01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:54.251]  And they're plotting a dysfunctional mental ill.
[01:56:54.271 --> 01:56:55.272]  The guy's mental ill, isn't he?
[01:56:55.652 --> 01:56:59.834]  The guy has Hollywood stars, Asian film stars, kidnapped for his quote, pleasure palace.
[01:56:59.894 --> 01:57:02.155]  I mean this guy is Baron Harkonnen in the flesh.
[01:57:02.735 --> 01:57:04.736]  Kim Jong-il running around foaming at the mouth.
[01:57:04.776 --> 01:57:06.476]  The globals are threatening to nuke him every day.
[01:57:06.776 --> 01:57:08.597]  Rumsfeld's paper gets leaked.
[01:57:08.677 --> 01:57:09.817]  Yeah, on purpose.
[01:57:10.317 --> 01:57:12.278]  Saying we're going to invade them in October.
[01:57:12.738 --> 01:57:15.019]  They're just trying to get this guy to sneak attack us.
[01:57:15.479 --> 01:57:16.039]  Exactly.
[01:57:16.079 --> 01:57:20.160]  That's your next big setup right there to get the American population behind the war.
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:21.721]  Well, I mean he's got at least 100 nukes.
[01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:24.902]  And probably 10 warheads that can hit us.
[01:57:24.922 --> 01:57:28.303]  Can you imagine a Taipan Dong 3 hitting the western coast?
[01:57:28.683 --> 01:57:30.883]  Well, one landed in Alaska, didn't it?
[01:57:31.283 --> 01:57:32.444]  Yeah, they did a test shot.
[01:57:32.484 --> 01:57:33.524]  Our government kept it quiet.
[01:57:34.044 --> 01:57:34.284]  Shh!
[01:57:34.344 --> 01:57:36.945]  If we tell them that, people will say, invade them, not Iraq.
[01:57:37.005 --> 01:57:37.665]  That comes later.
[01:57:38.245 --> 01:57:38.605]  Shh!
[01:57:39.005 --> 01:57:39.146]  Yeah.
[01:57:39.586 --> 01:57:40.026]  Okay, Alex.
[01:57:40.046 --> 01:57:41.546]  Have a good day.
[01:57:41.566 --> 01:57:41.926]  Keep it up.
[01:57:41.946 --> 01:57:43.707]  Yeah, that was a dummy test missile.
[01:57:45.207 --> 01:57:45.587]  Oh, man.
[01:57:45.627 --> 01:57:47.028]  I tell you, we're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[01:57:47.108 --> 01:57:48.168]  I mean, I'm sitting here.
[01:57:49.428 --> 01:57:50.289]  We're on the edge.
[01:57:50.309 --> 01:57:51.549]  We've got to defend America.
[01:57:53.377 --> 01:58:01.526]  It's not like we got some good ol' boys running things that just like to all shucks be corrupt and get a little extra money on the side.
[01:58:01.946 --> 01:58:05.330]  You're talking about scientifically crafted focused evil.
[01:58:06.371 --> 01:58:10.536]  You're talking about control freaks right out of the bowels of Hades.
[01:58:11.116 --> 01:58:12.098]  What do they call Pearl?
[01:58:12.358 --> 01:58:13.219]  The Prince of Darkness?
[01:58:15.129 --> 01:58:18.151]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:58:18.472 --> 01:58:23.415]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:58:23.656 --> 01:58:28.019]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:58:28.299 --> 01:58:37.226]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:58:37.426 --> 01:58:41.049]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:58:41.329 --> 01:58:46.378]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:46.658 --> 01:58:53.410]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:54.431]  What about you?
[01:58:55.171 --> 01:59:00.535]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:59:21.907 --> 01:59:23.267]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:59:23.467 --> 01:59:25.668]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:59:25.828 --> 01:59:27.928]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:33.130]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:37.491]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:59:37.751 --> 01:59:39.532]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:59:39.612 --> 01:59:50.261]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.401 --> 01:59:52.302]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:59:52.522 --> 01:59:56.345]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:00:18.238 --> 02:00:19.079]  Listen up, folks.
[02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:22.600]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[02:00:23.001 --> 02:00:28.383]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[02:00:28.723 --> 02:00:33.386]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[02:00:34.586 --> 02:00:40.851]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take Sea Silver.
[02:00:41.292 --> 02:00:50.119]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in an organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[02:00:50.419 --> 02:00:53.642]  And what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.
[02:00:54.042 --> 02:00:56.004]  Try delicious tasting Sea Silver today.
[02:00:56.424 --> 02:00:58.946]  You'll feel a difference in two weeks, or your money back.

[02:01:11.236 --> 02:01:20.202]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.542 --> 02:01:22.844]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:32.621 --> 02:01:35.043]  All right, folks, I'm fired up about freedom.
[02:01:35.303 --> 02:01:36.444]  I love this country.
[02:01:37.524 --> 02:01:41.447]  And all we can do is tell the truth and get involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:01:43.148 --> 02:01:44.208]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:01:44.268 --> 02:01:48.731]  Let's talk to Charlie in Pennsylvania and Stuart, Tim, Fred, and others.
[02:01:49.432 --> 02:01:50.092]  Go ahead, Charlie.
[02:01:50.112 --> 02:01:50.692]  You're on the air.
[02:01:51.453 --> 02:01:52.273]  Yes, Alex.
[02:01:53.434 --> 02:01:59.738]  MacArthur said that the history of defeat and war could be summed up in two words, too late.
[02:02:00.717 --> 02:02:09.299]  And he had seven criteria for that, but I can only remember two, and one of them was not understanding your enemy's evil intentions.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:18.522]  When you're talking about these people, and I believe this David Ickes is really right, that these people are reptiles in human form.
[02:02:19.482 --> 02:02:26.264]  That might be on a figurative plane, but we're dealing with some demons here, and without God, forget it.
[02:02:27.604 --> 02:02:29.305]  He also said that you must
[02:02:31.593 --> 02:02:39.177]  Incorporate all possible allies to go against any kind of war.
[02:02:40.318 --> 02:02:48.603]  And what scares me about what these guys are talking about the military is that what they're doing is they're driving good people out of the military.
[02:02:49.611 --> 02:02:57.814]  And the more they do this, they're blatantly doing things like they're doing with that girl up there who's pregnant, and what they're doing, saying we're going to give you the chip, and we're going to give you all these narcotics.
[02:02:58.114 --> 02:03:07.957]  They're blatantly doing that because I believe that they want rid of these people who actually know something, and they want to bring other people in.
[02:03:08.997 --> 02:03:13.699]  Well, you've already talked about that they're going to bring in some of these illegal aliens.
[02:03:14.315 --> 02:03:16.076]  No, it's a great point.
[02:03:16.116 --> 02:03:19.539]  It's a great litmus test that, oh, well, you're pregnant.
[02:03:19.579 --> 02:03:22.901]  It says don't give the smallpox shot to a woman who's breastfeeding.
[02:03:22.921 --> 02:03:24.322]  We're going to court-martial you.
[02:03:24.923 --> 02:03:27.684]  Or, oh, we're going to put chips in all of you in briefings.
[02:03:28.125 --> 02:03:29.786]  It's meant to get, it was like Bill Clinton.
[02:03:29.826 --> 02:03:34.409]  His job was to get good people out of the military and get the mindless goons in.
[02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:40.994]  And now the Washington Times reported last year they're not just going to hire felons, but illegal aliens.
[02:03:41.789 --> 02:03:48.655]  Who are felons, aggravated felons, the Washington Times said, are now joining the military in droves.
[02:03:49.195 --> 02:03:50.476]  So it's just like Stalin.
[02:03:50.716 --> 02:03:53.999]  You open the prison doors and out come the thugs.
[02:03:54.039 --> 02:03:56.281]  Yeah, they're getting their army together, aren't they?
[02:03:56.461 --> 02:04:01.966]  And they can easily control these people and get them to do what they want because they have no sense of
[02:04:03.082 --> 02:04:04.964]  I guess values, if that's what you want to call it.
[02:04:04.984 --> 02:04:09.947]  Yeah, anybody who would take the smallpox shot when they're breastfeeding, when it says not to do it, it is nuts.
[02:04:10.047 --> 02:04:12.929]  And so they want a woman who will do that to be in the army.
[02:04:12.989 --> 02:04:15.311]  They want someone who will take a microchip.
[02:04:16.352 --> 02:04:17.512]  I mean, I am some weird one.
[02:04:17.532 --> 02:04:19.714]  You know, you could see special forces getting one.
[02:04:20.395 --> 02:04:24.337]  But no, the entire troops, all for their identification.
[02:04:24.858 --> 02:04:26.779]  No, no, this is setting the precedent.
[02:04:26.799 --> 02:04:27.880]  It's like the smallpox shot.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.303]  First the troops, then the police, the doctors, then the general public.
[02:04:33.286 --> 02:04:34.166]  It's like this with everything.
[02:04:34.186 --> 02:04:36.047]  They test it out in the military.
[02:04:37.547 --> 02:04:49.389]  Well, actually what I called you about was this KGB thing, and I know I'm beating this to death, but have you ever heard of a guy named Oleg Kalugin?
[02:04:49.989 --> 02:04:51.990]  He's supposed to be a commentator.
[02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:55.911]  He was a former KGB counterintelligence chief.
[02:04:56.411 --> 02:04:57.211]  I have, yes.
[02:04:57.471 --> 02:04:58.951]  Does he work for Fox News?
[02:04:59.031 --> 02:05:01.352]  It says here that he's a commentator for Fox News.
[02:05:01.412 --> 02:05:02.132]  Is that possible?
[02:05:02.799 --> 02:05:04.560]  Well, I believe that's the guy I've seen on TV.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:05.420]  That's where I've heard of him.
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:13.262]  I don't particularly pay much attention to the talking heads, but, uh... Well, anyway... Oh, and we've now got the former KGB chief helping, quote, set up the internal passport.
[02:05:13.542 --> 02:05:15.683]  That's right, the KGB's good!
[02:05:16.323 --> 02:05:22.124]  Well, they're claiming on this thing that I got, it's some woman named, uh... Charlotte, uh, Iserbyte.
[02:05:22.844 --> 02:05:23.205]  Iserbyte.
[02:05:23.925 --> 02:05:24.305]  Is that it?
[02:05:24.945 --> 02:05:25.205]  Okay.
[02:05:25.265 --> 02:05:32.107]  And, well, she's claiming that they tried to, um, discredit this Al Martin, whoever this guy is, National Liberty Press.
[02:05:32.597 --> 02:05:40.120]  And they give him all this disinformation, but it's so stupid because they're saying, yeah, they did hire these people, but they didn't hire them for Homeland Defense.
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:44.701]  Poindexter actually hired them for this organization he has.
[02:05:45.082 --> 02:05:47.763]  Oh, Total Information Awareness.
[02:05:47.943 --> 02:05:48.723]  Yeah.
[02:05:48.803 --> 02:05:59.607]  No, the article that was later in the Associated Press, he was hired to set up the internal passports for Total Information Awareness by the convicted felon, Admiral Poindexter.
[02:06:01.451 --> 02:06:02.753]  And that is Homeland Security.
[02:06:03.153 --> 02:06:06.016]  You know, people say, well what's the difference between Patriot Act and Homeland Security?
[02:06:06.377 --> 02:06:07.558]  Patriot Act's a law.
[02:06:07.918 --> 02:06:09.700]  Homeland Security is the takeover.
[02:06:10.041 --> 02:06:15.807]  Total Information Awareness is the national ID card data encryption tracking mode.
[02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:21.554]  So because you haven't specifically mentioned Admiral Poindexter and this thing that he's
[02:06:22.014 --> 02:06:24.255]  That you're a nut, then, about these KGB?
[02:06:24.395 --> 02:06:35.019]  I mean, obviously, they hired- Well, the DARPA office, the DARPA office is charged with surveilling and coming up with the technologies to control the hover drones, the biometrics in the grocery stores.
[02:06:35.359 --> 02:06:38.940]  It was DARPA in 68 that called for thumb scanning to buy and sell.
[02:06:39.761 --> 02:06:40.761]  This is the brainchild.
[02:06:40.801 --> 02:06:41.622]  These are the bosses.
[02:06:42.342 --> 02:06:46.783]  Well, this, uh, this guy that I'm, uh, asking you about- Yes, it is Homeland Security.
[02:06:46.803 --> 02:06:48.264]  It's an office of Homeland Security.
[02:06:48.644 --> 02:06:50.705]  Well, this, this collagen who, um,
[02:06:51.425 --> 02:06:53.026]  I mentioned it works for Fox News.
[02:07:09.449 --> 02:07:13.031]  Um, KGB generals, this guy fully believes in the system.
[02:07:13.071 --> 02:07:17.574]  I have his book here, written in 94, and they have him working for Fox News.
[02:07:17.654 --> 02:07:21.416]  I mean... Yeah, and he's been on, and that's the guy, remember, saying the war is great and it's all wonderful.
[02:07:21.436 --> 02:07:22.056]  Yeah, of course.
[02:07:23.077 --> 02:07:23.637]  Oh, man.
[02:07:23.657 --> 02:07:24.377]  Thanks for the call.
[02:07:24.397 --> 02:07:24.638]  Sure.
[02:07:24.938 --> 02:07:25.778]  Appreciate it.
[02:07:25.918 --> 02:07:27.339]  Oh, yes, it's all crazy.
[02:07:27.899 --> 02:07:29.340]  And it's driving me nuts, folks.
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.502]  I mean, you know, I just can't believe how crazy things have gotten.
[02:07:33.362 --> 02:07:34.183]  It's out of control.
[02:07:34.263 --> 02:07:36.064]  Stewart, in New York.
[02:07:36.284 --> 02:07:37.145]  Stewart, you're on the air.
[02:07:37.165 --> 02:07:37.585]  Go ahead.
[02:07:37.905 --> 02:07:38.626]  Good afternoon.
[02:07:38.706 --> 02:07:41.148]  I've got some potentially good news for you.
[02:07:41.168 --> 02:07:45.011]  It seems that your influence reaches all the way to Florida, at least.
[02:07:45.931 --> 02:07:57.780]  A friend of mine just got back from the NRA convention, and the buzz amongst the people there was that if Bush does support the continuation of the lying
[02:08:01.144 --> 02:08:02.965]  Gun ban and magazine ban.
[02:08:03.485 --> 02:08:07.267]  He will not receive the support from the NRA in the next election.
[02:08:07.567 --> 02:08:10.349]  And that's happening because you put pressure on the NRA.
[02:08:10.369 --> 02:08:10.949]  Good job.
[02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.429]  Right.
[02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.290]  That and also the Lady of Peace.
[02:08:14.111 --> 02:08:16.112]  I know you were saying that the NRA was ignoring that.
[02:08:16.532 --> 02:08:17.173]  Not anymore.
[02:08:17.193 --> 02:08:19.814]  And this is, again, thanks to folks like yourself.
[02:08:20.652 --> 02:08:21.513]  Uh, the word is out.
[02:08:21.773 --> 02:08:24.474]  Well, I gotta say thanks to listeners who called the NRA.
[02:08:24.515 --> 02:08:26.956]  I mean, just a month ago, the NRA was saying, oh yes, we're for it.
[02:08:27.256 --> 02:08:28.477]  You're saying now they're against it.
[02:08:28.797 --> 02:08:31.539]  Uh, from what my friend said, he went to the convention.
[02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:35.061]  He's an endowment member of the NRA, so he's pretty high up on the ranks.
[02:08:35.361 --> 02:08:36.982]  I'll tell you what they do to the mid-level ranks.
[02:08:37.002 --> 02:08:42.866]  They'll say, oh yeah, we're doing something, and then wink, wink, still give the campaign money and run the scam.
[02:08:43.447 --> 02:08:49.191]  Well, that remains to be seen, but at least... At least they're having to say it's bad, yeah.
[02:08:49.451 --> 02:08:59.298]  At least they're admitting now that the announcement a year ago of redoing the assault weapons ban, the announcement a year ago of this new ban, at least they're admitting it exists now.
[02:08:59.638 --> 02:08:59.899]  Yes.
[02:09:00.339 --> 02:09:05.122]  And the thing is, Bush cannot be re-elected without the support of the NRA.
[02:09:05.142 --> 02:09:07.324]  If it wasn't for us, he would not have won.
[02:09:10.192 --> 02:09:11.575]  The IRS is full of good people.
[02:09:11.635 --> 02:09:13.097]  The problem is the leadership.
[02:09:13.117 --> 02:09:15.421]  Remember when they supported that CARA bill?
[02:09:15.461 --> 02:09:17.685]  The $47 billion land grab?
[02:09:18.733 --> 02:09:20.474]  What a monstrosity that was.
[02:09:20.534 --> 02:09:22.734]  I nearly terminated my membership over that.
[02:09:23.075 --> 02:09:23.975]  Well, I mean, that's my point.
[02:09:24.015 --> 02:09:29.577]  I'm somebody who five years ago had an NRA sticker on their car, so it's not like I'm... This was painful for me to admit all this.
[02:09:29.957 --> 02:09:30.977]  I was a Republican!
[02:09:31.318 --> 02:09:33.378]  I've given money to the Republican Party, folks.
[02:09:33.838 --> 02:09:35.819]  And I'm not gonna let them sell my country out.
[02:09:35.859 --> 02:09:37.860]  It just is not gonna happen.
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:42.221]  What do you think of all these neocon turncoat talk show hosts that won't tell the truth?
[02:09:42.601 --> 02:09:46.743]  Well, the good news is, at least this organization seems to be coming around.
[02:09:47.136 --> 02:09:55.722]  No, you had Larry Pratt on a couple of weeks ago, and the sentiment that he expressed, I think, is finally taking solid root in the NRA.
[02:09:56.083 --> 02:09:56.783]  There is hope.
[02:09:58.124 --> 02:09:58.624]  That's good.
[02:09:58.664 --> 02:10:00.146]  I'll leave you with that.
[02:10:00.226 --> 02:10:03.748]  I've said this, we need to have a peaceful coup at the NRA.
[02:10:03.808 --> 02:10:07.411]  We need to have the board members to be removed.
[02:10:07.631 --> 02:10:08.992]  There's two or three that are conservative.
[02:10:09.012 --> 02:10:10.033]  What is it, a nine-member board?
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:11.761]  I don't recall, sir.
[02:10:11.981 --> 02:10:13.882]  Well, I've read about it, but I can't remember right now.
[02:10:13.902 --> 02:10:14.703]  My memory's failing me.
[02:10:15.163 --> 02:10:17.485]  But we need to have the NRA taken over.
[02:10:17.785 --> 02:10:20.948]  We could save America with that 5 million member group.
[02:10:21.068 --> 02:10:24.610]  Imagine if they really went forward and really stood up.
[02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:28.193]  Well, if you consider the fact that Bush only won, ha ha.
[02:10:28.997 --> 02:10:34.760]  With a couple of thousand votes, if five million of us all of a sudden disappear from his side, he's toast.
[02:10:35.181 --> 02:10:36.481]  Well, I gotta tell you, I appreciate the call.
[02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:43.305]  If Al Gore, Stewart, would have won the election, we'd be in better shape right now, because we know he's evil.
[02:10:43.746 --> 02:10:45.407]  We know he's anti-gun.
[02:10:45.467 --> 02:10:47.067]  We know he's anti-Christian.
[02:10:47.468 --> 02:10:49.109]  We know he's anti-America.
[02:10:49.509 --> 02:10:53.051]  Can you imagine Al Gore trying to pass a Patriot Act, even if there was a terrorist attack?
[02:10:53.638 --> 02:10:56.219]  Can you imagine Al Gore trying to have our borders wide open?
[02:10:56.239 --> 02:10:57.419]  Can you imagine Al Gore?
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:05.483]  He would never get away with trying to reinstate the assault weapons ban because Republicans would have the House and Senate and they'd have to vote against him.
[02:11:07.303 --> 02:11:10.184]  They would never get away with any of this.
[02:11:11.665 --> 02:11:12.905]  It would energize.
[02:11:13.766 --> 02:11:19.328]  But no, no, no, no, we have the neocon calling for the quote, here's the Knight Ridder News Service,
[02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:21.450]  I've read her newspapers.
[02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:24.251]  Neo-conservatives push for one world government.
[02:11:24.631 --> 02:11:26.232]  De-conservatives push for a new world order.
[02:11:27.093 --> 02:11:27.913]  And it goes into it.
[02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:29.654]  Oh, they're such prophets!
[02:11:29.694 --> 02:11:33.096]  They predicted the attack on the World Trade Center!
[02:11:33.556 --> 02:11:35.357]  How did they do it?
[02:11:35.937 --> 02:11:36.097]  Oh!
[02:11:36.858 --> 02:11:41.720]  I'll get Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror, my book, to sit in the tyranny and you'll find out!
[02:11:44.201 --> 02:11:47.343]  You will find out, ladies and gentlemen, the reality
[02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:56.672]  Total free number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[02:11:56.692 --> 02:11:57.212]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:11:57.292 --> 02:12:01.033]  Tim and Fred and others, your calls are up next when we get back.
[02:12:01.053 --> 02:12:01.693]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:05.874]  Did a good job in the first hour covering a lot of news.
[02:12:05.914 --> 02:12:07.654]  Did a moderate job in the last hour.
[02:12:08.134 --> 02:12:09.775]  Haven't really covered any news yet this hour.
[02:12:10.635 --> 02:12:15.896]  I'm going to cover news we haven't gotten to and then recap some stuff real quick when we get back.
[02:12:15.956 --> 02:12:18.236]  Then the calls and back into more calls and back into more news.
[02:12:18.988 --> 02:12:20.888]  So, stay with us for the balance of the broadcast.
[02:12:20.908 --> 02:12:24.389]  We have about 20 minutes left in this show.
[02:12:25.009 --> 02:12:28.830]  Remember, this show airs Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:29.870]  until 2 p.m.
[02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:35.071]  Central Standard Time and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:12:35.111 --> 02:12:40.912]  The daytime show simulcast on Global Shortwave at 12.172 and 93.20 and at night from 9 to midnight Central at 5.085 and 68.90.
[02:12:49.304 --> 02:12:54.626]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net.
[02:12:55.106 --> 02:12:59.868]  And InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com have been redesigned and radically expanded.
[02:13:00.488 --> 02:13:03.449]  Definitely demand your perusal daily.
[02:13:04.509 --> 02:13:08.951]  I'm Alex Jones and I've got Mark riding shotgun with me.
[02:13:09.951 --> 02:13:11.712]  Your calls, we're all riding shotgun.
[02:13:11.732 --> 02:13:12.712]  Stay with me, we'll be right back.
[02:13:16.323 --> 02:13:18.524]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:13:18.964 --> 02:13:23.327]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:13:23.587 --> 02:13:29.390]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:33.672]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:13:33.973 --> 02:13:39.616]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:13:39.736 --> 02:13:42.337]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:13:44.438 --> 02:13:48.341]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:13:48.381 --> 02:13:50.762]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:13:51.103 --> 02:13:53.404]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:13:53.784 --> 02:13:57.407]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:13:57.887 --> 02:14:04.091]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:14:04.531 --> 02:14:05.532]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:14:05.852 --> 02:14:06.192]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:06.212 --> 02:14:06.393]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:15.575 --> 02:14:17.536]  A good healthy heart is serious business.
[02:14:18.096 --> 02:14:22.337]  It's well known that heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in America today.
[02:14:22.737 --> 02:14:25.798]  A cause that in a lot of cases could have been prevented.
[02:14:26.298 --> 02:14:31.900]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to help improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:41.723]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite drops and capsules may increase metabolism and heart muscle tissue, regulate heart rhythm, and improve oxygen and blood flow to the heart.
[02:14:42.313 --> 02:14:44.015]  Your healthy heart is up to you.
[02:14:44.475 --> 02:14:47.178]  The first step to a healthy heart starts with Cardivite.
[02:14:47.674 --> 02:14:48.595]  Call toll-free 877-817-9829.
[02:14:48.615 --> 02:14:48.915]  That's 877-817-9829.

[02:15:14.887 --> 02:15:16.488]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:15:16.868 --> 02:15:22.592]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:15:22.852 --> 02:15:27.975]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:15:28.335 --> 02:15:35.500]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes,
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:35.580]  Yes!
[02:15:52.569 --> 02:15:58.533]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:15:58.834 --> 02:16:05.038]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:16:06.159 --> 02:16:07.340]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:16:14.716 --> 02:16:16.497]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:16:16.677 --> 02:16:22.318]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:16:22.658 --> 02:16:23.498]  Probably never, right?
[02:16:23.778 --> 02:16:26.839]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[02:16:27.119 --> 02:16:29.540]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:36.962]  For the past 55 years, the Cal Bend Soap Company has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:16:37.182 --> 02:16:40.965]  Now for the first time, CalBen Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:16:41.266 --> 02:16:44.248]  CalBen Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:16:44.528 --> 02:16:45.950]  It's earth friendly and it's safe.
[02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:48.932]  Call the CalBen Soap Company today toll free at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:16:48.992 --> 02:16:49.192]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:17:04.025 --> 02:17:10.489]  That web address again is CalbinPureSoap.com.
[02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:13.612]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:17:23.819 --> 02:17:25.000]  Yes, I'm a maniac.
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:26.101]  Yes, I love freedom.
[02:17:26.802 --> 02:17:28.082]  Thanks for putting up with me, folks.
[02:17:30.518 --> 02:17:33.039]  People tune in to this show, though, because they know it's for real.
[02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:34.260]  I mean what I say.
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.081]  I do what I say.
[02:17:36.101 --> 02:17:38.682]  I don't compromise, and I know what I'm talking about.
[02:17:38.722 --> 02:17:39.823]  My track record shows that.
[02:17:40.383 --> 02:17:43.825]  Paying cash triggers alert for terrorism in the new world.
[02:17:44.986 --> 02:17:47.067]  This is out of the Virginia of Highlet.
[02:17:47.127 --> 02:17:48.548]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:17:48.948 --> 02:17:52.950]  Usually, if you hear somebody say, your money's no good here, pal, it's a nice thing.
[02:17:53.510 --> 02:17:54.171]  It means the
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:18:02.486]  Barkeeper is buying you a drink, or some friend or business associate has decided to pick up the dinner tab.
[02:18:03.186 --> 02:18:06.009]  Journalists seldom hear that phrase, and they speak it even less.
[02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:17.759]  Barkeeps know that we're always broke, and if you want to see a clutch of newspaper reporters disappear into a vapor, just toss a dinner check onto their table.
[02:18:18.119 --> 02:18:20.261]  It's like waving a cross in front of Dracula.
[02:18:21.403 --> 02:18:28.526]  But a polite equivalent of your money's no good here arrived in the mail the other day in the form of a note from the sax department store.
[02:18:29.187 --> 02:18:45.194]  Folks, the only reason we have an account with them is that my wife once said she wanted to get some sax, and I hardly agreed, only to learn that, as a mutant Midwesterner, I'd once again misinterpreted her South Virginia accent.
[02:18:46.494 --> 02:18:48.115]  Those women in Virginia do have pretty voices.
[02:18:48.855 --> 02:18:49.976]  Fine Southern ladies.
[02:18:51.610 --> 02:18:59.898]  Anyway, the note from Sachs said that henceforth it would not accept cash as a form of payment on store accounts in any form over $350.
[02:19:00.959 --> 02:19:09.728]  Checks and money orders, online payments and such are fine, it said, but no bills or change totaling more than $350 in any one month billing cycle.
[02:19:10.268 --> 02:19:13.071]  No federal government regulation, Sachs said, made this necessary.
[02:19:13.855 --> 02:19:20.999]  That aroused our curiosity as to no other company with which we do credit business that advised us of any such policy.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:29.764]  Also, as far as we could tell, the currency that the government prints still says on it is known as legal tender for all debts, public and private.
[02:19:31.425 --> 02:19:34.527]  And he says a call to the hotline number at SACS provided
[02:19:35.265 --> 02:19:43.992]  Results in one of those long, oily recorded messages in which the guy pretty much repeated the sex already said in the note that came in the mail.
[02:19:45.413 --> 02:20:03.708]  And by the end of it, he found out that under a little discussed element of the USA Patriot Act, any business that accepts cash in amounts of $2,000 or more from a customer must file a suspicious activities report with the Treasury Department if the business suspects that the customer might have been involved in some illegal activity.
[02:20:04.671 --> 02:20:05.352]  It goes on.
[02:20:06.052 --> 02:20:07.693]  And that has nothing to do with fighting terror.
[02:20:07.713 --> 02:20:09.615]  It's all about crime, crime, crime.
[02:20:09.655 --> 02:20:10.756]  So that's the new America.
[02:20:12.197 --> 02:20:13.798]  Again, I already mentioned this, but it's important.
[02:20:13.858 --> 02:20:16.020]  CNN reports Bechtel tied to Bin Laden's.
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.622]  The company getting some of the big contracts in Iraq.
[02:20:18.662 --> 02:20:19.282]  Rebuilding.
[02:20:20.163 --> 02:20:22.845]  Working with the Bin Ladens, as usual.
[02:20:23.505 --> 02:20:30.671]  And they got Rumsfeld in Fortune Magazine tied to the transfer of nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[02:20:30.711 --> 02:20:33.193]  He was on the board, as usual, the bag man.
[02:20:34.205 --> 02:20:37.067]  Autism Vaccine Link Considered, UPI.
[02:20:37.968 --> 02:20:49.616]  An epidemic of autism and other brain problems in American children is linked to vaccines, say doctors, activists, and one member of Congress who met in Chicago over the weekend to discuss the disease.
[02:20:50.996 --> 02:21:02.004]  At a three-day meeting at Loyola University, researchers said growing evidence indicates that the vaccines are linked to increased rates of brain problems, that the government health agencies have done little to recognize it, autism,
[02:21:03.071 --> 02:21:08.972]  One, a non-profit group dedicated to learning from and more about autism sponsored the meeting.
[02:21:09.892 --> 02:21:12.853]  There are some bureaucrats in these agencies who have really dropped the ball.
[02:21:12.873 --> 02:21:15.773]  They're not dropped the ball, they all used to work for the vaccine mayors.
[02:21:16.493 --> 02:21:25.435]  The ball and are doing things that are malicious and may be criminal to Dr. Boyd Haley, Chairman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago.
[02:21:25.455 --> 02:21:27.635]  Boy, that is big.
[02:21:28.635 --> 02:21:31.936]  You got the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago head, you gotta put it on them.
[02:21:32.657 --> 02:21:37.160]  Boy believes a mercury-based preservative added to the vaccines during the 90s may have caused the autism.
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:37.721]  Uh-uh.
[02:21:38.281 --> 02:21:39.322]  That's the cover story.
[02:21:39.422 --> 02:21:46.567]  It's the hormone designed in a brain development hormone to attack cerebral cortex development.
[02:21:47.027 --> 02:21:48.809]  Most of you just get an IQ reduction.
[02:21:50.130 --> 02:21:55.393]  People that have compromised immune systems get severely retarded or autistic.
[02:21:55.954 --> 02:21:57.695]  Little gift from your government.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:04.224]  Boyd believes a mercury-based preservative added to vaccines during the 90s may be the cause of autism.
[02:22:04.704 --> 02:22:09.788]  He said the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have failed to address the issue.
[02:22:10.348 --> 02:22:13.770]  Autism rates have increased ten times since the late 90s, since the 80s.
[02:22:14.231 --> 02:22:17.553]  The CDC says that 1 in 300 American children may suffer from autism.
[02:22:18.033 --> 02:22:21.516]  And there are thousands of reports, major medical journals, even done studies now.
[02:22:22.036 --> 02:22:23.337]  They give the kids shots.
[02:22:25.171 --> 02:22:28.913]  And when they're like, you know, 2 months, 6 months, 18 months, there's different points you get them.
[02:22:28.993 --> 02:22:34.515]  And the kid will be fine, giggling, mama, dada, drooling in the corner 10 hours after injection point.
[02:22:36.396 --> 02:22:37.617]  Now that's disgusting.
[02:22:38.497 --> 02:22:40.658]  And I got a report here in Mesa, Arizona.
[02:22:40.798 --> 02:22:41.979]  Nice middle class family.
[02:22:42.339 --> 02:22:43.420]  Goes in, newborn baby.
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:45.180]  They go, we want to give them a hepatitis shot.
[02:22:45.921 --> 02:22:46.801]  They say, no way!
[02:22:47.101 --> 02:22:48.362]  That's one of the most dangerous shots.
[02:22:48.402 --> 02:22:49.022]  It is, by the way.
[02:22:49.122 --> 02:22:49.783]  Smart family.
[02:22:50.943 --> 02:22:51.783]  And you know what?
[02:22:51.944 --> 02:22:52.724]  There's no law
[02:22:53.450 --> 02:22:55.831]  They're threatening to take the kid, got him surrounded by police.
[02:22:57.132 --> 02:22:59.573]  I mean, they don't even have laws in their doing.
[02:23:01.473 --> 02:23:01.974]  Imagine.
[02:23:02.294 --> 02:23:03.134]  This is incredible.
[02:23:03.154 --> 02:23:03.814]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:05.915 --> 02:23:06.896]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.316 --> 02:23:08.916]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.837 --> 02:23:12.538]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:17.353 --> 02:23:20.998]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:23:21.138 --> 02:23:25.523]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:23:25.743 --> 02:23:26.264]  The Aeronizer.
[02:23:26.284 --> 02:23:26.304]  803-4438.
[02:23:26.384 --> 02:23:27.305]  That's toll free, 808-803-4438.
[02:23:27.525 --> 02:23:28.386]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:43.283]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:43.783 --> 02:23:46.507]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:02.447 --> 02:24:05.048]  All right, let's go back to your calls.
[02:24:05.368 --> 02:24:07.968]  And I know I was ranting and raving in the last segment.
[02:24:08.088 --> 02:24:10.269]  I mean, you now got top scientists.
[02:24:10.289 --> 02:24:11.269]  They've been saying it for years.
[02:24:11.329 --> 02:24:13.209]  These vaccines are ravaging our children.
[02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:20.831]  And I see cases every day in the news around the country where they take people's children because parents refuse to vaccinate them.
[02:24:21.311 --> 02:24:22.331]  There's no law.
[02:24:24.952 --> 02:24:26.152]  There's no law.
[02:24:27.272 --> 02:24:28.453]  They just do it.
[02:24:28.633 --> 02:24:30.153]  And I've got an article right here today about it.
[02:24:31.047 --> 02:24:32.167]  That's the crazy thing now.
[02:24:32.207 --> 02:24:34.388]  The government's starting to do stuff where there's not even a law.
[02:24:34.408 --> 02:24:40.649]  I mean, you talk about nuts, but what they do is they corner you and get you to sign documents.
[02:24:41.089 --> 02:24:42.430]  I've got to air that newscast.
[02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:47.831]  I've aired it probably ten times on my little cable TV show here in Austin.
[02:24:48.231 --> 02:24:49.491]  We're on CBS.
[02:24:50.772 --> 02:24:59.894]  Well, we've done a report a couple years ago about how, and I never said this on the air, but we actually caused the report to be on CBS television.
[02:25:00.583 --> 02:25:10.034]  Uh, because we did the report about how when you get arrested for parking tickets, uh, anything, any petty, any bad thing, it doesn't matter.
[02:25:11.215 --> 02:25:11.636]  Anything.
[02:25:11.656 --> 02:25:13.818]  You get arrested now for not wearing a seatbelt here in Austin.
[02:25:13.838 --> 02:25:15.440]  You've seen the big national case with that.
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:16.501]  I mean, they arrest people every day.
[02:25:17.002 --> 02:25:19.745]  You jaywalk, you get arrested, they arrest you for anything in this town.
[02:25:20.205 --> 02:25:21.527]  It's even worse in Williamson County.
[02:25:22.797 --> 02:25:23.557]  North of Austin.
[02:25:23.877 --> 02:25:29.319]  And they said on the news, you are now guilty until proven innocent in Travis County.
[02:25:29.419 --> 02:25:34.301]  And when you get arrested, they come to the door and they say, we'll let you go, just sign here.
[02:25:34.381 --> 02:25:35.341]  It's a release form.
[02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:37.301]  They don't even tell you what it is.
[02:25:37.461 --> 02:25:42.563]  And most people are so trusting that government wouldn't do something wrong, they're signing.
[02:25:42.743 --> 02:25:44.504]  And we found three different forms.
[02:25:46.184 --> 02:25:47.985]  One has eight crimes on the back.
[02:25:48.325 --> 02:25:52.186]  Family violence, drug abuse, drug dealing, drunk driving,
[02:25:53.494 --> 02:25:54.855]  A whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:25:54.915 --> 02:25:56.556]  You agree to all these classes.
[02:25:57.356 --> 02:26:03.379]  Anger management, drug abuse classes, you agree, affirmed a judification that you've committed all these crimes.
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:07.242]  And now you're in the database as being adjudicated a criminal.
[02:26:07.882 --> 02:26:09.643]  Now, folks, I mean, this has been on the news.
[02:26:10.103 --> 02:26:15.746]  Women who were arrested for unpaid tickets go in.
[02:26:15.806 --> 02:26:17.127]  Women are particularly trusting.
[02:26:17.147 --> 02:26:18.187]  They're not stupid.
[02:26:18.207 --> 02:26:19.968]  I'm not saying women are dumb.
[02:26:20.028 --> 02:26:21.029]  They're trusting.
[02:26:23.004 --> 02:26:24.145]  You know, trust the snake.
[02:26:24.745 --> 02:26:25.286]  This happens.
[02:26:25.366 --> 02:26:26.247]  But men do it too.
[02:26:26.327 --> 02:26:29.609]  But women particularly do this.
[02:26:30.250 --> 02:26:31.271]  Especially with their kids.
[02:26:31.291 --> 02:26:32.592]  They're just trusting in government.
[02:26:34.873 --> 02:26:36.815]  And they go in and they're rushing for anything.
[02:26:36.835 --> 02:26:37.636]  They just say, sign here.
[02:26:37.656 --> 02:26:38.476]  And they go, oh sure.
[02:26:38.957 --> 02:26:39.957]  Thank you, jail guard.
[02:26:40.538 --> 02:26:41.479]  And then they go, okay.
[02:26:41.499 --> 02:26:45.181]  And then they get their letters in the mail for thousands of dollars of classes.
[02:26:47.563 --> 02:26:50.085]  So government's learned how to just build the parameters.
[02:26:50.766 --> 02:26:52.027]  Set things up where
[02:26:53.382 --> 02:26:54.763]  They just say this is the way it is.
[02:26:55.223 --> 02:26:56.584]  There's not even a discussion.
[02:26:56.985 --> 02:26:59.226]  Thumb scanners are here for you to get your driver's license.
[02:26:59.727 --> 02:27:01.048]  There's no law, but you have to do it.
[02:27:02.108 --> 02:27:04.110]  They're the same thing as going to the grocery store.
[02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:08.173]  It's just set up for you, like a corral for a domesticated animal.
[02:27:08.193 --> 02:27:10.315]  Just, oh, there's no law, just sign here.
[02:27:11.275 --> 02:27:13.157]  We're not going to let you call or see a lawyer or leave.
[02:27:13.557 --> 02:27:14.398]  Just sign this.
[02:27:14.718 --> 02:27:18.961]  And it's been on the news that if you argue with them, we did a big news piece on this.
[02:27:18.981 --> 02:27:21.563]  We did this news piece four years ago, actually.
[02:27:23.052 --> 02:27:24.933]  Every show we've done just keeps re-airing.
[02:27:24.973 --> 02:27:32.858]  We just turn them back in, the live shows we do, and a local news lady, investigator, saw it and called Mike off the comment line and they made a piece about it.
[02:27:33.098 --> 02:27:39.982]  We appreciate that, but... The point is, is that, yes, you're guilty until proven innocent where I live.
[02:27:41.103 --> 02:27:42.483]  And they don't even hide this fact.
[02:27:42.503 --> 02:27:43.404]  They're very proud of it.
[02:27:43.444 --> 02:27:44.264]  The newscast aired.
[02:27:44.305 --> 02:27:44.945]  Nothing's been done.
[02:27:46.517 --> 02:27:48.738]  Maybe a few people now say no to it.
[02:27:49.298 --> 02:27:50.878]  And I know I've been bringing that up a lot lately.
[02:27:50.958 --> 02:27:52.939]  I just started realizing how nuts that is.
[02:27:54.339 --> 02:27:57.680]  For them to announce you're guilty until proven innocent, this is the new way it is.
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:27:58.860]  Just accept it.
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:05.202]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to the calls for all those that have been patiently holding.
[02:28:06.222 --> 02:28:10.403]  While I've been ranting and raving.
[02:28:12.304 --> 02:28:13.344]  Who is up next, Mark?
[02:28:15.017 --> 02:28:16.297]  Fred in Arizona.
[02:28:17.998 --> 02:28:18.838]  Tim in Texas.
[02:28:18.938 --> 02:28:19.599]  Tim in Texas.
[02:28:19.619 --> 02:28:20.039]  Go ahead.
[02:28:20.999 --> 02:28:21.519]  Hi, Alex.
[02:28:22.019 --> 02:28:22.580]  How you doing?
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:23.100]  How you doing?
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:23.440]  Fine.
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:30.422]  I wanted to say, uh, last fall, in October, November, I gave your 9-11 tape to Bob Broaddus.
[02:28:30.482 --> 02:28:33.523]  He's a de facto sheriff up in, uh, Aspen.
[02:28:34.183 --> 02:28:37.444]  And it woke up everyone in his department, even the undersheriff.
[02:28:37.965 --> 02:28:40.946]  They watched the videotape, and I gave them my original copy.
[02:28:41.166 --> 02:28:42.226]  I spent 30 bucks, and
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:46.361]  And I walked in the original copy... Well you know why Freak Shop Cops so bad?
[02:28:46.421 --> 02:28:49.201]  Because everything in that video they've already heard and seen.
[02:28:49.441 --> 02:28:50.602]  They know it's all true.
[02:28:50.922 --> 02:28:54.603]  And that's why people that are involved in it freak out when they see it.
[02:28:54.643 --> 02:28:55.903]  What happened with this show?
[02:28:56.043 --> 02:28:57.623]  It rocked his world, Alex.
[02:28:57.703 --> 02:29:01.784]  And everybody in that department up in Aspen, they woke him up.
[02:29:03.745 --> 02:29:05.825]  And I'm glad that I walked the tape in.
[02:29:05.945 --> 02:29:07.506]  And I gave him an original copy.
[02:29:07.526 --> 02:29:09.106]  I didn't give him no copy copies.
[02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:15.893]  Well, we have found that the color cover of the higher quality original, people do tend to watch it more if it's an original.
[02:29:16.173 --> 02:29:19.775]  But you know, still copies are great.
[02:29:20.055 --> 02:29:21.216]  Copies are waking folks up.
[02:29:21.236 --> 02:29:25.918]  But imagine if every sheriff got a copy, about half of them would wake up.
[02:29:26.238 --> 02:29:27.379]  Yep, and that's what we want.
[02:29:27.399 --> 02:29:34.402]  Because later on when this crap goes down, this bad stuff goes down, we need these people on our side.
[02:29:35.163 --> 02:29:35.783]  Well, we do.
[02:29:35.903 --> 02:29:37.224]  I mean, I have nothing against police.
[02:29:40.074 --> 02:29:45.037]  And standing against the New World Order and the deception, the lies, and the fraud.
[02:29:46.338 --> 02:29:47.579]  I heartily agree with you.
[02:29:48.499 --> 02:29:49.400]  What you did was assault.
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:51.401]  Is this Aspen, Texas, or Aspen, Colorado?
[02:29:51.601 --> 02:29:53.323]  It's Aspen, the Republic of Texas.
[02:29:53.363 --> 02:29:56.304]  They call it Colorado, but it still belongs to the Republic of Texas.
[02:29:56.344 --> 02:29:58.626]  No, I understand, but... It's a Northwest Territory.
[02:29:58.766 --> 02:30:00.027]  So where is this in Texas?
[02:30:00.871 --> 02:30:03.772]  This is up in the Rocky Mountains.
[02:30:04.152 --> 02:30:04.892]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[02:30:04.952 --> 02:30:07.373]  Is this in Texas, or is this in Colorado?
[02:30:07.673 --> 02:30:10.774]  Well, they call it Colorado, but... I understand, sir, but... It belongs.
[02:30:11.014 --> 02:30:11.314]  Okay.
[02:30:11.835 --> 02:30:12.675]  Okay, Alex?
[02:30:13.055 --> 02:30:13.655]  No, okay.
[02:30:13.915 --> 02:30:17.196]  I know, I think you called about this earlier, a few days ago.
[02:30:17.276 --> 02:30:25.079]  But listen, what I'm trying to say to you is, when you talk to the sheriff in Colorado, in Ashburn, what did they say after they watched it?
[02:30:27.128 --> 02:30:33.052]  I never got to go back in and talk to him, but I talked to other people, and I said it rocked his world.
[02:30:33.952 --> 02:30:34.953]  And it woke him up.
[02:30:35.333 --> 02:30:35.694]  Good!
[02:30:36.074 --> 02:30:43.159]  And he's not allowing the feds to come into his area.
[02:30:43.419 --> 02:30:45.400]  Wait a minute, I saw a news article about that.
[02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:48.722]  You're telling me that was caused by you giving him a copy of the video?
[02:30:49.663 --> 02:30:49.863]  Yep.
[02:30:50.263 --> 02:30:52.465]  That's right, I saw a news article about that, Sheriff.
[02:30:53.289 --> 02:30:54.410]  Wow, I've got to get him on.
[02:30:54.430 --> 02:30:56.331]  Hey, thanks for joining us and keep it up, bud.
[02:30:56.371 --> 02:30:57.832]  I appreciate you getting the original film.
[02:30:58.312 --> 02:30:59.213]  That does support us.
[02:31:00.134 --> 02:31:04.496]  And I guess when the video is $25.95 and $4 shipping and handling, I guess that is $30.
[02:31:04.796 --> 02:31:06.257]  But you know what?
[02:31:06.297 --> 02:31:07.278]  We need your support here.
[02:31:07.298 --> 02:31:08.699]  I never really talk about this.
[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:10.700]  I have a staff.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:12.121]  I've had to hire more employees.
[02:31:12.401 --> 02:31:14.343]  And I say make copies of my videos.
[02:31:15.003 --> 02:31:16.364]  I don't sell as many videos.
[02:31:18.311 --> 02:31:22.013]  If you would just get the videos and make copies, we could save the country.
[02:31:22.073 --> 02:31:24.455]  But buy the originals from me to make copies.
[02:31:24.515 --> 02:31:25.215]  At least do that.
[02:31:25.235 --> 02:31:27.117]  I know most of you never bought the videos from me.
[02:31:27.477 --> 02:31:30.539]  Your neighbor gave you a copy or sold you a copy, which they really shouldn't do.
[02:31:30.579 --> 02:31:32.340]  But hey, it's the information out.
[02:31:33.328 --> 02:31:35.949]  Get the video, make copies, but buy the original.
[02:31:36.149 --> 02:31:38.089]  And they really are good, and they really are waking folks up.
[02:31:38.149 --> 02:31:40.470]  All right, let's talk to Fred in Arizona.
[02:31:40.530 --> 02:31:41.350]  Fred, you're on the air.
[02:31:41.390 --> 02:31:41.730]  Welcome.
[02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.750]  Hi, Alex.
[02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:43.931]  You got another victory.
[02:31:43.951 --> 02:31:52.293]  The City Council of Tucson voted yesterday, 4-3, along party lines, to object to the USA Patriot Act, the 84th U.S.
[02:31:52.353 --> 02:31:53.193]  city to do so.
[02:31:54.218 --> 02:31:57.599]  Now, Steve Leal... Let me just tell you, wherever you're reading that... Let me stop you.
[02:31:57.759 --> 02:31:58.280]  Let me stop you.
[02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:00.481]  Wherever you're reading 84 City, that's not true.
[02:32:00.521 --> 02:32:01.841]  It's well over 300 right now.
[02:32:02.301 --> 02:32:04.102]  I just want to tell you, this is an article in the paper.
[02:32:04.142 --> 02:32:05.403]  I'm going to send it to you, okay?
[02:32:05.623 --> 02:32:07.323]  No, I can tell you we're reading all the paper.
[02:32:07.363 --> 02:32:07.964]  I commend you.
[02:32:07.984 --> 02:32:12.786]  What I'm saying is, the papers, either through ignorance or whatever, are minimizing the number.
[02:32:13.126 --> 02:32:15.507]  It was 300 in official numbers a month ago.
[02:32:15.567 --> 02:32:15.927]  Go ahead.
[02:32:16.267 --> 02:32:16.547]  Okay.
[02:32:16.987 --> 02:32:23.170]  Well, the Democrat Socialist Steve Leal, the resolution's primary sponsor on the City Council,
[02:32:24.016 --> 02:32:29.257]  He said, if the EPA were talking about lessening water quality standards, we'd think it was a city issue.
[02:32:29.977 --> 02:32:32.818]  But if they're polluting our rights, it is also a city issue.
[02:32:32.878 --> 02:32:34.598]  So this guy, you know, you did some good.
[02:32:34.999 --> 02:32:36.319]  And I wanted to commend you on it.
[02:32:36.399 --> 02:32:38.359]  And, you know, they got your resolution.
[02:32:38.539 --> 02:32:44.341]  Because I know at least a dozen people that sent your resolution to the city council and also to the county.
[02:32:45.281 --> 02:32:46.821]  And so you got some positive results.
[02:32:46.921 --> 02:32:47.961]  And we want to thank you for it.
[02:32:48.021 --> 02:32:49.782]  And, you know, I'm really proud that my
[02:32:50.902 --> 02:32:55.663]  Communist city government decided to support the Constitution of the United States.
[02:32:56.143 --> 02:33:04.966]  Well, Barbara Boxer last year said, let's arm all the pilots, quote, it's better to have them armed than to have an F-16 have to shoot the whole plane down.
[02:33:05.406 --> 02:33:08.187]  Bush says, no, don't arm any of the pilots.
[02:33:08.547 --> 02:33:12.428]  So yes, the Communists are now more to the right than Bush.
[02:33:13.368 --> 02:33:14.448]  Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[02:33:14.508 --> 02:33:15.309]  It is convoluted.
[02:33:15.529 --> 02:33:19.990]  All the Republicans on the city council voted to condemn the Constitution of the United States.
[02:33:20.746 --> 02:33:23.488]  And they did it based on the trust of the government.
[02:33:23.508 --> 02:33:25.329]  Now, we're supposed to trust the sheriff.
[02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:27.411]  He says that the Patriot Act is good.
[02:33:27.851 --> 02:33:30.212]  Funny, the Declaration of Independence says the opposite.
[02:33:30.653 --> 02:33:31.874]  Well, I know, but I'll ask Senator Kyle.
[02:33:31.894 --> 02:33:34.555]  We're supposed to greedily, jealously guard our rights.
[02:33:35.116 --> 02:33:42.221]  Senator Kyle from Arizona, who's a jerk, anyway, he said that we should trust the government and don't read the Patriot Act.
[02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:43.702]  You know, because the Patriot Act's on the internet.
[02:33:43.722 --> 02:33:44.462]  Anybody can read it.
[02:33:44.502 --> 02:33:45.383]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:33:45.663 --> 02:33:47.044]  Someone said we shouldn't read it?
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:48.900]  Yeah, that's Senator Kyle.
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:52.161]  K-Y-L-E, I think it is.
[02:33:52.201 --> 02:33:54.542]  Wait, you're saying he's in the paper saying don't read it?
[02:33:54.902 --> 02:34:01.103]  Yeah, in other words... You're telling me you're reading this out of the newspaper.
[02:34:01.143 --> 02:34:02.364]  Now we've reached a new level.
[02:34:02.504 --> 02:34:03.124]  Today's article.
[02:34:03.364 --> 02:34:04.304]  Arizona Daily Star.
[02:34:04.444 --> 02:34:06.305]  He says trust the government and don't read it.
[02:34:06.445 --> 02:34:06.865]  That's right.
[02:34:08.584 --> 02:34:11.306]  Well, you know, that's the kind of situation we're in.
[02:34:11.326 --> 02:34:13.307]  But anyway, my comment is, I'll get off the line.
[02:34:13.347 --> 02:34:15.489]  I wanted to thank you because your resolution really helped.
[02:34:15.809 --> 02:34:16.590]  Well, thank you?
[02:34:16.690 --> 02:34:19.031]  No, I want to thank you, Fred.
[02:34:19.532 --> 02:34:20.152]  Not me.
[02:34:20.753 --> 02:34:36.424]  I want to thank radio stations like WALE in Rhode Island, or our affiliates like WPLC in Washington, D.C., or KWNX here in Austin, or KCXL in Kansas City, or WVTJ in Pensacola, or
[02:34:37.222 --> 02:34:38.203]  The list goes on and on.
[02:34:38.223 --> 02:34:38.863]  We're all over.
[02:34:38.923 --> 02:34:42.265]  We're really getting a lot of new affiliates on the AM and FM dial.
[02:34:42.686 --> 02:34:44.627]  The internet audience is just exploding.
[02:34:45.428 --> 02:34:49.070]  People are waking up and, you know, I get this email every hour.
[02:34:49.090 --> 02:34:50.471]  Well, what are they going to kill you?
[02:34:52.412 --> 02:34:53.253]  Well, you know something?
[02:34:53.453 --> 02:34:54.153]  I have no fear.
[02:34:55.474 --> 02:34:59.377]  And if I have to die to defend my country,
[02:35:00.951 --> 02:35:09.993]  I mean, if they put a gun to my head right now and said, renounce freedom, renounce your family, renounce God, or we'll kill you, I'd say, pull the trigger, bud!
[02:35:11.233 --> 02:35:12.133]  I mean, I would!
[02:35:13.494 --> 02:35:14.174]  Go ahead!
[02:35:16.974 --> 02:35:18.595]  This is the thing about defending my family.
[02:35:20.275 --> 02:35:21.715]  And it isn't even a question.
[02:35:23.116 --> 02:35:27.276]  It is not even a question to me of what I'm supposed to do.
[02:35:28.217 --> 02:35:29.937]  There is not even a question
[02:35:31.281 --> 02:35:32.462]  It's instinctive!
[02:35:33.102 --> 02:35:51.851]  When you realize the crimes the globalists have committed, the type of people they are, the things they have done and want to do in their own policy reports, it is a THX, Matrix-like, Brave New, 1984 amalgamation.
[02:35:52.631 --> 02:35:53.292]  Literally!
[02:35:54.032 --> 02:36:00.255]  How can your humanity, that God breathed into you when he formed you in that womb,
[02:36:01.258 --> 02:36:07.286]  How can you not instinctively resist this?
[02:36:09.849 --> 02:36:19.501]  I mean, maybe I'm wired wrong or something, but I get all these comments and all these calls and all these, well you know they killed Bill Cooper, well they killed this person, well fine!
[02:36:21.875 --> 02:36:22.496]  I love life.
[02:36:22.556 --> 02:36:23.517]  I don't have a death wish.
[02:36:23.577 --> 02:36:26.539]  I mean, I enjoy... We've got thunderstorms right now.
[02:36:26.559 --> 02:36:28.301]  I love thunderstormy, dark days.
[02:36:28.461 --> 02:36:29.181]  You know, rain.
[02:36:29.201 --> 02:36:30.422]  I love sunny days.
[02:36:30.483 --> 02:36:34.286]  I love the wheat fields all cut pretty when you drive through the countryside.
[02:36:34.806 --> 02:36:35.827]  I love my dogs.
[02:36:36.388 --> 02:36:37.268]  I love my family.
[02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.971]  And I like life.
[02:36:40.191 --> 02:36:42.173]  I like, you know, riding around on a boat on the lake.
[02:36:44.738 --> 02:36:50.601]  I will not be part of committing humanity to hell on earth.
[02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:55.063]  Literal Hades on the face of the globe.
[02:36:55.443 --> 02:36:56.784]  They are setting it up.
[02:36:56.904 --> 02:36:57.765]  They are evil!
[02:36:57.785 --> 02:37:01.026]  And I'm sorry, you just haven't investigated it.
[02:37:01.546 --> 02:37:08.850]  If you don't know how evil they are, if you aren't burning with desire to expose the new world order, you're nuts!
[02:37:10.598 --> 02:37:17.782]  And if we just have this up-front, ready-to-sacrifice, ready-to-stand-up attitude about defending America, this New World Order would not be here.
[02:37:17.802 --> 02:37:23.965]  We become fat, and decadent, and always about the next pleasure, and so we're dead on the inside.
[02:37:24.005 --> 02:37:24.625]  So you know what?
[02:37:24.925 --> 02:37:25.826]  I have really lived.
[02:37:26.386 --> 02:37:27.727]  I can say that I have lived.
[02:37:28.487 --> 02:37:30.068]  I have been so alive, it hurts.
[02:37:30.889 --> 02:37:31.249]  Okay?
[02:37:32.689 --> 02:37:35.071]  I have had understandings that are painful.
[02:37:36.071 --> 02:37:38.212]  I have plumbed the depths of the New World Order.
[02:37:38.372 --> 02:37:39.453]  I can't even articulate it.
[02:37:40.009 --> 02:37:44.113]  And I know a lot of you have too, and you have perspectives that I don't have, and a lot of you are smarter than I am.
[02:37:45.875 --> 02:37:57.186]  But I know this, I am on my course, and I'll tell you this, we're a lot safer standing up and speaking out and being bold and depending on God's preservation, depending on God's providence.
[02:37:57.687 --> 02:37:58.748]  And God is real!
[02:37:59.953 --> 02:38:00.834]  I have had experiences.
[02:38:00.954 --> 02:38:01.935]  I know God is real.
[02:38:02.055 --> 02:38:02.695]  I have faith.
[02:38:03.096 --> 02:38:05.678]  And God isn't on the 700 Club, folks.
[02:38:05.718 --> 02:38:06.478]  I'm sorry to tell you.
[02:38:06.959 --> 02:38:08.320]  God isn't in these big churches.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:08.940]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:09.401 --> 02:38:10.141]  He's not, folks.
[02:38:11.122 --> 02:38:14.405]  God is in your heart if you simply let Him in.
[02:38:14.465 --> 02:38:15.686]  And that's what we're talking about here.
[02:38:15.726 --> 02:38:23.612]  And I'm telling you, if you don't hate evil and are not disgusted by it, something is wrong with you and you are not alive.
[02:38:24.253 --> 02:38:25.534]  There is not even a question.
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:28.422]  Frankly, there is not even temptation anymore.
[02:38:28.902 --> 02:38:34.407]  When you go this far, into the fight against the New World Order, it is a total commitment.
[02:38:34.447 --> 02:38:39.092]  You will be so alive, it will completely consume your life, because you will be fighting pure evil.
[02:38:39.512 --> 02:38:42.655]  You must join in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:38:44.336 --> 02:38:46.578]  It must be done now, or it's over.
[02:38:47.279 --> 02:38:48.960]  We must stop these people.
[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:50.182]  We've got to do it.
[02:38:50.982 --> 02:38:52.864]  Now, I am frankly sick of being asked,
[02:38:53.504 --> 02:38:59.587]  You know, when the government's going to whack me, when all this is going to happen, because it doesn't even matter.
[02:39:00.288 --> 02:39:02.249]  What matters is the fight against the New World Order.
[02:39:02.509 --> 02:39:14.235]  And what matters is, folks, there are millions of us, so many of us, and our numbers are growing so fast, that all this terrorism and all this police state is a response to the globalists knowing that you woke up!
[02:39:15.236 --> 02:39:17.117]  The globalists used to stomp on patriots.
[02:39:17.317 --> 02:39:19.738]  Thirty years ago, they'd kill you in a minute if you wrote a book about them.
[02:39:20.179 --> 02:39:20.559]  Now there's
[02:39:21.252 --> 02:39:23.693]  Thousands, tens of thousands of books being written a year.
[02:39:23.733 --> 02:39:24.553]  They're everywhere.
[02:39:25.073 --> 02:39:27.673]  Websites, radio shows, people involved.
[02:39:27.953 --> 02:39:28.874]  They're panicking!
[02:39:29.054 --> 02:39:30.974]  The globalists are panicking right now!
[02:39:31.454 --> 02:39:33.615]  We're winning the fight right now!
[02:39:36.315 --> 02:39:39.936]  We're winning despite all the bad things that are happening and all the stuff they're trying.
[02:39:40.916 --> 02:39:42.356]  You know Florida passed this law?
[02:39:42.516 --> 02:39:43.457]  Just learned of it yesterday?
[02:39:43.477 --> 02:39:45.477]  We're at birth.
[02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:49.772]  The CPS comes into every hospital room and tries to take your kid.
[02:39:49.812 --> 02:39:51.833]  I mean, you know, that's worse than the Soviet Union.
[02:39:52.213 --> 02:39:52.714]  And you know what?
[02:39:52.814 --> 02:39:55.656]  As that happens, more people are going to wake up, you see.
[02:39:55.936 --> 02:39:57.137]  This system can't help it.
[02:39:57.377 --> 02:39:59.759]  They're dirty, bloodthirsty dogs.
[02:40:00.299 --> 02:40:00.920]  They're evil.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:01.801]  It's their nature.
[02:40:01.841 --> 02:40:02.681]  They can't help it.
[02:40:02.721 --> 02:40:04.462]  Their master demands it of them.
[02:40:04.683 --> 02:40:06.364]  They will destroy themselves.
[02:40:07.356 --> 02:40:14.839]  Our job is to warn as many people as we can now, as we enter this zone, as we enter this phase, to stand and resist this thing.
[02:40:15.359 --> 02:40:17.180]  That's our job.
[02:40:19.561 --> 02:40:21.122]  That's our commitment.
[02:40:24.523 --> 02:40:26.584]  It's not about the consequences, my friends.
[02:40:28.064 --> 02:40:29.345]  It's about the duty.
[02:40:30.445 --> 02:40:31.526]  It's about what's right.
[02:40:32.927 --> 02:40:38.208]  I don't even think about the consequences, because I know what will happen if we don't resist the globalists.
[02:40:38.988 --> 02:40:40.468]  You've got to stop thinking about yourself.
[02:40:40.768 --> 02:40:42.449]  You've got to start thinking about humanity.
[02:40:42.489 --> 02:40:44.649]  You've got to think about the sacrifices that were made before.
[02:40:45.129 --> 02:40:47.349]  You are part of something bigger than yourself.
[02:40:47.910 --> 02:41:02.212]  Everything we've got, the freedom we've got left, this milk and honey we had, is because of all those men and women before us that sacrificed, that stood up against the crowd, that told it like it was, that said the world was round, when the crowd said it was flat.
[02:41:02.910 --> 02:41:04.872]  And I'm proud to be a part of those!
[02:41:05.152 --> 02:41:08.334]  Because there isn't going to be any humanity very soon!
[02:41:08.935 --> 02:41:14.859]  Life won't be worth living very soon if we don't stop the new, super-scientific feudalism that's upon us!
[02:41:15.319 --> 02:41:20.743]  If we don't have the honor and the courage to stand up against the neocon whores and their liberal buddies!
[02:41:23.125 --> 02:41:28.069]  Alright, we'll come back and we'll talk to, uh, talk to Joan and John.
[02:41:28.089 --> 02:41:28.449]  Final call.
[02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:29.450]  There's a lot of time for it.
[02:41:31.691 --> 02:41:32.392]  So stand up!
[02:41:32.412 --> 02:41:34.052]  You're a lot safer fighting these people.
[02:41:34.092 --> 02:41:35.053]  Have some real courage!
[02:41:35.073 --> 02:41:44.657]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.937 --> 02:41:49.679]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.899 --> 02:41:55.542]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.782 --> 02:41:56.503]  We're good to go.
[02:42:12.397 --> 02:42:14.939]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:42:15.139 --> 02:42:21.904]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:42:37.463 --> 02:42:41.968]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:42:42.308 --> 02:42:46.412]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:42:46.712 --> 02:42:47.253]  We listened.
[02:42:47.553 --> 02:42:52.558]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:42:52.818 --> 02:42:53.299]  We listened.
[02:42:53.699 --> 02:42:56.722]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:42:57.163 --> 02:42:57.683]  We listened.
[02:42:58.164 --> 02:43:01.527]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:43:01.547 --> 02:43:02.107]  We're good to go.
[02:43:28.114 --> 02:43:29.816]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:30.456 --> 02:43:33.919]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:44:39.131 --> 02:44:45.176]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:44:45.797 --> 02:44:48.819]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:55.085]  Folks, the New World Order is as evil as you can imagine, and they really do need to be resisted.
[02:44:55.605 --> 02:44:57.787]  What I'm trying to boil down in a nutshell is this.
[02:44:58.347 --> 02:45:06.194]  When you're all afraid of them and afraid of what they'll do to you, that's a climate, a system where wickedness and despotism thrives.
[02:45:06.866 --> 02:45:09.247]  That's a Russia, a China, a Nazi Germany.
[02:45:10.268 --> 02:45:21.593]  It is exciting to see people resisting the Patriot Act, to see the left and right waking up, you know, big symposiums with all the conservative Philips Show athletes and Bob Bars with the ACLU.
[02:45:21.693 --> 02:45:28.357]  That's exciting, but they're gonna blow more stuff up, the globalists are, and then say, oh look, you guys held us up from protecting us.
[02:45:28.917 --> 02:45:33.339]  We've got to not just say they're setting up a police state so that the globalists are carrying out the terror.
[02:45:33.359 --> 02:45:34.860]  If we don't do that,
[02:45:35.703 --> 02:45:36.784]  They're going to really take over.
[02:45:38.685 --> 02:45:43.347]  So it is very, very important for everyone to realize what we're facing here.
[02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:46.348]  And we've got to get the word out.
[02:45:46.388 --> 02:45:47.829]  We've got to fight the New World Order.
[02:45:48.109 --> 02:45:55.193]  And by standing up, by speaking out, by being on the record, you're a lot safer than if you just hide in the bushes.
[02:45:55.813 --> 02:45:58.915]  Then the bureaucracy is going to feed on you regardless of whose side you're on.
[02:45:58.955 --> 02:45:59.615]  They don't care.
[02:46:00.532 --> 02:46:02.292]  Don't you think the cops are scared to speak out?
[02:46:02.312 --> 02:46:03.053]  A lot of them know the truth.
[02:46:03.073 --> 02:46:04.673]  A lot of firefighters know the truth.
[02:46:04.913 --> 02:46:06.053]  They're afraid to speak out.
[02:46:06.073 --> 02:46:07.434]  They're afraid to get involved.
[02:46:08.094 --> 02:46:11.095]  Real quick, let's talk to Joan in Florida and then John in Pennsylvania.
[02:46:11.115 --> 02:46:11.775]  Go ahead, Joan.
[02:46:13.975 --> 02:46:14.976]  Can I talk to you, Joan?
[02:46:16.336 --> 02:46:17.016]  Perhaps not.
[02:46:17.096 --> 02:46:18.657]  Perhaps Joan has left us.
[02:46:19.257 --> 02:46:20.337]  No, no, I'm here.
[02:46:20.357 --> 02:46:21.337]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:46:21.377 --> 02:46:21.677]  I'm here.
[02:46:22.118 --> 02:46:24.678]  Alex, I'd like to put an alert out to Florida.
[02:46:25.338 --> 02:46:27.359]  I know you've got a lot of Florida listeners, but
[02:46:28.086 --> 02:46:32.692]  We're going to go into a police state with the new legislation if they get it through to balance the budget.
[02:46:33.212 --> 02:46:42.764]  What they want to do is to recoup enough money to balance the budget, they want to set up speed traps, drunk driving checkpoints,
[02:46:43.306 --> 02:46:46.289]  And cameras that detect people while driving through red lights.
[02:46:46.549 --> 02:46:48.250]  Yeah, I know, which then cause more wrecks.
[02:46:48.310 --> 02:46:50.472]  And of course, they really have a big surplus.
[02:46:50.512 --> 02:46:52.313]  They claim they're broke in the budget.
[02:46:52.333 --> 02:46:54.595]  You need to look at the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[02:46:54.916 --> 02:46:58.318]  Notice everything's police state now for a hundred different reasons.
[02:46:58.799 --> 02:46:59.039]  Right.
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:06.705]  They want to raise the cost of court costs and fines 200 up to 500, depending on the offense.
[02:47:07.226 --> 02:47:10.068]  And then our so-called wonderful conservative
[02:47:10.549 --> 02:47:11.270]  We're good to go.
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.981]  And another hundred million could be generated.
[02:47:30.241 --> 02:47:31.181]  Yeah, it's all a scam.
[02:47:31.201 --> 02:47:32.241]  Gotta let you go, Joan.
[02:47:32.982 --> 02:47:34.282]  Yeah, it's just out of control.
[02:47:34.402 --> 02:47:37.963]  And if you want to fight these people, you need to get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:47:38.523 --> 02:47:41.684]  Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror, my new book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:47:42.405 --> 02:47:43.785]  You need to get them, you need to make copies.
[02:47:43.825 --> 02:47:46.066]  You heard that caller earlier, how the sheriff got woken up.
[02:47:46.526 --> 02:47:49.367]  Get the videos, get them out to people so they understand what's happening.
[02:47:49.667 --> 02:47:53.288]  And this is how they make your cops act like thugs, or your forest rangers, whoever.
[02:47:53.728 --> 02:47:56.609]  They cut their funding, they're in danger of losing their job, and say, okay,
[02:47:57.282 --> 02:48:02.689]  Really get aggressive, really squeeze the people, while the economy's contracting, and you'll keep your job.
[02:48:02.809 --> 02:48:04.271]  See how they put them in that bad position?
[02:48:04.852 --> 02:48:07.475]  Get the videos, find out how the globalists operate.
[02:48:07.495 --> 02:48:08.116]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:08.136 --> 02:48:09.337]  Don't wait, make the call.
[02:48:14.744 --> 02:48:31.229]  888-253-3139 or infowares.com or prisonplanet.com or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, LAMAR, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:48:32.889 --> 02:48:35.250]  Take action, support the show, get the penalties, make copies.
[02:48:35.770 --> 02:48:38.011]  John in Pennsylvania, you got 50 seconds, go ahead.
[02:48:38.511 --> 02:48:42.112]  Hey Alex, greetings from the terroristic state of Pennsylvania, brother.
[02:48:42.924 --> 02:48:45.546]  I've got to tell you, my friend, we are making some in-modes in here.
[02:48:45.606 --> 02:48:51.512]  I've passed off probably several hundred of your titles, mainly your last three in Waco, and people are really waking up.
[02:48:51.812 --> 02:48:54.114]  What are they saying after they see who the real terrorists are?
[02:48:54.194 --> 02:48:54.855]  Real terrorists?
[02:48:55.395 --> 02:49:03.142]  Uh, I'm getting everything from reactions of almost teary-eyed, starstruck, can't say a word, back on their heels, and flat on their back, brother.
[02:49:04.165 --> 02:49:07.328]  It's looking pretty good, but I've come across a real interesting thing.
[02:49:07.368 --> 02:49:14.375]  I don't know if this is just from this area or not, but I'm finding a lot of men out there are very concrete, cranium-like.
[02:49:14.395 --> 02:49:15.756]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[02:49:15.776 --> 02:49:17.258]  Yeah, they're cowards deep down inside.
[02:49:17.278 --> 02:49:21.702]  Whereas women get conned, men are cowards and don't want to face an enemy.
[02:49:22.023 --> 02:49:24.445]  They're little cowards, but that bully's going to make them fight.
[02:49:24.805 --> 02:49:25.446]  See you back tonight.
[02:49:28.078 --> 02:49:32.590]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:49:32.930 --> 02:49:36.960]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
