[00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:05.686]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:15.362]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:17.084]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:18.905]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.386]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:22.028]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:26.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:30.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:47.014]  It's already the 5th of May, 2003.
[00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:52.077]  On this Live Monday Edition, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.678 --> 00:01:07.348]  I took Friday off, something I rarely do, because I needed to, well, get some work done around the hacienda, and I'm also working and about to complete a new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement,
[00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:19.093]  So I have a lot of news from Friday over the weekend and of course developing today that we'll be covering and I am rip roaring ready to go.
[00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:26.635]  A war emperor landed last week on that aircraft carrier Thursday night.
[00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:37.058]  A war emperor getting out of the jet strutting around one thing on his mind world government and getting your guns
[00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:40.015]  Setting up a cashless society.
[00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:41.576]  Control Grid.
[00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:47.739]  It was reminiscent of Dukakis with the helmet or Bill Clinton out assessing the troops.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.741]  But he's got an R before his name so you love him!
[00:01:53.923 --> 00:01:56.184]  You love the gun control.
[00:01:56.264 --> 00:01:57.865]  You love the open borders.
[00:01:57.965 --> 00:01:59.646]  You love the socialism.
[00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:01.627]  You love the tyranny.
[00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.287]  You love the end of America.
[00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:05.709]  You love the corniness of it all.
[00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:11.117]  Most of my listeners don't, but you've got this message now coming out from the left.
[00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:12.999]  Don't criticize Bush.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:24.710]  Chris Matthews called him the ultimate president, said he was perfect, said he was this commando, that he looked powerful getting out of the jet, that he was the greatest ever.
[00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.992]  We were so lucky to have him.
[00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.715]  How dare anyone criticize him?
[00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:31.779]  You know what's happened, don't you?
[00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.461]  You know all the liberals and beatniks have, quote, turned into neokinds.
[00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:37.982]  And, uh, they're winning right now.
[00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:39.683]  They're smart, folks!
[00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:46.886]  You know, Bush's daddy tried to be a liberal out in the open with more taxes and gun control and New World Order speeches.
[00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:47.887]  It didn't work too well.
[00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:54.590]  So, juniors back, Bill Clinton couldn't get the entire agenda through because he was such a socialist and un-American.
[00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.891]  People were aware of him.
[00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:59.553]  So now the Trojan horse, George W.
[00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:06.758]  He's 180 degrees diametrically opposed to the Constitution and liberty and freedom, but so what?
[00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:10.880]  He gives lots of speeches about liberty and freedom and how wonderful it is.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.804]  Well, people, you better look at the actions, not the rhetoric, because we're losing this country right now.
[00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:24.087]  And we're going to go over the evidence of that today.
[00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:30.170]  By the way, there's a story out of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that's on Prison Planet
[00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:47.819]  And it says that under Patriot Act, a right-winger, a conservative, a gun advocate, went and got a job at a gun shop.
[00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.200]  The man has no criminal record.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.602]  And a police officer came in and recognized him as a Patriot and called Homeland Security.
[00:03:56.622 --> 00:03:58.983]  And Homeland Security called and got him fired.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.322]  Well, they said this is the new proactive move, see?
[00:04:03.782 --> 00:04:14.350]  Homeland Security right now is training police, firemen, school teachers, administrators, that Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers, are evil and are the terrorists.
[00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.715]  There's all this talk about Arabs on the surface so conservatives don't know it's for them, but believe me, it's for you.
[00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:47.675]  It's checkpoints, it's police state, it's more government funding for government schools to dumb your kids down, it's the record federal budget, it's government takeover land, it's nightmare Twilight Zone world, and I'm sitting here, someone dedicated to liberty and freedom, watching the neocon beatniks, the dirty dirtballs,
[00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.793]  Rape this country and you're not sophisticated.
[00:04:52.873 --> 00:04:59.017]  Some of you are not sophisticated enough to see through the lies.
[00:05:01.158 --> 00:05:07.022]  Well, Larry Pratt at Gun Owners will tell you, it's the end of America and the Patriot Act too goes after your guns.
[00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:07.722]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:13.926]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.941]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:21.885]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:27.409]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.873]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:35.815]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:40.679]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:47.044]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:48.966]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:51.508]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.202]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:15.472]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.

[00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:11.113]  Energy production is always a problem.

[00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:15.472]  Big Brother.
[00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:17.192]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.912 --> 00:08:19.053]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.073 --> 00:08:20.493]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:22.193]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.814 --> 00:08:26.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:31.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:35.121]  All right, folks.
[00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:39.003]  It's Monday, already the 5th of May, 2003.
[00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:41.764]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:41.844 --> 00:08:45.845]  We're 8 minutes and 35 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:45.865 --> 00:08:49.847]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:50.627]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:56.009]  Central Standard Time and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:11.222]  Folks, it is scary when presidents, when kings, when governors start landing on board ships, start giving most of their speeches surrounded by armies.
[00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:18.127]  This is what Caesar did thousands of years ago when he crossed the Rubicon.
[00:09:19.048 --> 00:09:25.294]  George Bush is sending a message out worldwide, you follow the orders
[00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:41.852]  Of my administration, which is the machinery, the front, the figurehead of the New World Order, but we're going to blow you into little pieces, come in, put in a puppet dictatorship, and you can't stop us.
[00:09:43.273 --> 00:09:45.655]  And how do they deal with psychopaths like Kim Jong Il?
[00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:50.340]  I don't know with Korea why they give him nuclear warhead material.
[00:09:51.235 --> 00:09:52.856]  How do they deal with a Saddam?
[00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:53.797]  They give them weapons.
[00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:55.678]  How do they deal with a Syria?
[00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:56.159]  Same way.
[00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:57.440]  How do they deal with an Iran?
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.761]  How do they deal with any of these countries?
[00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:05.306]  And so Bush comes in, and the news basically was worshipping him.
[00:10:05.366 --> 00:10:16.394]  I was recording channels, and I could split from CNN to Fox, to MSNBC to CNBC, over to ABC, and they were finishing each other's sentences.
[00:10:16.594 --> 00:10:18.896]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not kidding.
[00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:28.361]  They, I have it on tape, with my cable, sitting there flipping, literally finishing each other's sentences.
[00:10:29.842 --> 00:10:32.583]  The ads were almost in the same order.
[00:10:33.223 --> 00:10:34.664]  Same advertisers, same order.
[00:10:35.864 --> 00:10:38.926]  I mean, there's no way to describe this nightmare world.
[00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:46.549]  The ads are all, put your kids on Ritalin, take Prozac, take all these new drugs,
[00:10:47.225 --> 00:10:53.147]  During the breaks, it's images of troops and foreign lands, and how the government's going to invade that government and this government.
[00:10:53.907 --> 00:10:58.568]  Bush said, hey, we got these precision weapons, we can liberate the world.
[00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:14.873]  And sure, you know, if you could buy automatic weapons at any corner store, and there weren't checkpoints and cameras and police in black ski masks and giant prisons everywhere, and helicopters flying around looking through our walls, and the government trying to ban homeschooling and going after
[00:11:15.882 --> 00:11:17.403]  I mean, I got all the news here today.
[00:11:18.423 --> 00:11:22.945]  If we weren't losing our freedom, I could probably say, oh man, we got a great government.
[00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:32.989]  They're out, you know, and if they really went in and took out dictators and then said, all right, we're going to have an election and we're not going to take over your resources and this is going to be for you.
[00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.551]  If that was really happening, I'd be all gung-ho.
[00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:38.712]  I'd probably be going and signing up, folks.
[00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.272]  But it's not.
[00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.073]  It's a fraud.
[00:11:42.093 --> 00:11:43.994]  It's a total lie.
[00:11:45.447 --> 00:11:48.149]  I can't believe how we're being enslaved here.
[00:11:48.589 --> 00:11:50.170]  I love this country so much.
[00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.392]  And we're losing everything that makes America, America.
[00:11:54.252 --> 00:11:56.053]  Not just a little police state.
[00:11:56.454 --> 00:11:59.796]  They're charting new territory.
[00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:01.757]  They're laying the groundwork.
[00:12:01.777 --> 00:12:02.897]  They're setting the trap.
[00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:07.520]  And I love this country so much.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.242]  And I go back to the central point.
[00:12:10.622 --> 00:12:14.144]  When Chris Matthews is worshipping George Bush, you know you're in trouble.
[00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:18.063]  When press is worshiping Bush, you know you're in trouble.
[00:12:18.884 --> 00:12:23.287]  When they're all worshiping him, we're in trouble.
[00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:34.195]  And, you know, I got neighbors who've got all the American flags, we support the President and the troops, all over their house.
[00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:38.379]  And whereas a year ago I'd say hi to them, I say hi to them now, folks.
[00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:44.163]  I said hi to this lady the other day, and she just looked down at the ground, and she looked at her grandchild, and she goes,
[00:12:45.003 --> 00:12:47.308]  You know, I'm on TV and on the radio here in Austin.
[00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:49.112]  Most people know who I am.
[00:12:50.243 --> 00:12:59.868]  And, you know, that same person five years ago that was bashing Bill Clinton with a gun, man, I tell you, Mr. Jones, we really appreciate you standing up against that gun grabber.
[00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:06.752]  Now Bush is actually getting the gun laws through, reinstating the old ones, and it's, you tell them, they go, shut up.
[00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:10.114]  I mean, they literally don't care about their guns, okay?
[00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:11.374]  Or their kids being free.
[00:13:12.195 --> 00:13:13.916]  They don't care about the borders being open.
[00:13:14.196 --> 00:13:17.778]  They don't care about the insanity of the new world order takeover.
[00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:20.506]  They were just like mindless liberals.
[00:13:20.606 --> 00:13:22.266]  I remember trying to tell a liberal about Bill Clinton.
[00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:28.348]  Well, he did this and that, and mean Arkansas, and corruption, and hey, guns make us safer, and Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes.
[00:13:28.368 --> 00:13:29.208]  You know, that's bad!
[00:13:29.228 --> 00:13:30.849]  And they go, shut up!
[00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:33.090]  You're just one of those dumb Republicans.
[00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.330]  You're just jealous of Bill Clinton.
[00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.051]  And I'd say, no, no, no.
[00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:39.312]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:13:39.332 --> 00:13:40.192]  I believe in freedom.
[00:13:40.572 --> 00:13:43.713]  Listen, let me explain how big government's really for the big corporations.
[00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:46.099]  And they use it, and they're not free market.
[00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:47.099]  Oh, be quiet!
[00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:48.640]  The government's going to save us!
[00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:53.942]  And now, I guess that's why I hear the Democrats, the Liberals, praising Bush.
[00:13:53.982 --> 00:13:54.622]  A lot of them are.
[00:13:54.882 --> 00:14:03.766]  Although, the neocons will act like they don't, and have a few people that are bashing them, like Rangel or somebody, trying to make it look like there's some big canyon.
[00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:05.627]  Well, there's not a canyon.
[00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.028]  They're all voting together.
[00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:27.104]  On all these issues, expansion of NAFTA and GATT, and fast track, and again the open borders, and the Pan-American Union, and the war, and Patriot Act 1 and 2, good Republican congressmen led the fight in the House, some of the mid-level ones, against the first Patriot Act.
[00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:30.845]  They were allowed to see some subsections, and they said no, and took them out.
[00:14:30.925 --> 00:14:31.706]  It went to the Senate.
[00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:38.008]  No one was allowed to read it, but now we're told three Democrats, with Democrats control at the time, three Democrats,
[00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:41.513]  That's why Bush gave them control of the Senate.
[00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:41.974]  Did you know that?
[00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:43.035]  Well, that's a whole other discussion.
[00:14:43.255 --> 00:14:44.096]  You need to research that.
[00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:46.118]  Gave them control of the Senate.
[00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:47.680]  Gave them 50-50 representation.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.401]  Never happened before.
[00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:51.604]  And then when the one went over, it was totally staged with Jeffords.
[00:14:52.626 --> 00:15:00.795]  But continuing, it goes up there and Dashiell goes in there and adds everything Ashcroft wanted
[00:15:01.983 --> 00:15:10.648]  And they transmitted over some of the really nasty clauses and they pass it, Democrats and, well, you read the headlines, you know, the Allies, Chuckie Schumer.
[00:15:11.028 --> 00:15:26.757]  I was watching a tape from a couple months ago that a listener sent me of the hearings at the Senate with Ashcroft, Mueller, and Reidge, all the triumphant strike force leaders, and
[00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:36.979]  Schumer was in such a love fest with his Republican buddies that he was about to come down off the stage.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.982]  He was worshipping them.
[00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.146]  He said, you are so powerful.
[00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.288]  You are so good.
[00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:44.202]  You are so great!
[00:15:44.342 --> 00:15:45.543]  You are so wonderful!
[00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:50.508]  And Ashcroft says, well, we do support the assault weapons ban.
[00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:52.750]  And he went, oh, goody!
[00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.153]  Oh, we're so lucky to have men as important as you!
[00:15:56.314 --> 00:15:59.457]  Oh, I just love what President Bush is doing!
[00:16:00.237 --> 00:16:01.799]  You see, I watch what they do.
[00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:02.840]  I watch it live.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.941]  People send me tapes of it.
[00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:06.123]  I sit up until four in the morning, people.
[00:16:07.421 --> 00:16:13.249]  Until I've got just stacks of documentation, so much information in my brain, I can't even begin to impart it.
[00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:16.333]  And let me just give you the newsflash.
[00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:19.978]  Hillary Clinton came out and said, this is a wonderful war.
[00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:21.600]  I just love President Bush.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.102]  Let's go into Syria.
[00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:25.961]  Let's go!
[00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:27.382]  Oh, it's so good!
[00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:30.042]  And the neocons got on the air and said, oh, look at her!
[00:16:30.082 --> 00:16:31.563]  She's just a Johnny-come-lately!
[00:16:31.603 --> 00:16:32.943]  Look at how pathetic she is!
[00:16:33.403 --> 00:16:33.804]  Oh, no!
[00:16:33.884 --> 00:16:34.384]  Don't worry!
[00:16:34.844 --> 00:16:43.326]  Bill Clinton attacked Serbia after the CIA, working with Al-Qaeda, this is a Senate report, by the way, attacked the Serbs.
[00:16:45.927 --> 00:16:47.428]  It's the same policies, folks.
[00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:50.108]  Take over, destroy every sovereign nation out there.
[00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:51.689]  That's all that's happening.
[00:16:53.496 --> 00:16:56.337]  And here, domestically, you're losing all your liberty.
[00:16:57.757 --> 00:17:01.358]  And so I watched Bush land on the deck of an aircraft carrier.
[00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:13.742]  Now, can you imagine if Bill Clinton would have been in the Texas or Arizona or Arkansas National Guard and would have shown up for two weeks and then left and not spent his other two years?
[00:17:14.142 --> 00:17:18.763]  Anyone else would have had MPs coming to the door to drag him away in chains.
[00:17:20.984 --> 00:17:21.984]  George W.
[00:17:23.463 --> 00:17:25.865]  Literally, almost got killed a bunch.
[00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:26.946]  That was in his records.
[00:17:27.206 --> 00:17:28.568]  Not a satisfactory flyer.
[00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:29.829]  Very dangerous.
[00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.591]  And he had his deferment out there.
[00:17:34.072 --> 00:17:38.136]  And I gotta admit, though, he's got more military experience than most of that administration.
[00:17:39.617 --> 00:17:43.060]  I mean, there were more military people in the Clinton administration than in this one.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.581]  It's Powell and Rumsfeld, folks.
[00:17:44.622 --> 00:17:45.002]  That's it.
[00:17:47.447 --> 00:17:59.954]  But he landed, and Chris Matthews said, you know, he's a pilot, his dad's a war hero, he looks like a war hero, look at him, he's not as big as his dad, but he looks like one of those pilots, he really, this guy, we're so lucky to have him!
[00:18:00.415 --> 00:18:05.357]  Chris Matthews, ultra-socialist, we're lucky to have Bush.
[00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:07.299]  Oh yeah, you really are lucky.
[00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:11.281]  Yeah, you pulled a fast one on these poor
[00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:24.999]  Neocon followers out there, and they're now led by literal beatniks and dregs and beady-eyed... What about that guy, that ultra-communist on, uh, MSNBC?
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.440]  Scarborough Country!
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.601]  I mean, that guy's got the beady-ass eyes, but it's not his beady eyes.
[00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:33.622]  Little beady piggy eyes.
[00:18:34.242 --> 00:18:35.962]  It's the stuff he says and does.
[00:18:36.522 --> 00:18:39.083]  That guy's about as conservative as Mao Zedong!
[00:18:41.827 --> 00:18:44.890]  Again, if those are conservatives, I'm a communist, folks.
[00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.512]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:56.820]  It's always some petty little conservative thing to talk about, but then the whole agenda is actually, big government, neutralized opposition, no criticism of government.
[00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:01.504]  We're being turned into a mass of drooling drones.
[00:19:02.504 --> 00:19:08.830]  So, do you know how Syria, you know, in Iraq, Saddam was always seen with the army and his troops.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.144]  In North Korea, the government's always seen with the army and the troops.
[00:19:13.704 --> 00:19:18.649]  In Beijing, the leaders are always seen with the army and their troops.
[00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.395]  Folks, Hitler, you know, military outfits, parades, folks,
[00:19:25.592 --> 00:19:27.834]  They're going down the checklist, okay?
[00:19:28.114 --> 00:19:29.875]  Police in black uniforms, ski masks.
[00:19:30.195 --> 00:19:31.336]  Militarizing police.
[00:19:31.616 --> 00:19:32.537]  Cameras everywhere.
[00:19:32.837 --> 00:19:34.858]  National ID cards through your driver's license.
[00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:41.963]  A military leader who lands on ships and is always seen surrounded by adoring troops.
[00:19:43.624 --> 00:19:44.585]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:45.365 --> 00:19:46.366]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:46.946 --> 00:19:48.307]  This is textbook.
[00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:49.648]  All of this.
[00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:52.590]  I don't have words to describe how bad this is.
[00:19:53.371 --> 00:20:02.743]  And now the tribal system has switched into our thinking mindset, or programmed this way, and now it's, it's, it's, it's, it's jihad!
[00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.208]  And America's going to be destroyed by these people in the process.
[00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:07.169]  I'll tell you how when we get back.
[00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:13.989]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.351]  Listen up, folks.
[00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:18.875]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:20:19.256 --> 00:20:24.642]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[00:20:25.002 --> 00:20:29.628]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:37.074]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take Sea Silver.

[00:23:15.364 --> 00:23:16.725]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:19.085]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.

[00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:05.272]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:05.292 --> 00:24:06.973]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:36.160]  Hey, I want to understand the mindset of people out there that think it's conservative to have a government taking our liberties and our guns and destroying what makes America, America.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:42.024]  I mean, I'd like to hear from the people who think that
[00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:44.711]  That Bush is really a conservative.
[00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:54.473]  And I want to hear from the people that think it's a good sign when the President, about half the time now, is seen with troops and is now even taken to wearing uniforms.
[00:24:54.513 --> 00:24:55.874]  I've seen it three times now.
[00:24:57.114 --> 00:25:08.336]  Folks, just in case you didn't know and you missed the history lesson, when leaders start hanging around with their troops and dressing like them, you better watch out globally and nationally.
[00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:10.818]  That's what the bad guys always did.
[00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.359]  America didn't do that.
[00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:15.861]  Our leaders didn't dress up in monkey suits.
[00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:19.422]  And that's what it is, and you're not actually in the military and you dress up in it.
[00:25:20.163 --> 00:25:21.544]  And I didn't strut around.
[00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:23.625]  And let me just tell you something, too.
[00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:30.288]  Again, when Chris Matthews and the liberals begin worshipping a Republican, you better look out, folks.
[00:25:30.788 --> 00:25:32.369]  Because they know what I know.
[00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:33.930]  They know the record.
[00:25:34.565 --> 00:25:45.890]  They know government's growing at a level never seen, and they know all the political correctness, and all the anti-Christian, anti-homeschooler, anti-gun stuff they wanted is now being rammed through.
[00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.950]  They know that!
[00:25:49.751 --> 00:25:51.232]  We're in serious trouble.
[00:25:51.452 --> 00:25:52.933]  I mean, look at this article here.
[00:25:53.513 --> 00:25:56.874]  Well, before I get to these articles, toll-free number, what do you think of what I'm saying?
[00:25:56.894 --> 00:26:01.296]  Do you understand how crazy it is to see this happening in this country?
[00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:02.326]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:26:02.346 --> 00:26:14.332]  See, the choice isn't you're some ultra-leftist who's against the war because you're for the UN and for their world government.
[00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:23.236]  And the only other choice isn't, well, you're for Bush because he's a good old boy and he lives at a ranch in Grover down the road from where I sit.
[00:26:24.357 --> 00:26:28.259]  With literal fake tractors, you know, tractors and hay bales parked around it.
[00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:30.820]  It's a set for you.
[00:26:32.578 --> 00:26:33.459]  It's theater!
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.360]  No!
[00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:45.008]  We need to realize we have a corrupt propaganda state, a Madison Avenue advertising agency system, selling you an illusion!
[00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.230]  It's an illusion!
[00:26:47.511 --> 00:26:48.712]  You're like, what do you mean an illusion?
[00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:51.054]  Well, I haven't used this example in about a month, so I'll use it again.
[00:26:51.074 --> 00:26:53.355]  Remember about three months ago Bush was in St.
[00:26:53.415 --> 00:26:53.716]  Louis?
[00:26:55.307 --> 00:26:58.509]  It was a drive to get the economy going, free trade.
[00:26:58.829 --> 00:26:59.849]  He wants to expand it.
[00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:02.670]  He met, and they couldn't find in a whole warehouse.
[00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.431]  This was in the news.
[00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.612]  The White House Press Secretary had to admit it.
[00:27:06.652 --> 00:27:09.494]  They couldn't find one box that said, Made in America.
[00:27:10.614 --> 00:27:14.556]  Nowhere in a giant complex of warehouses in St.
[00:27:14.596 --> 00:27:14.936]  Louis.
[00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:18.378]  In weeks leading up to this photo op.
[00:27:18.818 --> 00:27:22.880]  So they got a stencil out and sprayed in giant letters, Made in the USA.
[00:27:23.928 --> 00:27:26.329]  And they had to cover up with stickers the Made in China.
[00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.132]  And Bush got up there and said, look at all these products.
[00:27:30.472 --> 00:27:31.192]  Made in America.
[00:27:31.312 --> 00:27:32.293]  Our economy is strong.
[00:27:33.133 --> 00:27:33.834]  Expand.
[00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:34.974]  Give me fast track.
[00:27:35.034 --> 00:27:36.195]  Expand my ability.
[00:27:37.176 --> 00:27:39.317]  Now, they knew what they were doing.
[00:27:40.597 --> 00:27:41.658]  You're like, oh, Bush didn't.
[00:27:41.718 --> 00:27:42.579]  He's a good man.
[00:27:42.639 --> 00:27:43.539]  He's a good Christian.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.421]  Skull and Bones is a Christian organization.
[00:27:47.942 --> 00:27:49.583]  Of course Bush didn't.
[00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:51.984]  Reading off a teleprompter books.
[00:27:54.494 --> 00:27:59.618]  But the point is the administration, the people running things did, and it's about an illusion.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.081]  It's an illusion.
[00:28:03.402 --> 00:28:04.002]  It's simple.
[00:28:04.663 --> 00:28:22.778]  So those feelings you have, that emotion you have that's driving out the thought process, you better look at Grandpa's gun and care about it and the freedom and heritage it represents a lot more than you love the beady-eyed Coneybunkport, Maine British Royal.
[00:28:25.738 --> 00:28:29.541]  Hey, I'm a Texan, and let me tell you, that ain't no Texan.
[00:28:30.482 --> 00:28:47.096]  And I don't care where you're from, just please don't come to my state in carpetbagger fashion, shut up shop, and then tell me how Texan you are, and do all your little fake, uh, Kearnsies, and your little smileys, and the cowboy hats, I'm about to puke!
[00:28:49.037 --> 00:28:54.462]  Only time somebody who's really a cowboy wears a cowboy hat is a straw hat when they're out working.
[00:28:56.662 --> 00:28:59.747]  Bush says, weapons will be found in Iraq.
[00:28:59.847 --> 00:29:00.768]  Oh, will be?
[00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:03.512]  Yes, they said, oh don't worry, we're going to find them.
[00:29:04.614 --> 00:29:08.460]  And you ask, why do they keep finding them, announcing they're real, and having to admit they're not real?
[00:29:09.611 --> 00:29:26.181]  Well, that's a psychological warfare tactic to make you think, oh, they look bad, oh, everybody's, you know, the president's getting questioned, oh, this is going to hurt him if they can't, and they're going to find the big mother load and everybody's going to go, ooooh, don't you question him!
[00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:28.262]  Again, he's proven right!
[00:29:28.582 --> 00:29:34.746]  The instincts of this president, the way he set up this administration, the way he knew all this, he's proven everyone wrong!
[00:29:35.612 --> 00:29:38.232]  This makes it look more legitimate when they find them.
[00:29:38.713 --> 00:29:41.673]  I've never jumped on this bandwagon and, oh, they're not going to find them.
[00:29:42.053 --> 00:29:44.294]  No, Saddam surely did have chemicals and weapons.
[00:29:45.554 --> 00:29:46.754]  Because we never sold it to him.
[00:29:46.774 --> 00:29:48.174]  It's like the editorial cartoon.
[00:29:48.694 --> 00:29:49.835]  Well, boy, how do you know you'll find them?
[00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:50.695]  Well, we kept the receipt.
[00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:51.075]  Ha!
[00:29:51.375 --> 00:29:51.935]  My daddy!
[00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:52.735]  My daddy!
[00:29:52.755 --> 00:29:54.635]  Oh, but I switched back into my real accent.
[00:29:54.895 --> 00:29:56.356]  My father sold them to him.
[00:29:56.576 --> 00:29:57.316]  Ho ho!
[00:30:00.556 --> 00:30:01.457]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.937 --> 00:30:03.437]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:07.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.463 --> 00:30:15.868]  Are you aware that the equivalent of everything you earn from January to the middle of May was taken for taxes?
[00:30:16.168 --> 00:30:20.272]  On the average, nearly five months of every year are spent working just to pay the IRS.
[00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:21.613]  Get thousands of get forms.
[00:30:21.973 --> 00:30:23.515]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:30:33.843 --> 00:30:39.888]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:43.511]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:47.334 --> 00:30:55.440]  Later, I'm going to read some of his lordship's comments here on the air.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.082]  The new war emperor that we have,
[00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:09.409]  He said that we have the weapons, we, again that's psychology as if we're part of this takeover, to attack all these countries and rid them of their evil leaders and give them good leadership.
[00:31:10.069 --> 00:31:11.509]  Give them a good country.
[00:31:12.449 --> 00:31:13.270]  But here's the problem.
[00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.290]  We're losing our freedom here domestically.
[00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.851]  They're setting up real, genuine, black tyranny.
[00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:20.131]  I mean the worst type.
[00:31:20.552 --> 00:31:26.373]  Pitch dark hit of misery, corruption, and tyranny.
[00:31:27.654 --> 00:31:39.423]  And then in Iraq, $7 million contracts to Halliburton, and contracts to Bechtel, and an incredibly corrupt dying corps getting the deal, and it says that for a month's work, they're really doing the Iraqis a favor.
[00:31:40.203 --> 00:31:44.166]  There's hardly any food or water, and you got a population of 20 million people.
[00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:47.889]  Some of them that are lucky will get $20 a month.
[00:31:47.949 --> 00:31:49.650]  Isn't our government nice?
[00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:53.073]  Now, they're gonna have oil-fueled slaves.
[00:31:53.877 --> 00:31:55.739]  For less than a dollar a day.
[00:31:55.759 --> 00:32:03.044]  Folks, they could pay those people tens of thousands of dollars apiece and not even begin to approach a tenth of the cruise missiles fired.
[00:32:04.585 --> 00:32:06.227]  I mean, just blatant slavery.
[00:32:06.707 --> 00:32:12.071]  Twenty dollars apiece for a month's work.
[00:32:12.852 --> 00:32:15.794]  And now they say cholera is spreading all over the country.
[00:32:15.874 --> 00:32:16.595]  Dysentery.
[00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:19.437]  And they are setting up a dictatorship.
[00:32:19.477 --> 00:32:21.819]  They are putting regional governors in.
[00:32:23.023 --> 00:32:27.707]  All former Ba'ath Party officials in the 23 ministries, that is official.
[00:32:27.767 --> 00:32:32.891]  White House last week, most of Saddam's former people, most of them trained in the U.S.
[00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:33.831]  by the CIA.
[00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:41.417]  There was a CIA government under Saddam until they broke, when he followed orders to invade Kuwait and got a lot of trouble.
[00:32:41.437 --> 00:32:45.440]  They set him up as Saddam sent an ITN, now comes to living in Russia.
[00:32:46.474 --> 00:32:54.501]  Aziz is going to get to live at a 144,000 acre estate, one of Prince Charles' hundreds of estates, in Scotland.
[00:32:54.521 --> 00:32:59.665]  He's going to be out there with millions of pounds a year, flown around by helicopter to the shopping malls.
[00:32:59.765 --> 00:33:00.406]  I'm not kidding.
[00:33:01.126 --> 00:33:02.327]  That's what Aziz is going to get.
[00:33:02.388 --> 00:33:08.693]  When they're good and ready, Aziz will come out and say, yes, we had chemicals, and now I will retire to my lavish abode.
[00:33:09.961 --> 00:33:14.083]  Yeah, you know, Saddam was working with them since 1958.
[00:33:14.143 --> 00:33:16.864]  So, see, we remember all of this.
[00:33:18.885 --> 00:33:24.308]  But now Bush is warning Syria, warning Iran, warning North Korea.
[00:33:24.328 --> 00:33:27.929]  Two weeks ago, Rumsfeld's attack plans got released.
[00:33:28.289 --> 00:33:31.711]  The battle plan to attack North Korea in October.
[00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:49.768]  Isn't it funny that Rumsfeld's the man that was on the board of ABB arming, in the specific deal, the nuclear reactors so they could produce nuclear bombs, warheads, that go in those MIRV canisters, up there, back in 1997 and 8.
[00:33:51.249 --> 00:33:56.394]  We have those articles, mainstream for you, at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:33:59.719 --> 00:34:01.520]  So, see, I remember all of this.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.381]  Do you remember all of this?
[00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:05.061]  Does this upset you?
[00:34:05.622 --> 00:34:12.925]  We'll take your calls on this issue or any other issue you want to discuss.
[00:34:12.945 --> 00:34:24.730]  1-800-259-9231 on this live, on this live Monday edition of the Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.492]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes and boy do I have a lot of news here.
[00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.792]  But before I go any further, a couple quick announcements.
[00:34:32.473 --> 00:34:40.039]  I rarely travel, but I will be up at KCXL 1140 that carries the daytime show.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.003]  KCXL 1140 for the Liberty Factor, May 17th.
[00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.844]  That's a couple weeks from now on a Saturday.
[00:34:47.264 --> 00:34:52.188]  May 17th, and that's going to be from 10 a.m.
[00:34:52.248 --> 00:34:53.309]  to 9 p.m.
[00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:55.511]  Colonel Craig Roberts and others will be there speaking.
[00:34:56.724 --> 00:35:20.190]  And I'll be speaking for several hours and doing a presentation and it's going to be a great event and it's a benefit for KCXL and I hope to see everybody there at the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center 5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard between I-70 between Kansas City and Independence Missouri.
[00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:25.591]  So that's the 17th and you need to go ahead and call KCXL and find out details
[00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:34.010]  If you're in that area, I'm going to have to post something on my website for people that want to go to it but can't hear us on the AM there.
[00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.651]  But you just got the basics, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll be announcing more about that.
[00:35:39.051 --> 00:35:42.752]  And then the other little tidbit is very important.
[00:35:42.912 --> 00:35:47.473]  Herbal healer products really are good.
[00:35:47.493 --> 00:35:48.613]  I've gotten some myself.
[00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:52.067]  Have pleasant-scented, water-based insect repellent.
[00:35:52.527 --> 00:35:58.190]  I tell ya, if you knew what was in the stuff that you buy over the counter, believe me, you don't want to put that on your skin.
[00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.352]  There are natural ways to deter the insects this summer and this spring.
[00:36:05.007 --> 00:36:07.708]  And with West Nile, it's always important to do that.
[00:36:08.009 --> 00:36:13.291]  So, pleasant scented, water-based, insect repellent, natural pet and livestock products.
[00:36:13.331 --> 00:36:14.291]  That's really great.
[00:36:14.732 --> 00:36:28.718]  Tree catalogs and newsletters, naturopathic correspondence programs, home study courses, floidal silver, MSM, sulfur capsules, olive leaf capsules, vitamin C, natural sources of that, that are around you and your environment.
[00:36:28.798 --> 00:36:32.240]  Books on what area you are in the country, what you can get, what you can do.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.501]  Very important survival information.
[00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:39.260]  Call Herbal Healer Academy for your free newsletter at 870-269-4177.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.440]  870-269-4177.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:50.263]  Or visit their website at HerbalHealer.com for a list of wonderful products.
[00:36:50.303 --> 00:36:52.003]  Again, 870-269-4177.
[00:36:52.123 --> 00:36:54.944]  Or HerbalHealer.com.
[00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:59.025]  We have a banner to HerbalHealer.com on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:59.045 --> 00:37:01.105]  So be sure and drop by and check out what they have to offer.
[00:37:01.365 --> 00:37:02.686]  They've been around for, I don't know, 18 years.
[00:37:04.654 --> 00:37:13.940]  And they're great folks, really teaching people how to protect themselves and what's naturally occurring in the environment for you.
[00:37:15.621 --> 00:37:17.903]  Bush says weapons will be found in Iraq.
[00:37:18.003 --> 00:37:19.204]  And hey, I believe him.
[00:37:19.384 --> 00:37:20.825]  You know, it's going to be the big victory.
[00:37:22.386 --> 00:37:23.686]  You understand the psychology.
[00:37:23.726 --> 00:37:24.747]  They do this all the time.
[00:37:25.488 --> 00:37:27.469]  Oh, he better do a good job in Iraq.
[00:37:27.509 --> 00:37:29.170]  They better win this thing easier.
[00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.592]  This is a big test for his administration.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:41.142]  They got special forces behind enemy lines with those Saddam Hussein Republican Guard generals who were trained here in the 70s and 80s.
[00:37:42.162 --> 00:37:47.164]  Our government has massive dossiers on them, admits they gave them now gold bars, all the goodies.
[00:37:49.264 --> 00:37:50.465]  And so they knew that would happen.
[00:37:51.785 --> 00:37:54.586]  And so they only bet on things that are assured.
[00:37:54.606 --> 00:38:02.788]  And then you see them saying, oh, they've been caught, you know, with all these fake reports,
[00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:06.511]  of chemical and biological weapons.
[00:38:08.513 --> 00:38:10.275]  Oh, they're in trouble on this subject.
[00:38:10.775 --> 00:38:11.856]  Why haven't they found them?
[00:38:11.936 --> 00:38:24.488]  And see, all these false positives makes it look like they're really looking and they're desperate and they're really out there telling the truth because it keeps coming up negative and they were going to lie and come up positive.
[00:38:25.509 --> 00:38:26.429]  Well, folks, don't worry.
[00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.991]  It's going to come up positive.
[00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:29.032]  Don't you worry.
[00:38:30.484 --> 00:38:36.266]  And I have no doubt, I've been saying this since before the war, they have run across so much chemical weapons, it's probably ridiculous.
[00:38:36.786 --> 00:38:38.667]  But there's no way to really even get rid of that stuff.
[00:38:39.827 --> 00:38:45.289]  I mean, our government's been trying for years, but so much of it, it's so dangerous, it's hard to do.
[00:38:46.767 --> 00:38:49.569]  But the problem is, most of it was made by the U.S.
[00:38:49.629 --> 00:38:53.491]  government, so that's why they couldn't treat the troops in the first Cold War.
[00:38:53.812 --> 00:39:05.319]  When they came back, the chemical weapons detectors went off, because you can't treat the troops when it was your nerve gas that hit them, when it was your government that ordered the stuff be blown up to cover up evidence of who sold it to Saddam.
[00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:13.324]  So I have no doubt that they found chemical weapons, but they're trying to find some Russian or Syrian or something.
[00:39:14.016 --> 00:39:16.517]  And as they wade over all the Israeli and U.S.
[00:39:16.557 --> 00:39:23.181]  weapons, as they wade over all of that and stumble over all of it, and, you know, the U.S.
[00:39:23.301 --> 00:39:37.409]  spray fittings for the helicopters and the CIA advisors there teaching them how to nerve gas people in the late 80s, I mean, you know, you can't just show U.S.-made chemical weapons dispersers and go, look, we found it, you know.
[00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.390]  It's kind of hard.
[00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.232]  It's kind of hard to do that.
[00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:47.849]  That's why, I guess, when they take over North Korea, that's going to be serious.
[00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:48.990]  They're getting you into it.
[00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:50.611]  Some easier victories.
[00:39:51.892 --> 00:39:57.335]  And maybe they think they can just bomb all the leadership and contact the others and promise some gold bars.
[00:39:58.475 --> 00:39:59.596]  That may work with the Arabs.
[00:39:59.616 --> 00:40:01.177]  The Arabs don't generally fight too hard.
[00:40:01.517 --> 00:40:06.160]  Some of them are fanatics and will run out and get shot, fight you with a machine gun against a tank.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.042]  But the North Koreans, the experience that we've seen with the Asians,
[00:40:10.771 --> 00:40:14.694]  Especially in that neck of the woods, is they will fight.
[00:40:15.094 --> 00:40:25.702]  And examples of this is many times they've caught North Korean patrol boats in the southern area and the guys take cyanide pills in every case before anyone can even get on the boat.
[00:40:28.484 --> 00:40:30.585]  So, I don't know folks.
[00:40:31.446 --> 00:40:36.670]  They are, well they're what Americans will be under homeland security another decade in North Korea.
[00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.971]  This mindless
[00:40:38.857 --> 00:40:40.198]  Totally believe the lies.
[00:40:40.798 --> 00:40:45.641]  Totally believe Kim Jong-il and his proclamations from his seven-story Pleasure Palace.
[00:40:46.662 --> 00:40:49.924]  So, uh, kind of like the Pleasure Palace, they've got a Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:51.565]  They're all kind of into that stuff.
[00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:56.789]  Uh, I guess it's Christian, then, because, you know, if you're a member of Skull and Bones, you're Christian now.
[00:40:56.809 --> 00:40:58.190]  If you're an actual Christian, you're bad.
[00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.231]  I forget, I've got to learn these definitions.
[00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.912]  You're anti-gun, you're conservative.
[00:41:03.073 --> 00:41:07.556]  Uh, oh, I know you gave me a bunch of calls, Mark, but who'd you say was up first?
[00:41:10.698 --> 00:41:12.460]  Elliot New York, you're on the air.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:12.901]  Welcome.
[00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:14.883]  Oh man, I'm glad to bat up first.
[00:41:15.463 --> 00:41:16.785]  You're up first of the plate.
[00:41:16.805 --> 00:41:17.405]  What's going on?
[00:41:18.186 --> 00:41:24.894]  Well, I think, I think, um, well first of all I want to say that Live 365 Info Warrior Radio thing is awesome.
[00:41:25.154 --> 00:41:27.897]  Because when you're not on live, I get to listen to you on the weekends.
[00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:38.185]  Well, you know, at PrisonPlanet.com, we have over a hundred of my best interviews saved there, thanks to the webmaster.
[00:41:38.646 --> 00:41:39.606]  You can go listen to those.
[00:41:39.646 --> 00:41:41.766]  Yeah, I check those out, too.
[00:41:41.986 --> 00:41:44.047]  But, you know, when you're done with those, you've got to jump to something else.
[00:41:44.347 --> 00:41:46.027]  Oh, well, I appreciate the listenership.
[00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:46.848]  What's going on?
[00:41:47.228 --> 00:41:56.510]  Well, you know, I'm obviously here in New York, and like I've been saying for a long time, this is one of the best vestiges of the New World Order.
[00:41:57.176 --> 00:42:08.041]  Also, um, I think all that Huxley put it perfectly when he described in the future, which, you know, he said in the 60s, would be a monolithic, scientifically crafted dictatorship.
[00:42:08.542 --> 00:42:11.363]  And that's what we're seeing today with this New World Order.
[00:42:11.543 --> 00:42:16.005]  Yeah, I've, did you hear me when I aired the Huxley tape?
[00:42:16.485 --> 00:42:16.686]  Yep.
[00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:19.087]  For those that don't know, he wrote Brave New World.
[00:42:19.127 --> 00:42:23.529]  His brother was first Secretary General of UNESCO that Bush has signed on to and said we need
[00:42:24.252 --> 00:42:27.935]  For sterilization, controlled hives, drugging of the population.
[00:42:28.555 --> 00:42:31.418]  Huxley got all of that from his family.
[00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:40.905]  And Huxley came to Berkeley right before he died, gave a speech, kind of his mea culpa, and said, I've been to the labs.
[00:42:40.945 --> 00:42:43.207]  People have chips in their heads already in England.
[00:42:43.847 --> 00:42:46.349]  What I wrote is what I believe will be the future by 2000.
[00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.872]  Again, they're a little bit behind schedule, but almost there.
[00:42:49.892 --> 00:42:51.613]  He said, this is the plan.
[00:42:52.033 --> 00:42:57.095]  And he went into the incredible... He said, I can't describe all the propaganda, how it works, but he went into some of it.
[00:42:57.616 --> 00:43:00.157]  And it's an amazing speech he gave.
[00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:00.537]  Go ahead.
[00:43:00.837 --> 00:43:01.157]  It is.
[00:43:01.237 --> 00:43:01.437]  It is.
[00:43:01.657 --> 00:43:06.940]  And also, that communism documentary was awesome, too.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.082]  I mean, the way he was describing it, it was freaking me out, because this is in the 60s.
[00:43:12.102 --> 00:43:14.023]  This guy is talking about all this stuff in the 60s.
[00:43:14.483 --> 00:43:15.143]  It's happening now.
[00:43:16.064 --> 00:43:16.464]  Incredible.
[00:43:17.253 --> 00:43:19.215]  You know, how he'd get black and white to fight.
[00:43:19.955 --> 00:43:22.538]  You know, how he would take down the infrastructure.
[00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:25.060]  You know, Y2K was an example of that.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.141]  You know, the fear.
[00:43:26.381 --> 00:43:27.262]  Well, it's drills.
[00:43:27.322 --> 00:43:27.662]  Yeah.
[00:43:27.903 --> 00:43:29.264]  They don't have to actually do something.
[00:43:29.624 --> 00:43:30.265]  It's the fear of it.
[00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:31.826]  Like, they're going to have top-off two.
[00:43:32.186 --> 00:43:40.534]  And top-off one, they practice rounding people up, putting them in sports stadiums, shutting down all the highways, taking over all radio and TV nationwide.
[00:43:41.474 --> 00:43:46.998]  Now they're going to have top off to the Washington Post's reporting, and they say it's going to dwarf the one before.
[00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:53.303]  They're training to shut everything down in Institute level 10 martial law.
[00:43:53.683 --> 00:43:55.445]  See, we're already under martial law, but it's what?
[00:43:55.525 --> 00:43:55.905]  Increment?
[00:43:56.465 --> 00:43:57.346]  Oh, we're ready.
[00:43:57.546 --> 00:43:59.087]  Oh, in New York City?
[00:43:59.167 --> 00:44:01.489]  I think we're the only state in the union that's still on the orange.
[00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:03.771]  We're still on orange, Alex.
[00:44:05.337 --> 00:44:08.200]  Actually, they tell all the capital cities they're still on orange.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.541]  Austin is still on orange.
[00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:13.464]  They have little Pentagon briefings with the top police and make them feel all important.
[00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:16.226]  Right now, they're setting up.
[00:44:17.027 --> 00:44:17.568]  It's horrible.
[00:44:19.382 --> 00:44:26.847]  Elliot, do you get what I'm saying when I talk about in China, the leaders are always seen in public with their military, being paraded in military outfits.
[00:44:26.968 --> 00:44:28.929]  The leader wears a military uniform.
[00:44:29.289 --> 00:44:30.510]  Kim Jong-il does it.
[00:44:30.951 --> 00:44:33.893]  Yeah, but at least they served in the military.
[00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:35.454]  But this is what I'm saying, though.
[00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:43.501]  In Germany, in Russia, in all the countries that have gone bad, the leader is always in military outfits, hanging around with the military.
[00:44:44.061 --> 00:44:47.744]  Now it's started here, and I don't think people get how serious this is.
[00:44:48.618 --> 00:44:50.579]  Well, they're too busy watching Joe Millionaire, you know?
[00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:55.323]  They're too busy, they're too busy worried about who's going to win American Idol.
[00:44:55.363 --> 00:44:57.744]  And I don't think there's anything wrong with those shows or anything like that.
[00:44:58.385 --> 00:45:00.266]  But, you know, because the human mind is beautiful.
[00:45:00.346 --> 00:45:04.809]  It can hold and retain more information than what Americans, on a constant basis, can hold.
[00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.012]  But, I just think that people, not so much need to wake up.
[00:45:09.032 --> 00:45:09.692]  People are awake.
[00:45:09.712 --> 00:45:13.875]  They just need to get some, you know, get the yellow off their back and start fighting this.
[00:45:14.495 --> 00:45:15.016]  I hear you.
[00:45:15.616 --> 00:45:16.817]  I appreciate the call, Elliot.
[00:45:17.475 --> 00:45:18.816]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[00:45:18.956 --> 00:45:23.280]  I'm always slow to start getting the calls, and we will, of course, jam a bunch of them in.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:23.580]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:29.525]  And maybe you just want to deny what I'm saying.
[00:45:29.645 --> 00:45:30.826]  Oh, that guy's crazy.
[00:45:30.866 --> 00:45:40.093]  Well, you heard, you know, us crazies 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25 years ago talk about the New World Order, and the news said it doesn't exist.
[00:45:40.153 --> 00:45:45.678]  Crazy people talk about it, and now they've announced a New World Order with a world court, a world bank, no rights.
[00:45:46.872 --> 00:45:50.935]  A world ID card, through your federal ID card, down to your state ID card.
[00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:55.179]  I told you five, six, seven years ago they put thumb scanners in the banks, the grocery stores.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.201]  I told you they used terror to get total control.
[00:45:58.602 --> 00:45:59.903]  I made films about it.
[00:46:00.944 --> 00:46:03.866]  Years before, I was on the record, so were many others.
[00:46:06.148 --> 00:46:11.072]  And so you remember, we told you all of this, and now you've seen it happen.
[00:46:11.112 --> 00:46:12.013]  So what are you going to do?
[00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:20.881]  The biggest thing we face is the overnight talk sensation types that talk about deliberate disinformation on purpose.
[00:46:21.542 --> 00:46:26.964]  They'll have five stupid guests for one good guest that talks about real information.
[00:46:27.804 --> 00:46:42.089]  What that then does is when the average American hears somebody talk about FEMA's corrupt world government, they've heard that mixed in with the Green Martians from the South Pole or Planet X or whatever.
[00:46:43.024 --> 00:46:45.005]  And then it neutralizes all of it.
[00:46:45.065 --> 00:46:46.486]  It's the poison pill.
[00:46:47.447 --> 00:46:52.350]  Whereas everything we talk about here is proven, and is documented, and is in your face.
[00:46:53.490 --> 00:47:00.295]  I was doing my TV show last Thursday night, and somebody calls in and goes, I don't believe that's a Patriot Act you've got in front of you.
[00:47:00.875 --> 00:47:02.216]  And I said, well, sir, here's the bill.
[00:47:02.236 --> 00:47:06.378]  You go to the subsections, thomas.loc.gov, Library of Congress.
[00:47:06.858 --> 00:47:08.259]  Believe me, this is the bill.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.440]  I don't believe it.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.321]  I don't want to believe it.
[00:47:10.341 --> 00:47:10.901]  You're a liar.
[00:47:11.539 --> 00:47:13.961]  And I said, well, sir, can you at least go check out what I'm saying?
[00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:15.862]  No, I don't have to believe it.
[00:47:16.263 --> 00:47:19.225]  I can believe what I want, and that makes it, you know, real for me.
[00:47:20.606 --> 00:47:22.327]  And I said, sir, you are the future man.
[00:47:23.268 --> 00:47:25.010]  You are the one that goes forward into the future.
[00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:30.234]  I guess those that know how to go read a bill are bad, but you are the future.
[00:47:30.254 --> 00:47:33.076]  You can just, 2 plus 2 can equal 5 or 10 or 3.
[00:47:33.896 --> 00:47:35.898]  And if Big Brother says so, it does.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.761]  I mean, that's really it, isn't it?
[00:47:40.994 --> 00:47:43.315]  And, uh, I rarely run into those.
[00:47:43.775 --> 00:47:44.956]  Years ago I would all the time.
[00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:48.417]  And then he said, uh, the county doesn't take people's houses.
[00:47:49.198 --> 00:47:55.141]  I just showed him news pieces where they admitted they're taking record numbers of people's homes that can't pay their property taxes.
[00:47:55.701 --> 00:47:58.082]  And the guy just says, they're not taking homes, you're a liar!
[00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.610]  And I said, sir, we just showed you video of it.
[00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.031]  They're all in the newspaper, all over the news, with the houses they've taken.
[00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:05.652]  He goes, no, you're a liar.
[00:48:05.672 --> 00:48:06.572]  The government isn't bad.
[00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:07.173]  The government's good.
[00:48:07.193 --> 00:48:09.333]  And I said, sir, the government does take people's houses.
[00:48:09.634 --> 00:48:10.294]  No, they don't.
[00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:10.914]  You're lying.
[00:48:11.654 --> 00:48:13.715]  It's just la-la land.
[00:48:14.816 --> 00:48:17.757]  Total la-la land.
[00:48:17.777 --> 00:48:20.358]  All right, I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:48:20.418 --> 00:48:22.019]  I mean, it's just bonker land.
[00:48:23.539 --> 00:48:25.740]  People are being arrested for shooting rattlesnakes.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.441]  Kids are being arrested for saying no.
[00:48:28.664 --> 00:48:29.925]  They're right back, just stay with us.
[00:48:31.966 --> 00:48:39.351]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:44.374]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:44.594 --> 00:48:50.238]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.478 --> 00:49:02.388]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:49:02.409 --> 00:49:06.932]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:49:07.113 --> 00:49:09.615]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:49:09.835 --> 00:49:16.561]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:51:26.553 --> 00:51:55.915]  Later in the next hour, I've got Christopher Clickum, Senior Counsel and Staff Attorney, Director of State and International Relations for the Home School Legal Defense
[00:51:57.193 --> 00:52:05.237]  Association, um, they're trying to say homeschooling is illegal now in several states and saying it's child abuse as they win all the big awards.
[00:52:05.257 --> 00:52:13.142]  The little Taiwanese 13-year-old just won the big Intel Science Prize and they said because he's homeschooler we can't believe this.
[00:52:13.242 --> 00:52:14.482]  Or really they won all the other awards.
[00:52:15.023 --> 00:52:18.845]  They had all these scientists try to disprove it and ask the kid to redo it and the kid did it.
[00:52:20.486 --> 00:52:23.027]  Yeah, you can't fake knowing how to spell those words either.
[00:52:23.387 --> 00:52:24.928]  You can't fake the geography bees.
[00:52:26.008 --> 00:52:32.410]  But now they're trying to just outright ban it and they got a new show on the WB coming out that attacks homeschoolers.
[00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:42.154]  They've got t-shirts all over the malls that say homeschool with school spelled wrong with a trailer park shack.
[00:52:42.554 --> 00:52:43.635]  It's an attack on you!
[00:52:45.615 --> 00:52:46.476]  And then look at this article.
[00:52:46.536 --> 00:52:48.797]  Government lawyers say burglars need protection.
[00:52:48.817 --> 00:52:49.817]  That's the London Independent.
[00:52:50.825 --> 00:52:55.108]  Government lawyers trying to keep the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin behind bars.
[00:52:55.208 --> 00:53:02.614]  We'll tell a high court judge tomorrow that burglars are members of the public who must be protected from violent householders.
[00:53:04.295 --> 00:53:08.718]  And they are arresting anyone that resists the burglar.
[00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:12.421]  A woman stabbed a burglar who was raping her.
[00:53:12.641 --> 00:53:13.742]  She has been arrested.
[00:53:13.762 --> 00:53:16.684]  Yes, this is the way things are.
[00:53:17.364 --> 00:53:18.505]  They want total terror.
[00:53:18.685 --> 00:53:19.826]  Criminals work for the government.
[00:53:20.345 --> 00:53:29.247]  That's why you get 5 years if you cut somebody's head off in most states, but if you're caught with some drugs and you're 19, you'll get 10 years.
[00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:37.309]  Because you're a good, non-violent, whack-and-hut widget maker, and you drive down the wages and compete against the free market at 18 cents an hour.
[00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:40.149]  Oh yeah, you guys go, make the imprisoners work!
[00:53:40.489 --> 00:53:41.770]  Okay, they'll just take your job away.
[00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.390]  You would have gotten 20 bucks as a machinist.
[00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:44.710]  Now you're not getting jacked.
[00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:45.430]  How's that sound?
[00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.691]  The illegals will take the second tier job for $5 an hour from you.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.820]  Again, this is all set up, folks.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.221]  It's not the liberal debate.
[00:53:53.241 --> 00:53:54.321]  It's not the conservative debate.
[00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.101]  It's the facts.
[00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:57.322]  It's what this stuff does to us.
[00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:03.203]  And here in this country, no more musical chairs, no more dodgeball, no more tag.
[00:54:03.343 --> 00:54:04.483]  Children are being arrested.
[00:54:05.283 --> 00:54:06.504]  Children are being arrested.
[00:54:06.544 --> 00:54:11.965]  They refuse pledges, certain particular anti-violence pledges, mind control pledges.
[00:54:13.645 --> 00:54:16.646]  Again, a man was arrested for shooting a rattlesnake, was trying to attack him.
[00:54:18.935 --> 00:54:22.316]  Civilian deaths since the liberation of Baghdad are in the thousands.
[00:54:22.336 --> 00:54:29.317]  It says that our troops, this is admitted now, if you protest and they think someone, quote, might have a gun, they just mow the crowd down.
[00:54:29.618 --> 00:54:32.598]  It's Tiananmen Square every day in Iraq!
[00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:37.959]  We're so good, folks.
[00:54:38.159 --> 00:54:40.380]  I can't believe how good we are.
[00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:42.871]  Again, we're not part of this.
[00:54:42.891 --> 00:54:43.671]  This is sick.
[00:54:43.811 --> 00:54:44.972]  This is so sick.
[00:54:45.432 --> 00:54:59.201]  We'll come back and talk to Charlie and Phyllis, Phillip, excuse me, and Laura and others, and then we'll get Christopher Coleca on the show, where I've got the headline right here.
[00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:03.804]  Homeschooling under new law to be abuse in California.
[00:55:03.824 --> 00:55:06.066]  It just says, period, you homeschool, it's abusive.
[00:55:07.543 --> 00:55:09.945]  Yes, it's the new America, folks.
[00:55:10.126 --> 00:55:11.347]  This is who they're coming after.
[00:55:11.447 --> 00:55:13.008]  Hope you know the terrorism manual.
[00:55:13.028 --> 00:55:14.970]  Say, Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers.
[00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:15.571]  Word for word.
[00:55:16.511 --> 00:55:19.433]  And you thought it was the Muslims?
[00:55:19.493 --> 00:55:20.874]  Oh no, they work for the CIA.
[00:55:20.954 --> 00:55:26.639]  Any real Muslim terrorist is flying around in a plane with bars of gold from your tax money.
[00:55:26.679 --> 00:55:27.639]  I just want you to know that.
[00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:40.449]  By the way, Senate Reports, before I end this segment, you want to find out about those Muslim terrorists that work for the CIA, get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror, or my book, The Sentinel to Tyranny.
[00:55:41.073 --> 00:55:42.834]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:55:43.174 --> 00:55:44.615]  Help us get this story out.
[00:55:44.875 --> 00:55:46.776]  Help us expose the real terrorist star.
[00:55:47.196 --> 00:55:48.036]  Call toll free.

[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.261]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:56.821 --> 00:56:00.262]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:56:00.783 --> 00:56:01.523]  Get the word out.
[00:56:01.783 --> 00:56:03.484]  We've got to tell people who the terrorists are.
[00:56:03.664 --> 00:56:05.345]  They're going to keep posing as our saviors.
[00:56:05.365 --> 00:56:05.425]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:07.807 --> 00:56:14.630]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 or infowards.com or net.
[00:56:15.651 --> 00:56:16.271]  Don't wait.
[00:56:16.871 --> 00:56:17.631]  Get the video.
[00:56:17.651 --> 00:56:18.272]  Spread the word.
[00:56:18.332 --> 00:56:19.172]  Expose the terrorists.
[00:56:19.192 --> 00:56:19.872]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:21.373 --> 00:56:23.174]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:56:23.354 --> 00:56:23.954]  I mean real.
[00:56:24.134 --> 00:56:28.997]  Hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:30.157]  Probably never, right?
[00:56:30.437 --> 00:56:31.898]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here.
[00:56:35.026 --> 00:56:38.210]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:47.450]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.111 --> 00:56:49.191]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.892 --> 00:56:50.992]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.652 --> 00:56:52.473]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.213 --> 00:56:54.114]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.794 --> 00:56:58.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.976 --> 00:57:03.078]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:03.298 --> 00:57:14.564]  The government wants us to be mindless, spineless, drugged, hasty-skinned drones.
[00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:18.251]  By pasty skin.
[00:57:18.932 --> 00:57:20.393]  You know, like DHS 1138.
[00:57:21.054 --> 00:57:28.781]  Like underground dwellers with shaved heads who don't even know how to do anything aggressive to resist.
[00:57:28.921 --> 00:57:33.405]  Trained gerbils for a pet snake to be fed on.
[00:57:34.026 --> 00:57:37.429]  Banning dodgeball, banning musical chairs, all violent.
[00:57:37.449 --> 00:57:39.952]  You're arrested if you jump in a puddle of water at school.
[00:57:39.992 --> 00:57:41.253]  They say that's aggressive and hateful.
[00:57:42.216 --> 00:57:51.419]  Banning homeschooling, saying it's abuse, trying to deny homeschoolers their awards when they win incredibly complex science fair projects.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.740]  You know, just basic evil.
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.722]  Christopher Kalicka is coming on to talk about this in the next segment.
[00:57:57.762 --> 00:57:59.842]  Right now, let's go to Charlie in Pennsylvania.
[00:58:00.163 --> 00:58:02.563]  You're on the air, then Phillip and Laura and others.
[00:58:03.004 --> 00:58:03.904]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:58:04.798 --> 00:58:06.739]  Yeah, Alex, total control.
[00:58:06.759 --> 00:58:13.380]  They want to make it illegal to defend yourself because they may figure in the future that you might decide to defend against them.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:16.641]  Yeah, that's a criminal class looking out for the other criminals.
[00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:20.602]  For those that don't know, I just read the headline, government lawyers say burglars need protection.
[00:58:20.642 --> 00:58:25.723]  Headline that says, must stop violent householders from defending themselves.
[00:58:25.743 --> 00:58:26.083]  Go ahead.
[00:58:26.324 --> 00:58:26.804]  Incredible.
[00:58:27.024 --> 00:58:31.385]  Hey, I just talked to Carl Limbacher from Newsmax about 45 minutes ago.
[00:58:32.688 --> 00:58:46.973]  And I asked him, did he hear anything about this KGB general that they hired for Homeland Security, or did he hear anything about the CIA and the Pentagon being allowed to, you know, snoop into our lives?
[00:58:47.293 --> 00:58:50.234]  He said he'd never heard anything about either one of those things.
[00:58:50.294 --> 00:58:50.914]  Oh, that's funny.
[00:58:50.954 --> 00:58:55.536]  I've seen about, on those two subjects, 20 AP articles alone.
[00:58:55.576 --> 00:58:56.696]  I mean, it's been all over the news.
[00:58:56.996 --> 00:59:00.157]  My new film's probably got those articles in it 15 times.
[00:59:00.397 --> 00:59:02.258]  Would you say he was lying, Mr. Jones?
[00:59:03.012 --> 00:59:06.295]  I'm not going to say that, but I mean, everybody's gone neocon.
[00:59:06.775 --> 00:59:10.198]  It's, you know, it's George Bush is a conservative no matter how many guns he grabs.
[00:59:10.218 --> 00:59:10.838]  Let's put it another way.
[00:59:10.939 --> 00:59:15.062]  What do you think the possibility is that he doesn't have that information and doesn't know it?
[00:59:16.215 --> 00:59:17.055]  Let's just put it like that.
[00:59:17.075 --> 00:59:17.815]  That's ridiculous.
[00:59:17.855 --> 00:59:19.016]  It's been all over the news.
[00:59:19.036 --> 00:59:24.837]  It was in the Houston Chronicle and ten other Texas papers that I read that the CIA will quote, kill citizens.
[00:59:24.877 --> 00:59:25.597]  That was everywhere.
[00:59:25.617 --> 00:59:31.578]  It was all over UPI, AP, Reuters, that the Mossad is going to come here and kill American citizens.
[00:59:31.638 --> 00:59:32.258]  No trial.
[00:59:32.278 --> 00:59:33.979]  I mean, that's been all over the news.
[00:59:34.279 --> 00:59:36.079]  Did you have that on your website?
[00:59:36.479 --> 00:59:38.960]  Yeah, we've posted it many times when a new article comes out.
[00:59:40.258 --> 00:59:40.939]  It's everywhere!
[00:59:41.019 --> 00:59:46.062]  Well, this CIA and Pentagon thing, this was just recently, and I understand that the, was it fired?
[00:59:46.082 --> 01:00:01.753]  No, no, look, the main page of Infowars.com, Friday, had a fist with the Pentagon and the CIA, and it says, more power, and it's the New York Times saying that they're doing all this, so I don't know what this guy's talking about.
[01:00:01.773 --> 01:00:05.756]  I'll download this tomorrow and fax it to this station and to this guy up there.
[01:00:06.332 --> 01:00:08.133]  He's on here every Monday.
[01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:10.593]  Every time he comes on here, I'm going to ask him questions like this.
[01:00:10.613 --> 01:00:11.413]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:13.254]  Appreciate it.
[01:00:13.434 --> 01:00:16.815]  Phillip, where are you calling from, Phillip?
[01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:18.035]  I'm in Virginia, Alex.
[01:00:18.095 --> 01:00:18.295]  Thank you.
[01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:18.735]  Welcome, sir.
[01:00:18.995 --> 01:00:19.976]  Yeah, thank you very much.
[01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:21.956]  I'm glad to hear you're on the air.
[01:00:22.016 --> 01:00:23.656]  I was worried about you the other day.
[01:00:23.696 --> 01:00:26.197]  I thought you might have been sick or something, but I hope you got recharged.
[01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:26.977]  No, I didn't take off.
[01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:27.837]  I took off, though.
[01:00:28.398 --> 01:00:29.678]  Yeah, well deserved.
[01:00:30.632 --> 01:00:37.034]  Well, no, I've really been working on the new film and some other stuff, so I didn't take off from work, I just took off Friday.
[01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:42.896]  I mean, I want everybody to have their celebration, seeing Bush in a military outfit, like Kim Jong-il or something.
[01:00:44.397 --> 01:00:44.917]  Pathetic.
[01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:47.438]  Absolutely pathetic.
[01:00:47.538 --> 01:00:59.862]  And I'm sitting here listening to you talking about the demonization of homeschoolers, t-shirts with the word misspelled, and I'll tell you what, I am so
[01:01:00.598 --> 01:01:01.639]  Mad right now.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.724]  What these people are doing, and they think that they're going to get over on us.
[01:01:07.265 --> 01:01:08.706]  They got another thought coming.
[01:01:09.287 --> 01:01:16.354]  And like you did on your rebroadcast Friday, that one fella that read the story about Mother, the old lady.
[01:01:16.815 --> 01:01:19.497]  Yeah, taking on the British forces.
[01:01:20.378 --> 01:01:20.959]  Absolutely.
[01:01:20.979 --> 01:01:22.741]  Tell you what, you want to talk about homeschooling.
[01:01:23.456 --> 01:01:24.817]  Phillip, I didn't give you enough time.
[01:01:24.857 --> 01:01:25.437]  Just stay there.
[01:01:25.497 --> 01:01:26.318]  Our guest is coming on.
[01:01:26.358 --> 01:01:27.018]  You can talk to him.
[01:01:27.038 --> 01:01:30.400]  Then we'll go to Laura real quick, too, in Alabama.
[01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.021]  Stay there, Phillip.
[01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:33.702]  I'll let you talk to our guest about it.
[01:01:34.523 --> 01:01:37.344]  Yeah, they're going after us, the good people, the producers.
[01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:39.085]  They protect the criminals.
[01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:39.706]  That's their babies.
[01:01:42.353 --> 01:01:45.114]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:51.657]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[01:01:51.957 --> 01:01:57.840]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:02.022]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax exempt?
[01:02:02.759 --> 01:02:04.300]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.400]  Well, there is a way.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.802]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[01:02:12.142 --> 01:02:22.425]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[01:02:22.465 --> 01:02:23.286]  Constitution.
[01:02:23.546 --> 01:02:25.186]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[01:02:25.446 --> 01:02:27.747]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:35.919]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.646]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:02:42.228 --> 01:02:42.768]  Hey, folks!
[01:02:42.869 --> 01:02:49.073]  Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:02:49.393 --> 01:02:50.754]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:02:50.954 --> 01:02:53.155]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:55.397]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:02:55.677 --> 01:03:00.620]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:05.003]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:07.005]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:03:07.105 --> 01:03:12.088]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control,
[01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:12.768]  I think so.
[01:03:41.798 --> 01:03:45.261]  What if you could actually save money on everything you ever needed to buy?

[01:04:43.573 --> 01:04:49.596]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.217 --> 01:04:53.199]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:10.093]  We're joined by Christopher Flicka, and he's the Director of State and International Relations, Senior Counsel and Staff Attorney for the Home School Legal Defense Association.
[01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:22.135]  And Lord Bush, the neocon, has radically expanded the Department of Education way beyond Bill Clinton's wildest dreams.
[01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:36.918]  And all over the country cesspools like California run by socialists and gun-grabbing creatures like Davis are first saying, oh, we're going to arrest you and give you homeschool if you don't have a teaching certificate.
[01:05:37.138 --> 01:05:38.459]  Not a law, they just say it.
[01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:39.720]  Same thing in Illinois.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.961]  They're trying it all over now, even some southern states.
[01:05:42.801 --> 01:05:43.861]  It's all about intimidation.
[01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:44.502]  It's less than 1%.
[01:05:44.902 --> 01:05:46.883]  It's to scare you than to be highly publicized.
[01:05:46.903 --> 01:05:51.825]  We've talked to Christopher before and he's given us this great analysis and I agree with him.
[01:05:51.845 --> 01:05:52.525]  It's what they're doing.
[01:05:54.259 --> 01:06:16.009]  Now though they're trying to put it into law and call it child abuse, where they just refuse the school, refuse to give you quote your form, then you don't put your child in their abusive system where your child learns how to be a crack whore, or learns how to worship world government, or learns how to report mommy and daddy for owning guns, or where Christianity is seen as a cult religion but they teach you how to be a Muslim, I mean it goes on and on.
[01:06:16.429 --> 01:06:23.552]  The nightmares in these schools where your kid gets arrested if they're caught playing tag or dodgeball, they're training your kids how to be prisoners basically.
[01:06:24.369 --> 01:06:29.412]  And he joins us now to talk about this new horrible trend with this lob.
[01:06:30.813 --> 01:06:32.294]  Well, these disgusting creatures.
[01:06:32.635 --> 01:06:34.776]  I'm sorry, I'm angry about these people.
[01:06:34.816 --> 01:06:39.599]  They don't want your kids fleeing because more people are now in an exodus out of the schools.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.824]  They're even trying to take over the private schools now, so one of the few places to run is the homeschooling.
[01:06:47.945 --> 01:06:52.448]  And they're winning all the spelling bees, this little 13-year-old, as I said,
[01:06:54.136 --> 01:07:02.363]  Taiwanese child, he's an American but he's Taiwanese, background, wins the big Intel science test.
[01:07:02.403 --> 01:07:04.664]  They try to disprove that he could do this DNA sequencing.
[01:07:04.744 --> 01:07:06.286]  He found out he was even smarter than that.
[01:07:06.706 --> 01:07:07.607]  He wins the award.
[01:07:07.647 --> 01:07:08.627]  They want to ban that.
[01:07:08.908 --> 01:07:09.408]  They're mad.
[01:07:09.448 --> 01:07:11.330]  They can't ruin your kids and put them on Ritalin.
[01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:12.511]  Joining us,
[01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.985]  Chris Clack, thank you for coming on the show, sir.
[01:07:16.445 --> 01:07:17.705]  Oh, thanks so much for having me.
[01:07:18.105 --> 01:07:25.467]  Is that basically kind of a good summation of what they want from last time you were on, or tell us what this is all about in this latest case, Chris.
[01:07:25.927 --> 01:07:26.347]  Okay.
[01:07:27.527 --> 01:07:38.970]  You're right, definitely, that there is a movement of the child rights advocates that are using many different angles to try to control our children.
[01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.851]  They try to control our children through the public schools,
[01:07:42.543 --> 01:07:48.326]  And there's no doubt about that, that it's a mass production system, mass manipulation.
[01:07:49.286 --> 01:08:09.456]  That's why the homeschool movement I'm so thankful for, that we've won the right to do this homeschooling so that we can remove our children from the clutches of those who would like to control and reshape our children away from our traditional moral Judeo-Christian values that our country was founded on.
[01:08:10.012 --> 01:08:16.976]  And one of the big areas is through the social service system, the Child Protective Workers.
[01:08:16.996 --> 01:08:21.078]  And that's what you had in California with this Senate Bill 950.
[01:08:21.338 --> 01:08:31.544]  It was an attempt to remove truancy from its place right now, which is
[01:08:32.145 --> 01:08:32.786]  I don't know.
[01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:04.684]  I mean, it's crazy what they're doing.
[01:09:04.704 --> 01:09:11.627]  I'm sure you heard about Florida, where convicted pedophiles were actually running the Department of Child Services.
[01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:17.529]  The main database controller was, and about a third of the top people were all convicted pedophiles.
[01:09:17.549 --> 01:09:18.190]  Did you hear about that?
[01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.590]  Oh, yes.
[01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:20.831]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:20.851 --> 01:09:21.471]  It's incredible.
[01:09:21.831 --> 01:09:24.932]  And these are the people who are supposed to be protecting the children.
[01:09:25.733 --> 01:09:30.955]  We have at Homeschool Legal Defense Association at least one family a day
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:36.011]  Who gets turned into social services of no fault of their own.
[01:09:36.031 --> 01:09:40.352]  These are anonymous tipsters that call the child abuse hotlines.
[01:09:40.372 --> 01:09:42.213]  You can do this in any of the 50 states.
[01:09:42.713 --> 01:09:53.335]  You can make up a story because you don't like the family because they're homeschooling, you're prejudiced against them because they're Christian, or you know, whatever, whatever the issue is personally, you can make up a story.
[01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:56.896]  Say there's bruises on the child, even though there isn't any, or
[01:09:57.372 --> 01:10:01.433]  Well, you don't have to do it, and the key is don't answer the door and don't talk to them.
[01:10:01.453 --> 01:10:03.354]  But continuing, this is all part of the larger federal plan.
[01:10:17.196 --> 01:10:20.979]  I know you've talked to Charlotte Iserby, who was the number two person at the Department of Education.
[01:10:21.399 --> 01:10:22.820]  This was their plan all along.
[01:10:23.341 --> 01:10:26.823]  It doesn't matter who's in office in the White House, it just gets worse and worse.
[01:10:27.203 --> 01:10:31.867]  There is a backlash against all of this, though, especially as the horrors are revealed.
[01:10:31.907 --> 01:10:38.732]  But to make this now... Like, here in Austin, Texas, if you're late to class three times, that's considered truancy.
[01:10:39.212 --> 01:10:40.513]  They criminally charge you.
[01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:42.875]  In one school, over half the kids have been charged.
[01:10:43.602 --> 01:10:49.087]  Though the state law says 12 to 14 truancies in a semester, they're not even following the law anymore.
[01:10:49.207 --> 01:10:58.857]  I met a lady, she showed me the documents, and she actually works for someone in my family, and she brought, she showed me the documentation.
[01:10:59.377 --> 01:11:05.463]  Her child was in kindergarten six years ago and was out for a week with pneumonia.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.384]  They have now criminally charged her for truancy in kindergarten.
[01:11:10.804 --> 01:11:12.445]  And we went and looked at the statute of limitations.
[01:11:13.126 --> 01:11:15.468]  It's like six months, because there's not even a criminal charge.
[01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:17.550]  And they're now criminally charging her.
[01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:19.312]  They're not even following laws now, sir.
[01:11:19.332 --> 01:11:23.315]  I mean, it's just la-la land, so we can see where this is going.
[01:11:23.856 --> 01:11:27.319]  Well, that's why there is a Homeschool Legal Offense Association.
[01:11:27.339 --> 01:11:30.762]  That's why we got 76,000 families that are members, because
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.483]  They realize that the war isn't over.
[01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:54.419]  The war is, we're engaged in it, and the war is for our children's lives, our children's minds, and those who oppose us, those who are anti-parent and the pro-child forces, and I don't mean that in a positive way, they're trying to take our children through whatever means they can.
[01:11:54.439 --> 01:11:59.604]  Well, let's face it, there's also a big move to take people's children to give it to homosexuals.
[01:12:00.376 --> 01:12:00.796]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:00.976 --> 01:12:08.361]  And that's a huge, that was on the front page of the paper this week how wonderful it is how they take people's children and give them to these people.
[01:12:08.861 --> 01:12:10.402]  You know, it's crazy.
[01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:11.863]  It really is nuts.
[01:12:12.163 --> 01:12:16.186]  Believe it or not, there is a little bit of good news even from the federal level.
[01:12:16.226 --> 01:12:26.632]  I had an opportunity to testify before Congress last year in regards to this mega bill called the Child Protection and Treatment Act.
[01:12:27.368 --> 01:12:31.370]  Uh, that you have, uh, it's called CAPTA in the, in the federal government.
[01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:32.810]  They pass it every five years.
[01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:33.831]  It's a reauthorization.
[01:12:33.911 --> 01:12:37.412]  Anyhow, I was able to testify and I offered five amendments.
[01:12:37.952 --> 01:12:42.534]  They accepted two of them and now this is about to become the law of the land.
[01:12:42.574 --> 01:12:50.818]  And one amendment requires all 50 states, the social workers, to tell you what the allegations are when they come to your door.
[01:12:51.258 --> 01:12:53.879]  No longer can they hold, withhold that from you.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.423]  But they have to tell you what you're being accused of.
[01:12:56.463 --> 01:12:58.986]  It's basic stuff, but we had to put it in general law.
[01:12:59.006 --> 01:13:01.229]  Well I think that's a major victory, but let's be honest.
[01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:04.894]  These people are so criminal in the studies we've done.
[01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:08.578]  I mean, sir, there was a case where this woman was poor.
[01:13:10.481 --> 01:13:12.784]  If you go to the city to have your kid at their city hospital,
[01:13:13.504 --> 01:13:16.106]  They come in, they grab your kid, and we've read the documents.
[01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:17.187]  It'll be a newborn baby.
[01:13:17.467 --> 01:13:22.190]  They'll say, one year ago, the mother was seen abusing the child by witnesses.
[01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:24.892]  The baby didn't even exist in her womb a year before.
[01:13:25.352 --> 01:13:26.833]  Just crazy lies!
[01:13:26.853 --> 01:13:29.975]  I mean, it's... They just write anything, sir.
[01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:34.018]  Oh, I've found so many times where the social workers have lied.
[01:13:34.038 --> 01:13:35.900]  They've lied to judges, even.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:42.184]  I've gotten copies of affidavits that they gave to judges in order to get corridors to get into people's homes to take their kids.
[01:13:42.674 --> 01:13:45.656]  And upon reviewing those affidavits, we find out they lied.
[01:13:47.617 --> 01:13:54.640]  It seems that a lot of social workers don't have kids and they take it personally when somebody doesn't cooperate with them.
[01:13:55.221 --> 01:13:58.162]  And they just forget that there's a Fourth Amendment.
[01:13:58.182 --> 01:14:00.523]  They forget or never have been trained.
[01:14:00.563 --> 01:14:01.704]  Well, let's face it.
[01:14:01.864 --> 01:14:02.984]  Now they want to privatize.
[01:14:03.004 --> 01:14:03.805]  Have you heard about that?
[01:14:04.657 --> 01:14:05.959]  No, I haven't heard of that.
[01:14:24.318 --> 01:14:41.910]  Just give the social services just tremendous power to go in the hospitals and meet new moms to determine if they are fit mothers to take those kids and start doing testing on them right away to see if they, you know, would have handicaps and all kind of, you know, if they were going to have trouble.
[01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:43.631]  Yeah, this is worse than the Soviet Union.
[01:14:43.752 --> 01:14:44.052]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:44.092 --> 01:14:46.133]  You go in, you have, that's how it already is here.
[01:14:46.674 --> 01:14:48.175]  They're stalking the hospitals.
[01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:50.016]  They've got plants in there that get a cut.
[01:14:50.712 --> 01:14:52.913]  And if people look ignorant, man, their kid's gone.
[01:14:53.273 --> 01:14:53.793]  That's right.
[01:14:53.813 --> 01:14:55.854]  I mean, if you look ignorant, man, it's over.
[01:14:55.874 --> 01:14:57.074]  They walk in and go, please sign here.
[01:14:57.094 --> 01:14:57.755]  Well, what are you doing?
[01:14:58.175 --> 01:14:59.035]  Just work with us, sir.
[01:14:59.055 --> 01:14:59.795]  Everything will be all right.
[01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.836]  You sign it, they grab your kid and go, ha, ha, ha.
[01:15:01.856 --> 01:15:02.536]  I mean, literally.
[01:15:02.936 --> 01:15:03.176]  Uh-huh.
[01:15:03.857 --> 01:15:07.558]  And one other... Suppose they don't yell, hail Satan or something and jump on a broomstick.
[01:15:07.858 --> 01:15:09.439]  Yeah, it's very sad.
[01:15:09.499 --> 01:15:18.882]  And one other positive development on that CAFTA bill I was telling you about was another law, another part of the law that's going to be a requirement in all 50 states is that
[01:15:19.509 --> 01:15:26.952]  All social workers will have to be trained in their duty to protect those they investigate.
[01:15:26.992 --> 01:15:30.394]  They have to protect their constitutional and statutory rights.
[01:15:30.874 --> 01:15:32.475]  And we've been asked, H.S.
[01:15:32.655 --> 01:15:37.457]  Homeschool Legal Defense Association, we've been asked to help write the manual that will train these people.
[01:15:37.497 --> 01:15:41.319]  So we hold a little bit of hope, not a lot, but a little bit of hope that
[01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:45.648]  At least we're going to have some inroads now and maybe turn the tide.
[01:15:57.173 --> 01:16:01.558]  Basically, it's Planned Parenthood 2 is what the social services groups are in your area.
[01:16:01.818 --> 01:16:07.525]  If they can't kill them in the womb, they're going to try to get them and drug them and screw them up out of the womb in their death mills.
[01:16:07.785 --> 01:16:11.449]  These are big psychiatric facilities full of toddlers hopped up on drugs.
[01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:12.991]  Were you aware they were doing that?
[01:16:13.798 --> 01:16:15.039]  Oh yeah, they'll do that.
[01:16:15.079 --> 01:16:15.839]  They'll put them on Ritalin.
[01:16:15.859 --> 01:16:18.280]  They'll do whatever they can to control the kids.
[01:16:18.621 --> 01:16:19.721]  Well, they get more federal funding.
[01:16:19.821 --> 01:16:21.842]  One more segment with us, because those are great victories.
[01:16:21.862 --> 01:16:23.023]  We've got a few calls here for you.
[01:16:23.323 --> 01:16:27.625]  I want to talk about what's going to happen with this bill in California, or how to defeat that, or have you defeated that.
[01:16:27.705 --> 01:16:31.047]  I want folks to know how evil, how evil this is.
[01:16:31.107 --> 01:16:32.428]  And it all comes from the federal government.
[01:16:33.148 --> 01:16:36.950]  That's where the training comes down to the states, and they're coming after you.
[01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.971]  Imagine, every time you have a kid, the government's there.
[01:16:39.912 --> 01:16:40.392]  Be right back.
[01:16:42.273 --> 01:16:46.536]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:51.520]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:16:51.901 --> 01:16:56.764]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.926]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:58.966 --> 01:16:59.967]  can barely be read.
[01:16:59.987 --> 01:17:01.248]  It is faded that much.
[01:17:01.588 --> 01:17:05.491]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[01:19:41.787 --> 01:19:45.452]  Still waiting for that shark or whale to stroll into the doctor's office for an annual checkup?
[01:19:45.793 --> 01:19:50.739]  Well, you'll be waiting a long time because, like all ocean fish and mammals, they live a virtually disease-free life.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:51.400]  Why?
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.602]  The answer's simple.
[01:19:52.942 --> 01:19:56.246]  They live in the ocean, rich with minerals, and on land, we're not so lucky.
[01:19:56.727 --> 01:19:57.808]  What's all this mean to you?
[01:19:58.128 --> 01:20:03.934]  Two-time Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling said, all sickness and disease can be traced to a lack of minerals in our diet.
[01:20:04.274 --> 01:20:08.258]  This lack of minerals could be directly responsible for your lack of energy or ill health.
[01:20:08.618 --> 01:20:12.202]  If you're sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, you need to try sea minerals.

[01:20:47.268 --> 01:20:49.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:49.649 --> 01:20:52.470]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:52.490 --> 01:21:03.214]  I'm talking to Chris Flicka and he's the Senior Counsel and Staff Attorney Director of State and International Relations for the Homeschool Legal Defense Association.
[01:21:05.455 --> 01:21:08.036]  Chris, so what's going to happen with this bill out in California?
[01:21:08.076 --> 01:21:09.576]  Are you guys going to be able to defeat it?
[01:21:11.217 --> 01:21:12.117]  What's developing there?
[01:21:15.564 --> 01:21:18.245]  I have good news to report on this front as well.
[01:21:18.325 --> 01:21:34.769]  The Senate Bill 950 that would have taken the jurisdiction of the authorities over truancy from the criminal courts to the juvenile courts and to the social service department has been defeated.
[01:21:35.289 --> 01:21:42.531]  And we really are thankful because this would have, essentially this kind of scenario would have happened that
[01:21:43.118 --> 01:21:57.569]  If a child missed five days of school, they'd be determined to be habitual truant, just five days of school, and then they'd be turned over to social services for a full-scale investigation and determination of whether these children should be removed.
[01:21:57.589 --> 01:21:59.371]  And understand, these people have bounties.
[01:21:59.411 --> 01:22:01.752]  That's how they get paid, is for seizing your kid.
[01:22:01.772 --> 01:22:03.294]  That's exactly right.
[01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:11.560]  And we were able to convince key senators on the committee who control the life and death of this bill that this was a far
[01:22:12.353 --> 01:22:15.895]  Uh, way overreaching and it would violate constitutional rights.
[01:22:15.975 --> 01:22:17.036]  Now, what was this about?
[01:22:17.076 --> 01:22:19.377]  Thousands of phone calls came in from the homeschoolers.
[01:22:19.537 --> 01:22:20.738]  Well, that's great.
[01:22:20.818 --> 01:22:21.338]  I commend you.
[01:22:21.358 --> 01:22:22.459]  But what about Florida?
[01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:29.863]  I didn't know they were going to have that nanny bill where everybody gets a visit, a snatch visit, right at birth.
[01:22:29.963 --> 01:22:30.583]  That's amazing.
[01:22:30.983 --> 01:22:33.725]  Oh, the good news on that one too is that it was
[01:22:34.701 --> 01:23:02.928]  The bad news was it was passed by the House and passed, actually it was defeated by the House, went to the Senate last year, then the Senate last second did a substitute for the House, the House thought they were voting on something else, they ended up voting for this government nanny bill, so then it went to the Governor, but in the process they attached, this shows you how sneaky sometimes legislatures are, they attached an economic package that Jeb Bush had initiated, they attached it to the government nanny bill,
[01:23:04.086 --> 01:23:07.427]  Governor Bush couldn't veto his own economic package.
[01:23:07.467 --> 01:23:09.428]  No, he had to sign a non-member, yes.
[01:23:09.808 --> 01:23:21.133]  And the good news was that we were able to convince Jeb Bush to use his line item veto on the budget, so we have a government nanny bill in Florida without any money, so it hasn't been implemented.
[01:23:21.933 --> 01:23:25.657]  It's not over until it's over.
[01:23:25.677 --> 01:23:26.859]  The law is there now.
[01:23:27.339 --> 01:23:29.742]  The law is there, but there's no money to implement it.
[01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:31.363]  Unbelievable.
[01:23:31.383 --> 01:23:33.786]  That's still nightmarish.
[01:23:34.266 --> 01:23:41.374]  Imagine being there with your wife, you just had a child, and here comes walking in the satanic bureaucrat.
[01:23:43.064 --> 01:23:46.606]  And these people have a whole different philosophy, a whole different belief system.
[01:23:46.926 --> 01:23:48.307]  Oh, I went to college with some of them.
[01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:49.827]  I mean, these are family haters.
[01:23:50.268 --> 01:23:51.568]  Usually they were abused.
[01:23:51.828 --> 01:23:55.650]  It's like a crazy person who thinks everybody else, you know, is their mommy or something.
[01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:56.431]  Yeah.
[01:23:56.511 --> 01:23:57.371]  Oh, you did it to me.
[01:23:57.451 --> 01:23:58.372]  I'm going to get you.
[01:23:58.392 --> 01:23:59.912]  I mean, these are like mentally ill people.
[01:24:00.893 --> 01:24:03.374]  I saw it at college and I'd always, what are you majoring in?
[01:24:03.394 --> 01:24:04.995]  Oh, I'm going to be a social service worker.
[01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:06.096]  TPS.
[01:24:06.216 --> 01:24:06.916]  Oh.
[01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:07.616]  Yep.
[01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:10.938]  And I was in a class here in Virginia.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:17.762]  Where Homeschool Legal Defense Association is based, four lawyers on how they could become guardian ad litem.
[01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:22.624]  These are court-appointed lawyers for children in child welfare cases.
[01:24:23.204 --> 01:24:38.870]  And during the session, while we were being trained, this is a seven-hour session, lawyers from all over the state, and they had a social worker come and explain what the typical abusive family looked like.
[01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:40.731]  And she gave three scenarios.
[01:24:41.164 --> 01:24:59.567]  The first scenario was a family who were religious, that they went to church, that they used scripture to control children, and they believed that the father was the head of the house.
[01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:03.342]  That was a typical abusive family.
[01:25:03.502 --> 01:25:05.224]  They have white picket fences.
[01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:07.305]  Isn't that unbelievable?
[01:25:07.706 --> 01:25:15.092]  I saw a FEMA report where they list homeschoolers, gun owners, Christians, and they say these people may wear suits.
[01:25:15.173 --> 01:25:16.394]  They may speak well.
[01:25:16.954 --> 01:25:17.875]  Very dangerous.
[01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:18.556]  Watch them.
[01:25:18.716 --> 01:25:19.136]  Go ahead.
[01:25:19.516 --> 01:25:20.017]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:20.097 --> 01:25:25.182]  And then that second category for them was they call it the rigid family.
[01:25:25.202 --> 01:25:26.723]  The family has a lot of rules.
[01:25:27.079 --> 01:25:31.622]  You know, they enforce those rules, you know, they're very strict, and all this kind of thing.
[01:25:31.642 --> 01:25:35.065]  I mean, they don't let their 13-year-old daughter go out the front door with a gang member?
[01:25:35.265 --> 01:25:37.106]  That's right, that's right, that's too strict.
[01:25:37.126 --> 01:25:39.508]  You gotta let the children do what they feel like, see?
[01:25:40.148 --> 01:25:46.733]  And the last category was the only one that was realistic, was, you know, if it was a drug-using family, etc.
[01:25:47.133 --> 01:25:54.038]  But the good news on that is we ended up communicating to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia that governed these classes.
[01:25:54.717 --> 01:26:05.365]  And, uh, you know, we gave them a veiled threat of a suit, uh, the discrimination here and stereotyping of these, um, of these people, and they pulled it.
[01:26:05.445 --> 01:26:06.646]  So... Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:26:07.146 --> 01:26:07.967]  I know you're busy.
[01:26:07.987 --> 01:26:09.008]  If you've got to go, that's fine.
[01:26:09.048 --> 01:26:10.409]  We've got a bunch of callers who want to talk to you.
[01:26:10.429 --> 01:26:11.390]  You want to go or stay?
[01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:12.170]  I'll stay.
[01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:13.011]  Okay, great.
[01:26:13.151 --> 01:26:17.954]  I promise we'll go to Phillip and, uh, Laura and Pat and John and everybody else.
[01:26:18.135 --> 01:26:20.476]  I promise when we get back, directly to your calls.
[01:26:20.496 --> 01:26:21.857]  Folks, we're not exaggerating.
[01:26:21.917 --> 01:26:23.839]  It's worse than what Chris is saying, okay?
[01:26:24.657 --> 01:26:25.178]  Believe me.
[01:26:25.819 --> 01:26:26.259]  We've gone.
[01:26:26.299 --> 01:26:28.162]  We've got TV shows and radio shows about this.
[01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.043]  We've got footage of this.
[01:26:29.283 --> 01:26:31.005]  These people are from the pit of hell.
[01:26:32.728 --> 01:26:33.649]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:35.712]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:39.356]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.819 --> 01:26:46.721]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:52.403]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[01:26:52.663 --> 01:26:53.544]  Ideal for... That's 877-605-9200.
[01:26:53.564 --> 01:26:54.204]  Call today.
[01:27:05.741 --> 01:27:25.745]  Alright, we're talking to the Senior Counsel and Staff Attorney Director of the State and International Relations for the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, and let me give you the website.
[01:27:25.805 --> 01:27:28.126]  It's HSLDA.org.
[01:27:28.146 --> 01:27:28.846]  HSLDA.org.
[01:27:33.951 --> 01:27:37.814]  I guess the acronym or the abbreviation for Homeschool Legal Defense Association.
[01:27:38.274 --> 01:27:41.737]  And I'm sorry folks, you know, God designed me as a good mammal.
[01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:46.380]  And I guess in our group of species, we like to defend our young.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.301]  I think most species do this.
[01:27:48.421 --> 01:27:54.005]  And when you find out that pedophile rings actually, and this is in many states.
[01:27:54.065 --> 01:27:55.466]  I read mainstream news on this show.
[01:27:55.727 --> 01:27:57.508]  We posted hundreds of articles about this.
[01:27:58.089 --> 01:28:04.912]  They run these systems, they got weird socialists, devil worshippers, occultists... I'm not kidding!
[01:28:04.932 --> 01:28:05.752]  And they've been caught!
[01:28:06.512 --> 01:28:08.293]  Five times more likely to be abused.
[01:28:09.734 --> 01:28:25.420]  Some of these people that are the foster parents... I mean, these aren't the foster parents of the olden days where, you know, they're good Christians and they love children and they adopt 10 kids and do it on their own money and the dad works, you know, 20 hours a day.
[01:28:26.309 --> 01:28:32.132]  No, we're talking about people where they'll have like eight kids in a mill and they starve them to death and beat them and torture them.
[01:28:32.693 --> 01:28:36.995]  They can basically barbecue kids on the front lawn on a spit and nothing happens to them.
[01:28:37.676 --> 01:28:50.463]  But Christians, homeschoolers, we've read the articles where there's a family who's been raising kids for 20 years and you know two of them are in the military and moved out and they got some little ones and the neighbor said those kids ain't going to school and calls them and the
[01:28:51.525 --> 01:28:55.268]  DCF shows up and doesn't even know the kids' names and says, we heard about abuse.
[01:28:55.368 --> 01:28:56.830]  And the people go, well, wait a minute.
[01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:58.091]  We live in the middle of 100 acres.
[01:28:58.111 --> 01:28:59.672]  No one can even see our property.
[01:28:59.952 --> 01:29:00.673]  We don't care!
[01:29:00.733 --> 01:29:03.075]  Get them to us!
[01:29:03.095 --> 01:29:07.499]  We're going to go to these calls directly, but Chris, how do you counter it?
[01:29:07.779 --> 01:29:08.860]  How do you tell people to counter it?
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.041]  You've got a bunch of kids yourself.
[01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:11.282]  When somebody comes to the door and...
[01:29:12.463 --> 01:29:13.064]  Let me in.
[01:29:13.084 --> 01:29:15.245]  I just want to be friendly and see if your kid's alright.
[01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:19.488]  I mean, with the Fourth Amendment, you know, if the police came to my door and didn't have a warrant, I just wouldn't open it.
[01:29:21.009 --> 01:29:25.492]  How do you advise folks to handle this when these literal child kidnappers show up?
[01:29:26.513 --> 01:29:33.899]  Well, first of all, if they're homeschoolers, we urge them to join the homeschool legal defense and we'll be there for them to defend them literally at the door.
[01:29:33.919 --> 01:29:39.923]  I spend a lot of time talking to people on the phone and keep the social workers and the police out of people's homes, but
[01:29:40.645 --> 01:29:44.628]  In a nutshell, what one does is, first of all, you don't let them in the house.
[01:29:45.668 --> 01:29:47.769]  Number two, don't let them talk to your children.
[01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:58.776]  Number three, get their business card so you know who they are, so when you call Homeschool Legal Defense, if you haven't already gotten a hold of us on our hotline, which we have operational for 24 hours a day,
[01:29:59.515 --> 01:30:00.176]  I think so.
[01:30:10.945 --> 01:30:12.286]  I don't think so.
[01:30:34.355 --> 01:30:35.615]  I've never done one of these stories.
[01:30:35.635 --> 01:30:41.756]  We've probably only done five, but in five stories we've done, maybe it's seven stories we've done, we get the documents.
[01:30:42.297 --> 01:30:45.217]  These people are the biggest liars.
[01:30:45.377 --> 01:30:47.958]  I mean, they, and they think nothing about it.
[01:30:48.278 --> 01:30:49.258]  Have you seen that, Chris?
[01:30:49.598 --> 01:30:50.278]  Oh, definitely.
[01:30:50.438 --> 01:30:51.558]  We see a lot of lies.
[01:30:51.578 --> 01:31:01.060]  In fact, out of San Diego, the grand jury looked at the social service system a few years back, and they found that almost all the social workers
[01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:31.441]  uh... were lying or or changing facts in order to uh... make their case before the judge it was very disconcerting and and i'm i must say at this point that not all social workers are bad there's good people in there and there's real abuse going on obviously i'm going to be covering cases that are bad uh... you know that's the stuff but i mean frankly that all i see is bad oh yeah but at the same time there there is a disrespect for constitutional rights of those being investigated because
[01:31:32.695 --> 01:31:41.404]  70 to 90 percent of the allegations received by social workers, this is statistically across the country, turn out to be false.
[01:31:41.925 --> 01:31:47.431]  And so that means there's a lot of wheels that are spinning here, a lot of dollars are being spent
[01:31:47.984 --> 01:31:51.286]  Over just people using the system to get after other people.
[01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:51.766]  Well, that's it.
[01:31:51.846 --> 01:31:56.869]  It's a giant bureaucracy and am I right in saying, Chris, it's exploding in size?
[01:31:57.429 --> 01:31:57.769]  Oh, yes.
[01:31:58.650 --> 01:32:06.414]  If you are a legislator and you vote against a bill that's going to give more money to the social service system, you're going to be targeted as anti-child.
[01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:07.534]  You don't care about kids.
[01:32:09.456 --> 01:32:14.980]  It's a continuation of money flowing to... Chris, there's no need to demonize these people.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.861]  I don't need to demonize a cockroach.
[01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:19.023]  If I just turn the light on, they're demonized.
[01:32:19.343 --> 01:32:19.603]  That's right.
[01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:25.147]  We just gotta turn the light on, these people... I'm telling you, from the top, this system is totally un-American.
[01:32:25.167 --> 01:32:29.910]  You know, I read this about Russia, Germany, they do this in China, Cuba is big on this.
[01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:37.795]  I mean, I think it's important for people to demonize these social workers and the whole system, again, by just turning the light on,
[01:32:38.644 --> 01:32:43.588]  And to tell these horror stories, are you seeing a shift, though, to people waking up to this?
[01:32:43.648 --> 01:32:44.548]  I think I've been seeing that.
[01:32:44.929 --> 01:32:45.589]  Oh, definitely.
[01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:46.830]  People are waking up.
[01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:48.551]  People are standing up for their rights.
[01:32:49.212 --> 01:32:57.998]  When we started litigating this, where we would sue social workers for violating the constitutional rights, we were really the first doing it.
[01:32:58.018 --> 01:32:59.199]  There was no precedent.
[01:32:59.219 --> 01:33:01.120]  There was nobody standing up to social workers.
[01:33:01.521 --> 01:33:02.621]  Now there's more and more.
[01:33:02.661 --> 01:33:03.622]  Lawyers are standing up.
[01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:05.083]  More and more people are standing up.
[01:33:05.744 --> 01:33:07.585]  And we're seeing more good cases.
[01:33:08.421 --> 01:33:10.642]  Congress, as they said, they listened.
[01:33:10.762 --> 01:33:20.605]  I brought these horror stories to them when they testified last year, and they listened, and they put these two amendments on this big bill that's going to affect all 50 states.
[01:33:20.625 --> 01:33:24.286]  So we're making inroads, but we've got a long way to go, that's for sure.
[01:33:26.046 --> 01:33:26.606]  Absolutely.
[01:33:26.646 --> 01:33:27.467]  Let's take some calls.
[01:33:27.507 --> 01:33:34.569]  I really appreciate Phillip and Laura and Pat and John and others holding.
[01:33:34.589 --> 01:33:35.269]  You're on the air.
[01:33:36.461 --> 01:33:38.863]  Phillip in Virginia, go ahead.
[01:33:39.284 --> 01:33:41.425]  Greetings to your guests there, Chris.
[01:33:41.545 --> 01:33:44.528]  Tremendous work you're doing there along with men like Alex.
[01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:50.293]  You know, it's just infuriating to hear this type of stuff.
[01:33:50.933 --> 01:34:03.063]  And when people hear statements that these people are diabolic, they are of the devil, just listening to you talk about the guidelines when you went through your training,
[01:34:03.675 --> 01:34:04.696]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:34:04.876 --> 01:34:06.578]  I've covered them and been around them.
[01:34:06.638 --> 01:34:07.339]  This is a news program.
[01:34:26.784 --> 01:34:28.786]  When you're around them, they really are demonic.
[01:34:28.846 --> 01:34:33.490]  I mean, these are, at least what I've seen, these are degenerate scum.
[01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:34.470]  That's all I can say about them.
[01:34:35.791 --> 01:34:36.792]  Chris made a good point.
[01:34:36.852 --> 01:34:41.456]  Not all of them are like that, but most of them are because it's just a J-O-B to them.
[01:34:41.796 --> 01:34:42.417]  They don't care.
[01:34:42.437 --> 01:34:46.140]  Well, isn't there a big move now of former social workers?
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.603]  Because I know a lot of them are now quitting, can't handle it, and are speaking out.
[01:34:50.403 --> 01:34:52.025]  Oh, there's been some.
[01:34:52.065 --> 01:34:54.647]  I haven't heard of any organization exactly, but
[01:34:55.143 --> 01:34:57.044]  I've talked to them regularly on the phone.
[01:34:57.064 --> 01:35:03.087]  I've talked to one lady who's been in there for 30 years, and she said it's totally changed from when she started.
[01:35:03.107 --> 01:35:07.610]  They used to try to prove that when they got an allegation, they'd try to prove the family innocent.
[01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:15.194]  Now, when they get an allegation, they assume the family is guilty, and then they go about to prove that.
[01:35:15.294 --> 01:35:17.475]  So it's very topsy-turvy.
[01:35:17.555 --> 01:35:23.819]  Every other area of law enforcement, you're presumed innocent until they got evidence
[01:35:24.113 --> 01:35:25.454]  That's a good question.
[01:35:39.545 --> 01:35:41.465]  child that they can label as abuse.
[01:35:41.485 --> 01:35:43.146]  So it's a big incentive for them.
[01:35:43.286 --> 01:35:46.086]  Well, also, I mean, you talk about how they're changing the definitions.
[01:35:46.126 --> 01:35:49.667]  Now, if your kid misses five days of school, that is abuse.
[01:35:49.687 --> 01:35:51.827]  You know, they're trying to change that definition.
[01:35:52.147 --> 01:36:01.469]  But the big thing is you talked about how this law got passed in Florida, where at birth, I mean, imagine you just want family around with something like that.
[01:36:01.949 --> 01:36:06.370]  You don't want... Imagine one of these socialist
[01:36:07.677 --> 01:36:15.499]  Freaks with this horrible track record of abuse and evil, especially in Florida, knowing that convicted pedophiles run the agency.
[01:36:15.779 --> 01:36:18.299]  And that's Miami Herald, folks.
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:19.160]  AP.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:25.601]  I mean, to know that a potential pedophile is going to be visiting you, that is terrifying.
[01:36:27.122 --> 01:36:29.342]  Yeah, we've come a long, long way.
[01:36:30.662 --> 01:36:32.023]  We've got seven children.
[01:36:32.063 --> 01:36:33.483]  We had twins who were
[01:36:34.293 --> 01:37:01.623]  Uh... in difficulty and they almost died but uh... they were born alive and at the hospital they sick two social workers on us because we were an at-risk family because we had four little kids under six years old at home about an hour and a half away being watched by friends from our church and then here we were at the hospital we had one child in intensive care uh... one baby and then one baby that my wife... Let's make that clear
[01:37:02.842 --> 01:37:04.262]  Your wife gets diabetes.
[01:37:04.302 --> 01:37:05.303]  You've got four kids.
[01:37:05.343 --> 01:37:05.803]  They come.
[01:37:05.843 --> 01:37:06.683]  They take your kids.
[01:37:07.523 --> 01:37:09.444]  For those that don't know, it's called at-risk.
[01:37:10.304 --> 01:37:12.484]  And so imagine being at the hospital.
[01:37:12.524 --> 01:37:15.585]  You've already got your four other kids with family and friends.
[01:37:15.925 --> 01:37:16.445]  You're there.
[01:37:16.485 --> 01:37:18.026]  Your babies are hanging on for life.
[01:37:18.306 --> 01:37:26.888]  And literal creatures show up and are cornering you with their beady eyes
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.084]  What parent, frankly, what parent wouldn't probably flip out at that point?
[01:37:31.264 --> 01:37:31.945]  How did you handle it?
[01:37:31.965 --> 01:37:32.765]  What did they do to you, Chris?
[01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:37.931]  Oh, they came in the hospital room and they literally were terrorizing my wife.
[01:37:37.991 --> 01:37:38.952]  And she broke down.
[01:37:39.012 --> 01:37:41.334]  Of course, she had just gone through a C-section.
[01:37:41.374 --> 01:37:42.555]  She wasn't feeling well.
[01:37:43.236 --> 01:37:45.879]  And I ordered them out of the hospital room.
[01:37:45.919 --> 01:37:48.922]  Of course, you don't have the protection of your home in those instances.
[01:37:49.432 --> 01:37:50.833]  I ordered them out of the hospital room.
[01:37:50.873 --> 01:37:52.694]  I went and got one of the chief doctors.
[01:37:53.155 --> 01:37:54.516]  I laid it out before him.
[01:37:54.916 --> 01:38:03.142]  He called off one of them and the other one cornered us again in the intensive care unit and started peppering us with questions.
[01:38:03.883 --> 01:38:06.364]  Now for those who don't know, you're in Virginia?
[01:38:06.785 --> 01:38:07.005]  Yes.
[01:38:07.565 --> 01:38:08.586]  You're in Virginia?
[01:38:08.726 --> 01:38:09.627]  You're a lawyer?
[01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:13.651]  Okay, you're well spoken.
[01:38:13.952 --> 01:38:15.833]  I've been on national TV.
[01:38:16.173 --> 01:38:17.153]  Nice looking guy here.
[01:38:17.453 --> 01:38:18.434]  This is happening to you.
[01:38:18.474 --> 01:38:26.478]  Can you imagine what happens to a farmer family, good people, going to have their third kid, and in almost every case now, demonic creatures appear.
[01:38:26.998 --> 01:38:28.179]  Oh, it's scary.
[01:38:28.199 --> 01:38:36.103]  I felt like all my clients, all the members that I've defended over the years, I suddenly felt their pain, what they were going through.
[01:38:36.616 --> 01:38:43.440]  And it was interesting, the way we turned this last social worker away, it was just the power of God.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:51.425]  I began to share with her the gospel, and I told her, I said, if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, you're going to go to hell.
[01:38:51.605 --> 01:38:52.666]  And I said, you know what hell is?
[01:38:53.026 --> 01:38:55.648]  As I began telling her about that, she said, I got to go.
[01:38:56.128 --> 01:38:57.969]  And I said, wait a minute, I got a Bible for you.
[01:38:57.989 --> 01:38:59.190]  She said, no, I can't take it.
[01:39:00.163 --> 01:39:01.764]  She goes, I can't take any gifts on the job.
[01:39:01.784 --> 01:39:03.906]  I said, take your social worker hat off.
[01:39:03.946 --> 01:39:04.686]  This is for you.
[01:39:04.726 --> 01:39:06.007]  This will help you.
[01:39:06.047 --> 01:39:07.808]  This will show you the way.
[01:39:07.828 --> 01:39:11.251]  So the garlic and holy water had an effect.
[01:39:11.351 --> 01:39:11.911]  That's right.
[01:39:11.991 --> 01:39:14.052]  And she took off and we never saw her again.
[01:39:14.113 --> 01:39:16.154]  So the Holy Spirit went before us that time.
[01:39:16.174 --> 01:39:16.874]  Praise the Lord.
[01:39:17.895 --> 01:39:18.836]  No, yeah, these people.
[01:39:19.416 --> 01:39:21.578]  I tell you what, I just can't believe it.
[01:39:21.618 --> 01:39:22.498]  I can't believe people.
[01:39:23.179 --> 01:39:25.140]  We had Operation Iraqi Freedom, okay?
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:25.780]  Great.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.561]  Saddam's a thug.
[01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:29.316]  Can't we have Operation American Freedom?
[01:39:29.837 --> 01:39:30.637]  Yeah, why not?
[01:39:30.757 --> 01:39:33.379]  You know, if Bush wanted to turn all this around, he would, but he didn't.
[01:39:33.639 --> 01:39:42.625]  He put more funding into the Department of Education, all these other groups, and I... Can't we... We have the conservative, the real conservative backbone to do it.
[01:39:43.445 --> 01:39:52.651]  How, Chris, do we force the Republicans that control everything now to finally get rid of abortion, to finally just axe these social workers?
[01:39:52.912 --> 01:39:53.452]  How do we do it?
[01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:58.091]  Well, it's going to be every man on deck.
[01:39:58.131 --> 01:40:00.832]  We're going to have to be eternally vigilant.
[01:40:00.852 --> 01:40:07.155]  That means you're going to need to make those phone calls at key junctures when legislation is being introduced.
[01:40:07.175 --> 01:40:14.417]  You've got to convince your local legislature and your state to start introducing bills that are going to cut back the size of government.
[01:40:15.678 --> 01:40:18.839]  We do that at Homeschool Legal Defense on parents' rights issues.
[01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:22.580]  We are working on the front line of child welfare reform.
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.041]  We've got a big bill in Texas.
[01:40:24.505 --> 01:40:29.546]  That's going to protect innocents when they're being investigated by social workers.
[01:40:29.906 --> 01:40:32.947]  We're working to defeat legislation like you had in California.
[01:40:33.727 --> 01:40:39.288]  We work on Capitol Hill to try to curtail and restrain social worker power.
[01:40:39.328 --> 01:40:42.869]  So, it takes us joining together, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[01:40:42.909 --> 01:40:48.470]  He said, if we don't hang together, most assuredly, sir, we're going to hang separately.
[01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:49.170]  Absolutely.
[01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:50.030]  Anything else, Phillip?
[01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:52.111]  Yes, I had a question for him.
[01:40:52.131 --> 01:40:56.572]  Sitting here listening to Alex, you asked him a few of the questions he answered for me.
[01:40:57.173 --> 01:41:05.496]  One aspect about this demonic side of it, one place in the scripture where Messiah got very angry and that was when with children.
[01:41:05.836 --> 01:41:11.518]  He said, you suffer these children to come to me for such is the kingdom of heaven and these people are not letting them come to him.
[01:41:11.839 --> 01:41:13.299]  They're like doing what Alex said.
[01:41:13.339 --> 01:41:17.701]  They're learning Islam and all kinds of multicultural crap.
[01:41:18.601 --> 01:41:20.782]  But where are you at in Virginia, Chris?
[01:41:20.822 --> 01:41:21.422]  I'm in Virginia.
[01:41:21.863 --> 01:41:25.444]  Yeah, we're right by Leesburg, Virginia.
[01:41:25.464 --> 01:41:27.165]  We're about 30 miles west.
[01:41:28.486 --> 01:41:30.727]  I appreciate the call, but let's try to not...
[01:41:31.414 --> 01:41:34.595]  Let's try to not, you know, let's lead by example.
[01:41:34.695 --> 01:41:36.656]  I understand this makes people very angry.
[01:41:37.076 --> 01:41:38.216]  Believe me, we're not exaggerating.
[01:41:38.256 --> 01:41:39.817]  It's much worse and it hurts my heart.
[01:41:40.197 --> 01:41:43.098]  Chris, does it hurt your heart because you're even more focused on this than I am?
[01:41:43.478 --> 01:41:46.639]  A lot of us tend to not get in this fight because it is so painful to focus on.
[01:41:46.879 --> 01:41:51.681]  But if we don't focus on these evils and focus on exposing and fighting them, it's going to be worse.
[01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:59.544]  I mean, how do you deal with this every day to know that what we're fighting is so bad and to see the wreckage of these people that don't have conscience?
[01:42:00.407 --> 01:42:02.068]  Oh, it's hard.
[01:42:03.269 --> 01:42:06.951]  As I deal with these social workers, I'm dealing with many times the enemy.
[01:42:07.251 --> 01:42:15.375]  I have to say that I am a Christian and it's through the power of God that I can overcome.
[01:42:15.415 --> 01:42:17.116]  God has blessed His people.
[01:42:17.176 --> 01:42:27.061]  God has blessed those who are standing up for this freedom because we've been able to keep every single family that's a member of homeschooling offense from having their children removed.
[01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:28.202]  We've had no family
[01:42:28.652 --> 01:42:30.813]  Because of homeschooling.
[01:42:31.233 --> 01:42:32.993]  They prey on people that don't know their rights.
[01:42:33.273 --> 01:42:33.834]  Exactly.
[01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:37.215]  The people who have no idea and they let them in the house.
[01:42:37.615 --> 01:42:38.895]  They let them talk to their kids.
[01:42:38.955 --> 01:42:42.356]  Next thing you know, the whole social worker is ushering the kids out.
[01:42:42.376 --> 01:42:43.917]  It's a matter of knowledge.
[01:42:43.997 --> 01:42:45.097]  People need to know.
[01:42:46.077 --> 01:42:48.498]  One of our goals is to get the information out.
[01:42:48.658 --> 01:42:49.178]  Absolutely.
[01:42:49.198 --> 01:42:50.459]  Let's take some more calls.
[01:42:51.159 --> 01:42:53.500]  Let's go ahead and talk to Laura in Alabama.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.300]  Thanks for holding, Laura.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:54.740]  You're on the air.
[01:42:55.705 --> 01:42:58.466]  Yes, I agree with everything he said.
[01:42:58.526 --> 01:43:14.730]  And also, everybody in their community needs to get on the phones and spend about 30 minutes, a couple days a week, talk to their church leaders in these various denominations, call the national associations for these church leaders, because a lot of them are in charge of home schooling.
[01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:16.351]  I mean, Christian schooling.
[01:43:17.131 --> 01:43:20.812]  And they need to expose the ACLU as being total communistic and atheistic.
[01:43:21.492 --> 01:43:24.173]  And the same thing they need to expose is what
[01:43:25.982 --> 01:43:28.823]  About the homeschoolers and the rights of the homeschoolers?
[01:43:28.843 --> 01:43:43.230]  Well, the ACLU, what they do is, they take key cases and lose them to create bad case law, and they then defend stuff that doesn't even exist, and they could care less when cops are breaking pro-life demonstrators' arms for no reason.
[01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:45.811]  They could care less when CPS grabs somebody's kid.
[01:43:45.831 --> 01:43:47.152]  So yeah, they are loyal opposition.
[01:43:47.732 --> 01:43:55.636]  If everybody just spent, that's not working, that can spend 30 minutes to an hour, a couple days a week, and call these numbers,
[01:43:56.027 --> 01:44:03.814]  Make it real brief and to the point, and just keep doing it, and going down the yellow pages in the phone book, calling these mainline church leaders.
[01:44:04.314 --> 01:44:09.259]  Some of them won't listen and some of them will act interested, but they've got to just keep doing it.
[01:44:09.519 --> 01:44:14.804]  We've got to create a grassroots understanding of what we're facing in the system.
[01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:16.786]  Laura, anything else?
[01:44:16.806 --> 01:44:21.490]  What's so amazing is James Kennedy and the American Family Association and TexMars and others,
[01:44:22.653 --> 01:44:34.402]  Marlon Maddox have exposed these things and yet people listen to them on television and mainline radio stations and it's just not, people just aren't waking up fast enough where they expect someone else to do it.
[01:44:34.742 --> 01:44:34.982]  Right.
[01:44:35.843 --> 01:44:41.627]  Well we better, and the main problem is Bush is coming now and I've seen a lot of conservatives go to sleep.
[01:44:42.607 --> 01:44:46.670]  And let me tell you the attack is on as Chris just said, this is a war, the war hasn't ended.
[01:44:46.991 --> 01:44:51.634]  One more segment with Chris and then we'll come back and talk to Pat and John.
[01:44:52.634 --> 01:44:58.720]  In this final segment with our guests, be sure and visit InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.541]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:04.349 --> 01:45:11.738]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:11.998 --> 01:45:16.743]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:16.963 --> 01:45:22.630]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:27.375]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:45:27.595 --> 01:45:34.762]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:45:34.783 --> 01:45:39.087]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:45:39.467 --> 01:45:42.008]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:45:42.208 --> 01:45:48.972]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:45:49.152 --> 01:45:54.414]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:54.434 --> 01:45:54.854]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:03.326 --> 01:46:14.054]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:46:14.234 --> 01:46:21.799]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.202]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:46:25.482 --> 01:46:31.224]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:46:31.504 --> 01:46:37.666]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:46:38.026 --> 01:46:41.927]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:46:41.967 --> 01:46:43.848]  The water level is always visible.
[01:46:44.048 --> 01:46:49.993]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:46:50.213 --> 01:46:54.476]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.105 --> 01:47:03.826]  Are you prepared?
[01:47:04.046 --> 01:47:06.429]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:11.075]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:47:11.395 --> 01:47:14.860]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:17.223]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:47:17.563 --> 01:47:21.924]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[01:47:22.164 --> 01:47:25.105]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:32.287]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[01:47:32.507 --> 01:47:37.829]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[01:47:38.089 --> 01:47:43.090]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[01:47:43.311 --> 01:47:44.431]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:44.911]  The book
[01:47:45.171 --> 01:47:49.833]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:47:50.053 --> 01:47:53.974]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:47:54.114 --> 01:47:55.915]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free, 1-800-255-1912.
[01:47:55.935 --> 01:47:57.075]  That's 800-255-1912, or visit arkinstitute.com.
[01:47:57.135 --> 01:47:59.696]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:14.182 --> 01:48:18.464]  Now understand, you're not in more danger of you homeschool of coming into their net.
[01:48:18.484 --> 01:48:19.705]  You're actually much safer.
[01:48:19.825 --> 01:48:22.546]  It's a lot more horrible in their schools.
[01:48:22.806 --> 01:48:25.407]  Kids are now being arrested for stepping in water puddles.
[01:48:25.447 --> 01:48:26.488]  That's an aggressive move.
[01:48:26.868 --> 01:48:28.789]  Arrested for playing dodgeball secretly.
[01:48:28.829 --> 01:48:31.150]  That's a aggression crime.
[01:48:32.151 --> 01:48:36.032]  They're trying to force most of the kids on Prozac and Ritalin and other drugs.
[01:48:36.633 --> 01:48:39.154]  I mean it really is like a bad science fiction movie.
[01:48:39.734 --> 01:48:41.595]  So you're much safer getting out of their system.
[01:48:42.518 --> 01:48:43.918]  And you need to do it, folks.
[01:48:43.958 --> 01:48:45.439]  You need to protect your family.
[01:48:45.459 --> 01:48:46.399]  You need to get away.
[01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:48.180]  This government's gone bad, period.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.120]  And we've got to stand against it.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.381]  I know we've got a lot of other callers here.
[01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:54.041]  I don't know if we have time to get to them with our guest.
[01:48:54.281 --> 01:48:54.781]  We'll try.
[01:48:55.822 --> 01:48:59.603]  Before I go back to our guest, though, just go to InfoWars.com.
[01:48:59.663 --> 01:49:00.963]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:01.483 --> 01:49:04.644]  Get my videos, my eight videos, or just get one of them.
[01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.144]  Get my book, Dissent and the Tyranny.
[01:49:06.665 --> 01:49:11.646]  Find out the real crimes being committed by people running this government, at all levels.
[01:49:12.242 --> 01:49:14.363]  Find out the true horror of what we're facing.
[01:49:14.644 --> 01:49:19.807]  You need to face it and be man enough, be woman enough to know the whole of the truth as Patrick Henry said.
[01:49:20.928 --> 01:49:22.669]  Because denying it doesn't mean it goes away.
[01:49:23.429 --> 01:49:27.712]  The horrors, the crimes these people have committed, the things that we've proven they've done.
[01:49:29.548 --> 01:49:33.151]  Folks, I hope you go to InfoWars.com or Net, or I hope you call toll free to get my videos.
[01:49:33.171 --> 01:49:33.231]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:33.271 --> 01:49:33.671]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:49:33.711 --> 01:49:35.432]  Or again, InfoWars.com or Net.
[01:49:35.452 --> 01:49:36.793]  Don't wait, get the videos.
[01:49:36.813 --> 01:49:37.014]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:37.054 --> 01:49:39.335]  Road to Tyranny, Max is a Terror, the two newest.
[01:49:57.829 --> 01:50:01.773]  Chris, how do folks contact the Homeschool Legal Defense Association?
[01:50:01.833 --> 01:50:02.593]  How do they join?
[01:50:02.613 --> 01:50:03.394]  How do they get involved?
[01:50:03.634 --> 01:50:03.934]  Sure.
[01:50:04.855 --> 01:50:12.461]  If anyone's interested in homeschooling or you're a veteran homeschooler, we have a free packet that we will send you if you call 540-338-5600.
[01:50:12.481 --> 01:50:12.982]  That's 540-338-5600.
[01:50:21.641 --> 01:50:25.702]  5600.
[01:50:23.042 --> 01:50:25.702]  We will send you a free homeschooling pack.
[01:50:25.722 --> 01:50:27.043]  Tells you how to get started.
[01:50:27.083 --> 01:50:28.843]  Tells you about the laws in your state.
[01:50:29.603 --> 01:50:35.805]  Or you can go to our webpage, which is HSLDA.org.
[01:50:36.365 --> 01:50:39.446]  HSLDA.org.
[01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:43.427]  And we've got lots of information on social services on that webpage.
[01:50:43.487 --> 01:50:45.368]  It's a very extensive webpage.
[01:50:45.468 --> 01:50:46.288]  All the information you need.
[01:50:46.328 --> 01:50:46.948]  You can join.
[01:50:47.846 --> 01:51:05.005]  Well, Chris, I can only commend you and this beast, this system is stomping around roaring seeing who it can devour, seeing who will submit to it and go along with it.
[01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:06.567]  And as you said, everyone you've helped,
[01:51:07.142 --> 01:51:08.042]  Hasn't had a problem.
[01:51:08.102 --> 01:51:09.383]  They just know their basic rights.
[01:51:09.823 --> 01:51:13.425]  That's why they haven't given the children, told them their rights in school, so they don't know.
[01:51:14.005 --> 01:51:16.526]  Let's talk to Don in Missouri.
[01:51:16.546 --> 01:51:17.626]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:51:17.646 --> 01:51:18.287]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:51:20.588 --> 01:51:21.288]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:22.348]  Don't have long.
[01:51:22.748 --> 01:51:23.749]  Okay, Don's gone.
[01:51:24.549 --> 01:51:26.510]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Missouri.
[01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:27.350]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:27.790]  Go ahead.
[01:51:28.191 --> 01:51:29.491]  Hello, Alex.
[01:51:29.591 --> 01:51:31.952]  Very good guest you got on there today.
[01:51:32.713 --> 01:51:35.934]  I wanted to ask him a couple of questions because I know that there is
[01:51:36.727 --> 01:51:47.335]  That when an American becomes a 14th Amendment citizen, our status at law changes because we are no longer sovereign free men and have exercised sovereignty.
[01:51:47.355 --> 01:51:49.696]  You're talking about privileges instead of rights.
[01:51:49.756 --> 01:51:51.378]  You only have about a minute left.
[01:51:51.398 --> 01:51:52.218]  What's your other question?
[01:51:52.378 --> 01:51:59.123]  Well, I wanted to ask him how he approaches the legal defense standpoint from that particular standpoint.
[01:51:59.143 --> 01:52:03.066]  He got asked this question a year ago on this show and he said from a constitutional perspective, correct?
[01:52:04.147 --> 01:52:04.567]  That's right.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.041]  Yeah, we defend our members.
[01:52:07.301 --> 01:52:08.581]  You know, we go right to court.
[01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:12.463]  We defend them on the First Amendment ground, the right to freely exercise their religious beliefs.
[01:52:12.823 --> 01:52:17.985]  We defend them on the 14th Amendment Parental Liberty Clause that comes out of there.
[01:52:18.386 --> 01:52:22.787]  We haven't fought the jurisdiction battle yet, although we're sympathetic to it.
[01:52:23.788 --> 01:52:28.410]  So far, God's blessed us with a lot of victories in the court.
[01:52:30.442 --> 01:52:31.263]  All right.
[01:52:31.323 --> 01:52:32.504]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[01:52:33.225 --> 01:52:36.949]  Chris, I really appreciate you coming on the show and look forward to having you back on and great work.
[01:52:37.449 --> 01:52:38.270]  Oh, well, thank you.
[01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:40.112]  I appreciate your good work as well.
[01:52:40.272 --> 01:52:40.932]  Take care, my friend.
[01:52:41.293 --> 01:52:41.633]  All right.
[01:52:41.653 --> 01:52:41.833]  Bye-bye.
[01:52:41.913 --> 01:52:42.194]  All right.
[01:52:42.294 --> 01:52:48.600]  Third hour, your calls, a bunch of news from around the globe that I haven't gotten to yet, but this is a serious subject.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.701]  This is the free country?
[01:52:49.741 --> 01:52:51.623]  No, that's not a free country when this is going on.
[01:52:53.749 --> 01:52:56.751]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:57.091 --> 01:53:02.015]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:53:02.255 --> 01:53:04.717]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they've been hit.
[01:53:07.498 --> 01:53:10.701]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.199 --> 01:53:19.840]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:21.541]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.261 --> 01:53:23.362]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.023 --> 01:53:24.843]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.604 --> 01:53:26.505]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.165 --> 01:53:30.868]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.348 --> 01:53:35.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:40.175 --> 01:53:41.316]  All right, my friends.
[01:53:41.576 --> 01:53:43.798]  Already into this third and final hour.
[01:53:43.818 --> 01:53:46.440]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:53:46.981 --> 01:53:47.761]  until 2 p.m.
[01:53:48.262 --> 01:53:51.204]  Central Standard Time, then back from 9 to midnight.
[01:53:53.586 --> 01:53:54.687]  Central Standard Time.
[01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:59.130]  We simulcast not just on AM and FM, but on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 or 93.20, and at night at 5.085 and 68.90.
[01:54:06.295 --> 01:54:13.220]  Our websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.962]  Mike in Indiana and others, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:19.264]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:19.284 --> 01:54:29.932]  Some of the articles I want to talk about this hour, government lawyers say burglars need protection from violent householders.
[01:54:30.172 --> 01:54:31.373]  Now, we see this everywhere.
[01:54:32.142 --> 01:54:34.063]  Again, can't play dodgeball in school anymore.
[01:54:34.083 --> 01:54:35.444]  You get arrested if you do.
[01:54:35.504 --> 01:54:37.165]  It's a hate crime.
[01:54:37.225 --> 01:54:38.645]  Can't defend yourself against burglars.
[01:54:38.665 --> 01:54:40.906]  Not just in England, but now in this country in many areas.
[01:54:42.727 --> 01:54:44.028]  Grand juries are now indicting.
[01:54:44.068 --> 01:54:45.749]  Someone in your house attacking you viciously.
[01:54:45.769 --> 01:54:46.149]  You shoot them.
[01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.869]  You go to jail.
[01:54:46.929 --> 01:54:47.750]  It's the new America.
[01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:48.590]  Everything's changing.
[01:54:49.631 --> 01:54:53.052]  Training us to submit to their criminal classes that they control.
[01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:58.495]  We'll also go to some of Bush's speech where they said basically they're going to attack a bunch of countries and quote, bring liberty.
[01:54:58.515 --> 01:55:00.016]  Because we lose our liberty here.
[01:55:00.965 --> 01:55:02.266]  Bush is not a conservative, folks.
[01:55:02.286 --> 01:55:03.127]  He's a neocon.
[01:55:03.167 --> 01:55:03.607]  Wake up.
[01:55:04.348 --> 01:55:06.950]  And much more in this third hour.
[01:55:07.491 --> 01:55:09.833]  Again, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:10.373 --> 01:55:14.397]  Mike in Indiana, good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:55:14.437 --> 01:55:14.737]  Welcome.
[01:55:15.237 --> 01:55:16.038]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:17.339 --> 01:55:18.761]  I've called you one time before.
[01:55:18.781 --> 01:55:25.386]  I believe that people will wake up when this comes to their own doorstep.
[01:55:26.167 --> 01:55:28.369]  And I do believe that it's the method of gun control
[01:55:29.099 --> 01:55:33.520]  Because I believe that the purpose of our arms is to protect our children.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.241]  And when we fail to do that, guns are not to be protected in themselves.
[01:55:39.341 --> 01:55:43.482]  They're for the purpose of protecting our children and our families.
[01:55:44.543 --> 01:55:54.165]  As a pastor, the way we have handled social services doing this very thing, is the Bible says if we would judge ourselves, we need not be judged.
[01:55:54.205 --> 01:55:58.466]  So our church gets involved
[01:55:59.495 --> 01:56:09.278]  In this process, whenever we hear of social services entering into a home and starting this abuse, we notify... No, no, you don't let them into the house.
[01:56:09.518 --> 01:56:10.079]  That's right.
[01:56:10.239 --> 01:56:12.519]  But sometimes they do.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:21.462]  Under fear, they don't know what to do, and then if they contact us, they hear that we get involved to help people in this situation.
[01:56:22.803 --> 01:56:24.483]  We become aggressive.
[01:56:24.704 --> 01:56:28.885]  We notify and contact the social services ourselves.
[01:56:29.767 --> 01:56:33.669]  We inform them that we are beginning an investigation.
[01:56:33.729 --> 01:56:37.352]  We sit down with the family first and find out all the details.
[01:56:38.232 --> 01:56:44.336]  And then we become very aggressive as to the violations that the social services have made against these families.
[01:56:45.457 --> 01:56:49.279]  And many times they will back off.
[01:56:50.091 --> 01:56:59.275]  When they know that the church is going to have a hearing... Let me give you the psychology here, because they're the biggest pack of liars I've ever seen from the stuff we've studied here locally.
[01:56:59.295 --> 01:57:01.555]  I mean, the cases we've covered on the air.
[01:57:02.196 --> 01:57:03.716]  We've been there, folks, at the hospital.
[01:57:03.756 --> 01:57:04.757]  We've been there, we've seen this.
[01:57:05.877 --> 01:57:07.338]  All I've ever seen is pure lies from them.
[01:57:07.598 --> 01:57:10.539]  But it's like hyenas that have got a baby gazelle cornered.
[01:57:11.099 --> 01:57:14.721]  If they think they can kill the gazelle with no problem, they'll go ahead and do it.
[01:57:15.081 --> 01:57:18.042]  But if they know others are involved, they'll back off.
[01:57:18.062 --> 01:57:18.683]  They're predators.
[01:57:18.703 --> 01:57:20.163]  They want an easy kill.
[01:57:20.423 --> 01:57:23.105]  They're going to move on if somebody doesn't know what they're doing, doesn't know their rights.
[01:57:23.445 --> 01:57:24.625]  Is that what you've seen happen?
[01:57:24.905 --> 01:57:26.006]  This is the answer.
[01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:36.751]  When we get involved and we won't let each other... We made an agreement within our church family that we will not let the government move in and isolate us.
[01:57:36.791 --> 01:57:39.672]  We'll come and stand together if we've got to break the roadblocks.
[01:57:40.844 --> 01:57:42.669]  And we have done this.
[01:57:42.689 --> 01:57:43.432]  There have been a...
[01:57:44.678 --> 01:57:59.791]  A young boy that was taken out in Kentucky, and just to make a long story short, we notified the judge that was involved in this case after looking over the records.
[01:57:59.911 --> 01:58:05.576]  We notified the social services and we also notified the governor of the state of Kentucky.
[01:58:05.596 --> 01:58:06.256]  And what happened?
[01:58:07.217 --> 01:58:08.998]  He had the child released.
[01:58:09.299 --> 01:58:09.839]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:58:09.859 --> 01:58:11.440]  You've got to have friends, you've got to have community.
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:12.121]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:14.716 --> 01:58:16.317]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:16.677 --> 01:58:22.420]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.802]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:28.142 --> 01:58:35.326]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes,
[01:58:35.486 --> 01:58:37.468]  Radon 222 and much, much more.
[01:58:37.788 --> 01:58:42.732]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:58:43.052 --> 01:58:47.095]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:58:47.275 --> 01:58:51.999]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:58:52.399 --> 01:58:58.366]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:58:58.646 --> 01:59:04.874]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:04.934 --> 01:59:05.915]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:05.975 --> 01:59:07.176]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:15.373 --> 01:59:22.740]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:27.765]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:27.985 --> 01:59:33.631]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:33.871 --> 01:59:45.755]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:45.775 --> 01:59:46.575]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:59:46.615 --> 01:59:50.337]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.497 --> 01:59:52.998]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:59:53.238 --> 01:59:59.940]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:05.425]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.445 --> 02:00:05.866]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:15.447 --> 02:00:19.969]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:00:20.309 --> 02:00:24.411]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:00:24.691 --> 02:00:25.251]  We listened.
[02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:30.533]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:00:30.813 --> 02:00:31.294]  We listened.
[02:00:31.674 --> 02:00:34.715]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:00:35.135 --> 02:00:35.675]  We listened.
[02:00:36.136 --> 02:00:39.297]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:00:39.517 --> 02:00:39.717]  I think?
[02:01:06.051 --> 02:01:10.312]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:01:10.512 --> 02:01:11.932]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:15.233 --> 02:01:17.453]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:18.013 --> 02:01:20.914]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:24.854 --> 02:01:25.815]  We're back live.
[02:01:26.275 --> 02:01:32.136]  We're going into a world where if you're a good, decent person, you're an enemy of the state because you're not a criminal.
[02:01:32.176 --> 02:01:33.036]  They can't trust you.
[02:01:34.651 --> 02:01:36.232]  You might fight what they're doing.
[02:01:36.252 --> 02:01:38.033]  You might fight the world they're setting up.
[02:01:39.074 --> 02:01:39.454]  That's right.
[02:01:39.474 --> 02:01:41.936]  That's what happens when the evil are in control.
[02:01:43.016 --> 02:01:45.638]  Government lawyers say burglars need protection.
[02:01:46.318 --> 02:01:49.180]  This is London Dependent by Robert Verkark.
[02:01:49.821 --> 02:01:51.622]  Legal Affairs Correspondent.
[02:01:51.682 --> 02:01:56.665]  Government lawyers trying to keep the Norfolk farmer, Tony Martin, behind bars.
[02:01:57.631 --> 02:02:05.452]  We'll tell a high court judge tomorrow that burglars are members of the public who must be protected from violent householders.
[02:02:06.733 --> 02:02:12.854]  The case could help hundreds of criminals bring claims for damages for injury suffered while committing offenses.
[02:02:14.594 --> 02:02:16.454]  And of course, you probably heard of the Tony Martin case.
[02:02:16.474 --> 02:02:17.234]  Now it's worse.
[02:02:17.315 --> 02:02:20.015]  People stab attackers in their homes at night.
[02:02:20.515 --> 02:02:21.595]  They're being charged.
[02:02:23.376 --> 02:02:25.476]  And in the case of Martin,
[02:02:26.368 --> 02:02:32.828]  He'd been robbed three times and the gypsies came back into his house again and were going after him and one of them had a weapon.
[02:02:34.238 --> 02:02:37.579]  That didn't matter, and so he shotgunned both of them, killed and injured one.
[02:02:38.019 --> 02:02:39.000]  Killed one, injured the other.
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:43.001]  And Martin's what, he's got life in prison and all these big fines and fees.
[02:02:43.021 --> 02:02:45.122]  They wanted to commute the sentence because of public outrage.
[02:02:45.142 --> 02:02:47.262]  The government could care less what the people want.
[02:02:47.742 --> 02:02:54.445]  Like 75%, 80% of England, people over in Britain, Britannia, don't want to go into the Euro, the EU.
[02:02:54.485 --> 02:02:56.785]  But the government said, we don't care what you want!
[02:02:57.686 --> 02:02:59.286]  You know, this is the new freedom!
[02:02:59.846 --> 02:03:01.067]  Democracy!
[02:03:02.449 --> 02:03:17.174]  In legal papers seen by the Independent, Home Office lawyers dispute Mr. Martin's contention that he poses no risk to the public because he only represents a threat to burglars and other criminals who trespass on his property or inside his house.
[02:03:19.074 --> 02:03:28.077]  They say the suggestion that the parole board was not required to assess the risk posed by Mr. Martin, the future burglars are intruders on the grounds that they do not
[02:03:29.048 --> 02:03:31.690]  So this is the government taking your basic right of self-defense
[02:03:54.207 --> 02:03:56.369]  See, they're saying the government is God.
[02:03:56.809 --> 02:04:13.304]  You're going to be so trained, you're going to let that thug rape your wife, you're going to let that thug rob your house, you're going to let that thug take your car, and you're going to let them do it over and over again, but don't worry, we're going to have lots of militarized police to keep you safe, and three and a half million cameras in England.
[02:04:14.218 --> 02:04:20.519]  But the crime rate exploding and then they've taken all their guns and bringing in more illegals, I guess making them legal.
[02:04:20.599 --> 02:04:23.560]  The tunnel is a doorway from France.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.741]  The Red Cross is a staging ground for the illegals, pouring them in by the thousands every day.
[02:04:27.781 --> 02:04:29.582]  The police have been ordered to stand down.
[02:04:30.722 --> 02:04:33.742]  Turns out the British government protected bombers.
[02:04:34.503 --> 02:04:36.963]  More government-sponsored terrorism coming out too.
[02:04:37.063 --> 02:04:40.244]  So, there you have it.
[02:04:41.728 --> 02:04:52.073]  It's saying that a recent report by the Law Commission, which advises ministers on proposed changes to the law, argued that judges had to be willing to reject criminals' claims for damages.
[02:04:52.614 --> 02:04:59.017]  The Commission insisted that even a criminal who has committed a serious offense must be allowed to exercise his civil rights.
[02:04:59.317 --> 02:05:00.778]  And they're winning suits here in this country.
[02:05:01.338 --> 02:05:06.481]  There have been criminals who've come in through skylights, fallen, broken their back,
[02:05:07.156 --> 02:05:10.878]  And they sue and win because that person didn't put burglar bars over the skylight.
[02:05:11.299 --> 02:05:12.980]  Someone could have fallen in and gotten hurt.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:19.844]  People broken in cars, cut arteries, gone to the hospital, suing because your car cut them, and winning!
[02:05:21.225 --> 02:05:21.785]  Winning!
[02:05:23.046 --> 02:05:24.207]  The government is evil.
[02:05:24.407 --> 02:05:26.048]  This is what happens when the government is evil.
[02:05:26.628 --> 02:05:27.709]  It's pure evil.
[02:05:29.290 --> 02:05:29.710]  Pure evil.
[02:05:32.546 --> 02:05:34.749]  Oh man, I've got a bunch of these articles here.
[02:05:35.329 --> 02:05:44.320]  I'm going to get to all the British terrorism, government-sponsored terrorism, and here's MI5, and it's, we let suicide bombers slip through the net!
[02:05:45.461 --> 02:05:48.685]  And that is out of the Times of London.
[02:05:48.705 --> 02:05:50.127]  I've got a bunch of these articles.
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:51.300]  Here's another one.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:54.541]  Dead cameraman carried white flag.
[02:05:55.141 --> 02:06:04.243]  Israeli soldiers who killed a British television cameraman, James Miller, in southern Gaza could have been, in no doubt, about his identity as he was a journalist, according to witnesses.
[02:06:04.603 --> 02:06:11.684]  They said yesterday that he was shot at close range while in a group carrying a large white flag and shouting, repeatedly, that they were journalists.
[02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:15.465]  There have been dozens of journalists killed in the last month.
[02:06:15.705 --> 02:06:19.866]  And, of course, American citizens being run over by tanks and armored vehicles and bulldozers and
[02:06:21.605 --> 02:06:23.145]  It's just open season over there.
[02:06:23.486 --> 02:06:26.206]  I guess they don't want media there to cover what's going on.
[02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:29.587]  I mean, it's scary, folks.
[02:06:30.287 --> 02:06:32.848]  The government's the only one that can authorize or use force.
[02:06:33.488 --> 02:06:37.569]  Even in your own house, they want you to know they're not allowed to protect yourself.
[02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:41.070]  You will be given stiff sentences if you do.
[02:06:41.110 --> 02:06:42.670]  And they're taking juries away in England.
[02:06:42.690 --> 02:06:44.791]  They're getting rid of the Magna Carta.
[02:06:45.771 --> 02:06:46.571]  They're doing that here.
[02:06:46.611 --> 02:06:49.112]  The American Bar Association's called for getting rid of the Magna Carta.
[02:06:51.152 --> 02:06:52.553]  The jury system.
[02:06:53.293 --> 02:06:56.055]  Stuff that even predates the Constitution is going bye-bye.
[02:06:56.075 --> 02:07:07.583]  Let's just go ahead and talk to... Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, Mike in Illinois, and then Tim... Oh, Tim in Texas is next.
[02:07:11.786 --> 02:07:13.126]  Okay, well you know what I'm gonna do?
[02:07:15.308 --> 02:07:17.009]  I'm gonna talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:07:18.690 --> 02:07:19.811]  Mike in Illinois, are you there?
[02:07:21.892 --> 02:07:23.254]  Okay, he's not there.
[02:07:23.394 --> 02:07:24.815]  Who did you want me to go to?
[02:07:24.835 --> 02:07:27.798]  Tim in Texas!
[02:07:27.878 --> 02:07:29.300]  All righty, you're on the air, Tim.
[02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:30.401]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:07:30.861 --> 02:07:31.282]  Pretty good.
[02:07:32.183 --> 02:07:41.532]  Alex, what I wanted to talk about is Texas is still a sovereign foreign nation republic, and you were born on Republican Texas soil.
[02:07:42.013 --> 02:07:44.015]  They never got a treaty for annexation.
[02:07:44.764 --> 02:07:50.085]  And your gun right protection is under the 1836 Republican Texas Constitution.
[02:07:51.186 --> 02:07:53.706]  It's also in the Texas state constitution.
[02:07:53.786 --> 02:07:57.247]  Well that's a de facto military occupational constitution.
[02:07:57.727 --> 02:08:00.728]  The only constitution for Texas is the original 1836.
[02:08:00.768 --> 02:08:04.649]  Well you know everything you're saying is true, but a bunch of fruitcakes
[02:08:05.650 --> 02:08:08.292]  Uh, got involved with the Republic of Texas and made it look really stupid.
[02:08:08.392 --> 02:08:12.754]  I know, but Alex, they never got a treaty for annexation.
[02:08:13.195 --> 02:08:16.217]  Texas still stands as a sovereign foreign nation.
[02:08:16.677 --> 02:08:25.422]  And like that girl down at the hospital that you went to go try to help that got her baby taken by those kidnappers from... Did you see that newscast?
[02:08:25.742 --> 02:08:28.424]  Well, yeah, I listened to your program on shortwave.
[02:08:28.784 --> 02:08:30.665]  Oh no, on the TV show I played footage of it.
[02:08:30.745 --> 02:08:31.005]  Okay.
[02:08:32.398 --> 02:08:43.474]  If that girl had taken an oath to the 1836 Constitution and make a declaration of citizenship in the Republic of Texas, they don't have jurisdiction.
[02:08:43.514 --> 02:08:45.117]  They have wanted jurisdiction.
[02:08:45.337 --> 02:08:46.158]  That's not true.
[02:08:46.299 --> 02:08:47.440]  That's true, Alex.
[02:08:48.732 --> 02:08:49.032]  Yep.
[02:08:50.173 --> 02:08:52.936]  You really think the government doesn't even follow their own laws, sir?
[02:08:53.336 --> 02:08:54.617]  They're a pack of lying criminals.
[02:08:54.957 --> 02:09:03.204]  Yes, that's true, but Texas still stands as a sovereign nation, so these illegal... A sovereign nation stands when it has force to back it up.
[02:09:04.425 --> 02:09:06.627]  And it has an educated population.
[02:09:07.028 --> 02:09:08.249]  Tim, I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:09:08.289 --> 02:09:10.671]  For those that don't know, Texas was illegally annexed.
[02:09:11.231 --> 02:09:13.293]  It had occupational governors in place.
[02:09:13.733 --> 02:09:15.455]  Two were removed at gunpoint.
[02:09:15.495 --> 02:09:16.836]  They don't teach that in school anymore.
[02:09:17.942 --> 02:09:19.844]  Uh, the state was illegally annexed.
[02:09:20.705 --> 02:09:22.687]  Let me finish, let me finish.
[02:09:23.227 --> 02:09:26.810]  All the states of the union, Hawaii was taken by military force.
[02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:27.611]  That's correct.
[02:09:27.931 --> 02:09:29.733]  Uh, Hawaii was never part of anything.
[02:09:30.213 --> 02:09:31.715]  Same as Texas, even worse with Hawaii.
[02:09:31.735 --> 02:09:34.257]  They actually killed, uh, their leadership.
[02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:36.374]  So that's a reality.
[02:09:36.975 --> 02:09:40.776]  We as states, all the states, have the right of revolt.
[02:09:41.256 --> 02:09:45.157]  New Hampshire has it in its amendments, the right to secede.
[02:09:45.937 --> 02:09:49.838]  They claim that that was answered in the Civil War, but it was not answered.
[02:09:49.858 --> 02:09:53.159]  And that is clearly still in the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:58.161]  But, just like Indiana, you know, has the right to secede.
[02:09:58.181 --> 02:09:59.581]  It's not just Texas or Hawaii.
[02:09:59.641 --> 02:10:04.883]  Texas and Hawaii have stronger cases, because from the beginning they never signed the contracts.
[02:10:05.828 --> 02:10:08.929]  But still, sir, it's a Civil War question.
[02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:20.454]  They will send federal troops in, they will lay siege, they will burn cities, and the average person... People were a hundred times more educated about real politics and liberty
[02:10:21.761 --> 02:10:22.362]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:10:22.442 --> 02:10:22.702]  That's true.
[02:10:36.778 --> 02:10:42.463]  So it's not just to either long live the south on one end and them darn northerners.
[02:10:42.483 --> 02:10:44.004]  The whole thing is a scam.
[02:10:44.264 --> 02:10:45.005]  That's correct.
[02:10:45.085 --> 02:10:50.550]  But Texas still stands today, Alex, under the 1839 National Flag.
[02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:56.895]  Yeah, and my 4th Amendment does too, but at the checkpoint, the cops in the black ski masks got MP5s and they don't care.
[02:10:57.075 --> 02:10:58.636]  They've been told there is no 4th Amendment.
[02:10:59.717 --> 02:11:02.999]  You're claiming a foreign government constitution.
[02:11:03.059 --> 02:11:06.201]  Your constitution because you were born up near Dallas somewhere.
[02:11:06.221 --> 02:11:07.221]  I'm trying to explain to you.
[02:11:07.782 --> 02:11:08.922]  I'm trying to explain something.
[02:11:09.363 --> 02:11:11.304]  They don't even follow their own laws now, my friend.
[02:11:12.545 --> 02:11:13.545]  Don't you understand that?
[02:11:13.805 --> 02:11:15.446]  I know, because they're running them up.
[02:11:16.147 --> 02:11:16.607]  That's it.
[02:11:16.807 --> 02:11:19.268]  But the Texas Constitution... Let me stop you.
[02:11:19.308 --> 02:11:19.869]  Let me stop you.
[02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.689]  Let me stop you.
[02:11:21.130 --> 02:11:22.490]  I talked about how they're getting rid of juries.
[02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:24.712]  Let me just explain how tyranny works.
[02:11:24.752 --> 02:11:25.532]  I know you're a smart guy.
[02:11:25.572 --> 02:11:26.953]  Let me... For those that don't understand.
[02:11:27.777 --> 02:11:28.978]  Okay, tyranny.
[02:11:29.018 --> 02:11:29.898]  This is how tyranny works.
[02:11:29.978 --> 02:11:35.920]  Judge Walter Smith, federal judge, uh, the Davidians were found not guilty by a jury despite everything he did.
[02:11:37.301 --> 02:11:38.281]  They were found not guilty.
[02:11:38.341 --> 02:11:42.063]  The judge said, called the Davidians out and then instructed the jury.
[02:11:42.083 --> 02:11:42.843]  This is on the record.
[02:11:44.024 --> 02:11:47.065]  Okay, you found them not guilty, but they did have illegal guns.
[02:11:47.265 --> 02:11:52.107]  I want you to go ahead and do the right thing and find that they had guns in the commission of a crime.
[02:11:52.751 --> 02:11:55.012]  Now understand, they were found not guilty of the crime.
[02:11:55.292 --> 02:11:58.573]  How can you then be found guilty of committing a crime with a gun?
[02:11:59.474 --> 02:12:00.134]  So they gave him that.
[02:12:00.154 --> 02:12:01.935]  He gave him 44 years in prison.
[02:12:02.275 --> 02:12:04.276]  Supreme Court ordered Smith to release him.
[02:12:05.016 --> 02:12:05.656]  Didn't do it.
[02:12:06.036 --> 02:12:07.337]  Then the civil trial comes along.
[02:12:07.357 --> 02:12:08.417]  The Davidians are suing.
[02:12:08.817 --> 02:12:14.420]  They take Smith from San Antonio up to the federal courthouse in Waco.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:18.441]  And Smith says, I'm not going to have a jury in this case.
[02:12:19.002 --> 02:12:20.022]  Just new territory.
[02:12:20.915 --> 02:12:24.317]  Just, you know, it's like putting a crown on and saying, I'm king or something.
[02:12:24.697 --> 02:12:26.138]  He said, we're not going to have a jury.
[02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:27.358]  We protested.
[02:12:29.579 --> 02:12:30.180]  That happened.
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:34.862]  And then suddenly the judge says, okay, I'll impanel a seven member secret jury.
[02:12:35.422 --> 02:12:38.204]  Their ruling has no effect on the ruling.
[02:12:38.584 --> 02:12:39.684]  I'll take it in secret.
[02:12:39.964 --> 02:12:42.986]  Then the secret group he impaneled said, I mean, you know, it's crazy.
[02:12:43.607 --> 02:12:44.367]  So that's my point.
[02:12:44.387 --> 02:12:46.367]  They're not even following their own law.
[02:12:46.648 --> 02:12:48.748]  They're just in warp speed corruption.
[02:12:49.308 --> 02:12:56.909]  All Texans need to take an oath to the 1836 Constitution and make a declaration that they're a citizen of the Republic of Texas.
[02:12:57.129 --> 02:12:57.970]  And what does that do?
[02:12:58.830 --> 02:13:01.010]  It makes it so they have watch of jurisdiction.
[02:13:01.190 --> 02:13:09.111]  And then there's some fruitcake calling themselves the... There's 50 presidents, 19 generals, 187 admirals, and no privates.
[02:13:09.652 --> 02:13:10.592]  That's the problem.
[02:13:10.712 --> 02:13:12.072]  Power trip fruitcakes.
[02:13:14.975 --> 02:13:18.879]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:13:19.099 --> 02:13:31.390]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:13:31.810 --> 02:13:32.210]  The U.S.
[02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:37.835]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:13:38.236 --> 02:13:40.438]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:13:42.299 --> 02:13:43.360]  It's bad enough that the U.S.

[02:16:25.643 --> 02:16:29.247]  Is mainstream media telling you everything you should know about the war on terror?
[02:16:29.628 --> 02:16:32.471]  What is our real interest in Iraq and Saddam Hussein?
[02:16:32.871 --> 02:16:36.533]  Who stands to gain if we give up our freedoms in the name of national security?
[02:16:36.913 --> 02:16:40.014]  Who's behind the manipulation of our financial markets, and why?
[02:16:40.314 --> 02:16:41.975]  We're the jury, you be the judge.

[02:17:35.796 --> 02:17:36.537]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:17:36.577 --> 02:17:37.177]  Welcome.
[02:17:39.179 --> 02:17:40.080]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:41.040]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:41.501]  Go ahead.
[02:17:42.021 --> 02:17:44.263]  Okay, a couple of things.
[02:17:44.323 --> 02:17:49.687]  You were talking about BSS before and I've had my experience on the East Coast here and it's
[02:17:51.512 --> 02:17:52.673]  A couple of things.
[02:17:52.953 --> 02:18:05.559]  You had said that in reference to, one fellow was talking about the annexing of Texas and so forth, and then you seemed to be saying, if I understood you right, that yes, there existed
[02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:11.354]  The statues, but the reality of implementing the statues was another story.
[02:18:11.374 --> 02:18:11.874]  Is that correct?
[02:18:11.894 --> 02:18:12.414]  Well, yeah.
[02:18:12.514 --> 02:18:15.376]  I mean, Tim in Texas is a smart guy.
[02:18:15.416 --> 02:18:16.337]  We appreciate his call.
[02:18:16.357 --> 02:18:17.258]  I'm not mad at him.
[02:18:17.278 --> 02:18:18.739]  No, no, I understand.
[02:18:19.059 --> 02:18:22.181]  It's just that I listen to the arguments of the Republic of Texas.
[02:18:22.621 --> 02:18:23.742]  It's an accurate fact.
[02:18:24.282 --> 02:18:34.812]  But you go about educating people, you go about getting a movement, you make it look mainstream, you don't walk around with machine guns saying, I'm an admiral, I'm a general, I'm a president.
[02:18:35.272 --> 02:18:37.674]  It was a joke, it was like clowns or something.
[02:18:38.095 --> 02:18:50.246]  And I'm not saying everybody who was in it was a joke or a clown, but a lot of them, it's like dress-up, it's like make-believe, you know, running around, I'm a general or whatever, and instead of educating people about the facts, like Hawaii!
[02:18:50.931 --> 02:18:54.956]  I mean, this just happened to them less than 100 years ago when they got overtaken.
[02:18:54.976 --> 02:18:59.280]  I mean, military troops came in, shot people, took over, and said, you're a state.
[02:18:59.801 --> 02:19:03.465]  They can definitely reverse what happened, and I think it's good.
[02:19:03.485 --> 02:19:04.726]  I mean, this is not the U.S.
[02:19:04.746 --> 02:19:05.147]  government.
[02:19:05.487 --> 02:19:07.590]  I think states should break off and break away.
[02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:09.711]  Arizona's disgusted.
[02:19:09.771 --> 02:19:12.692]  It needs to happen, but it's got to be done mainstream.
[02:19:13.092 --> 02:19:20.436]  We can't have someone out of the farmhouse declare themselves president and drive around with an entourage of people on a delusional power trip.
[02:19:20.736 --> 02:19:21.896]  And I wanted to say it for a while.
[02:19:21.916 --> 02:19:26.098]  The Republic of Texas was a disgusting joke because of the fruitcakes involved with it.
[02:19:26.138 --> 02:19:26.639]  Go ahead.
[02:19:27.379 --> 02:19:31.461]  You mean that we're involved in trying to reverse the procedure?
[02:19:32.296 --> 02:19:39.583]  Not everyone, I mean not all the presidents, all the admirals, but I mean you just don't do that.
[02:19:40.364 --> 02:19:44.408]  Yeah, well my experience has been in the 20 something years that I've been involved in this.
[02:19:44.870 --> 02:20:02.909]  is that these people uh... don't abide by the law and i mean i i mean it may not be something that you want to set up a radio program but uh... uh... what do you mean something i don't want some of the radio well you know the words i i i feel that sometimes uh... i don't don't use any profanity
[02:20:03.624 --> 02:20:04.344]  I don't.
[02:20:04.404 --> 02:20:04.865]  Not at all.
[02:20:05.025 --> 02:20:06.966]  Well, then, Walter, you can say whatever you want on this show.
[02:20:06.986 --> 02:20:07.946]  There's no censorship.
[02:20:08.386 --> 02:20:08.686]  No, no.
[02:20:09.027 --> 02:20:10.007]  I wouldn't dare do that.
[02:20:10.047 --> 02:20:11.528]  No, but what were you going to say?
[02:20:11.608 --> 02:20:15.790]  That the legislative process that... I'll give you an example.
[02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:17.550]  In New York, they used to have a judge.
[02:20:17.611 --> 02:20:19.772]  They called him the Hanging Judge, okay?
[02:20:20.032 --> 02:20:24.434]  And this judge, he sentenced the fellow to 63 to 135 years on a particular case.
[02:20:28.467 --> 02:20:36.035]  In the instance I'm talking about, the sentence should have run concurrent instead of consecutive.
[02:20:36.835 --> 02:20:50.389]  He turned around and told the defendant's lawyer, he said, listen, the defendant's lawyer pointed out, he said, you can't do that, these are all related to the same indictment, therefore they have to run concurrent, not consecutive.
[02:20:50.768 --> 02:20:52.809]  The judge said, take it to the appeals division.
[02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:55.551]  In other words, he knew exactly what he was doing.
[02:20:55.831 --> 02:21:03.917]  He was forcing this defendant to incur this expense to go to the appeal, which is an expensive, expensive process, at least in New York.
[02:21:04.357 --> 02:21:06.718]  You know, and he did just exactly what he wanted.
[02:21:06.899 --> 02:21:10.181]  Yeah, they commit crimes.
[02:21:10.661 --> 02:21:13.083]  They tell us how they're doing it because they love us so much.
[02:21:13.343 --> 02:21:14.083]  Well, that's my point.
[02:21:14.103 --> 02:21:15.985]  This judge down here in Tucker's is a federal judge.
[02:21:16.565 --> 02:21:18.906]  Smith just said, I'm going to do something never before done.
[02:21:19.006 --> 02:21:19.587]  No jury.
[02:21:20.214 --> 02:21:21.075]  It's just fruitcake land.
[02:21:21.135 --> 02:21:24.920]  At some point, I don't know what the total answer is.
[02:21:33.703 --> 02:21:38.467]  You know, and I've followed this for some 27 years, and I've seen nothing.
[02:21:38.727 --> 02:21:44.633]  You know, I've known that they believe in... You know, I'll tell you what I feel.
[02:21:44.753 --> 02:21:49.137]  I feel that the local lodges, they already have their tips program.
[02:21:49.317 --> 02:21:54.461]  They've had it for years in the form of the local lodges, if you understand what I'm saying.
[02:21:54.761 --> 02:21:58.325]  And not all people that belong to the local lodges are bad people.
[02:21:58.685 --> 02:22:00.887]  You know, they're misinformed people, a lot of them.
[02:22:01.911 --> 02:22:07.074]  But nevertheless, they accomplished the same goal, and they marched to the drum.
[02:22:07.114 --> 02:22:13.618]  Yeah, you've got a lot of useful idiots that are compartmentalized, that are part of the evil, that never look at what they're really part of.
[02:22:13.698 --> 02:22:14.758]  I appreciate the call.
[02:22:14.818 --> 02:22:15.679]  Great points, Jim.
[02:22:16.219 --> 02:22:16.899]  Really good call.
[02:22:16.919 --> 02:22:27.465]  Yeah, I mean, I just remember doing a radio show here in Austin, and the cable show, and I'm so, okay, this is a Republic of Texas thing, you know, I understand the argument, it's legitimate.
[02:22:29.267 --> 02:22:34.694]  And, you know, I would call up and want to interview this president or that president of it, because everyone was declaring themselves president.
[02:22:34.714 --> 02:22:36.436]  You know, I could have said I was a president or something.
[02:22:37.477 --> 02:22:45.147]  And every time we were at a rally or a demonstration about the guns or private property, the cops would go, it's Republic, it's Republic, you know, and oh, we're dangerous.
[02:22:45.647 --> 02:22:46.709]  So I said, well, who is this group?
[02:22:46.749 --> 02:22:47.770]  I want to investigate it.
[02:22:48.837 --> 02:22:50.558]  And it was like delusional fruitcakes.
[02:22:50.578 --> 02:22:52.660]  You know, I can call and get a senator on the show like that.
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.324]  I'd call to get a Republican Texas person on and go, the president is busy right now.
[02:22:58.344 --> 02:23:00.646]  I mean, just how delusional.
[02:23:00.946 --> 02:23:01.927]  It's make-believe.
[02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:06.290]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.711 --> 02:23:08.312]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.332 --> 02:23:11.935]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.077 --> 02:23:21.286]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:23:21.987 --> 02:23:26.454]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared from the- 877-605-9200.
[02:23:26.474 --> 02:23:26.854]  Call today.
[02:23:39.122 --> 02:23:50.035]  The government, the government has set itself up as the big savior.
[02:23:50.135 --> 02:23:53.019]  And it's always there to take care of you.
[02:23:53.059 --> 02:23:55.402]  That it's, that it's got all the answers.
[02:23:56.644 --> 02:24:00.887]  That, oh yeah, they make some mistakes and hurt some people, but you know, they generally want to help.
[02:24:01.508 --> 02:24:04.130]  I've read their own policy papers, their own plans.
[02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:05.591]  They want to dumb you down.
[02:24:05.631 --> 02:24:06.812]  They want to break your family up.
[02:24:06.852 --> 02:24:07.972]  They want to get you on drugs.
[02:24:08.333 --> 02:24:10.494]  They want an enslaved population.
[02:24:11.115 --> 02:24:13.156]  They want control because they're evil.
[02:24:14.898 --> 02:24:17.419]  Now, let me launch into these articles.
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:20.682]  Broad domestic role asks for CIA and the Pentagon.
[02:24:22.068 --> 02:24:31.995]  The Bush Administration leading Senate Republicans sought today to give the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, far-reaching new powers to demand personal and financial records on people in the United States.
[02:24:33.737 --> 02:24:35.818]  That's just part of the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:24:35.838 --> 02:24:43.704]  The proposal, which was beaten back, would have given the CIA and the military the authority to issue administrative subpoenas known as National Security Letters.
[02:24:44.064 --> 02:24:45.265]  That's just a blank check.
[02:24:46.006 --> 02:24:46.806]  No more warrants.
[02:24:46.827 --> 02:24:51.330]  They can already have FISA court do blank checks, but this would be the agency's doing.
[02:24:51.952 --> 02:24:53.073]  And it's not been beaten back.
[02:24:53.093 --> 02:24:53.954]  They're just telling you that.
[02:24:53.974 --> 02:24:54.915]  I want you to know that.
[02:24:56.236 --> 02:24:57.417]  It continues.
[02:25:00.459 --> 02:25:02.341]  Civilian deaths in Baghdad totaled at least 1,101.
[02:25:04.984 --> 02:25:09.666]  And now our government is mowing down any protesters.
[02:25:09.726 --> 02:25:12.547]  They're mowing down protesters.
[02:25:13.087 --> 02:25:15.588]  And in most of the cases, no one fired, no one threw a rock.
[02:25:16.149 --> 02:25:25.572]  Our government just says, this illegitimate government says, this group of criminals says, oh, we were just... thought they might have had a gun, so they mow down kids.
[02:25:25.672 --> 02:25:32.235]  It's worse than Tiananmen Square every day, and you'll never hear about it, and the average person, if you do confront them, goes, good, kill them people!
[02:25:33.343 --> 02:25:37.466]  As our government says, they're going to take all the oil and run the country and set up a dictatorship.
[02:25:37.486 --> 02:25:38.627]  So, that's your freedom.
[02:25:38.867 --> 02:25:40.548]  But we lose our liberty here, remember that.
[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:46.312]  And it says, deeper look at job numbers prompts gloom.
[02:25:46.432 --> 02:25:47.473]  Reuters, the drop in U.S.
[02:25:47.493 --> 02:25:56.760]  jobs in April may not have been as bad as many had feared, but bleak signals within the data have economists convinced that the labor market is even weaker than the headlines suggest.
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:58.981]  Yeah, we're not at 6% unemployment, folks.
[02:26:01.173 --> 02:26:04.555]  They don't count people that have gone off the unemployment rolls for information.
[02:26:04.575 --> 02:26:05.837]  It's well over ten percent.
[02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:12.562]  And a lot of people are working two jobs, so those will count as two jobs in the workforce, and the numbers are even higher.
[02:26:13.923 --> 02:26:21.430]  And you'll hear the neocons go, liberals talk about unemployment, they're liars, the liberals want you to think blah blah blah.
[02:26:21.450 --> 02:26:22.511]  No, it's the system.
[02:26:22.551 --> 02:26:24.112]  It isn't a liberal conservative issue.
[02:26:24.978 --> 02:26:28.801]  So now they admit we have really bad unemployment and NAFTA and GATT has ruined our economy.
[02:26:29.381 --> 02:26:30.763]  It's all part of the globalist plan.
[02:26:30.823 --> 02:26:32.684]  Now, I'm a liberal because I say that.
[02:26:32.744 --> 02:26:35.987]  No, it doesn't matter if it's Bill Clinton or George Bush, the economy's going to get bad.
[02:26:36.307 --> 02:26:37.207]  This is the plan.
[02:26:37.588 --> 02:26:48.796]  They keep it to some weird left-right debate where you can't even get to the issue of NAFTA and GATT because you're so busy hearing national talk show hosts say, oh, the liberals say we're at 6% unemployment.
[02:26:48.816 --> 02:26:49.717]  Oh, gloom and doom.
[02:26:49.797 --> 02:26:50.958]  Oh, listen to those liberals.
[02:26:52.739 --> 02:26:53.440]  What does that mean?
[02:26:54.839 --> 02:26:56.120]  Bush is coming after our guns.
[02:26:56.241 --> 02:26:57.502]  Oh, you're not a liberal, are you?
[02:26:57.522 --> 02:26:58.883]  Well, no, he's getting our guns.
[02:26:59.243 --> 02:27:00.525]  He wants to reinstate all this.
[02:27:00.585 --> 02:27:02.146]  Well, shut up, you're a liberal.
[02:27:03.388 --> 02:27:04.188]  It's crazy.
[02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:07.251]  So there's Napton Gavin, real good for you.
[02:27:07.291 --> 02:27:09.794]  Bush says weapons will be found in Iraq.
[02:27:10.274 --> 02:27:12.016]  President Bush said Saturday, it is a matter of
[02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:20.446]  When, not if, weapons of mass destruction will be found in Iraq, while suggesting the task is getting little help from Saddam Hussein's captured Confederates.
[02:27:21.006 --> 02:27:24.508]  We'll find them, Bush said, of the Iraq's suspected chemical, biological, nuclear weapons.
[02:27:25.029 --> 02:27:26.790]  It'll be a matter of time to do so.
[02:27:26.810 --> 02:27:36.216]  Iraq's alleged possession of such weapons was Bush's main rationale for war, but none has been found since Saddam's government fell more than three months ago.
[02:27:37.794 --> 02:27:40.435]  This is all part of creating this illusion that Bush is always right.
[02:27:40.595 --> 02:27:41.375]  Oh, he's down!
[02:27:41.515 --> 02:27:42.995]  Oh, he's in trouble, people!
[02:27:43.015 --> 02:27:44.236]  They haven't found it!
[02:27:44.256 --> 02:27:47.537]  And then they will find it and they'll go, oh, he's so right!
[02:27:47.557 --> 02:27:48.977]  He's always so right!
[02:27:49.357 --> 02:27:49.577]  Oh!
[02:27:50.457 --> 02:27:54.158]  And remember, he's now landing on aircraft carriers in military uniforms.
[02:27:56.119 --> 02:28:05.302]  Every time, in North Korea and China and Russia, in these militarized police state governments, the leader, the strongman, is always seen with his troops.
[02:28:05.782 --> 02:28:06.902]  Caesar with his troops.
[02:28:07.597 --> 02:28:21.022]  You see how everything now, the nomenclature, the tattletailing, the gun grabbing, the cameras, all this, the police state, the war emperor, always with his troops, always in military parades now.
[02:28:23.683 --> 02:28:26.384]  You start to figure out, folks, I mean, this is serious.
[02:28:27.005 --> 02:28:30.406]  MI5 admits, quote, we let suicide bombers slip through the net.
[02:28:30.846 --> 02:28:32.607]  Britain's security services knew that the
[02:28:33.354 --> 02:28:41.017]  Two Britons who carried out last week's suicide bombing in Israel had links to Islamic extremists but decided they were not potential terrorists, the Telegraph has learned.
[02:28:41.738 --> 02:28:43.198]  Got tried, they work for the government.
[02:28:43.839 --> 02:28:45.620]  We know Israel founded Hamas.
[02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:48.541]  We know it's used as a pretext to scare people into submission.
[02:28:50.422 --> 02:28:53.703]  Continuing, state agency may hand off oversight of children.
[02:28:54.043 --> 02:28:55.544]  I mentioned this last hour.
[02:28:56.925 --> 02:28:59.706]  This is out of KeyNews.com.
[02:29:00.843 --> 02:29:11.007]  This is Key West Newspapers, and it says that the government is now going to hand it over to private security firms because there are so many hundreds of thousands of children in Florida alone that have been seized.
[02:29:11.827 --> 02:29:17.289]  And the case workers have been caught killing and doing so many horrible things to children.
[02:29:17.629 --> 02:29:18.230]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:21.331]  Now we'll make it a profitable venture for the prison industry.
[02:29:21.811 --> 02:29:23.151]  Crowls all your children.
[02:29:23.171 --> 02:29:25.872]  It'll be even worse in there, but so what?
[02:29:26.673 --> 02:29:29.934]  Government's going to ruin the family no matter what it takes unless we stand up.
[02:29:31.929 --> 02:29:33.110]  There's another headline.
[02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:34.290]  Listen to this one.
[02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:36.292]  Neo-colonialism is the new world order.
[02:29:36.672 --> 02:29:38.573]  And they're coming right out with this in mainstream news.
[02:29:38.933 --> 02:29:42.655]  Oh, don't worry, the White House is going to have Loyalty Day.
[02:29:43.536 --> 02:29:47.478]  Loyalty to the government day to be celebrated in all the schools and nationwide.
[02:29:47.498 --> 02:29:58.144]  And it says our children will be taught that the nation is a force for good in the world, extending hope and freedom to others, being part of the Imperial Army.
[02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:01.781]  He grabbed all natural resources and enslaved everyone's children.
[02:30:02.641 --> 02:30:03.902]  Loyalty Day, folks!
[02:30:04.022 --> 02:30:12.844]  And the person that sent me this email when I went to the White House and got the actual article written by the White House, it said, when do I get my black boots and dagger, you know, like the Nazis?
[02:30:14.685 --> 02:30:15.865]  But it sounds real good!
[02:30:15.925 --> 02:30:16.445]  Loyalty!
[02:30:16.485 --> 02:30:18.926]  Learning that we're this good force in the world now!
[02:30:19.326 --> 02:30:20.367]  Loyalty to the government!
[02:30:23.928 --> 02:30:25.108]  They're doing it, folks!
[02:30:25.908 --> 02:30:27.749]  And if we weren't here fighting, it would be a lot worse.
[02:30:29.429 --> 02:30:31.591]  Oh, here's one out of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[02:30:32.592 --> 02:30:37.697]  Jimmy Wynn fears the United Nations, a new world order, and the government implanted tracking devices.
[02:30:37.857 --> 02:30:38.758]  Oh, look, he's crazy.
[02:30:38.798 --> 02:30:40.440]  But wait, they've announced a new world order.
[02:30:41.161 --> 02:30:42.542]  They've announced the U.N.
[02:30:42.562 --> 02:30:42.922]  takeover.
[02:30:42.942 --> 02:30:44.344]  They've announced the implantation.
[02:30:44.384 --> 02:30:45.605]  They want to take Gary out.
[02:30:45.645 --> 02:30:46.346]  It's all over the news.
[02:30:46.706 --> 02:30:47.627]  But he's crazy!
[02:30:49.198 --> 02:31:02.988]  And it says, Wynn had talked about this, police had heard him in the community talking about this, and he got a job at a gun store, and they called his boss and got him fired, and then he found out about this when a reporter came to him about it, and this is your homeland security.
[02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:10.554]  This is what they're doing, and it says the police, the FBI, just wanted folks to know that he had talked about a New World Order, and now he had a job at a gun shop.
[02:31:10.574 --> 02:31:17.960]  And it says, Wynn, 45, was not one of any criminal charges the report advised, just keep an eye on him.
[02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:23.840]  You know, he talks about that New World Order that's all over the news every day.
[02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:29.865]  He talks about the chips, which they're... Sean Hannity's saying every child needs.
[02:31:29.985 --> 02:31:34.689]  I mean, you know... You can't call us crazy when it's on every news channel!
[02:31:36.370 --> 02:31:37.331]  I mean, come on, cops.
[02:31:37.751 --> 02:31:44.316]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, three minutes of two and a half hours... There's three minutes of this film.
[02:31:44.457 --> 02:31:45.457]  That's why everybody should get it.
[02:31:46.198 --> 02:31:46.999]  It's Kansas City.
[02:31:47.899 --> 02:31:48.660]  Kansas City, Missouri.
[02:31:49.710 --> 02:31:50.371]  They're sitting there.
[02:31:53.935 --> 02:31:54.856]  This is going on.
[02:31:56.558 --> 02:31:57.379]  It's FEMA.
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:32:01.404]  And it's a room of police and firemen and sheriff's deputies.
[02:32:02.365 --> 02:32:07.131]  And the FEMA military man gets up there and says, George Washington was a terrorist.
[02:32:07.872 --> 02:32:09.294]  Benjamin Franklin was a terrorist.
[02:32:11.189 --> 02:32:12.829]  Christians are enemies of the federal government.
[02:32:12.849 --> 02:32:13.850]  This is word for word.
[02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:19.451]  They didn't say the white supremacist Christians in this one town said they'll do this, we think they're terrorists.
[02:32:19.911 --> 02:32:21.511]  It was Christians are terrorists.
[02:32:22.132 --> 02:32:23.992]  It was gun owners are terrorists.
[02:32:24.072 --> 02:32:27.013]  It was the founding fathers were terrorists.
[02:32:27.093 --> 02:32:28.513]  Christians are enemies of the government.
[02:32:29.333 --> 02:32:31.834]  Blah, blah, and then we show the training manuals.
[02:32:32.694 --> 02:32:33.214]  On and on.
[02:32:33.274 --> 02:32:34.194]  Homeschoolers.
[02:32:34.674 --> 02:32:36.575]  Those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:32:36.615 --> 02:32:37.255]  Constitution.
[02:32:38.371 --> 02:32:41.072]  And some of the cops, when they were asking the question, who was the first terrorist?
[02:32:41.092 --> 02:32:42.673]  George Washington, the cop says.
[02:32:43.333 --> 02:32:45.654]  And FEMA goes, good, yes, you're right.
[02:32:45.674 --> 02:32:47.194]  Listen, they've been indoctrinated before.
[02:32:47.714 --> 02:33:03.980]  How do these guys, as full-grown men, sit there in a classroom, hearing that George Washington is a terrorist, that Thomas Jefferson is a terrorist, all these founding fathers, that Christians are terrorists, when you swore an oath to that Constitution?
[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:04.300]  What?
[02:33:06.072 --> 02:33:07.372]  I mean, this is what blows me away.
[02:33:07.872 --> 02:33:16.054]  And then I cut to a woman at a checkpoint, Abby Newman, naval veteran, no criminal record, checkpoint in the middle of Virginia, out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:33:16.474 --> 02:33:17.934]  She goes, hey, what's this checkpoint for?
[02:33:18.514 --> 02:33:19.615]  Bill, we're just checking everybody.
[02:33:19.655 --> 02:33:20.695]  Well, what's your probable cause?
[02:33:20.735 --> 02:33:21.435]  Get out of the car!
[02:33:21.475 --> 02:33:22.375]  She's a terrorist, you know.
[02:33:22.795 --> 02:33:24.276]  Oh, look, she's got a constitution.
[02:33:25.416 --> 02:33:27.636]  Oh, look, she's got these videos.
[02:33:29.957 --> 02:33:33.137]  She's got a Patriot Games, Harrison Ford video.
[02:33:33.157 --> 02:33:35.798]  Man, this is really, look at all this contraband.
[02:33:38.163 --> 02:33:40.065]  Folks, we're in the Twilight Zone!
[02:33:40.125 --> 02:33:41.306]  Somebody listen to me!
[02:33:41.886 --> 02:33:50.133]  It's like in the 1950s version of the Body Snatchers, you know, where the doctor goes to the town, they take him over, he busts out, he's running, he's in traffic, up the highway, WAKE UP!
[02:33:50.173 --> 02:33:51.233]  THEY'RE AFTER YOU!
[02:33:51.954 --> 02:33:53.816]  THEY'RE... WE'RE IN DANGER!
[02:33:55.237 --> 02:33:56.918]  Somebody listen to us!
[02:34:00.441 --> 02:34:01.522]  Oh, it's so scary!
[02:34:03.944 --> 02:34:05.325]  WE'RE IN DANGER!
[02:34:06.465 --> 02:34:07.907]  Wake up, please!
[02:34:08.608 --> 02:34:09.810]  Somebody listen!
[02:34:11.653 --> 02:34:18.043]  Because I'm sitting here, and I know they're doing this.
[02:34:18.593 --> 02:34:23.498]  They're teaching our police word for word that our founding fathers were bad.
[02:34:24.118 --> 02:34:25.320]  That Christians are bad.
[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:28.543]  And all these programs have been radically expanded under Bush.
[02:34:28.603 --> 02:34:29.964]  Clinton helped get them going.
[02:34:30.344 --> 02:34:31.666]  Now it's been radically expanded.
[02:34:32.286 --> 02:34:35.549]  And you think as a good old boy out there that Bush is standing up for America.
[02:34:35.569 --> 02:34:43.397]  And you've got your Bush sticker, you know, outdoorsman for Cheney and Bush, or Bush and Cheney, or sportsman for Bush.
[02:34:44.415 --> 02:34:48.276]  I believe in Bush, boy, he's a good Texan, pro-gun.
[02:34:48.856 --> 02:34:51.217]  The guy's trying to pass a bill to register all gun owners.
[02:34:51.437 --> 02:34:53.277]  He's going to reinstate the assault weapons ban.
[02:34:53.978 --> 02:34:56.678]  Clinton's law that we had the big sweep in Congress over.
[02:34:56.698 --> 02:34:59.679]  I mean, wake up!
[02:34:59.819 --> 02:35:00.659]  But, you know what?
[02:35:00.699 --> 02:35:09.342]  The gun grabbing is dwarfed by... They're now past the law, and Jeb Bush signed it, you just heard it, in Florida, where they...
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.949]  Every time someone has a child, CPS comes and decides whether the parent's allowed to have a child?
[02:35:16.032 --> 02:35:16.833]  That's licensing!
[02:35:18.156 --> 02:35:21.203]  This is a... such an evil, evil country.
[02:35:22.128 --> 02:35:31.394]  I love this country, but when you really face how bad things have gotten, and how there's this icky facade, everything's good, mom and apple pie, patriotism, it's not real.
[02:35:31.454 --> 02:35:34.055]  It's as fake as those plastic Chinese flags.
[02:35:34.095 --> 02:35:37.357]  It's as fake as the boxes that said Made in USA in St.
[02:35:37.397 --> 02:35:40.539]  Louis when Bush gave that speech with the Made in China taped over.
[02:35:41.039 --> 02:35:42.480]  It is a rotten facade.
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:44.641]  Under it is maggots and rotten meat.
[02:35:46.643 --> 02:35:48.724]  The stench of this thing, it's just everywhere.
[02:35:49.384 --> 02:35:50.505]  It's freaking me out!
[02:35:53.467 --> 02:35:54.508]  We've got to warn people.
[02:35:54.528 --> 02:35:56.069]  We've got to stand up for America.
[02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:57.570]  We've got to fight for this country.
[02:35:57.670 --> 02:36:00.132]  I just love this country so much.
[02:36:01.212 --> 02:36:04.795]  I love my family so much and I can't believe we let it get to this.
[02:36:06.816 --> 02:36:08.358]  We've got to recognize the evil.
[02:36:08.398 --> 02:36:12.621]  We've got to recognize how criminal and sinister this government is and how illegitimate.
[02:36:12.881 --> 02:36:14.242]  Police officers, you hear me?
[02:36:14.282 --> 02:36:15.743]  You know what I'm saying, screw!
[02:36:16.623 --> 02:36:18.325]  And you need to stand up and speak out against it.
[02:36:18.365 --> 02:36:18.925]  What would happen?
[02:36:18.945 --> 02:36:23.108]  You know, they had a school three years ago in Louisiana.
[02:36:24.511 --> 02:36:32.355]  And they met at the kids, they put fences up, they frisked him, it was a rural area, they found a conservative area to let people do this, because they, you know, want to stop the drugs and the problems.
[02:36:33.035 --> 02:36:34.696]  It's actually the school importing it in.
[02:36:34.716 --> 02:36:42.279]  And they made him wear barcodes on an ID card, and a child, a young man, a 12 year old, learned how to read the barcode, which anybody can do.
[02:36:42.959 --> 02:36:49.642]  The size, the width of the stripes, you can, it's numbers, you can learn it.
[02:36:50.083 --> 02:36:53.124]  And he would walk up and tell people they're social security numbers, that's what it was.
[02:36:54.992 --> 02:37:09.178]  He got expelled for doing this, but he taught about 50 people about it, they started doing it, then they expelled like five more people, then it went from a third of the school refusing to wear the cards to about half, then teachers started refusing, and then the school got rid of it.
[02:37:10.779 --> 02:37:17.881]  Now that's how it works, and this is not inevitable, but you have to lead the charge.
[02:37:18.142 --> 02:37:24.044]  You have to go boycott H-E-B and Kroger and Safeway when they put thumb scanners in.
[02:37:25.109 --> 02:37:26.369]  Self-checkout lanes.
[02:37:26.489 --> 02:37:30.751]  Because they put in the self-checkout lane first, then they tear out all the lanes and make you thumb scan.
[02:37:30.791 --> 02:37:31.571]  It's already happening.
[02:37:31.591 --> 02:37:33.231]  Home Depot, they're all starting it.
[02:37:34.532 --> 02:37:37.873]  They put in self-checkers, and about six months later, they put in the thumb scanner.
[02:37:38.573 --> 02:37:40.754]  And they get rid of all the employees, make you do your own bagging.
[02:37:40.774 --> 02:37:42.374]  But that's a sub-reason why we're against it.
[02:37:42.714 --> 02:37:45.975]  We're really against this because of the taxation, the control, the tracking.
[02:37:47.516 --> 02:37:50.036]  If you go and you protest and you fight it now, we can stop it.
[02:37:50.076 --> 02:37:51.737]  You wait until it goes in everywhere, folks,
[02:37:52.949 --> 02:37:57.553]  Then the government's going to blow stuff up and claim there's a Christian right-wing group that's against the biometrics.
[02:37:58.033 --> 02:38:00.495]  And so if you're protesting it, you must be really with this group.
[02:38:00.535 --> 02:38:01.455]  That's going to be the plan there.
[02:38:01.475 --> 02:38:03.437]  I hate to give them ideas, but they already have the idea.
[02:38:03.477 --> 02:38:04.297]  I can tell where they're going.
[02:38:05.838 --> 02:38:08.900]  That's what they're going to do.
[02:38:08.940 --> 02:38:11.922]  You're against pro-abortion stuff?
[02:38:12.062 --> 02:38:14.064]  It turned out the feds have done all the bombings, folks.
[02:38:14.124 --> 02:38:14.924]  It's always the government.
[02:38:14.964 --> 02:38:20.008]  I think it was one guy actually did some that admitted he did, and we don't know if he's mind control or not.
[02:38:20.771 --> 02:38:22.512]  You want to demonize the pro-life movement?
[02:38:22.532 --> 02:38:23.632]  Blow stuff up, blame it on them.
[02:38:24.532 --> 02:38:26.353]  You want to demonize the Northern Ireland people?
[02:38:27.173 --> 02:38:28.473]  You blow stuff up and blame it on them.
[02:38:29.374 --> 02:38:32.094]  You want to go in and take over the West Bank?
[02:38:32.254 --> 02:38:35.095]  You found Hamas and have them do it.
[02:38:35.936 --> 02:38:37.176]  You want to take over Germany?
[02:38:37.216 --> 02:38:41.397]  You found neo-clan groups, neo-Nazi groups, have them kill people.
[02:38:41.457 --> 02:38:42.698]  It turned out it was the government doing it.
[02:38:42.758 --> 02:38:43.518]  That's official!
[02:38:45.238 --> 02:38:47.399]  So we've got to also educate folks that, hey,
[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:53.057]  You know, if we really become successful protesting this and boycotting it, you know, they're going to do this.
[02:38:55.381 --> 02:38:59.006]  But one of the best examples I have is the smallpox shot.
[02:38:59.807 --> 02:39:03.333]  Again, out of 20 major cities, 11 million people they wanted to vaccinate.
[02:39:04.706 --> 02:39:06.828]  All the health care, police and firemen and everybody.
[02:39:07.528 --> 02:39:10.871]  296 had taken it as of about a month ago, the LA Times reported.
[02:39:11.351 --> 02:39:13.352]  They already planned to vaccinate 11 million.
[02:39:13.512 --> 02:39:14.373]  They're all refusing.
[02:39:14.393 --> 02:39:18.136]  So now the feds have said, okay, you don't have to take the shot.
[02:39:18.516 --> 02:39:20.717]  Just when you sign up to give it, we'll pay you double.
[02:39:21.938 --> 02:39:27.282]  They were going to use you as useful idiots and have police and firemen and medical workers volunteer to do it.
[02:39:27.582 --> 02:39:28.583]  By the way, in Iraq,
[02:39:29.534 --> 02:39:34.178]  The people in the oil fields and the cops and everybody are going to get $20 a month.
[02:39:35.499 --> 02:39:40.703]  That's about one one-hundredth what Saddam paid people.
[02:39:40.723 --> 02:39:42.704]  $20 a month.
[02:39:43.525 --> 02:39:45.106]  Say one one-hundredth, what was the story?
[02:39:45.146 --> 02:39:46.707]  I'll dig the story out and read it probably in the next segment.
[02:39:46.727 --> 02:39:48.509]  I've got to dig it out, I've got to hear it.
[02:39:48.529 --> 02:39:51.771]  But it's like a fraction of what Saddam was paying them.
[02:39:51.791 --> 02:39:52.352]  $20 a month.
[02:39:52.392 --> 02:39:54.093]  It's going to be total slavery in that country.
[02:39:54.533 --> 02:39:55.374]  Starving to death.
[02:39:55.434 --> 02:39:55.794]  Working.
[02:39:56.014 --> 02:39:56.715]  $20 a month.
[02:39:56.975 --> 02:39:59.177]  A giant country of total slaves.
[02:39:59.921 --> 02:40:04.523]  And the news is like, oh, isn't our government nice to give them $20 a month for hard labor?
[02:40:05.343 --> 02:40:11.245]  In the factories, in the oil wells, and all of this, building pipelines, and his police, and his school teachers.
[02:40:14.146 --> 02:40:22.149]  I mean, what's... folks... They're mowing people down at protests who don't even fire at the Marines.
[02:40:22.935 --> 02:40:24.316]  They're just slaughtering children.
[02:40:24.536 --> 02:40:28.239]  It's Tiananmen Square every day, and I've got to watch these neocons on TV.
[02:40:28.619 --> 02:40:30.641]  Chris Matthews now worshipping Bush!
[02:40:30.661 --> 02:40:31.822]  Doesn't that tell you something?
[02:40:34.483 --> 02:40:41.509]  They're setting up a fascistic slave system, and the Republicans and the Democrats are all in it together, enslaving you and your family.
[02:40:41.869 --> 02:40:42.890]  You have got to stand up.
[02:40:42.910 --> 02:40:43.990]  You have got to speak out.
[02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:45.652]  You've got to get involved.
[02:40:46.392 --> 02:40:47.833]  You've got to stand up for this country.
[02:40:48.554 --> 02:40:49.675]  And you've got to do it now.
[02:40:49.715 --> 02:40:51.476]  They're trying to pass hate crimes legislation.
[02:40:52.119 --> 02:40:53.840]  But it's just like the smallpox shot.
[02:40:54.261 --> 02:41:02.926]  The truth was out on that, grassroots, the people refused, and now the government launching a smallpox attack, which they were planning to do, guaranteed, has been stalled.
[02:41:03.387 --> 02:41:12.613]  So now they're going to have top-off 2, a national terror drill, where they don't tell you they're doing a drill, they announce it, and then months later have it, but don't tell people locally on the news and announce it as if it's real.
[02:41:13.594 --> 02:41:21.259]  Quote with the media to make it more lifelike, terrorizing you, yelling fire in a theater, mind-controlling you, scaring you into submission.
[02:41:22.225 --> 02:41:23.527]  Folks, it's fight or flight time.
[02:41:24.287 --> 02:41:25.989]  I suggest we fight in the Info War.
[02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:27.351]  We get the word out.
[02:41:27.391 --> 02:41:28.512]  We stand against this evil.
[02:41:29.613 --> 02:41:30.254]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:30.795 --> 02:41:31.335]  Stay with me.
[02:41:31.996 --> 02:41:32.837]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:32.877 --> 02:41:34.439]  We shall prevail with God's help.
[02:41:37.022 --> 02:41:39.925]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.615 --> 02:41:41.897]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.117 --> 02:41:47.865]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:48.125 --> 02:41:53.392]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:53.672 --> 02:41:57.798]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:41:57.978 --> 02:42:01.779]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:02.039 --> 02:42:06.681]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.761 --> 02:42:09.541]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:42:09.821 --> 02:42:13.022]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.062 --> 02:42:14.883]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:42:15.443 --> 02:42:19.324]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and
[02:42:42.688 --> 02:42:42.908]  I think so.

[02:43:29.627 --> 02:43:33.731]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:44:37.125 --> 02:44:39.846]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:44:39.866 --> 02:44:43.787]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:46.428 --> 02:44:49.429]  Here's a Swiss Info story, media accused of aiding U.S.
[02:44:49.449 --> 02:44:50.270]  propaganda.
[02:44:50.490 --> 02:44:51.210]  It's not U.S.
[02:44:51.250 --> 02:44:53.791]  propaganda, it's globalists that have taken America over.
[02:44:55.191 --> 02:44:57.552]  It is one of the most famous images of the war in Iraq, a U.S.
[02:44:57.592 --> 02:45:06.015]  soldier scaling a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad and grabbing the stars and stripes over the black metal vestige of the ousted despot.
[02:45:06.792 --> 02:45:09.935]  But for Harper's Magazine publisher, John McArthur, that same image of the U.S.
[02:45:09.975 --> 02:45:15.040]  military victory is also indicative of a propaganda campaign being waged by the Bush administration.
[02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:18.222]  It was absolutely a photo op created by Bush.
[02:45:18.843 --> 02:45:24.708]  Bush's re-election campaign commercials, McArthur said in an interview, CNN, MSNBC, Fox swallowed it whole.
[02:45:26.310 --> 02:45:27.391]  In 92, McArthur wrote,
[02:45:28.801 --> 02:45:38.412]  Second Front Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War, a withering critique of government and media actions, he says, misled the public after Iraq's 90 invasion of Kuwait.
[02:45:38.472 --> 02:45:40.914]  Yeah, about how our government told them to invade.
[02:45:41.675 --> 02:45:45.359]  Look at this, additive free twin, five, outshines brother.
[02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:50.765]  It said that usually the other twin would beat the twin in mathematical and IQ tests.
[02:45:52.031 --> 02:46:02.529]  For a week they didn't feed the twin additives free food and he won and beat his brother substantially.
[02:46:02.569 --> 02:46:04.132]  It's the poison in the food, folks.
[02:46:05.306 --> 02:46:07.287]  Also, Bush fires warnings at U.S.
[02:46:07.387 --> 02:46:07.727]  enemies.
[02:46:07.927 --> 02:46:09.567]  Again, they're not enemies of us, they're enemies of the bankers.
[02:46:10.127 --> 02:46:14.589]  Crawford, Texas, saying the battle of Iraq is only one victory in a war on terror.
[02:46:14.929 --> 02:46:17.330]  And it still goes on, Bush said in his weekly radio address.
[02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:19.250]  Oh yes, it's never going to end.
[02:46:19.290 --> 02:46:20.791]  Your freedom is never going to come back.
[02:46:20.851 --> 02:46:22.651]  It's just that more and more liberty is going to be given up.
[02:46:22.751 --> 02:46:23.791]  It's going to keep you safe.
[02:46:25.292 --> 02:46:32.394]  These scattered cells of the terrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from daily intelligence that they continue to plot against free people.
[02:46:33.234 --> 02:46:35.235]  Yeah, and then it will be the right wing that's doing it.
[02:46:35.295 --> 02:46:39.557]  See, Homeland Security watching gun owners who work at gun shops.
[02:46:39.597 --> 02:46:42.019]  We just read the Atlanta Journal-Constitution article.
[02:46:42.619 --> 02:46:44.060]  Bush fires a warning at U.S.
[02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:45.861]  enemies, and it goes on.
[02:46:47.221 --> 02:46:49.142]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:46:50.183 --> 02:46:51.924]  But how much trouble we're in.
[02:46:53.665 --> 02:46:54.505]  And boy, it's serious.
[02:46:54.625 --> 02:46:56.246]  I'm sad for all those in the Midwest.
[02:46:56.266 --> 02:46:58.227]  Toronto kills at least 30 in three states.
[02:46:59.460 --> 02:47:01.281]  Missouri, we got hit really bad.
[02:47:01.341 --> 02:47:07.323]  Swarms of violent thunderstorms and tornadoes crashed through the nation's midsection, killing at least 30 people in Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee.
[02:47:08.103 --> 02:47:15.706]  Sorry for that, but, uh, I mean, they should have a five-day waiting period on tornadoes, you know, because they do that on guns, and what about car wrecks?
[02:47:15.746 --> 02:47:17.047]  The point is, none of us are safe.
[02:47:17.347 --> 02:47:21.588]  We never know when our number's up, so we might as well stand on what's right today and not be cowards.
[02:47:23.809 --> 02:47:24.730]  Uh, it goes on and on.
[02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:25.390]  Here, U.S.
[02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:27.431]  makes emergency payments to Iraq workers.
[02:47:27.451 --> 02:47:27.731]  The U.S.
[02:47:28.627 --> 02:47:36.253]  Stepped up efforts Sunday to return Iraq to work, offering public sector workers across the board emergency pay of $20 for a month's work.
[02:47:36.653 --> 02:47:39.915]  Taking steps to bring order to the oil sector.
[02:47:39.935 --> 02:47:41.216]  $20 a month, man!
[02:47:41.837 --> 02:47:43.338]  Man, that's freedom, isn't it?
[02:47:44.078 --> 02:47:48.802]  Hump that oil to foreign countries, let the globalists sell it, and you're going to get $20 a month.
[02:47:48.882 --> 02:47:50.503]  Man, that sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[02:47:51.384 --> 02:47:52.465]  Doesn't that sound good?
[02:47:52.845 --> 02:47:54.146]  You don't like it, we'll shoot you!
[02:47:55.245 --> 02:47:55.885]  I'm out of time.
[02:47:55.905 --> 02:47:57.286]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:47:57.326 --> 02:47:58.466]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:47:58.506 --> 02:48:01.348]  A lot of other news we didn't have time to cover.
[02:48:01.368 --> 02:48:04.369]  People getting arrested for shooting rattlesnakes that were trying to attack them.
[02:48:06.570 --> 02:48:08.011]  Political correctness run amok.
