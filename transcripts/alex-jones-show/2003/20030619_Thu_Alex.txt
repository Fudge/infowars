[00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:05.878]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.121]  Big Brother.
[00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:15.862]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:17.703]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:19.103]  You want answers?
[00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:20.204]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:29.723]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:46.830]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:57.377]  Hard to believe that it is already Thursday, the 19th of June, 2003.
[00:00:57.417 --> 00:00:59.778]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:07.621]  We have the lawyer for the original plaintiff in Roe v. Wade.
[00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:24.380]  Coming on the show in the second hour to talk about, well, attempting to force the Neocons and the Neocon Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade and stop any further killing.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.543]  There's already been 54 million children murdered in this country.
[00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:33.224]  And you can rationalize all day long
[00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:41.711]  You can try to make excuses all you want, but it is murder, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll be discussing that in this historical case.
[00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:52.280]  In the third hour, I've got one of these rock stars coming on who is against the war and the lies and the propaganda of the New World Order.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.921]  He's associated with Greg Palast.
[00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:02.148]  And their television blitz, Ads with a Conscience, we'll be discussing that in the third hour.
[00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:09.037]  A bunch of news from around the world, but I also want to cover a couple stories I never got to yesterday.
[00:02:09.217 --> 00:02:11.040]  One of them is Zacharias Moussaoui.
[00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:16.449]  Saying that the government had prior knowledge of the attacks when he wants to address Congress.
[00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.430]  Also, Senator Orrin Hatch takes aim at illegal downloading.
[00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.011]  Wants the government to have a backdoor into your computer to have a hack system running.
[00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.972]  Total violation of every canon of a free society.
[00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:35.095]  Had a Newsmax story I never got to that has quotes out of UNESCO's founding documents that Bush has just signed on to.
[00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:39.976]  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.681]  Where they say the family must be destroyed.
[00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:52.784]  Now I have the Calhoun Reader, the desk reference for those going to be social workers at the University of Texas, and they have this at many other universities.
[00:02:53.204 --> 00:03:05.889]  It's the standard textbook, the Calhoun Reader, where they say the family must be destroyed, that the family belongs to the age of barbarism, that their job is to destroy the family.
[00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:14.325]  Now how could any of you have your kids in the public school and make excuses when they admit it's about destroying the family?
[00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:19.708]  And how could Bush sign back onto an organization that Ronald Reagan got us out of?
[00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.811]  When Charlotte Isserby was the head of policy at the Department of Education.
[00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:32.396]  And of course they've implemented all the plans in it, but now they're signing back onto it to give it more funding.
[00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:36.278]  So that's coming up early in this hour as well.
[00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.922]  Also, Bush threatens Iran with actions to halt its nuclear ambitions.
[00:03:44.184 --> 00:03:44.964]  Think about this.
[00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:51.268]  Now, they said, the neocons said they were going to invade Iran, Syria, Iraq, North Korea, and now they're going to do it preemptively.
[00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:53.129]  World War III, folks.
[00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.350]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.692]  North Korea makes explicit threat.
[00:03:56.752 --> 00:03:59.293]  Regime warns of immediate physical retaliation.
[00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:00.814]  In the event of a U.S.
[00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:04.957]  blockade, Howell appears to shrug off the statement.
[00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:10.097]  Also, Minister warns of Euro Vote Civil War.
[00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.979]  Eighth night of unrest in Iran, encouraged by the U.S.
[00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.560]  Not by the U.S., by the bankers.
[00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:23.683]  And we will continue also with the covert war in Iran.
[00:04:23.703 --> 00:04:26.824]  And we'll get into the U.S.
[00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.125]  options for North Korea run from bad to worse.
[00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:41.659]  And we'll get into panel probing September 11th, request of documents, and of course what Zachariah Smith-Sally said, DARPA has a new brain interface system they want to create for the military with the microchips.
[00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.460]  This is from Defense Science Office.
[00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:54.669]  It's all coming up, big show today also, Camp X-Ray Father, Anger at Execution Plan, Haxel Band for 18 and under in the UK and Ireland.
[00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:03.511]  And of course, now it turns out that Ritalin is highly addictive and causes drug abuse later in life.
[00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.213]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:04.914]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:05.576]  Big show.
[00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:06.037]  Stay with us.
[00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:12.199]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.861]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:15.782]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:05:16.043 --> 00:05:21.227]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:26.071]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:35.019]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.659]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.901]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:47.803]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:05:48.143 --> 00:05:52.165]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:12.051]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.657]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:21.203]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:22.585]  The New World Order.
[00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:28.585]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:35.570]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.752]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:38.112 --> 00:06:39.073]  Homeland Security.
[00:06:39.273 --> 00:06:40.054]  Executive orders.
[00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:41.095]  Force vaccination.
[00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:48.540]  The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:54.105]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:12.618]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:07:12.778 --> 00:07:17.163]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:21.808]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:07:21.988 --> 00:07:24.951]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:29.892]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:07:30.152 --> 00:07:34.054]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:36.674]  And the aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:40.855]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:07:41.076 --> 00:07:46.237]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:49.438]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:07:49.578 --> 00:07:51.438]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:56.340]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call toll-free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.

[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.240]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:08:08.078 --> 00:08:13.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.802]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:27.407]  Alright, my friends, it's Thursday, the 19th of June, 2003.
[00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:32.467]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:38.694]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:08:40.717 --> 00:08:42.459]  And we do have the lawyer.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.743]  Who is representing the woman who was the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade.
[00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:56.848]  She's now a Christian and is against abortion and has a right to have the case reopened by the Supreme Court.
[00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:57.809]  That's in the second hour.
[00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:03.612]  In the third hour, we'll be talking about what some of the left-wingers are doing.
[00:09:04.453 --> 00:09:07.595]  Starting to wake up to the New World Order and the real paradigm.
[00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:11.171]  So you'll want to stay with us for that.
[00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:13.914]  Of course, we'll have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:17.317]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:09:17.897 --> 00:09:26.486]  I want to get into UNESCO saying their job is to destroy the family, the UN group that Bush just signed back onto.
[00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:38.959]  I also want to get into what Orrin Hatch wants to do with your computers, having the government having a backdoor into all your computers to destroy them whenever and however they wish.
[00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:49.948]  Absolute violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the government even says it will violate its own hacking laws, but they're going to go ahead and change those, and Hatch just isn't talking about this.
[00:09:50.008 --> 00:09:54.151]  A bill's been proposed, I saw it last year, to do this.
[00:09:54.831 --> 00:10:04.837]  And really the big news is that the neocons, PNAC, the Project for a New American Century, the think tank founded in 96 by Bush's cabinet, in waiting
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.325]  Said they want World War III, global domination, global empire.
[00:10:10.365 --> 00:10:11.366]  They used these terms.
[00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:12.728]  A new world order.
[00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:16.913]  They called it imperial mobilization in another paper.
[00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:19.396]  They said they needed terrorist attacks.
[00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:24.683]  Large attacks on the scale of Pearl Harbor or larger to get us behind these endless wars.
[00:10:26.132 --> 00:10:34.615]  Well, now the globalists have gone into Iraq publicly to get the oil and to have Iraq as a military base to launch into Syria and Iran, and now they're doing it!
[00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.776]  Now they're saying they're going to do it.
[00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:44.799]  And now they're trying to push the psychopaths in North Korea into striking us first so they have a pretext to get us into World War III.
[00:10:45.814 --> 00:11:05.759]  And people will, in a primitive fashion, will shift into mindless groupthink, will worship the government during this World War III period, and will willingly give up their liberties en masse, unless we expose who the terrorists are, and how they've set this thing up, and point people their own public documents where the globalists planned all of this.
[00:11:06.719 --> 00:11:10.940]  They just know that most of you don't read white papers by prestigious think tanks.
[00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:14.668]  But more Americans are beginning to learn of PNAC.
[00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:29.075]  I've been on liberal and conservative shows from Louisiana to Oklahoma to New York to California to Idaho to Florida in the last week or two and everybody's calling in bringing up PNAC to me.
[00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:36.139]  So there is an awakening taking place to the confessions of these criminals.
[00:11:37.256 --> 00:11:38.117]  And that's what it is.
[00:11:38.177 --> 00:12:00.168]  To premeditatedly say, we need terrorist attacks against America, to get the people behind a war for global empire, to get the national resources, and then to come out and say that it's not about national resources, that it's not about global power, that it's not about weapon sales, is a fraud and is a lie and is a massive racketeering conspiracy.
[00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:01.749]  And it's public.
[00:12:02.992 --> 00:12:07.654]  And now Bush threatens Iran with action to halt its nuclear ambitions.
[00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:13.857]  North Korea makes explicit threat to nuke us.
[00:12:14.177 --> 00:12:14.957]  It's all coming up.
[00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:17.758]  I didn't want to have to do this on the air, but I'm going to do it.
[00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:28.663]  And I know there's no way to address all the people that are doing this, but I'd have to do that on 20 shows to reach the entire audience, because people tune in at different times.
[00:12:29.303 --> 00:12:31.324]  The whole audience isn't obviously there at one time.
[00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:38.840]  You know, I produce documentary films, and I tell people they can make copies for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.443]  That means you can make copies of my videos to hand about to friends and family.
[00:12:44.424 --> 00:12:46.266]  And nobody else that I know of does this.
[00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:50.629]  I do this because I really do care, I want to wake this country up, I want to defeat the New World Order.
[00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:58.435]  And because I do that, I don't sell as many videotapes, which is my main source of funding for my staff and what we do, and funds to produce more films in the future.
[00:12:59.668 --> 00:13:03.449]  And to have cameras and computers and editing systems and all of that.
[00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:15.251]  And when I found out that a major Christian organization would only buy like 20 of my videos every couple months.
[00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:22.492]  And I knew they were advertising in major newspapers and magazines and I kind of ignored it.
[00:13:22.712 --> 00:13:26.193]  I instinctively knew they must be bootlegging them and making copies.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:42.302]  And then I found out because I was mailed... I get mailed copies of videos in different jackets and different sleeves and different stickers saying this video is in high quality, there's a dead spot on it, return it.
[00:13:42.963 --> 00:13:43.683]  Send me another.
[00:13:43.703 --> 00:13:46.403]  And I have to contact them and say, uh, where'd you buy this?
[00:13:46.483 --> 00:13:47.563]  Oh, I bought it from this person.
[00:13:47.603 --> 00:13:49.584]  Well, we didn't make this video tape.
[00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:56.785]  So I ordered from the individual, had someone out of another state order from them, and yes, it was a bootlegged video.
[00:13:58.027 --> 00:13:59.247]  I'm sick and tired of it.
[00:13:59.307 --> 00:14:01.768]  I'm going to start taking legal action against people that do it.
[00:14:02.328 --> 00:14:09.250]  And if the person doesn't take their ads out of newspapers and magazines, I'm going to talk about them on the air.
[00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:11.871]  I'm not putting up with this anymore.
[00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:14.532]  I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:14:15.372 --> 00:14:18.513]  Especially when it's people that have a lot of money.
[00:14:21.054 --> 00:14:25.235]  I mean, what's really funny is this individual, this group, will order videos
[00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:47.948]  and say oh can we pay you later we don't have the money and there they are and I've talked to people that have advertised these publications selling guaranteed thousands of videos more than I'm selling and they are then doing this to me it makes me so angry because with that money I could hire more people get other
[00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:56.473]  Other editors to work on other jobs, have better computers, have better cameras, have a bigger budget, and affect more change and save this country.
[00:14:57.874 --> 00:15:04.337]  You see, it isn't good enough to these people that I say make copies of my films for non-profit, educational, or for self-purposes.
[00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.018]  That's not enough.
[00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:13.762]  And I want to commend those that have gotten the films, have made copies, that have aired them on AXS TV, that have gotten them out to people.
[00:15:13.982 --> 00:15:14.882]  I want to commend you.
[00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:17.784]  But anybody making bootlegs of my videos
[00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:20.589]  And selling them, report it to me immediately.
[00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:22.330]  Because I'm going to start taking legal action.
[00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.113]  Because I am sick and tired of the deception out there.
[00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:32.458]  And I tell you, a lot of these so-called Christians are the ones that will stab you in the back in a minute.
[00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:37.502]  Because they're not Christians, they're a bunch of profiteers, manipulators.
[00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:41.505]  And I for one am sick and tired of it.
[00:15:42.265 --> 00:15:44.507]  I don't want to get off into some big discussion of it, but
[00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:52.035]  I really do hope the listeners will get my original high-quality videos and of course Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:57.436]  I hope that you'll get it from InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or from 888-253-3139.
[00:15:57.476 --> 00:15:58.476]  These are great videos.
[00:15:58.496 --> 00:16:01.637]  So of course people want to rip them off.
[00:16:01.657 --> 00:16:01.717]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:16:16.565 --> 00:16:20.888]  I know a lot of you have been given copies of copies of copies of my videos and they're not very high quality.
[00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:36.640]  If you're going to make copies of that fifth generation video, why not get the originals from me, support our cause, help us produce more films in the future, and at the same time make a high quality second generation copy?
[00:16:38.504 --> 00:16:40.686]  Because we do need your support here, folks.
[00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:49.272]  We've had a lot of growing pains, and we have just incredibly insane expenses for what we do.
[00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:52.294]  And I don't do what the other hosts do.
[00:16:52.354 --> 00:17:00.220]  I don't get up here and harangue you for contributions, and harangue you for this and that, because I've recognized it so many times in the past.
[00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:06.125]  You know, I don't want to be seen as a Robert Tilton or something, but I never talked about this.
[00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:14.455]  You know, our AM and FM affiliates pick us up, and then they get part of the commercials, and we get part of the commercials in a network arrangement.
[00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.259]  But when it comes to shortwave, I pay for it.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.983]  I pay $7,000, $8,000 a month.
[00:17:23.403 --> 00:17:24.164]  I pay for it.
[00:17:24.704 --> 00:17:27.026]  And some months, we don't even make a profit.
[00:17:27.066 --> 00:17:28.347]  We go into the red.
[00:17:28.968 --> 00:17:30.309]  I've never talked about that on the air.
[00:17:31.061 --> 00:17:32.762]  And it makes me very mad.
[00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:52.212]  We do this to have an international outreach to reach the world with the truth and I do this and I don't talk about it ever, ever on the air and there are fat cat Christian organizations stealing from me and they will pay me back or they will be exposed on the air.
[00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:54.954]  Bottom line.
[00:17:56.635 --> 00:17:56.995]  Because
[00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:00.623]  You know, I am just so sick and tired of it.
[00:18:00.883 --> 00:18:14.514]  I am fighting as hard as I can to defeat the New World Order, and these videos are mini printing presses, and that's why I authorize the listeners to make copies of them, and I want you to, and I want you to get them out to opinion makers.
[00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:27.545]  So please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get The Road to Tyranny, get The Masters of Terror, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, get my book Dissent into Tyranny,
[00:18:28.197 --> 00:18:34.099]  Go sign up at Infowars.net for great internet service to help us pay the bandwidth cost that I never talk about.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.860]  And help us reach out to the American people.
[00:18:39.081 --> 00:18:39.441]  Alright?
[00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:49.604]  I mean, who else, when you go buy a minority report, does it say on the movie jacket, please make copies for non-profit educational purposes?
[00:18:49.644 --> 00:18:50.145]  No, it doesn't.
[00:18:50.645 --> 00:18:51.145]  I do that.
[00:18:52.037 --> 00:18:53.658]  That's not enough for these slimeballs.
[00:18:53.998 --> 00:18:58.220]  Well, I know it's enough for you, and I appreciate you out there, but we do need your support.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:13.747]  So go buy all my videos, and buy my book, and make copies of the films, and do the right thing, because 90% of those that see the films are waking up, and are having the blinders taken off of their eyes.
[00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.988]  And that, my friends, is very, very exciting.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.381]  So please get the films.
[00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:21.841]  They're $25.95 a piece.
[00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:22.961]  $20 if you order three or more.
[00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:23.802]  InfoWars.com or Net.
[00:19:23.842 --> 00:19:24.022]  Or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:24.242]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:19:24.262 --> 00:19:27.864]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:19:51.272 --> 00:19:54.155]  Take action now, folks.
[00:19:54.475 --> 00:19:55.135]  Get the films.
[00:19:55.155 --> 00:19:58.678]  All right, I'll come back and tell you about the World War III that a lot of us are setting up.
[00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:04.003]  UNESCO saying that your children must be broken up from the family.
[00:20:04.063 --> 00:20:05.064]  The family's the enemy.
[00:20:05.484 --> 00:20:06.685]  There's no doubt about their goals.
[00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:07.306]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:08.982 --> 00:20:10.583]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:08.390]  Gold.
[00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.031]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:16.374]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:16.554 --> 00:22:20.396]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:22.637]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:24.978]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:25.118 --> 00:22:32.602]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:32.662 --> 00:22:33.343]  I don't know.
[00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:48.580]  Are you a diabetic?
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.241]  Do you know someone who is?
[00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:52.523]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money.
[00:23:13.701 --> 00:23:19.703]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.

[00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:55.516]  800-419-2335.
[00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:55.576]  800-419-2335.
[00:24:18.428 --> 00:24:20.389]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones back live.
[00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:25.092]  And one more note about the people bootlegging and selling my videos, ripping me off.
[00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.233]  You know, I'm not going to talk about any of these people on the air.
[00:24:29.554 --> 00:24:31.075]  I'm just going to sue them.
[00:24:32.822 --> 00:24:34.304]  And, you know, I've sued people before.
[00:24:34.344 --> 00:24:42.871]  I don't make a big deal or public deal about that, but on other issues, I'm not going to sit here and take this type of garbage from people.
[00:24:43.512 --> 00:24:45.734]  Their deception, their lies, their corruption.
[00:24:47.575 --> 00:24:58.085]  But I am certainly just angry, angry about that type of stuff, because I have worked so hard to fight the New World Order.
[00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:02.606]  And so many of our problems are in the so-called alternative media.
[00:25:02.946 --> 00:25:05.968]  But that's just the nature of the world as things get more and more corrupt.
[00:25:06.388 --> 00:25:09.490]  Let me cover what UNESCO had to say, and this is important.
[00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.231]  We've got to expose UNESCO.
[00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:17.235]  It says, strangle this monster in its crib.
[00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:22.299]  That's the headline by Phil Burnen, Newsmax.
[00:25:22.379 --> 00:25:24.400]  Now listen to the propaganda in this article.
[00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:30.430]  Unless Congress regains its modicum of sanity, they're not insane.
[00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.230]  They know what they're doing.
[00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.111]  They want slaves.
[00:25:33.152 --> 00:25:34.313]  They're not insane, Phil.
[00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:48.043]  Unless Congress regains a modicum of sanity, the United States of America is about to rejoin an organization dedicated to the destruction of the last vestiges of Christian civilization.
[00:25:49.016 --> 00:25:59.520]  For reasons inexplicable, the most sensible Americans, in September 2002, an otherwise sensible President George W. Bush, told the United Nations that the U.S.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:05.642]  will rejoin the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO.
[00:26:07.642 --> 00:26:14.585]  A wild-eyed bunch of President Reagan abandoned in 1984, noting that it was utterly corrupt and that the U.S.
[00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:17.226]  had no business being a member of such a group.
[00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:17.966]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:26:19.227 --> 00:26:38.261]  I was on a talk show last night with Charlotte Isserby in Oklahoma City and she pointed out that she tried to get us out of it, but that they only got out of it in name and stopped funding the UN itself, but the Department of Education funded the exact UNESCO handbooks for the schools and the administration and for the National Education Association's policies.
[00:26:40.643 --> 00:26:42.124]  So it's really always been here.
[00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:49.350]  Reagan just tried to get out of it, and it at least didn't fund the UN side of it.
[00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:56.573]  To Reagan's credit, but of course George W. Bush, the New World Order promoter, like his daddy that he is.
[00:26:56.593 --> 00:26:57.893]  I mean, listen to this article.
[00:26:57.933 --> 00:26:59.854]  An otherwise sensible President Bush.
[00:26:59.894 --> 00:27:04.695]  You mean sensible when he tried to block arming the pilots when Barbara Boxer was for it?
[00:27:05.215 --> 00:27:08.376]  You mean the sensible President who's for blanket amnesty and open borders?
[00:27:08.817 --> 00:27:12.818]  You mean the sensible President that blocked Dan Burton's committee investigating Pardongate?
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.804]  George Bush protecting the Clinton, pardoning the convicted cocaine dealers and money launderers?
[00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:28.550]  You mean the George Bush that says he's going to re-sign the Clinton assault weapons ban and add a bunch of bans, including a ban on all semi-automatic shotguns?
[00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:30.352]  You mean that sensible, President?
[00:27:30.752 --> 00:27:35.396]  Come on, neocons, quit acting like he's some conservative or something.
[00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:36.656]  He's a New World Order puppet.
[00:27:38.518 --> 00:27:42.561]  And it says most Americans are blissfully ignorant of the insidious nature of the
[00:27:43.402 --> 00:27:44.544]  Well, where does Bush go?
[00:27:44.604 --> 00:27:46.066]  He goes to Bohemian Grove.
[00:27:59.222 --> 00:28:00.162]  They worship the trees.
[00:28:00.202 --> 00:28:01.203]  I got them on videotape.
[00:28:01.223 --> 00:28:02.123]  They worship Moloch.
[00:28:02.183 --> 00:28:02.803]  I mean, come on.
[00:28:03.204 --> 00:28:04.684]  Promotes abortion worldwide.
[00:28:04.744 --> 00:28:07.145]  Seeks to capture control of schools and school children.
[00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:11.287]  And is in the process of transforming national and privately owned property in the U.S.
[00:28:11.567 --> 00:28:13.427]  and elsewhere into its greedy hands.
[00:28:15.268 --> 00:28:23.051]  It says, consider this, Jim, from UNESCO's Own Policy Report, a ten-part series for teachers, published in 1949.
[00:28:23.691 --> 00:28:25.952]  Under the title, Towards World Understanding,
[00:28:26.756 --> 00:28:35.523]  Asserted that quote, one of the chief aims of education today should be to prepare boys and girls to take an active part in the creation of a world society.
[00:28:36.263 --> 00:28:42.928]  But government schools must stamp out love of country and the family must be viewed as the enemy.
[00:28:43.609 --> 00:28:45.110]  As long as children read
[00:28:45.774 --> 00:28:50.996]  Poisoned air of nationalism, education world mindedness can produce only rather precarious results.
[00:28:51.617 --> 00:28:57.279]  As we have pointed out, it is frequently the family that infects the child with extreme nationalism.
[00:28:57.659 --> 00:29:05.463]  The school should therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes that favor jingoism.
[00:29:06.835 --> 00:29:13.921]  So there, they call the family a disease, they say it's got to be gotten rid of, and I have the Calhoun Reader used at UT today.
[00:29:13.941 --> 00:29:21.266]  I don't know about your college, but it's the big standard desk reference for people going to be school teachers or social workers.
[00:29:21.366 --> 00:29:24.129]  It says, the family must be eradicated.
[00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:28.412]  It belongs to the age of barbarism, the state for the future.
[00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:31.406]  Right out of Brave New World, right out of 1984.
[00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:35.789]  Of course, Huxley's brother was Julian Huxley, the author of 1984.
[00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.571]  His brother later became, excuse me, the author of Brave New World.
[00:29:40.672 --> 00:29:47.477]  Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, became the first Secretary General and Director of UNESCO in 1946.
[00:29:49.398 --> 00:29:52.220]  So, Brave New World's what they want to do.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.282]  Drug the kids, all this garbage, it's what they're doing.
[00:29:55.302 --> 00:29:57.123]  We'll be right back and we'll cover World War III.
[00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:01.497]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.517 --> 00:30:05.259]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:14.424]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:30:15.124 --> 00:30:19.526]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most exceptional.
[00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:21.207]  But your business doesn't have to.
[00:30:21.247 --> 00:30:23.608]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[00:30:47.238 --> 00:30:48.339]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:58.304]  You know that the lady who was known as Roe is now an older woman and a Christian and believes that what happened
[00:30:59.002 --> 00:30:59.603]  We're good to go.
[00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:18.555]  Who's brought forward the new brief of the Supreme Court in the next hour.
[00:31:18.735 --> 00:31:21.358]  We have several other guests as well coming up in a few minutes.
[00:31:21.938 --> 00:31:25.641]  Bush threatens Iran with action to hold its nuclear ambitions.
[00:31:26.082 --> 00:31:27.783]  North Korea makes explicit threat.
[00:31:27.843 --> 00:31:30.325]  Regime warns of immediate physical retaliation.
[00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:31.526]  In the event of a U.S.
[00:31:31.566 --> 00:31:34.249]  blockade, Powell appears to shrug off the statement.
[00:31:34.729 --> 00:31:36.251]  Oh yeah, the North Koreans attack us.
[00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:39.614]  They'll get to get us into a war and poses our saviors during this
[00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:41.570]  World War III.
[00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:47.493]  When Bush told us the new war would last a hundred years, multiple generations, he wasn't lying to us.
[00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:52.015]  How do we stop all these preemptive attacks on countries?
[00:31:53.255 --> 00:31:58.538]  And of course, once they overthrow the thugs, they'll just put in thugs that are as bad or worse in many cases.
[00:31:59.979 --> 00:32:01.560]  And of course, we're going to take your calls.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.761]  The toll-free number to join us on-air is 800-259-9231.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.361]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:32:09.481 --> 00:32:11.583]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:32:11.603 --> 00:32:11.643]  800-259-9231.
[00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:27.093]  And that your calls and that news about World War 3 are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:33.938]  Right now, I want to bring one of our great sponsors up with great products, with a couple of new, wonderful offers and new products.
[00:32:34.398 --> 00:32:36.700]  And that's Jim Shepherd from New Millennium Concepts.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:47.028]  Your body is 70% water, and you're being poisoned through the water with herbicides, pesticides, chlorine, all the other trash, MBTE.
[00:32:47.408 --> 00:32:48.869]  Why not take control of your life?
[00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:51.051]  Why not take the Big Berkey Challenge?
[00:32:51.778 --> 00:32:57.860]  For the Murky Light Challenge and drink clear water for a month, then try to drink tap water.
[00:32:58.921 --> 00:33:01.102]  Believe me, it'll be a life-changing experience.
[00:33:01.202 --> 00:33:02.582]  Water is life!
[00:33:03.363 --> 00:33:04.823]  Jim, good to have you on the show today.
[00:33:05.023 --> 00:33:06.404]  Hey, it's good to be on, Alex.
[00:33:06.424 --> 00:33:07.244]  How are you today?
[00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:08.785]  Oh, I'm doing alright, Jim.
[00:33:09.065 --> 00:33:09.345]  Good.
[00:33:09.745 --> 00:33:12.406]  Alex, we've got a couple announcements to make.
[00:33:13.567 --> 00:33:19.549]  You know, a lot of your listeners and callers have been calling us up saying, when are you going to get the fluoride reduction filters
[00:33:20.505 --> 00:33:24.548]  Uh, available for the, uh, uh, for the black Berkey filter elements.
[00:33:24.708 --> 00:33:25.528]  We've been working on it.
[00:33:25.568 --> 00:33:34.674]  We had one little glitch that we had to fix, but, uh, we're here to announce that, uh, we've come out with the fluoride and arsenic reduction filters.
[00:33:35.694 --> 00:33:40.777]  Uh, that was the one area that, uh, we just couldn't get the volume in on the black Berkey filter elements.
[00:33:40.797 --> 00:33:45.120]  You get a couple hundred gallons and then we start getting an analyte breakthrough on those filter elements.
[00:33:46.284 --> 00:33:58.610]  Let me stop you, Jim, because for those that don't know, they put fluoride in the water, sodium fluoride, not the good fluoride, calcium fluoride, but sodium fluoride as a byproduct of aluminum plants from World War II.
[00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:02.692]  They had this toxic waste, so they started putting it in the water, claiming it was good for us.
[00:34:02.752 --> 00:34:07.034]  It's been proven to cause sluggishness and brain damage and bone fractures.
[00:34:07.174 --> 00:34:10.616]  Mainstream, hundreds of major universities, absolute fact.
[00:34:11.303 --> 00:34:21.093]  Fluoride, you can, I mean, you know, it'll do thousands of gallons, cut out the bacteria, the herbicides, the pesticides, but fluoride is well known to go through basically everything.
[00:34:21.133 --> 00:34:22.754]  It's almost impossible to stop.
[00:34:23.215 --> 00:34:25.017]  No other filter even says they can do it.
[00:34:25.437 --> 00:34:33.946]  You've now got these special filters that will do that, and so I want to make it clear, this, the black murky is a revolutionary system.
[00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:37.108]  It cuts almost everything out but that fluoride.
[00:34:37.769 --> 00:34:39.370]  Why is fluoride so powerful?
[00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.391]  Why does it cut across almost any medium?
[00:34:42.052 --> 00:34:50.038]  Well, the reason why it's so difficult to extract, Alex, is because you need a large amount of media to extract a very little amount of fluoride.
[00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.780]  And that has been the problem.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.902]  That's why we just didn't get the results with the Black Berkey that we wanted.
[00:34:54.962 --> 00:35:01.207]  We put as much of that in there as we had room for, but we only got a couple hundred gallons of reduction out of it.
[00:35:03.243 --> 00:35:05.944]  So we really need to have something you can replace.
[00:35:06.024 --> 00:35:11.227]  And these are replaceable cartridges that when they're spent, then you throw them away and you get a new one.
[00:35:11.327 --> 00:35:15.529]  But your black Berkey filter element keeps on filtering water.
[00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:24.634]  And so the special that we're going to run, and this is going to be just through the end of this month.
[00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:27.095]  It's not going to extend beyond that.
[00:35:27.715 --> 00:35:31.117]  But for folks who have already bought a Berkey light,
[00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:40.646]  The set of two filters is $49 for the fluoride and arsenic reduction filters.
[00:35:41.746 --> 00:35:52.574]  And we're going to do a special where we're going to do four of them for those people who already have the filters.
[00:35:54.175 --> 00:35:55.335]  I'm figuring it right now.
[00:35:55.355 --> 00:35:56.076]  It's for $73.50.
[00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:03.957]  So in other words, on that second set, you're getting half off on that.
[00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:07.279]  And we're going to do that through the end of the month.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:14.584]  Now, we also have a special for people who do not have a Berkey Light system and want to go ahead and get one.
[00:36:15.564 --> 00:36:27.711]  You buy a Berkey Light, and with two PF2 filters, a set of two for $49, we'll go ahead and throw an extra set in there at absolutely no cost at all.
[00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:29.072]  So you'll get actually four
[00:36:30.378 --> 00:36:32.959]  PF2 filters for the price of two.
[00:36:33.499 --> 00:36:39.900]  Now, for those who don't understand, the fluoride filters go over the black murky filter.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.440]  Well, they actually screw onto the stem.
[00:36:43.061 --> 00:36:49.522]  And so the water is going to go through the black murky purifying elements first, and it's going to clean all the junk out of it.
[00:36:50.022 --> 00:36:55.363]  And then it's going to go through the post filters, and it's going to attack specifically the arsenic and the fluoride.
[00:36:56.218 --> 00:37:00.561]  And then it goes into the lower chamber that holds your purified water.
[00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:02.862]  So the filters go up on top of it?
[00:37:03.343 --> 00:37:04.223]  It's a post filter.
[00:37:04.243 --> 00:37:06.585]  Actually, they go on the stem.
[00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:11.768]  They screw on the stem of the filter elements, and they hang down in the lower chamber.
[00:37:12.629 --> 00:37:14.430]  Jim, I know you do exhaustive testing.
[00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:20.134]  How long will these post filters work to cut out the fluoride and the arsenic?
[00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:23.095]  OK, a set of two is going to go about 1,000 gallons.
[00:37:24.494 --> 00:37:32.318]  And so folks, you can determine how long they're going to last by how many times you're refilling your chamber each day.
[00:37:33.358 --> 00:37:41.782]  And for those who don't know, how many gallons do the big black murky filters do for the pathogenic bacteria, the chlorine, and all the rest of the garbage?
[00:37:41.902 --> 00:37:44.603]  Each one of those filters is going to do 2,000 gallons.
[00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:48.085]  And so you're going to have 4,000 gallons of filtration.
[00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:53.307]  And under normal use, they're going to last for two to four years.
[00:37:54.289 --> 00:37:56.877]  Uh, a set of two of them will.
[00:37:56.897 --> 00:37:58.442]  And if you're filling the chamber up...
[00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:00.807]  Uh, about three times a day.
[00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:02.248]  They're going to last for about two years.
[00:38:30.149 --> 00:38:34.050]  I know the Comanche Peak Power Plant's now been shut down in South Texas.
[00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.110]  Had a big crack in it.
[00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.570]  Hardly any news on that.
[00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.951]  I mean, this is, we're on the edge of this all the time.
[00:38:39.411 --> 00:38:43.151]  You've got potassium iodate, the best brand, medical core type, at a very low price.
[00:38:43.171 --> 00:38:47.912]  You've got portable sports bottle filters of the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going to find.
[00:38:48.812 --> 00:38:51.573]  How do folks call to take advantage of all these specials, Jim?
[00:38:52.273 --> 00:38:53.573]  Okay, they can reach us at 888-803-4438.
[00:38:59.426 --> 00:39:01.007]  Again, that's 888-803-4438.
[00:39:01.147 --> 00:39:08.551]  And Alex, there's one other special that I want to offer to your listeners.
[00:39:08.712 --> 00:39:12.013]  We only have 20 of these, so the first 20 are the ones who get it.
[00:39:12.814 --> 00:39:22.440]  As you know, we have the bug detector, which detects if somebody's placed a bug on your line or if somebody has picked up an extension and is listening in on your line.
[00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:26.382]  And the retail on those is $149.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.321]  We're good to go.
[00:39:43.268 --> 00:39:48.372]  And $27 value for $125 and we've got 20 of them that we're going to do that way.
[00:39:48.392 --> 00:39:48.512]  Okay.
[00:39:48.532 --> 00:39:48.612]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:48.632 --> 00:39:49.233]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:49.273 --> 00:39:51.875]  And folks, take advantage of the filters.
[00:40:01.022 --> 00:40:03.564]  And if you want, go check the prices of these at the stores.
[00:40:04.165 --> 00:40:06.907]  You're paying, in some cases, half of what you would.
[00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:11.371]  Jim is the big national distributor, and we're proud to have him as a sponsor.
[00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:15.814]  And I bought products that came from Jim through Middleman years ago.
[00:40:16.415 --> 00:40:19.777]  And I would suggest you take advantage of going to the source to get these.
[00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:22.479]  And the new Berkey Light is made in America, by the way.
[00:40:22.499 --> 00:40:23.240]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:26.202 --> 00:40:27.143]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[00:40:27.283 --> 00:40:28.184]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[00:40:28.264 --> 00:40:28.664]  God bless.
[00:40:28.684 --> 00:40:29.325]  God bless you, buddy.
[00:40:30.234 --> 00:40:30.774]  All right.
[00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:36.018]  Now, again, we have several guests coming up, and we're going to take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:40:36.078 --> 00:40:36.338]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:40:36.419 --> 00:40:37.980]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.801]  Now, I want to recap this briefly.
[00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:42.043]  Bush and his cabinet
[00:40:50.558 --> 00:41:01.883]  Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, in 96, before they were even talking about running for election, founded the neocon think tank, Project for a New American Century.
[00:41:02.303 --> 00:41:15.429]  And they penned essays, white papers, where they said, we need America to be attacked with a Pearl Harbor-style attack, or larger, by terrorists, for imperial mobilization to set up a new world order.
[00:41:16.471 --> 00:41:17.872]  And they said the attacks are needed.
[00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:20.414]  And they said it's going to be an endless war.
[00:41:21.514 --> 00:41:22.975]  We can get the natural resources.
[00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:24.276]  We can invade everybody.
[00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:25.517]  We can take over the world.
[00:41:25.577 --> 00:41:28.258]  We can set up a police state here domestically.
[00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:31.621]  As long as we're in a war, the people will support the government.
[00:41:33.402 --> 00:41:41.707]  They'll support the government while they take your pension funds, while they take the veterans' health care, while they take your guns, while they open the borders, while they do all of this.
[00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:44.188]  While they institute Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.562]  While they build giant prisons that they profiteer off of.
[00:41:49.642 --> 00:41:54.165]  They went into Iraq, paid off the Republican Guard, opposition imploded.
[00:41:54.185 --> 00:41:59.288]  Now they're setting up a dictatorship, taking over the free press, confiscating the guns.
[00:42:01.649 --> 00:42:06.812]  In the cities, the government will appoint 300 people who then vote for who the leader is.
[00:42:07.613 --> 00:42:11.715]  So I go out and tell my people who can vote, and they go vote for me.
[00:42:11.755 --> 00:42:12.536]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:42:13.752 --> 00:42:15.293]  And now that's not enough for them.
[00:42:15.373 --> 00:42:18.375]  All the lies about, oh, it's just Iraq.
[00:42:18.455 --> 00:42:20.036]  Oh, it's just the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:42:20.096 --> 00:42:22.877]  Oh, we don't have any plan to go into Syria or Iran.
[00:42:22.897 --> 00:42:26.459]  And they have their own documents saying they planned two years ago.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.581]  This is from the London Times.
[00:42:29.081 --> 00:42:33.423]  Bush threatens Iran with action to halt its nuclear ambitions.
[00:42:33.503 --> 00:42:39.667]  Now, Donald Rumsfeld gave them the reactors on the board of ABB, the Swiss company.
[00:42:41.102 --> 00:42:45.386]  As he was the bag man in 83, transferring the chemical and biologicals to Saddam.
[00:42:47.267 --> 00:42:56.274]  President Bush issued his darkest threat to Iran yesterday, saying that the world would not tolerate its nuclear ambitions, close quote.
[00:42:56.955 --> 00:43:05.081]  Days after infuriating Iran's ruling clerics by cheering demonstrations in Iran cities, Mr. Bush suggested the U.S.
[00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:09.325]  would act rather than allow Iraq's neighbor to develop a nuclear capability.
[00:43:09.918 --> 00:43:12.099]  Asked if he was going to stop Iran from building a bomb.
[00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:15.360]  Mr. Bush said it will be dangerous if they have a nuclear weapon.
[00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:24.144]  He said the international community must come together to make it clear to Iran that we will not tolerate the construction of nuclear weapons in Iran.
[00:43:24.204 --> 00:43:25.925]  Now, Iran denies that this is happening.
[00:43:25.945 --> 00:43:27.265]  They say it's for peaceful purposes.
[00:43:28.926 --> 00:43:33.628]  And US and British companies have helped give them the technology that they do have.
[00:43:34.381 --> 00:43:36.021]  Officials in Washington says the U.S.
[00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:37.922]  will not act unilaterally against Iran.
[00:43:37.942 --> 00:43:52.586]  Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush's communications director, told the Times that Iran was an issue for the world body, for the whole world, unlike the route to increase pressure against Iran would be through the U.N.
[00:43:52.746 --> 00:43:54.326]  Security Council, he said.
[00:43:56.087 --> 00:43:59.988]  So one likely route to increase pressure against Iran would be through the U.N.
[00:44:00.028 --> 00:44:00.728]  Security Council.
[00:44:00.768 --> 00:44:01.188]  Now Bush
[00:44:01.775 --> 00:44:12.543]  A couple weeks ago I was at the G8 meeting and the whole G8 said, yeah we're for you attacking Iran if need be to stop them producing nuclear weapons.
[00:44:14.724 --> 00:44:19.407]  But then you look at who's helped give them the systems that they can now claim are being used for nuclear weapons.
[00:44:19.447 --> 00:44:21.829]  Now I have no doubt that Iran is trying to produce a bomb.
[00:44:24.031 --> 00:44:25.972]  I have no doubt, in fact it's admitted,
[00:44:26.798 --> 00:44:29.219]  That North Korea has the bomb.
[00:44:29.399 --> 00:44:31.100]  But our government acts like they don't.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.401]  They've got to stop them from getting one.
[00:44:32.721 --> 00:44:34.081]  They had a bomb six years ago.
[00:44:35.282 --> 00:44:44.086]  Now, according to the Federation of American Scientists and the Associated Press, Pyongyang, North Korea, can produce 100 nuclear warheads a year.
[00:44:44.146 --> 00:44:50.148]  And China gave them the technology to perfect their intermediate-range missiles, some of which can hit the West Coast.
[00:44:52.009 --> 00:44:53.830]  And Alaska, they shoot them over the pole.
[00:44:57.009 --> 00:45:00.930]  And so now they've been enabled, they've been empowered, and the globalists don't care.
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:15.774]  In fact, by threatening to invade, and by Rumsfeld releasing his invasion plan of North Korea two months ago, now North Korea is freaking out, threatening everyone, massing troops.
[00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.875]  This is crazy, folks.
[00:45:18.895 --> 00:45:20.395]  This is a massive escalation.
[00:45:22.296 --> 00:45:29.979]  And boy, try criticizing the government when they're in the middle of a war with North Korea and Iran and Syria and they got a national draft in place.
[00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:43.603]  And of course terrorists will conveniently carry out attacks, the government will be doing that of course, per the Northwoods plan to get everyone behind the war during this period.
[00:45:45.789 --> 00:45:49.551]  So, uh, in Paris, two women and one man set themselves on fire.
[00:45:49.591 --> 00:46:02.096]  They were among 100 demonstrators who had gathered near the headquarters of the DST to counter espionage service, demanding the release of a leader of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which was the target of a police sweep on Tuesday.
[00:46:02.536 --> 00:46:08.339]  Self-ventilations were also attempted by Iranian protesters in Hamburg and other German cities.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.361]  You know, it takes a lot for somebody to set themselves on fire.
[00:46:14.378 --> 00:46:23.143]  And I don't think it's a good thing to do, but you talk about desperation to do something like this, and some are injured, others are dying from this.
[00:46:24.163 --> 00:46:26.505]  There's now intolations taking place in Iraq.
[00:46:26.625 --> 00:46:29.946]  They know if they shoot somebody, that'll be turned against them.
[00:46:31.407 --> 00:46:34.729]  And so they're just setting themselves on fire and committing suicide.
[00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:45.457]  Because they're in so much pain, they're so enslaved after 12 years of bombardment and genocide and DU, salting of the earth with depleted uranium.
[00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:50.561]  And they've made all this a left-right debate, all the liberals are against the war.
[00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:55.905]  No, Chuckie Schumer and Hillary Clinton and all the big socialists and Dianne Feinstein were for the war.
[00:46:57.006 --> 00:46:58.647]  Just like they're for UNESCO.
[00:46:58.687 --> 00:47:01.469]  Just like Bush is for UNESCO and the UN taking over our schools.
[00:47:01.789 --> 00:47:03.611]  Just like Bush is for the assault weapons ban.
[00:47:03.831 --> 00:47:05.192]  Just like Bush is for open borders.
[00:47:06.067 --> 00:47:09.548]  They have all these neocons on the radio going, look at these liberals against the war!
[00:47:09.989 --> 00:47:12.750]  No, the liberals are for the war, you dirty beatniks!
[00:47:15.011 --> 00:47:20.793]  It's the fringe on the right and the left that really are the populace in this country that see through these lies.
[00:47:22.654 --> 00:47:24.415]  I mean, look at Bush signing on to UNESCO.
[00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:25.275]  I read this earlier.
[00:47:25.775 --> 00:47:29.016]  This is from UNESCO's 1949 official document.
[00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:29.717]  Their charter.
[00:47:30.037 --> 00:47:31.597]  A ten-part series for teachers.
[00:47:32.178 --> 00:47:34.959]  Published in 1949 under the title, Towards World Understanding,
[00:47:35.683 --> 00:47:48.972]  Asserted that one of the chief aims of education today should be to prepare boys and girls to take an active part in the creation of a world society, but government schools must stamp out love of country, and the family must be viewed as the enemy.
[00:47:49.853 --> 00:47:57.798]  As long as the children breathe the poisoned air of nationalism, education and world-mindedness can produce only rather precarious results.
[00:47:58.438 --> 00:48:03.722]  As we have pointed out, it is frequently the family that infects the child with extreme nationalism.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.463]  And Bush signs on to this and massively increases its funding.
[00:48:09.584 --> 00:48:10.925]  And you call that conservative?
[00:48:11.685 --> 00:48:13.047]  Just like the assault weapons ban.
[00:48:13.767 --> 00:48:14.568]  Just like all of it.
[00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:17.550]  Just like protecting those involved in Pardongate.
[00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:19.051]  Just like the Open Board.
[00:48:19.172 --> 00:48:20.633]  Just like the supercomputers in China.
[00:48:20.933 --> 00:48:22.254]  The reactors in North Korea.
[00:48:22.855 --> 00:48:26.117]  By the way, the transfers are continuing in North Korea as we speak.
[00:48:26.758 --> 00:48:27.759]  Gotta build up that enemy.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.702]  What really happened September 11th?
[00:48:31.882 --> 00:48:32.943]  And who stands to gain?
[00:48:33.673 --> 00:48:34.954]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:48:35.155 --> 00:48:40.900]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:48:41.181 --> 00:48:46.426]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:48:46.726 --> 00:48:50.830]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.812]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:48:55.072 --> 00:48:59.715]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:48:59.795 --> 00:49:06.059]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:49:06.119 --> 00:49:07.940]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.503]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.202]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:49:28.934 --> 00:49:32.396]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:32.676 --> 00:49:36.177]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:36.257 --> 00:49:40.199]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:40.419 --> 00:49:46.582]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:47.002 --> 00:49:54.906]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:55.326 --> 00:50:00.670]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.592]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:04.952 --> 00:50:06.814]  And the Black Berkey filters are recleanable.
[00:50:06.874 --> 00:50:09.055]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:50:09.295 --> 00:50:14.218]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:50:14.419 --> 00:50:19.822]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:22.984 --> 00:50:24.289]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:50:27.569 --> 00:50:29.690]  Are you willing to speculate in today's market?
[00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:33.293]  Options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[00:50:33.813 --> 00:50:35.855]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[00:50:36.195 --> 00:50:39.877]  Right now, we're recommending the purchase of euro currency call options.
[00:50:40.177 --> 00:50:42.199]  The budget and trade deficits are going through the roof.
[00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.380]  The dollar is dropping worldwide.
[00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:46.282]  Could the euro be poised to move higher?
[00:50:46.542 --> 00:50:47.222]  We think so.
[00:50:47.703 --> 00:50:51.645]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call Barclay Financial right now.
[00:50:51.725 --> 00:50:51.965]  Call 1-800-914-3223.

[00:50:57.509 --> 00:50:58.410]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:05.575]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year, and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:05.855 --> 00:51:08.737]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.

[00:51:34.111 --> 00:51:36.012]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:36.492 --> 00:51:39.454]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:41.214 --> 00:51:45.917]  Remember that Knight Ridder's news service headline a few weeks ago?
[00:51:45.957 --> 00:51:48.338]  Neocons call for a new world order?
[00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:54.141]  And the article mentioned, oh yeah, the neocons are the fourth international atrocity.
[00:51:54.541 --> 00:51:56.782]  They decided to become conservatives in the fifties.
[00:51:59.364 --> 00:52:02.568]  Years after Trotsky's death, and they want a new world order.
[00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:05.472]  They want your guns, by the way, but they're conservative.
[00:52:06.714 --> 00:52:13.162]  And now the neocons have said they want to invade 62 countries in a hundred year war, in a national draft.
[00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:16.082]  And, oh, this country's got weapons.
[00:52:16.122 --> 00:52:17.123]  That country's got weapons.
[00:52:17.203 --> 00:52:19.344]  Sovereign country after sovereign country getting hit.
[00:52:19.945 --> 00:52:23.247]  Now they're getting ready for more invasions and they say, oh, more terrorists coming!
[00:52:23.827 --> 00:52:26.389]  Continuity of government's taking over all the other governments.
[00:52:26.469 --> 00:52:27.570]  State government, local government.
[00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:30.291]  We're going to federalize your cities, have a national draft.
[00:52:30.572 --> 00:52:32.213]  We're going to take your lives over!
[00:52:33.654 --> 00:52:40.859]  Well, in my film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, we cover continuity of government, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, executive orders.
[00:52:40.899 --> 00:52:41.299]  That's about
[00:52:42.763 --> 00:52:49.346]  50 minutes, 60 minutes of the 2 hour and 40 minute film, Police State 3, total enslavement!
[00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:53.387]  And I hope that everyone will order the film, folks.
[00:52:53.407 --> 00:52:53.927]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:52:54.107 --> 00:52:54.768]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:57.869 --> 00:53:02.411]  Get the original films, make copies, get them out to your friends and family.
[00:53:12.423 --> 00:53:14.786]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois, then Spencer in Ohio.
[00:53:14.826 --> 00:53:15.587]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:53:15.607 --> 00:53:16.027]  Go ahead.
[00:53:16.368 --> 00:53:17.109]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.970]  Fantastic.
[00:53:18.851 --> 00:53:19.692]  Let me throw this at you.
[00:53:20.412 --> 00:53:22.635]  What if North Korea is a complete decoy?
[00:53:23.376 --> 00:53:26.660]  What if the leader, whatever his name is, is totally in bed with this regime?
[00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:32.124]  Well, we know he's in bed with a communist Chinese who are in bed with the globalists.
[00:53:32.824 --> 00:53:37.246]  So when you say regime, I mean Bush isn't even a regime, he's a front puppet just like Clinton.
[00:53:37.486 --> 00:53:40.247]  Oh, yeah, whatever the organization... No, North Korea is the real deal.
[00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:45.749]  They've been armed, they're psychopathic, they're pure evil, as evil as it gets.
[00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:50.451]  But what about just a scare tactic?
[00:53:50.471 --> 00:53:56.873]  They don't have any resources, they don't have anything to take, you know, taking that country over or whatever is not going to... But in the meantime,
[00:53:58.391 --> 00:53:59.372]  Dan, that's not true.
[00:54:00.112 --> 00:54:05.995]  The Iraqis laid down, special forces infiltrated British and U.S., paid them off in gold bars, euros, and dollars.
[00:54:06.035 --> 00:54:07.216]  That's now admitted before the war.
[00:54:07.356 --> 00:54:08.076]  During the war.
[00:54:08.576 --> 00:54:13.799]  With North Korea, whenever they catch one of their police boats in South Korean waters, everybody takes cyanide.
[00:54:14.219 --> 00:54:15.680]  They're totally mind-controlled.
[00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:21.063]  No, but I'm saying they don't have the resources to steal from, like the Middle East.
[00:54:21.203 --> 00:54:21.703]  You know what I mean?
[00:54:22.303 --> 00:54:25.585]  You forgot that they're one of the biggest opium producers in the world?
[00:54:28.763 --> 00:54:31.225]  And the CIA likes to deal smack, don't they?
[00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:32.806]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:54:32.866 --> 00:54:40.570]  I just think it's a diversionary tactic because in the meantime they're genociding a bunch of people, which is their plan too at the same time.
[00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:47.094]  You keep nutrition away from them, you keep food away from them because they're threatening with the nuclear bombs and stuff.
[00:54:47.515 --> 00:54:49.556]  It's an excuse just to keep that thing going.
[00:54:49.856 --> 00:54:55.940]  Well, I think that the Globalists haven't really cared for the last few decades because Kim Jong-il and his daddy
[00:54:57.023 --> 00:55:00.224]  Dictatorships seem to have hereditary, you know, power systems.
[00:55:00.284 --> 00:55:01.264]  Hmm, what do we have here?
[00:55:01.284 --> 00:55:05.825]  Yeah, they are starving and killing two million people a year.
[00:55:05.865 --> 00:55:07.045]  Their population is dropping.
[00:55:07.385 --> 00:55:09.346]  They are a model country just like China.
[00:55:10.026 --> 00:55:10.946]  That's what I'm thinking.
[00:55:11.026 --> 00:55:13.547]  I'm thinking that there's never going to be any attack over there.
[00:55:13.567 --> 00:55:16.367]  This is just keep the fear going, keep the diversion going.
[00:55:16.407 --> 00:55:17.047]  That's what I said.
[00:55:17.067 --> 00:55:18.188]  Well, it's a good point, Dan.
[00:55:18.208 --> 00:55:19.028]  I appreciate the call.
[00:55:19.048 --> 00:55:20.668]  But they are going into Syria and Iran.
[00:55:20.688 --> 00:55:22.289]  Let's talk to Spencer in Ohio.
[00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:23.589]  Spencer, you're on the air.
[00:55:23.629 --> 00:55:24.009]  Go ahead.
[00:55:24.915 --> 00:55:25.816]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[00:55:26.016 --> 00:55:29.338]  Today is the anniversary of the Rosenbergs being fried.
[00:55:30.439 --> 00:55:31.680]  Who, of course, were patsies.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.241]  It was the army that gave them the nukes.
[00:55:34.022 --> 00:55:36.663]  So if you were president, you wouldn't have fried them back then?
[00:55:37.684 --> 00:55:50.193]  Well, they were communists and they were little minions, but no, the government, as McCarthy found out, ran the communist system at a level above that, and our government gave the Russians the nukes and the weapons and the systems.
[00:55:51.174 --> 00:55:53.736]  So what I'm saying is the Rosenbergs were patsies.
[00:55:54.582 --> 00:55:56.562]  Well, you think Wenho Lee got away with it?
[00:55:56.722 --> 00:55:58.523]  Don't you think he should be brought to justice?
[00:55:59.183 --> 00:55:59.683]  Oh, come on.
[00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:01.303]  You know Wenho Lee was a patsy.
[00:56:01.964 --> 00:56:02.824]  That's been proven.
[00:56:03.264 --> 00:56:04.924]  Now, Operation Northwood.
[00:56:04.944 --> 00:56:07.725]  How did that survive if nobody knew about it?
[00:56:08.585 --> 00:56:10.145]  It was a declassified U.S.
[00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:12.966]  government plan to carry out terror.
[00:56:12.986 --> 00:56:15.026]  It's an admitted declassified plan, Spencer.
[00:56:16.147 --> 00:56:16.267]  U.S.
[00:56:16.287 --> 00:56:18.207]  government plan to carry out terror in America.
[00:56:19.737 --> 00:56:24.979]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.861]  It's the 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values.
[00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:29.621]  I love going to all the big gun shows.
[00:56:34.264 --> 00:56:37.425]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:45.015 --> 00:56:45.657]  Big Brother.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.383]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:48.105 --> 00:56:49.208]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:50.653]  You want answers?
[00:56:51.435 --> 00:56:52.218]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.913]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:57.174 --> 00:57:01.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:01.517 --> 00:57:21.714]  You've heard that the woman known as Roe, in Roe v. Wade, the plaintiff to the Supreme Court in 73, landmark case that legalized the extermination now of 50 plus million children, it dwarfs
[00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:51.156]  uh... slavery and the amount of deaths and uh... despair that we had in this country the slavery of black people and uh... now the uh... the uh... woman known as rogue has uh... well she's allowed to have a brief to the court because uh... she was a plaintiff in the case she's of course a born-again christian and knows now that it's murder and wants to reverse this and it's being brought to the Supreme Court joining us is Sharon Blakeney
[00:57:52.222 --> 00:58:09.926]  And we appreciate her joining us, attorney and counselor at law, and she is one of the lawyers on the team with the organization here in Texas that is countering the government and trying to reverse this Nazi policy.
[00:58:10.886 --> 00:58:13.207]  And Sharon, thanks for joining us on the show today.
[00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:14.467]  Great to be here, Alex.
[00:58:14.887 --> 00:58:17.948]  Tell us about yourself, tell us about your client and where this is all going, please.
[00:58:19.088 --> 00:58:22.390]  Well, obviously it's going to be going to the Supreme Court.
[00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:29.373]  Our client is tremendously relieved, quite frankly, Alex, at the filing of this.
[00:58:29.674 --> 00:58:35.396]  I don't know if you got to see any of the press coverage, but it really lifted a great weight off of her shoulders.
[00:58:35.477 --> 00:58:43.981]  She has borne this burden for quite some time after she realized the travesty that abortion is to women and children.
[00:58:44.797 --> 00:58:52.122]  And she very much wishes to see this case set aside and overturned and we fully intend to represent her in doing that.
[00:58:53.223 --> 00:59:03.850]  Well that's wonderful and give us details about your client and I want to revisit the 73 case and then look at what you think is going to happen with the new case at the Supreme Court.
[00:59:04.551 --> 00:59:04.951]  Okay.
[00:59:06.515 --> 00:59:14.979]  Well, basically, her affidavit, you can see it online if you go to www.operationoutcry.org.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.701]  You can actually read much more about Norma's story.
[00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:27.605]  Very briefly, though, back in 1970, Norma was a homeless woman that was pregnant and did seek an abortion.
[00:59:27.765 --> 00:59:28.666]  She went to a doctor.
[00:59:28.726 --> 00:59:35.449]  The doctor said, it's illegal to perform abortion in Texas, but I know an attorney that would like to see that changed and maybe she can help you.
[00:59:36.544 --> 00:59:41.246]  And then Norma was introduced to the attorney that filed the Roe vs. Wade case.
[00:59:42.507 --> 00:59:43.847]  Norma actually had her baby.
[00:59:43.887 --> 00:59:48.329]  She did not have an abortion and the baby was put up for adoption.
[00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:56.392]  However, she had very little contact after that point when she signed the affidavit for her attorney regarding the case itself.
[00:59:56.432 --> 00:59:57.353]  There was no trial.
[00:59:57.773 --> 00:59:59.273]  There was no fact-finding hearing.
[00:59:59.313 --> 01:00:00.494]  No evidentiary hearing at all.
[01:00:01.013 --> 01:00:08.726]  It was all based on summary judgment motions and Norma McCorvey herself learned of the ruling at the Supreme Court by reading it in the Dallas Morning News.
[01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:15.076]  Alex?
[01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:19.190]  Yes, I'm right here.
[01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:22.592]  I was over here on the other side of the studio digging through news articles.
[01:00:22.672 --> 01:00:23.072]  I'm listening.
[01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:23.472]  Go ahead.
[01:00:23.492 --> 01:00:24.093]  Okay.
[01:00:25.113 --> 01:00:27.135]  Just wanted to make sure you're still there.
[01:00:28.155 --> 01:00:42.104]  Basically, after the ruling, Norma did become a worker in abortion clinics for several years, and it was during that time that she saw how abortion negatively affected women.
[01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:46.371]  And then she became a Christian and very pro-life.
[01:00:46.411 --> 01:00:48.812]  She has her own pro-life ministry, Roe No More.
[01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:53.616]  And that is how we came to represent her.
[01:00:54.456 --> 01:01:06.785]  And through what we believe will be a dramatic change in the law of this country, we have filed this Rule 60 motion on her behalf to see the case overturned.
[01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:12.268]  Now, President Bush's wife is against overturning Roe v. Wade.
[01:01:12.288 --> 01:01:15.770]  Do you think Bush will try to block this somehow?
[01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:29.678]  No, actually, Alex, if you look online at the press briefing that Ari Fleischer gave yesterday morning, he was asked directly if the President has ever contended that the Supreme Court was wrong in ruling on Roe v. Wade.
[01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:39.006]  And Ari Fleischer answered that the President repeatedly said throughout 2000... Alright, Sharon stay right there, we'll be right back.
[01:01:42.129 --> 01:01:48.074]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:02:39.696 --> 01:02:44.041]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:48.647]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:53.192]  There is a chance to use this disaster in a New World Order.
[01:02:53.272 --> 01:02:54.554]  A New World Order?

[01:04:57.485 --> 01:05:01.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.976 --> 01:05:13.137]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:13.757 --> 01:05:25.182]  We're live already into the second hour, in fact 8 minutes and 40 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast as we go out on the AM and FM dial on a growing list of wonderful affiliates.
[01:05:25.603 --> 01:05:31.785]  Simulcast on global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 9320 and at night at 5.085 and 6890 and on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:38.277 --> 01:05:41.498]  Roe wants abortion case reversed.
[01:05:41.718 --> 01:05:46.719]  Associated Press, the former plaintiff known as Jane Roe, in a 73 U.S.
[01:05:47.059 --> 01:05:58.603]  Supreme Court case that legalized abortion, sought to have the case overturned in a motion filed Tuesday that asked the courts to consider new evidence that abortion hurts women.
[01:05:58.743 --> 01:05:59.643]  Norma McCorvey,
[01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:07.296]  Who joined the anti-abortion fight nearly 10 years ago, says she regrets her role in Roe v. Wade.
[01:06:07.316 --> 01:06:09.418]  Again, that was the alias, Roe v. Wade.
[01:06:10.018 --> 01:06:23.130]  Says the Supreme Court decision is no longer valid because scientific and anecdotal evidence that has come to light in the last 30 years has shown the negative effects of abortion, including increased chances of cancer,
[01:06:24.769 --> 01:06:29.633]  You know, if God wants you to abort, and it's a bad pregnancy, it'll happen, folks.
[01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:38.020]  And it's very bad for women to increase cancer, if you do it in an unnatural fashion, if you go in and kill the baby.
[01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:47.528]  It also causes massive emotional problems, and it creates all these damaged women who then join the New World Order cause to carry all of this out.
[01:06:48.457 --> 01:06:50.498]  And we're getting our babies back.
[01:06:50.538 --> 01:06:57.843]  A jubilant McCorvey said at a news conference, all flanked by about 60 women, some who sobbed and held signs that read, I regret my abortion.
[01:06:58.263 --> 01:07:02.205]  I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders, said McCorvey, 55.
[01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:13.225]  And Sarah Weddington, who I just so happen to meet here in Austin, because she lives here in Austin, the abortion advocate attorney who originally represented McCorvey, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
[01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:18.970]  Representative from the National Organization of Women also did not immediately return a message.
[01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:24.595]  And we're joined by one of Norma McCorvey's lawyers, attorneys,
[01:07:25.665 --> 01:07:35.353]  Sharon Blakeney, and she is with the Justice Foundation that is trying to counter what's happening.
[01:07:35.554 --> 01:07:41.559]  And Sharon, we were talking about Bush saying that he is against Roe v. Wade, which is a good thing.
[01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:51.907]  He wanted to make some comments to go into the history of what happened, how Norman McCorvey was used, and what this means now in the Supreme Court having the case reopened.
[01:07:51.927 --> 01:07:52.548]  Please continue.
[01:07:54.119 --> 01:08:05.126]  Well, obviously we're thrilled that the President has come out strongly voicing his opposition to Roe vs. Wade through Ari Fleischer yesterday morning in the press conference.
[01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:08.968]  And we feel this just confirms that this is the right thing to do.
[01:08:09.249 --> 01:08:17.914]  And as far as what this means, I believe, Alex, it's going to mean a dramatic history-making change in the laws of this country.
[01:08:20.256 --> 01:08:21.757]  Well, that's certainly the case.
[01:08:22.818 --> 01:08:42.091]  Going back to some more of the history of Norman McCorvey, known as Jane Robe, this homeless woman who they basically used, and then how she got into the abortion industry, the death mills, and then her awakening to this great evil, and now how she's trying to counter this, definitely a testament to her.
[01:08:42.691 --> 01:08:46.834]  Can you give us the history of this for those that aren't aware of it?
[01:08:48.532 --> 01:08:51.893]  Well, you gave a very good summary just then, Alex.
[01:08:52.093 --> 01:08:56.254]  I'm not sure that I could add it to many more details.
[01:08:56.274 --> 01:09:01.155]  I know that her story is in her affidavit that is on our website.
[01:09:02.335 --> 01:09:08.477]  Obviously, she saw some very terrible things working in the abortion clinics that clearly pricked her conscience.
[01:09:09.257 --> 01:09:16.879]  She came to realize that abortion is a great cruelty to women, that it's not a benefit to women, it's not a good thing.
[01:09:17.581 --> 01:09:22.486]  And she saw herself the pain that women went through when they suffered abortions.
[01:09:23.206 --> 01:09:34.376]  And through her work there at the clinic, she met a Christian that led her to the Lord, and her life has been dramatically turned around, and she very much wants to see this case overturned.
[01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:38.680]  And we're very pleased and honored to assist her in that endeavor.
[01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.823]  Now, it was clear that the socialists and the
[01:09:45.558 --> 01:09:48.540]  God-haters wanted to legalize abortion.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:56.404]  And we know that the United Nations organization known as UNESCO pushes abortion worldwide in a big way.
[01:09:56.964 --> 01:10:00.326]  So they wanted this and it's clear they used Norma McCorvey.
[01:10:01.526 --> 01:10:13.693]  Can you explain to us the legal system, how this works, how someone who has already had a case before the court can resubmit the case and give us some of the websites we can read the brief that you have filed?
[01:10:14.534 --> 01:10:15.035]  Absolutely.
[01:10:15.115 --> 01:10:37.397]  Our website is www.operationoutcry.org and if you click on the press packet icon there on the homepage, you will be able to read Norma's affidavit and the actual brief and motion that were filed with the Federal District Court in Dallas.
[01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:45.596]  Basically, the legal basis for the motion is found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 60.
[01:10:46.476 --> 01:11:05.753]  Under a Rule 60 motion, someone who is a party to a case can come back and file a motion with the court based upon changes in law or changes in facts that make it no longer just or equitable for the previous ruling of the court to have prospective application
[01:11:06.286 --> 01:11:22.897]  In other words, when a prior ruling of the court has become a manifest injustice or is clearly erroneous, given the changes in law and fact that have come to light since the original ruling, the court can overrule its case.
[01:11:22.917 --> 01:11:31.043]  And any idea on, or have any of the justices made comments like Scalia or Rehnquist
[01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:43.206]  Well, I don't know that they've made any publicly, and most likely they've not.
[01:11:43.586 --> 01:11:50.272]  Judges are not allowed to make comment on a case that might possibly be before them.
[01:11:50.312 --> 01:11:57.858]  And we fully expect that this case certainly will not have a final decision in the federal district court in Dallas.
[01:11:57.878 --> 01:12:00.520]  Most likely it is going to be appealed by one side or the other.
[01:12:01.349 --> 01:12:11.496]  And the interesting thing is, at this point, the only parties at this point are our client, Norman McCorvey, and the state itself.
[01:12:11.856 --> 01:12:17.160]  And the state of Texas' interest, obviously, in the previous ruling was to enforce the laws of the state of Texas.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.382]  The laws of the state of Texas are that abortion should be illegal.
[01:12:20.822 --> 01:12:27.226]  So in this case, we have the original pro-abortion forces, now anti-abortion, as the plaintiff,
[01:12:29.065 --> 01:12:35.611]  So a role reversal and then on the other side you have the state who was in a proper position before against the abortion.
[01:12:36.011 --> 01:12:41.876]  So now are we going to see, in fact that was my next question, very astute comments from you.
[01:12:42.236 --> 01:12:48.682]  What about Sarah Weddington and the others that are pro-death and pro-annihilation of humanity?
[01:12:49.262 --> 01:12:54.167]  How do you counter them or are they going to get involved or will it be now or will it be people,
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:57.740]  No.
[01:12:58.201 --> 01:13:01.143]  Claiming that she's being denied abortions?
[01:13:01.223 --> 01:13:02.304]  I mean, what's going to happen here?
[01:13:03.605 --> 01:13:11.552]  It'll be interesting to see, and I certainly can't speak with any accuracy on that.
[01:13:12.352 --> 01:13:19.358]  But obviously, Sarah Weddington is no longer Norman McCorvey's attorney, and we're very grateful to God for that.
[01:13:20.099 --> 01:13:23.261]  So, at this point, she has no voice in this case.
[01:13:23.782 --> 01:13:25.263]  I don't know if any other
[01:13:26.609 --> 01:13:28.311]  Parties will attempt to intervene.
[01:13:28.331 --> 01:13:32.155]  I don't know that they would be successful even if they did.
[01:13:32.175 --> 01:13:36.119]  This is a prior party to a prior cause of action.
[01:13:36.139 --> 01:13:42.866]  This type of motion has not been utilized extensively in the past.
[01:13:43.226 --> 01:13:46.509]  There's one case, Agostini v. Felton.
[01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:49.052]  It was an establishment of religion case.
[01:13:49.545 --> 01:13:56.586]  Where the courts came back several years after a previous ruling and overturned the ruling.
[01:13:57.127 --> 01:14:14.570]  Just by way of comment, I did notice on Fox News that their legal analyst, the judge, and his last name is escaping me at this moment, but if you look on their website, there's a comment from their senior legal analyst saying that in the Agostini case,
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.487]  That the parties were able to have their case overruled because it only affected them.
[01:14:21.348 --> 01:14:26.274]  That is a great misstatement of the facts of that case of Agostini because in that case
[01:14:26.926 --> 01:14:31.029]  It affected the entire school system of the state of New York.
[01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:38.214]  And so, there was many, many party or persons that were affected by the ruling of the court.
[01:14:38.234 --> 01:14:46.180]  Well, look, I can't claim that Roe v. Wade just applies to Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe, being able to get her abortion.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.101]  Exactly.
[01:14:47.141 --> 01:14:50.283]  Because it legalized this grisly practice.
[01:14:50.923 --> 01:14:53.185]  Nationwide, and was used as that precedent.
[01:14:53.225 --> 01:14:59.829]  So clearly the precedent states that, and they can't suddenly tell us the sky is red when we all know it's blue.
[01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:00.749]  Exactly.
[01:15:00.769 --> 01:15:02.931]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[01:15:03.091 --> 01:15:18.500]  And basically, under the law, the ruling in Agostini, and the basis of the Rule 60 motion, we have the changes in law and the changes in fact that support the idea that prospective application of Roe is just no longer just.
[01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:21.682]  We know now that abortion is terrible for women.
[01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:38.419]  We have over a thousand affidavits that were filed with the court with testimonies of women of physical complications, miscarriages, infertility, cancer, depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, promiscuity, the list goes on and on.
[01:15:38.499 --> 01:15:40.281]  It's a terrible travesty for women.
[01:15:40.774 --> 01:15:44.297]  Then we have all of the new scientific evidence about the humanity of the child.
[01:15:44.437 --> 01:15:51.524]  At the time that Roe was decided, the court itself said, we don't know and we're not going to speculate about when life begins.
[01:15:51.924 --> 01:15:52.905]  Well, now we know.
[01:15:52.925 --> 01:15:54.987]  I mean, people, children are born
[01:15:56.668 --> 01:15:57.669]  Very early on.
[01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:59.712]  As early as 21 weeks in some cases.
[01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:01.033]  And still live at this time.
[01:16:01.273 --> 01:16:02.555]  Absolutely.
[01:16:02.955 --> 01:16:04.137]  Take partial birth abortion.
[01:16:04.157 --> 01:16:06.199]  They're killing babies that could be adopted on the spot.
[01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:07.000]  Exactly.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:07.841]  Stay right there.
[01:16:07.881 --> 01:16:08.561]  We've got a break.
[01:16:08.582 --> 01:16:09.182]  We'll come back.

[01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.840]  Government should only exist to protect those rights.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.721]  This calendar affirms your ideals.
[01:19:03.941 --> 01:19:06.383]  It shows you where your rights are protected in the Constitution.

[01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.247]  Call 800-687-2237.
[01:19:13.528 --> 01:19:14.148]  Know your rights.

[01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.370]  I think so.
[01:19:40.214 --> 01:19:48.478]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:48.738 --> 01:19:53.099]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:20:02.303]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:20:06.405 --> 01:20:11.449]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:20:11.729 --> 01:20:18.455]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:20:18.945 --> 01:20:19.605]  What about you?
[01:20:20.245 --> 01:20:25.607]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:20:44.284 --> 01:20:50.307]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:50.927 --> 01:20:53.929]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:00.832 --> 01:21:02.673]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[01:21:02.693 --> 01:21:08.176]  We're talking to Sharon Blankney, attorney and counselor in law she represents.
[01:21:09.412 --> 01:21:15.035]  The woman known as Jane Roe from the landmark 73 Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade.
[01:21:16.516 --> 01:21:30.945]  And Sharon, I was saying before we hit the last break that it's got to feel good to be involved in something that potentially could save millions and millions, hundreds of millions, they've already killed 54 million children.
[01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:35.668]  And the next Einstein, the next George Washington, the next Orville Wright,
[01:21:39.926 --> 01:21:47.072]  Somebody that could be one of our presidents, or scientists, or auto mechanics, or loving fathers, or mothers, it doesn't matter.
[01:21:48.072 --> 01:22:00.383]  This is incredible, and it's got to be, just, you've got to be, I mean, I know you haven't won the case, you haven't overturned this great evil yet, but it's got to really, you really are getting something done here.
[01:22:00.923 --> 01:22:01.824]  What does it feel like?
[01:22:01.904 --> 01:22:03.986]  Is it rewarding to be involved in something like this?
[01:22:04.964 --> 01:22:08.906]  It's a tremendous blessing to me, Alex, on a number of different levels.
[01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:16.170]  Most importantly, personally, I experienced abortion when I was in high school.
[01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:20.052]  It was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.
[01:22:20.552 --> 01:22:28.256]  Through the grace of God, I have the opportunity to use the horrible experience that I suffered and the education that God blessed me with.
[01:22:28.846 --> 01:22:33.728]  To hopefully protect other women from experiencing the same thing that I did.
[01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:40.750]  Well, they claim that they give you options, but when you go to these places, I've talked to the women, they just sell you on it.
[01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.550]  It's not a human.
[01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:42.491]  This won't hurt you.
[01:22:42.511 --> 01:22:50.393]  They don't tell you about the cancer risk, the depression, how it causes a lot of women to become infertile, all the horrible things it does.
[01:22:51.173 --> 01:22:53.054]  That's right.
[01:22:53.154 --> 01:22:55.995]  It's not an informed consent procedure.
[01:22:56.759 --> 01:22:57.700]  It's truly not.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.602]  And honestly, Alex, I don't know that it could ever be.
[01:23:00.862 --> 01:23:07.307]  Because no matter how much information they would give you until you actually experienced it, I don't think you really know.
[01:23:08.228 --> 01:23:17.055]  And that's why, you know, if you look at the situation with physician-assisted suicide, this Supreme Court, the same one that the justices we have right now,
[01:23:17.874 --> 01:23:31.380]  Most recently ruled that because a person in a position that might consider physician-assisted suicide is under such extreme duress, they could never make an informed decision.
[01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:35.802]  That's why physician-assisted suicide was ruled illegal.
[01:23:36.022 --> 01:23:45.747]  Well, it's also turned out that Wesley Smith's work in the Wall Street Journal that most people that have been killed by doctors weren't even terminally ill or mentally ill.
[01:23:46.369 --> 01:23:46.970]  Exactly.
[01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:58.764]  And that if they were denied their right to the physician-assisted suicide, once their pain was relieved or they received some emotional comfort, they were glad that it didn't happen.
[01:23:59.084 --> 01:24:02.889]  And that's exactly what we see happens with women that are
[01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:04.134]  I think.
[01:24:20.327 --> 01:24:23.350]  I mean, I know you've got to have ideas of what their attack plan is going to be.
[01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:29.677]  Also, the Supreme Court, the makeup of it, are they going to give us some whitewash ruling that doesn't really get rid of abortion?
[01:24:30.538 --> 01:24:36.304]  What do your analytical skills and skills of law and understanding and research show you?
[01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.066]  And what are your colleagues saying?
[01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.268]  What do you see happening?
[01:24:39.528 --> 01:24:40.169]  Predictions.
[01:24:42.367 --> 01:24:48.291]  Well, for obvious reasons, there's not too much that I want to comment on in that area.
[01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:51.613]  Clearly, we have some ideas as to what they may or may not try.
[01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:55.595]  In case they haven't thought of it yet, I don't know that I want to share my thoughts as to what they might do.
[01:25:00.814 --> 01:25:04.236]  I really feel that this is going to be a successful effort.
[01:25:04.296 --> 01:25:08.299]  We have the law and the facts and God on our side.
[01:25:08.319 --> 01:25:19.907]  And that's why they've been desperately trying to stop people peaceably protesting, showing people pictures of what abortion really looks like, because they know if people knew the truth, Americans would be against this.
[01:25:20.608 --> 01:25:23.690]  Now, even Dick Gephardt voted to ban partial birth abortion.
[01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:26.532]  Where is the partial birth abortion ban right now?
[01:25:26.592 --> 01:25:27.572]  Is Bush going to sign that?
[01:25:27.632 --> 01:25:28.293]  I mean, where is it?
[01:25:30.544 --> 01:25:52.957]  Now I haven't, I'll be honest with you, I've been a little busy with our case and I haven't looked intently at that issue in the last week or so but my understanding was it had passed both the House and the Senate but different versions of it and so it had to go to committee for them to reconcile the differences and once that occurs then the bill should be presented to the President for signature which he has indicated he would sign.
[01:25:54.085 --> 01:25:55.206]  Well, that's good news.
[01:25:55.366 --> 01:25:56.667]  That is incredible news.
[01:25:57.228 --> 01:26:00.250]  I want to come back and take some calls in our final segment with you.
[01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:03.413]  The total free number to join us, listeners, is 800-259-9231.
[01:26:03.433 --> 01:26:08.377]  We're talking to Sharon Laitney.
[01:26:08.477 --> 01:26:10.439]  She is attorney and counselor at LAWB.
[01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:14.382]  We'll tell you about the websites and how to get involved and how to support these organizations.
[01:26:15.166 --> 01:26:20.771]  And again, she is the lawyer for Jane Roe in the 1973 U.S.
[01:26:20.811 --> 01:26:22.593]  Supreme Court case.
[01:26:23.374 --> 01:26:29.379]  She is the lawyer now countering that case that was brought by Sarah Weddington.
[01:26:29.399 --> 01:26:30.140]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:31.922 --> 01:26:32.842]  We're on the march.
[01:26:33.303 --> 01:26:34.924]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:35.845 --> 01:26:38.508]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:41.781 --> 01:26:43.382]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:49.487]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:26:49.747 --> 01:26:52.289]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible.
[01:26:52.309 --> 01:26:53.009]  The Arc Institute.
[01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:54.390]  Call the Arc Institute today.
[01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:55.051]  Toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:56.112]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com.
[01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:21.967]  If you want to find out more about the globalists and what they're up to and what they're doing, you'll want to visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:23.289 --> 01:27:24.751]  In the last hour,
[01:27:25.868 --> 01:27:30.591]  I covered a story out of Newsmax with his conservative, Bill Brennan, in Eskos.
[01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.033]  Thrangle the monster in its crib.
[01:27:33.713 --> 01:27:44.561]  Unless Congress regains a modicum of sanity, the United States of America is about to rejoin an organization dedicated to the destruction of the last vestiges of Christian civilization.
[01:27:45.788 --> 01:27:54.131]  For reasons inexplicable to most sensible Americans, September 2002, an otherwise sensible President George W. Bush told the United Nations that the U.S.
[01:27:54.151 --> 01:28:05.114]  will rejoin the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, a wild-eyed bunch of President Reagan abandoned in 1984, noting that it was utterly corrupt and the U.S.
[01:28:05.134 --> 01:28:06.974]  had no business being a member of such a group.
[01:28:07.034 --> 01:28:11.816]  Most Americans are blissfully ignorant of the insidious nature of the crowd of one world
[01:28:12.552 --> 01:28:32.383]  Paganistic pseudo-communists, and real ones in some cases, who are bound and determined to create a new world order, establish a new world religion of tree worshippers that supplants and scorns Christianity, promotes abortion worldwide, seeks to capture control of schools and school children, and is in the process of transforming national and privately owned property in the U.S.
[01:28:32.423 --> 01:28:34.324]  and elsewhere into its greedy hands.
[01:28:34.344 --> 01:28:35.145]  So here's the problem.
[01:28:35.745 --> 01:28:41.168]  Bush, under pressure, cuts eighty-something million to the worldwide abortion mill, which is much bigger than here.
[01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:48.315]  Obviously, there's 6 billion people worldwide and then another 280 something million tacked on here.
[01:28:48.475 --> 01:28:53.200]  So 50 plus million abortions here over the last 30 years, or 27 years, 30 years.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.021]  Imagine what it is overseas.
[01:28:55.622 --> 01:29:00.066]  And now Bush has actually increased funding in the billions for other big abortion programs.
[01:29:00.106 --> 01:29:05.431]  Now obviously, it's up to you to put pressure on the White House to back out of this.
[01:29:06.115 --> 01:29:11.839]  We wouldn't be having abortion in deep trouble in this country if it wasn't for people taking action.
[01:29:11.859 --> 01:29:24.208]  If it wasn't for people getting arrested, protesting abortion clinics, and counseling young women and men, and trying to teach abstinence, and trying to save our society from the MTV devil culture.
[01:29:24.228 --> 01:29:25.229]  It's the only way to describe it.
[01:29:26.049 --> 01:29:26.990]  This culture of death.
[01:29:27.802 --> 01:29:36.004]  I know we've got a lot of callers, Roger, Bob, Debbie, and others that are holding that want to talk to our guest, who I really appreciate joining us, Sharon Blakeney.
[01:29:36.785 --> 01:29:38.885]  And we are about to go to your call.
[01:29:38.945 --> 01:29:41.386]  She is one of the lawyers representing Jane Roe.
[01:29:41.646 --> 01:29:46.848]  That was, of course, the alias for Norman McCorvey in the famous case Roe v. Wade from 1973.
[01:29:48.946 --> 01:29:54.350]  Sharon, any other points you want to make, websites you want to give out, points you need to make before we go to these calls?
[01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:58.053]  Let me suggest one thing for your listeners, Alex.
[01:29:58.513 --> 01:30:10.683]  As you know, the makeup of the Supreme Court is of incredible importance, especially given this case that we have filed, which may and most likely will be heard there sometime in the near future.
[01:30:11.064 --> 01:30:13.626]  We're facing some possible vacancies on that court.
[01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:18.772]  President Bush, in his campaign, had said that he would promote a culture of life.
[01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:21.874]  There is a project called Project Rosebud.
[01:30:21.934 --> 01:30:36.261]  If you go to www.F2A, that stands for Faith to Action, F2A.org, you can be a part of Project Rosebud, which is sending roses to President Bush for $10.
[01:30:36.741 --> 01:30:42.824]  You can send a rose to President Bush with a message supporting his decision to promote a culture of life and to
[01:30:44.113 --> 01:30:46.114]  I bet the White House is just full of roses now.
[01:31:00.049 --> 01:31:01.869]  That there's going to be a pro-life justice there.
[01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:02.810]  I've got another idea.
[01:31:02.850 --> 01:31:03.510]  That's a good idea.
[01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:04.590]  How about sending a rose?
[01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:05.711]  Maybe I should start this.
[01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:08.531]  It says, please don't sign the assault weapons ban.
[01:31:11.312 --> 01:31:12.392]  Well, I don't know.
[01:31:12.412 --> 01:31:14.773]  The rose is the symbol for the pro-life movement.
[01:31:14.793 --> 01:31:22.275]  I'm not sure what the assault rifle ban symbol is, but you're on the right track, Alex.
[01:31:22.535 --> 01:31:25.917]  Yeah, something that is non-threatening, but gets the point across.
[01:31:25.977 --> 01:31:27.018]  That's correct.
[01:31:27.158 --> 01:31:30.760]  And Janet Folger, the Director of Face to Action, is wonderful at that.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.622]  If your listeners have never been to her website, I suggest they go.
[01:31:33.642 --> 01:31:37.444]  She highlights the best of what everybody is doing across the country.
[01:31:37.484 --> 01:31:46.710]  What are some of the other websites for the... I mean, what about the organization you're a member of that's been helping to fund this?
[01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:48.711]  That is OperationOutcry.org.
[01:31:50.397 --> 01:31:56.479]  And on there, they can also support the Justice Foundation, which I am a part of, which has filed this case.
[01:31:56.679 --> 01:31:59.279]  And that's based right here in Texas?
[01:31:59.539 --> 01:32:00.159]  That's correct.
[01:32:00.279 --> 01:32:06.241]  And obviously, the Justice Foundation requests your prayer, your financial support, and affidavits.
[01:32:06.441 --> 01:32:19.624]  If there are post-abortive women that have not provided affidavits to us yet, they can go online, fill out their affidavit, have it notarized, and send it in, and we probably will have an evidentiary hearing, and we'll still have some time to
[01:32:20.123 --> 01:32:22.964]  File more affidavits with the court if they get them in quickly.
[01:32:23.324 --> 01:32:25.665]  Alright, so those websites for women that may want to do that?
[01:32:26.025 --> 01:32:28.965]  That's correct, and that's operationoutcry.org.
[01:32:29.106 --> 01:32:30.806]  Okay, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:32:31.006 --> 01:32:34.007]  Roger in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:32:34.827 --> 01:32:40.509]  Yes, thanks folks, and if you please Alex, I have three or four comments slash questions if you keep coming back to me.
[01:32:40.909 --> 01:32:48.731]  Now it's my understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that even some otherwise good Christian media analysts
[01:32:49.654 --> 01:32:57.138]  As suggested, that Roe or any subsequent decision has ruled regarding the personhood of that unborn child.
[01:32:57.178 --> 01:33:02.241]  And isn't it true, in fact, that that was studiously avoided in every decision?
[01:33:05.278 --> 01:33:10.941]  Roger, they have, the Supreme Court has ruled that a fetus is not a person.
[01:33:11.061 --> 01:33:19.045]  A fetus obviously is an unborn child, and if you look in Black's Law Dictionary, that's what the definition of fetus is, although the other side doesn't want you to know that.
[01:33:19.085 --> 01:33:22.706]  So it's two word games, like what does the word is, is mean?
[01:33:23.066 --> 01:33:23.887]  Exactly.
[01:33:23.927 --> 01:33:26.048]  Do you just de-factor or explicitly?
[01:33:26.568 --> 01:33:26.948]  Correct.
[01:33:27.048 --> 01:33:34.230]  Now, one thing the court has not done, which our case is specifically requesting, is rule upon the humanity of the child.
[01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:38.751]  They have never been presented scientific evidence regarding the humanity of the child.
[01:33:39.391 --> 01:33:42.312]  And so that is something very... I mean, come on, folks!
[01:33:42.372 --> 01:33:48.914]  It's an embryonic human, just like a little seedling is an oak tree, and I'm sick and tired of these word games.
[01:33:49.574 --> 01:33:49.994]  Exactly.
[01:33:50.054 --> 01:33:51.354]  It's got 46 chromosomes.
[01:33:51.674 --> 01:33:52.134]  It's a human.
[01:33:55.134 --> 01:34:16.518]  There's probably a short-form name for that constitutional provision, some doctrine name, where the Congress can say, by the way, we have determined that the unborn child is a person and entitled to all the rights and protections under the Constitution, etc., etc., and the Supreme Court cannot rule to the contrary.
[01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:17.798]  Case closed.
[01:34:18.459 --> 01:34:20.759]  Is there a name for that, and might not that be a better route?
[01:34:23.467 --> 01:34:26.309]  Well, Roger, I don't know about a better route.
[01:34:26.529 --> 01:34:30.652]  This is the route at this time that we're taking.
[01:34:30.712 --> 01:34:33.174]  You're saying it's a human being... Right.
[01:34:33.454 --> 01:34:38.798]  If you're speaking of a constitutional amendment, which would require ratification by the state... No, no, no.
[01:34:38.838 --> 01:34:40.319]  That doesn't require an amendment.
[01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:45.222]  You're saying that the Ninth and Fifth and Fourth Amendment would cover this?
[01:34:45.402 --> 01:34:50.006]  I should have the article section in the Constitution, but it does say that Congress can
[01:34:50.746 --> 01:34:53.848]  Keep the Supreme Court hands off on a particular matter.
[01:34:53.868 --> 01:34:55.049]  Roger, I've got other callers.
[01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:56.489]  Do you want to make your last point?
[01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:57.690]  Uh, yeah.
[01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:13.539]  Now, even some people that support the right to abortion, which was, of course, invented out of whole cloth in Roe, there's even some liberal atheists, etc., that while they want that right, they see that as a horrible decision in itself.
[01:35:13.819 --> 01:35:16.020]  They would want to see it through some other avenue.
[01:35:17.801 --> 01:35:18.001]  And I...
[01:35:21.767 --> 01:35:25.749]  I think your case might say, well, that was wrong for Norman McCorvey.
[01:35:26.689 --> 01:35:31.352]  Nevertheless, that doesn't undermine the general principle.
[01:35:31.372 --> 01:35:33.833]  OK, Roger, I'm going to let you go.
[01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:34.633]  We've got a lot of callers.
[01:35:34.753 --> 01:35:40.996]  And the point you're making we made in the last segment, and you made some good points, Roger, we've got to be fair to the listeners.
[01:35:41.016 --> 01:35:43.498]  We only have a few minutes left with our guests, about nine minutes left.
[01:35:44.904 --> 01:36:02.350]  We already said this, that they're gonna try, and she talked about the analyst on Fox, our guest did, the lawyer representing Norma McCorvey, going back to the Supreme Court, that they're already trying to say, okay, well this will just be in the individual case of Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, of the true name.
[01:36:03.311 --> 01:36:09.413]  The point is, it was used as a precedent to legalize abortion nationwide, they cannot say that, and if they try it, it's a total fraud.
[01:36:09.433 --> 01:36:11.053]  Any other comments on that subject, Sharon?
[01:36:12.194 --> 01:36:12.954]  I agree with you, Alex.
[01:36:13.579 --> 01:36:22.922]  Okay, so it's clear, the precedent's clear, it's been used in the state governments, in the state rulings and other federal rulings, so there is no debate on this, though they'll probably try.
[01:36:23.282 --> 01:36:24.583]  Bob in Colorado.
[01:36:24.623 --> 01:36:25.423]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:36:25.463 --> 01:36:25.903]  Go ahead.
[01:36:26.823 --> 01:36:28.664]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Sharon.
[01:36:29.764 --> 01:36:37.007]  Just a point that I have a problem with, and that is using the term abortion.
[01:36:37.407 --> 01:36:40.648]  Abortion is nature's way of doing something
[01:36:41.297 --> 01:36:46.079]  To correct her wrong, but what we're talking about is infant side.
[01:36:46.559 --> 01:36:49.280]  Invasive, invasive medical murder.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:57.323]  That's right, and this is practiced by not only the mother, but by the butchers of science that perform these operations.
[01:36:57.343 --> 01:37:05.326]  Well, they're the real parties, because they're doctors, they have a Hippocratic Oath, they know what they're doing, they pull those little arms and legs out of there.
[01:37:05.746 --> 01:37:12.452]  Well, wouldn't it be more correct to call it infancide than abortion, because abortion pertains to a whole other subject.
[01:37:12.472 --> 01:37:14.374]  Yeah, we get back to semantical terms.
[01:37:14.414 --> 01:37:17.377]  The enemy is good at manipulating terms.
[01:37:17.417 --> 01:37:20.340]  Any comments to what Bob is saying, Sharon?
[01:37:21.541 --> 01:37:24.123]  Well, I don't really care what they call it.
[01:37:24.163 --> 01:37:25.605]  I just don't want it to be legal anymore.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:28.400]  Absolutely.
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:29.901]  Okay, Bob, anything else?
[01:37:30.461 --> 01:37:30.761]  No.
[01:37:30.981 --> 01:37:33.501]  Thank you again, and have a nice day, both of you.
[01:37:33.521 --> 01:37:34.381]  Bono Fortuna.
[01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:35.542]  Thank you, Bob.
[01:37:36.582 --> 01:37:37.402]  Thank you, Bob.
[01:37:38.022 --> 01:37:45.304]  Debbie in Texas, you're on to the air with our guest lawyer representing in the new case with Roe Wade going in there.
[01:37:45.344 --> 01:37:45.704]  Go ahead.
[01:37:46.344 --> 01:37:46.724]  Hello.
[01:37:47.144 --> 01:37:47.544]  Thank you.
[01:37:47.564 --> 01:37:48.745]  I appreciate your work.
[01:37:49.525 --> 01:37:53.226]  And I just wanted to ask two quick little questions.
[01:37:54.606 --> 01:37:55.306]  First was,
[01:37:56.112 --> 01:37:59.614]  What type of cancers are they finding related to abortion?
[01:38:00.355 --> 01:38:01.235]  Female cancers?
[01:38:01.596 --> 01:38:03.397]  Cervical, uterus, breast.
[01:38:03.717 --> 01:38:05.138]  Am I correct saying that?
[01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:06.459]  That's correct.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:07.660]  Okay.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:24.251]  And then the second question is off topic, but I wanted to ask Alex, I have a, my mother's a very intelligent, well-read person that knows a lot of history, and I've been sharing a lot of information with her, your videos and that sort of thing.
[01:38:25.072 --> 01:38:38.611]  And she keeps, she always asks me over and over, what, why do all these globalists and all these secret societies and all these powerful people, why do they get so caught up?
[01:38:39.494 --> 01:38:42.535]  And doing what they're doing, and she keeps saying they're not going to live forever.
[01:38:42.555 --> 01:38:44.096]  So why do they do this?
[01:38:44.276 --> 01:38:45.676]  I mean, I think I know the answer.
[01:38:45.916 --> 01:38:47.537]  But I want to hear your answer.
[01:38:47.757 --> 01:38:51.278]  Well, I mean, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:38:51.638 --> 01:39:01.601]  The nature of power is that people that get into positions of power want more power, and it attracts sociopathic, and in many cases not just sociopathic, but sadistic individuals.
[01:39:02.061 --> 01:39:03.042]  And that's a big question.
[01:39:03.082 --> 01:39:04.222]  Why is there evil in the world?
[01:39:04.242 --> 01:39:04.922]  And we know why.
[01:39:04.982 --> 01:39:07.043]  They follow their father, don't they?
[01:39:07.543 --> 01:39:07.723]  Right.
[01:39:08.023 --> 01:39:10.344]  And I guess it's because a lot of these plans are very long range.
[01:39:24.586 --> 01:39:26.827]  I don't think men, in and of themselves,
[01:39:51.835 --> 01:39:54.376]  orchestrate what these evil men do.
[01:39:54.516 --> 01:40:02.100]  So, I mean, that tells me that Satan himself is the one that's actually, you know, the genius behind it all.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:09.904]  Well, of course, the devil's biggest trick was convincing us he didn't exist, and now you have moral relativism, and people, you know, don't even know what good and evil is.
[01:40:09.924 --> 01:40:10.784]  Thanks for the call, Debbie.
[01:40:11.745 --> 01:40:14.886]  And this is a fight, isn't it, about good and evil, Sharon?
[01:40:15.647 --> 01:40:16.307]  Absolutely.
[01:40:17.308 --> 01:40:18.048]  Absolutely it is.
[01:40:18.976 --> 01:40:20.937]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wyatt in Maryland.
[01:40:20.997 --> 01:40:22.318]  Wyatt, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:40:22.338 --> 01:40:22.698]  Go ahead.
[01:40:23.098 --> 01:40:34.425]  Hello, good afternoon, and best of luck to you, and I hope that you're successful, Sharon, in your endeavor to overturn this decision.
[01:40:35.345 --> 01:40:38.647]  The decision wasn't actually about abortion.
[01:40:38.667 --> 01:40:39.767]  It was about choice, wasn't it?
[01:40:39.787 --> 01:40:46.111]  In other words, the Supreme Court decision wasn't actually about the right to choose, not about abortion.
[01:40:48.095 --> 01:40:51.378]  Well, I think, again, Wyatt, that's getting into some semantics of it.
[01:40:51.838 --> 01:40:59.084]  I think what we're dealing with now is the results of a 30-year experiment, a social experiment, of abortion.
[01:41:00.006 --> 01:41:03.629]  I think we see now that it's a terrible thing and it's time for it to end.
[01:41:03.889 --> 01:41:04.950]  I don't think it was an experiment.
[01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:07.933]  I think it was a well-orchestrated plan.
[01:41:08.874 --> 01:41:18.141]  As Alex pointed out in the beginning of his show, just about the destruction of the family, according to a 1949 document that he was talking about.
[01:41:18.162 --> 01:41:20.764]  Yeah, this is UNESCO, and they said
[01:41:21.738 --> 01:41:39.797]  That a 10-part series for teachers published by UNESCO in 1949 under the title Towards World Understanding asserted that one of the chief aims of education today should be to prepare boys and girls to take an active part in the creation of world society, but government schools must stamp out love of country and family must be viewed as the enemy.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:46.790]  I think semantics can play an important part in all of this.
[01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:51.859]  I'm sure that the opposite side will be using semantics also.
[01:41:53.762 --> 01:41:55.943]  One gentleman kind of stole my thunder a little bit.
[01:41:56.123 --> 01:42:02.565]  According to the dictionary that I had, abortion was a natural miscarriage.
[01:42:03.065 --> 01:42:08.848]  And it's actually aborticide, which is a doctor-assisted or assisted type of abortion.
[01:42:09.508 --> 01:42:15.090]  And if you take aborticide and homicide, you might want to call it semantics, but it's still the same thing.
[01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:18.031]  So it is a form of homicide and genocide.
[01:42:18.587 --> 01:42:23.329]  So it's not... semantics can be used, and you could say, well... It's killing our young... That's right!
[01:42:23.509 --> 01:42:30.073]  ...in the tender womb, and they're totally... I mean, it's the equivalent of grabbing a kid off the street and going and cutting their arms and legs off.
[01:42:30.273 --> 01:42:30.693]  That's right.
[01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:35.175]  Okay, Alex, well, good luck to you, and I hope everything works out, and I'll be praying for you.
[01:42:35.375 --> 01:42:35.875]  Alright, thank you.
[01:42:35.895 --> 01:42:36.195]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:36.696 --> 01:42:37.296]  I appreciate it.
[01:42:37.816 --> 01:42:41.098]  So, how long until we find out what the Supreme Court's going to do with this?
[01:42:41.118 --> 01:42:43.859]  You say it's going into the appellate court in Dallas.
[01:42:43.899 --> 01:42:45.480]  How long until it gets up to the Supreme Court?
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.881]  Well, it's actually not in the appellate court, Alex.
[01:42:49.321 --> 01:42:56.904]  We filed this in the Federal District Court in Dallas, Texas, which was the court where the original filing was made.
[01:42:57.404 --> 01:43:07.888]  Now, this may be a little more detailed than you were looking for, but basically the court there has to make a decision whether they're going to have one judge hear the case or if they're going to
[01:43:08.453 --> 01:43:10.034]  convene a three-judge panel.
[01:43:10.454 --> 01:43:21.738]  There was a statute in place at the time of the original ruling that called for a three-judge panel in any case declaring or challenging the constitutionality of a state statute.
[01:43:21.818 --> 01:43:31.601]  And so they could now rule then that the abortion is illegal and then what area of the country would then have a ban on abortion?
[01:43:31.881 --> 01:43:33.862]  And then you'd have an appeal go to the Supreme Court.
[01:43:33.922 --> 01:43:34.442]  How does this work?
[01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:50.065]  Well, if the court chooses to convene a three-judge panel and that panel makes a ruling either for or against, there is a direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court for any ruling from a three-judge court.
[01:43:50.445 --> 01:43:55.210]  Now, if the Federal District Court chooses to only have one judge hear the case,
[01:43:55.885 --> 01:44:03.071]  Then, after that ruling, the case would then be appealed to an appellate court, and then to the Supreme Court, if necessary.
[01:44:03.191 --> 01:44:05.093]  So we're talking about years here?
[01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:08.055]  It could be years, or it could be one year.
[01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.157]  Millions more dead children.
[01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:10.657]  Right.
[01:44:11.598 --> 01:44:12.498]  We have to wait.
[01:44:13.199 --> 01:44:22.807]  The federal district court here has a lot of decisions to make, and sometimes these things just move very, very swiftly, and other times they get bogged down.
[01:44:22.827 --> 01:44:25.429]  Well, how do we lobby to make sure it moves quickly?
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:32.767]  Well, I suppose... It's a lot more important than can a school teacher wear a dress.
[01:44:33.107 --> 01:44:33.688]  They're a man.
[01:44:33.728 --> 01:44:36.992]  You know, they've got cases like that, I know, in the courts.
[01:44:37.572 --> 01:44:37.833]  Right.
[01:44:38.193 --> 01:44:46.603]  I don't anticipate they're going to sit on it too long because the longer they sit on it, the more support is going to swell on both sides and we could be in the middle of a
[01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:49.333]  More, even more of a firestorm than we're in.
[01:44:49.393 --> 01:44:50.375]  Godspeed to you.
[01:44:50.435 --> 01:44:51.356]  We'll be praying for you.
[01:44:51.396 --> 01:44:54.621]  We really appreciate Sharon Blakely for joining us.
[01:44:54.701 --> 01:44:55.182]  Take care.
[01:44:55.562 --> 01:44:56.003]  Thank you.
[01:44:56.263 --> 01:44:56.724]  You bet.
[01:44:56.904 --> 01:44:57.425]  I'll come back.
[01:44:57.465 --> 01:44:59.228]  Got some comments on this and some other news.
[01:44:59.248 --> 01:45:00.730]  We'll go to the next hour with another guest.
[01:45:02.339 --> 01:45:06.685]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:45:06.865 --> 01:45:11.291]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:45:11.451 --> 01:45:15.857]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:45:15.877 --> 01:45:17.198]  The New World Order.
[01:45:18.986 --> 01:45:23.212]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:45:23.272 --> 01:45:30.223]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:45:30.343 --> 01:45:32.346]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:45:32.927 --> 01:45:43.153]  Plan security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:45:43.333 --> 01:45:48.696]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:46:12.836 --> 01:46:20.361]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:20.621 --> 01:46:20.962]  I think so.
[01:46:36.445 --> 01:46:37.606]  Remember what it was like to get up
[01:47:02.739 --> 01:47:04.780]  You can't get up in the morning without pain and stiffness in your joints.
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:12.625]  If it's been too long since your life has been active and pain-free, this is your chance to experience the pain-relieving power of Joint Wise Cream absolutely free.

[01:47:38.624 --> 01:47:43.008]  Why not let Joint Wise Cream speed pain relief to your aching muscles and joints risk-free.
[01:47:43.308 --> 01:47:44.629]  Alright, we're back live, folks.
[01:48:11.986 --> 01:48:16.028]  This is a testament to what can happen if you get involved and keep pushing.
[01:48:16.969 --> 01:48:19.130]  We could see Roe v. Wade overturn.
[01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:27.734]  But, I predict that we'll be lucky if we get a ban on partial birth abortion.
[01:48:29.835 --> 01:48:33.217]  And I want to say blessed because it's just sick what's happening.
[01:48:33.897 --> 01:48:36.719]  God wants it all stopped and humanity should want it all stopped.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:38.960]  But,
[01:48:42.535 --> 01:48:44.876]  Just watch the type of judges Bush puts in there.
[01:48:44.976 --> 01:48:52.040]  I mean, the guy just signed on to UNESCO that worldwide is killing hundreds of millions of children every decade through abortion.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.720]  Hundreds of millions.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:57.762]  It dwarfs the 54 million in this country.
[01:48:57.822 --> 01:49:04.805]  And I know a lot of you have abortions out there, and so you've tried to rationalize what's happening, but you've got this pain in your heart, in your stomach, in your mind.
[01:49:05.266 --> 01:49:12.209]  Why don't you repent and ask God for forgiveness, and beg the baby for forgiveness, and you'll be forgiven.
[01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:14.531]  You'll be forgiven.
[01:49:16.292 --> 01:49:18.613]  Like the thief hanging on the cross next to Christ.
[01:49:18.693 --> 01:49:20.254]  Folks, you really can be forgiven.
[01:49:20.314 --> 01:49:21.834]  It was a human being you killed.
[01:49:22.715 --> 01:49:25.076]  Stop being a party to the murder of other children.
[01:49:25.236 --> 01:49:26.677]  Join us in the fight against this.
[01:49:28.044 --> 01:49:32.466]  By the way, street preachers now on public streets are being beat up by police and arrested nationwide.
[01:49:32.486 --> 01:49:34.366]  I'm going to be getting some of those guests on.
[01:49:34.386 --> 01:49:35.927]  This is confirmed mainstream news.
[01:49:36.287 --> 01:49:38.488]  They're banning political protest of almost any type.
[01:49:38.788 --> 01:49:45.710]  The feds carry out the abortion clinic bombings from all the evidence we have, and then blame it on Christians and try to demonize those that are against abortion.
[01:49:47.259 --> 01:49:49.920]  The Feds are going to do this with biometrics, I have no doubt.
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:56.724]  As you complain about biometrics in the Cashless Society, they'll form terror groups that blow stuff up, protesting against biometrics.
[01:49:56.744 --> 01:49:59.465]  Then, oh, if you're against biometrics, you're with the terrorists.
[01:49:59.965 --> 01:50:00.946]  This is how they do it.
[01:50:00.986 --> 01:50:03.747]  You're against the New World Order, you're a terrorist.
[01:50:03.827 --> 01:50:04.247]  See?
[01:50:04.408 --> 01:50:05.788]  This is the globalist tactic.
[01:50:05.928 --> 01:50:08.109]  We've proven it in hundreds of cases.
[01:50:10.551 --> 01:50:11.091]  And, uh...
[01:50:11.718 --> 01:50:18.567]  You know, even people on the left are waking up and coming out against abortion because they've had abortions, they know it's wrong, the health risk, all of it.
[01:50:19.028 --> 01:50:19.949]  It's time to repent.
[01:50:20.009 --> 01:50:21.572]  It's time to have some decency!
[01:50:22.453 --> 01:50:23.935]  It's time to not kill children!
[01:50:26.334 --> 01:50:27.895]  And all this life of the mother stuff.
[01:50:28.396 --> 01:50:44.468]  I mean, if a surgery needs to take place, and a baby, you know, was lodged, killing the mother, and in the surgery they remove the human being, the baby and the mother dies, and the baby dies, or the mother lives, the baby dies, then that's not an abortion.
[01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:51.794]  So, you know, before the mother was in risk, they'd go in and do a surgery, it wasn't called an abortion, it was a surgery and the baby died.
[01:50:52.634 --> 01:50:54.316]  This is abortion, this is sick!
[01:50:55.296 --> 01:50:56.057]  This is sick!
[01:50:57.938 --> 01:51:06.803]  And Trent Lott was going to pass the same version as the House last year, and Bush got mad and told him to not bring up that ban on partial birth abortions.
[01:51:06.843 --> 01:51:10.105]  So there's a lot of sneakiness going on, and I look at Bush's actions.
[01:51:11.506 --> 01:51:14.527]  Claims he's against abortion here, funds it worldwide.
[01:51:15.388 --> 01:51:19.110]  So it's like saying, OK, I'm not going to kill this kid, but I'm going to bash the brains out of 100,000.
[01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:23.452]  So I'm good because I saved this one kid, but I'm going to kill all these other kids.
[01:51:23.852 --> 01:51:24.653]  It's a sick joke.
[01:51:25.819 --> 01:51:32.786]  Before I end this hour and come back with your calls and another guest, I hope you'll all go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:33.146 --> 01:51:43.437]  I hope you'll get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, my new film, 2 hours and 40 minutes, professionally produced, and your purchase supports this broadcast, and you're authorized for not-for-profit

[01:51:52.885 --> 01:52:01.392]  Police State 3 covers government-sponsored terror, homeland security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, executive orders, forced inoculations, gun control.
[01:52:01.472 --> 01:52:02.333]  It goes on and on.
[01:52:02.753 --> 01:52:05.856]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:15.200]  Get the word out.
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:16.241]  Wake people up.
[01:52:22.123 --> 01:52:22.443]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:22.463 --> 01:52:28.346]  Don't wait.
[01:52:28.746 --> 01:52:31.547]  Don't stand idly by and let these terrorists carry out their murder.
[01:52:31.867 --> 01:52:32.848]  Expose the terrorist.
[01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:34.088]  Get the videos.
[01:52:34.108 --> 01:52:35.009]  888-253-3139.
[01:52:35.829 --> 01:52:44.253]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:52:45.274 --> 01:52:47.274]  Or infowars.com or net.
[01:52:47.695 --> 01:52:48.755]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:52:48.775 --> 01:52:50.196]  Your calls and guests and a bunch of news.
[01:52:50.216 --> 01:52:50.596]  Stay with me.
[01:52:53.951 --> 01:52:58.434]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:52:58.774 --> 01:53:02.857]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:53:03.157 --> 01:53:03.597]  We water.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:10.522]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:18.139 --> 01:53:18.779]  Big Brother.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.520]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:21.201 --> 01:53:22.302]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:22.982 --> 01:53:23.783]  You want answers?
[01:53:24.544 --> 01:53:25.444]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:25.464 --> 01:53:29.768]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:30.288 --> 01:53:34.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.094 --> 01:53:37.914]  All right, folks.
[01:53:37.934 --> 01:53:41.257]  We're back live already into the second, third hour.
[01:53:41.277 --> 01:53:41.778]  Third hour.
[01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:50.617]  And we do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central and then back from 9 to midnight central on the AM and FM dial.
[01:53:51.158 --> 01:53:52.759]  Global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 9320.
[01:53:52.879 --> 01:53:54.200]  And at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[01:53:54.301 --> 01:53:56.202]  And your calls are coming up in this hour at 800-259-9231.
[01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:18.826]  Bush claims he's against abortion, but he signed on to UNESCO, the world harbinger of abortion, funding hundreds of millions of abortions just in the last decade alone.
[01:54:20.789 --> 01:54:22.251]  So, it's very serious.
[01:54:22.691 --> 01:54:23.152]  We had
[01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:35.127]  Well, Jane Roe's attorney on, her real name is Norma McCorvey, she's now a born-again Christian, worked in the death mills, is against what happened, and says it harms women and children.
[01:54:35.507 --> 01:54:45.750]  We had her lawyer, Sharon Blakeney, on to talk about Roe v. Wade and how it's now in the federal courts, because she's allowed to petition on the same case and try to get that overturned.
[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:53.673]  And as you heard from our guest, the neocons on Fox, they're going, well, this will fail because Roe v. Wade was about an individual case.
[01:54:54.353 --> 01:54:56.715]  No, it wasn't, neocon liars!
[01:54:57.015 --> 01:54:59.256]  It was used for abortion nationwide!
[01:55:01.498 --> 01:55:14.746]  So that's coming up, and you watch Bush play some little tricks here and drop the ball on purpose, because he's, well, with one hand, saving a few children, maybe, with the other hand, committing millions to death camps.
[01:55:15.587 --> 01:55:17.308]  Committing millions to instant death.
[01:55:18.889 --> 01:55:19.629]  In the womb.
[01:55:20.850 --> 01:55:21.991]  So that's coming up.
[01:55:24.525 --> 01:55:27.387]  The left is starting to find out about election fraud.
[01:55:27.407 --> 01:55:38.496]  I'm seeing a lot of mainstream left-wing websites talking about touchscreen systems that Chuckie Schumer and Bush are putting in that are totally fraud-ridden, no record of how you voted, just incredible corruption.
[01:55:38.536 --> 01:55:41.518]  Globalist companies own the companies that produce these machines.
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:46.882]  And to talk about this and a bunch of other forms of election fraud,
[01:55:49.396 --> 01:55:59.262]  And how the disenfranchised left is introducing commercials with a conscience, airing now on CNN, A&E and VH1.
[01:56:00.062 --> 01:56:13.130]  Joining us in the next segment is Michelle Schacht, the big bluegrass and blues gold platinum record celebrity, I guess.
[01:56:13.726 --> 01:56:17.187]  That's a weird way to say it, but a recording artist.
[01:56:17.247 --> 01:56:21.648]  While Texas born, Michelle was born and bred in tradition of bluegrass and blues and swing.
[01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:28.629]  She became a true British pop phenomenon and she's involved with Greg Pallast and others trying to expose the corruption.
[01:56:29.929 --> 01:56:37.071]  And so we'll talk about it and see where she's coming from in the next segment.
[01:56:37.091 --> 01:56:38.851]  Have her on for about 20 minutes or so.
[01:56:39.711 --> 01:56:42.192]  And then I'm going to get back into all the global news.
[01:56:43.223 --> 01:56:56.558]  And, uh, what's developing around the world and some of the news I never got to yesterday, like Orrin Hatch wanting the government to have backdoors to hack into all your computers in the name of stopping illegal downloads of music and software.
[01:56:58.735 --> 01:57:00.536]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:57:01.116 --> 01:57:03.876]  Want to go ahead and get on board and get lined up to get on air?
[01:57:03.936 --> 01:57:11.739]  The toll-free number to join me on this live Thursday edition of the World Wide Broadcast 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and I will get you up and on the air.
[01:57:11.759 --> 01:57:13.219]  And then coming up
[01:57:24.409 --> 01:57:28.411]  More on war with North Korea and Iran and Syria on the horizon.
[01:57:28.431 --> 01:57:34.633]  More lying about weapons of mass destruction as the government's been caught red-handed.
[01:57:34.653 --> 01:57:37.654]  1,500 families sued over the deadly measles, mumps, rubella shot.
[01:57:38.614 --> 01:57:40.215]  And just a ton of information.
[01:57:40.979 --> 01:57:47.581]  about genetically engineered food, that they're now going to be planting all over the country, and much much more.
[01:57:47.681 --> 01:57:50.862]  But the number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:57:51.622 --> 01:57:55.104]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:55.124 --> 01:58:00.905]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, and Infowars.com.
[01:58:00.925 --> 01:58:05.747]  Be sure and visit those websites and support us if you believe in what we're doing in this
[01:58:07.009 --> 01:58:11.513]  Life and death battle against the forces of the new world order.
[01:58:13.695 --> 01:58:19.840]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:58:20.578 --> 01:58:26.400]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.060]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:35.542]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:58:35.802 --> 01:58:40.003]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:58:40.223 --> 01:58:42.585]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:58:42.765 --> 01:58:47.489]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[01:58:47.689 --> 01:58:54.615]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets, and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:58.078]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[01:58:58.338 --> 01:59:01.741]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:59:03.983 --> 01:59:07.046]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:07.727 --> 01:59:09.189]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:59:09.449 --> 01:59:10.370]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:19.419]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:20.820]  That's right, folks.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:21.461]  DVD.
[01:59:21.661 --> 01:59:23.882]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:59:24.022 --> 01:59:26.103]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:59:26.383 --> 01:59:31.326]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:59:31.646 --> 01:59:35.688]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:59:35.948 --> 01:59:37.709]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:48.434]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:59:48.594 --> 01:59:50.495]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:59:50.695 --> 01:59:54.537]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.
[01:59:54.657 --> 01:59:56.078]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:59:56.138 --> 01:59:56.318]  That's 888-2533139.
[02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:06.408]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:00:06.428 --> 02:00:07.730]  I'll give them that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:16.020]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:17.681]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:00:18.161 --> 02:00:19.602]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:00:19.862 --> 02:00:25.045]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:00:25.405 --> 02:00:29.888]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:00:30.208 --> 02:00:38.832]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:00:39.753 --> 02:00:40.473]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:00:40.954 --> 02:00:44.716]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:00:44.996 --> 02:00:51.620]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:55.982]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[02:00:56.422 --> 02:00:58.403]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[02:00:58.663 --> 02:00:59.444]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[02:00:59.464 --> 02:00:59.784]  That's 800-569-4340.
[02:00:59.804 --> 02:01:01.265]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:20.792]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:01:21.372 --> 02:01:24.413]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:27.314 --> 02:01:39.638]  We've had award-winning BBC News and I investigative journalist Greg Pallis, who's an American, on four or five times and he's dropped just huge bombshells on us.
[02:01:40.333 --> 02:01:48.656]  Declassified IMF World Bank documents where they say they want to implode our economies, take our pension funds, literally set up dictatorships.
[02:01:50.177 --> 02:01:51.237]  It's their own documents.
[02:01:52.258 --> 02:01:59.821]  And they've even come out and admitted that Greg Powell has accurate documents, but said, well, you know, he's just putting a bad light on them.
[02:02:00.741 --> 02:02:05.443]  He's also exposed election fraud by Republicans and Democrats in Choice Point,
[02:02:06.544 --> 02:02:16.507]  Uh, working for President Bush in the election in Florida, then getting all these big government contracts, running a bunch of other scams, and it really is important information.
[02:02:17.007 --> 02:02:26.930]  In fact, I've seen the left wing here in Austin, the phony left wing, just like we have the phony neocon conservatives, they're all really on the same team, attack Greg Palast.
[02:02:27.811 --> 02:02:32.273]  In the Chronicle, in Austin last week, they attacked myself and Greg Palast.
[02:02:32.833 --> 02:02:38.595]  Didn't say Greg was wrong about anything, just said, oh well, he's wrong because he criticizes Democrats too.
[02:02:40.076 --> 02:02:45.398]  It's this mindless left-right stuff that keeps the corrupt, globalist New World Order agenda moving forward.
[02:02:46.198 --> 02:02:56.322]  And one of Greg Palast's associates involved in the fight against this globalization is Michelle Schott.
[02:02:57.236 --> 02:03:08.326]  And she, of course, is a best-selling British pop phenomenon and swing, blues, bluegrass, and a bunch of other music.
[02:03:08.486 --> 02:03:13.390]  And she's been an activist involved in just a whole bunch of different areas.
[02:03:14.211 --> 02:03:23.318]  And she's now involved with a group that is introducing commercials with a conscience, airing now on CNN, A&E, and VH1.
[02:03:24.631 --> 02:03:34.213]  And their press release says, you probably heard about this in the news, as the media continues to be owned and operated by a small, biased minority, it's not free market either, I would add.
[02:03:34.253 --> 02:03:39.774]  The need increases for a forum that can expose alternative truths and opinions.
[02:03:39.914 --> 02:03:45.995]  So, we're talking about alternative information and to tell us about it is Michelle Schacht.
[02:03:46.075 --> 02:03:47.976]  And I appreciate you coming on the show, Michelle.
[02:03:48.236 --> 02:03:49.996]  It's my pleasure, Alex, and being a
[02:03:50.754 --> 02:03:55.857]  A UT alumni there in Austin, it's good to kind of, by phone, be back at home.
[02:03:56.457 --> 02:03:57.258]  Where are you now?
[02:03:57.578 --> 02:04:02.541]  I'm in Los Angeles and I'm working with this group, Commercials with a Conscience.
[02:04:02.681 --> 02:04:12.386]  Actually, people should go to the website standupnow.org if they kind of want to trace the roots of this grassroots citizens initiative.
[02:04:12.907 --> 02:04:17.149]  But a lot of us are, of course, out here in the Citizens Republic of California.
[02:04:18.485 --> 02:04:22.266]  Absolutely, and Greg Pallas and others are involved.
[02:04:23.286 --> 02:04:25.046]  What is the organization trying to do?
[02:04:25.066 --> 02:04:26.786]  What are the commercials focused on?
[02:04:27.107 --> 02:04:29.087]  Well, you've got to play fire with fire, man.
[02:04:29.547 --> 02:04:38.869]  And if the media is being bought and sold by elites, well, the next best thing, I guess, citizens can do is organize and collaborate and come together.
[02:04:39.089 --> 02:04:43.949]  And we've put together a commercial, and we're just outraged.
[02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:46.910]  We are outraged by the encroachments on
[02:04:47.672 --> 02:04:51.155]  Not just our civil liberties, but our way of life as Americans.
[02:04:52.596 --> 02:05:04.344]  Well, Ashcroft, two and a half months ago before Congress, the House and Senate, in two separate committees, read off a page and told the Congress, there is no Patriot Act 2.
[02:05:04.924 --> 02:05:06.705]  Patriot Act 1 doesn't affect citizens.
[02:05:07.506 --> 02:05:11.589]  Then on Monday, the Justice Department released a brief and said, yes,
[02:05:12.245 --> 02:05:18.988]  We will use it for all crimes, against everyone, no more Bill of Rights, secret arrest, everything.
[02:05:19.008 --> 02:05:30.772]  Now we already knew that was in the bills because we've read it, but to have them lying and then admitting they have a Patriot Act too, and now saying, okay, it is against citizens, does that concern you?
[02:05:31.652 --> 02:05:36.234]  It concerns me, and it concerns every American who cherishes our way of life.
[02:05:36.554 --> 02:05:41.476]  When we sing that song, Our Sweet Land of Liberty, we're not saying empty words, we really mean it.
[02:05:42.665 --> 02:05:47.093]  And I'll tell you what, this Help Americans Vote Act is the one that's got my dander up.
[02:05:47.611 --> 02:05:57.837]  Because they're now proposing that we adopt the Florida model for our voting system, and that really is what's lit the fire under the commercials with the conscience.
[02:05:57.877 --> 02:06:12.346]  We're saying this is a tyranny, and in the Constitution we are, by citizens, we are by rights supposed to oppose any tyranny which breaches these shores, and we've got one sitting in the White House.
[02:06:12.786 --> 02:06:15.428]  Well, that's certainly in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:06:17.992 --> 02:06:25.536]  Chuckie Schumer and George Bush collaborated together to fund the federalization of elections, to put in the touchscreen systems.
[02:06:26.096 --> 02:06:35.241]  Lawsuits have been filed by Republicans and Democrats saying there's no record of a vote, it's totally fraud driven, with modems hooked into the federal government.
[02:06:36.391 --> 02:06:39.213]  It's just a black box, and they tell you who wins.
[02:06:39.293 --> 02:06:46.156]  So, out of the crisis in Florida, which they created, now they're going to, in the name of a solution, take over the whole system.
[02:06:46.176 --> 02:06:47.117]  What are you concerned about?
[02:06:47.637 --> 02:06:49.418]  Alex, there's no paper trail.
[02:06:50.099 --> 02:07:05.147]  And, on top of that, it's handled by partisan elected officials who, you can see from the Florida model, have nothing but their own interests in mind when they keep this system in place, where they scrub voter lists.
[02:07:05.771 --> 02:07:26.120]  You know, Kathleen Harris, she deliberately squashed the previous service that was scrubbing the lists when they noticed that there were some discrepancies that one person who'd been a felon in some other state would take out ten voters in Florida because they had similar names, not even the same names.
[02:07:28.459 --> 02:07:35.885]  Well, now we've caught this government front choice point involved buying the names of Latin Americans for elections.
[02:07:38.387 --> 02:07:45.692]  And of course, choice points now have been given contracts by Bush, and Harris has been given a lot of perks for doing this.
[02:07:45.712 --> 02:07:48.274]  Now understand, I wasn't for Al Gore or George Bush.
[02:07:48.775 --> 02:07:51.597]  They're two sides of the same coin, but we do see the corruption
[02:07:52.871 --> 02:07:53.131]  I'm good.
[02:08:01.165 --> 02:08:03.967]  What is your organization calling for?
[02:08:04.007 --> 02:08:08.430]  Getting rid of the touchscreen systems or getting federal control out of the states?
[02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:09.211]  What are you calling for?
[02:08:09.571 --> 02:08:25.983]  Essentially, we're calling for citizens to take action, come together, and standupnow.org, if you go on that website, you will see that we're proposing all manner of citizens initiatives, but obviously elected officials have been bought and sold by corporations.
[02:08:26.063 --> 02:08:27.724]  They're running amok with our government.
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:44.747]  And this is a democracy by the people, for the people, and of the people, and commercials with the conscience is just one part of a strategy to organize and coalesce the citizens who this country really belongs to, not the elite who try to buy and sell the democracy.
[02:08:45.107 --> 02:08:53.590]  Sure, we're talking to Michelle Schacht, a best-selling pop phenomenon, and she's been a social activist for a long time.
[02:08:53.610 --> 02:08:57.212]  I would tell you, though, Michelle, that the difference between a democracy
[02:08:57.932 --> 02:09:08.681]  In a constitutional republic, in a pure democracy, you would have 51% of the people saying black people can be slaves again and they become slaves.
[02:09:08.721 --> 02:09:13.385]  In our republic, you were talking about the Declaration, Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[02:09:14.806 --> 02:09:20.931]  Under that, everyone's rights are protected and certainly our republic is being dismantled.
[02:09:22.771 --> 02:09:25.892]  But Alex, I don't have time to split hairs over that.
[02:09:26.212 --> 02:09:39.495]  The fact that we go along with a decision by the Supreme Court, because they are supposed to represent fairness and balance, means that we allow for four years this guy to run amok in the White House.
[02:09:39.756 --> 02:09:41.096]  But come the next election,
[02:09:42.217 --> 02:09:44.659]  I don't even buy into the whole electoral system.
[02:09:44.679 --> 02:09:50.685]  You know, why do we need to have a representative determining what the popular vote should be distilled down to?
[02:09:50.705 --> 02:09:51.866]  I don't buy into any of that.
[02:09:51.886 --> 02:09:53.327]  Let me tell you why we have that.
[02:09:53.347 --> 02:09:57.431]  I mean, I agree with much of what you're saying, but some of the key issues I don't.
[02:09:58.251 --> 02:09:59.553]  It's about states' rights.
[02:10:00.554 --> 02:10:09.864]  You will get a dictatorship, take the 17th Amendment, that took our senators from the states and made them creatures of the federal government and destroyed local control.
[02:10:10.305 --> 02:10:11.266]  That's why we have that.
[02:10:11.686 --> 02:10:12.667]  But you know what it's like?
[02:10:12.748 --> 02:10:13.789]  It's called mother wit.
[02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:15.290]  That's what we say in Texas.
[02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:16.492]  You've got common sense.
[02:10:17.392 --> 02:10:26.956]  And people will go along with tyranny for so long, and once it becomes so blatant, they will throw the key chest into the Boston heart.
[02:10:26.976 --> 02:10:31.798]  Well, that's true, but they've got to know what the real corruption is.
[02:10:31.918 --> 02:10:32.879]  Now, I agree with you.
[02:10:32.919 --> 02:10:35.260]  I mean, Bush is setting up a dictatorship.
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.221]  He's the worst president that's ever been in office, but he's a puppet.
[02:10:39.781 --> 02:10:42.323]  It's the corporations you talked about that are not free market.
[02:10:42.343 --> 02:10:45.824]  I mean, there's a trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon.
[02:10:47.083 --> 02:10:49.984]  Seven million dollar contract for Dick Cheney in Iraq.
[02:10:50.024 --> 02:10:50.884]  No bids allowed.
[02:10:51.844 --> 02:10:53.544]  And I hear what you're saying.
[02:10:53.944 --> 02:10:58.185]  So, what specifically is your organization calling for?
[02:10:58.225 --> 02:11:00.305]  Just trying to raise the awareness about this?
[02:11:01.126 --> 02:11:08.967]  Well, there's been so much propaganda, hype, brainwash, manipulation in the media that we're fighting fire with fire.
[02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:13.828]  Commercials with a Conscience is bought and paid for and produced by citizens
[02:11:14.502 --> 02:11:23.204]  Dealing directly with these citizens' initiatives, voter fraud, government corruption.
[02:11:23.504 --> 02:11:30.726]  We'll have a whole list of issues that we can address, but the way we're going about it is, as I say, fighting fire with fire.
[02:11:30.986 --> 02:11:36.648]  We're buying media time, just like the corporate elites do, and so we're calling on citizens
[02:11:37.208 --> 02:11:53.213]  Not only to help us with their financial contributions, but to get involved, make connections, citizen to citizen, to start a grassroots revolution, a fundamental movement for social change in this country.
[02:11:55.034 --> 02:11:55.754]  Well, I know this.
[02:11:55.834 --> 02:12:05.877]  Somebody's got to be brought to justice, because if you don't bring criminals to justice, the corruption just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and it's a race straight to the bottom.
[02:12:07.262 --> 02:12:16.851]  I mean, look, George Bush blocked Dan Burton's committee from investigating Clinton pardoning convicted cocaine dealers and money launderers, and now the Democrats are protecting Bush.
[02:12:16.871 --> 02:12:18.873]  They're not contesting what happened with that election.
[02:12:19.553 --> 02:12:24.858]  Do you guys understand that at the committee, chairman, and above level, it doesn't matter if they're Republicans or Democrats?
[02:12:25.318 --> 02:12:26.519]  I got you covered, Alex.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:28.281]  We're not partisan in that sense.
[02:12:28.601 --> 02:12:30.383]  We're dealing with an oligarchy.
[02:12:30.643 --> 02:12:31.544]  Did I say oligarchy?
[02:12:31.972 --> 02:12:33.292]  I meant an oligarchy.
[02:12:34.553 --> 02:12:38.574]  This government is being bought and sold long, long ago, quite frankly.
[02:12:38.654 --> 02:12:39.314]  I agree with you.
[02:12:39.794 --> 02:12:46.276]  It's becoming blatantly obvious to even, you know, East Texas hillbillies like me at this point.
[02:12:46.736 --> 02:12:47.976]  We see what time it is.
[02:12:48.116 --> 02:12:50.477]  Alright, Michelle Schacht, can you stay with us for another segment?
[02:12:50.857 --> 02:12:51.177]  Sure.
[02:12:51.497 --> 02:12:53.298]  Alright, we'll come back with Michelle Schacht.
[02:12:55.234 --> 02:12:56.395]  You know, they're doing some good work.
[02:12:56.415 --> 02:13:02.141]  They're getting people to think about election fraud, to think about government corruption, to become aware that this is going on.
[02:13:03.022 --> 02:13:08.107]  I'm telling you folks, we're inches away from not even having local elections if they put these federal touchscreens in.
[02:13:08.787 --> 02:13:09.688]  Just understand that.
[02:13:10.269 --> 02:13:12.531]  We'll be right back with her information.
[02:13:14.818 --> 02:13:19.321]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:19.662 --> 02:13:23.765]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:24.045 --> 02:13:24.605]  We listened.
[02:13:24.905 --> 02:13:29.889]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:30.650]  We listened.
[02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:34.072]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:34.492 --> 02:13:35.013]  We listened.
[02:13:35.473 --> 02:13:39.554]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:13:39.914 --> 02:13:40.414]  We listened.
[02:13:40.754 --> 02:13:45.995]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:13:46.415 --> 02:13:47.776]  Again, we listened.
[02:13:48.136 --> 02:13:49.716]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:13:49.896 --> 02:13:55.517]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:11.292]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:15:12.515 --> 02:15:16.778]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:17.219 --> 02:15:21.762]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:22.143 --> 02:15:27.006]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:27.387 --> 02:15:29.168]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:29.228 --> 02:15:30.249]  can barely be read.
[02:15:30.529 --> 02:15:31.490]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:35.753]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[02:15:36.014 --> 02:15:44.380]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[02:16:12.006 --> 02:16:14.507]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[02:16:14.847 --> 02:16:20.489]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[02:16:20.769 --> 02:16:26.070]  You haven't alkalized your body and in fact you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:32.092]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:16:32.212 --> 02:16:34.593]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[02:16:34.913 --> 02:16:37.494]  Finally, you don't consume iodized water.
[02:16:37.774 --> 02:16:45.156]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[02:16:45.436 --> 02:16:49.558]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:16:49.838 --> 02:16:58.561]  If you want to learn more on how you can naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Monday through Friday mornings at 9 a.m.
[02:16:58.581 --> 02:16:59.801]  Central, 10 Eastern.

[02:17:08.969 --> 02:17:11.411]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[02:17:25.984 --> 02:17:28.626]  Across the board, Americans are starting to wake up.
[02:17:30.945 --> 02:17:39.707]  And I agree with our guest, Michelle Schacht, that we do have an oligarchy in this country, but it's more than an oilarchy.
[02:17:39.807 --> 02:17:41.767]  It's a weapons salesarchy.
[02:17:42.267 --> 02:17:44.628]  It's a private prison industryarchy.
[02:17:45.408 --> 02:17:47.728]  It is a tyrannyarchy.
[02:17:48.409 --> 02:17:51.409]  It is a currency speculationarchy.
[02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:55.730]  It is massive corruption that wants it all and wants it now.
[02:17:56.610 --> 02:17:58.150]  And they are setting up a police state.
[02:17:58.210 --> 02:18:00.631]  And I tell you, Michelle, that was exciting what you said about
[02:18:01.271 --> 02:18:10.496]  The point about losing our liberties, our freedoms, is that you guys are involved in exposing the Patriot Act and some of the things they're doing.
[02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:23.683]  We're trusting that citizens are reading, getting their information from sites such as gregpalast.com, that they're getting their information from programs like yours, that they're connecting the dots themselves.
[02:18:23.763 --> 02:18:26.344]  We don't underestimate people's intelligence.
[02:18:26.525 --> 02:18:29.046]  All we're trying to do is get them to come together
[02:18:29.662 --> 02:18:44.047]  And to start creating a foment, a motion, a movement that, in our particular case, standupnow.org encourages people to fight fire with fire with regard to media.
[02:18:44.387 --> 02:18:54.951]  That it's bought and sold, and your average citizen would look at the media and think, oh, I could never afford commercial airtime on VH1 or, you know, CNN or whatever.
[02:18:55.327 --> 02:18:56.108]  And we're saying no.
[02:18:56.168 --> 02:18:56.608]  You know what?
[02:18:56.768 --> 02:18:59.630]  One person can't, but a whole bunch of us together can.
[02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:04.734]  We're assuming that the issues that we address will be obvious to everyone.
[02:19:04.914 --> 02:19:14.341]  By the time we get around to making a commercial like the one we did for Commercials with a Conscience, it's a general call to arms to say, enough is enough.
[02:19:14.681 --> 02:19:16.943]  You're a tyrant and we're calling you bluff.
[02:19:18.143 --> 02:19:21.506]  Well, the evidence is clear that the administration
[02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:26.972]  Is the front for the military-industrial complex that carried out September 11th.
[02:19:27.472 --> 02:19:29.333]  Michelle, were you aware of that information?
[02:19:29.353 --> 02:19:30.814]  Yeah, and you know where I got it from?
[02:19:30.894 --> 02:19:33.555]  One of my favorite, favorite books of all time.
[02:19:33.675 --> 02:19:34.716]  I don't know if it's available.
[02:19:34.756 --> 02:19:36.397]  Yeah, I think it's available retail, too.
[02:19:37.237 --> 02:19:40.039]  It's called Addicted to War.
[02:19:40.099 --> 02:19:41.479]  You must know that one, Alex.
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:46.302]  Sure, I read it, and I'm glad to see it in the stores.
[02:19:46.362 --> 02:19:50.104]  But it isn't just Bush having prior knowledge, which is now coming out.
[02:19:50.144 --> 02:19:51.725]  I got some more news on that today.
[02:19:53.368 --> 02:19:56.149]  They funded and trained and ran the whole operation.
[02:19:56.990 --> 02:20:00.191]  And, uh, have you ever heard about the Northwoods document, Michelle?
[02:20:00.591 --> 02:20:02.212]  No, you caught me off guard on that, Al.
[02:20:02.232 --> 02:20:03.112]  Well, that's a U.S.
[02:20:03.153 --> 02:20:08.075]  government plan to carry out terror attacks, and they tell us why and how they would do this.
[02:20:09.615 --> 02:20:10.556]  Does that concern you?
[02:20:11.474 --> 02:20:16.844]  Well, you know, terrorism is supposed to be the big bugabear that frightens us all.
[02:20:16.864 --> 02:20:19.549]  It's like Thomas Paine or Thomas Jefferson.
[02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:23.256]  Anyone who gives up liberty for security deserves neither.
[02:20:24.747 --> 02:20:26.428]  Yeah, that was one of the founding fathers.
[02:20:26.568 --> 02:20:28.990]  Well, I mean, they tell us, give up liberty, you'll get security.
[02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:31.812]  When you give liberty up, you get tyranny.
[02:20:32.053 --> 02:20:33.594]  They're the threat to our liberty.
[02:20:34.254 --> 02:20:42.761]  And that was, remember, one of the threats that the terrorists made was that they could overtake the United States because we were an open society.
[02:20:43.221 --> 02:20:44.302]  Because we were too free.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:47.241]  And you've got the folks in Washington, D.C.
[02:20:47.261 --> 02:20:50.142]  saying, okay, well now we've got a justification.
[02:20:50.162 --> 02:20:51.703]  We're going to protect Americans from themselves.
[02:20:51.723 --> 02:20:56.145]  Oh yeah, the so-called statements from the terrorists just mesh perfectly with the government, what they want.
[02:20:56.185 --> 02:20:56.385]  Yeah.
[02:20:56.405 --> 02:20:56.905]  Yeah.
[02:20:56.925 --> 02:20:58.346]  Yeah, it just so happens.
[02:20:58.426 --> 02:21:02.548]  Well, look, I can only commend you guys.
[02:21:03.008 --> 02:21:06.670]  Who are some of the other people that are involved in your organization?
[02:21:09.477 --> 02:21:16.201]  I'm sorry I'm not real quick with the names here because it's a fairly umbrella organization.
[02:21:16.341 --> 02:21:24.426]  Well, there's Greg Pallast and many others here that I see that are involved, Michelle Schacht.
[02:21:24.726 --> 02:21:27.148]  And again, this is very, very exciting.
[02:21:28.749 --> 02:21:31.690]  And I hope that more people get involved in this.
[02:21:32.591 --> 02:21:34.192]  And obviously, that's going to start happening.
[02:21:34.795 --> 02:21:37.976]  Standupnow.org is the call to arms.
[02:21:38.336 --> 02:21:40.537]  Commercials with the Conscience is the result.
[02:21:40.577 --> 02:21:52.082]  You'll see the commercials broadcast, but if you go to standupnow.org, you will kind of see the infrastructure, how people are getting involved, and who's basically put their names on the line.
[02:21:52.102 --> 02:21:57.624]  Because now, you know, these anti-terrorist organizations could go and find our names and say, Aha!
[02:21:57.964 --> 02:21:58.965]  Arrest these citizens.
[02:21:58.985 --> 02:22:00.485]  That would be your worst nightmare, right?
[02:22:00.525 --> 02:22:01.546]  By taking action
[02:22:03.047 --> 02:22:10.651]  Well, they're not going to get away with that because we outnumber them and they are the terrorists.
[02:22:11.211 --> 02:22:14.413]  They carried out the terror attacks and we're going to expose that.
[02:22:14.453 --> 02:22:21.637]  You see, they don't care if we complain about Patriot Act 1 or 2 or any of this because they're going to carry out more terror and say, see, we told you so.
[02:22:22.018 --> 02:22:29.282]  If we don't explain who carried out the terror and who stands to gain from this, they're going to continue to carry the terror out and pose as our saviors.
[02:22:29.622 --> 02:22:32.503]  Were you aware of the Project for a New American Century, PNAC?
[02:22:33.564 --> 02:22:34.584]  You got me again, Alex.
[02:22:34.944 --> 02:22:45.329]  Well, this was a group that Bush formed, and they said, we need terrorist attacks in America to get people behind a global empire, imperial mobilization.
[02:22:46.690 --> 02:22:53.813]  Well, I really appreciate you joining us and taking time out from your career to defend this republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:22:54.173 --> 02:22:56.614]  And Michelle Schacht, Godspeed, and thanks for joining us.
[02:22:56.774 --> 02:22:57.534]  God bless you.
[02:22:57.995 --> 02:22:58.455]  Take care.
[02:22:59.142 --> 02:22:59.903]  I'll be right back.
[02:22:59.983 --> 02:23:01.484]  I'll cover news and take your calls.
[02:23:01.544 --> 02:23:01.984]  Stay with us.
[02:23:03.985 --> 02:23:04.866]  We're on the march.
[02:23:05.366 --> 02:23:06.967]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:07.888 --> 02:23:10.570]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:13.746 --> 02:23:16.769]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:22.015]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:23:22.255 --> 02:23:24.858]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they have been held.
[02:23:24.938 --> 02:23:27.141]  Call toll free 800-510-4074 or visit www.robertbarefoot.com
[02:23:37.444 --> 02:23:38.004]  Don't worry.
[02:23:38.425 --> 02:23:39.925]  This show is documented.
[02:23:40.465 --> 02:23:43.167]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:43.187 --> 02:23:52.311]  Yeah, it's painful to know the truth, but it's a lot more painful to ignore it and to keep stumbling headlong over the cliff like a fool.
[02:24:04.244 --> 02:24:05.926]  And yes, truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:24:06.427 --> 02:24:18.901]  Yes, governments are ruthless and corrupt and must be resisted, must be exposed, especially this illegitimate, enemy-combatant, terrorist government overthrowing America and replacing it with a high-tech slavery.
[02:24:20.427 --> 02:24:23.350]  We're about to go to Ron in Oklahoma and others that are patiently holding.
[02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:30.738]  If you'd like to get involved on air in the last 26 and a half minutes of this worldwide broadcast, the toll-free number to do so is 800-259-9231.
[02:24:30.898 --> 02:24:42.391]  And I do have some interesting news on genetic engineering, on uniform crime code statistics,
[02:24:43.266 --> 02:24:43.646]  I think?
[02:25:05.089 --> 02:25:08.950]  You know, we talk about getting control of our lives and a big way to do that is through health.
[02:25:09.490 --> 02:25:14.192]  And herbs and spices and essential oils are great nutrients.
[02:25:14.832 --> 02:25:27.535]  You're not getting the minerals and the vitamins and the cofactors and the enzymes you need out of the plants and animal products, the meats that you're eating.
[02:25:27.995 --> 02:25:30.056]  Because so much of the country is depleted.
[02:25:31.047 --> 02:25:38.196]  That's why you need to go to HerbalHealer.com, the global supplier with the largest selection I've seen anywhere.
[02:25:38.757 --> 02:25:40.780]  Bigger than any health food store you'll find.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:43.743]  Got most high quality products at great prices.
[02:25:44.204 --> 02:25:45.085]  They've been around since 1987.
[02:25:47.268 --> 02:25:53.492]  And they've also got classes you can take via CD-ROM on learning the herbs and spices.
[02:25:53.832 --> 02:25:57.114]  They have books on what grows naturally in your area.
[02:25:57.674 --> 02:25:59.095]  Great survival stuff.
[02:25:59.535 --> 02:26:04.999]  Great ways to plant an herb garden at your house, in the city, or in the country.
[02:26:05.019 --> 02:26:11.062]  Folks, it's a 120 page catalog, jam-packed with information.
[02:26:11.082 --> 02:26:11.202]  120 pages.
[02:26:11.222 --> 02:26:11.542]  It's a book.
[02:26:15.137 --> 02:26:15.977]  And it's free!
[02:26:16.217 --> 02:26:21.699]  You'll also get a free newsletter, monthly newsletter, jammed full of vital information.
[02:26:22.099 --> 02:26:23.680]  You need to take advantage of this.
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:25.900]  Call them right now at 870-269-4177.
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:26.701]  870-269-4177 or HerbalHealer.com.
[02:26:26.721 --> 02:26:27.861]  That's HerbalHealer.com or 870-269-4177.
[02:26:44.509 --> 02:26:51.774]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the free catalog and the free newsletter.
[02:26:52.415 --> 02:26:56.778]  Again, that number in case you missed it.
[02:26:56.798 --> 02:26:57.138]  870-269-4177.
[02:26:57.158 --> 02:27:01.221]  HerbalHealerAcademy and HerbalHealer.com.
[02:27:01.261 --> 02:27:05.724]  And then of course, briefly, I have produced nine full-length feature documentary films.
[02:27:06.264 --> 02:27:07.986]  My newest film is amazing.
[02:27:08.046 --> 02:27:08.366]  It's a
[02:27:09.771 --> 02:27:12.732]  Mind-opening, eye-opening event.
[02:27:12.872 --> 02:27:14.993]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:27:15.613 --> 02:27:17.673]  The most hardcore video I've made.
[02:27:18.314 --> 02:27:26.196]  Covers Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, Executive Orders, forced inoculations, government-run white slavery rings, gun control.
[02:27:28.425 --> 02:27:31.108]  Dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:27:31.388 --> 02:27:32.990]  It is an incredible film.
[02:27:33.470 --> 02:27:35.612]  It is two hours and 40 minutes long.
[02:27:35.652 --> 02:27:37.033]  It's really three films in one.
[02:27:37.073 --> 02:27:40.377]  I suggest you watch it in three 50-minute settings.
[02:27:40.897 --> 02:27:44.320]  Settings.
[02:27:44.341 --> 02:27:44.320]  $25.95.
[02:27:44.981 --> 02:27:47.444]  Order three or more of any of my nine videos.
[02:27:47.484 --> 02:27:49.145]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:27:49.445 --> 02:27:50.426]  That's a big discount.
[02:27:50.446 --> 02:27:50.947]  Do the math.
[02:27:52.196 --> 02:27:54.378]  Or call toll-free to get the videos at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:54.758]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:27:54.898 --> 02:27:55.359]  Take action.
[02:27:55.619 --> 02:27:57.140]  Get the videos.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:58.481]  Air them on AXS TV.
[02:27:58.501 --> 02:28:00.924]  Make copies for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[02:28:14.088 --> 02:28:16.989]  And force multiply this information now.
[02:28:17.009 --> 02:28:18.850]  I want to commend those that have.
[02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:22.432]  I want to encourage you to continue to air them on AXS TV and make copies.
[02:28:22.852 --> 02:28:24.413]  But I'm talking to you out there.
[02:28:24.573 --> 02:28:27.575]  If you haven't taken action, you really need to.
[02:28:28.275 --> 02:28:29.996]  I'm begging you to get involved in this fight.
[02:28:30.336 --> 02:28:36.619]  And I've found no better tool than God knocking you off your horse like Saul of Tarsus.
[02:28:37.079 --> 02:28:41.221]  Other than that, I've found God opening your eyes.
[02:28:41.501 --> 02:28:42.382]  That's the number one way.
[02:28:43.977 --> 02:28:48.619]  I've found no other tool as powerful as my videos to wake people up.
[02:28:48.639 --> 02:28:50.740]  We're having 90% conversion rates.
[02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:55.181]  90% of those that see the films are waking up, so call toll free to get them.
[02:28:55.201 --> 02:29:01.784]  1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or net or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:17.763]  Take action, get the films today, and get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:29:19.284 --> 02:29:23.587]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Ron in New York, and some more calls, and I'll jump straight into the news.
[02:29:23.627 --> 02:29:25.148]  Go ahead, Ron, I'm going to talk to you.
[02:29:25.208 --> 02:29:26.129]  Or, Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:29:26.449 --> 02:29:27.950]  Got another Ron in New York, too.
[02:29:28.151 --> 02:29:28.811]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:29:29.792 --> 02:29:30.132]  You there?
[02:29:30.773 --> 02:29:31.473]  Uh, yes, I'm here.
[02:29:31.993 --> 02:29:32.314]  Okay, good.
[02:29:32.334 --> 02:29:34.475]  I was on my cell phone, didn't know whether you could hear me or not.
[02:29:34.835 --> 02:29:42.161]  I've got a editorial here from the Daily Oklahoman about opposing the Patriot Act, but my thought is, one reason
[02:29:43.064 --> 02:29:45.565]  The city doesn't want to go along with this.
[02:29:45.625 --> 02:29:50.427]  They don't want to rock the boat for federal money and tourist dollars.
[02:29:50.927 --> 02:29:58.289]  They've got the bombing memorial here now, and they're trying to build a tourist economy on the bombing memorial.
[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:06.532]  And then they've got the Center for Terrorism here, which brings in federal money every year and Tinker Air Force Base.
[02:30:07.373 --> 02:30:08.033]  But let me hit this.
[02:30:09.278 --> 02:30:11.919]  Editorial, short editorial from the Daily Oklahoma real quick.
[02:30:11.939 --> 02:30:32.688]  Well let me just tell folks that don't know, they proposed a city law to reaffirm the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the city council voted down the one member and said we don't have a constitution here and that's a federal matter so a simple resolution saying we support liberty and freedom what our veterans fought and died for
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:36.742]  The City Council said, well, we don't care about the veterans.
[02:30:36.782 --> 02:30:37.242]  Go ahead.
[02:30:37.803 --> 02:30:44.308]  Okay, well, we have a Republican mayor, Republican newspaper, and some Republican council members.
[02:30:44.408 --> 02:30:47.630]  But anyway, it says, opposing the Patriot Act.
[02:30:48.051 --> 02:30:56.157]  Understandably, the Oklahoma City Council has decided to decline to weigh in on the worth of the so-called Patriot Act.
[02:30:56.718 --> 02:31:00.781]  It's a complex and controversial law, born out of the September 11, 2001 attack.
[02:31:02.796 --> 02:31:07.577]  But one that doesn't lend itself to lengthy debate in municipal government circles.
[02:31:08.438 --> 02:31:11.579]  Still, the issue is one worthy of the Court of Public Opinion.
[02:31:12.099 --> 02:31:22.182]  The Act, passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, goes to the heart of individual civil liberties in this country that generations of Americans have fought and died for.
[02:31:23.082 --> 02:31:28.884]  We've been generally supportive of Bush's war on terrorism, but have wondered if the Patriot Act goes too far
[02:31:29.659 --> 02:31:35.042]  By expanding governmental power to eavesdrop and give access to financial and computer records.
[02:31:35.903 --> 02:31:40.665]  We disagree with the recent move by some members of Congress who would like to make the law a permanent one.
[02:31:41.346 --> 02:31:50.911]  Lawmakers should be required to debate its extension or circumstances in waging such shadowy wars often change quickly.
[02:31:51.832 --> 02:31:57.315]  Maybe the proposal by City Councilman Brent Reinhart to force the city to oppose the Patriot Act
[02:31:58.061 --> 02:32:07.263]  While deferred indefinitely, will serve a wider purpose by calling attention to an issue that needs the public scrutiny and skepticism.
[02:32:08.124 --> 02:32:20.167]  Also, our local Channel 5 ABC affiliate conducted a viewer's poll the night the council voted on the resolution.
[02:32:21.087 --> 02:32:25.088]  At 6 o'clock, their poll was running 4-1 against the Patriot Act.
[02:32:27.347 --> 02:32:30.869]  Well, I would ask you, sir, to send me that information.
[02:32:31.049 --> 02:32:36.451]  I know that I've lobbied on Oklahoma City radio stations against the Patriot Act.
[02:32:36.551 --> 02:32:44.914]  I know conservatives are now learning what's in it, Ron, and I want to encourage you to keep up your work fighting the Patriot Act.
[02:32:45.094 --> 02:32:52.938]  And I'd like you to send me, you can get a tape of that or a news article about that, the poll running 4-1 against the Patriot Act.
[02:32:52.978 --> 02:32:54.018]  But even if it was running 100-1 for it,
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:33:01.785]  The Bill of Rights says that if it violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution, it is null and void.
[02:33:01.945 --> 02:33:08.131]  And to please send me that editorial or a hyperlink to it, I'd like to post it on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:08.632 --> 02:33:20.323]  For those that don't know, two states have passed laws reaffirming the Bill of Rights, decrying the Patriot Act as un-American and not stopping terrorism, and over 400 cities and towns have done the same.
[02:33:21.684 --> 02:33:22.844]  So they're in deep trouble.
[02:33:23.165 --> 02:33:27.066]  People are responding in defense of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:33:27.886 --> 02:33:43.832]  Ron, did you hear me yesterday and the day before read the Washington Times with the official brief of the Justice Department where they say the Patriot Act 2 is real and Patriot Act 1 will be used for all crime against all citizens.
[02:33:45.572 --> 02:33:46.533]  I missed that, Alex.
[02:33:46.633 --> 02:33:50.634]  I've been busy the last couple days, but I'm certainly not surprised at all.
[02:33:52.538 --> 02:33:53.758]  Well, I've got you here, Alex.
[02:33:53.938 --> 02:34:08.185]  I would like to ask your listeners to email the Daily Oklahoman and their CBS TV affiliate channel line at newsok.com and ask them to support the resolution against the Patriot Act.
[02:34:09.325 --> 02:34:15.588]  You must have many, many thousands of listeners, Alex, so maybe we can put their weight on our side.
[02:34:16.355 --> 02:34:16.876]  Absolutely.
[02:34:16.896 --> 02:34:18.217]  They should do it in every city.
[02:34:18.517 --> 02:34:19.898]  Every city that hasn't passed it.
[02:34:19.958 --> 02:34:20.839]  We proposed it.
[02:34:21.399 --> 02:34:24.842]  Two council members are for it in Austin, but they won't pass it.
[02:34:25.382 --> 02:34:27.003]  They don't support America either.
[02:34:27.063 --> 02:34:27.784]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:27.804 --> 02:34:32.267]  Before I go to Brandon and others and some more of this news, listen to this article.
[02:34:33.068 --> 02:34:35.530]  Ashcroft defends Patriot Act in visit.
[02:34:37.652 --> 02:34:43.476]  And Ashcroft went on to say that the Patriot Act didn't affect citizens, didn't take your rights.
[02:34:44.077 --> 02:34:45.698]  That was out of the Washington Times.
[02:34:46.559 --> 02:34:53.424]  But then, I have the other Washington Times article from Monday.
[02:34:53.624 --> 02:34:55.705]  Now, the one I just read was from last Friday.
[02:34:56.125 --> 02:34:57.026]  This is from Monday.
[02:34:57.066 --> 02:34:57.586]  Listen to this.
[02:34:57.667 --> 02:35:02.130]  Patriot Act on 2001, cast wide net, Frank J. Murray.
[02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:05.712]  Now, all he did was quote the Justice Department's own brief to Congress.
[02:35:05.772 --> 02:35:06.312]  It's public.
[02:35:07.253 --> 02:35:14.438]  Now, how did I know a year and a half ago that Patriot Act I affected citizens for all crimes, took juries,
[02:35:15.808 --> 02:35:25.874]  Got rid of your right to face your accusers, secret arrest, but you notice that Daily Oklahoma article and every other article I've seen says, oh, more surveillance, more powers to stop terrorists.
[02:35:27.095 --> 02:35:33.859]  They never mention it's about the FBI, local police breaking in your house without a warrant, taking whatever they want, planning whatever they want.
[02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:36.791]  They never mention any of that.
[02:35:37.371 --> 02:35:46.535]  They never mention that Section 802 says the new definition of terrorism is any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[02:35:47.335 --> 02:35:51.677]  Well now the new Patriot Act says that Section 802 isn't broad enough.
[02:35:51.977 --> 02:35:57.319]  They want an unlimited definition to secretly arrest you and secretly execute you.
[02:35:57.359 --> 02:36:03.282]  It actually says it if you do not even knowingly commit a crime or even if you don't commit a crime.
[02:36:04.659 --> 02:36:06.981]  Now let me tell you, that's worse than the Soviet Union.
[02:36:08.062 --> 02:36:12.065]  So go ahead globalists, keep lying, keep spinning, you're not going to get away with it.
[02:36:13.867 --> 02:36:31.961]  So this is out of the Washington Times, Patriot Act of 2001 casts wide net, long sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terror provisions of the USA Patriot Act have applied in non-terror investigations, just as battle lines are being drawn on proposed new powers in Patriot Act 2.
[02:36:33.021 --> 02:36:45.930]  Overall, the policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals, even when obtained under extraordinary anti-terrorism powers and information sharing between intelligence agencies and the FBI.
[02:36:46.011 --> 02:36:48.172]  So, what does that paragraph say?
[02:36:48.692 --> 02:36:54.617]  The policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals.
[02:36:55.433 --> 02:37:01.396]  Even when the information is obtained from the CIA domestically and given to the FBI.
[02:37:01.416 --> 02:37:02.737]  The CIA domestically.
[02:37:03.037 --> 02:37:03.618]  They've announced.
[02:37:03.718 --> 02:37:05.119]  They're now operating domestically.
[02:37:05.339 --> 02:37:08.781]  Well they've been operating for decades with the smack and the coke!
[02:37:10.642 --> 02:37:12.543]  And now these criminals are going to be on our streets.
[02:37:14.004 --> 02:37:15.905]  Now this is the Justice Department's quote here.
[02:37:16.385 --> 02:37:21.788]  We would use whatever tools are available to us within reason to prosecute violators of any law.
[02:37:22.907 --> 02:37:28.189]  We would use whatever tools are available to us to prosecute violators of any law.
[02:37:28.889 --> 02:37:38.872]  Justice Department spokesman Brian Sierra said in the wake of his department's massive report to Congress describing how the USA Patriot Act is being implemented.
[02:37:41.953 --> 02:37:43.253]  Now we've had Frank Murray on.
[02:37:43.293 --> 02:37:44.774]  He's a great Congress watcher.
[02:37:45.194 --> 02:37:48.395]  Actually reports what he sees, what's on C-SPAN.
[02:37:50.672 --> 02:37:59.137]  But all the other articles last week were, oh Ashcroft assures you this is not for citizens, it's only for narrow terror investigations.
[02:37:59.257 --> 02:38:02.339]  But semantically, he's telling the truth.
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:07.882]  Because terror is now any misdemeanor crime.
[02:38:09.703 --> 02:38:10.184]  Anything.
[02:38:12.145 --> 02:38:16.567]  Now he did lie saying there isn't a Patriot Act II, there isn't a proposed second Patriot terror law.
[02:38:16.888 --> 02:38:18.649]  When it was already introduced in the Senate under F-22.
[02:38:20.852 --> 02:38:24.693]  Semantically, it's like Clinton saying, it depends on what the word is, is, is, is.
[02:38:24.933 --> 02:38:27.813]  I mean, aren't you tired of this?
[02:38:30.314 --> 02:38:32.254]  So, that's what they're doing.
[02:38:32.855 --> 02:38:33.455]  Brandon?
[02:38:35.015 --> 02:38:36.695]  In Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:37.576 --> 02:38:38.336]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:38:38.356 --> 02:38:49.558]  I'm actually a student at the University of Texas at Austin, and I listen to your show every now and then, and I'm really intrigued by a lot of things you say, but I was just curious, you know, as a student, what sort of sources can I look to to educate myself
[02:38:50.094 --> 02:38:54.655]  Because, you know, I listen to the politicians on the news, and we're just supposed to take everything they say.
[02:38:54.775 --> 02:38:57.176]  But then I listen to you, and I can't just, you know, take everything you say.
[02:38:57.196 --> 02:38:58.956]  I want to go ahead and educate myself.
[02:38:58.976 --> 02:39:02.437]  So I was just curious, like I said, if you could name any sources that have spooked myself.
[02:39:02.457 --> 02:39:10.659]  Well, when I say Section 802 is the new definition of terrorism, you go to thomas.loc.gov.
[02:39:10.699 --> 02:39:11.859]  That's the Library of Congress.
[02:39:12.939 --> 02:39:13.259]  Okay.
[02:39:13.299 --> 02:39:13.979]  You type in H.R.
[02:39:13.999 --> 02:39:14.660]  3162 or Patriot Act.
[02:39:16.974 --> 02:39:19.395]  And there'll be five versions of it.
[02:39:19.415 --> 02:39:23.396]  You click on the one that says enrolled and passed in the House and Senate.
[02:39:23.576 --> 02:39:24.957]  That'll be the one with the latest date.
[02:39:25.457 --> 02:39:26.077]  October 27, 2001.
[02:39:26.937 --> 02:39:32.419]  And then you go to section 802 and you read the new definition of domestic terrorism.
[02:39:33.239 --> 02:39:40.101]  When I say that Ashcroft says there's no Patriot Act 2, I have him on video saying that in Police State 3.
[02:39:41.162 --> 02:39:41.922]  On C-SPAN.
[02:39:42.102 --> 02:39:44.663]  Then I have him saying later there is a Patriot Act 2.
[02:39:46.262 --> 02:39:51.043]  I have the Justice Department's quote here, that yes, it'll be used against citizens for all crimes.
[02:39:51.103 --> 02:39:52.063]  No more Bill of Rights.
[02:39:52.523 --> 02:39:53.803]  That's the Washington Times.
[02:39:55.884 --> 02:40:06.186]  When I say that Oklahoma City is proposing a law to get rid of the Patriot Act, because I read it in their newspaper last week, they report the truth on most issues.
[02:40:06.306 --> 02:40:07.846]  It's the spin they put on it.
[02:40:08.266 --> 02:40:13.327]  We take the spin off of it because of our larger understanding of the geopolitical spectrum.
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:17.321]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:40:17.921 --> 02:40:20.543]  Yeah.
[02:40:20.563 --> 02:40:32.632]  So when Bush says we've got a new law to make your pension funds safe, I go to the proposed changes and it says that you will no longer own your pension funds and they can take them from you.
[02:40:34.373 --> 02:40:36.915]  And so I come on the air and say, well this takes your pension funds.
[02:40:37.435 --> 02:40:44.120]  When a federal court rules that veterans above 65 no longer get health care,
[02:40:45.260 --> 02:41:04.734]  Uh, and uh, I go to the AP that tends to tell the truth, it's unfiltered, and I read the actual AP article where it says veterans won't get any more health care, and then I see it in the Austin American-Statesman a week later with a local spin saying, oh, there's been some changes that might make it a little tougher to get health care, but oh, this had to happen.
[02:41:05.255 --> 02:41:05.495]  Yeah.
[02:41:05.995 --> 02:41:07.977]  Okay, so when I read the statesman and it says,
[02:41:08.729 --> 02:41:14.131]  Perry signed a new bill, wherever you take Medicare or Medicaid, they'll take your house, but he says it's good.
[02:41:14.571 --> 02:41:22.193]  I go to the Texas Legislature's website, I read the bill, and it basically says you won't have any private property ownership if you ever take a government handout.
[02:41:23.073 --> 02:41:23.333]  See?
[02:41:23.893 --> 02:41:24.814]  That's what we do here.
[02:41:25.114 --> 02:41:26.174]  Does that answer your question?
[02:41:26.534 --> 02:41:27.034]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:27.594 --> 02:41:30.335]  I suggest InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for you.
[02:41:31.435 --> 02:41:32.996]  We'll be right back with more calls, more news.
[02:41:34.534 --> 02:41:38.880]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:43.506]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:43.647 --> 02:41:48.053]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:41:48.133 --> 02:41:49.415]  A New World Order?
[02:41:51.181 --> 02:41:55.404]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:55.464 --> 02:42:02.409]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:02.530 --> 02:42:04.611]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:04.931 --> 02:42:15.339]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:15.539 --> 02:42:16.060]  If you want to
[02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:20.902]  If you don't understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Take 3, is for you!
[02:42:21.403 --> 02:42:24.024]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:42:24.044 --> 02:42:25.185]  They're called toll free, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:25.225 --> 02:42:25.405]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:25.425 --> 02:42:26.445]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:42:35.333 --> 02:42:39.816]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:42:40.176 --> 02:42:44.278]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:42:44.558 --> 02:42:45.119]  We listened.
[02:42:45.419 --> 02:42:50.402]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:42:50.682 --> 02:42:51.162]  We listened.
[02:42:51.543 --> 02:42:54.584]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:42:55.025 --> 02:42:55.545]  We listened.
[02:42:55.985 --> 02:43:00.069]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:43:00.449 --> 02:43:00.930]  We listened.
[02:43:01.290 --> 02:43:06.514]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:43:06.935 --> 02:43:08.296]  Again, we listened.
[02:43:08.656 --> 02:43:16.043]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:43:16.423 --> 02:43:20.747]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[02:43:25.899 --> 02:43:26.903]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:26.923 --> 02:43:28.488]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:43:33.655 --> 02:43:34.696]  Hi, this is Jory Schreiling.
[02:43:34.756 --> 02:43:37.717]  As a nurse, I know the dangers of toxins and heavy metals in the body.
[02:43:38.058 --> 02:43:43.221]  Chelation treatments can rid the body of these toxins, but it can be expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient.
[02:43:43.361 --> 02:43:45.342]  But now, there's Detoxamin.
[02:43:45.762 --> 02:43:54.587]  Dr. Bruce Halsted, the grandfather of EDTA chelation therapy, says that Detoxamin is the only chelation suppository product on the market that has all the following attributes.
[02:43:54.927 --> 02:44:01.071]  It's legal, safe, comfortable to use, and has documented proof of its consistent effectiveness in its ability to chelate.
[02:44:01.611 --> 02:44:08.437]  Ten chelation treatments would cost about a thousand dollars, but you can get approximately the same amount of chelation therapy for $289.95.
[02:44:09.297 --> 02:44:14.581]  This is an amazing breakthrough, and now you can rid your body of heavy metals and toxins in the privacy of your own home.
[02:44:14.962 --> 02:44:21.327]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerHour.com to order your detoximent today.
[02:44:21.627 --> 02:44:24.029]  Imagine the equivalent of ten chelation treatments
[02:44:24.729 --> 02:44:25.590]  We're only $2.89.95.
[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:33.493]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerHour.com and detoxify with Detoxamine.
[02:44:35.934 --> 02:44:41.076]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:41.757 --> 02:44:44.118]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:45.358 --> 02:44:48.420]  That's right, we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:51.921]  We're about to go to Hankin, Texas and others and a few final news stories.
[02:44:52.962 --> 02:44:53.282]  But to
[02:44:54.816 --> 02:44:58.819]  Answer the UT college students' important question.
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:02.542]  Don't believe anything I say, sir.
[02:45:02.662 --> 02:45:03.723]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:45:04.363 --> 02:45:08.086]  I mean, they told us campaign finance reform would stop dirty money in politics.
[02:45:08.106 --> 02:45:12.790]  Well, it doubled the soft contributions that corporations can give.
[02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:14.551]  That is the corrupting influence.
[02:45:15.251 --> 02:45:19.595]  While it restricted First Amendment activities of groups in elections.
[02:45:19.695 --> 02:45:21.276]  And who I can interview, by the way.
[02:45:22.876 --> 02:45:24.316]  And so you can make up your own mind.
[02:45:24.376 --> 02:45:25.317]  Is that a good reform?
[02:45:25.557 --> 02:45:26.677]  Is that what they said it would do?
[02:45:27.177 --> 02:45:30.138]  Two years ago they passed a medical privacy bill.
[02:45:31.538 --> 02:45:32.179]  I read the bill.
[02:45:32.799 --> 02:45:34.319]  Made all your medical records public.
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:42.162]  Federalized all your different medical clinics where the feds have got computerized systems now and watch everything you do.
[02:45:42.182 --> 02:45:45.983]  I mean that's what they do across the board.
[02:45:46.023 --> 02:45:50.724]  I mean they said there wasn't a tips program to have you title on your neighbors and have the cable guy title on you.
[02:45:51.713 --> 02:45:53.393]  They changed the name, doubled the funding.
[02:45:55.134 --> 02:45:56.014]  This is what they do.
[02:45:58.214 --> 02:46:01.635]  So this is the information we're covering here on this broadcast.
[02:46:02.956 --> 02:46:07.136]  We look at the corruption of governments in the past, how they run scams, and we look at what's happening today.
[02:46:07.156 --> 02:46:14.438]  I mean, take a story like a trillion bucks, it's 1.2 trillion actually, missing from the Pentagon over the last eight years.
[02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:18.159]  There's no investigation, there's been a handful of news articles about
[02:46:18.931 --> 02:46:22.492]  The Defense Department admitting over a trillion's missing, we go read those articles.
[02:46:22.552 --> 02:46:23.773]  Why isn't it top story?
[02:46:24.553 --> 02:46:35.257]  Why isn't it top story that it's now admitted that those so-called bio-weapons trucks, trailers in Iraq, were for pumping up dirigibles, blimps, and the government knew that!
[02:46:36.437 --> 02:46:39.338]  They have the purchase order from the Russians in the 80's.
[02:46:39.938 --> 02:46:41.699]  They claim they were bio-weapons labs.
[02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:48.653]  Let's go ahead and talk to Hank in Texas is up next.
[02:46:48.693 --> 02:46:49.333]  Go ahead, Hank.
[02:46:50.014 --> 02:46:50.914]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:46:51.114 --> 02:46:51.835]  How you doing, sir?
[02:46:51.975 --> 02:46:52.235]  Good.
[02:46:53.475 --> 02:46:59.879]  I just wanted to let you know that apparently the police state is living well in San Antonio.
[02:47:01.984 --> 02:47:05.626]  I just noticed one of their new secret police cars today.
[02:47:05.826 --> 02:47:07.747]  You can hardly tell it's a police car.
[02:47:07.807 --> 02:47:11.709]  It's dark green with black lettering on the side.
[02:47:11.769 --> 02:47:17.812]  You have to be just about parallel or right next to the car to be able to see the San Antonio police.
[02:47:18.212 --> 02:47:24.596]  No antennas that are visible and they're cruising the highways.
[02:47:24.996 --> 02:47:26.657]  I wonder what that's about.
[02:47:28.878 --> 02:47:30.019]  Well, look.
[02:47:30.936 --> 02:47:32.717]  You build a prison society.
[02:47:32.817 --> 02:47:36.077]  Prisons are the biggest part of our economy and the fastest growing.
[02:47:37.018 --> 02:47:38.638]  And they need people in those prisons.
[02:47:39.578 --> 02:47:41.379]  They need to expand their industry.
[02:47:42.419 --> 02:47:46.180]  And it's going to get bigger and bigger, and they're going to go after more and more of us that are innocent.
[02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:51.161]  And the cops are running the drugs, the prostitutes, everything.
[02:47:51.201 --> 02:47:52.822]  They get caught all the time framing people.
[02:47:53.262 --> 02:47:57.143]  A lot of the cops aren't bad, but they're compartmentalized and don't stand up against the corruption.
[02:47:58.107 --> 02:48:01.590]  And it's system-wide.
[02:48:02.110 --> 02:48:04.492]  It's all part of the larger takeover.
[02:48:04.732 --> 02:48:06.434]  Can't find enough real criminals.
[02:48:06.494 --> 02:48:08.936]  Now they have to sneak up on anybody they can, I guess.
[02:48:09.736 --> 02:48:11.878]  And trump up some charge.
[02:48:12.018 --> 02:48:12.879]  Well, look at New York.
[02:48:12.919 --> 02:48:13.859]  The police are complaining.
[02:48:13.899 --> 02:48:17.022]  They said they've been ordered to put as many people as they can in jail.
[02:48:17.382 --> 02:48:19.544]  Pregnant women sit down on the sidewalk sick.
[02:48:20.716 --> 02:48:24.298]  Well, anyway, maybe there's some people listening that will be on the lookout.
[02:48:24.318 --> 02:48:24.578]  Thank you.
[02:48:46.367 --> 02:48:49.690]  Oh man, there's a lot of news we got to, some we didn't have a chance to get to.
[02:48:49.790 --> 02:48:57.135]  I hope you will tell your friends and family about the show, the great guests we have, the great callers, the important news we cover by analysis as well.
[02:48:57.995 --> 02:49:00.237]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[02:49:01.458 --> 02:49:03.779]  Infowars.com is another great site we have.
[02:49:03.799 --> 02:49:05.080]  Visit them both daily.
[02:49:05.581 --> 02:49:08.883]  Please email your friends and family and tell them to check them out today.
[02:49:08.903 --> 02:49:14.527]  And tell your friends and family to tune in, whether it's on AM, FM, shortwave, internet, or satellite.
[02:49:15.529 --> 02:49:17.050]  Through this worldwide broadcast.
[02:49:17.530 --> 02:49:20.492]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, and back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:49:20.992 --> 02:49:21.993]  There in the day central.
[02:49:22.733 --> 02:49:23.614]  God bless you all.
[02:49:26.416 --> 02:49:30.058]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:49:30.198 --> 02:49:34.601]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:49:34.801 --> 02:49:35.301]  The Aeronizer.
