[00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.274]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:59.848]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!

[00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.493]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:18.116]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:22.639]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:24.020]  The New World Order.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.740]  Panama.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.022]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:37.024]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:37.144 --> 00:06:39.205]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:49.949]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.592]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:16.836]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:07:17.076 --> 00:07:21.439]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:30.645]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:07:34.748 --> 00:07:39.796]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:46.846]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:25.783]  This sacred ground
[00:08:52.438 --> 00:09:21.891]  deserves my all no less for God where freedom's called and if my life be laid down let it be on sacred ground it was purchased
[00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:33.649]  With the blood of patriots Consecrated for liberty Protected through the generations Now the future rests with me This sacred ground
[00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:59.143]  It deserves my all, no less for God, for freedom's call.
[00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:10.412]  And if my life be laid down, let it be on sacred ground.
[00:10:18.903 --> 00:10:24.388]  Who will answer the cry for warriors?
[00:10:24.468 --> 00:10:29.813]  Who will be there to battle I?
[00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:34.317]  Who will lift up a prayer for courage?
[00:10:34.357 --> 00:10:37.039]  Who will bury me if I die?
[00:10:45.447 --> 00:10:51.072]  This sacred ground deserves my all.
[00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:57.357]  No less for God, for freedom's cause.
[00:10:59.438 --> 00:11:11.548]  And if my life be laid down, let it be on sacred ground.
[00:11:19.058 --> 00:11:20.519]  We're good to go.
[00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:55.603]  No less spoke not of freedom's call.
[00:11:55.623 --> 00:12:09.627]  And if my life be laid down, let it be on sacred ground.
[00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:13.668]  And if my life
[00:12:16.088 --> 00:12:24.455]  It's in London when Hitler launched his Blitzkrieg
[00:12:44.802 --> 00:12:47.547]  So, you can really see what they're setting up.
[00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.070]  Order out of chaos.
[00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:51.935]  World War I, they try to give you a League of Nations.
[00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:53.458]  World War II, they give you a UN.
[00:12:54.719 --> 00:13:01.264]  Then they say in the globalist policy papers that they were going to use terror to unify us behind a world empire.
[00:13:01.644 --> 00:13:22.158]  They needed, quote, Pearl Harbor-size attacks or larger to get the American people behind, quote, the New World Order, as Brzezinski and Hart and Rudman and Wolfowitz and Pearl and Jeb Bush have all said in their own public policy reports before 9-1-1.
[00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:22.698]  So this is a
[00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:25.910]  This is a horrible thing that's happening.
[00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.092]  World War III is being set up.
[00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:37.179]  And to get you behind the war, the military-industrial complex has already implemented almost all of the Northwoods U.S.
[00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:39.301]  government terror plan, where the U.S.
[00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:51.290]  government officially called for carrying out terror in the continental United States, hijacking jets, bombing D.C., all these horrible things to get us behind this war.
[00:13:51.989 --> 00:13:54.191]  And it's going to kill a lot of innocent Americans.
[00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:56.753]  It is going to destroy our liberties.
[00:13:56.873 --> 00:14:03.158]  It is going to set up more of a dictatorship through this giant federal government and FEMA and the whole nine yards.
[00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:08.262]  So I'll get into some of that news in a minute, but I'm going to go ahead and talk about this on air.
[00:14:08.302 --> 00:14:17.209]  I'm going to talk about it once because I told one or two people this weekend and already it was metastasizing into rumors.
[00:14:18.409 --> 00:14:21.452]  I was out with a friend on their boat this weekend
[00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:28.514]  On the Lake Travis and on Saturday, Saturday night, we were out there fishing.
[00:14:29.374 --> 00:14:34.797]  We were going back to the dock and we came across a pontoon boat that was dead in the water.
[00:14:34.998 --> 00:14:36.639]  And there were about four foot waves.
[00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:41.001]  There had been some storms earlier in the day and we couldn't tie up alongside of it.
[00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:42.662]  The pontoon was in the middle of the lake.
[00:14:44.443 --> 00:14:48.946]  And I jumped in to swim over and try to fix their boat.
[00:14:49.386 --> 00:14:50.947]  No good deed goes unpunished.
[00:14:51.764 --> 00:14:54.585]  And I, of course, the boat was turned off, it was dead in the water.
[00:14:55.025 --> 00:15:00.428]  I started climbing up on the side of the pontoon boat that has aluminum siding on it, and I slipped.
[00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:08.431]  Once I got up on the boat, I slipped, and my hand caught in between the railing, and it basically cut my finger off.
[00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:14.834]  So, I've had a really enjoyable weekend, and it feels real good, because I'm not about to take painkillers, and that'd impair my judgment.
[00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:21.099]  And so, as I sit here now, they did a good job basically reattaching my finger.
[00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:33.782]  The best description of it, you ever seen Terminator 2 where Schwarzenegger, you know, the robot, the android, and he cuts his flesh off and pulls the flesh off his arm and there's the skeleton under it?
[00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:34.862]  Well, that's basically what happened.
[00:15:34.882 --> 00:15:38.663]  It just peeled the skin off my finger down to the end, down to the bone.
[00:15:38.683 --> 00:15:40.003]  It was just a bone.
[00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:43.884]  It was like taking a chicken leg and pulling the meat off of it from top to bottom.
[00:15:44.562 --> 00:15:46.564]  But, uh, they did a great job putting it all back on.
[00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:47.185]  I'm moving it.
[00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:50.168]  Other than some throbbing pain, it's, uh, good.
[00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:53.031]  Other than, you know, seeping and continual bleeding.
[00:15:53.051 --> 00:15:56.735]  But, uh, I just want to thank God that it didn't cut my finger off.
[00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.718]  Because it did put large indentions in the bone.
[00:15:59.738 --> 00:16:06.706]  I want to thank God that, uh, didn't cut my finger completely off of the bone itself.
[00:16:07.686 --> 00:16:08.666]  And that's good.
[00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:10.507]  But you know how these rumors end.
[00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:22.150]  By the time people are done hearing about it, it'll be that I was run over by a boat and cut in half, and then flying saucers lifted me back out of the water, and you know, there were 14 hobgoblins jumping around.
[00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.951]  That's the way stories work.
[00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.952]  You know, a patriot can go on vacation for a week and come back and hear that they've been assassinated.
[00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:57.226]  And I guess in a way that's a good thing because people are all watchful for folks that are in the movement of real news and information but uh... yes I decided to go out and do some fishing with a friend and then I did my good deed and jumped off the boat to swim over and help these people and uh... almost cut my finger off so that was a lot of fun uh... Saturday but it could be worse you know life is short this shows us how
[00:16:58.539 --> 00:17:07.004]  People are worried and scared of fighting the New World Order, scared of getting involved, scared of telling the truth, scared of what their neighbors will think of them if they say the government's corrupt.
[00:17:07.104 --> 00:17:08.165]  Ooh, what a surprise.
[00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:14.148]  Oh, what an incredible original idea that governments might do something wrong and might need to be watched.
[00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:16.049]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:27.976]  But they will get fearlessly in their cars, in boats, they will water ski, they will snow ski, they will ride bikes down the side of the highway,
[00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.283]  Incredibly dangerous things.
[00:17:31.964 --> 00:17:34.786]  We do this every day because it's accepted by the society.
[00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:36.067]  Everybody does it.
[00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:41.871]  But then they'll be afraid to stand up against corruption or afraid to get involved in the fight for liberty.
[00:17:42.391 --> 00:17:44.633]  I mean, you could be diagnosed with cancer tomorrow.
[00:17:45.193 --> 00:17:50.597]  You could have a heart attack walking into your house or going into work.
[00:17:52.158 --> 00:17:52.819]  You could die.
[00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:54.760]  You could be struck by lightning playing golf.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.921]  It happens all the time.
[00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:56.662]  You could drown.
[00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.831]  So life is short, folks.
[00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:01.171]  You're not here very long.
[00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:09.014]  And, you know, I could have caught my arm in that thing and slipped my wrist, gone into shock, and gone to the bottom of the lake.
[00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:12.535]  Out there in those big waves.
[00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:13.816]  But I didn't.
[00:18:15.176 --> 00:18:21.099]  And I just calmly, with the skin flopping around on the end of my finger, swam back over, got in my boat.
[00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:22.959]  I'm usually pretty calm under pressure.
[00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:24.740]  Again, thanks to the good Lord.
[00:18:26.343 --> 00:18:32.445]  And we drove back in, 10 minutes back into the dock, and then that was fine.
[00:18:32.465 --> 00:18:34.606]  There was a big party going on at the dock.
[00:18:35.206 --> 00:18:38.387]  You know, they have like a big restaurant and bands out there at night.
[00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:44.428]  And I come pulling in, there's a no-wake zone like a half mile out from the harbor.
[00:18:45.649 --> 00:18:56.032]  And we come driving in, and my friend Kevin was driving about, I don't know, 15 miles an hour in the no-wake zone, which it wasn't throwing much of a wake.
[00:18:56.866 --> 00:19:07.832]  We had all these people mad at us yelling, and they all ran up to the dock as we pulled up, and there was blood all over the place, and they were all yelling and cussing at me, drunk I guess, and I just held my hand up and said, hey!
[00:19:08.813 --> 00:19:25.682]  Almost cut my finger off, and they all felt pretty stupid, but you know, they got the buoys out front, you're not supposed to speed into the harbor, but I was in no mood, and I rarely slip up, but I did, I apologized to those, I had some choice words for them,
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.040]  I'm just glad I got my finger.
[00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:33.762]  My whole family's glad I didn't cut a finger off.
[00:19:34.562 --> 00:19:37.064]  That's enough about me whining about my finger.
[00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:40.252]  Now we're going to get a bunch of calls, oh I'm sorry about your finger.
[00:19:40.692 --> 00:19:44.153]  People are going to hear that and then it's going to translate into I cut my arm off.
[00:19:44.193 --> 00:19:45.974]  So please don't call about it.
[00:19:45.994 --> 00:19:47.675]  No condolences needed.
[00:19:47.695 --> 00:19:57.258]  It's just a funny story and people locally found out about it and before it turned into an urban legend that I got cut in half or something, I wanted to neutralize that.
[00:19:57.819 --> 00:19:58.919]  Or I wouldn't have talked about it.
[00:20:00.447 --> 00:20:01.789]  Alright, we'll come back and get in the news.
[00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:04.692]  We've got three big guests coming up today and a lot of key information.

[00:20:58.631 --> 00:20:58.671]  800-419-2335.
[00:20:58.691 --> 00:20:58.731]  800-419-2335.
[00:20:58.751 --> 00:20:58.791]  800-419-2335.
[00:21:08.318 --> 00:21:08.398]  419-2335.
[00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:16.227]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:20.611]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:21.472]  We listened.
[00:21:21.773 --> 00:21:26.778]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:27.018 --> 00:21:27.519]  We listened.
[00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:30.920]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.880]  We listened.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.422]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:36.802 --> 00:21:37.282]  We listened.
[00:21:37.622 --> 00:21:42.864]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:43.264 --> 00:21:44.664]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:45.004 --> 00:21:52.366]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:55.807]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259
[00:21:57.568 --> 00:21:59.009]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:59.049 --> 00:21:59.609]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:59.629 --> 00:22:01.330]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.211]  Hi, Jack Browner with Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.231 --> 00:22:04.551]  The real money folks.
[00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:05.892]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:07.353]  The Nasdaq was down 22% for the year?
[00:22:07.393 --> 00:22:08.913]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[00:22:08.973 --> 00:22:10.414]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:29.100]  Unfortunately for many of us, the paper markets have already wiped out life savings with no hope of recovery.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.581]  Don't let this happen to you.
[00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:33.162]  Call Midas Resources today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:35.303 --> 00:22:37.224]  Gold Spot at that time was trading at about $275.
[00:22:37.484 --> 00:22:41.145]  It is now up dramatically and looking very bullish.
[00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:46.247]  We recommend it at that time to put a significant portion of your assets into the gold and silver collector coins.
[00:22:46.527 --> 00:22:47.888]  That advice still stands.
[00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:52.090]  Call Midas today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.731]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[00:22:55.011 --> 00:22:57.632]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[00:22:57.972 --> 00:23:02.894]  The time to move to hard assets is now, before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[00:23:03.154 --> 00:23:04.494]  Protect your financial holdings.
[00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:06.275]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.565 --> 00:23:12.666]  Remember what it was like to get up in the morning without pain and stiffness in your joints?

[00:23:57.318 --> 00:23:57.818]  Call 1-800-643-9558 today.
[00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.181]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:38.821]  Alex Jones here.
[00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:42.602]  It is Friday, the 20th of June, 2003.
[00:24:43.342 --> 00:24:53.344]  The first 20 minutes of the show you heard music and rebroadcast because I'm down here in Texas and the great folks that run the show are in Minnesota and we were trying to get connected.
[00:24:53.364 --> 00:24:54.685]  That happens a couple times a year.
[00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:56.065]  It's all on my end, of course.
[00:24:57.271 --> 00:25:07.758]  There is a lot of information to cover today, just so much of it, and I really have been kicking myself because I haven't been getting to all the news here on the show.
[00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:12.021]  I've been having a lot of great guests on, but I have not been covering all the news.
[00:25:13.802 --> 00:25:16.203]  Like what Ritalin's doing to our children.
[00:25:16.224 --> 00:25:18.445]  We've covered this for years, but now it's admitted.
[00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:22.988]  Causing heart attacks, brain damage, retardation of growth.
[00:25:23.743 --> 00:25:24.363]  Violence.
[00:25:24.703 --> 00:25:25.984]  Same thing with Paxil.
[00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.565]  Every time there's a mass shooter.
[00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:30.866]  Every time kids beat some other kid to death with axes.
[00:25:31.606 --> 00:25:34.648]  Every time we investigate it, a mother drowns her kids.
[00:25:34.988 --> 00:25:37.509]  Someone goes psychotic in a delusional rage.
[00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:44.211]  They're always on Paxil and Prozac and the other psychotropics.
[00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:46.873]  Or they're on one of the amphetamines like Ritalin.
[00:25:48.553 --> 00:25:50.954]  And now this is coming out and they can't cover it up.
[00:25:50.994 --> 00:25:51.775]  They can't hide it.
[00:25:51.835 --> 00:25:52.695]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:54.306 --> 00:25:55.587]  We've had a major victory.
[00:25:55.687 --> 00:26:09.998]  John, gun grabber, anti-christian, pro-New World Order, wolf in sheep's clothing, John Ashcroft has said that, well, there isn't a Patriot Act II, there is a Patriot Act II.
[00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:12.040]  Okay, it does affect citizens' rights.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.565]  The Justice Department has said they will go after citizens for all misdemeanors, any reason, no more rights.
[00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:23.289]  But now, he has gone before the media yesterday
[00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.031]  Now this is out of the New York Times.
[00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:32.453]  Ashcroft calls on news media to help explain anti-terrorism laws.
[00:26:32.493 --> 00:26:34.934]  You mean to continue your lies.
[00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:36.235]  You are a liar!
[00:26:37.115 --> 00:26:39.416]  You are an un-American liar!
[00:26:39.697 --> 00:26:41.037]  You are a traitor!
[00:26:41.157 --> 00:26:42.898]  You are seditious!
[00:26:44.018 --> 00:26:51.862]  You are attacking the Bill of Rights and what does the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and Constitution say about that, Mr. Gun Grabber?
[00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:59.589]  So Ashcroft calls on news media to help explain anti-terrorism laws.
[00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:08.054]  And he met with the media yesterday, with the heads of the major newspapers and television broadcast systems and internet and radio.
[00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:14.378]  He told them, we want you to go tell the people to back off, we're not taking their rights.
[00:27:15.126 --> 00:27:16.186]  You're a liar!
[00:27:16.326 --> 00:27:17.787]  People are reading the bill.
[00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:20.948]  They have caught you in your lies, Ashcroft.
[00:27:21.428 --> 00:27:24.869]  And I know you're panicking because 400 cities have said no to you.
[00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.850]  Two states, Alaska and Hawaii.
[00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:33.232]  And so we'll recap, yet again, the lies of John Ashcroft.
[00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:35.273]  Because they are on the offensive now.
[00:27:35.793 --> 00:27:37.934]  The best defense is a good offense.
[00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:40.809]  Because we're having victories.
[00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:46.011]  Now, I told you the globalists can easily carry out terror and say, see, we told you so.
[00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:51.233]  This was to keep you all safe and you didn't give your rights up so the terrorists got you again.
[00:27:52.273 --> 00:27:54.934]  And I'm sure they're going to pull that very, very soon.
[00:27:55.014 --> 00:27:56.455]  They carried out 9-1-1.
[00:27:56.815 --> 00:27:58.055]  They carried out Oklahoma City.
[00:27:58.095 --> 00:27:59.736]  They carried out the First World Trade Center.
[00:28:00.936 --> 00:28:06.478]  They're carrying out most of the terror attacks from all the evidence we have and their own official government documents and plans.
[00:28:07.702 --> 00:28:30.966]  But, if we're able to expose that they're the terrorists, that they stand to gain from the terrorism, and then we're able to show how they leave the borders open and are doing nothing to protect the American people, and then we show how they're lying about what's in Patriot Act 1 and 2, then we can effectively defeat their program that they're using to enslave us.
[00:28:33.286 --> 00:28:36.987]  And Ashcroft is also grandstanding, claiming they stopped some plot to
[00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:47.709]  Cut these suspension cords at the Brooklyn Bridge, and they admit that a crew of 50 people, it would take them probably 12 hours to cut enough of the suspensions to even make the thing sag.
[00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.311]  You know, these are giant, huge cords.
[00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:54.773]  You could cut half of them and nothing would happen to the bridge.
[00:28:55.473 --> 00:28:58.614]  For a good welder, it'd take 20 minutes to cut through one of them.
[00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:02.336]  So, just more total theater.
[00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:04.337]  I mean, this is the government that told us that
[00:29:05.146 --> 00:29:08.729]  The Iraqis had bio-weapons labs, mobile bio-weapons labs.
[00:29:08.769 --> 00:29:23.720]  Turns out they knew from day one that it was trucks sold to them by the Russians and now we find out other trucks sold to them by the British to pump up a surveillance balloon, something all governments have, on their borders.
[00:29:24.101 --> 00:29:28.284]  And they had the purchase orders from the mid-80s during the Iran-Iraq war.
[00:29:29.238 --> 00:29:33.341]  And our government knew day one what those trucks were and said that it wasn't.
[00:29:33.722 --> 00:29:36.384]  And by the way, they say they'll torture terrorist suspects.
[00:29:36.744 --> 00:29:41.307]  You can't believe a word that comes out of anybody's mouth that's been in their custody.
[00:29:42.728 --> 00:29:49.133]  When they got their people going to work on them with the high-tech torture devices, which they say they're using, by the way.
[00:29:50.394 --> 00:29:52.196]  Alright, we'll come back and get into all this news.
[00:29:52.256 --> 00:29:53.677]  Believe me, it is voluminous.
[00:29:54.137 --> 00:29:56.459]  You don't want to miss this live Friday edition.
[00:29:56.939 --> 00:29:58.040]  And we're going to take your calls.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.001]  Please stay with me.
[00:30:00.473 --> 00:30:03.496]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.396 --> 00:30:07.158]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:14.665]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:30:14.825 --> 00:30:19.248]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:30:19.408 --> 00:30:20.970]  There is a chance, chance, 8-0-3-44-38.
[00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.391]  That's toll-free, triple-8, 8-0-3-44-38.
[00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:23.171]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:30:42.163 --> 00:30:55.368]  From Nazareth he came with the right tag band to bring a revolution.
[00:30:55.408 --> 00:31:01.110]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand him.
[00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:07.373]  The cost was a solution, but he rose again.
[00:31:09.353 --> 00:31:13.897]  Wise men follow him, they roam the roost again.
[00:31:15.398 --> 00:31:20.662]  Wise men follow him, thank God for the reggae game.
[00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:35.608]  When it comes to heroes and renegades of life
[00:31:52.768 --> 00:31:55.990]  They failed to get the crown.
[00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.892]  Another ragtag band.
[00:31:59.433 --> 00:32:06.118]  Declaring independence.
[00:32:06.178 --> 00:32:08.980]  They laid their bodies down.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.621]  On a bloody wall.
[00:32:11.482 --> 00:32:14.944]  At liberty for their descendants.
[00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:18.447]  Thanks to the renegades.
[00:32:20.342 --> 00:32:22.949]  Thanks to the Renegades.
[00:32:44.273 --> 00:32:47.537]  Oh Lord, Lord, where are we?
[00:32:47.617 --> 00:32:51.260]  What a case of heroes, renegades or pirates.
[00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:16.282]  Where are the Renegades?
[00:33:16.383 --> 00:33:22.507]  In the world today Who are the Renegades?
[00:33:24.048 --> 00:33:40.899]  In the world today Thank God for the Renegades And the lives they lead Far ahead of Their time Without the Renegades
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.321]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[00:33:45.841 --> 00:33:48.042]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[00:33:48.062 --> 00:33:50.643]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:33:50.663 --> 00:33:51.003]  Back live.
[00:33:51.023 --> 00:33:52.064]  It is Friday, the 20th of June, 2003.
[00:33:52.104 --> 00:33:53.364]  We'll be live until the next two hours.
[00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:07.607]  24 minutes.
[00:34:07.647 --> 00:34:09.328]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:34:09.368 --> 00:34:11.390]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:11.450]  800-259-9231.
[00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:12.991]  Let me jump into this.
[00:34:20.876 --> 00:34:37.024]  First off, and then we'll get into all the wildfires in Arizona, and the government gun-grabbing that's going on, and the globalists saying they will invade Iran, Syria, and North Korea, and the national draft, they've got ready for your children, and the police state, they're setting up.
[00:34:39.005 --> 00:34:45.448]  And I know I keep harping on this because the alternative media has a lot of power because we have active listeners.
[00:34:46.204 --> 00:34:49.025]  The people that seek out alternative information.
[00:34:49.065 --> 00:34:57.469]  The intelligent segment of the population that has read history and understands what's happening and who has read their Bill of Rights.
[00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:06.913]  And so we need to inform the people out there and to point you in the direction to look at the evidence for yourself.
[00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:10.915]  Go read Patriot Act 1 for yourself.
[00:35:11.594 --> 00:35:18.276]  Secret arrests for absolutely no reason, misdemeanors now punishable by execution.
[00:35:18.296 --> 00:35:33.000]  Ed Ashcroft tried to say that this didn't affect citizens for the last year and a half, then three months ago, two and a half, three months ago, before the House and Senate in two separate committees, and I have clips of him saying this in Police State 3.
[00:35:34.088 --> 00:35:37.031]  He said that you aid terrorists if you say we're taking your liberties.
[00:35:37.071 --> 00:35:38.752]  You're a liar if you say that.
[00:35:39.133 --> 00:35:40.894]  He said it doesn't affect citizens.
[00:35:40.914 --> 00:35:43.437]  There is no proposed Patriot Act 2.
[00:35:44.197 --> 00:35:50.243]  Saying this after it had been introduced in the Senate four months before he testified.
[00:35:51.124 --> 00:35:51.484]  Okay?
[00:35:51.844 --> 00:35:53.286]  He's testifying two months ago.
[00:35:53.306 --> 00:35:56.809]  It had been introduced January 6th in the Senate.
[00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.312]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:01.238 --> 00:36:11.134]  Well, last week the Justice Department was back testifying again, and they admitted, yes, there's a Patriot Act II, here it is, we're proposing it, we need this to keep you safe.
[00:36:12.646 --> 00:36:14.088]  And yes, it affects citizens.
[00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:19.473]  We will use it for all crime, all law enforcement, against everyone in the United States.
[00:36:19.573 --> 00:36:34.487]  And I've read the quotes by Brian Sierra, spokesman for the Justice Department, out of the Congressional record, and it was also reported on in the Washington Times in a story with the headline, Patriot Act of 2001 Cast Wide Net.
[00:36:37.865 --> 00:36:39.706]  So we're seeing a lot of doublespeak.
[00:36:40.026 --> 00:36:42.168]  Ashcroft says it doesn't take your liberty for years.
[00:36:42.188 --> 00:36:45.290]  A couple months ago he says there is no Patriot Act 2.
[00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.273]  Fifteen days ago, two Thursdays ago, he says there is a Patriot Act 2.
[00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.273]  It's for your safety.
[00:36:52.194 --> 00:36:56.416]  And then now he's back lying again after flip-flopping repeatedly.
[00:36:56.436 --> 00:36:58.938]  And this is a New York Times story.
[00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:01.561]  And I've got an AP story as well.
[00:37:01.641 --> 00:37:02.882]  I read something in the New York Times.
[00:37:02.962 --> 00:37:04.922]  I don't automatically believe it.
[00:37:04.962 --> 00:37:09.923]  I have to go to the source and get the text of his speech and go to the Associated Press.
[00:37:09.983 --> 00:37:11.103]  And yes, he did say this.
[00:37:11.783 --> 00:37:17.145]  Ashcroft calls on news media to help explain anti-terrorism laws.
[00:37:18.005 --> 00:37:20.965]  We're posting this on Infowars.com.
[00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:23.966]  So, he's going to them saying, help me lie.
[00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:39.831]  Attorney General John Ashcroft called on the press and television today to dispel fears about the sweeping anti-terrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act, which was enacted after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
[00:37:40.695 --> 00:37:59.030]  Addressing two dozen editors, publishers, television executives, and others, Mr. Ashcroft said, we need the help of the news industry, the fourth of state, to inform citizens about the constitutional tools and methods being used in the war against terror.
[00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:06.996]  Oh, secret arrest of citizens for any misdemeanor, charge, never to be seen again, execution chambers being built.
[00:38:07.978 --> 00:38:08.818]  And that's Reuters.
[00:38:09.059 --> 00:38:11.200]  So, that's your constitutional tool.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:18.183]  We need the media's help, for instance, in portraying accurately the USA Patriot Act.
[00:38:19.724 --> 00:38:27.528]  He told a conference of Journalism and Homeland Security, convened by the Aspen Institute, a non-partisan policy research group, that
[00:38:28.897 --> 00:38:39.282]  Complaints and misunderstanding about the act were so widespread that I heard a fellow say his car wouldn't start the other day and he blamed the Patriot Act.
[00:38:39.342 --> 00:38:45.705]  So, see now, grassy knoll, flying saucers, if you think it takes your rights.
[00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:55.770]  Well, we list the subsections that I think are the most draconian on Infowars.com in the Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2 subsections.
[00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:10.596]  And you go read the subsections for yourself, my analysis, and then you click at the bottom of the page and it takes you to the government's own website where you can download both the acts and read it for yourself.
[00:39:11.956 --> 00:39:20.440]  But Ashcroft knows that 99 plus percent of the American people will never read legislation.
[00:39:22.834 --> 00:39:24.795]  So, I am boiling mad about this.
[00:39:24.876 --> 00:39:41.847]  I mean, remember it was Ashcroft that said we're going to have the TIPS program where your cable guy, the telephone company, the carpet cleaners will be tattling on you for drugs, guns, and terror, and every other crime, and the Postal Service is going to spy on you.
[00:39:42.167 --> 00:39:48.932]  There's a huge backlash, and I have the articles where Ashcroft and Ridge said there was never a TIPS program.
[00:39:48.972 --> 00:39:50.213]  We never proposed it.
[00:39:51.423 --> 00:39:53.165]  There was never a tips program.
[00:39:53.565 --> 00:39:55.667]  We never proposed it.
[00:39:56.547 --> 00:39:58.289]  Now, you all heard them propose it.
[00:39:58.529 --> 00:39:59.930]  It was in all the newspapers.
[00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.433]  And when there was heat on the subject, they said there is no tips program.
[00:40:04.894 --> 00:40:08.417]  And by the way, they went ahead and gave it a new name and doubled the funding for it.
[00:40:08.477 --> 00:40:09.198]  So it is there.
[00:40:09.238 --> 00:40:09.918]  It was funded.
[00:40:10.219 --> 00:40:11.500]  Dick Armey did not defeat it.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.821]  More smoke and mirrors.
[00:40:14.222 --> 00:40:14.922]  I have Ridge.
[00:40:14.942 --> 00:40:16.764]  We've aired the clip off Fox News here.
[00:40:17.104 --> 00:40:19.026]  Governor Ridge, the head of Homeland Security.
[00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:36.252]  The Project Phoenix operative, up there saying, on national news, that we want to get rid of posse commentatus, the 1878 law, barring the military from engaging in search and seizures against the American people, we want troops on the streets.
[00:40:37.012 --> 00:40:45.718]  They proposed it, you heard them do it last year, and then when there was a backlash they said, we never proposed it, we're not getting rid of posse commentatus.
[00:40:47.958 --> 00:40:50.159]  They are congenital liars!
[00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:55.900]  They dwarf the criminal, Bill Clinton, in his line.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.200]  They dwarf him!
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.601]  He is nothing compared to them!
[00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:03.922]  I have never seen such wall-to-wall lying!
[00:41:06.823 --> 00:41:07.983]  So this is what they're doing.
[00:41:10.504 --> 00:41:15.045]  So now he has gone to the media and he has said, help me lie to the public.
[00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:24.649]  In fact, he said, over the past 20 months, the Patriot Act has become a critical reason for our success in the war against terrorists, stopping further attacks in the United States.
[00:41:24.669 --> 00:41:33.159]  In particular, Mr. Ashcroft sought the quiet concern of the government's access to library records and its use of so-called roving wiretaps on terrorism suspects.
[00:41:33.795 --> 00:41:37.018]  They always try to focus on surveillance and wiretaps.
[00:41:37.779 --> 00:41:43.124]  Ashcroft, Section 213 has already been used in thousands of drug cases, okay?
[00:41:43.605 --> 00:41:52.214]  Section 213 says, without a warrant, any federal agency can break in your house, plant whatever they want, take whatever they want.
[00:41:52.374 --> 00:41:53.174]  It says that.
[00:41:53.555 --> 00:41:55.657]  The sneak and peek provision, Section 213.
[00:41:57.285 --> 00:42:23.174]  Section 215, so they can demand all library, all bookseller records, and that if the librarian, or the Borders books, or Barnes and Noble's books, employee tells anyone they were there, they can be charged under the USA Patriot Act Anti-Terror Definition, and can be secretly arrested, secretly imprisoned, or secretly executed.
[00:42:23.494 --> 00:42:25.134]  Now, it says that!
[00:42:25.895 --> 00:42:26.375]  Okay?
[00:42:27.486 --> 00:42:31.569]  I challenge you, listeners, to go find out what liars these people are!
[00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.192]  I mean, I'm having trouble dealing with them now.
[00:42:37.333 --> 00:42:46.960]  Clinton saying, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, shaking his crooked finger at us, isn't even on the radar screen compared to these lies.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.821]  Bush Sr.
[00:42:48.901 --> 00:42:52.384]  saying, read my lips, no new taxes, that doesn't even
[00:42:53.252 --> 00:42:56.934]  even show up on the charts compared to the lying.
[00:42:56.994 --> 00:43:17.822]  The lying is so massive they will say one thing one day on national TV and say 180 a different statement the next day out of the same bureaucrat's mouth and the liberals don't call them on it, the conservatives don't call them on it because they're a bunch of neocon intellectual prostitutes.
[00:43:19.402 --> 00:43:21.063]  We are being bathed
[00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:26.482]  marinated in lies and neocon trash.
[00:43:28.924 --> 00:43:31.966]  So, my head is spinning after the lightest garbage.
[00:43:32.066 --> 00:43:35.148]  I mean, I just don't even know how to respond to this level of lying.
[00:43:35.208 --> 00:43:37.969]  It's just wall-to-wall lying.
[00:43:39.991 --> 00:43:41.732]  I mean, take what we found out.
[00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:49.757]  That they falsified a document, made it out of whole cloth, produced it, that Niger, the country of Niger, had sold
[00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:54.414]  Nuclear weapons parts to Iraq.
[00:43:54.454 --> 00:43:55.856]  Turned out they just made it up.
[00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:56.937]  Just produced it.
[00:43:57.297 --> 00:43:58.959]  That came out, no one was prosecuted.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.183]  They say that a bakery in Northern Iraq is a bioweapons lab.
[00:44:04.204 --> 00:44:06.766]  The BBC's in there the next day, it's a bakery.
[00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.711]  They say, oh, look at these mobile trucks.
[00:44:11.251 --> 00:44:12.992]  These are for biological weapons.
[00:44:13.032 --> 00:44:14.552]  It turns out they knew day one.
[00:44:14.572 --> 00:44:17.273]  It was in Jane's Weapons Encyclopedia.
[00:44:17.653 --> 00:44:19.234]  It had the serial numbers on it.
[00:44:19.294 --> 00:44:30.597]  In British, it was also in Arabic, that they were for pumping up hydrogen artillery balloons, surveillance balloons for trench warfare from the 1980s Iran-Iraq War.
[00:44:31.018 --> 00:44:34.919]  They bought two trucks from the British and three trucks from the Russians.
[00:44:36.895 --> 00:44:43.040]  And our government, the British government, they knew day one what those were because our governments have them.
[00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:50.266]  You go to South Texas, they've got hundreds of these trucks at Fort Bliss, Joint Task Force 6.
[00:44:50.366 --> 00:44:59.314]  They knew exactly what it was, but it had some tanks on it so they could point at it and say, look, there's the bad guy.
[00:45:01.391 --> 00:45:04.153]  And I don't want to hear, oh, you're a liberal, you're against these wars.
[00:45:04.213 --> 00:45:04.953]  Give me a break.
[00:45:05.013 --> 00:45:08.255]  Chuckie Schumer, Hillary Clinton were the most enthusiastic.
[00:45:09.016 --> 00:45:13.338]  And Ron Paul and others, the most conservative members of Congress, were against it.
[00:45:14.639 --> 00:45:16.160]  So I don't want to hear it anymore, okay?
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.641]  And now they're saying they're going into Syria, Iran.
[00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:20.462]  Well, we told you they were.
[00:45:20.923 --> 00:45:21.503]  PNAC.
[00:45:22.944 --> 00:45:25.105]  I found out about PNAC two years ago, okay?
[00:45:25.145 --> 00:45:25.865]  I dropped the ball.
[00:45:26.046 --> 00:45:28.387]  Most people found out about it two months ago on Nightline.
[00:45:29.983 --> 00:45:38.086]  Here's PNAC publicly, eight years ago, saying we need terrorist attacks to get the American people behind imperial mobilization.
[00:45:38.126 --> 00:45:40.026]  We want to invade 62 countries.
[00:45:40.366 --> 00:45:42.047]  We're going to take all the rights away.
[00:45:42.147 --> 00:45:43.147]  Ha ha ha!
[00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:50.890]  Written by Jeb Bush, Wolfowitz, Perl, and all these other creatures.
[00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:57.712]  The Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, where they say Saddam isn't a threat,
[00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.431]  It was this big debate.
[00:45:59.751 --> 00:46:00.652]  Is it about oil?
[00:46:00.772 --> 00:46:02.133]  Is it about global domination?
[00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:07.476]  We're having a debate about it when they wrote stuff 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:46:09.958 --> 00:46:11.719]  Every year they wrote these reports!
[00:46:14.601 --> 00:46:20.645]  So, I'm going to try to stop ranting and raving because I said I'm going to cover all the news on the show today and it's all just totally insane.
[00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:26.674]  Just rampant corruption at every level, at every fashion.
[00:46:27.595 --> 00:46:28.355]  I am blown away.
[00:46:28.735 --> 00:46:31.136]  I am staggering.
[00:46:31.696 --> 00:46:32.297]  Staggered.
[00:46:33.337 --> 00:46:33.937]  Dazed.
[00:46:34.138 --> 00:46:34.998]  Dumbfounded.
[00:46:35.098 --> 00:46:35.858]  Bamboozled.
[00:46:36.018 --> 00:46:50.445]  It's just flagrant gun-grabbing, open borders, government exploding in size, all these new federal agencies, continuity of government, martial law activated.
[00:46:51.753 --> 00:46:53.333]  Giant prisons everywhere.
[00:46:53.654 --> 00:46:55.914]  Thumb scanners going in grocery stores.
[00:46:56.554 --> 00:46:59.135]  School children biometrically scanning to get food.
[00:46:59.435 --> 00:47:01.516]  RFID tags going in everything.
[00:47:01.976 --> 00:47:04.237]  The feds are land grabbing everywhere.
[00:47:04.417 --> 00:47:06.497]  SWAT teams are killing innocent people.
[00:47:06.837 --> 00:47:08.078]  Killing innocent cops.
[00:47:08.558 --> 00:47:09.758]  Foaming at the mouth.
[00:47:10.438 --> 00:47:12.279]  Running around slaughtering us.
[00:47:13.239 --> 00:47:33.363]  Crime labs at state and federal level, planning evidence, FBI dealing drugs, running murder for hire operations, government shipping in heroin and cocaine, running the prostitution, running child kidnapping rings, the occult's on the rise, exploding everywhere, just bedlam.
[00:47:35.724 --> 00:47:38.164]  Total and complete insanity.
[00:47:39.164 --> 00:47:41.825]  And CPS grabbing millions of kids a year,
[00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:45.192]  Convicted pedophiles running the databases.
[00:47:45.852 --> 00:47:48.454]  Just wall-to-wall insanity.
[00:47:50.514 --> 00:47:51.855]  It's off the charts, folks.
[00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:54.436]  It is just off the charts.
[00:47:55.937 --> 00:47:57.918]  And I'm having a normal response to this.
[00:47:58.098 --> 00:47:59.578]  Ridge's fat head.
[00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:04.981]  One great example is he said, uh, you know, you gotta use duct tape and all this to keep yourself safe.
[00:48:05.001 --> 00:48:05.761]  You gotta do all this.
[00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:09.323]  And then a week later, I got him on tape saying, a lot of people put out bad information.
[00:48:09.363 --> 00:48:11.484]  We gotta stop them without any duct tape and all this.
[00:48:11.544 --> 00:48:12.024]  It's stupid.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.480]  It's just they have no respect for you.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:21.542]  It's just up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black, left is right, right is left.
[00:48:22.842 --> 00:48:28.303]  And they're doing it on purpose to confuse you so your thinking process will just shut down.
[00:48:28.343 --> 00:48:30.643]  Well, my process isn't going to shut down.
[00:48:31.043 --> 00:48:33.164]  Are you willing to speculate in today's market?
[00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:36.764]  Options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[00:48:37.265 --> 00:48:39.285]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[00:48:39.645 --> 00:48:43.327]  Right now we're recommending the purchase of euro currency call options.
[00:48:43.647 --> 00:48:45.668]  The budget and trade deficits are going through the roof.
[00:48:46.028 --> 00:48:47.849]  The dollar is dropping worldwide.
[00:48:48.189 --> 00:48:49.730]  Could the euro be poised to move higher?
[00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:50.671]  We think so.

[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.623]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[00:50:55.724 --> 00:51:06.372]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.

[00:51:44.707 --> 00:51:50.870]  All right, I know we've got loaded phones and we're going to start the second hour here in about five and a half minutes.

[00:51:58.773 --> 00:52:02.594]  Let me kind of give you a review of what's coming up.
[00:52:02.854 --> 00:52:08.617]  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a board full of calls in the next hour.
[00:52:08.637 --> 00:52:09.837]  I'm going to try to go to you quickly.
[00:52:10.317 --> 00:52:11.418]  I've really gotten bad about
[00:52:12.222 --> 00:52:15.424]  Going on and on with the callers and everybody doesn't get a chance to get on the show.
[00:52:15.444 --> 00:52:21.287]  We've been ending too many shows with loaded phones, so I want to just go to your calls quickly today.
[00:52:21.307 --> 00:52:22.468]  I want to take a lot of calls.
[00:52:22.488 --> 00:52:23.128]  800-259-9231.
[00:52:24.929 --> 00:52:30.012]  This is some of the news that's coming up.
[00:52:30.412 --> 00:52:34.874]  Ashcroft Grandstands says there's a plot to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge and he saved you from it.
[00:52:34.914 --> 00:52:41.358]  You can't believe anything that comes out of their mouth in any of these plea bargains because they admit they tortured terrorist suspects.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.423]  Also, paganism, witchcraft on the rise in the UK.
[00:52:45.543 --> 00:52:56.190]  They admit that it's the fastest growing religion, and not surprisingly, they're finding a lot of dead animals and dead kids in Europe and in the US, and they think it's real funny, and we'll talk about it.
[00:52:56.491 --> 00:53:00.714]  And I heard neocons on the air this morning saying, oh, there's nothing wrong with Harry Potter.
[00:53:01.776 --> 00:53:02.597]  Okay, fine.
[00:53:03.397 --> 00:53:06.039]  Then just, you know, go ahead and join the Church of Satan, then.
[00:53:06.499 --> 00:53:12.763]  Because it is designed to get your kids into this, turn on the television, they're promoting it wall to wall.
[00:53:13.943 --> 00:53:16.045]  Also, offer Iraqi deals.
[00:53:16.145 --> 00:53:25.030]  British urge the US, they say, hey, offer people cash payments, incentives, amnesty, if they say that they saw weapons of mass destruction.
[00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:26.831]  So again, you gonna believe that when they say it?
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.460]  That's coming up.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.842]  Lack of spies in Baghdad spurs CIA to bolster ranks.
[00:53:31.882 --> 00:53:37.205]  They now have the CIA running the hunt for the weapons of mass destruction situation.
[00:53:38.865 --> 00:53:38.945]  U.S.
[00:53:38.985 --> 00:53:45.208]  accuses Iran of pattern of nuclear violations and says they may use force very soon against them.
[00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:50.571]  So, screws tightened over Iran over nuclear ambitions.
[00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:53.472]  Military action against Iran an option, U.S.
[00:53:53.512 --> 00:53:54.433]  official says.
[00:53:56.142 --> 00:54:00.863]  Also, I want to get into court order keeping men quarantined in Dallas.
[00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:06.285]  This whole quarantine situation is the perfect way to install their police state.
[00:54:06.365 --> 00:54:08.006]  And this has been their plan for years.
[00:54:08.046 --> 00:54:08.806]  We've been covering it.
[00:54:09.606 --> 00:54:12.947]  University study, Ritalin may worsen cocaine abuse.
[00:54:13.027 --> 00:54:13.847]  I will cover this today.
[00:54:13.907 --> 00:54:14.988]  I didn't get to it yesterday.
[00:54:15.008 --> 00:54:21.189]  Another article about what Paxil's doing.
[00:54:21.209 --> 00:54:22.650]  They're saying don't take it if you're under 18.
[00:54:24.514 --> 00:54:31.557]  Yeah, they covered that up in the trials for Prozac in 83.
[00:54:32.698 --> 00:54:34.599]  It puts you in a mesmerized state.
[00:54:35.459 --> 00:54:44.703]  So that's coming up as well in the next hour and just a whole plethora of other news and information as I end this hour.
[00:54:46.585 --> 00:54:50.129]  I do want to encourage you to get involved in the fight to wake people up.
[00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:56.877]  Ashcroft calls on the media to help him lie to the people about the Patriot Act, which he's been doing, caught red-handed.
[00:54:57.898 --> 00:55:01.082]  And so it's up to you to get Police State 3 total enslavement.
[00:55:01.627 --> 00:55:03.429]  Two hours, forty minutes long.
[00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.735]  Forty-five minutes of it is about Patriot Act 1 and 2 and Homeland Security.
[00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:13.001]  The actual subsections, video clips of Ashcroft saying different things on different dates.

[00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.091]  The videos are a key way to get the job done.

[00:56:31.338 --> 00:56:31.958]  Absolutely.

[00:56:46.744 --> 00:56:47.405]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.045 --> 00:56:49.145]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:50.986]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.006 --> 00:56:52.427]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.147 --> 00:56:54.047]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.067 --> 00:56:58.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:03.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.083 --> 00:57:08.424]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:57:08.644 --> 00:57:09.305]  Welcome back.
[00:57:10.505 --> 00:57:15.789]  We're already into the second hour of this live Friday edition.
[00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:20.072]  Paul, Bob, Kevin, Michael, Mark, and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:57:20.432 --> 00:57:21.153]  I will get into
[00:57:22.532 --> 00:57:26.856]  Well, the mainstream is now admitting what we've known about Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[00:57:26.916 --> 00:57:39.288]  They cause serious health problems, suicide and psychotic breaks, and increase the likelihood that someone will be a substance abuser and will be more addicted if they ever use controlled substances.
[00:57:40.405 --> 00:57:46.226]  Also Ashcroft says that the Patriot Act doesn't take your rights and asks the media to help him lie to everyone.
[00:57:46.266 --> 00:57:46.966]  That's what he's doing.
[00:57:47.486 --> 00:57:51.307]  He says, help us tell everybody that there isn't any of your liberties being lost.
[00:57:51.647 --> 00:57:54.228]  This guy dwarfs Clinton when it comes to bald-faced lying.
[00:57:54.248 --> 00:58:00.189]  Monsanto is now having people arrested and taken to the court they own in St.
[00:58:00.269 --> 00:58:00.629]  Louis.
[00:58:00.749 --> 00:58:02.109]  Doesn't matter where you are in the country.
[00:58:02.509 --> 00:58:05.830]  You go to their court, special federal law, in St.
[00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:07.710]  Louis with their base where you get prison time.
[00:58:08.847 --> 00:58:09.768]  That's all coming up.
[00:58:09.788 --> 00:58:11.589]  So big show today.
[00:58:11.609 --> 00:58:12.149]  Stay with us.
[00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:14.091]  Paul in Indiana.
[00:58:14.351 --> 00:58:15.051]  You're on the air.
[00:58:15.111 --> 00:58:15.772]  First caller.
[00:58:15.812 --> 00:58:16.192]  Welcome.
[00:58:16.412 --> 00:58:16.932]  Hi Alex.
[00:58:17.353 --> 00:58:17.813]  How you doing?
[00:58:18.113 --> 00:58:18.573]  Doing good.
[00:58:18.613 --> 00:58:19.114]  How about you?
[00:58:20.615 --> 00:58:21.675]  I'm honored to be on the air.
[00:58:21.735 --> 00:58:22.316]  Glad I'm here.
[00:58:22.576 --> 00:58:23.116]  I am too.
[00:58:23.557 --> 00:58:28.300]  Hey, got a lot on my mind, but I'll just try to cover the most important stuff.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:36.725]  I guess I was driving down the road the other day and I saw a big billboard that said sobriety checkpoint ahead.
[00:58:38.226 --> 00:58:41.067]  And it kind of threw me for a loop.
[00:58:41.087 --> 00:58:45.990]  I guess it was more of just like an intimidation kind of thing than anything else.
[00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:47.510]  Why, because you didn't see a checkpoint?
[00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:49.331]  No, there was no checkpoint.
[00:58:49.371 --> 00:58:50.152]  Well, let me tell you.
[00:58:50.912 --> 00:58:54.814]  The National Seat Belt Initiative passed in 98, billions of funding a year.
[00:58:55.666 --> 00:59:10.478]  says that it is to have checkpoints, to have the flashing billboards, the emergency billboards, the traffic billboards, to get you ready for internal checkpoints, to be built into the roads and internal toll roads, so that's what you're saying is just an acclimation period.
[00:59:10.678 --> 00:59:10.918]  Right.
[00:59:11.819 --> 00:59:24.769]  In regards to the Patriot Act and the new definition of terrorism, I wrote to my senator here in Indiana and it was a point-blank question that said
[00:59:25.627 --> 00:59:35.832]  According to the Patriot Act, I quoted the bill and said, this is the new definition of terrorism, and do you agree with this definition?
[00:59:36.233 --> 00:59:51.621]  And, of course, I got a generic boilerplate letter back that said, you know, the Patriot Act was passed 99 to 1 in the Senate, blah, blah, blah, and, you know... Yeah, while the Senate was under anthrax attack by the CIA,
[00:59:54.056 --> 01:00:01.722]  Anyway, how do you get answers from these public officials?
[01:00:01.862 --> 01:00:06.005]  Another one, they're not officials and they're not authorities, they're a bunch of criminals.
[01:00:07.246 --> 01:00:08.006]  I realize that.
[01:00:08.026 --> 01:00:17.233]  And back when they weren't crooks, they were called public servants, but now they tell you to call them officials and authorities.
[01:00:17.593 --> 01:00:18.794]  And they're not any of that.
[01:00:19.034 --> 01:00:21.156]  They're a pack of looting thugs.
[01:00:21.727 --> 01:00:28.555]  So is there any way to really call these guys to the carpet and get them to answer the questions directly?
[01:00:28.615 --> 01:00:32.540]  Yeah, you've got to show 100 people the bill in subsection 802.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:38.147]  So when they hear Ashcroft lying, they'll know he's a liar and that'll make them angry and make them investigate more.
[01:00:38.447 --> 01:00:39.428]  That's it, huh?
[01:00:39.448 --> 01:00:44.551]  You just gotta go, here's the bill, Library of Congress, here's the section, he says it doesn't affect you, it does.
[01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:54.518]  You can show them the Washington Times from Monday where they say it's for all citizens, Justice Department, all crimes, and then show them Ashcroft saying it isn't, and you're a terrorist if you say it does affect you!
[01:00:54.878 --> 01:00:55.158]  Right.
[01:00:55.979 --> 01:01:01.363]  I have this guy on tape saying that if you say the Patriot Act takes liberties, you're helping the terrorists.
[01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:01.943]  I saw it.
[01:01:03.004 --> 01:01:03.624]  Yeah, I saw it.
[01:01:03.684 --> 01:01:05.425]  Oh, so you've seen Police State 3?
[01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:07.667]  No, I saw, uh,

[01:02:41.437 --> 01:02:45.801]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:45.982 --> 01:02:50.406]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:50.546 --> 01:02:54.910]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.312]  A New World Order.
[01:02:57.237 --> 01:02:58.878]  You will lose your liberty.

[01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:45.248]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:48.731]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.352 --> 01:05:00.438]  Mass quarantining.
[01:05:00.678 --> 01:05:01.898]  Forced injections.
[01:05:01.979 --> 01:05:03.179]  Part of federal law.
[01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:05.721]  Page 76 of the Homeland Security.
[01:05:08.422 --> 01:05:12.284]  Now they've quarantined somebody in Dallas claiming it's SARS or fear-mongering.
[01:05:12.964 --> 01:05:14.565]  I was watching the news last night.
[01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:19.047]  MSNBC and CNN mentioned possible martial law.
[01:05:19.067 --> 01:05:22.529]  They're getting that term into our nomenclature now.
[01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:24.730]  Did you ever think you'd hear them talk about martial law?
[01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.311]  But they said, hey, it's the new wave.
[01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:30.733]  Emerging viruses and bacteria and
[01:05:31.576 --> 01:05:36.160]  Just get used to being locked down in your cities and thousands of you being quarantined.
[01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:38.302]  It's for your safety, see?
[01:05:38.663 --> 01:05:40.204]  Oh, and the terrorists are going to get us, too.
[01:05:40.244 --> 01:05:41.986]  We've got to be quarantined and locked down.
[01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.913]  Scrutinized by the Pentagon and the CIA acting domestically.
[01:05:46.993 --> 01:05:48.734]  It's all for our safety.
[01:05:48.774 --> 01:05:53.378]  Just all these reasons that the border stays wide open.
[01:05:53.818 --> 01:06:01.905]  We got SARS and West Nile and monkeypox all showing up right on time and the globalist policy papers said that they needed
[01:06:02.777 --> 01:06:07.242]  Biological attacks are the threat of it to install their police state and they're doing it.
[01:06:07.823 --> 01:06:11.286]  Coming up, FDA, Paxil may be linked to suicide in kids.
[01:06:11.727 --> 01:06:13.789]  Well, the whole class of psychotropics are.
[01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:18.534]  And I've been covering this ever since I got on the air eight, nine years ago.
[01:06:19.515 --> 01:06:22.238]  They're now admitting Ritalin is killing kids and is very deadly.
[01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.620]  Those stories are coming up.
[01:06:24.764 --> 01:06:28.866]  We've had the doctors, the scientists, the researchers on to talk about this.
[01:06:28.926 --> 01:06:32.909]  They knew it in 83 when they did the trials of Prozac.
[01:06:33.909 --> 01:06:37.912]  There were massive numbers of suicides and murders.
[01:06:38.889 --> 01:06:40.030]  In adults taking it.
[01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:58.678]  And now, CPS, when they seize your toddler, when the child cries, when it's locked up, in Florida, it was one of the worst states in mental institutions, it's an overflow facility, when your child cries, it's mental illness, they're putting them on Prozac, and Paxil, and other drugs.
[01:06:59.318 --> 01:07:06.762]  And now the Supreme Court's ruled, they arrest you, they can just go ahead and drug you and get you ready for trial, for criminal charges.
[01:07:08.462 --> 01:07:11.606]  So that's coming up as well, the Sovietization of America.
[01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:13.007]  Right now let's go to the calls.
[01:07:13.107 --> 01:07:15.169]  Bob in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.071]  Welcome Alex, how are you today?
[01:07:17.172 --> 01:07:17.752]  Good my friend.
[01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:18.593]  How's your finger?
[01:07:19.534 --> 01:07:19.734]  Better?
[01:07:19.754 --> 01:07:21.817]  Oh it's good, it's healing nicely.
[01:07:22.117 --> 01:07:23.378]  Oh good, I'm glad to hear that.
[01:07:23.438 --> 01:07:24.940]  We don't want you losing a finger.
[01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:29.305]  Hey, I want to point out to the listeners and yourself,
[01:07:30.154 --> 01:07:32.896]  The dialectic that's going on here.
[01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.798]  Well, explain what a dialectic is first.
[01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:39.381]  Well, it's thesis, anti-thesis.
[01:07:39.862 --> 01:07:42.844]  Let's pit the left against the right continuously.
[01:07:42.884 --> 01:07:44.866]  You can hear it on the right-wing talk shows.
[01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:50.150]  They're demonizing Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton constantly.
[01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.811]  I mean, this is like their only topic.
[01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:53.492]  The guy isn't president anymore.
[01:07:54.213 --> 01:07:56.314]  He's gone away and they just keep hammering him.
[01:07:56.755 --> 01:07:58.136]  But the point I'm trying to make here
[01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:27.221]  is that they're gonna run somebody in the democratic uh... election here coming up for the presidency and he's already been chosen i called this a year ago his name is bob kerry what they're doing is they're playing this game with bush they're gonna demonize him which he is a demon but what's the good cop bad cop scenario now kerry voted for patriot act did he not?
[01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:29.760]  Yes, he did.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.141]  Yeah, but he's one of them, too.
[01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:35.704]  He's also a member of the Skull and Bones Club.
[01:08:35.724 --> 01:08:39.066]  Well, it's like Senator Graham out of Florida.
[01:08:39.106 --> 01:08:45.570]  He didn't author it, and then he's out giving speeches against it, but only saying it needs to be amended.
[01:08:46.031 --> 01:08:48.552]  See, legitimizing it, that's how they control debates.
[01:08:48.812 --> 01:08:49.953]  And let me break this down.
[01:08:50.774 --> 01:08:53.776]  By all the neocons talking about Hillary,
[01:08:54.514 --> 01:08:58.317]  They're actually selling her book of lies for her.
[01:08:58.597 --> 01:08:59.138]  Exactly.
[01:08:59.198 --> 01:09:03.261]  And they're acting like Hillary and Bill actually ran something when they're just puppets.
[01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:14.450]  But the neocons, as they make Bush look good by bashing Clinton, won't mention that Bush is expanding every Clinton policy from gun control to national service to open borders.
[01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:19.294]  They won't mention that Bush is blocking Dan Burton's committee investigating Pardongate.
[01:09:20.015 --> 01:09:21.538]  So he's protecting Bill Clinton?
[01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:22.620]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:26.446]  So they don't see, they'll talk about how the border's open, but won't tell you why?
[01:09:26.846 --> 01:09:30.332]  And why are so many people resigning from the Bush administration?
[01:09:30.822 --> 01:09:38.008]  I mean, you've got Larry Lindsey, Economic Advisor, you've got Paul O'Neill, and a slew of others, even Arlie... Well, I'll tell you why.
[01:09:38.208 --> 01:09:45.954]  Because if they get out in six years or five years when Bush ends his second term, they won't have the pull.
[01:09:46.374 --> 01:09:54.741]  But if they get out early, they'll have a few years guaranteed, even if Bush loses the election, to cash in on the influence they have.
[01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:58.184]  They're also putting their millions in key infrastructure positions.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:07.663]  You know, a long time ago, Alex, I vowed to myself that I would never vote for a Democrat or a Republican ever again.
[01:10:07.683 --> 01:10:08.584]  Okay?
[01:10:08.924 --> 01:10:14.346]  And that's a hard thing to do when you see this Nazi getting in and doing all this creepy stuff.
[01:10:14.846 --> 01:10:22.489]  But I gotta say that I also can see the forest through the trees and recognize that, you know, Kerry is just a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:10:22.769 --> 01:10:26.250]  They're members of the same secret society
[01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:29.076]  Sworn to destroy America.
[01:10:29.136 --> 01:10:29.917]  That is admitted.
[01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:30.817]  Skull and bones.
[01:10:31.297 --> 01:10:32.817]  Sworn to destroy America.
[01:10:33.937 --> 01:10:35.238]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:10:35.258 --> 01:10:35.838]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:36.578 --> 01:10:37.118]  I've got to let you go.
[01:10:37.138 --> 01:10:38.018]  I've got a lot of callers here.
[01:10:38.378 --> 01:10:39.259]  Kevin and Mass.
[01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:40.159]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:10:40.219 --> 01:10:40.779]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:10:40.799 --> 01:10:41.719]  Hi.
[01:10:42.319 --> 01:10:48.761]  I got a caller I was listening to on your show the other day, Alex, who was very intrigued by what you were saying.
[01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:50.421]  And I know you've helped
[01:10:51.972 --> 01:10:58.175]  Wake me up to the lies in the media and to look to alternative sources such as yourself, which is my favorite source for the truth.
[01:10:59.175 --> 01:11:03.677]  But he was looking for some other sources for things like Bohemian Grove.
[01:11:03.757 --> 01:11:19.703]  The tales are so unbelievable, it is hard to believe, and I just wanted to recommend a couple of things, like there's a book called The Franklin Cover-Up by ex-Republican Senator John DeCamp, talking about some of the same things that go on in Bohemian Grove.
[01:11:21.284 --> 01:11:21.444]  Hello?
[01:11:22.168 --> 01:11:23.148]  Oh yeah, I'm listening to you.
[01:11:23.308 --> 01:11:25.209]  Okay, sir.
[01:11:25.389 --> 01:11:30.670]  Another, you know, Alex, you tend to come from a background of Republicanism.
[01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:36.612]  There's a guy that previously would have been in the Democratic Party, his name's Sherm Skolnick.
[01:11:36.672 --> 01:11:37.592]  I read some of him.
[01:11:37.932 --> 01:11:41.273]  Again, you're my favorite source, but you'll see some people from different walks of life.
[01:11:41.293 --> 01:11:42.493]  Well, I mean, I've had Skolnick, sir.
[01:11:42.653 --> 01:11:44.214]  I've had Skolnick on five times.
[01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:45.554]  I've had DeCamp on probably
[01:11:46.696 --> 01:11:47.717]  Five or six times.
[01:11:48.959 --> 01:12:03.754]  I've interviewed all these people, but people can't believe Bohemian Grove that Bush and these guys go and that male prostitutes are trucked in from all over the world, flown in by private jet, that they do bizarre satanic rituals.
[01:12:03.854 --> 01:12:05.937]  But I have the Washington Times.
[01:12:06.813 --> 01:12:19.400]  I have the Sacramento Bee, I have Parade Magazine, I have Spy Magazine, I have all these articles in my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, where mainstream news admits.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:27.024]  I have the Washington Times saying that they have giant homosexual orgies at the Republican compound there at Bohemian Grove.
[01:12:27.065 --> 01:12:28.625]  Now that's the Washington Times!
[01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:31.487]  I have the Bohemian Grove Club in
[01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:37.862]  Uh, the national video that aired on the TRIO Network and all over Europe and Japan.
[01:12:37.882 --> 01:12:40.343]  But it's aired right here on our national TV.
[01:12:40.683 --> 01:12:45.385]  And they admit at the end of the film that I did sneak in and I did get the ritual on video.
[01:12:45.485 --> 01:12:46.425]  They say, so what?
[01:12:47.186 --> 01:12:50.327]  You know, they're just having fun dressing up in these satanic outfits.
[01:12:50.827 --> 01:12:53.708]  Your videos, um, hit you right in the face and show it.
[01:12:53.728 --> 01:12:57.009]  I've got the Bohemian Grove, the 9-11 Road to Fear, and the Masters of Terror.
[01:12:57.149 --> 01:13:02.411]  I mean, the point I'm making here, though, is that I'll be on a so-called conservative Christian talk show,
[01:13:03.786 --> 01:13:16.350]  And the so-called Christian leader will say, well, yes, I'm a Mason, I'm also a Baptist, and let me tell you, the Bohemian Grove, you're a liar, you're a devil for saying this about Bush, and I go, Bush admits he goes there.
[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.891]  Nope, it's not true, listeners.
[01:13:19.151 --> 01:13:20.351]  That's all they've got.
[01:13:20.832 --> 01:13:21.892]  It's like Ashcroft.
[01:13:21.952 --> 01:13:24.053]  They just deny things that are a fact.
[01:13:24.753 --> 01:13:30.575]  I have a member of a group that has some Masons that I'm friends with in it, and we were talking about 9-11, and I was
[01:13:32.165 --> 01:13:33.385]  You know, just hitting them with facts.
[01:13:33.445 --> 01:13:39.107]  And they were trying to undermine my argument with just saying it's a lie, but I was hitting them with documented facts that you presented.
[01:13:39.647 --> 01:13:46.429]  And so, basically, I was kind of stunned, which they never cease to do, and hit with a statement, well, at least now they fear us.
[01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:48.669]  Who they are, I don't know that we want to fear us.
[01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:51.870]  But he stopped trying to say that it wasn't true.
[01:13:52.612 --> 01:13:55.515]  And basically saying even if it is true, tough, they fear us.
[01:13:55.615 --> 01:14:02.741]  I know a lot of good old boys that got the million dollar house and the jet boats and the good looking wife and the business.
[01:14:03.682 --> 01:14:06.304]  And they'll go, Alex, I've seen your information.
[01:14:06.364 --> 01:14:07.405]  All right, they did it.
[01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:10.627]  We need to do this to expand America.
[01:14:11.107 --> 01:14:12.528]  America is dying.
[01:14:12.588 --> 01:14:13.949]  The liberties are disappearing.
[01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.911]  The industries are disappearing.
[01:14:16.191 --> 01:14:26.678]  The energy that was left in America is being used to empower the New World Order, destroy the image of America worldwide, and demonize us, and legitimize the UN.
[01:14:27.119 --> 01:14:28.720]  That's what's happening in a nutshell.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:29.220]  Right.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.021]  It's not Democrats.
[01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:31.021]  It's not Republicans.
[01:14:31.041 --> 01:14:31.942]  It's globalist
[01:14:32.222 --> 01:14:32.982]  It's a good term.
[01:14:33.483 --> 01:14:35.903]  It's the central bankers of the world.
[01:14:36.564 --> 01:14:51.009]  JFK has said in his inaugural address, those who try to gain power by riding the back of the tiger usually end up inside, and that's what they don't realize is that they think they're a group that's in, and they will turn on these lower-level people as well.
[01:14:51.049 --> 01:14:53.049]  It's the super elite that is running this thing.
[01:14:53.269 --> 01:14:53.769]  Absolutely.
[01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:54.410]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:57.631]  Let's talk to Michael in New York.
[01:14:57.731 --> 01:14:58.671]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:14:58.691 --> 01:14:59.071]  Go ahead.
[01:15:01.505 --> 01:15:03.566]  I thought you wanted to call a poll we called in before.
[01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:06.827]  He was referring to the checkpoints and all that he found.
[01:15:06.847 --> 01:15:13.990]  Yeah, they have big signs now, the so-called traffic billboards, flash, checkpoint ahead, training you to accept it, you know.
[01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:14.730]  Right, right.
[01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:20.352]  I mean, these guys are calling people by citizen, saying you're a citizen only, and
[01:15:23.772 --> 01:15:29.815]  Basically, it's going to be... And the police call us civilians, since when were we under a military dictatorship?
[01:15:29.955 --> 01:15:40.341]  Yeah, it was like when they present like a family in an average American car, like a Ford or Chevy, drives up, they're supposed to be a husband and wife in the front seat, so they drive up to the checkpoint, Corporal comes up and says, may I see your identification, citizen?
[01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:46.344]  Like, you know, it's like, it's definitely a mode of control, it's Soviet, definitely.
[01:15:47.964 --> 01:15:52.627]  And also, John Kerry actually did propose a bill last year that would enhance
[01:15:53.703 --> 01:16:03.642]  Um, these checkpoints in our public transportation... Well, I mean, they're floating an article where Kerry said that war with Iraq was good, but Clinton was doing it in 97, and they go,
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.181]  He's for it, see?
[01:16:06.281 --> 01:16:07.281]  Yeah, that's the point.
[01:16:07.581 --> 01:16:08.982]  It's all rhetoric.
[01:16:09.362 --> 01:16:14.025]  Just because Kerry was for the war, and then now was against it, doesn't mean the war was good.
[01:16:14.305 --> 01:16:16.146]  It shows what a bunch of whores they are.
[01:16:16.266 --> 01:16:21.329]  Yeah, he's a Skull and Bones as well as George Bush, and that's who's going to be debating next year if we don't do anything about it now.
[01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:21.709]  That's it.
[01:16:21.749 --> 01:16:23.510]  The first Skull and Bones presidency.
[01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:25.011]  Either way, you cut it or slice it.
[01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:26.392]  A rigged game.
[01:16:27.752 --> 01:16:29.273]  Do you want to continue or are you done?
[01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.234]  No, I actually have one more thing.
[01:16:31.314 --> 01:16:32.235]  Okay, stay there, Michael.
[01:16:32.998 --> 01:16:35.881]  We'll come back and talk to Mark and Ed and many others.
[01:16:36.742 --> 01:16:38.284]  Wide open phones on this Friday.
[01:16:38.484 --> 01:16:40.466]  Talking about real issues that actually affect you.
[01:16:40.486 --> 01:16:41.527]  Infowars.com
[01:16:43.695 --> 01:16:48.198]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.539 --> 01:16:52.622]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:52.922 --> 01:16:53.462]  We listened.
[01:16:53.782 --> 01:16:58.766]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.026 --> 01:16:59.527]  We listened.
[01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:02.949]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:03.890]  We listened.
[01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:08.412]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:09.273]  We listened.
[01:17:09.633 --> 01:17:14.875]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:17:15.276 --> 01:17:16.656]  Again, we listened.
[01:17:17.016 --> 01:17:24.380]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:29.082]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium

[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.766]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:42.322 --> 01:17:47.564]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:50.445]  It's the 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values.
[01:17:50.705 --> 01:17:56.527]  I love going to all the big gun shows, and now I can buy with the comfort of knowing exactly what that old Winchester is really worth.
[01:17:56.947 --> 01:18:02.550]  Armed with the 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values makes you more knowledgeable and makes gun collecting more profitable.
[01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:09.032]  The 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains more information and firearm values than any other publication.
[01:18:09.372 --> 01:18:13.674]  Over 1,600 pages with the most accurate firearm prices available.
[01:18:14.014 --> 01:18:18.575]  The 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains nearly 1 million words of text.
[01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:24.097]  No other book even comes close and most of the information in this publication is not available anywhere else.
[01:18:24.678 --> 01:18:25.998]  Take the guesswork out of your next
[01:18:26.078 --> 01:18:26.498]  That's right.
[01:18:41.332 --> 01:18:45.577]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:46.037 --> 01:18:50.582]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:50.962 --> 01:18:55.827]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:57.989]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:58.029 --> 01:18:59.051]  can barely be read.
[01:18:59.351 --> 01:19:00.312]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:04.555]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:04.816 --> 01:19:13.203]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.

[01:20:45.087 --> 01:20:51.128]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:51.728 --> 01:20:54.689]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:57.114 --> 01:21:00.756]  Waging war on corruption, crashing for lies and disinformation.
[01:21:01.896 --> 01:21:06.759]  I wanted Michael in New York to hold on so he could finish his comments after the break, but he hung up, so we'll go back to the calls.
[01:21:07.599 --> 01:21:15.083]  And then in the next segment, I'm going to dive into the news, the drugging of our children, the police state, World War III, the globalists are setting up.
[01:21:15.223 --> 01:21:17.204]  It's all coming up, folks, so stay with us.
[01:21:18.005 --> 01:21:19.225]  Mark in Colorado.
[01:21:19.285 --> 01:21:20.126]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:20.606]  Go ahead.
[01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:23.168]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:21:23.388 --> 01:21:23.848]  You bet, sir.
[01:21:25.154 --> 01:21:28.355]  I have a footnote for you regarding the checkpoint issue.
[01:21:28.995 --> 01:21:47.638]  Yesterday I was listening to a Denver-based talk show and the host of the show was pointing out what he believed to be facts regarding drunk driving as the basis for substantiating news that had come out on ABC regarding a national crackdown on drunk drivers.
[01:21:47.739 --> 01:21:49.459]  It's supposed to begin on June 27th
[01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:52.092]  And go through July 13th.
[01:21:52.713 --> 01:21:58.397]  And notice last month we had a month-long crackdown on wearing your seatbelt.
[01:21:58.417 --> 01:22:01.419]  See, this is funded by billions of dollars.
[01:22:01.579 --> 01:22:12.288]  It is officially stated in the National Seatbelt Initiative, Part 3 of the four-part plan, that it is to train us for internal checkpoints to be funded by toll roads.
[01:22:12.588 --> 01:22:14.910]  We're going across state lines or entering cities.
[01:22:15.190 --> 01:22:18.833]  Your cars will be searched, just like the airports.
[01:22:19.537 --> 01:22:23.180]  And you look at them wrong, they're going to charge you criminally.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:23.660]  Go ahead.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:31.225]  Well, what I was going to say was that the information they were passing out was a little bit alarming.
[01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:45.675]  The talk show host was saying that the news that he got from ABC purported to say that one drunk driver or person dies in a drunk driving accident every 30 seconds.
[01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:47.917]  Well, if you crunch the numbers on that,
[01:22:48.959 --> 01:22:53.163]  You come up with over a million people a year, which I know has to be a lot.
[01:22:53.784 --> 01:22:56.907]  Yeah, there's not that many automobile accidents.
[01:22:56.967 --> 01:22:57.888]  Of course they lie.
[01:22:57.908 --> 01:22:59.149]  That's all they do is lie.
[01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.011]  Well, I agree with you there.
[01:23:01.051 --> 01:23:01.632]  You know what?
[01:23:01.672 --> 01:23:03.514]  I called this guy up and I challenged him.
[01:23:03.594 --> 01:23:05.836]  I said, look, you're talking about 2880 people a day.
[01:23:08.314 --> 01:23:10.035]  Well look, they know how to sell us stuff.
[01:23:10.135 --> 01:23:11.336]  Take the EAS system.
[01:23:11.396 --> 01:23:11.917]  You know what EAS is?
[01:23:27.415 --> 01:23:27.755]  No it don't.
[01:23:28.255 --> 01:23:38.479]  Emergency alert system by law 96 all radio and TV stations at FEMA takeover boxes by remote control by radio and satellite.
[01:23:38.899 --> 01:23:43.021]  TV stations have satellite radio stations have radio boxes put in.
[01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:45.362]  Everything must be wired through the box
[01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:47.831]  It is a FEMA takeover system.
[01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:50.333]  The billboards, the traffic cameras, federally funded.
[01:23:50.694 --> 01:23:52.695]  It's all part of this command and control system.
[01:23:53.075 --> 01:23:55.137]  They put the FEMA bunkers in in 99.
[01:23:55.817 --> 01:23:59.260]  And then to sell it to us, they called it the Amber Alert and funded it.
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.442]  And are now making it the law that they can take over whenever they want.
[01:24:02.462 --> 01:24:04.003]  Now I work in radio.
[01:24:04.063 --> 01:24:05.024]  This is a fact.
[01:24:05.444 --> 01:24:07.026]  But the average person goes, oh no!
[01:24:08.084 --> 01:24:09.584]  That was to save the little kids.
[01:24:09.604 --> 01:24:12.085]  Well, now they're flashing report guns on the billboards.
[01:24:12.145 --> 01:24:15.106]  Now they're saying report terrorists on the billboards.
[01:24:15.186 --> 01:24:17.746]  I have video of this in Police State 3, my new video.
[01:24:18.206 --> 01:24:19.507]  I've seen that here in Colorado.
[01:24:19.527 --> 01:24:20.487]  You're absolutely right.
[01:24:21.007 --> 01:24:22.007]  But see how they sell it.
[01:24:22.047 --> 01:24:28.389]  It's, oh, we're going to have checkpoints, thousands of them every week now around the country, federally funded, mandated.
[01:24:29.406 --> 01:24:34.069]  Oh, we're going to have hardened checkpoints built in, already starting in New York, Kansas, all over the place.
[01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:37.732]  Oh, we're going to pay for it with a toll on the roads.
[01:24:38.132 --> 01:24:39.493]  Oh, but it's to stop drunks.
[01:24:39.553 --> 01:24:41.134]  You're against drunks, aren't you?
[01:24:41.595 --> 01:24:51.862]  But part three of the plan says that the seatbelt initiative is an excuse to search your car for criminal prosecutions.
[01:24:52.602 --> 01:24:54.744]  So it's admitted what they're doing, sir.
[01:24:55.765 --> 01:24:57.046]  You know, it's unbelievable.
[01:24:58.086 --> 01:24:58.927]  The average American
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.021]  Apparently he doesn't know how to use a calculator.
[01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:05.564]  Uh, when you crunch numbers and you find out the truth, you know that they're lying to you about stuff like this.
[01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:08.025]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:25:08.206 --> 01:25:13.569]  Especially because, you know, the news about drunk driving and the other things is put across as being absolute fact.
[01:25:14.069 --> 01:25:17.211]  Nobody verifies this information, they just take it because they're all brainwashed.
[01:25:17.231 --> 01:25:19.073]  Well, look, it's called probable cause.
[01:25:19.133 --> 01:25:22.815]  If somebody's weaving down the road, if a cop sees somebody drinking a Miller Lite,
[01:25:24.329 --> 01:25:26.069]  Then pull them over, bust them, whatever.
[01:25:26.129 --> 01:25:27.250]  But don't stop me.
[01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:29.970]  I mean, I've been at a checkpoint where it takes an hour to get through it.
[01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:31.190]  Hour and a half.
[01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:32.811]  I-35 is shut down.
[01:25:32.851 --> 01:25:34.771]  There's troops with machine guns.
[01:25:34.851 --> 01:25:36.291]  Literal army out now.
[01:25:36.711 --> 01:25:38.151]  Helicopters flying around.
[01:25:38.211 --> 01:25:41.292]  This has nothing to do with drunks or seatbelts.
[01:25:42.132 --> 01:25:42.932]  I agree with you there.
[01:25:42.992 --> 01:25:43.872]  Oh, they admit it!
[01:25:43.932 --> 01:25:48.433]  Their own plan says that that's just the label to get you to accept it.
[01:25:49.473 --> 01:25:52.894]  The Supreme Court says we can have safety checkpoints.
[01:25:53.573 --> 01:25:55.014]  That doesn't violate the law.
[01:25:55.094 --> 01:25:56.375]  It's for safety.
[01:25:56.395 --> 01:26:00.457]  Hey Alex, I heard about your finger.
[01:26:00.497 --> 01:26:05.140]  I'm sorry to hear that that happened to you, but I had a little word for you from Romans 8 18.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:11.784]  I do not consider these present sufferings to be worth compared to the glory that will be revealed to us.
[01:26:11.844 --> 01:26:13.025]  So hang in there, buddy.
[01:26:13.185 --> 01:26:14.186]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:26:14.206 --> 01:26:15.006]  You're doing a great job.
[01:26:15.627 --> 01:26:15.907]  All right.
[01:26:15.927 --> 01:26:16.447]  Thanks a lot.
[01:26:16.467 --> 01:26:19.109]  Yeah, I almost cut my finger off last weekend and I mentioned it.
[01:26:20.069 --> 01:26:26.391]  Just so that people in Austin that knew about it, it's no big deal, wouldn't turn it into, I got cut in half by a dinosaur.
[01:26:26.411 --> 01:26:28.651]  You know how these stories morph and change.
[01:26:29.071 --> 01:26:30.592]  We'll be back with more calls in the news.
[01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:31.092]  Stay with me.
[01:26:32.712 --> 01:26:33.632]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.093 --> 01:26:35.753]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:35.813 --> 01:26:39.314]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.897 --> 01:26:48.400]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.823]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:26:53.103 --> 01:26:56.785]  We mark powerful black mercury replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:56.825 --> 01:26:57.106]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.062]  Folks, it's simple.
[01:27:16.162 --> 01:27:29.725]  The government isn't going to say, putting in a running man system where the billboards say, report terrorists, where the cameras watch you and face scan you, where the radio and TV stations get taken over every day for government broadcast.
[01:27:30.886 --> 01:27:33.746]  And so they go, there's an Amber Alert system.
[01:27:34.867 --> 01:27:36.347]  It's for the children.
[01:27:37.361 --> 01:27:39.482]  You're for the children, aren't you?
[01:27:40.102 --> 01:27:45.424]  When it's a public set system, years before they even put in the Amber Alert.
[01:27:45.705 --> 01:27:48.986]  Then Congress funds it, you read the bill, it's the EAS system.
[01:27:49.801 --> 01:27:53.803]  The FCC, under their laws, under their regulations, made the stations take it.
[01:27:54.123 --> 01:27:58.485]  Then it became the law that they had to let the government take over whenever and however they wanted.
[01:27:58.505 --> 01:28:00.745]  And now the billboard's in Texas.
[01:28:00.765 --> 01:28:05.407]  You know, when the state legislatures were in a fight, they used Homeland Security to go after the legislature.
[01:28:05.567 --> 01:28:07.288]  Source on that, Dallas Morning News.
[01:28:08.489 --> 01:28:10.329]  They flash report illegal guns.
[01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:14.471]  And they've got some now that are like Jumbotron TV screens.
[01:28:15.011 --> 01:28:16.612]  And they'll flash guns on them.
[01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:21.050]  I mean, it's just la-la land insanity, folks.
[01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:26.071]  You go rent the 1986 Running Man, and it's the same thing.
[01:28:26.091 --> 01:28:29.572]  I mean, it's as Orwellian as it gets, folks.
[01:28:29.832 --> 01:28:36.474]  And then you have arguments with idiots that go, oh, it's an amber alert, or at least checkpoints are to stop drunks.
[01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:42.895]  The government says they're to search your vehicle and set up internal passport checkpoint toll roads.
[01:28:43.095 --> 01:28:43.655]  Okay?
[01:28:43.975 --> 01:28:46.316]  Official government law.
[01:28:48.112 --> 01:28:48.832]  Look around you.
[01:28:48.852 --> 01:28:53.414]  They're putting in the infrastructure right now for the cashless society control grid.
[01:28:53.454 --> 01:29:00.476]  Tearing out the service checkout lines in Home Depot and at the malls and in the grocery stores.
[01:29:00.516 --> 01:29:04.017]  And then after they put in the self-serve, they put in thumb scanners.
[01:29:04.097 --> 01:29:07.598]  Then they get rid of the service checkout lines.
[01:29:07.638 --> 01:29:08.839]  Then you don't have a choice.
[01:29:09.099 --> 01:29:10.519]  Then you've got a thumb scan.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.000]  That destroys the economy.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.141]  This is all about control.
[01:29:17.721 --> 01:29:21.463]  Years ago I told you about the plan to make you retina scan to start your car.
[01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:22.844]  Official federal plan.
[01:29:23.364 --> 01:29:25.585]  Houston Chronicle reported on it two years ago.
[01:29:26.345 --> 01:29:28.326]  Now Australia's about to make it the law.
[01:29:29.086 --> 01:29:32.828]  A retina scanner in your car to make sure you're not tired or on drugs.
[01:29:33.128 --> 01:29:34.509]  It'll save lives!
[01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:40.712]  They say that 30 children die a year by being left in the car by their parents.
[01:29:41.463 --> 01:29:58.997]  And so the GM and Ford, by 2005, have had discussions of putting it standard on cars to have a wireless infrared camera, and that if the heat goes up to a certain point, it will register if you're in the car and have it disabled it, and will call the police.
[01:29:59.057 --> 01:30:00.999]  Why, it'll save 30 children!
[01:30:01.279 --> 01:30:07.524]  We need cameras watching us by cell phone, booked in to Homeland Security!
[01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:15.435]  And I've read Associated Press, World Net Daily, all the articles, BBC, from England to Australia to the U.S.
[01:30:15.455 --> 01:30:19.056]  They're about to make it the law to satellite track and tax you to drive your car.
[01:30:20.317 --> 01:30:21.577]  You know, this is all happening.
[01:30:21.617 --> 01:30:24.238]  San Francisco made you take transponders in your cars.
[01:30:24.898 --> 01:30:27.178]  And no more paying cash at the toll roads.
[01:30:28.519 --> 01:30:29.599]  And then they said, oh, guess what?
[01:30:29.619 --> 01:30:31.439]  We're going to turn a whole city into a toll road.
[01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:33.200]  We're putting the radio readers up.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.320]  And we're going to tax you and trace you as you drive.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.641]  Folks, it's already happening.
[01:30:39.102 --> 01:30:40.863]  It's all ready here!
[01:30:41.664 --> 01:30:43.445]  I have their official statements!
[01:30:45.887 --> 01:30:46.787]  And it makes me so mad.
[01:30:46.807 --> 01:30:48.568]  Let's take a few calls and then I gotta get to this news.
[01:30:48.869 --> 01:30:49.869]  I just gotta get to it.
[01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:52.011]  I'm going on these calls quick.
[01:30:52.071 --> 01:30:53.272]  Each caller's got about a minute and a half.
[01:30:54.192 --> 01:30:55.133]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:30:55.213 --> 01:30:56.654]  Ed, you're on the air, then Phil and Bart.
[01:30:56.694 --> 01:30:57.314]  Go ahead, Ed.
[01:30:57.654 --> 01:31:01.137]  Alex, I have the older Burkafield plastic water filter.
[01:31:01.997 --> 01:31:03.398]  It's got new filters in it.
[01:31:03.438 --> 01:31:04.339]  Works great.
[01:31:04.499 --> 01:31:07.261]  I was looking for a good excuse to get upgraded to this new one.
[01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:09.429]  The stand and the lights, you know?
[01:31:10.009 --> 01:31:10.349]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:10.749 --> 01:31:16.292]  And my buddy come over, and his brother's in Iraq, and their major complaint over there is the water.
[01:31:16.312 --> 01:31:19.293]  They can't drink the water because it's being treated so heavy, you know?
[01:31:19.713 --> 01:31:21.514]  Yeah, it's got so much chlorine and stuff in it.
[01:31:21.674 --> 01:31:23.215]  Yeah, well, I'm going to donate it.
[01:31:23.235 --> 01:31:24.435]  That's my excuse.
[01:31:24.635 --> 01:31:27.196]  And we're going to get by some sport bottles and send them over.
[01:31:27.216 --> 01:31:29.777]  I recommend it to anybody out there who's got any kids over there.
[01:31:29.797 --> 01:31:30.538]  You know, that's a good point.
[01:31:30.598 --> 01:31:33.039]  They won't even give our troops water filter systems.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.743]  Yeah, anybody got kids or relatives out there, buy them some sport bottles or buy them at Barkfield.
[01:31:37.763 --> 01:31:38.544]  Send it over to them.
[01:31:38.764 --> 01:31:44.688]  Yeah, the sports bottle will do like 400 gallons, cost, I don't know, $29.
[01:31:45.609 --> 01:31:48.831]  It'll clean the water to very clean levels.
[01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:49.752]  That's a great idea.
[01:31:49.772 --> 01:31:51.213]  Yeah, I thought it was.
[01:31:52.994 --> 01:31:53.655]  Them kids need it.
[01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:56.317]  Them guys over there, you know, I don't support the war, but, you know, we gotta help.
[01:31:58.286 --> 01:31:59.007]  Well, certainly.
[01:31:59.107 --> 01:32:01.348]  I mean, I support the troops.
[01:32:01.468 --> 01:32:05.029]  I didn't like them getting nerve gas in the first war and not getting treatment.
[01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:07.210]  That's incredible.
[01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:09.391]  But really supporting the troops is bad.
[01:32:09.431 --> 01:32:18.154]  You're supposed to just mindlessly, on a skin-deep level, wave plastic desecrated American flags made by slaves in China.
[01:32:19.695 --> 01:32:21.656]  Maybe I'll slip a couple of your tapes in the box, too.
[01:32:22.676 --> 01:32:23.096]  Sure.
[01:32:24.997 --> 01:32:26.198]  What else is on your mind, Ed?
[01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:38.496]  About 35 years ago, my dad seen a fishing, wildlife and fish guy with a big .357 Magnum on his side harassing people without a fishing license.
[01:32:39.096 --> 01:32:45.420]  Way back then, you know, guys from the World War II era, he was like, I was like a little kid, he goes, that's something wrong here.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.021]  He goes, that shouldn't be going on, you know.
[01:32:47.041 --> 01:32:48.002]  Let me tell you what happened.
[01:32:48.042 --> 01:32:50.203]  Two years ago, there was a Field and Stream article.
[01:32:50.223 --> 01:32:53.665]  I don't take Field and Stream, but a listener sent me the whole magazine.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:08.584]  The deputy editor was fishing with a license on a lake and they came up to the dock and a SWAT team, it said in black and green ski masks, came up and roughed them up.
[01:33:08.684 --> 01:33:11.865]  So see, the more that happens, the more people are going to get angry.
[01:33:13.685 --> 01:33:16.446]  Yeah, but my father was from Russia.
[01:33:17.526 --> 01:33:18.187]  Well, his parents and
[01:33:21.552 --> 01:33:24.273]  He always talked about how we were always going toward Russia.
[01:33:24.794 --> 01:33:26.474]  We were returning like that, you know?
[01:33:26.715 --> 01:33:36.319]  Anybody who's lived in tyranny in Poland or China or Russia is freaking out right now to see the exact slogans with just an added American flair.
[01:33:36.339 --> 01:33:37.019]  Thanks for the call.
[01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:37.559]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:33:37.759 --> 01:33:38.620]  Phil in Virginia.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.520]  Phil, you're on the air.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:39.960]  Go ahead.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.342]  Phil, it's good to talk to you.
[01:33:44.382 --> 01:33:44.743]  Go ahead.
[01:33:45.123 --> 01:33:47.404]  I have a little update and I have two brief questions.
[01:33:48.416 --> 01:34:15.071]  I spoke with the man today, the owner of the station that I'm trying to get you on here, and he wanted to... I asked him to listen to your program, the CD that Chris sent me, and he tried to denigrate the program, and then I called him on it and said, you know, this is a top-notch production, and then he relented and admitted that, and then I told him that
[01:34:16.075 --> 01:34:20.859]  This program is the most important program that he could have on the air.
[01:34:21.539 --> 01:34:22.720]  And why don't he run it?
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.543]  And he just continued to say that he didn't think it was proper for that time frame.
[01:34:27.003 --> 01:34:35.410]  And I said, the truth of the matter is, you could put the man's show on against Rush Limbaugh live and not miss a beat.
[01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.611]  And that's just that, you know.
[01:34:39.505 --> 01:34:40.006]  That's right.
[01:35:00.166 --> 01:35:07.355]  A lot of people think conservatism is Bush reauthorizing the assault weapons ban and adding a ban on all semi-automatic shotguns.
[01:35:07.415 --> 01:35:10.499]  They think I'm liberal because I'm against the assault weapons ban.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.144]  They think I'm liberal because I'm for controlling our borders.
[01:35:14.604 --> 01:35:17.428]  They think I'm liberal because I want to prosecute Bill Clinton.
[01:35:18.432 --> 01:35:22.015]  They think I'm liberal because I'm against giving supercomputers to Communist China.
[01:35:22.356 --> 01:35:27.060]  They think I'm liberal because I'm against campaign finance reform that restricts the First Amendment.
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:30.542]  They think I'm liberal because I'm against the New World Order.
[01:35:30.923 --> 01:35:39.510]  They think conservatism means that you're for more government, more regulation, no Bill of Rights, gun control, tripling the size of the BATF,
[01:35:40.537 --> 01:35:41.898]  Forced national service.
[01:35:42.378 --> 01:35:45.019]  They think that Lenin and Stalin are conservative.
[01:35:45.419 --> 01:35:49.860]  They think George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are liberal.
[01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:54.362]  And so they think that this is what they really think.
[01:35:54.422 --> 01:35:55.662]  This is what their views are.
[01:35:56.043 --> 01:35:58.063]  They're liberals and didn't even know it.
[01:35:58.764 --> 01:36:01.825]  Yeah, they're cult members and they don't even realize it.
[01:36:02.765 --> 01:36:03.425]  I have to agree.
[01:36:03.465 --> 01:36:05.286]  It's a cult of idiocy and mindlessness.
[01:36:06.426 --> 01:36:33.509]  and uh... and uh... so i mean that's to be expected so you know they believe the propaganda i mean i mean all the neocons do is bash mindless liberals and beat up stupid liberals on their shows and all they're doing is beating up somebody out of their own camp giving us the illusion that they're actually against all this and they're not they're the worst people out there the neocons are despicable creatures that's right
[01:36:34.227 --> 01:36:34.587]  Okay.
[01:36:34.807 --> 01:36:47.293]  Also, I try to get your videos on public access and run up against a stone wall on that also, because the government's involved with that.
[01:36:48.193 --> 01:36:50.755]  Look, any access station's going to tell you you can't put stuff on.
[01:36:51.235 --> 01:36:53.456]  You ask for their rules, and yes you can.
[01:36:53.856 --> 01:37:00.399]  You may have to go down and sign up and take some classes, so believe me, I know the rules on that.
[01:37:00.599 --> 01:37:01.319]  Is public TV
[01:37:03.069 --> 01:37:04.430]  Do they get any taxpayer money?
[01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:09.393]  Well, I mean, have you called Public Access, or did you call the... I've called both.
[01:37:09.733 --> 01:37:11.114]  Or did you call the local PBS?
[01:37:11.274 --> 01:37:13.536]  Well, PBS... I called a local PBS.
[01:37:13.636 --> 01:37:15.677]  PBS is Rockefeller TV, okay?
[01:37:15.977 --> 01:37:17.878]  And it's just phony left-wing stuff.
[01:37:18.579 --> 01:37:25.343]  And then, let me tell you, in 1974, there was an act of Congress
[01:37:26.787 --> 01:37:46.615]  That if cities were going to give cable systems monopoly of the right-of-way, which is worth tens of millions in major studies a year to them, that a small portion of the cable bill, which is paid for by cable subscribers, would go to carry city, county, school district, and to provide a local venue for citizens to engage in the First Amendment.
[01:37:47.333 --> 01:37:50.955]  In 1996, they deregulated that and said that you no longer had to do that.
[01:37:51.496 --> 01:37:52.916]  But it's still up to the cities.
[01:37:52.997 --> 01:37:56.919]  The cities can still force the cable companies to provide that and they should.
[01:37:57.599 --> 01:38:00.761]  In Austin, 31 cents out of the basic cable bill, $27,
[01:38:03.055 --> 01:38:11.041]  A little over 30 cents goes to provide city, county, school, so you can see what's happening there, and a local venue for people to get on TV.
[01:38:11.441 --> 01:38:19.527]  I think it's wonderful, it's what the airwaves are all about, but this isn't the airwaves, this is transmission lines, and so now they're claiming that it's been deregulated.
[01:38:19.828 --> 01:38:24.231]  But it doesn't matter, if your city forces them, they will go along with AXS TV.
[01:38:25.374 --> 01:38:34.522]  And also, they're now promoting AXS TV if it's an establishment version because it's a value-added caveat to original programming that cannot be offered on the satellite.
[01:38:34.943 --> 01:38:35.603]  How about that?
[01:38:36.004 --> 01:38:36.344]  Okay.
[01:38:37.085 --> 01:38:41.549]  Do you have any inside information that I need to know about the Green Party and the JBS?
[01:38:42.836 --> 01:38:45.360]  The Green Party has a lot of good, well-meaning people in it.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.286]  It is establishment run by the big foundations and is basically a watermelon.
[01:38:49.326 --> 01:38:51.108]  Green on the outside, red on the inside.
[01:38:51.369 --> 01:38:52.050]  Okay.
[01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:56.196]  The JBS has a lot of good members and puts out a lot of good information and I think they're solid.
[01:38:56.236 --> 01:38:56.777]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:57.421 --> 01:38:57.902]  Appreciate it.
[01:38:58.002 --> 01:38:59.904]  One more call and I gotta get to news real quick.
[01:39:00.244 --> 01:39:01.005]  Barton, Texas.
[01:39:01.025 --> 01:39:01.565]  You're on the air.
[01:39:01.585 --> 01:39:02.206]  Go ahead, Bart.
[01:39:02.466 --> 01:39:02.987]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:03.067 --> 01:39:10.234]  I just basically called in to talk a little bit about how disgusting it is, the swill and the doublethink that comes out of our TV these days.
[01:39:10.474 --> 01:39:14.218]  You know, I have the day off today, so I decided to turn on the TV and see what was on.
[01:39:15.179 --> 01:39:17.201]  And I didn't know this, but basically, you know, here
[01:39:17.981 --> 01:39:24.144]  They got about three hours in the afternoon dedicated to these judge shows, where you get some poor, you know, ignorant fool.
[01:39:24.164 --> 01:39:28.346]  It's training you for the tribunal for the judge system, yes.
[01:39:28.906 --> 01:39:45.153]  Yeah, I mean, it's just between that and a lot of the double think that goes on, like the other day, I don't know if you caught this, the Fox was running a special on the BBC, basically because the BBC ran an airing of a show where they went around the world and polled people about, you know,
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:50.141]  Issues of the day concerning America and, you know, our stance towards the rest of the world.
[01:39:50.561 --> 01:39:52.662]  And in it, America's bad, but the U.N.
[01:39:52.702 --> 01:39:53.222]  is good.
[01:39:53.242 --> 01:39:56.363]  Two sides of the same coin, paradigm management.
[01:39:56.643 --> 01:40:06.985]  Yeah, I mean, I just, I just, well, I mean, just people in the audience, you know, I just, I don't understand, I really can't understand the zombie mentality that's going on with most of, most of, you know, our citizens.
[01:40:07.005 --> 01:40:15.067]  Well, people can, can, can, can analyze football and baseball and know all the details, but they don't think they can understand politics, so they just buy the surface projection.
[01:40:15.717 --> 01:40:17.198]  We've got to get them beneath the surface.
[01:40:18.699 --> 01:40:23.743]  Yeah, it's pretty sad at how willing people are just to be spoon-fed all their information.
[01:40:24.623 --> 01:40:25.864]  I hear you Bart, thanks for the call.
[01:40:25.884 --> 01:40:28.106]  Alright, let me cover some news now.
[01:40:29.166 --> 01:40:35.651]  Now, bottom line, the 83 test of Prozac found that a large percent
[01:40:36.603 --> 01:40:44.491]  In one of the studies by the drug maker, 14% had psychotic breaks or had violent behavior.
[01:40:44.511 --> 01:40:46.273]  A large percent committed suicide.
[01:40:48.255 --> 01:40:51.559]  And it puts you into a mind-numbed system.
[01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:53.641]  It mesmerizes you.
[01:40:53.701 --> 01:40:55.323]  It puts you in a subconscious state.
[01:40:56.304 --> 01:40:56.884]  This is admitted.
[01:40:56.944 --> 01:40:59.547]  It's a psychotropic akin to a hallucinogen.
[01:41:00.598 --> 01:41:03.379]  And the FDA Paxil may be linked to suicide in kids.
[01:41:03.399 --> 01:41:06.359]  The agency warns that kids shouldn't suddenly stop medication.
[01:41:07.039 --> 01:41:07.839]  So that's the spin.
[01:41:07.879 --> 01:41:09.260]  If you've been on it, go off of it slowly.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.040]  And that is true.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.020]  But getting on it also causes it.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.541]  The Food and Drug Administration wants doctors to stop giving the antidepressant Paxil to children.
[01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:24.582]  The agency is viewing reports that the drug may increase a child's risk of suicidal thinking and suicide attempts.
[01:41:24.602 --> 01:41:25.943]  Well, the whole class of drugs does it.
[01:41:26.223 --> 01:41:27.203]  And same thing with adults.
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:31.581]  The added hormones in an adolescent even make it worse.
[01:41:32.121 --> 01:41:35.662]  But health officials said children and teens now taking Paxil should not stop immediately.
[01:41:36.022 --> 01:41:36.342]  I agree.
[01:41:37.142 --> 01:41:45.223]  Those who do not stop taking Paxil will need medical supervision to taper off and avoid rebound side effects, which include abnormal dreams and shock-like sensations.
[01:41:45.864 --> 01:41:52.405]  Well, yeah, and the insert for these class of drugs, unconsciousness, seizures, you know, I mean, give me a break, folks.
[01:41:53.528 --> 01:41:54.689]  It changes brain chemistry.
[01:41:54.729 --> 01:41:57.311]  The FDA has never approved the use of Paxilin on children or teens.
[01:41:57.671 --> 01:42:02.874]  The agency says there's no evidence that the drug is effective in treating major depressive disorders in kids.
[01:42:02.894 --> 01:42:06.617]  The agency's warning does not forbid doctors from prescribing the drug to anyone under 18.
[01:42:06.677 --> 01:42:11.460]  They've been doing it, and CPS will put your kids on it first thing when they get them, because they get federal fines.
[01:42:13.141 --> 01:42:22.767]  Folks, every shooter, Harris, Kleibold, Kinkle, all of them, every case, Ashbrook at the Baptist Church, Furrow at the Jewish Temple,
[01:42:24.065 --> 01:42:27.107]  Every mass shooter we've seen has been on these drugs.
[01:42:28.107 --> 01:42:31.669]  I mean, there's been cases of women on it, dancing around naked on roofs.
[01:42:32.849 --> 01:42:33.389]  It's horrible.
[01:42:35.951 --> 01:42:37.171]  And what does Ritalin do?
[01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:38.852]  It's methamphetamine, folks.
[01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:47.616]  Retards growth, brain shrinkage, brain damage, heart palpitations, increased heart size and double in size.
[01:42:48.276 --> 01:42:51.418]  University study, Ritalin use may worsen cocaine abuse.
[01:42:52.344 --> 01:42:59.068]  People who use cocaine regularly may have a harder time breaking the habit if they use Ritalin or the club drug Ecstasy in their youth.
[01:42:59.448 --> 01:43:01.449]  University of Miami studies suggest the number of U.S.
[01:43:01.489 --> 01:43:08.773]  children, adolescents who are prescribed Ritalin and other stimulants surged dramatically in the 1990s from 1 million to over 10 million, I would add.
[01:43:09.488 --> 01:43:20.011]  The study conducted on laboratory mice found that rodents given Ritalin and Ecstasy, then later cocaine, showed higher sensitivity to cocaine than those that hadn't been exposed to the first two stimulants.
[01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:20.512]  Well, yeah.
[01:43:21.032 --> 01:43:23.893]  You get somebody on methamphetamine, they're going to like other narcotics.
[01:43:24.833 --> 01:43:27.414]  If they start using drugs, these guys have been
[01:43:28.194 --> 01:43:29.914]  Folks, it blocks neuroreceptors.
[01:43:29.934 --> 01:43:32.395]  You cannot be a happy person the level you could.
[01:43:32.555 --> 01:43:34.036]  They develop more depression.
[01:43:34.176 --> 01:43:35.916]  You get natural endorphins.
[01:43:35.996 --> 01:43:38.637]  I got endorphins flowing right now on this show.
[01:43:38.717 --> 01:43:44.058]  I'm on the radio talking to millions of people.
[01:43:55.379 --> 01:43:58.902]  When I do a good job or when I make a good film, I get high.
[01:43:59.703 --> 01:44:01.684]  God designed it that way and it's real.
[01:44:02.085 --> 01:44:03.346]  And it opens receptors.
[01:44:03.386 --> 01:44:04.747]  It doesn't block receptors.
[01:44:05.287 --> 01:44:10.451]  I am on natural narcotics 18 hours a day!
[01:44:10.471 --> 01:44:14.675]  I remember when I was a linebacker, man, I'd stick somebody.
[01:44:15.956 --> 01:44:18.158]  And, you know, it's a war simulation.
[01:44:19.179 --> 01:44:21.280]  And, you know, the guy had to carry the guy off the field.
[01:44:21.761 --> 01:44:23.142]  I'd have an endorphin rush.
[01:44:24.474 --> 01:44:26.735]  Well, that's what endorphin is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:27.695 --> 01:44:30.977]  And, um... They're just ruining your kids' gray matter.
[01:44:30.997 --> 01:44:36.379]  Ah, go ahead, give them hallucinogens, psychotropics, give them narcotics.
[01:44:37.759 --> 01:44:39.220]  Give them amphetamines.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.981]  Let them shrink their brains.
[01:44:41.021 --> 01:44:42.481]  Let their hearts palpitate.
[01:44:43.362 --> 01:44:45.042]  Let your child never grow.
[01:44:45.203 --> 01:44:46.163]  Stunt their growth.
[01:44:46.923 --> 01:44:48.544]  Speed kills, baby.
[01:44:50.085 --> 01:44:52.686]  Big Pharma says they want to put all the troops on it now.
[01:44:52.926 --> 01:44:53.506]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:54.594 --> 01:44:56.675]  Then they'll come back and be hopped up cops.
[01:44:57.775 --> 01:44:59.456]  I'll tell you about the spread of paganism.
[01:45:00.056 --> 01:45:01.457]  It's admitted, thanks to Harry Potter.
[01:45:01.497 --> 01:45:02.077]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:03.437 --> 01:45:07.779]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:45:07.939 --> 01:45:12.381]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:45:12.521 --> 01:45:16.902]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:45:16.962 --> 01:45:18.283]  The New World Order.
[01:45:20.072 --> 01:45:24.295]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:45:24.355 --> 01:45:31.280]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:33.502]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:45:33.682 --> 01:45:44.230]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:45.691]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:45:45.731 --> 01:45:46.031]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:04.207 --> 01:46:08.712]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:09.032 --> 01:46:13.136]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:13.436 --> 01:46:13.977]  We listened.
[01:46:14.297 --> 01:46:19.262]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:20.023]  We listened.
[01:46:20.423 --> 01:46:23.446]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:23.887 --> 01:46:24.427]  We listened.
[01:46:24.888 --> 01:46:28.251]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:46:28.271 --> 01:46:28.831]  We're good to go.

[01:48:08.392 --> 01:48:10.313]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:48:10.793 --> 01:48:13.534]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:33.815]  The point I'm making is, they're trying to destroy humanity, get us dependent on drugs, they've been shipping the narcotics in for a long time, they sell us the alcohol, they sell us all these other drugs, and now they're moving on to narcotics and hallucinogens, the psychotropics.
[01:48:35.155 --> 01:48:37.716]  And it goes on that
[01:48:38.974 --> 01:48:47.278]  If they start using drugs, these guys that have been predisposed to Ritalin and Ecstasy may be more susceptible for relapse than others.
[01:48:48.218 --> 01:48:52.040]  Higher doses may be much more dangerous than therapeutic doses, he said.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:59.483]  Adding that the study may be more relevant to those who abuse Ritalin than those who take it carefully monitored prescription basis.
[01:48:59.523 --> 01:49:00.084]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:00.564 --> 01:49:02.325]  For Ritalin, caution should be used.
[01:49:02.365 --> 01:49:05.426]  For Ecstasy, using adolescence, it's a warning signal.
[01:49:06.697 --> 01:49:11.001]  Well, drug abuse explodes when your kids have ever been on Ritalin or any of these other drugs.
[01:49:12.101 --> 01:49:14.623]  The narcotics speeds or the psychotropics.
[01:49:15.604 --> 01:49:27.933]  And the professor says that adolescents will present the results on Wednesday, which he did in Ball Harbor during the 65th Annual Meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, a national group of more than 1,000 scientists.
[01:49:29.346 --> 01:49:35.348]  Ritalin is a stimulant used to treat millions of children and adults diagnosed with ADHD, a made-up thing.
[01:49:36.008 --> 01:49:52.233]  Again, when you get a puppy and it jumps around and chews on things, or you see a baby seal on Discovery Channel hopping around happily, the doctors descend on it and put it on Ritalin to burn its little brain out?
[01:49:52.293 --> 01:49:53.673]  No, this is what mammals do.
[01:49:53.733 --> 01:49:55.874]  This is how you behave.
[01:49:55.914 --> 01:49:57.394]  This is how you're supposed to act.
[01:49:58.894 --> 01:50:01.857]  That boy's raising his hand too much and talking in class.
[01:50:02.237 --> 01:50:02.958]  Can you believe it?
[01:50:02.998 --> 01:50:04.719]  Let's put him on narcotics!
[01:50:06.841 --> 01:50:13.027]  In the 1990s, prescriptions for Ritalin and similar drugs rose five-fold nearly 20 million by 2000.
[01:50:13.747 --> 01:50:19.673]  Well, my number from 6 to 10 million individuals taking it any one year, they say 20 million.
[01:50:19.753 --> 01:50:20.033]  Okay.
[01:50:20.916 --> 01:50:29.060]  According to IMS Health, a national prescription auditing firm, about 80% of the prescriptions were written for children diagnosed with ADHD.
[01:50:30.501 --> 01:50:32.382]  My son got in a fist fight, they say.
[01:50:32.402 --> 01:50:34.283]  I remember kids in school getting in a fight or something.
[01:50:34.303 --> 01:50:36.484]  They'd be on a red line the next week, drooling in the corner.
[01:50:38.032 --> 01:50:39.033]  Changes in the brain!
[01:50:39.093 --> 01:50:41.954]  The professor said that it changes brain chemistry.
[01:50:42.014 --> 01:50:44.416]  And it causes heart palpitations, brain damage.
[01:50:44.796 --> 01:50:46.597]  The size of the brain actually shrinks.
[01:50:46.777 --> 01:50:48.938]  Oh, that's a nice thing to do to your child.
[01:50:49.219 --> 01:50:51.000]  But the doctor said it was okay.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.984]  Yeah, a doctor bought and paid for by the military-industrial complex, who's probably hopped up on more drugs than you can count on two hands.
[01:50:59.324 --> 01:51:00.725]  Bunch of drug addict idiots.
[01:51:02.946 --> 01:51:04.748]  I'll tell you folks, this is disgusting.
[01:51:06.088 --> 01:51:07.189]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:51:08.203 --> 01:51:13.207]  Alright, Paganism, Witchcraft on the Rise in the UK, TV Shows, Internet, Harry Potter, Boost, Membership.
[01:51:13.628 --> 01:51:14.328]  It's official.
[01:51:14.348 --> 01:51:20.674]  The biggest religion now in England is Paganism, and when they poll people, they say, oh, I got into it because of Harry Potter.
[01:51:20.754 --> 01:51:24.837]  I got into it because of... Harry Potter is a handbook on witchcraft, okay?
[01:51:25.177 --> 01:51:26.258]  I've studied witchcraft.
[01:51:26.378 --> 01:51:27.579]  It gets kids into it.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.261]  You can keep denying it.
[01:51:29.281 --> 01:51:31.543]  The Christian schools have it as curriculum now.
[01:51:31.843 --> 01:51:35.326]  The same Christian schools that have pictures of George Bush hanging up.
[01:51:36.887 --> 01:51:39.749]  And they're just replacing Christianity with Paganism.
[01:51:39.789 --> 01:51:41.490]  That's what's happening, let's be honest.
[01:51:41.630 --> 01:51:50.476]  More of that coming up in the next hour, plus I've got folks coming on to talk about Walmart and Homeland Security and the RFID tags and more of your calls.
[01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:51.597]  But before I end this hour,
[01:51:52.501 --> 01:51:56.382]  I hope everybody goes to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:56.862 --> 01:51:58.543]  I hope you order all my videos.

[01:52:00.564 --> 01:52:05.245]  I've made nine different films and the newest one is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:05.265 --> 01:52:12.567]  They're incredible videos dissecting the New World Order, covering Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, government-sponsored terror.

[01:52:48.731 --> 01:52:51.333]  Don't be the one that laid down and let the globalists win.
[01:52:51.433 --> 01:52:52.253]  Stand up and join us.
[01:52:52.273 --> 01:52:52.934]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:53.554 --> 01:52:59.738]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:53:00.438 --> 01:53:04.241]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most
[01:53:08.593 --> 01:53:11.815]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.399 --> 01:53:20.040]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.841]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.481 --> 01:53:23.622]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.642 --> 01:53:25.083]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.803 --> 01:53:26.764]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.364 --> 01:53:31.226]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.546 --> 01:53:35.649]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.816 --> 01:53:39.637]  We've got Catherine Albrecht.
[01:53:39.657 --> 01:53:47.522]  She is the founder and director of Caspian, Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion.
[01:53:49.424 --> 01:53:54.267]  Joining us in the next segment, and we've got a bunch of other news, and I'll be getting to it, of course, your calls.
[01:53:55.147 --> 01:54:03.553]  I want to talk about Walmart, the RFID tracker chips developed by the Office of Naval Intelligence, hooked in with Homeland Security for the Total Tracking Grid.
[01:54:04.184 --> 01:54:08.006]  All right, now let's go to Dick and Willie and Jason and others.
[01:54:08.426 --> 01:54:09.987]  Dick in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:54:10.027 --> 01:54:10.487]  Go ahead.
[01:54:10.507 --> 01:54:12.448]  Hello, Alex?
[01:54:12.808 --> 01:54:13.308]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:13.929 --> 01:54:20.712]  Yeah, I was wondering, Alex, what do you know about Ted Gunderson?
[01:54:22.093 --> 01:54:25.334]  Is he up and up on everything?
[01:54:26.054 --> 01:54:33.218]  You know, there's a sport of analyzing people in the Patriot Movement, and that's about all people in the Patriot Movement do.
[01:54:34.361 --> 01:54:43.373]  I've had Ted on, and he's brought forward some good information, and I know that there's been controversy surrounding him, but I found a lot of what he has to say to be accurate.
[01:54:43.574 --> 01:54:46.658]  I don't know about all of it, and I really don't engage in it.
[01:54:48.143 --> 01:54:51.745]  I just wanted because I've been putting all your videos I've been playing on AXS TV and I haven't got real good responses.
[01:55:18.646 --> 01:55:20.608]  A lot of people calling and wanting to know more.
[01:55:21.769 --> 01:55:23.991]  Did you say you've gotten a good response or a bad response?
[01:55:24.191 --> 01:55:25.452]  Oh, a good response.
[01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:29.235]  Well, I appreciate you airing those, Dick.
[01:55:29.275 --> 01:55:30.096]  I hope you keep it up.
[01:55:30.476 --> 01:55:32.318]  Yeah, well, we've been doing it for a year now.
[01:55:33.699 --> 01:55:34.920]  New York's in text mode.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.041]  We've been putting them all on.
[01:55:36.061 --> 01:55:40.045]  Well, I want to commend you, sir.
[01:55:41.686 --> 01:55:42.206]  Okay, well, I...
[01:55:43.342 --> 01:55:44.603]  Just wondered about Ted.
[01:55:44.863 --> 01:55:48.705]  He wrote to me and he called me and he wanted me to get his video on tape too.
[01:55:50.085 --> 01:55:51.686]  Well, how did he find out about you?
[01:55:52.726 --> 01:55:56.908]  Well, I ordered one of his tapes, uh, Conspiracy of Silence.
[01:55:58.889 --> 01:56:01.571]  A very good video about how they're kidnapping these children.
[01:56:01.891 --> 01:56:04.432]  Yeah, well that's confirmed with the finder's case.
[01:56:04.452 --> 01:56:06.453]  Colonel Roberts has investigated that, yeah.
[01:56:07.133 --> 01:56:08.514]  Okay, well that's good news.
[01:56:09.034 --> 01:56:10.915]  Alright, I appreciate the call.
[01:56:11.901 --> 01:56:14.102]  I really appreciate you, Dick.
[01:56:15.022 --> 01:56:17.003]  Willie in Alabama, you're on the air.
[01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:17.583]  Go ahead.
[01:56:18.043 --> 01:56:18.984]  Greetings, Mr. Jones.
[01:56:19.204 --> 01:56:19.764]  Greetings.
[01:56:19.844 --> 01:56:32.108]  Just wanted to know, I don't know if you've put this out on the air or not, about Harry Potter and the classes, the witchcraft classes that are going on tonight from 9 to midnight and also in the morning from 9 to 2 p.m.
[01:56:32.388 --> 01:56:33.549]  at all their stores.
[01:56:35.009 --> 01:56:37.490]  Yeah, the books are a handbook.
[01:56:37.530 --> 01:56:38.951]  They get darker in each book.
[01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:39.811]  I've read two of them now.
[01:56:40.641 --> 01:56:50.470]  And it is to get you into the occult, and MSNBC, the British government admits it, now the number one religion over there, and it's getting the kids into the occult, and this is what it's all about.
[01:56:50.490 --> 01:57:06.265]  Well, they actually got the classes tonight, and I know I'm going over to one of the stores tonight, and I hope and pray that other people across the nation will go and expose this satanic lie, and maybe books a million will get the message.
[01:57:07.219 --> 01:57:34.471]  Absolutely, and you see the differences between something like the Lord of the Rings, which is obviously has occult ramifications, is its analogy, and Tolkien was a Christian studier of medieval writings and was, you know, the all-seeing eye of Lucifer is a symbol of Sauron and all this, and that's dangerous enough, but something written for kids that teaches them how to carry out witchcraft, how to be empowered by witchcraft, it is a manual into the underworld, and it will destroy their lives.
[01:57:34.592 --> 01:57:35.292]  Very dangerous.
[01:57:35.672 --> 01:57:36.573]  Well, they've got teachers.
[01:57:36.593 --> 01:57:39.654]  They're going to have people there tonight that's going to give a course for the children.
[01:57:39.674 --> 01:57:44.076]  The public schools pay to have the kids in almost every elementary school taken to see Harry Potter films.
[01:57:44.797 --> 01:57:45.857]  The government's behind it.
[01:57:46.778 --> 01:57:47.238]  Pretty sick.
[01:57:47.938 --> 01:57:49.239]  Yeah, I saw those reports.
[01:57:49.279 --> 01:57:52.981]  They're going to have witchcraft classes at the major bookstores tonight, yeah.
[01:57:54.942 --> 01:57:56.623]  A great gathering point for everyone.
[01:57:58.924 --> 01:57:59.824]  Anything else, sir?
[01:58:00.145 --> 01:58:00.705]  No, that's all.
[01:58:00.725 --> 01:58:02.005]  Just thanks for all your work, sir.
[01:58:02.326 --> 01:58:02.666]  Thank you.
[01:58:04.133 --> 01:58:05.335]  You can't ignore the facts.
[01:58:05.435 --> 01:58:11.766]  It's now the biggest religion in Europe, in England, and human sacrifices and murder of animals is exploding.
[01:58:12.547 --> 01:58:13.449]  Just watch your animals.
[01:58:16.568 --> 01:58:20.192]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:58:20.352 --> 01:58:24.736]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:58:24.936 --> 01:58:29.400]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:32.563]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.

[01:58:41.871 --> 01:58:44.253]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:58:44.553 --> 01:58:48.436]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:58:48.676 --> 01:58:53.860]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:58:54.081 --> 01:58:57.023]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:58:57.183 --> 01:58:59.044]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.

[01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:09.652]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:59:09.672 --> 01:59:22.159]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:22.419 --> 01:59:27.162]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:27.382 --> 01:59:33.026]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:33.266 --> 01:59:37.787]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:38.007 --> 01:59:45.150]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:45.970]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:49.731]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:49.891 --> 01:59:52.392]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:59:52.612 --> 01:59:59.334]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:59:59.574 --> 02:00:04.838]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[02:00:13.487 --> 02:00:15.129]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.469 --> 02:00:21.195]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:00:21.456 --> 02:00:26.581]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:00:26.942 --> 02:00:34.650]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-2
[02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:35.210]  We're good to go.
[02:00:51.167 --> 02:00:57.150]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:00:57.430 --> 02:01:06.474]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:01:07.694 --> 02:01:08.715]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:15.686 --> 02:01:17.868]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:17.888 --> 02:01:21.290]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:26.293 --> 02:01:28.815]  Already into the third and final hour.
[02:01:28.995 --> 02:01:32.777]  Eight minutes into the third and final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:32.857 --> 02:01:33.938]  It's real talk radio.
[02:01:33.978 --> 02:01:37.180]  We talk about issues that actually affect you and your family.
[02:01:38.121 --> 02:01:41.002]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:01:42.412 --> 02:01:49.839]  Then back from 9 to midnight central, the websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:51.661 --> 02:02:03.912]  Now about a year ago there was a USA Today article about how half of Walmart products by this year, it's what they had said, were going to have these tiny RFID tracker chips in them, developed by the Office of Naval Intelligence.
[02:02:04.907 --> 02:02:07.269]  Hitachi manufactures them along with many others.
[02:02:07.509 --> 02:02:09.351]  They're now going to be in all the Gillette products.
[02:02:09.451 --> 02:02:09.812]  Target.
[02:02:09.832 --> 02:02:10.712]  Everybody's going to carry them.
[02:02:10.732 --> 02:02:11.733]  Procter & Gamble.
[02:02:12.214 --> 02:02:13.355]  The list goes on and on.
[02:02:16.002 --> 02:02:18.703]  And they want to track and trace you as you drive around town.
[02:02:19.204 --> 02:02:36.952]  Now, the article said that, and now in San Francisco, last week, last Monday, the San Mato Times reported that now the whole city is going to be a tollway, they've got radio readers on the roads, your individual transponder in your car, by law, they're going to track and trace you with it.
[02:02:36.992 --> 02:02:39.554]  So this is the plan with these systems.
[02:02:41.034 --> 02:02:41.995]  About two weeks ago,
[02:02:43.229 --> 02:02:55.411]  I was on a radio show that I've been on several times in the hometown of Walmart up in Arkansas and on the Frank Whalen Show and one of his listeners inside Walmart had faxed him
[02:02:56.258 --> 02:02:57.099]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:02:57.119 --> 02:03:08.128]  20-something pages of internal, not for distribution, it said the operative word was confidential information about their RFID system.
[02:03:08.168 --> 02:03:10.951]  They've got like a bunker bill for national tracking.
[02:03:11.111 --> 02:03:12.912]  All the Walmart stores are run by it.
[02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:18.077]  And it mentions the toll road capacity for it in one of the pages.
[02:03:18.898 --> 02:03:20.579]  And how Walmart, who has 33% of all retail sales,
[02:03:23.716 --> 02:03:28.239]  If they say that they want it in all the products, then all the manufacturers have to put it in standard.
[02:03:29.299 --> 02:03:29.639]  OK?
[02:03:29.659 --> 02:03:32.601]  If they're going to sell through Walmart, that causes the whole industry to do this.
[02:03:32.661 --> 02:03:38.604]  And there was actually an article in CNET News last week, I kept pointing this out, that would cause the whole industry to do this.
[02:03:38.985 --> 02:03:51.071]  CNET News said, yeah, Walmart gets behind RFID, and says by Walmart doing this with 33% now of total retail sales of all products, this will cause everybody to have to do this.
[02:03:52.717 --> 02:04:01.440]  Then I was also told by his sources inside Walmart that they are hooked into Homeland Security, that FBI is inside the infrastructure system.
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:02.981]  Well, this has already been announced.
[02:04:03.061 --> 02:04:20.827]  I have read you on tape on C-SPAN last year, early 2000, at a Homeland Security meeting before it was even funded, saying infrastructure protection means troops in all the bridges, the roads, the major factories, power plants, major distribution centers.
[02:04:22.379 --> 02:04:23.004]  This is it.
[02:04:23.327 --> 02:04:23.892]  And, uh...
[02:04:25.123 --> 02:04:28.105]  Catherine Albrecht, if I'm pronouncing that right, we've had her on before.
[02:04:28.346 --> 02:04:30.087]  Albrecht has been on the show.
[02:04:30.788 --> 02:04:52.145]  Catherine Albrecht is the founder and director of Caspian, Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion, and she got into this years ago over the fact that Kroger's and many other big chains, Safeway, sell the information, upload the data to the federal government of what you buy, they sell it to junk mailers, they use it in a whole host of issues,
[02:04:52.805 --> 02:04:53.306]  We're good to go.
[02:05:15.164 --> 02:05:18.266]  And Catherine, it's good to have you on the show.
[02:05:18.507 --> 02:05:20.668]  Hey Alex, you've been doing great work.
[02:05:21.008 --> 02:05:22.129]  And am I pronouncing your name right?
[02:05:22.169 --> 02:05:23.350]  It's Albrecht.
[02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:26.832]  It's A-L-B-R-E-C-H-T with a silent H. Albrecht.
[02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:27.993]  Albrecht.
[02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:29.774]  I'm public school educated.
[02:05:29.794 --> 02:05:30.235]  I have trouble.
[02:05:30.275 --> 02:05:30.775]  Nice name.
[02:05:31.075 --> 02:05:38.060]  I've had you on before and I'm sitting here in my office with a stack of about, in the last two weeks, 800 articles.
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:39.141]  I've been digging through them.
[02:05:39.201 --> 02:05:40.522]  I have the faxes right here.
[02:05:40.622 --> 02:05:42.103]  I'll give you the number to Frank Whalen.
[02:05:42.503 --> 02:05:43.904]  I keep saying I'll put them on the net.
[02:05:44.957 --> 02:05:45.618]  And I'll get to that.
[02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:46.798]  It'll just take hours to do it.
[02:05:46.818 --> 02:05:47.579]  We've been overwhelmed.
[02:05:47.619 --> 02:05:53.863]  But basically, what's in these documents has already been said publicly, but I'm sure Frank will fax them to you, or we will.
[02:05:53.923 --> 02:05:57.905]  But you have some of your own information on the RFID in Walmart.
[02:05:58.566 --> 02:06:06.690]  Well, I just got back from spending three days in Chicago last week at probably the world's first annual RFID adoption conference.
[02:06:06.951 --> 02:06:11.413]  And this coincided, it was in Chicago, coincided with the annual retailer conference there.
[02:06:11.854 --> 02:06:14.095]  Tell us what RFID is for those who don't know.
[02:06:14.235 --> 02:06:17.717]  Well, RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification.
[02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:25.561]  They are tiny computer chips the size of a speck of dust or a piece of sand surrounded by an antenna, usually about postage stamp size.
[02:06:25.601 --> 02:06:29.663]  Sometimes they can be as big as an index card or even a sheet of paper when you put the antenna on them.
[02:06:30.383 --> 02:06:31.864]  I read an article about Hitachi.
[02:06:31.904 --> 02:06:34.286]  They've got a chip half the size of a grain of sand.
[02:06:51.986 --> 02:06:52.266]  I think so.
[02:07:13.903 --> 02:07:20.465]  Let me kind of explain what it is and then we can get into some of the details of how the technology affects it.
[02:07:22.166 --> 02:07:33.569]  The creators of this technology, this actually got its jump start in 1999 when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Procter & Gamble got together and formed something called the Auto ID Center.
[02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:36.210]  You can find them online at autoidcenter.org.
[02:07:36.810 --> 02:07:38.811]  Auto standing for automatic, not automobile.
[02:07:39.286 --> 02:07:48.071]  The Auto-ID Center now has over 90 worldwide sponsors, some of the largest consumer product manufacturing companies in the world, the Department of Defense, the U.S.
[02:07:48.111 --> 02:07:55.875]  Postal Service, UPS, Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris, Johnson & Johnson.
[02:07:55.915 --> 02:07:56.836]  Big, big companies.
[02:07:56.876 --> 02:07:57.696]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:57.736 --> 02:08:08.242]  So, most of the stuff that we buy as consumers are somehow kind of floating around being involved in this, whether they've donated money directly or not, or are sponsors or not.
[02:08:08.682 --> 02:08:16.585]  Now, what happened in 1999, they decided to take this technology which had been around for a while for military and other applications and go commercial with it.
[02:08:17.086 --> 02:08:22.968]  And the ultimate goal of these chips is that they ultimately are supposed to replace the barcode.
[02:08:23.559 --> 02:08:26.040]  Now, unlike a barcode, let's talk about a barcode for a minute.
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:28.222]  The barcode was introduced in 1973.
[02:08:28.942 --> 02:08:38.827]  It did not gain wide adoption until Walmart, once again, actually pushed in the 1980s for its suppliers to adopt it, and Walmart was the 800-pound gorilla even back 20 years ago.
[02:08:38.847 --> 02:08:43.750]  Now, again, to explain this, by saying that anybody who sells to us has to have this,
[02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:47.652]  That changes the system-wide shift over to the tracking shift.
[02:08:47.672 --> 02:08:58.056]  You've got it, because what you do is you say to, you know, somebody selling one brand of crackers, you know, hey, you either get this barcode on your box or we're going to switch to your competitor who will get the barcode on their box.
[02:08:58.096 --> 02:09:04.439]  And so the retailers now can drive what the manufacturers are doing, and that's what Walmart's up to today.
[02:09:04.879 --> 02:09:12.063]  So the background on the barcode is that Walmart played a very key instrumental role in getting barcodes on all products around the 1980s.
[02:09:13.363 --> 02:09:19.145]  It's now that we've had the barcode around for about 30 years, they're now ready to move us to the next step of this.
[02:09:19.265 --> 02:09:20.946]  And the next step is this tiny chip.
[02:09:20.986 --> 02:09:23.307]  Now let me explain how the chip is different from a barcode.
[02:09:23.967 --> 02:09:32.550]  Unlike a barcode where your can of Coke and my can of Coke contain the exact same serial number, it's called a UPC or Universal Product Code number,
[02:09:33.170 --> 02:09:35.491]  Right now, Arkans and Koch have the same number on them.
[02:09:35.992 --> 02:09:43.136]  With this new RFID chip, it will contain a number called an EPC, standing for Electronic Product Code.
[02:09:43.556 --> 02:09:50.640]  And what the EPC does, the plan of this, is to put a unique identifying number on every item on the planet.
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:51.941]  And let me break this down.
[02:09:51.961 --> 02:09:55.803]  This is the Surveillance Total Information Awareness Network system.
[02:09:56.384 --> 02:09:57.684]  We already know grocery stores.
[02:09:57.704 --> 02:10:00.506]  This is admitted in my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:10:01.249 --> 02:10:07.743]  We have a local newscast where they say it's hooked into the driver's license database to your digital thumbprint.
[02:10:07.823 --> 02:10:08.766]  It's for security.
[02:10:09.086 --> 02:10:11.051]  You thumb scan when you go to the grocery store.
[02:10:12.049 --> 02:10:19.816]  Then years ago they made you thumb scan to get a driver's license or an ID, which you have to have a job or a bank account to live.
[02:10:20.397 --> 02:10:27.623]  Now it's a cashless society connection for the global taxation the UN is pushing for the standardization.
[02:10:28.124 --> 02:10:32.988]  Now with the face scan, even if you don't thumb scan, your digital photo is in a database
[02:10:33.388 --> 02:10:43.096]  The camera at Walmart will face scan you, and then they will have a record of what you bought scanned onto the chip, connected to your purchase number, and now they can track and trace you.
[02:10:43.577 --> 02:10:49.402]  And with the antennas of cell towers and radio readers, they can then track and trace your movements and what you do.
[02:10:51.372 --> 02:10:58.400]  Well, and if you throw RFID into the mix, and I think a lot of this, you know, the infrastructure clearly is in the planning stage for a lot of this.
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.682]  I think much of this does not yet exist.
[02:11:00.802 --> 02:11:02.984]  There's already RFIDs in almost everything.
[02:11:03.425 --> 02:11:05.167]  They're just the larger, old-fashioned ones.
[02:11:08.230 --> 02:11:08.971]  Go back up.
[02:11:08.991 --> 02:11:09.711]  Explain that to me.
[02:11:09.972 --> 02:11:11.293]  Well, there's already RFID.
[02:11:11.433 --> 02:11:13.015]  There's an RFID in the money since 96.
[02:11:14.819 --> 02:11:17.701]  Do you have a $5 bill or higher in your wallet right now?
[02:11:18.562 --> 02:11:20.163]  Yeah, I do.
[02:11:21.043 --> 02:11:22.104]  Hold your money up to the light.
[02:11:22.865 --> 02:11:23.245]  Let me do this.
[02:11:23.265 --> 02:11:24.266]  There's a strip in there.
[02:11:24.286 --> 02:11:25.887]  There's an anti-counterfeiting strip.
[02:11:25.947 --> 02:11:30.330]  Yeah, that's an RFID.
[02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:31.671]  That's the Federal Reserve's own admission.
[02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:35.133]  That is a readable strip from a distance.
[02:11:36.203 --> 02:11:36.663]  Do you know that?
[02:11:37.163 --> 02:11:38.044]  No, I did not know that.
[02:11:38.084 --> 02:11:42.025]  In fact, I have numerous denials on record that that's the case.
[02:11:42.125 --> 02:11:42.745]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:47.787]  Well, I'm sure you heard the EU has said they're going to put RFID in all their new money.
[02:11:47.807 --> 02:11:48.747]  Did you see that article?
[02:11:48.787 --> 02:11:55.149]  Yes, that will be by, they're aiming for 2005, but they haven't totally admitted it, but Hitachi has admitted they're working with them on that.
[02:11:55.689 --> 02:11:56.909]  Well, maybe you didn't see the article.
[02:11:56.969 --> 02:11:58.210]  I saw they said they're going to do it.
[02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:02.531]  But, yes, this is a primitive RFID that's in the money.
[02:12:03.251 --> 02:12:04.532]  And the Federal Reserve said in 1999
[02:12:06.432 --> 02:12:13.897]  Already four years ago, that they, that if you do not keep your money in the bank, they're going to devalue it through the tracker strip in the money.
[02:12:14.638 --> 02:12:20.501]  That way they can, it turns your money into a cashless society receipt.
[02:12:20.521 --> 02:12:21.362]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:12:21.662 --> 02:12:28.307]  Yeah, that I actually have heard proposals to do that, to actually check, scan money as it comes out of the ATM machine.
[02:12:28.327 --> 02:12:33.410]  Yeah, and here you are in a record of it, but the Federal Reserve says they'll also devalue it.
[02:12:34.458 --> 02:12:38.605]  I have heard that, but I didn't know that it actually got into effect, so we'll have to see how often it takes down.
[02:12:38.625 --> 02:12:42.430]  Well, no, it was a policy announcement of the Federal Reserve Board of Virginia in 99.
[02:12:45.825 --> 02:12:47.406]  And that's what the new colored money is about.
[02:12:47.446 --> 02:12:49.127]  It has even more of these identifiers in it.
[02:12:49.407 --> 02:12:53.369]  Stay there, we'll talk about it on the other side, and to get into this.
[02:12:53.489 --> 02:12:58.251]  But yes, that is a readable script, in the money, has nothing to do with counterfeiting.
[02:12:58.271 --> 02:12:59.151]  That's just what they say it's for.
[02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:05.034]  It's like they say the Amber Alert is why the Feds can take over every radio and TV station.
[02:13:05.074 --> 02:13:05.914]  Well, I work in radio.
[02:13:05.954 --> 02:13:11.097]  They put the EAS system in in 97, and it is a takeover FEMA system.
[02:13:12.037 --> 02:13:14.018]  Whatever they say it's for, there's always the real reason.
[02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:18.873]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.113 --> 02:13:24.558]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:24.838 --> 02:13:35.206]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:35.366 --> 02:13:39.710]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:40.670]  We're good to go.
[02:13:54.995 --> 02:13:59.479]  Yes, the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:17:19.757 --> 02:17:38.873]  We're talking to the founder and director of Caspian Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering, Catherine
[02:17:40.430 --> 02:17:43.653]  To try to explain this, you know, they call them RFID chips.
[02:17:43.713 --> 02:17:47.295]  They're really, in the more advanced models, transponders.
[02:17:48.436 --> 02:17:48.976]  Not quite.
[02:17:49.977 --> 02:17:52.119]  Let me see if I can clarify the technology.
[02:17:52.199 --> 02:17:55.401]  First, I was going to state two ways that they're different from the barcode.
[02:17:55.461 --> 02:18:05.889]  The first way is in that they contain individual numbers, meaning that your can of Coke could conceivably be registered to you as a different number registered to you than my can of Coke.
[02:18:06.403 --> 02:18:30.743]  So it's almost like a serial number which could conceivably be used at the point of sale as a registration number, meaning that every time you go and stand in a line at a Walmart or a Target or a Home Depot or one of the stores that's using this technology and you scan a credit card, which by the way I recommend everyone pay cash, but let's say you do scan a credit card, all of those item numbers associated with each of the things that you're purchasing could be linked up in a database to your credit card.
[02:18:30.903 --> 02:18:32.865]  But then they're going to say that you've got to
[02:18:34.312 --> 02:18:36.513]  Register it to yourself or you can't return it.
[02:18:36.873 --> 02:18:38.634]  Okay, well there's two pieces to that.
[02:18:38.974 --> 02:18:46.498]  First of all, yes, they are talking about needing these chips to be left on instead of disabled at checkout so that you could make returns.
[02:18:47.238 --> 02:18:57.183]  That's actually in the documentation of these companies themselves, which is a bit ironic because when you ask them about privacy, their first line will be to say, well, we're going to shut them off at checkout.
[02:18:57.583 --> 02:19:00.945]  Well, of course, that's a little bit nuts if you're going to be using them for return.
[02:19:00.985 --> 02:19:03.247]  So they're talking out of both sides of their mouths there.
[02:19:03.587 --> 02:19:16.835]  Yeah, the transponder receives and transmits, and if you scan this and it gives you back the information, you know, these transponders they put in cars that are the size of maybe half an inch long, quarter inch wide.
[02:19:17.416 --> 02:19:19.357]  The San Mato Times last Monday,
[02:19:20.405 --> 02:19:24.551]  In San Francisco, the Bay Area, they said you gotta have these now to drive in the city.
[02:19:24.591 --> 02:19:27.675]  We're going to put up radio readers and scan you as you drive around.
[02:19:27.715 --> 02:19:31.019]  They proposed satellite tracking and taxation for our cars.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:33.122]  They're already putting the infrastructure in.
[02:19:33.723 --> 02:19:37.448]  So I'm talking about what they stated they're going to do with these systems.
[02:19:38.374 --> 02:19:38.634]  Right.
[02:19:38.794 --> 02:19:44.959]  Well, as I said, these are different from the barcode in number one, they have unique numbers, and number two, they are readable from a distance.
[02:19:45.439 --> 02:19:49.221]  I think the only place where we're differing, Alex, is just in terms of the terminology that we're using.
[02:19:49.922 --> 02:19:53.905]  It wouldn't be quite technically correct to say that these devices transmit information.
[02:19:53.945 --> 02:19:58.568]  It would be more correct to say that they pick up ambient radio frequency waves and they reflect them back.
[02:19:58.928 --> 02:19:59.128]  I think?
[02:20:16.667 --> 02:20:17.107]  That's right.
[02:20:39.053 --> 02:20:40.674]  Well, there's a couple of pieces.
[02:20:40.714 --> 02:20:50.877]  At this conference that I attended last week, one of the things being discussed was, while they were asking the opposite question, how do we ensure that we can implement this, because we all stand to make a ton of money from doing it, was their thought on it.
[02:21:07.723 --> 02:21:23.968]  A gentleman by the name of Larry Kellam, K-E-L-L-A-M, who's the Director of Business-to-Business Supply Chain Innovation for Procter & Gamble, gave a talk and he said something towards the end of his talk that I have to say, as a freedom-loving person who follows these things, really sent chills down my spine.
[02:21:24.508 --> 02:21:30.050]  When he was asked, well, what's it going to take to get all this nifty whiz-bang technology out there into the world and into people's homes?
[02:21:30.730 --> 02:21:44.054]  His answer was, well, if we get a declaration from Homeland Security, this is a quote by the way, if we get a declaration from Homeland Security that this is the step we need to take to protect the food supply, that's the step that will move this technology forward.
[02:21:44.214 --> 02:22:00.099]  Well, that's what I saw Reg say over a year ago on C-SPAN, I've got it on one of these myriad tapes, and he said that we're going to put troops and FBI in the infrastructure, and I've got it from Arkansas, they've got FBI at their RFID center.
[02:22:00.794 --> 02:22:06.797]  Well, and that's the piece I would be extremely interested in and information about Walmart because right now Walmart obviously is on our radar screen.
[02:22:06.817 --> 02:22:11.879]  They've called for a hundred of their top suppliers to put these devices on the supply side.
[02:22:11.899 --> 02:22:19.643]  Now this is an important distinction and as people hear about this more they need to be very careful which of these two types of tagging the companies are talking about.
[02:22:20.103 --> 02:22:27.427]  Supply-side tagging means putting it on pallets, putting it on something called a tray, which is a big thing that contains lots of product to move it through the warehouses.
[02:22:28.008 --> 02:22:31.530]  They're trying to claim that's what they're doing, but the call is for them to put it in all the products.
[02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:32.050]  Correct.
[02:22:32.470 --> 02:22:34.772]  Now, here's the buzzword you want to be looking for.
[02:22:34.792 --> 02:22:36.833]  You want to be looking for item-level tagging.
[02:22:37.373 --> 02:22:41.816]  Item-level tagging means putting it actually on products that consumers will be taking home with them.
[02:22:41.856 --> 02:22:44.757]  That would be things like clothing or the packaging for various things.
[02:22:45.198 --> 02:22:47.779]  Right now Gillette is involved in a trial with that.
[02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:54.323]  I would say anyone listening to this program who's buying Gillette, you need to immediately boycott the company, write them a letter, tell them why, and switch to Schick.
[02:22:54.383 --> 02:22:57.324]  And we'll explain why you've got to boycott now when we get back.
[02:22:57.344 --> 02:23:01.927]  Because if you don't start it now, they're going to put it in system-wide, and then it's nothing you can do.
[02:23:04.298 --> 02:23:07.299]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:11.001]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.542 --> 02:23:20.745]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:23:21.425 --> 02:23:25.947]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared kind of 438.

[02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:41.939]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:54.848]  Alright, Catherine Albrecht is our guest, and she is the founder and head of Caspian, Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering.
[02:23:55.989 --> 02:24:04.956]  And the Total Information Awareness Network, run by convicted felon Admiral Poindexter, says everything you buy, everything you sell, everything you do, everything you read, everything you say,
[02:24:05.851 --> 02:24:08.933]  Even how you breathe will be monitored 24 hours a day.
[02:24:08.954 --> 02:24:26.287]  Now those are public announcements, and then now she's there at the big RFID convention where they're peddling all of this, and the big boys are trying to create this infrastructure control, and they're saying, oh we need to get Homeland Security to say this is necessary for the food system, see?
[02:24:27.316 --> 02:24:36.058]  And then that gets Homeland Security into control of that, and they said that you're going to have to have four levels of security passes to have jobs anywhere, so an ID card to have a job.
[02:24:37.318 --> 02:24:41.039]  I've got Ridge on tape saying that, and I know we've got callers who want to talk to Catherine.
[02:24:41.079 --> 02:24:46.381]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, and later I do have some other news coming up.
[02:24:46.581 --> 02:24:49.741]  Catherine, we were talking about ways to counter this, but first,
[02:24:58.310 --> 02:25:04.373]  You know, talking about boycotting it now, anyone who does it now, so they'll back off.
[02:25:04.474 --> 02:25:08.656]  Because if they're able to put it in everywhere, then you can't boycott everyone.
[02:25:09.717 --> 02:25:23.466]  But before we get into that, how to boycott, what are some of the other things, the chilling statements you heard, if any, at the little shindig, the intelligence agency shindig, up in Chicago?
[02:25:23.926 --> 02:25:27.748]  Well, you know, it was funny the amount of religious terminology being tossed around at this event.
[02:25:28.728 --> 02:25:38.532]  One UK chain, which is Marks & Spencer, which claims to be one of the largest clothing retailers in the United Kingdom or in Great Britain, they're putting these tags into clothing.
[02:25:39.036 --> 02:25:45.459]  That they're selling off the shelf and when we're talking about this item level tagging, putting them in things, they call that the Holy Grail.
[02:25:45.559 --> 02:25:49.661]  Item level tagging, putting these chips in individual items people walk out with is the Holy Grail.
[02:25:50.042 --> 02:25:57.585]  There was one gentleman who stood up and he said, I'm with Babylon Information Systems or Babylon Data Systems and I about swallowed my gum there.
[02:25:58.326 --> 02:26:00.967]  A lot of terminology like that floating around.
[02:26:00.987 --> 02:26:02.068]  There was another comment
[02:26:02.888 --> 02:26:13.195]  This is also Marks and Spencer that they're looking at traceability legislation that they expect to go through in Europe, which would mandate traceability of consumer products, particularly food items.
[02:26:13.235 --> 02:26:14.096]  They're looking for that.
[02:26:14.816 --> 02:26:22.061]  And I have to say probably that the, and I don't want you to take this out of context, but there was a comment by a gentleman working for Philip Morris.
[02:26:22.701 --> 02:26:29.746]  And he was on a panel and he was talking about how the supply chain practices are going to have to change to adopt this technology.
[02:26:30.326 --> 02:26:32.929]  And his quote, by the way, his name is William Sweeney.
[02:26:32.989 --> 02:26:36.111]  He's the principal research engineer of Philip Morris USA.
[02:26:36.612 --> 02:26:40.656]  And his comment about the supply chain, now mind you, but I thought it was prophetic.
[02:26:40.716 --> 02:26:42.837]  He said, this is a destructive technology.
[02:26:43.178 --> 02:26:45.440]  Its purpose is to destroy our way of life.
[02:26:46.301 --> 02:26:49.403]  And the whole room kind of went silent and then everyone nervously laughed.
[02:26:49.884 --> 02:26:52.146]  And he paused for dramatic effect after saying that.
[02:26:53.155 --> 02:26:56.176]  So they're against it because they know it'll affect their growing fields.
[02:26:56.196 --> 02:26:57.376]  Oh no, he's totally in favor of it.
[02:26:57.416 --> 02:27:03.959]  He was up there, in fact that whole entire presentation was about how fabulous this is going to be, which is why... Well then why did he say it was destructive?
[02:27:04.459 --> 02:27:09.000]  Well his comment at that point was to say, guys you need to totally revamp your supply chain systems.
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:10.381]  Tear down everything the way you're doing it.
[02:27:10.401 --> 02:27:11.881]  You got to do it this whole new way.
[02:27:12.322 --> 02:27:12.902]  And that's what he said.
[02:27:12.922 --> 02:27:19.464]  Well look, Ridge said you're going to have federal inspectors at all farms, all businesses of any size,
[02:27:20.265 --> 02:27:26.993]  Very intrusive, a new level of taxation and regulation, and this will destroy any underground economy.
[02:27:27.073 --> 02:27:33.862]  Patriot Act 1 has bizarre stipulations about buying and selling and trading without authorization.
[02:27:33.882 --> 02:27:35.163]  People said, what does this mean?
[02:27:35.504 --> 02:27:37.106]  Well, it's obvious where they're going with this.
[02:27:37.992 --> 02:27:42.296]  Well, and I think we're seeing that in the food supply being potentially attacked from many sides.
[02:27:42.356 --> 02:27:51.204]  I just read an article about farmers markets, that they're cracking down on farmers markets now and making people jump through all sorts of health requirements and hoops.
[02:27:51.404 --> 02:27:56.168]  Yeah, it's about getting control of us, it's about controlling the infrastructure, getting us dependent.
[02:27:56.508 --> 02:28:05.262]  Well, and I think food is a key place where anyone who is concerned about privacy, liberty, and freedom needs to really stand up and say, hey, when it comes to my food, you don't mess with that.
[02:28:05.282 --> 02:28:09.709]  Well, the UN said that they would use food as a weapon and that they would make no apologies.
[02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:11.943]  Yeah.
[02:28:12.423 --> 02:28:16.328]  Well, I actually have a follow-up on that that I would be glad to send to anybody who's interested in this.
[02:28:16.368 --> 02:28:21.174]  Let me give out our email address, so if your listeners would like to get more information about what we're doing.
[02:28:21.194 --> 02:28:22.295]  We have a free newsletter.
[02:28:22.656 --> 02:28:23.857]  People are welcome to sign up for.
[02:28:23.917 --> 02:28:27.281]  We're online at www.nocards.org.
[02:28:27.361 --> 02:28:29.164]  We got started fighting supermarket cards in 1999.
[02:28:30.605 --> 02:28:34.008]  Uh, if you click on the feedback form there, you can fill out your email address.
[02:28:34.048 --> 02:28:37.350]  We'll go ahead and get you on our mailing list and keep you posted on what we're doing.
[02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:45.756]  And anybody who requests it, I'd be happy to send you a 50-page article I've written on retail surveillance, which will give you 200 footnotes, and you can prove all of the things we've been talking about.
[02:28:45.776 --> 02:28:48.758]  Well, also, Catherine, they've already announced that
[02:28:49.358 --> 02:28:57.805]  They want to make people tag all of their produce and livestock and have this new federal regulatory system locally in your area.
[02:28:57.846 --> 02:29:04.952]  Your goats, your sheep, your cows, your horses, your pigs, any livestock or any domesticated animals.
[02:29:05.772 --> 02:29:09.396]  LA has made it the law where you got to put a chip in your dog or cat period.
[02:29:10.016 --> 02:29:11.738]  It started out if you got them from the pound.
[02:29:12.638 --> 02:29:13.818]  But now it's all animals.
[02:29:13.858 --> 02:29:15.259]  A bunch of other cities are doing it.
[02:29:15.399 --> 02:29:19.760]  Total control, total surveillance, and this centralizes control as well.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:33.204]  Well, you know, Alex, it's funny because I know your listeners probably share our mindset, but if you're ever talking to somebody who says, you know, this is all going to make us safer, the response I give to that, and by the way, I'm a doctoral researcher at Harvard University.
[02:29:33.244 --> 02:29:39.846]  I'm working on my dissertation on consumer psychology, and I've done a lot of reading of history, and why is it that people tolerate this kind of thing in their lives?
[02:29:40.416 --> 02:29:44.037]  And whenever somebody says, you know, well, I guess we have to give up a little bit to be safer.
[02:29:44.417 --> 02:29:49.799]  If everybody surveilled and there was a camera in every bedroom, I guess we'd all just be safe and maybe we need to move in that direction.
[02:29:50.299 --> 02:29:54.920]  And what I say, well, if you want to know what that will be like, we've got some great examples in history where you can look at that.
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:58.001]  Talk about Stalin's Soviet Union, for example.
[02:29:58.341 --> 02:30:02.002]  I mean, that was arguably the most surveilled society on the planet.
[02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:08.133]  Every piece of mail was opened, every phone call potentially listened in on, every neighbor spying on every other neighbor.
[02:30:08.393 --> 02:30:12.215]  You couldn't even have somebody over to dinner without knowing if they were reporting back to the KGB.
[02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:13.296]  Were they safe?
[02:30:13.777 --> 02:30:14.717]  Absolutely not!
[02:30:14.797 --> 02:30:22.642]  In fact, now historians are saying that Stalin may have killed upwards of 60 million of his own people, people that he surveilled and found that, hey, you know, guess what?
[02:30:22.662 --> 02:30:25.985]  They didn't like the prevailing system, because the prevailing system was killing people!
[02:30:26.425 --> 02:30:29.267]  So, if we go forward with this RFID
[02:30:30.087 --> 02:30:30.827]  Well, a lot worse.
[02:30:50.663 --> 02:31:16.852]  This is about control, and they're using terror as their excuse, but then take what they're doing with the borders being more open than they were before 9-1-1, and 800 plus cities accepting any fake ID from anybody from Poland or Mexico, it doesn't matter, the matricula cards, and on top of that, I mean it's a joke, this is an excuse to centralize power and control, and to blow out any type of grassroots business or infrastructure.
[02:31:17.152 --> 02:31:20.213]  This is about total centralization, a compact city.
[02:31:21.969 --> 02:31:30.956]  Well, if that was your goal, and I'm not quite sure whose goal that would be, but let's say that was your goal, RFID technology would be an ideal tool to fall into those hands.
[02:31:31.016 --> 02:31:45.287]  And I've said many times publicly, I believe if Hitler had had this technology, there's not a Jew who would have escaped from any of the countries under his control, because this technology enables you to track people to know who's interacting with who, who's carrying what, who's doing what.
[02:31:45.787 --> 02:31:50.571]  And any form of resistance against a tyrannical government could easily be detected and squashed.
[02:31:53.050 --> 02:31:59.834]  I was actually used by Hitler with some of their primitive computers to do this.
[02:32:00.955 --> 02:32:04.917]  And, I mean, I don't think he's ever... No, it's all about IBM's involvement with RFID technology.
[02:32:04.937 --> 02:32:08.519]  They made an announcement right after Walmart that they're throwing their weight behind RFID.
[02:32:08.859 --> 02:32:16.424]  And one of their applications is to put an RFID identification chip into people's checkbooks and ATM cards.
[02:32:16.843 --> 02:32:23.807]  So that all you'd have to do would be walk through the doorway of your bank and your bank would instantly identify you and your bank balance and would treat you accordingly.
[02:32:23.947 --> 02:32:41.838]  Well for three years, IBM's been running the ad for IBM Blue, where the guy walks in the store, sticks a chicken in his shirt, a bag of potato chips, beer, and he's walking out and the security guard runs over and says, excuse me sir, you forgot your receipt.
[02:32:42.478 --> 02:32:43.779]  So everybody saw that ad,
[02:32:44.759 --> 02:32:46.360]  And that's what they're doing, bottom line.
[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:53.902]  Absolutely, and that's the model for how Walmart wants this, or well, many of these retailers ultimately would like to see this work, to where there wouldn't be any cashiers.
[02:32:53.982 --> 02:32:57.823]  I mean, imagine the jobs that would be eliminated because of this, and the people would be out of work.
[02:32:57.943 --> 02:32:58.764]  That's a separate issue.
[02:32:59.124 --> 02:33:01.544]  Where essentially the machines would be in charge of everything.
[02:33:01.584 --> 02:33:09.467]  These little tags would interact with the machines, and you know, the vision of Kevin Ashton, who is the founder of the Auto ID Center, I've heard him speak many times, and
[02:33:09.807 --> 02:33:16.811]  Every time I hear him speak, a chill goes down my spine because he envisions the world where the machines are in charge, where really we don't need people to do very much anymore.
[02:33:16.831 --> 02:33:19.073]  The machines have everything under control.
[02:33:19.233 --> 02:33:23.395]  And this in a world where they told us we were going to be a service economy, don't worry about your industry.
[02:33:23.916 --> 02:33:27.178]  And this in a world where there's less and less service.
[02:33:27.518 --> 02:33:32.781]  I mean, look, McDonald's learned how to put a trash can up and say, thank you.
[02:33:34.105 --> 02:33:37.568]  And then there's peer pressure to throw your food away.
[02:33:37.588 --> 02:33:38.909]  Well, all that does is get rid of a job.
[02:33:38.949 --> 02:33:40.790]  And they say, oh, well, it's competitive.
[02:33:40.850 --> 02:33:45.434]  No, if we demand more service, they will simply build more service into the economy.
[02:33:45.634 --> 02:33:50.117]  There'll be more jobs, more circulation of money, and we'll actually have a better economy.
[02:33:50.538 --> 02:33:52.079]  But this is about control.
[02:33:52.139 --> 02:33:53.160]  They set it as their vision.
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:57.123]  These compact, control grid, cashless society cities.
[02:33:58.058 --> 02:34:04.583]  I mean, look, they're already thumb scanning people in Texas grocery stores and they admit it's hooked into the DPS database off your thumbprint.
[02:34:04.643 --> 02:34:07.626]  I have H-E-B employees on tape admitting it.
[02:34:08.586 --> 02:34:10.348]  So, there it is right there, Catherine.
[02:34:10.588 --> 02:34:15.232]  Well, let's talk about how to fight back because I hate to leave people with this dark vision.
[02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:21.074]  Right now, we as consumer citizens are in a catbird state when it comes to this RFID technology.
[02:34:21.114 --> 02:34:24.635]  Let me give you an optimistic or a story with a good ending.
[02:34:25.075 --> 02:34:33.957]  Back in March, Benetton, the Italian clothing manufacturer, made an announcement that they were going to be putting 350 million of these chips into their clothing items and selling them to people.
[02:34:34.118 --> 02:34:35.938]  It was primarily underwear.
[02:34:36.465 --> 02:34:38.687]  So, people would be walking around with chipped underwear.
[02:34:39.047 --> 02:34:47.774]  Now, even though they said this could be turned off at the point of sale, that they'd just disable the chip at the check register, we did a little research and we found out that the chip they were going to be using could not be turned off.
[02:34:47.854 --> 02:34:52.958]  It could only be put into hibernation mode, and anybody with the access to the right code could turn it right on again.
[02:34:52.978 --> 02:34:55.040]  So, we thought that wasn't very good assurance.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:58.943]  Well, let me tell you that consumers around the world went ballistic.
[02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:02.146]  We put up a website, BoycottBenetton.com.
[02:35:02.186 --> 02:35:03.387]  It's still up there.
[02:35:03.547 --> 02:35:04.848]  Actually, BoycottBenetton.org.
[02:35:04.868 --> 02:35:05.869]  You can still find it on the net.
[02:35:06.449 --> 02:35:11.796]  We called for a worldwide boycott, and I was doing interviews as far away as Tasmania.
[02:35:12.116 --> 02:35:14.239]  I was on Sweden National Public Radio.
[02:35:14.299 --> 02:35:18.684]  I mean, you would not believe the amount of international attention and outcry that generated.
[02:35:19.004 --> 02:35:26.393]  Well, I'm telling you, we had Benetton running for cover with their tail between their legs, saying that they are not going to do it, they'd take it back, please don't boycott us.
[02:35:26.937 --> 02:35:36.244]  Now right now you've got 90 global corporations and now probably a whole bunch more now with Walmart's announcement waiting to see what's going to happen with the trials that are happening right now.
[02:35:36.284 --> 02:35:38.406]  Let me tell you what those are and what we need to do about them.
[02:35:39.421 --> 02:35:41.522]  Gillette is probably the number one.
[02:35:41.542 --> 02:35:51.387]  Gillette put in an order for a half a billion of these chips in November, and they're testing them on real people in real time in real Walmart stores right now, where they have surveillance cameras trained on the shelf.
[02:35:51.427 --> 02:35:57.190]  When you pick it up off the shelf, it sends a little alert back to the surveillance camera that knows something's been picked up off the shelf.
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:35:59.411]  Well that's a reason right there not to do it.
[02:35:59.451 --> 02:36:00.652]  I mean, think about this!
[02:36:01.212 --> 02:36:04.254]  Oh, they're watching people in the stores interacting with these Gillette lasers.
[02:36:04.274 --> 02:36:12.258]  There was a Washington Post article about the pressure plates on the floor, hidden cameras that know how to read your eye, what area you're reading on the shelf.
[02:36:12.539 --> 02:36:13.019]  You got it.
[02:36:13.059 --> 02:36:14.760]  Well, all this stuff is going to converge.
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:20.203]  Now, let me tell you, Gillette is openly acknowledging that they're messing around with this technology with real consumers.
[02:36:20.843 --> 02:36:36.063]  And I believe that the, well I know for a fact that the whole rest of the industry, all these other companies like Kraft and you know all the makeup companies and shoe companies and clothing companies, all these other companies are holding their breath to see if Gillette's going to get its wrist slapped like Benetton did.
[02:36:36.610 --> 02:36:45.895]  Now, if we consumers sit back and let Gillette get away with this, within six months you're going to have a dozen more companies, then two dozen, and then before we turn around twice, every item in the store is going to have these tags in them.
[02:36:46.315 --> 02:36:48.396]  Right now, our target is very focused.
[02:36:48.476 --> 02:36:52.158]  It's Gillette, it's Michelin who put these things in their tires, believe it or not.
[02:36:52.198 --> 02:36:57.000]  Now you can track a car going 90 miles an hour from five feet away if it's got this Michelin tag in it.
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.982]  And the other one is Max Factor Lipfinity Lipstick.
[02:37:00.422 --> 02:37:05.223]  Alright, so this is a very small handful of companies that would be very easy to boycott.
[02:37:05.503 --> 02:37:09.104]  And what we would like to do at Caspian, you can find us at NoCards.org.
[02:37:09.644 --> 02:37:13.925]  We also have a preview website up at StopRFID.org.
[02:37:14.385 --> 02:37:19.567]  You can see some images of what these tags look like and some other information, but that website doesn't go public until next week.
[02:37:19.587 --> 02:37:25.388]  Folks, we're fighting for the life of this country against the cashless society control grid.
[02:37:26.128 --> 02:37:31.813]  And we are talking to the director of Caspian, and we've had her on before.
[02:37:31.833 --> 02:37:35.095]  Catherine, why don't you tell people about your bio one more time for those that missed it?
[02:37:35.376 --> 02:37:37.838]  Yeah, I am the founder and director of Caspian.
[02:37:38.258 --> 02:37:42.081]  We have been fighting grocery store cards and retail surveillance since 1999.
[02:37:42.421 --> 02:37:49.106]  You can find us on the internet at nocards.org, and at that website, if you click the feedback bar, you can get on our mailing list, which is free.
[02:37:49.126 --> 02:37:50.928]  We'll give you all the information and sign you up.
[02:37:50.948 --> 02:37:52.029]  We're looking for volunteers.
[02:37:52.629 --> 02:37:58.335]  I am a doctoral candidate at Harvard University, where I'm writing my dissertation on consumer psychology issues.
[02:37:58.755 --> 02:38:02.699]  I have an undergraduate degree in international marketing, so I know how these guys think.
[02:38:02.759 --> 02:38:03.739]  I know where they're coming from.
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:09.985]  Back when I got my degree, it was not quite the surveillance environment it is today, though, and I guess I'm a recovering marketer.
[02:38:10.005 --> 02:38:17.112]  All right, so we've got to stop them now, just like with the biometrics when HEB and Kroger's puts in the thumb scanners, or even tears out
[02:38:17.772 --> 02:38:20.694]  You've got to boycott Michelin, you've got to boycott Max Factor.
[02:38:20.714 --> 02:38:21.214]  Let's take a call.
[02:38:21.234 --> 02:38:21.614]  Let's talk to
[02:38:46.329 --> 02:38:46.769]  Oh, I guess.
[02:38:46.809 --> 02:38:48.110]  Who's up next here, Mark?
[02:38:50.312 --> 02:38:51.152]  Carmine?
[02:38:51.973 --> 02:38:52.713]  Who's up next?
[02:38:52.733 --> 02:38:54.614]  I'm not sure.
[02:38:56.035 --> 02:38:57.196]  Harmon in Pennsylvania.
[02:38:57.216 --> 02:38:57.876]  You're on the air.
[02:38:57.936 --> 02:38:58.377]  Go ahead.
[02:38:59.097 --> 02:38:59.657]  Good afternoon.
[02:38:59.677 --> 02:39:01.719]  I just want to give you three quick things.
[02:39:02.879 --> 02:39:04.861]  All those devices are transponders.
[02:39:04.941 --> 02:39:07.722]  The ones that have batteries in them just have greater range.
[02:39:08.263 --> 02:39:11.765]  The three frequency ranges that they have right now are up to like four gigahertz.
[02:39:13.102 --> 02:39:21.946]  Also, the NTIS, the National Technology Information System, has a grid work across all highways and service roads in the United States.
[02:39:22.487 --> 02:39:24.328]  And every car in America has the chip in it.
[02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:25.568]  New cars.
[02:39:26.489 --> 02:39:28.029]  Thank you for that clarification.
[02:39:28.270 --> 02:39:32.672]  Yeah, when you drive around, they've got the antenna arrays now all over the highways, it's admitted.
[02:39:32.772 --> 02:39:37.794]  Well, you look on the ground, you'll see two circles cut in the ground, one right after another.
[02:39:37.914 --> 02:39:39.655]  One excites the chip, the chip
[02:39:40.222 --> 02:39:41.223]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:58.675 --> 02:40:02.758]  And they're going to be monitoring everything, and they will tax us on every inch of the road if they can.
[02:40:02.778 --> 02:40:08.101]  By the way, when I was on I-35 driving up to Kansas City and we asked questions about it, they confirmed it.
[02:40:08.562 --> 02:40:10.463]  They were cutting these into the roads, by the way.
[02:40:10.483 --> 02:40:16.447]  Well, caller, if you could do me a favor and my email address for anyone who'd like to write me is K-M-A
[02:40:18.731 --> 02:40:21.852]  That's KMA at NoCards.org.
[02:40:22.593 --> 02:40:29.277]  And by the way, anyone else who wrote down that email address, if you ask me for it, I'll send you a 50-page research report that I wrote for the Denver Law Review.
[02:40:29.497 --> 02:40:31.138]  Well, that's nice of you.
[02:40:32.139 --> 02:40:33.400]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:36.161]  Is this not chilling, Carmen, to see this happening?
[02:40:36.582 --> 02:40:39.483]  Yes, and you'll see the little silver boxes on the side of the road.
[02:40:39.563 --> 02:40:40.844]  It's only on one side of the road.
[02:40:40.864 --> 02:40:41.785]  It could be on either side.
[02:40:41.805 --> 02:40:45.187]  They usually have the network of wires running across both lanes of traffic.
[02:40:45.692 --> 02:40:50.813]  And I've seen them where they've had as many as eight lanes of traffic, four lanes on each side, all hooked up.
[02:40:51.173 --> 02:40:52.053]  Unbelievable.
[02:40:52.093 --> 02:40:55.814]  Could you please do me a favor and send me some documentation on that, because I will get the word out.
[02:40:56.114 --> 02:40:56.494]  Okay.
[02:40:56.674 --> 02:40:57.054]  Thank you.
[02:40:57.234 --> 02:40:57.734]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:58.254 --> 02:40:59.195]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[02:40:59.215 --> 02:41:00.835]  We're going to break with our final segment with our guests.
[02:41:00.855 --> 02:41:02.835]  We'll come back and talk to Jason in Texas and a few others.
[02:41:03.775 --> 02:41:07.976]  Folks, they said they're going to take over farming, industry, businesses.
[02:41:08.516 --> 02:41:11.617]  The Army is going to be on the streets carrying all of this out.
[02:41:12.569 --> 02:41:13.950]  Ridge officially on C-SPAN.
[02:41:13.970 --> 02:41:15.671]  The problem is, I can't know it all.
[02:41:16.171 --> 02:41:17.572]  Catherine can't be aware of it all.
[02:41:18.053 --> 02:41:23.356]  The onslaught, the attack, the prison they're building is so huge.
[02:41:23.376 --> 02:41:25.317]  We've got to warn people now.
[02:41:25.857 --> 02:41:29.300]  They built the infrastructure, then they announce it to you.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.182]  Right here in Austin, thumb scanners going in the grocery store.
[02:41:33.482 --> 02:41:34.743]  And soon, no cash allowed.
[02:41:35.985 --> 02:41:40.330]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:44.936]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.096 --> 02:41:49.461]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.501 --> 02:41:50.842]  The New World Order.
[02:41:51.603 --> 02:41:52.583]  Panama.
[02:41:52.643 --> 02:41:56.845]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.925 --> 02:42:03.847]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.987 --> 02:42:06.027]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.347 --> 02:42:16.790]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:18.951]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:42:19.531 --> 02:42:20.732]  This is my new two and a half hour video.
[02:42:20.752 --> 02:42:22.374]  Police Day 3 is for you!
[02:42:22.855 --> 02:42:26.058]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:26.118 --> 02:42:26.619]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:26.639 --> 02:42:27.920]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:42:35.408 --> 02:42:38.869]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.149 --> 02:42:42.649]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:42.729 --> 02:42:46.670]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:53.051]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:53.471 --> 02:43:01.373]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:01.793 --> 02:43:07.138]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:43:07.298 --> 02:43:11.061]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:11.442 --> 02:43:13.283]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:43:13.363 --> 02:43:15.525]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:43:15.765 --> 02:43:20.369]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:43:20.409 --> 02:43:26.294]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:43:29.677 --> 02:43:33.521]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:43:34.182 --> 02:43:34.922]  Are you prepared?
[02:43:35.123 --> 02:43:37.525]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[02:43:37.745 --> 02:43:42.169]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[02:43:42.470 --> 02:43:45.953]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[02:43:46.173 --> 02:43:48.315]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[02:43:49.036 --> 02:43:53.017]  Jerry Detty from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[02:43:53.257 --> 02:43:56.197]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[02:43:56.297 --> 02:44:03.379]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[02:44:03.599 --> 02:44:08.920]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[02:44:09.180 --> 02:44:14.181]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[02:44:14.401 --> 02:44:15.341]  Jerry can help here too.
[02:44:16.261 --> 02:44:20.924]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[02:44:21.164 --> 02:44:25.066]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[02:44:25.207 --> 02:44:27.128]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[02:44:27.148 --> 02:44:28.188]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit ArkInstitute.com.
[02:44:46.984 --> 02:44:50.787]  Talking to Catherine Albrecht and she's the founder of Caspian.
[02:44:51.868 --> 02:44:53.149]  A total grid of control.
[02:44:53.169 --> 02:44:59.293]  They're now using the transponders publicly in San Francisco to track, trace and tax you even off the toll roads.
[02:45:00.594 --> 02:45:01.375]  This is the system.
[02:45:01.395 --> 02:45:04.477]  They've announced satellite tracking to begin very soon to start taxing you.
[02:45:05.477 --> 02:45:11.862]  They're building the infrastructure all around you and the average American has no idea but they know all about the football scores, don't they?
[02:45:13.514 --> 02:45:14.995]  Catherine, let's take a final call.
[02:45:15.875 --> 02:45:17.636]  Jason in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:45:17.676 --> 02:45:18.477]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:45:21.458 --> 02:45:22.519]  Okay, he's not there.
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:24.660]  Jason, are you there?
[02:45:25.161 --> 02:45:25.501]  Yeah.
[02:45:25.781 --> 02:45:26.561]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:45:26.881 --> 02:45:27.522]  How are things?
[02:45:28.062 --> 02:45:28.782]  Well, they're pretty good.
[02:45:28.823 --> 02:45:29.243]  Go ahead.
[02:45:29.523 --> 02:45:29.963]  Excellent.
[02:45:30.403 --> 02:45:35.806]  Listen, I just wanted to let you know, kind of a Catch-22 situation.
[02:45:35.966 --> 02:45:38.708]  I have a small software business here in Austin.
[02:45:39.862 --> 02:45:55.974]  And recently, with a lot of the federal appropriations because of this Homeland Security stuff, state agencies, not unlike the Department of Corrections, have been receiving federal dollars to digitalize just about everything.
[02:45:57.455 --> 02:46:02.598]  It's not really congruent with the stuff you've been talking about in the last hour.
[02:46:03.219 --> 02:46:07.562]  But say, for example, an RFP goes out.
[02:46:08.857 --> 02:46:22.883]  A number of different resellers, a number of different businesses send in proposals, and then the state, of course, selects a business.
[02:46:22.943 --> 02:46:32.067]  What they're trying to do is really unprecedented, and they're doing it by way of retention numbers.
[02:46:32.107 --> 02:46:35.709]  If you've ever been involved with a legal case, you know about Bates numbering.
[02:46:37.627 --> 02:46:54.419]  But basically, what happens is with these retention numbers, or in this case, we'll call a base number, any name or any concept or any business that's on any document is basically affiliated with a number.
[02:46:55.340 --> 02:46:57.061]  And it's all tracked.
[02:46:57.342 --> 02:47:04.307]  Now, the catch-22 of the situation is that I'm pretty much responsible for
[02:47:05.444 --> 02:47:07.185]  Developing this type of technology.
[02:47:08.145 --> 02:47:14.847]  And the thing is, the only money that's coming in is money from the Fed.
[02:47:15.127 --> 02:47:17.248]  This is the growth industry they are.
[02:47:17.268 --> 02:47:21.789]  They construct the economy and then offer money in growth industries for the surveillance grid.
[02:47:21.849 --> 02:47:22.989]  Catherine, any comments to that?
[02:47:24.130 --> 02:47:24.630]  Oh boy!
[02:47:25.890 --> 02:47:27.911]  All I can say is it seems like it's coming from every angle.
[02:47:29.485 --> 02:47:30.265]  Absolutely.
[02:47:30.686 --> 02:47:32.306]  Jason, I've got to let you go.
[02:47:32.326 --> 02:47:36.909]  You can call me back tonight or tomorrow or on Monday and we can talk more about it.
[02:47:36.929 --> 02:47:37.589]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:38.889 --> 02:47:40.290]  Catherine, I've got to get you back on.
[02:47:40.310 --> 02:47:41.231]  I've been ranting and raving.
[02:47:41.251 --> 02:47:42.031]  This is horrible.
[02:47:42.191 --> 02:47:43.932]  I want to commend you for fighting this.
[02:47:44.072 --> 02:47:46.353]  All Americans better get involved and educate themselves.
[02:47:46.413 --> 02:47:49.835]  This is for the Cashless Society tracking taxation grid.
[02:47:50.135 --> 02:47:53.697]  It totally violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendment and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:47:53.757 --> 02:47:55.157]  NoCards.org.
[02:47:55.317 --> 02:47:57.038]  We are in a perfect position to stop it.
[02:47:57.058 --> 02:47:58.279]  I can't emphasize that enough.
[02:47:59.099 --> 02:48:06.386]  I feel like this is a leverage point in history right now, because these companies really don't want to lose all of our business and they don't want a public relations problem.
[02:48:06.826 --> 02:48:12.311]  If we get on board and put up a couple of billboards saying, you know, is there a censor in your Gillette Censor Razor?
[02:48:12.351 --> 02:48:14.633]  Is there a tracker in your Gillette Track 2 Razor?
[02:48:15.173 --> 02:48:19.017]  The media would pick it up, and I'm telling you, I know, because I've talked to members of the media.
[02:48:19.057 --> 02:48:19.958]  This is a mainstream media.
[02:48:19.978 --> 02:48:20.618]  We can stop.
[02:48:20.718 --> 02:48:22.260]  I've got to let you go.
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:23.401]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:48:23.421 --> 02:48:24.361]  We'll have you back on, okay?
[02:48:24.381 --> 02:48:25.142]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:25.522 --> 02:48:26.063]  Appreciate it.
[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:27.901]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:28.281 --> 02:48:29.582]  My films cover this.
[02:48:29.802 --> 02:48:33.324]  America Destroyed by Design, Road to Tyranny, Police State 3.
[02:48:33.404 --> 02:48:34.865]  You've got to get these videos.
[02:48:34.905 --> 02:48:40.329]  You've got to make copies so the dumbbells out there can be woken up and join us to understand what's happening.
[02:48:40.989 --> 02:48:44.272]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:44.752 --> 02:48:46.473]  Order the films right now.
[02:48:46.693 --> 02:48:47.794]  Make a hundred copies.
[02:48:48.174 --> 02:48:49.075]  Fight the globalists.
[02:48:49.595 --> 02:48:51.677]  Toll free number to order 1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:51.697 --> 02:48:56.480]  Don't wait.
[02:48:57.641 --> 02:48:58.461]  Get the videos.
[02:48:58.522 --> 02:48:59.222]  Get my book.
[02:48:59.582 --> 02:49:07.708]  Go to Infowars.com or net to order or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:08.248 --> 02:49:09.689]  They are building a prison.
[02:49:09.769 --> 02:49:12.231]  They have said they're going to control you and tax you with it.
[02:49:12.692 --> 02:49:13.392]  Resist them.
[02:49:13.532 --> 02:49:14.413]  Educate everyone.
[02:49:14.753 --> 02:49:15.674]  Warn the people.
[02:49:15.774 --> 02:49:16.915]  Ring the alarm bells.
[02:49:17.335 --> 02:49:18.836]  The videos are a great tool to do it.
[02:49:19.437 --> 02:49:19.918]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:20.438 --> 02:49:22.960]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:23.121 --> 02:49:23.801]  God bless you all.
[02:49:26.184 --> 02:49:29.187]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:29.507 --> 02:49:34.452]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:34.692 --> 02:49:36.834]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they are
