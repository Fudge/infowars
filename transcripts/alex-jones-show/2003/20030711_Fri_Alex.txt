[00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:06.131]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:15.262]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.943 --> 00:00:16.983]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:18.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:20.284]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:21.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.226]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:30.868]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.673]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:46.295]  It is Tuesday, the 8th of July, 2003.
[00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:51.117]  Big show for you lined up today.
[00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:04.209]  In the first hour, we have the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com joining us.
[00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:05.509]  He's Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.709]  He lives in the United Kingdom.
[00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:21.634]  He has a great head on his shoulders for analyzing the New World Order and covering and posting pertinent facts and tracking their lies and doing daily flashbacks to show how they put out different propaganda almost on a daily basis now.
[00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:29.209]  We'll also talk about his upcoming book, and no, we're not offering it yet, and yes, I'm publishing it, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:30.690]  Talk about a powerful name.
[00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.572]  Well, it's a powerful book, and it's lengthy.
[00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:45.240]  We'll go over some of what's in the book, some of the key smoking guns of September 11th, and we'll get a British perspective on the high-tech police state they have developing there, the disarmament of the British people,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:59.233]  We'll talk about the lies of that government concerning Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and his opinion on British citizens held at Camp X-Ray to be tried without juries and, yes, to be executed.
[00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:01.575]  So that's all coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:02.917]  Then in the third hour,
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.504]  We've got Catherine Albrecht, the head of Caspian, coming on the show.
[00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:11.385]  We had her on a few weeks ago.
[00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:16.549]  You know, we were talking about RFIDs before RFIDs were cool, as they say.
[00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.735]  The small, trackable microchips that are going to go in all your clothes, all your razors, all your food cans and containers, everything!
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.488]  And we told you it was about a control grid to tax and trace you.
[00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.103]  Well now, Caspian, their organization has basically, I want to say hacked
[00:02:36.943 --> 00:02:46.408]  But used software to get into internal areas of the big RFID consortium's website and got secret documents.
[00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.291]  And the RFID group admits they're accurate and are very angry.
[00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:59.476]  And they talk about how they want to, quote, manipulate, neutralize, pacify you, and get you to accept the cashless society control grid.
[00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:05.080]  It's great what the technology people on the side of Liberty are able to do.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.791]  It's like when Orrin Hatch came out and said, hack anybody's computer and destroy it if they download anything that's not authorized, video, audio.
[00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:20.437]  Well, folks just went to Hatch's website and found out that he had pirated software.
[00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:26.399]  He'd used pirated software to build his very fancy, expensive website.
[00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.619]  So, there were thousands of dollars.
[00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.780]  Just one piece of software that they'd stolen cost $400.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.761]  A serious crime!
[00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:39.083]  And so the organization that went in and scanned his site and found out that they didn't
[00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.884]  Uh, have the proper serial numbers for the stuff.
[00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:43.544]  It's stolen it.
[00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:47.426]  Uh, they're now calling for Hatch to be arrested, and I think it's a great idea.
[00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:50.407]  He's a gun-grabbing, un-American LIBERAL!
[00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:53.228]  And I'm SICK of neocons like him!
[00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:58.950]  So, we're on the march, the Empire's on the run, but that only makes them more dangerous.
[00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.951]  We will track the latest global developments and unravel the New World Order.
[00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.252]  Here on the show today.
[00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:07.433]  Big show lined up.
[00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:10.874]  And we're going to take a lot of phone calls in this first hour.
[00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:12.275]  And Watson's on with us.
[00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:13.956]  So you'll definitely want to join us.
[00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:15.917]  The total free number to get involved on air.
[00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:18.078]  In fact, I'll take calls before we even get Watson on.
[00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:20.379]  The folks calling want to talk about some issues.
[00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.839]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:20.899]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:40.264]  Now, the White House today had to admit that, yes, they knew that Africa didn't sell Saddam uranium and that Bush lied in his State of the Union.
[00:04:40.304 --> 00:04:41.366]  That's kind of a big deal.
[00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:46.546]  And why about everything else being the big socialists, big government liberals?
[00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:47.047]  They are.
[00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:48.487]  The neocons?
[00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:48.987]  They are.
[00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:50.808]  The lying creatures?
[00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:51.308]  They are.
[00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:53.669]  So that's coming up also.
[00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:59.751]  Ministry of Defense report for scorn on evidence of Iraq weapons of mass destruction, admitting they lied.
[00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:04.252]  Blair's now been caught in his little fight with the BBC as being a big fat liar.
[00:05:05.453 --> 00:05:06.873]  Frank says bring it on.
[00:05:06.913 --> 00:05:07.434]  More U.S.
[00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:08.134]  troops get killed.
[00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:08.574]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:10.288]  Remember what it was.
[00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:11.308]  Hello, everybody.
[00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:12.569]  My name is Bob Barefoot.
[00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.910]  I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coral Calcium Supreme Plus.
[00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.051]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coral calcium from Okinawa, Japan, and almost twice as much of all other nutrients.
[00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:30.773]  Today, it's the best bang for your buck in the health nutrients industry, and coral calcium is the nutrient of the 21st century.

[00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:36.456]  Bob wants to help heal America.

[00:06:10.026 --> 00:06:16.851]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:18.552]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:20.953]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:23.195]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:28.418]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.801]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:34.803]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:39.886]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control,
[00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:40.566]  I think so.
[00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:10.836]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:11.216 --> 00:07:16.959]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.342]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:31.968]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:32.308 --> 00:07:37.250]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:41.633]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:41.813 --> 00:07:46.575]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:52.818]  Emergency Lights' revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:01.405]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:14.918]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:16.639]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:18.480]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.940]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.601]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:25.882]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:30.564]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:42.629]  You know, I've said it so many times and it's true, because you're calm, you're
[00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.273]  You're happy, at least some of the time.
[00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:54.881]  During the breaks, we have discussions that are much more entertaining and interesting and informative than we have on the air.
[00:08:55.141 --> 00:09:03.269]  And it doesn't matter if I'm doing Real Talk Radio on Saturdays with John Stattmiller, or if I'm doing a show with Michael Trudeau, or if I'm just talking to
[00:09:04.184 --> 00:09:05.545]  We're good to go.
[00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:44.000]  I got a special deal because one of my friends runs a fireworks stand, so I got them at cost, but by the time we got done rattling off the different fireworks we had bought, I believe that Mark and Matt have defeated me.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.662]  They actually got more fireworks than I did.
[00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:51.189]  Alright, this sounds like mainstream radio now.
[00:09:51.710 --> 00:10:04.059]  I'm starting the show discussing fireworks, but I do enjoy going out with family in the middle of the countryside on a beautiful star-filled night and shooting fireworks off for three hours.
[00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:05.800]  I really did enjoy it.
[00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:14.367]  And I love the Fourth of July, but I don't love the Fourth of July just because my dad made the best beef, ribs, and brisket that he smoked all day.
[00:10:16.619 --> 00:10:23.502]  And I didn't just enjoy the Fourth of July because we shot all these fireworks off, what my uncle bought, what my dad bought, and what I bought.
[00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:37.508]  I enjoyed the Fourth of July because I remembered those that fought and died to make America the successful experiment it was, and should still be, but it's frankly not, folks, in many respects, a free society.
[00:10:39.022 --> 00:10:53.645]  Because on my way, and I talked about this some yesterday, but you really can't stress it enough, on my way to East Texas to visit family from Central Texas, I watched swarms, wolf packs, and they even call them wolf packs,
[00:10:55.121 --> 00:11:14.216]  of state police and others with local police swarming in MJTF wolf packs, multi-jurisdictional task forces, they would exit off the road, come back onto the road, randomly pull over five, ten cars, all together in mass, just totally randomly, and then you'd come across wolf packs that had already pulled over their quarry,
[00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:23.782]  And they would have families standing out on the side of the road in the heat and the fire ants, their goods stacked out on the road, their fireworks being inspected.
[00:11:23.802 --> 00:11:34.370]  I saw this toddler standing there with his mother in fear, looking at these officers as they directed the father to dig through his car and remove the spare tire for them.
[00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:44.237]  And I wanted to pull over, and I wanted to scream at those police officers that they're desecrating everything America is, was, and is going to be!
[00:11:46.798 --> 00:11:48.219]  And then it just got worse and worse.
[00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:57.803]  There were flashing billboards, report illegal guns, report tips, report terrorism, don't drink and drive, drink and drive, go to jail.
[00:11:58.263 --> 00:12:03.545]  You know, the billboard started just don't drink and drive, now it's report guns, report terrorists.
[00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:06.186]  I heard little FEMA announcements on the radio.
[00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:11.088]  I heard talk show hosts saying we should be thankful to the government on the 4th of July.
[00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:13.489]  It made me sick!
[00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:17.044]  And then I thought about the bill that almost passed in Texas.
[00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:18.807]  Some states have banned them.
[00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:22.831]  A bill that almost passed to ban fireworks.
[00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:30.961]  How Estes Rockets, little rocket kits you buy as a kid, that I did with my father, about to be out of business because they can't ship their rockets to people.
[00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:32.623]  Has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:12:32.663 --> 00:12:33.344]  They don't care.
[00:12:34.614 --> 00:12:38.637]  I thought about our jobs shutting down and our factories leaving our shores forever.
[00:12:38.698 --> 00:12:44.462]  I thought about how the number one part of our economy is giant prisons and law enforcement and security and surveillance.
[00:12:44.943 --> 00:12:48.646]  I thought about the Pentagon announcing that everything we do will be watched and tracked.
[00:12:49.126 --> 00:12:53.170]  I thought about how they're getting rid of posse comitatus and bringing in foreign troops.
[00:12:53.766 --> 00:13:04.719]  I thought about the forced inoculation plans and the new $6.3 billion federal bureaucracy yearly called BioShield to forcibly inoculate you and to build the giant infrastructures.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.202]  And I got very angry.
[00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:12.087]  But for those two and a half, three hours I was shooting fireworks off, I kind of forgot about it.
[00:13:14.867 --> 00:13:16.248]  You know, sometimes I get tired.
[00:13:16.308 --> 00:13:28.377]  Sometimes I, just for a few seconds, will lose the fire, the will, and the desire to get on the radio and to do interviews morning, noon, and night, and to do my own syndicated show.
[00:13:28.437 --> 00:13:38.725]  And I sometimes lose the fire to make a new documentary film, or I lose the fire in my belly to sit there for hours every night reading news stories on the news wires.
[00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:47.529]  But I always get the fire back if I just turn on CNN or Fox or if I listen to talk radio.
[00:13:48.931 --> 00:14:00.203]  And yesterday I went over to News Talk 1260, KWNX, the great affiliate that picks up my show here in Austin, and I
[00:14:00.953 --> 00:14:16.785]  I drove over there, met with the great folks, we talked about the New World Order, people shared news stories with me, I had great discussions with them, and then I get back in my car and I'm listening to that station and I flip over to see what the other station's doing.
[00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:23.350]  And, stuck in traffic, I listened to 30 minutes of the host
[00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:26.561]  Saying that every child needs vaccines.
[00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:28.763]  It should be illegal not to take vaccines.
[00:14:29.183 --> 00:14:31.905]  Everybody should be forced to take all the new vaccines.
[00:14:31.925 --> 00:14:33.286]  This is on the other station.
[00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:41.293]  And how wonderful the vaccines are and how there's all these conspiracy theorists that think vaccines are bad for you.
[00:14:41.373 --> 00:14:44.556]  And so I said, you know, I'm going to call into this station.
[00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.157]  And of course, everybody knows my voice.
[00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:53.718]  And I can successfully call into some local stations if I call in and go, yes, I'd like to talk to the host, please.
[00:14:53.758 --> 00:14:57.500]  You know, a lot of folks talk like this in Central Texas, so I can get on the air.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:04.225]  So I called in and I said, I'd like to disagree with the host about the story he's reading.
[00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:07.868]  And the call screen goes, what do you want to discuss?
[00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:16.500]  And I said, well, I want to talk about, and of course in the fake voice, well, because they know it's me, I won't get on the air.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.182]  Well, I'd like to discuss, bring up that he's saying there's no danger to vaccines.
[00:15:21.242 --> 00:15:29.565]  It's admitted that SV40 in many of the vaccines, not just the polio vaccine, is a dangerous cancer-causing virus.
[00:15:29.605 --> 00:15:32.026]  They admit it's caused all these new forms of cancer.
[00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:35.967]  This was admitted by major medical establishments, University of Chicago.
[00:15:35.987 --> 00:15:38.008]  And guess what else?
[00:15:38.806 --> 00:15:49.991]  And I said, well, uh, I said, autism's up 2000% and some of it could be misdiagnosis or more diagnosis, but a lot of it is, has been proven to the additives of the vaccine.
[00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:57.455]  They've admitted that George Bush had the vaccine record sealed and tried to sign an executive order and then passed a law that got repealed by the way.
[00:15:57.495 --> 00:16:01.377]  I didn't tell him that part, uh, last year guarding the vaccine makers.
[00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:04.678]  So I said this to him and of course I had something cogent to say.
[00:16:04.718 --> 00:16:05.919]  And he said, Nope, I'm sorry.
[00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:06.759]  We're not going to let you on the air.
[00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:08.040]  And I said, why not?
[00:16:08.755 --> 00:16:11.236]  And he said, well, I just don't agree with what you're saying.
[00:16:12.216 --> 00:16:13.617]  And I said, but it doesn't matter if you agree.
[00:16:13.677 --> 00:16:15.817]  It doesn't matter if you agree with what I'm saying, sir.
[00:16:15.837 --> 00:16:16.978]  I'd like a chance to talk.
[00:16:16.998 --> 00:16:18.218]  And he said, nope.
[00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:21.639]  And I said, so there's no free speech on this station.
[00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:24.980]  Now, understand, I'm not talking about News Talk 1260 KWNX.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.981]  I'm talking about this other station owned by the President's family.
[00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:32.202]  The President from Austin will just say that.
[00:16:32.562 --> 00:16:34.803]  But that, by the way, just got sold to a big conglomerate.
[00:16:36.404 --> 00:16:40.646]  They've always been totally New World Order, Neocon, you know, liberal stuff on the slide.
[00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.706]  They're owned by Democrats.
[00:16:42.687 --> 00:16:43.747]  Yellow Dog Democrats.
[00:16:43.787 --> 00:16:44.628]  Big government types.
[00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:49.570]  And so I say to him, I said, so there's no First Amendment on your station?
[00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.570]  He goes, that's right.
[00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.211]  And slammed the phone down.
[00:16:52.231 --> 00:16:59.033]  So I then get on the phone, all three or four people, including my wife, and guess what?
[00:16:59.374 --> 00:17:01.134]  He wouldn't let any of them on.
[00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:02.955]  And every caller but one.
[00:17:02.975 --> 00:17:04.336]  I mean, they probably took 15 calls.
[00:17:05.783 --> 00:17:06.604]  Said it's bad.
[00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:07.985]  Everybody should be vaccinated.
[00:17:08.025 --> 00:17:08.605]  It's wrong.
[00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:09.546]  People are coots.
[00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:15.511]  And I heard the host on air going, well, see, everybody's against this.
[00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.613]  Wonder why the legislature passed a law.
[00:17:17.633 --> 00:17:19.034]  Because I'll tell you about the law in a second.
[00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:20.215]  That's how this all got started.
[00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:22.477]  So there is censorship, folks.
[00:17:22.797 --> 00:17:24.158]  Acting like it's free speech.
[00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.340]  Acting like this is what the people want to hear.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.562]  And I'd heard this about this station for years.
[00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:29.863]  I haven't really tried to call in much.
[00:17:30.243 --> 00:17:32.385]  But I never get on the air there.
[00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:34.527]  If you disagree with them,
[00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:38.194]  Frankly, folks, you have to lie to get on these talk shows.
[00:17:38.214 --> 00:17:42.465]  You have to call in and say you agree with them, and then they'll let you on.
[00:17:43.422 --> 00:17:45.164]  And it's even worse on national shows.
[00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.925]  I've called them national shows.
[00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:48.447]  Never get on.
[00:17:48.627 --> 00:17:52.770]  I guess I've been able to call it on a financial show and frankly lie.
[00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:54.132]  And this is a war.
[00:17:54.232 --> 00:17:55.192]  I'm not into lying.
[00:17:55.553 --> 00:17:56.754]  I've had questions of that.
[00:17:57.134 --> 00:17:58.315]  You know, is that proper?
[00:17:59.216 --> 00:18:00.958]  But I guess I really don't lie.
[00:18:00.998 --> 00:18:06.202]  I'll just kind of talk about some other side issue, get on, talk about that issue, and then branch off.
[00:18:06.683 --> 00:18:08.945]  But I have asked the listeners, you know, do you think that's ethical?
[00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:09.605]  Some have said no.
[00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:10.306]  Some have said yes.
[00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:13.206]  But here I am on the air talking about it.
[00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:15.248]  But it's like being a spy in a war.
[00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:17.210]  They're the liars.
[00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.553]  They're the corrupt people holding out that it's the First Amendment.
[00:18:21.614 --> 00:18:22.715]  And it's not the First Amendment.
[00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:26.358]  It's all about censorship and crafting a view.
[00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:31.423]  Now, if you sound like an incoherent idiot, I've tested this before and disagree with them.
[00:18:31.763 --> 00:18:32.704]  They'll let you on.
[00:18:33.453 --> 00:18:42.459]  But if you don't agree with them, or you don't sound like an incoherent idiot, some dumb liberal they can slap around, or some dumb neocon they can slap around, they won't have you on.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.682]  And, you know, I've called into a lot of national shows and had this happen.
[00:18:46.702 --> 00:18:49.323]  You know, I've been on road trips and tried for an hour to get through.
[00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:53.426]  You get through, you get on, you get to the call screener, and they hang up on you.
[00:18:55.047 --> 00:18:56.608]  So what does that say about America?
[00:18:57.348 --> 00:18:59.630]  A very serious question for everybody out there.
[00:19:00.562 --> 00:19:06.046]  Here is an article out of the Dallas Morning News yesterday that they were talking about on this local talk show.
[00:19:06.487 --> 00:19:08.989]  Law lets kids forego vaccines.
[00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:11.451]  Critics worry about health and schools.
[00:19:11.571 --> 00:19:12.692]  Others applaud choice.
[00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:13.352]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:19:14.373 --> 00:19:16.675]  It was already a law that you couldn't make a kid take a shot.
[00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:26.182]  The article acts like there was a law where you had to, but what the new law actually does is it says CPS can't come after you, because I went and got the law yesterday.
[00:19:27.723 --> 00:19:28.383]  And they passed it.
[00:19:28.423 --> 00:19:28.984]  I commend them.
[00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:34.130]  Because of pressure that a lot of our listeners, I remember our listeners were pushing for this, brought to bear.
[00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:36.252]  The Vaccine Awareness Network and others.
[00:19:37.852 --> 00:19:39.333]  So that's what the new law does.
[00:19:39.393 --> 00:19:40.434]  They would come after you.
[00:19:40.774 --> 00:19:42.495]  There was no law, they would still come after you.
[00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:44.836]  Well now, it says CPS can't do that.
[00:19:44.876 --> 00:19:45.937]  Now you know they're still going to do it.
[00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:52.627]  So when we get back, I'll tell you about this law in Texas that you need to have in your state.
[00:19:53.667 --> 00:20:00.549]  And then the staged event I watched unfold on talk radio here locally.
[00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.190]  It's disgusting!
[00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.752]  But I do have to say that News Talk 1260, KWNX, will not censor you.
[00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:07.852]  I'll be right back.
[00:20:09.938 --> 00:20:10.158]  Berkey.
[00:20:10.358 --> 00:20:14.240]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.922]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:20.202 --> 00:20:30.566]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:35.068]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:35.248 --> 00:20:43.609]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:50.271]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:20:50.371 --> 00:20:54.851]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:55.051 --> 00:20:59.272]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:46.252]  I think so.
[00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:15.372]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:23:15.753 --> 00:23:19.838]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:27.567]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:23:28.107 --> 00:23:35.430]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.031]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:23:38.371 --> 00:23:41.632]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:23:42.032 --> 00:23:45.194]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:23:45.474 --> 00:23:48.375]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.

[00:24:21.121 --> 00:24:25.063]  Folks, if you want to take vaccines, go ahead and knock yourselves out.
[00:24:25.403 --> 00:24:31.507]  You know, I have said that it's your choice.
[00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.088]  Do it if you want to.
[00:24:33.168 --> 00:24:34.548]  Don't do it if you don't want to.
[00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:41.812]  Vaccines, if they were produced properly by trustworthy organizations, not eugenics-obsessed Nazis.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.441]  Publicly funding extermination programs worldwide against the third world and being caught doing it to the vaccines.
[00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:53.942]  Official government plans, Australian, US, Canadian, British, to do this.
[00:24:55.782 --> 00:25:09.165]  We didn't have all the reports, the mercury and the microplasms and the cancer viruses and the weird hormones and the UN getting caught sterilizing women with a tetanus shot that had a hormone added.
[00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:10.565]  I mean, this is all admitted!
[00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:19.295]  But yeah, we have companies that can be trusted in four or five groups, independently tested the vaccine lots, and yes, vaccines can be a good thing.
[00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:22.216]  You can give yourself an immunity.
[00:25:23.757 --> 00:25:26.959]  But there's no substitute for being healthy.
[00:25:27.639 --> 00:25:30.981]  But certainly, vaccines can be a good thing, but they shouldn't be mandatory.
[00:25:32.902 --> 00:25:37.665]  And we've got a government that's trying to make dozens of new ones every year mandatory.
[00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:43.709]  In fact, there was an article last week about how they want, now, a whole new class of shots to be given.
[00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:46.491]  They're talking about making an anti-smoking vaccine mandatory.
[00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:49.392]  They were talking about making an Alzheimer's vaccine mandatory.
[00:25:49.412 --> 00:25:53.475]  If they could get approval, then it killed a bunch of the people that took it, so they backed off.
[00:25:54.224 --> 00:25:58.486]  They used to give kids before the age of two shots in Japan.
[00:25:58.546 --> 00:26:00.787]  Now they made a law where you can't do it in Japan.
[00:26:01.147 --> 00:26:03.128]  It killed and brain damaged so many children.
[00:26:03.388 --> 00:26:06.509]  They didn't have cases of autism that were known!
[00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:33.144]  uh... in uh... japan and now they do and their government freaked out and said no autism was unheard of it was it was an unknown thing just a few decades ago now it's all over the place you go to the mall you see kids all over the place nodding their heads twiddling their fingers in front of their faces this is real people and I wanted to call into the show and I also wanted to make the point you know while I'm sitting there
[00:26:34.436 --> 00:26:37.118]  ...on hold before they came and screened my call and wouldn't let me on the air.
[00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:46.345]  I was thinking, hey, I'll point out that if we're all kooks, why did 99 plus percent of doctors and medical workers and police and firemen refuse a smallpox shot?
[00:26:46.886 --> 00:26:55.132]  Why did the government have to suspend the experimental anthrax shot they gave the troops, now admittedly killing a bunch of them and injuring many others?
[00:26:56.093 --> 00:26:57.374]  This is all confirmed stuff!
[00:26:59.244 --> 00:27:00.525]  We cannot just sit here and ignore it.
[00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:03.606]  And yes, if you don't give your kids inoculations, they could get something.
[00:27:03.626 --> 00:27:04.346]  They could get sick.
[00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:14.751]  Especially if you've got them in these daycares, which is insane, with all the, you know, the big disease factory, because all the kids are on antibiotics, that only the superbacteria survive.
[00:27:15.471 --> 00:27:18.533]  It's like sick building syndrome, or sick hospital syndrome.
[00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:21.794]  You know, they always find the flesh-eating bacteria in the hospital.
[00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:31.268]  Because they're the most immune in that environment of vaccines and in that environment of all the antibiotics over-prescribed.
[00:27:31.288 --> 00:27:32.789]  You've got super bugs there!
[00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:40.794]  Every time somebody gets flesh-eating bacteria, you know, they're in the army and they give people shots with the same needles out of those guns they claim are safe.
[00:27:41.294 --> 00:27:42.235]  And they're not, folks!
[00:27:42.275 --> 00:27:45.517]  I've given cows shots with them and it does not work.
[00:27:45.877 --> 00:27:49.019]  Those multiple shot systems do not work like they say they do.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.160]  And you get blood all over it.
[00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:56.403]  Remember two of the guys in the same unit got the flesh-eating bacteria?
[00:27:56.503 --> 00:27:57.604]  One died in the Marines.
[00:27:57.624 --> 00:27:58.785]  You know, you always hear about that.
[00:27:59.085 --> 00:28:01.587]  Well, this stuff just breeds in daycares and hospitals.
[00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:06.350]  So yeah, I mean, if you're going to have your kid in daycare, you're going to do that.
[00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.070]  Had to do that.
[00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:12.734]  And the vaccines were safer, maybe, but not with the track record of who's running this.
[00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:15.195]  And so I wanted to say that.
[00:28:15.255 --> 00:28:17.637]  I wanted to warn the people, but no!
[00:28:18.457 --> 00:28:20.699]  So I wanted to find out if they were screening everybody.
[00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:23.402]  Because every caller, you know, they took like 15 calls.
[00:28:23.422 --> 00:28:27.504]  They let one person in who was, who was against it, who sounded like an incoherent idiot.
[00:28:27.524 --> 00:28:28.404]  That's why they let him on.
[00:28:28.904 --> 00:28:33.506]  So I called, what, four people and they all called and none of them could get through or get on the air.
[00:28:35.427 --> 00:28:36.868]  The call screener would tell them no.
[00:28:37.995 --> 00:28:40.976]  So that's what even these local stations are doing.
[00:28:41.496 --> 00:28:43.317]  So here's what they were talking about on the station.
[00:28:43.777 --> 00:28:45.817]  Law lets kids forgo vaccines.
[00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:47.878]  Critics worry about health and schools.
[00:28:47.998 --> 00:28:49.038]  Others applaud choice.
[00:28:49.479 --> 00:29:01.862]  A new Texas law that will allow unvaccinated children to attend public schools and daycare centers if their parents philosophically object to state immunization requirements has alarmed pediatricians and public health experts.
[00:29:02.322 --> 00:29:06.964]  The new measure, which was tacked to a mammoth health and human services reorganization bill,
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.621]  Well, that's been there forever.
[00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:11.902]  This is what's new in the law right here.
[00:29:11.982 --> 00:29:13.423]  That's the new law.
[00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:40.037]  But of course, B-Lobe, New World Order, Dallas Morning News doesn't tell you that.
[00:29:40.277 --> 00:29:41.257]  They bury it in the article.
[00:29:42.978 --> 00:29:44.319]  I'll get to some global news.
[00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:45.159]  There's a bunch of it.
[00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:46.159]  It's all really important.
[00:29:46.179 --> 00:29:50.781]  We got Paul Joseph Watson, webmaster for prisonplanet.com and a great new author.
[00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:54.143]  One of the only people to read his new book because it's not published yet.
[00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:56.384]  He's joining us.
[00:29:56.404 --> 00:29:57.544]  You don't want to miss this interview.
[00:29:57.604 --> 00:29:58.645]  Just stay with us.
[00:30:00.086 --> 00:30:00.986]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.987]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.975 --> 00:30:06.737]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:10.939]  Are you propello folks?
[00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:13.900]  Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.662]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:30:17.742 --> 00:30:25.406]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in... ...wise cream to receive your free jar of this fast acting pain relieving formulation.
[00:30:25.526 --> 00:30:25.846]  Call 1-800-643-9558 today.
[00:30:35.619 --> 00:31:04.507]  Earlier in the hour I talked about how I was having this discussion during the break with two brothers that work at the network as we were trying to one-up each other on who had the most fireworks this 4th of July and Mark was informing me later that actually in Minnesota you can't shoot off fireworks so a lot of folks go to the border to Wisconsin
[00:31:05.433 --> 00:31:07.654]  And of course, being law-abiding, that's of course what they did.
[00:31:07.734 --> 00:31:13.296]  But he did point out that people just ignore it in wholesale mass in the state.
[00:31:14.356 --> 00:31:15.537]  And that happens in Austin.
[00:31:15.657 --> 00:31:18.118]  Inside Austin, you're not allowed to shoot fireworks off.
[00:31:19.258 --> 00:31:20.999]  Because, you know, they've got all their reasons for it.
[00:31:21.019 --> 00:31:22.319]  It could set a fire or whatever.
[00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:26.761]  But as long as you're not endangering somebody or it's rained, I don't see there being a problem with it.
[00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:27.521]  And I know this.
[00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:31.423]  I've been right out in my front yard shooting artillery shells off before.
[00:31:31.443 --> 00:31:32.323]  Ooh, I'm admitting it.
[00:31:32.987 --> 00:31:35.769]  Probably going to... on the radio.
[00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.411]  But I've had police drive by and wave at me.
[00:31:38.431 --> 00:31:40.833]  You know, it's just some laws people just ignore.
[00:31:41.334 --> 00:31:43.635]  It's like the government said that everybody had to take a shot.
[00:31:43.816 --> 00:31:44.716]  A smallpox shot.
[00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:48.419]  The police and military and doctors and others.
[00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:53.243]  Well, the only people they can make take the shot, the smallpox shot, is the military because they're a captive audience.
[00:31:53.263 --> 00:31:54.564]  But I don't think they should have to take it.
[00:31:55.265 --> 00:31:56.566]  And they just refuse to take it.
[00:31:56.606 --> 00:31:59.928]  The police and firefighters and doctors.
[00:32:00.048 --> 00:32:01.850]  Because they know how dangerous it was.
[00:32:02.495 --> 00:32:05.215]  The evidence showed it was more dangerous than what the Feds had said.
[00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:09.116]  So, again, the New World Order can give its orders.
[00:32:09.196 --> 00:32:14.377]  The question is, are people going to follow those orders?
[00:32:16.057 --> 00:32:28.239]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to our guest, and then I'm going to get to, before this hour ends, Andy and Peter and Dan and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:31.540]  I do want to challenge all the listeners to get my book,
[00:32:33.398 --> 00:32:45.449]  9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, maybe you've already gotten Descent into Tyranny, the book, or the film, Road to Tyranny, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, or perhaps you've already gotten Police State 2000, or The Takeover, or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:50.411]  The question is, have you made copies of those videos yet to give them to friends and family?
[00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:52.232]  To air them on AXS TV?
[00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:57.515]  Have you given them to your sheriff, your police chief, your county commissioners, your city councilwomen and men?
[00:32:58.055 --> 00:32:59.235]  Have you taken action?
[00:32:59.295 --> 00:33:12.482]  Have you gotten involved in the Info War to expose this alien government we have, alien to the American way of life, alien to our republic that is destroying our liberties and freedoms and setting up a high-tech police state?
[00:33:13.812 --> 00:33:17.555]  But hey, a lot of people would appreciate getting an original video.
[00:33:17.635 --> 00:33:26.701]  Why not give Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, or Police State 3, Total Enslavement, or my book, The Sentence to Tyranny, as a gift?
[00:33:28.082 --> 00:33:36.048]  The book is 230 pages, only $12, and it covers what really happened on September 11th and who stands to gain.
[00:33:36.108 --> 00:33:43.193]  You see the government needed a crisis to convince the people who willingly give up their liberty in exchange for safety, as if you get safety when you give up liberty.
[00:33:44.341 --> 00:33:45.462]  Now the painful facts are in.
[00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:49.485]  The dark forces of global government are funding, training, and protecting terrorist networks worldwide.
[00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:56.410]  9-1-1 dissent to tyranny documents the ruthless history of governments orchestrating terrorist attacks against their own people to scare them to total submission.
[00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.514]  And this brutal expose will witness the birth of a global police state that surpasses Orwell's nightmare vision.
[00:34:01.554 --> 00:34:02.194]  It's all here.
[00:34:02.575 --> 00:34:08.739]  The history of government-sponsored terrorism, the modern implementation of fear-based control, the most frightening of all, the New World Order's future plans.
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.901]  This is one book you cannot afford to ignore.
[00:34:10.961 --> 00:34:13.663]  The future of free people everywhere is at stake.
[00:34:14.458 --> 00:34:15.480]  Get Descent into Tyranny.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.662]  But get Road to Tyranny, the film.
[00:34:17.782 --> 00:34:19.885]  Get Masters of Terror, Part 2 of the Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:22.148]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:34:22.628 --> 00:34:25.192]  When you order three or more of any of the nine videos...
[00:34:26.047 --> 00:34:28.670]  They drop down to $20 a piece from $25.95.
[00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:30.631]  That's a big discount.
[00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:36.237]  An $18 discount on the 3-tape special, $24 discount on the 4-tape special, and so on.
[00:34:36.837 --> 00:34:47.027]  And you support this broadcast and help us expand our operations, hire more employees, do a better job, so I can work 16 hours a day instead of 18 or 20 hours a day.
[00:34:50.462 --> 00:34:59.026]  So, please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get the videos, get the book, or call toll-free to order them at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:59.046 --> 00:34:59.626]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:34:59.646 --> 00:35:03.628]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R,
[00:35:17.074 --> 00:35:20.616]  Sweet 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:22.357 --> 00:35:23.878]  Take action today.
[00:35:24.438 --> 00:35:25.398]  Get the videos.
[00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:35.124]  Expose the liar system, the neocon liars, the liberal liars, all serving and feeding at the trough of the New World Order at your expense.
[00:35:35.164 --> 00:35:35.824]  Get the films.
[00:35:36.164 --> 00:35:37.265]  Start the Info War.
[00:35:37.405 --> 00:35:38.845]  Man the guns in the Info War.
[00:35:39.326 --> 00:35:40.146]  Now, folks.
[00:35:40.546 --> 00:35:41.227]  Take action.
[00:35:41.247 --> 00:35:41.287]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:52.113]  Now, uh, Andy and, uh, again, Peter and Dan and others that are holding, they're gonna get to your calls.
[00:35:52.153 --> 00:35:53.414]  And we don't screen your calls.
[00:35:54.014 --> 00:35:58.595]  We don't, uh, censor people like the neocons and the liberals.
[00:35:59.455 --> 00:36:03.156]  We tell the truth and can defend ourselves because we have the facts.
[00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:15.419]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson, I became aware of his work a couple years ago when he started, uh, Propagandamatrix.com, and I don't work with a lot of people because
[00:36:16.684 --> 00:36:20.967]  A lot of folks get off into conspiracy theories, things they can't prove.
[00:36:21.027 --> 00:36:22.088]  They're leftward leaning.
[00:36:22.128 --> 00:36:23.269]  They're rightward leaning.
[00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:25.230]  They're not constitutionalists.
[00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.291]  They don't have a grasp of history.
[00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:38.299]  They don't understand the manipulation and a full field view of the paradigm to see the lies, the different tricks they play in paradigm management, in psychological warfare.
[00:36:38.982 --> 00:36:46.047]  Paul Watson has a great grasp of this, and we think along very similar lines, which is a rarity, unfortunately.
[00:36:46.487 --> 00:37:05.019]  So I got Watson to start with our help, prisonplanet.com, and it has now gone, in just the last year, to being in the top 1% of patriot, conservative, constitutionalist websites.
[00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:15.960]  It is as big as Infowars.com was a year ago, only a year into its existence, and now Infowars.com has raced up the charts.
[00:37:17.158 --> 00:37:24.540]  Up there into the very highest percentile now with just a few dozen websites ahead of us that cover similar information.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.841]  With tens of millions of visitors per month to both the websites.
[00:37:28.901 --> 00:37:29.862]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:37:30.242 --> 00:37:34.703]  I'm giving you a status report out there on the front lines that our message is winning.
[00:37:35.203 --> 00:37:41.765]  That our war against the New World Order is very successful and that you can become leaders in this fight as well.
[00:37:42.325 --> 00:37:54.454]  But only in our little corner of the world we're having massive effect and there are tens of thousands of people fighting in a big way and millions fighting in small ways and together we're moving mountains.
[00:37:55.074 --> 00:37:58.576]  Most Americans now have heard the government carried out 9-1-1.
[00:37:58.977 --> 00:38:03.460]  Many Americans have investigated it and found out that it is in fact the truth.
[00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:15.177]  And just like Galileo was a kook for saying the world was round, just a decade later after his death, people, most people knew that it was round, and you were a kook to say it was flat.
[00:38:15.658 --> 00:38:27.824]  So, joining us is another radical, a man who believes the world is round, and believes the sun comes up in the morning, and believes government is corrupt, and needs to be watched and contained, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:38:28.104 --> 00:38:30.105]  Paul, thanks for joining us from the United Kingdom.
[00:38:30.706 --> 00:38:31.227]  Hello, Alex.
[00:38:31.347 --> 00:38:32.427]  Great to be on the air today.
[00:38:33.008 --> 00:38:33.368]  You bet.
[00:38:33.388 --> 00:38:34.289]  You like that introduction?
[00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.271]  Yeah, very good.
[00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:38.112]  It's an accurate introduction, my friend.
[00:38:38.272 --> 00:38:40.314]  So you better watch what I say.
[00:38:40.394 --> 00:38:40.614]  I know.
[00:38:40.634 --> 00:38:41.535]  You're doing a great job.
[00:38:42.276 --> 00:38:49.121]  Paul, tell us about briefly how you woke up to the new world order, why you started your website, what we do at Prison Planet.
[00:38:49.141 --> 00:38:56.647]  Then let's talk about the news coming out in England and the death camps, the national ID cards, the gun confiscation.
[00:38:59.426 --> 00:39:01.448]  What's developing with the police state there?
[00:39:01.488 --> 00:39:04.431]  And then I want to get into the weapons of mass destruction and 9-1-1.
[00:39:04.471 --> 00:39:06.713]  But first off, what woke up?
[00:39:07.293 --> 00:39:10.837]  What turned the lightbulb on in Paul Joseph Watson's brain?
[00:39:11.857 --> 00:39:16.261]  Well, this ties into something you were discussing just a few minutes ago, actually.
[00:39:17.663 --> 00:39:20.946]  The idea of paradigm management or paradigm control.
[00:39:22.687 --> 00:39:34.252]  Basically, I woke up to the New World Order by realising that both left and right were controlled because originally I got into politics in the first place through the liberal channel, basically.
[00:39:34.892 --> 00:39:45.536]  Then I started to read some books which proved that both the left and the right were controlled, especially in relation to the biggest example that we can provide, which is the Cold War.
[00:39:47.597 --> 00:39:50.998]  Obviously, we know the work of Anthony Sutton, who's done a great job
[00:39:51.836 --> 00:39:59.922]  Now deceased, sadly, but he did a great job in exposing the fact that the Communists were actually funded from New York by the Capitalists.
[00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:19.257]  And I've got, just recently found an article, which hasn't been online or anywhere that I've seen, and it's way back in 1959, and it's from the Wisconsin Daily Journal, and the title of the article is, Kozlov leaving California for chilly Detroit.
[00:40:20.268 --> 00:40:33.775]  And it's an Associated Press article, and it goes on to explain how Kozlov, Romanovich Kozlov, who was Khrushchev's right-hand man, was invited in 1959 to Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:34.355 --> 00:40:37.137]  Obviously, your listeners are well aware of Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:37.837 --> 00:40:43.280]  And the quote in this Associated Press article is that he was wined and dined by the capitalists.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.442]  And Kozlov actually stated that
[00:40:49.234 --> 00:40:53.216]  Into the first day of his trip, saying, business will be good, is the quote.
[00:40:53.817 --> 00:40:56.439]  And he was obviously discussing this with the capitalists.
[00:40:56.479 --> 00:41:03.984]  So we have Cruz Chess, right-hand man at the height of the Cold War, meeting with New York bankers at Bohemian Grove.
[00:41:04.324 --> 00:41:06.846]  Now, Paul, you told me about that about two weeks ago.
[00:41:06.866 --> 00:41:08.688]  Have we posted that yet on Prison Planet?
[00:41:09.468 --> 00:41:17.394]  Not yet, no, but in a few days or a week maximum, I will have a full article on that with a link to the original newspaper article.
[00:41:18.126 --> 00:41:19.247]  Well, that's fantastic.
[00:41:19.307 --> 00:41:34.633]  Now, continuing this line of discussion, and we're going to go to some calls and back into news, it's admitted that the Red Cross was used to bring 25 million in gold bullion, the equivalent of a billion at the time, when Lennon was about to fail in 1917.
[00:41:35.834 --> 00:41:40.316]  We know that I was watching the History Channel a couple years ago and almost fell out of my chair.
[00:41:40.356 --> 00:41:42.817]  They have the old CIA section chief, he was like 85 at the time now,
[00:41:44.392 --> 00:41:46.994]  He's bragging that, yeah, we actually put Mao into power.
[00:41:47.034 --> 00:41:49.015]  We thought it was a greater stabilizing effect.
[00:41:49.795 --> 00:41:53.978]  And then I have got CBS Classics off the CBS Classics channel.
[00:41:54.038 --> 00:41:55.159]  I don't have it on my cable.
[00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.660]  A listener mailed it to me.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:07.106]  It's got McCarthy, right before he got burned, going, I have discovered that there is a global system, that there's a group above the communists, that the army is funding the communists.
[00:42:07.646 --> 00:42:13.373]  And that's when they all turned against McCarthy, and now the KGB files, the East German Stasi files have come out.
[00:42:13.793 --> 00:42:17.417]  Turns out it was, in fact, the Wall Street Journal reported, quote, McCarthy was right.
[00:42:17.437 --> 00:42:17.797]  The L.A.
[00:42:17.837 --> 00:42:20.500]  Times wrote an article a few months ago, McCarthy was right.
[00:42:21.301 --> 00:42:23.283]  It turns out it was worse than what McCarthy thought.
[00:42:23.584 --> 00:42:28.469]  They were using him to help set up a police state, going after people that really weren't communist, just leftist.
[00:42:29.204 --> 00:42:35.110]  And when he found out that the bankers were funding it, and there was a group above the communists, that's when they torpedoed him.
[00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:43.418]  He was a darling with Nixon and Eisenhower and all these guys until he found out the truth, and then he was destroyed politically.
[00:42:43.518 --> 00:42:45.320]  So, that's a fact.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:52.427]  I mean, during the Cold War, it was the Rockefellers and others that were funding, and Uncle Joe Stalin in our newspapers.
[00:42:53.587 --> 00:43:04.596]  The National Post of Canada, three weeks ago, the headline, The Ghost of Trotsky Walks the Halls of the White House, and it mentioned that all the neocon leaders, their fathers were all top Trotskyites.
[00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:10.981]  William Kristol's father was the head of the Communist Fourth International in this country.
[00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:14.224]  I mean, Paul, you can't make stuff up, it's so bizarre.
[00:43:14.504 --> 00:43:15.345]  Any comments to that?
[00:43:17.652 --> 00:43:22.035]  That's the main thrust of what we try to expose, the fact that both left and right are controlled.
[00:43:22.735 --> 00:43:28.278]  And in the news, it's not just a liberal bias, it's either a liberal bias or a neocon bias.
[00:43:28.298 --> 00:43:31.079]  The bottom line is that it's a bias.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:39.624]  Actually, I read today some excerpts from one of Anthony Sutton's books, who was the main exposer of this false paradigm.
[00:43:40.807 --> 00:43:52.177]  He was talking about the Hegelian dialectic and how left was played against right not just during the Cold War but afterwards to ensue that this would happen.
[00:43:53.338 --> 00:44:02.266]  I mean what it boils down to today is that you can be against illegal immigration but then you have to be pro-war or you can be
[00:44:03.155 --> 00:44:03.855]  I don't think so.
[00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:19.721]  We're good to go.
[00:44:42.995 --> 00:44:44.476]  Well, that's the point.
[00:44:44.596 --> 00:44:57.067]  And the fact is that before the war actually started, all the left-wing so-called alternative media websites were calling for anti-war protesters to wave the UN flag as they marched.
[00:44:57.767 --> 00:45:06.254]  And the UN and the Americans and the Germans and the French, their solution to avoiding the war was full-scale UN occupation anyway.
[00:45:06.314 --> 00:45:09.297]  So the end result was basically the same system.
[00:45:10.277 --> 00:45:10.818]  Exactly.
[00:45:10.878 --> 00:45:13.781]  It's what brigade of Caesar's troops will be there.
[00:45:14.361 --> 00:45:17.645]  And then, now America and England play the part as the bad cops.
[00:45:17.665 --> 00:45:19.166]  We've always been the good guys before.
[00:45:19.546 --> 00:45:23.811]  In world opinion, making Russia, China and the EU look like the good guys.
[00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:25.012]  Empowering them.
[00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:27.995]  Everybody dumps a dollar in the pound and goes to the Euro.
[00:45:28.896 --> 00:45:33.720]  Well yeah, and basically they used liberal organizations like the UN.
[00:45:34.953 --> 00:45:36.835]  Uh, they use them as sort of batteries.
[00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:43.583]  I mean, the call now is to replace the UN in left-wing circles because it was ineffective in preventing the war.
[00:45:44.144 --> 00:45:49.149]  And so left-wingers are calling for the UN to be replaced by a de facto world government.
[00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:51.612]  So we see the overarching structure is...
[00:45:51.752 --> 00:45:52.052]  The U.N.
[00:45:52.072 --> 00:45:59.417]  was always meant to be folded into NATO, IMF, World Bank, OECD, World Trade Organization, World Health Organization.
[00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:00.778]  Those bodies have already been set up.
[00:46:00.798 --> 00:46:04.461]  And the CFR, five years ago, was calling for, quote, getting rid of the U.N.
[00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:05.341]  and restructuring it.
[00:46:06.442 --> 00:46:08.864]  And then conservatives see liberals against a war.
[00:46:09.024 --> 00:46:11.766]  They know the liberals are bad, so they think, oh, the war must be good.
[00:46:12.126 --> 00:46:13.907]  Again, that's how paradigm management works.
[00:46:14.307 --> 00:46:17.670]  When actually, Bill Clinton wanted to go into Iraq, Bill Clinton went into Serbia.
[00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:21.012]  Bill Clinton went into all these countries, too, but they were for it then, weren't they?
[00:46:22.188 --> 00:46:22.868]  Yeah, that's the point.
[00:46:22.928 --> 00:46:26.810]  And I've seen articles from people that were putting out good information.
[00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:37.735]  I mean, I won't name any names, but now those same people are writing voluminous articles praising the virtues of John Kerry and how the Democrats will save us.
[00:46:38.555 --> 00:46:43.257]  And John Kerry, like George Bush, is a member of Gull and Bones.
[00:46:43.758 --> 00:46:44.218]  So they don't...
[00:46:45.265 --> 00:46:52.509]  People who come out anti-war don't see the full perspective, and in the end their information becomes disinformation.
[00:46:52.629 --> 00:46:55.171]  Well, it's totally staged at the federal level, and we know that.
[00:46:55.251 --> 00:47:00.494]  Now, Paul, day one we've known that we've been being lied to.
[00:47:00.534 --> 00:47:05.096]  We know that the trucks were sold by the British, the so-called mobile bio-weapons trucks were sold by the British.
[00:47:06.117 --> 00:47:07.278]  They had the purchase order.
[00:47:07.298 --> 00:47:08.779]  The Iraqis said it day one.
[00:47:08.879 --> 00:47:11.080]  The UN had already been there and seen those trucks.
[00:47:11.764 --> 00:47:12.364]  But they don't care.
[00:47:12.404 --> 00:47:13.805]  They claim they were bioweapons labs.
[00:47:13.885 --> 00:47:15.446]  They claim those were mass graves.
[00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:18.908]  They knew it was a body exchange program from the Iran-Iraq war.
[00:47:19.688 --> 00:47:20.729]  The country of Niger.
[00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:24.430]  The White House knew months before that was a totally fake document.
[00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:25.111]  They didn't care.
[00:47:25.191 --> 00:47:26.351]  Talked about it in the State of the Union.
[00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:29.773]  Why do you think they lie and don't care if they get caught now?
[00:47:31.494 --> 00:47:35.196]  Well, tying into that, we've got the story today out of the Washington Post.
[00:47:35.296 --> 00:47:38.437]  White House backs off claim on Iraqi Bay.
[00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:47.301]  Basically, I mean, people have obviously heard of this before, but it's called externalization of the hierarchy.
[00:47:47.821 --> 00:47:49.542]  And this is what we see developing.
[00:47:49.602 --> 00:47:54.623]  The lies come out, but then they're just whitewashed, and people don't take any action of them.
[00:47:54.823 --> 00:48:05.306]  And that conditions you to accept more of a kind of a revelation of the method, and that makes people think we've still got a free press, but you notice this all comes out after the war, then there'll be a new war, and it'll come out after the war,
[00:48:06.287 --> 00:48:06.707]  Alex Jones.
[00:48:32.972 --> 00:48:38.921]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:48:39.141 --> 00:48:41.404]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:48:41.605 --> 00:48:47.954]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:48:48.334 --> 00:48:48.934]  I think so.
[00:49:09.141 --> 00:49:09.401]  I think so.
[00:49:31.952 --> 00:49:36.454]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:36.794 --> 00:49:40.876]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.176 --> 00:49:41.736]  We listened.
[00:49:42.037 --> 00:49:47.019]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.299 --> 00:49:47.779]  We listened.
[00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:51.201]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:52.161]  We listened.
[00:49:52.621 --> 00:49:56.163]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:49:56.283 --> 00:49:56.683]  I think so.
[00:50:23.508 --> 00:50:34.634]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:34.814 --> 00:50:39.257]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:43.759]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:43.799 --> 00:50:45.160]  The New World Order.
[00:50:46.935 --> 00:50:51.156]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:51.237 --> 00:50:58.160]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.281]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:01.681]  We're good to go.
[00:51:34.071 --> 00:51:34.571]  Don't worry.
[00:51:35.032 --> 00:51:36.572]  This show is documented.
[00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:39.854]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:40.234 --> 00:51:43.756]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:51:43.776 --> 00:51:48.319]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:51:48.819 --> 00:51:50.740]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.961]  Alright folks, I'm back live.
[00:51:53.281 --> 00:51:54.282]  Talking to Paul Watson.
[00:51:54.322 --> 00:51:55.342]  Paul, let's take some calls.
[00:51:55.382 --> 00:51:56.643]  You'll be with us the whole next hour.
[00:51:56.663 --> 00:51:57.944]  We'll have more time to get into more.
[00:51:58.704 --> 00:51:59.485]  Key analysis.
[00:51:59.505 --> 00:52:04.488]  This is really important information, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to really know what's going on in the world and want to be able to affect change.
[00:52:05.448 --> 00:52:07.830]  Andy in Ohio, then Peter, Dan, and others.
[00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.950]  Andy, you're on the air.
[00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.371]  Go ahead.
[00:52:09.731 --> 00:52:10.011]  Hi, Alex.
[00:52:10.051 --> 00:52:10.671]  Good to talk to you.
[00:52:11.232 --> 00:52:11.852]  Thanks for holding.
[00:52:11.892 --> 00:52:12.192]  Welcome.
[00:52:12.793 --> 00:52:13.633]  Thanks for keeping me on hold.
[00:52:13.653 --> 00:52:15.074]  My shortwave's not working good today.
[00:52:15.514 --> 00:52:15.895]  All right.
[00:52:15.935 --> 00:52:16.535]  Well, you're on the air.
[00:52:16.575 --> 00:52:16.915]  Go ahead.
[00:52:16.995 --> 00:52:17.255]  Okay.
[00:52:17.295 --> 00:52:18.776]  I'm really excited to talk to you, Paul.
[00:52:18.816 --> 00:52:24.820]  I look at your website every day, and I wanted to know what's going on with the radio show and the website.
[00:52:26.621 --> 00:52:28.562]  What happened to the radio show, did you say?
[00:52:29.362 --> 00:52:30.722]  Yeah, the radio show that you have on your website.
[00:52:30.742 --> 00:52:35.383]  Paul does a once-a-week radio show, and I think he's probably been so busy he hasn't had a chance to do it lately.
[00:52:35.443 --> 00:52:38.224]  Yeah, basically, I had to end that.
[00:52:38.344 --> 00:52:46.066]  I mean, it was getting thousands and thousands of listeners a day, but I just decided to concentrate on other things, but it may be back in the future.
[00:52:46.626 --> 00:52:48.407]  Okay, yeah, I really like the archives.
[00:52:48.427 --> 00:52:50.007]  The archives are really good on the website, too.
[00:52:50.827 --> 00:52:52.888]  And what's going on with Sea Silver?
[00:52:52.908 --> 00:52:53.828]  Are they going to be back open?
[00:52:57.332 --> 00:53:04.216]  For those that don't know, it's just simply a liquid vitamin and all they said is it's more absorbable than solid vitamins.
[00:53:04.256 --> 00:53:09.840]  The same stuff sold at the store and the feds are now, in Europe, they're banning vitamin C over the counter.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:16.184]  So this is a move everywhere to go after any real supplement that does a good job and I think that's just ridiculous.
[00:53:16.664 --> 00:53:17.865]  Anything else on your mind, Andy?
[00:53:19.366 --> 00:53:19.766]  Not much.
[00:53:21.368 --> 00:53:21.768]  All right.
[00:53:21.828 --> 00:53:22.908]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:53:22.948 --> 00:53:24.069]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:53:24.429 --> 00:53:26.769]  Let's talk to Peter in Florida.
[00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:27.530]  Peter, you're on the air.
[00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:27.990]  Go ahead.
[00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:29.390]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.850]  Thank you.
[00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:36.232]  In line with what we're talking about right now, I found something on the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:53:37.332 --> 00:53:37.952]  It's interesting.
[00:53:38.032 --> 00:53:44.054]  It says, at about the same time that Hegel was passing from the scene, Karl Marx caught the revolutionary fever.
[00:53:44.734 --> 00:53:49.115]  He drew heavily from Hegel, the dialectic, and Cherbon, materialism.
[00:53:49.761 --> 00:53:54.083]  He picked up where the other philosophers left the discussion, but with a twist.
[00:53:54.523 --> 00:54:00.126]  He scornfully stated that philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways.
[00:54:00.606 --> 00:54:06.689]  The point, however, is to change the world, was to become the warp and wolf of Marxism.
[00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:10.711]  In the Marxist interpretation of reality, God had to be abandoned.
[00:54:11.297 --> 00:54:16.259]  Alone in the universe, man was to fill the vacuum left by religion and materialism.
[00:54:16.279 --> 00:54:23.001]  Yeah, the communists basically were just the front for the bankers to con the people back into feudalism and served them.
[00:54:23.021 --> 00:54:28.443]  They hung a label of liberation on it and then funded it and then conned the masses back into it.
[00:54:28.463 --> 00:54:32.565]  So Marx and Lenin and all these guys were nothing but plagiars.
[00:54:32.885 --> 00:54:33.645]  Paul, any comments?
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:48.546]  Well, yeah, speaking about Marx, that again ties into how I woke up to the whole system, because when I went to university about two years ago, Marxist ideology was pushed as the accepted version of history.
[00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:52.508]  It was sort of a revisionist history, but with a communist bias.
[00:54:52.688 --> 00:54:56.950]  And then they tell you communism's dead as the system of big government spreads worldwide.
[00:54:57.231 --> 00:55:00.192]  It's just the control of the communist system is by private banks.
[00:55:00.928 --> 00:55:09.454]  Yeah, and I mean, you were talking about the firework ban earlier, which is again, sort of a communist sort of law, you know, big government.
[00:55:09.474 --> 00:55:11.596]  Because it might hurt somebody, we gotta ban it.
[00:55:11.696 --> 00:55:15.419]  Oh, we gotta have a satellite tracker box in your car if it saves one child.
[00:55:15.899 --> 00:55:22.624]  Yeah, and I mean, I was watching the news just before I came on today, and it showed a policeman with a hidden camera.
[00:55:23.334 --> 00:55:33.297]  And it showed a man smoking a cigarette and dropping the stub on the side of the street, and the policeman went up to him and said, that'll be a £50 fine, sir.
[00:55:33.917 --> 00:55:41.759]  So, again, these tiny laws that come in, again, condition us to accept the bigger laws that ban things like firearms.
[00:55:41.859 --> 00:55:45.980]  Exactly, and now in New York, they've been ordered to arrest people for any petty reason.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.461]  It's about squeezing and getting us all into the system.
[00:55:48.821 --> 00:55:49.541]  Anything else, Peter?
[00:55:50.576 --> 00:56:01.245]  Just out of Webster's Dictionary under Dialectic Materialism, a philosophy founded by Karl Marx which forms the basis of communist doctrine.
[00:56:02.246 --> 00:56:11.613]  It combines the materialistic idea of matter over mind with the Hegelian dialectic in which opposing forces are constantly being reunited at a higher level.
[00:56:11.633 --> 00:56:14.456]  I tell you what, stay there, Peter.
[00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:15.196]  I'm going to come back.
[00:56:15.236 --> 00:56:16.457]  I want you to focus on that more.
[00:56:16.477 --> 00:56:17.818]  I'm going to go to Dan and others.
[00:56:18.179 --> 00:56:19.259]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:56:19.279 --> 00:56:19.720]  Stay with us.
[00:56:21.084 --> 00:56:24.085]  When was the last- You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:56:24.406 --> 00:56:30.068]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:56:30.348 --> 00:56:38.672]  You haven't alkalized your body, and in fact- This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.957 --> 00:56:47.598]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.278 --> 00:56:49.299]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.141]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.801 --> 00:56:52.622]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.383 --> 00:56:54.283]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.303 --> 00:56:58.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.128 --> 00:57:03.251]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.854 --> 00:57:08.055]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.095 --> 00:57:09.797]  That's me, deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:57:10.518 --> 00:57:11.919]  Central Texas Command Center.
[00:57:12.961 --> 00:57:15.182]  We're going to take a lot of calls and cover a ton of news.
[00:57:15.343 --> 00:57:22.908]  Talk about 9-1-1, talk about the police state, talk about the missing weapons of mass destruction, the false left-right paradigm and paradigm management.
[00:57:23.388 --> 00:57:25.769]  Call the free number to join us on air in the second hour, 800-259-9231.
[00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.829]  800-259-9231.
[00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:27.571]  And I have the head of Caspian.
[00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:48.667]  Coming on in the next hour, they got into the big RFID consortium website with Walmart and the Department of Defense, using the, just trying random passcodes, like Authorize.
[00:57:49.068 --> 00:57:54.374]  They got into some internal areas, all legally and lawfully, this was off the main site, no hacking involved.
[00:57:55.186 --> 00:58:05.072]  And I found out where they've used words like how they want to manipulate, how they want to neutralize us, how they want to destroy opposition to the RFID trackerships.
[00:58:05.112 --> 00:58:05.933]  That's in the third hour.
[00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:13.357]  And I'll cover some of that with Paul Joseph Watson, author and webmaster and researcher and writer, who is joining us right now.
[00:58:14.118 --> 00:58:18.280]  And his first book, and it's longer than mine and more detailed.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.282]  My book's kind of like a coffee table book, 230 pages.
[00:58:21.722 --> 00:58:24.584]  Each page is concentrated information and facts.
[00:58:25.656 --> 00:58:27.076]  It's a great bathroom book, too.
[00:58:27.096 --> 00:58:29.537]  They said, you know, if somebody just wants to read a page or two at a time.
[00:58:30.037 --> 00:58:31.337]  Poor, you know, bedside book.
[00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:40.359]  His book's almost... it's coming out at about 340 pages or so, and that's full of images and graphics.
[00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:43.819]  I'm publishing it, and it'll be out in about three weeks.
[00:58:44.039 --> 00:58:47.440]  But he's joining us to talk about the New World Order, and I respect his analysis.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.521]  He's a webmaster for my website, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:51.681]  We also have InfoWars.com.
[00:58:53.602 --> 00:59:06.026]  Peter in Florida was bringing up the dialectic and dialectic materialism and how Karl Marx talked about taking so-called opposing forces and merging them over and over again, a system of psychological warfare.
[00:59:06.506 --> 00:59:09.747]  Go ahead and re-read that Webster's Dictionary definition, Peter.
[00:59:09.767 --> 00:59:17.329]  A philosophy founded by Karl Marx which forms the basis of communist doctrine.
[00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:27.676]  It combines the materialistic idea of matter over mind with the Hegelian dialect in which opposing forces are constantly being reunited at a higher level.
[00:59:27.696 --> 00:59:29.917]  That's dialectic materialism.
[00:59:29.937 --> 00:59:31.958]  That's the dictionary.
[00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:36.001]  And what does that mean to you, or put it in a nutshell for somebody that's confused?
[00:59:37.162 --> 00:59:42.405]  You can't believe anything you hear, you just gotta know the difference between despotism and freedom.
[00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:43.441]  That's it.
[00:59:43.481 --> 00:59:50.027]  They confuse it between left and right, communism and capitalism, when really it's the same force of centralization.
[00:59:50.047 --> 00:59:51.227]  Paul Watson comments.
[00:59:52.528 --> 00:59:55.891]  Well, actually I was reading about this sort of topic earlier today.
[00:59:57.252 --> 01:00:07.360]  An Anthony Sutton excerpt from his Gull and Bones book, which I'll be posting on prisonplanet.com tomorrow, he talks about Marxism and Hegelianism.
[01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:13.612]  And he states that the answer to this seeming political puzzle lies in the Hegelian logic.
[01:00:14.252 --> 01:00:23.400]  Remember that both Marx and Hitler, the extremes of left and right, presented as textbook enemies, evolved out of the same philosophical system, Hegelianism.
[01:00:24.022 --> 01:00:31.823]  That brings screams of intellectual anguish from Marxists and Nazis, but is well known to any student of political systems.
[01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:40.565]  Well, Hitler socialized things, a big welfare system, he called himself a National Socialist, but they call it fascism when Hitler and Stalin were buddies.
[01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:50.247]  Again, the globalists try to give you two false choices, a left-wing UN, a right-wing UN, what type of world government, bypassing any discussion of, hey, we don't want a world government.
[01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:52.747]  Do you agree with that, Peter?
[01:00:53.695 --> 01:00:56.717]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:00:58.098 --> 01:01:03.321]  Well, if we don't telegraph that bedrock message of real paradigm to people, it's over.
[01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:08.464]  If we can't get that across, people will continue to be confused by the false paradigm.
[01:01:08.584 --> 01:01:09.324]  Go ahead.
[01:01:10.325 --> 01:01:15.708]  Yeah, you can find more about this on newswithviews.com.
[01:01:16.949 --> 01:01:23.273]  It's an article done by Detective Phil Wart called Community Oriented Policing.
[01:01:24.603 --> 01:01:26.885]  And Bush said that he was a communitarian.
[01:01:27.246 --> 01:01:32.671]  The dictionary until about 20 years ago said a communitarian is one who promotes communist systems.
[01:01:33.192 --> 01:01:39.197]  And in the official platform of Bush Cheney 2000, they say we are first and foremost communitarians.
[01:01:39.618 --> 01:01:40.559]  Hidden in plain view.
[01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:41.299]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:42.721]  Alex Jones.
[01:01:42.761 --> 01:01:46.024]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[01:01:46.264 --> 01:01:48.887]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:55.429]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:01:55.749 --> 01:01:57.111]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:01:57.331 --> 01:02:04.599]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:09.064]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:02:09.264 --> 01:02:11.626]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:02:11.807 --> 01:02:16.511]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[01:02:16.711 --> 01:02:23.638]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[01:02:23.838 --> 01:02:27.101]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[01:02:27.362 --> 01:02:30.785]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:02:33.027 --> 01:02:36.070]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.231]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:41.514]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:46.378]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:50.981]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:55.505]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:55.545 --> 01:02:56.886]  The New World Order.
[01:02:58.667 --> 01:03:02.872]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:02.952 --> 01:03:09.880]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.023]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.403 --> 01:03:22.831]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:28.375]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:03:28.895 --> 01:03:32.097]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:32.137 --> 01:03:32.658]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:32.678 --> 01:03:33.939]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:03:41.324 --> 01:03:44.067]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[01:03:44.307 --> 01:03:50.632]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[01:03:50.932 --> 01:03:56.817]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[01:03:57.278 --> 01:04:01.001]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax exempt?
[01:04:01.716 --> 01:04:03.277]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[01:04:03.538 --> 01:04:04.378]  Well, there is a way.
[01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:10.744]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:21.392]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[01:04:21.452 --> 01:04:22.253]  Constitution.
[01:04:22.533 --> 01:04:24.155]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[01:04:24.435 --> 01:04:26.737]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[01:04:27.177 --> 01:04:34.899]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:04:35.159 --> 01:04:39.940]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:49.422]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:54.344 --> 01:05:04.711]  To boil this down simply and succinctly, we talk about how the rhetoric of the Republicans and the Democrats is different.
[01:05:05.672 --> 01:05:08.974]  But the actions are carbon poppies.
[01:05:10.276 --> 01:05:14.520]  We're talking to Paul Joseph Watson, the webmaster for my website, presentplanet.com.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:21.345]  He's also an author, written a lot of great articles and a lot of great analysis, and I'm publishing his first book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.047]  Man, what a great title, but it's a great book.
[01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.329]  And no, it's not out yet, and no, you can't order it.
[01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.470]  And yes, it is a tour de force.
[01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.953]  Let's go back to the calls, Paul.
[01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:33.135]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Illinois.
[01:05:34.276 --> 01:05:35.117]  Dan, you're on the air.
[01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:35.717]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:05:35.737 --> 01:05:36.878]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:37.479]  Pretty good.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:44.384]  I'd also think that the way this is done, in fact, is the constant redefinition of meanings.
[01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:51.129]  It gives an example, in other words, good people do evil things, and evil people do good things.
[01:05:51.149 --> 01:06:00.756]  In other words, that premise... And now the good guys on all the sitcoms and dramas, they have to torture, but torture's now a good thing, and... Exactly.
[01:06:00.996 --> 01:06:05.199]  Right, the constant redefining of... and I'm just giving examples because it's more subtle than that.
[01:06:06.227 --> 01:06:15.315]  And the other thing... That's what Orwell talked about in the 11th edition of Ingsoc, where they're getting rid of whole words, where you can't use words.
[01:06:15.755 --> 01:06:17.217]  That's everything that's happening today.
[01:06:17.257 --> 01:06:19.799]  People think, oh Orwell, this guy was a psychic.
[01:06:19.879 --> 01:06:22.962]  No, he worked for the Imperial Police, secret police in India.
[01:06:23.202 --> 01:06:26.865]  He worked for the Communist later and found out both sides were controlled.
[01:06:26.925 --> 01:06:32.069]  Let's get a comment from Watson about Mr. Blair, a pen name George Orwell.
[01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.590]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.023]  Well, obviously you mentioned Ingsoc.
[01:06:37.485 --> 01:06:46.737]  Something related to that came out just yesterday with the British ID card that's being introduced by stealth, even though 80% or more of the British people oppose it.
[01:06:47.638 --> 01:06:49.621]  This idea of gaining liberty.
[01:06:50.387 --> 01:06:52.028]  Meanwhile, losing liberty.
[01:06:52.368 --> 01:06:53.929]  Now, you posted that on Prison Planet.
[01:06:53.989 --> 01:06:59.672]  He actually, Blair actually said, and his minister said, oh, you gain liberty, freedom plus.
[01:07:00.252 --> 01:07:07.876]  Yeah, and the exact quote was, we are strengthened in our liberty if our identity is protected from theft.
[01:07:08.277 --> 01:07:13.079]  When their system of identification number has caused identity theft and they admit it.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.762]  Create the crisis, offer the solution, get you deeper into the pit.
[01:07:17.842 --> 01:07:18.102]  Dan?
[01:07:19.082 --> 01:07:20.482]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:07:20.843 --> 01:07:23.884]  And what I was going to say, you were talking about Unitarian before.
[01:07:24.364 --> 01:07:29.645]  The Unitarian is the most, it's not Muslim that's dangerous, the Unitarian is the most dangerous force out there.
[01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:39.028]  Well, Communitarian, and then they have their churches in our communities that are the Communitarian or Unitarian, and I've been to Unitarian churches before to see what they're doing.
[01:07:39.068 --> 01:07:40.869]  I mean, it's openly a Communist meeting.
[01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.929]  Well, it's scrambled eggs.
[01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:45.150]  Each person has the truth within himself.
[01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:48.091]  So that means each person can make his own definition, and it's okay.
[01:07:48.692 --> 01:07:50.433]  That's what the most dangerous thing out there.
[01:07:50.513 --> 01:07:53.996]  But it's like a big change agent, though, because they all get led in a certain direction.
[01:07:54.476 --> 01:07:57.238]  Well, because it's like not standing on the ground.
[01:07:57.358 --> 01:07:59.880]  Once you're up in the air, you can get blown around with anything.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:03.983]  Well, that's what O'Brien says to Winston in the Ministry of Love when they're torturing him.
[01:08:04.463 --> 01:08:09.887]  He says, you know, Winston says, well, you're not really holding up three fingers, but you say you want four or two or one.
[01:08:09.907 --> 01:08:10.348]  He goes, hey,
[01:08:10.908 --> 01:08:18.211]  We want you to where you see all fingers at all times and have no real thoughts, to where I could be a soap bubble floating up off the ground.
[01:08:18.371 --> 01:08:18.952]  Scramble eggs!
[01:08:20.672 --> 01:08:25.274]  I hope we're not getting too esoteric here, getting off into too much psychology.
[01:08:25.414 --> 01:08:38.460]  But the other thing I wanted to mention was that, under the disguise, we're very aware that the rights are being given up, but the communist influence of what's really going on is the responsibility is being handed over.
[01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:39.981]  That's communism.
[01:08:40.001 --> 01:08:41.542]  You give all your responsibility to the state.
[01:08:41.562 --> 01:08:43.663]  And then no one points out that we have a war on terror.
[01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:44.824]  The terror attacks get bigger.
[01:08:44.844 --> 01:08:45.824]  We have a war on drugs.
[01:08:45.844 --> 01:08:47.505]  There's triple the heroin, double the cocaine.
[01:08:47.785 --> 01:08:48.686]  And more people in prison.
[01:08:48.926 --> 01:08:50.046]  We have a war on illiteracy.
[01:08:50.066 --> 01:08:51.047]  There's more illiteracy.
[01:08:51.367 --> 01:08:52.047]  A war on crime.
[01:08:52.067 --> 01:08:52.748]  There's more crime.
[01:08:52.808 --> 01:08:53.748]  Paul, comments to this?
[01:08:55.049 --> 01:08:57.810]  Well yeah, we talked about communism and rights being given up.
[01:08:58.351 --> 01:09:02.493]  Obviously we know that communism was controlled anyway, but the fact is they are following the
[01:09:04.033 --> 01:09:10.876]  The so-called cream of communist and Nazi ideals merge together because left and right are the same system at the top.
[01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:15.939]  One of the major planks of this is the moral decline of society.
[01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:23.142]  You can go to the 45 goals of communism and find, and this has entered into the congressional record,
[01:09:23.946 --> 01:09:34.335]  And, um, number 25 actually states that present homosexuality, degeneracy, and promiscuity as normal, natural, and healthy.
[01:09:34.455 --> 01:09:45.984]  Well that goes back to UNESCO saying the family's a disease, terminate it, but it's okay to say heterosexuals are a disease and should be terminated and call us breeders, but then it's okay for this group.
[01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:51.929]  See how, also, in their whole hate crimes lexicon, they get to be hateful but we can't counter that.
[01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:53.190]  That's all the redefinitions.
[01:09:54.369 --> 01:09:56.051]  There's all your redefinitions right there.
[01:09:57.893 --> 01:10:00.475]  Up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black.
[01:10:00.675 --> 01:10:04.739]  The family is the disease rather than the heart of any situation.
[01:10:04.799 --> 01:10:12.347]  Well the historical and basic common sense facts show that you're four to five times more likely in a single parent home to end up on drugs or in crime.
[01:10:12.567 --> 01:10:13.268]  But they don't care.
[01:10:13.308 --> 01:10:15.010]  They do everything they can to break up the family.
[01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:18.213]  And then have programs to quote strengthen it but actually destroy it more.
[01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:20.380]  Absolutely.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.811]  And they know if you're degenerate, or you're on drugs, you're doing whatever, you're not going to care about your neighbor or corrupt government.
[01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:27.473]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:28.294 --> 01:10:29.957]  And that plays into the materialism.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.661]  You know, in the socialist system, materialism becomes more and more important.
[01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:45.826]  Not that material stuff is bad, but that when it's your God, and that comes first, past your family, and when you're so materialistic, you'll sell out Jesus Christ himself for twenty pieces of silver.
[01:10:46.186 --> 01:10:49.727]  That's materialism when you become Judas Iscariot.
[01:10:51.428 --> 01:10:59.731]  That's quite, and talking about degeneracy, I mean, the whole emphasis in the culture and on MTV is that they
[01:11:00.655 --> 01:11:06.420]  Put out that it's cool to be part of some kind of fad, whether that be fashion, music, whatever.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:15.567]  And that masquerades itself as culture and free expression and freedom itself, when in actual fact it divides the population into different slave camps.
[01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:24.755]  I mean, we saw the analogy in the Pinocchio movie where some of them got decadent and ended up getting shipped off to slave camps.
[01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:36.189]  So it's important to rediscover what's really important morally to tackle the New World Order because that is a major attack on the degeneracy of culture and society.
[01:11:36.249 --> 01:11:36.970]  It's deliberate.
[01:11:38.354 --> 01:11:40.397]  Well, I've used that example many times.
[01:11:40.457 --> 01:11:45.604]  They get the kids, they get them to engage in behaving as thugs.
[01:11:45.644 --> 01:11:56.498]  The establishment takes them out to this wonderland, gets them to party and steal and do all this and then that transforms them into beasts, mindless beasts that are then slaves of the system.
[01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:05.973]  And then you look into who's pushing all this, who was the financial backer behind feminism, and the same names crop up again and again.
[01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:13.935]  Gloria Steinem, in one of her own books, admits that this magazine was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency, and she was an active officer.
[01:12:14.116 --> 01:12:15.156]  This is mainstream, folks.
[01:12:15.196 --> 01:12:16.436]  In one of her own books, she admits it.
[01:12:16.776 --> 01:12:18.497]  Central Intelligence Agency officer.
[01:12:20.538 --> 01:12:27.602]  And that's the main point to emphasize, that the New World Order itself is not only a political movement, it's a cultural movement.
[01:12:28.203 --> 01:12:32.105]  And at the lower levels, it's a societal brainwashing method.
[01:12:32.485 --> 01:12:37.708]  Well, yeah, I mean, if a woman wants to be a brain surgeon or a rocket scientist, I'm sure she can do a great job as good or better than a man.
[01:12:37.768 --> 01:12:38.489]  The point is...
[01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:47.474]  And they tried to brainwash women to do this, but their instincts, what their desire is switched back against them so the government's panicking.
[01:12:47.874 --> 01:12:54.759]  All these professional women now want to make money early so they can go be mommies at home and enjoy that incredible thing that God's created.
[01:12:55.339 --> 01:13:01.003]  But the CIA came in, it's admitted, broke up the family so they'd have women working in factories
[01:13:01.663 --> 01:13:11.893]  So they could have a higher tax bracket, the taxes at higher levels, so the kids would be in the daycare centers and the head start getting their vaccines, learning how to turn mommy and daddy in for owning a gun.
[01:13:13.134 --> 01:13:17.919]  And it came out that the whole 60s movement was part of that same agenda with the LSD.
[01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:20.001]  Yeah, the CIA released the patent on it.
[01:13:20.061 --> 01:13:21.902]  Leary was their agent the entire time.
[01:13:24.071 --> 01:13:32.637]  Again, conservatives would have been against the Vietnam War, but they would hire beatniks, and many of them known government agencies and now public folks.
[01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:43.025]  They would come into a town, spit on people, break windows, act like horrible beasts, and then the conservatives would go, well, this war must be good if these guys are out here doing this.
[01:13:44.332 --> 01:13:51.217]  And those beatniks later became conservative talk show hosts like Michael Savage.
[01:13:51.297 --> 01:14:00.503]  And you notice then in the redefinition he gets fired off MSNBC for saying something about a group and engaging in the First Amendment.
[01:14:01.255 --> 01:14:09.457]  But it's bad to talk about the homosexuals, but not bad to say put anyone in a forced labor camp that disagrees with the government.
[01:14:09.697 --> 01:14:10.498]  That's okay.
[01:14:10.538 --> 01:14:12.938]  Put people in concentration camps.
[01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:13.718]  He said that.
[01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:17.860]  That's okay on MSNBC, but don't say anything about this protected group.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:18.720]  See the new values?
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:24.922]  And he engaged in inciting violence by saying attack peace protesters.
[01:14:24.942 --> 01:14:27.602]  Now it doesn't matter if these protesters are left-wing.
[01:14:27.682 --> 01:14:29.743]  I mean, advocating attacking them is
[01:14:30.513 --> 01:14:31.594]  Not really acceptable.
[01:14:31.614 --> 01:14:38.762]  I mean, the comment that he made that he got sacked for is a complete distraction from what he said before, which is now being pushed under the rug.
[01:14:39.528 --> 01:14:55.699]  Yeah, it's saying put everybody in a camp, or slaver camp, take their assets, if they disagree with the government, and then now we see the Deputy Attorney General of California, Mike Van Winkle, agreeing, he's a liberal, saying protests may not be allowed because protesting a war aids the terrorist.
[01:14:55.999 --> 01:14:57.661]  Now the Republicans are with Gray Davis.
[01:14:57.901 --> 01:14:59.202]  Take the recall campaign.
[01:14:59.482 --> 01:15:01.403]  Let's say Arnold Schwarzenegger runs and wins.
[01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:08.068]  He's for gun control, he's for abortion, his father was a top Gestapo captain who arrested people,
[01:15:09.483 --> 01:15:11.684]  Later became the police chief of a major city?
[01:15:13.405 --> 01:15:18.647]  And by the way, Schwarzenegger in a Rolling Stone interview about eight years ago said he'd like to be the head of a federal police force.
[01:15:18.927 --> 01:15:19.827]  Doesn't that sound nice?
[01:15:21.088 --> 01:15:38.355]  Yeah, and then you get... I mean, obviously Schwarzenegger's been in these films like The Running Man, where he was a so-called freedom fighter, so brainwashed conservatives think that he's actually standing up for freedom and morality when he's the archetypal neocon, pro-abortion, pro-police state.
[01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:42.797]  And then it doesn't matter if you've got Davis or him, same deal.
[01:15:42.818 --> 01:15:46.940]  We'll come back and take some calls for the folks holding in Texas and other states.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:55.545]  Poll free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.

[01:16:05.591 --> 01:16:06.772]  I can't wait to have you up.
[01:16:07.112 --> 01:16:09.594]  I want to have you up once a week when your book comes out.
[01:16:09.674 --> 01:16:09.954]  I want to
[01:16:10.592 --> 01:16:12.832]  Dissect a chapter each week of your book.
[01:16:12.872 --> 01:16:13.913]  It's an amazing book.
[01:16:14.013 --> 01:16:16.273]  I mean, only person other than you to read it.
[01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.734]  It's now being printed, and no, we're not offering it yet.
[01:16:20.214 --> 01:16:24.195]  Order out of chaos, but I look forward to having you on the show on a routine basis.
[01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:25.575]  Stay with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:16:25.595 --> 01:16:28.236]  We're going to come back, go to more calls, and get into more news.
[01:16:29.636 --> 01:16:30.816]  Breaking the paradigm.
[01:16:31.536 --> 01:16:34.917]  Deprogramming you by showing you the reality for yourself.
[01:16:36.514 --> 01:16:37.196]  It's your choice.
[01:16:37.216 --> 01:16:39.101]  The red pill or the blue pill, folks.
[01:16:39.401 --> 01:16:40.725]  We can't make that decision for you.

[01:18:42.265 --> 01:18:46.167]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:46.387 --> 01:18:58.674]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:18:59.094 --> 01:18:59.495]  The U.S.
[01:18:59.555 --> 01:19:05.118]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:05.538 --> 01:19:07.739]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.661]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:10.701 --> 01:19:13.543]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:13.664 --> 01:19:19.668]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:20.109 --> 01:19:23.452]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:20:44.453 --> 01:20:49.596]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:50.276 --> 01:20:52.617]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:01.302]  Alright, Paul Watson, my friend, my compadre over at ChristmasPlanet.com.
[01:21:01.322 --> 01:21:02.303]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:21:02.763 --> 01:21:03.663]  Meg in Texas.
[01:21:04.644 --> 01:21:05.584]  Meg, you're on the air.
[01:21:05.664 --> 01:21:06.005]  Welcome.
[01:21:06.425 --> 01:21:08.146]  Yeah, hi Alex and Paul.
[01:21:08.446 --> 01:21:09.947]  Kudos to both you guys.
[01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:15.703]  I really appreciate your work and how well cited and documented it is.
[01:21:17.384 --> 01:21:28.676]  On your latest film, which is real good by the way, one of the most poignant parts of it was, I guess it was on 6th Street, being a Texas girl.
[01:21:28.696 --> 01:21:30.218]  It looked familiar.
[01:21:31.373 --> 01:21:33.554]  The uniformed police officers.
[01:21:33.594 --> 01:21:37.415]  Yeah, the guys in the ski masks refusing, covering their badges up with tape.
[01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:39.256]  Yeah, Paul, you would have appreciated it.
[01:21:39.296 --> 01:21:41.857]  They could have been in front of Buckingham Palace.
[01:21:41.877 --> 01:21:44.657]  Yeah, they wouldn't say anything back.
[01:21:45.258 --> 01:21:58.822]  Yeah, what can we do as citizens to, as a cause, to stop that kind of action and cause them to wear identification?
[01:21:59.562 --> 01:22:07.805]  Well, we went to the City Council and pointed out, Mike Hanson dug out the actual law, that if they're not an undercover work, they were violating state law.
[01:22:08.986 --> 01:22:11.787]  And if they do it willingly... That's a pretty public place there on 6th Street.
[01:22:11.907 --> 01:22:14.168]  If they do it multiple times willingly, it becomes a felony.
[01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:16.109]  It's a misdemeanor if they do it unwittingly.
[01:22:16.529 --> 01:22:16.749]  Really?
[01:22:16.769 --> 01:22:18.049]  Or without malice of forethought.
[01:22:18.089 --> 01:22:19.270]  So we pointed that out.
[01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:20.650]  They claim they're going to stop it.
[01:22:20.991 --> 01:22:23.832]  And the last time they were out, badges were visible.
[01:22:24.152 --> 01:22:25.192]  No black ski masks.
[01:22:25.212 --> 01:22:28.274]  They were wearing the federally issued Darth Vader outfits.
[01:22:28.354 --> 01:22:29.194]  Paul, any comments?
[01:22:30.775 --> 01:22:36.119]  Well, I remember having two pictures on my website and this was about two years ago now.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:42.005]  Yeah, well you're used to that over there somewhat with the monarch.
[01:22:43.406 --> 01:22:49.352]  I don't guess it's quite as innocuous as all that now there.
[01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:58.750]  Yeah, we have the same police state system, but we don't have them dressed up in riot gear and black ski masks.
[01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:04.493]  Yeah, anyway, but two years ago I posted on my website two different pictures.
[01:23:04.633 --> 01:23:10.297]  One was the Waffen SS Nazi Brigade and one was L.A.
[01:23:10.357 --> 01:23:13.498]  Cops, pictured in 2001 with all the riot gear on.
[01:23:13.779 --> 01:23:16.000]  And the two pictures were exactly the same.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:17.161]  Oh my goodness.
[01:23:17.401 --> 01:23:18.241]  It's pretty scary.
[01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:21.083]  Yeah, they're just starting to look alike all over.
[01:23:21.835 --> 01:23:24.097]  It's all, you know, perception.
[01:23:24.657 --> 01:23:24.998]  Yeah.
[01:23:25.798 --> 01:23:40.570]  Oh, Alex, a friend of yours and I were talking about owls the other day, and, you know, the Bohemian Grove thing with the owl statue and all that, and I had never heard the term molex.
[01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:49.777]  So I happen to have a metaphysical Bible dictionary from the Unity Church, and it's kind of interesting
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:55.243]  Molek is Hebrew for King, Ruler, Counselor, or Judge.
[01:23:55.983 --> 01:24:05.749]  But the metaphysical description of it is the ruling of public opinion and of the mind of the flesh in one's consciousness.
[01:24:06.489 --> 01:24:18.216]  Children being sacrificed in the fire to this God signifies one's mentally burning and destroying of new ideas by letting fear of or deep regard for
[01:24:18.755 --> 01:24:22.019]  What other persons may think, i.e., public opinion.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.843]  And that's what they did in the ceremonial cremation of care.
[01:24:24.863 --> 01:24:27.066]  They bring the bound effigy of a child.
[01:24:27.106 --> 01:24:28.287]  They tell you it's an effigy.
[01:24:28.768 --> 01:24:31.671]  They bring it up there, it screams, it begs, they burn it before mold.
[01:24:31.752 --> 01:24:33.093]  Oh, it sounded real, too.
[01:24:33.153 --> 01:24:35.196]  I watched that Bohemian Grove film.
[01:24:35.436 --> 01:24:36.197]  Well, thank you.
[01:24:38.119 --> 01:24:40.021]  Uh, Moloch was a bull or an owl.
[01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:46.965]  Most of those Babylonian slash Canaanite gods had double or triple or quadruple or in some cases ten different faces.
[01:24:47.385 --> 01:24:53.549]  But the owl, the bull, and they would bring the children before it and Leviticus says that it's the most evil demon you can worship.
[01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:58.232]  If a country's leaders worship that god, that the country will be cursed to evil.
[01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.394]  I mean, the Bible actually says this.
[01:25:01.535 --> 01:25:24.988]  Well, Alex, I've just, um, and anyone can do this, it's on the internet right now, I've just typed in Molek to dictionary.com and the very first definition is, quote, in the Bible, the God of the Canaanites and Phoenicians to whom children were sacrificed, and that's dictionary.com, the biggest referral site on the internet, so anyone can see that right now.
[01:25:25.228 --> 01:25:27.850]  Right, and I'll save it on, alright.
[01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:30.708]  I had it marked as the Ammonites, yes.
[01:25:32.029 --> 01:25:36.712]  Faulty thinking was one of the main things I remember in that definition.
[01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:46.498]  But, moreover, it goes on... They conduct a ritual to mesmerize us and enslave us and to have no conscience while they're doing it.
[01:25:46.799 --> 01:25:47.739]  They say this.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.061]  This is what George Bush attends.
[01:25:50.421 --> 01:25:56.985]  Along with public opinion, or swaying public opinion, with the prejudices, customs, and desires
[01:25:57.478 --> 01:25:57.799]  Thank you.
[01:26:10.072 --> 01:26:10.513]  Wow.
[01:26:10.913 --> 01:26:12.515]  And that's from where?
[01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:18.620]  This is from the Metaphysical Bible Dictionary put out by the Unity Church.
[01:26:18.701 --> 01:26:20.883]  I'm not sure about the date of publication.
[01:26:21.003 --> 01:26:24.246]  That's bizarre, but that is accurate to what I saw at Bohemian Grove.
[01:26:24.666 --> 01:26:25.627]  Thank you for the call, Meg.
[01:26:25.888 --> 01:26:26.728]  Paul Watson, stay there.
[01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.411]  We'll come back and talk to Mike, Randy, Wyatt, Alan, and others.
[01:26:29.911 --> 01:26:31.753]  And you have to start launching into some more of the news.
[01:26:31.893 --> 01:26:32.334]  Stay with us.
[01:26:33.636 --> 01:26:36.657]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.538 --> 01:26:40.359]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.502]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:53.063]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:26:53.243 --> 01:26:54.484]  The Aeronizer.
[01:26:54.664 --> 01:26:59.886]  8448 to learn more, or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[01:27:00.186 --> 01:27:02.587]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[01:27:16.435 --> 01:27:20.539]  All right, folks.
[01:27:20.659 --> 01:27:23.242]  It's Tuesday, the 8th of July, 2003.
[01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:27.426]  I'm about to go to your calls and into more of this news.
[01:27:27.466 --> 01:27:34.333]  Before I go any further, I do want to encourage the listeners to visit Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to go to the
[01:27:35.302 --> 01:27:52.214]  Secure online shopping cart, and to order my documentary films, to make copies of them for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes, to air them on AXS TV, to get them out to talk show hosts and opinion makers and preachers, public officials and authorities in your area now, because a lot of them are good old boys and are corrupt.
[01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:55.977]  But they have no idea what they're part of, the bigger system they're part of.
[01:27:56.017 --> 01:27:58.759]  They need to see the crimes of the globalists.
[01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:06.462]  The globalists own and run the dominant media and spin this system, but if we put their crimes end-to-end, they would circle the planet hundreds of times.
[01:28:07.342 --> 01:28:08.703]  We need to get the word out.
[01:28:09.423 --> 01:28:12.083]  And 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, frankly, is my best film.
[01:28:12.203 --> 01:28:16.224]  It's two hours and 24 minutes long on VHS.
[01:28:16.444 --> 01:28:20.905]  It's 170 minutes long on DVD, the only film I offer on DVD.
[01:28:21.925 --> 01:28:27.186]  And it covers the history of the government carrying out terror attacks worldwide, different governments doing it, admissions of it.
[01:28:28.442 --> 01:28:29.162]  Official U.S.
[01:28:29.202 --> 01:28:42.727]  government plans to carry out terror attacks like Operation Northwoods, what really happened in Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center, the second World Trade Center attacks on 9-1-1, where the globalists are going in the future, the police state, Homeland Security, the Patriot Act.
[01:28:43.387 --> 01:28:45.188]  It's in.
[01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:46.468]  9-1-1, the road to tyranny.
[01:28:46.708 --> 01:28:49.209]  Part two of that expands with Masters of Terror.
[01:28:49.249 --> 01:28:52.370]  It's a little over two hours long and is excellent as well.
[01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:53.931]  It's mainly just on 9-1-1, though.
[01:28:56.101 --> 01:28:57.382]  And really details that.
[01:28:58.142 --> 01:29:05.426]  We have Police State 3 Total Enslavement that gets into dozens of other examples of government-sponsored terror we don't cover in the other two films.
[01:29:06.847 --> 01:29:11.509]  And then it gets more into Homeland Security, Total Information Awareness Network, Patriot Act 2.
[01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:14.891]  It gets into government-run white slavery rings.
[01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:17.092]  It gets into government drug dealing.
[01:29:18.333 --> 01:29:19.774]  It just covers so much, folks.
[01:29:19.814 --> 01:29:20.934]  It's my longest film.
[01:29:20.994 --> 01:29:23.696]  It's two hours and forty minutes long, okay?
[01:29:25.575 --> 01:29:27.297]  Frankly, it's 2 hours and 41 minutes.
[01:29:27.557 --> 01:29:28.958]  I finally really timed it out.
[01:29:29.118 --> 01:29:31.861]  You need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:29:31.881 --> 01:29:33.422]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[01:29:33.442 --> 01:29:35.764]  Your purchase supports this broadcast and what we're doing.
[01:29:36.525 --> 01:29:39.408]  They're $20 if you order 3 or more of any of the 9 films.
[01:29:39.828 --> 01:29:43.051]  So go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:29:43.869 --> 01:29:45.551]  A call toll free to order at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:45.992]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:29:46.012 --> 01:29:46.552]  One more time, folks.
[01:29:46.632 --> 01:29:47.113]  Make the call.
[01:29:47.133 --> 01:29:48.534]  Get the films.
[01:29:48.554 --> 01:29:52.799]  Get powerful tools to wake people up in your area and support the broadcast.
[01:30:03.371 --> 01:30:10.413]  1-888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, right here in Austin, Texas, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:30:25.666 --> 01:30:28.787]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:30:28.807 --> 01:30:30.127]  So take action and get the films.
[01:30:30.207 --> 01:30:32.188]  And get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:30:32.208 --> 01:30:33.568]  The anniversary of that's coming up.
[01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:40.310]  What, next Thursday or Friday they're going to have their 129th ritual.
[01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:49.372]  And Helmut Schmidt, we have his own publication, his own book, Men and Powers, close up of the cover, close up to the page numbers and subsections.
[01:30:49.853 --> 01:30:51.033]  He was German Chancellor.
[01:30:51.573 --> 01:30:53.894]  He admits they have other Bohemian Groves in Europe.
[01:30:53.974 --> 01:30:54.954]  Oh, they go way back.
[01:30:55.802 --> 01:30:57.983]  That's where Skull and Bones goes back to, the Druids.
[01:30:58.583 --> 01:31:01.484]  And he says that he loves the Bohemian Grove in California.
[01:31:01.524 --> 01:31:03.765]  He loves the CFR and Trilateral Commission.
[01:31:04.145 --> 01:31:05.286]  How they all meet there.
[01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:10.107]  How the Bilderberg Group members meet at the Bohemian Grove to quote, have their Druid rituals.
[01:31:10.888 --> 01:31:14.149]  So that's about 45 seconds of the two hour film.
[01:31:14.549 --> 01:31:15.669]  To give you an idea of what's in it.
[01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:17.590]  Just all documented.
[01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:19.091]  Then we have video of the ritual itself.
[01:31:19.751 --> 01:31:22.172]  Paul, you want to comment on Skull and Bones and the occult?
[01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:26.392]  Being behind this, whether people want to admit it or not, then we'll take some calls.
[01:31:28.113 --> 01:31:48.827]  Well yeah, just a side note, the popularity of your videos, which you were just mentioning, are proven by the fact that the bandwidth for PrisonPlanet.com is something ridiculous like 129%, simply because most of your videos are actually posted online in the video section, which again is another, you know, point.
[01:31:48.847 --> 01:31:51.249]  Describe how many gigs the Prison Planet's using.
[01:31:53.590 --> 01:32:08.460]  Well, obviously, Dwayne Cootes has got some systems that can handle massive surges of bandwidth, but InfoWars.com, now it probably gets double the amount of hits that PrisonPlanet.com gets, obviously, because it's been around longer.
[01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:15.786]  But InfoWars.com is on about 11% of the maximum, because they've got these massive systems that can handle it.
[01:32:16.246 --> 01:32:17.427]  But PrisonPlanet.com
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.901]  I'm having to pay for that.
[01:32:19.961 --> 01:32:21.681]  That's why I wish people would support us.
[01:32:37.228 --> 01:32:44.951]  Well, and other folks have posted my videos, and I link to them when they do it if they want to handle it, but they always take them down after a while when a million people come through.
[01:32:45.511 --> 01:33:04.538]  Literally, we put up a clip of payoffs at the Texas Capitol a couple years ago that I caught on tape, and it got linked on the NRA's website, and gun owners, and Eaton Bear Arms, and like a million people watched it, a million hits of it, and it was like $1,000 a day or something.
[01:33:04.578 --> 01:33:05.799]  I had to take it down, folks.
[01:33:07.545 --> 01:33:11.467]  It's just, we do all, you know, we could have our own TV networks and we have the bandwidth.
[01:33:12.108 --> 01:33:14.009]  That's the problem with internet taxation.
[01:33:14.029 --> 01:33:15.669]  That's why they want to begin the taxation.
[01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.410]  That'll break the back of everybody.
[01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:19.311]  You won't even be able to hear audio streams anymore.
[01:33:19.932 --> 01:33:21.172]  Which, of course, we don't pay for.
[01:33:21.452 --> 01:33:22.733]  That's the affiliate that does that.
[01:33:22.753 --> 01:33:24.234]  It's just amazing.
[01:33:25.629 --> 01:33:26.629]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:38.234]  In your research of Bohemian Grove or Skull and Bones, you just mentioned the AP article from the 50s you found that you'll be posting tomorrow, Associated Press, where you have the communist leaders going to the Grove in the 50s.
[01:33:38.454 --> 01:33:40.755]  Yeah, that's correct.
[01:33:40.835 --> 01:33:43.055]  I mean, anyone can see this.
[01:33:43.115 --> 01:33:47.357]  Obviously, you have to pay for the access to dig back in the archives 50 years.
[01:33:48.143 --> 01:33:53.864]  But it's associated to a press article out of the Wisconsin Daily Journal, July 6, 59.
[01:33:53.964 --> 01:34:00.086]  So obviously it's around this time period, back when Bohemian Grove were actually meeting in 59.
[01:34:01.686 --> 01:34:10.848]  And it says, quote, the Soviet Union's first deputy premier today winds up a stay in California during which he was wined and dined by capitalists.
[01:34:12.849 --> 01:34:17.710]  And it goes on to describe how the rest of the political spectrum were very opposed to his
[01:34:18.735 --> 01:34:21.296]  Just his visit, and this was covered in other newspapers.
[01:34:21.316 --> 01:34:28.098]  Well, who was one of the top folks at the Grove in 59 but Prescott Bush, grandfather of the Fool's Society president we have now?
[01:34:28.118 --> 01:34:37.341]  What do you think about that Brotherhood group that just came out with Ashcroft and others and congressmen living in buildings together and saying Hitler was good?
[01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:39.441]  Did you see all that came out in the Harpers?
[01:34:40.862 --> 01:34:45.243]  Yeah, and these are the sort of groups that are even above groups like Skull and Bones.
[01:34:46.268 --> 01:34:49.470]  The ones that, you know, haven't come out in published newspapers.
[01:34:49.990 --> 01:35:04.998]  You know, it's funny, that just came out about the Brotherhood, and when I was having to make arguments with, you know, just about their power, we already knew about them, a few months ago in Kansas City, with the guy that wrote The Unseen Hand, Ralph Epperson, was saying, no, the top group's the Brotherhood.
[01:35:05.258 --> 01:35:09.640]  They've got all these interlocking groups, as Tax Mars has documented, they're all members of the same groups.
[01:35:10.553 --> 01:35:33.945]  And people sometimes don't believe the sort of rituals and practices that go on at places like Bohemian Grove but I've got a Washington Post article here from June 1997 and it talks about how then Secretary of State George Shultz actually proposed to his wife at Bohemian Grove and it goes on to casually mention that
[01:35:35.558 --> 01:35:51.348]  Last month, Schultz gave her a ruby diamond and sapphire engagement ring that would be red, white and blue and popped the question at San Francisco's Bohemian Club in July, he'll repair for the club's rustic camp at the Bohemian Grove where men often romp naked.
[01:35:51.468 --> 01:35:55.571]  And that's an exact quote out of the Washington Post six years ago.
[01:35:56.371 --> 01:36:03.497]  Well, also, that would mean meeting at the clubhouse in downtown San Francisco in an ornately built building with gargoyles on it.
[01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:05.219]  That's where the women are allowed.
[01:36:05.239 --> 01:36:12.445]  They're not allowed at the camp itself, founded in 1873, but has had presidents going to it since 1900.
[01:36:13.266 --> 01:36:15.448]  So this is the type of stuff they're doing there.
[01:36:16.261 --> 01:36:21.723]  And it is... I mean, I've got a Washington Times article in the film about how they bust in the male prostitutes.
[01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:25.224]  And then I get an email, how dare you bash the gays?
[01:36:25.344 --> 01:36:26.105]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:36:26.565 --> 01:36:34.148]  These are the Christian conservatives busing in their $2,000 an hour male whores, and the liberals are defending them.
[01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:34.868]  Isn't that nice?
[01:36:36.228 --> 01:36:36.769]  Exactly.
[01:36:36.789 --> 01:36:42.351]  I mean, with that, obviously we're talking about people labeling as conspiracy theorists.
[01:36:42.431 --> 01:36:43.051]  We're talking about
[01:36:43.914 --> 01:36:47.317]  Well, a month ago, Rumsfeld accepted the Doolittle Award
[01:37:13.897 --> 01:37:19.882]  Uh, you know, after the famous guy who flew the B-243s or B-244s off the front aircraft carriers to bomb Tokyo.
[01:37:20.602 --> 01:37:23.785]  And he said, oh, I got a chance to meet dude a little at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:31.471]  Yeah, and I mean, you go to the newspaper archive website and just type in Bohemian Grove and you get like 300 articles spanning
[01:37:33.391 --> 01:37:46.639]  Right back to, I mean, if you type in Illuminati, you can get London Times articles from 1898 talking about German Illuminati and how it had infiltrated the Christian church in the Greek.
[01:37:46.799 --> 01:37:51.722]  John Quincy Adams had a band that said that a secret German society was taking over.
[01:37:51.742 --> 01:37:55.284]  The founding fathers that were Masons all quit.
[01:37:55.644 --> 01:37:56.725]  They almost took over.
[01:37:56.745 --> 01:37:58.486]  I mean, this is all admitted.
[01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:02.791]  The president wrote books and letters about it.
[01:38:02.831 --> 01:38:08.554]  It's not like it's a... Well, look, I get attacked by talk shows all the time.
[01:38:08.714 --> 01:38:10.555]  Alex Jones believes there's a new world order.
[01:38:10.855 --> 01:38:13.636]  We got all these presidents saying it on tape, Paul.
[01:38:14.437 --> 01:38:14.877]  Well, anyone...
[01:38:15.552 --> 01:38:18.854]  I mean, people ask me how I get the news articles for the website.
[01:38:18.874 --> 01:38:22.075]  They don't go to just other alternative media websites.
[01:38:22.095 --> 01:38:23.576]  They go directly to the source.
[01:38:24.016 --> 01:38:33.601]  Anyone can go to Google and type in New World Order and check that every day, and articles every single day pop up where people are talking about a New World Order.
[01:38:33.662 --> 01:38:37.263]  Sydney Morning Herald, Moscow Times, Associated Press, MSNBC,
[01:38:38.914 --> 01:38:42.735]  Yeah, whether that be in Russia, China, France, or in America.
[01:38:42.755 --> 01:38:48.977]  I mean, you get stories like, conservative push for a new world order, neo-conservative.
[01:38:49.497 --> 01:38:55.959]  And those sort of articles are on there every day, and yet, we're still conspiracy theorists to say that new world order exists.
[01:38:56.739 --> 01:38:57.379]  It's amazing.
[01:38:58.064 --> 01:39:09.655]  Talk about double-think, that's 1984, where they say one day you're at war with East Asia, and then the same newscast say we've never been at war with them, and then say we have been at war with them, and then if you say, hey, that's saying different things, you're crazy, they come arrest you.
[01:39:11.036 --> 01:39:17.102]  Yeah, and we get that sort of thing with the so-called nations that the neocons are planning to invade.
[01:39:17.262 --> 01:39:22.667]  One week they're our allies, and the next week they're our enemies, and Libya in particular.
[01:39:23.503 --> 01:39:34.612]  Well, they're giving North Korea nuclear reactors and weapons parts while saying they're going to nuke us, and it's just crazy.
[01:39:34.652 --> 01:39:35.593]  Let's take calls.
[01:39:35.653 --> 01:39:36.453]  Real quick, folks.
[01:39:36.573 --> 01:39:37.774]  Mike in Nevada, you're on the air.
[01:39:37.834 --> 01:39:38.495]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:40.997 --> 01:39:41.637]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:39:41.657 --> 01:39:42.938]  You're on the air worldwide, sir.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:44.960]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.342]  Yeah, actually, that's New Jersey.
[01:39:47.422 --> 01:39:48.263]  Okay, well, go ahead.
[01:39:49.474 --> 01:39:53.257]  Yes, I want to ask something of Paul about his website.
[01:39:53.537 --> 01:39:54.038]  I don't know.
[01:39:54.138 --> 01:39:56.820]  I'm not really familiar with you.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.361]  This is the first time I've heard of you.
[01:39:58.541 --> 01:40:00.163]  Well, President Plant, it's my website.
[01:40:00.203 --> 01:40:01.944]  He's the director of it and the webmaster.
[01:40:02.445 --> 01:40:05.067]  And so is Infowars.com and Infowars.net.
[01:40:05.527 --> 01:40:08.009]  Paul has Propagandamatrix.com.
[01:40:08.650 --> 01:40:10.891]  Okay, now I know who you are.
[01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:14.334]  Yeah, I have a question.
[01:40:14.494 --> 01:40:18.978]  Actually, not a question, but more or less like a statement about
[01:40:19.881 --> 01:40:21.462]  You know, the form of governments and everything.
[01:40:24.204 --> 01:40:33.451]  The political spectrum, as we've been believed and learned, is that we stay in the middle of the road, and democracy's in the middle, and everything's on the left and the right.
[01:40:33.831 --> 01:40:35.192]  And really, it's all the same system.
[01:40:35.212 --> 01:40:35.892]  There's no choice.
[01:40:35.972 --> 01:40:36.533]  It's an illusion.
[01:40:36.553 --> 01:40:40.896]  Because really, where would you put a constitutional republic and an anarchist on that political spectrum?
[01:40:41.216 --> 01:40:43.778]  It's more like a... Is that for Paul or for myself?
[01:40:44.558 --> 01:40:45.019]  That's for Paul.
[01:40:45.659 --> 01:40:46.199]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:46.740]  You want to take it?
[01:40:47.856 --> 01:40:54.158]  Well, the anarchist system is basically at one extreme end of the political spectrum.
[01:40:54.758 --> 01:40:59.359]  Republicanism is quite a way before that, but obviously before democracy.
[01:40:59.379 --> 01:41:01.900]  But again, this whole paradigm is staged.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.421]  It's about freedom or command and control.
[01:41:04.901 --> 01:41:07.501]  And you get these anarchists that call for, you know, revolution.
[01:41:07.521 --> 01:41:09.542]  It's about collectivism versus individualism.
[01:41:11.062 --> 01:41:13.103]  It's a Fabian society, basically, what we have.
[01:41:13.123 --> 01:41:16.344]  It's Fabian socialism that's being moved towards the left.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:22.922]  Yeah, the whole political spectrum of the world has been moving left for several decades.
[01:41:23.002 --> 01:41:36.066]  And the right acts like the money is against socialism, when in truth they finance it because they need a large government that they control the levers of to control the population and confiscate wealth and control society and set the parameters.
[01:41:36.086 --> 01:41:37.306]  But the real political spectrum
[01:41:37.992 --> 01:41:41.053]  You could put either point on the left or right, okay?
[01:41:41.073 --> 01:41:41.813]  Or it could be a circle.
[01:41:41.853 --> 01:41:46.114]  But on one end, you've got total command and control, a boot-stomping on the human face forever.
[01:41:46.474 --> 01:41:52.375]  On the other end, you have hunter-gatherers in loose-knit societies as close to anarchy as you're going to get.
[01:41:53.015 --> 01:41:55.536]  And it's impossible in groups of bigger than two to three people.
[01:41:55.596 --> 01:41:56.536]  You don't want anarchy.
[01:41:56.576 --> 01:41:57.716]  We're too complex a society.
[01:41:58.076 --> 01:42:06.758]  Very close to anarchy, about 90% towards it in the spectrum, is the Constitutional Republic, the rule of law.
[01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:11.609]  Then in the middle of that spectrum, you have your democracy.
[01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:26.373]  But once you hit the middle of the democracy, you're already in the gravitational pull of the tyranny, and you accelerate at light speed towards the heavenly body of tyranny that has a political gravitational vortex, or black hole function, sucking you towards it.
[01:42:26.653 --> 01:42:34.155]  So you've got to always try to escape from the command and control, like you're a spaceship, in an analogy, at full thrust.
[01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:43.207]  Racing towards anarchy, trying to reach the Republic, and then maintain the Republic, always being pulled back towards despotism, as our founding father said.
[01:42:44.406 --> 01:42:50.989]  Well then you've got all the anarchist useful idiots that are in fact propping up the agenda of the globalists.
[01:42:51.409 --> 01:43:11.657]  I mean, I even read an article the other day where the top, the main traffic, you know, anarchist websites, the biggest ones on the internet, will refuse any articles on Bilderberg because they see it as an anti-semitic right-wing conspiracy theory, when we had the BBC reporting just four days ago on it.
[01:43:11.677 --> 01:43:12.638]  Yeah, see, they put that label
[01:43:13.278 --> 01:43:17.661]  You know, we criticize Russia, China, New York, whoever, and then you say Israel's doing something corrupt.
[01:43:17.741 --> 01:43:18.441]  Oh, anti-Semitic!
[01:43:18.721 --> 01:43:31.969]  And so the anarchists are all wearing red stars, they're really communist, and then when you really got, you know, the founder of Bilderberg was an admitted top Nazi, Prince Bernhardt, and then, oh, you talk bad about him, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:43:31.989 --> 01:43:32.930]  See how that's just a label?
[01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:38.653]  Yeah, and I mean, BBC did a report on Bilderberg just four days ago, and BBC had
[01:43:39.309 --> 01:43:42.977]  You know, mainly center-left, as you would call it, on the controlled paradise.
[01:43:43.398 --> 01:43:46.444]  Yeah, but the anarchists, I mean, look, most of the anarchists are federal officers.
[01:43:46.484 --> 01:43:47.486]  I've had them tell me they are.
[01:43:47.506 --> 01:43:48.668]  I've had them threaten to kill me.
[01:43:48.688 --> 01:43:49.450]  They work for the feds.
[01:43:49.771 --> 01:43:50.312]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:51.437 --> 01:43:54.279]  That's why you see anarchist gear in all the malls now.
[01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:55.160]  They're pushing it.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:55.940]  It's communist.
[01:43:56.041 --> 01:43:57.702]  Okay, let's go ahead, because again, there's no difference.
[01:43:58.282 --> 01:44:03.426]  Let's go ahead and, you know, we were just talking about anarchy, you know, is what we're, you know, is on the other end of the political spectrum.
[01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:05.027]  This isn't real anarchy they're talking about.
[01:44:05.067 --> 01:44:06.108]  Again, it's about mislabeling.
[01:44:07.009 --> 01:44:08.330]  Randy in North Carolina.
[01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:09.130]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:09.531]  Go ahead.
[01:44:10.191 --> 01:44:16.756]  Sir, to all of our friends in Rhodesia, Australia, and you know all the rest of the country, sir.
[01:44:20.188 --> 01:44:29.772]  All I can say is, you people are trying to tell people who don't know what is going on, what is going on.
[01:44:29.792 --> 01:44:32.974]  And I'm totally and completely behind you there.
[01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:39.297]  Sweden, Norway, Finland, are they really in the know?
[01:44:40.537 --> 01:44:48.341]  Denmark, Germany, Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland,
[01:44:50.103 --> 01:44:51.285]  Do they know what's going on?
[01:44:53.088 --> 01:44:55.051]  Hey, I'm going to have to find out where you're going with this.
[01:44:55.111 --> 01:44:55.752]  Stay there, Randy.
[01:44:55.772 --> 01:44:59.257]  Then we've got Wyatt Dowling and Paul Watson, final segment.
[01:44:59.317 --> 01:45:04.004]  And I am going to throw out a few of the other headlines we haven't hit on, though we've covered most of them in the discussion.

[01:48:09.244 --> 01:48:11.148]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:48:11.649 --> 01:48:14.394]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:24.830]  We've got Katherine Ulbricht coming on.
[01:48:24.850 --> 01:48:32.792]  She's the head of Caspian, the group exposing how they give your data on your shopping carts, the Homeland Security, how they spy on you, the RFIDs.
[01:48:33.192 --> 01:48:47.456]  They've now gotten in with a password into stuff that was not really protected on the big Biometrics Consortium website, Walmart, Department of Defense, publicly are parts of it, and it talks about how they're going to dumb you down, how they're going to manipulate you.
[01:48:47.816 --> 01:48:49.296]  We've got it posted on the websites.
[01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:52.977]  And the documents posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:48:52.997 --> 01:49:05.301]  What they got off of the government's website, it's supposedly private, with Walmart and the Defense Department of how to quote neutralize the public's anger over this, how to manipulate the public.
[01:49:05.781 --> 01:49:09.002]  So that's coming up, and Watson's going to ride shotgun with us right now.
[01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:13.883]  Let's go back to the calls, and I'm going to hold our next guest off about eight minutes into the next hour so we can get to everybody.
[01:49:14.604 --> 01:49:18.565]  Randy in North Carolina, make your point real quick, then I'm going to go to Wyatt, Alan, Joan, and others.
[01:49:18.605 --> 01:49:19.225]  Go ahead, Randy.
[01:49:19.833 --> 01:49:21.054]  Hello Wyatt.
[01:49:22.135 --> 01:49:25.737]  Sir Paul, are you familiar with Alan Watt?
[01:49:26.998 --> 01:49:27.258]  No.
[01:49:27.858 --> 01:49:28.299]  You're not?
[01:49:29.019 --> 01:49:33.842]  Okay, but you're the same person insofar as it goes.
[01:49:34.163 --> 01:49:38.005]  Take my word for it, sir.
[01:49:38.025 --> 01:49:38.926]  We're all the same.
[01:49:38.946 --> 01:49:44.669]  We have to face the enemy and we have to defeat the enemy.
[01:49:47.148 --> 01:49:56.514]  And the next time these people over here in Europe and the rest of the world are freed, they will not be freed by United States military as it is right now, sir.
[01:49:56.854 --> 01:50:02.938]  They'll be freed by people like you and me and the gentleman that owns the air time right now.
[01:50:03.698 --> 01:50:05.319]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:50:05.439 --> 01:50:06.100]  I appreciate it.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.582]  They are going to be freed by free human beings that want to stand up against the new world order.
[01:50:09.622 --> 01:50:11.263]  But talking about the power of the people.
[01:50:12.432 --> 01:50:17.566]  Tens of millions of individual folks visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPilot.com every month.
[01:50:17.586 --> 01:50:18.509]  That's not an exaggeration.
[01:50:18.569 --> 01:50:19.251]  Tens of millions.
[01:50:20.408 --> 01:50:25.811]  Millions of different people coming back every week to turn into tens of millions and spreading the word.
[01:50:25.831 --> 01:50:27.172]  Dick Gephardt.
[01:50:27.612 --> 01:50:31.694]  Online supporters of Democratic presidential hopeful Dick Gephardt appear to have trouble organizing.
[01:50:32.054 --> 01:50:37.917]  Recent email exchanges reveal his official campaign tried to have a grassroots meeting, several of them online.
[01:50:38.417 --> 01:50:40.919]  When less than five people showed up, they canceled it.
[01:50:41.419 --> 01:50:47.002]  They can't even get five of their dumb minions, and Bush has trouble too, to meet up on some online chat.
[01:50:47.893 --> 01:50:53.779]  That shows their grassroots support, whereas we can't grow anymore because we're getting too many people visiting us.
[01:50:54.199 --> 01:50:58.203]  Paul, that shows that we've got the grassroots, they've got the illusion.
[01:50:58.343 --> 01:51:02.687]  I talk to big newspaper writers, they get one or two emails a day, I get thousands a day.
[01:51:03.088 --> 01:51:06.191]  We've got the people, they just haven't figured out their leaders yet, Paul.
[01:51:07.157 --> 01:51:11.421]  That's the point, and all the big mainstream news websites are now going to subscription.
[01:51:11.922 --> 01:51:20.350]  And it's not working out for them, because they're hit the dwindling week by week, and they hit the alternative websites that are going up in droves.
[01:51:21.111 --> 01:51:27.838]  And a new Gallup poll shows that only 32% of the American people trust the mainstream media, 80 plus percent trust the alternative media.
[01:51:29.016 --> 01:51:34.319]  Yeah, and we've also got a poll out of the London Times today which fits into the same context.
[01:51:34.599 --> 01:51:38.161]  There's voters losing faith in Blair over Iraq war.
[01:51:38.461 --> 01:51:42.283]  And 80 plus percent are against the national ID card and the Euro, but he doesn't care.
[01:51:42.975 --> 01:51:53.397]  But yeah, the government tried to suppress the votes against the National ID Card because they had a big online poll and it was 89% against or even more.
[01:51:53.457 --> 01:51:55.777]  Then they tried to claim they lost it, but it turned out they hadn't.
[01:51:55.797 --> 01:51:57.157]  Let's talk to Wyatt in Maryland.
[01:51:57.177 --> 01:51:57.918]  Wyatt, go ahead.
[01:51:57.938 --> 01:51:59.058]  How you doing, guys?
[01:51:59.118 --> 01:51:59.558]  Pretty good.
[01:51:59.658 --> 01:52:00.238]  Good afternoon.
[01:52:01.118 --> 01:52:09.000]  Listen, the independence day that came on the movie with Will Smith, it's a complete Illuminati New World Order movie.
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.700]  You have a common threat
[01:52:12.202 --> 01:52:20.911]  That global destruction by an outside enemy and then the entire world unites to defeat it.
[01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:38.904]  Also, the movie is completely and entirely filled with special effects, if you still frame it, frame by frame, with Illuminati symbolism, pyramids that are all through the movie... Well, I agree.
[01:52:38.984 --> 01:52:39.625]  Stay there a while.
[01:52:39.645 --> 01:52:41.046]  We'll let you finish up on the third hour.
[01:52:41.647 --> 01:52:42.848]  Watson, stay right there, my friend.
[01:52:43.808 --> 01:52:45.110]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:50.974]  If your station doesn't carry the third hour, ask them, please do, or get a sponsor so they'll carry the third hour.
[01:52:50.994 --> 01:52:51.535]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:54.142 --> 01:52:57.165]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:57.485 --> 01:53:02.409]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:05.192]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they have inhaled.
[01:53:09.035 --> 01:53:12.218]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.481 --> 01:53:21.122]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.782 --> 01:53:22.822]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.542 --> 01:53:24.682]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.302 --> 01:53:26.123]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.883 --> 01:53:28.803]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:28.823 --> 01:53:32.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.624 --> 01:53:36.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:39.985 --> 01:53:42.846]  As we ended the last segment in the second hour,
[01:53:44.284 --> 01:53:51.988]  Wyatt Maryland, who joins us, and my webmaster from PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson joins us, who are talking about Illuminati symbolism and conditioning.
[01:53:52.028 --> 01:54:01.314]  They admit that one of the former sub-directors of the CIA wrote the movie The Exorcist and put hidden images in the film, subliminals.
[01:54:01.354 --> 01:54:01.914]  That's admitted.
[01:54:03.215 --> 01:54:09.098]  The Toyota got caught in Europe having a satanic commercial with images about sacrificing children three years ago.
[01:54:09.118 --> 01:54:11.059]  A British firm produced the ads.
[01:54:11.119 --> 01:54:12.700]  That was in the Times of London and everywhere.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.023]  Gotta find that again, watch it and post it.
[01:54:15.423 --> 01:54:17.846]  But this new Matrix movie is full of subliminals.
[01:54:18.006 --> 01:54:19.769]  I was catching them just watching the film.
[01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:46.657]  uh... got nauseated watching it and uh... total new world order in your face revelation of the method the grand architect is the head of it you know the the masonic lucifer paradigm and then now these kids just like Harrison Kleibel wanted to go on a giant killing spree and were obsessed with the movie matrix and uh... Wyatt you were talking about independence day I got Reagan on video he did say an outside threat from another planet attacking us would unify us
[01:54:47.758 --> 01:54:49.599]  The Bilderberg Group has talked about this.
[01:54:49.739 --> 01:55:04.993]  I don't get into flying saucers and aliens, but the Kansas City Star and, before that, Wired Magazine reported that this Rothschild consultant, the former chief of staff for Clinton, are behind this, quote, disclosure project to tell us that the UFOs are real.
[01:55:05.033 --> 01:55:10.097]  That's Project Iron Mountain to, quote, have this outside threat to get us unified.
[01:55:10.117 --> 01:55:11.859]  So that is something that's in there.
[01:55:12.439 --> 01:55:17.601]  In their tool bag, they just haven't had the nerve to spring it yet, but they are trying to condition us to accept it.
[01:55:17.941 --> 01:55:19.321]  Any comments to that, Paul Watson?
[01:55:19.341 --> 01:55:20.242]  Then we'll go back to Wyatt.
[01:55:20.922 --> 01:55:21.342]  Well, yeah.
[01:55:21.502 --> 01:55:26.984]  You were talking about Independence Day and the fact that it's both UFO invasion, maybe stage.
[01:55:27.044 --> 01:55:30.025]  Obviously, this is going to be 10, 15 years down the line.
[01:55:30.725 --> 01:55:33.806]  But I've actually wrote an article on this many months ago.
[01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:35.527]  I've got the exact Reagan quote.
[01:55:35.967 --> 01:55:37.207]  I can play it right now.
[01:55:37.267 --> 01:55:39.208]  It's just a 16-second sample.
[01:55:39.228 --> 01:55:39.968]  You want to play it?
[01:55:40.603 --> 01:55:41.943]  Yeah, go ahead right now.
[01:55:41.983 --> 01:55:42.904]  Yeah, turn the volume up.
[01:55:42.944 --> 01:55:43.304]  Go ahead.
[01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:49.566]  I don't suppose we can wait for some alien race to come down and threaten us.
[01:55:50.086 --> 01:55:53.227]  Perhaps we need some outside universal threat.
[01:55:53.727 --> 01:56:01.409]  Our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.
[01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.990]  Did you get that?
[01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:06.091]  He said that in a State of the Union and before the UN.
[01:56:07.006 --> 01:56:08.107]  Yeah, before the U.N.
[01:56:08.387 --> 01:56:09.888]  General Assembly, September 87.
[01:56:11.369 --> 01:56:12.269]  So that's the U.N.
[01:56:12.309 --> 01:56:12.649]  quote.
[01:56:12.930 --> 01:56:14.230]  Wyatt, is that where you were going?
[01:56:15.931 --> 01:56:18.953]  What you have here is a total movie of Order Out of Chaos.
[01:56:19.633 --> 01:56:21.795]  And that's the theme.
[01:56:21.855 --> 01:56:23.496]  But what really got me was when...
[01:56:24.488 --> 01:56:30.289]  Got my interest peaking to look and go back and through this entire movie frame by frame in all the special effects.
[01:56:30.309 --> 01:56:34.810]  I don't care where it is, but wherever special effects are there, you have Illuminati symbolism.
[01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:42.271]  You have pyramids, you have the all-seeing eye in the pyramid, you have occultic symbols within the spaceships.
[01:56:42.671 --> 01:56:49.553]  Not only that, there's an American flag shown in one portion of the movie, and there's no stars in the field of blue.
[01:56:49.733 --> 01:56:51.333]  It's all just red, white, and the field of blue.
[01:56:51.893 --> 01:56:57.355]  There's no stars at all, which caught me, began me to go back and look at this movie.
[01:56:57.475 --> 01:57:00.237]  Total federalism, total command and control, thanks for the call.
[01:57:00.377 --> 01:57:00.697]  Okay.
[01:57:01.257 --> 01:57:02.077]  Good points.
[01:57:02.317 --> 01:57:04.518]  Allen in Kansas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:57:06.019 --> 01:57:06.319]  Hello.
[01:57:06.579 --> 01:57:06.979]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:14.423]  When we use the words New World Order and talk about New World Order, the word new is promotional.
[01:57:14.663 --> 01:57:15.963]  It sounds like it's something new.
[01:57:16.023 --> 01:57:17.684]  Old World Order.
[01:57:18.072 --> 01:57:19.012]  It's an old world order.
[01:57:19.072 --> 01:57:19.612]  I agree with you.
[01:57:19.852 --> 01:57:20.212]  It is.
[01:57:20.532 --> 01:57:22.313]  So very, very old.
[01:57:22.553 --> 01:57:27.894]  And I think we need to start explaining this to people every time we say, well, we don't agree with the new world order.
[01:57:27.934 --> 01:57:29.994]  It sounds like we don't agree with something new.
[01:57:30.554 --> 01:57:31.374]  And it's not new.
[01:57:31.735 --> 01:57:33.135]  It's not even about the world.
[01:57:33.195 --> 01:57:38.596]  It's about some kings and pseudo kings and princes and prince wannabes forming a syndicate.
[01:57:39.556 --> 01:57:41.096]  And it's not even very orderly.
[01:57:41.136 --> 01:57:42.316]  Look at what's going on today.
[01:57:42.457 --> 01:57:43.877]  Yeah, it's a criminal crime ring.
[01:57:43.937 --> 01:57:44.677]  It's pirates.
[01:57:46.777 --> 01:57:48.018]  Bushwhacking people.
[01:57:48.138 --> 01:57:48.498]  Stay there.
[01:57:48.518 --> 01:57:49.019]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:57:49.039 --> 01:57:50.180]  We're going to get our guest on.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:53.002]  But for Alan and Joan and others that are holding, just stay there.
[01:57:53.022 --> 01:57:53.902]  I'll get your calls early.
[01:57:54.082 --> 01:57:55.243]  Paul Watson, stay there as well.
[01:57:56.184 --> 01:58:05.751]  We've got the head of Caspian joining us to talk about some bombshell information that, believe me, you do not want to miss coming up here in the next segment.
[01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:08.993]  So everybody will definitely want to stay with us.
[01:58:09.253 --> 01:58:12.356]  We will be right back on the other side.
[01:58:12.976 --> 01:58:13.877]  InfoWars.com.
[01:58:15.305 --> 01:58:16.406]  Are you a diabetic?
[01:58:16.486 --> 01:58:17.827]  Do you know someone who is?
[01:58:17.887 --> 01:58:21.509]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money.
[01:58:21.789 --> 01:58:27.812]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.
[01:58:28.073 --> 01:58:32.155]  And if that's of interest to you, you need to know about R-Tex Medical.
[01:58:32.475 --> 01:58:36.658]  We'll ship your diabetes supplies right to your door at no cost to you.
[01:58:37.118 --> 01:58:43.822]  And we work with Medicare and Medicaid and even most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[01:58:44.022 --> 01:58:47.025]  Call now to confirm your eligibility.
[01:58:47.045 --> 01:58:47.605]  800-419-2335.
[01:58:48.786 --> 01:58:57.253]  Again, we are Artex Medical, and our commitment to you is to save you time, money, and hassles on receiving your diabetes testing supplies.
[01:58:57.533 --> 01:59:00.075]  There are no membership fees, no shipping costs.
[01:59:00.355 --> 01:59:03.478]  We even file all the insurance claims, so call 24 hours a day.
[01:59:03.498 --> 01:59:03.538]  800-419-2335.
[01:59:03.558 --> 01:59:03.598]  800-419-2335.
[01:59:03.618 --> 01:59:03.658]  800-419-2335.
[01:59:15.913 --> 01:59:18.076]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a new world order.
[01:59:18.196 --> 01:59:19.317]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:59:31.793 --> 01:59:36.015]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:36.095 --> 01:59:43.019]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:43.139 --> 01:59:45.220]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:55.945]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:56.145 --> 01:59:57.446]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:59:57.506 --> 01:59:57.846]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:00:16.468 --> 02:00:20.093]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:00:20.253 --> 02:00:24.639]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:00:24.839 --> 02:00:29.285]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[02:00:29.465 --> 02:00:32.389]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:37.370]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:41.531]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[02:00:41.771 --> 02:00:44.152]  And the aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[02:00:44.452 --> 02:00:48.333]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[02:00:48.553 --> 02:00:53.714]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[02:00:53.974 --> 02:00:56.895]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[02:00:57.075 --> 02:00:58.935]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[02:00:59.155 --> 02:01:01.796]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call toll-free.
[02:01:02.056 --> 02:01:03.817]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[02:01:03.977 --> 02:01:05.417]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[02:01:05.457 --> 02:01:05.717]  That's 877-605-9200.
[02:01:20.169 --> 02:01:20.810]  Big Brother.
[02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:22.512]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:23.252 --> 02:01:24.373]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:25.014 --> 02:01:25.815]  You want answers?
[02:01:26.596 --> 02:01:27.497]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:28.157 --> 02:01:32.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.341 --> 02:01:36.426]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:40.677 --> 02:01:42.898]  Catherine Ulbricht is our guest.
[02:01:43.178 --> 02:01:47.700]  She's degreed from Harvard, working on her doctorate in graduate work there.
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.922]  Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering.
[02:01:52.462 --> 02:02:06.287]  They've broken dozens of major stories about how these supermarket discount cards really rip you off, how they share and sell the data, the governments involved, RFIDs we've been covering here for years, the small radio frequency identification tracker tags,
[02:02:06.954 --> 02:02:10.397]  The Cashless Society, Control Grid, the Biometrics, all of it.
[02:02:11.337 --> 02:02:18.923]  And they have just broken a massive story, riding shotgun with us for another 30 minutes or so, is Paul Joseph Watson, my webmaster.
[02:02:19.324 --> 02:02:21.585]  He's also an author of Order Out of Chaos.
[02:02:22.726 --> 02:02:25.608]  He's joining us here, and I know we have some callers holding.
[02:02:25.628 --> 02:02:31.393]  Let me give you some background on this and read the Commworld July 8th news story today.
[02:02:32.603 --> 02:02:33.784]  We mentioned this yesterday.
[02:02:33.804 --> 02:02:42.431]  I also have another article here out of the Associated Press covering this, and another one out of Line 56 newspaper.
[02:02:43.312 --> 02:02:43.872]  A U.S.
[02:02:43.912 --> 02:02:59.485]  consumer group opposing the rollout of RFID tags has grabbed a bunch of documents from an RFID industry site and mirrored them, and we've posted them too on Infowars.com, and what it says is an attempt to expose the industry's intended publicity campaigns.
[02:02:59.785 --> 02:03:01.907]  The documents published here currently
[02:03:02.427 --> 02:03:03.287]  We're good to go.
[02:03:17.245 --> 02:03:34.336]  Uh, AutoIDCenter.com has already begun removing or replacing the documents discovered by Caspian and mirrored by CropTome.org while the RFID Journal has complained that Caspian has invaded the privacy of AutoIDCenter.com members.
[02:03:34.396 --> 02:03:43.402]  Well, you got the Department of Defense in there, you got FBI agents from our sources inside the Walmart RFID Center in a bunker.
[02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:45.423]  I mean, this is the Capitalist Society grid.
[02:03:46.357 --> 02:03:49.138]  Cryptome is going on.
[02:03:49.478 --> 02:03:52.438]  Off-air due to Slapshot.Effect.
[02:03:52.458 --> 02:03:59.000]  The documents cited by Cryptome, however, have been interpreted as evidence of negative attitude towards consumers.
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:08.562]  They speak of a need to pacify consumers when unfavorable RFID tagging news stories emerge and look for ways to, quote, neutralize opposition.
[02:04:09.102 --> 02:04:16.106]  The RFID industry has for some time focused on its publicity on supply chain issues and away from consumer tracking.
[02:04:16.486 --> 02:04:22.850]  Though earlier last year, Walmart told the USA Today that it was about tracking you, so that they've already been caught.
[02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:31.515]  Partly because of privacy concerns reflected in a survey in the Caspian documents, which shows 78% of consumers in America are worried that tags will invade their privacy.
[02:04:31.955 --> 02:04:36.158]  However, the industry is also to deal with considerable consumer ignorance and
[02:04:36.878 --> 02:04:48.429]  Scaremongering, for instance, the consumers fear that health impacts of RFID tags, presuming, I guess, the microwatts the tags momentarily use to communicate are somehow more dangerous than holding a more powerful transmitter against your ear.
[02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:49.490]  That's a good point.
[02:04:49.550 --> 02:04:50.651]  Cell phones are dangerous.
[02:04:50.711 --> 02:04:54.635]  I suggest you use a navigator, a little plug in your ear, and keep it away.
[02:04:54.655 --> 02:04:57.498]  A lot of people lay it in their lap and then get genital cancer.
[02:04:58.479 --> 02:04:59.660]  So that is true.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:03.485]  It's a lot more dangerous, folks, to have a cell phone than one of these RFID tags.
[02:05:03.865 --> 02:05:07.950]  Microscopic transmission is just with the waves hitting it and reading it.
[02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:15.559]  But joining us is the founder and head of Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion.
[02:05:16.329 --> 02:05:18.972]  And numbering, and she's Catherine Albrecht.
[02:05:19.372 --> 02:05:21.394]  And we're so honored to have you on the show, Catherine.
[02:05:21.414 --> 02:05:22.155]  Good to have you with us.
[02:05:22.335 --> 02:05:22.795]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:22.875 --> 02:05:24.097]  Always a pleasure to be on with you.
[02:05:24.317 --> 02:05:28.881]  Had you on just two weeks ago, and you're getting more and more documents as you do more and more interviews.
[02:05:28.901 --> 02:05:30.142]  You've been on around the world.
[02:05:30.643 --> 02:05:31.564]  This is a big deal.
[02:05:31.604 --> 02:05:33.205]  I know you've got copies of the documents.
[02:05:34.146 --> 02:05:37.689]  Tell us exactly what you've discovered in the incredibly arrogant statements.
[02:05:37.749 --> 02:05:41.273]  But frankly, from when you were on three weeks ago, you heard similar statements.
[02:05:41.954 --> 02:05:46.799]  And a lot of biblical references when you were up in Chicago at their big consortium meeting.
[02:05:47.219 --> 02:05:53.906]  Yeah, well, you know, the thing that's been happening is behind the scenes since 1999 when this Auto-ID Center first got founded.
[02:05:53.946 --> 02:06:02.775]  And to put this in perspective for your listeners, by the way, the Auto-ID Center, the folks who had this gaping security hall where we were able to just go in and see all these embarrassing and confidential documents,
[02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:11.240]  They're actually, you know, it could be argued that they are one of the most powerful organizations in the world right now in terms of futuristic technology.
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:12.922]  Well, they're connected to all the people.
[02:06:12.982 --> 02:06:16.304]  Walmart got the barcode to become universal in the 80s.
[02:06:16.524 --> 02:06:21.507]  They're doing it again by them forcing all of their manufacturers to adopt this.
[02:06:21.547 --> 02:06:22.508]  This will become universal.
[02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:23.389]  You've got it.
[02:06:23.429 --> 02:06:33.600]  Walmart being one of the sponsors of the Auto ID Center, it's comprised of now more than a hundred different organizations and companies, product manufacturers, retailers all around the world.
[02:06:34.101 --> 02:06:41.629]  They have gotten together and for, as I said, the last three years have been meeting secretly behind closed doors in these meetings having discussions
[02:06:41.789 --> 02:06:44.510]  And that is the definition of racketeering, I will say it.
[02:06:44.871 --> 02:06:50.554]  They are colluding to change industry and to make us accept the new system with additional costs as well.
[02:06:50.834 --> 02:06:55.036]  This is racketeering, setting up a new industry, and then it has the privacy implications.
[02:06:55.276 --> 02:07:02.960]  Well, and the problem here is it would be one thing if they were meeting behind closed doors to talk about, oh, I don't know, new forms of forklifts or something to develop for the warehouse.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:09.603]  But what they have developed is something that has the potential to influence every single human being on the planet.
[02:07:09.663 --> 02:07:11.004]  And they say that in their documents.
[02:07:11.064 --> 02:07:16.107]  Tell us about the new documents and how you got them and then we're going to get Paul Watson's response to this.
[02:07:16.467 --> 02:07:24.291]  Well, we have, it's kind of funny, we first stumbled across this huge gap in their website security back in the spring.
[02:07:24.731 --> 02:07:25.392]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:07:42.054 --> 02:07:50.323]  Confidential these documents were and I'm talking about lengthy lists with emails of everyone who's participated in their meetings with telephone numbers.
[02:07:50.343 --> 02:07:52.104]  Corporate chieftain's home addresses.
[02:07:52.645 --> 02:07:55.148]  Yeah, I mean that level of detail.
[02:07:55.228 --> 02:07:56.569]  Department of Defense goodies.
[02:07:56.629 --> 02:08:00.533]  In fact, a Canadian researcher has found a bunch of NSA stuff posted.
[02:08:01.794 --> 02:08:03.116]  It's like their Northwoods document.
[02:08:03.156 --> 02:08:05.077]  I don't know if you've ever heard of Northwoods, but it's a U.S.
[02:08:05.117 --> 02:08:07.099]  government terror plan thing that got leaked.
[02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:08.340]  They admit it's accurate.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:12.164]  It talks about hijacking jet airliners to crash them to blame on foreign enemies.
[02:08:12.204 --> 02:08:19.791]  I mean, the stuff that gets leaked by government and quasi-government, tell us about the group and exactly who's in it and what's in the documents.
[02:08:20.171 --> 02:08:30.618]  Well, these documents contain everything from board meetings that are confidential, secret PowerPoint presentations that they have given to, say, everyone from the Department of Transportation.
[02:08:30.999 --> 02:08:34.841]  It has references to meetings with Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge.
[02:08:35.382 --> 02:08:40.125]  It has references to trials, actual store-level trials where they're putting these
[02:08:40.686 --> 02:08:44.048]  ...tagging devices into actual products that people are taking home with them.
[02:08:44.408 --> 02:08:50.432]  This has been vehemently denied in the media, and yet these internal documents openly state and specify that this is happening.
[02:08:50.492 --> 02:08:54.054]  This is massive, and you talked about it at the public meeting in Chicago.
[02:08:54.094 --> 02:09:05.120]  They said, if we can get Homeland Security to endorse this for security, now they're saying they want all the cows and sheep to have this, federal inspectors, a whole new level of bureaucracy, a security clearance to have any job.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:06.781]  I mean, this is their control grid.
[02:09:06.801 --> 02:09:10.423]  Remember, I talked about Ridge on C-SPAN last year, last time you were on, Katherine.
[02:09:10.763 --> 02:09:11.924]  I have him on tape on C-SPAN.
[02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.105]  I've got to dig the tape out.
[02:09:13.125 --> 02:09:18.308]  And I watched this live, and he was meeting with corporate heads, and he talked about this control grid.
[02:09:18.888 --> 02:09:33.637]  Well, and I think that this is one of the concerns, is that, you know, the companies involved in this would tell you that their only concern is better efficiency in the supply chain, that they're only worried about warehouses and, you know, transporting things more efficiently.
[02:09:33.677 --> 02:09:35.098]  But now he's meeting with Ridge.
[02:09:35.618 --> 02:09:43.940]  Yeah, and one of the things that you'll see on here, and let me just re-read that quote that I mentioned last time we were on together, Alex, and this is a quote by Larry Kellum.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:48.281]  He's the Director of B2B Supply Chain Innovation for Procter & Gamble.
[02:09:48.661 --> 02:09:55.842]  He gave a whole presentation about how item-level tagging is going to be the future of RFID.
[02:09:56.222 --> 02:10:04.324]  Now, item-level tagging is actually putting one of these tiny remote transmitter chips on every consumer product manufactured in the world.
[02:10:05.481 --> 02:10:05.981]  The clothing?
[02:10:06.382 --> 02:10:07.722]  Well, woven into the clothing.
[02:10:07.963 --> 02:10:15.247]  Well, woven into the clothing or potentially pressed right into plastic in bottles and products as they come off the shelves.
[02:10:15.267 --> 02:10:16.208]  Gillette already has it.
[02:10:16.248 --> 02:10:17.709]  Michelin already has it in the tires.
[02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:19.290]  Well, Gillette is testing it.
[02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:26.534]  They've been putting it in the packaging, but the potential is quite large that they would put this right into... I mean, for some things, the packaging may as well be the product.
[02:10:26.575 --> 02:10:27.915]  Now it's in the Michelin tire.
[02:10:30.498 --> 02:10:35.445]  Yes, and we have seen schematic diagrams, and that has been going forward to the best of my knowledge.
[02:10:35.465 --> 02:10:38.188]  Let me stop you, Catherine, because we've got Paul Watson here, and we're so honored to have you.
[02:10:38.208 --> 02:10:45.398]  I know I'm jumping in a lot, just adding 10 minutes, and I want to get into what the documents actually say in the next segment, but let's bring Paul Watson, our researcher from England, on.
[02:10:45.458 --> 02:10:47.841]  Paul, any comments to what Catherine's saying?
[02:10:48.632 --> 02:10:57.761]  Well, you mentioned the first interview with Catherine, and anyone can go online and listen to that now at prisonplanet.com in the audio section, June 20th interview.
[02:10:58.202 --> 02:11:09.914]  But also, we posted just yesterday a picture which one of our Prison Planet columnists actually took personally from Walmart, and it reads, and you can go online and see this now,
[02:11:10.615 --> 02:11:21.660]  To our valued customers, for your protection, and to bring you low prices, we use closed circuit televisions and electronic merchandise tagging systems.
[02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:24.061]  And that picture's on prisonplanet.com right now.
[02:11:24.302 --> 02:11:25.702]  So there they are trying to push it.
[02:11:25.742 --> 02:11:26.803]  Catherine, what do you say to that?
[02:11:27.003 --> 02:11:27.883]  Well, you know, it's true.
[02:11:28.103 --> 02:11:33.966]  And the problem here with Walmart is that they're putting these hidden reader devices in shelves and in floor tags.
[02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:36.287]  We actually have a document that states this is happening now.
[02:11:36.327 --> 02:11:39.669]  They have vehemently denied it in interviews with reporters.
[02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:45.292]  So they're scanning you as you walk around inside the store, and you said the cameras watch you when you pick up the Gillette razors?
[02:11:45.592 --> 02:11:48.073]  Well, that is one of their stated plans, absolutely.
[02:11:48.133 --> 02:11:59.118]  And let me give you a list of products that we have a document right here that specifies, at Walmart, in Phase 3 testing, they are testing Caress Soap, Right Guard Aerosol Deodorant,
[02:11:59.591 --> 02:12:05.697]  Pantene shampoo, Huggies, baby wipes, Coca-Cola 2 liter bottles, and of course Gillette products.
[02:12:06.058 --> 02:12:13.385]  Now, when you look at this document that talks about Walmart doing this, it actually says that for each of these products, they're doing a shelf read.
[02:12:13.745 --> 02:12:17.048]  Now, a shelf read means actually reading the items on the shelf.
[02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:20.632]  So this means that the tags must be in the items themselves in order to do that.
[02:12:20.692 --> 02:12:21.293]  And that's big.
[02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:23.435]  They're in the items themselves, and they said they weren't doing that.
[02:12:24.165 --> 02:12:26.149]  Well, one of the other ones is a floor reader.
[02:12:26.189 --> 02:12:28.934]  There's a reference to a floor read for Coca-Cola.
[02:12:29.475 --> 02:12:34.846]  And the question we are now raising is we actually, I have in my possession right here, right now, a pair of shoes.
[02:12:35.416 --> 02:12:47.442]  by the company, a company called Footstar, and right on the tag it says, attention, our products have theft detection devices embedded, which will be deactivated at the register or at the service desk.
[02:12:47.882 --> 02:12:52.384]  So if you combine that with floor readers, you have the potential to read people through their shoes.
[02:12:52.924 --> 02:13:02.589]  After they leave, and in San Francisco they're using an RFID to begin taxation off the toll roads, turning the entire city into toll roads, San Mato times, three weeks ago.
[02:13:03.129 --> 02:13:04.770]  Stay there, riveting information,
[02:13:05.890 --> 02:13:06.951]  Absolutely important.
[02:13:07.011 --> 02:13:10.453]  Gotta boycott them now before they put it in everything and there's no escaping it.
[02:13:10.713 --> 02:13:14.115]  Then they'll make it the law that every product has to have it unified in the supply chain.

[02:15:19.076 --> 02:15:23.619]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.863]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:29.244 --> 02:15:31.025]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:31.065 --> 02:15:32.106]  can barely be read.
[02:15:32.386 --> 02:15:33.347]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:33.707 --> 02:15:37.608]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[02:17:12.454 --> 02:17:13.255]  Bookmark it today.
[02:17:18.343 --> 02:17:24.365]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:17:24.965 --> 02:17:27.966]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:29.906 --> 02:17:33.307]  Joan, Bob, Bill and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:17:33.347 --> 02:17:34.527]  We're talking to Catherine Albrecht.
[02:17:35.248 --> 02:17:37.388]  She is the founder and head of Caspian.
[02:17:37.448 --> 02:17:40.249]  She is a grade from Harvard and also about to get her doctorate there.
[02:17:41.255 --> 02:17:43.176]  Started a few years ago, Caspian.
[02:17:43.356 --> 02:17:44.676]  It's done incredible work.
[02:17:45.077 --> 02:17:47.778]  Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering.
[02:17:47.838 --> 02:17:49.798]  I start hyperventilating when we talk about this.
[02:17:50.539 --> 02:17:52.780]  This is the cashless society control grid.
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:55.401]  Department of Defense is a member of this.
[02:17:55.421 --> 02:17:56.641]  Ridge involved.
[02:17:57.301 --> 02:17:59.502]  Total control grid of everything you do.
[02:18:00.143 --> 02:18:01.903]  Cashless society taxation.
[02:18:01.963 --> 02:18:03.064]  That's what this is all about.
[02:18:03.584 --> 02:18:08.306]  And now they went to their website and the idiots had whole areas that were accessible that said
[02:18:08.966 --> 02:18:30.716]  You know, classified, not for distribution, internal, and going over these documents, and Paul Watson, jump in any time, these documents you've gotten, Catherine, are just bombshell, and of course you've got them and excerpts of them on your website, and we'll talk about that in a few minutes, and how folks access them.
[02:18:30.736 --> 02:18:32.397]  We have a link to it on InfoWars.com.
[02:18:34.077 --> 02:18:35.138]  What else is in the documents?
[02:18:35.178 --> 02:18:38.400]  I mean, not just how they're already in the shoes and stuff and going to read you.
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:49.967]  I mean, there was a Washington Post article last year saying they already have pressure plates and cameras that read your eye movement, how long you watch something for psychological algorithms to be built, psychological dossiers on us.
[02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:51.308]  That was in the Washington Post.
[02:18:51.328 --> 02:19:02.355]  I don't know if you saw that article where they admitted all this, but what about their statements about pacifying us and about neutralizing opposition and manipulating the public?
[02:19:02.375 --> 02:19:03.196]  Can you tell us about that?
[02:19:03.456 --> 02:19:14.427]  Sure, I think one of the big problems that the Auto ID Center and hence all the over 100 companies affiliated with it have right now is they have an enormous problem with consumers right now.
[02:19:15.388 --> 02:19:22.195]  78%, as you mentioned earlier, 78% of consumers that they studied in their own internal documents
[02:19:22.828 --> 02:19:23.129]  I think?
[02:19:38.058 --> 02:19:42.101]  So they've got a big problem and their big problem is called a public relations nightmare.
[02:19:42.481 --> 02:19:49.465]  So they have called in heavy hitter PR firm Fleishman Hillard to devise a PR strategy for them.
[02:19:49.986 --> 02:19:51.747]  And one of the things, they've actually done two things.
[02:19:52.027 --> 02:19:54.989]  They called in Fleishman Hillard to say, come up with a PR strategy for us.
[02:19:55.029 --> 02:20:02.694]  The second thing, they actually studied a whole bunch of consumers all around the world in Japan, Germany, England, the United States, France.
[02:20:03.054 --> 02:20:07.417]  And what they found was in every case that the people they surveyed did not like the technology.
[02:20:08.177 --> 02:20:28.802]  In that particular document, Helen Deuce, who is their researcher over there in England, she actually comes right out and says, well, and in fact at the November board meeting where all these guys got together again behind closed doors to talk about this, she presented the results of the study and from what I have been told, her comment was, well, we've got some good news and some bad news.
[02:20:28.842 --> 02:20:31.823]  The bad news is that people really don't like this technology.
[02:20:32.443 --> 02:20:33.623]  That's the results of my study.
[02:20:33.663 --> 02:20:36.424]  The good news is that it appears they will be apathetic.
[02:20:37.307 --> 02:20:43.292]  And they will not know what to do about it unless someone comes along and motivates them and wakes them up.
[02:20:43.352 --> 02:20:44.113]  Exactly.
[02:20:44.473 --> 02:20:48.517]  People don't like the New World Order, but they all feel like they're alone, even though we're the majority.
[02:20:49.037 --> 02:20:49.818]  It's gun control.
[02:20:49.898 --> 02:20:50.919]  It's all the issues.
[02:20:51.219 --> 02:20:56.704]  The people want their liberties and their freedoms, but they feel disempowered and don't really have all the power.
[02:20:56.744 --> 02:20:57.605]  That's my frustration.
[02:21:00.247 --> 02:21:03.372]  We've got to really promote Caspian and we've got to get the word out.
[02:21:03.412 --> 02:21:07.378]  I know I've been talking about RFID for five years, TexMars for eight years people.
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:12.385]  Watson, got any ideas on how to get the word out on this other than this show?
[02:21:13.638 --> 02:21:14.038]  Well, yeah.
[02:21:14.278 --> 02:21:22.164]  I mean, Catherine mentioned the fact that this same system is being implemented in, you know, what we call the Echelon countries, specifically my country.
[02:21:22.664 --> 02:21:27.387]  But people in this country say, oh well, we haven't got a Walmart over here, so they're not introducing it.
[02:21:27.427 --> 02:21:31.650]  But Walmart, in fact, owned the major supermarket store over here, which is Asda.
[02:21:32.031 --> 02:21:35.613]  But it's the same system being implemented across all those countries.
[02:21:35.953 --> 02:21:36.774]  It's interesting that
[02:21:37.469 --> 02:21:53.068]  We're talking about these documents that have just been released that lay the groundwork and the quote I read out of one of the stories that came out today is that these companies talked about how they would manage the release of negative stories about RFID which mirrors
[02:21:53.743 --> 02:21:54.824]  So now they've got a direct apathy.
[02:21:54.864 --> 02:21:57.226]  I mean, think about how arrogant they are to you and your family, folks.
[02:22:14.117 --> 02:22:14.678]  Catherine?
[02:22:15.038 --> 02:22:21.223]  Let me tell you one of the ways that this is actually a strategic, an element of their strategic plan, is to encourage apathy.
[02:22:21.604 --> 02:22:32.833]  One of the things in the Fleshman-Hiller document, or one of the many Fleshman-Hiller documents we have obtained, they actually say, emphasize in all public communications with the press, the inevitability of this technology.
[02:22:33.554 --> 02:22:37.997]  So emphasize, you know, it's coming, it's inevitable, there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.
[02:22:38.198 --> 02:22:39.379]  What does the board say?
[02:22:42.725 --> 02:22:44.246]  Resistance is futile!
[02:22:44.746 --> 02:22:46.247]  Resistance is futile!
[02:22:46.627 --> 02:22:47.928]  Resistance is futile!
[02:22:48.328 --> 02:22:49.529]  Lay down, G.I.
[02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:51.510]  He won't be seeing you, sweetheart.
[02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:53.311]  Lay down, Tokyo Rose said.
[02:22:54.051 --> 02:22:55.872]  Watch and do about five more minutes with us on the other side.
[02:22:55.992 --> 02:22:58.994]  And, and, and, and... Head of Caspian, stay right there, Catherine.
[02:22:59.154 --> 02:23:00.175]  Amazing information.
[02:23:00.195 --> 02:23:03.797]  I want to hear more about these secret documents you've gotten and how they're panicking.
[02:23:03.817 --> 02:23:04.537]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:06.198 --> 02:23:07.119]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.599 --> 02:23:09.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.112 --> 02:23:12.853]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.735 --> 02:23:19.636]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:19.836 --> 02:23:25.299]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.579 --> 02:23:26.999]  Ideal for track 4327.
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:31.922]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the National Line at 877-996-4327.
[02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:48.963]  We're talking to Catherine Albrecht.
[02:23:48.983 --> 02:23:51.248]  We've got my webmaster from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.912]  All Joseph Watson.
[02:23:52.932 --> 02:23:54.075]  You'll be hearing him more on the show.
[02:23:54.115 --> 02:23:54.716]  His upcoming book.
[02:23:55.698 --> 02:23:57.620]  Order Outta Chaos that I'm publishing.
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:00.542]  I know we got Joan and Bob and Bill and others that are holding.
[02:24:00.562 --> 02:24:01.823]  Your calls are coming up in a few minutes.
[02:24:01.863 --> 02:24:03.844]  I am hyperventilating over this issue.
[02:24:03.864 --> 02:24:06.546]  This is such a key area in the fight for liberty.
[02:24:06.587 --> 02:24:11.510]  It's like open borders, gun control, RFID, cashless society, biometrics.
[02:24:11.851 --> 02:24:17.575]  These are all the top, most important issues, strategic things we've got to stop the globalists from putting in.
[02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.997]  And, Paul Watson, I'm giving you a mission, my friend.
[02:24:20.017 --> 02:24:25.221]  I don't just want an audio file of this interview with Catherine up on the website.
[02:24:26.196 --> 02:24:36.881]  I am asking our listeners, three or four of you that do this, calling all cars, I want a transcript of this interview posted because Greg Pallast and others at the BBC have posted them.
[02:24:37.641 --> 02:24:41.163]  The transcripts of this show get published in major newspapers around the world.
[02:24:41.283 --> 02:24:44.965]  I don't know why I guess the interviews are so insightful with these great guests.
[02:24:45.545 --> 02:24:50.027]  Listeners, you know who you are, email it to Watson, okay?
[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:54.061]  Because at the time, we get so many thousands a day, sometimes I won't see it the first day.
[02:24:54.161 --> 02:25:02.663]  Email it to tips at infowars.com and what's in the transcript of this, where should they email it to you to get it posted so millions of listeners can email it out to folks?
[02:25:03.903 --> 02:25:08.504]  Listeners can email it to paul at propaganda matrix dot com and I'll get that.
[02:25:09.725 --> 02:25:13.205]  Alright, and we'll publish it under the Prison Planet headline.
[02:25:13.505 --> 02:25:14.566]  This is so important.
[02:25:14.746 --> 02:25:16.806]  Catherine, I know I'm jumping in over you.
[02:25:16.906 --> 02:25:18.367]  I get out of control on this subject.
[02:25:18.427 --> 02:25:19.507]  It makes me so mad.
[02:25:20.382 --> 02:25:25.305]  Because I read them years ago saying what they would do with this taxation, control, tracking.
[02:25:25.345 --> 02:25:26.546]  You've got the internal documents.
[02:25:26.947 --> 02:25:43.158]  Before we go any further and go to these calls, who got the incredible idea at Caspian to go to the site, to snoop around, not hack it, but just look around and find their classified documents of this governmental quasi-private group setting up this racketeering takeover?
[02:25:45.139 --> 02:25:49.422]  How did you get in and get this and tell us about some of the other secret documents you've gotten?
[02:25:49.870 --> 02:26:06.703]  Well, let me tell you, Alex, what I think is the most disturbing part of this whole thing is that here are the people who reassure us that we can trust them to put these tagging devices in everything we come in contact with, that we can trust them because they are going to use Internet security.
[02:26:06.743 --> 02:26:13.408]  And this is actually a quote from one of their documents, their public relations documents out to the public saying, hey, you know, well, what about security?
[02:26:13.428 --> 02:26:19.553]  Isn't that going to be an issue when you put RFID tags in everything and you're tracking everything through the Internet and through these massive databases?
[02:26:19.933 --> 02:26:23.355]  Their response has been, uh, you don't have to worry about that.
[02:26:23.415 --> 02:26:24.796]  We've got security under control.
[02:26:24.856 --> 02:26:27.678]  Internet security is very strong and very powerful.
[02:26:27.698 --> 02:26:28.759]  And then you go to their website.
[02:26:28.779 --> 02:26:30.540]  And your private data will be collected, protected.
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:34.823]  So I go to their website and on the search, you go right to the front page of AutoIDCenter.org.
[02:26:35.803 --> 02:26:38.525]  Right there, you will see a little search window.
[02:26:38.565 --> 02:26:39.906]  You can type in any words you want.
[02:26:40.666 --> 02:26:41.847]  Well, now they've cleaned it up.
[02:26:41.867 --> 02:26:43.328]  They've sanitized it since yesterday.
[02:26:43.668 --> 02:26:50.753]  But for many months, and potentially even years, you could type in whatever you wanted and you would get access to their internal documents.
[02:26:51.193 --> 02:26:53.474]  These people do not have a clue about security.
[02:26:53.794 --> 02:26:58.256]  They do not have the first idea of how to protect their own sensitive information.
[02:26:58.297 --> 02:27:01.238]  Well, Catherine, Catherine, now they're going to tie us all into this grid.
[02:27:01.278 --> 02:27:09.542]  They're the people, this same grid, same companies, Walmart and others, that had pushed for the social security numbers as an identifier everywhere now.
[02:27:09.962 --> 02:27:13.804]  They admit that has caused the proliferation of identity theft.
[02:27:14.464 --> 02:27:21.927]  And now they're opening a bigger Pandora's box and they'll offer more tracking and tracing and I mean this is incredible.
[02:27:22.107 --> 02:27:32.290]  I have to say the amount of, I mean the idea of leaving these bozos in charge of my personal data being collected on me everywhere I went through RFID tags is enough to send chills down my spine.
[02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:33.771]  I'm not just talking about
[02:27:34.111 --> 02:27:41.797]  Massive corporations or government entities that might want to use it against me, but I'm talking even, you know, you don't even have to be a hacker to access this kind of information.
[02:27:41.817 --> 02:27:46.521]  Any criminal could go online, if they had everything online, and, you know, download anything they wanted about you.
[02:27:46.541 --> 02:27:47.081]  This is nuts.
[02:27:47.101 --> 02:27:48.582]  These people don't know what they're doing.
[02:27:48.842 --> 02:27:50.624]  We can't trust them with our security.
[02:27:50.904 --> 02:27:51.825]  They are dangerous.
[02:27:51.885 --> 02:27:54.426]  They are dangerous because they don't see the future they're creating.
[02:27:54.747 --> 02:27:58.850]  They are dangerous because they don't take reasonable, even common sense, precautions.
[02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:02.734]  Even to protect their own selves, which is where, you know, clearly they have an interest in that.
[02:28:03.054 --> 02:28:09.341]  A criminal can also scan boxcars, warehouses, homes, and find out what you've got inside.
[02:28:09.361 --> 02:28:16.208]  They admit that a lot of these can transmit over distances between 2 feet and 100 yards is what I've read in the mainstream news.
[02:28:16.468 --> 02:28:28.201]  And remember, this all comes on the heels of the Total Information Awareness Network getting announced by the convicted felon, Admiral Poindexter, with their all-seeing-eye logo of the Pyramid.
[02:28:28.542 --> 02:28:35.009]  And the Pentagon said, everything you buy, you sell, your email, what you say, will be put in this grand database.
[02:28:35.029 --> 02:28:35.750]  That's a quote.
[02:28:36.270 --> 02:28:39.691]  And then now you've got Ridge and these documents meeting with them.
[02:28:39.891 --> 02:28:44.913]  You go to their public meetings and they say, we've got to get Homeland Security to be behind this and pushing it.
[02:28:45.493 --> 02:28:47.434]  Tell us about those secret documents, please.
[02:28:47.834 --> 02:28:59.257]  Well, the quote I wanted to read you about Larry Kellum said, if we get a declaration from Homeland Security that this is the step we need to take to protect the food supply, that's the step that will move this technology forward.
[02:28:59.297 --> 02:29:00.618]  We're already hearing that out of Ridge.
[02:29:01.198 --> 02:29:08.700]  And that was in reference to item-level tagging, which means putting remote tracking devices on every item in the food chain.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:11.160]  And you said you got shoes that already have this in it?
[02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:12.120]  That is correct.
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:16.281]  I was sent these shoes by someone who purchased them in Hawaii, of all places.
[02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:20.562]  She got concerned because she saw this tag on them and sent them to us.
[02:29:20.642 --> 02:29:27.423]  Now, the company that manufactures these shoes, we have not yet, by the way, x-rayed the shoes to find out if we have the tag in there.
[02:29:27.443 --> 02:29:30.764]  If anyone has access to an x-ray machine and would like to volunteer it to us,
[02:29:31.124 --> 02:29:32.226]  You're up in Harvard country.
[02:29:40.715 --> 02:29:41.596]  I'm down in Texas.
[02:29:41.636 --> 02:29:44.057]  My dad is a dentist and oral surgeon.
[02:29:44.097 --> 02:29:47.018]  I've got skull x-rays that would scan those nicely.
[02:29:47.299 --> 02:29:48.599]  Well, hey Alex, I'll send them your way.
[02:29:48.619 --> 02:29:49.820]  You can post them on your website.
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:54.182]  You can be the first to get the information out about whether we've found tracking devices in shoes or not.
[02:29:54.202 --> 02:29:55.363]  Be sure and ensure that.
[02:29:55.563 --> 02:29:58.845]  I will call you when I get off air and give you the address to send it.
[02:29:58.865 --> 02:30:02.046]  And I will, within a day of getting those, have them x-rayed.
[02:30:02.407 --> 02:30:06.669]  And then, do you want me to dig out with tweezers the chip itself and then maybe scan that as well?
[02:30:06.789 --> 02:30:09.211]  Well, you know, it would be interesting to know what exactly they've put in there.
[02:30:09.291 --> 02:30:16.978]  And again, for your listeners who may have just tuned in and missed that portion, I have in my possession a pair of Size 7 Soho shoes.
[02:30:16.998 --> 02:30:20.741]  These are women's sandals in an extruded kind of a foam plastic.
[02:30:21.201 --> 02:30:23.023]  On them there is an attached tag that says,
[02:30:23.676 --> 02:30:25.597]  www.footstar.com.
[02:30:25.737 --> 02:30:26.238]  Attention!
[02:30:26.398 --> 02:30:33.562]  Our products have theft detection devices embedded which will be deactivated at the register or the service desk.
[02:30:34.183 --> 02:30:38.826]  Now that could simply be an electronic, some other type of electronic article surveillance device.
[02:30:38.906 --> 02:30:40.146]  It could be an RFID chip.
[02:30:40.266 --> 02:30:41.487]  At this point we do not know.
[02:30:41.847 --> 02:30:44.109]  What we do know though is that this company
[02:30:44.569 --> 02:30:45.229]  I think so.
[02:31:12.034 --> 02:31:14.516]  The first and second phases are now complete.
[02:31:14.897 --> 02:31:31.871]  They are now in the middle of Phase 3, and Phase 3 is item-level tagging, among other things, meaning putting these into individual items, seeing how consumers interact with them, seeing how the stores and readers interact with them, seeing what happens when they try to read many dozens of things at a time on a shelf in a store.
[02:31:32.271 --> 02:31:37.276]  Here are the products, and I hope we do get a transcript of this, because I would like this to be made public.
[02:31:37.776 --> 02:31:39.758]  Here are the products that are being tagged
[02:31:40.225 --> 02:31:41.425]  Currently, it says Summer of 2003.
[02:31:41.485 --> 02:31:47.508]  Procter & Gamble is tagging Bounty Towels and Pantene Shampoo.
[02:31:48.208 --> 02:31:51.969]  It says Cape Girardieu Factory, Iowa City, D.C.
[02:31:52.629 --> 02:31:54.050]  That means Distribution Center.
[02:31:54.350 --> 02:31:58.531]  So Bounty Towels and Pantene Shampoo coming out of there may well be tagged.
[02:31:58.991 --> 02:32:01.192]  Gillette Mach 3, 16-pack.
[02:32:01.973 --> 02:32:04.713]  Right Guard Aerosol Deodorant, 10-ounce cans.
[02:32:04.874 --> 02:32:05.994]  That's coming out of Chicago.
[02:32:06.904 --> 02:32:11.887]  Unilever, a major consumer products company, produces these products that will be tagged.
[02:32:12.128 --> 02:32:15.170]  Liquid All Detergent Caress Soap.
[02:32:15.430 --> 02:32:16.811]  That is coming out of Baltimore.
[02:32:17.531 --> 02:32:20.873]  Johnson & Johnson is tagging Carefree.
[02:32:21.334 --> 02:32:22.735]  I'm not sure what Carefree is.
[02:32:23.255 --> 02:32:26.637]  Also Bedtime Bath out of Olive Branch.
[02:32:27.578 --> 02:32:33.822]  Kraft Foods is tagging Maxwell House Coffee and Kraft Cheese Slices out of Fort Worth.
[02:32:34.562 --> 02:32:40.586]  And Coca-Cola is tagging 2 liter bottles of Coke and then it has a comma and it says 8-pack tray.
[02:32:40.966 --> 02:32:42.907]  That is out of Cleveland, Tennessee.
[02:32:43.367 --> 02:32:44.428]  It says bottler there.
[02:32:44.848 --> 02:32:53.533]  Now when I look at another chart here from their internal documents, it says Caress soap 6-pack, Pantene shampoo 750 milliliter bottle.
[02:32:54.614 --> 02:33:02.098]  On the right, it says Walmart running vertically down between all of these products, meaning that these are all being tested at Walmart right now.
[02:33:02.702 --> 02:33:04.764]  It says unit and case aggregate.
[02:33:04.844 --> 02:33:10.469]  Now that would mean potentially that they're talking about backroom supply side in the warehouse.
[02:33:10.810 --> 02:33:12.131]  But next to it is the concern.
[02:33:12.191 --> 02:33:13.252]  It says shelf read.
[02:33:13.793 --> 02:33:19.218]  Shelf read means putting the individual products on the shelf and making sure you can read each individual product.
[02:33:19.538 --> 02:33:21.280]  And here's the one that has me the most concerned.
[02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:22.441]  Coca-Cola.
[02:33:22.821 --> 02:33:24.763]  It says shelf and floor read.
[02:33:25.444 --> 02:33:42.051]  Now, floor readers, I think, are one of the biggest concerns we face with this technology, Alex, because it has already been demonstrated through research that has been done, associated with the Auto-ID Center, that these reader devices can be embedded into floor tiles and carpet, meaning that if
[02:33:42.890 --> 02:33:50.656]  Now, and by the way, the read range on these, the read range really doesn't go beyond about 20, 30 feet unless you put a battery in it or unless you hack around a little.
[02:33:51.337 --> 02:34:00.804]  The read range typically is, I would say, between 5, 10, 15 feet in that area, but the more powerful devices have a shorter read range in some cases.
[02:34:01.224 --> 02:34:09.831]  Now, if you can put RFID tags into shoes, and if you can get away with hiding them in shoes, and you have reader devices in floors,
[02:34:10.509 --> 02:34:14.391]  Then there just went away your read range problem of 20-30 feet to track people.
[02:34:14.451 --> 02:34:22.094]  You simply put down a mat at the entrance of your store, or wherever it is you want to track people, and you take a read right off their shoes.
[02:34:22.334 --> 02:34:28.216]  In the Washington Post article last year, and Paul, when you dig all these up and post them in the story when we do a transcript,
[02:34:29.378 --> 02:34:44.208]  They said that pressure plates will read what you're buying, tiny cameras, and I know somebody at UT who works for the CIA and the psychology department, Department of Defense funded, it's all about retina readers that read void comp, like Blade Runner, type movements in the eyes.
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:35:07.948]  Get your psychological read off something you read on a package, and it talks about scanning and tracking you, and the store Prada said they're going to already have this in stores in New York, is what they said, where you go in, you buy something, next time you come in, they face scan you, they know what you bought last time, or if you're wearing the RFID, it reactivates it, and then they can custom tailor things to you.
[02:35:08.388 --> 02:35:09.268]  Did you hear about that?
[02:35:09.548 --> 02:35:14.650]  Well, you know, that's really the idea, is to find ways to custom-tailor things to individuals to identify them.
[02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:17.251]  I have in my possession... That's what they claim on the surface, yeah.
[02:35:17.411 --> 02:35:26.975]  Well, I have in my possession a prototype loyalty card that actually contains within it an RFID tag that can be read right through your purse, backpack, or wallet.
[02:35:27.015 --> 02:35:35.278]  Well, they have the IBM ad a few years ago where the guy, you think he's stealing food, he's putting it in his jacket, he walks out, the security guard comes over and says, sir, your receipt.
[02:35:35.658 --> 02:35:36.099]  Exactly.
[02:35:36.139 --> 02:35:48.210]  Now in that case though, the reader device in the doorway has read the products that he's carrying and presumably also read some identifier of him so that those products could be deducted from his payment system, whatever that is.
[02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:51.773]  That's an IBM ad for this new chip credit card.
[02:35:51.994 --> 02:35:53.835]  Paul Watson, any comments to what she's saying?
[02:35:54.496 --> 02:35:59.681]  Yeah, just to throw this in now, we actually had an article on PrisonPlanet.com last week where
[02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:04.312]  One of these RFID tags was actually discovered in women's underwear.
[02:36:04.332 --> 02:36:07.173]  So we've got all these products on top of each other.
[02:36:07.433 --> 02:36:21.219]  But the question that I wanted to put to Catherine is about Benetton because we know that Catherine led a successful campaign against Benetton, to boycott Benetton, against putting RFID tags in clothes.
[02:36:21.259 --> 02:36:28.923]  But we recently had an article out of the RFID Journal, which is the main propaganda organ of RFID,
[02:36:29.603 --> 02:36:42.256]  Where Mauro Benetton actually stated that his company were ongoing with the test for RFID and that that original back down to the successful campaign against them was just a smokescreen.
[02:36:42.276 --> 02:36:52.726]  Yeah, Catherine, that question and then also the quotes here out of the news where you have the documents that talk about quote neutralizing opposition, pacifying consumers,
[02:36:54.489 --> 02:36:55.970]  Answer his question and mine, please.
[02:36:56.471 --> 02:36:56.871]  Well, let's see.
[02:36:56.911 --> 02:37:10.523]  The issue with Benetton is that Benetton, I think, was astonished at the speed and power of the firestorm that consumed them when they made the announcement that they were going to be embedding RFID remote tracking devices in clothing labels.
[02:37:10.854 --> 02:37:12.815]  Now, that is absolutely over the line.
[02:37:12.936 --> 02:37:15.617]  I think everyone who heard the story agreed.
[02:37:15.637 --> 02:37:19.240]  They were inundated with press requests from as far away as Tasmania.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.121]  I was on Swedish public radio.
[02:37:21.161 --> 02:37:24.223]  We've been featured all over France, Australia, all over the world.
[02:37:24.324 --> 02:37:26.385]  People went nuts when they heard about this.
[02:37:26.805 --> 02:37:40.375]  Now, what I did not realize at the time, apparently, is that Mauro Benetton, a member of the Benetton family, is also deeply involved with a company called LabID that is developing and promoting this label tagging technology.
[02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:48.257]  And so apparently our boycott against Benetton caused a big family rift in the Benetton family.
[02:37:48.297 --> 02:37:50.219]  This is what I've been told from inside sources.
[02:37:50.919 --> 02:37:57.485]  That Malraux Benetton apparently had put in about $15 million to developing this RFID technology and investing in it.
[02:37:58.065 --> 02:38:04.931]  And was going to apparently use his family's company Benetton as one of the first examples of bringing it to market.
[02:38:05.516 --> 02:38:11.561]  And when the rest of the Benetton family heard what had happened, or we're right in the middle of this firestorm, they said, you know what?
[02:38:11.641 --> 02:38:12.842]  I don't care what you've invested.
[02:38:12.882 --> 02:38:14.083]  We are pulling back from this.
[02:38:14.123 --> 02:38:15.243]  This is dangerous stuff.
[02:38:15.544 --> 02:38:16.925]  We are going to get clobbered in the market.
[02:38:16.945 --> 02:38:18.166]  I don't care if they pull back.
[02:38:18.266 --> 02:38:24.330]  Benetton, we must target them just like Smith & Wesson when they tried to do this sneaky anti-gun move a few years ago.
[02:38:24.370 --> 02:38:26.212]  I don't care if they sell it, what they do.
[02:38:26.532 --> 02:38:27.793]  We must salt the earth.
[02:38:28.313 --> 02:38:28.954]  Anyone.
[02:38:29.274 --> 02:38:29.834]  Walmart.
[02:38:29.975 --> 02:38:30.455]  Everyone.
[02:38:30.495 --> 02:38:31.916]  We must boycott them 110% all of them.
[02:38:33.337 --> 02:38:36.960]  You know who I want to call for the biggest boycott of all against is Gillette.
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:43.006]  I think that Gillette is one of the most despicable companies I have ever come in contact with in working with this technology.
[02:38:43.586 --> 02:38:45.908]  I personally was in a Brockton Walmart.
[02:38:45.928 --> 02:38:48.751]  Now this is another story I'll give you a little exclusive on here.
[02:38:49.631 --> 02:38:58.099]  I went into the Brockton Walmart after reading in the Boston Globe a few weeks ago that they were going to begin their shelf level tagging test the following week.
[02:38:58.499 --> 02:39:01.542]  So I drove, you know, an hour and so down there to get to the store.
[02:39:01.882 --> 02:39:02.742]  I went into the store.
[02:39:02.823 --> 02:39:05.004]  It was in a predominantly minority community.
[02:39:05.625 --> 02:39:15.633]  That was the first thing that struck my notice, so that, for example, if people felt that their privacy had been violated, there wouldn't be a whole lot of Manhattan lawyers potentially shopping there to sue them.
[02:39:15.713 --> 02:39:18.455]  Yeah, disenfranchised groups are always tested on first.
[02:39:18.715 --> 02:39:23.999]  And I had several lengthy conversations with a family who spoke Spanish.
[02:39:24.039 --> 02:39:31.023]  I am also fluent in Spanish, so I was able to... They were also fluent in English, but we conversed in both languages about their concerns about this technology.
[02:39:31.524 --> 02:39:34.866]  I was interacting in that store, I would say, for over two hours.
[02:39:35.126 --> 02:39:37.348]  I spent a great deal of time in front of that shelf.
[02:39:37.748 --> 02:39:44.312]  I even purchased a disposable camera at Wal-Mart, and I took photographs of that shelf, which I now have in my possession.
[02:39:44.692 --> 02:39:47.274]  Now, the astonishing thing to me is that given that there's been 110
[02:39:48.715 --> 02:39:49.955]  Absolutely amazing!
[02:39:49.975 --> 02:39:52.916]  Paul Watson, comments, then we're going to calls.
[02:40:13.644 --> 02:40:23.299]  Yeah, and as I said, we've got a big picture on PrisonPlanet.com of a six foot sign at Walmart saying RFID is for your safety, but another thing I wanted to mention is that
[02:40:24.373 --> 02:40:28.017]  Catherine was talking about the Google hits on the term RFID.
[02:40:28.037 --> 02:40:38.706]  You don't be surprised if they actually change the terminology for that because we've seen that with programs like Total Information Awareness being changed to Talon and Lysol.
[02:40:38.746 --> 02:40:40.027]  Paul, what an excellent point.
[02:40:40.047 --> 02:40:40.808]  Can I jump in here?
[02:40:40.828 --> 02:40:41.068]  Sure.
[02:40:41.088 --> 02:40:49.135]  You know, one of the things we uncovered in this strategy document by Fleischmann-Hillard was they actually have toyed around with the idea of calling these green tags.
[02:40:49.455 --> 02:40:51.516]  Safer, better, smarter, something like that.
[02:40:51.816 --> 02:40:56.038]  You know, actually promoting them is this wonderful thing that's somehow going to make the world better.
[02:40:56.358 --> 02:41:00.660]  And you know, I saw that and I thought, you know, that is really, that is such a stretch.
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:09.483]  And you know, I really hope they do something like that because that means they would take a public splash, they would take this public, and believe me, the public would be on them like white on rice.
[02:41:09.643 --> 02:41:14.745]  Well, that's really stupid because green tag is something even easier to get across to people.
[02:41:14.925 --> 02:41:16.606]  RFID is kind of a hard concept.
[02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:18.763]  I want to go to Joan, Bob, and Bill.
[02:41:18.783 --> 02:41:25.450]  I'm going to give you each about a minute on the other side with our guest, Catherine Albrecht, and give you out her website as well.
[02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:27.192]  I want to thank you for joining us, Paul Watson.
[02:41:27.633 --> 02:41:27.973]  Okay.
[02:41:28.013 --> 02:41:28.494]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:41:28.634 --> 02:41:29.155]  Take care, bud.
[02:41:29.195 --> 02:41:29.955]  I'll talk to you soon.
[02:41:29.996 --> 02:41:31.477]  Catherine, one final segment with you.
[02:41:31.497 --> 02:41:33.279]  We'll come back and take three final calls.
[02:41:33.299 --> 02:41:34.601]  Let you hit on some final tidbits.
[02:41:36.457 --> 02:41:40.804]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.984 --> 02:41:45.411]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.571 --> 02:41:49.958]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.998 --> 02:41:51.320]  The New World Order.
[02:41:53.112 --> 02:41:57.334]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.394 --> 02:42:04.318]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:04.458 --> 02:42:06.439]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:07.900]  We're good to go.
[02:42:36.144 --> 02:42:46.870]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:42:47.051 --> 02:42:54.675]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.895 --> 02:42:58.037]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:58.297 --> 02:43:04.079]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:43:04.319 --> 02:43:10.481]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:43:10.841 --> 02:43:14.742]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:43:14.782 --> 02:43:16.663]  The water level is always visible.
[02:43:16.863 --> 02:43:22.805]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:43:23.025 --> 02:43:26.747]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:44:25.180 --> 02:44:26.402]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:26.462 --> 02:44:27.483]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:48.727 --> 02:44:50.749]  Harassing the lies and disinformation.
[02:44:51.030 --> 02:44:56.435]  Exposing the giant prison grid being built for you and your family as they laugh at you and talk about how apathetic you are.
[02:44:57.076 --> 02:44:59.518]  Want to learn more about RFID tracker systems?
[02:45:00.159 --> 02:45:04.463]  We covered it in Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, and Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:45:05.264 --> 02:45:08.387]  In fact, we detail it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:45:09.071 --> 02:45:10.573]  Call toll free to get my films.
[02:45:10.613 --> 02:45:12.875]  Get big discounts when you get three or more of the nine videos.

[02:45:47.254 --> 02:45:49.455]  Catherine, what about the website for Caspian?
[02:45:49.495 --> 02:45:51.296]  How do folks visit the website and get more informed?
[02:45:51.436 --> 02:45:55.919]  You can find us online at www.nocards.org.
[02:45:56.039 --> 02:46:03.023]  We are No Cards because we originally started fighting supermarket cards, which are just a drop in the bucket compared to the data you can collect with RFID.
[02:46:03.383 --> 02:46:04.624]  You can find us online there.
[02:46:04.744 --> 02:46:07.205]  You can also do a Google search under Caspian.
[02:46:07.245 --> 02:46:09.786]  We usually come up as the first or second hit on that search.
[02:46:09.827 --> 02:46:12.368]  You can find us there easily if you can remember we are called Caspian.
[02:46:12.748 --> 02:46:16.670]  My email address is KMA at NoCards.org.
[02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:18.291]  Okay, NoCards.org.
[02:46:18.331 --> 02:46:18.991]  Let's take a call.
[02:46:19.051 --> 02:46:19.731]  Quickly, callers.
[02:46:19.991 --> 02:46:20.652]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:20.712 --> 02:46:21.452]  Joan in Florida.
[02:46:21.472 --> 02:46:22.072]  You're on the air.
[02:46:22.092 --> 02:46:23.833]  Uh, yes, Alex.
[02:46:24.193 --> 02:46:27.295]  Uh, out of a regular newspaper, Tampa Tribune.
[02:46:28.395 --> 02:46:29.456]  Uh, our opinion.
[02:46:29.916 --> 02:46:31.737]  It was June 15th.
[02:46:32.337 --> 02:46:36.599]  So they can go tbo.com and research this article.
[02:46:37.159 --> 02:46:37.779]  Our opinion.
[02:46:37.859 --> 02:46:39.740]  New science of radio tags.
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.421]  Hold promise, comma.
[02:46:41.826 --> 02:46:43.109]  Threatens privacy.
[02:46:43.971 --> 02:46:51.027]  And it also talks in here on this about the tag car could be taxed based on where and when you drive your car.
[02:46:52.638 --> 02:46:56.900]  Wow, give me that article and please email it to Catherine.
[02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:59.782]  So, Tampa Tribune saying it'll be used to tax cars.
[02:47:00.162 --> 02:47:04.986]  Already happening with a little bit more sophisticated transponder in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[02:47:05.126 --> 02:47:05.906]  Interesting, Catherine.
[02:47:06.466 --> 02:47:12.610]  Absolutely, and you know, the limits of what this will be used for are just the limits of the human imagination.
[02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:17.494]  If they can find a reason for collecting the data, this technology will enable them to do it.
[02:47:17.534 --> 02:47:17.874]  And Alex,
[02:47:18.288 --> 02:47:24.527]  You know, you talk about a number of other concerns about illegal immigration, about police brutality and other issues.
[02:47:25.003 --> 02:47:32.168]  I'm telling you, no matter what your concern is, envision that the people doing the oppressing have access to this technology.
[02:47:32.468 --> 02:47:42.415]  And you will see why this affects all of us, no matter what your freedom issue or your personal issue, no matter what it is, RFID will take that issue and bring it to a whole new level of bad.
[02:47:42.435 --> 02:47:42.876]  Amazing!
[02:47:42.896 --> 02:47:44.357]  That is why we must oppose this.
[02:47:44.377 --> 02:47:44.797]  Amazing!
[02:47:46.018 --> 02:47:50.121]  I've got a document in here in front of me real quick I want to tell you about, Alex, because before we get off the air here.
[02:47:50.401 --> 02:47:53.223]  This is Department of Defense Applications of Auto-ID.
[02:47:54.185 --> 02:47:59.088]  And this is a Mr. Kimball from the Auto-ID who was speaking at a meeting.
[02:47:59.108 --> 02:48:00.909]  They're going to make the Iraqis wear it.
[02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:02.309]  I'd like to read you something here.
[02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:07.412]  Mr. Kimball described four projects which the Department of Defense is pursuing related to Auto-ID.
[02:48:08.673 --> 02:48:09.874]  Most of these are pretty innocuous.
[02:48:09.894 --> 02:48:13.996]  The Department of Defense needs to know the location of materials at all stages of its life cycle.
[02:48:14.296 --> 02:48:15.116]  Got about a minute left.
[02:48:15.457 --> 02:48:21.720]  Alright, the final one, this is the one at the end, it says Mr. Kimball mused on future applications including a telepathy tag.
[02:48:22.355 --> 02:48:33.824]  VeggieTag does not exist, nor can we guess how it might work, but the point is that the Department of Defense is careful not to go down a course of action that precludes adoption of a new technology when that technology becomes feasible.
[02:48:34.204 --> 02:48:35.205]  A telepathy tag?
[02:48:35.905 --> 02:48:36.426]  What is that?
[02:48:36.626 --> 02:48:37.226]  It's insane.
[02:48:37.266 --> 02:48:37.747]  Real quick.
[02:48:37.807 --> 02:48:38.507]  Bob in New York.
[02:48:38.527 --> 02:48:39.188]  Thanks for holding.
[02:48:39.208 --> 02:48:39.989]  You got 30 seconds.
[02:48:40.029 --> 02:48:40.429]  Go ahead.
[02:48:42.637 --> 02:48:43.318]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:48:43.618 --> 02:48:50.785]  My training is in electronics, and there is a device called a degausser stick, or a degaussing device.
[02:48:51.245 --> 02:48:54.629]  It's used in the picture tube industry or TV set industry.
[02:48:55.305 --> 02:49:00.028]  If you just search degaussing coil on the internet, I'm sure you'll be able to find it.
[02:49:00.388 --> 02:49:04.751]  You just can't use that device around any electronics or it'll blast it.
[02:49:05.212 --> 02:49:07.813]  It will blast out those RFID tags.
[02:49:08.054 --> 02:49:09.174]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:49:09.214 --> 02:49:10.936]  Sorry to Bill and others that we're holding.
[02:49:10.956 --> 02:49:11.616]  I apologize.
[02:49:11.656 --> 02:49:12.016]  Call me back.
[02:49:12.036 --> 02:49:14.458]  If you're listening, please go to our website at NoCards.
[02:49:14.478 --> 02:49:15.098]  We need you.
[02:49:15.118 --> 02:49:16.739]  We are organizing local chapters.
[02:49:16.859 --> 02:49:17.200]  Join us.
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:18.981]  Hit the feedback form and please sign up.
[02:49:19.301 --> 02:49:20.263]  Oh, Catherine, that's great.
[02:49:20.283 --> 02:49:21.725]  And I'm going to call you after the show, okay?
[02:49:22.025 --> 02:49:22.506]  Absolutely.
[02:49:22.646 --> 02:49:23.988]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:24.028 --> 02:49:24.648]  Tell your friends.
[02:49:24.668 --> 02:49:25.470]  God bless you all.
[02:49:27.512 --> 02:49:30.617]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[02:49:30.897 --> 02:49:32.279]  The Sanjin 505P shortwave
