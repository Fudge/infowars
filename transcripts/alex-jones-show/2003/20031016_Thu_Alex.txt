[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.061]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:15.203]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:16.903]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:18.724]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:20.184]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:21.904]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:26.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:29.046]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:30.807]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:38.010]  I tell you folks, this week is exploding past us.
[00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.652]  It's already the 16th of October 2003 on this Thursday Transmission Against Tyranny.
[00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:51.394]  And we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.974 --> 00:00:58.216]  We have one of the organizations that's out front defending the life of Terry
[00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:04.547]  Shendler Schiavo, who they, well, they pulled her feeding tube in Florida yesterday.
[00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:08.389]  She's been denied any type of rehabilitation for 10 years.
[00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:20.656]  10 years ago, when she first had her mysterious heart attack and had broken bones, she was not given any treatment under orders of her husband, and she was talking and
[00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.262]  Showing a lot of signs that she could totally recover then.
[00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:30.763]  Now she opens and closes her eyes, cries and mumbles when she sees her mother, her father.
[00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:35.164]  She's obviously conscious and not comatose or vegetative.
[00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.685]  But they're going to kill her.
[00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:44.867]  And within 50 hours of them pulling the tube yesterday at about noon, there will be a
[00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:47.745]  Irrevocable damage.
[00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:54.508]  So we've got about, I don't know, 30-40 hours left until she's in serious trouble.
[00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:58.129]  She's had infections that they refuse to treat as well.
[00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.010]  It's horrible.
[00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:04.292]  And so in the next hour, we've got folks involved with the case.
[00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:07.514]  We've had the family and of course their lawyers on, but we've got the
[00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:15.034]  Some of the folks involved on the front lines of exposing this and fighting this coming on the show.
[00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:25.356]  In fact, a gentleman who is paralyzed from the neck down himself, who's been out there fighting the murder of disabled people.
[00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:36.398]  And by the way, on Monday, and she may be dead by then, on Monday we have Wesley Smith coming on the big Wall Street Journal, writer, the best-selling author, culture of death.
[00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:50.059]  Who lists dozens of names, there's hundreds, but he'll go over dozens of stories of those that have been talking, begging, please feed me, audibly, feed me, please, no, as they're murdered brutally.
[00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.140]  This is your new America.
[00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:55.142]  Of course you don't know about it because the news won't tell you.
[00:02:55.162 --> 00:03:00.725]  When you read the Associated Press, they say that Skiavo is a total vegetable.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.421]  Which is an absolute lie.
[00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:08.388]  There is video of her just a month ago that's been released of her blinking her eyes and crying when she sees her mommy.
[00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.036]  And imagine the parents are going to have to watch her, watch her death, her murder that's now taking place.
[00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:23.244]  Imagine, this is akin to crucifixion where you're basically denied food and water.
[00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:30.174]  And, uh, for some people who are conscious, when they take the ventilator off, it's, it basically is crucifixion.
[00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:32.575]  Uh, suffocating someone.
[00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:39.337]  The massive torture this woman's gone through in ten years, uh, is, uh, well, horrible.
[00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.397]  But, uh, I've got news of U.S.
[00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:44.718]  troops' battle at Iraq-Syrian border.
[00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.519]  Senators joined forces to roll back parts of Patriot Act.
[00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:49.820]  It's already been repealed in the House.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.381]  Smallpox vaccination plan has been completely terminated.
[00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:55.255]  That's what they're claiming.
[00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:59.857]  Remember, everybody, all the police and firefighters and medical workers had to take it.
[00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:02.598]  99.99% refused.
[00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:04.719]  And, uh, they're having to back off.
[00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.159]  Major massive victory.
[00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.160]  Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporting.
[00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:13.362]  Matrix system would put privacy on endangered list.
[00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:14.462]  Yeah, the Matrix system.
[00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:15.343]  We'll talk more about that.
[00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:16.863]  I first reported on this about two months ago.
[00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:17.564]  Three months ago.
[00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:21.245]  Workers strike over Big Brother monitoring system.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.020]  That's in England.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.721]  In Canada, people are protesting and filing lawsuits over biometrics, saying it's part of a control grid.
[00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.822]  The CHICOM astronaut got back, and we'll talk about that.
[00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:35.883]  Got back from space, orbiting the Earth.
[00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:42.665]  Because it hurdles through space, and study wrong impressions helps support Iraq War.
[00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:46.965]  The vast majority of Americans believe that Saddam was behind September 11th.
[00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.986]  I know that was the White House that did that.
[00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:50.825]  And the Survey U.S.
[00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:52.346]  Troops Suffering Low Morale.
[00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:53.768]  Look, it's a big show.
[00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:55.589]  Want to know what's going on?
[00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.572]  Creme de la creme of important info.
[00:04:58.972 --> 00:04:59.873]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:04.397]  It's been updated at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:05.017 --> 00:05:05.898]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:07.700]  So strap yourselves in and get ready.
[00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:14.450]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.077]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:23.604]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:24.986]  The New World Order.
[00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:30.989]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:37.972]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:40.153]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.513 --> 00:05:50.819]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:53.640]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.484]  My new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!

[00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:03.422]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:15.305]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:19.749]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:20.589]  We listened.
[00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:25.893]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:26.654]  We listened.
[00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:30.076]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:31.037]  We listened.
[00:07:31.497 --> 00:07:34.019]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:36.404]  We listened.
[00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:42.009]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:43.771]  Again, we listened.
[00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:51.518]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:13.094]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:16.496]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:25.182]  Bringing you the rants, the analysis, the global outlook.
[00:08:26.182 --> 00:08:27.243]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:28.304]  I do this
[00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:32.902]  Little show, this transmission against tyranny with billions of listeners globally.
[00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:35.805]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:36.585]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:41.570]  Central Standard Time during the day and then of course 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.652]  You go out on the AM and FM dial, coast to coast.
[00:08:44.752 --> 00:08:47.695]  Simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 and at night at 5.085.
[00:08:52.553 --> 00:09:09.402]  I'm going to launch into the escalation with Syria and Iran because I end up never covering this in proper scope as it develops the last two weeks.
[00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:14.344]  I got a bunch of news about Terri Schiavo Schindler who they've pulled her feeding tube.
[00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:16.245]  Just another precedent-setting case here.
[00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:18.667]  We've got folks involved with the case coming on the second hour.
[00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:21.148]  We've already had her lawyers and parents on a few weeks ago.
[00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:25.009]  Got a bunch of good news about the Patriot Act in deep trouble.
[00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:26.931]  Looks like the Senate may actually vote to repeal it.
[00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:30.034]  And then Lord Bush is going to have to veto it.
[00:09:30.054 --> 00:09:32.276]  The liberal he is, to use the common term.
[00:09:33.577 --> 00:09:34.578]  That's all coming up.
[00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:39.223]  You know, I want to do this on air because I care about my friends and family.
[00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:44.449]  And I just thought that it's important to do.
[00:09:46.244 --> 00:09:57.572]  I have an employee who's been a family friend of my parents, and he works for a major Fortune 500 company here in town, and he part-time works for us about three days a week in data entry.
[00:09:58.393 --> 00:10:01.775]  He's worked for us for about a year and a half, and I've known him since I was a little kid.
[00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:13.003]  His name's Ronnie, and he's over 50 years old, and he was diagnosed with some advanced melanoma on his back.
[00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:18.259]  And there's a 50-50 chance that it's treatable.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.283]  They've told him a good chance he's going to die and they're telling him they want him to go on chemotherapy.
[00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:29.107]  They cut a big chunk out of his back and had already sent off some tentacles into his body.
[00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:32.630]  Hadn't gotten the lymph nodes though from biopsies they did there.
[00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:39.240]  And if the listeners would just pray for Ronnie, that would, I know, help.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.061]  I know it works.
[00:10:40.241 --> 00:10:42.442]  They've done major studies, major universities.
[00:10:42.962 --> 00:10:52.567]  I don't need major studies and major universities to tell me the power of prayer, going to God and asking that He intercede if that's His will.
[00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:58.690]  I mean, it may be in His plan that I die tomorrow, that Ronnie dies six months from now, that you die in a car wreck today.
[00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:01.272]  That may be needed in a chain of events in the plan.
[00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:15.288]  If it is God's will, I ask that Ronnie have a speedy recovery and that he make the right decisions and that his doctors' hands be guided, the doctors' and nurses' hands be guided in the work they're doing with him.
[00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:21.189]  So it's very sad, but you know, this shows us life.
[00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:22.969]  We could all die in a car wreck today.
[00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:24.470]  We could all be struck by lightning.
[00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.210]  We could die in a flood or an earthquake.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.201]  Uh, we could, uh, have a heart attack.
[00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:31.222]  You know, people who are 25 have heart attacks.
[00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:32.602]  You could have a stroke tomorrow.
[00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:35.584]  And it shows us how short this life is.
[00:11:35.624 --> 00:11:40.245]  And in this sick world, they teach us that, you know, the guy that dies with the most toys wins.
[00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:40.946]  And that's a lie.
[00:11:41.346 --> 00:11:48.989]  The person that dies with the best family, who's done the right thing in their life, that's loved God, stood up to tyranny, uh, that has, uh,
[00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:55.234]  Well, been as decent as they could, and that has had a proper moral bearing.
[00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:56.815]  That's what matters.
[00:11:57.195 --> 00:12:02.019]  What the old Norse saying, cattle die and kinsmen die, and someday one must die oneself.
[00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:05.642]  But I know there's one thing that never dies, and that's the fame of a dead man's deeds.
[00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:08.584]  But it's more than the fame of a dead man's deeds.
[00:12:08.664 --> 00:12:15.329]  Civilization is here because of the bold sacrifice, because of the courage of men and women.
[00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:20.400]  Because of the adversity that our ancestors went through, no matter what color you are.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.041]  And no, the man who dies with the most toys does not win.
[00:12:26.602 --> 00:12:40.907]  The person that leaves something for their children, the person that is a hero is the individual that sacrifices and works hard for decency and honor and courage and duty.
[00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:46.477]  And who stands up against the wickedness and who faces the reality of the world.
[00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:51.978]  In fact, they say moral courage is a more scarce commodity than physical courage.
[00:12:53.278 --> 00:13:08.662]  They've done major psychological tests, but philosophers thousands of years ago had already pointed this out, that it takes more courage to go against the general malaise, the general insanity of decadent phases in society.
[00:13:09.584 --> 00:13:18.647]  It takes more courage to do that, to say the world is round, as Galileo did, than it takes to charge a machine gun nest.
[00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:30.151]  But, not having moral courage, and not having the will to face painful truths, is a great psychological and spiritual illness.
[00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:40.011]  Another definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, thinking you'll get the same results, thinking you'll get different results.
[00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:43.354]  I mean, thinking that, well, NAFTA and GATT have destroyed our economy.
[00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:50.501]  Here, let's meet in two days in Miami for the Free Trade Group of the Americas, for the Free Trade Area, and let's expand it radically.
[00:13:51.923 --> 00:13:53.264]  All right, let me get into the news.
[00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:55.967]  This first, or I won't get to it.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:21.172]  I talked about my TV show Tuesday night, and I was in the studio doing, I was talking about the UPI article that was posted in a newspaper in Colorado, Colorado Daily, about little tables that are going to run for hundreds of miles, and they've got infrared, audio, video, ground penetrating radar, and they list a lot of the article.
[00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:24.714]  I actually went to the university getting the federal funding and looked at the actual devices.
[00:14:25.658 --> 00:14:28.520]  And they zip along at upwards of 50 miles an hour on these cables.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:36.824]  The cables will be based in cities, of course, tied into cell towers that the feds admit will be pods of control and surveillance with cameras and other devices.
[00:14:37.124 --> 00:14:42.346]  But the cables will leave armored command bases built around cell towers.
[00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:43.767]  This is the federal plan.
[00:14:43.787 --> 00:14:54.833]  And they will stretch out into rural areas, into the woods, the plains, into the mountains, the hills, over the creeks, through the rivers, down over the lakes.
[00:14:56.198 --> 00:14:57.719]  They will watch everything you're doing.
[00:14:57.739 --> 00:15:01.321]  I mean, you talk about the next level of Super Big Brother.
[00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:02.822]  The drones are now in the skies.
[00:15:03.283 --> 00:15:18.152]  They are now ordering over a hundred dirigibles, blimps, zeppelins, whatever you'd like to call them, to be bristling with ground-penetrating radar, to be tethered 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, over your cities, looking through your walls, tethered at 20,000 feet.
[00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:20.514]  It's nightmarish.
[00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:27.081]  And, uh, one of the crew came in and handed me a Statesman article from Saturday.
[00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:29.342]  Excuse me, that was another article from Saturday.
[00:15:29.382 --> 00:15:30.503]  This is from Sunday, October 12, 2003.
[00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:35.686]  And it said, want to star in a trashy movie?
[00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:42.430]  Travis County is mounting cameras to record those who jettison their junk in the great outdoors, in rural areas, and in the woods.
[00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.933]  And then above it, I just totally, see, it's every, everything is tyranny.
[00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.874]  The article right above this,
[00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:54.349]  Yesterday, I just looked at this article, started reading it, and I thought, man, look, this is even worse.
[00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.810]  State agency might redefine work.
[00:15:59.971 --> 00:16:05.453]  That is, if you want Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, whatever, you've got to, quote, be working.
[00:16:05.893 --> 00:16:10.515]  If you want your workers' compensation, you've got to do this.
[00:16:11.455 --> 00:16:12.575]  And what's the new work?
[00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:13.796]  Would you like to know?
[00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:15.536]  I told you they're going to blow out the economy.
[00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:17.277]  I read federal plans eight years ago on this.
[00:16:18.348 --> 00:16:24.172]  Blow out the economy, make you all get, quote, supplements for your health care, once they socialize health care.
[00:16:24.552 --> 00:16:33.458]  Make you get a supplement to your paycheck, quote, for your volunteerism, where you're made to volunteer in the new national compulsory volunteerism, which is an oxymoron.
[00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.200]  And I read the article with horror.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.683]  Workforce commission proposal would tie Medicaid benefits to personal behavior.
[00:16:40.743 --> 00:16:43.785]  Now, about a month ago, I'd heard this on the radio locally, and I'd forgotten about it.
[00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:47.628]  There's hundreds of things I see in here, and I never end up reporting here.
[00:16:48.522 --> 00:17:00.091]  The Texas Workforce Commission is attempting to redefine the word work in a way that would cut off Medicaid benefits to thousands of Texans who don't follow a list of state behavioral rules.
[00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:01.752]  It's about behavioral control.
[00:17:01.972 --> 00:17:05.415]  And then it goes on to say it'll be your workers' compensation, state compensation as well.
[00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:18.515]  Meanwhile, a non-profit group and a gaggle of Texas Democrats are pressuring officials in Austin and Washington to kill the proposal which is on the agency's agenda for Tuesday.
[00:17:21.336 --> 00:17:29.638]  The proposed rule would affect more than 350,000 adults who receive both Medicaid and cash assistance through temporary aid for needy families.
[00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:48.362]  The rules would expand the definition of work, and listen carefully, to include such things as maintaining children's immunizations, gotta take your shots, avoiding drug and alcohol abuse, that means drug testing, now you get welfare, you drug test, you're a criminal, and making sure children attend school.
[00:17:50.323 --> 00:17:54.106]  Adults who fail to live up to any of the items on the list would lose Medicaid coverage.
[00:17:54.146 --> 00:17:57.869]  Now, the state loss is 14 absences in a semester is a truancy.
[00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.771]  Under this,
[00:18:01.006 --> 00:18:09.512]  It means that one absentee, you sign a form waiving rights, you're on a furtive unification, you're on probation to get welfare, now you're at a higher standard.
[00:18:10.153 --> 00:18:16.938]  The conflict over the rule hinges on differing interpretations of one of the federal government's work-first welfare reform laws.
[00:18:17.278 --> 00:18:25.184]  Texas Republican leadership says federal law gives the state the right to tie Medicaid benefits to personal responsibility, agreements designed to help people
[00:18:26.212 --> 00:18:27.513]  Leave public assistance.
[00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:29.775]  Yeah, take your inoculations, do your drug testing.
[00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:31.136]  And it's the Republicans doing that.
[00:18:33.678 --> 00:18:36.340]  Now that sounds like something a Socialist Democrat would do, you see.
[00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:50.932]  And, uh, it goes, every element of that is designed to help the child to Representative Arlene Wolhamoff, Republican Burleson, who sponsored a new state law that sparked the proposed rule.
[00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.731]  Wow!
[00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:59.054]  Are we saying that we don't care if poor children are not immunized?
[00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:04.097]  So, that's the new America.
[00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:07.840]  And when you're under compulsory national draft, which
[00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:10.280]  Clark and others say it's going to be domestic.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.581]  You're going to dig ditches, pick up trash, do warrant service, run checkpoints.
[00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:15.321]  This is all admitted.
[00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:25.584]  This has been planned for now five years, since I saw federal documents in 98, when Clinton funded it under the National Highway Seat Belt Safety Initiative, which I talk about in Police State 2000.
[00:19:26.324 --> 00:19:26.984]  I lay this out.
[00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:29.545]  You're going to have to take inoculations.
[00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:30.745]  You're going to have to give drug tests.
[00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:32.986]  Because you're going to be like the military, see?
[00:19:33.226 --> 00:19:34.667]  They've got to take all the inoculations.
[00:19:34.927 --> 00:19:35.967]  They've got to do the drug tests.
[00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:41.217]  Then I think about Army News Watch that airs here on Cable Channel 17 on County Cable.
[00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:45.181]  A couple years ago they said, oh, doesn't matter if you've got two employees or a hundred.
[00:19:46.542 --> 00:19:48.444]  Call us, we'll drop by and drug test them.
[00:19:50.746 --> 00:19:52.348]  Now I know what's going on right here in Austin.
[00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:57.893]  Because this particular piece of Army News Watch was produced in San Antonio and Austin showing the drug testing.
[00:19:58.554 --> 00:20:00.135]  Oh, here's the member of the military.
[00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:01.657]  He's here to take your sample.
[00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.453]  And you work at a shopping mall.
[00:20:05.734 --> 00:20:07.917]  I mean, this is pure evil, folks!
[00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:08.637]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:14.425]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:19.423]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:20:19.823 --> 00:20:24.685]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:20:25.045 --> 00:20:26.846]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:27.907]  can barely be read.
[00:20:28.207 --> 00:20:29.167]  It has faded that much.
[00:20:29.527 --> 00:20:33.389]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:20:33.689 --> 00:20:42.052]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:20:42.312 --> 00:20:50.175]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[00:20:50.495 --> 00:20:54.416]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:56.697]  Constitution-proof silver dollar with your order.
[00:20:57.037 --> 00:21:02.282]  Call now toll-free 800-686-2237 and order the Documents of Freedom.
[00:21:02.582 --> 00:21:03.983]  Don't wait, do it today!
[00:21:04.344 --> 00:21:04.784]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:21:11.058 --> 00:21:15.541]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:20.004]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:20.284 --> 00:21:20.844]  We listened.
[00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:26.128]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:26.408 --> 00:21:26.888]  We listened.
[00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:30.311]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:31.291]  We listened.
[00:21:31.752 --> 00:21:33.873]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:42.239]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:44.020]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:51.768]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:21:52.148 --> 00:21:56.472]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[00:22:05.234 --> 00:22:12.199]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:18.764]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered and licensed by the government?
[00:22:19.064 --> 00:22:24.948]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[00:22:25.408 --> 00:22:29.151]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[00:22:29.853 --> 00:22:31.414]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[00:22:31.654 --> 00:22:32.514]  Well, there is a way.
[00:22:32.775 --> 00:22:38.878]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:49.503]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[00:22:49.563 --> 00:22:50.384]  Constitution.
[00:22:50.644 --> 00:22:52.285]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:54.846]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[00:22:55.306 --> 00:23:03.013]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:23:03.293 --> 00:23:07.737]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:12.135]  Hi, my name is Donald from TheGoldenAnswer.com.
[00:23:12.455 --> 00:23:14.616]  Everyone knows that they need to own gold and silver.
[00:23:14.836 --> 00:23:16.137]  You see the headlines every day.
[00:23:16.397 --> 00:23:18.819]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[00:23:19.139 --> 00:23:21.661]  Many of you want to acquire gold, but you can't afford it.
[00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:27.005]  TheGoldenAnswer.com is a private club and our members acquire gold at 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:29.146]  That's right, just 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:33.090]  Our layaway leverage plan will help you stockpile real wealth.
[00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.612]  Now obviously there's a catch, but we believe in you.
[00:23:35.812 --> 00:23:37.674]  We believe in your desire to be secure.

[00:23:45.782 --> 00:23:50.066]  The balance is paid off by getting five other people into the club and to open a contract.
[00:23:50.326 --> 00:23:51.447]  We are the answer.
[00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:56.552]  The Golden Answer to securing your future in gold and silver bullion at 40 cents on the dollar.

[00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:00.917]  That's 1-800-710-1090.
[00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:36.726]  You see, under the Department of Education, Department of Labor, and Statistics, under the Department of Transportation, under the Defense Department, they've all been woven into basically the symbol of fascism, a bundle of sticks.
[00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:38.867]  Each agency being one of the sticks.
[00:24:40.803 --> 00:25:02.980]  Under the control of FEMA and the North American Military Command, and now the shadow government is going public, and they're saying for continuity of government, for national security, infrastructure, protection, all your jobs, in every facet of the economy, from childcare, to transportation, to agriculture,
[00:25:03.689 --> 00:25:32.008]  to retail is going to be overseen by the government by federal officers and the Homeland Security has said they look to the Pentagon, Regular Army, National Guard, MPs from all the services and the new Secure Corps slash AmeriCorps, TIPS, FEMA, Neighborhood Watch, all of these are under that control and so well now it's part of national security you have to give your urine to the military
[00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:35.632]  You have to give your other tissue sample to them.
[00:25:35.692 --> 00:25:38.252]  You have to come under their control.
[00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:40.473]  They're saying it!
[00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:41.913]  They're doing it!
[00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:43.873]  They're starting the programs.
[00:25:43.913 --> 00:25:44.814]  But here's the good news.
[00:25:45.654 --> 00:26:00.817]  Before 9-11, I saw news reports, listeners mailed them to me out of Illinois and Tennessee and Florida, where the National Guard would drop by at the schools
[00:26:02.924 --> 00:26:04.906]  And they would give inoculations of the children.
[00:26:05.246 --> 00:26:14.734]  They would have a list of children who hadn't been inoculated, and they would show up and they would give the children shots without a form, without anything.
[00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:21.000]  In fact, last year it created massive outrage in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:29.667]  And the Arizona Republic reported, this is a picture of a little black girl crying as a soldier injected her in the shoulder with a tetanus shot.
[00:26:32.111 --> 00:26:45.522]  Now, in that case, the school had, quote, gotten permission from parents, had them sign forms for children that were off the immunization rolls, and didn't tell them troops were going to come do it, but it was a training op for the troops to acclimate them to this, training op for the children and the teachers.
[00:26:46.491 --> 00:26:48.994]  But in years past, they would have it where they wouldn't even ask.
[00:26:49.054 --> 00:26:50.275]  And of course, lawsuits were filed.
[00:26:50.315 --> 00:26:52.638]  But the point is, they've been trying to implement this.
[00:26:52.818 --> 00:26:54.500]  Trying to do this for the children.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.281]  They try it always with a captive audience.
[00:26:56.301 --> 00:27:07.113]  The military, old school children, federal employees, people that are in guilds like firefighters or police that are in brotherhoods where the organizations can just say, you better do it or you lose your job.
[00:27:07.153 --> 00:27:08.034]  It's all color of law.
[00:27:09.639 --> 00:27:11.581]  But the good news is people said no.
[00:27:11.621 --> 00:27:16.324]  They said we're going to give all police, all military, all firefighters, all medical workers.
[00:27:17.165 --> 00:27:19.167]  We had dozens of police chiefs and sheriffs on.
[00:27:19.187 --> 00:27:20.107]  We read all the news articles.
[00:27:20.127 --> 00:27:22.229]  It was the Model State Cell Emergency Powers Act.
[00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:23.070]  They couldn't pass it.
[00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.833]  So last year in 2000 they passed it on page 76 of Homeland Security.
[00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:28.134]  Now over a year ago.
[00:27:28.154 --> 00:27:29.895]  And they said you've got to take it.
[00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:34.139]  If you're a professional in the government or in government type work.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.061]  99 plus percent said no.
[00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:42.288]  296 out of 10 million people that were ordered to take it took it according to the L.A.
[00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:42.669]  Times.
[00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:46.550]  20,000 were ordered to take it according to the Associated Press in Connecticut.
[00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.091]  Four showed up to take it.
[00:27:48.731 --> 00:27:49.031]  Okay?
[00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:50.972]  I mean, they're just refusing en masse.
[00:27:52.012 --> 00:27:53.253]  And they had said you had to take it.
[00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:56.474]  Then they tried to... First they said you have to take it.
[00:27:56.494 --> 00:27:57.975]  Then they offered to pay them like $1,000 to take it.
[00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:11.380]  Then, a couple months ago, there was articles where they were saying, okay, you don't have to take it now to sign up to be an administrator, to be someone who will administer this, who will give it.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.642]  Still, most of them said no.
[00:28:14.302 --> 00:28:20.167]  Here's USA Today, health and science section, smallpox vaccination plans ceased.
[00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:36.672]  Less than a year, no it's more than a year, after President Bush announced a smallpox vaccination plan to protect America in the event of a terrorist attack, a fraction of the expected number of health workers have been immunized and the much valued program is dead in the water.
[00:28:37.673 --> 00:28:38.953]  Now at first they said you gotta take it.
[00:28:39.273 --> 00:28:48.958]  We'd have police chiefs on and they'd go, well we were just told there's no law but we won't get our insurance rating and we can't show up to work and the cops just said no en masse.
[00:28:50.054 --> 00:28:51.235]  They just said, no, we're not doing it.
[00:28:51.275 --> 00:28:53.657]  I mean, are you conspiracy theorists?
[00:28:53.877 --> 00:28:57.340]  Why, police officer, did you suddenly get it?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.522]  I guess 99% of you are crazy, like me now.
[00:29:01.423 --> 00:29:02.143]  Join us.
[00:29:02.604 --> 00:29:03.985]  Come all the way with us.
[00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:06.106]  Protect yourself and your family.
[00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:07.407]  And the Republic.
[00:29:07.807 --> 00:29:09.289]  Good job.
[00:29:09.969 --> 00:29:13.232]  Self-preservation finally got you to dig deep in that brain.
[00:29:13.472 --> 00:29:15.093]  You weren't stupid after all.
[00:29:16.983 --> 00:29:22.328]  Federal health officials say they're not ready to declare the program dead, but they readily acknowledge it's ailing.
[00:29:22.688 --> 00:29:30.836]  The fact is it's ceased, says Ray Stakes of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not that anyone's issued an edict to say stop.
[00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:31.997]  Yeah, just no one will take it.
[00:29:32.017 --> 00:29:34.279]  I'll read a little bit more of this.
[00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:35.079]  We'll take calls.
[00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:36.681]  We'll talk about the Patriot Act and Deep Trouble.
[00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:36.761]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:43.466 --> 00:29:44.086]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:44.627 --> 00:29:52.390]  Of course, the troops had to take it, and I have mainstream news admitting it's killing and maiming them.
[00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.212]  Turns out it's got some bizarre virus that causes an autoimmune response.
[00:29:56.852 --> 00:29:58.333]  It just accidentally got added to it.
[00:29:58.373 --> 00:29:59.173]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.554 --> 00:30:01.454]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.954 --> 00:30:03.555]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.476 --> 00:30:07.177]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.205 --> 00:30:11.185]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:13.747]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:30:13.847 --> 00:30:14.547]  You heard that right.
[00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:17.108]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:30:17.268 --> 00:30:18.208]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.729]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:21.550]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.571]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:28.453]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.

[00:32:06.252 --> 00:32:06.472]  P.O.
[00:32:06.512 --> 00:32:08.493]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.795]  Oh my God!
[00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:15.777]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:32:16.058 --> 00:32:16.738]  Yes, it's true.
[00:32:16.818 --> 00:32:19.520]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.

[00:32:37.469 --> 00:32:38.690]  This is a limited time offer.
[00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:43.152]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[00:32:43.313 --> 00:32:45.133]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.

[00:32:58.878 --> 00:33:02.099]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:30.117 --> 00:33:30.718]  Welcome back.
[00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:37.863]  We're now 33 minutes and 25 seconds into the first hour of this Thursday Transmission Against Tyranny.
[00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:53.595]  I know a lot of stations join us after 30 minutes of the show is already in progress for some reason, which is fine, but then I feel I need to recap and I guess crystallize and encapsulize a key point here.
[00:33:55.416 --> 00:33:56.257]  USA Today.
[00:33:56.637 --> 00:33:58.918]  Smallpox vaccination plan ceased.
[00:33:59.618 --> 00:34:00.719]  The plan is dead.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.563]  Now, I haven't done the math, but what is 296 out of 10 million, according to the LA Times?
[00:34:10.324 --> 00:34:13.526]  That's how many people had taken it when the program was really dead six months ago.
[00:34:13.646 --> 00:34:16.327]  They started it 14 months ago.
[00:34:17.628 --> 00:34:23.851]  They tried to pass state laws saying you had to take it if you were a medical worker, police officer, a firefighter.
[00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.451]  And, I mean, I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:29.273]  What is 296 out of 10 million?
[00:34:29.293 --> 00:34:30.934]  I mean, that's ridiculous!
[00:34:31.534 --> 00:34:32.195]  That's wonderful!
[00:34:32.575 --> 00:34:35.917]  But, I mean, those numbers are just... I didn't expect that many people to refuse it.
[00:34:37.358 --> 00:34:42.241]  This special brew cooked up by your loving friends in the bioweapons labs.
[00:34:43.662 --> 00:34:53.549]  And now the troops have been taking it, and I see articles every day, and I've only read a few of them in the last few months, where the troops are taking the stuff, dropping dead, shriveling up, vomiting everywhere, falling apart,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.962]  They admit the anthrax shots did this.
[00:34:57.002 --> 00:34:58.403]  I mean, I've got medical examiners.
[00:34:59.184 --> 00:35:00.745]  I've got epidemiologists.
[00:35:00.805 --> 00:35:02.166]  I mean, we've had them all on the show.
[00:35:02.207 --> 00:35:04.048]  We've read all the mainstream articles about it.
[00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.814]  We've caught the government administering bioweapons tests on the troops over the last 50 years through vaccines.
[00:35:10.894 --> 00:35:12.135]  I mean, the word is out.
[00:35:15.004 --> 00:35:23.707]  So, what is the government going to do if they can't set a precedent to have martial law under the guise of protecting us from a bio-attack and forcibly injecting us?
[00:35:24.147 --> 00:35:26.968]  What are they going to do if they can't get their enforcers to do it?
[00:35:29.729 --> 00:35:33.410]  What are they going to do if they can't get their minions to carry out their orders?
[00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.951]  Well, the Houston Chronicle told us a few months ago.
[00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:41.092]  They got two bills introduced that look like they can pass.
[00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.313]  Especially if there's any type of terror attack.
[00:35:44.249 --> 00:35:47.692]  For National Compulsory Draft 18-49.
[00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.173]  And here's the news.
[00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.856]  Most of you won't be sent overseas.
[00:35:51.876 --> 00:35:53.777]  They're saying about 20% of that number.
[00:35:53.797 --> 00:35:55.639]  Of course, I never believe anything they say.
[00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:56.620]  We don't know what they'll really do.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.243]  But they're saying 20% of that number will be sent overseas.
[00:36:01.324 --> 00:36:09.831]  And they list engineers, lawyers, doctors, police officers, professionals, firefighters, of every stripe, accountants,
[00:36:10.976 --> 00:36:17.502]  And yes, you'll then be under military rule, under admiralty, with absolutely no constitutional rights, and you're going to be injected.
[00:36:18.002 --> 00:36:19.343]  They say that's the first thing they'll do.
[00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:22.006]  They try to offer people money to take the shots.
[00:36:22.026 --> 00:36:25.949]  Then they try to say you don't have to take the shots, just sign on to say that you'll administer it.
[00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:32.677]  They had articles, again, from Idaho to Iowa.
[00:36:32.778 --> 00:36:44.281]  I saw news stories, literally, from in Iowa, in Idaho, in New York, where they were going to have the schools, and they were going to put up fences, and have security, and bus people in.
[00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:46.321]  It talked about forcibly injecting people.
[00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:55.402]  The head of the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, the guy that wrote the law for the Feds, in the Detroit Free Press.
[00:36:55.442 --> 00:36:57.244]  This is in The Road to Tyranny.
[00:36:58.104 --> 00:37:00.826]  This is from 20 months ago, when I made the film and I released it.
[00:37:01.287 --> 00:37:05.110]  Saying, quote, we'll shoot your grandmother if she refuses quarantine and injection.
[00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.731]  That's in the film.
[00:37:08.612 --> 00:37:09.333]  But it didn't work.
[00:37:09.453 --> 00:37:10.234]  People said no.
[00:37:10.334 --> 00:37:11.534]  They didn't go along with it.
[00:37:12.835 --> 00:37:14.797]  So now they've got a national draft for you.
[00:37:16.018 --> 00:37:17.399]  Now they're going to try to force you into it.
[00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:18.620]  That's not going to work either.
[00:37:20.373 --> 00:37:23.274]  Across the board, people know the truth.
[00:37:23.494 --> 00:37:30.516]  Eighty-seven to eighty-nine percent, depending on which poll, know the borders are wide open and illegal aliens are bad for the economy and bad for America.
[00:37:33.036 --> 00:37:35.777]  Eighty-plus percent of Americans are against NAFTA and GATT.
[00:37:35.817 --> 00:37:43.319]  It was almost the opposite of those numbers back in ninety-four when they had everybody on Larry King Live, the Republicans and the Democrats, telling us how wonderful it would be.
[00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:46.259]  I keep saying ninety-four.
[00:37:46.299 --> 00:37:48.640]  That was ninety-three when they had Al Gore and the rest of them up there.
[00:37:50.243 --> 00:37:52.144]  And Ross Perot was saying it was bad.
[00:37:53.384 --> 00:37:54.765]  This is all going on.
[00:37:55.345 --> 00:37:56.585]  This is all happening.
[00:37:58.686 --> 00:38:04.328]  And so, people don't have all the specifics, but they know they can't trust this illegitimate government.
[00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:06.009]  That's the good news.
[00:38:06.049 --> 00:38:07.670]  So, here's some of the news here.
[00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.191]  Smallpox vaccination plan ceases.
[00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:10.631]  It's over.
[00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:11.051]  It's done.
[00:38:11.231 --> 00:38:11.731]  USA Today.
[00:38:13.092 --> 00:38:16.373]  Matrix system would put privacy on endangered list.
[00:38:17.344 --> 00:38:19.425]  That's out of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[00:38:19.445 --> 00:38:20.585]  It's called the Matrix System.
[00:38:20.626 --> 00:38:26.068]  It's Total Information Awareness Network is now morphed into what they call the Matrix and turns out it's four years old.
[00:38:26.108 --> 00:38:27.909]  Yeah, this has all been set up years ago.
[00:38:29.049 --> 00:38:30.270]  Uh, Washington Times.
[00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.512]  Senators join forces to roll back parts of Patriot Act.
[00:38:34.632 --> 00:38:35.532]  Okay, see?
[00:38:35.932 --> 00:38:36.653]  See what's happening?
[00:38:36.793 --> 00:38:37.713]  We're winning the fight.
[00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:46.217]  Now that doesn't mean that they're not gonna light a building like you light a black cat firecracker on the 4th of July.
[00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:50.532]  Don't think they won't light some buildings up like candles, like Roman candles.
[00:38:50.892 --> 00:38:52.793]  Don't think they won't release smallpox.
[00:38:53.854 --> 00:39:04.842]  They had their CFR scare master, Gary Hart, a few months ago, I guess about six months ago, on the O'Reilly Factor.
[00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:09.285]  They had him on other shows like Hannity and Combs.
[00:39:09.585 --> 00:39:10.906]  Lister sent me video of it.
[00:39:10.946 --> 00:39:11.346]  Thank you!
[00:39:11.386 --> 00:39:12.047]  I have the video.
[00:39:13.348 --> 00:39:14.849]  We posted the transcript here.
[00:39:15.726 --> 00:39:25.468]  Uh, where they said, Hart says Denver, Dallas, Cleveland will be hit by smallpox in the next year and you will all take your injections.
[00:39:25.528 --> 00:39:27.949]  That was when their program for forced injections was in trouble.
[00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:29.449]  They were trying to scaremonger.
[00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.570]  And so don't think that these guys are done.
[00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:41.992]  I mean, Gary Hart said a couple days after 9-11, he said, quote, we need to use this disaster for what President Bush's father called for, a new world order.
[00:39:44.773 --> 00:39:44.993]  So,
[00:39:46.738 --> 00:39:50.422]  Just because we're winning a few fights here, let's be honest with ourselves.
[00:39:50.482 --> 00:39:56.968]  We're in sudden death overtime, to use a football analogy, and this is not a game.
[00:39:56.988 --> 00:39:58.189]  This is not a joke, folks.
[00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.150]  We are on the edge.
[00:39:59.511 --> 00:40:00.491]  We are having victories.
[00:40:00.511 --> 00:40:01.472]  We are derailing them.
[00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:02.614]  They're not stopping.
[00:40:03.514 --> 00:40:05.076]  They are careening over the cliff.
[00:40:05.798 --> 00:40:10.641]  Let's talk to the callers, the toll-free number to talk to us on air, to get involved with your questions, comments.
[00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:19.346]  If you disagree with me, you agree, you got a news item you want to mention, something you want to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:19.727]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:19.747 --> 00:40:23.389]  And I don't mind long-time callers calling.
[00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:24.910]  We have a lot of first-time callers, too.
[00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:25.930]  It's hard for them to get through.
[00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:28.472]  It'd be kind of nice if first-time callers called in.
[00:40:29.312 --> 00:40:33.554]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to find out if you had got the email on the editorial about Clarence Bremer.
[00:40:59.103 --> 00:40:59.603]  I told you about it.
[00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.404]  Yeah, why don't you fill folks in on that story?
[00:41:03.225 --> 00:41:04.046]  Did you get the email?
[00:41:04.066 --> 00:41:04.466]  Yes, I did.
[00:41:04.746 --> 00:41:05.967]  Okay, cool.
[00:41:06.687 --> 00:41:08.308]  Well, and then there's another part in there.
[00:41:08.408 --> 00:41:12.170]  I hate mentioning stuff and not telling folks what it is.
[00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:20.934]  Yeah, Clarence Bremer thinks that apparently, according to this, without the reporter even commenting on it, like, isn't that cool?
[00:41:21.354 --> 00:41:23.455]  Here's his quote, talking about juries.
[00:41:23.495 --> 00:41:27.417]  Of course, I work on telling them, juries, what to do and when to do it.
[00:41:28.146 --> 00:41:28.566]  He said.
[00:41:29.547 --> 00:41:30.948]  So tell them who Bremer is.
[00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:35.071]  10th Circuit Court of Appeals up here.
[00:41:36.292 --> 00:41:39.594]  And for folks that don't know what we're talking about, you gotta remember a lot of people are new listeners.
[00:41:39.614 --> 00:41:43.437]  They have no idea what the Fourth Amendment is, much less what juries are supposed to do.
[00:41:43.817 --> 00:41:49.141]  So let's go over jury nullification briefly and what grand juries are supposed to do.
[00:41:50.062 --> 00:41:52.404]  Folks, you can go read news stories.
[00:41:52.604 --> 00:41:54.225]  I suggest you do it on the microfiche.
[00:41:55.382 --> 00:42:14.209]  Just pull up court case murder case 1879 and you know hundreds of dozens of articles will pop up about famous murder cases and you can read where the jury's ordering the judge around the jury saying what what the jury will say we want to talk to that that witness again the jury will
[00:42:15.527 --> 00:42:19.788]  Uh, ask questions themselves of the, uh, of the witnesses.
[00:42:20.468 --> 00:42:25.049]  Uh, the judge basically, uh, referee, was a referee.
[00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:26.889]  And the jury was the power.
[00:42:26.929 --> 00:42:28.089]  The jury was the people.
[00:42:28.149 --> 00:42:29.730]  It's a form of voting, folks.
[00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:34.211]  Jury box, grand jury box, ballot box, cartridge box, soap box.
[00:42:34.231 --> 00:42:35.851]  They're all boxes for some reason.
[00:42:36.391 --> 00:42:40.652]  The ways we get involved and empower our lives and take control of our lives in the Republic.
[00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:41.952]  Uh, now,
[00:42:42.737 --> 00:42:51.747]  Today, grand juries are told what to do by the prosecutor and the judge, and are instructed by the county or city attorneys, and are total rubber stamps.
[00:42:51.767 --> 00:42:52.468]  They're just told this.
[00:42:52.488 --> 00:42:54.710]  They're given little criminal handbooks on how to behave.
[00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.491]  It's criminal.
[00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:03.611]  Juries are told what to do, instructed, well, this person's guilty, you heard the evidence, doesn't matter what you think, you go vote for guilty now.
[00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:08.992]  And in many cases, in civil cases, like the Waco case, they're not even allowing juries now.
[00:43:09.312 --> 00:43:18.694]  Hey Alex, that reminds me, earlier in that same editorial, he says, Clarence Brimmer is quoted as saying that juries, their job is to decide who's lying.
[00:43:19.116 --> 00:43:21.457]  In other words, their only job is to decide the facts.
[00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:27.019]  Was this black person riding in the front of the bus in direct contradiction to, you know, law?
[00:43:27.419 --> 00:43:28.000]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:37.903]  And the Founding Fathers across the board agreed, one of the few things they agreed on was the Second Amendment, and on this issue, that the jury judges the facts as well as the law.
[00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:44.791]  Well, let's take a time to kill, which is basically based on a true story, things that have happened.
[00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:49.995]  The Klan grabs a little black girl, brutally rapes her, almost kills her, the daddy walks in, machine guns him.
[00:43:50.275 --> 00:43:51.236]  The jury lets him go!
[00:43:51.557 --> 00:43:52.597]  They deserve to die!
[00:43:53.018 --> 00:43:54.939]  That's what America's all about, folks.
[00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:55.740]  Right.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.944]  And so, get it through your heads, people, that judge, if he tells you what to do, is a criminal!
[00:44:01.264 --> 00:44:02.625]  Who deserves to be arrested!
[00:44:02.866 --> 00:44:04.287]  Well, they take their oath to the judge.
[00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:05.718]  You knew that, didn't you?
[00:44:05.738 --> 00:44:06.819]  Yeah, it's getting sicker.
[00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:12.581]  Look, the bar just said we're getting rid of attorney-client privilege, and next year they're going to vote on getting rid of juries.
[00:44:14.401 --> 00:44:16.682]  I've got AP articles, folks!
[00:44:17.762 --> 00:44:22.064]  They make juries look stupid when it's, you know, garbage in, garbage out.
[00:44:22.104 --> 00:44:30.847]  If they get false information to begin with, they can't be... Well, everybody's trained now off these judge shows that have been on for 50 years, where it's a judge screaming at people.
[00:44:32.032 --> 00:44:34.574]  And saying, answer my question or I'll have you in contempt.
[00:44:35.295 --> 00:44:41.720]  Folks, 80 years ago, if a judge said, answer my question or I'll hold you in contempt, they would be kicked off the bench within a week.
[00:44:42.461 --> 00:44:43.422]  You understand, folks?
[00:44:43.462 --> 00:44:44.443]  That's illegal.
[00:44:44.523 --> 00:44:45.283]  That's criminal.
[00:44:45.504 --> 00:44:46.625]  You have a Fifth Amendment.
[00:44:46.825 --> 00:44:49.467]  You don't have to answer anything that thug tells you to answer.
[00:44:51.008 --> 00:44:52.750]  Yep, the jury is the judge.
[00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:53.330]  That's it.
[00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.971]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:54.011 --> 00:44:54.251]  You bet.
[00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:54.831]  Rob.
[00:44:55.332 --> 00:44:56.453]  Bob in Canada.
[00:44:56.473 --> 00:44:56.913]  Go ahead.
[00:44:59.135 --> 00:45:00.056]  Hello, Bob.
[00:45:00.836 --> 00:45:01.636]  Hello, Alex.
[00:45:02.016 --> 00:45:02.436]  Welcome!
[00:45:02.897 --> 00:45:21.922]  I find an inconsistency where I read stories where old people are brutally home invaded, mouth and eyes, you know, sealed over and then they're beaten with metal rods.
[00:45:22.042 --> 00:45:28.164]  Yeah, well... And they get away literally scot-free if you consider four months in jail.
[00:45:29.196 --> 00:45:40.640]  I consider that scot-free, and this is the legal system's getting so lenient now, I wonder with the dictatorial attitude of judges, is this going to change?
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:50.443]  Like, how does the New World Order justice develop from what appears to be total leniency to criminals?
[00:45:50.984 --> 00:45:57.886]  I can't pull up the numbers because I don't have them in front of me, but I've read dozens of articles the last few months, on and off air, I've seen these articles.
[00:45:59.157 --> 00:46:12.667]  A lot of groups are pointing this out, that if you're a non-violent drug offender, you know, some little 17-year-old kid with a bag of marijuana, you'll get a year in prison as a worker, you'll get eight years of probation.
[00:46:13.987 --> 00:46:24.134]  The average in the US, and some states have higher penalties and that's good, but the average prison time for manslaughter is four and a half years.
[00:46:24.535 --> 00:46:27.917]  The average time for aggravated murder
[00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:30.291]  Okay, is 10 years.
[00:46:30.311 --> 00:46:34.856]  Now the only time you really get executed now is if you kill a cop.
[00:46:35.797 --> 00:46:38.540]  And, you know, I say kill them if they kill anybody.
[00:46:39.478 --> 00:46:41.939]  Uh, and then again, you got to do, is the death penalty good?
[00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:46.520]  Well, you can't trust this criminal government to hand out a death penalty, so now I'm against it if there's any federal involvement.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.940]  I'm against a federal death penalty.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.582]  I'm for state death penalties, but people better be very focused on this very serious issue.
[00:46:53.622 --> 00:46:56.703]  A criminal government can't be trusted to hand out death sentences, is my point.
[00:46:57.263 --> 00:46:58.263]  But where is it going?
[00:46:58.303 --> 00:46:59.203]  It's a Pandora's box.
[00:46:59.223 --> 00:47:02.464]  They bring in masses of illegals from third world countries with higher crime rates.
[00:47:02.484 --> 00:47:05.005]  This is England, as an example, or Canada or the U.S.
[00:47:06.028 --> 00:47:10.151]  Uh, they take the guns from the people, the crime rate explodes, they selectively enforce against the criminals.
[00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:22.761]  I mean, you know, it's like the gypsy, he'd broken into the farmer's house three times, uh, Tony Martin's house, he finally shoots and kills one of them, and he gets locked in prison, and the gypsies go scot-free and write a book and get a bunch of money and sue him.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.321]  So, uh, that's how this works.
[00:47:26.421 --> 00:47:28.942]  And then you see the people call for more police.
[00:47:29.002 --> 00:47:40.588]  It's like that article I won in Telegraph, where in Nottinghamshire, a rural area, they have a murder every week, the criminals are everywhere, everyone's been disarmed, the police admit it, and their answer is more police, more cameras.
[00:47:43.263 --> 00:47:43.783]  You understand?
[00:47:43.843 --> 00:47:45.685]  So, again, problem, reaction, solution.
[00:47:45.705 --> 00:47:47.566]  They keep rolling in and escalating it.
[00:47:48.026 --> 00:47:51.808]  They create the climate for crime that gets more citizens, more cops killed.
[00:47:52.249 --> 00:47:53.529]  That increases the prisons.
[00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:57.932]  They put non-violence in the prisons and release the violence to create the crisis.
[00:47:57.952 --> 00:47:58.512]  Do you understand?
[00:47:59.313 --> 00:48:01.614]  Yes, and I see it.
[00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:07.478]  Up here we have a very apathetic, docile population that just seems to think it's fine.
[00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:12.121]  And I see, you know, like I say, people being violently
[00:48:12.938 --> 00:48:16.681]  Victimized, and the perpetrators, it's literally nothing.
[00:48:16.941 --> 00:48:20.424]  Somebody comes in, and I saw that story where they let the guy off after a few months.
[00:48:20.444 --> 00:48:25.929]  He tied down the old people, beat them with rods, robbed them, threatened to kill them, and he gets four months.
[00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:33.034]  The guy should have gotten 20 years hard labor, and I don't mean competing against our jobs, I mean busting rocks.
[00:48:33.175 --> 00:48:34.676]  Yes, I agree totally.
[00:48:35.536 --> 00:48:40.060]  And it's not happening, and when the Justice Minister was
[00:48:41.658 --> 00:48:43.919]  He emailed with 8,000 signatures.
[00:48:43.979 --> 00:48:48.042]  He emailed back saying, well, I don't care what you want.
[00:48:48.282 --> 00:48:50.203]  If anything, it's going to get more lenient.
[00:48:50.783 --> 00:48:55.426]  So I guess my question is, the new world order... Well, I've got to stop you.
[00:48:55.466 --> 00:49:00.528]  I see people getting, what, four or five years in prison down there if they're caught with an unregistered gun.
[00:49:00.849 --> 00:49:01.669]  That's been in your news.
[00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:08.273]  So you get four or five years for having an unregistered gun, no criminal record, but somebody who brutalizes old people gets four months.
[00:49:08.293 --> 00:49:08.973]  Isn't that sick?
[00:49:09.453 --> 00:49:10.494]  It's very perverted.
[00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:22.326]  And, um, I just am trying to figure out, you know, for the New World Order to get entrenched, what will it do with these things, or will it just keep the perversion happening?
[00:49:22.346 --> 00:49:27.472]  Sir, the Washington Times already reported, our military, it doesn't just want illegal aliens to join the military.
[00:49:27.512 --> 00:49:28.413]  This is the Washington Times.
[00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:31.796]  No matter how crazy it sounds, read the article like ten times on air.
[00:49:31.836 --> 00:49:32.517]  It was so incredible.
[00:49:33.539 --> 00:49:36.281]  They don't just, you know, they won't take you if you're just an illegal alien.
[00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:38.923]  They want, quote, aggravated felons.
[00:49:38.963 --> 00:49:41.986]  And it listed rape, child molestation, armed robbery.
[00:49:42.426 --> 00:49:43.967]  That's who's going to make up our army.
[00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:45.789]  Do you understand?
[00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.892]  Well, that's, that's beyond shocking.
[00:49:49.972 --> 00:49:51.413]  And what are they trying to prove?
[00:49:51.453 --> 00:49:54.475]  They just want to terrorize the innocent populace?
[00:49:54.735 --> 00:49:57.317]  Well, I mean, who made up the brown shirts bringing Hitler to power?
[00:49:57.358 --> 00:49:57.718]  Criminals.
[00:49:58.792 --> 00:50:00.193]  Criminals are ruthless.
[00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:01.113]  They'll follow orders.
[00:50:01.153 --> 00:50:01.794]  They understand it.
[00:50:01.814 --> 00:50:02.394]  They enjoy it.
[00:50:02.674 --> 00:50:05.456]  You think a normal person can go out and brutalize innocent people?
[00:50:05.676 --> 00:50:07.637]  You think a normal person can SWAT team old people?
[00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:14.161]  You think a normal person can pull an old woman's goods out on the side of the road and make her put them back in the vehicle?
[00:50:14.601 --> 00:50:16.883]  Only a sociopathic criminal can do that.
[00:50:17.543 --> 00:50:18.183]  They like it.
[00:50:18.644 --> 00:50:19.144]  They like it.
[00:50:19.284 --> 00:50:22.526]  I feel guilty if I'm rude to a friend or rude to my wife.
[00:50:23.366 --> 00:50:26.148]  But these people don't feel guilty about killing people.
[00:50:28.464 --> 00:50:29.505]  So where does it go?
[00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:37.391]  Is the idea just to laugh at the innocent people getting abused and to bring more controls?
[00:50:37.411 --> 00:50:38.451]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:50:39.152 --> 00:50:44.316]  Because the innocent people, as they're being attacked by the violent criminals, aren't going to understand it, aren't going to be sophisticated enough.
[00:50:44.336 --> 00:50:49.700]  They're going to go, more cops, more cops, more cops, more, more, more!
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.764]  How long is it going to take for this New World Order to get fully entrenched?
[00:50:54.824 --> 00:50:55.264]  Are they behind it?
[00:50:55.284 --> 00:50:55.824]  We're already in it.
[00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:57.806]  We're already in the New World Order, sir.
[00:50:58.954 --> 00:51:00.137]  It's just going to get worse and worse.
[00:51:01.038 --> 00:51:03.383]  Until people grow up and wake up and get involved.
[00:51:03.924 --> 00:51:05.347]  Until they shift paradigms.
[00:51:05.988 --> 00:51:09.035]  Until they energize their psychological warfare systems.
[00:51:10.413 --> 00:51:12.394]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:51:12.474 --> 00:51:23.179]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:51:23.559 --> 00:51:28.081]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:51:28.141 --> 00:51:39.487]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:51:40.087 --> 00:51:46.937]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:51:47.338 --> 00:51:49.461]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:51:49.962 --> 00:51:54.929]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:53:10.575 --> 00:53:14.902]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:15.082 --> 00:53:19.509]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:19.669 --> 00:53:24.056]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:53:24.096 --> 00:53:25.398]  The New World Order.
[00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:31.433]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:53:31.493 --> 00:53:38.418]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:53:38.558 --> 00:53:40.600]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:51.248]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:51.568 --> 00:53:53.670]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.091]  Alright ladies and gentlemen,
[00:54:23.672 --> 00:54:30.353]  We've got Mark Pickup with Human Life Matters is my guest coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[00:54:30.493 --> 00:54:36.234]  I'm going to have him on a couple of segments talking about Mary Schiavo Schindler who had her feeding tube pulled yesterday.
[00:54:36.274 --> 00:54:37.334]  She's conscious, awake.
[00:54:37.775 --> 00:54:38.435]  They're killing her.
[00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:43.116]  We'll get into that and then I do want to get into the situation with Israel and Syria.
[00:54:43.176 --> 00:54:45.596]  Now our troops and border battles there.
[00:54:46.256 --> 00:54:47.216]  A machine gun fight.
[00:54:47.316 --> 00:54:47.476]  U.S.
[00:54:47.516 --> 00:54:50.957]  troops battle at Iraqi-Syrian border.
[00:54:51.969 --> 00:55:00.356]  More on the Patriot Act in trouble, a bunch of news about torture at Guantanamo and the media trying to lie about it, when the general who was over it quit refusing to do it.
[00:55:00.636 --> 00:55:02.197]  That never gets mentioned in these debates.
[00:55:02.317 --> 00:55:02.958]  Is it happening?
[00:55:04.078 --> 00:55:04.799]  That's all coming up.
[00:55:04.819 --> 00:55:16.248]  Before I go back to Mike and Dave and Bill and Ron and others, I do want to encourage each and every one of you to get involved in the fight against the global tyranny that we call the New World Order.
[00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:22.448]  And in that fight, I found no better tool than my nine documentary, full-length feature films.
[00:55:23.348 --> 00:55:32.090]  Shocking exposés that show you what the government really is, how it's a foreign power, how it's run by enemy combatants, sworn to destroy the Republic and enslave you and your family.
[00:55:33.611 --> 00:55:40.272]  And if you want to stop our journey to tyranny, you need to get these videos, you need to make copies of them, you need to get them out to your friends, your family,
[00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:43.882]  Your county commissioners, your talk show hosts, and your area.
[00:55:43.902 --> 00:55:49.163]  9-1-1, the Road to Tyranny, is excellent, covering government-sponsored terror in September 11th, Oklahoma City, and the Globalist Master Plan.
[00:55:49.604 --> 00:55:52.424]  There's the Masters of Terror, it's part two of that, excellent as well.
[00:55:52.805 --> 00:55:54.825]  Police State, Three Total Enslavement, is my newest.
[00:55:55.245 --> 00:55:56.806]  Gets into what the New World Order is.
[00:55:57.646 --> 00:56:04.208]  Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, the firing troops, the concentration camps, forced inoculations, government-run white slavery rings, gun control.
[00:56:05.448 --> 00:56:08.669]  I've published a book, Order Out of Chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.550]  It's excellent.
[00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:10.730]  Newest thing we have to offer.
[00:56:11.625 --> 00:56:13.147]  I printed my own book.
[00:56:13.187 --> 00:56:13.868]  I did my own book.
[00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:15.390]  Descent into Tyranny.
[00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:16.311]  It's excellent as well.

[00:57:27.102 --> 00:57:30.363]  Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:30.423 --> 00:57:31.143]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:57:31.163 --> 00:57:34.164]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:34.804]  You're on the air.
[00:57:34.824 --> 00:57:35.725]  How you doing?
[00:57:35.865 --> 00:57:36.125]  Good.
[00:57:37.125 --> 00:57:40.026]  We have a mayor election coming up in November.
[00:57:40.587 --> 00:57:44.368]  I don't think the globalists are... I think they're going to try to fix this one out here.
[00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:46.760]  We have a Republican running.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:52.605]  He's not hanging out with Bush or nothing, but I think he's going to bring the Feds in as soon as he gets in.
[00:57:53.565 --> 00:57:55.046]  What do you know about Sam Katz?
[00:57:56.047 --> 00:57:58.949]  That's already happening regardless of whether it's Republicans or Democrats.
[00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.631]  This is bipartisan tyranny.
[00:58:00.991 --> 00:58:02.132]  Oh, there's no doubt, yeah.
[00:58:02.492 --> 00:58:07.976]  All our mayors have been gun grabbers since I don't know when, but yeah, a lot's going on here.
[00:58:07.996 --> 00:58:09.838]  What mayor are you talking about specifically?
[00:58:10.018 --> 00:58:10.819]  In Philadelphia.
[00:58:11.179 --> 00:58:14.361]  Oh, that's why they're bugging them, and oh yeah, that's all... Oh yeah.
[00:58:15.905 --> 00:58:24.410]  The incumbent isn't nothing to write home about, and he is a gun grabber, but I mean, I think this new guy's planning to bring in John Ashcroft and the crew.
[00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.291]  At least we kicked Patriot Act out with this guy.
[00:58:27.391 --> 00:58:35.276]  Well, that's why they hate him, that's why they're bugging him, and they've got, uh... Later they tried to claim the FBI was investigating Enron.
[00:58:35.376 --> 00:58:36.397]  Give me a break.
[00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:42.380]  So if this guy, if this guy, if this new guy catch wins, I'm thinking it's gonna be fixed.
[00:58:44.196 --> 00:58:45.757]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[00:58:46.377 --> 00:58:46.737]  Um, no.
[00:58:46.777 --> 00:58:50.198]  You're just doing a good job, and I'll talk to you another time after the election.
[00:58:50.399 --> 00:58:50.939]  Well, thank you.
[00:58:50.959 --> 00:58:52.619]  Thanks for mentioning that, uh, Mike.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:57.822]  Dave and Bill and, uh, Ron and others are up next, and, uh, the guest about, Terry Spievo.
[00:59:00.823 --> 00:59:09.446]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:11.267]  The BerkeyLite self-sterilizing
[00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:18.109]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:26.053 --> 00:59:26.713]  Big Brother.
[00:59:27.374 --> 00:59:28.394]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:29.135 --> 00:59:30.235]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.896 --> 00:59:31.696]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.476 --> 00:59:33.377]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.397 --> 00:59:37.719]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:42.282]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.011]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:47.052 --> 00:59:50.774]  It's already Thursday, the 16th of October, 2003.
[00:59:51.335 --> 00:59:52.536]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:53.396 --> 00:59:54.997]  Got a lot of calls to get to, a ton of news.
[00:59:55.017 --> 00:59:56.578]  We got a guest coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.881]  The Terri Schindler-Schiavo case.
[00:59:59.921 --> 01:00:02.423]  They pulled her feeding tube in Florida yesterday.
[01:00:02.463 --> 01:00:03.103]  She's conscious.
[01:00:03.123 --> 01:00:03.724]  She's awake.
[01:00:04.364 --> 01:00:05.985]  She cries when her mother comes in the room.
[01:00:06.005 --> 01:00:07.486]  The video of that's been released for months.
[01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:08.367]  There's new video out.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.941]  We'll talk about that for a couple of segments and take calls.
[01:00:11.981 --> 01:00:12.782]  And I'm getting into U.S.
[01:00:12.802 --> 01:00:15.084]  troops battle at Iraqi-Syria border.
[01:00:16.985 --> 01:00:19.947]  Also, Senators joined forces to roll back parts of Patriot Act.
[01:00:20.067 --> 01:00:25.371]  Smallpox vaccination plan ceased thanks to people being educated on the facts.
[01:00:26.652 --> 01:00:29.094]  Great success case here.
[01:00:29.134 --> 01:00:30.515]  This is from USA Today.
[01:00:31.055 --> 01:00:36.620]  I want to go over some of the atrocities our troops are admittedly committing under globalist control in Iraq.
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.361]  It's important that we cover the facts on that.
[01:00:39.031 --> 01:00:44.193]  So a lot more coming up in this second hour of the show.
[01:00:44.233 --> 01:00:47.074]  Don't forget the website, Infowars.com.
[01:00:47.694 --> 01:00:49.995]  Let's talk to Dave in Delaware.
[01:00:50.015 --> 01:00:51.676]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:00:51.696 --> 01:00:52.876]  Welcome.
[01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:53.596]  Good afternoon.
[01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:54.217]  Thank you.
[01:00:54.577 --> 01:00:54.957]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:55.197 --> 01:01:06.561]  Alex, I have a Delaware State newspaper in front of me right now that came out yesterday pertaining to the Pledge of Allegiance, and if I can read just a slight
[01:01:07.168 --> 01:01:07.608]  He's here.
[01:01:07.628 --> 01:01:08.909]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:24.073]  To start with, it says, they're giving you a fax number and a telephone number in case somebody wants to call in, but it's saying, I believe that the Constitution provision against the establishment of religion does not require a government devoid of religion.
[01:01:24.433 --> 01:01:32.396]  Title 14, section 4105 of the Dollar Code requires public schools to begin the day by reciting the pledge.
[01:01:32.916 --> 01:01:35.457]  The code includes the traditional
[01:01:36.139 --> 01:01:36.480]  I think so.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.282]  Let me see, has changed to wake up the U.S.
[01:02:02.323 --> 01:02:06.306]  Supreme Court decision and the schools cannot force students to recite the oath.
[01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:09.369]  Okay, so what are you getting at?
[01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:12.712]  I have a phone number here if anybody wanted to call it or fax it.
[01:02:13.933 --> 01:02:21.820]  What it is, it says, what are your views on removing the phrase, under God, from the Pledge of Allegiance?
[01:02:22.679 --> 01:02:24.560]  Well, yeah, there's a big move to do that.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.341]  I mean, a Kentucky court, a federal court in Kentucky two years ago ruled that the Declaration of Independence is unconstitutional.
[01:02:30.381 --> 01:02:42.705]  The amount of lunacy, again, about removing the foundation, just like the Ten Commandments were removing the foundation of what America is, is all very serious.
[01:02:42.785 --> 01:02:44.866]  But I would just get out of the public schools, period.
[01:02:46.398 --> 01:02:51.301]  I mean, still having the pledge or saying under God is window dressing on just an evil system.
[01:02:51.621 --> 01:02:56.243]  Well, just like your currency, it says, and God we trust, but what God are they speaking about?
[01:02:56.643 --> 01:03:01.526]  Well, also, see, I mean, it's all just, you know, they talk about the grand architect.
[01:03:01.606 --> 01:03:04.027]  Well, that's what they talk about in The Matrix Reloaded.
[01:03:04.327 --> 01:03:04.507]  Yeah.
[01:03:04.527 --> 01:03:08.409]  When they talk about the grand architect of the universe, folks, they're talking about Ol' Beelzebo.
[01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:12.911]  Now, would you want me to give this number out in case somebody wanted to fax anything?
[01:03:13.553 --> 01:03:14.773]  Backs it to who, the state?
[01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:17.094]  State of Delaware, State News.
[01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:20.435]  Sure, if you want to, go ahead.
[01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:26.376]  Okay, it's area code 302-741-8252.
[01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.957]  Okay, sir, thank you so much for the call.
[01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:36.839]  We're out of time now for this short segment, and I'll get to Bill and Ron and Donnie and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:40.347]  Well, we got a guest coming up about Terri Schiavo, so be patient.
[01:03:40.987 --> 01:03:42.348]  They pulled her feeding tube yesterday.
[01:03:42.388 --> 01:03:48.132]  Within 50 to 60 hours, they say there'll be irrevocable damage to her nervous system and body.
[01:03:49.673 --> 01:03:51.534]  She's had infections for 10 years.
[01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:56.517]  She's not allowed to be given treatment for infections or problems or to be given physical therapy.
[01:03:56.557 --> 01:03:59.980]  She was talking 10 years ago, but not anymore.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:01.781]  But she is.
[01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:02.621]  Her eyes are open.
[01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:04.823]  She cries when she sees her mother or daddy.
[01:04:05.518 --> 01:04:10.087]  But, uh, the estranged husband wants her, uh, wants the tube out, wants her gone.
[01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:12.772]  Gets some cash, too, when that happens.
[01:04:13.553 --> 01:04:14.475]  Guess he got a settlement.
[01:04:15.357 --> 01:04:16.238]  That's, uh, coming up.
[01:04:16.278 --> 01:04:17.200]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.122]  This is heartbreaking.
[01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:29.781]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:34.783]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:35.003 --> 01:04:40.645]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:40.885 --> 01:04:45.429]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:52.794]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:52.814 --> 01:04:53.615]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:04:53.635 --> 01:04:57.358]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:57.518 --> 01:05:00.060]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:06.965]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:26.047]  I want to talk to you about a serious problem and a number of ways it may affect you.
[01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:37.171]  If you have trouble picking up your grandchild, doing the gardening, golfing, or just getting out of bed comfortably, I want to introduce you to a revolutionary new breakthrough called Feels Like a New Knee.

[01:06:00.366 --> 01:06:01.447]  Let's hear from some of those 10,000.
[01:06:01.487 --> 01:06:04.489]  It's just absolutely miraculous.
[01:06:05.009 --> 01:06:05.870]  It's hard to believe.
[01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.311]  You've got to try it.
[01:06:07.912 --> 01:06:09.054]  Oh yeah, it was amazing.

[01:06:21.314 --> 01:06:22.955]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.276 --> 01:06:29.020]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.404]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:06:34.745 --> 01:06:44.032]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:06:44.372 --> 01:06:49.375]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:06:49.656 --> 01:06:53.678]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:58.642]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:06:59.002 --> 01:07:04.866]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:07:12.508 --> 01:07:13.368]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:13.888]  Big Brother.
[01:07:13.908 --> 01:07:14.608]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:30.442]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:31.082 --> 01:07:31.903]  You want answers?
[01:07:32.683 --> 01:07:33.584]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:33.604 --> 01:07:38.167]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:42.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:45.411 --> 01:07:54.797]  Even, even the Liberal London Independent is disgusted and outraged by the Terry Schindler-Skiavo case.
[01:07:55.577 --> 01:07:56.378]  Here's the headline.
[01:07:57.159 --> 01:08:01.901]  She can move and open her eyes, yet a court rules she must die.
[01:08:02.642 --> 01:08:03.102]  Why?
[01:08:04.303 --> 01:08:12.286]  For 13 years, Terri Schiavo has lain in a bed, severely brain damaged, fed by a tube, and unable to tell the outside world whether she wants to live or die.
[01:08:12.847 --> 01:08:13.807]  Well, that's not true.
[01:08:13.887 --> 01:08:14.688]  She's mumbled.
[01:08:14.808 --> 01:08:19.590]  She's been able to eat food years ago when she wasn't given treatment.
[01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:24.772]  Her husband, Michael, says his wife once told him she would not want her life artificially extended.
[01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:27.033]  Yeah, because it's so fashionable in the news.
[01:08:27.053 --> 01:08:27.754]  Everybody says that.
[01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:35.818]  Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, argue against the opinion of most experts that with extensive therapy she might, to some extent, recover.
[01:08:36.099 --> 01:08:37.779]  Well, there's a bunch of doctors that have said that.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.902]  On the record, even if she does not improve, they say life in any form is worth preserving.
[01:08:42.617 --> 01:08:43.357]  Yesterday, Ms.
[01:08:43.397 --> 01:08:46.518]  Chievo's husband prevailed after a court judgment on Tuesday.
[01:08:46.838 --> 01:08:50.840]  Doctors in Florida removed the feeding tube that kept the 39-year-old woman alive.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.021]  She's expected to die sometime within the next fortnight.
[01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:05.304]  Okay, and joining us is an activist who has been on the front lines of this fight to preserve life and to not have this sick
[01:09:06.258 --> 01:09:09.479]  I mean sick, sick, sick, cultured of death.
[01:09:09.539 --> 01:09:17.100]  He's Mark Pickup with Human Life Matters and you can go to his website at HumanLifeMatters.com and he's involved in the case.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.040]  We've had our family, our lawyers and others on.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.621]  Now we've got Mark Pickup involved right in the middle of this.
[01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:32.983]  Mark, you've got some disabilities yourself and we're honored to have you on the show and very thankful to you for your calling
[01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:36.961]  To stand up against this sick culture of death.
[01:09:37.101 --> 01:09:39.883]  Tell us about yourself and the latest developments in this case, sir.
[01:09:40.584 --> 01:09:43.126]  Well, Alex, it's a real privilege to be on your show.
[01:09:44.687 --> 01:09:45.708]  Yes, I am disabled.
[01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:48.771]  I have chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.
[01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.532]  My days are spent in a wheelchair now.
[01:09:51.173 --> 01:09:54.335]  My future may not be all that different to Terry's.
[01:09:55.236 --> 01:09:59.299]  So, there is a personal affinity with what's happening in her life.
[01:10:00.976 --> 01:10:03.977]  And I often wonder, my wife loves me.
[01:10:05.017 --> 01:10:08.738]  She has held me up as someone of value even when I didn't value myself.
[01:10:10.218 --> 01:10:11.038]  So I get to live.
[01:10:12.659 --> 01:10:15.459]  But Terry's husband apparently doesn't.
[01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:17.400]  Does that mean she doesn't get to live?
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.760]  Well, apparently that's what it means.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.121]  That really scares me.
[01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:25.841]  Because it puts people with disabilities in a very vulnerable position.
[01:10:26.461 --> 01:10:27.522]  If you're wanted, you stay.
[01:10:27.802 --> 01:10:28.742]  If you're not wanted, you go.
[01:10:32.483 --> 01:10:37.905]  Well, now you're involved in the case and tell us how you're involved and then give us the latest developments please.
[01:10:38.866 --> 01:10:51.831]  I was speaking in Charlotte, North Carolina two years ago and Bob and Mary Schindler approached me directly, her mom and dad, approached me directly and asked for our help, Human Life Matters help.
[01:10:53.192 --> 01:10:54.452]  That is how we got involved.
[01:10:55.393 --> 01:11:00.215]  Because we are based in Canada, we wanted to
[01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:12.330]  As each step, each door closed, each step faltered for Terry, it became gradually apparent that America was not going to protect her.
[01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:14.672]  In particular, Florida was not going to protect her.
[01:11:15.993 --> 01:11:30.685]  And so, on the 22nd of September, I asked our immigration minister up here in Canada if he would put together an asylum offer for Terry, a woman who is in essence an alien in her own country.
[01:11:32.014 --> 01:11:35.775]  And I must tell you, I have a deep and abiding love for America.
[01:11:36.295 --> 01:11:45.977]  I've spoken all across America, and one of the things that I've always admired about America was that wonderful founding Declaration of Independence.
[01:11:46.617 --> 01:11:55.719]  And I really cannot understand, when you've said, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and it goes on to talk about
[01:11:56.303 --> 01:11:57.565]  The inalienable rights.
[01:11:57.665 --> 01:11:58.587]  And what are those rights?
[01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:02.112]  The first one it says is the right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[01:12:03.113 --> 01:12:08.842]  Why is Carrie being denied her right to life if it's inalienable?
[01:12:11.696 --> 01:12:38.926]  Well, because we've got an aging population, they want to set the precedent to kill who they want, when they want, and most Americans, as well as Canadians, are humans on this green jewel that we call Earth, are ignorant of what Wesley Smith has exposed in the Wall Street Journal, and dozens of articles, and in two best-selling books, The Culture of Death, and others, that you have this death community, this group of ghouls, and that hundreds of people have been begging audibly, please give me food,
[01:12:40.928 --> 01:12:53.496]  I've sat here and we've tracked others who are in less of a state of disability than Terry.
[01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:58.379]  People just don't know about this, but we do.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.501]  Can you speak to any of the history of that?
[01:13:03.454 --> 01:13:06.035]  I know what it's like to be excluded.
[01:13:06.055 --> 01:13:11.078]  I know what it's like to have someone come up to me and say, I'd rather be dead than be like you.
[01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:12.138]  I've had that happen, sure.
[01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:15.800]  But are we a culture of death?
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.163]  When I talked about your declaration, it spoke about a culture of inclusion, of life, where everybody's included.
[01:13:23.183 --> 01:13:28.085]  It didn't say some people, it said all men, which meant everybody.
[01:13:31.452 --> 01:13:36.277]  Do we, do we, over this new age, we're going to have this utilitarian model now?
[01:13:36.838 --> 01:13:40.702]  Are we going to reject the wisdom of people like John Adams, Benjamin Franklin?
[01:13:41.508 --> 01:13:44.510]  Thomas Jefferson and go with, what, Peter Singer?
[01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:46.430]  Is that what we're going to go for?
[01:13:46.451 --> 01:14:02.078]  For those that don't know, Peter Singer is so respected, he spoke before the Governor's Conference last year, he calls babies subhuman, mackerel, old people worthless, and retarded children subhuman, and he's praised as a loving liberal.
[01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:04.259]  Yes, he is.
[01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:09.402]  I reject that, and I happen to believe that
[01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:14.148]  Most people of goodwill in America and in Canada and elsewhere reject that.
[01:14:15.308 --> 01:14:19.271]  It's time that we, as a people, stood up and said, no more.
[01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:21.892]  This is not the kind of world we want.
[01:14:22.573 --> 01:14:24.774]  A world where only the winners have a place.
[01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:27.056]  And those people who are the losers are discarded.
[01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:32.679]  Well, it's, you know, we heard that social Darwinism is what drove the robber barons.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.261]  And social Darwinism is survival of the fittest, the most wicked.
[01:14:36.502 --> 01:14:38.623]  If that was the case, we should praise Hitler.
[01:14:39.421 --> 01:14:45.525]  This is sick, this is evil, and this is a Hitlerian model of Margaret Sanger and Peter Sanger and the rest of this garbage.
[01:14:45.545 --> 01:14:53.791]  We had hundreds of thousands of women forcibly sterilized in this country, and they apologize about that later, but they always have new evil.
[01:14:55.512 --> 01:15:05.019]  Alex, you know, I wasn't going to mention this, but two days ago I got a phone call when the story was just breaking, and there was this frail little voice on the end of the line of some little old lady
[01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:09.094]  And she said to me, I was born in 1940 in Germany.
[01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:10.695]  I've been disabled since birth.
[01:15:11.816 --> 01:15:21.183]  And she then related how her parents had to hide her for three years before they could eventually sneak her out of the country.
[01:15:22.524 --> 01:15:26.628]  And she said, now you're trying to sneak a disabled person out of the country.
[01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:27.608]  Things haven't changed.
[01:15:27.929 --> 01:15:29.710]  The only thing that changed was the country's name.
[01:15:31.952 --> 01:15:34.874]  Well, people think Hitler invented all this stuff.
[01:15:34.954 --> 01:15:36.776]  It actually came from the U.S.
[01:15:37.897 --> 01:15:47.204]  Eugenics was a product of New York City, and a group of scientists there, and a group of scientists and people in England, in London, England, one of them H.G.
[01:15:47.244 --> 01:15:59.393]  Wells, who was a futurist, not just a science fiction writer, and they called for this kind of this Logan's Run type system, and for all these yuppies that think, quote, right to die is so cool, it's not the right of you to die, it's the right of the government to kill you,
[01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:00.934]  And it's going on.
[01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:05.276]  They pulled Terry's feeding tube yesterday.
[01:16:05.296 --> 01:16:08.138]  They say it'll be irreparable damage within 50 to 60 hours.
[01:16:08.538 --> 01:16:10.780]  We're now looking at 40 hours or so.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.962]  She could be dead by this weekend, dead by next week.
[01:16:13.982 --> 01:16:15.863]  We're not sure how long the torture will go on.
[01:16:15.883 --> 01:16:19.465]  We've gone through on this show what death by dehydration is like.
[01:16:19.665 --> 01:16:20.946]  It's not a pretty sight at all.
[01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:23.548]  The tongue turning black and cracking and bleeding.
[01:16:24.308 --> 01:16:25.949]  The blood leaving the skin.
[01:16:25.989 --> 01:16:27.070]  The skin sloughing off.
[01:16:28.085 --> 01:16:29.146]  Incredible torture.
[01:16:30.246 --> 01:16:33.648]  What is she facing right now and what are the appeals?
[01:16:33.688 --> 01:16:34.729]  What's going on with Jeb Bush?
[01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:40.072]  Well, we're waiting for our immigration minister to make an asylum offer to the United States government.
[01:16:41.153 --> 01:16:45.575]  Whether that's accepted at a national or state level is out of our hands.
[01:16:45.936 --> 01:16:49.958]  But what we're trying to do is offer a life-affirming alternative to starvation.
[01:16:51.539 --> 01:16:52.559]  I do not understand.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.022]  Where did we get to this point where we have
[01:16:58.058 --> 01:17:00.120]  Got to execution by starvation.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.821]  By the way, she's not in a coma.
[01:17:01.861 --> 01:17:02.702]  Her eyes are open.
[01:17:02.722 --> 01:17:03.382]  Oh, no, she's not.
[01:17:03.562 --> 01:17:04.383]  That's all fiction.
[01:17:04.503 --> 01:17:05.304]  She smiles.
[01:17:05.324 --> 01:17:06.124]  There's video of it.
[01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:07.245]  How do they say this, then?
[01:17:07.686 --> 01:17:12.069]  Well, it's like me coming into the studio with a yellow chair and saying, what do you think of my black chair?
[01:17:12.609 --> 01:17:13.330]  You say, no, it's yellow.
[01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.171]  I say, no, it's black.
[01:17:14.651 --> 01:17:18.074]  But in the face of all the evidence, they still maintain the fiction.
[01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:21.156]  This doesn't make sense, Alex.
[01:17:22.557 --> 01:17:26.220]  So what I'm saying is if she is not welcome in your country,
[01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:28.114]  Let her come to our country.
[01:17:28.154 --> 01:17:29.035]  We'll welcome her here.
[01:17:29.996 --> 01:17:35.122]  I've had calls for the last three days from countless people saying, we'll take care of her.
[01:17:35.142 --> 01:17:38.346]  We've got doctors up here that are prepared to give her the therapies that she was advised along.
[01:17:38.386 --> 01:17:39.867]  Will the husband let that happen?
[01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:40.508]  Pardon me?
[01:17:41.009 --> 01:17:44.553]  Will Mr. Schiavo allow that to happen?
[01:17:45.599 --> 01:17:47.400]  I don't think he will.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:51.982]  That's why I asked Governor Bush if he would make Terry a State of the Court.
[01:17:52.022 --> 01:17:53.723]  Which, incidentally, he should have done years ago.
[01:17:53.743 --> 01:18:01.306]  Now, why has Mr. Schiavo also denied any type of care for infections or rehabilitation over the last 13 years?
[01:18:01.346 --> 01:18:02.967]  She's gotten much worse in those 13 years.
[01:18:03.027 --> 01:18:05.528]  Well, of course she's been denied any therapy that would have helped her.
[01:18:06.528 --> 01:18:08.269]  You'd best ask the question to Michael.
[01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:09.230]  He's her legal guardian.
[01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:12.371]  He's the one that has denied her every therapy that she could have helped her.
[01:18:12.924 --> 01:18:15.647]  He's even denied her antibiotics when she had infections.
[01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:17.589]  So the question should be asked to him.
[01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:20.252]  I think there's another question should be asked to Governor Bush.
[01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:26.019]  As this has gone on, this abuse and neglect has gone on for 12 years.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.762]  Terry should have been a ward of the state years ago.
[01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:33.968]  It was evidence years ago that Michael was not looking out for her best interests.
[01:18:36.829 --> 01:18:39.910]  Well, now a lot of the money that she had in the settlement has been exhausted.
[01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:44.512]  So we hear that money was intended for therapy, not for Michael's pocket.
[01:18:45.732 --> 01:18:46.533]  Not for lawyers.
[01:18:46.893 --> 01:18:48.674]  That money was intended for Terry.
[01:18:50.154 --> 01:18:54.596]  I find it interesting that right down in Florida they're going to have the rock band, what is it, Hell on Earth?
[01:18:54.836 --> 01:18:55.316]  Yeah.
[01:18:55.416 --> 01:18:57.317]  With someone committing suicide on stage.
[01:18:57.597 --> 01:18:59.818]  But isn't that the epitome of a culture of death?
[01:19:00.698 --> 01:19:04.380]  Well, they've got the big mainstream death groups going to the rock concert.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.380]  They say it's wonderful.
[01:19:06.112 --> 01:19:08.015]  So I guess the question comes down to this, Alex.
[01:19:08.856 --> 01:19:11.481]  Does America want to be a culture of death or a culture of life?
[01:19:12.262 --> 01:19:12.783]  Stay there, sir.
[01:19:12.803 --> 01:19:13.784]  Can we do one more segment?
[01:19:13.824 --> 01:19:16.068]  I want to talk more about how we can try to save Terry.
[01:19:16.589 --> 01:19:18.832]  And we'll shift gears into other news and take calls, folks.
[01:19:19.153 --> 01:19:19.754]  We'll be right back.

[01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:26.608]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:22:26.909 --> 01:22:27.569]  Yes, it's true.
[01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:30.352]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.

[01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:48.153]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:49.534]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:22:49.675 --> 01:22:54.000]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.003]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[01:22:58.746 --> 01:22:59.126]  I think so.
[01:23:25.451 --> 01:23:30.803]  We're talking to Mark Pickup, who's working with Terry Scavo Schendler's family.
[01:23:31.946 --> 01:23:34.467]  Here's an article out of the Edmonton Sun.
[01:23:34.527 --> 01:23:36.147]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:36.588 --> 01:23:39.429]  Judges ruled disabled woman may be starved.
[01:23:39.449 --> 01:23:40.309]  This is from yesterday.
[01:23:40.329 --> 01:23:49.552]  Disabled Florida woman will lose her food supply today at noon, that was yesterday, and begin slowly starving to death at the behest of her husband who plans to remarry.
[01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:55.334]  And efforts by local activists to save Terri Schindler-Schiavo's life by bringing her to
[01:23:56.585 --> 01:23:59.166]  Edmonton appear no closer to fruition.
[01:23:59.686 --> 01:24:06.448]  I think we still have hope, said Mark Pickup of Beaumont, founder of disabled advocacy group Human Life Matters.
[01:24:07.349 --> 01:24:15.111]  We may not be able to save Terri, but I think it's incumbent on all people of goodwill to offer a life-affirming alternative to killing her.
[01:24:17.412 --> 01:24:22.194]  And wow, I think that really boils it all down there, what we're facing.
[01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.133]  She's conscious, folks.
[01:24:25.153 --> 01:24:26.995]  She's awake, blinking her eyes, looking around.
[01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:31.518]  How do you get doctors to come in and pull a tube out of her?
[01:24:32.479 --> 01:24:37.963]  And again, next time they kill somebody, we'll be a little less alarmed.
[01:24:37.983 --> 01:24:40.385]  We're just conditioned, well, that's just what they do.
[01:24:41.674 --> 01:24:55.324]  This is a very dangerous trend, Mark, and a lot of these sicko yuppies that are involved in this, the trendies out there, of the bleeding hearts that in a sick way think this is good, they're going to end up in this position, unfortunately, and reap what you sow.
[01:24:55.364 --> 01:24:56.024]  Do you agree with that?
[01:24:56.585 --> 01:24:57.185]  Absolutely.
[01:24:57.205 --> 01:25:02.549]  I'm one of those sicko yuppies that used to be concerned about self only.
[01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:09.214]  It was not until my life was threatened and impacted.
[01:25:10.003 --> 01:25:10.924]  That I began to care.
[01:25:11.084 --> 01:25:15.149]  So if I sound accusatory, there's three fingers pointing back at me.
[01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:26.103]  I think the case of Terri Schiavo is... Terri, although she can't speak, she's really asking America whether they will protect all of their citizens or just some of them.
[01:25:26.944 --> 01:25:27.525]  Is America...
[01:25:28.055 --> 01:25:31.256]  For everyone, or just the winners and the losers can go.
[01:25:31.676 --> 01:25:34.958]  Well, Christ was talking about the little children, what you do to them, you do to me.
[01:25:34.978 --> 01:25:36.538]  He's talking about the weak.
[01:25:36.759 --> 01:25:40.100]  He's talking about those that can't defend themselves.
[01:25:41.841 --> 01:25:42.401]  Absolutely.
[01:25:42.861 --> 01:25:46.823]  And you know, I think that this is a pivotal point in America's history.
[01:25:47.263 --> 01:25:57.687]  We may not have realized it until now, but you have stood up so magnificently on the international stage and spoken up for human rights when other people wouldn't.
[01:25:58.888 --> 01:26:02.869]  But if you won't protect your own, I think you lose the right and the high ground.
[01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:18.673]  Well, people pointed out, I remember 10 years ago hearing conservatives point out that if you have all these 50 million abortions, 40 million abortions, you're going to have euthanasia, you're going to have doctor-assisted suicide, and then have the state involved.
[01:26:18.733 --> 01:26:21.774]  And now in Northern Europe, people don't have a choice.
[01:26:21.814 --> 01:26:23.054]  The government basically kills them.
[01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:29.761]  And we are an aging population, folks, and the families are being broken up, and who's going to be there to take care of you?
[01:26:29.801 --> 01:26:31.583]  So what can we do to help Terry right now?
[01:26:32.723 --> 01:26:39.488]  What we can do to help Terry at this moment, let's go back to your other comment, if you're going to tamper with life at the beginning, why not tamper with it at the end, is really what they were saying.
[01:26:40.008 --> 01:26:41.750]  And we're seeing the reality of that now.
[01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:53.338]  What we can do for Terry, and what I think every American and Canadian should be doing, is calling their elected officials to say, I want, no, I expect you
[01:26:54.335 --> 01:27:06.322]  To call Governor Bush and say to him that you expect him to protect one of his voiceless, defenseless citizens.
[01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:12.166]  Well, he says he won't interfere with the court, but he interfered with the court with his brother in the election.
[01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:12.546]  I know he did.
[01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:13.767]  Let me ask you a question, Alex.
[01:27:13.847 --> 01:27:16.028]  If Terry was his daughter, how do you think he'd be behaving?
[01:27:17.989 --> 01:27:23.833]  If Terry was my daughter, I'd be tearing every door down, crashing every gate to stop the killing.
[01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:25.130]  Wouldn't you?
[01:27:27.431 --> 01:27:37.437]  Well, it's just horrible and the globalist minions smell blood here and they want it and we pray they don't kill her but if they do I think it's gonna be another rallying point
[01:27:38.115 --> 01:27:43.039]  Another victim, another martyr in all of this, and it's like the Patriot Act and the rest of it.
[01:27:43.059 --> 01:27:43.799]  We're not going to stop.
[01:27:43.819 --> 01:27:45.441]  We're not going to stop resisting this, folks.
[01:27:45.781 --> 01:27:49.504]  We're going to defeat this system of evil and death.
[01:27:50.044 --> 01:27:52.526]  How do folks... I've given out the Skiavos number and info.
[01:27:52.546 --> 01:27:57.510]  I know they're totally overwhelmed right now, but any phone numbers, any ways we can get involved, any contact points?
[01:27:58.291 --> 01:27:59.732]  Go to Terry's website.
[01:28:00.592 --> 01:28:02.594]  Terrysfight.org.
[01:28:03.935 --> 01:28:06.517]  In that website, when you get in, scroll down.
[01:28:06.557 --> 01:28:07.818]  It says, contact the media.
[01:28:08.621 --> 01:28:14.265]  Now, I don't know why they put it in there, but if you go into that site and scroll down, you'll see Governor Bush's phone number.
[01:28:15.806 --> 01:28:22.730]  Whether you're a citizen of Florida or not, he is a public representative, and his brother is the president.
[01:28:24.331 --> 01:28:27.513]  Call the office and say this will not be tolerated.
[01:28:28.434 --> 01:28:32.997]  People of goodwill across America are standing up for one defenseless woman.
[01:28:33.737 --> 01:28:36.539]  Well, I hope to have you and the family back on as this develops.
[01:28:36.559 --> 01:28:37.940]  She can be dead within days.
[01:28:38.775 --> 01:28:41.817]  We pray that this be blocked.
[01:28:42.597 --> 01:28:43.658]  This is so important.
[01:28:43.678 --> 01:28:46.839]  Your website, sir, HumanLifeMatters.com, a lot of key info there.
[01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:50.141]  TerrysFight.org, TerrysFight.org.
[01:28:50.741 --> 01:28:54.003]  Links to both of these sites, OnInfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:55.004 --> 01:28:56.064]  Thanks for your fight, sir.
[01:28:56.144 --> 01:28:59.566]  Thanks for standing up for all of us, because we're all going to be in this position.
[01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:00.767]  Most of us will be someday.
[01:29:00.807 --> 01:29:03.548]  It's a horrible precedent that's being set, and God bless you, sir.
[01:29:04.749 --> 01:29:05.289]  Take care, Mark.
[01:29:06.787 --> 01:29:08.869]  Stay back, get into the global news and your calls.
[01:29:08.909 --> 01:29:09.490]  Stay with me.
[01:29:12.052 --> 01:29:12.953]  We're on the march.
[01:29:13.454 --> 01:29:15.055]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.996 --> 01:29:18.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:21.954 --> 01:29:22.914]  Toxins are everywhere.
[01:29:22.974 --> 01:29:33.537]  They're in the air you breathe, in the food you eat, in the water you drink, and as a result, illness and disease have increased to the point that eventually we're all going to get sick with something, unless we find a way to get these toxins and metals out of the body.
[01:29:33.997 --> 01:29:39.499]  EDTA chelation treatments cost about $100 each, and take several hours at the doctor's office, not to mention the discomfort.
[01:29:39.819 --> 01:29:41.279]  But now there's Detoxamin.
[01:29:41.619 --> 01:29:46.740]  This chelation suppository is a major breakthrough and is destined to revolutionize the way we detox our bodies.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.941]  How much would you pay for 10 chelation treatments?
[01:29:49.221 --> 01:29:51.624]  Well, you can get approximately the same amount of chelating for only $2.89.95.
[01:29:53.386 --> 01:29:55.048]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:29:55.549 --> 01:30:02.357]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit thepowerhour.com to order Detoxamine today.
[01:30:02.657 --> 01:30:08.344]  Hey, get the lead out, along with the mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and all the other stuff that gunks up your arteries and organs.
[01:30:08.806 --> 01:30:12.932]  Dr. Bruce Halstead, the grandfather of chelation, says Detoxi-Min works, and it does.
[01:30:13.252 --> 01:30:15.755]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowerhour.com and detoxify with Detoxi-Min.
[01:30:20.865 --> 01:30:22.485]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:22.846 --> 01:30:28.587]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:30:28.827 --> 01:30:33.969]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:43.611]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:30:43.952 --> 01:30:48.873]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:30:49.213 --> 01:30:53.219]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:30:53.419 --> 01:30:58.227]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:30:58.567 --> 01:31:04.476]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:31:04.816 --> 01:31:13.851]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:15.053]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:15.093 --> 01:31:16.115]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:31.793]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:31:31.974 --> 01:31:39.576]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:31:39.816 --> 01:31:42.961]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:31:43.221 --> 01:31:49.029]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:31:49.249 --> 01:31:55.418]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:31:55.758 --> 01:31:59.659]  The Berkey Light is transparent so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:31:59.699 --> 01:32:01.620]  The water level is always visible.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:07.722]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in an emergency situation.
[01:32:07.962 --> 01:32:11.723]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:32:11.803 --> 01:32:12.483]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:32:22.711 --> 01:32:25.474]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:32:26.054 --> 01:32:29.397]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.041]  All right, my friends.
[01:32:33.441 --> 01:32:35.984]  I'm gonna take five calls as quickly as possible.
[01:32:36.004 --> 01:32:41.329]  And then I'm gonna get into a bunch of news that we really need to cover, so stay with us, folks.
[01:32:41.409 --> 01:32:42.730]  Really key information coming up.
[01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:47.675]  The Terry Schiavo Schindler story really tears my heart out.
[01:32:48.658 --> 01:32:51.100]  And I know instinctively it affects myself and my family.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.040]  It's a horrible future.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:52.901]  We've got to change it.
[01:32:53.181 --> 01:32:54.042]  We've got to stop it.
[01:32:55.162 --> 01:32:56.163]  Just to address something on air.
[01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.184]  I addressed it last hour.
[01:32:57.424 --> 01:32:58.705]  I love all our callers.
[01:32:59.285 --> 01:33:02.968]  Whether you call every other day or you called once a year.
[01:33:04.188 --> 01:33:07.951]  I just every day get emails and calls and letters that people can't get in.
[01:33:10.169 --> 01:33:10.630]  We're good to go.
[01:33:35.185 --> 01:33:36.406]  I'm getting my calls confused now.
[01:33:38.347 --> 01:33:42.890]  We're going to go to Bill, Betty, Ron, and then Brock and Mark.
[01:33:43.591 --> 01:33:46.072]  Right now, let's go to Bill in Pennsylvania.
[01:33:46.112 --> 01:33:46.953]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:33:46.993 --> 01:33:47.393]  Go ahead.
[01:33:47.934 --> 01:33:49.675]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:33:49.855 --> 01:33:54.318]  Basically, what I had to say was basically a rehash of what you and Mark just talked about, so I'll keep it short.
[01:33:54.338 --> 01:34:01.302]  One answer to the dilemma about the Pledge of Allegiance is just change it to read promptly, One Nation Without God.
[01:34:02.345 --> 01:34:03.625]  Well, let's be honest, yeah.
[01:34:03.865 --> 01:34:28.031]  I'm looking at the Philadelphia Inquirer this morning, and they have a write-up here, and I just went to rounds with Chris Gray, who is an Inquirer staff writer, who wrote this article, and it says, because Terri Scalvo is in a persistent vegetative state with no cognition, she will feel little pain now that the tube feeding her water and nutrients through her abdomen have been removed, said Ronald Schoenwetter, Chief Medical Officer.
[01:34:28.051 --> 01:34:29.791]  No wonder they're giving her painkillers.
[01:34:31.485 --> 01:34:39.490]  Well, I wanted this, I've been following it somewhat, when Jackie Petrou has a program 9 o'clock Eastern, I mention it because it's not in conflict with the show.
[01:34:39.730 --> 01:34:39.970]  Sure, sure.
[01:34:40.530 --> 01:34:47.714]  And this guy is quoted as saying, this Michael, this piece of crud is quoted as saying, why isn't the B, why isn't the bitch dead yet?
[01:34:47.994 --> 01:34:54.758]  He said that, he's also made public that he's going to take the settlement money when she's dead and buy a boat and take it to where you are.
[01:34:55.779 --> 01:34:59.541]  This is what we're dealing with, but I see the bottom line really as it's a precursor
[01:35:00.123 --> 01:35:03.125]  They try to condition all of us to accepting this right to die thing.
[01:35:03.225 --> 01:35:09.148]  And these news articles, we've been killing hundreds of people like this that we know of, these news articles are all saying she's a vegetable.
[01:35:09.468 --> 01:35:14.890]  There's video of her a month ago, up, sitting up, eyes blinking, looking at her mother, smiling.
[01:35:15.691 --> 01:35:18.692]  That's right, I asked Chris Greger, I asked, where'd you get your information?
[01:35:18.732 --> 01:35:20.533]  He said, well, we just do objective reporting.
[01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:22.674]  I said, well, it doesn't look all that objective to me.
[01:35:22.975 --> 01:35:26.176]  Did you ask her if you've been to terroristfight.org and watched the video of her?
[01:35:26.796 --> 01:35:29.698]  I wasn't aware of that website, but I told her about a jacket through Sweet Liberty.
[01:35:30.847 --> 01:35:32.568]  I know it is.
[01:35:33.628 --> 01:35:34.889]  So what else is on your mind?
[01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:36.129]  I mean, it's a terrible case.
[01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:37.450]  That's about all.
[01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:39.270]  I'm just glad you got Mark on the air.
[01:35:41.751 --> 01:35:45.072]  Basically, I don't have much more but just to rehash what you guys already discussed.
[01:35:45.633 --> 01:35:46.993]  Alright, thank you for the call, sir.
[01:35:47.013 --> 01:35:48.354]  I appreciate it.
[01:35:48.414 --> 01:35:49.354]  Bill, good to hear from you.
[01:35:49.434 --> 01:35:50.834]  Betty in Indiana.
[01:35:50.894 --> 01:35:51.715]  Betty, you're on the air.
[01:35:51.795 --> 01:35:52.135]  Go ahead.
[01:35:54.019 --> 01:35:55.580]  I never really thought I'd get through.
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.500]  Well, you are.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.080]  You're on the air.
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:57.600]  Go ahead.
[01:35:57.881 --> 01:35:58.401]  I guess so.
[01:35:58.561 --> 01:35:58.941]  Okay.
[01:35:59.461 --> 01:36:01.602]  I heard the gentleman that has MS.
[01:36:02.802 --> 01:36:04.023]  And I've got MS, too.
[01:36:04.843 --> 01:36:08.325]  And I've had it for, oh, 25 years.
[01:36:09.165 --> 01:36:10.666]  And I used to drive school bus.
[01:36:11.646 --> 01:36:16.908]  And I even, well, my kids all like being on the bus.
[01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.349]  So, I mean, I'm not real square or whatever.
[01:36:19.469 --> 01:36:20.009]  Buddy-duddy.
[01:36:23.061 --> 01:36:25.003]  I kind of look at it in a strange way.
[01:36:25.903 --> 01:36:38.172]  I'm in a wheelchair, and my husband and I just celebrated our 40th anniversary, so it's not like I'm a widow or a divorcee or I stay by myself.
[01:36:38.693 --> 01:36:43.536]  My children and my husband and my son, I know they all love me.
[01:36:43.757 --> 01:36:45.138]  You have a loving family.
[01:36:45.298 --> 01:36:45.638]  I do.
[01:36:45.658 --> 01:36:51.382]  Which is the greatest asset you can have after a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[01:36:52.950 --> 01:37:03.182]  And if I should die tomorrow, I don't worry about where I'll go, because I know that the Lord put me here, and when He thinks it's time to get out of here,
[01:37:03.806 --> 01:37:04.526]  Then he'll take me.
[01:37:04.967 --> 01:37:05.727]  Here's the problem.
[01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:18.155]  Even when families don't want to kill family members now, because of the economy and the cost of health care, if you go on their welfare system, they'll trick you into signing folks over as a ward of the state, and the state will kill you.
[01:37:18.175 --> 01:37:19.636]  A lot of these cases are the state doing it.
[01:37:20.196 --> 01:37:22.197]  It's not always just family doing it.
[01:37:22.458 --> 01:37:24.739]  This is a very scary future we're entering.
[01:37:25.259 --> 01:37:26.000]  You got that right.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.342]  And you know that the government will do it twice as fast as anybody else.
[01:37:30.843 --> 01:37:32.824]  I mean, the chemtrails that they've
[01:37:33.427 --> 01:37:36.530]  They put out there, I mean those are definitely not healthy.
[01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:42.134]  They admit thousands of biological tests on the American people as well as chemical tests.
[01:37:42.574 --> 01:37:42.835]  Right.
[01:37:44.796 --> 01:37:49.880]  But I'm happy and like I said my husband loves me dearly and I love him dearly.
[01:37:50.681 --> 01:37:56.726]  You don't live with somebody for 40 years and be suffering and not like the person.
[01:37:59.451 --> 01:38:03.412]  Like I said, I've got different things going with the MS.
[01:38:03.512 --> 01:38:06.473]  I have a pump, and I have a port.
[01:38:07.293 --> 01:38:12.595]  And so whenever we find anything for the MS, we go for it.
[01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:21.297]  Can't afford a whole lot, but whatever it costs, my husband's more than willing to do it.
[01:38:22.257 --> 01:38:26.118]  Well, that's because he's a good human being and has love in his heart, and you're blessed to have him.
[01:38:26.158 --> 01:38:26.899]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:26.939 --> 01:38:27.779]  Good to hear from you, Betty.
[01:38:29.134 --> 01:38:31.795]  Let's now talk to Ron in New York.
[01:38:31.875 --> 01:38:32.596]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:38:32.616 --> 01:38:33.376]  Hi, Alex.
[01:38:33.476 --> 01:38:37.918]  I don't want to get sidetracked on the situation with Mary Schiavo, but I'll just say this.
[01:38:38.598 --> 01:38:42.780]  Why, if they have to do that evil thing, do they have to use such a torturous methodology?
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:47.682]  We're more considerate about the humanity in employing executions against convicted murderers.
[01:38:48.382 --> 01:38:49.383]  They're starving her to death.
[01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:50.343]  That's slow and painful.
[01:38:50.928 --> 01:38:53.671]  And Jeb Bush is the first magistrate of the state of Florida.
[01:38:53.731 --> 01:38:55.332]  He could intercede if he really wanted to.
[01:38:55.452 --> 01:38:58.955]  Oh, he could sign a clemency pardon, whatever.
[01:38:59.015 --> 01:39:02.418]  He could instantly have her under care and take care of her.
[01:39:02.658 --> 01:39:03.619]  Right, he has those powers.
[01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:04.961]  But I want to move on to this.
[01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:06.762]  Two things.
[01:39:07.162 --> 01:39:10.185]  I don't know if you're familiar with this story, but I thought it was an eye-catching story.
[01:39:10.646 --> 01:39:17.712]  You were talking about people who were mistreated by Social Services Department, accused of child abuse and things of that nature.
[01:39:18.388 --> 01:39:19.409]  Have you read the story?
[01:39:19.469 --> 01:39:23.772]  It was in Monday's New York Post about Rod Serling, famous Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame.
[01:39:24.352 --> 01:39:27.955]  His daughter, Anna Sutton, she's suing for $10 million.
[01:39:28.655 --> 01:39:33.138]  She was the victim of what she described as a Twilight Zone episode in a child abuse matter.
[01:39:34.399 --> 01:39:37.601]  She was cleared of everything at the end, and now she's suing.
[01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:39.903]  Ron, we always call in with really important stories.
[01:39:39.943 --> 01:39:43.045]  You were the one the day of the New York Post article about him going after
[01:39:43.812 --> 01:39:50.939]  The 15-year-old graduating from college with 3.84, and you emailed me that and I didn't get it from you, and now you dropped this on us.
[01:39:50.979 --> 01:39:55.263]  Please email it to tips at InfoWars.com if it's still in the New York Post.
[01:39:55.423 --> 01:39:57.204]  I don't have a computer, but I could give it.
[01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:57.985]  It's off the AP wire.
[01:39:58.005 --> 01:39:58.926]  Well, I know you mentioned it.
[01:39:58.966 --> 01:40:02.669]  Somebody emailed it to me, but you're telling me they went after Rod Serling's daughter.
[01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:04.351]  What did the story say?
[01:40:05.365 --> 01:40:06.945]  Her daughter's had a mental problem.
[01:40:06.985 --> 01:40:10.806]  She went to her school, okay, to talk to school psychologists.
[01:40:10.886 --> 01:40:12.467]  She lied about being abused.
[01:40:12.567 --> 01:40:13.907]  It turned out it was a total lie.
[01:40:14.987 --> 01:40:19.428]  The school psychologist tells the Department of Social Services.
[01:40:19.488 --> 01:40:20.609]  It's in Ithaca, New York.
[01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:25.590]  I'm very familiar with that area, and they really are off the beam over there when you're talking about social services.
[01:40:27.717 --> 01:40:31.300]  So they call up the mother, or rather the mother calls the school to speak to the psychologist.
[01:40:31.801 --> 01:40:37.926]  The psychologist, I guess, does a three-way calling thing to the Department of Social Services, and the whole process goes in effect.
[01:40:38.347 --> 01:40:44.112]  They take her daughter, the Suttons, which that's her married name, Sutton, do not see their daughter.
[01:40:44.192 --> 01:40:45.313]  Daughter's put in foster care.
[01:40:45.333 --> 01:40:48.055]  They have to fight through the court for about a year.
[01:40:48.095 --> 01:40:50.037]  They were deprived of the right to see their daughter.
[01:40:50.237 --> 01:40:50.678]  They win.
[01:40:50.958 --> 01:40:52.039]  They're innocent, okay?
[01:40:52.617 --> 01:40:54.659]  Now, um, Ms.
[01:40:54.699 --> 01:41:02.344]  Sutton, Anna Sutton, and her husband are suing, in federal court in Syracuse, New York, are suing the Department of Social Services that did this to them.
[01:41:02.364 --> 01:41:04.706]  And I would imagine that she's got quite an inheritance.
[01:41:05.006 --> 01:41:06.387]  I've seen them go after rich people.
[01:41:07.208 --> 01:41:08.489]  And, I mean, that's the point, folks.
[01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:09.489]  It's not just the poor people.
[01:41:09.509 --> 01:41:10.610]  They're done feeding on them.
[01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:14.373]  They've run out of the lions have eaten all the gazelles in that area.
[01:41:14.393 --> 01:41:16.294]  And that's, that's what it comes down to.
[01:41:16.334 --> 01:41:18.976]  And, you know, I'm very familiar with that area of New York State.
[01:41:18.996 --> 01:41:20.137]  I have family there, everything.
[01:41:20.197 --> 01:41:20.958]  I know it intimately.
[01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.557]  This Rod Serling, he came from that area.
[01:41:23.577 --> 01:41:26.218]  I mean, the family was highly regarded in Ithaca, New York.
[01:41:26.298 --> 01:41:27.078]  They turned on them.
[01:41:27.098 --> 01:41:33.200]  Well, what they do is, almost all public schools have, by 7th or 8th grade, you write journals on your parents.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:35.901]  They say your parents, this even happened when I was in school, folks, okay?
[01:41:36.722 --> 01:41:41.003]  You write journals on your parents, and now it's done on a computer that's put in a database.
[01:41:41.063 --> 01:41:44.445]  The cameras in the classrooms, down in thousands of schools, by the way, not just Mississippi.
[01:41:45.125 --> 01:41:46.065]  Not just Louisiana.
[01:41:46.946 --> 01:41:48.006]  Down in Milwaukee, Mississippi.
[01:41:48.772 --> 01:41:52.073]  All of this goes, quote, onto the internet and is federally accessible.
[01:41:52.113 --> 01:41:54.594]  They overlook what you're writing, what you're talking about.
[01:41:55.494 --> 01:42:02.517]  They tell you, write whatever you want, and they call you before these counselors and they say, what do your parents do to you, or they mean to you?
[01:42:02.797 --> 01:42:04.337]  We can do something about that.
[01:42:05.058 --> 01:42:17.622]  Your child's mad at you, they say something, and then the child later, you know, reneges on the lie because now they're in a torturous situation, being beat up by the foster care parents, being, you know, basically starved because they're just a money-making operation.
[01:42:18.274 --> 01:42:19.494]  Well, that's pretty much what happened.
[01:42:19.514 --> 01:42:20.455]  Their daughter was mad at them.
[01:42:20.475 --> 01:42:23.395]  She fabricated a story like that, and they went through hell.
[01:42:23.995 --> 01:42:25.276]  That might be an interesting story.
[01:42:25.296 --> 01:42:28.317]  It was, like I said, on the AP Wire, obviously.
[01:42:28.337 --> 01:42:29.577]  You said New York Post.
[01:42:29.737 --> 01:42:34.218]  Yeah, Mondays, October 13th, page 12 in the New York Post.
[01:42:35.498 --> 01:42:39.620]  Another thing, did you ever get that letter I sent you, Alex, about the Matrix from my congressman?
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:40.960]  Yes, I did.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.380]  Thank you.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.200]  Okay, I just wanted to make sure of that.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.281]  And secondly, thirdly, actually,
[01:42:45.751 --> 01:42:49.434]  Do you have a phone number where people can reach Angel Shamaya's group?
[01:42:50.315 --> 01:42:54.298]  You know, their website is keepinbeararms.com, and I don't have that pulled up in front of me.
[01:42:55.098 --> 01:42:55.198]  Oh.
[01:42:55.459 --> 01:42:57.260]  I don't allow myself a computer when I'm on air.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:00.403]  I really should, but in the past I've ended up surfing and not paying attention.
[01:43:00.643 --> 01:43:01.043]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:01.063 --> 01:43:03.745]  I don't have... I'm sorry, I already cut you off.
[01:43:03.765 --> 01:43:04.246]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:04.746 --> 01:43:05.367]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:05.667 --> 01:43:10.611]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Brock in Canada, and then Mark in Minnesota, and that's it for calls this August.
[01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:11.531]  I want to cover news.
[01:43:11.571 --> 01:43:12.192]  Go ahead, Brock.
[01:43:12.748 --> 01:43:22.754]  Hello Alex, in California we recently had a recall of the governor and the governor technically did nothing illegal in Florida.
[01:43:22.774 --> 01:43:32.440]  And the people running the Enron scam like Arnold are the saviors to fix it and then now Bush is meeting Arnold tomorrow and it's broken in the AP, then it's a scripted meeting, they both have scripts.
[01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:42.126]  My point being that in Florida we have a governor who has done something illegal by not stepping in and saving
[01:43:42.631 --> 01:43:51.399]  Murder from happening and I think that everyone should recall the governor of Florida because he has done something illegal.
[01:43:52.079 --> 01:43:52.560]  Why not?
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:53.461]  It's also torture.
[01:43:55.750 --> 01:44:00.596]  As the last caller, Ron, said, I mean, we've gone through it with Wesley Smith here, we've had doctors on.
[01:44:01.337 --> 01:44:09.988]  Sometimes you can live 10 days, 14 days, and I mean, your skin starts cracking and bleeding, your tongue swells up, turns black, cracks, the water all goes to the core organs.
[01:44:10.448 --> 01:44:13.412]  I mean, folks, this is one of the most torturous ways to die.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:21.822]  Well, if everyone launched a petition to recall Governor Bush, it would get some national limelight.
[01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.823]  They need to get video of her dying.
[01:44:24.263 --> 01:44:26.784]  Everybody needs to see the torturous death.
[01:44:26.824 --> 01:44:30.945]  Maybe a stopgap film where you shoot a photo every hour.
[01:44:30.965 --> 01:44:32.566]  I agree.
[01:44:33.126 --> 01:44:38.507]  To show her wither, shrivel up, turn black, cracked skin, blood coming out her mouth.
[01:44:38.547 --> 01:44:39.928]  We need to see the love.
[01:44:41.042 --> 01:44:45.865]  And show everyone that Governor Bush chose for this to happen.
[01:44:46.105 --> 01:44:47.787]  He's acting like, oh, I'll do something.
[01:44:47.827 --> 01:44:49.248]  But the family keeps begging him.
[01:44:49.268 --> 01:44:50.588]  He could end this instantly.
[01:44:50.809 --> 01:44:51.549]  Yes, he could.
[01:44:51.609 --> 01:44:55.392]  And I think everyone needs to know that loud and so very clear.
[01:44:55.472 --> 01:44:56.632]  And that'll get through.
[01:44:58.674 --> 01:44:58.954]  All right.
[01:44:58.994 --> 01:44:59.454]  Thank you, Barack.
[01:44:59.474 --> 01:44:59.935]  Great points.
[01:45:00.295 --> 01:45:01.055]  Mark in Minnesota.
[01:45:01.095 --> 01:45:01.356]  Go ahead.
[01:45:01.376 --> 01:45:02.076]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:45:03.417 --> 01:45:04.217]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:04.818 --> 01:45:09.341]  I wasn't sure if I really wanted to do this, because you might get other people doing the same thing.
[01:45:10.459 --> 01:45:13.542]  You're saying you have a friend named Ronnie who has melanoma?
[01:45:14.664 --> 01:45:14.944]  Yes.
[01:45:15.284 --> 01:45:17.086]  I use some stuff.
[01:45:17.467 --> 01:45:19.248]  I'm sure you've probably heard of Harry Hoxie?
[01:45:20.249 --> 01:45:20.470]  No.
[01:45:21.471 --> 01:45:27.237]  I can tell you that the blood root, the topical cell, pretty amazing stuff.
[01:45:28.854 --> 01:45:29.874]  Sorry to hear about that.
[01:45:30.074 --> 01:45:31.075]  I'll keep them in my prayers.
[01:45:31.095 --> 01:45:39.898]  I know there's a lot of alternative treatments, but everybody believes in the doctors and the system, and there's certainly some good there and some bad there, and there's some good and bad in the supplement market.
[01:45:39.918 --> 01:45:42.478]  You can't believe all of it, but I know there's a lot of treatments.
[01:45:42.558 --> 01:45:46.140]  I had a tumor that was pulled out of my body with this stuff.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.221]  It's pretty effective with like melanoma, and I don't sell this stuff or anything, but
[01:45:50.871 --> 01:45:52.993]  You know, you can probably find... What's it called?
[01:45:53.513 --> 01:46:02.419]  If you look up, like, the word blood root, like, look up the word blood root cells, cancer cells, and then the word blood root, you'll find all sorts of different things.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.704]  You can probably get, like, a jar of it, which would be... Is that the Native American treatment?
[01:46:09.704 --> 01:46:11.766]  Yeah, it's got, like, blood root and zinc chloride.
[01:46:11.806 --> 01:46:16.349]  I know people that have successfully put that on skin cancers, but I'm not going to send her any medical advice.
[01:46:16.569 --> 01:46:19.271]  But, now, with this teria chevo,
[01:46:21.192 --> 01:46:26.396]  I can't understand why they don't just go in there and take her, the family.
[01:46:26.416 --> 01:46:29.038]  It seems like that would be more than justified.
[01:46:29.058 --> 01:46:34.802]  Well, see, right after she got bones broken, it wasn't a heart attack, folks.
[01:46:34.822 --> 01:46:36.763]  And right after, evidence shows she'd been strangled.
[01:46:37.682 --> 01:46:38.483]  We don't know by who.
[01:46:39.923 --> 01:46:42.185]  The husband comes in and says, oh, the lawyer said it'll be simple.
[01:46:42.205 --> 01:46:43.686]  You just sign over all your rights to me.
[01:46:43.706 --> 01:46:45.247]  And they go, oh, sure, you know, crying.
[01:46:45.727 --> 01:46:46.427]  Oh, just a form.
[01:46:46.467 --> 01:46:47.068]  Here, sign.
[01:46:47.748 --> 01:46:51.050]  And that's where all this basically extrapolated from.
[01:46:51.370 --> 01:46:52.231]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[01:46:52.251 --> 01:46:54.713]  I really appreciate it.
[01:46:54.773 --> 01:46:58.635]  We'll shift gears back into that and get into a bunch of other news in the next hour and go back to calls.
[01:46:58.655 --> 01:46:59.836]  But right now, I've got to go into news here.
[01:47:01.337 --> 01:47:03.098]  Because this is all so vitally important.
[01:47:03.138 --> 01:47:03.758]  Let's go with it.
[01:47:03.958 --> 01:47:04.959]  This is from CNN.
[01:47:05.899 --> 01:47:06.000]  U.S.
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:06.580]  troops battle.
[01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:08.802]  An Iraqi-Syrian border.
[01:47:09.243 --> 01:47:09.543]  U.S.
[01:47:09.563 --> 01:47:16.169]  troops came under fire early Wednesday from a group of people the coalition said was trying to cross illegally into Iraq from Syria.
[01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:20.213]  The resulting gun battle left several of the alleged infiltrators dead, coalition officials said.
[01:47:20.613 --> 01:47:20.993]  No U.S.
[01:47:21.033 --> 01:47:22.074]  soldiers were reported wounded.
[01:47:22.094 --> 01:47:26.699]  Well, that's good, but last time they claimed the Syrians attacked, later they had to admit that the U.S.
[01:47:26.739 --> 01:47:27.079]  attacked.
[01:47:28.405 --> 01:47:29.748]  They're trying to get a war going.
[01:47:29.888 --> 01:47:31.330]  Israel's attacking Syria.
[01:47:32.592 --> 01:47:34.836]  Syria supposedly got the terrorists striking back.
[01:47:35.698 --> 01:47:39.144]  And now they're passing sanctions against Syria.
[01:47:39.184 --> 01:47:40.747]  See, I told you they're going to Syria, folks!
[01:47:41.377 --> 01:47:45.318]  My cousin's a high-level officer, you know, in all this, and he's been told they're going in.
[01:47:45.838 --> 01:47:46.218]  No U.S.
[01:47:46.238 --> 01:47:47.798]  soldiers were reported wounded, but a U.S.
[01:47:47.858 --> 01:47:50.339]  observation helicopter was forced down after being hit by small arms fire.
[01:47:50.699 --> 01:47:59.441]  Flash began about midnight Tuesday when ground observers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division noticed a group of people trying to enter Iraq without going through an official crossing.
[01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:01.561]  So there's that.
[01:48:02.161 --> 01:48:05.882]  On the good news front, Senators joined forces to roll back parts of Patriot Act.
[01:48:05.902 --> 01:48:07.023]  How about we roll back the whole thing?
[01:48:07.383 --> 01:48:09.143]  See, they admit there's no real sunset.
[01:48:10.124 --> 01:48:12.908]  Uh, the, uh, section 205 of the sunset provision.
[01:48:13.309 --> 01:48:14.130]  Is it 203?
[01:48:14.170 --> 01:48:14.991]  My memory's failing.
[01:48:16.293 --> 01:48:18.536]  It just sunsets little, little provisions.
[01:48:18.576 --> 01:48:19.438]  The key stuff, 213, 215, it's not...
[01:48:21.641 --> 01:48:22.201]  We're good to go.
[01:48:41.876 --> 01:48:55.499]  Senator Larry Craig, Idaho Republican, and Mr. Durbin, joint representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union and American Conservative Union, as well as the Eagle Forum, among others yesterday, introduced the Security and Freedom Insure Safe Act.
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:57.560]  Now, I haven't read it yet.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.480]  I've read the House version.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:48:59.160]  It's okay.
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:00.701]  I have the Senate version.
[01:49:00.941 --> 01:49:01.881]  I'll check into it.
[01:49:02.961 --> 01:49:05.462]  Maybe you can go read it and call in and tell us next hour what's in it.
[01:49:05.482 --> 01:49:09.703]  A lot of you are better at reading laws than I am and pointing out a lot of great stuff for us.
[01:49:11.005 --> 01:49:17.110]  Again, the good news is the forced inoculation plan they tried to use color of law on the police and medical workers has fallen through.
[01:49:18.071 --> 01:49:20.193]  Smallpox vaccination plans ceased.
[01:49:21.134 --> 01:49:32.764]  USA Today, less than a year after President Bush announced a smallpox vaccination plan to protect Americans in the event of a terrorist attack, a fraction of the expected number of health workers have been immunized and the much-valued program is dead in the water.
[01:49:34.105 --> 01:49:34.745]  Very important.
[01:49:35.225 --> 01:49:37.966]  Matrix system would put privacy on endangered list.
[01:49:38.406 --> 01:49:43.488]  In the sci-fi thriller movie, The Matrix, a clueless slacker is offered a choice.
[01:49:43.548 --> 01:49:51.211]  Swallow the blue pill or continue life as he knows it, or swallow a red pill and learn the truth about the fearsome computer network secretly controlling humankind.
[01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:52.431]  That's Hollywood.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.061]  Here's real life.
[01:49:54.341 --> 01:50:02.808]  Georgia, and a dozen other states, it's all of them folks, have quietly chosen to join a vast computerized database purported to help fight crime and root out terrorism.
[01:50:02.848 --> 01:50:04.469]  See, crime and terror now.
[01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:06.410]  It too is called MATRIX.
[01:50:07.491 --> 01:50:11.595]  A tortured acronym of Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange.
[01:50:13.056 --> 01:50:14.217]  We'll come back with that.
[01:50:15.277 --> 01:50:16.659]  It's called ECHELON.
[01:50:16.699 --> 01:50:18.340]  You know it as Total Information Awareness.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.581]  Now morphing into MATRIX.
[01:50:21.753 --> 01:50:29.261]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:50:29.542 --> 01:50:40.454]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:50:40.714 --> 01:50:42.515]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:50:42.795 --> 01:50:46.096]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:50:46.456 --> 01:50:56.920]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:57.701]  That's right!
[01:50:57.881 --> 01:51:05.003]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:05.283 --> 01:51:09.365]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:51:09.565 --> 01:51:16.811]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:16.971 --> 01:51:21.075]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:21.095 --> 01:51:26.239]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:26.419 --> 01:51:30.843]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:31.003 --> 01:51:35.367]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:35.407 --> 01:51:36.728]  The New World Order
[01:51:37.443 --> 01:51:37.843]  Can emerge.
[01:51:38.523 --> 01:51:42.745]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:42.805 --> 01:51:49.748]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:49.868 --> 01:51:51.909]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:52.269 --> 01:51:53.229]  Homeland Security.
[01:51:53.429 --> 01:51:54.210]  Executive orders.
[01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:55.330]  Force vaccinations.
[01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:56.350]  We're good to go.
[01:52:16.817 --> 01:52:17.457]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:52:17.577 --> 01:52:20.878]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:52:21.118 --> 01:52:23.339]  Hey, John Stadtmiller here, and I have a question for you.
[01:52:23.559 --> 01:52:25.080]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:28.080]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[01:52:28.301 --> 01:52:30.201]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[01:52:30.461 --> 01:52:33.422]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[01:52:33.722 --> 01:52:35.523]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[01:52:35.843 --> 01:52:39.584]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.822]  There's a safe and effective way to energize your life naturally.
[01:52:43.102 --> 01:52:45.124]  It's called Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[01:52:45.504 --> 01:52:48.786]  If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on one of nature's best kept secrets.
[01:52:49.166 --> 01:52:56.611]  Made naturally in a beehive, not manufactured in a lab, Royal Jelly is used by people around the world for energy, vitality and stamina.
[01:52:56.871 --> 01:52:58.753]  Call Be Alive today to find out more.
[01:52:58.913 --> 01:53:08.920]  Call toll free 866-321-1900 to order your supply of energizing Be Alive Royal Jelly and ask how you can get a free one month supply with your order.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.741]  Toll free 866-321-1900.
[01:53:11.101 --> 01:53:17.927]  Tell them John sent you and put an end to your energy crisis with Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[01:53:17.947 --> 01:53:18.187]  866-321-1900.
[01:53:18.207 --> 01:53:19.428]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:19.568 --> 01:53:26.234]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:33.628 --> 01:53:42.150]  All right, we've got the third hour coming up, and I'm going to continue for about 20 minutes into the next hour covering news that I've got to get to that's so just incredible and important.
[01:53:43.410 --> 01:53:49.692]  And of course, we're going to take more calls then for the last 40 minutes of the show with a smattering of other articles.
[01:53:51.252 --> 01:53:55.173]  Matrix system would put privacy on endangered list.
[01:53:55.813 --> 01:53:57.134]  Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[01:53:58.554 --> 01:54:02.795]  That goes on to say that the matrix system is for crime and terror.
[01:54:03.473 --> 01:54:09.357]  And it's everything you do, everything you buy, your phone records, your credit reports, everything!
[01:54:10.237 --> 01:54:14.160]  And they admit it was already set up years ago with the states reporting to the feds data.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:27.748]  And our lady at PSAC, the new gun control bill, they call it the strengthening the instant check system, will put the gun owners on the top of that list and get all that data on you and use that as another funding mechanism for this.
[01:54:29.609 --> 01:54:30.810]  Matrix was created by
[01:54:32.404 --> 01:54:36.905]  Senescent Incorporated, a Florida-based company, with the help of the $12 million in taxpayer funds.
[01:54:37.105 --> 01:54:38.265]  It's always propaganda.
[01:54:39.625 --> 01:54:39.985]  Oh, really?
[01:54:40.005 --> 01:54:42.826]  The data collection points the federal computers put in locally?
[01:54:43.246 --> 01:54:46.067]  The Echelon and NSA and CIA?
[01:54:47.907 --> 01:54:50.728]  And the FBI systems to go over the email?
[01:54:51.028 --> 01:54:52.388]  No, it wasn't created by them.
[01:54:52.688 --> 01:54:57.089]  There's always a new name, a new group, and when you oppose that, it'll go, OK, we're canceling it.
[01:54:57.389 --> 01:54:58.429]  But the system goes on.
[01:55:00.402 --> 01:55:16.714]  And it goes on to say, with taxpayer-funded grants from the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, adding to its cloak-and-dagger mystique, the millionaire founder, Hank Asher, was forced to serve, sever ties with the company after reports surfaced that he was a former drug smuggler and government informant.
[01:55:17.275 --> 01:55:18.756]  Yeah, that's who their fronts are.
[01:55:19.571 --> 01:55:28.116]  The Matrix system works by amassing tetrabytes of confidential information about private citizens, up to and including social security numbers and the addresses of their neighbors.
[01:55:28.616 --> 01:55:37.521]  Matrix then cross-references other public and private data, including credit and property records, and makes the intelligence available by participating police departments at lightning speed.
[01:55:38.202 --> 01:55:45.246]  They're saying magazines, newspapers, books will all have embedded in them an RFID, just like the money does, and that's going to be tracked too.
[01:55:46.949 --> 01:55:55.472]  And it goes, in a belated spasm of common sense, they've announced it to the State Attorney General's Office to review Georgia's proposed participation in the Matrix System.
[01:55:55.492 --> 01:55:57.093]  And they're doing that because of heat.
[01:55:57.433 --> 01:55:58.153]  It goes forward.
[01:55:58.894 --> 01:56:00.594]  I'm not trying to say we can't win this thing.
[01:56:00.614 --> 01:56:02.915]  We've got to be honest about the system and what it really is.
[01:56:04.136 --> 01:56:05.916]  Total information's been cancelled.
[01:56:06.296 --> 01:56:07.677]  The Patriot Act's been cancelled.
[01:56:07.737 --> 01:56:08.517]  No, it hasn't.
[01:56:09.117 --> 01:56:10.418]  We're in a fight to, but
[01:56:11.181 --> 01:56:16.264]  You gotta finish this bully off, folks, and believe me, he's not even stumbling around yet.
[01:56:16.744 --> 01:56:18.025]  You haven't even dazed him yet.
[01:56:18.065 --> 01:56:20.587]  Yeah, he's mad, he's got a few teeth knocked out and a bloody nose.
[01:56:20.867 --> 01:56:21.808]  So do we, okay?
[01:56:23.349 --> 01:56:27.991]  Frankly, we're dazed stumbling around, but you can FIRE UP and take it back against him!
[01:56:28.772 --> 01:56:32.774]  Alright, uh, I'll get back to work or strike over Big Brother Monitoring System.
[01:56:33.575 --> 01:56:36.096]  Chi-Coms go into space on a manned mission.
[01:56:37.057 --> 01:56:39.939]  Uh, study wrong impression to help support Iraq war.
[01:56:43.355 --> 01:56:47.218]  This is admitted stuff, by the way.
[01:56:48.538 --> 01:56:49.659]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[01:56:49.679 --> 01:56:51.560]  There's a lot of key stuff in the stack today.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:57:00.385]  Before I end this hour, I want to spend the last 70 seconds or so we got left encouraging every single person out there to support this broadcast by spreading the word about the show.
[01:57:01.397 --> 01:57:01.997]  What do you listen on?
[01:57:02.057 --> 01:57:05.480]  Internet, AM, FM, shortwave, satellite, and to get my videos.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:14.406]  To get them and give them as Christmas presents, or to give them as birthday presents, or just give them as a gift of knowledge to your neighbors, the county commissioner, the sheriff, the talk show host, especially the talk show host.
[01:57:15.007 --> 01:57:16.287]  Don't count on others to do it.
[01:57:16.327 --> 01:57:19.390]  We know it's having a massive effect, but not a big enough effect.
[01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:22.752]  And your purchase also supports what we do here.
[01:57:23.439 --> 01:57:34.902]  So go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, peruse what we have to offer of your own line and support us and get great items that will wake people up and that you'll find riveting and informative, up the level of your understanding.
[01:57:35.442 --> 01:57:40.183]  Police State 3, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, the book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:57:40.683 --> 01:57:41.323]  Get it all!
[01:57:41.343 --> 01:57:41.403]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:49.418 --> 01:57:49.959]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:57:50.079 --> 01:57:56.766]  Or, just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:57:56.846 --> 01:57:59.068]  If you don't stand the gap against tyranny, nobody will.
[01:57:59.088 --> 01:58:01.130]  Get out there, get on the field, get off the bench.
[01:58:12.236 --> 01:58:15.499]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:15.559 --> 01:58:19.703]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:19.983 --> 01:58:22.845]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:29.431]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:37.458 --> 01:58:38.098]  Big Brother.
[01:58:38.759 --> 01:58:39.720]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:40.507 --> 01:58:41.608]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:43.069]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:44.750]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:44.770 --> 01:58:49.033]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.594 --> 01:58:53.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:55.878 --> 01:58:56.959]  Welcome, my friends.
[01:58:57.239 --> 01:59:03.924]  Welcome to another hour of the Alex Jones Show, our third and final hour of this October 16, 2003,
[01:59:06.354 --> 01:59:27.032]  Broadcast attempting, and in many cases being successful, at deprogramming the mass of people worldwide that are able to hear my voice to realize that human history is a long chain of tragedies with corrupt strongmen, king rats, thugs, dominating populations, enslaving humanity.
[01:59:27.452 --> 01:59:31.836]  Now the king rats, the strongmen, have gotten more sophisticated.
[01:59:32.668 --> 01:59:41.336]  They are very adept at convincing you that giving up liberty gives you security, when in reality it gives you the T-word, tyranny, the S-word, slavery.
[01:59:42.808 --> 02:00:04.046]  I mean, we see the 9-1-1 whitewash panel, many of the people on the panel involved in carrying out the cover-up and involvement in 9-11, telling you the answer is unlimited Patriot Act, unlimited new domestic CIA, matrix systems as they call it, total information, total surveillance, end of liberty, total enslavement of the people.
[02:00:05.037 --> 02:00:06.519]  We just point out that's a fraud.
[02:00:06.539 --> 02:00:07.700]  The border's still wide open.
[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:09.482]  The government's involved funding terrorists.
[02:00:09.522 --> 02:00:10.523]  They stand to gain from it.
[02:00:10.763 --> 02:00:18.631]  Not just increasing the size of agencies, but immobilizing America for what they call imperial mobilization to go out and attack sovereign nations worldwide.
[02:00:20.774 --> 02:00:26.600]  Now, the toll-free number to join us on air to talk about any issue your heart desires
[02:00:27.355 --> 02:00:37.078]  If you disagree with me, if you agree, if you have a news item you want to talk about, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:37.098 --> 02:00:37.358]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:38.058 --> 02:00:41.539]  And we'll get to all the callers that are patiently holding and not those that are calling in.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.460]  Coming up here after I cover some more of this news.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:50.242]  I've been disciplining myself to cover the news.
[02:00:52.163 --> 02:00:55.824]  Workers strike over Big Brother monitoring system.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:06.028]  I already talked about how they have now basically suspended the smallpox inoculation program because no one's taking it now.
[02:01:06.248 --> 02:01:07.029]  99.9% plus.
[02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:12.774]  What an example of a victory of educating the people and the population not trusting this illegitimate government.
[02:01:13.755 --> 02:01:15.877]  Workers strike over Big Brother monitoring.
[02:01:15.897 --> 02:01:18.979]  This dovetails nicely because we're all under the same government.
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:24.024]  England, the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the ushering group of countries as I call them.
[02:01:24.582 --> 02:01:27.745]  Workers strike over Big Brother monitoring system from Ananova.
[02:01:28.625 --> 02:01:40.695]  Factory workers are talking strike action, or taking strike action, after bosses introduced the Big Brother-style monitoring system, forcing them to wear red tags on T-brakes.
[02:01:42.276 --> 02:01:53.645]  The 84-strong workforce at a manufacturing company, Teleborg in Lancaster, complained of being treated in a demeaning way over the new ruling that they must wear the tags when they are
[02:01:55.057 --> 02:01:56.798]  From their normal workplace.
[02:01:57.578 --> 02:02:06.681]  Officials from the Transport and General Workers Union say the workers are being treated like naughty school children and are amazed by the company had let the dispute go so far.
[02:02:07.201 --> 02:02:11.643]  Consultation service ACUS has been brought in to help broker a solution.
[02:02:12.783 --> 02:02:19.106]  And I got articles here where people are suing the government in Canada for being forced to biometrically thumb scan and face scan for driver's license.
[02:02:19.466 --> 02:02:21.146]  Talking about a quote control grid.
[02:02:21.507 --> 02:02:22.567]  A system of control.
[02:02:23.658 --> 02:02:24.979]  Why aren't we filing suits here?
[02:02:25.379 --> 02:02:26.500]  Why haven't I filed a suit?
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:28.862]  I went and got arrested protesting back in 97.
[02:02:29.723 --> 02:02:37.149]  Some of the best footage we've got, most dynamic, frankly the favorite footage of all viewers, both the TV show and the films, is from America Destroyed by Design.
[02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:43.374]  But it's good to see people recognizing that we're being tagged and traced like slaves in our workplaces.
[02:02:44.235 --> 02:02:47.818]  There was an ABC News article a few months ago about how they want to make all U.S.
[02:02:47.858 --> 02:02:52.522]  workers in any type of multi-story building wear RFID badges or bracelets or necklaces.
[02:02:53.931 --> 02:02:55.832]  Same thing Iraqis have to do to have a job.
[02:02:56.372 --> 02:03:00.473]  Quote, because if a building gets attacked, then the censors will know if everyone's evacuated.
[02:03:00.513 --> 02:03:01.734]  Why, it'll save lives!
[02:03:02.014 --> 02:03:04.515]  You've all got to wear your badges, your bracelets.
[02:03:05.475 --> 02:03:06.775]  See how far it's going?
[02:03:07.215 --> 02:03:08.756]  And in England, they can recognize it.
[02:03:08.776 --> 02:03:10.076]  We need to be able to recognize it here.
[02:03:10.777 --> 02:03:11.697]  More on that coming up.
[02:03:11.877 --> 02:03:14.198]  China's successful space mission.
[02:03:15.658 --> 02:03:18.419]  A study, wrong impressions help support Iraq war.
[02:03:18.479 --> 02:03:20.400]  Wrong impressions, you mean the lies of the media.
[02:03:21.525 --> 02:03:25.187]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:25.207 --> 02:03:29.330]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:31.091]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:03:31.231 --> 02:03:33.373]  A New World Order.
[02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:49.602]  Can emerge.
[02:03:49.723 --> 02:03:53.948]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:54.008 --> 02:04:00.937]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:04:01.077 --> 02:04:03.120]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.421]  Homeland Security.
[02:04:04.642 --> 02:04:05.423]  Executive orders.
[02:04:05.623 --> 02:04:06.524]  Force vaccinations.
[02:04:06.684 --> 02:04:13.787]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:04:14.067 --> 02:04:19.429]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:04:19.949 --> 02:04:23.710]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:23.870]  That's 888.

[02:04:32.495 --> 02:04:41.663]  Enzyme Phytonutrient, or EPN, is a new all-in-one combination of enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication.
[02:04:42.303 --> 02:04:52.331]  EPN is created using a unique 14-day process resembling human digestion, in which soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners.
[02:04:52.951 --> 02:04:58.658]  Enzymes are complex proteins found in digestive juices causing food to break down at an accelerated rate.
[02:04:59.198 --> 02:05:04.524]  Phytonutrients come from plants which provide important protective substances called phytochemicals.
[02:05:05.024 --> 02:05:08.008]  Saccharides are known to be important in cellular communication.
[02:05:08.568 --> 02:05:11.331]  One tablespoon before each meal is all that is needed.
[02:05:11.751 --> 02:05:24.643]  The diseases EPN may be helpful in relieving are too numerous to mention here, so call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for more information about this exciting new dietary supplement.
[02:05:25.184 --> 02:05:26.785]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:05:32.105 --> 02:05:35.588]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:05:35.848 --> 02:05:39.351]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:05:39.432 --> 02:05:43.375]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:05:43.595 --> 02:05:49.761]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:05:50.181 --> 02:05:58.088]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:05:58.488 --> 02:06:03.832]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:06:03.992 --> 02:06:07.754]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:08.135 --> 02:06:09.976]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:06:10.036 --> 02:06:12.217]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:06:12.457 --> 02:06:17.401]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:06:17.441 --> 02:06:22.984]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:06:23.025 --> 02:06:23.245]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:06:28.288 --> 02:06:35.893]  I was going through, I'm not exaggerating, a stack of papers that would reach the ceiling in this broadcast studio just from the last couple months.
[02:06:54.892 --> 02:06:56.532]  It's after I'm done with a big old stack.
[02:06:56.592 --> 02:06:58.693]  Usually the stack's about 3-4 inches thick every day.
[02:07:00.293 --> 02:07:04.975]  And I'll set it over there and then later put it in the storage box and put it in the storage building.
[02:07:06.215 --> 02:07:09.356]  I was just kind of digging through it and out of the stack fell this article.
[02:07:09.676 --> 02:07:10.656]  I've got to recover this.
[02:07:10.676 --> 02:07:12.577]  You know, I ought to do that every month.
[02:07:12.597 --> 02:07:13.717]  I ought to go through all the news.
[02:07:13.957 --> 02:07:15.998]  The, I don't know, thousands of articles.
[02:07:16.518 --> 02:07:17.338]  No exaggeration.
[02:07:17.778 --> 02:07:19.519]  And just pull like 20 of the worst.
[02:07:19.559 --> 02:07:20.479]  The most out of control.
[02:07:21.856 --> 02:07:29.342]  And maybe just have a section on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com of the most overt Big Brother type agendas.
[02:07:30.546 --> 02:07:38.707]  You know, I just read that Atlanta Journal Constitution article about the matrix system of the states, and the NSA, and the CIA, and all your personal data, what you buy, what you read.
[02:07:39.127 --> 02:07:40.868]  And they're trying to announce all this to scare you.
[02:07:40.888 --> 02:07:41.668]  It's a chilling effect.
[02:07:42.088 --> 02:07:46.489]  They'll never have the personnel to go after all of you, or do really anything to you.
[02:07:46.889 --> 02:07:52.990]  They can kill a few big fish like myself, time to time, to scare the menace off, but it isn't going to work anymore, and they know that.
[02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:55.010]  We're committed, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:55.950]  I'm committed.
[02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:59.811]  Smart cars, smart roads, can help drivers.
[02:08:00.871 --> 02:08:08.635]  And I got this whole stack of news, I'm going to go to it in a minute and then I'll get to these loaded phones, but... Smart cars, smart roads can help drivers.
[02:08:09.775 --> 02:08:12.376]  And that's the Associated Press by Leslie Miller.
[02:08:13.497 --> 02:08:17.619]  Federal highway officials think they've found a way to prevent thousands of traffic accidents every year.
[02:08:18.179 --> 02:08:22.701]  Smart intersections that warn drivers they're about to run a red light or smash into a truck.
[02:08:25.482 --> 02:08:29.684]  And it goes into saying that, oh, actually we're going to take control of cars as they go down the interstate.
[02:08:31.457 --> 02:08:34.419]  Remember in Minority Report where they retina scan you walking down the street?
[02:08:34.599 --> 02:08:35.219]  Already happening.
[02:08:36.239 --> 02:08:36.940]  Face scanning you.
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:41.422]  Remember how your guilt gyms will prove innocent?
[02:08:42.082 --> 02:08:44.103]  They take control of your cars when you're on the road.
[02:08:46.445 --> 02:08:47.485]  For your safety, of course.
[02:08:47.505 --> 02:08:52.328]  Well, I've read the federal plans for years of them to do this, but it was never in the news.
[02:08:52.348 --> 02:08:58.851]  It's like they set it up, they prepare it, they fund it for four or five, ten years sometimes, and then suddenly they announce it.
[02:08:59.628 --> 02:09:05.912]  Government drivers demonstrated Tuesday, the nation's first test intersection, just what the intersection of the future will be able to do.
[02:09:06.813 --> 02:09:09.334]  A car speeds towards the intersection about to collide with a van.
[02:09:09.715 --> 02:09:19.221]  Sensors spot the car as it approaches the red light and emit a signal to the car, which triggers a high-pitched beep and a red light on the dashboard that says, emphatically, stop.
[02:09:19.521 --> 02:09:24.044]  And then since, I saw this article a few months ago, parents are buying this for their teenagers.
[02:09:25.334 --> 02:09:51.992]  uh... and uh... it's into the GPS and warns you and shouts at you when you drive too fast the steering wheel vibrates and and it creates a report for your parents off the black boxes put in all the cars by accident they say six years ago but just so happen to plug into the satellite interfaces they sell it to you as a status symbol have an info babe say it's great you'll go out and do it much testing remains to be done and drivers probably won't see smart intersections for another five years oh
[02:09:53.553 --> 02:10:03.738]  The newly paved intersection of the administration's highway research center includes traffic signals and advanced traffic control system and two roads from nowhere converging in the middle of the agency's office campus in Washington suburb.
[02:10:05.459 --> 02:10:12.742]  And, uh, and it just goes on in here to describe how, well, we're going to take control and drive your car and it's good for you.
[02:10:12.762 --> 02:10:17.685]  So, I mean, that's just the type of stuff that's just everywhere.
[02:10:17.745 --> 02:10:19.085]  You couldn't spend enough time on it.
[02:10:20.066 --> 02:10:22.707]  But the good news is people are waking up to it and resisting it now.
[02:10:24.896 --> 02:10:30.541]  Continuing with the news here, China outlines plans for future space missions.
[02:10:32.843 --> 02:10:50.318]  Flushed from the victory of having successfully completed its first manned space mission, something the Russians did in the late 50s, China is outlining plans for its future space ambition, officials Thursday announced at eventual space station in the works.
[02:10:51.078 --> 02:11:04.825]  The announcement came only a few hours after Shenzhou-5 capsule touched down in China's inner Mongolian region for its lone crew member, Takonaut Yang Liwei, safely aboard.
[02:11:05.286 --> 02:11:14.991]  The mission took Colonel Yang around the Earth 14 times, just over 20 hours, placing China third behind the United States and the former Soviet Union as the only nations to have put a man in orbit.
[02:11:15.652 --> 02:11:19.674]  Showing new confidence following the success of the much-anticipated mission.
[02:11:19.714 --> 02:11:31.301]  Leaders of China's space program on Thursday told reporters that the manned launch was a first step towards the next goal of carrying out a spacewalk and developing docking procedures.
[02:11:31.341 --> 02:11:34.223]  And then, of course, they've also set a moon mission they don't add here.
[02:11:36.524 --> 02:11:39.526]  Now, I heard a lot of people saying they got this technology from Russia.
[02:11:40.366 --> 02:11:40.947]  And it's true.
[02:11:41.007 --> 02:11:42.968]  Their Long March is a Russian design.
[02:11:43.939 --> 02:12:00.462]  But the separation rings, the how to fuel it, MIRV technology, so the warhead for nuclear attacks can carry dozens of warheads instead of one, was given to them all by Lorall and Hughes, and Bill Clinton allowed the transfer, Republican leaders made the money and sold the weapons.
[02:12:01.483 --> 02:12:04.023]  But again, that's always conveniently left out when they're attacking Bill Clinton.
[02:12:04.303 --> 02:12:10.044]  Yeah, attack Bill Clinton, but let's arrest him for his crimes, and let's stop blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[02:12:10.504 --> 02:12:13.145]  So when you hear a neocon talking about Clinton, tell him to shut up.
[02:12:15.081 --> 02:12:15.521]  Study!
[02:12:15.922 --> 02:12:18.383]  Wrong Impressions Help Support Iraq War.
[02:12:19.523 --> 02:12:20.444]  Miami Herald.
[02:12:20.464 --> 02:12:29.449]  A majority of Americans have held at least one of the three mistaken impressions about the U.S.-led war in Iraq, according to a new study released today.
[02:12:29.929 --> 02:12:34.091]  And those misrepresentations contributed to much of the popular support for the war.
[02:12:34.491 --> 02:12:38.874]  The three common mistakes impressions are that the media is a bunch of liars and told them these lies.
[02:12:39.194 --> 02:12:40.174]  But again, they don't say that.
[02:12:41.075 --> 02:12:41.175]  U.S.
[02:12:41.195 --> 02:12:43.196]  forces found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:48.001]  There's clear evidence that Iraq President Saddam Hussein worked closely with September 11 terrorists.
[02:12:48.501 --> 02:12:54.783]  People in foreign countries generally either back the U.S.-led war or are evenly split between supporting and opposing it.
[02:12:56.323 --> 02:12:58.023]  Getting it wrong on the Iraq War.
[02:12:58.523 --> 02:13:02.484]  Polls show many Americans have misrepresentations about key facts of the Iraq War.
[02:13:02.564 --> 02:13:05.105]  Primarily news sources for those who believe.
[02:13:06.503 --> 02:13:09.224]  And since the war ended, the U.S.
[02:13:09.244 --> 02:13:11.245]  has found Iraq weapons of mass destruction.
[02:13:11.325 --> 02:13:11.645]  Fox, 33%.
[02:13:11.885 --> 02:13:12.025]  CBS, 23%.
[02:13:12.065 --> 02:13:12.145]  NBC, 20%.
[02:13:12.185 --> 02:13:12.365]  CNN, 20%.
[02:13:12.786 --> 02:13:13.026]  ABC, 90%.
[02:13:13.066 --> 02:13:13.366]  Print Media, 11%.
[02:13:13.406 --> 02:13:13.626]  PBS, NPR, 17%.
[02:13:13.666 --> 02:13:13.866]  The U.S.
[02:13:13.886 --> 02:13:17.047]  has found clear evidence that Saddam Hussein has worked closely with the Al Qaeda terrorist group.
[02:13:27.077 --> 02:13:29.418]  Okay, that's where people got their media was the last numbers.
[02:13:29.458 --> 02:13:33.500]  Here's where people polled by these news agencies what they had to say.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.041]  Fox, 67% believe all those lies.
[02:13:37.601 --> 02:13:38.121]  CBS, 56%.
[02:13:38.162 --> 02:13:38.262]  NBC, 49%.
[02:13:38.302 --> 02:13:38.382]  CNN, 48%.
[02:13:38.422 --> 02:13:38.602]  ABC, 45%.
[02:13:38.642 --> 02:13:38.942]  Print, 40%.
[02:13:39.082 --> 02:13:40.002]  PBS, NPR, 16%.
[02:13:40.242 --> 02:13:44.964]  And the source is the PIPA Knowledge Networks poll of 3,334 adults.
[02:13:44.984 --> 02:13:48.386]  June, September 2003 with a 1.7 error margin graphic.
[02:13:57.398 --> 02:13:58.679]  Judy Trebly.
[02:14:00.741 --> 02:14:14.431]  Over 60% of Americans held at least one of the views in polls reported between January and September by the Program on International Policy Attitudes based at the University of Maryland in College Park and the polling firm Knowledge Networks based in Manila Park, California.
[02:14:16.492 --> 02:14:25.239]  Folks, I still hear them on the air, the neocons, saying that they found mobile weapons trucks and mass graves and that Niger really tried to sell uranium.
[02:14:25.259 --> 02:14:26.720]  I mean, they just keep reapplying it.
[02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:34.355]  And again, folks, they would have found the weapons of mass destruction if they wanted to.
[02:14:34.375 --> 02:14:35.035]  They could plant them.
[02:14:35.395 --> 02:14:37.257]  And yes, I said they once, Saddam had them.
[02:14:38.858 --> 02:14:39.739]  So does everybody else.
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:46.485]  But they're not allowed to bring the weapons forward because it's meant to make the UN and the EU look like the good cops.
[02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.766]  And I said this before the war.
[02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:49.748]  I'm not that smart.
[02:14:49.788 --> 02:14:50.969]  You can figure this out, too.
[02:14:51.289 --> 02:14:52.310]  I've seen them do it so much.
[02:14:52.690 --> 02:14:54.692]  The same media that lied to you
[02:14:55.484 --> 02:14:59.488]  And I read Miami Herald articles that are putting out this poll that lied about this stuff.
[02:14:59.628 --> 02:15:00.869]  I read them all over the place.
[02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:07.815]  Then later they'll come back and admit lies and blame it on somebody else to make their credibility look good.
[02:15:08.195 --> 02:15:09.256]  This is a tactic.
[02:15:09.336 --> 02:15:10.277]  Be aware of it.
[02:15:10.798 --> 02:15:13.540]  A psychological warfare putsch.
[02:15:14.961 --> 02:15:17.664]  ABC News, one of the chief perpetrators, has another article.
[02:15:18.673 --> 02:15:18.793]  U.S.
[02:15:18.853 --> 02:15:20.495]  troops suffering low morale.
[02:15:20.835 --> 02:15:22.136]  Well, I don't go with ABC.
[02:15:22.617 --> 02:15:24.298]  I go down and talk to the National Guard.
[02:15:24.358 --> 02:15:27.641]  My friends go down and interview them at Camp Mabry when they're getting back here in Austin.
[02:15:28.622 --> 02:15:29.823]  We got bases all around us.
[02:15:29.863 --> 02:15:31.365]  I talk to them in stores and shops.
[02:15:32.486 --> 02:15:34.748]  I talked to troops when I was in California last week.
[02:15:36.349 --> 02:15:42.895]  It has to be 90% of them I talk to are against the war, know there's a new world order, know they're being told they're getting ready for domestic takeover.
[02:15:44.076 --> 02:15:45.878]  And I did my own poll on the ground in California.
[02:15:46.498 --> 02:15:48.059]  80% of those I talked to love Arnold.
[02:15:48.099 --> 02:15:49.240]  The guy really won, folks.
[02:15:50.241 --> 02:15:51.362]  So I did my own little poll.
[02:15:51.422 --> 02:15:52.703]  I did my own poll on radio.
[02:15:53.624 --> 02:15:54.885]  On 1,000 plus interviews.
[02:15:55.966 --> 02:16:06.314]  And it's gotta be about, I don't know, 90 plus percent of the people that call into the shows totally agree with what we're saying about the New World Order carrying out 9-11.
[02:16:06.595 --> 02:16:08.056]  So there's another real poll for you.
[02:16:09.197 --> 02:16:11.699]  Iran promises to clarify nuclear program
[02:16:12.899 --> 02:16:16.260]  Iran has promised it will address international concerns about its nuclear program.
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:17.881]  The Islamic Republic's ambassador to the U.N.
[02:16:17.901 --> 02:16:29.984]  Atomic Energy Agency, Ali Akbar Salihni, said Thursday that both Iran and the United Nations are completely satisfied with current talks.
[02:16:30.024 --> 02:16:32.645]  He said that significant developments will take place in the near future.
[02:16:34.946 --> 02:16:38.627]  Nuclear talks stalled as North Korea hints
[02:16:39.494 --> 02:16:40.715]  Hits out at U.S.
[02:16:40.755 --> 02:16:41.215]  and Japan.
[02:16:41.275 --> 02:16:41.975]  Hits out at U.S.
[02:16:42.015 --> 02:16:42.415]  and Japan.
[02:16:42.475 --> 02:16:43.536]  ABC News, Australia.
[02:16:44.976 --> 02:16:47.797]  High-level talks between North and South Korea have broken down.
[02:16:47.817 --> 02:16:50.518]  North Korean capital criticized Japan and the United States.
[02:16:50.959 --> 02:17:00.663]  One of North Korea's official newspapers says there is no way the Communist country can freeze its nuclear program while the United States continues what the media outlet calls a hostile policy.
[02:17:00.683 --> 02:17:08.946]  And they now have Taepung Dong-2s, thanks to Clinton and Bush and his crime partners, that can hit anywhere in the continental United States.
[02:17:11.428 --> 02:17:28.056]  Now when we get back, I'll read this article and then I'll go to Robert and Adolf Angus and others that are patiently holding.
[02:17:28.096 --> 02:17:29.256]  If you want to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.

[02:17:35.921 --> 02:17:38.101]  You don't know what you're missing if you want to be truly informed.
[02:17:38.601 --> 02:17:41.762]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:42.882 --> 02:17:44.062]  I have articles here where the U.S.
[02:17:44.082 --> 02:17:47.703]  military was caught poisoning water supplies over the last 12 years.
[02:17:48.483 --> 02:17:49.963]  And the London Independent reports U.S.
[02:17:49.983 --> 02:17:51.844]  soldiers bulldoze farmers' crops.
[02:17:52.804 --> 02:17:57.285]  Americans accused of brutal punishment tactics against villagers while British are condemned as too soft.
[02:17:58.245 --> 02:17:59.425]  They got to put apart a good cop.
[02:18:00.547 --> 02:18:06.049]  And it's admitted that they're bulldozing the date palms and the tangerine fields and the olive groves.
[02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:08.510]  But they say it's a good thing.
[02:18:08.530 --> 02:18:10.511]  While they play jazz music, while they do it.
[02:18:11.371 --> 02:18:12.731]  By the way, this will get more troops killed.
[02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:16.293]  This is really stupid, but the globalists like scorched earth.
[02:18:17.213 --> 02:18:19.214]  12 years of siege against the Iraqis isn't enough.
[02:18:20.194 --> 02:18:21.555]  It's obviously going to continue forever.
[02:18:22.215 --> 02:18:24.616]  If the genocide program of 1.5 million isn't enough.
[02:18:25.496 --> 02:18:28.037]  That's coming up too, and they see more blackouts this winter.
[02:18:28.746 --> 02:18:30.147]  We'll talk about that, too, and take calls.
[02:18:30.167 --> 02:18:30.567]  Stay with me.
[02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:44.137]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[02:19:33.126 --> 02:19:34.646]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:19:34.826 --> 02:19:35.947]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:19:36.147 --> 02:19:39.528]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:19:39.648 --> 02:19:40.088]  Phenol.
[02:19:40.388 --> 02:19:47.471]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:19:47.791 --> 02:19:51.912]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:19:52.012 --> 02:19:52.472]  Fragrance?
[02:19:52.832 --> 02:19:57.594]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:57.734 --> 02:20:02.435]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:20:02.655 --> 02:20:05.136]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:20:05.456 --> 02:20:08.857]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[02:21:34.386 --> 02:21:39.388]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:21:39.788 --> 02:21:42.529]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:21:42.989 --> 02:21:45.850]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:53.373]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:21:53.874 --> 02:21:54.774]  That's recovery?
[02:21:55.374 --> 02:22:00.596]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:22:00.996 --> 02:22:02.517]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?

[02:22:39.726 --> 02:22:42.048]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:42.068 --> 02:22:48.071]  All right, Robert and Alan and Angus and others, you guys all be patient.

[02:22:49.412 --> 02:22:51.413]  Let me just go over this article as promised.
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:54.941]  Again, folks, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:22:55.001 --> 02:22:55.581]  I'm your host.
[02:22:55.621 --> 02:22:58.683]  And people, I get emails, why do you say every couple of breaks, you're Alex Jones?
[02:22:58.723 --> 02:23:01.904]  Well, that helps our radio stations that carry us, who get the ratings.
[02:23:01.964 --> 02:23:03.365]  People need to know what they're listening to.
[02:23:03.845 --> 02:23:05.326]  That's why everybody does that in the media.
[02:23:06.086 --> 02:23:08.167]  Remember, you listened to Alex Jones today.
[02:23:08.688 --> 02:23:08.988]  U.S.
[02:23:09.068 --> 02:23:11.729]  soldiers bulldoze farmers' crops.
[02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:19.393]  Americans accused of brutal punishments, tactics against villagers,
[02:23:20.347 --> 02:23:21.268]  And it goes on, U.S.
[02:23:21.688 --> 02:23:39.817]  soldiers driving bulldozers with jazz blaring from loudspeakers have uprooted ancient groves of date palms as well as orange and lemon trees in central Iraq as part of a new policy of collective punishment of farmers who do not give information about guerrillas attacking U.S.
[02:23:39.837 --> 02:23:40.137]  troops.
[02:23:40.737 --> 02:23:42.878]  That's what Stalin and Hitler did.
[02:23:42.898 --> 02:23:45.040]  And the Vietnamese did that too.
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:47.761]  I guess we're good guys, like the commies now.
[02:23:49.119 --> 02:24:01.307]  The stumps of palm trees, some 70 years old, protrude from the brown earth, scoured by the bulldozers beside the road at Dalhaila, a small town 50 miles north of Baghdad.
[02:24:01.347 --> 02:24:10.092]  Local women were yesterday busily bundling together the branches of the uprooted orange and lemon trees and carrying them back to their homes for firewood.
[02:24:11.033 --> 02:24:12.334]  Nasif Jassim,
[02:24:13.101 --> 02:24:20.126]  One of 32 farmers who saw their fruit trees destroyed said, they told us that the resistance fighters hide in our farms, but this is not true.
[02:24:20.186 --> 02:24:21.447]  They didn't capture anything.
[02:24:22.647 --> 02:24:23.928]  They didn't find any weapons.
[02:24:24.609 --> 02:24:36.717]  Other farmers said the US troops had told them over a loudspeaker in Arabic that the fruit groves were being bulldozed to punish the farmers for not informing on the resistance, which is very active in the Sunni Muslim district.
[02:24:37.395 --> 02:24:40.256]  Well, that isn't going to help you folks, causing all these orphans.
[02:24:40.876 --> 02:24:46.557]  They made a sort of joke against us by, this is a quote, they made a sort of joke against us by playing jazz music.
[02:24:47.197 --> 02:24:48.158]  Oh, like Waco, huh?
[02:24:49.118 --> 02:24:50.638]  Again, this is sick.
[02:24:51.439 --> 02:24:57.340]  And the guy running for president helped run Waco, and the new chairman and joint chiefs of staff was the head general over at there on the scene, General Shoemaker.
[02:24:57.961 --> 02:25:03.126]  They made a sort of joke against us by playing jazz music while they were cutting down the trees, said one man.
[02:25:03.806 --> 02:25:04.587]  Ambushes of U.S.
[02:25:04.607 --> 02:25:12.054]  troops have taken place around the town, but Shaquem Hussein al-Sahal al-Jahari, a member of a delegation that went to the nearby U.S.
[02:25:12.174 --> 02:25:20.322]  base to ask for compensation for the loss of the fruit trees, said American officers described what had happened as a punishment of local people because you know
[02:25:20.982 --> 02:25:30.307]  Who is in the resistance and do not tell us what the Israelis had done by the collective punishment of Palestinians was now happening in Iraq, Sheikh Hussein added.
[02:25:31.267 --> 02:25:34.029]  The destruction of the fruit trees took place
[02:25:34.853 --> 02:25:35.294]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:25:51.590 --> 02:26:15.215]  to the coalition petition address the coalition forces in the town pleading for in erratic English for compensation list only 32 people the pension says tens of poor families depend completely and they do folks on earning their living off these orchards and now they have become very poor and have nothing and are waiting for hunger and death and a million and a half have died since the first cold war folks
[02:26:15.996 --> 02:26:24.758]  The children of one woman who owns some fruit trees lay down in front of a bulldozer, but were dragged away according to eyewitnesses who do not want to be given their names.
[02:26:25.398 --> 02:26:28.658]  They said that one American soldier broke down and cried during the operation.
[02:26:28.939 --> 02:26:36.340]  When a reporter from a newspaper in Iraq today attempted to take a photograph of one of the bulldozers at work, a soldier grabbed his camera and tried to smash it.
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:39.801]  The same paper quotes Lieutenant Colonel Sprinkman of U.S.
[02:26:39.841 --> 02:26:41.301]  Command in the region as saying,
[02:26:42.099 --> 02:26:47.443]  We asked the farmers several times to stop the attacks or to tell us who was responsible, but the farmers didn't tell us.
[02:26:48.044 --> 02:26:50.626]  Oh, you're making a lot of friends, folks.
[02:26:51.306 --> 02:26:52.867]  Informing U.S.
[02:26:52.907 --> 02:27:00.433]  troops about the identity of their attackers would be extremely dangerous to Iraqi villagers, where most people are related and everyone knows each other.
[02:27:00.673 --> 02:27:10.201]  The farmers who lost their fruit trees belong to the Karjai tribe and are unlikely to give information about fellow tribesmen if they are, in fact, attacking U.S.
[02:27:10.241 --> 02:27:10.561]  troops.
[02:27:11.061 --> 02:27:11.622]  Ask how much
[02:27:12.482 --> 02:27:14.043]  Uh, his lost orchard was worth.
[02:27:14.063 --> 02:27:22.128]  Now, seems to him, said it, he was in a distraught voice, it was as if someone caught off my hands and you asked me how much my hands were worth.
[02:27:24.289 --> 02:27:25.850]  Well, that's what the Nazis would do.
[02:27:25.950 --> 02:27:31.694]  If one SS soldier was killed, they'd come in and burn down all the crops and kill some people, which our troops do.
[02:27:32.654 --> 02:27:37.357]  And, uh, then if something else happened, they'd keep it, burn everything and kill half the village, so.
[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:45.522]  I don't know, it hadn't quite gotten to Nazi level, though they admit that in articles, if a woman was walking along, they'd just shoot her and laugh at her.
[02:27:45.943 --> 02:27:53.505]  It's funny to blow a woman into pieces, blast giant high-velocity holes in her, you know, little pin-hole on the other side, or whole shoulders.
[02:27:53.525 --> 02:28:00.528]  I've seen photos, splattered guts everywhere, intestines hanging out of children, troops laughing about it.
[02:28:00.928 --> 02:28:03.989]  Just taking an automatic weapon and just spraying women and children.
[02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:07.731]  There's a splattering bone everywhere and a red spray.
[02:28:08.391 --> 02:28:10.453]  Sorry if that's graphic, but you need to know, folks.
[02:28:11.193 --> 02:28:14.015]  And you need to know it's gonna come back on all of us.
[02:28:14.955 --> 02:28:16.816]  It's gonna come back on America.
[02:28:17.577 --> 02:28:20.018]  And not by the Muslims' hands, my friends.
[02:28:20.198 --> 02:28:21.359]  By the New World Order's hands.
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:24.321]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.821 --> 02:28:26.462]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.362 --> 02:28:30.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:33.556 --> 02:28:37.157]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:28:37.377 --> 02:28:38.798]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:28:39.298 --> 02:28:40.719]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:28:40.999 --> 02:28:46.160]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:28:46.521 --> 02:28:51.002]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:28:51.322 --> 02:29:00.005]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:29:00.486 --> 02:29:01.586]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:29:02.085 --> 02:29:05.846]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:29:06.106 --> 02:29:12.749]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:29:13.069 --> 02:29:17.110]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[02:29:43.306 --> 02:29:43.847]  We listened.
[02:29:44.147 --> 02:29:49.149]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:29:49.409 --> 02:29:49.889]  We listened.
[02:29:50.290 --> 02:29:53.331]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:54.291]  We listened.
[02:29:54.752 --> 02:29:57.773]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[02:29:57.773 --> 02:29:57.913]  I think?

[02:30:35.997 --> 02:30:36.697]  You heard that right.
[02:30:36.797 --> 02:30:39.279]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:30:39.419 --> 02:30:40.359]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:41.920]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:43.701]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:46.723]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:30:46.903 --> 02:30:50.585]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.

[02:31:05.257 --> 02:31:09.682]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than 10 years.

[02:31:28.467 --> 02:31:30.030]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:31:39.711 --> 02:31:46.095]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip, and the right to arrest.
[02:31:46.515 --> 02:31:49.417]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:31:49.477 --> 02:31:52.699]  I want to thank you for tuning into the show, for caring about this country and humanity.
[02:31:52.719 --> 02:32:01.784]  You know, some will say, well, you don't support the troops, you don't support them cutting down the orange and lemon and dates, and you don't support them.
[02:32:01.864 --> 02:32:05.707]  I mean, we gotta make them Iraqis respect us!
[02:32:07.498 --> 02:32:10.661]  How would you like being bombed off and on for 12 years?
[02:32:12.082 --> 02:32:12.823]  How would you like that?
[02:32:13.323 --> 02:32:23.673]  Madeleine Albright in 1997 was asked on Dateline NBC, there's been over 700,000 children die in Iraq as a direct result of the sanctions.
[02:32:25.174 --> 02:32:28.037]  Is that a good price to pay for security in the Gulf?
[02:32:28.077 --> 02:32:28.718]  And she said, yes.
[02:32:30.199 --> 02:32:30.679]  It's true.
[02:32:30.739 --> 02:32:33.860]  It's happened and it's a good price to pay.
[02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:40.321]  I mean, just imagine the enraged... I mean, that video is shown every week on these Arab TV channels.
[02:32:42.961 --> 02:32:45.102]  And, I mean, that's horrible.
[02:32:45.142 --> 02:32:47.522]  Those children don't deserve that.
[02:32:47.562 --> 02:32:49.483]  Now, was it bad when Hitler killed children?
[02:32:49.803 --> 02:32:50.283]  Yes.
[02:32:51.523 --> 02:32:54.604]  Is it bad when the globalists using America's muscle killed children?
[02:32:55.164 --> 02:32:55.564]  Yes.
[02:32:57.958 --> 02:33:04.082]  Was it bad when we targeted Dresden, which had no military value, a city for protecting people's children that were sent there?
[02:33:05.143 --> 02:33:07.405]  And when we killed at least 500,000 in one night?
[02:33:07.925 --> 02:33:08.526]  Was that wrong?
[02:33:08.626 --> 02:33:09.026]  Yes.
[02:33:11.388 --> 02:33:16.671]  Was nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when the Japanese were already trying to unconditionally surrender, was that wrong?
[02:33:16.811 --> 02:33:17.912]  Two Christian cities?
[02:33:18.452 --> 02:33:18.873]  Yes!
[02:33:19.974 --> 02:33:20.454]  Yes!
[02:33:21.455 --> 02:33:21.875]  Yes!
[02:33:22.155 --> 02:33:23.116]  It's wrong!
[02:33:25.453 --> 02:33:28.354]  Now, a lot of you out there, I guess, you've never been hurt.
[02:33:29.755 --> 02:33:30.815]  Never been in the hospital.
[02:33:30.855 --> 02:33:32.976]  You've never been hit upside the head with a baseball bat.
[02:33:33.476 --> 02:33:34.336]  You've never been in pain.
[02:33:34.356 --> 02:33:36.817]  You've had such little, cush, easy lives.
[02:33:36.837 --> 02:33:38.218]  You don't know what pain is like.
[02:33:38.498 --> 02:33:39.779]  You don't know what loss is like.
[02:33:39.799 --> 02:33:41.199]  A lot of you haven't lived.
[02:33:41.639 --> 02:33:45.041]  And that's why you just don't care about millions of dead people.
[02:33:48.022 --> 02:33:49.042]  You just haven't lived.
[02:33:49.122 --> 02:33:49.862]  I don't understand it.
[02:33:49.902 --> 02:33:53.864]  I don't know how you hear the good old boys going, So what about them Iraqis?
[02:33:55.362 --> 02:33:56.682]  And now the liberation comes.
[02:33:57.663 --> 02:34:01.664]  And to have a job, you gotta wear a Halliburton bracelet with an RFID in it.
[02:34:02.244 --> 02:34:03.184]  Have any job anywhere.
[02:34:04.105 --> 02:34:08.446]  The Associated Press reports they arrest people if they're caught selling anything.
[02:34:08.586 --> 02:34:10.387]  Vegetables, beer, they listed it.
[02:34:11.307 --> 02:34:13.608]  Leather goods without a Halliburton license.
[02:34:15.608 --> 02:34:17.669]  You get $20 a month when you work for Halliburton.
[02:34:17.709 --> 02:34:18.749]  You pay them all your money.
[02:34:21.490 --> 02:34:24.231]  That's what's happening over there right now in Iraq, folks.
[02:34:25.569 --> 02:34:32.472]  And they come into an area and they bulldoze their trees and they say this is punishment while playing jazz music.
[02:34:34.012 --> 02:34:36.814]  Now some of our soldiers, you heard the article, were crying.
[02:34:39.695 --> 02:34:40.795]  Those are the real men.
[02:34:42.456 --> 02:34:44.597]  You don't watch children and poor women.
[02:34:44.617 --> 02:34:55.241]  That's the lowest caste in Iraq is the little people that will own a few acres and desperately tend and love their trees and by hand pick the bugs off.
[02:34:56.078 --> 02:34:57.019]  I've seen film of it.
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:59.661]  That's all they've got in their little huts.
[02:35:00.022 --> 02:35:00.862]  All they have.
[02:35:01.883 --> 02:35:03.124]  You go in there and you bulldoze it up.
[02:35:03.145 --> 02:35:04.466]  That's going to get more of our troops killed.
[02:35:05.046 --> 02:35:06.407]  So number one, it's not good for our troops.
[02:35:06.427 --> 02:35:07.388]  Number two, it's evil.
[02:35:08.089 --> 02:35:08.710]  It's wrong.
[02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:10.451]  Suffer the little children and widows.
[02:35:10.471 --> 02:35:13.334]  And you got a country bombed for 12 years.
[02:35:13.354 --> 02:35:15.816]  Their water supplies, their power supplies, everything bombed.
[02:35:16.236 --> 02:35:17.037]  And it's getting worse.
[02:35:17.097 --> 02:35:17.778]  It's not getting better.
[02:35:19.204 --> 02:35:24.508]  And after our trips are done bulldozing trees, the saviors will come in the next few years, maybe even sooner.
[02:35:24.528 --> 02:35:25.589]  The U.N.
[02:35:25.909 --> 02:35:31.513]  will flap in with trucks of trees and food and medicine and love them.
[02:35:31.533 --> 02:35:37.457]  And the news cameras will show it worldwide and they'll compare it to America as they're already doing.
[02:35:38.898 --> 02:35:41.480]  And we'll sit here playing this part.
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:47.024]  We're about to go to Robert and Adol and Alan and Angus and Kevin and others.
[02:35:48.524 --> 02:35:49.445]  Then I'm going to get to U.S.
[02:35:49.485 --> 02:35:51.726]  House votes to sanctions on Syria.
[02:35:52.226 --> 02:35:53.087]  Israel is happy.
[02:35:53.427 --> 02:35:56.548]  Halliburton overcharging to import gasoline to Iraq due to Democrats' charge.
[02:35:56.568 --> 02:35:57.789]  Well, that's obviously already true.
[02:35:57.809 --> 02:35:59.870]  9-1-1 panel urged to get tougher.
[02:35:59.890 --> 02:36:02.912]  Families call on group to use subpoena power to obtain documents.
[02:36:03.532 --> 02:36:05.593]  Clinton warned Bush of bin Laden threat.
[02:36:06.054 --> 02:36:06.734]  More propaganda.
[02:36:07.374 --> 02:36:10.376]  Space set to become war zone.
[02:36:10.396 --> 02:36:11.917]  9-1-1 panel votes to subpoena FAA.
[02:36:11.937 --> 02:36:13.458]  We'll cover them.
[02:36:13.478 --> 02:36:15.599]  We'll go to these calls quick, but before I do that,
[02:36:17.372 --> 02:36:18.693]  Stop procrastinating, folks.
[02:36:18.753 --> 02:36:23.236]  We have tools that can save America, that can wake people up, that can change minds.
[02:36:23.736 --> 02:36:28.099]  My new films are unlocking the minds of 90% of those that see them.
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:30.980]  Before, it was about 50%.
[02:36:31.781 --> 02:36:39.165]  Now, we're now finding that folks that order my original films, which are just as good, are having 90% wake-up rates.
[02:36:39.266 --> 02:36:42.007]  That's because people have already seen all the pieces of the puzzle.
[02:36:42.027 --> 02:36:46.310]  They know in their gut, in their subconscious, in their soul, that something's wrong.
[02:36:48.385 --> 02:36:50.325]  And so, they're getting upset.
[02:36:50.666 --> 02:36:52.866]  When they see the films, it unlocks everything.
[02:36:52.906 --> 02:36:54.046]  The pieces fall together.
[02:36:54.526 --> 02:36:56.067]  We have a tool to wake people up.
[02:36:58.227 --> 02:36:59.488]  And a listener pointed this out.
[02:37:00.508 --> 02:37:01.888]  I'm no fan of Ayatollah Khomeini.
[02:37:01.908 --> 02:37:03.629]  That's replaced one demon for another demon.
[02:37:04.149 --> 02:37:06.609]  But he used audio cassettes to take over Iran.
[02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:08.310]  This has been done in a lot of countries.
[02:37:08.330 --> 02:37:13.071]  Special Forces will use audio cassettes in third world countries when they're fighting communists, which they don't do now.
[02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:22.311]  Leaflets, pamphlets, is what the founding fathers did for the ten years leading up with the committees of correspondence.
[02:37:23.112 --> 02:37:25.514]  What our rights are, who's violating them, how to stop it.
[02:37:26.334 --> 02:37:27.094]  Get the videos.
[02:37:27.154 --> 02:37:28.795]  Get America Destroyed by Design.
[02:37:29.155 --> 02:37:29.636]  Police State 2000.

[02:37:36.399 --> 02:37:37.800]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:38.420]  Dark Secrets.
[02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:39.781]  Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:37:40.001 --> 02:37:41.281]  My Little $12 Book.

[02:39:10.589 --> 02:39:12.971]  Don't wait, take action today!
[02:39:14.833 --> 02:39:18.116]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Robert in Illinois.
[02:39:18.136 --> 02:39:19.617]  Thanks for holding for 40-something minutes.
[02:39:19.637 --> 02:39:20.157]  You're on the air.
[02:39:20.618 --> 02:39:22.339]  Alex, Robert from Illinois, good to hear your voice.
[02:39:22.399 --> 02:39:26.443]  I'm wondering if I could get about four minutes here because I want to get some administrative issues out of the way.
[02:39:27.163 --> 02:39:34.950]  I was trying to get a hold of you before the Chicago City Council voted 37-7 for a resolution to oppose the Patriot Act.
[02:39:35.290 --> 02:39:37.252]  It wasn't as strong as it should have been, but at least
[02:39:37.892 --> 02:39:42.737]  These idiots, none of them knew that we don't have a Democratic form of government, we have a Constitutional Republic.
[02:39:42.757 --> 02:39:48.402]  If you heard the comments made, you realize how serious the corruption and criminality is in Illinois.
[02:39:48.442 --> 02:39:50.904]  It's a terrible state, but at least they did quash that.
[02:39:50.964 --> 02:39:53.647]  But a couple things I want to get, do you still have the same email address?
[02:39:53.767 --> 02:39:55.548]  AlexJonesAtInfoWars.com, Alex?
[02:39:55.588 --> 02:39:55.969]  Yeah.
[02:39:56.309 --> 02:40:00.393]  Number two, can we still leave a voicemail message for 512-291-5750 that you'll get?
[02:40:03.255 --> 02:40:03.576]  Yes.
[02:40:03.816 --> 02:40:04.377]  Okay, good.
[02:40:04.637 --> 02:40:11.767]  The next thing then, we're copying your tapes and handing them out right and left and some other stuff.
[02:40:11.787 --> 02:40:14.471]  I'm wondering if you've seen this William Still Money Masters?
[02:40:14.731 --> 02:40:20.019]  That is extremely helpful to people because when I explain all this stuff about your tapes and they start to try to take it in,
[02:40:20.679 --> 02:40:35.763]  If they don't have the historical understanding of how the bankers have been behind all this since Rothschild became a goldsmith in 1750 in Frankfurt, Germany, they don't understand what the motive is, and they don't understand the wickedness, and they don't understand the Illuminati and the Satanist element in this.
[02:40:36.103 --> 02:40:45.246]  So to try to give people a longer background, with all your material, we're also trying to get this William Still, the three-hour and ten-minute money masters... Yeah, I've heard the film, probably.
[02:40:46.502 --> 02:40:48.944]  Let's be conservative, 100 times here in Austin.
[02:40:49.424 --> 02:40:50.265]  Okay, Money Masters.
[02:40:50.625 --> 02:40:50.865]  Good.
[02:40:51.125 --> 02:40:54.468]  It had a different name, it changed names two years ago.
[02:40:54.848 --> 02:41:05.316]  Okay, but anyway, that for his listeners, that'll give people a longitudinal understanding of the under-workings of all this stuff, so that now it doesn't seem like this happened seven years ago at First World Trade Center.
[02:41:05.596 --> 02:41:12.681]  The other thing outside this John Kaminsky American autopsy report, I wanted to say touche to all the things... First World Trade Center was ten years ago.
[02:41:13.618 --> 02:41:14.478]  What's that, Alex?
[02:41:14.898 --> 02:41:16.999]  The first World Trade Center attack was set up.
[02:41:17.339 --> 02:41:18.120]  You're right, I'm sorry.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:19.740]  We're already in 2003.
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:21.341]  I was thinking off of the framework of the 2000s.
[02:41:21.481 --> 02:41:22.241]  I'm way behind.
[02:41:22.521 --> 02:41:24.562]  But there's John Kaminsky's American autopsy report.
[02:41:24.602 --> 02:41:27.763]  He's got a real good arrest of the President now, which we're handing out to the people.
[02:41:28.663 --> 02:41:34.765]  The other thing else I wanted to get into specifically was the Chiavo murder down in Tampa.
[02:41:34.926 --> 02:41:38.907]  Yeah, we had the Canadian on who's trying to get her to come to Canada, working with a family.
[02:41:39.347 --> 02:41:40.928]  Okay, because a couple things I was going to pass along.
[02:41:40.968 --> 02:41:45.329]  First of all, Alex, if I'd like to run through the scenario, just get your analysis real quick.
[02:41:45.389 --> 02:41:47.690]  A couple different, there's a lot more that could be done on this.
[02:41:47.910 --> 02:42:04.057]  But first of all, not only in a society of apathetic, selfish cowards could a husband and a group of criminals... Yeah, only in a place where the family's dying and everything's falling apart, and people giggling when they're young about this, or 45 or 50, don't know they're going to end up in that same position, you fools!
[02:42:04.537 --> 02:42:04.957]  Exactly.
[02:42:05.257 --> 02:42:08.220]  Only in a society as corrupt and apathetic and cowardly as ours.
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:11.582]  Only in an instant gratification, live today, tomorrow we die.
[02:42:11.903 --> 02:42:13.444]  Would they think they could get away with this?
[02:42:13.884 --> 02:42:14.905]  But there's a bunch of things else.
[02:42:14.925 --> 02:42:21.150]  I don't know if you know who's running the, right now, Randall Terry, I heard was involved down there, but I'm looking to get a hold of her attorneys.
[02:42:21.210 --> 02:42:24.273]  I'm trying to get a hold of her attorneys because there's a number of different things.
[02:42:24.413 --> 02:42:26.715]  Bush, we have to push Bush's hand.
[02:42:26.995 --> 02:42:28.456]  He's getting off way too easy here.
[02:42:28.516 --> 02:42:34.121]  He made this statement yesterday, which is appalling, that this is a matter for the courts to decide, and at this juncture, if that's the way
[02:42:34.281 --> 02:42:40.083]  Yeah, he can pardon a murderer from a lethal injection, or they have an electric chair sale in Florida.
[02:42:40.423 --> 02:42:45.425]  He can pardon them, but this woman is going to be tortured over a week of having her water taken.
[02:42:45.465 --> 02:42:46.405]  It happened yesterday.
[02:42:46.425 --> 02:42:49.587]  Exactly, and he says that we must respect the process.
[02:42:49.627 --> 02:42:52.108]  That's a gross distortion.
[02:42:52.248 --> 02:42:55.989]  Maybe we should all not drink water for 24 hours and see what it feels like.
[02:42:56.644 --> 02:43:04.229]  The pain is going to be unbelievably excruciating, and Alex, this is what I was getting to, is that people don't realize that we've got to up the ante here.
[02:43:04.509 --> 02:43:19.538]  If they think they have a society of individuals who will never resort to physical force to stop this violence, and this is a state-facilitated murder here, this is not something that we are all accomplices in this murder if we don't prevent this murder.
[02:43:19.799 --> 02:43:21.079]  There's just no two ways about it.
[02:43:21.099 --> 02:43:24.942]  This is like Daniel in chapter 13 of the book of Daniel, where Susanna is going away to her murder.
[02:43:25.302 --> 02:43:27.583]  And he says, hey, I can't have this murder on my conscience.
[02:43:27.643 --> 02:43:29.803]  And then he obviously exposes the false accusers.
[02:43:30.144 --> 02:43:34.025]  But what I was going to say, Alex, is that I want to run this scenario by you real quick here.
[02:43:34.545 --> 02:43:38.386]  Do you know, is that hospice guarded 24 hours a day?
[02:43:38.526 --> 02:43:39.306]  Of course it is.
[02:43:39.586 --> 02:43:40.747]  Okay, it is being guarded.
[02:43:40.787 --> 02:43:42.007]  That's number one.
[02:43:42.227 --> 02:43:42.947]  Let me just say this.
[02:43:43.087 --> 02:43:46.689]  I think people should engage in civil disobedience.
[02:43:46.809 --> 02:43:49.349]  I think people should go there.
[02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:54.291]  And I think the doctors, but the murder is going on inside right now.
[02:43:55.243 --> 02:43:59.604]  And it's a very, very serious issue, and I really appreciate your call.
[02:44:00.444 --> 02:44:01.585]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[02:44:01.945 --> 02:44:03.685]  Let's talk to Allen in Texas, then.
[02:44:04.246 --> 02:44:06.486]  Adol and Angus and Kevin, go ahead.
[02:44:06.506 --> 02:44:07.346]  You're on the air, Allen.
[02:44:07.847 --> 02:44:08.727]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:08.767 --> 02:44:09.887]  It's good to talk with you again.
[02:44:09.907 --> 02:44:12.508]  I've got a couple things going on.
[02:44:12.528 --> 02:44:17.529]  I went down to the Green Festival in Austin this weekend, where Greg Palast talked.
[02:44:18.229 --> 02:44:23.791]  And I left and came home, and I was just so angered, upset at what has happened.
[02:44:24.927 --> 02:44:36.391]  With the hijacking of our government and some of the other bulldozing and murderers burying people alive that went on in Tanzania when Daddy Bush got into the gold business and they wanted those mines down there.
[02:44:36.691 --> 02:44:38.312]  And they put the communists in, yeah.
[02:44:39.332 --> 02:44:49.396]  Yeah, but one thing I was calling about other than that was my wife cuts hair in a local haircutting place for little kids and one of the children that comes in there is autistic.
[02:44:49.416 --> 02:44:52.517]  A little boy, a couple years old.
[02:44:54.170 --> 02:45:07.980]  And she told me that it was the most heartbreaking story that he had been taken in for his DPT shots and he was a perfectly healthy, active, brilliant little boy, toddler, just learning to talk.
[02:45:08.841 --> 02:45:15.305]  Ten days after the shots, he stopped talking and since then has been autistic.
[02:45:15.325 --> 02:45:18.748]  And when I thought of my three-year-old daughter and I thought, that is
[02:45:19.745 --> 02:45:20.906]  I mean, that would destroy me.
[02:45:20.926 --> 02:45:23.027]  Sir, it's up by over 2,000 percent.
[02:45:23.067 --> 02:45:24.128]  It's worse than death.
[02:45:24.308 --> 02:45:25.969]  Autism's up by 2,000 percent.
[02:45:26.009 --> 02:45:27.630]  They have directly linked it to what's in it.
[02:45:28.310 --> 02:45:31.873]  Most children just get an IQ reduction when it overburns them.
[02:45:32.393 --> 02:45:35.055]  It causes an autoimmune response in the cerebral cortex.
[02:45:35.355 --> 02:45:41.819]  When the IQ reduction has a bad reaction, you get the massive brain damage.
[02:45:41.999 --> 02:45:46.862]  What floored me, Alex, was my wife asked the mother, she said, and this was here in Austin,
[02:45:47.509 --> 02:45:49.254]  She said, what can you do about that?
[02:45:49.315 --> 02:45:50.258]  And her mother said, well...
[02:45:50.902 --> 02:45:57.367]  We wanted to sue the drug companies, but there's been a stipulation included in the Homeland Security Act.
[02:45:57.387 --> 02:45:58.428]  Yeah, but that was repealed.
[02:45:58.488 --> 02:45:59.789]  The lawyers are telling her that.
[02:45:59.829 --> 02:46:00.489]  That's not true.
[02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:09.096]  Bush had it passed that the big company that was involved in that, they had vaccine liability protection.
[02:46:09.116 --> 02:46:10.017]  That's now been stripped.
[02:46:10.317 --> 02:46:10.577]  Good.
[02:46:11.098 --> 02:46:11.598]  Wonderful.
[02:46:11.938 --> 02:46:12.719]  So glad to hear it.
[02:46:12.759 --> 02:46:20.645]  And I also wanted to add that for everyone out there, I mean, after this last weekend and on top of everything else, I have dedicated all of my time
[02:46:21.215 --> 02:46:27.280]  My life, my work, and my money is going to get these monsters out of position.
[02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:28.061]  They're monsters.
[02:46:28.261 --> 02:46:28.542]  They are.
[02:46:28.562 --> 02:46:28.902]  They're monsters.
[02:46:28.982 --> 02:46:29.603]  They are monsters.
[02:46:29.623 --> 02:46:32.785]  And sir, now that the curtains pulled back, you see what I'm talking about.
[02:46:33.066 --> 02:46:34.367]  Now do you know why I'm so upset?
[02:46:34.467 --> 02:46:43.555]  I know exactly, and I'm willing to... I mean, my life is on the line, and I'm going to put it there, and I'm going to keep it there, and everything I have is going... I don't care if it takes a bullhorn and flyers on the streets.
[02:46:44.113 --> 02:46:49.498]  Contributions to radio programs, making radio programs, passing out tapes, everything that it takes.
[02:46:49.718 --> 02:46:52.541]  Well, I would tell you, you sound like an intelligent, dynamic person.
[02:46:52.881 --> 02:46:54.883]  I wouldn't go get co-opted by some little group.
[02:46:55.263 --> 02:47:01.209]  I would start your own organization, get a webmaster, put up your own website, buy time on local radio.
[02:47:01.229 --> 02:47:02.029]  It's happening, Alex.
[02:47:02.470 --> 02:47:05.753]  You need to, yeah, and you need to get involved yourself.
[02:47:06.073 --> 02:47:06.614]  It's happening.
[02:47:07.375 --> 02:47:10.939]  Like I said, I'm going all the way and I'm going to take it all the way out there.
[02:47:11.219 --> 02:47:17.106]  If you really want to do something, you ought to get my videos and make 50 copies of each of them and get them out to opinion makers.
[02:47:17.126 --> 02:47:17.527]  That's right.
[02:47:17.547 --> 02:47:23.734]  And speaking of passing things around, the last talk that he gave was about a little 40-minute deal on cassette tape.
[02:47:23.754 --> 02:47:25.096]  Were you able to get a hold of that?
[02:47:26.478 --> 02:47:27.579]  Well, I've had Paolo Stone.
[02:47:27.619 --> 02:47:37.005]  We've got a bunch of interviews that I guarantee are more hardcore than what he's putting on himself on this show, and that's in the interview section of InfoWars and Prison Planet in the audio section.
[02:47:56.713 --> 02:47:57.834]  Sir, I really appreciate it.
[02:47:57.874 --> 02:47:58.714]  Call back anytime.
[02:47:58.754 --> 02:47:59.575]  Great, great points.
[02:48:00.636 --> 02:48:02.157]  Abdul in Texas, go ahead.
[02:48:02.757 --> 02:48:03.738]  Yes.
[02:48:03.778 --> 02:48:05.999]  Thank you, Alex, for allowing me to be on your show.
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:19.108]  And what I wanted to say is that last week I received a surprise visit from Lieutenant Ron Nauman and Chris Sanchez and Robert Pachfee of the Secret Service.
[02:48:20.829 --> 02:48:24.331]  And Lieutenant Ron Nauman is actually from the Fayette County Sheriff's Department.
[02:48:26.508 --> 02:48:30.690]  Anyway, they came in, and they asked me, first of all, if I was Williams.
[02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:35.672]  I said, no, I'm not Williams, so I expected them to go and find out wherever Williams lived.
[02:48:36.853 --> 02:48:37.653]  That's not what they did.
[02:48:39.334 --> 02:48:43.355]  Then they started to claim that I might be a threat to the life of President Bush.
[02:48:44.256 --> 02:48:44.856]  So what is this?
[02:48:46.377 --> 02:48:49.338]  And they continued to ask me, you know, do you believe in the Old and New Testaments?
[02:48:49.378 --> 02:48:50.579]  Do you believe in prophecy?
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:54.000]  And I answered their question.
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:55.161]  Let me stop you.
[02:48:55.181 --> 02:48:55.821]  I'll hold you over.
[02:48:56.733 --> 02:49:16.539]  In the News and Focus section of InfoWars.com, we have an article from the mainstream news where a guy was at a coffee shop, was seen reading an article called Weapons of Mass Distraction, a mainstream news story, talked about media lies, and he received a vicious visit from the Secret Service.
[02:49:17.019 --> 02:49:19.280]  This is about creating a chilling effect, scaring people.
[02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:25.602]  They only do it to a few hundred people, but then it's meant to be in the news, you're meant to call into shows, to scare everybody.
[02:49:26.594 --> 02:49:27.534]  And it's a chilling effect.
[02:49:27.894 --> 02:49:29.715]  Stay there, we'll talk to you on the other side.
[02:49:30.435 --> 02:49:32.136]  Are you one of them evil Christians?
[02:49:34.056 --> 02:49:36.997]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:49:37.677 --> 02:49:38.957]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:49:39.158 --> 02:49:44.899]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:49:45.179 --> 02:49:50.441]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:50.721 --> 02:49:54.822]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:55.162 --> 02:49:58.843]  Tonight, Marish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:59.083 --> 02:50:03.725]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:50:03.805 --> 02:50:10.067]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:50:10.107 --> 02:50:11.948]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:50:28.454 --> 02:50:29.974]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:30.154 --> 02:50:32.215]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:50:33.064 --> 02:50:39.328]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:50:39.448 --> 02:50:45.591]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:50:45.892 --> 02:50:54.337]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:54.577 --> 02:51:01.581]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:51:01.901 --> 02:51:06.723]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:51:06.923 --> 02:51:12.346]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:51:12.686 --> 02:51:15.767]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:51:16.087 --> 02:51:24.011]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:51:24.091 --> 02:51:24.651]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:51:33.032 --> 02:51:37.739]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:51:38.239 --> 02:51:41.364]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[02:51:48.461 --> 02:51:52.083]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:51:52.523 --> 02:51:55.225]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:51:55.625 --> 02:51:59.427]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:51:59.888 --> 02:52:03.830]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:52:04.372 --> 02:52:07.674]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[02:52:08.014 --> 02:52:13.557]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNLive.com and click on the GCN Mall.

[02:52:40.939 --> 02:52:41.820]  All right, I gotta go quick.
[02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.581]  I've got three callers I want to finish up with.
[02:52:43.921 --> 02:52:45.001]  I can't get to the final news.
[02:52:45.022 --> 02:52:46.142]  I got to most of it today, though.
[02:52:46.182 --> 02:52:46.783]  Pretty good job.
[02:52:48.263 --> 02:52:49.264]  A doll in Texas.
[02:52:49.924 --> 02:52:52.906]  Adele, you got a visit from the Secret Service.
[02:52:52.966 --> 02:52:57.689]  Real quick, encapsulate it, and maybe I'll have you on as a guest or something when I find out more.
[02:52:57.729 --> 02:52:58.590]  But what happened to you?
[02:52:59.270 --> 02:53:03.293]  Well, of course they didn't take me out, but they seemed to create a file on me.
[02:53:04.233 --> 02:53:07.155]  And they kept on asking me questions over and over again, such as,
[02:53:07.734 --> 02:53:09.235]  Have I had recently a surgery?
[02:53:09.555 --> 02:53:10.856]  Do I see a psychiatrist?
[02:53:11.297 --> 02:53:13.959]  Want me to sign over their medical files to them?
[02:53:14.679 --> 02:53:16.901]  Did you ask them why you're here?
[02:53:17.041 --> 02:53:18.522]  What have I done?
[02:53:19.063 --> 02:53:24.687]  Well, what they did is they showed me a letter that I had written to Bill Bennett opposing the war in May 2003.
[02:53:26.728 --> 02:53:27.849]  And what did your letter say?
[02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:36.396]  Well, my letter asked William Bennett, for one, you know, why, if he opposes moral relativism, why does he support George Bush?
[02:53:38.569 --> 02:53:41.451]  Well, I'd like a copy of that letter, sir.
[02:53:41.491 --> 02:53:42.571]  This is a big issue.
[02:53:42.972 --> 02:53:48.334]  Because if you didn't say anything threatening and you got a visit, I mean, I'd say William Bennett's a security risk being around the President.
[02:53:48.374 --> 02:53:51.456]  He could be blackmailed by the Communist Chinese or anybody with all the dirt on him.
[02:53:54.898 --> 02:53:55.958]  Nothing is threatening at all.
[02:53:56.118 --> 02:54:01.641]  I made a statement that is, let me set this up, that they claimed was kind of threatening.
[02:54:02.401 --> 02:54:05.283]  But it would be the equivalent if, let's say you would go to church,
[02:54:05.959 --> 02:54:06.919]  I don't know what to say.
[02:54:06.939 --> 02:54:08.060]  I appreciate the call.
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:08.840]  Send me more info.
[02:54:09.421 --> 02:54:09.681]  Thank you.
[02:54:09.721 --> 02:54:11.301]  Let's go to Kevin in Texas, then Angus.
[02:54:11.361 --> 02:54:12.162]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:54:12.182 --> 02:54:15.123]  You're on the air.
[02:54:15.143 --> 02:54:15.543]  How you doing?
[02:54:15.563 --> 02:54:15.843]  Pretty good.
[02:54:29.403 --> 02:54:42.727]  Hey, I just want to say to Alan that called a few minutes ago, if you're in Austin, come out to the Sackett Gun Show this weekend and there'll be some like-minded Patriots that you can network with and we can find out what his strengths are and what he might be able to do.
[02:54:43.107 --> 02:54:46.308]  You know, he might best apply his abilities too, but we'd love to have him.
[02:54:47.848 --> 02:54:53.330]  I was listening to you earlier talking about the new traffic smart intersections and whatnot in the cars.
[02:54:54.711 --> 02:55:00.313]  I have a friend here in Austin who works for Dresser Industries, and I believe they're owned by Halliburton.
[02:55:01.273 --> 02:55:04.013]  And this goes back to a rationing system.
[02:55:04.053 --> 02:55:06.794]  My grandparents during World War II said, you know, we were farmers.
[02:55:06.854 --> 02:55:08.415]  We really had it better than other people.
[02:55:08.455 --> 02:55:15.376]  We got a little more gas ration to us, and the people from the city would come out and trade us, you know, ration stamps for food.
[02:55:15.456 --> 02:55:22.638]  But at Dresser Industries here in Austin, two weeks ago, they built commercial fuel pumps for the
[02:55:23.599 --> 02:55:31.965]  Well, about two weeks ago they added a new addition to the motherboard that controls the fuel pumps.
[02:55:32.305 --> 02:55:36.528]  There is now a place to put your vehicle identification number.
[02:55:36.608 --> 02:55:39.850]  You'll have to enter your VIN number before it allows you to pump gas.
[02:55:40.310 --> 02:55:42.472]  Yeah, well that's part of the global tax.
[02:55:42.492 --> 02:55:43.192]  They've announced it.
[02:55:43.473 --> 02:55:45.534]  This is all coming down and they'll call it conservative.
[02:55:46.109 --> 02:55:53.833]  They're putting it in right now, and I just wanted people to be aware that it may not show on the outside of the pump, but underneath, that capability is there now.
[02:55:53.933 --> 02:55:59.675]  So, come January 1st, when we get an OPEC oil, let's see what kind of high-tech rationing system they have for us.
[02:55:59.695 --> 02:56:07.539]  Yeah, well, they're putting in the entire control grid, and then they'll announce it later that, oh, the control grid just happened to be in place, and now we're going to control you.
[02:56:07.899 --> 02:56:08.760]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:10.721]  Angus, where are you calling us from, Angus?
[02:56:13.542 --> 02:56:14.222]  Hello, Angus.
[02:56:14.242 --> 02:56:15.303]  You're on the air, Angus.
[02:56:16.631 --> 02:56:17.011]  All right.
[02:56:17.791 --> 02:56:22.053]  I thought I'd call and give you a little information from this side of the border.
[02:56:22.133 --> 02:56:25.474]  I'm an American in self-imposed exile.
[02:56:25.914 --> 02:56:26.835]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[02:56:27.935 --> 02:56:44.641]  The AFL-CIO up here has an initiative before them that they're trying to get a list of people who make purchases at the different, like Home Depot and Totem and people like that that supply building supplies.
[02:56:45.607 --> 02:56:46.849]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[02:56:46.969 --> 02:56:55.859]  Yeah, any excuse to track and trace everything we do while the border stays wide open and while the globalists fund every terror group imaginable.
[02:57:06.522 --> 02:57:14.490]  For the news we didn't get to in detail, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and spread the word about the broadcast and be your own leader.
[02:57:14.950 --> 02:57:16.392]  Start your own organization.
[02:57:17.052 --> 02:57:21.016]  Get out there and get involved and engage the New World Order in the information war.
[02:57:21.076 --> 02:57:21.757]  Have a great day.
