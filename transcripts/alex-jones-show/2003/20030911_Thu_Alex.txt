[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:00.449]  The 8.
[00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:07.917]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.111]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:17.832]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:19.654]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:21.116]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:22.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:31.706]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:41.224]  All right, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:49.390]  It's September 11, 2003, the two-year anniversary of the military-industrial complex kicking off the next phase of dehumanization.
[00:00:50.411 --> 00:01:01.139]  We do have Congressman Ron Paul joining us to talk about the neoconservatives, the New World Order, PNAC talking about how they needed terrorist attacks to get their New World Order.
[00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.281]  Ron Paul is joining us in this hour.
[00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:14.759]  And then for the rest of the day we're going to have open phones and we're going to talk about September 11th and go over some of the smoking guns, some of the history of it.
[00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:28.904]  George W. Bush yesterday gave a speech in the late morning where he talked about how Bin Laden is sure to strike us again and is still a danger.
[00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:30.565]  There hadn't been a Bin Laden tape out
[00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:39.626]  In 20 months, a new one, suddenly, one hour after Bush spoke, there was a Bin Laden tape on Al Jazeera recorded a few months ago, they say.
[00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:43.287]  And he's going to get us, he's going to strike us any minute.
[00:01:43.327 --> 00:01:45.708]  He was validating everything Bush had to say, of course.
[00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:46.888]  He works for him.
[00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:49.089]  Employee of the CIA.
[00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.930]  It's kind of like right before the war with Iraq, Colin Powell was before Congress.
[00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.072]  He said, right now there's a tape airing on Al Jazeera where Bin Laden says he's with Iraq and he has people there.
[00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:05.527]  So the news all hears that and runs and tunes into Al Jazeera and looks everywhere and there was no such tape.
[00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:12.149]  And they come back and the committee chairman says, Mr. Powell, Secretary of State, there's no such tape airing.
[00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.290]  He said, oh, it will be, and turned kind of a shade of pink.
[00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.211]  Oh, it will be airing, don't you worry.
[00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:25.073]  The Qatar-based CIA front company will have a little buddy on TV immediately for you, Al Jazeera.
[00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:27.544]  So right on time!
[00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:30.847]  George Bush is like a black magic leader.
[00:02:30.887 --> 00:02:32.649]  He could just conjure Bin Laden.
[00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.851]  Conjured the Goldstein creature.
[00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:41.837]  Goldstein is the boogeyman in 1984 that's blamed for everything that Big Brother carries out against the people to keep them in submission.
[00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:51.726]  Big Brother blows stuff up and then blames it on the imaginary boogeyman Goldstein who wears a turban and has a big beard and archetypal Rasputin-type creature.
[00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.270]  By the way, there's a new action figure out.
[00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.351]  It's not just the George Bush action figure.
[00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:57.551]  There's another one out.
[00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:01.613]  And it's the Osama Bin Laden doll.
[00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:07.236]  And it comes free with Cardinal Group funding.
[00:03:08.497 --> 00:03:10.098]  And Patriot Act included.
[00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:11.198]  Loss of Liberty included.
[00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:14.160]  You can go to Infowars.com and look at it.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.060]  It's something else.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.160]  It's going up right now.
[00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.262]  It says, a New World Order boogeyman, Bin Laden.
[00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:26.150]  But is this not extremely transparent?
[00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:35.815]  That Bush gives a speech, Bin Laden's going to get you, the left-wing and right-wing New World Order pundits all say, man, we're going to get hit by something bigger than 9-1-1.
[00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:41.318]  And Bush said, you better pass Patriot Act 2, or Al-Qaeda's going to get you.
[00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:45.260]  And then Al-Qaeda made an appearance, right on time!
[00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:48.702]  Hadn't been seen in, you know, almost two years.
[00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.384]  Well, we saw the fat bin Laden 20 months ago, 19 months ago.
[00:03:52.824 --> 00:04:01.247]  The fat bin Laden in the dark room, but no, an older-looking bin Laden with a gray beard popped up for us on TV, and he's gonna get us.
[00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:05.169]  And Bush said, you better pass my Patriot Act, too.
[00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.010]  You better do it.
[00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.211]  A group of law enforcement and military in front of him, all merging.
[00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.874]  And last night, we were treated to 60 Minutes, too.
[00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:15.415]  I finally watched some television.
[00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:21.077]  I mean, Bush fake crying all about the leader and how he fights Al Qaeda, how great he is.
[00:04:21.097 --> 00:04:23.678]  It's like North Korean television or something.
[00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:28.340]  Not about September 11th, just about the dear leader, the gracious leader.
[00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:34.343]  I mean, folks, we're in a lot of trouble, and they're just kicking this thing off.
[00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:35.503]  A war with North Korea.
[00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:40.085]  They're trying to get North Korea to do something, trying to push them, like the ten-part plan to get Japan to attack us.
[00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:44.537]  And you know, who can say going to war against North Korea is a bad thing?
[00:04:44.557 --> 00:04:47.099]  You know, if we were a good government for the right reasons.
[00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.921]  But no, they'll put something in just as bad once they're in there.
[00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.985]  And it's about the smokescreen of the national draft and the hundreds of thousands of dead U.N.
[00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:56.746]  troops that'll die going into North Korea.
[00:04:57.187 --> 00:04:58.047]  We'll talk about it all.
[00:04:58.207 --> 00:04:59.168]  Ron Paul coming up.
[00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:00.689]  And a lot more.
[00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.051]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.932]  Big show lined up for you.
[00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:07.214]  On September 11th, 2003.
[00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:15.600]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.186]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:24.751]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.133]  The New World Order?
[00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:32.114]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:39.118]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.299]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:52.044]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:55.005]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new tool

[00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.729]  Reason number 10, no one listens to him at home.
[00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.410]  Reason number 9, I don't want to be the only one calling in.
[00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.771]  Reason number 8, think of the rest of the meeting yourself.
[00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.311]  I got a lot of things I gotta do today.
[00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:54.911]  Like get a job and get paid.
[00:06:55.232 --> 00:06:56.432]  I don't understand this guy.
[00:06:57.772 --> 00:07:00.653]  That's all about this with your host, Tony Del Vecchio.

[00:08:17.237 --> 00:08:18.297]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.118]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:21.579]  You want answers?
[00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:23.239]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:27.741]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:32.163]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.773]  All right, folks, it is September 11, 2003.
[00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:47.181]  And two years ago, four jets got hijacked magically.
[00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:48.302]  The bodies were never found.
[00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:50.224]  Most of the supposed hijackers are still alive.
[00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:55.468]  They all have their houses, cars, credit cards paid for by the FBI, a bunch of public officials.
[00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:57.850]  So they were warned not to fly to New York that day.
[00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.972]  San Francisco Chronicle, Times of London reported.
[00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:01.433]  MSNBC's reported.
[00:09:02.513 --> 00:09:04.515]  Insider trading leading back to the CIA.
[00:09:04.616 --> 00:09:04.836]  U.S.
[00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:09.501]  troops massing in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan with launch orders to invade two days before.
[00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:13.485]  Bin Laden, the known CIA asset, meeting with the CIA for 10 days.
[00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:18.851]  8,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda flown out to safety in the middle of the Afghan war.
[00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.653]  Then all opposition crumpled.
[00:09:21.474 --> 00:09:26.159]  And our government took, in a few weeks, what it took the Russians 11 years, 10 years to lose.
[00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:35.608]  Then they flew them out to Pakistan, paid them in gold bars, where they report bin Laden sits today with our supposed allies, the Pakistanis.
[00:09:36.348 --> 00:09:46.518]  He sits there doing television reports about how he's going to kill us, and how George Bush is right, he's behind all the terror, and he works with Saddam.
[00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.286]  I mean, number one, why hasn't Pakistan gone in and gotten him?
[00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:54.808]  That our governments help give nuclear weapons, by the way.
[00:09:55.249 --> 00:10:00.252]  Number two, uh, why did they fly 8,000 of these guys out and drop them off to safety?
[00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:05.235]  Uh, and it, I mean, the listings just go on and on and on and on.
[00:10:05.295 --> 00:10:09.158]  And then just magically, folks, just magically, just magically.
[00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:13.161]  You talk about suspended disbelief, this is a big production.
[00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:16.203]  Like, like, Private Lynch, they admit, was Jerry Bruckheimer.
[00:10:16.952 --> 00:10:18.373]  That was an admitted production.
[00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:22.095]  Jerry Bruckheimer bragged that he helped write the script on that.
[00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:31.960]  That's why it couldn't be the dead Hispanic veteran who really did fight and kill about 15 Iraqis and was shot repeatedly and fought them to the death and they bayoneted him.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.583]  That's why he can't get the awards because he's not a little white girl that America wants to see.
[00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.884]  It's theater, people!
[00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:41.345]  All of it!
[00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:44.487]  It's sickening!
[00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:47.513]  You like the theater.
[00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:54.836]  You like the sappiness as the troops die of vaccines in 1,900 times the safe level of depleted uranium all over Baghdad.
[00:10:55.757 --> 00:10:56.797]  It's real funny.
[00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.960]  I don't want to spin out of control, but Bin Laden aid buried troops.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.961]  Video of Al-Qaeda leader is first in almost two years.
[00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:12.223]  So Bin Laden and his chief lieutenant, al-Zawahiri,
[00:11:13.058 --> 00:11:14.260]  We're good to go.
[00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:32.381]  The tapes were broadcast by Al Jazeera, the CIA front company in Qatar.
[00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:34.362]  I added that CIA front company part.
[00:11:34.683 --> 00:11:40.866]  Satellite TV channel which said the video images were recorded in late April or early May.
[00:11:40.927 --> 00:11:44.769]  There was no information on how the tapes were made or who made them.
[00:11:46.101 --> 00:11:48.983]  So Bush is giving a speech saying, we gotta pass Patriot Act 2.
[00:11:49.263 --> 00:11:50.444]  Bin Laden's still a threat.
[00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:51.525]  He's gonna get ya.
[00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:53.866]  They haven't shown him to us in about a year, you know.
[00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:55.427]  Really, no discussion of Bin Laden.
[00:11:55.447 --> 00:11:58.189]  In fact, the White House even said, quit talking about Bin Laden so much.
[00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:00.650]  And then, magically, Bush says, Bin Laden's back.
[00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.491]  He's gonna get ya.
[00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:02.111]  He even said it.
[00:12:02.331 --> 00:12:04.593]  And all of a sudden, an hour later, I'm gonna get you.
[00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:05.854]  I'm gonna get you.
[00:12:05.954 --> 00:12:07.355]  I'm gonna... I mean, come on!
[00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:16.594]  Again, I'll remind you, right before the Gulf War, earlier this year, do you remember?
[00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.256]  I know you've got long-term memories.
[00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:21.560]  Colin Powell's before the Joint House and Senate Committee.
[00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.783]  He says, we've got to go into Iraq.
[00:12:24.584 --> 00:12:30.672]  I've even been live and saying on Al Jazeera TV right now that we are being, that we are
[00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:40.731]  You know, gotta go into Iraq because he's on TV right now saying that Al-Qaeda is working with Saddam in Iraq right now.
[00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:41.832]  And see, there's our proof!
[00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:42.672]  Bin Laden!
[00:12:42.692 --> 00:12:45.695]  Yeah, Bin Laden giving you just what you need, as usual.
[00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:50.299]  And so they ran around, the reporters ran around, wow, the Secretary of State's saying it's on Al Jazeera.
[00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:50.919]  Well, where is it?
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.860]  They call Al Jazeera.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.702]  Al Jazeera says, we've got no such tape.
[00:12:53.722 --> 00:12:55.183]  What is he talking about?
[00:12:55.203 --> 00:12:57.585]  All of a sudden they go, oh, it just was delivered!
[00:12:58.419 --> 00:13:03.260]  They walk back in an hour later during his testimony and go, Secretary of State, we just got the tapes now airing.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.800]  How did you know?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.941]  He goes, uh, well, you know, and before that he was telling them, well, if it hadn't aired, it will be airing soon.
[00:13:13.382 --> 00:13:15.162]  I mean, it's just blatant stuff.
[00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:22.083]  It'd be like if I told, you know, called the police and I said, you know that dead body you found out there in the back?
[00:13:22.123 --> 00:13:23.143]  Well, I know who did it.
[00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:26.984]  You know, that, you know, that dead body out behind the old whatever.
[00:13:27.802 --> 00:13:29.663]  And the cops went, well, what do you mean dead body?
[00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:31.344]  And then they went and dug it up and it was there.
[00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:34.066]  And I said, oh, well, I thought you dug it up.
[00:13:34.986 --> 00:13:36.267]  They'd be asking me, well, how'd you?
[00:13:36.287 --> 00:13:37.968]  But no, not in America.
[00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:40.949]  It goes out on national TV and we just go, duh?
[00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.030]  Duh?
[00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:48.834]  And that's only one of just thousands of smoking guns and red flags surrounding this.
[00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.435]  They go on and on and on.
[00:13:52.576 --> 00:13:54.557]  It's total theater.
[00:13:55.177 --> 00:13:56.458]  It's not real.
[00:13:59.082 --> 00:14:00.423]  It's a fantasy land.
[00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:06.910]  Bin Laden, admittedly, is the CIS that used to fight the Russians.
[00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:09.153]  They brought the Taliban.
[00:14:09.193 --> 00:14:15.079]  They brought Al Qaeda, or the Foundation, in, in the early 1980s.
[00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:18.402]  There's articles from before 9-1-1 reporting on it.
[00:14:18.442 --> 00:14:20.425]  The BBC and Reuters.
[00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:21.546]  I have them in the films.
[00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:28.833]  And then we got this guy on yesterday and he's saying, well, that's just a separate Arab group with the Saudis.
[00:14:28.893 --> 00:14:34.236]  And I go, well, what about the CIA running the drill on 9-1-1 of flying hijacked jets into buildings?
[00:14:34.296 --> 00:14:37.198]  Well, that is true, but I'll have to look into that some more.
[00:14:37.318 --> 00:14:39.179]  I really can't comment on it.
[00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:48.264]  And of course, New York Daily News, MSNBC, went and checked out the, quote, urban legend that the instant messaging service
[00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:54.372]  Employees were all out of the building, told not to go to work, and they called the instant messaging company, and they said, yeah.
[00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:57.214]  They were told not to go to work four hours before.
[00:14:57.234 --> 00:15:03.357]  They were instant messaged, that's how the company communicates, and told not to go to work that day.
[00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:04.498]  There was a danger.
[00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.280]  They went into all the public schools surrounding it, and little kids said, yeah.
[00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:12.862]  You know, everybody was told not to come to school.
[00:15:12.982 --> 00:15:14.003]  The schools were half empty.
[00:15:14.023 --> 00:15:17.605]  The week before, little kids stood up and said, that building won't be there next week.
[00:15:18.357 --> 00:15:31.682]  There were hundreds of thousands of calendars printed up with a picture of a 747 flying in the World Trade Center and distributed out there by the government, by the globalists to go, oh look, Arabs prior knowledge.
[00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.362]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:15:34.362 --> 00:15:38.864]  They were running a drill that morning, flying jets into New York and D.C.
[00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:39.904]  skyline.
[00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:43.005]  That is admitted!
[00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:44.766]  You ask, why would the government admit that?
[00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:46.845]  Because that's how they can fall back.
[00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:58.509]  You don't think they had all of NORAD and all of the FAA and all of the CIA and all of the vault at Fort Meade sitting around going, ah yes, fly the planes into the buildings, yes, New World Order, ha ha ha!
[00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:01.389]  No, just a few command trucks, folks.
[00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.130]  They got command trucks that can control dozens of drones at one time.
[00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:09.532]  Just a few command trucks right there running the drill that morning.
[00:16:09.892 --> 00:16:10.612]  Stand down!
[00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:11.732]  Stand down!
[00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:14.413]  Just a drill, just a drill.
[00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:17.572]  That's why it stood down, NORAD stood down for over an hour.
[00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:19.172]  That's why jets weren't scrambled.
[00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:26.074]  By the way, it looks like it took longer for the planes to get to their destinations and one of the flights got delayed 20-30 minutes.
[00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:27.595]  Is it 25-30?
[00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:29.975]  We're not sure, but around half an hour.
[00:16:30.736 --> 00:16:33.516]  We know that that's been confirmed, one of the flights there in Boston.
[00:16:34.017 --> 00:16:42.299]  And so that's why Bush had to sit there watching the first building smoke for 15 minutes before he walked out in front of the little kids.
[00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:52.575]  And acted like nothing had happened and sat there and read the little goat story and then Karl Rove walks over and says, Mr. President, another building's been hit.
[00:16:52.895 --> 00:16:59.900]  Mr. President acts all serious and shocked and then goes on reading and then leaves.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.381]  You see, he had to be incommunicado.
[00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:07.164]  He had to be, you know, out there in a place where he couldn't be warned or told.
[00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:10.707]  He had to act like he just learned of it there so he couldn't order.
[00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:15.360]  The planes to carry out procedure, which has been procedure for 50 years in this country.
[00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:19.901]  I mean, it's so incredible.
[00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:26.904]  And then the president and the White House official statement said, we've learned of the first and second plane while he was reading the story.
[00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:28.585]  And that was announced.
[00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:39.109]  And then the principal of the school was at a town hall about it, milking the whole thing and said, well, when I was back there in the office with the president watching it on TV, he was very upset.
[00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:40.130]  He's a wonderful man.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.703]  The reporter said, excuse us, watching TV before he went out?
[00:17:44.783 --> 00:17:46.224]  And he, why yes!
[00:17:47.405 --> 00:17:48.546]  He is a great man!
[00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:51.548]  And so they went to Karl Rove and said, well what happened?
[00:17:51.568 --> 00:17:53.850]  And Karl Rove told the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:17:53.890 --> 00:18:03.336]  He said, well, we were, yeah, we were behind there and we saw, well actually in the limo we heard, in the limo we heard what was going on and he was very concerned.
[00:18:03.477 --> 00:18:06.198]  But wait, you said he learned out there with the little goat story.
[00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:09.301]  Well, let's not discuss that anymore.
[00:18:11.736 --> 00:18:16.959]  It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on for hours!
[00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:26.783]  That's the reality of what happened on September 11th.
[00:18:27.784 --> 00:18:34.567]  And even if the government was loving and good and wouldn't do such a thing despite their official Northwoods plan to carry out just those type of attacks,
[00:18:35.442 --> 00:18:45.808]  Even if they were wonderful and good and totally trustworthy, don't you understand, folks, that they're using it as a pretext to take your liberties, your freedoms, while leaving the border wide open?
[00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:49.030]  I mean, I've got another report here with a bunch of U.S.
[00:18:49.070 --> 00:19:03.799]  attorneys and congressmen and others out of the Scranton Times, Times Shamrock Newspapers, where they are admitting, yeah, we're going to use it for all crimes, drug dealers, misdemeanors, you know, everything.
[00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.407]  They've said it in Congress, it's been in the news.
[00:19:07.488 --> 00:19:14.496]  They're using it to destroy America, secret arrest all this, and they got this line about, these are powers we've had in other cases for a long time.
[00:19:14.817 --> 00:19:15.718]  That's not true!
[00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:25.454]  Yeah, with the Asset Forfeiture, they'll grab an old lady's purse, or grab your ranch, no drugs found, there's been thousands of cases, and they've been caught and had to repeal some of that.
[00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:28.297]  So yeah, they've been doing really bad stuff before.
[00:19:28.317 --> 00:19:32.960]  It's like going, well, we've had black slaves for decades, you know, why get rid of slavery now?
[00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:37.124]  Or, well, Hitler's been putting people in camps for years, you know, what's wrong with it?
[00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.935]  But his statement about administrative subpoenas being no big deal.
[00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:42.536]  They're rubber stamps for whole regions.
[00:19:42.657 --> 00:19:46.540]  But the FBI just secretly arrests you without a warrant, without anything.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.180]  Just does it.
[00:19:50.463 --> 00:19:54.066]  It goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:58.190]  And just the wall-to-wall lying is incredible.
[00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.672]  Ron Paul's coming up and I'm going to come back and hit some more news.
[00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:04.615]  And yeah, we're going to have open phones as well.
[00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:05.376]  It's September 11th.

[00:22:16.912 --> 00:22:19.654]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.

[00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:37.085]  Remember, just over the weekend, Michael Mecher, the energy chieftain over in England, came out and said the PNAC document show, Globalist, allowed September 11th to take place.
[00:24:37.105 --> 00:24:38.045]  It was premeditated.
[00:24:39.091 --> 00:24:49.114]  Project for the American Century, and he quotes them about how they need a Pearl Harbor terrorist attack to launch this global war for empire, an empire that you'll be totally enslaved in.
[00:24:49.134 --> 00:25:07.820]  And we've done a really big update with some of the newest information on September 11th with the archives and just a lot of amazing stuff at InfoWars.com as well as PrisonPlanet.com on this September 11th, so please direct your friends and family to the site, especially so they can read what
[00:25:10.077 --> 00:25:21.906]  What Member of Parliament Metcher had to say about how the globalists are using these terror attacks to get us to accept all of this tyranny.
[00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:29.892]  Then we have all these other reports, too, where ABC ships in more depleted uranium.
[00:25:30.032 --> 00:25:35.056]  Oh, look, we can get hit any minute, see, creating the idea that, of course, nothing will be done at the borders.
[00:25:35.692 --> 00:25:41.634]  You're just going to be searched and controlled internally by the new Commissariat Internal Federal Police.
[00:25:42.235 --> 00:25:43.535]  That, oh, see, we can get hit.
[00:25:43.595 --> 00:25:44.615]  The nukes can get us.
[00:25:44.655 --> 00:25:45.916]  The dirty bombs are going to get us.
[00:25:46.596 --> 00:25:47.497]  Any minute!
[00:25:48.077 --> 00:25:55.900]  They talk about how deadly the dirty bombs are, and how we'll have to evacuate whole cities, and our lives will never be the same, and there won't be any more freedom, but that's okay.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.100]  The government's going to keep us safe.
[00:25:57.841 --> 00:26:04.123]  When they've turned much of Iraq into a dirty bomb, with the thousands of tons of depleted uranium,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.303]  Again, at 1,900 times the safe levels that they've sprayed all over the country.
[00:26:10.824 --> 00:26:17.790]  And remember that Lord Bush says that he needs more police powers versus terror in his speech, and that Bin Laden is still out there and is going to get us.
[00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:24.755]  Like a jack-in-the-box, Bin Laden comes hopping back out, saying that he's going to get us.
[00:26:25.576 --> 00:26:31.701]  It also came out a few weeks ago in MSNBC and other publications that Bush, White House ordered the
[00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:46.669]  Environmental Protection Agency who lie about all the toxic chemicals that came down with the towers and the clouds of asbestos and all sorts of carcinogens and now thousands of Ground Zero rescuer workers are ill.
[00:26:47.889 --> 00:26:59.853]  And what we did on this show is we had a drive to mail breathing gas mask and breathing apparatus to a local church right there at the block from the towers.
[00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:03.072]  Uh, so that you could deliver breathing apparatus.
[00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:09.321]  We didn't say send money to United Way and, uh, Red Cross, which went directly to Handgun Control Incorporated.
[00:27:09.701 --> 00:27:12.385]  We knew what they were doing, day one, because we've watched them in the past.
[00:27:13.104 --> 00:27:18.388]  We said send them breathing apparatus, and some of you did, and so some may not be as ill because of that.
[00:27:18.448 --> 00:27:19.429]  Good job, listeners.
[00:27:19.449 --> 00:27:21.510]  Of course, we did that within a week of the attacks.
[00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:24.513]  Day one, I said it was the government, elements of the government.
[00:27:24.913 --> 00:27:33.179]  I said call the White House in July of 2001, two months before 9-1-1, and I said they're going to use bin Laden to attack New York.
[00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:35.161]  They're going to blame it on bin Laden, their asset.
[00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:37.002]  I wonder who else did that?
[00:27:37.737 --> 00:27:38.557]  How did I know that?
[00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.118]  Because of the threat matrix.
[00:27:40.378 --> 00:27:46.861]  The real threat matrix that I've got in my brain that I unfortunately cannot articulate in its full scope to you.
[00:27:48.281 --> 00:27:54.804]  Let's just say the threat matrix right now is off the charts of the globalist terrorists and what they're getting ready to do.
[00:27:54.884 --> 00:27:57.084]  The smiling, the smirking, the sneaking around.
[00:27:58.245 --> 00:28:03.547]  They've allowed the complaining about the Patriot Act 1 and 2 and Victory Act 1 and 2 to grow to a crescendo.
[00:28:03.927 --> 00:28:06.128]  They're going, hey, we gotta do this to keep you safe.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.223]  You're holding us back from keeping you safe, and they carry out more terror, and say, see, we told you so.
[00:28:12.783 --> 00:28:17.646]  Iran's behind it, Syria's behind it, North Korea's behind it, we've got to go into all these countries.
[00:28:18.286 --> 00:28:30.593]  While we're busy doing that, China says it's going to take Taiwan, and we go into World War III, national draft, compulsory national service, total enslavement.
[00:28:32.214 --> 00:28:36.316]  So that's what we face right now, here in America.
[00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:49.221]  And if we do not cause a revelation, a renaissance of understanding now, which has been taking place, that when you give up liberty, you get tyranny, you don't get security.
[00:28:49.882 --> 00:28:58.933]  And that the government is cynically, with the media, terrorizing the American people, putting in touchscreen election systems that are fraud-based, admittedly.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.922]  Putting in control grids, putting in biometrics.
[00:29:02.302 --> 00:29:11.410]  Reuters and ABC reported that everything's going to be microchip tracked, like the tracker chips that are in your cell phones by GPS off the cell towers.
[00:29:12.276 --> 00:29:18.621]  That to have a job, you're going to have to have an RFID chip that tracks you, quote, so everyone can be evacuated.
[00:29:18.681 --> 00:29:23.645]  And there's going to be infrared scanners in the cars with the police watching you for your safety.
[00:29:24.046 --> 00:29:25.807]  This is all mainstream, folks.
[00:29:26.387 --> 00:29:28.129]  Just untold craziness.
[00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:30.270]  Big Brother on steroids.
[00:29:31.151 --> 00:29:32.712]  Big Brother at warp speed.
[00:29:34.934 --> 00:29:40.279]  Alright, we're going to come back with more news and our guest, of course, Congressman Ron Paul, talking about the neocons.
[00:29:41.661 --> 00:29:43.322]  And his prediction that we're going to have a depression.
[00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:45.423]  And much, much more!
[00:29:46.543 --> 00:29:47.664]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:29:50.285 --> 00:29:53.186]  I hope you call your friends and family and tell them to tune in.
[00:29:54.087 --> 00:29:56.048]  Right now, we'll be right back.
[00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.690]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.811]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:07.353]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.857 --> 00:30:14.760]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.443]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:30:20.703 --> 00:30:23.305]  Ideal for 404 incredible savings!

[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.183]  Alright my friends, we're back live, 33 minutes into the show.
[00:30:46.103 --> 00:30:57.994]  On this September 11, 2003, the two year anniversary, and I'm going to go back over what we've seen develop with our liberties and freedoms in the last two years after we're done talking to Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:05.175]  And Congressman Ron Paul joined us just a few days ago, but we had to cut that interview a little bit short.
[00:31:05.235 --> 00:31:06.677]  Now he is back on with us.
[00:31:07.317 --> 00:31:09.619]  And Congressman, thank you for spending time with us today.
[00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:10.420]  You're welcome.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.060]  Good to be with you.
[00:31:12.021 --> 00:31:23.531]  Congressman, I spoke at a meeting to a crowd that you later addressed a few weeks ago out at McKinney Roughs outside Austin, where your district begins here in Texas.
[00:31:24.672 --> 00:31:27.273]  I had a chance to be there during your speech.
[00:31:27.313 --> 00:31:34.196]  You talked about the neocons, the war on terror, the economy, the depression that's coming because of the financial policies.
[00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:38.137]  I would like to talk about the neocons, your neocons speech.
[00:31:38.177 --> 00:31:39.578]  I'd like to talk about the economy.
[00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:48.662]  I'd like to talk about the different facets of what you, during question and answer, said is a move by people who want global government.
[00:31:50.462 --> 00:31:52.183]  Say that again?
[00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:59.348]  Well, at the end of the speech, you also answered a question by a listener about those that are pushing for global government.
[00:31:59.368 --> 00:32:00.148]  Can you speak to that?
[00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:00.849]  Oh, okay.
[00:32:01.409 --> 00:32:15.677]  Yes, because I think, and it was sort of asked, you know, about the conspiracy and the people who plan, and my answer was that yes, there are people, but I think they're really pretty much out in the open.
[00:32:15.857 --> 00:32:20.360]  The people I run into actually just disagree with me on national sovereignty.
[00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:21.051]  I think?
[00:32:42.873 --> 00:32:49.818]  Many of the people who are the intellectuals and the followers are very sincere people who just think, well, you know, this is different.
[00:32:49.838 --> 00:32:51.760]  This is, uh, the world's different.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.541]  We do need one world government.
[00:32:53.641 --> 00:32:55.142]  We do need these standards.
[00:32:55.202 --> 00:32:59.145]  We need world courts and we need, uh, uh, the United Nations.
[00:32:59.165 --> 00:33:01.447]  I just flat out disagree with them.
[00:33:01.547 --> 00:33:04.890]  I think the smaller units of governments are better.
[00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.471]  And I think the founders were right.
[00:33:06.511 --> 00:33:09.473]  They didn't even nationally, they didn't want a strong central government.
[00:33:09.493 --> 00:33:11.595]  They wanted state government and states ought to want
[00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.820]  Congressman Ron Paul,
[00:33:39.674 --> 00:33:46.638]  You gave a speech on July 10th on the floor of the House that we have posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:46.678 --> 00:33:53.782]  It's also on your website, and we'll give that address out in a few minutes, titled, Neocon.
[00:33:54.042 --> 00:34:02.447]  And you used quotes by prominent Neocon leaders, people that are in the White House, in the Cabinet, outside the White House.
[00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:06.649]  You quoted from a book that you've been given at a Republican leadership conference.
[00:34:07.744 --> 00:34:22.793]  And you talked about the Trotskyite, Machiavellian, entering into evil social welfare states, big government Republican ideas, and how the conservative revolution has been totally co-opted.
[00:34:22.813 --> 00:34:26.015]  Now, those are quotes from your speech.
[00:34:26.075 --> 00:34:32.298]  Can you speak to the neocons, and how one of the neocons you quoted called up and told you, how dare you?
[00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:52.890]  Yeah, and the book I clarified the most in that speech was by Michael Ledeen, who works at the American Enterprise Institute, and this is where the individuals are congregated that, you know, are those philosophers behind this, and they believe it.
[00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.691]  They're a little bit different than the average lefty
[00:34:57.542 --> 00:34:59.444]  Internationalist that wants to run the UN.
[00:34:59.464 --> 00:35:04.248]  They're sort of the fascist types who would like to have control of the United Nations.
[00:35:04.828 --> 00:35:23.003]  But the speech not only dealt with the neoconservatives who are promoting this preemptive type of foreign policy where we go and we start the wars ourselves, but I also included that some of the other distortions on the conservative side that has come together.
[00:35:23.143 --> 00:35:25.465]  For instance, supply siders
[00:35:26.036 --> 00:35:32.597]  We're very decent, honest people, but they happen to have been teaching for the last 20 years that deficits don't matter.
[00:35:32.717 --> 00:35:34.438]  Well, that's not true conservatism.
[00:35:35.078 --> 00:35:46.560]  And so the neocon includes both the foreign policy and the domestic policy of deficits don't matter, and that what we need is a Federal Reserve that prints the money faster rather than slower.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:54.402]  So whether it's the domestic economic issues, or whether it's the foreign policy issue, this comes together as something that
[00:35:54.853 --> 00:36:08.382]  This administration has been championing, and I think it's not what a lot of conservatives believe in, especially many who had supported this administration and many of the Republicans.
[00:36:08.403 --> 00:36:11.545]  This is not what they wanted, and it's not what they had hoped for.
[00:36:12.265 --> 00:36:19.030]  Now, this particular neocon, what did he say when he called you up about quoting his own writings?
[00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.552]  Well, I didn't personally talk to him.
[00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:23.153]  He talked to my staff.
[00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:25.569]  I did send him a couple emails.
[00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:38.793]  His main thrust was he had a threatening tone and I ought to very quickly apologize and refute what I said on the House floor and clear the record or else.
[00:36:39.233 --> 00:36:42.634]  Now, what was the particular quote that you used from his own book that made him so mad?
[00:36:43.194 --> 00:36:50.575]  Well, I guess there were many of them, but just recently in an article that he wrote,
[00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:59.600]  He just doesn't like the attack that the neocons, you know, have this foreign policy.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.481]  And yet, I used his words.
[00:37:01.902 --> 00:37:05.123]  You know, I didn't say, well, this is what I think they believe in.
[00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:07.184]  I just quoted what they've been saying.
[00:37:07.204 --> 00:37:14.188]  Now, yeah, well, you quote prominent neocons talking about the, you know, the helpful attack of September 11th.
[00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:16.629]  That was helpful to get their agenda.
[00:37:16.689 --> 00:37:19.811]  Yeah, it was a lucky, well, they considered Pearl Harbor
[00:37:20.946 --> 00:37:24.089]  I think he used the word lucky, a lucky event.
[00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:25.851]  And so we need another lucky event.
[00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:27.613]  Yeah, and they had written that before 9-11.
[00:37:27.633 --> 00:37:35.861]  And then I also said in there, this doesn't mean that they planned it or knew about it, but it was sort of an opportunity to have their way.
[00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:43.749]  And you know, I think this bears it out because, you know, some of the legislation that was passed quickly after 9-11, even the Patriot Act,
[00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:47.068]  That wasn't brand new material.
[00:37:47.108 --> 00:37:55.596]  This stuff had been floating around, and they had planned on this, and this just gave them, they see it as a lucky event, an opportunity to move their agenda.
[00:37:55.756 --> 00:38:00.501]  Well, Congressman, I have an article out of the Washington Times titled, Patriot Act Cast a Wide Net.
[00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:02.343]  I have another article here where they have U.S.
[00:38:02.383 --> 00:38:06.347]  attorneys admitting, oh yeah, we're using this for drug cases, family violence.
[00:38:06.987 --> 00:38:13.311]  Well, I think the neatest excuse, really the most extreme excuse is that they want to even make some more changes and the reason Ashcroft said we should is
[00:38:35.426 --> 00:38:41.331]  Well, we're doing this anyway, and we just want the law to conform with what we've been doing.
[00:38:42.031 --> 00:38:45.894]  And they have an attitude, you know, break the law, then change the law, and then they're legal.
[00:38:45.914 --> 00:38:47.095]  Yeah, they're implementing.
[00:38:47.115 --> 00:38:47.855]  In fact, they've said that.
[00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:49.356]  We're implementing Patriot Act 2.
[00:38:49.436 --> 00:38:50.457]  Just pass it for us.
[00:38:50.637 --> 00:38:50.817]  Yeah.
[00:38:51.518 --> 00:38:53.980]  And of course, the President was pushing that yesterday.
[00:38:55.103 --> 00:38:59.287]  And, uh, you know, just administrative, uh, search warrants, not even a judge.
[00:38:59.547 --> 00:39:04.651]  I mean, barely have a judge, uh, it doesn't take much judge to issue one of these warrants now.
[00:39:05.012 --> 00:39:06.633]  But now they don't even want to bother with that!
[00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:08.295]  Don't even want to bother?
[00:39:08.315 --> 00:39:11.838]  It means there's no privacy left if this continues.
[00:39:12.118 --> 00:39:14.220]  Well, what is that where they...
[00:39:15.365 --> 00:39:18.808]  Where you have the police as judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:39:19.088 --> 00:39:21.349]  I thought that was Russia, or China, or Mexico.
[00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:27.014]  Well, it's an authoritarian state, and there's all varieties, and I guess we'll get our own if we're not careful.
[00:39:27.414 --> 00:39:42.905]  In your neocon speech, Congressman, you said, number one, the neocons agree with Trotsky on permanent revolution, violent as well as intellectual, that they believe in a large social welfare state.
[00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:44.066]  Can you speak to that?
[00:39:44.955 --> 00:39:49.937]  Yeah, and this came from Irving Kristol, who was the first one in his first book that he wrote on this.
[00:39:51.397 --> 00:39:53.058]  He called himself a neoconservative.
[00:39:53.158 --> 00:40:03.961]  Now, if you notice, that many of the neoconservatives see this as a negative term, and they believe we're being unfair by calling them neoconservatives.
[00:40:03.981 --> 00:40:07.362]  And yet, that's the name they gave themselves, you know, many years ago.
[00:40:07.862 --> 00:40:10.903]  But yeah, they came from the left.
[00:40:11.363 --> 00:40:14.004]  They were identified in the universities as Trotskyites.
[00:40:14.634 --> 00:40:15.995]  And they believed in welfare.
[00:40:16.095 --> 00:40:25.860]  They had nothing to do with conservatism, other than the fact that when they came over, they joined the anti-communist element.
[00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:29.903]  They thought the left was being too weak.
[00:40:30.263 --> 00:40:33.905]  They weren't nationalistic enough, and they weren't anti-communist enough.
[00:40:34.335 --> 00:40:38.277]  So that was their angle to sort of disarm the conservatives.
[00:40:38.297 --> 00:40:44.360]  So now there's a co-opting taking place, and we have the neocons at the head of this.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:58.466]  I mean, they just reported to the Congressional Budget Office and several other private think tanks that the biggest growth in government ever, we've got record spending, we've got Health and Human Services, education, Bush is signing on to UNESCO.
[00:40:59.446 --> 00:41:00.827]  How is that conservative?
[00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:22.672]  I don't see it as being conservative, and I think when I, you know, immediately detected this and would not vote for these programs, you know, there were some rumblings, and there's still a little bit of the very loyal Republicans seeing that, you know, you're supposed to stay together no matter what and just do what they tell you.
[00:41:23.252 --> 00:41:25.253]  But now I think it's starting to change.
[00:41:25.293 --> 00:41:29.394]  I think people are starting to realize, especially those who call themselves conservatives,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.663]  That we're not getting a conservative agenda, not with this kind of spending.
[00:41:33.683 --> 00:41:36.325]  You know, I tell the people, I said, why, what?
[00:41:37.165 --> 00:41:39.287]  And this is not, you know, the real conservative audience.
[00:41:39.347 --> 00:41:46.633]  I said, why does it make any sense that you have to pay all this money to go over and destroy a country and bomb it and kill a lot of innocent people?
[00:41:47.053 --> 00:41:49.495]  And then you immediately have to be taxed again.
[00:41:50.411 --> 00:41:55.116]  And go over there and rebuild it at the risk of our lives, and we lose people doing this.
[00:41:55.896 --> 00:41:58.119]  It's a policy that doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:41:58.399 --> 00:42:13.233]  Congressman, isn't it dangerous, too, to have presidents like Clinton that lie in foreign policy and domestic policy get caught, nothing happens, Bush lies domestically and in foreign policy, and they put out fake CIA reports, and then no one's held accountable?
[00:42:13.713 --> 00:42:24.079]  And now they're making rumblings about Syria, Iran, North Korea, Rumsfeld's leaking battle plans to attack North Korea, hoping to get Kim Jong-il to do a first strike.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.982]  It's like the ten-part plan to get the Japanese to attack us at Pearl Harbor.
[00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:32.985]  What do you see happening in the future, geopolitically, with that?
[00:42:33.965 --> 00:42:37.588]  Well, unfortunately, I don't see much of a shift.
[00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:42.971]  I think they have too much power and control over the propaganda machine.
[00:42:44.013 --> 00:42:49.363]  And fortunately we still do have some radio programs and fortunately we have the internet.
[00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:54.774]  But you saw the figure, I'm sure that 70% of the American people right now believe
[00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.732]  That Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9-11!
[00:42:58.952 --> 00:43:04.454]  When he had always been against groups, the religious Muslims.
[00:43:04.494 --> 00:43:10.037]  Yeah, and you know, as bad as the guy was, there was sort of a balance between two bad people.
[00:43:10.417 --> 00:43:16.440]  You know, the Saddam Husseins of the world, as well as the Al-Qaeda, they sort of fight their own fights over there.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.741]  And that's where their fight ought to be.
[00:43:17.801 --> 00:43:19.001]  It ought not to be here.
[00:43:19.582 --> 00:43:20.822]  And we ought not to be there.
[00:43:20.842 --> 00:43:22.963]  But because we go there, they come here.
[00:43:24.716 --> 00:43:28.579]  And we just aggravate their factions.
[00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:42.411]  During your speech a few weekends ago here in Austin, you talked about how what the globalists are doing, the one-worlders, are pushing a billion, 100 million Muslims to be our enemy when many of them weren't, and they're escalating it.
[00:43:42.431 --> 00:43:44.012]  And I wanted to jump up and say, Congressman,
[00:43:44.942 --> 00:43:54.271]  Rumsfeld's own group, P-2-O-G, at the Pentagon says they're there to get the Muslims to hate us and to attack us, so they have a pretext to then go after them.
[00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:57.595]  Now that's Rumsfeld's own document, and you speak to P-2-O-G.
[00:43:57.795 --> 00:44:01.999]  Well, you know, that's sort of the lucky event that they helped create.
[00:44:02.543 --> 00:44:15.947]  But what about if you go back in history 20 years or so, you know, back as far as more than that, even with Eisenhower, as we, you know, put the Shah in power in Iran, how that led to problems over there.
[00:44:16.547 --> 00:44:27.630]  And then, when we were involved in Afghanistan before, we wanted to undermine the Soviets, so we literally did a lot to create the Al Qaeda in order for them
[00:44:28.243 --> 00:44:33.947]  To oppose the Russians and the Soviets.
[00:44:34.527 --> 00:44:39.150]  They actually came to this country and we helped start the Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:45.094]  And even helped fund some of this radical fundamentalism as an anti-communist movement.
[00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:48.657]  You know, it's motivated well, and you could say, well, isn't that good?
[00:44:48.677 --> 00:44:50.298]  You know, we've got to fight the communists.
[00:44:50.798 --> 00:44:53.480]  But this is the reason why intervention has
[00:44:54.082 --> 00:45:01.366]  You know, this ramifications and unintended consequences, that's why it's much safer to keep our nose out of this, that kind of stuff.
[00:45:01.686 --> 00:45:07.750]  Don't look for these unintended consequences, because it's going to backfire on us, even if it is well-intended.
[00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.672]  And some of it is not always well-intended, either.
[00:45:10.772 --> 00:45:21.278]  You talk about lucky events, though, what the neocons are saying, oh, we need another Pearl Harbor, a Pearl Harbor-type event in there, rebuilding America's defenses, PENAC document, just one of these nightmare documents.
[00:45:22.198 --> 00:45:28.300]  You also, in your speech, talked about this moving us towards a depression with the financial system they've set up.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.760]  But again, unintended consequences.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:37.122]  Out of things falling apart, I see more centralization as the answer like Roosevelt.
[00:45:37.582 --> 00:45:39.463]  I'm saying they'll sell us that as the answer.
[00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:42.244]  You're saying that that is going to backfire on the elite.
[00:45:42.424 --> 00:45:46.485]  Can you speak to that area of depression that you mention in your speech?
[00:45:46.825 --> 00:45:50.466]  Well, you know, I've always been interested in the monetary system.
[00:45:51.278 --> 00:46:06.311]  And the gold standard and its relationship to the Constitution and for 30 years now we've been off the gold standard completely and therefore the politicians can spend without restraint and the Federal Reserve just prints the money.
[00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:12.357]  Now this works for a while and some benefit at the expense of others but eventually then
[00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:22.598]  You have the collapse of the financial system, and I'm anticipating that the dollar is going to get a lot weaker, and we're going to have a lot of inflation, and we're going to have high interest rates.
[00:46:23.018 --> 00:46:27.982]  It's going to play havoc, not just with our domestic economy, but the world economy.
[00:46:28.563 --> 00:46:38.511]  So then, even those who have benefited on the short run by manipulating the currency and getting these benefits, I think they eventually suffer, too.
[00:46:39.327 --> 00:46:42.570]  And nobody knows exactly what will come of it.
[00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.771]  You know, strange things could happen.
[00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:48.354]  Maybe our side will actually be able to get our message out.
[00:46:48.834 --> 00:46:56.360]  But it's now that we have to get our message out on why we believe in limited government, the Constitution, sound money, and a foreign policy that makes sense.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:07.308]  Because in the midst of chaos, you're liable or more likely to have some radical extremist who rides in the white horse and says, we're going to take care of you.
[00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:16.746]  Yeah, it'll be the Democrats, and then suddenly they won't dislike the Patriot Act and Homeland Security, which the Hillary's have voted for.
[00:47:17.807 --> 00:47:18.487]  That's another thing.
[00:47:18.547 --> 00:47:20.208]  Look at the real liberal Democrats.
[00:47:20.248 --> 00:47:21.749]  They're all voting with Bush right now.
[00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:29.815]  That's right, and you know, when they interviewed Kerry and I guess Edwards the other day had some flimsy explanations.
[00:47:30.236 --> 00:47:32.557]  Oh yes, we have to change that Patriot Act.
[00:47:32.578 --> 00:47:36.020]  You know, they're starting to sense what we knew and what we've been listening to.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.141]  Oh yeah, we have to change it.
[00:47:37.557 --> 00:47:39.742]  But the question is, why did you vote for the thing?
[00:47:40.142 --> 00:47:40.483]  You know?
[00:47:40.503 --> 00:47:41.646]  Well, it's like Bob Barr.
[00:47:41.686 --> 00:47:44.071]  He votes for it and later says it's the most evil thing ever.
[00:47:44.692 --> 00:47:45.033]  Yeah.
[00:47:45.333 --> 00:47:48.560]  I mean, it's okay to change your mind and improve your ways, but...
[00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:54.634]  If you already know it and you're suspicious, that's pretty bad when you vote for this stuff.
[00:47:54.975 --> 00:47:58.657]  Congressman, I really appreciate you coming on the show, and if you need to go, I understand.
[00:47:58.777 --> 00:48:00.459]  Can you stay another five minutes?
[00:48:00.799 --> 00:48:02.400]  I can do five more minutes.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.661]  We've got a three-minute break.
[00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:08.045]  We'll come back for just a couple minutes after that, and I've just got a couple of other key questions here.
[00:48:08.065 --> 00:48:10.927]  I've got a whole list of them, but I'm going to pare it down to just a couple.
[00:48:10.947 --> 00:48:15.470]  We'll be right back with Congressman Ron Paul, and you need to go to Infowars.com.
[00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:19.855]  And you need to read his neocon speech.
[00:48:19.875 --> 00:48:25.116]  You want to read his other speeches that are very powerful and informative that he writes every week.
[00:48:25.796 --> 00:48:27.497]  We'll give you his website when we get back.
[00:48:27.517 --> 00:48:30.578]  Stay with us.
[00:48:32.198 --> 00:48:35.059]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:48:35.803 --> 00:48:37.084]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:48:37.284 --> 00:48:43.047]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:48:43.307 --> 00:48:48.570]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.012]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:48:53.192 --> 00:48:56.974]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:48:57.234 --> 00:49:01.857]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:49:01.937 --> 00:49:08.202]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:49:08.242 --> 00:49:10.104]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:49:10.564 --> 00:49:12.646]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:49:12.726 --> 00:49:17.009]  Call toll-free 1-888-2533-139.
[00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:18.370]  That's 1-888-2533-139.
[00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:24.275]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:49:24.375 --> 00:49:26.377]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:49:26.617 --> 00:49:28.118]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:30.360]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:49:31.013 --> 00:49:37.415]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of the table by raising the spigot level.
[00:49:37.575 --> 00:49:43.916]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:49:44.216 --> 00:49:52.978]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:49:53.198 --> 00:50:00.400]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.646]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:50:05.866 --> 00:50:11.392]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:50:11.732 --> 00:50:14.896]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:50:15.236 --> 00:50:20.822]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125.
[00:50:21.863 --> 00:50:25.586]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:50:25.786 --> 00:50:29.909]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:35.353]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[00:50:35.773 --> 00:50:38.855]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:44.279]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:48.082]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[00:50:48.642 --> 00:50:51.765]  This is why the incidence of disease is so much lower when young.
[00:50:52.185 --> 00:50:53.987]  This is why you're skinnier when young.
[00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:57.129]  Looking and feeling young is a direct result of your chemistry.
[00:50:57.569 --> 00:51:01.132]  Science brings us closer to the threshold of eternal youth every day.
[00:51:01.753 --> 00:51:04.515]  Cocoon GH is a sublingual form of growth hormone.
[00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.697]  When used twice a day, people report
[00:51:07.217 --> 00:51:07.838]  Deep sleep.
[00:51:08.078 --> 00:51:09.899]  Improved mood, memory and energy.
[00:51:10.299 --> 00:51:11.400]  Losses of body fat.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.422]  Improved strength and sex drive.
[00:51:13.942 --> 00:51:15.083]  Reduction of joint pains.
[00:51:15.383 --> 00:51:16.984]  Improved blood sugar and more.
[00:51:17.264 --> 00:51:19.266]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[00:51:19.466 --> 00:51:20.807]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[00:51:20.927 --> 00:51:21.227]  Call 800-814-5031.
[00:51:21.247 --> 00:51:21.287]  800-814-5031.
[00:51:21.307 --> 00:51:21.347]  800-814-5031.
[00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:38.631]  We'll come back and take calls and get into all the other news.
[00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:40.614]  There's a website that has a lot of his great speeches, thelibertycommittee.org.
[00:51:40.694 --> 00:51:42.156]  We have a link to that on infowars.com as well.
[00:51:54.437 --> 00:51:56.238]  We're talking to Congressman Ron Paul right now.
[00:51:56.358 --> 00:52:03.662]  Congressman, the Caps 2 system, color coding, you got bad credit, you know, you go down to yellow code, now you don't have any rights.
[00:52:03.962 --> 00:52:09.385]  Now they're talking about putting it in the factories, in the businesses, continuity of government, continuity of industry.
[00:52:09.966 --> 00:52:13.648]  I've seen Ridge on C-SPAN saying we'll all have ID cards to have jobs.
[00:52:14.328 --> 00:52:16.629]  I mean, they're talking about an Orwellian system.
[00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:19.630]  The cell phones now track us with little tracker chips.
[00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:22.011]  And now they want more of this.
[00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:24.693]  How do we stop this flood of Big Brother?
[00:52:25.993 --> 00:52:28.874]  Well, you know, there's no one easy answer for that.
[00:52:29.535 --> 00:52:30.635]  Everybody has a job.
[00:52:30.675 --> 00:52:31.535]  You have your job.
[00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:32.616]  I have my job.
[00:52:33.156 --> 00:52:37.038]  The most important thing we do is call attention to it to alert the people.
[00:52:37.658 --> 00:52:39.979]  And that's where our toughest job is because
[00:52:40.583 --> 00:52:47.586]  The government and those in charge tend to have much more clout when it comes to the control of the mass media.
[00:52:47.606 --> 00:52:52.149]  If you notice, they talk about liberal media and some say it's a conservative media.
[00:52:52.529 --> 00:52:55.610]  It really isn't either as much as it's an establishment media.
[00:52:55.650 --> 00:53:09.277]  How many major national talk shows and how many networks would ever really take on the IRS or the Federal Reserve System or be opposed to internationalism and war?
[00:53:10.393 --> 00:53:13.156]  I mean, they don't touch us because they control that.
[00:53:13.617 --> 00:53:23.088]  It's up to us as individuals and that's why this network, whether it's shortwave radios or internet, we are reaching a lot of people.
[00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:29.155]  We've got a lot of AM and FM affiliates as well.
[00:53:29.215 --> 00:53:30.816]  This is the last question.
[00:53:31.316 --> 00:53:33.178]  Electronic voting machines, Congressman.
[00:53:33.198 --> 00:53:42.866]  There's been massive news articles, but again it hasn't made it on the nightly TV news, where they've caught these companies with back doors, wireless software that no one was told about.
[00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.447]  Very easy to go in and change the votes.
[00:53:45.707 --> 00:53:50.168]  They've caught industry leaders in meetings talking about manipulating things.
[00:53:50.848 --> 00:53:55.469]  Your comments about the touchscreen systems that are in question right now.
[00:53:55.889 --> 00:54:06.251]  Well they had an old-fashioned one like that once many years ago and I lost an election in 1976 by 300 votes and we found evidence of the machines being rigged in the Harris County area.
[00:54:11.826 --> 00:54:18.594]  So now there should be a paper trail for voting, there should be a card, there should be something, otherwise it's just inviting trouble.
[00:54:18.614 --> 00:54:29.667]  Well that's it, and I really hope that you will investigate that at blackboxvoting.com with a corporate investigator, Bev Harris, or infowars.com, we have a large
[00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:36.554]  Vote Fraud, PrisonPlanet.com, Vote Fraud section with mainstream news that you may not have seen from papers around the country.
[00:54:36.574 --> 00:54:41.437]  I mean, they've caught these execs doing, well, stealing elections, and I think you need to see that, Congressman.
[00:54:41.477 --> 00:54:43.359]  That sounds interesting.
[00:54:43.499 --> 00:54:47.101]  Well, God bless you, and have a good weekend, sir.
[00:54:47.302 --> 00:54:47.742]  Thank you.
[00:54:47.782 --> 00:54:48.342]  Good to be with you.
[00:54:48.382 --> 00:54:48.743]  Take care.
[00:54:48.783 --> 00:54:49.183]  Bye-bye.
[00:54:50.164 --> 00:54:58.230]  And I could talk to that guy for several hours, but I mean, you heard him talking about the fortunate events of Pearl Harbor, how they, quote, needed another fortunate event.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:06.105]  On the order of Pearl Harbor, this is the neocon saying we want to get the people to enter into evil, to have our Trotskyite views.
[00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:07.526]  I mean, Ron Paul said all this.
[00:55:07.886 --> 00:55:11.149]  He took their quotes and they called him up to say, you better watch it, buddy.
[00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:12.589]  You better watch what you're doing.
[00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:19.194]  Just like Lionel Chetwin, the guy that made this made-for-TV propaganda about Bush, walked into that bathroom in LA and said, you're Alex Jones.
[00:55:19.214 --> 00:55:20.115]  We're going to get you.
[00:55:20.135 --> 00:55:21.916]  I'm sick of these people.
[00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:32.218]  If you want to get the truth out, if you want to circumvent the mainstream media, get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, The New Book, Order Out of Chaos, do not wait!
[00:55:33.346 --> 00:55:35.928]  Let's tell the truth for those who were murdered by this government.
[00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:40.993]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get them for call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:41.033 --> 00:55:43.555]  That's 888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com.
[00:55:54.765 --> 00:55:55.566]  Take action.
[00:55:55.586 --> 00:56:01.510]  This is some of the most hardcore, focused, documented information put together in a riveting fashion.
[00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:02.591]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:03.531]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:07.514]  Get Order Out of Chaos.
[00:56:07.534 --> 00:56:13.778]  888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:14.459 --> 00:56:16.420]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.461]  Keep it locked in!
[00:56:21.627 --> 00:56:23.289]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:56:23.609 --> 00:56:29.356]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:56:29.596 --> 00:56:32.559]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from water.
[00:56:36.423 --> 00:56:39.587]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.199 --> 00:56:47.839]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.560]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:51.362]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:52.842]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.603 --> 00:56:54.483]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.503 --> 00:56:59.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.366 --> 00:57:03.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:08.011]  Alright, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:08.732]  It's September 11, 2003.
[00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.053]  Your chance to
[00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:19.346]  Chime in on the developments, the destruction of America that's been taking place in the last two years.
[00:57:20.227 --> 00:57:27.094]  Your chance to respond to the Bush-crying-on-TV-last-night-wall-to-wall propaganda.
[00:57:27.134 --> 00:57:28.856]  Bush saying, Bin Laden's gonna be back.
[00:57:29.197 --> 00:57:29.937]  He's gonna get you.
[00:57:29.957 --> 00:57:31.539]  You better pass Patriot Act 2.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.582]  And then suddenly a new Bin Laden tape an hour later appears on TV.
[00:57:35.655 --> 00:57:45.117]  They tried to time it like that earlier this year, right before the war, when Colin Powell testified before Congress and said, Ben Laden's on TV right now, saying he's working with Saddam.
[00:57:45.157 --> 00:57:48.437]  And then, of course, it hadn't come out yet, and he was kind of caught in the headlights.
[00:57:48.497 --> 00:58:01.040]  But they just moved on, moved on along, you know, like NORAD standing down for over an hour, and the CIA running a drill that morning of flying planes into buildings in those two cities and ordering NORAD to stand down.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.980]  They just move on, just move on along.
[00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:08.520]  I want to read the speech of another minister.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.142]  We just had Congressman Ron Paul on.
[00:58:10.162 --> 00:58:12.204]  This one was Michael Mecher.
[00:58:13.225 --> 00:58:15.087]  This war on terrorism is bogus.
[00:58:15.287 --> 00:58:16.869]  The 9-1-1 attacks gave the U.S.
[00:58:16.909 --> 00:58:20.493]  an ideal pretext to use force to secure its global domination.
[00:58:22.035 --> 00:58:25.739]  I want to read over this article and talk about the good points and the false points that are in it.
[00:58:26.434 --> 00:58:31.677]  And take your calls as well, and just get into a plethora of other reports here.
[00:58:32.218 --> 00:58:35.380]  It's your chance to respond to just the breakneck propaganda.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:42.184]  And boy, I'm sure the globalists are going to launch another terror attack now with Bush's approval rating dropping, which is a gauge for the globalists.
[00:58:42.244 --> 00:58:47.928]  Bush doesn't run anything, but when his approval rating starts dropping, that's a gauge for the globalists that people aren't buying the propaganda.
[00:58:48.548 --> 00:58:50.789]  David in New York, then Bob in New York and others.
[00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:51.430]  Go ahead, David.
[00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.370]  Hi, Alex.
[00:58:52.731 --> 00:58:53.071]  Welcome.
[00:58:53.502 --> 00:58:56.463]  Hi, uh, I just want to thank you for all the good work that you've done so far.
[00:58:57.123 --> 00:59:03.805]  And, uh, well, basically, if you talked to me before September 11th, I would have thought you were absolutely mad.
[00:59:03.845 --> 00:59:20.691]  But then after, after that, how, you know, how I got into it was because, um, basically the, you know, the authorities, um, they're insulting my intelligence, like with these, the magic passport that flew out of the air and, and, uh, you know, these stories about these,
[00:59:21.397 --> 00:59:41.943]  The so-called hijackers in bars and, you know, uh... They go in bars, leave Koran, say I'm gonna fly planes into buildings tomorrow, leave their business card, get drunk, and all their houses and cars and credit cards are paid for by the FBI and the CIA orders the embassy to give them passports back into the U.S.
[00:59:42.443 --> 00:59:48.705]  and then the people of the FBI and CIA that give them the passports get record cash bonuses?
[00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.046]  And also, like, uh,
[00:59:51.798 --> 00:59:59.546]  And since then I've been reading like crazy and also I found one of the best books on the New World Order.
[01:00:01.008 --> 01:00:04.591]  It's by G. Edward Griffin, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:06.213]  Yeah, the network offers that.
[01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:09.737]  I was reading it and I couldn't believe it.
[01:00:10.433 --> 01:00:12.794]  On the news it says $87 billion.
[01:00:12.854 --> 01:00:16.937]  Bush wants to spend another $87 billion.
[01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:19.858]  Almost all of that goes right into Halliburton and his pockets.
[01:00:20.259 --> 01:00:21.479]  But $87 billion is nothing.
[01:00:21.739 --> 01:00:31.845]  We have a $43.2 trillion deficit according to the Wall Street Journal and the Dallas Morning News.
[01:00:32.685 --> 01:00:33.526]  The Patriots said that
[01:00:34.116 --> 01:00:34.396]  I think so.
[01:00:55.968 --> 01:01:02.171]  And then the red and blue other denominations, and they're going to devalue the other currency, call it in, to kill the dollar.
[01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:02.991]  This is all being done.
[01:01:03.251 --> 01:01:06.893]  They didn't invade Iraq because Saddam was buying dinars, folks.
[01:01:07.633 --> 01:01:14.477]  This is Europe destroying America, using Bush and the Democrats as the technicians to do it.
[01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:15.877]  They're wrecking crews.
[01:01:16.197 --> 01:01:18.238]  And America is the muscle for the globalists.
[01:01:18.538 --> 01:01:24.121]  In the ultimate problem-reaction-solution paradigm, we're taking the blame for a New World Order offensive.
[01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:27.399]  We're just a throwaway, wind-up toy.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:28.861]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:40.198]  And folks, I want you to chime in on what you think the biggest smoking gun or red flag of government involvement in September 11th and other terror events is, what the most disgusting piece of government propaganda you've seen is.
[01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:46.976]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.176 --> 01:01:51.598]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:51.738 --> 01:01:56.140]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.501]  The New World Order.
[01:01:59.302 --> 01:02:03.503]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:10.506]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:10.646 --> 01:02:12.687]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:13.007 --> 01:02:23.131]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:23.631 --> 01:02:29.033]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[01:02:42.037 --> 01:02:43.158]  Are you a diabetic?
[01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:44.558]  Do you know someone who is?
[01:02:44.618 --> 01:02:48.240]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:54.542]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.

[01:03:30.298 --> 01:03:30.338]  800-419-2335.
[01:03:30.358 --> 01:03:30.398]  800-419-2335.
[01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:52.968]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:03:53.128 --> 01:04:00.631]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:04.136]  Farm full or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:04:04.377 --> 01:04:10.165]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:04:10.426 --> 01:04:16.575]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:20.817]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.758]  The water level is always visible.
[01:04:22.938 --> 01:04:28.882]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:04:29.122 --> 01:04:33.064]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:47.508]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:47.869 --> 01:04:50.210]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:57.713]  Alright my friends, back live now into the second hour of this September 11th.
[01:04:59.614 --> 01:05:05.417]  Remembrance of the murder of the American people and others to empower the new world order so they can murder more of us.
[01:05:07.429 --> 01:05:16.438]  Let me read what the Environment Minister, over their nuclear power plants and the rest of it, had to say back on September 6th.
[01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:17.739]  We should have talked more about this.
[01:05:18.159 --> 01:05:20.021]  The war on terrorism is bogus.
[01:05:21.582 --> 01:05:24.405]  The 9-1-1 attacks gave the U.S.
[01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:29.370]  an ideal pretext to use force to secure its global domination.
[01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:31.612]  Now here's the problem.
[01:05:33.743 --> 01:05:34.163]  The U.S.
[01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:34.984]  isn't doing anything.
[01:05:35.024 --> 01:05:40.228]  It's being used as an attack dog by Europe to carry out its takeover of the world.
[01:05:41.209 --> 01:05:44.732]  The private banks owned by Europe then go in and control the third world countries.
[01:05:45.052 --> 01:05:47.394]  They run up American flags and we get the blame.
[01:05:47.414 --> 01:05:48.514]  Then the U.N.
[01:05:48.535 --> 01:05:55.480]  and the IMF and the World Bank and NATO come out looking good and then are used in the next phase of the New World Order takeover.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.881]  This is the London Guardian.
[01:05:58.282 --> 01:05:59.943]  The 9-1-1 attacks gave the U.S.
[01:05:59.983 --> 01:06:03.327]  an ideal pretext to use force to secure its global domination.
[01:06:03.847 --> 01:06:07.531]  You mean the 9-1-1 attacks gave the New World Order an ideal pretext.
[01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:19.143]  You just heard veteran, doctor, most conservative member of Congress for his voting record, Ron Paul, say there's a world government, there's a world government crowd that is out in the open.
[01:06:20.106 --> 01:06:20.586]  Okay?
[01:06:21.046 --> 01:06:31.490]  So when Limbaugh and Hannity say it doesn't exist, they're trying to neutralize you because they, to use their own faulty semantics, are the left-wing Incos.
[01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:32.711]  Literally.
[01:06:33.291 --> 01:06:36.332]  Published by neocon publishers.
[01:06:37.713 --> 01:06:40.494]  Massive attention has now been given, and rightly so.
[01:06:40.554 --> 01:06:42.454]  This is the minister.
[01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:46.136]  By the way, the German intelligence slash
[01:06:47.924 --> 01:06:51.686]  Technology Minister said only the US government can carry out 9-1-1.
[01:06:51.746 --> 01:06:52.386]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:06:53.166 --> 01:06:56.528]  I mean, you've just got to be a little kid to not understand what happened, folks.
[01:06:56.548 --> 01:07:01.029]  You've got to be an idiot, a coward, who makes a decision not to stand up against this.
[01:07:01.049 --> 01:07:01.770]  Let me read the article.
[01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:08.052]  Massive attention has now been given, and rightly so, to the reasons why Britain went to war against Iraq.
[01:07:08.172 --> 01:07:11.634]  But far too little attention has focused on why the US went to war
[01:07:12.999 --> 01:07:15.540]  And that throws light on British motives too.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:27.766]  The conventional explanation is that after the Twin Towers were hit, retaliation against Al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan was a national first step in launching a global war against terrorism.
[01:07:27.786 --> 01:07:34.289]  Of course, they don't tell you there were 40,000 US troops and 18,000 British troops mashing into Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
[01:07:34.569 --> 01:07:36.370]  Bush had launch orders on his desk.
[01:07:37.435 --> 01:07:40.316]  Then, because Saddam Hussein was alleged by the U.S.
[01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:40.716]  and U.K.
[01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:44.698]  governments to retain weapons of mass destruction, the war could be extended to Iraq as well.
[01:07:44.758 --> 01:07:47.880]  However, the theory does not fit all the facts.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.981]  The truth may be a great deal murkier.
[01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:55.343]  We now know that a blueprint for the creation of a Pax America
[01:07:56.525 --> 01:07:57.866]  That's a Roman term.
[01:07:58.326 --> 01:08:09.655]  Was drawn up for Dick Cheney, now Vice President, Donald Rumsfeld, Defense Secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld's Deputy, Jeb Bush, Bush's younger brother, and Louis Libby, Cheney's Chief of Staff.
[01:08:09.735 --> 01:08:21.163]  The document entitled, Rebuilding America's Defenses, that means destroying America, empowering the New World Order, doublespeak, was written in September 2000 by the neoconservative think tank, Project for a New American Century, or PNAC.
[01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:28.781]  The plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf region, whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power.
[01:08:29.621 --> 01:08:41.668]  That's right, it says, quote, while the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides an immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.
[01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:46.930]  They went on in the same document to say he provided a convenient pretext for an invasion.
[01:08:47.731 --> 01:08:51.413]  The PENAC blueprint supports an earlier document attributed to Wolfowitz and Libby
[01:08:52.634 --> 01:08:53.354]  Which said the U.S.
[01:08:53.414 --> 01:09:02.059]  must discourage advanced industrial nations from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:07.522]  And when you hear, we, we, we, that means the private banks that own America using us as muscle.
[01:09:08.022 --> 01:09:09.984]  Under this globalism, you're going to lose your job.
[01:09:10.024 --> 01:09:14.266]  They say the high-tech outsourcing is going to be seven times worse to India.
[01:09:14.426 --> 01:09:15.046]  Just India.
[01:09:15.366 --> 01:09:16.227]  Seven times worse.
[01:09:16.507 --> 01:09:19.769]  They say Mexico is going to get five times doubled what it is now.
[01:09:21.445 --> 01:09:22.065]  It continues.
[01:09:22.165 --> 01:09:23.986]  So, this means total enslavement for you.
[01:09:24.046 --> 01:09:26.528]  Understand it's not, oh, America will be the big dog.
[01:09:26.588 --> 01:09:28.589]  No, these are guys destroying America.
[01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:35.533]  It refers to key allies such as the UK as the most effective and efficient means of exercising American global leadership.
[01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:42.016]  It describes peacekeeping missions as demanding American political leadership rather than that of the UN.
[01:09:42.536 --> 01:09:46.258]  But notice they increase the UN's funding while, again, acting like they're against it.
[01:09:46.298 --> 01:09:47.439]  This is all sophisticated.
[01:09:48.038 --> 01:09:54.463]  It even should Saddam pass, there's a quote, it says, quote, even should Saddam pass from the scene, U.S.
[01:09:54.483 --> 01:10:02.028]  bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain as Iran will prove as large a threat to the U.S.
[01:10:02.088 --> 01:10:03.289]  interests as Iraq has.
[01:10:03.349 --> 01:10:09.273]  It spotlights China for regime change, saying it is time to increase the presence of American forces in Southeast Asia.
[01:10:09.813 --> 01:10:12.595]  However, the same neocons perfected their long-range missiles.
[01:10:13.196 --> 01:10:14.897]  See, they want to go into this third world war.
[01:10:16.678 --> 01:10:21.720]  And the head of the CIA, former head, Woolsey, says it's the 4th World War.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.982]  Imagine, national drafts, looting the flags everywhere, crimson-black uniforms marching around.
[01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:28.743]  We had a World War III, folks.
[01:10:28.983 --> 01:10:31.304]  They'll get all that, and we'll never emerge from it.
[01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:35.066]  And then Europe will sit out of the 3rd World War, come out as the leader.
[01:10:35.086 --> 01:10:35.886]  You understand this?
[01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.367]  It's gonna happen, unless we get the word out.
[01:10:39.474 --> 01:10:41.555]  The document also calls for the creation of U.S.
[01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:50.299]  Space Forces, which are already in total control of the military, I would add, that dominate space and total control of cyberspace to prevent enemies, quote, using the internet against the U.S.
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.901]  It also hints that the U.S.
[01:10:52.921 --> 01:11:02.726]  may consider developing biological weapons that can target specific genotypes and may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[01:11:03.666 --> 01:11:09.029]  Now, I just read a quote from the Project for a New American Century, one of their documents, Rebuilding American Defenses.
[01:11:10.038 --> 01:11:16.943]  Jane's Weapons publication, the premier group, put out a worldwide emergency alert six months ago saying, Israel, the U.S.
[01:11:16.983 --> 01:11:21.886]  and England have developed race-specific bioweapons and are preparing systems to deploy them.
[01:11:22.307 --> 01:11:36.457]  Folks, stuff that kills all Germans, all truly Semitic Jews, all of the Middle Eastern Muslims, all subgroups of certain Asian classes.
[01:11:37.387 --> 01:11:42.132]  This is them bragging, oh, we can have race-specific weapons that are a valuable tool!
[01:11:44.394 --> 01:11:47.357]  That admittedly will spread worldwide and kill entire races!
[01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:49.178]  Now I've been screaming bloody murder!
[01:11:50.439 --> 01:12:00.309]  Bush is preparing forced inoculation, 5.8 billion in funding, and trying to get 6.3, for BioShield, three dozen level 4 bio-weapons labs to be built in all your major cities,
[01:12:00.979 --> 01:12:09.242]  They're preparing giant cod grays and a national draft of medical personnel and police to forcibly inject you and to force them to take the shots.
[01:12:10.602 --> 01:12:15.404]  The CFR members like Gary Hart have gotten up on TV and have said, we are going to be hit.
[01:12:15.884 --> 01:12:19.645]  We are going to be hit by smallpox in Dallas, Cleveland, and Denver.
[01:12:19.665 --> 01:12:20.886]  Better give up all your rights.
[01:12:22.486 --> 01:12:23.827]  I mean, this is sick, folks!
[01:12:24.969 --> 01:12:26.731]  The document also calls for the creation of U.S.
[01:12:26.751 --> 01:12:27.432]  Space Forces.
[01:12:27.452 --> 01:12:28.133]  It goes on, U.S.
[01:12:28.153 --> 01:12:42.691]  may consider developing biological weapons that, quote, this is from the document, can target specific genotypes and may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[01:12:42.932 --> 01:12:43.793]  Did you hear me?
[01:12:45.726 --> 01:12:56.270]  Finally, written a year before 9-1-1, it pinpoints North Korea, Syria, and Iran as dangerous regimes, and says that their existence justifies the creation of the Worldwide Command and Control System.
[01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.770]  Ha ha!
[01:12:58.150 --> 01:12:58.510]  Ha ha!
[01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:01.191]  A Worldwide Command and Control System!
[01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.432]  The casual society slave grid!
[01:13:04.389 --> 01:13:23.482]  They've announced now, they want to make it the law, ABC News yesterday, to have a job anywhere, you're going to have to wear an ID badge with an RFID chip that tracks you everywhere, and to drive a car you're going to have it, they just so happen to already be put in them, and they're going to track you everywhere you go, and your cell phone does it, and oh, there's going to be hover blimps watching you and looking through your walls with a ground penetrating radar!
[01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:28.825]  Are you starting to get how serious this is?
[01:13:29.546 --> 01:13:30.126]  Read that again.
[01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:33.949]  Finally, written a year before 9-1-1, it pinpoints North Korea, Syria, and Iran,
[01:13:34.728 --> 01:13:40.122]  As dangerous regimes and says their existence justifies the creation of a worldwide command and control system!
[01:13:41.033 --> 01:13:51.540]  I told you, the elite want world dictatorship, so no one can have technologies, no one can bring out new technologies for energy, no one can bring out life extension and disease cures.
[01:13:52.001 --> 01:13:57.324]  All of that goes to the elite, who then create a parallel system above us, the dumbed-down mass.
[01:13:57.625 --> 01:13:58.045]  Here it is.
[01:13:58.085 --> 01:13:59.746]  I've been telling you this for six, seven years.
[01:14:00.527 --> 01:14:01.908]  I give you the threat matrix.
[01:14:01.948 --> 01:14:02.608]  That's what I do.
[01:14:02.848 --> 01:14:08.792]  I look at all their actions, their propaganda, what their futurists are saying, and I know what they're doing.
[01:14:08.852 --> 01:14:09.453]  And here it is.
[01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:15.604]  It goes on, the blueprint for U.S.
[01:14:15.764 --> 01:14:33.188]  world domination, a worldwide command and control system, but before it dismisses as an agenda for right-wing fanatics, it is clear it provides a much better explanation of what really happened before, during, and after 9-1-1, and the global war on terrorism thesis.
[01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:34.808]  This can be seen in several ways.
[01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:39.510]  So this left-wing guy goes, see, they're right-wingers!
[01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:40.750]  See, he's playing a part.
[01:14:42.106 --> 01:14:44.448]  Don't think he's out in the open saying this for nothing, folks.
[01:14:44.508 --> 01:14:47.029]  He's a top minister in England, okay?
[01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:51.792]  You know, why is the German technology minister saying the U.S.
[01:14:51.832 --> 01:14:52.492]  government did it?
[01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:53.833]  It's an absolute fact.
[01:14:53.913 --> 01:14:54.674]  No one else could do it.
[01:14:55.394 --> 01:14:56.655]  Because they own us.
[01:14:56.755 --> 01:14:57.455]  They run us.
[01:14:58.216 --> 01:15:05.740]  And they're going to let everybody see how bad we are, say America did it, when it was an arm of the globalists controlling America.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.323]  See, the globalists are up here controlling a puppet that's America that controls other little puppets.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.441]  You ever seen that poster, that Iron Maiden poster?
[01:15:13.461 --> 01:15:14.342]  I've seen the t-shirt.
[01:15:14.942 --> 01:15:27.229]  It shows, you know, the devil and he's got strings going down to another demon and then that demon's got strings going down to another demon, down to another demon, down to another demon.
[01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:28.910]  I mean, come on listeners!
[01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:30.091]  I know we got artists out there.
[01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:38.216]  Why don't you make a cartoon of the New World Order European Globalist, which strings down to Bush, which strings down to Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:39.013 --> 01:15:40.194]  Creating the crisis.
[01:15:40.454 --> 01:15:45.316]  And on the other hand, creating the police state thugs and black scheme ass to come enslave us.
[01:15:46.316 --> 01:15:49.538]  Folks, I've read one page of this PNAC expose.
[01:15:50.378 --> 01:15:51.399]  It gets worse and worse.
[01:15:51.459 --> 01:15:53.359]  And I'm just reading what's in the document.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.340]  I've read the document on air before.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.682]  I did an analysis of it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement, my new film.
[01:16:00.062 --> 01:16:03.384]  But here's a minister over in England coming out with this.
[01:16:04.284 --> 01:16:04.965]  And yes, it's true.
[01:16:05.005 --> 01:16:05.885]  Our government did it all.
[01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:07.286]  And it gets into that.
[01:16:07.346 --> 01:16:08.086]  And the evidence of it.
[01:16:08.903 --> 01:16:10.524]  But it's not our government, see.
[01:16:11.185 --> 01:16:13.847]  They did it.
[01:16:13.907 --> 01:16:15.368]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:16:15.588 --> 01:16:18.470]  You've got to be sophisticated enough to understand this.
[01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:24.554]  So I'll come back, we'll take some calls, and I'll get back into page 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this article.
[01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:28.217]  And I suggest that you go read the PNAC document.
[01:16:28.957 --> 01:16:32.880]  I suggest you stand up for this Republic and get the word out now.
[01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:35.862]  You're going, man, this guy's excited.
[01:16:35.902 --> 01:16:36.863]  Yeah, aren't you excited?
[01:16:37.224 --> 01:16:38.405]  Isn't this scary?
[01:16:39.026 --> 01:16:39.487]  He'll be back.
[01:16:44.597 --> 01:16:49.599]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.741]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:16:53.201 --> 01:16:56.062]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:16:56.442 --> 01:17:03.566]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:04.986]  That's recovery?
[01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:10.789]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:12.730]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:17:13.419 --> 01:17:16.141]  Hi folks, this is Jack Browner with Midas Resources.
[01:17:20.884 --> 01:17:22.465]  I love the sound of real money.
[01:17:22.865 --> 01:17:28.208]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:17:28.649 --> 01:17:33.232]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[01:17:33.592 --> 01:17:34.432]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[01:17:34.472 --> 01:17:34.652]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:17:42.435 --> 01:17:45.696]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:17:45.836 --> 01:17:50.057]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:17:50.338 --> 01:17:53.198]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:55.799]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:17:55.999 --> 01:18:04.722]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:18:04.942 --> 01:18:06.303]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:18:06.523 --> 01:18:10.884]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:18:11.304 --> 01:18:13.045]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:18:13.325 --> 01:18:25.389]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:32.271]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:35.372]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:43.137]  Oh my God!
[01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:48.123]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.084]  Yes, it's true.
[01:18:49.184 --> 01:18:51.867]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:18:52.007 --> 01:18:56.032]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:18:56.152 --> 01:18:56.713]  You heard it right.
[01:18:56.873 --> 01:18:59.536]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief,
[01:18:59.696 --> 01:19:01.898]  Anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:19:02.018 --> 01:19:03.079]  The list goes on and on.
[01:19:03.299 --> 01:19:07.402]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.

[01:20:49.059 --> 01:20:52.921]  I've been here in Ranton Lane for three hours.
[01:20:54.002 --> 01:20:55.102]  I want to take a lot of calls.
[01:20:55.122 --> 01:20:58.865]  I want to get back into this neocon activity.
[01:21:00.305 --> 01:21:01.886]  Now the sick stuff they talk about.
[01:21:02.227 --> 01:21:03.807]  Killing us with biological weapons.
[01:21:03.847 --> 01:21:04.648]  How that's good.
[01:21:05.028 --> 01:21:06.189]  Race specific stuff.
[01:21:06.809 --> 01:21:11.392]  How they're going to create a global control system.
[01:21:11.472 --> 01:21:13.273]  Worldwide command and control system.
[01:21:14.065 --> 01:21:17.647]  Oh, they're going to take all our liberties, use social welfare systems to control us?
[01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:19.969]  I mean, this is sick stuff, folks!
[01:21:20.269 --> 01:21:22.030]  Written by Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld!
[01:21:25.092 --> 01:21:33.658]  They got a bunch of vampires running things, who want your guns, who want to break up your family, who radically increased the funding for CPS to grab kids.
[01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.299]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble!
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.282]  And they got all their neocon trash, you know, the J-Seculos and the
[01:21:39.947 --> 01:21:46.094]  And the limbos on the air tellin' us how good all this is, and, oh, the liberals are lyin' about the Patriot Act.
[01:21:46.274 --> 01:21:47.335]  You just heard Ron Paul.
[01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:50.038]  No more warrants to arrest you.
[01:21:50.499 --> 01:21:52.221]  Randomly, the FBI comes and grabs you.
[01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.102]  You're never seen again.
[01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:55.417]  I mean, this is hell on earth, folks.
[01:21:55.737 --> 01:22:08.305]  What do you think about 9-1-1, the biggest smoking guns you'd like to talk about, and how do you respond to the disgusting propaganda of Bush crying on TV last night, and Bin Laden's gonna get you if you don't give your rights up, you don't pass Patriot Act 2.
[01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:10.406]  I mean, how transparent does it have to get?
[01:22:11.607 --> 01:22:13.428]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in New York.
[01:22:13.468 --> 01:22:14.128]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:22:14.389 --> 01:22:14.829]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:15.329]  How are you?
[01:22:15.569 --> 01:22:15.929]  Pretty good.
[01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:26.495]  Hey, the most recent thing that really kind of turned my stomach was about a week ago the discussion of Jonathan Pollard, the Israeli spy.
[01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:43.662]  And it was on, I think it was on Fox News even, and they were talking about, well, you know, he served 16 years, and, you know, maybe that's a little bit long, and, you know, it's almost like they're wanting to turn high treason, okay, and espionage into, like, a violation.
[01:22:43.682 --> 01:22:45.503]  Well, it's all selectively enforced.
[01:22:45.663 --> 01:22:46.184]  Of course.
[01:22:46.424 --> 01:22:54.991]  You're caught with one marijuana cigarette, life in prison, or secret execution under Victory Act, and I'm not joking, it says all terrorism provisions, and that's death penalty.
[01:22:57.604 --> 01:22:59.565]  And you don't get a trial either.
[01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:01.125]  Folks, you've got to go read it.
[01:23:01.165 --> 01:23:02.425]  It actually says all this.
[01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:04.606]  It's unbelievable.
[01:23:04.966 --> 01:23:10.367]  You know, the other outrage, if you've got somebody who is questioning 9-11 and isn't quite sure.
[01:23:10.387 --> 01:23:15.728]  I had a guy who's a friend of mine, he's like 55, a Vietnam War protester.
[01:23:16.468 --> 01:23:19.469]  Very, very left-wing type person.
[01:23:21.244 --> 01:23:22.606]  He's down with it.
[01:23:22.646 --> 01:23:34.276]  You expose the information, you give him the documentation to read and he all of a sudden starts to discover that this whole left-right paradigm is designed to control you.
[01:23:37.908 --> 01:23:41.589]  Al Franken's, the Limbaugh's, they all go to the same meetings.
[01:23:41.609 --> 01:23:43.089]  They're all members of the same club.
[01:23:43.129 --> 01:23:43.669]  They admit it.
[01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:44.649]  They all love each other.
[01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:46.230]  They all promote each other's books.
[01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:47.430]  Hillary bashes Limbaugh.
[01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:48.390]  He bashes her.
[01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:50.291]  Mentions the name of the book over and over.
[01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:51.091]  It's a deal!
[01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:52.751]  It's like the Bennett brothers.
[01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:54.331]  One's a liberal, one's a conservative.
[01:23:54.632 --> 01:23:56.792]  Well, in reality, they're both the same demonic creature.
[01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.373]  It's like Mary Madeline and Carvel.
[01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:02.113]  This is a husband and wife team.
[01:24:02.133 --> 01:24:04.454]  I mean, that's all any of this is.
[01:24:05.154 --> 01:24:05.914]  And once you show...
[01:24:07.037 --> 01:24:09.438]  I'll go to these leftists, and I'll go, look how the government's out of control.
[01:24:09.458 --> 01:24:10.178]  Look at all the prisons.
[01:24:10.198 --> 01:24:11.278]  Look at how they want to enslave us.
[01:24:11.858 --> 01:24:13.539]  Why would we want to turn our guns into them?
[01:24:14.139 --> 01:24:16.960]  You know, Hitler did that, and they go, yeah, I see what you're saying.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.920]  Maybe the Second Amendment isn't bad.
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.600]  And I go, good, you've been deprogrammed.
[01:24:20.781 --> 01:24:22.621]  You're no longer a liberal or a conservative.
[01:24:22.841 --> 01:24:23.761]  You're a freedom lover.
[01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:26.782]  That's why I go on these talk shows, over a thousand of them now.
[01:24:27.282 --> 01:24:29.043]  And no one calls in to disagree now.
[01:24:29.123 --> 01:24:29.843]  It's no one.
[01:24:29.883 --> 01:24:30.463]  I've probably done
[01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:34.071]  Fifty interviews the last few weeks, no one's called.
[01:24:34.471 --> 01:24:38.394]  I mean, 50,000 waters covering 20 states, middle of the day.
[01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:40.415]  The host is disagreeing with me.
[01:24:40.715 --> 01:24:43.897]  Every caller agrees, and the host suddenly goes, okay, I agree with you.
[01:24:44.398 --> 01:24:45.859]  That's how weak-minded they are.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.661]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:24:48.901 --> 01:24:49.701]  Alright, thank you.
[01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:51.763]  And this is the system we're fighting.
[01:24:52.143 --> 01:24:53.144]  Neoconstar.
[01:24:55.585 --> 01:24:56.786]  This is the system we're fighting.
[01:24:57.603 --> 01:24:58.525]  NEOCONSTAR!
[01:25:12.093 --> 01:25:15.375]  Neoconstar, how can I offer you great service today?
[01:25:15.395 --> 01:25:17.857]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car.
[01:25:17.937 --> 01:25:19.798]  My retina scanner won't work.
[01:25:20.018 --> 01:25:21.139]  Just relax, sir.
[01:25:21.279 --> 01:25:23.000]  It's not sir, it's ma'am.
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.801]  Please hurry, it's hot in here.
[01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:29.824]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database, I have you at the Monsanto Mart on 2nd Street.
[01:25:29.944 --> 01:25:30.224]  Right.
[01:25:30.524 --> 01:25:34.927]  I have a live shot of you from the Neoconstar Observation Blimp in your area.
[01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.268]  I'm an old lady.
[01:25:36.568 --> 01:25:39.650]  Alright sir, looks like you have no outstanding warrants, so you're not a newbie.
[01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:43.562]  We're good to go.
[01:26:33.104 --> 01:26:36.090]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.031 --> 01:26:39.696]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.967 --> 01:26:47.572]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[01:26:47.752 --> 01:26:53.619]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[01:27:13.232 --> 01:27:28.820]  When the FBI agents wrote a memo saying that the hijackers were planning to fly planes into the World Trade Centers, specifically, Bush signed W199I telling them they'd be arrested if they stopped Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.402]  That is, if they stopped the CIA agents walking around going, I'm Al-Qaeda, I'm Al-Qaeda!
[01:27:34.623 --> 01:27:35.903]  Can I leave a Koran here?
[01:27:36.163 --> 01:27:37.144]  Can I threaten you?
[01:27:37.384 --> 01:27:38.464]  Remember my face!
[01:27:38.865 --> 01:27:39.705]  I'm Al-Qaeda!
[01:27:40.045 --> 01:27:41.546]  I'm gonna fly planes into buildings!
[01:27:42.293 --> 01:27:44.416]  Then the guys, you know, turn out to still be alive.
[01:27:45.217 --> 01:27:46.660]  Just all of this is total theater.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.501]  I'm going to get back into that.
[01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:49.283]  I do want to take more of your calls a little bit quicker.
[01:27:49.744 --> 01:27:50.765]  Quicker clip here.
[01:27:50.786 --> 01:27:55.292]  The total free number to join us on air on this live September 11th broadcast is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:00.487 --> 01:28:01.608]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:02.548 --> 01:28:13.174]  One of the most blaring examples of government propaganda in the news, using 9-1-1 as a police state and quote, a pretext for a new world order, as Gary Hart said at the CFR meeting.
[01:28:14.214 --> 01:28:15.815]  And what's the biggest red flag?
[01:28:16.835 --> 01:28:24.599]  Or smoking gun of the hundreds of thousands really that are out there of the sloppy job the globalists did on September 11th.
[01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:31.743]  And you get the big picture of how Europe controls us and is now letting all this come out to demonize America worldwide.
[01:28:32.104 --> 01:28:36.706]  When really it's Europe using us as the attack bulldog to take over.
[01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:39.168]  It's like they used the Soviets in the last century.
[01:28:40.488 --> 01:28:43.230]  It's something else when you figure out their operational system.
[01:28:44.935 --> 01:28:51.120]  I mean, I just read a PNAC document where they said they want to develop race-specific viruses, bacteria, to kill certain races.
[01:28:51.721 --> 01:28:53.242]  That's the Vice President, people!
[01:28:53.262 --> 01:28:56.745]  And you better believe it's for you.
[01:28:57.145 --> 01:28:58.226]  You better believe it.
[01:28:59.707 --> 01:29:12.298]  Before I go back to the calls, I'm gonna, when I get off the air here in an hour and, uh, twenty-five minutes, I'm gonna get in my vehicle, and I'm gonna drive down to South Texas, to Houston, to West Houston.
[01:29:13.542 --> 01:29:23.949]  When I get to Western Houston, I am going to go into the Western Oak Shopping Center, and I'm going to give a 30-minute speech there at the Alamo Draft House Cinema.
[01:29:24.409 --> 01:29:31.954]  Then I'm going to show the Road to Tyranny, and then I'm going to play the film THX 1138, the George Lucas classic.
[01:29:32.475 --> 01:29:36.397]  It'll be a thing that'll go on from 7 to 1130 at night.
[01:29:37.018 --> 01:29:38.759]  Seven bucks gets you into both features.
[01:29:39.787 --> 01:29:47.810]  Okay, so I look forward to seeing everybody down there and meeting and talking to you and it's going to be fantastic in Houston today!
[01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:52.471]  And I still didn't call my uncle and tell him I was going to be there.
[01:29:54.772 --> 01:29:58.193]  And I still didn't, my great-uncle, I need to do that.
[01:29:58.213 --> 01:29:59.834]  I need to call my dad and tell him to do that for me.
[01:30:02.035 --> 01:30:05.496]  I've been so busy I've got to get a few people on the guest list too, some media people and
[01:30:07.031 --> 01:30:08.972]  Well, I don't know about a red flag or a smoking gun.
[01:30:08.992 --> 01:30:09.972]  To me, it's all in plain view.
[01:30:09.992 --> 01:30:10.532]  But I do know that
[01:30:37.059 --> 01:30:42.922]  There's a species of snake out there called the Anacondia luciferia as a cobra clutch on the media.
[01:30:43.482 --> 01:30:52.828]  That's the only reason why the public, the mass public now, doesn't know what happened on 9-11, at least the true factual account of what happened.
[01:30:53.968 --> 01:31:00.912]  If it wasn't for that, I mean, people would be greeming to have Bush's head on a platter, literally.
[01:31:02.324 --> 01:31:12.168]  Well, Bush is a puppet, and I don't wish any harm upon the Chief Executive, or Bill Clinton, or any other snot-nosed brat of the New World Order.
[01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:15.109]  Any other fake crying... I mean, that's so sick.
[01:31:15.349 --> 01:31:17.570]  Watching that on 60 Minutes 2, Bush... Did he really cry?
[01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:20.091]  He couldn't even get a tear out, so he touched his eye.
[01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:21.432]  He really cried on TV?
[01:31:21.592 --> 01:31:22.232]  Well, he tried.
[01:31:22.252 --> 01:31:23.953]  He kept trying to, you know, he rehearsed it.
[01:31:24.673 --> 01:31:28.935]  And he just kept trying and trying, and he went, look, look, he touched it.
[01:31:30.206 --> 01:31:31.407]  It was sickening.
[01:31:31.627 --> 01:31:33.668]  It was like watching Ted Bundy in his trial.
[01:31:34.369 --> 01:31:34.609]  It is.
[01:31:34.649 --> 01:31:35.710]  It's akin to the same thing.
[01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:37.050]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:38.591]  But, I mean, he's a minion.
[01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:39.692]  He is.
[01:31:39.732 --> 01:31:40.332]  He's a puppet.
[01:31:40.432 --> 01:31:41.573]  He's a puppet.
[01:31:41.593 --> 01:31:42.534]  Total puppet.
[01:31:43.554 --> 01:31:45.656]  But I like to talk about the Schiavo thing.
[01:31:47.017 --> 01:31:48.457]  What's going on with that poor lady.
[01:31:48.898 --> 01:31:49.218]  Sure.
[01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:53.160]  I think, symbolically, it's almost analogous to what's going on in this society.
[01:31:53.601 --> 01:31:54.681]  And we know what they're doing with her.
[01:31:54.701 --> 01:31:55.882]  We know.
[01:31:55.902 --> 01:31:58.003]  We don't directly say it, but I know what you meant yesterday.
[01:32:00.262 --> 01:32:04.626]  It's like a weed choking a helpless flower.
[01:32:04.646 --> 01:32:05.947]  That's what's going on in this society.
[01:32:06.448 --> 01:32:08.990]  I think it's almost symbolic of what's going on over here in this country.
[01:32:09.771 --> 01:32:10.772]  Nobody wants to wake up.
[01:32:11.933 --> 01:32:14.175]  Well, their feeding tube is also being taken away.
[01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:15.416]  They don't have much time.
[01:32:15.576 --> 01:32:19.180]  If they don't wake up, they're going to go down also.
[01:32:19.745 --> 01:32:26.470]  I mean, did you... PNAC document says they want to use race-specific bioweapons on us, and a quote... It doesn't surprise me.
[01:32:26.490 --> 01:32:27.090]  It doesn't surprise me.
[01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:33.435]  How many years... I don't know how long you've been listening, but I said, they're gonna create a global control grid, lock us down, and then bioweapon us.
[01:32:33.855 --> 01:32:34.976]  And we got them saying it.
[01:32:35.256 --> 01:32:36.998]  And so far, they've been carrying it out.
[01:32:37.338 --> 01:32:38.419]  They're just more sophisticated.
[01:32:38.439 --> 01:32:43.522]  You see, in the past, they would hang black men on a tree, but they know that brute force can be turned against you.
[01:32:43.722 --> 01:32:44.743]  They're more sophisticated.
[01:32:44.783 --> 01:32:48.586]  They've developed more subtle ways, and better,
[01:32:49.258 --> 01:32:51.819]  As far as for them to progress, they've developed better ways.
[01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:52.879]  We passed the Romans.
[01:32:53.499 --> 01:32:59.661]  Many say this is the continuation of the Roman Empire, due to the symbolism and all the degradation and immorality.
[01:32:59.701 --> 01:33:02.942]  But I think in this perpetuation, there's been a progress for them.
[01:33:03.142 --> 01:33:04.602]  It's worse than the Roman Empire.
[01:33:05.263 --> 01:33:05.803]  Ten times.
[01:33:06.683 --> 01:33:15.266]  I mean, they don't put it in the news that they're going to kill poor women on TV and kill them and take their lives away when they're pleading to be fed.
[01:33:16.146 --> 01:33:16.706]  I mean, come on.
[01:33:18.018 --> 01:33:20.139]  All over they're euthanizing people who are begging for food.
[01:33:20.159 --> 01:33:20.880]  Have a good one, Alex.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.000]  Thanks for the call.
[01:33:22.081 --> 01:33:22.681]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:33:22.701 --> 01:33:24.322]  That's it.
[01:33:24.342 --> 01:33:26.923]  I mean, just 50 million abortions, folks.
[01:33:27.024 --> 01:33:28.564]  You know, I just rounded it down.
[01:33:28.584 --> 01:33:30.626]  It's 54 million and a half.
[01:33:31.766 --> 01:33:32.647]  Yeah, you know, so many.
[01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:34.408]  We didn't even talk about the other four and a half mil.
[01:33:34.428 --> 01:33:35.248]  50 million.
[01:33:35.268 --> 01:33:37.690]  You know, just, ah, mil here, mil there.
[01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:38.911]  Yeah, the globalist guild.
[01:33:39.451 --> 01:33:40.432]  200 million last century.
[01:33:41.132 --> 01:33:43.573]  And now they're setting it up to do it here in these yuppies.
[01:33:43.633 --> 01:33:44.294]  These yuppies.
[01:33:45.299 --> 01:33:46.260]  Trying to keep what they got.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.002]  They'll do anything the government says.
[01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:49.564]  They'll jump how high when they say it.
[01:33:50.004 --> 01:33:56.651]  I always did good in the past, they say, by kissing up to everybody and following orders and being a slug.
[01:33:57.272 --> 01:33:59.955]  Well, you're going to get stomped on now by your own master.
[01:33:59.975 --> 01:34:03.078]  I can hear you little slugs begging, please don't step on me!
[01:34:03.118 --> 01:34:03.358]  No!
[01:34:03.639 --> 01:34:04.580]  I sold everybody out!
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:05.040]  Ah!
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:05.440]  No!
[01:34:05.561 --> 01:34:05.761]  Eek!
[01:34:06.775 --> 01:34:09.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Texas.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:10.641]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:34:11.002 --> 01:34:11.502]  Hi Alex.
[01:34:12.163 --> 01:34:18.233]  Basically, I'm just going to say that I think one of the biggest points that I think about when I think back about the attacks that took place was the fact that
[01:34:19.099 --> 01:34:24.103]  No fighter aircraft intercepted those commercial airplanes enroute to the towers.
[01:34:24.303 --> 01:34:25.143]  Over an hour?
[01:34:25.644 --> 01:34:32.609]  And then like an hour and thirty-something minutes from the time that the third one goes, I mean it goes on and on and on.
[01:34:32.929 --> 01:34:33.209]  Right.
[01:34:33.489 --> 01:34:45.258]  And there was just no, there were no intercepts at whatsoever, but of course I do remember back in October of 1999 when Payne Stewart's private jet basically went off course and there were fighter planes on his wings probably within 15 to 20 minutes from the time he went off course.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:51.422]  Yeah, they were launched within about 9 minutes, and within 18 minutes there were 5 F-16s around him.
[01:34:51.922 --> 01:35:04.826]  So, that raises major flags, basically because these are big commercial airliners, and they hold a lot more people than a private jet would hold, so it raises all kinds of questions as to why they weren't intercepted, quite frankly.
[01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:08.287]  And it's a very tragic day as I look back for America.
[01:35:09.198 --> 01:35:10.078]  Let's see what happened.
[01:35:10.398 --> 01:35:20.081]  It was also a very pivotal time as far as what we've talked about and what you've talked about and others have talked about for a long time now as far as changing the focus of America now to a war against terrorism.
[01:35:20.761 --> 01:35:25.062]  And as you said, it gave them the pretense to go ahead and fight the war against terrorism that we're conducting now.
[01:35:25.162 --> 01:35:32.204]  But, you know, it's really interesting the things you point out about how the Europeans are basically going to sit back and watch us as we basically engage in all these activities.
[01:35:32.224 --> 01:35:36.865]  Then they'll be out of it and they'll be considered to be the good guys when the UN comes in and other forces come in.
[01:35:37.762 --> 01:35:40.363]  Well, I mean, there is no separation.
[01:35:40.443 --> 01:35:43.984]  The Europeans, according to Forbes, own the majority of our Federal Reserve.
[01:35:44.265 --> 01:35:46.525]  They're the ones pulling the strings, doing all this.
[01:35:46.966 --> 01:35:51.727]  America, the mantle of America, is just the envelope that their agenda's in.
[01:35:52.488 --> 01:35:55.449]  And so that's why they'll come out and admit that our government did it.
[01:35:56.467 --> 01:36:03.749]  Because they know the world will see that only in a two-dimensional layering and go, oh, that's the USA, those cowboys.
[01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:08.231]  And see Bush is from Texas, they say, oh, that wild cowboy.
[01:36:08.291 --> 01:36:17.353]  Again, it's that image of what America really is being bad, when in truth, it's a little, stunted, blue-blood, skull-and-bones member playing a part for his masters.
[01:36:17.634 --> 01:36:25.656]  You know, Alex, if you get a chance sometime, and I know you're a very busy person, but if you get a chance sometime, if you look back at the old James Bond movies, and I like them all, I have every one of them as a matter of fact,
[01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:31.689]  But I was going to say that back in the early 60s, like 63, to Russia, I'm sorry, from Russia with love, etc.
[01:36:32.129 --> 01:36:37.372]  You'll notice in movies like that that there was an example given by the so-called spectra, which is what they call a spectra.
[01:36:37.412 --> 01:36:41.974]  I believe they called him the evil power back then that was fighting Bond and his group.
[01:36:42.014 --> 01:36:49.178]  But what I'm saying is there's some examples given about how, for example, how they'll use two little fishes, they'll fight each other in the boat, and the third fish sits back and waits.
[01:36:49.738 --> 01:36:54.581]  And when the two fishes have exhausted themselves by fighting each other out or whatever, having their combat in the water,
[01:36:54.949 --> 01:36:55.409]  We're good to go.
[01:37:17.228 --> 01:37:25.374]  Anyway, I appreciate what you do, Alex, and your courage every day as you get up there and so many others like you that are in your ranks that are just letting the word get out consistently and persistently.
[01:37:25.954 --> 01:37:35.281]  I appreciate what you're doing because I know you're putting a few bumps in the road for the Glovist along the way so their ride is not quite as smooth as they thought it would be and I appreciate what you do.
[01:37:35.801 --> 01:37:36.302]  Well, thank you.
[01:37:36.342 --> 01:37:37.202]  I appreciate the call.
[01:37:38.891 --> 01:37:40.912]  It's mind-boggling, all the things that have happened.
[01:37:40.932 --> 01:37:47.895]  I mean, when you really go through the timelines, and you really go through all the things the Globalists have done, I mean, it's... You would have to be insane.
[01:37:47.975 --> 01:37:52.497]  It's impossible for some hijackers to do what they claim happened.
[01:37:54.117 --> 01:37:57.879]  And then you look at just all the places where the Globalists have been caught.
[01:37:58.779 --> 01:38:00.620]  The thing is, it doesn't matter when they get caught.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.220]  They just keep moving along.
[01:38:03.301 --> 01:38:04.181]  Omar in Michigan.
[01:38:04.221 --> 01:38:05.002]  Go ahead, Omar.
[01:38:05.562 --> 01:38:08.583]  Yeah, I think it's time to turn up the fire on them.
[01:38:09.428 --> 01:38:16.911]  We need to demand that all involved in the 9-1-1 attacks, from the globalists to the Bush administration, be brought to justice.
[01:38:16.971 --> 01:38:20.793]  We need to demand that the United Nations leave America.
[01:38:20.813 --> 01:38:25.975]  Then we need to stop buying these foreign goods because that's what's putting us out of work.
[01:38:26.996 --> 01:38:31.898]  And we demand that Congress also repeal all unconstitutional laws.
[01:38:33.198 --> 01:38:36.820]  Now, if a person wants to get an idea of what's coming,
[01:38:37.648 --> 01:38:39.909]  I think they should watch that movie, The Pianist.
[01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.950]  Have you seen it, Alex?
[01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:41.831]  No, I haven't.
[01:38:42.211 --> 01:38:51.557]  Oh, man, that was something else, the way they described what happened to the Jewish people in that movie, in Poland.
[01:38:51.777 --> 01:39:01.643]  I think if people watch that, they'll see that they don't want no new world order, especially some of these neocons that don't know what they're involved in.
[01:39:04.173 --> 01:39:07.636]  Absolutely, and you know, they're going to hang the neocons out to dry.
[01:39:07.656 --> 01:39:10.459]  They're going to be used in all of this.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:22.710]  And out of this, think of how conservatism and lower taxes and the Second Amendment is being discredited right now, falsely, because the left is seeing
[01:39:23.627 --> 01:39:27.290]  Republicanism and conservatism is Bush and Cheney and PNAC.
[01:39:27.690 --> 01:39:29.572]  When in reality, that's their own system.
[01:39:29.932 --> 01:39:33.935]  And it's energizing the universities and the communists and the left wing.
[01:39:34.496 --> 01:39:36.898]  I mean, this is a beautiful globalist plan.
[01:39:37.278 --> 01:39:46.245]  We're going to get a powerful UN, a powerful Secretary General, and they're going to take all that energy and they're just going to, oh, it's going to be horrible.
[01:39:47.266 --> 01:39:48.086]  I agree.
[01:39:48.567 --> 01:39:52.049]  But one of the things that I want to say is that
[01:39:53.191 --> 01:39:57.432]  You cannot let them do anything with taking God out of America.
[01:39:58.353 --> 01:40:02.554]  Because without God, there is no America.
[01:40:02.734 --> 01:40:03.414]  That's all I got.
[01:40:03.554 --> 01:40:04.615]  Thanks for the call.
[01:40:04.895 --> 01:40:09.476]  I agree with you, and that takes the hedge of protection away from us.
[01:40:09.556 --> 01:40:10.777]  Let's go to the next caller.
[01:40:10.797 --> 01:40:11.957]  Which one's up next, guys?
[01:40:13.278 --> 01:40:14.898]  Charles in California, go ahead.
[01:40:15.779 --> 01:40:16.239]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:17.674 --> 01:40:21.215]  I have an opinion for you in the state of Oxfam here.
[01:40:22.036 --> 01:40:23.556]  You're not my minion, please.
[01:40:23.736 --> 01:40:25.217]  Well, I listen to you all the time.
[01:40:25.237 --> 01:40:27.718]  I bought all your videos except for two of them.
[01:40:28.678 --> 01:40:29.979]  And I ordered those other books.
[01:40:30.599 --> 01:40:35.441]  Anyways, did you hear that lady that was speaking on Jerry Brownfield's show before your show?
[01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:36.401]  No, I didn't.
[01:40:37.161 --> 01:40:47.385]  Her name was Joan, and she was basically down at the World Trade Organization meeting down in Cancun, and she was basically saying everything that you say.
[01:40:48.427 --> 01:40:56.509]  Things such as they're going to put on that tax, 20-25% kind of a value-added tax coming in the future.
[01:40:56.529 --> 01:41:13.293]  She also was saying that there was basically an income tax, not an income tax, but when you get a depreciation on your house every year for paying the interest, that was going to be eliminated within 5-10 years.
[01:41:14.694 --> 01:41:16.015]  Yeah, that's Joan Vion.
[01:41:16.315 --> 01:41:16.996]  Yeah.
[01:41:17.616 --> 01:41:19.877]  She goes to all the meetings and records what they have to say.
[01:41:19.917 --> 01:41:21.578]  I mean, it's been on the record for 20 years.
[01:41:21.598 --> 01:41:23.219]  They're going to take all our private property.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:28.282]  They're going to create a sales tax on top of an income tax.
[01:41:28.363 --> 01:41:29.403]  See, that's how the scam works.
[01:41:29.423 --> 01:41:30.964]  People think, oh, a sales tax.
[01:41:31.064 --> 01:41:31.785]  I'm conservative.
[01:41:31.845 --> 01:41:33.065]  I'm out pushing for it.
[01:41:33.125 --> 01:41:34.086]  No, no, no.
[01:41:34.146 --> 01:41:35.067]  That's a plan, folks.
[01:41:35.087 --> 01:41:36.568]  They're going to have both taxes.
[01:41:37.428 --> 01:41:39.089]  There's going to be a tax on driving your car.
[01:41:39.129 --> 01:41:42.491]  Percentage will go to the locals, the state, the feds, and the UN.
[01:41:42.531 --> 01:41:43.572]  That's been announced.
[01:41:44.684 --> 01:41:48.187]  Dozens of new taxes.
[01:41:48.207 --> 01:41:50.428]  The government's going to decide what your kid's going to be.
[01:41:50.448 --> 01:41:52.129]  How could you escape all that?
[01:41:52.249 --> 01:41:55.351]  Move to Montana and live in the middle of nowhere or something?
[01:41:55.531 --> 01:42:00.735]  The problem is in Montana and in Utah and places, there's more provocateur feds.
[01:42:00.775 --> 01:42:07.599]  The feds even pay for a, quote, militia officer or anti-extremist officer on the smallest departments.
[01:42:08.199 --> 01:42:11.722]  And these guys go around framing people, bearing pipe bombs on land,
[01:42:12.482 --> 01:42:16.647]  Uh, they're commissariats, and their job is to frame people so they can pick them up.
[01:42:16.887 --> 01:42:19.029]  The gulag system's already going nationwide.
[01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:26.077]  Well, how can you, uh, you know, basically, I'm living here in California, I'm worried about the Mexicans taking over.
[01:42:26.736 --> 01:42:28.037]  If you own a house?
[01:42:28.117 --> 01:42:29.318]  Well, let me make that clear.
[01:42:29.658 --> 01:42:37.803]  The white bankers have funded a revolution of racism by the race group known as La Raza, which means the race.
[01:42:38.084 --> 01:42:38.344]  Right.
[01:42:38.504 --> 01:42:42.266]  And by the Aslan group, which says they want to kill all whites in their official documents.
[01:42:43.147 --> 01:42:45.689]  And so, you are upset about that.
[01:42:46.409 --> 01:42:50.632]  And, yeah, California, I would evacuate that state.
[01:42:50.692 --> 01:42:53.614]  That is a beta testing area that will be the first to fall.
[01:42:54.693 --> 01:42:56.253]  What about Texas, that too?
[01:42:56.934 --> 01:43:09.677]  Yeah, it's going to go Texas, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, like dominoes, and they're going to bypass Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida will then fall.
[01:43:10.497 --> 01:43:17.959]  And by fall, I mean, you know, they're engineering all sorts of balkanization and infighting and garbage.
[01:43:18.879 --> 01:43:23.500]  So there's basically no hope, I guess, for anybody living in this area.
[01:43:24.927 --> 01:43:26.588]  Well, you heard Ron Paul.
[01:43:26.608 --> 01:43:28.208]  He said, we're going to have a depression last hour.
[01:43:28.248 --> 01:43:28.748]  Did you hear that?
[01:43:28.888 --> 01:43:29.128]  Yeah.
[01:43:29.528 --> 01:43:53.736]  But he said, our hope is to tell people the globalists did it, to tell them their plan, so when they pull the trigger, and America's flopping around bleeding to death, we can basically evacuate, and by evacuate, psychologically, with enough people who know the truth, to then try to reform the government somehow, without the globalists using it to catapult us into a whole other level of tyranny.
[01:43:54.181 --> 01:44:02.728]  Well, I read that book Circle of Intrigue by Tex Mars, which really woke me up to a lot of the reasons why all this is happening.
[01:44:03.328 --> 01:44:07.812]  And, unfortunately, I try to tell people and they just go,
[01:44:08.457 --> 01:44:10.379]  Oh no, it would never happen here.
[01:44:10.539 --> 01:44:17.324]  Oh no, and it's like... And they said that in Russia, China, Germany, France, they said it in Argentina, they said it everywhere.
[01:44:17.725 --> 01:44:26.632]  And I make tapes and hand them to people and they say, I haven't gotten around to looking at it, or no, I, you know, I'd rather watch the game or something.
[01:44:27.132 --> 01:44:37.641]  And they're going to believe the government when they're living in government housing, when they learn how to put their head down in front of a cop, and yet third, we're all going to learn how to be slugs now.
[01:44:38.985 --> 01:44:40.886]  Dirty little pathetic slugs.
[01:44:41.286 --> 01:44:42.046]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:43.487 --> 01:44:45.028]  But the good news is you're in Ron Paul.
[01:44:45.068 --> 01:44:46.668]  There's an awakening like we've never seen.
[01:44:47.869 --> 01:44:58.714]  This awakening's different because the feds can't bomb Oklahoma City or another World Trade Center and then blame it on us because this movement is about realizing that they are the terrorists!
[01:44:58.774 --> 01:44:59.294]  We'll be back!
[01:45:03.382 --> 01:45:07.984]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:45:08.204 --> 01:45:12.767]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[01:45:51.251 --> 01:45:52.492]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:45:52.712 --> 01:45:53.973]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:45:56.835 --> 01:46:01.098]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:46:01.218 --> 01:46:02.618]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:46:03.199 --> 01:46:05.220]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:07.181]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[01:46:08.122 --> 01:46:16.567]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[01:46:17.107 --> 01:46:19.628]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[01:46:20.849 --> 01:46:25.392]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[01:46:26.218 --> 01:46:30.920]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:50.309]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:46:50.929 --> 01:46:53.551]  That's www.libertydollar.org
[01:46:55.009 --> 01:46:59.432]  Or call toll-free 888-421-6181.
[01:46:59.452 --> 01:47:07.698]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:07.858 --> 01:47:12.281]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:12.442 --> 01:47:16.825]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:16.865 --> 01:47:18.186]  The New World Order.
[01:47:19.114 --> 01:47:20.756]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:33.968 --> 01:47:34.388]  We're good to go.
[01:48:08.075 --> 01:48:14.581]  If you believe in what we're doing and our fight here, folks, you'll get our videos, you'll get my book, you'll get the book written by Paul Watson.
[01:48:16.964 --> 01:48:19.466]  You'll get them out to people and expose the serial killers.
[01:48:19.606 --> 01:48:24.511]  Because the serial killers are so arrogant, they wrote down everything they were going to do to you before they did it.
[01:48:25.752 --> 01:48:27.114]  Because they've got a part to play.
[01:48:27.654 --> 01:48:30.457]  And they carried out September 11th, they are the PNAC crowd.
[01:48:32.512 --> 01:48:35.474]  And if we don't expose them, it's going to get real bad real quick.
[01:48:35.514 --> 01:48:39.557]  Now they talk about a global control grid, a global control system.
[01:48:41.138 --> 01:48:48.143]  And how once they have you in the global control system, they will begin race-specific exterminations with biological weapons.
[01:48:48.223 --> 01:48:53.227]  That's why they've been killing off all the top bioweapons experts that helped develop all this.
[01:48:53.267 --> 01:48:54.968]  They've been dying by the scores globally.
[01:48:55.868 --> 01:49:00.732]  They're being shot, stabbed, killed, drowned, run over in cars, found burn up in cars.
[01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:03.738]  Found floating face down in the lakes.
[01:49:04.999 --> 01:49:07.621]  Yes, we're entering very, very scary times right now.
[01:49:09.723 --> 01:49:15.768]  I mean, I'm just reading the PNAC document here, and oh, they want to use race-specific bioweapons on you after the global control grid is in place.
[01:49:15.788 --> 01:49:18.510]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:18.970]  Come on.
[01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:20.851]  You can see pure evil when you see it, can't you?
[01:49:21.672 --> 01:49:23.493]  Worldwide command and control system.
[01:49:23.574 --> 01:49:23.774]  Ha!
[01:49:24.794 --> 01:49:25.275]  What's that?
[01:49:25.315 --> 01:49:27.036]  A worldwide command and control system?
[01:49:27.937 --> 01:49:30.499]  In the same paragraph, race-specific bioweapons.
[01:49:31.602 --> 01:49:35.333]  As I said, they're going to get you herded into the cities, and they're going to start knocking you out.
[01:49:35.774 --> 01:49:39.384]  Because they're going to enjoy all the life extension, all the great technologies.
[01:49:40.091 --> 01:49:50.833]  This War on Terror is about more and more terror, worse and worse, herding us into more and more compact, controlled cities, exterminating, exterminating, and always, you didn't give us enough control, exterminate, exterminate.
[01:49:51.153 --> 01:49:56.695]  The boogeyman keeps getting ya, gotta get rid of more of ya, gotta arrest more people, you're all behind it.
[01:49:57.315 --> 01:50:06.757]  Neighbors informing on neighbors, and the more you tattle, the more liberty you give up, the more bio-attacks, the more chemical attacks, the more radiological events you're gonna see.
[01:50:07.577 --> 01:50:10.460]  They're going to do it all from the safety of their armored compounds.
[01:50:12.342 --> 01:50:17.768]  And we're really in trouble in a few years when everything goes mechanized and remote control, which they're almost at that point right now.
[01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:22.393]  Oh man, we're entering a very interesting time.
[01:50:24.035 --> 01:50:29.501]  And once they get their control grid in place, where you've got to thumb scan the behind shell, and they admit the face scanners are everywhere,
[01:50:30.436 --> 01:50:32.637]  RFIDs are in all goods and tracking and tracing us.
[01:50:33.257 --> 01:50:39.078]  And after the secret arrest and people are rounded up and killed, then they'll just start massacring you in an orderly fashion.
[01:50:40.479 --> 01:50:40.879]  And I don't know.
[01:50:40.979 --> 01:50:42.079]  I don't want to let them do that.
[01:50:42.239 --> 01:50:43.279]  So I'm here telling the truth.
[01:50:43.299 --> 01:50:44.700]  And hey, a lot of you won't listen now.
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:46.400]  When they're killing you, you will.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.661]  Maybe at that point you'll resist the only way you can at that point.
[01:50:51.441 --> 01:50:52.562]  And nothing may help you.
[01:50:53.262 --> 01:50:53.842]  It won't matter.
[01:50:54.947 --> 01:50:59.372]  The troops will just be glad that they've got the cure, the vaccine for whatever the globalists have released.
[01:50:59.793 --> 01:51:04.958]  They'll follow orders to, quote, exterminate everyone that has whatever deadly superplug they're going to release.
[01:51:05.819 --> 01:51:07.922]  And it's going to be quite interesting.
[01:51:08.462 --> 01:51:10.685]  And I'm sorry that most of you are going to have to die.
[01:51:10.705 --> 01:51:13.588]  And, well, you know, that's what it is to be in an evil country.
[01:51:13.608 --> 01:51:16.291]  You can die like the 54 million dead children we've aborted.
[01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:19.391]  Now if I haven't freaked you out, something's wrong with you.
[01:51:19.892 --> 01:51:30.598]  Before I end this segment, I hope you will go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and I hope you will get the videos and I hope you'll get them out to people so we can expose these people.
[01:51:31.038 --> 01:51:34.641]  If enough of us wake up now, it may derail this phase of the extermination program.
[01:51:35.681 --> 01:51:37.482]  And yes, the videos are one of the best tools to do it.
[01:51:37.502 --> 01:51:37.562]  1-888-253-3139
[01:51:44.238 --> 01:51:44.738]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:53.565]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, I have mainstream news articles where the elite plan to exterminate us, okay?
[01:51:54.446 --> 01:51:55.947]  Where they have declassified documents.
[01:51:56.828 --> 01:52:00.370]  They've already exterminated and sterilized half the women in the third world.
[01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:01.311]  Official documents.
[01:52:02.232 --> 01:52:05.014]  I mean, this stuff's not... What I'm telling you is true, okay?
[01:52:05.594 --> 01:52:06.635]  I'm sorry it's scary.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.421]  But you might want to wake people up.
[01:52:09.441 --> 01:52:10.822]  You might want to get involved, okay?
[01:52:10.882 --> 01:52:12.463]  Because this is the only chance we've got.
[01:52:12.583 --> 01:52:14.685]  And some of the best tools we have are the videos.
[01:52:14.705 --> 01:52:15.666]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:15.686 --> 01:52:19.869]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:52:20.409 --> 01:52:22.030]  Alright, third hour straight ahead.
[01:52:22.050 --> 01:52:25.052]  I'm going to get back into this PNAC document.
[01:52:35.049 --> 01:52:37.790]  Or they say they want to use very specific bioweapons on you in the near future.
[01:52:38.831 --> 01:52:42.332]  And I want to get to all the other great callers that are patiently holding.
[01:52:43.893 --> 01:52:44.613]  So stay with us.
[01:52:44.633 --> 01:52:46.634]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:52:46.694 --> 01:52:47.594]  Start in the third hour.
[01:52:48.815 --> 01:52:50.755]  And I'll see you tonight in Houston, Texas.
[01:52:53.476 --> 01:52:56.958]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:52:57.218 --> 01:53:00.719]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:53:00.799 --> 01:53:04.741]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed and can be
[01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:11.712]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.298 --> 01:53:19.958]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.598 --> 01:53:21.659]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.540]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:24.981]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.001 --> 01:53:26.663]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.683 --> 01:53:31.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.446 --> 01:53:35.569]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:36.682 --> 01:53:43.205]  Alright, the PNAC document project for the new American century called for terrorist attacks to get the new world order going.
[01:53:44.766 --> 01:53:47.308]  A Pearl Harbor, fortunate Pearl Harbor event.
[01:53:49.989 --> 01:54:00.214]  And they also said that they want to develop weapons that quote, can target specific genotypes and may transform biological warfare from a realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[01:54:00.534 --> 01:54:00.654]  Oh!
[01:54:00.674 --> 01:54:03.716]  I mean these people are just
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:06.722]  Speaking of James Bond movies, remember Moonraker?
[01:54:07.042 --> 01:54:12.706]  Where the crazy Illuminati guy is going to knock out the population of the Earth so he can create his Utopia Society?
[01:54:13.226 --> 01:54:22.112]  Folks, in my film Road to Tyranny, I have the Sydney Morning Herald, I have BBC, I have mainstream articles where the globalists actually plan something like that.
[01:54:23.773 --> 01:54:32.459]  And they get into this quote, they've got a quote here, Worldwide Demand and Control System needs to be in place before they can start the use
[01:54:33.314 --> 01:54:40.195]  of targeted specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror, a politically useful tool.
[01:54:40.595 --> 01:54:52.638]  This is your Christian conservative leaders that want your guns and say they'll sign the assault weapons ban, that say Arnold would make a good president when he's posing for the gay porno mags.
[01:54:52.678 --> 01:54:54.558]  By the way, that picture's now out there, folks.
[01:54:56.878 --> 01:54:59.419]  And says he's for abortion and total gun control.
[01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:00.679]  Oh, it's so good!
[01:55:02.091 --> 01:55:03.072]  Again, just remember that.
[01:55:05.053 --> 01:55:06.173]  Oh man, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:55:06.594 --> 01:55:20.482]  Alright, before we get back into more news, we're talking about the biggest smoking guns of government prior knowledge and involvement in 9-1-1, and the most sickening propaganda you've seen around September 11th with the fake crying of Bush and the rest of it.
[01:55:20.782 --> 01:55:24.104]  Bush saying, hey, Bin Laden's about to resurface, he's gonna get us.
[01:55:24.184 --> 01:55:27.486]  And then an hour after his speech, Bin Laden resurfaces, I'm gonna get ya.
[01:55:28.106 --> 01:55:30.668]  Always, you know, being a good employee of the CIA,
[01:55:32.253 --> 01:55:35.596]  And Bush says you better pass Patriot Act 2 or Bin Laden's going to get you.
[01:55:35.856 --> 01:55:42.341]  So no matter how much you complain, you know, don't worry, Bin Laden's going to keep getting you over and over again until you're good little slaves.
[01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:48.765]  Let's go ahead and talk to, hmm, I wonder who's up next here.
[01:55:50.527 --> 01:55:51.447]  I have no idea.
[01:55:52.608 --> 01:55:53.469]  Meg in Texas.
[01:55:53.509 --> 01:55:54.249]  Go ahead, Meg.
[01:55:54.269 --> 01:55:55.470]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:58.833]  Yeah, we're going to trade our liberty for security, right?
[01:55:59.875 --> 01:56:05.296]  Hey, after the Reichstag firebombing, Hitler said, the terrorists have attacked, we've got to take your rights away.
[01:56:05.316 --> 01:56:07.357]  Oh yeah, it sounds all too familiar.
[01:56:07.657 --> 01:56:19.259]  Listen, I wanted to make a couple of comments from the last callers, and then you'd asked me to call back, and I thought maybe today would be appropriate, about the definition of Molech, and I'll try to be real quick.
[01:56:19.299 --> 01:56:22.319]  Oh, you mean the Christian conservative god that Bush worships?
[01:56:22.379 --> 01:56:24.740]  Right, and Bohemian Grove and what have you.
[01:56:26.405 --> 01:56:28.307]  Lamedica says it's the most evil demon.
[01:56:28.347 --> 01:56:30.448]  If your leaders worship this, you'll be cursed.
[01:56:30.729 --> 01:56:35.973]  They admit they worship Bullock at the Grove, but again, Pat Robertson says forced abortion is good, so you know.
[01:56:36.273 --> 01:56:36.693]  Oh, right.
[01:56:37.114 --> 01:56:46.922]  And I do believe that they are purposely not treating a lot of people with illnesses, and that they're just disposable, especially socioeconomic factors.
[01:56:47.082 --> 01:56:47.963]  Oh, well that's admitted.
[01:56:48.003 --> 01:56:49.444]  The Bioethics Board says so.
[01:56:49.604 --> 01:56:50.685]  Right, right.
[01:56:50.725 --> 01:56:53.067]  Yeah, I happen to be on the rear end of that myself.
[01:56:54.654 --> 01:56:57.316]  You have the definition of the Christian God.
[01:56:57.336 --> 01:56:59.638]  I mean, I don't believe that, but again, I'm a leftist.
[01:56:59.718 --> 01:57:00.338]  I'm pro-gun.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.841]  But this is the new Christian God.
[01:57:03.861 --> 01:57:04.522]  He's called Molech.
[01:57:04.542 --> 01:57:05.242]  He was very loving.
[01:57:05.262 --> 01:57:05.643]  Go ahead.
[01:57:06.023 --> 01:57:06.924]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:06.964 --> 01:57:08.565]  The national God of the Ammonites.
[01:57:08.725 --> 01:57:11.388]  Children were sacrificed in the fire to Molech.
[01:57:12.088 --> 01:57:14.230]  Malcolm is another name for this God.
[01:57:14.710 --> 01:57:20.155]  Malcolm is the name that may be heading up the International Settlement Bank.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.682]  And you know what's so incredible about that definition?
[01:57:51.554 --> 01:58:02.637]  Is that in the ritual that the Christian conservatives, the William Bennett types, they're not doing 1.4 million gambling in a weekend.
[01:58:02.777 --> 01:58:04.318]  That's what they say in the ritual.
[01:58:04.598 --> 01:58:09.279]  They say this is about us not caring, about us controlling, about us dominating.
[01:58:09.319 --> 01:58:09.759]  Stay there.
[01:58:10.759 --> 01:58:12.840]  We'll talk about how we love guns because we're liberals.
[01:58:14.804 --> 01:58:21.606]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:58:21.946 --> 01:58:23.327]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:58:23.527 --> 01:58:25.707]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:58:25.867 --> 01:58:27.948]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:58:28.248 --> 01:58:33.190]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:37.531]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:58:37.791 --> 01:58:39.572]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:58:39.652 --> 01:58:50.298]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:58:50.439 --> 01:58:52.360]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:56.422]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[01:58:56.502 --> 01:58:58.083]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:58.103 --> 01:58:58.643]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:59:14.039 --> 01:59:17.520]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:21.301]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:59:21.381 --> 01:59:25.322]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:59:25.542 --> 01:59:31.703]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:32.103 --> 01:59:40.025]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:40.405 --> 01:59:40.765]  I think so.
[01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:58.992]  $90 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:59:59.032 --> 02:00:05.675]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:00:05.715 --> 02:00:07.416]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:00:14.244 --> 02:00:18.728]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:00:19.088 --> 02:00:23.192]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:00:23.472 --> 02:00:24.013]  We listened.
[02:00:24.333 --> 02:00:29.317]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:00:29.597 --> 02:00:30.078]  We listened.
[02:00:30.458 --> 02:00:33.481]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:00:33.921 --> 02:00:34.462]  We listened.
[02:00:34.922 --> 02:00:38.285]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:00:38.285 --> 02:00:38.625]  I don't know.
[02:01:04.825 --> 02:01:05.786]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:01:05.806 --> 02:01:07.227]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:19.278 --> 02:01:19.918]  Big Brother.
[02:01:20.579 --> 02:01:21.639]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:23.460]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.101 --> 02:01:24.941]  You want answers?
[02:01:25.681 --> 02:01:27.602]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.622 --> 02:01:31.184]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.444 --> 02:01:35.547]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:38.888 --> 02:01:47.613]  The Egyptians built giant pyramids because their fruitcake Luciferian witch doctors told them that if they built a big enough
[02:01:48.607 --> 02:01:51.671]  ...funeral mound that their spirit would live forever.
[02:01:52.191 --> 02:01:53.673]  They didn't want to turn loose of it.
[02:01:56.196 --> 02:02:02.864]  Now we have a real elite in 2003 that has a real chance of having extremely extended lives.
[02:02:03.565 --> 02:02:08.691]  And they believe if they can extend them another 50 years, they can then extend them indefinitely.
[02:02:10.217 --> 02:02:19.283]  Now, this is what Wired Magazine is saying, and Silicon Weekly is saying, and some of their top futurists have been writing in books like Saturn's Race.
[02:02:22.004 --> 02:02:23.465]  This is what they're up to, folks.
[02:02:23.525 --> 02:02:28.128]  I mean, now I'm seeing it in CNN, and in little hints here and there.
[02:02:28.148 --> 02:02:31.310]  I'm seeing an article, where is thy sting getting into this?
[02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:37.994]  And when they come up with all these enzyme treatments and all of this cell regeneration and cloning and getting parts from it,
[02:02:39.026 --> 02:02:58.440]  None of the real advances are given to the people, and the globalists say that they brag now, in major publications, that, well, we're going to keep this for the elite, and there will be a parallel system of technology developed, old Joy wrote of some microsystems, and you'll be kept under that at your suboid level, you'll be watching football, and
[02:02:59.105 --> 02:03:12.021]  You know, but living in your little inner city compact control grid because of the terrorists, you won't be able to leave outside that into the controlled safe zones where the crops are grown, you know, by big agribusiness after the bio-attack on the food.
[02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:37.865]  See, as the technology increases, it'll empower all this, where they have to take over all the outside areas, and no matter how much liberty we give up, the attacks are going to get worse and worse, and smaller and smaller numbers of us, and more and more compact cities, and licenses to have children, and one-child policies, and everything tried to control the THX 1138 Brave New World system.
[02:03:39.126 --> 02:03:39.846]  It's already here.
[02:03:39.866 --> 02:03:41.367]  It's not coming, it's here.
[02:03:42.108 --> 02:03:43.249]  This is their official plan.
[02:03:43.329 --> 02:03:49.971]  And then I'm reading the PENAC document, rebuilding America's defenses, that's getting all the attention that Ron Paul was talking about.
[02:03:50.651 --> 02:03:54.493]  And again, he's for low taxes, border control, Second Amendment, he's a socialist.
[02:03:55.293 --> 02:04:01.336]  If you're for massive taxes, you know, you run around with red flags in your hands, you're founded by Trotskyites, you're a conservative.
[02:04:01.636 --> 02:04:04.317]  I'm learning, see, I'm learning the new definitions.
[02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:13.773]  He talked about PNAC, but I'm reading one of the PNAC documents and it talks about race-specific viruses that they're going to use on certain races of people.
[02:04:14.714 --> 02:04:20.436]  And it says here, after they have their quote, worldwide command and control system in place.
[02:04:21.817 --> 02:04:23.258]  That's all this is about, folks.
[02:04:23.978 --> 02:04:27.480]  Getting rid of the last few rogue nations, whether they're good guys or bad guys that run them.
[02:04:29.381 --> 02:04:32.222]  Getting us our national ID cards, then launching some more terror.
[02:04:32.622 --> 02:04:34.143]  Getting us more herd into the cities.
[02:04:35.262 --> 02:04:40.785]  While leaving the borders wide open, while you're internally asking for permission to go out at night, the borders are going to be gone.
[02:04:42.046 --> 02:04:42.886]  Except all this.
[02:04:43.987 --> 02:04:50.510]  And so I just, again, I've been on the air for coming up on ten years, eight years on radio, ten years on TV.
[02:04:51.331 --> 02:04:57.354]  I want all of you, all of you, to remember years from now what I've told you.
[02:04:57.614 --> 02:04:59.575]  Those that just can't get it right now.
[02:04:59.635 --> 02:05:01.636]  You can't read the globalist on policy reports.
[02:05:01.856 --> 02:05:02.977]  You're just not going to do it.
[02:05:03.959 --> 02:05:08.521]  You're gonna go, Boy, I tell ya, I just don't know what to do about Bush.
[02:05:08.561 --> 02:05:13.103]  He just don't mean it that he's going after our guns and our borders and our everything else.
[02:05:13.143 --> 02:05:14.283]  He just can't help it.
[02:05:15.964 --> 02:05:24.287]  Boy, I tell ya, I wish I... Boy, I wish... I heard about Alex Jones and I just can't believe it.
[02:05:24.908 --> 02:05:26.708]  We can't let Hillary get in there.
[02:05:26.788 --> 02:05:28.489]  I'm gonna have to vote for Bush again.
[02:05:28.969 --> 02:05:30.550]  You aren't voting.
[02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:32.971]  There's no voting anymore.
[02:05:33.846 --> 02:05:34.907]  Give me a break!
[02:05:35.187 --> 02:05:37.928]  We've got to be honest about how bad things are, folks.
[02:05:38.408 --> 02:05:40.449]  And just totally deny this false system.
[02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:42.530]  You don't believe me?
[02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:43.831]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:43.871 --> 02:05:46.752]  It's come out that the CIA runs the touchscreen companies.
[02:05:46.912 --> 02:05:48.393]  They've caught them red-handed, okay?
[02:05:49.434 --> 02:05:52.815]  Let's go ahead and... Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[02:05:52.835 --> 02:05:54.856]  I was talking to Megan in Texas.
[02:05:54.996 --> 02:05:58.818]  She called in with a Bible passage.
[02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:02.300]  Not actual scripture, but you know, the analysis of words and the concordance.
[02:06:03.382 --> 02:06:10.329]  You go to the dictionary or encyclopedia, and they've got the same definition for Moloch, you know, this evil demon that suppresses and dominates you.
[02:06:11.050 --> 02:06:12.471]  And they sacrifice kids to it.
[02:06:12.491 --> 02:06:22.200]  And I snuck into the Bohemian Grove three years ago, and I shot the video of the ritual, and the Bohemian Grove Club said in the Trio Network documentary that, yes, I did get the vinegar, and yes, that's their ritual, but so what?
[02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:25.604]  And this is where most of your Christian leaders go.
[02:06:25.624 --> 02:06:27.746]  And they're really Satan worshipers.
[02:06:28.425 --> 02:06:29.927]  And no wonder things are getting so bad.
[02:06:29.947 --> 02:06:31.548]  No wonder they're not getting rid of abortion.
[02:06:31.949 --> 02:06:33.310]  No wonder things are going downhill.
[02:06:34.048 --> 02:06:41.975]  Pat Robertson said forced abortion is what China has to do, and I was criticized for reading his quote on CNN and saying it was wrong.
[02:06:42.436 --> 02:06:44.658]  See, I'm bad for standing up for the babies.
[02:06:45.038 --> 02:06:46.760]  I'm bad for standing up for the Second Amendment.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:52.885]  And I'm bad for saying Mr. Bennett is a gambler running around with prostitutes when it's in the news.
[02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:54.406]  Well, let him do it!
[02:06:54.927 --> 02:06:55.267]  Let him!
[02:06:55.307 --> 02:06:56.689]  It's a Christian thing!
[02:06:57.269 --> 02:06:59.131]  You people are sick jellyfish!
[02:06:59.691 --> 02:07:00.491]  To believe that.
[02:07:01.152 --> 02:07:03.752]  Go ahead, Meg, read that quote again.
[02:07:03.772 --> 02:07:05.853]  Read that definition of Moloch.
[02:07:06.253 --> 02:07:07.533]  Oh, yeah.
[02:07:08.254 --> 02:07:13.695]  The ruling of public opinion and the mind of the flesh in one's consciousness.
[02:07:14.355 --> 02:07:26.119]  Children being sacrificed in the fire to this God signifies one mentally burning and destroying new ideas by letting fear of or deep regard for what other persons may think.
[02:07:26.219 --> 02:07:26.999]  Public opinion.
[02:07:27.913 --> 02:07:33.218]  And what do they call the ritual at the grove that I videotaped, that I have in my film, Dark Secrets?
[02:07:33.658 --> 02:07:46.390]  They say, we are throwing off the cares, we are getting rid of our conscience, this absolves us of all the things we've done, bring in the sacrifice, and it's a little bound body, and they lay it on the fire and it screams in pain,
[02:07:46.890 --> 02:07:51.292]  Well, folks, it's all based on materialism and the desires of outer man.
[02:07:51.513 --> 02:08:00.617]  It says here, it goes on to say, to rule in one's life to the extent that one refuses or neglects to give place to expression of these new or higher ideas.
[02:08:03.039 --> 02:08:08.121]  It's a celebration of the evil status quo to feed on the people in a predatory fashion.
[02:08:08.422 --> 02:08:12.764]  Now, according to your maps, I noticed from your films, which are great, by the way,
[02:08:13.871 --> 02:08:18.133]  The one caller that was asking, is there any place safe?
[02:08:18.473 --> 02:08:19.774]  Well, it looks like the swamp.
[02:08:20.894 --> 02:08:23.395]  Folks, I think we're going to have to become swamp people.
[02:08:23.975 --> 02:08:24.296]  You know?
[02:08:24.416 --> 02:08:24.856]  I don't know.
[02:08:25.356 --> 02:08:30.518]  But the Ammonites, the definition of the Ammonites is popular opinion.
[02:08:30.638 --> 02:08:37.221]  Also, the wild and cultivated states of consciousness, thoughts, sensuality, sin, and ignorance.
[02:08:37.845 --> 02:08:39.025]  And you know, so in other words
[02:09:01.798 --> 02:09:06.979]  If the power of good is the constructive center in consciousness.
[02:09:07.319 --> 02:09:12.060]  Well, I tell you, whoever wrote that has a great understanding of the Illuminati.
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:13.281]  Oh yeah, it's an amazing book.
[02:09:13.301 --> 02:09:15.661]  Because that is exactly what they did in that ritual.
[02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:16.301]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:16.681 --> 02:09:16.981]  Yeah.
[02:09:17.462 --> 02:09:18.102]  I appreciate it.
[02:09:18.422 --> 02:09:19.102]  Good to hear from you.
[02:09:19.162 --> 02:09:20.002]  John in Florida.
[02:09:20.042 --> 02:09:20.782]  Go ahead, John.
[02:09:23.023 --> 02:09:24.343]  Rabbit, Firestarter.
[02:09:24.363 --> 02:09:26.444]  It's been a while since I've spoken to you.
[02:09:26.624 --> 02:09:27.404]  Well, good to talk to you.
[02:09:27.444 --> 02:09:27.984]  What's on your mind?
[02:09:29.123 --> 02:09:32.980]  I wanted to get through last night when you were live and mention that
[02:09:34.224 --> 02:09:37.345]  I think what you're doing by going down to Houston is the right, great thing there.
[02:09:37.906 --> 02:09:41.367]  Take care though, in transit, back and forth, it's a long way.
[02:09:41.767 --> 02:09:44.368]  I don't care if they kill me when I walk out my front door.
[02:09:44.468 --> 02:09:45.109]  I don't care.
[02:09:45.389 --> 02:09:47.230]  I've heard you say that before, but you know.
[02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.690]  I really don't.
[02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:48.370]  You'd be missed.
[02:09:48.770 --> 02:09:49.831]  You'd be missed by a lot of them.
[02:09:49.851 --> 02:09:54.293]  Man, I'll walk into a studio with nobody here at night, just walk right into dark rooms, I don't even care.
[02:09:54.373 --> 02:09:56.714]  I wish I could get over there, it's just a little too distant for me.
[02:09:56.834 --> 02:09:57.974]  I know, I'm just, I don't care.
[02:09:58.214 --> 02:09:59.475]  I've got power over them.
[02:09:59.995 --> 02:10:03.617]  They can strap me down and cut my arms and legs off and I'm sure I'll scream in pain.
[02:10:03.817 --> 02:10:05.257]  They can knock my teeth out.
[02:10:05.738 --> 02:10:06.158]  Good!
[02:10:06.838 --> 02:10:11.300]  Because I'm a free human being and I love decency and honor and I'm not afraid of them.
[02:10:12.881 --> 02:10:15.742]  Last night on TV I saw something that I wanted to pass on.
[02:10:17.323 --> 02:10:22.425]  Walter Cronkite, the grand old man of the media,
[02:10:23.024 --> 02:10:25.685]  was interviewed by Larry King at the same time.
[02:10:25.925 --> 02:10:29.727]  A member of the Christian organization Bohemian Grove.
[02:10:29.987 --> 02:10:34.409]  His daughter was on local radio just a few months ago and I called into the show.
[02:10:34.429 --> 02:10:35.210]  It was on my station.
[02:10:35.250 --> 02:10:36.230]  I'm on until 6 a.m.
[02:10:36.250 --> 02:10:37.691]  and I said... Yeah, she lives down there, right?
[02:10:37.911 --> 02:10:38.711]  Yeah, she lives down here.
[02:10:38.811 --> 02:10:41.993]  And I said to her, I said, your dad likes the rituals there at the Grove.
[02:10:42.013 --> 02:10:42.833]  She goes, oh yes, mm-hmm.
[02:10:43.193 --> 02:10:47.235]  Well, at the same time, Bill Moyer was interviewing
[02:10:48.221 --> 02:10:49.762]  Uh, Henry Kissinger.
[02:10:50.383 --> 02:10:57.408]  And boy, oh boy, I was shocked to hear, like, Walter Cronkite really questioning the Patriot Act and, uh, you know, the Victory Act.
[02:10:57.528 --> 02:11:02.312]  And, uh, also criticizing Bush's deployment of the forces over there in Iraq.
[02:11:02.352 --> 02:11:03.633]  I mean, it was really surprising.
[02:11:03.693 --> 02:11:07.456]  All the while, Henry Kissinger was just saying, we must have this, no, blah, blah, blah.
[02:11:07.996 --> 02:11:13.340]  Wow, you know, I wish people had seen it and really, you know, were able to go between both at the same time.
[02:11:14.261 --> 02:11:14.621]  And, uh,
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.962]  That was most enlightening to see.
[02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:22.848]  But you know, while I've been on hold, I just want to comment on a couple of things that other callers mentioned.
[02:11:23.368 --> 02:11:32.938]  In regards to the tears that Bush shed yesterday, I didn't see that, but didn't Quinn... Well, he sat there and tried to... He goes, I cried, and he just kept trying to squeeze a tear out.
[02:11:33.138 --> 02:11:34.300]  You know, they practiced it.
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:38.124]  They teach them how to do that to remember a puppy that died, or mommy, or...
[02:11:38.664 --> 02:11:40.986]  Didn't Bill Clinton do the same a couple times?
[02:11:41.006 --> 02:11:43.027]  To get the theatrical emotions in the audience?
[02:12:07.668 --> 02:12:13.394]  And something else about the mystical land of Oswin, I hope that caller is still on the programming app out there.
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:33.080]  In the Golden State.
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:46.043]  But I saw something a week or so ago, it was either on the History Channel or maybe it was involved over this past weekend, an interview on Book 2, on C-SPAN 2, Book 2, whatever it's called.
[02:12:47.643 --> 02:12:55.804]  Talking about, I think it was Winford Scott or Zachary Taylor, I don't recall, who laid siege to Mexico City in the war against Mexico.
[02:12:56.484 --> 02:12:59.845]  After we conquered that territory, Congress
[02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:02.510]  Well, they were never there to begin with.
[02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:03.870]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:16.795 --> 02:13:21.799]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:13:22.199 --> 02:13:24.941]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:13:25.402 --> 02:13:28.264]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:13:28.644 --> 02:13:35.790]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:37.191]  That's recovery?
[02:13:37.811 --> 02:13:43.015]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:13:43.416 --> 02:13:44.957]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[02:13:45.635 --> 02:13:48.396]  Hi folks, this is Jack Browner with Midas Resources.

[02:14:15.894 --> 02:14:20.377]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:14:20.738 --> 02:14:24.821]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:14:25.121 --> 02:14:25.681]  We listened.
[02:14:25.981 --> 02:14:30.965]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:14:31.245 --> 02:14:31.726]  We listened.
[02:14:32.126 --> 02:14:35.148]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:14:35.568 --> 02:14:36.109]  We listened.
[02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:40.392]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:14:40.452 --> 02:14:41.032]  I think so.
[02:15:06.471 --> 02:15:07.435]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:15:07.455 --> 02:15:09.101]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:15:14.312 --> 02:15:15.092]  Oh my God!
[02:15:15.353 --> 02:15:20.075]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:15:20.355 --> 02:15:21.015]  Yes, it's true.
[02:15:21.115 --> 02:15:23.796]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:15:23.936 --> 02:15:27.978]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.

[02:15:39.443 --> 02:15:41.544]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[02:15:41.544 --> 02:15:41.924]  I think?
[02:16:03.257 --> 02:16:06.419]  Ambien, Fioraset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.

[02:17:22.088 --> 02:17:24.869]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:17:26.769 --> 02:17:32.670]  You're in a bad position because you can't get your mind around how evil the globalists are.
[02:17:34.451 --> 02:17:38.231]  Again, they're on the nightly news, they're in the sitcoms, the dramas, the new TV show.
[02:17:38.251 --> 02:17:39.911]  Threat Matrix is coming out.
[02:17:40.332 --> 02:17:41.852]  Torturing the daylight side of people.
[02:17:42.172 --> 02:17:44.072]  The good guys now torture people.
[02:17:45.092 --> 02:17:48.813]  So that's a mass mind-warping taking place systematically.
[02:17:50.071 --> 02:17:53.092]  And of course you can say to somebody, well Joseph Mengele tortured it was wrong.
[02:17:53.492 --> 02:17:54.632]  They go, well that was him.
[02:17:54.852 --> 02:17:56.072]  It's good when we do it.
[02:17:56.712 --> 02:17:58.553]  Oh, the North Vietnamese tortured our airmen.
[02:17:58.593 --> 02:18:01.213]  Well, that was bad, but it's good when we do it.
[02:18:01.253 --> 02:18:02.254]  They're on the news.
[02:18:02.314 --> 02:18:03.174]  You've seen them.
[02:18:03.234 --> 02:18:04.114]  You've heard them.
[02:18:05.614 --> 02:18:08.075]  I don't watch more than a couple hours of TV a month now.
[02:18:08.435 --> 02:18:10.695]  Every time I turn it on, it's how good torture is.
[02:18:11.335 --> 02:18:12.556]  I got stacks of videos.
[02:18:12.596 --> 02:18:18.397]  Listeners have sent me of newscasts and dramas and shows where how great the New World Order is, how good torture is.
[02:18:20.515 --> 02:18:21.716]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[02:18:21.756 --> 02:18:23.156]  We've got to warp our minds.
[02:18:23.176 --> 02:18:24.517]  We think all this is acceptable.
[02:18:26.518 --> 02:18:32.581]  Let's go ahead and let's talk to... I guess James in Ohio is up next.
[02:18:32.601 --> 02:18:36.063]  We're talking about the lies of 9-1-1 and the sickening propaganda.
[02:18:36.083 --> 02:18:36.443]  Go ahead.
[02:18:36.463 --> 02:18:37.624]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:18:38.084 --> 02:18:38.364]  Good.
[02:18:38.584 --> 02:18:41.446]  James in Ohio, State Chairman of the Constitution Party.
[02:18:41.486 --> 02:18:43.187]  Hey, thanks for having Ron Paul on, by the way.
[02:18:44.167 --> 02:18:46.128]  Well, we've got to have leftists like that on.
[02:18:46.408 --> 02:18:46.688]  Yeah.
[02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:48.349]  Actually, hey, he'll be in Ohio tomorrow night.
[02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:49.370]  I'm looking forward to meeting him.
[02:18:49.978 --> 02:18:51.458]  I was being sarcastic again.
[02:18:51.578 --> 02:18:52.178]  I know, I know.
[02:18:52.198 --> 02:18:55.279]  I mean, he's pro-gun, pro-border, pro-sovereignty.
[02:18:55.879 --> 02:18:57.300]  He's a liberal.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:00.520]  But, again, a neocon is a good thing.
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:02.661]  A trotskyite, a dirty trotskyite's good.
[02:19:03.721 --> 02:19:04.481]  I know, it's something else.
[02:19:04.541 --> 02:19:07.322]  Hey, why don't you respond to this article in Warnet Daily.
[02:19:07.342 --> 02:19:10.562]  A guy named Paul Sperry wrote a book called Crude Politics.
[02:19:10.582 --> 02:19:11.383]  Have you heard of this guy?
[02:19:11.863 --> 02:19:12.703]  Uh, no.
[02:19:13.763 --> 02:19:18.224]  Well, basically he's saying, yeah, Bush was after the... well, but he didn't have any foreknowledge
[02:19:19.028 --> 02:19:24.632]  The attacks he couldn't possibly have because Rumsfeld was in the Pentagon trying to embody his doubt as Laura Bush was in the Capitol.
[02:19:24.652 --> 02:19:26.493]  I don't think you could respond to that.
[02:19:27.874 --> 02:19:29.075]  How would I respond to that?
[02:19:29.095 --> 02:19:29.436]  Yeah.
[02:19:30.616 --> 02:19:32.057]  Well, I mean, give me a break.
[02:19:32.758 --> 02:19:37.581]  The supposed whatever hit the Pentagon hit right in the area where they're doing repairs on it.
[02:19:39.343 --> 02:19:43.766]  And, you know, Rumsfeld's the big hero and Laura's at the Capitol.
[02:19:43.826 --> 02:19:45.027]  I mean, it's all state.
[02:19:45.962 --> 02:19:52.847]  They were running a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets into downtown New York and D.C.
[02:19:53.687 --> 02:19:55.088]  And that's why NORAD stood down.
[02:19:55.408 --> 02:19:59.131]  Just so happened to be running a drill that day.
[02:19:59.931 --> 02:20:02.353]  Did you understand they were never actually in real danger?
[02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:04.394]  Of course they weren't!
[02:20:05.315 --> 02:20:07.756]  Look, I mean, you asked for the evidence of 9-1-1.
[02:20:07.796 --> 02:20:12.199]  I've had to make two films, write a book, and publish a book to just cover some of it.
[02:20:12.219 --> 02:20:13.060]  But you know what I'm going to do?
[02:20:14.164 --> 02:20:15.264]  I'm going to go to one more caller.
[02:20:15.284 --> 02:20:19.406]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to go over one of the timelines of September 11th and let you decide for yourself.
[02:20:19.526 --> 02:20:19.766]  Okay?
[02:20:20.026 --> 02:20:20.226]  Great.
[02:20:20.547 --> 02:20:21.067]  Thanks for the call.
[02:20:21.087 --> 02:20:21.427]  Thank you.
[02:20:21.747 --> 02:20:22.767]  I've got to move quick here.
[02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:23.808]  Rusty in New York.
[02:20:24.188 --> 02:20:24.868]  Rusty, go ahead.
[02:20:25.188 --> 02:20:25.648]  Or Rudy.
[02:20:27.849 --> 02:20:28.890]  Okay, Mike in Illinois.
[02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:29.470]  You're up next.
[02:20:29.490 --> 02:20:29.970]  Go ahead.
[02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:40.274]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say tonight on CBS News on the Nightline, or not Nightline, but Nightly World News on CBS, they're going to have a thing about Homeland Security.
[02:20:40.314 --> 02:20:42.055]  They showed coming clips about the
[02:20:42.915 --> 02:20:47.738]  You know, Hispanics crossing the borders and it says, are we vulnerable to terrorists crossing through our nation's borders?
[02:20:47.758 --> 02:20:50.559]  So everything is getting blown out and being wide open now, Alex.
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:57.843]  Well, yeah, they just took 5,000 more off the border and said they're going to be the new air marshals.
[02:20:57.863 --> 02:21:01.045]  I mean, we have less border patrol than we did on 9-1-1.
[02:21:01.405 --> 02:21:02.606]  It's a sick joke.
[02:21:02.666 --> 02:21:03.246]  Thanks for the call.
[02:21:03.286 --> 02:21:05.327]  You know what?
[02:21:05.347 --> 02:21:10.030]  I'm not taking any more calls because I want to... I already went over PNAC documents.
[02:21:11.556 --> 02:21:12.497]  But we need to go over this.
[02:21:12.537 --> 02:21:14.658]  There's a lot of different timelines in 9-1-1.
[02:21:16.679 --> 02:21:19.620]  And there's a lot of different facets to it.
[02:21:19.881 --> 02:21:21.942]  And I've got one of the shorter ones here.
[02:21:21.982 --> 02:21:25.264]  It's only about 15 pages long.
[02:21:26.204 --> 02:21:29.786]  And I don't know if it's possible to try to actually read all of this on air.
[02:21:32.147 --> 02:21:34.629]  But it is important.
[02:21:35.749 --> 02:21:38.331]  So I'm going to try to go over this when we get back.
[02:21:41.496 --> 02:21:53.452]  We'll talk about the French Daily Le Figaro reporting that in Dubai Hospital receiving treatment for chronic kidney infection last July, Osama bin Laden met with a top CIA official presumably the
[02:21:54.244 --> 02:22:05.934]  Chief of the Station, the meeting held in Bin Laden's private suite that took place at the American Hospital in Dubai at a time when he was a wanted fugitive for the bombings of two U.S.
[02:22:06.034 --> 02:22:09.457]  embassies in last year's attack on the USS Cole.
[02:22:09.477 --> 02:22:19.165]  Bin Laden was eligible for execution according to a 2000 intelligence finding issued by President Bill Clinton before leaving office in January.
[02:22:20.237 --> 02:22:28.624]  On July 14, 2001, he was allowed to leave Dubai on a private jet and there was no Navy fighters waiting to force him down.
[02:22:29.184 --> 02:22:32.026]  Well, yeah, Bin Laden's family all got flown out with a bunch of other people.
[02:22:32.487 --> 02:22:34.008]  Of course, that's now admitted.
[02:22:35.329 --> 02:22:38.191]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:22:39.352 --> 02:22:44.096]  But I want to try to go over some of the history, just some of the smoking guns.
[02:22:44.116 --> 02:22:46.558]  Maybe I'll go over the timeline in my book.
[02:22:47.618 --> 02:22:48.239]  Just some of the
[02:22:49.668 --> 02:22:50.549]  God, just so much.
[02:22:50.609 --> 02:22:51.430]  Where do you begin?
[02:22:51.470 --> 02:22:52.211]  Where do you end?
[02:22:52.231 --> 02:22:57.055]  I mean, it's just... I mean, it would take months to show this evidence to a jury.
[02:22:57.736 --> 02:23:01.099]  There isn't a jury in the world that wouldn't convict them of carrying out those attacks.
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:03.201]  And then using them to enslave us.
[02:23:05.263 --> 02:23:06.184]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.665 --> 02:23:08.286]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.187 --> 02:23:11.870]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:19.703]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[02:23:19.863 --> 02:23:25.607]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[02:23:25.627 --> 02:23:25.667]  888-803-4438.
[02:23:25.687 --> 02:23:26.408]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:23:26.468 --> 02:23:27.708]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:23:38.806 --> 02:23:44.829]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:45.449 --> 02:23:48.450]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:50.651 --> 02:23:54.253]  Bob Dole's... Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff.
[02:23:55.313 --> 02:23:57.014]  Stanley Hilton's been on this show twice.
[02:23:57.394 --> 02:24:02.056]  He's interviewed over a hundred high-level military officers like Colonel Stephen Butler.
[02:24:04.033 --> 02:24:10.756]  The head of the Defense Language School of Monterey, California, was ordered to train many of the hijackers at the spy school.
[02:24:10.796 --> 02:24:12.517]  These guys are CIA folks.
[02:24:14.377 --> 02:24:18.459]  And he's suing the government for carrying out the attacks, not for having prior knowledge.
[02:24:18.579 --> 02:24:22.301]  The German intelligence groups have said that's what's happened.
[02:24:22.321 --> 02:24:27.623]  The German head of technology, their minister, said there's no way.
[02:24:28.103 --> 02:24:31.765]  There was a press conference in Portugal last year that went on for 70 plus hours.
[02:24:32.498 --> 02:24:37.519]  With hundreds of jet pilots and fighter pilots and former U.S.
[02:24:37.639 --> 02:24:42.621]  colonels and generals saying it's ridiculous, only remote control, on and on and on.
[02:24:44.081 --> 02:24:51.523]  We had David Shippers on, who before September 11th, had detailed information about plans for these planes to be flown into buildings.
[02:24:52.043 --> 02:25:01.666]  As the CIA assets, the so-called hijackers, were going around creating their ledger, their trail, Shippers saw that, the guy that impeached Clinton again,
[02:25:02.704 --> 02:25:04.145]  He went to Ashcroft.
[02:25:04.205 --> 02:25:05.265]  Ashcroft wouldn't stop him.
[02:25:05.305 --> 02:25:10.367]  Bush issued W1999, ordering FBI not to stop Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:12.668 --> 02:25:18.131]  And then the Deputy FBI Director John O'Neill resigned two months before 9-1-1.
[02:25:18.271 --> 02:25:21.952]  They have interviews in England and France saying, quote, the U.S.
[02:25:21.972 --> 02:25:28.955]  government's going to allow massive terror attacks to pretext to invade areas of the Middle East and Central Asia.
[02:25:28.975 --> 02:25:30.576]  This is all in the records, all in the films.
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:38.765]  All the books, all the website, on PrisonPlanet.com we have over 500 mainstream news articles with transcripts and interviews all right there.
[02:25:39.585 --> 02:25:41.147]  InfoWars.com has hundreds.
[02:25:41.607 --> 02:25:41.807]  Go!
[02:25:42.207 --> 02:25:42.788]  Go look at it!
[02:25:44.349 --> 02:25:45.950]  It's like, it's just incredible.
[02:25:47.711 --> 02:25:56.637]  Shippers went to him, I mean, FBI agent Robert Wright just stood up there at the press conference, press club and said, here's the letter, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[02:25:57.578 --> 02:26:02.160]  Larry Klayman stood up from judicial watch and said, all we can say is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:12.005]  You have the motives for the oil, the opium, the weapons sales, the tens of billions of dollars of contracts with no bids allowed, going to just a handful of globalist corporations.
[02:26:12.025 --> 02:26:20.069]  You have the PNAC documents calling for, quote, an attack on the scale of Pearl Harbor for imperial mobilization for a New World Order.
[02:26:20.249 --> 02:26:22.690]  You have the Northwoods, a planned official U.S.
[02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:24.931]  government document for remote-controlled jets
[02:26:25.351 --> 02:26:31.294]  Preferably with young college students on board, saying that killing young people makes the American people more mad.
[02:26:31.314 --> 02:26:34.336]  They talked about committing sniper attacks in D.C.
[02:26:34.356 --> 02:26:42.140]  and Miami, to blame it on their political enemies, how to blow up a ship full of troops, how to kill Marines, and then blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:45.962]  I mean, that's an official plan, green-lighted all the way up to the President!
[02:26:48.143 --> 02:26:51.925]  Baltimore Sun, ABC News, OnInfoWars.com right now.
[02:26:51.965 --> 02:26:54.647]  They just calmly report this stuff and nothing else is ever said.
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:57.141]  The FBI cooked the driver.
[02:26:58.301 --> 02:26:59.001]  Cooked the bomb.
[02:26:59.101 --> 02:26:59.902]  Yeah, cooked the driver.
[02:27:00.942 --> 02:27:01.983]  Cooked up the whole thing.
[02:27:02.963 --> 02:27:03.703]  Made the bomb.
[02:27:04.544 --> 02:27:05.284]  Cooked the bomb.
[02:27:06.084 --> 02:27:06.965]  Trained the drivers.
[02:27:07.265 --> 02:27:10.966]  In the first World Trade Center, a tax source on that, Chicago Tribune.
[02:27:11.406 --> 02:27:12.407]  Tapes were made of it.
[02:27:12.427 --> 02:27:17.149]  Because the informant that did it didn't want to get busted, so he recorded the FBI saying, go ahead and bomb it.
[02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:25.252]  Oklahoma City, with General Parton and all the evidence and the seismographs and the governor and the video of the bombs being removed and
[02:27:26.201 --> 02:27:29.844]  The Iraqis involved, again, who were trained here in the 80s, who were U.S.
[02:27:29.884 --> 02:27:31.345]  government intelligence assets.
[02:27:33.246 --> 02:27:34.907]  And the media's saying, ignore all that.
[02:27:36.588 --> 02:27:38.330]  On and on and on and on and on.
[02:27:38.350 --> 02:27:40.631]  Now let's get into some of the really meaty stuff.
[02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:42.072]  Man, I don't know where to start on this.
[02:27:43.013 --> 02:27:44.394]  I was going to do this today, but...
[02:27:45.464 --> 02:27:49.765]  This is Adam Brzezinski, founder of the Trilateral Commission's book, Grand Chessboard.
[02:27:50.105 --> 02:28:06.569]  To put it in terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geo-strategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.
[02:28:07.535 --> 02:28:19.698]  Moreover, as America becomes an increasingly multicultural society, it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues, except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat.
[02:28:20.659 --> 02:28:32.602]  An attitude of the American people towards the external projection of American power has been much more ambivalent to public support of American engagement in World War II, largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
[02:28:34.213 --> 02:28:38.517]  PNAC says, fortunate Pearl Harbor, we need more fortunate events.
[02:28:39.658 --> 02:28:40.819]  So incredible.
[02:28:41.860 --> 02:28:48.986]  And you have the CIA following the hijackers out of the country, following them back in when the embassy wouldn't let them back in.
[02:28:49.446 --> 02:28:59.074]  They ordered them to and the CIA and FBI agents that got the visas for the supposed hijackers to get back into the country were given record cash bonuses.
[02:28:59.835 --> 02:29:02.317]  The record bonuses of the year for federal bonuses.
[02:29:03.133 --> 02:29:06.623]  The FBI is over-suppressing Robert Wright and others.
[02:29:07.084 --> 02:29:08.809]  They all got record cash bonuses.
[02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:13.097]  Oh man, it's so horrible.
[02:29:13.137 --> 02:29:14.777]  Pentagon mass casualty drills.
[02:29:14.797 --> 02:29:17.799]  The government said they'd never heard of plans to fly planes into buildings.
[02:29:18.619 --> 02:29:24.401]  But at the Genoa, Italy Globalist Summit, just a few months before, they had anti-aircraft guns on the roofs.
[02:29:25.122 --> 02:29:28.203]  Even before July 2001, the government had received multiple warnings.
[02:29:28.223 --> 02:29:30.084]  The Military District of Washington, D.C.
[02:29:30.404 --> 02:29:34.105]  took the warnings of the planes to fly hijacked passengers into New York and Washington, D.C.
[02:29:34.425 --> 02:29:35.486]  landmarks seriously.
[02:29:35.806 --> 02:29:37.687]  The Army Outline News Service reported.
[02:29:37.707 --> 02:29:39.748]  The Army's Online News Service reported.
[02:29:41.508 --> 02:29:52.771]  2000 edition that the Pentagon conducted a mass casualty exercise simulating a terrorist attack in the Pentagon building by a suicide hijacker flying a large passenger jet.
[02:29:53.851 --> 02:30:01.813]  Despite this publicly available record, a Joint Congressional Intelligence Committee conducted a top-bottom whitewash concerning government prior knowledge.
[02:30:01.853 --> 02:30:07.454]  The committee found the government had never even considered the possibility of hijacked airplanes being flown into buildings.
[02:30:08.166 --> 02:30:09.407]  There's a bunch of other examples.
[02:30:09.447 --> 02:30:17.015]  And of course, that morning of September 11, according to the Associated Press, they were running a drill of flying hijacked jets into the New York and D.C.
[02:30:17.055 --> 02:30:17.595]  skyline.
[02:30:19.677 --> 02:30:25.703]  And I had that Times of London reporter on yesterday, and he goes, well, that is true, but I don't have any comment about that.
[02:30:27.754 --> 02:30:34.941]  The next piece of the evidence you are about to hear, as I'm reading out of my book, is the biggest smoking gun of all.
[02:30:34.981 --> 02:30:47.374]  President Bush signed secret national security order W199I, telling FBI agents as well as defense intelligence officers that if they try to stop Al Qaeda, they would be arrested under national security implications.
[02:30:48.735 --> 02:30:50.497]  Newsweek, Ananova,
[02:30:51.761 --> 02:30:53.721]  And, uh, other major papers reported that.
[02:30:53.781 --> 02:30:55.202]  The document is marked secret.
[02:30:55.582 --> 02:30:58.022]  Case ID 199-I-WF-213.589.199.
[02:30:58.042 --> 02:31:04.824]  199 is FBI code for case type.
[02:31:05.244 --> 02:31:06.004]  9 would mean murder.
[02:31:06.024 --> 02:31:07.884]  65 would mean espionage.
[02:31:07.904 --> 02:31:09.685]  199 means national security.
[02:31:10.345 --> 02:31:12.845]  WF indicates Washington Field Office, Special Agents.
[02:31:13.245 --> 02:31:14.806]  We're investigating ABC.
[02:31:15.726 --> 02:31:17.586]  Again, Osama Bin Laden and company.
[02:31:17.946 --> 02:31:20.907]  Because of his relationship with the World Assembly of Muslim Youth,
[02:31:21.781 --> 02:31:22.927]  He goes on and on.
[02:31:22.967 --> 02:31:24.414]  We're blocked from investigating him.
[02:31:25.430 --> 02:31:28.132]  The leaked document came out on BBC News at night and is now admitted.
[02:31:57.152 --> 02:32:18.751]  FBI Director John O'Neill, untimely demise, again, blew the whistle on that, and it says this is out of the London Independent, May 25, 2002 reported, before leaving, O'Neill shared his grievances with the French authors, who were his secret police officers, in Bin Laden, The Forbidden Truth, published last November,
[02:32:19.523 --> 02:32:25.567]  They recount O'Neill's claim that his probe of Mr. Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan had been blocked by the U.S.
[02:32:25.687 --> 02:32:26.208]  oil lobby.
[02:32:26.248 --> 02:32:27.409]  John O'Neill was right.
[02:32:27.849 --> 02:32:29.410]  He paid for his judgment with his life.
[02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:31.892]  The Bush-Bin Laden family connection.
[02:32:32.752 --> 02:32:43.160]  And I have the Daily Mail, the Wall Street Journal, all the dates right here in my book, bibliographed, where it says that in 76 he founded his company with Osama Bin Laden and Salim Bin Laden.
[02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:47.182]  They brought him, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, to Texas in 97.
[02:32:49.964 --> 02:32:55.106]  And, uh, even before September 11th, the Wall Street Journal had called for Bush family to end the relationship with the Bin Ladens.
[02:32:56.106 --> 02:32:58.027]  Again, we have all that bibliographed right here.
[02:32:59.288 --> 02:33:02.569]  And again, Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch said, we've been threatened with arrest.
[02:33:02.589 --> 02:33:03.669]  We tell you what we know.
[02:33:03.769 --> 02:33:07.130]  We can just tell you the Bush's vacation with Mr. Bin Laden, with the Bin Ladens.
[02:33:07.631 --> 02:33:10.092]  The Carlisle Group, oil, opium, and bombs.
[02:33:10.132 --> 02:33:11.372]  And we get into Carlisle Group.
[02:33:11.872 --> 02:33:16.634]  Just busy buying up radio and TV stations in one of the muscle groups behind Clear Channel.
[02:33:18.687 --> 02:33:26.350]  And it gets into all the different things they're doing and how they're involved with Bin Laden and BCCI and all of this.
[02:33:27.090 --> 02:33:33.132]  Here's an article from 1997, BBC headline, Representatives of the Taliban are in Texas visiting the headquarters of Unicole.
[02:33:34.913 --> 02:33:37.514]  And then I get into the buildings collapse.
[02:33:37.554 --> 02:33:39.374]  Building 7 wasn't even hit by an aircraft.
[02:33:39.655 --> 02:33:46.037]  It fell faster than a bowling ball would fall from that many stories.
[02:33:47.432 --> 02:33:47.652]  I think?
[02:34:00.925 --> 02:34:02.446]  Pre-warnings to public officials.
[02:34:02.486 --> 02:34:09.732]  September 12, 2001, San Francisco Chronicle reported that Mayor Willie Brown was warned by federal government not to fly on September 11th.
[02:34:09.832 --> 02:34:15.036]  Salman Rushdie, The Times of London admitted, and they called the FAA, and the FAA said yes for his safety.
[02:34:15.296 --> 02:34:20.220]  He was banned from flying in New York for the month of September, and that was September 3rd.
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:24.283]  Salman Rushdie, author of the Satanic Verses, got a warning from U.S.
[02:34:24.303 --> 02:34:25.504]  authorities not to fly.
[02:34:25.524 --> 02:34:28.947]  They went so far as to ban him from air travel.
[02:34:28.967 --> 02:34:30.508]  The FAA admits on record that they
[02:34:31.218 --> 02:34:43.621]  took this action, and that's the Times of London's September 27, 2001, Rushdie's air ban is the key word, key term, you want to pull that article up.
[02:34:45.062 --> 02:35:00.446]  Warnings from abroad, the Egyptians, the Israelis, the Germans, the French, everybody warned us that it was about to happen, because they were getting the background chatter of the CIA agents, the so-called hijackers, as they went around creating their ledger, creating their background.
[02:35:02.378 --> 02:35:04.759]  And there's just page after page of warnings from abroad.
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:07.001]  Flight school warnings.
[02:35:07.721 --> 02:35:13.945]  Again, you had all these different FBI agents with specifics of the plans to fly planes into the World Trade Center.
[02:35:14.025 --> 02:35:16.106]  Specifically, memos to the White House.
[02:35:16.146 --> 02:35:17.467]  And all they got back was W1999.
[02:35:18.448 --> 02:35:20.429]  You'll be arrested if you say anything.
[02:35:20.649 --> 02:35:22.970]  Bill Clinton had three chances to arrest bin Laden.
[02:35:24.011 --> 02:35:26.132]  All these different times they could kill him.
[02:35:26.192 --> 02:35:31.956]  A special forces colonel was quoted in the BBC as saying they had bin Laden in their sights multiple times and weren't allowed to kill him.
[02:35:34.239 --> 02:35:40.526]  They flew out 8,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda to safety in the middle of the so-called Afghan war and paid them in gold bars.
[02:35:40.866 --> 02:35:43.910]  Fox News admitted that and said it was a CIA accident.
[02:35:45.111 --> 02:35:51.879]  And yeah, Pakistan's our ally and bin Laden's doing television tapings from Pakistan saying he's going to get us right when Bush needs him.
[02:35:53.821 --> 02:35:59.302]  Again, eye in the sky, we've got Extra Long with all their keywords, software listening, saying they didn't know what was going on.
[02:35:59.382 --> 02:36:02.163]  All the different agents that came forward to stand up against the corruption.
[02:36:02.683 --> 02:36:04.843]  Colonel Stephen Butler coming forward and all the rest.
[02:36:05.263 --> 02:36:07.884]  The $7 million lawsuit by Attorney Stanley Hilton.
[02:36:09.204 --> 02:36:13.545]  Protecting the Taliban, you're saying, hey, wait a minute, what was that whole war about?
[02:36:14.545 --> 02:36:16.566]  We went in there and took out the Taliban, right?
[02:36:16.666 --> 02:36:18.406]  No, the military escorted a couple
[02:36:19.439 --> 02:36:23.042]  100 goat herders to torture them publicly at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay.
[02:36:23.422 --> 02:36:32.409]  The real leadership of Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the few that were left in Afghanistan when the war started, were flown out to safety and paid in gold bars in Pakistan by the U.S.
[02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:33.190]  federal government.
[02:36:33.930 --> 02:36:35.531]  Source, Times of London, January 21st, 2002.
[02:36:36.092 --> 02:36:36.752]  U.S.
[02:36:37.573 --> 02:36:38.954]  let Taliban men escape.
[02:36:38.994 --> 02:36:39.775]  Yeah, flew them out by C-130.
[02:36:40.894 --> 02:36:51.979]  It's like that Reuters article that Dr. Stan Monteith likes to read about that the Special Forces Colonel had got Taliban al Qaeda surrounded, all of a sudden a fleet of like a hundred black helicopters shows up, U.S.
[02:36:51.999 --> 02:36:53.840]  helicopters, and picks them up and flies them out.
[02:36:54.101 --> 02:36:55.661]  That's Reuters, people!
[02:36:57.442 --> 02:36:59.823]  Conspiracy fact, folks.
[02:37:00.564 --> 02:37:01.984]  This stuff is going on.
[02:37:02.004 --> 02:37:04.426]  And, of course, there's the David Chippers interview that I did.
[02:37:05.866 --> 02:37:09.068]  There's just all the countless pieces of evidence.
[02:37:10.797 --> 02:37:13.119]  Pakistan's secret police in the airlift of evil.
[02:37:13.139 --> 02:37:14.000]  That's one of the biggest.
[02:37:15.801 --> 02:37:20.745]  And then you have the head of Pakistani intelligence, this general who'd been to the U.S.
[02:37:20.785 --> 02:37:21.666]  twice in his life.
[02:37:21.986 --> 02:37:33.515]  The second time was September 11th, having dinner with George Tenet, head of the CIA, and Porter Goss and Graham, the heads of the intelligence committees, having a meal while the CIA runs a drill of flying planes into buildings.
[02:37:33.815 --> 02:37:36.117]  And Nourad is ordered to stand down for over an hour.
[02:37:37.273 --> 02:37:38.174]  You want to keep going?
[02:37:38.214 --> 02:37:39.595]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:37:39.635 --> 02:37:42.678]  I haven't even gotten to the real meat of all this.
[02:37:42.698 --> 02:37:46.682]  Let's not do any background on September 11th.
[02:37:46.722 --> 02:37:47.883]  We're running out of time.
[02:37:47.923 --> 02:37:51.206]  Let's just cover it from September 11th.
[02:37:55.632 --> 02:37:56.913]  Well, let's go from September 7th.
[02:37:56.933 --> 02:37:58.294]  September 7th, 2001.
[02:37:58.374 --> 02:38:11.425]  Florida Governor Jeb Bush signs a two-year emergency executive order making new provisions for the Florida National Guard to assist law enforcement and emergency management personnel in the event of a large civil disturbance, disaster, or acts of terrorism.
[02:38:11.465 --> 02:38:11.765]  Sorts.
[02:38:12.105 --> 02:38:15.868]  State of Florida website listing governor's executive orders and the Associated Press.
[02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:17.290]  September 6th and 7th.
[02:38:19.125 --> 02:38:22.247]  Put options, a speculation that stock will go down, totaling $4,744.
[02:38:23.728 --> 02:38:26.891]  Record levels are purchased on the United Airlines stock.
[02:38:27.371 --> 02:38:31.314]  Opposed to only 396 call options, speculation that stock will go up.
[02:38:31.754 --> 02:38:34.736]  This is a dramatic and abnormal increase in sales of options.
[02:38:35.277 --> 02:38:40.261]  Many of the United puts are purchased through Deutsche Bank, A.B.
[02:38:40.321 --> 02:38:46.185]  Brown, a firm managed by the current Executive Director of the CIA, Buzzy Kromgaard.
[02:38:48.064 --> 02:38:50.485]  That source on that's Reuters and everything else.
[02:38:50.945 --> 02:38:58.287]  September 10th, put options totaling $4,516 are purchased on American Airlines as compared to $748, all options.
[02:38:59.287 --> 02:39:06.128]  September 6th and 11th, no other airlines show any similar trading patterns to those experienced by United American.
[02:39:06.549 --> 02:39:10.230]  The put options purchased on both airlines were 600% above normal.
[02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:16.051]  This at a time when Reuters issued a business report stating airline stocks may be poised to take off.
[02:39:18.553 --> 02:39:28.321]  And, uh, it has been documented the CIA, the Israeli Mossad, and many other intelligence agencies monitored stock trading in real time using highly advanced programs reported to be descended from the PROMIS software.
[02:39:28.361 --> 02:39:32.245]  This is to alert national intelligence services of just such kinds of attacks.
[02:39:32.685 --> 02:39:36.428]  PROMIS was reported to be recently, as June 2001, to be in some of Bin Laden's possession.
[02:39:36.829 --> 02:39:41.933]  As a result of recent stories by Fox, both the FBI and Justice Department have confirmed its use of U.S.
[02:39:41.973 --> 02:39:42.934]  intelligence gathering.
[02:39:43.314 --> 02:39:48.937]  But they didn't think anything of United American having record puts put against them, and when it led back to the U.S.
[02:39:48.977 --> 02:39:50.198]  government, the story was killed.
[02:39:53.660 --> 02:39:59.863]  And, uh, again, September 9th, President Bush is presented with detailed plans for an overthrow of Al Qaeda.
[02:40:01.264 --> 02:40:08.008]  MSNBC, September 10th, 2001, this item was been removed solely at the request of the party previously named in this
[02:40:08.752 --> 02:40:19.815]  It goes on, recent court proceedings which occurred after the news story had cited have indicated that there was no connection between the story listed and it gets all into that Mike Vreeland case.
[02:40:19.835 --> 02:40:21.156]  I'm reading some Rupert stuff.
[02:40:21.736 --> 02:40:30.278]  Continues, according to Newsweek, a group of top Pentagon officials suddenly cancels trip plans for the next morning, apparently because of security concerns.
[02:40:30.718 --> 02:40:32.699]  September 10th, source of Newsweek, September 24th.
[02:40:33.917 --> 02:40:47.062]  September 10, 2001, Houston Chronicle reports the FBI was notified of a 5th grader from a Dallas suburb who told his teacher tomorrow World War III will begin in the United States and the United States will lose.
[02:40:47.603 --> 02:40:53.965]  The Chronicle was unclear on specifically when the Garland Texas School District officials told the FBI about the incident.
[02:40:57.105 --> 02:41:01.387]  Problem is, folks, I'm reading like a half page of this, and I've got like five different timelines.
[02:41:01.467 --> 02:41:08.190]  My timeline, other people's timelines, and I've got stacks of mainstream news articles on each one of these points that I've read dozens of times on air.
[02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:16.933]  I have just 500-and-something links on Prison Planet, hundreds of links on InfoWars, government ministers saying the same thing we're saying, just wall-to-wall evidence.
[02:41:16.953 --> 02:41:17.753]  It's ridiculous!
[02:41:20.274 --> 02:41:22.395]  I can't even get to September 11th itself.
[02:41:22.595 --> 02:41:25.737]  I can't even get to the date of the attack and what happened there.
[02:41:27.939 --> 02:41:29.661]  Oh, I'll try to get to some of them when we get back.
[02:41:29.741 --> 02:41:31.783]  It's just... It's unbelievable.
[02:41:31.823 --> 02:41:33.885]  You better research this for yourself, please.
[02:41:36.147 --> 02:41:40.491]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.672 --> 02:41:45.096]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.256 --> 02:41:49.640]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:51.002]  The New World Order.
[02:41:51.802 --> 02:41:52.703]  Panama.
[02:41:52.783 --> 02:41:57.006]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.066 --> 02:42:04.012]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:04.132 --> 02:42:06.194]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.394 --> 02:42:16.942]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.142 --> 02:42:18.063]  If you want to understand

[02:44:07.166 --> 02:44:11.891]  The 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains nearly 1 million words of text.
[02:44:12.211 --> 02:44:17.436]  No other book even comes close and most of the information in this publication is not available anywhere else.
[02:44:17.997 --> 02:44:19.258]  Take the guesswork out of your next
[02:44:19.258 --> 02:44:21.118]  Alright, you know what I'm gonna do tomorrow?
[02:44:50.814 --> 02:45:11.405]  I gotta leave here and drive to Houston and do my little speech there and there, Road to Tyranny and THX 1138, the Alamo Draft House, the Western Oaks Shopping Mall, and Western Houston got maps and details and info wars dot com right now and prison planet dot com, but tomorrow I'm just not going to take calls.
[02:45:11.665 --> 02:45:12.065]  That's it.
[02:45:13.126 --> 02:45:14.507]  I am going to get all my notes.
[02:45:14.887 --> 02:45:15.127]  I'm going to
[02:45:16.095 --> 02:45:19.837]  Try to drive back and get back by about 9 o'clock in the morning tomorrow from Houston.
[02:45:19.857 --> 02:45:20.698]  I'm going to go dig out.
[02:45:20.718 --> 02:45:26.561]  I got giant files that I use in the films that are, some of them are about a foot thick and are just busting open with news articles.
[02:45:28.262 --> 02:45:33.706]  And I'm going to go back over these four or five timelines I got in front of me and just pick three hours of stuff.
[02:45:33.746 --> 02:45:35.707]  And I've done this before, four or five other times.
[02:45:36.477 --> 02:45:38.998]  I'll just read and cover stuff calmly.
[02:45:39.038 --> 02:45:39.879]  It takes real focus.
[02:45:39.939 --> 02:45:40.959]  It's very exhausting.
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:44.041]  I can just, it's easy to fly off the handle and go in a hundred directions.
[02:45:44.521 --> 02:45:46.582]  And I will just sit here, because I got folders.
[02:45:46.842 --> 02:45:47.763]  They're in a storage building.
[02:45:47.783 --> 02:45:48.723]  I go to the storage building.
[02:45:49.864 --> 02:45:50.845]  It's boxes of this stuff.
[02:45:50.885 --> 02:45:52.005]  I'll bring the boxes in here.
[02:45:52.986 --> 02:45:56.788]  And I will sit there and I will go, because I've got the files in certain things.
[02:45:57.208 --> 02:45:58.869]  Prior knowledge, proving that.
[02:45:59.269 --> 02:46:00.650]  Government involvement, proving that.
[02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:03.071]  CIA, ISI connections, proving that.
[02:46:04.938 --> 02:46:07.300]  Carrying out the attacks, hold folders on that.
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:08.962]  Motives, hold folders on that.
[02:46:12.004 --> 02:46:13.706]  It's just, it has to be done.
[02:46:13.806 --> 02:46:19.531]  General Mahmoud of the ISI, friend of Mohammed Atta, is visiting Washington on behalf of the Taliban.
[02:46:19.871 --> 02:46:26.457]  He's meeting with the Chairman of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Representative Porter Goss and Senator Bob Graham.
[02:46:26.917 --> 02:46:29.239]  Source MSNBC, October 7, 2001, New York Times, February 17.
[02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:36.952]  And again, he's meeting with him, second trip of his life, that morning, 8.30 as it all happens, with the CIA Director.
[02:46:37.832 --> 02:46:45.597]  This is a guy who confirmed, sent $100,000 to Mohammed Addo while he was training at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, source, Pensacola News Journal.
[02:46:46.558 --> 02:46:47.859]  Okay, I just covered a paragraph.
[02:46:47.939 --> 02:46:49.760]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[02:46:52.042 --> 02:46:52.642]  Oh, boy.
[02:46:53.643 --> 02:46:56.645]  And planes, F-16s, standing down for over an hour.
[02:46:58.026 --> 02:47:00.608]  But with Hanes Stewart, the golfer, they're around him in 18 minutes.
[02:47:03.024 --> 02:47:05.845]  And still it goes on and on and on and on.
[02:47:05.885 --> 02:47:07.786]  Then you've got the Northwoods plan, the official U.S.
[02:47:07.826 --> 02:47:10.848]  government document, calling for carrying out just such attacks.
[02:47:12.128 --> 02:47:15.750]  And then yesterday Bush says, you better pass Patriot Act II or the terrorists are going to get you.
[02:47:15.970 --> 02:47:17.051]  Bin Laden's going to be back.
[02:47:17.331 --> 02:47:20.932]  It's been almost two years since the new video, and suddenly a new one's on Al Jazeera.
[02:47:22.153 --> 02:47:23.134]  I'm going to get you.
[02:47:23.154 --> 02:47:28.216]  You know, just like when Colin Powell's before Congress going, Bin Laden is working with Saddam.
[02:47:29.079 --> 02:47:31.641]  And there's a new tape on Al Jazeera TV saying so.
[02:47:31.701 --> 02:47:32.482]  He agrees with us.
[02:47:32.862 --> 02:47:33.683]  And Laudan does.
[02:47:33.763 --> 02:47:34.463]  And they said, wait a minute.
[02:47:35.084 --> 02:47:36.285]  That's not on Al Jazeera.
[02:47:36.385 --> 02:47:37.326]  Al Jazeera hasn't released it.
[02:47:37.346 --> 02:47:38.707]  And he goes, oh, well, they will soon.
[02:47:38.727 --> 02:47:39.668]  Ha!
[02:47:40.508 --> 02:47:42.230]  I mean, it's just sick, folks.
[02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:44.471]  The level of scripting here.
[02:47:45.672 --> 02:47:47.154]  And they lied to you about Patriot Act.
[02:47:47.554 --> 02:47:49.435]  They lied to you about the command and control system.
[02:47:49.876 --> 02:47:51.117]  They lied to you about everything.
[02:47:52.057 --> 02:47:53.318]  You better get Road to Tyranny.
[02:47:53.339 --> 02:47:54.600]  You better get Masters of Terror.
[02:47:54.860 --> 02:47:55.800]  Buy two films on 9-1-1.
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:56.221]  Part 1 and 2.
[02:47:58.419 --> 02:47:59.943]  And you better get the new book.
[02:48:01.584 --> 02:48:11.052]  In the new book I published, Order Out of Chaos, Paul Watson wrote, if you want to understand this folks, the BBC's reported the British were caught blowing up their buildings.
[02:48:11.092 --> 02:48:13.134]  This is now a hundred percent admitted.
