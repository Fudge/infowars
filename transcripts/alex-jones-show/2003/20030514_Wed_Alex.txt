[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.908]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.670]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.391]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:19.212]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:20.673]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:22.334]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:31.241]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:52.217]  Well, my friends, the global government told us that Al-Qaeda, founded publicly by the CIA, used in 99 to attack the Serbs, in 98 to attack the Serbs, led by Bin Laden and CIA forces out of Albania.
[00:00:52.977 --> 00:00:55.479]  They told us they'd be hitting soft targets.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.662]  They told us they'd probably be hitting Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:07.652]  And they don't say that Al-Qaeda operates in Chechnya, but there were bombings there, a large bombing there.
[00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:23.960]  And all of this will increase the power of government across the board and divert and distract you from the plunging dollar, the trade deficit that's at all-time highs, and this global government that is metastasizing all over the planet.
[00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.482]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up.
[00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:29.823]  We've got a London Independent writer
[00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.792]  Robert Fisk, he's also a photographer.
[00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:38.098]  He was in, one of the unembedded reporters, in Baghdad and all over the Middle East.
[00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:42.964]  And we'll talk about mowing down protesters like Tiananmen Square almost every week.
[00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:47.049]  We'll talk about what really got bombed and what really went on over there.
[00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:48.932]  That's in the next hour.
[00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:57.919]  In about thirty minutes, another tragic story of out-of-control police cops shoot three dogs while serving a warrant on parking ticket fines.
[00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.840]  And the man, they went ahead and arrested him, and he has a two thousand plus dollar bond.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.162]  And it's outraged people in the community across the board.
[00:02:07.822 --> 00:02:17.425]  And I was doing a local talk show yesterday on Newstalk 1260 at a restaurant, and people were walking up going, that happened in my town, that happened in my neighborhood, that happened
[00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:24.484]  In my area, so it is happening all over the country almost every day that we see it in the news.
[00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:29.746]  So we'll talk about the militarization of police and just this bloodthirsty mentality.
[00:02:30.507 --> 00:02:34.348]  Dirty bomb victims may be shot, the Scotsman's reporting.
[00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.112]  Last year they reported that England plans to lock down their cities if there's any type of bio or radiological attack.
[00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:45.127]  To stop, quote, rioting or panic.
[00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:48.830]  They will set up military checkpoints and mow down masses of people.
[00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.431]  That's the plan here.
[00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.834]  All these top-off exercises are martial law drills.
[00:02:55.214 --> 00:03:00.378]  The government has said in the news that under a red alert you may not be allowed to leave your house.
[00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:03.581]  You'll be considered the enemy if you do.
[00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:11.887]  If you don't have water filters and if you don't have storable foods and if you're not prepared and if you don't have self-defense implements
[00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:14.242]  You're totally insane!
[00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:16.223]  Also, U.S.
[00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:23.088]  and Saudi's sensed attacks were imminent, and we'll get to this report, and there's a bunch of them.
[00:03:23.108 --> 00:03:25.049]  The CIA knew, as usual.
[00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.892]  Justice Department plans to set up gun crime prosecution system.
[00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:31.733]  A massive system.
[00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:33.194]  Any type of gun crime.
[00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.737]  Not committing a crime with a gun, just having a gun you're not supposed to.
[00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:38.898]  They're going to throw the federal book at you.
[00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.560]  You'll get longer than a murderer will, or a kidnapper.
[00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.803]  Also another headline, Firm was a cover for the CIA over there.
[00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:50.384]  Terror cell had recent gun battle with police.
[00:03:51.024 --> 00:03:54.225]  FBI warns of Al-Qaeda fuel bombs in the UK.
[00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:55.846]  Delay?
[00:03:56.286 --> 00:04:01.748]  The House will not extend assault weapons ban despite the fact that Bush is pushing for it.
[00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.469]  I don't buy this for a minute, but we'll cover it.
[00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.591]  Also new policy in Iraq to authorize GIs to shoot looters.
[00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:12.413]  A slumping dollar stirs policy debate.
[00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:18.739]  Central bankers calm on Euro now at $1.30 to the dollar.
[00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.419]  That's the headline.
[00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.819]  I thought it was $1.17.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.441]  Well, Forbes says $1.30.
[00:04:22.882 --> 00:04:23.623]  We'll get to that.
[00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:28.226]  Trade gap widens to $43.5 billion last month.
[00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:30.248]  Folks, that's in one month.
[00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:33.691]  It's over $100 billion a year just with China alone.
[00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:38.155]  They're going to use drones on us and they're not for the borders.
[00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:40.837]  They first announced it six months ago for over your cities.
[00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:44.680]  I have seen drones over Austin where I live.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.662]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:47.983]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:50.043]  Stay with us.
[00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.185]  Big, big show.
[00:04:52.905 --> 00:05:05.495]  Whether you're listening to us at night or during the day or in the morning, depending on what time zone you're tuning in on globally, via the shortwave or internet or satellite, and we blast out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:06.876]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:07.437]  Stay with me.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:18.444]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:23.066]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:32.250]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.032]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:41.396]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:48.401]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:49.554]  What about you?
[00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:55.578]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:05:56.798 --> 00:05:58.619]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:16.507]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:18.207]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:20.608]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:06:20.768 --> 00:06:22.848]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.070]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.411]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:34.453]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:45.185]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:47.208]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:06:47.568 --> 00:06:51.270]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns on the InfoWars.
[00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.951]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.352]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:55.773]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:06:55.793 --> 00:06:56.854]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.785]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[00:07:16.246 --> 00:07:23.371]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:27.634]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[00:07:28.034 --> 00:07:35.400]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:45.090]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.
[00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.094]  A 120 day supply of stabilized oxygen is just $15 post-pay.
[00:07:50.945 --> 00:08:00.852]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your four month supply and get the best oxygen boost available in easy to take droplet form.
[00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:02.733]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.441]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.424 --> 00:08:28.944]  This broadcast is about reality.
[00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:35.886]  It's about the real world.
[00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:39.467]  And we discuss what the power elite do.
[00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:45.065]  How they behave, what their goals are, how they carry out their goals.
[00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:49.370]  We try to smash through the wall of ignorance.
[00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:59.275]  Of the naive out there that really think we have a legitimate government, and I'm not talking about George Bush and Al Gore and the contested election.
[00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:04.579]  I'm talking about the private banks that hijacked our central bank, our currency in 1913.
[00:09:04.699 --> 00:09:08.001]  I'm talking about the War Powers Act in 1933.
[00:09:08.441 --> 00:09:10.983]  I'm talking about the National Security Act in 1947.
[00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:19.849]  I'm talking about the New World Order system, Homeland Security, Patriot Acts 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:41.083]  I'm talking about turning on the television and they're saying every child needs an implantable microchip and you flip to the next channel and yeah, the Pentagon's gonna watch everything you do and there's no discussion of the Fourth Amendment against unlawful search and seizure, against violating our person's papers and effects.
[00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:43.506]  Look around you!
[00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:54.208]  They're setting up the most draconian, controlling, wicked system ever seen on Earth.
[00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.275]  The government is giving itself the power of tyrants.
[00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:23.828]  and doing nothing to stop terrorists leaving our border wide open and telling us brace for massive terror attacks and they're going to have to take all our rights away to keep us safe and then every time I investigate a terrorist attack when the news, when the news behind the news finally comes out it's got global intelligence fingerprints all over it
[00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:28.835]  When I say our government's corrupt and illegitimate, I mean the shadow government.
[00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:30.876]  I mean the groups that they've now announced.
[00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:41.026]  The ultra-secret intelligence arms that are private, run-for-profit, working for the large central banks and their private shareholders.
[00:10:41.647 --> 00:10:47.312]  They are utterly ruthless and cunning, extremely intelligent,
[00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.351]  But they have a weak spot.
[00:10:49.571 --> 00:10:51.393]  They think you're evil like they are.
[00:10:51.473 --> 00:10:53.154]  They think you're cowardly like they are.
[00:10:53.615 --> 00:10:55.577]  They think that you can be manipulated.
[00:10:55.637 --> 00:10:57.318]  They think you'll go along with this.
[00:10:57.758 --> 00:11:07.667]  They think that you'll accept them as your savior, when in truth their plan is to dehumanize you, dumb you down, and make you a willing cog in their system.
[00:11:09.232 --> 00:11:10.633]  Look at the articles I have today.
[00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:11.855]  This is out of the Scotsman.
[00:11:11.895 --> 00:11:14.637]  It's on infowars.com.
[00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:16.339]  Being updated right now.
[00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:20.102]  Dirty bomb victims may be shot.
[00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:30.372]  And our government, the government of England, has said that during emergencies, during red alerts, if we come outside our houses, we'll be considered the enemy.
[00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:34.009]  If we don't follow every order, we'll be shot.
[00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:46.879]  When I saw that Gostin, the head of the Model States Emergency Powers Act push, many states didn't adopt, so they just put it in the Homeland Security package, page 76, the forced inoculation quarantine section.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.982]  When he said in the Detroit Free Press in late 2001 that, quote,
[00:11:53.624 --> 00:12:00.589]  The troops are ready to shoot old women, to shoot your grandmother if she doesn't submit.
[00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:02.510]  I knew we had a problem.
[00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:07.074]  And now they've said that they will shut down all our cities.
[00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:19.763]  Sid Casperson, the head of FEMA up in New Jersey, said in the Gannett News Service that if you leave your house, you'll be the enemy, that your rights, basically all your rights, your basic rights will be stripped to move around and associate.
[00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:23.785]  You will be given your national ID card through your driver's license.
[00:12:23.825 --> 00:12:26.546]  You watch, they'll just announce, now swipe your license.
[00:12:26.686 --> 00:12:28.126]  Oh, it was an ID card.
[00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:29.727]  It was a national ID card.
[00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:30.507]  It's already public.
[00:12:30.787 --> 00:12:32.148]  You already have one in your wallet.
[00:12:32.228 --> 00:12:35.289]  Biometrically controlled in 42 states now.
[00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.431]  It was 38, now it's 42 that are doing it.
[00:12:41.312 --> 00:12:45.053]  The phone scanners are going in the grocery stores, going in the school lunch lines.
[00:12:45.113 --> 00:12:46.674]  The giant prisons are being built.
[00:12:46.694 --> 00:12:48.255]  We're shifting into the new economy.
[00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:49.135]  Ultra-tyranny.
[00:12:50.422 --> 00:12:53.366]  Dirty Bomb Victims May Be Shot!
[00:12:53.926 --> 00:13:02.237]  Police Could Be Forced To Shoot Members Of The Public To Maintain Order In The Event Of A Terrorist Dirty Bomb Or Biological Attack On Britain.
[00:13:02.337 --> 00:13:03.939]  It Was Planned Yesterday.
[00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:09.726]  The Police Federation Annual Conference In Blackpool Was Told That So Few
[00:13:10.854 --> 00:13:22.422]  Officers have been trained to deal with a chemical, biological, nuclear, or radiological strike that they would have to resort to very unsavory, but necessary crowd control.
[00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:28.626]  I want to remind you the Sunshine Project reported last year the declassified documents.
[00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:29.787]  This is what we know.
[00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:38.873]  The helicopters are mounted with spray bottles, knockout gas, that when they used it in Russia killed about a third of those that were hit with it, but it's so-called non-lethal.
[00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:51.644]  They are mounted, the helicopters are ready with the spray canisters in every major city in bivouac units merged with your police with knockout gas to knock cities out.
[00:13:52.424 --> 00:13:56.667]  You know what's going to happen when they fly over the city and spray it full of your safety?
[00:13:57.228 --> 00:13:58.428]  Massive car wrecks.
[00:13:58.769 --> 00:13:59.970]  Massive fires.
[00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:06.534]  They predict that as much as 5% of people will die just falling and hitting their heads.
[00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:08.836]  Instant knockout gas.
[00:14:10.403 --> 00:14:13.024]  People will fall into fire ant beds in the South.
[00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:16.687]  Again, fires will start and burn uncontrollably.
[00:14:17.527 --> 00:14:21.290]  Why are they mounting helicopters with knockout gas?
[00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.071]  Why?
[00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:24.772]  What did we do?
[00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:26.533]  We let you run everything!
[00:14:26.573 --> 00:14:27.874]  We were your slaves!
[00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:37.340]  You still treat us like total trash and are putting garbage in the vaccines and are breaking up the families and got CPS running around grabbing kids nationwide
[00:14:38.317 --> 00:14:42.241]  You're bringing in illegal aliens to join the army and the military.
[00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:45.524]  You want convicted felons now, the Washington Times reported.
[00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:48.006]  They're following a Stalinistic system.
[00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:51.530]  Back to Anglin and the Scotsman article.
[00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.912]  Bob Elder, the chairman of the constables,
[00:14:54.795 --> 00:15:08.141]  The Central Committee did not refer specifically to officers, firemen, civilians, but sources within the organization said it was clear police could have to resort to firearms to stop contamination being spread by fleeing victims.
[00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:12.383]  See, if there's any type of attack, your city will be locked down.
[00:15:12.403 --> 00:15:20.647]  And a lot of the sociologists and people that study cities and crime and human movements
[00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:32.079]  Have said, wait a minute, if there's one smallpox release anywhere in the western hemisphere, you're going to lock down all the cities, lock down all the roads, and shoot anyone that tries to flee.
[00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.279]  They said that here in this country.
[00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:46.183]  The Rocky Mountain News reported a few months ago, and it's in my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, that they've got crematoriums, it said, crematoriums, mass grave centers, mass relocation centers, Newsmax reported it.
[00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:48.452]  Cremators, folks!
[00:15:48.652 --> 00:15:50.433]  Rocky Mountain News!
[00:15:50.974 --> 00:15:53.795]  Crematoriums!
[00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:55.256]  Yes!
[00:15:56.377 --> 00:16:02.221]  To radically re-engineer society overnight into the depths of a police state, and it's all for your safety.
[00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:08.365]  FEMA ready to take over every radio and TV station with their EAS system.
[00:16:09.445 --> 00:16:10.966]  But it'll all be to save you.
[00:16:11.327 --> 00:16:13.868]  And they have said they will shoot you.
[00:16:14.268 --> 00:16:16.450]  And the people have looked and they said, locking down all the cities,
[00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:18.260]  There's no reason to do that.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.983]  Smallpox doesn't even spread by the air.
[00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:22.004]  It spreads by touch.
[00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:23.145]  You just wear a mask and gloves.
[00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:23.806]  You can't get it.
[00:16:24.586 --> 00:16:27.529]  You shut down cities within four to ten days.
[00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.651]  Bedlam is guaranteed!
[00:16:32.314 --> 00:16:34.236]  This will cause a nationwide crisis.
[00:16:34.797 --> 00:16:39.501]  By the way, the Federal Reserve was out again the other day, and so was the Treasury Department, bad-mouthing the dollar.
[00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:41.223]  Our own government.
[00:16:42.196 --> 00:16:44.037]  Greenspan saying the economy's in trouble.
[00:16:44.558 --> 00:16:54.023]  They want it to go down, but they know you won't get mad at the government because they'll have this war on terror conveniently going while they take your pension funds, while they take the veterans' health care.
[00:16:54.403 --> 00:16:55.604]  It's all happening right now.
[00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:59.106]  But that's alright, because you've got a power pride sticker.
[00:16:59.406 --> 00:17:01.288]  You don't know what the flag symbolizes.
[00:17:03.249 --> 00:17:05.030]  You don't know what the flag means.
[00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:08.152]  You don't know what it stands for.
[00:17:08.932 --> 00:17:10.133]  But hey, that doesn't matter.
[00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:15.093]  Do you know how to wave it like a Russian did when Stalin would have a little parade?
[00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:23.402]  And it said, the government had failed to explain how important it would be to keep the public inside a cordoned area after such an atrocity.
[00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:26.285]  Mr. Elder said, this is not about creating mass hysteria.
[00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:27.446]  He said, oh really?
[00:17:27.486 --> 00:17:33.773]  And our government got caught, ABC News, the White House, ordering fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:37.467]  This is not about creating mass hysteria, he said.
[00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:38.888]  This is about the opposite.
[00:17:38.928 --> 00:17:40.469]  The public has the right to know.
[00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:46.154]  The natural reaction from the public caught up in such an incident would be to get as far away from the scene as possible.
[00:17:46.535 --> 00:17:49.537]  This could, of course, only extend the problem.
[00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:58.785]  In another reference to the possible use of firearms to keep control of an area, Mr. Elder added, we will be the ones who would have to carry out
[00:17:59.449 --> 00:18:05.413]  The containment and we would be the ones all responsible for our actions whatever those may be.
[00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:07.875]  Now let me tell you about England.
[00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:13.699]  The New World Order, one of the major capitals, is based in the city of London within London.
[00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:14.339]  Two cities.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.880]  The city of London within London.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.621]  The old city.
[00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:19.943]  Totally owned by the Rothschilds and the British Royal Family.
[00:18:21.804 --> 00:18:26.608]  They're the shareholders publicly in this system and three years ago
[00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:31.965]  Over three years ago now, we have a foot-and-mouth section on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:34.027]  Very deep in the archives.
[00:18:34.047 --> 00:18:35.808]  Just type foot-and-mouth and you'll get the archive.
[00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:40.912]  And it came out in Scott Television, Times of London, all of it.
[00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:46.896]  Just calmly announced, yes, the British government released foot-and-mouth from Horton Down Bioweapons Lab.
[00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:49.778]  It, quote, accidentally got released.
[00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:52.320]  Now this was calmly reported like it was no big deal.
[00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:56.543]  I've been on national British radio shows and brought this up and they go, ah, so what?
[00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:57.144]  It's an accident.
[00:18:57.842 --> 00:18:58.542]  They released it.
[00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:01.945]  It showed up in like 12 places simultaneously in one day.
[00:19:02.425 --> 00:19:03.886]  From Scotland to Ireland.
[00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:08.128]  The government came in and killed, I don't know, what, 4 million cows, 8 million sheep.
[00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:11.750]  99.9999% of them didn't have foot and mouth.
[00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:15.733]  And I predicted, I said, they're not going to let them restock cows and sheep on these ancient farms.
[00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:22.077]  And the health minister and environmental minister came out and said, you know, the flatulence from these animals has hurt the ozone.
[00:19:22.797 --> 00:19:24.618]  And the runoff from them hurts the streams.
[00:19:24.658 --> 00:19:25.779]  We're not going to let you restock.
[00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:30.902]  And now they've blown out most of the farming families and are forcing them into the compact control grid city.
[00:19:32.183 --> 00:19:34.885]  And they've said that, oh don't worry, foot and mouth will hit America.
[00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:36.586]  We're going to have to kill most your cows and sheep.
[00:19:36.606 --> 00:19:37.867]  We're going to shut down all the cities.
[00:19:37.908 --> 00:19:43.953]  And they've passed martial law provisions in the last two years in about 25 of the farming states and ranching states.
[00:19:45.234 --> 00:19:46.335]  And it pops up.
[00:19:46.395 --> 00:19:50.118]  It says farming families nationwide won't be able to leave their homes.
[00:19:50.718 --> 00:19:54.982]  They've got all these different scenarios just suddenly where you can't leave your house.
[00:19:55.886 --> 00:19:56.507]  Don't worry.
[00:19:56.887 --> 00:19:59.969]  The troops, the multinational troops they've hired, they've said it.
[00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.672]  In a terror attack, the Mexican troops will be needed.
[00:20:04.153 --> 00:20:05.153]  It's all official.
[00:20:05.214 --> 00:20:07.455]  The Canadian troops are involved in Top Off, too.
[00:20:10.057 --> 00:20:10.818]  Are you prepared?
[00:20:10.998 --> 00:20:13.400]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.044]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:20:18.344 --> 00:20:21.827]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[00:20:22.047 --> 00:20:24.188]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:28.892]  Jerry Deddy from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[00:20:29.132 --> 00:20:32.054]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[00:20:32.174 --> 00:20:39.259]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:44.783]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[00:20:45.063 --> 00:20:50.067]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[00:20:50.287 --> 00:20:51.308]  Jerry can help here too.
[00:20:52.128 --> 00:20:56.793]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:20:57.033 --> 00:21:00.937]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[00:21:01.077 --> 00:21:02.999]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free, 1-800-255-1912.
[00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:04.060]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:16.044]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:16.384 --> 00:21:20.486]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:21.326]  We listened.
[00:21:21.626 --> 00:21:26.608]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:27.368]  We listened.
[00:21:27.748 --> 00:21:30.790]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.770]  We listened.
[00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.252]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:37.493 --> 00:21:42.717]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:44.519]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:44.859 --> 00:21:52.246]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:21:52.626 --> 00:21:56.710]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at
[00:22:01.818 --> 00:22:09.143]  My husband has been on Vim and Vigor for four months and he has lost 33 pounds and I have lost 36 pounds and I'm just thrilled to death about this.
[00:22:20.504 --> 00:22:23.586]  With collagen aid from Vim and Vigor, I've lost 20 pounds.
[00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:27.348]  My cholesterol went from 206 to 131.
[00:22:27.748 --> 00:22:28.749]  My body fat's down by 10%.
[00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:30.630]  And that's been in two months.
[00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:31.451]  And I feel great.
[00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:34.673]  I've been a fitness expert for 20 years.
[00:22:34.993 --> 00:22:36.954]  I've never endorsed anything.
[00:22:37.034 --> 00:22:38.475]  I've never pushed anything.
[00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:41.698]  I'm totally sold on collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:43.019]  It's totally natural.
[00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:52.708]  It has improved my hair, my skin, weight loss, sleep, my energy level is back like it was when I was 20, and recovery time has improved.
[00:22:53.008 --> 00:22:53.709]  Call right now at
[00:22:53.989 --> 00:22:55.791]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:59.314]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:22:59.394 --> 00:23:04.019]  Remember, $25 off a three-month supply, but you gotta call Vim and Vigor now.
[00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:05.580]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:06.601]  Hey, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:13.908]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:18.733]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:23:19.253 --> 00:23:24.139]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:26.281]  The Declaration in Washington D.C.
[00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:27.342]  can barely be read.
[00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:28.604]  It has faded that much.
[00:23:28.964 --> 00:23:32.869]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:23:33.129 --> 00:23:34.070]  We bring them to you by using
[00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:41.473]  Using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:49.596]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:53.837]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[00:23:53.897 --> 00:23:56.198]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.
[00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:59.479]  Call now toll-free 800-686-2237 and order the Documents of Freedom.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.422]  Don't wait, do it today!
[00:24:03.762 --> 00:24:04.203]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:46.403]  I've got the press release here from the City Councilwoman in Allentown, where the police went to a house without a warrant for parking tickets with a SWAT team, militarized, shot three dogs, killed two, and then took the husband to jail with a $2,000 plus bond for parking tickets.
[00:24:50.242 --> 00:24:51.904]  They're not apologizing, nothing.
[00:24:52.444 --> 00:24:54.946]  It's got the whole city up in an uproar, and I'm glad.
[00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.588]  You know, people aren't going to put up with this tyranny.
[00:24:56.988 --> 00:24:59.270]  I guess killing the dogs, though, is to stop Al Qaeda.
[00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.992]  You know, everything's in this new heightened system.
[00:25:02.032 --> 00:25:08.278]  Now SWAT teams all over the country and police are being seen all over the news putting bags on people's heads.
[00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:10.726]  It's just all mimicking.
[00:25:10.746 --> 00:25:12.267]  They're all being federally trained.
[00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:14.549]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:21.954]  Then again, we're going to have a writer and photographer from the London Independent who was in Baghdad in an unembedded group.
[00:25:22.134 --> 00:25:23.055]  Incredible stories.
[00:25:23.115 --> 00:25:24.015]  Wait till you hear about it.
[00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:28.459]  In the next hour, more on dirty bomb victims may be shot.
[00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:30.360]  It's the same system here, not just in England.
[00:25:31.218 --> 00:25:31.278]  U.S.
[00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:34.339]  and Saudi sentencing attacks were imminent, New York Times.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.521]  More than two weeks before Monday bombings, American and Saudi officials had grown increasingly alarmed.
[00:25:40.182 --> 00:25:48.825]  By intercepting communications that proved what they called strong indications that Islamic militants were preparing a terrorist attack against America and Saudi Arabia.
[00:25:50.626 --> 00:25:54.367]  Now there's been a bombing in Chechnya that killed at least 30 people yesterday.
[00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:58.389]  And, you know, the number one suspect of any bombing in Russia
[00:25:59.248 --> 00:26:03.991]  Is Putin, the guy was caught with his FSB in the fourth building planting the bombs.
[00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:05.032]  That's all over the news.
[00:26:05.792 --> 00:26:14.217]  And they had the members of the media and the police that caught the FSB arrested and others have fled the country and done interviews for British and German and French television.
[00:26:14.837 --> 00:26:17.019]  I mean, it's just the same story over and over again.
[00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:18.880]  And now this has happened.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.040]  They say suicide bombers.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.922]  Let me tell you how this works if it is a globalist.
[00:26:22.322 --> 00:26:26.584]  It could be independent groups, though I doubt it, from all the evidence in the MO and the past activities.
[00:26:26.965 --> 00:26:27.565]  And the motive
[00:26:29.116 --> 00:26:35.578]  You have globalist groups that fund terror arms, that then find useful idiots that believe in the Jihad that will carry out attacks.
[00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:36.418]  It's just that simple.
[00:26:37.479 --> 00:26:42.340]  So perfect for the globalists to take over the entire Middle East, and this legitimizes the total takeover.
[00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:45.721]  And again, we have Israel founding Hamas in 1973.
[00:26:45.941 --> 00:26:55.064]  United Press International and others have reported, including Harat in Israel, founded them to create the crises so they never can make a peace deal.
[00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:57.225]  They can expand the living space, the
[00:26:58.234 --> 00:26:59.894]  The territorial control.
[00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:04.416]  Justice Department plans to step up gun crime prosecutions.
[00:27:05.116 --> 00:27:06.936]  This too out of the New York Times.
[00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:11.477]  Justice Department officials said today they plan to step up prosecutions of gun crimes.
[00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:18.099]  Part of a new initiative even as the private study said prosecutors had ignored a vast majority of gun crimes.
[00:27:18.894 --> 00:27:29.260]  Now, by that, you get pulled over, you're not supposed to have a handgun in your car in Texas, you legally cannot buy it at the store and get it home, you cannot go to a shooting range, it's all up to their discretion.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.242]  Well, under this, they'll have to file it, you'll probably serve ten years in prison.
[00:27:33.963 --> 00:27:34.463]  Federally.
[00:27:35.944 --> 00:27:46.350]  Federal charges across the board, we're going to get into what is known as the Clinton Safe Streets Initiative, uh, slash
[00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:52.393]  The other names that it has been given, like Exiled.
[00:27:53.413 --> 00:28:08.458]  Also, Firm was cover for the CIA Benefits, a company that had been accused of being a CIA front, of recruiting executive mercenaries, and attempting to overthrow the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth State.
[00:28:10.358 --> 00:28:15.380]  The Vennel Corporation kept a low profile in the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh.
[00:28:16.218 --> 00:28:20.881]  It's discreet security fooled nobody, however.
[00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.743]  The bomb attack was the second it has suffered in eight years.
[00:28:24.063 --> 00:28:30.728]  But don't worry, the news is reporting the CIA was out of the building because they've been, quote, getting warnings.
[00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:33.730]  Very, very interesting.
[00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.632]  Also, Terracell had recent gun battle.
[00:28:37.868 --> 00:28:44.335]  With the police, the Islamic militants behind the devastating car bombings in three residential compounds Monday.
[00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:45.436]  Oh, they already know who did it now.
[00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:48.880]  In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, part of an Al-Qaeda cellar.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.982]  Who founded Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda?
[00:28:51.022 --> 00:28:56.648]  And they got the Karl group and the Bin Laden family and their old business partners with much of the cabinet in the White House.
[00:28:56.688 --> 00:28:57.349]  This is a joke.
[00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:03.630]  Whose members fought a gun battle last week with Saudi authorities before escaping arrest, Saudi officials said today.
[00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:14.738]  At the time, police raided a suspected hideout, uncovering weapon cache that included 55 hand grenades, 829 pounds of explosives, and 2,545 bullets of different calibers.
[00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:19.462]  The May 6th raid took place at a safehouse several hundred yards from the building's hit.
[00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:22.315]  Now, this is how they could bring down Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:22.355 --> 00:29:24.015]  The globalists have said they may want to do this.
[00:29:24.616 --> 00:29:28.117]  And they've used Al-Qaeda to bring down Serbia to get Serbs to fight back.
[00:29:28.597 --> 00:29:29.797]  Then they attacked the Serbs.
[00:29:30.358 --> 00:29:33.139]  They used Al-Qaeda to take the fall for 9-1-1.
[00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:38.541]  Then they flew Al-Qaeda out to safety right before the major cities fell.
[00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:40.701]  That easy victory in Afghanistan.
[00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:41.882]  That was a staged war.
[00:29:42.282 --> 00:29:43.202]  We know that.
[00:29:43.902 --> 00:29:44.363]  The M.O.
[00:29:44.423 --> 00:29:45.243]  is clear here.
[00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.053]  We've got some guests coming up to talk about the police state.
[00:29:49.473 --> 00:29:50.814]  We'll also take your calls.
[00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:51.455]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:51.495 --> 00:29:52.556]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[00:29:52.656 --> 00:29:53.858]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.918 --> 00:29:55.740]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.702]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:12.705]  Did you remember to take your Focus Factor this morning?
[00:30:13.126 --> 00:30:13.406]  No?
[00:30:13.787 --> 00:30:14.367]  Too bad!
[00:30:14.828 --> 00:30:21.076]  Every morning, men, women, and children across the country start their day with Focus Factor, because they rely on it to feed their... 877-605-9200.
[00:30:21.316 --> 00:30:21.557]  Call today.
[00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:50.273]  Alright, coming up, more on the terror drills training you for the police state.
[00:30:51.393 --> 00:30:54.515]  More on the dollar plunging and your phone calls.
[00:30:56.169 --> 00:31:07.655]  We have a guest who's a photographer and writer, the London Independent, who was in the Middle East, in Baghdad, as an unembedded reporter, and can tell you the reality of what happened.
[00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:18.081]  Also, there's more evidence coming out, that's at TheMemoryHole.com, we've posted it on Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com, about fake photos.
[00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:25.545]  The media is creating fake photos, fake signs, where Iraqis are supposedly threatening us,
[00:31:26.483 --> 00:31:30.686]  Just incredible propaganda, so we're going to be covering that in the next hour.
[00:31:32.688 --> 00:31:35.490]  Joining us, it's a story out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.
[00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.153]  We covered it on Monday, now obviously it's Wednesday.
[00:31:40.994 --> 00:31:45.758]  Militarized police went to a man's home who had some parking tickets, literal parking tickets.
[00:31:46.374 --> 00:31:46.954]  No warrant.
[00:31:47.015 --> 00:31:47.635]  No nothing.
[00:31:47.795 --> 00:31:48.976]  Shot three of his dogs.
[00:31:49.016 --> 00:31:49.796]  Killed two of them.
[00:31:49.876 --> 00:31:50.597]  Injured another.
[00:31:51.177 --> 00:31:52.358]  The dog's in the vet.
[00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:54.820]  The vet won't give him treatment until he's given thousands of dollars.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.462]  He's got thousands of dollars in bond for his tickets.
[00:31:59.383 --> 00:32:02.125]  And the community is absolutely outraged.
[00:32:03.245 --> 00:32:03.926]  Lou London,
[00:32:04.932 --> 00:32:08.714]  There's a local radio host who has made sure this story has gotten attention.
[00:32:09.194 --> 00:32:13.416]  And of course, Councilwoman Gail Hoover was the first to come out and say this is wrong.
[00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:16.218]  And this is a giant trend around the country.
[00:32:16.258 --> 00:32:17.598]  You're lucky if it's just your dogs.
[00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:20.620]  Many times they shoot their own officers, members of the public.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.463]  In this case, they shot the place full of holes and into rooms with small children.
[00:32:27.588 --> 00:32:27.948]  Why?
[00:32:28.028 --> 00:32:28.969]  For parking tickets.
[00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:32.970]  It's this insane military attack mindset.
[00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.550]  We now have SWAT teams putting bags over people's heads.
[00:32:35.891 --> 00:32:40.172]  They're like playing out the battle for Baghdad against people that have parking tickets.
[00:32:40.232 --> 00:32:43.593]  It's some type of delusional, militarized, bloodthirsty hatred.
[00:32:44.233 --> 00:32:50.815]  And yesterday I was doing a show on Newstalk 1260 KWNX, filling in for the local host who was in the hospital.
[00:32:52.487 --> 00:33:11.363]  And I had people walk up, two people, not just one, but one on air, another person who was at the restaurant, at Fuddruckers, the big hamburger place, and came up and said, yeah, right here in Georgetown, somebody robbed the chicken place, and so they went into a neighborhood, and somebody's dog barked at them, so they shot it.
[00:33:12.184 --> 00:33:16.808]  And another person said, yeah, they killed my neighbor's dog serving a warrant for unpaid tickets.
[00:33:16.848 --> 00:33:19.010]  They come to your house, your dog barks, they kill it.
[00:33:19.648 --> 00:33:22.450]  But then you yell at a police dog, you get arrested now.
[00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.470]  We've read those articles.
[00:33:24.191 --> 00:33:25.051]  So it's insane.
[00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:31.775]  Gayle, again, Hoover, is the Allentown PA Councilwoman, and Lou London is a talk show host covering this.
[00:33:32.695 --> 00:33:36.037]  Ladies, thank you for coming on the show to talk about this bizarre event.
[00:33:36.613 --> 00:33:37.893]  Well, you're certainly welcome.
[00:33:38.334 --> 00:33:42.215]  Um, Lou is unfortunately tied up and isn't here, but I'm Gail and I'm here with you.
[00:33:42.235 --> 00:33:42.615]  No, I'm here.
[00:33:42.635 --> 00:33:43.115]  I'm here, Gail.
[00:33:43.395 --> 00:33:43.935]  Well, I hear her.
[00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:44.395]  I know she's there.
[00:33:44.515 --> 00:33:44.936]  Oh, you are?
[00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:45.056]  Okay.
[00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:50.817]  I know she's at a restaurant, and so she doesn't have long, so we'll go to her first, but both you guys jump in.
[00:33:51.157 --> 00:33:53.858]  Gail Hoover, when you found out about this, did it make you angry?
[00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:55.839]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:33:56.499 --> 00:33:57.279]  Absolutely.
[00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:02.761]  The thought of a gun being used and bullets being fired in a home full of
[00:34:03.627 --> 00:34:07.530]  Of adults and three toddlers, I believe, under the age of six.
[00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.872]  And family pets is just unacceptable to me.
[00:34:11.152 --> 00:34:16.476]  Now you said in the newspaper, and the newspaper confirmed, no warrants, no nothing, they just show up and start shooting.
[00:34:17.532 --> 00:34:18.873]  Well, he said he had a warrant.
[00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:22.316]  I don't know that the warrant was ever actually shown to the owners of the house.
[00:34:22.596 --> 00:34:24.758]  Well, the news says here they didn't have any paperwork.
[00:34:26.359 --> 00:34:32.865]  Now, they've arrested... Number one, and Lou, Gail, jump at any time, just tell us the story.
[00:34:33.245 --> 00:34:34.466]  What exactly happened?
[00:34:34.786 --> 00:34:36.148]  What is the response of the community?
[00:34:36.168 --> 00:34:37.269]  What are the police saying?
[00:34:37.289 --> 00:34:38.810]  And why is this man in jail?
[00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:58.544]  Alright, well last Friday, this is Lou London talking, I'm a newswoman from WAED in Allentown, and last Friday I came into work and saw the police report, which is in the paper, of course buried on page B9, which is not front page news, and read the report about constables in Allentown shoot three dogs while serving warrant.
[00:34:58.904 --> 00:35:00.225]  Kids are nearby, what have you.
[00:35:00.245 --> 00:35:02.767]  I read the story, I couldn't believe it didn't make news.
[00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:05.769]  Saw the address, went to the home Saturday morning.
[00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:15.698]  Talked to every one of the victims, saw the bullet holes, and this is the short version, and then I quickly got on the phone actually Friday night and Saturday to Gail Hoover.
[00:35:15.738 --> 00:35:16.599]  Gail and I spoke.
[00:35:17.059 --> 00:35:18.160]  Both of us went back there.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.062]  Gail's been working on the TV media.
[00:35:20.142 --> 00:35:21.383]  I've been working with the victims.
[00:35:21.763 --> 00:35:23.525]  Saturday afternoon went straight to the vet.
[00:35:24.005 --> 00:35:26.748]  In short, the officer shows up at the front door.
[00:35:27.737 --> 00:35:30.379]  He says, I have a warrant to a lady named Suzanne Klein.
[00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:31.920]  She has a mother of three children.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.081]  He says, are there any dogs in the house?
[00:35:34.101 --> 00:35:35.482]  She says, yes, we have three.
[00:35:35.522 --> 00:35:36.683]  He says, go contain them.
[00:35:37.043 --> 00:35:38.724]  She walks upstairs to contain them.
[00:35:38.744 --> 00:35:41.967]  Now, all this time, he's never shown a court document that has no warrant.
[00:35:42.007 --> 00:35:44.148]  Suzanne has said, I've never seen anything.
[00:35:44.568 --> 00:35:52.193]  She walks upstairs to tell Vicky, who owns the house, who is in the bedroom with the dogs, don't open the door.
[00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:53.034]  Vicky doesn't
[00:35:53.783 --> 00:35:59.326]  Hear her in time opens the door and then all the two women are running downstairs and the dogs go first.
[00:35:59.446 --> 00:36:01.828]  Dogs will always go to greet any commotion.
[00:36:02.268 --> 00:36:06.530]  Officer opens fire, shoots the boxer who's four years old first two times.
[00:36:06.971 --> 00:36:08.511]  They're screaming by this point.
[00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:14.615]  The boxer's laying there wounded and the officer, according to the two women who witnessed this horrible scene,
[00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:30.829]  I'm not sure how old the pit bull was, were running away, running away from the constable at that point.
[00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:40.358]  Then he started running after those dogs through the house with what looked like a turkey shoot according to Greg Glass who owns a boxer and he loaded
[00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:46.716]  He unloaded five bullets into the 14-year-old Shepherd who died and then he shot twice.
[00:36:46.756 --> 00:36:53.061]  Now, according to the paper and according to your reports and the press releases I've seen, there's just bullet holes as you go to the house.
[00:36:53.081 --> 00:36:58.745]  You can see the trail of blood where they were chased around in this bloodthirsty spasm.
[00:36:58.765 --> 00:36:59.086]  I've seen it.
[00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:00.146]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:37:01.247 --> 00:37:03.028]  So, we've been on this case ever since.
[00:37:03.048 --> 00:37:04.390]  Gail and I are determined.
[00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.632]  We have to change our laws across the United States, but we're going to start here in Allentown.
[00:37:07.652 --> 00:37:08.873]  We have to do something.
[00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:13.827]  Well, did you see the smokes case in Tennessee where the dog gets out, it's tail's wagging?
[00:37:13.847 --> 00:37:14.528]  Yes, yes I did.
[00:37:14.548 --> 00:37:18.249]  The family's all in the fire ants, you know, in the dirt, in their knees.
[00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.371]  The dog comes out, tail wagging, and the guy just blasted.
[00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:25.293]  And the people fall to the ground, they're so devastated, they're broken hearted.
[00:37:25.673 --> 00:37:30.176]  People need to understand, domestic pets are valued as family members.
[00:37:30.236 --> 00:37:30.956]  We have to change.
[00:37:31.016 --> 00:37:32.797]  I saw that story, we have to change our laws.
[00:37:32.877 --> 00:37:36.679]  I saw the story, Mr. Jones, and I was devastated.
[00:37:36.699 --> 00:37:38.580]  Well, let me tell you, I've been to homes.
[00:37:39.474 --> 00:37:54.538]  Where they serve warrants for tickets, and you go to the house, and there's blood all over the kitchen walls, and they go, here's the photos, and there's a lab with its brains literally in globs on the floor, intestines everywhere, ten bullet holes in it.
[00:37:54.858 --> 00:37:58.019]  They come in, the lab was killed on its bed in the kitchen.
[00:37:58.599 --> 00:38:10.167]  They come in the back door, the lab got up, of course it growled and barked, for a few seconds standing on its bed, and they just pulverized it into bloody pulp.
[00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:19.233]  And I've been to these houses, I've seen this, in Dallas they have been known to kill dogs as small as chihuahuas.
[00:38:19.413 --> 00:38:20.474]  Oh, that's horrible!
[00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:26.294]  Why are they, now they say that the dog, they can't control the situation.
[00:38:26.535 --> 00:38:29.923]  Did you hear about Waco, where the dogs were caged and they shot them?
[00:38:31.298 --> 00:38:33.678]  Well, Gail, I'll let you take this one, but let me say it first.
[00:38:33.718 --> 00:38:34.999]  Gail knows this as well.
[00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:37.659]  Constables are paid per case.
[00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:50.882]  These guys were going to get this situation handled because Jeremiah Hartman, who had the outstanding parking tickets, was upstairs getting dressed, ready, willing, and able to greet the constables.
[00:38:50.922 --> 00:38:52.842]  But, Gail, you know about constables.
[00:38:52.942 --> 00:38:54.402]  They are elected officials.
[00:38:54.742 --> 00:38:58.483]  In fact, Gail will tell you, these two constables are up for re-election, Gail.
[00:38:58.963 --> 00:39:04.707]  Why didn't they just knock on the door and say, come on down, you're going to jail?
[00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:05.968]  Why do this?
[00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.911]  Gail, I'll let you take this.
[00:39:09.111 --> 00:39:12.313]  Again, this really wasn't the police force that did this.
[00:39:12.393 --> 00:39:13.794]  This is constables.
[00:39:13.894 --> 00:39:23.001]  And in Pennsylvania, constables are independently elected and then they run their own little business as independent contractors.
[00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:28.085]  And they get paid per warrant that they serve, per arrest that they make.
[00:39:29.188 --> 00:39:38.151]  Um... What did they say after they blasted, after this guy chased the dogs around the house and blew them away?
[00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.632]  Well let me just, let me comment before, Gayle, before you get in on this one.
[00:39:41.952 --> 00:39:46.354]  From what we understand from the victims, there was no apology because I went over this and over this and over this.
[00:39:46.734 --> 00:39:47.374]  No apology.
[00:39:47.854 --> 00:39:49.896]  They called the police right away, the constables.
[00:39:49.936 --> 00:39:55.281]  The Allentown police showed up, and the police of course treated these victims as criminals.
[00:39:55.442 --> 00:39:59.786]  And the woman who answered the door, her name is Vicki, with the three children, was covered in blood.
[00:40:00.186 --> 00:40:03.109]  The police said to her, they said to her, go sit down.
[00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:07.253]  And Vicki said to the cop, I don't want my children to see this blood.
[00:40:07.353 --> 00:40:09.996]  He said, honey, it's Allentown, they're going to see it anyway.
[00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:13.175]  That's outrageous.
[00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:16.298]  This is not what Allentown is about.
[00:40:16.358 --> 00:40:18.400]  This is not what the police force is about.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.704]  This does not happen every day here.
[00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:25.087]  This is an isolated case.
[00:40:25.107 --> 00:40:29.891]  I'm just so outraged that a gun could go off like this.
[00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:31.913]  Constables have no accountability.
[00:40:31.973 --> 00:40:33.455]  The system in Pennsylvania
[00:40:33.815 --> 00:40:36.576]  Yeah, it's just roving vans out collecting booty on the highway.
[00:40:55.184 --> 00:41:03.982]  However, Allentown police have said there was not enough evidence to charge the constables with criminal behavior.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:11.322]  Now, has the constable said why he chased the running dogs to the house?
[00:41:11.362 --> 00:41:13.422]  Was it just the bloodlust was so delicious?
[00:41:13.842 --> 00:41:15.343]  Well, I'll take this one, too.
[00:41:16.163 --> 00:41:20.124]  The constable who lives in Bethlehem Township, all three of these cities are together.
[00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.725]  It's formed as the Lehigh Valley.
[00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:23.265]  It's Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton.
[00:41:23.585 --> 00:41:25.146]  He's a Bethlehem Township constable.
[00:41:25.166 --> 00:41:25.906]  That's where he lives.
[00:41:25.946 --> 00:41:30.747]  And a story came out the following day that he has a history of gun incidents.
[00:41:30.807 --> 00:41:32.268]  His name is Richard Seeds.
[00:41:32.828 --> 00:41:36.130]  He had at one time shot an unarmed man in his home.
[00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:42.135]  Okay, we don't know if that's really justified, but I don't think he once shot two teenagers on a bike.
[00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:43.175]  Fourteen year olds.
[00:41:44.056 --> 00:41:45.097]  That's not justified.
[00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:51.481]  It seems that the man's only solution to anything that he incurs is to pull his gun.
[00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:58.136]  As a constable who's used to going in and out of homes, obviously he doesn't carry pepper spray.
[00:41:58.156 --> 00:41:59.939]  There are no other options for this guy.
[00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:01.842]  Whatever happens, I'll just use my gun.
[00:42:02.122 --> 00:42:03.805]  If it's teenagers, I'll use my gun.
[00:42:04.106 --> 00:42:06.430]  If there's toddlers in the house, I'll use my gun.
[00:42:07.481 --> 00:42:11.023]  Well, this is definitely a mad bull out of control.
[00:42:11.483 --> 00:42:14.525]  Well, Mr. Jones, can I update you on the dog, though, that survived?
[00:42:14.805 --> 00:42:15.426]  Oh, that's right.
[00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:16.946]  The vet isn't going to give it treatment.
[00:42:17.447 --> 00:42:18.567]  Let me update you on that.
[00:42:19.328 --> 00:42:20.849]  By the way, I work for two vets.
[00:42:21.389 --> 00:42:24.131]  It doesn't take a $2,000 down payment to fix a dog.
[00:42:24.151 --> 00:42:24.871]  That's ridiculous.
[00:42:25.111 --> 00:42:29.733]  Well, unfortunately, this is a veterinary referral.
[00:42:29.773 --> 00:42:31.754]  He's the only specialist in the Lehigh Valley.
[00:42:32.034 --> 00:42:37.716]  Let me back up and say the only reason I got a hold of Gayle is because she's bald enough to get something done in our state.
[00:42:38.176 --> 00:42:39.096]  And I know that she will.
[00:42:39.416 --> 00:42:40.117]  Go forward.
[00:42:40.337 --> 00:42:41.217]  I visited the vet.
[00:42:41.417 --> 00:42:45.039]  I've had three of my own injured and dying dogs at this vet.
[00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.159]  This is how they behave.
[00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:48.440]  They are the emergency and the only in town.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.361]  And then during the day, they are the specialist and the only in town.
[00:42:51.901 --> 00:42:55.144]  Yes, they had the dog in their care as of Thursday.
[00:42:55.184 --> 00:42:58.386]  By the time I got to them, by Saturday, they had not operated.
[00:42:58.426 --> 00:42:59.427]  They did need the money.
[00:43:00.027 --> 00:43:04.291]  Gail and I finally got on the phone on Monday, put up our own money.
[00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:05.912]  I put up my salary.
[00:43:06.252 --> 00:43:14.759]  Gail has gone to town collecting donations, but we actually got them to go ahead and do the surgery yesterday.
[00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:19.833]  Dr. Carlos Hodges removed the two bullets, one from the shoulder, one from the hip.
[00:43:19.873 --> 00:43:20.853]  She's now got pins.
[00:43:20.894 --> 00:43:29.639]  We're talking about the pit bull has pins and she will be released in my care to do rehab probably Thursday for the owner who's absolutely devastated.
[00:43:29.939 --> 00:43:31.280]  Now what about the husband?
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.882]  As of Monday he was still in jail with some gigantic bond for parking tickets.
[00:43:35.223 --> 00:43:37.084]  How did they behave when they arrested him?
[00:43:37.444 --> 00:43:38.144]  What happened there?
[00:43:38.184 --> 00:43:38.805]  What's going on?
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.363]  Well, from what I understand, he, uh, Jeremiah Hartman is his name.
[00:43:43.403 --> 00:43:57.212]  He was an ex-boyfriend's friend of the family, not a husband, but he is in jail on a $3,000 bail, and they arrested him at the vet's office, from what I understand.
[00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:59.254]  Now, that's what the vet said.
[00:43:59.274 --> 00:44:00.855]  I don't think the vet understands what happened.
[00:44:00.915 --> 00:44:05.358]  From what I understand from the victims in the home, they took him away right then and there.
[00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:08.389]  Well, this is just insane.
[00:44:08.449 --> 00:44:10.430]  Is he still in jail for the parking tickets?
[00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.451]  Yes, he can't make bail.
[00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:29.626]  So, the cops all descend, or the constables, as you say, the Sheriff of Nottingham, they descend, they kill two dogs, they shoot the other one a couple times, they don't apologize, they leave, and now the... I guess the community's pretty angry right now.
[00:44:30.146 --> 00:44:33.509]  Well, yeah, and Gail, you need to tell them what this is all about and tell them exactly.
[00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:42.687]  Quite honestly, this stems from a car that, from what I understand, was broken down.
[00:44:43.167 --> 00:44:46.169]  And when street cleaning came through, he couldn't move it.
[00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:52.153]  Parking tickets accumulated, and this is how it all culminated.
[00:44:52.954 --> 00:44:53.894]  It's parking tickets.
[00:44:54.315 --> 00:45:01.660]  Well, that's what the newspaper said, that he couldn't move it for a street sweeper, so now they get a vicious attack.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.103]  I mean, is this the new America?
[00:45:05.143 --> 00:45:10.289]  Well, you know, under Patriot Act, you're a terrorist for committing any type of crime, including misdemeanors.
[00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:13.913]  So I guess we're all going to be going to FEMA camps next or something.
[00:45:14.952 --> 00:45:17.814]  It's absolutely horrible and we need the American citizens.
[00:45:17.834 --> 00:45:20.215]  You know it could be your dog, Alex, Mr. Jones.
[00:45:20.256 --> 00:45:21.116]  It could be my dog.
[00:45:21.156 --> 00:45:22.517]  It could be Gail, your dog.
[00:45:22.957 --> 00:45:28.361]  We need, Americans need to recognize that we have to create some laws that are domestic pets.
[00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:31.283]  It's illegal to shoot our domestic pets.
[00:45:31.323 --> 00:45:34.004]  We're not talking about a bobcat that's gotten loose.
[00:45:34.024 --> 00:45:34.965]  We're not talking about a cougar.
[00:45:34.985 --> 00:45:36.506]  We're talking about our domestic animals.
[00:45:36.746 --> 00:45:39.268]  Part of our family, some people only have
[00:45:39.588 --> 00:45:40.610]  They're domestic pets.
[00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:42.152]  We all need to band together.
[00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:45.496]  As citizens, we need to stand up and take care of our domestic pets.
[00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:47.338]  Well, police understand this.
[00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:54.107]  Did you hear about Newcastle PA, where the guy yelled at the police dog that barked at him out of the cruiser?
[00:45:54.527 --> 00:45:55.529]  Yeah, he was sent to jail!
[00:45:57.245 --> 00:46:14.093]  And so this guy got, oh so you did hear about that, so he got jail time, a new guy barked at a, back at a police dog in California, he's been arrested, uh, I mean they care about their dogs, you can't even talk back to their dogs, but then they, absolutely, but then they gun our dogs down, where is the disconnect there?
[00:46:14.834 --> 00:46:25.579]  Well I look at it this way too, um, if, if I in my own home, shoot off several bullets in my own house, I'd be under arrest.
[00:46:26.266 --> 00:46:29.248]  If I shot my own dogs, I'd be under arrest.
[00:46:30.268 --> 00:46:37.792]  Somebody else comes into someone's house and does this under the label of constable, and it's acceptable.
[00:46:39.302 --> 00:46:44.923]  I will have to tell you that Thursday I actually heard this over the scanner going on, but didn't make out that it was dogs.
[00:46:45.444 --> 00:46:53.485]  And on the scanner on Thursday, and now putting it together, one of the dogs tried to jump out a second story window to get away, and there was an officer outside.
[00:46:53.585 --> 00:46:58.466]  We're not really clear yet as to how, if they ambushed this dog to shoot it several times or not.
[00:46:58.786 --> 00:46:59.607]  Oh, interesting!
[00:46:59.647 --> 00:47:03.007]  I must let you know that the forensics police have asked for the bullets.
[00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:06.188]  The vet, as of last night, stated he's not giving them back.
[00:47:06.568 --> 00:47:08.128]  Well, they got hit and hit hard by the Gestapo and
[00:47:27.576 --> 00:47:30.938]  All over parking tickets, couldn't move his broken down car.
[00:47:30.978 --> 00:47:32.759]  Well, the government's going to help you out, don't worry.
[00:47:32.779 --> 00:47:34.219]  We're going to drop by and kill your dogs.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.662]  And the police haven't, the constables haven't apologized.
[00:47:39.342 --> 00:47:44.504]  Not as yet, and I believe, Gail, you and I are working on... This is not over.
[00:47:44.544 --> 00:47:46.886]  These two constables are up for re-election.
[00:47:46.926 --> 00:47:53.089]  If I have to go door-to-door on an opposing campaign, and I will, Gail is more than willing to help out.
[00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:55.610]  Gail, what are you going to do in the campaign against these guys?
[00:47:56.815 --> 00:47:59.598]  Well, I've asked our local news.
[00:47:59.698 --> 00:48:06.326]  I'd lose helping out, absolutely, but all the other news outlets, so please, let's do a story about what this man's history is.
[00:48:06.426 --> 00:48:10.290]  One of the things is constables is not really a covered election most times.
[00:48:10.651 --> 00:48:11.732]  They cover the big ones.
[00:48:12.132 --> 00:48:12.473]  Mayor,
[00:48:13.714 --> 00:48:19.420]  Council commissioners and somehow constables kind of fall through the cracks.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.241]  All right.
[00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:26.247]  Talking to Councilwoman Gail Hoover and News Talk reporter Lou London.
[00:48:26.307 --> 00:48:28.209]  Thanks for joining me ladies and good job.
[00:48:28.529 --> 00:48:28.990]  Take care.
[00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:29.971]  I'll be right back.
[00:48:32.262 --> 00:48:39.651]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:39.912 --> 00:48:44.657]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:44.878 --> 00:48:50.545]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.765 --> 00:48:51.485]  We're good to go.
[00:49:07.374 --> 00:49:09.916]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:49:10.116 --> 00:49:16.880]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.

[00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:36.983]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:37.324 --> 00:49:41.426]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.706 --> 00:49:42.246]  We listened.
[00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:47.549]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:48.309]  We listened.
[00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.731]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:52.692]  We listened.
[00:49:53.152 --> 00:49:56.834]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power hours.
[00:49:56.834 --> 00:49:57.614]  I don't know.
[00:50:23.047 --> 00:50:26.390]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.953]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:51:36.192 --> 00:51:38.094]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:38.574 --> 00:51:41.556]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:42.777 --> 00:51:52.484]  Understand, if I wanted to demonize police, I could post at least a hundred articles every day on Infowars.com doing it.
[00:51:52.564 --> 00:51:54.866]  If I wanted to do that, I could.
[00:51:55.126 --> 00:51:55.847]  We really don't.
[00:51:55.907 --> 00:52:02.472]  We use these as examples of what's bad in peacekeeping now with our militarized police.
[00:52:02.912 --> 00:52:05.514]  No longer are peace officers, they're law enforcement and
[00:52:06.354 --> 00:52:13.178]  You know, I've seen our local SWAT teams wearing these shirts that talk about somebody going to die, natural born killers.
[00:52:13.458 --> 00:52:14.879]  I'm offended by that.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:23.605]  I mean, you guys want to go fight somebody, go sign up with the mercs and go fight on the Gold Coast of Africa for the UN taking over the diamonds.
[00:52:24.005 --> 00:52:25.386]  Fight people that shoot back.
[00:52:26.807 --> 00:52:29.329]  Not our old ladies, not our old men, not our dogs.
[00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:35.935]  I mean, I see articles every week where SWAT teams blow some kid in half, didn't have a gun, shoot somebody, and nothing happens.
[00:52:35.975 --> 00:52:37.437]  It happens all the time here in Austin.
[00:52:37.717 --> 00:52:40.239]  They've shot their own SWAT team members multiple times.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.841]  I see it all the time.
[00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:43.702]  I'm sick of it!
[00:52:43.842 --> 00:52:44.883]  It's crazy!
[00:52:45.904 --> 00:52:46.785]  It's insane!
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.324]  Whatever happened to when you want to get somebody parking down the street from their house, pulling them over, swarming them.
[00:52:53.404 --> 00:52:54.765]  It saves officers lives.
[00:52:55.085 --> 00:52:56.787]  You know SWAT teams are getting cops killed.
[00:52:57.547 --> 00:52:58.608]  John in Tennessee.
[00:52:58.708 --> 00:52:59.569]  John, you're on the air.
[00:52:59.629 --> 00:53:00.089]  Go ahead.
[00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:11.097]  Yes, arrests can never be made for unpaid parking tickets since there's no service of process which has to be handed to a person or mailed certified to a home.
[00:53:11.757 --> 00:53:13.719]  This is true for all civil lawsuits.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.241]  Which is basically what all parking tickets are.
[00:53:16.261 --> 00:53:19.382]  Yeah, but now they're making civil criminal because they have guns.
[00:53:19.402 --> 00:53:19.983]  That's what I mean.
[00:53:20.523 --> 00:53:24.085]  Well, you know, when people don't study their legal rights, they fall for this scam.
[00:53:24.825 --> 00:53:34.289]  In Knoxville, a lawyer actually made several citizen's arrests of police officers who tried to arrest him for refusing service of process of parking tickets.
[00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:39.712]  In Cookville, Tennessee, two lawyers were sued for 200 unpaid parking tickets.
[00:53:40.612 --> 00:53:46.353]  But when the smoke settled, the city was forced to remove all parking meters from downtown.
[00:53:46.413 --> 00:53:49.174]  Well, take the smoke case right there in Tennessee.
[00:53:49.614 --> 00:53:51.294]  The dog's tail was wagging.
[00:53:52.094 --> 00:53:53.394]  The dog was nice.
[00:53:53.754 --> 00:53:54.995]  They blew its head off.
[00:53:55.315 --> 00:53:58.875]  And that was the third dog killed by that particular police officer.
[00:53:59.415 --> 00:54:02.496]  Well, what is this enjoyment of killing?
[00:54:04.036 --> 00:54:05.696]  It's a feeding frenzy.
[00:54:06.157 --> 00:54:08.177]  I think a lot of the cops are mentally unstable.
[00:54:08.197 --> 00:54:08.657]  They're picked.
[00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:11.533]  For that character trait.
[00:54:13.454 --> 00:54:21.061]  Well, there are major metropolitan police forces that will not allow you to become an officer if you score over 100 on the IQ test.
[00:54:21.101 --> 00:54:21.922]  So what does that say?
[00:54:23.183 --> 00:54:36.054]  Well, as far as constables go, Tennessee fired all their constables after complaints of plainclothes constables driving their personal vehicles around and following people home and handing them traffic tickets.
[00:54:36.966 --> 00:54:37.487]  It's incredible.
[00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:39.608]  Tennessee banned all their constables after that.
[00:54:39.869 --> 00:54:40.930]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:50.618]  I know that I had a constable give me a $500 parking ticket because I parked on the line of a handicapped spot.
[00:54:50.899 --> 00:54:52.160]  It was at Eckerds.
[00:54:53.441 --> 00:54:56.123]  I pull in about four years ago.
[00:54:56.343 --> 00:55:00.087]  I park on the line because somebody was parked crooked.
[00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:08.036]  And I walk out to a $500 parking ticket, and the parking ticket said a photo has been taken of your car.
[00:55:08.736 --> 00:55:16.802]  And before I end this segment, Police State 3 Total Enslavement is out, my newest film, 2 hours, 37 minutes long, $25.95.
[00:55:16.902 --> 00:55:18.383]  It's really three films in one.
[00:55:21.394 --> 00:55:22.455]  Some of our best work.
[00:55:22.615 --> 00:55:26.437]  Also, we have the Road to Tyranny, the Masters of Terror, the other Police State videos.
[00:55:26.557 --> 00:55:29.619]  The videos drop down to $20 from $25.95.
[00:55:29.999 --> 00:55:36.122]  If you order three or more, my book is $12, 230 pages, 9-1-1, Dissentant to Tyranny.
[00:55:36.202 --> 00:55:37.103]  Find out the truth.
[00:55:37.443 --> 00:55:37.963]  Get the book.
[00:55:38.003 --> 00:55:38.664]  Get the films.
[00:55:38.824 --> 00:55:42.426]  Make copies for non-profit educational not-for-sale purposes.
[00:55:42.926 --> 00:55:46.228]  Get it out to everybody in your area and wake people up to what's happening.
[00:55:46.707 --> 00:55:48.968]  The toll-free number to order the films is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:49.068 --> 00:55:55.072]  That's 888-253-3139, or in full wars.com or net order, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L.A.
[00:55:55.092 --> 00:55:56.633]  Mayor, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:16.016 --> 00:56:19.920]  Warrior calls, a ton of geopolitical news, and the economy coming up.
[00:56:22.402 --> 00:56:25.024]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:56:25.264 --> 00:56:30.990]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.352]  You haven't alkalized your body in fat body.
[00:56:37.095 --> 00:56:40.258]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:48.394 --> 00:56:49.034]  Big Brother.
[00:56:49.694 --> 00:56:50.755]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:51.455 --> 00:56:52.575]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:53.215 --> 00:56:54.036]  You want answers?
[00:56:54.796 --> 00:56:55.736]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:56.356 --> 00:56:59.957]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.537 --> 00:57:04.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.759 --> 00:57:09.020]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:14.181]  Already into the second hour of this Wednesday, the 14th of May, 2003, edition of the show.
[00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:19.871]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:23.112]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:24.753 --> 00:57:35.917]  We're going to get into the plunging dollar, the exploding trade deficit, the convenient, tragic bombings, but they are convenient for the globalists, that took place.
[00:57:35.937 --> 00:57:40.559]  They claim that the CIA founded organization Al-Qaeda is responsible.
[00:57:42.102 --> 00:57:49.884]  We'll get into what martial law will be like in England and the United States, and some of the new gun control developments.
[00:57:49.924 --> 00:57:51.325]  Some of it's good, some of it's bad.
[00:57:51.745 --> 00:57:53.205]  We'll be discussing it.
[00:57:54.726 --> 00:57:57.987]  And we're going to take a lot of calls this hour as well.
[00:57:58.968 --> 00:58:23.477]  Then, in about 30 minutes, I am going to be joined by a reporter for the London Independent, who's also a photographer, who was in the Middle East during the Gulf War, Gulf War II, and has some of the photos and stuff from Baghdad, and what really is going on there from an unembedded, that is, un-propagandized, controlled, non-CIA, non-military intelligence reporter.
[00:58:24.235 --> 00:58:27.117]  So that's coming up in about 30 minutes, the toll-free number.
[00:58:27.617 --> 00:58:36.343]  To join me on air on any of the issues I covered in the last hour, any of the issues I'm about to fire out, we'll go to your calls directly in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:36.523 --> 00:58:48.792]  Again, dirty bomb victims may be shot, any type of red alert over in England, you try to get in their way, the cops are going to shoot you, that's the Scotsman,
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:59:03.386]  Turns out the CIA, quote, had warnings of the attack, and they weren't home when the attack took place, but other Americans and Australians and Brits.
[00:59:04.827 --> 00:59:21.279]  Twelve-some folks from Portugal were there, unfortunately, when three bombs ripped through apartment sections in some of the western living areas there in the quarantined area of Riyadh, the capital of the, well, one of the most corrupt states in the world, Saudi Arabia.
[00:59:22.973 --> 00:59:42.709]  Saudi Arabia is being controlled by Al-Qaeda, which just like the CIA used Al-Qaeda according to the Senate report in 1999 to attack the Serbs, destabilized, just like Al-Qaeda was used to destabilize Afghanistan at the stage of that war, now they're being used to destabilize Saudi Arabia so the globalists can move in there during a revolution and quote, restore order.
[00:59:43.453 --> 00:59:50.859]  They've already got their new base of operations, Iraq, to do that, and then launch counter-pronged attacks into Syria and Iran.
[00:59:50.879 --> 01:00:05.670]  That's where you're going to see more terror here and abroad to legitimize, as the Project for the American Century said, as Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld and others wrote, they need, quote, Pearl Harbor catastrophic events to legitimize the war for a new world order and global empire.
[01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:06.551]  They said it, I didn't.
[01:00:08.052 --> 01:00:11.475]  Justice Department plans to step up gun crime prosecutions.
[01:00:12.502 --> 01:00:20.862]  And it turns out the Justice Department is going to basically any type of gun crime, including non-violent stuff, possession, you name it, federal charges.
[01:00:22.134 --> 01:00:30.039]  And it is now coming out that Tom DeLay is saying that they're not going to go along with Bush.
[01:00:30.519 --> 01:00:33.061]  They are not going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:35.262]  And remember, I read the NRA alert yesterday.
[01:00:35.683 --> 01:00:37.824]  Ban all semi-automatic shotguns.
[01:00:38.324 --> 01:00:39.665]  Ban almost everything.
[01:00:40.365 --> 01:00:44.148]  The most incredible gun control ever seen in this reauthorization.
[01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.769]  That's how the Democrats are going to bring it to the floor.
[01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:51.896]  And Bush says he agrees with it, so pretty serious information there for you.
[01:00:52.597 --> 01:00:54.600]  We'll be covering that in detail.
[01:00:55.723 --> 01:00:56.483]  Some of the big news.
[01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:57.784]  Swamping dollars.
[01:00:57.864 --> 01:00:59.224]  There's policy debate.
[01:00:59.564 --> 01:01:01.064]  How low can it go?
[01:01:01.485 --> 01:01:04.425]  Just a year and a half ago, the euro was at 90 cents of the dollar.
[01:01:04.926 --> 01:01:07.766]  They're now talking about it hitting 130 by the end of next week.
[01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:09.227]  It's now been trading, I guess, at 120.
[01:01:09.947 --> 01:01:13.488]  I thought it was the highest was 117 against the dollar, but they're now saying 120.
[01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:15.108]  Swamping dollars.
[01:01:15.168 --> 01:01:16.289]  There's policy debate.
[01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:17.649]  I'll tell you about that when we get back.
[01:01:18.089 --> 01:01:18.609]  Forbes.
[01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.911]  Central Bank's claim on euro now at 130.
[01:01:26.065 --> 01:01:27.106]  Yes, we'll cover that.
[01:01:27.126 --> 01:01:28.828]  $130 to the dollar.
[01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:33.374]  Trade gap widens to $43.5 billion last month.
[01:01:34.695 --> 01:01:37.078]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:37.158 --> 01:01:38.199]  Your calls as well.
[01:01:38.299 --> 01:01:39.100]  And a great guest.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:39.321]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:39.361 --> 01:01:39.641]  Stay with me.
[01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:49.305]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:01:49.645 --> 01:01:53.748]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:01:54.048 --> 01:01:54.589]  We listened.
[01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:59.873]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:02:00.153 --> 01:02:00.633]  We listened.
[01:02:01.014 --> 01:02:04.056]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:02:04.496 --> 01:02:05.017]  We listened.
[01:02:05.497 --> 01:02:09.320]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.061]  We're good.
[01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:39.032]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:02:39.852 --> 01:02:42.513]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:02:43.954 --> 01:02:51.337]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:51.597 --> 01:02:56.339]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:56.559 --> 01:03:02.201]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:02.441 --> 01:03:03.162]  We're good to go.
[01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:18.602]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:44.574 --> 01:03:48.197]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:52.740]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:57.384]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:03:57.564 --> 01:04:00.546]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:04:00.846 --> 01:04:05.470]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:09.573]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:04:09.873 --> 01:04:12.255]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:16.459]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:21.864]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:04:22.085 --> 01:04:25.007]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:04:25.168 --> 01:04:27.069]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:31.854]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:04:32.074 --> 01:04:35.255]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[01:04:35.675 --> 01:04:38.695]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:49.758]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:53.499 --> 01:05:00.440]  We are scheduled to have Britain's most award-winning, highly decorated foreign correspondent
[01:05:01.124 --> 01:05:03.445]  Robert Fisk, joining us.
[01:05:03.605 --> 01:05:09.068]  He has received the British International Journalist of the Year Award seven times, most recently 95 and 96.
[01:05:09.108 --> 01:05:13.730]  His speciality is the Middle East, where he has spent the last 23 years.
[01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:17.531]  Currently the Beirut correspondent for London Independent.
[01:05:17.611 --> 01:05:24.534]  Fisk has covered the Iranian Revolution, the Iran-Iraq War, the Persian Gulf War, and the conflict in Algeria.
[01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:28.016]  He is the author of Pity the Nation, Lebanon at War,
[01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:33.958]  And his reporting from Lebanon brought him international attention, and he's joining us.
[01:05:33.998 --> 01:05:39.125]  He was in Iraq, in Baghdad, and we've linked his website and the photos, and it's grisly.
[01:05:39.565 --> 01:05:42.670]  The mowing down of protesters, the unbelievable corruption.
[01:05:43.662 --> 01:05:46.064]  It's all coming up later in this hour.
[01:05:46.124 --> 01:05:51.028]  I'm about to get to what happened to the dollar, where it's going, and what this means to you financially right now.
[01:05:51.168 --> 01:05:53.830]  Elias in Michigan, you're on the air, sir.
[01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:54.250]  Welcome.
[01:05:54.531 --> 01:05:54.911]  Hi.
[01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:55.671]  Hi, Alex.
[01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:56.192]  How are you doing?
[01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:57.133]  Pretty good, my friend.
[01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:57.713]  Good, good.
[01:05:58.574 --> 01:06:02.417]  I just heard you talk about the project for the New American Century.
[01:06:03.177 --> 01:06:04.078]  You know that document?
[01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:06.541]  Well, it's about a hundred documents.
[01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:08.542]  It's a fake tank.
[01:06:08.562 --> 01:06:11.002]  They wrote, for those who don't know, policy reports.
[01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:14.903]  The White House had already formed its cabinet, and they said, Saddam isn't a threat.
[01:06:15.303 --> 01:06:18.783]  Word for word, we want the oil, a military base, a new world order.
[01:06:19.263 --> 01:06:22.124]  They said we need Pearl Harbor events to get the war going.
[01:06:22.164 --> 01:06:22.544]  Go ahead.
[01:06:23.644 --> 01:06:26.265]  That's an enormous document, but you can download it.
[01:06:26.785 --> 01:06:27.845]  You can get the whole thing.
[01:06:29.545 --> 01:06:31.906]  I'm not sure what website I got it from.
[01:06:31.986 --> 01:06:33.466]  ProjectforNewAmericanCentury.org.
[01:06:34.738 --> 01:06:35.038]  Pardon?
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.041]  They have a website.
[01:06:38.341 --> 01:06:39.682]  It's, uh... Yeah.
[01:06:39.982 --> 01:06:42.044]  ProjectForNewAmericanCentury.org.
[01:06:42.364 --> 01:06:43.124]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:43.164 --> 01:06:44.445]  You can get the whole document.
[01:06:45.046 --> 01:06:46.587]  Well, there's not one document.
[01:06:46.607 --> 01:06:47.808]  There's hundreds of essays.
[01:06:47.828 --> 01:06:49.069]  Yeah, it's an enormous thing.
[01:06:49.189 --> 01:06:54.473]  Written by the Secretary of Defense, written by Jeb Bush, written by Dick Cheney.
[01:06:54.493 --> 01:06:55.054]  Right, right.
[01:06:55.274 --> 01:06:56.595]  It's a policy board.
[01:06:56.635 --> 01:06:59.237]  They can get that whole document and read it all.
[01:06:59.457 --> 01:07:01.759]  But, sir, there's hundreds of documents.
[01:07:02.509 --> 01:07:06.510]  Well, this was a big, gigantic thing, and it came to... I'm not sure where I got it from.
[01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:13.751]  But it, uh... I did get it, and it occupied an enormous space on the hard drive.
[01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:14.871]  But you can get it.
[01:07:15.652 --> 01:07:16.812]  I'm not certain where I got it.
[01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:17.992]  I'll have to look and see where I got it from.
[01:07:18.012 --> 01:07:22.373]  Well, I mean, sir, it's been in at least 500 newspapers.
[01:07:22.553 --> 01:07:25.213]  It's been all over Nightline and everywhere else.
[01:07:25.233 --> 01:07:27.274]  We reported on it over a year ago.
[01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:27.994]  That's hundreds of pages.
[01:07:28.672 --> 01:07:28.992]  Pardon me?
[01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.914]  This was hundreds of pages.
[01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:32.655]  Well, that's just one report, sir.
[01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.076]  It's an organization.
[01:07:34.636 --> 01:07:35.637]  It's a think tank.
[01:07:38.519 --> 01:07:48.005]  It's public, but I would, if I was you, I would get it from the source, so you know where you got it, so when you tell people about it, you'll... Well, I say, they could download that and read it themselves.
[01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:54.350]  Read the whole, all the conniving, everything else that they did, it's all coming true.
[01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:56.451]  And this was written some years ago.
[01:07:56.471 --> 01:07:57.852]  Well, yeah, it's a confession.
[01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:12.488]  Beforehand, it's premeditated confession and it's right out in the open for everyone and it's a public organization made up of the most powerful people at the minion level in this government.
[01:08:12.569 --> 01:08:16.453]  Not the actual globalists but their enforcers, those that carry out their agenda.
[01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:21.109]  Well, it's nothing like purity to bring out the little tyrants all over.
[01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:22.070]  You're talking to that lady.
[01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:24.632]  Right, they have the same problem.
[01:08:25.013 --> 01:08:28.596]  You know, all the little ones around are all jumping to it.
[01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.658]  You know, let's do the same thing, you know?
[01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.040]  Go around treating people the same way.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:33.941]  Well, that's it.
[01:08:34.001 --> 01:08:37.725]  I mean, now we see police putting bags over people's heads when they arrest them.
[01:08:38.325 --> 01:08:40.547]  They're just emulating what they saw in Afghanistan.
[01:08:40.647 --> 01:08:41.288]  Absolutely.
[01:08:42.338 --> 01:08:46.461]  Well, you know, like I said, I think I talked to you, and I said, well, you know, where's the Constitution?
[01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:47.302]  You get mad at me.
[01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:49.003]  Well, don't get mad at me.
[01:08:49.223 --> 01:08:50.284]  You know, where is it?
[01:08:50.324 --> 01:08:55.868]  Hey, you know, people just rise up and do these things, and nobody can do anything about them.
[01:08:56.008 --> 01:08:58.130]  Elias, the Constitution didn't go wrong.
[01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:00.752]  It's not the problem of the Constitution failing.
[01:09:01.112 --> 01:09:02.573]  We failed America.
[01:09:03.357 --> 01:09:03.677]  Right!
[01:09:04.117 --> 01:09:04.377]  Right!
[01:09:04.637 --> 01:09:08.498]  They all sit back and say, well, we got the Constitution, you know, that'll protect us.
[01:09:08.918 --> 01:09:09.898]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[01:09:09.918 --> 01:09:11.539]  Appreciate it.
[01:09:11.639 --> 01:09:13.279]  Mike in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:14.079]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:09:14.699 --> 01:09:15.499]  Good morning.
[01:09:15.579 --> 01:09:16.940]  It's good to hear you on the air.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.440]  I'm listening to you on the Internet.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.020]  Well, good.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:19.680]  Thanks for tuning in.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.281]  Something very disturbing happened to me today, and I wanted to relate it to you.
[01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:28.362]  I drive a bus for a living, and I needed to work out some new routes.
[01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.163]  And I bought this software from Microsoft called Streets 2000.
[01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:39.562]  And I planned out my routes according to the software, and then I printed out the maps.
[01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:45.126]  At the bottom of every map for Microsoft 2000 Streets, you see a little disclaimer.
[01:09:45.146 --> 01:09:49.610]  It says, used with permission from Her Majesty the Queen of England.
[01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:50.731]  Copyright.
[01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:53.212]  Now what do you suppose that's all about?
[01:09:54.834 --> 01:10:00.278]  Well, one of the richest families in the world is the Sox Coburg Gothish.
[01:10:00.538 --> 01:10:01.419]  That's the real name.
[01:10:01.519 --> 01:10:03.020]  Windsor is like a brand name.
[01:10:03.863 --> 01:10:07.547]  The average Brit doesn't even know the name of their British royal family.
[01:10:07.567 --> 01:10:09.990]  That's how dumbed down a population can get.
[01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:19.020]  I don't know about their ownership of that program, but I know that Lockheed Martin up in Fort Worth has now shifted their programming to NATO 3000.
[01:10:21.022 --> 01:10:24.846]  Before they ran off Army programs, everything's going to globalism.
[01:10:25.966 --> 01:10:29.089]  And I don't know about that particular program, but I know this.
[01:10:29.589 --> 01:10:36.135]  The new Microsoft programs are enabled with biometric key access if you want to have that type of keyboard.
[01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:45.362]  And Microsoft spies on its customers and tries to send data back when you turn your computer on to Microsoft.
[01:10:45.543 --> 01:10:47.104]  And they've been caught doing this.
[01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:50.767]  There's just open wholesale spying for the government going on.
[01:10:51.644 --> 01:10:51.965]  Wow.
[01:10:52.185 --> 01:10:53.847]  Welcome to British America, huh?
[01:10:54.068 --> 01:10:58.354]  Well, yeah, and Microsoft wasn't as bad about that until the antitrust suit.
[01:10:58.434 --> 01:11:02.360]  And then as soon as they complied, we're good little globalists, now they're being left alone.
[01:11:03.388 --> 01:11:06.789]  Gates had to put $24 billion of his money, though, into a U.N.
[01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:12.351]  population control fund and vaccine fund for the children, and then they also left him alone.
[01:11:12.611 --> 01:11:15.632]  Like Ted Turner, he had to give a billion to the U.N.
[01:11:15.652 --> 01:11:16.452]  vaccine program.
[01:11:16.532 --> 01:11:20.413]  Once you've done that, once you've paid into the kitty, you can be a little globalist.
[01:11:20.453 --> 01:11:23.894]  But Bill Gates isn't in the top 20 richest people.
[01:11:23.934 --> 01:11:25.395]  He's way down the list.
[01:11:26.512 --> 01:11:36.560]  The Sachs-Coburg-Gothas, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, they're so wealthy, they're tax-exempt, they own literal universities, highway systems, everything.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.622]  They're just opulently rich.
[01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.744]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, and God bless you.
[01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.566]  Anything else you want to talk about?
[01:11:43.586 --> 01:11:45.247]  No, that'll do it.
[01:11:45.287 --> 01:11:45.907]  God bless you.
[01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:47.228]  Thank you for the call.
[01:11:47.248 --> 01:11:51.112]  Before I go to some of the other callers, let me
[01:11:52.210 --> 01:11:54.832]  Get into this news about the economy.
[01:11:54.932 --> 01:11:55.993]  Think about that, though.
[01:11:56.153 --> 01:12:14.325]  Over in England, the population is so divorced from reality, so hyped up on, you know, owning tea sets with the king and queen on it, that they don't even know that it's not even the British people that run the country, not even English, not Scottish, not Irish.
[01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.627]  No, they're German.
[01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:21.330]  They're Saxe-Coburg-Gophers, and they're little cousins of the Bushes, literally.
[01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:24.673]  Reuters is reported directly related.
[01:12:26.274 --> 01:12:28.796]  The Bushes, of course, were Tories in the Revolutionary War.
[01:12:30.537 --> 01:12:33.299]  Now we have a hereditary leadership here, just like they have in North Korea.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.741]  Daddy, you know, gets out, so son takes over.
[01:12:37.302 --> 01:12:51.572]  But to make a long story short, I've been on British Radio, National British Radio, and said, well, you know, the Sox, Coburg, Gophers run your country, and they're German, and the host is, well, we don't talk about that here.
[01:12:52.344 --> 01:12:53.624]  And people call in getting mad.
[01:12:53.864 --> 01:12:59.126]  Well, what do you mean the Queenie isn't English and is German?
[01:12:59.806 --> 01:13:02.187]  And what do you mean their name is Sachs-Kobar-Gotha?
[01:13:02.927 --> 01:13:05.548]  Yeah, that's how mind control people are.
[01:13:05.568 --> 01:13:10.629]  They got these leaders, these rulers, these people that own them, and they don't even know their last names.
[01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:13.730]  That's the control of the real elite in this world.
[01:13:15.311 --> 01:13:18.972]  And the Rothschilds are so powerful you never hear their name, don't know what they own or do.
[01:13:21.623 --> 01:13:22.804]  Same thing with the Rockefellers.
[01:13:22.964 --> 01:13:24.505]  Oh, they don't have money anymore.
[01:13:26.587 --> 01:13:28.768]  So it's amazing.
[01:13:28.948 --> 01:13:30.909]  That's the type of power we're talking about.
[01:13:30.929 --> 01:13:35.533]  They've got their little cousins and third and fourth cousins as our presidents.
[01:13:36.473 --> 01:13:38.535]  It's really a disgusting mess, folks.
[01:13:38.795 --> 01:13:43.678]  And I don't know what to say about it other than, welcome to the New World Order.
[01:13:44.579 --> 01:13:49.262]  And by the way, this currency is going down by design.
[01:13:50.888 --> 01:13:57.630]  Three and a half, almost four years ago, the Davos Switzerland Economic Forum, they said they were going to plunge our dollar.
[01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:01.691]  And the last two Treasury Secretaries have bad-mouthed the dollar.
[01:14:02.411 --> 01:14:07.553]  And Greenspan has bad-mouthed the economy now, because they want to blow the economy out.
[01:14:07.593 --> 01:14:09.313]  They want to restrict the money supply.
[01:14:09.693 --> 01:14:13.014]  They're calling in the old 20s, and the 50s, and the 10s, and the 5s.
[01:14:13.294 --> 01:14:18.235]  They're going to issue less of the new colored money, which is now hitting the streets.
[01:14:18.856 --> 01:14:20.056]  You may get the new pink,
[01:14:21.738 --> 01:14:24.439]  Twenties today, when you're out banking.
[01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:26.760]  In fact, I've now seen them.
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.760]  They started getting released today.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.421]  They got rolled out in March 27th.
[01:14:31.761 --> 01:14:39.523]  And they're getting you ready for the cashless society, slumping dollar, sturge, policy debate.
[01:14:41.024 --> 01:14:45.225]  And it turns out that our government has been out bad-mouthing the dollar.
[01:14:45.425 --> 01:14:48.386]  And you're like, wait, America's fighting with Europe right now.
[01:14:48.466 --> 01:14:49.126]  We went into
[01:14:50.023 --> 01:14:54.266]  We went into Iraq because they were going to the gold standard.
[01:14:54.306 --> 01:14:55.507]  We couldn't allow that.
[01:14:55.748 --> 01:14:56.708]  Well, Europe couldn't.
[01:14:57.089 --> 01:14:58.089]  We're mad at Europe.
[01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:59.430]  No, it's totally staged.
[01:14:59.551 --> 01:15:03.113]  Europe is playing the part with the UN as the good cop.
[01:15:03.494 --> 01:15:04.935]  We're playing the part of the bad cop.
[01:15:04.975 --> 01:15:06.556]  We're all owned by the same people.
[01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.359]  Slumping dollar stirs policy debate.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:18.946]  Latest comments on Treasury Snow raise questions about how low currency may go.
[01:15:20.456 --> 01:15:33.284]  And it says, Los Angeles, the dollar slumped Monday to a new multi-year low against major rivals after Treasury Secretary John Snow indicated the Bush administration is happy with the help the falling currency provides U.S.
[01:15:33.364 --> 01:15:33.904]  exporters.
[01:15:35.725 --> 01:15:40.668]  Now you talk about la-la land, 80 plus percent of our industry has been exported.
[01:15:41.809 --> 01:15:43.810]  The service industries are shutting down.
[01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:45.551]  This is horrible for the economy.
[01:15:46.092 --> 01:15:46.612]  Horrible
[01:15:47.887 --> 01:16:02.218]  When you have a 45 plus billion dollar trade deficit just last month alone, it's in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions a year, is ballooning out of control, and they say a dropping dollar is good?
[01:16:02.238 --> 01:16:11.105]  That's all we had left, was our strong reserve fiat currency, because we had better buying power for the slave goods.
[01:16:11.746 --> 01:16:14.888]  That could mean there will be no stopping the dollar's decline anytime soon.
[01:16:18.354 --> 01:16:29.179]  Baltimore Sun says, that could mean there will be no stopping the dollar's decline anytime soon, some analysts said, which would be welcome news for manufacturers in California and across the nation, as the currency slide marks U.S.
[01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:30.199]  goods cheaper abroad.
[01:16:30.999 --> 01:16:38.283]  Yeah, but the communist Chinese can't buy any of our goods and we don't make toasters and microwaves and washers and dryers.
[01:16:38.763 --> 01:16:41.384]  This is incredible propaganda!
[01:16:44.548 --> 01:16:46.769]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:51.551]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:16:51.831 --> 01:16:57.634]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:16:57.874 --> 01:17:01.915]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:07.398]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:09.119]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.582]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:17:16.622 --> 01:17:19.003]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:21.644]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:17:22.025 --> 01:17:25.646]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.

[01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.630]  I think so.
[01:20:46.301 --> 01:20:52.325]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:52.945 --> 01:20:55.967]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:59.150]  Let me boil this down simply.
[01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:08.836]  Almost four years ago, the Davos Economic World Forum in Switzerland, with the Treasury Secretaries from all over the Western world, said they were going to plunge the dollar
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:16.047]  Greenspan said it, his envoy did, and they said this is part of their global plan to make Europe shine.
[01:21:16.507 --> 01:21:28.099]  To legitimize the Euro, to get everybody behind it, to get England to join in and say, oh look, this regional model works, and then Bush will say, or whoever's in office next, we need a Pan-American Union, which they're already forming, but then they'll announce.
[01:21:28.962 --> 01:21:33.746]  We've got to team up to compete with them when it's all owned by the same shareholders.
[01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:45.597]  They said they'd do it, and now here's a Baltimore Sun saying Bush and Snow and all of them, the Treasury Secretary, are bad-mouthing the dollar and saying, oh, well, this is good for us.
[01:21:46.317 --> 01:21:48.559]  Everyone will buy our goods now that they can.
[01:21:48.579 --> 01:21:52.042]  Yeah, China with a 40-plus percent tariff on us.
[01:21:52.543 --> 01:21:55.005]  We've got almost no tariff on them, all the slave labor.
[01:21:55.746 --> 01:21:58.888]  And then the dollar goes down some and they think, oh, they're going to be buying all our goods.
[01:21:58.908 --> 01:21:59.928]  That's not why they're doing this.
[01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.810]  They're doing it by design to destroy this country.
[01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:05.351]  And that's just public information.
[01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:07.212]  They publicly said it.
[01:22:07.652 --> 01:22:11.334]  I've been saying it for three and a half years and guaranteeing it, but they said it.
[01:22:11.614 --> 01:22:15.036]  These guys have policy reports where they say what they're going to do to us.
[01:22:15.536 --> 01:22:17.277]  They're out in the open with their programs.
[01:22:18.492 --> 01:22:27.920]  The Project for the American Century says they're going to attack this person and that person and they'll be, quote, Pearl Harbor events are needed and catastrophic events to get us behind this war.
[01:22:28.781 --> 01:22:41.291]  It goes on and on and on and on and they have policy reports that are public about what they're going to do to the dollar three and a half years ago, but it's never in the big news until it starts actually happening.
[01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:44.617]  People say, how do you know all this, Alex?
[01:22:44.657 --> 01:22:46.158]  How do you understand them so well?
[01:22:46.578 --> 01:22:47.979]  Well, it's a big organization.
[01:22:48.019 --> 01:22:49.380]  They communicate with each other.
[01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:52.603]  Then they prepare you with propaganda on the news.
[01:22:52.963 --> 01:22:55.005]  So I always know exactly where they're going.
[01:22:57.887 --> 01:22:59.628]  That's why I'm so afraid of a dirty bomb.
[01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:03.211]  I mean, the way they've been advertising dirty bomb and smallpox, look out, folks.
[01:23:03.231 --> 01:23:05.153]  I mean, they like to tell you what they're going to do before they do it.
[01:23:06.234 --> 01:23:07.074]  So it's amazing.
[01:23:08.195 --> 01:23:10.497]  Yesterday, I mentioned that I heard a news report
[01:23:12.371 --> 01:23:17.693]  That they had a warrant for the arrest of a whole bunch of Democrats in the state legislature.
[01:23:18.314 --> 01:23:21.355]  And of course, Democrats will stay till Bill dies.
[01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.515]  This is out of the Austin American-Statesman.
[01:23:23.556 --> 01:23:27.177]  Partisan fire engulfs Perry's plea for civility.
[01:23:28.077 --> 01:23:38.341]  And 50-something Democrats went to a little town in Oklahoma because they're basically staging their own filibuster, kind of, where they don't have to
[01:23:39.406 --> 01:23:43.471]  Vote on redistricting and a bunch of other stuff, what they call a federal power grab.
[01:23:44.732 --> 01:23:48.216]  In the midst of the House Democrat historic walkout, Republican Governor Rick Perry
[01:23:49.275 --> 01:23:53.236]  Himself, former House Democrat, decided to walk in.
[01:23:53.256 --> 01:24:09.162]  Monday night on the floor of the chamber, where three months ago he praised its tradition of civility, Perry opened partisan fire on the Democrats who took a road trip across the Red River to block a vote on GOP-backed congressional redistricting map.
[01:24:09.762 --> 01:24:15.744]  Perry pulled out the heavy rhetorical ammo, including coward, childish, and irresponsible.
[01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:25.174]  At that moment it was clear that Perry saddened with either the misfortune or the opportunity of being governor at the most partisan moment in Texas history.
[01:24:25.735 --> 01:24:28.617]  Legislative history had decided on his role.
[01:24:30.019 --> 01:24:32.962]  This is not the most partisan time in Texas history.
[01:24:33.022 --> 01:24:38.628]  Two northern governors who were installed were removed after the Civil War
[01:24:39.947 --> 01:24:42.609]  At gunpoint from the Capitol.
[01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:43.130]  Okay?
[01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:47.854]  So this is not the most partisan moment in Texas history.
[01:24:48.194 --> 01:24:55.200]  And the Democrats are conniving and do not like what's happening in Texas.
[01:24:56.201 --> 01:24:57.862]  And I'm not a fan of Texas Democrats.
[01:24:57.882 --> 01:24:59.103]  Let me be honest with you.
[01:24:59.123 --> 01:25:00.745]  I've been a Republican all my life.
[01:25:00.765 --> 01:25:02.506]  I'm just not a modern neo kind.
[01:25:02.966 --> 01:25:04.388]  And Perry's a big government pimp.
[01:25:04.468 --> 01:25:05.909]  Well, you heard it, the former Democrat.
[01:25:06.892 --> 01:25:15.493]  But the Democrats are wrong in what they're doing, but this is good overall because it's a separation of powers.
[01:25:15.976 --> 01:25:32.542]  The Founding Fathers didn't say the legislative, the executive, the judicial would all be good, but that with different strongmen and different elites fighting with each other at the lower and mid-levels, this would stop dictatorship or a steamroller takeover from taking place.
[01:25:32.902 --> 01:25:43.026]  The very nature of the bureaucracy set up by the Founding Fathers is very resilient and blocks quick change, which is the big enemy of a free society.
[01:25:44.731 --> 01:25:50.736]  In a democracy, 51% can say, uh, let's kill Alex Jones.
[01:25:52.197 --> 01:25:59.663]  But in a republic, you have a rule of law, and the minority as well as the majority's rights are protected, and you have a separation of powers.
[01:26:00.003 --> 01:26:02.585]  Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:26:02.965 --> 01:26:05.067]  It is mob rule engineered by the elites.
[01:26:05.831 --> 01:26:08.293]  That's why we don't want to call this country a democracy.
[01:26:08.713 --> 01:26:09.954]  We're not a democracy.
[01:26:10.315 --> 01:26:16.119]  In a democracy, if 51% say all black people or all white people are slaves, it happens.
[01:26:16.599 --> 01:26:21.103]  In a republic, you have a rule of law, a constitution, and there's a supreme law of the land.
[01:26:21.503 --> 01:26:29.009]  That's why it's dangerous to have the governments at all levels ignoring the Constitution Bill of Rights, and at the same time, trying to centralize control.
[01:26:29.069 --> 01:26:30.771]  We'll be back with your calls in a guest.
[01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:31.171]  Stay with us.
[01:26:34.145 --> 01:26:35.045]  We're on the march.
[01:26:35.525 --> 01:26:37.146]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:38.046 --> 01:26:40.826]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:44.227 --> 01:26:48.108]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:53.769]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:26:54.049 --> 01:26:56.450]  Ideal for tri... 803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:57.130]  That's triple eight.
[01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:58.030]  803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:27:18.547 --> 01:27:26.688]  Join us on air 1-800-259-9231 on this 5 Wednesday edition.
[01:27:27.549 --> 01:27:32.389]  Do you understand out there how serious it is to have the dollar dropping through the floor?
[01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:38.050]  All we had was our world reserve currency status with this fiat system.
[01:27:38.431 --> 01:27:40.051]  The world traded in dollars.
[01:27:40.431 --> 01:27:44.552]  The dollar was of the highest value in the exchange markets.
[01:27:44.832 --> 01:27:46.672]  Remember how you could go to Mexico and
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:52.001]  Buy double with it, triple with it, depending on what the exchange rate was.
[01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:56.001]  You know, two dollars could buy you and your whole family a big meal.
[01:27:56.602 --> 01:27:59.122]  For ten bucks you could buy a nice piece of furniture.
[01:28:00.002 --> 01:28:07.843]  Well, when your currency plunges, then it takes more, and that robs the money that you had in the bank.
[01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:13.144]  And really it's a form of inflation.
[01:28:13.684 --> 01:28:16.685]  Domestically they're saying, oh, we don't have inflation because
[01:28:17.342 --> 01:28:20.785]  Milk and eggs stays the same price, but look at the price of those cars and housing.
[01:28:20.825 --> 01:28:21.746]  We do have inflation.
[01:28:22.567 --> 01:28:24.609]  And then they tell you, oh, we don't have inflation.
[01:28:24.889 --> 01:28:30.875]  Well, globally we do, because now the dollar won't buy as much.
[01:28:32.156 --> 01:28:42.226]  The dollar is trading at about 27 cents against all the major currencies of what it was just a year ago.
[01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:46.288]  And England has told the public doesn't want to go to the Euro.
[01:28:47.129 --> 01:28:48.729]  The pound is tied to the dollar.
[01:28:48.749 --> 01:28:52.551]  Now they're going to have to and go ahead and accept globalism.
[01:28:54.012 --> 01:29:02.416]  And you've got the White House saying this is a good thing and you've had Greenspan and Snow and O'Neill before him bad-mouthing the currency.
[01:29:02.516 --> 01:29:11.040]  I mean, I remember watching O'Neill last year before he left bad-mouthing the dollar before the committees in Congress
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:22.343]  And hearing this, I was stunned, but I really shouldn't have been stunned because years before that, I saw the Davos Switzerland comments about how it was over for America.
[01:29:23.354 --> 01:29:23.914]  That's okay.
[01:29:23.934 --> 01:29:25.755]  You'll still be patriotic, because you're good.
[01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:31.658]  You'll still wave that plastic Chinese slave flag, because everything the flag symbolizes disappears.
[01:29:32.199 --> 01:29:47.487]  And meanwhile, here in Texas, they arrested a couple of Democrats in the state yesterday, House members of the legislature, and they're trying to arrest 50-plus up in Oklahoma, but don't have jurisdiction, so they had a private jet there waiting to load the Democrats on.
[01:29:47.527 --> 01:29:48.087]  They wouldn't go.
[01:29:49.337 --> 01:29:51.758]  A bunch of bizarreness going on on that front.
[01:29:52.238 --> 01:29:54.618]  Larry in Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:29:55.039 --> 01:30:06.822]  Alex, I was trying to find out, I haven't heard yet, this new dollar, red money, pink, whatever it is, is this the one, does it have the tracking chip in it that is capable of scanning on every transaction?
[01:30:07.182 --> 01:30:10.042]  Well, the money six years ago did, Larry.
[01:30:10.502 --> 01:30:16.144]  It all has the RFID cracker strip in it, and it supposedly has more of those.
[01:30:16.804 --> 01:30:17.104]  Right.
[01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:21.267]  And it's blue, dark green, and pink.
[01:30:21.927 --> 01:30:23.268]  That's just the 20's.
[01:30:23.929 --> 01:30:27.031]  They're saying the 10's are going to be fire engine red.
[01:30:27.051 --> 01:30:27.131]  Okay.
[01:30:28.932 --> 01:30:29.993]  And it's real nice.
[01:30:30.173 --> 01:30:32.274]  So this is probably a new enhanced chip.
[01:30:32.574 --> 01:30:38.058]  So I figure if I take my ATM card to the bank and put it in and say give me a hundred bucks, it'll come back with my name on it.
[01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:46.063]  Then I go across the street and buy a lawnmower for my neighbor with a hundred bucks, and he gives it to his kid and tells him to go to the store and get some groceries.
[01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:51.172]  Well, his kid goes to the local dope dealer and cashes it in, gets a little change for a little local dope.
[01:30:52.172 --> 01:30:54.253]  Then he goes to the store and goes back, Dad, don't know nothing.
[01:30:54.273 --> 01:30:55.573]  Then the dope dealer gets busted.
[01:30:56.033 --> 01:30:58.034]  Then I bought dope, huh?
[01:30:58.194 --> 01:31:02.856]  Well, let me stop you, Larry, because I'm going to be doing a presentation in Kansas City this Saturday.
[01:31:03.576 --> 01:31:12.199]  At the start of my presentation, at the end of my PowerPoint presentation, I talk about let the rumors end and the documentation begin.
[01:31:12.279 --> 01:31:13.919]  Now, obviously, you've been listening for years.
[01:31:14.439 --> 01:31:16.060]  You know what you're talking about, but you're not
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:17.581]  Speculating.
[01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:23.565]  You need to make that clear when you tell a neighbor or a friend or a family that, you know, you said, is the strip in it?
[01:31:23.966 --> 01:31:26.467]  Well, I said 500 times on this show, conservatively.
[01:31:27.328 --> 01:31:36.896]  It's the Federal Reserve Policy Board of Virginia has said that in the change in 98, that all the new money above a dollar, 5, 10s, 20s, 50s, 100s, 1000s,
[01:31:39.546 --> 01:31:40.888]  Have the tracking strip in it.
[01:31:40.908 --> 01:31:42.370]  You can pull the tracking strip out.
[01:31:42.891 --> 01:31:46.796]  They say that the police and airports and others have scanners to pick up money.
[01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:50.830]  It is a radio frequency identification tag.
[01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:54.331]  They can now get these down to the size of a grain of sand.
[01:31:54.892 --> 01:31:57.032]  They can hold massive amounts of data.
[01:31:57.052 --> 01:31:58.013]  They're washable.
[01:31:58.413 --> 01:32:04.615]  The cell towers scan and ping off of them the identifying tracker number.
[01:32:04.655 --> 01:32:06.236]  Now that's Forbes.
[01:32:06.936 --> 01:32:08.336]  That's Washington Post.
[01:32:08.376 --> 01:32:09.597]  That's USA Today.
[01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:11.558]  That's the Federal Reserve.
[01:32:11.598 --> 01:32:13.458]  That's the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[01:32:13.918 --> 01:32:14.279]  That's CNN.
[01:32:15.885 --> 01:32:20.529]  So when you talk about this scary tracking of the money, yes, they are going to make a law.
[01:32:20.609 --> 01:32:21.870]  They said this three years ago.
[01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:24.012]  They said within five years they want a law.
[01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:26.393]  Now the colored money is coming out, getting you ready for changes.
[01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:29.216]  By the time you're done, there'll be no cash.
[01:32:29.936 --> 01:32:31.678]  Everything will be ATMs and banks.
[01:32:31.718 --> 01:32:39.524]  You will get a strip with a strip on it that will be your money, just paper with a strip on it.
[01:32:40.487 --> 01:32:47.650]  With your name, what you've bought, what you do, and if you don't turn your cash into the bank, they are going to devalue it off the strip.
[01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:53.252]  Part of the strip cannot be erased, when that money was issued, what denomination it is.
[01:32:53.632 --> 01:32:59.854]  The other part of the strip, they say 90% of the current strip, is for data to be scanned on.
[01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:11.773]  Okay, so yes, it is to follow the transactions, making paper money, actually cotton money, it's fabric money, a cashless society data grid.
[01:33:12.613 --> 01:33:13.733]  So it's digitizing it.
[01:33:14.134 --> 01:33:16.514]  Well, no more private business.
[01:33:16.594 --> 01:33:18.114]  I think that's America.
[01:33:18.654 --> 01:33:22.895]  Since it's a private corporation, it just makes the money and issues it anyway.
[01:33:22.915 --> 01:33:24.236]  That must be America.
[01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:25.716]  Have a good day, Alex.
[01:33:29.577 --> 01:33:30.917]  I can trace everything you do.
[01:33:32.014 --> 01:33:37.738]  Every purchase you make, every call you make, and they're wanting us to announce this to scare you.
[01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:39.800]  So there's a chilling effect.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.261]  They haven't put it all in place yet.
[01:33:41.281 --> 01:33:41.841]  They're trying.
[01:33:42.562 --> 01:33:43.842]  But let me explain something.
[01:33:44.783 --> 01:33:55.611]  They could have 10 million people working at the NSA for Echelon and the new name they've given it, Total Information Awareness Network, with the convicted felon Admiral John Poindexter running it.
[01:33:56.351 --> 01:33:59.954]  They do not have the personnel to do anything to you.
[01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:04.470]  They only have the personnel later to turn your card off.
[01:34:05.251 --> 01:34:08.992]  To deny the entire public their money just like Argentina.
[01:34:09.852 --> 01:34:10.933]  That's the system.
[01:34:11.233 --> 01:34:16.255]  And to issue you your federal cash creds on what will be called multi-pass.
[01:34:17.515 --> 01:34:19.396]  Your multi-pass system.
[01:34:21.037 --> 01:34:22.817]  Alright, who's up next?
[01:34:24.598 --> 01:34:26.779]  Ted in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:34:27.299 --> 01:34:29.320]  Hey Alex, thank you for having me on.
[01:34:30.534 --> 01:34:33.457]  You're doing an excellent job, excellent job on the dollar too.
[01:34:34.338 --> 01:34:39.041]  I'd like to say something on the dollar, but I'd like to say something very briefly on the internet first.
[01:34:40.122 --> 01:34:57.016]  I think that the RIAA, I believe it is, the Recording Industry Association, I believe that they have, I believe Edgar Brantman,
[01:34:57.928 --> 01:35:01.169]  One of the heads of that has threatened to destroy the Internet if necessary.
[01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:05.091]  I'm not concerned with downloading music.
[01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:06.131]  I don't download music.
[01:35:06.151 --> 01:35:07.812]  I don't think it's worth downloading most of it.
[01:35:09.553 --> 01:35:24.439]  But I think that at the present time, I'm getting such an increase in spam and the quality of spam that I'm getting is so deplorable that I'm wondering, I'm not accusing, but I'm
[01:35:25.023 --> 01:35:28.565]  Raising the question as to whether or not somebody is trying to destroy the Internet.
[01:35:30.866 --> 01:35:31.266]  You with me?
[01:35:31.466 --> 01:35:39.890]  We know that every time the Feds introduce new draconian Internet legislation, hack attacks are launched legitimizing it.
[01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:41.370]  They've been tracked back to the government.
[01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:45.532]  Our government also contracts with Chinese China to hack attack our own systems.
[01:35:46.152 --> 01:35:49.074]  Russia was given the download codes to many of our government's computers.
[01:35:49.654 --> 01:35:52.075]  Microsoft gave the code to Russia and China.
[01:35:53.311 --> 01:35:54.291]  So, that is happening.
[01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:57.672]  They've opened the doors to create the crisis.
[01:35:58.412 --> 01:36:04.753]  Then when there's massive hack attacks, they come in and make it where if you send somebody the wrong email, you get life in prison.
[01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:08.034]  And that's the Washington Post headline a few months ago.
[01:36:08.194 --> 01:36:09.294]  That's not Alex Jones.
[01:36:10.054 --> 01:36:10.694]  So, yes.
[01:36:11.534 --> 01:36:11.954]  Always.
[01:36:12.034 --> 01:36:15.075]  They ship the drugs in, create the crisis, imprison all our youth.
[01:36:15.335 --> 01:36:18.416]  They build widgets, 25 cents an hour, in a FEMA camp.
[01:36:19.396 --> 01:36:20.696]  They create the hack attacks.
[01:36:21.548 --> 01:36:27.733]  Give China and Russia the codes, publicly, pay them to launch attacks, shut things down.
[01:36:28.313 --> 01:36:28.994]  And it's clear.
[01:36:29.074 --> 01:36:31.436]  They want to start taxing, regulating, controlling the net.
[01:36:31.476 --> 01:36:32.557]  They do plan to do it.
[01:36:33.337 --> 01:36:34.438]  It is too out of control.
[01:36:34.498 --> 01:36:37.040]  They plan to use it as a cashless society control grid.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.561]  It's a double-edged sword.
[01:36:38.981 --> 01:36:40.543]  It has gotten out of hand for them.
[01:36:41.263 --> 01:36:43.905]  And it's a very serious issue.
[01:36:44.686 --> 01:36:46.267]  And you're absolutely on target.
[01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:51.271]  Let me make one comment, not a comment, but a question on the dollar.
[01:36:53.357 --> 01:36:55.458]  Gold might be one answer to it.
[01:36:56.799 --> 01:37:03.204]  What are the other solutions to hedging against the loss of value of the dollar?
[01:37:03.564 --> 01:37:04.424]  Well, let's be honest.
[01:37:04.464 --> 01:37:07.747]  When you asked me about gold, the folks that own this network sell gold.
[01:37:08.827 --> 01:37:16.653]  And I will tell you I've bought gold from them because they're in the lower end of pricing and I know they're private and I know I can trust them.
[01:37:17.313 --> 01:37:21.376]  So, I personally have been buying gold now about every two months I buy some more gold
[01:37:23.082 --> 01:37:24.482]  And I believe gold's good.
[01:37:25.042 --> 01:37:26.523]  Paying off your debts is good.
[01:37:26.743 --> 01:37:28.663]  Owning some land where you can garden.
[01:37:28.803 --> 01:37:30.043]  Having storable foods.
[01:37:30.504 --> 01:37:32.644]  Investing some of your money in water filters.
[01:37:32.684 --> 01:37:34.344]  And yes, we sell those and we sell the best.
[01:37:34.704 --> 01:37:36.685]  No sponsors, but get water filters, period.
[01:37:38.345 --> 01:37:39.325]  Camping supplies.
[01:37:39.445 --> 01:37:40.246]  Firearms.
[01:37:41.406 --> 01:37:45.967]  I would invest in educating people to stop this, or at least let folks know who's behind it.
[01:37:46.447 --> 01:37:50.388]  That can derail their really aggressive swing they're in right now.
[01:37:50.768 --> 01:37:52.368]  Part of the agenda phase they're in.
[01:37:53.591 --> 01:37:56.333]  Uh, you can obviously, gold stocks are good.
[01:37:56.353 --> 01:37:59.354]  We don't sell gold stocks, obviously, but those gold stocks are out there.
[01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:03.977]  Uh, platinum, uh, palladium, all these go up and down.
[01:38:04.017 --> 01:38:09.740]  It's still gambling, just like, uh, the stock market, but a little bit more base in reality.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.263]  Well, you're gambling... Kind of like blackjack, it's a little bit better bet, you know, ask, uh, Bennett.
[01:38:14.783 --> 01:38:16.604]  You're gambling even if you hold onto dollars.
[01:38:17.379 --> 01:38:24.262]  Oh, I mean, I've got some dollars in the bank just for business, but I mean, I'm ready to lose all of it.
[01:38:24.322 --> 01:38:25.223]  I mean, I know that.
[01:38:26.023 --> 01:38:29.285]  And so I would be diversified, always diversified.
[01:38:29.305 --> 01:38:32.846]  And that means don't be all in the stock market, diversified in stocks.
[01:38:33.247 --> 01:38:39.169]  That means have some gold, try to pay off your debts, have some land, have some friends, have some skills.
[01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:40.890]  There's other forms of currency.
[01:38:42.151 --> 01:38:43.772]  Family, friends you can trust.
[01:38:43.832 --> 01:38:46.213]  That's more valuable than all the gold in the mountains.
[01:38:47.996 --> 01:38:49.357]  Let me mention one thing to you.
[01:38:50.817 --> 01:39:16.072]  On this subject of democracy, I'm changing subject again, on the subject of democracy, which I consider that you have a hang-up on, I agree with everything you say concerning the democracy republic thing, but I think that you have made an unusual, you have an unusual insight into the command and control boiling down the different
[01:39:16.516 --> 01:39:17.036]  I don't know.
[01:39:34.905 --> 01:39:42.570]  Well, Dr. Dennis Cuddy, who we've got coming back on Friday, did state that, and there are others that understand it.
[01:39:43.191 --> 01:39:45.672]  They know you want choices, so they give you.
[01:39:45.732 --> 01:39:50.436]  You want fascism, you want communism, you want socialism, you want... when really it's all command and control.
[01:39:50.796 --> 01:39:55.279]  It's like the choice of, okay, there is a new world order, will it be liberal or conservative?
[01:39:55.359 --> 01:39:59.041]  And then they bypass the debate of, we don't want a new world order.
[01:39:59.061 --> 01:40:01.323]  So it's all about bypassing debate, giving
[01:40:01.943 --> 01:40:14.530]  I think that that probably, from what I understand, might be a version of what they call the dialectic, Hegel's dialectic.
[01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:15.531]  Oh no, that's it.
[01:40:15.771 --> 01:40:17.151]  That's what Cuddy said, yes.
[01:40:17.992 --> 01:40:25.336]  And I think that that same dialectic can be applied to this subject of democracy versus republic.
[01:40:25.856 --> 01:40:29.138]  After all, the republic read China as a republic.
[01:40:30.001 --> 01:40:33.722]  And even Soviet Russia was a republic.
[01:40:34.402 --> 01:40:36.102]  Well, they call themselves republics.
[01:40:36.162 --> 01:40:43.503]  By republic, we mean a constitutional republic where you have a rule of law, state bill of rights and constitutions, federal constitution, bill of rights.
[01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:49.424]  And we mean the pure democracy of 51% say kill all the Eskimos.
[01:40:49.584 --> 01:40:54.245]  No, you can't do that at 51% say because we have a rule of law in this republic.
[01:40:54.645 --> 01:40:58.346]  I'm saying when they promote a pure democracy, it's very dangerous.
[01:40:59.051 --> 01:41:06.174]  Well, I agree with that, but I don't define... I don't restrict the term democracy to a pure democracy.
[01:41:06.194 --> 01:41:08.715]  I have a concept which I call a true democracy.
[01:41:08.795 --> 01:41:14.277]  I know, but when the media promotes it, and the Republicans and Democrats mantra it, they're talking about a pure democracy.
[01:41:14.557 --> 01:41:19.639]  Or where they do horrible things and say, oh, you voted for this, you can't complain.
[01:41:20.399 --> 01:41:23.600]  There's a whole bypassing of constitutional issues.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.001]  They use that to manipulate our thinking.
[01:41:26.932 --> 01:41:37.020]  And I think that I'm for the Constitution, but such a thing as a Jeffersonian democracy, I don't know that it's a solution at all.
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:49.569]  Well, Jeffersonian's democracy that he was talking about within the Republic would be educated yeoman farmers going in and serving a stint in the legislature.
[01:41:50.009 --> 01:41:55.974]  He was talking about the general public being part of the Republic and being part of the power process.
[01:41:56.508 --> 01:41:58.870]  Right, so you have representative government.
[01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:10.300]  If you go above the democracy and the republic, you have a concept of representative government, which should be, certainly is more desirable than totalitarian government.
[01:42:11.661 --> 01:42:21.669]  In either form, either democracy or a republic, a representative government.
[01:42:23.717 --> 01:42:25.538]  Let me tell you how democracy works.
[01:42:26.719 --> 01:42:29.441]  Caesar says, the people want me to be their god.
[01:42:29.901 --> 01:42:36.446]  He walks out to a throng of 50,000 in the square, yells to them, do you want to go to war with Gaul?
[01:42:36.466 --> 01:42:39.568]  Do you want the greater glory of Rome?
[01:42:39.608 --> 01:42:43.091]  And the crowd, of course there's centurions around, if you don't scream you're going to get it.
[01:42:43.471 --> 01:42:44.151]  They all go, yeah!
[01:42:45.352 --> 01:42:49.695]  Don't you think you're doing the same thing with the Democracy Republic
[01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:27.372]  Well, what I mean by the dictatorship is, you get the same thing with the democracy.
[01:43:27.672 --> 01:43:31.214]  It always races into tyranny.
[01:43:31.574 --> 01:43:35.256]  I mean, you get the dictatorship out of democracy in shorthand.
[01:43:35.736 --> 01:43:36.477]  I understand that.
[01:43:38.618 --> 01:43:43.440]  It depends on the type of democracy, but I think that you can have a republic
[01:43:44.119 --> 01:43:55.687]  And call it a democracy as long as you take all the ignorant people out of the electorate and take all the... Yeah, but that's never going to happen.
[01:43:55.747 --> 01:43:57.488]  So, and again, that's discriminatory.
[01:43:58.009 --> 01:44:00.830]  We have got, well I'm serious, you can't do that.
[01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:01.591]  Who's going to decide?
[01:44:01.931 --> 01:44:07.595]  The idiots, there's more idiots than smart people, they'll get together and say the smart people are crazy and can't vote.
[01:44:07.615 --> 01:44:12.478]  Like the Soviet Union, you're crazy because you say our government's corrupt, when really you're the smart guy.
[01:44:14.491 --> 01:44:17.812]  You can't stomp on anybody's rights or they're going to stomp on yours.
[01:44:17.972 --> 01:44:30.357]  I do think, I'm positive, I'm not positive, but I'm convinced that the Hegel dialectic can be applied to other things other than just the ones that you applied to.
[01:44:30.377 --> 01:44:31.138]  Yeah, terrorism.
[01:44:31.818 --> 01:44:33.018]  It's applied to everything.
[01:44:33.118 --> 01:44:33.739]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:34.499 --> 01:44:34.879]  I hear you.
[01:44:34.899 --> 01:44:35.399]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:35.439 --> 01:44:36.300]  We'll break and come back.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.420]  We do have another guest coming up.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.641]  More of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:44:43.170 --> 01:44:46.093]  And I'll get into, oh man, there's a bunch of other news.
[01:44:46.633 --> 01:44:51.037]  Central bankers claim on Euro now at 130 versus the dollar.
[01:44:51.097 --> 01:44:52.178]  That's Forbes headline.
[01:44:52.498 --> 01:44:55.340]  Trade gap widens to 43.5 billion.
[01:44:55.841 --> 01:44:56.501]  It's out of Reuters.
[01:44:56.541 --> 01:44:58.423]  That's in March, folks.
[01:44:58.663 --> 01:44:59.824]  In March alone.
[01:44:59.884 --> 01:45:03.267]  We'll talk about drones over the cities, too.
[01:45:04.975 --> 01:45:08.456]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:45:08.716 --> 01:45:12.218]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:45:12.318 --> 01:45:16.259]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:45:16.479 --> 01:45:22.641]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:45:23.041 --> 01:45:30.964]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:45:31.364 --> 01:45:36.728]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:45:36.888 --> 01:45:40.651]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:45:41.011 --> 01:45:42.893]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[01:45:42.933 --> 01:45:45.095]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[01:47:07.253 --> 01:47:08.534]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:47:08.734 --> 01:47:14.497]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:47:14.757 --> 01:47:20.019]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.

[01:47:28.684 --> 01:47:33.286]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:47:33.626 --> 01:47:39.649]  It's on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:47:39.689 --> 01:47:41.570]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.781]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:48:09.263 --> 01:48:21.848]  Robert Fisk, who has been in Baghdad the last few months and is now in Lebanon, was scheduled, as they say in England, to join us and we talked to him.
[01:48:21.868 --> 01:48:23.488]  He is breaking a major story.
[01:48:23.508 --> 01:48:24.369]  He apologized.
[01:48:24.389 --> 01:48:24.709]  He said,
[01:48:25.467 --> 01:48:27.988]  Give me another 45 minutes and I'll come on.
[01:48:28.048 --> 01:48:28.908]  He said, I'm so sorry.
[01:48:28.928 --> 01:48:29.569]  This is a big story.
[01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:30.369]  I've got a deadline.
[01:48:30.929 --> 01:48:33.830]  It's like 8 o'clock at night right now.
[01:48:34.491 --> 01:48:36.051]  Over there, he's been working all day.
[01:48:36.091 --> 01:48:37.872]  He is coming on sometime in the next hour.
[01:48:38.692 --> 01:48:39.733]  And he apologized.
[01:48:39.953 --> 01:48:42.174]  But he'll be coming on sometime in the next hour.
[01:48:42.194 --> 01:48:44.215]  And if not, he'll of course be on tomorrow.
[01:48:44.275 --> 01:48:45.095]  We're going to get him.
[01:48:45.415 --> 01:48:49.056]  Most highly decorated foreign correspondent.
[01:48:49.116 --> 01:48:51.177]  This guy has all these awards.
[01:48:51.217 --> 01:48:52.758]  He's really done a lot of dangerous reporting.
[01:48:53.482 --> 01:48:55.124]  And believe me, you're going to want to hear what he has to say.
[01:48:55.144 --> 01:48:58.888]  We've got some of his columns posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:07.297]  Your calls are coming up in the next hour, and the toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:07.357 --> 01:49:07.597]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:16.337 --> 01:49:19.479]  Coming up, I do want to get into the trade gap, widens to $43.5 billion.
[01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:25.201]  Folks, just 10 years ago, we had a yearly trade deficit of $40 billion a year.
[01:49:25.381 --> 01:49:26.842]  It's $43.5 billion a month.
[01:49:27.242 --> 01:49:28.683]  It's well over now.
[01:49:28.703 --> 01:49:30.704]  It was $100 billion a year last year with China.
[01:49:31.084 --> 01:49:35.306]  This year, it's going for $180 billion in a year.
[01:49:35.446 --> 01:49:37.127]  I mean, I don't even know how this is possible.
[01:49:37.267 --> 01:49:39.328]  Most of the deficit is obviously with China.
[01:49:40.692 --> 01:49:41.673]  Totally insane.
[01:49:41.733 --> 01:49:43.334]  We manufacture almost nothing here.
[01:49:43.454 --> 01:49:48.577]  Everybody from Dell to IBM to you name it is moving to China.
[01:49:48.677 --> 01:49:51.579]  And then Bush says, oh, the drop in dollars is going to help our manufacturing.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:52.820]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.522]  And the Easter bunnies co-piloting the Mars rocket.
[01:49:56.562 --> 01:50:00.625]  I mean, it's just totally and completely made up.
[01:50:01.125 --> 01:50:01.405]  U.S.
[01:50:01.445 --> 01:50:03.547]  vigilantes test drones on Mexican borders.
[01:50:03.927 --> 01:50:06.629]  My good buddies I've had on the show before
[01:50:08.022 --> 01:50:11.765]  Uh, is down there with drones, American Border Patrol.
[01:50:11.785 --> 01:50:13.846]  And they call it a vigilante group.
[01:50:13.906 --> 01:50:17.169]  I mean, Glenn Spencer's been on all the national news shows.
[01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:18.450]  They go out there with cameras.
[01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:19.891]  They videotape what's happening.
[01:50:19.911 --> 01:50:27.978]  They don't even make arrests on private property when they're being looted by the million-plus illegals that come across Cochise County in Arizona alone every year.
[01:50:27.998 --> 01:50:30.460]  They're being called vigilantes.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.583]  And then they got this article about how the government's going to use drones on the border.
[01:50:34.890 --> 01:50:36.052]  Let me explain something, folks.
[01:50:36.092 --> 01:50:44.622]  They said, Senator Warner said, head of the Armed Services Committee, he said that they're going to use these drones on our cities, and they are using them.
[01:50:44.682 --> 01:50:47.907]  I have a cousin who's in the Army right here in Austin.
[01:50:47.927 --> 01:50:49.709]  He's an officer at the airport.
[01:50:49.729 --> 01:50:53.674]  They got drones, helicopters, everything, and they are watching you and your family.
[01:50:54.802 --> 01:50:55.924]  So that's your free country.
[01:50:55.944 --> 01:51:01.531]  They admit they got 80-something FBI planes flying around, but nothing's on the border, and it's total garbage.
[01:51:01.551 --> 01:51:10.001]  But then they attack the vigilante group, as they say, for having drones out videotaping the thousands coming across in large bands.
[01:51:11.623 --> 01:51:13.326]  Before I end this hour,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.881]  Here we are again, and I haven't plugged my videos.
[01:51:16.941 --> 01:51:18.922]  Folks, these are really powerful films.
[01:51:19.323 --> 01:51:21.104]  You've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[01:51:21.224 --> 01:51:24.526]  I want to thank the listeners that have gotten the films and supported the broadcast.
[01:51:25.987 --> 01:51:36.273]  If you haven't gotten America Destroyed by Design, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, my new film that's 2 hours and 37 minutes long, incredibly powerful.
[01:51:37.691 --> 01:51:46.955]  If you haven't gotten 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, or Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror, if you haven't gotten my book, Descent into Tyranny, what is stopping you?
[01:51:48.276 --> 01:51:56.600]  It supports the show, they're great films, and I authorize you, I encourage you to make copies of my videos for non-profit, not for sale,
[01:51:57.938 --> 01:51:59.699]  To get them out to educate people.
[01:52:00.139 --> 01:52:08.303]  There's so much power in getting these films, making copies, getting them out to people, they're waking up 90% of those that see them.
[01:52:08.864 --> 01:52:19.069]  This is our classic tactic in the counter-revolution we have against the enemy combatant New World Order usurpers that are overthrowing our constitutional republic.
[01:52:19.711 --> 01:52:31.458]  So go to Infowars.com, go to Infowars.net, get The Road to Tyranny, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, make copies, Wake America Up!
[01:52:31.538 --> 01:52:33.019]  The toll free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:39.938 --> 01:52:44.881]  Operators are standing by at 888-253-3139.
[01:52:45.621 --> 01:52:48.302]  4infowars.com or net.
[01:52:48.402 --> 01:52:49.643]  Don't wait, make the call.
[01:52:49.663 --> 01:52:50.663]  888-253-3139.
[01:52:50.803 --> 01:52:54.245]  We'll be right back with 3rd Hour.
[01:52:55.246 --> 01:52:57.046]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:52:57.207 --> 01:52:57.827]  I mean, real.
[01:52:58.007 --> 01:53:02.869]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:04.050]  Probably never, right?
[01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:06.071]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to...
[01:53:10.026 --> 01:53:13.249]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:21.316 --> 01:53:21.976]  Big Brother.
[01:53:22.637 --> 01:53:23.718]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:24.418 --> 01:53:25.559]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.579 --> 01:53:27.020]  You want answers?
[01:53:27.741 --> 01:53:28.662]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:29.322 --> 01:53:33.126]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:33.486 --> 01:53:37.589]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:49.067]  All right, my friends, already back by the third and final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:53:50.149 --> 01:54:03.422]  I am scheduled to have Robert Fisk of the London Independent talk about what he witnessed while covering the war in Iraq, including the evidence that the looting of Iraq Museum was premeditated and aided by U.S.
[01:54:03.622 --> 01:54:04.003]  efforts
[01:54:05.197 --> 01:54:09.279]  Robert Fisk is Britain's most highly decorated foreign correspondent.
[01:54:09.319 --> 01:54:14.601]  He has received the British International Journalism of the Year award seven times.
[01:54:15.661 --> 01:54:19.563]  And he was in Baghdad and he's coming up about, I'm told, 20 minutes.
[01:54:19.603 --> 01:54:30.667]  But he's in Lebanon, so we'll try to get that connection through and get that interview in the bag, as they say, coming up.
[01:54:31.328 --> 01:54:33.268]  In the meantime, we're going to take your calls.
[01:54:33.348 --> 01:54:34.769]  We've got wide open phones.
[01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:38.670]  And we'll get to your calls after this quick break on any of the issues.
[01:54:38.710 --> 01:54:41.431]  The plunging dollar, Bush says he wants it to plunge.
[01:54:41.471 --> 01:54:42.651]  It's good now, I guess.
[01:54:42.951 --> 01:54:45.311]  We've lost our industry, now our fiat currency.
[01:54:45.732 --> 01:54:49.293]  Oh yeah, when you lose all your jobs, you're going to find out how real good it is.
[01:54:49.333 --> 01:54:53.394]  But that's okay, just wave a plastic, desecrate the American flag, everything will be alright.
[01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:58.935]  As what the flag symbolizes, our liberties, our freedoms are disappearing.
[01:55:00.673 --> 01:55:09.937]  Bush has announced massive gun crackdowns, federal charges for anyone that has a gun that's not supposed to, people that have guns that are going to the shooting range in most states, it's already illegal.
[01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:16.861]  They want to ban all semi-automatic shotguns, and it's just absolutely out of control.
[01:55:16.921 --> 01:55:17.661]  That's coming up.
[01:55:19.105 --> 01:55:22.566]  Terror laws attack civil liberties, a BBC article, that's coming up.
[01:55:23.106 --> 01:55:33.009]  Also, Applied Digital Solutions, the communist Chinese IBM-owned company, says they've got their satellite tracker chip up and working and ready for you and your family.
[01:55:33.029 --> 01:55:33.749]  We'll get to that.
[01:55:34.450 --> 01:55:39.671]  A poll, economy remains top priority, but Bush's people say, no, it's the war on terror.
[01:55:39.791 --> 01:55:43.232]  Ooh, look, there were just bombings in Saudi Arabia, see?
[01:55:43.452 --> 01:55:44.053]  We're right.
[01:55:44.133 --> 01:55:45.093]  Give us all your liberties.
[01:55:46.878 --> 01:55:52.379]  Also, media execs push ownership rule changes so they can have total monopoly.
[01:55:52.439 --> 01:55:54.820]  They're talking about merging the big three networks already.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.241]  They've already merged their news gathering as of three years ago and network news services.
[01:55:59.741 --> 01:56:05.302]  Homeland Security again considers drone patrols has nothing to do with fighting illegals about tracking you.
[01:56:06.422 --> 01:56:10.283]  And News Corp with Rupert Murdoch beats expectations.
[01:56:10.343 --> 01:56:11.063]  Of course it does.
[01:56:12.842 --> 01:56:18.889]  Congress moves to back tactical nuke use against all these foreign enemies that they've armed and built up.
[01:56:19.630 --> 01:56:22.073]  The new $20 bill gets colorful redesign.
[01:56:22.133 --> 01:56:24.916]  It's blue, pink, and green with red.
[01:56:26.963 --> 01:56:29.585]  And this is just the first for the Cashless Society.
[01:56:30.005 --> 01:56:32.127]  The multinational approach to tackle crime.
[01:56:32.167 --> 01:56:32.787]  That's coming up.
[01:56:33.107 --> 01:56:35.349]  Global government merging this system.
[01:56:35.469 --> 01:56:35.649]  U.S.
[01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:38.471]  seeks to end EU biotech moratorium.
[01:56:38.511 --> 01:56:40.232]  They want the biotech engineering.
[01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:43.354]  Also doctored photo from the London Evening Standard.
[01:56:43.775 --> 01:56:44.795]  From the memoryhole.com.
[01:56:46.596 --> 01:56:50.517]  Got a great area in the memory hole showing where they doctor photos for the news.
[01:56:50.977 --> 01:56:54.078]  Already running man-like type propaganda.
[01:56:54.538 --> 01:56:58.840]  Horrible new gun bills being supported by Governor Pataki and the Democrats in New York.
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:02.861]  Gun dealers question impact of bill targeting ammo purchases.
[01:57:03.261 --> 01:57:05.602]  You'll have to register your guns to buy ammo.
[01:57:07.102 --> 01:57:10.243]  Also IMF World Bank joined forces with WTO.
[01:57:10.303 --> 01:57:12.524]  They were all owned and founded by the same groups.
[01:57:12.604 --> 01:57:13.864]  All these global organizations.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.122]  At least 30 dead in Chechnya in suicide bombing.
[01:57:17.562 --> 01:57:19.723]  Neil Bortz says America is a police state.
[01:57:20.484 --> 01:57:21.405]  We'll get to that.
[01:57:22.185 --> 01:57:23.546]  It is all coming up.
[01:57:23.626 --> 01:57:27.309]  Plus the New York Times is losing massive credibility because of their lying reporters.
[01:57:28.449 --> 01:57:35.954]  We will discuss all of it in the next 55 minutes and 20 seconds that we have left.
[01:57:35.994 --> 01:57:39.837]  But first, some of your calls when we return.
[01:57:40.703 --> 01:57:42.083]  What's America going to look like?
[01:57:42.124 --> 01:57:50.766]  What's our economy going to be when we have no manufacturing, we don't have a strong dollar to buy slave goods, when even McDonald's is shutting down a lot of their stores?
[01:57:51.387 --> 01:57:52.187]  What's going to happen?
[01:57:52.227 --> 01:57:53.287]  That's a question for you.
[01:57:53.327 --> 01:57:58.789]  And when are we going to see more terror attacks legitimize the police state here in the United States?
[01:57:59.449 --> 01:58:00.930]  Toll free number to join me, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:09.743]  I'm Alex E. Jones.

[01:58:16.235 --> 01:58:17.817]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:18.197 --> 01:58:23.943]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:24.203 --> 01:58:29.328]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:38.958]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:58:39.298 --> 01:58:44.243]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:58:44.583 --> 01:58:48.607]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:58:48.787 --> 01:58:53.531]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:58:53.932 --> 01:58:59.797]  The Burjee Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:59:06.446 --> 01:59:07.428]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:07.488 --> 01:59:08.689]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:16.858 --> 01:59:24.245]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:24.526 --> 01:59:29.270]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:29.490 --> 01:59:35.136]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:35.356 --> 01:59:39.897]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:40.117 --> 01:59:47.280]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:51.821]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.981 --> 01:59:54.502]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:59:54.722 --> 02:00:01.424]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:00:01.664 --> 02:00:06.933]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:06.953 --> 02:00:07.374]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:15.658 --> 02:00:18.260]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:24.265]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[02:00:24.485 --> 02:00:25.866]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:00:25.967 --> 02:00:29.650]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:35.895]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:00:36.035 --> 02:00:38.517]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[02:00:38.837 --> 02:00:48.460]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:52.981]  It's also very hydrating, and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:00:53.481 --> 02:00:57.142]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[02:00:57.142 --> 02:01:01.685]  Please listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[02:01:01.745 --> 02:01:03.126]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[02:01:03.346 --> 02:01:12.112]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[02:01:12.292 --> 02:01:14.914]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[02:01:15.994 --> 02:01:21.058]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:21.398 --> 02:01:23.699]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:34.652]  It is so incredibly naive of people to say, oh, the government's not corrupt.
[02:01:34.712 --> 02:01:36.073]  They never do anything wrong.
[02:01:36.513 --> 02:01:39.655]  Powerful people don't want more control to run our lives.
[02:01:40.155 --> 02:01:41.396]  How ridiculous!
[02:01:42.316 --> 02:01:45.558]  Oh, you say the government's involved in corruption.
[02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.018]  You prove how they have been involved.
[02:01:47.399 --> 02:01:48.979]  Well, that's just what they do.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:51.681]  They can't help it.
[02:01:52.421 --> 02:01:54.262]  Don't be so extreme.
[02:01:55.752 --> 02:02:09.122]  Over and over and over again we hear this, and then if you actually look at all the crimes of the New World Order, the things they've done, the things they've been involved in, it is mind-blowing, mind-boggling.
[02:02:10.303 --> 02:02:19.970]  And it's a tiny cabal of a few thousand minions, top minions, and think tank experts that write the policy, but the orders come from a handful
[02:02:20.663 --> 02:02:27.590]  A few dozen families that publicly own the world's central banks, the IMF, the World Bank, the whole kit-kat and caboodle.
[02:02:29.171 --> 02:02:30.192]  How do we resist them?
[02:02:30.312 --> 02:02:31.413]  We expose them.
[02:02:31.473 --> 02:02:32.714]  We expose their system.
[02:02:32.735 --> 02:02:34.336]  We expose how ruthless they are.
[02:02:35.037 --> 02:02:42.684]  We educate people that the globalists don't care about the economy, don't care about their lives, that they want to control you, that they want to dumb you down.
[02:02:43.564 --> 02:02:47.548]  Michael in Rhode Island, a WALE 50,000 watt blowtorch listener.
[02:02:48.068 --> 02:02:49.710]  Welcome to the Airwave, sir.
[02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:50.130]  Go ahead.
[02:02:50.150 --> 02:02:51.191]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[02:02:51.331 --> 02:02:51.812]  Good, my friend.
[02:02:51.832 --> 02:02:52.392]  What's on your mind?
[02:02:52.412 --> 02:02:59.079]  I was just, I don't know if you're aware that Larkin Rose's place was just raided last Tuesday?
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:08.788]  For those that don't know, Larkin Rose, yeah, I talked about it Saturday, had a deal exposing the private nature of the IRS and the Federal Reserve.
[02:03:09.814 --> 02:03:18.420]  Also, the IRS fighter, who'd written some good books, has had his book banned by a judge.
[02:03:18.801 --> 02:03:19.301]  Erwin Schiff.
[02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:22.804]  Erwin Schiff, so it's all part of the new freedom, isn't it?
[02:03:23.384 --> 02:03:29.028]  Yeah, I think we're getting to them, because they're starting to go after people illegally now.
[02:03:29.248 --> 02:03:35.653]  Well, you know, when we the people ran four, they plan to run eight, full page, front section,
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.302]  USA Today ads listing U.S.
[02:03:39.362 --> 02:03:52.454]  code with the Federal Reserve's private, the IRS's private collection agency, how the scam works, that the 16th Amendment was never ratified, that got them on the run and they called the USA Today and told them, don't run those ads.
[02:03:52.874 --> 02:03:54.215]  Oh yeah, I'm very familiar with that.
[02:03:54.235 --> 02:03:57.038]  And all the ads did was list the U.S.
[02:03:57.078 --> 02:03:57.458]  code.
[02:03:57.758 --> 02:03:58.439]  Yeah, I know.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.984]  And I was also reading about, well I heard an interview with Peter Kershaw, have you ever heard of him?
[02:04:04.437 --> 02:04:05.077]  Yes, I have.
[02:04:05.438 --> 02:04:06.698]  Have you been on the show yet?
[02:04:07.078 --> 02:04:07.319]  No.
[02:04:07.379 --> 02:04:08.639]  Tell us about Peter Kershaw.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:10.520]  He's a pastor.
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:13.482]  He runs Heal Our Land Ministries out of Missouri.
[02:04:14.382 --> 02:04:16.803]  And he exposes the 501c3 of the church.
[02:04:18.423 --> 02:04:20.885]  You know, that's the funny thing.
[02:04:21.045 --> 02:04:28.692]  The Bill of Rights says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:04:29.112 --> 02:04:31.274]  How, then, are there hundreds of laws on churches?
[02:04:31.774 --> 02:04:34.957]  They tricked them into signing a contract civilly.
[02:04:35.377 --> 02:04:36.518]  That's how they get control.
[02:04:36.558 --> 02:04:44.985]  The government should have nothing to do with churches, but they turned separation of church and state, it was in a letter from Jefferson, around
[02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:49.126]  I mean, government runs churches, not the churches run government.
[02:04:49.446 --> 02:04:50.586]  Yeah, and that's the problem.
[02:04:50.606 --> 02:04:51.626]  They don't want to say anything.
[02:04:53.187 --> 02:04:57.168]  Speak out, what they're supposed to speak out against, because... Number one, churches really can.
[02:04:57.188 --> 02:05:06.370]  They just can't endorse a particular candidate, even under the regulations, but the feds tell them they can't do anything, can't speak about anything, and we all know that's a fraud.
[02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:06.890]  Oh, yeah.
[02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:13.892]  I tried explaining that to my pastor, and he... He's not as educated as far as all this
[02:05:14.571 --> 02:05:15.031]  As I am.
[02:05:15.051 --> 02:05:17.112]  Well, can he read the First Amendment?
[02:05:17.192 --> 02:05:17.893]  Can he do that?
[02:05:18.053 --> 02:05:18.713]  Yeah, he can.
[02:05:18.773 --> 02:05:21.254]  But he says, you know, we incorporate first.
[02:05:21.294 --> 02:05:23.055]  You know, it gives us benefits and stuff.
[02:05:23.155 --> 02:05:24.796]  And I said, I don't think we should be one.
[02:05:24.816 --> 02:05:25.316]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:05:25.336 --> 02:05:26.957]  They sign the contract.
[02:05:27.077 --> 02:05:27.317]  Right.
[02:05:28.678 --> 02:05:29.338]  Very dangerous.
[02:05:30.018 --> 02:05:32.259]  Hey, are folks waking up in your area of Rhode Island?
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:34.400]  Yes, more and more are waking up.
[02:05:34.881 --> 02:05:37.862]  Thanks to your show and to Deadline Live.
[02:05:38.842 --> 02:05:39.863]  It's another good show out here.
[02:05:40.822 --> 02:05:42.044]  That's Mr. Blood.
[02:05:42.145 --> 02:05:43.106]  Mr. Blood, yes.
[02:05:43.447 --> 02:05:51.622]  Yeah, I know that I've been on some of the other fine shows they've got and a 50,000 watt AM covering what, three states?
[02:05:52.347 --> 02:05:53.268]  Oh yeah, I see it happening.
[02:05:53.328 --> 02:05:54.610]  My parents still think I'm crazy, but oh well.
[02:06:12.814 --> 02:06:14.595]  That means I'm on the right side, you know?
[02:06:14.935 --> 02:06:15.576]  Absolutely.
[02:06:15.676 --> 02:06:16.656]  I appreciate the call.
[02:06:16.876 --> 02:06:17.377]  You have a great day.
[02:06:17.637 --> 02:06:18.357]  Good to talk to you.
[02:06:18.417 --> 02:06:19.398]  Mike in New York.
[02:06:19.958 --> 02:06:21.979]  Does anybody care about the dollar plunging?
[02:06:21.999 --> 02:06:23.420]  Do you see what a big deal that is?
[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:24.800]  What'd you call about, Mike?
[02:06:26.081 --> 02:06:27.122]  Chris, go ahead, Chris.
[02:06:27.402 --> 02:06:28.302]  Yeah, how you doing today?
[02:06:28.322 --> 02:06:32.344]  I gotta say, I understand everything you're saying.
[02:06:32.364 --> 02:06:40.569]  A few years ago, I would have thought it was a bunch of bunk until, you know, different traffic stops and different boat stops and crazy things like that where
[02:06:41.598 --> 02:06:46.842]  You know, you're basically told you have no rights, but how do you think you can wake people up?
[02:06:46.882 --> 02:06:48.564]  That's my concern.
[02:06:48.684 --> 02:06:56.190]  It just seems as long as people have, as long as they're working and they got something to eat and they have a house to live in, they really could care less, you know?
[02:06:57.091 --> 02:06:58.312]  Well, that's not really the case.
[02:06:58.372 --> 02:07:06.339]  You know, we all have this attitude, you know, how can somebody know all the baseball and football scores, but they can't tell you what the First Amendment is or the Fourth or the Fifth Amendment?
[02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:08.193]  We've got to relearn that.
[02:07:08.233 --> 02:07:11.636]  You've got to explain to people what the globalists are doing to them.
[02:07:11.676 --> 02:07:22.324]  Give them some medical stuff on aspartame, that it's a deadly wood alcohol put in there to cause medical illness, to make money for the big pharma system.
[02:07:22.785 --> 02:07:28.169]  Show somebody that, or maybe they'll wake up because the environmentalists are trying to regulate the use of their land.
[02:07:28.209 --> 02:07:29.410]  Show them how it's a land rights
[02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:30.310]  Scammer.
[02:07:30.330 --> 02:07:31.331]  Maybe they're a gun owner.
[02:07:31.751 --> 02:07:36.375]  Show them how Bush wants to register all their guns and ban semi-automatic shotguns.
[02:07:36.835 --> 02:07:38.496]  That'll wake them up, get them going.
[02:07:38.976 --> 02:07:41.778]  One of the best tools I've found, Chris, is my videos.
[02:07:41.858 --> 02:07:45.161]  That's why I say you're able to make copies of my films.
[02:07:46.101 --> 02:07:48.223]  If people just get Road to Tyranny.
[02:07:48.263 --> 02:07:49.323]  Frankly, it's our best film.
[02:07:50.344 --> 02:07:51.465]  Police State 3 is excellent.
[02:07:51.485 --> 02:07:52.646]  The others are wonderful as well.
[02:07:53.266 --> 02:07:54.267]  Make copies.
[02:07:54.887 --> 02:07:56.328]  Which I authorize people to do.
[02:07:56.348 --> 02:07:57.289]  I mean, who else does that?
[02:07:58.050 --> 02:07:59.071]  Get them out to people.
[02:07:59.131 --> 02:08:02.253]  We're having a 90% conversion rate.
[02:08:02.314 --> 02:08:03.454]  People are waking up when they see it.
[02:08:03.474 --> 02:08:04.195]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:08:04.876 --> 02:08:06.977]  I do radio interviews almost every day.
[02:08:07.097 --> 02:08:08.779]  If I skip a day, I have two the next day.
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:12.322]  I've done over 800 since 9-1-1.
[02:08:12.422 --> 02:08:15.684]  And about 100 people have called in to disagree.
[02:08:16.225 --> 02:08:19.407]  And I don't know, 3 or 4 or 5 thousand, I haven't counted, have called in to agree.
[02:08:19.447 --> 02:08:22.069]  But I'll be on a show on KOA covering 30 states.
[02:08:24.048 --> 02:08:25.349]  They'll take 30 calls.
[02:08:26.150 --> 02:08:27.711]  One person might disagree.
[02:08:27.731 --> 02:08:33.014]  I've done whole shows on KFI in Los Angeles where one person or no one calls in to disagree.
[02:08:33.575 --> 02:08:46.343]  Liberal shows, conservative shows, when you tell it like it is, when you lay it out, when you're not apologetic about it, when you tell them about history and remind them, the light bulb turns on because people have already heard about all this.
[02:08:46.764 --> 02:08:48.785]  They just never consciously put it all together.
[02:08:49.185 --> 02:08:51.247]  We just bring it into their conscious minds focus.
[02:08:52.601 --> 02:09:00.367]  Also, when I do these radio interviews, routinely people call in and they say, I could be on in San Francisco, New York, I could be on in Miami.
[02:09:00.467 --> 02:09:02.928]  They go, I saw you on AXS TV.
[02:09:03.449 --> 02:09:05.490]  I saw your video here in Houston.
[02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:07.131]  It's incredible!
[02:09:07.552 --> 02:09:09.273]  My neighbor gave me a copy.
[02:09:09.313 --> 02:09:11.895]  I never heard you on the air, but my neighbor gave me a copy.
[02:09:12.195 --> 02:09:14.697]  He's having block parties showing the videos.
[02:09:15.535 --> 02:09:17.196]  Keep doing that, sir.
[02:09:17.696 --> 02:09:18.377]  Give it a shot.
[02:09:18.577 --> 02:09:22.399]  Well, let me tell you, you heard Senator Graham say there's, quote, a cover-up of 9-1-1.
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:22.880]  Right.
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:25.021]  I mean, how, you know, it's getting incredible.
[02:09:25.601 --> 02:09:30.164]  More of us have to stand up until there's millions of targets, then they can't stop us.
[02:09:30.405 --> 02:09:32.986]  Well, it just seems that they could care less at this point, you know.
[02:09:33.026 --> 02:09:38.950]  They're just, they're going to tell you that, yeah, we want everything, and nobody seems to want to do anything as a result of that.
[02:09:39.170 --> 02:09:40.430]  Well, here's my frustration.
[02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:42.431]  You say you heard me a few years ago and thought I was a kook.
[02:09:42.671 --> 02:09:54.414]  Well, no, I heard a lot of conspiracy theory type of things, not you specifically, but people saying, oh, well, you know, the police, you know, they don't have any regard for your rights and such things as that.
[02:09:54.434 --> 02:10:03.156]  I just, I always thought it was bunk until one time I got pulled over for speeding and the cop must have asked me probably 15 times if I had anything illegal in the car.
[02:10:04.025 --> 02:10:10.891]  You know, he was going to search my car, and just on and on and on, and it was at that point I realized, you know, this is serious.
[02:10:11.412 --> 02:10:14.114]  Well, that's when people wake up is when it happens to them, but let me tell you something.
[02:10:15.455 --> 02:10:19.619]  This is so very important, the points you've raised.
[02:10:19.739 --> 02:10:22.362]  That cop's going to wake up when they take his pension fund.
[02:10:23.122 --> 02:10:25.384]  You need to tell him before they take it.
[02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:29.188]  Here's a nine-page printout of Alex Jones
[02:10:29.933 --> 02:10:36.903]  Interviewing Greg Pallas from the BBC, where the BBC reporter says the Rothschilds are trying to stop him.
[02:10:37.283 --> 02:10:41.068]  Their World Bank documents say they're going to devalue the dollar and implode the economy.
[02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:42.671]  That's over a year ago.
[02:10:43.432 --> 02:10:46.456]  So, when they take his pension fund, he knows who did it.
[02:10:47.432 --> 02:10:57.155]  Because the problem is, the globalists will carry out their terror, financial, drugs, crime, terror, everything, different ways of terror, and pose as our saviors.
[02:10:57.555 --> 02:11:01.676]  The number one message is, who are the terrorists?
[02:11:01.756 --> 02:11:04.337]  Because 90% of government's good people.
[02:11:04.677 --> 02:11:09.018]  They're just ignorant, they've been warped into believing this mindset, Chris.
[02:11:10.178 --> 02:11:15.260]  This is how they're doing it, and it's up to you to break your conditioning and to be focused.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.100]  Now, here's the big problem.
[02:11:16.747 --> 02:11:32.351]  The government, with the X-Files and the overnight talk shows, on purpose has put out conspiracy theorists that talk about no moon landing, flying saucers, Martians at the South Pole, Yeti, the Chupacabra,
[02:11:33.730 --> 02:11:39.916]  All of this, and then out of ten guests, they'll have one on that talks about how FEMA, with executive orders, can take all your rights.
[02:11:39.956 --> 02:11:43.299]  Now, we can prove FEMA can take all your rights, put you in forced labor camps.
[02:11:43.659 --> 02:11:45.500]  That's documented public record.
[02:11:46.021 --> 02:11:49.224]  But they mix it in with all this kooky stuff.
[02:11:49.664 --> 02:11:50.445]  Planet X!
[02:11:51.494 --> 02:12:02.357]  Aliens, abductions, they mix it in on purpose, then when the neighbor hears you talk about FEMA, they heard FEMA on the X-Files mixed in with flying saucers.
[02:12:02.677 --> 02:12:07.038]  And the government put out reports in the 60's saying they were going to do that.
[02:12:07.998 --> 02:12:12.219]  To where, if you talk about real stuff, they've mixed it in with garbage.
[02:12:13.959 --> 02:12:15.120]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:16.640]  I mean, everything I, look,
[02:12:17.282 --> 02:12:26.149]  I told people three years ago, I said, the Federal Reserve says they're going to track and trace your money, devalue it if you don't keep it in the bank, they're going to change the color to rainbow and red and all this.
[02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:28.851]  I got calls, you lying nut, where'd you hear that?
[02:12:28.871 --> 02:12:29.752]  I go, Federal Reserve.
[02:12:30.032 --> 02:12:30.732]  Well, where is it?
[02:12:30.812 --> 02:12:32.534]  I can't find it on your site!
[02:12:33.214 --> 02:12:34.916]  And I go, it's on the main page.
[02:12:34.996 --> 02:12:37.838]  Well, it's in all the newspapers, it's coming out right now.
[02:12:38.278 --> 02:12:41.861]  Well, what are the new things they did to the $20 bill that they're not talking about?
[02:12:41.921 --> 02:12:42.882]  Any idea what they're doing?
[02:12:42.902 --> 02:12:43.462]  Well, no, I know!
[02:12:43.502 --> 02:12:45.844]  The Federal Reserve told me three years ago on their website.
[02:12:46.738 --> 02:12:48.138]  All I do is read their own documents.
[02:12:48.778 --> 02:12:50.319]  They said they're going to take everything you've got.
[02:12:50.339 --> 02:12:51.599]  They're going to devalue the money.
[02:12:51.619 --> 02:12:53.139]  They're going to have federal retraining.
[02:12:53.159 --> 02:12:54.600]  They're going to break the families up.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:55.780]  They're going to dumb you down.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.061]  The new economy is going to be surveillance and prisons, my friend.
[02:12:59.081 --> 02:13:00.361]  I know.
[02:13:00.501 --> 02:13:01.061]  I agree with you.
[02:13:01.301 --> 02:13:02.041]  You're absolutely right.
[02:13:02.061 --> 02:13:03.282]  We'll keep trying to do what we can do.
[02:13:03.502 --> 02:13:03.982]  Thank you.
[02:13:04.082 --> 02:13:04.282]  Yeah.
[02:13:04.502 --> 02:13:08.443]  All I do is cover 100% documented information.
[02:13:08.463 --> 02:13:12.604]  And then occasionally I'll speculate and go, hmm, there's been a tragic bombing.
[02:13:12.644 --> 02:13:13.504]  Who stands to gain?
[02:13:13.564 --> 02:13:13.984]  I wonder.
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:20.642]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:13:21.083 --> 02:13:25.625]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:13:26.025 --> 02:13:30.888]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:13:31.248 --> 02:13:33.049]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:13:33.089 --> 02:13:34.110]  can barely be read.
[02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:35.371]  It has faded that much.
[02:13:35.731 --> 02:13:39.593]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[02:13:39.893 --> 02:13:48.258]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[02:13:48.518 --> 02:13:56.383]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95, shipping included.
[02:13:56.683 --> 02:14:00.646]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.

[02:15:24.001 --> 02:15:35.269]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:15:35.489 --> 02:15:38.131]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:42.594]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:15:42.774 --> 02:15:44.915]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:15:45.095 --> 02:15:46.957]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:15:47.157 --> 02:15:53.180]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:15:53.441 --> 02:15:59.104]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:16:04.088 --> 02:16:05.069]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:16:15.729 --> 02:16:16.469]  Are you prepared?
[02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:19.050]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:23.712]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[02:16:24.012 --> 02:16:27.474]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[02:16:27.714 --> 02:16:29.854]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[02:16:30.195 --> 02:16:34.556]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[02:16:34.796 --> 02:16:37.737]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[02:16:37.838 --> 02:16:39.078]  Call the Ark Institute today.
[02:16:39.298 --> 02:16:44.921]  at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[02:16:45.141 --> 02:16:50.463]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[02:16:50.723 --> 02:16:55.725]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[02:16:55.945 --> 02:16:57.046]  Jerry can help here too.
[02:16:57.246 --> 02:17:02.468]  The book, Surviving a Bioterrorist Attack, will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[02:17:02.708 --> 02:17:06.590]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:09.711]  All right, my friends, we do have him joining us from Lebanon over in the Middle East.
[02:17:09.771 --> 02:17:10.692]  He's Robert Fisk.
[02:17:10.712 --> 02:17:12.672]  We already read his bio earlier in the hour for you.
[02:17:34.185 --> 02:17:37.246]  And we've got links to his stories at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:37.266 --> 02:17:38.587]  He writes for the London Independent.
[02:17:38.987 --> 02:17:45.029]  He's here to talk about evidence that the museums were premeditated with our government aiding them.
[02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:52.091]  Also to talk about the real casualties and the cover-ups and the propaganda of these embedded CIA, basically, reporters.
[02:17:52.511 --> 02:17:54.572]  Joining us is Robert Fisk from Lebanon.
[02:17:54.912 --> 02:18:00.234]  Sir, thank you for coming on, and what are some of the key things you saw during Gulf War II?
[02:18:02.162 --> 02:18:11.951]  Well, first of all, I wouldn't say the Americans were involved in the cover-up, and I don't think my colleagues who were, quote, embedded, unquote, and I hate that word with the American military, were CIA agents.
[02:18:12.031 --> 02:18:13.332]  Okay, I was going for one of the Joneses.
[02:18:13.352 --> 02:18:18.036]  I do think the story is a lot more complex than your media have been making it out to be.
[02:18:18.056 --> 02:18:19.658]  Okay, what's really going on?
[02:18:20.078 --> 02:18:26.464]  One of my most abiding memories was walking around the wreckage of the Archaeological Museum in Baghdad.
[02:18:27.435 --> 02:18:46.685]  My feet literally crunching on thousands of years of history as bits of pots simply crumbled away beneath the feet of myself and the guardians of the museum after the wrecking of the, in some cases, 5,000 years of tactile history.
[02:18:46.705 --> 02:18:56.870]  And I have to say that in some circumstances the civilian dead and wounded whom I saw as a result of American firepower
[02:18:57.529 --> 02:19:07.094]  We're ashamed, for example, of what the American government and my own British government said was a war to liberate Iraq.
[02:19:07.615 --> 02:19:10.096]  Having said all that, there are two sides to every story.
[02:19:10.156 --> 02:19:22.003]  At the moment, as we know, thousands of corpses are being dug up in the town of Hilla, which I went to actually under American air attack, but which of course now is free for Iraqis to dig up their dead.
[02:19:22.623 --> 02:19:26.185]  And we are seeing, as we knew we would see, as we knew we would see,
[02:19:26.937 --> 02:19:27.637]  I don't know.
[02:19:43.584 --> 02:19:49.906]  But we must always remember that Saddam's regime was a pretty terrible one, and not just a pretty one, it was a really terrible one.
[02:19:49.946 --> 02:20:03.110]  And I was saying that 20 years ago, when the British government was saying that I was wrong to say it, because in those days, of course, Saddam Hussein's regime was on our side, and we thought that Iraq was a nice country.
[02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:04.791]  That's the point, he was a CIA hitman.
[02:20:06.491 --> 02:20:18.959]  He was a CIA hitman in 58, they supported him in 76, supported him in the 80s, they tried to say that that facility with all the bodies that were in exchange with the Iranians, what do you know about that case?
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:25.983]  Look, there's no doubt that we supported Saddam Hussein, it is factually correct.
[02:20:26.063 --> 02:20:30.186]  Not only did the Germans give him the gas, not only did the biological warfare,
[02:20:30.994 --> 02:20:31.595]  I think?
[02:20:45.595 --> 02:20:54.016]  We know that President Reagan sent an envoy to Baghdad to ask and plead to Saddam Hussein to reopen the American Embassy.
[02:20:54.036 --> 02:20:56.417]  And that envoy, as we know, was Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:20:56.517 --> 02:21:08.659]  We know, too, that the following year he met Tariq Aziz, the number two in the Iraqi regime, on the very day that the United Nations issued its first report about the use of Iraqi gas against the Iranian army.
[02:21:09.419 --> 02:21:13.820]  My own memories of that period are very clear, because when Donald Rumsfeld was in Iraq,
[02:21:16.172 --> 02:21:20.655]  shaking hands with a warm smile with Saddam Hussein.
[02:21:20.675 --> 02:21:31.501]  I was on a military hospital train in Iran, traveling back to Tehran with hundreds of Iranian soldiers who had just been gassed
[02:21:32.254 --> 02:21:35.396]  In the trenches, by Saddam's forces.
[02:21:36.016 --> 02:21:40.999]  They were sitting in their compartments, reading the Quran, coughing mucus and blood into handkerchiefs.
[02:21:41.539 --> 02:21:49.903]  And after several hours, I realized that the terrible smell in the railway compartments was caused by the gas that they were themselves coughing out of their lungs.
[02:21:50.064 --> 02:21:56.627]  I went round the train, opening the windows of the compartments to get the gas out of the carriages.
[02:21:56.827 --> 02:21:58.728]  I, too, did not want to breathe in this gas.
[02:21:59.168 --> 02:22:00.389]  This was at the very moment.
[02:22:01.559 --> 02:22:05.720]  That Donald Rumsfeld was shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:12.762]  So, what I'm saying is, please don't tell me this was about weapons of mass destruction or human rights abuses.
[02:22:12.782 --> 02:22:14.082]  This was not what the war was about.
[02:22:14.782 --> 02:22:16.523]  Well, we know it was about a military base.
[02:22:16.623 --> 02:22:19.303]  The Project for an American Century has said that it was about oil.
[02:22:19.844 --> 02:22:25.525]  How do we have them admitting in their own policies what they were going to do and then later trying to deny it?
[02:22:27.748 --> 02:22:33.054]  Well, this is really a question I think you have to ask American politicians, not British journalists.
[02:22:33.895 --> 02:22:46.388]  You know, the whole issue of the project for the New American Century and those people who were behind it, as we know, came up during the Clinton period.
[02:22:46.708 --> 02:22:50.412]  What is extraordinary is that when the same policy came up,
[02:22:51.067 --> 02:22:55.169]  And was acted upon and was made real in the Bush administration.
[02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:56.169]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:22:56.229 --> 02:22:57.030]  You're a journalist.
[02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:58.290]  Robert Bush, we got a break.
[02:22:58.710 --> 02:23:00.731]  One more segment with you after this quick three-minute break.
[02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:05.513]  And I want to finish up with that and then talk about what you saw in Baghdad, what the conditions are like right now in Iraq.
[02:23:06.694 --> 02:23:07.634]  We're on the march.
[02:23:08.095 --> 02:23:09.715]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.616 --> 02:23:13.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.494 --> 02:23:19.776]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[02:23:20.016 --> 02:23:22.677]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:23:23.378 --> 02:23:28.040]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most dangerous chemicals.
[02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:28.761]  Check 888-803-4438.
[02:23:28.801 --> 02:23:29.641]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:23:29.921 --> 02:23:30.762]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:23:40.956 --> 02:23:41.477]  Don't worry.
[02:23:41.917 --> 02:23:43.458]  This show is documented.
[02:23:43.959 --> 02:23:46.761]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:47.122 --> 02:23:50.605]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:23:50.625 --> 02:23:52.306]  I went down, down, down.
[02:23:52.326 --> 02:23:53.387]  All the flames went higher.
[02:23:53.407 --> 02:23:57.531]  All right, I'm reading a New York Times article carried out of Democracy Now!
[02:23:58.211 --> 02:24:00.233]  Amy Goodman interview with Robert Fisk.
[02:24:01.574 --> 02:24:07.419]  Robert's a very award-winning reporter for London Independent, been in the Middle East for over 20 years.
[02:24:09.365 --> 02:24:13.709]  And on page three, do I have evidence that they knew they were coming for?
[02:24:13.889 --> 02:24:14.169]  Yes.
[02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:17.632]  I do have evidence that this was premeditated.
[02:24:17.732 --> 02:24:18.072]  Yes.
[02:24:18.172 --> 02:24:27.219]  Do I believe that the arsonists were trained and organized from outside who knew whether or not the Americans would be present or whether the American military would defend certain buildings?
[02:24:27.279 --> 02:24:27.600]  Yes.
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:31.743]  The article goes on talking about premeditated looting and stuff.
[02:24:32.458 --> 02:24:35.120]  So, I want to make clear that I was reading this in our news.
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:45.046]  You're saying that... I mean, is there evidence of premeditated looting of structures and buildings and museums, or have you been misquoted in this article, sir?
[02:24:47.787 --> 02:24:53.351]  I didn't really recognize myself in what you were reading, but look, here's the situation, what I wrote about and what actually happened.
[02:24:54.451 --> 02:24:58.614]  Number one, the looting originally was spontaneous.
[02:24:59.034 --> 02:25:00.215]  People came out of a poor
[02:25:01.444 --> 02:25:15.612]  Um, income, low income areas have started looting cars, tires, car doors, computers, telephones, desks, chairs, doors off any government building.
[02:25:15.652 --> 02:25:16.973]  And you could understand why.
[02:25:17.013 --> 02:25:24.237]  And we only have to see the number of graves being dug up now from mass mass graves, dead bodies to see why people would hate the regime.
[02:25:25.290 --> 02:25:42.129]  The key element, however, is that the people who came to burn, in the end, up to 158 government institutions in Baghdad, institutions which are the infrastructure of any new democratic government, destroyed, with their archives, their files, their desks, their computers,
[02:25:42.856 --> 02:25:46.097]  The people who came to Bern were not the same people as the looters.
[02:25:46.117 --> 02:25:55.721]  The looters came along both in terms of the Quranic library, the archaeological museum, the government ministries, to take things which they could sell.
[02:25:57.021 --> 02:26:00.462]  The people who came along to Bern often came in blue and white buses.
[02:26:01.663 --> 02:26:02.743]  I saw one man twice.
[02:26:02.763 --> 02:26:06.624]  He pointed a rifle at me the second time because he recognized that I recognized him.
[02:26:08.205 --> 02:26:09.766]  These people did not come to loot.
[02:26:09.786 --> 02:26:11.006]  They came to Bern to destroy.
[02:26:11.986 --> 02:26:14.628]  In other words, they did not make money by burning.
[02:26:14.688 --> 02:26:17.290]  They obviously have to be paid after the event.
[02:26:17.631 --> 02:26:25.717]  You see the difference between a looter who takes things to sell and a man who comes to burn and has no money to make from the burning.
[02:26:25.917 --> 02:26:36.605]  Well, I read your article on air, I'm going from memory, but didn't you say in the article, because I remember you talking about having the gun pointed at you, in your article weren't there troops basically guarding these buses?
[02:26:38.954 --> 02:26:40.795]  No, there were not troops guarding the buses.
[02:26:41.015 --> 02:26:48.860]  In each case, with the exception of one incident, I never saw American forces next to buildings that were on fire.
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:55.563]  I did ask the question, in the articles that you read, how come these people were setting fire to buildings?
[02:26:55.643 --> 02:27:03.287]  Now, the American version of events was, oh well, maybe Saddam's people paid them in advance to set fire to government buildings.
[02:27:03.728 --> 02:27:04.508]  But this is rubbish.
[02:27:04.568 --> 02:27:07.670]  If you or I pay each other $10,000 to go and burn a building,
[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:10.210]  And then the regime who pays us disappears.
[02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:11.131]  We don't burn the building.
[02:27:11.171 --> 02:27:12.411]  We pocket the money and go home.
[02:27:12.691 --> 02:27:18.712]  Well, the big banks stand... These people are being paid as the arsonist work was going on.
[02:27:18.772 --> 02:27:19.833]  Well, I know this.
[02:27:20.653 --> 02:27:24.433]  Rumsfeld gave a speech where he said, oh, this is what freedom looks like.
[02:27:24.814 --> 02:27:26.794]  People are basically having a little fun.
[02:27:26.814 --> 02:27:28.354]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:27:29.134 --> 02:27:30.675]  This is untidy.
[02:27:30.815 --> 02:27:34.656]  And I remember him saying, how many vases are there?
[02:27:34.816 --> 02:27:36.236]  And actually walking
[02:27:36.952 --> 02:27:42.774]  With my feet over broken vases in the museum, it was shameful to listen to Russia at that point.
[02:27:42.814 --> 02:27:48.696]  Well, he also said that the news was showing one small group of looters, that there really wasn't any widespread looting.
[02:27:49.057 --> 02:27:50.157]  You were in Baghdad.
[02:27:50.297 --> 02:27:51.778]  What is the true magnitude?
[02:27:51.838 --> 02:27:53.058]  The cholera is now there.
[02:27:53.518 --> 02:27:55.899]  What is the true magnitude of the degradation there?
[02:27:56.039 --> 02:28:00.601]  There were thousands of looters and thousands of arsonists.
[02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:27.286]  I remember watching the Quranic library burn with its 15th century illuminated Qurans being destroyed by fire at 3,000 degrees heat and I rushed to the public affairs officer of the US Marines in that area of Baghdad and said there is a Quranic library on fire it's been set on fire four minutes ago I can give you a map reference and show it on my map
[02:28:27.788 --> 02:28:32.030]  And he picked up a telephone and said that some guy here says there's a biblical library on fire.
[02:28:32.050 --> 02:28:34.772]  Well, not quite biblical, Corellink, but he got the right idea.
[02:28:35.452 --> 02:28:38.454]  But I went back to the seat of the fire and nobody came.
[02:28:38.534 --> 02:28:45.818]  There was one incident, some days later, when the Department of Higher Education Computer Programming Department was set on fire.
[02:28:46.562 --> 02:28:47.963]  And I did find a U.S.
[02:28:48.023 --> 02:28:52.968]  Marine sitting on a wall next to the burning building and I came up to him and said, Good morning, Marine.
[02:28:53.348 --> 02:28:56.351]  Fire, fire, fire, pointing at the building next door.
[02:28:56.391 --> 02:28:58.893]  He said, I'm here, sir, to guard the hospital behind me.
[02:28:59.314 --> 02:29:00.915]  We don't know who set fire to this place.
[02:29:00.975 --> 02:29:02.516]  We can't look everywhere at the same time.
[02:29:02.817 --> 02:29:10.584]  This guy, in fact, I called his girlfriend on my satellite phone at his request, but he didn't want to know about the building next door.
[02:29:10.644 --> 02:29:11.745]  So there was a willful
[02:29:12.899 --> 02:29:16.520]  This unwillingness, a willful unwillingness on the part of U.S.
[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:20.762]  forces to deal with this mass sacking and burning in Baghdad.
[02:29:30.387 --> 02:29:35.209]  Trying to understand this, I've seen the photos of Marines cutting gold out of the ceiling.
[02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:47.835]  We know there's been looting, and I don't mean of bayonets, I mean of treasures, pictures of media people running out with things, you know, with baubles, with antiquities.
[02:29:48.855 --> 02:29:53.877]  Did you see any of that, or did you hear from other journalists about that happening in Iraq?
[02:29:55.418 --> 02:29:59.700]  No, I have to be honest and say that all the looting and arson that I saw
[02:30:00.476 --> 02:30:04.958]  Sadly and shamefully, it was as a result of Iraqi people themselves.
[02:30:05.639 --> 02:30:09.200]  Whether they were paid to do it, whether there was a plan, whether there was a conspiracy.
[02:30:09.921 --> 02:30:25.929]  But although I did see Americans deliberately destroying statues of Saddam Hussein, which was hardly a shameful experience of modern art, I didn't see Americans or journalists or Westerners stealing artifacts
[02:30:26.701 --> 02:30:31.443]  Okay, two quick questions.
[02:30:32.003 --> 02:30:33.604]  When were you last in Iraq?
[02:30:33.904 --> 02:30:38.766]  And they've removed this general who said that we should all be so prideful.
[02:30:38.826 --> 02:30:43.168]  They've now got this other envoy in the town of Mosul.
[02:30:43.548 --> 02:30:47.450]  They appointed 250 people to quote, vote for the leaders.
[02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:48.830]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:30:48.890 --> 02:30:51.011]  It's like I appoint people to vote for me.
[02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:53.212]  They now have the big oil companies coming in.
[02:30:53.232 --> 02:30:54.833]  They're talking about a pipeline to Israel.
[02:30:55.393 --> 02:30:59.716]  With the Northern Iraq oil, what is really going on?
[02:30:59.796 --> 02:31:01.777]  What type of government are they really shutting up?
[02:31:01.837 --> 02:31:04.018]  What's happening in Baghdad right now?
[02:31:05.539 --> 02:31:10.682]  I left just over two weeks ago and I'm going back in seven days, six days time.
[02:31:11.162 --> 02:31:20.428]  What is happening is that the Americans are trying to find a way to construct a government which indeed will be friendly to Israel, which will no doubt have an Israeli embassy in Baghdad.
[02:31:21.113 --> 02:31:21.494]  I think?
[02:31:37.052 --> 02:31:39.253]  And what is happening in England?
[02:31:39.333 --> 02:31:42.535]  Is this war still popular?
[02:31:42.555 --> 02:31:49.558]  I mean, I know it was actually unpopular in most of the polls, but then once the war was going, they said it was popular.
[02:31:49.618 --> 02:31:51.640]  What are you hearing from your homeland of England?
[02:32:08.312 --> 02:32:09.013]  Very simple.
[02:32:09.773 --> 02:32:15.917]  Most British people believe they were lied to before the war, lied to during the war, and lied to after the war.
[02:32:16.597 --> 02:32:26.083]  There was the normal patriotic feeling that we've got to stand by our soldiers once they were in combat, once they were in theatre, as the American phrase goes.
[02:32:26.849 --> 02:32:35.478]  But once the war was over, we wanted, I think more than the Americans wanted, to see these weapons of mass destruction for which we'd fought the war.
[02:32:35.938 --> 02:32:38.421]  And the weapons of mass destruction have not been found.
[02:32:38.461 --> 02:32:43.266]  There is growing cynicism again in the United States as to why we went to war.
[02:32:43.626 --> 02:32:45.769]  They've also been caught putting out fake reports.
[02:32:46.609 --> 02:32:48.510]  They claimed Africa sold these nuke parts.
[02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:50.050]  Turned out that was totally made up.
[02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:53.291]  Fake dossiers written by college students.
[02:32:54.892 --> 02:33:01.193]  Can we believe any weapons of mass destruction find in the future when we've been lied to so many times before?
[02:33:01.213 --> 02:33:03.474]  I don't think so.
[02:33:04.654 --> 02:33:11.016]  My concern is that the media, particularly the Americans but also the British, went along with these stories.
[02:33:12.117 --> 02:33:12.997]  I went to the UN
[02:33:13.977 --> 02:33:36.249]  Security Council, when Bush spoke, and I went along to the General Assembly when Bush spoke, I went along to the Security Council when Colin Powell spoke, and I remember seeing his pictures of the famous weapons of mass destruction train, the mobile chemical laboratory, and there were digitalized pictures, artists' impressions from the Defense Department in the United States, of the railway wagons.
[02:33:36.649 --> 02:33:40.491]  Now, the United States now controls the entire railroad system,
[02:33:41.244 --> 02:33:45.448]  of Iraq and they haven't found the mobile chemical weapons trucks.
[02:33:45.608 --> 02:33:50.533]  What do you make of these trucks they found that they're saying are bioweapon labs?
[02:33:51.814 --> 02:33:58.981]  Well they're saying they found two lorries whose purpose they cannot find out unless they were
[02:33:59.847 --> 02:34:03.430]  Um, bioweapons labs, but they haven't found the evidence in the trucks.
[02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:04.931]  Well, they don't have wheels on them.
[02:34:04.951 --> 02:34:08.274]  We're talking about lorries, trucks on the road, for which they were made.
[02:34:08.574 --> 02:34:15.319]  You know, I think that probably Saddam had a few nasty weapons of mass destruction buried in the desert somewhere.
[02:34:15.399 --> 02:34:16.560]  But so does everybody!
[02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:17.621]  Did they get invaded?
[02:34:17.661 --> 02:34:19.222]  And we went to war for this.
[02:34:19.282 --> 02:34:20.423]  We haven't found those trucks.
[02:34:22.683 --> 02:34:24.483]  But, I mean, here's the point I'm trying to make.
[02:34:24.663 --> 02:34:26.284]  Everybody's got these type of weapons.
[02:34:26.304 --> 02:34:27.944]  I mean, hundreds of countries have got stuff.
[02:34:28.224 --> 02:34:29.384]  Are we going to invade all of them?
[02:34:29.404 --> 02:34:36.966]  I'm sure you've heard that Rumsfeld's battle plan got leaked to start bombing North Korea as early as October.
[02:34:37.006 --> 02:34:38.946]  Does that concern you, or what's your take on that?
[02:34:39.266 --> 02:34:46.728]  Well, I think the point is, if we're really worried about weapons of mass destruction, we would have invaded, or you would have invaded, North Korea before Iraq.
[02:34:47.448 --> 02:34:57.776]  If we were worried about human rights abuses, we would have invaded Iraq 20 years ago when Donald Rumsfeld was shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.
[02:34:58.797 --> 02:35:00.478]  I don't believe this is about human rights.
[02:35:00.678 --> 02:35:02.840]  I don't believe this is about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:04.061]  I think this is about oil.
[02:35:04.321 --> 02:35:12.587]  And again, I urge you to go to the documentation of which American companies are going to be permitted to exploit the oil reserves of Iraq.
[02:35:12.647 --> 02:35:13.988]  And that is the story.
[02:35:14.108 --> 02:35:14.749]  Unfortunately,
[02:35:15.482 --> 02:35:19.565]  Your journalists in the United States are, by and large, not telling that story.
[02:35:19.625 --> 02:35:20.946]  Well, no kids!
[02:35:21.326 --> 02:35:30.033]  It's a whole story about the cozying up of journalists and government, of American government departments and U.S.
[02:35:30.133 --> 02:35:30.553]  correspondents.
[02:35:30.573 --> 02:35:32.094]  Well, that's what I said about embedded reporters.
[02:35:32.194 --> 02:35:33.755]  It happens in Britain, but not on this scale.
[02:35:33.956 --> 02:35:35.677]  But that's what I said about embedded reporters.
[02:35:35.697 --> 02:35:39.640]  It's been admitted that some of these guys are, indeed, CIA.
[02:35:41.212 --> 02:35:51.320]  Well, look, I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA and the KGB and every other intelligence organization doesn't have journalists on all sides in wars.
[02:35:51.861 --> 02:36:03.170]  The real problem is not so much whether certain journalists are doubling up as spies, which is a shameful thing for our profession, the real issue is that when you get correspondents
[02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:04.411]  It's a mentality.
[02:36:04.491 --> 02:36:05.051]  It's a mentality.
[02:36:25.501 --> 02:36:28.904]  To enter combat wearing military costume.
[02:36:29.024 --> 02:36:34.309]  In one case, I remember a guy coming with camouflaged boots with leaves painted on the boots.
[02:36:34.329 --> 02:36:36.771]  There aren't an awful lot of trees in the desert, as you're aware.
[02:36:37.112 --> 02:36:40.915]  And the other strange thing was the way in which many of the military people wanted to write.
[02:36:41.275 --> 02:36:46.140]  It always seemed to me that all the soldiers wanted to be journalists and all the journalists wanted to be soldiers.
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:47.781]  But the real problem was not
[02:36:48.662 --> 02:36:52.107]  CIA, MI6, KGB spies.
[02:36:52.508 --> 02:36:59.297]  The problem then, and I think the problem of this war too, was that far too many reporters and journalists and media people
[02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:04.263]  I felt they were taking part in a historical drama, like a television series.
[02:37:04.303 --> 02:37:14.290]  But I'm talking about the reserve for the drama, and then became part of the theater, and forgot that they were writing and broadcasting to people who wanted to hear the truth, not the theater.
[02:37:14.330 --> 02:37:14.930]  Well, you're right.
[02:37:15.210 --> 02:37:18.853]  They were sucked into propaganda, but, and I'll let you go in a second, I appreciate all the time, but...
[02:37:20.409 --> 02:37:33.357]  When I'm talking about spies here, and again we have Robert Fisk, a London Independent, award-winning reporter joining us from Lebanon, he's been in Iraq the last few months, he's going back in six days, is that
[02:37:35.097 --> 02:37:45.469]  The Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence admitted last year that, quote, we're going to lie to you for your own interest, and now we've seen all these fake news reports that have been proven to be lies.
[02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:49.954]  That's what I'm hitting at, and that ties into the Project for a New American Century.
[02:37:50.275 --> 02:37:53.378]  You got cut short in the last segment on that, so that is the last two questions.
[02:37:53.779 --> 02:37:54.660]  What about this
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:58.322]  Well, first of all, when you're in a war, mercifully, you don't have to listen and watch this rubbish.
[02:37:58.342 --> 02:37:59.183]  Unfortunately, I didn't have to.
[02:37:59.203 --> 02:38:01.804]  So, I missed the reports that you're talking about, and I'm happy I did.
[02:38:01.824 --> 02:38:02.605]  I would say
[02:38:24.079 --> 02:38:30.502]  That at the end of the day, the responsibility for accuracy and honesty and integrity lies with the journalist.
[02:38:31.242 --> 02:38:47.449]  All forces fighting war, whether it be the Pentagon, whether it be the British Ministry of Defense, whether it be the Soviet Ministry of War fighting the Nazis in the Second World War, they will all use every means they can to overwhelm their enemies, and that is part of what war is about.
[02:38:47.950 --> 02:38:48.830]  But the journalist
[02:38:49.753 --> 02:38:52.475]  Should have some kind of different morality here.
[02:38:53.396 --> 02:38:54.437]  Many journalists do.
[02:38:55.077 --> 02:39:00.001]  Many of my colleagues refuse to accept the propaganda, the lies and the pressures.
[02:39:00.622 --> 02:39:05.025]  Others do not withstand that and they go along with it because they're
[02:39:05.586 --> 02:39:10.748]  They want to, or because they feel part of the team, or because they become super patriotic when war begins.
[02:39:11.128 --> 02:39:19.630]  You can find in your country plenty of reporters who are perfectly sane until a war starts, after which they become insane in their reporting, and then transmogrify.
[02:39:19.730 --> 02:39:23.931]  Okay, you've been in the Middle East for over 23 years.
[02:39:24.251 --> 02:39:25.472]  What do you see happening?
[02:39:25.532 --> 02:39:26.472]  27 years, to be precise.
[02:39:26.492 --> 02:39:26.692]  27 years.
[02:39:26.712 --> 02:39:27.412]  Okay, this article says 23.
[02:39:30.773 --> 02:39:32.594]  27 years in the Middle East.
[02:39:32.614 --> 02:39:36.475]  I would consider you an expert covering all these wars, the politics, the rest of it.
[02:39:36.895 --> 02:39:39.176]  What do you see happening in five years?
[02:39:39.376 --> 02:39:41.076]  I see our troops still there.
[02:39:41.696 --> 02:39:44.717]  I see this being an outpost to attack all these neighbors.
[02:39:45.117 --> 02:39:50.679]  What do you see the war map, the economic map, for the next five years in the Middle East?
[02:39:51.730 --> 02:39:54.491]  My crystal ball on the Middle East long ago broke.
[02:39:54.672 --> 02:40:02.275]  I think the Americans, if they encounter sufficient opposition, which they will, will be out of Iraq long before five years.
[02:40:02.355 --> 02:40:09.899]  But I think they will have turned, and this is the great danger, the countries of the Middle East into more than symbolic enemies.
[02:40:09.939 --> 02:40:12.100]  They will have turned them into ideological
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.383]  So as Hosni Mubarak said... So Hosni Mubarak was right when he said this is going to create a hundred bin ladens?
[02:40:42.475 --> 02:40:47.178]  Yes, and Mr. Mubarak is most worried of all that one of those bin ladens will shoot him.
[02:40:48.299 --> 02:40:50.780]  Alright, well I appreciate Robert Fisk joining us.
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:59.025]  They can read his columns at the London Independent and at many other papers and at Infowars.com on a regular basis.
[02:40:59.665 --> 02:41:05.389]  I really do appreciate you coming on the show and I hope to have you back up after you go back in to Iraq, sir.
[02:41:06.570 --> 02:41:07.150]  You're welcome.
[02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:08.671]  Take care and be careful.
[02:41:09.975 --> 02:41:10.295]  Thank you.
[02:41:10.315 --> 02:41:10.715]  Good night.
[02:41:11.016 --> 02:41:11.356]  Bye-bye.
[02:41:11.576 --> 02:41:12.196]  All right, folks.
[02:41:12.236 --> 02:41:12.756]  There he goes.
[02:41:12.776 --> 02:41:13.737]  Appreciate him coming on.
[02:41:14.017 --> 02:41:16.338]  And I'm going off the news reports here.
[02:41:16.518 --> 02:41:17.338]  Amazing stuff.
[02:41:17.398 --> 02:41:18.999]  Go to Infowars.com to read them.
[02:41:19.019 --> 02:41:21.220]  I'll come back with some final thoughts and final tidbits.
[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:22.701]  And, yes, I'll plug my videos.
[02:41:23.381 --> 02:41:25.542]  They're great films and it supports the broadcast.
[02:41:25.642 --> 02:41:28.423]  When you get them, grab your pens and paper and get ready for that.
[02:41:29.484 --> 02:41:34.126]  On the other side of this quick break, I do have some other news I'm going to hit on, so please stay with me.
[02:41:37.552 --> 02:41:44.358]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:41:44.698 --> 02:41:46.080]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:48.482]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:41:48.622 --> 02:41:50.724]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:41:51.004 --> 02:41:55.928]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:41:56.248 --> 02:42:00.312]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:42:00.552 --> 02:42:02.314]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:42:02.395 --> 02:42:13.049]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.209 --> 02:42:15.071]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:42:15.452 --> 02:42:19.113]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.

[02:44:38.804 --> 02:44:43.946]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:44.607 --> 02:44:46.948]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:54.151]  Did you hear what Robert Fiss just had to say from one independent?
[02:44:55.692 --> 02:45:00.454]  That they're using terror, they're using it over there for dictatorship, for control.
[02:45:01.155 --> 02:45:03.856]  The globalists are actually helping the Hosni Mubarak's and
[02:45:04.588 --> 02:45:05.549]  Others that are over there.
[02:45:05.649 --> 02:45:08.632]  But in the case of Saudi Arabia, it's a destabilizing effect.
[02:45:09.433 --> 02:45:11.015]  The globals are going to move in and take over.
[02:45:11.055 --> 02:45:13.117]  Bin Laden, as usual, doing a good job for them.
[02:45:13.757 --> 02:45:26.510]  Applied Digital Solutions announces working prototype of subdermal GPS personal location device, specifically designed antenna, and induction-based power recharging method functioned properly in field testing.
[02:45:27.356 --> 02:45:39.750]  Implantable microchips with microscopic wires just like the RFID chips that power off your body for the cell towers and the government wants to put these into you and your family.
[02:45:42.984 --> 02:45:46.285]  Amazing, and now they're consolidating the media at record speed.
[02:45:46.305 --> 02:45:49.067]  Homeland Security to use drones over America.
[02:45:49.087 --> 02:45:51.468]  They first said over our cities for anti-terror.
[02:45:51.488 --> 02:45:56.530]  That didn't sell very well, so they said, okay, 80-plus percent of you think we have too many illegals here at open borders.
[02:45:56.890 --> 02:45:59.551]  We'll put them on the borders and to fight terror.
[02:46:00.111 --> 02:46:03.533]  Well, the drones are already in the sky, and a frightening move.
[02:46:03.593 --> 02:46:08.835]  Congress moves to block Freudian slip, I wish, to back tactical nukes.
[02:46:09.585 --> 02:46:16.011]  Congress moves closer to approving a new generation of small technical nuclear weapons, despite the warnings of arms control experts.
[02:46:16.211 --> 02:46:17.372]  Massive proliferation.
[02:46:18.133 --> 02:46:20.335]  Again, the new redesign of the colored money coming out.
[02:46:20.355 --> 02:46:21.456]  They're going to devalue the currency.
[02:46:21.496 --> 02:46:23.758]  It's already happened, I told you three years ago.
[02:46:24.058 --> 02:46:31.425]  Plus, new colored money, devalue the currency right when that happens, call in the greenbacks, so you cannot physically pay off debts.
[02:46:31.665 --> 02:46:34.928]  Very serious time we are now in, right now.
[02:46:36.048 --> 02:46:38.409]  And just tons of other amazing reports.
[02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:40.090]  We didn't get to.
[02:46:40.570 --> 02:46:46.313]  They're on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:46:46.353 --> 02:46:47.494]  Check both the sites out.
[02:46:47.514 --> 02:46:48.374]  Different webmasters.
[02:46:48.435 --> 02:46:49.435]  Both doing a great job.
[02:46:51.196 --> 02:46:52.297]  On a daily basis.
[02:46:52.497 --> 02:46:54.878]  And of course, get my videos.
[02:46:55.958 --> 02:46:56.959]  I've made eight of them.
[02:46:58.291 --> 02:46:59.132]  Nine of them now.
[02:46:59.232 --> 02:47:00.152]  Police state three.
[02:47:00.333 --> 02:47:02.174]  Total enslavement is now out.
[02:47:02.234 --> 02:47:04.556]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us.
[02:47:05.016 --> 02:47:09.259]  A scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[02:47:09.639 --> 02:47:14.843]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[02:47:15.324 --> 02:47:23.870]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.

[02:47:48.917 --> 02:47:56.824]  Total Information Awareness Network, Patriot Act 1 and 2, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[02:47:57.264 --> 02:48:05.210]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism, and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact, they are the terrorists.
[02:48:05.271 --> 02:48:08.673]  And that's Police State 3, Total Enslavement, 2 hours, 37 minutes.
[02:48:10.663 --> 02:48:13.224]  25.95.
[02:48:10.803 --> 02:48:13.224]  You'll want to watch it in three parts.
[02:48:13.264 --> 02:48:17.426]  It's long, it's jam-packed, it's dynamic, but to absorb it all, watch it in three parts.
[02:48:17.907 --> 02:48:19.647]  I have The Road to Tyranny, over two hours.
[02:48:19.707 --> 02:48:22.409]  Masters of Terror, about 9.11 in the takeover.

[02:49:11.814 --> 02:49:12.374]  The internet,
