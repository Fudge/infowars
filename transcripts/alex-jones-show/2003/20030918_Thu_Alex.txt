[00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:07.056]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.199]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.980]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.801]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.181]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.302]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:30.816]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:38.903]  Hey, you hear that music?
[00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:42.306]  In the background, the Imperial Battle March.
[00:00:43.487 --> 00:00:45.249]  John Ashcroft visited the city.
[00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:53.215]  Protestors had a boombox, started playing the Imperial Battle March and heckling him.
[00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:58.357]  So they're trying to have these staged town hall events, but it's not working.
[00:00:58.377 --> 00:00:59.278]  We'll get into that story.
[00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:04.600]  We'll talk about the hurricane that's now made landfall, though it has slowed down quite a bit, thank God.
[00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:11.663]  And the state of emergency they've got going on in many different areas of the East Coast.
[00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:13.824]  Washington, D.C.
[00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:15.485]  has evacuated.
[00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:33.478]  But in more serious news, there are over 130,000 Chinese troops, special forces type troops, special troops, artillery troops, tank troops, that have been deployed along the border with North Korea.
[00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:39.824]  Japan is threatening to attack North Korea if they put a Taepung Dong-2 on a launch pad.
[00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:40.665]  You can't blame them.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.723]  A couple years ago, North Korea shot a Taepung Dong-2 over Japan and had it crash into the ocean.
[00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:50.844]  India and Pakistan are threatening each other again.
[00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.065]  Lots of different saber-rattling going on.
[00:01:53.466 --> 00:02:00.369]  And our government, those that control this government, helped arm China, helped arm Pakistan, helped arm North Korea.
[00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:09.022]  And now Bush is discussing an embargo, a blockade, if North Korea doesn't take some type of deal.
[00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:16.088]  How do you handle a psychopath, as Paul Watson wrote in Order Out of Chaos, you give him nuclear bombs.
[00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:23.342]  Creating a crisis to offer a World War III super police state solution.
[00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:28.686]  Because if we go into World War III, man, the government's going to say, we're arresting anybody that criticizes our policies.
[00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:30.067]  We're in World War III.
[00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:38.794]  And the thinking process out there will be completely shut off, and we'll be like Germans in Germany, watching our children march off to these foreign fronts.
[00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:40.956]  I mean, you think eight U.S.
[00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:43.358]  soldiers getting killed last night was bad.
[00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:47.701]  Now, going into North Korea will just dwarf that.
[00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:02.038]  Every time they capture a North Korean surveillance boat or army ship, navy ship, about 98% of the time, as they've captured hundreds of them, the people all commit suicide with cyanide pills.
[00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:04.379]  I mean, that's mind control, folks.
[00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:07.605]  That's what they've tried to do with Delta Force.
[00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:09.765]  That's what they've tried to do with the Marines.
[00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:11.425]  That's what they've tried to do with the police.
[00:03:11.986 --> 00:03:12.886]  It hasn't worked.
[00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:14.526]  Americans think too much for themselves.
[00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:16.006]  Not North Korea.
[00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:21.328]  Shaved heads, totally brainwashed, ready to commit suicide instantly.
[00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:31.210]  A force like that's hard to beat, even if you use a bunch of nukes on them, or many nukes as they're calling them, to bunker bust Kim Jong-il's little hideouts.
[00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:38.310]  That's why Kim Jong-il pops up about every three or four months for five minutes for a photo op and disappears.
[00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.352]  Dick Cheney's been creeping around.
[00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:43.854]  He'll pop up on Meet the Press about once a month.
[00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:44.875]  I'm still here.
[00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:46.336]  Go back underground.
[00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:50.880]  He's right outside Philadelphia, the news has reported, in a giant underground bunker.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.961]  A man bunker.
[00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:55.764]  But the government's telling you, hey, that's not the threat.
[00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:06.081]  According to Bush and Ashcroft's new announcement of a terrorist watch list, it is homeschoolers, gun owners, Christians, anybody who's anti-abortion.
[00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.482]  That's ABC News, folks.
[00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:10.543]  That's New York Times.
[00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:11.803]  They're telling us how good it is.
[00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.205]  It mainly watches the domestic people who might be terrorists.
[00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:16.765]  The border's wide open.
[00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:21.307]  They're handing out uranium and reactors and missile parts like hotcakes.
[00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:29.373]  They're arming all of our enemies, got our troops spread out over 140 countries and in dozens of other sub-regions.
[00:04:31.414 --> 00:04:38.797]  On average, about 12 American soldiers are dying every day worldwide from accidents in foreign lands, or being shot, or stepping on landmines.
[00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:41.919]  But that's okay!
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.163]  Because they're gonna pull you over, or you and your wife, and jerk you out of your car in downtown Ohio.
[00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:51.144]  Or in central Texas.
[00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.213]  Don't worry, everything you're doing is being watched.
[00:04:56.136 --> 00:05:01.321]  You see, out of this crisis, this global technocracy gets more power.
[00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:06.467]  And they'll sacrifice our civilization to maintain and expand that power.
[00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:07.468]  We'll be back!
[00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:14.423]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:19.028]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:23.594]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:24.936]  The New World Order.
[00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:26.036]  Panama.
[00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:27.518]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:41.058 --> 00:05:41.498]  We're good to go.
[00:06:09.478 --> 00:06:14.121]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:20.244]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:23.286]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:30.790]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:39.482]  The Social Security Number Not Required Policy Manual from Nonumber.com tells you how to assert your rights and live free as an unenumerated American.

[00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:12.502]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:07:12.642 --> 00:07:16.864]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:20.005]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:22.606]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:07:22.806 --> 00:07:31.530]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.110]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.692]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:38.292]  I think?
[00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:00.484]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:02.066]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:38.662]  Let me, without a bunch of hyperbole or my normal histrionics, boil down what we're facing on a geopolitical snapshot, thumbnail sketch.
[00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:43.866]  America is controlled by old money out of Europe.
[00:08:44.826 --> 00:08:52.172]  The classical names, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, you know them as the House of Windsor, the Dutch Royal Family, the Rothschilds,
[00:08:53.190 --> 00:09:02.317]  In this country, the Rockefellers in a transnational situation, the Oppenheimers that control the world, Diamond Monopoly.
[00:09:02.337 --> 00:09:07.020]  I mean, these people really do own the private central banks.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.622]  They really own the money machines that print the money.
[00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:13.765]  So it's not about making money to them, they literally make it.
[00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:16.476]  They don't physically make it.
[00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.117]  They are about control.
[00:09:18.297 --> 00:09:19.997]  And they don't care about your standard of living.
[00:09:20.037 --> 00:09:29.578]  In fact, they want to dumb you down and give you gladiatorial diversions and all the rest of the trash that's on television so that you can be absolutely, totally enslaved.
[00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:32.399]  They own America.
[00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:35.159]  They own our private Federal Reserve.
[00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:43.961]  They control the key people in academia and banking and the media and in the executive and the legislative and the judicial.
[00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:51.549]  All of the key personnel in the Western world are CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group members.
[00:09:51.929 --> 00:10:06.174]  You cannot hold a high position as a gatekeeper in a key area of infrastructure unless you are a member of the House, the Senate, or one of the upper-level advisory roundtable chambers of true government.
[00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:08.515]  That's what these institutions are.
[00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:35.901]  They then come in and control our Congress, our Supreme Court, our other federal courts, our legislative bodies at the state levels by having key governors in the Governor's Conference, key leaders in states, National Association of County Chairmen, National Association of City Chairmen, of water districts, all of them coming together, a few thousand people, combining their strength to build up their own wealth and power and control.
[00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:39.422]  And that's how this crime syndicate works.
[00:10:41.202 --> 00:10:54.407]  Now, they can't have world government right out in the open, tyrannically going in and blowing countries to pieces and smashing their infrastructures and then bringing in the IMF and World Bank and setting up their private central banks there.
[00:10:56.807 --> 00:10:58.568]  They can't do that!
[00:11:01.049 --> 00:11:01.669]  They can't
[00:11:02.356 --> 00:11:09.839]  Get away with that if it's just one big global government and, hey, we're doing this because we want power and control because we're despots.
[00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:24.484]  They need to have a propaganda envelope around it of, oh, it's to feed the poor, oh, it's to vaccinate the children, oh, it's to stop these terrorists, oh, it's to bring democracy to the region.
[00:11:24.964 --> 00:11:29.066]  And they take over countries that are run by good people, they take over countries that are run by bad people.
[00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:33.407]  Generally, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:11:33.847 --> 00:11:38.490]  And so they're normally knocking off lower-level scum that wasn't part of their crime ring.
[00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:49.336]  So that, you know, it's easy for the globalist at one level to say, oh, we're taking over all these countries because, oh, look, this guy dresses up in a military outfit and he's a thug and, you know, he tortures and kills people, so we're going to knock him over.
[00:11:49.356 --> 00:11:57.261]  And then, oh, well, see, the global government must be good because it's knocking off Saddam or it's knocking off this person or that person.
[00:11:58.607 --> 00:12:14.535]  When in truth, in almost every case, that dictator, that scum, that thug is somebody put into power decades ago by the globalists, in fact in every case, to take out the elected government, or the peaceful government, or the good government that was in charge before.
[00:12:15.498 --> 00:12:34.234]  So they put in a dictator, have a coup d'etat, put in their dictator, and then later remove that dictator, have a big war, have a bunch of weapons sales, go in and blow up the infrastructure of the country so the IMF and World Bank can come in and take over and totally enslave the population and begin the public schooling, the inoculations, the poisoning of the water supplies,
[00:12:34.774 --> 00:12:36.235]  So this is what they do.
[00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:37.696]  This is how they run the New World Order.
[00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:46.243]  So they can't just come in and say, we're going to smash and kill everybody because we're evil and we want power, like every other dictatorship in history.
[00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:09.697]  No, they say, well these are evil terrorists, and we've been attacked by them, and so to have those terrorist attacks, this criminal system carries out attacks as a pretext to bring in more control.
[00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:12.118]  And that's the key area that we talk about on this show.
[00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:15.160]  One of the main areas of focus.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.622]  And to do that, they've got to have America take the blame.
[00:13:19.762 --> 00:13:23.043]  Now in the last century, this big global government
[00:13:24.498 --> 00:13:37.206]  Needed to gobble up other sovereign empires or other oligarchies or other crime syndicates or other elected governments, whatever stripe they may be, they weren't under that umbrella of the Pax Global Empire.
[00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:39.667]  They were rivals.
[00:13:40.728 --> 00:13:42.849]  And so the globalists created the Soviets.
[00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:46.291]  They publicly funded them, gave them the weapons, gave them the tools.
[00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:49.273]  They publicly funded Hitler, built him up.
[00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:52.755]  Again, building up these giant
[00:13:53.965 --> 00:14:09.736]  Leviathans to go out and knock down borders and crush existing power structures so that the New World Order crowd could then play the part of the good guys and build up their own armies to counter their own creations.
[00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:21.965]  And so now, compared to 100 years ago, 200 million plus dead later, you see the world in these large blocks.
[00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:37.120]  You've got Latin America in a big block, North America in a block, Middle East in a block, Europe in a block, Russia just as a giant criminal feeding ground where the natural resources are being extracted and people are getting none of it.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:44.882]  Japan controlled by the globalists, being held, blackmailed by North Korea that was armed by the globalists.
[00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:49.704]  China, holding the region under blackmail for the globalists, has been armed by the globalists.
[00:14:51.343 --> 00:14:53.408]  And so they created this elaborate system.
[00:14:54.911 --> 00:14:55.532]  And it's a fact.
[00:14:55.572 --> 00:14:56.955]  They have armed all these enemies.
[00:14:56.975 --> 00:14:58.418]  They have built up all these enemies.
[00:14:58.578 --> 00:14:58.739]  But...
[00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:21.557]  The new world order, the EU where it's based, needs to play the part of the arbiter of peace and love and goodness and to get everybody to sign on and relinquish their liberties and national sovereignties to the IMF, World Bank, OECD, World Health Organization, UN, World Trade Organization, which are all chaired by a handful of the same people that are members of these globalist organizations.
[00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:44.833]  So they come out against the Iraq War, say how bad it is, decry it, when they told Iraq, you accept occupation by our troops, you let us control all your oil, that's your good cop choice, or we send in troops to smash and destroy everything, and enslave your people, we'll let the bad cop America come get you.
[00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:48.036]  Simultaneously,
[00:15:49.085 --> 00:16:09.920]  The so-called bad cop America is controlled by Europe and is playing the part as a pawn, yes, a pawn, a set piece to publicly attack that region, get all the Arabs up in a big uproar, get them focused on America and England as the enemy.
[00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:21.315]  I mean, look at the UN saying they are against Israel, they don't like Israel existing, they support the Arabs and the Palestinians, and the Arabs actually buy into that.
[00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:23.097]  Totally controlled.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.201]  It's amazing.
[00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.886]  I mean, look at who runs Europe.
[00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:32.668]  Look at who's running the UN.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:43.182]  I mean, it's a collection of Nazis and a collection of Zionists, all these people, and they're running around saying, oh, we don't support Israel, when it was that same crowd that helped create Israel.
[00:16:44.242 --> 00:16:45.042]  Very bizarre.
[00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:59.425]  So all the names and the faces and the things you've seen attached to different movements, generally it's about 180 different from what the facade is, what the surface is.
[00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:17.292]  And so now America is going to be used internationally as the new attack dog, the new Soviet Union, the new wind-up toy by Europe that publicly owns our Federal Reserve and our major corporations and controls our Congress and our President and our courts and our media.
[00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:18.252]  Owns it outright.
[00:17:20.053 --> 00:17:26.876]  They're going to use America to go in and smash and kill and murder women and children and steal oil,
[00:17:28.408 --> 00:17:37.092]  And all those documents are coming out, and all those lies that were told on purpose to be caught in those lies are all coming out, and Europe and the world is all seeing it.
[00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:42.794]  But here's the trick of the magician at the New World Order level.
[00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:52.238]  Domestically, we're being fed propaganda that, oh, it's all good, and we're holy, and we're loving, and we're right, and the liberals are trying to stop it, and the U.N.'
[00:17:52.218 --> 00:17:55.579]  's bad, and we're on this big crusade under Bush, the conservative.
[00:17:59.256 --> 00:18:01.838]  See, domestically, we're all feeling good about this.
[00:18:02.278 --> 00:18:11.044]  But internationally, we're being demonized and see the EU and the UN as being legitimized and being built up as the good guys, you understand.
[00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:13.306]  So it's all good cop, bad cop.
[00:18:16.008 --> 00:18:22.152]  And America's being shut up for a fall with North Korea, China, Pakistan, Russia.
[00:18:23.173 --> 00:18:28.637]  I mean, China's massing troops just like they did back in the 1950s on the border with North Korea.
[00:18:29.617 --> 00:18:31.799]  Japan is now admitting they have nuclear weapons.
[00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:33.840]  Again, it should be a top news story.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.161]  They've been reporting it for six months.
[00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:37.682]  They've got them and they're threatening to nuke North Korea.
[00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:49.130]  If North Korea puts a missile on the launch pad, suddenly the Japanese are talking about war, launching ships, aircraft that they've been busily building and keeping undercover, which the globalists had full knowledge of.
[00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:54.934]  Europe has built up a giant military while we were all sitting around watching football games.
[00:18:57.988 --> 00:19:04.673]  And our government has armed North Korea and China, and now North Korea can hit any city in the U.S., not just the West Coast.
[00:19:04.733 --> 00:19:06.314]  As I told you years ago, they now admit it.
[00:19:07.175 --> 00:19:11.718]  Kim Jong-il, a hereditary dictator, is running around in a psychopathic fashion, threatening everyone.
[00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.420]  The world's being told that Bush is an hereditary dictator.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.561]  That was all done on purpose.
[00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:17.362]  Same thing.
[00:19:17.382 --> 00:19:18.462]  The world's seeing that.
[00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:20.684]  Kim Jong-il, too, over here.
[00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:43.941]  And we're being set up for a fall with Europe and the EU to come out of it unscathed as the saviors, as the good guys, with their new aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons and stealth bombers and space planes, which they admit they've got now, which have been transferred by our government to them, to their bosses, to their militaries.
[00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:46.862]  The space-based weapons platforms, all of it.
[00:19:48.363 --> 00:19:53.208]  Your kids are going to play the part of bad guys in World War III.
[00:19:53.468 --> 00:19:54.949]  And they're going to lose!
[00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.752]  And then Europe's going to rise out of that.
[00:19:59.053 --> 00:20:03.997]  And we're going to be nothing but a broken up third world country with Mexico running the southwest.
[00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:08.321]  Now that's what's going to happen unless we turn things around.
[00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.525]  Been thinking about your health lately?
[00:20:13.357 --> 00:20:15.237]  Of course you have, because it matters to you.
[00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:18.858]  Unfortunately, the more you look, the more confused you get, right?
[00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:24.359]  Sifting through products, seeing through the hype, and making sense of all the claims seems impossible.

[00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:30.517]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:30.737 --> 00:21:33.397]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:33.737 --> 00:21:37.818]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:40.199]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:40.339 --> 00:21:42.221]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:42.421 --> 00:21:48.444]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.

[00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:00.056]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:14.242]  Hi, this is Jack Browning with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.

[00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.914]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[00:22:28.114 --> 00:22:29.375]  This is more than a handbook.
[00:22:29.575 --> 00:22:32.898]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[00:22:33.278 --> 00:22:33.978]  Here's the deal.

[00:22:45.704 --> 00:22:51.987]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918, and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:57.913]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.

[00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:34.130]  Coming up in the next segment, toll free number to join us on air 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:41.091]  What do you think about the North Korea, China, Pakistan, India situation?
[00:24:41.611 --> 00:24:43.132]  China's saying they're going to be going into
[00:24:44.378 --> 00:24:45.678]  Taiwan here pretty soon.
[00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:47.919]  And why would our government arm all these enemies?
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.421]  Also, we'll get into Saudis consider nuclear bomb.
[00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:54.702]  I saw the one in Guardian.
[00:24:54.742 --> 00:24:55.122]  D.C.
[00:24:55.162 --> 00:24:56.602]  shuts down ahead of Hurricane Isabel.
[00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:57.222]  It's now hit.
[00:24:57.863 --> 00:24:58.183]  Eight U.S.
[00:24:58.263 --> 00:24:59.983]  soldiers killed in Iraq ambush.
[00:25:00.784 --> 00:25:01.864]  Hey, bring them on, they say.
[00:25:03.165 --> 00:25:07.106]  Front man for hell on earth takes his case to Bay Area Airwaves.
[00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:11.518]  This shows what assisted suicide is all about.
[00:25:11.558 --> 00:25:13.739]  A satanic ban of pure trash.
[00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.420]  Probably loving death.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.160]  Culture of death.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.820]  We'll get into that.
[00:25:18.301 --> 00:25:24.745]  Also, West Nile, folks, they're saying there could be 35,000 people statewide in Colorado with it.
[00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:26.746]  That's how the Rocky Mountain News.
[00:25:28.147 --> 00:25:32.029]  I mean, that's really a scary number.
[00:25:33.109 --> 00:25:36.111]  So we'll be getting to that as well here on the show.
[00:25:37.992 --> 00:25:42.376]  This is from the Daily Trojan University Wire newspaper.
[00:25:42.636 --> 00:25:44.777]  Ashcroft booed at meeting.
[00:25:45.838 --> 00:25:52.523]  Imperial Death March accompanies Ashcroft in the Boston meeting.
[00:25:53.384 --> 00:25:54.185]  This is what he heard.
[00:25:54.921 --> 00:26:13.955]  With fist and middle fingers up raised, a booing, hissing, and chanting crowd of about 1,200 people awaited United States Attorney General John Ashcroft when he arrived at the hall at Boston University Tuesday morning decrying his support of what some protesters call government policies undermining civil rights.
[00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:24.808]  Ashcroft was bombarded by cries of shame and the sound of Imperial Death March from the movie Star Wars as he entered a meeting with law enforcement officials in the hall.
[00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.891]  Now understand, these are stage meetings.
[00:26:28.992 --> 00:26:30.073]  Citizens aren't allowed in.
[00:26:30.454 --> 00:26:31.515]  Students aren't allowed in.
[00:26:32.235 --> 00:26:35.839]  Generally, they'll give out about 180 control tickets to police.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.201]  Media is screened.
[00:26:38.281 --> 00:26:40.463]  I mean, major newspaper reporters aren't allowed in.
[00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:42.651]  They do a background check.
[00:26:43.071 --> 00:26:47.936]  It was submitted about a day before when they announced he's coming, and if you've written any critical articles, you don't get let in.
[00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:50.499]  I mean, that's not a free country, folks.
[00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:55.544]  But I have articles right now in front of me where they're billing these, quote, as debates.
[00:26:56.345 --> 00:26:58.688]  Ashcroft defending his ideas, and I pointed out that
[00:26:59.332 --> 00:27:02.653]  In his Arizona meeting, they're not allowing anyone in.
[00:27:02.693 --> 00:27:06.294]  They're allowing 200 tickets to be specifically given out to people in government.
[00:27:06.314 --> 00:27:06.854]  That's admitted.
[00:27:07.234 --> 00:27:08.474]  And they called that a debate.
[00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:10.675]  We complained about it in the Arizona Republic.
[00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:13.196]  Then wrote another article going, okay, it's not really a debate.
[00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:14.876]  And people point this out.
[00:27:16.116 --> 00:27:21.098]  See, we have to hold them on these outright lies and crafting that's going on out there.
[00:27:21.358 --> 00:27:23.058]  They mislabel everything.
[00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:25.579]  But can you imagine
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.641]  Can you imagine Ashcroft marching in?
[00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:29.702]  Hit it again, Mark.
[00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:32.984]  Can you imagine Ashcroft marching in and hearing this?
[00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:46.972]  As the young people are outside of the meeting, playing this, blaring it at him, as he marches in.
[00:27:47.961 --> 00:27:51.342]  They need to know that we know that they're trying to destroy our freedoms.
[00:27:51.762 --> 00:27:53.202]  This has nothing to do with terror.
[00:27:53.502 --> 00:27:56.203]  In fact, this is being pushed by those that are the terrorists.
[00:27:57.223 --> 00:28:00.624]  And I would also add the caveat to this that these young people need to know.
[00:28:00.644 --> 00:28:08.706]  They don't care if you protest now because the globalists are going to carry out more terror and say, see, people like you kept us from keeping you safe.
[00:28:09.226 --> 00:28:09.666]  Shut up!
[00:28:09.747 --> 00:28:11.167]  No more protesting allowed!
[00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:13.227]  They're actually discussing that.
[00:28:13.728 --> 00:28:15.568]  So you need to add at these protests
[00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:18.756]  I know a lot of protesters have been doing this.
[00:28:19.857 --> 00:28:30.182]  That quote, Bush did it, Bush knew, Reichstag, 1933, September 11th, 2001 with a picture of Hitler and Bush.
[00:28:30.282 --> 00:28:34.804]  We gotta get that message out to people now.
[00:28:35.124 --> 00:28:40.747]  That's the message, not that, oh, you're taking our liberties and freedoms and using this as an excuse.
[00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:44.486]  No, we need to talk about all the evidence of prior knowledge.
[00:28:45.046 --> 00:28:46.707]  All the evidence of government involvement.
[00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:50.148]  No one has greater connections to Al-Qaeda than the CIA!
[00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:51.548]  They're the mommy of it!
[00:28:51.588 --> 00:28:52.688]  They gave birth to it!
[00:28:53.969 --> 00:28:56.810]  The Senate reports in 1999, folks, they were still funding them.
[00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.430]  This stuff is coming out.
[00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.531]  So we gotta get that news out to people.
[00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:08.113]  And yesterday I didn't really do a good job of this, because I've already covered it so much, but it really now is breaking finally.
[00:29:09.525 --> 00:29:23.490]  That Ashcroft has lied about Patriot Act 2, that Patriot Act 1 does affect all citizens and all crimes, it's going to be used in misdemeanors, and finally the Associated Press, finally ABC News and others are reporting it, but they say, oh well, what's the big deal?
[00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:29.773]  They don't call him a liar, they just say, well that's not the case, what Mr. Ashcroft has been saying, and well maybe it is needed.
[00:29:31.493 --> 00:29:35.275]  And I've been really decrying Threat Matrix, it's getting massive promotion.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.244]  The new ABC show where we're torturing people is good, and evil is good, and Joseph Mingle is basically good.
[00:29:42.745 --> 00:29:46.088]  Big editorial of someone that's seen an episode of it and reviewed it.
[00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:48.390]  It's supposed to air tonight, isn't it?
[00:29:49.791 --> 00:29:53.414]  But one of these reporters has seen it, and it says it's pure police state promotion.
[00:29:53.454 --> 00:29:54.795]  This is a major newspaper saying this.
[00:29:55.276 --> 00:29:57.077]  I'm glad you have eyeballs and ears.
[00:29:57.398 --> 00:29:58.158]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.461]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.941 --> 00:30:03.463]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:07.219]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.762]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:30:15.902 --> 00:30:21.623]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the at-least-gram.
[00:30:21.703 --> 00:30:22.644]  Viagra and many more.
[00:30:22.884 --> 00:30:24.364]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:30:24.384 --> 00:30:25.384]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:30:44.907 --> 00:30:47.629]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones back live.
[00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:56.494]  And it's already Thursday, the 18th of September, 2003.
[00:30:56.634 --> 00:31:01.237]  The total free number to join us on air, and your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:01.257 --> 00:31:01.697]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:01.717 --> 00:31:04.499]  Our websites are infowares.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:17.260]  Coming up, Saudi's considered nuclear bomb.
[00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:24.863]  North Korea is accusing Japan of aggression because Japan says they're going to attack North Korea.
[00:31:24.924 --> 00:31:30.106]  North Korea puts one of their Taepung Dong-2, now long-range missiles, on the pad.
[00:31:31.686 --> 00:31:34.728]  We just have huge escalations going on all over the place.
[00:31:34.968 --> 00:31:35.368]  Eight U.S.
[00:31:35.408 --> 00:31:36.449]  soldiers killed in Iraq.
[00:31:36.709 --> 00:31:37.169]  Ambush.
[00:31:38.357 --> 00:31:55.376]  Today they're scheduled in Tampa at some satanic rock concert to have somebody commit suicide, and you ought to see the scum in their stupid little sissy outfits that are part of this lesser demon rock band.
[00:31:56.377 --> 00:31:58.660]  And how, again, it's a celebration of death.
[00:32:00.031 --> 00:32:01.832]  It's an outright celebration of death.
[00:32:01.892 --> 00:32:07.256]  It's like that Rolling Stone article where a third of the men in San Francisco who are homosexuals want AIDS.
[00:32:07.657 --> 00:32:08.517]  Want to die.
[00:32:08.577 --> 00:32:10.979]  Now the BBC reports it's the same in London.
[00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:15.402]  I mean, you study this stuff and it's all death, death, death.
[00:32:15.442 --> 00:32:16.383]  Destroy your body.
[00:32:16.463 --> 00:32:17.284]  Death, death, death.
[00:32:17.384 --> 00:32:18.164]  Oh, it's good.
[00:32:18.565 --> 00:32:19.785]  You're just backwards.
[00:32:20.106 --> 00:32:21.567]  We mutilate our bodies.
[00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:22.167]  It's good.
[00:32:22.187 --> 00:32:25.350]  Yeah, we saw that going on in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.512]  This is just the culture of death being sold to you by the New World Order, folks.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.663]  Well don't worry, the New World Order killed 200 million people last century.
[00:32:32.683 --> 00:32:38.629]  They're going to make that look like a drop in the bucket, the tip of the iceberg this century, unless we stop them.
[00:32:38.889 --> 00:32:41.391]  So you trash out there, you'll get all the death you ever wanted.
[00:32:41.612 --> 00:32:46.196]  And believe me, you're the first people on the New World Order's list, because you already belong to them.
[00:32:46.216 --> 00:32:50.019]  And history shows, this system eats their own first!
[00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:53.523]  So I want to warn you of that, you trash!
[00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:57.976]  I'll get to that.
[00:32:57.996 --> 00:33:00.097]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:01.138 --> 00:33:10.121]  Before I go any further, I want to promote this because I have one in my home and it's an amazing unit.
[00:33:12.442 --> 00:33:15.323]  Folks, they haven't had a sale like this in about six months.
[00:33:15.623 --> 00:33:18.284]  Last time they did the sale was over six months ago.
[00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:21.346]  They have on sale the SS1 Aeronizer.
[00:33:22.186 --> 00:33:26.748]  This company has been around, the company that makes these, since
[00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:31.536]  The 1950s, they were the big inventors of the ozone generators.
[00:33:32.016 --> 00:33:32.937]  They sell to the U.S.
[00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:33.337]  government.
[00:33:33.357 --> 00:33:34.698]  They sell to the big hotel chains.
[00:33:34.718 --> 00:33:37.419]  I mean, this is a big factory, a big outfit.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.261]  And the distributor here, this is the lowest price you'll find anywhere.
[00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:42.422]  Go ahead and try to find it lower.
[00:33:43.062 --> 00:33:44.663]  They have the SS1 Aeronizer.
[00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:49.706]  It just, it puts out higher level molecules of oxygen.
[00:33:50.106 --> 00:33:52.407]  And I'm sure you've heard germs die in oxygen.
[00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:53.248]  They die out in the open.
[00:33:53.268 --> 00:33:53.648]  Well, this is
[00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:56.031]  This is high-powered oxygen.
[00:33:56.051 --> 00:33:59.854]  This is big clumps, big molecules of it that take a long time to break down.
[00:33:59.914 --> 00:34:04.618]  It doesn't have any of the toxic stuff that could be associated with some of the ozone generators.
[00:34:04.638 --> 00:34:06.320]  This is the next generation.
[00:34:08.381 --> 00:34:10.043]  It's an air purifier, an air cleaner.
[00:34:10.824 --> 00:34:13.186]  And it puts out oxygen.
[00:34:13.206 --> 00:34:14.146]  You don't have to clean it.
[00:34:14.407 --> 00:34:16.428]  It just puts out oxygen.
[00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:18.250]  Higher levels of oxygen.
[00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.332]  And with these sealed houses today,
[00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:30.328]  That's why you got all this weird mold growing and all these weird allergies because the houses, the new houses built in the last 20 years are so sealed and people don't ever open their windows.
[00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:33.591]  And so there's all this horrible stuff growing in your house.
[00:34:33.611 --> 00:34:39.035]  Well, oxygen just annihilates the bad bacteria, the bad stuff in your home.
[00:34:39.816 --> 00:34:41.497]  And I have one of these.
[00:34:41.557 --> 00:34:42.398]  It's amazing.
[00:34:43.058 --> 00:34:44.780]  Folks, you need to have one.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.582]  And they have their smallest unit
[00:34:48.533 --> 00:34:51.315]  Well, they're next to smallest unit for only $160, normally $200.
[00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:53.957]  You won't find it any lower price, folks.
[00:34:54.457 --> 00:34:55.618]  And it just pumps out.
[00:34:55.898 --> 00:34:56.679]  You can smell it.
[00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:01.943]  It smells like, you know, after a rain, you know, that good smell you smell, that clean smell.
[00:35:02.363 --> 00:35:04.164]  It just shoots that stuff out, folks.
[00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:07.827]  You put it up high on a bookshelf or something, it just pours down.
[00:35:07.847 --> 00:35:15.892]  And I've seen people around these that smoke, and when cigarette smoke gets near it, it just dissipates.
[00:35:15.953 --> 00:35:16.493]  It's amazing.
[00:35:17.947 --> 00:35:22.492]  This is an old established company and you can give Sandra a call.
[00:35:22.512 --> 00:35:24.093]  We're one of the big distributors for these.
[00:35:24.133 --> 00:35:28.637]  She's sitting there right now to take her order for the Aeronizer or to get a free catalog.
[00:35:28.677 --> 00:35:28.898]  It's 877-605-9200.
[00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:28.958]  877-605-9200.
[00:35:28.978 --> 00:35:31.700]  And that's CSIN, where science and nature meet, the Aeronizer.
[00:35:41.391 --> 00:35:42.972]  Electronic air purifiers.
[00:35:43.032 --> 00:35:45.434]  Effective, convenient, complete solutions.
[00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.536]  Indoor air pollution.
[00:35:47.696 --> 00:35:50.318]  And the color catalog is, I don't know how many pages long.
[00:35:50.338 --> 00:35:53.661]  I think it's got to be over 50 pages long with all the descriptions of it.
[00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:56.203]  And they've got a bunch of other units.
[00:35:56.223 --> 00:35:57.504]  I mean, they've got stuff in here.
[00:35:58.425 --> 00:36:00.947]  They've got units that they sell.
[00:36:01.567 --> 00:36:07.532]  Agricultural units and industrial units that, you know, are these giant things.
[00:36:07.792 --> 00:36:08.773]  They sell to the government.
[00:36:08.813 --> 00:36:09.934]  They sell to hotels.
[00:36:11.499 --> 00:36:22.444]  This is an amazing system, but they've got the small systems that you really need to take advantage of, folks.
[00:36:22.484 --> 00:36:25.025]  You really do need to give them a call.
[00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:33.128]  We've got a bunch of different units, and tell them Alex Jones sent you to get specials on all the units, but the SS1 Aeronizer, normally 200,
[00:36:34.788 --> 00:36:47.439]  It's 160, and they say it'll do 400, 500 square feet, but I found that if you put it upstairs, I have one of these, it'll do large areas of the house because the oxygen goes out throughout the home.
[00:36:47.459 --> 00:36:50.741]  But if you put it down low in one room, it will just do that one room.
[00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:54.024]  So give them a call, folks, at 877-605-9200.
[00:36:54.044 --> 00:36:54.384]  They're there.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.601]  Right now, with the best prices on Aaronizers, you'll find anywhere.
[00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:10.543]  The company that manufactures these, Aaron Air, has been around for over 50 years.
[00:37:11.303 --> 00:37:11.623]  Okay?
[00:37:12.623 --> 00:37:13.904]  This is real stuff.
[00:37:14.184 --> 00:37:15.104]  This really works.
[00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:17.985]  It just produces oxygen.
[00:37:19.645 --> 00:37:22.926]  Complex oxygen molecules.
[00:37:24.369 --> 00:37:24.809]  All right.
[00:37:25.289 --> 00:37:27.550]  Continuing with the news, folks.
[00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.471]  Saudis consider nuclear bomb.
[00:37:31.712 --> 00:37:41.776]  Saudi Arabia, in response to the current upheaval in the Middle East, has embarked on a strategic review that includes acquiring nuclear weapons.
[00:37:42.596 --> 00:37:53.540]  The Guardian has learned the new threat of proliferation in one of the most dangerous regions of the world comes on top of a crisis over Iran's alleged nuclear program.
[00:37:54.989 --> 00:38:02.214]  By the way, Iran is not a signatory to the UN Nuclear Weapons Proliferation Act.
[00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:04.616]  Banning the production of that.
[00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:05.857]  Neither is Israel.
[00:38:05.937 --> 00:38:07.498]  Israel's got over 400 nukes.
[00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:13.042]  Dolphin, German subs, F-16s, F-18s.
[00:38:13.722 --> 00:38:17.825]  They've got an F-15 variant that carries two nuclear bombs.
[00:38:18.445 --> 00:38:20.006]  They've got fighter bombers.
[00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:23.569]  They've got helicopters that drop suitcase nukes.
[00:38:24.893 --> 00:38:26.573]  I mean, they got it all, folks.
[00:38:27.874 --> 00:38:28.794]  400 of them.
[00:38:30.054 --> 00:38:38.957]  And one of their ministers last year in Herat said, well, if Europe doesn't give us reparations, we wouldn't be in the wrong using one of these on Europe.
[00:38:39.077 --> 00:38:40.637]  That was a statement in the news, folks.
[00:38:41.398 --> 00:38:43.398]  But, I mean, again, they got 400 nukes.
[00:38:43.578 --> 00:38:47.339]  South Africa's got dozens of nukes, it's reported.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.380]  And systems to deploy them.
[00:38:51.418 --> 00:38:56.663]  You've got Pakistan with them, run by a bunch of psychopaths, protecting Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:56.683 --> 00:38:57.724]  That's now admitted from U.S.
[00:38:57.764 --> 00:38:58.525]  government documents.
[00:38:58.565 --> 00:39:00.167]  Yeah, government runs Pakistan.
[00:39:01.997 --> 00:39:11.926]  Got all this going on, and they're saying, hey, we want to go into Iran, because they're going to produce these nuclear reactors that our good buddy China helped them build, with Russia's help, and England's help, and the U.S.'
[00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:12.226]  's help.
[00:39:12.706 --> 00:39:14.188]  They're all giving them the weapons.
[00:39:14.248 --> 00:39:25.057]  It's like the old Western, where the bad sheriff or the bad gunslinger drops the gun in front of the 12-year-old, 14-year-old kid and goes, you know, as his mama's sitting there going, no, Jimmy, don't stand up to him.
[00:39:25.077 --> 00:39:26.719]  He goes, no, Ma, they killed Pa.
[00:39:27.379 --> 00:39:31.360]  The kid walks out and says, Dexter, you better get out of here, I'm gonna beat you up!
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.781]  And the bad gunslinger in the black hat throws the gun down and goes, go ahead, pick it up, kid!
[00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:40.982]  And the kid reaches and he blows the kid away and says, you saw it, he reached for the gun!
[00:39:41.002 --> 00:39:43.462]  I mean, that's what they're doing!
[00:39:45.043 --> 00:39:46.703]  It's absolutely incredible.
[00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:50.144]  It's just amazing.
[00:39:51.104 --> 00:39:51.344]  So...
[00:39:52.617 --> 00:39:55.618]  And it's Rumsfeld, as usual, arming Iraq, arming North Korea.
[00:39:55.638 --> 00:39:58.299]  He's the bag man for Garlisle Group.
[00:39:59.919 --> 00:40:01.259]  So, it continues.
[00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:02.940]  Saudi's considered a nuclear bomb.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.761]  The new threat of proliferation is one of the most dangerous regions of the world.
[00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:12.302]  Comes on top of a crisis over Iran's alleged nuclear program.
[00:40:12.322 --> 00:40:13.363]  And they've signed no document.
[00:40:13.383 --> 00:40:14.203]  They're a sovereign country.
[00:40:14.853 --> 00:40:18.036]  This new threat of proliferation is one of the most dangerous.
[00:40:18.596 --> 00:40:26.402]  A strategy paper being considered at the highest levels in Riyadh, capital Saudi Arabia, sets out three opinions.
[00:40:27.503 --> 00:40:39.192]  To acquire nuclear capability as a deterrent, to maintain or enter into an alliance with an existing nuclear power that would offer protection, try to reach a regional agreement on having a nuclear-free Middle East.
[00:40:39.756 --> 00:40:44.417]  Until now, the assumption in Washington was that Saudi Arabia was content to remain under the U.S.
[00:40:44.457 --> 00:40:47.437]  nuclear umbrella, but the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
[00:40:47.477 --> 00:40:48.338]  has steadily worsened.
[00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:53.258]  Since the September 11th attacks on New York and Washington, 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi.
[00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:59.100]  It is not known whether Saudi Arabia has taken a decision on any of the three opinions.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.920]  Let me break this down.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.400]  It's what I talked about in the first 15 minutes of the show.
[00:41:05.161 --> 00:41:07.221]  You've got a big puppet master in Europe,
[00:41:07.842 --> 00:41:09.042]  That controls America.
[00:41:09.102 --> 00:41:14.444]  So it's the puppeteer, the hand with strings going down to the puppet that's America.
[00:41:14.924 --> 00:41:16.064]  Europe's the actual puppeteer.
[00:41:16.084 --> 00:41:17.184]  The U.S.
[00:41:17.224 --> 00:41:17.985]  is the big puppet.
[00:41:18.625 --> 00:41:35.349]  And then we're a puppet with a bunch of other strings going out to Pakistan, going out to Saudi Arabia, going out to Egypt, going out to Israel, going back out to Japan, tenuously going out to China, tenuously going out to Russia,
[00:41:36.764 --> 00:41:38.326]  Pulling all these different strings.
[00:41:39.507 --> 00:41:44.373]  And those countries have also got small strings going back up into the larger marionette.
[00:41:45.734 --> 00:41:49.038]  Well, the Saudis were created by the British, by the globalists.
[00:41:49.779 --> 00:41:51.881]  The Saudis only get a small percentage of the oil money.
[00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:53.423]  The rest of it goes right into the big banks.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:01.186]  And when they were going to get blamed on 9-11, they said, fine, we'll just release that we're under five banks' ownership and following orders of the CIA.
[00:42:01.487 --> 00:42:04.429]  By the way, British intelligence is blowing stuff up in Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:04.449 --> 00:42:06.391]  The head of the government said this.
[00:42:06.672 --> 00:42:16.040]  They're blaming on us to destabilize our country, to have a radical regime overthrow us, so they can then, the globalists can then come in here with tanks and totally take the country over.
[00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:17.782]  You're destabilizing us on purpose.
[00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:18.623]  Exactly!
[00:42:19.631 --> 00:42:25.736]  These decadent sheiks have played along, and now they're getting ready to get popped, just like Saddam, who was business partners with the globalists.
[00:42:26.096 --> 00:42:27.957]  But Saddam's business partnership goes back to 1958.
[00:42:28.538 --> 00:42:32.501]  The sheiks go back to World War I, in Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:33.502]  They were just battle-wounded.
[00:42:33.522 --> 00:42:34.523]  They gave machine guns.
[00:42:34.543 --> 00:42:37.285]  The British didn't, said, you run the country now under our control.
[00:42:37.325 --> 00:42:39.226]  We'll give you 8% of the oil revenue.
[00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:40.067]  They said, yes, sir.
[00:42:42.248 --> 00:42:47.532]  And today they're a bunch of just sickening degenerate trash over there running that country, oppressing their people.
[00:42:48.193 --> 00:42:51.516]  And now they found out that's not good enough, the globals are going to take it away from them.
[00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:54.938]  And so they're saying, uh-uh!
[00:42:56.119 --> 00:42:57.541]  U.S., you're behind the terror.
[00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:06.328]  And so now what, five of the princes have all died in car wrecks or bombings or shootings or being ruled suicides.
[00:43:07.249 --> 00:43:08.910]  Everybody, all the whistles getting blasted.
[00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:16.070]  It goes back to the Karloff Group in the 70s with the Bin Ladens and the Bushes and all the rest of it.
[00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:17.271]  This is all admitted, folks!
[00:43:19.052 --> 00:43:23.334]  So, this is the reality of what we're dealing with here.
[00:43:24.354 --> 00:43:28.496]  And so, Saudi Arabia now had an agreement not to put jets on their border with Israel.
[00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:29.397]  They've done that now.
[00:43:30.557 --> 00:43:30.757]  F-16s.
[00:43:30.918 --> 00:43:35.260]  They got a whole bunch of them out there now.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.500]  F-14s, you name it.
[00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:41.623]  And they're running around wanting to get a nuke because they want to be able to blackmail everybody and be left alone.
[00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:44.551]  They've taken the lesson in North Korea.
[00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:47.652]  They're going to find out real quick they're falling into the trap.
[00:43:49.253 --> 00:43:53.535]  And they need to all come clean with the dirt before they're all dying in car wrecks and all.
[00:43:55.156 --> 00:43:56.277]  This is terrible, folks.
[00:43:56.397 --> 00:43:57.377]  This is what the globalists do.
[00:43:57.437 --> 00:44:00.259]  And again, America's going to play the part of the bad guy.
[00:44:00.279 --> 00:44:03.120]  We're going to be the guys that go in and take over the countries and do all this.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.381]  And our troops are going to get shot.
[00:44:05.928 --> 00:44:10.193]  They're going to have dirty, hippie types come out and protest the war and make it all look left-wing.
[00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:13.758]  So when conservatives see that, they go, oh no, I'm for this endless war.
[00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:15.520]  Just like they did in the 60s.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.907]  They'd have the beatniks, the communists, bust some windows in a small town and say we're against the war and act stupid.
[00:44:21.778 --> 00:44:25.461]  Whereas if they wore suits and ties and talked to folks, they could get the war over real quick.
[00:44:26.042 --> 00:44:27.703]  This is all elaborate theater, folks.
[00:44:27.723 --> 00:44:28.524]  That's all this is.
[00:44:29.024 --> 00:44:30.065]  That's what the globalists do.
[00:44:30.486 --> 00:44:31.827]  They don't build anything.
[00:44:31.867 --> 00:44:32.888]  They don't make anything.
[00:44:32.928 --> 00:44:33.628]  They manipulate.
[00:44:33.649 --> 00:44:34.129]  They lie.
[00:44:34.169 --> 00:44:34.769]  They control.
[00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.630]  They connive.
[00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:36.571]  They pay people off.
[00:44:36.911 --> 00:44:38.713]  That's what the rulers of the earth do.
[00:44:38.953 --> 00:44:39.674]  They're criminals.
[00:44:39.934 --> 00:44:43.617]  Sophisticated criminals with ancient management systems perfected.
[00:44:44.778 --> 00:44:47.741]  Only by knowing the management techniques can you defeat it.
[00:44:48.925 --> 00:45:08.430]  And when 70% of the people don't know where Iraq is, and when 70% of the people hear last week that, I don't know what the numbers are, but I'd guess 70% bought that too, that, oh, that Laden's right-hand man, a new tape, he's going to get us, and no one went, hey, wait a minute, they claim they captured him 18 months ago.
[00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.011]  You know, they know people are so ignorant on the facts,
[00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:12.907]  That they don't understand this.
[00:45:12.947 --> 00:45:14.508]  And by the way, you could figure this out.
[00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:16.330]  I hear you call into the talk shows.
[00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.791]  You know the baseball scores from 1935.
[00:45:18.491 --> 00:45:22.254]  You know the football scores from the Ice Bowl.
[00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:25.477]  You know, the Super Bowl.
[00:45:26.378 --> 00:45:31.342]  You know all about, you know, where Nolan Ryan lives and what shoe size he's got.
[00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:36.406]  So you can figure out where Iraq is.
[00:45:36.446 --> 00:45:39.328]  And you can figure out the names of the people they claim are the terrorists.
[00:45:42.518 --> 00:45:46.861]  I don't want to sit up here on my soapbox, folks, but we really are being pushed into World War III.
[00:45:48.142 --> 00:45:51.365]  They got the national drafts lined up, and this time it isn't just for young men.
[00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:56.509]  It isn't just going to be poor farm boys and poor black boys and poor Hispanics.
[00:45:57.089 --> 00:45:58.370]  It's going to be everybody.
[00:45:59.531 --> 00:46:02.934]  It's going to be your daughters, and they like it when half of them come back pregnant.
[00:46:03.034 --> 00:46:05.656]  I mean, it's literally to supply the officers with camp prostitutes.
[00:46:06.425 --> 00:46:10.167]  And to get your daughters into the forced inoculations, that's the real reason for it.
[00:46:10.687 --> 00:46:11.807]  And to break up the society.
[00:46:12.368 --> 00:46:13.608]  No, it's going to be everybody.
[00:46:13.628 --> 00:46:15.049]  18 to 49.
[00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:24.573]  And you're going to have to work here, quote, domestically, most of you, digging ditches, doing your normal job, then going and working in the factory four or five more hours.
[00:46:24.933 --> 00:46:28.154]  Your kids are going to have to stay at the public schools, they're going to have to sleep at the schools.
[00:46:28.894 --> 00:46:32.056]  Because of the terrorists attacking the factories, you're going to have to live at the factories.
[00:46:32.496 --> 00:46:34.737]  I have seen Ridge saying this, okay?
[00:46:35.939 --> 00:46:40.262]  I saw them in 99 in North Carolina training the base to run the local factories.
[00:46:40.743 --> 00:46:43.185]  You're going to be the equivalent of a Soviet slave.
[00:46:43.825 --> 00:46:46.547]  But we gotta do it after the terrorists nuked Chicago.
[00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:49.569]  After they released smallpox in Houston.
[00:46:51.251 --> 00:46:52.492]  I know it sounds tough.
[00:46:52.552 --> 00:46:53.693]  I had to turn my guns in.
[00:46:53.713 --> 00:46:55.694]  That's because the terrorists kept striking with guns.
[00:46:55.734 --> 00:46:58.016]  We had more sniper attacks.
[00:46:58.596 --> 00:47:01.799]  I live at the factory and my children live at the public school.
[00:47:03.439 --> 00:47:11.648]  Well, actually, I'm going to be a trustee next month and I'm going to be allowed to go back to my house, but I'm going to have to wear a badge and a black beret and keep tabs on the other trustees.
[00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:17.235]  You know, I don't like it, but we have to define Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:18.997]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:19.617 --> 00:47:21.199]  Al-Qaeda got me!
[00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:22.581]  I had to fight them!
[00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:25.709]  I know right now you don't believe me, remember?
[00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:34.051]  Remember I told you they were going to use Bin Laden to attack New York in July 2001, two months before I said call the White House, tell them don't let, don't, don't say Bin Laden attacked New York, remember?
[00:47:34.071 --> 00:47:35.852]  Because I can tell from the indicators.
[00:47:36.312 --> 00:47:50.755]  If they get their way, they're going to be microchipped, living in giant work camps for your safety, as your youth march out to be blown to pieces, fighting the North Koreans, and fighting the Armenians, and occupying all these countries.
[00:47:51.627 --> 00:47:55.909]  And all these bureaucrats are going to strut around and order you around and you're going to thank them.
[00:47:56.529 --> 00:47:56.970]  Thank you.
[00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:58.731]  Thank you, authority.
[00:47:58.811 --> 00:47:59.951]  Thank you, official.
[00:48:01.052 --> 00:48:05.174]  Thank you for all you do in the fight against Al Qaeda!
[00:48:08.295 --> 00:48:09.516]  You think I'm joking, don't you?
[00:48:09.956 --> 00:48:10.597]  You really do.
[00:48:10.657 --> 00:48:10.917]  No, no.
[00:48:11.377 --> 00:48:12.017]  I've seen them.
[00:48:12.137 --> 00:48:13.378]  This is the plan.
[00:48:15.484 --> 00:48:16.726]  Who would have thought we'd be here?
[00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:21.755]  The face scanning cameras and tracker chips on all the phones and giant prisons being built everywhere.
[00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:23.658]  Who would have thought we would be here ten years ago?
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.802]  Satellite tracking in the cars.
[00:48:27.264 --> 00:48:27.986]  Patriot Act.
[00:48:28.707 --> 00:48:29.308]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.303 --> 00:48:36.606]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:38.887]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:48:39.128 --> 00:48:46.232]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:48:46.372 --> 00:48:57.918]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:48:58.279 --> 00:49:00.500]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.120]  We're good to go!
[00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:35.639]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[00:49:35.819 --> 00:49:41.785]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[00:49:41.985 --> 00:49:44.808]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[00:49:44.968 --> 00:49:52.335]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[00:49:52.535 --> 00:50:01.005]  The Social Security Number Not Required Policy Manual from Nonumber.com tells you how to assert your rights and live free as an unenumerated American.
[00:50:01.125 --> 00:50:04.429]  Go online at Nonumber.com or call 1-800-831-6141 and order
[00:50:07.452 --> 00:50:07.852]  I think so.
[00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.971]  This is the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:35.171 --> 00:50:39.572]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:44.134]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:47.255]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:50:47.295 --> 00:50:51.516]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:51.576 --> 00:50:58.518]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:00.639]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:00.879 --> 00:51:11.447]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:11.647 --> 00:51:17.031]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:20.913]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:20.933 --> 00:51:21.294]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:21.314 --> 00:51:22.575]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:51:36.045 --> 00:51:38.868]  Folks, you really, really should get my videos.
[00:51:38.948 --> 00:51:48.957]  Police State, Three Total Enslavement, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:51:48.977 --> 00:51:53.301]  There's a way to describe all the incredible stuff, the amazing stuff you'll see in these.
[00:51:54.242 --> 00:51:57.485]  Take two minutes from the two-hour, five-minute film, The Takeover.
[00:51:58.391 --> 00:52:02.094]  I walk into the police station, Sheriff's Department, in Brooksville, Florida.
[00:52:02.674 --> 00:52:06.878]  I say, hi, I'd like to talk wearing a polo shirt and, you know, dress clothes.
[00:52:07.438 --> 00:52:12.782]  Hi, I'd like to speak to your public information officer about the military training with the police.
[00:52:12.802 --> 00:52:20.909]  At that point, a woman comes screaming around the corner wearing a Marine Corps shirt saying, I want martial law, line them up and shoot them, kill, kill, kill.
[00:52:23.726 --> 00:52:24.206]  Seriously.
[00:52:25.167 --> 00:52:27.027]  A woman comes running, screaming around the corner.
[00:52:27.187 --> 00:52:27.547]  Kill him.
[00:52:28.368 --> 00:52:29.448]  Light him up and shoot him.
[00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:31.449]  Kill him.
[00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:36.050]  And then another woman runs out in a suit and says, what's your problem?
[00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:37.251]  Why are you asking questions?
[00:52:37.291 --> 00:52:39.971]  And you know, it's just, I don't know, that's two minutes of the film.
[00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:42.412]  You might want to just see that two minutes.
[00:52:42.672 --> 00:52:44.853]  You know, I just walk in places and they do this.
[00:52:44.893 --> 00:52:47.554]  It's like, I don't know.
[00:52:49.255 --> 00:52:49.815]  It's amazing.
[00:52:51.078 --> 00:52:51.918]  This is real stuff.
[00:52:52.279 --> 00:52:53.519]  You take Road to Tyranny.
[00:52:53.599 --> 00:53:06.105]  I have the big FEMA guy, Delta Force guy, there in Kansas City, now with FEMA of course, a little military guy, and he says all Founding Fathers are terrorists, all Christians are terrorists.
[00:53:06.445 --> 00:53:08.346]  He lists George Washington as a terrorist.
[00:53:09.066 --> 00:53:10.867]  Says Christians are the enemy of the federal government.
[00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:11.627]  That's an exact quote.
[00:53:11.727 --> 00:53:12.107]  Period.
[00:53:12.728 --> 00:53:17.630]  Not Christian identity, or not this group, or not that group, and not some particular subgroup people don't like or something.
[00:53:19.224 --> 00:53:19.904]  No, everybody!
[00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:21.125]  You're just all terrorists!
[00:53:21.425 --> 00:53:24.686]  And, uh, you might want to see the video of a room of police sitting there.
[00:53:25.086 --> 00:53:26.326]  The police do the answers!
[00:53:26.386 --> 00:53:29.347]  They said Founding Fathers Christians, and they went, good, good.
[00:53:29.367 --> 00:53:33.488]  And I've talked to police across the country who've been in for a while, or just got out of police academy.
[00:53:33.508 --> 00:53:34.469]  They're all being taught that.
[00:53:34.889 --> 00:53:36.069]  The exact thing that's in the film.
[00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:38.570]  I have the training manuals in the film.
[00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.551]  I don't know, that's about three or four minutes of that, uh, 170-minute film on DVD.
[00:53:41.571 --> 00:53:42.431]  Uh, 220-something minutes on VHS.
[00:53:47.068 --> 00:53:47.388]  I don't know.
[00:53:47.448 --> 00:53:49.969]  You just might want to get it and have it.
[00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:52.471]  It's indescribable.
[00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:54.391]  Police State 3 is an absolute nightmare.
[00:53:55.192 --> 00:53:56.272]  Two hours and forty minutes.
[00:53:56.372 --> 00:53:58.873]  Every minute has some new horrible evil the Globals are doing.
[00:53:58.933 --> 00:53:59.894]  It's admitted out in the open.
[00:54:01.598 --> 00:54:04.021]  You want to change people's lives, these videos are doing it.
[00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:04.442]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:04.462 --> 00:54:04.582]  888-253-3139.
[00:54:04.602 --> 00:54:07.045]  Or Infowars.com to order.
[00:54:07.186 --> 00:54:09.088]  The new book is Order Out of Chaos.
[00:54:09.108 --> 00:54:12.633]  Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order by Paul Watson.
[00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.290]  It's excellent as well.
[00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:19.970]  We carry that.
[00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:23.771]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of the films or two or more of the books.
[00:54:24.711 --> 00:54:30.573]  So you can also write to us at the 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:54:30.673 --> 00:54:31.573]  Eight U.S.
[00:54:34.894 --> 00:54:36.874]  soldiers killed in Iraq ambush.
[00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:43.075]  Oh, that's terrible, but nothing compared to who's going to die of that depleted uranium, which they admit they've now got radiation sickness from.
[00:54:43.095 --> 00:54:44.196]  1,900 times safe levels.
[00:54:46.505 --> 00:54:50.366]  Kind of like K-19, but you die a little bit slower than what you see in that movie.
[00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:57.968]  Eight American soldiers reported to have been killed in an ambush in the Iraq town of Qaeda.
[00:54:58.648 --> 00:55:00.209]  Again, I'm not Arab, I can't pronounce this.
[00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:06.811]  Arab satellite TV stations Al-Arabiya, yeah I got that one, said the attack took place on a main road.
[00:55:06.831 --> 00:55:08.451]  Two U.S.
[00:55:08.551 --> 00:55:12.052]  tanks surrounded a smoldering transport truck and helicopters hovered above.
[00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:19.901]  A reporter at the scene could not get close enough to verify the captured reports and was fired on by one of the tanks with three rounds from a .50 cal machine gun.
[00:55:20.742 --> 00:55:22.062]  Oh yeah, that's why they killed the reporters.
[00:55:22.242 --> 00:55:24.543]  That one Reuters guy found the mass graves U.S.
[00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:28.604]  troops and the tank rolled right up, knew exactly who he was, and killed him.
[00:55:29.565 --> 00:55:31.765]  A reporter at the scene could not get close, he ended up being fired at.
[00:55:31.785 --> 00:55:35.907]  It appeared the Americans were trying to protect themselves until reinforcements arrived.
[00:55:36.887 --> 00:55:38.788]  The Americans were taking fire from unknown positions.
[00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:42.269]  The town is about 18 miles from Valjala.
[00:55:43.877 --> 00:55:44.778]  Well, that's just terrible.
[00:55:44.798 --> 00:55:45.378]  It really is.
[00:55:45.439 --> 00:55:46.459]  But hey, bring them on.
[00:55:46.499 --> 00:55:48.581]  The government says they don't care in their ivory tower.
[00:55:48.621 --> 00:55:49.983]  You know, they never served.
[00:55:50.443 --> 00:55:51.764]  Well, got to go AWOL.
[00:55:51.985 --> 00:55:53.046]  No one else is allowed to.
[00:55:54.647 --> 00:55:57.890]  You know, walk out of the military for a year and nobody cares.
[00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.971]  It's not a news item.
[00:55:58.991 --> 00:56:00.913]  The rest of them are chicken hawks.
[00:56:00.953 --> 00:56:01.954]  Never served in the military.
[00:56:03.115 --> 00:56:04.216]  Hey, bring them on, huh?
[00:56:04.916 --> 00:56:06.057]  Bring them on!
[00:56:07.018 --> 00:56:08.560]  Bring on that $87 billion, too.
[00:56:09.993 --> 00:56:10.373]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:10.594 --> 00:56:12.575]  Hey, don't worry, your children are just gonna pay for it.
[00:56:12.875 --> 00:56:14.457]  But the bankers get the money and the oil.
[00:56:15.557 --> 00:56:18.640]  Alright, second hour, we'll get to your calls and a bunch of other news.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.180]  Stay with us.
[00:56:21.522 --> 00:56:26.826]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:56:27.026 --> 00:56:29.107]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:56:29.348 --> 00:56:32.170]  This portable system is the size of a book when full.
[00:56:35.953 --> 00:56:39.095]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.701 --> 00:56:47.342]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.002 --> 00:56:49.043]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.764 --> 00:56:50.865]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.526 --> 00:56:52.346]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.107 --> 00:56:55.029]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.049 --> 00:56:58.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.852 --> 00:57:02.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.538 --> 00:57:11.284]  The Globalist and PNAC documents, Project for an American Century documents written by the Vice President and others,
[00:57:12.523 --> 00:57:23.066]  ...say that the use of race-specific bioweapons needs to be made a legitimate tactic, killing certain races of human beings on the face of the earth.
[00:57:24.266 --> 00:57:28.867]  Because if you release such a weapon, obviously you know that can and probably will happen to a great extent.
[00:57:29.927 --> 00:57:39.269]  The globalists relocated hundreds of millions of people and killed them last century, whether it was fascist or communist countries, it's what the bankers want, to break down old societies, it's what they do.
[00:57:39.769 --> 00:57:41.830]  If you're Aborigines, black, white, or
[00:57:42.575 --> 00:57:47.559]  Around, they slaughter you and push you off your land into compact cities to work in factories.
[00:57:48.239 --> 00:57:58.666]  If you're in an industrialized world, they put a lot of the population in prisons, create wars, overtake countries, relocate people into mass work camps or big agribusiness systems.
[00:57:59.147 --> 00:58:03.910]  This is what they do, and they're gearing up to do it again in this century in the name of fighting terror.
[00:58:05.126 --> 00:58:06.807]  They're engineering World War 4.
[00:58:07.448 --> 00:58:08.148]  They don't call it 3.
[00:58:09.009 --> 00:58:10.950]  They call their phony Cold War, World War 3.
[00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.611]  They call this World War 4.
[00:58:13.272 --> 00:58:17.255]  Where do you think World War 4 or 3, whichever you like to call it, is going to start?
[00:58:17.715 --> 00:58:18.035]  India?
[00:58:18.075 --> 00:58:18.676]  Pakistan?
[00:58:19.136 --> 00:58:19.716]  North Korea?
[00:58:19.736 --> 00:58:20.397]  South Korea?
[00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.118]  Or will Japan attack North Korea?
[00:58:22.558 --> 00:58:26.341]  Japan says they will attack, and Japanese don't just say things, folks.
[00:58:27.382 --> 00:58:27.862]  They'll do it.
[00:58:29.523 --> 00:58:31.825]  They say they're going to launch, and they say, yeah, we got some nukes.
[00:58:32.768 --> 00:58:35.010]  That's in the back of the paper by the way, last few months.
[00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:38.653]  If North Korea puts a missile on the pad, what's going to happen?
[00:58:38.693 --> 00:58:40.294]  What's going to develop out of all this?
[00:58:41.875 --> 00:58:43.016]  What do you see happening?
[00:58:43.056 --> 00:58:51.523]  And can we get the sports fans and the people that watch, you know, NYPD Blue to turn off the TV for five minutes and learn of what's really happening inside the New World Order?
[00:58:51.763 --> 00:58:54.586]  How they're escalating this order out of chaos system.
[00:58:56.027 --> 00:58:59.990]  Now we haven't gotten the calls yet and we're going to get to them, okay, in the next segment.
[00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:02.272]  And if you want to join us on air,
[00:59:03.228 --> 00:59:09.410]  If you disagree with me, if you agree with me, if you've got a point you want to make, or a particular news item you want to discuss, wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.570]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.011]  I'll go to your calls quick.
[00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:17.833]  Give each person about a minute and a half to make their comment about World War III, about this whole escalation.
[00:59:24.967 --> 00:59:27.129]  About the destruction of liberties here domestically.
[00:59:27.669 --> 00:59:31.412]  About the good news that people are learning that Patriot Act 1 and 2 do affect citizens.
[00:59:31.953 --> 00:59:33.154]  Any of these key issues.
[00:59:33.174 --> 00:59:34.194]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:34.214 --> 00:59:41.520]  And you always go to the front of the line if you disagree with me.
[00:59:44.042 --> 00:59:46.844]  And normally I've gotten good about letting folks talk that disagree with me.
[00:59:47.765 --> 00:59:52.849]  The other day I kind of didn't do a good job when somebody said that the border wasn't wide open and
[00:59:54.545 --> 01:00:00.147]  We didn't have all these illegals, and I just didn't know what to say to it and started trying to put him on hold, but I can explain it.
[01:00:00.187 --> 01:00:02.227]  That's like saying the sun didn't come up this morning.
[01:00:02.507 --> 01:00:03.588]  I live in Texas, folks.
[01:00:03.608 --> 01:00:06.949]  I mean, you've seen the results of it to your jobs around the country.
[01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:15.491]  But if you disagree with me, I will, I don't know, maybe I'll tell Mark that no matter what I say, turn me down so they can talk.
[01:00:16.445 --> 01:00:21.847]  It's like, no matter what I say later, you know, let them talk, because it just makes me so mad when we hear pure garbage.
[01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:23.007]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 Eight more U.S.
[01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:23.667]  soldiers killed.
[01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:24.507]  Real tragedy.
[01:00:24.527 --> 01:00:28.369]  On the Saudi sand, they may develop a nuclear bomb.
[01:00:28.409 --> 01:00:29.149]  West Nile cases.
[01:00:29.189 --> 01:00:31.470]  This is Rocky Mountain News.
[01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:32.570]  Could be as many as 35,000 cases.
[01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:32.830]  In Colorado!
[01:00:46.741 --> 01:00:48.242]  I know we got a lot of Coloradans listening.
[01:00:48.302 --> 01:00:49.263]  What is it like there?
[01:00:49.643 --> 01:00:51.425]  Why is it getting so much worse every year?
[01:00:53.326 --> 01:00:55.287]  Also, Miami police on orange alert.
[01:00:56.929 --> 01:01:01.652]  Ashcroft FBI to reveal Patriot Act data.
[01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:02.533]  More propaganda.
[01:01:02.593 --> 01:01:02.993]  Japan.
[01:01:03.033 --> 01:01:05.635]  Toshiba develops RFID tag for apparel.
[01:01:06.115 --> 01:01:07.116]  Track your clothes.
[01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:13.101]  Baby hair study shows autistic children may have altered response to heavy metals.
[01:01:13.943 --> 01:01:17.486]  And reduced extraction of toxic metal may explain autism link.
[01:01:18.067 --> 01:01:20.109]  Yeah, that's just part of the reprogramming of the children.
[01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.432]  Look, it's just a lot of news coming up.
[01:01:23.572 --> 01:01:24.773]  You don't want to miss this show.
[01:01:24.793 --> 01:01:30.598]  And what do you think about this sicko band in Tampa that's going to kill somebody today?
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.182]  It's part of the right to die.
[01:01:35.763 --> 01:01:38.345]  But they're going to watch the person kill themselves.
[01:01:38.966 --> 01:01:39.666]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:39.686 --> 01:01:40.047]  Stay with us.
[01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:50.300]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.306]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:01:55.526 --> 01:02:01.174]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:05.936]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:13.299]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:02:13.339 --> 01:02:17.861]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:02:18.041 --> 01:02:20.542]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:27.485]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:02:41.647 --> 01:02:46.290]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:52.414]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[01:02:52.614 --> 01:02:55.455]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[01:02:55.595 --> 01:03:02.980]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:11.650]  The Social Security Number Not Required Policy Manual from Nonumber.com tells you how to assert your rights and live free as an unenumerated American.

[01:03:45.177 --> 01:03:48.680]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.723]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:03:52.923 --> 01:03:59.108]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:03:59.508 --> 01:04:07.414]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:13.178]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:04:13.318 --> 01:04:17.100]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.322]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:04:19.382 --> 01:04:21.563]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[01:04:42.038 --> 01:04:44.660]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:45.221 --> 01:04:48.104]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:50.926 --> 01:04:57.853]  Frontman for Hell on Earth takes his case to Bay Area Airwaves.
[01:04:57.893 --> 01:05:00.275]  The leader of the shock rock band Hell on Earth
[01:05:00.976 --> 01:05:10.639]  Put to the airwaves Wednesday to explain why someone would want to commit suicide during the group's concert at the State Theater in St.
[01:05:10.739 --> 01:05:12.980]  Petersburg next month.
[01:05:15.681 --> 01:05:17.482]  And, uh, it goes on.
[01:05:17.562 --> 01:05:26.125]  Billy Toilet, excuse me, Turlote, told 98 Rock's Bubba and Love Sponge, aka Tom Clem,
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.804]  I mean, don't you know that Britney Spears and that old lady Madonna got their French kissing on the stage?
[01:05:52.392 --> 01:05:55.235]  I mean, they allowed it to degrade your society and break down the family.
[01:05:55.275 --> 01:05:57.217]  That's the admitted policy of the federal government.
[01:05:57.797 --> 01:06:06.326]  But the secondary reason why that trash did it, and was used by the establishment, was because it would get them publicity.
[01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:09.409]  And here they are saying, oh, we didn't do this.
[01:06:10.289 --> 01:06:12.852]  We didn't do this for publicity.
[01:06:15.021 --> 01:06:21.303]  And they're going to have somebody killed during their concert and they openly worship Satan and do all this stuff.
[01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:25.565]  They'd rather have an assisted suicide, but because of the way the laws are written, they can't do it.
[01:06:25.985 --> 01:06:37.989]  Toilet said, I mean, Tourlette said in an interview Wednesday morning with Scum, that's the other talk show host name, so bringing dying with dignity to the forefront is really what it's all about.
[01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:43.271]  And here's the band, I mean, they dress up in these little satanic outfits and
[01:06:44.443 --> 01:06:45.964]  You know, try to dress up like zombies.
[01:06:45.984 --> 01:06:47.324]  They're all about death and evil.
[01:06:48.325 --> 01:06:51.906]  It's about, it's like Kevorkian, who lost his medical license in two states.
[01:06:52.766 --> 01:06:57.688]  He was caught in the dark with a dead body at one major hospital, according to the Associated Press, doing something with it.
[01:06:57.708 --> 01:06:59.849]  We won't mention that here, because of children.
[01:07:01.129 --> 01:07:05.991]  Kevorkian paints paintings, I saw on PBS, of demons eating babies as they come out of women's wounds.
[01:07:06.031 --> 01:07:07.372]  I'm sorry to go into that much detail.
[01:07:08.152 --> 01:07:09.773]  I watched Tom Cruise in Fawning.
[01:07:10.874 --> 01:07:18.561]  Haunting actresses and supermodels going, ah, ah, ah, literally giggling up and jumping up and down, worshipping him.
[01:07:19.441 --> 01:07:24.105]  They have Dr. Peter Singer to the Governor's Conference to speak to them.
[01:07:24.305 --> 01:07:25.787]  They legitimize this, see?
[01:07:26.107 --> 01:07:27.508]  But, I mean, now it's right out in the open.
[01:07:27.528 --> 01:07:34.974]  A group that talks about death and suicide and murder and slaughter and how great evil is and, you know, dress up like zombies.
[01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:36.956]  Looking at a photo here.
[01:07:40.049 --> 01:07:41.490]  You know, just trying to be shocking.
[01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.810]  Just really weak, pathetic people.
[01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.631]  Doing this.
[01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.132]  Selling this to your youth.
[01:07:48.252 --> 01:07:50.633]  Selling death and suicide to the youth.
[01:07:50.653 --> 01:07:54.054]  I mean, it just makes me want to throw up.
[01:07:56.895 --> 01:07:58.736]  Makes me want to vomit all over these people.
[01:07:58.776 --> 01:08:00.256]  I mean, they're just trash.
[01:08:01.617 --> 01:08:03.578]  They're death-loving trash.
[01:08:03.698 --> 01:08:05.018]  Trying to sell us death.
[01:08:07.896 --> 01:08:12.340]  Notice down in Florida, it's a place where people can audibly beg for food, and they're not given food.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.461]  They have their tubes jerked out and they beg for food.
[01:08:15.162 --> 01:08:17.544]  We've had the Wall Street Journal writer Wesley Smith on.
[01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:26.151]  We've read the names of, well, Mr. Wendlandt out in California could talk, and they took his food and he begged for three days and died.
[01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:29.694]  And they murder people left and right, folks.
[01:08:29.754 --> 01:08:31.095]  It's not, quote, I want to die.
[01:08:31.115 --> 01:08:32.136]  It's we're going to kill you.
[01:08:32.436 --> 01:08:34.598]  But you didn't know that because the nightly news didn't tell you.
[01:08:37.085 --> 01:08:38.285]  And so what's going to happen to you?
[01:08:40.646 --> 01:08:41.646]  Let's talk to Zach.
[01:08:41.666 --> 01:08:44.226]  Zach, where are you calling us from today?
[01:08:44.766 --> 01:08:45.627]  Charlotte, North Carolina.
[01:08:45.827 --> 01:08:46.447]  Welcome, sir.
[01:08:46.827 --> 01:08:47.827]  How's the hurricane doing?
[01:08:47.847 --> 01:08:48.907]  I don't know.
[01:08:48.927 --> 01:08:49.687]  I haven't seen it yet.
[01:08:50.747 --> 01:08:52.628]  Well, they say it started running into the coast.
[01:08:52.988 --> 01:08:54.248]  Is it dark outside?
[01:08:54.288 --> 01:08:54.768]  Is it raining?
[01:08:55.248 --> 01:08:56.949]  I can't tell anything from Charlotte.
[01:08:57.029 --> 01:09:02.010]  Probably if we get further towards the coast, we'll probably see something.
[01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:02.810]  Okay.
[01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:04.390]  I was just wondering,
[01:09:05.185 --> 01:09:10.489]  I've been researching about the Freemasons and stuff like that, and I was just trying to get some more info about that.
[01:09:10.509 --> 01:09:14.631]  I heard that they have a big pull on the way the government's running stuff.
[01:09:15.552 --> 01:09:17.693]  Like 33-degree masons, you know?
[01:09:17.713 --> 01:09:21.576]  Well, people claiming to be masons have been giving us some death threats lately.
[01:09:21.696 --> 01:09:31.222]  I hadn't gotten death threats really in years, and I've been getting death threats again, saying, you talk about I'm a Sonic Brothers, somebody's gonna blow your head off, boy!
[01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.392]  But I don't know if that's Masons doing that.
[01:09:36.513 --> 01:09:38.554]  Both my great-grandfathers were Masons.
[01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.536]  And they weren't bad people.
[01:09:40.816 --> 01:09:42.677]  But one of them was a 33rd degree.
[01:09:44.098 --> 01:09:48.001]  And he told my father, my father's great-uncle told him, don't join the Masons.
[01:09:48.461 --> 01:09:50.483]  It really is satanic at the higher level.
[01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:55.646]  So that's older Masons telling their young not to join it.
[01:09:56.387 --> 01:09:58.528]  Most of the people that died at the Alamo were Masons.
[01:09:58.588 --> 01:09:59.549]  But they were low level.
[01:09:59.589 --> 01:10:00.710]  They weren't bad people.
[01:10:01.539 --> 01:10:07.621]  George Washington was a Mason, but then he spoke out about how it was being taken over by the Illuminati in the 1770s.
[01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:18.725]  John Quincy Adams had the Masonic Order banned for a while in this country because it got so out of hand.
[01:10:19.185 --> 01:10:25.687]  Any secret organization that's set up like an intelligence agency is perfect for criminals to take over.
[01:10:25.927 --> 01:10:27.488]  I mean, let's see the CIA's good.
[01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:29.989]  Since 1947, which they weren't.
[01:10:30.549 --> 01:10:32.750]  But bad people have, quote, gotten into control.
[01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:36.151]  You give somebody this mechanism, it's a recipe for disaster.
[01:10:37.052 --> 01:10:40.093]  So a lot of masons are 32 degree, they don't know anything.
[01:10:40.113 --> 01:10:43.555]  They don't know that there's 360 degrees above 33rd.
[01:10:45.155 --> 01:10:48.597]  They don't understand the more esoteric, deeper meanings.
[01:10:49.577 --> 01:10:50.718]  And they're completely in the dark.
[01:10:51.408 --> 01:10:52.689]  And they don't understand this.
[01:10:52.929 --> 01:10:57.834]  It's like most people that get into white magic think, oh, it's about love and positive thinking.
[01:10:58.134 --> 01:11:05.340]  They don't know that it's satanic cults recruiting through white magic circles when it all leads to black magic, as Anton LaVey said.
[01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:08.042]  So that's really what's going on.
[01:11:08.082 --> 01:11:08.743]  It's like any of this.
[01:11:08.763 --> 01:11:10.084]  The average cop's a good guy.
[01:11:10.524 --> 01:11:15.949]  But the police chief in a major city is a CIA operative shipping in cocaine, working for the feds.
[01:11:17.319 --> 01:11:19.240]  Again, it's about compartmentalization.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:25.245]  The average person at the Pentagon's good, but key areas of the Pentagon were controlling those aircraft on September 11th.
[01:11:26.146 --> 01:11:34.292]  And then when that came out, they had to get ahead of the story that we were breaking with Stanley Hilton and Bob Mills, former Chief of Staff.
[01:11:34.532 --> 01:11:35.934]  So they said, oh yeah, the AP.
[01:11:35.954 --> 01:11:39.717]  Yeah, we were running a drill of flying planes into buildings that morning, but it was just a drill.
[01:11:40.097 --> 01:11:42.459]  That way, the folks that saw it happening were freaking out.
[01:11:43.146 --> 01:11:45.347]  Now the Pentagon doesn't have to kill half the Pentagon.
[01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:46.908]  That's a lot of folks to kill.
[01:11:47.368 --> 01:11:48.288]  They need personnel.
[01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:51.850]  That gets morale back up when the whole Pentagon knew they'd done the attack.
[01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:53.411]  They go, oh no, men, women.
[01:11:53.651 --> 01:11:54.571]  That was just a drill.
[01:11:54.712 --> 01:11:57.113]  And then a lot of weak-minded people go, oh, OK.
[01:11:57.633 --> 01:11:58.593]  Same thing with Masons.
[01:11:59.234 --> 01:11:59.454]  Yeah.
[01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:06.117]  I was just also wondering, is there any good presidential candidates, like, you know, that would actually
[01:12:07.421 --> 01:12:08.302]  Well, let's look at them.
[01:12:08.402 --> 01:12:22.635]  Dean's New World Order, Wesley Clark, four-star general, former head of NATO, Rhodes Scholar, bunk bed partners, roommates with Bill Clinton, tried to start World War III and had to be physically restrained.
[01:12:22.655 --> 01:12:28.340]  I mean, they had to actually block the door, stop him from giving the order to attack the Russians.
[01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:41.036]  I mean, they want it, folks, and you've got John Kerry sculling bones, Bush sculling bones, they're all CFR, and no, there are no good candidates, Ralph Nader's New World Order, Shell Operator, they all are.
[01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:43.438]  So we're, like, stuck, then?
[01:12:44.579 --> 01:12:44.960]  Pardon me?
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.423]  I mean, how... I don't see how we can...
[01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:52.318]  Get out of this situation if there's no good presidential candidates.
[01:12:52.579 --> 01:12:52.799]  Hey!
[01:12:52.979 --> 01:12:53.179]  Hey!
[01:12:53.319 --> 01:12:53.499]  Hey!
[01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:58.102]  If the Sheriff doesn't let the IRS get you or CPS or any of this, they can't.
[01:12:58.642 --> 01:13:01.904]  Used to, the Feds tried to do something, the Sheriff should throw them out.
[01:13:02.804 --> 01:13:05.045]  The Sheriffs, and now they're getting rid of the Sheriffs.
[01:13:05.405 --> 01:13:10.808]  The Sheriffs, who are the authority, are allowing somebody through color of law to say, you gotta follow my orders.
[01:13:11.329 --> 01:13:12.709]  It's time for Sheriffs to say no.
[01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:14.590]  Let me give you another example.
[01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:15.351]  Okay.
[01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.652]  Uh, it's like these, uh,
[01:13:19.773 --> 01:13:21.014]  It's like the smallpox shot.
[01:13:21.034 --> 01:13:25.277]  Remember a year ago they said all the medical workers and cops and firemen have to take it.
[01:13:25.297 --> 01:13:25.997]  That was on the news.
[01:13:26.057 --> 01:13:26.658]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:26.918 --> 01:13:31.601]  No one, I mean like 99 point plus percent said no.
[01:13:32.322 --> 01:13:33.263]  So they had to back off.
[01:13:33.303 --> 01:13:38.306]  Now they're talking about a draft to make them take it.
[01:13:38.366 --> 01:13:39.467]  It's like Ceausescu.
[01:13:41.108 --> 01:13:44.330]  Finally one day the secret police and everybody just said we're not doing this anymore.
[01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:45.151]  No!
[01:13:46.312 --> 01:13:46.572]  No!
[01:13:47.512 --> 01:13:48.653]  And that's happening right now.
[01:13:49.034 --> 01:13:49.855]  They can lie.
[01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:50.916]  They can blow stuff up.
[01:13:51.256 --> 01:13:52.518]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:13:52.538 --> 01:13:55.601]  They can kill certain people and try to scare everybody else.
[01:13:55.701 --> 01:13:56.542]  It isn't working.
[01:13:57.063 --> 01:14:02.149]  The human pattern of resisting extermination of the species has begun.
[01:14:02.829 --> 01:14:11.114]  Enough people realize that this is about exterminating us in mass, about re-engineering us as a servant class, a tiny 500 million servant class of the elite.
[01:14:11.454 --> 01:14:25.403]  Enough people realize that, and that psychology has begun, that war psychology for a real war, for a true war of liberty and humanity and renaissance and enlightenment has begun, and people are ready to throw themselves in front of tanks.
[01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:27.784]  It's not about defending your individual self anymore.
[01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:30.666]  It is about defending against dehumanization.
[01:14:30.826 --> 01:14:32.227]  It is about fighting the New World Order.
[01:14:32.247 --> 01:14:32.907]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:33.148 --> 01:14:33.468]  Thank you.
[01:14:33.648 --> 01:14:34.488]  Good to hear from you, Zach.
[01:14:34.508 --> 01:14:35.129]  Who's up next?
[01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:37.610]  Wyatt Marilyn.
[01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:38.051]  Go ahead.
[01:14:38.071 --> 01:14:38.651]  You're on the air.
[01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:39.892]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:14:39.912 --> 01:14:42.653]  It's been a long time since I called you.
[01:14:43.874 --> 01:14:47.176]  I was in a conversation with a co-worker of mine.
[01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:50.158]  His wife came to visit, and he's just recently been married.
[01:14:50.518 --> 01:14:54.921]  She's from Turkey, and I guess she's about
[01:14:56.789 --> 01:15:09.913]  36 and 38 and we were talking having discussion and conversation and she we were talking about 9-11 and she said oh we knew that this was an orchestrated event and we knew that
[01:15:12.918 --> 01:15:19.383]  Your President Bush probably had a lot to do with it, and a lot of this never happened, as it was said.
[01:15:19.403 --> 01:15:23.526]  And I was kind of shocked, because... Yeah, I was talking to a Russian businessman who owns a computer company.
[01:15:23.546 --> 01:15:24.667]  He said, oh, we all know that.
[01:15:24.707 --> 01:15:30.051]  He goes, we all know Putin's blowing the buildings up, even before he actually got caught doing it, over in Russia.
[01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:30.972]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:15:31.012 --> 01:15:38.998]  I mean, of course, the American public's not treated to any of this information from abroad, because they're so controlled the information that we get.
[01:15:39.608 --> 01:15:41.129]  But I thought this photo was very interesting.
[01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:57.857]  I had a chance to watch your Police State 3, and of course I thought it was very good, but there were two parts of the editing that I thought were extremely informative and had more of an effect on me watching your film than most of it.
[01:15:57.957 --> 01:15:59.458]  And one was very different.
[01:15:59.498 --> 01:16:02.539]  When you were on the street talking to the Gestapos
[01:16:04.662 --> 01:16:07.304]  Well, I was saying, you're violating state law.
[01:16:07.624 --> 01:16:08.445]  Where are your badges?
[01:16:20.183 --> 01:16:21.423]  And they just wouldn't respond.
[01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:22.584]  What was that?
[01:16:23.184 --> 01:16:23.584]  What was that?
[01:16:23.624 --> 01:16:24.304]  Why were they there?
[01:16:24.344 --> 01:16:25.685]  What was that whole situation?
[01:16:25.705 --> 01:16:27.065]  It was Marty Grubb.

[01:20:47.063 --> 01:20:52.264]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:53.685 --> 01:20:56.706]  Alright, let's start getting to these callers so I can get into some more of the news.
[01:20:57.446 --> 01:21:02.207]  Wyatt, Maryland, what other part of Police State 3 did you find extremely interesting?
[01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:12.630]  Well, I thought it was just the part towards the end of your movie, when you were at your home in a relaxed setting,
[01:21:13.334 --> 01:21:22.896]  And I thought that that was a very good way of making a point that we see newscasters behind desks all the time with backdrops.
[01:21:23.677 --> 01:21:33.719]  But when you personalized it like that, it had more of an appeal to me as a viewer than the typical behind-the-desk thing.
[01:21:33.739 --> 01:21:42.021]  Now, I know that it's difficult to get out, but amongst and do these, you have to be behind a desk in order to present a lot of information.
[01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:49.914]  But one of the most powerful videos that you made that I thought was extremely well, and you didn't do any of that, was when you did Bohemian Grove.
[01:21:50.455 --> 01:21:55.979]  I was more moved by that movie, that video, because it showed me, it gave me a lot of information.
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:09.831]  Where this took place, what it looks like, how it functions, and that was extremely informative to me, and it kind of, that movie really struck me because of the intensity
[01:22:10.798 --> 01:22:15.199]  Of the topic there and how true and how awful that was.
[01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:24.662]  That's why we show in the cab, getting on the plane, flying there, meeting the hotel, the planning, the infiltration, and of course the film starts with the history of the Grove first.
[01:22:25.102 --> 01:22:26.362]  That's why I did it that way.
[01:22:26.382 --> 01:22:30.763]  You know, it's an hour into the film before you see the second hour in the satanic ceremony.
[01:22:30.783 --> 01:22:31.003]  Right.
[01:22:31.303 --> 01:22:33.244]  But I couldn't just show somebody the satanic ceremony.
[01:22:33.264 --> 01:22:34.544]  They'd go, that's not a real place.
[01:22:34.744 --> 01:22:37.545]  I know, but I just thought it was very powerful for me.
[01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:38.145]  That was one of the
[01:22:39.083 --> 01:22:47.245]  When I finished watching that movie, I went, my God, this is unbelievable, and here I just witnessed this, and it was just very powerful, Alex, and it was great.
[01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:58.308]  One other topic, I'm sorry to get off of it, you know, remember the P-3 plane that was supposedly hit by a fighter pilot named Wang Wei in China?
[01:22:59.768 --> 01:23:00.568]  Do you remember that?
[01:23:00.588 --> 01:23:01.349]  The U.S.
[01:23:01.389 --> 01:23:02.649]  P-3 spy plane?
[01:23:02.829 --> 01:23:03.609]  The surveillance craft.
[01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:06.870]  The surveillance plane, and then it had to make an emergency landing?
[01:23:07.966 --> 01:23:11.503]  Uh, also the Chinese island and of course, China.
[01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:15.593]  That was done, I believe, that was a planned operation.
[01:23:15.633 --> 01:23:18.836]  That was all staged, and by the way, that's even come out.
[01:23:19.276 --> 01:23:28.504]  They had just told the Israelis, no, you can't transfer these high-tech AWACS to China, and Israel wasn't going to get the money.
[01:23:28.584 --> 01:23:33.008]  So America then gave Israel the money and said, sorry, you take the money, you don't have to sell it to them.
[01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.232]  Then a week later, this happens to this plane and they strip it,
[01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:51.565]  With even more high-tech stuff, and our government says, that's okay, and the troops on board, the pilots and the technicians, they didn't pour the acid in there, they didn't hit the buttons to destroy it, which they'd all be court-martialed!
[01:23:51.705 --> 01:23:52.806]  That's what we're supposed to do!
[01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:55.028]  And only 30 minutes when they were being brought down to do it!
[01:23:55.248 --> 01:23:56.970]  It's ridiculous, thanks for the call to the point.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:07.045]  Yeah, they got buttons they hit that pulls and dumps acid into all the electronics and all that classified stuff, and they'd shoot you if you got near one of those planes, folks.
[01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:09.586]  But no, the company is Chinese!
[01:24:09.646 --> 01:24:10.046]  Get it?
[01:24:10.927 --> 01:24:12.107]  Anthony in New Jersey.
[01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:12.988]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[01:24:13.008 --> 01:24:13.488]  Yes, Alex.
[01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:13.848]  Hello.
[01:24:14.248 --> 01:24:14.709]  How you doing?
[01:24:14.729 --> 01:24:19.271]  I've been wanting to report to you an incident here, but I'm calling from South Jersey, by the way.
[01:24:19.795 --> 01:24:24.538]  An incident by the state police, which resulted in murder.
[01:24:25.138 --> 01:24:26.499]  Your state police are real bad.
[01:24:26.679 --> 01:24:32.182]  Yeah, the state police here, in a little town called Belmar, they gave chase to a man in a stolen car.
[01:24:32.542 --> 01:24:35.383]  Well, during the chase, the car got stuck or stopped or something.
[01:24:35.824 --> 01:24:37.765]  And this guy took off and ran up into the woods.
[01:24:38.225 --> 01:24:41.807]  Well, listen, there's 37 shots were fired by these three policemen.
[01:24:42.227 --> 01:24:47.770]  Now, the paper didn't inquire, did not say how many shots went into the body.
[01:24:48.962 --> 01:24:52.064]  But can you imagine this over a stolen car?
[01:24:52.084 --> 01:24:54.005]  There's so many other ways they could have dealt with this.
[01:24:54.445 --> 01:24:56.706]  You know, grab the guy later or something like this.
[01:24:57.087 --> 01:24:58.447]  Well, they're not supposed to do that.
[01:24:58.648 --> 01:24:59.988]  They're not supposed to do that.
[01:25:00.549 --> 01:25:07.112]  Only a homeowner on their own property, whether it's a police officer or not, should be able to kill somebody for stealing.
[01:25:08.012 --> 01:25:10.194]  And that's the common law.
[01:25:10.794 --> 01:25:14.456]  But I know this, when my car was stolen in Dallas, the cops wouldn't even come out.
[01:25:15.369 --> 01:25:17.851]  And I got mad and hung up on 9-1-1 like a third call.
[01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:20.032]  Then they came out and got mad that I hung up.
[01:25:20.053 --> 01:25:22.995]  I mean, you hear these young kids, even when I was in high school.
[01:25:23.295 --> 01:25:26.457]  They'd take a car for a joyride or something, and there was nothing to it.
[01:25:26.577 --> 01:25:26.877]  You know?
[01:25:26.897 --> 01:25:28.939]  And the owner didn't do it.
[01:25:29.019 --> 01:25:29.719]  Well, it's bad.
[01:25:29.739 --> 01:25:33.942]  I mean, I think they should... And they actually make a murder over something over his car like this.
[01:25:34.022 --> 01:25:34.523]  It's awful.
[01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:35.783]  It's just awful.
[01:25:35.803 --> 01:25:36.424]  Well, let me just tell you.
[01:25:37.274 --> 01:25:41.635]  Usually it's government officials that run the chop shops, and it's usually the cops doing the main stealing of the cars.
[01:25:41.935 --> 01:25:43.396]  That was in the Washington Times.
[01:25:43.476 --> 01:25:51.178]  Washington, D.C., they pull up in uniform, get out of Wreckers and McDonald's, they'll steal 12 cars, people walk out, they'll pull guns on them, they openly run chop shops.
[01:25:51.198 --> 01:25:52.798]  That's the Washington Times, if you doubt me, folks.
[01:25:53.859 --> 01:25:56.099]  I'm not kidding, that sounds insane, but it's true.
[01:25:58.895 --> 01:25:59.396]  I mean, no.
[01:25:59.496 --> 01:26:02.458]  Certainly, if somebody steals a car, they should serve a few months hard labor.
[01:26:02.798 --> 01:26:04.319]  Second time, five years prison.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.721]  Third time, 20 years in prison.
[01:26:07.181 --> 01:26:09.223]  But, we need to punish stealing.
[01:26:09.843 --> 01:26:12.985]  They don't punish stealing, but then they shoot you when you run away.
[01:26:14.046 --> 01:26:16.068]  Yeah, New Jersey police are something else, Anthony.
[01:26:17.727 --> 01:26:20.149]  Let me mention one quick other point if you don't mind, Alex.
[01:26:20.449 --> 01:26:20.669]  Okay.
[01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:25.352]  If our country should go to war with North Korea, whose side would the Red Chinese be on?
[01:26:25.593 --> 01:26:26.934]  You know they'll be on North Korea's.
[01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:28.575]  Oh, just like before.
[01:26:29.095 --> 01:26:29.875]  Just like before.
[01:26:29.896 --> 01:26:30.456]  We'll be back.
[01:26:32.637 --> 01:26:33.538]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.018 --> 01:26:35.639]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.603 --> 01:26:47.247]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the ARC Institute.
[01:26:47.347 --> 01:26:53.452]  You'll get 25 big packets of ARC's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular... At 888-803-4438.
[01:26:53.672 --> 01:26:54.653]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:55.514]  That's toll-free, triple-8, 803-4438.
[01:27:06.366 --> 01:27:12.408]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:27:13.028 --> 01:27:15.989]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:24.192]  All right, let's go back to some more calls real quick, then I'm going to dive back into some of the news we haven't gotten to yet that's very, very important.
[01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:28.834]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Warren in Colorado.
[01:27:28.874 --> 01:27:30.414]  Warren, you're on the air.
[01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:30.874]  Go ahead.
[01:27:30.894 --> 01:27:32.995]  Hi Alex.
[01:27:33.835 --> 01:27:35.596]  I was wondering if I could get your opinion
[01:27:37.071 --> 01:27:38.873]  And an answer about talk shows.
[01:27:40.114 --> 01:27:49.881]  Here in Denver we have two talk show stations and once in a while you go on the air at midnight with Rick Barber.
[01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:51.302]  Yeah, he's a good guy.
[01:27:51.482 --> 01:27:55.105]  Oh yeah, he's probably the most intelligent guy of that whole group.
[01:27:56.085 --> 01:28:01.009]  But you can tell how controlled these talk shows are because in the afternoons
[01:28:02.105 --> 01:28:08.388]  If they ask a serious type question, they'll only take about two or three callers, and then they change it up to a less serious topic.
[01:28:09.749 --> 01:28:24.095]  And so my question is, how is it that, you know, you can go on the air, and you can talk about serious, real issues, and then during the day, they shut them off completely, when they're owned by the same company, which is JCOR?
[01:28:26.997 --> 01:28:29.018]  Well, are you saying that
[01:28:30.655 --> 01:28:37.384]  I believe that particular station is Clear Channel.
[01:28:37.404 --> 01:28:40.849]  I don't get to go on a lot of Clear Channel stations.
[01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:44.354]  Program directors will say no talk against Bush, no talk
[01:28:45.407 --> 01:28:46.668]  About how they're neocons.
[01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:51.993]  They'll have a dumb liberal on who goes, I'm a communist, I love communism, Bush is bad.
[01:28:52.574 --> 01:28:53.915]  Well then that makes Bush sound good.
[01:28:53.935 --> 01:28:59.300]  They don't want a real conservative going, Bush is for gun control, open borders, selling out our sovereignty.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:00.320]  They don't want that.
[01:29:00.341 --> 01:29:02.462]  They want to get the fake left-right debate going.
[01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:10.790]  Someone like Rick Barber is kind of grandfathered in because he has great listenership overnight.
[01:29:11.993 --> 01:29:16.054]  Uh, and, you know, that's why a Clear Channel Station doesn't put their own product, Art Bell, on.
[01:29:16.094 --> 01:29:18.434]  They put Rick Barber on because he gets higher ratings.
[01:29:18.874 --> 01:29:19.154]  I think.
[01:29:19.634 --> 01:29:24.075]  For, uh, you know, the new guy they've got in there doing the overnight shows.
[01:29:24.455 --> 01:29:24.735]  Okay.
[01:29:25.015 --> 01:29:34.077]  And so there's, you know, there are some mom-and-pop Big 50,000 Waters that have a similar conspiracy theory tent-type show overnight.
[01:29:34.937 --> 01:29:36.357]  And I've been on most of those.
[01:29:36.597 --> 01:29:40.858]  And I've been on a lot of morning rock shows because the Globalist didn't see that as a threat.
[01:29:41.531 --> 01:29:50.459]  And didn't think to stifle that and haven't had consultants in there telling the neocon talk show host what to do.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:56.765]  But they do have consultants, and we've listed some of their names, I've gone over it in the past, who really are government agents.
[01:29:56.805 --> 01:30:03.731]  I mean, they really have a handful of top consultants who really are Department of Defense officers, Operation Mockingbird,
[01:30:04.344 --> 01:30:12.386]  And they go around and tell people what to report, what to do, how to frame things, and if you play off the script good enough, you get advanced.
[01:30:12.946 --> 01:30:16.887]  If you don't, you get put on in the middle of the night, or they just phase you out, period.
[01:30:17.887 --> 01:30:25.808]  They like to have a few stations that still, every once in a while, tell the truth in a weird time slot, so they can claim, oh look, we've got diversity.
[01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:33.250]  But mainly, it's the deadly poison of the neocon, as Ron Paul said, that is pushed.
[01:30:34.051 --> 01:30:42.173]  Okay, which kind of leads into the Denver Post article on Sunday, which says that migrant smugglers traffic in terror, federal officials say.
[01:30:42.793 --> 01:30:44.494]  And this is quite a powerful article.
[01:30:45.494 --> 01:30:49.935]  But what's so dumb about it, so obvious, that's the question I had when 9-11 hit.
[01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:55.217]  And now they're just trying, now they're just starting to investigate whether terrorists have come across the border.
[01:30:55.377 --> 01:30:56.657]  Well, of course, they know that
[01:30:58.991 --> 01:31:02.973]  Eighty-plus percent of the American people, including Hispanics, want the borders shut and illegals deported.
[01:31:03.493 --> 01:31:05.013]  So they tried to make it a racial issue.
[01:31:05.113 --> 01:31:06.494]  Oh, it's racist to control the border.
[01:31:06.554 --> 01:31:07.314]  No, it's common sense.
[01:31:07.694 --> 01:31:08.935]  Mexico controls their border.
[01:31:09.915 --> 01:31:10.835]  So does Germany.
[01:31:10.895 --> 01:31:12.776]  So does any other country.
[01:31:12.816 --> 01:31:14.957]  So does France.
[01:31:15.497 --> 01:31:17.458]  You've got to control your border to have a country.
[01:31:18.198 --> 01:31:21.139]  And so there's such a backlash now, they'll talk about it.
[01:31:21.819 --> 01:31:24.741]  Because they know they've got to address it or lose all credibility.
[01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:25.881]  They came out and said, yeah,
[01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:29.052]  The HB1 visas are taking all your jobs.
[01:31:29.092 --> 01:31:31.053]  It's going to get seven times worse.
[01:31:32.274 --> 01:31:36.477]  Yeah, you know, it is bad to have an open border, but so what?
[01:31:37.718 --> 01:31:46.384]  We're going to, you know, 800 plus cities and now all these states and the feds are going to accept these matricula cards from Poland and Mexico and all, you know, and Venezuela.
[01:31:47.025 --> 01:31:51.128]  I mean, it just, it just, any fake ID is okay unless you're a citizen.
[01:31:51.488 --> 01:31:55.231]  You've got to have a whole lot of IDs and biometrically scanned.
[01:31:57.253 --> 01:32:05.716]  Yeah, so if you would have brought this subject up in front of these other talk show hosts during the day, they would have, you know, pretty much shut you off.
[01:32:06.056 --> 01:32:07.036]  Well, I won't even do that.
[01:32:07.136 --> 01:32:09.317]  You know, the call screen will say, what's your topic?
[01:32:09.797 --> 01:32:11.737]  Well, what they're talking about, you know, the terrorism.
[01:32:11.757 --> 01:32:12.698]  What do you want to talk about?
[01:32:12.738 --> 01:32:15.378]  Well, how we're leaving our border open, but having to give up our liberties.
[01:32:15.398 --> 01:32:16.699]  You know, what are all the cameras for?
[01:32:16.999 --> 01:32:17.939]  Why aren't they on the border?
[01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:20.720]  You know, I don't like Bush for the assault weapons ban.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.940]  You know, I want real conservatism.
[01:32:22.341 --> 01:32:23.801]  Sorry, I can't take your call.
[01:32:23.861 --> 01:32:24.121]  Why?
[01:32:24.421 --> 01:32:25.822]  Well, you just don't fit in right now.
[01:32:25.862 --> 01:32:26.842]  We're moving on in the topic.
[01:32:27.382 --> 01:32:30.606]  But you hear somebody going, I just am sick of the commies.
[01:32:31.007 --> 01:32:35.512]  I just love George W. They'll be right on the air for five minutes.
[01:32:36.173 --> 01:32:37.795]  Thank you, Billy Bob, for your call.
[01:32:38.435 --> 01:32:42.961]  Or some idiot socialist calls in and he goes, I believe we should take all private property.
[01:32:43.121 --> 01:32:43.802]  I hate Bush.
[01:32:44.202 --> 01:32:45.862]  Look how crazy you liberals sound.
[01:32:46.182 --> 01:32:47.863]  Take on private property, they're crazy.
[01:32:48.123 --> 01:32:49.503]  That's why I'm a Republican, folks.
[01:32:49.543 --> 01:32:50.763]  Listen to these left-wing kooks.
[01:32:51.003 --> 01:32:53.244]  No, you're the left-wing kook, you neocon.
[01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:58.585]  You're just a sneaky, sophisticated one, owned by the corporate media, trying to deep-six this country.
[01:32:59.765 --> 01:33:00.725]  Yeah.
[01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:11.688]  That article you had on your website with those four women that were kind of marching on Washington, D.C., that's quite a powerful article.
[01:33:11.728 --> 01:33:13.468]  The New York Observer, it's their second article.
[01:33:15.074 --> 01:33:18.195]  About prior knowledge and the government carrying out September 11th, yeah.
[01:33:18.455 --> 01:33:19.155]  That's incredible.
[01:33:19.255 --> 01:33:20.095]  Okay, thanks, Guy.
[01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:21.135]  Thank you.
[01:33:21.155 --> 01:33:25.416]  There was a Philadelphia Daily News article that had 20 unanswered questions.
[01:33:27.617 --> 01:33:31.837]  That's in the archives at presentplanet.com and infowars.com from what, last September 11th.
[01:33:32.298 --> 01:33:32.838]  Last week.
[01:33:32.858 --> 01:33:34.558]  You ought to go click on it and read it in the archives.
[01:33:35.758 --> 01:33:36.218]  I mean, yeah.
[01:33:36.258 --> 01:33:37.559]  I mean, it's coming out, folks.
[01:33:37.659 --> 01:33:39.799]  I mean, more and more people know the truth.
[01:33:39.899 --> 01:33:41.899]  And so the feds can blow up whatever they want.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.380]  People are going to know the truth.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.360]  It isn't going to work for them.
[01:33:45.973 --> 01:33:46.613]  It's a big deal.
[01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:47.954]  We're actually winning.
[01:33:49.175 --> 01:33:50.616]  So they can release smallpox.
[01:33:51.177 --> 01:33:52.297]  It's gonna blow up in their face.
[01:33:54.078 --> 01:33:55.700]  They can nuke something.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.963]  And they may just hope that their police and military are so brainwashed they follow orders.
[01:34:01.744 --> 01:34:02.764]  I don't see that happening.
[01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:06.447]  I see us... We're on the razor's edge right now.
[01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.828]  I mean, we got psychopaths running things, folks.
[01:34:08.888 --> 01:34:09.989]  And they're not getting any younger.
[01:34:10.009 --> 01:34:11.930]  They want power and control now.
[01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:14.032]  All the old Alexander...
[01:34:15.018 --> 01:34:20.260]  I just want to tell you, Alex, I'm still making copies, and they're going to be showing
[01:34:43.792 --> 01:34:59.964]  I think Harry over here at the WBCR, you say Knoxville, but actually it's in Blount County, at Heritage High School this Saturday at the 9-1-1, and I just wanted to let everybody know that.
[01:34:59.984 --> 01:35:01.865]  They may be listening in the area, too.
[01:35:01.885 --> 01:35:04.547]  Go up there and watch that.
[01:35:04.607 --> 01:35:07.409]  Of course, I've watched it two or three times before, maybe.
[01:35:10.222 --> 01:35:15.104]  Well, that's exciting, and we really appreciate WBCR there.
[01:35:15.824 --> 01:35:18.105]  Long-serving affiliate doing a great job.
[01:35:18.325 --> 01:35:20.346]  Yeah.
[01:35:20.786 --> 01:35:23.947]  Anyway, I had something kind of funny happen to me.
[01:35:23.987 --> 01:35:26.168]  The guy earlier was talking about masons, you know.
[01:35:27.468 --> 01:35:30.630]  Back in the 70s, I was pretty ignorant back then.
[01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:37.332]  I bought a license plate that had the Masonic symbol on the front.
[01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:51.449]  I thought that was pretty cool because it had my first initial on it and I had it on there.
[01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:54.912]  I was ignorant back then.
[01:35:55.693 --> 01:36:01.078]  This guy approached me about it and said, are you a Mason?
[01:36:03.536 --> 01:36:09.880]  Well yeah I am, because I thought he was talking about doing masonry work, you know, because I did.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.702]  He bought a car with a Masonic license plate, he said, are you a mason, what happened next?
[01:36:14.983 --> 01:36:22.707]  And he kind of threatened me, he said, you better take that thing off your car, because
[01:36:24.605 --> 01:36:26.525]  A lot of trouble over that, you know.
[01:36:26.585 --> 01:36:28.926]  They kind of started threatening me about it, you know.
[01:36:29.086 --> 01:36:32.847]  Oh, because you didn't know the secret handshake when he asked you.
[01:36:32.967 --> 01:36:33.307]  Right.
[01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:35.087]  I didn't know what it was.
[01:36:35.627 --> 01:36:39.988]  It just kind of shook me up a little bit.
[01:36:40.008 --> 01:36:42.948]  They were kind of threatening me because I had that on my car.
[01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:46.749]  And, of course, I did take it off.
[01:36:48.049 --> 01:36:49.750]  And back in 1989, one of my
[01:36:51.465 --> 01:36:52.085]  Absolutely.
[01:36:52.126 --> 01:36:54.307]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[01:36:54.327 --> 01:36:58.791]  Appreciate it there in Tennessee.
[01:37:14.813 --> 01:37:16.333]  Let me just say this about the Masons.
[01:37:16.393 --> 01:37:18.094]  Again, most Masons aren't bad.
[01:37:18.254 --> 01:37:20.054]  It's like any other big organization.
[01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:21.255]  It's the top that's corrupt.
[01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:22.235]  And it is, folks.
[01:37:22.315 --> 01:37:23.055]  And it is a cult.
[01:37:24.016 --> 01:37:24.356]  Okay?
[01:37:24.856 --> 01:37:26.056]  It's in published books.
[01:37:26.256 --> 01:37:27.076]  Morals and Dogma.
[01:37:27.156 --> 01:37:27.737]  Albert Pike.
[01:37:27.797 --> 01:37:28.597]  Grand Mason.
[01:37:28.617 --> 01:37:29.977]  And he'll tell you.
[01:37:30.017 --> 01:37:30.617]  It's the occult.
[01:37:30.737 --> 01:37:31.778]  He worships Lucifer.
[01:37:32.498 --> 01:37:34.018]  Lucifer isn't Jesus, folks.
[01:37:34.398 --> 01:37:35.939]  They say Lucifer is Jesus.
[01:37:36.079 --> 01:37:37.519]  Or Jesus' brother.
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:41.080]  And it's really scary stuff.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.961]  And there is a retired police officer.
[01:37:46.767 --> 01:37:50.309]  I've been friends with for years who did some work on my house.
[01:37:50.349 --> 01:37:55.552]  He's an older guy, but he does carpentry work.
[01:37:55.632 --> 01:37:58.694]  He did some work on my house, put in a pergola floor.
[01:37:58.714 --> 01:38:05.478]  They told me a story about how his dad was a mason in his hometown, and so it came time for him to be a mason.
[01:38:09.449 --> 01:38:12.330]  He had this business and man, things were going really, really well.
[01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.910]  It was a print shop before he went into being a police officer.
[01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:16.410]  He was like 20-something right out of the military.
[01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:20.011]  And when, uh, well actually he said, join.
[01:38:20.031 --> 01:38:23.852]  And he said, okay, went down and they did the weird stuff and the white robes and all this initiated him.
[01:38:23.872 --> 01:38:25.972]  He said, you know, I'm too busy for this.
[01:38:25.992 --> 01:38:26.412]  And this is it.
[01:38:26.512 --> 01:38:27.472]  He just got a weird feeling.
[01:38:27.492 --> 01:38:28.552]  He said, I'm not going to join.
[01:38:29.333 --> 01:38:29.933]  I'm getting out.
[01:38:31.273 --> 01:38:34.273]  And he said his business disappeared.
[01:38:35.514 --> 01:38:37.414]  Started getting harassed by police, other stuff.
[01:38:38.534 --> 01:38:41.075]  And so, I mean, you know, this is serious business, folks.
[01:38:41.135 --> 01:38:52.280]  When my great-great-uncle, who I barely got to meet, he died when I was about four years old, Uncle Houston ran bars for the Mafia during Prohibition.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:58.122]  He ran away when he was 13, got on board ships, steam ships, sailed the world.
[01:38:58.142 --> 01:38:59.023]  I mean, incredible life.
[01:39:00.463 --> 01:39:04.245]  Came back, owned bars, you know, worked in a bar, owned a bar.
[01:39:04.285 --> 01:39:06.086]  Then Prohibition came in and he
[01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:16.972]  He was involved in that and running a bunch of bars in Houston for the German mafia that ran the liquor stuff for Al Capone in this area.
[01:39:17.953 --> 01:39:21.534]  The Italian mob out of Chicago controlled the German mob down here in Texas.
[01:39:22.394 --> 01:39:24.394]  A lot of the fortunes here in Austin were made out of that.
[01:39:25.055 --> 01:39:36.878]  But to make a long story short, my Uncle Houston, who retired after he had a bunch of heart attacks when he was like 65, moved back to the farm in East Texas, into the old house next door to where my dad was growing up.
[01:39:38.064 --> 01:39:40.507]  He was a Mason, and he's one of the ones that told my dad not to join it.
[01:39:41.027 --> 01:39:45.652]  He was a 33rd degree, and at one time somebody tried to come in, and they had a gunfight.
[01:39:45.792 --> 01:39:50.516]  Another gang tried to take a bunch of money he was collecting, and he shot and killed a couple people.
[01:39:50.536 --> 01:39:54.680]  I mean, they had gunfights in those days, still.
[01:39:55.461 --> 01:40:00.326]  And, uh, he went in to the judge, flashed Mason in distress, man, case is miss wham.
[01:40:01.364 --> 01:40:04.505]  Now, folks, that's not right, okay?
[01:40:04.625 --> 01:40:06.726]  And that's a title of nobility.
[01:40:06.766 --> 01:40:08.467]  That's a special class system.
[01:40:08.987 --> 01:40:09.767]  And that is going on.
[01:40:09.807 --> 01:40:10.748]  I don't care what you say.
[01:40:11.308 --> 01:40:16.110]  They knock the ring on the table, they do their little mason in distress sign, and they walk.
[01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:23.192]  Alright, coming up, I want to get more into somebody committing suicide at a rock concert and how great and loving they say it is.
[01:40:24.133 --> 01:40:30.315]  I want to get into more developments on RFID, Ashcroft, and the Patriot Act and trouble.
[01:40:31.115 --> 01:40:32.956]  Miami Police on orange alert.
[01:40:33.336 --> 01:40:35.837]  West Nile, 35,000 potential cases.
[01:40:35.897 --> 01:40:39.438]  Rocky Mountain News reporting there in Colorado.
[01:40:41.479 --> 01:40:42.680]  And just a bunch of other news.
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.741]  Some new news on vaccinations and autism.
[01:40:44.761 --> 01:40:46.661]  We're going to get to it all, so stay with us.
[01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:51.143]  Plus, a bad review from USA Today of the new show, Threat Matrix.
[01:40:51.823 --> 01:40:57.846]  Before I end this segment, I want to bring Debbie from New Millennium Concepts up, who I appreciate patiently holding the last 10 minutes.
[01:40:59.325 --> 01:41:08.348]  Because she's a great lady, and this is who you talk to when you cease to drink the poison that's in the water and start protecting your family at New Millennium Concepts.
[01:41:09.049 --> 01:41:11.169]  And Debbie, good to have you on the show with us.
[01:41:11.729 --> 01:41:12.270]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:13.470]  How are you doing?
[01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:17.271]  I'm doing great, and we appreciate your fine work and the great service you provide.
[01:41:17.792 --> 01:41:18.692]  Oh, thank you.
[01:41:19.392 --> 01:41:23.194]  I'm very excited with the new announcement today.
[01:41:25.672 --> 01:41:31.776]  I'm sure most of your listeners know that you've had your Alex Jones September special.
[01:41:32.537 --> 01:41:35.859]  We've got a banner for that on the left-hand side of Infowars.com.
[01:41:36.319 --> 01:41:38.060]  You save hundreds of dollars on there.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:38.841]  Go look at it.
[01:41:39.221 --> 01:41:39.681]  Compare it.
[01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:40.542]  It is a great deal.
[01:41:40.562 --> 01:41:42.043]  Infowars.com.
[01:41:42.063 --> 01:41:42.343]  Go ahead.
[01:41:47.833 --> 01:42:02.025]  Looking towards having the fluoride reduction filter to go onto the black purification filters to reduce the fluoride from your water and we now have them available.
[01:42:02.725 --> 01:42:09.271]  So we're going to add them onto your special for, you know, the next couple of days.
[01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:10.281]  I think so.
[01:42:33.371 --> 01:42:36.973]  99% of the filters you see at stores or you buy, don't cut fluoride out.
[01:42:37.593 --> 01:42:38.493]  That's correct.
[01:42:38.993 --> 01:42:43.515]  As a toxic chemical weapon, they chose it because it goes through almost everything.
[01:42:43.595 --> 01:42:47.517]  I mean, it took you guys years to get this down and get this designed.
[01:42:47.817 --> 01:42:48.937]  This is a post-filter.
[01:42:49.277 --> 01:42:50.838]  So you want clean water, folks.
[01:42:51.018 --> 01:42:51.758]  This is it.
[01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:52.358]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[01:42:52.638 --> 01:42:56.680]  Well, you know what's amazing is I have a brother-in-law who's an oral surgeon.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.802]  And, you know, I talked to him about fluoride reduction and he absolutely hasn't got a clue.
[01:43:02.608 --> 01:43:16.617]  You know I mean people are so brainwashed into thinking fluoride is good for you and yet if you get online and get on the internet and read about fluoride and read about you know where it came from and how they've promoted it.
[01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:19.139]  My father's a dentist and an oral surgeon.
[01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:20.960]  He finally went and read
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:30.767]  You know, the head dentist, and he's got all these other PhDs and degrees, who was for fluoridation, is now against it in Canada, said I was wrong.
[01:43:31.167 --> 01:43:37.472]  We have this top chemist on, who testifies for the FDA.
[01:43:37.512 --> 01:43:38.713]  It's not just fluoride, folks.
[01:43:38.994 --> 01:43:42.917]  They add toxic waste to it from the aluminum plants
[01:43:43.577 --> 01:43:44.898]  And the fertilizer plants.
[01:43:44.938 --> 01:43:46.579]  They're putting toxic waste in the water.
[01:43:46.839 --> 01:43:48.000]  It's like depleted uranium.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.420]  How do they get rid of toxic waste?
[01:43:49.761 --> 01:43:51.922]  They shoot it into the water, into the atmosphere.
[01:43:52.882 --> 01:43:53.623]  It's crazy.
[01:43:53.643 --> 01:43:54.923]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[01:43:54.944 --> 01:43:55.344]  You're right.
[01:43:56.244 --> 01:43:56.504]  I know.
[01:43:56.745 --> 01:43:58.125]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:43:58.145 --> 01:44:06.470]  There's so many things added in the water, and we're really so excited about the black purification elements in the big, in the berkelies.
[01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:15.197]  And we want to get them out to the public, because it's really our heart to make sure that everybody in America has good drinking water.
[01:44:15.217 --> 01:44:19.441]  Hey, and the products are top of the line, and you guys are the biggest sponsors of this show.
[01:44:20.559 --> 01:44:22.200]  Well, we try to.
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:28.803]  We want to be good sponsors for you, and we really want to support your programming, Alex, and keep you on the air.
[01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:35.885]  Well, it's important, and you guys help with the international outreach with the shortwave, which reaches millions of people globally, and it's a great product.
[01:44:35.905 --> 01:44:36.626]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:44:36.686 --> 01:44:36.966]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:44:36.986 --> 01:44:39.667]  And you'll talk to Debbie when you call, so don't call right now.
[01:44:50.214 --> 01:44:54.781]  Just Debbie and one other nice lady, and this is how they keep the prices down.
[01:44:55.783 --> 01:44:56.324]  Hold on, Debbie.
[01:44:56.344 --> 01:44:59.629]  I want to hold you over and talk a little bit more about this, and I'll get into some other news and end this hour.
[01:45:00.069 --> 01:45:00.831]  But stay with us.
[01:45:00.951 --> 01:45:01.592]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:03.749 --> 01:45:05.710]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:16.514]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:45:16.874 --> 01:45:21.416]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:45:21.476 --> 01:45:32.800]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:40.250]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:45:40.651 --> 01:45:42.774]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:45:43.275 --> 01:45:48.242]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:54.847]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:45:54.928 --> 01:45:59.111]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:45:59.331 --> 01:46:00.092]  That's toll free.
[01:46:00.112 --> 01:46:00.152]  888-803-4438.
[01:46:05.074 --> 01:46:08.975]  Have you found your business isn't quite as profitable as it was before the economy went south?
[01:46:09.416 --> 01:46:11.456]  Are new clients a little harder to come by lately?
[01:46:11.476 --> 01:46:12.917]  Well, maybe we can help.
[01:46:13.437 --> 01:46:20.740]  Advertise your business on the GCN Radio Network and you'll soon find out why companies all across the country are experiencing a steady flow of new customers.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.941]  It's not by coincidence, it's by design.
[01:46:23.401 --> 01:46:28.703]  At GCN, we can increase your business with an ad package that's built specifically for your particular product or service.
[01:46:29.103 --> 01:46:32.084]  Join the many satisfied advertisers on the GCN Radio Network
[01:46:32.284 --> 01:46:34.586]  Who found out that the economy isn't so bad after all?
[01:46:34.906 --> 01:46:41.271]  Call toll-free 877-996-4327 extension 106 for quotes or more information.
[01:46:41.591 --> 01:46:45.914]  That number again is 877-996-4327 extension 106.
[01:46:46.635 --> 01:46:47.755]  Everyone listens to radio.
[01:46:48.116 --> 01:46:50.598]  It's the most cost-effective way to increase business available.
[01:46:50.958 --> 01:46:52.879]  Don't wait around hoping for a stronger economy.
[01:46:53.079 --> 01:46:56.162]  The country might be slipping into recession, but your business doesn't have to.
[01:46:56.562 --> 01:46:58.944]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[01:47:03.098 --> 01:47:07.461]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:07.642 --> 01:47:12.045]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:12.205 --> 01:47:16.589]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:17.970]  The New World Order.
[01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:23.993]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:24.053 --> 01:47:30.978]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:31.098 --> 01:47:33.140]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:43.828]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:44.128 --> 01:47:46.070]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:48.431]  Alright, Alex Jones here back live talking about
[01:48:16.477 --> 01:48:17.577]  Protecting yourselves.
[01:48:19.598 --> 01:48:26.060]  The body is 70% water and I'm sorry it's true they're poisoning us in a premeditated fashion to the water.
[01:48:27.161 --> 01:48:29.121]  It destroys IQs in children.
[01:48:29.321 --> 01:48:31.802]  It causes all different sorts of health problems.
[01:48:33.423 --> 01:48:36.344]  It is something to cloud the minds of the American people.
[01:48:38.732 --> 01:48:40.677]  And this is a scientific fact, folks.
[01:48:41.178 --> 01:48:48.555]  These people are a bunch of feudal lords, and the feudal lord's pleasure is dumbing down and starving their serfs.
[01:48:49.608 --> 01:48:50.509]  As a mode of control.
[01:48:51.029 --> 01:48:56.292]  Debbie, a lot of people have the British Barkfeld stainless steel models from you guys that are great as well.
[01:48:57.053 --> 01:49:00.735]  And they've got the older filters that cut out tons of stuff, but not everything.
[01:49:01.095 --> 01:49:05.157]  The new black filter, again, cuts everything out, folks.
[01:49:05.878 --> 01:49:09.300]  With the post filter added to it to get the fluoride, lead, and arsenic.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:16.344]  How do people get their old white filters replaced with the more powerful black filters?
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.681]  Well, Alex, we have sets available.
[01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.301]  They do fit the same.
[01:49:22.341 --> 01:49:28.862]  You can get the new purification elements and put them into your stainless steel canister.
[01:49:28.882 --> 01:49:34.203]  And you can actually get two of them or four.
[01:49:34.303 --> 01:49:37.444]  We have many customers who only use two filters at a time.
[01:49:38.024 --> 01:49:41.965]  Some people use four filters because they want to get water faster.
[01:49:41.985 --> 01:49:44.706]  It doesn't affect how pure the water is.
[01:49:44.786 --> 01:49:46.586]  It just affects how quickly you get it.
[01:49:47.455 --> 01:50:05.259]  So people can call me and order the Turification Elements and we will discount those too because I've had lots of customers call me up and they say, well, Debbie, you know, you're always offering all these specials for the new ones, but what about us customers who already have a stainless steel Big Berkey?
[01:50:05.619 --> 01:50:07.660]  We sure would like to get in on a deal too.
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.881]  So what we did was we worked up a special for $192.
[01:50:13.519 --> 01:50:19.487]  You get the four black Berkey elements plus one filtered sport bottle.
[01:50:20.368 --> 01:50:25.895]  And if you'd like to add the PF2 fluoride reduction filters along with it, it would just be another $35.
[01:50:26.535 --> 01:50:29.419]  So you could in fact save $53 by getting the set.
[01:50:32.171 --> 01:50:39.156]  And you know, that way they can update their system because the filters... Or if folks just want two of the black filters, they can do that too.
[01:50:39.376 --> 01:50:40.197]  Yes, they can.
[01:50:40.317 --> 01:50:42.639]  Because that'll do what, 30 gallons a day or something?
[01:50:43.159 --> 01:50:47.642]  Actually, you know, it kind of depends on the head pressure.
[01:50:47.682 --> 01:50:52.846]  I've had a lot of customers actually ask me about that, Alex, about the 30 gallons a day.
[01:50:53.704 --> 01:50:59.325]  And they have to realize that if they were doing 30 gallons a day, they would need to keep it full at all times.
[01:50:59.346 --> 01:51:02.186]  Yeah, that means if you keep filling it up... Right, exactly.
[01:51:02.246 --> 01:51:06.447]  And so if they did do four filters, it would give them water faster.
[01:51:06.467 --> 01:51:07.188]  It sure would.
[01:51:07.468 --> 01:51:07.808]  All right.
[01:51:07.848 --> 01:51:09.828]  Well, again, folks, right now, Debbie's there.
[01:51:09.848 --> 01:51:09.888]  888-803-4438.
[01:51:10.228 --> 01:51:11.649]  She'll be there tonight, too.
[01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.729]  888-803-4438.
[01:51:11.809 --> 01:51:13.169]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:51:13.309 --> 01:51:14.429]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:51:21.252 --> 01:51:21.693]  You bet.
[01:51:21.813 --> 01:51:22.313]  All right, folks.
[01:51:22.353 --> 01:51:24.275]  We're about to start the third hour.
[01:51:24.315 --> 01:51:25.557]  We're going to get to more of your calls.
[01:51:25.597 --> 01:51:29.621]  For those of you that have been patiently holding, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:51:29.921 --> 01:51:38.950]  West Nile Cases Projections Based on Infections of Colorado Blood Donors.
[01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:40.252]  This is out of the Rocky Mountain News.
[01:51:40.332 --> 01:51:41.233]  I thought I'd repeat this.
[01:51:42.287 --> 01:51:43.227]  I remember this a few days ago.
[01:51:43.727 --> 01:51:50.670]  More than 150 Colorado blood donors, and it's now up to like 301 county, initially tested positive for West Niles.
[01:51:50.690 --> 01:51:51.590]  The numbers have gotten worse.
[01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:57.532]  An indication that more than 35,000 people statewide might be infected with the mosquito-borne virus.
[01:51:57.552 --> 01:52:00.973]  So they do a test of just blood donors, and it's a massive percentage.
[01:52:01.753 --> 01:52:04.414]  And there's a lot of folks dying now all over the country.
[01:52:04.434 --> 01:52:06.975]  It just gets worse and worse every year.
[01:52:07.995 --> 01:52:10.496]  And I'll get more into this right when we start the next hour.
[01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:15.973]  It affects everybody from New York to Colorado.
[01:52:16.633 --> 01:52:21.075]  They say in another year or two it's going to be in California and in Washington State.
[01:52:21.095 --> 01:52:24.718]  I mean, this is serious, serious business.
[01:52:25.098 --> 01:52:28.780]  And frankly, folks, I've been seeing a lot of dead birds around Austin.
[01:52:30.181 --> 01:52:32.082]  We've had a bunch of West Nile cases here.
[01:52:33.923 --> 01:52:35.824]  You know, if you're young and healthy, it's not that bad.
[01:52:35.864 --> 01:52:36.164]  But if you're 65, 70,
[01:52:38.636 --> 01:52:39.756]  This stuff will kill you!
[01:52:39.776 --> 01:52:40.736]  It'll kill babies!
[01:52:40.796 --> 01:52:47.398]  It's just, uh... And of course, Donald Rumsfeld helped transfer that in 1983 to Saddam Hussein.
[01:52:47.438 --> 01:52:48.958]  That's the Senate Report, 1994.
[01:52:50.338 --> 01:52:51.158]  Third hour, coming up.
[01:52:51.178 --> 01:52:51.639]  We'll be back.
[01:52:53.839 --> 01:52:55.799]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:52:55.879 --> 01:52:56.539]  Hello, folks.
[01:52:56.659 --> 01:53:04.721]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Blocky Lights.
[01:53:08.712 --> 01:53:11.953]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.556 --> 01:53:20.217]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.877 --> 01:53:21.957]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.638 --> 01:53:23.798]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.818 --> 01:53:25.259]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.979 --> 01:53:26.859]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.879 --> 01:53:31.221]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.721 --> 01:53:35.823]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.851 --> 01:53:51.479]  A lot of people are calling me up and asking me what I think of Dean, what I think of Wesley Clark, what do I think of all these individuals, well I think they're all a bunch of New World Order garbage.
[01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:53.800]  That's what I know, I don't think it.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:58.803]  They control the system, the elite does, by controlling who they put out there for you to vote.
[01:53:59.463 --> 01:54:06.467]  Whether it's Dean, or Kerry, or George Bush, or Wesley Clark, you get globalism, you get open borders, you get gun control.
[01:54:07.210 --> 01:54:11.834]  It's just different rhetoric attached to each of the different individuals.
[01:54:11.874 --> 01:54:15.518]  Well, the hurricane's starting to hit the East Coast and has diminished some of its speed.
[01:54:15.538 --> 01:54:16.639]  We'll get into some more on that.
[01:54:17.179 --> 01:54:23.885]  What's gaining speed is West Nile in Colorado with a potential for 35,000 cases of that.
[01:54:23.925 --> 01:54:29.150]  According to people that went in to give blood, they tested them and found that a high level of the donors had it.
[01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:32.453]  And by calculating that out, they said as much as 35,000 people could have it.
[01:54:34.412 --> 01:54:42.057]  Extrapolated to Colorado's population of 4.3 million, that means that 35,000 people statewide, it may have been, have the virus in their bodies.
[01:54:42.737 --> 01:54:43.998]  Not all of them get sick.
[01:54:44.639 --> 01:54:49.602]  An estimated 70 to 80 percent of the infected people do not display any symptoms, health officials said.
[01:54:49.642 --> 01:54:50.662]  That's the Rocky Mountain News.
[01:54:51.963 --> 01:54:54.245]  It's a real problem because it gets worse every year.
[01:54:54.305 --> 01:54:56.586]  It builds up every summer.
[01:54:57.407 --> 01:55:00.729]  And in the next couple years, again, it could be as far away as
[01:55:01.565 --> 01:55:02.666]  Washington State.
[01:55:03.027 --> 01:55:04.348]  It's already out in Colorado.
[01:55:05.089 --> 01:55:08.152]  We've had a lot of the cases here in Central Texas.
[01:55:08.812 --> 01:55:17.221]  Japan is developing, Toshiba, the company in Japan is developing RFID tag systems for apparel stores.
[01:55:17.972 --> 01:55:24.236]  Now they reported this years ago, these small tracker chips, but now they're rolling it out, put it in all the clothes, the track and trace shoe.
[01:55:24.837 --> 01:55:44.530]  Ashcroft, due to the growing heat, despite his Carnival Barker barnstorming tour, telling us Patriot Act is good for us, is now saying they're going to reveal Patriot Act data, because a bunch of articles came out saying they're using it in drug cases and misdemeanor cases, and so Ashcroft's going to try to explain himself on that.
[01:55:45.223 --> 01:55:48.504]  Saudis consider developing and deploying nuclear weapons.
[01:55:49.565 --> 01:55:59.329]  A sicko so-called rock group in Tampa Bay is going to have somebody commit suicide at their showing.
[01:55:59.349 --> 01:56:07.192]  This is just a cynical way to get attention and to get publicity and the sick radio stations that interview these people are doing the same thing.
[01:56:08.866 --> 01:56:11.727]  Also, Miami police are on an orange alert.
[01:56:11.887 --> 01:56:17.550]  An unconfirmed tip about a planned terrorist attack has prompted increased surveillance in the city as a precaution.
[01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.790]  Yeah.
[01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:23.853]  Came out last year in ABC News, the White House quote ordered fake terror alerts to quote create hysteria.
[01:56:24.633 --> 01:56:35.958]  Responding to an unsubstantiated intelligence from North Africa about plans for a terrorist attack in Miami this week, the second area-specific threat in the past couple of weeks, police have
[01:56:37.091 --> 01:56:39.071]  Boots of patrols to orange alert level.
[01:56:39.892 --> 01:56:45.573]  And that just means enslaving you, shoving you around, letting you know who the boss is while the border stays wide open.
[01:56:46.453 --> 01:56:48.354]  I've talked a lot about that show Threat Matrix.
[01:56:48.414 --> 01:56:55.615]  I saw the ad for it as a movie trailer where they show them torturing some guy, but torture is good and a loving American value.
[01:56:55.635 --> 01:56:58.876]  That's why I said, well, then I guess Joseph Mingle is good.
[01:56:58.896 --> 01:56:59.896]  You're going to say that.
[01:57:00.456 --> 01:57:02.937]  Well, now USA Today has given it a bad review.
[01:57:04.389 --> 01:57:05.310]  And I think that's good.
[01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:08.833]  There's a big backlash to this, and I've called for a boycott against ABC.
[01:57:09.834 --> 01:57:14.238]  Because, I mean, just from the ad I saw, their power is unlimited.
[01:57:14.658 --> 01:57:15.919]  No one can question them.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.101]  They torture people.
[01:57:17.461 --> 01:57:18.542]  Torture's good.
[01:57:18.562 --> 01:57:21.605]  This fall on ABC, you'll see your protectors.
[01:57:22.846 --> 01:57:26.809]  So Big Brother might watch you, but you shouldn't.
[01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:28.431]  That's what they say.
[01:57:29.441 --> 01:57:33.165]  EU Health Chief wants smoking ban in all pubs.
[01:57:33.245 --> 01:57:35.226]  See, it's about the UN and that treaty.
[01:57:35.567 --> 01:57:36.588]  It's about the EU.
[01:57:36.628 --> 01:57:39.650]  That's why you suddenly see them moving for smoking bans in your city.
[01:57:39.690 --> 01:57:40.791]  It's about control.
[01:57:40.811 --> 01:57:46.797]  If they can get that done locally on an international basis, pushing for it, they can get you to accept anything.
[01:57:47.739 --> 01:57:49.140]  By the way, I didn't talk about this yesterday.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:49.700]  I should have.
[01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:53.183]  Desis Sais, or however you pronounce it, Mexican Independence.
[01:57:53.503 --> 01:57:57.326]  They celebrate that in the public schools, but not the history of America.
[01:57:57.826 --> 01:58:00.608]  Did you know they don't even celebrate Mexican Independence in Mexico?
[01:58:00.968 --> 01:58:03.530]  It's not really celebrated, I was reading in a Mexican paper.
[01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:08.513]  But here it is, and it's pushed by the federal government, wanting to break America up.
[01:58:10.355 --> 01:58:11.475]  I mean, what's to celebrate?
[01:58:11.515 --> 01:58:13.077]  From one dictatorship to another?
[01:58:13.117 --> 01:58:13.657]  We'll be back.
[01:58:14.972 --> 01:58:19.316]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:58:19.516 --> 01:58:23.940]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:28.464]  There is a chance to use this disaster in a New World Order.
[01:58:28.564 --> 01:58:29.845]  A New World Order?
[01:58:30.783 --> 01:58:32.406]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:58:45.523 --> 01:58:55.787]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:58:55.987 --> 01:59:01.370]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:00:15.794 --> 02:00:20.296]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:00:20.636 --> 02:00:24.738]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:00:25.019 --> 02:00:25.579]  We listened.
[02:00:25.879 --> 02:00:30.861]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:00:31.142 --> 02:00:31.622]  We listened.
[02:00:32.002 --> 02:00:35.044]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:00:35.484 --> 02:00:36.024]  We listened.
[02:00:36.464 --> 02:00:40.006]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:00:40.126 --> 02:00:40.546]  I think so.
[02:01:06.365 --> 02:01:07.329]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:01:07.349 --> 02:01:08.955]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:19.432 --> 02:01:20.072]  Big Brother.
[02:01:20.753 --> 02:01:21.793]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.513 --> 02:01:23.614]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.274 --> 02:01:25.094]  You want answers?
[02:01:25.855 --> 02:01:26.755]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.415 --> 02:01:31.157]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.597 --> 02:01:35.699]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:40.561]  You know, Barbie
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:49.462]  Dolls, admittedly, help create a generation of young girls that grow up to aspiring bimbos.
[02:01:51.682 --> 02:02:00.124]  And now you drive down any small town or big city street in America and you see 10, 11, 12 year old girls dressed up like streetwalkers.
[02:02:01.225 --> 02:02:02.225]  Only way to describe it.
[02:02:03.605 --> 02:02:05.466]  And Madonna's got her new children's book out.
[02:02:06.386 --> 02:02:10.147]  Well, Mattel, the maker of Barbie, has their new gang member doll.
[02:02:11.886 --> 02:02:17.308]  They've got a bunch of other children's toys that have come out where you're like gang members and where you wear certain outfits.
[02:02:17.528 --> 02:02:19.829]  And the police have all been trained, this is how criminals dress.
[02:02:20.610 --> 02:02:25.372]  You see people pulled over, it's folks that dress like this, people that act like this, whether they're white or black.
[02:02:25.952 --> 02:02:33.675]  And you're just, you know, telling your kids, get in the outfit, get into the subculture of drugs and underage sex and all this and materialism.
[02:02:34.415 --> 02:02:40.498]  You listen to hip-hop, it's all, I got gold, I got cars, I got rims, I got guns, I'm shooting everybody!
[02:02:41.578 --> 02:02:42.718]  I mean, I listen to it, folks.
[02:02:42.878 --> 02:02:44.339]  I monitor radio.
[02:02:45.819 --> 02:02:56.201]  And I mean, I'd say 8 out of 10 songs are the most mindless, materialistic, not just training your daughters how to be a bimbo or a whore, but how to, you know, just getting them into that culture.
[02:02:58.242 --> 02:03:06.423]  And they've got a PBS special where they celebrate this, that, oh, the underage 13-year-old girls run off to be with the 20-year-old gang members at group sex meetings.
[02:03:06.563 --> 02:03:10.224]  Oh, well, this is how they stand up and show their individuality.
[02:03:12.213 --> 02:03:14.114]  It's how to destroy the youth of this country.
[02:03:14.194 --> 02:03:29.159]  Saying they're simply appealing to the market, Mattel has unveiled a new line of hip-hop dolls, sporting miniskirts, streetwise hairdos, tattoos, body piercings, proudly aimed at the 6 to 12 age bracket, the tweenies.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:40.483]  While Flava dolls are being sold by the company that makes the American icon Barbie, they have little in common with the more traditional dolls, which are bad enough.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:47.202]  Our research told us that a lot of young girls are now aspiring to the world of rap and hip-hop music.
[02:03:47.322 --> 02:03:49.603]  Oh, aspiring to the world.
[02:03:49.763 --> 02:03:54.865]  Oh, yes, the prisons and the drugs and the gang raping.
[02:03:55.265 --> 02:03:58.767]  But tell spokeswoman Julia Jensen told the London Independent.
[02:03:59.047 --> 02:04:00.868]  And folks, I live right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:04:01.328 --> 02:04:02.148]  I see it everywhere.
[02:04:02.808 --> 02:04:04.949]  And the parents just go, oh, that's just the fad.
[02:04:05.469 --> 02:04:06.170]  Bye, honey.
[02:04:06.230 --> 02:04:07.670]  And say hi to their 13-year-old daughter.
[02:04:07.710 --> 02:04:09.331]  And I watched the 13-year-old daughter
[02:04:10.385 --> 02:04:18.228]  Literally, folks, with people that are at least 17, 18, swarming them, taking them out of the mall, disappearing.
[02:04:21.349 --> 02:04:23.290]  I mean, this is something else.
[02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:26.891]  And hey, you know, it's what the yuppies want to do, it's what the yuppies are going to do, you know?
[02:04:28.871 --> 02:04:32.793]  Each of the six dolls, known as the crew, oh, the crew, a gang member term,
[02:04:33.957 --> 02:04:41.180]  It comes with accessories including ghetto blasters, cell phones, and stick-on tattoos according to the London paper.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:05:00.187]  One character, Trey, is a black track, whatever that means, suited doll with a P. Diddy mole with goatee, string vest, and diamond earrings, the Flavas, and it says
[02:05:00.942 --> 02:05:02.684]  Pronounce Flavuz.
[02:05:03.405 --> 02:05:11.053]  Names include Happy D, Peebo, Tika, and Coyone Brown.
[02:05:12.334 --> 02:05:14.857]  And it says, Chairman of the British Association of Toy Retailers.
[02:05:14.877 --> 02:05:16.399]  Says he knew a lot of dolls.
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:20.343]  Speaks to the nature of the culture surrounding children.
[02:05:22.845 --> 02:05:26.947]  Yeah, and they've got like these death dolls, too, I saw in the Associated Press a few months ago.
[02:05:26.967 --> 02:05:28.628]  I don't have the name in front of me.
[02:05:28.648 --> 02:05:31.009]  I can't remember the specific details of it.
[02:05:31.029 --> 02:05:32.630]  It's just that they were like death dolls.
[02:05:34.071 --> 02:05:36.792]  And a lot worse than these.
[02:05:37.092 --> 02:05:39.854]  And it reminds me of this article I've got right here.
[02:05:43.624 --> 02:05:48.768]  Out of Bay News 9, front man for Hell on Earth takes his case to Bay Area Airwaves.
[02:05:49.228 --> 02:05:55.693]  The leader of shock rock band Hell on Earth took to the Airwaves Wednesday to explain why someone would want to commit suicide during the group's concert.
[02:05:56.294 --> 02:05:56.974]  And it goes on.
[02:05:57.014 --> 02:05:59.977]  You have all the young people in, glorify, suicide.
[02:06:00.857 --> 02:06:02.959]  And then wonder why you have a lot of teen suicide.
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:13.247]  And, you know, it's, look, Marilyn Manson, I went to a rock concert, folks, with my cousin, about, this had to be about,
[02:06:14.773 --> 02:06:15.734]  Eleven years ago.
[02:06:16.214 --> 02:06:17.495]  He said, come on to the concert.
[02:06:17.556 --> 02:06:20.038]  And it was just some kind of middle-of-the-road rock band.
[02:06:20.058 --> 02:06:21.439]  It wasn't some, you know, devil band.
[02:06:21.819 --> 02:06:27.424]  But opening for him, there were two bands opening, and the first opening act, you know, the junior act, was Marilyn Manson.
[02:06:27.984 --> 02:06:34.730]  This whole crowd of rock and roll listeners were throwing their beers at him, booing him, wanting him off the stage.
[02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:36.352]  Because they were singing about killing children.
[02:06:36.952 --> 02:06:38.253]  And my cousin and I left.
[02:06:38.373 --> 02:06:41.556]  We left the concert, folks.
[02:06:41.836 --> 02:06:42.557]  We left it.
[02:06:43.656 --> 02:06:44.836]  I mean, we're college students.
[02:06:46.417 --> 02:06:46.837]  We left.
[02:06:46.897 --> 02:06:50.758]  I mean, they had little babies' clothes stapled up on the speakers.
[02:06:50.838 --> 02:06:54.839]  He was vomiting on stage, cutting himself, saying, I love Satan, I want to kill children.
[02:06:55.619 --> 02:06:57.939]  Vomiting on stage, having demonic convulsions.
[02:06:58.139 --> 02:06:59.160]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:03.861]  And this big crowd, I mean, bikers, everyone was booing, throwing stuff at him.
[02:07:03.881 --> 02:07:04.661]  They didn't want to hear that.
[02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:07.052]  Well, let Viacom get it.
[02:07:07.413 --> 02:07:10.536]  They showed their video, showed them for years, and they didn't climb the charts.
[02:07:10.817 --> 02:07:14.181]  They just kept showing it and showing it until it became positive.
[02:07:14.561 --> 02:07:23.432]  And that is positive with the youth, sort of getting a positive response, started going up in the ratings, started selling their label.
[02:07:26.354 --> 02:07:47.754]  I remember watching a Frontline special about three years ago, you may have seen it on PBS, and they admitted that Viacom and MTV and others have whole office buildings full of like 25-year-olds who pose as tweenies and as teenagers, tweenies being pre-teen, pose as young people in chat rooms all over the place to promote this.
[02:07:48.274 --> 02:07:52.238]  So when the media says, oh, we're just giving them what they want, that's not true.
[02:07:54.412 --> 02:08:00.757]  I mean, style began by the fashion designers wanting to sell people a new wardrobe of clothes.
[02:08:00.798 --> 02:08:06.102]  It started back during, well, it really started in China as a way to enslave the emperors.
[02:08:06.142 --> 02:08:18.893]  The low-level minions learned that if they could make it stylish for the upper class to wear high heels and have foot-long fingernails, they'd have to be fed, they'd have to be controlled, and making that a status symbol, the dumb elite would buy into the style and be controlled by it.
[02:08:19.526 --> 02:08:34.718]  And in England and in Europe, in the French court, the British court, the Dutch court, and the Austrian-Hungarian courts, the artisans, the designers, we've heard the Emperor's new clothes, you know, they always had to have the bigger, the better outfits.
[02:08:35.639 --> 02:08:38.661]  And so, you know, the King would say, well, I've already got a hundred different outfits.
[02:08:38.681 --> 02:08:49.169]  They'd go, oh, but, but Your Grace, there's a new style, with the hat even longer, and the ladies must have an even tighter corset, you know, and all this stuff.
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:51.761]  So it goes on and on.
[02:08:52.241 --> 02:08:53.382]  It's a system of control.
[02:08:53.642 --> 02:08:55.243]  And so, yeah, it's about, oh, here's a new style.
[02:08:55.263 --> 02:08:56.784]  You gotta have it just to sell you more.
[02:08:57.084 --> 02:08:58.545]  But it's a lot more than that, folks.
[02:08:59.005 --> 02:09:02.447]  We've kind of reverted back to the Chinese model of, this is to destroy.
[02:09:03.788 --> 02:09:04.748]  This is admitted, okay?
[02:09:04.988 --> 02:09:08.470]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:11.572]  We're about to go to your calls.
[02:09:11.952 --> 02:09:12.553]  I know you're holding.
[02:09:12.573 --> 02:09:13.233]  We'll get to you in a second.
[02:09:15.305 --> 02:09:42.988]  And so, when you see them with groups like Hell on Earth, who are gonna, you know, have somebody commit suicide at their concert, and the Hemlock Society, others are going, oh, this is so good, and the guy's dressed up, you know, with white body paint, going, Satan, death, blah, hell pit, and, and, and the, you know, looks like a zombie, you know, kill, death, murder, and the crush, blah, blah, you know, this, and it's like, oh, it's so different, it's so cutting edge, it's so, and the young people stream in for this, and the government and the media give it attention.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:46.881]  They promote everything that destroys the family.
[02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:50.923]  They promote all this, uh, you know, oh, aspire to be in the ghetto.
[02:09:52.303 --> 02:09:55.725]  Aspire for your daughter to be involved in group sex.
[02:09:56.725 --> 02:09:58.886]  Uh, you know, aspire to be a whore.
[02:09:58.926 --> 02:10:02.388]  I mean, you ought to hear this culture and this music of hip-hop.
[02:10:04.549 --> 02:10:05.229]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:10:05.249 --> 02:10:11.672]  You tune into Fox Sports and it's in two, in about five minutes yesterday,
[02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:17.051]  Twenty times they must just talk about porno and porno parties they go to.
[02:10:17.071 --> 02:10:19.632]  You know, this is the nice conservative white guys.
[02:10:19.672 --> 02:10:20.473]  Ha ha ha!
[02:10:20.493 --> 02:10:26.556]  You know, how much fun it is to do all this stuff and discussions of drugs and alcohol and just mindlessness.
[02:10:26.576 --> 02:10:27.576]  It's just everywhere!
[02:10:29.177 --> 02:10:30.758]  And it's not that, oh, this sells.
[02:10:30.798 --> 02:10:31.798]  People want this.
[02:10:32.519 --> 02:10:33.719]  It's that they're pushing it.
[02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:37.561]  They're selling this culture of death.
[02:10:40.463 --> 02:10:42.704]  And so if you tell your children, hey, you can't
[02:10:44.202 --> 02:10:46.404]  Be involved in this because you're not old enough.
[02:10:46.424 --> 02:10:47.845]  They'll aspire to it.
[02:10:47.865 --> 02:10:51.528]  You have to tell them, no, this is designed by the government to enslave you.
[02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:55.992]  Okay, let's watch a documentary about Hitler, how he enslaved people.
[02:10:56.253 --> 02:10:57.854]  Let's watch a documentary about Stalin.
[02:10:58.254 --> 02:10:59.696]  Show your children documentaries.
[02:10:59.756 --> 02:11:00.396]  Explain to them.
[02:11:00.456 --> 02:11:01.457]  Read them history books.
[02:11:02.798 --> 02:11:04.019]  Deprogram them.
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.082]  Counterprogram them with critical thinking.
[02:11:07.602 --> 02:11:08.523]  Open their minds up.
[02:11:08.843 --> 02:11:10.645]  And then this stuff will bounce right off of them.
[02:11:12.188 --> 02:11:34.144]  But I'm telling you folks, I mean, I know good middle-class families of black people, white people, it doesn't matter, whose daughters at 13 are pregnant and you see the father of the child, you know, at a party or something and you're looking at a 13-year-old girl with a baby with some 18-year-old gang member slinking around.
[02:11:34.184 --> 02:11:35.385]  I mean, it's just sickening!
[02:11:36.926 --> 02:11:38.947]  Folks, the culture is unraveling.
[02:11:39.028 --> 02:11:40.869]  It is falling apart.
[02:11:41.676 --> 02:11:43.938]  It is just disintegrating.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:47.722]  And you won't hear the neocons talk about that.
[02:11:47.922 --> 02:11:49.383]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:11:50.324 --> 02:11:51.545]  I mean, Fox is the worst.
[02:11:51.685 --> 02:11:55.008]  Fox is the worst purveyor of this on their TV shows.
[02:11:55.349 --> 02:11:57.931]  Destroying male role models, all this trash.
[02:11:58.432 --> 02:11:59.933]  And that's your neocon provider.
[02:12:00.654 --> 02:12:02.215]  We'll come back and take some calls at 1-800-259-9231 for

[02:12:15.883 --> 02:12:20.725]  Frontman for Hell on Earth, takes his case to Bay Area Airwave for Suicide is Rock concert.
[02:12:21.946 --> 02:12:24.146]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[02:12:25.627 --> 02:12:27.308]  By the way, women's liberation?
[02:12:27.948 --> 02:12:30.309]  Gloria Steinem now admits she was hired by the CIA.
[02:12:31.457 --> 02:12:33.058]  To get women into the factories.
[02:12:33.718 --> 02:12:33.918]  Ms.

[02:12:35.399 --> 02:12:35.739]  government.
[02:12:36.139 --> 02:12:38.540]  That is now admitted, folks, mainstream news.
[02:12:40.921 --> 02:12:55.687]  You see, break you up, make sure your kids are, you know, in a dirty crib at daycare, being taught nothing, getting all their vaccines, drinking all their fluoride, drinking all their Coca-Cola's by the time they're two, on Prozac and Ritalin by the time they're five,
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.246]  Folks, the elite needs to dumb us down so there's no competition or rivals.
[02:13:03.207 --> 02:13:05.730]  It's like a male grizzly bear will come in and kill cubs.

[02:13:09.515 --> 02:13:12.579]  101 warfare by the elite if we're going to survive this thing.

[02:17:18.379 --> 02:17:19.260]  I'm about to go.
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:34.832]  I'm about to go to Chris, and Manuel, and Richard, and Jerry, and everybody else, but what I was trying to make is fashion fads have always been used as the cutting edge of tyranny.
[02:17:35.833 --> 02:17:43.859]  The Nazis, man, they had fancy black uniforms, fancy black pants and brown shirts, you know, neat armbands, black boots,
[02:17:45.634 --> 02:17:54.701]  They actually wore the fashion, the fashion in the early 30's just so happened to be those big black boots and dark outfits.
[02:17:55.241 --> 02:18:00.025]  And so Hitler adopted that and used, oh look the Nazis are so fashionable.
[02:18:01.366 --> 02:18:03.228]  And it's the same system over and over again.
[02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:04.969]  They sell it to you as fashion.
[02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:07.371]  They're sexualizing your children.
[02:18:08.032 --> 02:18:09.693]  They're a bunch of trash, folks.
[02:18:10.834 --> 02:18:12.135]  They're a bunch of garbage.
[02:18:13.197 --> 02:18:18.079]  I was over at a friend's house last night and taking care of some business on a film I'm working on.
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.881]  We went in and we're having some dinner at about 9 o'clock at night and I was turning on the television.
[02:18:24.901 --> 02:18:27.983]  We were surfing around Comedy Central, to the news, to other channels.
[02:18:28.003 --> 02:18:30.484]  It was all about sexualizing the youth.
[02:18:30.544 --> 02:18:31.544]  It was all about drugs.
[02:18:31.564 --> 02:18:33.785]  It was all about... It was incredible, folks.
[02:18:34.785 --> 02:18:36.766]  I mean, I just... It's horrible.
[02:18:36.806 --> 02:18:38.247]  They want to destroy innocence.
[02:18:38.727 --> 02:18:40.427]  They want to get your children into the prison system.
[02:18:40.447 --> 02:18:41.808]  Let me cover this and we'll go to your calls.
[02:18:43.658 --> 02:18:48.041]  This is out of USA Today, talking about another fad, a way to sell you slavery.
[02:18:49.562 --> 02:18:53.724]  Big Brother might watch you, you shouldn't.
[02:18:55.405 --> 02:18:57.307]  Again, Big Brother might watch, you shouldn't.
[02:18:57.767 --> 02:19:02.130]  USA Today, this is by Robert Bianco, USA Today.
[02:19:02.250 --> 02:19:04.211]  How nice to know we have nothing to fear.
[02:19:06.883 --> 02:19:08.003]  Worried about terrorists?
[02:19:08.104 --> 02:19:17.667]  Well, you won't be after ABC's Threat Matrix introduces you to the all-wise, all-powerful, that's what they say in the app, that's why they say it, super-secret operatives of the Homeland Security Agency.
[02:19:17.987 --> 02:19:26.691]  You'll rest easy knowing our homeland heroes are tracking would-be terrorists' movements by satellite, monitoring their radio transmissions, listening on their phones,
[02:19:27.415 --> 02:19:28.736]  ...calls and reading their emails.
[02:19:28.876 --> 02:19:30.296]  Nothing or nobody gets past them.
[02:19:30.356 --> 02:19:30.556]  See?
[02:19:30.917 --> 02:19:31.797]  Massive training.
[02:19:31.837 --> 02:19:32.918]  There's no liberty or freedom.
[02:19:33.378 --> 02:19:37.119]  Using fad to sell this with the hottest actors and actresses.
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:42.202]  I saw the ad of this and actually, physically, almost jumped up and attacked the movie screen.
[02:19:43.042 --> 02:19:48.525]  I went to see it two weeks ago to see Open Range and they showed them torturing some guy and it was good!
[02:19:48.845 --> 02:19:50.526]  I mean, that makes me mad, folks!
[02:19:50.746 --> 02:19:53.967]  That makes me a lot madder than turning our kids into gang members!
[02:19:54.587 --> 02:19:55.488]  That's even worse!
[02:19:58.934 --> 02:20:01.035]  Look, there's no, and it goes, I'll sleep easier.
[02:20:01.055 --> 02:20:22.546]  And it continues, all those chicken littles who worry that an agency with such powers might use them to infringe on civil liberties and rights, Brett Maitrex has an answer for you, as well as when a clearly foolish and probably leftist reporter asked the guy in charge how we know the agency won't spy on American citizens, he simply says, because it's against the law.
[02:20:23.346 --> 02:20:23.647]  Right.
[02:20:24.227 --> 02:20:26.188]  That's not what Total Information Awareness Network said.
[02:20:27.586 --> 02:20:29.447]  I know all sleep easier, the writer says.
[02:20:29.967 --> 02:20:32.868]  Look, there's no question Threat Matrix is terrible.
[02:20:33.248 --> 02:20:39.089]  The only question is which of its many hideous attributes is the worst.
[02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:44.951]  It attempts to pass high-tech twaddle off as reality.
[02:20:45.611 --> 02:20:55.654]  Its unscrupulous desire to crash in on a nationwide trauma, to cash in on a nationwide trauma, or the shattering incompetence it brings to both tasks.
[02:20:56.035 --> 02:20:56.475]  This is what 24
[02:20:58.201 --> 02:21:04.488]  Uh, would brief the scripts with terrible, and the cast was negligible, whatever that means.
[02:21:04.768 --> 02:21:09.794]  This is what 24 would brief the scripts were terrible, and the cast was negligible.
[02:21:09.914 --> 02:21:14.899]  Well, I mean, 24, Threat Matrix, this is federal government, folks.
[02:21:14.939 --> 02:21:18.843]  I mean, Lionel Chitwin making the movie about Bush, the hero of 9-1-1.
[02:21:20.652 --> 02:21:24.675]  Tonight's premiere opens with a prolonged attack on America's missile silo.
[02:21:24.715 --> 02:21:31.921]  You may think it's terrorists, but it's just those crazy kids from Homeland Security making us all safer by running off with a nuclear warhead to prove their point.
[02:21:32.442 --> 02:21:39.788]  They drive the warhead right in the middle of the downtown D.C., which I must say would seem to be just a tad rash.
[02:21:40.809 --> 02:21:45.993]  The leaders of the elite force are John Kilmer, James Denton, and his ex-wife Frankie.
[02:21:46.533 --> 02:21:47.394]  And it goes on and on.
[02:21:50.973 --> 02:21:54.195]  Folks, they don't mention the real problems with Threat Matrix.
[02:21:54.716 --> 02:21:55.756]  Folks, I saw the ad.
[02:21:56.997 --> 02:21:58.298]  They're power unlimited.
[02:21:58.638 --> 02:22:00.299]  They're control unquestioned.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:03.081]  Unorthodox ways of getting answers.
[02:22:03.121 --> 02:22:08.584]  And they got this guy with lesions, bruises all over him strapped down to some high-tech torture device.
[02:22:10.025 --> 02:22:17.710]  And there's some loving woman torturing him, and she just says, I don't like having to do this, but I'm going to torture you.
[02:22:17.890 --> 02:22:19.811]  I mean, I can't handle it, folks.
[02:22:22.836 --> 02:22:31.863]  Folks, do you realize how evil it is when they show torture on TV and say it's good?
[02:22:31.883 --> 02:22:34.646]  I mean, let me give you a wake-up call.
[02:22:34.966 --> 02:22:36.507]  This is mass programming.
[02:22:37.928 --> 02:22:38.549]  It's admitted.
[02:22:39.463 --> 02:22:40.963]  The government is writing the scripts.
[02:22:41.363 --> 02:22:54.146]  There is an agenda to desensitize you to death, and destruction, and drugs, and promiscuity, to break up the family, to put all the women in the factories, to give the children to the state.
[02:22:55.946 --> 02:22:57.187]  This is the plan.
[02:22:57.987 --> 02:22:59.687]  Wake up and resist it.
[02:23:00.767 --> 02:23:01.648]  It's unbelievable.
[02:23:01.668 --> 02:23:03.448]  We'll be back with your calls right after this break.
[02:23:05.468 --> 02:23:06.409]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.869 --> 02:23:08.389]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.389 --> 02:23:12.171]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.854 --> 02:23:19.137]  You are what you eat, and that's why people are turning to nutritional supplements.
[02:23:19.477 --> 02:23:22.059]  The question is, what is the quality of those supplements?
[02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:26.162]  One company, Verified Quality, has actually set the standards in the industry.
[02:23:26.182 --> 02:23:30.866]  To save America, learn and teach others how to say no when asked for a social security number.
[02:23:30.946 --> 02:23:32.948]  Visit nonumber.com or call 1-800-831-6141.
[02:23:46.332 --> 02:23:58.323]  At the end of this USA Today review of Threat Matrix, they say that basically all it shows is satellites watching everything we do and the phone lines all being listened into.
[02:23:58.924 --> 02:23:59.584]  And that's the point.
[02:23:59.804 --> 02:24:00.385]  Acclimate you.
[02:24:00.405 --> 02:24:00.925]  Condition you.
[02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:02.146]  Oh, this is for our safety.
[02:24:02.527 --> 02:24:03.688]  Everything we do is watched.
[02:24:04.742 --> 02:24:14.207]  See, and now they admit in the news that, oh yeah, the new terror laws will be used for all crimes against all citizens in non-terror related cases.
[02:24:14.807 --> 02:24:16.188]  And we never said it wouldn't be.
[02:24:16.608 --> 02:24:18.389]  We go, uh, excuse me, you did too.
[02:24:19.249 --> 02:24:20.250]  No, that's not true.
[02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:21.070]  You're a liberal.
[02:24:21.490 --> 02:24:22.631]  And you go, no I'm not a liberal.
[02:24:23.572 --> 02:24:27.734]  You see, if you're a conservative criticizing it, they'll call you a liberal.
[02:24:27.774 --> 02:24:30.335]  If you're a liberal criticizing it, they'll call you a right winger.
[02:24:31.235 --> 02:24:34.297]  See, the left is told that only extremist right wingers are against this.
[02:24:35.057 --> 02:24:41.760]  And then the right wing is told that only left wingers are against it when really the so-called left and right wing are all a bunch of idiots following the New World Order.
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:44.981]  The agenda of Hillary Clinton and George Bush is identical.
[02:24:45.221 --> 02:24:46.562]  The voting record is identical.
[02:24:47.142 --> 02:24:48.703]  They're just different rhetoric, folks.
[02:24:49.203 --> 02:24:50.283]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:24:50.964 --> 02:24:56.126]  And I wish the so-called conservatives out there on talk radio would start coming out against Bush a little more.
[02:24:57.046 --> 02:25:01.788]  I hear them on radio all day bashing Clinton, bashing Hillary, bashing Jesse Jackson.
[02:25:02.088 --> 02:25:03.569]  Yes, we know they're a problem.
[02:25:05.089 --> 02:25:13.017]  But the bigger problem is the Trojan horse, the camouflaged enemy, that is the enemy combatant neocon squad.
[02:25:13.217 --> 02:25:15.059]  They are the destroyers.
[02:25:16.581 --> 02:25:17.782]  They're getting the agenda through.
[02:25:17.802 --> 02:25:21.045]  Got a bunch of other news coming up, but let's get through some great calls here.
[02:25:21.386 --> 02:25:22.607]  Preston, Kentucky, go ahead.
[02:25:24.625 --> 02:25:25.445]  Good to talk to you.
[02:25:25.985 --> 02:25:27.626]  Lord Ashcroft's here in Louisville today.
[02:25:28.206 --> 02:25:29.046]  Oh, Lord Ashcroft.
[02:25:29.066 --> 02:25:31.367]  Did they play Imperial Battle March for him?
[02:25:31.447 --> 02:25:32.207]  They must have.
[02:25:32.467 --> 02:25:33.127]  They must have.
[02:25:33.547 --> 02:25:35.388]  We've got a group of protesters.
[02:25:35.428 --> 02:25:37.608]  It was on a local talk radio show this morning.
[02:25:38.409 --> 02:25:46.731]  I gave the problem reaction solution of history of the burning of the Reichstag, the Northwoods document, the 1993 World Trade Center building, Oklahoma City.
[02:25:47.311 --> 02:25:48.111]  I laid it on there.
[02:25:48.797 --> 02:25:51.858]  And what did the local host say when you laid out the historical facts?
[02:25:52.258 --> 02:25:56.620]  Uh, he's from the ACLU and he said I was absolutely correct.
[02:25:56.700 --> 02:26:09.025]  But see, that's the problem, is that they'll only allow the controlled left wing to agree this is government sponsored terror, then a Wesley Clark or a Hillary gets in and suddenly they won't see all the corruption anymore.
[02:26:09.085 --> 02:26:14.988]  See how they take a step with the right wing, they take a step with the left wing, and the conservatives can see the corruption of the left,
[02:26:15.643 --> 02:26:20.126]  And the left can see the corruption of the conservatives, but no one can see the whole picture.
[02:26:20.546 --> 02:26:20.786]  Right.
[02:26:20.926 --> 02:26:21.647]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:21.667 --> 02:26:22.968]  There's no left or right.
[02:26:23.588 --> 02:26:25.069]  It's all staged, is what it is.
[02:26:25.089 --> 02:26:36.316]  And you know, this weekend, they've had all these swat team display shows, you know, photos of how great they are, these little kids putting on black helmets and how they're going to be posing their saviors.
[02:26:36.396 --> 02:26:40.039]  It just makes me sick reading all this, how they're conditioning the little kids.
[02:26:40.928 --> 02:26:48.295]  Hey, the Nazis would have community parties and would let the kids dress up in the uniforms and everybody wanted one of those black uniforms and it was all style.
[02:26:48.355 --> 02:26:50.076]  It was fashionable.
[02:26:50.356 --> 02:26:53.239]  And that's exactly what they were doing with the Metro-Local Police Department.
[02:26:53.279 --> 02:26:55.140]  How great that is for Homeland Security.
[02:26:55.861 --> 02:26:57.322]  I mean, this is the system.
[02:26:58.669 --> 02:27:04.053]  I mean, it's just, I hope we get a lot of protesters going downtown today about this Patriot Act.
[02:27:04.714 --> 02:27:07.236]  I think it's a big, big deal.
[02:27:07.296 --> 02:27:15.943]  They had 1,200 show up at one of the last places that Lord Ashcroft went to and they played the Imperial Battle March in the background as Lord Ashcroft marched around.
[02:27:16.783 --> 02:27:18.465]  I've got to wait to see when the news comes on.
[02:27:18.505 --> 02:27:20.066]  I know they're going to twist it.
[02:27:21.207 --> 02:27:22.368]  They're going to twist this whole thing.
[02:27:22.428 --> 02:27:25.090]  He had an open meeting and everyone loved him.
[02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:26.511]  Yeah, that's what they're going to say.
[02:27:26.531 --> 02:27:27.452]  He's so conservative.
[02:27:28.004 --> 02:27:30.085]  And then I'll select every personal interview.
[02:27:30.165 --> 02:27:30.945]  Oh, he was great.
[02:27:31.005 --> 02:27:31.766]  It's wonderful.
[02:27:31.886 --> 02:27:32.786]  It's great for safety.
[02:27:32.806 --> 02:27:37.528]  You've got to give up some liberty for security when that's exactly the opposite of what the Founding Fathers said.
[02:27:37.548 --> 02:27:42.410]  But again, Ashcroft's Justice Department teaches police that all Founding Fathers and Christians are terrorists.
[02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.931]  Right.
[02:27:43.711 --> 02:27:43.991]  Yeah.
[02:27:44.071 --> 02:27:46.312]  John Ashcroft's a member of the Brotherhood, folks.
[02:27:46.332 --> 02:27:49.453]  He's not a Christian, according to the mainstream news.
[02:27:49.734 --> 02:27:50.334]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:50.354 --> 02:27:50.894]  Appreciate it.
[02:27:50.954 --> 02:27:51.394]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:51.594 --> 02:27:53.335]  This is all right out in the open, folks.
[02:27:54.035 --> 02:27:55.336]  Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:27:55.376 --> 02:27:56.036]  Welcome, Manuel.
[02:27:56.236 --> 02:27:56.877]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:27:57.984 --> 02:27:58.785]  I got a point to make.
[02:27:58.825 --> 02:28:02.847]  I'll try to make this concise, but I think it's important you need to understand what I'm about to say.
[02:28:04.068 --> 02:28:08.711]  You understand that when you see these Christians on TV, they do not represent Christianity.
[02:28:09.171 --> 02:28:09.672]  Right or wrong?
[02:28:10.893 --> 02:28:11.913]  Well, I understand that.
[02:28:11.993 --> 02:28:13.434]  Yeah, that's what I made the point.
[02:28:13.574 --> 02:28:15.035]  I consider myself a Christian.
[02:28:15.115 --> 02:28:15.596]  Exactly.
[02:28:15.636 --> 02:28:19.438]  But I don't consider Pat Robertson saying China has to have forced abortion.
[02:28:19.758 --> 02:28:21.640]  I'm sorry, abortion isn't Christian.
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.720]  I'm not going to say it is.
[02:28:22.801 --> 02:28:23.361]  Here's the thing.
[02:28:24.801 --> 02:28:29.003]  An ignorant person would see these Christians on TV and that demonizes them.
[02:28:29.023 --> 02:28:30.723]  This is purposely done by the powers that be.
[02:28:31.024 --> 02:28:32.404]  The whole Christian culture.
[02:28:32.584 --> 02:28:32.984]  Totally.
[02:28:33.004 --> 02:28:34.085]  That's why that guy...
[02:28:37.794 --> 02:28:43.455]  I mean, TBN with Mr. Crouch, it looks like the set of a New Orleans Bardello.
[02:28:43.855 --> 02:28:44.495]  It's filthy.
[02:28:44.535 --> 02:28:45.836]  Now, here's what you need to understand.
[02:28:45.876 --> 02:28:55.138]  I mean, literally, it's a whorehouse set with these guys walking around with somebody with 100 IQ or higher knows their total cons.
[02:28:55.158 --> 02:29:03.939]  Well, let me tell you what... And the average person tunes in and sees that and totally gets sold that Christianity has this whorehouse image.
[02:29:04.319 --> 02:29:07.360]  Now, I want you to substitute that for the hip-hop culture.
[02:29:07.967 --> 02:29:18.750]  BET and MTV, that mutated, filthy, perpetual mental and even physical death, those icons of death that you see on those channels, do not represent hip-hop culture.
[02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:23.231]  It's not a coincidence that that filth is what is shown to be hip-hop.
[02:29:23.431 --> 02:29:28.612]  See, because they want to destroy the young people of this land.
[02:29:28.852 --> 02:29:35.414]  But when you call us a gangster, Alex, ignorantly doing so because of what you see on TV, I'm not a gangster.
[02:29:35.734 --> 02:29:36.214]  I live
[02:29:36.744 --> 02:29:39.166]  Breathe and sleep hip-hop, but I'm not a gangster.
[02:29:39.306 --> 02:29:43.189]  That, which is on TV, we screen that down all of the time.
[02:29:43.449 --> 02:29:45.171]  We're right here with you fighting side by side.
[02:29:45.511 --> 02:29:46.312]  We're not gangsters.
[02:29:46.372 --> 02:29:47.513]  We're women in clothes.
[02:29:47.793 --> 02:29:49.434]  Manuel, Manuel, hold on just a second.
[02:29:50.935 --> 02:29:55.579]  You have to understand that I have to use the term that people understand.
[02:29:55.599 --> 02:30:02.205]  You know, every time I get on the radio and I say pirate radio, I get... Well, if you could at least do this, Alex... Let me just talk.
[02:30:02.625 --> 02:30:04.266]  Please, please, could you shut it down?
[02:30:04.486 --> 02:30:05.087]  I just want to talk.
[02:30:05.882 --> 02:30:07.263]  And then I'll let you finish up.
[02:30:07.543 --> 02:30:07.863]  Okay.
[02:30:09.164 --> 02:30:12.385]  I'm trying to give you a semantical example here of what I'm talking about.
[02:30:13.706 --> 02:30:14.066]  Okay?
[02:30:15.427 --> 02:30:30.454]  Every time I get on the radio and I talk about micro-FM, okay, unlicensed radio stations, that pick up this show and other shows, I call, I will say, pirate radio because 90% of our audience doesn't know
[02:30:31.897 --> 02:30:34.018]  Won't know what I'm talking about if I say Micro-FM.
[02:30:34.398 --> 02:30:36.239]  I'm not saying those stations are pirates.
[02:30:36.639 --> 02:30:37.959]  I'm not saying they're bad.
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:39.160]  I say they're good.
[02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:42.521]  I'll say Pirate Radio, you know, Micro-FM.
[02:30:42.781 --> 02:30:44.902]  I'm teaching folks what the word means.
[02:30:45.663 --> 02:30:54.066]  So when I say hip-hop or rap, I mean, look, the artist Parrish, a pretty popular guy, do you know who I'm talking about?
[02:30:54.682 --> 02:30:55.283]  Never heard of him.
[02:30:55.463 --> 02:30:56.664]  Okay, well he's out in San Francisco.
[02:30:56.684 --> 02:31:00.408]  You know, he does some great music about the New World Order.
[02:31:00.428 --> 02:31:02.270]  And, you know, he's hip-hop.
[02:31:02.730 --> 02:31:04.232]  And there's a lot of people that do.
[02:31:04.592 --> 02:31:05.153]  And you're right.
[02:31:05.193 --> 02:31:07.155]  They never get record company attention.
[02:31:07.635 --> 02:31:09.637]  I'm not saying everyone that's in hip-hop.
[02:31:09.758 --> 02:31:12.620]  I mean the hip-hop that Viacom... Exactly.
[02:31:12.681 --> 02:31:16.404]  And the hip-hop that's being sold on the airwaves... This is the problem, Alex.
[02:31:16.544 --> 02:31:16.985]  Hold on.
[02:31:17.085 --> 02:31:17.906]  It's just like...
[02:31:19.179 --> 02:31:21.100]  I hear similar stuff on country music.
[02:31:21.260 --> 02:31:26.324]  There's a new song about, uh, whiskey for my men, beer for my horses that Willie Nelson's in.
[02:31:26.424 --> 02:31:27.444]  I attack Willie Nelson.
[02:31:28.545 --> 02:31:31.767]  The song is about killing people without a trial, about police state.
[02:31:32.287 --> 02:31:33.028]  It's everywhere.
[02:31:33.048 --> 02:31:34.389]  I just attacked ABC.
[02:31:34.829 --> 02:31:35.970]  I attacked the cartoons.
[02:31:36.030 --> 02:31:37.230]  I attacked Pat Robertson.
[02:31:37.531 --> 02:31:45.736]  They've got their whores everywhere, and so when I said hip-hop, I mean what people think of as hip-hop, because that's what they've been sold.
[02:31:45.756 --> 02:31:47.477]  Well, you need to say at least
[02:31:48.223 --> 02:31:50.504]  I didn't just attack hip-hop, I talked about
[02:32:11.668 --> 02:32:12.669]  That's not a hip-hop doll.
[02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:15.332]  And what is a streetwise hairdo?
[02:32:15.632 --> 02:32:16.133]  What is that?
[02:32:16.893 --> 02:32:19.156]  Those do not represent hip-hop, those dolls.
[02:32:19.536 --> 02:32:20.777]  That's savagery.
[02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:21.938]  That's nonsense.
[02:32:22.079 --> 02:32:22.899]  A hip-hop doll.
[02:32:22.939 --> 02:32:26.103]  There is no such thing as a hip-hop doll and a streetwise hairdo.
[02:32:26.523 --> 02:32:27.284]  It's disgusting.
[02:32:27.744 --> 02:32:33.270]  What I'm saying is, it doesn't matter how somebody dresses, but the cops are told, somebody that dresses like this,
[02:32:34.022 --> 02:32:37.585]  This shows that there's statistically blah blah blah.
[02:32:37.886 --> 02:32:42.650]  You're putting on a uniform that their people have been trained to alert to.
[02:32:43.111 --> 02:32:47.595]  You're putting on an outfit that a bloodhound has been trained to track.
[02:32:48.115 --> 02:32:52.920]  It's like me telling the militia, stop wearing camouflage, you're not in Southeast Asia.
[02:32:53.723 --> 02:33:00.049]  When you put on a camouflage uniform and strut around, you're sticking out like a sore thumb.
[02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:03.432]  You're playing their ball game.
[02:33:03.813 --> 02:33:04.954]  You're absolutely right, see?
[02:33:05.234 --> 02:33:06.596]  But that does not represent hip-hop.
[02:33:06.636 --> 02:33:07.757]  They want you to believe that.
[02:33:07.797 --> 02:33:08.497]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:33:08.517 --> 02:33:11.901]  What does it mean to have your pants hanging down off of you?
[02:33:12.421 --> 02:33:13.202]  Well, why would you ask me?
[02:33:13.242 --> 02:33:14.783]  Because I don't wear my pants hanging down.
[02:33:15.043 --> 02:33:16.744]  I mean, I would ask that to anybody, sir.
[02:33:17.204 --> 02:33:18.945]  You would ask that to someone who dresses that way.
[02:33:19.425 --> 02:33:20.506]  Well, I don't dress that way.
[02:33:21.347 --> 02:33:22.788]  All the time I say, what does this mean?
[02:33:22.808 --> 02:33:23.348]  What does that mean?
[02:33:23.588 --> 02:33:25.029]  I'm asking, do you know what that means?
[02:33:25.449 --> 02:33:26.130]  I don't know what it means.
[02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:27.911]  It means if you're sitting in front of the TV for too long.
[02:33:27.951 --> 02:33:31.633]  It means if you're sitting in front of the TV for too long.
[02:33:32.433 --> 02:33:38.897]  A punk, a male whore in a prison would wear their pants hanging down.
[02:33:39.218 --> 02:33:39.538]  You're right.
[02:33:40.043 --> 02:33:47.086]  It means they've been sitting in front of the TV too long watching what they think is so-called cool because the powers that be told them that's what it is to be like.
[02:33:47.207 --> 02:33:47.907]  Exactly!
[02:33:47.987 --> 02:33:52.209]  So I'm here attacking the death metal, I'm attacking the establishment hip-hop.
[02:33:52.229 --> 02:33:53.409]  But you didn't make it clear, Alex.
[02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:56.051]  You're not saying the TV hip-hop, you're saying hip-hop culture.
[02:33:56.071 --> 02:33:57.471]  You said it yesterday and it's incredible.
[02:33:57.491 --> 02:34:01.573]  Yesterday I called in and I didn't get through because they asked me if I wanted to talk to Paul.
[02:34:02.114 --> 02:34:04.395]  But right after I hung up talking to Mark,
[02:34:05.094 --> 02:34:07.396]  Paul Watson made the point that he mentioned hip-hop.
[02:34:07.736 --> 02:34:10.398]  He didn't say TV powers that be promoted hip-hop.
[02:34:10.718 --> 02:34:11.539]  Mutated rap.
[02:34:11.899 --> 02:34:12.620]  He said hip-hop.
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:13.680]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:34:13.881 --> 02:34:14.661]  First, let me stop you.
[02:34:14.701 --> 02:34:15.822]  We don't screen phone calls.
[02:34:15.862 --> 02:34:16.703]  What are you saying happened?
[02:34:16.723 --> 02:34:17.283]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:17.343 --> 02:34:18.504]  I didn't say you screened the phone call.
[02:34:18.944 --> 02:34:19.365]  I know that.
[02:34:19.405 --> 02:34:21.146]  You absolutely do not screen phone calls.
[02:34:21.726 --> 02:34:24.108]  I called in, but you had Paul Watson on, you see?
[02:34:24.728 --> 02:34:25.669]  I wanted to talk to you.
[02:34:25.689 --> 02:34:27.851]  And Paul Watson was just reading a headline.
[02:34:28.071 --> 02:34:29.012]  See, but I... Exactly.
[02:34:29.032 --> 02:34:31.694]  But I wanted to talk to you, and it was about that, which he brought up.
[02:34:32.074 --> 02:34:33.555]  But it just so happens that I didn't get through.
[02:34:34.144 --> 02:34:38.067]  See, so when I was done talking to Mark, Paul Watson actually brought up hip-hop.
[02:34:38.527 --> 02:34:40.108]  And I said, well, look at that.
[02:34:40.128 --> 02:34:41.669]  I was just going to call in and talk about it.
[02:34:43.471 --> 02:34:45.072]  Well, anyway, I just wanted to make that point, Alex.
[02:34:45.312 --> 02:34:46.993]  OK, well, hey, I appreciate it.
[02:34:47.313 --> 02:34:52.477]  No, I'm not saying everyone in rock and roll is serving the New World Order.
[02:34:52.517 --> 02:34:55.019]  I'm not saying everyone in country music serves the New World Order.
[02:34:55.419 --> 02:34:56.540]  I'm not saying everyone...
[02:34:58.781 --> 02:35:01.323]  That's a great analogy of the TV preachers.
[02:35:01.483 --> 02:35:03.745]  Because it's the same exact situation.
[02:35:03.785 --> 02:35:05.806]  Well, you're right.
[02:35:05.886 --> 02:35:07.848]  I should say establishment hip-hop.
[02:35:07.868 --> 02:35:11.591]  Promoted culture of perpetual physical and mental death.
[02:35:11.991 --> 02:35:18.716]  There's actually a lot of... I know Paul Watson on our website has posted good hip-hop songs.
[02:35:19.717 --> 02:35:23.440]  In fact, I've seen him do that, that are uplifting against the New World Order.
[02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:27.983]  Look, if you emanate anything, any semblance of intelligence and vitality instead of death,
[02:35:28.913 --> 02:35:29.554]  And ignorance.
[02:35:30.054 --> 02:35:32.175]  You will not get on Vivendi Universe.
[02:35:32.195 --> 02:35:32.896]  You will not get promoted.
[02:35:32.936 --> 02:35:34.657]  I mean, certainly we've got to be careful about labels.
[02:35:34.677 --> 02:35:36.458]  I've taken too much time on this subject, sir.
[02:35:36.498 --> 02:35:37.098]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:35:37.238 --> 02:35:37.778]  Hey, you bet.
[02:35:37.798 --> 02:35:39.139]  Yeah, we have spent a lot of time on it.
[02:35:39.199 --> 02:35:44.522]  But, uh... We've actually posted good hip-hop music on our website.
[02:35:44.622 --> 02:35:46.023]  On PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:46.463 --> 02:35:49.065]  I got to ask Watson if he's listening to repost some of those songs.
[02:35:49.745 --> 02:35:53.427]  Post Paris' song that one I particularly like about the government's terror.
[02:35:54.408 --> 02:35:55.849]  Uh, to maybe post the, uh...
[02:35:57.330 --> 02:35:59.912]  The White America song by Eminem that's about the New World Order.
[02:36:00.453 --> 02:36:08.819]  Maybe you should post the other song... I forget the name of the group that was talking about the New World Order and government terror that I saw a few weeks ago.
[02:36:08.859 --> 02:36:12.082]  But we're not saying... I'm saying establishment hip-hop.
[02:36:12.102 --> 02:36:13.703]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:36:13.723 --> 02:36:14.804]  Okay, Richard in Alabama.
[02:36:14.864 --> 02:36:15.705]  Richard, you're on the air.
[02:36:15.725 --> 02:36:16.105]  Go ahead.
[02:36:17.386 --> 02:36:20.589]  Alex, I got a couple questions.
[02:36:20.849 --> 02:36:26.734]  Do the Democrats have any candidates running who are right-handed?
[02:36:29.648 --> 02:36:36.111]  I don't know if Leslie Clark's left-handed or right-handed or what's going on.
[02:36:37.912 --> 02:36:38.372]  I don't either.
[02:36:38.412 --> 02:36:39.113]  I don't watch them.
[02:36:39.793 --> 02:36:40.674]  Why do you ask?
[02:36:41.774 --> 02:36:53.400]  Well, I've heard that all of the Republican and Democrat nominees for president ever since Kennedy have been left-handed.
[02:36:54.741 --> 02:36:55.241]  Is that true?
[02:36:55.926 --> 02:36:58.949]  Anecdotally, it does, to my memory, it does seem that way.
[02:36:58.989 --> 02:37:00.171]  They all have been left handed.
[02:37:00.191 --> 02:37:02.953]  You know, it seems I have read that in the newspaper, but I don't want to say that.
[02:37:02.993 --> 02:37:03.894]  It could be an urban legend.
[02:37:03.934 --> 02:37:06.417]  I really don't get into esoteric stuff that often, Richard.
[02:37:07.077 --> 02:37:07.478]  Not sure.
[02:37:07.798 --> 02:37:09.500]  Well, let me ask you this about sedition.
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:16.467]  How far can a talk radio host go in criticizing the government before he can be charged with sedition?
[02:37:19.028 --> 02:37:25.630]  Well, I mean, you don't want to threaten anyone's life, but we don't do that because it's counterproductive.
[02:37:25.890 --> 02:37:27.211]  We're trying to wake people up.
[02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:31.592]  We know the pen is mightier than the sword, unless you're in a defensive situation.
[02:37:35.114 --> 02:37:37.314]  I mean, the people running the country aren't even running the country.
[02:37:37.334 --> 02:37:38.895]  The people you see are just puppets.
[02:37:39.375 --> 02:37:44.937]  So again, it would be ineffectual to do anything, period.
[02:37:46.239 --> 02:37:51.143]  It's the globalists that tend to go after their own minions, by the way, and that's who the globalists should worry about, the mid-level minions.
[02:37:51.823 --> 02:38:02.931]  Although, if you say the globalists, quite often, when it seems quite obvious, the government would substitute quite adequately for globalists.
[02:38:03.011 --> 02:38:11.577]  Yeah, well, what I'm saying is we have criminal crime rings that control key areas in the highest echelons of power in all major governments.
[02:38:14.623 --> 02:38:14.723]  Yeah.
[02:38:14.763 --> 02:38:19.045]  There were seven countries that weren't run by the globalists, and two of them have already been taken over.
[02:38:21.086 --> 02:38:22.046]  So there's five left.
[02:38:23.307 --> 02:38:24.287]  What are the five left?
[02:38:26.228 --> 02:38:28.889]  They are, well let's list them.
[02:38:29.069 --> 02:38:43.375]  They're Syria, Iran, there's a couple of Asian countries, some of the smaller ones, there's Libya, and again when I make that statement, it's not saying those governments are good or bad.
[02:38:44.356 --> 02:38:45.236]  They're bad governments.
[02:38:45.356 --> 02:38:49.877]  It's a bigger, badder government going after the smaller governments.
[02:38:49.917 --> 02:38:50.997]  And I don't know where you're going, Richard.
[02:38:51.017 --> 02:38:51.598]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:52.278 --> 02:38:54.018]  Let's talk to Jerry in Wisconsin.
[02:38:54.038 --> 02:38:54.338]  Go ahead.
[02:38:54.358 --> 02:38:54.938]  You're on the air.
[02:38:56.919 --> 02:38:57.419]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:57.479 --> 02:38:58.059]  How are you doing?
[02:38:58.139 --> 02:38:58.559]  Pretty good.
[02:39:00.299 --> 02:39:05.060]  Well, first of all, I just wanted to tell you I had ordered some information from y'all.
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:13.742]  And I just want you to know, I don't know if the post office is digging through the information, but when I had gotten it, it was opened.
[02:39:15.834 --> 02:39:16.335]  Oh, really?
[02:39:16.675 --> 02:39:17.075]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:17.336 --> 02:39:18.497]  Yeah, you know what happens?
[02:39:18.537 --> 02:39:20.178]  I'd say about one out of a hundred packages.
[02:39:21.299 --> 02:39:22.721]  Was there tape around your package?
[02:39:23.361 --> 02:39:25.303]  Yeah, it had the two tabs.
[02:39:26.304 --> 02:39:27.165]  No, no, no.
[02:39:27.225 --> 02:39:29.888]  Was there... We'll discuss stuff like this here on air.
[02:39:29.908 --> 02:39:30.869]  I think it's kind of good to do.
[02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:34.813]  I'm asking you, was there priority mail tape wrapped around it?
[02:39:35.613 --> 02:39:36.034]  Oh, no.
[02:39:36.972 --> 02:39:40.614]  Yeah, I've told my shipping folks to do that, and they've chosen not to.
[02:39:41.614 --> 02:40:01.104]  And I have to go up there and make sure that happens, because when they don't, there's not enough glue on that, it busts open, and you know, that's the reason I have trouble making a living here, because you know, probably, I don't know, 1 out of 80 or 1 out of 100 packages busts open, because the tape didn't put on it, and people always think it's a conspiracy, and no, it's because the tape wasn't put around it that they provide that you're supposed to put around it.
[02:40:02.185 --> 02:40:04.786]  So that's what happens, and so now I'm addressing it here on air.
[02:40:04.806 --> 02:40:06.487]  These are the tabs.
[02:40:07.271 --> 02:40:08.011]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:08.151 --> 02:40:12.492]  It's a priority box, and the glue... No, no, this wasn't a box.
[02:40:12.552 --> 02:40:15.753]  This is just information about what you have.
[02:40:15.773 --> 02:40:20.854]  Okay, well, the government's reading it and watching you, then, if that's what you want to think.
[02:40:21.595 --> 02:40:22.375]  Well, I don't know.
[02:40:22.395 --> 02:40:23.255]  I found it weird.
[02:40:23.295 --> 02:40:24.735]  I mean, you keep saying tabs.
[02:40:24.775 --> 02:40:25.896]  I don't know what a tab is.
[02:40:26.276 --> 02:40:34.978]  It's a tape, and there's two of them, one on the bottom and one on the top, and it closes
[02:40:35.788 --> 02:40:36.309]  I would say that
[02:40:46.815 --> 02:40:50.818]  And I've had mail like this before where it's never been like that.
[02:40:51.299 --> 02:40:56.382]  Well, I know that here in Austin, quite a few of the post people have gone to jail for stealing mail.
[02:40:56.863 --> 02:40:58.184]  They take insurance checks.
[02:40:58.224 --> 02:40:59.525]  They take videos and books.
[02:40:59.605 --> 02:41:01.446]  They've caught them taking stuff.
[02:41:01.606 --> 02:41:02.747]  Usually, it's just a thief.
[02:41:03.268 --> 02:41:11.554]  Maybe somebody checked to see if you... I know around Christmas, I've had a lot of cards when I was a kid opened up from Grandma and say, here's $50 for you, son.
[02:41:15.036 --> 02:41:19.357]  You're misunderstanding me, but that's alright.
[02:41:19.397 --> 02:41:21.018]  I'll just say the CIA is after you then.
[02:41:21.598 --> 02:41:22.619]  Of course, that's not the case.
[02:41:22.639 --> 02:41:27.860]  They don't have the personnel to do that, but you know how many people it would take and how much mail there is in the country?
[02:41:28.301 --> 02:41:29.241]  But hey, stay there.
[02:41:29.301 --> 02:41:31.142]  We'll run the show out talking about this.
[02:41:31.502 --> 02:41:32.202]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:36.924 --> 02:41:39.785]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.513 --> 02:41:41.813]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.013 --> 02:41:47.754]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:48.014 --> 02:41:53.295]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:53.576 --> 02:41:57.716]  Brace yourselves, as the new world order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[02:41:57.896 --> 02:42:01.677]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:01.937 --> 02:42:06.538]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.638 --> 02:42:12.922]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.962 --> 02:42:14.843]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:43:11.229 --> 02:43:11.729]  That's right.
[02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:19.034]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:41.818]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:44:42.358 --> 02:44:45.661]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:47.903 --> 02:44:54.428]  Okay, I had a chance to talk to Jerry in Wisconsin.
[02:44:54.448 --> 02:44:57.471]  It's kind of a new type of talk radio where we handle customer service on air.
[02:44:58.965 --> 02:45:00.646]  I do appreciate most of the videos and stuff.
[02:45:01.027 --> 02:45:02.507]  But I found out he didn't even order anything.
[02:45:02.527 --> 02:45:03.688]  He got a free brochure.
[02:45:03.788 --> 02:45:06.950]  It's one piece of paper and he thinks the government went through that paper.
[02:45:07.851 --> 02:45:10.872]  And so, what can I do for you?
[02:45:10.892 --> 02:45:16.215]  You were saying, now that I talked to you during the break, you got a free brochure and something was wrong with your free brochure.
[02:45:16.255 --> 02:45:17.716]  Tell folks about that.
[02:45:18.817 --> 02:45:23.800]  Well, it appeared that it had been opened and it wasn't opened by me.
[02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:24.720]  I know that.
[02:45:27.321 --> 02:45:28.642]  There must be agents everywhere then.
[02:45:28.662 --> 02:45:29.863]  Yeah, who knows?
[02:45:30.624 --> 02:45:33.787]  But excellent stuff in the brochure.
[02:45:33.807 --> 02:45:37.009]  I'm going to be handing this out to a lot of people.
[02:45:39.031 --> 02:45:41.173]  I know a lot of people... Wait, did you get a newsletter?
[02:45:45.776 --> 02:45:46.076]  No.
[02:45:46.317 --> 02:45:47.117]  You know, sir, I'm sorry.
[02:45:47.137 --> 02:45:47.917]  I'm flat out of time.
[02:45:47.997 --> 02:45:48.398]  Take care.
[02:45:48.438 --> 02:45:49.038]  Appreciate it.
[02:45:49.418 --> 02:46:00.664]  We'll send you more free brochures if you'd like, newsletters, and yes, there's a tiny piece of tape that holds the six-page newsletter together, and those bust open routinely, and I wouldn't want to say it was the government trying to get you.
[02:46:00.684 --> 02:46:01.525]  All right.
[02:46:02.205 --> 02:46:02.565]  Thank you.
[02:46:02.705 --> 02:46:04.046]  Thank you for the call.
[02:46:04.326 --> 02:46:06.527]  Really appreciate it.
[02:46:06.567 --> 02:46:08.949]  Boy, let's go to Paul in New Jersey.
[02:46:08.989 --> 02:46:09.769]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:46:10.129 --> 02:46:11.530]  Alex, just briefly.
[02:46:12.579 --> 02:46:19.765]  I've heard the other night a conservative talk show host, you know, decrying about Madonna's kiss on MTV.
[02:46:20.746 --> 02:46:32.215]  And I called and I basically said, how can you blame Madonna, not that she's any kind of cultural icon, for what happened on MTV when it was an MTV production?
[02:46:32.275 --> 02:46:33.696]  They produced that show.
[02:46:33.996 --> 02:46:35.598]  They have seven second delay.
[02:46:35.658 --> 02:46:37.199]  They had that pre-recorded.
[02:46:37.519 --> 02:46:39.541]  They could have edited it out.
[02:46:40.484 --> 02:46:41.245]  Well, that's it.
[02:46:41.385 --> 02:46:42.966]  I mean, it's all a stage fight.
[02:46:43.026 --> 02:46:51.734]  It's Sumner Redstone, it's Rupert Murdoch selling us this death, but it's never about the conservative leaders.
[02:46:52.235 --> 02:47:02.645]  And that's what was amazing, and so I tried to even mention the real name of Sumner Redstone, whose real name is Murray Rothstein, and obviously this talk show host tried to steer me away from that.
[02:47:02.685 --> 02:47:04.126]  He wouldn't allow me to say it.
[02:47:05.214 --> 02:47:13.299]  And so, here these conservatives, so-called conservatives, sit there and they decry what happens on the media, but they never blame the boss.
[02:47:13.928 --> 02:47:19.551]  Now, if that was the software glitch in Microsoft's software, oh, you'd hear, it's Bill Gates' fault.
[02:47:19.932 --> 02:47:21.032]  It's Bill Gates' fault.
[02:47:21.332 --> 02:47:25.915]  But why do they never hold the CEOs of these media companies?
[02:47:25.955 --> 02:47:29.617]  Well, I mean, they say Hillary's the problem when Bush has an identical voting record with her.
[02:47:29.657 --> 02:47:30.318]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:30.338 --> 02:47:31.018]  Yeah.
[02:47:31.198 --> 02:47:31.759]  A great point.
[02:47:31.779 --> 02:47:32.279]  Appreciate it.
[02:47:32.299 --> 02:47:33.480]  Real quick, Mike in Arizona.
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:33.860]  Go ahead.
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:34.840]  I'm sorry, we're out of time.
[02:47:35.121 --> 02:47:35.581]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:35.621 --> 02:47:40.864]  Yeah, I attended the Patriot Act meeting here, the so-called community meeting.
[02:47:41.519 --> 02:47:42.540]  With the local U.S.
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:42.960]  Attorney.
[02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:44.762]  It was actually at his office.
[02:47:44.962 --> 02:47:46.083]  How were you able to get in?
[02:47:47.524 --> 02:47:48.265]  I had called in.
[02:47:49.066 --> 02:47:59.735]  There was an article in the paper a couple weeks ago and they said it was coming and they said we don't have plans, definite plans yet, but give us your name and number and we'll call you back.
[02:47:59.795 --> 02:48:00.716]  And sure enough, they did.
[02:48:01.437 --> 02:48:05.660]  So about 100 people were allowed to attend along with probably about 25 media.
[02:48:09.119 --> 02:48:22.262]  They gave us numbers and took us up an elevator load at a time and sent us through the security check, said there was no recording, didn't give us a microphone to ask questions.
[02:48:22.422 --> 02:48:28.383]  They gave us 3x5 index cards to submit questions, and even those were not read by the moderator.
[02:48:28.703 --> 02:48:30.804]  He gave like a fake synopsis.
[02:48:31.539 --> 02:48:32.240]  Supposedly.
[02:48:32.940 --> 02:48:33.701]  He really didn't even do that.
[02:48:33.721 --> 02:48:35.222]  Did one of your questions get through?
[02:48:35.242 --> 02:48:35.682]  No.
[02:48:36.063 --> 02:48:37.664]  He just gave these guys softball questions.
[02:48:37.704 --> 02:48:40.406]  Hey Richard, call me back tonight, 9 to midnight, or back tomorrow.
[02:48:40.446 --> 02:48:41.807]  I want to hear more about this, okay?
[02:48:42.027 --> 02:48:42.728]  Yeah, I'll try to do that.
[02:48:42.828 --> 02:48:44.189]  Hey Karen, I'm sorry to everybody else.
[02:48:44.209 --> 02:48:45.430]  I didn't mean to get frustrated earlier.
[02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:49.893]  It's just that there's paranoia about stuff you don't have to be paranoid about.
[02:48:49.953 --> 02:48:54.797]  And then you're not paranoid about real stuff like a tracker chip in your cell phone.
[02:48:54.837 --> 02:48:58.640]  But, you know, it's just incredible.
[02:49:00.151 --> 02:49:01.252]  There are millions of us.
[02:49:01.272 --> 02:49:03.154]  There's only a few thousand globalists.
[02:49:03.834 --> 02:49:06.237]  A few hundred thousand of their actual spies and minions.
[02:49:06.257 --> 02:49:07.017]  We outnumber them.
[02:49:07.458 --> 02:49:09.399]  And most of their people are waking up right now.
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:11.081]  We're on the march.
[02:49:11.101 --> 02:49:12.002]  They're on the run.
[02:49:12.322 --> 02:49:12.862]  Stand up.
[02:49:13.023 --> 02:49:13.883]  Get out front.
[02:49:14.023 --> 02:49:14.724]  Get bold.
[02:49:16.065 --> 02:49:17.026]  And realize that.
[02:49:17.827 --> 02:49:20.009]  With coward fear, it's over for this society.
[02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.310]  Alright.
[02:49:21.370 --> 02:49:22.211]  Infowars.com.
[02:49:22.331 --> 02:49:23.031]  Take care.
[02:49:26.425 --> 02:49:33.938]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:34.219 --> 02:49:36.803]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because...
